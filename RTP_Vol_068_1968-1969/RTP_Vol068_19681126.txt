The question is, Is any effort at
all to increase interest in student
government worth the effort? For
some hints, consider last night's Bitch-
In:

The project depends on students
attending, armed with ideas. Only
fifty showed up last night, and they
all looked unhappy. Less than half
had anything to say. How does this
impress the E.C.? The Bitch-In_ en-
courages E.C. members who think
they operate in a government vacuum,

The project also depends on E.C.
interest and participation. Only four
members plus the president came (the
meeting was taped). Men like Pete
Hendricks, articulate and competent,

who spoke contemptuously and smirk-
ed when he wasn’t talking. The Bitch-
In encourages students who think the
E.C. is hopeless.

The project succeeds through open

and honest communication. Its format | ©

Enlarging upon an earlier work,
Dr. Allen W. Moger has written a
study of Virginia history entitled
“Virgnia: Bourbonism to Byrd, 1870-
1925." The book will be published
by the University Press of Virginia.

Mrs. Betty Munger, manager of the
WAL Bookstore, has scheduled a re-
ception and autograph party for Dr.
Moger on the publication date, Dec.
11. Invitations have been sent to pro-
fessors at W&L and nearby colleges.
The party will be from 4:00 to 5:30
p.m. at the Bookstore.

In 1940 Dr. Moger published his
doctoral dissertation “Rebuilding of
the Old Dominion, 1880-1902." He
explained, “A few years ago | began
expanding it backward and forward
to cover a longer period in history.”
His new book examines Virginia his-
tory from the state's readmission to
the Union in 1870 to the election of
Harry Flood Byrd as governor.

above the second floor of fraternities.

The SAC had three major reserva-
tions. First they objected to the lack
of regulations governing when and
under what circumstances girls would
be allowed above the first floor. Sec-
ondly, they were concerned because
there were no adequate facilities
above the first floor for the girls.
And thirdly, they wanted concrete
assurances that the changing of the
regulation would bring more upper-
classmen into the houses.

The IFC felt that girls should be
required to leave the second and
third floors at the same time that
they were required to leave the house
itself at either 2 or 3 a.m. Carter
stated that creating lounges on each
floor would be the best way to face
the problem of the lack of facilities
on the upper floors.

In further action junior justice Bob

instead of the 2 a.m. rule for some
of the weekends. He said that girls
are usually required to be out of
the fraternity houses by 2 a.m. and
not required to be at their hostesses
until 3 am. and that this put an
unfair burden on those who had no-
where to go after 2 am, The IFC

is left open. He urged that the houses

EC complaint session
scores student rights

In last night’s Executive Commit-
tee sponsored Bitch-In the prevalent
theme of all the questions and com-
ments from the students attending
were focused on protecting the stu-
dent from any arbitrary action by
the Executive Committee. President
Jay Passavant also flatly stated that
the EC had no intention to review
any of the recent decisions of the
Publications Board.

All who participated seemed to be
concerned with any potential arbi-
trary action of the EC against the
rights of the students. Topics dis-
cussed included the potential danger
of the EC executive session, codi-
fication of the honor system, rights
of an accused honor system violator
before his public trial, and the pro-
tection of the student against un-
reasonable search by either the Uni-
versity authorities or the EC.

The total students who attended
the much-publicized Bitch-In numb-
ered only about 50, while only five
member of the EC were present in-
cluding President Jay Passavant, Vice-

sentatives Pete Hendricks, Joe Tomp-
kins, and Staman Ogilvie.

The first topic discussed involved
the hypothetical danger of the Ex-
ecutive Committee going into closed
session to iron out any major dif-
ferences in a pending piece of legisla-
tion where the student body was
unable to watch the process. The
members of the EC present replied
that the executive session was used
only for matters involving individuals
in the student body and other de-
cisions which should not go into the
Ring-tum Phi such as the selection
of Who's Who and the Gilliam

The honor system came under ex-
treme criticism, One student said that,
for him, the honor system was much
too vague. Since one professor's con-
cept of honor may be much different
from another's, he felt that this
placed the individual student in the
midst of five or more conflicting
interpretations of honor. He felt that
the only plausible solution was to
write out a concrete code of regula-
tions as to what would be considered
an honor violation.

Passavant replied that there were
undoubtedly areas in which the honor

Barrett’s bequest

The Law School has recently re-
ceived $128,309 from the estate of
the late Jasper J. Barrett. Barrett
was a 1910 gaduate of the W&L
Law School. President Huntley said
that the University will use the be-
quest to establish and maintain with-
in the Law School library a special
collection dealing with probate law,
trusts, estate planning, taxation, and
related subjects.

The special collection will bear the
designation, “Donated by Jasper J.
Barrett, LL.B. 1910 and his wife,
Hazel Barrett.” Any remaining portion
of the bequest not required for
library purposes will be used to estab-
lish one or more scholarships for de-

Sears-Roebuck Foundation
gives $1,500 to W@L

Sears - Roebuck Foundation has
given WAL a $1,500 grant which was
contributed under the foundation's
continuing program of financial aid
to privately supported colleges and
universities.

WAL was one of 12 colleges in
Virginia to receive aid from Sears-
Roebuck. By the end of 1968, more
than 700 educational — institutions
throughout the country will have re-
ceived grants from the foundation.

The money will be probably used
in some area of institutional support
not yet decided.

The Director of University Devel-
opment, Mr. Farris P. Hotchkiss, ex-
plained that neither of the grants
received in the last week were re-
quested by the school, but instead
they were given by the foundations
on the basis of WAL's “excellence in
depth” in scholastic activities. Also
he said that the consecutive contri-
butions made by the foundations
show a continuing confidence in the

Bitching

the searching of student quarters for drugs, allegedly Uni-

But the overall result was,

Carter sees need
for conglomerate calendar

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

The institution of the midweek
road-trip to a surrounding girls’ school
seems to be a regular part of a
WAL student's social life.

While many such trips afe un-
premeditated flings, an equal num-
ber are planned to a certain extent.
But unfortunately, whether they are
planned or not, the majority of these
trips lack any real direction once the

student finds himself at the girls’
school. Usually the date begins with
the question, “Well, I don't know.

What do you want to do?”

With a glance at such a calendar a
student could see what opportunities

are available on other campuses such
as plays, concerts, and lectures.

If something on the conglomerate
calendar appealed to a student, he
could plan a road trip which would
combine the pleasure of a date with
an event having cultural value, rather
than the normal exodus from the
schools to the “boondocks” or cheap
beer joints. Since most of these events
welcome all students at no cost, the
inexpensiveness of the date is also
attractive.

CHANGE
T

~

disc unit

By MACK WOODWARD
Assistant Bditorial-Page Editor

After struggling all of this month
to change from the old 1620 IBM
computer to the 1130, the computer
staff is nearing the end of its task.
Soon the third-generation computer
will be in full operation.

The major problem
by the staff, according
was the revision in the programming
system. Specifically, the programming
done for the administrative offices
has created a problem in the code
used by the new computer. The 1620
had all of the administration's data
in the SPS code; the change to the
1130 requires the change to the new-
er code known as Fortran.

Most of this conversion has been
done by the computer staff, who
divided the work among themselves;
both Mr. Dudley and Dr. Wise have
done quite a bit of the work. By the
end of this week, the 1620 will have
been phased out of all the immediate
work with which it is concerned;
however, programming of the sec-
tioning will continue for two months,
at least, and possibly into next
semester.

The basic advantage of the 1130
is its ability to retain knowledge in a
memory bank. The 1620 was able to
program and process given material,
but the 1130 will be able to recall
stored material. It was for this reason
that the computer staff became inter-
ested in acquiring the 1130 for the
school.

encountered
to Dr. Wise,

x As the 1130 is basically different

from the 1620, it has caused a
change in the computer programming
classes. The classes, after having
studied the 1620 for some time this
fall, had to center their attention on
the 1130, a more complex third-gen-
eration computer.

The introduction of the 1130 com-
puter into the computer system will
facilitate processing of material for
all of the departments that make use
of the computer. The computer will
be able to do work more efficiently
than the old 1620, which required
time on the operator’s part to pro-
gram the data for the computer each
time it was used. The new computer,
with its recall abilities, will be able
to cut down on the time used not
only by the operator, but also by the
computer.

One of the major differences in the
two computers is the cost involved
in the new computer. The 1130 will
probably cost the University about
fifty per cent more than did the 1620.
This computer, however, will com-
pensate for the additional cost in the
greater amount of work done and
in the time it saves the programmers.
The specific figures have not yet been
released, but the fifty per cent mark
is conceded to be a general figure by
Dr. Wise.

As soon as the 1620 computer ts
phased out, it will no longer be need-
ed or used by the University. The
1130 will completely take over all
of the tasks that the 1620 performed.

The 1130 was first used early in

Ball & Brumback lead strong swimmers

By Reeve Kelsey and Roy Carlton

The W&L swimming team recently
concluded its pre-season conditioning
with an informal scrimmage against
VMI in VMI's 25 yard pool. Re-
turning, after Thanksgiving, the team
has four meets including two of its
toughest opponnets American and
Catholic Universities. The American
meet, in Lexington, is Saturday, De-
cember 6 with another meet the next
Monday against Roanoke College al-
so in Lexington.

 

Among Coach Stearns’s problems
include finding the way to maximize
the talents of Billy Ball, Bill Brum-
back, and freshman John Lawlor as
well as trying to plug the gap in
the breaststroke events left by graduat-
ing co-captain Pat Costello.

The Generals’ strongest point could
easily be their freestylers. Brumback
and co-captain Ross Forman have
proved to be a deadly combination in
the freestyle sprints. In the 200 yard
freestyle event, Lawlor and Hal Catlin

 

Grapplers plagued by lack of depth

Depth, or rather the lack of it,
may be the key to this year’s varsity
wrestling team. A bumper crop of
outstanding freshman have come up
to compete for varsity roles, but they
only just fill some gaping holes made
by graduation in a squad that was
thin last year,

Again this season, the Generals
can count on several stellar per-
formers. Co-captains Razz Rasberry
at 130 and Jay Clarke at 167 are the
most dependable wrestlers around.
Then there’s hulking Dan Webster at

 

Booters Suffer
Losing Season

Although Washington and Lee's
soccer team suffered its first losing
season since 1961, Coach Joe Lyles
looks optimistically to the future.

Coach Lyles expects soccer to re-
sume its winning ways next year
under newly-elected captains Doug
Clarke, a rising senior fullback from
Houston, Tex., and lineman John
Yow, a senior from Marietta, Ga.

Coach Lyles says lack of depth was
a major factor in the Generals’ 3-5-1
season just completed. This, together
with the midseason loss of co-captain
and all-state forward Scott Fechnay
with a case of pneumonia, and a lack
of young talent hurt the squad's per-
formance.

177 who nearly made a legend out of
himself last year as a_ freshman.
Other grapplers back from last year’s
varsity are Dave Higgins and Charlie
Ross at 160 and Jack Ross and Brent
Hankins at 152. One of the biggest
mysteries is the heavyweight slot
where Waugh Crigler wrestled last
year. A bad shoulder has made
Waugh’'s situation uncertain.

To fill the gaping holes left in the
lower weights, Coach Miller is de-
pending on several freshmen. Buzz
White at 123 and Steve Ory at 116
are set. The big fights will shape up
for berths at 137 and 145, Sopho-
mores Wes Pullman, Dee Galanides
and Bruce Hankins are vying for the
former, while Bill West, John Clore,
and Roy Carlton aim for 145, Han-
kins and West look like the best bets.

Should injuries hit as hard as last
year, the Blue will find themselves in
deep trouble. Clark Carter is varsity
quality and could break in at 167 or
177. Jim Hooker, a freshman, may
claim the heavyweight slot, but other
than that the Generals are paper
thin.

with Jeff Grossman and Roger Martin
will provide more than adequate
depth. In distance freestyle events
David Kympton and Lawlor will both
score well.

Kympton and Lawlor are also the
two leading candidates at the moment
for the 200 yard butterfly event. In
the backstroke, perhaps co-captain
Billy Ball’s strongest stroke, Ball will
be supported by Hal Catlin and Bill
Kimmel. The breastroke is still a
major question mark. Freshman Kline
Stuart is a strong swimmer in this
category with support from Joe
Philips and Scot McElroy. Both Ball
and Lawlor are proficient at this
stroke but they are more valuable
elsewhere.

Leading the Generals’ diving attack
will be sophomore Mike Carrere with
several candidates still battling it out
for the second diving position.

The tentative addition of West Vir-
ginia University and Penn State will
add a bit of glamour to the natators’
schedule. The Generals barely beat
West Virginia last year in Lexington
in what was one of the most exciting
swimming meets of the year.

Besides Lawlor and Stuart there are

many strong swimmers among the
freshmen that will add considerable
depth to the overall attack. They in-
clude Rick Sands in the freestyle,
Bert Meem in the freestyle and but-
terfly, Withers Davis, and Charles
Comly.

By ROY CARLTON

It’s only six more days till the
Generals begin their 1968-69 basket-
ball season, and at this point, despite
the roughest schedule since major
college status, they look like they're
headed toward another winning year.
Monday night, Randolph-Macon
comes to old Doremus to initiate
things, but don’t expect any cake-
walk. W&L has never beaten the
Yellow Jackets in basketball, not
even in the last two years. R-MC
took two from the Blue a couple of
seasons ago, and avoided a match-up
last year when Lycoming belted the
Generals in the Randolph-Macon
tournament.

Coach Canfield’s squad has good
prospects of changing all that this
year, though. On the plus side for the
Blue is a twenty-three game home
winning streak, and a veteran squad
loaded with promising rookies. The
Generals will probably start with
All-Staters Mike Neer and Mel Cart-

«wright at center and forward re-
spectively. Last year’s “sixth starter,”
Stu Fauber, will move into the other
forward slot with Norwood Morrison
and Charlie Stone at the guards. Cap-
tain Earl Edwards will alternate with
Neer.

The Yellow Jackets can be counted
on to pit another fine team against
the Generals when the two collide
next week. Randy-Mac was very
tough last year and this season they
return with five lettermen from last
year and a couple talented freshmen
to add some depth. Their field gen-
eral, Darrell Morris, is a senior guard
who averaged 16.2 points per game
at that position in the last campaign.
Bolstering him are forwards Charlie
Weston, 6-5, and Craig Barney, 6-6.
Their combined height may be able
to cause some trouble for the Blue
whose tallest forward is Cartwright
at 6-5,

Other returnees are sophomores
Dale Kurowsky and Jim Phelps. Those
five will probably be the nucleus of
the Yellow Jacket squad. But R-MC
has a couple of very talented fresh-
men on the varsity in the persons
of Floyd Wingfield and Frank Farren.
It's to be expected, though, that as
freshmen, they won't be too effective
until later in the season.

Not that that’s a Godsend for the

Blue either. The same thing applies
to W&L, which is carrying five fresh-
men on the varsity at present. They
seem to be progressing very well,
however, as evidenced by last week’s
scrimmage against Bluefield (W.Va.)
State. W&L’s five freshmen; Robbie
Faust, Dave Stone, John Glace, Scott
Wood and Mike Daniel; went in
against Bluefield’s second string in a
“third” half. Their rout of the visitors
was so complete that Bluefield fin-
ally had to send in its first string to
even things up.

Last Thursday's scrimmage was cer-
tainly a boost for the roundballers.
Bluefield is supposed to have a really
fine team this year, but the Generals
had things completely their way.
Mike Neer rebounded well, and the

ball inside to Cartwright. One thing
the Blue needed last year and will
need even more this years is outside
shooting. The loss of Mal Wesselink,
6-7, removes a good deal of talent
from under the boards, and the only
way it can be compensated is by hit-

ting more often from the outside.
This was perhaps the most encourag-
ing thing about the Bluefield scrim-
mage. Morrison, Charlie Stone, and
Bill Rhyne were all superb on the
long shots as well as working the ball
around. If these three can continue
to give comparable performances,
then the Generals may finally have
the more balanced offense they've
been needing.

WAL appears to be ready for the
Yellow Jackets come Monday night.
But Randy-Mac is always ready for
the Generals. It's about time they
were put in their place, and_ this
year’s Blue may just do the trick.

  

It should be a game well worth
watching.

facilities, such as placement offices,
to aid the distribution of the ques-
tionnaires. Moreover, Compujob_ is
taking every precaution not to over-
look small colleges.

In the past great cost has tended
to limit industry in sending recruit-
ing representatives to many small
colleges where students urgently need
the wide exposure Compujob now
offers.

Questionnaires are located on the
WAL campus in the various academic
buildings, the Library, and the Co-op.
Compujob's on-campus representative
is senior Jeff Wexler, who has ad-
ditional questionnaires.

In its files Compujob already has
information regarding about 50 per
cent of those graduating students who
plan to enter the labor market in
1969. The company hopes to signi-
ficantly increase this figure by the
end of the year.

In its efforts to reach students and
make them aware of its operations,
Compujob has enlisted the aid of
collegiate newspapers and other pub-
lications both on campuses already in
the program and on campuses not
yet using Compujob. Through this
publicity Compujob hopes that in-
terested students will participate in the
business.

system could be clarified, but that
there is a distinct difference between
an enforceable set of regulations and
the concept of personal honor. He
cited several cases last spring where
the different professors in the mathe-
matics department were applying dif-
ferent criterions to the honor system,
and the EC had discussed the prob-
lem with them to devise a consistent
application of the honor system in
that department. He felt that the
honor system should not evoke into
a set of enforceable rules.

Another problem discussed was the

Law School Dean Roy L. Stein-

ties in Tucker Hall have become inl

however, that some of the funds

of a
he had

legal aspect
violator after
guilty and before a
trial. The EC now
person as guilty and forbids him to
go to classes. Passavant said that this
was based entirely upon precedent.
Many felt that as soon as a student
opted for a public hearing he should
be considered innocent and be al-
lowed to go to classes until he is
tried again.

The questions involved in the un-
authorized search of a student's pri-
vate room were also raised. It was
noted that in cases of possession of
illegal drugs, the University had
searched without either warrant or
the permission of the student involv-
ed. Passavant stated that the EC “has
never hesitated in the past” to search

been found
public

ja student’s room seeking evidence for

an honor violation. The participants
in the discussion felt that what was
needed was a student civil-liberties
code.

Passavant also urged that due to
the manpower shortage and the
amount of work that the EC must
do limits the EC’s ability to hold
lengthy independent investigations.
He said that he would be very will-
ing to form a committee made up
of one EC member and _ interested
students to investigate a given prob-
lem and make a report back to the
EC.

The EC was also severly critized
for its vote on the resolution not to
compile a list of those women in Lex-
ington who were willing to house
Negro girls.

meetings. If he controls discussion,
he appears to be censoring it.

With all this, did the Bitch-In ac-
complish anything? It certainly un-
covered some sore spots, like the
E.C.’s apparently unlimited right to
search any student’s private belong-
ings at any time. It also made pos-
sible some clarification in E.C. pro-
cedure.

Mostly, though, the Bitch-In de-
monstrated a failure. The E.C. tried
to use it as a dramatic device, a
stunt, an eye-catching device to en-
courage activity. All it dramatized
was something so dull and ordinary
that we all know it: student bodies
get the leaders they deserve, and we
have ours.

None of the matters brought up
last night would be allowed to exist
even briefly if we cared enough to
notice them. The E.C. would be
anxious to explain itself if people
showed they listen. As it is, some
good people on the E.C. confront
some issues in the face of our apathy,
the real issue. We always knew that.

Proof of the desperation over this
situation surfaced when a participant
suggested there might be more ses-
sions, even bi-monthly ones, a sort
of Son of Bitch-In. Groans filled the
echoing, nearly-empty auditorium.
This sort of thing may begin to have
an effect on Passavant, who has been
trying valiantly to cause some mo-
mentum among students.

If a Bitch-In is not ideal, what are
the alternatives? The first thing must

be to recognize that the lanes of
communication are, not closed, but
unused. We have no right to complain
about the E.C. without complaining
first to it. One-time talking won't
work, cither. Last night Passavant
almost literally begged students in-
terested in specific issues to work
on them with the E.C. The same
thing holds true during elections;
after all, we choose these people.

Direct questions help. If asked
through the Ring-tum Phi, they might
receive direct answers even without
a Bitch-In. Without any questions at
all, the E.C, will do what it wants.
The Bitch-In demonstrated how much
of a vacuum does surround the E.C.
If the meeting has serious flaws in
itself, it still points out whose effort
is needed to accomplish what we
want: our own,

 

“Bourbonism to Byrd”

Dr. Moger discusses the legacy of
poverty left by the Civil War and
its influence upon Virginia politics
into the twentieth century. The book
reviews the economic policies of pro-
gressive and conservative leaders of
the Old Dominion.

Professor Moger began teaching at
Washington and Lee in 1929. He re-
ceived his undergraduate degree from
Randolph-Macon College and his
Ph.D. from Columbia University.
Among the courses he teaches are
“The New South” and “The United
States since 1900.”
