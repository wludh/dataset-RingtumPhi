Lee Students Study
Vast Subject Sphere

Robert E. Lee research grants have
been given to 42 students this year.
The grants-in-aid are awarded to stu-
dents who then work on a given
project under the supervision and
guidance of a member of the faculty.

These research projects are unique
to a great degree in that they are
often topics on the graduate level.
The projects may originate with the
student or with a faculty member
who wants a student assistant to help
in one of his research undertakings.

Ihe program was begun in 1960
through a gift of more than $250,000
from the late Dr. Gustavus Benz
Capito of Charleston, W. Va. Below

Alumnus Provides Income for WLUR

A freak broadcast signal that per-
mits an alumnus in Lynchburg to
hear Washington and Lee University’s
low power FM educational radio sta-
tion has been translated into an an-
nual gift of some $2,700 for support |
of the station's activities.

Richard E. Gooch, a 1930 gradu-
ate of the university and a former
Lynchburg radio broadcasting ex-
ecutive, has established an endow-
ment which will provide an annual
income of approximately $2,700 to
be applied to operating expenses and
equipment purchase for WLUR-FM.

A laboratory of the Department of
Journalism and Communications,
WLUR-FM broadcasts nightly except
Saturdays from 7 to 11 p.m. and on
Saturdays from 1 to 9 p.m. It began
operation in February, 1967.

Gooch says that WLUR’s signal
comes to his Lynchburg home “clear

Fall Production
Opens At Briar

Paint and Patches, the student
dramatic organization at Sweet Briar,
has announced that this year's fall
production will be Bertold Brecht’s
“The Good Woman of Setzuan.”

The play will be presented today
and tomorrow at 8:30 p.m. in Bab-
cock Auditorium. Immediately fol-

 

lowing the production there will be
a coffee hour during which the audi-
ence will have a chance to meet the!
director, Richard Busch, the designer, |
Dennis Dougherty, and the cast.

The Brechtian play is essentially a
modern parable, Set in the China of |
1940, “The Good Woman of Setzuan”
tells the story of Shen Te, a prostitute |
who befriends three gods and ends
their search for a good and happy
individual. Rewarded with enough

money to buy a tobacco store, she
must assume the identity of a hard-|
ened businessman to prevent her!

parasitic relatives from exploiting her
goodness. Another treat is Shen Te’'s
lover, whose only concern is flying

Alumnus

John W. Warner,
Washington, D. C., law firm of Hogan
and Hartson, has been elected to
membership on the Board of Trustees
of Washington and Lee University, it
was announced today by Dr. Huston
St. Clair, rector of the board.

Warner, 41, is a 1949 graduate of
WAL with a B.S. degree in physics-
engineering. He received his LL.B.
degree from the University of Vir-
ginia Law School in 1953.

Law Career Begun As Clerk

The University’s new trustee was
admitted to the Bar of the District
of Columbia in 1953, serving first
as law clerk to the Honorable E.
Barrett Prettyman, former chief judge
of the United States Circuit Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit, and then joining the law firm
of McKenny, Flanery and Craighill.

From 1955 to 1960, Warner was
an assistant U. S. Attorney for the
District of Columbia, serving in all
trial and appellate divisions of the
U. S. Attorney's Office, and conclud-

a partner in the

——*ing with two years in the Criminal

Division trial staff for the WU. S.
District Court.

Later in 1960, Warner joined
Hogan and Hartson as an associate
in the firm's banking-corporate de- |
partment. He became a general part-|
ner in 1964,

Throughout his legal career, Warn-
er has displayed active concern for
the plight of indigent criminal de-

fendants. During each year of private

sel for defendants unable
private counsel. During the civil dis-
orders occurring in the nation’s capi-
tal in April, 1968, Warner was among
attorneys who volunteered to assist
District of Columbia courts with the
| overload of criminal cases.

1960, Warner established the
“Prettyman Internship Program” at
Georgetown University, a pilot pro-
ject to provide qualified counsel for
indigent criminal defendants. Each
| year, six honor graduates from lead-
ing law schools were selected for a

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

An Interview With President Huntley

(Editor’s note: The following contains
pertinant excerpts from a conversation with
President Huntley conducted this past
Tuesday night. The staff of the Friday
Ring-tum Phi wishes to thank President
Huntley for his time and patience so that
this interview could be made possible.)

Five-Day Plan

Ring-tum Phi; We've heard that one of the
critics of the Five-Day Plan, Mike Nation,
has said that the Lynchburg Plan would re-
inforce student apathy prevalent here. This
apathy has been subject to some criticism for
some time. And although it does appear that
the situation is improving, do you feel that
the Lynchburg Plan would reinforce the
apathetic attitude, if you feel that one exists?

President Huntley: I don’t see any particular
reason why a class scheduling plan would have
much effect on apathy one way or the other.
I suppose it’s possible that any Five-Day Plan
would seem to some to de-emphasize the re-
sponsibility of students on the campus. To
that extent, if students take it in that light,
then I suppose I might. I hope that’s not the
way it’s intended. I know that the faculty
members that favor it don’t look at it that

way.

I would judge that there are two apparent
reasons why the faculty favors the plan. The
first and obvious one is the convenience of
having a long weekend. People also feel that
for some students and some faculty members
a more condensed class schedule would permit

outside of social

time for activities

activities on Saturday. Whether it would work

some

that way or not, I don’t know.

Those that oppose the five day week feel
that Friday will become Saturday; if we're
on a Five-Day Week, we'll then be on a four-
day week. But, I don’t believe that will hap-
pen.

R-t Phi: What are the chances that the faculty
will act on Monday to approve any Five-Day

Plan?

Huntley: I really don’t know. The faculty
here is composed of men who have many
different habits of thoughts, as they should.
Not all of them have been in a position to
consider the issue until it is upon them. It’s
hard to predict.

R-t Phi: If the faculty should approve a Five-
Day Plan, do you think we would have the
plan in effect next semester?

Huntley: They'd have to vote on that, too
but I think that it would be a good possibility.

Apathy

R-t Phi: Ac the beginning of the interview,
we hit on the subject of student apathy.
What are your thoughts on this? What do
you think it’s sources are; do you think it’s
a trait common to all campuses; and do you

see any cure-all for it?

Huntley: I don’t know what it’s causes are. I
suspect it is common to all campuses. It pro-
duces a division within the student body be-

tween the students who are hyper-active, and

 

 

om couldn't cate less le would
end in the position or responsibility
ie sttidents wit OoVver-active thyroids ar
ething lt sPriiic to fi that iti Wat a little

different when I was a student. The young
generation is more introspective than it once
was. They also seem to lack a sense of humor;
by that I mean they don’t have the ability to
laugh at themselves with wry detachment.

It could be that we’re experiencing the
effects of a public and private educational
system, that puts young men only with their
own age groups. I don’t know what one does
about that—TI think that is a generation gap
that produces isolation of the individual from
society. Even I am more isolated from 40 year
olds than I used to be. I really don’t know
what the answer is.

Smaller Classes

R-t Phi: What can be done to get the student
more involved in the classroom here to avoid
this apathy?

Huntley: I think that we need to look at
continuously the advantage of our smallness.

 

I suspect that many faculty members do try to
involve the students in their material in every

dental to other plans. We need first to de-
what academic facilities we need.
Incident to that decision, a projection would
need to be made of the size of the student
body over the next ten years. A tentative
master plan as to academic construction will
hopefully be with us before this school year
is out. Then, it will be possible to make a
decision as to where a set of dorms could be
located.

termine

I think that we will have additional upper-
class housing. I hope that we will have them
soon. I think that probably the first dorms
will be built without the decision having been
made as to how many will ultimately be
constructed,

As to what kind of dorms they will be, I
don’t know. I do know that they will be built
as an alternative to living in apartments or
single rooms in town. I’m not really sure
what that means, though. Our goal would not
be to duplicate what is already offered a stu-
dent in town, but to offer an additional al-
ternative to it. I don’t know what's implied
in all that-——whether it means that unlimited
restrictions of female visitation and drinking
should be allowed, or whether it means that
students themselves in each unit should de-
termine that. I’m not sure. I’m sure it would
mean considerably fewer restrictions than one
now has in the dormitories. We certainly don’t
want to offer just a better appointed apart-
ment. I don’t believe that penning up all the
students in dormitories is ncessarily going to
produce a better academic climate.

One of the purposes in having the dormi-
tories would be to offer an alternative to
fraternity social life, which wouldn’t neces-
sasarily mean that you'd have to choose one
or the other. I don’t think that the school
either could or should attempt to create a
school-run fraternity system. The school
should take affirmative steps to reduce a fra-

 

way that 1s possibl . Administratively we

should try to provide them with more

Curriculum

R-t Phi: As for academics, could we interpret
the effort on the part of the Curriculum Com.
mittee to come up with a new alteration in
the curriculum as a change of philosophy in
education?

Huntley: I think that you could take it as
an effort on the faculty’s part to take ad-
vantage of the small nature of the school—
the good student-faculty ratio—to adopt pro-
grams that are well suited to our situation.
I think you should be cautious not to assume
that there is some highly efficient scheme,
though. The Committee is operating on the
philosophy that they themselves have de-
veloped. They are trying to ensure that the
curriculum we offer is the best possible one
we can offer in our circumstances. It will tend
to offer as diverse a program as we can afford.

Board of Trustees

R-t Phi: In last Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi, an
editorial called for a student to sit on the
Board of Trustees as a representative of the
student body. What are your feelings on
this?

Huntley: I think that it’s better not to con-
sult them at all if you're trying to fool them
into thinking that you're consulting them.
But I’m inclined to think that student mem-
bership on the Board would not be a good
idea. I think you would inhibit the Board
of Trustees, rather than nimble their deci-
sions. I also think

would be true of

faculty membership on the Board.

Gap Lies Between Students and EC

According to many experts, one of the
reasons for the recent unrest at colleges and
universities throughout the country has been
the lack of communication between students
and administration.

The students see the administrations and
their spokesmen, the Presidents of the uni-
versities, as solely interested in raising funds
for the schools. The students also contend
that no one in the administration is willing to
take time out to hear their demands, suggest-
ions and gripes. Thus, when the students
cannot be heard through the proper channels,
they must resort to demonstrations, which
may often get out of hand.

As evidenced by today’s interview with
President Robert Huntley, this problem does
not exist at Washington and Lee to as great
an extent as it may at other universities. The
administration is willing to talk with the stu-
dents. Indeed, the administration often goes
out of its way to talk to students. Although
action is not taken on a lot of issues the stu-
dents bring up, there is a direct line of com-
munication between the two factions.

Where a direct line of communication is
lacking here is not between the students and
administration, but between the students and
their Executive Committee. The student body
at W&L has always complained about the pro-
cedings of the EC. The students have charged
the EC with dealing clandestinely in all mat-
ters, especially those concerning the honor
system.

If students have been complaining why
have they not gone directly to the EC and
given constructive criticism and logical solu-
tions to their gripes? The excuse used most
often is the EC won’t listen to them.

This may have been the situation in the
past, but this year Student Body president
Jay Passavant is trying to correct what has
turned into widespread apathy on the part
of the students because of the fear and frustra-
tion of not being heard. One of his solutions,
which does not claim to be a panacea, is the
“Bitch-In” scheduled for Monday night in
duPont Hall.

This is a chance for students to air in the
open their complaints and gripes concerning
the EC or any other segment of the Univer-
sity. At the same time it is an opportunity for
students to present constructive suggestions.
All too often we, as students, are prone to
complaining about things without bothering
to resolve solutions for them.

The EC intends to listen to all contribu-
tions of students. No members of the faculty
or administration will be recognized to speak.
This is the time for students to again become
part of their government and bridge the gap
which has arisen between these two groups.
For anyone who does not attend the “Bitch-
In” without a valid excuse and still complains
about the decisions of the EC, all we can say

 

is, “You had your chance to be heard.”

Publications Board Statement

In view of the editorial entitled, “Quo
vadit honor,” published in the Tuesday, No-
vember 19, 1968 Ring-tum Phi, the Publica-
tions Board feels that it is necessary to issue
a statement.

As the editorial states, the Publications
Board met on Tuesday, November 4, 1968
to consider what action, if any, to take con-
cerning a charge of alleged plagiarism in an
editorial written by Neil Kessler in the October
25, 1968 edition of the Friday Ring-tum
Phi. During the meeting, by unanimous con-
sent, it was “agreed that the proceedings of
the meeting would be kept secret”’ (accord-
ing to Secretary Larry Honig’s minutes). This
decision was reached on the basis of precedent
involving censorship rulings by the Publica-
tions Board. It is regrettable that this con-
fidence has been violated by Mr. Honig.
Since this information has been revealed in
part, the Publications Board has voted to re-
lease a more complete account of the meet-
ing in order to protect our integrity and cor-
rect a misrepresentation of the facts. It is
true that, as Mr. Honig says, “the Publica-
tions Board failed to remove Mr. Kessler as
editor.” It is mot true, as Mr. Honig implies
by omission, that the Publications Board did
nothing. The board passed the following two
motions of censure:

“The Publications Board finds that Mr.
Kessler has acted unethically.”

“The Publications Board finds that its con-
fidence in Mr. Kessler’s judgment has been
shaken, and asks him to continue as Editor-
in-Chief of The Friday Ring-tum Phi, but
that the editorship is provisional until the

end of the first semester, subject to review
by the Board.”

Dean Edward C. Atwood was informed of
these two motions. The board rejected a mo-
tion that Mr. Kessler be removed as editor.

Mr. Honig has also implied that Mr.
Kessler lied during the course of his testimony
before the Publications Board. In view of the
fact that no officially authorized transcript of
that testimony exists, and that there are vary-
ing opinions among the board members con-
cerning that testimony, it is difficult to see
how Mr. Honig can make such a statement

of fact.
oo.

In a meeting of the Publications Board on
Thursday, November 21, 1968, the board
censured Mr. Honig and voted to make pub-
lic this censure, which reads,

“Mr. Honig has published charges against
Mr. Kessler which were previously brought
before the proper governing bodies and
considered by those bodies in the strictest
confidence. Moreover, by omission of the
above mentioned details, he has misrepre-
sented these facts. Mr. Honig has charged
that Mr. Kessler ‘changed his testimony’
before the Publications Board, of which
charge he had previously been acquitted by
due process. In making these charges, Mr.
Honig has been guilty of irresponsible and
unethical journalism. The Publications
Board condemns his actions and warns Mr.
Honig against further irresponsible acts.”

A Look In Review of Fall Sports

With The Intramurals

Although Thursday was to be a
conclusive day in intramurals, the
only conclusions reached were in|

swimming.

In football the long delayed champ-
ionship was further postponed, as Phi
Delta Theta maintaned their jinx over
Phi Gamma Delta. The Phi Gams,
needing only one more win to
the crown, fell to a second half
claught of Phi Delt scores, 13-12.

Phi Gam jumped off to a 6-0 lead
with a touchdown on their first
offensive series. A bomb to Tom
Robinson from Gil Turner was fol-
lowed by a blocked extra point at-
tempt. This was all of the first half
scoring, but the Phi Delta came back
strong at the beginning of the second
period.

Sparked by the passing of Casey
Jones to receivers Gary Murphy and
Clint Murchison, The winners scored
two quick ones, both set up on inter-

ice
on-

 

ceptions. The deciding factor turned
out to be a conversion by Dave Huff-|
man of the Phi Delts. It was decisive |
because the Fijis moved to a_ last]
second tally, again on a long pass
from Turner to Robinson. With time |
