Rare Churchill Copies

Lin Hartin happened upon a rather
amazing find in the library basement)

 

the other day.
Hartin, a senior from Columbus, |
Ga., was brousing in the stacks when |

he ran across autographed copies of |
both volumes of “Lord Randolph
Chuchill.” They were autographed by
the author, Winston Spencer Churc-
hill, and in addition there was a
letter pasted into the front cover
of Vol. 1 to Mrs. John W. Davis, |
who had apparently sent the books

to Churchill to be authographed. The
University came into the possession
of these and other books in 1956
when the library of John W. Davis,
a W&L alumnus and Democratic
candidate for President in 1928, was
bequeathed to W&L.

The letter, dated June 6, 1920, is
written on Admiralty stationery and

says that Churchill is “much obliged
.for your kind letter and pleased

to think that my inscription should

add to your interest in my book.”

Churchill wrote the book lagely to

other collectors’ items the school

some of these rare and valuable

works are being sorted and catalogued
in hopes of such a special room.

Churchill's two-volume work was
generally well-accepted by the critics
and by the reading public. Several
noted the excellent description it con-
tained of the inner workings of
British politics of the late 19th Cen-
tury, and most lauded its amazingly
objective portrait of Lord Randolph,
considering his relationship with the
author.

thing of a homecoming for UNC's
President Friday, since he is a native
of nearby Raphine.

Dr. Friday grew up in Dallas, N.C.,
where his father was a textile ma-
| chinery manufacturer, attended Wake
Forest for a year, then entered North
Carolina State, where he was gradu-
ated in textile engineering in 1941,

After World War II naval service,
President Friday received his law de-
gree from UNC in Chapel Hill. He
then served as assistant dean of stu-
dents there and in 1951 became ad-
ministrative assistant to President
Gordon Gray of the consolidated Uni-
| versity of North Carolina, which in-
| cludes the campuses at Chapel Hill,
Raleigh, Greensboro and Charlotte.

He subsequently became the secre-
tary of the consolidated university
and was named its president in 1956.
| Dr. Friday served as chairman of
the President's Task Force on Educa-
tion, the President's Commission on
White House Fellows, and as a di-
rector of the American Council of
Education. A member of the board
of visitors of Davidson College, he is
a former chairman of the Southern
Regional Education Board and a
member of both the Carnegie Found-
| ation for the Advancement of Teach-
ing and the Carnegie Commission on
the Future of Higher Education. He
currently serves on the board of The
Urban Institute.

After the inauguration there will
be a luncheon for the delegates at
1:15 p.m. in Evans Dining Hall. The
Inaugural Committee was appointed
by President Huntley and has planned
the program. It is composed of Leon

We Will Cooperate iii

The Ring-tum Phi, as an important segment of Washing-
ton and Lee University, is proud of the relationship we have
with all of the business concerns in the Lexington area. We
attempt to keep the student body informed about new busi-
nesses opening up in this area and we cooperate with them
in giving them publicity for any special events they sponsor.
In return, these businesses are willing to lend students certain
things ranging from staples to cars and trucks. Whenever this
relationship is severed, we feel there is a need to restate our
position. Certain events of Friday, September 20, have brought
us to this conclusion.

 

The above events centered about the Ring-tum Phi’s using
a metal cutter located at the Lexington News-Gazette Com-
mercial Printing Department. The only reason we wanted to
use someone else’s cutter was that ours, which was on order,
had not arrived. When we asked the printing firm for as-
sistance, the business manager rejected our request.

We realize if all the employees had been busy at the time,
our matter would not have taken precedence over all others
(even though this simple, but necessary, task would have taken
less than five minutes). But not all of the employees were
occupied, What was implied in the business manager’s argu-
ment was that the Ring-tum Phi should be totally responsible
for its operations since we now own a photo-lathe machine
(see picture on page 1), thus taking revenue from the News-
Gazette printing department whose equipment we had used
in the past.

We agree with the manager's argument wholeheartedly,
and we are trying to become more independent. However,
when we have problems we would like to turn toward the print-
ing department for help, in the same way it HAS AND
WILL CONTINUE TO TURN TOWARD Washington and
Lee for assistance.

It is true that the Ring-tum Phi took away a substantial
amount of business from the commercial printing department.
However, we did this only because we were able to buy the
photo-lathe machine for less money than we paid the print-
ing department last year.

In the final analysis, it is important to understand that
the Ring-tum Phi is a non-profit newspaper supported by stu-
dent fees, subscriptions and advertising. Although its pur-
poses are purely educational, it can also act in the capacity
of a public servant. The Ring-tum Phi is not in competition
with any other publication anywhere, nor do we want to be.
We are here to serve the student body and the community
in any way possible. We are willing to cooperate if we receive a
certain amount of cooperation in return.

What Could It Do?

bridge County. This school is an
integral part of the community as
an employer and consumer. In turn,
fraternities are an integral part of
WAL life and if WAL is to partici-
pate in the community in any
meaingful way then it is up to the
fraternities to take the first largest

This past week the Interfraternity
Council served as overseer for rush
week, making the preparations, super-
vising, and in the end fining various
fraternities almost $1,000 for rush

violations. Now that over 80 percent
of the freshmen have accepted bids,
the IFC, if it follows the pattern
of previous judicial boards, will lapse
into the routine of monotonous and
insignificant Monday night meetings.

The regular functions that IFC
performs for the fraternity system
will be taken care of—pledging and
depledging, scheduling of parties, and
the annual heart fund drive. In addi-
tion, the IFC treasury will give $2,500
to Contact and will also partially
subsidize the living expenses of an
exchange student. And, although
these are worthwhile endeavors, they
are also typical of the involvement of
the IFC in campus activities. That is,
the IFC is merely a financial patron,
and it is this fact of life at WAL that

is the cause of most criticism that is|

heaped upon fraternities

There is on this campus a gen-
eral lack of social awareness. Some
of faculty members and students
take an active part in community
action programs, yet the over-
whelming majority of both groups
tend to isolate themselves from
problems of Lexington and Rock-

 

step.

The IFC represents a larger num-
ber of students than any other organi-
zation on campus and because of this,
it has the responsibility to do more
than make a financial contribution to
campus and community activities. Al
WAL, a great deal of time has been
spent to develop intellectually strong
and socially oriented students, but
very little effort has been

Chicago: A Daley Affair

By DANNY LEONARD delegates going into the Humphrey
camp. By postponing endorsement of
a candidate until Wednesday, Daley
caused uncalled for speculation about
the possible candidacy of Ted Ken-
nedy, whom he never had any inten-
tion of backing. Wednesday morning
Daley came out for Humphrey along
with most of the Illinois delegation—
and the specualtion was ended and
the Democrats had a candidate.

For the past three weeks, I have
heard the Democratic National Con-
vention called a little bit of every-
thing from “A Great Victory for
Hubert” to “A National Embarrass-
ment.” I would like to add to the
long list of titles one that I deem
very appropriate: “The Daley Affair.”
It is an appropriate title, I think, for
two reasons:

(1) It was the strategy of Mayor
Richard J. Daley that won the con-
vention for Humphrey.

(2) It was the strategy of Mayor
Richard J. Daley that resulted in
blood in the streets and victory for
the far left.

Let me explain. Humphrey's strat-
egy for winning the nomination de-
pended on two key figures: Richard
M. Nixon and Richard J. Daley. It
was a strategy based on the candidacy
of Nixon and the fiction of Daley's
“non-commitment.” The plan was to
woo and win the conservative South,
even if it meant angering the liberal,
industrial North, Strategists figured
that with Nixon as the only other
choice, the disgrunted liberals would
nonetheless have to fall into the
Humphrey camp.

The choice of Senator Muskie as
his running mate was also used by
Humphrey to calm the liberals. The
non-commitment front of Daley was
used to make the convention appear
open. In a similar attempt to fool
the delegates and the public into
believing that Chicago was an open
convention, Humphrey strategists told
the press that more than 1,000 dele-

Daley's charade of “non-com-
mitment” was designed to give the
impression that the Democratic Na-
tional Convention was an “open”
convention, Daley’s endorsement of
Humprey was timed to set the ball
rolling toward nomination, Just
like a Broadway play, the plot—
the strategy—was well thought out
and well timed; amateur acting
may prove to be the downfall of
“The Daley Affair” in November.

Mayor Daley proved to be a ham,
not only inside the convention hall,
but in the streets of Chicago as well.
Had he not been so willing and so
insistent on proving to America that
Chicago is Daley’s town, that mess
that we all witnessed in the streets
of Chicago could have been avoided.
Daley termed them as hard-core com-
munists that had to be put down
ruthlessly. Make no mistake about
ii—those brutal attacks were not the
fault of the police force; they were
only under orders. They were the
fault of the one man responsible for
giving those orders: Richard J. Daley.
The police do not have the back-
ground, the education, and the under-
standing to cope with a beard spit-
ting in their faces. But it seems the
Mayor of the City of Chicago would!

Sure, there probably were some
hard-core communists leading that
group. But for the most part, that
crowd of some 4,000 young people
was a peace-loving crowd with only
one thing in mind: a peace plank on
Vietnam. If they had been allowed
to say what they had on their minds,
the far-left wingers would have had
little luck gaining support for their
programs to destroy this democracy,
If those young people had only been
allowed their dignity, they would have
letf Chicago quietly, their wants ap-
peased, and feeling that maybe even
Youth can have a say about what
goes on in this, the American De-
mocracy. Instead of handling them
with the care they deserved, Mayor
Daley ordered the police to use what-
ever force was necessary to subdue
them,

 

Who knows now in which camp
these young people will settle? I'm
quite sure of one thing—they won't
feel at home in the U. S, as long
as they know their dissenting voice

Backroads To The Hill

By BOB BAROODY

| have decided that Rosemary's
baby grew up into that cinematic
product of evil known on marquees
throughout the nation as Lee Marvin.
In mocking our straight-jacket men-
tality Marvin hits below the belt
and gets away with it; so does “Rose-
mary’s Baby.”

“Rosemary's Baby” (from the novel
by Ira Levin) is the story of an
actor’s wife who is delivered to Satan
by her husband and a congenial band
of witches so that she might have
a child by the arch fiend. Director
Roman Polonski uses this plot only
as the vehicle for cutting to shreds
his favorite whipping boy: the soph-
isticated, urbane mentality that smoth-
ers random imagination and stub-
bornly refuses to acknowledge the
possible existence of witches, war-
locks, the Devil, and, by extension,
a irrational God.

The Middle Class Devil

(save Rosemary) so that it is im-
poss.ble to identify them with ab-
solutes. Thus, there is not one char-
acter in the whole film who is
adequate as an evil being. Satan
for example, is no fallen angel; he

is such a thoroughly middle class
devil that rather than contribute to
the illegitimacy rate by choosing some
pure white virgin; he ravishes poor
Rosemary in a high-camp rape scene.
Rosemary herself, beautifully over-
done by Mia Farrow, is nevertheless
a highly synthetic little thing who
for a while evokes sympathy by
attempting to assert a sort of indi-
viduality. Her fear is compounded
because its source is not rooted in
any one individual (which would make
it easy to dispose of), but rather in
the very thought of a conspiracy.

Bittersweet End

Polonski creates suspense in this
situation by confusing us with rapid
jump cuts, obscure action, and in-
tensely detailed sets. To these techni-
cal aids he gleefully adds bits and
pieces of contemporary issues, such
as the God Is Dead theme, aimed at
derailing our cosmopolitan sense of
jreason and always keeping us off
| balance. The effect of the resolution
scene upon the evidence is similar
to that produced in a Marvin movie;
after drooling our way through ca-
tharsis our imaginations are reconciled
with the final action only because it
appears to be bittersweet reality. En-
lightenment costs more than a buck
and a half.

 

 

To the Editor:

Because of the recent E.C. deci-
sion on freshman and conventional
dress, the nature of WA&L’s dress code
needs to be brought into focus, Over
the years, the meaning of “conven-
tional” dress has undergone consid-
erable change. Twenty years ago,
vests were a required part of con-
ventional dress. Ten years ago,
trousers (as Opposed to slacks) were
not considered conventional. Four
years ago, blue and wheat jeans were
frowned upon. Perhaps, turtle neck
sweaters may replace the shirt and
tie as conventional,

Because of the rapidity of our
changing dress habits, the official
code of conventional dress has not

needs to be raised is the necessity
for a prescribed dress code at all.
In a liberal arts institution which
WAL claims to be, a student should
be free to grasp new ideas, new
approaches, and new philosophies. A
student should have the academic and
personal freedom to find himself, to
be his own man, to experiment, to
reach his own conclusions.

Thus, the idea of a preseribed code
of dress (that tells you what to wear
and what not to wear) is repugnant
to the concept of liberal education
(where a student learns what he
should wear and what he should
| belive). How can | be encouraged
to think for myself, to deal with real
problems, when | am forced to live
in an artificial world of “conventional
dress?”

Leslie was pleased with the running
of junior halfback Joe Dozier, Bucky
Cunningham’s continued display of
his pass-catching abilities (five for 45
yards), and the usual fine defensive
work of Wolf.

Dozier will get the starting nod
against Randolph-Macon. The full
extent of senior Luke Crosland’s knee
injury suffered against Guilford is not
known, but he definitely will not
dress for the Yellow Jackets.

“I’m not discouraged about our
offense,” Leslie said. “Tomlin basically
did a good job.” He and reserves
Chuck Kuhn and Jack Baizley all
shared the signal-calling against Guil-
ford and it’s likely this will continue
for awhile.

“They have a lot of experience in

An important change in the store
is that there is no longer a_ ladies’

Eaker Admonishes
Interfraternity Council
To Assume Responsibility

(Continued from Page 2)

I feel that the ideal project would
be a free school to which people in
the community could come in order
to continue their education or even
to begin it anew. Students and faculty
members could volunteer as instruc-
tors and administrators, and the fa
cilities of the University could be used
as classrooms. Courses in reading and
|writing could be given, well
instruction in other fields. This would
|serve the community and its people
jas well as giving the students an ex-
iperience in helping others.

This IFC could continue as in
the past and be merely and regula-
tory agency. or it could live up to
its responsibilities as the most pow-
erful organization on campus. By
becoming aware of the problems
that surround us the IFC can then
mobilize the resources, financial and
manpower, to do something about
those problems. If WAL is to turn
out interested and responsible citi-
zens, then the fraternities must lead
the way by becoming more than
just eating houses, Vraternities are
not the source of all evil, as some
people have claimed, but by the
same token, fraternities and the IFC
have failed to make truly valuable
contributions in the past. It should
be the common goal of each of
us to prevent this same failure in
the future.
