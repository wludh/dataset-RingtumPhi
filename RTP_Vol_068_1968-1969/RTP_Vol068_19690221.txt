Moger Made
Chairman
Of History

Dr. Allen W. Moger will become
head of W&L’s Department of His-
tory for the 1969-70 academic year
and will be succeeded by Dr. William
A. Jenks in September, 1970, was
announced by Dr. William) W. Pusey
Ill, Dean of the College.

Dr. Moger, a member of the uni-
versity’s history faculty for 39 years,
will succeed Dr. Ollinger Crenshaw,
who has been department head since
1962 and a teacher at Washington
and Lee for 42 years.

University policy requires depart-
ment head retirement at age 65, al-
though such professors may continue
to teach until age 70.

Dr. Crenshaw becomes 65 in May,
1969, and Dr. Moger will reach 65
in May, 1970, Both are expected to
continue to teach under the chair-
manship of Dr. Jenks, 51, an alumnus
of Washington and Lee who joined
its faculty in 1946,

Dr. Moger is currently acting head
of the department during a semester's
leave of absence by Dr. Crenshaw.
Dr. Jenks is expected to be on leave
one semester next year. Both leaves
are made possible through a special
grant form the Ford Foundation
designed to strengthen undergraduate
instruction in the humanities.

All three men are active historians
as well as teachers. Dr. Moger’s
highly-praised “Virginia: Bourbonism
to Byrd, 1870-1925" was published
by the University of Virginia Press

in December last year. Dr. Cren-
shaw’s history of Washington and
Lee from 1749 to 1930, entitled

“General Lee’s College,” will be pub-
lished by Random House in May. Dr.
jenks has written widely on Austrian
history, including “Vienna and the
Young Hitler,” published by Colum-
bia University Press in 1960, and
“Austria Under the Iron Ring, 1879-
1893,” published in 1965 by the Uni-
versity of Virginia Press.

Dr. Moger is a native of Nanse-
mond County, Va., and received his
B.A. degree from Randolph-Macon
College in 1927. He earned M.A. and
Ph.D. degrees at Columbia Univers-

ity in 1935 and 1940, He was pro-
moted to professor of history here
in 1951

Dr. Moger is chairman of the Unt-
versity’s Library Committee and its
Lecture Committee.

Dr. Jenks is a native of Jackson-
ville, Fla.. and graduated from Wash
ingion and Lee in 1939. He
earned graduate degrees at ¢ olumbia,
receiving his M.S. in 1940 and the
Ph.D. in 1949, He was promoted to
professor of history in 1956.

ing the quarterly magazine to fold,
at least for this year,

Kessler stated that only 150 sub

that “last year’s Collegian was in debt

Not A Hollow Change

If one set out to prophesy what the major
issue on this campus would be for the next
few weeks, he wouldn’t need a crystal ball.
An educated guess about the soon to be re-
leased Curriculum Committee’s proposal
would be sufficient. Mindful of the debates
that will inevitably ensue, we felt it timely
to evaluate educational philosophy, student
opinion, and the significance of the probable
direction of these proposals on the future of
our curriculum,

The great end of life

is not knowledge

but action.

—Thomas Henry Huxley,
Technical Education

Before we launch into a discussion of the
effect of the Committee’s probable objectives,
a re-assessment of our educational goals must
be taken. W&L must decide what it is at-
tempting to accomplish by enrolling students
for four years of higher learning. Is the Uni-
versity trying to fill students’ heads with
important facts, or is its intention to develop
the active minds of students? The latter goal
seems to be the more important to us. Anyone
can obtain facts by the mere reading of a text-
book but being able to work with facts re-
quires more than that. It requires an instructor
who places a demand on the student to relate
one idea to another in order to answer some
general question posed by the teacher.

At present, students here see little relevance
between the courses they take and society as
a whole. Our poll below satisfactorily indicates
that. If students see little relevance between
the knowledge that they are gaining and the
world about them, then our educational
philosophy must be at fault in some way.
We feel the fault lies with our present learn-
ing process, which is murky at best. Roughly,
the system works as follows: (1) students
obtain facts from different fields their first
two years; (2) when they embark upon their
major, they gain more detailed knowledge
about their particular field of interest; and
(3) they begin to relate their expanse of
knowledge to disciplinary questions their
senior year, primarily through seminar
courses.

We feel that under this system the student
loses interest in the course he is taking and
therefore retains little. The utopian program
of learning for a student who comes to W&L
should force the student to gain knowledge
for himself by presenting him with questions
and the tools with which to answer them. By
questioning him, giving him the tools to go
about finding the answers, the knowledge he
will gain from participating in his courses
will be valuable to him because he arrived at
the answers himself.

Certainly, the present process as described
above does not hold true in all cases; our
alternative may not be practical in all depart-
ments either. But, we think the latter system
wil be conducive to student involvement in
the classroom, and, hopefully, it will en-
courage more students to become involved in
the university community as well. Knowledge
without an active mind that creates with it is
worthless.

Many a dangerous temptation
comes to us in fine gay colours
that are but skin deep.
Mathew Henry,
Commentaries, Genesis, II

At this point, we jump from a philosophic
plane to a more realistic level—the issue of

curriculum change. In the poll taken last
Wednesday, a majority of the students indi-
cated that they favored some form of short
term curriculum. So do we. But we are hesitant
to interpret what their various reasons for pre-
ferring a short term are. If they favored the
two 12 week periods in the hope that their
work would be lightened, they may be badly
misled, for the work load for two 12 week
periods would almost definitely be greater.
If they voted “Yes” because they liked the
idea of a six week holiday, they would prob-
ably be disillusioned should the new system
ever be instituted. It would be encouraging
if the majority of them voted for the plan so
that they would have a six week period to
study independently an area of their own
interest. But, here again, we can only con-
jecture.

Whatever their reasons, it is fairly apparent
that students and faculty members (as shown
by the poll taken by the Tuesday Ring-tum
Phi) are in favor of the plan. We must be
careful, though, not to substitute form for
substance. The 12-6-12 plan is conducive to
the type of learning process we presented at
the opening of this editorial, for it could be
designed for a course group from which the
student can choose a topic to pursue during
his six week study period. The last 12 weeks
could be used to study different questions
undertaken by various students in a course
group. To set up a curriculum such as this
would take study by all the various depart-
ments in the college. Unfortunately, we fear
that many departments may shy away from
this approach, reverting to old curriculum
requirements compacted into two 12 week

 

A New Educational Experience

If dissatisfaction concerning a university’s
curriculum arises within the student body of
that university, what can be done to change
the situation? At the same time, what can
students do to shake traditional thinking about
university education and make learning a new
educational experience?

These questions are currently being answer-
ed by many colleges and universities across
the nation. The students of these schools,
with the aid of faculty, are setting up experi-
mental colleges in an effort to combat the
frustrations they encounter when they try to
gain reforms for curriculums. The primary
aims of the Experimental College are to act
as a model of reform, to prove to the uni-
versity that something can be done to perk up
the monotony of the lecture system and to
involve the talents of the community’s non-
academic people in the curriculums.

The University of Virginia and the Uni-
versity of North Carolina are two of the
schools in this area which have established
such a program on their campuses. The cata-
logue of the Experimental College at U.N.C.
states, “In many ways the Experimental Col-
lege represents the belief that education
experience is like a huge banquet table cov-
ered with a potpourri of foods, and it is the
student’s privilege to select what he wants
and leave the rest.”

The courses offered at U.N.C. and U.Va.
are open to anyone and are taught as seminars
from six to eight weeks, or as long as partici-
pants desire. There is no formal credit and
no grades are given. However, at U.N.C. it
is possible for certain students to enroll in
these courses on a pass-fail basis or to take

shells. If this approach is taken, then we feel them for honors credit in an “Individual
that a large part of the advantages of a 12- Interdisciplinary Study Program.”

6-12 curriculum will be lost.

well, 12-12-6 seems geared toward more of
the same sort of learning process, except for
its six weeks of independent study which could
conceivably turn into an extended term paper
exercise.

Manners with fortunes, humors turn
with climes,
Tenets with books, and principles
with times.
—Alexander Pope,
Moral Essays, Epistle I, Line 172

In the weeks to follow, we will watch for
the publication and fate of the Curriculum
Committee’s proposals with interest. The time
for a change in curriculum is definitely upon
us, but it is not so urgent that decisions for
or against a specific proposal be made quickly
out of predjudice or passion. If all of us are
in agreement that some form of change
should be made, a re-assessment of our educa-
tional goals should first be made in order
that the final decisions on each issue are ob-
jective and sound ones.

Change does not necessarily mean progress.
With a careful re-appraisal of our goals,
a candid study of the issues, and a sensitive
awareness towards faculty and student opin-
ion, the final decisions should not only mean
change, but also progress towards a more
meaningful educational environment. We
cannot afford a hollow change. —L.L.Me.

Students Respond to Poll

By JEFF SPENCE

The voice of WAL is now finally being heard. On
Wednesday this paper polled the student body with re-
spect of their feelings about curriculum in the school,
We would like to thank fellow students for disclaiming
the charge that we are apathetic.

The purpose behind the curriculum poll was to un-
cover the thoughts of the student body, an opinion that
is often neglected at WAL. It is our hope that the poll
might offer to the faculty a responsible estimation of
the curriculum that each student is subjected to and the
students’ viewpoint on new proposals for our future,

According to the figures compiled, we are able to
draw some basic conclusions, WAL students stand in
favor of a short-term program of study. The further
desire to have the short-term on the 12-6-12 plan which
places the independent study period between the first
and second semester, The majority of students taking
the poll believe that the short-term in question should
be graded on the basis of pass-fall,

U.Va. A Theater Games course “involves a
form of sensitivity training. It emphasizes
perception and communication;’”’ Human
Encounters is a course in which students visit
mental hospitals and relate their lives to those
of institutionalized mental patients and a
course in black history teaches a predomi-
nantly white student body about the American
Negro. (It has had to turn away many in-
terested students because of inadequate facili-
ties.)

The courses at U.N.C. are also intriguing.
They include Marxist-Christian Dialogue (dis-
cussions on man’s initiative and responsibility
in history) ; India and Its Culture; a study of
Marshall McLuhan; Electronic Music, Its
Literature and Techniques; Introduction to
Ham Radio; The Role of the Business Pro-
fessional in the Small Town Life; Why Are
We in Vietnam? and Let It All Hang Out
(for all “uninhibited people” to do ‘what
their hearts desire’’).

Thus, one can see these courses from the
conventional to the unconvential. Every de-
partment in the university or any whims of
individuals can be represented in this experi-
mental curriculum. The success of these pro-
grams (over 700 participate at U.Va.) has
done much to make educational reform live
issues of these campuses.

If learning has taken on new and interest-
ing forms at other schools, why can’t the same
thing happen at W&L? It can, if students will

e an active hand in instituting such a pro-
gram. It is only through the students that
this experiment in education can work.

All students here should talk about the
experimental college with faculty members
(many of whom have already expressed in-
terest in this but have doubts about student
participation in it) and suggest courses which
ought to be offered as part of the curriculum.
If the students gain the faculty’s support, then
the experimental university can serve as a
focal point to bring students and faculty to-
gether to fight for curriculum reforms. Even
if faculty support is not strong, students and
towns people can teach experimental courses
themselves, as they do at U.N.C., for they
— talents which university professors

It should also be pointed out that our free
Saturdays would provide opportune times for
these courses to meet. At the same time,
Saturday sessions would allow girls from sur-
rounding schools and interested people around
the city to participate.

We should begin to set this program up
now because major changes in the curriculum
are far from being accepted. Even if the
present curriculum is modified, we have no
guarantee that the curriculum’s substance,
i.e., the number and distribution of courses
from which we must choose, will be changed.

The experimental university may eventually
cause courses to be added to the curriculum,
as it has at other campuses; but, even if it
doesn’t, it will help interested and stimulated
students at W&L fill an intellectual void not
now filled by the university.

SOBLU

By RON KESSLER
Executive Editor

The Joint Committee for Control
of Lexington High School agreed last
night (Thursday) to support six de-
mands of The Local Student Organi-
zation for Black Unity (SOBU),

The demands agreed upon are:

1. The appointment of a commit-
tee to study the current social studies,
art, music, and literature curricula
for the purpose of revising such cur-
ricula to include an adequate pre-
sentation of the Black man’s role in
these fields.

2. The committee for the study of
current courses will be appointed by
the Joint Committee for Control, and
will include representatives selected
fom nominees of the Student Organi-
zation for Black Unity (SOBU) in-
cluding one non-voting student-mem-
ber of SOBU.

3. It is understood that initial
curriculum changes in current courses
in social studies, art, music, and lit-
erature, with respect to Black culture,
would be ready for inclusion in the
1969-1970 school year.

4. Appoint a committee to plan a
Black Culture elective course for sub-
mission to the Joint Committee for
Control.

5. The committee for planning the
Black Culture course will be ap-
pointed by the Joint Committee for
Control, and will include representa-
tives selected from nominees of

 

Demands Met

SOBU including one non-voting stu-
dent-member of SOBU.

6. Should the committee for the
planning of a Black Culture course
arrive at a conclusion satisfactory to
the Joint Committee and the State
Board of Education in time for the
1969-1970 school year, it is under-
stood that said course will be includ-
ed in the curriculum that year,
Should the 1969-1970 deadline not
be met, it is also understood that
further action will be taken to insti-
tute the Black Culture courses in
1970-1971,

A list of demands were first pre-
sented on Monday to Lexington High
Schol principal Frank Thompson. This

Liberals Form

Ihe Progressive Student Alliance, a
newly-formed campus liberal group,
will hold its second meeting Monday
night at 9:00 in the basement of the
McCormick Library.

About 30 students, mostly fresh-
men, met last night to form the
group. Organizer Ron Abrams ex-
plained, “We want to change the
image of the school and get us off

the DAR’s list of the country’s most
conservative colleges.”

 

| Letters To The Editor . . |

 

End Phys. Ed.

To the Editor:

At W&L the only assumption which
is made concerning the character of
a student is that he is a gentleman.
In the traditional definition a “gentle-
man” is one who does not lie, cheat,
or steal, but the connotation of the
term suggests an intelligent and re-
sponsible individual, both capable and
willing to express an opinion in an
orderly, respectful manner. The stu-
dent body tries to maintain this stand-
ard behavior (we haven't burned any
buildings lately and don’t intend to
do so in the foreseeable future).

But gentlemanly behavior should
not be construed to mean that every-
thing on the WAL campus meets with
the approval of the student body.
Rather, it means that the members
of the W&L student body as a whole
enjoy being treated as gentlemen and
that they are willing to act as gentle-
men in order to be so treated.

Why is it, then, that for two years
we are reduced to the status of
forced laborers in a foul smelling
gymnasium? If the assumption is that
a sound mind and a sound body go
together, I ask you to locate a
mind among our “sound-body” people
in the gym. If theintent is to introduce
us to “adult” sports which we would
not otherwise master and enjoy, then
several flaws apepar in the present
system.

First, given mandatory attendance,
people of various athletic interests
(ranging from none to moderate) are
placed in the same class. Thus, any-

one who may want to learn a sport
of skill will not receive the individual
attention necessary in perfecting that
particular sport or skill, Thus indi-
viduals who have learned to play a
sport have usually done so on their
own without help from the P.E. de-
partment. And observe the method of
instruction currently in practice at
Doremus Gym—two weeks of jump-
ing rope and the punching bags, and |
a couple of periods in the handball |
courts.

Not enough time is spent on the
“sports” taught to be of any value.
And the sports which are taught are
generally of two varieties: first, those
that are completely useless, (i.c.,
soccer and tumbling), and, second,
those sports which one can easily
pick up oneself if one has the interest
(i.c., bowling and golf). Also, what
effect does P.E. have upon a student
in his academic work? No one enjoys
carrying a mandatory sixth course;
least of all if the course is scheduled
such that the student has to run
across campus (soaking wet from a
shower, tying his tie en route) in a
desperate attempt not to be late
for another class.

If you of the faculty really believe
that we in the student body are
gentlemen, then please show us that
you so believe by getting rid of the
physical education requirement. The
student body, as a whole, acts in the
mature, orderly fashion that denotes
a gentleman, and I, in this writing,
am attempting to do so.

Please respond to us as gentlemen.

Victory Over Emory and Henry
Gives W&L Small College Title

Washington and Lee clinched the
Virginia State Small College basket-
ball championship Tuesday night by
defeating Emory and Henry 68-63 in
overtime at Emory and Henry.

The game was a see-saw battle all

the way. Emory and Henry led by
as many as seven in the first half
before W&L could come back to

take a 33-29 halftime lead.

Emory and Henry slowed the Gen-
erals’ attack down in the second half
and regained the lead. The Wasps
were ahead by nine points with 7:41
left in the game. W&L then switched

to a tight press and came within five
points of Emory and Henry. Then
the Wasps went into a freeze, but

lost momentum as WAL stole the ball
twice and tied the game up on a
basket by Charlie Stone. During the
last 7.41 the Generals outscored the
Wasps by 11-2, which was enough
to send the game into overtime.
WAL came into the overtime period
with a freeze to get Emory and Henry
out of its 1-3-1 zone. W&L controlled
the ball for two minutes before Mel
Cartwright field goal on a

Stege provided the highlight of the

The Centre-Sewanee game saw

The game was tied seven times,
The largest lead Centre could amass
was during the first half when the
Prayin’ Colonels led by five points
at one time. The score at the half
was Centre, 29-26, over Sewanee.

David Blake was the high scorer
for Centre with 17 points. He was
closely followed by Buddy Baker
with 14 points and Mike Cochran

with 12. Bob Knight scored 19
points for the losing Tigers of

University of Tennessee at Martin,
Georgia State and Sewanee. The
Memphis school split two games

Except for a few veterans being

some promising freshmen who did
not play last fall has boosted the size
of the squad. The ideal conditions of

also contributed to the large numbers

Teams Defend Titles

Three Washington and Lee athletic
teams are competing this weekend
for the College Athletic Conference
championships in their respective
sports.

The W&L basketball team will take
a 18-4 record to Southwestern Uni-
versity (Memphis) to defend its CAC
title and fight for its third straight
championship, The Generals open to-
night at 7 o’clock against Centre Col-
lege.

If W&L wins tonight, the Generals
will meet the winner of the Wash-
ington University-Southwestern game.
If the Generals should lose, they
will meet the loser of the Washington
University-Southwestern game. All
W&L games will be broadcast on
WLUR-FM.

The Generals, as the Virginia State
Small College champions, will face

stiff competition in the much im-
proved CAC. The team to watch
this year will be host team South

western, which has met W&L in the
finals for the last two years. The
Lynx go into the tournament with a
19-3 record. This, plus the home
court advantage the team enjoys, will
make it a formidable opponent.

Centre College of Danville, Ky.,
goes into the tournament with an
11-10 record. This is a comeback
for the Prayin’ Colonels who began
the season at 2-8. Sewanee should
not pose too much of a problem for
any team, as it enters competion with
1 3-14 record.

Swimming Championships

Washington and Lee's swimmers
are taking an 8-2 record to Sewanee
for the CAC swimming champion-
ship which began to day. The only
team which should give W&L any
trouble is a much improved team
from the host school.

WAL, as state swimming champ-
ions, are weak in the breaststroke,
