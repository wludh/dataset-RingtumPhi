Who’s in Charge

W&L Trustees
Still Rule But
Have Delegated
No One Can Really

Say Who Holds
Seats Of Power

 

Students Have Little To Do

By Reep Byrum,
Tue Rinc-Tum Put Staff.

The Board of Trustees of Wash-
ington and Lee University represent
the most ultimately powerful organi-
zation upon this campus today; un-
contested as this statement may go,
this group, however, no longer holds
true control over the administration
of the innumerable functions of this
college.

Since 1964 when the Self-Study
Committee of Washington and Lee
reported to the school that a “revised
plan of administrative organization
should be adopted” by the Board of |
Trustees, this generally unnoticed
organ of power has undergone al- |
most a complete change, implement- |
ing an entirely new governmental
establishment. A broad outline of
this can be rather easily obtained by
referring to page 411 of “The Self-
Study Report of Washington and Lee
University,” with more concise deline-
ation of this plan being available in
the preceding 15 pages. A rather brief
summary of the present system of
control will now be given for the
sake of both expediency and facility.

The Board of Trustees maintains
executive responsibility of Washing-
ton and Lee, being that it is the rul-
ing corporate body of the university.
Containing fifteen lifetime members
and the president, this group assigns
administrative responsibility to the
faculty and leadership, maintains the
financial stablity of the school, elects
new presidents and trustees, and pro-
vides for the academic and physical
excellence of the college.

The President of the University acts
as liason officer for the Board with
the other officers of the administra-
tion. It is his duty to convey the
desires of the Trustees to the deans
and to the faculty and to secure con-
tinuity and stability in the administra-
tion of the school, He sets forth the
policies of the Board and then makes
sure that these are carried out by
his subordinate associates. The latter
are the dean and assistant dean of

 

 

 

the College, dean of the College of
Law, and dean of the School of
Commerce and Administration. They
also convey the directives of the
Board, but only those of general
policy making; within each of these |
academic divisions, autonomous gov- |
ernment is maintained by their re-
spective officers and faculty.

Under the dean of the College
are the registrar and the teaching
body of this division. The dean is)
the chief administrator and is chair-|
man of the Executive Committee of
the academic staff, the latter body
making general recommendations of
concern to the entire College. The

faculty is divided into numerous sub- |
committees, such as the Curriculum,
the Admissions, and the Courses and
Degrees Committees, which are in
charge of studying and enforcing vari-
ous faculty policies and making)
recommendations to the body as a
whole. The Schools of Law and Com-
merce are similarly structured with
only minor modifications to accomo-
date their own needs.

The president once again enters the
organization in the fifth level of
power in his direct leadership of the
Dean of Students, the MeCormick
Library, and two special assistants to
himself. The Dean of Students directs
with aid from subordinates the Ad-
missions Office, the Financial Aid
Office, the Chaplain’s Office, and the
Health Services; the library is per:
sonally run by the librarian, whose
total responsiblity is the maintainence
of McCormick. One assistant to the
president directs the Office of In
formation and Publications, the Office
of Institutional Research, and Lee
Chapel, while the other has jurindic-
tion over the service and grounds
staffs and the service organizations,
such as the Book Store and the

Dining Hall

ATURDAY — CLASSES

were abolished yesterday
by the faculty in a voice vote.
Next semester a new class
scheduling arrangement will go
into effect, whereby there will
be three meetings of one class
one week (the “odd” week)
and two meetings the next
(“even”) week.

The plan which will go into
effect is currently being used
at Lynchburg College; it was
proposed to the student body
for a vote last spring by The
Tuesday Ring-tum Phi, in
which vote it was overwhelm-
ingly favored; it was endorsed
by the student body Executive
Committee this fall; and it was
recommended by the faculty
committee-as-a-whole in Octo-
ber.

Under the new scheduling

Monday through Friday, and
are completed at 12:55. Per-
iods are 55 minutes long;
afternoon schedules (labs,
seminars, etc.) and examina-
tions are not affected. The
school year will remain the

same.

Deferred pledging activi-
ties will be mandatory for fra-
ternities next year, as the IFC
approved unanimously in an
18-0 vote on a motion by vice-
president Roddy Roediger that
rallies, work days, and the like
be outlawed for first-semester
pledges.

Greek Week was also abo-
lished, by voice vote, on a mo-
tion by Roediger. In its stead
will go some event to be de-
termined later by the IFC.

And in unprecedented act-
ion, the IFC voted 12-0-5 to
outlaw fraternity rush publica-
tions, on a motion by junior
justice Bob Trout. Each house
will be alloted 3 pages in the
official IFC rush publication,

The motions passed by the
IFC at last week's meeting are

What's News—

Little News i

On recommendation of the Ex-
ecutive Committee of the faculty, the
faculty at its meeting on December
9 approved the following policies with
reference to allowing students ex-
cused absence to leave school early
to work before the Christhas holi-
days:

A student who submits evidence
that he has a job and a statement
that he is currently receiving financial
aid may, on application, be excused
for a maximum of 2 days (Dec. 20
and 21). Applications for such ex-
cuses should be made on or before
Dec. 16, Monday, to the office of the
Associate Dean of the College, Dr.
Waitt.

After the holidays, the excused stu-
dent shall report to Dr. Watt on his
employment to validate the excuse of
his absences. Otherwise, such absences
shall be considered unauthorized.

The Troubadour Theatre next week
will present Dr. Keith J. Shilling-
ton’s adaptation of Eurypides’ “The
Bacchae.” Performances will run
from December 17 through 20; cur-
tain is at 8:30. Reservations may be
made by phoning 463-2181, and ask-
ing for the Troubadour Theatre ex-
tension.

The cast of “The Bacchae” con-
sists of Jeb Brown as Dionysus, Carr
Garnett as Tiresias, Bob Baroody as
Cadmus, Hugh Hill as Pentheus, Dave
Katz as the Captain, Pat Bednarczyk,
as the Herdsman, Andrew Wyndham
as the Messenger, and Carlisle Land-
reth as Agave.

Backing up the production will be
music created by Tom Mitchell which
can be best described as hard rock.
Joe Bates designed the lighting, mak-
ing great use of strobe lights and
other psychedelic effects. In contrast
to these effects, the cast will be dress-
ed in traditional Greek costumes and
full masks.

Explaining the somewhat unusual
staging of this production, Trouba-
dour director Lee Kahn stated: “We're
experimenting with the form in order
to find a way to present the classics
for a modern audience.”

By Reeve KELsey,
Tue Rinc-Tum Put Staff.

“Eighteen national social fraterni-
ties are represented on the Washing-
ton and Lee campus... All eighteen
fraternities maintain chapter houses
in Lexington, and the University re-
quires a resident housemother for
each. Approximately eighty per cent
of all Washington and Lee students
affiliate with fraternities, making
these organizations an important in-
fluence upon student life.”

The brief account of fraternities
quoted above from the University
Bulletin does poor justice to represent-
ing fraternities to the public. Besides
the academic work of the student,
fraternities are the most important
facet of the University for a large
majority of W&L gentlemen. The
evolution of fraternities into their
present format of eighteen nationals
proves very interesting history where
it is increasingly impossible to dis-
tinguish legend from fact.

it all started in 1855 when Phi
Kappa Psi became the first national
on the campus. There is strange irony
that next year they will present the
facade of the newest as they move
into their newly constructed house,
clearly confident of the future.

The great splurge of fraternity ex-
pansion started immediately after the
Civil War when 10 charters were
granted in the 7 year period from
1865 to 1873; we hasten to add that
§ of these chapters are now defunct,
but that is a later story, The most
recent period of fraternity expansion
was during the 1920s which saw 5
new chapters ultimately emerge at
WAL,

A grand total of 26 nationals have
at one time or another been represent-
ed in Lexington, While some had
their charters revoked, others merely
faded out of existence.

Alpha Tau Omega provides per-
haps the most interesting saga, Much
legend has surrounded this fraternity
including the much repeated epsiode
with the C&O railroad, although this
event is not the major reason for
their demise. The ATOs reasoned
(somewhat incorrectly) that if they
removed their mortgage from the Uni-
versity, the University would no long-
er have any control over their activi-
ties (assumption incorrect), They then
obtained a loan from a Staunton bank
and purchased the remaining portion
of the mortgage from the University,

Then, as Dean Gilliam tells it,
the fateful day of December 7, 1941,
rudely intervened and most of the
fraternities became inactive. The be-
nevolent University suspended all
interest and principal payments for
the duration of the war and granted
each fraternity a gift of $2000 to help
it get started again, But the ATO's
bank in Staunton, being essentially a
profit making institution, needed its
money, and when the ATOs could)
not make the payments the bank |
foreclosed and sold the house, The
ATOs returning from the war, lack-
ing a house, money, and the impetus
to start again, simply faded away

IT CAN'T BE SAID that the W&L
faculty isn’t keeping busy with its
research and writing. In the past few
years, the faculty has produced over
thirty books dealing with a wide
range of topics.

THE MOST RECENT ADDITION
to the list of faculty publications is
Dr. Allen W. Moger’s “Virgnia:
Bourbonism to Byrd, 1870 to 1925.”
The book is a general history of
Virginia from its restoration days to
the election of Harry F. Byrd as
governor. It deals with the develop-
ment of the Democratic Party and
the Conservative heritage of Virginia
politics.

to work on the book. The book,
which will be published in May, 1969
by Random House, one of America’s
most distinguished publishing houses,
will be called “General Lee's Col-

Our System

A 100-Year-Old
Tradition Still
Lives At W&L

 

Code Administrators
Retain Honor’s
Ultimate Penalty

But Some Say Honor’s Out

By Ropert H. Yevicn,
Tue Rinc-Tum Pui Staff.

One of the fundamental aspects of
life at W&L over the past century
has been the tradition of the honor
system. The fact that this deliberate
tradition, enforced by the students,
has flourished for so long testifies to
that unique power it exercises over
the students. Certainly, if students
did not respect the honor system, it
would have been buried with the
nineteenth century.

But what is that power it exercises
which has made it a fact of life at
WAL for one hundred years? In
theory, the honor system encompasses
every area of a student's behavior
while he is associated with the insti-
tution. This gentlemanly code dates
back to the character mold poured
by Robert E. Lee during his admini-
stration as president of Washington
College. Ideally, the driving force of
the honor system lies in its ability
to instill in students the desire to be
such perfect gentlemen.

But, in practice, the honor system
connotes a more realistic meaning to
the students of 1968. This meaning
consists of the realization that if a
student commits an infraction of
those hallowed rules of behavior, and
is ensnared by the laws of the code,
he may then be asked to leave.

Naturally, the administration of
this code is an important facet of
the honor system. The tangible aspect
of the system is left squarely on the
shoulders of the “supreme court” of
the student body, the elective Ex-
ecutive Committee. Frequently, their
assigned task of governing their fel-
low students amounts to administer-
ing the honor system by interpreting
the honor code.

In consideration of the size of
the University. the element of secrecy
was introduced to afford a certain
amount of protection to those students
who in some way might become in-
volved with the mechanics of the
system. Usual honor trials are con-
ducted by the Executive Committee
behind closed doors with the names
of defendents and witnesses gener-
ally withheld from public knowledge.

However, the advantage of an open
honor trial is available to a student
who feels that he has been unjustly
convicted of an honor offense in a
closed honor trial.

Again, the question of whether or
not a conviction (or acquittal) was
just or unjust rests solely upon the
interpretation of the Executive Com-
mittee. This avenue for change is a
necessary part of the system. If the
system was not flexible, then it would
become stagnant and lose the respect
it commands over the students,

Fortunately. few students meet the
reality of the honor system head on,
To tell what it is like to have been
asked to leave the University because
of a violation of the honor system,
an anonymous letter by a student who
was convicted of an honor offense
appears on page two of this paper

For most students, encounters with
the honor system are limited to lec
tures at freshman camp, and occas
ional boosters in the form of EC
statements, open honor trials, and
various University publications, How
ever, the threat of the ultimate pen
alty remains strong in the minds of
every student, and it is this threat
which keeps the system alive more
than devotion to the ideal

Recent events pertaining
honor sysiem have generated some
speculation regarding especially the
ability of the system to adapt ade
quately to various situations, In fe
sponse to certain suggestions offered
at last months “Bitch-in,” increased
study is being made by members of
the EC on the honor
application. its direction

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Responding

An immediate result of last
month’s Executive Committee
“Bitch-in” is the yet-to-be form-
ulated committee on student civil
liberties, headed by senior Jack
Horowitz. Apparently it is Mr.
Horowitz's concern (and the con-
cern of others, if the dialogue at
the “Bitch-in” is a true indicator)
that the EC’s practice of searching
students’ quarters at its discretion
is not a legitimate function of that
body.

Mr. Horowitz may have a point.
In discussing such questions about
the EC’s role in this University,
two fundamental questions need to
be approached: 1) To what exent
is the EC an investigative body?
and 2) What resolution can be
made between individual rights and
the EC’s duty to the student body?

The Executive Committee, de-
spite what some like to say, is an
investigative entity—it must be; and
in its very nature, that of a court
in toto, it must, as Mr. Horowitz
will surely want to point out, ex-
ercise its virtually unchained per-
quisites of power with unimpeach-
able fairness.

And while we're on the subject
of what the EC is doing, some
mention needs to be made of that
body’s impending study of the
Honor System.

It is our understanding that out
of this endeavor should come some
definite statements about the EC's
jurisdiction; a problem here, though,
would arise because such statements
could be interpreted as giving
license to otherwise dishonorable
actions in certain areas. It is also
our undestanding that some addi-
tional (or perhaps revised) pro-
cedures for honor trials will be
formulated. This is seen as an out-
growth of the open honor trial
option; aside from any moralizing,
it is not difficult to realize the pos-
sible discredit that may fall upon
the twelve justices when their ver-
dicts are publicly reversed. Per-
haps this kind of check needs to
be allowed—governmental court
systems work similarly; or, perhaps
such open scrutiny is dangerous to
the honor system.

These and other questions are to
be answered. The need, though
not an urgent one, is evident.

Leadership and Diplomacy

The faculty's lack of action on
deferred rush was a triumph of
sorts for the Inter-Fraternity Coun-
cil. Much could be said in support
of a case that there is no triumph,
that the action was indecisive, that
conditions are imposed on the IFC,
an so forth. But despite these argu-
ments, ultimate analysis awards
“triumph” to those who desired the
actual outcome.

More than anyone else, IFC
President Clark Carter deserves fra-
ternties’ commendation for his role
in this year’s Scenario of the Grand
Rush Drama. Throughout the past
months, his calm leadership and
cool diplomacy have earned the re-
spect of many faculty members—
not the least important of which

were those on the faculty EC.

And Mr. Carter has achieved for
his constitutents more than most
could have expected. His argu-
ments (and the arguments of those
in agreement) for mid-semester rush
must have made sense to many
faculty members.

Not to be ignored are those in
the faculty who, for whatever rea-
son, voted to maintain the status
quo. And at this point Mr. Carter
will find that his task has not
ended. His is the burden of steer-
ing fraternity leadership in this
fresh, positive way until long-need-
ed reforms in pledging activities
are accomplished. The faculty and
the fraternities should be confident
of his ability to do so.

At Long Last, It’s Ended

No more Saturday classes! We've
been waiting a long time to be able
to write that—since last March
when this edition first proposed the
idea and brought it to the attention
of the University community.

Starting next semester, the five-
day week will be a reality at Wash-
ington and Lee. We now join our
neighboring schools in the elimina-
tion of what has long proved an
inconvenience. God bless the fac-
ulty!

About This Edition

As a good friend of ours in the
administration said, the Journalism
Laboratory Press is intended to be
just that—a laboratory. It is with
this in mind that we have publish-
ed this Tuesday on the format of
The Wall Street Journal. But a
few additional comments now be-
come germaine.

It is more difficult than it may
seem tO eXperiment in this par-
ticular laboratory; for example,
such a minor change as the elimi-

ad

nation of column rules on the
editorial page could very likely
push the schedule up two hours
(which would mean the Wednesday
Ring-tum Phi).

Thus this edition was weeks in
the preparation and was difficult
at that. If the finer touches in this
paper today are evident, an especial
word of thanks is due Messrs.
Hunter McCoy and Ed Walker of
the Journalism Laboratory Press,
whose patience and extra time made
this edition possible.

The Sports History Of A Small College

By Roy Carton,
THE Rinc-Tum Pur Staff.

It was nearly fifteen years ago that
Washington and Lee surprised sports
enthusiasts all over the nation by
completely desubsidizing a fairly suc-
cessful athletic program. That deci-
sion was probably the most important-
one the Board of Trustees had made
since they elected Robert E. Lee as
President of the college in 1865. The
effects of that event reached far be-
yond the Athletic Department or
even the athletes on scholarship. It was
to affect the very character and stand-
ards of the University which we now
attend.

Athletics and W&L have gone hand
in hand since before the turn of the
century. Back in 1892, a handful of
Minks met their counterparts from
VMI and played the first intercol-
legiate football game south of the
Mason-Dixon line. It was hardly an
auspicious debut for the original Gen-
erals. The Keydets whipped them 6-0
to the embarrassment of every man
at the University.

In following years ,the contests con-
tinued and neighboring schools were
added to the schedule. Intercollegiate
sports became a favorite pastime, and
soon the whole University was getting
excited. A weekly sports page began
appearing in the late ‘90's named
after a favorite cheer, the Ring-tum
Phi. In 1906 the Trustees finally
buckled in to the pressure and built
Doremus Gymnasium, supposedly the
finest of its kind in the south. Also
in 1906, a W&L law student, Mark
Sheafe. made his greatest contribu-
tion to the school. He wrote the
Washington and Lee Swing.

Athletics entered their modern era
in 1933 with the founding of the
Southern Conference. The Generals
joined with other schools in the region
such as Duke, UNC, Maryland, and
South Carolina to form a first class
league. It was also at this time that
subsidization became the byword of
athletics at the University. In order
to compete on the same high level
as conference foes in basketball and
football, athletic scholarships were
granted and recruiting became a
frenzied effort.

The war years halted athletics
temporarily. The student body was
drastically reduced so that the build-
ings could be used by the armed
forces. Athletics ceased to exist. With
the return of peace in 1945 though,
sports, notably football and basket-
ball were revived. The late forties
were particularly lean years. Con-
ference opponents had been compet-
ing continuously, so the Generals had
to start from scratch. About the only
sport that enjoyed success was wrestl-
ing. Throughout the thirties, the Blue
had dominated SC wrestling, and
once again they took up their throne.

The great resurgence of W&L foot-

ball fortunes began in 1950. With ai ;

3-5-1 record the year before, the
Minks weren't exactly given glowing
praise in the pre-season estimates.
Coach Barclay had a hard corps of
capable experienced players, though,
in quarterback Gil Bocetti, fullback
Walt Michaels, and center Joe Me-
Cutcheon.

The 1950 Generals were one of
the most explosive teams in WAL
history. Led by the running of
Bocetii and Michaels from a split-T
formation, they scored twenty or
more points in every contest of the
season. The two biggest games just
happened to be WAL's only two de-
feats of the season, too. The Minks
traveled to UVa. for the annual bash
with the Wahoos in early October.
In front of a fierce Cavalier crowd,
the Blue held on to the lead against
a good UVa. team until the final
moments when the Wahoos pulled
out a 27-21 win.

Toward the end of the season, it
became the Generals’ turn to beat
their heads against a stone wall. The
Blue went to Knoxville to face num-

ber one ranked Tennessee. In their |
best game of the year, the Blue came |
close io doing the impossible and

fell short by 27-20,

Season's end found the Minks rank-
ed sixteenth in the country and re-
warded them with their first and
only trip to a bowl. Eleventh ranked
Wyoming was the Generals’ Gator
Bow! opponent, but illness struck and
Michaels and others missed the game.

The result was a forgetable 20-7
drubbing.

A poor football team in 1953
brought matiers to a head. The

alumni were screaming for an in-
crease in athletic scholarships beyond
the thirty already being given. To do
this, the University would have to
stari supporiing the debis of the
Athletic Department, As the spring
of ‘$4 approached, the Trustees look-
ed like they might be about to give
if.

That spring. Washingion and Lee
was rocked by one of the biggest
cheating scandals in iis history. For
some two years, a janitor had heen
gelling copies Of tesis for a group

 

 

of football players. By the time the
Executive Committee had ruled on
all the offenders, the football team
had been decimated. Many of those
who remained unscathed sensed that
WA&L’s gridiron status was liable to
change drastically and transferred to
other colleges.

The Trustees now had to face the
athletic aid question directly. If sub-
sidized football was to remain, many
more scholarships would have to be
given to make up for the last play-
ers. Many Trustees were unhappy
about the idea of admitting players
who might not otherwise be accepted,
especially in the light of the scandal.
The decision was made to suspend
the awarding of more scholarships.
Six had already been granted for
1954-55, Those currently receiving aid
would continue to until graduation.
The 1954 football schedule was for-
feited for the lack of a team.

As the months passed, the Trustees
decided to continue football, but on
a completely unsubsidized _ basis.
Temporarily, W&L would remain in
the Southern Conference.

The winter of 1957-58 saw the last
gasp of big-time college athletics at
the University. The few remaining
scholarship players were seniors then.
After the spring W&L would with-
draw from the SC. One of the play-
ers, a basketball guard named Dom
Flora, took the Generals out in style.

 

The roundballers only finished with
a 9-16 record that year, but Flora had
the distinction of being the last ma-
jor All-American from W&L. A tre-
mendous shooter, Flora was selected
to the first-string team with Oscar
Robertson, Guy Rodgers, Elgin Bay-
lor, and Wilt Chamberlain. After
graduating from the University, Flora
took a try at the NBA but didn’t
make it.

Unsubsidized athletics has brought
a different era to Washington and
Lee sports. University admissions
policies preclude any hope of a suc-
cessful return to the big-time, but
this school has found its nook. The
great football teams of 1960-61-62
have proven that small college status
can be fun. The undefeated and un-
tied team of 1961 even brought
status to the school in the form of
number one small college ranking by
the Washington Touchdown Club,
WA&L’s athletic program also offers
a chance for more men to play on
teams, and it provides better equip-
ment for those who do. Before de-
subsidization the soccer team had an
annual budget of $200.

Small college athletics may not
make the front sports page of the
New York Times or win any Gator
Bowl bids, but it does meet the
needs of the studnets. And, for those
form whom this is not good enough,
Washington and Lee does have a past.

 

Notable & Quotable

 

President Robert E. R. Huntley

on the image of Washington and).

Lee, in his inaugural address,

October 18.

... Et is the image of an institution
which unashamedly proclaims that
there is no higher goal to which a
scholar can aspire than to be a
vital teacher of young men, an insti-
tution which confidently entrusts the
largest possible measure of choice and
freedom to its students and its fac-
ulty, requiring conformity of no one,
prizing an environment in which tol-
erance, integrity, and respect for
others tend to prevent misidentifying
independence of thought with lack of
self-discipline or mindless contempt.

It is the image of an institution
which does not wish to cater to any
particular ethnic or economic group,
but which seeks a diverse student
body and faculty where members may
share in common only the ability
and the conviction to learn from each
other.

It is the image of an institution
which takes seriously the injunctions
which are engraved in its official crest,
adapted, as you know, from the
family coats of arms of the two great
men after whom the school is named:

 

*

“Be not unmindful of the future.”
. » “Question all things.”

It is not the image of an institu-
tion which serves as a marshalling
point or strategy center from which
young men are sent forth daily to
confront the sources of evil the
strategists have identified. Rather, it
is the image of an institution which
sees no prority as higher than the
search for truth and understanding
from which eventually may grow the
kind of wisdom that brings fullness to
life.

What of this image?

It this where the action is?

Or, in the strangely contemptuous
tone of the more recent idiom—lts it
relevant?

The only answer | know is this:
If it is relevant to lead forth the
mind from the dark corners in which
it feeds on its own prejudice and
arrogance and self-righteousness, if,
in short, it is relevant for there to be
men who are truly educated, then
this image is relevant.

Therefore, if at Washington and
Lee University today reality does not
measure up to the image, then let
us be about the business of closing

the gap.

 

 

 

By Daviv Fretp,
Tue Rinc-Tum Put Staff.

John Updike’s “Couples” presents
a bleak picture of the epoque in which
we live; it is “one of those dark
ages that visits mankind between
millenia, between the death and re-
birth of gods, when there is nothing
to steer but sex and stoicism and the
stars.” Traditional religion has thus
lost relevance in this hopeless situa-
tion, and we have had to substitute
humans for God. They are, however,
inadequate: the tragedy of the Ken-
nedy family underlines the main plot:
“Strange, he thought, how pain seeks
that couple out. Not wealth nor
beauty no homage shelters them. Suf-
fering tugging at a king's robe. Our
fragile gods.”

Furthermore, there has been an
exodus from the church as a religious
institution: the movement to suburban
communities has fostered a new “re-
ligion” whose foundation is inter-
personal relationships. Updike ex-
plores this idea by examining Tarbox,
a suburb of Boston, and focusing on
the activities of ten couples. We are
immediately aware of both the ritu-
alistic, religious aspect of this culture
and iis sexual overtones. The small
group of couples is described as “a
circle. A magic circle of heads to
keep the night out.” They have “made
a church of each other.”

This new church is not wiccessful,
however, for as the couples’ private
lives are probed it becomes apparent
that the “magic circle” is not a source
of unity and strength, but rather the
boundary within which each of the
participanis is destroyed. A keyhole
view of the devastation of two couples
is provided as Updike zooms in on
the Applebys and Smiths. His de-
scription of their aspirations shows
his conception of one segment of
American society:

“They belonged to that segment of
iheif generation of the upper middle

 

class which mildly rebelled against
the confinement and discipline where-
by wealth maintained its manners dur-
ing the unheavals of depression and
world war . . . Introduced into a
nation whose leadership allowed a
toothless moralism to dissemble a
certain practiced cunning, into a cul-
ture where adolescent passions and
homosexual philosophies were not
quite yet triumphant, a climate still
furtively hedonist . . . to this new
world the Applebys and Smiths
brought a modest determination to
be free, to be flexible and decent
... They... settled the year round
in unthought-of places, in pastoral
mill towns like Tarbox, and tried to
improvise here a fresh way of life.
Duty and work yielded as ideals to
truth and fun. Virtue was no longer
sought in temple or market place
but in the home—one’s own home,
and then the homes of one’s friends.”

The Applebys and Smithes are un-
able to attain their goal of a new
virtue, however. Contrast their ideals
expressed above with the following
scene in the Appleby's laundry room;
Harold Appleby and Janet Smith
have just discovered beyond a doubt
that their mates are having an affair
with each other: “Her body, his
height, they dragged each other down,
into a heap of unwashed clothes,
fluffy ends of shirtsleeves and pajama
pants, the hard floor underneath them
like a dank bone .. . His face was
half-pillowed in dirty clothes smelling
mildly of his family, of Jonathan and
Julia and Henrietta and Marcia. He
was lying on ghosts that had in-
nocently sweated.”

Thus their ambition to find ful-
fiilment in a circle of personal friends
turned to a pathetic adulterous
jumble. The cause is both from with-
out and within: from without, there
is this age in which “there is nothing
to steer but sex and stoicism and
the siars.” That conception of sex

On Being Kicked Out

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

There are a lot of fears, I’m sure,
surrounding the operations of the
Honor System at Washington and
Lee—and let me tell you that they
are well-founded fears. I was the
victim of the cruel but necessary pro-
cedures of the Honor System, and
was cast, less than fate in the familiar
song, not to the winds, but into the
doldrums of despondency and self-
despite.

IT am a better man for having
been asked to leave the school. (By
the way, they do ask you to leave,
I guess if you said no, they'd make
you though.) But this is of small con-
solation as I am brought to tears
at each of the frequent remembrances
of having spoiled my very own con-
science,

What I did was done in a moment
of frenzy—a paper, due the next
day, was not even begun yet. What
could I do but steal? Of course, the
answer is that I could have done
a hell of a lot more, including flunk-
ing the course, but I chose the route
of dishonor. | found a very good
book, and I copied it, or rather parts
of it, in such great detail and with
such a lack of finesse or whatever
I should have used that I was im-
mediately discovered by the profes-
sor involved.

At the Honor Trial, I readily ad-
mitted what I had done, | was asked
why. I said because | wanted to get
away with something, that | wanted
to cover up for work which I had
not really done myself. | suppose that
was all that needed to be said, other
than perhaps the professor telling the
EC all about how much I had
plagiarized.

That's about all there is to it. I

THE RING-TUM PHI, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1968

 

The Bookshelf

originates on Madison Avenue and
filters through the whole society: “All
her formal education, from Disney's
‘Snow White’ to last week’s ‘Life,’
had taught her to place the highest
value on love. Nothing but a kiss
undid the wicked apple. We move
from birth to death amid a crowd of
others and the name of the parade
is love. However unideal it was, she
dreaded being left behind. Hence she
could not stop flirting, could not
stop reaching out...”

Is there any answer to this world
which seems to have a_ built in
misery factor? Perhaps, for one source
of the misery is within: “What im-
presses me isn’t so much human
self-deception as human igenuity in
creating unhappiness. We believe in
it, unhappiness is in us. From Eden
on, we've voted for it. We manu-
facture misery, and feed ourselves
on poison.” We have built much of
our culture on a chase: we chase
after love, after success—concepts
which are too diaphanous to grasp
even if they exist.

“Couples” is limited in scope, aim-
ing its barbs exclusively at one stratum
of American society; nevertheless, it
must be realized that this is the sec-
tor of our body politic which has
been called the “carriers of the creed;”
these are those to whom the less well
endowed look for their styles, and
to whom those who lead the country
listen, Represented among the couples
are scientists, successful businessmen,
a dentist, a contractor—in short, in-
fluential citizens. Their
though not
portant and, to the extent Updike
accurately generalizes, his is a valu-
able book. He limits himself, how-
ever, to what is almost one factor
analysis: the reader is carried along
on a sea of pubis throughout the
entire tone. One gets tired of read-
ing of each of the characters’ sexual
idiosyncracies and impotencies—it
would seem that more than sex
drives men onward “toward the cliff.”
Updike’s analysis, like those whom he
analyzes, is severly limited. Thus
the book, like its characters, is in-

maladies, |
the countries’, are im-|

fluential but not great; it somehow
fails to rise above the social milieu
and is satified at the mere hinting of
ideas which would permit liberation
from a stultifying atmosphere.

On Being Kicked Out

bers of the EC, who helped me
arrange things. You see, I wanted,
very much, to leave as soon as pos-
sible. I knew a notice would be up
the next day, and I knew many would
know who it was. And I’m. sure
the EC wanted me to leave right
away, too. They acted that way. It
was sort of like a silent understand-
ing between us.

Nothing was said as | and those
two EC members walked around with
me, except I asked them if 1 could
be alone to call my parents. I guess
1 should have called them before,
but whenever you're in trouble like
that (not many of us are, I hope!),
you always have some hope that it
will all blow over and that you can
forget about it and go in the class
as though nothing had happened. So
I called by parents that night, late,
very late, and told them | had been
convicted of an Honor Violation.
There was no reaction, just silence.
I went on and explained to them
all the details of it, then told them
1 would fly home soon, that I had
enough money. | told them I was
sorry for the money they had wasted,
that | would try to make it up to
them.

My parents made it easy on me.
My mother cried, of course, but she
| said things like, “My poor baby,”
and “We still love you.” I started
crying too. My father said not to
worry about anything, that he would
wire a ticket to Roanoke that night,
and that he was sure | could get
into a college very soon. We hung up,

all of us in tears by then.

As I rejoined the two EC mem-
bers, crying (me, not them), I could
sense not only their pity, which is a
great thing for a man to feel of
another, but also their sense of duty
and their sense of pride in having
done the right thing.

The Ring-tum Phi asked me to
write this, because, they said, it was
for an important paper which would
deal with fundamental aspects of
Washington and Lee. | am happy to
offer this to the students of W&L
through the Ring-tum Phi, hoping
that everyone will take a good hard
look at the Honor System, will keep
my story in mind, and will act ac-
cordingly. I really don’t mean to
preach, but you just try to live with
yourself if you get kicked out of
college for an honor violation.

ington and Lee, and overall, thirty
division of responsibility can be made
among this grandiose systems of ad-
ministration. However, the most im-
portant part of this university has
seemingly been overlooked: the stu-
dent body. But it enters this organi-
zational setup in only the most in-
significant and infrequent manners.

Students at W&L are represented
on only four of some thirty-six faculty

ments or will; for they are restricted
from attendance or membership in
either of these groups and must thus
employ indirect methods of exposing
their views. It is hastened to be add-
ed that such means are far from
obscure, and the faculty and the presi-
dent individually maintain a constant
level of communication and of com-
prehension of student needs.

Thus, Washington and Lee pos-
sesses an extremely complex, yet well
organized, system of administration
through the Board of Trustees, with
the ultimate purpose being to serve
the ever present needs of the student
body.
