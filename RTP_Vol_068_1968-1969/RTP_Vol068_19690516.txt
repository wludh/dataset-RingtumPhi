Dana Foundation
Announces Gift

Washington and Lee has received
a grant of $250,000 from the
Charles A. Dana Foundation of
Greenwich, Conn. to help provide the
university with new facilities for its
School of Commerce and Admini-
stration, President Robert E. R. Hunt-
ley announced today.

One of two major undergraduate
divisions at Washington and Lee, the
School of Commerce and Administra-
tion has been identified by President
Huntley as among four areas of ma-
jor need in the institution's physical
facilities.

Other high priority projects under
study at Washington and Lee include
a $2,2000,000 addition to Doremus
Gymnasium, new facilities for the
School of Law, and a new central
library.

President Huntley said the Dana
gift in support of the School of Com-
merce and Administraion is “especi-
ally gratifying and timely.”

“This grant of a quarter of a mil-
lion dollars will give impetus to our
planning, and it will help focus at-
tention on the School's requirements
among alumni and other friends on
whom we are depending for fianancial
assistane,” President Huntley said.

He said the Dana grant is a “sub-

| stantial fraction” of the total funds

that will be sought to provied new

| facilities for the School of Com-

Pabsavank Lee Win F. J. Gilliam Prize

Because of his leadership in a
variety of changes in student life dur-
ing 1968-69, the student body presi-
dent of Washington and Lee was a
co-recipient this week of two an-
nual student service awards,

Jay Passavant, a senior chemistry
major from Beaver, Pa., was awarded
both the coveted Gilliam Award and

one of the special citations presented | W&l
by the student newspaper, the Ring- |
tum Phi, for outstanding contributions |

to Washington and Lee.

The Gilliam Award also went to!

Randy Hale Lee, a senior law stu-
dent from Baltimore, who was cited
for a wide range of services to WAI

during his undergraduate and ad

studies here.
Established in 1963, the award is
named in honor of Dean Emeritus

Students Named
To Committees

The appointment of students to
serve on University committee study-
ing coeducation and the future size
of undergraduate enrollment was an-
nounced today by President Robert
E. R. Huntley,

Named to the study committee on
the question of coeducation at W&I
were William Michael Gottwald of
Richmond, Va., and Steven Bruce
Sandler of Norfolk, Va. The com-
mittee also includes seven faculty and
adminstration members, and Dr
Louis W. Hodges, professor of re
ligion, serves as chairman.

Appointed to the committee on size
were Dan Madison Leonard of Ros-
well, New Mexico, and Charles As-
bury Holt Jr. of Blacksburg, Va.

Also on the size committee are
nine faculty members. John M. Gunn,
associate professor of economics,
serves as chairman.

Both committees are to study in
formation that will be useful in de
cision making, according to President
Huntley. It is hoped that reports will

| be completed by the end of the cur

rent calendar year. The size com
mittee will study whether WA&l
should be smaller, larger, or the same
as current enrollment.

All four student committee mem
bers are rising seniors

Use Existing Set-Up

The Executive Committee is considering doing a very good
thing. We would like to urge them to do it.

Facing the perennial problem of what to do with the
Assimilation Committee, the EC has given it temporary juris-
diction over the Student Union. It is considering making this
arrangement permanent. It should.

The alternative is to create another committee solely for
the purpose of handling the Student Union once it opens. This
would not be objectionable if the Assimilation Committee
really had anything else to do. Its activities have in recent years
been confined to the management—or mismanagement—of
Freshman Camp and Organization Week. Because both these

events are over in September,

the considerable talent which

exists on the Assimilation Committee has been allowed to
atrophy the rest of the year. We feel it can be put to better

use.

To create another committee would be to increase un-
necessarily the organizational responsibilities of the EC while
maintaining in the student government bureaucracy a com-
mittee which is meaningless eight months of the school year.
The talent for the job is already available in the present set-up.

It needs to be put to use.

—R.L.E

 

A Word On Coverage

Although the Tuesday edition certainly spoke for us in
apologizing to the baseball team for the poor coverage it has
received in both Ring-tum Phis this year, we feel impelled to
express our own embarrassment.

We have no real defense for the charges; they are true,
and we are sincerely sorry. If, as might be claimed, “cir-
cumstances beyond our control” often preclude adequate re-
porting of many events important to W&L, we can pledge
only to try and control more of those circumstances next

year.

The althletic teams especially have always deserved more
journalistic attention than they have received, and we thank
Messrs. Mitchell and Wilson for calling attention to our short-

comings.

This brings us to our main point. Once again the staffs
are changing, and, while no staff can satisfy everyone in news
coverage, we eagerly solicit constructive criticism. If it seems
we are ignoring a group at W&L, a reminder will be appreci-

ated, and, we hope, sufficient.

For Next Year’s Dance Board

(Below is an interview with Dean
Kumpuris, President of the Dance
Board, obtained for the purpose of
clarifying the policies of next year's
Board. We appreciate the time he
has given and hope that this will
help clear up any questions which
the student body may have con-
cerning the dance plans and weck-
ends).

The Friday Ring-tum Phi: In light
of the recent decision to sell tickets
to the students, what will be the policy
concerning the sale of dance plans
for next year?

Dean Kumpuris: Last year's price of
$40.00 will be continued, but will in-
clude a great deal more than it has

remain non-transferrable because of |
the E.C. mandate of earlier in the

for the tickets to the individual con

certs and under what conditions will!
these be offered?

Kumpuris: To answer your second)

question initially, there will be no
conditions or restrictions upon the
sale of tickets; these will be made
available to the student body and to
the public. The tickets will be ex-
pensive, costing $10.00 per evening
per couple; the price far from

prohibitive, however, and is conveni- |

ent for those students who wish to

planned for mext year's schedule?

Kumpuris: We anticipate now having
either seven or eight different events
This will include two weekends in
which there will be two nights of
concerts. Also, we plan to have the

Dean Adams admits to a bias for
electives and whenever a
has sought his advice on

which electives to take, “be sure to

The common complaint of employers
nationally is that young persons are
going into business who cannot write

“They need to be exact in

points, to capture second place in the
overall standings.

out to be most hotly contested. Pi Phi

athletic talents and his attitude.

“He is one of the finest young men
I've ever coached” says Coach Verne
Canfield about Tom Rueger. He feels
he cannot say enough about the Nor-
folk, Va. senior in regard to his

Tom Rueger has been the number
one man on the tennis team for all
of his four years at W&L. This is
a first for any W&L player, and the
pressure that goes along with being
number one, which might seem to
make it a rather dubious honor, has
served as a challenge to Rueger.

Playing the likes of Duke, Mary-
land, and Virginia his 12-3 record

 

this season seems remarkable, except
for the fact that he has had a winning |
season every year. This is an ac-}|
complishment in itself.
Canfield says he is certainly one |
of the finest captains he has ever |
had, making a team sport out of what
is normally an individual sport. His |
off-the-court encouragement of the |
tennis team helped mold this year’s
team, which finished with an |
record and won its third straight CAC
i hampionship.
There is a spirit of mutual respect |
and enthusiasm between Canfield and |
Rueger. Tom feels that Coach Can- |
field was instrumental in bringing out |
the best in each individual player. |
| He also praises Canfield for his ability |
| to instill a winning spirit in the play- |
| ers,
| still a pleasure to play under him.
Tom feels for many reasons that
this season was the most satisfying

 

the team atmosphere, and the atten-
tion of Coach Canfield to the indi-
vidual players and to the team all
helped. Rueger’s record of 12- 3|
against the toughest competition he
has yet faced shows his satisfaction |
is well-founded.

tention to the team, saying, “He does
all he can under the circumstances.”

Tom feels the tennis program has
been more challenging each year he
has played. He cites the dropping of
schools like Roanoke, and their re-
placement with teams like Maryland
and Duke. But in spite of the tough-
ness of the schedule, Rueger says it

Mr. Lauck To Retire

(Continued from Page 2)

\fter working in print shops in
St. Louis, Lynchburg and Strasburg,
Va., Lauck learned that the position
at Washington and Lee was open.

“There were over 30 applicants, I
got the job because I was the only
one with a college degree.”

It wasn't long before Lauck made
a name for himself. The awards came
quickly and steadily: a medal for dis-
tinguished service to graphic art edu-
cation, first prize among 2,500
entrants in a typography contest,
election to the Royal Society of Arts
and Crafts of England.

“Inland Printer,” a leading trade
publication, featured him as one of
the nation’s best printers. He was
elected president of the International
Graphic Arts Education Associaion,
of which he was a charter member.

He constantly strove for excellence.
“| felt our work always had to be
the best because of the great men
associated with this University,” he
said,

“The print shop was not real
popular when I came here in 1932,”
Lauck recalled. “I sold the faculty
and department heads on using our
services by showing them we could
do top-quality work. Now everybody
on campus uses it.”

The WAL print shop today handles
most of the University’s publications,
including alumni magazine, two
literary magazines, the twice-a-week
student newspaper, and a multitude of
programs for such events as concerts,
lectures and sports events.

Volume has doubled since Lauck
took over. His original three-man staff
now numbers five.
