“The way

I see it’

(Editor's note: “The way I see it”
is a column of general editorial
comment for which contributions
are solicited from students and
facutly concerning any topic.)

By KIRK WOODWARD
Fran Lawrence wrote a good article
in this space lasi week about the
isolation from the “world” that this

school seems to impose on us.
Many of us who feel the way
Fran Lawrence does, feel especially
guilty about the situation because we
suspect we haven't done all the things

 

we ourselves could to correct the
school’s shortcomings.
Talking about “the world” dis-

courages a person from looking at
his immediate situation. Probably we
can't do anything to improve “the
world,” but most of us walk or drive
to school through a “world” that
offers much of the material needed to
give college education direction and
purpose.

That “world” is the Lexington com-
munity, and most of us ignore if
entirely or laugh at it. But no one
at WAL has a right to feel patroniz-
ine about Lexington. The people of
the non-university sections of town
live with daily awareness and practi-
cal knowledge of issues about which
we are for all practical purposes
ignorant and backward.

The Lexington community offers us
the chance to see and possibly in-

are becoming crucial to this country’s
life—especially in matters of race,
education, housing, and employment,
Personal and university involve-
ment in Lexington would help us at
least as much as it would the town,

/on the nature of the subject matter

| velop. One possibility is intensive in-

WEL would employ 12-12-6 short term;

distribution requirements may be relaxed

The faculty Curriculum Committee, under the chairmanship of Prof. Henry S. Roberts,
has released its proposals for curriculum revision to the faculty. The Faculty Dicussion Club
will be revived to discuss the suggestions; appearances will be made by the student Curriculum
Committee members. Then the proposals will be presented to entire faculty for acceptance,
amendment, or rejection at a later meeing. The report to the faculty is published below in

its entirety:

|. Substitution of the Credit for the.

Semester Hour as the Unit of Credit.

This committee recommends that
all catalog course listings and require-
ments be expressed in terms of
CREDITS instead of semester hours.
The committee believes it to be de-
sirable to dissociate the concept of
credit given from the number of class
hours or meetings per week. Indi-
vidual courses might meet various
numbers of times a week depending

and the approach used and quite in-
dependently of the credit given. In
transition from the present system,
the listings of individual courses
would be converted on the basis of 1
semester hour equals 1 CREDIT. |
Instructors would be encouraged to}
reevaluate their courses and = ap-|
proaches to them in the light of
overall curriculum revisions and to
formulate proposals for desirable
changes. Such proposals would then
be subject to the existing system of
review and approval at the levels of
the department, Committee on
Courses and Degrees, and the general
faculty,

Il. The Adoption of a New Calen-
dar for the University.

A. This committee recommends
that the calendar of the College con-
sist of two long terms of 12 weeks
each and a short term of 6 weeks.
The pattern of two long terms and
one short term is increasingly com-
mon but the more usual arrange-
ment is a fall term of 13 weeks, a|
winter term of 4 weeks, and a spring |
term of 13 weeks. The function of |
the short term is to permit valuable |

 

 

educational experiences which can-|
not be accomplished in the usual |
semester format where the student

must divide his time and interest be-
tween several courses. There are many
possibilities which each department
would be asked to explore and de-

dividual or group study or research
on or off the campus. Imaginative
thinking should result in numerous
programs of real value to the indi-
vidual students, the various depart-
ments, and to the University.

A short term of 6 weeks rather
than 4 seems desirable to this com-
mittee. Greater flexibility would be a
major advantage. The committee be-
lieves that for some students it would
be advantageous to be enrolled in a
regular course for the short term
rather than to be engaged in special |
or independent study. Lower level
students may not be prepared to
benefit fully from these special pro-
grams. Others might benefit more by
moving more rapidly into areas of
special interest by taking a regular
course. Student failing a course dur
ing a long term might be able to
repeat the course during the short
term and thus forge ahead without
serious delay, A 6-week term is long}
enough to make it possible to offer
some intensive “summer school” type |
courses, Special programs, especially
those involving travel, would
benefit

B. This committee recommends that
the sequence of long and shori terms
be as follows

1. A fall term of 12 weeks be
ginning in September and ending,
including exams, before Chrisimas

2. A winter term of 12 weeks be
ginning immediately after Christmas
with final examinations completed be
fore spring holidays, about the first
week of April

1. A spring term of six weeks end
ing about the last of May

 

also

In this proposal the short term has
been placed at the end of the year
for the following reasons:

1. Year especially courses
such an introductory language and
mathematics, could be scheduled with

courses

, middle of a 30-week year might have

during the better weather conditions
of the spring term.

3. Special intensive study or re-
search programs could be continued
into the summer with only minor
interruption at the end of the aca-
demic year.

4. Students interested in moving
more rapidly into an area of special
interest could enroll in a more ad-
vanced course during the short term.

5. Students failing a course dur-
ing either long term might be able
to repeat the course during the short
term and thus be prepared to con-
tinue without interruption the fol-
lowing year.

There are also arguments in favor
of placing the short term immediately
after Christmas.

1. Having an 8-week interval in the

the desirable effect of providing a
break in the usual class routine and
result in the students approaching the

 

work of the rest of the year with

renewed energy and enthusiasm.

2. Certain types of special study
could be carried on only during the
middle of the year.

3. Special work carried on during
the 6-week term could, if unforeseen
events interferred, be completed under
supervision during the following long
term.

4. The majority of schools have
the winter short term and this sequ-
ence would make co-operative ar-
rangements more feasible. Admini-
Strative difficulties under either plan
would have to be resolved.

Il. Graduation Requirements and
Course Loads,

This committee recommends the
following changes from existing re-
quirements:

1. A total of 108 CREDITS would
be required for graduation. This
would make the normal student load
in any one term 4 courses instead of

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Dormitories and W&L’s future

This weekend, for the first time ever, freshmen at the Uni-
versity of Virginia were permitted to have women in their
dormitory rooms, on a very liberal basis. Outside of the normal
restrictions against noise, destruction, and so forth, the only
condition was that the parietal hours be rigidly observed (Fri-
day, 4 p.m. to 3 a.m.; Saturday, 11 a.m. to 3 a.m.; Sunday,
11 am. to 8 p.m.). The action came as a result of student
petition through normal channels—which in this case at Vir-
ginia does not include the faculty—and approval by President
Shannon and the Dean of Students. President Shannon em-
phasized that the freedom was on trial this weekend:

“No amount of external supervision will guarantee the success of the
parietal regulations as temporarily established for this weekend, or as they
shall be permanently established for the future. It cannot be stressed
enough that the ultimate success or failure of this system will be determined
by ... the First-Year Residents.”

Is this recent action at Virginia relevant to Washington
and Lee? We think so. Though not among a small minority,
W&L is nevertheless one of a decreasing number of universi-
ties (especially private) which do not allow women in men’s
dormitories. And there are good reasons for this—higher
education in the United States has long been steeped in the
traditional in loco parentis approach, which reasons “After
all, yould your parents allow you to entertain women in your
bedroom at home?” Of course not. What is being questioned
now is not the morality of allowing women in men’s bed-
rooms, but rather the comparison of pre-college life at home
with the free, on-your-own life in college.

We tend to view the comparison as invalid. For one thing,
it seems a rather incongruous stand for W&L staunchly to
deny parietals in the dormitories while turning a completely
blind eye toward the hundreds of student apartments. (The
same applies to the fraternity houses, as Reeve Kelsey has
tried to point out on numerous occasions.) The comparison
loses even more validity as the future of W&L is contemplat-
ed. Although it is often absurd to be fatalistic on any issue, it
cannot be denied that if W&L is to continue its prestigious
position (or improve it) among American universities, central
living facilities for all students is the number one priority.
Intellectual atmosphere at W&L is so void as to be negative,
which situation will not be remedied by gymnasium additions,
new academic buildings, a hundred thousand new books in
the library, or Premier Kosygin for Contact. Atmosphere is
a product of environment, and in order for W&L to generate
the intellectual atmosphere so important today in complement-
ing formal education, dormitories for all is the only solution.

This year, as two years ago when the Executive Committee
recommended sophomore dormitories, such a suggestion is
viewed with alarm—and justifiably so. Few W&L students
have been exposed to pleasant dormitory life, such as the
terraced, air-conditioned two- and three-man suites at Bowdoin
(which, incidentally, have been credited to a large degree with
regaining for Bowdoin the national prestige it once was on the
verge of forfeiting at the mercy of the apartment syndrome).

It should be obvious at this point that we are not talking
about the kind of dormitories W&L provides. But even aside
from the abominable physical condition of the structures,
there are constructive measures that could be taken to entice
freshmen to center more of their life in the dormitories, to
prepare the groundwork for student acceptance of required
dormitory residence, and ultimately to increase the interplay
among ideas and people, which is such an important aspect of
life everywhere except in many colleges (including W&L).

The two currently possible measures that immediately
come to mind are the establishment of liberal parictals and
the abolishment of restrictions against liquor in the dormi-
tories. But these measures can only preface the necessity of
building central living facilities for all students. We do not
wish to be so presumptuous as to accompany our views with
the sound of trumpets warning of imminent doom, but never-
theless—if it is to remain within the echelon of proud uni-
versities—Washington and Lee must begin by discarding the
outmoded tenets of in loco parentis or continue to find itself

providing mere instruction im loco education.

Keep distribution requirements

As we noted last week in publishing our faculty survey,
interpreting the results of polls is an imprecise series of un-
provable assumptions. We are nevertheless about to make
some observations on Jeff Spence’s poll in last Friday's edition.
To a slanted question “Do you think our present curriculum
has relevance to society?”, the majority of those polled answer-
ed “no.” To the question “Do you favor a choice of several
courses in different fields to fullfill requirements?”, the
response was overwhelmingly “yes.” It hardly takes a seasoned
pol to see the confusion. In simple terms, students would
like to choose among several fields, as long as the choice
of fields is theirs.

This is one instance in which we genuinely hope the
faculty will toke the student's opinion with an enormous grain
of salt. This editor was not alone in laboring through required
courses whose subject matter he had no desire at all to learn.
But is this inappropriate to higher education? We don’t think
so. Were the choice the students’, Washington and Lee would
become a small independent men’s trade school nestled in the
foothills of the Alleghenies.

This is not to say that the present system of distribution
requirements at W&L is good. It’s not. But in its evaluation
of the requirements and the proposals of the faculty Cur-
riculum Committee, hopefully the faculty will resolve the in-
equities as well as ensure each student a liberal arts education,
whether he wants it or not.

Sounding off...

By ROY CARLTON
Editorial-Page Editor

The waves of discontent that have
been sweeping over this country for
years are finally reaching Washington
and Lee. Despite the University’s at-
tempts to shut itself off from the
rest of the world, the message is now
reaching the W&L student, “Things
have got to change.”

While it’s true that this school can
no longer resist the forces of change
completely, some careful attention
should be given as to what changes
are made and how fast they are placed
in operation. The present student gen-
eration has been misdirected into
thinking that all change is good as
long as it changes. Nothing could
be further from the truth, and yet,
because of its long resistance to any
kind of reforms, W&L may very well
find itself discarding many of its
virtues in a furious attempt to make
up for the past. That would be
tragic, and might very well spell the
end of the University.

Washington and Lee has always
been a school for gentlemen, con-
servative to be sure, and always
conscious of General Lee’s memory.
As one of the few remaining out-
posts of conservatism in the nation,
Washington and Lee survives because
it appeals to such students and gives
them a refuge away from the Anti-
ochs, Benningtons, Berkeleys, and
now, Dukes. Were W&L liberalized
it is unlikely that it would be able
to syphon off enough of the good
liberal students to make up for its
loss of conservative ones. And it
would disturb the alumni.

Laugh all you want to, but the
alumni are an integral part of this
or any other university. And in a few
years you will be alumni. W&L will

 

be associated with your name and
you are just conservative enough to
want to be proud of it as it is now.

The conservatism of the W&L stu-

dent is a well established fact. It
is blared forth from such varied
sources as the DAR and _ Jack

Horowitz. Quite illogically, though,
the liberals on this campus claim that
because W&L is conservative (i.e. ‘It
just isn’t happening here’) the stu-
dents should revolt and liberalize it.
But the students are conservative, De-
spite the monstrous academic ques-
tions the University is presently apply-
ing itself to, the W&L man is still
thinking in terms of getting a ride
for his date from Hollins.

True, students here must be arous-
ed. But it is from apathy that they
must be roused and not conservatism.
Conservatism itself is not a bad thing.
Apathy is the problem, the kind of
apathy that prompts the W&L student
to want a short term because it
sounds like a six week vacation,

This has been a year of unprece-
dented change at this University. A
five-day week has been instituted,
pass-fail may be broadened, a short
term may come to pass, and distribu-
tion requirements are under review.
These are vital questions at Washing-
ton and Lee. The very fact that these
changes are being considered and
passed gives substance to the argu-
ment that it is not necessary to tear
down the school in order to reform it.

It is a very democratic libertarian
thing to say that we deserve our
rights, that the faculty has no author-
ity to stand in the way of the EC’s
resolutions, and that the Honor Trial
is the Washington and Lee version
of a Mississippi lynch mob. But these
things just aren't necessarily  state-
ments of fact because they sound
nice.

 

Conservatism versus change

The faculty, many of whom are
more liberal than the students, are
in accord with the general student
feeling that curriculum changes are
in order. They are sensitive to student
opinion, as was shown in last week’s
survey, and they have been through
the academic treadmill a lot longer
than we have. This is not just an
empty statement. It is evidenced by
the fact that almost everyone on
the faculty wants to change the pres-
ent grading system. The reason it
has not been done is that there are
so many alternatives that they have
come up with. They are a constructive
group on this campus, seeking to
change things by substituting some-
thing better, but only with something
better.

Of late, however ,the Honor Trial
has been the favorite whipping boy
of the vocal minority. It is charged
that by the EC’s secretive methods,
hundreds of students have been haul-
ed off in the middle of the night
and been forced to withdraw from
the University. But if the EC is so
tyrannical, why is it that so few
convicted students have chosen to
exercise their right of appeal? The
only conclusion must be that they
are guilty. Or else they don’t care
enough about the school to want to
stay, in which case their loss is
something short of tragic.

Should W&L liberalize over the
span of time, that is one thing. The
school will have had time to consider
and digest numerous proposals, and
it will hopefully accept only the bet-
ter ones. Change for the sake of
change, however, is destructive. It
has ruined St. John’s. It has de-
stroyed the image of Berkley to any-
one who might give money, includ-
ing the Regents. But at Washington
and Lee it would do its worst.

 

From the J-S...

By LAURENCE M. HILLIARD
Columnist

Will the administration treat its
students as men or teenagers? That
is the question at college campuses
across the country. Fortunately the
trend at Washington and Lee is
toward more responsibility for the
student.

This was not always the case.
Charles McDowell, Class of 1949 and
the Washington correspondent for the
Richmond Times-Dispatch, said the
administration treated the postwar
students, many veterans in their mid-
twenties, like school schildren. Twen-
ty-seven student demands were pre-
sented to President Gaines. Accord-
ing to McDowell, about twenty were
accepted.

The current administration treats
the student body like adults—mest
of the time. Bui the exceptions are
glaring.

lo begin with, consider the ODK
assembly last Friday. A required as-
sembly for college students? Ridicul-
ous! Not at WAL. So everyone has
to troop over to Doremus Gym-
nasium to hear “one of the nation’s
foremost educators” who regrettably
will no longer be among the academic
community because he has sold to

 

the Establishment. Judging by all the
empty seats, a sizable number of
students decided to pay the $2 fine
rather than hear the speech. Those
who heard the speech probably wish
they had made the same decision.
Let's leave required assemblies where
they belong—in high school.

The results of polls printed in the
last two Phis are encouraging. A ma-
jority of faculty members answering
favored extending the pass/fail idea
to the lower classes, and an almost
equal number favored increasing the
courses that can be taken pass/fail.
The students are overwhelmingly in
favor of an independent study course.
Both ideas have merit and deserve
consideration.

One pass/fail course for second
semester freshmen and sophomores
and two for juniors and seniors in
courses not necessary for graduation
would broaden the student's scope of
subjects able to be taken purely for
personal enjoyment and enlighten-
ment.

Unlimited cuts should also be ex-
tended to second semester freshmen
and sophomores. After a semester of
college, a student should be mature
enough to decide for himself how
often to attend classes, and nothing
more need be said on the subject.

 

Maturity rates responsibility

Independent study is one of the
best ideas conceived at W&L in many
a year. An independent study would
be an excellent chance for a junior
or senior to work on a project rele-
vant to his major. The student could
work out his topic with the head of
the department. As a suggestion, a
sociology major could spend the time
in Harlem and a geology major could
do field research. As a journalism
major, | would benefit from spending
the time working for a newspaper or
wire service. The horizons are limit-
less if the student is willing to work
seriously on an independent study,
and I'm sure that most students would
if they choose an interesting subject.

However, the Ring-tum Phi plan of
12-6-12 week schedule stands little
chance of faculty acceptance. The
faculty would consider it too much
time from classes, and some students
would spend the first four weeks lying
on the sands of Fort Lauderdale. A
13-4-13 week schedule would have a
much better chance of being accepted
by the faculty, and would give ade-
quate time for a project. Acceptance
of the independent study would show
that the faculty and administration
accept the student's status as a fully
mature adult.

 

On the inside...

By JACK HOROWITZ
Columnist
It is so easy to point your finger
and say that something is bad, And

 

when you write a newspaper column
| that people read it becomes easier.

| Finger pointing is what white lib-
erals did to the South in the early
| ‘60s. “The South treats Blacks un-
| fairly.” they eried out with moral
certitude. For most of these criers,
the isstie was cut and dry: discrimina-
tion was evil. The liberals believed
they were fighting the injustice of
| this evil by speaking out, Very nice,
admirable, | say. Bul you know
what else—objective judgment fe-
quires detachment. And

 

with objectivity. Too close; cannot
be detached. Hts easier to find evil
far away, Use geography to force
detachment. And more: it doesn't cost
you as much when your neighbor's
house has to be rebuilt

The result of the finger pointing
of eight years ago is that it took
all of those years before a more
valid judgement finally surfaced. Only
in 1968 were whites finally told
straight out that their entire society
was racist. The interval between finger
pointing and trath was costly, It cost

 

it's sort of

difficult to look at your own house | '
‘in the secrecy

a hell of a lot of America’s dignity.

The stock of dignity—public and
personal—remaining for we Ameri-
cans and our country is a difficult
bit of data to calculate, But it is not
hard to see that much has been lost
and when the remainder follows we
will find ourselves collectively suck-
ing on a length of rubber hose con-
nected to destiny’s exhaust.

In simple economics, we cannot
afford the self protecting delusions
of finger pointing any longer. And
it’s finger pointing to say that Wash-

Letters
To the Editor

Student attacks columnists

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

| would like to join the ranks of
the distinguished staff of the Ring-
tum Phi, and follow in the foot-
steps of one of the paper's outstand-
ing columnists—that — self-righteous
critic of “that self-righteous defender
of American patriotism (heaven for-
bid)—the D.A.R.” If I can join, I
will be only two steps behind that
great savior of mankind and enemy
of barbers who is “on the inside.”

My idol laments the fact that the
student body at the only 220-year-old
university in Lexington, Virginia,
does not represent a true cross-section
of the American people. | agree com-
pletely and appreciate his humility,
The percentage of students who re-
ceive financial aid here is actually
greater than the percentage of
Americans who receive welfare. The
admissions office should indeed be
more selective and should reassess its
policies in order to admit more who
do not have to worry about any-
thing but earthshaking affairs such
as whether to cut or not, The Hill
should realize that America is indeed
affluent, and = will always remain
affluent if our parents will just leave
us alone and send checks,

Students, especially —_ freshmen,
should take control of every facet
of life at W&L. We need experience
in running the world we soon will
take over. This suggestion is not en-
tirely original, and W&L will not be
the first institution to have such a
program. For example the upperclass-
men at V.M.I. seem to run their
school satisfactorily. As a matter of
fact, the cadets run it so efficiently
that each one has at least 3 hours a
day to devote to superfluous practices
such as studying. While the freshmen
at V.M.I. do not actively participate
in the running of the school, they
quickly learn to appreciate the ma-
turity of their elders (as do pledges
in W&L fraternities).

Since we are braying about every
atrocity on campus, we might as well
get our licks at those silly people who
speak at W&L about topics which
we intellectual activists do not quite
appreciate. What in the h--- are
scientists doing speaking at a liberal
arts university? Two distinguished
physicists in one week! What is a
radical to do?

I cannot quote my impressive sta-
tistics such as 99 percent to 1 per
cent or 614 to 714, but I can do the
next best thing and make some gentle-
manly radical proposals for bettering
our campus. For one, W&L should

W&L downs Centre in first game
but loses in finals to Southwestern

Washington and Lee’s initial game
of the College Athletic Conference
Basketball Tournament turned out to
be a relatively easy win. The Generals
outplayed the Praying Colonels from
Centre College by the score of 79-65.
WAL was assured of at least second
place as they advanced to the champ-
ionship game.

Neer and Cartwright each had
plenty of trouble in the foul depart-
ment. Both left the game with more
than eight minutes left on the clock,
but not before contributing a great
deal toward Washington and Lee's
win, “Magic” Mel Cartwright hit a
hot streak right after the second half
starter and finished the contest with

2 points. And lean and mean Mike
Sane controlled the back board jungle
once again.

But Southwestern was our tough-
est foe as the Generals had predicted.
In the finals the Lynx from South-
western proved a little too tough as

they defeated Washington and Lee,|*

73-55.
Washington and Lee was in trouble

 

 

 

 

 

from the first minute of the champ-
ionship game. Four fouls were called
on three starters before the half. The
Generals were never able to over-
come the early lead Southwestern
took.

One of the brightest aspects of the
game for Washington and Lee was the
outstanding play of Mike Daniel.
Daniel played his second straight out-
standing game as he was high scorer
in the finals with 16 points. In addi-
tion Mel Cartwright played impres-
sively enough to make the All-Con-
ference team for the second time in
three years. —John Robinson

After an almost successful come-
back after being down to Sewanee
by 26 points, the W&L swimming
team settled for a second in the
C.A.C, championship. The Blue, how-
ever, cracked 6 C.A.C. records and
set I! new school records.

Leading the assault on the record
book was Billy Ball who captured
his third consecutive Outstanding
Swimmer Award. For his effort he
won the 100 backstroke, 200 back-
stroke, 200 individual medley and led
off the winning 400 yard medley relay.
He set new C.A.C, championship
records in the 100 and 200 yard
backstroke (56.9 and 2:07.9) and the
200 individual medley (2:10.3) (mostly
breaking those he already held) and
the medley relay set a new C.A.C.
record.

Assisting in the attack was William

the EC would take a final vote. The
jurisdiction sub-committee, headed by
Danny Leonard, is taking two separate
routes in trying to simplify the honor
system,

A random survey is being taken to
determine where students believe the
jurisdictional limits lie; and Leonard
is conferring with the various depart-
ments in trying to draw up guidelines
for freshmen on the format of “Writ-
ten Work and The Honor System at
Washington and Lee.”

Leonard’s task met with opposition
from Dean of Students Atwood, who
feared Leonard was going to codify
the system (Leonard denied this) and
from Steve Sandler, who was afraid

that this might also be the case. Pete

Curriculum proposals readied for debate by faculty

(Continued from Page 1)

5. Our intent is to encourage the
student to achieve greater involve-
ment in those courses which he does
undertake. Instructors should be able
to provide greater depth and to ex-
pect a corresponding response from
students.

The achievement tests referred to
in IV-4 would not give credit toward
this requirement but credit could be
obtained, as at present, on the Na-
tional Advanced Placement Program.

2. 12-Week Terms,

The normal and minimum load
without special permission would be
12 CREDITS. The maximum load
without special permission would be
14 CREDITS.

3, 6-Week Term.

The normal and minimum load
without special permission would be
3 CREDITS with a permissible maxi-
mum of 6 CREDITS, or the equi-
valent in special studies, without
special permission.

4. All students would be required |
to register for all 3 terms.

1V. Distribution Requirements,

No area has caused this committee
more difficulty. We agree that some
distribution requirements are desir-|
able if students are to achieve a lib-
eral education characterized by a
variety of approaches to knowledge.
There is general agreement that a
reduction of distribution requirements
is necessary. There are differing opin-
ions, reflecting different philosophies,
to how the reduction should be
achieved and a division among us on
whether breadth, which all of us be-|
lieve desirable, should be encouraged
or required. The majority view is that
breadth in educational experience
should be obtained by requiring that
each graduate have experience and)
achieve minimum competency in sev-
eral broad areas (as evidenced by the
completion of courses or satisfactory
performance on achievement tests)
without specific course requirements,
\ minority, while in agreement with
these general objectives, believes that
certain specifics should be required of
all graduates and would require

broader distribution and experience.
Both majority and minority recom-
mendations are presented for your
consideration. That the two recom-
mendations are as similar as_ they
are reflects the attitude of compromise
which has characterized the delibera-
tions of the committee and also the
belief that the concepts underlying
these recommendations are more im-
portant than the exact modes of
their achievement.

The distribution requirements under
both plans are intended as require-
ments for the B.A. degree and also
the minimum for any other degree
awarded, Departments concerned with
awarding any other degree would
propose any additional requirements
which they feel desirable subject to
the existing system of approval,

striction does not apply in interde-
partmental or independent majors,

c. These requirements should be
completed as soon as possible, pre-
ferably by the end of the Sophomore

subject to the following restrictions:

b. 12 CREDITS in Division I,

ments listed,

c. 10 CREDITS in Division I,
with work taken in at least 2 of the
departments listed,

d. 6 CREDITS in Division IV.

| both distribution and major require-
| ments.

that the requirements listed could be
met by satisfactory performance in
| corresponding subject areas on Ad-
