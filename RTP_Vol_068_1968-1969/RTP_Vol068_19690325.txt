comment for which contributions

By PROF, DELOS D. HUGHES

A case may be made that there is
no appropriate place for grading aca-
demic performance at all, but I do
not wish to argue it. Grading stu-
dents is a practice of long standing
which will certainly stand much
longer yet. The demand for evalua-
tion of faculty is a persistent student
request and it is likely to become
more insistent with time. So long as
we grade student performance, we
ought to do it as well as possible.
So long as the demand for evaluation
of faculty continues, we ought not to
reject the possibility out of hand.

In an academic community, evalua-
tion of the members is bound to be
troublesome. The propriety of grading
students and rating faculty is a sub-
stantial question, But whether or not
grading is intrinsically inimical to
education, there is certainly enormous
difficulty in putting into quantitative
terms (grades) what is essentially
qualititative—how well one is edu-
cated or how well one educates
others. And there are certainly pos-
sible threats to academic freedom
which arise in evaluating faculty per-
formance.

Student interest in rating teaching
skill is understandable. In fact many
faculty members only resist the idea
because they know no way to do a
good job of evaluating such perform-
ance. In teaching and learning, the
criteria for satisfactory accomplish-
ment are hard to agree upon and
harder still to put into a form for
which a satisfactory test can be de-
veloped.

We do now assume that it is pos-
sible to test satisfactorily how much
and how well a student has learned.
The assumption has clear deficiencies,
of course, but if we disregard them in
the interests of improving the exist-
ing system, could we assume that the
performance of the student on ex-
aminations reflects the ability and
energy of his teachers? The answer
clearly is No, and the reason is evi-
dent: the functions of teacher and
examiner are performed by the same
person. It should not require much
exposition for the reader to see the
undesirable ramifications of this ar-
rangement. The desirable reform is

 

‘The way I see it’

(Editor’s note: “The way I see it’ are solicited from students and

faculty concerning any topic.)

nearly self-evident. Let some teach
and others evaluate. With experience
under such an arrangement, norms of
student performance can be used to
evaluate the success of teachers, And
we avoid the anomolous situation of
having a teacher as judge of how
well he himself has taught.

Every objection and weakness that
I can foresee might be charged to
this innovation, save one, can be
charged to the present system, which
does not have the redeeming features
of the reform. The exception is the
economic consideration. Considering,
however, the proportion of faculty
time now occupied by testing, it
should be at least theoretically pos-
sible to accomplish the change with-
out additional expense simply by
specializing functions. Nor should it
matter greatly in terms of expense in-
volved that examiners be brought
from outside our faculty to do the
job. That arrangement in fact would
promote objectivity and our keeping

 

abreast of the standards of the wider
academic community.

It ought to be undisputed that grad-
ing is properly done by a university |
for its own purposes primarily, Wash- |

merits of our grading system there-
fore should be defensible with regard
to the purposes of liberal education
alone. Otherwise we ought to abandon
it.

Reward for accomplishment does
not of itself partake of any educa-
tional qualities that | can observe.
Unless there is an element of in-
centive in the award, no apparent
educational purpose is served, It may
seem fitting to reward what would
have been accomplished without the
anticipation of recognition, but it is
not educational. The educational |
merits of a grading system turn on its |
effectiveness as an incentive, and it
does appear, notwithstanding some |
dispute, that grades are effective in-
centives. For reasons which often have |
nothing to do with future employ-|
ment or graduate school admission, |
students apparently are impelled to}

EC defers vote on jurisdictional limits, okays procedure

Monday holiday
bites the dust

Proposed procedural changes in
the Washington and Lee Honor Code
were approved unanimously last night
by the Executive Committee, but a
proposal which dealt with the jurisdic-
tional limits of the code was deferred
until a meeting after spring vacation
The commitice also heard Jay Pas-
savant announce that the Faculty
Executive Committee had rejected a
request for the cancellation of April
7 classes. The committee reasoned
that 1) students would have no dif-
ficulty returning and 2) the committee
was reluctant to act on schedule
changes without faculty's opinions
being heard.

The EC's decision to postpone vot-
ing on the jurisdictional limits of the
Honor Code was prompted by a con-
troversy over where the code should
apply. Danny Leonard, chairman of
the committee on jurisdictional limits
for the Honor Code, advocated that
the code be enforced only within the
limits of the University. It was argu
ed, however, that a system which set |
such limits might undermine any at-|
tempts to instill honor in WAL stu-|
dents and thus be self-defeating |

Steve Sandler offered a proposal
which would settle the question of
jurisdictional limits by requiring the |
EC to consider any case brought!
before it. In this way the place of |
the offense would not determine if}
the cause came under the Honor Code’s
jurisdiction |

W&L swimmers Billy Ball

and Bill Brumback earned All-

America status for their excellent performances in the College
National Swimming Championships last weekend at Spring-
field College. Brumback finished 6th in the 50 yard freestyle,
while Ball scored 6th in the 100 yard backstroke and a 9th

in the 200 yard backstroke.

The W&L swimmers scored a total*¥——

of 22 points which boosted W&L into
17th place out of the 72 colleges
represented at the meet. The meet
was won by the University of Cali-
fornia at Irvine,

In the preliminary trials Brumback
qualified 2nd with a time of 22.2
seconds. In the finals he dropped to
6th place with a time of 22.3 seconds.
Ball qualified Sth in the 100 yard
backstroke with a time of 57.8 sec-
onds, and dropped to 6th in the
finals, while lowering his time to 57.5
seconds.

Ball also finished 9th in the 200
yard backstroke with a time of 2:08.5
seconds; any swimmer who finishes in
the top 12 places is awarded All-
status, Freshman John
Lawlor and Bib Clark also traveled
to Springfield and participated in a
400 yard medley relay.

Coach Stearns, a graduate of
Springfield College, enjoyed the re-
turn especially with the triumph of
Ball and Brumback. The Springfield
pool is one of the newest and most
modern in America. It is equipped
with movable bulkheads so the pool
can be adjusted to any length from
50 meters to 23% yards.

The Springfield pool is also equip-
ped with automatic timers which time
to one-hundredth of a second which
was the downfall of Brumback in the
100 yard freestyle. Brumback qualifi-
ed 13th with a time of 49.79 seconds
and 12th place went to a time of
49.76 seconds.

Coach Stearns said he was excep-

tionally pleased with Brumback’s
times as they are the best of his
winning swimming career at WAL.

In the last two seasons of competi-
tion he has lost only one freestyle
sprint (SO and 100 yards). Coach
Stearns was appreciative that the Uni-
versity allowed Ball, Brumback,
Clark, and Lawlor to participate in
the college championships.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Some thoughts on the jurisdictional dilemma of honor

This year the Executive Committee has been forced to
take into consideration two events which raised serious ques-
tions concerning the procedure of honor trials and the jurisdic-
tional limits of the system itself. On the one hand, President
Jay Passavant and Law School representative Pete Hendricks,
two of the EC’s best three, have dealt with the procedural
issues in superb fashion, On the other hand, Vice-President
Danny Leonard has endorsed a jurisdictional provision which,
if adopted by the EC, would bastardize any semblance of
honor in the Honor System.

As we said, the Executive Committee has done a thorough
and competent job in its analysis of Honor System procedural
questions, allowing moderate changes to be implemented which
1) guarantee the student a fairer trial, as he may face his
accusers and ask questions of any witness and 2) insure the
EC’s ability to conduct a public trial on a basis consistent with
private trials.

Leonard’s proposal

Danny Leonard discussed jurisdictional limits at length
with professors in every department of the University and
has, we are certain, devoted a great deal of thought to this
question. In his report to the Executive Committee, he ac-
knowledged two limits of the Honor System:

1) The scope of the Honor System shall include all instances of
lying, cheating, and stealing by a person assumed to be a student at
Washington and Lee University. In such instances, both the nature of the
offense and the motives of the accused shall be taken into consideraion.

2) The scope of the Honor System shall include all instances of
lying, cheating, and stealing that develop on property falling under the
jurisdiction of Washington and Lee University or in conjunction with
any University function or activity.

The first of these is dismissed by Mr. Leonard as maintain-
ing “too many gray areas” in a system which could “call
for holding a boy responsible to the Honor System for some-
thing he has done, yet the Student Body and the EC might
not consider that act dishonorable.”’ In defense of the second,
limited jurisdiction, Mr. Leonard said, “Our system can only
realistically apply itself to the W&L community,” which he
interprets as W&L property in most instances.

Implicit codification

At last Wednesday’s “Bitch-in” one student commented if
Mr. Leonard’s proposal is accepted, we would have a situation
of “on-campus gentlemen and out-of-town thieves.” Perhaps;
perhaps not. But the possibility is there; Washington and Lee’s
Honor System would be relegated to a standard of conduct
applicable only to the campus—which is, in our opinion,
implicit codification.

The results could portend a pathetic comedy of errors
for the tradition of honor. A student could steal records from
an apartment, forge a check to a local merchant, lie to Uni-
versity proctor Bob Murray at a fraternity house, or cheat
on the Civil Service Examination at the Post Office and would
not be held responsible under the Honor System.

The realm of interpretation

What is involved here is not the discovery of a new, cure-
all code. We don’t need one. Mr. Leonard talks about gray
areas—fine! If you get rid of the uncertain fringe, then you
have a codified set of rules whose tautness and complexity
form a mesh oblivious to interpretation.

And interpretation of the Honor System is the very rea-
son we, as students, allow the EC to function as an honor
court. Twelve men are elected to defend the tradition of honor
at this University and, as a necessary adjunct of that responsi-
bility, to decide, after weighing facts and circumstances, the
applicability of honor’s guidelines against lying, cheating, and

stealing.
“Gentlemen”?

When this edition faced off with the EC earlier this
year, it was not a question of improper jurisdictional limits
but rather that we felt the limits were improperly applied. This
is a question of interpretation.

And what makes Washington and Lee’s Honor System
what it is—one of the best—is that there is room for interpre-
tation. Thus the clearest admonition that can be given any
student is simply “be a gentleman; and gentlemen do not
lie, cheat, or steal.”’ If any of us is so unaware that he cannot
decide for himself what this admonition means, then it is
entirely possible he will at some time be asked to withdraw.
And the beauty of interpretation is that if he commits a
violation, every opportunity is given to justify it; there are
no hard and fast rules.

Mr. Leonard's proposal would totally negate our right to
the use of the word “gentleman.” We would, in effect, be
condoning unethical conduct everywhere except on campus.
And quite another disturbing aspect of this is that three other
members of the EC, as well as about half of the students
present when a straw vote was taken at the “Bitch-in,” are in
favor of the second proposal.

A decision of honor

We are a closed, selective community
surveyed, physical limits but in terms of the type of person
who is allowed to remain among us. And as such we need
not observe arbitrary legal procedure or limits, as Bill Walker
and Jack Horowitz suggest.

Washington and Lee wants to graduate men of character
and integrity, men who don’t need (or want) to be told where
they may lie, cheat, or steal and where they may not do so. In
most cases, W&L’s students know. In those instances of un-
certainly, it is the mark of honor for a student to decide for
himself what is right and what is not right.

not in terms of

Temperance ys, exactitude
Those who are in favor of strict adherence to legal pro-
cedure are, we fear, afraid to place their faith in the good

intentions of the Honor System. But they neglect to realize
that these essentially “free” legal trappings we enjoy have
allowed the necessary temperance which consistently refuses to
convict an innocent person, whereas diligent legalities may
lead to an inherent unfairness.

And those who are searching for exact jurisdictional speci-
fications refuse to acknowledge the EC’s ability to interpret,
and then go on to condone certain dishonorable situations by
implication.

Vote tomorrow!

The Executive Committee will present for a vote by the
student body tomorrow its amendments to the constitution.
These amendments involve reshaping election procedure so
that it is more flexible and fair and several minor but wholly
necessary deletions and additions to bring the constitution
up to date.

In the past, constitutional amendments have not fared
well—even when needed—because of a lack of voter turnout.
Although these amendments are not earthshaking and do not
lend themselves to lively discussion, we urge everyone to vote
tomorrow so that the new provisions can go into effect
immediately.

Staff editorial

In defense of tribunals

We would like to take issue with many of the arguments
and assumptions inherent in Bill Walker’s criticism of the
Honor System in last Friday’s Ring-tum Phi. The basic issue
is whether the Honor System is basically a set of laws and
therefore subject to the structures and conventions of the
— legal system or whether it is something quite dif.
erent.

The Honor System is a privilege that has been won by
the last hundred years of W&L students and is endowed with
something much more significant than the mere force of law.
The EC and its methods of the secret honor trial have evolved
with the Honor System according to the demands of the
System. Therefore, we feel that the basic framework of the
honor trial are those that are best suited for the Honor System

at W&L.

 

Unchecked power?

The EC is rebuked for not limiting its own “awesome and
unchecked power.’ The EC’s power is certainly awesome, but
it can hardly be described as unchecked. The basic check is
the public honor trial and every EC member comes up for
election yearly which is a secondary check on any aribitrary
EC action.

The EC makes every human effort to decide whether a
person is guilty or not. A former EC member stated that he
would rather 100 violators remained on campus than one
innocent student be convicted. Many other EC members
voice similar sentiments. Mr. Walker’s statement that “it is
apparently fele that all precautions must be taken to insure
that no gulity party be allowed to escape retribution and
exile” is far from the actual truth. The majority of the EC
convictions in recent years have all been due to open and shut
cases of plagiarism or theft. Conviction involving the judg-
ment of the EC where the proof of the crime is not absolute
are few and far between.

Tribunal vs. adversary

Mr. Walker, in defense of the adversary system, states
that this system would prevent “giving all the advantages to
the prosecution, the law, as the Committee seems to favor.”
This assumes that the EC during an honor trial views itself
as the prosecution. No one on the EC is out to prosecute or
“get” the accused. They are objectively attempting to de-
termine guilt or innocence. The tribunal system, although not
used extensively in the United States courts, is a valid court
system and is an acceptable alternative to the adversary system.
In the case of the Honor System, the merits of the tribunal sys-
tem far outweigh those of the adversary system,

The adversary system would in the long run work to the
benefit of the prosecutor as we argued in an earlier editorial.
It would require the EC to set aside one or more of its mem-
bers as prosecutor; most ideally this should be the senior law
representative, unless the EC chose to create a new elective
office of EC “DA” whose only function would be to convict as
many people as he could. The adversary system implies that
there will be someone trying his best to convict the accused
regardless of guilt or innonce.

Little would be gained

The remainder of the EC would then have to act as jury
and would they be able to ask questions to satisfy their own
judgments? Mr. Walker states that the jury in a public honor
trial should not be able to ask questions (and rightly so) ;
then should those members of the EC be able to ask questions?
Finally what will be the level of competence of that student
selected as defense attorney? Will the defense attorney, unless
a law student, have the competence to equal the experienced
EC prosecutor? And how many undergraduates know law stu-
dents well enough to depend upon them entirely in an honor
trial?

We feel that the present system has more than enough
safeguards to protect an innocent student and is not this
justice? The procedural and theoretical changes needed to
convert to the adversary system could very seriously weaken the
Honor System while adding so very little to the accused's
rights that it is not in the best interest of the Honor System

 

and the student body to make this change. —R.W.K.

 

Party shifts caused
end of clique power

Second of two parts

By ROY CARLTON
Editorial-Page Editor

The political rupture in W&L
campus politics in the spring of 1963
marked the beginning of the end for
the political party at W&L. The key
to parties had always been tradition.
Now, with the breaking of the old
bonds, the various house politicos
found it somewhat difficult to forge
new ones.

Spring election marked the first
time in decades in which Red Square
had been split. The new Progressive
and University parties found them-
selves being led by the leaders of
the old University party. Most signifi-
cant, though, was the division of nine
houses into each party which guaran-
teed the prospect of a close two-party
election.

The spring contests also marked
the first time that the University’s
two biggest political houses were fac-
ing each other: Sigma Alpha Epsilon
was Progressive while Beta Theta
Pi led the new University party. Not
surprisingly, it was these two houses
which supplied their party's Presi-
dential nominee.

In a close hard-fought election in
which the Independent Union offici-
ally endorsed the Progressive slate,
Bill Noell, the Progressive candidate
squeezed out Buck Ogilvie of the
University party. Each party found
itself well represented within the new
EC, and it appeared as if the turmoil
was going to die.

Not for long. After an uneventful
Freshman election in the fall in
which the Progressives captured the
EC seat, party unrest began to re-
appear. Once again it was Sigma
Phi Epsilon, this time in conjunction
with Delta Tau Delta, who upset the
balance of power. While both houses
sent representatives to the Progressive
nominating caucus, they sent a sec-
ond team of representatives to the
University caucus which took place
the same night. The houses finally
switched their allegiance upon the
University party nomination of a
SPE for Secretary. The stunned Pro-
gressives didn't learn of the ma-
nuever, which left them with only
seven houses, until the next day.

In the subsequent student body and
class elections, the University party
with its large majority won an over-
whelming share of races. Yet almost
immediately after the elections, the
new University party ran into the
problems the old University party had
run into. The clique was too un-
wieldy. The party dissolved, and a
new party, the Liberty party, was
formed. The Liberty party ran along
the same lines as the old University
party, and once again united the Red
Square houses. Sigma Chi pledged
itself to neutrality, and the Progres-
sive party with only seven houses re-
mained a minority.

The most severe crisis and the
critical blow to the party system
came in the Freshman EC elections
the following fall. The Ring-tum Phi
took a preferential poll of the fresh-
man class just before the nominating
caucuses. Steve Saunders of ZBT
was chosen as the most qualified
freshman for the EC by a substantial
margin. Second was Jody Kline of
Phi Kap, third was John Reynolds
of Sigma Chi, and fourth was Rich-
ard Nash, a Beta.

The Liberty party was the first to
nominate a candidate with Jody Kline.
Yet only two days later, shock waves
rolled across campus when nine
houses abandoned the Liberty and
Progressive parties to form a new
University party. The action left the
Liberty party, which had yet to face
an election, with only four houses,
and the Progressive party with only
two. Three houses were independent,

The selection of Richard Nash as
University party nominee left him as
the only candidate with solid party
backing. In the next few days the
Liberty and Progressive parties dis-
solved, leaving only the one party.
Jody Kline, Steve Saunders, Joe Mat-
thews, and John Reynolds were nomi-
nated as independent candidates,

This was the first multi-candidate
race in years. If the University party
lost, it might well spell the end of
party politics. A majority was need-
ed for election. If a majority didn't
exist, a run-off between the two lead.
ing primary candidates would decide
the winner.

After a furious campaign, the in-
dependenis managed to prevent 4
party majority. Though it won a
plurality, Nash was forced to run
against Saunders in a second ballot,
Despite the significance of the issues,
voter apathy ran high. Abstentions
might just have swung the election as
Nash won by only five votes: 146-

141. The clique had survived, but it
had hardly received a hearty en-
dorsement.

The last party election was held
the following spring. The University

 

party slate faced only one serious
opponent, Independent candidates for
Vice-President and Secretary were
submitted at the last minute. Yet
Fred Mindel of ZBYT waged a hard
fight for the Presidency against party
candidate Chuck Walker of Kappa
Sig. The result was a landslide vote
for Mindel as voters repudiated the
clique. Following the Big Four elc-
tions the University party officially
disbanded, leaving the campus party-
less for the first time within memory.

Party politics has never again rais-
ed its ugly head. With the parties,
big house politics have dissolved too.
Don't let anyone fool you that today’s
elections are clique-run. If they were,
Jeff Wexler would not have polled
200 votes last year.

LETTERS 10 THE EDITOR

Intolerable situation

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:
Wednesday night I attended the

“Bitch-in” held in Lee Chapel. The

session proved very interesting and I

came away with new admiration for

the efficiency and dedication of the

 

men who make up our Executive
Committee.
However, there is one issue on

which I feel compelled to comment.
This concerns the jurisdiction of the
Honor System. There is currently a
proposal, being given quite a bit of
support, which would limit the ap-
plication of the Honor System to
events that take place on the campus
itself.

For instance, as was pointed out
at the “Bitch-in,” if a student stole
a bathing suit, lied and cheated on
a weekend visit to Virginia Beach,
he would not, under the new pro-
posal, be guilty of an Honor Viola-
tion,

To me this proposal is unaccept-
able. If it was instituted, | would
have to ask myself if we were
seeking to maintain an honorable stu-
dent body or just an honorable
campus.

Honor is not something that can
be “turned on” one day and “turned
off” the next. Likewise, it is not
something that can be displayed in
one locality and ignored in another.
An honorable person does not per-
form honorably on only a part-time
basis.

Therefore, if we are to continue
our Honor Sysiem, let us refrain
from compromising its integrity,
After all, the purpose of our Honor
System should not be to make
Honor a part of the “school routine,”
it should instead be one of making
Honor a part of every Washington
and Lee man’s life.

Ihe Generals scored 16 runs in
two games to post victories in their
first two outings of the spring cam-
paign, In both cases the scene was
wind swept Liberty Hall Field and
the victim was Cleveland State’s Vik-
ings.

The tally was 6-1 as the varsity
baseballers showed power at the plate
and on the mound in taking Friday’s
game. In the first inning alert base-
running and patience at the plate
contributed the first run to the Gen-
erals’ six run total. In later innings
the home team forced the Vikings
to use two other pitchers,

Co-captain and All-Conference
pitcher Thom Mitchell turned out the
outstanding performance of the after-
noon. Thom hurled for seven full in-
nings giving up only one run and
two hits. Mitchell also did an ex-
cellent job with the bat, going two

for four. Steve “Chief” Mahaffey shut
the door on any Viking aspirations
in the closing inning giving up no
runs and only two hits.

Baserunning was one of the better
points of Washington and Lee’s play.
W&L speedsters stole quite a few
bases. Gil Fitzhugh made the hustl-
ing play of the game reaching third
on a shot to right field.

Aftewards Coach Joe Lyles credited
the victory to, “The will to win—
the boys never let up out there!”

Initially in the contest the Gen-
erals put a whole pile of runners on
but had trouble getting them across
the plate. But the big break in this
streak came when Scott MecChrystal
received two RBI's for a single with
bases jammed. This precendent was
followed in a big eighth inning ex-
plosion which was triggered by hits
from Ray Coats, Jim Wilson and
Thom Mitchell.

Saturday things were a little dif-
ferent as Washington and Lee had
to count on a fine pitching perform-
ance and a big rally to grab a 8-7
come-from-behind win.

At both third base and the batting
box Steve Kalista was turning out
quite a performance. The hustling
junior took hits away from the visitors
through amazing stops and a rifle
arm. And it was Kalista’s hit to
right field that started the rally that
put W&L ahead to stay.

Stickmen suffer a setback

The weather was bad and so was
the first half for W&L’s lacrosse
team in its first match against
Bucknell. Bucknell University shock-
ed the Generals with a tight de-
fense and an aggressive offense and
took a 6-0 lead out with them at
half-time.

But in the second half an inspired
Washington and Lee team scored
four goals and cut the lead down to
two. Scoring for the home squad were
Joe Wich, Whit Morrill, Tom Gro-
ton, and John Thomas. But late in
the game Bucknell scored a pair of
goals to bring the final score to 8-4.

Bucknell’s coach described W&L’s
team as “A fine club which got be-
hind early and couldn't overcome this
early lead. I think the key to Buck-
nell’s win is that we controlled the
ground balls.”

Dick Szlasa stated that, “We fell
behind early, but I was proud that

‘The way I see it’

(Continued from Page D

real learning through fear of failing
or hope of excelling in a formal and
public way.

In common with penal systems,
educational systems are typically based
the efficacy of punishment—its
application, fear of it, and example
of it—for reinforcing learning. While
educational institutions usually place
somewhat greater emphasis on co-
ordinate rewards than do penal insti-
tutions, they are just as firm in stig-
matizing the man who fails to feel
their effect. As a sign of his ultimate
insult to academic pride, the ignorant

| man who enters the university's gates

and remains unaffected is made to
wear his scarlet F, perhaps forever.
The university could make a _ case

that the penalty is merited just be-
cause the ingrate has squandered its
time and resources, Perhaps he has
even denied another the chance to
use these opportunities to better ad-
vantage than he did. But the uni-
versity usually does not make this
case. Its rationale rests on some sacred
theory of education, some idea of
the spur which the hated grade pro-
vides to the sluggish mind and the
rein it puts on frivolous intention,
lhere books full of contrary
opinions about the validity of punitive
educational theories. One's own ex-
perience within academic communi-
ties (and perhaps penal communities)
should afford some insight into their
relative merits, But in the absence of
any consensus among those who are
counted experts in the matter, of
among those who have been directly

are

exposed to the process, there are
some other considerations that we
can examine.

If any store at all is put in being
“sensible” we may ask whether com-
mon supports the of
declaring to the academic community
or to the larger society that a student
has failed to learn a required lesson
The
to hang on a real difference between
the man who has tried without suc-
cess to accomplish some task and the
man who has not tried at all

sense practice

“sensibleness” of doing so seems

| but the failing grade does not reveal
lit. The F tells us that (presumbably)
a student knows nothing about
medieval history—which is just what
we ought to assume if we find no
grade at all for medieval history in
his record. Whether the student who
failed a course is lazy, dull, dis-
tracted, or perverse, his F will not
reveal. But then we cannot assume
that a student who did not take
medieval history is not lazy, or dull,
or distracted, or perverse, for it may
be that one of these is the reason
he did not take the course. Through
the grading arrangements we may be
penalizing academic initiative and re-
warding timidity. It is only sensible
then to record what has been ac-
complished rather than what has not.

Leaving aside the separate matter
of a rationale for distinguishing de-
grees of satisfactory work, the crucial
question is, of course, what is the
effect of eliminating Failure. Super-
ficially the effect is to raise GPR’s,
No other catastrophe is likely to

Lee becomes, in effect, a grant of
permission to use the facilities of
the university for a stated period of
time (8 or 9 semesters, for instance),
contingent upon acquiring academic
competence, as the University cares
to define it, at a prescribed rate. With
this condition, there ought to be no
great difference from the present
situation—except that the incentive to
learning is a carrot and not a stick.

I do not really know how to argue
very closely for the carrot over the
stick, except to state a belief which
seems to be widespread among teach-
recognized stature. The most
effective teaching is accomplished
when the initiative comes from the
student, when his desire to learn pro-
ceeds from his own positive values.
Forced learning is painful to student
and to teacher, it is wasteful, it re-
sults in narrow perspective and failure
of imagination,

So long as we equate grades with
education, the quality of our educa-

 

There may be such a difference,' that is punitive rather than
