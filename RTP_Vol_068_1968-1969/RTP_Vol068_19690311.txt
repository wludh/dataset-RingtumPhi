By JAY PASSAVANT

For the past several weeks, the
Executive Committee has been con-
sidering numerous proposed changes
in your Honor System. The various
proposals lie within both the pro-
cedural and jurisdictional categories
of the system. These changes, if im-
plemented, will make the Honor Sys-
tem at Washington and Lee con
siderably easier for the Executive
Committee and the Student Body to
administer, while at the same time
providing for increased protection for
the accused student, The Executive
Committee feels that it is absolutely
essential for the Student Body to be
entirely cognizant of the proposed
changes. In addition, student partici-
pation in discussing these changes is
strongly encouraged by the E.C.

To date, the sub-committees
on the Honor System have given their
reports, and plans are for the
future. The Procedure
(Hendricks and Passavant) report
appears in its entirity in the March
4th Ring-tum Phi with the modifica-
tions added by the E.C. as a whole
appearing in heavy black ink

Ihe Jurisdictional Committee

Leonard, Simmons, Thompson, and
Kumpuris) appears in today’s Ring-

have gained concensus in the E.C

[he Troubadour’s latest production,
“America Hurrah” can be described
as “unique” and “extremely contro- |
versial.” A satire of American life,
the play will run March 12-15; the
curtain will rise at 8:30,

Ihe play's composition is unique |
} in that it is a series of one-act plays
united by a central theme. The con- |
troversial theme treats the degenera-|

tion of American culture through
three established institutions. The |
|three one-acts entitled “Interview,” |
i P.V.,” and “Motel,” deal with the

unfairness of big business, the waste-
land of American entertainment, and
the cheap, “sleezy” view of sex.
Publicity Director Hugh Hill com-!
mented that while the show does not
portray its attack as graphically as|
“Hair,” it will contain representative |
nudity and experimental techniques.

term,

tables proposals on honor

In the belief that some sort of short
term program is desirable for Wash-
ington and Lee, the Executive Com-
mittee on a motion by Steve Sandler
endorsed the Curriculum Committee's
proposal presented by Swede Henberg
that either arrangement (12-6-12 or
12-12-6) is preferable to the present
university calendar. Although one
plan is not at this moment held in
preference to the other, it should be
understood that the Executive Com-
mittee may, at some future time,
endorse a more specific recommenda-
tion concerning the current curri-
culum proposal. The endorsement
was unanimous with Secretary Judson
Simmons absent.

Joe Tompkins introduced — three
recommendations drafted by himself
and Dean Kumpuris concerning the
co-op and the student union. The EC
unanimously approved these recom-
mendations (discussed on page two
in this paper in an article by
lompkins) which basically deal with
co-op hours, student union jobs, and
a committee of inquiry to study co-
op pricing policies, food, ete.

Danny Leonard, chairman of the
Subcommittee on the Jurisdiction of
the Honor System, read the report
of this group which was debated at
considerable length. The _ report
basically consists of two proposals:
1) The scope of the Honor System
shall include all instances of lying,
cheating, and stealing by a person
assumed to be student at Wash-
ington and Lee. In such instances,
both the nature of the offense and
the motives of the accused shall be

Within the coming week, two noted
personages will speak at Washington
and Lee: Ambler Moss, Special As-
sistant to the American Ambassador
to the OAS, and A. Linwood Holton,
Republican gubernatorial candidate.

Mr. Moss will speak in duPont
Auditorium Tuesday, March 11, at
7:30. He is to speak to the Mock
OAS convention, which is sponsored
by the Model Inter-American Con-
ference of the OAS and the W&L
Young Republican Club.

W&L snubbed
by Rock Queen

After a month of negotiations, the
Dance Board was unable to obtain
the services of folk-singer Judy Col-
lins and has thus cancelled its antici-
pated concert of March 22.

Miss
WA&l

 

Collins refused to come to
for no other reason than that
she “just didn’t want to.” She had
no apparent engagements scheduled
for that date, and a sufficient fee was
offered her, but, as board vice-presi-
dent Dean Kumpuris stated, she still!
did not want to come to WAL.

Kumpuris went on to say that it|
is now too late to schedule any good
entertainment for that date and that
the Board refused to settle for any-
one below the quality of the popular
female vocalist.

The Finals concert will once again
be reinstated to its previous date in
May, so as to give the Board sufficient
time to book a good group. It is
hoped that next year another attempt |
rescheduling this event will be
made and will not be destroyed by
such abrupt action as that of Miss
Collins. Reed Byrum

REVIEW and OUTLOOK
The return of Saturday classes

It could happen.

Soon.

Sentiment is growing among the faculty to re-institute
Saturday classes—not next year, but this year (it could be
effected during Spring Vacation). To most students it should
be surprising that such a move is being considered; but to
the hundred or so who have flagrantly and frequently abused
this favor granted by the faculty, it must seem quite the logical
conclusion.

And after all, the faculty actually was doing the students
a favor. When all the hogwash (in most cases) about “extra
time for research and study” is peeled away, the basic reason
for not having Saturday classes is convenience. By now, it’s
become a different and pleasant way of life.

To most. But not to those professors who teach on Friday
afternoons, not to the visiting lecturers greeted with empty
classrooms, not to the athletic coaches who face diminishing
Friday afternoon practice sessions.

The ace in the hole we as students held in bargaining for
the end of Saturday classes was that no one actually knew
how we would handle Fridays. The faculty has called our bluff,
and unless we can visibly and promptly demonstrate enough
willingness to accept the responsibility, the loss may be ours.

On eating two crows

One would think the editor of the college paper could
report with more accuracy than did this one at last week’s
Executive Committee meeting. We offer the EC our apologies
for having mistakenly reported that a student accused of an
honor violation will be given notice twenty-four hours before-
hand (it’s actually two hours’ notice).

# x

Now for the next crow. Garnishing all such repasts are
apologies, and this time they go to Staman Ogilvie. It hurts
to say this, but he did more research than we did, and his
exam proposal is more feasible than ours.

We objected to his plan on the grounds of its complexity
and time-consuming preparations. But as Mr. Ogilvie proved,
the faculty Committee on Courses and Degrees is adamant
(or even worried) about including all possible safeguards for
the students. Even though we disagree with their reasoning,
we can understand it, and we will join Mr. Ogilvie in trying
to obtain revision of the existing examination schedule.

To the Trustees

The editorial in last Friday’s edition concerning admissions
was extremely well taken, as few ever realized the numerous
problems which are faced by a small liberal arts college such
as ours is. But one situation has been seriously overlooked, one
vitally connected with admissions, and that is public relations.

The Self-Study Report of 1966 characterizes public rela-
tions as that “which covers every area of what Washington
and Lee is, what it does, and what it needs.” And, as it also
states, it influences the type of student who applies here, thus
precipitating a relationship between public relations and ad-
missions.

W&L has a very critical need for building up its public
image to make people more aware of its existence. By this we
could attract greater interest and receive a greater number of
applicants, as well as personal endowments. The world will
not wait to hear about us, rather we must let ourselves be heard
and known through public expression.

Within our own closed circles we are extremely competent:
both our Alumni and University magazines express excellently
that which is Washington and Lee. But it is not within this
confined area that we are speaking. We are concerned with the
manner in which the image of W&L is presented to the public
through media which circulates far beyond the captive audience
of parents and alumni.

As presently existing, the only outstanding external man-
ner of publicity is carried on by our Office of Information
Services and consists of little more than trivial news releases
which seldom reach the public eye. We seem to have become
bogged down in this rather ineffective type of public expres-
sion and have lost sight of the purpose of public relations.

We should attempt in the future to limit ourselves in the
great number of insignificant releases which we send out and
concentrate on just having a smaller amount of more relevant
and more interesting news material, This obviously has a greater
chance of making it into a newspaper than much of the news

an intelligible form, such that they would not require extensive
rewriting or revision, the opportunity for their being trans-
ferred to the printed word would be increased even more.

In these times, when the competition for applicants and
grants for small colleges is so greatly rising, we must realize
that an effective campaign must be conducted to obtain the
interest of the public. If we must, we should employ a pro-
fessional organization dealing with public relations to advise
and perhaps to conduct temporarily our methods of publicity,
so that we will be able to promote our image to the fullest.
It could show us the necessary steps to be taken or aid us in
improving our present manner.

Washington and Lee indeed deserves to receive greater
public exposure, for it is a unique school in which tradition is
harmoniously juxtaposed with change. We are worthy of gain-
ing more applicants and more private grants, and the most
effective way in which to obtain these ends is to promote our
image through viable public relations. —R.B.B.

By JOE TOMPKINS
Sophomore EC Representative
During the past month, Dean Kum-

puris and I have conducted a study
of the policies and operation of the
Co-op. Our study is by no means
complete but we feel that it is im-
portant at this time to give a brief
summary of our findings and make
several recommendations to be acted
upon immediately, We recommend
the following:

1, The Co-op should be open from
8-12 p.m., Monday thru Friday; it
should also be open from 10-2 p.m,
Saturday and from 7:30-10:30 p.m.
Sunday.

2. A Committee of Inquiry should
be set up, consisting of two members
of the E.C., Dean Kumpuris and
Joe Tompkins, and several members
of the administration.

3. When the Student Union opens,
first preference for jobs should be
given to interested students.

Our study was primarily prompted
by an academic concern which was
brought to our attention by a mem-
ber of the faculty. With the institution
of the five-day week it became in-
creasingly noticeable that there was
a tendency for students to leave
campus every Friday after classes
and not return until the following
Monday. In short, there was no in-
centive for a student to return to the
campus to study and work during
the weekend, particularly Friday and
Sunday nights. Also, during the week

 

R-t P Memorabilia contest
entries are near deadline

Soon The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
will publish its First Annual Me-
morabilia Issue, consisting almost en-
tirely of photographs and poetry. The
specific date of publication has yet
to be decided in order to obtain as
large a selection of pictures and
poetry as possible. All sorts of photo-
graphs are now being solicited by the
editor, as well as poetry from indi-
viduals or groups. Photo credits will
be given, of course, to all pictures
used. In addition, The Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi will provide two $10 awards.
One going to the single person or
group submitting the best group of
exemplary pictures, and the other
award going to the best poetic entry.

Due to the less than overwhelm-
ing number of entries to date, the
deadline has been extended until Fri-
day, March 21. No entries after that
date can be considered and the
decisions of the editors wil be final.
Please leave all photos and poems in
Old Dorm Room 161, or mail them
to Tuesday editor, Box 899, Lex-
ington.

there was no place for students to
get a cup of coffee or food after
10:30 p.m. Longer hours in the Co-op
seem to offer a possible solution to
this problem and this is the basis
for our first recommendation. We
feel that this recommendation war-
rants immediate action.

However, our long-range attention
should be given to the last two recom-
mendations, both of which evolved
from the first. Whereas the first is a
result of an academic concern, the
second and third are basically
financial concerns. The purpose of our
Committee of Inquiry is not to make
trouble or to cause any undue hard-
ships. We merely want to make sure
that the students of this university are
getting the best deal possible and are
being treated fairly. We plan to study
the prices of textbooks, supplies, and
other items, by comparing them with
the prices and policies of similar
Operations at other colleges and uni-
versities. Hopefully, the outcome of

 

E.C. urges Co-op changes

this inquiry will be a more efficient
and a more beneficial Co-op,

The third recommendation — is
mainly concerned with the priority
of job assignments in the new Student
Union. From the response we re-
ceived from our inquiry about student
interest in working in the Co-op it is
obvious that a substantial number of
students would like to work part-time
on campus. Although it appears to
be rather unfeasible to ask that these
students be employed in the Co-op
at the present time, it is only fair
that interested students be given first
preference for jobs in the Student
Union.

These three recommendations are
a start, but as I stated before, our
study of the Co-op is not finished,
for many more questions need to be
answered. These answers will be pre-
sented to you as they are revealed to
us, but if you have any suggestions
or specific inquiries contact Dean or
me.

 

Van Itallie’s ‘America Hurrah’ to

startle W&L audiences this week

Sometimes this school does a really
exciting thing. One of them is the
production of “America Hurrah” by
Jean-Claude van Itallie, beginning
Wednesday at the Troubadour
Theater. A more startling and in-
vigorating play could hardly be chosen
nowadays—and at W&L, notice.

The play springs from a definite
time and place. It could not have
been written before the Vietnam war
demonstrated the helplessness of
American optimism. It could not have
been produced before the evolution
of so-called off-off-Broadway theater.

Off-off-Broadway is a marriage of
radical theatrical atmosphere with
radical theatrical location. Its crea-
tors feel that their plays matter more
than their professional images. The
typical off-off-Broadway theater is a
room in a church or basement.
“America Hurrah” opened in 1966
at the cramped tiny, please-don't-ex-
hale-you'll-bother-the-actors — Pocket
Theater—only slightly larger than the
Troubadour.

Van Itallie and others make up
for lack of equipment with imagina-
tion, “America Hurrah”—three one-
act plays—stretches and reshapes the
theatrical space. Identities switch;

 

actors turn into machines or pieces
of furniture; in the third part a room
becomes an actor. Characters leave a
television screen and mix with their
viewers. Familiar sights become extra-
ordinary: a television personality ends
| her show endlessly, a politician has

 

exactly the right words to say nothing
at all.

Van Itallie uses his theatrical free-
dom to create an astonishng set of
images for _ this-land-we-know-and-
love. In “Interview,” the business of
applying for jobs conceals despera-
tion and pain. “Television” demon-
strates the danger of unconsciously
accepting a culture. And in “Motel,”
a grotesque and overpowering situa-
tion shows about as much about
America as can be shown in a
play.

Since it opened in
“America Hurrah” has enjoyed
enormous success, It strikes a re-
sponsive chord. Audiences sense that
Van Itallie’s honesty must replace the
typically American search for ideals,
One tends to think of the American
Dream as a lovely picture, but Van
Itallie points to the underside of the
dream. Our ignorance leads to viol-
ence, as recent events everywhere
demonstrate. The final image in
“America Hurrah” is one of over-
whelming violence.

A university ought to encourage
education, even though it often
doesn't. The Troubadour Theater
normally picks adventurous plays. It
is certainly doing its part with this
one, at exactly the right moment.
The play encourages the bravery need-
ed nowadays to want to be educated.
See this play for reinvigorations: if
nothing follows, it will not be the
theater's fault. —Kirk Woodward

FVYOLUTION AND
CONSERVATION

1 was in Atlanta last week and
visited Warm Springs, site of FDR's
“Litthe White House.” An alumnus
took me there. His name is George
Goodwin, WAL °39, Delta Tau Delta
(and Ring-tum Phi), Pulitzer Prize “48,

said,

“There are certain values any com-
munity has that it would want to
maintain at all costs.” (2 guess you
know what we were talking about.)
We rode on highways through the

“What makes a school good?” Mr.

And this, to paraphrase, is what he)

Barbs and Bristles ...

Not quite gone with the wind

mind: a gentleman doesn’t lies, cheat

But he suggested there's more: a
gentleman greets his fellows when
they meet. He dos this not only out
of politeness but also out of con-
cern and care for his fellow man
and respect for who and what his
companions are.

And speaking of companions, I
descended from Mt. Olympus and had
a pleasant conversation with a fresh-
man last week before leaving for
Atlanta. He maintained that from the
earliest time in the life of a fresh-
man his individuality is denied. He
explained to me slowly, as one might
to a retarded child or a Republican
that freshmen are forced to dress like
the herd and then by the questionable
virtue of a name tag are singled out
for a certain discrimination in second
class citizenship.

So his argument goes, | believe
conformity is a means with no end
necessarily involved. If we value the
means and have no end objective,
\then this freshman’s argument is
i valid. ( refuse to identify him and

Letters
To the Editor

Courtesy is appreciated
Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

I would like to express my ap-
preciation to the students of Wash-
ington and Lee University for the
courtesy extended to me during my
recent recruiting visit.

Although some students may have
resented my presence on the campus,
they did respect the rights of their
fellow students and did not interfere
with those who expressed an interest
in the officer programs of the U. S.
Marine Corps.

This reflects favorably upon the
students of Washington and Lee and
is appreciated by me.

Captain, U. S. Marine Corps

 

Don’t withhold signatures

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:
Your publication last week of the

unsigned rebuke of the Friday Phi's

spread on housing in Lexington
prompts me to write.

My most immediate concern is not
with the contents of the letter itself.
The letter reflects such incomprehen-
sible naivete as to render debate im-
possible the author has of course,
committed no wrong. His product was
neither right nor wrong, only in-
nocent. For this reason a reply to
the substance of the piece is im-
possible.

While no response to content is
possible, in my opinion it is both
possible and desirable to say a thing
or two about the nature of the letter
and about the fact that it was pub-
lished unsigned. It was essentially a
homiletical piece stating an opinion,
not arguing a case. Homilies rarely
lend themselves to critical debate, but
when the homelitician is known one
can respond to him if not to his
ideas. For example, one might suggest
to him a reading list or mention to
him the fact of mutual dependence
of all classes.

lt is, therefore, the fact that the
writer of this letter was not made
known to your readers which prompts
my reply. Moreover, I fail to see
the purpose of publishing material
of this kind from outside the Uni-
versity community. (1 am assuming
that Washington and Lee has neither
student nor faculty so innocent.)

Even when unsigned letters come
from people at the University | see
no reason for withholding the name
from the reading public. Adequate
reply can be made only when the
author is identified. Perhaps your
policy of withholding names at the
request of the writer should be re-
examined.

This semester,

your reading assignments
will probably require
around 500 hours
of your time.

You could cut it to 150.

Or 100. Or even 80 hours.

Thousands of students throughout
the country already have done so; includ-
ing students at the University of Mary-
land, the University of Virginia, and the
University of Pennsylvania.

You can, too.

Plan to enroll in the Evelyn Wood
Reading Dynamics classes being offered
now.

Our course, founded by Evelyn Wood,
a prominent educator, is the same one
President Kennedy recommended. The
same one congressmen, senators and
thousands of others have taken.

It’s the course that will at least triple
your reading efficiency. (What we mean
by efficiency is not just reading s
alone, but a combination of speed and
comprehension. )

How does the course work?

Reading Dynamics teaches your eyes
to work directly with your mind. You
take in whole groups of words, even sen-
tences and paragraphs at a glance. So
you get the total impact—just as you do
when seeing a picture for the first time.

The result? You'll end up reading 3,
5, even 10 times faster than before.

Even more important, you'll under-
stand and remember more of what you
read.

As a college student, it is self-evident
that you can reduce your homework time
substantially. It will also improve your
grades.

Once you take the course, you’re auto-
matically a lifetime member.

The program is offered at a reduced
tuition and all faculty, staff and students
are eligible to enroll.

So plan now to come to one of the free
orientation sessions. We'll explain the
course to you and answer any questions.
Naturally, there’s no obligation.
