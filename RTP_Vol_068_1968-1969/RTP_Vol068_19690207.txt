Corrigan Appointea Athletic Director;
Leslie Selected Head Football Coach

The W&L athletics department was
strengthened recently by the appoint-
ment of Eugene F. Corrigan
athletic director and by the elevation

of Coach Graham E. (Buck) Leslie
to head football coach.
Corrigan, whose official title is

Director of Intercollegiate Athletics
and Chairman of the Department of
Physical Education, began his coach-

ing career at W&L. He coached la-
crosse, soccer and basketball here
from 1955-58. He then moved to
U.Va. where he coached the same

three sports before becoming sports
information director there. He left
Charlottesville in July, 1967 to serve
as administrative assistant to Atlantic

 

Coast Conference Commissioner |
James H. Weaver. He will assume |
his duties here in early April |

Coach Leslie will continue in the
position he has held on a temporary
basis since the sudden death of coach
Lee M. McLaughlin last August. A
WAL alumnus, Coach Leslie joined
the faculty here in 1960 as assistant
coach in charge of the backfield and)
continued in that until
summer.

just two weeks before the football
season began and working with a staff

Leslie installed a new offensive sys

first four games. they came back to
three and tie one of their lasi
five, a feat which Leslie credited to
the players as “an indication of the
character and competitive spirit they
have. They don't play to lose.’

Symposium

to Explore

Some Aspects of Power

By ROGER MUNSICK

Washington and Lee’s fourth an-
nual public affairs symposium, CON-
TACT, will delve into the multifacet-
ed aspects of “Power” when it begins
next week. The last-minute addition
of Black Power speaker Jack Thomas
has caused the lengthening of the con-
ference which will now run from
February 11 to 15. (Mr. Thomas’
appearances are not included on the
posters. For times, see Weekly Cal-
endar.)

An array of seven speakers, in-
cluding Senator George McGovern of
South Dakota and civil rights leader
Charles Evers will participate in the
forum.

Fhomas, twenty-one year old
Negro from Westchester, Pennsyl-
vania, will open the conference with
an eight o'clock speech in Lee Chapel.

Already looking ahead, Leslie is
searching for an offensive coach, per-
haps an additional defensive coach,
and some athletes to replace the 17
senior players who will graduate in
June.

Leslie is used to winning teams, |
despite his modesty. During his eight
years as an assistant coach, the Gen-
erals won 44 games, lost 24 and tied

three. Included were two undefeated

seasons. He also serves as assistant
golf coach.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che KRing-tum Phi
Friday

FD Evaluation: Poor

Poor taste, poor publicity and poor planning marked this
year’s Fancy Dress Weekend as one which many would like
to forget.

The Fancy Dress Ball started the festivities off in an
elegant manner. The formal attire of the couples present and
the music of Larry Elgart gave Evans Dining Hall its yearly
appearance of Versailles. It was not until one glanced (maybe
concentrated is a better word) at the decorations that the
evening was marred.

The poor taste used by the president and vice-presidents
of Fancy Dress in the decorations could have greatly em-
barrassed the University worse than it did. The decorations
demonstrated immaturity which is highly reminiscent of fra-
ternity Homecoming displays two years ago. Fortunately, the
embarrassment was confined just to Lexington.

It is not our purpose to condemn the person who was
directly responsible for this act. But we do condemn the act.
This event led the EC to pass a recommendation Monday
night that the Dance Board president supervise the president
and vice-presidents of each weekend. The Dance Board has
never had to do this in the past. It is unfortunate it must begin
now.

Poor publicity left many a couple bewildered as to what
was happening next. It is true that the Ring-tum Phi was not
published and could not relate the schedule of events. How-
ever, there was no reason why posters could not have been
distributed around the campus and fraternities informing stu-
dents what times the cocktail party and concert were to be
held. This has always been the practice in the past.

Students and their dates were left stranded outside the
Doremus Gymnasium because they could not be admitted
until 8 p.m. Then they learned that the concert (or was it
supposed to be a dance?) would not start until 8:20 p.m.
In addition, many couples left after the first group finished
because there was no announcement telling them there was
to be another group.

The cocktail party was another story. Most students as-
sumed the party would begin at the customary hour of 4 p.m.
When they arrived at the Pavillion they found the party had
been in progress for an hour and a half. Even so, those who
wanted something to drink had to wait for ice.

Probably the worst thing that could have happened to a
student at the cocktail party was to get a ticket from the police
for parking on the street. The tow trucks (which we later
learned were to pull cars out of mud) also gave one an in-
secure feeling as to whether his car would be there or not
after the party.

Whar all this boils down to is that it is the responsibility
of the presidents of the weekends to plan them. It is not the
responsibility of the Dance Board (except for the entertain-
ment at concerts). This is why it is especially disappointing
when a weekend like Fancy Dress, which has a national
reputation and is run by a president elected by the student
body, ends up being a fiasco, Past experience shows a little
extra planning and care can make a weekend a memorable
occasion, one which will be looked forward to in the years to
come. Without these elements the weekends will degenerate
into nothing.

Local Tags for Students

We were disturbed at a recent editorial published in the
Lexington News-Gazette, and we wish to reprint it for you
at this time. It appeared under the headline, “Another Source
of Revenue.”

 

“The town of Ashland has obtained an opinion from
the State Attorney General with reference to local tags on
automobiles owned by college students. It applied specifically
to those driven by Randolph-Macon students. The ruling,
however, would be good all over the State.

“The Attorney General stated that the law required
all college students living at the seat of the college for nine
months of the year to affix local tags to their cars. The
residence of the student would determine what tag was
applicable.

“For instance, a student living in Lexington would need
a Lexington City tag and one living in the County would
need a Rockbridge County tag.

“If a Virginia student already had a tag on his car
from a Virginia county or city, a new tag would not be
necessary. But for all others from out of state or from
localities within the State where the car had no local tag,
a tag is called for.

"This has been a question that has come up in Lex-
ington a number of times in the past, and of course the
students have objected to buying the tags. For various
reasons, one being the trouble involved, the letter of the
law has never been enforced here.

“Now, however, with new sources of revenue badly
needed for advancing school costs, water development and
other things, there seems little reason for not enforcing

the use of these tags, and also for not assessing the owners
of the cars with a local property tax on them.”

Thus far, the Lexington City Treasurer has not enforced
this ruling. But if he were to in the future, there would be an
alarming injustice dealt to Washington and Lee students. Ac-
cording to the Virginia Attorney General’s ruling, a person
is considered a resident of a locality if he lives in that locality
for nine months out of the year. On the other hand, we
learned from the City Registrar that one must live in a state
for one year, in a city for six months and a precinct for 30
days before he is eligible to vote. This is according to a statute
in the Virginia Constitution.

In addition, in order for a student to vote in Lexington,
he must, according to the Registrar, file a declaration of per-
sonal property and make a statement that he intends to make
Lexington his permanent home.

The above means, that we, as students and residents of
a Virginia locality, must pay taxes in a locality before we
can even vote there.

No one in the Registrar’s or the Treasuret’s offices was able
to explain this discrepency to us. We do not believe that any-
one can. We can just be thankful that the City Treasurer has
chosen not to enforce this ruling, which would subject the
student body, especially those who own automobiles, to a gross
inequity.

Foul on Sportsmanship

After the brilliant comeback of Washington and Lee’s
basketball team Wednesday night, we have a lot to be proud
of. At the same time, we have a lot to be ashamed about. We
are referring, of course, to the barbarous sportsmanship ex-
hibited by the W&L spectators.

As a school which purports to be the haven of “gentle-
men,” W&L surely did fall short of its claim. Unsportsman-
like activity included swaying arms in the opposing players’
faces during foul shots, pitching pennies toward the opponents’
bench, throwing paper o nthe floor, and, most disgusting of
all, cursing the referees and players to their faces. We can-
not understand why a technical foul was not called against
W&L. We also would not have been surprised if the refrees
had cleared the gym of spectators (a right reserved by the
referees if the spectators are too rowdy).

This lack of sportsmanship may have been just enough
to rile the opponents and allow W&L to win the game. Yet,
we wonder if it was worth it. A Roanoke Times article Thurs-
day quoted the Roanoke coach as saying, “We'll never play
here (W&L) as long I am coach. We didn’t play well enough
to win. . . but there is no excuse for throwing pennies at
our bench.”

This is not the only team which refuses to come to W&L
to play. Large schools which would provide stiff competition
will not travel here. We can’t blame this entirely on the
physical plant of the gymnasium. Much of the blame must
be leveled on the horrible behavior of the students.

It is always encouraging when we see W&L students break
out of their apathetic shells and display some emotion about
something. But if this is the only way in which we can express
ourselves, it may be better just to remain passive.

 

Passavant Outlines
Future Goals of EC

By JAY PASSAVANT
President of Executive Committee
As we begin a new semester, 1

think it would be beneficial for me
to outline the goals of the Executive
Committee for the new term. Logi-
cally, many of the projects begun in
the first semester will be completed
in the near future and in addition,
several new programs will be initiat-
ed. We are on the verge of passing
important legislation in several areas
which will have direct consequence on
the student body.

The Dance Board Investigation
Committee (Bauer and Tompkins)
have thoroughly evaluated all present
Dance Board policies and upon dis-
cussion in the last E.C, meeting pro-
posed several changes from previous
policies. These recommendations were
voted on and passed by the E.C. as
reported in the front page of today’s
Ring-tum Phi.

The proposed Individual Exam
Schedule Resolution (Ogilvie and
Brown) has been approved by the
Executive Committee and is now in
the hands of the Committee on
Courses and Degrees of the faculty.
Details of this plan will be worked
out through our representatives on
the Faculty E.C. and a final report
to be voted on by the faculty should
be forthcoming.

The Student Civil Liberties Com-
mittee under the direction of Jack
Horowitz and Rob Turnbull will give
a preliminary report at the February
10 meeting. The ultimate goal of
this committee is a Student Bill of
Rights to be amended to the Consti-
tution.

Mock OAS
Selects Officers

The Mock Organization of Ameri-
can States, to be held here in mid-
March, has selected most of its
officers and has begun administrative
work in preparation for the event.

Jorge Estrada, senior from Me-
dellin, Colombia, is the chairman of
the Steering Committee. Others on
the committee are Paul Wojcik, (Con-
ference) Secretary-General; Tom
Blanton, (Conference) Assistant Secre-
tary-General; John Motsinger, Chair-
man of Delegations; Pat Arey and
Hank Graddy, Assistant Delegation
Chairmen; and Richard Watt, Steve
Sandler, Mike Nation, and Neil
Kessler.

The ambassadors to the Inter-
American Council are as follows: Jay
Wetsel, Argentina; Richard Watt,
Barados; Bob Gill, Bolivia; Homer
Gamble, Brazil; Walter Sales, Can-
ada (Observer status); Kenn George,
Chile; Alan Stedman, Colombia; Bob
Baroody, Costa Rica; Fran Lawrence,
Cuba (non-voting status); Charlie
Holt and Mike Hosford, Dominican
Republic; Bob Herring, Ecuador; Ray
Hartwell, El Salvador; Tom Metecaff,
Guatemala; Mark Small, Haiti; Justin
Adams, Honduras; Pat Arey, Mexico;

(Continued on Page 4)

 

 

Also regarding the Student Body
Constitution, Joe Tompkins plans to
undertake a program of evaluation
and addition beginning next week. He
will receive aid from one other E.C,
member but any student interested
in assisting Joe should come to the
February 10 EC meeting.

Of primary importance is the work
of the two sub-committees (and the
E.C, as a whole) presently investigat-
ing the present framework of the
Honor System. A student discussion
on this topic is planned in the near
future in the form of a “Bitch-In,”
however this action will be delayed
until a preliminary report of the
L.C, sub-committee is completed. The
final report will be compiled into a
booklet entitled “The Honor System”
which will be distributed to all mem-
bers of the Student Body. It will
contain detailed descriptions of trial
procedure and student rights so that
every student will have the opportun-
ity to better understand the operation
of the Honor System.

Steve Sandler is investigating the
possibility of establishing a reading
clinic here at W&L on a non-credit
basis. He will report on Feb. 17th.

The Curriculum Committee has
been instructed to analyze and evalu-
ate the proposed 12-6-12 program
from the student's viewpoint, This
sub-committee will report to the E.C,
and definite recommendations will be
made, Alternative changes in the cur-
riculum may be proposed.

The value of the VASG will be
definitely determined in the next six
months and a decision by our stu-
dent government as to whether or not
to participate will be made.

Dean Kumpuris and Joe Tompkins
are engaged in a study of the opera-
tion of the Co-op with plans to
investigate longer hours, prices and
more student jobs.

The points that have been men-
tioned are by no means the only
ones that will be studied this semester.
Other issues of considerable import-
ance will most likely be discussed
later in the spring or when oppor-
tunities for their study arise. One
point | would like to make is that
the representation granted the EC in
faculty and administration — last
semester should prove to be of con-
siderable importance in determining
policies for the future. Joint meet-
ings with the faculty EC as well as
a permanent student member on the
faculty EC, regular reports to the
faculty and in fact representation of
the Student Body at the next Board
of Trustees Meeting should prove of
immeasurable value in attaining the
previously outlined goals,

In keeping with the EC’s effort to
make a student government a more
inclusive affair, | would encourage
your attendance to every EC meeting
and particularly those at which you
feel you have a viewpoint that should
be heard. Meetings are held every
Monday at 7:15 p.m. in the Student
Union. If you feel the goals presented
are not ambitious enough or that
you can add to our efforts, we wel-
come your atiendance,

 

By RODDY RODIGER
and DAVE SCHUSTER

A student rating of the faculty was
made in early December as a re-
search project for a course. This
study has caused quite a bit of mis-
understanding which needs to be
cleared up, In no way was this study
an attempt to attack the faculty in
general or certain members of it,

Actually the rating of individual
members was peripheral to our main
task, which was to examine the re-
lationship between a number of fac-
tors, ¢.g. grade in course and rating
of the professor. However, in the
process of obtaining these data indi-
vidual ratings of professors were also
obtained.

On a random basis, 141 seniors
received the questionnaire, and 118
(84%) were completed and returned
to us, On a five point seale, each
student rated each of his teachers at
Washington and Lee (and who are
still on the faculty) on six criteria:
1) Lectures—interesting, stimulating;
2) Lectures—well-organized, under-
standable: 3) Quizzes and Exams—
fair, reasonable; 4) Encourages cre-
ative thinking: 5) Knowledge of sub-
ject; 6) Overall performance of pro-
fessor

Without going into the laborious
statistical details, a few of our find-
ings can be noted. In the first place,
ii is interesting to note that neither
GPR nor grade in the course cor-
related highly with the rating of the
professor, In other words, the rat
ings students gave professors cannot
be explained by the grades the pro

 

fessor gave the students

 

Another finding is that the students
were, on the whole, too lenient, The
rating scale was 1-5, with 1 being
“Superior,” 2—"Good,.” 3—"Aver-
age,” 4—"Poor” and $—‘Terrible.”
The students were told to rate each
faculty member in relation to all
others he had, So the mean score
for the entire faculty for each criter-
ion should be “Average,” Le., 3. For
five of the six criteria the average

Students’ Project Grades

faculty's “knowledge” anyway. All the
other averages (except one) on criteria
for the whole faculty ranged between
2.40 and 2.65,

The exception is “Encourages crea-
tive thinking,” where the faculty re-
ceived a mean rating of 3.23, This
is very interesting, especially since
almost every study attempting to de-
termine what students want most in
a teacher have indicated that some

(mean) is lower, and thus more fav-| factor resembling “Encourages crea-

orable to the faculty. Knowledge of
subject was best (1.75), understand-
ably enough, since it is rather pre-
sumptuous for students to fate the

 

tive thinking” is felt to be most im-
portant.

It has often been asserted that

interested in learning, only out for
a gentleman's C or B, etc, The blame
has been variously placed, often on
the fraternity system or Rush Week.
Perhaps attention should be turned
in another direction, ic, back on the
faculty and the lecture system. The
lecture system by its very nature
encourages non-involvement, or al
best a passive involvement with what
is going on. How can this encourage
creative thinking? Perhaps those few
professors (10) who had superior rat-
ings for encouraging creative think-
ing are the ones who can really make
the lecture system work effectively, of
who have given it up altogether. At
any the fault does not lie, as
we see it, entirely with the students

When we collected the individ.
ual ratings of faculty members we
were very hopeful that something
constructive could be done with
them, We hoped that individual
faculty members would use the rat-
ings us student critiques and would
perhaps take them inte account
when trying to rework their courses
and lectures, More to the point,
it is hoped faculty members would
see where the students think they
are performing poorly and would
try to improve. This is, perhaps,
being fantastically idealistic, I was
decided that publishing the entire
list of faeulty ratings would not
serve our purpose and would only
make the low scorers defensive and
resentful. Instead we are report
ing only the “Superior” ratings.

noke coach, Charles Moir, did not
seem to have much to leave Doremus
with except possibly a few unpleasant
memories and a few pennies thrown
at him by the slightly infuriated fans.
The Roanoke Times quoted Moir as
saying he never wanted to come
back to Washington and Lee. Part of
the reason was of course the 49-47
loss to the Generals, although the
crowd played no small part in his
decision.

The first half opened with some
weak officiating and a number of
W&L turnovers which all added up
to a Roanoke advantage during the
entire first half. Jumping out to an
8-2 lead with five minutes gone, Roa-
noke forced W&L into taking a time
out to reassess its game strategy. After
that the Maroons built their lead to
ten points which was about the way
it stayed until the half when the
score was 22-32,

An amazing transformation seemed
to take place in the fifteen minutes
between the halves. Washington and
Lee opened up with a blaze of scor-
ing that brought them within four
points, 33-37 with 13:08 left, when
Roanoke called time. Roanoke then
completed a three point play to raise
their lead to seven. Shortly after-

Almost without notice, the Wash-

In contests before exams, the rifle

were scored over George Washington,
Richmond, Virginia, and William and

ball downcourt and quickly popped
one in, then turned around, stole the
ball and put in a not-so-easy lay-up
to make the score 37-40, still the
Maroons’ advantage. Roanoke then
called time out with 10:51 remaining
to play.

With 7:37 remaining the score stood
at 41-44 and W&L lost the ball on a
three second violation and Roanoke
capitalized on the mistake making
the score 41-46, With 6:45 left Mike
Daniel put in a free throw to make
the score 42-46.

Roanoke stole the ball, after W&L
missed the second foul shot, and was
called for walking, W&L taking pos-
session. W&L then missed a shot and
Roanoke called time after getting the
rebound with 5:33 left to play the
score still 42-46.

A quick exchanged followed the
time out with Neer intercepting the
ball an dthen losing it, and the
Maroons immediately turning it over
again for walking. Cartwright then
scored to pull the deficit to two points.
Roanoke missed its next shot, Mike
Daniel grabbing the rebound, and the
Generals called time with 3:59 re-
maining with the score 44-46,

After the Generals stalled for a
short time, Neer put in a basket with
3:36 remaining, but it was disallowed.
With the ball, Frank Allen of Roa-
noke was fouled and made one shot
putting the score at 44-47 Roanoke,
when the Generals called time, 2:39
remaining. Washington and Lee kick-
ed the ball out of bounds and Roa-
noke got possession but again failed
to score. Then Mike Daniel missed a
foul shot after he was fouled down-
court,

Roanoke seemed to be powerless
without Frank Allen and could not
put the ball in the basket. With 54

Spring Football Practice Begins
Wednesday Afternoon on Wilson

Football candidates will report for
“spring” football practice Wednesday,
February 12, hoping for good weather
during the two and a half weeks of
workouts.

National Collegiate Athletic As-

sociation rules allow college teams 20 |

practice sessions in the spring semes-
ter, primarily to integrate freshmen
into the school’s system. As most
of the General freshmen are already
familiar with the varsity system,
spring football at W&L is a chance
to work out some kinks, get in some
contact work and make additions or
deletions in the offenses and defenses.

Spring practice is traditionally held
at Washington and Lee early in the
second semester to accomodate other
coaches of spring sports. Football
coach Buck Leslie is expecting to see
most of the faces that will be eligible
for next season and hoping that the
mild weather will continue. In the
past, spring practice has been plagued
by snow, but last year the weather
was perfect and there is hope that

for some fearsome foursome types to
replace his graduating ends and

stocked with talent, and the defensive
backfield is also full of veterans.
On offense, Coach Leslie will see
almost all of last year’s regulars with
one glaring exception. The Generals
will need to find a replacement for
senior Bucky Cunningham, a sure-
handed star the past two seasons,
All players are asked to report to
the stadium dressing room at 3:30 on
Wednesday and practices will be held
that day and Thursday of the first
week. Then the next two weeks,
practices will be held Monday through
Friday, culminating in an encounter
with an alumni squad on March 1.
