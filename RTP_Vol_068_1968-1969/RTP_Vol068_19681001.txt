By JAY PASSAVANT
Student Body President

During my campaign last spring,
there was a good deal of interest
shown in my pro-
posal of a Wash-
ington and Lee-
Lexington Com-
munity “Big Broth-
er” system. In the
past, there has
been very little op-
portunity for any
interested students
to get out in the
local area and
meet face to face
the problem of our
underprivileged youth. The proposed
big-brother system, with its obvious
community relations advantages,
would offer any interested W&L men
a chance to come in contact with and
offer some help to a local boy who
for some reason or another has not
had an interest shown in him in his
family life.

After checking with Dr. Hodges of

 

the religion dept. I learned that
there was little hope in attaining as-
sistance through the National Big-
Brother Foundation. He suggested

that my best alternative was to work
through local channels rather than
national. Last week, after a discus-
sion with coach Verne Canfield, I
learned that the Lexington Boy's Club
had been put back on its feet and
was Open once again to Lexington
boys. Mr. Canfield reported that he
had been placed in charge of the
organization this past summer and
that he had been fortunate enough to
receive enough assistance,
and monetary, to re-organize
club.

For those who are not familiar
with the Boy's Club, it was estab-
lished about two years ago by Chuck
Beale, a former VMI Cadet and
local citizen, and Bob Brenner, a
1967 WAL graduate. These two men
organized the club, found a suitable
clubhouse on the outskirts of Lex-
ington. and proceded to carry most
of the burden for its operation. The
club is open to Lexington boys of
ages 4-15 and offers recreational fa-
cilities, sports equipment and guidance
by the counselors.

Mr. Canfield expressed a sincere
need for a group (15-20) of Wash-
ington and Lee men who would be
interested in serving as counselors or
big brothers to these Lexington boys.
The only requirement is a few hours
a week and a genuine desire to help
young boys. The time spent with these
boys is not only a lot of fun, but also
personally rewarding in many dif-
ferent ways.

Discrimination of girls’ housing
opposed by I.F.C. resolution

The IFC last night approved a
resolution deploring the apparent
discrimination in some of the ap-
proved Lexington housing for girls
from the surrounding schools. The
proposal introduced by IFC treasurer
Mark Eaker urged that the girls’
schools be made aware of the fact
that action be taken.

Dean Atwood said that this topic
was on the agenda of a meeting
planned for Wednesday between the
deans and student leaders of the sur-
rounding schools, and he questioned
the wisdom of the IFC’s timing on
this resolution feeling that it might
stir hasty action among the schools
in question.

The resolution states: “Resolved,
that the Interfraternity Council of
Washintgon and Lee University rec-
ognizes the fact that a large number
of licensed lodging houses in Lex-
ington practice racial discrimination
in extending hospitality to female
guests, and that many of these
houses are included on approved hous-
ing lists of the various female insti-
tutions of higher learning.”

“Be it further resolved that the
Interfraternity Council deplores the
above situation and recommends that
the institutions involved be made)
cognizant of the situation that exists |
in Lexington so that these institutions
may take whatever action that they
may deem necessary for its correct-
ion.”

In other action president Clark
Carter said that a copy of the “Book
of Knowledge” encylopedia had been
received by the IFC to be given to a
needy Lexington organization. Carter
said that the decision had been tenta-
tively reached to donate the encyclo-
pedia to the Lexington Boys’ Club.
Jay Passavant also noted that the EC
is supporting a program to involve
WAL students with the Lexington
youth through the Boys’ Club and
that there would be a meeting of all
those interested Wednesday evening
in the third floor of Washington Hall
at 8 p.m.

Dean Atwood noted that during the
summer the Lexington city council
had passed a stringent anti-noise ordi-
nance. He said that for the first

nual earnings of all the fraternity

News analysis
By MARK EAKER

This past weekend a member of
the student body of a girl’s school in
this area was denied lodging at the
majority of the boarding houses in
Lexington. She came to Lexington in
order to date a member of the W&L
student body. As a result of this, on
Monday night the IFC adopted a
resolution recognizing and deploring
the existence of racial discrimination
on the part of hostesses in Lexing-
ton.

Within the IFC there was no dis-
sent as to the appropriateness of that
organization adopting the resolution,
nor concerning the wording of the
resolution. I do feel, however, that
some clarification is needed in order
that the student body as a whole will
understand why the resolution was
passed and why it reads the way it
does.

First, it is my belief and that of
the IFC that one of its functions
should be to protect the interests of
the fraternities and the members of
the fraternity system. Clearly the
availability of housing for dates of

Abolition of Saturday classes
will be considered by faculty

The special faculty committee ap-
pointed by President Huntley to con-|
sider the question of abolishing Sat- |
urday classes and establishing a|
five day academic week has pub-|
lished its report. The committee sub-|
mitted five different plans to the |
faculty for consideration. i

The committee, headed by Dr. |
Cook, includes Dr. Hamer, Dr. Me-|
Guire, and Dr. Royston. The com- |
mittee failed to endorse any specific
proposal, but the report stated that
a plan, basically similar to our ex-
isting schedule with the five extra
morning hours being put in the after- |
noon, had the most support among |
the members of the committee.

All five of the plans have shifted |
the class hours from the present
8:25-4:40 schedule to a schedule with |
classes at 8 a.m. and ending at 4 p.m. |
Of the five plans analyzed by the |
report only three of the plans had |
provisions for no Saturday classes.
One of these plans, which had no
support among the committee mem-
bers, was a variation of a plan pre-
sented by the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
last spring.

The remaining two plans do not
abolish Saturday classes but merely
reflect the shift of the class hours to
more early schedule. The plans
will be discussed at the October fac-
ulty meeting next Monday.

Attached to the report was a poll
of the faculty on questions relating to

A half million dollars: a news report

 

Saturday classes. Of the 87 faculty
members that replied to the poll, over
65 percent said that they favored a
five day week. Another question re-
vealed that over a majority of the
faculty members favored teaching in
the morning only.

Special meeting
for newspapermen

There will be a special one-hour
meeting on Monday, October 7 at 2
p.m. in the Ring-tum Phi office which
must be attended by all freshmen
and sophomores on the Tuesday staff.

The purpose of the meeting, spon-
sored by the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi,
is to acquaint the younger members
of the staff with journalism’s finer
points as they apply to the school
newspaper.

Some reflections on a very noteworthy address

We have encouraging indications from many sources
that Washington and Lee’s financial future

 

President Huntley said that since the late
1950s the University has concentrated on
human needs and that it now behooves Wash-
ington and Lee to so deal with its accumula-
tion of physical needs.

But his was no mere philosophical rhe-
toric; specifics were discussed with an air of
near-finality: no priorities will be assigned for
the construction of physical structures, as none
need be assigned; there will be no ‘trans-
formation by edict or fiat.”

Specific structures were mentioned. The
impression was given that nearly all the in-
adequate facilities on campus would be re-

Huntley Johnson’s admonition

In last Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi a serious
though veiled admonition was made to the
fraternities by the IFC rush chairman and
head of the Deferred Rush Committee, Hunt-
ley Johnson. Mr. Johnson is concerned about
the likelihood (or near-certainty) of dirty
rush next year and urges the fraternities to
adopt a mutual pledge against it.

Although our “one step further” may
seem absurdly naive at first, we urge the
IFC to consider it in view of the past (dirty)
rush week and Mr. Johnson’s comments.

A considered plea to the faculty and administration

We are aghast after reading the report
to the faculty recently distributed by a com-
mittee appointed to study a five-day week. It
seems as though the committee is not only
discounting the opinion of a majority of both
students and faculty but is coming danger-
ously close to ignoring it.

Five plans are submitted by the commit-
tee of four for consideration by the faculty.
Two of the plans include Saturday classes,
and one of these extends some A through J
classes into the afternoon. Three of the plans
omit Saturday classes: two, one of which has
the most support on the committee, schedule
some A through J classes in the afternoon;
the third is one about which we have a few
words.

The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi polled the stu-
dent body and the faculty last year, and in
the largest turnout ever on this campus 73
per cent of the students voting responded
favorably to the Lynchburg College plan of

A rare opportunity

Tomorrow Washington and Lee students
will have two occasions to hear what has been
described as “an enthralling if not inspiring
speech” by the late Liz herself, Gertrude
Behanna. Coming to Lexington after rigorous
and lengthy entreaties by Rev. Irving, Mrs.
Behanna will surely deliver an address not
to be missed.

Despite one’s religious convictions, it must
be admitted that any speaker who Feceives a
ten-minute standing ovation at Yale is at least
interesting and at best beyond adequate de-
scription,

About our photographs

This is an apology for the photographs
in the first issues of The Ring-tum Phi, which
at their best are not of as fine a quality as
most in last year’s papers. The fault is not
that of the photographers—who have done a
superb job—but that of Mr. Kessler and my-
self,

As reported in The Friday Ring-tum Phi,
the Publications Board purchased an engrav-
ing machine with which zine plates are made

In his tones of customary understatement, President Hunt-
ley indicated in an address to the University that Washington
and Lee is about to undergo a change, in somewhat more than
a minor way. For several months we have awaited word from
the super-secret Office of University Development—there have
been no few intimations of massive, concrete proposals soon
to emanate from the project. It now seems as though the
revelation of a Master Plan is imminent, a plan which will
involve millions of dollars and a substantial set of assets for
Washington and Lee.

Ring-tum Phi

will not be bleak.

Opening Assembly, September 18, 1968

placed or repaired extensively. It doesn’t re-
quire a great deal of thought to imagine what
effect a new gymnasium would have on the
athletic program, a new theatre on the fine
arts program, an increase in the library’s
capacity and renovation in Tucker and New-
comb Halls on the school’s academic and
research stature.

Perhaps a package deal with adequate,
comfortable dormitories in which all students
would live. The future of Washington and
Lee and its stake in greatness among Ameti-
can colleges are being scrutinized and pro-
jected. We await further indications with
profound interest.

and a step further

If every fraternity is allowed to say what-
ever it pleases to rushees, what harm can be
done in the ultimate results at the end of
the first semester? We believe none, save dis-
respect in the eyes of the rushees for those
fraternities which dirty rush.

Next year’s rush will be at least sixteen
times as long as past years’, giving rushees
ample opportunity to decide for themselves
the validity of dirty rush statements as well
as to ponder the worthiness and motives of a
fraternity that resorts to such tactics.

morning only Monday through Friday classes.
In fact, only 9 per cent of the students who},
voted and 45 per cent of the faculty who
voted favored afternoon classes. And in a
poll of the faculty recently taken by the com-
mittee only 35 per cent expressed a desire
for afternoon classes.

What is even more confounding is that
the committee did not present the Lynchburg /
Ring-tum Phi plan in its report, but rather
a version of it—a version which is so poor
a copy that it necessitates 20 extra school days
in the year. As originally proposed, this would
not be the case.

We will make no hasty accusations, but
it bewilders us that the committee acted as
though it were an entity unto itself, unre- |
sponsive to the clearly expressed will of the
majority. Our sincerest plea is made to the
faculty and administration to weigh the ques-
tion of Saturday and afternoon classes more
judiciously than did the committee.

previous annual payments for this service. Un-
fortunately, technique is not for sale; and
until such time as we two editors have mastered

indulgence.

To the parents

The Ring-tum Phi has made a profit very
few years in its history. The paper's budget is
not the most flexible we've seen, so in order
to save (and make) money, the editors have
two solutions this year.

The first is the purchase of a Photo-Lathe
engraver, described above, which should save
$1,500 per year after this year until the mid-
1970s. The second is to solicit subscriptions
from the parents of students.

We do not intend to harangue about how
valuable it is to you to receive The Ring-tum
Phi, as you may judge for yourself from
these first four free issues, But in case some
of you can’t quite decide, we'll close by say-
ing that the editors are paid a paltry salary
indeed but one whose size is a percentage of

 

Foreign study excites students —

By TOM GILLESPIE

As the old cliche goes, “foreign
travel is broadening” and if this be
true, foreign study can be doubly so,
Realizing this, the Washington and
Lee Foreign Study Committee lends
every effort to help interested students
study abroad for a year, a semester,
or maybe just for the summer and
receive up to 12 semester hours of
credit for their work.

Although W&L does not have its
own foreign study program, Dr. David
Dickens, chairman of the Foreign
Study Committee, has explained that
there are numerous possibilities for
study abroad in almost every field of
interest.

Dr. Dickens stated, “the commit-
tee wants foreign study to be more
than the private reserve of language
majors as previously believed.” For
example, some programs (particularly

in Holland, Scandinavia, and the
Orient) are built around English-

language instruction.

Any W&L student considering study
abroad should plan ahead even as
early as the freshman year. A cumu-
lative GPR of 2.5 (through the sopho-
more year) is required and a student
will find it difficult to raise his aver-
age at the last moment,

When the decision is made to at-
tempt to study abroad, the procedure
is relatively simple. To begin, the
prospective applicant should study the
available programs and with the help
of the committee or of a language
professor decide which programs are
best suited to his individual interest.

Foreign study programs vary great-
ly in respect to the quality of instruc-
tion, living accommodations, trans-
portation to and from the foreign
country, subjects offered, and dura-
tion of study.

The prospective applicant should
make a formal application to the
Foreign Study Committee. If the ap-
plicant meets the university's require-
ments and has a written note from
his parents giving their consent, he
will receive the endorsement of the
committee. The applicant then needs
only to apply to the program that
he has decided upon.

In considering the financial aspect
of foreign study the student should
know that a year’s study in a foreign
country is usually comparable to a
year at W&L, sometimes less.

Clint Murchinson and Larry
Boetsch, two WAL students, spent
last year in Spain studying in Mary
Baldwin's “Year in Madrid” program.

 

__Murchison reports that the courses

were “extremely demanding but I feel
that I'm learning more than ever be-
fore in my life... without a doubt
the most valuable experience of my
life.” Boetsch comments, “I have that
wonderful feeling of really having
learned something last year.”

“Each day continued to be a brand-
new experience, and the whole pro-
gram turned out even better than |
had hoped.” However, both men la-

ment the fact that there were so many

 

more female participants than male, |

The student participating in a
foreign study program is administra-
tively no longer considered a W&L
student so far as draft classification
goes. However, the institution which
administers the program certifies the
participant as a full time student
at that school,

Grades and credit for work done
abroad are normally transferred back

Yow acclaims superb portrayals

By JOHN YOW
Critic

Today one is immediately suspici-
ous of movies of suspense and/or
movies dealing with the supernatural.
These genres are
decidedly not a la

and the artsy-

think that I thereby reduced the
film’s potential from my own stand-

cover any gaping flaws but I was
quite favorably impressed with this
film in virtually every respect.
The film is a William Castle pro-
duction and is taken from Ira Levin's
recent novel by the same name to
which it remains quite faithful. The
story tells of Rosemary (Mia Far-
row) being raped by Satan in order
to produce a future king from the

Generals return to ther own kind—
they hope—this Saturday when they
face Centre College in Danville, Ky.

The Colonels, in a rebuilding year,
are 0-2 for the season, and so is
WAL after losses to strong Guilford
and Randloph-Macon.

“Centre should be more on our
level,” W&L coach Buck Leslie com-
mented, “but that’s not meant to
downgrade them. They have a good
team, it's a conference game and it’s
their Homecoming, so they'll be up
for us.”

Centre has lost its entire starting
backfield and three starting offensive
linemen from last year’s 7-2 squad
which tied W&L and Washington of
St. Louis for second place in the
College Athletic Conference. Includ-

ed in the losses was a 6-0 setback by|

W&L.
Gone are quarterback Joe La-
Monica and halfback Ben Boone, but

 

Washington and Lee’s soccer team
began living up to its potential on
Friday, beating Pfeiffer College 4-2.
This evened the General's record at
1-1, and put an end to any doubts
about this year’s team.

Blue controlled the game. Pfeiffer
lacked enough individual stars, and
their teamwork wasn’t anywhere near
the equal of the home team’s. The
one saving grace they had was their
goalie, Benny Clodfelter, who man-
aged to keep the Generals down to
one goal for the first half.

Scott Fechnay scored all four goals
for W&L in another brilliant per-
formance. The Generals have played
in two game so far, accumulating
seven goals. Of those seven, four
have been scored by Fechnay.

But Friday's game was hardly a

Plagued by injuries early in the
game, the Brigadier football team
bowed 23-0 to a strong Staunton Mili-

unusually large crowd turned out to
cheer for the J.V.’s, and while the
results must have disappointed them,
the game itself couldn't have.

ceptions, despite the lopsided score.

an injured knee, put on a fine dis-
play of ball control, as well as play-
ing excellent man-to-man defense. He
had a difficult time keeping up the
pace, however, and had to be rested
toward the end of the first half.
Further conditioning should cure that.

The game started off quickly
enough as Fechnay surprised the visi-
tors with a goal on a pass from
Horowitz. After the initial shock, the
Blue kept on applying a constant pres-
sure. On one play, there was heavy
fighting around the Pfeiffer goal when
the goalie fumbled the ball. Fechnay,
lying on the ground in front of the
goalmouth, just managed to get a
leg into the ball with an open net
in front of him. But Horowitz just
then slipped and blocked the shot.
Although they were clearly in com-
mand of the game, the Blue just
couldn't score.

Finally, as the half was about to

(Continued on Page 4)

but as the quarter was about to end,
SMA intercepted a WA&L pass and
ran it back for a touchdown. The
same thing happened again in the
second quarter, and so as the half
ended, the Brigadiers were trailing by
14-0. Injuries to Scott Gibbs at half-
back and Ray Royce at fullback were
hurting the Blue's already thin back-
field.

In the third quarter, the vistors
were still unable to dent the W&L

ball away from SMA on downs on
their own 4-yard line. But on the
first play from scrimmage, the Blue
fumbled and recovered in their own
end zone, giving their opponents a
two point safety. Another touchdown
in the fourth quarter ended the scor-
ing.

Coach Poudrier was very pleased
with the team's overall showing, how-
ever. “The defensive team did a really
fine job, and the offense when it
finally got moving, looked good too.
This was probably the toughest game
we'll have for the rest of the year.”

away game against Massanutten Mili-
tary Academy this Friday, and will

returning is senior halfback Jerry
Schenz, the CAC’s leading scorer with
60 points last year, and end Doug
Eaton, the Colonels’ leading pass re-
ceiver.

Schenz has been hurt but is re-
ported to be well and ready to go
against the Generals.

“We get all the breaks,” was Coach
Leslie’s comment.

Although outscored 45-21 by Ran-
dolph-Macon’s powerful Yellow Jack-
ets last Saturday, W&L may have
found the offense it has been looking
for in the passing of Jack Baizley
and the running-passing ability of
Chuck Kuhn.

Baizley hit 11 of 21 against Macon
for 177 yards and two touchdowns.
Kuhn hit 3 of 6, including the other
touchdown, and ran well.

Pass receiver Bucky Cunningham
played his second straight fine game,
grabbing nine passes for 139 yards
and two TD’s. End Steve Mahaffey

 

snagged five for 47 yards and one
score, and did an excellent job cover-
ing on punts.

Of Randolph-Macon, Coach Leslie
said “We played a good team, a
strong team. When you boil every-
thing down, the difference was
Howard Stevens.”

Indeed he was. The shifty little
Yellow Jacket halfback ran by the
W&L defense for 113 yards, caught
three passes for another 75 yards
scored two touchdowns and set up
several other scores. And he’s just a
freshman.

After two very tough games, the
bugaboo Leslie feared the most—in-
juries—have begun to emerge. Two
starters, halfback Luke Crosland and
linebacker and co-captain John Wolf
have banged-up knees and will sit
out the Centre game. Several other
key players are nursing severe bruises
and sprains and will not be up to
full effectivness if they are able to
play at all.

; Sounding off...

By ROY CARLTON
Sports Editor

In late November, as the football
season draws to a close, Army will
play Navy, Duke will play UNC,
and Georgia will play Georgia Tech.
But who will Washington and Lee
play? Washington University? That
hardly seems like a contest to match
the other three.

And so it has always been, and
so it probably always will be. W&L
hasn't had a serious arch-rival since
1953, when last it played big-time
football. Then it was Virginia, and
a more deadly rivalry you couldn't
imagine. It seemed almost fitting that
two schools which compete so in-
tensely, academically and socially,
should do the same on the gridiron.
Although the Wahoos usually won,
that never seemed to mattter to the
die-hard Minks. Every once in a while
they'd get their revenge by pounding
the Cavaliers into the dust.

In 1954 subsidized football vanish-
ed from W&L, and when the new age
of amatuer football was born in 1955,
the Generals were no longer a match
for the boys from Charlottesville.
They played an entirely new schedule
now with teams they had never heard
ot before. Nothing has ever replaced
the Wahoos.

From all the teams that the Gen-
erals have been playing in the past

.| decade, the university administration

and the athletic department have
selected two around which to build
a rivalry. Correctly, they have real-
ized that a strong rivalry solidifies
the bonds of the student to his school
and to his fellow student. But their
approach has been wrong.

The university has chosen Wash-
ington U. and Sewanee. And that is
the problem. Because of the similarity
in names, it would seem obvious to
start up a rivalry with Washington
U. And so annually, Washington is
the last team that the Generals play.
But how can a vibrant rivalry be
maintained with a team hundreds of
miles away? That's the reason no-
body gets exicited when the Bears
come to play.

Sewanee is a more logical choice.
It was chosen because of its many
common philosophies with WAL. It
is a conservative southern-oriented
liberal arts institution for gentlemen.
With alternating homecomings appear-
ances, this rivalry has, in recent
years, started to achieve a degree of
reality. But this year, the Purple
Tigers are coming to Lexington for
Parents’ weekend, An occasion that is
somewhat less than the emotion pack-
ed Homecomings. Another thing
which has always been holding this
rivalry down, is that it is confined
to football alone. The only
times the two schools meet
tournament draws which,

are in

sports, are quite irregular.

The solution to the problem (make
no mistake, this is a problem) is ob-
vious. With one or two exceptions,
the great rivalries are based on geo-
graphical factors. In Lexington, there
lie the makings of an unbeatable
rivalry: W&L and VMI.

On the surface, this idea sounds
utterly absurd. W&L abandoned
athletic subsidies completely, even
years ago. The VMI scholarship pro-
gram is quite healthy. Yet the dif-
ferences between the two school’s
athletic programs are not really so
remote. Just look at the General's
athletic schedules.

Last year, the Big Blue basketball
team played its first major college
opponent in ten years, East Carolina
U. ECU is in the same conference
as the Keydets, and fields hoop teams
of relatively the same calibre. This
year W&L’s basketball team will face
Navy, Guilford, and Elon (the last
two were ranked in the top twenty
national small colleges last year).
While the Generals may very well lose
all three of those games, is VMI any

better than them? It’s probably quite
a bit worse.

Football would probably seem the
biggest mismatch. So here some kind
of an annual scrimmage could be
set up. And yet, with that typical
optimism that seems to be creeping
into the W&L scheduling, the Gen-
erals are set to play Yale in the
Yale Bowl in 1970. Don’t try to say
the Ivies are all that bad. VMI foot-
ball has been pretty sad in recent
years and Princeton was thirteenth in
the nation not too long ago.

Some may say that such a rivalry
would get out of hand, and that it
would be detrimental to the co-opera-
tion between the two schools. But
such co-operation is only nominal,
this at least would bring the schools
into contact. If it’s true that the
rivalry would get too fierce, why not
have football and basketball scrim-

mages. There always used to be
competition in the other sports, let's
bring it back.

Give us a rival.

fraternity members comes within this
sphere of responsibility. (1 personally
would hope the EC has a similar
attitude towards the student body and
will take some action in regards to
this matter.)

As for the wording of the resolu-
tion, its meaning should be clear.
The IFC is not seeking to place any
blame upon individuals or institutions
but rather to find a quick solution to
a disturbing and important problem.
This resolution will be presented to
the girls’ schools in the area in hopes
that they will take appropriate cor-
rective action.

cedure for summer school work. But
to prevent confusion and to stand-
ardize policy on work done abroad,
the Foreign Study Committee recent-
ly obtained the authority to recom-
mend credit with the approval of the
appropriate department heads and
deans,

Dr. Dickens said that a_ get-to-

foreign study and would like to dis-
cuss aspects of living and studying in
a foreign country.

even a summer? Why not? Plan

The soccer game

end, Pfeiffer managed to get their
first real attack going. Captain Bob
Parry scored unassisted on a screen
shot.

When the second half opened, the
Generals took their revenge. After
being blocked on a feed from Hiatt,
Fechnay converted a pass from Yow
to give the lead back to W&L. Mo-
ments later, Fechnay scored his third
on the most beautiful effort of the
day.

Taking the ball around mid-field,
he dribbled around two defenders to
go in on a one-on-one. The shot,
taken from a sharp angle to the right,
just cut the edge of the net, as the
goalie never had a chance.
