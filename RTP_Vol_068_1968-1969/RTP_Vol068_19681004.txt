EC Discusses
New Schedules,
Plans For Year

At the Executive Committee meet-
ing last Tuesday night Student Body
President Jay Passavant called for
reports from the Student Control
Committee, the Curriculum Commit-
tee, the Cold Check Committee, and
the Assimilation Committee, all stu-
dent organizations,

Ray Hartzwell, chairman of the
Student Control Committee, said thus
far his committee had encountered
“no problems.” Hartwell said that
conventional dress in Evans Hall will
be strictly enforced this year. The
nine-member committee will meet
every Thursday night, and Hartwell
announced that when the freshman
class president is elected he will attend
the meetings.

Curriculum Committee Chairman
Swede Henberg indicated that the
W&L-Randolph-Macon seminar will
begin about Oct. 14. Henberg stated
that the seminar will be limited to
only 12 from each school yet any-
one from the student body may apply.
The students from Randolph-Macon
participating in the seminar will re-
ceive one hour credit; however, WAL
students will receive no credit.

Henberg also told EC members
that the Curriculum Committee would
strive this year to effect changes in
degree requirements and courses, some
of which he termed as being “out-
dated by 20 years.”

Glenn Moore, chairman of the Cold
Check Committee, informed the EC
that this year his committee would
send postcards as a warning to stu-
dents who have overdue accounts |
with local merchants. Moore said
that there would be a definite fine
scale for those students who fail to
respond to the postcards. Moore also
said that a letter would be circulated |
to all freshmen on Oct. 7 explaining
to them the nature of the Cold Check
Committee. The nine-member group
will meet every Thursday in Evans
Dining Hall at 6:45 p.m.

Last to report was Mike Pustay of
the Assimilation Commitiee who
spoke to the EC concerning the pep
rally to be held Oct. 18 in Red
Square at 7:00 p.m. Pustay said his
committee will work in conjunction
with the Varsity Club in the prepara-
tions. The EC voted the commitice
$375 which will be used to purchase
beer for the pep rally. The Assimila-
tion Committee will visit with fresh-
men in the dorms at 10:00 p.m. Oct.
7,

After the four committee reports,
Student Body Secretary Judson Sim
mons reported on the meeting of the |

ernments which he attended in ¢ har- |

In last Tuesday's edition of the
Ring-tum Phi, a resolution by IFC
treasurer Mark Eaker was made pub-
lic. This resolution stated that the
IFC was aware of the fact that
racial discrimination was prevalent in
a large number of the licensed lodg-
ing houses in Lexington. Deploring
| this fact, the resolution suggests that
the surrounding schools take “what-
| ever action that they may deem neces-
| sary for its correction,”

Troubs To Give

‘Exit the King’

Under The Direction Of Clinard

Washington and Lee's Troubadour
Theater. headed by Mr. Lee Kahn,
began rehearsals Wednesday night for
their production of Eugene lonesco’s
“Exit the King,” a presentation to
be directed by a WAL graduate, Noel
Clinard.

Clinard was a member of the Class |

of 1968. While at Washington and
Lee, he was a member of Beta Theta
| Pi social fraternity and of Phi Beta
| Kappa, Omicron Delta Kappa, and |
Who's Who in the American Col-
leges. He played three years of
varsity lacrosse and captained the
swimming team as a senior. In ad-
dition, he was an active member of
the Troubs. He begins a tour on the

United States Navy in December.

Ring-tum Phi Poll Traces
Discrimination In Lodging

that had existed previous to this year.

| Since they have no choice in the
girl's housing they cannot make de-
mands upon the hostess.

A solution to the problem has al-
ready been undertaken. The Friday
Ring-tum Phi conducted a telephone
survey among the hostesses last week
to determine whether or not they
‘would discriminate among the girls.
This list is being compiled and will
be presented to the IFC Monday
night. It will in turn be made avail-
able to the students of Washington
and Lee. Hollins College and Sweet-
briar College have similar lists which
they make available to their students.
By providing these lists a part of the
problem will be alleviated, it is hoped.

There has been talk of a possible
boycott against those hostesses who
practice discrimination, but consid-
ering the general attitude of the stu-
dent body, it is predicted such a
move would be unsuccessful.

Not An Ideal Situation’S

The results of the telephone poll (which appears on this
page) to licensed lodging homes in Lexington are quite sur-
prising. Twenty-five of the 52 contacts definitely stated they
would not or could not allow black students to stay in their
homes. Before we had decided to conduct this survey, we had
anticipated that many more would reject Negroes.

This is not to say that an ideal situation exists in Lexington.

Far from it. All of these homes should take in any students
without regard for race, creed or color. However, in spite ot
the fact these places are licensed by a state agency, there are
no laws—state or federal—which could force these homes to
keep Negroes. (Laws requiring integration of public lodging
homes deal with concerns larger than those in Lexington.)

At the same time the Ring-tum Phi does not feel that it
is our duty to try to impose (even if we could) integration on
these lodging homes. What we feel the Ring-tum Phi should
do is to inform the student bodies of this university and the
others concerned what the situation is. The best way to do
this we felt was to publish a list of the women who would keep
Negroes and those who would not. This would let Negro|-
students know where they are welcome.

Reflection on this matter led us to conclude that a pub-
lished list could have adverse affects. First, it might put some
of these women who will accept Negroes in an embarrassing
position within the community. To us this seems absurd and
should not even occupy our thoughts. But the fact remains
that Lexington is a closely-knit social community, often highly
critical of those who do not want to retain traditional beliefs
and customs. We felt that our whole purpose of opening up
homes might be hurt if some of the women changed their
minds and closed their homes when their names appeared in
print. In addition, others who might be considering opening
their homes to Negroes might dislike this tactic so much they
would remain closed.

Second, and more important, there are groups in this area
which might terrorize and intimidate the women who welcome
Negroes.

To keep this list from falling into the wrong hands we will
turn it over the Interfraternity Council so that this body may
make it available to the neighboring girls’ schools. The girls’
schools could use this list as they see fit, even to the extent of
boycotting the places that will not accept Negroes.

For our part, we believe that the Washington and Lee stu-
dent body should cooperate in this effort by asking their dates
not to stay in segregated housing. Only in this way will the
situation be rectified.

Plan A--Best For W&L

The first faculty meeting of the year is scheduled on Mon-
day. With it comes the inevitable “busywork” which must be
cleared up before the faculty can discuss more important mat-
ters. The most important matter they will bring up is the
formulation of a five-day week.

Plan A (see diagram on this page) is the most advantage-
ous for Washington and Lee. Besides being the one which we
can switch to (hopefully next semester) with the least number
of complications, there will be no conflict with classroom space,
and afternoon classes will meet only twice a week—on Monday
and Thursday. In addition, this plan is flexible enough to
enable courses to meet for longer periods and leaves many
possibilities for adding new courses to the curriculum with a
minimum of conflicts.

A decision will not be made at Monday’s meeting. Instead,
the faculty will probably schedule a special meeting and dis-
solve into a committee-of-the-whole to discuss the plans. We
urge the f faculty to decide as soon as possible which five- day
plan is best suited to the W&L campus. It has long
overdue.

Open Housing: Responsibility Of Students

ing here if we took colored.”

These women are providing a ser-
vice to the school community, and
}as such have a responsibility to pro-
| vide that service equally and fairly to
all who are willing to pay, Randolph-
Macon and the other girls’ schools
also have a_ responsibility to their
students to make sure that they do
not do anything to encourage such a
disgraceful and undignified treatment
of any of its students. It is this re-
sponsibility which the administrations
of these schools have so neatly and
quietly abrogated by what is known
as “passing the buck.”

By abolition of an approved hous-
ing list, the schools have lost by
default their position to apply the
pressure of a threat of removal from
the approved housing list any house
which discriminates against its stu-
dents because of race. The administra-
tions have thus quietly and neatly
washed their hands of the responsi-
bility. It is now up to the student
bodies of the girls’ schools to apply
the only leverage they can. I firmly
believe that tangible results would be

End Saturday Classes:

The Top Three Proposals

This Monday the faculty will meet
to discuss proposed plans for a five-
day week, Last spring, a committee
was appointed to consider the aboli-
tion of Saturday classes and to
present the faculty with their feel-
ings. The result of the deliberations
of this committee was a report to the
faculty which contained five plans
lettered A through E.

Plans A, B, and C meet the two
requirements of the resolution by
the faculty: Monday through Friday
classes from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m. Plans
D and E fulfill only the 8 a.m. to
4 p.m. requirement.

Ihe committee's report stated
it was unable to agree on any
of the five plans presented, but tak
ing both first and second choices into
consideration, plan A had more sup
port by the group than the other
four plans. The report went on to
state that it gave no support to
plan C, which was a modification of
the “Lynchburg” plan, which the
Ring-tum Phi presented last year

The three plans illustrated to the
left are the plans that faculty will
probably study in the greatest depth.
Each plan features the abolition of
Saturday but differ in the
hours and arrangement of class time
during the week.

Plan A

Plan A schedules classes to begin
at 8 am. and end at 4 p.m. and
includes a SO0-minute lunch period
and a five-minute break between
classes. This plan is somewhat similar
to our present plan of class schedul-
ing and would involve little adjust-
ment by the students and faculty. It
also includes a larger number of
periods for scheduling courses com-
pared to the other plans under con-
sideration, thereby providing a wider
field of choice of courses without con-

classes,

flict by students. Compared to the

other plans presented, plan A has
