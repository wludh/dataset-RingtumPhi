‘The way

I see it’

(Editor's note: “The way I see it”
is a column of general editorial
comment for which contributions
are solicited from students and
faculty concerning any topic.)

By JIM HAMILL

No subject is approached with more
trepidation as Spring arrives than a
defense of W&L against those who
favor coeducation. One recent colum-
nist of the “Phi” has rather safely
observed that girls add to the aesthetic
character of the campus. Not to
wholeheartedly agree with this senti-
ment would be foolhardy. But what-
ever the merits of this kind of wish-
ful-thinking, there are more pragmatic
issues to be met if we carry coeduca-
tion beyond the phase of wish ful-
fiillment.

This article suggests a second look
at coeducation. It argues that coeduca-
tion will require a whole new defini-

tion of what W&L is or what in
strives to be. Lusty student voices in
favor of an immediate deluge of
women should not be thought to

justify coeducation without considera-
tion of some of the inherent difficul-
ties.

A few central presumptions have
characterized W&L’s reputation, and
these are neither surprising nor often
contested. We have traditionally never
seen ourselves as the end of the
education process, but as a kind of
preparatory school for postgraduate
training. One has only to point to the
percentage of graduates who become
professional people—lawyers,  busi-
nessmen, professors, and more re-
cently, doctors. In other words, Wash-
ington and Lee is by and large an
institution for men who intend to
become professionals in these fields
after some graduate education at
another institution, Of the graduates
of the School of Commerce and Ad-
ministration, some 75 per cent eventu-
ally continue their education, and for
the University as a whole, the per-
centage is at least 50 per cent. Law
school is the leading choice for both
groups.

The correlation between this and
the issue of coeducation lies in an
examination of how many women fit

into this kind of definition of Wash-!

ington and Lee. Isolating statistics of
those attending graduate schools in
business and law, one gets evidence
of the male dominance in graduate
education, In seven so-called prestigi-
ous business graduate schools (Co-
lumbia, Cornell, Harvard, Michigan,
Northwestern, Pennsylvania, and
Stanford), there are enrolled $533 men
and 126 women (2.2 per cent). Choos-
ing five equally eminent law schools
(Harvard, Michigan, New York Uni
versity, Stanford and Yale), one finds

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Mass student voice needed to catch faculty ear

By STAMAN OGILVIE
Sophomore Executive Committeeman

Student opinion is a strange com-
modity on the W&L campus. You
hear it breathed in the Co-op over
coffee or dealt with lightly in the
fraternity houses over choice ale or
propounded twice weekly in the
Ring-tum Phi or surveyed searchingly
in late night dorm sessions. But try
to get quantitative measure of stu-
dent opinion and it is as manifest as
a lipstick trace on the back of Gov-
ernor Wallac’s neck. In short, here-
tofore we have rarely been able to
martial indicative student sentiment
in quantitative terms.

Today we have a new situation, a
new responsibility, and, | think, a
new impetus to action. Faculty mem-
bers, in their recent vetoing of the
E.C.’s_ independent exam schedule
proposal, expressed sentiment that in
light of the amount of revision that
has been proposed and accepted in
all areas of campus affairs this year
they would be interested in: 1) stu-
dent response to the tack the Uni-
versity has taken and 2) measurable
student support for future action, a
response that should have a broader
base than the opinion of twelve Ex-
ecutive Committeemen and several
newspaper columnists. All of the pre-
ceding sentence-book being a long-
winded euphemism which translates:
no one in faculty or administration is
absolutely sure that what we of the
E.C, say you say is really your sayso.

Enter the reports of the faculty and
student Curriculum Committees.
Months of work and consideration
have gone into the preparation of the
plan (copies of which have been
dirceted to your fraternity house, the
Co-op, and the Commons). It outlines
possible revisions in the university
calendar, graduation requirements,
and distribution guidelines, As you
know, it suggests the innovation of a
short semester to fall in the middle
or at the end of the year for the
purpose of independent in-depth study
which would better tailor education
experience to the benefit and chal-
lenge of individual students. It recom-
mends conversion to the type system
that other schools all over the country
are using to attract the highest quality
high school graduates,

With regard to distribution, the
Curriculum Committee has published
a majority and a minority opinion
both of which call for a reclassifica-
tion of courses into four divisions.
The minority proposal calls for more
rigid adherence to distribution re-
quirements, requiring 46 credits as
contrasted with the majority's 36
credit minimum suggestion. Toe de-
velop adequate expertise for the
further discussion of the plans re-
quires careful reading of the brief
four and one-half page printed sum-
mary which you should have.

Today's R-tP presents some interest-
ing data on this and other current
subjects of interest. But as always
before, the students response to Mon-
day's poll was disappointing in mass
terms. Those who did respond ex-
pressed a clear-cut preference for a
short term and mixed reaction to-
ward distribution requirements (this
latter due in part to a lack of informa-

 

tion on the specifics of the Curriculum
Committee proposals). The Tuesday
Ring-tum Phi has taken the logical
first step in stirring slumbering stu-
dent opinion.

Now here are some candid facts
that had better elicit a little adrenalin
secretion. The faculty is awfully tired
of trying to better academic oppor-
tunities for a student body that will
not express its opinions on change.
I sensed this in an independent exam
session with them last Monday. The
curriculum revisions that general
sentiment favors will be defeated if
we do not take a meaningful and
unified position in their favor. With
student demand the proposal will
pass. It’s as simple as that.

Washington and Lee University has
nothing attractive to offer prospective
students unless it is the personal at-
tention to academic needs that our
size permits us, In 1969 American
education has progressed to a point
where modified distribution require-
ments and short term independent
study are necessary for the most re-
warding educational — experiences.
Look and see where the college ap-
plications are going. It’s alarming.
Our current system fetters the indi-
viduality of education that we are
capable of offering.

 

You may have voted yesterday in
the Ring-tum Phi poll. Good. But
I ask you to do this, Take the printed
report and read it over for several
minutes. Discuss its implications with
friends. This issue is vital enough
that you will want to be fully in-
formed to make a decision. Thurs-
day when you vote for the Big
Four offices, take time to mark the
accompanying ballot concerning cur-
riculum revision, The E.C. will sum-
marize the results and present them
directly and personally to each faculty
member, Student opinion can be the
decisive factor in modernizing W&L
curriculum. We always cry for an
enhanced position in the decision-
making process. Well, what we have
here is an opportunity to take an
enhanced position in the decision-
making process. Curriculum revision
will affect many of us in the uni-
versity now. It will unquestionably
determine the success or failure of
Washington and Lee’s future. This
is the most important question that
will confront the university while we
are here. To shirk our responsibility
in creating a stronger Washington
and Lee is to admit the decease of
student opinion and competence. Vote
on Thursday,

 

Rock-gospel to come

To the ordinary Washington and
Lee student, it might seem that
Springs weekend and the University
Federation of Christian Concern don’t
exactly go hand in hand, but the
UFOCC is out to prove him wrong.
In a rather unprecedented step, the
Federation is bringing a rock-gospel
group to Lexington for a Saturday
afternoon concert. At 4:30 in the
afternoon when some students are re-
turning with their dates from Goshen,
and others are whiling away the
time before dinner, the “Sons of
Thunder” will begin their concert on
the lawn in front of Lee Chapel.

The concert is the latest of several
innovations and programs launched
by the Federation. It is seen as an
opportunity to entertain the students
and their dates, make them aware of
the UFOCC and its mission, and to
impart a religious note to the week-
end.

The “Sons of Thunder” is a mixed
group made up of three men and
two girls, all students in either the
D.C. area or in North Carolina.
Their professionalism, however, is un-
questionable. The group has cut sev-
eral albums and made a great many
concert tours, They write all of their
own songs, and do their own arrang-
ing. Both men, Blaine Smith and Don
Williamston were formerly members
of the “Newports.”

While their sound is typical of a
modren rock group, their lyrics are
concerned with the relevance of relig-
ion in their lives and in the world
today. As Smith points out, “Our
music, which is all original, is drawn
from popular rock and folk. Our
purpose is to use the medium of
popular music to discuss not only

 

Virginia Museum play on Dylan

Thomas shouldn’t be passed up

The performance of “In Search of
Dylan,” to be presented in Lee Chapel
Thursday night, gives the Washing-
ton and Lee student a rare opportunity
to see a first class professional drama.
“In Search of Dylan,” a presentation
of The Virginia Museum, is cur-
rently on a month-long tour of the
state that will take it to 21 com-
munities, The play opened to an en-
thusiastic crowd in Richmond, April
;

“In Search of Dylan” is a biography
of the talented but tragic poet Dylan
Thomas. The play traces his life from
his boyhood days in Wales, through
his productive years, age 16-19 when
he wrote most of his poetry, to his
dissolution in his later years.

The play gives the audience both
an insight into the works of the poet
and a study in self-destruction of a
man who literally drank himself to
death.

The story line of the play, the
rise and fall of Thomas, is unfortu-
nately broken by two innovations
thrown in at the end.

A scene from Thomas’ highly suc-
cessful play “Under Milkwood” is
presented near the end of the play,
at a time that it ruins the sequence
of events by causing too great an
interruption. After the Richmond per-
formance, director Frederick Rolf
indicated that the scene might either
be done earlier or eliminated com-
pletely. li is hoped that the scene
can somehow be saved because if
gives a good insight into Thomas

The play ends with a unique tse

 

Although interesting and indeed mov-
ing, this scene cannot avoid the
stigma of superficiality.

Until these two divisions, a sharp
and witty script and excellent acting
had lifted the play from one new
height to another,

The cast of four includes Douglas
Watson as Thomas and Kay Britten,
Frank Groceclose and Brian Gilmar
in multiple roles.

Gilmar, an Englishman, gives the
finest performance in taking several
comedy roles, Watson, a veteran of
27 Broadway plays, and Groceclose,
a native Virginian, are also excellent.
Miss Britien, whose roles include
Catlin Thomas, the poet's long-suf-
fering wife, overacts at times.

Miss Britten wrote the play, and
contributes to its success with voice
and guitar, Her drawback as an
actress are compensated for by the
songs she wrote into the script for
herself.

The state is fortunate to have such
an organization as The Virginia Mu-
seum, the nation’s first statewide arts
system. The work of the Museum
should be familiar to the WAL stu-
dent by the frequent appearances in
Lexington of the Artmobile, which is
currently in the city displaying Byzan
tine treasures. The Virginia Museum
also sponsored the appearance of the
Abbey Singers at Lee Chapel earlier
in the year

The chance to see a performance
of the calibre of “In Search of Dylan”

is all too rare in Lexington. Students attitude
with any interest in drama should/ stable wanting a cleansing

of slides and commentary on Thomas, ; not pass 1 up.

 

i

current problems of today, but also
to suggest answers for some of them.”

The “Sons of Thunder” have ap-
peared on many major college cam-
puses to date, and on each oc-
casion they were very warmly receiv-
ed. In this area they have given
concerts at Georgetown University,
the University of Maryland, American
University, and High Point College.

Admission to the concert will be
free in order to attract as many
people as possible to a performance
given for their enjoyment and benefit.
Should their reception be as good as
is anticipated the Federation will
likely plan similar concerts with
other groups for various times dur-
ing the next school year.

In the event of inclement weather,
the concert will be given in Lee
Chapel.

Religion is living on WGL
campus in several forms

By GLENN AZUMA
Assistant Editorial-Page Editor

College days are traditionally a
time when home ties are loosened. It
is also a time when the typical college
student drifts from the church of his
parents and his childhood, experi-
menting with others or simply re-
jecting all. For some this action is
conscious and deliberate for others
it is not so easily recognized. In
either case the act seems to be a
natural trend at a natural time. The
question arises: Is the W&L man,
like the typical student, drifting from
religion? This question was directed
to Dr. L. Hodges, Professor of Relig-
ion. Dr. Hodges:

“It seems to me that before such
a question can be taken up the ques-
tion of what religion is must first be
satisfied. | think religion must be

Music clubs’ concerts end

The Washington and Lee Glee
Club and Brass Choir returned Sun-
day night from their annual Spring
Concert Tour. During the course of
the four day trip, the men sang and
played for five different audiences,
one of which was more than one
thousand strong.

At two schools, the men were the
guests of female choirs which had
given concerts at WAL earlier in the
school year. Thursday evening saw
the clubs perform with the female
choir before the student body of
Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa.
After the concert, the men were the
guests of the Wilson Choir as the
girls threw a party for them. Then,
on Saturday, the men joined the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania's “Pennsyng-
ers” (the girls’ choir) in a public
concert on their campus and partied
with them that night.

In between these concerts, the clubs
performed before the more-than-one-
thousand crowd of patients at the
Philadelphia State Hospital, a mental
institution, as well as the student
body of Blair Academy of Blairstown,

held on Sunday evening on the trip
back to Lexington. The clubs stopped
at the Foxcroft School, a girls’ board-
ing school in the deep woods near
Middleburg, Virginia.

The programs given included some
Broadway show tunes, folk songs,

of the machine

over much with the system of honor
and its definition and ignore the crea-
tion of honor itself

defined largely in terms of what Paul
Tillich has said, that is, a final con-
cern or ultimate commitment.
“Under that definition everybody
at W&L is religious, in that everyone
has some kind of ultimate commit-
ment. Not everyone has a church
commitment, neither does everyone
have a commitment to a traditional
faith. | feel there are many signs
that religion is not at all dead at
WAL, even established religions.
“I've observed in many, many
instances that during the college years
people are doing things other than
attending organized services of wor-
ship. They are not as involved in
church affairs. However, there are
many, many functional substitutes.

“The ultimate concern of most men
is to live in some type of close com-
munity. There are many functional
substitutes for the church, one is the
student body as a whole. We are
members of a de facto community,
we associate with each other.

“We have common interests, com-
mon concerns, having our own com-
mon rituals at athletic events, lec-
tures, university assemblies, and other
various events. Fraternities and other
organizations on campus are func-
tional substitutes for ecclesiastical
bodies. | think you'll find that within
the college these alternative organiza-
tions make the churches seem less
and less necessary.

“In observing men in the under-
graduate school | think they tend to
lose interest in eccesiastical estab-
lishments and get more interested in
other establishments. It is very in-
teresting that the people who are
most rebellious against established
bodies create their own. They pro-
mote fraternities or other organiza-
tions. | think after the college years
people in our culture tend to go back
into a church existence.”

There also exists on campus many
instances of spontaneous religious
attitudes. A few groups in the Fresh-
man Old Dorm meet occassionally
for prayer and meditation. The presi-
dent of the student body, Jay Passa-
vant, and a few of his associates has
organized a “prayer breakfast” with
faculty members, Within the university

establishmentarianism, but a renais-
sunce of those now almost forgotten
virtues of gentlemantliness, which, in
addition to holding one’s liquor might
include honor, and courtesy, and even
amiability and cleanliness. Let us
resurrect, too, the values of scholar-
ship—curiosity, quality, and virtue
(not alphabet) being its own reward.

Some of this Utopia-on-the-Maury
must be subcontracted to the faculty
and administration. The ABC pocket
rule is not the only means of measure-
ment and catechism classes are too
often easy escape taken by our dis-
tinguished lecturers. The ambiance
created by these practices is certainly
not intellectual.

But most blame lies with those who
confuse the holding of power and the
using of it, We students plug our-
selves into institutions and bask in the

exists several organizations who are
of a religious nature. One of the
most important of these is the
U.F.O.C.C. (University Federation of
Christian Concern),

In speaking of this organization,
Dr. Hodges said, “We are a voluntary
association of students, faculty and
ministers who are a very loosely
organized institution doing loosely
organized activities.” He went on to
say that the university wishes to ful-
fill the religious needs of the faculty
and students in whatever way it can.
However, it does not wish to initiate
and direct programs unless student
interest is demonstrated. The univer-
sity is prepared to lend financial and
organizational assistance if such an
interest is shown. It is toward such
an end and under such a policy that
these organizations operate in the uni-
versity.

The Generals had to utilize their
final at-bat in the botiom of the
ninth inning to overcome Oneonta |
State. Big Blue had successfully come |
back from an early five run deficit}
through power hitting and fine coach- |
ing.

In the first inning WAL quickly
put Oneonta State out in order with
two strike-outs by the Freshman start-
er Bill Miller. Ray Coates the lead-off
batsman for Washington and Lee
promptly hit the first pitch for an
in the park home run.

This single run lead was sufficient
until the Generals were bombed in
the fourth inning by six runs. With
the contest less than half completed
the home nine started chipping away
at that big lead.

Two big runs came through an im
pressive exhibilion of power by
WAL's outfielders. Jim Wilson laced
a deep one to right center for a
double. Then strongman Scott Me
Chrystal cleared the center fleld bar

enrolled 4,759 men and 345 women
(6.7 per cent).

The point is that women do not
usually choose to attend graduate
schools in fields W&L emphasizes.
That is to say, women do not want
to pursue careers in law, business,
politics, and medicine. Though it
might be pointed out that fewer
women qualify for admission to these
kinds of graduate schools, it is also
true that in similar analysis of prestigi-
ous graduate schools in education and
art, women constitute a considerable
percentage of those attending. This
invites the observation that men and
women share entirely different inter-
ests for entirely different reasons,

It is also fruitful to take a look
at those fields which do seem to
interest female students. At about
twenty girls’ schools examined, in-
cluding the “Seven Sisters,” and all
those in Virginia, there is a separate
Department of Education, usually one
of the largest departments in the cata-
log. The courses which are offered
aim at producing teachers, advisors
and counselors for primary, second-
ary, and “special” education. Women
traditionally dominate in these fields.
Also, at most of the girls’ schools
studied one finds majors available i in

way through the game the visitors
took the offense. Oneonta State spray-
ed a few balls to the outfield and the
lead changed hands 2-1.

But Oneonta State wasn't through
yet. The visitors exploded for seven
runs in the eighth inning. In the last
two innings W&L staged rallys and
two additional tallys were made. But
these runs were too little too late as
Oneonta posted the win 9-3.

WA&L’s main problem was off and

ture, painting, and always drama and
speech, This could be said to demon-
strate heavy female interest in the
fine arts fields. While W&L students
enroll in large numbers in fine arts
courses, one suspects that the dif-
ference is that girls tend towards the
partcipatory arts rather than the art
history courses predominating here.
It is true that new emphasis is being
given fine arts at W&L,. Next year
a drama major will be instituted, and
several new courses will be offered.
Still, it can be argued that W&L’s
fine arts program would be hardly
comparable to the extensive and large
programs at most girls’ schools,

| have tried to demonstrate that
women are not interested in the fields
in which W&L traditionally has prid-
ed itself—commerce, pre-law, eco-
nomics, history, and pre-med, all of
these being preparatory to postgradu-
ate education. Girls, who do not
usually seek any postgraduate train-
ing, seem to prefer the arts, humani-
ties, and teacher training, some of
which fields are inadequately repre-
sented at W&L or not represented at
all. There is independent evidence to
support these conclusions. Frederick

| desirably low
| is because women are satisfied with
|a generalized

acteristics of Woman's College Stu-
dents under the auspices of the South-
ern Regional Education Board. In a
survey of background, environment,
and personality of students at Hollins,
Randolph-Macon, and Sweet Briar,
Dr. Rowe observes:

At all three schools there is little
sign of a practical, vocational, or
pre-professional orientation; rather,
the emphasis seems to be on in-

terest and achievement in the
humanities, social sciences, and
arts. (p. 44).

Comparing girls’ schools to one
another in some detail, a more dis-
turbing condition also was observed
by Dr. Rowe. Rowe gives data in-
dicating a relatively low interest in
scholarship as compared with very
high interest in “friendliness, loyalty,
and group welfare.” As a statement
relative to female attitudes towards
the academic environment, Dr. Rowe’s
conclusions appear to point again to
a lesser interest among women in
the professional life or in postgradu-
ate training characteristic of the em-
phasis of this institution.

Further, a faculty-student commit-
tee at Lindenwood Women’s College
in St. Charles, Missouri, has observed
that women are less inclined than
men to remain at college for a full
four years, which results in an un-
“retention rate.” This

two year education,
decide to get married, or otherwise
enter society at an earlier time than
for men. At Linwood, this four year
atrition is 37 per cent.

It is the belief of this writer that
coeducation will require an almost

| total reorganization of the curriculum

structure, deemphasizing significantly
the role of Washington and Lee as
a postgraduate preparatory school for
professional men in various fields. It
will also require new stress on areas
WAL does not now regard in the
same light as it does pre-law, com-
merce, and pre-med,

Curriculum changes have been
much in the news around W&L, but
I don't think these curriculum de-
bates have centered around a funda-
mental change in the emphasis of
WAL preparatory education as much
as a strengthening of its current em-
phasis. In any event, few could argue
with any certainty or plausibility that
women can be simply fitted into the

present academic structure of W&L,
unless one is speaking of a mere
handful, like the 34 who attend
Harvard Business School with 1830
men, Under the present circumstances,
the really highly qualified women will
apply somewhere else than W&L,
which does not offer what they are
interested in. Those women im will
apply nevertheless may force a low-
ering of admissions standards because
of coeducation for its own sake, If
we speak of real coeducation, let's
also speak of a complete reform of
the curriculum as well as a funda-
mental redefinition of the role of this
university in maintaining high stand-
ards in preparatory training for post-
graduate work. Some would advocate
this kind of change and redefinition,
I would not. It deprives the Uni-
versity of its chief distinction; it
yields prestige and reputation to social
pressure; and it surrenders the func-
tion of the preparatory school for
post-gradutes, making W&L merely
another one of hundreds of “good”
undergraduate small colleges and uni-
versities.

The President's Panel on Higher
Education, headed by McGeorge
Bundy has emphasized the unique
position of the small liberal arts col-
lege. It has pointed towards the need
for these colleges to pursue a dis-
tinct course which differentiates them
from other kinds of institutions. The
panel concludes, in part, “unless the
private college program is significantly
different, it doesn’t deserve to sur-
vive.” Washington and Lee's dis-
tinctive kind of pre-graduate school
preparation for men meets this type
of criteria. Its character in this re-
gard should be retained.
