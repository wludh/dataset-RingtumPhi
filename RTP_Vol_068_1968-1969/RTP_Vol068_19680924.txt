Chairman,
IFC Deferred Rush Committee

Rush weck 1968, while noteworthy
for several reasons, was of particular
interest because it
served as a clear
warning to the
rushees of the fu-
ture. This year’s
rush may well have
been the last of ©
its kind, as de-
ferred rush is be-
ing introduced next
year and will prob-
ably be permanent
unless it proves a
dismal failure. The
problems encountered in rush week
this year (though probably small when
compared to those of the next sys-
tem) should be kept in mind by all

Macon-W &L seminar plans
to study intimate possibility
of joint curricula program

An experimental seminar consist-
ing of Washington and Lee and Ran-
dolph-Macon Woman's College stu-
dents will again be conducted this
fall. The seminar was initiated last
spring by the Randolph-Macon stu-
dent government and sponsored here
by Phi Eta Sigma and the Student
Curriculum Committee. The seminar
plans to meet every other week at
alternating schools, with the host
school providing one or more pro-
fessors to lead the evening's discus-
sion.

The purpose of these experimental
sessions is twofold: first, to explore
the feasability of such joint seminars
with the possibility in mind that such
seminars may become a part of the
accredited curricula of both schools
in the near future; second, to explore

the value of the interdisciplinary ap- |

proach to a given topic or problem.

Applications for participation in
this semester's seminar are now be-
ing accepted. They should contain
grade-point average, major, and
special interests. The applications
should be submitted to Swede Hen-
berg at Pi Kappa Alpha no later than
this Friday.

Lobby and workshop wings near completion

 

Robert Edward Royall Huntley's
inaugural plans are now being finaliz-
ed. The inaugural activities commence
Friday, October 17 with an informal
reception at the President’s House
and the Evan's Dining Hall from
9 to 10 p.m.

The following morning, the twen-
tieth inaugural ceremony will take
place at 11 a.m. on the front lawn—
weather permitting.

The acaedmic procession will in-
clude the president and the speaker;
members of the Board of Trustees;
delegates and official representatives
of colleges, universities, learned so-
cieties, and foundations; members of
the Alumni Board of Directors and
its past presidents; and the faculty and
representatives of the 46 alumni chap-
ters, class agents, and dignitaries of
the Commonwealth of Virginia.

University nets
increased gifts

A program based on communica-
tion as well as a plea for contribu-
tions has resulted in larger collections
by the Alumni Association Fund and
the Parents’ Fund. In both of these
areas, the contributions exceeded the
amount received last year and the
goals set for this year.

The Alumni Fund's goal last year
was $225,000, but only $210,655 was
collected. This year, however, the
goal set at $250,000 was exceeded;
total contributions were $277,771.

The Parents’ Fund, although it has
no goal, is showing an amount almost
double that of last year. Last year's
contributions were $13,800; this year,
parents gave more than $24,900,

The Robert E. Lee Associates, an
organization comprised of people who
have contributed $1000 or more,
added 106 people to its ranks. Their
total contributions came to $197,231.

 

According to Farris Hotchkiss, as-
| sociate director of university develop-
ment, no goals have been set for
| mext year’s drive. The Alumni Board
| of Directors will meet October 18
'to set the goal, which will be in-
creased. A further attempt at better
communication with the parents and
/the alumni will be made, with the
stress on the personal approach.

 

I naugural committee adds
finishing touches to plans

be a luncheon for the delegates at
1:15 p.m. in the Evans Dining Hall,
The Inaugural Committee was ap-
pointed by President Huntley and has
planned the program. This commit-
tee is composed of Leon F. Sensa-
baugh (chairman), Sidney M. B.
Coulling, J. Paxton Davis, Edwin C.
Griffith, William M. Hinton, Thomas
Cc. Imeson, James G. Leyburn,
Charles P. Light, Frank A. Parsons,
Jay Passavant, William W. Pusey,
James H. Starling, William C. Wash-

James W. Whitehead.

The true beginning phase of the
inauguration will take place on Thurs-
day evening in Lee Chapel with a
concert to be given by the Hungarian
Quartet for the pleasure of the num-
erous visiting dignitaries and dele-
gates.

This twentieth inaugural ceremony
will mark the first time in the two
hundred and twenty year history of
Washington and Lee in which the

Danford Fellowships will
offer financial assistance
for prospective teachers

Applications for Danforth Fellow-
ships for graduate study are now be-
ing accepted by Dean Farrar, the
liaison officer for the Danforth Fel-
lowships on campus. The fellowships
are offered by the Danforth Founda-
tion of St. Louis. These fellowships
are open to college graduates who
wish to continue their education and
who have a serious interest in col-
lege teaching as a career.

Approximately 120 fellowships will
be awarded in March of 1969. They
will be eligible for four years of
financial assistance, with maximum
annual living stipend of $2400 for
single and $2950 for married fel-
lows, plus tuition and fees.

The Danforth Foundation was
created in 1927 by the late Mr. and
Mrs. William Danforth as a_ phil-
anthropy devoted to giving aid and
encourangement to persons, to em-
phasizing the humane values that
come from a religious and democratic
heritage, and to strengthening the
essential quality of education.

as Troubadour Theatre begins new season

Improved facilities and an experi-
mental program mark the upcoming
season at the Troubadour Theatre.
The addition of a lobby and a work-
shop and the installation of an up-
to-date heating system will provide
the old building with a degree of
comfert and efficiency. Formation of
what Troubadour director Lee Kahn
calls an “intermedia group” will add
a new dimension

 

The lobby is scheduled for comple-
tion by October 30, opening night of
the first Troubadour production, A
somewhat later date is set for the
completion of the workshop, although,
since this wing will house the heat-
ing unit, the walls and ceiling will
be up soon. The old staircase is also

being replaced; offices and a dressing |

room will occupy the second floor

*

——

 

For the first time in its history,
the Troubadour Theatre will have an
intermedia program. When asked the
definition of “intermedia,” Mr. Kahn
stated: “Intermedia can best be de-
scribed as environmental theatre; that
is, some form of skit or play which
is impromptu in appearance, but
nevertheless carefully planned.”

Intermedia performances may be
held at any time and ai any place
As Mr. Kahn put it, “Someday the
Ring-tum Phi might carry an an-
nouncement saying: ‘at such-and-such
a time and at such-and-such a place,

Lintermedia will happen.’ The Troub-
-ladour director made

it clear that,
even if no audience materializes, in-
termedia would take place for the
benefit of the performers themselves

Lugene lonesco’s “Exit the King’
is the first scheduled Troubadour pro
duction; it will run from October 30
to November 2. The second play in

4 the Troubadour program is an adap-

tion of Euripides’ “The Bacchae” by
Dr. Keith Shillington. Second semes
ter, the Troubadours will present
“America Hurrah!” by Jean Claude
van Itaille, and another “spotlight
production,” an undisclosed play by
an unknown author

This Thursday, the Troubs will hold
their first staff meeting. To comple-

ment its improved facilities, the
Troubadour Theatre will also enjoy
a large membership this year. Besides
returning upperclassmen, thirty-eight

freshman have expressed to Mr. Kahn
an interest in working for the Theaire

The natural bridge

Uppermost in the minds of the faculty in requiring de-
ferred rush was the belief that the present system retards
assimilation into a college atmosphere. Assuming then that the
faculty and administration are interested in the early impres-
sions made upon freshmen, we urge that freshman camp in
Natural Bridge, Va., be seriously questioned as to it values
ot drawbacks in this regard.

Freshman camp is a depressing and unnecessary preface
to a college career, a psychological degradation whose worth-
while components could more easily be absorbed in Lexington.
At one time it was believed that freshman camp promoted
class unity and spirit, afforded a mini-vacation to ease tension
before the start of classes, and decimated the likelihood of pre-
rush-week rush. None of these is now a factor.

Freshmen are forced to sleep two to a bed in cold rooms,
spend their time listening to an array of speeches as their
counselors loll in the grass (bored), and play games on teams
whose unity approaches zero. Few of those who attend are
impressed, and a vacation freshman camp is not.

As for dangerous exposure to evil upperclassmen, we have
advocated and will continue to speak in favor of free, open,
total contact for freshmen with all other Washington and Lee
students as the only fair assimilation—and a wholly valuable
one. In addition, the absence of rush next September affords
an excellent opportunity to abandon freshman camp and adopt
University-based orientation.

There is another argument in favor of retaining camp, that
freshmen are compelled, if by logistics alone, to attend all the
meetings. This could easily be handled in Lexington by invok-
ing the cautions of the Honor System.

Orientation is an integral phase of assimilation which could
better be accomplished on the campus. Freshmen would still
be able to attend talks by faculty members and students and
the welcoming addresses, would have the benefits of counsel-
ing in their own rooms, and would definitely be less likely to
spend two miserable nights and two harried days in what most
of them regard as an extreme absurdity.

A breach of tradition

Among students and alumni of Washington and Lee there
is an emotion approaching pride in the several traditions of
the University. Of the three most publicized—the Honor
System, coat and tie dress, and speaking to everyone on
campus—only the Honor System deserves being labeled a
tradition.

The speaking “tradition” has all but died, perhaps be-
cause there are too many people to speak to or perhaps be-
cause it’s no longer sophisticated to do so.

As for the wearing of coats and ties, this tradition will not
die because some choose not to follow it. It may, however,
cease to be a tradition if it must be enforced.

The loss of fining powers by the Assimilation Committee
three years ago was in tradition’s behalf. Any custom, if it is
to become tradition, must be voluntary: if one is made to wear

a tie, then the tradition will not be that of wearing ties but |

rather of being made to wear them.

A specific case is the enforcement of conventional dress
in the dining hall by dormitory counselors, who have among
them what amounts to the right of sanctioned harassment.
Let there be no mistake—we ourself are dressed in coat and
tie every day; we are not, though, so attired on pain of being
denied a meal. It must certainly be inspiring to freshmen to
have a dormitory counselor invoke a childish regulation under
the respectable guise of tradition.

Toward a better library

It would be an understatement to say that everyone wel-
comes the initial volley of changes in McCormick Library;
the feeling contains a great deal of amazement. In reversing
a good many policies followed in previous years, Mr. Leach
has completely opened the library—physically as well as in its

attentiveness to the students and faculty. We look forward to |

the library's approaching total integration with the needs of
Washington and Lee.

To the students

This will be a student newspaper, which it has not always
been. In the past, contributions from those not on the staff
received somewhat less than just consideration. This year,
every shade of student opinion may be brought to light—not
only on the second page, but also in the first regular column
of editorial comment printed on the front page by a Virginia
college newspaper.

In our efforts to make the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi a true
student paper, we have not forgotten that it must be read, We
invite criticism and contributions of any nature, and will make
a genuine effort to provide total coverage of University events.

We do not promise to publish every article, notice, or
letter received, Our task is to serve the Washington and Lee
community, which necessitates selectivity, demands compet-
ence, and is based on fairness. We hope to provide all three.

 

 

Doc’s and Lyric

Theatre gam

new managements and facades

By REED BYRUM
Managing Editor

An air of change has indeed spread
throughout Lexington; on campus,
Robert E. R. Huntley assumes the
presidency of Washington and Lee
next month, while around the town
two traditional standard-bearers, Doc
of the Corner Grill and Ed Side of
The Lyric Theater have ceased work-
ing to go into retirement.

After twenty-three years of faith-
ful and congenial service to the stu-
dents of W&L and VMI, Carl “Doc”
Collett sold out his business this past
month to “take it easy for a while.”
Doc felt that his age was the most
compelling factor in his decision and
that now he cannot do as much as
he had been doing: he vows, however,
that after a sufficient rest period he
will return to work of a much less
demanding sort than his previous line.

In his close to two and a_ half
decades in Lexington, Doc and his
wife have become _ institutionalized
traditions of W&L. They have lived
and grown with the school and with
its progress have also advanced. They
added both the back-room and the
taproom during the past eight years
to take care of the constantly en-
larging student body.

Reminiscing about the years past,
Doc recalls when the speaking and
conventional dress traditions were still
respected by the student body. He
remembers that the students looked
much better and acted accordingly:
he feels that a friendlier atmosphere
prevailed when the speaking tradi-
tion was intact and is especially sorry
of its passing. Doc also recalls that,
when they were students at W&L,
Robert Huntley, the next president
of Washington and Lee, and Roger
Mudd, CBS news commentator, used
to sit around drinking beer in the
Corner Grill.

Doc has enjoyed his tenure in Lex-
ington very much and feels that above
all, it has kept him young. Both he
and Mrs. Doc are saddened by their
retirement, but realize that the new

 

 

 

owners, R. J. Carter and C. H. Mull,
will carry on the great tradition of
the Corner Grill.

Carter and Mull, both former state
police officers, have already taken
over the business and can be ob-
served daily behind the front counter.
Mr. Carter explained that he enjoys
the restaurant business and likes
especially the public and the students,

The new proprietors plan to re-
Open the taproom for patronage to
the public on Friday and Saturday
nights from 5:00 until 11:00 p.m;
from Monday through Thursday
nights it will be available for private
dinners and parties,

The Lyric Cinema has also taken |
R/C |

on new ownership, with the
Company buying out Ed Side and
with John “Mike” Hession replac-
ing him as manager. Mike has com-
pletely remodeled the interior of the
theater and has completely destroyed
all claims that it may have to being
“The Pit;” new carpeting, seat covers,
and wall paper have ultimately chang-
ed the appearance into a beautiful and
clean movie theater,

Mike plans to continue Side’s policy
of showing only art films, but points
out that today only a thing line exists
between art and commercial flicks.
Moreover, he plans to show once
every month an adult film. Two such
films which will appear next Friday
are “Hot Skin and Cold Cash” and
“Good Time With A Bad Girl.” “Hot
Skin” is the bizarre story of “the
stark reality of the private life of a
prostitute,” who claims that what her
husband doesn't know, won't hurt
him. “Good Time” is a flick which,
as Hession said, doesn’t leave much
to the imagination. Saying the least,
the new Lyric Theater will indeed |
not only uphold, but will probably |
surpass the standards of movie show- |
ing intiated by our beloved and great |
Professor Side.

Another new feature of the Lyric!
Cinema is its showing of relatively
recent pictures; among these up-com-
ing flicks will be a series of Shake-
spearian classics,

 

 

 

 

 

Peale’s Lafayette on display in Washington gallery

W&L lends Smithsonian famous portrait

By MACK WOODWARD

One of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity's most prized pieces of art,
Charles Wilson Peale's portrait of
the Marquis de Lafayette, has been
loaned to the Smithsonian Institution
in Washington, D.C.

The portrait will be on display
when the Smithsonian unveils its new
national museum of art, the National
Portrait Gallery, this fall in the na-
tion's capital,

The portrait shows Lafayette in
the uniform of the Continental Army

| when he fought with George Wash-

 

ingion for America’s independence.
Washington himself commissioned
Peale to paint the portrait and it
was delivered to Washington in 1781

The portrait, along with many
others, passed through inheritance
from the Washington to the Lee
family, and through the latter came
into the University’s possession. In
this way also the University acquired
its more famous Peale portrait, that
of Washington in his Virginia mili-
tary uniform, now displayed in Lee
Chapel on the campus

Also included in the Lee Collection,
which passed into the University's
hands are the James Sharples portrait
of G. W. P, Custis, Van Dyke's por-
traits of the Custis Ancestor Wife
and the Custis Ancesior Man, and
John Wollaston’s portraits of Martha

Washington, Daniel Parke Custis, and |
| ton dating to 1836

John Parke and Martha Custis

 

The Lee Collection also includes
many portraits of which the author's
identity has remained obscure. These
include Miss Custis, Frances Parke
Custis, Elizabeth Parke Custis, John
Custis Hl, William Henry Fitzhugh
of Chatham, and William Henry Fitz-
hugh of Ravensworth.

The portrait of General Lafayette,
when at Washington and Lee hangs
in the west wall of the lobby of
McCormick Library. Also hanging in
the library are the Gilbert Stuart
portrait of George Washington and
G.P.A, Healey porirait, copied from
the Stuart, of Thomas Jefferson.

The Peale Lafayette will be one
of four by the artist among the ap-
proximately three hundred works on
display where the National Portrait
Gallery opens to the public October

It was the feeling of eight out of ten
members of the E. C. that the dress
of freshmen in the dining hall had
suffered a gradual decay down to the
point where some freshmen were
wearing shorts and sweatshirts to the
meals, and that something had to be
done to curb the decline.

In lieu of the situation the E.C.
has adopted the policy that conven-—
tional dress will be required of fresh- |
men in the dining hall. It will be
the duty of the Dormitory Counselors
to deal with offenders and if neces-
sary report repeated violators to the
Student Control Committee. The
members of the E.C. certainly hope
that such action will not be necessary,
but feel that if conventional dress
can be encouraged in the dining hall,
the mode will be set for all campus
activities,

Of course, we expect some criticism
in the whole idea of “enforced tradi-
tions” but let me say frankly that
W&L men who are genuinely interst-
ed in seeing the coat and tie tradi-
tion preserved at Washington and Lee,
men who feel that this tradition is
a worthy one which shows pride not
only in one’s school, but in oneself.
who feel that this tradition sets an
atmosphere of gentlemanly conduct in
all activities, which is our goal, these
men will do all that they can to
encourage conventional dress among
their friends and fellow students.

If we had more of these men on
the campus such action by the E.C.
would not be necessary. Hopefully the
Class of 1972 will have such men and
the critics will have nothing to com-
plain about,

In an entirely separate area, the
new E.C. voted unanimously to sup
port the plea of every returning mem-
ber of the Cold Check Committee to
expand its jurisdiction into the area
of overdue accounts. In this capacity,
the committee will not act as a col
lecting agency, but rather only as an
investigating body

Washington and Lee's football

team opened its 1968 season on

Saturday before a somewhat less than
enthusiastic crowd at Wilson Field,
The results of this year were practic-
ally the same as last year despite
some fine individual performances.
Although the score showed 28-0, the
defense played a fine game and the
offense appeared substantially better
than last year.

The big difference in the game was
the superb Guilford defense which
kept W&L pinned back deep in its
own territory for most of the game.
Led by freshman Tommy Peguese
with two interceptions, the Quakers’
defense set up three of the four Guil-
ford touchdowns and just missed
getting another when the final gun
sounded.

The Generals dominated the initial
stages of play. The offense led by
Alan Tomlin, began a 14 play drive
that went all the way to the Guilford
4. Mixing his plays beautifully, he
sent Crosland around the ends on
sweeps for consistent big yardage. In
several close yardage situations, Dick
Kinney was called upon to deliver.
As the workhorse of the backfield,
Kinney not only picked up the one
yard, but three or four as well, in-
cluding one fourth down effort. On
two occasions, Tomlin ran for good
yardage on pass option rollouts, But
the offense sputtered on the Guilford
4 with three incomplete passes.
Rather than attempt the field goal, the
Generals tried to pass for the touch-
down on fourth down, but were un-
successful.

Guilford couldn't move the ball,
though, and was forced to punt. From
here on the Quaker offense started
working, and punt exchanges gradu-
ally worked the Generals deep into
their owne territory. Late in the half,
with the ball on their own three, the
Generals fumbled. The Guilford of-
fense took over, and with 4:52 left in
the period, Larry Funkhouser drove
over for the score.

Following the successful extra
point, it all happened again. Luke
Crosland taking the ball on a sweep,
was hit hard. The ball squirted out
of his hands, and Guilford guard
Ed Allen fell on it on the W&L 19.
Even worse for the Generals was that
Crosland injured his leg on the play
and had to be carried off the field.
Almost vengefully, the Guilford quart-
erback, Ray Tavalaro, was racked up
on the next play and he never re-
appeared. This didn't stop the Quak-
er’s momentum, however, as the re-
placement, Mike Bobbuzzi, swept
around left end for the score at 2:34.

With a rather poor kickoff return,
the Generals took possession on their
23. Hard pressure on Tomlin drove
the Blue all the way back to their

9, and once again they had to kick.
A good runback gave Guilford the
ball on the W&L 20. Within three
plays the Quakers scored again. With
0:18 left to go, the point was good
and W&L trailed at the half 21-0.

The game died in the second half.
The Generlas came out with a new
The Generals came out with a new
offense. Chuck Kuhn took over the
quarterbacking, and Joe Dozier and
Doug Gossman were the running
backs.

Only once did the Generals mount
an offensive in the third quarter. With
the Blue threatening on the Guilford
29, Tommy Peguese picked off a pass
and brought it back to his 47. A long
pass to Mike Hunt took the Quakers
to the W&L 2. But the Generals,
putting up a fierce resistence on the
next play forced a fumble and stopped
them for the moment. Once more
the Generals were unable to move
the ball. A punt gave Guilford the
ball on the W&L 45. On third and
ten, Bobby Spain took in a bomb in
the Generals’ end zone. With the point
good, the score stood: Guilford 28,
WAL 0. At 1:23 in the game, the
Generals were given one last chance
to score when quarterback Bob Cross
of Guilford fumbled on his 18. Once
again, however, Tommy Peguese in-
tercepted a Jack Baizley pass on his
4. He ran it back to the W&L 26 and
the clock ran out,

The big problem the team faced
was an inability to keep momentum
going after the initial touchdown

 

failure in the first quarter. After that

 

the Generals failed to mount any kind
of offensive at all. The line faced
difficulties in opening holes, and this
problem became worse as the game
wore on.

The Generals offense also suffered }-

in that it’s passing game was not
used with nearly the potency of last
year. Last year with Andy Bloom
at quarterback, Bucky Cunningham
became the darling of Wilson Field
fans. Alan Tomlin is certainly the
equal of Bloom at quarterback, and
yet, his passing talents and the great
talents of Cunningham weren't used
until late in the third quarter when
the game was out of reach,

On the defensive side there isn’t
much to say. The defense played a
fine game which the final score belies.
Three of the four times in which
the Quakers scored they got the ball
inside the Generals 40 yard line.
The defensive backfield also failed at
a few critical moments, It must be
realized that this was the first game
of the season, the team has only
been practicing for about two weeks,
a new head coach had to step into
a difficult situation, and the Quakers
turned out to be an extremely good
team.

Next week the Blue faces the
Randolph-Macon Yellowjackets away.
In last year’s game the Generals
staved off a fourth quarter rally by
RMC to win a 13-12 game. This is
a crucial game in the battle for the
state small college championship and
it should be watched closely.

W&L students too cool for football

By ROY CARLTON
Sports Editor

For the second consecutive year
Guilford mauled Washington and
Lee. In all fairness to the Generals,
it must be said that they put up a
hard fight: spirits were high, and the
boys were out to win; the offense |
showed that the first time they had |
the ball.

But how long can a team maintain
high spirits when the home field ad-|
vantage is working against it? The
Guilford crowd, though small, was)
certainly vocal. The Guilford cheer- |
leaders completely drowned out the
one or two visiting W&L partisians.
Ihe Generals played at Guilford last
year, why did they have to go through
all that again this year? They didn't
have to, but they did. And the game
was played on Wilson Field.

The problem wasn't that there
weren't any W&L students at the
game. True, attendance wasn't extra-

ordinary, but it wasn't terrible either.
The amazing thing is that they never
cheered or applauded or did any-
thing, except for a little while in the
first quarter. Or maybe it isn't so

It has become almost a tradition
at this school for the student never
to cheer. He must keep his cool and
blend into the stadium. Whether the
game is close or not, he leaves after
the first quarter. Its a lot more en-

 

 

 

 

 

 

joyable to sit with your date in the

| fraternity house and watch the game

on the tube.

How come nobody told the folks
from Guilford that? They came about
forty strong, excluding ten cheerlead-
ers, and made more noise than you'll
ever hear on Wilson Field. They
stayed until the end of the game, too.

This game wasn't the only one
where the visitors have brought with
them the home field advantage. Dur-
ing the last basketball season, W&L
had a home basketball game with
Bridgewater. There couldn't have been
more than three hundred W&L stu-
dents in Doremus, yet the Gym was
packed. Whenever time was called,
the Bridgewater cheerleaders would
run on to the court and start shaking
rafters. Numerous other instances |
could be cited, but they're unneces-|
sary.

There was a high school marching
band at Saturday's game (why W&L
doesn't have some kind of band is a
mystery). Several times toward the
end of the game they'd start a cheer. |
At last, recovered fumble gave |
WAL the ball on the Guilford 26.
The band members started screaming

 

“We want a touchdown.” The Guil-|
ford fans sat deathly silent. So did/|
the WAL fans. There couldn't have |
been more than two students cheering
along with the high school kids, |
Maybe it's because they wore white
socks,

It isn’t really that there isn’t any)
spirit at this school, there's a lot of
it. It shows up whenever Wahoos are
trying to snake a WAL date. Students
at this school are proud of it, They
smugly reflect that it's the best school
in Virginia, It doesn't need support,
it's clearly superior, That's why Guil-
ford won

Belmont-Abbey beats booters despite rally

Disspirited play by the home team
and a fine effort by Belmont-Abbey
forward Bob Schambach contributed
to W&L’s first soccer loss of the
season, 4-3. The Generals entered the
game as the favorite with bright hopes
for the season, but a dogged B-A
attack kept the Generals on the de-
fensive for most of the game.

The Generals couldn't seem to get
started until late in the game. They
seem to be, as in the past, a pres-
sure team which responds well to
important games and clutch  situa-
tions, but which starts slowly when
favored. Oveconfidence took its toll
yesterday, despite a strong rally in
the second half.

The Blue were clearly the superior
team with better team play and ex-
cellent ball control, but the determin-
ed team from Belmont-Abbey con-
tinually managed to break things up.
Schambach scored midway through
the first period with an assist by
Jack Murphy. B-A_ goalie Mike

Keeney played well, stopping early |

shots by W&L aces John Yow and
Scott Fechnay.

In the sceond period, Schambach
scored his second goal with an assist
from Pat Cunningham. The Generals
were completely frustrated, as the
B-A defense held fast against any
scoring attempts.

 

With the coming of the third quart: |

er. the Generals were a new team,
determined to erase the Crusaders’
2-0 lead. A fierce attack netted two
quick goals for the Blue, both by
All-America candidate Fechnay. Early
in the quarter, Fechnay fired in a
shot on a beautiful feed by Curt
Jamison. Moments later, B-A was
penalized for illegal use of hands, and
Fechnay was awarded a free shot
With perfect reliability, Fechnay

kicked the shot through the Belmont-
Abbey wall and into the net to tie
the game.

However, there was still plenty of
fight left in the Crusaders and Bobby
Schambach scored again on an assist
from Cunningham to make the score
3-2 before the end of the quarter.

Almost with the beginning of the
final quarter, Dick Ivey drilled in a
shot on an assist from Scott Fechnay
to tie the score once more. The Gen-
erals were not about to settle for a

to beat, but if they receive as small
a number of spectators as they did
in the Belmont-Abbey game, then they
will assuredly lose any initiative to
win. The spirit of the few B-A sup-
porters and of the boys on the bench
was indeed impressive and far above
the meager attempt at enthusiasm
made by the W&L fans. If the Gen-
erals are going to put forth the
athletic effort, then the least that the
fans can do is to give them their
well-deserved support.

To make any system of rush work,
it is vital that the fraternities adhere
to the rules established by the IFC—
particularly in regard to “dirty rush,”
which if anything probably increased
this year. Rather than reduce this
problem, the new rush which spans
14 to 16 weeks increases the op-
portunity for “dirty rush.” Only by

If it is too idealistic to think of
a rush system at W&L that excludes
slandering of one another's houses
then this article is obviously wasted.
If, however, it is possible that such
a system could exist here, then now
is the time for fraternities to begin
working for such a system before the
present methods of rush cause the
demise of the fraternity system from
