Deferred Rush

The Faculty Executive Committee
yesterday recommended that the fac-
ulty as a whole in its meeting Mon-
day approved on a three-year trial
basis a deferred rush plan calling for
the end of rush and pledging just
before Thansgiving.

The plan, presented to the com-
mittee by Student Body Vice-Presi-
dent Danny Leonard, was drafted by
Mike Hosford and Dave Stovall, was |
presented to the Interfraternity Coun-
cil Monday, October 21, and appear-
ed in Ring-tum Phi the next day.

 

It calls for a series of open houses, |
in which the freshmen may visit the |
houses in the evening after the start |
of classes, Although rush would form-
ally end near mid-semester, no pledg- |
ing activities could be scheduled un- |

til after the start of the second
semester.
The plan as originally presented

to the IFC called for rush ending at |
the beginning of the second semester,
but it was offered to the faculty in
its present form folowing a Tuesday |
Ring-tum Phi editorial asking for mid- |
semester deferred rush.

According to Dean William J.
Walt, neither this plan, nor another
one to be considered by the faculty

Monday, incorporate “no contact”
rules.
The other plan to be considered

is one which calls for a semester-long
rush, the method of open houses or
“smokers” to be employed in_ this
case also.

The action of the Faculty Executive

Committee followed a similar en-
dorsement by the Student Affairs
Committee, another faculty group,

and repeated actions by the IFC de-
siring a reconsideration of the resolu-
tion passed last year which called
for rush after the first semester of
the freshman year.

Since freshmen would be allowed
social use of the fraternities for
combo weekends during the rush
period, the plan also incorporates a
social fee in addition to the rush

fee each rushee now pays.

 

PLAYING A SCENE from the current Troub production, lonesco’s “Exit the King,” are Mrs. Betty Kahn, wife of
the Troubs’ director, and Pat Bernarezyk, a freshman at W&L. The play will run tonight and tomorrow night, with

curtain both times at 8:30 p.m.

fall in the annual giving category.

The Lee Associates was establish

Toward Better Concerts

Although it is not our intention at this time to criticize
the operations of the Dance Board, we feel there are certain
things this group could have done and can do in the future
to make concerts more enjoyable.

Last weekend’s ““$100-a-minute” concert featuring the Four
Tops certainly was not worth the money paid to have this
big-name group. Unless one happened to be sitting on the
sides of the stage, he could not hear anything over the loud
speakers. Those sitting in the center aisles could only see
mouths moving but could not be sure voices were being
emitted. Even when voices were heard, they were garbled and
scratchy.

This is no new problem. For every event held in Doremus
Gymnasium there is something wrong with the sound equip-
ment. There is no reason to spend so much money on a group
when they cannot be heard clearly. We might just as well play
their records if we do not rent or buy new sound equipment.

One thing that irks us to no end is the spotlight. The per-
son who works the spotlight feels as if the light must keep
time with the music. He keeps changing the colors of the light
so that sometimes the stage is completely dark. This is dis-
tracting to the audience as well as to the performers.

Whenever there is a big-name group playing at a W&L
concert, we feel the Dance Board should try to have it in a
larger place than Doremus Gym. For example, the VMI field-
house might be used. This would allow more people without
dance plans to come to the concerts and help defray some of
the expenses.

We ask the Dance Board to keep these suggestions in mind.
The equipment and atmosphere must keep in step with the
rising quality of entertainment W&L demands.

Verbal Convictions

(Reprinted from Hollins Columns, October 8, 1968)

Last spring, Hollins students were outraged over discti-
minatory practices of approved hostesses in Charlottesville,
Blacksburg, Lexington and Natural Bridge. We protested,
abhorring injustice and prejudice. The ruling was changed,
allowing a wider choice of accomodations.

Yet the position of the hostesses remains unchallenged. Too
many Hollins students continue to patronize those hostesses
who specify “no colored.” The forms on file in the Student
Activities office show clearly which houses are not open to all
Hollins students. To choose to stay in one of these homes is
hypocrisy.

It is time to carefully consider the strength of our verbal
convictions.

Acknowledgement Of Source

We regret that we failed to acknowledge the source of
last week’s lead editorial entitled, “Choose A Candidate—If
You Can.” The editorial was reprinted in a shortened and
substantially unchanged form from the editorial, titled

“Choose If You Can,” of the October 19, 1968 issue of The
New Republic.

This is not our usual practice and certainly was not done
consciously. We do not condone this and shall strive to be
more careful in the future.

CONTACT To Study ‘Power’

By PAT AREY

CONTACT for 1969 will center
around the faces of power, accord-
ing to Chairman Sam Hinkle. This
year’s CONTACT subject will be
“power, its uses and abuses, implica-
tions and attainment,” said Hinkle.

CONTACT is an intellectual and
public affairs symposium sponsored
by the Interfraternity Council and stu-
dent body. This year it will be held
the second week in February.

Speakers have been invited to talk
on black power, student power,
foreign policy and the American in-
volvement abroad. Other topics will
include the power of many over his
environment and its philospohical im-
plications, and the role of the artist/
intellectual within the power complex,

CONTACT was first initiated in
the spring of 1965 under the auspices
of the IFC. The topic was “The
American Experience and Its Impli-
cations.” Speakers included New York
Times Washington Bureau chief Tom
Wicker and presidential assistant
Douglass Cater. Cater is the author
of a book on the influence of news
reporting on the conduct of govern-
ment affairs, The Fourth Branch of
Government.

The CONTACT Program for 1966
centered on the problem of the
American city. Author and social
critic Michael Harrington was one of
the major speakers. He is the author
of “The Other America” and “The
Accidental Century.”

Following Harrington, CONTACT
featured conservative columnist and
urbanologists Ernst Van Den Haag
and Claude Brown, author of “Man-
child in the Promised Land,” a book
on Brown's experiences as a child in
the ghettos of New York.

Most Popular Speaker

One of the most popular speakers

/to come to the WAL campus under
| CONTACT

sponsorship was Tom
Wolfe. Wolfe, a WAL graduate, is
the author of “The Kandy Kolored
Tangerine Flake Streamlined Baby”
and more recently two works, one en-
titled “The Pump House Gang.”
The 1967 CONTACT topic was
“The Crumbling Establishment.” It
featured former CORE director James

Conservative spokesman Frederick
Wilhelmsen gave his view on_ the
American “establishment.”

CONTACT 1968 centered around
the upcoming W&L Mock Republican
Convention. The topic was “What's
New Pachyderm?”

The first speaker was Kentucky
Senator Thurston Morton. Morton
spoke on the policies of the Republi-
can party.

Barry Goldwater was the major
speaker of the program. He spoke
to a capacity crowd in Evans Dining
Hall on Friday night. Goldwater was
the Republican candidate for Presi-
dent in 1964, and is currently run-
ning for the U. S. Senate in Arizona.

Other speakers include former
Presidential assistant Stephen Hess.
Hess was co-author of “The Republi-

 

 

can Establishment” along with Wash-
ington Post political reporter David
Broader,

The program was rounded out with
former Maryland Governor Theodore
McKeldin, who nominated Dwight
Eisenhower at the 1952 Republican
National Convention; political
columnist Robert Novak and pollster
Samuel Lubell.

The 1969 CONTACT Steering
Committee was selected last spring.
Named chairman was Sam Hinkle, a
senior from Shelbyville, Ky. The vice-
chairman is Mike Nation, a senior
from Knightstown, Ind. Other mem-
bers are Mark Faverman, Ned Powell,
Ken Long, Jeff Wexler, Dave Field,
Danny Leonard, Dave Hardee,
Michael “Thunder” Thornton, and
Patrick Arey.

 

 

 

The Youngest Delegate

By FRANK ROSE

A large part of the enraptured read- |
ers of the latest issue of The South-
ern Conservative were doubtless sur-
prised to find that the lead article |
was a feature about the participation |
in the 1968 Democratic National Con- |
vention of a freshman at Washington |
and Lee.

That freshman was Steve Dugan of |
Fort Valley, Georgia. The article, |
written by Dugan himself, describes |
his experiences as a voting delegate
on the Georgia delegation at Chicago
this past August.

One of the more interesting parts
of Dugan's story was that in which |
he said, “I had been thrust into an
influential position. I represented over |
60,000 Georgians.”

year old Miss Degermark, in her first
film, is a beautifully human (rather
than innocent or naive) Elvira, while
veteran Berggren is more fatalistic
in his best performance to date. The
rich faces of the minor characters,
and indeer the exquisite natural colors
of Scandinavia, are so wonderfully
captured by the photography that it
would seem that Degas has been ani-
mated,

The most frequent, though super
ficial, criticism of Elvira Madigan is
that in attempting to be artful it
violates the rigid formula that must
be followed if a picture is to be a

success; that this film is

 

simply a series of exquisitely compos
ed shots spliced together in an order
that imitates the structure of a plot
Such 4 criticism assumes an idyllic
style and pace, and might even de
termine Elvira and Sixten to be stupid

Hendricks Stand Attacked

Dear Editor:

In Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi, Pete
Hendricks rationalized away the prin-
ciple of human dignity for Black
people by arguing that we do not
need to apply it to the issue of hous-
ing Black dates in Lexington.

Thus, his article concerning the EC
policy is a statement of white racism,

FCA Will Not Be Used

Editor, the Friday Ring-tum Phi:

I wish to make clear the fact that
the following people are not presently
nor ever have been members of the
Fellowship of Christian Athletes as
was falsely stated in their lists of
activities for the “Who's Who” (Oct,
25, Ring-tum Phi): Rob O, Bauer,
Jr, John F, Carrere, Jr., Luke B.
Crosland, Sam D. Hinkle, 1V, Judson
H. Simmons, Charles E. Stuart. We
take pride in the F.C.A. and it will not
be allowed to be thougnt of as just
another club to be placed in a quali-
fication list.

Thank you,
Philip Douglass
President, F.C.A,

A Look At Spiro

Dear Sirs:

Tuesday night I traveled to Staun-
ton with a group of Washington and
Lee Young Republicans to hear Re-
publican Vice-Presidential candidate
Spiro T. Agnew speak. I am a liberal

but I was interested in what Mr,
Agnew had to say.
Admittedly Mr. Agnew’s speech

was, in the first place, political. He
played to his audience in quest of
their support (which he probably al-
ready had anyway). Even so one could
detect his feeling on the issues and
his candidacy from his speech.

The most vivid impression I got
from his remarks was his constant
reference to what he termed the
“quiet Americans.” This is the large
number of middle-class Americans
whom Agnew and Nixon feel are the
victims of today’s domestic and
foreign problems. He and Nixon have
made it clear that they plan to, and
expect to receive the overwhelming
majority of the middle-class vote. At
this point in the campaign _ this
strategy is proving very successful.
As | looked around the audience
on Tuesday night what | saw were
mostly middle-class whites. | didn’t
see any but I was told that there
were only five Negroes in an audience
that must have numbered at least
three thousand, This indicates to me
something about the campaign of
Nixon and Agnew. They are ignor-
ing the black man, the poor man,
and the young person in their quest
for the highest offices in the land.
How they expect to govern effectively
without the support of these three
vital segments of the society is be-
yond me,

Agnew also addressed himself to
the talk of balancing the budget. This
he said would be one of the objectives

A Statement Of Policy

By KR. BRANDON WILDES

|

Some weeks ago I released my first |
“biting satire” (thanks Erome!), pri- —

marily directed at the present Phys|
Fd program, which produced the re-|
sults that I had been hoping for. |
They came in the form of a biting

; Febuttal in the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi, |
| Which proves someone reads the Fri-|

day Phi, while rebuking everything 1)
said, agreed with me entirely, (I|
didn't make much sense to me either |
One thing they might have done was
to defend the coaching staff, (Per-
sonally | think they're a darn fine
group of guys, just misdirected.) How-

ever
I think that a statement of pur
pose amd policy is indicated, Wash

ingion and Lee is not living up to its
full potential. The fact remains, and
regatdiess of what it may be at
tributed to, that we are losing 15
points on median college board scores
annually, (1 suppose | should now
expect a letter from Dean Farrar)
Perhaps the population ix decreasing,
however, there still intelligent
students somewhere, and we are not
attracting them. Fifteen poinis would
seem quile alarming

ourselves in the myth that our school

riculum is often better than ten years
behind that of other such institutions
of higher learning, according for this
with some misfounded idea of wait:
ing for perfection. One of our pri
mary comforts is the fact that we
remain the biggest studs in the
vicinity, (1 suspect that I'll be getting
around to that in the future.)

As long as these deficiences remain,

Menu For Tomorrow’s Game--Tiger Meat

 

Baby Generals
Kick AMA, 39-0

Although Bridgewater became the
first victims of the varsity footbal
team last Saturday, it was not the
first victory by a football team this
year, For the day before, the fresh-
man football team encountering
August Military Academy were able
to claim that distinction, And _ their
victory was a very convincing 39-0
thrashing of A.M.A,

What made the game so much
more astounding was that the baby
Generals were using an offense in-
stalled only two days before—the
single wing. The key to a good single
wing attack is the tailback, and Jo-Jo
Martin proved that to A.M.A. Jo-Jo
moved the baby Generals at will and,
except for some dropped passes and
mistakes near A.M.A.’s goal line,
the score could have been even
greater. In moving the baby Gen-
erals, Jo-Jo managed to find time
to throw a touchdown pass while scor-
ing three times himself,

he first period was scoreless, but

| in the second period W&L broke the
| game
|came with 8:41 left in the half on a

wide open. ‘The first score
Martin pass to Dan Armstrong from
38 yards out. Martin kicked the
extra point. Then Bobby LaRue re-
covered an A.M.A. fumble on their
four yard line and Martin scored
from the two with 7:47 left in the
half. The kick failed. Then with 3:58
remaining in the half Martin scored
from the 15 yard line but the kick
again was no good. This touchdown
had been set up by Glenn Torger-
son's 25 yard punt return to the
A.M.A. 25 and then an interference
penalty against A.M.A, at the fifteen.

Seventeen second later, Dave Har-
bert picked off an A.M.A. pass and
returned it 42 yards for a_touch-
down to make the score 25-0. With
just 57 seconds left in the half, Torg-
erson scored the baby Generals’ fifth
touchdown of the quarter on a two-
yard run, This had been set up by a
Martin to Armstrong pass good for
30 yards to the 2. The score at the
half was 31-0.

The second half scored only one
touchdown, that on a 32 yard run
by Martin with 3:55 left in the game.
Duncan Pace caught a two point con-
version pass to end the scoring for
the day with WAL winning 39-0.

Certainly the bady Generals look-
ed impressive both offensively and
defensively last Friday and they will
have a chance to end their season
at the .S00 level by beating Green-
briar Military Academy next Friday.
That may be a large task, however,
as Greenbriar pasted the same A.M.A.
team 77-0. In any case it looks to be
a high-scoring battle.

Hunting Season To Begin

The general hunting season for
turkeys and small game opens in
Rockbridge County Monday and indi-
cations point to a fairly plentiful
supply of game.

The bear hunters will be able to

itake to the woods a week later, on
i

 

Nov. 11, and the two-week deer sea-
ison opens a week after that, on
Nov. 18.

The only big change in the hunt-
ing regulations for Rockbridge this
year is the change of the hunters’
choice day, when bucks or does can
be shot, from the first day of the
season to the last day. This will
apply in counties west of the Blue

Ridge, according to counly game
warden Don Wirt.
One area which is popular with

local hunters, the Gathright Wildlife
Management Area in Bath and Al
jleghany counties, will not be open
for fall turkey hunting this year.

The small game and squirrel sea
son will be open here from Nov, 4

through Jan. 31: the turkey season
from Nov, 4 to Dec. 17; the bear
season from Nov. 11 to Dec. 21

and the deer season from Nov, 18

to Nov. 30.

Washington and Lee football co-captain John Wolf calls

- = 7
it ‘‘a real juicer.’

Interpretation: the Generals won’t have any trouble getting
“juiced up” for Saturday’s home game with their chief rivals,

Sewanee’s Purple Tigers.

A definite rivalry has developed between the two schools.
“Each tries to be superior academically and in athletics too,”

Wolf said. “Playing Sewanee is an*—-——

automatic incentive.”

It’s a rivalry the coaches have en-
couraged. “Sewanee has had such
outstanding teams, we've sold our
kids on the challenge of beating
them,” said W&L head coach Buck
Leslie. “But the boys have largely
done it themselves.”

“It's the type of football they play,”
added Wolf. “It’s real ‘come at you’
football.”

the Generals’ leading ground-gainer
with 429, He is averaging 4.4 yards
a carry.

An unsung General hero is sopho-
more fullback Doug  Gossman,
another Louisvillian whose excellent
blocking sprung Kuhn loose on many
of his long runs. It was Gossman
who threw the key block on Dozier’s
39-yard touchdown run on W&L’s
first play from scrimmage.

The visiting Tigers will “come at” | —

Wolf and his Generals beginning at
2:30 p.m. tomorrow on Wilson Field.
It’s Parents’ Weekend at W&L, and
1,200 visiting parents and guests will
be among those on hand.

The game is also an important
conference contest. Both Washington
and Lee (0-1 in the league) and
Sewanee (1-1) have long-shot chance
of tieing front-runner Centre (3-1)
for the College Athletic Conference
championship. Centre has completed
its conference schedule.

Sewanee’s single-wing offense will
pose some problems for the Generals,
It features a pair of hard-running
tailbacks, Jim Beene and Bill Blount,
and fullback Nathaniel (Bubba)
Owens, whom the Generals remember
well from last year when he gained
144 yards in a 43-0 Sewanee rout.

WAL will counter with its offense
centered around scrambling quarter-
back Chuck Kuhn. The Louisville,

Ky. junior accounted for 130 yards, |

scored one touchdown and threw for
two more as W&L won its first game
last Saturday, 27-13, over Bridge-
water.

yards against Bridgewater and is now

of a Nixon Administration, Nixon
and Agnew are also “hawks” and
would be sure to continue to sup-
port our position in Vietnam. It will
be a miracle if the Nixon administra-
tion could balance a budget that re-
quires the cost of a war and the
cost of tremendous domestic needs.
Mr. Agnew claimed that domestic
needs could be statisfied “fueling the
powerful engines of free enterprise,”
yet he neglected to mention the money
that it would cost, Also it is entirely
questionable whether or not free)
enterprise (the quasi-god of the Re-
publican party) could be trusted, In
my own home town free enterprise
has ruined the investments of count-
less homeowners through corrupt
zoning practices. Who’s to say that
free enterprise would not look for
every opportunity to build their bank
accounts at the exepnse of the gov-

terprise has the money but not the
integrity to handle the elimination of |
the ghetto.

Mr. Agnew also addressed himself |
to the question of academic freedom. |
He stated that someone like Eldridge
Cleaver should not be allowed to!
lecture in an American university (as
he did at Berkley). When one starts |
to delude himself that academic free-
dom is the exclusion of the likes of |
Eldridge Cleaver he is clearly wrong. |
Academic freedom is a matter of in-|
clusion not exclusion, where everyone |
who should be heard is heard. When
everyone is heard then each will |
make his decision accordingly, with
the understanding of all points of
view. This is academic freedom.

In quoting the president of the
American Bar association Mr. Agnew

that “riots are a negetion of justice.”
One gathered from his statements that
he felt this is the only cause of riots.
If he does, he certainly does not de-
serve to be vice-president. A negation
of justice may be the initial spark to
a riot but the true causes lie in the
deplorable conditions in the ghetto.
One should attack the cause of a
riot, the horrible conditions in the
ghetto, not the result—lawlessness, if
riots are to be eliminated. Again
Mr. Agnew fails to grasp an issue
as it exists in America today.

Who then should one vote for
Nixon is definitely out of the picture
because he and Agnew agree on the
above mentioned issues, and in my
opinion they are both misdirecting
their remedies for America’s prob-
lems, while disregarding the poor
and the black. Unhappily after listen-
ing to Spiro T. Agnew speak Tuesday
night | have come to the conclusion
that the only logical choice for Presi-
dent and Vice-President is Hubert
Humphrey and Edmond Muskie.
Neither are very attractive candidates
but four years of complete disregard
of for the dissaffected members of
American society is totally incompre-
hensible.

‘Elvira,’ A Filmed Dream

(Continued from Page 2)
What the film’s detractors fail to
realize is the Elvira Madigan is
penetrating a new realm: one reviewer
described it as “an exploration of
state of being and feeling’; | choose
to call it a filmed dream.

It is to Widenberg’s credit that, in
creating this dream state, he exercises
remarkable restraint in sustaining the
action; rather than impress us with an
ingenious display of flashbacks or at-
tempt to keep our interest by insert-
ing several semi-climactic bedroom
scenes (which recently have become
all but obligatory in the “adult”
movie), he skillfully blends visual and
aural elements into a rhythmic style
that encourages the spectator to cast
off his consciousness of watching a
movie. For this reason much of the
film is silent in style; all is not re-
vealed, we must piece together the
psychology of the lovers in our own
minds,

Having established the “level of
reality” in which he wishes to operate,
Widerberg slowly tightens the action;
each suceeding scene seems to be
more heavly melancholic in anticipa-
tion of the lover's inevitable doom.
Suspense is generated when the plot
fades into reality just as we are
getting accustomed to the dream
world. When the bubble bursts there
is only a feeling of mild bursts there
tragic moment, however, is imbedded
in the mind, to be recalled shortly
afterwards.

The Youngest Delegate

(Continued from Page 2)

it became increasingly evident that
the Maddox delegation would be un-
seated in favor of the one led by
state Representative Julian Bond.
Dugan reports that when the regular |
delegation walked out rather than
share its votes with the one led by
Bond, “We felt like the Democratic
Party had left Georgia.” As he re-
flects in the Southern Conservative,
“Paced with the choice between being
a Democrat and being a self-respect-
ing individual, I chose the latter.”

Lynchburg College Plan
Questioned By Nation

(Continued from Page 2)

the plan which need to be considered.

The most obvious effect of the
Lynchburg plan is that it demands
less time be spent on campus. Is this
desirable on a campus where the aca-
demic-social dichotomy is of such a
strained nature that the faculty has
requested the fraternities to delay rush
so that a freshman may be academic-
ally oriented at the outset rather than
socliarly? Rather, a new scheduling
system should encourage more time
be spent on campus to foster an aca-
demic orientation and that campus
cohesivness W&L claims for itself.

All of this points to an alternative | |
system that includes afternoon classes. | §
Offerings could be spread out over) ©

a great many meeting times with

considerable ease and flexiblity. Stu-| >

dents would be encouraged to spend
more time on campus. Breaks be-
tween classes could be lengthened
and/or students and instructors could
be without consecutive classes.

The Lynchburg plan contains none
of this. These issues have not been |
raised, Simplicity seems a hollow |
criterion for a schedule plan on a
small campus of sophisticated and in-
telligent students, especially when it
appears to be the only criterion. (To
go further, why does the block system
have to be preserved in any form?
The surrounding female institutions
get along without it quite admirably.)

 

Licensed Hostesses

the Interfraternity Council of Wash-
