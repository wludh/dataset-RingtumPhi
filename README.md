# Ring-tum Phi Data Set

## Description

This dataset is derived from the Ring-Tum Phi, the student newspaper of Washington and Lee University. The first issue was published in 1897 and students continue to publish this newspaper today. We created this dataset using [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) to OCR the tifs of each page then combined the pages of each issue into one text file. The folders are organized by volume and the number of issues in each volume varies. Each folder includes the Volume Number and the Year(s) and and file names include the Volume number and the Date of the issue. We have also created a folder with Volume level text files that combine all of the issues in one volume into a single file. The file names for those files includes the Volume and the Year(s).  

We started adding content to this collection from our most recent issues and are working our way back through the collection as we prepare the data.

These files are intended for textual analysis and not as a stand-in for the scanned copies to be read cover to cover.  If you'd like to read the issues and see the photographs, please go to the [The Washington and Lee University Ring-tum Phi online collection](https://dspace.wlu.edu/handle/11021/34829) in the [Digital Archive](https://dspace.wlu.edu/).

## Date

The scanning and OCR process for this project began in 2010.  Parts of the collection were rescanned in 2015.  We OCRed the entire collection in 2021.  We are still add new content to this collection.
