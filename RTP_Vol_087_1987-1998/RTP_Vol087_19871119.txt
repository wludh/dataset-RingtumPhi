Changes in tax laws affect financial aid

 

By Marie Dunne
Co-editor

 

Recent changes in financial aid
laws and tax laws could cause some
students to give up their part-time
jobs.

Before the changes in the financial
aid laws were enacted by Congress
this year, students were routinely ex-
pected to contribute $1,000 of their
summer earnings toward their col-
lege costs.

These changes in the financial
assistance laws now require a stu-
dent to contribute 70 percent of his or
her entire yearly earnings, said John
DeCourcy, director of financial aid
for Washington and Lee University.

That means students who work
several jobs during the summer and
continue working part time through-
out the academic year will be con-

Michael Camden, 30, of Buena
Vista was sentenced to 120 days in
jail for assaulting a police officer and

wounding charge, against
Washington and Lee University stu-
dent Pete Petino, sent before a grand
jury, decided Judge Joseph E. Hess
yesterday during the trial in the Lex-
ington General District Court.

Both charges stem from events
that occurred at about 1:45 a.m on
Oct. 18 as Petino was leaving the Chi
Psi fraternity house at 5 Lee Ave.

Petino said that Camden and two
other men, Tommy Coleman, 27, and
Robert Ward, 28, both of Buena

By earning “too much’ money
through summer and part-time earn-
ings, students may lose eligibility to
receive a guaranteed student loan, or
GSL.

‘‘What’s the sense in working if you
will be penalized for it?’’ said
DeCourcy.

“Because [students] have been
working hard, they lose GSL eligibili-

Last year, the changes in financial
aid required that parents declare all
their assets in applying for guar-
anteed student loans. Previously,
parents declared only income.

been eligible for a GSL. If that same
student’s parents own their own

Vista, pushed by him and entered the
fraternity after he had told them to
leave because they did not belong at
the party. Two of the men, Camden
and Coleman, came back toward
him after a few moments, Petino
said, with knives.

Petino said that he told the men
that the fraternity was not the place
for such actions and as he turned
back to look at a friend, was punched
by Camden. A scuffle ensued during
which the pair fell on the floor. Petino
said he tried to keep the knife away
from his body but still suffered a cut
on his left index finger.

As the men were separated by par-
tygoers, police pulled up outside the
fraternity and the three accused
assailants fled. Petino said he then

ble, and the parents are expected to
mortgage their home to cover college
costs, said DeCourcy.

Additionally, changes in the laws
last year require students who
receive scholarships or grants that
cover expenses other than tuition and
books (such as room and board) to
pay taxes on those grants.

According to Gerard R. Esposito,
IRS District Director in Richmond,
“beginning this year only degree
candidates can exclude from tax
amounts received as a qualified
scholarship. A qualified scholarship
includes amounts used for tuition,
fees, books and supplies required for
courses. Other amounts such as those
received for room and board or
travel are no longer excludable.”’

One of this year’s changes in the
financial aid laws is that parents who
are enrolled in college at least half-
time (6 credit hours per semester)

are considered when deciding a fami-
ly’s need of federal assistance, said
DeCourcy.

Parents were not previously con-
sidered as needing assistance if they
were attending college.

For example, suppose a family is
judged as having $10,000 to spend on
college tuition. If one son or daughter
is the only member of the family at-
tending college, he or she will not
receive financial assistance, because
$10,000 is expected to cover all the
costs. If a parent of that family takes
six credits at a nearby community
college by attending night school or
weekend classes, there are two
members of the family attending col-
lege. The available $10,000 is cut in
half ($5,000 per person), and the stu-
dent becomes eligible for financial
aid.

“Obviously, [the law] is subject to
manipulation by parents going to

noticed that blood covered his hands,
and he was taken by Officer Mark
Ramos to Stonewall Jackson Hos-
pital. Petino said he did not need to
have any stitches for the cut.

Petino said he saw Camden at the
hospital, along with the two other
men from the fracas at the party.
Petino identified the men to Officer
Ramos, who placed the three under
arrest. Ramos said that he loosely
handcuffed Camden so as not to ir-
ritate Camden’s wounded hand.
Ramos said that Camden was being
verbally abusive, grew more and
more agitated and swung his hands
across Ramos’ temple.

Camden’s lawyer said that his
client only became abusive after he
asked to have the handcuffs loosened

and they were not. He also said that
there was no direct evidence that
Camden actually cut Petino because
the cut may have come from some
other object during the scuffle.

Judge Hess decided that the
malicious wounding charge, known
in some states as felonious assault,
against Petino be sent before a grand
jury. Camden appealed his sentence
of 120 days in jail for the charge of
assault against a police officer,
Judge Hess said.

Tommy Coleman's charge of
malicious wounding was reduced to
assault. Coleman received a six
month jail sentence, suspen ded on
good behavior. Robert Ward receiv-
ed null process, or no punishment as
there was not enough evidence to pro-
secute.

Mumps outbreak strikes campus

 

By Marie Dunne
Co-editor

 

Several cases of mumps have been
confirmed on the Washington and
Lee campus this fall, according to
Robert M. Pickral, M.D., director of
the Student Health Center.

“T had personally never seen a
case of mumps until this fall,”’ said
Pickral, who has been with the health
center for four years and in private
practice for almost a decade.

The six or seven cases of mumps on
campus are unusual because they
are affecting students who were im-
munized during childhood against

the virus. In the cases that have been
clinically confirmed, only one stu-
dent had not been immunized.

The virus generally takes three to
four weeks to be confirmed through
tests, said Pickral. Students who
show symptoms now will not be con-
firmed as having the mumps until
three weeks from now.

According to Pickral, two factors
seem to be contributing to the high
number of cases on campus: the im-
munization may not be “‘holding’’ as
a student grows older and the closed
environment may allow the virus to
spread more easily.

In addition to the characteristic
swelling of the glands in the neck, the

Faculty petition asks

By Jessica Reynolds

Freshmen are not getting a good
look at the academic life at W&L,
said W. Lad Sessions, professor of

, philosophy.

Sessions said he gets the sense that
the early portion of the fall term is
very disruptive because the fresh-
man males are forced to worry about
their social life in fraternities at
W&L, making it hard to focus in the
classroom.

Sessions decided it was time to
place the academic aspects of the
school at the top.

In September, he circulated a peti-
tion among the faculty stating that
those who signed the petition believe
“there would be significant aca-
demic advantage to deferring
freshman fraternity rush until the
winter term’? and requested the
Students Affairs Committee (SAC) to
present some proposals on the issue
to the faculty by February 1988.

“It is important for students to
relate to one another before they
divide into groups,’’ said Sessions,
explaining that fraternities divide up
the freshmen before they have the
chance to form their own friendships.

“The primary emphasis at W&L
should be on academics, but by the
same token I do not think we will see
a substantial increase or improve-
ment [in grades] among the fresh-
men,” said Mark Farley, Interfrater-
nity Council (IFC) president.

Farley said in the fall of 1986, male
fraternity pledges had an average
grade point average (GPA) of 2.405
while the average GPA of non-
fraternity males was 2.58. He said
that the statistics show there is not
much difference in the GPA’s.

Farley said many of the professors
say they are tired of having freshmen
with hangovers in their Thursday
morning classes

SAC for deferred rush

“T think that if the faculty believes
that a deferred rush will prevent
freshmen from drinking or prevent
freshmen from participating in
fraternity parties, they are in for
more of an education than the
students,”’ said Farley.

The petition received 116
signatures from all departments ex-
cept ROTC and the law school, said
Lewis John, dean of students. He ad-
ded that the petition may not have
been circulated in those two areas.

“I was surprised at the reception of
the faculty. I did not think there
would be as much support,” said Ses-
sions.

Farley said he understood the
philosophical viewpoints of the facul-
ty’s reasons for deferred rush as
positive, but ‘I do not think the quali-
ty of academic life would be improv-
ed.”’

Farley said that a deferred rush is
not the answer and fraternities must
find a proper balance. He suggested
that rush continue to be held in the
fall and that it go as quickly as possi-
ble, so that students can get on with a
normal lifestyle.

Both Sessions and Farley foresee
the possible financial damage defer-
red rush can bring to the fraternities,
without the revenue that would usual-
ly come in with the new members.
Farley said this could strain the
fraternities’ ability to finance par-
ties.

But Sessions said it is not
necessary always to have parties at
fraternities. He suggested that
students could have dorm parties,
which would not be centered on the
fraternities.

“There would be a sense of class
and school unity,’’ he said

Sessions said he does not think the
fraternities can rush for an entire 12
weeks because of the heavy financial
burden as well as the time and
energy it will take

 

mumps virus can cause swelling of
the ovaries or testicles. According to
Pickral, none of the cases at
Washington and Lee have had that
symptom. Immunization may be a
factor in helping keep the W&L cases
from becoming severe and causing
swelling of the reproductive organs,
said Pickral.

Pickral said he sees no evidence
that the W&L cases may be caused
by a new strain of the mumps virus,
although it may be possible. There is
no evidence that affected students
were given ineffective immuniza-
tions, said Pickral.

The week-long Thanksgiving break
should help the situation by acting as

ee |

a unofficial quarantine, getting
students out of a closed environment
where the virus may spread more
easily, said Pickral.

Pickral said he will talk with the
state health department to determine
if there is cause to have an epidem-
iologist to study the cases, but hopes
that the Thanksgiving and Christmas
breaks will prevent further spread of
the virus.

“We'll just have to wait and see
when the students come back,” he
said.

Other than the W&L cases, there
have been no confirmed cases of
mumps in the Lexington and
Rockbridge area, said Pickral.

As IFC president, Farley said he
hopes that fraternities will continue
to stress the concept of responsible
drinking.

Farley said the SAC and IFC are
addressing the problems. He said
that one of the proposals that will be
presented to the faculty in February
will be a counterproposal from the
IFC.

Farley said he would have trouble
implementing a policy he believes is
detrimental to the fraternity system

‘I’m not out to get rid of the frater
nities, nor is this to reprimand the
fraternities,’ said Sessions, adding
that he does not believe the present
system is the only way to carry out
rush nor is it the best

Farley said that if rush is held in
the winter term, ‘‘the fraternities
will be tripping over themselves try-
ing to impress freshmen throughout
the fall term.”’

Not only will it cause a financial
burden, but a possible legal problem
as well, said Farley. The freshmen
will not be affiliated with the houses
and if something happens to a
freshman after drinking at a certain
fraternity, then the fraternity could
be placed in a difficult legal situa-
tion, he said

“The biggest liability to frater
nities concerns the possible injury of
people who are not affiliated with the
house,”’ said Farley

school [ just to get more financial aid
for their son or daughter],’’ said
DeCourcy.

The changes in the financial aid
laws do not include a grandfather
clause, and that bothers DeCourcy.

According to DeCourcy, many
juniors and seniors came to W&L
counting on the money they could
receive from GSL and their own
earnings. In several cases, students
decided they could come to W&L
rather than going to a less expensive
state school because they were able,
with financial aid, to cover the costs.

“As the kid moved through, every-
thing is sliced away after the fact,”
said DeCourcy. Students who were
once able to meet college costs may
now find themselves scrambling.

The impact of the changes in finan-
cial aid laws will probably not be felt
fully until January, when students
begin applying for financial aid for

In the long term, the changes could
mean fewer students applying to ex
pensive private colleges and more
people going to state schools, more
parents taking out mortgages to
cover college costs, and, perhaps,
more parents themselves going back
to school, said DeCourcy

The changes themselves are most
likely to achieve what they were
designed to do: lower the number of
people taking out guaranteed student
loans, said DeCourcy

DeCourcy suggested students try
to prepare for the problems the new
financial aid laws may cause

“Better to get a good deal of warn-
ing on it, so you can plan the best ap-
proach.”’

Students report theft of
valuables from library

 

 

“And here is our library, it is open 24
hours a day. We have study carrels
where you can leave anything.”

That is what the library staff at
W&L hears Student Recruitment tour
guides tell prospective students, said
Peggy Hays, publice services librar-
ian.

‘“‘We would rather the tour guides
did not stress ‘you can just leave
anything,’ because it is not true,’’ she
said.

JoAnn Wilson, public services
librarian, said she asked last year
that the point be omitted, but Mark
Farley, co-chairman of Student
Recruitment last year, said he was
not informed of such a request.

“T do not think that there is a tour
guide saying that you can leave
anything," said Farley, who is also
chairman of this year’s group

He added that if the tour guides are
misrepresenting the use of the car-
rels, then such an error does need to
be corrected, but he does not think
that they are presenting an unrealitic
view of the situation.

He also said he does not think the
prospective students are so naive as
to think that they could leave watch-
es and valuables lying around and ex-
pect to find them later.

Although there have been reports
of missing items, Farley said, ‘‘peo-
ple know that things are being taken
and it concerns them, but it does not
shake their view of the Honor
System.”

Farley believes it would be a
disservice to the library if tour
guides said it was an unsecure place

“There is a strong belief in the
Honor System and I think it is our
job, as tour guides, to represent that
faith,”’ he said

The staff at the

library said

students should not leave wallets,
calculators and valuables, and it
asks students to use common sense.

Farley agreed and said if students
leave valuables, they are leaving
themselves open to theft.

“There is a great honor system,
but to assume that W&L is a little
paradise is a myth,”’ said William
“Burr” Datz, assistant director of
security.

He said that the library’s 24-hour
accessibility is the problem because
it is difficult to monitor the coming
and going of everyone

“It is a Catch-22 situation, because
the library should be open 24 hours a
day, but because of the access, who
knows who comes and goes,”’ he said

W&L Security is aware that items
are being taken from the library and
has a patrolman monitoring the
building, but it said one is not enough

“*T would not leave anything around
where someone would take it,’’ said
Charles ‘‘Murph”’ Murray, director
of security.

Murray said that the reports of
missing items and_ stolen goods
“have been going ever since I’ve
been here.”’ He joined the W&L staff
in 1959.

Hays said that students leave
materials in the carrels so they will
not have to carry them back and
forth from their dorms to the library
She emphasized that caution must be
used as well as common sense about
the personal itmes being left in the
carrels

Brad Root, president of the Ex
ecutive Committee, said that
students must take a sensible ap
proach because the library is a public
facility and is very vulnerable to peo
ple from outside the University com
munity

Root said that freshmen are told
during orientation that personal pro

OPINION
Finances

When the new year rolls around, a large number of
students may be surprised at what the federal government
has in store for them.

Financial aid has been subject to government scrutiny as
of late and with the new tax laws, changes have been made.
Some of these changes will definitely discourage students
from attending more costly private schools, and will herd
them into the state schools. Some students may be forced to
abandon their private education for cheaper instruction
elsewhere.

At the core of these new regulations is a rule requiring
students to use 70 percent of their income to pay for their
education. This means students will no longer be able to ap-
ply only $1,000 of their summer earnings toward school.
Wages earned from jobs during the school year must also be
declared.

The case of dorm counselors shows the effect another rule
will have. In the past, students have become dorm counselors
partly to defray the cost of college. Now the value of the free
room and board they receive will be considered income. As a
result, dorm counselors will be taxed for tha income even
though they never receive cash income.

That is only one example of the inherent dangers of this
new system.

To make matters even worse there is no type of grand-
father clause to protect students who have already planned
their college education with financial aid. That means
students who have been enrolled at Washington and Lee for a
year or more may find out they can no longer afford to attend
school here. The least the government could do is agree not to
pull the rug out from under financial aid students already in
college.

Other victims of the new tax laws are parents. They are
now required to declare all their assets, not just their income.
So any family that owns, say, a house, will have to declare it
as an asset. Consequently, because the asset will make the
student ineligible to receive a GSL, the family must take out
a mortgage on the house to pay for an education.

There has been talk recently of plans to crack down on
former students who have defaulted on their GSLs, as well as
colleges with a high rate of defaulting students. These plans
make much more sense for saving the government money in
financial aid than the new tax laws. Instead of punishing
those who are trying to further their education, punish the
people who have cheated the government out of money. ;

Let’s hope no one will be forced to leave W&L because of
these new laws. But Director of Financial Aid John DeCourcy
is correct to warn students to understand the coming changes
and be prepared. Only through careful preparation can stu-
dents ensure their future education.

Trust

Students at Washington and Lee take the Honor System
very seriously, and trust their fellow students to an excep-
tionally high degree. This can be seen in the unlocked doors,
the unattended bicycles and the backpacks left waiting in
academic buildings.

However, students need to realize that sometimes their
trust may be violated.

It is not other students that people must fear. It is the peo-
ple that come on to our campus that do not fall under our
Honor System.

A perfect example is the University Library. Students
realize that they can keep their study carrel just by leaving
their books and such in it (although students do have to sign
up for the carrels before taking them over). It is wonderfully
convenient to have all the materials necessary for studying
waiting in the library whenever they are needed.

Unfortunately, students have often elected to leave
valuable personal belongings, such as cassette players, in
their carrels. This is unwise for a number of reasons, but par-
ticularly because it tempts people from outside the W&L
community to steal it.

The library is a 24-hour building. It is open to students from
schools other than W&L. To leave valuables lying around is
foolish because it is virtually impossible for the library staff
to keep every potential thief out of the building, especially at
night. :

This is not to say that every visiting student or townsperson
is a thief. It is merely to warn W&L students to be careful in
their trust of the Honor System. Although it works.wonderful-.
ly within our community, outside W&L not everyone
understands or abides by it.

Honor system revisions depend
on interested students who apply

 

MY VIEW
By Margaret Pimblett

 

How about another column on the
state of the Honor System at Wash-
ington and Lee?

I don’t mean glorifying the Honor
System as the backbone of our entire
educational environment. That’s
been done before.

Neither do I wish to extol the
memory of St. Robert of Lee, the fine
founder of the system as we know it,
who brought the tiny Washington Col-
lege back from the terrors of the War
between the States to occupy a posi-
tion of might in the world of educa-
tion for young men (and now women)
of promise. We all know how much
General Lee did for our university.

What I would like to do is tell you
about an opportunity that is available
to every student at Washington and
Lee.

Is there anything, anything at all,
about the Honor System that you
think should be changed? Specifical-
ly, should anything be changed in the
White Book, the short but vital
treatise that defines the expectations

Stretching

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

The Thanksgiving holiday begins
tomorrow and for many students it
will be the first time home since
September. Of course, Thanksgiving
is a good time to relax with the fami-
ly, eat good food, and see’old friends.
But don’t lose perspective; the most
important activity for any authentic
college student is to go back to their
high schools and lie! Washington and
Lee students who are bound by the
Honor Code cannot do this and in-
stead return to their high schools on-
ly to stretch the truth.

To become truly adept at stretch-
ing the truth (lying) one must follow

 

 

and the administration of the system
itself?

This year, Brad B. Root, the presi-
dent of the Executive Committee of
the student body, has called for ap-
plications for the White Book Revi-
sion Committee.

The committee will review the
policies set out in the White Book and
determine if any of those policies
should be changed. :

The Honor System is supposed to
represent the views of the current
student generation. What better way
to guarantee that it in fact does that,
than by allowing members of that
generation to study the White Book
and make corrections if they see fit?

Sounds like a great idea to me. In
fact, it sounded like such a great idea
that I thought students would be
clamoring to be appointed to the
committee and begging Mr. Root to
consider them for the positions
available.

That hasn’t exactly been the case,
however. The deadline for applica-
tions was extended several times to
give more people time to submit their
applications.

Unfortunately, even allowing for
noted procrastinators like myself to
finally get around to writing a letter
of application, only about a_ half

dozen people did so:

Mr. Root said he had hoped to have
at least 25 students would apply, so
that the Executive Committee could
choose about a dozen well-qualified
students to work on the revisions.

Well, maybe I should have started
this column as an overview of student
apathy at sports events and just ex-
tended it to encémpass the Honor
System.

But it’s a bit scary to think that
nearly the entire student body simply
ignored the chance to be actively in-
volved in the Honor System.

So, I took a poll to determine if
students really were apathetic, or
maybe just uniformed. I interviewed
the journalism students who were
slaving away at the computer ter-
minals in Reid Hall to see if any of
them had known that such a thing as
the White Book Revision Committee
existed, and that applications had
been accepted earlier in the term.

Of the six students working, only
one had any idea that the E.C. had
called for applications, and he wasn’t
really sure what it was all about. And
remember, these were journalism
students, who are supposed to have
some idea of what’s news.

This brought up an entirely dif-
ferent problem. Maybe the E.C.

didn’t publicize enough, so that
students would know what was going
on.
The formation of the committee
was noted several times in the of-
ficial minutes of the E.C. that are
posted around the campus, and was
mentioned in a Ring-tum Phi article
about an E.C. meeting.

Perhaps the E.C. should have hung
posters announcing the application
deadlines, so that the many folks who
don’t have time to read all of the
items in the E.C. minutes or who
don’t read the Phi word for word
would have known about the commit-
tee.

Since the E.C. didn’t hang floures-
cent orange 11 x 14 inch posters on
every door, column, and _ bulletin
board on campus, no wonder the
average student didn’t know any-
thing about it.

Well, now you have no excuse for
being clueless. Here is your notice.
And you'll have another chance dur-
ing winter term to apply—the E.C.
has decided to try again and ask for
applications in January.

And, lest you think that I’m not
practicing what I preach, my ap-
plication was one of the few that was
recieved before the deadline in Oc-
tober. Now it’s your turn.

I hope my examples will come in
handy when you go back to your high
school and tell lies (1 mean stretch
the truth). In the event that you feel
guilty about stretching the truth,
though you shouldn’t, just remember
that the basis of any high school con-
versation is lying. For example, high
school student number 1: Did you
hear that Jack was ina car accident?
He broke his arm.

High school student number 2: I
heard he’ll never walk again.

High school student number 3:
Jack’s dead! (The truth: Jack had a
fender bender. )

Good luck with the tall tales at your
high school and if you feel really con-
fident try the same thing on your
family.

 

 

To the Editors:

As a senior, and thus a member of Washington
and Lee's last ‘‘all-male”’ class, I’ve had to ac-
cept, and even learn to live with, my school’s
decision to become coeducational. However, one
aspect of that female invasion remains par-
ticularly annoying: the allowance/tolerance of
women in the library.

Women must be allowed to use the facilities, I
suppose, but (as I’ve sadly come to realize) cer-
tain restrictions need to be imposed. Why? Well
for starters, it seems that no matter when—day
or night—there are always five or 10 or 50 silly
wenches running amuck on each of the library’s
five floors. Giggling, gossiping, and (dare I say
it? )—bitching—may be the normal behavior at-
tributed to W&L’s version of the fairer sex, but
leave it behind in the dorms! With tests and

papers burdening us with their ponderous
weight, how can studying in a theoretically
“quiet” library be achieved when one is con-
stantly harrassed by little lasses evoking high-
school memories in thought, voice, and action?
Answer: it can’t be done. Solution: ban women
from the library.

A ban is necessary, though to hope for one in
the near future would be to chase an elusive
dream. If not a total ban on women in the
biblioteque, then at least keep them corraled in
the fourth floor smoking lounges—out of sight,
mind, and earshot. In addition to relieving the
noise problem, there would finally be an ade-
quate number of carrels for the W&L men who
rightly deserve them. How about keeping the
library open only to males and senior girls? The
transfers from the neighboring women’s colleges
have enough maturity and poise to handle

themselves in a public place without embarrass-
ing themselves by acting like 4-year-olds. If
women must be permitted, then only from
2:00-6:00 in the morning—and provide free, man-
datory muzzles.

These are but a few suggestions from a
veritable cornucopia of solutions—hopefully
they’ll be put to good use. This isn’t a blight on
women in general, they are necessary after all,
and they remain but helpless prisoners of their
nature. Latent in that nature hides a vague
silliness, lying dormant, only to be sprung upon
us as a manifestation of its owner’s childish
transformation once the library doors slowly sw-
ing shut. I hope that W&L women will see the fol-
ly in their ways and begin to show a little more
common courtesy.

Peer counselors are
Called ‘listening ear’

 

By Jessica Reynolds
Staff Reporter

 

Where do students go if they are
having problems dealing with school,
stress, alcohol, drugs, parents, social
life or depression and are not comfor-
table talking with a professional
psychologist?

The peer counseling program at

, Washington and Lee University pro-

-~

vides students at the university with
an alternative.

The program started as an idea in
the fall of 1986 and was available to
students in the winter of 1987, said
Dr. James Worth, university counsel-
ing psychologist.

Worth said the idea for a peer
counseling group is not new, but in
the years before coeducation, he did
not believe students would have been
as receptive to the program.

Since the start of the program
there have been several calls to the
hotline and several peer counselors
have been contacted individually for
counseling, Worth said.

“Last year nearly all peer
counselors had some contacts. It was
not a case of heavy usage, but the
fact that they were being used says it
is worth keeping,”’ he said.

The group has nearly doubled in
size from last year. Worth attributes
this to the fact that the program has
become more visible, which has en-
couraged more students to partic-
ipate in it.

give of themselves. If they are given
an opportunity, they will help the

Satellite interview allows

Massachusetts Governor Michael
Dukakis appeared in W&L’s Northen
Auditorium via satellite on Friday,
November 14. The live interview
from Texas A&M’s Rutter Theatre
Complex was sponsored by the
Young Democrats and the Mock Con-
vention.

More than 50 schools across the na-

* tion participated in the satellite inter-
, view by telephoning with questions

following the governor’s brief open-

¢ ing remarks.

t

“The next president of the United

, States should be someone who brings

strong economic leadership,”’

»Dukakis said, who has based much of

his campaign on the “economic
miracle’’ in Massachusetts.

“T hope this is an election where

+young people become actively involv-

ed,” he said. ‘I hope that as much as

 

 

 

community,” he said.

The peer counselors were chosen
not only for their desire to reach out
to other students, but for their own
ability to overcome problems of their
own, said Worth.

‘“‘We want somebody who has pro-
bably had intense problems and life
stresses and have pulled their act
together through counseling, faith, or
maturity.’ Worth said.

“They are compassionate, mature,
good listeners, empathetic and
capable of earning the respect of
students,’’ said Worth.

Worth explained that the peer
counselors are not presently in the
middle of a problem, nor did they all
have intense problems, but ‘‘they
have the ability to look at the pain in
their own life and look at their own
hurt and understand the pain of
others.”

In order to insure that peer
counselors are capable of taking on
the challenge of peer counseling,
they are interviewed and go through
a mandatory and intensive training
program, explained Worth.

The first training program lasts a
full day, and subsequent sessions are
held for half a day once a month, said
Worth.

The training that peer counselors
receive is life-long, said Bryan
Bishop, head peer counselor and
third-year law student.

“The first priority is to have the
training so I can make the difference
for someone with my experience and
background,” he said.

Bishop said the experience as a
peer counselor doesnot stop at W&L,
but can be carried into careers, fami-

John Kennedy inspired my genera-
tion, I can inspire yours.”

Washington and Lee was the last of
approximately 10 schools able to ask
a question on the air. The question
was asked by law school student
Samuel Conner:

“Governor, much of your cam-
paigning has focused on the vastly
improved economic situation in
Massachusetts, for which you have
taken much credit. However, in
response to the shutdown of the GM
plant in Framingham, Mass., which
resulted in the layoff of 3,700
workers, you said, ‘Every time
something happens around here it
has little to do with my political cam-
paign.’ On the surface, it seems that
you are claiming responsibility for
the victories, but divorcing yourself
from the losses. Is this the sort of
‘teflon’ policy we can expect from
you if elected president?”

The governor smiled as the quota-
tion was cited. “Unfortunately, cars

fill out applications after the first of
the year,’’ she said. Like other real
estate agencies, Mead Associates re-
quires people to fill out applications
before they even discuss options
available.

In addition to the most basic infor-
mation such as the applicant’s name,
address and age, applications, also
called tenant questionnaires by some
local agencies, usually request infor-
mation concerning the type of pro-
perty desired by the applicant, the
number of roommates involved, the
price range desired and whether the

“The whole focus of peer counsel-
ing is to provide students with a very
accessible and appealing resource
for talking about their problerns. A
student can understand another stu-
dent more quickly,” said Worth,
supervisor of the program.

“One of the most important things
we learned in the training session
was how to listen in a different way.
We really did not know how hard it

the country

Once the applications are received,
real estate agencies then begin the
task of finding an available place to
match the applicant's request. Hous-
ing is usually distributed on a ‘“‘first
come, first served”’ basis.

Local realtors say that most
students usually prefer to rent apart-
ments rather than houses, and that
they would rather live in town than in
the country, although there are many
exceptions.

“Living in town is more popular,

especially among girls, because they
like to be in walking distance to
school,’’ said salesman Mike Flint of
Mays Real Estate. He added that the
decision to rent a house in the coun-
try usually depends on whether
transportation exists for the
students.

Tamara Hamric, realtor at Vita &
Associates, stressed the importance
of students making appointments to
speak with realtors. She also said it
helps if students have an idea of what
they are looking for before visiting
the realtor.

 

 

we were listening to him sympa-
thetically,’’ said Dana Anstine, a
member of the peer counseling team.
Dorm counselors and resident ad-
visors are available to help students
with their problems, but after a stu-
dent leaves the dorms, they are no
longer a resource. Peer counselors
can fill that void, said Baxter Sharp,
a peer counselor at the university.
“The program is a group state-
ment that it is not abnormal to have
needs; you are human if you have
problems,”’ said Bishop. a
“We are the listening ear,” said

a hotline (463-8999) beginning after Thanksgiving break.

Meredith Walker, assistant head of
the peer counselor group.

Although the program was not fre-
quently used last year, she hopes it
will be utilized more this year.

“It is a slow thing, but it is gradual-
ly beginning to grow as more people
are learning about the program,”’ she
said.

Sharp said the number of ap-
plicants shows that the program is
more visible. Last year, people did
not know much about the program,
but Sharp said this is changing.

Although there are a few nine
month leases available, most local

leases are for a full year. Many
realtors therefore have waiting lists
for students who have made a deci

sion as to which house or apartment
they wish to live in, and some, such
as Hamric, encourage students to

check between semesters for newly
available apartments

All realtors encourage students to
begin making plans early in the year

and then contact the realtors as soon
as possible to be assured of getting
the type of housing desired.

The hotline number, 463-8999, will
not go into effect until Nov. 30, the
day after students come back from
Thanksgiving break.

The hotline operation hours are
Sunday-Thursday: 7 p.m.-11 p.m.;
Friday and Saturday: 8 p.m.-12 p.m.

Students can call or meet with any
of the 26 peer counselors in con-
fidence, said Worth.

The peer counselors’ goal is to
“provide immediate and non-
threatening mental health resource
as a first step,” he said.

expect that production in that plant

He pointed out the Massachusetts
government’s response to the closing
of a General Dynamics shipyard. He
emphasized the importance of
‘Tresponding] quickly, sensitively,
helpfully,”’ by teaching ‘‘new skills
and training if workers are laid off.”’

Mock Convention co-chairperson
Chip Gist explained, ‘We came up
with six questions, and put them in
priority order...and we were able to
ask our first choice.”

The questions were composed by
Stephen Sears, William Maddox,
Chip Gist, Sam Conner, and Young
Democrats President Kristi Good-
man.

Questions asked by other schools
covered topics ranging from apar-
theid to acid rain.

Gist commented, ‘‘On the whole, I
don’t feel Dukakis really influenced

anyone’s opinion either one way or
the other because of his vague
responses. But the event was
beneficial because it allowed
students across the country to direct-
ly interact with a Presidential can-
didate.”’

Goodman was more favorably im-
pressed with Dukakis. ‘I thought he
did a real good job in explaining his
particular views on _ various
issues...It gave people a chance to
find out more than they knew
before.”’

As to the overall event, Goodman
said, ‘‘I was real pleased to see
Young Dem’s there as well as some
College Republicans and others who
were just interested.”’

Approximately 50 people attended
the presentation.

Wa&L sponsors Ethics Institute

 

By Betsy Parkins

For 13 years now, W&L has been
host for the Legal Ethics Institute,
bringing lawyers from across the
country and students from W&L
together to discuss the sensitive issue
of legal ethics.

Two weekends ago the 13th annual
institute took place as 28 profes-
sionals and students met for a two-
and-a-half day conference.

The purpose of the program is two-
fold: one, it brings together profes-
sionals, mostly alumni, who refresh
their memories on current trends in
ethical rules, and two, it enables

legal ethics students to get a feel for
what “‘real life’ lawyers face in their
everyday practice.

“They talk about situations,
hypothetical sometimes, and cases
that would benefit both students and
professionals,” explained Nancy
Hanna of the Society and Professions
Program.

This year the Institute focused on
the role of lawyers as providers of
free legal services for the poor and
commercialism within the legal
field.

“We could see the difficult deci-
sions that attorneys have to make,”
said Cheryl Barrett, a junior in the

In the Institute’s keynote address,
titled, ‘‘Will Commercialism Kill
Self-Regulation?”’ Joseph M. Spivey
III commented on the problems fac-
ed by the legal field today. He pointed
out that because more and more
lawyers are joining the work force
every year, there is less and less self
regulation. If attorneys are to regain
their status in society they must be
willing to hand down harsher punish
ments to negligent attorneys.

Spivey also addressed the problem
of attorney advertising. Should
lawyers be allowed to advertise? And
if they are, should they be regulated?

ROTC Rangers finish well in competition

 

By George G. Sparacio
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee Universi-
ty ROTC Ranger team fared well at
the 1987 Fourth Brigade Ranger
Challenge Competition at Fort
Meade, Md., on Oct. 23-25.

Each Ranger squad from par-
ticipating schools sends nine
members to the competition each
year, testing skills such as basic
marksmanship, weapons assembly,
construction of a rope bridge and
physical stamina.

Led by Cadet Major and Ranger
Commander Christopher Beckert,
the team finished fairly well, coming
in 13th out of the 25 teams. The team
did best in the road march, finishing
ninth.

Although the cadets did not win the
competition, Beckert said that they
were pleased with their performance
and know what to improve on for next
year. He also said that the team will
do much better next year since only
four seniors will be graduating.

“You have to lose before you know
how to win,”’ said Beckert. With five
team members returning next year,
they have a good shot at winning the
title.

ROTC Rangers practice construction of a one-rope bridge for the Ranger

Challenge Competition.

The Ranger program at W&L has
two major goals. Being a Ranger
gives ROTC members extra practice
and experience in Ranger skills, such
as rappelling, spelunking and patroll-
ing. In addition, it gives the cadets in-
tensive training in regular army
skills, such as marksmanship and

communications.

Beckert said that in the first year
of the program, a Ranger is taught
basic military skills. In following
years, the Rangers teach these skills
to junior members of the club.

Beckert said, “The ROTC depart-

ment here at W&L is top notch. The
Ranger program just allows the
cadet to practice his skills in depth.”’

The Rangers have an orientation
weekend for freshmen planned some
time in the early spring, when the
freshmen will have a chance to rap-
pel and fire the M-16 rifle.

Computer Science’s cup runneth over

 

By Melinda Conkling
Staff Reporter

 

The sign on the door in Robinson
Hall said, ‘‘Class will meet in Parmly
305.’ Computer Science 110 was be-
ing held in Parmly for 81 reasons—81
students in one class.

Due to an overabundance of Com-
puter Science students, the computer
science class was being conducted in
a classroom that could contain 81
students. Yet the question
remained—How could one professor
effectively instruct 81 students with
individual promblems and anxieties?

Answer: Teacher’s Assistants.

Associate Professor of Computer
Science Kenneth Lambert divided
the students into six sections—each
directed by a teacher’s assistant
(t.a.). Lambert lectures four times a
week in the classroom and the t.a.’s
meet with their students at obli-
gatory “‘help sessions”’ twice a week.

The t.a.’s_ responsibilities are
varied. At help sessions they answer
student questions regarding the
week’s assignment and attempt to
solve any mechanical difficulties.

According to Lambert there were
two main reasons for establishing a
t.a. program.

“The first was because like any
science course, students need atten-
tion outside the classroom and more

For those women who are in-

ch.

Last Wednesday evening she led
the group of nine students in its se-
cond meeting this year. The topic of
discussion for that week was Miriam,

help than a single professor can
possibly give. The t.a.’s also benefit
from this experience. It helps up-
perclassmen who are majoring in
computer science to deal with people
who know very little about their (the
t.a.’s) prospective field.”’

Lambert approached the t.a.’s at
the beginning of the '87-’88 school
year. Most of the assistants are com-
puter science majors and he was
already familiar with their
knowledge of computer science.

The benefits of being a t.a. are
equally rewarding for students and
ta: 5;

“T think there is a definite need for
individual help. There are too many
computer science students,” stated
freshman Mary Hampson.

“T’ve gotten a better understand-
ing of Pascal than when I was taking
the courses and I’ve met lots of
freshmen who otherwise I probably
would have never met,” stated senior
Etienne Cambon. ‘‘Dr. Lambert had
81 students whom he knew he
couldn’t give the proper attention to.
He needed us to thoroughly grade
projects and check student pro-
gress.”

Being a t.a. requires two to four
hours a week of student time. The
help sessions last about an hour each
and the grading of programs takes
about one hour.

Student satisfaction was a definite
goal for the t.a.’s. “I think student

Robinson and former R.E. Lee

such a group two years ago when

“But because of our schedules, and
being new women ourselves, we just
couldn’t find the time to get it
started,” Robinson recalls.

This year, Assoc. Dean of Students
Anne Schroer suggested organizing
the group.

She arranged for the Women’s
Center to be used as a meeting place.

satisfaction is better than in pre-
vious years,’ stated sophomore Scott
Jackson. ‘‘As long as the grading is
fair and everything is justified I
would not complain. There may be an
irregularity in the grading scheme
but that’s just like a course with two
different teachers. Dr. Lambert
briefly reviews most of the pro-
grams. If a student doesn’t agree
with the grade I give them Dr.
Lambert reconsiders it. I have to be
sure the grade I’m giving is jus-
tified.”

The grading process is not totally
in the t.a.’s control. The t.a.’s have a
correct program solution that is

“This semester no one has bombed

And next year? According to
Lambert, “‘if the enrollment remains

to get a basic idea from the students
of what they thought the discussion
group should entail.

It was generally agreed upon that,
because a lot is expected from the
female students here, they could pro-
bably identify with many of the
female figures of biblical times who
were under similar circumstances.

“...These women in the Scrip-
ture...were the best and brightest of
their generation,” said Robinson. “I
proposed that idea and think that a
chord struck there with what those
characters might have to say [to
women today].”’

Sophomore Kristi Goodman was
glad that such a group had finally

been organized. ‘‘It’s just good to get
some of the girls together....She
(Robinson) is really in tune with
young people...good at com-
municating.”’

“T like it a lot,’ commented junior
Courtney Harpold, “because I don’t
know anything about women in the
Bible.”’

She added that having a woman
minister as a leader was an especial-
ly interesting aspect of the group.

Discussions are held every
Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. in the
Women’s Center on the bottom floor
of the University Center. All female
students are encouraged to come.

There have been eight reports of
missing items compared to the 15
reports last year, the security staff
said.
“Crime is 95 percent opportunity
and 5 percent motivation,” said Datz.
Elizabeth Smith, a junior at W&L,
said that she had a book bag taken,
which had her checkbook and a few
dollars in it. A $33 check was later
forged at a Lexington business.
Although her things were taken,
she continues to use her carrel

“We will address this issue and
work in conjunction with the library

He said that the E.C. tells the stu-
dent body that this type activity will
not be tolerated and if reports are
passed on to the E.C., they will be in- *

Root said he understands the

Hoyas humble the|

Generals in finale

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee football
Generals ended their 1987 season
with a 28-14 loss to the Georgetown
Hoyas Saturday on Wilson Field,
leaving head coach Gary Fallon
disappointed about the loss but not
about the season overall.

“The players stayed together
thoughout the year, no matter what
happened. They played with intensity
in every game,”’ said Fallon, whose
teams have won more games than
any other football coach in school
history.

“IT am disappointed with the loss
and our final record (3-6), but that is
not an indication of the way I feel
about this team.”’

After a late arrival on the field, the
Generals received the opening kick-
off only to punt three plays later. In
fact, most of the first quarter was an
exchange of punts. The only scoring
threat of the first period came on a
missed field goal attempt by W&L
freshman kicker Carter Quayle The
drive began when W&L linebacker
Tom Skeen intercepted a pass by
Hoya quarterback Matt Zebrowski
but ended when the kick sailed wide
from 28 yards out.

The Hoyas took over and, three
* plays into the second period, kicker

‘ma

Tom Timperman put Georgetown on
the scoreboard with a 39-yard field
goal. The Hoyas led, 3-0, with 13:36
left in the first half.

After another exchange of punts,-
Quayle missed yet another field goal,
this time from 42 yards out. The
Hoyas took over but fumbled on first
down, and the loose football was
recovered by the Generals. W&L
wasted no time in scoring, as
sophomore quarterback Phil Samp-
son hit split end Hugh Finklestein on
a 27-yard TD pass on first down. The
first-year law student suffered a
wrist injury on the play, however,
and left the game for good. Quayle’s
extra point gave the Generals their
first lead of the game, 7-3, with 6:02
remaining in the half.

The Hoyas drove 49 yards in 11
plays and pulled within one on a 26-
yard Timperman field goal with 1:50
left in the second quarter. After a
short W&L posession and a Skeen
punt, the half ended on a missed 30-
yard field goal attempt by Timper-
man, leaving W&L on top, 7-6.

Georgetown was a different and |
much better football team in the sec-
ond half, outscoring W&L 22-7. The
Hoyas received the opening kickoff
and drove 76 yards in nine plays, in-
cluding a 26-yard scoring pass from
Zebrowski to tight end Joseph

Clark’s effort earns
regional honors

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

For the Washington and Lee cross

country program, last Saturday’s

| South-Southeast Regional Champion-

_ ship at Christopher Newport College

_ was an opportunity to show off some
- of its individual talent.

Junior Bill Clark of the men’s team
_ ran the eight-kilometer course in a
personal best of 25:49, good enough
for 15th place and _all-South-
Southeast honors. Freshman. Paige
Cason of the women’s team took 21st
place in a time of 19:38, good enough
to once again lower her all-course
school record.

“I was really pleased,”’ said Clark.
“I had my best time ever for eight
kilometers. I guess I just went down
there ready to run.”

Clark defeated fellow teammate
and senior co-captain Scott Rippeon
for the first time this season. Rippeon
was the General’s No. 1 runner for
every meet this season but, accord-
ing to head coach Dick Miller, Rip-
peon was not quite 100 percent for the

' regional meet.

“Scott’s been running the last cou-
ple of weeks with a little hamstring
’ pull,” said Miller. ‘Nothing serious.
Bill just turned in the best perfor-
mance he’s ever turned in, that’s all
there is to it.”’

'  Rippeon finished 18th in 25:57 with

freshman Kennon Walthal (55th,
28:32) and seniors Richard Norris
(59th, 28:38) and Joe Geitner (60th,
28:56) rounding out the scorers for
W&L. The Generals finished eighth
out of 12 teams in the team standings
with American College of Puerto
Rico the surprise winner of the
region.

“Nothing happened. We just faced
some better teams,’ said Miller.
“This American College of Puerto
Rico blew everybody away. Nobody
expected that from them.”’

Miller was pleased with the
General’s season overafl‘and is op-
timistic about next season. Clark
echoed these sentiments.

“Next year we will be looking
good,” he said. ‘‘This year we started
slow, but we got our act together
when we ran against teams in the
{Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence].”’

For the women’s team, Cason was
the one who definitely had her act
together. On the flat and fast course,
Cason broke 20 minutes for the first
time this season and was the ODAC’s
top finisher in the region. Freshman
Shawn Wert (32nd, 20:54), junior
Anne Geary (36th, 21:31) and
freshmen Margaret Boyd and Pat
Lopes (50th, 22:48 and 5lst, 22:54
respectively) were the other scorers
for the Generals. W&L finished

seventh out of eight teams, well
behind Mary Washington who won
the meet.

Polo ends
season on

sour note

From Staff Reports

 

 

The Washington and Lee water
polo team’s dreams of playing in the
NCAA championships were thwarted
by its own “pensive” offense at the
Easterii Championships Saturday
and Sunday in Annapolis, Md.

The Generals, seeded fourth in the

East, lust their opening game to fifth-
seed Bucknell, 15-8, putting them out
of contention. W&L later beat Army,
97, and lost to the University of
Arkansas/Little Rock 8-46. The top
two finishers in the Eastern Cham-
pionships receive bids to play for the
national championship.

“I arn disappointed that we didn’t
give our best effort. Offensively we
were not all there. We were just too
pensive and not in the flow,”’ said
head coach Page Remillard.

W&L finished the year with a 24-4
record and won the Southern League
Championship. ‘‘Uniess you win the
national championship there is
always something you can look at
which your team could have done
better. We could have played better
last weekend, but it does not take
away from the great season we had,”’
said Remillard.

Canfield: Team will
shoot the 3-pointer

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Changes. That’s what’s going to
happen to the Washington and Lee
basketball team in the upcoming
season. Changes in offense, changes
in attitude and, most importantly,
changes in performance.

The Generals open their season
this weekend by playing host in the
W&L Tip Off Tournament, featuring
teams from Newport News Appren-
tice, Welsey College and the Univer-
sity of the South.

Last season in college basketball,
the NCAA passed the three-point shot
rule, setting the distance at a measly
19’6”’. Last season, W&L head coach
Verne Canfield said he didn’t like the
rule and wasn’t going to incorporate
the shot into his offense. Last season,
the Generals watched as opposing
teams buried three-pointer after
three-pointer, resulting in W&L's
15-10 regular season record and an
early first-round exit from post-
season play.

This season, Canfield, starting his
24th year as head coach, has taken a
180-degree turn in his thinking about
that little strip of tape on the Warner
Center floor.

“We have designated three-point
shooters,’ he said. ‘It’s a very in-
tegral part of our offense. I’ve gone
on record saying I don’t like the rule,
but we are going to deal with it
because I really didn’t coach well
against it last year. We would like to
make five to six three-pointers a
game.”

The change in offensive strategy is
not the only alteration made in this
year’s squad. Canfield predicts that
the personnel he puts on the floor is
going to show more character and
leadership.

“You'll see some guys playing with
perhaps a little more heart,”’ he said.
“A little more of simple, basic want-
ing to win. That's extremely impor-
tant to me right now—that we estab-
lish that attitude. I think we had
some slippage in that area in the last
couple of years.”’

One player that unquestionably
showed character last year was Jef-
ferson Harralson. Harralson, the
team leader in scoring and reboun-
ding, finished 11th on W&L’s all-time
scoring list with 1,219 points, Unfor-
tunately for the Generals, Harralson
picked up his diploma in June.

“You don’t replace a player like
Jefferson,’ said Canfield, “simply
because he was a very fine athlete. I
don’t think any one person is going to
doit. We've got to doit as a team, and
that’s more in line with our thinking.
Good players come and go and you
don’t worry about replacing them,
you worry about what you got.”

The Generals have four seniors
returning, with guard Steve Hancock
the only player who sterted con-
sistently. The other seniors are
center Harmon Harden and forward
Gary Schott, who are penciled in as
probable starters, and center/for-
ward Lou Trosch, who will see plenty
of time coming off the bench. The
other starters for W&L will be junior
point guard Manny Klump = and
freshman forward Ed Hart.

As for the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference, Canfield predicts
the usual powers of Roanoké and
Emory and Henry to be leading the
pack, but is also looking out for the
Scots from Maryville. ‘

“Maryville will probably surprise

everybody,’’ he said. “‘They have got
everybody back and three transfers
who are ‘impact’ players.” The

Generals finished 4th in the con-
ference a year ago with an 8-6 record.

Cesare. A two-point conversion pass
from Zebrowski to split end Greg
Adami gave the Hoyas a 14-7 lead

After three plays by the W&L of-
fense, Skeen again came into punt,
and the Hoyas again put on a scoring
drive. Georgetown traveled 77 yards
in 13 plays to score on a one-yard
carry by the Hoyas’ all-time rushing
leader, junior tailback Dean Lowry
Timperman’s extra point gave
Georgetown a 21-7 lead with 3:47 left
in the third period

But three great plays by junior run-
ning back Tony Waskiewicz put the
Generals right back in the game.
After freshman Mason Pope return-
ed the Hoya kickoff to the W&L 33,
Waskiewicz ran for fifteen yards on
one play and 29 on the next. Two
plays later, he scored on a 22-yard
pass from Sampson. Quayle’s kick
pulled W&L to within seven with 2:15
left in the third quarter

Georgetown was in possession and
driving to begin the final period and
scored with 13:13 left in the game on
Lowry’s second touchdown of the
afternoon, a 39-yard pass from
Zebrowski. Timperman’s extra point
put the Hoyas back up by 14.

W&L had three more chances to try
and cut into the Georgetown lead but
fell short all three times. First,
Sampson was intercepted by Hoya
linebacker Joe Pecoraro with 9:16
left. The Generals second drive
began after Zebrowski was_ in-
tercepted by W&L freshman corner-
back Clark Wight, but Sampson was
sacked on first down and threw three
incompletions.

The Hoyas took over on downs, ran
three plays and punted. Sampson
returned to face a first down at the
W&L 34 with only 1:52 left. After driv-
ing to midfield, Fallon pulled most of
his starters and ran out the clock.

Swimmers are ready

 

From Staff Reports

 

The 1986-87 season for both the
Washington and Lee men’s and
women’s swimming teams will be a
hard act to follow.

The men’s team had an 8-1 record
and dominated the Tri-State Con-
ference, beating second-place
Frostburg by 125 points.

THe women's team, in just its sec-
ond Year of operation and with just 10
swimmers on the roster, had a winn-
ing record (5-4) and a perfect Old
Dominion Athletic Conference record
(4-0).

In the freestyle sprints, W&L is
blessed with a number of proven per-
formers. Junior all-American Jeff
Bercaw, who was eighth in the 50-
yeard freestyle at the NCAA Cham-
pionships a year ago, and junior
David Reavy, an NCAA participant
in 1987 and the school record holder
in the 200-yard free (1:43.83), are two
of many swimmers who will score
points for W&L in those events.

The most experienced long-
distance freestyle swimmer is junior
Moose Herring, who owns W&L’s
second-best time in the 1000
(10:04.11) and third-best in the 1650
(16:55.90).

The backstroke events should also
be a team strength with the return of
sophomore all-American David

Olson, who placed seventh in the
NCAA championships in the 200-yard
backstroke last year. He holds the
school record in both the 100 (54:04)
and 200 (1:56.23).

The women will be entering year
three as a team, but is already
developing a winning tradition
according to Remillard.

This year’s team has 16 swimmers
on the roster and seems to have an
excellent balance for both dua4-and
championship meets.

The most notable returnee is junior
all-American Elizabeth Miles, who
owns five school records. Miles earn-
ed her all-American award in 1986 in
the long-distance freestyle events,
but did not swim in last year’s NCAA
Championships because of a broken
foot. This year she is fully recovered
and ready to lead her team again.

Swimmers to watch are: sopho-
more Kris Amoroso, who holds the
school records in the 100-yard back
(1:07.14) and the 200-yard back
(2:26.05); junior Nancy Whalen, who
has the school record in the 50-yard
free (27:06); sophomore Debbie
Grove, who has school records in the
100-yard fly (1:06.60), the 200-yard fly
(2:21.93), the 200-yard IM (2:20.72)
and the 400-yard IM (5:01.72); and
sophomore Heather Logan, who has
the school record in the 100-yard
breaststroke (1:15.14) and the 200-
yard breaststroke.

 

Shades on sports
By Mike Shady

Sports Editor

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nice job, Mr. Chase

I like reading The Lexington News-Gazette’s sports page because |
like Sports Editor Doug Chase’s column, ‘‘From the Sideline.’” Why?
Well, because Mr. Chase has a rare talent—he’s able to get personal
with his audience without being boring and without sounding fake. Mr.
Chase is genuinely interesting and sincere.

I wish I could say the same for those sports columnists at The
Washington Post. Let me ask you one question: Have you ever noticed
how one of those guys always writes a column on the Redskins’ game?
How many sidebars do you need for one football game? I want to know
what these guys really think and feel about all sports, not whether or
not they admire Jay Schroeder for his passing arm. The Post’s pro-
blem is simple. Too much fluff, not enough stuff. Ken Denlinger,
Thomas Boswell and Andrew Somethingorother (I can’t even recall
his last name, that’s how memorable his writing is) have a bad habit
of glossing over issues without really giving any opinions or
arguments of substance.

Another gripe. What ever happened to a columnist’s sense of
humor? Is Sports Illustrated the only place where I can read
something funny? The Philadelphia Inquirer is just as bad as The Post
in this area. It’s a game and funny things happen in a game. Why is
everyone so damn serious all the time? Make me laugh, entertain me,
do something to make me want to read your column. There's a time to
be serious and a time to poke fun at people and situations. Be
creative—Craig Neff’s “Point After” in this week’s SI is just some
great creative writing. Curry Kirkpatrick’s infamous ‘‘Me and my
very good friends” story during the NBA championships was pure
gold. Let’s see some more of this kind of writing.

Which brings me back to my original point about Mr. Chase. He ex-
periments. He is willing to take chances. He is, bottom line, fun to
read. That piece on his childhood friend breaking the 100-meter dash
world record? Great stuff. Surprising, isn’t it? Sometimes it’s not the
“big-time” sports writer but the guy in your own backyard that suc-
cessfully touches his readers. Writing a column (for me, at least) is
one of the more enjoyable aspects of working for a newspaper. It’s a
chance to be yourself. Mr. Chase is himself. Denlinger, Boswell,
What’shisname, Bill Lyons and Frank Dolson (of The Inquirer) just
don’t see to be as natural or as honest. Mr. Chase, I’m impressed.

NOTES—In last week’s Phi, men’s cross country runner Richard
Moore was reported to have the ‘‘shingles,” a virus that also is
associated with the chicken pox. Although Moore did have the virus,
The Phi’s story somewhat exaggerated the extent to which Moore con-
tracted the illness. Moore did not have the virus ‘‘break out all over”
his body but, instead, was infected only on a small area on his chest.
The Phi just wants to clarify the situation... William Perry does not
deserve to play in the NFL. He is overrated, fat and a disgrace to the
game of football. On Monday night, Perry maliciously pulled the
facemask of a Denver running back, spinning the player 180 degrees
and then giving an extra tug for good measure after the play was over.
Couple that with Perry’s body slam of Neil Lomax last season and you
have an extremely dangerous 300-pound plus person running loose in
the NFL...Another comment on the Perry incident. All three of ABC’s
broadcasters, Al Michaels, Frank Gifford and Dan Dierdorf, wimped
out. I expected at least one of them to come out and say that Perry
should have been ejected from the game. But, as usual, guts are not to
be found in that broadcasting booth...Congratulations to the W&L
water polo team forits great performance this season. The disappoin-
ting showing in the Eastern Championships should not mar what was
an exciting and spectacular fall...
