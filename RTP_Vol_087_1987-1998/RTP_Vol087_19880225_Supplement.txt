A Letter from the President...

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY
LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT

A Fancy Dress message from the President

Fancy Dress is both an event and a tradition at Washington and Lee.

The event itself has changed greatly over the years since it first occurred
back in 1907. Older alumni recall the elegant costumes, the formal "figures"
honoring the president of Fancy Dress and its other officers, old Doremus as
King Arthur's Court, Shakespeare's Globe Theater, the Emerald City of 0z, or
some other magical transformation. For other alumni, Fancy Dress evokes memories |
of a chandeliered ballroom in Evans Hall, with dancers in black tie instead of
rented costumes. For alumni of the 70's, Fancy Dress was 2,000 persons jampacked
into the University Center and Evans Hall for a thematic smorgasbord of musical
entertainment. In recent years, the variety of enjoyment has continued in
Fancy Dress's return to Doremus and the Warner Center.

The tradition that draws all of these differing memories together is a
simple one. Fancy Dress is always fun, always exciting, always worth the time,
effort and considerable expense that Washington and Lee students have devoted
to its creation over many decades.

Like all of the Fancy Dress weekends before, Fancy Dress for 1988 will
represent the best efforts of a relatively small number of energetic, creative
and dedicated persons to extend this grand social heritage for the enjoyment of
their fellow students, the faculty and staff, and the alumni of our University.
As we delight in what they have. accomplished we acknowl edge our gratitude for
their labors on our behalf.

For everyone attending Fancy Dress this year, I hope the evening is one
you will remember with pleasure all the rest of your life.

Ball of 1865 is

theme for 81st Fancy Dress

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

The theme for the 81st annual
Fancy Dress Ball is the Recon-
ciliation Ball of 1865.

Chosen for its historical signi-
ficance, the Reconciliation Ball
will showcase Civil War cos-
tumes and decorations from both
the north and the south including
buildings you might see in New
York and Philadelphia, southern
carriages and a gazebo.

The royal treatment will begin
as you and your date ascend the
red carpeted stairs outside of the
Warner Center flanked by

lighted trees. A 12 by 18 foot
American flag will drape down
over the top of the doorway.

The lobby of the Warner
Center will be decorated with
blown up posters and the front
pages of newspapers from the
time of the Civil War. A buggy,
papered in red, will sit off to the
side.

As you enter the big gym, the
Glenn Miller Ochestra will be
sitting at the far end of the gym.
Behind it will hang the 36 state
flags of the states that were
members of the union in 1865 on
a gray background with a blue
border. Across from that on the
wall with the stairs leading up
the 500 level of the Warner
Center will be a_ two-story

southern mansion complete with
columns and trees covered with
Spanish moss. :

On the Gilliam Dormitory side
of the gym will be a Northern
street scene with a Northern
Park and a couple of buildings
that you might have seen in
downtown New York, Boston,
or Philadelphia at the time of the
Civil War. In front of the scene
will be a cobblestone street with
street signs and lighted trees.

On the opposite wall will be a
Southern scene featuring a white
carriage, park benches and a
gazebo surrounded by dogwood
trees, azealas, and rose blos-
soms.

The little gym will be dec-
orated like a paddlewheel river-

boat. The wall closest to the Ath-
letic offices will be decorated
like a paddlewheel while porth-
oles and other nautical dec-
orations adorn the sides of the
gym. Marshall Crenshaw and
Indecision will be set on a stage
to the right of the hall entrance.

One of the most appealing
things about the Reconciliation
Ball of 1865 theme was the
possibility of bringing back the
wearing of costumes to the ball.
While this is an exciting and
creative element of Fancy Dress,
everyone must remember that
we at Washington and Lee are
expected to act like gentlemen,
and ladies, at all times. If wear-
ing a costume, use tasteful
judgement.

The Reconciliation Ball of
1865 is an exciting theme for
Washington and Lee. The Civil
War played not only a great part
in American history but in that
of Washington and Lee Univer-
sity as well. Robert E. Lee holds
a special place in the heart of
each student here and what bet- .
ter way to celebrate him, our
school, and the union of what
was our war-torn nation that at
the biggest collegiate social
event in the nation; our very own
Fancy Dress Ball.

Ladies and Gentlemen, Wel-
come to the Reconciliation Ball
of 1865, the 81st annual Fancy
Dress Ball at Washington and
Lee University. Let the fes-
tivities begin.

The Long and Winding Fancy Dress Road

By Marshall Boswell
Staff Reporter

 

The official date given for the
first Fancy Dress Ball is Febru-
ary 1907. That’s eighty-one
years ago, for those of you with-
out a calculator. But that’s not,
necessarily, eighty-one Fancy
Dress Balls. Indeed, the history
of our little winter term shindig
is rich with anecdote and cultural
signigicance.

It is appropriate that we look
back at the origins of Fancy
Dress on this, its eighty-first
birthday. Although the common
belief is that a one Miss Annie Jo

White started FD all those years
ago, actually the idea of a major
ball was brewing long before her
initial efforts.

The first reference to a
“Fancy Dress’’ anything was a
blurb in the September 27, 1876
issue of the Southern Collegian
concerning a ‘‘Fancy Dress
Hop.’’ For nearly a decade be-
fore that, however, students here
had been putting on dances and
hops—without sanction from the
university—in off-campus build-
ings, stables, or wherever a band
could set up and folks could cut a
rug or two. These hops met with
profound disapproval from cam-

pus authorities, but the kids kept
at it.

In December of 1871, the Col-
legian sent a reporter to W&L to
cover a hop put on by a myster-
ious group of men calling them-
selves, appropriately enough,
the ‘‘Student Social Club.’’ The
reporter described the men as.
“‘elegantly dressed,’’ while the
women these fellows were lucky
enough to be escorting were

dubbed ‘‘simply bewitching.”’ |

‘‘The Fancy Dress Hop’’ that
followed several years later was
called a ‘‘great success’’ by the
Collegian and this inspired a ser-
ies of similar endeavors, the
most creative of which was the
*‘Finals Ball’’ held during exam
week of 1879. The Collegian re-
porter complained that this par-
ticular dance was simply too
short: it ended at 3 a.m..

Public sentiment was in vio-
lent opposition to this new inter-
est in balls and hops. |.
Protestant churches and trustees
rose up in anger against this ‘‘li-
centious”’ flurry of activity. One
fellow, observing the 1879
commencement exercises, said
he ‘feared the passing of old
times.”’ ,He went on to say,
‘What would ‘Stonewall’ Jack-
son think of the youth in Lexing-
ton dancing to the licentious
german or disgusting racket?’
Lastly, he worried that the girls
were doing simply to much hug-
ging.

Even the Gazette concurred,
writing ‘*The time has come for
the public sentiment of the
Christian people of Lexington to
discountenence the lascivious
dancing which we are sorry to
say is being introduced here.”’

But local satirist *“G. Whili-
kins, fought back with these
wise words: ‘‘As long as there is
music and young folks, it will git

(sic) into their toes... Girls like to

be hugged, and the boys like to
hug them. The question is
whether it is better to do it in the
ballroom or behind the door.”’

The first real Fancy Dress Ball
came a decade later. The
school’s then-current librarian,
Miss Annie Jo White, enter-
tained a group of her student
friends witha costume party one
February evening in 1907. Be-
cause she felt that the students
needed something to spark up
the mid-winter dullness, she
sought to make the affair an an-
nual event.

A Fancy Dress from years past.

It took some doing, but she
eventually rustled up enough
student enthusiasm to make the
Fancy Dress Ball one of the
highlights of the W&L social
calendar. Miss White was the
undisputed Queen of Fancy
Dress for 13 years, and in later
years was even paid $50 for her
services.

It was after her death in 1922,
however, that the Fancy Dress
Ball really took off. By 1928,
The New York Times described it
as ‘‘the South’s outstanding col-

legiate social event,’’ even

though that ball was something
entirely different from the event
we celebrate now. For starters,
it was a costume ball, elaborate
and glittering, with exotic
European themes setting the
pace. Famous big bands frequen-
ted the ball, and the music was
routinely broadcast on network
radio hook-ups all over the
nation. Fancy Dress, it has been

observed, began the same year

Henry Ford was working on the

first Model T: It was the quites-
sence of the Edwardian Age.

Fancy Dress was elaborate,

 

aristocratic, imaginitive, and
even perhaps snobbish. But it
was born out of an earnest desire
to create a wonderland here on
campus, and more often than
not, succeeded.

There were no Fancy Dress
Balls during the. second World
War, and the tradition didn’t
quite survive the turbulent Six-
ties, but through it all, Fancy
Dress just seems to keep crop-
ping up every winter. Like a
breath of fresh air.

Off to the ballroom, ladies and
gentlemen.

Fancy Dress, one of the
nation’s largest parties, a time
for great bands and people, is
also the right time to go out and
enjoy a good meal with a date.
Or, for those who dare venture
to Fancy Dress without a date,
good friends.

Towards this end, the sou-
thwest region of Virginia can
more than adequately cater to
such dining needs. Tucked away
in Charlottesville, Staunton,
Lexington, Lynchburg and
Roanoke are some great dining
establishments.

In this articles I have tried to
put together a list of some of
these places with a brief descrip-
tion and essential details for
each. I can not claim to have ea-
ten at all the restaurants (or even
one-third of them, for that mat-
ter) but the restaurants listed
have good reputations or have
otherwise been recommended to
me. In most cases a call to the
maitre d’ was necessary.

At this point, I must admit that
after re-reading the descriptions,
this may not be a fair article. The
descriptions may appear that I
am trying to head you to a parti-
cular restaurant.

I must also admit that I do
have a personal favorite, the
White Star Mill, but please don’t
let the sound or size of a descrip-
tion discourage you—I don’t
think you can go wrong with any
of them.

Personally, I am off to the
Green Briar, West Virginia (and
yes it should be wild, and yet at
the same time, sort of wonder-
ful). I hope to give you all the
full report in the next issue of
The Ring-tum Phi.

In any case, whether you
choose a restaurant from this list
or dine at your own favorite, eat
well and with a group of friends
for ‘‘good dining company
makes for better din-
ing’’—wherever. And _ please,
don’t ruin the weekend for your
family and friends by overin-
dulging and driving. Obey the
rules of the road and use com-
mon sense. I hope this list proves
helpful in making your Fancy
Dress Weekend successful.

Located in a posh region of
Albemarle County, the Boar's

and a restaurant. Though the
menu lacks international flare
they do serve duck. The glory of
the Boar’s Inn is solid American
cuisine prepared impeccably.
Prices of entrees range from
$12.25 to $18. A full bar with a

good selection of wines will ac-
company a meal nicely. Re-
servations and jackets for men
are required.

The Ivy Inn, 2244 Old Ivy
Road (across from Ivy gar-
dens—one mile from University
of Virginia), 977- 1222.

Dine by candle-light in this
restored large house, built circa
1803. The menu at the Ivy Inn
varies greatly, including
chicken, beef, veal, and lamb.
Prices range from $10.50 to
$14.00. Despite the romantic
atmosphere, Mrs. Abbot, the
proprietor, permits a “‘just be
comfortable”’ style of dress, but
she would appreciate re-
servations. All spirits are ser
ved.

The C&O Restaurant, 515 E.
Water, 971- 7044.

This may be one of Char-
lottesville’s, and southwest Vir-
ginia’s, most enjoyable and
unique restaurants. At the C&O
Restaurant, the emphasis of the
dining experience is on the food
(‘the focus of the senses’’) and
as such the formal dining room
(coat and tie required) is dec

orated all white--white linen,
white walls and white floors.
The French cuisine is served a la
carte but unlike European res-
taurants the portions are large.
Don’t pass up the opportunity to
enjoy your meal with a bottle of
wine from the C&O’s extensive
wine cellar which has been voted
one of the top 100 in the nation
by Wine Spectatormagazine. En-
tree prices range from $18.25 to
$25. Bill Hubert, the manager,
says that the experience is
unique but honestly admits that
you may love it or hate it. There
are two seatings for dinner, the
first at 6:30 and the second at
9:30.

Staunton

Buckhorn Inn, 12 miles west of

Staunton, Route 250 W. Church-
ville, 337-6900.

The Buckhorn Inn is a very
casual restaurant serving a $9.50
seafood buffet on Friday. Enjoy
beer, wine and a lot to eat be-
tween the hours of 4:00 and
9:00. Reservations are not
necessary but you may want to
call ahead just to be sure.

The Belle Grae Inn, 515 W.
Frederick St. (Downtown),
886-5151.

The Belle Grae Inn has a bis-
tro serving an a la carte menu
and a dining room located in the
old inn. Dinner varies from
night to night according to the
chef's choices. Each night there
is a choice of three different
meals which include appetizer,
soup, entree and dessert for the
set price of $20. A full bar will
add an additional price per
drink. Dress is optional and re-
servations are not required
though it may be well advised to
call ahead to check on the crowd
and menu.

The White Star Mill,
St. , 885- 3409.

Truly one of the finer estab-
lishments around. The White
Star Mill is not cheap but is de-
finitely worth it for the tremen-
dous variety of dishes. Appe-
tizers range from escargot to a
variety of soups. Desserts are a
la carte and plentiful but the en-
trees are the bill of the day

impeccable detail and taste. An
evening at the White Star Mill
for two, including a few indul-
gences into the full bar, will run
around $80 to $100 but, oh boy,
it’s well worth the expense if you
can afford it.

Lexington

The Willson-Walker House, 30
N. Main St. , 463- 3020.

The Willson-Walker House is
similar to old inn dining. There
are several rooms which add to
its coziness and eliminates much
of the hustle and bustle of large
one-room restaurants. Cocktails,
beer and wine will complement
your meal. The menu is strong
with beef, seafood and chicken
dishes. Entrees are prepared a
variety of different ways, includ-
ing Southern American. The lo-
cation is a plus and convenience
in choosing the restaurant for it
is walking distance from most
parts of town. Prices range from
around $8 to about $15. Re-
servations are a must during
Fancy Dress and coat and tie are
recommended.

Fancy Dress—a fairy tale
night. The full moon gazes be-

commence an endless evening of
fantasy. Perfumed, made-up and

So I started to think what I
could say about the renowned
Fancy Dress Ball. The first ob-
vious thing to do was to go back
to that blurry five day weekend
and try to scrape up some data
on the event. But as I began to
think, I realized that it was just
that...blurry! Surely it must have

meant something to me
though...I don’t know—have
some relevance.

Well I'll tell you what *‘was”’
relevant, at least at the time. I
lost my bow tie, I got hollan-
daise all over my lapel, my
roommate lost the tap for the
after-party, I never saw my girl-
friend again, and I didn’t even
get to see Asha the elephant!
You say, ‘wait a minute, did I
just hear something about your
girlfriend in between the tap and
the elephant?’’ I know it sounds

holds me, and almost shyly,
hands me red roses.

We rush off, arm in arm, to
the chariot waiting outside,
which wisks us away to an inti-
mate restaurant. We sit in a cor-
ner, the shadows cast by flicker-
ing candles playing hide and
seek around our faces. For once
in my life I don’t worry about
getting food caught in my teeth
or using the wrong fork—no, to-
night is perfect. Our words, our
actions, the night itself is en-
chanted; nothing can or will go
wrong.

my god-like escort leads me on
his arm to the ball itself. What

probably thinking that my FD
stunk. That’s what I was think-
ing too for a while, but when it
was over I realized that in fact, I
had had a blast.

Anyway here we are. It’s Fri-
day night, the Ball is near and
my girlfriend and I have just had
another big blow out. What per-
fect timing, I remember thinking
as we walked toward Doremus.
After all this is FD and certainly
no time to be in a fight with your
girlfriend. The night was cool
and clear though and at least I
thought something was on my
side. The sky, deep and almost
purple, was a warm welcome
from the cold shoulder I was re-
ceiving from my girlfriend.~
Sounds corny, but as the sweep-
ing spot lights began to lure us in
and as we walked closer and
closer, we began to forget about
the fights and the stupid little
things. It was as if the excite-
ment of FD was taking over as
our minds began to drift toward
and ponder the events soon to
appear.

The interior amazed us: a gym

gracefully, our feet hidden by
magically misty air, the other
couples turn to stare. Never have
any two people seemed more
like one, gliding across the floor
in perfect rhythm, laughing
gaily. The soft lights in the room
follow us around as though at-
tracted magnetically. He leans
and whispers softly into my ear,
and I arch my neck back and
smile into those watery pods of
his eyes which reflect my happi-
ness.

I wake from my dream with a
sigh. My date doesn’t have to be
an Adonis, and the chariot can
be a beat-up Ford. I just hope I
get a date.

Frank Sinatra tune, the dimmed
lights, the scent of the tropical
leaves. I don’t know, it all kind
of gave me a feeling of impor-
tance, like we had finally surpas-
sed those awkward high school
dances and had finally reached
something of significance and
something most importantly to
remember.

Those magical hours in the
Dark Continent began to erase
the reality behind us. We even
began to laugh as we forgot what
exactly it was those fights were
all about! That is what Fancy
Dress is to me: A time to step
outside of reality and enter an
imaginative world where things
like next week’s tests are insigni-
ficant and the only important
thing is that moment.

Fancy Dress probably means a
lot of different things to different
people. To some it might just be
a good time. To others though, it
might mean something more,
perhaps tradition or nostalgia.
For me at least, Fancy Dress has
the magical ability to transport
me back to a time where yester-

day and tomorrow mean nothing
and today, means all.

The South’s Greatest Party, an

fabled tales of conquest and fai-

of these images accumulated
over the last six months create

The thing I remember most
about last year’s Fancy Dress is
that I got caught as soon as I
walked into the gym. I wasn’t
really doing anything wrong, of
course, but a friend of mine who
was working security really
wanted to get one of those little
bracelets on my wrist.

I didn’t even want to drink at
Fancy Dress. A freshman would
have been so out of place among
all the seniors and juniors on the
balcony where alcohol was being
served. But I got snagged any-
way. The night was off to a great

Truly a grandeose event, FD
is all you make of it. The poten-

is only a question of how your
luck holds and what your attitude
is going in. So, after milking as
much attention as is humanly
possible in deciding who
“receives your bid,’’ by all
means dive right in. Folks,
Fancy Dress is a happenin’

consciousness sometime Thurs-

on Sunday with no clue as to
how your weekend went, but sat-

that gym. The bands were terri-
fic, although it is rather embar-
rassing to be dancing in a long
dress to the sounds of the Hoo-
doo Gurus while your politics
professor is looking on.

The most impressive thing
about the ball is its impact on

‘this university. It is one of the

great W&L traditions. It is also
the cause for much anxiety about
dates, clothes, dinner plans, and
such. For some, the arrival of
Fancy Dress weekend is festive
and exciting, for some it is
stressful. Thoughts of Fancy
Dress elicited a strange and wide
variety of reactions from the
girls on my hall, everything
from elation to depression to
feigned indifference. But the fact
is that no one can be indifferent
to Fancy Dress— it is the light at
the end of a long, dark Winter
term tunnel.

I think of more than just a great

Thursday night concert always
promises to feature a hot rock
band. Yes, the ball is always a
new, unforgettable spectacle of
extravagance. And Yes, the par-
ties are ‘‘raging‘* non-stop.

But more important than all of
this, Fancy Dress creates smiles
that are real, transforming some
of the hardest hit winter
scrooges into fun-loving spring
bees.

Have you suddenly noticed
many more women showing up
at your fraternity parties? Even
Graham-Lees has been taken
over by the surrounding
women’s colleges. This is only
because the Fancy Dress season
is approaching, and although
many girls refuse to admit it,
they hope to be asked. As soon
as one girl is invited she be-
comes the envy of others. In
many ways F.D. weekend is
much dreaded. Perhaps this is
because many feel it is an honor
to be a part of Fancy Dress. I
tend to agree, simply because

F.D. is not only a well-known
event in Virginia, but also in
other surrounding areas. Even in
my home state of New York,
people have either heard of or at-
tended the Fancy Dress Ball.

All in all, Fancy Dress is the
BIG DEAL that people seem to
make it. Never have I seen such
a motivated and organized group |
of students so dedicated to make
a school function such a success.
Fancy Dress is not merely for
the students, but also faculty,
alumni, and even parents. It is
probably the most festive social
function that can brighten up the
winter months. What does F.D.
entail? A four-day party that is
definitely worth the exhaustion.
If you are at all hesitant about
Fancy Dress, don’t be! Give it a
chance; it is a weekend you will
remember.

got one whole day to get ready.

My dream date.

FANCY DRESS— two of the
most popular words that a Wash-
ington and Lee student can utter.
The thought alone brings to
mind some of the most cherished
memories I possess. This is,
without a doubt, the most festive
activity on the school calendar.
In case you have not experienced
Fancy Dress before, or if you
are considering leaving for the
weekend because you cannot
find the right date, please allow
me two minutes of your time.

Make any necessary arrange-
ments to be in Lexington, Vir-
ginia between the second and the
sixth of March, 1988, for these
days will provide you with some
of the best fun and festivities that
you will experience anywhere,
anytime. But before this time ar-
rives, you have one task— that
of finding one individual with
whom to share in the grand
splendor of this eagerly awaited

to...What?...Oh, you do...O.K.
sure, no problem—No, I really
wasn’t hungry anyway... Sure,
well, I—I guess you can pick me
up later then... What? Oh, yeah,
I suppose I could meet you there
if you’d rather. But, how will I
fing you im ail the
crowd?...0.K. sure. I guess it
doesn’t matter...(pause) Oh, by
the way, what’s the deal about
tomorrow? You know, I’ve al-
ways thought Fancy Dress Sat-
urday is more fun than the ball
itself. Isn’t there a big party at
your house tomorrow afternoon
with that band from Georgia? I
heard some people talking about
it and they said they were fantas-
tic! I can’t wait to see... What?
Oh, really...I guess not... That’s
O.K....No, actually I was prob-

woman from one of the neigh-
boring colleges who would gla-
dly give away her Daddy’s
BMW to have **THE BID‘ ex-
tended her way. If you are a girl,
blow some guy’s mind and ask
him. Whatever you do, just be
there.

The festivities will begin
around Wednesday and run non-
stop through the weekend. Peo-
ple will congregate at the Pit, at
the new Student Activities Pavi-
lion (for a top-name band, we
hope), at the Warner Center for
the ball itself, and at every loca-
tion of campus organization for
parties of every sort. The Fancy
Dress experience, I dare say,
will not let you down. As a
senior staring graduation in the
face, I realize that there are in-
numerable things that I will sin-
cerely miss about my undergra-
duate years. Fancy Dress is right
event. If you are a guy and need
a date, check out The Palms any
night before March |, or better
yet, just be seen in public and
you are bound to find some

ably going to do something else
anyway...(pause) Well, do you
think you’ll be free by Saturday
night for the..no, I didn’t think
so...Yeah, I know what you
mean— I hate fighting the
crowds too. (pause) Well, I also
heard about a small group going
up to the parkway on Sunday if
you’d like to go and we
could...Yeah, I have to study
too...(pause) Well, I...I guess
I’ll meet you at the ball later to-
night then...O.K.— talk to you
soon. Thanks for calling. Bye.’’

“‘Liz, who was. that on the
phone?”’

**Oh, It was my date calling to
work out the details for the
weekend. He’s such an awesome
guy—I’m really excited! It’s go-
ing to be a greatweekend!””

around the top of the list. It is the
most eagerly awaited weekend
of the year, as people arrive
from all over the nation simply
to experience this colossal occa-
sion.

Quite frankly, I cannot think
of a better way to spend four or
five days and nights. One of the
best and most unique qualities
about W&L is the personable
nature of our community. Fancy
Dress is the perfect personifica-
tion of this characteristic. It
brings together everyone who
has any tie with the University
for quality celebrating. For just a
while, the cliques and the bar-
riers of our social lives are
stripped away so that we can all
enjoy time together, an other-
wise nonexistent condition. I
hope everyone can come away
from Fancy Dress with the same
satisfaction that I have been able
to enjoy. Grab a date, call some
friends from home, and be sure
to find yourself in Lexington in
early March; for a better time
cannot be found.

Love Tractor & Marshall Crenshaw headline FD

 

By Greg Unger
Music Critic

 

Chalk Fancy Dress 1988 up as
one that almost was, in a sense.
We almost got either Echo and
The Bunnymen, Guadalcanal
Diary, or (as it was rumored)
INXS. The Bands that the
SAB were able to procure for
our listening pleasure this
Thursday and Friday night lack
the general exposure of the big
name groups, yet possess much
of the same musical intensity,
inspired lyrics, and professional
delivery of their more well
known counterparts. As every
one doesn’t realize, it isn’t all
that easy to get the superstars,
they have to be touring this area
at the time. Lucky for us that
Love Tractor, Drivin’ N Cryin’,
and Pinocchio’s Nose stepped in
to fill the void on Thursday and
Marshall Crenshaw appears on
Friday.

Love Tractor continues to be a
major factor in the college music
scene and at Washington and
Lee in particular. The Athens
Ga. quartet of Michael Rich-
mond (guitar, vocals), Ar-
mistead Wellford (bass, vocals),
Andrew Carter (drums) and
Mark Cline on guitars are per-
ennial Van Riper’s favorites who
have garnered much playing
time in the Virginia area at selec-
ted college campuses. Coming
off their hugely successful album
This ain't No Outerspaceship,
they bring to W&L a fervently
acoustic band, ‘‘Rolling more
than rocking through instrumen-
tal layering and rich textures’’.
We can expect a vocally accen-
tuated effort from a group who

 

Marshall Crenshaw

are confident enough in them-
selves to give us just
that—themselves—without _ hid-
ing behind the glitz of theatrics
and garbled machinery of synth-
esizers.

Love Tractor emerged out of

the trendy ‘‘Southern guitar re-
vival Americana crap’’ (ca.
1980) as a force to be reckoned
with on the new music scene.

great kick-off to your F.D.
weekend.

Drivin’ N Cryin’, you may
remember, was phenomenally
popular up at WLUR about this
time last year--and with good
reason. The Atlanta trio has only
been playing as a group for a
little over two years now, but
they have the poise and charisma
coupled with the fundamental
capability to rock that distingui-
shes them from the veritable
plethora of imposters. Believe it
or not, they combine punk,
country, and acoustic material to
form their own unique sound,
epitomized on their highly ac-
claimed Ip, Scarred But Smar-
ter. Many of the tracks mirror
the band’s ‘‘affinity for banging
out hard driving rock’n’roll with
unyielding energy and punk in-
tensity’. ‘‘Scarred But Smar-
ter’, ‘Another Scarlet Butterf-
ly’’, and ‘‘Count the Flowers’

 

are songs that you've heard be-
fore.

Pinocchio’s Nose opens the
concert Thursday night at the
pavilion. Never heard of them?
Neither have I, except recently
when somebody somewhere told
me that they were a good band.
What the hell, start your night
early and get up there and give
these guys a_ chance--you’ll
probably be ecstatic that you did.
Tickets for the entire show are
only $5.00 per couple, and doors
open at 8 p.m..

Kevin Kinney is chief song-
writer, backed up by Tim Porter
(of Nightporter fame), and Jeff
Sullivan on drums. They bring
their show on the road following
the release of their latest Ip in
January. ‘‘Together the mem-
bers of Drivin’ N “Cryin have
created a sound, filled with

warmth and sincerity encapsuled
in blazing guitars, that has won
them loyal fans around the coun-
try’’. When they roll into Lex-
ington Thursday night, they
should feel right at home.

Marshall Howard Crenshaw is
the featured attraction Friday
night at the 1988 Fancy Dress
Ball. He was born in Detroit,
Michigan on November 11,
1953. He is married, is 5°9‘‘,
137 lbs., has brown hair, green
eyes, and his favorite color is
blue. If these colors don’t seem
right to you, don’t adjust your
set, but turn up the volume.
Marshall plays some pretty good
music.

His latest effort, Mary Jean
and 9 Others, produced by Don
Dixon is no exception to that
rule. He just earned a platinum
single in Britain for ‘‘Favorite

, | Fancy Dress Supplement, February 25, 1988, Page 9

Waste of Time’’, worked on the
movie Peggy Sue Got Married,
and starred as Buddy Holly in
the hit movie La Bamba. So, he
is a consummate entertainer as
well as a proven performer. Be-
sides, my twin brother Eric likes
him a lot I think. Past Ip’s in-
clude Marshall Crenshaw, Field
Day, and Downtown.

Marshall's favorite foods are
fried fish, sushi, and pizza. He
has a dog named Fredrod, a rab-
bit named Shep, and he likes the
smell of gasoline and Jason
Faust when he hasn't showered
in 4 days. Oh yeah, he doesn’t
like cheap disgusting food or TV
preachers, so Jimmy Swaggart
you sex-crazed devil worshipper
you, had better stay out of town.
As for the W&L community ,

this Fancy Dress Ball should be
a great one—hope to see you
there.

Some things never change and
just get better with age.

A legend Lives on as the Glenn
Miller Orchestra swings into
Lexington to set the mood for
Fancy Dress

Glenn Miller launched the
band that lives today in 1938,
becoming one of the most suc
cessful dance bandleaders in th
Swing era of the 1930's and
40’s. A matchless string of hit

records, the impact of radio
broadcasts and the drawing
power at theaters, hotels and
dance pavilions built and sus
tained the momentum of popu-
larity.

At the height of popularity
Miller disbanded his musical or-
ganization in 1942 to volunteer
for the army. He went on to
form the Army Air Force Band
playing all over Europe for the
G.I.’s. On December 15, 1944
Major Miller took off in a
single- engine plane from Eng-
land to precede his band to
France and was never seen
again. The Army declared him
dead a year later.

Popular demand urged the
Miller Estate to form the present
Glenn Miller Orchestra in 1956
under the direction of drummer
Ray McKinley.

The current 19-member band
consisting of the leader, five
saxophone players, four trum-
peters, four trombonists, three
rhythm musicians and two vocal-
ists, continues to play many of
the original Miller arrange-
ments. The band is also playing
more modern selections in the
big-band style, carefully select-
ing those newer tunes that lend
themselves to the Miller sound.
The male and female singers
perform both individually and as
part of the Moonlight Serenaders
vocal group. The entire reper-
toire now exceeds 1700 compo-
sitions and keeps the band popu-
lar with young and old audien-
ces.

The Glenn Miller Orchestra
has always been very musical
and visually entertaining, main-
taining its own distinctive sound.

That sound is created by the
clarinet holding the melodic line,
doubled or coupled with the
tenor sax playing the same notes
and the harmonies produced by
three other saxaphones, while
growling trombones and wailing
trumpets add their ooh-ahs.

The band and the sound have
staying power, the popularity
never seeming to wane, and just
like the tradition of Fancy Dress,
the Miller sound lives forever.

Don‘ let your ‘glasses blur
your vision.

   

Whether a glass holds 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1'/ ounces of spirits, the alcohol
content is the same. It’s important to know this because the size and shape of the glass can give
people a distorted impression of how much alcohol they’re actually drinking.

So when you're out to share some cheer with friends, remember how much alcohol is in your
glass and that drinking sensibly lets you hold things in focus.

Always keep safe driving within your sight.

Lexington, 463- 4666.

Maple Hall is a beautiful large
country home converted into a
restaurant. There are several
small dining rooms decorated in
impeccable colonial taste. Maple
Hall does have a private room
reserved for larger parties. The
menu will vary from day to day
but a patron can always count on
high quality service and fine
country dining. Again the con-
venience of dining in the Lexing-
ton area is obvious. Reservations
are appreciated and coat and tie

Center, Route 501 North,
384-3311.

Don’t let Emil’s location fool
you or deter you—this place is
wonderful—probably as many
Sweet Briar girls can attest.
Emil’s serves lunch and dinner
in its two dining rooms. The
menu is varied and enticing. Li-
quor, beer and wine are served.
Dinner prices of entrees start at
around $8, the average being
about $12. Dress for dinner is
semi-formal to formal and re-
servations are recommended.

Sachiko’s International Res-
taurant, 126 Old Grave Mill

   

Road, 237-5655.

Beef, seafood, veal, lamb and
chicken dishes all prepared in a
great variety of international
styles will certainly satisfy a
number of different tastes.
Prices range from $9.50 to
$21.95 and a full complement of
spirits will help carry the even-
ing. Sachiko’s is an elegant res-
taurant and requires coat and tie

_ as well as reservations.

The Bank, 1030 Main St. (11th
and Main), 847- 8100.

The structural beauty of The
Bank will enhance a meal of
authentic French cuisine. Ori-
ginally built in 1914 as a bank,

the owner of the restaurant has’

since spent over one million dol-
lars converting the building into

   
    

a three-story restaurant. The
third floor serves as a formal
dining room complete with fire-
place and 40-foot ceilings accen-
tuated with decorative gold leaf.
Meals are made-to-order and the
menu may vary somewhat ac-
cording to deliveries made four
times weekly. Prices are very
reasonable starting at $8.50. The
owner and chef assure that you
will never feel out of place in
black tie for many patrons are
fully decked out. Though re-
servations are suggested a week
in advance, it would behoove
you to call anyway.

Fraternities ready for Saturday

 

By Greg Ossi
Staff Reporter

 

Traditions run deep at Wash-
ington and Lee and one of our
more festive ones is the big bash
of Fancy Dress.

Fraternities play a big part in
this occasion usually having
several parties of their own. The
fun usually starts Friday after-
noon with some sort of cocktail
or imported beer party. Then
there is the ball. Afterwards it
may be back to the house for a
champagne party.

Saturday afternoon is still
rocking with cocktail parties and
bands keeping things live. Sat-
urday night sees another band.
Most of these parties are closed

The Policeman

 

By Joel Miller
Staff Reporter

 

The Lexington Police De-
partment intends to crack down
on Washington and Lee Univer-
sity students who are driving
drunk during their annual Fancy
Dress Weekend (March 3-5),
according to a police official.

Police Lt. Steven E. Crowder
said extra officers will be pa-
trolling the Lexington area
throughout the weekend.

‘“‘We plan to concentrate
mainly on disorderly people be-
cause they are usually the ones
invoved in drunk-driving acci-
dents,’’ he said. ‘‘We also will
be concentrating on people who
are drunk in public,’’ he added.

Crowder said that student
arrest rates have been on the de-
crease in past years because of

is your

 

Virginia’s stricter drunk- driving
\aws. He said that students who
intend to drink should ask a
friend who will be sober to drive
them to and from the Fancy
Dress Ball itself and from the
various parties around the cam-
pus.

He added that the officers are
not instructed to be unduly harsh
when dealing with students.
‘‘We are strictly told to treat
them fairly and to assist them in
any way we can,”” he said.

And don’t be afraid to ask a
police officer to drive you home.
Crowder said he could recall
some instances when ‘“‘some
students were ‘taxied’ home by
an officer because they asked
and they were so drunk they
could hardly stand up to save
their lives,’’ which if you think
about it, is exactly what the
police officer did.

 

Your friend will be driving this.

With Fancy Dress rapidly ap-
proaching W&L security is look-
ing forward to an uneventful
weekend. As they prepare for
the ball, so can the student.

From past experience, the two
biggest security problems have
been lost coats and parking. Be-
cause coat checking is student
run there is only so much secur-
ity can do to help. The problem
with parking is not that there
isn’t any, but rather everyone
wants to park next to the gym
which is impossible. An alter-
nate nearby spot which will be lit
is the old freshman parking lot
on the other side of Route 60.

   

WA&L Security says parking will be a problem at the ball.

Burr Datz also suggested that

plan to drink. He stressed this
not only for the student’s per-

who will be with them. He also
reminded that the Lexington

He also reminded that the dec-

d Answers with

Fancy Dress Chairman Tom O’Brien

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

1. How did you get to be the
Chairman of Fancy Dress?

The Chairman of Fancy Dress
is a position that is appointed by
the Executive Committee. The
outgoing SAB Board of Direc-
tors also makes its recom-
mendations to the E.C. After all
factors and candidates are re-
viewed, a Chairman is chosen.

 

Tom O’Brien

2. What are your actual re-
sponsibilities as Fancy Dress
Chairman?

My responsibilities include
planning the budget, ordering
the materials, planning the room
designs and decorations and per-
haps the most tasking job of all,

 

Love Tractor rolls into Lexington

 

x

managing a group of 100 SAB
members. Above all else, I am
responsible for ensuring that the
Student Body enjoy themselves
at the Ball.

3. How much money is being
spent on this year’s ball?

Our budget based on projected
costs is $68,000.

4. How many hours of work
from how many people will go
in to this year’s ball?

Each SAB member will be ex-
pected to work at least 20 hours
in preparation for Fancy Dress.
The SAB board of directors have
already put in countless hours.

5. How difficult was it to get
the bands hired for FD?

It was very difficult because
no one would commit to coming.
We had bids in on 10,000
Maniacs, Echo & the Bunny-
men, and lots of others but they
wouldn’t commit. We almost
had Guadalcanal Diary but they
canceled too. If a band is not
already playing in this area it’s
tough to get them to come. We
did the best we could.

6. Was it especially hard to
get Glenn Miller?

No, because we planned way
in advance. Swing bands are ea-
sier to get because they don’t
have the travel schedule that a

rock band does.
7. What will be different
about this year’s ball?
Themewise, the ball is

centered in the United States in a
particular era and place unlike
themes of the recent past. The
theme also takes place in a his-
torical part of the country.

8. How did you come up with
the theme?

This year’s theme was chosen
because of its many possibilities

ioe

ie ;
ie

a

ee

and its ties to W&L history. We
figured that the Student Body
would enjoy this type of theme.
THE RECONCILIATION
BALL was chosen because of
the possibility of bringing back
the tradition of costumes. The
SAB wants this theme to bring
people together and to eliminate
any regional or racial conflicts
which marred the civil war
years.

9. What were some of the
other suggestions?

Many good suggestions were
presented to the SAB. Several
ideas revolved around the
1920's, including ‘‘Prohibition’’
and ‘‘Casino’’ or ‘‘Monte
Carlo.’’ ‘‘Down Under in Aus-
trailia’’ was popular but we wan-
ted to stay away from the place-
oriented themes of the past three
years. ‘‘Playboy Mansion’’ and
*‘Disneyland’’ were a couple
other suggestions.

10. Who came up with the
decoration ideas?

The decoration ideas were
formulated by Liz Smith, Lucy
Anderson and myself although
we did have many good sugges-
tions from other people. We
spent many hours of careful
preparation to come up with the
best decorations for the best
price.

11. Where does the money
for the ball come from?

Fancy Dress pays for itself
through ticket and concession
sales. We budget a set amount
based on what we can expect to
bring in by way of receipts. SAB
money, which is budgeted by the
E.C., is not used for Fancy
Dress.

12. What is the most exciting
thing about this year’s ball?

The revival of the costumes
and the relevance of the theme to
Washington and Lee history.

13. Any animals this year?

No. This year we decided that
animals weren't a visible and
necessary element for the theme,
as they were for last year’s THE
DARK CONTINENT. Our vis-
ual effects this year will be the
carriages and gazebo.

14. Has the administration
raised any questions concern-
ing the theme?

Yes, a few questions have
been raised about the nature of
the theme but we explained to
the administration that the theme
was chosen because of its histor-
ical relevance and significance to
Washington and Lee and not be-
cause of any racial or ethnic fac-
tor. Several members of the ad-
ministration expressed their
concerns about the theme being
potentially explosive racially and
politically. We maintain that
Fancy Dress is a social event and
not a political one. Our largest
concern is that everyone have a
happy, safe and memorable
Fancy Dress.

15. How long will the ball
last?

8:30 p.m. - 1 a.m.

16. When did you start
planning the ball?

Preliminary planning for the
ball began back in October, alth-
ough we didn’t finalize the
theme until early in January.
Certian basic decorations can
apply to all themes, but the
majority were ordered in Jan-
uary.

17. Will we be having a fire-
works display this year?

Yes, we're bringing back
fireworks. If the weather is

good, they will be shot from the
track at Wilson Field. If the
weather is poor they will be shot
from the field at the law school.
This year there will be two
shows. A small show will kick
off the ball around 8:30, and
then a much larger show will go
off later that evening after the
ball.

18. Where will everything be
located at the ball?

The layout will be basically
the same as it has been in years
past. The swing band will be in
the Warner Center and the rock
bands will be in Doremus.

19. What’s been the hardest

thing about managing Fancy
Dress?

The hardest thing has been
ironing out the fine details to
make sure everything goes
smoothly, so that both students
and administrators understand
the theme and are in no way
offended. The most important
thing is ensuring that everyone
has a good time.

20. What’s the one thing you
want the W&L community to
know about this year’s Fancy
Dress Ball?

The most important thing for
people to remember is that
Fancy Dress is a social event,
not a political one. This year’s
theme was chosen because of its
historical signigicance; especial-
ly here at W&L with Robert E.
Lee playing such an integral part
in the Civil War. The SAB’s
goal is to foster a feeling of
unity, hence, THE RECON-
CILIATION BALL and not to
amplify any regional or ethnic
conflicts. In essence, we hope
that everyone will have a happy
and memorable Fancy Dress.

 

 

Love Tractor from Athens, Ga. will headline Thursday nights show.

Words in Edgewise

 

In Search Of...the Fancy Dress Experience

 

By Marshall Boswell
Staff Reporter

 

Some stories just seem to stick
in your head. Here’s one of
mine, for instance.

When I was about ten-years-
old, a friend of mine got a brand
new bike. Beautiful. This was
before the day of BMX, knobby-
tired racing vehicles; no, my
friend’s bicycle was a sleek,
gorgeous Schwinn Sting
Ray—blue with a cream-colored
‘“‘banana’’ seat and high sissy
bar. It looked just like the
coolest, motorless chopper my
ten year old imagination could
have dreamt up. I longed to take
it out for a ride, give it a wheely
test, try it out on one of my
homemade ramps. So I tried out
the sure-fire euphamism every
ten-year-old kid employs in des-
perate times like these: ‘‘Hey,
think I can see it for a second?”’
See it, hell: I wanted to fly to
heaven on it.

But my friend would have
nothing doing. ‘‘It’s my new
bike and my dad said no one else
but me can ride it.’’ Oh, horror.
His dad.

 

 

So, instead he took me around
the neighborhood by letting me
balance my ten-year-old frame
on the brand new chrome handle
bars. It was dangerous, sure, but
when you’re ten, it’s only fun if
there’s threat of bodily injury.
And I'll never forget what he
said to me:

**Hey, Marshall. Try not to
bend the handle bars.’’ What did
he want me to do? Try to be
lighter? Concentrate on not
bending his handle bars while I
was sitting pecariously on them?
The whole matter was absurd:
either they were going to bend or
they were not. I couldn’t very
well force the issue.

I think of this story everytime
someone says to me, ‘‘Hey, try
not to think about how cold it
is.”’ But it is cold! Or: ‘‘Don’t
catch a cold.”’ It’s crazy.

Or how about this one: ‘‘Just
try and have a good time.”’
There is no logic in the statement
whatsoever. If someone has to
remind me to have a good time,
then it is obvious that for some
reason I am not enjoying myself.
And if I do end up having a good

time, it will be precisly because I
stopped tryingto do anything,
but instead just gave in to what
was going on.

I've filled two screens on my
word processor and still haven't
gotton to the point of this piece,
and I apologize. Anyway, at
long last, here it is: at Fancy
Dress this year, please don’t try
to have a good time, because,
given the above twisted logic, if
you have to make an effort, then
it is obvious that you are having
a miserable time to begin with.
It’s just like balancing on those
handle bars: you can’t try to
bend them and you can’t try not
to bend them; what happens is
what’s going to happen.

Trying too hard is the number
one reason most people have
such a miserable time at F.D.
Ever gone to a party where alco-
hol is in nearly unlimited supply
and decide before hand that
you're going to have a REALLY
GOOD OLD TIME (in all caps,
just like that)? What happens?
You wake up the next morning
in the same clothes, with myster-
ious mud on your cheek and a
headache that feels like someone

4

 

hand-screwed a rusty car axle
into your skull. That‘s what
happens when you try too hard
to have a good time.

Or let’s address the F.D. Date
Syndrome. Desperately, you as-
ked this girl / guy at the Cockpit
on the Wednesday night prior to
the Big Day. How well do you
know this person? What is her
/his last name? You've forgot-
ten? Or did you ever even know
it? And you’re going to tell me
you plan to spend a fun-filled
THREE DAYS WITH THIS
PERSON? Please. It will take
exactly one evening—Thursday
night, let’s say, en route to the
pavillion—to exhaust the entire
list of conversation topics you
drew up in Accounting class
Thursday morning. Then what?
Aha... you tried too hard, see?

How do you not try too hard?
Well, if you have a date with
whom you might not be rela-
tively comfortable, don’t plan
anything. Not even dinner. Part
of the fun, excitement, and topic
of conversation will be trying to
figure out where to go next.
Someone might benevolently

ia

and drunkenly invite you over to
dinner, maybe give up a couch,
or perhaps move into your hotel
room. And don’t drive any-
where—STAY OFF THE
ROAD PLEASE—but instead
try crashing where you drop. Let
it happen and ride out the whole
experience to see what lies on
the other side. You’ re in college.
Don’t worry about it.

And if you still insist on trying
to have aREALLY GOOD OLD
TIME this weekend, as indicated
previously, it might behoove you
to know that a certain biology
major informed me that taking
vitamin B before drinking helps
your body absorb alcohol with-
out diminishing the effects.
Something like that. Apparently,
the. enzyme in the body that
breaks down drinking alcohol
gets used up, leaving you dehy-
drated and feeling like there is a
sock on every tooth the next
morning; but vitamin B causes
your body to produce more of
this wonderful enzyme, so you
don’t use it all up in the course of
the night. Neat, huh? And to
think you balked at the science
requirement.
