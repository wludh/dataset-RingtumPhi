Womens’ group
.gets new name

’

 

By Jessica Reynolds
Staff Reporter

 

Trident, previously known as
Women’s Forum, has put on a new
face.

“We are not here to change the
campus, nor are we a radical move-
ment. We are here to create other op-
portunities and alternatives. We
want to encourage new ideas as a
whole,” said junior Alston Parker,
president of the organization.

It has been two years since the
women students at W&L created an
organized program directed to help
provide leadership opportunities,
social outlets, sports activities and
community service involvement for
women.

Trident was formed in the spring of
1986 and is housed in what is known
as the Women’s Center, which will
also undergo a name change.

The center is located in the base-
ment of the University Center, in
what used to be the television room.

Now the area has been divided into
a television/social room and a study
room. It is brightly lit, has lounging
chairs, couches, a large television
and plants.

The group appointed Meredith
Walker, a junior, to head a commit-
tee responsible for forming policy
and bylaws for the center. Under this
committee, the center will be renam-
ed for a woman in W&L’s history,
said Parker.

Trident is expecting a lot of support
and hard work from its officers —
junior Julie Sheppard, vice-president

and treasurer; Catherine Baillo, sec-
retary; and Erin Crosby, Elizabeth

Smith, Kara Cunningham and
Kristen Haring, class represen-
tatives.

Freshman representatives will be
elected Oct. 13. A pizza party for
freshmen will be held following the
elections.

The freshman elections are being
held later so that they can meet each
other and learn more about the
organization, said Parker.

The officers of Trident are con-
cerned about freshman involvement
in the organization.

“The problem is: How do we con-
tact them and let them know they are
wanted?” said Smith.

“We hope to encourage all
undergraduate women to become in-
volved. It’s their enthusiasm and
participation that makes it a suc-
cess,’’ she said.

“It is a great way to incorporate all
three classes of women,” added
Smith.

“Through freshman involvement
we can create a lasting bond with the
organization and strengthen the par-
ticipation and leadership also,’’ said
Parker.

Trident meetings will be held every
Monday at 7 p.m., and all meetings
are open to the public.

The group has begun to make plans
for a social calendar, fund-raising ac-
tivities and community service pro-
jects.

“Hopefully through community
service, we will have a positive im-
pact on the community,” said
Parker.

Parents’ Weekend is the first
target for a group social activity.
Plans are in motion to hold a cocktail
party for parents of all students that
weekend.

The group is making an extra ef-
fort to put forth a “positive energy
which will add to the existing system
rather than detracting from it,’’ said
Crosby.

“T think since the reorganization of
the group this fall, we have seen so
much more positive attitudes and
more enthusiasm about the group
itself,’ said Sheppard.

Parking problem called ‘horrible’

Some of the most frequent com-
plaints at W&L have been about the
perennial parking problem that con-
tinues to plague the University. As
anyone who commutes from off-
campus knows, parking near the
classrooms is a precious commodity.

“Every morning it gets more in-
teresting to see how creative parking
gets in the ‘corral,’’’ says E.C.
President Brad Root. “There is a
definite need for more parking
facilities for upperclassmen who live
off-campus.”’

“The freshmen have to park near
Liberty Hall. That is so ridiculous!”
said junior Jessica Reynolds, in
reference to the distant parking
facility currently used by freshmen.

University Proctor Charles F.
‘“‘Murph’”’ Murray readily acknowl-
edges that an overcrowding problem
continues to exist in such parking
areas as ‘‘the corral,” the parking
area located in front of the Universi-
ty.
“It’s horrible, isn’t it?” says Mur-
ray, regarding the morning conges-
tion of the “‘corral.”’

“T’ve told the University architects
that if they’d take out those fancy
curbs they could have 50 to 60 more
lots down there — to which they
replied, ‘We can’t have it looking like
a shopping mall.’ ”

Murray says the administration
meets every three to four months to
discuss the on-going parking problem
and ways in which it can be resolved.

“I’m in on [the administration]
about it every week,” he said. Mur-
ray added that this past summer the
Law School parking area was ex-
panded to ‘‘get the students off the
road,”’ a task currently being under-
taken at the new Gaines Hall, where
towing of cars parked on the street
has begun.

However, if Murray is quick to
acknowledge a problem, assistant to
the president Frank Parsons is just
as quick to dispel one. According to
Parsons, the only problem that exists
is that ‘everybody wants to park
within 30 seconds of their destination
and they are unwilling to walk.”

Parsons describes W&L parking as
quite adequate in comparison to the
parking situation at other colleges
and universities where, he said,
students take it for granted that they
are expected to park far from their
classes and do a great deal of walk-
ing.

“Sure [W&L students] think we’ve
got a parking problem. It’s because
they can’t park next to the dorms,”

he said, Parsons said that available...

parking spaces total about 1,000, with
half of those being designated for
commuting students.

Parsons added that at present,
there were some parking lots off-
campus still not being used by
students, most notably the lot on
McDowell Street near Gaines Dorm.

“There is plenty of space there for
Gaines Dorm residents, but when I
drove by last night, there were
maybe two cars parked there,’’ said
Parsons.

Parsons said that until all existing
parking is used, students will con-
tinue to complain.

“Tf people are willing to park in the
available lots and walk that extra
five minutes, then we will have no
problem,” he said.

Parsons also said he wants
students to realize the parking solu-
tion lies on the edge of the campus,
not within it.

Two remedies to the situation have
been discussed by Parsons and Mur-
ray. One is to build a parking garage
in downtown Lexington that would be
used by both students and _ local
citizens. However, according to Par-
sons, city approval would be needed

The officers think the new
organization will work much better
and can be a part of the W&L system.

“We are trying to improve our im-
age and the image of women at
W&L,” said Cunningham.

Office hours for Trident are 4 p.m.
to 6 p.m. Monday, Wednesday and
Thursday. Tuesday hours are 11 a.m.
to 1 p.m. and Sunday the office is
open 7 p.m. to9p.m.

A suggestion box is located in the
center, and the officers said they are
more than happy to hear from any-
one for suggestions.

 

IFC establishes
two seminars

 

By David Emrich
Co-Editor

 

Last night, at their regular weekly
meeting, the Inter-Fraternity Coun-
cil voted to establish two seminars to
educated the freshmen who pledged
a fraternity.

The measure, which passed unan-
imously, established two 30 to 45
minute seminars, to be held in con-
secutive weeks. These seminars
would educate fraternity pledges on
their responsibilities as fraternity
members.

According to IFC President Mark
Farley, the first meeting will concern
Alcohol Awareness and the second
will deal with the IFC Constitution,
focusing more closely on the IFC’s
guidelines for safe partying.

A third meeting, on hazing, was re-
jected by the IFC even though
Associate Dean of Students Leroy C.
““Buddy”’ Atkins warned that, if any
problems with hazing occured, the
Trustees have decided to revoke the
involved fraternity’s charter with no
chance for appeal.

The first program, according to
Farley, will be conducted by Special

sh ee

Agent Koger Stevens of the Virginia
Alcohol Beverage Control and
another speaker who has yet to be
named. The second program, said
Farley, will be conducted by Atkins,
any member of the IFC Judicial
Board who wishes to participate, and
Farley. No firm date or time has
been set for the meetings and the
Fraternities’ pledge programs will
not be delayed.

Also at last night’s meeting, Atkins
warned that there will be stricter en-
forcement of the IFC’s Regulations
for Parties, especially the section
which requires food and alternative
beverages at all fraternity parties.

“In the past,” said Farley, “the
IFC looked the other way as far as
some rules were concerned. But that
is not going to be the case anymore.”

Any violation of the food and alter-
native beverage requirement will be
treated as a regular social violation
and the offending houses will be
given social probation, said Farley.

According to Farley, several~
fraternities were given violations by
the Lexington Police for having trash
in front of their houses. He said that
any future violations would result in
an additional $50 fine imposed by the
IFC.

for that.

Another proposal, according to
both Murray and Parsons, is to
create a multi-level parking facility
behind Doremus Gym, where two
parking areas currently exist.

However, Parsons says such a pro-
ject would be extremely costly for
the University and unlikely in the im-
mediate future, since construction on
Gaines Hall is still being completed.
Until then, if off-campus students

Phote by Amanda Hughen

expect to park near the University,
they are encouraged to leave home
early. Otherwise they should be
prepared to park as far away as
Liberty Hall, and to take along a pair
of walking shoes.

New director plans new career programs

 

By Stacy Morrison
Staff Reporter

 

Tipping back in his chair, with his
hands behind his head, Dr. Richard
Heatley speaks of his welcome to
Washington and Lee and Lexington
as both ‘warm and encouraging.”

As well it should be, for Heatley, an
involved, energetic individual, was
named Associate Dean of Students
and Director of Career Services in
April. He has a great deal of excite-
ment and experience to offer to the
position, which he assumed on July 1
of this summer.

Heatley worked in career planning
for eight years at Wake Forest
University. Initially he was a pro-
fessor of classics, but in his 17 years
at Wake Forest, he became in-
terested and involved in ad-
ministrative activities. In 1979, he
was named associate director of the
Career Planning and Placement Of-
fice at Wake Forest. In 1983 he
assumed the position of director of
that office.

Heatley said of Career Planning at
Wake Forest, ‘I enjoyed it a lot and
found it new and interesting since it
was something I didn’t have training
and background in.”’

Heatley is a ‘Texan by birth,’’ who
lived in Fort Worth and attended

Forth Worth High School. He receiv-
ed his bachelor’s degree from Baylor
University, where he had a triple ma-
jor in Latin, Spanish and education
with a minor in religion. Heatley then
attended University of Texas at
Austin where he received a master’s
degree in Spanish and a doctorate in
classics. In 1971, he was awarded a
Fulbright-Hayes Fellowship to Italy,
where he taught two semesters of
programs abroad in Venice. Heatley
is also a member of Omicron Delta
Kappa leadership society.

Heatley is a member of profes-
sional associations, including the Col-
lege Placement Council, the
Southern College Placement Associa-
tion, the Middle Atlantic Conference,
the Skylark Liberal Arts Conference
and the Association of Pre-Law Ad-
visers. These organizations ‘‘assist
us in training the students for their
oC employments,” Heatley
said.

Beyond his professional interests,
Heatley is also active in community
organizations and services. He was a
deacon and choir member of the
Wake Forest Baptist Church, and
hopes to continue singing here in Lex-
ington. He was also a United Way
university coordinator.

Heatley and his family reside in
Lexington. His wife, Ester, teaches
at Waddell Elementary School. They
have two children; a son who is atten-

ding Lexington High School and is in
the 10th grade, and a daughter in the
third grade. He said he and his wife
“are avid gardeners.’’ But beneath
all his calm pastimes and interests
lies a four don black belt. Heatley ran
a program in karate at Wake Forest
for 13 years. He instructed 125
students per semester and would like
to run such a program here. Heatley,
the first formal director of the Career
Development and Placement Center
for more than a year, has many
responsibilities, including individual
and group counseling, career infor-
mation, job hunting workshops,
management of recruiting, outreach
activities and service as a pre-law
adviser. Heatley will also teach a
Latin course in both the fall and
winter terms.

When asked of his plans for the
Career Center, Heatley commented
that he was “excited by the fine
caliber of the Washington and Lee
students. It is a positive thing to ‘sell’
to recruiters who know that these
students are academically driven.”’
Which, he added, is important for a
school of this size. Wake Forest is a
university of approximately 35,000
students, but Heatley finds little dif-
ference in the work for him.

“T don’t perceive the work load as
being any lighter due to the fact that
the slack got taken up by the fact that
the staff here is not as large.”

Heatley has already accomplished
a great deal for the Career Center.
His approach, he said, is ‘full on-
campus recruitment,”’ meaning that
he wants to reach as many students
as possible.

“Traditionally,”’ said Heatley,
“those who used the service were the
poeple who were ‘career specific,’
those who were pre-law or intending
to be in conventional business, such
as Sales or banking.”’

However, Heatley wants to at-
tempt to reach out to those with no
career focus or those who have ma-
jors in areas such as art, music or
history. ‘‘Those students are the ones
who need direction,’ Heatley said.
“This is one of the goals of the
outreach program.”’

Among the new services to be of-
fered are Career Lecture Series,
Alumni Career Assistance Program,
Summer Job Day, expanded career
library and resource library, com-
puterized office operations and
records, more video mock interviews
and a monthly newsletter. Heatley
held a Senior Placement Meeting last
Tuesday, which 175 students attend-
ed. He also reached another 37
seniors through a_ student-athlete
meeting.

“Already I have reached over 200
seniors,’ Heatley said, ‘‘and I hope

Growth affects locked carrels

 

MY VIEW

By John Starks

 

It seems that signs of our school’s
growth beyond its physical plant’s
capacity are becoming more
numerous. The freshman class has
more than 425 members, a new dorm
was built, class sizes are growing
beyond classroom space, and park-
ing spots are more and more
precious every day. Yet along with
these major examples of over-
crowding, there are also some seem-
ingly minor ones. I speak particular-
ly concerning the paucity of locked
study carrels in the University
Library.

These carrels may not be impor-
tant to most W&L students, but they
certainly are for seniors writing
honors thesis. An immediate reason
for senior acquisition of locked car-
rels is for easy access to library
sources. Anyone who has written a
major term paper knows the large
number of books he must use for such
a project. Transportation of so many
volumes outside the library is im-
practical and bad for students’
backs, especially considering the

To the Editor:
Mingled with the joys of Rush

disappointment in the

 

distances often covered by book-
toting pupils. Other sources like
periodicals, microfilms, and archive
works cannot be taken from the
library, so without a place inside the
library to examine them thoroughly,
the student is at a distinct disadvan-
tage.

The carrels’ location on campus is
also important for a student like me
who lives in the county. Without a
carrel in which to leave work, all too
frequent trips to school are
necessary.

The public carrels are not the
answer to this problem First, they
are not big enough for the student to
spread out the number of works he
may need to examine at one time.
Nor do they contain enough storage
space for sources after examination.
Secondly, there are already not
enough public carrels for W&L
students, so another space problem
arises. The public carrels are too
noisy. The library is not a quiet
place, especially around exam time.
Finally, the public carrels are too
‘‘public.’’ Anyone can use them, so if
any part of the carrel owner’s work is
moved, he may not find it.

Blame does not lie with the library.
It only has thirty-one locked study
carrels. Library officials gave
preference to student applications
from those enrolled in senior honor

LETTER

87, there is
some sadness, and, more importantly some
conduct
‘gentlemen!’ This disappointment stems from an
onslaught of insidious rumors concerning Zeta
Beta Tau’'s financial strength. We do not unders-
tand how one can comment accurately on our
house’s financial position without even review-
ing our books. Apparently, many individuals at
W&L fancy themselves clairvoyants as well as
certified public accountants. Fortunately, few
members of the audience were impressed by the
strutting and fretting of these poor players;
some freshmen took these rumors for what they
are: full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
These persons were able to see the ignorance in-
herent in the rumors. In the future, we hope
rumor-mongers refrain from tainting others’
minds with incorrect information concerning us.

preciated.

To the members of the student body:

The purpose of this letter is to dispel any
rumors which may already exist, or may come
about in the future. The Phi Chapter of Delta Tau
Delta has been adversely affected by certain
sanctions brought about by the Interfraternity
Council and the Student Affairs Committee. We
would like to make it clear that the Delt house
does currently exist as a fraternity and will con-
tinue to exist as such on the W&L campus.
Although our rush activities were canceled due
to the sanctions, we are still affiliated with our
national fraternity and have received their full
support in this difficult period. And, with their
assistance we plan to thank all of the fraternities
at W&L for their support for it is greatly ap-

courses, which is only fair. About
twenty-five applications were made
for carrels this year, mostly by
honors candidates. The University
Scholars Program requires _ its
members to write theses, so the
number of honors candidates is
larger than in previous years.
However, only fifteen students re-
ceived locked carrels because the
other sixteen are already occupied
by faculty members.

I do not begrudge faculty members
the rights and privileges of their posi-
tions, but I also believe that since
they have an on-campus office, their
needs for locked carrels are less than
those of students who must complete
honors theses. Students often cannot
control their study environment
since they live with other students
who might not be working at the
same time. The library is sometimes
the only place they can work private-
ly. If they are denied that, where can
they turn? I shall not begin work on
my thesis until the winter term, but
what can I do then and what will
others do whose applications were
denied? Compromises must be made
to faciliate the professors’ and
students’ academic demands. After
all that’s what W&L is all about. But
consideration and mutual respect
should be paramont in whatever
agreements can be made.

Most college students will in-
evitably find themsevles homesick at
some point during their education.
For freshmen it usually happens
after the novelty of doing your own
laundry, uncontroversively keeping
a messy room, and staying out late
for no apparent reason soon wear off.
Most students will miss their friends,
their pets and possibly their high
schools. This version of homesick-
ness will painfully wear off with
time; any afflicted person has
nothing to worry about.

But, on the other hand, some col-
lege students might find themselves
actually missing their families which
is chronic homesickness and very
often life threatening. An individual
afflicted with the latter type of
homesickness needs help immediate-

hurts with every word so I hope

Naturally my parents chose a

to fly to Utah, spend some leisurely
time there and then drive to Califor-
nia in a van my parents managed to
have waiting for us.

First of all, we flew on Delta

were forgetting to do trivial things
like closing the plane doors or confir-
ming that the plane was equipped
with an engine. But even worse than
this was the inevitable serving of an

at the components of any airplane
meal is frightening, but watching
someone actually eat it is undesira-

We finally arrived in Utah and left
in one hour for California (that was
our leisurely break in between
travel). Naturally, we soon en-
countered car trouble which wasn’t a
total loss because I now personally
know every mechanic between Utah
and California, and consequently can
make a few generalizations. I’ll start
with nomenclature: a threee letter
first name is compulsory. Joe, Sam,
Tim, Roy or Jim are good examples.
I didn’t meet one mechanic with a
name like Winston or Ogolthrope.
Mechanics are either incredibly am-
bitious or extremely lacadaisical.
The ambitious type will systemat-
ically disassembly your whole car
whiel you sit in the broiling sun for 3
hours. The ‘“‘lackadasicals” are
usually sitting in rocking chairs whit-
tling wood but they don’t have time to
fix your car.

right; but fortunately cars were

desert. Eventually we learned so
much from hanging out at so many
gas stations that we fixed the car
ourselves.

As you might imagine by this time
all family members wer? enthralled
with fantasies of matricide, patricide
and fratricide. Eventually we stop-
ped in Winnemucca, Nevada, which
jokingly expressed how boring it was
through billboard signs. The signs
said things like ‘‘Winnemucca — the
name says it all,”’ or “Winnemucca
— free admission.”

We soon realized that the signs
were not joking. Winnemucca’s only
asset was hiring someone smart
enough to get vulnerable people like
my family to stop there. The hotel we
stayed at had carpet thicker than a
rain forest. We lost the dog twice.

I could go on for hours about this
vacation, but I’m certain most of you
are already trying to figure out ways
to stay at college for Thanksgiving.
By the way, the climax of the trip
was seeing a sign in Conn, Calif.,
which read Conn Dam.

The Ring-tum Phi: What’s in a name?

A football cheer, a student newspaper and nearly a century of W&L history

 

By Marie Dunne
Co-editor

 

“Ring-tum Phi, Stickeri Bum!
We are the stuff from old Lexington!
» Rah! Rah! Rah! White and Blue!
Whoopla, Whoopla! W.L.U.”’
* Almost a century ago, Washington and Lee students us-
, ed to snake-dance to that nonsense football cheer during
halftime. In some later and more risque versions, the
*second line asserts that we are “hot stuff from Lex-
ington.’’ Whatever the version, it was from this favorite
“cheer that a group of students drew the name for W&L’s
«Student newspaper.
The Ring-tum Phi’s very first issue was published on
“"Saturday, Sept. 18, 1897. The front page featured
.highlights from President Wilson’s inaugural address
(no, not our President Wiison — The Honorable William
‘L. Wilson). Sports news and personal items made up

‘ most of the rest of the paper.

The paper was not suppressed and outlived the ‘‘two-
point slash’’ practice for each class cut. The paper had
survived the controversy and become a forum for student
discussion.

The paper was surviving financially as well. Within
five years, The Ring-tum Phi had pulled itself out of the
financial ruin of its first year and was clearing $500 a
year above its expenses.

The paper itself has undergone some changes. The first
issues were about four pages long. Throughout the years,
that number gradually has increased.

Hu-man-ic shoes

The size of the paper has also fluctuated. The very first
copies of the paper were printed on sheets of paper that
were approximately 11 inches by 14 inches. During the
war years when baper was scarce, the paper was printed
on smaller sheets of paper.

During the early 1980s, editors experimented in prin-
ting the paper in tabloid form. For the most part though,
the paper has been printed on paper the same size as it is
today, which is known as broadsheet.

The first illustration appeared in The Ring-tum Phi in
1898 in an ad for ‘‘Hu-man-ic Shoes”’ ($4 a pair). The first
photograph appeared on the front page of the Phi on Oct.
20, 1900. It was a photo of W&L President William Lynne
Wilson, who had died of pulmonary tuberculosis earlier
that week.

The masthead slogan added by Farrar was changed to
“By the Students, For the University’ around 1910, and
much later, the slogan was dropped altogether.

The paper, which began as a weekly paper and is cur-
rently a weekly paper, was semi-weekly from September
1921 to March 20, 1970. There were two separate staffs
and editors — a Tuesday staff and a Friday staff — to
handle putting out two papers each week.

In 1973, there was a proposal to abolish the paper. The
Publications Board rejected the proposal to suspend the
publication of the newspaper ‘‘primarily because of the
response to student questionnaires, which was strongly in
support of The Ring-tum Phi.”

Perhaps one of the most surprising things that has not
changed is the name. In 1920, the editors began an
editorial campaign to change the paper’s name.

“We believe The Ring-tum Phi has outgrown its name
and the time has come when it means absolutely
nothing,’’ said the editorial.

“The name of The Ring-tum Phi is distinctive, it has
served a useful purpose for a third of the century, it is
known and loved by thousands of alumni, and its recur-
ring issues awaited with pleasures. When old Washington
and Lee is two hundred and fifty years older, may she
still have a loyal and progressive and vigorous editor and
may his chair be in the office of The Ring-tum Phi,” the
alumnus closed.

In the next issue, the editorial headed ‘‘We concede”’
read as follows:

“The Ring-tum Phi will continue to be The Ring-tum
Phi. This was decided at the Executive Committee
meeting. We would like to see the name changed, but
we’ve been overruled and we recognize higher authori-

paper from his pocket. Farrar added a masthead slogan
to the paper: ‘‘By the Students, For the Students.”’

It wasn’t too long before people other than W&L
students began to take notice.

In 1898, the faculty habitually slashed a student’s grade
by two points for each class the student cut.

“The Ring-tum Phi here asks the Executive Committee

of the student body to pass a resolution changing the
name of the paper, which name is to be selected later,
provided the majority of the student body desires it,’”’ the
editorial continued.

The editorial caused several alumni to write in support

of the name. One letter pointed out that the editor had run

the name, wasn’t he attempting to destroy the very
publication that gave him office? The alumnus pointed

contents, not its name.

The Oct. 2, 1897, issue of The Ring-tum Phi listed ‘the
snag:’

“The numerous fraternities in our midst have been, to
some extent, hampered in their fall ceremonies by the
scarcity of freshmen. Nevertheless some have done quite
well and are not bewailing the hard times.” The article
then went on to list the names and total number of
pledges for each house:

Sigma Chi—4

Sigma Alpha Epsilon—3

Phi Kappa Psi—4

Sigma Nu—4

Kappa Alpha—1

Delta Tau Delta—3

Mu Pi Lambda—1

Kappa Alpha also pledged four transfer students.

Freshman beanies

An editorial in the May 10, 1966 issue discussed the lack
of parking facilities on the W&L campus.

“As the number of student-owned cars increases, the
problem of inadequate parking space on campus grows
more severe. It has now reached the point when the hap
py soul with a 10:15 a.m. class is unable to park
anywhere, save in the rutted auto graveyard behind
Doremus Gymnasium.”’ read the editorial.

While many of students’ concerns have remained the
same, many others have changed. One 1959 front page
story was headlined ‘‘All freshmen warned about
beanies.”’

“Freshmen will not be granted permission to remove
their beanies at the Homecoming game this year, unless
some of them begin to show respect for the age-old W&L
beanie tradition, according to Rich Aberson, Chairman of
the Assimilation Committee.’

Freshmen wore their beanies until the Homecoming
game and were allowed to remove them after the game
only if W&L was victorious, according to the article. Ap-
parently, some freshmen were seen at the previous foot-
ball game without their beanies. There was no later men-
tion of the success of this threat.

Year round Coca-Cola

The early advertisements perhaps best show the
changes that have occurred since the Phi’s first issues.

“Dropsy cured with vegatable remedies. Have cured
many thousands of cases called hopeless,” read one ad.

“Williams, The Students’ Barber,” promised ‘‘every-
thing strictly first class, a clean towel with every shave.’

Gorrel’s Pharmacy advertised ‘Coca Cola all through
winter” and the local utility company’s advertisements
said Lexington had 68 telephones.

One ad read: “Found—Saturday morning in front of
Dr. Howe’s, a shoe, number 3 1-2 C. Having a long tongue
it is supposed to be of feminine gender — Gen. R.E.M.”’

Infirmary has new M.D.

 

By Cecily Tynan
Staff Reporter

 

New faces, new hours and a grow-
ing concern with AIDS mark some of
the changes at the Student Health
Center this year.

The biggest change is the addition
of Dr. Jane Horton-Marcella to the
staff of University physicians. Last
year, with the retirement of Student
Health Director Dr. Fredrick Fed-
deman, the University’s Student
Health Committee was faced with the
task of finding a new physician. As
chairman of the Student Health Com-
mittee, Dean of Students Lewis G.
John pointed out ‘‘there was a desire
for a female doctor.”

After “extensive evaluation,”
Horton-Marcella proved most apt for
the job. Horton-Marcella’s record
shows many qualifications.

She attended Dartmouth Universi-
ty for her undergraduate studies and,
after completing medical school at
the University of Vermont, spent one
year of graduate studies at Cornell
working in student health.

Horton-Marcella said this year pro-
vided her with a lot of experience and
showed her that ‘student health is
the area in which I want to work.”

Then she spent a three-year intern-
ship and residence at the University
of Virginia Hospital, specializing in
internal medicine.

In June 1986, Horton-Marcella
moved to Lexington with her hus-

band, veterinarian Kenneth
Marcella. Here she opened a private
practice with a local physician.

After being a student in the third
class of women at Dartmouth, Hor-
ton-Marcella said she understands
the changes and demands on a
university when it first goes coed.
She feels it is ‘important that W&L
recognize the changing needs”’ and is
“looking forward to developing
special interests in health care for
women.”

Other changes at the Health Center
include new doctors’ hours. The doc-
tor will be available at the center
from 8-10 a.m. and from 4-6 p.m.

Unlike former years, there will be
no doctors’ hours during the
weekends. The doctor will, however,
make regular visits to those students
recuperating in the 12-bed infirmary.

In addition, an examination room
has been moved to accommodate a
new office and a door has been added
to reduce noise.

Keeping up with current health
concerns, the committee will also be
investigating an AIDS-testing policy.
As new Student Health Director Dr.
Robert M. Pickral comments, ‘“‘At
this point W&L is not screening ap-
plicants for the AIDS virus and the
University has not formulated a
policy as of yet, although we are
planning [to formulate a policy] in
the near future. Information on AIDS
is, however, available [in the Student
Health Center] since we do feel it
necessary to educate students about
AIDS.”

Lexington case reaches Supreme Court

 

By Marguerite Ayers
Staff Reporter

 

A rape case decided in 1984 by jury
trial in the Rockbridge County Cir-
cuit Court ascended the ladder to the
United States Supreme Court, only to
find itself in a hearing Thursday in
the same court where it began.

Daniel R. Tinsley was found guilty
on February 9, 1984, and sentenced to
50 years in prison for the rape of a
Randolph-Macon Woman’s College
student in a Lexington fraternity
house on September 15, 1983.

The case was denied appeal by the
Virginia State Court and went to the

Fiom Staff Reports

 

The Washington and Lee Universi-
ty Concert Guild opens its season
Thursday, Oct. 1, with the Roxbury
Chamber Players and Max Lifchitz,
pianist. The concert will be at 8 p.m.
in Lee Chapel on the W&L campus.

The program will consist of music
by living Virginia composers who are
members of The American Compos-
ers Alliance, which is celebrating its
50th anniversary. Works by Judith
Shatin Allen, Jael Eric Suben,
Johann Franco, Robert Stewart, and
Allan Blank will be performed.

Lifchitz is a graduate of The
Juilliard School and Harvard. His
compositions have been performed
throughout the United States, Latin
America and Europe. As a pianist, he
was awarded the first prize in the
1976 Gaudeamus Competition held in
Holland. His works are available on
the CRI, Finnadar and Opus One
record labels.

Allen, whose work Gazebo Music for
flute and cello will be performed,
teaches at the University of Virginia.
She holds a Ph.D. from Princeton,
M.M. from the Juilliard School of

returned to the Virginia Supreme
Court, affirmed, and sent to the Cir-
cuit Court system. The circular path
of the case through the courts was
caused by a landmark decision in
Kentucky that altered the nature of
Tinsley’s appeal.

Tinsley’s case was before the
Virginia Supreme Court when the
Batson vs. Kentucky case was decid-
ed in 1986 and caused the affirmation
of Tinsley’s appeal, due to a question
raised on the appointment of jurors
for his trail.

Supreme Court Justice Lewis
Powell gave the majority opinion on
the Batson case, which ruled that
potential jurors could not be struck
by the prosecuting attorney for pure-

ly racial reasons in cases with racial
undertones.

The Batson case reversed a 1965
decision, Swain vs. Alabama, which
ruled that ina potentially racial case,
it was lawful for the prosecuting at-
torney to strike jurors for whatever
reasons he saw fit as long as there
was no established pattern of racial
discrimination in jury selection.

Judge George E. Honts III, presid-
ed over a three hour hearing Thurs-
day to determine if former Com-
monwealth’s Attorney John Read,
the prosecutor in Tinsley’s case, was
guilty of discriminatory practice
with an intent to deprive the defen-
dant of a jury of his peers.

American music. His composition,

the United States in 1934. He was a
charter member of the Southeastern
Composers League and has been a
member of the American Composers
Alliance almost from its inception in
the early 1940s. Though Franco has
written music for every medium, he
has specialized in composing for the
carillon, including a cantata for
soloists, chorus, brasses and carillon

Also new to the Career Center is
the ‘‘Credential Service,”’ which is a
folder that all seniors will have. This
folder will contain resumes and perti-
nent information on the student for
use in recruitment. The recruitment

system has also been slightly altered.
In on-campus recruitment, where a
representative of a company visits
the campus, ‘‘students can no longer
just sign up for a recruitment date,”’
Heatley said. Now they need to come
in and set up their credential file, and
sign up through him, to help both the
recruiter and the student keep things
more organized. Be also said that he
wants to concentrate more on off-
campus recruiment, where he helps
train students and assists them in
finding a job in the field in which they
would like to work.

The Career Center also assists in
helping undergrads find an intern-
ship program for the summer or
other periods of time.

“Internships offer an avenue to
clarify career objectives and give
job-related experience,” which is
often crucial in finding a job later in
many liberal arts fields, reads the
Career Office’s last newsletter.

“If there is one message I need to
get to the students,” said Heatley, “‘it
is ‘soon.’ I know that things are busy
here now, but careers are perma-
nent.”’

Work begins on convention

 

By Pat Heffernan
Staff Reporter

 

While the 1988 Mock Convention
doesn’t culminate until March 28 and
29, work has already begun for
everyone involved.

The primary task for the directors,
said co-director Lester Coe, is to
balance the convention’s $100,000
budget.

The directors also are trying to ar-
range five speakers for later in the
academic year, closer to convention
time. They hope that at least one of
the speakers will be one of the front-
running candidates.

Work begins soon on researching
the individual states.
chairmen must determine how the
people living in their assigned state
would vote, and inform the delegates
of which candidate to choose at the
convention, said Coe.

There are three state chairmen
spots open to freshmen.

Coe encouraged freshmen and up-
perclassmen to get involved with the
convention. Coe said it is the biggest
event of the academic year both for
the school and Lexington.

Approximately 1,800 people are in-
volved in the convention. Lexington
hosts a parade on Friday, March 28.

Admissions office moves to new location

 

by Christie Champlie
Staff Reporter

 

The admissions office of
Washington & Lee University, now
housed in Washington Hall, is
scheduled to move to 32 University
Place on Sept. 29.

The move will give the office many
advantages not available now and
will provide an aesthetically pleasing
place to work, said assistant admis-
sions director Mimi Milner Elrod. At
present the admissions office does
not have the space or privacy for the
staff and secretaries that the new
house possesses, said Elrod. In terms
of logistics the renovated house will

The Admissions Office’s new home.

The new house will offer easier ac-
cess for visiting prospective students

and their parents since there will be a
site reserved for visitor parking.
Another advantage of the new facili-
ty is that it will give visitors a chance
to see the inside of a house on the
front campus.

The house was originally built in
1941-2. It was used to house faculty
members until 1972, when it became
offices for the religion and classics
department. The house was vacant
since 1981.

’

The new admissions house will be
named for Dean Frank J. Gilliam,
who served as the first dean of
students at W&L. Gilliam worked at
the University for fifty years. He was
an undergraduate student here in
1913, and graduated in 1917. After
graduating, Gilliam served in the
military for one year, taught for a
year at Augusta Military Academy,

North Carolina Dance Theatre kicks off series

 

From Staff Reports

 

Great entertainment is coming
your way this year at no charge to
you. Because Washington and Lee
University is a major contributor to
the Rockbridge Concert-Theatre
Series, W&L undergraduate and law
students may attend the following
professional performances just by
showing their student I.D. cards at
the door.

The schedule of events begins Oc-
tober 4 at 2:30 p.m. with the North
Carolina Dance Theater at Lexington
High School, followed by the Amherst
Saxophone Quartet on October 28 at
8:00 p.m. in Chandler Hall at
Southern Seminary Junior College, 4
Child's Christmas in Wales on
December 6 at 2:30 p.m. at Lexington
High School, The Boys Choir of
Harlem on January 31 at 2:30 p.m. in
Jackson Memorial Hall at Virginia
Military Institute, and the Ellis Mar-
salis Quartet on March 23 at 8:00
p.m. in Lee Chapel.

In Paris, the North Carolina Dance
Theater was proclaimed ‘“‘superb....
sufficiently armed to conquer the
world’? by Le Figaro. The North
Carolina Dance Theater’s arsenal is
its diverse repertoire and the ver-
satility of its 18 dancers. Its members
perform a complete spectrum of
dance styles from ballet to modern
dance. Salvatore Aiello, the N.C.D.T.
artistic director, spoke en-
thusiastically of the varied program
they will pertorm in Lexington to
“especially beautiful music of Pro-
kofiev, Chopin and Ravel.”

The Amherst Saxophone Quartet,
equally at home at Carnegie Hall or
the Kool Jazz Festival, offers a mix
of classical chamber music and jazz
with a liberal dose of humor in be-
tween. The unique qualities of the
soprano, alto, tenor and baritone sax-
ophones will be revealed in a pro-
gram that ranges from Bach to the
quartet’s trademark Eubie Blake
rags.

With A Child’s Christmas in Wales,
poet Dylan Thomas captivated aud-
iences with his fond rememberance
of a traditional, often comical, Welsh
Christmas in the 1920’s. Through the
imaginative eyes of a child, this new
musical brings to life the wonders

Peer counseling in 2nd year

 

by Ed Christian
Staff Reporter

 

After a successful first round, the
peer counselor program begins its
second year at Washington and Lee.

Headed by University Psychologist
James Worth, the peer counseling
program began last January. The
program is designed to help students
who need someone to talk to, but
would not feel comfortable going to a
university psychologist.

The Peer Counselors are a group of
students that have been trained in
such areas as alcohol and drug
abuse, listening skills, and emotional
support. The names and telephone
numbers of these counselors will be
posted in numerous places around
the campus. A student may call a
counselor and ask to meet with him.

However, after two or three
meetings, it is suggested that the stu-
dent see a professional.

To become a peer counselor a stu-
dent must first contact Dr. Worth or

Carol Caulkins. Then, an application
is filled out, followed by an interview
and finally a training session.

The training session deals with
listening skills, learning facts about
alcohol and drugs, being able to
recognize signs of certain problems,
skills in communication and, in order
to help others, a peer counselor must
have a certain amount of self aware-
ness.

According to Dr. Worth, the most
important aspects of a_ peer
counselor are the abilities to listen
and understand problems, and to pro-
vide an accurate referral.

Peer Counselors is still a budding
program. All sixteen counselors last
year had some sort of contact with a
troubled student, but the acceptance
of the student body is still
undetermined.

Dr. Worth says it will take at least
two years to determine if the peer
counseling program will be a success
at Washington and Lee. The program
has not yet begun for this year, but
Dr. Worth hopes to begin by early Oc-
tober.

1987 Graduate assaulted

 

From Staff Reports

 

Early on Sept. 5, class of ‘87
graduate John G. Koedel was struck
in the face by a crowbar or tire iron
while walking from the Stop-In on
North Main Street toward Randolph
Street, according to police reports.

No suspects have been arrested.

“All I remember is walking along
by the laundromat, getting hit, then
lying on the ground with him stand-
ing above me, saying, ‘What did you
do to her?,’ ” said Koedel.

Koedel explained that while he was
in the Stop-In parking lot, a man ina
blue car pulled up and called him
over. The man told Koedel that he
had been on his hall freshman year at
W&L, but Koedel told the man he
didn’t know him.

‘‘He said he knew me, but I had no
idea who he was,” said Koedel.

Koedel then went into Stop-In,
made a purchase, and spoke with the
girl at the cashier’s counter about
what had happened outside. He said
she laughed about the incident and
they spoke briefly before he left.

Walking toward Randolph Street,
Koedel was attacked by the man he
had seen at Stop-In. He described the
suspect as white, in his 20s, with light
brown hair and a large tattoo of a
spider on his left shoulder.

“He hit me square in the teeth; he

chipped three and knocked out three
and spilt my lip,’’ Koedel said.

Koedel said he had always thought
he was safe in Lexington, and was
overwhelmed by what had happened.

“T walked around that way my four
years at W&L and I would tell anyone
now, don’t walk around alone,
especially on side streets,’’ he said.

Lexington Chief of Police Bruce M.
Beard Jr. said the case is still being
investigated.

“Suspects have been interviewed,”
Beard said, ‘‘with no results.”

Leads are being checked on blue
vehicles, but the license plate
number is unknown.

Koedel said a new lead is currently
being pursued that involves a VMI
graduate who knows of a man witha
spider tattoo.

Beard commented that student
assaults have been ‘‘very rare’ in
Lexington and that there is no pat-
tern of such instances.

Koedel speculated that the man
may have been jealous of the conver-
sation he had with the girl at Stop-In,
but he thinks there is an overall
animosity toward college students
from some of the local residents.

“T think they do it just to college
students,’’ he said, referring to
similar instances in the past.

“It’s a shame,” said Beard, ‘‘He
had teeth knocked out, and I just
hope they can be transplanted.”’

 

Trial

 

O Continued from Page 4

black was struck from the panel
because he thought the man worked
at a neighboring fraternity from
where the incident took place.

Tinsley’s attorney, Malcolm G.
Crawford, said his client is entitled to
another trial.

Judge Honts commented that the
Batson decision may cause a flood of
cases with racial undertones to reap-
pear in court. ‘‘I can see the scenario
of a case tried 15 years ago coming

back to court. But the Supreme Court
is the final arbiter of th@se things,”
said Honts.

No decision was reachéd in the
hearing, according to Clerk of the
Court Bruce Patterson, who com-
mented that the case had become
complex.

The case will be decided following
the submission of a brief within ten
days by Crawford, followed by a
response within seven days by the
present Lexington and Rockbridge
Commonwealth’s Attorney, Eric Lee
Sisler.

Judge Honts said he would be
prompt in closing the book on the 1984
case following a review of the briefs.

After a weekend off, the
Washington and Lee football Gen-
rals will be trying for their first win
{ the season against the College Col-
onels, the 14th-ranked team in Divi-
sion IIL pre-season polls and a team
ith 15 returning starters.

The Generals suffered one of their
ughest losses of the 1986 season to

the Colonels. After a long trip to Dan-
ville, Kentucky, W&L was shut out
through most of the game until
tailback Kevin Weaver scored on a
one-yard carry with only 1:10 re-
maining. The Generals went for two
on the conversion, but quarterback
Jon Thornton’s pass fell incomplete,
and the Generals were sent home
with their second loss in as many
games.

lacrosse star Redfern
transfers to Chapel Hill

By Jim Lake
staff Reporter

 

One of Washington and Lee’s
lacrosse standouts last season is now
attending classes at the University of

Vorth Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Neill Redfern, a sophomore at
Washington and Lee in 1986-87, of-
ficially withdrew from W&L on July
24, according to University Registrar
scott Dittman.

After recording 42 goals and 32
\ssists for the 1987 Generals, Redfern
is now playing fall lacrosse for the
‘Tar Heels and will be eligible for the
1988 season.

In a telephone interview with the
Roanoke Times & World News, Red-
fern said his decision to withdraw
wasn’t based solely on athletics. ‘‘It
wasn’t strictly a lacrosse decision. I
just wanted to go to school’’ at Chapel
Hill, said Redfern.

‘Members of my family have been
going to Carolina forever, but I
couldn't have played lacrosse [at
UNC] right out of high school,” ex-
plained Redfern. “ I'm really taking

 

a risk to come here now, but it really
is worth it tome.”

A member of the 1987 Old Domin-
ion All-Conference team and the
Generals’ team leader in goals
scored last season, Redfern said ‘‘I
felt like I’d already proven myself at
Division III.’’ However, Redfern said
W&L’s switch from Division I to Divi-
sion III in lacrosse after the 1986
season ‘‘had nothing to do with’’ his
decision to transfer.

When contacted by The Ring-tum
Phi, Redfern refused to comment.

W&L head coach Dennis Daly told
the Roanoke paper that Washington
and Lee provided Redfern with a
waiver that will allow him to play
this year. However, Daly said
Redfern will not be eligible for a
scholarship.

“It didn’t serve us any purpose to
stand in his way,”’ said Daly. ‘I don’t
think it will be a trend. Neill con-
sidered transferring after his fresh-
man year.”

Tim Nelson, an assistant lacrosse
coach at Chapel Hill, told the Phi that
Redfern is a ‘pretty good player”
who will make the team.

by graduation. ‘‘We saw them play
against a pretty good Maryville team
last week,”’ said Fallon, ‘‘and they've
improved in spots where we thought
they might be weaker.”’ The Colonels
racked up nearly 300 yards rushing in
torrential rains and won that game,
6-2.

Fallon pointed to sophomore
quarterback Mark Brown (6-1, 195)
as one of Centre’s best players. New

Soccer drops third,
Silva scores twice

 

By Gary McCullough
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee men’s
soccer team is still having a difficult
time piecing things together after the
third game of the season yesterday
against Mary Washington College.

Having basically the same line-up
as last year, it looks like it could just
take some time before things start
flo.. ‘ag smoothly.

Yesterday afternoon, Mary Wash-
ington arrived at Smith Field only to

leave with a 5-1 victory. The lone
scorer was sophomore Rick Silva.
Ball control was the main problem as
the ball tended to remain on W&L’s
half of the field for the majority of the
game. It was a defensive struggle
from the outset.

One of the team co-captains, senior
Chris Gareis, said that there is ‘‘a lot
of skill on the team.’ The team
started off slowly in the first half, and
was unable to come back from a a 4-1
deficit.

W&L tried changing the field posi-
tioning to generate some offensive
action, but nothing worked. Mary
Washington is a very highly-ranked
team in Division III, and the

Generals have defeated them only
once in the last four years.

Last Saturday, the team suffered
its second loss of the season, bowing
to Greensboro College 2-1. Silva, who
scored the only goal of that game as
well, said, ‘We have the same per-
sonnel as we had last year,”’ and the
team has the potential for even more
talent.

“Something’s missing in the
chemistry of the team,” Silva said,
and the problems just cannot be pin-
pointed yet.

The Generals’ next game will be
Saturday when the team travels to
Maryville to open its Old Dominion
Athletic Conference schedule.

big problems for football

Brown is “capable of running the
ball on options and scrambling when
he has to,”’ said Fallon. ‘As wet as it
was [against Maryville], he threw
the ball with some authority.”

The Colonels’ leading ball carrier
is junior runningback Greg Lawson
(5-11, 195). “I hope we don’t run
across a harder runner than him all
year, because he was just chewing up
Maryville’s defense,”’ said Fallon. In
that game, Lawson carried 31 times
for 186 yards.

The Colonels defense lacks size,
but Fallon said the Colonels really at-

Fallon predicted a passing game if
the weather is good for this
weekend’s home opener. ‘‘We hope to
air the ball out. We’ve got a good
group of receivers, and we feel we
can protect our quarterback,”’ said
Fallon. Overall, the tenth-year head

From Staff Reports

 

The Washington and Lee water
polo team, which earned a No. 19 na-
tional ranking after it won the W&L
Fall Classic a week ago, won two of
three matches last weekend at the
Northeast Varsity Invitational at
Providence, Rhode Island.

The Generals, 6-1 on the season,
lost to Bucknell 12-10, and then beat
Slippery Rock 15-5 and Richmond
10-7.

Although the team had a successful
record, head coach Page Remillard,

was not particularly pleased with the
way the Generals played in the two
WiNS. 44 we- *

“Athletically, we are playing at a
high level, but mentally we are play-
ing at a much lower level,” he said.
“The 2-1 record looks good, but I am
not too excited about our intensity. If
we continue to play without intensity
we will be in for a rude awakening.”

This weekend, W&L will travel to
play in the Virginia State Champion-
ships. The Generals and the Spiders
of Richmond, which has won the title
the last four years, are expected to
reach the finals of that tournament.

Cross country opens at Mary Washington

Freshman key to women’s success

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Two years is not a long period of
time with which to build a winning
program. In fact, after their first two
years of existence, the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers had compiled a stellar
1-27 record in the National Football
League. For the Washington and Lee
women’s cross country team, how-
ever, the road to success has not been
so rough.

Beginning only their third season
of operation on Saturday at Mary
Washington, the Generals seem on
the brink of a winning season. Com-
ing off last season’s 3-6 record and
third-place finish in the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference, W&L has its
top harrier returning in junior
Stephanie Smith. Smith, who was
10th in the ODAC championships with
a time of 26 minutes, 42 seconds for
five kilometers, was W&L’s highest

finisher in the South-Southeast
Regional meet (28th, 25:56).

“Everyone's doing a great job,”’
said head coach Jim Phemister. ‘‘We
have five new freshman runners and
I'm really impressed with how hard
they are working.”’

Two of those five freshmen, Page
Cason and Lovell West, will be join-
ing Smith and junior Anne Geary as
the top four runners on the team.
Phemister speculated that the key
fifth spot would probably be filled by
freshman Heather Jenkins.

The most important goal for W&L
is to be competitive in the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference. Phemister
said it is too soon to predict which
schools have the best chance to take
the conference title.

“My guess is that both Eastern
Mennonite and Lynchburg are are
going to have good teams once
again,” he said. ‘“‘But none of the
teams have run in meets yet, so it is
too early to tell.”

 

Kurtis Blow would have been proud

Free agency is the main issue here

Look at baseball and basketball, you hear them cry
The salaries there are much to high

In the NFL, the average make 300 grand

That’s a lot of bread to put in anyone’s hand

The owners wonder ‘what do we have to do?

Wash their car? Shine their shoe?’

Everybody say ‘Where’s all the money at?’

 

Here it is! Hot off the presses. The song you’ve all been waiting for

The players, you see, are real upset

And the owners don’t want to deal with nobody yet
Gene Upshaw, is the players rep

While Jack Donlan is the owners’ pet

Donlan won’t sit down and try to talk

So Upshaw says ‘it’s time to take the walk’

CHORUS:

Where’s all the money at?

Men have top two runners returning

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

To the Washington and Lee men’s
cross country team, winning seasons
seem almost second nature.

The Generals, coming off their
ninth-consecutive winning cam-
paign, will begin their quest for dou-
ble digits Saturday when the team
travels to Mary Washington for a tri-
meet against the host school and
Washington College.

“The men have worked hard to
build a successful program and have
done very well in the past,”’ said head
coach Dick Miller, whose team
posted a 13-3 record last season. ‘‘I
have been fortunate to have coached
athletes who have motivated them-
selves and have disciplined their
minds and their bodies.”’

Miller has his two top runners
returning in senior co-captains Scott
Rippeon and Richard Moore, both of
whom represented W&L at the NCAA
Division III Championship in 1986.
Rippeon and Moore, as well as since-
graduated Ted Myers, were the key
reasons for the team’s second-
place finish in the Old Dominion

Athletic Conference and third-place
finish in the NCAA South-Southeast
D-III championships. Moore came in
third in the S-SE Regional with a
time of 27 minutes, 25 seconds over
eight kilometers, while Rippeon
followed close behind in fifth place
(27:29).

Looking at the upcoming season,
Miller, who also serves W&L’s
associate athletic director, is so far
pleased with the way his runners
have performed in the early time
trials.

“Most of the boys had stayed or
had gotten into pretty good shape
over the summer,”’ he said. ‘‘They all
ran well.”

Looking at the conference, the
Generals can expect the biggest
challenge to come from Roanoke Col-
lege. The Maroons are the defending
ODAC champions and have been
establishing themselves as a national
power.

“Roanoke will be tough,’’ said
Miller. ‘“‘However, they lost some
people from last year. I wouldn't
even predict anything because a
team can get one or two people and
get wellinahurry.”’

Join a ‘spirit team’ and win

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Washington and Lee promotions
has come up with a way for W&L
students, faculty or staff to engage in
friendly competition while suppor-
ting the school’s athletic teams.

The idea is called the McDonald’s
Generals Spirit Competition and is
sponsored by—you guessed it—
McDonald’s.

“The charge to promotions is to get
more people at the games,’’ said
promotions director Dennis Daly.
“Particularly students, to generate
interest among the students.”’

Here’s how the competition works.
All you have to do is register a team
of 25 (maximum) students, faculty or
staff members and then attend as
many athletic events as you can.

The teams will compete each
athletic season (fall, winter, and

spring) and throughout the academic
year to determine which team has
shown the greatest athletic spirit.
Every time you go to a game, you
sign in and your team receives one
spirit point.

The seasonal champion will
receive coupons for food at
McDonalds and the cumulative win-
ning team at the end of the year will
be awarded McDonald’s General
Spirit Award T-shirts plus an award
winning picnic.

Every athletic event counts equal-
ly so a team receives just as many
points for going to, say a football
game as it would for a women’s soc-
cer game.

“McDonalds] wanted exposure to
all sports,”’ Daly said. ‘They did not
want to be labeled to just one athletic
activity.”

The rosters are due by Tues., Sept.
29, and may be turned in at Daly’s of-
fice located on the 500 level of
Doremus Gym.

The Ring-tum Phi, September 24, 1987

a Bamba destined for gold

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

The summer of 1987 was an ex-
cellent summer for the movies. Old
good guys became new good guys as
Stribek, Friday and Elliot Ness
returned to the screen. Jaws returned
for a fourth feeding, the nerds came
back for a second beating, and a
modern day Cyrano wooed Daryl
Hannah in an updated reading.
Stanley Kubrick came out of the
shadows with Full Metal Jacket,
Bigfoot came out of the woods in
Harry and the Hendersons, and vam-
pires came of of nowhere in The Lost
Boys.

Many films exhibited excellent
qualities this summer, yet, none put
them all together the way the sum-
mer’s best overall film did.

La Bamba is 1987’s finest summer
film. The rags to riches success story
of Mexican-American rocker Ritchie
Valens is the latest chapter of the
most written about tragedy in rock
history (the winter plane crash that
killed Valens, Buddy Holly, and J.R.
“the Big Bopper’ Richardson) and
the finest rock biography to come to
the screen since the Oscar winning
Coal Miner's Daughter.

Director Luis Valdez has done a
beautiful job of putting together
Valens’ story. His incorporation of
Ritchie's nightmares about dying in
a plane crash and the lines fore-
shadowing the ultimate crash give
“La Bamba” a tight coherence. In
addition, Valdez’ direction of Lou
Diamond Phillips in the lead role is
excellent; pulling out of him the
head-strong, determined character
that Valens sings about in ‘‘La Bam-

Trio Familiaris

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

A near capacity crowd filled Lee
Chapel Tuesday night as Professor
Timothy Gaylard, his wife Catharine
Gaylard, and her brother Peter Clark
presented the first concert of the
198788 Washington and Lee academic
year. The ‘Trio Familiaris’’
presented a well-rounded one-and-
one-half hour evening of selections
ranging musically from Mozart to
Gershwin. Mr. Gaylard played piano,
Mrs. Gaylard sang soprano, and
Clark sang tenor and played the
violin.

Though excellent in its entirety, the
concert seemed to gain momentum
as it unfolded. The first selection,
“Non so piu, cosa son” from ‘The
Marriage of Figaro’ by Mozart open-
ed the concert well, but was paled by
the second selection, ‘‘Elegie’’ by
Jules Massenet which blended the
soprano, piano, and violin quite
beautifully.

The performance continued with
sections featuring tenor and piano,
soprano and piano, and finally a third
vocal section featuring Mrs. Gaylard
and Clark in ‘‘Suleika und Hatem”’ by
Fanny Mendelssohn, and ‘‘Herb-
stlied’’ by Felix Mendelssohn with
accompaniment by Mr. Gaylard.
Both pieces were performed with an
excellent vocal blend and touch.

Mr. Gaylard then finished the first
half of the program with a dynamic
performance of Franz Listz’s ‘“‘Wid-
mung’’ whereafter he exited follow-
ing two calls to the stage.

Words In Edgewise

A slice of

By Marshall Boswell
Staff Reporter

 

 

With all due respect to Leonard
Nimoy (who is probably a very fine
actor in his own right), it has always
seemed to me that the part of Spock
on the ‘Star Trek’’ television series
would be one of the easiest parts an
actor could ever play. I mean, think
about it: the character’s basic
premise is that he cannot show emo-
tion. So what is there to act? Just
deliver the lines as dryly as possible
and you got it.

Which is pretty much how I feel
about Bret Easton Ellis’ novels.
Although Ellis displays genuine ver-
bal talent as well as a startling eye
for unconventional, yet appropriate,
detail, the fact remains that there
isn’t a whole hell of a lot to his novels
— no emotion, no insight, no passion,
no character development. As any-
one who’s read Less Than Zero would
testify, that’s precisely the point:
Ellis’ characters are so jaded that
they have no emotion, no insight, and
they never develop into anything
substantial. Which is fine and good
—Ellis might be making one of the
major statements of the Eighties —
but, like Nimoy’s Spock character,
this seems to me like a pretty easy
trick to pull off. Just try writing a
short story in first person in which
the narrator strolls into a fraternity
party, comments on the dress and
background music, gets drunk and
leaves, Every person on this campus
is capable of that.

Ellis’ latest slice of pre-yuppie
nihilism is called The Rules of Attrac-
tion (Simon & Schuster, $17.95), and,
contrary to the overly-enthusiastic
disclaimer on the dust jacket, it is not
“a startling departure from his first
novel.”’ The setting is ‘‘Camden Col-
lege’ (a poorly-disguished fictional
version of Ellis’ own alma mater,
Bennington College) and the “‘plot”’
concerns a typically ‘‘disturbing’’
romantic triangle. First there is
Lauren, a beautiful, confused coed
whose boyfriend, Victor, is in
Europe. Next there is Sean (the
10vel’s most developed character),
whose passion is booze, dope and
?ole Position and who, through some
nistakenly attributed love notes,
inds himself in love with Lauren.
vast there is Paul, the novel’s bisex-
‘al realist who paradoxically has or

se EP RAE PSIA

The second half began just as the
first half had finished. Clark and
Gaylard played ‘‘Sonatensatz,” an
intensely beautiful duet for violin and
piano by Brahms that proved to be
the finest performance of the even-
ing.

Gaylard then performed ‘The Cat
and the Mouse’’ by Aaron Copland,
and ‘Prelude Number 3” by George
Gershwin which were both excellent.
As with any accomplished pianist, it
was amazing to watch the precision
and ease with which Gaylard moved
around the keys of the chapel grand
piano.

Two sections of piano with soprano
and tenor featuring the works of
Tosti, Poulenc, Faure, and Satie

    

ba” “Yo no soy marinero, soy
capitan!”’ (I’m not a sailor, I’m the
captain!)

The film is well-shot and also well-
written. Newcomer Phillips does a
good job as Valens and an excellent
job of lip-synching the music.
Veteran actress Rosana DeSoto is
fantastic as Valens’ mother as is
Elizabeth Pena as his sister-in-law.
There are, however, two things about
La Bamba that stand out in ex-
cellence. :

Esai Morales will receive an
Academy Award nomination for his
performance as Valens’ brother Bob.
His performance as the Jekyll and
Hyde jealous brother was the finest
performance of the summer and will
be included as one of the five best of
the year come March.

The second thing about La Bamba
that is four star is its soundtrack. Los

plays tochape

followed setting up the final trio per-
formances for the finale. Throughout
the performance it seemed that each
selection was better than the one
before it, culminating with the final
piece, ‘Contentment’ by Arthur
Goring Thomas that was indeed, the
finest trio performance of the con-
cert. The blend between Mrs.
Gaylard and Clark was both clear
and Beautiful.

All in all, it was a wonderful even-
ing of music and a wonderful start to
the Washington and Lee Concert
year.

Other performances to watch for in
the coming weeks include: Thurs-

posers Alliance Concert with the

Trio Familiaris — Gaylard, Gaylard, and Clark,

pre-yuppie nihilism

imagines he has an affair with Sean
and who once did seem to have had a
fling with Lauren. There is no central
narrator, but Ellis rather employs a
system Faulkner used in 4s I Lay Dy-
ing whereby the characters take
turns narrating the events.

Ellis handles his chosen technique
well, presenting the same events
from two and sometimes three amus-
ingly different points of view. The
narrative structure is central to the
theme suggested in the title, as well:
Part of the “rules of attraction” is
that no one is really allowed to con-
nect. This multiple narrator struc-
ture allows Ellis to suggest a world
where characters meet and converse
and fornicate and slip away but
never lend themselves to each other;
anybody’s point of view is as valid as
the next. We never know if Paul and
Sean truly ‘‘connect’’: Paul
describes the affair in seat-
squirming detail, but Sean never
acknowledges a thing. Who's telling
the truth? In one of the few instances
of real ‘‘development,”’ Ellis
manages to sway the reader’s trust
away from the shallow yet ultimately
romantic Sean and over to the sharp-
eyed and caring Paul.

But basically, that’s it. Ellis’ chief
literary device is the run-on sen-
tence. His stream-of-consciousness is
pale and poorly developed, showing
every indication that it is usually the
author’s ‘“‘stream’’ and not his
characters’. He never bothers to
develop any metaphoric or symbolic
depth but rather lets various rock
songs (which he assumes, probably
correctly, that his audience has
heard) serve as the novel's reoccurr-
ing metaphors.

Lauren is supposed to be the most
complex character in the romantic
triad but comes off as the most two-
dimensional, and this is Ellis’ fault:
his idea of depth is to have the
character be sincerely in love (near-
ly every one of Lauren’s sections in
the first half of the book opens with
the sentence, ‘‘Victor hasn’t called’)
and have her write poetry. Sean is
Ellis’ best-developed character
Simply because he is the most
shallow. He thinks Lauren’s poetry
“doesn’t make sense,” so. pre-
occupied is it with girls sitting
around complaining about absent
boyfriends and menstrual periods.
Sean’s dismissal of Lauren's poetry

has broader inipiucations as well

since his description of it pretty
much describes Ellis’ book. In fact;
The Rules of Attraction turns on itself
at one point when Ellis has a un-
favorably potrayed “‘literary type”
pose the following question:

“But...let me ask you, don't you think
that the admittedly outlaw scribblings
of these wasted post-lietnam, post-
Watergate. post-... well, post everything
minstrels, is the product of a literary
establishment bombasting a lost
generation with worthless propaganda
exploiting greed, blased sexual at-
titudes and mind corrupting, numbing
jejunosity and that’s why works like
[Expletive], a searing, searing collec-
tion of quote-unquote underground
writing, becomes potent figures on the
minds of this clan of maladjusted,
nihilistic, malcontent, self-serving...
well, hell, miscarriages, or do you think
it’s all. bogus?” (p. 198)

By putting this passage in his book,
Ellis makes a snotty-nosed wink to
all his supporters: ‘‘Aren’t I clever? I
know what they’re all saying about
me, and don’t they sound ridicu-
lous?’’ But after finishing the novel,
one is still tempted to say, ‘‘Yes, it is
all bogus,”’ to which Ellis can simply
answer, ‘‘I knew you'd say that, you
fool.’’ He even brings back Clay, the
jaded narrator of Less The Zero, for
an ill-advised cameo appearance in
which Ellis parodies himself and
both of his novels by having Caly
observe, “People are afraid to merge

on campus after midnight” — an
almost exact echo of Less Than Zero’s
opening sentences, ‘People are

afraid to merge on freeways in Los
Angeles.”’ All of this self-refrence
and self-ridicule is irritating and
maddening and displays, above and
beyond everything else, that Ellis
has a distorted view of his own im-
portance. He’s a mildly talented
young writer: where does he get off
thinking he’s James Joyce?

The Rules of Attraction is technical-
ly better than Less Than Zero, but
literary worth was never the issue
with that book: the issue there was
shock value. Ellis’ gimmick is wear-
ing thin. Basically I think the guy
was simply published too early for
his own good. By now, unfortunately,
it might be too late.

Lobos has done a phenomenal job of
recording Valens’ hit records. The
originals were in such poor condition
that they could not be used for the
film ‘“‘La Bamba.” “Come on Let’s
Go,” and ‘‘Donna,”’ Valens’ three
biggest hits, highlight the first side of
the soundtrack with Marshall Cren-
shaw and Bo Diddley helping out the
Lobos on the ‘‘B”’ side. Though not on
the soundtrack, Carlos Santana and
Miles Goodman also contributed
original music to the film.

La Bamba is a film that should not
be missed. Just as The Buddy Holly
Story pointed out what a tragedy the
death of Buddy Holly was, La Bamba
does the same for Ricardo Valen-
zuela — Ritchie Valens. It is an in-
tense, touching film that will forever
remind us of the loss we suffered
“the day the music died.”

Music Critic

 

Introducing SCRAM!, a band that
you’ve probably never heard of, but
one that you really should get to
know. SCRAM! consists of 2 brothers
(Matt and Greg Mungen, handling
vocals and guitar) with Craig Heim
on drums. Be open-minded and look

past this band’s silly, sort of sub-
stellar name and give them a listen.
What you're going to hear is a white-
American version of strongly reggae-
inspired socially conscious lyrics
with a generally uptempo feel-
progressive music flavored by reg-
gae but definitely not overwhelmed
by it. They’re reminiscent of a muted
General Public Ip, but without the ac-
cent. SCRAM! just released their

For the unknowing freshman and
any upperclassmen as well, Wash-

tion, WLUR on 91.5 FM. The station
plays a wide variety of music with
“music blocks” ranging from pro-
gressive rock to traditional jazz to
classical. The station hours are from
6:30 a.m. to 2 a.m. on the weekdays, 9
a.m. to 2 a.m. on Saturdays and 9

Chris Martin, the director of rock

first album named Stand Up which
entered the college charts at No. 95
with the promise of moving up swift-
ly as it gains more exposure. It’s
been getting better than moderate
rotation at WLUR.

The ist three songs on the front
side, ‘‘Here tonite,’ “Freedom,” and
“Our World” are rather unpolished
and simple (it is only their ist album)
yet they appealingly get their
message across. The band seems
wholly sympathetic to the plight of
black South Africans as the lyrics
and titles of the songs more than
‘subtly suggest. However, SCRAM!
doesn’t make the listener nauseous
with goody-goody anti-apartheid sen-
timentality — which is good. Again,
the music is flavored by that sen-
timentality, yet not overwhelmed by
it. “Something to Cling to” is essen-

“Imagine.” Sorry John, (gasp of hor-

you. Imagine that. The ‘‘B’’ sideends ~
with ‘‘Move a Mountain” and “Don’t _

finish off a solid introductory L.P. -

in the future, and maybe another
