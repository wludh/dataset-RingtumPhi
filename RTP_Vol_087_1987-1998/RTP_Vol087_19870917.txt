W&L's chapter of Delta Tau Delta
has been put on a year’s social proba-
y tion by the Inter-Fraternity Council

judicial board in response to a sum-

ty for incoming freshmen, at which
minors were served alcohol.

« While driving home from the party

and remains in a coma.
® Delta Tau Deita, under the social

probation, will not be permitted to
hold any social functions for the

Farley, summer rush parties are

‘governed by the same rules that

Orientation brings new activities

The 1987-88 academic year began
“ with a week devoted to Freshman
» Orientation. This year’s orientation
. schedule differed from that of
* previous years, in that there were
» More social activities and up-
perclassmen were more involved in

University President John Wilson

' “TI think those kinds of activities

meet other freshmen in a very effec-
tive way,” said Ruscio.

Farley said that Cole was invited to
a party held by Delta Tau Delta in
Potomac, Md., at the home of the
parents of two Delt alumni, David
Blackwood, Class of *80, and Michael
Blackwood, ’87.

Cole, 18, was served alcohol at the
party, said Farley. This, according to
Farley, was not necessarily in viola-
tion of IFC regulations.

‘In this case,’’ said Farley, ‘‘serv-
ing alcohol was not necessarily
against IFC policy, although there
were certain requirements that they
had to fulfill.”

“That would include providing a
bartender who’s over 21, providing
sober transportation if necessary,
not serving intoxicated people. Pret-
ty much the guidelines as they're set
forth in the [IFC] Constitution.”
Farley indicated that Delt had
followed all of these policies at the
party.

At about 11 p.m., one-half hour
after Delt had stopped serving
alcohol, Cole left the party with two

freshmen can come together as a
class in something other than the
placement tests.

“The Alumni Association, their
philosophy is that from the moment
you set foot on this campus, you are
an alumnus. So, this is a way of in-
troducing the students to each other
as the newest alumni of Washington
and Lee.”

There are no definite plans for
changes in next year’s orientation,
but there are ideas to make it
shorter.

“I think we’d do a better job in less
time ... In order to do that, I think
there would have to be some changes
in what we actually do. It’s not a mat-
ter of taking everything that we do
and putting it into a shorter amound’
of time,” said Ruscio.

‘The freshmen are just anxious to
get going, and the main thing they
wanted to do was get in, take some
classes, and get moving.
~“Miy impresstun is that this is a
very outgoing, friendly, interesting
freshman class. They showed last
week that they are eager to join in,
eager to get on with college.

“There is a student group this year
which, for the first time, came up
with some ideas for improving orien-
tation...and that’s something I would
definitely like to continue. I would
love to have students more involved
in some of the activites. I think this
year showed them that good things
can happen.”’

other freshmen. Cole did appear to be
intoxicated when he left the party.
However, the driver of the car was
sober, said Farley.

The group returned to the party at
about 12:30 am. Farley said that they
had had alcohol, not previded by the
Delts, during the hour-and-a-half
they had been away.

Cole went inside the Blackwood’s
home to use the bathroom after ap-
parently trying to get a ride home
with a freshman woman who had also
been at the party. The woman, who
was sober, asked Delt President
Kevin Webb to prevent Cole from get-
ting in her car with her. However,
when Cole came out of the house, he
went right past Webb and got into the
car with the woman, according to
Farley. Webb, said Farley, then went
back into the house, leaving Cole in
the car with the woman.

“In the IFC’s mind,” said Farley,
“there was a breakdown of respon-
sibility at that moment. Up to that

In addition to changes in the orien-
tation schedule, this was also the first
year that women had specific ac-
tivities to do during Fraternity Rush.

Julie Sheppard, Vice-President
and Treasurer of Trident, formerly
the Women’s Forum, explained that
activities for the freshmen women
were planned for each of the three
nights that the men had open houses
for the fraternities.

On Tuesday there was an ice
cream social hosted by all of the
female faculty and administration.
Wednesday night after the barbeque
there was a Women’s Orientation in
the Moot Courtroom. Thursday night
was the Big Sister/Little Sister din-
ner and meeting.

“T think the ice cream social that
the faculty and administrators did
worked out really well...and there
were quite a few at the orientation on
Wednesday night,” safd Sheppard.

The women’s orientation was at-
tended by both freshmen and up-
perclass women. It served to explain
the role that women play at
Washington and Lee and to answer
any questions that women on campus
might have had.

“T think it was a good start to the
year just for the upperclassmen to
have a chance to meet the freshmen
and to familiarize themselves with

point, Delta Tau Delta was making
every attempt to control the party.”’

About 10 minutes later, the woman
got Cole out of her car and left. Cole
then got into his car and was on his
way home when the accident oc-
cured.

According to Dean of Freshmen
Kenneth Ruscio, Cole’s car veered
across the center line into the path of
an oncoming tractor trailer. The car
swung sideways and the tractor
trailer hit the car on the driver’s side.

The impact knocked Cole to the
passenger side of the car, causing ex-
tensive injuries to his pelvis, legs,
and head.

Cole remains on a respirator and in
a coma at Suburban Hospital in
Olney, Md.

Delt President Webb declined to
speak about the incident on advice of
counsel.

Associate Dean of Students Leroy
C. ““Buddy”’ Atkins said that a lawyer
representing Cole’s father has con-

tacted him for preliminary informa-
tion, but Atkins has not been able to
get back in touch with him.

Delta Tau Delta’s faculty advisor,
Burr Datz, said to his knowledge, the
fraternity had not yet been contacted
by a lawyer for Cole.

Datz said, ‘In terms of violation,
we broke the rules, we will take our
medicine.

“What it comes down to is that we
will have to become a_ service-
oriented fraterntiy for a year.”’

Right now, according to Webb, the
Delts have a tentative plan in mind to
begin an alcohol awareness pro-
gram.

Webb said that their national head-
quarters has sent a representative to
advise them on this program. Webb
said he plans to develop a program,
in cooperation with the Virginia
Alcoholic Beverage Control and the
University, on alcohol awareness and

 

 

risk management for fraternities. He

freshmen during the student activities fair.

also said Atkins had suggested that
they also take the program to high
schools and junior high schools.

“T think it will have an impact,”
said Webb, “because it will be
students doing the presentation and
not the police or the ABC.

“We'd like people to know we're a
good house and we're going to stay
that way.”’

Datz said, “I don’t foresee us hav-
ing any financial problems this year
(since Delt will have no pledge
class).”’

The pledge dues for Delta Tau
Delta are $75 a month, said Datz. He
estimates that with an average
pledge class of 15, Delt will lose $1,125
per month. He feels the house can ab-
sorb this loss.

“All members will have to live in
the house. As long as there is rent,
the corporation can take care of pro-
perty, taxes, insurance’ and other
needs, said Datz.

number of rush offenses against the
house. If a house receives three rush
violations then they have their rush
privileges suspended for one year.

Also hit hard was Kappa Sigma.
They were fined $500 for allowing
brothers to have hard liquor at one of
their rush parties. Kappa Sigma
president David Collerain said that
he thought the rule banning hard
alcohol was unclear. ‘‘We thought it
was a grey area. It seemed more of a
guideline thana rule.”

However, Kappa Alpha president
Jay Markley, whose house was fined
for a similar violation, said he
“thought the rule was clear.”’

freshmen dorms. Unlike previous
years, when parties could be easily
found in the dormitories, this year
the sight of a beer in the halls is not
as common. Also different is that one
may need a pass key in order to gain
admission to a certain hallway.
These new rules have been a popular
subject of many conversations.

The freshmen response to the
alcohol policy has been negative. One
freshman claimed he wants a place
to relax and drink. Since contact with
the fraternities is limited, freshmen
want todrink in the dorms.

However, this can result in serious
consequences. The first time a dorm
counselor finds a student possessing
alcohol, the alcohol will be con
fiscated and the student will be
assigned labor hours when he or she
must complete a task, such as clean-
ing the library. In addition, Jay
Gorlowski, head dorm counselor, will
record all violations in a student file
Subsequent violations of the policy
will result in more drastic punish-
ments and the student will be refer
red to the dean of freshmen who will
decide how to resolve the problem

 

Kappa Sigma was also cited for a
non-rush offense in that they made
alcohol the theme of one of their par-
ties. The party has not yet taken
place but was on a schedule printed
by the fraternity. For that second of-
fense the fraternity was put on a
month of conduct probation beginn-
ing immediately and a week of social
probation beginning on Sept. 22.

When a house is on conduct proba-
tion, according to Atkins, any viola-
tion of any type, no matter how
minor, will result in social probation
for the entire fraternity.

In addition to Kappa Sigma and
Kappa Alpha, the following houses

This new, stricter policy was
brought on by many factors. One
main reason is that no Washington
and Lee freshman is of legal drinking
age in the state of Virginia. As Dean
of Freshmen Kenneth Ruscio points
out, ‘‘As an institution in Virginia we
must abide by the rules imposed by
the state. Although we want the
dorms to be an enjoyable place to
live, if we don’t enforce the law, it
will be enforced for us.” This self-
governing protects the student from
police raids since, if the policy is
followed, there will be no need for
police involvement.

Another reason for establishing the
policy is to provide the freshmen a
clear understanding of the universi-
ty’s view on drinking. Moose Herr-

ing, an assistant head counselor ex-
plains, “The difference [from last
year* is that last year the punish-
ment for alcohol was left to the
diseretion of the dorm counselors.”
This resulted in inconsistencies in the
punishments for violations, These in-
consistencies were unfair since the
same violations would receive dif-

ferent punishments according to
what dorm counselor controlled the
hall. Now the dorm counselor has no
choice but to report the violations
since Gorlowski adamantly warns

were also fined $500 for allowing hard
liquor at their parties: Beta Theta Pi,
Chi Psi, Pi Kappa Phi, and Sigma Phi
Epsilon. Sigma Alpha Epsilon was
fined $500 for a contact violation. It
was the first rush offense for all the
fraternities involved.

According to Atkins, all the
penalties were approved by the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee and are
final. There was one appeal, but it
was denied.

Preceding last night’s Judicial
Board meeting was the weekly IFC
meeting.

At the invitation of the IFC, Special
Agent Stevens of the Virginia Alcohol

not reporting a violation, that
counselor will be fired immediate-

Less of a controversy are the new
security measures. In Graham-Lees,
Gilliam, and Davis, the female

Beverage Control addressed the
meeting on the ABC’s plans for enfor-
cing Virginia’s alcohol laws this
year.

Stevens admitted that it was im-
possible to stop underage drinking by
college students and that, provided
the fraternities follow the IFC’s
guidelines for safe partying, there
should be no problems.

He continued, however, to say if a
fraternity is having an open party
then ABC agents have every right to
attempt to enter that party. Once in-
side, said Stevens, the agents could

arrest people for violations of
Virginia law.

Stevens concluded by saying that

hallways are locked at midnight and
the residents of the halls are given
pass keys. Plans to install locks in
Baker are underway. This security
was added after there were a few in-
cidents involving people outside the
university entering the women’s

Chief of Police Bruce Beard and the
Lexington police would cooperate ful-
ly on all these policies.

Also discussed at last night’s
meeting was a preliminary plan to
delay pledge programs for three
weeks in order to hold three seminars
for the benefit of the freshmen.

IFC president Mark Farley said he
had three programs in mind; one on
Alcohol Awareness, one on the IFC
constitution, and one on hazing. This
plan, however, is very preliminary
and Farley said that he and Atkins
would try to develop a formal pro-
gram to present to the fraternities at
next week’s meeting.

Gaines Hall is still in progress

 

By Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

Each morning, the sounds of saws,
hammers, and industrial equipment
working on the $8.1 million new
residence hall greet the residents of
Gaines as well as those of Gilliam
and Davis.

“Tt was much worse last year,”
noted fourth floor Gilliam Dorm
Counselor Dee Dee Truett. The new
dorm was scheduled to be completed
on July 31.

Weather conditions hampered the
construction of Gaines. The
temperature was too hot and rainy in
the summer and too cold in the
winter. Also, the gatehouse, which
will connect the wings of the dorm,
proved to be more complicated to

eae ss

build than was originally thought.

The gatehouse remains incomplete
as does the landscaping for the dorm
quad. Gaines residents are still in-
convenienced by construction work-
ers in the halls and outside the win-
dows.

Three weeks before school started,
the rooms had not been completed,
but by Sept. 1, the resident assistants
were able to move in. The rest of the
students moved in Labor Day week-
end or during the week before classes
started.

Currently, 195 students reside at
Gaines. The 114 females and 81 males
consist of 174 upperclassmen, 14 law
students, and 7 freshmen. Originally,
the dorm was to be for upperclass-
men only, but law students were
allowed to live at the new dorm to
help defray the cost of building the

dorm. Over-confirmation of fresh-
man rooms resulted in the assign-
ment of freshmen to the dorm. Room
for 53 more students exists.

Space at the Woods Creek apart-
ments is also available. Only 121 peo-
ple out of 178 possible occupants live
at the apartments. The reason space
is available ‘-z-oincides with one of
the reasons thew dorm was built.
According to Fri% Parsons, assis-
tant to the president, the population
of students at Washington and Lee is
expected to undergo ‘‘modest
growth.’’ The space is available to
accommodate the population in-
creases from approximately 1,350 to
1,500.

OPINION
Changes

A number of people have expressed displeasure with this
year’s revised Rush, both verbally and on the backs of T-
shirts. However, people should look closely at the new rules
and see what the Interfraternity Council is trying to accom-

 

plish.

The shortened time period keeps Rush from interfering
with students’ academic loads. This benefits freshmen and
fraternity men alike. Having the majority of Rush functions
over before class starts allows everyone to concentrate on
what they are here for in the first place: academics.

Limiting freshmen to only one night of fraternity parties
(not including the ones at which they can accept their bids)
admittedly puts the houses under a lot of pressure, but it does
take some of the emphasis off the social aspects of the house.
Freshmen who make their decision solely on the basis of how
wild a fraternity parties may be sorely disappointed after

they join.

Fraternities are being pushed back to what they originally
were: groups of men who lived, and worked together in a

spirit of brotherhood.

Unfortunately,

fraternities at

Washignton and Lee over the years have put an undue em-
phasis on parties. Hopefully that will begin to change.

There is one very valid complaint this year, however. Forc-
ing freshmen to sign up for open houses before having any
contact with fraternities except for the Rush book (and the
almost inevitable dirty Rush), hurts both the freshmen and

the smaller houses.

Perhaps setting up a type of fraternity forum, where each
fraternity has a chance to make a presentation and meet the
incoming freshmen, would help the situation. It would only
set the beginning of Rush back by, one or two days, which
would preserve the valuable changes that have been made.

W&L needs a fall Rush that works, to avoid having Rush
pushed back into the winter term. If the fraternities will work
together through the IFC, this will be accomplished. Other-
wise, the fraternity system will weaken, maybe never to

recover.

Students and trash
arrive in Lexington

 

MY VIEW
By Margaret Pimblett

 

Saturday, Sept. 5, 8:56 a.m.

I was already running late for work
when I began walking down Washing-
ton Street, from its intersection with
Estill Street, toward the Stonewall
Jackson House at 8 E. Washington.

I’d made that walk nearly every
day this summer. For three months I
have lived in Lexington as a city resi-
dent, not as a Washington and Lee
University student.

Many signs had already appeared
which indicated that the summer was
drawing to a close. The Virginia
Military Institute cadets had been in
town for well over two weeks, and the
Washington and Lee law students for
just as long. The U-Haul drop-off
point on the way to Kroger’s seemed
to have twice as many trailers as
usual, and I saw more out-of-state
license places with ‘‘Washington and
Lee”’ stickers in car windows.

Yes, the masses were returning.
Fraternity members had returned to
spruce up the houses and prepare for
rush. Many students wanted to get an
early start on fixing up new apart-
ments. And some just wanted to
spend some time in town with friends
and without the hassles of classes
and school-year activities.

I needed to continue my summer
schedule for only one more day. I
would be moving the last of my
things from my apartment into
Gaines Hall’ that Saturday evening.
That morning was the last time I
would make that same walk along
Washington Street. During the three
months’ worth of walks which I had
made, I had seen an occasional emp-
ty drink can or McDonald’s bag along
those four blocks. I usually picked up
the litter that I saw, and tossed it into
the garbage can in front of the Lex-
ington Visitor’s Center.

This particular Saturday morning,
I picked up ten plastic throw-away
cups, the type used for keg parties or
picnics.

I didn’t have time to pick up the
beer bottles, the paper bags, the
styrofoam cups, and the other trash
that lay on the sidewalks, in the
street, and in the yards of the four
houses along that side of the road.
After all, [hada job to attend to.

I work weekends as a tour guide at
the Jackson House, meeting people
who come to Lexington for any of a
number of reasons.

An interest in Civil War history.
The desire to see the Shenandoah
Valley and the Blue Ridge Moun-
tains. An appointment to visit W&L
or VMI to see the campus and be in-
terviewed for admission. The search
for a vacation which was restful and
soothing, not hectic and nerve-
racking. For all of these reasons, and
many more, Lexington attracts
visitors throughout the year, but par-
ticularly in the peak travel months of
the summer. _ es

And almost’ all of the ‘summer
visitors whom I met and had the
chance to talk to had the same im-
pression.

“Lexington is such a beautiful
town,” they would say. ““You must
really enjoy living here.”

Well, I do enjoy it, even if lama
transplant and not a native.

But during the summer I met a
town with a completely different per-
sonality than the one I knew from
September until June.

The town I met prided itself on its
appearance to visitors, its clean city
streets, its quaint 19th century
facades, and its personable resi-
dents.

It promoted its professional
theatre companies, its restored inns,
even its homemade ice cream.

And it never had to apologize for
any litter problems.

But when the students return, and
the population is doubled, and the
partying begins, the garbage piles
up.

And the town is noisier, and the
parking spaces are more limited, and
more people walk down the street
without a word of greeting to the
folks they pass by.

As another W&L student said, “‘No
wonder the townspeople hate us.”’

I’m amazed that we don’t hear
more griping from Lexington citi-
zens.

They do have good reason to resent
our presence, but they’re also in-
telligent enough to realize the
positive impact that students have on
this town, particularly on the
economic development of the area.

But we as students must realize the
responsibility we have as residents of
this city. That means respecting the
community leaders and officials, be-
ing friendly to our neighbors, and
bearing with the problems inherent
in the situation of a college town.

And it means throwing away your
debris in a trash can. Just look for the
quaint, 19th century-type barrels on
the city streets.

Lexington even makes its garbage
attractive.

Frosh should have more contact

 

MY VIEW
By Laura Dodge

 

As a freshman, entering
Washington and Lee after visiting on-
ly once was a confusing experience.
Fortunately, I had all of Orientation
Week to begin to understand what I
consider to be the most involved
event of the first two weeks—Rush.
After being here only a few days, I
found all the freshmen diving into the
Rush events. Although these social
events are both fun and exciting, I
believe that their timing and the
short-term dates make Rush an un-
necessarily confusing occurence.

Since most men seem to under-
stand the rules of Rush, their confu-
sion may stem only from the pres-
sure of choosing a fraternity in the
short time allotted to decide. They
have 11 chances to meet some of the
seventeen fraternities. They have an
hour and a half to make a good first
impression, and are hopefully invited
back to make a second one. For-
tunately, most men seem to know the
fraternity houses where they feel
most comfortable. However I ques-
tion the ability to make a good deci-
sion under the pressure of making
good impressions and abiding to the
time allotted for Rush dates.

Of course, freshmen, as a whole,
are excited enough to be in college
that they don’t worry too much about
the confusion of rush dates, open

Washington and Lee has in the
past enjoyed the financial support
of many private foundations.
While foundation grants help the
University pay its bills, they as
importantly enable faculty
members to initiate new
academic programs and em-
phasis which, if successful,
become permanent parts of the
curriculum. In this way, private
foundations play a significant role
in the continuing evolution of our
curriculum. In the past three
years, Washington and Lee has
been very fortunate in receiving
five curriculum and faculty
strengthening grants from four
foundations.

The Andrew W. Mellon Founda-
tion’s most recent grant in 1985
was awarded in support of (1) our
East Asian Studies Program and
(2) a newly developing Cognitive
Studies Program. Funds from this
grant made it possible to employ
Michael Smitka, a specialist in
East Asian economic systems. He
received an appointment in the
department of Economics in 1986
and has already developed two
new courses on Japan and
China’s modern economies
(Economics 385 and 386). This
grant also makes it possible for
members of our East Asian
Studies faculty to travel and study
in Japan and China. Anne Rogers,
Roger Jeans, and Harold Hill
have already traveled and studied
under the auspices of this grant
and others will do'so in years to
come. Japanese and Chinese
scholars and artists are now
visiting our campus every year.

Contact” rules. During the two weeks
of Rush the new freshmen class is
segregated from the rest of the
school. Orientation week unites the
freshmen class, but the length of
Rush and the shortness of Rush

FROM THE HILL

Liang Heng (an authority on the
cultural revolution); John W.
Watt (Columbia University);
Masao Abe (Nara University,
Japan); Wei-Ming Tu (Harvard
University), and Michio
Tukunaga (Kyoto Women’s
University, Japan) have lectured
to university audiences and
visited our classes.

Visiting performing artists in-
cluding Koto Okamoto, Brian
Silver (sitarist), and the Tsuxma
Noh Instrumental and Dance
Group have performed here in the
last two years, helping us to better
understand Japanese music and
culture.

Our new Cognitive Studies Pro-
gram is completely funded by the
Mellon Foundation grant. This in-
terdisciplinary program brings
together faculty from the Depart-
ments of Computer Science,
Philosophy, and Psychology to ex-
plore answers to questions such as
the following: ‘In what ways are
computers and computer lan-
guages like humans and their
languages?” ‘‘What would it take
to build a computer that thinks or
that could understand, and com-
municate in a human language
like English?”’ These, and com-
parable questions, will be the
focus of a core of courses both
drawn from these departments
and newly created for this pro-
gram. (See pp. 81-2, 1987-88
catalogue.) Grants funds have
been used to increase our library
holdings (both journals and
books), to support faculty who are
developing new courses in this
field, to bring to campus
specialists in cognitive science to
lecture and consult with those
responsible for developing the
program. This past summer the
grant provided the funds for
David Elmes, Ken Lambert,
Harry Pemberton, and Joe
Thompson to attend Stanford

University’s four week
Linguistics Institute. Ramsey
Martin spent last Winter Term at
the Institute for Cognitive Science
at the University of Colorado. Asa
result of these concentrated
periods of study by members of
the faculty, many of the pro-
gram’s course offerings will be
revised and expanded.

One of Washington’s and Lee’s
most recent grants has been
awarded by the Pew Memorial
Trust. With this grant, members
of our language faculty are in-
troducing computer aided instruc-
tional exercises into the elemen-
tary and intermediate Japanese,
Chinese, Russian, Latin, Greek,
French, Spanish, and German
language courses. This past sum-
mer, Edward Hamer, Russell
Knudson, Kathy Koberstein,
Greta McCaughrin, James
Williams, and Herman Taylor
received Pew grants to write addi-
tional software programs to ex-
pand computer exercises and
testing in these languages. Harold
Hill spent time in Taiwain
familiarizing himself with

‘ Chinese computer systems in
order to learn how to write soft-
ware for his Chinese language
courses. Ten additional DEC ter-
minals have been placed in the
library, fourteen in the Computer
Center, and four in the language
lab to accommodate students do-
ing these exercises. A new Tand-
berg IS-10 language lab was in-
stalled last January to replace the
old Telex lab. Vikki Shelor has
been employed to direct the lab;
she is also responsible for new
audio/visual equipment in the lab
and five of the language class-
rooms,

This Pew grant will also be used
to support faculty members who
will develop new literature and
culture courses in the language
department. This past summer,

i

for example, John Lambeth spent
time at the Cinematheque de
Paris and the Georges Pompidou
Center and Multi-Media Library
to gather material for developing Ff
a new course in the New Wave
Cinema movement in France.
These funds will also be used to
support visiting lecturers like
Spanish novelist Carmen Laforet |}
who visited Washington and Lee
last March. The grant will support I
the language departments’ Native
Assistant Program which brings
native speakers to campus for the |
Winter Term each year to help |,
prepare students for their Spring
Term Abroad. Students with |
financial need will also be sup-
ported by this grant in covering
the costs of six week study abroad
experience in the spring.

In 1985, the Dana Foundation
awarded the University a grant to
hire three new faculty members
in physics-engineering, computer
science, and mathematics. This
grant enabled us to employ new
faculty members in areas where
they were needed to meet rising
enrollments. Kenneth Van Ness
(Department of Physics-
Engineering); Kenneth Lambert
(Department of Computer
Science); and Paul Bourdon
(Department of Mathematics
—will join the faculty in 1988-89)
will be known as Dana Fellows.

Finally, our need to purchase
new scientific equipment for our
instructional and research labs is
being partially met by scientific
equipment grants from the Pew
Memorial Trust and the DuPont
Foundation. Many pieces of essen-

tial scientific equipment have | +

very short shelf lives and are also
extremely expensive. Our new
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Spectrometer and _ Liquid
Chromatograph — both recently
purchased with these grant funds
— are examples.

women’s activities at W&L,’’ con-
cluded Sheppard.

Freshman response to the orienta-
tion week and the women’s orienta-
tion seemed very enthusiastic.

“It was like summer camp,”’ sum-
marized freshman Blair Simmons.
You don’t have to do any work, you
just go to meetings, and you...meet
all these people.

“T think the week was great, I wish
that we were still in orientation! The
mandatory meetings were a little
long, and they were at eight o’clock
in the morning, and it’s hard to sit
and listen to a speech in an uncomfor-
table chair at eight in the morning. If
they planned them to be shorter and
at better times, I think that the turn-
out would’ve been a little better at

the end of the week,”’ said Simmons.

The general consensus among the
freshmen was that many of the
meetings were too early or even
unimportant.

“A lot of the stuff...I sat through
and sort of wondered why I was
there. A lot...in Lee Chapel didn’t
seem that necessary, sort of too long.
They could have said it a lot
shorter,’’ commented freshman
Mike Badger.

“The more important speeches
were at the end of the week, and a lot
of people just said, ‘forget it,’
because they were sick of getting up
early in the morning. Maybe...they
could move the speeches back even
an hour,” said freshman Mike
Moseman,

Overall, the comments about the
orientation week were very positive
and indicate that it was once again a
success.

W&L summer
programs successful

 

From Staff Reports

 

Although Washington and Lee
University does not have an official
summer school, there has been no
shortage of students of all ages on
campus this summer.

Washington and Lee’s Office of
Summer Programs enjoyed record
and near-record attendance at many
of the programs this summer. The
first Institute for Family Business,
an innovative program that ex-
amines the opportunities and pro-
blems unique to family-owned
businesses, drew 37 participants
from 20 companies to the five-day
program.

Robert P. Fure, director of Sum-
mer Programs at Washington and
Lee, said the Institute for Family
Business “exceeded all expecta-
tions.”

“Our goal is to serve 20 companies
annually,’’ Fure said. ‘‘We are seek-
ing multi-generational representa-
tion—fathers and sons, husbands and
wives, brothers, and other combi-
nations—to study the issues, such as
succession planning, that are unique
to family businesses.”’

More than 350 high school students
applied for admission to the Summer
Scholars program. In its .seventh
year, Summer Scholars brought
students from all over the country to
the W&L campus in July for a month
long program of college-level studies
for students between their junior and
senior years in high school. One hun-
dred and thirty-two students
representing 30 states, Canada, and
Puerto Rico were selected for the
program.

“The Summer Scholars program is
now nationally recognized,” Fure
said. “The program enjoys a solid
reputation for its academics and pre-
college counseling. Also, our optional
pre-professional curricula give high
school students an unusual first-hand
look at the fields many of them are
considering.”

Fure announced that James D.
Farrar Sr., former director of alumni
admissions at Washington and Lee,
has been named associate director of
Summer Programs and director of
admissions for Summer Scholars.
Farrar will also supervise marketing
for the Institute for Family Business
and the W&L Institute for Ex-
ecutives.

the Housing surveys administered
during matriculation last year and
the advent of women on campus
three years ago. The survey results
indicated that approximately 100
students were dissatisifed with their
living conditions off campus. Fur-
thermore, women do not wish to live
off campus in more remote places
such as old farm houses. They also do
not have alternative housing such as
fraternity houses.

The many pluses to living in Gaines
are the newness of the facilities, the
weight room with nautilus equip-
ment, the computer room, and the
new laundry room where a load of
wash costs only 50 cents as compared
to 75 cents in Graham-Lees. The

gatehouse will be used as a meeting
room, party room, and lecture hall.
The resident assistants at Gaines
plan to make the dorm a community
by hosting parties for Gaines Hall
Residents only, as well as holding
parties which are open to others. The
R.A.’s wish to create social activities
during times when fraternity life
may be a little slow. They are ‘‘not
trying to become a replacement for

fraternities or an independent
center,” emphasizes head R.A.
Marie Dunne.

A few problems have cropped up
because the dorm was completed in
such a rush. First, two rooms adja-
cent to the gatehouse leaked due to a
temporary roof. Those rooms have
been cleaned and fixed and should be
ready for occupancy soon. Second,
the air conditioner is not working
very well. The halls are cool but
some of the students’ rooms are quite

warm. Third, a few of the toilets are
clogged. This stoppage is probably
due to the fact that the toilets are
residential as opposed to industrial
style.

Alcohol is permitted in Gaines;
however, the consumer must be 21
years of age. Kegs are not allowed,
and drinking must be confined to the
suites. The resident assistants must
enforce these rules as well as other
disciplinary rules. Dunne clarifies
that the R.As “are not dorm
counselors or policemen, but they
- make sure the rules are follow-

The dorm has 3 wings, A, B, and C.
The suites are basically set up as two
bedrooms with a lounge and bath-
room connecting the two. Approx-
imately one half of the bedrooms are
doubles and one half are singles.

Parking poses a problem at the
new dorm. Students are parking out-

side by the curb and getting ticketed.
The curb lacks a yellow line, but is
still a restricted area. Parsons
Stresses the fact that Gaines
residents should only park in those
areas marked G on the parking map.
“We are going to carry out enforce-
ment of the parking regulations quite
rigorously,’’ he warns. Enforcement
includes enlisting the aid of the local
police. Fourty spots are located in
the Gaines parking lot, with spill over
lots behind the gym and near the
train depot.

Right now, Gaines provides a
closer and newer location for
students in a housing crunch. Student
athletes, such as junior soccer plav-r
Tracy Williams, are able to make it
to classes and practices easier.
Gaines is also a reminder that the
faculty and the housing department
are willing to meet the students’
needs.

Lisa Alty

 

By Courtney Harpold
Staff Reporter

 

The newest member of the
chemistry department is a woman.

Lisa Alty, a doctoral candidate in
the School of Pharmacy at Virginia
Commonwealth University, has been
hired to teach primarily medicinal
and biochemistry. She is currently
teaching Modern Analytical Chem-
istry (Chem. 313), one quiz section of
General Chemistry (Chem. 101) and
one lab of Organic Chemistry (Chem.
241).

During the winter she'll teach
medicinal chemistry, and in the
spring she plans to teach
Biochemistry (Chem. 244). She also
would like to begin research on the
synthesis and evaluation of potential
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
agents.

Alty is a native of Lynchburg and a
1982 graduate of the College of
William & Mary with a B.S. in
chemistry. She intends to complete
her doctorate in medicinal chemistry
in December.

She has been married for four
years to her “high school sweet-
heart,’’ who is now a surgical resi-
dent at MCV and who still lives in
Richmond. Although she doesn’t en-
joy the arrangement, Alty stays in
Lexington Monday through Thursday
and returns home on the weekends.
As a change from her job as a scien-
tist, she enjoys sewing and knitting
“‘a lot of things housewives like to
do.”

The first and only woman in the
chemistry department, Alty talked
about the adjustments. “Any woman
in the hardcore sciences will find out
when she becomes a professional,
she’ll probably be the only woman
there. [It’s] something I knew I
would have to expect sooner or
later.” She emphasized, however,
that ‘“‘everybody has been terrific... I
don’t feel like the only woman.”

Kathleen Olson

SAO RRNA ST LTTE I

By Alisann McGloin
Staff Reporter

 

In addition to the freshman class,
this year there are some other new
faces on the Washington and Lee
campus. Kathleen Olson, a new pro-
fessor in the fine arts department
came to W&L after teaching at
McNeese State University from 1983
until 1987.

Olson is anxiously awaiting the
commencement of classes and is
looking forward to working with
students enrolled in the studio art
courses which she will be teaching.
She is very excited about the changes
which she will be instituting. One
aspect of the art department which
students may find a little different is
her own teaching technique. Olson
will concentrate on teaching the
basic fundamentals of art and each
student will work on similar assign-
ments. Olson feels the students will
benefit to a greater extent if they are
in the classroom at the scheduled
time working on an assigned project.

“My own painting is my greatest
interest,’ says Olson. Olson has even
turned her own office into a studio in
which she can paint on her own.

Not only is Olson a new professor at
W&L, but she is also the new director
of the duPont Art Galley. And Olson
encourages ‘“‘everyone to come to the
receptions” at the gallery.

Neville Richardson

By Andy Nixon
Staff Reporter

 

R. Neville Richardson, who taught
at Washington and Lee in 1985, now
returns to W&L as the Howerton
Visiting Professor of Religion.

Richardson has a B.S. from the
University of Natal, (Pietermaritz-
burg, South Africa) a B.D. from
Rhodes University, and a M. Phil.
from Oxford.

Richardson says he utilized his
religious training by both serving in
the parish ministry and teaching at
the University of Natal. Richardson
then shifted from the parish ministry
to the academic fields of religion by
becoming an appointed lecturer in
1981. Now the professor teaches one
introductory religion course and
several advanced courses primarily
dealing with theological ethics and
race relations.

Richardson says he enjoys several
activities outside the classroom, He
has a wife as well as children of ages
twelve, eleven, nine, and eight. He
snjoys squash and soccer, and plans
yn coaching a fourth and fifth grade

yoys soccer team. Richardson also is
involved with the Methodist church
here in Lexington.

Richardson says he finds Washing-
on and Lee to be a ‘‘fantastic place”
ind feels ‘fortunate to be here.”

Staff Reporter

Professor David W. Wiest, who
taught at Washington and Lee from
1981 to 1984, is returning for one year
as an instructor of accounting.

Wiest received a B.A. in 1975 from
Williams College and a M.A. in 1981
from the University of Virginia. He is
currently working on his doctorate at
the University of North Carolina.

Wiest lives in Chapel Hill, North
Carolina and commutes to Lex-
ington. He is currently single and,
when time allows, he enjoys hiking
and reading.

He will teach two sections of Acct.
201 and one section of Acct. 214.

Because W&L’s semesters are
three weeks shorter than at Universi-
ty of North Carolina, Wiest says he
will spend “‘less time on details, more
time on concepts.”’

Wiest says he is glad to be back at
W&L, one reason being small class
sizes. “It makes a big difference.
There’s a more personal feeling. It’s
easier to get the discussion going.”’

Wiest admits he does not yet have a
feel for the new W&L student, but
does suggest that they “‘spend time
on the academic activities as well.”

Christopher Comuto

By David Bekenstein
Staff Reporter

 

Christopher A. Comuto, instructor
of English, will be replacing Pro-
fessor James Boatwright who is on
leave this semester. Comuto holds a
B.A. degree from Colgate University
(1973) anda M.A. in English from the
University of Virginia, where he is a
candidate for a Ph.D. in Modern
Literature. This fall Comuto will be
teaching two writing courses and one
literature course, the 225 survey
covering early American literature.
Although he feels the course is
somewhat limited by curriculum, the
sections concerning the political
writers Jefferson Payne and James
Madison will be particularly in-
teresting in this year of the Constitu-
tion’s Bicentennial.

Outside the classroom, Camuto is a
self-proclaimed outdoorsman who is
a “fanatic for trout fishing.’ His
commitment to the outdoors led him
to help the UVA Environmental
Science Department study the effect
of acid rain, as well as serve on the
Virginia Wilderness Committee.
Camuto has also had some of his
journalistic articles published in
magazines such as Sierra and
Virginia Wildlife.

Camuto “‘loves the setting of W&L”’
and says he’s “rapidly becoming a
small town Virginian.” His early im-
pressions of W&L are influenced by
tbe ‘‘openness and friendliness of the
W&L community.’ In all, he is look-
ing forward to this year.

Joining Washington and Lee
University’s faculty this fall is Cecile
West-Settle, assistant professor of
romance languages. West-Settle
moved from the staff of Virginia
Military Institute, where she has
served since 1981. She explains her
primary reason for the change as a
result of her desire ‘‘to work in a co-
ed environment.”

West-Settle will be teaching 3
levels of Spanish this term: Elemen-
tary Spanish, Intensive Spanish
Review, and Advanced Spanish Con-
versation and Composition. She ex-
plains her course philosophy as stem-
ming from her own “personal ex-
perience as a language major in a
traditional environment,” in which
students did not actually spend much
time speaking the language in class.
She stresses that it is “very impor-
tant to use spoken language from the
first day, putting aside prior inhibi-
tions.”’

West-Settle is currently devoting
the majority of her time spent out-
side of the classroom preparing a
manuscript on nineteenth century
Spanish poet Gustavo Adolfo Bec-
quer, a personal favorite of hers.

West-Settle studied both Spanish
and French literature, but leans
toward Spanish because she ‘‘was
very interested in Spanish language
and culture, particularly because of
the blend of Eastern and Western
civilizations represented in Spain.
She refers to Spanish literature as “‘a
literature of the people, or ‘pueblo’,”
and describes it as “more spon-
taneous and less abstract and
philosophical” than French litera-
ture.

When at home with her husband,
Frank, and her fifteen-year-old
daughter, Cary, West-Settle enjoys
cooking, particularly Spanish food.
One of her favorite dishes is
“‘paella,’’ which contains rice and
either seafood or chicken. She also
enjoys running.

West-Settle earned her B.A. from
Agnes Scott College, her M.A.T. from
Georgia State University, and her
Ph.D. from Emory University. Her
hometown is Jackson, Tennessee.

the University of Virginia. Although
she will be teaching only Professor
Youngblood’s classes, she said that
she would be happy to explore new
areas if asked.

Amlinger’s hobbies — include
gardening, animals, and cooking.
“Some people even consider me an
especially good cook,” says Am-
linger. Although Amlinger still lives
in Charlottesville, she will be in Lex-

ditions — professors.

Among the new professional faces
is Thomas P. Whaley, professor of
computer science. Whaley came to
W&L from Central College in Iowa
where he was a professor of both
mathematics and computer science.
He received a B.S. degree from Lin-
coln Memorial University in 1964 and
a Ph.D. in math from Vanderbilt
University in 1968. Prior to teaching
at Central College he was the direc-
tor of the computer college at Rhodes
& Milsaps Colleges. :

Over the past 4 years, said Whaley,
the computer science department
has developed a strong curriculum,
allowing the department to offer ad-
vanced courses because students will
have strong backgrounds.

“Since I’ve had several years of
teaching at small colleges and hav-
ing experience with computer
centers as well as a strong math
background, I feel the position is
good for me.”

Whaley not only has interests in
computers, but running, camping,
tennis and hiking. He said he enjoys
the Lexington area.

Whaley is married and has three
sons. He will teach two new courses
this fall, Data Base Management and
Connectress. Both will be offered to
juniors and seniors.

Because of Dabney Stuart’s
absence this semester, there is a
temporary addition to the English
Department. Assistant Professor of
English Elizabeth Morgan will be
replacing Stuart. Morgan received
her B.A. from Hollins College (1960)
and her M.F.A. from Virginia Com-
monwealth University. She has
taught poetry and creative writing at
University of Richmond and is cur-
rently professor of creative writing
at St. Catherine’s School in Rich-
mond. Morgan has had many works
published in literary journals such as
the Shenandoah, the Virginia
Quarterly Review, and the Georgia
Review. At present, she is awaiting
the publication of her first book of
poetry entitled, “Parties.” (LSU
Press)

Morgan has three children; her
eldest son graduated from VMI, her
daughter works in Richmond, and
her youngest son goes to Christ
Church Boarding School. She has
spent much time in this area between
college and her children’s schooling
and finds Lexington ‘‘comfortable.”’

Morgan’s first impression of W&L
students is that ‘“‘they are brilliant,
self-confident, and ready to start the
new year.”’ Morgan is also ready and
excited to get working, too.

Richard Bidlack

By Jason Ladd Parker
Staff Reporter

 

The newest addition to Washington
and Lee’s history department is
Assistant Professor Richard Bidlack.
Bidlack is an instructor of European
history, concentrating on Russian
history. This year he will be teaching
“The Growth of Imperial Russia”
and “Soviet Russia” as well as two ‘
European civilization courses.

Bidlack’s interest in Soviet culture’
began early in his life, being born
during the height of theCold War. ~~ ¢

While at college, he was drawn to,
the Soviet-American relations of the
Detente period. Bidlack first visited
the Soviet Union in 1976 and returned |
‘to study in Lenigrad and Moscow
during the 1983-84 school year.

He received his Bachelor’s degree *
in history from Wake Forest Univer-
sity in 1977. At Indiana University, he
received both his M.A., in 1979, and &
his Ph.D., in 1987. Bidlack has taught
at Indiana University and lectured at
the Russian and East European In- -
stitute at Indiana University.

Bidlack intends to introduce a °
variety of Russian and East Euro-
pean courses, possibly including
courses concentrating on the Russian °
revolution, Stalinism, and Marxist-
Leninist thought. Another proposed
project of Bidlack’s is a Washington ©
and Lee study program in the Soviet
Union.

In this study program, students
would practice language skills and
tour various cultural regions of the
Soviet Union. Bidlack’s primary ob-
jective for this program is to “gain a
more direct application of Soviet
society and culture.”

Bidlack and his wife, Nancy, mov-
ed to Lexington July 11 of this year.
Nancy Bidlack is the news editor of
The News-Gazette.

Bidlack said that the small town
life in the mountains and Washington
and Lee’s strong history department
attracted him to W&L, however it
was the emphasis that W&L places
on teaching which had the strongest .
bearing on his decision to teach here.

research. In fact, as he says in his

any true scholar should be able to
share with understanding his re-
search to others.”

Outside of the classroom, Prof.
Jasiewiez, during his 2 year stay in
the U.S. has picked up on a few
American favorites. “I like the
Boston Red Sox and the New England
Patriots, but I’m still longing for a

Senior class opening convocation reinstated this year

 

»
By Margaret Pimblett
* Staff Reporter

 

‘* A Washington and Lee University
, tradition was reinstated Monday
when the Class of 1988 and faculty
* members gathered in Lee Chapel for
, an opening convocation.
A shortened morning class
«schedule allowed time for the con-
_ vocation, which began at 11 a.m. and
" Jasted about 70 minutes, and a lunch-
» eon for the seniors and the faculty.
According to Frank Parsons, the
“assistant to President John Wilson,
-until the late 1960’s the university
began each academic year with an
* assembly Attendance af thé

i convocation, held in Doremus Gym-

nasium, was mandatory.
‘ However, Parsons said, in 1969 the
, attendance policy was changed to
read that students were ‘‘expected,”’

le

not ‘‘required,” to attend.

After that change in policy, ‘‘atten-
dance was not very good,” Parsons
said.

The tradition of the opening con-
vocation was stopped in 1970, when
construction of the Warner Center
prevented assembly in Doremus, and
no other facility could accommodate
the entire student body and faculty,
Parsons said.

At Monday’s ceremony, President
Wilson said, “I am delighted that this
ancient tradition has been restored.”

In a letter to the senior class,
Wilson had written that the purpose
of the convocation was to ‘begin the
new year ie isclebtting the unity of

peveaatived ult aiprornts "

Wilson said, during his remarks at
the convocation, “We are heavily

would help contribute to the continui-
ty and faithfulness to tradition that
are part of the university.

The keynote speaker for the con-
vocation was Michael Kammen, the
Newton C. Farr Professor of
American History and Culture at
Cornell University and author of
“The Machine That Would Go of
Itself: The Constitution in American
Culture.”

Kammen spoke of the evolution of
the ideas of personal liberty and how
those ideas influenced and are af-
fected by the United States Constitu-
tion.

‘tThe conceptiof personal liberty is

tion,” Kammen said, In turn, he said,
the Constitution ‘infused personal
liberty with palpable new meaning.”

Kammen used examples from
American history to illustrate how
the theory of personal liberty has
changed.

In 1792, the concept was expanded
by the writings of James Madison,
who believed that ‘‘ ‘A man has pro-
perty in his opinion and the free com-
munication of them,’’’ Kammen
said.

“We perhaps enjoy a_ greater
degree of personal liberty than our
predecessors in American history,”
Kammen said.

“One of the privileges you have en-
joyed,”’ Kammen said to the senior
class, ‘‘is the right of personal con-
templation.”’

Student reaction to the convocation
was mixed. Senior Eric Cooper said
he thought the administration was
“trying to appease our class.’’ He

Library displays signatures

 

From Staff Reports

 

In celebration of the 200th anniver-
sary of the U.S. Constitution, the
Washingtoa and Lee University
Library is exhibiting a collection of
autographs of the 39 signers of the
Constitution.

The autograph collection is on loan
to the university from Susan Coblentz
Lane of Altavista, Va., whose father,
the late Rev. David Coblentz, col-
lected the autographs between 1952
and 1976. Rev. Coblentz served as the
minister at New Providence Pres-
byterian Church in Rockbridge Coun-
ty. Lane, whose husband, Douglas B.
Lane, is a 1979 W&L graduate, work-
ed in W&L’s McCormick Library
from 1976 to 1979.

Of the 55 delegates who attended
the Constitutional Convention 200
years ago, only 39 actually signed the
Constitution. The autographs of the

39 signers which Coblentz collected
appear on various documents in-
cluding personal letters, land titles,
governmental appointments and ac-
count books. All of the autographs
are in mint condition.

The self-guided exhibit is enhanced
by interesting biographical data and
engravings from portraits of the
signers. The exhibit is located in the
Boatwright Room of the library,
which is open Monday through Fri-
day from 9a.m.-5 p.m.

As a supplement to the Coblentz
autograph collection exhibit, an ex-
hibit of materials from the universi-
ty’s collection on James Madison,
“The Father of the Constitution,’ is
is on display in the main lobby of the
library. This exhibit inclides books,
manuscripts, and other materials
about the signers of the Constitution.
The exhibits, which are open to the
public, will be on display through
December.

Polo boots Army

 

By Hunter Catlett
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee water polo is
back and springing into the national
polls.

After an impressive 4-0 start at the
W&L Fall Classic, the Generals have
been ranked 19th in the latest Divi-
sion I national polls and fifth on the
East Coast.

The Generals return almost every-
one from a team that finished 21-11
and was considered one of the top 30
teams in the country last year.

“The team is virtually the same as
last year’s, but they are much im-
proved, much more consistent,”’ said
eighth-year head coach Paige
Remillard.

Remillard credits much of his
team’s improvement and consisten-
cy to their off-season work.

“Our team worked hard over the
summer, with a couple of our players
going to Southern California to play,”
said Remillard.

The Generals’ hard work paid off,

as they cruised to four impressive
victories in the tournament. The
team opened the classic on Friday
with a 24-5 shellacking of Lynchburg.
W&l played two games on Saturday,
defeating Dayton 22-11 in the morn-
ing and whalloping UNC-Wilmington
18-2 in the nightcap. These games set
the stage for the showdown with 20th-
ranked Army on Sunday.

This would be somethin
grudge match, as Army
W&L in overtime last year.

The Generals exploded out of the
blocks against Army with sophomore
Martin Bulingame scoring just 14
seconds into the game. The Generals
scored twice more before Army
could get on the scoreboard, and the
first period ended with W&L leading
3-1.

Momentum wore off during a
penalty-plagued 2nd period, and Ar-
my stormed back to tie the score at
five-all. Senior Simon Perez and
junior David Dietz both scored on
penalty shots during the last two
minutes of the period to give the
Generals a 7-5 halftime lead.

Soccer loses opener

 

By Gary McCullough
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee men’s
soccer season opened up yesterday
on Smith Field against Shenandoah,
and it was the Generals coming up on
the short end of the scoreboard with a
4-1 loss.

W&L came into the game under a
definite disadvantage, in that
Shenandoah had already played five
games this season.

“The whole team looked a little
sloppy,”’ said senior and co-captain
Chuck Lyle. Lyle shook off the notion
that the game being W&L’s first was
any excuse. He said the team was
confident going into the match, but
just wound up being out-hustled.

The lone goal was scored by
Patrick Brown, but it was the defense
that was somewhat suspect. Last
season, the defense helped then
junior goaltender Chris Gareis
establish a school record in career
shutouts.

The Generals will have to straigh-
ten out a few defensive problems
quickly. W&L’s next chance to get
back to its winning ways will be on

Saturday when the team travels to
Greensboro.

 

 

 

In fall of 1986 the Washington and
Lee men’s soccer team made them-
selves well known throughout the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference as the
team to be reckoned with. Defeating
eleven teams and suffering only four
losses, W&L had little difficulty cap-
turing the ODAC championship
Fortunately for the other teams in
the NCAA Division III tournament,
W&L was not extended a post-season
playoff bid.

The 1986 season will definitely be
difficult to match. There are 27
players on the team after the last
round of cuts on Saturday, including
seven freshmen. However, the team
lost three very strong players to
graduation—Pete Van Son, Jimmy
Tucker, and Tommy Pee.

Head coach Rolf Piranian, though
very optimistic about the season,
showed concern about the Generals
depth. ‘his is the first freshman
class we don’t have any starters,”
Piranian said. Although there is
great talent among the freshmen,
some of the finer points will take time
to develop

The second half belonged com-
pletely to W&L. The team roared out
to three straight goals to start the
third period and never looked back.
The Generals led 10-6 at the end of
three and continued to pull away in
the fourth period. The Generals led
14-7 with two and a half left when the
starters were pulled and held on for a
14-9 victory.

Dietz and junior David Reavy led a
balanced attack with five and three
goals, respectively. Balance was
one of the reasons for the Generals
‘success. Junior Moose Herring said,
“We have no one superstar. You
can’t stop just one person, or five
others will kill you.”

The Generals will need all of their
skill and balanced scoring this
weekend at the New England Varsity
Invitational if they are to hold onto
their national ranking. This tourna-
ment has the top-eight teams on the
East Coast competing.

The Generals will open against No.
3 Bucknell and, if W&L wins that

match, the team could become a fix-
ture in the National Polls this year.

head coach Gary Fallon as he enters
his tenth season at W&L are mostly
focused on the offense. Can the
Generals recover from the loss of
nine starters, including quarterback
John Thornton, a two-year starter,
and runningback Kevin Weaver, who
set six school records and rushed for
over 2400 yards in his career?

At least three sophomores were in

the running for the starting job at
quarterback — Phil Sampson, John
Durant, and Chris Smythe — as well
as junior Tony Waskiewicz. But
Fallon has settled on Sampson (6-2,
190) as the starter. Last year, Samp-
son saw virtually no playing time
—he completed one of two passes for
nine yards — but he has shown the
ability to perform under pressure: in
his first college track meet, Sampson
shattered the school record in the
pole vault.

Senior Chris Coffland (5-11, 170) is
expected to take over Weaver’s role
as W&L’s offensive workhorse. Cof-
fland finished third on the team in
rushing yardage in 1986 while also
returning punts and kickoffs, but
Fallon says he hopes to allow Cof-
fland to concentrate on tailback this
season. The rest of the starting
backfield will include seniors John
Roe (5-10, 175) at slot and sophomore
Russ Crosby (5-9, 195) at fullback.

 

Wide receiver returns

Haven't I seen him before?”’

Sometime during the first quarter of Saturday’s W&L football game,
opposing coach Lou Wacker of Emory & Henry probably looked out at
the W&L offense and wondered, ‘‘Who is that guy? That number 17...

Well, coach, the answer is yes, you have seen him before. Number 17

Law student Hugh Finkelstein
(5-10, 178), W&L’s leading receiver in
1985, returns at spilt-end. Senior Gar
Prebor (6-0, 180) will start at tight
end.

The offensive front is anchored by
all-American tackle John Packett.
“The Mountain’’ is listed at 6-4, 280,
but coach Fallon confesses that his
weight probably won’t dip below 300
anytime soon. As the Roanoke Times
and World News observed, this
lineman can really ‘‘Packett in’’ at
dinnertime. Bob Drake (6-2, 245), a
second team all-ODAC selection,
returns at offensive tackle. Juniors
David Surface (6-3, 215) and Julian
Phillips (6-1, 210) will start at the two
guard positions, and junior Rowan
Taylor (6-1, 215) will take over as
starting center.

Coordinator Chuck O’Connell’s 4-3
defense features the same backfield
as 1986, with senior Jeff Harwood
(5-10, 170) and sophomore Robert

Rimmer (5-10, 170) at the corners
and seniors Tom Donahoo (5-11, 165)
and Mark Oluvic (5-10, 170) at the two
safety positions. These four W&L
deep men combined for seven in-
terceptions in 1987, with Rimmer
pulling in four.

Sophomore Mike Pack (5-11, 190)
and junior Tom Skeen (5-10, 205),
W&L’s leading tacklers in 1986,
return as starting linebackers, with
junior Bill Crabill (5-11, 190) at the
other linebacker position. The front
four will feature seniors Jay
Gorlowski (5-10, 220), a returning
starter, at one tackle and Fred Skin-
ner (5-9, 225) at the other. Junior Jim
Johnson (6-2, 240) will once again
start at defensive end, and
sophomore Tripp Guillford (6-2, 205)
will be at the other end.

Skeen will once again punt for the
Generals, and the only freshman to
nail down a starting position will be
kicker Carter Quayle (6-1, 181).

E&H Wasps sting

Generals,

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

Literally and figuratively, there
were few bright spots in W&L’s foot-
ball season opener Saturday. The
Generals were trounced by the
Wasps of Emory and Henry, 42-19,
but the rain-soaked game really
wasn’t even that close. Other than
some surprisingly good passing by
sophomore quarterback Phil Samp-
son, a first-time starter, the Generals
had a miserable day in miserable
weather in Emory, Virginia. Head
coach Gary Fallon is certainly not
alone in saying, ‘‘I sure hope they’re
one of the better teams we’ll play all
year.”

Check out the numbers—the Wasps
abused W&L in first downs (34-14)
and total offense (588-205). Emory
and Henry was supposed to rely on its
passing game more this season than
in 1986, when their offense featured
all-America tailback Sandy Rogers.
Nevertheless, the Wasps.rushed for a
total of 400 yards last Saturday, 89 of
them on 10 carries by junior Jamie
Cassell. In fact, four E&H runn-
ingbacks out-rushed the entire W&L
offense, which managed only 35
rushing yards on 27 attempts.

The Emory and Henry passing
game was just as good as the running
game, if not better. Starting QB Gary
Collier threw two incompletions and
then completed his next 12 attempts

42-19

for 170 yards and two touchdowns
before leaving the game in the third
quarter; he also rushed for 26 yards
and two TD’s of his own. The number
one passer in Division III last year,
Collier shows no signs of letting up in
1987.

W&L’s young quarterbacks did not
look good by comparison, but FalloA
has no reason to be disappointed,
Sampson completed 11 of 23 passes
for 144 yards and two touchdowns‘
said Fallon, ‘‘we thought he held his
own and really did an outstanding
job.” Sampson’s first touchdown
pass as a collegian came with 1:42
left in the first quarter, when he hit
senior John Roe with a 16-yarder; the
sophomore QB’s other scoring pass
was to law student Hugh Finkelstein
from 35 yards out with 9:45 remailr-
ing in the fourth.

»

Sampson’s replacement, sop-
homore Chris Smythe, completed
three of five passes for 26 yards and
one TD, a 14-yard pass to sophomore
Robert Martin. “He .came through
with the things that need to be done,”’
said Fallon of Smythe. ‘‘We’re pleas-
ed that he’s in there in that back- “up
role”

The return of Hugh Finkelstein to
W&L football probably wasn’t the,

first-year law student’s most en
joyable game, but he did show spark

is Hugh Finkelstein, a 1986 graduate of Washington and Lee, the owner
of a 4.6 time in the forty, a winner of two varsity football letters, and
W&L’s leading receiver in 1985. As a senior, he caught 35 passes for 515
yards and two touchdowns.

Yes, Hugh Finkelstein, the man who gave opposing defensive backs
nightmares in 1985, is back at W&L. You see, an injury kept him off the
football team as a freshman. Thus, when he returned to Lexington to
study law last month, he was carrying a year of football eligibility
along with his W&L diploma.

“Coach Fallon approached me about playing again, and football was
already in the back of my mind,” said Finkelstein. Washington and
Lee petitioned the NCAA, the NCAA said it was OK, and suddenly
Finkelstein is back at wide receiver for the Generals.

As you might imagine, trying to balance the demands of law school
and intercollegiate football isn’t the easiest way to spend a semester.
“So far, so good,” says Finkelstein. ‘‘It’s been straight from practice
to studying. On Saturdays, I study after games, and then go out later
on if I can.”’

And what has the man who caught a 52-yard pass against Maryville
been doing since graduation? The 1985 Generals’ leading receiver
tried out for the St. Louis Cardinals...the baseball Cardinals, that is.
Finkelstein played baseball as well as football during his
undergraduate years at W&L. In fact, he batted .440 as a junior. But,
fortunately for Gary Fallon and friends, Finkelstein wasn’t awarded a
contract by the Redbirds. And instead of trying out for the football
Cardinals, he’s back at W&L, studying law and giving nightmares to a
whole new group of defensive backs.

Women’s soccer makes change to varsity

 

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee women’s
soccer team has made the final step
up to the top platform.

Under the tutelage of men’s head
soccer coach Rolf Piranian, the
women’s team has been a develop-
mental sport for the past two spring

seasons. This fall, however, the

 

Preview

women’s team is ready to show that
it deserves varsity status.

This season, Janine Hathorn is the

 

head coach of the formidable group
of twenty-nine women soccer
players. The demanding practices
reduced the number of women who
tried out for the squad to those with
the highest level of interest and skill.
Hathorn stressed that both these
elements are essential to the success
and unity of the team. “I have great
expectations for the returning
sophomores and juniors because of
their experience,”’ Hathorn said. “I
am also confident in the progress of
the freshmen, as well as appreciative
of the amount of support and eager-
ness they contribute to the team.”
Hathorn is particularly impressed by
the tremendous effort and en-
thusiasm displayed by each squad
member despite rigorous practices.
The training is more difficult this
year to ensure that a high level of

competition can be attained.

The roster shows a good represen-
tation from each class, including Outi
Maeupaa, an exchange student from
Finalnd. Captains Laurel Mattson
and Liz Smith are juniors, along with
Lucy Anderson, Amy Balfour, Cathy
Boardman, Catherine Christian,

Catherine Council, Stephanie Lake,
Ann Large, Eleanor Nelson, Besty
Parkins, Alexa Salzman, and Tracy
Williams. The seven sophomore
players are Sarah Allen, Catherine
Baillio, Holly Gooding, Linda
Jackson, Mary Alice McMorrow,
Courtney Simmons, and Beth Stutz-

man. Representing the freshman
class are Cary Baber, Sherri Brown,
Ginger Gay, Kate Hanley, Paige
Kilian, JuLee Messerich, and
Rachelle Nock. With two weeks still
remaining before the first game,
Hathorn is not able to speculate
about the starting line-up.

Some thoughts on sports reporting

 

Shades on sports
By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

Last year we ran into a slight problem. I say ‘‘we” as in the
‘reporters for The Ring-tum Phi and the other students here at
Washington and Lee. What happened was not pleasant. A sports
reporter for The Phi, after writing an unfavorable story on an athletic
contest, was physically threatened by a few members of the athletic
team. It’s not important to know the names of the people or the team
involved. It is, however, important to analyze why the incident oc-
curred.

First let me throw out a question to you: What is the purpose of a
newspaper reporter? Well, in my opinion, a reporter’s job is to write
down the facts of an event and present them in an unbiased and
coherent story. Unbiased is the key word here, as an objective view-
point is crucial in order to allow the reader to make his or her own
judgments on the content of the story.

This formula is fine for most straight-forward news stories. But a
problem arises when the story is not so straight forward, such as a
sports story. Sure, a sports reporter could just write a basic simple
story telling the score, giving a chronological order of the game and
showing individual and team statistics, but this would be boring.
Sports Illustrated brags about how you can ‘‘get the feeling” when you
read their stories. Much of the same idea holds true when reporters
cover sporting events for newspapers, be it The Phi, The Washington
Post or The Richmond Times-Dispatch. The reporter has to go beyond
the retelling of the event and provide some ANALYSIS of the game.
Did the team come out flat? Why did the coach bench so-and-so? Were
they just beaten by a superior team or did they have an off day? Sud-
denly, that objectivé story has become a subjective one with the
reporter’s insights and opinions being added.

Okay, so now we have the mental approach | a sports réporter takes
when covering an athletic event. But there is much more to it than
that. A reporter for The Post writes a much different story than a
reporter for The Phi. Why? For one thing, a Post reporter has more
experience, more resources and a different audience. The Post is a
major daily newspaper in the United States and has a circulation of
millions, while The Phi is just a small weekly newspaper for a small
liberal arts college in Virginia and has a circulation of roughly 2,500. A
Post reporter can be more critical and take more chances when
writing a story because he/she has strong organizational backing.

 

 

 

 

Also, a Post reporter does not see at lunch in the dining hall the next
day the athlete he just criticized in the papers. Some doors might be
closed the next time around, but a Post reporter doesn’t have to worry
about facing that athlete in a D-hour class.

Which leads into another problem. Since the reporters for The Phi
are students, many of the athletes they are writing about are their
friends. Do you report the story the way you saw it or do you jeopar-
dize a good friendship? Believe it or not, The Phi is not out to nail
anybody to the wall. No one wants W&L teams to lose. If I could, I
would print only positive aspects of the W&L athletic programs. But
then, I wouldn’t be putting out a journalistically-sound newspaper and
I wouldn’t be serving you as readers.

So let’s look back at what caused the problem. Some athletes took
exception to a story printed in the Phi because they felt it didn’t ac-
curately portray what really happened in the game. An understan-
dable situation, but the athletes acted immaturely by threatening the
student-reporter with violence. The solutions? Well, first of all, the
athletes here at W&L are going to have to learn how to accept
criticism. When you're an athelte, that’s what comes with the ter-
ritory.

I think another answer would be for the athletes to realize that we
reporters are full-time students, just like you. As a reporter, you just
don’t always have the time to double-check the facts. We are also
human, so mistakes (mainly stupid ones) will be made. I remember
last year The Phi identified Robert Rimmer of the football team as a
senior when he was really a freshman. An incredibly dumb error and
one that should have been avoided, but, hey, I can remember even
dumber mistakes I have made in my lifetime.

For the reporters, I think obtaining quotes from the PLAYERS and
not just the coaches would establish a better working relationship with
the team. Give the people involved a chance to explain themselves and
express what they feel happened. Also, watch the games. Follow the
sport with some interest. Your story sounds so much better if you
know the intricacies of the team.

Hopefully, there will be no problems similar to last year’s. I’m look-
ing forward to the 1987-88 athletic season. And please, keep in mind
what’s been said here. I think everything will go much smoother if you
do.

NOTES — God, say it ain’t so! Those pesky New York Mets are back in
contention. If the Mets win the National League East, I’ll promise to
take my sunglassess off for the following week’s column. I’ve got my
fingers crossed... Hats off to CBS for it’s coverage of the U.S. Open.
Pat Summerall, Tony Trabert and John Newcombe were all outstand-

best athletes, according to Fallon,
Finkelstein pulled in four Sampson
passes for 66 yards, including the 35-
yard touchdown toss late in the
game.

It would be a gross understatement
to say the W&L defense had a rough
afternoon. Despite causing six
fumbles and recovering five, the
Generals simply couldn’t get around
the physically larger Wasp offensive
line. Together, the Emory and Henry
front players average almost 230

Words In Edgewise

The Ring-tum Phi, September 17, 1987

Bakkerscam - The Final Chapter

By Marshall Boswell
Staff Reporter

Now that the hoopla, for the most
part at least, has long since come to
pass, it is time, I think, to look at one
last, but vitally important, aspect of
the recent Jim and Tammy Bakker
phenomenon.

The question of whether or not
“religious television’’ is what it says
it is (sure it’s television, but is it
“religious?’’) has been examined so
thoroughly that my merely bringing
the subject up has probably already
caused you to look around desperate-
ly for something large and unyielding
to throw through a window. The term
“religious television’’ is, at the very
least, a bad oxymoron: this we all
know. And the Jim and Tammy af-
fair has no doubt caused You Know
Who more sleepless milleniums than
most of us mortals could ever ap-
preciate.

But isn’t it true that nearly every
child in these United States watches
television ‘‘religiously?” We may not
all have a personal relationship
with God, and a great many of us
may have been blissfully spared the
embarrassment of being counted
among Jim and Tammy’s close ac-
quaintances, but we all know one
thing in common: we all know
television—many of us ‘‘religiously.”’
And as far as telaesthetics go, the
PTL Club was absolutely sublime
tube.

Let’s be honest here: Everybody, it

seems, has an opinion on the PTL
Club—that it was corrupt, a lie, a
malignant tumor on the face of
Christianity—and, well, most of
these opinions, I might venture, were
more often than not right on the
mark. But how many of us actually
ever watched the show?

I, for one, did. Back in the B.C.
years (‘before cable’) Jim and
Tammy broadcasted their twisted lit-
tle slab of devout weirdness from
deep in that frightening forest known
as Late Night Weekend Television. A
quick spin of the dial at 2:00 a.m. ona
Friday night might yield a poorly-
dubbed martial arts movie, a two
hour long episode of ‘‘Mannix”’ and a
telethon for African famine relief.
And in the midst of all this came
“The PTL Club’ — an hour’s worth
of late night viewing that had a pro-
found affect on me as an adolescent.

Jim and Tammy had the basic re-
ligious television premise: There
was what looked like a living room,
with a couch and a coffee table, win-
dows and decorative furnishings, all
of which were situated on a raised
stage and surrounded by a studio
audience. Guests sat around the cof-
fee table and gave religious testi-
monials, perhaps did a bit of singing,
and then left the stars of the show
alone to give the Pitch. But Jim and
Tammy were different.

my were hopelessly and hysterically
tasteless.

Jim and
Tammy were special. Jim and Tam-

For starters, there was simply too
much furniture — too many plants,
too many vases, too many couches.
The whole thing looked, it has been
said, like a discount furniture
showroom. And, my God, the guests
Jim and Tammy invited: Christian
New Wave hair dressers, Christian
dwarf unicycle teams, Christian gar-
bage men, Christian flame swallow-
ers. Jim and Tammy weren't the
Johnny Carson of religious televi-
sion. They weren’t even Merv Grif-
fith. They were probably closer to be-
ing David Lettermans — only Jim
and Tammy meant it.

And then there was the audience.
There they would be, Jim and
Tammy’s multitude, clapping empti-
ly like those poor souls who have to
attend the Saturday afternoon film-
ing of your local TV station’s studio
wrestling broadcast. But again, the
difference here was that this aud-
ience loved it. The question is, where
did this crew come from? Teenage
kids with ‘‘punk” haircuts, senior
citizen couples in lime green
polyester jumpsuits and matching
dribble cups, two hundred and
eighty-five pound fathers decked out
in sagging Wragler jeans and black
“Chevvy!’’ T-shirts. The PTL
faithful. Jim and Tammy’s flock.

But lastly there was Jim and Tam-
my. Jerry Falwell is a politician,
Robert Schuller is a pop psycholo-
gist, and Jim Swaggert is a misguid-
ed meglomaniac; but Jim and Tam-

R.E.M. pens “‘Document”’

By Greg Unger
Music Critic

Document, R.E.M.’s 7th album, is
certainly no surprise. It seems in fact
that every September we can expect
to hear from Athen’s Ga.’s finest as
they bring us the latest edition of
their bi-annual musical master-
pieces. Their latest effort is no dissa-
pointment, bringing with it the abili-
ty to sound better every time you
hear it; which should be quite often.
There is, however, one sole fault.
Though good, the songs sound rather
similar-almost forcing you to listen

repeatedly just to dissemble and
recognize the different songs.

A few tracks stand out, however.
Document opens strongly with “The
Finest Worksong’’—a slightly harsh-
er R.E.M. tune than usual, yet one of
the most powerful songs on the ‘‘A’”’
side. Songs No. 2 and No. 4 are
nothing special, but sandwiched be-
tween them is “Exhuming McCar-
thy” an interesting song with more
than decent lyrics and a pleasant
overall feel. ‘‘Strange’’ follows
“Disturbance at Heron House’’ and
along with “King of Birds’’
resembels the most memorable

PARENTS
ALUMNI

songs off Life’s Rich Pageant.
“Lightnin Hopkins” is the bright
spot of Document’s ‘‘B”’ side, with a
good drum effort and catchy chorus
sung by the rest of the guys. By the
way, Michael Stipe’s voice remains
distinct throughout the album, and it
seems that R.E.M. has matured into
what they’re always going to be. In-
deed, Docment seems comfortable
following Dead Letter Office and

my were celebrities, It is probably
not too far-fetched to imagine them
as a husband and wife country music
act. They would have been huge. Now
everybody has said it, but I'll say it
again: Jim had boyish good looks.
The guy was forty and still looked
like that kid in your high school class
with mayonnaise-smeared braces
and terrible acne. But Jim was a pro-
fessional. He had a certain slickness
about him, an admirable flair for
showmanship, that kept him from be-
ing a just a worthless joke. None of
this mattered, of course, because
Jim also had Tammy Faye. She
didn’t seem like she could be real: all
that makeup, those horrendous
clothes, the tears and the stomach-
churning melodrama. Certainly she
wasn’t to be taken seriously. Just
when Jim would get on a roll, asking
for pledges, praying for the Christian
dwarf unicycle team, whatever,
Tammy would break in, that shrill
dissonant voice coming through like
a stray radio signal. And Jim would
shoot her the Look — a sincerely
pissed-off husband stare that implied
in no uncertain terms for her to Shut
Up. They were as good as Lucille Ball
and Ricky Ricardo — but again, the
difference was that they meant it.
This was real domestic tension —
how could they have orchestrated it
all? And if they did, then they were
much more clever than anybody has
given them credit for being.
Too bad you missed it all.
