Two W&L students are putting
together a panel discussion group
to discuss current and controversial
issues.

Saying that Contact is not pro-
viding enough opportunities to en-
rich student’s knowledge of cur-
rent events, and that it does not
offer enough interaction, John
Falk, ’90 law, and Bob Tompkins,
*89, are forming the group.

The panel discussions will in-
volve faculty and students from
both the law and undergraduate
schools.

The group’s format will be a
short presentation from each of the
five or six panel members of their
opinions. A moderator will run the
discussion, with the audience free
to pose questions and express opin-
ions.

Said John Falk, ‘‘The real pur-

pose is to encourage active debate
on substantive issues. ”’

The debates will try to give the
students both sides of the issue.

 

 

Students to form
discussion group

Panel members will be selected for
their opposing points of view.

One of the benefits of the group
would be its flexible format. Ac-
cording to Falk, it would be able to
meet in any of the various auditor-
iums or lecture halls, depending on
demand. And, according to Tomp-
kins, it would be virtually free.

““We don’t plan to bring in
anyone with large honorariums.
We can do it all in-house. ”’

The two plan to organize ‘‘con-
sistent and continual forums’’ on
current and controversial issues.

They are currently planning a
contra aid panel for early March,
with Professors Herrick, Parker, a
legislative assistant for Senator
McKane (R., Ariz.), and Professor
Geimer from the Law School.

An exact date for the event has
not been set yet.

According to Tompkins, ‘‘We
have talked to the politics depart-
ment, the journalism department,
the faculty, and members of the
administration. We have a good
base of support. Our primary task
now is the generation of student in-
terest.”’

Ladies and Gentlemen of Washing
ton and Lee, welcome to the Recon-
ciliation Ball of 1865; the 81st annual
Fancy Dress Ball.

Since the origin of our little get-
together in 1907, Fancy Dress has
grown into what has been called ‘‘the
largest collegiate social event in the
nation.’’ This year will be no excep-
tion.

The festivities will officially kick-
off Wednesday night at 9 p.m. when
the MTV-renowned Boneshakers
come to Lexington to rock the General
Headquarters.

Thursday night offers a triple con-
cert at the Student Activities Pavilion
with three bands from the Progressive
Music breeding ground of the
South—Athens, Georgia. Pinocchio
Nose, Drivin’ & Cryin’, and Love
Tractor will start up about 8 p.m. and
promise to put on a long and exciting
show.

Wednesday and Thursday nights are
fun, but Friday night is enchanting.
The Fancy Dress Ball—a night of an-
ticipation, expectation and realization
of hopes, dreams and fantasies; a
night of unique memories for anyone
who experiences it.

As you and your date approach the
red-carpeted stairs leading to the
Warner Center entrance to the past, a

Election petitions due

 

By Jon Ryan
Staff Reporter

 

Elections for Executive Committee
offices are just around the corner.

Petitions for the ‘‘Big Three’’ of-
fices—president, vice- president, and
secretary—were available Tuesday in
Carol Calkins offie. Candidates need
150 signatures by Monday.

The elections for the ‘*Big Three’’
will be held March 7, with the run-
offs on March 10.

The EC decided to allow short spee-
ches from each candidate as well as

requiring answers to set questions dur-
ing the open forum for candidates in
Lee Chapel on March |.

Elections for undergraduate rep-
resentatives and class officers will be
held Monday, March 21. Law school
election dates are still to be announ-
ced,

In other EC news, the EC froze the
accounts of two clubs.

The funds of the Fencing and
Squash clubs were frozen after no rep-
resentatives from the clubs appeared
at a budget review hearing. The EC
voted to hold their money until they
met with club representatives.

lining the stairs will introduce you to
the Reconciliation Ball. Inside the
doorway a buggy in front of a back-
ground of newspaper front pages and
blown-up posters from the Civil War
will meet you.

The Warner Center, decorated like
the Southern countryside on one side
and Northern city on the other, will
act as an elegant ballroom while the
sounds of the Glenn Miller Orchestra
sweep the almost four thousand people
expected for Fancy Dress off of their
feet. The Orchestra’s repertoire con-
tains over 1700 songs, and it promises
to be a wonderful evening of musical
enchantment.

The wall behind the Orchestra will
be covered with gray paper with a
blue border and will showcase the 36
state flags from the states in existence
in 1865. On the opposite wall, where
the stairs lead up to the 500-level of
the Warner Center there will be a two-
story mansion complete with columns
and trees covered with Spanish moss.

While the Glenn Miller Orchestra
swings in the Warner Center, Dore-
mus Gymnasium will be doing some
rocking of its own.

The Doremus Gymnasium will be
decorated like a Paddlewheel river-
boat with the paddlewheel coming out
of the wall by the athletic administra-
tive offices. On the other side of the
gym, Indecision will start cranking
out some serious rock and roll some-
time after 9 p.m. After they have
warmed up the stage sufficiently,
Marshall Crenshaw, the headline rock
act for the Reconciliation Ball of
1865, will hit the stage.

 

This year’s ball promises to be on
of the best Fancy Dress Ball's in re
cent memory. A small fireworks dis
play will open the ball, and then a
much larger one will conclude the ball
sometime after | a.m.. The fireworks
are not the only revival,
This year’s invitation will specify the
dress as Black Tie or appropriate cos
tume.

however

One of the most appealing things
about the Reconciliation Ball of 1865
theme was the potential of bringing
back costumes. The earliest Fancy
Dress Balls were all costume parties,
and later, costume balls. With this
year’s theme, the SAB not only wan
ted to emphasize the tradition of
Washington and Lee and the signifi
cance the Civil War played on shaping
our university, but they also wanted to
bring back one of our oldest tra
ditions: costumes at Fancy Dress

There have been some questions
about the nature of the theme from the
administration and there may be some
from the Student Body, but the SAB
urges everyone to keep in mind that
Fancy Dress is a social event, not a
political one.

The SAB has put in over a thousand
hours in preparation for this year’s
Fancy Dress and more than anything
wants everyone who goes to have a
happy, safe and memorable Fancy

. Dress.

Ladies and Gentlemen of Washing
ton and Lee, I present to you, the 81st
annual Fancy Dress Ball; The Recon
ciliation Ball of 1865. To the ballroom
we go.

Mock Convention comes close in primaries;
correctly predicts Gephardt and Dukakis

 

By Heidi Read
Staff Reporter

 

 

 

Washington and Lee’s Mock De-
mocratic Convention correctly predic-
ted the three front-runners in the lowa
caucus, although in a slightly different
order.

The results of the Feb. 8 Iowa cau-
cus put Rep. Richard Gephardt
(D-Mo.) and Sen. Paul Simon (D-III.)
in a close race for the lead, with Mas-
sachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis
close behind.

According to the Washington Post,

Law students not banned from Gaines Hall

 

By Jon Ryan
Staff Reporter

 

‘*Law students banned from Gaines
Hall’’ was the front page headline of
the Feb. 11 issue of the W&L Law
News.

A misunderstanding apparently oc-
curred between Washington Hall and
the Law School regarding the adminis-
tration’s housing policy on Gaines
Hall as it applies to law students.

According to Dean of Students
Lewis John, housing applications
were sent to the law school and the
administration never heard back, so
they assumed no law students wanted
to live in Gaines.

According to EC Representative
David Nave, the housing applications
sat on the circulation desk in the law
school until near deadline, when peo-
ple started asking about them.

Assistant Dean Kenneth Ruscio said
residents of Gaines Hall, including the
law students there, will get first choice
of staying there.

John said that he knew of only two
law students who re- applied to live in
Gaines, and no new applications.

‘*The only people we wrote to were
current residents of Gaines,”’ said
John.

Ruscio said he would like to hear
what the housing wants of law stu
dents are.

**T wouldn’t want to use law stu
dents in a way they don’t want to be
used,’’ although he would like to use
housing to help close the gap between
law students and undergraduates.

John said he had the feeling that law
students wanted to live by themselves
for a variety of reasons, citing
different interests and undergraduate
noise as two of the factors.

Next year the East building of
Woods Creek will be exclusively law
housing. The central building might
be exclusively law if there is enough
demand, said John.

John said he felt the law students
preferred this arrangement, especially
with the kitchens in Woods Creek,
since law students might not want to
eat in the undergraduate cafeteria

The future of law student housing in
Gaines is still up in the air. According
to John, Gaines was built primarily as
undergraduate housing, although that
does not preclude law students from
living there.

Currently there is a waiting list for
Gaines next year

The administration will use the resi-
dent advisors in Gaines to plan pro-
grams and activities for halls, accord-
ing to John.

According to Nave, the application
form for Gaines looked as though the
administration is trying to set up halls

with “‘themes,’* such as French
majors is One section, and similar
things

John expressed the sentiment that
law students might not want to join in
these activities and themes, although
some might.

lhe future plans are still being dis
cussed

‘I would like to determine if there
is a demand [for law students in
Gaines], and if there is, then we can
construct a policy for responding to
that demand,”* Ruscio said.

the remaining four candidates, former
Arizona governor Bruce Babbitt, The
Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, former
Colorado Senator Gary Hart and Sen.
Albert Gore, Jr., (D-Tenn.) were
running well behind the other three.

The Iowa caucus forecasts by the
W&L Mock Convention predicted
that Gephardt would lead at 24 per-
cent, Dukakis would be in second
place with 18.9 percent and Simon
would follow closely behind him with
17.4 percent of the vote. The W&L
Towa delegation predicted that the re-
maining candidates Babbitt, Jackson,
Hart and Gore would follow in that
order.

Before the caucus on Feb. 8, Iowa

state chairman Bill Madox said, ‘‘The
last round of Gephardt advertisements
seems to have broken things open.”
Sam Conner, chairman of the creden-
tials committee, said, ‘‘Dukakis still
has the twin benefits of a good organi-
zation and plenty of financial support.
Simon will have to rely on his favorite
son appeal and his endorsement in the
Des Moines Register if he is to im-
prove his position.’

According to the Washington Post,
both Simon and Gephardt were rely-
ing on their status as *‘favorite neigh-
bors’’ to win in Iowa.

The W&L Mock Convention also
correctly predicted that Dukakis
would win the majority of the vote in

New Hampshire. The primary fore
casts predicted that Dukakis will wit
42 percent of the vote. Simon, at |‘
percent, was expected to have a sligh
edge over Gephardt’s 16 percent. The
remaining Mock Convention predic
tions stated that the other candidate:
will follow in the order: Jackson. ‘
percent; Gore, 6 percent; Hart, 4 per
cent; and Babbitt, 2 percent

Dukakis won the New Hampshir
primary with 37 percent of the vote
Gephardt followed with 21! percent
and Simon received 18 percent. The
rest of the results were as follows
Jackson, 8 percent; Gore, 7 percent
Babbitt, 5 percent; Hart, 4 percent

OPINION
Theme

With the announcement of this year’s Fancy Dress theme, The
Reconciliation Ball of 1865, controversy already seems to be upon
us. The Minority Student Association, in a letter to the editor this
week, has announced its plans to boycott Washington and Lee’s
biggest social event of the year. This in itself, even if it only affects
attendance slightly, will cast a pall over the event.

Although we do not support the MSA’s planned boycott, we do
understand why they are upset with the theme. It does seem a bit
callous to choose a theme that will alienate an important section of
the student body. The MSA is correct in this: Fancy Dress is for the
entire student body.

If the Student Activities Board wanted a Fancy Dress with an
American theme, surely they could have arrived at something more
suitable for everyone. The Jazz Age would be a good example. One
of the purpose behind Fancy Dress, it seems, is to pick a theme that
deals with something that is not familiar to the university commun-
ity, something a little bit exotic.

We live the Southern way of life every day. It surrounds us in
everything we do. Look at Lee Chapel, the Honor System, the
friendly nature of the students. Because of this, we ask: why have a
theme that is, primarily, southern? It seems like overkill to us.

Still, we can’t endorse the MSA’s decision to boycott, We have
not seen the actual ball as of yet. Although the potential for prob-
lems exists, we believe the SAB will handle the theme tastefully,
and the ball will be a good time for everyone.

We encourage the MSA to reconsider their boycott. If, when they
attend the ball, they find it to be insulting, they should leave and
demand their money back. This way an unnecessary problem can be
avoided.

Forum

A forum is in the planning for a discussion of current and con-
troversial issues. The student organizers, John Falk and Bob
Tompkins, have decided to organize the forum because Contact is
not doing enough to keep the student body in touch with current
events.

Whether or not their claim is true, it is good to see students taking
the initiative in correcting what they see as a problem. In the light of
student apathy, often discussed in this paper, it is refreshing to see
students taking action.

The proposed forum will be debate style and panel members will
be selected for opposing points of view. With audience participa-
tion, this plan promises to be both exciting and informative. Finally
students will be able to do more than just listen to a authority speak-
ing on a topic; they will be able to discuss, argue and learn on topics
that affect everyone.

Of course, the forum will not work if students do not make the
effort to participate. We encourage students to give their support to
the committee in order to ensure its success. Perhaps this will be a
good first step to increased student involvement and awareness.

Get ready

Big Three election time is rolling around, and soon students will
be faced with the task of electing the representatives for next year’s
Executive Committee, and thereby shaping the course of student
life and the Honor System. Candidates for president, vice-president
or secretary need to have their petitions turned in by Monday.

There will be an open forum for candidates on March 1 in Lee
Chapel. Each candidate will be allowed to make a short speech and
answer questions. This is an important function in the election.

W&L students need to be well-informed before they cast a ballot
in the election. When electing students as the administrators of the
Honor System, we should be cautious. We encourage all students to
attend the open forum and listen closely. And most of all, be ready
to vote. If one does not vote, one can not complain about those who
are elected.

Faculty

actions
on frats

By Lewis G. John
Dean of Students

 

I wish to take this opportunity to
make some observations about frater-
nity Rush and pledging, and specifica-
lly to correct some misunde: i
about the action taken by the faculty at
its Feb. 1 meeting.

Contrary to the lead paragraph of
the Ring-tum Phi’s front- page story
on Feb. 4 and the implications of the
editorial of that same issue, the faculty
did not ‘‘take the Interfraternity
Council out of the Rush scheduling
process.’’ The faculty simply left
interim responsibility for fraternity
Rush and pledging—interim, in the
sense of the next couple of years,
prior to the availability of the results
of the self-study exploration of all
facets of the freshman year—just
where it has been, with the Student
Affairs Committee.

The process by which the Student
Affairs Committee determines, in the
words of the faculty motion,
‘*whatever improvements in fraternity
Rush and pledging it deems appro-
priate is left to SAC. It must take into
consideration faculty sentiment, and it
certainly will continue to take into
consideration IFC and student senti-
ment on these matters.’’ As a matter’
of fact, the IFC has already submitted
a proposal for next year to SAC, and I
am sure that it will have other recom-
mendations. This does not mean that
SAC will automatically accept any
and all IFC proposals (as some frater-
nity leaders might wish), but it does
mean that the IFC continues to have
its input, just as it has in recent years.

I would also take issue with Tommy
McBride’s contention (in his letter to
the editor in the Feb. 11 issue) that
many of the members of SAC are
‘*not qualified to vote on the issue.”’
Decisions about Rush and pledging, as
well as about fraternity life in general,
have implications for all of the Uni-
versity community and its many con-
stituencies, not just for those male
students who are members of fraterni-
ties. The Board of Trustees has dele-
gated authority for student life and the
governance of student organizations,
including fraternities, to the faculty,
which has in turn delegated that au-
thority to the Student Affairs Commit-
tee, half of whose voting members are
students. In approaching these issues,
we must be concerned for the Univer-
sity as a whole, including what should
be the primary concern for all of
us—academics.

I shall leave discussion of the sub-
stantive issues raised by the Phi editor-
ial for another time, but I would dis-
agree that the SAC proposal is ‘‘dang-
erously misguided.’’ Many of us be-
lieve that significant reform is needed
not so much in the Rush schedule as in
pledging practices, and that is the
reason that the SAC plan for next year
proposes changes in the timing and
length of the pledge period.

Registration terrifying experience ,

 

MY VIEW
By Margaret Pimblett

 

As I returned to campus after
February Break, I was in good spirits.
I had enjoyed the vacation, slept a lot,
done absolutely no schoolwork,
visited the radio station where I'll
have my summer internship, and met
some fascinating new people, all
within the space of one week.

Life was relatively stable, although
I knew I had plenty of work to do once
I returned to Lexington.

But I knew I could handle it.

I’m used to dealing with a busy
schedule.

But then, I realized what always
happened on the Monday after Febru-
ary Break.

Spring Term Registration.

It started Monday morning, just
after 9 a.m. I’d been awake since 5:30
because I’d done a radio show, and for
someone who usually crawls out of
bed at 9:37 for a 10:00 class and man-
ages to shower, wash and dry hair,
and get dressed and still get to class on
time, a Monday morning schedule like
that is not the easiest to bear.

This time was particularly difficult
because I did the show alone. My
partner had the chance to sleep in, be-
cause I had managed to forget to do
the show the week before break

(sorry, my bad).

So I had just survived three hours of
grudging wakefulness when I hap-
pened to glance at a W&L Weekly Ca-

any student, who already knows what
classes to take and just need to get that
professor’s signature for permission
to be in the class.

If registration frightens someone
who has that much foresight, imagine
how heart-wrenching it is for someone
who hasn’t thought about courses, and
who looks over the class listing only to
find that any class the student is possi-
bly interested in meets at D hour.
Every day of the week.

Doesn’t sound so bad at first. Class
at 11:00, have some lunch, then spend
the afternoon lounging at Goshen or
Panther Falls.

The problem occurs when you real-
ize you really ought to be taking six
credits to keep up with your gradua-
tion plans, and your second choice
class meets at CD, Monday and Wed-
nesday. Okay, so you won’t be able to
take that one after all. There must be
some other course which doesn’t con-
flict. Hmmmmm.... Oh, here’s an in-

LETTERS

1988 Fancy Dress to be boycotted

teresting one. Religion 381, Seminar
in Apocalyptic Literature. But it meets
CD, Tuesdays and Thursdays. ’

Ah, how about Contemporary Is-
sues in Child Development? A good *
idea for any students who expect to be ,
having children sometime during their
lifetimes. When is it scheduled? Mon- *
days through Thursdays, CD hour. ,
There’s still a conflict.

Well, I'll find a three-credit course ‘
in a minute. Let’s look iat finding a
P.E. class. Takes five to graduate, and
spring’s a great term to be out-of- ‘
doors

Skills in Golf could be fun. Doesn’t |
Coach Leslie teach that? At CD, on *
Mondays and Wednesdays or Tues- ;
days and Thursdays. One more try...

Well, I could try to get into horse-
manship, it’s an arranged class sched-
ule. With my luck, by the time I get to
the gym at 9 a.m. on the morning the
juniors are supposed to register, the
class will already be filled with
seniors and the underclassmen who
went in on Monday afternoon to get
the class they wanted.

And I’m still looking for one more
three-credit class. Maybe by this time
next week I'll have figured something
out. How about Math 256, Calculus
IV? It meets FG, MTTHF, so I could
schedule that in. But I don’t have the
prerequisites. Anybody know when
organic chemistry class is scheduled?

 

To the Editor: We, the members of the Minor-
ity Student Association of Washington and Lee
University find this year’s theme of Fancy Dress
to be an insult to us all. Do the members of SAB
actually think that the black students at this uni-
versity can enjoy Fancy Dress when its theme is to
be set in a period in which blacks were oppressed?

We understood before coming to Washington
and Lee that there was a low percentage of black
students; however, we believed that our contribu-
tions to this institution--ranging from the Execu-
tive Committee, Student Recruitment, and dorm
counselors, to our participation in intercollegiate
sports--would serve as a positive symbol of our
love and dedication for this school.

How can we remain positive and help to im-
prove the retention rate of black students and help
with the recruitment of black students of future
classes if we are shown nothing other than a bla-
tant disregard for our achievements? We can’t.
We had no idea that the sixth oldest school in the
nation is also the most racist.

To Mr. Thomas O’Brien, we ask, ‘‘If you want
to attend and Old South party, why don’t you at-
tend the one sponsored by the fraternity?‘

We feel that Fancy Dress should be a celebra-
tion for everyone. Therefore, we, the Minority
Student Association of Washington and Lee,
choose to boycott this year’s Fancy Dress Ball.

More Lip Sync praise

To The Editor:

W&L’s Second Annual Lip Synch Contest for
Multiple Sclerosis was a terrific success. The con-
testants, contributing businesses, audience and

especially the organizer—Jerry Darrell, should be
lauded for their outstanding efforts.

Over $800 was raised during the lip synch
contest. These funds will be used to provide ser-
vices to over 850 people who have MS in the Blue
Ridge Chapter’s area. In addition the funds raised
will be utilized by the National Multiple Sclerosis
Society to further biomedical research in finding a
cause, cure and better treatments of multiple
sclerosis.

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, often dis-
abling disease of the central nervous system of
young adults between the ages of 20 and 40. Its
symptoms can run the gamut from slight blurring
of vision or numbness in the extremities to com-
plete paralysis. About one quarter of a million
Americans have multiple sclerosis, with nearly
200 new cases diagnosed every single week.

On over 200 campuses around the country col-
lege students like yourselves have organized Stu-
dents Against Multiple Sclerosis (SAMS) cam-
paigns to raise money and awareness for the fight
to ‘‘short circuit’? MS. A video tape of the Fiji
house’s winning rendition of the Village People’s
*“YMCA”’ will be judged against those of other
SAMS campuses holding a ‘‘Rock Alike’’ lip
synch contest. The top six performers in the coun-
try will appear on a nationally broadcast Rock
Alike Finals from Daytona Beach, Florida on
MTV: Music Television.

Thank you again for helping in the fight against
multiple sclerosis.

or $3 for senior citizens and
non-W&L students.

When Ruth Laredo made her debut
with the New York Philharmonic, The
New York Times called her ‘‘the pre-
sent generation’s first truly major
American woman pianist.’’ A most
versatile artist, Laredo has given per-
formances at Carnegie Hall, Alice Tu-
lly Hall, The Kennedy Center and the
White House. She has appeared with
the symphony orchestras of Philadel-
phia, Boston, Cleveland, St. Louis,
Detroit, Baltimore, Houston, Indiana-
polis, Buffalo and with the National
and American Symphonies.

A three-time Grammy nominee,
Laredo has received particular success
with her historic recordings of works
by Rachmaninoff, Scriabin and Ravel.
She is the first person ever t6 have 're-
corded Rathmaninoff’s complete solo
piano works, a five-year project for
CBS Records which produced a series
of seven discs. She has made recent
recordings of Beethoven, Chopin,
Debussy, Tchaikovsky, and Proko-
fiev.

Laredo studied piano with Rudolf
Serkin at the Curtis Institute and made
her New York orchestral debut under
Leopold Stowkowski. In 1984, she
was selected as the special guest sol-
oist at the gala Carnegie Hall Ameri-
can Symphony Orchestra concert
making the centennial of the famed
conductor’s birth.

School. The following year, she was
invited by Leonard Bernstein to be a
soloist with the New York Philhar-
monic. When she gave her New York
recital debut under the auspices of
Young Concert Artists, The New York
Times wrote, ‘‘music bursts from her
as naturally as leaves from trees.”’

In 1966, Robison became the first
American to win first prize at the
Geneva International Competition.
Since then, she has become one of the
world’s foremost wind soloists, ap-
pearing with orchestras and in recitals
in major concert halls in the U.S.,
Canada, Europe and Japan.

Robison has been profiled by CBS
Television’s ‘‘Sunday Morning,’’ The
New York Times, Musical America,
People, Virtuoso, and Ovation maga-
zines. She has performed on telev-
ision’s ‘‘Live from Lincoln Center,”’
‘Christmas at the Kennedy Center,”’
**The Today Show,’’ and ‘‘The To-
night Show.’’ She is a founding mem-
ber of the Chamber Music Society of
Lincoln Center, and with her hus-
band, noted violist Scott Nickrenz, is
co-director of Chamber Music at the
Spoleto Festivals in Italy, Charleston,
S.C., and Melbourne, Australia.

~Women win
ODAC title

r

’

'

t

 

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

 

A picture-perfect performance was
turned in last weekend by the W&L
women’s swim team.

The Generals, playing host to the
combined Old Dominion Athletic
Conference and Atlantic States
Championship meet, defeated favored
Sweet Briar 620.5-580.5 to win the
ODAC title and to become the first
women’s team in W&L history to win
a conference championship.

But that was not all. The team also
produced over a dozen other outstand-
ing achievements. Nine school re-
cords were broken. Junior Elizabeth
Miles won all her events and was
named ODAC Swimmer-of-the-Year
as well as Atlantic States woman
Swimmer-of- the-Meet. Miles and
freshman Sharon Coleman qualified
for the NCAA Division III National
Championships, and every swimmer
achieved her season-goal time.

‘“*The women’s performance was
just short of a miracle,”’ said head
coach Page Remillard. ‘‘They were

not going to be denied. Their goal was
to be the first W&L women’s team to
win the ODAC championship. The
key was their tenacity. The swimmers
were actually mean about it. That was
not a week to get in their way.”

Remillard referred to the race he
thought epitomized the determination
factor at the meet. Coleman and her
Sweet Briar opponent were neck and
neck throughout the 200-yard butter-
fly event until Coleman just barely
pulled ahead at the finish. Each
swimmer managed to qualify for
nationals with their times—a totally
unexpected result. The competition
was So fierce it forced both women to
achieve their career-best times.

Freshman Rachelle Nock’s perfor-
mance in the 200-yard breaststroke
also exemplified W&L’s de-
termination and supports Remillard’s
choice of the word ‘‘miracle’’ as an
appropriate description of the meet.
Nock cut nine seconds off her best
time for that event—an achievement
Remillard called ‘‘unheard of.”’

‘*This was our best weekend ever,”’

Swimming claims Atlantic States crown, Regionals next

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

In the wake of the incredible per-
formance turned in by the women’s
swim team, the W&L men’s swim
team certainly had no reason to feel
ashamed of its effort last weekend in
Cy Twombly Pool.

All the Generals did was go out and
crush Glassboro and Mary Washing-
ton to win the Atlantic States cham-
pionship. In the process, three more
swimmers qualified for the NCAA
Division III National Championships
and several swimmers swam the best
races of their lives.

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

Led‘ by sophomore pole vaulter
Phil Sampson, the Washington and
Lee indoor track team completed
its invitational schedule over the
February break and is preparing
for the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference Championship meet,
set for Saturday afternoon at the
VMI Field House.

Sampson finished third at the
Virginia Intercollegiate Indoor
Track Championships in Blacks-
burg by clearing 15 feet, the qual-
ifying height for the Division If
national championships. So far,
Sampson is the only W&L athlete
to qualify for the March 12 event.

Sampson broke his school record
of 14-6 after tying it twice earlier
in the season.

A 15-foot performance Saturday
should be enough to give W&L a
win in the ODAC pole vault com-
petition, according to head coach
Norris Aldridge, who said most of

 

“It was an outstanding meet,”’ said
head coach Page Remillard, who was
selected as the Atlantic States Men’s
Coach- of-the-Year. ‘‘Including the
women, out of 34 people who had es-
tablished goal times, 33 bettered their
goal times.”’

Team-wise, W&L cruised by its
opposition, scoring 447 points com-
pared to Glassboro’s 316 and Mary
Washington’s 118. Individually
speaking, the Generals got some
excellent showings from three swim-
mers in particular. Junior Moose Her-
ring and sophomore Adam Morgan
qualified for the NCAAs by breaking
the D- Ill qualifying standard in the
400-yard individual medley. Not to be

the other vaulters in the conference
have only cleared 13-6.

In the high jump, junior Fray
McCormick returns to defend his
1987 ODAC title, with ‘personal
best of 6-4 in 1988.

But victories by Sampson and
McCormick will not be enough to
give W&L the school’s fifth
straight indoor title. ‘‘If we win it,
it’s going to come on the running
events,’’ said Aldridge.

The Generals will no doubt look
to senior hurdler Andrew White
for some key points. One of the
team’s captains, White is averag-
ing well under eight seconds in the
55-meter high hurdles and was the
ODAC Runner-of-the-Year in in-
door and outdoor track in 1987.

In the distance events, Aldridge
expects good performances from
senior Scott Rippeon, who is ap-
proaching the nine-minute mark in
the 3000 meters, and junior Jamie
Urso, who ran the 800 in 2:01 at
the VMI Relays and should per-
form well on that same track Sat-
urday.

qualified for the NCAAs and broke °

the school record in the 200-yard
breaststroke. Sophomore David Olson
has already qualified for the cham-
pionships earlier in the season.

“It was a quality meet. It was an
exciting meet,’’ said Remillard.
‘*Everyone responded. All the things
we were saying all year long hap-
pened.”’

The Generals travelled to Emory
University to compete in the NCAA
Regional Championships that begin
today and run through Saturday.
W&L will not only attempt to qualify
more swimmers for nationals, but also
try to improve some of its swimmers

 

 

 

 

Phil Sampson

 

 

 

‘“‘We’re not trying to get a trip to
Atlanta,”’ said Remillard. ‘‘We’re try-
ing to go down and represent the uni-
versity and score points and come
back with a place at nationals.”’

Remillard also commented on the
reasons for shaving some swimmers,
while holding off on others until re-
gionals or nationals (swimmers shave
off most of their body hair in order to
swim faster times). In the case of Ol-
son, who qualified unshaven earlier,
Remillard said Olson would shave for
regionals to help improve his seeding
in nationals three weeks later (March

17- 19).

“Our plan with David Olson is to
shave him at Atlanta and then come
back three weeks later and go faster,”’
said Remillard. ‘‘There are so many
different things—it’s very complex.
We treat everyone physiologically
differently.”’

Remillard would not mention
names, but he thought the Generals
would qualify at least two more
swimmers for the NCAAs at the re-
gionals. However, as a team, W&L
will be hurt by the absence of the
swimmers who have already qualified
and are remaining in Lexington.

Roanoke
ends hoop
season

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

 

The W&L basketball team’s season,
which had been on the skids the past
two weeks, came to a crashing halt on
Tuesday night when the Generals lost
a nail-biter to the Roanoke College
Maroons 83- 81 in the first round of
the Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence tournament.

The loss was the Generals’ fifth in a
row—seventh out of their last eight
games—and capped a stretch during
which W&L saw its 15-3 record dissi-
pate to 16-10. There were no excuses.
The team just didn’t play good basket-
ball in the month of February.

But the Generals did redeem them-
selves with their showing against
Roanoke on Tuesday night at the Bast
Center in Salem, Va. The Maroons
came into the ballgame with a 21-0 re-
cord in ODAC tournament play
(Roanoke has won the conference
tournament every year it’s been held)
and seven-consecutive conference
championships. The Maroons had
momentum, having come from behind
in the conference standings to tie
W&L for fourth place and, with all
other tie-breaking criteria even, win
the coin toss for the home-court ad-
vantage in the first round.

But W&L would not go down eas-
ily. The Generals’ strategy was
simple—pound the ball inside to
senior center Harmon Harden and
freshman forward Chris Jacobs to ex-
pose Roanoke’s lack of defense in the
paint. The strategy worked beautifully
as the Generals, behind 14 points by

Grapplers fail to qualify, finish at 5-9

By Jim Linza
Staff Reporter

 

The Wék, wrestling season came to
an end last weekend at the NCAA
Eastern Regional Championships,
held at New York University in New
York City.

The Generals failed to qualify any
wrestlers for the NCAA Division II
Nationals which will be held March
2-5 at Wheaton, Maryland.

W&L’s top finisher was senior co-
captain Steve Castle who placed
fourth at 118 pounds. Based on his
performance, Castle stands as the
alternate for his weight class in the
NCAA tournament.

Junior Manoli Loupassi was W&L’s
second-best finisher, placing fifth at
190 pounds.

W&L swept its two matches at the
Davidson Triangular to complete its
regular season with a dual-match re-
cord of 5-9»

The Generals beat Furmian 30-24
behind a number of strong performan-
ces. Senior John Lowe and sophomore
Lee Garlove both won by decision at
134 pounds and 150 pounds, respec-
tively. Senior co-captains Castle (126
pounds) and Kevin McNamara (177
pounds) notched pins for the Generals
while wrestling up in weight class
from their usual slots. McNamara’s
victory sealed the win over the Purple
Paladins.

W&L was aided by four forfeits and
one default which accounted for 30 of
the Generals’ total points as they
breezed by host Davidson 38-13.

‘‘We played around with the lineup
and wrestled well,’’ said head coach

Gary Franke. ‘‘It was a nice way to
end the regular season.”’

Much of the reason for the 5-9 re-
cord was the injuries and illnesses the
grapplers suffered during the year.

There were a few bright spots dur-
ing the season. Although not their
toughest match (benefitted by six wins
by forfeit), W&L smashed Ferrum
59-0 to establish a new school record
for margin of victory in a dual match.
It should be noted that a perfect score
is 60-0.

Franke was also quick to point to
the work of his seniors who finished
their collegiate careers at W&L.
Castle finished the season at 19-4-1,
Lowe at 15-5 and McNamara at 14-6.
Two other senior starters will be lost
to graduation—Greg Russell and Jay
Gorlowski.

second half started ominously

1» W&L. After a James Pennix dunk,
Roanoke went on a short spurt and the
Genet themselves on the
short end of an 11-point differential.
Roanoke was going almost exclu-
to junior guard Patrick Mul-

and he was coming off
s to bury open jumpers. Mul-
downey would lead all scorers with
6, but W&L hung tough.

Where were we in February?”
said head coach Verne Canfield of the
Generals’ patience on offense. ‘‘Why
couldn't we do it then? It’s a classic
example. We had some key people
vho didn’t play up to their already
sstablished standards. Yet if we
played with intensity and played
together and played within the frame-
work that we felt was best for us, we
can play with anybody.”’

Canfield was alluding to the Gen-
inability to work the offense
during the losing streak before Tues-
day night and comparing it with the
comeback they made against the Mar-
oons. Patiently passing the ball around
the perimeter, W&L time and time
gain found Harden inside for easy
points. The lead dwindled to six, then
to four and then to two points with
oO even minutes remaining. Har-
den would finish with 24 points and
the game was back and forth, nip and
tuck, the rest of the way.

Roanoke went up by four with
under two minutes to go and the Gen-
erals seemed to be in trouble. Senior
guard Steve Hancock, the team’s lead-
ing scorer, was having an off night (5
for 17 shooting, 12 points) and W&L
had had trouble in the past playing

long happened.””

   

with composure in a tight ballgame

The Generals cut the lead to two and
then got the ball back with 30 seconds
showing on the game clock. It was do
or-die time for W&L

“I was very proud of the kids, ex
cept at the end there,”’ said Canfield
““Why didn’t we go inside like you
were supposed to. We didn't. Michael
[Holton] wanted the shot, Michael
took the shot."

Holton took a tough 17-footer with
six seconds left and the ball bounced
off the front rim. Senior center Lou
Trosch tracked the loose ball down in
the right corner, but he was forced to
throw up an off-balanced jumper. The
ball hit the side of the backboard as the
buzzer sounded and the Generals had
been eliminated in the first round of
the tournament for the second-straight
year.

“T hated to end the season on a bad
note,’* said Canfield. “* Yet there was
something positive about it, because
we came back.”’

What wasn’t positive were the four
games W&L lost before post-season
play even began. On Thursday, Feb.
ll, the Generals travelled to Mary
Washington and got trounced 86-73.
W&L played horribly on the boards,
being outrebounded 46-26. Mary
Washington took a 42-32 halftime
lead and were never seriously
threatened after that. Hancock led the
Generals with 18 points and freshman
forward Ed Hart chipped in 14.

That led into Roanoke-W&L Game
No. 2 at Roanoke on Saturday. The
Generals shot a miserable 39 percent
from the floor and the Maroons pulled
away late enroute to a 85-76 victory.
The Generals could still clinch the
fourth-place slot with a win on the
road against either Eastern Mennonite
or Maryville. It was not to be.

The Generals visited the E-M
Royals on Tuesday, Feb. 16 and lost
at the buzzer 74-73. E-M lit up the
baskets, shooting 62 percent for the
game (72 percent in the second half),
including 3-3 from three-point range,
as the Generals blew a 15-point lead.
Eugene Baltimore, who assisted on
the winning basket, burned W&L’s

defense for 25 points. Hart’s 20 and

Remillard explained that the team
focused on winning the championship
this season, a different strategy from
last year’s concentration on an un-
defeated dual-meet season.

“They had one thing on their
minds. The team had given up so
much time over each vacation that
they couldn’t afford to make mis-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Senior center Harmon Harden goes up for two of his 24 points in

Tuesday’s loss to Roanoke.

Harden’s 16 were the offense for the
Generals.

Maryville on Thursday night gave
no friendlier welcome. The Scots,
who seem to save their best for W&L
steamrolled over the Generals 98-75.
Holton led all scorers with 21 points
(five three-pointers) but Maryville had
six players score in double figures and
the Scots never looked back after soar-
ing out to a 49-38 halftime lead.

The season, which had such promis-
ing beginnings, did have some bright
spots. The Generals knocked off
Bridgewater, then ranked No. 4 in the
nation in Division II, and Roanoke in
the Warner Center before a _near-
capacity crowd. But the final month
was so disastrous, especially with the

takes,”’ he said. ‘‘And they didn’t.”’

The women ended with an accom-
plishment that surpassed everyone’s
expectations. Remillard had final
words of praise.

“Every goal was reached—a very
rare occurrence in sports. Hardly any
team accomplishes all it intends to do.

high expectations brought about by the
fast start.

One person who did not fail to live
up to expectations was Hancock. The
senior co-captain was the General's
leading scorer, averaging ~7.6 points
per game. He was also the team’s
fourth- leading rebounder, first in
minutes played, first in steals and first
in assists. He also finished as W&L’s
12th most prolific scorer in history
with 1215 career points. For his out
standing achievements, Hancock was
named by the opposing coaches to the
first team all-ODAC squad and, prob
ably even more impressive, to the
National Association of Basketball
Coaches South-Atlantic All-District
First Team.

But the W&L women did.”’

The team travelled to Emory Uni-
versity to compete in the NCAA Re-
gional Championships, which are be
ing held today through Saturday. The
Generals go into the meet attempting
to add even more NCAA national qua-
lifiers.
