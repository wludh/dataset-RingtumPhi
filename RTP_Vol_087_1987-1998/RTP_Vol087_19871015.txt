‘University outlines measures to improve frat houses

New regulations and the results of
an architectural survey may force
W&L fraternity houses to do some
housekeeping.

Last Thursday a Fraternity Steer-
ing Committee introduced new
supervisory measures to all the
fraternities. The eight page docu-
ment is the work of a Fraternity
Committee composed of Alumni,
trustees, students, faculty and ad-
ministration.

The report outlines various aspects
of fraternity business, from main-
taining an annual budget to the ap-
pearance of the fraternity house, giv-
ing responsibilities to the University,

the Interfraternity council, the na-
tional fraternities, the house corpora-
tions, local chapters, and the chapter
house.

The regulations reinforce the com-
mitment of the University to the
fraternity system by repeating,
“social fraternities are a valuable
and integral part of both the Univer-
sity and Lexington communities.”

This statement “keeps in the
spirit’ with the Board of Trustees
May 25, 1985 ‘Policy Statement
Relating to Campus Life.’’ The coun-
cil again reiterated the ‘‘spirit’’ of
these reports, however, by stating
that fraternities “have important
privileges as well as responsibilities
to those communities.”

The “responsibilities” cover all
aspects of fraternity life, but the
most visible will be changes to the

The decomposed remains of a
homicide victim found by Virginia
highway workers May 27 have led to
the arrest of a Texas man, but the
identity of the victim has left in-
vestigators scratching their heads.

The body was found over the bank
of the southbound lane of Interstate
81 near exit 50 south of Lexington. In-
vestigators say the man had been
shot in the stomach or chest area
with a revolver-type weapon on or
about May 19, 1987.

John Stephen Swartz, a 35-year-old
truckdriver from Channel View,
Texas was arrested Aug. 15 in Texas
and charged with the murder. Swartz

" was extradited by Commonwealth’s

'

.

Attorney, Eric Lee Sisler.

Swartz picked the man up at a
truckstop somewhere in Virginia, ac-
cording to Lonnie Craft, a Special
Agent of the Bureau of Criminal In-
vestigation in Salem. Craft said

evidence found on the body and vehi-
cle identification led them to Swartz.

Swartz aided investigators in com-
piling a sketch of the victim, who he
described as a white male, approx-
imately 21 years of age, 5 feet 4 inch-
es tall with brown hair. The victim’s
identity is still under investigation.

The man used the name Chris, ac-
cording to Swartz, who said the vic-
tim was seeking work as a lumberer
and was planning a hike, possibly on
the Appalachian Trail. Swartz said
the victim had mentioned being in
the military, and said he was wear-
ing military issue eyeglasses, an Ar-
my shirt, loafers and a brown coat.

Swartz has been charged with first-
degree murder and the use of a fire-
arm in commission of a felony.

The criminal record of the accused
is not yet known, according to Sisler,
who said the records have not yet
come through the Criminal Record
Exchange because of a delay in pro-
cessing. :

A preliminary hearing is set for
Oct. 30 in Rockbridge county General
District Court.

local houses themselves

The code requires certain by-laws
such as forbidding drug use, defining
the role of officers, guidelines for
alcohol use, prohibiting firearms,
academic achievement, and so on.

The houses are subject to physical
standards alone. For instance,
fraternity appearance must ensure
that it “is compatible with the
neighborhood. Kept in good condition
at all times. Has landscaped grounds
conforming to a_ professionally
designed landscape plan approved as
part of its renovation plan.

“The list includes fire safety,
building codes, a party room with
sound absorption capability, and
good dining and kitchen areas.”

In short, the fraternity must

“Provide bed and bath facilities of a
quality at least equal to the best

residence hall accommodations pro-
vided by the university.”’

Currently, a Charlottesville ar-
chitectural firm is surveying the
fraternities to determine the
feasibility and expense of the frater-
nities meeting the University re-
quirements.

This survey consists of a ninety
minute interview with the officers of
all fraternities, and should be finish-
ed before Thanksgiving. Upon re-
ceiving the report, it is the job of the
trustees to, in Dean Atkin’s words,
“allow funds to be procured in some
way.”

The University’s guidelines are not
meant to hinder the fraternity sys-
tem, Dean Atkins stated, ‘‘because
we know the importance of frater-
nities. We just want to have the best
ones around.”

Catherine Christian made history
Saturday afternoon as the first
Washington and Lee undergraduate
to be crowned homecoming queen
—although only moments before be-
ing crowned, she was busy playing
soccer for the women’s soccer team.

All this, yet Christian seems to be
pretty low-key about it all.

“Of course, I didn’t expect to win,”
she said matter-of-factly. “I was
very flattered, not to mention very
lucky.”

Christian, a native of Chapel Hill,
North Carolina, said she was asked
by Phi Delta Theta the week before
homecoming to be their represen-
tative.

“I then got a letter from the
Homecoming Committee informing
me about the interview to be held the

At tonight’s meeting, said Londrey,

7 p.m. in Lee Chapel.

Londrey explained that the
meeting was established to give
freshmen a better idea of whom
they’re voting for. So often it’s been
based upon word of mouth, It’s our
objective to make the freshman class

more involved than in the past.’’

The stiffest area of competition is
the race for EC representative, in
which there are fifteen candidates.

To reach the voters, candidates
have been busy putting up posters
and handing out leaflets and
resumes. Most have been doing their
best to meet as many people as possi-
ble, and a few have even gone from
door to door in the dorms.

Some freshmen are having a hard
time deciding which candidates to
choose.

Freshman Trey McClendon com-
mented, ‘‘It’s a popularity contest.”

Freshman Eric Harlan said, “It’s
similiar to Rush in that you are not
given the oppurtunity to get a good
look at all the possibilities. Options
are limited to the few you know.”’

Londrey noted that, “The fresh-
men who really take an initiative will
stand out.”

Freshman Willard Dumas said,
“The important thing is everyone
getting out and participating in the
election.”

The polls will be open from 9 a.m.
-4 p.m. on Monday. Ballot boxes will
be located in the Davis and Graham-
Lees quads and in the ODK Circle.

This year’s Voting Regulations
Board is making an attempt to get
freshmen involved in their class
elections by sponsoring a fresh-
men class meeting to get the
freshmen familiar with the
canidates.

Bill Londrey, VRB Chairman,
says the idea of holding the forum
in Lee Chapel at 7 p.m. tonight is a
great one.

“Even if the candidates don’t
say anything meaningful, it’s a
chance for freshmen to connect
names with faces. Hopefully,

 

some people will take advantage
of the meeting and say something
relevant and the cream will rise to
the top,” said Londrey.

VRB Vice-Chairman June-Ho
Lee said the meeting should
become an annual tradition.

“Freshmen candidates will
have to introduce themselves to
the whole freshmen class. Thus,
the freshmen class will be able to
see the candidates’ faces rather
than just names on the ballot,”
Lee said.

“We're hoping the whole
freshmen class will show up.
We've stressed the importance of
it. We're hoping for a good turn-
out,”’ Lee added.

Londrey said high attendance at

the meeting would be a sign of in-
terest among the freshmen class.

“Tt’s not apathy, but a lack of in-
formation that causes low voter
turnout,”’ stressed Londrey, who
said he hopes the meeting will
take care of that problem.

Besides sponsoring class meet-
ings, such as the one tonight, the
VRB has been working to
eliminate problems that have
plagued past elections—such as
misspelled or missing names on
ballots.

A sample ballot was posted on
the Executive Committee door for
candidates to check the spelling of
their names earlier this week.
Londrey said this has been helpful
in reducing the number of com-

plaints by candidates.

“Every year there are com-
plaints,’’ Londrey said, “but we
leave it up to the candidates to
make sure [names] are correct.” |

“This year freshmen have two
days to correct misspelled names
on the ballot. This is to make sure |
everyone’s name is on the ballot
and spelled correctly,’’ said Lee. |

“One problem we are trying to
avoid is a lack of voters,’ Lee ad- |
ded. |

Londrey said he would be happy
with any voter turnout above 70
percent.

Londrey said the VRB would be
spending $70 on this election,
which will be held Monday, Oc-

W&L hires a new security officer

 

By Marguerite Ayers
Staff Reporter

 

With more girls at Washington and
Lee University these days, more
campus housing to attend to and
complaints of strangers being on the
grounds of the university, W&L will
have a new full-time security guard
starting Oct. 19th to oversee the
dorms at night.

‘We figured we needed someone
close around the dorms at night to
check on things and quickly respond
to complaints, especially where the
girls are,’’ said Charles ‘‘Murph’’
Murray, the University Proctor.

Horace ‘‘Hew’’ Blair will be the
new man for the nightime shift. He
has done security work in Lexington
for Willow Springs Apartmens and
local hotels

There have been complaints from
campus” residents involving
strangers hanging around campus,

including a man seen on the trail bet-
ween Woods Creek Apart: cits and
the library two weeks ago.

“T was walking to class at about
10:45, I think it was a Monday, and
this man on the path said hell,’’ said
Julie Salerno, a resident of Woods
Creek Apartments. “Then after he
passed, he mumbled something
about me,”’ she said.

“T didn’t think much of it until my
roomate, Julie Snowdon, said she had
seen the same man on the path an
hour before I did, so obviously he
wasn’t just out for a walk. That's
when we decided to call security,”’
Salerno said.

Murph said he found the man two
days later near the back of the
library and told him he shouldn’t be
there and asked him to leave.

Salerno said she had another pro-
blem two Sunday nights ago when
she ran into a stranger near the front
library entrance who said he wanted
to show her something. She said she
quickly left.

According to Murph, the man later
approached Rob Powley near the
library and showed him a knife.

Powley called W&L Security, who
called the Lexington Police. The man
was arrested and charged with
public drunkenness and carrying a
concealed weapon

Despite occasional security pro
blems, most girls say they feel safe

on campus.

When asked how safe she thinks
things are on campus, Margaret
Pimblett responded by saying
“very.”

Patsy Sciutto said she feels very
safe, ‘‘except for late at night.”

“T feel safe on campus, but walking
around Lexington at night is kind of
scary,’’ said Caroline Carter

Maggie Allison said the only thing
that scares her around the dorms are
the tractors. Unfortunately W&L sec
nrity responds only to unlocked
doors, fire alarms and unwanted
strangers
OPINION
Improvement

With the fraternity renaissance program, Washington and
Lee is beginning to bring the fraternity system to a level of
excellence equal to its size. The Fraternity House Renovation
Program, which was presented at last weekend’s House Cor-
poration Conference, would result in fraternity houses that
reflect the quality of the university.

For a fraternity system the size of W&L’s, it’s amazing that
the fraternity houses in general are in such bad condition.
The problem is not that students do not want to live in the

 

. houses. The problem is the inside, and often outside, of the

fraternities is an eyesore.

For a university with buildings that are registered as na-
tional historic landmarks, one would expect that all buildings
connected with the university would fit the scheme of things.
Of course not all of the academic buildings are structures of
pure beauty, but at least the university maintains them and
keeps them in the best possible condition.

The proposal made at last weekend’s conference could
result in a dramatic renovation of most of the fraternities at
W&L. Everyone involved in this proposal needs to make all
the effort required to ensure that the renovation eventually
takes place.

The building of a separate basement party room in each
house is an idea whose time has really come at W&L. Not on-
ly will it make parties easier for the fraternities to control, it
will make it easier for the fraternities to actually have par-
ties. Lessening the risk of noise violations and such would
allow the fraternities to do more of what they want in the way
of partying.

It seems obvious that this program would be beneficial to
all involved. Therefore, the fraternities and the administra-
tion must work together to make it a reality. It would be a
shame for the program to collapse because of lack of par-
ticipation on anyone’s part.

immature

Washington and Lee is a place that purports to represent
the best of the college gentlemen and women. Students show
this to the world through our honor code, polite conduct to
visitors and the friendly atmosphere on campus.

If this is the case, why are the elevator doors in the Univer-
sity Library covered with grafitti? Just a quick glance at the
doors tells the reader how some fraternities feel about each
other or what some students think of certain individuals. The
doors seem to function like a newspaper along the lines of
The Weekly World News or National Enquirer.

It is a sad comment on the entire university when a few
people are apparantly compelled to comment on current
events (or dredge up old ones, as the case may be) on the in-
side of an elevator door. Think of any prospective student
who comes to visit W&L. He or she has been told the wonders
of the honor system, and how this campus is a perfect exam-
ple of how such a system should work. Should they believe all
they have been told when they read in the elevator that some
people who were found innocent are ‘‘guilty”’ or a ‘‘b....’’?

Those people who think it necessary to deface university
property to let their opinion be known need to learn what
courage is. Courage is not putting anonymous comments
around campus. If you do not believe in your opinion enough
to put your name on it, then your opinion is worth nothing.

There are ways to voice discontent at W&L. Talk to a
member of the administration who deals with the problem in
question. Write a letter to The Ring-tum Phi, or write a My
View column. In any case, let the community know who is
voicing the opinion. Otherwise, no one can take it for more
than what it is: juvenile scribbling by cowardly students.

Policy

All editorials which appear in The Ring-tum Phi are the
opinion of the newspaper, excepting those which are im-
mediately followed by initials of one of the members of the
editorial board. In that case the editorial is the opinion of the
member whose initials are listed. The members of the board
are Marie Dunne (MED), David Emrich (JDE) and Sean
Bugg (WSB).

All My View and other columns that appear in the Phi are
the opinion of the authors, and do not necessarily represent
the view of the newspaper or its editorial staff.

The Phi welcomes letters from its readers commenting on
the paper and the subjects it covers. All letters must be
received by 5 p.m. Tuesday to be printed in the next issue.
Although we attempt to print every letter received, some let-
ters may not be printed due to space limitations. We also
reserve the right to edit any letters for length. We will not
publish any letters which we deem libelous or obscene.

‘Apathy’ works well
with water polo team — Snozkin

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

One part of the Ring-tum Phi that I
have found particularly interesting is
the “Talkback” because reading the
opinions of fellow students and facul-
ty m@mbers is usually entertaining.
Unfortunately, I have to admit I was
a little perplexed by one of the topics,
‘What do you think about Athletic
Apathy?’’ The word apathy just
seemed to abstract; my high school
newspaper tended to use words like
good, bad, hot, and cold. Overwhelm-
ed with curiosity I decided to for-
mulate my own definition by watch-
ing the crowd during a weekend
water polo tournament. My reasons
for choosing Polo were simple: I play
on the team and, more importantly, I
spend enough time on the bench to
accurately assess the crowd. We
played well enough to advance to the
finals on Sunday, beating four teams
including top ranked University of
Richmond. Our opponent turned out
to be a skilled team from Arkansas
comprised mainly of foreign
recruits.

From my bench seat the stands
seemed to be mostly full. Arkansas
got off to a seven-point lead early in
the first period. We were having a lit-
tle trouble adjusting to their style but
managed to cut the lead to five by the
end of the first half. The crowd seem-
ed to have grown a little bigger and
by the start of the 2nd half, no one left
despite the fact that we were behind.

I wondered if this was ‘‘Athletic
Apathy,”’ but decided to reserve
judgment till later. We started the
second half with two quick goals that
brought us within three and activated
the crowd; which grew louder on
every counter attack. The W&L
players answered the cheers with in-
tense, inspiration play and the crowd
got even noisier. We scored again.
The crowd was now ina wild frenzy. I
would have trouble describing the
fans at this point, but they certainly
didn’t didn’t look apathetic.
Adrenalin permeated the air as
Arkansas pulled ahead and we slowly
fought back with the help of the
crowd. Finally we came within one
point on a spectacujar goal which
erupted the crowd into patriotic
chaos. I observed loyal faculty
members standing with the rest of
the students screaming at the top of
their lungs. The players could barely
hear the referees whistle. The ten-
sion was overwhelming. I still didn’t
now what athletic apathy was but I
knew it wasn’t this. The game
went down to the last second without
a lull in the excitment, with W&L
barely losing a hard-fought battle. It
was the most exciting athletic event I
ever watched and judging by the ap-
plause of the crowd at the end of the
game, I think they agreed. Coach
Remillard and every player ap-
preciates this loyal support. Please
come out November 1 for a potential
rematch with Arkansas in the
Southern League Championships. It
will be the last home tournament of
the season and your ‘‘apathy”’ would
really help.

Robertson’s marriage raises

doubts about

MY VIEW
By George W. Gist

 

On October 1, 1987, Television
Evanglist Pat Robertson ('50) of-
ficially declared his candidacy for
the 1988 GOP presidential nomina-
tion.

Last Wednesday, a story appeared
in the Washington Post revealing
that Robertson was legally married
on August 27, 1954, contrary to infor-
mation he had published earlier.
Robertson’s official resume and
biography are misleading in that
they indicate that he and his wife
were married on March 22, 1954. The
issue here is not deception, but
rather, conception. Robertson’s first
son was born ten weeks after the cou-

leadership

ple was actually married.

In a speech Robertson gave upon
announcing his candidacy, he said,
“We must...bring back the old-
fashioned concept of moral restraint
and abstinence before marriage.”
When questioned about this passage,
the Post article reported, ‘‘He said he
feels strongly that young people
should not repeat his conduct.”

My question is this: if elected,
would Robertson lead the country on
the policy of ‘do as I say, not as I do?’
Leadership, in any capacity, is most
effective when the one in command
leads by example. Furthermore,
Robertson is advocating a double
standard by this statement.

The American public, it is said, is
looking for new leadership. If Pat
Robertson thinks that leadership
founded on these perverse principles
is the kind Americans are in pursuit
of, he might as well go stand in the
corner with Mr. Hart and Mr. Biden.

Correction

There was a printing error in last week’s ‘‘Hazing”’
editorial. The first paragraph should have read: ‘‘At a recent
Interfraternity Council meeting it was said that any house
found guilty of hazing would immediately be removed from
the Washington and Lee campus. However, that statement
was later qualified to include only acts of hazing that are
deemed serious. But what about acts of hazing that do not
result in severe physical injury? Are they any less a violation
of the law?”’

SAB posts $10,000 loss;
No beer was sold at event

 

By George Sparacio
Staff Reporter

 

Although advanced tickets sold out
for last Friday night’s Fixx concert,
the Student Activities Board of-
Washington and Lee University lost
close to $10,000 on the event, accor-
ding to SAB treasurer Chris Moore.

Moore said that in addition to the
500 advanced ticket sales, approx-
imately 400 tickets were sold at the
door, bringing the total sales to about
$7,200. Despite this, SAB president
Sean Coyle said, “The concert was
successful compared to last year’s
Homecoming concert. We sold two
times the amount of tickets.”’

The SAB paid about $17,500 for the
concert. They spent $11,500 for the
Fixx, $500 for Dreams So Real, the
opening band, $3,500 for the sound
and lights, $1,500 for promotion and
$500 for the contract rider and minor
construction needs, according to
Moore.

Moore said that the 1987-88 budget
of the SAB is $30,000. There are usual-
ly three or four concerts each year,
at Homecoming, Christmas, Fancy
Dress and in the spring. The SAB
plans on using $10,000 for each event.
However, this year they plan to cut
out the spring concert due to the
Mock Convention and the fact that
they lost about $7,000 on the
Guadalcanal Diary concert last spr-

ing.

No beer was sold at last weekend’s
concert, but non-alcoholic beverages
were available at no charge. When
asked whether the SAB lost money
which would have been made on beer
sales, Moore said, ‘In the past, beer
brought in only about $500.”’ Coyle
said, ‘I’m sure it kept some of the
people from coming, mostly
seniors.”

Coyle said the SAB hopes to have
beer at the Christmas concert, ‘‘but
first we have to go through the ABC
and then the administration.”’ He did
express however that the ABC would
make it difficult. He said, “I will
definitely try’”’ to be able to have beer
at the Christmas concert.

Career office sponsors new series

 

By Christie Champlin
Staff Reporter

 

The Career Development and
Placement Office, under the direc-
tion of Richard Heatley, has designed
a four part series to aid seniors in
preparing their resumes and learn-
ing interview skills.

The series, which includes two
training and two practical sessions in
each area, “‘proves to be a very
beneficial approach,” according to
Heatley. On Monday, seniors par-
ticipated in an_ interviewing
workshop and on Tuesday they at-
tended a resume training workshop.
These were followed by an all-day
resume training workshop. These
were followed by an all-day resume

Computers

The W&L microcomputer system
underwent a face lift over the sum-
mer.

Beginning in July, IBM’s latest
computer sytem, System Two, was
sent up throughout the university.
The new system, which was announc-
ed by IBM last April, involves a
switch from 5.25 inch disks to 3.5-inch
disks. According to Ruth Floyd,
Coordinator of Academic Computing
Applications, the change to small
disks on the microcomputers will
have many benefits.

“Three years from now it will be
the only type of microcomputer you
can get,”’ she said.

Floyd said the change to the small
disk was made primarily because of
its greater durability, and its ability
to store more intormation wan ine

skill when working with students in
an instructive way and, when need-
ed, in a corrective way,” said
Heatley of Henneman. The seniors
hear the ideals of a resume during
the workshop and usually have only a
“few miscellaneous little questions”’
during the critique sessions, said
Heatley.

Sometimes, said Heatley, the most
surprising fault with a resume is that
the student can not define his career
objective. This leads to career
counseling which consists of in-
vestigating the student’s major, see-
ing whether or not he enjoyed it,
determining the results of his career
testing, and discussing the possible
careers they can have as a gen-
eralist.

According to Heatley, there are on-
ly 20 major career areas; however,
there are 42,000 job titles.

If someone has less experience his
resume will be one page; however,
those with a greater amount of ex-
perience can expand the document to
two pages. Students can also have
more than one variation of a resume
to provide more definitions of the
career objective statement.

In the section describing work ex-
perience “if a student has two or
three types of work experience, sum-
mer or part-time, he should include
in careful, but reasonably full,
detail” his responsibilites using ac-
tion verbs, according to Heatley, ad-
ding that “‘if a student did not have

significant work experience the ac-
tivities section becomes more promi-
nent and may occur before work ex-
perience.”

The interests section ‘‘adds
humanity” to an interview because,
quite often, a recruiter will pull infor-
mation from the student’s interests,
said Heatley.

The office assists students in
“learning how to word’ their
statements. It is important not to
downplay activities and to learn
“sophisticated, professional’ ways
to state things, said Heatley. It is
necessary to find titles to respon-
sibilites and to use dynamic verbs to
describe these responsbilities to
“tactfully toot your own horn,” ac-
cording to Heatley.

The mock video sessions were
started last year by Schroer and con-
tinue this year through the CD&P Of-
fice and student recruiters. The first
fifteen minutes of each session is
devoted to filming the senior in an in-
terview situation with a recruiter and
the second fifteen minutes to a criti-
que of the tape.

Heatley believes that “‘it is very
important for students to catch the
series the office offers.’ There will
be another video session because of
the overflow of demand. The infor-
mation about it will be posted on the
bulletin board outside the CD&P of-
fice. There will also be another
resume workshop on December ist,
and a critique on December 3rd.

use new disks

“It is a much more durable
medium — the actual writing surface
of the disk is better protected,”’ she
said. “It’s also more dense. It stores
four times as much information.”

Floyd said the only difficulty that
arose from the modification was ar-
ranging for the information on 5.25-
inch disks to be stored on 3.5-inch
ones.

“We managed to provide some-
thing to bridge that gap,” she said,
although she added that equipment
available to make the micro-
computers compatible for 5.25-inch
disks and 3.5-inch disks was limited
due to a backorder.

In all, Floyd said 25 new microcom-
puters were installed over the sum-
mer, the majority of which went into
the Commerce school. Now that the
C-school has 29 microcomputers,
Floyd said classes held to teach
students, faculty and staff how to use

the computers have been expanded.

“With the C-school set up, this is
the first time we've been able to have
class of that size,’’ she said in
reference to the current computer
classes that have near full enroll-
ment.

Floyd said in the next year the
computer center would be attemp-
ting to implement what she referred
to as a Local Area Network in the
Commerce school.

The Local Area Network, which
currently exists in the Journalism
Department’s computer system,
allows students to submit files such
as papers and homework to pro-
fessors’ files through the computer
without having to turn in a print-out
of the paper. Floyd said this change
would greatly enhance the role of the
computers in the Commerce school.

The new 3.5-inch disks can be pur-
chased for $7 in the computer center.

and Lee and Rikkyo University officials.

W&L hosts domestic study...

By Laura Dodge
Staff Reporter

 

Four students from Japan are stu-
dying at W&L this year as part of the
East Asian Studies Program.

One of them comes from Rikkyo
University in Tokyo, and the other
three normally attend the Kansai
University of Foreign Studies in Kan-
sai Gaidai.

Another part of W&L’s broad East
Asian Studies Program involves an
exchange of two students with Chung
Chi College, the Chinese university of
Hong Kong.

W&L’s East Asian Exchange pro-
gram is an equal exchange for the
universities involved. Each students
pays tuition to their respective col-
leges for the year or semester, and
then just switches colleges. Air fare
is not included.

Each side must select a student
from a number of applications.
However, Professor Roger Jeans, a
member of the East Asian commit-
tee, thinks the foreign students from
Japan have more of a “fairly com-

petitive” application system since so
many want to study abroad.

Makiko Fuhui of Tokyo, nicknam-
ed Maki, chose W&L from a number
of U.S. colleges that offer exchange
programs with Japan. She said she
picked W&L because it “has a good
reputation” and she wanted to come
to the South for a ‘‘new experience.”

Having lived in Tokyo all her life,
then spending a month at the
American Language Program at Col-
umbia University, Fuhui said she
won’t miss the pollution or the traffic
of the cities, and she said she ‘‘loves
the countryside.”

In Tokyo Fuhui lives with her fami-
ly, which includes her parents, her
grandmother, a sister, and two cats
and a dog.

Her father, who has a librarian’s
degree from Louisiana State Univer-
sity, now works for an advertising
agency in Japan, dealing with many
Europeans and South East Asians.

Fuhui is also interested in
foreigners. She said, “‘If it’s possible
I'd like to work at a T.V. studio or a
travel agency.” Having already

received her qualification to teach
English, she is considering teaching
that or Japanese.

Fuhui said she already worked at a
T.V. studio in Japan. She finds that

.the students in Japan ‘‘work more on

their part-time jobs than school,” --
whereas in the U.S., students concen- *
trate more on academics. .

Fuhui thinks “people here work
much harder. It depends on the
students, but in general...”

Comparing Rikkyo to W&L, Fuhui
said they both deal primarily in
liberal arts. As far as her own
courses are concerned, she has a full
load,

“I find it difficult to take notes,
especially in American History. My
reading is so slow and the reading is
so much that it is very difficult.”

Fuhui likes W&L. ‘‘The people here
are so friendly. I think it’s a great
traditional custom to say ‘Hi’ when
you pass people in the street.”

As far as social life is concerned,
she seems to be doing well. During
this interview, she was asked for a
date to Homecoming.

...And also offers foriegn study

 

By Alice Harrell
Staff Reporter

 

For students of good academic
standing who long to experience the
lifestyle and educational oppor-
tunities of a different country, W&L
offers a variety of foreign study pro-
grams.

W&L offers both six-week Spring
Term and academic-year programs
for study abroad. Other options are
sponsored by the Seven College Ex-
change Program, including schools
such as Sweet Briar, Hollins, Hamp-
den-Sydney and VMI.

A student does not have to be tak-
ing a language to participate in
foreign exchange studies. The
Drama, Biology, Art, Religion and
English departments offer Spring
Term programs in London, the
Galapagos Islands, Athens, Japan,
and at Oxford University in England.

European language students can
study French in Paris, Spanish in
Madrid, and German in Bayreuth.
Each of these programs lasts six
weeks during Spring Term, East
Asian and Chinese and Japanese
studies are offered on a semester-

long or year-long basis in Taiwan,
Hong Kong, Hirakata City and
Tokyo.

‘As long as (the student is) going
to participate ina W&L program, you
have to be a good student in good
standing,” stated Dr. S.J. Williams,
who supervises study abroad in most
of the language departments.

He said that programs under the
other schools require a 2.5 GPA of
students that wanted to join.

Expense for going abroad must be
paid in addition to regular tuition;
financial aid, although somewhat
limited, is available to help cover the
costs. Students earn six credits
through the Spring Term programs.

Most programs require the student
to write a term paper or to do a pro-
ject of some kind as part of their
work done abroad.

Some programs involve a lot more,
however. Dr. Albert Gordon took
seven drama students abroad last
spring to study the acting techniques
and theatre practice of England. He
said that four times a week the
students ‘‘saw live plays...listened to
talks (given) by people in the
theatre, producers...then they wrote
papers about what they saw.”

 

The group spent four weeks in Lon-
don, then toured outside the city,
spending four or five daysin Paris. .

While these students enjoyed the
luxury of ‘‘bed-and-breakfast’’
hotels, those in other programs under
Spain and France stayed with
families in Paris and Madrid.

Senior Spanish student Ted Hart
talked about the differences in
lifestyle that he observed during his
eight-week stay in Spain (spending
two additional weeks traveling after
the original six-week term was over).

“Their whole outlook on life is com-
pletely different,” he commented.
“They're not as competitive with
other countries, not so pressured to
{out-] achieve other nations,
although they do compete among
themselves.”’

Sophomore Ashley Tredick added,
“It (study abroad) is a good program
if you want to learn the language and
experience the culture.”’ Tredick also
spent her Spring Term in Spain.

Students who would like more in-
formation on foreign study should at-
tend the information session spon-
sored by the foreign study committee
on Tuesday, Oct. 20 at 7:00 p.m. in the
Student Center, Room 114.

Crew club experiences revival |

 

By Fran Coryell
Staff Reporter

 

The W&L crew club is making a
comeback.

The club ended in the 1970's. Last
year Tim Vesper, who is now in law
school in Tennessee, restarted the
club by purchasing an ergometer (a
rowing machine) with money given
tohim by the E.C.

This year Brandon Canaday, Debi
Hurtt, Mare Mulligan and Steve
Muller are trying to continue the
development of the club.

Members of the crew club are still
working out on the ergometer, which
is located behind the Lee House. The
club has eight oars on order and has a
good lead on two four-man shells.

This is a good start for such a
young club since the boats are expen-
sive and hard to find.

The earliest the club could get the
boats would be in the late Fall. The
club could get on-water experience at
the national boy scout camp near
Goshen. The earliest competition
could come in the Spring against

Superdance ’88 kicks off with FD raffle

 

By Brook Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

Planning for the 10th Annual
Superdance has already kicked into
action.

Raffle tickets to win a Fancy Dress
Dream Weekend were sold at the
Fixx concert homecoming weekend,
and on Tuesday, October 13, commit-
tee members stormed Sweetbriar to
conduct informative hall meetings.

The Fancy Dress raffle is a fun-
draiser that offers two nights at the
Lexington Holiday Inn, dinner for
two at Maple Hall, Fancy Dress
tickets, T-shirts, cups and posters
compliments of the SAB, brunch at
the Palms on Sunday, March 6, anda

$15 gift certificate for lunch at
Willson-Walker as its prizes.

One ticket costs $2 and five cost $3.
Sales of the tickets ‘‘are going as well
as can be expected,” according to
Superdance co-chair Greg Knapp.

“The problem right now is that not
too many people are thinking of Fan-
cy Dress right now. It’s a good deal
with over $270 worth in prizes,’’ he
said.

The drawing will be held February
6.

More hall meetings are planned at
the Virginia Military Institute, the
other women’s colleges, and on the
W&L campus. Superdance commit-
tee members will provide pamphlets
about the 15 hour dance marathon as
well as encourage people to par-
ticipate.

Part of what the members will be
explaining are the new pledge rules
this year. Knapp explained that ‘“‘last
year we lost money when we billed
people. They’d look at a bill for only a
dollar and say, ‘it’s just a dollar.’”’

Because of the large failure to pay
small sum pledge bills, only about
$8,000 was actually collected out of
$12,000 pledged. In order to avoid this
money loss, the committee is requir-
ing that all pledges under $5 be paid
by cash or check.

Also, the $100 initial fee per dancer
must be paid in cash.

Each dancer is asked to collect at
least $100 either through a flat fee or
a certain amount per hour ‘‘with the
stipulation,’’ Knapp stressed, ‘‘that
each person should be dancing the
whole 15 hours.”’

He said “‘last year we had a lot of
people just lounging around. I think
it’s because alot of [fraternity]
pledges didn’t want to dance but
were required to dance. This year
rather than have 15 pledges stand
around... we’re asking the frats for
their support.”

Instead of requiring the frats to
make their pledges dance, the com-
mittee wants the fraternities to get
each of their pledges to raise 100
dollars and then sponsor a couple.

Since this is the 10th Annual Super-
dance, the co-chairmen Mike Herrin,
Chuck Husting, and Knapp, along
with their 10 year faculty advisor
Fontaine Bostic, are hoping for a big
success.

Their monetary goal is $30,000, the

same as last year. Although last
year’s pledges, at $33,000, exceeded
that goal, the actual amount col-
lected was $29,000. After expenses
are deducted, all of the money will go
directly to the Muscular Distrophy
Association office in Roanoke.

Last year’s Superdance band was
the White Animals. “This year,”
Knapp said, We're looking for
another medium-sized band, which
will hopefully be better than what
you see in the Pit.’’ Also, they plan to
have a smaller student band enter-
tain the dancers in the afternoon.

Some of the reasons students join-
ed the Superdance committee are:

Carol Howson — ‘I competed in an
event like this back home for Special
Olympics. It was a gymnastics-a-
thon.”’

Ted Schieke — “‘I am trying to get
involved in more school activities,
and the last 2 years have been alot of
fun.”

Brad Slappey — ‘‘“My mom would
be proud of me if she knew.”

duPont displays watercolor collection

 

By George G. Sparacio
Staff Reporter

 

A collection of watercolor pain-
tings by Basil E. Martin is on display
this month in the duPont Gallery of
Washington and Lee University.

Martin, born in Chelsford, England
in 1903, studied at the Chelsea In-
stitute and the Central Art Institute
in London before moving to the
United States in 1924.

The artist’s paintings have been
exhibited with the American Water-
color Society, the American Federa-
tion of Arts, the Golden Gate Exposi-
tion in San Francisco, the British
Empire Exposition at Wembley,
England, and the High Museum in
Atlanta.

He also had an number of one-man
shows in the U.S. His most successful
was back in 1948 at the Van Diemen
Galleries in New York City.

Most of Martin’s works are land-
scapes from Pennsylvania and
Maine. They include close-ups of
autumn foliage, colorfully shaded
snow scenes and numerous varia-
tions of the forests and woodlands
surrounding him.

The November 1948 issue of ‘‘Art
News’’ said about his Van Diemen
exhibit, ‘Martin uses watercolor
without tricks or ostentation, but
with a brilliance and clarity that
belongs to very few members of the
American Watercolor Society.”’

The Nov. 12, 1948 issue of the ‘‘New
York Sun’”’ said, ‘Martin is a realist
but one who does not hesitate to take
a few liberties with subject for ex-
igencies of compositional unity.”’

The watercolors are on loan to the
duPont Gallery from the collection of
Mr. Shelley Krasnow of Manassas,

tin, spoke at the opening of the show

day Fraternity House Corporation
Conference held last weekend.

During the Saturday session,
Oakland spoke on the ‘‘Methodology
of Renovation Planning”’ and pointed
out some of the facts unique to
Washington and Lee’s fraternity
system.

“There are three different types of
buildings being used as fraternity
houses at Washington and Lee,”
Oakland said.

“Old fraternity houses, relatively
new fraternity houses, and buildings
such as mansions and schoolhouses
which have been converted into
fraternity houses will all present dif-
ferent challenges.”

“After VMDP Architects, Inc. has
done the cost estimating,” said Lewis
G. John, Dean of Students, ‘“‘those
figures will be submitted to a financ-
ing committee to determine the most
suitable method of funding the reno-
vations.

“Our aim is to have the estimates
available for discussion by the May
Board of Trustees meeting.”

Both “favorable interest loans’’
and fund raising drives were men-
tioned in the conference as possible
financing plans.

The Fraternity House Corporation
Conference also reviews the new
guidelines and responsibilities of the
fraternities stated in a six part hand-
out, ‘“‘Standards for Fraternities.”

“All of the responsibilities and re-
quirements are to be meet by the fall
of 1988, said Leroy C. “Buddy”’
Atkins, associated dean of Students.

Dean John said, “The student
awareness and active participation
in the program will definitely have a
positive influence in its success.”’

Trident elects freshmen representatives

“There is a lot more to co-
education than the classroom,”’ said
Cary Baber, newly elected freshman
-epresentative to Trident.

Tuesday night, Trident held elec-
ions for two positions open to
reshman women. Five women ran
or the positions.

Laura Dodge joins Baber as a

“Trident is a place women are
automatically involved and a voice is

women without being a hindrance to
any other male activity,’’ said Baber.

Both women feel that through Tri-
dent activities, the group will be
more visible and will unite the
women at Washington and Lee.

‘Being a woman at this school is a
big challenge,”’ said Dodge. She said
the male students have the frater-
nities for an outlet, but it is much
tougher on the women.

Harriers sneak
past Catholic U.

The Ring-tum Phi, October 15, 1987

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

It was close. Maybe too close for
comfort, but the Washington and Lee
men’s cross country team edged out
a 27-28 win over Catholic University
last Saturday on the General’s home
course.

Leading the way for W&L was
senior co-captain Scott Rippeon, who
finished second overall with a time of
28:12 over the eight-kilometer
course. The individual race for first
was also close as Rippeon lost by only
two records to Catholic’s Tom Caf-
frey. Following close behind for the
Generals (3-2) was senior Bill Clark
(3rd, 28:20). Freshman Larry Pilkey
(5th, 29:07), senior co-captain Rick
Norris (8th, 30:36) and freshman
Kennon Walthal (9th, 31:52) were the
other scorers for W&L.

‘We ran quite well as a team,”
said head coach Dick Miller. ‘‘We’re
spread out a long ways this year.
We're not very close together as you
can see by our times.’

The Generals competed without
the services of senior Richard Moore,
who missed the meet because of
medical school exams. Miller,
however, said this was not the reason
for the distance between the No. 1
and No. 5 runners.

‘*We’ve lost two men from last year
who we really haven’t replaced,”’ he
said. ‘‘We just haven't got that quali-

Junior Keith Boyd makes an apparent touchdown catch in the
endzone against Maryville. Boyd was ruled out of bounds on the

play.

ty of runner right now who can run
that close together.’’

What the Generals haven’t had
recently is pleasant weather in which
to race. This was not the case last
Saturday as sunny skies and warm
temperatures were the rule, not the
exception.

‘Tt was a beautiful day,’’ said
Miller. ‘‘You couldn’t ask for
anything better.’

Miller also commented on the pro-
gress of the Generals’ workouts and
training methods. W&L has been
tapering for its meets by having a
light practice on one day of the week.

“I feel, that during the week, we
need at least one rest day,’ said
Miller. ‘‘We’ve never done much the
day before a meet. It’s just a fun day;
a loosening up day.”’

On Saturday, the Generals travel
to Eastern Mennonite to run against
Goshen College, Bridgewater and E-
M in a quadrangular meet.
Bridgewater and E-M are two
schools that are members of the Old
dominion Athletic Conference.

“There will be a number of teams
there which will give us more of a
challenge than just a dual meet,”
said Miller. “I don’t look at our
regular season matches as far as an
indication of what can happen, say,
at the ODAC [championships]. This
is one Saturday; that’s another
Saturday, and once in a while so-
meone has a bad day.”

Women runners

take fifth

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Cross country invitational meets
are a lot of fun. You get anywhere
from 50 to 100 runners in the field
and, when the gun sounds, it’s every
person for himself. It seems like you
are always passing people or getting
passed yourself, so the competition is
fierce.

That sense of competition is what
the Washington and Lee women’s
cross country team was looking for
when it competed in the Division II
and III State Meet in Newport News,
Va. last Saturday.

‘‘We thought it was a good meet for
us,”’ said head coach Jim Phemister.
“It accomplished what we wanted to,
which was to get everybody out there
running faster than they had before.”’

“In a developing program, [an in-
vitational] is sometimes the only
chance you get to run against other
people.”

The Generals were without their
No. lL runner, freshman Paige Cason,
who was out with a foot injury, but
the team got some fine performances
from some of the younger members
of the squad. Junior Anne Geary was
W&L’s first finisher with a time of
22:11 for the five-kilometer course.
Freshmen Heather Jenkins and Pat
Lopez, with times of 22:42 and 23:45
respectively, were the No. 2 and No. 3
scorers for the Generals. Phemister

Football blows lead to Maryville in

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

The Maryville Scots scored 21
points in the fourth quarter Saturday
to overcome a 17-3 deficit and spoil
Washington and Lee’s Homecoming
game, 24-19.

“In the first half, we were sort of
stumbling around in our own tracks
offensively,’ said head coach Gary
Fallon. “And, in the second half,
things just didn’t fall our way.

The Scots received the kickoff to
open the game, but the W&L defense
forced a Maryville punt after just
three plays. The Generals turned the
ball over less than two minutes-ater,
and the Scots drove to the W&L 30,
where a 47-yard field goal attempt by
Maryville kicker Henry Marambio
sailed just wide. .

After a W&L punt and a Maryville
fumble, the Generals drove 54 yards
to the Scot 15, where freshman
Carter Quayle split the uprights to
put W&L on the scoreboard, 3-0, with
4:43 left in the first quarter.

The two teams exchanged punts for
the rest of the first period and most of
the second. But W&L closed out the
first half with a 70-yard drive, capped
by a one-yard scoring pass to senior
tailback Chris Coffland from
sophomore quarterback Phil Samp-
son.

The Generals received the kickoff
to open the second half, hoping to ex-
tend their ten-point lead, but were

forced to punt three plays later. The
Scots took possession at their own 44
and drove to the W&L 10, where
Marambio nailed a 25-yard field goal
to cut the lead to seven with 9:17 re-
maining in the period.

Nine minutes later, W&L’s Samp-
son hit senior tight end Gar Prebor
over the middle from three yards out.
Quayle’s extra point gave the
Generals a 14-point lead with three
seconds gone in the fourth quarter.

The Scots suddenly decided they
would not accept their fourth loss in
as many games and put together a 73-
yard drive, ending on a 35-yard scor-
ing pass from senior quarterback
Mike Human to senior split end Bill
Delaney. Marambio’s kick with2:31
left in the game pulled the Scots
within seven.

After a W&L punt, the Scots put on
another excellent drive, capped by a
nine-yard carry by sophomore Mike
Randow with 6:25 left. Marambio’s
extra point attempt was good, and
the score was tied for the first time
since the game began.

W&L freshman Car! Gilbert fielded
the kickoff but turned the ball over on
his fourth fumble of the day, and
Maryville senior Jason Harbinson
recovered. The Scots quickly took ad-
vantage of the turnover, scoring in
only five plays on a two-yard run by
freshman Scott Roberts. Marambio’s
kick gave the Scots the lead, 24-17,
with 3:54 remaining, a lead they
would never relinquish.

The Generals drove to their own 47,

but the drive ended when W&L failed
to convert on fourth down. But a
Maryville fumble two plays later
gave the Generals a second chance
with 1:58 remaining.

Imitating his performance against
Randolph-Macon, Sampson put to-
gether a 55-yard drive in five plays
and 42 seconds, inluding a near TD
pass to junior split end Keith Boyd
that the officials ruled incomplete.

W&L’s hopes for a miracle ap-
parently came to an end when a
Sampson pass was intercepted in the
end zone by sophomore Randy
Turner. The Scots needed to run off
1:16 to lock up their first win of the
season.

The Scots fell on the ball on the first
three downs, but the Generals were
able to use their last timeout to bring
up fourth down with 28 seconds left.
Human gave up a safety by running
out the back of the end zone, cutting
the Maryville lead to five, and the
Generals got another chance when
the Scots kicked off with 22 seconds
left.

W&L fielded the kick with a fair
catch, giving Sampson and Co. yet
another opportunity to pull off the
win. The Generals drove 33 yards in
five plays, including a pass from
Sampson to senior All-America
tackle John Packett.

“T just reached out and caught it,”’
said Packett. ‘‘I could smell the goal
line, but I knew the officials wouldn’t
let me get away with it.”

The pass was indeed called back,

place

noted Lopez and freshman Margaret
Boyd (5th for W&L) as having par-
ticulary good days.

“We had two first-years who
scored for the first time,’”’ he said.
“We are real happy to see that
development out of them.”’

Out of seven teams, the Generals
finished fifth overall in the team
results but the two schools W&L
defeated were not able to field full
teams.

At this point in the season,
Phemister is pleased with the team’s
progress. Workouts are becoming
more familiar and routine and the
Generals have increased the distance
in their weekly mileage.

“‘We’ve built their overall mileage
up to 35 miles per week,’ said
Phemister. ‘Their longest run is a
ten-mile run and we have a mix of
speed and hill workouts as well.’’

According to Phemister, Cason
should be back within a week. Cason
is having problems with her feet and
her shoes. Phemister said it is not a
muscle strain but just a swelling that
is keeping Cason sidelined.

On Saturday, the Generals will
finally get an opportunity to run on
their home course as they play host
to a meet that will include runners
from all the other Old Dominion
Athletic Conference schools.

4th quarter

and the clock ran out on the next
play, giving the Scots a 24-19 victory
in their second Old Dominion Athletic
Conference game of the season. The
Generals are now 1-2 in the ODAC.

W&L will travel to Hampden-
Sydney Saturday to take on one of
their toughest opponents of the
season.

The Tigers, picked to win the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference in pre-
season rankings, own a 3-2 record,
but are undefeated in their two con-
ference contests. H-S beat Bridge-
water easily, 35-18, and edged Emory
and Henry last weekend, 14-13.

“When they faced Emory and
Henry,” said Fallon, ‘‘we knew it
was going to be a real dog fight.’’ The
Tigers pulled out the win when Jim-
my Hondroulis kicked his 49th-
consecutive conversion attempt with
3:07 left in the game. H-S’s defense
held Wasp quarterback Gary Collier
to nine of 18 passing for only 74 yards
and pulled down an interception at
the H-S one-yard line.

The Tigers were led by senior
fullback David Kelly (5-10, 185), who
carried 25 times for 139 yards and one
touchdown. ‘‘One of the finest run-
ning backs in the league,” said
Fallon.

Defensively, Fallon said the Tigers
aren’t very large, but they are very
balanced, quick and aggressive.
‘We're going to have our hands fill-
ed, there’s no question about it.””

Earlier loss avenged, but H,O polo fades in SE Varsity Invitational

By Hunter Catlett
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee water
polo team is not sure how it should
feel after avenging an early season
loss only to lose the final two games
of the weekend.

The 20th-ranked Generals (16-4)
started the weekend off on a good
note by beating the 16th-ranked
Bucknell Bisons 12-11 in double over-
time. The win evened the season
series between the two teams--
Bucknell won 12-10 in Providence,
R.I., way back on September 20.

Against the Bisons, the Generals

jumped to a 1-0 lead on a goal by
junior co-captain David Reavy.
Bucknell’s Robert Dickens struck
back with two goals near the end of
the first period to give the Bisons a
2-1 lead.

Junior Andrew Morgan of W&L
tied the score at 2-2 nearly two
minutes into the period. Bucknell ex-
ploded back with four goals, two by
Dickens, to take a 6-2 lead. Junior co-
captain David Dietz scored with 46
seconds left in the period, and W&L
trailed 6-3 at the half.

Defense controlled the beginning of
the third period, as neither team was
able to score until junior Moose Herr-

It was an unfortunate coincidence

* that the last two opponents of the
« Washington and Lee women’s soccer

team were scheduled close together.

* Saturday’s game against Randolph-
_ Macon/Ashland resulted in a 5-0 loss,

and the score was 7-1 against

day. Surprisingly, it is the R-M
match that disappointed the players

week, so the General’s conference
record now stands at 3-1.

W&L had a disappointing Home-
coming on Smith Field last Saturday
as the team team was shut out 3-0 by
Messiah. Things just didn’t get roll-
ing early enough and, as a result, the
team moral dropped off enabling the
opponent to sneak off with the win.

Yesterday, W&L took a road trip to
Lynchburg only t return with another
mark to place in the loss col-
umn. Once again, the team got down
early and was unable to make the big
comeback. The Generals were at a
2-0 deficit when senior Chuck Lyle

the most, and the loss to Roanoke
would have probably been taken
more in stride if it weren’t for the
somewhat disheartening  oc-
currences of two straight negative
outcomes for W&L.

The Homecoming atmosphere on
Saturday was expected to tilt
chances of victory in the Generals’
favor. However, the players —. in-
cluding the captains — and head
coach Janine Hathorn reiterated the
fact that the activities on the side-
lines were serious distractions. W&L

ing’s shot found the goal with 2:05
gone, pulling the Generals to within
two. The Bisons quickly scored to
take a 7-4 lead with over four minutes
to play in the period. Junior Martin
Burlingame and Morgan then scored
consecutive goals for the Generals to
make it 7-6. The Generals kept the
clamps on Dickens and the rest of the
Bisons until Bucknell scored with 13
seconds left to make it 8-6 after three
periods of play.

The fourth period started slowly
and ended with a flurry. Dietz scored
a goal with 5:40 remaining to make it
8-7. There was a lull in the scoring un-
til, with 2:21 left in the game, senior

Simon Perez struck paydirt to tie the
score at eight. Twenty-one seconds
later, Bucknell’s Dickens broke free
for his final of a game high five goals,
and the Bisons led 9-8 with two
minutes to play.

With thirty seconds left in the
game, Reavy scored to tie the score
at 9 and send the contest into over-
time.

WA&L drew first blood in overtime,
as Dietz scored just nine seconds into
the period, giving the Generals a 10-9
lead. Bucknell again came back,
scoring two goals in 45 seconds to
take an 11-10 lead.

Once again Reavy

saved the

a row; end win streak at 3

found the back of the net and placed
W&L on the board. It was, unfor-
tunately, the General’s only direct hit
of the game.

Junior co-captain Johnny Sarber
commented on the team’s inability to
get on top of things early. ‘“‘We got
down 2-0 really early, as usual,”’ he
said, ‘‘but we showed a lot of com-
posure and came back and scored a
goal.”’

With the exception of an early lack
of intensity, W&L did play a solid
game.

“We played well in the second half
of the game,” said Sarber. ‘‘Their

had already lost to R-M and were ex-
pecting another challenge, yet the
General’s were optimistic about
avenging the previous defeat. Ob-
viously, concentration is a key ele-
ment in any competition, and W&L
needs that edge against a formidable
opponent such as R-M.

“We all thought we could have
done better,’’ said Mattson.
“Although we knew the team, we
played worse in this second game.

The Roanoke game on Tuesday

last two goals were made at the very
end of the game, and so the score
(5-1) was really no indication of the
game.”

The Generals still remain on top of
things in the ODAC, but they will face
a very tough squad in Gettysburg
College this Saturday at Gettysburg.
With six games left on the schedule,
W&L has plenty of time to get back to
the 500 mark. The General’s next
home game will be on Tuesday
against the Keydets of Virginia
Military Institute. W&L’s goal in this
game is to send the Keydets away on
“the walk of shame.”’

‘Women are still searching for first victory of Season

caused mixed reactions. Of course,
the final score was not wholly en-
couraging, but the team was satisfied
with its performance.

Sophomore Sarah Allen, from her
position as stopper which is not near
the front line — drove the ball in.

The Generals are

turning their attention towards
Thursday's home match with rival
Hollins, which looks promising, and
could help negate some disappoint
ment concerning the last two games

Generals, scoring with 57 seconds left
to tie it at 11 after the first three-
minute session.

During the second overtime,
neither of the exhausted teams could
crack the others defense until
Reavy—there’s that name again—
scored with 12 seconds remaining to
give W&L a hard-fought 12-11 vic-
tory.

The Bucknell game might well
have been a costly victory for W&L
however, as the Generals faded bad-
ly in the second half in their losses to
both Iona and Navy.

Against 17th-ranked Iona, the
Generals trailed by two at halftime,

only to end up losing 11-5.

W&L also trailed 13th-ranked Navy
by two at the half, 7-5, before fading
en route toa 15-5 setback.

“We were up for the Bucknell
game, but physically tired for the
other two games,” said head coach
Page Remillard.

This weekend the water polo team
will travel to Richmond to play in the
second round of the Southern League
Championships. Two weeks ago, in
Lexington, W&L finished second to
the University of Arkansas-Little
Rock in the first round of the tourna-
ment.

Words in Edgewise

THE Boss has mid-life crisis

By Marshall Boswell
Staff Reporter

 

My goodness, what has happened
to poor Bruce Springsteen?

It’s not just that his new record is
unspeakably awful (which it is).
Plenty of important pop artists have
hatched raw eggs at the height of
their careers (anybody remember
Prince’s Around the World in a Day?
Thought not). Springsteen is a
special case — a man with all the
talent and integrity anybody could
ask for, coupled with an adoring au-
dience, glowing press, and the
easiest act to maintain in popular
music. I mean, the man made an
outrageous fortune being a good guy.
So where did it all go so terribly
wrong?

Before The River — his double
album epic that signalled the beginn-
ing of the end — Bruce Springsteen
made four records worth of some of
the most emotionally powerful
popular music committed to vinyl.
He started off as a prodiguously
talented heir to the throne of Bob
Dylan and Van Morrison, penning in-
tricate soul-and folk-influenced songs
that surged with startling lyrical
detail and clever wordplay. Then, in
no time, he channeled all of this
talent into a singular imaginative
worldview that used as its poignant
metaphores, the amusement parks
and boardwalks of the New Jersey
coast. And the music! Epic and an-
thematic were the only words to
describe it: the rolling piano work,

Pianist Rop

By George Sparacio
Staff Reporter

 

English pianist Sophie Roper-
Curzon performed for a large crowd
in Lee Chapel on Tuesday night play-
ing a variety of pieces from several
different eras.

Roper-Curzon, 19, began her pro-
gram with an Italian Concerto by
Bach. She played each of the three
movements gracefully and for the
most part accurately. She continued
with Schubert’s Impromptu in G flat
major which she played with intense
feeling. George Ray, an English pro-
fessor at Washington and Lee, said
that she seemed the most at home
with this piece. She concluded the

the doo-wop saxophones, tine tirst in
the air slogans of youthful idealism.

Sprinsteen’s following was so mili-
tant that to say anything derogatory
about the man in New Jersey was
certain to result in a severed head or,
at the very least, a broken wind-
shield. But all the hoopla, for once,
was almost warranted. The man was
a true hero: he spoke to these people
with such accuracy, such conviction,
that it was never a question of his
selling out. Oh no, he was born to run.
He was pulling outta here to win.

Then something strange happened.
The media, smelling a happening in
the works, caught on. And they told
everyone that he was the real thing,
that he meant every word, that he’d
never let you down. Finally a rock
star you could believe in. The man
woke up one day and found that he
was the Boss — an embarrasingly
wealthy one, at that. He was, in the
end, just a pop star — a commodity
for the record company to market,
the sales pitch being, “‘He’s a true
rock and roller who is really one of
us.’’ And somewhere, in order to
maintain his “‘integrity’’ (the way
Motley Crue maintains its
“rebelliousness’’ or Madonna main-
tains her “‘slutishness’’), Springsteen
altered his act: He became the voice
of the working class.

How ironic. As soon as the man
becomes an Industry, he all at once
begins articulating the desires of its
employees.

But some of us weren’t fooled. For
one thing, his music deteriorated
drastically. It was all three chord
“rock and roll,” designed to appeal
to his new mass audience. And the

er-Curzon

first half of her program with
Beethoven’s Sonata in C major, Opus
2 No. 3. She attacked the piece. It
seemed as though her hands were
made for the piano.

She started the second half of her
program with Bartok’s Six dances in
Bulgarian Rhythm. Professor
Timothy Gaylard of the Washington
and Lee music department said that
she showed ‘‘a definitude for the
music.’’ She continued with
Rachmaninoff’s Prelude in B minor,
Opus 32 No. 10. The program conclud-
ed with Chopin’s Andante Spianato
and Grande Polonaise Brillante,
Opus 22. Gaylard said that this piece
was ‘“‘most pianistically difficult.”
He continued by saying, ‘‘For some-

lyrical detail that made him so
special gave way to inarticulate
platitudes, lifted not from the mouths
of the people toward whom the songs
were directed, but rather second-
hand from ‘‘authentic’’ artists like
Flannery O’Connor, Woody Gutherie,
and Raymond Carver. He set out to
become an icon, but he’s inadvertent-
ly become a pathetic joke.

First came The River, a two record
set that Rolling Stone hailed as Bruce
Springsteen’s Grapes of Wrath. One
song, “Drive All Night,’’ was eight
minutes long, consisted of three
chords, and offered this as sign of the
narrator’s conviction: ‘Baby, I'd
drive all night/Just to buy you some
shoes.” The line ‘‘darkness on the
edge of town’’ appeared three times
on the record and was, not in-
significantly, the title of his previous
record. At least half the songs were
about cars, two had the word ‘‘heart”’
in their title, and nearly every one of
them was, in one way or another, sex-
ist.

Nebraska, a solo record where
Bruce made his Folk Statement,
followed, with the Boss singing
sparse acoustic tales of unemploy-
ment and unfulfilled dreams. The
record went platinum. And _ then
there was Born in the U.S.A., featur-
ing the new muscle-bound Bruce
displaying his backside on the album
cover, along with an American flag
— all just in time for the 1984 elec-
tions. Sure, the title track was really
about angry Vietnam Vets (a subject
Bruce should know all about: he lied
on his medical record in order to
avoid the 60’s draft). Was it his fault
if everybody took it as a patriotic an-

returns to

one her age, she did remarkably
well.”

Roper-Curzon made her debut in
the United States in the fall of 1985 at
Washington and Lee. Chris Deighan,
a 1987 graduate of Washington and
Lee said, ‘I saw her two years ago
when she was here, and her style has
really matured.”’

Junior music major Kevin
Struthers said, “I was awe-struck.
She’s just incredible. The scary part
is, what will she be like in five or ten
years.”

Freshman John McManus said,
“Asan art and rock fan, I even en-
joyedit.”

In 1985, Roper-Curzon was the win-
ner of the British Piano Maker’s

them? He’s just a rock star.

And finally, there was Bruce Spr-
ingsteen and the E Street Band Live, a
five-record in concert albatross that
is currently collecting dust in record
stores all over the world. Wait
another couple of months and you
might be able to buy it for about ten
bucks.

Now we arrive at Bruce Springs-
teen, the 1987 model. On the cover of
his new album, Tunnel Of Love, he
looks like a matinee idol (although
there is still an attempt at ‘‘authen-
ticity’ by having him pose in overalls
on the lyric sheet). The subject of the
new album is love — he is an adoring
husband now — and the approach is
Sensitive, Singer-Songwriter of the
Proletariat. But his vocabulary has
dwindled to about fifty words. Here is
a typical line from the record: ‘‘Get
it straight mister/Hey buddy that
ain’t me.”’ His new slogans have all
the depth of a Hallmark card: ‘‘When
you’re alone you ain't nothing but
alone.”’ And the music is so tepid that
it threatens to sour right there on the
turntable. If Brian Eno had made
this record, he might have called it
Music for Dentist Offices. Bruce plays
everything on the disc but percus-
sion, so most of the arrangements
consist of either a solo acoustic
guitar or a preprogrammed syn-
thesizer track. The E Street Band, I
suppose, was too busy dealing with
the stock holders. And there on the
liner notes is this telling dedication:
“Thanks to... everyone at Columbia
Records and CBS Records Interna-
tional for their freindship and com-
mitment over the years.”

I guess he really is the Boss.

Well, let me start with a few com-
ments about this article. Firstly, I
hope this will be the first in a series of
articles that will aid you, the con-
sumer, in searching for what might
be your favorite restaurant in Lex-
ington and vicinity. Secondly, this
column, and all others like it, will not
always be right simply because all
tastes differ, and that like test driv-
ing a car other than one made in Ger-
many, the critic may taste a
“‘lemon.”’

This morning I ventured to the Old
Main Street Sandwich Shoppe for
what I hoped to be a great lunch. I
had heard many good things from
various people and maybe, no, pro-
bably expected a little to much. But
with this in mind, and some reflec-
tion I offer you this critique.

I started this morning’s meal with
one of my all-time favorites: the
chicken salad sandwich on rye with
lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise.

Now, several of you may be saying to

, yourselves ‘‘How can chicken salad
be exciting.’’ And to be honest, now,
so am I. I think my mother, who
doesn’t cook (she uses one of those
things we have come accustomed to
in Stop-In on Wednesday night),
could possibly produce something a
little more exciting. But one should
remember that chicken salad is
chicken salad-it is basic, and this
sandwich shop certainly has wide-
range basics including vegetarian
concoctions.

What was exciting was one of the
Old Main Sandwich Shoppe’s special-
ty subs, the Polish Ham Sub: Ham
piled on a sub roll with imported
Polish Tilsit Cheese, lettuce, tomato,
onions, and a super delectable mild
horseradish sauce. What a change
from Humdrum ham 'n cheese.
There are others including an in-
teresting Taco Sub and the Grand
Marnier. If the quality and
deliciousness of the Polish Ham Sub
carries over to the others, they can
only be YUM!!

Britain’s Smiths say
their final goodbye

 

By Greg Ossi
Music Critic

 

With the breakup of The Smiths
last month, their latest effort,
“Strangeways, Here We Come’’ will
probably be their last as a complete
group. If you haven’t heard, guitarist
Johnny Marr called it quits and Mor-
rissey went on to his solo projects,
leaving the Smiths without their an-
choring members.

The album suffers no let down
because of this. It is well mixed and

diversified. When compared to their
past productions this album com-
pares favorably or better. Morrissey
is still telling morbid and depressing
stories and the melodies are still
ringing in your head long after you
have listened to them.

Strangeways begins on an upbeat
note with the song “A Rush and A
Push And The Land Is Ours.”’ The
song itself starts out with Morrissey
playing a catchy rhythm on the
piano. They reiterate their favorite
theme in ‘‘Death Of a Disco Dancer.”
“Girlfriend In a Coma’’ the first
single released earlier this summer
is another catchy tune with an in-

credibly morbid tale.
On the B-side Morrissey tackles his

self-proclaimed celibacy in ‘Last
Night I Dreamt That Somebody Lov-
ed Me.’ Beginning the song
with an eerie piano solo mixed with
the noise of a screaming crowd in the
background. Following is one of the
most unusual birthday songs ever
recorded, entitled “Unhappy Birth-
day.”’

In “Paint A Vulgar Picture,”’ one
of the album’s strongest tracks is a
sarcastic ode to the exploitation of
dead stars by money-grubbing
record companies. The record ends
with the mellow ‘‘I Won't Share You”
another Smiths tune backed by
Marr’s acoustic guitar playing and
Morrissey’s melodic sing-song voice.

The album is the tightest ever
released by the Smiths. It is definite-
ly their smoothest recording job.
Some will cry that they have sold out
by adding the various strings to some
of the tracks making them almost
Beatleseque. I argue that this is not
the case, the strings only added to
the strength of the album which is
made up of meaningful lyrics and
driving yet harmonious tunes.

If you like the Smiths you will love
the album.
