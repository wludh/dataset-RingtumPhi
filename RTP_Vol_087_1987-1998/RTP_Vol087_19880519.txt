Tennis nets W&L’s first national title

 

By Stuart Sheldon
Staff Reporter

 

After finishing second for two years
in a row, the Washington and Lee
men’s tennis team won this year’s
Division II] national championship,
becoming the first W&L team to ever
win a national title. The General's in-
credible come-from-behind win put
the cap on the first half of an interest-
ing week of tennis.

W&L won the title yesterday with a
5-4 victory over the University of Ca-
lifornia-Santa Cruz Banana Slugs.
UCSC was the No. | seed at the tour-
nament and had a regular season re-
cord of 21-1, without a single D-II
loss.

Yesterday's and Tuesday’s rain for-
ced play to be moved to the indoor fa-
cilities in Staunton and Lynchburg.
The shift of venue took away some of
the General’s homecourt advantage,
but support was definitely present dur-
ing the match.

The two teams faced off yesterday
afternoon and evening at the Staunton
Racquet Club. With only three courts
and room for only several dozen fans,
the Club has seen heavy use during the
tournament.

Supported by as many W&L stu-
dents that could squeeze in the gallery,

the Generals rallied from a 4-2 deficit,
sweeping the three doubles matches to
edge the Slugs 5-4.

W&L was led by its cagey veterans,
senior co-captains Chris Wiman and
David McLeod, throughout the long
match. Play began at 1:30 in the after
noon, and, with a two-hour break be-
tween singles and doubles, didn’t end
until 11:20 last night.

Junior Bobby Matthews, W&L’s
No. | man, lost quickly in straight sets
to UCSC’s Ron Ward 6-2, 6-3. Matt-
hews will continue action in the sec-
ond half of this tournament week,
competing in both singles and doubles
action. Matthews is seeded sixth in the
singles competition.

Junior Robert Haley, at No. 2 for
the Generals, battled back brilliantly
against Chad Andrews, but faltered
late in the third set. Andrews was pin-
ned to the baseline in the first set, los-
ing to Haley 6-2. Andrews rallied,
however, sending the match into over-
time with a 6-3 win in the second set.
Haley made a run at Andrews, tying
the third set at 4-4 games, but slipped,
losing 6-4.

Haley will also compete this week
in singles action.

McLeod had early difficulty against

UCSC’s No. 3 man, Mark Roberts

Elliott Abrams speaks in Lee Chapel.

Abrams gives views
on Central America

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

The Reagan years have brought
great progress in U.S. efforts to main-
tain and expand democracy in Central
America, according to Elliott
Abrams, the U.S. assistant secretary
of state for inter-American affairs.

A key figure in last summer’s Iran-
Contra hearings, Abrams spoke in Lee
Chapel Thursday night on U.S. for-
eign policy, the growth of democracy
and the narcotics trade in Latin Amer-
ica and the Caribbean.

Only 30 percent of Latin America
was democratic in 1980, according to
Abrams, but he said the percentage
today is closer to 90.

This is ‘*not perfect democracy, but
we are moving clearly’’ in that direc-
tion, he said, because of an across-the-
board policy that involves both pres-
sure and negotiations,

Abrams stressed the need for con-
sistency in dealing with oppressive
governments in Latin America and
called the February cutoff of aid to the
Contras by Congress ‘‘an exceedingly
dumb move.”” He said the removal of
U.S. pressure allowed the Sandinistas
to violate agreements with the Contras
concerning freedom of the press and
opposition parties and to resume
efforts to break unions

Abrams said one of the obstacles to
permanent democracy in the region is
the drug trade, which he called ‘‘an
incredibly profitable industry’* and ‘‘a
threat to political stability and democ
racy.”

‘We're up against something evil,”
he said. **There is no crime they {drug
traffickers] will not commit.”

Abrams said that, to stop the drug
trade, supply and demand must both
be reduced and interdiction efforts
must be increased.

Wealthy drug traffickers and com-
munist-backed guerrillas work closely

together, he said. In Columbia, drug
money supports anti-American
protests, and left-wing guerrillas
protect cocaine laboratories, said
Abrams.

The Reagan administration’s point
man on the Contra aid issue since July
of 1985, Abrams has made frequent
appearances before congressional
committees looking into U.S. support
of the Nicaraguan Resistance.

Testifying in June before the con-
gressional committees investigating
the Iran-Contra affair, Abrams admit-
ted to having misled Congress in ear-
lier testimony about his involvement
in Contra fund-raising activities,
cording to the Washington Post.

Abrams told Congress he made *
great mistake’’ six months on
when he did not tell the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence about
efforts to solicit $10 million for the
Contras from the nation of Brunei

Responding to a question Thursday
night, Abrams said that, when he ap-
peared before the Senate committee,

ac-

he realized Congress “‘clearly
would have wanted to know about”
the solicitation of money from Brunei.

But Abrams said he did not to men
tion that effort because officials from
Brunei had insisted that the deal be
kept secret and because he did not
have the permission of Secretary of
State George Schultz to discuss the
matter.

Abrams joined the executive branch

in 1981 as the assistant secretary of

state responsible for supervising U.S.
involvement in the United Nations.
He was named assistant secretary for
Human Rights and Humanitarian At
fairs less than a year later and re
mained in that position until assuming
his current post

Abrams’ the

project of the W&L Executive Com-
mittee and Interfraternity Council

address was sixth

a joint

set, but shook free of Roberts to win
7-5. McLeod left no questions in the
second set though, slamming Roberts
6-1

McLeod, although not highly ran-
ked in either category, will compete in
both singles and doubles competition,
starting today. Sophomore John Mor-
ris, who will also see second-half ac-
tion in both singles and doubles, lost
to UCSC’s No. 4 netter, Matt Nagle.
The first set was quite close, with
Morris and Nagle trading leads
throughout. Nagle won the tie-breaker
7-2 to take the first set 7-6.

Morris struggled in the second, and
could not rally. Nagle upped the
"Slugs score to 3-1 by closing out his
match against Morris 6-2.

Intent on a national title, Chris Wi-
man took on Jordan Einbinder at No.
5 singles. Einbinder was undefeated
this entire season with a 24-0 record
including the tournament, but Wiman
was not intimidated.

Wiman, who will play doubles with
Morris, grabbed the first set 6-4. Ein-
binder rallied in the second to keep the
match alive, jumping out 6-2. Wiman
returned in the third to keep the Gen-
eral’s national championship hopes
alive, winning 6-3.

Earl Cole fit right in with the fresh-
men class. In the register, he’s posed
in a coat and a tie, smiling from his
high school graduation picture. Like
the rest of the freshmen, he listed his
home town, high school, potential
major, and extracurricular interests.

Unlike the rest of the freshmen,

"CO hasn't been rushed” studied’ for

final exams or watched the sun set
from the parkway.

“Instead of starting school, he has
been working 24-hours-a-day surviv-
ing,’ said Anne Bunai, his mother, in
a recent interview.

Intoxicated, driving over the speed
limit, Cole crashed into a tractor
trailer one night last July. He was on
his way home from a W&L, pre-rush,
Delta Tau Delta fraternity party.

Cole’s right leg and his pelvis were
severely injured. He also suffered a
severe blow to his head, resulting in
extensive neural injuries.

He spent the next two and a half
months in intensive care at the Bryn

Deaver

to speak
tonight

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

 

For the second time in a week, a key
Reagan administration official will
speak at W&L as part of the Contact
lecture series.

Michael Deaver, the former deputy
White House chief of staff who Time
magazine said knows Ronald Reagan
better than any man alive, will speak
tonight at 7:30 in Lee Chapel on the
successes and failures of the Reagan
presidency.

Deaver’s address comes just one
week after Contact presented a speech
by Iran-Contra figure Elliott Abrams,
the U.S. assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs.

Deaver served on the president's
staff from 1981 until May of 1985,
when he left the White House and
opened his own public relations and
lobbying firm, Michael K. Deaver and
Associates.

But, despite his status as a profes-
sional lobbyist, Deaver has main-
tained his close ties with the president,
and suspicions that Deaver may have
used his fr iendship with Reagan illega-
lly led to an investigation by Indepen-
dent Counsel Whitney North Sey-
mour.

Although he was never charged
with illegal lobbying, Deaver was ac-
cused of perjury and was eventually
convicted on charges of lying to a
House subcommittee and a federal
grand jury investigating his lobbying

Action from this week’s NCAA Division III National Championship Tournament.

Prospective freshman struggles
to regain memory after accident

lowed by a seven month stint as an in-
patient there.

Cole had to re-learn every bodily
function. In October, three and a half
months after the accident, he finally
learned to swallow. The neurons in
Cole’s brain were beginning a long
process of repair and regeneration.

Cole was unable to recognize peo-
ple and remember events for six
months. *‘He couldn’t remember what
whe, had for breakfast,’’ Bunai_ said,

“You had a feeling that he wasn’t
there.”’ The doctors at Bryn Mawr
were not optimistic about Cole’s re-
covery.

But on January 10, Cole re-
membered having visitors. He became
aware of his surroundings and his
conditions. Cole was determined to
recover.

Physical, occupational, cognitive
and speech therapy is helping Cole put
his life back together. Now, he walks
with a walker. He speaks slowly but
understandably.

“*He’s absolutely a miracle,”’
Bunai.

said

*“*My next goal is to walk with a
cane,’’ Cole said in a recent inter-
view. ‘‘Then I'll be by myself, alone.

I can’t wait until that.”’

Bunai openly refers to her son’s ac-
cident as a tragedy. Cole was an ex-
ceptional student, she said. In addi-
tion, he was recruited to play lacrosse
for the Generals.

The accident also took a toll on his
family. They had to drive for three
and a half hours to visit Cole at the
hospital. In April, Cole went home.
But he still must be driven to the hos-
pital for 16 hours of therapy every
week.

Economic challenges are also threa-
tening. According to Bunai, the bill
will total $4 million before Cole is
completely recovered. Cole luckily
has exceptional life insurance cover-
age, said Bunai.

Bunai hopes that some good comes
of Cole’s tragedy. First, she hopes
young people will stop ignoring the
consequences of driving under the in-
fluence.

Bunai said that most of the patients
at Bryn Mawr Rehabilitation Hospital
are 15 to 25 years old, just about the
age of most college students. Furth-
ermore, most were victims of car or
motorcycle accidents.

Bunai said that young adults fail to
properly gage risks when they decide

to drive after drinking.

“Teenagers are fatalistic,’’ she
said, ‘‘They say, ‘if it’s my time to
come, it’s my time to come.**’

“Kids think about people dying and
people surviving, but they never think
about what people who survive are
like. There are so many kids who will
never think, love, relate, walk
again,’ she said.

Bunai also hopes that young people
will stop friends from driving drunk.
She realizes that her son was respon-
sible for himself; but, she is disturbed
because a fraternity president and an-
other student walked Cole to his car
before he left for home. They must
have noticed that he was heavily intox-
icated, she said.

“Take the courage to sa,’ something
to someone,” she said. ** Not saying it
is a great risk. One doesn’t realize that
he has saved an accident from happen-
ing.

“They say that once you had a
closed head injury, you’re never the
same again,’’ she continued. Still,
Bunai looks forward to the day her son
may be able to attend his first college
class, in January, 1989.

“Earl is doing very well,’’ she said,
“but he’s got a long way to go.”’

Art Farm is more than a gallery

Just off of Route 39, only a couple
of miles out of Lexington, one will
find what appears on the outside to be
a quaint, pleasant-looking country
house situated at the top of a hill with
a farmhouse and garden off to the
side.

Such houses are common in Lexing
ton, but within this farmhouse is
something unique, the likes of which
are not apt to be found in any other
farmhouse for miles around

This farmhouse contains over 100
works by I-Hsiung Ju, Artist-in
Residence at W&L. Ju

came here

from the University of Connecticut in
1969 and has been teaching art here
ever since.

In 1975 he, his family and seven of
his art students took up residence in
the house on the hill, and set to work
remodeling the adjacent farmhouse.

“We worked, redoing the founda
tion, repaired the walls and roof, put
glass in the windows...but no heat

Tomorrow afternoon, a dedication ceremony will be held in the
gatehouse of Gaines Residence Hall. Members of the Board of
Trustees, President Wilson, and others will be present as the son of
Francis Pendleton Gaines unveils a memorial plaque honoring the
man who was president of the university for years and whose name
was chosen to grace the newest living accomodations on campus.

 

It seems amazing to some residents of the building that this day is
finally arriving. We have been living in Gaines Hall since Septem-
ber, waiting for all of the construction to be finished and the build-
ing to work out some of the kinks which seem to be unavoidable in
new construction.

Residents arrived at the beginning of the school year expecting to
find a completed, or nearly completed, residence facility. Instead,
we found poor paint jobs, disabled furniture, a non-functioning ele-
vator, no sidewalks, a quad area which looked as though it could be
the location for the next Mid-Atlantic Championship Mud Wres-
tling tournament, a laundry room which wasn’t ready for use, no
weight room as promised, malfunctioning fire alarms (individual
units and the building system as a whole), less than adequate park-
ing space and a gatehouse lounge area which was nowhere near fin-
ished.

We kept hearing predictions. ‘Gaines will be completed in mid-
September.’’ ‘‘Gaines should be finished in time for homecoming
weekend.’ ‘‘They’re planning to completely finish Gaines before
Parents’ Weekend.’’ ‘‘Maybe Gaines will be finished when we get
back from Thanksgiving break.’’ ‘“‘Maybe Gaines will be finished
when we get back from Christmas break.”’ ‘‘Maybe Gaines will be
finished when we get back from February Break...”’

Maybe Gaines wasn’t finished until Alumni Weekend when they
finished installing banisters on every outdoor stairway and finally
replaced all the individual room smoke alarms.

Maybe the residents of Gaines have been dealing with having
construction workers wandering the hallways, entering rooms with
no prior notice to the residents to install the new fire alarms or to in-
spect furniture or do any number of smaller jobs.

Maybe the residents of Gaines have been awakened at all hours of
the morning by construction crews cutting bricks or drilling holes in
walls or nailing things together, or awakened at all hours of the
night by building fire alarms which go off for no apparent reason,
such as this morning at about 2:30 a.m. Maybe the scarier thing is
that at times when the alarm does go off, people literally sleep right
through it without hearing a thing.

Maybe the residents of Gaines contracted to live there expecting
to have full use of the computer facilities, which were not installed
until halfway through the year, or the weight room, which was not
ready in September.

Maybe the residents of Gaines had been led to believe that there
would be more than two kitchens in the dorm for the use of nearly
250 residents, and maybe residents of Gaines thought it to be a
reasonable expectation that there not be mice inside the building,
and that toilets would not get stopped up on a regular basis.

Maybe the residents of Gaines are entitled to a partial refund on
their room rent for the year, as they did not receive all the benefits
‘ understood in their room contract.

Maybe the contractor, J.M. Turner Co., will finish a job on time
one day. They certainly haven’t succeeded in completing the Gil-
liam Admissions House on schedule, either.

And maybe, just maybe, when it comes time to select a contractor
for the Performing Arts Center, W&L will choose one who can
fulfill an agreement and have a building completed when they have
promised it.

This will be the last issue of The Ring-tum Phi for the 1987-88

As I begin my last article of the
academic year, my hand trembles just
as Daniel Webster's did when he star-
ted the last page of the unabridged dic-
tionary. Many historians believe
Dan’s hand was trembling because he
was nostalgic and sad that his work
was nearing completion. But recently
uncovered documents reveal that
Dan’s trembling stemmed from ex-
citement over some beers he stashed
in the refrigerator for the dictionary
victory party. Many historians will
later explain my trembling hand as
they did Dan’s, but the truth is that I
just slammed it in a car door. Being as
this is the last issue I have a lot (more
than usual) of deranged observations,
statements and rumors to share with
the reader.

life forms have had their heroes. Even
low life forms such as blue green al-
gae and humans have heroes. How
one becomes a hero and how heroes
are distinguished from the masses are
questions that must be answered. In
scientific terms a hero is someone who
makes his friends look bad and is
therefore allowed to mate with the en-
tire herd, pack, or suburb. Humans
usually make their friends look bad by
performing a marvelous feat which
their friends cannot emulate. Eating a
three speed bike with a banana seat for

time.”’

Here’s a copy of the letter I wrote
back:

‘‘Dear State Dept.:

I am ignoring your comments con-
cerning my personal friends. The
president's friends embarrass me, but
do I ever mention it? Now here’s the
information you needed on the W&L
community. The student body, once
beyond the iron claw of the oppressive
Executive Committee, will embark on
a summer of vandalism, drug use, fist
fights, shoplifting and anything else
considered deviant by moral majority
advocates. I know the forecast looks
grim but wait—it gets worse. Because
by the time you read this letter mem-
bers of the faculty and administration
will be exchanging their polyester
pants, starchy suits and fat ties for critical. Here’s what my first English
torn blue jeans and leather jackets as professor had to say about my first es-

because it’s a marvelous feat and'most
friends don’t have the digestive tract,

selves. A heroic feat far more difficult
than eating bikes and one that I will
discuss at length concerns college. As
many of you probably guessed the
heroic feat I mean is fulfilling re-
quired college curriculum. Any stu-
dent who can actually do this defin-
itely deserves to mate with his (or her)
whole suburb.

One of the most painful parts of col-
lege curriculum is the English litera-
ture requirements. English classes are
usually fine until the unsuspecting
freshman writes his first paper. The
problem with writing essays is that
English professors can be a little

Because my correspondence with
the State Dept. speaks for itself, I will
move on to other topics.

You know, college isn’t for everyone.
If Herman Melville had known people
like you would write essays like this

about him he probably would have gi-
ven up writing and worked for the
government. Giving you a C minus on
this paper is charity. I deserve a tax
break! The only good thing about this
paper is the topic and I assigned it!”’

Another aspect of college curricu-
lum is the greatly feared laboratory
science requirement. Due to the fact
that both my parents have science-
related degrees, I figured that I
couldn’t perform too poorly in a col-
lege science class so instead of ‘‘Dirt
Ecology’’ I took a pre-med biology
class. (Pre-med basically means that a
student taking sucha class under-
stands that he or she will be studying
incredibly boring subjects 12 hours a
night for the next 12 years.) In the bio-
logy class I soon learned that even
though my parents were good at
science they carried the ‘‘bad at scien-
ce’’ gene recessively; and when they
had me these recessive traits hooked-
up. Non-scientific translation for poe-
try majors: even if your father is Al-
bert Einstein and every other relative
is a Nobel prize winner in science,
you can still fail high school Earth
Science. It was during the first labora-
tory exercise that I realized that I was
a scientific idiot. The rest of the class
did the lab in twenty minutes. I strug-
gled with my microscope for three
hours until the instructor finally came
over (probably he wanted to deter-
mine what type of mental retardation
afflicted my brain) to help me get star-
ted. His first suggestion was that I turn
on the microscope light. At that point I
knew I had problems.

English and Science are tough re-
quirements to fulfill, but compared to
math, they were a cinch. In my case,
the math requirement reared its ugly
head in the form of calculus. To pass a
calculus class one requires the bore-
dom capacity of a rock. Not only is

 

LETTERS
Senior has his final say on coeducation

calculus boring, but it is perhaps the
most irrelevant thing since a seed-spit-
ting contest. Knowing this, imagine
how surprised I was when a calculus
teacher told me that my articles are ir-
relevant. Of course, the teacher was
correct. Everything I write is irrele-
vant, but irrelevance is relative and
compared to calculus, my articles are
the most relevant invention since the
electric can opener. Wait a second!
Maybe I’ve been too hard on calculus.

Actually, it’s very useful to the econ-"

omy because it keeps people from
quitting their boring jobs. Winston,
the:beer mug-inspector and his career
dilemma exhibits the point. One morn-
ing Winston woke up and decided to
quit his job inspecting beer mugs for
leaks because it is so boring. Suddenly
he remembers how much worse the
calculus class he took in college was
and ends up going to work thankful to
have such an interesting job. Thanks
to calculus America still makes quality
beer mugs.

The moral of my story on heroic
acts is that it is much easier to become
a hero by eating a three speed bike
with a banana seat than fulfilling re-
quired college curriculum.

The last important topic of this arti-
cle is a question which gets to the very
heart of everything bad journalism
stands for: ‘‘Why does Jon Sbar per-
sist in writing articles which violate
every law of responsible journalism?”
Unfortunately, the reader’s guess is as
good as mine, but if it’s any comfort a
team of America’s best psychiatrists is
currently working on the problem. In
closing out the year, I would like to
end with the immortal words of War-
ren Dunn, world famous philosopher,
womanizer, and skateboarder, *‘Life
is a fruit to be eaten because if you
don’t it will get squashed under
someone’s foot.’’

 

 

fo the Editors:

I wish to call attention to some of the most seri-
ous problems facing our university, but first I
must address the source of our difficulties; coedu-
cation.

Why were females allowed to infest the Colon-
nade? The university has consistently responded
with the following; W&L is not attracting the ca-
liber of students it prefers. My contention is that
there is always more than one solution to a prob-
lem. W&L should have recruited prospective stu-
dents more intensively. While many of my fellow
seniors are from Virginia and neighboring states,
very few came into contact with a W&L rep-
resentative. Although many came to visit W&L,
even more didn’t, and a sizeable majority never
even heard of Saint Bob’s University. W&L took
the easy way out and now we are paying dearly
for it.

One only needs to look at the 1987-88 academic
year to observe the divisiveness that now pervades
our hallowed halls, e.g., the Fancy Dress scandal,
the sorority dispute, the Trident controversy-
Winter Slosh & Confetti's and so on. W&L has
traditionally been attended by conservative Repu-
blican God-fearing men. If you didn’t know that
when you decided to enroll, you can blame Wash-
ington Hall for their completely inadequate re-

cruitment policy. If you don’t like it...get the hell
out.

By appealing to a wider base of prospective stu-
dents, W&L is the prime culprit in allowing th.
commie pinko liberals (synonyms) to flood the
conservative halls of our institution. If you fear
the red tide lapping at America’s shores, you bet-
ter be prepared to do battle right here in Lexing-
ton. I implore the male population at W&L to sus-
tain and intensify the crusade against coeducation,
and in the words of Gen. Douglas MacArthur,
‘There is no substitute for victory.’’ Although I
believe there is a place for women in the world,
the only position female students should occupy at
W&L is prone. Washington & Lee has turned its
back on us, one only need wonder whether in 15
years we will do the same.

Mark A. Keene ‘88
Al celebrates human rights

To the Editors:
It is sad that in a time and age in which we have
the most to offer to the world, that we think so

little of it outside of our cozy little existence. We
have everything at our fingertips and very few of
us seek to use this for the betterment of others. On
Monday evening, the Rev. Benoni Ogwal and his
wife, Alice Ogwal, and Prof. Neville Richardson
and his wife, Carleen Richardson, gave a moving
testimony to the abuses of basic human rights that
we take for granted in our world of BMW’s and
Wednesday-night parties.

They spoke of the suffering and seemingly
hopeless plight of people in parts of Africa. Alth-
ough their message was bleak, the spark of hope
that underlined it can be turned into a raging fire,
if people can learn to think beyond themselves and
care for others. Join Amnesty International this
Saturday, weather permitting, along with Live
Drive, as we will be having an all-day concert in
front of Lee Chapel. Food and drinks will be ser-
ved until we run out. Together we can make that
spark grow.

Sincerely,
Kevin D. McNamara ‘88

es Ps _
By W. Patrick Hinely/W&L

Dr. Robert T. Schooley, associate professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School
and a W&L alumnus, discussed AIDS research with W&L students, faculty, and other
medical professionals during the annual Medical Ethics Institute, held at the university last
weekend. The institute is part of W&L’s program in applied ethics, ‘‘Society and the

Professions.’’

Students split history award

 

From Staff Reports

 

Two W&L students, Kevin L.
Yeager of Mercersburg, Pa., and John
H. Starks Jr. of Valdosta, Ga., have
been named co-recipients of the So-
ciety of the Cincinnati Award.

The award, established in honor of
the Society of Cincinnati in the State
of Virginia, is conferred by the faculty
of W&L on the author of the best es-
say in American military history or
some other subject in Colonial, Revo-
lutionary or Civil War history of the
United States. For the first time since
its establishment, the Cincinnati
Award is being conferred on two stu-

dents.

Yeager, a junior history major, was
honored for his paper, ‘‘For ‘A
National Union More Complete’:
John Brown Gordon, the Legacy of
the Civil War and Sectional Recon-
ciliation.’’ Yeager was also the reci-
pient of the Cincinnati Award in 1987.
He is the son of Mr. and Mrs. David
R. Yeager of Mercersburg.

Starks, a senior majoring in
classics, was honored for his paper,
‘**This Ancient and Venerable Seat of
the Muses: the Classics at the Eight-
eenth Century Precursors of Washing-
ton and Lee University.’’ Starks is the
son of Mr. and Mrs. John Starks of
Valdosta, Ga.

Former Justice Lewis Powell
will address law graduation

 

From Staff Reports

 

Retired U.S. Supreme-Court Justice
Lewis F. Powell Jr. will deliver the
address at commencement exercises
of the W&L School of Law on Sun-
day, May 22.

The ceremony will be held at 2:30
p.m. on the lawn in front of the Presi-
dent’s House. In the event of rain, the
ceremony will be moved to Warner
Center.

W&L expects to award juris doctor
degrees to 117 third-year students.
This will be the university’s 133rd
graduating law class.

Powell received his undergraduate
degree (1929) and law degree (1931)
from W&L. He received his master of
laws degree from Harvard University

and received an honorary degree from
WA&L in 1960. One of the university’s
most distinguished and loyal alumni,
Powell served-onits’board of trustees
from 1961 to 1978.

Powell was admitted to’the Virginia
Bar Association in 1931. He was a
member of the Special Charter Com-
mission for the City of Richmond in
1947 and the Governor’s Advisory
Council on the Virginia Economy,
and is a former president of the Amer-
ican Bar Association. He also served
as chairman of the Richmond Public
School Board.

Powell practiced law in Richmond
for 34 years before accepting the
nomination to the U.S. Supreme
Court in 1972 at the age of 64. He re-
tired from the Supreme Court last
June.

practices, according to the Washing-
ton Post.

Specifically, Deaver was convicted
of lying to the House Energy and
Commerce oversight committee about
his role in setting up a meeting be-
tween a South Korean trade rep-
resentative and President Reagan, the
Post reported.

He was also convicted of lying to
the grand jury about contacts he made
with government officials on behalf of
Trans World Airlines and about his
efforts to help Puerto Rico retain a
federal tax benefit, according to the
Post.

Deaver faced up to I5 years in
prison and $22,000 in fines, but his
sentencing, originally set for Feb. 25,
was delayed by challenges to the con-

stitutionality of the law that created
independent counsellors.

During the highly publicized trial,
Deaver’s lawyers decided to offer no
defense, because they believed the
prosecutor’s case was weak and be-
cause Judge Thomas Jackson disal-
lowed much of the evidence they had
planned to use to show Deaver was
under the effects of alcoholism when
he originally testified, according to
the Post.

Deaver began his association with
the president during the 1960s, when
Reagan was governor of California.
Deaver first worked as a cabinet se-
cretary and went on to serve as an as-
sistant to the governor and director of
administration.

Since leaving the White House,
Deaver wrote Behind the Scenes, an
insider’s look at the workings of the
Reagan presidency.

Tonight’s speech is open to the pub-
lic and will be followed by a reception
in Fairfax Lounge in the University
Center.

**T let them [students] know that the

times they come even with their girl-
friends. Some have lived with me for
up to five years,”’ said Ju.

The student who resides with the Ju
family, either over the summer or dur-
ing the academic school year, is in for
a unique experience. He may take les-
sons, usually held in the morning or
afternoon, and receive individual at-
tention from Ju in a relaxed, uncrow-
ded environment. The number of stu-
dents per class is limited to ten.

Students may learn just about any
type of art from Ju, from landscapes
to flower paintings. There are many
varicties of flowers to draw from

growing in the garden beside the gal-
lery.

Mrs. Ju offers cooking lessons as
well. Many of the meals fixed at the Ju
household will likely have been pre-
pared by one of the students, with the
instruction and assistance of Mrs. Ju.

June is one of the busiest times of
the year, when students come to live
with Ju and take lessons from him.
His pupils aren't just limited to W&L
students, either.

Ju says adult students from around
the Lexington area take summer and
weekend lessons, and still more travel
from as far away as Washington,
D.C. to take lessons on a weekly
basis.

The family atmosphere and _ the
beautiful nature spread out across
some eight acres of land make this
place different than the usual gallery

As Ju said, **We are all like a family
here...It is a place to raise young ar-
tists.””

Two W&L students earn philosophy awards

 

From Staff Reports

 

Two W&L students have been
awarded prizes for their excellent
scholarship in philosophy.

Gregg W. Kettles, a senior from
Colorado Springs, Colo., has been
named the recipient of the Young
Scholarship, which is conferred upon
the student attaining the highest record
in a selected course in philosophy.
Kettles plans to enter Yale Law
School next fall. He is the son of Mr.
and Mrs. William Kettles of Colorado
Springs.

Henry H. Hyatt. a senior from Rose

Hill, has been awarded the Edward A
Dodd Award. Hyatt is the first reci
pient of the Dodd Award, which was
recently established in memory or
Edward A. Dodd, a 1967 W&L gra-
duate who died in 1985. Hyatt will
continue graduate study in philosophy
at the University of California at Santa
Barbara. He is the son of Frederick D.
Hyatt of Rose Hill, and Sandra Berry
of Ocracoke, N.C.

The Edward A. Dodd Award was
established through the generous con-
tributions of W&L alumni who were
friends and classmates of Dodd. The
Edward A. Dodd Award is presented
annually to the graduating W&L
senior whose senior thesis exemplifies

the highest standards in the study of
philosophy.

According to the description of the
award, the recipient should possess
the qualities Dodd demonstrated while
he was a student at W&L. Among
these qualities are ‘‘academic excel-
lence motivated by a concern for ideas
for their own sake, vigor in intellec-
tual-pursuit and resilience in the face
of criticism, good will toward others
encouraging them to higher achieve-
ment, and courage in the face of mis-
fortune.”

One of Dodd’s former teachers at
W&L, Professor of Philosophy Harr-
ison H. Pemberton Jr., said of Dodd,
‘Several of us can remember him

his honors thesis. His thesis was ex-
cellent and we had a vigorous and
engrossing discussion of it—a genuine
philosophic inquiry.

‘It was with that excellent perfor-
mance in mind that we have arranged
to have the memorial award granted to
the student who most closely approx-
imates Ed's achievement. Ed was an
exemplar when he was here. Now his
example will continue to motivate,
stimulate, and challenge generations
of students,’* Pemberton added.

New politics

New Zealand political scientist
Nigel Roberts will speak on size
and democracy in 121 Commerce
School at 2:00 p.m. on Thursday,
May 26. The lecture is sponsored
by the Politics dept. and the public
invited.

This illustrated lecture probes
the appropriate scale for a demo-

the media, and women’s rights.

Roberts has met these issues
head-on as a refusenik from South
Africa. Professors are asked to an-
nounce this rare and timely visit to
their classes. Contact Professor
Craig McCaughrin (463-8624) for

W&L head coach Gary Franke was

» concerned about his doubles combina-
tions. Due to time constraints placed
on the teams by the rainy conditions,
only one W&L doubles pairs had
played a match during the tournament
(Wiman and Morris won
Emory on Monday).

Needing a sweep to win the crown,
the Generals, possibly rusty, had their
work cut out for them. Things did
seem to a little out of syne early, as
only Haley and Meadows won their
first set.

At No. 3 for W&L, Haley and
Meadows gave the slumping Generals
some much-needed momentum with a
straight set win over UCSC’s An-
drews and John Browning. The W&L
duo needed a tie- breaker before win-
ning the first set 7-6 (7-5). The two
oT then went on to take the second

. The team score moved to 4-3 as

against

the Generals marched on.

Matthews and McLeod spotted Na-
gle and Einbinder the first set, losing
4-6. Action got intense in the second,
as the cornered W&L pair scrapped to
keep its team in the hunt. Santa Cruz
had its only championship point in the
second set, with the ‘Slugs serving at
5 games to 4. In that tenth game, the
score went to 3-all before Matthews
and McLeod denied the Slugs the
national title.

Breaking UCSC’s No. | pair, Matt-
hews and McLeod stomped on the
gas, securing the second set in a 9-7
tie breaker and then smoking the
‘Slugs in the third set, 6-2. The Gen-
erals remained alive, tying the fierce
competition at 4-4. The small but
vocal W&L crowd pushed its team
further on.

Wiman and Morris, W&L’s com-
bination punch at No. 2, also allowed
their opponents an early lead. UCSC’s
Roberts and Frederick jumped out
quickly, breezing to a 6-3 first set vic-
tory.

Again the Generals found their
hopes flickering. The No. 2 W&L
pair kept the ‘Slugs from any cham-
pionship points, winning the long sec-
ond set 7-6 (9-7) in a heart-wrenching
tie breaker. Wiman and Morris earned
the right to play in that tie breaker
after gallantly fighting back from a 4
games to | deficit. Following much
the same pattern as the No. | game,

the ’Slugs folded in the third set. The
W&L pair closed out the team compe-
tition, winning the third set 6-3.

Franke was excited with the big
win, and said that ‘‘it couldn’t have
happened to a nicer group of young
men.’’. The frustration of two consecu-
tive second-place finishes drained
from the players’ faces as Morris’
clinching serve was shanked into the
net by the ‘Slugs. Washington and Lee
had won its first ever national title.

Rain also played havoc with the
Generals’ semifinal contest against
Swarthmore on Tuesday.

W&L clinched a spot in the final
battle for the national title by winning
all five singles matches played.

Haley’s match at No. 2 against
Steve Tignor was called due to rain,
and doubles play was not begun.

The Generals, seeded second in the
tournament, had a bye on Sunday, the
first day of play. Old foe Emory
greeted W&L on Monday afternoon.
The No. 10 Eagles had upset No. 7
Claremont to advance.

W&L won the match 5-2, with
Matthews losing to singles power Ji-
mmy Strauss [6-4, 6-7 (7-9), 1-6] at
No. | and Meadows dropping to
Emory’s Chris Walser 6-3, 4-6, 4-6.
W&L’s five wins all came in straight
sets. W&L had beaten Emory during
regular season play 8-1.

Something strange happened last night in a small racquet club in
Staunton. One would almost liken the occurrence to a miracle.

The Generals were beaten. W&L trailed 4-2 after the singles competi-
tion against the Banana Slugs of the University of California-Santa Cruz
in the Division II Men’s Tennis Championships. Surely the *Slugs
would wrap up the team title in the doubles. All they needed was a single
victory in one of the three matches.

Any glimmer of a possible miracle was quickly darkened as the No. |
and No. 2 doubles tandems for UCSC jumped out to an early lead, grab-
bing the first set in their respective matches. Before the Generals could
even regroup the “Slugs had widened their advantage, with both teams
breaking W&L’s serve. Only the No. 3 doubles team of junior Robert
Haley and freshman Bill Meadows seemed out of danger, winning its
match in straight sets.

All UCSC had to do was hold serve, something it had done quite well
all afternoon and evening, and it would have the national title. For the
Generals, the defeat would mean the third consecutive year of finishing
second in the nation.

As the “Slugs prepared to close out the match, I looked at my watch,
which said 10:31. An omen perhaps? If you add the first three digits and
divide by thelast one you come up with the number 4, which is the aver-

‘itthy Banana Stig. It 1 also the number

of sets the Generals needed for a nstonal utle.

Nah, it wasn’t an omen. The Generals were finished—history. Some
Santa Cruz fans edged towards the doors leading to the courts, anticipat-
ing the forthcoming celebration. W&L supporters started wondering
how far junior Bobby Matthews and senior David McLeod would go in
the doubles competition later in the week. Nope, it was over. Pack up
the bus. Send them home.

I envisioned the next day's headline. ‘‘General’s choke :n finals.
What else is new?’’ At a school where ‘tyakkin’ at the bone’’ (as one
person puts it) has become almost as common place as white columns
and anti-coed letters, it would probably come as no surprise that the
Generals had lost again.

What happened over those next fateful SO minutes was something to
behold. I have never experienced anything like it. To traverse from the
depths of failure to the heights of success in a mere 3000 seconds just
couldn't be done. The Generals were out of it. They could barely hold
their own serve, less not break the opposition’s.

Throughout the history of sport, people have labeled certain sporting
events as “‘the greatest comeback ever."’ What 30 some odd people say
yesterday at that tiny little indoor tennis facility would certainly chal-
lenge any claim to that title.

No, the Generals did not choke. Instead they conjured up some magic,
made a few gut checks and pulled off the most incredible clutch I’ve
ever seen. It was if a divine power sucked up the confidence and mo-
mentum from the Santa Cruz players and dumped them into the Gen-
eral’s laps.

I guess the omen wasn’t that silly equation I came up with after look-
ing at my watch. The real omen was the drinking cup I picked up at one
of those everything’s-a-dollar stores in the shopping mall during the
two-hour break between the singles and doubles. At the time, I saw that
drinking cup as just a meaningless trinket. Now, it represents the victory
cup from which everyone can drink from and celebrate this absolutely
incredible performance.

Here’s a toast first, however, to the players from Santa Cruz. You
didn’t choke. Remember, it’s not everyday you have to play a miracle.

Faust Food

Lexington gets a new taste of China

 

By Jason Faust

Staff Reporter

 

Chinese food is back and is better
than ever, unfortunately you're going
to have to pay for it. It took just one
day to hear that the rumors were true
to start calling and harassing the orien-
tal man on the other end of the line to
open as quickly as possible. Then the
day finally came...Hunan Gardens
had opened its doors for business!!
The grand occasion filled Lexington’s
chinese-food-void created by the
dearly departed Aloha Wok about two
years ago, a grim occasion which until
now was sadly mourned by many
seniors.

Now, I don’t know how difficult
Chinese food is to cook; It seems to
me that anything stir-fried is going to
taste delicious. In fact, I can’t re-
member ever having any bad Chinese
food and after more than a few trips to
Hunan Gardens | still can’t. To put it
frankly, the food is wonderful and
recommend everything on the menu
except for the dishes with peanuts, but

Hopper’s

Colors, colors, colors. Blacks,
whites, reds, yellows and browns.
The Reds. The Blues. The Crips and
the Bloods.

With every new month, it seems,
comes a new ‘‘Buzz Word’’ for the
80s. First it was yuppy, then it was
AIDS and Crack. What next? Some-
thing that needs no abbreviation and
something that cannot be smoothed
over with a sugar-coated colloquial-
ism. The new ‘‘Buzz Word’’ for the
80s is ‘‘Street Gang.”’

What was once a not-so-serious,
pseudo-tough, don’t push me or Ill
push you turf battle between the Jets
and the Sharks with zip-guns and
switchblades has become an epidemic-
sized drug war among American
youths involving Uzi machine guns,
grenades, 9mm handguns and over
70,000 youths in Los Angeles alone.

Gang violence has once again risen
out of the streets and it is more serious
and more deadly than it has ever been
before. It was part of the cover story
for Time magazine two weeks ago, a
major story in a Rolling Stone-like
British publication called Sky last
month and is the subject of the new
Dennis Hopper film Colors that is
taking Hollywood by storm.

Colors is the story of a wet-nosed
special forces cop (Sean Penn) who
joins forces with a veteran policeman
(Robert DuVall) to learn the ropes on
how to crack down on the gang wars
exploding all over Los Angeles.

Just as he showed us in Apocalypse
Now and in his Oscar-winning per-

this is a personal bias and in no way
should influence your decision. Many
people enjoy seafood dishes, as do I
but, when you can choose from a
number of spicy entres such as Beef in
Garlic sauce, Hunan Two Step, and
Szechuan Pork the seafood sounds and
tastes somewhat bland. Though the
consistency of the spiciness has varied
the two times I ordered the Beef in
Garlic sauce, keep in mind that if you
don't care for really hot foods you
may ask the waitress to pass the word
onto the sometimes over-zea'ous
cook. Thus you have no reason not 9
try anything on the menu.

The menu includes appetizers whicn
I have found, to my dismay, rather
sub par in comparison to the main di-
shes. The egg roll is the standard $1
egg roll. When I went for the first
time I was enticed by the exotic sound-
ing Beef Yakitori. Unfortunately it
was basically, a stripe of beef on an
oversized toothpick which you eat
after heating it over a Sterno, I mean
open flame. I did manage to jazz it up
with soy but it was still dry and not
very tender and at $2.25 a pop, some-
thing I will consider next time. I did
enjoy the Pu Pu tray for two which‘
comes with a plethora of friend things
including two spare ribs and yes two

formance in Tender Mercies, Robert
DuVall again displays the talent that
has included him in the fraternity of
America’s finest actors. His portrayal
of the fatherly Hodges is played just as
you would expect a laid-back cop to
act; caring but tough enough to con-
trol any situation he must handle. In
short, DuVall is nearly perfect.

Unfortunately, as is often the case
in film, when one actor shows serious
maturity over previous roles, perfect
performances are neglected. In regard
to DuVall’s performance inColors,
this is what happens.

In Colors, Sean Penn finally reaches
the potential that many critics said he
had after his portrayal of Spicoli in
Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Since
then a series of obstacles (getting ar-
rested numerous times, marrying Ma-
donna and acting in such utter disas-
ters as Shanghai Surprise to name a
few) have limited Penn’s acceptance
in the golden circles of Hollywood.
Colors may change all that.

Penn’s performance as the wet-
nosed, hard-headed Pac-man, as he
was called on the streets, was no ques-
tion his finest since Fast Times and
probably of his career. For the first
time, he shows us that Sean Penn can
play emotions and is not merely one-
dimensional. His character de-
velopment, the control over his emo-
tions and the thorough maturation of
his character throughout the film is in-
credibly well-done.

Colors succeeds because DuVall
and Penn succeed; yet, without strong
performances from them the film may
have worked due to its utter poig-
nancy. Gang violence is increasing
and Colors deals with what we must
do to stop it. Last year in Los Angeles
alone 387 people were killed as a re-
sult of gang violence including in-

Beef Yakitori’s but for $7.95 it is
plenty of food, as an appetizer goes, to
accompany Chinese dish more than
adequately.

But all is not so charming in Lexing-
ton’s Chinatown. To me, a Chinese
restaurant should be dimly lit and real-
ly tacky. Hunan Gardens, to my cha-
grin, is not; it is brightly illuminated
by numerous florescent lights with not
even a toke candle burning in a weird
bamboo thing, for the lack of better
descriptive words. The walls painted,
not a brilliant disgusting Buddhist red-
orange, but white of all colors. (I per-

sonally would like to see murals of

Venetian city-scapes on an aqua-blue
background...well maybe not aqua-
blue) The walls are void of the any ar-
tifacts from the T’ang dynasty or at
least something that can be claimed to
be from the 1980s. There aren't even
bizarre red and gold things hanging
from the ceiling. I may be pushing
things a bit but these are the effects
that make a Chinese meal complete. |
can joyfully say, however, you do sit
in the notorious vinyl-covered chairs
that make that distinctive sound when
you try to get up that in Europe signi-
fies a very satisfied customer.

But to be serious again, Hunan Gar-
dens’s reservation policy leaves some-

fants, five-year-olds and numerous
innocent bystanders. It is an epidemic
that is sweeping over our nation but it
remains to be seen if anyone can find

The Ring-tum Phi, May 19, 1988

thing to be desired. It is basically as
follows: if they can fill a vacant able
five minutes before your reservation it
will be filled. One night we waited an
hour to be seated because another
party strolled in an hour later than
their reservation time and because we
were ten minutes early instead of an
hour they were seated ahead of
us...thank China for Tsing Tao beer.
What I am trying to write is if you
want to eat at Hunan Gardens on the
weekend make reservations and arrive
early. Also, thought he food is great,
you are going to drop a few bucks:
soups and appetizers run from $1.00
to $7.95 and main dishes run about
$5.95 to $9.95 (though one or two di-
shes may cost more). The capper to
any dinner bill is drinks and they are
not cheap. It is so easy to get carried
away and order numerous Flaming
Volcanoes, which will do the trick but
dent your wallet $5.95 a shot. If you
are on the budget plan get carry-out.
The prices aren’t cheaper but you will
eliminate the cost of drinks and I be-
lieve the portions are larger. If the
budget is really strained but you are
determined to eat Chinese, order car-
ry-out at lunchtime and eat then or
microwave it later (Stop-In has a real-
ly nice one if you don’t.)

Colors paints an ugly picture

the cure. After all, as the theme from
the film says, ‘‘We will never die,
We'll only multiply!”’
