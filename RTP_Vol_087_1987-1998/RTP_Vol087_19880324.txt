AIDS symposium
stresses education

Staff Reporter

 

The president of the American
Foundation for AIDS research said
Saturday that more care, research and
education are needed to deal with the
AIDS crisis.

In a lecture in Lee Chapel Dr. Mer-
vyn Silverman, who is a 1960 gra-

duate of W&L,, said there are two as- _

pects of the AIDS crisis—the disease
itself and society’s reaction to it. He
said the reaction includes four phases:
denial, anxiety, blame, and hysteria.

Silverman, who was the director of
public health for the city of San Fran-
cisco when the AIDS epidemic broke
out, said a national policy on AIDS is
desperately needed.

People need to show care and con-
cern for AIDS and its victims, not hys-
teria and barbaric practices, he said.

Silverman talked about cases of
AIDS where victims were physically
and mentally threatened and abused.
Silverman told this story: ‘‘A man in
New York with AIDS was beaten by
neighbors. When he asked his assai-
lants why, they said they were killing
AIDS.”

Silverman’s speech was part of a
weekend AIDS symposium sponsored
by the Telford Lecture series. John S.
Knox, associate professor of Biology
at W&L, said the topic of AIDS was

chosen because of the importance of
the subject.

Knox said that after a symposium on
AIDS last year at W&L, he found that
many students still did not realize the
critical importance of AIDS. ‘Several
students dismissed the subject as not
pertinent to them. They did not under-
stand the magnitude of the problem,”’
he said.

The program also included a lecture

by Harvard Medical School AIDS.

researcher Dr. Robert T. Schooley.
His lecture included a slide presen-
tation on the scientific research being
done on AIDS.

Schooley said, although research is
being done on a vaccine for the AIDS
virus, it does not look likely that on
will ever be found.

Schooley also said there will proba-
bly never be a cure for AIDS because
once you are infected, it becomes
fixed in your genes. He said the
research being done is mostly looking
for a way to keep AIDS victims alive.

He added that AIDS research is
helping to teach a lot about other
diseases, such as cancer.

At the symposium, questions were
written on the back of programs and
read to the speaker by Professor of
Chemistry James K. Shillington, who
introduced the speakers.

Knox said this change was made be-
cause last year there were so few ques-
tions. He said with a topic like AIDS

W&L conducts self-study
as part of re-accreditation

 

By Heidi Read
Staff Reporter

 

Budget, curriculum, facilities,
equipment and minority and women
representation. These factors and oth-
ers will be considered in W&L’s self-
study, a part of the re-accreditation
process.

According to John W. Elrod, dean
of the College, every ten years the
university must evaluate itself to get
re-accredited by the Southern Associa-
tion of Colleges and Schools.

The Commission on Colleges ac-
credits all institutions of higher edu-
cation.

Elrod said membership in the asso-
ciation is voluntary, but most colleges
and universities join.

‘‘Accreditation gives the university
credibility; parents know that their
children are attending universities that
have had their programs closely scru-

 

Mervyn F. Silverman

many people are intimidated but also
have a lot of questions. ‘“The response
from the audience on Saturday was
really good,’’ Knox said.

Questions varied greatly ranging
form what the media’s role in the
AIDS crisis should be to how much
competition there is between AIDS
researchers.

Dr. Richard Keeling, the director of

student health at the University of
Virginia, was scheduled to speak on
Friday night but cancelled because he
was ill.

There was moderate turnout for
Saturday’s lectures. Knox said he
would have liked to have seen more
people there, but the cancellation of
the keynote address was probably a
problem.

University and city to

enforce parking laws

 

By Jon Ryan
Staff Reporter

 

The university and the city will be
cracking down on parking next year,
said junior class Executive Committee
Representative John McDonough.

Also, the 1988 Mock Democratic
Convention and the Liberty Hall Vol-
unteers gave budget reports to the EC.

The university plans to try new
measures to compel freshmen to keep
their cars off Washington Street in
front of the dorms and Evans Dining
Hall.

According to Frank Parsons, execu-
tive assistant to the president, the city
has also announced that it will put
2-hour spots in the area and begin
ticketing and towing offenders.

This news came as part of a report
from the Parking Committee the EC
formed several weeks ago to study the
problem of Washington Street park
ing.

No plans to change the corral are in
progress, according to Parsons.

Parsons said the most likely pros-
pect for parking relief will be to get
spots from VMI

He said VMI is planning to build a
museum and theatre, which would
necessitate a change in their parking.

Parsons said that by VMI’s own es
timates there will be a few dozen addi
tional spots

He said that W&L is willing to give
up parking on Letcher Avenue, a sore
point at VMI, in exchange for 32 re-
served spots in the nearby VMI park-
ing lot.

The Mock Convention is on budget
and doing fine, according to Co-
Chairmen Lester Coe and George
Gist.

The two reported the number of
delegates needed has been cut to ap-
proximately 200, which they said they
considered good.

They also said that the EC should
start considering an interim chairman
for next year.

The interim chairman is responsible
for producing the final report, and
keeping the records from Mock Con-
vention intact.

The Liberty Hall Volunteers have
exhausted their EC allocation and are
seeking more funds.

Members of the group fund many
things out of their own pockets, ac-
cording to representatives from the
group.

The cost of guns in prohibitive,
however, and the group is trying to
build up a stock for use in re-
enactments.

They asked the EC to cover the cost
of another field piece and another tent.

Uniforms, they said, are easily bor-
rowed from VMI and other re-
enactment groups, but guns are lent
more reluctantly

tinized. W&L has been accredited for
hundreds of years,’’ Elrod said.

To become accredited, an institu-
tion must do a self-study in which fa-
culty, students and administrators par-
ticipate.

The study examines all aspects of
the university from the building and
grounds department to the president.

After the self-study is completed a
visiting team appointed by the execu-
tive director of the association comes
to examine the university’s self-study.
They make recommendations to the
Commission on Colleges on the uni-
versity’s re- accreditation.

Some requirements for re-
accreditation include having a certain
percentage of professors with terminal
degrees, (i.e. Ph.D., LL.D.), operat-
ing within the budget, conducting
searches for faculty, admissions re-
quirements, a mission statement that is
carried out by the university and goals
that are stated and met.

According to Elrod, four other de
partments within the university can be
accredited by associations other than
the one that accredits the university as
a whole. The four are: a special sec-
tion of the Chemistry Department, the
Journalism Department, the Law
school and the Commerce school. The
Journalism Department is up for re
accreditation this year.

According to Professor of Journal-
ism Ronald H. MacDonald, the Jour-
nalism Department is re-accredited
every six years. MacDonald said the
journalism department was organized
in 1925 and was in the first group of
schools accredited in 1945.

MacDonald said the departmental
accreditation process is very similar to
that of the university.

brary, the student-teacher ratio and
student job success when they are

Career center has
placed 25 seniors

 

By Stacy Morrison
Staff Reporter

 

Approximately 25 seniors have ac-
cepted jobs through interviews held by
the Career Development and Place-
ment Office this year, said Rick Heat-
ley, director of Career Services.

Senior Jim Cockey, of Scituate,
Mass., accepted a job offer with Sov-
tan Bank of Roanoke, he'said"Cockey
will be starting as a management asso-
ciate for Sovran.

‘‘The Placement Office was hugely
helpful,’’ said Cockey. ‘‘Especially
Mrs. Henneman,’’ he added. Cockey
was called back for second interviews
with five companies out of five inter-
views.

‘This senior class has used the ser-
vices very well,’’ said Heatley. 183 of
approximately 200 seniors registered
with the Placement Office, said Heat-
ley.

Senior Mike Hassinger, of Atlanta,
Ga., plans to go to law school next
year. He said he did not use the
Placement Office because he ‘‘didn’t
need to.’’ Senior Tom Langheim, of
Salem, Va., agrees. ‘‘I used the office
for some information,’ said Langh-
eim, who is planning to go to graduate
school.

“I am very pleased with those
seniors who used the services,’’ said
Heatley, ‘‘Most have used not only
training services, but also on-campus
recruitment.’’

This year between 55 to 60 com-
panies have come to W&L for on-
campus recruitment, approximately
20 companies more than last year,
said Heatley.

This growth can be attributed to
several changes in the Placement Of-
fice, said Heatley.

‘*We are assisted in part by alumni
volunteer operations,’’ he said. In
these programs alumni are given the
opportunity to participate in place-
ment. Alumni in banking, accounting
and insurance have come back to
campus to recruit, said Heatley.

Also, a Career Day that is held in
Lynchburg has an ‘impressive di-
versity of options,’’ said Heatley.
Only 20 students attended this year.
Heatley would like to see ‘‘no less
than 150 seniors attend next year.’

‘It’s hard to get a company to come
here,’’ said Heatley. This is largely
due to the size and location of W&L.
However, Heatley said that ‘good
press’’ is attracting more and more
companies.

Standard and Poor, a noted organi-
zation that reviews businesses and
corporations, recently conducted a
survey tracing the education of the
country’s top 50,000 executives (as
labelled by Fortune 500). W&L was
fourth, with 169 executives, behind
Williams College, Amherst and Col-
gate, with 355, 263, and 198 execu-
tives, respectively.

‘*Publicity like that attracts human
resources departments, which decides
what colleges to visit,’’ said Heatley.
This publicity increases the number of
businesses that come on-campus to
interview.

Between 40 to SO seniors have
received offers, said Heatley, and are
‘‘oscillating between the options.”

Senior Joe Zamorano, of Baltimore.
Md., has been interviewing since Sep-
tember. Said Zamorano of the Place-
ment Program, ‘‘They have so many
interviews on-campus. It saves a lot of
time because you don’t have to go off
campus.”’ Zamorano, a_ natural
science/math major, has had 13 inter
views including interviews with
pharmaceutical sales, retail com-
panies, and accounting firms. He has
been called back for a couple of sec-
ond interviews, although he has not
had any offers yet.

Heatley said there are two peaks in
interviewing. Accounting firms,
banks and corporations do most of
their recruiting in October and
November. There is another inter-
viewing peak in January and Febru-
ary, said Heatley, although the
Placement Office learns of people
coming to campus weekly.

“If anyone is out there innocently
thinking ‘I'll start my job search this
summer,’ I strongly urge him to come
in right away,’’ said Heatley. Most
corporations will have organized a
search early in the year in an attempt
to hire the best candidates, said Heat-
ley. He added that ‘‘doors close”
when the summer starts and it be-
comes much more difficult to conduct
a job search.

Senior Greg Knapp, of West Palm
Beach, Fla., said ‘‘I think [the Place-
ment Office] is good if you like bank-
ing. I don’t think I want commercial
banking.’’ He feels that the on-
campus recruiting is convenient,
however. ‘‘I haven’t had time to go
off-campus,’’said Knapp.

Knapp, who has been interviewing
since January, has been called back
for second interviews, as well. ‘‘Mrs.
Henneman was very helpful to me.
She gave me a lot of advice for second
interviews and would remind me of
things I needed to do,”’ said Knapp.

Senior Coalter Pollack, of Virginia
Beach, Va., said, ‘‘Mrs. Henneman is
very positive, very willing to help
you. She instills a positive attitude in
the student about himself, and that’s
important.’’ Pollack is an English
major who is looking for placement in
entry level sales and management.

Knapp’s only reservation with the
Placement Office is ‘‘there’s not too
much counseling going on, and I think
they need more of that,’’ he said.

Senior Rob Jones, of Newport
News, Va., said, ‘‘There wasn’t too
much [Heatley] could do, because |
didn’t know what I wanted to do.’

Jones attended the resume work-
shop, and has his resume on file in the
Placement Office. He said the resume
workshop was really helpful to him
Jones said, ‘‘I’m going to wait until
after I graduate to continue my job
search.”’

Heatley's goal is to actively involve
a larger part of each senior class in the
Career Development and Placement
Office.

‘‘Around here we are a much more
visible office and are involved in all
the campus activities,’’ said Heatley.

Zamorano said he paid attention to
the notices on campus and approved of
the offices sending information to the
fraternity house. Generally, he has

OPINION

 

Poster

The Mock Convention is finally here, after the long wait and
hours of work devoted to preparing the gigantic event. Of course,
those responsible for planning the convention and ensuring its suc-
cess deserve a round of applause, so to speak, for their efforts. It’s a
mammoth job, but one that is well worth the effort.

However, when we look at the memorabilia for the convention,
we think there is a problem. This problem is not nearly big enough
to cast a shadow of ill repute upon the convention, or truly diminish
the outstanding work that has been done so far. Still, it is a problem
that must be addressed.

The 1988 Mock Convention poster features two donkeys driving
a BMW. Of course, we have no problem with this; in fact, it seems
to be quintessential W&L. Unfortunately, in the back seat of the car
there is a tapped keg.

This may seem insignificant at first, until other recent events at
WA&L are considered. For example, when Trident put up posters for
its Winter Slosh party, there was an immediate uproar over the fact
that is featured a jeep with a keg in the back. The poster was quickly
taken down and changed to delete the keg.

Fraternities, which are not allowed to put up posters for parties
anymore, are not allowed to have party themes that stress alcohol.
Because of the drinking age fraternities are now being forced to
move to closed parties, and will most likely eventually be forced
into B.Y.O.B. parties only.

We think it is fairly obvious that alcohol awareness has arrived on
the W&L campus. The university has made an effort to keep stu-
dents informed about alcohol in such ways as the Drug and Alcohol
Awareness Week.

What this means is there is a need for continuity on the W&L
campus. Why should the Mock Convention be allowed to print a
poster featuring two donkeys drinking and driving? Less blatant,
but still questionable is the fact that both the cups and the shirts for
the convention feature donkeys in the act of drinking beer.

We realize that parties are a large part of Mock Convention.
However, we hope that student organizations will soon realize that
it is unfair for some organizations such as fraternities to be re-
stricted in their references to alcohol while other organizations are
not. We believe the Executive Committee should study the problem
and try to find a solution.

Caution

Washington. and Lee students were fortunate-this past weekend-to..
have the opportunity to attend an AIDS symposium sponsored by.»

the university. Two of the nation’s top AIDS researchers gave pre-
sentations containing valuable information for today’s college stu-
dents.

John S. Knox, associate professor of biology at W&L, told a re-
porter that many W&L students do not understand the critical
nature of he AIDS problem. ‘‘Several students dismissed the sub-
ject as not pertinent to them. They did not understand the magnitude
of the problem,‘ he said.

At first it seems hard to believe that students at such a well-known
institution of higher learning would not understand the potential
danger of the AIDS virus to them. However, the conservative stu-
dent body at W&L does seem to be behind the times on the issues
occasionally. But on an issue as large as AIDS the student body
needs to catch up with the times.

It’s not a question of whether or not W&L has a homosexual
community. It’s a question of whether W&L has a sexually active
community. We feel it is safe to say that this university has the lat-
ter. When students understand this, they can begin to understand the
precautions that must be taken.

We applaud the university for the scheduling of the symposium.
We also hope that they will continue to provide information in such
ways to the students. It can only help, and may avoid a serious prob-
lem in the future.

Do journalists have ethics?

 

MY VIEW
By Margaret Pimblett

 

nalism. J

Last weekend, 27 people gathered
in Reid Hall to participate in the Jour-
i Institute, Ten W&L

   
 

 

nalism ethics course were joined by 13
professional journalists from both the
print and broadcast media, plus one
lawyer from Tennessee, two W&L
professors and one W&L administra-
tor.

I remember an old joke. One person
says, ‘I’m reading a book on journal-
ism (business, legal, medical, etc.)
ethics.’’ Second person says, ‘‘Must
be a short book.’’

We spent 21 hours during that
weekend discussing the ethics of jour-
nalism—the mental analysis which

enrolled i the jour-.

should take place during every editor-
ial decision. One notion generally held
among the journalists participating
was that the general public does not
realize or believe that journalists actu-
ally put some thought into what is
printed in the morning paper or seen
on the evening news.

That came as a shock to me. I guess
I expect non-journalists just to under-
stand why the news establishment pu-
blishes photographs of a family whose
son has just died, or why White House
reporters scream questions at Presi-
dent Reagan as he is boarding Air
Force One, or any of a number of
other questions which the members of
the public sometimes express.

The question about yelling at the
president is easy to answer. Thus far,
Ronald Reagan has had fewer press
conferences during his term in office
than either Lyndon Johnson or Ri-
chard Nixon. That worries me, and
should worry plenty of you. Because
the White House reporters are not gi-
ven the opportunity to question the
President in the White House briefing
room during a legitimate news event,
they must find themselves yelling on

the White House lawn while Ronnie
smiles, waves, and cups his ear to
hear the questions(which he’s not
planning to answer) over the roar of
the helicopter.

Now, about photographs of grief-
stricken family members... where is
the news value in publishing them?
Most journalists would say that the
death is a newsworthy event and the
reaction of the family is therefore
newsworthy. Call me a soft-hearted
liberal, but I don’t think that the ex-
pression of grief“#fter the death of a
loved one is terribly newsworthy. The

would be if the
family were laughing and having a
good time after the death of a child.
That would certainly be different than
how we expect people to react; be-
cause it would be unusual, it would be
newsworthy.

Of course, we can move from dis-
cussing photographs of dead people to
examining the interviews of survi-
vors. For example: An Ace Reporter
is talking to the mother of a child and
says, ‘‘Ma’am, your son was just run
over by a Mack truck and squashed
flatter than a pancake. How do you

feel right now?’’

While we’re on the subject of *
worthless questions, how about that ,

ABC Winter Olympics coverage? ‘‘I
have some good news and some bad
news. The good news is that you just
gave a terrific figure skating perfor-
mance. The bad news is that you lost
the gold medal. Reaction??’’ How in
the world could that announcer (I dar-
en’t call him a reporter) ask that ques-
tion? The athlete’s responses was
simple. ‘‘I’m disappointed. What
more can T say?” Exactly.

Yes, there are questions which
should be phrased differeftly, there
are photographs which should be held
from publication, there is video foo-
tage which need not be aired but
which is broadcast anyway because
someone thinks it will impress the au-
dience.

But there are also journalists who
pay attention to the opinions of the
readers and audience and who think
about what they use for the news, in-
stead of simply looking for the most
sensational stories and pictures. We
leave that to the Star and the National
Enquirer.

To the Editors:

I watched, read, and heard the media reports of
the uproar regarding the theme to this year’s
Fancy Dress Ball—with disappointment. If a lib-
eral arts university is supposed to ‘‘open minds,”’
WA&L is failing because the liberal agenda of the
faculty, administration, and certain student
groups is bent on snapping those minds shut—at
least minds that do not swallow the liberal agenda
whole.

Dissent leads to discourse, and discourse to
understanding. Or so the theory goes. Such a con-
dition cannot exist when only one interpretation,
the interpretation of the liberal civil rights move-
ment, is permitted vis-a-vis the theme of this
year’s Ball: ‘‘Reconciliation.”’

The period of reunion and reconstruction be-
tween the Confederate and Union States yielded
the thirteenth amendment (no slavery) and several
civil rights statutes that are vehicles for much liti-
gation even today. Such facts are irrelevant to
strident liberals who have an agenda to promote
and impose.

The original lofty civil rights goal of tearing
down artificial barriers (segregation, voting
rights) has taken on the stink of the sewer today as
it seeks to erect artificial barriers (forced busing,
quotas, set-asides in federal contracts). In the
words of Justice Thurgood Marshall, ‘‘You guys
have been discriminating for years... Now it’s our
turn.”’

The civil rights movement began to express a
moral imperative. Today, the movement is a
racket in which liberal constituency groups strug-
gle to classify themselves as ‘‘victims’’ so as to
get a share of the government largess earmarked
for ‘‘victims.’’ Being a ‘‘victim’’ is profitable, so
it should not surprise anyone that after 30 years of
the civil rights movement the circle of ‘‘victims’’
continues to grow.

The civil rights movement wants to re-write his-
tory, or suppress certain parts of it a la ‘‘The Rec-
onciliation Ball.’’ To many, me included, 1865
was a time of duty and honor, a time of pride and

heritage, a time of rugged individualism and dig-
nity in the face of defeat, and a time of fair ladies
and brave gentlemen, However, the civil rights
movement sees no good in 1865 because there was
some bad, and if anyone disagrees he is a racist.
So there!

‘*McCarthyism’’ is a misnomer for the destruc-
tion of one’s reputation by labeling—without sub-
stantiation—his ideas as antithetical to democratic
thought. The civil rights movement has its sacred
cows (the annual rite of agitating for sanctions
against South Africa, the claims that the death
penalty discriminates against blacks, the bogey-
man of cultural bias in standardized testing), and
if anyone disagrees with the movement’s position
on these and other issues, no ifs, ands, or buts, he
is a racist.

I disagree, and I can almost hear the liberals
moaning now: ‘‘He’s a racist.’’ I am disappointed
in the liberals on the faculty, in the administra-
tion, and in the student body who will not permit
me, and others, to disagree. W&L is failing in its
mission because they (the liberals) are engaging in
the ‘‘McCarthyism’’ of the 1980s.

Very truly yours,
James N.L. Humphreys

FD theme

To the Editors:

I read with much chagrin and dismay the furor
surrounding this year’s Fancy Dress theme—The
Reconstruction.

I was particularly irritated by the views of Miss

More comments on Fancy Dress theme controversy

Thompson, the Minority Student Association
spokesperson. I find her exception to the theme on
the grounds that it was somehow racist patently
absurd.

I fail to see how she could take offense with a
period in history which celebrated the Eman-
cipation of blacks and their subsequent installment
as citizens. Of course they, as history with the
benefit of hindsight shows, continued to be ex-
ploited until 1964.

However, contrast the speed and commitment
with which blacks emerged with the 1865 ‘‘E-
mancipation’’ of the serfs in Russia and the record
clearly demonstrates that the era (Reconstruction)
truly heralded a new beginning for blacks. The
period also recalls, for members of the Washing-
ton and Lee community, a time when the virtues
of chivalry and conduct as a gentleman were more
widely observed, especially in the person of
Robert E. Lee.

Given these two important themes: the emer-
gence of blacks and the age of American chivalry,
I find Miss Thompson views narrow-minded, bi-
goted and devoid of any historical perspective. I
only hope the MSA too benefits from hindsight
and is more prudent in selecting their next presi-
dent.

‘gender

“By Jim Lake
-Staff Reporter

 

 

_ _ the results of last month’s survey of
« nearly 1,000 W&L students should be
savailable by Friday, and a report out-
, lining the responses will be finished a
week later, according to the professor
‘whose class conducted the study.
David R. Novack said his sociology
research methods class has spent the
‘last five weeks entering the responses
,into the university computer system.
He said trial runs have shown only a
"few errors, and those should be cor-
atected by the end of the week.

The survey, which was conducted
‘outside of the Registrar’s Office dur-
,ing registration week, dealt with a var-

iety of topics but focused on gender-
related issues.

+ The survey included two coeduca-
tion questions, asking students how
they felt about the decision to admit
swomen and whether coeducation is in
the best interest of the school.

Because the computer program can
‘measure more than one variable at a
,time, Novack said his class will be

able to see how opinions on coeduca-
*tion vary according to class and sex.
, Novack said his research methods

 

 

issues’

class has conducted surveys in 1982,
1984 and 1986 but said this one is
somewhat different from the other
studies.

“In terms of the number of ques-
tions, it’s only slightly longer,’’ he
said. ‘The real shift is that, instead of
it simply being a questionnaire on
coeducation, we eliminated a number
of the questions that no longer seem to
be relevant.”’

Novack said some of the questions
on the 1986 survey were also included
this time so that the answers of this
year’s juniors and seniors can be
compared to the responses they gave
as freshmen and sophomores.

‘‘Two years ago, for example, it
was the freshman males who were
most opposed to coeducation,”’ be-
cause they felt W&L women were re-
ceiving special treatment, according
to Novack. He said his class is looking
forward to see if those men feel the
same way now.

Other questions examined the atti-
tudes students have about women in
society, careers, marriage and chil-
dren.

The study also dealt with student
body elections, the social lives of
W&L students, student satisfaction,
the amount of control the administra-
tion has in students’ lives and Trident.

to leave
next week

By Laura Dodge
Staff Reporter

 

 

At the end of March W&L’s Direc-
tor of Communications, Jeff Hanna
will leave his position in the univer-
sity’s Publications Office. Hanna has
accepted the title of director of college
relations at the College of Wooster in
Wooster, Ohio.

Hanna said he has been at W&L for
the past seven years. At first he wor-
ked in the News Office, and now as
director of four departments under the
heading ‘‘communications.”’

His responsibilities include the uni-
versity’s publications, news office,
sports information, and the print shop,
said Hanna.

Because of his office location and
nature of his position, he and his staff
of three spend most of their time with
publications.

The staff performs many tasks, in-
cluding the Alumni Magazine pub-
lished six times a year, W&L’s cata-
logues, admissions booklets, and all
Summer Program pieces.

Hanna says he will miss the staff in
the publications department.

‘The thing I’ll miss most about my
job is the people who work with me.
They’ re exceptional at what they do.”’

He thinks ‘‘we’ve made great
strides in our publications.”

Such improvements include an im-
proved Alumni Magazine, with signi-
ficant and varied articles, and a rede-
signed, color cover.

  

Jeff Hanna

The publications office recently
won the Grand Award for the Admis-
sions Office’s View Book, which de-
scribes the university. Hanna says the
View Book will be entered in a
national competition.

Hanna says he decided last Febru-
ary to move to Wooster for ‘‘the time
[with family], a new challenge, and
different problems to solve.’’

Wooster College is closer to his
home state of West Virginia, and his
alma mater—Oberlin.

Hanna says he visited Wooster and
‘‘liked the community.”

Along with his job as director of
college relations, Hanna believes he
“thas things to offer them in the way of
admissions. Different looks, different
ideas. I’ll see things in a new way.”’

As with anything new, Hanna says
he feels a ‘‘little scared,’’ yet excited
because the job presents ‘‘a chal-
lenge.”

At the same time, Hanna says W&L
will be a “‘hard place to leave. We'll
miss a lot of things about Lexington.”’

" Ethics seminar

discusses ‘sleaze’

 

By Eleanor Nelson
Staff Reporter

 

When reading the daily strip of
Bloom County, or Doonesbury, or any
satirical cartoon, how often do you
question the intentions of the artist,
the implications of the cartoon, or the
reactions of the readers?

Journalists must make decisions
daily concerning the nature and impli-
cations of stories they write and pu-
blish. This past weekend W&L stu-
dents met with professional journalists
for a seminar entitled, ‘‘Institute On
The Ethics Of Journalism’’. The three
day seminar featured journalists from
all over the country who are active in
many aspects of media.

Friday evening Edward P. Bassett
gave the keynote lecture entitled,
‘This Side of Sleaze, the Line that
Wavers.”’

Bassett, a 1951 graduate of W&L,
addressed the concerns raised by the
Supreme Court case ruling of Jerry
Falwell versus Larry Flint.

The cartoon in question depicted
Falwell in an offensive manner. Chief
Justice William Renquist’s ruling
stated the cartoon in no way purported
to be factual, and there was no reck-
less disregard for the truth.

This ruling gave greater freedom to
satirical cartoonists and journalists.

Bassett concluded his speech with a

challenge to journalists to handle their
freedom and power with responsibi-
lity, distinguishing the appropriate
from the inappropriate.

Saturday and Sunday the students,
faculty, and professionals discussed
how to cover, with responsibility and
a sense of ethics, current issues facing
the media.

The participants also attended a lec-
ture Saturday morning entitled, ‘*Pu-
blic Health Policy on AIDS.”’

For the rest of Saturday and Sunday
the guest speakers prompted discus-
sion with their views of current ethics
in journalism and presented actual
cases and stories they found con-
troversial.

All the students involved are enrol-
led in Professor Ron MacDonald and
Professor Louis Hodges’ class of Eth-
ics in Journalism.

Faculty and students involved in the
weekend’s seminar felt it had been
very interesting and successful.

Junior Maguerite Ayers said, ‘‘It
was a great chance to rub elbows with
some heavy-hitting journalists and get
to know them as people.”’

The seminar drew journalists from
WDBJ-TV, The Roanoke Times &
World News, The Richmond News
Leader and Times Dispatch, and such
leaders in the profession as the chair-
man for the Society of Professional
Journalists, and the Executive Man-
ager of the Virginia Press Associa-
tion.

‘L.A. Law’ cited in
applications rise

 

From Staff Reports

 

Applications to the W&L School of
Law are up 25 percent over last year,
according to Susan Palmer, associate
dean of the law school, and part of the
reason for the increase is the popular-
ity of the L. A. Law television program
and the broadcasting of the Iran-
Contra hearings this summer.

Palmer said the law school has
received 1,200 applications for 120
spots in the law class of 1991. Last
year the law school received approxi-
mately 1,000 applications for the same
number of spots.

*‘Anytime lawyers are in the news,
such as with the Iran-Contra hearings
and L.A. Law, there is an increase in
interest in the law,’’ Palmer said. ‘‘It
is much like the increase in journalism
during Watergate in the seventies.”’

Palmer said the increase in applica-
tions to the W&L law school can also
be linked to the stock market crash last
fall and the general decline in the
business community.

““We are seeing lots of applications
from_ stockbrokers, portfolio man-
agers, and other business-related gra-
duates with M.B.A.s,’’ Palmer said.
**Investment banking has been a popu-
lar career choice for several years, but
it doesn’t seem to be as popular this
year as it has been in the past.’’

Palmer said many of the students
applying to the W&L law school this

year are older and have been out in the
business world for three or four years.

“‘We have more graduate degrees
and more career changers in this ap-
plicant pool than we have had in the
past,’’ she said. ‘“We have certified
public accountants, real estate
brokers, physicians, health care
professionals, and even-an abstract ar-
tist.”’

Some of these career changers,
Palmer said, are exploring ways to re-
late their former professions to the
law. For example, Palmer noted, the
physicians are interested in the law
from the perspective of malpractice
insurance and defending physicians
who are sued for malpractice. The ab-
stract artist is interested iti copyright-
ing laws and representing other ar-
tists.

The increase in applications at
W&L reflects a national trend. Ac-
cording to the Law School Admissions
Council, applications to law schools
across the country are expected to
number 75,000 to 80,000, an increase
of 17 percent. The number of appli-
cants to law schools peaked in the
mid-1970s at an estimated 85,000.

Palmer warns, however, that those
students who apply to law schools be-
cause of L.A. Law or the Iran-Contra
hearings may not understand what a
career in law means in the real world.

“The gulf between perception and
reality for most first year law students
is wide anyway,’’ Palmer said. ‘‘The
gulf between L.A. Law and reality is
even wider.”’

who have encountered frustrations
in their job search are invited to at-
tend.

Suicide in B-Flat will be directed
by W&L junior Delia Ford. Sui-
cide in B-Flat, set in the world of
American jazz, centers around the
investigation of two detectives into
the apparent-ewicide of a renowned
jazz musician. Shepard’s charac-
ters, more animations of itteas than
actual people, create this play’s
unique portrayal of an artist's pur-
suit of identity and creative free-
dom and the struggles which result
from this search.

The second play, The Frog
Prince by David Mamet will be
directed by W&L junior Monica
Burke. The Frog Price is an up- |
dated version of the fairy tale about |
a prince’s transformation into a |
frog and subsequent efforts to get a |
pure and honest woman to kiss him |

|
|

 

and return him to his former state.
Mamet’s adaptation of the play,
with its contemporary language,
transforms the medieval tale into a
modern comedy of love and loy-
alty.

Seven swimmers earn all-American

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

The W&L men’s swimming team
capped off its sparkling season with an
impressive | |th-place finish out of 69
teams in the NCAA Division III
championships last weekend in At-
lanta.

The Generals had seven swimmers
earn all-American or honorable men-
tion all-America honors in nine
events. The top eight finishers in each
event are all-Americans, while the 9th
through 16th spots earn honorable
mention all-America recognition.

“It was a team effort that got us to

11th,’’ said head coach Page Remil
lard, whose team completed its best
championship meet in six years. ‘*Our
goal last year was to be in the ‘sweet
16.’ It’s March Madness, it’s basket-
ball time so we try to identify our team
goals so that people understand what
our goals are.”’

Sophomore David Olson’ was
W&L’s top performer, earning all-
America status in seven events and
breaking three school records. He was
narrowly defeated in the 100- and
200-yard backstrokes, taking second
place in school record times in both
backstroke events. Olson also finished
fifth in the 200-yard individial medley
with a school record 1:55.49.

Lady netters take
two 9-0 matches

 

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

 

The W&L women’s tennis team
gained complete 9-0 victories at home
against Bridgewater on Tuesday and
Roanoke yesterday. Since these two
opponents are in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference, the Generals’
success balanced out a tough 9-0 loss
to Wellesley on Monday afternoon.
Wellesley beat W&L with a consider-
ably deeper and more experienced
team.

In the Bridgewater and Roanoke
matches, W&L swept through the sin-
gles matches. Scoring victories for the
Generals was freshman Jean Stroman,
who won at No. | singles, followed by
freshmen Kelly Martone and Kathy
Leake at No. 2 and No. 3 respec-
tively. Sophomore Teresa Southard
was back playing and winning at No.
4 with freshman Shawn Wert at No. 5
and junior Benny Savage at No. 6.

The doubles teams of Stro-
man/Leake, Martone/Wert and soph-
omore Lara Eggers and junior Martha
Christian also took their matches.

The players will readily admit that
they expected to defeat Bridgewater,
although head coach William Wash-

burn is hesitant to speak in terms of
‘‘anticipated victories’ and prefers to
commend his team on its strong per-
formance Tuesday.

Martone and sophomore Meredith
Attwell both found it difficult to assess
the match against Roanoke since both
teams viewed the Maroons as not
having one of their best days. Wash-
burn considered Roanoke to be more
of a challenge than predicted, and
called their team, ‘‘formidable.’’ But
other W&L players are consistent in
the opinion that Roanoke was not as
strong as the teams played so far, and
that the toughest opponents are yet to
come.

‘Emory and Henry will be a chal-
lenge,’’ said Attwell, ‘‘but we’ll see
what happens after spring break.”’

Attwell was referring to the team’s
training in Hilton Head during the up-
coming vacation, during which the
Generals will play several matches
against other teams.

Washburn was praiseworthy of the
team as a whole. ‘‘I feel that we are
beginning to pull together as a unit,”’
he said.

W&L’s next matches are tomorrow,
away at Randolph-Macon Women’s
College, and at home Monday against
Sweet Briar.

The Generals’ 200-yard medley re
lay team, consisting of Olson, sopho-
more Shawn Copeland and juniors
Moose Herring and Jeff Bercaw,
grabbed 8th place with a time of
1:37.34 to earn all-America awards.
The 400-yard medley relay team, con-
sisting of Olson, Copeland, Bercaw
and juniors David Reavy and David
Dietz, also were all-Americans, end-
ing up 6th with a school record
3:31.57. Dietz swam the freestyle an-
chor in the morning preliminaries but
Remillard changed to Reavy for the
finals, which. explains why five
swimmers garnered all-America hon-
ors.

Dietz’s position, to use it as an exam-

lay to the bigs. It put your relay in a

brought us home, so all five get rec-

Bercaw received honorable mention

American swim of his own, taking

Offense, defense go sour in lacrosse loss

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

Taking 89 shots but scoring on only
seven of them, the W&L lacrosse
team lost at home to Gettysburg 10-7
Saturday but will try to rebound Sat-
urday against Bowdoin.

The loss to Gettysburg marked the
second-consecutive game in which
W&L, 2-3, scored on less than one-
fifth of its shots. The 8 percent per-
formance Saturday followed 19 per-
cent shooting (9 of 47) against Lynch-
burg College on March 16.

“I don’t fault effort, and I don’t
fault choices of shots,’’ said head
coach Dennis Daly. ‘‘We just have got
to become more efficient.

‘‘We had some people that were
0-for-15 who are primary shooters for
us, and I was very surprised that, with
that number of shots, and with the
shots they were getting, they could not
score,’’ he said. ‘‘We are not making
the most of those opportunities.’’

Even with what may be a school-
record number of shots, Daly said
W&L’s inside shooting game was not
strong enough.

‘‘They obviously collapsed their
zone so that we could not get the in-
side shot as frequently as we would
have liked,’’ said Daly, who admitted
that, even when his team did get inside
chances, ‘*We blew them.”’

Things were not any better for

Two wrestlers
are Academic

all-Americans

 

From Staff Reports

 

For the fifth consecutive year W&L
has had representatives on the NCAA
Wrestling Coaches Association Aca-

. demic all-America team.

This year senior Steve Castle and
sophomore Lee Garlove were selec-
ted.

Castle, a chemistry major from
New Canaan, Ct., is a repeater from
last year’s Academic all-American
team. He had a 21-6-1 record wres-
tling at 118 and 126 Ibs. this year.

Garlove, a history major from Lou-
isville, Ky., had a 17-7-1 record at
142 Ibs.

‘‘T am extremely proud of both of
them,"’ said head coach Gary Franke,
‘They are outstanding people in the
classroom and on the wrestling matt."’

W&L on the defensiveehtl:’**Gettys-
burg took 27 shots, and we allowed 10
to score. That’s a concern,”’ he said.
“‘T thought we played pretty poorly
defensively.”’

Going into the game, Daly said he
was most concerned about Gettysburg
attackers Earl Kight and Orin Levine,
who scored 10 points against W&L
last year.

And the Generals handled those two
players pretty well Saturday, shutting
out Levine and allowing Kight only
one assist.

But six other Bullets did the damage
instead, with attackman Keith Flem-
ing and midfielder Robert Bruns each
recording three goals and one assist.

‘‘Any time we give up 10 goals on
27 shots, we’re not playing good de-
fense,’’ concluded Daly.

The game went back and forth
throughout the first half. W&L led 3-1
in the first quarter and 5-3 in the sec-
ond before the Bullets scored four

lead.

Despite dominating time of posses-
sion in the second half, the Generals
scored only twice in the last two
periods, on third-quarter goals by
senior midfielder Sandy Harrison and
sophomore attacker Chris Giblin. The
Bullets scored twice in the third quar-
ter and once in the fourth to lock up
the win.

Giblin led all scorers with five
points (2 goals, 3 assists). Senior mid-
fielder Robbie Stanton made two as-
sists but was shut out in 17 shots on
goal. Harrison, sophomore midfielder +
Chris Mastrogivanni, junior attack-
man John Ware and junior midfielders
Joe Caccamo and Stuart Geisel each
scored once for W&L.

For Gettysburg, goalie Brian Sulli-
van made 23 saves.

Men score
Millersville,

By Stuart Sheldon
Staff Reporter

 

 

The W&L men’s tennis team im-
proved its record to 7-3 in action this
week.

The Generals defeated Millersville
last Thursday 8-1. The victory was led
by junior Bobby Matthews, playing in
the No. | singles position for W&L,
who defeated nationally-ranked Oliver
Merrill of Millersville in straight sets,
6-2, 6-4. Merrill is a Division II all-
America doubles player as well.

W&L’s only loss came at the No. 2
position, where junior Robert Haley
lost for the second straight time. Mil-
lersville’s Mike Kennedy handled
Haley in straight sets, 6-4, 6-3.

On Saturday the Generals played
host to a tough D-I competitor, Vir-
ginia Tech. The Hokies were in the
hunt after the singles competition,
trailing 4-2, but the Generals closed
them out in doubles to seal the victory.

Haley moved up to the top position
again and beat Marc Bernstine 6-3,
6-1. Matthews, back at No. 2 for
W&L, downed Phil Payne 6-2, 6-0.
No. 3 seed senior David McLeod had
to go to extra games in each of two
sets to defeat Tech’s Ed Butterworth
7-5, 7-6. McLeod won the second set
on the first tie-break point.

Freshman John Morris, W&L’s No.
4 singles player, suffered his first sin-
gles loss of the season at the hands of
Brian Hogge, 6-1, 6-2. Morris’ sin-
gles record now stands at an impres-
sive 15-1.

Senior Chris Wiman, No. 5 for the
Generals this week, needed three sets,
including a tie-breaker in the second,
to beat Paul Calhoun 5-7, 7-6 (1), 6-4.
W&L’s No. 6 man, freshman Bill
Meadows, lost to Bruce Reistle 6-3,
6-3.

In doubles, the No. 1 W&L team of
Matthews and McLeod quickly put
away Tech’s top pair 6-0, 7-5. This
win gave the Generals five points in
the contest, clinching the win.
However, the other two doubles mat-
ches were far from over.

Although head coach Gary Franke
did not view the win over Tech as an
upset, he felt that ‘it was a good win
to get [against a solid Division I
team].”’

As soon as the Virginia Tech match
was over, the Generals climbed into a
W&L van for a night drive to David-
son College in North Carolina, where

W&L had a Sunday afternoon mat-
chup against the D-I power.

The Generals were mildly sur-
prised, to say the least, to learn that
the matches would be played on Da-
vidson’s clay courts, not the standard
all-weather surface ones. ‘‘It’s no ex-
cuse though,”’ said Franke on the sud-
den site change, ‘‘they were better
players.”’

The Generals were put out of the
running in the singles competition as
only Morris could pull out a win on
the slow courts.

Haley, at No. 1 for the Generals,
lost to Jim Thompson 6- 2, 6-3. Matt-
hews fell to Bill Young, a high-school
acquaintance of his, with a similar
score. McLeod lost to Sebastian Koch
6- 4, 6-4.

Morris improved his singles record
to 16-1 with a win over Davidson's
Carlos Ortega 6-3, 6-2, while Wiman
lost to Tim Haywood in three sets,
6-3, 0-6, 6-2. Meadows then bowed
out to Davidson’s Kurtis Zabell in
straight sets, 6-3, 7-5.

Bitter cold, snowy weather on
Monday morning led to the cancela-
tion of W&L’s home match against
Lynchburg College that day. Franke
called the game at | p.m., and said
there were no plans made for making
up the contest.

The final game for the Generals this
“week was on Tuésday against the Uni-
versity of North Carolina at Greens-
boro. W&L had no problem handling
the visiting team, sweeping the match
9-0.

The Generals travel to Swarthmore
College in Pennsylvania this weekend,
where they will play two important
matches. On Saturday W&L will face
Swarthmore College, ranked No. 6 in
the D-III polls.

‘*This match will allow us to com-
pare ourselves to common oppo-
nents.’’ said Franke. Earlier in the
season, Swarthmore traveled to the
West coast, where they lost to No. 3
Santa Cruz 5-4, and No. 12 Redlands
9-0. The East coast team did manage
one win, defeating No. 5 Clairmont-
Mudd-Scripts 5-4.

Washington College, another strong
D-III program, is currently ranked
No. 2 in the polls Both matches
should be very close.

The Generals will return home to
play the Virginia Military Institute on
Tuesday at 3 p.m. on the upper courts.

W&L nine caught in three-game tailspin

 

By Gary McCullough
Staff Reporter

 

The W&L baseball team is in its
most active part of the season right
now, but the postponed game against
Maryville on Monday gave them a
little bit of a breather.

A week ago, the Generals picked up
their first Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference win with a 11-3 victory over
Eastern Mennonite. W&L had 15 hits
with junior catcher Eddie Klank lead-
ing the way with four. Senior Eric
Acra went six innings for the pitching
win.

Last Saturday was a double-header
at home with Randolph- Macon. In the ,
opener, first-year law student Hugh
Finkelstein took the first pitch of the
day and deposited it over the fence to
give the Generals a 1-0 lead. Finkel-

stuin’s homer and five more W&L
runs weren’t enough, however, as the
hard-hitting Macon team (it had 26
hits in the two games combined) put
up 14 runs on the board to win the first
game 14-6.

Senior Carter Steuart started for the
Generals on the mound and juniors
Mike Temple and Dave Holland came
in for relief. In the second game, jun-
ior Chris Cunningham led off on the
hill for W&L with sophomores David
Smith and Sean Connelly coming in
for relief.

Junior Tom Skeen was 2 for 3 in the
second game, including a home run.
However, Macon was able to keep the
runs coming across the plate and fin-
ished off the Generals 13-4.

On Tuesday, the Generals played
host to the Hampden-Sydney Tigers
on Smith Field, and, although the
score was closer, the result was still

the same.

Hampden-Sydney got on top with
an early 3-0 lead. Then the Generals
were able score twice late in the game,
but the Tigers answered the W&L
comeback bid with two runs of their
own. In the bottom of the ninth, W&L
had runners on second and third with
two outs, but were unable to capi-
talize, leaving both stranded. Final
score: Hampden-Sydney 5, W&L 2.

The Tigers had 12 hits and 10 walks
that led to many base runners. Head
coach Jeff Stickley, whose team’s re-
cord stands at 4-4 overall (1-5 in the
ODAC), said that when you have that
many opportunities, it only takes a
few key hits to score a lot of runs.

tinues this afternoon with Lynchburg

double-header on Saturday.

Golf continues to find scoring ‘tough’

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

For the second-consecutive week,
the W&L golf team failed to break the
top 20 in multi-team invitational.

The Generals took 21st place out of
24 teams in the Max Ward Intercolle-
giate Invitational in North Carolina on
Monday and Tuesday. W&L was tied
for 20th after the first round of play
was completed.

Unlike the previous week’s perfor-
mance, head coach Buck Leslie did
not have high expectations for his
team.

‘We knew before we went down
there that this was a tough tournament

on a tough golf course,’’ he said. ‘*We
hadn’t been down there in a couple of
years because it was so hard on the
players’ scoring averages. "’

Senior John Gammage led all W&L
players with a two-day total of 171,
He received help from junior Tom
Wingfield and senior Gary Campbell,
who shot 176 and 179 respectively.

Leslie hoped that, although the
scores were high, his team picked up
some valuable playing experience

‘*You should benefit from tough
competition,”’ he said. ‘‘We went
down there to get some competition
rounds under our belts and, hopefully,
it was a learning situation.”’

All the players at the invitational

had to play under adverse condition.
Competing on a long, Bermuda grass
course without a practice round, many
players found the going tough on the
fairways.

After the first round of play, only
10 of the over 100 golfers managed to
break 80.

W&L will play today against Shen-
andoah and then tomorrow in an Old
Dominion Athletic Conference round
robin, both matches being held on the
General's home course at the Lexing-
ton Country Club. In the ODAC
round robin, the Generals will com-
pete against Bridgewater, Hampden-
Sydney and Randolph-Macon.

It seems that Director James L
Brooks has done it again. For the first
time since his Terms of Endearment
came out in 1983, a film has been
released that completely encapsulates
the emotion and the sensitivity of love
and relationships while putting it in a
microcosmic view of society that
everyone can relate to.

Broadcast News has been heralded
since its release as the film to beat at
this year’s Golden Globe and Acad-
emy Awards. After seeing the film,
you will understand why.

Once again James Brooks has suc-
cessfully shown everyone what it
takes to achieve cinematic excellence.
Cinematic excellence is not about
excellent film; its about the cinemato-
graphy, the story, the actors and ac-
tresses, the construction of the film,
and the obvious care that goes into get-
ting each detail precisely the way the
director conceptualized it.

Brooks started with a concept of
caring, of love and of emotion and de-
veloped it into a story of three people
who love each other, and who hate
each other. They can’t live with or
without each other. It’s the perfect
friendship which is where the absolute
beauty of Brooks’ direction comes in.
Most directors do not know when to
stop. They don’t understand when
enough is enough. Broadcast News
doesn’t go too far; it’s just right.

While Brooks direction is wonder-
ful, he is only as good as his actors
make him appear. With William Hurt,
Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks, how
can he possibly look bad?

William Hurt’s performance as the
dashing anchorman in Broadcast
News rivals his Oscar-winning per-
formance as the transvestite in Kiss of
the Spider Woman as the finest of his
career. His insecure, yet commanding
Tom Grunick seems to have a genuine
realness about it that makes you won-
der if Hurt is acting at all. There is a

reserve in his character like a spring
that’s ready to jump, yet there is a fire
about him that puts a spark in every si-
tuation he encounters; especially those
involving Holly Hunter.

As good as Holly Hunter was as the
baby-napping Edwina in last year’s
Raising Arizona, that performance
can't touch the Jane Craig she has de-
veloped for Broadcast News. Though
only in her second major film, Hunter
seems to have a real command over
the emotions, faces, gestures and de-
tails it takes to be an Oscar-caliber ac-
tress. In Broadcast News she is con-
stantly on the edge, but like the rest of
the film, never passes out of the para-
meters of the realistic. Holly Hunter is
more wonderful than expected and
were it not for one other actor, would
be the most delightful surprise of the
film.

If James Brooks had looked his en-
tire life for someone to play the role of
Aaron in Broadcast News he couldn’t
have found anyone more perfect than
Albert Brooks. Aaron is a character
who doesn’t know who he is, where
he is going, or what he wants; but he’s
trying. He’s in love with Jane but he
doesn’t want her to know; not really
anyway. Albert Brooks is simply per-
fect in the part. His sensitivity gives
the part an authenticity that again
keeps the film from going overboard
or becoming a sappy, cliche commen-
tary on unfulfilled love. Instead,
Broadcast News draws on the hopes,
desires, and expectations of the au-
dience’s feelings of what could be.

In 1983, Terms of Endearment wal-
ked away from the Academy Awards
with five major Oscars including Best
Picture, Best Director, Best Actress
(Shirley MacLaine), Best Supporting
Actor (Jack Nicholson) and Best
Screenplay. If the Academy listens to
this year’s critics, Brooks may pull off
a repeat performance.

Broadcast News, has been Brooks’
obsession for the last six years and it
shows. The film has been nominated
for Best Actor, Best Actress, Best
Supporting Actor, Best Screenplay
and Best Picture and could very well
win them all.

Holly Hunter wins it will be quite a
triumph for her.

Last year my ‘“‘If there’s a God,
He'll Win’’ pick was for Chris
Menges to win the Best Cinematogra-
phy award for his filming of The Mis-
sion which he won. This year, it’s Al-
bert Brooks for Best Supporting
Actor. You can bet the house on this
one. Albert Brooks will win the Best
Supporting Actor award at this year’s
Academy Awards. No question.

As for Best Picture, again it will be
close. Traditionally, if the Academy
can, it tends to give the Oscar to a his-
torical film such as Gandhi or Char-
iots of Fire. With Bernardo Bertoluc-
ci’s film The Last Emperio in the run-
close.
Nevertheless, Broadcast News will be
there and could very well win.

Unbelievably Brooks failed to get a
direction nomination as did any Amer-
ican director for the first time in the
history of the Academy Awards. Em-
pire of the Sun was nominated for all
kinds of awards but as has been the
sad tradition at the Oscars, Steven
Spielberg did not get a direction
nomination. Brooks has a good shot to
bring home the Screenplay award but
he’ll have to get by perennial Screen-
play favorite Woody Allen first.

Regardless of the way the Oscars
turn out, Broadcast News is a must for
you to see. This is one of the three
best films of the year. Don’t miss it;
especially since its finally here.
