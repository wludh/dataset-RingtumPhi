Blue Ridge forum draws recruiters from 30 law schools

 

By David Emrich
Co-editor

 

More than one-hundred students
took advantage of the Blue Ridge
Pre-Law Forum held Monday in the
University Center, said Richard
Heatley, director of the Career
Development and Placement Office.

From 1 p.m. until 4 p.m. admis-

 

sions officers from the thirty schools
were divided alphabetically into
three rooms, with students free to
visit any or all of the rooms. The
forum was open to students from
most of the area colleges, said
Heatley.

At 4 p.m., there was a panel discus-
sion by three of the admissions of-
ficers. The three topics addressed in
the discussion were choosing the cor-
rect law school for oneself, admis-

sions procedures and the meaning
and importance of the LSAT and
grades in the admissions process,
said Heatley.

The day is designed to ‘‘provide a
convenient gathering on this campus
of a number of law schools which
students could approach and ask
their questions concerning applica-
tion to those schools,” said Heatley.

The panel discussion has a slightly
different purpose, according to
Heatley. He said that was intended to

In a recent edition of U.S. News &
World Report, W&L was ranked 25th
nationally among liberal arts col-
leges.

This rating was based on the
response of presidents of colleges all
over the United States. Of 125
presidents surveyed, 92 responded by
naming (in their opinion) the top 10
national liberal arts colleges.

With Thanksgiving approaching
rapidly, the service fraternity Alpha
Phi Omega seeks to increase
awareness of,and raise money for,

‘world hunger.

The pledges of APO are working
with an organization called OxFam
America. The OxFam organization,
according to APO pledge president
Dan Bettendorf is ‘‘a charity service
that provides funds for self-help pro-

give “a sweeping overview [by so-
meone other than himself] of how one
goes about settling on a law school,
making application to that school,
and what one’s chances of admission
would be.”’

Putting together the forum, said
Heatley, involved writing letters to
most of the major law schools in the
country and inviting them to attend.
He said that Monday’s forum
represented the largest turnout
they’ve ever had.

In 1985, W&L received an
honorable mention in the same rank-
ing. Two years previously, W&L was
ranked the number one small liberal
arts college east of the Mississippi.

According to John Elrod, Dean of
the College, “I’d rather be 25th na-
tionally than number one of small
colleges.

“We're competing with the best
liberal arts colleges in the nation,
and that’s where we belong. We're in
very good company and whenever
you’re positively associated with
good colleges it reassociates the no-

grams in under-developed countries.
It is not emergency relief.’’

The program involves all aspects
of the Lexington community.

First, members of APO will ask
students to sign their name to a list
which means that those students will
not eat in the dining hall on the even-
ing of Dec. 3.

For every meal that students
pledge not to eat, the dining hall will
give the money for that meal to the
OxFam organization.

According to Bettendorf, APO is
also trying to get the fraternities and

Heatley said he was very happy
with the forum, but added he wants to
expand the forum to include even
more schools next year.

Heatley also said he talked to the
representatives from the University
of Georgia, Duke, and Washington
and Lee law schools and they told
him they felt the day was profitable.

For the convenience of the
recruiters, Monday’s forum was
organized in conjunction with similar
forums at other schools in Virginia,

tion that we are one of the top col-
leges in the United States.”’

W&L should be considered one of
the top ten liberal arts colleges in the
nation, according to 7.6 percent of all
the presidents who responded.

Yet when comparing SAT scores,
nine of the schools in W&L’s catagory
had average scores of the same or
lower than those of W&L. Twenty
schools had a higher admittance rate
than W&L (29 percent).

“TI don’t want to over estimate
SAT’s because there are also many
also many other important factors in

other community organizations in-
volved.

“Weare hoping. that the frater-
nities show the same enthusiasm for
OxFam as they do for other fund-
raising activities.”’

He further added, “The program is
not limited to the campus. We are in-
volving community churches and
other Lexington organizations in
hopes to make it a community wide
effort.”’

Bettendorf has little idea how
much money the project will bring to
OxFam. When asked about potential
goals, he said, ‘‘The money itself is

according to Heatley.

“For example, [on Wednesday the
recruiters were] at William and
Mary, so they were able to put these
back to back and make a very good
sweep of Virginia schools,” said
Heatley.

According to Heatley, next year’s
forum in scheduled in exactly the
same manner. It will be heldon Mon-
day, Nov. 7, 1988, with William and
Mary’s forum on the following
Wednesday.

W&L reappears in survey;
ranked 25th nationally

the admissions process,’’ stated
Elrod, ‘‘but pay attention to the fact
that we have much higher SAT
scores and a lower admittance rate
than many schools ranked above us.

“Our quality of education is actually
much better than it is perceived to
be. We are experiencing an increase
in student quality and it will take a
while for W&L’s perceptions to catch
up with actuality.

‘“We are providing our students with

a good solid liberal arts education
which is the best preparation for a
career— that’s our strength.”

Alpha Phi Omega sponsors fast for hungry

secondary. It is difficult to assess
how much money we can really
raise, being the first year of Ox-
Fam.”

‘‘What is so often misunderstood,”’
he added, ‘‘is the idea that we are
simply trying to accrue funds to fight
world hunger. That is true, but more
importantly we are trying to bring
awareness of world hunger into this
community.”

The date for the OxFam project is
Dec. 3, and should any groups or
organizations wish to become involv-
ed, they can call Bettendorf at
463-2395.

W&L actors and musicians to have new Pettit, arts center

 

By J.C. Reynolds
Staff Reporter

 

As a liberal arts college, W&L has
done without an adequate perform-
ing area for drama and choral pro-
ductions for way too long, according
to school officials.

In order to accommodate the needs
of the university, W&L will build a
Performing Arts Center to house the
drama department, which will also
provide a performing area for
musical events, said officials.

“The primary purpose of the
building is to be a teaching theater,”
said Frank Parsons, executive assis-
tant to the president.

Parsons said that W&L has
outgrown the Troubadour Theater,
and a larger performing area was
necessary.

The new center will cost an
estimated $9 million, and construc-
tion is scheduled to begin in the spr-
ing of 1988, said Farris Hotchkiss,
vice-president of university relations
and secretary of the board of
trustees,

“This is the university’s longest un-
met need. We have known that we
needed a theater for as long as we
have needed major improvement,”’
said Hotchkiss.

Albert Gordon, professor of fine
arts, agreed that the new center has
been long overdue, but is very ex-
cited about it all.

“T just wish they would hurry up,”
he said.

A general concern among W&L of-
ficials is that students believe the
center is being built only for the
drama department and they want to
let students know that is not the case.

Parsons and Gordon agree that the
center will not only meet the needs of
the drama department, but will
enrich Rockbridge County as well as
benefit the entire W&L community.

“T hope the people on the campus
realize it is something the whole
campus needs and it is not just for
us,” said Gordon.

Hotchkiss said the fund-raising ef-
forts are going well and he has high
hopes of beginning construction in
the spring.

“But in fundraising, you are never
sure of what you can or cannot do,”’
he added.

He said over a period of 1' years
approximately $4 million of the total
project cost of $9 million has been
pledged.

Hotchkiss believes the recent stock
market crash scared people, but it
has not directly effected the cam-
paign.

The 425-seat facility will be located
diagonally across from Gaines
Residence Hall off of Nelson Street.

The Troubadour Theater and the
Boiler Room Theater, both located
off of Main Street, were not very
comfortable and people stayed away,
said Parsons.

“The audience is important, par-
ticularly in a liberal arts college. It is
important for students who will not
get on stage to hear good music or
see good drama,”’ said Hotchkiss.

Parsons said on top of the comfor-
table seating, ‘‘people will enjoy the
theater because the drama depart-
ment puts on high-quality perfor-
mances and the way they cope with
the limitations is outstanding.”’

The stage will have a shock absorb-
ing floor, specially designed for
dance. The orchestra pit will be able
to house an ensemble equal to a
Broadway musical, while the stage
itself will be able to hold a 92-piece
orchestra, large choral groups and
dance companies, said officials.

Gordon said the center is going to
be very attractive and intimate. He
has a special interest in the size
because he helped design the inside.

“Oh God, I can’t wait,’’ he said.

Gordon has already contacted
agents to bring in ballets, touring
companies and the like.

“Neither the campus nor the town
has a nice performing theater, so we
were not able to bring in anything,”
said Gordon.

“It’s going to be a real gem for the
campus,”’ he said.

Lexington agents help with Thanksgiving and Christmas travel arrangements

 

By Abb Jones
Staff Reporter

 

Lexington area travel agencies are
gearing up for the upcoming holidays
as Washington and Lee University

undergraduates and law students
begin making plans to visit family
and friends for the Thanksgiving and

Christmas holidays

Hannelore Roscher, manager of
Herring Travel Agency, said 30 per-
cent of the agency's business is from
W&L students, with the majority of

that being from law students. Betty
Collins, owner of Travel Unlimited on
Washington Street, said W&L
students result in only 5-10 percent of
its business.

Both agencies were quick to point
out that travel agencies work harder
than airlines to get the customer bet-
ter fares, are more likely to help
customers when complications arise
and are more convenient.

‘Well, now days there are so many
options and restrictions that exist,
travel agents can save a lot of com-
plications for travellers,” said
Roscher.

‘We can access all the airlines and
their fares. When you call Piedmont,
Delta or Eastern they'll give you
their fares, whereas we can give you
all the fares,’’ added Collins.

Collins said that much of the
general public is under the false im-
pression that customers pay travel
agencies for their services, when ac-
tually the agencies get paid a 10 per-
cent commission directly from the
airlines, hotels, rental car agencies
and cruise ships for which they make
sales.

“Another advantage [of using

Travel Unlimited] is that you get
$100,000 in flight insurance as a bonus
for every airline ticket you pur-
chase,”’ Collins added.

While W&L students are for the
most part going home for Thanksgiv-
ing and Christmas, winter and spring
breaks offer prime opportunities for
travel agencies to send students
snow-skiing in the mountains or to
the beach during the spring.

Collins said most students opt for
winter breaks snow-skiing in Col-
orado, adding that such ski resort
towns as Vail, Steamboat Springs

and Breckenridge are popular.

The two travel agencies said Mex-
ico, the Caribbean and Florida were
the most popular destinations during
spring break.

“Mexico is a wonderful deal,”’ said
Roscher, ‘‘because the U.S. dollar
has a lot of buying power there still.”’
She said such areas as Cancun and
Cozumel are very popular since they
have lower rates than many other
areas

‘Generally we send more people to
the Caribbean and Florida for Spring
Break,” said Collins. She said that
the Bahamas and Cayman Islands

were specially good for diving and
snorkeling. Roscher and Collins both
agreed that Florida was especially
popular among students who prefer-
red to save money by driving rather
than flying.

Collins said she had only one piece
of advice for W&L students who are
flying home for the holidays.

“Don’t wait until the last minute to
make reservations for low-fare
flights.’’ She added that seating was
limited and that it has been ‘‘impossi-
ble’ since last month to find good
fares on flights through Roanoke for
Thanksgiving
 

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, November 12, 1987

 

Giving:

Gifts help students

This Saturday is National Philanthropy Day, honoring the
many people who have given their time, talent and money to
help further education, charity and social causes. This
honorary day was enacted by a joint resolution in the United
States Congress.

Everyone at Washington and Lee should remember its first
major benefactor, George Washington. His generous gift of
canal stock, which is still drawing dividends today, saved the
university from obscurity, paving the way to its present na-
tional prominence.

The entire student body benefits from philanthropy. Even
students who pay all tuition, room and board costs receive
financial aid. Because of gifts to the university, costs are
lowered for everyone. Not only that, many buildings and
facilities are here as the result of gifts from people who care
— the future of the university and those who graduate

rom it.

William Wordsworth wrote, ‘The best portion of a good
man’s life (are) his little, nameless, unremembered acts of
kindness and love.”

We at The Ring-tum Phi do not want those acts that have
benefited this university to go unremembered. We would like
to express our gratitude to those individuals who have
dedicated their time and effort to the furtherance of
Washington and Lee. Without them it would not be the high-
level institution it is today.

Control

Recently there has been a problem with the supply of Ring-
tum Phis available for students, faculty and subscribers.

In the past the newspapers have been available in the lobby
of the University Center on Thursday evenings, as well as in
the dining hall and University Library. However, in the past
weeks, entire bundles of papers have been removed,
resulting in a shortage of papers. Because of this, many
students have not received papers, and the Phi has had pro-
blems meeting its subscription requirements.

Students pay for The Ring-tum Phi in their student activity
fee, and subscribers pay $25 to receive the paper for the en-
tire school year. Those who do not receive their paper are not
getting what they have paid for.

Everyone needs to remember that they do not pay for a
bundle of newspapers every week. In particular, fraternities
need to inform their pledges to only bring as many
newspapers as are needed for their houses. No fraternity on
this campus needs 150 to 200 papers at Thursday night dinner.

Everyone please take heed of this. It would be unfortunate
if the newspaper staff were forced to distribute the
newspapers in a different manner.

theatre
MY VIEW

By James Lake

 

Even though it’s probably too late,
I thought I might as well take one last
shot at introducing reason into the
plans for Washington and Lee’s new
multi-million dollar theatre. My
primary concern is not the price
tag—although there is an awful lot of
money involved. I’m mostly worried
about the fact that the main theatre
will seat only 425 people—that’s less
than one-third of the student body to
you and me.

A spokesman for the administra-
tion has said that there’s no
demonstrated need for a facility,
other than the Warner Center, that
will seat the entire student body. The
response to that is obvious: the
University doesn’t hold events that it
expects all students to attend
because there’s no such facility
available. Of course there aren’t any
campus-wide events indoors—there’s
no place to put everybody. The ad-
ministration’s argument is
analagous to saying a_ school
shouldn’t have home basketball
games because it doesn’t have a
gym; obviously, you have to have a
gym to have the cames in the first
place.

I can’t think of a better argument
for a 1500 to 2000-seat theatre than
last month's Parents’ Weekend Con-
cert in Lee Chapel. All this talk about
a facility large enough to hold the en-
tire student body for events such as
the Founders’ Day and Opening Day
Convocations has left out the people
whose dollars keep the school
running—Mom and Dad. Parents and
students attending the Choral and In-
strumental Concert on October 30
were standing in the aisles
throughout the two-hour event—nice
hospitality, W&L! According to the
W&L News Office, the chapel seats
approximately 625—that’s right, 200
more than the new theatre would.
And, with a new singing group star-
ting next term—the Women’s
Chorus—the over-crowding in. the
chapel can only get worse, as more
parents try to see their sons and
daughters perform. The people in
Washington Hall should keep in mind
the people who pay a large portion of
their salaries—the parents.

Another reason for a_ seating
capacity of four digits is the amount
of money involved. According to the
fund-raising brochure for the new
“Center. for the Performing Arts,”
current plans call for a ‘‘hydraulic-
powered orchestra lift,” a com-

puterized lighting system, ‘‘an or-
chestral shell of honeycomb
aluminum,” and a “shock-absorbing
floor’ for W&L’s  universally-
renowned dance program. If we're
going to spend all this money for
these neato, rinky-dink contraptions,
the entire student body certainly bet-
ter be able to get a lot of enjoyment
out of them.

There are plenty of other reasons
for a large auditorium/theatre. For
example, what if it had rained on
Jesse Jackson last spring? Gee, the
gym sure would’ve been elegant and
impressive on national television!
And how about bad weather for
graduation? Coach Daly can have a
free throw shooting contest for the
seniors while they wait for their
diplomas!

For a facility already estimated at
nine million dollars, there's no
reason why the architects can’t start
over and do this thing right. We’re
going to be using this building for a
long time. If the administration real-
ly wants the theatre to be ‘‘the heart
and soul of the campus,” if the in-
habitants of Washington Hall really
want the students to be ‘drawn even
more tightly together in the enjoy-
ment of the finest plays and con-
certs” as they claimed in their own
fund-raising brochure, then we
should be able to squeeze at least half
the student body in the place. Please,
Doctor Wilson and company: don’t
make a nine million dollar mistake.

 

 

 

 

Are longjohns valuable
as campus fashions?

 

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

During the course of my daily ac-
tivities on a recent Friday I noticed
that other students were staring at
me. At first I reasoned that the stares
were the product of some recent no-
ble act which I had committed in the
view of these staring students. But
not just a given population had their
eyes glued to me, everyone was star-
ing; staring not in admiration but in
disgust. It also occured to me that I
haven’t had the opportunity to do
anything noble since the boy scouts,
and I wasn’t even in the boy scouts.

The sad truth, I soon realized, was
that everyone was staring at my
clothing, more specifically my visi-
ble thermal underwear. I was
perplexed and wondered if there was
some presidential ordinance forbid-
ding thermal underwear of which I
alone remained unenlightened.

Possibly I had overlooked a nation-

wide boycott of long underwear
because they are manufactured by
the Soviet Union. I eliminated the
first theory because the president
wears thermal underwear and the se-
cond by a label check which proved I
was wearing American thermals.

‘‘Maybe I could just ask a starer,”’
I reasoned, but all seemed to hold a
great aversion to speaking to me in
public.

Finally I eavesdropped on a con-
versation concerning my garmets.
Apparently people were staring
because I looked ridiculous. This I
couldn’t believe. For one, owing to
my natural bad looks and lack of per-
sonal hygiene, -l usually look
ridiculous. Secondly, and more im-
portantly is that the very existence of
America is owed to poor dress habits.

Most of you probably learned in
grade school that the American
revolution came about because of
tea, stamps, and the fact that col-
onists were only allowed to drink
warm beer. This is a blatant lie.

What really happened is fashion
related. George Washington and
other patriots in the British Army
grew tired of the same old red coats.

LETTERS

So they made their own army and
allowed everyone to wear ridiculous
clothes. The British Army continual-
ly made fun of the Patriots’ bad taste
in clothing. The Patriots, who got
sick of being the butt of jokes in well-
known taverns, declared war.

So if it wasn’t for bad dress habits
you might be going to ‘“‘George the
Third and His Boring Family’
University instead of Washington
and Lee.

In fact, all social change since
before Cro-Magnum man was a pro-
duct of ridiculous-dressing. Could
Ghandi have accomplished what he
did without his offensive wardrobe?
Or moving closer to home, would
Professor Dytachek be the same
calculus teacher without his ties?
Think about it. .

And the next time you're about to
put on something which says
“Duckhead”’ on it, stop yourself. In-
stead, call up your parents and have
the clothes they wore in the 60’s sent
to you by Federal Express. Next,
wear these clothes. Within a short
period of time you can run for presi-
dent, and win, start a revolution, or
free political prisoners all over the
world.

 

 

To the Editor:

Lately I find myself looking forward to Thurs-
day evenings. This is not on account of some
special meal at the dining hall or the Cosby
Show, rather the occasion is the distribution of
the Ring-tum Phi. This fall’s paper has been
among the best I’ve seen in my years at W&L.
However, I have some criticism for your
coverage of the injuries suffered by Rowan
Taylor and Chris Jerussi. The first part of this
letter offers some suggestions for Jim Lake and
Mike Shady—the authors of articles on the inci-
dent. The second part of my letter will deal with
questions for the Phi’s editorial staff.

Mr. Lake provided an account of the accident,
but I feel he neglected to examine the cir-
cumstances surrounding the injury in a critical
manner. Mr. Shady tells us that he would have
done some things differently than Mr. Fallon,
but at the same time he seems to be cautioning
us not to be too critical of Mr. Fallon’s actions.
Two boys were hurt in that scrimmage—one of
them severely. A halftime scrimmage is
something out of ordinary and I feel Mr. Fallon’s
decision to hold one had a direct bearing on those
injuries suffered.

Football is a game where serious injuries do
occur I’m sure Mr. Lake and Mr. Shady know
that. But, do they know that the relationship of
fatigue to injury has been well-established? The
more tired a player becomes the more likely he
is to be seriously injured. Mr. Fallon’s decision
to hold a full contact drill increased the risk of in-
jury to his players in three respects: (1) scrim-
maging at halftime had the affect of lengthening
the first half—forcing the players to be on the
field a longer time than they are normally ac-
customed (2) scrimmaging deprived the players
of the recovery necessary to their maintaining
strength during the second half of the game (3)
the full-contact nature of the drills had the effect
of unnecessarily lengthening the duration of the
contact.

Mr. Fallon must explain whether or not he con-
sidered the risk associated with fatiguing his
player when he decided to conduct the drills.
Further, it must be determined whether or not
Mr. Fallon intended the scrimmage to be a kind
of punishment for the team's poor first-half per-
formance.

Why would Mr. Fallon decide to order his
charges into a situation which would put them at
serious risk? Mr. Fallon states that his purpose

 

for having the players engage in a full-contact
drill was ‘‘to instill aggressiveness.’’ He felt he
had ‘‘to do something to shake the cobwebs out of
our players’ heads.” He wanted the players to
“go back to the basics of good aggressive block-
ing and aggressive tackling.’’ Why didn’t the Phi
ask him what he meant by those statements? Mr.
Fallon needs to define precisely the meaning of
his term ‘“‘aggressiveness.’’ He owes an explana-
tion of what it means to want “to shake the
cobwebs’ out of players’ heads.

I was disturbed by the news the injuries suf-
fered during a school-sponsored activity. I am
concerned because I have not seen an adequate
explanation of the circumstances surrounding
the incident. I am anxious because I have seen no
assurance that a similar halftime scrimmage
won’t be allowed to occur. I am frightened
because the next time I might be reading about a
student being paralyzed or killed. The Phi has a
responsibility to speak for the student body. It
must remind the University that faculty and
staff who cannot demonstrate the emotional
maturity and the professional competence
necessary to assure the safety of student must be
dismissed. The responsibility that the University
bears towards it students demands nothing less.

Reader defends cheering

Ms. Pierson:

Despite what you may feel about W&L men
cheering for athletic teams from the women’s
colleges, I (and many others) obviously we feel
W&L men have every right to cheer for
whomever we please at an athletic event.

My sympathy for your sentiments about
rooting for the W&L women’s teams runs about
as deep as the tradition of women at W&L itself.
This is not tosay that W&L men have not and will
not encourage our own teams, both men’s and
women’s, but we have every right to cheer for
whichever team we choose.

There have been women at Hollins and Sweet-
briar much longer than there have been women
at W&L if you wonder why members of the class
of 1988 and others choose to cheer for the
women’s colleges.

If you do not like hearing W&L guys cheer for

Reader questions Fallon’s actions in halftime scrimmage

teams from other colleges I suggest you either
pay more attention to the game, move to the

Thanks to APO

Dear Editor:

Once again we would like to thank John
Deighan, Service Vice-president, and the
members of Alpha Phi Omega, who gave of their
time and talents by volunteering at the
Rockbridge Regional Library, on Sunday after-
noon, October 4, from 2:00 to 4:30 p.m.

These men and women worked very hard to
shelf read the fiction collection, putting books in
the right places, straightening, and shifting the
crowded areas of the library stacks.

Last year the APO team worked on the non-
fiction adult shelves, and they have remained in
relatively good condition. However, the fiction
collection really got ahead of us. Once more this
powerful force moved in and brought relief to a
very congested and disheveled area. We ap-
preciate this hard work so much!

The library staff and users have marvelled
that APO has been so faithful in helping us! We
want your readers to know how much both Sun-
days of service have meant to the library and to
the community. Thank you, John Deighan and
APO!

Sincerely,
Linda L. Krantz
Library Director

Parents Weekend books up area hotels

 

By Abb Jones
Staff Reporter

 

“We were full.”’

“We were full.”’

“We were full.”’

This past weekend, practically
every hotel, motel and motor lodge in
Lexington was filled to capacity as
the parents of Washington and Lee
University students descended upon
Lexington for parents’ weekend. Now
area hotels are counting their
revenue taken in from the latest in
the year’s series of big money-
making weekends.

Of six area hotels and motels con-
tacted, all were filled to capacity
both nights of parents’ weekend, with
most already full for next year’s
parents’ weekend.

“VMI and W&L reunions and
parents’ weekends are always
strong, as are the graduations,”’ said
Ramada Inn manager Bill Seay. He
added that 97 percent of last
weekend’s business was from the

parents of Washington and Lee
University students.

However, Joani  Hoffnagle,
manager of Holiday Inn, said that
W&L’s parents’ weekend is only one
drop in the financial bucket when it
comes to big college events.

‘Parents’ weekend is only one
weekend. Any of the college
weekends, such as alumni weekends,
parents’ weekend and _ football
weekends are substantial for
business,” she said. Hoffnagle added
that there are about 12 to 15 of these
types of weekends per year for W&L
and VMI combined.

“Graduation weekend is usually
the biggest weekend for both W&L,
and VMI,” said Days Inn manager
Sandra Hatter.

‘Well, we have other events, but
anytime we have W&L or VMI events
we fill up,” said Annie Blackwell,
employee at the Comfort Inn.

Blackwell said the Comfort Inn
does not use a waiting list, and that,
like other area motels, reservations
are done on a “‘first come, first serv-

ed”’ basis starting one full year in ad-
vance.

Hatter added that Days Inn also
begins booking reservations a full
year in advance. However, Days Inn
refuses to reserve all of the rooms.

‘We've got 152 rooms and we
reserve 130 of them. The rest we save
for off-the-road people.”

Hatter said that Days Inn reserva-
tions usually fill up ten months in ad-
vance, and it doesn’t keep a waiting
list.

Maxie Holland, manager of Best
Western-Keydet General on Rt. 60
East, said they were booked full
since last year and are already book-
ed for next year’s parents’ weekend.

“We put out a list and have our
guests sign up for next year while
they are here,”’ she said.

Ramada Inn manager Bill Seay
said Ramada Inn is unlike other area
motels because they wait two weeks
after annual events to begin taking
reservations for the next year’s
event. He added that they usually are
filled within two days after reserva-

Album stands up for animal rights

PETA is the nation’s fastest grow-

“In addition to W&L, VMI and
Sem, we get guests from such schools
as Virginia Tech, U.Va., and even
JMU. Often times people attending
events at these schools can’t get a

course we get a lot of overflow,” said

W&L senior tells of his experiences during his year in the far east

 

By Heidi Read
Staff Reporter

They lay it on thick and hope you
catch on,” said senior Forrest Can
non of the profossors at the Chinese

University of Hong Kong where he
spent last year

“And,” he added, ““‘It isn’t any
easier when their explanation is in
Chinese.”

Despite his two years of Mandarin
Chinese at W&L, Cannon said he was
still at a disadvantage in the
classroom because the main dialect
of Chinese spoken in Hong Kong is
Cantonese. The written language is
the same

By far, Cannon said, the hardest
adjustment was the language. He
said most classes are similar to those
at W&L and added that in a math
course they went through the whole
book

‘The international finance classes
and math classes are comparable to
anything we have here,” he said.

During his two semesters in Hong
Kong, Cannon traveled to Canton and
Tokyo

97 . hh
Focusing

He said the difference in the cities
was obvious. Canton was more
‘dreary and pale. It is a much slower
pace of life, but it is the most
Chinese,’’ Cannon said. “‘It’s like go-
ing 100 years into the past,’’ he said.

“Tokyo,”’ he said, “is more hip,
while Hong Kong is like a bustling
metropolis. The attitude there is
more serious and businesslike.”’

Traveling to other places in East
Asia made Cannon appreciate the
United States.

“We are free from the major
depressed areas [that exist in
Asia],’’ he said. he added, “It gave
me a more mature perspective on the
world.”

This perspective is evident in the
way Cannon describes the people of
Hong Kong and some of the problems
that exist there.

He said most of the people in Hong
Kong are third-generation im-
migrants from China.

“They are competitive, hardwork-
ing, proud of their heritage and con-
cerned about their future,’’ Cannon
said.

For example, most of the textbooks

ra
cs

 

&

% z
on the issues

are written in English. Thus they
must learn English and learn the
material in the text.

Further describing life in Hong
Kong, Cannon mentioned the corrup-
tion that existed.

“Bribery is a way of life there, it
isn’t perceived as an immoral act,”
he said. ‘‘The Chinese have a very
sophisticated understanding of
where officials are coming from,”’ he
said, ‘“They know how far they can
stretch them.”

Cannon added that there will soon
be evidence of change in the Hong
Kong that he visited.

“There’s more free-wheeling now
than there will be in 10 years,” he
said. When the Communists move in
when the lease on Hong Kong ex-
pires, ‘‘the questions of free press,
free business activity and free
market” will pervade.

With regard to the East Asian
Studies Program, Cannon said
W&L’'s program is very worthwhile
and recommends it for the student
who wants to challenge himself.

However, he said that a year is too
long for the person who is not ge-

nuinely interested in another culture.

Cannon said, ‘‘The person must be
dedicated and enjoy doing things out
of the ordinary.”’

Cannon thought the program facul-
ty should try harder to promote it.
“Instead of having a_ specific
technical ability, the East Asian
Studies Program gives you a unique
background,”’ he said. “I think it will
be more practical in the years to
come. Too many people have cultural
blinders on,”’ he added.

Professor Roger Jeans, Director of
the East Asian Studies Program,
said they are trying to promote the
opportunities for semesters abroad,

General

but student interest is very low. He
called it a ‘lean year.”’

He attributed part of the lack of in-
terest in the fact that few East Asian
history courses were taught last year
since he was on leave.

Because of the lack of student in-
terest, Jeans has postponed the
meeting to choose students to ex-
change with The Chinese University
of Hong Kong, Rikkyo University in
Tokyo and Kansai Gaidai in Osaka,
Japan.

Currently, there are six students at
these universities.

All three universities are full ex-
changes. That means the student
pays his tuition at W&L and switches

Football ends losing streak against Ursinus

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

The streak snaps, Coffland cranks,
and Fallon finally has number 49.

The Washington and Lee football
Generals scored 14 points off of two
second-quarter Ursinus turnovers
and hung on for their first win in over
a month Saturday, defeating Ursinus
College, 21-7, to end a four-game los-
ing streak and to give head coach
Gary Fallon his 49th victory at
Washington and Lee, the most wins
ever by a W&L football coach.

While the defense played perhaps
its best game of the season, senior
tailback Chris Coffland had the game
of his career, rushing for 189 yards
and two touchdowns on 35 carries.

“We were really pleased with
Chris,” said Fallon. “If I look back
over my ten years here, I don’t think
I could find a more intense and a
tougher football player.”

The game was a scoreless, three-
downs-and-punt defensive struggle
for the entire first quarter and most
of the second, until the turnovers
began.

First, Ursinus fumbled away a
W&L punt at its own six yard-line,

five-kilometer course in a time of
20:25. Cason’s time lowered her ail-
course school record by 18 seconds
and she was named ODAC Runner-
of-the-Year and all-conference.

“T didn’t have any strategy,’’ said
Cason. “I usually start out slow and
then pick up the pace with each mile
faster than the previous one. I sprint
the last part if I’m close.”

“‘’m very pleased for her,” said
head coach Jim Phemister. ‘She ran
very strongly. She did what she need-
ed to do to win.”

Despite Cason’s performance, the
women’s team finished a disappoin-
ting third in the team standings.
Eastern Mennonite, the favorite,
took the team title with 31 points,
Lynchburg came in second place
with 37 points, W&L scored 55 points
for third and Emory and Henry was
way back in the pack, scoring a
whopping 102 points for fourth place.
What made the third-place finish so
disappointing was the fact that the
Generals had defeated Lynchburg in
a tri-meet two weeks ago.

“Tt —— was in the range of

and junior Mike Holifield was there
to recover for the Generals. The W&L
offense took the field and immediate-
ly gave the ball to Coffland, who was
in the end zone while the Ursinus
defenders were still buckling their
chin straps. With 6:53 left in the first
half, freshman kicker Carter Quayle
gave the Generals a 7-0 lead.

The Bears took the ensuing kickoff
and drove to midfield, where senior
safety Tommy Donahoo halted that
drive with an interception—Ursinus
turnover number two. Sophomore
quarterback Phil Sampson went deep
on first down to—who else—split end
Hugh Finkelstein, and the 49-yard
pass completion gave the Generals a
fist down at the Ursinus two. Coffland
scored his second touchdown of the
day to cap a two play, 51-yard drive,
and Quayle added the extra point
with 44 seconds left in the first half.

The first sustained drive of the
game was put on by Ursinus in the
third quarter, ending on a five-yard
touchdown pass from quarterback
Kevin Parker to split end Kevin
Ross. The extra point cut W&L’s lead
to seven with 6:28 left in the third
period.

With its lead in jeopardy, W&L
decided to tell Coffland his real name

possibility that we would [come in se-
cond],’’ said Phemister, ‘‘but we still
don’t have enough depth yet. I think
it’s developing. We got third place
last year and we got third place again
this year but we were very much
more in the race this year. We’ll be
there very soon, I think. We’re just
not quite ready yet.”’

The other scorers for the Generals
were freshmen Shawn Wert (9th,
22:11) and Margaret Boyd (13th,
23:18) and juniors Anne Geary (15th,
23:30) and Stephanie Smith (17th,
23:49).

The Generals travel to Newport
News this weekend to compete in the
Eastern Regionals. Phemister is
anxious to see how Cason performs
against a fast field on a fast course.

“T’ll be curious to see what she
does at regionals,” he said. ‘“She’ll
havea little bit more competition and
she’ll find out a little bit more about
just how good she is. She’s quite a
good runner.”’

Phemister doesn’t forsee Cason
qualifying for the Division III Na-
tional ere unless she

was John Riggins, and the tailback
began cranking out the yardage and
running out the clock just like the
former Redskin running back.

“They were so intent on stopping
our wide outs and our passing game
that they did leave themselves
vulnerable to our run game,” said
Fallon. “Our offensive line did a
super job, and Chris Coffland did
some outstanding running.”’

Meanwhile, the W&L defense con-
tained any possible Ursinus rally by
holding the Bears to just 82 yards
rushing, easily the Generals’ best
defensive performance this year.
Junior linebacker Tom Skeen had
one of his best games ever, according
to Fallon, leading an “‘intense perfor-
mance” by the W&L defenders.

The Generals added an insurance
touchdown on a fourth-quarter pass
from Sampson to Finkletein. The
kick by Quayle with 7:13 left in the
game made the final score 21-7.

Fallon’s career record of 49 wins
puts him at the top of a list of some 26
men who have been in charge of
organized football at W&L since 1899,
when head coach T.G. Trenchard led
the Genereals to a 1-5-2 season
record. Saturday’s win put Fallon
ahead of Lee McLaughlin, whose

 

Paige Cason

takes individual honors. In last
year’s regional, which were held on
W&L’s course, the top runner ran
three to four minutes faster than
Cason’s best time on the course.

“There is probably going to be so-
meone at the regionals who runs on
that flat course maybe in the 17’s,,’
said Phemister. ‘“‘Paige isn’t ready
for that yet. She may come under
20. ”

in third place in the championships.

the site for the 1985 championships

“McHenry. ‘‘I am particulary pleased

‘ethis might give us an opportunity to
“win a national championship. We
ithave not, previously, won a national

~Kalamazoo, Mich. in the finals the
“last two years, are ranked No. 1 in

»W&L returns five players from last
year’s squad, including juniors
‘Robert Haley and Bobby Matthews,
who are ranked No. 3 and No. 4 in
‘singles, respectively, by the ITCA.
»The Generals also return the ITCA
No. 1-ranked doubles team in the na-
‘tion in Matthews and senior David
McLeod. All three players garnered
‘all-America honors in last year’s
sehampionships at Salisbury State
College.
* In its process of choosing a site, a
number of factors are looked at by
the NCAA. According to the 1987
»NCAA Tennis Handbook, the follow-
ing criteria are used in the selec
‘tion process: (1) quality and

availability of the facility and other
necessary accommodations; (2)
revenue potential and (3) geographic
location. W&L was also helped by
what many considered its excellent
handling of the 1985 tournament.

“T think the reason that we were
selected was that we did a fine job,”’
said McHenry. ‘‘We did an excellent
job of hosting [two years ago] and
everyone complimented us on the
way it was done.”

“It’s just kind of the way the ball
bounces,’’ said W&L head tennis
coach Gary Franke. “Anybody can
host it. Anybody can put in a bid. We
just happened to be selected. We also
happen to have a great place to host a
championship and everybody was ex-
cited by the fact that it was coming
back to Washington and Lee.”’

Franke also said the condition of
the courts was an important issue.
W&L just completed the resurfacing
of its lower tennis courts and will
resurface its upper courts during the
school’s exam period in April of 1988.

‘We decided to host it this year,
basically because we had the ap-
proval to redo the courts, which I
thought was necessary and the most
important thing about the tourna-
ment,”’ said Franke.

“We did have to resurface the
courts to make sure that the lower
courts and the upper courts would be
in top shape for the tournament,”
said McHenry. ‘‘We want to host the
best tournament possible. We want
everything to be just fine for it.”

McHenry said Emory University
was the other school under con-
sideration along with W&L. Emory
had already been awarded the oppor-
tunity to host the 1987 Div. II]
women’s national championships, so,
according to McHenry, the NCAA
decided it did not want one school
hosting both tournaments.

on Friday. He may not run anymore
for us. It’s a very painful sort of
thing.”

Senior co-captain Scott Rippeon
was W&L’s top finisher, grabbing
third place with a time of 26:14 over
the eight-kilometer course. Junior
Bill Clark (6th, 26:37) was close
behind, and both Rippeon and Clark
earned all-conference honors for
their efforts. Senior co-captain Rick
Norris (14th, 28:42), freshman Larry
Pilkey (17th, 28:59) and senior Greg
Casker (22nd, 30:03) round out the
scoring for W&L.

The loss of Moore definitely hurt
the General’s chances of taking se-
cond place in the team standings.

Miller was pleased with Rippeon’s

tougher competition in the Eastern

end Gar Prebor, and split ends
John Roe and Hugh Finkelstein.

The Hoyas (5-2-1) have won
their last four games and are ‘‘an
excellent football team,” accor-
ding to W&L head coach Gary
Fallon. ‘They play a wide-open
game offensively and have a

Defensively, Fallon said the

Every now and then a musician

will write a melody or lyric that
reaches in and grabs your emotions
by the throat. When it happens, a
surge of feeling rushes through your
body that suddenly makes you think
These pieces are usually few and far
between; but, occasionally a musi
cian will compose a few in a row. In
Nothing Like the Sun,’ Sting
creates enough to last a lifetime
There is no question that Sting has
taken his music to a higher plane in
the new release. The songs are
thicker, more rich, and musically
finer than the ones that preceded
them on “Dream of the Blue
Turtles."’ Although Sting still seems
to be fixated on the heart and world
oppression, the songs simply say
more than they did before
The lyrics will enrage you one
minute and make you cry the next.
The views that Sting has developed
as a member of Amnesty Interna-
tional clearly come out in the songs of
‘Nothing Like the Sun’’ just as
they did in “Dream of the Blue
Turtles.’’ Like U2, another Amnesty
member, Sting’s lyrics are not just
words on paper accompanying a
melody. The words mean something.
Textually, the album is very well
balanced. Side one begins with an
upbeat tune called “The Lazarus
Heart,” and the laid back ‘‘Be Still
My Beating Heart.’’ Side two opens
with another uptempo song ‘‘We’ll Be

‘Heaven’

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

Part of living is coping with the
reality that everyone has to die and
considering what will happen to you
when that day comes. Many believe
that they will go to heaven when they
die. Yet, for such a universal idea, it
is strange to consider how many con-
ceptions there are of what “heaven”
really is. For many it is a resting
place, and for others, complete
euphoria. For Kelly McGillis and
Timothy Hutton, heaven is a place
for making love in the clouds and fall-
ing in love.

“Made in Heaven’ will not be
remembered ten years down the road
for the impact that it had on its au-
diences or for the monumental in-
fluence that it has had on film.
Rather, it will be remembered for the
questions that it has clarified. For in-
stance, did you know that:

1. In heaven, all you have to do is

Together” and “Straight to My
Heart,,’ a spanish, almost flamenco
flavored song. As if it weren't ob-
vious from their titles, all four songs
deal with affairs of the heart

The middle sections of both sides
deal with: random subjects. Side
one’s “Englishman in New York”
was written for a friend of Sting’s
who moved from London to New
York in the early seventies. Its com-
position is wonderful moving from a
bouncy, almost circus-like melody to
a jazz riff, a rock drum solo, and then
back to the melody for the coda.
“Rock Steady”’ is a jazzy tune on the
second side that gives a modern tell-
ing of Noah’s Ark. ‘Sister Moon,” a
song about the magical mystique of
the moon, and a jazzy remake of Jimi
Hendrix’ ‘‘Little Wing”’ follow.

Both sides conclude with what is
lyrically and musically the finest
work of Sting’s career. Side A ends
with ‘History Will Teach Us
Nothing,” ‘‘They Dance Alone,” and’
“Fragile;"’ three songs that subtley
attack the horrors of war. The
album’s final cut is ‘“The Secret Mar-
riage,’ a song adapted from a
melody by Hans Eisler, a musician
who fled .to America to escape
persecution from the Nazis who chas-
ed him his entire life.

‘They Dance Alone”’
and’’F'ragile’’ are the finest pieces on
the album. Jn ‘‘They Dance
Alone,’’Sting sings about a dance
that the Chilean mothers, wives, and
daughters do for the soldiers who
have ‘‘disappeared’’ under

and you are immediately there.

2. There are IBM computers in
heaven. (I know some of you will be
glad to hear that.)

3. You can make love in heaven. (I
know the rest of you are glad to hear
that.)

Director Alan Rudolph has made a
delightful film in ‘‘Made in Heaven.”
The story centers around Mike
(Timothy Hutton), who is leaving his
home to find a job in California. He
never makes it. Mike drowns while
saving a woman and two children
from a submerged station wagon.
(Quit complaining, this all happens
in the first ten minutes of the film
anyway.)

Mike arrives in heaven (totally
nude which kind of scares me) where
he is greeted by his aunt Lisa
(Maureen Stapleton). She teaches
him how to think his way around and
off he goes. The fun begins when he
crash lands into Kelly McGillis’ liv-

ing room (no longer nude poor guy).
From here on, the film gets a touch
cliche’. Boy meets girl, boy falls in
love with girl, boy gets to know girl
biblically in a cloud, and so on and so
forth. Sweet and simple right? Nope.
One catch; some of those in heaven
return to earth as a baby at some
point and guess whose number is up?

I'm not going to say anything else
about the story other than the ending
could have been much better than it
is. Unfortunately, ‘‘Made in Heaven”
was made in Hollywood. (You'll see
what I mean.)

As for the film itself, it is shot and-
put together quite well. The
cinematography of Charleston, S.C.
(used in the heaven sequences) and
Atlanta (used in the earth sequences)
are beautiful. Especially the heaven
scenes shot by the lake. Hutton and
McGillis give good performances as
usual, as does Maureen Stapleton.

Perhaps the oddest thing about the:
film though is its number of cameos.
