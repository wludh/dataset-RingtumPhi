Recruiters place requirements on seniors

 

By Abb Jones
Staff Reporter

 

Although many W&L seniors are
gearing up for the all-important on
campus job recruiters’ interviews to
be conducted in two weeks, the
Career Development and Placement
Office is concerned that many
seniors are unaware of the re-
quirements job interviewers are
placing on them

“T have found that a group of
students who are unplaced each year
are people with grade-point averages
of 2.3 or lower. That nearly always is

the majority of the unplaced
students,”’ said Richard Heatley,

John D. Wilson, president of
Washington and Lee University, was
presented with the ‘‘Duffy Daugherty
Award” from Michigan State Univer-
sity on Nov. 25

The award’ named for the late
Hugh “Duffy” Daugherty, an MSU
football coach for 19 years, is

presented annually to an alumnus
who has distinguished himself on and
off the field

Wilson was given the award by
MSU teammate and athletic director
of MSU, Doug Weaver, at the annual
football banquet in East Lansing,
Mich.

“T was pleased [to receive the
award] because I admire Duffy,”
said Wilson. ‘‘He had a good sense of
humor and didn’t take himself too
seriously

“It gave me a chance to thank the
university for all it had done for me,”’
added Wilson

Wilson graduated from MSU in
1952. During his years at MSU, he
played defensive back for the Spar-
tans, who won the national cham-
pionship. He also was selected to play
in the North-South all-star game

Wilson was awarded the Western
Conference Medal for Scholarshin
and Athletic Prowess and the John A
Hannah Award for Distinction in
Academic and Athletic Achievement
He was also chosen to be on the first
Academic All-America football
team, which was selected in 1952.

Wilson attended Oxford Universi-
ty, where he earned an M.A., as a
Rhodes Scholar after graduating
from MSU

After serving in the U.S. Air Force
for two years, Wilson returned to
MSU to serve as assistant to the vice-

within a couple of wale major on-

they are not registered then they are
not qualified to have interviews on
campus.”’

Upon registration, students are
then allowed to sign up for interview
times with companies they are in-
terested in, so long as they meet the
requirements for each company.

Many of the companies interview-
ing at W&L in the upcoming weeks
require a minimum GPA of either 3.0
or 2.75, and several require a certain
amount of credit hours under specific
courses of study, as well as specific
majors.

Basketbal

By Sean Bugg
Editorial Page Editor

The mother of Len Bias, a college
basketball star who died of a drug
overdose, will speak at W&L as part
of the Drug and Alcohol Awareness
Week.

Lonise Bias will give ‘A Challenge
to Students and Adults to Wage War
Against Drugs” Jan. 22 at 7 p.m. in
Lee Chapel.

Bias’s speech will conclude a week
of programs designed to heighten the
W&L community’s awareness of
drug and alcohol abuse.

The week, which begins Monday,
Jan. 18, is being sponsored by the
Student-Faculty Health Education
Committee, and is being coordinated
by Associate Dean of Students Anne
P. Schroer Lamont and University

Heatley said that currently
than 165 seniors were registered with
the Placement Office and therefore
able to participate in the on-campus
recruitment interviews

“We have had a very busy fall in
preparing students for this event, so
we have encouraged seniors to
register with us in the fall,” he said

Heatley said that about 30 percent
of the seniors do not register with the
Placement Office because they plan
on attending law or graduate school
However, Heatley said that they
should register to open themselves to
job resources after they graduate
from law or graduate schoo!

Heatley added that some seniors do
not realize that when companies

didates, the companies are seeking to
fill a specific job and are not looking
to do general interviewing

“Students think that if a company
is represented on campus, that
whatever kind of position they would
want to apply for with that company
is what those interviews are for.”

The Placement Office held resume
writing and interviewing workshops
this week for students to improve
their resume-writing ability and see
themselves on videotaped inter
views. These workshops, which
Heatley said had very high turnouts,
will be continued throughout the
month

Two workshops will be conducted
by Bob Lynn, a member of the staff
of the Alcohol and Drug Treatment
Program at Lewis Hospital. Both are
scheduled for Thursday, Jan. 21.

The first workshop, ‘“Interven-
tion,” will begin at 3 p.m. in Northen

people learn how to approach so-
meone who might have a drug or
alcohol problem and get them to
recognize it, said Calkins.

The second workshop will begin at
7:30 in Lee Chapel and refers to
adults who grew up with an alcoholic
in the family and; and how they have
learned to deal with the problem

said Calkins

Calkins said there will be displays
in the University Co-op, Bookstore
and library during the entire week
Handout materials will be available
in the Bookstore and library.

Two videotape programs will be
shown in the Student Health Center,
located in Gilliam Dormitory. They
will be shown during sick call hours,
as well as times requested by in-
dividual students.

Calkins said the committee is also
considering showing a slide program
from the Lexington Police Depart-
ment at the library display.

The Inter-fraternity Council and
Contact will be co-sponsoring one of
the speakers.

Trident, the W&L women’s
organization, may also sponsor a
video presentation and discussion
one night during the week, said
Calkins.

Fewer classes taken pass/fail

By Heidi Read
Staff Reporter

 

Though the rules for taking classes
pass/fail haven't changed recently,
the number of pass/fail applications
has dropped more than 40 percent in
the last five years.

The current policy allows students
with at least a sophomore standing to
take only one course pass/fail per
term. However, only 18 hours of
pass/fail credit may be used toward
degree requirements. This limits the
number of pass/fail courses a stu-
dent may take to6 terms.

A pass/fail course cannot be in the
student’s major and it may not be ap-
plied toward a general education re-
quirement. Courses taken pass/fail
do not receive grade points.

According to University Registrar

D. Scott Dittman, W&L only has a
few classes that can only be taken
pass/fail. The student must petition
the professor of the course he or she
wants to take pass/fail. Dittman said
the pass/fail status is left to the pro-
fessor’s discretion, not the
Registrar’s Office.

John W. Elrod, Dean of the College,
said the reason for offering pass/fail
courses was for students to try new
courses in areas they were not
familiar with.

According to the W&L 1987 Fact
Book, the number of students taking
courses pass/fail has dropped 44 per-
cent in the last five years. Dittman
said various reasons could account
for this decrease in figures. ‘Some
institutions accept a passing grade
and convert it to a ‘C’, even though
the student may have passed the
course with a ‘D-’,”’ he said. ‘Other
institutions want to see a letter grade
for a course.’ He said tougher

transfer standards could be why
fewer students are taking pass/fai
courses, Dittman said W&L accepts
pass/fail grades from other institu
tions without requiring a_ letter
grade.

As the number of pass/fail courses
has dropped, the failure rate in the
courses has also dropped from 10.2
percent in 1982 to 4.1 percent in 1987
Just speculating, Dittman gave
several possible reasons for the
lower failure rate in pass/fail
courses. He said, ‘‘Better students
could be one reason. Also, professors
might not be as tough when grading
in a pass/fail course or pass/fail
courses may not be very hard.”’

Whatever the reason for the
decrease in the number of students
taking pass/fail courses, Elrod said
“Tt worries me because it means that
fewer students are trying new
courses.”’

OPINION

New Year’s
Resolutions

Well, the new year has arrived, and we want to assure
everyone that the season for resolutions has not passed us by
unnoticed. In fact, The Ring-tum Phi has made its own list of
resolutions. These are resolutions we would like to see made
in the Washington and Lee community, as well as some
resolutions of our own.

To begin, we would like the administration to resolve to
complete the construction on Gaines Residence Hall as soon
as possible. Even though the living quarters are very nice,
many of the advertised amenities, such as the computer
room and the gatehouse, have yet to be finished. We realize
that construction was rushed in order to have the building
ready to house students this year, but many of them decided
to live in the residence because of the advantages they
believed they would receive. It is only fair that those students
living there should be able to make full use of a completed
building.

Another resolution the university could make it to improve
the parking situation as soon as possible. We have recently
written about this in the Phi, and it has been discussed in the
past years. However, the problem seems to be continually
swept under the rug. We could go on for years talking about
how bad the problem is. But until the university takes
definite action on the problem it will never be solved and we
will continue to have demolition-derby parking lots (i.e. the
Corral). It must be remembered that parking not only affects
the W&L community; it affects the entire city of Lexington.

 

Turning to student organizations, let’s begin with the In-
dependent Union. Our wish is that the IU would resolve to
become a major part of university life. As it stands now,
there is no real reason for anyone to join the IU. They do offer
a cold test file, but what else? Just allowing independents to
participate in some intramural sports competitions is not
enough. The IU needs to plan more events and come up with
more services to entice people to join, and therefore make
another option for students who do not wish to join frater-
nities (or Trident, for that matter).

Speaking of fraternities, they have a hard battle ahead of
them if they want to defeat the proposal for a deferred Rush.
As has been said before in the Phi, there are many problems
inherent in a deferred Rush system. However, there are a
number of positive factors also. Fraternities need to show the
positive aspects of the traditional W&L Rush system (held at
the beginning of the fall term). But to do this, the fraternities
need to resolve to conduct themselves honorably during the
traditional Rush. This is the only way they can combat defer-
red Rush at the present time. Of course, they have done so
badly in the past, they may never get the chance to prove
themselves.

We believe the Interfraternity Council should resolve to
continue its positive growth. The IFC has shown this year
that it can be a viable governmental organization for the
fraternity system. During the tough times for fraternities
this is extremely important. Hopefully when IFC election
time rolls around, fraternities will realize they need to keep
competent people in control of the organization.

Moving quickly along to Trident, we hope they resolve to
throw a formal function this year that is a little bit quieter
than last year’s Confettis. What a bash.

The Ring-tum Phi has a few of its own resolutions. We hope
we can keep them all (barring unforseen acts of God or
nature).

We resolve not to run our editorial policy again, at least in
the editorial column itself. For those of you who missed it
during its numerous appearances fall term, it can be found
easily in most back issues of the paper. The deadline for let-
ters to the editor is in the staff box below this column.

We resolve to put out a parody issue at some point in this
year, hopefully even better than last year’s. We’re not going
to tell you when, though. It’s a surprise.

We resolve to cover the news at Washington and Lee to the
best of our abilities, and present a paper of the highest possi-
ble quality. We’re working hard, and we’ll be working even
harder in the coming term.

One Phi editor would like to resolve to make the bath mat
1988’s hottest fashion item.

We know this list cannot be comprehensive. There are
many resolutions that need to be made. Of course, if anyone
happens to have a particular resolution that they think should
be made, write about it in a letter to the editor. No one will
ever know about it if you don’t tell them.

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

Attending college far away from
home is good because it offers the
student exposure to the many joys of
travel. The luckiest and most
qualified students will later be
rewarded with jobs which demand
daily travel. I will discuss airline
travel because it is usually the most
efficient as well as a universal mode
of travel. A more important reason
for “his choice is that I flew at
Christmas and Thanksgiving and
harbor bitter grudges toward the
airline industry.

Returning to college from my
home in Tampa, Fla., at Thanksgiv-
ing went fine until Atlanta, where my
one-hour layover slowly turned into a
three-hour layover. The plane was
overbooked and could not take off un-
til someone took the airline’s offer
(bribe) of $175, a hotel for the night,
anda flight to Roanoke the next day.

Unfortunately, no one was enticed
enough to accept the offer. The

airline officials refused to believe
this and stubbornly repeated their of-
fer, without further embellishments.
This impasse continued until the at-
tendant was too hoarse to continue
(2% hours). For reasons unknown—
probably the airline exterminated an
inconspicuous passenger—we finally
got off the ground.

I knew something was wrong when
we were still in the air 45 minutes
after the pilot announced that we
were landing. Later we were told that
the fog was too heavy and we were
being taken to a semi-inhabited area
of West Virginia. I quickly recogniz-
ed the fog explanation as a covéfup
for airline vengeance. Obviously, the
company officials were still upset
because no one would accept their of-
fer in Atlanta. If the plane contained
enough fuel they probably would
have created a reason for taking us to
Albuquerque. For example:

“This is the captain. We have just
been informed by the President of the
United States that someone must
pick up a box of Apple Jacks in Albu-
querque and take it to the White
House. It seems the delivery is essen-
tial to keeping Communism out of

Activism is not just

 

MY VIEW
By Margaret Pimblett

 

I have a small button which I
recently began wearing on my over-
coat. It’s not presumptuous, or highly
noticeable. It’s just a subtle orange
button about an inch in diameter.

You may be wondering how I ex-
pect to write an entire column about
one little button. I’m wondering that,
myself. Well, it’s not the physical
button itself that means anything, it’s
the message that is printed on it. My
button says, ‘‘A Day Without Human
Rights is like a Day Without Sun-
shine.”

That’s a simple enough sentiment,
but you’d be surprised at the reac-
tions I’ve received because of it.

A friend of mine saw my orange
button, read it, and said (somewhat
jokingly), ‘Oh, Margaret, you're
such a liberal activist.

Huh??!?

I thought liberal activists were the
people who went on the Great Peace
March across the United States last
year, leaving their jobs and their
families for months at a time to help
draw attention to the need for world
peace.

Liberal activists are the ones who
sit in front of the White House with
skull makeup on their faces pro-
testing the Reagan administration’s

Central American policies.

Liberal activists are the members
of Greenpeace who had their ship,
the Rainbow Warrior, destroyed in
the waters off the coast of New
Zealand because they were pro-
testing the nuclear practices of
France. That incident relusted in the
death of one crew member and the
birth of the slogan, ‘‘You Can’t Sink a
Rainbow.”

Even musicians can be liberal ac-
tivists. Little Steven van Zandt has
sung about the sanctuary movement
in North America, the plight of the
American Indian, and of course, the
situation in South Africa. Peter
Gabriel’s anthem to Steven Biko, the
South African human rights activist
who was killed in a South African jail
in 1977, has a brand-new video which
includes clips of the film ‘Cry
Freedom”’.

And who can ignore the popularity
of U2, the band whose songs express
such a respect for human rights.
Every teeny bopper in America
learns the words to the latest singles
off their album.

But would you call a college stu-
dent who wears a button a liberal ac-
tivist? Come on.

The collegiate activists are the one
like Amy Carter, who was arrested
for protesting CIA recrutitment on
the campus of Brown University.
Even if she did fail out of school
because she was spending so much
time protesting, at least she’s pro-

America, and we're the closest plane
to Albuquerque.”’

Since I hate flying so much I was
just glad to get on the ground—even
if it was in an unknown area of West
Virginia. The rest of the passengers,
on the other hand, had an “I don’t
care if Roanoke is in the middle of a
nuclear winter; land there now!’’ at-
titude.

By the time I reached Lexington it
was 4 o’clock in the morning. Later, I
was informed by leading mathemati-
cians that I could have walked from
Atlanta to Roanoke faster than it took
me to fly. This was an outrage! Peo-
ple only fly because it is efficient, not
for enjoyment. Those of you who
would argue that the Wright brothers
and similar lunatics flew for enjoy-
ment are forgetting that airplane
food had not yet been invented. But
these days all airlines have airplane
food which totally eliminates the
possibility that any species of animal
could enjoy flying.

Flying at Christmas also proved to
be quite a learning experience. At ex-
actly 7:02 the airline attendant in-
formed us that the previous depar-
ture time of 6:30 was being changed

bably satisfied with herself.

How about the young man at a
school elsewhere in the United States
(I think in California) who hung a
banner out of his dorm room window
that said, simply, ‘DIVEST’? He
was ordered by the school to remove
the expression of his opinion.

Then, of course, there were the
students at the University of Virginia
who built a shanty town on the Lawn
in front of the Rotunda.

Could we even imagine a group of
W&L students putting up shanties in-
front of the Colonnade? I doubt it.

We all know that Washington and
Lee is predominantly a conservative
campus. I haven’t seen any students
walking around with purple hair or
wearing outfits that would more like-
ly be found on the lead singer of a
band called ‘‘Crazed Thumbsuckers
from Hell’’.

But we do have some liberal
members of our student body, in-
cluding the members of the Young
Democrats. (In case you think this
column is becoming a plug for a
political party, guess again. I am not
a member of the Young Democrats. )

This column is becoming a plug for
interest and concern. Occassionally,
when I think about how my life would
be have been different had I chosen
not to attend Washington and Lee,
I wonder if I would have become an
activist in the style of the
Greenpeace members and Little
Steven.

Instead, I attend a school with im-

 

to 6:45. Obviously the airline had -
figured out a way to transcend time.
Not only did I realize that airline per-
sonnel speak a different language but
IT actually learned to translate it.

For instance, when an airline of-
ficial says ‘‘Your flight will depart as

soon as we finish loading a few suit- *

cases,’ he’s really saying ‘The
engine won’t start and the only
mechanic is on vacation.”’ If he says,
“We'll have you in the air as soon as

we finish up a little maintenance *

work,”’ he means, ‘‘We can’t locate
your plane, check back in six hours.”
Hopefully he’ll never say, ‘Your
plane will be landing shortly,’’’ but if
he does, he means, ‘‘We don’t have a
plane for your flight. I hope you have
a sleeping bag.”

Maybe I’m exaggerating a little.
With the exception of the airline los-
ing my luggage, Christmas flying
was not that bad. As a matter of fact I
owe tne airlines a lot. If they had not
lost my luggage last year when I in-
terviewed for college, I never would
have gotten into this school. At least I
had an excuse for my appearance.
Otherwise I would have been re-
jected immediately.

peccable academic standards, a
beautiful physical campus and
natural surroundings, a talented and
widely-respected faculty, and the
legacy of two Americans of integrity.

But W&L does not have a history of
student activism, and its students
may perhaps have missed a poten-
tially life-changing experience.

Could it be that Washington and
Lee University needs to develop
more of a humanitarian conscience?

There was an attempt last year, at
least. A group of students, law and
undergraduate, tried to form a
chapter of Amnesty International,
the human rights organization that-
tries to obtain the release of
prisoners of conscience. Does that
student group still exist? If not, does
at least the idea and hope survive of
forming some sort of group with
respect for human rights as its basis?

If we need a role model, we need
only look as far as the Law School for
Professor Gregory Stanton. He,
along with his wife, have been at-
tempting to rectify some of the
human rights violations in Kam-
puchea, the country formerly known
as Cambodia, where the regime of
Pol Pot was in power in the 1970s.

With that cause and Stanton’s suc-
cesses as inspirations, perhaps some
of the students of W&L can expand
their myopic viewpoint of the world
in which we live, and begin to do
more than just wear little orange but-
tons on our coats. Maybe.

Kimbrough wills gift to Austin Peay State University

 

From Staff Reports

Through a bequest of the late Dr.
Emory Kimbrough Jr., former head
of the W&L sociology department,
Austin Peay State University in Ten-
nessee has received the largest
private gift in its history.

Terms of the will specify that the
gift, which was in the approximate
sum of $485,000, is to be used to
establish scholarships in honor and
memory of Kimbrough’s parents,
Martha Beaumont Kimbrough of
Clarksville. Tenn.. and the late

Emory Sr., who served as president
of the First Trust and Savings Bank
which is now Sovran Bank.

According to APSU President
Robert O. Riggs, although Kim
brough’s primary interest was
sociology, he designated that the
scholarship established through his
bequest be for students in any field of
study, with the intent of attracting
academically talented students to
APSU. Riggs said, ‘‘It is particularly
meaningful that such a renowned
academician and _ distinguished
scholar would recognize the impor-
tance of Austin Peay to his
hometown. His magnanimous gift to
the university is indicative of his

Roanoke Comedy
Club sells laughs

 

By Alex Sutton
Staff Reporter

 

The Roanoke Comedy Club is a
joke.

Anda very good one at that.

Located in the Down the Hatch
Lounge at the Patrick Henry Hotel,
the club runs shows every Wednes-
day through Saturday night in front
of packed audiences who certainly
have found a good time.

Owner Jim Butler says the talent
at his club is excellent.

“Of course we're not going to get
the [Whoopi] Goldbergs, the [Robin]
Williams or the [Richard] Pryors
here,’’ Butler says, ‘‘but we are get-
ting that level right below them... the
comedians on their way up.”

“After all,’’ he says, ‘‘where do you
think all of those big names
started?”

Among the comedians who have
done their act at the Roanoke Com-
edy Club are Rosey O’Donnel,
Margaret Smith and Alfa Trivette.

Smith has appeared on a Home Box
Office comedy special while O’Don-
nell has appeared on T.V.’s Star
Search. Trivette has done spots in
both television and movies.

Butler says he books comedians
from all over the U.S. and Canada to
perform at his club.

On Wednesdays, however, he
doesn’t book anyone because it is
“Local Talent Night” at the club.

On this night people from the au-
dience are encouraged to come up on
stage and perform for five minutes.
Butler says the people who do come
up “have guts” because it is “‘not as
easy as everyone thinks.”’

And although the audience can

sometimes be tougher than usual on
the amatuers some of the talent that
comes up is a ‘“‘howl’’, according to
Butler.

The crowd is also very active on
the other nights when the 90-minute
shows can become ‘‘not filthy, but
pretty dirty”, according to Butler.

He says that “‘if the crowd is really
into it and gets the comics going, you
can expect the comebacks and in-
sults to start flying.’’ Butler says the
comics’ material is “‘phenomenal.”’

Although a person must be 21 years
old to order alchohol at the club,
Butler says all students from W&L
are welcome.

He explains that those underage
people in a party will be seated
together and will not be able to buy
alcohol. Butler points out that the ex-
ception to this rule is on Saturdays
and sometimes Fridays when no one
underage will be admitted.

The reason for this exclusion, ac-
cording to Butler, is because the
crowd on those nights is too big to ac-
comodate everybody.

Butler says that besides ac-
comodating all W&L students at this
club, he would also be willing to
organize some shows in Lexington.

“That is definitely possible and
could be worked out’’, says the
owner.

Butler explains that he could simp-
ly extend the booking calender of the
comedians performing at his club on
weekend, and send them up to W&L
during the week.

Shows at the Roanoke Comedy
Club begin at 8:30. There are addi-
tional shows at 11:00 on Fridays and
Saturdays. Admission is $4.00 on
Wednesday and Thursday, and $5.00
on Friday and Saturday. Butler sug-
gests calling for reservations.

VCU English professor
to give poetry reading

 

From Staff Reports

 

Award-winning poet Dave Smith
will give a reading from his works
Wednesday, Jan. 13. The reading,
which is open to the public, will be at
4:30 p.m. in the Northen Auditorium
of the University Library.

Smith has been twice the runner-up
for the Pulitzer Prize in Poetry (1979
and 1981) and a finalist for the Na-
tional Book Critic’s Circle Prize in
Poetry (1979). In 1981, he received a
Guggenheim Fellowship in Poetry
and a National Endowment for the
Arts Fellowship in Poetry. Other
awards include the Prarie Schooner
Poetry Prize, Portland Review
Poetry Prize, and the Ohio Universi-
ty Medal of Merit. In 1977, Smith
received honorable mention for the
Lenore Marshall Prize and has serv-

ed frequently as a judge for that
prize.

A native Virginian, Smith received
his B.A. with honors from the Univer-
sity of Virginia in 1965. He received
his master’s degree from Southern Il-
linois University and his Ph.D. with
honors from Ohio University in 1976.

Smith published his first book of
poetry, Bull Island, in 1970. Since
then, he has published numerous
books of poetry, a novel, and collec-
tions of essays. His most recent
books are Local Assays (essays)
(University of Illinois Press, 1985)
and The Roundhouse | oices: Selected
and New Poems (Harper & Row,
1985).

Smith is professor of English at
Virginia Commonwealth University,
where he has taught since 1982. His
visit to the Washington and Lee cam-
pus is sponsored by the Glasgow En-
dowment Program.

recognition.”

APSU Vice President Wendell H.
Gilbert said, ‘‘Kim and I remained
close over the years. It was a delight
during his visits to engage him in a
stimulating discussion. I always
learned something

‘He will be remembered for his in-
telligence. However, even more than
his brilliance, I miss his
thoughtfulness and kindness. He was
a truly good person.”’

At the time of his death on Jan. 8,
1987, Kimbrough was professor and
head of the department of sociology
and anthropology at W&L. Having
been named to Phi Beta Kappa, he
earned both his M.A. and Ph.D.
degrees from the University of North

Carolina at Chapel Hill.

He received his bachelor’s degree
in 1957 from Davidson College,
graduating cum laude. During his
graduate studies, he held Odum and
Woodrow Wilson fellowships.

Speaking of him, W&L President
John D. Wilson said, ‘‘He took a
special joy in his professional life; he
had a zestful appreciation for his
field and his students. Dr. Kim-
brough was a marvelous catalyst for
us all.”’

In addition to his mother, Kim-
brough is survived by his brother,
Ben Kimbrough of Clarksville,
retired vice chairman of the Com-
merce Union Corporation Board and

immediate past chairman of the AP-
SU Foundation. Austin Peay’s Col-
lege of Business is named in honor of
Ben Kimbrough.

During his tenure at W&L, Kim-
»rough served on various key univer-
sity committees and was published
often in such prestigious publications
as Social Forces, the Virginia Social
Science Journal and the Washington
and Lee Law Review.

In addition to serving as a visiting
professor at the University of North
Carolina, Hollins College and Chung
Chi College of the Chinese University
of Hong Kong, in recent years he par-
ticipated in seminars at Oxford
University in England.

Echoing the words of Wilson, an

obituary written by three ol niu-
brough’s colleagues, O. Kendall
White Jr., John McDaniel and David
Novack, and published in the Sum-
mer 1987 edition of The Southern
Sociologist, stated that he was an
outstanding professor striving
always to be ‘ ‘‘brilliant’’ and totally
dedicated to his students and his pro-
fession.

They wrote, “This past year was
probably one of the best in Emory’s
life. Students, past and present, were
acknowledging his contribution to
their lives; and his experience,
especially with his Chinese friends,
indicated that what he had chosen to
do in life had been done well and ap-
preciated.”’

Professor’s play opens in NYC

 

From Staff Reports

 

“The Last Resort,” the newest
play by W&L drama_ professor
Thomas J. Ziegler, opened recently
at the Triangle Theatre in New York
City. The play will run until Jan. 31.

The play is Ziegler’s third to be
professionally produced, joining
“The Ninth Step,’’ produced at the
Riverwest Theatre in New York in
1984, and ‘‘Strings,’’ produced in 1986
at the New City Theatre in Seattle.

A comedy/drama, “The Last
Resort” depicts the plight of six
elderly residents of the plush Sunset
Terrace Nursing Home on Long
Island, where calm and peaceful con-

ditions prevail, until the arrival of
Marjorie Kendrick.

Kendrick quickly realizes the
peaceful atmosphere of the nursing
home is maintained by the ad-
ministering of large doses of tran-
quilizers, barbituates and
painkillers. This practice is not
motivated by malice. It is simply
common nursing home eoonomics.
As a resident explains, ‘‘One little pill
can do the work of two or three
nurse’s aides.”’

When Kendrick envisions the re-
mainder of her life being spent in a
drug-induced coma, she prods the
other patients into action. The results
are a funny and moving testament of
courage, caring and a tenacious love
for life.

Ziegler’s play was inspired by the

‘Images of Africa’ coming

 

From Staff Reports

 

The Fine Arts Department is spon-
soring a show entitled ‘Images of
Africa”’ from Jan. 11 to Feb. 12 at du-
Pont Gallery

The show consists of six views of
Africa. One part deals with the
growth of cartographic knowledge of
Africa in European maps from the
16th to the 19th century and includes
maps of some of the most distinguish-
ed cartographers of the times.

A second part features artifacts
from the SaHelle, including masks,
cloth, tools, utensils, daggers and or-

naments. A third section focuses on
the culture of Ghana and neighboring
countries, displaying Ashanti
goldweights, cloth of the area, a
variety of pots and other artifacts il-
lustrating adaptive craftsmanship.

The fourth and fifth sections
highlight the Horn of Africa, with em-
phasis on traditional and modern ar-
tifacts.

The items on display come from
the collection of Winifred and Fred
Hadsel of Lexington and are based
primarily on their Foreign Service
tours of duty in Africa.

Of his nearly 30 years in the
American diplomatic service, Hadsel
spent 20 of them dealing with African

observations he made while visiting
an elderly relative in a nursing home.
The seeming lack of concern by
medical professionals who treat the
elderly led to research which reveal-
ed startling statistics. For example,
$100 million is spent in the U.S. each
year for drugs to tranquilize nursing
home patients, and approximately
30,000 residents die each year from
drug misuse.

Ziegler joined the W&L faculty in
1976 after teaching at the College of
the Virgin Islands and the University
of Toledo. He received his B.A. from
Lewis College and his master’s
degree from Northern Illinois. In ad-
dition to teaching courses in theatre
design, play production and
playwriting at W&L, he is the resi-
dent scene designer and playwright.

affairs. Serving in various posts in
Washington and abroad, he was am-
bassador to Somalia and then to
Ghana from 1969 to 1974. Hadsel was
director of the Marshall Foundation
for many years prior to his retire-
ment.

Mrs. Hadsel is the president of the
Rockbridge Historical Society and
formerly worked as a researcher and
writer for the Foreign Policy
Association and as a_ research
analyst for the State Department’s
Bureau of Intelligence and Research.

Fred Hadsel will give a_ slide
presentation and talk at 8 p.m.
Wednesday, Jan. 13, in the duPont
Hall auditorium. The public is in-
vited.

scholarship

From Staff Reports

 

 

Washington and Lee has received a
grant of $100,000 to establish a
scholarship in honor of the late E.P.
Tatum Smith Jr. of Roanoke, Va
Smith was a 1950 graduate of the
W&L law school.

The scholarship, which is open to
undergraduate and law students, is
made possible by a grant from the
William H. Donner Foundation of
New York, Inc. The Donner Founda-
tion is named after William H. Don-
ner, industrialist and philanthropist,
who sought to maintain exceptional
standards in the fields of medicine,
Native American affairs, and U.S.-
Canadian relations.

A native of Galax, Smith attended
the U.S. Naval Academy. He receiv-
ed his law degree from W&L and a
master’s degree from George
Washington University.

“Washington and Lee is grateful to
the Donner Foundation for its
generous gift in honor of Tatum
Smith,’ said President John D.
Wilson. ‘‘Mr. Smith was a devoted
son of Washington and Lee. I am sure
he would take great pride in this
memorial.”

End of the world

The Washington and Lee Film
Society is pleased to announce the
presentation of The Sacrifice
(Sweden/USSR, 1986), directed by
Andrei Tarkovsky.

Screenings will be at 8:00 p.m.
on Friday, January 8, and Satur-
day, January 9, in Classroom ‘“‘A”’
in Lewis Hall. There is no charge

for admission. The film is in
Swedish, with English subtitles

In The Sacrifice We are
presented with the kind of hero
that has always interested direc-
tor Tarkovsky—a person under
moral or ethical pressure, al a
crisis that will either make him or
break him. Here, a man beset by
self-doubt trades his own life for
that of a world doomed by nuclear
annihilation.

This rich and complex parable
of the end of the world and
redemption was the exiled
Tarkovsky’s greatest artistic ac-
complishment, completed shortly
before his death one year ago. The
work is a wonder of stately nar-
rative and memorable imagery.
Superlative acting and beautifully
stark cinematography by Sven
Nykvist help to make The Sacrifice
a truly haunting film.

The W&L Film Society is very
proud to be able to present The
Sacrifice, and we hope you will
share our invitation with students
and friends.

Act important

Open tryouts for W&L’s winter
theatre production of ‘‘Six
Characters in Search of an
Author” by Luigi Pirandello will
be held on Friday, Jan. 8, at 3 and
7 p.m. in the theatre. The play is a
philosophic comedy based on the
conflict which arises when a
theatre company is confronted
during a rehersal by 6
“characters’’ looking for someone
to put them into a play. There are
parts for 9 men and 6 women; 1
boy and 1 girl. Production dates
are Feb. 5-10. Scripts are
available for perusal at the
theatre box office.

Invitational this weekend

 

By Mike Shady

The W&L basketball team is much
like a classroom textbook: You have
to use it once in awhile or it will
gather a lot of dust.

The Generals, after a 27-day period
of inactivity, brushed off any
cobwebs that might have ac-
cumulated enroute to posting an 82-68
win over Buffalo St. Tuesday night in
the Warner Center.

“No, it wasn’t pretty,”’ said head
coach Verne Canfield, whose team
ran its record to 7-1, “but it wasn’t
surprising because we were tired.
You have to understand that we have
had an extremely long layoff.”

Canfield’s team was definitely no
beauty in the first 15 minutes of the
game. The Generals looked rusty and
slow, and Buffalo St. turned it into a
20-17 lead with hust over five minutes
left before intermission. But then
W&L got its legs back and blitzed the
Bengals for 12 straight points to take
a comfortable 29-20 halftime lead.

The Generals were led by the im-
pressive inside play of senior center
Harmon Harden, who scored 15 of his
game-high 22 points in the first half.
Harden was also impressive on the
defensive end, holding the three
centers for Buffalo St. to a combined
total of 15 points while denying
several passes into the post position.

Harden’s sudden emergence as an
inside force has been, to say the
least, a pleasant surprise. After
averaging 5.0 and 3.3 points per game
as a sophomore and junior respec-
tively, Harden is now averaging 15.3
a game.

“IT haven’t done any extensive
practicing on any one particular area
of my game,” said Harden. ‘The
main thing is that this is the first time

 

I’ve had the ball consistently passed
to me. It’s mainly because of the
guards. They have more confidence
in me and, as a result, I have more
confidence in myself.”

The nine-point lead was extended
to 13, 53-40, at the 10:15 mark of the
second half on a three-point shot by
freshman guard Mike Holton. The
Bengals, however, hung tough and
put together an 8-1 spurt that cut the
lead to six with just over eight
minutes remaining.

W&L answered with an 11-2 run,
capped off by another Holton three-
pointer and a no-look feed from
Holton to freshman forward Ed Hart
for a layup. That made the lead 15
and Canfield began clearing his
bench a couple minutes later.

Hart was the other big scorer for
the Generals, knocking in 18 points to
go along with his team-leading 11 re-
bounds. Senior guard Steve Hancock
contributed 10 points, while Holton
and junior guard Emmanuel Klump
added nine apiece.

The Generals play host in the W&L

HOOKSHOTS—Canfield was pleased
with the crowd turnout for Tuesday’s

The death of ‘‘Pistol’’ Pete Maravich is certainly a tragic event,

even more so for the true basketball fan. Maravich was a great
shooter, a creative passer and, most importantly, an electrifying
entertainer. Fans who saw Maravich play saw one of the best players
; to ever play the game and, more often then not, the ‘Pistol’, usually
made one play that wouldn’t let them forget that fact. But this column
is not about Maravich.

Maravich was white and, in the basketball world, this made him
even more popular. Racism is still very evident in today’s society (if
you don’t believe that then you are fooling yourself) and this racism is
what causes a phenomenon in basketball that we will call ‘“‘reverse
tokenism.”’

' Blacks are better basketball players than whites. This is a debatable
statement but I think history and the current state of basketball sup-
port it quite well. Accepting the superiority of blacks on the basketball
‘ court is difficult for white fans (I’m speaking generally here). Whites
still consider themselves to be superior human beings to blacks. As a

 

result, the media (which are predominantly white) tend to build up the
talents of the few whites that are good basketball players.

This issue came up during last year’s NBA playoffs when Dennis
Rodman and Isiah Thomas (who are black) of the Detroit Pistons
were quoted as saying that Larry Bird (who is white) of the Boston
Celtics wasn’t all that great a player. They continued by saying that
Bird was overrated and that,if he were black, he would be just another
“‘good’’ basketball player. Thomas would say later that he was joking

Reverse tokenism: Racism is

(Part one of a two-part series)

when he made the statement, but his joke brings up an interesting
question: Are good white players made better by a prejudiced media
and prejudiced fans because these same media and fans are worried
by the dominance of blacks in basketball? Or more simply: Are the
Larry Birds of basketball a product of reverse tokenism?

Take this example and chew on it for awhile. A few years ago, Chris
Mullin of St. Johns was named college basketball’s Player-of-the-
Year. It just so happened that an intimidating, dominating and future
NBA Hall-of-Fame center named Patrick Ewing was finishing up a
great career for Georgetown. Did Mullin win the award because he
was white? Of course he did. Mullin, for all his great ac-
complishments, is not in the same class as Ewing. He never will be.
But that’s the point. The media and public were hungry for a white
star. When they found him, he was suddenly raised from the plateau of
“good”’ on the talent mountain to the heights of ‘“‘great.”’

This is not to say that whites can’t play basketball. In my opinion,
Bird is the greatest and most complete ‘“‘player’’ (take note Abdul-
Jabbar and Chamberlain fans) to ever play the game up to this point in
time. Michael Jordan will have a lot to say about who’s the best ever
after he gets 10 years under his belt. Maravich was a great
player. So was Rick Barry, Jerry West, Bob Cousy and Bill Walton.
Looking at the current situation, I think Keven McHale of the Celtics is
an unstoppable force in the NBA and one of its best forwards.

But the reverse tokenism exists. Here’s another example. In
Playboy’s pre-season All-American picks, Eric Leckner of Wyoming
(a good white center) and Rony Seikaly of Syracuse (another good
white center) were selected over J.R. Reid of North Carolina.
Granted, Playboy is not exactly the gospel when it comes to college
hoops, but even this magazine should be able to see that Reid is far and
away the best center in the nation. And how about the case of Rex-
Chapman of Kentucky? Chapman has been touted by several ‘ex
perts’’ as being an All-American. Puuhlease. | can name four guards
(David Rivers of Notre Dame, Vernon Maxwell of Florida, Gary
Grant of Michigan and Hersey Hawkins of Bradley) that
outclass Chapman is EVERY single aspect of the game. Let's face it.
Chapman is not that good. He forces bad shots, is not a great passer,

becomes impatient when he doesn’t score early and he gets most of his
20 points per game shooting free throws down the stretch (he is a good
free-throw shooter). He’s not even that great a shooter from the out-
side (he should take lessons from Rivers in this department).

But he’s white. He can jump out of the building. He can slam dunk
like a black player. Chapman’s so-called greatness is a product of the
reverse tokenism phenomenon. And this phenomenon is not just
limited to the realm of basketball. Gerry Cooney of recent boxing
fame was the white racist’s dream. Finally, whites would have so-
meone who could allay their fears by beating up a black man. What
they all failed to realize was that Cooney had no chance. The skills and
talent were not there. He was overmatched against Larry Holmes in
his first title fight and he was overmatched against Michael Spinks in
his second. But he was white and for a brief fleeting moment he had an
opportunity to make a white mark in a black-dominated sport.

The reverse tokenism phenomenon is something that needs to be
done away with. Let’s judge players soley on their ability to play the
game, not on ability and the color of their skin. It’s a shame when a

player like Jeff Grayer (a great black player) at Iowa State doesn’t
receive the recognition he deserves. Let’s stop fooling ourselves.

NEXT WEEK: Stereotypes in football and baseball

NOTES—Auburn head coach Pat Dye had no business calling for a
field goal in the final seconds to tie (notice the rhyme with Dye)
Syracuse. He cheated the fans, the media and, worst of all, the players
on both sides of the field. Winners go for the win. Losers go for not los-
ing... I don’t know about you, but I was sickened by the display (or lack
thereof) of sportsmanship in the Orange Bowl. Celebrating a good play
is one thing, but pointing, pushing and getting in the opponent’s face,
especially after every play, is another...

The Ring-tum Phi, January 7, 1988

 

 

By Gary McCullough
Movie Critic

 

For most avid movie-goers,
Christmas break was probably a
time to emerge from the shell of
Lexington into the real world of
film. While this holiday season
brought us a few disappointments,
there were at least two titans at
the theatres that will be well
remembered when the Academy
Awards come around.

Oliver Stone directed Wall
Street, Which stars Charlie Sheen
as an ambitious young  stock-
broker who, with great per.
sistence, is able to bring in one of
New York’s wealthiest corporate
hoarders, played by Michael
Douglas, as a client. Sheen gets
the ball rolling with Douglas by
leaking some information on Blue
Star Airlines that he receives
from his father, who is played by
none other than his father Martin
Sheen. Daryl Hannah, whose re-
cent movies include Splash, Legal
Kagles, and Roxanne, becomes
romantically involved with
Charlie Sheen while maintaining
her secret relationship with
Michael Douglas.

 

Wall Street seems to be a fairly
accurate portrayal of the transac
tions that can occur within the
stock market, as it stresses the
progressive idea that “greed
pays.’ The film shows us that *‘in-
side informaton” obtained illegal
ly is indeed a part of Wall Street
today, but while small-scale tran-
sactions may go unnoticed, the
major takeovers usually will not

This is Michael Douglas's se-
cond leading role this year.Fatal
{ttraction, his earlier film, cer-
tainly shocked the nation with a
cold touch of reality, and Wall
Street has a similar effect on a less
startling scale. Both movies
should find nominations for the
Academy Awards, and Michael
Douglas, needless to say, will be a
candidate for Best Actor in either
film.

Douglas’s two most recent hits
prior to 1987 wereRemancing the
Stone and its sequel Jewel of the
Vile, which he also produced. Ina
recent interview, he confessed
that he has always been hesitant
about going after the really
serious roles for fear that he
might be seen as merely an imita-
tion of his father. Kirk Douglas is
known for many powerful roles in

Wall St. & Broadcast News

Tough Guys. Michael's role in
Fatal Attraction really turned
things around for him.

Another top candidate for Best
Film will be Broadcast News. This
film, directed by James Brooks,
stars William Hurt as a snarp-
looking and not-so-bright
gentleman whose only possible
career could be, of course, that of
a television network anchorman.
The film also stars Holly Hunter,
ofRaising 1irizona, aS a producer
and Albert Brooks, of Lost in
imerica, aS a reporter.

All three characters are very
well-developed, and the plot
thickens around their close rela-
tionships.

This is the first time I have seen
a movie and known, within the
first 10 minutes, that I could not be
satisfied with any ending it had to
offer. A confusion exists @n the
relationships of these characters
that lies almost completely within
the characters themselves, and
leaves little room for better sug-
gestions from the viewcr. After a
two-hour wait for the typical

“happy ending” found in most
love stories, I was very pleasantly
surprised to find no such thing.

After starring in such classic

are best

films as Eyewitness, tltered States,
and Body Heat, William Hurt has
received high praise from the
Academy. He was nominated for
Best Supporting Actor for The Big
Chill, won Best Actor forAiss of the
Spider Woman, and was robbed of
Best Actor for Children of a Lesser
God. Hurt has always been an ac-
tor who attracts movies with a lot
of class and will certainly be
recognized again for Broadcast
News.

Fatal Attraction, Wall Street,
andBroadcast News were three of
the very best films last year, and
provided us with something we
just don’t find enough of in the
theatre: a comforting sense of
reality (Fatal Attraction being less
comforting than the others). The
latter two, especially, provide no
frills in the end and seek no
beautiful solutions to unfortunate
circumstances in the world. These
films are real. While cute and fun-
ny movies such as Planes, Trains,
and Automobiles and Three Men
and a Baby have provided most of
us with great entertainment, such
delightful fantasies and perfect
love stories will find ‘‘no room in
the inn’’ at the Academy Award
ceremonies for 1987.

Eddie Murphy’s new film is so Raw

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

Eddie Murphy had quite a year in
1987. He was heralded as the top com-
edian in the nation, his summer hit

sequel ‘Beverly Hills Cop II” took
top honors as the highest grossing
movie of the year, and he finished the
year with a new concert film in the
theatres. Murphy had quite a year.
He should be thankful that he didn’t

start the year the way he ended it.

Murphy’s new concert film ‘“‘Raw”’
was one of the most highly an-
ticipated films released during the
Christmas season and by far the
most disappointing. Oh sure, all the
Murphy trademarks are there: the
tight leather outfit, the laugh, the
jokes about Italians, homosexuals,
and white people in general, and of
eourse the Cursefest style that is
synonomous with Murphy’s standup
(423 curses in 90 minutes - Yes I
counted!) but even they cannot save
this film.

“Raw” revives some of Murphy’s
most memorable characters but
even they can’t help. Murphy does
short impersonations of Mr. T, Bill
Cosby, a short Italian so charged
after seeing ‘Rocky IV” that he
challenges a 6’5’’ black man to a

fight, and a phone call with his drunk

father that are really quite funny.
Perhaps Murphy’s downfall comes in
not spending enough time with these
characters.

Murphy spends the bulk of “‘Raw”’
talking about love, his near mar-
riage, and how his girlfriend was go-
ing to take him to the cleaners in the
subsequent divorce. Some of this is
relatively funny, but it is far from
Murphy’s best work. Since Murphy’s
idea of love is strictly carnal the
routine becomes tiresome very
quickly and you start to count how
many times he can say the ‘‘F-word”’
in the span of one minute.

For those of you who think Eddie
Murphy is absolutely the funniest
man alive you might enjoy “Raw.”
The film is o.k. but compared to Mur-
phy’s last concert film “Delirious”
it’s not even close. I’m ony sorry that
Murphy didn’t make the entire film
as funny as the last fifteen minutes
where he impersonates his father
talking about when he was younger
and the family had to wear and eat
toys because Eddie’s grandfather
worked at the Coleco toy factory and
they were too poor to afford clothes
and food. This section of the film is
priceless, but the rest is disappoin-
ting.
