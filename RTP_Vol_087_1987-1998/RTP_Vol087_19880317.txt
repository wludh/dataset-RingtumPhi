The run-off election for Secre-
tary of the Executive Committee
continued to be a close race be-
tween Alston Parker and Edward
Yu, but Yu captured the position
with 52 percent of the vote. Turn-
out for Thursday’s election,
however, decreased to 56 percent
of the student body from the 67
percent turnout in the first election
on March 7.

Anticipating the upcoming year,

Yu says he plans to attend several
EC meetings this spring to become
more familiar with his responsibili-
ties. He said he will also work with
Mark Chiappara, present EC se-
cretary, rather closely to facilitate
a smoother transition.

In addition to the usual secretar-
ial duties, Yu said one of his main
goals will be to assist the President
and Vice-President in fulfilling
their responsibilities. Moreover,
he said he foresees that possible
proposals from the White Book
Revision Committee will create
additional work.°

1988 Mock Convention set to begin;
Young to deliver Keynote Address

From Staff Reports

 

The 19th W&L Mock Democratic
Convention will take place Friday and
Saturday, March 25 & 26 in the War-
ner Center.

The convention event will feature a
keynote address by Atlanta Mayor and
former U.S. Representative to the
United Nations Andrew Young. Other
highlights will include speeches by

Virginia Governor Gerald Baliles and’

former Governor Chuck Robb, as
well as Arkansas Governor William
Clinton, and a parade through down-
town Lexington, in addition to the
nomination of presidential and vice-
presidential candidates.

Nearly 200 students have been
working for more than two years
planning the event, which will get
under way Friday, March 25 at 10
a.m. with the traditional Mock Con-
vention parade through downtown
Lexington.

Each of the 54 state delegations has
built a float for the parade. The parade
will assemble at Brewbaker Field at

Yu edges Parker for EC Secretary

Although Parker did not win the
election, she said she thinks she
was successful. Said Parker, **be-
cause I got so close to winning with
only 48 votes difference says some-
thing about the fact that attitudes
toward women are changing at
W&L.”

In successfully reaching students
who formerly had anti-coed senti-
ments, Parker has been encouraged
to run as a Senior Representative.
Although she was not elected Se-
cretary, she said she would still
like to serve the university as a rep-
resentative.

By Jon Ryan
Staff Reporter

 

 

The W&L chapter of Amnesty
International is doing well, according
to organizer Kevin McNamara.

The group held its fourth meeting
and second letter writing session
Tuesday night.

According to McNamara, turnout
for the meetings is around 80 people,
both students, faculty, and townspeo-
ple. Generally, he said, 40 to 50 write
letters.

The group is open to everyone who
wishes to join. McNamara said letters
have been written to local churches to
try to garner support from the town.

Local support, he said, is necessary
to continue the letter writing campaign
over the summer.

McNamara said letters are sent out
in response to urgent action notices

Is the White Book too regulated?
Should the Honor Code include beha-
viors other than those concerned with
lying, cheating, and stealing? Should
the bad-standing clause be changed?
And how do you impress upon the in-
coming freshman the tradition of the
Honor Code?

These questions are just a few of the
topics debated at the Wednesday,
March 9 Honor Forum held by mem-
bers of the Honor Book Revisions
Committee, faculty members, includ-
ing registrar Scott Dittman, members
of the Executive Committee, especial-

ly President Brad Root, Law School

White Book Revisions Committee asks for student input

methods of contact with the committee
are through suggestion boxes in the
co-op, undergraduate library, and
ARA lounge at the Law School.

Although attendance was low, the
debate was strong with many topics
covered. The three main procedural
topics discussed were the bad-standing
clause, the time allotted to prepare a
defense, and the handling of the jury
decision.

There was much criticism for the
clause which penalized those students
who appealed their case to an open
trial by placing the message ‘‘not in
good standing’ on the transcript of
those found guilty, while those stu
dents who withdrew after being found
guilty in the closed hearing conducted
by EC were punished merely by
having ‘‘good standing’’ whited off
the transcript.

Law advocates, those law students
who prepare the defense for the ac
cused, wanted to change the wording
of the procedure for determining the
time the accused was granted for his
defense. Law advocates at the meeting
claimed that 48 hours was not always
sufficient to locate witnesses and pre-
pare for the defense.

Root said that the clause protected
the witness from having to ‘‘sweat it
out,’” and that he always extended the
preparation time when there was a
need.

Questions concerning whether jury
members should be allowed to take

notes during the open trials, should
they receive written instructions, and
should the *4 vote be changed to a
% vote were also debated. Arguments
against the jury members being al-
lowed to take notes included the opin-
ion that note taking distracted the
juror from absorbing all the informa-
tion presented.

Greg Dale, a member of the Honor
Committee and former juror, com-
mented that ‘it would have been nice
to have the charge written down be-
cause we forgot what the charge was
exactly.’ Furthermore, he felt that a
*A vote was “‘insufficient to determine
guilt.”’

The forum discussed the philo-
sophical question of whether or not to
turn the White Book into a rule book
of specific don’ts or to keep the Honor
System as it is—a personal honor code
that is simply defined by the command
“‘do not lie, cheat or steal.”’

**People when they come here are
not all going to have the same philo-
sophical views,’’ cautioned Tom
Reems. :

Also in response, Hugh Finkelstein,
next year’s EC vice- president, argued
that “honor is not purely academic.
You can’t turn it on and off.”’

Falk agreed, ‘‘If date rape occurs at
home, it’s still dishonorable. *’

The question of whether or not di
shonorable conduct such as date rape
should be handled by the EC or con

tained with the conduct committee

was also considered.

Dittman expressed concern that stu-
dents felt that ‘the honor system says
do not lie, cheat, or steal, and as long
as we avoid contact with these things,
we're safe from the honor system. As
long as we avoid anything that
‘smacks’ of that, then we're being
honorable.’

Root pointed out that the honor
book itself states that ‘“‘The Honor
System is not intended to govern
minor infractions of the University’s
or society’s regulations, but only acts
that indicate a student is not worthy of
trust by his or her peers.”’

He said that statement is ‘‘what
makes our honor system unique, cher-
ished, and the best tradition. ’’ He con-
tinued further to say ‘‘I feel confident
that we [the EC] are able to determine
what is dishonorable and not worth
trust.”’

Many more views and rules were
questioned, and the Revisions Com-
mittee welcomes all opinions. They
encourage students to contact them
and express their ideas about our
Honor System.

The committee members are: John
Falk and Richard Tomkins, co-chairs;
Greg Dale; Thomas Sheehan; Jeff
Burton; John Touchton; John Wil-
liamson; Shawn Copeland; Tom
Reems; Margaret Pimblett; Chuck
Murray; Mike Hassinger; and Scott
McArrow. They meet every Monday
at8 p.m

Clinton will open the second session,
beginning at 7 p.m.

Robb is currently Chairman of the
Democratic Leadership Council and
was extremely instrumental in the
formation of the ‘‘Super Tuesday”
primary elections. Clinton was first
elected governor of Arkansas in 1979,
and has served in that office contin-
uously since 1983. He is a member of
the Democratic National Committee,
and in 1987 was Chairman of the
National Governor’s Association.

Clinton’s address will precede the
platform debate Friday evening. A
Mock Convention committee, chaired
by Paul Miles, a sophomore from
Montgomery, Ala., has prepared a
platform report similar to the one
which the Democrats will debate at
their July convention in Atlanta.

Mock Convention delegates will
debate and vote on various planks of
the platform, which will be a combina-
tion of Democratic stances and W&L
student opinion.

The final session, at which the
nominees will be chosen, will get

under way at 9 a.m. Saturday.

Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young will
deliver the keynote address that morn-
ing. Young, who served as U.N. am-
bassador under Jimmy Carter, has
been major of Atlanta since 1982. He
is credited with much of Atlanta’s un
precedented economic growth and de-
velopment during that time. The selec-
tion of Atlanta as the site of the 1988
Democratic National Convention is a
recognition of Atlanta's significant
progress under Young’s administra-
tion.

Following Young's speech, the ac-
tual nominating process will begin.
The student delegates will attempt, by
roll-call voting, to accurately predict
the presidential and vice-presidential
nominees that will be chosen by the
Democrats in Atlanta this summer.

The final session is expected to end
in the early afternoon.

The 1,679 delegates include stu-
dents from W&L’s undergraduate and
law schools, as well as from some of

Two students organize

Contra Aid

discussion

held in Lee Chapel

By Andy Nixon
Staff Reporter

 

As the debate over Contra Aid con-
tinues on Capitol Hill, a forum held
last Thursday in Lee Chapel also dis-
cussed the issue of funding the Con-
tras.

The discussion was organized by
two W&L students, junior Bob
Tompkins and first year law student
John Falk.

Tompkins said he was ‘‘pleased
with the outcome of the panel discus-
sion.”

The panel consisted of four profes-
sors from different departments.

The four panelists were Associate
Professor of Law William Geimer,
Professor of History at VMI Blair
Turner, Assistant Professor of History
J. David Parker, and Professor of
Economics Bruce Herrick. Loren
Craner, a legislative assistant to Sen.
John McCain (R-Ariz.) was scheduled
to participate, but was unable to at-
tend. Steve Hammond, a law student
at W&L and an active in the U.S.
Marine Corps moderated the panel.

Although the panel unanimously
opposed aid to the Contras, the variety
of perspectives offered by the pane-
lists provided several sides to the Con-
tra Aid issue.

Said Tompkins, ‘“‘We could have
gone with a balanced panel and sacri-
ficed the knowledge the four panelists
had, but we decided to go with the
people who knew the most.”

Geimer began the discussion with
observations from the time he spent in
Nicaragua. Based on his experience in
the country Geimer said ‘‘the Contras
kill civilians.’ He went on to oppose
several popular arguments in favor of
Contra Aid such as: ‘‘Nicaraguans
will be better in the long run,”’ and
that ‘‘ Nicaragua is a threat to Browns-
ville, Texas.””

Geimer then quoted Webster's de
finition of arrogance and said, ‘*Web-
ster could not have better defined
United States foreign policy for the
last 150 years.”’

Turner spoke next and introduced
the historical relationship between Ni-
caragua and the U.S. into the discus-
sion. Turner discussed the military
presence the U.S. has had in the coun-
try. and its support and installation of
the Samosa regime.

He reviewed how August Sandino,
from which comes the name Sandin-
ista, and his followers came to power.

Turner’s main thrust against Contra
aid stemmed from the cultural ties
which developed between Nicaragua
and the U.S., and a belief that nations
have a certain right to ‘‘self- de-
termination.”

Parker continued the ‘‘self-
determination theme’’ and said that
when dealing with the Sandinista
government the ‘United States should
do business with them.”

Parker said, ‘‘The United States
wants responsible, stable, _ self-
respecting governments which are not
communist.’’ He added, ‘‘the odds of
the United States opposing a Marxist
government in Central America are
100 percent,’’ and that ‘‘this forces
these nations to militarize imme-
diately.”

According Parker, U.S. opposition
to communism has had nominal suc-
cess in Central America and another
policy ought to be considered.

Herrick spoke next on serious prob-
lems in the Nicaraguan economy.
Herrick said the U.S. should ‘‘send
massive jolts of foreign aid to the cur-
rent government,”

All four panelists opposed U.S.
intervention against the Sandinistas
and said the U.S. ought to operate
with the current government.

The panel did not decide whether
the Arias Peace Plan, or other
measures, could help the violent re-
gion, but agreed any plan which halted
aid to the Contras would improve the
situation greatly.

Tompkins said he thought ‘‘the
knowledge [the panelists] shared will
help people in a further evaluation of
the situation in Nicaragua.”

The discussion was taped and will
be broadcast on Cable Channel 9 in
the near future.

How to become an evangelist, according to Sbar

 

MY VIEW
By John Sbar

 

My recent five day absence from the
campus caused a state of euphoria
among students, administrators,
professors and Lexington politicians
who want to beautify the city. But,
like all euphorias it had to end some
time.

I didn’t transfer, I wasn’t expelled,
and I stayed out of jail. Actually, I
was attending a very important sem-
inar for aspiring evangelists, and for
the sake of the W&L community, I
will cover the important themes.

To become a God-certified evange-
list one only has to follow three simple
rules,

Rule 1: Participate in a sordid sex-
ual encounter.

Rule 2: Deny involvement in the
sordid sexual encounter on the 6 0’-
clock news.

Rule 3: After the police videotape of

 

 

 

 

more

the sordid sexual encounter is shown
on the 6 o'clock news, confess and ask
God's forgiveness.

Jimmy Swaggart did a fine job with
rules two and three but he had a little
trouble with rule one. He paid a pros-
titute to perform some sort of specta-
tor-stimulating activity which is bad
because rule one specifically says,
‘Participate in a sordid sexual en-
counter.’’ It does not say, ‘“Watch
someone perform a sordid sexual ac-
tion.’’ Obviously Swaggart needs to
do an internship with Jimmy Baker
who participated in enough sordid
sexual encounters to start his own
soap opera. Baker even invented rule
‘2: Be driven to sordid sexual encoun-
ter by a wife who buys mascara in fer-
tilizer bags.

Although Swaggart violated rule
one, his activities did benefit the
scientific community. The winner of
next years Nobel Prize in Science will
answer this biophysical question:
‘*What were the spectator stimulating
activities Swaggart paid to see?

Important news flash: unidentified
sources (George Bush) have identified

. \/ This sni Pee is

une Pik, im.

two major components used by ‘the
prostitute Swaggart hired to perform.
The mysterious Spectator Stimulating
Activity—a pogo stick and a nerf foot-
ball.

Another evangelist is doing some-
thing even more disgusting than Baker
in order to satisfy rule one—he’s run-
ning for president. The readers who
don’t think running for president is
sordid and sexual enough to satisfy
rule one had never heard of Gary Hart
either. The most tragic aspect of the
evangelist who is running for presi-
dent, besides the fact that we have to
hear his speeches, is that he isa W&L
alumnus.

I apologize to the readers who were
never told that Republican candidate
and famous evangelist Pat Robertson
was educated at W&L. (Important
fact: this is the first true statement I
have ever written). It’s an outrage but
it’s true. The administration has engi-
neered a full scale Pat Robertson
cover-up. Here’s how the cover up

works.

Student: Dean Ogolthrope, does
WA&L have any famous alumni?

Dean Ogolthrope: Boy, where have
you been?! We have more famous
alumnus than the Honor Code has vio-
lations. Haven't you heard about the
four best-selling writers or the six su-
preme court justices or the eighteen
senators or the twenty magazine edi-
tors Or...

Student: Is it true that a famous
evangelist and presidential candidate
went here?

Dean O: Let me get back to you on
that, my teeth need immediate floss-
ing.

Before you chastise the administra-
tion for covering up Robertson’s
alumni status, consider the conse-
quences of the nation knowing the
truth.

Melvin Doital: (high school senior
from Wisconsin—genius and star ath-
lete). Well Mom and Dad, I've
reached a decision, I’m turning down

that full scholarship from Harvard to
go to W&L. Academically W&L is as
strong as any Ivy League school and
it’s a heck of a lot more fun. Harvard
doesn’t have Fancy Dress, Mock
Convention and six fraternities for
every 100 students; not to mention...

Mr. Doital: Excuse me for raining
on your parade Melvin, but did you
know that Pat Robertson went to
W&L?

Melvin: You mean the evangelist
running for president?
Dr. Doital: That's the one.

Like all scholar athletes, Melvin has
a vivid imagination and starts envi-
sioning himself at W&L. Instead of
wild parties he sees Bible study from
6:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.; classes from
noon until 6:00 p.m.; more Bible
study from 6:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m.
and lights out at midnight.

Melvin: I hear Boston is a great
city.

The cover up was working fine until
Robertson’s campaign got to South
Carolina. The Washington Post re-
cently quoted Robertson during a
speech explaining his Southern

lineage, ‘‘I'm the only [candidate] ;

who went to college where Robert E.
Lee was president.’’

Robert had many interesting things »

to say in this speech. For example, he

accused Republican rival George Bush |
of engineering the Swaggart incident »

to hurt Robertson’s campaign. When
reporters asked him for evidence he

replied that he had no evidence but '

feels that it is true. He sounds like the

Attorney General Edwin Meese, who |
has no evidence but feels that porno- '
graphy causes all sexually-related .

crimes. You should use this logic with

your professors, ‘‘I have no evidence *

as to why I deserve an ‘‘A’’ in your
class but I feel like I should get one.”’

LETTERS |

Alumnus writes about W&L and date rape

The Student Body, Faculty, and Alumni:

For the past two years I have chaired a state-
wide, United Methodist task force on child sexual
abuse. In the course of our investigation, the issue
of date rape came up. While peripheral to the task
force’s concerns, the subject caused me, as an
alumnus of W&L, some belated feelings of guilt.
Hence this letter.

I graduated from W&L in 1973 after four years
of work, fun, and learning. Having attended all
male schools since I was thirteen, I decided to re-
verse that personal trend and enrolled in the gra-
duate program at Hollins College.

Hollins proved an enlightening experience. For
the first time in my life women were more than
just occupants of a distant and alluring world, they
became my every day companions and, in many
cases, close friends. As friends will, some of my
fellow students at Hollins began to confide in me.
What they had to say sometimes surprised and
saddened me.

When I attended W&L, dates were drawn from
the women’s colleges surrounding the area. It
seemed some benevolent god had ordained that all
such colleges would be placed just close enough to
allow us to pick up our companions on a Friday
afternoon, but far enough away to preclude our re-
turning them after a long night of carousing. And

so we took them home to our apartments for the

night. :

The student body of W&L in those years pre-
sented the world with a unique image for a college
community: there was the atmosphere of relaxed
social mores and experimentation common to
most university campuses in the late sixties and
early seventies, but at W&L this atmosphere was
tempered by the ethical standards of General
Lee’s honor code. Honesty was everything. Hon-
esty in our incessant political discussions, honesty
in our friendships, honesty in Southeast Asia,
honesty in our faculty, and honesty in our love
lives. If one wished to make love with a woman,
one was honest about it (we probably would have
said ‘‘up front’’ about it) and she, in turn, was ex-

pected to be honest about her desires. If none

were present (and believe me, I sadly but quickly
discovered this to be my usual lot), well, that was

‘‘cool,’’ we’d just sack out on opposite sides of
the bed and in the morning, gentlemen that we

were, we would drive them back to Sweet Briar,
Randolph-Macon, Hollins, or wherever.
It was understood that just because circumstan-

ces made it easier for your date to sleep over did

not necessarily mean you would engage in sexual

intercourse with said date. We were young and
idealistic and more than willing to put out ideals
into practice in this way. It was the corrupt society
of our parents’ generation that said a man couldn’t
occupy the same bed with a woman without forc-
ing himself upon her. We were different. We

were actively creating a better world.

Or at least I had thought we were until I began
attending classes at Hollins. The women at Hol-
lins taught me many wonderful things, but they

also taught me some rather sad facts about reality.
They taught me there were W&L students whose
concept of honor was terribly flawed, students
who might adhere religiously to the code as re-
gards academics or personal property, but refused
to sustain their commitment to honorable behavior
when they had a female in their bedroom. I met
women at Hollins who had been raped by W&L
students.

The fact that these rapes had, for the most part,

all occurred in beds, beds which the women had
willingly entered, meant of course their victims

wouldn’t have stood a chance in a court of law.

But that doesn’t make them any less rapes, thefts
of these women’s dignity and, in many cases, the

psychological well-being.

We were taught that as W&L students were ex-
pected to live up to a higher ideal than the merely

legal expectations society places upon its mem-
bers. We were to neither lie, cheat,

law. We were to behave at all times as gentlemen.
And a gentleman didn’t do such things. Ever,

This high standard for behavior was and is a gift
W&L gives its students. Those of us who are now
alumni continue to try to live up to this ideal in a
society that frequently labels such concepts old-
fashioned and out-of-step. Though we may some-
times be considered naive, the honor code has gi-
ven us a sense of who we are and what we stand
for that is sorely lacking in today’s materialistic
world. Such a code should not be sullied by a few
dolts who would use their greater size and the ab-
sence of any legal restraints to steal from a woman

one of her most basic possessions: her sense of

physical security.

When I learned of these rapes I was young and
inexperienced, As a graduate of W&L I apolo-
gized on behalf of my alma mater for such beha-

nor
steal...regardless of whether or not we could be
held accountable for such actions in a court of

vior. It never occurred to me I might do more.
Then, years later, came my service on the task
force. When date rape was discussed I re-
membered those long ago conversations and I
resolved to write this letter. Probably it is years
late. Probably the school has long since developed
a program to teach incoming male freshmen all
the ramifications of being a gentleman. But just in
case it hasn’t, I hereby recommend such instruc-
tion.

At my freshman orientation in the fall of 1969 a
significant portion of the schedule was devoted to
the honor code. Hours were spent discussing the
intricacies of what did and did not constitute a vio-
lation. And yet I don’t remember a single mention
being made of a W&L gentleman’s responsibili-
ties toward that favorite preoccupation of all
W&L men since the days of Liberty Hall: women.

But you had better believe we talked about them
back in our rooms at night. I remember one fellow
explaining to a group of us credulous freshmen
that all women ‘‘wanted it’’ and, when they said
“*no,’’ they really meant ‘‘yes.’’ I would love to
claim I saw through such claptrap, but I’m afraid I
didn’t. I was confused. At seventeen years of age
women were still quite a mystery to me and, as a
result, I just didn’t know. Thankfully I never ac-
ted upon such advice, but clearly some of my
peers did. i

Fourteen years ago I received my master’s de-
gree from Hollins and moved on. I, have long
since forgotten the names of the women who
shared with me that they had been raped. Nor
could I now say how many women told me of such
an experience. I can with certainty however say it
was more than one. Let’s be conservative and say
it was only two women. Assuming I became close
to twenty women at Hollins during my year there
and then making the additional assumption that fu-
lly half of these would have chosen to share such
an intimate detail with me had they ever been
raped, this means that out of a sample of ten
women who could have shared such an experience
with me had it occurred, one-fifth of them did.
While I’m sure this is far from being a valid statis-
tical sample, it scares the daylights out of me
nevertheless.

We can’t do anything for those women, but we
can for today’s, including those wonderful new
W&L women. If we don’t have a required pro-
gram for incoming freshmen on sexual ethics,
let’s start one. If a statement hasn’t been made to
the effect that it is an honor code violation to rape
a woman, let’s make that statement and let’s make
it now. It is W&L’s heritage, its ability to produce
whole, caring, and intelligent human beings, that
we will protect thereby.

Women support frats

To the Editor:

In response to the recent rush revision propo-
sals, we, a segment of the female student body,
would like to encourage the administration to re-
address their motives and goals for the revision. A
supposed complaint and reason for the change in
the rush process has been that the women claim to
be neglected in the fraternity system and unsatis-
fied with its abilities to provide them with a suita-
ble social outlet.

Contrary to the administration’s beliefs, there
exists a large number of women not only satisfied
with the fraternity system, but quite happy with it
and would even appreciate the administration
restoring it with its previous privileges and inde-
pendence of past years.

The destruction of one of W&L’s strongest tra-
ditions would not provide many women with a
more enjoyable way of life. A better solution
would be for the administration to quit focusing its
spring cleaning on the fraternity system, and in-
stead address the creation of possible new social
groups that would meet the needs of students ex-
pressing discontent. The fraternity system offers a
necessary social outlet. Perhaps the administra-
tion is not taking into account the fact that Lexing-
ton, Virginia offers no social outlets for any stu-
dent under the age of twenty- one.

One of W&L’s greatest attractions over col-
leges comparable in educational reputation is its
healthy mix of social activity with academic con-
cern. When the faculty of W&L attempts to inflate
academia by deflating the social scene, it is, in
fact, altering the delicate balance and age-old
image of W&L that has been drawing students
from all over for years. In order to continue
W&L’s unique superiority, it must conform to
and retain some of the vital traditions familiar to
both the alumni and the present student body. A

reconstruction of the school’s social system can
not possibly generate anything but resentment
from recent alumni and disappointment from cur-
rent students. Let’s be honest, academically
speaking this school is nothing less than rigorous,
and a place to blow off steam is essential.

We hope our outlook will be seriously reviewed
and sincerely considered by the administration.
Admittedly, we do not represent the entire female
population.on campus but neither do those who
oppose the fraternity system.

Thank you for your consideration,

Diskette clarification

Dear Editor:
I am writing in response:to'the disgruntled stu-
dent in last week’s issue of The Ring-tum Phi who

lost his diskette. In his letter, the student commen-
ted on the Computer Center’s so-called policy of
lost diskettes. According to this student, when the
Computer Center assistants find a diskette in a
computer lab around campus, they either confis-
cate the diskette after a week and recycle it or they
throw it away. The actual policy of the Computer
Center with diskettes found in the labs is to leave
them there on one of the tables for the people to
claim. Many of the labs, such as Newcomb,
Payne and the library, have had diskettes lying
around for an entire term without the Computer
Center taking them.

Besides making incorrect generalizations about

the policies of the Computer Center, this student
expects the computer lab assistants to pick up after
him. The Computer Center has much more impor-
tant things to do then following people around,
like this student, and reminding them they have
misplaced their diskettes. This student should be
grateful to attend a University where an abun-
dance of micro-computers are available to use.
The least he can do is keep track of his valuable
diskette or even better make a back-up of his pre-
cious documents.

In conclusion, this student’s problem should not
be addressed to the Computer Center, but rather
to the students who use the micro-computer labs
so often. I know many people don’t own the new,
expensive and smaller diskettes and if they see a
diskette lying around the lab, many would use it to
print out their documents. What happens after
that, lies in the hands of the Executive Committee
and not in those of the Computer Center.

A political FD

Micro-Computer Assistant

To the Editors:

I came back to W&L for Fancy Dress full of
grand expectations. When I arrived, however, I
found that Fancy Dress has become nothing more
than a political battleground. Our grand tradition
stretching back eighty-one years has been tarni-
shed by controversy. What really is the con-
troversy? I think there is none. A Civil War theme
stressing the rebuilding and healing of America,
should not be offensive. This is an important part
of our heritage, showing that Americans can work
in harmony for the common good.

I think there is something, however, that fueled
this political fracas. It seems that at W&L, it is
fashionable for the Civil War to be ongoing.
WAKE UP, YOU POOR DELUDED PEOPLE,

would stop trying to live in the past, I think W&L
would be a better place. To consciously reenact
the Civil War is stupid. Reenactment occurs in
theatre, not normal society. We should learn from
the past, now wallow in it.

On a parting note, why did the MSA students
protest this theme? To be consistent, they should
boycott every possible theme that can be based on
American history. I doubt the MSA students
would do it. They just chose this event, this
theme, to make a political statement on campus.
Let’s keep Fancy Dress out of the political strug-
gles that divide students. Let it be simple...our
party...a good time for all.

Sniper shoots at police officers

their car was believed to have been

cording to Bruce M. Beard, Lexing-
ton’s chief of police.

the new Rush proposals were being
considered.

‘*The faculty sees rush and pledging
as affecting academic life on cam-
pus,”’ and because ‘‘the trustees have
delegated authority to the faculty for
student life on campus’’ there arises a
need to review rush, said John.

The faculty delegated the power to
review Rush to the Student Affairs
Committee. The faculty can remove
that power, but, for now, the power
remains with the ten members of
SAC.

John also mentioned a petition with

West Washington Street, the front

from a .300-caliber magnum in the
street in the area where the car was

116 faculty signatures. He said it
reads, in part, there is an ‘‘academic

advantage to deferring rush until the

winter term.””

The proposals themselves differ as

to when formal Rush will occur.

The first option has rush running
from September 9 through September
18, with ten rush dates, ten open

houses, and several invitation parties.

The second option, on the other
hand, has an informal rush starting on
September 17 and running through the
26th. This will be followed on Oc-

Experts are sent to verify reports of

According to McNamara, they
” double and triple check the facts be-
+ fore reporting back to the Denver of-
fice.
Once the Denver office receives
* word, he said, it wires the notices al-
most immediately.
Generally, McNamara said, the let-
_« ters are just of couple of paragraphs
, addressed to prison wardens or heads
of state to let them know people real-

 

ize what is happening.

Amnesty International’s letter writ-
ing campaign is only part of what the
organization does. According to
McNamara, it also tries to educate.

**Amnesty is here to educate you,
not brainwash you,”’ he said.

The biggest controversy facing the
W&L chapter of Amnesty Interna-

sctional:is:the U.S. death penalty, said
McNamara. The organiZzation’s meet-
ing two weeks ago examined the death
penalty, and it was a heated discus-
sion.

According to McNamara, he is try-
ing to move the group away from the
death penalty issue right now, to let it
stabilize.

‘*People have a gut reaction [about
the death penalty]; they think it’s
right.’’

Amnesty International opposes the
death penalty, but individuals are free
to pick and choose what topics they

will write on.

**You don’t necessarily have to
agree with Amnesty on the death pen-
alty to support it on other issues,”’
said McNamara.

The group is looking for help, both
in manpower and in donations to pay
for envelopes and stamps.

McNamara appeared before the
Executive Committee several weeks
ago to request funding. His request

was denied because the EC was hesi-

tant to fund so controversial a group

with student tax money.

McNamara initially did most of the
work to start the group and keep it
rolling, but as he says,‘‘It’s a group
effort, not an individual thing.

“One person can write maybe 10

letters, but 10 people can write 100.”
He repeated a quote from a prisoner
who was released after torture:
“It’s the accumulated weight of the
feathers that sinks the boat.”’

forces were called in, and several
streets were blocked off from the pub-
lic for approximately two hours.

Approximately two dozen officers
gathered around the bullet shell as it
was collected as evidence.

Kutz refused to talk about the inci-
dent until the investigation is over.

The police department requests that
anyone who believes he has informa-
tion about the Saturday morning inci-
dent call the police at 463-2112.

The actual formal rush will begin in
the first week in January. Pledging
will occur at that time, and would last
eight weeks for all fraternities.

The chief debate, however,
centered around the minimum GPA
necessary to initiate into a fraternity.

In both proposals a 1.9 GPA would
be required for initiation.

The discussion centered on the
difference between the minimum
fraternity GPA and the 1.5 GPA es-
tablished by the university for aca-
demic probation.

Blacks to join faculty

 

By Alice Harrell
Staff Reporter

 

There will be three black professors
among the new faculty members com-
ing to W&L next year.

Anne Wortham will be an assistant
professor of Sociology. After graduat-
ing from Tuskegee College she went
on to earn her Ph.D. at Boston Col-
lege. A former journalist, she wrote
for numerous publications, including
Esquire magazine, and also worked on
the Huntley-Brinkley report in 1967-
169.

Wortham was an assistant professor
at Wellesley College in 1982, then she
spent the following four years at the
Kennedy School of Government at
Harvard University, where she was an
assistant professor of Public Policy.
She is currently a visiting scholar at
the Hoover Institution at Stanford
University, where she is developing a
book on intellectuals on policy mak-
ing.

‘‘She was our number one candi-
date,’’ stated Professor David No-
vack, when asked about the selection
of the right person to fill this position.
“Fortunately she felt positive about
us,”” he added.

fended the higher GPA. He said he
wanted to see the ‘fraternities lead the
way” in improving grades.

He said the requirement could be
used by fraternities to defend them-
selves against parents who feel their
son’s poor GPA is a result of too much
fraternity and not enough studying.

Several members of the audience
defended fraternities and said that
through study halls and motivation by
brothers fraternities do emphasize
academic performance as one of their
goals.

IFC President Mark Farley,

Wortham was selected out of ap
proximately 120-130 original appli
cants for the position, according to
Novack. The committee has been re
viewing applications since December

Joyce MacDonald will be on th
W&L English staff for the 1988-89
school year. MacDonald is currently
finishing work at Vanderbilt on het
Ph.D. in English Literature, with a
specialty in Shakespeare.

According to Dean John Elrod,
MacDonald will be working here as
an ‘ABD Fellow,’’ ABD standing for
** All But Dissertation.’’ People under
this program spend a major portion of
their time, aside from teaching, writ
ing their dissertation.

A third professor, Benjamin Dais,
will be at W&L during Winter Tern:
Dais will be a temporary faculty
member under the Visiting Black
Professor program.

With the exception of a black Ac
counting professor who taught in the
Commerce School a few years back
these will be the only black professors
to teach in the undergraduate division
of W&L. Of these three, Wortham is
the only professor to be signed on for
a tenure position; MacDonald and
Dais will have temporary positions.

however, countered by saying,
‘*fraternities do not always act re
sponsibly.”* He cited the ‘‘record
number of freshmen admitted
Stonewall Jackson Hospital in one
evening’’ during Rush as an example
of fraternity’s ‘‘responsibility.”*

At the end of the meeting an infor
mal poll was taken.

No one favored the first option and
the rest of the votes were divided
evenly between the second option and
“none of the above.”’

The IFC, however, voted unani
mously for the first option.

W&L debate team takes
Great Britain by storm

 

By Eleanor Nelson
Staff Reporter

 

Rather than spend their February
break in Cancun, New Orleans, or
Colorado, sophomores Donald DeFa-
bio and Damon Fensterman travelled
to England to represent W&L in
several debates.

The two students sent several
resolutions to schools in England to
propose various debate topics. The
University of London, Southampton
University, Durham University, and
Leedes University replied that their
debate teams would accept the stu-
dents.

At the University of London and
Durham University, DeFabio and
Fensterman prepared to challenge the
resolution that America is a debau-
ched society. At both schools they op-
posed the statement and won.

At Southampton University they
supported the resolution that govern-
ment should be for the people, not by
the people. Though not victorious on
this resolution, the two thought they
had done well despite the loss.

The team prepared for the debates
by researching their topics, thinking
them over, and writing theoretical
speeches. They rely on bouncing ideas
around with each other as they pre-
pare; an allowance for spontaneity to
respond at the actual debate is also
part of debating.

The British style of debating is quite

different from the American. Au-
dience participation is allowed and en-
couraged; questions may be asked at
any point during the speeches, even by
the other team.

This style puts a greater emphasis
on one’s speaking abilities, rather than
focusing on one’s research abilities as
in the U.S. Speaking to an audience
who will decide the victor is quite
different from speaking to a judge.
The students prefer the British system
because they think it prepares one as a
better speaker, which is the ultimate
goal of debating.

The debate team at W&L has an
exchange program with British
schools every year. The teams alter-
nate with the W&L traveling one year,
the British team visiting America the
next.

DeFabio and Fensterman noted a
greater interest in debating among
British students compared to Ameri-
can students. After many of the de-
bates in England, the students would
get together over dinner or drinks and
continue discussions. Fensterman
thought they were less afraid to be in-
tellectually aggressive in challenging
each other on current issues than typi-
cal American students.

In retrospect both students thought
the trip was a great success and an im-
pressive experience. Not only debat-
ing at the several campuses but travell-
ing throughout England made the trip
an enjoyable way to spend February
Break.

Baseball splits |.

irst 4 games &

 

By Gary McCullough
Staff Reporter

 

After the first week of the season,
the W&L baseball team is at an even
.500. The Generals captured two wins
out of a three game series last week-
end against the NAIA West Virginia
Tech team on Smith Field. W&L then
lost to Bridgewater on the road in its
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
opener on Tuesday afternoon.

On Friday against West Virginia
Tech the team looked pretty sharp.
Senior Carter Steuart was the Gen-
eral’s starting pitcher, picking up the
win as junior Mike Temple came on in
relief and got the save. After the Gen-
erals posted a 6-1 lead, Tech made a
valiant comeback that just fell short as
W&L stayed on top for an 8-6 win.

Things were just as close between
the two teams on Saturday afternoon.
Senior Eric Acra started off the pitch-
ing this time with sophomore David
Smith and Temple coming in for re-
lief. The game wasn’t decided until
the final inning, but Tech pulled out a
9-8 victory. The Generals had two

men on and two outs in the bottom of
the seventh inning, but first-year law
student Hugh Finkelstein struck out to
end the game.

W&L then bounced back with jun-
ior Chris Cunningham on the mound
to get a 5-3 victory in the second game
of the doubleheader. Junior Dave Hol-
land got the save for the Generals.

The story was not as pleasant from
the Tuesday trip to Bridgewater. The
Generals lost a deceivingly close 7-0
game to the Eagle with Steuart on the
mound and Temple in for relief.

‘It was a really close game,”’ said
head coach Jeff Stickley.
‘‘{Bridgewater] got the hits all at one
time and we just didn’t. That was the
biggest difference.’’ Bridgewater
scored on two-run and three-run
homers. Outside of that, it was a very
solid game for the Generals defen-
sively.

Offensively, W&L was a little off
from its weekend production. ‘‘We
need to score more when we get the
chance,” said Stickley. Although the
lost opportunities did not help the
Generals on the scoreboard, they did
make the game a lot closer than the

Men’s tennis chalks up two more victories

By Stuart Sheldon
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee men’s
tennis team continued its winning
ways this past week with victories
over two Division If Pennsylvania
schools, Slippery Rock State College
and Bloomsburg University. With the
two wins the Generals’ record climbs
to 4-2.

Last Thursday the Generals played
host to Slippery Rock State College,
coached by Jim McFarland. The Gen-
erals had no problem handling the
Rockets, winning 8-1.

In singles action, W&L’s No. 1
player, junior Robert Haley, beat
Mike Karijanian 6-1, _6-3.,The Gen-
erals’ No, 2 man, junior Bobby Matt-
hews, handled Johnathan Donado in
even finer fashion, 6-1, 6-0, and No.
3, senior David McLeod, blanked
Slippery Rock’s Scott Jackson 6-0,
6-0.

At No. 4, senior Chris Wiman ran
into trouble against the Rocket’s Jere
Woodyard, dropping the first set 3-6.

Wiman rallied in the second set,
however, forcing Woodyard into a tie-
breaker. After a fervent battle, Wiman
lost out on the sixth tie-breaker, giv-
ing Woodyard the match, 3-6, 7-6 (6).

W&L’s No. 5 man, freshman Bill
Meadows, had little trouble with his
opponent, Drew Dearborn, winning in
straight sets, 6-1, 6-1. Moving up to
the No. 6 position for the match
against Slippery Rock was sophomore
Matt Ormiston, who also blanked his
opponent, Bob Starr, 6-0, 6-0.

After a short break, the teams met
again in doubles competition, W&L
swept the pairs with the team of Matt-
hews/McLeod winning 6-1, 6-3 and
Haley/Meadows combining for a 6-2,
6-4 win. i.

Although it-appeared as if all three
doubles matches ‘were going
smoothly, the No. 3 tandem of Ormis-
ton and freshman Reid Manley ended
up having to battle hard for the win.
The pair won the first set convinc-
ingly, 6-0, but the Rockets managed
to rally to win the second set 6-1. Or-
miston and Manley settled down to

Lax defeats Hornets,
gives O-W tough test

The W&L lacrosse team is only
.500 overall, just as it was last week at
this time, but the Generals have come
a long way in two games, proving to
themselves and their fans that they can
compete with the best in Division III.

W&L scored eight goals in 17
minutes to tie the defending national
runners-up Saturday before losing to
Ohio Wesleyan in the final minutes.

Then, in case there were any
doubts, the Generals added an excla-
mation mark Wednesday by winning
their second Old Dominion Athletic
Conference game, defeating Lynch-
burg College 9-5 in a game W&L
dominated throughout.

True, a loss is a loss, whether the
score is 24-5 or 11-9, but W&L’s two-
point defeat Saturday wasn’t anything
like the beating the Generals suffered
in their only other loss this season.

In fact, if there is such a thing as a
positive loss, this was it.

For the second time in as many
games, the Generals started slowly,
this time allowing seven goals before
they even got off a shot. But W&L
stormed back with five straight goals
and went on to tie the game twice be-
fore the Battling Bishops were able to
nail down the win.

‘That game proves we can compete
with anyone in Division III,’’ said
head coach Dennis Daly. *‘We should
go into the rest of the season with a
certain amount of confidence, know-
ing we have what it takes to win.”

Bishop attackman Rob Alvino star-
ted the scoring less than two minutes
into the game, and the all-American
scored three more times before W&L
freshman midfielder Clark Wight put
the Generals on the scoreboard 11
minutes into the second quarter.

Wight’s first goal as a collegian
made the score 7-1 and started a major
swing in momentum. After an O-W
timeout, the Generals won the faceoff
and quickly set up a goal by senior
Robbie Stanton that cut the margin to
five.

Less than two minutes later, W&L
sophomore attacker Chris Giblin re-
corded his first goal of the day to
make the score 7-3 at halftime

The W&L swing continued in the
second half, as sophomore midfielder
Chris Mastrogiovanni scored on a
pass from Stanton two minutes into
the third quarter.

The Generals capped their five-goal
run with an extra-man goal by Stanton
four minutes later, making the score
7-5. O-W’s Charlie Blanchard broke
the W&L scoring streak at the eight-
minute mark to put the Bishops up by
three, but senior attacker Peter Smith
answered for the Generals less than
thirty seconds later.

A Mastrogiovanni goal with 5:50
left in the third quarter pulled W&L to
within one, and, three minutes later,
senior midfielder Sandy Harrison’s
first goal of the day tied the game for
the first time since it began.

In the final quarter, the Bishops re-
gained the lead on a goal by attacker
Dan Hannan, but the Generals re-tied
the score at nine when sophomore at-
tacker Patrick Gochar scored with five
minutes left.

The Bishops shut out the Generals
the rest of the way, however, scoring
twice during the final four minutes to
nail down their second victory of the
season.

In the Lynchburg game it was the
Generals who took the early lead, and
W&L coasted to a four-goal victory.

On an ice-cold afternoon, Smith and
junior John Ware combined for five
goals in the first half as W&L shut out
the Hornets in the first two periods.

The Generals were in command all
day long, taking more than twice as
many shots as the Hornets (47-20) and
controlling the ground balls (62-36).

Although the Hornets won the sec-
ond half 5-4, the W&L win was never
really in doubt.

The game was plagued by 17 penal-
ties. Surprisingly, W&L failed to
score on nine extra-man opportuni-
ties, while the Hornets recorded three
of their five goals on power plays.

‘*We won, but we won ugly,””
Daly.

Ware led all scorers with four goals,
and Smith scored three times. Harr-
ison, Giblin and Gochar each record-
ed one goal.

Looking ahead, W&L begins a
four-game home stand against Gettys-
burg at 2 p.m. Saturday and plays host
to Bowdoin College a week later

said

business in the third set and squelched
the Rockets 6-3.

On Friday the Generals faced
Bloomsburg University, coached by
Burton Reese. Bloomsburg, ranked
ninth nationally in the D-II polls, had
travelled to Lexington from Char-
lottesville. Bloomsburg had dropped a
close decision there to the University
of Virginia, 5-4, on Thursday. W&L
faced tough competition from
Bloomsburg, and the action was fierce
in the hot afternoon sun.

The two teams played doubles first,
and the Generals won two of the three
matches.

W&L’s McLeod and Matthews beat
Roly Lamy and Lance Milner in
straight sets, 6-3, 6-2. The combina-
tion of Wiman and sophomore John
Morris needed an’ éxtra ‘game to win
the first'‘set from Mark Billone and
Marc Lupinacci 7-5, and closed out
the match with a more convincing
second set, 6-2.

Haley and Meadows could not piece
together a win, however, against Matt
Quigley and Dave Gilbert. The
Bloomsburg pair took the match in

straight sets, 6-3, 6-2.

Going into the singles action, the
Generals knew it would be close, and
it was.

Haley dropped his match to Mark
Billone at No. | by a score of 5-7, 3-6.
“T played well, but I didn’t win the
big points,”’ said Haley, who remains
confident despite the loss. ‘‘I was
happy with the way I was hitting the
ball.”’

He went on to say that the tough
games being played now will allow
the Generals to be on top of their game
in May, when W&L hosts the NCAA
D-III Men’s Tennis Championships
for the second time in four years.

‘*These early matches are great for us
going into Division III Nationals.”’

Matthews, consistent to form, han-
dled Bloomsburg’s No. 2 player,
Lamy, quickly, winning 6-1, 6-1.
McLeod, playing again at No. 3 for
W&L, beat Milner 6-4, 6-4.

Back again in his No. 4 position for
the Generals, Morris had his work cut
out for him against Bloomsburg’s

Mare Ludinacci. Morris had to wait
until the sixth tie-breaker point in the
first set to win it 7-6 (6). Ludinacci at-
tempted to rally in the second set, but
Morris slammed the door, winning 6-
3.

At No. 5, Chris Wiman also had his
hands full early. Facing Matt Quigley,
Wiman came back after losing the first
set 5-7, to win the match 5-7, 6-1,
6-4. No. 6 Meadows also needed three
sets to beat Dave Gilbert 3-6, 6-3,
6-4. Final team score: Generals 6,
Bloomsburg 3.

The Generals continue to tune their
game for the Swarthmore/Washington
College matches on March 26 by play-
ing five teams this week.

W&L will play Millersville today at
3 p.m. and Virginia Tech on Saturday
at 2 p.m., both here in Lexington.
Sunday the Generals travel south to
North Carolina to play Davidson (1
p.m.) and return to Lexington to play
Lynchburg College on Monday (3
p.m.) and the University of North
Carolina at Greensboro on Tuesday,
again at 3 p.m.

Linksters dig hole in finishing 20th

Sports Editor

 

Last weekend’s James Madison In-
vitational tournament was not exactly
the way the W&L golf team wanted to
kick off its 1988 season.

The Generals dug themselves into a
hole on the first day, but regrouped on
the second day to finish in 20th place
out of 23 teams.

‘*We're not pleased with the way
we finished,’’ said head coach Buck
Leslie. ‘We did, however, play better
on the second day and beat three

teams.'’ The Generals were tied for
last place after the first round of play.

W&L was led by senior Gary
Campbell,
163. Junior Tom Wingfield shot a re-
spectable 170 in his first college tour-
nament. As a team, the Generals shot
337 the first day and 334 the second
for a total of 671. East Tennessee
State won the tournament with a score
of 590,

‘*We hit the ball pretty well,”’ said
Leslie. ‘‘It was one of those times
when you hit the ball well, but you
can’t score. And scoring is the name
of the game.”

The team especially had difficulty
on the two trouble holes on both the
front and back nine of the golf course.
One General suffered a 10 while a few
others scored 8. **We got hurt there,”’
said Leslie.

Lynchburg

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

 

 

Despite extreme cold and high
winds, the W&L women’s tennis team
breezed by Old Dominion Athletic

Conference rival Lynchburg 7-2 at

home in its opening match of the
season.

Freshmen Jean Stroman and Kathy
Leake, ranked numbers one and three
in team singles respectively, finished
off their opponents in two sets—6-2,
6-2 and 6-4, 6-0. Numbers two and
four, freshman Kelly Martone and
junior Martha Christian won their
matches in the third set. Martone’s
score was 6-2, 3-6, 7- 5, and Chris-
tian’s ended in a tie-breaker 6-3, 7-6,
7-6.

W&L’s No. 5. singles player,
freshman Shawn Wert, lost 2-6, 6-2.
2-6. Junior Benny Savage, playing
No. 6, shut out her opponent 6-0, 6-0.
The Generals won two of the three
matches played in the doubles compe-
tition.

The team was missing its usual No.
4 singles player, sophomore Theresa
Southard, because of illness. This
caused the Generals to shuffle their
lineup a bit, moving Christian to four
and having Savage play at number six.

Head coach William Washburn had
no definite expectations, but he was
pleased with the outcome since
Lynchburg is an experienced and
senior-dominated team.

Today, W&L plays Southern Sem-
inary in an exhibition match at home
on the lower courts. The Generals’
next official matches are Friday
against Longwood and Monday
against Wellesley, both in Lexington.
The team travels to Bridgewater for an
ODAC match with the Eagles on
Tuesday before returning to take on
Roanoke on Wednesday.

From Staff Reports

 

W&L had three individual ath-
letes perform at NCAA champion-
ships last week.

The W&L women’s swim team
was represented by junior Eli-
zabeth Miles and freshman Sharon
Coleman at the NCAA champion-
ships held in Atlanta on March
10-12.

Miles broke the school and
ODAC record by finishing 18th in
the 1,650 yard freestyle in a time
of 18:08.06 (She had a school and
ODAC record during her
1,000-yard  split-10:55.69). She
also swam the 500-yard free (23rd,
5:17.09) and the 200-yard free
(24th, 2:00.39).

Coleman broke the school and
ODAC record in the 100-yard but-
terfly when she finished 29th with
a time of 1:01.46. She also swam
the 200-yard fly (20th, 2:14.27).

Although neither swimmer ear-
ned all-American honors nor
scored any team points, head coach
Page Remillard was proud of the
way both swimmers performed.
‘*They are happy with their swims,
but disappointed that they didn’t
score any team points. They are
committed to scoring those points
next year,”’ he said.

Sophomore pole vaulter Phillip
Sampson also competed in the
NCAA championships. He fin-
ished 8th at the NCAA Indoor
championships held at Smith Col-
lege in Northampton, Ma. when he

World Jazz great
Marsalis plays Chapel

 

Irom Staff Reports

 

Renowned jazz pianist Ellis Marsa-
lis will perform with his trio on Wed-
nesday, March 23 at 8:00 p.m. at Lee
Chapel. There is no charge for W&L
undergraduate and law students, be-
cause of the substantial support from
the University to the Rockbridge Con-

ert- Theatre Series.

The name Marsalis is in the fore-
front of today’s music. Wynton and
Branford Marsalis are top recording
irtists and award winning musicians.
Younger brothers are in the wings.
But it all goes back to their father.

‘Ellis Marsalis, Jr. has a list of cre-
dentials no less remarkable than those
of his celebrated sons,’ according to
an extensive article in the Los Angeles
limes.

From his early days as pianist with
the Al Hirt Band to his present posi-
tion as Coordinator of Jazz Studies at
Virginia Commonwealth University,
Marsalis has studied, performed and
taught the diverse aspects of jazz. ‘‘l
was a jazz player from day one’, he
proudly claims.

Born in New Orleans, with exten-
sive piano and clarinet training, he
also studied the cello, recieved a
Bachelor of Arts degree in Music Ed-
ucation from Dillard University and
later a Masters degree of Music Edu-
cation from Loyola University.

Marsalis has led a double life as per-
former and teacher. He has performed
extensively in New Orleans, while
teaching high school and college mu-
sic courses and maintaining a stable

family life with his wife, Dolores, and
their six sons. Over the years, he has
performed nationally and internation-
ally and recorded a number of albums.

From 1974 to 1986, Marsalis was
an instrumental music instructor at the
well-known New Orleans Center for
the Creative Arts. It was there that the
new generation of jazz musicians were
developing. Wynton and Branford
Marsalis, as well as Terence Blan-
chard, Donald Harrison and Kent Jor-
dan, all regarded as ‘‘wunderkinder”’
or prodigies, were schooled by Ellis
Marsalis.

At the present time, Marsalis is a
Commonwealth Professor in the Mu-
sic Department at Virginia Common-
wealth University in Richmond,
where he states that, ‘‘I have found a
supportive administration in an envir-
onment that encourages experi-
mentation. With this opportunity I
hope to fulfill a long awaited dream of
helping to bring to the mainstream of
American education America’s only
contribution to world culture—Jazz.”’

Among his many affiliations, he is
also on the Academic Council of the
Thelonious Monk Center for Jazz
Studies in Washington, D.C., which
was founded and sponsored by the
Beethoven Society to help foster the
serious study of jazz.

Marsalis will perform at Lee Chapel
with reeds player Victor Goines, bas-
sist Delbert Felix and percussionist
Clarence Penn. The program will con-
tain some of Marsalis’ own composi-
tions as well as those of other com-
posers including Duke Ellington, The-
lonious Monk and Charlie Parker.
