Young says
convention
is important

The mayor of Atlanta called the
Mock Convention an important event
leading to the national Convention this
summer in his keynote address at the
final session of the convention Satur-
day.

“*T see this as a prophetic conven-
tion,’ said Young, ‘‘helping the
nation and party determine the next
candidate and formulate opinions that
makes him the next candidate.”’

Young said the election process was
*‘serious business.’’

“If business is not growing it can’t
give leadership,’’ he said.

The collection of candidates for this
year’s Democratic presidential nomi-
nee is the finest he’s seen in years,
Young said.

Stressing what he views as Republi-
can mistakes, Young outlined ways in
which the Democrats need to work
with the presidency «

‘‘Nothing happens for good unless
we as a nation are involved in it,’’
Young said.

When the Republicans in 1973
abandoned Democratic policies that
had been in effect since World War II,
Young said, they were abandoning a
policy that had revitalized the nation,
as well as helped the recovery of
Europe and Japan.

Young cited the formation of OPEC
and the subsequent rise of oil prices as
well as the current economic situation,
including the current budget and trade
deficits. He said the Republicans have
taken protection away from American
taxpayers, ‘‘the same protection that

 

former Virginia Gov. Charles Robb
and W&L professor of history J.D.
Futch, who placed second in the vot-
ing.

When the convention was adjourned
around 1:30 p.m., Dukakis had not
yet been reached by Mock Convention
officials.

The session was called to order at
9:30 a.m., and the keynote address
was delivered by Atlanta Mayor An-
drew Young, who said afterward,
**The feeling you get...is very similar
to a real convention.”’

The W&L Mock Convention began
in 1908 when it correctly predicted the
presidential nomination of William
Jennings Bryan. Since then the con-
vention has established a well-known
success record in choosing the nomi-
nee of the political party not in the
White House at that time.

In the past nine conventions, the
students have only been wrong once.
In 1972 they chose Edward M. Ken-
nedy as the Democratic nominee in-
stead of George McGovern.

The convention has been called
“‘the biggest and boomingest’’ by
Time magazine, and ‘‘the most real-
istic’? by Newsweek magazine.

“It has served both parties well in
the past for 45 years or so,’’ said Vir-
ginia Gov. Gerald L. Baliles, who
gave greetings to the convention from
the state in the first session yesterday.

While Albert Gore may have es-
caped with the vice- presidential
nomination in last weekend’s Mock
Convention, there was a strong, if not
quite nationally known, candidate
who finished in second place.

‘Second place was disappointing,
but the honor of being nominated is
long overdue,’’ said Jefferson Davis
Futch, Il, professor of history at
WAL.

Futch was nominated for the vice-
presidential spot along with Arkansas
Goy. Bill Clinton, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson and University of Kentucky
basketball star Rex Chapman, among
others.

Of the man who defeated him in the
balloting, Gore, Futch said, ‘‘A major
league turkey, a gold medal, blue-
ribbon turkey.

*‘Nobody ever said I’m a good
loser,’’ he added.

What would his first action be if he
was vice-president of the United
States?

 

 

 

Futch misses nomination

‘*T would revert to Renaissance poli-
tics and I would arrange for the presi-
dent’s prompt poisoning.’’

And after assuming the presidency?

“I'd break relations with the evil
empire, abolish the income tax, disso-
lve the bureaucracy and go home to
Monticello.”

Futch also had observations on
other candidates for the presidency.

Dukakis: ‘‘I think he should go back
to Greece and become chairman of the
socialist party there.”’

Jackson: ‘‘I’m not going to get up at
6 a.m. to vote for him.”’

Bush: ‘‘A charming non-entity with
a wife with whom I wouldn’t want to
tangle.”’

Robertson: ‘‘I think the holy Pat is
God’s future viceroy on earth and he’s
a shoo-in in 1992.”’

The Democratic Party: ‘‘It’s not
publishable in a family newspaper--or
a kiddy newspaper.”’

Futch’s favorite Democrat is
‘‘Mario Cuomo’s mother, Immac-
ulata.’” Why?

‘*Because she loves capital punish-
ment and wants to fry everybody.’’

tax dollars bought our enemies after
World War II.’’

Young said that American strength
is of importance world-wide.

‘*Everybody in the world wants a
strong America,’’ he said. Even Rus-
sia wants a strong America as a deter-
rent for military radicals in their
system, he said.

‘‘The Japanese government could
not survive without America to
protect their markets and access to the
world,’’ he said.

‘It is not for them to decide what is

a strong America,’’ Young said.

Young called education the biggest
factor in a strong United States and
called for a renewed commitment to
providing education to all Americans
at prices they can afford.

Education is ‘‘the best investment
we can make as a nation,”’ he said.

Young said the investment would be
paid back not only in repayment of
loans but in the tax money and de-
velopment educated Americans would
contribute.

Student reaction is very positive

If the reputation of the Mock Con-
vention awed it’s participants it cer-
tainly didn’t show it in their actions.

Dax Cummings of the New Hamp-
shire delegation said he didn’t re-
member much of the Friday sessions
but said ‘‘he loved the parade. I loved
the way all the people of Lexington
looked at all of us. They loved us.

‘*The floats were great. I think we
should do it for homecoming; have all
the fraternities make floats. It would
be great,’ said Cummings.

Rick Silva, the State Chairman from
New Hampshire, agreed that the par-
ade was interesting and added, ‘‘[The
convention] is a hell of an event. I
wasn’t expecting half this much. The
committee went out of their way to
really make sure this is authentic.’’

Alcohol helped the loose atmos-
phere at the Convention. Fancy Dress
Ball may have been dry, but the Mock
Convention was most certainly not.

Esther Huffman, a delegate from
Washington, had a sign which read
‘‘Dukakis in ‘88’’ on the front and
‘‘Beam and Coke’’ on the back. She

said, ‘‘These are the things that we
support. That’s our entire platform.”’

Christian Bevington of the Georgia
Delegation said, ‘‘I think drinking is
definitely a main aspect of the whole
thing.”

Friday night's sessions featured
speakers from the National and Vir-
ginia State Democratic Party.

Ted Hart from Tennessee said,
‘*These people who are getting up and
speaking are gettin razzed pretty bad
by all the Republicans.”’

Wyatt Bassett, also of Tennessee,
agreed. ‘‘There are more Democrats
on the podium than there are in the
audience.”’

Saturday’s session was the nominat-
ing session.

Frank Watson of the Nevada dele-
gation thought Saturday’s session was
‘‘a little bit more calm and control-
led.?"

Stuart Sheldon of the Minnesota
Delegation also thought Saturday’s
session was a little more subdued.

He said, *‘The crowd is much less
unruly than last night and I think that’s
probably because they're pretty fa-
tigued from activities that probably
occurred after the convention last
night.

*‘Of the three sessions [Saturday] is
definitely the brass tacks of the con-
vention. I think everyone understands
that this is where all the action
occurs,”’ said Sheldon.

After the first ballot, when no can-
didate had enough delegates for nomi-
nation, the Convention had to go to a
second ballot to pick a winner.

Jon Solomon, State Chair for Flor-
ida thought the second ballot added
excitement and realism to the Conven-
tion.

He said, ‘‘I think [the second ballot]
is extremely realistic because we have
all the backroom playing I expect to
see this summer in Atlanta [at the ac-
tual Democratic Convention. }’’

Jim Sloat, New York State Chair,
agreed.

‘*As far as realism, yes, I think this
is it.

‘*The first ballot you have commit-
ted delegates, they’re going to have to
stay the way they are,’’ said Sloat.
‘The deal that’s going to be cut be-
fore the convention is going to reflect
what we are doing right now. So I
think a second ballot reflects exactly
what’s going to happen.”’

Class elections are held;
student turnout is ‘good’

By Wendy Wolford
Staff Reporter

The class elections on March 21
yielded few clear winners and set the
stage for the big run-off elections on
the 24th.

 

~ ers Giblin waselected junior.

class executive committee rep-
resentative with 50 percent of the
vote, while Willard Dumas captured
the sophomore EC position with 57
percent of the vote.

For the senior class EC
resentative run-off, the candidates had
been reduced from five to four compe-
titors. John McDonough and Alston
Parker were elected to the EC in the
run-off by 188 and 106 votes respec-
tively.

Fray McCormick defeated Jim Am-

brosini by 39 votes for senior class
president.

- Monday’s election eliminated three
competitors for senior class vice-
president, leaving Dana Bolden, S.
David Burns, Bill Crabill, Matthew
Bevin, Mike Carroll and Bobby Matt-
hews in the run-off election.

--e-Burns; Carroll,.and Matthews were

elected to the vice- presidential posi-
tions.

The run-off election for the second
junior class EC rep was between Judd
Parker and Thomas Sheehan. Parker
defeated Sheehan by seven votes.

The run-off election for junior
president was not as close, with Ri-
chard Zuber defeating Lee Fleming by
121 votes to 80.

vice- president's slot was captured by
Stephen White, 182 votes to 150.

Overall, turn out for the run-off
elections was rather good, especially
in thre freshman class. The total num-
ber of run-off ballots in the sopho-
more elections was 352. 205 sopho-
mores voted in the junior class run-
offs, while 272 ballots were tabulated
for the senior class elections.

Mock Convention brings
world’s media to Lexington

 

By Marie Dunne
Co-editor

 

Reporters came from as far away as
Denmark, Austria, and Japan to cover
the 1988 Mock Democratic Conven-
tion.

In all, more than 40 reporters repre-
senting newspapers, radio stations,
television affiliates and wire services
reported on the convention.

Many of the foreign journalists
came a day early to attend a seminar
entitled ‘‘The Race of ’88’’ sponsored
by the United States Information
Agency and the W&L Department of
Journalism. Susan Hedges from the
Saudi Press Agency said, at this point,
she is ‘‘not following the presidential
election closely.’’ She said because
she does plan to cover the national
convention, she attended the seminar
and Mock Convention in order to get
background information and to under-
stand the electoral process better.

Most of the foreign journalists
heard about the Mock Convention at
the Foreign Press Center in Washing-
ton D.C. According to Hedges, Mock
Convention Media Chairman Tim
Bolling and the USIA did ‘‘a very
good job of publicizing’’ the event.

Christen M. Schmidt of Denmark's
Politiken said the Mock Convention
‘‘is a great opportunity to learn about
the process without actually having to
work hard to follow the events and
also have a lot of fun.”’

According to Schmidt, the people of

Denmark are very interested in the
U.S. presidential election. ‘‘I think
it’s more important to us who’s the
president of the United States than
who’s the prime minister of Den-
mark,’’ said Schmidt.

Schmidt said that he will write a
small feature story on W&L’s Mock
Convention.

Lauren Silva-Pinto of the Austrian

Radio & TV said that she heard about
the convention through one of the
cameramen on her crew who is a
W&L alumnus, as well as through the
Foreign Press Center.

“We're going to do a five-minute
feature story about the Mock Conven-
tion,”’ said Silva-Pinto. The story will
be broadcast on Austria’s state-run
news organization, ORF, she said.

“‘It is interesting to add that ORF is
also seen in parts of Hungary, Cze-
choslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Poland,
so the Mock Convention will have a
greater exposure than what is norma-
lly expected in Europe, I think,’’ said
Silva-Pinto.

Silva-Pinto says that she knows the
American political system, particu-
larly the electorial process, can be
very confusing for Europeans and
thinks that ‘‘this feature that we are
going to do will allow the Austrians to
get a much better handle on how the
convention actually works.”’

Closer to home, most Virginia
newspapers, radio and _ television
stations carried coverage of the Mock
Convention.

Television stations in Richmond,
Charlottesville, Roanoke, Lynchburg,
Harrisonburg, and Washington D.C
sent crews to the convention. In addi
tion, Cable News Network carried a

story it received from WDBJ-TV in
Roanoke.
Radio stations from Lexington,

Staunton, and Richmond covered the
convention. Radio reporters from the
Virginia New Network and the Voice
of America were also at the conven
tion.

Newspapers from Toledo, Ohio,
Norfolk, Richmond and Roanoke sent
reporters. United Press International
and the Associated Press wire services
also carried stories on the event

Mary Ellin Arch, of United Press
International, said that UPI has been
following the progress of W&L’s

Mock Convention for months.

‘*We did a story when they forecast
the lowa caucus winner and when they
forecast the New Hampshire primary
winner. We also did a story on their
predictions for Super Tuesday. And
then when they were right 17 out of
the 20 races, we did another story on
that,’’ said Arch.

“*Everybody knows about this con-
vention,’ said Arch. UPI did both
news wire and broadcast stories, she
said.

Tana Castro of WVPT-TV, Virgin-
ia’s public television in Harrisonburg,
said that it will carry a ‘‘profile of the
whole convention’’ on its magazine
show Skyline Illustrated, as well as
carrying smaller stories on its news
programs.

The magazine segment will be be-
tween six and ten minutes, said Cas-
tro.

Castro said that she heard about the
event from alumni on her crew as
well.

‘You all have a fabulous public re
lations department down here, and we
get a lot of story ideas from them, but
also several employees of the station
attended W&L or attended one of the
schools near W&L,"* she said.

Mark Roberts of WDBJ-TV_ in
Roanoke said that he tried to cover the
issues behind the convention,

“We going to try to get some type
of perspective on this thing. Don’t just
throw it out and say ‘100 students at
W&L want Dukakis to be president.’
I’m going to try delve into some of the
issues such as this is a very conserva-
tive Republican campus, and yet they
base it on the party that’s not in
power. I think that’s kind of an inter-
esting twist,’* said Roberts

Lillian Clark of WANV-FM_ in
Staunton said that she was covering
primarily the speeches of Lt. Gov

OPINION

 

Obnoxious

Over all, the 1988 Mock Democratic Convention seems to have
been a success. Hopefully, after this summer’s real Democratic
Convention in Atlanta, we will know that it was also accurate. Re-
gardless of its success, however, there was a problem we would like

to point out.

Unfortunately, W&L students have the ability to be exceptionally
rude and obnoxious. During former Gov. Charles Robb’s speech,
the student audience was so loud it was extremely hard to hear, and
Robb had to stop to ask for the audience’s attention.

Later that Friday night the delegates engaged in such ou-
trageously obnoxious and offensive debating on the platform that
we will not even go into the specifics here. However, The Rich-
mond Times-Dispatch did use those specifics.

It’s a shame that when the eyes of the world are upon us, students
have to get so out of control they cast a bad light on the school.
Hopefully the next time W&L is at the center of attention, students
will have matured enough to participate rationally.

America’s betrayal

of freedom fighters

 

MY VIEW
By John Roach

 

The year is 1956 and the Hungarian
people rise up against the oppression
of the Soviet Union. The freedom-
fighters are urged to continue their
fight by the United States and are
promised U.S. support. The Hungar-
ians rid themselves of the Soviets only
to be betrayed by the U.S. when the
Soviets roll through their country a
short time after the successful revo-
lution. It takes only four more years
for the U.S. to betray another group of
patriotic freedom-fighters. As the
U.S. trained freedom-fighters landed
at the Bay of Pigs, in an attempt to
free their country from Castro, their
much needed and promised air sup-
port was reneged upon by President
Kennedy. The list of betrayals goes on
and on and last week’s events in Ni-
caragua close a chapter on the latest
U.S. betrayal of freedom- fighters in
their cause against the most evil em-
pire in our world today.

The cease-fire accords signed in Ni-
caragua last week between the Sandin-
ista Marxists and the Nicaraguan re-
sistance signify a shameful moment in
U.S. history. This cease-fire was for-
ced upon the freedom-fighters, for it
was their only alternative to slaughter.
When Congress cut off aid to the free-
dom-fighters last month the resistance
had no option but to accept a Vietnam
“‘peace with honor’’. It is indeed a
tragedy that the 10,000 freedom-
fighters were set adrift after such a
successful year in 1987. The resis-
tance last May had eliminated former
Somoza supporters, began operations
in over two-thirds of Nicaragua in
July, and through these successful
operations brought Daniel Ortega to
the bargaining table in October.

One shakes his head in bewilder-
ment over the liberals’ support of a
Soviet colony in Central America.
The freedom- fighters were bringing
the Sandinistas to their knees and the
liberals led by Jim Wright and Tony
Coehlo shattered the dreams of liberty
of the Nicaraguan people. Their cow-
ardly opposition to the aid package
offered by President Reagan led to the

cut-off of all aid at the end of Febru-
ary. Ortega and his junta of Commu-
nist thugs immediately began prepar-
ing for a deathblow to be dealt at the
resistance.

The Sandinistas’ recent incursion
into Honduras was this planned final
act to eliminate the fighters who wan-
ted a true people’s revolution. It
shows that the resistance was a threat
to Ortega, for he was willing to risk an
international outcry against his viola-
tion of the borders of Honduras to rid
the Sandinistas of the very serious
threat that the freedom-fighters posed.

It is amazing that anyone could ac-
tually trust Daniel Ortega in the way
the liberals do. He promises to follow
the Arias ‘‘peace plan’’ and makes
only token moves to loosen the chains
of bondage that are wrapped around
the people of Nicaragua. This is
enough for the liberals whose mantra
is,“‘let’s give peace a chance’’. This
dubious settlement has been achieved
at the cost of denying the Nicaraguan
people the rights that we consider in-
dispensable for ourselves. The press
has reported that peace has been
reached in Nicaragua and that Daniel
Ortega and the Communist clan have
promised many reforms. These re-
forms are pipe dreams in the same
way that the 1973 Paris Accord which
brought ‘‘peace’’ to Vietnam was a
pipe dream. That peace was brought,
but the price was high. We abandoned
an ally while he was gasping for
breath and the result was the consoli-
dation of Communism in Southeast
Asia and the near- genocide of the
people of this region. We have now
helped Ortega secure his power and
like all good Communists he will now
look to expand the tyrannical creed
that rules his life.

This expansion will be at the ex-
pense of the fragile democracies of
Central America and instead of the
Nicaraguan resistance’s holding the
line against Communism and creating
another democracy in Nicaragua, the
leaders of Central America will plead
for American boys to come to protect
them from the Ortega brothers. And if
these troops are sent let us never for-
get that their blood as well as the
blood of the Latin American people
whose lives will be lost in the fight
against Marxism will be on the hands
of Jim Wright and his liberal collea-

gues.

Give Fool’s Day the proper respect

 

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

America is currently faced with
many problems. At home, the deficit
is so big that if all the presidential
candidates donated their campaign
budgets to the government it would
take two presidential elections to elim-
inate. Foreign affairs don’t look much
better, with Nicaraguan communists
expected to take over Los Angeles by
the end of the week. Still there are
more important issues; issues which
demand immediate attack.

Perhaps the most critical issue is
holiday reform.

Midnight tonight marks the begin-
ning of a significant day in American
history, April Fools Day. It also
marks the continuation of an Ameri-
can tragedy, because otherwise-
patriotic citizens have been treating
the first of April with unwarranted in-
difference instead of deserved vener-
ation. As a holiday reformer, my first
responsibility is to help the reader de-
velop an appreciation for America’s
great holiday.

It all started on April 1, 1492, with
a young prankster and opium addict,
Christopher Columbus. Christopher
played a big prank on the king of
Spain. Using maps bought at a toy
store he fooled the king into believing
the world was round. Then he convin-
ced the king to give him 1000 gold
pieces, the queen, and his best ship in
order to find a placed called America.

Before Chris could tell him it was a
prank he was sailing away with a 1000
gold pieces, the queen, and a great
ship. As you know, Chris and his
crew of Zen Buddhist sailors actually
found a place named America. Of

course, the trip did have its tragic
moments. When food ran low the
crew was forced to violate the Zen
oath of vegetarianism by having the
queen for dinner.

(Important Note: Many first grade
teachers have been telling a different
story about Columbus and his dis-
covery of America. Anti-American
elementary school superintendents are
largely responsible for this distortion
of a historical event.)

Now that the reader has realized
America as we know it could not have
existed without April Fool’s Day, he
or she must now learn how to treat this
holiday with proper respect and dis-
tinction by becoming an expert prank-
ster. Of course, the only way to be-
come an expert prankster is to study
an expert prankster, such as myself, in
action.

The date is April 1, 1987. I have
just walked into the kitchen for break-
fast where my mother is innocently
reading the newspaper. You are about
to witness a flawless execution of
April Fool’s Day rule number one:
Have no mercy on gullible family
members. I sit down without a word
and peer sadly into my breakfast.

Mom: Jon, is everything okay?

Jon (bursting into tears): No! Yes-
terday we got the test results back
from the high school literacy test you
need to pass in order to graduate. I
failed.

Mom (very concerned): What hap-
pened, Jon. I mean, you’re no genius
but at least you can read.

Jon (after 10 minutes of lame ex-
cuses as to why I failed): Ha Ha Ha
Ha! April Fools!

As my mother contemplates why
she had me, I bask in sweet victory.
But like all experts I was already wait-
ing like a hungry tiger for my next vic-
tim. Then my twin sister Shannon
(nicknamed Gurb by me) walked into

the room. My sister is quite a socialite
and loves to party, which brings me to
rule two: Pick pranks which hurt the
victim the most. While Gurb reads the
comics I reflect on her love for par-
ties, which leads me to start some ca-
sual conversation.

Jon (matter of factly): Hey Gurb,
did you hear they just raised the drink-
ing age to thirty?

Gurb (in extreme anguish): But that
will ruin tonight's party.

Jon (after explaining to her why it
was raised for 20 minutes): Ha Ha Ha
Ha! April Fools!

Gurb and I soon arrive in home-
room where I have already planned
out the strategy for my next prank.
This brings up rule three: Get bitter
prank victims to help you carry out
pranks on friends. I sit down without
saying a word to my best friend, Paul,
and stare sullenly at the desk.

Gurb (whispering to Paul): Don’t
bother Jon, Washington and Lee just
found out about the time you two stole
that car. They just revoked his accep-
tance.

Paul (greatly concerned): No! We
didn’t mean to steal that car. It just
happened.

Gurb (makes him feel worse): My
Dad is throwing him out of the house.
Paul is overwhelmed with guilt when I
break out in tears (Note: crying is a
very helpful April Fool’s Day techni-
que).

Jon (after 10 minutes of muffled
sobs): Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha! April
Fools!

Using rule three again, Paul and I
fake a fist fight in physics. Even
though the dean gave us three days of
work detail it was worth it. This exhi-
bits rule four: Don’t hesitate to make a
sacrifice if it’s in the interest of a good

prank.
At this point I felt confident enough
to try a large-scale prank using rule

i

five: Manipulate current news events.
As I sit in English class I remember
that the Supreme Court has just ruled”
that surrogate mother Mary Beth
Whitehead could not keep the child, .
but must honor the contract she signed
and give the child to the paying father, ©
Dr. Stern. When the class quiets ’
down, I pick the right moment.

Jon: Mrs. Walker (English teacher)
do you have a radio? I just heard Mary *

Beth Whitehead committed suicide. °

We could probably hear it on the
news.

Mrs. Walker (the whole class is
stunned): No! Really?

Jon (after the class spends 10
minutes flipping radio channels): Ha
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha! April Fools!

Mrs. Walker: You just failed my |

class.

Unfortunately, most of my pranks *
were not fit to be published in a news-

paper. Let me remind you of a few

things though. Rule six: Be careful, «

pranks can backfire. Note what hap-

pened when I tried a prank on my gir)- ©

friend.
Jon: You know Honey, I think we’-

re getting too serious. Let’s break it |
off for a while. ‘

Girlfriend: (she has no sense of
humor): I’m so glad you said that. I’ve
been struggling for a way to tell you
the same thing.

Rule seven: Be realistic. Walking

up to a friend and saying, ‘‘Happy »
April Fools. By the way, I just set .

your car on fire,’’ won't fool anyone
unless your friend happens to be a
very gullible Spanish king from the
fifteenth century.

Finally there is rule eight: avoid go-
ing too far. Locking a friend in the
bathroom and throwing in a canister
of nerve gas is a prank you might
come to regret.

In closing, I urge you to do your
part for America and show your
patriotism! Wage prank warfare on

Fancy Dress and MSA boycott bring in alumni opinion

To the Editors:

I am boycotting Fancy Dress this year, too. The
theme of this year’s ball is in very bad taste in-
deed, considering the history of our University.
It’s really rather like the Germans holding a
; ‘Treaty of Versailles’’ party.

Seriously, though, I believe I understand the
Minority Student Association’s gripe. But I think
they’re letting emotion cloud reason in this case.
They object to the selection of a theme depicting
‘ta period in which blacks were oppressed.’’
Blacks have been oppressed, in one way or an-
other, from these States’ colonial beginnings until
very recent times. Can we not have F-D themes
relating to any period prior to Brown v. Board of
Education?

Surely one can celebrate some aspects of a
period without celebrating all. If the theme were
‘*Ancient Athens’’, who would suggest that we
were glorifying slavery? Yet Athenian ‘‘democra-
cy’’ relied on slavery every bit as much as the old
South. And nobody would suggest that, since the
majority of blacks in ancient Athens were most
likely to have been slaves, blacks could not parti-
cipate with dignity and good humor in the fes-
tivities.

Picking the end of the War Between the States
as a theme does not show ‘‘nothing other than bla-
tant disregard for [black people’s}] achiev-

 

ements.”’ It says nothing at all about black peo-
ple’s achievements, just as it says nothing about
Irish- American or Chinese-American people's
achievements.

Actually, that period was a very hopeful time
for blacks, until the Republican party showed that
it was more interested in using blacks to punish
the South and to establish a permanent Republican
ascendancy, than in actually improving the lives
of the people whose jobs (albeit oppressive jobs)
they had recently taken away.

Aren’t there worthier causes for the MSA to
commit its moral energy to? This ill-placed indig-
nation over such a trivial issue makes a valuable
and important part of the University community
seem picayune and petulant. I wish they'd lighten
up, go to the doggone party, and have a good
time. It’s their party, too.

Sincerely,
James D. Crutchfield, '87L

Delegating thanks

Dear Editor:

On behalf of Don Thayer and myself, I would
like to publicly thank the members of the New
York state delegation to the 1988 Mock Democra-

tic Convention. They formed the most spirited
and dedicated delegation in the Warner Center.
Their research and fund raising prior to the Con-
vention prepared us for our task. They also built a
great float and cheered louder than anyone else.
Thank you again for your great work!
Sincerely,
Jim Sloat

Thanks to all

To the Editors:

We would like to take this opportunity to thank
the students, faculty, and administration of Wash-
ington and Lee University for their support and
enthusiasm during the 1988 Mock Convention.
We could not have carried it off without the help
of literally everyone on campus, and we thank
you. In the face of much debate about apathy at
W&L, we were very proud to be responsible for
an activity in which over 80 percent of the student
body actively participated. Thanks again.

Civil War scholars
to study Jackson

oa

By Margaret M. Pimblett
Staff Reporter

 

More than 100 Civil War scholars
and enthusiasts will meet in Lexington
in April for the second Stonewall
Jackson Symposium, sponsored by the
Garland Gray Research Center of the
Stonewall Jackson House.

*‘We have people coming from all
over the country,’’ said Michael
Lynn, the director of the Jackson
House. At least 16 states and Ontario,
Canada, will be represented at the
conference.

Plans for this symposium have been
under way since shortly after the first
one in April, 1986, Lynn said. Promo-
tional brochures were mailed in early
February to Civil War round table
groups and people who regularly
receive Jackson House mailings.

The symposium was completely
booked by mid-March, Lynn said, and
includes about a dozen people who at-
tended the first conference. The sym-
posium, to be held April 15, 16 and
17, will include eight lectures about
Stonewall Jackson, the Confederate
general who lived in Lexington for 10
years immediately before the Civil
War.

The first event of the weekend, and
the only one open to the public, will
be Friday evening’s keynote address
given by Frank Vandiver, the presi-
dent of Texas A&M University. He
will present a lecture titled, ‘‘One of

the Great Captains: Stonewall Jack-
son,’’ in Lee Chapel at 8 p.m.

The remainder of the weekend’s ac-
tivities will be limited to those people
who have pre-registered for the sym-
posium and paid the $100 registration
fee.

Vandiver, a historian who specia-
lizes in military history, has written
and edited 20 books and at least 100
scholarly articles and reviews. He is
the author of Mighty Stonewall, a bio-
graphy of Jackson, and Their Tattered
Flags: The Epic of the Confederacy.

The speakers for the weekend,
Lynn said, ‘include acknowledged
scholars who are widely published,
and some up-and-coming scholars’ of
Civil War history.

Other speakers include A. Wilson
Greene, Robert Krick and James Og-
den, all historians at the Fredericks-
burg and Spotsylvania National Mili-
tary Park; William Davis, a former
editor of Civil War Times Ilustrated,
Gary Gallagher, assistant professor of
history at Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity; James Robertson, the C.P. Miles
professor of history at Virginia Tech
and J. Holt Merchant, professor of
history at W&L.

All of the lectures except for Van-
diver’s will be held in Northen Audi-
torium.

In addition to the lectures, the sym-
posium will include tours of the VMI
Museum, a service and tour at Lexing-
ton Presbyterian Church, where Jack-
son worshipped, and tours of the

Baliles: Democrats
to bring Americans

 

By Sean Bugg
Staff Reporter

 

That America needs to regain its
consensus was the message Virginia
Gov. Gerald L. Bafifé’delivered Fri-
day when he greeted the Mock Demo-
cratic Convention on behalf of the
state of Virginia.

‘‘We must regain the American

consensus,’’ Baliles said to the en-
thusiastic audience at the convention.
“‘T will submit to you, that within this
hall, we have the instrument for doing
so.”’
Baliles said political parties need to
bring the American people together
“‘to stabilize the body politic, to move
the country forward.”’

‘*A political party is neither to be a
debating society nor a social club,’’ he
said. ‘‘Our purpose is to select and
support candidates for political of-
fice.”

The Democrats need to nominate
someone who can handle the budget
deficit, promote growth in science and
the economy, and bring the American
people together, said Baliles.

“‘Give us a candidate who will bring
us consensus,’’ he said. ‘‘And, while
you are at it, give us a candidate who
can win.”’

To do this, Baliles said, the political
parties ‘‘must be resolute and princi-
pled.’’

Baliles called the Mock Convention
‘ta most important and critical exer-

cise in democracy.”’

He was greeted with cheers and
flag-waving when he said, ‘‘For it will
be here that the Democratic Party will
select the next president of the United
States.\' 2.1. J

exhibit about Jackson’s wounding,
last illness and death.

Only one W&L student is registered
to attend the symposium, which is
scheduled during the last weekend of
the W&L undergraduate spring break,
Lynn said. She said the conference
was planned during a vacation so that
Northen Auditorium would be avail-
able and parking would be less of a
problem.

‘*We are grateful to have the use of
the university facilities,’’ Lynn said,
because the Stonewall Jackson House
does not have a lecture hall and would
be unable to hold the conference on
site.

Lynn said another symposium is
tentatively planned for April 1990.
The advantage to holding the event
every other year is to allow time for
new scholarly research, to maintain
interest and to allow for the practica-
lity of a small museum to sponsor such
a large gathering, she said.

The Stonewall Jackson House, at 8
E. Washington Street, is the only
house that Thomas J. ‘*Stonewall’’
Jackson ever owned. Now owned by
the Historic Lexington Foundation, it
has been restored to its appearance at
the time that Jackson lived there and is
furnished with period antiques, in-
cluding many items which belonged to
Jackson and his family members. The
house, which is listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, is open to
the public daily for guided tours.

Virginia’s governor remains un-
committed to any presidential can-
didate and plans ‘‘to serve Virginia
by helping broker the conven-
tion,”’ if the Democratic race for
delegates yields no clear front-
runner.

Gov. Gerald L. Baliles spoke at
the Mock Convention and after-
ward took questions from repor-
ters.

‘*We may be closer to the situa-
tion [a brokered convention] than
ever before,’’ Baliles said.

When asked what his strategy
would be in a brokered convention,
the governor said part of the
strategy was not to reveal it before

Baliles said ‘the convention re-
sults may be helpful’’ going into
the Democratic Convention this
summer in Atlanta. He cited the
‘“‘amazing accuracy’’ of the stu-
dent-run convention in the past.

“It has served both parties well
for the past 45 years or so,’’ he
said.

The governor was asked if the
student convention should institute
super delegates such as the real
Democratic convention has.

‘*They’ll do just fine without my
advice,’’ Baliles said.

The governor did have advice
for any potential political candi-
dates. A candidate must learn to
listen extremely well.

‘Don’t get intoxicated by all the
nice things people say about you,”’
he said.

Mumps continues;

20 new cases reported
since Christmas break

 

By Alice Harrell
Staff Reporter

 

Some students may be wondering
just how long W&L is going to have to
keep fighting its battle with the
mumps. Since October 1987, a mini-
epidemic of the disease has continued
to plague campus.

Dr. Robert M. Pickral reported that
there were 22 cases of the mumps be-
tween October and Christmas of last
year. Many of the students who were
infected with mumps have been pre-
viously immunized.

When Pickral called the epi-
demiology division of the State De-
partment of Health in early December
to obtain advice on immunizations for
the disease, they told him that they
wouldn’t currently recommend an
immunization for people who had
already been vaccinated once.

“In the event of an epidemic, 80
percent of the people will be protec
ted... [but] 20 percent may still be po
tentially infected,’’ said Pickral

‘IT can only conclude that the cases
we have seen are those 20 percent,”

he said.

Following the 22 cases last year, an
additional 20 cases have sprung up
since January at a rate of five to 10
new ones per month.

‘*Mumps is a viral illness, generally
a mild disease process,’’ Pickral ex-
plained. ‘‘Following acute infection,
someone can still shed viral [germs] in
oral secretions for weeks.”’

Pickral acknowledged that many
students were anxious about the pro-
longed spread of the disease, and
while the idea of having mumps im-
munizations for students on campus
was considered and attempted, the
State Department of Health denied
Pickral a recommendation.

‘*T personally recommend that those
who don’t have the vaccine, get it,”’
Pickral said. He suggested that those
who have been vaccinated should con-
tact a local physician at home during
spring break, if they feel uneasy about
contracting the disease

Pickral also would like to encourage
any students who have been treated
for the mumps this year outside of
school or who caught the disease at
home to notify the infirmary.

Delegates for the 1988 Mock Democratic Convention gather for Saturday’s voting session.

Robb says Democrats need
to represent the mainstream

A former Virginia governor remin-
ded the Mock Democratic Convention
delegates Friday night that the 1988
convention is the first in which women
have participated as students of W&L,
and was greeted with a mixture of
boos and cheers.

“Consider it another step toward
realism and authenticity,’’ former
Gov. Charles Robb said in the open-
ing address of the second session of
the convention. at

“I am delighted to be. associated
again with this prestigious...event,”’
Robb said, though he expressed regret
that it was the second Democratic
convention he has spoken to at W&L.

“I doubt that all delegates are De-
mocrats,’’ he said jokingly. ‘‘I doubt
that all are of drinking age. I assume
those weren’t real cocktails you were
serving at the pre-convention par-
fies.””

Robb then reminded the audience
that it was a Democratic congress and
president that repealed prohibition.

“This promises more excitement
than any in recent history,’’ Robb said
of the current Democratic race with
five candidates still running, ‘‘or at
least breathing.’’

Robb asked the question, ‘‘What
should the Democrats say to the
American people during the upcoming
presidential campaign?”’

He said that the Democrats will not
regain the White House if their mes-
sage is rejected by the mainstream of
the United States.

“The old Democratic coalition has
withered,’’ he said. ‘‘A once-broad
agenda has appeared to have withered
into a series of independent litmus
tests for candidates.”’

Ex-Gov. Robb said he hopes the
Mock Convention will offer direc-
tion to the Democratic party and
the nation, in a press conference
following his opening address Fri-
day night in the second session of
the convention.

“*T want to see them offer a posi-
tive candidate to the party,’’ Robb
said.

The convention nominated Mas-
sachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
on the second roll call ballot in
Saturday’s session.

**T wouldn’t be at all surprised if
the nominee is the real nominee,”’
said Robb, who has endorsed Ten-
nessee Sen. Albert Gore. Gore was
chosen as the vice-presidential
nominee by the convention. When
asked if it was inevitable that Du-
kakis would be the nominee, Robb
said Dukakis ‘‘appears to be a co-
frontrunner at the moment.”’

Robb added, *‘I hope if he is the

open on issues important to all of

Robb hopes that the super-
delegates at the National Democra-
tic Convention in Atlanta ‘‘act in
the best interest of the party.’’ He
said it was up to those delegates
whether or not to support tre lead-
ing candidate before the conven-
tion.

However, Robb said he does not
think the Democrats should nomi-
nate a non-candidate in the event of
a brokered convention.

‘| have never advocated looking
beyond the field of declared candi-
dates,’ he said. He added that
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo
could ‘‘conceivably be drafted, but
it’s not likely.”

Robb said that the addition of
super-delegates to.the Mock Con-
vention might have added to the
authenticity, but it would have
been hard for the delegates to rep-
licate elected officials and such.

The convention ‘‘was probably a
more realistic convention without
the super-delegates.”’

Foreign journalists gathered
to discuss ‘The Race of ’88’

By Sean Bugg
Staff Reporter

Three ‘‘heavy-hitters’’ in the world
of journalism discussed the 1988 elec-
tion process last week as part of a
panel symposium held for foreign
journalists. The symposium was part
of the Mock Convention.

The members of the panel were Be-
tty Cole Dukert, producer of NBC
television’s Meet the Press; Clark R.
Mollenhoff, Pulitzer-prize winning
professor of journalism at W&L; and
Ken Tomlinson, executive editor and
vice president of Reader’s Digest.

The panel was headed by Bill An-
derson, director of the United States
Information Agency.

Journalists from nations including
France, Denmark, China and Saudi
Arabia attended the symposium, and
asked questions of the panelists about
the American election process.

The panelists were unanimous in
predicting Vice-President George
Bush as the Republican presidential
nominee. They also tentatively predic-
ted the Democratic candidate to be
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Duka-
kis, although all the panelists expres-
sed uncertainties about that nomina-
tion.

When asked what was happening in
the race Dukert said, ‘‘It is obvious
that television has expanded its role in
the primary campaign.’

Mollenhoff agreed, saying that in

Change in Va. codes allow police
to require DUI blood tests for drugs

 

From Staff Reports

 

Beginning April 1, Virginia’s re-
vised law for driving under the in-
fluence gives police the authority to
require a blood test for drivers suspec-
ted of driving under the influence of
drugs other than alcohol. Drugs
covered by the law include illegal,
prescription and over-the-counter me-
dication.

‘*Driving under the influence of any
self-administered intoxicant is a threat
to highway safety,’* said Colonel R.L.
Suthard, Superintendent of State
Police. ‘*The revisions strengthen the
existing law covering alcohol and
drug-impaired drivers and will better
enable law enforcement to rid Virgin-
ia’s highways of drugged drivers.”’

The revised law allows police to
take a driver to a designated location
for a blood test, even if the driver has
already been tested for alcohol. Blood

ask a question and get a decent an-
swer....Now it’s absolutely impossi-
ble.”’ He attributes this problem to the
rise of the 30-second political com-
mercial.

**What you get is really an image,”
Mollenhoff said.

Dukert cited the public impression
made by the show of Robert Dole’s
anger in New Hampshire. Dole, upset
about the portrayal of his record in
political commercials, said in front of
a television camera, *‘Stop lying about
my record.”’

‘It was a terribly dramatic use of
television,’’ said Dukert.

“It was Bob Dole being Bob Dole,”’
said Mollenhoff.

The foreign correspondents asked
what the effects of polls were during
this primary season.

‘*T don’t think too many people look
to the polls to tell them [how to
vote],’’ said Dukert.

Regardless of what the polls might
say, Tomlinson said if the Democrats
could run a ‘‘master candidate, it
could be a real election.””

Polls are often contradictory,
Dukert pointed out, with people say-
ing they support two issues that are
diametrically opposed to one another.

‘They want all the good parts of
Reagan, and change,”’ she said.

On the possibility of a brokered
Democratic convention, Tomlinson
said it goes against common sense to
think that it would be brokered, but
the Democratic party has done surpr-
ising things in the past.

Dukert said the candidates will

samples will be sent to an office of the
Virginia Division of Consolidated
Laboratory where they will undergo a
general screening for alcohol and/or
other drugs.

If the blood test is positive for
drugs, the driver may be convicted of
driving under the influence of drugs,
Colonel Suthard said. First offense
penalties are the same as for driving
under the influence of alcohol, includ-
ing a fine of up to $1,000, a possible
jail sentence of up to one year, and a
possible license suspension. Repeat
offenders face much stiffer penalties.

‘*Statistics indicate that many drink-
ing drivers have also been using other
drugs,’’ said Donald E. Williams,
Commissioner of the Department of
Motor Vehicles. ‘‘Since there was no
legal blood test for law enforcement to
use prior to this law, there have been
few drugged driving convictions.

“In the last three years there were
two convictions for driving under the
influence of illegal drugs and seven

Track clips Eagles

In a contest that went down to the
final 3 events, the W&L track team
upped its dual-meet record to 3-0
Tuesday but lost one of its best ath-
letes to a hamstring pull.

Freshman Carl Gilbert, the confer-
ence indoor champion in the long
jump and winner of the 400-meter run
in last week’s meet, pulled a hamstr-
ing while competing in the long jump.

Head coach Norris Aldridge said
that, while he will not know the extent
of the injury for a few days, Gilbert
may be unable to compete in any run-
ning events for the rest of the season.

But W&L won the meet even with-
out Gilbert, outscoring Bridgewater
83-62.

A week earlier, seniors Andrew
White and senior John White, junior
Jamie Urso and sophomore Wes Boyd
each won two events as W&L easily
defeated Eastern Mennonite and
Newport News Apprentice.

Against Bridgewater, Andrew
White again won two events, as did
senior Richard Moore. White won the
110-meter high hurdles in 15.8 sec-
onds and the 400 intermediate hurdles
in 59.2 seconds, and Moore took first

A weekend of tough tennis at
Swarthmore, Pa., netted the W&L
mens’ tennis team one win and one
loss. The Generals, ranked No. | in
the Division III polls, beat Swarth-
more, ranked No. 6, on Saturday, but
dropped a very close match to No. 2
Washington College on Sunday. The
split should almost assure the Gen-
erals of an invitation to this year’s
D-III National Championships to be
held here in Lexington.

Due to rainy conditions on Satur-
day, the Generals faced Swarthmore
on the Pennsylvania school’s indoor
courts. W&L senior David McLeod
said that this was ‘‘easier to play on
because there are no distractions
[from the game].”’

Although the final score may seem
to the contrary, the Generals needed

place in the 1500 (4:17.2) and the
5000 (16:30.4).

Also winning events for W&L were
Urso, who took the 800 in 2:03.2, and
sophomore pole vaulter Phil Samp-
son, who cleared 14 feet. The Gen-
erals also took first in both relays.

But W&L won the meet by picking
up key second-place points in 12 of
the day’s 17 events and by sweeping
four individual events and both relays.

Bridgewater led by two points with
only three events left, but W&L shut
out the Eagles the rest of the way to
pull off the victory and keep alive a
string of 30 straight dual-meet wins, a
streak that dates back to 1984.

Against Newport News Apprentice
and Eastern Mennonite, the Generals
dominated throughout, winning 13 of
the day’s 17 events and scoring 112
points. Newport News was a distant
second with 45 points, and Eastern
Mennonite finished third with 19
points.

Andrew White, a three-time Old
Dominion Athletic Conference runner
of the year, won the 110-meter high
hurdles in 15.6 seconds and the
400-meter intermediate hurdles in 58
seconds.

John White took first place in the
long jump (21-1/2) and triple jump
(39-9 1/2) and placed third in the 400

all the concentration they could mus-
ter. Five of the six singles matches
took three sets, as did one of the dou-
bles match-ups.

Junior Robert Haley, playing No. |
for the Generals, lost to Andy Mouer
in two close sets, 7-5, 6-4. Junior Bo-
bby Matthews won his first set against
Swarthmore’s Steve Tignor 6-3 at No.
2, but lost the second after three tie-
breaker points, 6-7 (3). Matthews ral-
lied to close out the match in the third
set, 6-3.

W&L’s No. 3. singles player,
McLeod, also had his hands full
against Lindsay Williams. After los-
ing the first set 6-7 (3), McLeod had
to force Williams to a fifth tie-breaker
point before winning 7-6 (5). Wil-
liams regained control of the match,
however, and won the third set 6-3.

Sophomore John Morris, playing
No. 4 for W&L, also lost his first set,
to Vivek Varma; 5-7. Morris returned
the favor in the second, winning 7-5,

Middlebury slips past
lax Generals, 15-13

The W&L lacrosse team lost home
games Saturday and Wednesday, but
the 15-13 loss to 15th-ranked Middle-
bury showed the desire that the Gen-
erals lacked against Bowdoin four
days earlier, according to head coach
Dennis Daly.

‘‘We got beat against Bowdoin be-
cause we didn’t have the effort,”’ said
Daly, whose team has lost three in a
row. ‘‘Against Middlebury, we had
the effort, we just made some mis-
takes that lost the ball game for us.

‘‘We had a lot of kids that went out
there and played really hard,’’ he
said. ‘‘I’m not pleased with the out-
come, but I am pleased with the
effort.’’

Against 13th-ranked Bowdoin, a
17-11 loss, the Generals had to con-
tend with more than just the Polar
Bears. The game was marred by bad
weather—thunder and lightning that
forced a 40-minute stoppage of play
mid-way through the first quarter.

Down 1-0, W&L sophomore mid-
fielder Chris Mastrogiovanni scored
twice in less than two minutes to give
the Generals a 2-1 lead, but the Bears
answered back with three straight
goals to take away the only W&L lead
of the day.

Goals by senior middie Robbie
Stanton and senior attackman Peter
Smith tied the game at four at the end
of the first quarter, but the Polar Bears
responded with two goals early in the
second.

W&L sophomore attackman Chris
Giblin tied the game with two straight
scores. The Bears scored twice to
again take a two-goal lead, but junior

attackman John Ware pulled the Gen-
erals within one, 8-7, when he scored
the last goal of the first half.

In the third quarter, Bowdoin went
on a 3-1 run early to take an 11-8 lead
and scored again later in the period.
But the Generals hung close, scoring
three times in the third period and
once early in the fourth to stay within
one.

The Bears were too much for W&L
in the fourth quarter, however, scor-
ing twice to go up 15-11 with less than
five minutes left and then getting two
insurance goals late to nail down the
win.

Things went a little better for W&L
against Middlebury, and the Generals
went on two three-goal scoring runs to
keep the game close.

The key to W&L’s good play in the
first three quarters was senior goalie
Paul Burke, who made 13 saves and
key outlet passes to get the W&L tran-
sition game going.

‘“‘Anytime the goalie makes the
saves, you get transition,”’ said Daly.
‘*Burke gave us the best goal-tending
performance of the season.”’

But, despite the effort, W&L never
led the Panthers and was shut out in
the fourth quarter, giving the Generals
their fifth loss in seven games.

W&L again fell behind early, 1-0,
but tied the game at the 4:11 mark
with an unassisted goal by Stanton.

But the Panthers scored four
straight before the Generals answered
with an extra-man goal by senior mid-
fielder Sandy Harrison to make the
score 5-2 at the end of the first quar-
ter.

Middlebury regained a four-goal
lead early in the second period with its
own extra-man goal, but W&L shut
out the Panthers over the next 11

hurdles (1:02) while Boyd won the
100 meters in 11.6 seconds and the
200 in 24.2 seconds.

In the distance events, Urso took
first place in the 800 (2:07) and the
1500 (4: 18.6), and Moore placed sec-
ond in both events. Freshman David
Martin won the 5000 (16:33. 1).

The Generals took all four places in
the 400, with Gilbert first (52.6) and
junior Scott Williams a close second
(53.2).

Checking the field events, the Gen-
erals swept the pole vault. Freshman
David Johnston cleared 13 feet to take
first place and senior Robert William-
son finished second at 12-6.

Senior Sean Connolly won the jave-
lin with a throw of just over 163 feet,
and junior Fray McCormick won the
high jump by clearing six feet.

Other scorers for W&L in the field
events included Gilbert, who placed
second in the long and triple jumps,
and senior Norm Sigler, who took
third in the triple jump.

and shut the door on Varma in the
third, taking him 6-1. Senior co-
captain Chris Wiman, W&L’s No. 5
player, beat Tom Cantine 6-2 in the
first set, but slipped in the second, los-
ing 5-7. Wiman returned to form in
the third set, clinching 6-2.

Freshman Bill Meadows, in the No.
6 position for the Generals, dropped
his first set to Steve Sell 3-6, but bat-
tled back to win 6-1, 6-2 and take the
match.

The Generals had come out ahead
4-2 after the highly competitive sin-
gles action. Swarthmore did not fade a
bit in doubles, as W&L had its hands
full again.

Matthews and McLeod, the Gen-
erals’ No. 1 combination, needed
extra games to oust Mouer and Andy
Dailey in two sets, 7-5, 7-5. The No.
2 pair of Morris and Wiman had a
little better luck against Varma and
Cantine, winning 6-4, 6-4.

Big weekend results in two-match split for netters

Meadows were last off the courts,
needing three sets to beat Tignor and
James Stanley 7-6 (0), 6-7 (4), 6-4.
W&L had won the team battle 7-2, a
somewhat deceptive score.

Skies cleared enough on Sunday fo
allow outdoor play, but the weather
was cold and windy for the Generals
match against Washington College.
The play of the two teams would soon
make one forget the weather, though,
ad the two teams would finish the sin-
gles tied at 3-3.

Haley lost to Larry Gewer 6-1, 6-4
while Matthews countered by beating
Scott Flippin-Read in two, 6-1, 6-2.

McLeod needed three sets to take
Claudio Gonzales 5-7, 6-2, 6-2. Mor-
ris suffered only his second singles
loss of the season, falling to David
Marshall 7-5, 6-3.

Wiman needed four tie-breaker
points to beat Rich Phoebus in the first
set 7-6 (4). Wiman controlled Mar-
shall in the second, winning “tt 6-4, to

 

 

minutes and scored three times to cut
the margin to one, 6-5.

After a Middlebury goal put the
Panthers up by two, Stanton scored
his second goal of the day just as a
W&L power play ended to make the
score 7-6,

Middlebury scored three of the next
four goals to take a 10-7 lead. The run
was interrupted only by a Ware goal at
the 4:39 mark, the junior attackman’s
first score of the day.

The Generals continued to hang on,
however, as Mastrogiovanni and Gi-
blin both scored to trim the Panther’s
lead to one once again.

But the Panthers again prevented

the tie, scoring twice to go up 12-9 at
the 10-minute mark of the third quar-
ter.

Finally, the W&L offense was able
to put on a game-tying run. Two more
Mastrogiovanni goals cut the margin
to one, and Ware scored on a pass
from Harrison to make the score
12-all at the end the third quarter.

The tie was the best W&L could do,
however, as the Panthers dominated
the fourth quarter, scoring three goals
and allowing only one.

Looking ahead, the Generals will
stay in Lexington over spring break to
prepare for a game on April 16 against
Hampden- Sydney.

Baseball drops to 2-6 in ODAC with a 1-2 week

 

By Gary McCullough
Staff Reporter

 

The W&L baseball team lost its
second game to Bridgewater yesterday
afternoon. With a loss to Lynchburg
last Thursday and a win over Emory
and Henry on Saturday, the Generals’

record now stands at 4-7, 2-6 in the

Old Dominion Athletic Conference.
Junior Chris Cunningham took to
the mound at the top of the first inning
yesterday and pitched a very solid
game through the top of the fourth,
when he was relieved by senior Carter

Steuart. Cunningham gave up a couple
of runs in those first innings, but two
RBI from freshman Tim Wheeler and
junior Tom Skeen tied it up at 2-2 until
the sixth inning.

Steuart had a pretty sharp day on the
mound as well, but with a couple of
errors and a key hit, Bridgewater put
two more runs on the board in the
sixth. After a hit and a walk in the
eighth, Steuart was relieved by junior
Mike Temple, who then proceeded to
give up two runs on a double before
stranding an Eagle in scoring position.

In the top of the ninth, Bridgewater
put two men on before ripping one

down the first base line. The long
throw to third was off target, and the
Eagles had three more runs. Nothing
much happened for the Generals in the
bottom on the ninth, and Bridgewater
went home with a 9-2 win.

Head coach Jeff Stickley was dis-
appointed, mainly with the second
half of the game. ‘*We didn’t get peo-
ple on base after the fourth or fifth in-
ning, and that was the main differen-
ce. The game was really neck and
neck throughout most of the innings,”’
he said.

Last Thursday, the Generals fell 6-3
to Lynchburg in Lexington. Cunni-

ngham was the losing pitcher but gave
up only three earned runs and a walk.
W&L drove in one run in the seventh
and two in the eighth, but it wasn’t
enough to overtake Lynchburg.

On Saturday, W&L earned a 2-0
victory over Emory and Henry in the
first game of a scheduled double-
header. Senior Eric Acra gave up only
four hits in five innings before rain
brought the game to a close, and can-
celled the second game.

The Generals take a break for
exams but will resume the season on
April 10 when they travel to Mary
Washington.

clinch his match. Meadows, however,
lost to Peter Maller 6-4, 6-2, leaving
the doubles competition to decide the
match.

Washington College captured one
doubles win quickly, beating Haley
and Meadows 6-0, 6-4. W&L’s pair
of Wiman and Morris responded by
beating Maller and Phoebus 6-4, 7-6
(6).

Suddenly the No. 1 W&L duo of
Matthews and McLeod found them-
selves alone on the blustery courts,
playing a tie-breaking third set against
Gewer and Flippin-Read. The W&L
pair had won the first set 6-2, but the
duo from Washington College rallied
hard, winning the second set 6-1.

Matthews and McLeod got into
trouble early in the third set, giving
Gewer and Flippin-Read the first three
games. The Generals fought back, but
fell short 6-3. ‘‘We shouldn’t have

lost them,’’ said McLeod, ‘‘but we
spotted them those three quick
games.”’

This time the score reflected the
closeness of the match, with Washing-
ton College coming away with a 5-4
win.

W&L played host to Virginia Mili-
tary Institute on Tuesday in what is
light-heartedly referred to as_ the
Rockbridge County Collegiate Cham-
pionships. The Generals, with several
changes in their singles line-up, came
out wearing the crown, sweeping the
meeting 9-0. Unlike the week-end
matches, straights sets were the rule
not the exception against the Keydets.

The team will spend its spring break
in Florida, but instead of lying on the
beach and playing in the ocean, the
Generals will be playing several tough
teams including Stetson, North Flor-
ida and Rollins.

Women extend win
streak to six straight

 

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

 

The W&L women’s tennis team
continued its winning streak with vic-
tories in its last four matches. The
team, which has won six straight,
played a demanding schedule of four
matches in six days, and each oppo-
nent was regarded as a challenge.

Friday, Generals defeated Ran-
dolph-Macon Women’s College 7-2
on the road. Monday, W&L competed
against Sweet Briar College. The final
was again 7-2, with losses for the
Generals only in No. 3 singles and
No. 1 doubles. Head coach William
Washburn considered the _ perfor-
mance of W&L to be ‘‘exceptionally
good,’’ against a strong Sweet Briar
team. He especially noted W&L’s
‘*good team unity.””

The match on Tuesday was even
more commendable. The Generals
took on the Division I team from Vir-
ginia Commonwealth and _ finished
with a 6-3 victory. All three losses
were uncharacteristic. Freshmen Jean
Stroman and Kelly Martone, the No. |
and 2 singles players respectively,
were defeated in competitive matches.
The No. 3 doubles team of junior

Martha Christian and sophomore
Laura Eggers, also suffered a surpris-
ing loss.

Yesterday’s match was what Wash-
burn called a ‘‘cliff- hanger.’”’ W&L
won 5-2 after taking a 4-2 lead after
the singles competition. Stroman lost
in three sets in a ‘‘beautifully played
game,’’ according to Washburn, who
attributes the defeat to fatigue from
the tough schedule and Stroman’s par-
ticularly challenging opponents.

In doubles, the No, 2 team of Mar-
tone and freshman Shawn Wert won,
but the match with Christian and Eg-
gers was called for rain. At No. |
doubles, Stroman played with Teresa
Southard, who was filling in for the
No. 3 singles player, freshman Kathy
Leake. Leake missed the last two mat-
ches because of tendonitis. The pair
was behind 2-3 when rain cancelled
their match as well.

Washburn is very aware of the toll
that the three consecutive matches
took on the Generals, and regards
their performance as even more ap-
plaudable under the circumstances.

‘I’m proud of their courage and
devotion which came through with the
wins,’’ he said. The team will play
matches against Centre, Armstrong
and Emory and Henry during spring
break.

Linksters score ‘best win’

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

After struggling in its first two invi-
tationals, the W&L golf team reboun-
ded last week by putting together three
consecutive team rounds of 320 or
under.

The Generals won their first dual
match of the year last Thursday in
Lexington, defeating Shenandoah
319-392. Sophomore Ted Fox was the
medalist with a 76 on the Lexington
Golf and Country Club’s par 71
course. Junior Tom Wingfield and
senior Kevin Hunt shot 79s.

Friday was another strong round,
with the Generals posting a second-
place finish in an Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference round robin, again in
Lexington. Randolph-Macon won the
match with a 316 score, followed by
W&L (317), Hampden-Sydney (318)
and Bridgewater (334). Senior Gary
Campbell led W&L with a 77 while
senior James Sowersby added a 79.

Sowersby would come through in
the clutch for the Generals on Monday

in a dual meet against Longwood and
Radford. Coming in last off the Lex-
ington course, Sowersby scored a 76
to help W&L edge Radford 317-319.
Longwood was well off the pace with
a 352.

‘*That was the best win we've had
for some time,’’ said head coach Buck
Leslie. ‘‘We were behind Radford un-
til [Sowersby]came in. In fact, Rad-
ford thought they had us beat.”’

Fox and Wingfield shot 80s for the

And

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

 

And the winner is... Well, we don’t
know yet, but with the Academy
Awards just two short weeks away
you can bet someone is sweating it
out. To be exact; ten actors, ten ac-
tresses, ten directors, ten writers, all
kinds of behind the scenes people and
every major film company on the five
major continents are all sweating it out
waiting to see which one of them will
take home the most coveted prizes in
the world of motion pictures.

On April Il, as is the custom
around this time of year, anyone who
is anyone in the world of entertain-
ment will gather to honor the year’s
finest achievements in film at the
Academy Awards ceremony. This
year’s 60th annual awards ceremony
promises to be an evening of incredi-
ble extravagance, thrilling surprises,
chilling disappointments and long,
boring acceptance speeches. But hey,
if you won, you'd thank everyone you
had ever met too, right? Sure.

This year’s nominations even have
some interesting twists to them. In
1973, Bernardo Bertolucci received a
Best Director nomination for Last
Tango in Paris (he lost to George Roy
Hill who won for The Sting), Jack Ni-
cholson received a Best Actor nomina-
tion for The Last Detail (he lost to
Jack Lemmon who won for Save the
Tiger) and Vincent Gardenia received
a Best Supporting Actor nomination
for Bang the Drum Slowly (he lost to
John Houseman who won for The
Paper Chase). Now the ballot for
1988 again finds Bertolucci nominated
for Best Director, Nicholson nomi-
nated for Best Actor and Gardenia
nominated for Best Supporting Actor.
Who knows, maybe this will be their
year,

In addition, this is the first year in
the 59-year history of the awards that
an American director has not been
nominated for the Best Director
award. But enough about the nomina-
tions. Who really cares? All anyone is
really interested in is who wins, right?
Right.

So, without further ado, here are the
official Tug’s Tag Academy Award
predictions for 1988.

Best Picture
The nominees are: Broadcast News,
Fatal Attraction, Hope and Glory, The

the wi

Last Emperor and Moonstruck.

This year’s best picture race is going
to come down to Broadcast News and
The Last Emperor. Fatal Attraction,
Hope and Glory and Moonstruck were
all excellent films but they won’t win.
Broadcast News is probably the most
entertaining film nominated and is in-
credibly well acted but the Academy
tends to give the Oscar to a historical
film if it can. I hate to say the Acad-
emy is tight, but if we fed them coal
they would... Well, you know the
rest.

Tugs Tag: The Last Emperor

Best Actor
The nominees are: Michael Douglas
(Wall Street), William Hurt

(Broadcast News), Marcello Mas-
troianni (Dark Eyes), Jack Nicholson
(/ronweed) and Robin Williams (Good
Morning, Vietnam).

Like many of this year’s races the Best
Actor competition is going to be close,
but ultimately it’s going to come down
to Michael Douglas and William Hurt.
Douglas’ performance as Gordon Ge-
kko in Wail Street was the most capti-
vating and well-done of his career.
The acceptance of Fatal Attraction by
the Academy and his strong perfor-
mance in that film will also help pave
the way for his first Oscar. Hurt is try-
ing for his second Oscar in three tries
having won for Kiss of the Spider
Woman in 1984, and losing last year
to shoe-in Paul Newman who finally
won for The Color of Money after sev-
en nominations, but will fall short
again.

Tug’s Tag: Michael Douglas (Wall
Street)

Best Actress

The nominees are: Cher
(Moonstruck), Glenn Close (Fatal At-
traction), Holly Hunter (Broadcast
News), Sally Kirkland (Anna) and
Meryl Streep (/ronweed).

Early in the Oscar season everyone
was saying that it was the year of
Holly Hunter. Her performance in
Broadcast News is definitely an Os-
car-caliber performance but winning
will be no easy task. Like Michael
Douglas, Glenn Close may ride the
Fatal Attraction wave of enthusiasm
all the way to golden shores. There is
no question that her performance is
the best of her career and one of the
two best of the year but I don’t think
she’ll have quite enough to beat Holly
Hunter’s cuteness. Cher has been get-
ting all kinds of hype lately, but she
wasn’t good enough to win. The only
way she can win is with a sympathy

vote, but I don’t think she'll get it.
Tug’s Tag: Holly Hunter (Broadcast

News

Best Supporting Actor

The nominees are: Albert Brooks
(Broadcast News), Sean Connery (The
Untouchables), Morgan Freeman
(Street Smart), Vincent Gardenia
(Moonstruck) and Denzel Washington
(Cry Freedom).

This race won't even be close. If
there’s a God, Albert Brooks will take
home the Oscar for Best Supporting
Actor. Brooks’ command of his part
was so incredible that the critics ha-
ven't even given the other nominees a
chance of winning. There is no ques-
tion about this one.
Tug’s Tag: Albert
(Broadcast News)

Brooks

Best Supporting Actress
The nominees are: Norma Aleandro
(Gaby—A True Story), Anne Archer
(Fatal Attraction), Olympia Dukakis
(Moonstruck), Anne Ramsey (Throw
Momma From the Train) and Ann
Sothern (The Whales of August).
In the category of Ann(e)s it will be an
Olympia who will be the champion.
Anne Archer’s performance as the
‘“You come near my family again and
Pll kill you’’ mother in Fatal Attrac-
tion and Anne Ramsey’s performance
as Danny DeVito’s momma in Throw
Momma From the Train were both
excellent performances but the award
will go to Olympia Dukakis for her
wonderful performance as Cher’s lov-
ing mother and Vincent Gardenia’s
ever forgiving wife in Moonstruck. It
looks like there may be two winners in
the family after all.
Tug’s Tag: Olympia Dukakis
(Moonstruck)

Best Director

The nominees are: Bernardo Bertolu-
cci (The Last Emperor), John Boor-
man (Hope and Glory), Lasse Hall-
strom (My Life as a Dog), Norman
Jewison (Moonstruck) and Adrian
Lyne (Fatal Attraction)

From this group have come some of
the best and the most controversial
films in the history of motion pictures.
Last Tango in Paris (Bertolucci), A
Soldier’s Story, Fiddler on the Roof,
In the Heat of the Night (Jewison)
Flashdance and 9 1/2 Weeks (Lyne)
have all made their marks on the sex-
ual, religious and ethnic barriers of
Hollywood. This year all five direc-
tors deserve an award, but only one
can win. Since the first Academy
Awards were given in 1927, the

nners are...

 

Oscar: Film’ s Most Coveted Prize.

awards for Best Director and Best Pic-
ture have coincided 44 of 59 times and
15 of 17 times since 1970. This year
will be no exception.

Tug’s Tag: Bernardo Bertolucci
(The Last Emperor)

Other Oscar nominees to watch:

* Original Screenplay: James L.
Brooks (Broadcast News) — If he can
get by Woody Allen’s Radio Days,
James Brooks should win.

* Adapted Screenplay: Mark Pe-
ploe and Bernardo Bertolucci (The
Last Emperor) — This category will
be close but if Bertolucci can carry
Best Director and Best Picture, he’ll
probably win here.

* Foreign Film: Au Revoir les En-
fants (France) — This is a shoe-in!

x Original Song: (I’ve Had) The
Time of My Life (Dirty Dancing) — It
has already won the Golden Globe for
Best Song. It should win the Oscar as
well.

* Cinematography: Vittorio Stor-
aro (The Last Emperor) — This award
will most likely follow the Best Pic-
ture. If Storaro doesn’t win, Michael
Ballhaus will win for Broadcast News.

* Makeup: Rick Baker (Harry and
the Hendersons) — Baker is the per-
ennial favorite and should win again.

* Visual Effects: Innerspace —
The travel scenes inside the human
body in this updated remake of Fan-
tastic Voyage were absolutely incredi-
ble. If this award goes to Predator (the
other nominee) over Innerspace
everyone in the Academy :
shot and/or forced the watch Arnold
Schwarzenegger movies for the rest of
their lives.

Enjoy the Awards!

Two W&L Seniors market the world

 

By Dana Bolden
Staff Reporter

 

**People can make a political state-
ment, hail their ethnic heritage or just
wear them for the colors,’’ said senior
Ted Myers about his product.

Students may have noticed a small
ad in a recent issue of Rolling Stone
for ‘‘Peace Frogs,’’ the baggy shorts
with the flag of just about any country
you could think of on them.

What many may not know is that the
retailers of the Peace Frog design are
two of W&L’s own, seniors Ted
Myers and Victor Vesely.

Myers bought a percentage of the
company when he met the UVa. gra-
duate who started the idea. Now that
Myers owns a percentage of the com-
pany, he and Vesely have joined
together to retail the items in the U.S.
and Canada.

According to the pair, the name
“Peace Frogs’’ came from a Doors’
song with that same title. The shorts
are ‘‘a glimmer of hope in this restless
planet of ours, where terrorism and
political unbalance abound,”’ said the
two students.

The ad first appeared in an issue of
Rolling Stone last April and, accord-
ing to Myers, was followed by some
problems.

Myers said the long distance com-
pany did not hook up their line until 10
days after the ad appeared in the
magazine. The line was not connected
until one of Myers’s friend’s father,
who works with the FCC, called the
company and ‘‘got the ball rolling.”’

Myers said the day the line was
connected, they received nearly 80
orders for the shorts. Calls came from
all over the United States, Canada, the
Caribbean and even West Germany.

Vesely is planning to introduce the
product in Canada this summer.

**T think it will be a big hit,”’ said
Vesely.

He hopes that ‘‘Peace Frogs’’ will
soon take the place of the ‘‘Jams’’ that
are currently on the market. The pro-
duct has been introduced at trade
shows in Virginia, California and
New York.

*‘We just sold 12 dozen to a chain of
surf shops in New Jersey and are
about to introduce them to the W&L
community,’’ said Myers.

Vesely said he was afraid people

wouldn’t buy them because they might

be too trendy, but after thinking about
it he said that each individual pair of
shorts is unique because of the diverse

selection thev offer.
The shorts are rather baggy, made

of 100 percent cotton and bear a rep-
lica of the flag of just about any coun-
try you could possibly imagine.
While most of the shorts are almost
identical to the flags of the countries
they resemble, the pattern of the
shorts does put some limitations on the
design. Vesely points out, however,
all of the colors of the flags are on the
shorts.

“*Peace Frogs’’ cannot display the
American flag on their shorts because
it is illegal to sit on the U.S. flag.

The shorts come with a disclaimer
indicating that the shorts are not in-
tended to offend anyone, buy Myers
said some people have taken offense.
‘*There were some Islamic people
who got upset when they saw we were
selling shorts with the Saudi Arabian
flag,’’ said Myers.

Among the biggest sellers for this
year are the Soviet Union, Australian,
Jamaican and Ethiopian shorts. They
did sell many Irish shorts for St.

Patrick’s day, as well. Another popu-
lar style is the reversible Iraq/Iran
short. He said the communist country
shorts are quite popular on the VMI

campus.

Both Myers and Vesely agree that
the best part of selling the shorts is
watching the people decide which
ones they want.

‘Some people come and pick
through the shorts for at least 20
minutes before they decide because of
the number of flags that we have,’’
said Vesely.

Last year’s shorts were not as de-
tailed as those offered this year. ‘‘We
tried to improve quality and silk
screening this year,’’ said Myers, ‘‘I
think our most intricate design is on
the Austrian shorts.”’

If you order from Rolling Stone, it
will take 4-6 weeks for your order to
arrive. Myers said if you order from
them you can either pick your shorts
from available supplies or receive
your shorts in about 2 weeks.

The shorts sell for $24 and to make
your ‘‘Peace Frogs’’ wardrobe com-
plete, you can also buy shirts and pull-
overs from the pair. You can reach
Vesely at 463-6956 or Myers at
463-4729 for orders or information.
