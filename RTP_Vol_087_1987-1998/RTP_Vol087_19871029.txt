This fall the enrollment at
‘Washington and Lee University has
‘reached 1,543 students, an 8 percent
increase over the enrollment in the
efall of 1986. An increase has been
shoticed i in all of the classes except the
sophomore class
+ The size of the freshman class
grew to 432 students, an increase of
*7.8 percent; the junior class grew to
,384 students, an increase of 20 per-
cent; and the senior class grew to 341
*students, an increase of 8.3 percent.
,Thesophomore class decreased 1.5
‘percent, to 386 students. The enroll-
*ment at W&L represents 46 states,
the District of Columbia, two U.S.
territories, and 14 other countries.

Assistant to the President, attributes

growth of the student body from 1,350
students to 1,500 students when the
choice to become a cooedducational
institution was made. The increase
was built to maintain male enroll-
ment of approximately 1,000 to con-
tinue the traditions in disciplines
such as athletics and to maintain
across the board the programs that
succeeded when W&L was all male,
according to Parsons. However, the
increase was planned as a more
gradual _ process, _ tentatively
reaching 1,500 around the year 1992,
he added.

“Part of the increase is planned.
The rest is bonus which came about
through the high retention rate,”
Parsons said. There are also transfer
students. The amount of transfer
students can be controlled by a limit
set by the administration or a refusal
to accept transfers, but Parsons
hopes that this won’t be necessary.

Parsons does not expect any fur-
ther increase in the size of W&L, say-
ing “the thought right now is to
stabilize enrollment. ‘“‘One of the ad-
vantages of W&L is the close faculty-

student relationship. The larger we
get, there is some erosion of the sense

And to top it all off

of friendliness. The larger we get, the
more we lose the characteristics of
W&L.”

Parsons says he has not heard any
actual complaints from students,
faculty, or alumni; however, in
casual conversation her has heard
hopes that the university will not get
any larger. When he was a student
here in the mid-1950s, the ‘‘magic
number’”’ was 1,000, including the law
school. The number was then chang-
ed to 1,200, and now it is 1,500. ‘‘The
question is, when do we put on the
brakes,’’ said Parsons.

‘We have put some pressure on
ourselves and taken away some of
the qualities of th academic life and
social life,” he said, adding that
there is a “little sense of over-
crowding,’ in the Co-op, for exam-
ple. Some of the class sections have
also become overcrowded. With the
increase in enrollment, the percen-
tage of the student body that you can
claim to know goes down,”’ Parsons
said, Parsons believes that the feel-
ing that students and faculty have of
knowing everyone is important and
that there is ‘‘more anonymity” now

when one walks down the Colonnade.

Professor Sidney Coulling, who
began teaching at W&L in 1956, sees
the increase as a ‘‘trade-off’’.

“If you compare W&L ney to 30
years ago, there is a more diverse
faculty, an expanded curriculum,
and more extra-curricular activities.
In the organizations there is also
more diversity. For diversity you
have to have people to sustain it,”’
said Coulling, adding that for the
losses incurred by the increasing
enrollment, there are also ‘“‘compen-
satory gains in the expanded pro-
grams.”

This year the university hired its
first personnel director to do a job
that had been done by an ad-
ministrator as an extra duty in the
past. When you become “‘so big you
need a specific office and function to
deal with personnel,” said Parsons.
The increase in enrollment has a
“ripple effect’? which includes hous-
ing, food, and other additional
university services.

“The bigger you get, the more
complex it gets, and the harder it is
to get smaller,”’ said Parsons.

If you should ask any EC member
what he feels is his primary respon-
sibility to the W&L community, he
might reply, “defense of the Honor
System.’’ That seems obvious since
a large part of their job is to ad-
minister honor trials when the code
has been broken.

In accordance with that concentra-
tion on honor, the EC often seeks
ways in which it might improve our
Honor System. The National Honor
Conference, held this past weekend
at WEst Point, provided just such an
opportunity.

Vice President Pat Schaefer and
senior representative, Brandt Wood,
represented W&L at this conference
attended by nineteen other colleges
and universities.

The conference concentrated on
honor after said Wood college and
how its inception in the student dur-
ing the college years led to more
honorable members of the private
sector. Wood said that he was im-
pressed, if not shocked, at the speech
of one member of the business com-
munity who related the lack of honor
in his generation’s business practices
and pleaded with college students to
rectify that situation in our genera-
tion.

Other speakers discussed ethics in
government and the military.
Defenders of military ethics were
numerous since most of the colleges
in attendance’ were
academies, including the

States Marine Academy, the United
States Merchant Marine Academy,
VMI, Citadel, and Norwich Universi-
ty.

Yet while both W&L represen-
tatives found the lectures educa-
tional, they believed they learned
more from discussions with other
students concerning their Honor
System.

The various schools represent/d
were divided into four groups.
Within these groups they discussed
how their systems were ad-
ministered and what offenses they
covered.

Schaefer said, ‘‘The strangest was
BYU.” Their code considered pre-
marital sex, drinking, and smoking
honor offenses and punishable by
suspension. Their system thus was
heavily codified, unlike W&L’s which
leaves the definition of honor to the
generation involved.

The military academies described
strict honor codes which disallowed
lying, cheating, stealing, and ‘‘those
who tolerate those who perform these
acts.’’ Students may be punished for
not turning an honor offender. The
White Book, on the other hand, does
not compel anyone to do the same.

However, most of the systems were
less strict than W&L’s. Wood in-
dicated that Princeton represen-
tatives to the conference announced
that their system only covers
academic affairs—that is cheating.
They believed their student body to
be too large to assess honor viola-
tions outside the classroom. Even in

EC members attend seminar

felt “‘squeamish about action against
the students for fear of law suits,”’ ac
cording to Wood.

Only the Engineering Department
of the Iniversity of Michigan has an
Hone System which also covers non-
acy demic offenses. Schaefer ex-
y_ained that their system is very dif-
ferent from ours in that Honor Board
members are appointed, not elected,
and punishment consists of anything
from suspension down to posting of
signs around campus.

One feature in which all other
schools, with the exception of UVA,
differed from W&L was in the ad-
ministration of the Honor System.
These schools allowed faculty total or
at least partial administration.

W&L and UVA were also the only
schools supportive of the single sanc-
tion of expulsion. Schaefer indicated
that when asked about our policy and
whether we believe that a truly peni-
tent offender should not receive a se-
cond chance, he said, ‘“‘Yes, you can
get a second chance, but not at our
school.’ Representatives from the
other schools chided him about this
statement for the remainder of the
conference. Schaefer added, ‘‘Many
thought that the single sanction was
too harsh.”

Even the military academies who
claimed to have single sanction
systems related their leniency
toward some ‘‘plebes”’ the equivalent
of VMI’s “rats’’ because they might
be ignorant of the system. Wood
said, “‘They are more likely to expel

Students tell of sharing houses with disturbed spirits

Rockbridge County was establish-
ed by act of the Virginia Legislature
and Lexington named its county seat
in 1778.

With a history of more than 200
years, and houses which have existed
for much of that time, it is expected
that stories of ghosts, haunted
houses, and unexplained phenomena
would arise, particularly around this
time of year.

So today, only two days before All
Hallow’s Eve, we hear the tales of
three houses in Lexington and the
county which are homes of W&L
students.

You may decide for yourself
whether such happenings could have
really occurred, when...no one else
was in the room.

The old Higgins Place is past East
Lexington and beyond Bean’s Bot-
tom. The original section of the
house is between 150 and 200 years
old, but the house has had additions
as recently as a few years ago, accor-
ding to third-year law student Mur-
ray Stanton, who lives there with
senior Jim Williams.

The room which Stanton says is
haunted is in the older part of the
house, in the section where William’s
room is located.

Williams has not experienced any
phenomena resembling ghosts or
spirits, but Stanton said that he has
heard two different sounds coming
from William’s room during the past
two summers, when Williams has not
been living in the room.

“Oeeasionally, you'll hear a
woman’s laughter’’ in the room,
Stanton said, and at other times
‘you'll hear two men having a con-

versation at a normal voice level.’
Stanton said he has not been able to
understand what the men say, only
that there are two different men
speaking.

Stanton is not the only person who
has heard the voices. He said that a
previous roommate and a friend who
visited the house also heard the
noises from the room, although one of
them probably wouldn’t admit it.

“It only happens when no one is
staying in that room.”’

Thomas Herndon and Paul Eyerly
live in the Castle, an old stone
building at 8 S. Randolph St.

The Castle is one of the oldest
buildings in Lexington, having sur-
vived the fire of the late 1700’s that
almost destroyed the town.

During the nineteenth century, a
man named Phil Nunn lived in the
Castle. Nunn was a huge black man
who earned money by doing odd jobs
all around Lexington. He was so
large that he could not buy shoes to
fit, so he strapped planks of wood
beneath his feet.

Lexington residents always knew
when Phil was approaching because
they could hear the peculiar noise
that his plank shoes made as he walk-
ed along the street.

Phil managed to save a substantial
sum of money from his work, and as
the story goes, he hid all of it within
the walls of the Castle. Unfortunate-
ly, he had paper money, which the
rats in the building chewed to pieces.

After that, Phil insisted that he be
paid in coins, not currency, and con-
tinued to hoard his money at the
house. Some folks say that he began
to hide his money in a tree outside the
house just to be sure the rats couldn't

OPINION
Great

While students’ parents are here at Washington and Lee, it
seems to be a good time to look closely at what makes W&L
the special place that it is.

 

Of course, one of the things that stands out at W&L is the
the tradition that comes with the campus. Although many
traditons have changed over the years, many still endure.
The friendliness of the student body and administration on
the campus can always make a good impression on visitors,
prospective students, alumni and parents.

The Honor System is perhaps the most unique aspect of the
university. Not only are students on their honor not to lie,
cheat or steal, they are entrusted with running the entire
system. One would be hard-pressed to find another university
that allows the students to administrate a system that allows
for only one punishment, permanent expulsion from the
university.

The aspect of trust in the student body by the administra-
tion is a current theme at Washington and Lee. Although the
administration does try to provide guidance at times, the
students are generally allowed to run their affairs on their
own. The freedom W&L students are allowed teaches them
how to handle large amounts of responsibility. Therefore,
they are well-prepared to enter the working world.

Washington and Lee also provides encouragement for stu-
dent athletes. Even though no athletic scholarships are of-
fered, athletes are encouraged to develop their skills in a
sport because of love for the game and competition, not
because it is the only thing keeping them in school.

The encouragement the water polo team has received from
the student body this year also shows the students’ growing
involvement in sports. The team has set a goal for this
weekend’s game: to break the noise record set in the
Metrodome during the 1987 World Series. The Generals are
competing for the Southern Conference title against the Univ-
crsity of Arkansas-Little Rock. The Phi would like to en-
courage all parents and students to attend this game and give
the Generals all the support they can.

Naturally, there are some problems at this university, but
they all can be solved. A revival of the speaking tradition at
W&L would definitely improve the impression given to cam-
pus visitors. The speaking tradition, which requires that peo-
ple greet everyone they meet on campus (except of course, in
situations such as large crowds). This used to be enforced by
a student committee that imposed fines for violations. We do
not think that a fine system would bring this tradition back;
only student interest can do that. If students want to have a
university known for its gentlemen and women, this tradition
should definitely see a revival.

All in all, there are many aspects of Washington and Lee
that deserve special attention. Students also need to realize
that to keep this university the special place that it is re-
quires effort and involement. Otherwise, this school may be
a for the worse when we return as alumni, or perhaps
parents.

Wé&L

MY VIEW
By Frank Watson

 

 

In my last article I tried to point out
some of the prevalent problems
which face Washington and Lee to-
day, but I didn’t mean to sound too
disparaging. Certainly several situa-
tions here on campus can and need to
be improved upon, yet when it is all
said and done and when the dust has
finally settled, I think that W&L of-
fers one of the best liberal educations
in the country. Our student body has
an intellectual yet common sensical
approach to academics, our faculty
is devoted and accessible, and our
honor system is virtually unequalled
in excellence. Yes W&L, it is, in
many ways, a time to gloat. But how
can we best grasp that inexplicable
essence of W&L which distinguishes
it from the infinitisimal blurbs of
other colleges sunk in the privy of
abyss? Well let’s take a look at the
supposedly comparable colleges
which, probably at this very mo-
ment, some wire-rimmed, granola-
eating guidance counselor is pawning
off to his unsuspecting seniors as
W&L’s academic contemporaries.
How about Bennington College
located in the rural hills of Vermont?

Two chapels can change future of

MY VIEW
By Michael G. Herrin

 

Today, I stopped by the old admis-
sions office in Washington Hall, out of
curiosity to see what the Administra-
tion plans to do with the room.
Rooms always seem larger when
they are empty, and as I walked, |
looked around with this new perspec-
tive. As I glanced up, I noticed that
part of the ceiling was missing,
allowing one to look up through it.
The amount of space concealed by
this false ceiling is almost as big as
that below it. The room, when it was
new, was huge, and it had a balcony
at about the level of the new ceiling,
with a wooden rail still running along
its edge. A chandelier hangs in the
hidden space, its light now snuffed
out. From reading Crenshaw’s
history of Washington and Lee, I
guess that this room is, in fact, the
Chapel of Washington College.

Unfortunately, I think the con-
certed effort to cover up this
beautiful symbol of our past is in-
dicative of the attitude of the present
administration and board of trustees.

Pragmatism is held in much higher
esteem than aesthetics in this
modern age. There is no need for
such a grand room; let’s lower the
ceiling and erect partitions to make
better use of the space. Logic like
this robbed the Commerce School of
its central reading room: three
stories tall and capped by a magnifi-
cent dome. Logic like this interposed
cramped classrooms in the yawning
space of the Old Moot Courtroom. At
the same time these ‘‘logical’” deci-
sions were made in the interest of
space, more and more classrooms in
Washington Hall, the most spacious
rooms on campus, were transformed
into offices for the ever-increasing

You might have heard of this one
(and if you did you stayed away)
which sports the most expensive tui-
tion in the nation at around 14,500
beans a year. Here at Bennington,
where fraternities are about as
welcome as the plague, each student
devises his own custom-designed
academic “plan’’ that culminates in
a senior project. As you probably
guested, this school is heavy into the
arts with coed dorm rooms, twice as
many women as men, and a large
number of males who are light in the
loafers. Wow, I can just see it now! a
vertible 1960's hippie time warp com-
munity college where the students
spend half their time proving that
they really are not products of Nor-
thern preppy elite families even
though their parents can afford the
tuition, and the other half con-
templating the limitless possibilities
of a world utopia if only peace could
be achieved.

The bandleader of such nebulously
directed schools like that of Benn-
ington is none other the most lack
luster institution of the Ivy League,
Brown University. Sure, Brown of-
fers its students the hare brained
system of “pick your own courses”
but with an added twist: not only can
the students take their entire course
load on a pass/fail basis, but if a fail-
ing grade should occur it will be eras-
ed from the student’s transcript.
With the miniscule requirement of

bureaucracy of the administration.
It simply never occurred to anyone
either to limit the number of
bureaucrats or to house them off
campus: after all, many are never
contacted by students or faculty. The
ultimate irony will be the installation
of the Development office in the old
chapel: the worship of God replaced
by that of mammon. Our other

more obvious chapel still
stands. Its dimensions have been
enlarged, not contracted, since

General Lee’s time. It is structurally
sound, but it, too, has suffered burial
in the sense that its true purpose has
been concealed. General Lee built
the chapel as an expression of how
positive voluntary worship could be.
Although an Episcopalian, he did not
allow sectarian differences to pre-
vent him from taking his
predominantly Presbyterian
students’ needs into account. On the
contrary, he assumed spiritual as
well as administrative leadership of
the College, not through the force of
mandatory chapel attendance, but
instead by setting a positive spiritual
example. He attended services in the
Chapel regularly, and his students
followed his lead out of respect,
honor, and love for him and his God.

To the Editors:

 

 

The members of Alpha Phi Omega wish to
clarify the label of inconsistency attached to our
organization in last week’s article concerning
the General Volunteer organization.

with several goals, one of which is community
service. Last year, APO members held various
positions at Stonewall Jackson Hospital.
was a commitment to the hospital, in which APO
worked with patients in need of physical therapy.

twenty-eight credits for graduation,
even the slackest student should have
no fear when venturing into unknown
course areas. All this frivolity has
added up to a pent-up energy in the
Brown students, and as a result they
have begun to spin theories upon
theories about what the world should
be like. The most famous incident
was the cynaide pills debate in which
the student body felt that in the event
of a nuclear holocaust they should be
able to forego the slow death of radia-
tion by committing suicide with the
pills. The university prohibited the
students from distributing the pills,
and of course the students were
enragéd that they had been denied
their right to take their own lives. It
seems that under the bogus claims of
the university’s “liberal education”
the Brown students had logically ied
themselves to avoid life altogether in
haven of inconsequential thought, or
in what I like to call “Bon Jovi in-
tellectualism”’.

At the other end of the spectrum
there is the southern conservative
school Wake Forest University. Like
the other schools mentioned, Wake
Forest has a student body with high
SAT scores and intellectual ability,
but unlike the others it is largely
stagnated by a powerful Baptist
board of trustees. Through a forceful
affiliation with these Baptists, Wake
Forest has all its fraternities housed

named for him is still marked. It is,
however, empty. The garments of
worship, the organ and the pews
linger, but the place of worship has
become a museum and concert hall.
Although Lee Chapel has become a
shrine to the man who built it, this
transformation has subverted his
purpose in doing so. He built the
Chapel for the worship of God, not of
General Robert E. Lee.

Our two chapels are thus, in dif-
ferent ways, sadly in need of
revitalization. Fortunately for us,
however, the university stands at a
crossroads concerning the fate of
both. The old Washington College
chapel is now empty. It could be
restored, for use as a lecture hall.
The larger size of the school has
brought with it some large class sec-
tions, and the ‘‘new”’ hall would be a
welcome addition to the campus
facilities, as well as a showpiece for
the college. The University owns two
houses near R.E,. Lee Memorial
Episcopal church which can be
restored for use as office space. I
believe the re-introduction of
academics to Washington Hall will
help close the ever-widening gap bet-
ween the administration and
students.

As for our new chapel, General

in university dorms, and archaic
policies, such as limited visitatior!
nours to female dorms, are strictly,
enforced. In short, the social at-
mosphere found at Wake Forest is
severely hampered by its outdated
religious ties.

I think we are on to something here
about what makes or breaks 4
university: the way in which a liberal
education is interpreted by the
university. For Bennington and
Brown, a liberal eduation means let-
ting the student loose into the sea of
academics to do whatever the hell he
wants; I think this ultimately breeds
ludicrous situations like the cynaide
pill controversy no matter
how smart the students may be. On
the other hand, for Wake Forest a:
liberal education is an intellectual
pursuit which must adhere
somewhat to a set of religious:
guidelines. Both these views, I think ‘
are inadequate for a true liberal}
education. Washington and Lee has,
the desired equilibrium between a re-,
quired curriculum and _ social

freedom, and this is the backbone of’ °

our university’s success and uni-
queness. On the most part, the’
university is continually evaluating,
itself and not blindly plunging down
the road as these other schools are, ‘
and the future of W&L’s liberal,
education, as I think you can see,
rests upon a self-policing which these '
schools lack.

+ next morning and then went out and

did it all over again in the spirit of

* youthful reckless abandon.
, But besides making your parents

wish they had purchased a large, af-

* fectionate Golden Retriever instead

of having you, an alcohol hangover
does no real damage. There is

* another type of hangover falling on

Halloween which is not quite so
harmless. It can even be fatal.

* For those of you who haven't

realized it yet I’m talking about the

. life-threatening candy-corn hang-

*over. Those orange, yellow and

white, sugar-filled cones are ruining
” America’s youth by stripping them of
+ their youthful idealism.

Initially, children are attracted to
"candy corn because, besides tasting
: good, they’re more fun than Silly Put-

ty to play with. These misguided kids
“continue eating the destructive
«triangles on Halloween night until

they have none left or their parents
make them go to bed; when they
wake up on November 1 their heads
hurt, they are dehydrated and mere-
ly saying the words ‘“‘candy corn’’
will throw them into convulsions.

By the time these disillusioned
youngsters forget about candy corn’s
illusion of good feeling it is Hallo-
ween again and they go through the
same thing. By the time the average
child reaches adolescence this
vicious cycle creates a subconcious
but pronounced pessimistic attitude
about the world. This pathological in-
hibition causes commonplace state-
ments like, ‘Why should I do my
homework or read literature if it’s
gonna hurt in the morning?”’ In the
meanwhile, countries like Japan,
which has a scarcity of candy corn,
are producing a better educated and
more enthusiastic generation.

With the exception of a severe Cap-
tain Crunch addiction that I suffered
during junior high school, which
caused me to regress into the fantasy
that I lived on Cruch Island in a Utop-
pian society, my worst childhood ex-
perience involved, as you might
guess, candy corn.

It happened on a normal day, in a
mall, in the prime of my youth. I was
shopping with my mother and three
sisters when it was suggested that I
purchase some chocolate since
everyone was hungry. I had every in-
tention of getting chocolate but my
eyes were soon invited by the hyp-
notizing triangles.

You can imagine how dissapointed
my family was when I showed up
with four dollars worth of candy
corn. I ate the majority of this candy
corn alone and for those of you
unaware of how much candy corn
you can buy for four dollars believe
me when [ tell you it’s no small quan-
tity.

Tho next morning was very
unpleasant as I experienced candy
corn hangover at a toxic level. The
reprecussions of such an experience
are not obviously recognizable but
they definetely exist, even today. The
fact that I even wrote an article on
this shows that something must be
wrong with me.

The time for action is now. Crack
may be serious but candy corn is
devastating--threatening the future
of America. We need a ‘‘just say no”’
attitude to candy corn and millions of
government employees or a well run
company to help erradicate the pro-
blem before it’s too late.

‘Student spends summer

+ By David McDowell
+ Staff Reporter

 

David Montgomery, a senior Euro-

«. pean history major, rubbed elbows,
literally, with Rockbridge County
* last summer. After his summer here
, Montgomery is of the opinion that

Washington and Lee students don’t
« really get to see Rockbridge County

up close. i

Says Montgomery, ‘Seems like
» you can go to W&L for four years and
don’t really see what it ]Rockbridge

* County is like.”

Most W&L students confine their
dealings with Rockbridge residents
* to professors, coaches, and other

university employees, and as Mon-
° * : :

tgomery is quick to point out, they
»are not representative of the

Rockbridge natives.
“T see them as more of an attach-
» ment to the student body than as part
of the county,” Montgomery said.

  

‘in Rockbridge County

From his experiences, Rockbridge
residents share his view of the W&L
community--somewhat remote and
not really concerned with county
issues,

Montgomery, along with a handful
of other W&L students, spent the
summer working at the Blue Bird
Bus Company in Buena Vista. Mon-
tgomery worked in chassis prepara-
tion; specifically, he took batteries
out of buses, drilled holes for hoses—
that sort of stuff.

Montgomery found his co-workers
amiable enough, describing them as
“real helpful’. Apparently his being
a college student created no unplea-
sant tensions with his fellow workers.

“They seemed to be pretty im-
pressed with ]Washington and
Lee[,”’ he said. ‘“‘They kidded us
about being college students, though.
They’d say stuff like,I bet you’re glad

Coulling writes book
about the Lee girls

 

By Margaret Pimblett
Staff Reporter

 

At this school, named after Robert
E. Lee, ask any student how many
children the Confederate general
had.

“Seventeen,’’ was one answer.

“T think he had 26,” another stu-
dent added.

And a third said, quite confidently,
“Lee had nine children.”

The person to ask for the answer to
that question is Mary Coulling,
author of ‘‘The Lee Girls’ (John F.
Blair, Publisher, Winston-Salem,
N.C., 1987, 242 pages, $19.95).

A book-signing party for Coulling
will be held Friday from 3 to 5 p.m.
on the main level of the W&L
Bookstore.

The book was officially released in
June of this year and has recently
entered its second printing.

Robert E. Lee fathered seven
children, including four daughters—
Mary Custis Lee, Anne Carter Lee,
Eleanor Agnes Lee, and Mildred
Childe Lee.

“The Lee Girls” is primarily an ac-
count of the life of those women, from
the birth of Mary, the eldest, known
as ‘‘Daughter,’’ through the
childhoods and early deaths of Annie
and Agnes, the closest of the sisters,
and the life of Mildred, often known
as ‘Precious Life,’’ the daughter who
spent more time than the others in
Lexington.

Necessarily, it includes informa-
tion about the general and his wife,
Mary Anna Randolph Custis Lee, and
the three Lee sons—George
Washington Custis Lee, William
Henry Fitzhugh Lee, and Robert Ed-
ward Lee Jr.

Publication of the book, Coulling’s
first, completed a process which had
taken more than 25 years of work.

During the 1950s, Coulling was
working for the Development Office
of W&L and writing for the Alumni
Magazine. She was looking through
some folders of letters in the W&L
library when she found an unmarked
folder containing letters written by
Annie and Agnes to a friend at West
Point. The letters were written while
the girls were students at the
Virginia Female Institute in Staun-
ton (now Stuart Hall).

“They were so spontaneous and
sort of ingenuous that I was just
charmed by them,”’ Coulling said.

The letters included topics with
which any college student can
identify—the food at the school,
names which they called their
teachers, jokes which were played on
the teachers, and the things they
needed to have sent to them from
home.

“It sounded so_ typically
teenagerish that I was just most in-
trigued,’’ Coulling said.

However, with her marriage tc

Lee Girls

 

Continued from Page 3
at W&L, and the birth of their three
children, she was unable to devote
time to continuing her research intc
the life of the Lee daughters.

The information she found was not
put to use until 1964, when Coulling
wrote a 20-page paper for a small
women’s literary club using the let-
ters and some books as sources for
information about the Lee girls.

“Nothing had been written about
any of the daughters,” she said.
‘More than 500 books had been writ-
ten about Robert E. Lee and one good
biography had been written about
Mrs. Lee, but not a single book had
been written about the younger
members of the family.”

Very few books about Gen. Lee in-
cluded facts about the daughters,
Coulling said, and those which did
mention the girls stopped at 1870, the
year of their father’s death.

After presenting her paper to the
literary society and to the
Rockbridge Historical Society, Coull-
ing was encouraged by Ollinger
Crenshaw, then head of the history
department at W&L, to expand her
work into an entire book about the
four daughters of Robert E. Lee.

In order to do that, Coulling had to
acquire permission from Mrs.
Hunter deButts, the last surviving
granddaughter of Robert E. Lee.

Coulling then spent time studying

 

letters at the Library of Congress,
the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill and other archives.

The writing of the book was not
begun in earnest until the early
1980’s, when two of her children were
out of high school, and she found time
to work on her manuscript.

“T tried to write almost every morn-
ing for a couple of years,”’ Coulling
said.

Once the manuscript was com-
pleted, Coulling sent it to Mrs.
deButts for approval, and began
looking for a publisher.

“The New York publishers were
not interested, because they said
these women were not flamboyant
enough,” she said. Neither had they
married important people nor had
important children.

“That was their criteria—those
three reasons.”’

Next, she considered university
presses, but ‘‘they are all so strapped
financially that they can do little
besides their own regional works.”’

Finally she contacted the John
Blair Publishers of Winston-Salem, a
company specializing in regional and
biographical works. They accepted
her manuscript and published it after
Coulling retraced her steps and
double-checked all the letters she us-
ed in her research.

In the five months since the book
was released, Coulling has traveled
throughout the Southern and Middle
Atlantic states promoting her work

 

Neville Richardson, Howerton Visiting Professor of Religion.

and being interviewed about Gen.
Lee’s daughters.

She has appeared on television sta-
tions from Charlottesville to Myrtle
Beach, S.C., and has been on radio
1980s, when two of her children were
out of high school, and she found time
Winston-Salem, N.C., and Birm-
ingham, Ala.

Reviews of or articles about ‘The
Lee Girls” have appeared in nearly
all the major Virginia newspapers
and in papers in San Francisco,
Nashville, Birmingham, and other
large cities.

In November, Coulling will par-
ticipate in the Kentucky Book Fair,
an invitational authors’ fair which
this year will also include Rosalyn
Carter, Pete Rose, David Halber-
sham, and Harrison Salisbury.

In the midst of the promotion of
“The Lee Girls,’”’ Coulling has begun
researching the life of Margaret
Junkin Preston, known as_ the
““Poetess of the South.’’ She was the
daughter of a Washington College
president, wife of a founder of the
Virginia Military institute, and
sister-in-law of Stonewall Jackson.

In addition to writing poetry,
Preston ‘reviewed hundreds of
books,’’ Coulling said. In order to
learn more about the work of
Preston, Coulling has been taking a
course in Southern literature from
Prof. Severn P.C. Duvall this term.

Coulling’s research into the lives of
these Civil War-era women has

shown her the difference between the
social structure of that time and the
present.

She said that she thinks both Mary
Custis and Mildred, the two
daughters who lived beyond their
twenties, would have been happier in
a less restricted environment.

Neither woman ever married, and
Mildred divided her time between
Lexington, where she lived with her
brother Custis while he was president
of Washington and Lee, and the farm
at Romancoke, Va., the resident of
her brother Rob.

“Women were just supposed to
stay under the protection of a
brother” after the death of parents,
Coulling said. Only in the case of
widowhood or other financial
necessity was it acceptable for
women to earn a living.

The widow of J.E.B. Stuart, the col-
orful Confederate cavalryman, was
one who was forced to work by
necessity. She became the principal
of the Virginia Female Institute,
which was renamed after her, Coull-
ing said.

In researching her book, Coulling
said she was interested in writing
more than just the life stories of the
daughters of General Lee. She
wanted ‘not only to show the
biographical information about these
four women but to use their actual
words as reflections of social
history” of the “‘tough era”’ following
the Civil War.

Professor teaches apartheid class
from personal experiences

 

By Joe Caccamo
Staff Reporter

Howerton Visiting Professor of
Religion Neville Richardson loves
Washington & Lee. He says he loves
it because he is free here to teach and
learn in an atmosphere that invites
freedom of expression, not racial
supression.

Richardson is a white South
African Professor and Methodist
Minister who is on sabbatical this
year, teaching courses on theological
ethics and moral issues.

Richardson is currently teaching a
course titled Religion 150, Christian
Ethics and Modern Problems. The
class has devoted the first half of the
semester to examing apartheid in
South Africa, an issue Which
Richardson says has “affected my
life in virtually every way.”

Richardson is fervently opposed to
apartheid. He says that though he
could not help but benefit from it
materially because he is white, his
spiritual consciousness suffers from
it’s very existance.

Apparently, Richardson’s great
spiritual consciousness has been with
him since his childhood. Though
Richardson was born in England, his
family moved to South Africa when
he was four. He recalls his most
vivid childhood memory being at the
age of ten, when he watched a white
man, assisted by the white man’s
black employee, beat a small black
child severely, right out in the middle

Down...Down...Down

Professor of business predicts fewer jobs

 

By Robert MacPherson

Staff Reporter

 

Students graduating in the spring
of 1988 will have a more difficult time
finding a job than their recent
predecessors because of the 508-point
plunge of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average on October 19, according to
a Washington and Lee University
professor.

Joseph Goldsten, professor of
business, said last week’s crash on

Wall Street will lead to an overall
economic slowdown and, in turn, will
reduce the number of jobs available
to soon-to-be college graduates.

“Consumer spending is a major
driving force in our economy,”
Goldsten said.

“We will see a fall in housing starts
and a decline in sales of large ticket
items, such as automobiles.”’

According to Goldsten, many
economists were calling for a reces-
sion in 1989. Before the Dow’s record-
setting nose dive, the economy had

been experiencing what Goldsten
called the second longest growth
period in U.S. history. He said that
because the economy moves in a
cyclical fashion, a recession was on
the horizon.

“I don’t think anyone would have
forecast this type of drop,’ said
Goldsten. ‘‘It may go down further
before it stabilizes.”’

He said the crash can be attributed
to several factors. An overpriced
stock market, public sentiment at the
time of the crash, and “underlying

deterioration” brought on by deficit
spending by the federal government
all played a roll in the Dow’s dive.

“We were living beyond our
means,” the professor said. ‘“‘There
was a strong willingness on the part
of the consumer to take on large
debts.”

Goldsten siad that overpriced
stocks were a result of a large con-
sumer demand.

“Stock prices were driven upward
as a result of public euphoria,’’ he
said.

of the street. “I can still hear the
sound of his fists hitting the little
black boy’s face,”’ he says.

Apartheid is the system of segrega-
tion in South Africa, a system that
Richardson claims was designed to
suppress the black and deny the
black of any chance of social,
economic, or political mobility.

Suppression of the black in South
Africa is achieved, as Richardson
points out, “by every way con-
ceivable.”’

The South African educational
system, according to Richardson
functions to mentally condition

blacks into believing that they are in- _

ferior beings and that their goals in
life should be to serve their white
employeers well. ‘‘Black kids are
put in a system where they are ex-
plicitly trained to do blue collar
work,”’ he adds.

According to Richardson, even
many prominent churches in South
Africa condone apartheid by twisting
the meaning of the Bible to show that
blacks were inferior, even in the eyes
of God. “It kind of puts them in the
position of the Israelites, the Chosen
Ones, while it puts the blacks in the
position of tribal people.”

The only concern that Whites hve
for Blacks in South Africa is that the
Blacks get their jobs done, Richard-
son said.

Richard anti-apartheid sentiments
show in his professional life.
Richardson teaches in an integrated
school in South Africa and he
preaches his Methodist faith to an au-

He also said that deficit spending,
especially on a large scale, is gen-
erally not necessary during a pro-
sperous cycle of the economy. Accor-
ding to Goldsten, deficit spending
should be saved for an economic
recession.

“The idea is to spend during a
recession and to have a surplus dur-
ing a boom, although we haven’t had
{a surplus] in years, he said.

The federal government was suc-
cessful in using deficit spending to
reduce inflation in the late 1970s and

dience that is 75 percent Black.
Richardson admits that he has
“paid a price’ for soothing his
spiritual consciousness. ‘“‘You lose
friends, gain enemies and bad rela-

tionships, but there is a benefit from j

being'a friend to the Blacks.”

What about the future of the Black ;
in South Africa? Richardson is not
optimistic. ‘‘What we will have is a
bigger dose of what we already .
have...more repression.’’ Richard-
son says that although the Blacks ©
constitute three quarters of the,
population in South Africa, they don’t
have the military capability to ex-’
ecute any kind of successful revolt. ,
“Only a wild optimist would say that
the future looks good for the Black in ‘
South Africa,’ Richardson adds.

As for his own future, Richardson
is not sure where he wants to be after -
he leaves W&L at the end of this year. ,
But one thing is sure: he is very hap-
py here. Richardson marvels over ‘
W&L, it’s physical beauty and rich ,
tradition. He is especially fond of the

honor system. As for the students, ’
“they seem to be very responsive and |
eager to learn,” he says though he }

would like to see more minority ;

students being able to share in “‘the ,

great W&L experience.” f
Richardson, his wife, and their four ‘

children are living in Lexington. ,

Aside from his teaching, Richardson
is avidly involved in the Baptist *
Church sports of all kinds. He |
coaches soccer, plays squash and
loves to knock around cricket when +

he gets a chance.

‘

‘

for graduating seniors:

early 1980s but it should have been
stopped when it was no longer «

necessary, he noted. :

According to Goldsten, since
deficit spending was part of the
reason for last Monday’s crash, thé
government cannot expect to use it to
wipe out the impending recession?
Consequently, he is not optimistic
about the future of the economy.

“There is a feeling of ‘What do we
do now’,”’ said Goldsten. ‘‘There are
some fundamental problems that:
have to be dealt with.”’ :

get near it.

After the death of his beloved wife,
Phil was not the easy-going man the
Lexington residents had known. He
became belligerent to his employers,
and morose around his friends.

People who walked along that sec-
tion of Randolph St. often looked
through the five windows of the Cas-
tle and saw Phil pacing in his rooms,
carrying his bag of money. And after
his death, some of those same people
insisted that when the moon was full,
they could see him still, shuffling up
and down Randolph St. in his plank
shoes.

Herndon and Eyerly have not seen
Phil in their house, but they have had
a few unsettling experiences. Hern-
don says the windows sometimes
open and shut by themselves, but
usually only on windy days.

And, on the first night that the two
were both in the apartment, Eyerly
was awakened by a scream from
Herndon’s room. Herndon said his
sheets were being pulled off his bed,
but no one else was in the room—no
one except the mouse that was runn-
ing across Herndon’s bed, dragging

 

the sheets along with him.
A woman ghost affectionately call-
ed ‘‘Madelaine’’ lives at 117

McLaughlin St., where Meredith
Walker and Keri Wessel lived last
year. °®

Walker said that one night Wessel
awakened to see a figure dressed in a

long gown ‘come out of the
bathroom” and into Walker's
bedroom.

“She thought it was me,”’ Walker
said, but then Wessel realized that
the gown was not a nightgown, but
rather a dress or evening gown, and
that Walker had not been awake in
the night.

On another occasion, Walker was
in her room reading, with both the
overhead light and the bedside lamp
turned on. After about 10 minutes,
Walker said, the overhead light went
off. No one else was in the room.

Walker said that often when she
was working in the kitchen, cooking
or washing dishes, ‘‘she’d be wat-
ching me.”’ As Walker explained, as
much as she can tell when someone
else is sitting in the next booth at the
co-op, “I'd know someone was there
behind me.”’

Walker’s upstairs roommate
nicknamed the ghost ‘‘Madelaine’’
and made up the story that she was a
woman who had been jilted by her
lover and later died of a broken
heart.

Within the house’s more than 100-
year history, someone did die there,
Walker said. But the victim was a
man who died after some sort of fight
nearby, not a despondent woman who
would return to the place of her unre-
quited love.

a senior than a freshman since the
senior is better indoctrinated in the
system.”

This was one area in which both
Schaefer and Wood thought they
might bring back some ideas for our
system. Schaefer indicated that we
might benefit from more “‘inter-
nalization” of the system, in other
words, each W&L student should con-
sciously apply the Honor System to
his actions. Schaefer thinks that
more frequent and intensive instruc-
tion in student awareness of their
honor and its importance might
greatly increase the effectiveness of
the Honor System.

Although W&L’s small size and
location in a small town struck many
of the other schools as ‘‘Utopia’’ ac-
cording to Wood, they were “im-
pressed with our success.” Wood

_ distrubuted many copies of the White

Book and explained the philosophy
behing our system and its founda-
tions in the character of Robert E.
Lee, who ironically was a graduate of
West Point.

Schaefer attributed our system’s
success to ‘“‘the lack of codification”
prevalent in other systsems. Wood
said, ‘“‘Other schools asked for per-
mission to use some of our ideas from
our White Book in their revisions.”
When asked what they really learn-

interested may inquire.
Although parts of Gaines
Residence Hall still remain

incomplete—scaffolding still stands
around its main lobby, the gatehouse,
the computer room is still not in use
and the enclosed courtyard still

ed from the whole weekend, Schaefer
simply responded, ‘‘I learned how
well our (honor system) works,” and
“how much I really appreciate
ours.”

Both Wood and Schaefer said they
realized that a system like ours
naturally works better at a small
private institution, however they
deny that it can only work in that

type of environment.
All in all our representatives to the
National Honor Conference

presented our system as best they
could. They are yncertain whether
many schools will actually imple-
ment either the single sanction or
student administration of their Honor
Systems, but they did what they had
intended before the conference, that
is to let these other institutions know
how serious we are about honor and
proud of the success of our systsem.
Wood called the weekend a “huge
educational experience.”’

While recognizing that ‘“‘we have
more student body participation than
other schools’’ Wood asked that all
students take a more active part in
their student government by atten-
ding the EC meetings each week,
Monday night, 7:00 PM. He added,
“We have ready access to the ad-
ministration.” Schaefer requested
that those who express their views
only through the Ring-tum Phi should
go to the EC with their problems so
that something may be done about
them. With such active participation
by the student body the Honor

resembles an ancient Indian burial
ground—the finishing touches are be-
ing made to W&L’s latest $8.1 million
addition to the campus.

Most of the residents of Gaines Hall
are pleased with the end result.

“I think it was worth it,’’ said
junior Susan Lewis, in reference to
the school’s decision to build the
dorm.

“T really think the school made the
right decision in building the new
dorm in suite arrangements and in-
cluding a weight room and laundry
room,”’ added junior Courtney Har-
pold.

Currently Gaines Hall has an oc-
cupancy rate of 77 percent, with 112
of the 193 occupied rooms containing
women.

Assistant Dean of Students Ken
Ruscio says he expects the current
vacancies in Gaines Hall to vanish
next year as students begin to take
note of the facilities at Gaines Hall
and take advantage of them.

“It’s hard to tell, but in.talking to
students, I think demand will exceed
the number of available rooms,”’ he
said, although he added that the
housing demand would be difficult to
predict.

The reason Ruscio is optimistic
about Gaines Hall is because of the
great number of modern conve-
niences it has—such as an elevator, a
laundry room that features nine
washers and five dryers, and an ex-
ercise room containing the most
modern Nautilus weightlifting equip-
ment.

The lounges contain televisions and
video cassette recorders, and kit-
chens are scattered throughout the

Two centuries after they adjourned
from Philadelphia, the framers of the
Constitution have reconvened at
W&L.

The arrival of the framers at W&L
comes through the generosity of
Susan Lane of Alta Vista, former
librarian at W&L.

Her father, the late Rev. David
Coblentz, collected the signatures of
the 39 constitutional delegates and
their secretary as a hobby over his
lifetime.

building. Soon, a computer room
that will enable Gaines Hall residents
to type their term papers without
having to leave the warmth of their
dormitory will be installed.

‘“‘What I really hope develops over
there is for some kind of community
and a nice place to live, not just
because it’s convenient, but because
it is fun. I think the potential is
there,’’ he says.

Ruscio said, that with the help and
organization of university-appointed
student resident assistants, student
activities such as film festivals,
political debates and guest speakers
can be held in Gaines Hall.

Ruscio said he also hopes to being a
program where students with similar
academic interests can live together
in a suite—a program in which each

Lane, when asked by the Alta Vista
Journal about her father’s reasons
for collecting signatures replied, ‘I
guess my father needed a focus. He
didn’t pursue the signers solely, but
was very much into the Civil War.”

The son of a veteran of the Spanish-
American war, Coblentz first
became interested in the history of
Nathaniel Greene. The minister ob-
tained 30 documents pertaining to
Greene, and then expanded his in-
terests to other areas of history.

A few examples of the entire collec-
tion include a letter written by
Thomas Jefferson concerning the
flooring of his newly built home,
Monticello.

group would work together to con-
solidate interest and learn more
about its particular academic in-
terest.

The most frequent complaint has
been concerning the long period of
time it has taken for the building to
be completed.

“It’s a drawback I suppose, but it
will be done,” said senior Andrew
Bouie.

Since last year, the sounds of
dynamite blasting, hammering and
sawing have prompted students to
complain, not only about the length of
time involved in finishing the
building, but the noise.

“It’s a hassle, but at least it gets
you out of bed,” joked Bouie.

Complications in weather and dif-
ficulties in completing the gatehouse,

Also included are a letter Stonewall
Jackson wrote when accepting his
commission in the U.S. Army, as well
as a letter by then-president of
Washington College, Robert E. Lee,
concerning the establishment of a
physical education program at the
college.

Lane said in regard to the collec-
tion, “It’s a fascinating world.” She
added though, ‘unlike a Van Gogh,
you can’t hang a manuscript on the
wall to ‘oooh’ and ‘aaah’ over.”

The display of the signatures adds
greatly to W&L’s existing collection
of documents and other historical ar-
tifacts.

Mrs. Lane said, ‘‘For all the money

which will connect the wings of the
building when completed, have been
much to blame for the delays in com-
pleting the building.

Ruscio, however, estimates all con-
struction to be completed on Gines
Hall by Dec. 1.

“(The construction workers]
decided to leave the gatehouse for the
end,’’ added Ruscio. The gatehouse,
which will serve as the central lobby
for the residence hall, will be design-
ed to accommodate lectures, con-
certs and meetings.

The new residence hall was named
for Francis Pendleton Gaines, presi-
dent of W&L from 1930 to 1959. It has
88 single rooms and 80 double rooms.

Ruscio said that housing applica-
tions for next year would be made
available to students next week dur-
ing registration for Winter Term.

The future of the signatures cur-
rently on display remains unknown.
The collection could be permanently
displayed at an institution, unless her
children demonstrate an interest.

As for now, though, the exhibit con-
tinues to be displayed in the Boat-

Student sponsors petition

 

By Jennifer Bandrowski
Staff Reporter

Rather than just complaining
about the big crowds at the Co-op,
one W&L student has actually tried to
do something about it.

Meredith Walker, a junior, cir-
culated a petition during the last two
weeks calling for additions to the
campus food store.

The petition, which Walker said
has garnered 300 signatures, reads as
follows:

‘What do you think about a bigger
Co-op and bookstore? Want a better
selection of food and more things to
charge home in the bookstore?

Interested in having more seating
in the winter time when you can’t sit

in the sun? What about a conve-
nience store with food, drinks, and
personal items with the option to
charge it home? If your interested in
any of these things, sign here!”’

“I did it as a favor to Mr. Darrell
(Director of University Food Ser-
vices),’’ said Walker. ‘‘We were talk-
ing about the horrible situation at the
Co-op...and I thought maybe a peti-
tion from the students would help.”

Treasurer Lawrence Broomall was
impressed with the student initiative.

“I think it’s a good indication of stu-
dent feeling about the condition
there,”’ he said.

Bookstore manager Tidge Roller
noted outdated facilities (such as the
“farm stove” used in the Co-op) and
a general need for more space.

“The thing that blew this one over

the edge was the point card,” Roller
said. The administration is aware of
the problem...and the petition may
have helped.”

Darrell said that when Walker sug-
gested a petition, ‘I said it certainly
couldn’t hurt...There’s a need for
enlarged facilities, and the ad-
ministration recognizes that.”

Broomall said, “It’s a problem
under study and has been for awhile
with no solution currently in sight.”’

‘“‘We’ve been talking (about it) for
around five years now,” Darrell said.

All noted that location is a big pro-
blem. They want the Co-op and
bookstore to remain central to the
campus, where it is easily accessible.

“| don’t know what will come out of
all this,’’ admitted Walker.

 

As the weather grows cooler, more students crowd into the co-op.

Says Montgomery, “I worked

I went out fishing with him five times

the stacks are a major problem.

Meredith Walker, a junior who
works at the front desk, said she tries
to stop people with drinks as they go
by. During an average three-hour
shift, she stops 20 to 30 people.

“Rules are there for a reason.
They are there to protect books, not
to make people mad,’’ Walker says.

The problem, according to Univer-
sity Librarian! Barbara Brown, is
that the food and drink brought into
the library by students doesn’t
always end up inside the students.
Spills and crumbs left by the untidy
snacker result in damaged books and
stained carpets.

With the progress of Gaines Resi-
dent Hall at W&L comes a welcome
addition in the basement—a fully
equipped exercise room,

Currently the exercise room
features eight new Nautilus
machines, three cycling machines, a
treadmill and a rowing machine.

Over the next few weeks, plans are
in the works to put mirrors on the
walls, supply workout progress
charts and add other finishing
touches, such as a clock, a telephone
and benches for the dressing rooms.

Many students, particularly
Gaines Hall residents, have called
the new weight room a much needed
alternative to the weight room in

sophomore Cathy Williams. |

of preservation.

But the damages are not always
immediate. A spill will cut into the
useful life of a book. Warren says
that a book that was expected to last
for 70 years may only last 40 years if
damaged.

The food and drinks brought into
the library can also attract unwanted
guests, accordiffto Warren,

Insects such as ants, cockroaches
and silvét¥ish may choose to call the
stacks home if they have a reliable
source of food. Warren says that in-
sects pose an even greater threat to
books than do spills.

New books are expensive, and Bar-
bara Brown says that her goal as
university librarian is to safeguard
the university’s investment by pro-
tecting the collection, some parts of

more of.”

Williams said she also likes the

said junior Melissa Anemojanis.
“it’s a more comfortable environ-
ment.”

During the year, the exercise room

Brown says that it is not the job of
the staff to police the library. In-
stead, she has instructed the staff to
stop people when they see them, but
her real emphasis is on education.

There are signs and trash cans
throughout the library, and
periodi¢ally,,an exhibit focusing on
the enemies of books is erected on the
main level.

Students have some ideas on the
matter. Dave Dietz suggested that
certain areas be set aside for food

Campus dogs are
allowed free reign

 

By Shawn Crawford
Staff Reporter

Just as the campus dogs are
treated with high regard at the
University of the South, W&L’s
canine companions are allowed free
rein within the student domain.

It is a common and reassuring
sight to see them romping about in
the Johnson grass in front of the
library, or to be fetching a stick for a
friend on the sloping green Colon-
nade. :

Yet with their seemingly boundless
territory and inexhaustible energy,
one might wonder if they overstep
their welcome and tread on the toes
of those less inclined to consent to
such liberty.

In 198 a W&L team of ar-
chaeolgists began to excavate the
Barger-Riddlebarger Farmstead in
Botetourt County.

Professors John McDaniel and
Kurt Russ, along with student Jeff
Blomstead, submitted a final report
of the farmstead called ‘‘Ar-
chaeological Investigations of a 19th

Century Appalachian Farmstead:
' The Barger-Riddlebarger Farm in
Botetourt County, Va.”

did,” added Head Nurse Mrs.
Josephine McCown.

Campus Security also denied hav-
ing any problems, though they joked
of complaints from professors who
thought that on Thursday mornings
“the dogs are brighter than some of
the students.”

Perhaps the most problems occur
at the dining hall where students are
willing to give the dogs leftovers.

Gerald Darrell, Director of Food
Services, says that the incidence of
dogs coming into the dining hall is
“not a real problem, but is an occa-
sional problem.”

“Sometimes the dogs aren't
agreeable, they don’t want to go out,
and that makes us uncomfortable,”’
he said.

He also explains that they have a
three-step policy toward removing
and controlling a dog in the dining
hall.

“First we ask the students if they
know whose dog it is. If the dog has a
tag, we'll look at that for a name and
will contact the owner and tell him to
come and get the dog. If that doesn’t
work, we call the dog catcher to come
pick him up,” he said.

Darrell expressed reluctance to
carry out the final step but explained
that it is against, Health Department
regulations to have a dog in an eating

disassembling the farm, piece by
piece, and transferring and
reassembling the structures at the
museum. The museum intends to ex-
hibit this farm and compare it to
others from other cultures. Pro-
fessor John McDaniel called this an
“amazing project.”

According to Professor Kurt Russ,
the excavation’s function was
primarily to find out “about the
lifeways of rural Appalachian peo-
ple, what they did, and how Euro-
Americans adapted to the environ-
ment.”’ Several students have been
involved in the excavation during the
past year, working long hours on the
project.

Systematically surveying the land,
using various excavating devices
along areas 5’ x 5’, the archaeologists
were able to discover. several
buildings and artifacts. The farm

establishment, and that this is their
policy.
Another area where the dogs
create a disturbance is in the library.
Meredith Walker, a student worker
at the library, said, ‘‘We normally
don’t have a problem, but they do get
in from time to time.”

Dick Grefe, a reference librarian,
said “There are problems. Nights
tend to be hectic. There were two
famous incidents last year where a
dog used the floor beside a carrel as a
restroom.”

He said that the dogs usually cause
the most problems when the seasons
reach their extremes, such as during
the winter when the rains and cold
pervade Lexington, and during the
“Dog Days’’ of summer when the

heat is unbearable.

A couple of years ago a concerted
attempt was made to remove any
dogs that were running around cam-
pus unsupervised, but this met
with great resistance from the
students and was not continued. Lex-
ington has a leash law which applies
also to the W&L campus, but which
has not been strictly enforced.

Since the library and the Dining
Hall have specific guidelines to con-
trol the presence of pets, it is ad-
visable that students and owners
alike respect these policies and
refrain from inviting the dogs inside.
However, as long as these few re-
quirements are met, the campus
dogs should meet no resistance to
their running free within the sanctity
of the W&L community.

a 19th century farm

consisted of a springhouse, corn crib,
smokehouse, granary, apiay,
washhouse, logbarn and tobacco
barn. The common agricultural pro-
ducts of the area consisted of corn,
wheat, fruit, vegetables, livestock
and tobacco. This farm was first pur-
chased in 1783 by William Maxwell,
and then bought and sold five more
times, eventually to the Rid-
dlebargers in 1884. Over this 100-
year span, the land occupied by the
farm increased greatly in size.

According to W&L’s team’s report,
the farm “was largely self-sufficient
and prosperous.”

One owner was known to grow
tobacco, own livestock and keep
bees. However almost every owner
built new structures on the farm,
oo varying the farm’s func-

ions.

Using a transit-excavating devise,

the team could locate areas
of activity. They found hundreds of
artifacts which they organized
“quantitatively to how they function-
ed in the past.”’

Russell also said that the outhouse
is particularly interesting ar-
chaeologically ‘because artifacts
like waste ends up there through
time.”

He says they ‘“‘can take ceramics
and quantitate a formula calculated
by an archaeologist in South Carolina
to find the date of when that ceramic
or structure was built.”’

The archaeology team states that
hundreds of sites similar to the
Botetourt Farmstead exist around
Lexington and neighboring towns.

Twelve other historic sites are
situated within a 3.5 mile radius of
the Barger-Riddlebarger Farm,
among pre-historic sites as well.

Bed and Breakfasts offer visitors a change of pace

 

By Marie Dunne
Co-editor

 

As parents of W&L students are
probably all too aware, it is often dif-
ficult to find a hotel to stay at for big
weekends like parents’ weekend or
homecoming. Many hotels are often

booked solid years in advance fore-
ing parents to stay at hotels in Staun-
ton and Roanoke

There are some places to stay in
Lexington that parents may not be

familiar with. Bed and Breakfasts
are becoming more popular national-
ly and several bed and breakfast
homes and one bed and breakfast
reservation service have opened in
Lexington in the past two years. Bed
and breakfast owners take pride in
being a different sort of place to stay
compared to hotel chains.

Part of the charm of bed and
breakfasts is the atmosphere—
visitors feel like they’ve stopped by

to spend a few days with a friend.
Breakfast, generally a continental
spread of homemade goodies, is in-
cluded in the price of a room. The
proprietors take great pride in mak-
ing their guests as comfortable in
their home as they themselves.

that hard, I should work for myself,’’
said Thronber

She decided she wanted to own a
bed and breakfast guest home. She
set about looking for a suitable house,
discovering Lexington through in-
vestigating a house ad in ‘‘Mid-
Atlantic Country Magazine.” The
house she chose, even the way she’s
decorated it, all add to the guests
comfort.

The home that is now Llewellyn
Lodge was once a tourist home, so
Thornber didn’t have to do any major
renovations. Each bedroom already
had a bathroom and there is a park-
ing lot in the back.

Thornber has decorated the home
in “‘livable’’ furniture. There is a
dove gray sectional sofa in the living
room. All the bedrooms have roomy
beds. There are a few antiques and
knick-knacks here and there. The ef-
fect is tasteful decorations that are
durable—visitors won't mess up the
aesthetic quality of the room by sit-
ting down init.

Most of the guest of Llewellyn
Lodge are parents of students at
nearby VMI or W&L . ‘‘When I have
the parents here, particularly of the
VMI boys, they can come over, sit
down here, and it’s not like sitting in
a motel room. In the winter they can

 

 

 

Llewellyn Lodge

One Lexington hostess, Ellen
Thornber of Llewellyn Lodge,
created her business with the com-
fort of the visitors in mind, and even
her own lifestyle caters to her guests,
with her visitors winning out over
privacy.

“If they want to sit down here and
talk, that’s fine. I always welcome
them to sit down here. Lots of times
they just want to be alone. I think
that you have to be very flexible in
this business.”

Llewellyn Lodge, in the heart of
Lexington, has the destinction of be-
ing the area’s first bed and
breakfast. The half-century old
home offers five bedrooms, prices
varying from $35 to $65.

Thornber came to the Lexington
area two years ago looking for houses
to convert to a bed and breakfast.
She had spent 20 years in the
hospitality business, working for
airlines and travel agencies. Thorn-
ber was working 16 hour days as a
hostess in a restaurant in D.C. that
catered to ‘‘the White House crowd.”

‘‘! decided if I was going to work

sit by the fireplace and it’s like being
ina home, and they really like that.”’

Thornber helps her guests with din-
ner reservations and suggests things
to do and see in the area. Her fiance
even takes guests fishing occasional-
ly.
“T am flexible. I let people do what
they want, and they feel at home.”’

Just outside of Lexington is Pat
and Jim Tichenor’s Fassifern. The
Tichenors, who have become good
friends of Ellen Thornber, cater their
business toward a different crowd
than Llewellyn Lodge does.

Most of their guests are older
travelers, parents of local college
students, or members of the military.
The Tichenors do not accept children
under 16 in their bed and breakfast.
There are too many valuable, easily
breakable antiques, and _as Pat says,
“there is really nothing for a child to
do here.”

Fassifern, a large manor house
built in 1864, offers six rooms, most
with private baths, for $35 to $55.
Each of the rooms is decorated under
a theme ranging from the simple

The Tichenors add many special
touches to their business. Pat has
made many of the quilts which top
the beds. Jim’s sand and driftwood
candles grace the dining room man-
tle. They are eager to offer you hors
d’ourvre and some conversation in
the evening.

The house is decorated with anti-

ques and artifacts collected during

Jim’s tour in the military. Ask about
the masks from Jim’s tour of Africa,
or their collection of antique guns
(one from Saudi Arabia features a
butt made from a monkey’s skull. )

The Tichenors spent over 25 years
moving about the world while Jim
served in the military. They dream-
ed about running an inn when Jim
retired, but when the couple was sta-
tioned in Hampton, they began to
search actively for just the right
home.

“‘We looked at close to 100 houses in
two years and put about 20 or 30 thou-
sand miles on the car,” said Pat.

The couple discovered Lexington
when they stopped for the night dur-
ing a trip hunting for houses in West
Virginia. Later, like Ellen Thornber
of Llewellyn Lodge, they saw an ad
for a home in the Lexington area in
“Mid-Atlantic Country Magazine.”’
That home is now Fassifern Bed and
Breakfast.

The Tichenors had to do major
renovations to get the home ready.
They moved in May of 1986 and work-
ed night and day to get it ready for an
August opening (they already had
reservations). Additional bathrooms,
refinished floors, and improved
plumbing and wiring are the results
of their efforts.

Fassifern is a five-minute drive
from Lexington, just this side of the
new Virginia Horse Center.

Slightly farther away, a 15-minute
drive, is Baleony Downs, run by
Catherine Clayton. The 185-year-old
white plantation house is five miles
south of nearby Buena Vista.

The two-story frame house backs
up against the Blue Ridge Parkway.
Beside the manor house is a small
airstrip, punctuated by a_blaze-
orange windsock. An immense brick
barn, the heavy fallen timbers of tis
roof visible through the arches of its
windows, sits beside the home.
Squatting in front of the barn is the
plantation’s stone icehouse, looking
much like a Scottish shepherd’s cot-
tage.

Mrs. Clayton is a transplanted

ried an American during the war and
they came to Rockbridge County in
the 1950s. When her husband left her
several years ago, Mrs. Clayton went
to work as a desk clerk for the Lex-
ington Historic Inns. She loved inn-
keeping so much that she decided she
wanted to go into the business for
herself.

Her son, who is an airline pilot, of-
fered to buy a home for her as a per-
sonal investment. Mrs. Clayton
knew just what home she wanted.
She had been friends with the owners
for several years and loved Balcony
Downs.

She has plans for her bed and
breakfast. Right now two bedrooms
are available to be rented, both on
the second story. One has a private
bath and features a large brass bed
and working fireplace. The other has
a reproduction “South Carolina rice
bed,’’ a high bed of dark, handcarved
wood.

A third bedroom, over the
breakfast area, is being renovated.
Once probably used as the servants’
quarters, it is reached by steep, nar-
row steps. The sloped ceiling with
exposéd beams and small windows at
floor level remind Mrs. Clayton of a
ship’s cabin. She plans to decorate it
in a nautical theme.

Mrs. Clayton hopes to turn the
brick barn into a restaurant and
youth hotel. The stone icehouse will
someday be the honeymoon cottage.

Most of the furniture is the Clayton
family’s. The only new things the
bed and breakfast required were
large beds.

“T was pleased to see that my fur-
nishings fit the house almost perfect-
ly. The mantle (in the breakfast
room) was the perfect place to put
my antique pewter collection. One
cupboard in the living room fit an
alcove by the center fireplace with
only an inch to spare.”’

She says she is not in the bed and
breakfast business to get rich, but
hopes to eventually generate enough
money to pay for the costs of the
business.

She charges between $30 and $50
per night fora room. ‘“‘I think people
should have a nice place to stay
without having to pay a lot of
money.”

Balcony Downs, which opened just
this January, gets its customers
mainly from local colleges and

visitors’ center referrals. Mrs.

Clayton says many of her guests
have said they heard about Balcony
Downs from other travelers while

 

many hikers—Balcony Downs is just
down the mountain from the Ap-
palachian Trail.

Another bed and breakfast off the
beaten path is Osceola Mills Inn in
Steele’s Tavern, about a 20-minute
drive north of Lexington.

Its owners, Paul and Kathy
Newcomb, like the Tichenors, con-
ducted a search for the perfect place
for a bed and breakfast. The couple,
at that time living in Grand Rapids,
Michigan, came up with a set

business is so they could work at
home in order to spend more time
with their two young sons. The fami-
ly feels their closeness adds to tie
homey atmosphere of the inn. ;

‘We're doing this to raise our fami-
ly, so it is our living,”’ said Katity
Newcomb, adding that they try {0
“keep the homey flavor that we want
to maintain, because that’s what
staying in an inn is, sharing some-
one’s home.” :

of criteria for their new business.
They looked up and down the East
Coast and as far west as Missouri to
fit their requirements.

The site they decided on was an
1849 mill that includes a miller’s
home. Until 1969, the mill produced
products under the ‘‘Flavo’’ label.

The mill and manor house needed
major renovations. Although the
mill had been used as a home, both
the plumbing and wiring needed an
overhaul, and the third floor, which
had not been touched since the mill
closed, was still full of corncobs and
almost eight years of grime.

The three story slate-blue mill now
houses four guest rooms, living
quarters for the Newcomb family,
and a dining room where breakfast
and dinner are served. The
Newcombs added a private bath for
each room. The manor house, now
gutted, is being replastered. The
family also plans to get the mill
wheel running again with the year.

*
to accommodate youngsters. Finding
durable furniture that fit the
period of the historic mill was a pro-
blem. The mill is decorated with
reasonably priced reproductions.
The family sells the furniture, using
their bed and breakfast as 4a
showroom and supplementing their

income in the meantime. :

If you would rather not be around
children, the Newcombs can still ac,
commodate. They plan to make the
manor house exclusively for adults,
featuring antique furniture and a,
music room.

‘

Outside, there is a swimming pool,
beside the mill to keep kids of all ages
occupied. Or guests can fish or wader
in the nearby Marl Creek. Kathy,
Newcomb also fixes guests picnic
lunches (‘‘grinders, of course’’) fore
guests going on hiking trips or
visiting nearby historic sites, such as*
Monticello or Ash Lawn. .

Osceola Mills Inn also features a
honeymoon cottage with a whirlpool
spa by a huge stone fireplace. The
building used to be the mill store.

Unlike many bed and breakfasts,
Osceola Mills Inn welcomes children.

- Women’s Center adopts historical names

Staff Reporter

 

The Women’s Center Advisory
Board has renamed the Women’s
Center after two historical women at
Washington and Lee University—
agg Childe Lee and Mary Custis

“We wanted to name the rooms
after someone historical,’ said
Meredith Walker, chairperson of the
board and manager of the center.

Walker sought the help of Mary
Coulling, author of ‘‘The Lee Girls’,
for suggestions concerning the name.
Coulling felt the names would be ap-

propriate for the two rooms in the
center because of their involvement
while living on the campus, said
Walker

The room used as a study room is
named for Mary Custis Lee, while the
room used as a television room is
named for Mildred Childe Lee. The
entire center has been renamed the
Arlington Women’s Center, said
Walker.

Walker said the decision to use Ar!-
ington for the name of the center was
appropriate since that was where the
women were born and grew up. The
board felt it tied the women together,
she said.

Coulling said the women were very
involved in the activities on the cam-
pus for the five years that their

‘Three Sisters’ play to open
Saturday parents weekend

aaa enema ee eel
By Abb Jones
Staff Reporter

 

Production of the W&L Drama
Department's first play of the 1987-88
school year is expected to be com-

', pleted in time to kick off Parents’
_ Weekend.

Professor Al Gordon, head of the

_ W&L Fine Arts Department, is direc-

ting ‘The Three Sisters,’’ a 4-act play
by Russian playwright Anton

’ Chekov.

Set in 19th century Russian, The

, Three Sisters is about the inability of
_ three well-educated sisters to control
_ their own lives during the militaristic

period prior to the Bolshevik Revolu-
tion.

“It’s also about the decline of
genteel society before the revolu-

’ tion,’”’ said Gordon.

Gordon said he chose to do the play
for several reasons.

“(The drama department] tries to
hit all the periods over a certain time

’* span,”’ he said, ‘‘and we hadn’t done

this [period] in a while. Most of the
people in the play are young and I

~ wanted the students to have lots of

parts. And another thing is that

- everybody has a group part. No one

person has a dominant part.”

The three sisters are being played
by junior Delia Ford, a drama major

  
      
 

 

         
     
     
   
       
   
  

from Atlanta, and freshmen Tait

North of Great Falls, Va. and Gena
Woolner, of Vienna, Va.

The two other major characters,
Andre, the brother of the three
sisters, and his wife Natasha, are be-
ing played by freshman Harry Pen-
ner, of Hellerup, Denmark, and
Monica Burke, a drama major from
Yardley, Pa.

Admidst the hammering and saw-
ing going on around the set, Gordon
says he is optimistic about opening
night.

“The actors are doing well and the
set is doing well,’”’ he said. ‘“‘Opening
night will be a big turnout due to the
parents, but of course, we want the
students to come too.”

Gordon added that there would pro-
bably be a substantial turnout frum
the Sweet Briar Drama Department
since they are also currently produc-
ing ‘“The Three Sisters.’’ Gordon said
Southern Seminary College had plan-
ned to produce the play but had a
change in plans.

Other works by Chekov include
“The Cherry Orchard,’’ ‘“‘Sea Gull”
and “Uncle Vanya.”’.

Opening night for the play will be
Friday, October 31 at 8 p.m., with a
matinee to be ormed at 3 p.m.
Saturday. The play will then run
November 4-7. Reservations can be
made by calling 463 :

father was president of the universi-
ty

She said Mary Lee was born in 1835
and Mildred Lee was born in 1846.
Coulling felt that since the women
were born before the Civil War and
lived into the 20th century, ‘they
would be the model type people”’ the
advisory board was looking for.

Walker said the center was design-
ed for the use of all W&L women
which includes undergraduate and
law students, as well as the faculty
and staff and their guests.

She said the Arlington Center can
be accessed 24 hours a day, but after
11 p.m. the outside entrance facing
Washington Street will be locked and
the center can be entered by the side
stairway in the University Center.

The study room will have reserved

quiet hours from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.
Sunday through Thursday, but the
television room will be available 24
hours a day. It may be reserved by a
woman for the maximum of four
hours and must be done through a
reservation/liability form, which can
be done through Carol Calkins in the
University Center, she said.

Alcohol is not permitted at any
time in the center. This rule is in ac-
cordance with the alcohol policy of
the university, she said.

Walker said the center is to be used
by the women, but they may invite
men as guests.

“This is a place for women to go
and hang out. It was created to pro-
vide the women with a place they
could call their own,”’ said Walker.

Football’s losing streak is now

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

For the second week in a row, the
Washington and Lee football
Generals hit the road. And, for the
second week in a row, the Generals
were trounced.

Playing in the University of the
South’s Homecoming game _ in
Sewanee, Tenn., the Generals gave
up 24 points in the first half of their
way to a 38-13 blowout and their third
loss in as many games.

‘We just weren’t able to execute on
offense,” said W&L head coach Gary
Fallon, ‘‘and defensively we just
weren’t able to contain them and
keep them off the scoreboard.”

Just as they did on Oct. 17 against
Hampden-Sydney, the Generals gave

up three touchdowns before putting
any points on the scoreboard. The
Tigers scored twice in the first
quarter, on a one-yard run by
tailback Jock Craig and on a 15-yard
pass from quarterback
Bobby. Morales to. slot-back Greg
Glover. Craig picked up his second
touchdown of the day on a three-yard
carry with 9:11 left in the second
quarter. Morales added all three ex-
tra points.

The Generals scored their first
points more than 22 minutes into the
game on a pass from sophomore
quarterback Phil Sampson to senior
tight end Gar Prebor. Freshman
Carter Quayle added the extra point
to make the score 21-7 with 7: 15 left in
the first half.

The Tigers answered back with a

‘Easy competition’ is blown
away by the men’s squad

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

The Washington and Lee men’s
cross country team literally cruised
to easy victories over Bridgewater
and West Virginia Tech last Saturday
on the General’s home course.

The women’s cross country team
also picked up a relatively easy win
when it downed West Virginia Tech.

The score showed that W&L finish-
ed with 15 points, followed by
Bridgewater with 49, and then West
Virginia Tech which scored 71. The
meet, however, was even more lop-
sided than the score.

“It was an easy meet for us, in the
sense of competition,’’ said head
coach Dick Miller.

Easy, indeed. The Generals took
command on the first lap of the race
with freshman Larry Pilkey, senior
co-captain Scott Rippeon, junior Bill
Clark and senior Richard Moore run-
ning as a group and distancing them-
selves from the rest of the pack.
W&L, now 5-2 on the season, never
looked back and the race was pretty
much over by the first-mile mark.

“We ran well together and we pro-
bably ran as well as a team as we’ve
run all year,”’ said Miller. ‘‘It does in-
dicate that we’re rounding into pretty
good shape and starting to work to-
gether.”

seconds left in the half, making the
score 24-7 at the intermission.

The third quarter was much more
balanced than the first half. The
Tigers struck first on a 27-yard run
by Craig with just over seven
minutes left in the period, but the
Generals responded with a 13-yard
pass from Sampson to senior slot
back John Roe. Quayle missed the
extra point, so the score was 31-13
with 3:14 remaining in the third
period.

Sewanee’s Craig recorded his
fourth TD of the day of the day less
than two minutes into the fourth
quarter. Morales’ fifth extra point of
the day ended the scoring and gave
the Tigers a 38-13 victory.

Looking at the game as a whole,
Fallon was very impressed with the
play of Morales. Fallon said the fifth-

game day, those Bridgewater people
really want to get after W&L. We've
seen performers on their team not
play so well in other games, and then,

all of a sudden, they come up against
us and they’re supermen.”’

The Eagles run a Winged-T offense
led by a four-year veteran at quarter-
back, senior Jim DeLucas (6-0, 170).
A native of Woodbury, New Jersey,
DeLucas has completed 39 of 78
passes for the Eagles this season.

Bridgewater's leading ball carrier
is sophomore fullback Anthony
Lawrence (5-9, 175), who averages
more than 120 yards per game. Cur-
rently the number-two rusher in the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference,
Lawrence has gained 852 yards on 173
carries this season. ‘‘He can score
from any place on the field,” said

Fallon. ‘‘We’re going to have to real-
ly work at containing Lawrence.”

The Bridgewater defense is an-
chored by senior tackle Mark Saun-
ders (5-10, 230), a two-time all-ODAC
performer, ‘‘Mark is our best football
player, there is no doubt about it,”’
said head coach Dan Antolik. ‘I
don’t think there is a coach in our
conference who wouldn’t want him in
their starting lineup.”’

The Bridgewater defense will also
feature the Eagles’ leading tackler
from 1986, junior linebacker Mark
Wheeler (6-1, 190). The Buena Vista
native was an all-State performer
while at Parry McCluer High School.

Rippeon finished first in a time of
28:34 over tne 8-Kilometer course and
he was followed by four, count’em
four W&L runners to complete the
wipeout. Clark came in second in
28:34 with Moore (29:54), Pilkey
(30:30) and senior co-captain Rick
Norris (30:31) close on his heels.
Miller was especially pleased with
the performance of Norris.

“Rick's picking up and moving up
a little bit,’’ he said, ‘‘and moving
closer to Larry. They were basically
running against themselves. Rick
and Larry worked very closely on
Bridgewater’s No. 1 man and he fell
behind them on the third mile.”’

The women’s team, 2-2, truthfully
were running against themselves, as
runners from the other schools were
no-shows and Tech was only able to
field a single runner. Freshman
Paige Cason broke her own school
record for the second time, finishing
the 5-K course in 23:56. The day,
however, was more of a workout for
the Generals than a competitive
race.

Both teams enjoy their third-
consecutive weekend on the friendly
hills and turns of W&L’s home course
on Saturday. The men compete
against Hampden-Sydney and
Eastern Mennonite at 11:45 a.m. with
the women taking on Lynchburg and
Eastern Mennonite in the earlier
race at 11:00 a.m.

Freshman Paige Cason breaks her own school record for the

second time on Saturday.

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee foot-
ball Generals lost two starting
players to injuries during a intra-
squad scrimmage at halftime of
Saturday’s game against the
University of the South.

Junior center Rowan Taylor
broke his leg and will be out for
the rest of the season. He is ex-
pected to return to Lexington to-
day after a five-night stay in a
Tennessee hospital. Senior
linebacker Chris Jerussi suffered
a sprained knee. According to
head football coach Gary Fallon,
Jerussi is expected to practice
Wednesday and will be able to
play this weekend against
Bridgewater.

Trailing 24-7 at halftime, Fallon
said his players weren’t executing
on either side of the football.

‘‘We weren’t tackling, we were
grabbing at people,’ said the
W&L head coach. ‘We just
weren’t playing aggressive
defense. Offensively, we were
coming up with an effort, but we
just weren’t blocking with ag-
gressiveness,”’ said Fallon.

“‘Sometimes, you have to give
credit to the opponent for making
things happen, but it just looked
like we were falling down in our
basic tackling and blocking, our
fundamentals.”’

Fallon said he was optimistic
going into the game about the size
and skill of the Sewanee team and

 

players was the only reason for

 

 

‘Rowan Taylor

expected the score to be close
throughout the afternoon. Conse-
quently, he was very surprised by
the Tigers’ 17-point lead at the end
of the first half.

“T thought, ‘I’ve got to do
something to instill some ag-
gressiveness in these youngsters,
to get their intensity up...’ We’re
still in the ball game, I feel, [and]
I’ve got to do something to shake
the cobwebs out of our players’
heads and get them playing with
aggressiveness. I went to
something that I’ve used in the
past: to line up in the end zone
and go back to the basics of good,
aggressive blocking and ag-
gressive tackling.”’

Fallon said motivating his

Men drop two straight to
Johns Hopkins and Tigers

 

By Gary McCullough
Staff Reporter

 

After obtaining two victories last
week to even up its season record at
5-5, the Washington and Lee men’s
soccer team dropped back down to
5-7 with losses to Johns Hopkins
University and Hampden-Sydney
College. The General’s Old Dominion
Athletic Conference record now
stands at 3-2.

Last Sunday, the Generals traveled
to Johns Hopkins for another tight
defensive struggle. Hopkins was only
able to score one goal the entire
game, but that was all it took to sur-
pass W&L and come away with a 1-0
victory.

Yesterday afternoon the Tigers
journeyed over from Hampden-
Sydney to challenge W&L on Smith
Field. H-S scored early in the game,
but sophomores Patrick Brown and

Scott Levitt teamed up to put the
Generals back on top 2-1. That score
remained until tne last minute of the
game when H-S floated one into the
back of the net to send the game into
overtime with a tie score of 2-2. H-S
was able to score once more in the
first part of the overtime and the
Tigers held on for a 3-2 victory.

As junior goalie Sheldon Clark
pointed out after the game, ‘‘It was a
really lopsided one.’’ Without the ap-
pearance of the deceiving score-
board, a stranger passing through
would have seen nothing but General
aggressiveness and dominating play.

Sophomore Jeff Caggiano agreed.
“We were outplaying them the entire
game,” he said. ‘‘There’s no reason
why we should have lost to them.”

W&L will face Millersville Univer-
sity at home on Smith Field at 3:00
p.m. this Saturday for Parent’s
Weekend.

 

Second guessing; not a good call

 

Shades on sports
By Mike Shady

 

 

 

Sports Editor

 

 

It’s easy to second guess someone. You already have the results and
the course of actions taken to obtain those results. All you have to do is
sit back and point out what you would have done differently and how
things would have turned out for the better. Yep, it’s so easy, perhaps
too easy, to second guess someone.

I’m not going to second guess what Washington and Lee head foot-
ball coach Gary Fallon did last Saturday against the University of the
South. Fallon was unhappy with his team’s intensity during the first
half, so instead of going back to the locker room and talking things
over, he kept his team on the field and had an intra-squad scrimmage.

The results were tragic, with junior center Rowan Taylor breaking
his leg and senior linebacker Chris Jerrusi suffering an injury that
kept him out for the second half. The Sewanee fans were laughing at
the Generals—probably thinking our whole football program was a
joke. Instead of firing up his squad, Fallon possibly threw away any
shred of team morale still left for W&L. It was, all in all, an ugly scene.

But what was the intent of Fallon when he kept his players on the
field? Was he trying to humiliate them? Was it some morbid attempt
on his part to embarass the University and the athletes representing
this school? I don’t think so. Fallon was there to win a football game,
and he was doing all that he could to get his team fired up and play
good football. Hell, the Generals were still in the ballgame, only trail-
ing 24-7. With quarterback Phil Sampson and an excellent corps of
receivers, a spread of 17 points is not an insurmountable lead.

This is my third year at W&L, and I have known Gary Fallon since

my freshman year when I shot (and still do shoot) the video tape for
the away football games. I have nothing but admiration for Fallon and
what he has done for the W&L program. Since coming here in 1978,
Fallon has an overall record of 46-40 and had compiled six-consecutive
winning seasons before last year’s 2-7 disappointment. He obviously
knows how to coach.

He also knows how to handle young men. When I try to think of a
word to describe how the football players feel about their head coach,
“respect”’ alway comes to mind. Fallon is a true believer in the
philosophy of academics first and then athletics, with the goal of
molding every person into a scholar-athlete. His players have always
shown class, win or lose, and that comes from nowhere else but the
head coach.

Maybe Fallon made a mistake. Then again, maybe he didn’t. What
if the Generals had not had those injuries and won the football game?
Fallon would have looked like a genius. Who’s to say what is the right
or wrong way to do something?

I didn’t agree with Fallon’s decision on Saturday. I would have done
things differently. Looking back, Fallon himself has apologized for
what happened and said that perhaps he made a mistake. Hey, we are
all human beings and we all make mistakes. It’s so simple to play
Monday morning quarterback. However, sometimes we aren't:
qualified to make that second guess.

NOTES—Please, I beg of thee to go out and support all the W&L.

Take the rents along and have a good time... Is instant replay going to

Giants. They could conceivably win the rest of their games and give
the Chicago Bears a run for their money. Remember, you heard it

Soccer teams are beaten

Women end season with loss
to Hollins but look to next year

 

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

 

Although the Hollins playoff game
on Tuesday ended in a loss for
Washington and Lee, the women’s
soccer team is not evaluating its
season performance on the basis of
that one match. Head coach Janine
Hathorn thinks the Generals had a
“winning season,’ choosing to focus
more on the effort and improvement
of the team rather than its 2-8-3 final
record.

The Randolph-Macon Women’s
College contest last Saturday was
W&L’s last match of the regular
season, and the game proved to be an
impressive 4-0 victory for the
Generals. Two goals were scored by
sophomore Catherine Baillio, who
also had two assists, and sophomore
Joelle Jackson and junior Alexa
Salzman each had one goal apiece.
This was the first time W&L had a
chance to play strong offense. As
Hathorn observed, the team “‘learn-
ed how to really work with one
another and make goals.”’ Hathorn
considered this to have been a very
satisfying game since W&L was
finally able to effectively execute its
method of offensive play.

The Hollins game, however, was
frustrating. After a 43 lead at
halftime, W&L lost 6-4. Scoring for
the Generals were junior Catherine
Christian, Jackson and Baillio—who
finished the season as W&L’s top
scorer. The scoring rebounded
throughout the first half, but the
Generals again encountered difficul-

or its football team, because these
young men mean a great deal to
me.”’

Fallon said ‘‘the last thing I
ever wanted’’ was for someone to
get hurt. “I’m very sorry that had
to happen, and I apologize for the
whole situation. I certainly feel

badly about the two young men
who were injured.”

Given the same situation and
the same results, Fallon said ‘“‘I
probably would not make that

ty sustaining strength in the second
half. Hathorn subbed players for the
defense, which was not competing up
to its usual standard. This move
restored some defensive control yet
failed to help the team offensively.

The team had other crippling fac-
tors to overcome. The sweeper, soph-
omore Beth Stutzmnn, suffered a
broken collar bone in the game
against Lynchburg on Oct. 21, and
her contributions were greatly miss-
ed. Also, the R-M game had not been
defensively challenging and, there-
fore, it did not serve as advantageous
preparation for the game against
Hollins.

“We're inexperienced enough so
that it’s difficult to adapt day-to-
day,’’ Hathorn said.

The team was pleased about com-
peting in an Old Dominion Athletic
Conference post-season game,
though, and thought that, according
to Hathorn, ‘‘winning would have
been the icing on the cake, so the loss
does not matter except that, given
the halftime score, we really should
not have been defeated.”

Hathorn is anxious for next year’s
season and anticipates success. She
is optimistic about adding more team
members.

“T hope that the notoriety of our
spirit and respectable playing will
draft the women soccer players here
who were hesitant to try out because
they weren’t sure of what to expect. I
think we’ve shown them, as well as
everyone else, that this team is
serious and talented, and it is
realistic to have high expectations
for next year,”’ she said.

halftime.’’ But, if the inuries had
not occurred, Fallon said if the
Generals ‘“‘did go out there and
play with more intensity [in the
third quarter], I probably would
make the same decision, if I felt
that was needed.”

Summing up the events of
halftime, the tenth-year head
coach said, “‘By no means did I
want our young men to get hurt or
to be embarrassed, or to embar-
rass our university. And if that
did occur in people’s minds, then I
owe them an apology, because
W&L means a great deal to me. I
respect our student body, and I
certainly respect our football
team.”’

Macabre’s All

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

For some strange, unexplained
reason, every one of us has a fraction
of our psyche that enjoys being
frightened, shocked, and_ totally
disgusted. I mean it’s not as if wat-
ching someone be butterflyed (Julia
Childs style) or eating pancreas is
normal behavior. It’s not. It’s weird
and it’s scary; but people have the
need.

Every since Robert Wiene directed
The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari in 1919,
horror movies have been a favorite of
movie-goers around the world. In
1931, the genre broke wide open with
the premier of Frankenstein starring
Boris Karloff and Dracula starring
Bela Lugosi. Other stars such as
Claude Rains and Charles Laughton
created immortal roles as the Invisi-
ble Man and the Hunchback of Notre
Dame, while Lon Chaney Jr. was
becoming ‘‘The Man of 1,000 Faces.”’

The 40’s and 50’s brought King
Kong, Godzilla, Megalon, and the
Shrimp who ate Japan, but as each
monster was sent to the cardboard,
rubber cemented Tokyo model in the
sky, horror movies lost more and
more of their ‘“‘artistic’’ elements and
became vehicles for gore and
violence in the 70’s and 80’s.

But hey, you've got to change with
the times, right? Well, technically,
and financially, the unfortunate
answer is yes. Everyone wants to
know why there have been six Friday
the 13th movies. Answer: the
original was made for roughly
$170,000, and as of last year, had
grossed over $17 million. It’s basic
math—you figure it out.

Enough griping though. The truth
of the matter is that nine of the top
ten monster/scary/horror films of all
time have come since 1973. Some are
gross, many are disgusting, most are

Ragin’ at the Girls’ Schools - What a Rush

By Marshall Boswell
and Richard Moore
Staff Reporters

 

Yes, there are women now at
Washington & Lee, and the world did
not end; and by the look of the crowds
at the Co-op this year, it seems to me
that the overwhelming majority of
men on this campus (of which I con-
sider myself a member) are perfect-
ly happy with the arrangement. But
guys (and this article is, admittedly,
primarily for the men), let us not
forget that there are also women’s
colleges—no less than five—
surrounding our little idyllic
academic community here. And
where there are women’s colleges,
there are Security Guards. And
where there are Security Guards,
there is fun to be had!

If you are wondering what I am
talking about, then you are obviously
new to W&L, and, consequently, the
women’s colleges as well. That is to
say, you have never participated in
that hallowed W&L tradition (which,
thankfully, still persists) known as
Dorm Raging.

Ah yes. Tell me, is there a more
frothy blend of euphoria and fear
than that produced by running
gleefully across the Hollins College
quad at 1:30 in the morning with a
Security Guard in hot pursuit? Sure-
ly not. Dorm Raging is NOT an art,
though; rather, it is a sport, and
since all sports have guidelines, ob-
jectives, rules and equipment, I think
it is high time those pertinent to
Dorm Raging were put down in print
once and for all.

thrilling. All are excellent.
without further ado, here are the
Tug’s Tag, Top Ten Horror films of
all time.

10. Frankenstein (1931, Dir. James
Whale)

Even though Frankenstein is not
that scary by today’s standards, it
has to make the list because of its in-
fluence on the horror genre. Boris
Karloff’s performance still ranks as
one of the finest in horror, and is no
question the finest performance of
the Frankenstein character to date.
Frankenstein is a classic and a perfect
example of what monster movies us-
ed to be. It’s just a good flick.

9. The Shining (1980, Dir. Stanley
Kubrick)

It’s good that The Shining can be in-
cluded because it kills two birds with
one stone. Stephen King and Stanley
Kubrick are both masters of what
they do. King makes a living out of
horrifying people with his novels,
while Kubrick shocks people with his
creations on film. The Shining brings
them together and the result is terri-
fying. Jack Nicholson is wonderful
as always as the hotel keeper gone
bananas. His ‘“‘Heeerrre’s Johnny”
scene with Shelley Duvall will
forever be a horror classic.

8. The Omen (1976, Dir. Richard
Donner)

The Omen was terrifying because
of the subject it dealt with. Come on,
the anti-christ is nothing to joke
about. And how about the name of
the kid; Damien? What? Did his
parents not like him or something.
Even today, how many people have
you met named Damien that you
didn’t raise your eyebrow at? That’s
what I thought. The feverish, roller
coaster intensity in the film is ex-
celient. The scene on the tricycle is a
horror classic.

7. Psycho (1960, Dir. Alfred Hit-
cheock)

What can be said about Psycho. It’s

Every true Rager’s raison d’etre,
his reason for existence, is the
Security Guard (known from here on
out as the S.G.). The objectives to
Raging, then, are two-fold: the
Rager must first get the attention of
an S.G.; next he must induce the S.G.
into pursuit; and lastly, he must
escape the S.G. in whatever legal
manner the Rager sees fit.

Now we must examine the proper
Raging attitude and costume.

As for attitude, spontaneity is the
key. The fun of Raging consists in
large part to following the Indiana
Jones maxim (a great Rager in his
own right, by the way) of, ‘‘I’m mak-
ing this up as I go along.’”’ There is
frequently no time to pre-plan where
one is going to run to, and so it is im-
perative that one be able to make the
most of whatever comes one’s way
(ie. bushes, fire-escapes, fences,
creeks, fire extinguishers, etc.). It
goes without saying that a pleasant
alcohol-induced buzz helps this
along, but be sure not to drink so as to
hinder Escape Ability (known
heretofore as one’s E.A.).

But what does one wear?

Well, running shoes are para-
mount. Loafers and top-siders might
look nice, but they are definitely ar
E.A. liability. Comfortable, loose fit-
ting pants are also important, as
one does not want to wear clothes
that might collect water or hinder
one’s ability to scale fire-escapes
three steps at a time (an indispen-
sable Raging skill). Sunglasses aid
in concealing identity, particularly
when one encounters an S.G. from a
previous night’s Raging. And lastly,

been scaring audiences for 25 years
and it will continue to as long as it is
watched. Hitchcock was the master
of suspenseful films and could turn us
inside out like no director before his
death or after. All of his films are ex-
cellent and wonderful to watch at
Halloween. Watch The Birds and see
if you don’t check the sky when you
go outside.

6. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984,
Dir. Wes Craven)

“One, Two, Freddy’s comin’ for
you.’ Though Wes Craven hasn't
made a film worth anything other
than this one, 4 Nightmare on Elm
Street is destined to become a horror
classic. There is no question that the
film succeeds due to the development
of moden special effects, but it is
still quite good and incredibly scary.
Relatively intelligent story line in
comparison to most.

5. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre
(1974, Dir. Tobe Hooper)

For some reason, this film has
reached cult status among horror
fans. I wouldn’t be surprised at all in
fact, to find out that there is a
Leatherface fan club some where in
the United States. Nevertheless,
Texas Chainsaw is quite scary and will
make you cringe. Please do not
watch the meathook scene on halluci-
nogens.

4. Jaws (Dir. Steven Spielberg)

Though many people do not con-
sider this film a horror movie, it is.
In fact, Jaws is one of the best horror
movies you will ever see. If you can
find me a scarier monster than a
hungry, 2,000 pound great white
shark, let me know. Richard
Dreyfuss and Roy Scheider give ex-
cellent performances. The real
awards though, should go to the
special effects crew who made Jaws
the reality that it is on screen. Had
they not brought the shark out of the
water when Quint is killed, no one
would have ever known that the

one should always carry a wrench
(for easy sign reversal i.e. Wile E.
Coyote) and a Swiss army knife (in
case one finds oneself hungry in the
suburbs and in need of a little

vegetable-garden nourishment.

Just as sports teams have arenas
in which they prefer, for one reason
or another, to compete, so does the
true Rager have his own hierarchical
preference for womens colleges. So
let us examine the Raging Top Five.

At the top of the list is Hollins Col-
lege. Put simply, Tinker and Tinker
Creek provide a marvelous challenge
for any advanced Rager. One can
run wildly away from Tinker with a
sweating, two hundred and thirty
pound S.G. who’s chock full o’ Dunkin
Donuts, bound through the woods, in-
to or over Tinker Creek (‘‘Make it up
as you go along,” as Indiana Jones
sez) and finally onto the equestrian
course, where S.G. ditching is made
easy. Other exciting obstacles in-
clude low-lying electric cow fences,
lots of farm country, and a Kroger
shopping center (for the serious
Rager).

Second on the list is Sweet Briar.
Perhaps nothing is more satisfying to
the experienced Rager than roaring
past the occupied S.G. station with
several water balloons and watching
said S.G.’s startled expression when
he is doused mysteriously by this
speeding automobile. Pure bliss.

Randolph-Macon presents an in-
teresting problem. The school, as a
rule, does not tolerate Ragers, and
many of the girls there seem willing
and eager to assist the S.G.s in any

shark was a model.

3. Alien (1979, Dir. Ridley Scott)

“In space, no one can hear you
scream.’ Well that doesn’t work in
the theatre, does it? Many will argue
original is much more _ intense
because you don’t know what’s com-
ing. Like Jaws, the special effects
crew of Alien deserves awards and
praise. The monster they created
was not only frightening, but very
real. This film will bring you out of
your seat.

2. Halloween
Carpenter)

The other cult classic in the top ten.
John Carpenter is considered one of
the finest horror directors in the_in-
dustry today. In fact, his new film,
Prince of Darkness, could be destined
for the top ten. However,
Carpenter's tour de force is
Halloween. It is always in the top
three of all-time horror lists and
justifiably so. There are few things
scarier than a psychopathic killer
coming after you. This film is in-
credible, and were it not for one other
film, would be the scariest film ever
made.

1. The Exorcist (1973, Dir. William
Friedkin)

The Exorcist is the scariest film
ever made, no question. Ever since
its release, this film has been terrify-
ing audiences to the point that they
have turned the film off, left the
theatre, or slept with a gun under
their bed for three months. Linda
Blair’s Regan has got to be one of the
seariest individual characters to
ever appear on screen. Her Oscar-
nominated performance is excellent.
What can you say? The anti-christ is
just a terrifying subject and under
good direction, became a terrifying
film. Watch The Exorcist, but don't
watch it alone.

There they are. My choices for the
Top Ten horror films of all time.
Have a safe and Happy Halloween!

(1978, Dir. John

way possible. What this means, of
course, is that one is faced, virtually,
with an entire school of S.G.s. So you
can see the appeal in this.

Mary Baldwin’s rolling hills allow
S.G. pursuit to start at the bottom
