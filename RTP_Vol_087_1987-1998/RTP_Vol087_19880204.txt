WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

Tom Wolfe entertains
standing room crowd

 

By Marie Dunne
Co-Editor

 

Tom Wolfe, Class of ’51 and a
member of the Board of Trustees
spoke last Thursday evening to a stan-
ding-room-only crowd in Evans Din-
ing Hall.

The speech, which was billed as
‘‘An Evening with Tom Wolfe,”
covered subjects ranging from the
challenge of writing fiction to new
trends of the times.

When Wolfe began college at
W&L, he said he felt as though he
needed to gain “‘riveting’’ experiences
if he was to-one day become a writer.
He recalls being jealous of one student
who had served several years in com-
bat because that student had so much
more experience than Wolfe did.

“The idea by the time I reached
Washington and Lee was that you
were going to write a realistic novel
based on your personal experiences, ””
said Wolfe.

‘*The idea was that you would reach
down your gullet, pull up your en-
trails, spread them out before the
world and become famous ever
after.”

This idea was popular at the time
‘*because it had been the great glory
of American literature.’’ During the
1930s, Sinclair Lewis won the Nobel

Prize for Literature for Babbitt, a
story about a real estate salesman
from Chicago. All the world-
recognized writers of the time wrote
about ‘‘very common ordinary
things,”’ said Wolfe.

While at W&L, Wolfe took part ina
creative writing class that met weekly
at the Dutch Inn.

**Every Wednesday night you had
to produce something and then you
read whatever you had done aloud to
the class. It could be a very painful
experience,”’ said Wolfe. Out of the
class of 10, three went on to become
published writers, a fact that says
something about the literary climate of
W&L, said Wolfe.

After graduating from W&L, Wolfe

worked as a reporter for newspapers,
including The Washington Post and
The New York Herald Tribune.

‘*The idea was that you would go to
work for a newspaper. You would
somehow work some of the fat off
your prose style, some of the fat off of
your soul. Gain some experience, and
at some point down the line you would
quit the newspaper business cold,”’
said Wolfe.

‘*You would move into a shack
somewhere, work day and night for
six months, after which you would
suddenly light up the sky with your
first novel.”’

At its meeting last weekend, the
W&L Board of Trustees approved in-
creases in tuition and fees for the
1988-89 academic year, according to
University President and board mem-
ber John D. Wilson.

The Board also nominated two new
trustees, William Lemon and Steven
Miles.

Tuition will increase to $8,900 for
next year, an increase of seven per-
cent from this year’s $8,300. Addi-
tionally, rates for rooms in University
housing have also risen from an aver-
age of $1,383 this year to an average
of $1,445 for 1988-89, a 4.5 percent

increase, said Wilson.

The cost of the 20-meal contract in
the dining hall rose to $1,980 from
this year’s $1,925, an increase of 3
percent.

The student activity fee will be $105
in 1988-89, compared to the current
$100. The Board approved the in-
crease with the recommendation of the
EC.

The Board also voted to increase the
financial aid budget, specifically the
W&L grant budget, by 10 percent.
The 1988-89 financial aid budget will
be $2,752,000, as compared to this
year’s $2,528,000, said Wilson.

The tuition and financial aid budget
must be approved at the winter meet-
ing so that Admissions may inform
prospective students, said Wilson.

At its winter meeting, the Board
mapped out a rough budget for the
University. The final budget will be
approved at the May meeting.

Among some of the items projected
for the final budget include increases
in salaries for the faculty and staff.

Additionally, the Board approved
funding for four new members of the
faculty. One position for a Japanese
instructor, one for a Russian instruc-
tor; and two positions in the music de-
partment were approved.

One of the new professors in the
music department will replace Profes-
sor Robert Stewart, who will retire at
the end of the year. The other music
instructor will ‘‘help provide contin-
ued leadership for the Rockbridge
Symphony Orchestra, ‘‘ said Wilson.

The board also nominated two new
members. William Lemon and Steven
Miles were appointed and will be
sworn in at the Board meeting in May.

The faculty has voted to take the
InterFraternity Council out of the rush
scheduling process.

At their regular monthly meeting on
Monday, the Faculty gave the Student
Affairs Committee the authority to set
up next year’s rush calendar.

Almost certain to be included in the
SAC calendar will be a deferred
pledgeship until the beginning of win-
ter term, a grade requirement of 1.9
for pledging, and a requirement that
the freshmen be initiated by the end of
the eighth week of the winter term,
said IFC President Mark Farley.

“‘I am generally pleased with the
outcome. In my opinion the faculty ac-
tion could have resulted in a January
rush, which would have been much
worse,’ Farley said.

“*However, some of the faculty ex-
pressed views that disturbed me. A
minority of the faculty appear to be
seeking an environment that I believe
is not possible as long as fraternities
exist.

“This is in sharp contrast with the
views expressed to me by the Board of
Trustees, the president of the univer-
sity, and his administration, all of
whom have been extremely suppor-

tive.

News Director Brian Shaw throws

 

By Heidi Read
Staff Reporter

 

Brian D. Shaw, director of the
News Office at W&L, is seeking a
seat on the Lexington City Council.

Shaw said it has always been some-
thing he has wanted to do. He added
that he is not dissatisfied with the cur-
rent City Council.

However, he said ‘‘I’d like to be in
that role [of a councilman] because I
want to make a difference in the Lex-
ington community.’’ Shaw said since
there was a vacancy, he would take
advantage of it.

Shaw grew up in Greensboro, N.C.
He received a B.A. in English from
the University of North Carolina at
Greensboro. Upon graduating from
UNC-G, Shaw went to work for the
Greensboro News and Record. He
worked at various papers in North
Carolina, Kentucky and Virginia be-
fore coming to Lexington in 1981 as

Shenandoah Bureau chief for the
Roanoke Times & World News.

In 1983 Shaw joined the family
business, Star Food Marts, Inc. and
then re-joined the Greensboro News
and Record in 1985. He remained in
that position until August of that year,
when he was named director of the
News Office at W&L, the position he
currently hoids.

Many of the activities Shaw is local-
ly involved in are relevant to some of
the issues he thinks are important to
the City Council.

For the past two years Shaw has
directed the junior division of the
Maury River Soccer Club, and last
year served as a co- coach in Lexing-
ton Youth Basketball League. He said
a city recreation program is impor-
tant.

‘It helps to involve people within
the community,’’ Shaw said. ‘‘Lex-
ington used to be known for its recrea-
tion programs back in the 1960s,’” he
said.

‘Different newspapers wrote re-
views of how Lexington’s recreation
programs should be copied, but now

not as many programs have contin-
ued.’’

A major issue Shaw stressed was
the consolidation of schools and
government. ‘*Lexington [and its sur-
rounding areas] have three different
forms of government,’’ he said, ‘‘It is
wasteful in an area of 30,000 people to
have three different systems.”

® Shaw said Lexington has very little
income because about 56 percent of its
lands is non-taxable. These lands are
held by the two universities in town,
W&L and VMI. Shaw said the city
needs to support a downtown de-
velopment to bring in more income.

He said adding a few hotels or inns
in the downtown area would help to
generate income. A possible location
for a hotel could be across from the
Hunter & Huntress on Randolph
Street, Shaw said. Since most of the
hotels and motels are outside the city,
Lexington is deprived of much-needed
income. Shaw said a similar situation
applies to businesses.

schools and government would en-

- City Council zoning proposal endangers student housing

 

By Alan Greeter
Staff Reporter

 

W&L student housing faces major
ramifications tonight when Lexington
City Council is expected to vote on the
definition of a family for zoning pur-
poses within the city.

The controversial subject has raised
debate between advocates of student
housing within the city, and those
supporting lower ind middle income
residents of Lexington, who feel in-
vaded by the influx of student resi-
dents in their neighborhoods.

The present city »rdinance defining
a family only allow: for two unrelated
individuals to live ir @ Single dwelling
home as a family.

Although this ordnance has not
been enforced in the vast, individuals

supporting low and moderate income
citizens at the Jan. 21 council meeting
recommended that the present ordin-
ance be enforced before another one
was even considered.

Advocates for lower income hous-
ing stated that landlords have been
purchasing housing for student needs
rather than family needs.

Lexington landlord William Stearns
said, ‘‘a majority of my tenants are
students, and I have not had any real
problems with them.”’

Stearns, who owns approximately
40 rental units in the Lexington com-
munity, supports the definition pro-
posed by the Social and Economic
Services Committee allowing four un-
related individuals to live in a single
dwelling unit, with possible condi-
tional use permits for dwellings with
up to eight individuals.

In order for these permits to be is-
sued the dwelling must provide a se-
parate bedroom for each individual
living in the building, and the house
must meet other minimum building
codes.

Another problem that Stearns said
was of importance in this matter was
the problems surrounding _ noise,
trash, and parking.

*‘In order to receive the conditional
use permits we are going to be re-
quired to set high standards, and if the
students have a problem complying
with the standards I will have to evict
them,”’ Stearns said.

Stearns also thinks that the amnesty
period allowing property owners to
comply with the new ordinance be 10
years rather than the 2-year period
recommended in the committee’s re-
port

The committee had originally pro-
posed a 10-year amnesty period but
revised that time period afier oppo-
sition from low income residents.

Besides the report from the Social
and Economic Services Committee,
the minority report signed by Coun-
cilman A.C. Jordan will be considered'
by the council. Jordan’s report asks
for the definition of a family to remain
at two unrelated individuals, and for
the amnesty period to last until June
30, 1989.

If the council decides to accept the
proposal outlined in the minority re-
port, many W&L students might be
forced to find housing outside of the
Lexington community.

Assistant Dean of Students and Re-
sident Housing Kenneth P. Ruscio
said there are currently more applica-
tions for student housing than can be

filled.

‘“‘Capacity in Gaines Hall is be-
tween 230-240, and at this time we
have more than 300 applications,”’
Ruscio said. Ruscio also expects
Woods Creek Apartments to be filled
with both law students and undergra-
duates.

Although Ruscio said he expects
some of the students to withdraw their
applications for University housing,
he does believe a decision limiting the
number of unrelated individuals to
only two would have serious implica-
tions on student housing.

The five-member Social and Econ
omic Services Committee is also look-
ing at the possibility of establishing a
housing authority to handle the in
creasing housing problems.

omics Business Partnership Founda-

A group of board members have
agreed to create a list of financial
plans to help fund the Fraternity
House Renovation Project. The Board
was presented with a report from
architects on the projected costs of
renovating each fraternity house.

“(The report] gives a very large,
crude idea of what would be involved,
but it gives us enough to go on to try to
develop a financing option,‘‘ said
Wilson.

that would benefit everyone,’’ Shaw
said. According to him, a more inte-
grated system among government,
schools and business would help to al-
leviate costs, encourage more coop-
eration and promote unity among Lex-
ingtonians.

Other activities Shaw is involved in
include being president of the Rock-
bridge unit of the American Cancer
Society and being a member of the
Lexington Rotary Club. He served as
spokesman for Citizens for the Repeal
of the Blue Law, a group that worked
successfully last year to permit Sun-
day shopping in Lexington and Rock-
bridge County.

Shaw has also handled the public re-
lations for the Rockbridge Christmas
Basket Program and the Tasters
Choice benefit for the Yellow Brick
Road Day Care Center. For the last
two years Shaw and his wife, Cheryl,
have organized the Fourth of July
children’s parade in downtown Lex-
ington,

Shaw added, ‘‘If elected, I will
work very hard, for, whatever is good
for the area, is good for Lexington.”’

OPINION

 

The road to Hell
is paved with

good intentions

At its most recent meeting the faculty told the Student Affairs
Committee to create a rush calendar without the input of the Inter-
Fraternity Council. While the SAC has always held that power,
they have usually allowed the IFC to develop a calendar and then to
submit it to the SAC for approval. This year, the SAC will create a
calendar that will most likely be completely different from the one
developed by the IFC. The proposed SAC calendar would delay the
start of pledgeship until the beginning of winter term, establish a
minimum GPA of 1.9 before pledging, and require initiation of
pledges by the end of the eighth week of winter term. Additionally,
the new calendar will stay in effect until the university completes a
self-study sometime in the early 1990s. We feel there are several
serious problems with the proposal.

First, even though SAC was never required to consult with the
IFC, it was an act of good faith that it did. In general, rush this year
went very smoothly. The majority of the houses responded to the
SAC’s gesture by obeying the rush rules the fraternities had a hand
in creating. To bypass the IFC is to ignore the people who are most
knowledgeable about how a fraternity works. The faculty is not fa-
miliar will the intricacies of running a fraternity. To allow them to
decide without the input of the fraternities which rush calendar
would work best would be similar to allowing the students to decide
the curriculum. Neither group has the expertise to make the best de-
cisions.

Second, the new rush schedule will be in effect until the univer-
sity completes it’s self-study on all aspects of the university, includ-
ing a specific section on ‘‘all facets of the freshman year.’’ The uni-
versity plans to complete the study sometime in the early 1990s.
This means that, for at least two years, the students will have no in-
put into the rush calendar. If the study is delayed, the students will
be excluded even longer. Two years!? It took less than six months
to complete the Iran-Contra report. Certainly the Congress’ report
was no less comprehensive than the university’s study.

Third, the minimum GPA requirement, while an excellent idea,
is unfair. For the university as a whole, freshmen go on academic
probation only when their GPA is less than 1.5. Even if they fall be-
low that level they still may participate in one extra-curricular acti-
vity. Under the SAC proposal any freshman who falls below a 1.9
will not be allowed to pledge. Why is the requirement for fraterni-
ties so much more strict than for the university as a whole? Does
pledging a fraternity really take any more time than participating in
athletics or singing in the university chorus? © © =

Fourth, the eight week pledge program is far too short. Admitte-
dly the current pledge program is too long, but there has to be some
compromise. Most fraternities require their pledges to pass an exam
before initiation. Does the faculty really believe that shortening the
pledge program will make the academic pressure on the freshmen
less intense? Instead of pledgeship being spread out over seven
months the SAC proposal will cram it into eight weeks. That seems
to guarantee increased strain on the freshmen. Twelve or fifteen
weeks is much more realistic. The programs would still be shor-
tened from their current inflated length but the freshmen would
have more time to complete the necessary preparations for initia-
tion. ‘

Finally, it seems that every year the faculty expects more and
more concessions from the fraternities. At first the requests were
reasonable. In light of the new liability laws the changes were
necessary. Now, the faculty, swelled with their past successes, has
decided to try to force fraternities into the background. Last year
the houses conceded a shorter rush and stricter alcohol regulations
because the faculty implied it would not press for further re-
strictions if the allowances were made. Overall, rush went very
well this past year. The majority of the houses followed the new
rules and those that didn’t were punished. Now the faculty wants
stricter rules. Where does it stop? Will the faculty eventually want
to decide which freshmen pledge which house?

The SAC proposal, while some of its intentions are good, is
dangerously misguided. We approve of the faculty’s attempts to
improve the fraternity system. However, the new proposals are un-
just and harmful to both fraternities and freshmen. The faculty is
endangering something that has been an important part of W&L for
over 125 years.

Wall Street

induces
reaction

SURNAMES UR Aimee eRe
MY VIEW
By Kathy Morrison

 

I certainly wish I'd waited until bar-
gain night to see Wall Street. Though I
do not consider myself a professional
movie reviewer, I do feel qualified to
attest to the accuracy of the following
quick summary:

Yuck.

I usually try to find at least a little
merit in even the worst of films--I
managed to sit through Bruce Willis’
Blind Date once--but' I was sorely
tempted to walk out on Wall Street.
The acting in the tough-guy trading
scenes was artificial at best; these
guys talked about stocks like Stallone
talks about blowing up Commies, ex-
cept with more four-letter words and
enough C-school terminology to make
an econ-major’s head swim. As if eu-
logizing a day on the phone selling
stock wasn’t bad enough, the audience
is also subjected to intermittent bouts
of father-son bonding that would make
even the most hardened dewy-eyed,
bleeding-heart moviephile feel like
retching.

Though the casting was probably
the least of many evils found in Wall
Street, the characters were unbearably
implausible.,.maybe because of their
unbelievable situations. Nevertheless,
Martin Sheen could have done a lot
more with his admittedly poor role.
The obvious fact that the father-and-
son- in-real-life didn’t quite come off
for the father-and-son-in-the- movie
was perhaps one of the most dis-
appointing aspects of the film. Charlie
Sheen wasn’t too convincing as the
good-boy-turned- bad-turned-good-
again, but he did have the pasty
dough-boy complexion one might ex-
pect young blossoming brokers to

haye.

Though it was difficult to sort the
good guys from the bad guys (not, by
the way, because of any cleverness in
the development but rather because of
twisted moral statements and a ten-
uous coherency) Michael Douglas as
Gekko at least looked like the slime-
ball he portrayed. Darryl Hannah
was...well, Darryl Hannah. The most
convincing performance during this
hour-and-a-half of hell was given by
Gekko’s fat son Rudy, who appeared
once and acted just like a three-year-
old.

The most annoying aspect of this
miserable flick aside from the charac-
ters themselves was what these char-
acters said. It’s entirely possible to
lose sleep over such trite maxims and
mini- moral lessons as ‘‘You know,
sometimes money makes you do
things you don’t want to.”’ This and
other Earth-shaking spiritual and
economic revelations were spouted
from the mouth of Hal Holbrook’s
largely forgettable character. The ac-
tion wasn’t much better than the dia-
logue, complete with the obligatory
sex-and- drugs-in-a-limo scene, the
collage of dirty under-handed trading
scenes and continual ludicrous at-
tempts to put energy into the dreary
concept of buying and selling stocks
with other people’s money.

The fatal error inherent in Wall
Street is the assumption that the depic-
tion of such business as exciting, her-
oic, even noble is enough to carry the
entire movie. It may be that the aver-
age cinema-lover, a businessman him-
self, will find the depiction flattering
and even interesting; however, to the
non-business oriented, this approach
to an otherwise deathly boring reality
cannot work without proper attention
to the human aspect of the movie.
People watch movies in order to be en-
tertained--what entertains the most is,
in my opinion, watching other people.
Wall Street stresses the money, how
it’s won and lost, its power and its
price...but at no time does one feel
anything concerning the characters
but a slight frustration. No matter how
hard one might try to like the good
guy and hate the bad guy, it just
doesn’t happen and disappointment
results.

Indeed, it is hard to say which of the
manifold emetic aspects of this film
deserves to be called the worst; the
rancid denouement, the forced
schmaltz, the crippled attempt at mak-
ing a statement, the graphics right out
of 1973, the lame, lifeless characters,
etc., etc. To borrow a phrase from
Siskel and Ebert, even the plot itself
was ‘turgid, sour and ugly.’’ Perhaps
the creators of Wall Street intended to
appeal to the current wave of yuppie-
dom, but I doubt this film holds appeal
even for the indiscriminate tastes of
the young middle class.

Writer urges formation of
non-smoking section in Co-op

i ie eee
MY VIEW

By Margaret Pimblett

 

It’s time to add more fuel to the fire of
dispute about how to improve the
University Co-op/Bookstore atea. I’-
ve heard enough about the need for
quicker service, lower prices, better
food, more junk food, less junk food,
a wider variety of food, thicker milk-
shakes, hotter French fries and mea-
tier hamburgers. Now let’s talk about
what’s really important--the health of
those students and faculty members
who frequent the co-op for breakfast,
lunch or snacks. No, I’m not talking
about the dangers of co-op hot dogs.
As far as I can tell, they’re not only
safe to eat, but marginally tasty as
well. Just be sure to shake up the ket-
chup before you put in on--and ponder
carefully the chili dilemma.

The issue at hand is the need for a
non-smoking area in the university
snack bar. Wait!! Hold on, all you
readers who have just screamed,
‘‘There’s not enough space in there
now!!! If you make a non-smoking
area we'll never have room to sit
down! **You see, I’ve already thought
of that. Yes, the co-op needs more
seating space, but I doubt any current
students will see such room mate-
rialize while they are still undergra-
duates. We'll just have to work
around that problem.

that we are not subsidized by the University in any
way. The only school- related funds that we were
granted include $500 received through petition to

I also understand that a good num-
ber of students, if not a majority of
students, are cigarette smokers. I’m
not about to tell anyone that they
should not be allowed to smoke in the
co-op.

However, (and this is a big
“*however‘‘), there are also a number
of non-smoking students and faculty
who patronize the co-op. Why should
those people be forced to smell ciga-
rette smoke while they are attempting
to enjoy a delectable co-op luncheon,
served with a smile by the wonderful
ladies and gentlemen who work there?

Of course, some of the non-smokers
would choose to sit with smokers. I
know I do, if I’m eating lunch with
friends who smoke. I certainly do not
think I have the right to tell them over
the pleasure of less polluted air. I
would continue to occasionally sit
with smoking friends in a smoking
area if my friends were to be unable to
eat a meal without smoking. But the
issue of whether non-smoking areas
are necessary in public places has
been argued for years. California has
outlawed smoking on all airline flights
originating or ending in the state that
are longer than two hours in duration.
Restaurants throughout the country
have tables set aside for those who do
not smoke. It’s time the co-op had
some area set aside, as well.

The problem, as I’ve already pro-
posed, is where to put a non-smoking
area. Let’s dwell on that point for a
moment. We would most likely want
the smoking area away from the food
preparation area, simply for sanitary
health reasons. We also have to have a
proper ratio of smoking seats to
non-smoking seats. I realize this is

We deeply regret that our only two social func- '
tions, proposed with the intent of providing a
social alternative for the undergraduate women,
have met with such resistance and negative feed- ’
back. However, it is heartening to receive such
enthusiastic response from those who have parti-
cipated. A special thank you goes to all whose
time and efforts made the ‘‘Winter Slosh‘* possi-
ble, in addition to all those who supported our

Starting to sound like’an airline, but
bear with me.

As the co-op is now arranged, there
are 24 seats in the small room on the
east side of the building, toward the
Lee-Jackson House.

Three booths are available along the
wall in front of the short-order
counter, because the fourth booth is ,
reserved for employee breaks.

Five more booths are situated along’
the wall on the other side of the double’
entrance doors.

*

And approximately 25 seats are,
available at the tables in the remainder
of the coop area. :

If the small room and the three”
booths were set aside for non-+
smokers, I figure 36 seats would be
available (with four people at each
booth). ’

By the same measure, 45 seats’
would be available for smokers. ‘

I think the 36-45 ratio is a legitimate ,
figure for non-smokers to smokers
who patronize the Co-op. :

But my individual view, as it is, will ‘
not a non-smoking area make. I’ve,
talked to the manager of the co-op,
Richard Armstrong, about the idea, |

‘Liberty Hill’ property

 

By Alice Harrell
Staff Reporter

 

Recently a new piece of property
came into W&L’s possession. Perhaps
not many people were aware that the
area near Liberty Hall was not entirely
owned by the University—not until
late last November, when the money
to buy the land was donated by two
W&L alumni, according to Frank
Parsons, executive assistant to the
president.

The piece of property includes a red
brick house near Route 60, and the
immediate area surrounding it. The
house was first built by Dr. H.L. Mit-
chell in 1941. Later it came into the
hands of Joseph Niekirk, who has re-
sided there for many years, said Par-
sons.

Niekirk, now retired, is a former
executive director of the VMI Founda-
tion, an agency that raises money for
VMI through alumni support.

When Niekirk received word that a
place for him was available in a re-
tirement home in Lynchburg where he
had been think about moving, the an-
nouncement arrived unexpectedly and

he saw that he would have to dispose
of the property quickly. He offered it
to W&L on a first-refusal basis.

Parsons saw this offer would be a
worthwhile investment. He stated the
importance of the property lay in its
values as ‘*...a historic site...and a
frequently used entry to back cam-
pus.

Parsons also mentioned how toler-
ant Niekirk had been with regard to all
the traffic past his house as people
drive by for athletic events or fes-
tivities held at the Pavilion, and added
that a good rapport had always been
maintained between Niekirk and the
school concerning his house’s location
surrounded by W&L property.

Another owner might not have been
as cooperative as the Niekirks, and
Parsons added, there would have been
no guarantee that the place would have
been kept up as well as it has been if
someone totally new were to move in.

Parsons made a presentation to the
Board of Trustees, and as a result, the
land was purchased from Niekirk by
the school with the help of a generous
donation from two alumni who had at-
tended the meeting.

According to Farris Hotchkiss, Se-
cretary of the Board of Trustees, a gift

of $25,000 is still needed to complete
the funding, and will presumably be
provided by a third donor. Until then,
the first two donors wish to remain
anonymous.

Since this was the only portion of
that land on the ridge that was not ow-
ned by W&L, Parsons felt that the
land would serve well in development
interests.

WA&L recently bought this house and property near Liberty Hall.

The house may become the resi-
dence of a dean, or it would serve as
an ideal place to hold alumni social
events, as there is more than enough
parking space for the numerous
alumni who come to such functions
every year.

Whatever the use of ‘‘Liberty Hill’’
(as the Niekirks called it) turns out to
be, it is certainly a welcome addition
to the campus, said Parsons.

Visiting black instructor to join faculty

 

By Rob MacPherson
Staff Reporter

 

An undetermined department at
W&L will have a visiting black facul-
ty member next year as part of the
university’s new ABD teaching pro-
gram.

The program, whose name stands
for ‘‘All But Dissertation,’’ will give
a black graduate student who has met
all doctoral requirements except for
the completion of his or her disserta-
tion, an opportunity to teach one or
two courses and experience life as a
faculty member of a four-year liberal
arts college.

In addition, the individual will be
expected to complete his or her disser-
tation, said John Elrod, dean of the
college.

The individual will be considered a
member of the faculty and will have
the opportunity to become involved in
all faculty matters, Elrod said. Upon
completion of the dissertation, the in-
dividual will become a candidate for
any job vacancies at W&L for which
he or she is qualified to fill, the dean
said.

Elrod wrote to what he called the
‘eight major graduate teaching insti-
tutions in the Mid-atlantic and South-
eastern regions of the United States’’
in search of interested candidates. He
said all but one school replied and he
saw that as encouraging.

All of the respondent’s names were
placed in a pool and the university is
currently narrowing down the candi-
dates, Elrod said.

According to the dean, a candidate’s
area of study will not have a bearing
on the university’s decision.

“‘We’re going to choose the most
talented candidate in the pool,’’ Elrod
said.

The decision will be made by the
dean in conjunction with the depart-
ment to which the candidate will be
assigned. The chosen candidate will
visit W&L and meet with members of
the faculty.

vElrod said the ABD program, as
opposed to normal hiring procedures,
will enable the university to find a
black potential faculty member much
more easily. He said it is important for

W&L to have a black faculty member
and, because there are so few black
doctoral candidates, the ABD pro-
gram will give the university a head
Start.

Naturally, once the chosen candi-
date completes his or her dissertation,
he or she will no longer qualify for the
program. However, Elrod said he
hopes the individual chosen for the
program will learn whether or not he
or she would like to teach at a school
like W&L.

“If they seek employment at a four-
year liberal arts school and we have an
opening, they will be considered,’’ he
said. Le

In addition to the ABD. sélection,
the university will have a_ visiting
black professor from Hobart College
next winter term.

Lawyer stresses balance between career and family

 

By Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

Mary Natkin, the Director of the
Legal Writing Program at W&L’s
School of Law, spoke to a group of
women and one man on the topic of
‘‘Women in Law: One Woman’s
Perspective.’’ Her lecture on Jan. 28
was a part of the opening ceremonies
for the Arlington Women’s Center.

Natkin, who is also an associate of
law at the law firm of Natkin, Heslep,
and Natkin, focused on the problems
of balancing a career and a family.
She said that women suffer from the
‘‘problem of burnout and the super-
woman complex.’

‘*You’re not used to being unable to
handle it all. All throughout high

school, college, and law school, you
have succeeded.’’ She explained that
“‘in big city firms such as New York
and Atlanta, 40 hours a week is a part-
time work week, while 60 to 80 hours
is average.”’

She indicated that law firms are rec-
ognizing women’s need to work part-
time and desire to send their children
to day care close to the office. For ex-
ample, although it is not a law firm,
*‘Dominion Bank in Roanoke has an
on-site day care center. The producti-
vity is up and absenteeism is down.”’

Now that women are working part-
time, a few new problems have sur-
faced. One side effect of part-time sta-
tus Natkin mentioned is ‘‘the fact that
women took part-time status for five
years comes up when [the senior
members] discuss partnership. This
isn’t good. Furthermore, in considera-
tion for families, law firms may hand

didn’t bet on it.”’

out less demanding cases. This hurts
the diversity of cases the women have
handled when their name comes up for
partnership consideration.”

**T had a problem with part-time be-
cause I was cramming a whole day’s
work load into 6 hours,”’ said Natkin.
**No one knows what the long-term
effects are but it is a positive step that
means that the firms are recognizing
the problem of balancing [work and
family.]”’

Another element she discussed was
equality for women in the law profes-
sion. As far as law school is concer-
ned, Natkin said, that ‘‘women com-
prise 47 percent of students in law
school nationwide, and, while it is
only 40 percent at W&L, they are
catching up.”’

“There have been no situations
where people have not wanted to talk

to me because I am a woman,”’ said
Natkin.

She was hired by one man because
he said, ‘“‘Every woman lawyer I
know is more prepared than any
male.’’ Natkin also said that other sen-
timents indicate that women are
dreaded by male lawyers in court be-
cause they are better prepared. She
suggested that the intense preparation
could be due to self-doubt and the de-
sire to prove competence.

She stressed to women, ‘‘The term,
working mother, is redundant. That
second job is a full-time job.”’

Natkins’ message was
clear—women can succeed in the law
profession, but they must learn to bal-
ance career and family. ‘‘I balance off
whether a child’s fever is 102 as op-
posed to how long a memo is that I
have to write. I just take it one day at a
time.”’

Students plan to revive

Southern Collegian

 

By Jennifer Bandrowski
Staff Reporter

 

‘From now on SEX is spelled
Southern Collegian...ask Harry.”’
These signs have been appearing all
over campus as a spoof on the just-as-
mysterious ‘*Ask Josh’’ posters.

The signs were posted by sopho-
mores R.J. Thomas and Greg Euston,
who are trying to revive Southern Col-
legian, a humor magazine that was
published at W&L for 99 years until it
folded in 1968.

Greg Euston first got the idea over
Thanksgiving break when his father, a
W&L alumnus (’65), ‘*...asked how
Harry Collegian was...I had to say
that they didn’t make it [Southern Col-
legian| anymore,’’ Euston said.

‘‘Harry Collegian was to Southern
Collegian what Alfred E. Newman is
to National Lampoon,’’ Thomas ex-
plained.

Euston described him as ‘‘over-
weight, underdressed, dirty, unsha-
ven, drunk, and carrying a large
church key.”’

‘After break, I went and looked in
some old issues and it was very
funny...1 thought it was a neat idea,’’
Euston said.

“‘And I thought that it was even
neater,’’ Thomas added.

The magazine ‘‘... began in 1869 as
a journal of academic activities around
the South, published here at Washing-
ton and Lee,’’ Thomas explained.
‘Over the following century, the Col-
legian’s format evolved from the
journal into a literary and finally, in
the mid-SOs into an all humor for-
mat.”’

The magazine circulated four times
a year at schools throughout the
South, and had contributing editors at
many nearby schools.

‘Every time that something good
came up, they used it,’’ Euston said.

member staff who hoped to contribute
cartoons, photos, short stories,
plays,...light literary stuff.’’

Major corporations, such as R.J.
Reynolds and Lifesavers candy, ad-
vertised in the Collegian. ‘‘In 1968 it
ran an ad for presidential candidate
Ronald Reagan, who was then running
as a Democrat,’’ Euston said.

Euston and Thomas have been
working on the project, ‘‘for about a
month now.’’ They submitted their
proposal to the Publications Board on
Monday, Jan. 24.

Euston said, ‘‘We have a Feb. 29
deadline to come up with a synopsis
explaining the types of articles and
stories, and how many people are
committed to work.’’ Currently they
have five prospective staff members.
‘*We need a cartoonist!’ Euston em-
phasized, ‘‘or at least an artist.””

They are hoping to have the first is-
sue of the renewed Southern Collegian
published by alumni weekend. ‘This
was chosen so we can give the maga-
zine to both alumni and students and
gain the popular support that we
need,’’ Thomas said.

Currently they are working on sell-
ing advertisements. They are also,
‘*...sending information to other
schools: the girls’ schools, Hampden-
Sydney, and VMI,”’ Euston said.

Thomas explained that the original
publication folded because of **...the
time period, they were worried about
it getting out of hand.”’

According to Euston, there had
been controversy over ‘‘...two frontal
nude shots in the next to last issue...
and a centerfold candid shot of an
orgy that was really a classical reli-
gious painting....but we're not going
to put that in.”’

“We're going to put out a good
magazine probably in good taste,”’
Thomas added.

in the revival of the Southern Colle-
gian should contact R.J. Thomas or

This plan rarely worked out, said
Wolfe, and, for the time being, he lost
interest in writing a novel. He became
interested in writing non-fiction in a
fictional style.

‘‘The interest for me had now be-
come the writing of non- fiction, and
particularly, the use of techniques that
had here- before used only in novels
and short stories.””

Wolfe said he first came up with the
idea in the late 1960s of writing a non-
fiction book similar to Vanity
Fair about New York.

This idea eventually evolved into
his first novel, The Bonfire of the Van-
ities.

One of the most difficult and unex-
pected problems of writing fiction for
Wolfe was keeping one step ahead of
reality.

‘‘The imagination of the novelist is
powerless before what we will see in
the paper tomorrow,’’ said Wolfe.

‘‘The idea is that we live in such a
bizarre period that there is no way that
a novelist, simply drawing upon his
own mind can keep up with the events
of real life all around us.”’

in the book because they had occurred
in real life. One scene in which the
main character is threatened by a gang
of teenagers had to be cut before it ap-
peared in the serial because Bernard
Goetz had been confronted with a
similar situation in reality.

Wolfe’s skills as a journalist helped
him to create an accurate and creadi-
ble novel. Zhe Bonfire of the Vanities
is about a stock broker who finds him-
self on trial when he is involved in a
hit and run accident in the Bronx.

In order to research the novel, Wo-
Ife went to Wall Street and witnessed
the goings-on of stock brokerages. He
sat in at the court proceedings in the
Bronx Courthouse. He sat with
prisoners in holding cells and visited
the roughest parts of New York City.

Wolfe said that his next literary
project will be a novel. ‘‘I must con-
fess that I now find the temptation to
do another novel overwhelming,’’ he
said.

“I don’t know what it will be about,
but I know it will be based upon re-
porting. I devoutly hope it will not
take the six years that The Bonfire of
the Vanities did because none of us
live that long.’’

Greg Morcroft, senior, ‘‘I person-
ally enjoyed it because I wanted Doug
Williams to have a good game, and he
did.”’

The Ring-tum Phi, February 4, 1988

 

 

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

The W&L basketball team did not
get a pleasant welcome when it
traveled to Danville, Va. to play
Averett College on Tuesday night.

“You can say this: the court was
small, the officiating was questiona-
ble, there were two starters who wer-
en’t really playing—one didn’t go on
the trip— and they shot 70 percent
from the floor,’’ said head coach
Verne Canfield. ‘‘But we got our butts
kicked. We got beat.”’

The Generals, 15-4, lost 84-70 as
Averett shot 69 percent from the

The W&L wreatiitig® ‘etn Neue a’
close match last night to Virginia State
in Doremus gymnasium.

The final score was 27-24 as the
Generals dropped the final two weight
classes by pins. W&L, on the strength
of three Va. State forfeits, had taken a
24-15 lead.

Saturday, at Longwood, Va., W&L
won one of three matches at the
Longwood Invitational. The Generals
beat Ferrum 59-0 as three W&L wres-
tlers won by pins: senior John Lowe at
134 Ibs.; junior Mark Robertson at
167 and junior Manoli Loupassi at
190. Senior Kevin McNamara won by
technical fall at 158.

W&L then lost to Virginia State (its
first match against State during the

' week) 31-14 and Norfolk State 24-18.

The Generals were led by two wres-
tlers who have overcome recent phy-
sical problems. McNamara, who just
recovered from a bout with the
chicken pox, won all three of his mat-
ches. Robertson, who has recovered

from a knee injury, also won all of

three of his bouts.

we just came up a little short, especial-

two points with a little over five
minutes remaining in the game before
it was outscored 19-7 the rest of the
way. Senior forward Gary Schott was
ill and did not travel and senior center
Harmon Harden was hampered
throughout the game by a stomach
virus.

Poor shooting also hampered the
Generals. Senior guard Steve Han-
cock, the team’s leading scorer, fin-
ished with only nine points on 4-13
shooting from the floor (0-5 from
3-point distance) and W&L as a team

Averett hands WA&L its fourth loss

17 points respectively.

The loss came three days after the
Generals destroyed Lynchburg 96-63
at the Warner Center on Saturday
night. That win put W&L at 7-3 in the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
(tied for second) and in good position
to finish in one of the top-four spots in
the final standings, earning home-
court advantage for the first round of
the ODAC tournament.

The Generals play host to Emory

game behind W&L in the conference,
tonight at 7:30 at the Warner Center.

Men swimmers sweep two meets

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

In terms of competition, the W&L
men’s swim team pretty much had the
weekend off last week. In terms of
breaking records, the Generals had a
field day.

Making its first road trip of the
season, W&L, 5-1, defeated Shepherd
56-39 and Gettysburg 94-54, but this
was not a trip in which the Generals
were especially concerned with the
Opposition.

Against Shepherd, W&L went with
a ‘‘protected’’ lineup, moving some of
its top swimmers to different events
and allowing other swimmers, who
hadn’t had as much competition, an
opportunity to participate. It was not a
meet in which the final outcome,

team-wise, was ever in jeopardy.

**We swam, we won the meet with
no problem,’’ said head coach Page
Remillard. ‘‘Guys got to swim
different events and, all in all, it was
just basically a ho-hummer. What was
nice is that it allowed a lot of new
people to swim.”’

The Gettysburg meet was not the
same story. The Generals decided to
liven things up and established five
pool records. The team records came
in the 200-yard medley relay
(1:40.99) and the 800-yard free relay
(7:27.82), and the individual records
came with sophomores Adam Morgan
in the 400-yard individual medley
(4:19.53), David Olson in the
100-yard backstroke and Shawn Cope-
land in the 100-yard breaststroke
(1:02.09). W&L alumnus John Hud-

son (78) already held two Gettysburg
pool records.

*“When we came in, the guys no-
ticed ([Gettysburg’s] new record
board,’ said Remillard, ‘‘and they
noticed that a W&L alum from °78,
John Hudson, held a couple of the re-
cords. Then they started looking at the
times and then they got a little bit ex-
cited and decided to go for a few.’’

‘**We work an awful lot on game
plans,’’ he continued. ‘‘Our game
plan was really good in respect to the
individuals. People swam their races
strategically sound. That’s something
we've worked on all season and I’m
really excited by that.’’

On Saturday, W&L will take on
William and Mary at 2:00 p.m. in Cy
Twombly Pool.

llinesses hurt women’s chances

 

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

 

Although the losses to Shepherd and
Gettysburg were disappointments for
the W&L women’s swim team, head
coach Page Remillard thought the
team’s timing could actually have
been advantageous. Considering the
women had to compete without three
important swimmers, they are proba-
bly fortunate to have been scheduled
against Shepherd and Gettysburg.
Even though Gettysburg has the best
record, it was a meet W&L could af-
ford to lose.

Remillard did not dwell on the
defeats. ‘‘It’s just the luck of the
draw. Last year we happened to be
lucky. Statistically, we know that al-
most everyone gets sick in the third

 

   

the right weekend strategically,’’ he
said.

Junior Elizabeth Miles and fresh-
man Kristen Wagner were ill and not
able to travel. Junior Nancy Whalen
competed in only one event. The re-
sults of the meets were Shepherd
63-30, and Gettysburg 98-57, but as-
sistant coach Liz McKnight was still
proud of the team’s performance.

‘“‘They swam extremely well in
tough circumstances. Besides the flu
absences, the pool at Shepherd was
non-regulation and ‘slow.’ So there
was even more for the women to
overcome,’ she said.

Two women in particular per-
formed well, producing Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference best times.
Freshman Rachelle Nock and Sharon
Coleman swam superior races in the

butterfly, respectively.

Despite these achievements, Remil-
lard thought the team did not swim
well at Shepherd. He attributed the
performance to a combination of ill-
ness and post-success syndrome.

If W&L swims better against Hol-
lins next Saturday, Remillard is opti-
mistic about a General’s victory.

McKnight also has faith in the team
and commented on the upcoming
ODAC championships.

“IT think we’ll swim well. It’s a very
strong team as a whole,”’ she said.

Remillard agrees with McKnight’s
assessment.

‘‘We can put pressure on Sweet
Briar [W&L’s main competitor] at the
championship. If everyone swims her
ultimate performance, Sweet Briar

Dancing for those whocan't

Krom Staff Reports

W&L will stage its tenth annual
Superdance to benefit the Muscular
Dystrophy Association Feb. 6 and 7 in
the Student Activities Pavilion. The
dance will begin at noon on Sat., Feb.
6, and finish at | a.m., Feb. 7.

Organizers of the 15-hour marathon
have set a goal of raising $30,000 for
MDA through the dance and related
activities, including the popular

pie-throwing events that feature mem-
bers of the W&L faculty and adminis-
tration as targets.

A year ago about 167 individuals
danced in the event, which raised
more than $33,152 for the Muscular
Dystrophy Association.

Superdance tri-chairmen, Greg
Knapp, Chuck Husting and Mike Her-
rin, anticipate that 300 dancers will
participate this year.

The dance will feature the live mu-
sic of the Convertibles, Red, Black
and Blue, The Suspects, Small Repu-
blic, and Green Eggs and Ham from
noon until 6 p.m. During the evening,
Waxing Poetics will play at 9 p.m.
and IBM at I! p.m. Dancers will soli-
cit pledges from individuals and or-
ganizations based on each hour dan-
ced.

Various prizes, including a grand

prize trip for two to Hilton Head for
eight days, will be awarded to the
dancers who receive the most pledges.

Spectators and those wishing to join
the marathon dancers are encouraged
to come to the Superdance. Admission
is $5 per person and is good for the en
tire event.

Further information about the
Superdance may be obtained by con-
tacting Fontanne Bostic at 463-8917.

Africanlmages step into another world

 

By Heidi Read
Staff Reporter

Walking into duPont Hall’s Images
of Africa exhibit is indeed a step into
another world. Woven blankets, car-
ved chairs, 18th century maps of the
Gold Coast of Africa and Ashanti
goldweights decorate the room.

The extensive collection belongs to
Fred L. Hadsel of Lexington, who
was a former U.S. ambassador to
Ghana. All the artifacts were either
collected by Hadsel or given to him by
various chiefs of tribes he visited
while living in Ghana.

Hadsel is currently on a tour of
Siberia, but will give a lecture about
his collection on Feb. 11 at 4 p.m. in
duPont Hall.

Each piece of the collection has a bit
of history written about it. The collec-

Pirandello drama to open
Friday at University Theatre

 

From Staff Reports

 

‘*Six Characters in Search of an Au-
thor,’ an early 20th- century play by
Luigi Pirandello, will be the next pre-
sentation by the University Theatre.
The play will run from Feb. 5 through
10, with performances at 8 p.m. each
day except Sunday, Feb. 7, which will
be a3 p.m. matinee performance.

This classic work has been referred
to as the first ‘‘modern’’ play, because
it deals with the exposure of theatrical
illusion and the puzzles of existence
and reality. It is often referred to in
discussions of existential and relativist
philosophy.

 

tion of Ashanti goldweights is exten-
sive. One particular weight was made
in the shape of Abraham Lincoin’s log
cabin to commemorate his birthday.
The American Embassy had a special
ceremony in honor of Lincoln’s birth-
day and the Ashantis acknowledged
his birthday with this small log cabin
goldweight.

Each household has its own set of
scales. Since the Ashantis never de-
veloped a smelting pot, each gold
piece had to be weighed individually.

Other tribes in Africa used clay
molds to form small statues from
metal. A repeated image is a bird fig-
ure with a long neck looking back-
ward. This is supposed to symbolize
that one doesn’t know where one is
going until one knows where One has
been.

Co-directed by Tom Ziegler and Al
Gordon, the play is set in a theatrical
rehearsal which is interrupted by the
instruction of six ‘‘characters’’ who
were created by an author but never
put into a finished work. When the
characters try to get the director and
actors to ‘‘create’’ their play, a debate
arises over the relative ‘‘reality’’ of
characters and actors. When he wrote
the play in 1921, Pirandello wanted
the audience to feel that, when they
entered the theatre, they had stumbled
into a rehearsal.

Reservations for ‘‘Six Characters in
Search of an Author’’ can be made by
calling the theatre office at 463-8637.

The women and children help pre-

imported from Italy and the finished
cloth is used to make the traditional
Somali clothes, none of which are ex-
ported.

Post-18th century Ethiopian reli-
gious books are also a part of the col-
lection. Illustrations in the books are
done by hand and the lettering resem-
bles Arabic. The books contain
psalms and hymns.

Other interesting artifacts include
incense burners, the smoke of which
Somali women use as their perfume.
Elaborately carved Ashanti stools are
used as symbols of power, position
and tradition by an Ashanti chief.
