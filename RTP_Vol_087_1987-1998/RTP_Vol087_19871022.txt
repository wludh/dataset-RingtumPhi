- Six freshman candidates campaign in run-off elections

 

By Abb Jones
‘Staff Reporter

“Although most of the candidates’

posters have come down and the
flyers have been thrown away, six of
the original 34 freshmen running for
office at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity have continued to campaign for
today’s run-off election.

Willard L. Dumas III and Walter
Scott narrowly edged out the other 13
candidates for the run-off for
Freshman Executive Committee

Representative. Dumas received 51
votes, just under 15 percent of the 352
votes cast, while Scott received 43
votes, just under 12 percent.

Dumas, a native of New Orleans,
La., and pledge at Sigma Chi frater-
nity, says he wants to do what he can
for the school.

“T believe in the honor system
here, and I really like W&L and I'd
like to do what I can for the school,”
he said.

Scott, a native of Memphis, Tenn.,
says his past experience with his high
school honor council has prepared

W&L student receives
an antigen overdose

 

By Sean Campbell

Staff Reporter

 

A W&L student accidently received
an overdose of his allergy antigen
medicine after both he and the
University Health Center nurse
misread the instructions provided by
the student’s allergist.

Scott Cornell, a sophomore
member of Sigma Nu social fraterni-
ty, began receiving medication for
allergies in June of this year. When
school started, he had the injection
administered by the University infir-
mary.

The mistake was made on Sept. 29
when Cornell was to begin receiving
his maintenance level injections.

“The treatment,’ Cornell explain-
ed, ‘“‘helps the body to gradually build
up a resistance to the allergies.”

He was being treated for allergies
to fall pollen, spring pollen and en-
vironmental mold.

Cornell said, “‘The injections start
highly diluted and gradually become
more concentrated until the body can
tolerate a level higher than in the ac-
tual environment. After reaching
that level the injections are con-
tinued for a maintenance period
which varies with each individual.”

The correct maintenance level
dosage for each of the three solutions
was .05 c.c. The actual amount in-
jected for each solution was .5 ¢.c.,

ten times the designated prescrip-
tion.

Cornell said, ‘‘The shot looked too
big. It was a little bit my fault.”

The head nurse, Josephine H. Mc-
Cown, R.N., and Cornell examined
the instructions form Dr. Dan §.
Sanders, III Cornell’s hometown
allergy physican.

“After the shot, my arm felt sore
and was swollen, but there were no
other immediate side reactions. I
took a nap after dinner and when a
fraternity brother woke me, I knew
something was wrong. I felt dizzy
and my face, throat and hands were
swolen.”’

Cornell was driven to the infirmary
and the nurse on duty gave him two
injections of adrenaline to counter
the reaction. He also was kept over-
night for observation.

University Physician, Dr. Robert
M. Pickral said, ‘The bottom line is
if another doctor gives medicine to a
patient then that patient is responsi-
ble for its administration. If that doc-
tor sends the medicine to another
doctor to admimster then the second
doctor becomes responsible.”

He said, ‘The infirmary is ad-
ministering these allergy shots as a
financial convenience to the
students. These students need to be
aware of the individual dosages.”

Cornell said, ‘It was stupid that I
didn’t say any thing, I just assumed
she knew what she was doing.”

him for this job.

“T have served for five years on my
high school honor council, and I en-
joyed the responsibility and dedica-
tion that the job required.”

Presidential candidates Tom
Spurgeon and Tom Hatcher received
a commanding majority of the votes
in their race, splitting 54 percent of
the vote. Spurgeon received 106
votes to Hatcher’s 85.

Spurgeon, a native of Muncie, Ind.,
was the only candidate of the six who
made the run-off that said the
freshman class meeting helped him a

great deal. The forum, which was
held in Lee Chapel last Thursday for
freshmen to meet the candidates,
allowed for each of the candidates to
give a one-minute speech.

“T felt that I could do a good job
and I felt our class deserves someone
who could do a good job,” said the
Phi Gamma Delta pledge.

Hatcher, a native of Bowling
Green, Ky., and pledge at Phi Kappa
Sigma fraternity, said that all

members of the freshman class are
leaders and therefore they deserve to
be well represented.

Three Buena Vista men were ar-
rested early Sunday morning and
charged with malicious wounding
after an attack on a W&L junior at a
fraternity party.

Pietro M. Petino, Jr., a member of
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, receiv-
ed a black eye and an injured finger
after three men pulled knives on him
at a Chi Psi party.

Michael W. Camden, 29, Thomas B.
Coleman, 22, and Robert W. Ward,
27, all of Buena Vista, were arraign-
ed in Lexington General District
Court Tuesday. Camden was also
charged with assault and battery of a
police officer. Their court date has
been set for Nov. 17.

Petino said he was helping Chi Psi
fraternity members in removing a
knife from one of the three men at the
house when the men allegedly
assaulted him on the front porch.

Chi Psi President Frank Rooney
said he had asked the men to leave
before the incident occurred, but the
three pulled knives on him. He said
he immediately called the police.

Mock Democratic Convention ’88 is expected to cost

 

By Peter Boatner
News Editor

 

The 1988 Mock Convention, W&L’s
traditional attempt to predict the
presidential candidate for the party
out of power, will cost an estimated
$136,000, according to MC treasurer
J.J. Buquet.

That number represents the total
estimated expenditures of the fifteen
sub-committees of the Convention’s
Steering Committee, which is coor-
dinating next March's big political
event.

Though much of that has already
been supplied, more than $76,000 will
have to be solicited from private
donations.

The biggest cost for the convention
will be the estimated $25,414 required
by the state delegations to conduct
their research and to represent
themselves at the convention.

All in all, more that 1300 delegates
will take part in the extensively plan-
ned exercise, in addition to numerous

visitors, returning alumni and
reporters from across the country.

Responsible for overseeing the
budget is Buquet, a senior from
Houma, La.

“We were very conservative in
estimating revenue, and very liberal
in estimating expense,’’ Buquet said
of the process.

“After combining the subcom-
mittee budgets, we sat down and re-
hashed them compared to 1984,” he
said. ‘‘We eliminated the overlaps,
and added a little or took away a lit-
tle.”

Total expenses in 1984 came to
$118,541, Buquet said. The 1984 Con-
vention even left about $2,000 to get
this year’s event under way.

The success of the convention
depends on the research done by the
state delegations. They are required
to contact the Democratic leadership
in their state, to poll voters and to
keep up on the local issues of con-
cern,

The costs incurred here include

newspaper subsciptions, and printing

day. We wonder if it should have appeared in the editorial section instead.

for letters and solicitations.

A not insignificant duty of each
delegation is to construct a float for
the big parade. This parade, a major
event in the city of Lexington, kicks
off the convention weekend and is a
source of intense rivalry between the
states for prizes.

The Parade Committee was al-
located $9,580 to make sure all goes
well on Friday afternoon. This
money will go to erecting stands, pro-
viding security, and hiring extra
entertainment.

The second biggest expense of the
convention will be the attracting of
prominent speakers to the event.
Over $19,000 will be spent attracting
preliminary and keynote speakers.
The Speakers Committee has
already brought candidate Jesse
Jackson to campus last spring, and
has attracted such luminaries as
Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, and
Harry Truman to past conventions.

Another major expense, and one
considered vital by most of the par-
ticipants, is the production of Mock
Convention memorabilia such as

hats, T-shirts and buttons.

No convention would be complete
without such enticements and though
the cost will be regained when the
items are sold at the convention, the
amount budgeted for their produc-
tion is $15,000.

Food Co-op offers more than natural foods

 

By Marie Dunne
Co-editor

 

 

 

The Rockbridge Food Co-op has
moved its old store on Randolph
Street to a larger location between
Sweet Things and Rockbridge Video
on Washington Street.

Manager Mirabai McLeod says the
larger store, which opens Nov. 9, will
allow the co-op to offer more types of
items to its customers, including
housewares, clothing and even
organic cosmetics.

The co-op is a non-profit group run
by its members. Members used to
pay an annual due, and in return got
a discount on anything they buy. In
order to raise the money needed to
move to the larger store, the mem-
bers decided to charge a one-time fee

of $96 dollars per adult for a lifetime
membership in the co-op. The fee,
which still entitles members to a dis
count, is refundable if a member
should move out of the area

Members can also work at the co
op to get an even larger discount

McLeod said all of the labor involved
in building shelves and the checkout
stand came from its members, with
the co-op providing the materials.

McLeod said using members as
employees works well.

“Tt really bothers me where I used
to work that there was one person
who never did any work, but made all
the money. We don’t have that
here,”’ she said.

The co-op used the $5,000 it raised
from its members to buy new com-
mercial refrigerators and freezers
for the 1200 square foot store, more
than twice the size of the previous
store. The co-op used residential
refrigerators at its Randolph Street
location.

The new store will also offer a
sandwich and juice bar. The bar will
be open for breakfast, offering
organic coffee, croissants, bagles,
and eggs. Lunch includes such items
as burritos, tofu hotdogs, and organic
hotdogs, as well as fresh juices and
sandwiches

Organically raised meat is a new
product to the co-op. Many members

are vegetarians, but McLeod said a
survey found a narrow majority did
want the co-op to carry meats. The
organic meat, meat from animals
who have not been treated with hor-
mones or steriods and have been
given feed that was not treated with
chemical fertilizers or insect killers,
is bought from local farms.

McLeod, who attended 4 national
expo on health food last weekend in
Philadelphia, said she and others are
amazed at how the industry has
grown from ‘‘a few hippies buying
brown rice’ to a_ million-dollar
business.

The latest trend in the industry is to
offer prepackaged fast food-type
health food. The co-op carries frozen
pies, pizzas, and taco dinners.

The food co-op buys mosts of its
grains and herbs in bulk and sells
them in smaller packages. Most
items bought at regular grocery
stores require ‘more money in
packaging than in the product,”’ says
McLeod.

Many new customers are surprised
at the higher costs of organic foods.

McLeod says she considers buying
the food as an investment in her
health. She and her family don’t
have to buy medicine or pay doctors’
bills, which makes up for the higher
cost of the food, she said.

The store carries everything to
cover family needs, includin;
natural toothpaste, dog food, sham
poo, and bug repellent. McLeod says
the only thing she buys at a regular
grocery store are toilet paper and
dish soap.

The Rockbridge Food Cooperativé
will hold a grand opening on Nov. 9
The store will be offering samples of
many of the items it carrys such as
different kinds of cheese and
crackers and soybean ice cream
McLeod encourages those who aren't
familiar with natural and organic

products to come in and look around

The co-op’s hours are from 10 a.m

to6 p.m. Monday through Friday anc
10 a.m, to 3 p.m. on Saturday. The
sandwich and juice bar, which is ex
pected to open in about a week, will
be open from 7:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m
Monday through Friday.
 

 

 

 

OPINION
Budgets

The Mock Democratic Convention is coming up this year,
and everyone is getting ready for the big event. The eyes of

 

: ,zthe country will be on W&L, so everything must go well to
---make that all important good impesssion.

The Mock Convention is valuable for W&L. Not only does it
generate interest in the university, it allows students to learn
what it takes to run an election, and makes them educated
voters when the actual election comes around. It also draws
the school together to work toward a large goal.

However, it is very unfortuante that the Executive Com-
mittee has decided that the Mock Convention is important
enough to take valuable budget money from other student
organizations. When organization’s budgets were announced,
the message was clear: everyone tighten your belts so Mock
Convention can roll through.

Here is an example of some of the resulting problems. The
'_ Ariel, The Political Review and The Journal of Science will
. all be forced to publish only one issue this year, if they rely

only on their budgets for money. All three of these publica-
tions requested $2,400 each. They each received only $1,200, a
reduction of 50 percent.

* These publications, along with other student groups that
experienced budget trims, were told to search out other
sources for funds. A great idea, if only a few groups were in-

volved. But sending out a pack of organizations to compete ©

against each other is not only unfair to the groups, but to the
alumni, parents and benefactors they will be contacting.

Although W&L benefits from generous gifts, the well of
“money is not bottomless. And with the individual states of the

.Mock Convention trying to raise money for their efforts, the
-- whole fund-raising scheme threatens to turn into a huge
fiasco.
°» Perhaps if someone on past Executive Committees had

planned ahead, this problem could have been avoided.
< Unfortunately, no one seemed to be thinking that money
could have been put aside in smaller percentages over four
years, instead of giving the Convention a huge lump sum and
killing the budgets of other organizations.
“: Also, the idea behind the budgeting is very weak in some
places. When an organization finishes the year in the black,
“the money they saved does not stay with that organization.
Instead, it goes back to a general fund to be redistributed the

“next year. This is surely one of the most ridiculous policies

‘around.

Why budget money to student organizations, then in effect
_Sive them the message to spend as much of it as they can? If
~sthe organizations were encouraged to save money and were
“allowed to keep what they saved, then that organization

would not need such a large budget. Basically, this would put
some stability into the system, which is sorely needed in
some organizations.

., The ones who get hurt the most by all this are the students.
‘They are unfairly being deprived of a full extra-curricular
“schedule, which is very important to one’s college ex-

‘perience. Although Mock Convention is important, not every

Student will want to participate. Does that mean that those

students should have activities they are interested in reduc-:
éd?

“ Everyone deserves a chance to use their talent. That is

What the organizations are for. It needs to be ensured that in

the future, everyone does have the chance to use their talents
with others who share the same interests, even if an election
year is coming up.

pose the faculty rationale-he did, by
the way, get the shirt at school--went
something like ‘“‘let’s spend this
much money to print up this many
shirts which might help these kids
resist drugs and other Nasty Peer
Pressures so they can stay out of jail

But for some reason, that shirt

very tacky green, maybe because it
conjures visions from Orwell’s

picture my skinny little brother being

_ cornered by a chain-bedecked gang

of dope fiends who wave large
reefers in his face as he slowly backs
away, mutely shaking his head and
pointing at the bold decal emblazon-

Of course, George won't be twelve
for the rest of his life, and it’s most
likely that he won’t say no to every
forbidden fruit he stumbles across.
But by the time he gets old enough to
really appreciate the temptations of
dissolute living, what will be forbid-

assured in the Bill of Rights that we
cannot be forced to testify against
ourselves: this is stated in the fifth
amendment. Thus, persons under ar-
rest must be informed of their ‘‘right
to remain silent’; citizens in court
may “plead the fifth’ in response to
an obviously self-incriminating ques-
tion or request. The fifth amendment
is a very important safeguard of in-
dividual rights-but under the Reagan
administration’s mandatory drug-
testing program, these rights are be-
ing sorely abused. i

By “mandatory drug testing,” I
refer to urine analysis, a test now be-
ing administered to government em-
ployees as well as to many em-
ployees of civilian corporations in the
United States. An interesting talk on
the ethics of such testing was given at
Washington and Lee last Thursday
by Rick Lippke, and many of the
following ideas as well as all stated
facts were originally brought forth in
his presentation:

Presumably, this test can identify
traces of cocaine or marijuana by
analysis of a urine sample. The test is
not, howover, one-hundred percent
accurate; for example, the chemical
IB Profin, found in Advil and some
other pain relievers, may _ test
positive for marijuana. Some care
may (or may not) be taken to help
enhance the accuracy of the results--
such as testing the temperature of
the sample or even supervising it’s
collection as a safeguard against
cheating the boss with borrowed
urine, or a presently available ‘‘just
add water” variety. The test is not
cheap either. A test administered
with any amount of care runs about
one hundred dollars a shot (so to
speak); in the first year of man-
datory drug testing, Reagan’s ad-
ministration spent over fifty millidh
dollars on the program. What’s
more, the government isn’t the only
organization utilizing this program;
Lippke mentioned that around thirty
percent of the corporations listed in
Fortune 500 have adopted a practice

of random drug testing. Random
testing operates in such a way that
anybody can be asked at any time to
submit a urine sample, regardless of
any cause for suspicion or lack
thereof.

This particular weapon of the so-
proclaimed ‘‘war on drugs’’ violates
the basic tenet of the fifth amend-
ment: in being asked to undergo such
testing, an individual is put into a

body to divulge information to an
that could not be dis-
covered in any other way under the
law. Thus the employee is forced to
incriminate himself if he does, in fact
use drugs, and is punished if he does

enough to ensure the guilt of the ac-
cused, making it possible to wrongly
condemn an innocent man.
Technology will, however, pro-
bably improve, possibly to the point
of 100% accuracy for these sorts of
tests. What then? If an employee
must work and live under the con-
stant threat of losing his job because
of a weekend toke, it’s most likely
that he won’t take chances. In this
way, drug testing does fulfill its aim
of preventing drug use; but it also in-
hibits that employee’s right to his
own private life, taking away his in-
dividual freedom to the point of the
unconstitutional. Why should anyone
care if Joe.the mailman gets a little
high on a Sunday afternoon? What’s
the moral difference between
high and getting drunk, legality of
substance aside? The point is, it’s
Joe’s business.
But then again, it’s not Joe's
business anymore if he gets a little
high before and during work, or if he

LETTER

The W&L Women’s Soccer Team played a
home game against Hollins College last Thurs-
day afternoon on Smith Field. Many W&L
students turned out to watch the rivalry embar-
rassingly enough, however, a very vocal group of
these W&L students cheered for Hollins. I found
this behavior revolting.

I realize that many of the people sitting in that
section of the bleachers date Hollins students—I
am certainly not criticizing that (on the con-
trary, I would encourage it). But I wonder if a
W&L coed dating a Hampden-Sydney football
player would dare to root for the Squids... It’s
just unthinkable, isn’t it? Or how about a W&L
coed cheering for the VMI tennis team? She
would be ridiculed! !

I can understand that someone would want to
support his or her friends on another team. At
the same time, what happened to respect for
one’s peers, and perhaps more importantly, for
one’s school? At the very least, these people
could have remained neutral out of mere com-
mon courtesy. It was disappointing for me as a
spectator to watch W&L students rooting against

Cheer for your own W&L teams

WLUR thanks sponsors

To the editor:

WLUR would like to publicly thank the Lex-

ington and Lee football broadcasts this year.
Through the generosity of Alvin-Dennis Clothing
and Herring Travel Services, we were able to br-

Washington and Leé football games against
Randolph-Macon and Hampden-Sydney. Without
the assistance of these public-spirited mer-
chants, our coverage of Washington and Lee
football would be limited and incomplete.

Once again, thanks to Alvin-Dennis and Her-
ring Travel for their generous support of
Washington and Lee University and WLUR.

solicit new

By Brad B. Root
Staff Reporter

 

With the 1988 Presidential Election
just around the corner, the College
Republicans will begin to solicit sup-
port for the Republican Party.

According to Greg Dale, chairman
of the College Republicans at
Washington & Lee, the purpose of the
to promote
Republican ideas on campus and get
members involved in campaigning
and establishing political platforms

This year more than 200 W&L
students expressed interest in the
College Republicans at the open
registration held during matricula-
tion. Dale noted there is a con-
siderable decrease in participation
this year compared to previous
years. Only an estimated 25 people
attended the first organizational
meeting several weeks ago. In the

members

past there have been as many as 400
members who were actively involved
in the organization.

In the next few weeks members of
the College Republicans will be
debating different issues in prepara-
tion for the Issue Conference held on
Nov. 21, at the College of Wil-
liam & Mary. Dale added, ‘We
are also going to try to do some
things with the Young Democrats
both here on campus and at other
Virginia schools.”

In February, the State Convention
will most likely be held in Roanoke.
Members of the W&L chapter may be
assiting in the organizational stages
of the program. At the convention,
delegates will be electing a chairman
for the state.

Any students still interested in join-
ing the College Republicans may at-
tend the next organizational meeting
yet tobe announced. At that meeting
a $5 dues assessment will be col-
lected.

Senior Mory Watkins will be start-
ing up a brand new organization
called the “General Volunteers’, a
volunteer social workers’ group, with
a meeting for all interested persons
tonight at 8 p.m. in the Fairfax
Lounge.

Watkins, a senior French major
from Maryland, became involved in:
social work in high school and

+ became interested in starting up a

social work group at Washington and
Lee when Marlys Craun, wife of Pro-
fessor Ed Craun of the English
Department, told him of three pro-
grams which needed volunteers.

Since then he has added two more
programs to the list and hopes that he
can get volunteers for each program.

The name of the program was
derived from the W&L mascot and
the fact that it is a diverse program.

Watkins got the go-ahead for the
organization from Dean Anne
Schroer, but has worked on it alone.
He said he has received offers from
others to help him, but he has insisted
that his project has to have some
structure before he can delegate any
responsibility.

His program is separate from
Alpha Phi Omega in that APO is a
service fraternity, and his program
's a social work program which in-
volves consistency,

What would you do if you were
President of the University for one
day? “I’d make all the faculty and
employees park in the Corral and let
the students park on the Hill,’’ said
junior Michael Forrester. “Do you
get paid? What about a free lunch?”
asked junior John Catron.

President of the University for a
day? The idea was conceived by
junior Sean Bugg and senior Jon
Solomon as a way to get students ac-
quainted with what the president
must deal with on a day-to-day basis.
President John Wilson was very en-
thusiastic about the concept. “I
thought it was a very novel idea,”’ he
said.

Various student comments follow-
ed the proposition of being president
for a day, but most students had to
give the idea much thought before
they could even provide an answer.
Junior Kelly Putney said she couldn’t

iA half-timehraffile jdtawing spon-

Weekend football game Oct. 31 will
determine who gets use of President
Wilson’s office on the following Mon-
day, Nov. 2. Tickets can be bought
for $2 each in the co-op starting
tomorrow until the following Friday.
All proceeds from the raffle will be
donated to the United Way.

While some lucky student is sitting
in President Wilson’s office, atten-
ding meetings and speaking with his
staff about current problems that
have arisen, President Wilson will be
sitting in that student’s classes tak-
ing notes. President Wilson said
“every 5 minutes something new
comes up,”’ so whoever is president
for the day will have to deal with
that. However, he added that the stu-
dent would not be able to change
University policies for the day.

What if the student encounters

what I see as the definition of social
work—consistent work with people.”’

The list of programs that will be
started consist of an Alternative
Education program, The Eagles Nest
Clubhouse Program, the Lincoln
House program, The Mayflower Nur-
sing Home Program, and an Out-
Patient Escort Service program.

The Alternative Education pro-
gram, located in the National Guard
Armory in town, is composed of
several students who have been
removed from high school and need
one-to-one tutors for their basic sub-
jects.

The Eagles Nest Clubhouse Pro-
gram, in downtown Buena Vista,
operates as a bridge for mentally ill
patients who are getting back into

society. The Lincoln House, located
between Lexington and Buena Vista,
is a program which involves interac-
tion with the mentally retarded.

The Mayflower Nursing Home Pro-
gram, operated through Stonewall
Jackson Hospital, consists of visiting
the elderly.

The Out-Patient Escort Service
program at the hospital helps out-
patients with their recoveries.

Volunteers will be able to choose
whatever program they wish to work
with. They will, however, be asked to
sign a contract because of the time
commitment.

“Social work involves a commit-
ment to have any long-term effects,”
said Watkins.

dent's attention? ‘‘I would have to be

Wilson said.

“Well, if [have Mr. Futch’s class I'll

added, “I hope the faculty won't

“If | were President, I would make
it required to go to the football games
and stay for the whole thing,” said
Catron. President Wilson com-
mented, ‘*Obviously, he
overestimates the power of the presi-
gent!

He also said that other volunteers
who cannot make the time commit-
ment will be welcomed.

He hopes to get some funding for
the organization, but included that
because it is still in its building
stages, there is some uncertainty as
to its needs.

He will fill whatever programs he
can, but said that one program get-
ting many more volunteers could
cause a problem because one group
would become stronger than the
others, and he wants to keep the
“General Volunteers” unified.

He estimated that in 3-4 weeks all
of the programs will be off the
ground.

“As soon as the links are establish-
ed, the programs will start.”’

He said he wants others to ex-
perience what a great thing social
work has been for him from every
angle, not to mention that it will pro-
vide future references.

“I’m so excited, it’s like starting a
revolution or something,’’ he said.

He wants the organization to carry
on year after year and continue to
grow so that it will include programs
other than the five he is beginning
with.

Job fair held for seniors

By Sean Campbell
Staff Reporter

 

CHALLENGE ’88, a career fair for
seniors sponsored by nine of the area
colleges and universities, currently
has 48 organizations scheduled to
provide information and conduct in-
terviews at the Radisson Hotel in
Lynchburg on Wednesday,
November 18th.

The majority of the organizations
are Virginia-based. However several
federal organizations such as the FBI
and the CIA are scheduled partici-
pants.

Washington and Lee University’s
Career Development and Placement
office promotes the program saying
it will provide students with an op-
portunity to talk with employers
representing a wide range of career
areas.

Employers from the banking,
finance, marketing, sales, retailing,
graphics and writing fields plan to
have tables of information about
their organization in a central area.

In addition, students submitting a
resume, with their registration may

have an opportunity to interview with
companies. A pre-selection proccess
will determine who is offered an in-
terview. The promotional flyer says
some companies also will holc
general information sessions from
6:30 to 9:30 p.m.

The participation in the fair is
limited to students from the nine
schools sponsoring the event
Hampden-Sydney College, Hollin:
College, Longwood College, Lyn
chburg College, Mary Baldwin Col
lege, Randolph-Macon Woman’s Co!
lege, Sweet Briar College, VMI, an
W&L.

Registration fees are $\ per stu
dent. Also, two copies of each par
ticipant’s resume are required fo
registration. These will be placed ii
resume books for employer refer
ence. Additional resumes for ever’
company a student would like to in
terview with must be turned in by Oc
tober 16, the registration deadline.

Students granted interviews wi
sign up either by 8:30 a.m. for th
morning session or 1:30 p.m. for th
afternoon session on November 18.

Commerce School purchases new microcomputers to aid students

 

From Staff Reports

 

If Congress cuts next year’s budget
by $60 billion, what will be the effect
on the national economy?

Nobody really knows the answer to
that question, but it’s a typical
forecasting problem that professors
might ask their students in a college
economics class.

Hours of research in the library
would enable the college student to
make some predictions, and, when
the next class meets, those predic-
tions could be discussed. But, at the
Commerce School students can work
on that problem as soon as it’s asked,
for all the students in the class are
sitting at their own IBM Personal
System/2 Model 50 computer.

In recent years, computers have
become an integral part of most
departments at W&L. But what
makes this lab unusual is that the 29
new microcomputers in the lab will
soon be hooked up into a common net-
work with all the other computers in
the building.

That network will be controlled by
file servers located in the adjoining
laboratory manager’s office.

This network will allow instructors
to work in their own offices, store in-

formation on the file servers, and
have students gain access to the data
in the microcomputer lab, thus utiliz-
ing the lab for individualized class in-
struction, we well as for classroom
assignments.

Programs that are already on the
computers are Word Perfect, Lotus,
and the Dow Jones Information
Retrieval system which connects to
an off-campus base. In addition,
some of the computers have access to
statistical programs on the universi-
ty’s prime computer.

Most students are already familiar
with the Word Perfect word process-
ing program. Lotus is a spreadsheet
program for accounting, and the Dow
Jones News Retrieval provides ac-
cess to a complete financial profile of
businesses.

An instructor’s work station at the
front of the room will enable pro-
fessors to control the 29 monitors in
the lab to transmit the contents of
their screens to those of his students.
The lab, also equipped with seven
printers, is accessible 24 hours a day
and is staffed until 11:30 p.m.

In a memo to W&L President John
D. Wilson last year, Larry C. Pep-
pers, dean of the School of Com
merce, Economics, and Politics
stated, “We face a major challenge

in fully integrating microcomputers
into the curriculum of the (Com
merce) School.”’

“This computer lab will allow
faculty members time to focus on the
challenging task of curriculum revi
sion as courses are overhauled to in-
corporate microcomputer
techology,’’ said Peppers.

An ad hoc microcomputer planning
committee comprised of Commerce
School faculty members submitted a
report outlining the hardware needed
for such a facility. The cost estimate
was $200,000. Contributions from
W&L alumni honoring senior pro-

fessors paid for the project
Earl Edwards, a 1969 W&L
graduate, is the lab’s full-time

manager. Among his many duties is
instructing students in microcom
puter mechanics (how to create files,
save data, etc).

A Lexington native, Edwards has
worked with computers since he
graduated from W&L. Most recently
he traveled across the country in-

stalling software for steel fabricators
for Structural Software Co. of
Roanoke

Of the new IBM Personal System /9
Model 50
“This is a new. generation of
machine. The operating system for

networking won’t even be ready until
next spring. That gives us almost a
year to get the faculty and students
used to the machines.”’

The new machines are faster, more
compact, and use 3 1/2 inch high den-
sity microdiskets, which hold four

times more information than floppy
disks. Each machine has a hard disk
that can store all the basic programs.
When the system is networked next
spring, common data bases can be in-
stalled and made available to
everyone in the building.

“The laboratory speaks to
critical need in the School of Cor
merce, Economics, and Politics
states Dean Peppers. With the ce
tral accessibility of so much inform
tion, there’s no doubt that it ‘mak
everyone much more productive.”’

LSAT is called ‘five hours of living hell’

 

By James Midkiff
Staff Reporter

 

“Five hours of living hell.’’ That is
how senior Tom O’Brien described
the Law School Admission Test.
Another senior, Bucky Strauch, was
a little more reserved. ‘‘It was not an
enjoyable experience.’

Greg Unger said, “When I walked
out of the test, my brain was intellec-
tual Jell-O.”

Every year, law school hopefuls
across the country subject
themselves to the intellectual trials
of the standardized test put out by the
Law School Admissions Service.
Last Saturday, 85 students took the
test when it was offered at W&L. Ac-
cording to Dr. Rick Heatley, director
of Career Services and Development,
that is almost twice as many as last
year.

Heatley said more people are tak-
‘ing the test across the nation; so
many that the company that provides
the test has been caught shorthand-
ed. Naturally, the number of people
taking the test has risen by 40 per-
cent.

Heatley thought that the sudden in-
crease of interest may be tied to the
depictions of lawyers in the popular
“L.A. Law’ television series or
because of interest in the Iran-Conra
investigations. The result of this
surge in interest may be that law
school admissions will be more com-
petitive this year, according to
Heatley.

Many law schools are already very
selective. The mean GPA for
students entering W&L Law School
last year was 3.2. These student’s
mean score on the 10- to 48- point
scale of the LSAT was 35.

Law professor Edward Henneman

said that an applicant’s GPA and
LSAT score are two of the most im-
portant factors considered by law
schools.

The LSAT does not test how much
an applicant knows, though. Instead,
the LSAT is designed to test how a
person thinks. According to Hen-
neman, the LSAT is supposed to be a
good predictor of first year perfor-
mance, but a high score does not
mean that a student will do well in
law school.

A low score could keep a student
out of law school altogether, though.

It is because the LSAT is so very
important to pre-law students that
several courses have sprung up
claiming to help prepare students for
the test. One such course was offered
at W&L.

Greg Unger, a senior that took the
LSAT Prep Course, expressed the
common belief that the course was
not worth the $295 cost.

Blood Drive falls short of goal; nets

 

By lan Thompson
Staff Reporter

 

The Blood Drive held in Doremus
Gym on October 7th failed to meet
their goal of 150 pints of blood,
although the American Red Cross did
accept 129 pints from donors of the
W&L Community.

Norma Hancock, a_ registered
nurse, described the W&L Blood
Drive as “‘successful’’ compared to
other small college campus blood
drives. The Red Cross has taken
other blood mobiles to Roanoke Col-
lege, Hampden-Sydney and Hollins
College among others.

The first donor came through the
door at 11:30 a.m., although most
donors came in the late afternoon
before 5:00. Hancock described this
period as “‘hectic since it takes 45
minutes per donor.”’

Each donor went through seven
stations. First the donor registered,
then moved to the medical history
and temperature check station.
Some questions included in the
medical history are ‘‘ever taken self-
injected drugs?’’ and ‘‘been to Haiti
or Zaire?”

Next a Women’s Auxiliary
volunteer questions the donor about
“tatoos, hepatitis and AIDS among
other things,” said Hancock.

The fourth station

is the

hemoglobin station where the donor
has his ear pricked to determine his
or her iron content in their blood.
The donor them picks up an empty
blood bottie and is escorted to a cot
where a nurse asks the donor more
questions. Hancock said “‘the nurses
repeat some of the important ques-
tions concerning AIDS”’

When asked whether ail the nurses
were registered, Hancock said that
some nurses were “‘licensed practi-
cianers who are qualified to let
blood”, although they were ‘‘not
R.N.’s”.

Blood-letting takes about five
minutes and is followed by a 15-
minute recovery, during which

“T could have learned the same
thing from buying the book and mak-
ing the effort myself,” Unger said.

Tom O’Brien took the Kaplan
course during the summer and
thought that it helped him on the test.

“‘T knew what type of test it would
be,”’ O’Brien said. ‘The course
taught you how to pace yourself.”’

“Tf it helps me get in law school, it
was worth it,”’ he said.

The Kaplan course cost nearly
$500.

Professor Henneman did not know
if such courses could actually help a
student raise his score. He did not
think that it could hurt, and it might
lend confidence.

The LSAT will be offered again on
Dec. 12. The deadline to register is
Nov. 12, but those wishing to take the
test should sign up as soon as possi-
ble, according to Dr. Heatley.

129 pints

donors were provided sandwiches
and sodas by the Newcomer’s Club.

What was the reaction to giving
blood? John Missert, senior and six-
time blood donation veteran said ‘‘it
didn’t hurt at all’. Missert donated
the much in demand blood type, O
positive.

Some donors pass out. ‘‘This is
rare,’ said Hancock, ‘“‘and these
donors are told not to give blood.”’

Student organizer, Chris Martin
said ‘It went pretty well considering
everyone was sick.’’ The IFC award-
ed prize money to the fraternities

Delta Theta won $100, Pi Kappa

An ‘unusual’ toy shop ignores electronics

 

Robert MacPherson
Staff Reporter

 

All over the United States, children
are amusing themselves with elec-
tronic gadgets that beep, blink and
the touch of a button, and it is safe to
assume that manufacturers and

store owners alike are following the
trend.

That is, store owners other than
Nancy Jarrell.

Despite the popularity of electronic
toys, Jarrell specializes in what she

calls “‘the different and the unusual”
in her store, Creative Dimensions.
Located at 117 W. Nelson St. in Lex-
ington, Creative Dimensions has
something for kids of all ages.

‘‘No one ever grows up,”’ said Jar-
rell, referring to the reason why her
store has survived for almost three
years. “I have as many older
customers as I do younger ones,”’ she
said,

Jarrell said that she is able to com-
pete with larger stores such as Roses
and Maxway because she carries
items that those stores do not.

“People still want old-fashioned
toys. I carry fun things that even
adults like,” Jarrell said.

Until last April, Creative Dimen-
sions was located in Lexington’s
Main Street Mall. Jarrell said that
the store on Nelson Street is about 300
square feet larger than the one on
Main Street. She said that the move
to the larger store has increased
business “‘a great deal.”

Items for sale at Creative Dimen-
sions include candles, greeting
cards, stuffed animals and games as
well as toys. According to Jarrell,

most student business comes from
sales of stuffed animals.

Jarrell said that she expects this
year’s holiday season to be a big one
for her store despite new toys which
she says are “‘nothing spectacular.”
She said that a current big-seller is a
stuffed version of the Anheiser-Busch

mascot Spuds MacKenzie.
Jarrell said that Creative Dimen-
sions offers a layaway plan qnd ac-

cepts majorcreditcards. ©

Store hours are 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
Monday through Friday. Jarrell said
that hours will be extended during
the holiday season.

points, money substitutes which are
available to students and faculty at a
discount rate, were up to almost
$4,000.

Torrence said the rise in the drink-
ing age and stricter security on band
nights were two of the main reasons
for the decline in beer sales.

‘We all work for the university so
we can’t encourage students to
drink,”’ he said.

He added that because the GHQ is
affiliated with the university, it can-
not advertise off-campus.

“Since we are a non-profit opera-

tion, we can under-sell the area
restaurants,” Torrence explained.

According to Torrence, the main
objective of the GHQ is to “‘offer an
alternative to the snack bar and the
dining hall.”

“The GHQ is the only place on
campus where you can go to sit down
and be waited on,” he said.

Torrence said that in addition to
the traditional Wednesday night
bands, the GHQ will be sponsoring
bands on Friday nights. He said that
when the GHQ sponsors a band, the
only money it brings in is from beer
sales.

“The band plays for the door,
that’s the deal,”’ he said.

Torrence said that the odds are
about ‘‘50-50” that a Friday night
band will be good business.

The GHQ is open for lunch from
11:30 a.m. until 2:00 p.m. Monday
through Friday. Dinner hours are
from 5 p.m. until 7:30 p.m. Sunday

How sweet it is.

The Washington and Lee women’s
cross country team won its first meet
of the season Saturday, defeating
Emory and Henry, 45-18, in Lex-
ington.

The Generals (1-2) had help from
two sources in gaining the victory:
the arrival of a new runner and the
advantage of running on their

 

challenging home course.

Freshman Paige Cason took se-
cond place overall for W&L, finishing
in a time of 24:01 over the 5-kilometer
course. Her time was good enough to
break the course record for W&L run-
ners and was the third time this
season that she was the General’s top
finisher. However, it was the perfor-
mance of the team’s second finisher,
freshman Shawn Wert, that gave
W&L an extra lift.

“I knew that Shawn would do well
when she got a chance to run with
us,”’ said head coach Jim Phemister,
“because she’s run with us some in

practice and she’s a very tough run-
ner. I was very pleased, but not sur-
prised.”’

Wert, running in her first meet
because of a commitment to fall ten-
nis, finished fifth overall with a time
of 26:29. Wert was the General’s No.
5 singles player on the women’s ten-
nis team before joining the cross
country team.

Juniors Stephanie Smith and Anne
Geary and freshman Margaret Boyd
were the other three scorers for
W&L.

Running on one’s home course can
give a decisive edge and, according

to Phemister, this was definitely the
case in this meet.

“Our course is a very hard one for
everybody,’”’ he said. “It’s also a
very slow one for everyone.
Everyone who ran on it ran probably
several minutes slower than they run
on other courses. The harder it is,
the more home court advantage that
gives you.”

Phemister also cited the impor-
tance of experience when racing on a
difficult course.

“Our two junior runners, Anne
Geary and Stephaie Smith, who are
both experienced on the course,

Women harriers win 1st meet of season on home course

seemed to respond well to it,’’ he
said.

The Generals will compete again in
Lexington on Saturday at 2 p.m. in
what Phemister calls a ‘jumbled’
meet. Runners from Southern
Seminary, Hollins, Sweet Briar,
Mary Baldwin and West Virginia
Tech willl possibly race, but
Phemister said he was not certain
whether any of the schools would
field a full team. The men’s cross
country team, which did not compete
last week, will go up against
Bridgewater and West Virginia Tech
at 2:30 p.m.

“Revenge

sweet
for polo

 

By Hunter Catlett
* Staff Reporter

Revenge is sweet. For the second
straight week, the 18th-ranked
, Washington and Lee water polo team
avenged one of its few losses this
season.

In the final game of the Southern
“League tournament’s second round,
»W&L defeated the University of

Arkansas-Little Rock 12-9 Sunday in
Richmond.

. In the first round of the Southern
League tournament, held here in
‘Lexington, Arkansas defeated the
,Generals 13-11 in a controversial
finish

 

* The tournaments first game pitted
_W&L against Hampden-Sydney. Led
by junior Stuart Sheldon’s four goals,
>the Generals easily disposed of the
Tigers for the second time this
season, 15-3.

The second game of the tourna-

ment had W&L and the University of

‘ North Carolina-Wilmington squaring

off. The Generals jumped to a 5-1
halftime lead and, led by junior
*David Reavey’s four goals and junior
. David Dietz’s three goals, cruised to
a 13-4 victory.

In the semi-finals the Generals met
*George Washington University. The
first half was a defensive war that
saw the Generals claw their way toa
4-2 halftime lead.

“We started off slow.-The coach
‘said we needed-a big win, so we just
tightened the screws and became
more intense,’ said junior Martin
‘Burlingame, who led the Generals
-with four goals in the game.

Indeed they did. The offense open-
“ed up and the defense pitched a sec-
-ond half shutout as the Generals went
-on to win 12-2.

sive first quarter, the Generals led

Less than a minute later, Arkansas
scored on a penalty shot to tie the
game.

_ Reavy struck again with 2:28 left in
the period to give W&L a 7-6 lead, on-
ly to see the Trojans charge back and
tie the game again with 1:03 left.
Junior Moose Herring connected ona
shot just 15 seconds later to give the
Generals an 8-7 lead after three
periods of play.

* Arkansas was unable to recover as

posting a 12-9 win.

* The water polo team will get a well-

deserved break this week in their
schedule.

Women win 1st

 

From Staff Reports

After winning its very first game —
ever — Saturday against Sweet
Briar, the women’s soccer team
returned to Lexington to tie Lynch-
burg on Wednesday.

The Generals downed Sweet Briar
3-2 in overtime. Sophomore Satah
Allen booted in the game-winner
from 20 yards out with 3:40 left in the
first of two overtime periods.

The women led at the end of the
first half 1-0 ona goal by junior Alexa

Men-get
2 victories

By Gary McCullough
Staff Reporter

 

 

The men’s soccer team fought two
very close battles this week and
came out on top in both. The wins
were not against Old Dominion
Athletic Conference foes, but the
Generals’ overall record buoyed
back up to sea level at 5-5.

The Generals made their first
strike of the week on Saturday at
Gettysburg. Senior captain John Coll
had two direct hits in the first half of
the game. W&L was denied any score
padding in the second half, but the
two-goal margin proved to be too
large for Gettysburg, which was only
able to score one goal in the second
half.

The VMI Keydets stormed Wilson
Field on Tuesday for the annual
cross-town rivalry between W&L and
VMI.

Charles Lyle was the General who
took advantage of a short-range shot
that put W&L on top, but that was
about all the action for the
scorekeeper as the Generals held on
for a 1-0 win on a dreary Lexington
fall afternoon.

“Their style is real physical and
aggressive,’’ said sophomore Rick
Silva.

Salzman and sophomore Mary Alice
McMorrow doubled the score.

On Wednesday, sophomore Joelle
Jackson kicked in a goal with six
minutes remaining in the second
overtime period to tie the Generals
with Lynchburg at 1-1. Ties stand
during the regular season.

W&L’s record is now 1-7-2, The
Generals will face Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College on Saturday at
11:30 a.m. on the New Alumni Field.

Football loses 3rd

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

Teams that are highly touted in
pre-season polls often disappoint
their admirers once the real competi-
tion begins. But, as Washington and
Lee head football coach Gary Fallon
will quickly tell you, such is not the
case with the Hampden-Sydney
Tigers.

Living up to their reputation as
pre-season favorites to win the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference cham-
pionship, the Tigers steamrolled the
Washington and Lee Generals on
Saturday, 35-7.

“They certainly didn’t disap-
point,’”’ said Fallon. “I think it was
their quickness that gave them the
added edge.”’

The opening drive was surprisingly
balanced. Hampden-Sydney threw
three times and gave the ball to the
tailback four times; in fact, head
coach Joe Bush all but ignored his
leading rusher, senior fullback David
Kelly. But the Tigers showed they
didn’t need the potential All-
American. Hampden-Sydney took
the lead it would never relinquish
less then six minutes into the game
on a 6-yard run by senior tailback
Kevin Wallace. Sophomore kicker
Jimmy Hondroulis extended his
perfect career in extra points to give
the Tigers a 7-0 advantage.

The W&L offense took the field for
only three plays, losing three yards
before junior Tom Skeen was called

 

on to punt. Two plays later, the W&L
offense took Kelly out of the
ballgame with a knee injury. When
Hampden-Sydney’s John Jewell
fumbled away the football on the
very next play, things were suddenly
looking up for W&L. But the Generals
managed only five yards in three
plays before Skeen returned to the
game once again.

This time, however, the Tiger of-
fense stalled at the Hampden-Sydney
21, and the Generals took over at
their own 32. But sophomore quarter-
back Phil Sampson threw an in-
terception on first down, and the
Tigers were soon back in the end
zone.

The subsequent W&L possession
was the closest thing to a drive the
Generals could manage in the first
half. Starting at his own 23, Sampson
completed four passes and carried
the ball twice before being sacked at
the Hampden-Sydney 42. A Sampson
pass was picked off by Tiger
freshman David Ingram on the very
next play, and the W&L offense left
the field empty-handed yet again.

The Generals received the kickoff
to open the second half, but picked up
right where they left off. After a first
down pass to senior tight end Gar
Prebor, Sampson was intercepted by
Tiger freshman Trip McLaughlin.

Turned away again, it was time for
the W&L defense to provide some
momentum. The Tigers drove to the
W&L 3, where the defense held on
fourth down. A clear swing in
momentum followed, and the
Generals drove 97 yards in only 11
plays, including five consecutive
completions by Sampson. The Gen-
erals scored on_ second-and-goal
when Sampson hit senior split end
John Roe in the end zone. Quayle’s
extra point made the score 21-7 with
12:51 left in the fourth quarter, and a
game that seemed all but over
moments earlier was suddenly that
much closer.

The victory was the third win in a
row for the Tigers, who are
undefeated in three ODAC games.
The Generals fell to 2-3 overall and
1-3 in the conference.

 

 

A hit!

Yankees’ owner
a real disgrace

The recent firing of Lou Pinella from the position of New York
Yankees manager is the last straw. George Steinbrenner is not only a
disgrace to the -game of baseball, he is also a big, fat, ugly jerk of a
human being.

Can Steinbrenner show any patience? How about compassion?
Maybe some understanding? Nah, all ol’ George is concerned about is
winning pennants and making bucks, which is ironic considering that
it is lack of concern for his players that is keeping him from claiming
the American League East title.

Come on, George! Relax. Take a chill pill, for Pete’s sake. You
have great players, used to have a great manager and Yankee
Stadium is one of the best fields around. So what’s the problem? I’ll
tell you. Steinbrenner has no brain!

Why fire Pinella when he is respected and admired by both his team-
mates and managers around the league? And his replacement? Billy
Martin? What’s this make it: the 100th time he’s managed the
ballclub? Gimme a break. It seems to me that George is bored with
trying to win championships (which would happen if he would just
keep his fat nose out of the dugout) and just wants to instigate
something in the newspapers. You know the old story. Everyone has
forgotten about the poor Yankees so George decides the best way to
make people notice again is to make a radical move or lambast some
player through the press.

Let’s take an example of the insaneness of it all. Don Mattingly,
New York’s gold-glove first baseman and a person most fans consider
God in spikes and batting gloves, is the player involved. Steinbrenner
wants the team to practice on Mondays, one of the few off days for
ballplayers. It’s a volunteer workout. George, however, has express-
ed his desire for everyone to attend. Mattingly is a no-show. No pro-
blem, right? You know, every superstar needs a day off every now
and then. But nooooooo00! George says Mattingly is a slacker, a guy
who is not willing to lay it on the line for his team. Who is he kidding?
To add insult to injury, the gutless Steinbrenner does it in the papers.
Why don’t you say it to his face, wimp?

Steinbrenner justifies all his actions by saying he is acting just like
any normal fan who wants his money’s worth. He reasons that he is
paying Dave Winfield $2 million a year for home runs and RBI and he
doesn’t get them on a consistent basis, someone is going to face the
consequences.

What Steinbrenner doesn’t realize is that he doesn’t own a team of
baseball machines. They are human beings. No one (especially you)
is perfect, George. Why don’t you get off théir backs? You haven't
won anything doing it your way, now have you? Why don’t you just
leave your players and manager alone? Take a trip to Russia in April
and don’t come back until October. I think it’s a pretty good idea.

As long as Steinbrenner is owner, I hope the Yankees don’t win
another game. Wouldn't you just love to see a 0-162 record for the 1988
season? I know I would. I wish no happiness for you Steinbrenner, you
rich, spoiled bum. You stink.

 

 

NOTES — Ah, the strike, she is over. Nice move on the players part.
They throw almost a quarter of their season’s salary in the garabage
and end up taking an action that they could have done in August,
before any of this happened. Final Score: Owners 72, Players 0 ...
Congratulations to the women’s soccer team for its first win of the
season and the program on Saturday ... The Twins will win the World
Series in six games. Bet the ranch and the dog on this one... Will the
NHL’s regular season ever mean anything? Will anything meaningful
be said by ALF, the dog from outerspace? I think not...

TheNam Triad is completed

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

On May 10, 1969, the 10ist Airborne
Division's B Company, and the 3rd
Battalion of the 187th Infantry storm-
ed up Ap Bia Mountain in the heart of
Vietnam’s A Shau Valley. Ten days
and 241 American fatalities later, the
North Vietnamese Army was gone
and Ap Bia Mountain was secured.
The American government called Ap
Bia a victory. The soldiers who
fought there called it ‘“‘Hamburger
Hill.”” In Vietnam, there were no vic-
tories, only victims.

Less than a year ago, Oliver
Stone’s Platoon examined the
morality of Vietnam, and for the first
time, presented on screen, the harsh
realities of the war that the
American public had chosen to ig-
nore or forget. Then in May, Stanley
Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket showed
us the psychological side of Vietnam,
the warping effects of which
thousands of American veterans are
forced to live every day. Now, John
Irvin's Hamburger Hill completes
the triad by bringing to the screen,
the blinding, maiming, killing side of
Vietnam; the violent side.

Platoon chronicles the develop-
ment of Chris (Charlie Sheen), a col-
lege dropout who volunteers for Viet-
nam to see the “glory of war.’ What
he finds instead, is a war of ethicsbet-
ween the sadistic sergeant Barnes
(Tom Berenger) and the humane
sergeant Elias (Willem DaFoe) that
ultimately leads to destruction and
death. Chris’ final soliloquy, given as
he is being pulled out of the war to
finally go home, sums up the haun-
ting message that Stone implies in
the film.

“TI think now, looking back, we did
not fight the enemy. We fought
ourselves. And the enemy was in us.
The war is over for me now; but it
will always be there, the rest of my
days. As I’m sure Elias will be;
fighting with Barnes for what Rhah
called: possession of my soul. There
are times since, I’ve felt like a child,
born of those two fathers. But be that
as it may, those of us who did make
it, have an obligation to build again.
To teach to others what we know, and
to try with what’s left of our lives, to
find a goodness and a meaning to this
life.”’

Vietnam was a chess match played
by an_ indecisive, uncommitted
American government that used the
youth of our country as pawns.
Thousands of American soldiers
were lost unnecessarilly, and for
what? For truth, justice, and the
American way? Fifty-eight thousand
of our veterans died in the Vietnam
War, yet today, communism is still a
way of life for the Vietnamese.

Haunting memories are a way of
life for many of the American
veterans who fought in Vietnam.
Thoughts and visions of the war are a
hell that only they can understand,
and one that follows them like the
death that shadowed them in the
southeast Asian jungles. These
psychological effects are the subject
of Stanley Kubrick’s Full Metal
Jacket.

If there is one word to describe
Kubrick’s films, the word is shock-
ing. Full Metal Jacket is no excep-
tion. Kubrick’s film, based on the
novel, The Short-Timers, is a
scrutinized study of the psycho-
logical side of the Vietnam War. The
first half of the film is spent in basic
training where the recruits are brain-
washed into becoming killing
machines.

“This is my rifle.

There are many like it, but this one
is mine.

My rifle is my best friend. It is my
life.

I must master it as I must master
my life.

Without me, my rifle is useless.”’

Following week after week of this
routine, and total physical, emo-
tional, and psychological humiliation
and degradation, the soldiers com-
plete their basic training and go
directly into Vietnam to prove
themselves. It is there in combat,
when the platoon is picked apart and
murdered by a mere child, that the
soldiers, most especially Joker (Mat-
thew Modine), begin to realize and
understand the futility of the
American occupation in Vietnam.

Joker’s realization is, on a personal
scale, what John Irvin examines on a
large scale in Hamburger Hill.
Though it is never mentioned in the
film the saddest aspect about the at-
tack and subsequent takeover of Ap
Bia Mountain was that within a
month of the seizure, the mountain
was abandoned by American forces

 

While the rest of the world wondered why. the Sereannt back

and retaken by the Vietnamese. "The
entire offensive on ‘Hamburger
Hill’ existed to repel the North Viet-
namese Army away from coastal
regions. There was never any inten-
tion to keep what we had taken, and
as a result, 241 American soldiers
died in vain.

John Irvin’s Hamburger Hill is a
powerful film that pulsates with
overwhelming violence. Irvin does
however take time to make a
political statement. The film has ex-
tremely heavy undertones of the
apathetic American attitudes that
many Vietnam protesters shared.

In one of the scenes, a reporter con-
fronts the commanding officer of the
platoon that just stormed the
hill, and says to him, ‘‘Word at
headquarters is that you can’t take
the hill. Senator Kennedy says you
don’t have a chance. What do you
think of that?” Sadly, this attitude is
the same lethargic, apathic attitude
that soldiers came home to after the
war. Men deserving a_ hero's
welcome received nothing but
animosity and contempt.

At one point in the film during a

discussion among the soldiers about |

their backgrounds, the doctor of the
platoon replies, ‘‘We are all no good
niggers on this hill, blood and soul.’’
Vietnam took every kind of man, and
denied for many, their life, their
health, and their happiness. The War

Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, and
Hamburger Hill are all excellent
films. Though they each give totally
different perspectives on the War,
together they form a triad that when
united, takes a giant step toward
understanding the hows, whats, and
whys of Vietnam. Oliver Stone,
Stanley Kubrick, and John Irvin have
stepped back and asked why. Their
answer is; that there is no answer.
The three films manifest themselves
in acts of violence, just like the war
itself.

Platoon ends with a shot of the war-
torn jungle that Charlie is being
taken out of. Full Metal Jacket ends
with an expanding shot of a bomb
crater where bodies covered in lime
are being bulldozed in for a mass
burial. Hamburger Hill ends with a
shot of the mountain, and the hun-
dreds of dead bodies that cover it.
Each film ends with a tragic state-
ment. Was it all really necessary?

Perhaps the best expression of the
intentions, and aspirations of the
directors in making these three
films, comes from a poem that closes
Hamburger Hill.

“If you are able, save for them a
place inside of you, and save one
backward glance when you are leav-
ing for the places they can no longer

go

them, though you may, or may not
have always. Take what they have
left, and what they have taught you
with their dying, and keep it with
your own. And in that time when men
decide and feel safe to call the war in-
sane, take one moment to embrace
those gentle heroes you left behind.”
