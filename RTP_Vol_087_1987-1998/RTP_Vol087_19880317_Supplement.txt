Accuracy is part of convention's history

 

By Jennifer Bandrowski
Staff Reporter

 

1988 is the year of W&L’s
19th Mock Convention, main-
taining .an eighty-year-old tra-
dition. The convention began in
1908 as a class project for a poli-
tics course taught by Assistant
Professor of Economics and
Politics W. Jett Lauck.

Students had been inspired a
few weeks before by William
Jennings Bryan's ‘‘Cross of
Gold’’ speech, ziven in Lexing-
ton. He was consequently cho-
sen as the Democratic nominee
by the first Mock Convention,
beginning the con/ention’s 80
year tradition of accuracy.

This first Mock Convention
was given nominal, second-page
coverage by The Ring-Tum Phi.
However, the The Lexington
Gazette ran an impressive front-
page story, praising those in-
volved.

*‘The young gentlemen en-
tered into the meeting with the
zest of seasoned politicians, plus
the enthusiasm of collegians.”’

Debates had become so heated
at the first convention between
supporters of Minnesota Gov-
ernor John A. Johnson and those
of Bryan that fist fights were
threatened and the members of
the Kansas delegation almost
withdrew from the activity.

In 1912, the convention expe-
rienced its first error. It nomi-
nated Judson Harmon rather
than Woodrow Wilson, who was
expected to be a dark horse.

In 1916, when Wilson ap-
peared to be the obvious Demo-
cratic nominee, W&L students
chose to hold a Mock Republi-
can Convention, thus beginning
the tradition of predicting the
outcome of the convention for
the party out of power in the
White House.

With the majority of W&L
students at this time being De-
mocrats, those involved with the
1916 Convention learned of the
need for intense research, which
was rewarded with the correct
prediction of Charles Evans
Hughes.

The 1916 convention began in
the new Doremus gymnasium
and then moved to Lee Chapel,
where the first two had been
held. From then on, all conven-
tions were held in Doremus.

Due to a low enrollment and
lack of interest following World
War I, no convention was held.
This was made up for, however,
with the exciting wet/dry debates
of the 1924 Convention.

Candidates were divided re-
gionally and by issues, leaving
delegates puzzled over a com-
promise candidate. They finally
decided on W&L alumnus John
W. Davis. Davis was a West
Virginia congressman, Solicitor-
General, and ambassador to
Great Britain.

That summer in New York
City, the real convention was
also marked by heated debate
over the 18th amendment and
sectionalist disagreement over
candidates. Following the pat-
tern of the W&L students, they

too selected Davis. The conven-
tion closed to the tune of the
““W&L Swing,’’ which became
Davis’ campaign song.

The Convention suffered some
hard times from 1936 through
1948, with three wrong predic-
tions and the absence of a con-
vention in 1944, due to the
aftermath of World War II.

Since then, however, it has
maintained its tradition of accur-
acy. The only incorrect predic-
tion made since World War II
was in 1972 when Edward M.
Kennedy was chosen rather than
George McGovern.

In 1952, Mock Convention
leaders learned the value of
maintaining contact with state
party leaders, a precedent estab-
lished by economics major Da-
vid Constine, who was state
chairman of California.

California Governor Earl
Warren, a dark horse candidate
who would head the California
delegation at the actual conven-
tion, was trailing Sen. Robert A.
Taft of Ohio and World War II
hero General Dwight D. Eisen-
hower after three ballots. War-
ren contacted Constine and told
him to free his delegates, who
swung to Eisenhower, giving
him the nomination and making
Warren his running mate.

The same convention was also
highlighted by prominent guest
speakers Harold Bratches, the
Chairman of the Republican
National Committee, and Sena-
tor Frank Carlson, Director of
the National Eisenhower Head-
quarters.

The Mock Convention
received national attention in the
face of tragedy in 1956. Senator
Alben Barkley of Kentucky, who

cod

W&L students shown with a Democratic Party representative.

had been Vice President under
Truman, was the keynote
speaker. Barkley mentioned dur-
ing his speech the Mock Conven-
tion had inspired him to plan on
attending the national conven-
tion that summer, though he had
not planned to previously. He
felt ‘‘like an old firehorse that
hears the bell.’’ Becoming more
and more emotional as he spoke,
Barkley exclaimed, ‘‘I would
rather be a servant in the house
of the Lord than to sit in the seats
of the mighty.”’ These would be
the Senator’s last words for he
collapsed suddenly of a heart at-
tack and fifteen minutes later
was pronounced dead.

With the encouragement of
Barkley’s widow, convention ac-
tivity was resumed a week later
to accurately nominate Adlai
Stevenson. At the next conven-
tion, Harry Truman himself
would be the keynote speaker.

Since then, the Convention
has continued its accuracy as
well as attracted much attention
to Lexington every four years.

Recent conventions have fea-
tured such large political figures
as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Car-
ter, and Barry Goldwater, and
the 1988 convention has already
been kicked off, of course, with
the speech of Jesse Jackson.

Parades in the 1950s often in-
cluded Miss America and other
beauty queens.

And of course there is the
press attention that the Mock
Convention has received. Time
magazine calls it the ‘‘boo-
mingest of quadrennial campus
mass ventures into political pre-
diction,’’ and Newsweek labels it
“the most realistic.’” Tom
Sherwood of The Washington

 

WA&L News Office

Postwrote in 1984, ‘‘Forget Ca-
lifornia on July 5. Never mind
who will win in New Jersey. The
Democrats will nominate Walter
F, Mondale...’’ when reporting
the result of that year’s Mock
Convention.

Young, Robb, Clinton
selected as speakers

 

By Rob McPherson
Staff Reporter

 

Mayor Andrew Young of At-
lanta will get things started at the
1988 Mock Democratic Conven-
tion when he addresses the con-
gregation as the event’s keynote
speaker.

Young will speak on the morn-
ing of March 25 and will deliver
his speech just prior to the
choosing of candidates, said Les-
ter Coe, co-chairman of the con-
vention.

Traditionally, the keynote ad-
dress at a political convention
has been used to open the cere-
monies, usually in a dynamic
fashion. Coe said Young was as-
ked to deliver the speech because
of his ability to entertain and his
recognizable name.

‘*He’s a very dynamic speaker
who doesn’t hold back very
much,”’ said Coe.

In addition to Young, five
other prominent Democrats will
speak during the two-day long,
three session convention.

At the first session, Gov. Ger-
ald Baliles and Lt. Gov. Douglas
Wilder will speak along with

Gerald Baliles

sixth district U.S. Rep. Jim
Olin.

At the second session, former
governor of Virginia Charles
Robb will deliver the opening
address and Bill Clinton, the
governor of Arkansas, will de-
liver the platform address. Both
Robb and Clinton are powerful
Democrats, according to Coe.
He said Clinton is presently one
of the party’s top two choices for
vice-president.

Young’s speech and the choos-
ing of the candidates will make
up the third session.

Coe said the convention staff
had been working to get Sen.
Albert Gore of Tennessee as a
speaker and almost had him
scheduled for March 4.
However, according to Coe,
time limitations and Fancy Dress
caused scheduling problems.

‘*We had somewhat of an op-
portunity to get [Gore],’’ he
said, ‘‘but there were too many
things to be taken care of in too
short a period of time.”’

Coe said the Mock Conven-
tion is generally a respected
name and when someone from

the Mock Convention calls a
speaker, the speaker usually has
at least heard of the event.

‘*We have a lot of strong sell-
ing points,’’ Coe said.

“It seems that when we’re in
touch with someone they take a
long, hard look at us, even if
they have something sched-
uled,’” he added.

Coe said W&L’s location
sometimes presents a problem
because speakers can’t fly direc-
tly into Lexington.

**Sometimes, a speaker just
doesn’t have time to fly to Roan-
oke, drive 40 minutes, speak,
and drive back another 40
minutes,”’ he said.

According to Coe, the conven-
tion staff considered several
prominent Democrats in trying
to get speakers.

**Any big name you can think
of, we looked into it,’” he said.

“*You tend to pursue where
you think you have contacts.”’

The Mock Convention will
take place March 24 and 25. The
first and second sessions will be-
gin at 1:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.
respectively on the 24th. The
third session will begin at 9:30
a.m. on the 25th.

Conner: persistence is main research technique

 

By Wendy Wolford
Staff Reporter

 

One of the major tasks of the
Mock Convention Committee
involves researching the indivi-
dual states and the candidates in
order to successfully predict the
1988 Democratic presidential
nominee. According to Sam
Conner, chairman of the creden-
tials committee and coordinator
of the Upper South region, the
main research tactic is per-
sistence.

The long process begins with
each state chairman who must
develop contacts within his state,
keep up with the media and
gather enough information to

discover what kind of people live
in his area and which candidates
they are likely to support. The
Democratic party chairmen on
the state and national level usua-
lly provide a good starting point.

Contacts extend to reporters,
elected officials, political con-
sultants, and academics as well.
Porter Davis, regional coor-
dinator of the Midwest, finds
that ‘‘the state chairmen need to
establish a rapport with political
writers as well as the Democra-
tic national chairpersons. ”’

In interviewing national and
state organizations and contacts,
the researchers have an agenda
of issues to inquire about from
domestic to foreign affairs.
Their findings focus mainly on

demographic data, past voting
records, the media, and election
polls.

This year the work of the
committee has been assisted by
the Presidential Campaign Hot-
line. This computerized informa-
tion search provides a daily syn-
opsis of newspaper and maga-
zine articles as well as television

broadcasts by each state. Conner
believes this is an advantage to

the committee because ‘‘it saves
time and money by not having to
subscribe to the individual pub-
lications.”’

The next step in the research
process involves the efforts of
the regional coordinators. Ac-
cording to Rob Ryan, the

Eastern regional coordinator, his

‘primary responsibility is keep-
ing up with the state chairmen
and analyzing their research.”’
The five regional coordinators
correlate the information on the
states in their areas to determine
the more popular candidates.

Together, the state chairmen,
political directors and the five
regional coordinators put forth
an effort to determine which
candidate each state will support
after the research is complete.
Recent polls and primaries held
before the Mock Convention are
helpful in determining which
candidates to support as well.

Because the Mock Convention
is being held earlier this year,

some of the states’ primaries will

not be held until after the event is
over. Conner concluded, ‘‘be-
cause the primary season is
much hotter than in the past, the
convention takes more of an ed-
ucational and predictive effort.’’
There is also the added responsi-
bility of guaranteed confidentia-
lity when dealing with sources.

As the convention draws near,
the work of the committee inten-
Sifies. Persistence in gathering
research is indeed necessary.
Now that their jobs in research
are almost complete, the com-
mittee hopes to fulfill their main
objective which according to
Rob Ryan is ‘‘promoting authen-
ticity in choosing the right can-
didate.”’

Students work to put together a float.

Big floats, little floats, horse-
drawn floats and cars. This is the
Mock Convention state parade.

On Thursday, March 24 most
state delegations will begin
building their floats. Some states
may begin earlier, but the
majority of the states will begin
at 9:30 a.m. on Lexington High
School’s Brewbaker Field. All
floats must be on the field by 3
p.m. The parade begins at 10
a.m. on Friday and is scheduled
to last about two hours.

According to Mock Conven-
tion Parade Chairman Frank
Kannapel, the parade will begin
at Lexington High School on
Wallace Street, turn right on
Main Street, left on Washington
Street and end at Warner Center.
State congressman Jim Olin will
be the Parade Marshall.

The judges reviewing stand is
scheduled to be on the corner of
Main and Nelson streets. Kan-
napel said that there will be three
float judges and three band
judges.

The float judges will be from
the W&L Art Department and
the band judges will be from the
Music Department. Floats will
be judged on appearance and
will receive cash prizes.

First prize is $100; second,
$75; and third, $50. Bands will
be judged on marching ability
and music. The first three places
in each category will receive
trophies.

Kannapel said most of the area
high schools and middle school
bands will be participating in the
parade as well as the W&L
ROTC Color Guard. Lexington

_ nom ‘

Fire Department, the Liberty
Hall Volunteers and the Palme-
tto Sharp Shooters, a group of
Civil War re-enactment soldiers,
will also march down the parade
route.

Several of the larger states
have sent out material and held
phone-a-thons soliciting funds
for their state expenses. Both
California and Colorado have
sponsors that will help support
their Mock Convention endea-
vors. Kannapel said Coors is
sponsoring Colorado and a Cali-
fornia raisin company is spon-
soring California.

Most state delegations solicit
money from family and friends
of delegates and alumni in its
state. Smaller states and states
with few alumni might not able
to be as elaborate in their float
decorations due to lack of funds.

Such is the case with Puerto
Rico. Puerto Rico Float Chair-
man Anne Large said that the
delegation did not have much
money because there was only
one alumnus there. However,
she said that regardless of lack of
funds, the delegates were ‘‘hav-
ing fun and were putting a lot of
effort into it.’’ Large said the
theme would be something tro-
pical.

Another small delegation,
American Samoa, will share a
float with Guam and the U.S.
Virgin Islands, according to its
chairman, George Nomikos.

Iowa state chairman Bill Mad-
dox said Iowa will most likely
have some sort of farm oriented
theme. Maddox said he is hoping
to have four riders on horseback
from Hollins College. He said
each horse will have a plaque
with a letter spelling out Iowa.
Maddox said it was doubtful, but
he hoped his delegation could
get Miss Iowa 1987 to partici-
pate in the parade.

Several other states have been
very secretive about their float
ideas. New Jersey state chair
man Tom Eterogino said, ‘‘It’s a
secret, but you'll understand
why when you see it.’” New Jer-
sey’s float idea is so secretive
that Eterogino said only a selec-
ted few people in the delegation
knew what was to be done on the
float. We anxiously await New
Jersey’s float.

New York was also reluctant
to give away it’s float theme.
Chairman Don Thayer echoed
Eterogino saying “‘It’s a se-
cret.””

Wisconsin state chairman
Laurel Mattson said that since
Wisconsin’s two main industries
are beer and cheese, the float
would be centered around that
theme. Mattson said the dele-
gation has planned out the float
and hopes to complete some of
the work on it the weekend be-
fore the parade.

According to Indiana Float
Chairman Chris Coffland, the
delegation’s float is finished.
Coffland said, ‘“We just thought
of things that reminded us of In-
diana and centered our theme
around those ideas. We spent
$20.’ Laughing, Coffland ad-
ded, ‘‘Our grades might have
suffered, but...””

Elaborating on the dele-
gation’s float, Indiana delegate
Sam Obershain said, ‘‘There
will be one celebrity on the float
and various members of the stu-
dent body. We tried to get David
Letterman, but he called and
said he couldn’t make it.”’

Coffland said the delegation
hopes to raise some money today
with a kissing booth in the ODK
Circle. He added, **We’re look-
ing for Sam to bring in about
$1000.’’ Good luck Indiana.

Bourbon, buttons
are among
MC memorabilia

 

By Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

One of the biggest elements
involved in the Mock Conven-
tion is the financing. In addition
to telethons, alumni contribu-
tions, and individual state fund
raising, the selling of memorabi-
lia and concessions is a key to fi-
nancing this important political
event. This year, as in years
past, t-shirts, skimmer hats, Jim
Beam, posters, grain cups, and
buttons will be sold.

The T-shirts feature a design
by graphic artist Susan Behm
from Atlanta. The graphics in-
clude a keg in the back of a
BMW with two donkeys driving
past the capital and heading
towards Lexington. The designs
on the T-shirt pockets as well as
on the grain cups belong to
W&L senior Glen Smith. Smith
had included the acronym
LCWB in his original design be-
cause according to memorabilia
chairman Todd Barton, ‘‘This is
the last convention with an all
male class. We put it in as a
small statement, and we were
forced to remove it.””

Apparently, Valerie Pierson,
secretary of Mock Convention,
was offended by the acronym
and had it removed. The artist
and Barton were outraged.

Another popular item on sale
during Convention time is the
specially labeled Mock Conven-
tion Jim Beam. This bourbon
can only be purchased at the Va.

ABC Store located in Lexington.
Barton encountered a little diffi-
culty engineering the special or-
der of Beam, but through the
help of the ABC office in Rich-
mond, Barton ordered 100 cases
or 1200 of the special bottles.
Barton says that the Beam which
sells for 50-cents cheaper than
regular Jim Beam “‘is selling
fast.”

Barton hopes revenue from the
memorabilia and concession
sales will bring in between 5,000
and 10,000 dollars. The memor-
abilia will be on sale in the Uni-
versity Center on March 21 and
22 as well as on the 500-level of
the gym during the Convention.

Hot dogs, Pepsi, which is a
special sponsor of the event,
chips, and candy will be avail-
able in the concessions booth.
Packages of Convention memor-
abilia will be sold at reduced
rates.

The memorabilia is good qua-
lity, according to Barton. He
purchased the T-shirts from
Southeast Silk Screeners in Ath-
ens, Ga, the posters through
Anne Coulling in the W&L print
shop and Hickory Oaks Printing,
the grain cups from Louisiana
Plastics of St. Louis, the buttons
from Voters Unlimited in New
York, and the hats from Brown
and Bigelow.

Barton encourages students to
purchase Mock Convention
items because he says, ““There is
only one Mock Convention for
every W&L student and it will
be well worth remembering. ”’

International press to cover convention

By Abb Jones
Staff Reporter

 

Journalists from Egypt,
France, Japan, Lebanon, Qatar
and Saudi Arabia are among the
reporters currently scheduled to
cover the 1988 Mock Democra-
tic Convention.

According to Tim Bolling,
media chairman for the conven-
tion, the foreign journalists will
be covering the Mock Conven-
tion while attending a seminar at
W&L designed to help them gain
insight into the American Presi-
dential electorate process.

The seminar, titled ‘The Race
of 88°’, is being co- sponsored
by the Foreign Press Center of
the United States Information
Agency, the W&L Journalism
Department and the 1988 Mock
Democratic Convention.
Speakers will include Betty Cole
Dukert, producer of NBC’s
**Meet the Press’’, Ken Tomlin-
son, senior editor of ‘‘Reader’s
Digest’’>, W&L Journalism
Professor and Pulitzer prize
winner Clark Mollenhoff and
William Anderson of the USIA.

Bolling, a senior from Hun-
tington, W.Va., has been work-
ing since last year to raise inter-
est among the state and national

‘media regarding the convention.

**What we've done is gotten
together a mailing list of all the
newspapers in the state, all the

 

Jams

newspapers with daily bureaus
in Washington, the three major
networks, CNN and C-SPAN
and all the major news maga-
zines—Newsweek, Time and
U.S. News & World Report,”’
said Bolling.

Bolling said covering the
Mock Convention should be a
learning experience for the for-
eign journalists, since the con-
vention fairly accurately depicts
the actual convention, which the
journalists will be covering this
summer.

“‘The idea behind this is to
give foreign journalists who
aren’t used to getting outside of
the D.C. area a chance to expe-
rience first-hand what an actual
convention is like,’’ he said.

Last May, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson’s speech on the W&L
campus was the first major
media event involving the con-
vention. Bolling said the event
was covered by NBC Nightly
News and USA Today.

The news media, which is ex-
pected to be a group of 30 to 40
reporters, cameramen and other
assistants, will set up in the
wrestling room the Warner
Center—the site of the conven-
tion, said Bolling. During the
convention, the room will be
transformed into the press
center, stocked with phone lines
and podiums for press conferen-
ces.

 

The journalists covering the
convention will include repor-
ters from the Associated Press
and United Press International
news wire services, Westingh-
ouse Newsfeed, a national news
service which provides telev-
ision broadcast stories for the
nation’s TV stations, several
national and state TV and radio
stations and newspapers, The
Ring-tum Phi and WLUR, which

will present live gavel-to-gavel
coverage of the convention, be-
ginning with the 10 a.m. parade
Friday, March 25.

Bolling also said the conven-
tion’s final results will be sent to
several political research pub-

lications for possible future
scholarly research and pub-
lication.

Scheduled speakers for the
convention include Atlanta

Mayor and former U.S. rep-
resentative to the U.N., Andrew
Young, Virginia Gov. Gerald
Baliles, former Gov. Chuck
Robb and Arkansas Gov. Wil-
liam Clinton.

Bolling said that as the con-
vention receives final commit-
ment from remaining possible
speakers more journalists will
plan on arriving in Lexington to
cover the convention.

First rule of being a delegate
is to enjoy the convention

 

By Andy Nixon
Staff Reporter

 

With the W&L Mock Conven-
tion rapidly approaching, the
time has arrived to mobilize the
vast amount of delegates who
will crowd the floor of the con-
vention.

The first rule of participating
as a delegate, as said by the state
chairman Eugene Stephens of
North Carolina, is ‘‘to sit back
and enjoy, because most of the
work is already done.’’ The fact
is that the money has been raised
by the state committees, contacts
have been made, and the phone-

a-thons are over.

There are, however, certain
things that delegates can be do-
ing to increase their involvement
in the convention. The most ob-
vious thing is to simply be
aware, With all the candidates
and primaries that have occurred
within the past few months, a
knowledge of the candidates, is-
sues, and state’s opinion would
help. As chairman of New York,
Jim Sloat, stated, ‘‘the delegates
should know how the delegates
fit into the bigger picture.”’

A second function delegates
participate in is the building of
state floats for the convention
parade. States have spent a great

deal of time raising money, part
of which is designated for the
construction of floats. State
delegation will also have parties
during the weekend of the con-
vention which, of course, dele-
gates are encouraged to attend.
State delegation meetings will
be held in the near future in or-
der to coordinate all the final
preparations for the convention.
And while little knowledge is
needed for float building or at-
tending parties, knowledge of
the candidates and the current
status of the 1988 campaign cer-
tainly will help the chances of
W&L holding yet another suc-
cessful Mock Convention.

Journalists to attend seminar

 

From Staff Reports

 

W&L will host a seminar for
foreign journalists on the 1988
presidential election campaign
March 24 at 3 p.m. in Northen
Auditorium.

The seminar, entitled ‘‘The
Race of '88’’, is sponsored by
the Foreign Press Center of the
United States Information
Agency, the W&L Department
of Journalism and Communica-
tions, and the 1988 Mock De-
mocratic Convention.

Panelists include Ken Tomlin-
son, senior editor of Reader's
Digest; Betty Cole Bukert, pro-
ducer of NBC News’ long-
running Meet the Press; Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist Clark
R. Mollenhoff, of the W&L
Journalism Department; and
several W&L journalism stu-
dents. The panel moderator will
be William F. Anderson, of the
USIA Foreign Press Center.

Prof. John K. Jennings,
Chairman of the W&L Journal-
ism Department, said that the
event represented a very positive
joint effort between the USIA
and W&L.

‘*We are very pleased to work
with the United States Informa-
tion Agency in setting up a sym-
posium for foreign journa-
lists,’’ said Jennings. “‘It is, in-
deed, a fortunate bit of timing
that the symposium takes place
on the eve of the 1988 Mock
Democratic Convention. ”’

The Mock Democratic Con-
vention gets underway the fol-
lowing day, Friday, March 25,
in the Warner Center on the
W&L campus.

The seminar was set up to al-
low foreign journalists to gain
insight into the many compli-
cated factors that go into the
election of a U.S. president. As
many, W&L is perhaps uniquely
qualified to host such an event,
said Tim A. Bolling, a senior,
and Media Chairman of the
Mock Convention.

“‘W&L has the twin benefits
of having the oldest school of
journalism in the country, and
the Mock Convention, which is
an unsurpassed predictor of
presidential politics.’’, said Boll-
ing. ‘‘But we also take pride in
the level of authenticity at the

Mock Convention. We accurate-
ly duplicate all aspects of a real
nominating convention.”’

This level of realism makes
organizers confident that they
will be able to offer such unique
insights into the factors that will
determine the future leadership
of the U.S.

“‘The convention should give
the foreign journalists a good
preview of the real thing to take
place this summer in Atlanta."’,
said Jennings.

News organizations already
scheduled to participate in the
seminar include the Voice of
America, which is broadcast
throughout the world, one of the
largest TV networks in Japan,
and leading news organizations
from France, Saudi Arabia, Qa-
tar, Lebanon, and Egypt.

The financial organization of
the 1988 Mock Democratic
Convention has successfully
reached its fund raising goals.
Preparation and organization
have eliminated problems in the
areas of fund raising and funding
the convention. Spending has
been frugal in previous months
to insure a good position at the
time of the convention, says
Treasurer Brad Watkins.

The committee used innova-
tive measures to raise money and
has exceeded the 1984 conven-
tion by more than $2,000, even
though this year’s falls earlier in
the school calender.

The budget, roughly
$136,000, comes from a vast
number of sources and finances
every aspect of the convention.
The Executive Committee de-
signated $25,000 to the conven-
tion from its budget of the Stu-
dent Activities Fees.

The Hatton W. Sumners
Foundation of Dallas, Texas
contributes to the convention
every four years by donating the
interest drawn off its principle;
this year it yielded $32,000.

Through organized mailings
and a phone-a-thon, approxi-
mately $45,000 has been raised.

Funds came primarily from
alumni, parents, and businesses.
The timing of the convention’s
fund raising was carefully
spaced with those of the de-
velopment office in order to
maintain good donor relations
for the university.

T-shirt and memorabilia sales
raise roughly $15,000. Adver-

tisements in the journal draw
$4,000. The convention relies
on each of the states to share a
large responsibility of the fund
raising.

Each state must raise a mini-
mum of funds that is designated
by the treasurer according to the
state’s size and number of dele-
gates. Each state chairman
received listings of parents and
alumni living in their state. The
states raise money to cover their
own expenses such as float con-
struction and political research;
the states also give to the trea-
sury of the general convention.

The steering committee esti-
mated the various expenses of
the convention and organized a
budget accordingly. Guest
speakers and the expenses of fa-
cilities, operations, and security
consume a large portion of the
funds. Committee operations
and political research also make
demands on the budget.

This year the Mock Conven-
tion office uses one of the uni-
versity’s IBM computers and a
Hewlett Packard Laser Printer at
the cost of one year’s deprecia-
tion.

Finance Chairman, Jim Met-
calfe designed a computer ac-
counting program for the
finances of the individual states
and the general convention. It al-
lows the finance committee to
make daily updates of the dona-
tions recieved. The committee
has also compiled a mailing list
of donors to help the next con-
vention.

The treasury finances the pub-
lication of the Mock Convention
Report as well as the correspon-
dence with the media and the
community.
