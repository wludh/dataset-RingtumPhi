Another rush has come and gone at Wash-
ington & Lee University, and an estimated total
of 377 new pledges will be joining W&L frater-
nities or sororities this year. While numbers
from this year’s rush do not differ signiﬁcantly
from last year’s, there are some notable differ-
ences between the number of students who
chose to pledge each individual fraternity.

The most obvious difference was in the
pledgeship at fraternity Phi Gamma Delta. While
Fiji reaped 13 pledges last year, an astonishing
25 freshmen chose to pledge Phi Gamma Delta
in 2003, making them the fraternity to gain the
largest number of pledges in 2003. The frater-
nity that had the biggest dropoff in number of
pledges from last year was Kappa Alpha, which
dropped to 10 pledges this year from 20 last
year. Overall, the fraternities that took in the
fewest pledges in 2003 were Sigma Nu and Phi
Kappa Psi, each of which took in four pledges
each. On "the sorority side, the biggest gainer
this year over last was Pi Beta Phi, who took in
27 pledges, six more than last year’s total, though
Kappa Kappa Gamma and Kappa Alpha Theta
gained the most overall new members, at 38
each. On the whole, the sorority that took in
the fewest pledges as compared to last year was
Chi Omega, who took in one less from last year ’s
total of 37. The sorority which took in the few-
est pledges overall was Pi Beta Phi. Overall,
nine Greek organizations gained more pledges
this year than last, eight gained fewer pledges
this year than last, and three remained the same.

An interesting development was the num-
ber of sophomores who pledged sororities this
year. Under the Panhellenic Council’s rules,
sororities may take a quota of 36 new pledges
each year. However, each sorority is also al-
lowed sophomores who do not count towards
this total. This rule was implemented to allow a
more easy process of pledgeship for sophomore
women. As of press time, three of the five so-
rorities had taken advantage of this rule; Kappa
Kappa Gamma took two new sophomores,
Kappa Delta took one, and Kappa Kappa Tlfeta
took three.

In the class of 2006 as a whole, approxi-
mately 80 percent of freshman men pledged a
fraternity, whereas 72 percent of freshman
women pledged a sorority; these are approxi-
mately the same percentages as those of upper-
classmen who belong to a Greek organization.
Both numbers are up from the 2002 rush, when
78 percent of the male freshman class pledged,
and 71 percent of the freshman women pledged.

As is the case during every year, the IF C
and the Panhellenic Council oversaw the pro-
cess to ensure a fair rush process for both the
rushees and the Greek organizations involved.
The rushing duties of these supervisory orga-
nizations, whose leaders and members often
work late into the night during Rush week to
ensure an optimal pledge placement, will now
focus on overseeing the two-month long
pledgeship period.

three-alarm fire at the Robert E. Lee Building in downtown
Lexington. The fire broke out in a tenant’s apartment at 10:45 p.m.
on Friday. No injuries were reported and the tenant was not in his
room when the blaze occured, but Lexington Fire Chief Robert
Foresman reported that there was smoke damage to the second
floor and nearly all the occupant’s personal belongings were destroyed
at an estimated cost of $25,000.

Preliminary inspection indicated that the room’s smoke alarm was

' not activated. According to Foresman, the building is not required to

have an active sprinkler system under city fire code. Officer Mark
Reilly, who was first on the scene, reported that all the residents were
evacuated to the first floor and all traffic on Main Street was blocked
until after 12:30 am. The cause of the fire is unknown, yet both
Reilly and Foresman have reason to believe no foul play was
involved.—-Andrew Latirner / staff writer

Winter welcome week
provides Greekalternative

BY Km WASS
STAFF WRITER

As an alternative to fraternity and sorority
recruitment, Each day of the last week, students
had a chance to participate in Winter Welcome
Week. The event included activities ranging
from a comedian to free dessert and coffee to
laser tag.

This is the first year that Washington and
Lee has had an official Winter Welcome Week,
although last year Susan Slopek also organized
activities through the Games Club during rush
week for those not participating in recruitment.
However, the series of events were “nothing of
this magnitude,” said Jeffrey Meriggi, one of the
organizers of Winter Welcome Week. The events
were also organized by Slopek, Outing Club co-
ordinator James Dick and Director of University
Activites Teresa Glassman. The events took
place during the week of January 6-1 1.

The activities, which were open to the
entire student body, included comedian
Rich Ragains performing on Monday night,
with free dessert and coffee at the GHQ, then
movie night at the State Theater on Tues-
day. Any W&L student received free ad-
mission to a movie that night by showing
his ID card. The International House hosted
a band party on Wednesday night with
Right On. Freshman Halin Bareke said it
was, “a cover band with a Motown theme.”
Thursday the Outing Club helped open a

high elements rope course in the pavilion
followed by s’mores and hot chocolate at
their house in Davidson Park. One of the
highlights of the week was laser tag on Fri-
day night in Salem. Dean Courtney Penn
played with his son and a upperclass stu-
dents. Bare e said there was also a game
room where tudents could play mini-golf
and Wheel- f-Fortune. He said the night
was, “pretty fun.” On Saturday night, the
Winter Welcome Week organizing commit-
tee sponsored “Neon Nights” bowling at
Lexington Lanes, followed by late night
pizza and a movie.

Bareke also noted that it was mostly
upperclassman who participated, since the ma-
jority of freshman spent a very busy last week
at the sorority and fraternity houses during for-
mal recruitment.

Additionally, on Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Thursday, nights, dinner was moved to
the GHQ from the D-hall, which closed for the
Winter Welcome Week events. Meriggi said
that “for the whole week the meals are sort of
stepped up or made more interesting where
possible.” The monotony-breaking meals in-
cluded themes like Mexican night and Wok
night.

The events provided an excellent oppor-
tunity for students who were not participat-
ing in rush week to have fun by providing
them with alternate social opportunities,
Bareke said.

W&L alum collapses, dies

FROM STAFF AND WIRE REPORSTS

Charles P. Monroe, Ar1ington’s first black
circuit court judge died Saturday aﬁer suffering
from a brain aneurysm during his first meeting
as chairman of the Arlington County Board.

Monroe, a native of northern Virginia,
graduated from Washington and Lee Univer-
sity law school and was a lawyer with Alexan-
dria-based Duncan and Hopkins.

“He was one of the kindest, fairest people I
think any of us ever met,” said Vice Chairman
Paul Ferguson. “He loved Arlington County, his
job and his fami1y...He approached every issue
with an open mind.”

Monroe was responding to a resident’s
concern at the Board meeting when he repeated

a sentence, fell silent and then slumped to one
side in his chair. Paramedics took him to Virginia
Hospital Center-Arlington, where he was pro-
nounced dead at 12:07 p.m. Saturday.

“Serving on the County Board for Charles
was about service to the county, not for any
personal political ambition,” said Dan Steen,
chairman of the Arlington Democratic Commit-
tee. “This is a shock to all of us. . . . He had plans
to serve the county in so many ways.”

Monroe was 46 and a human rights activ-
ist. He planned to get rid of Ar1ington’s 50 most
dilapidated properties. He was also a member of
the Arlington Human Rights Commission and
the Arlington Housing Corp. board.

Whence the Mollenhoff tree?

The Phi, more than any other organization
on campus, welcomes the new Reid Hall. Fu-
ture Phi staffers, journalists and writers of ev-
ery type will be well-served by its ceramic tile
lobby, space-age desks and giant ﬂat screen
television.

We’re also very excited that with the
completion of the John W. Elrod University
Commons, the 99 year-old plan to create a sec-
ond colonnade will become a reality. However,
all is not rosey as W&L nears the end of its
“For the Rising Generation” construction binge.

In 1993, The Ring-tum Phi planted a tree
on Stemmons Plaza behind Reid Hall to me-
morialize journalism Professor Clark R.
Mollenhoff. In the days before we had our es-
teemed competition, he lead our inexperienced
team of writers to (then twice weekly) turn out
a paper of record of which W&L could be
proud.

Sadly, there is no longer a Mollenhoff Me-
morial tree behind Reid Hall to lend shade to
passing students; only a ﬂat, featureless lawn
remains. Where has the Mollenhoff tree been
taken? And what symbols of our treasured past
will next fall to the cold steel of progress in a
bulldozer’s blade?

Will the Cy Twombly Pool be paved over
and those memories fade, too, like so many
escaping ripples? Will Wilson Field be replaced
with nameless AstroTurf and the recollections
of games won and lost sodded over like dam-
aged turf?

We are the first ones to welcome the mod-
ernization and improvement brought by the new
construction. But let’s not forget our past in
our zeal to embrace the future. They may take
our tree, but they’ll never take our memories.

GONE , BUT NOT
FORGOITEN .Prof.r

Trent Lott s  moron, no a racist

As a conservative, I sometimes won-
der about the Republicans’ proclivity for
ﬁatricide (no, fiatricide does not mean “mur-
dering fraternity members”). The latest ex-
ample has come in the form of the Incred-
ible Shrinking Senator, Trent Lott.

Of course, Sen. Lott’s wounds were
largely self-inﬂicted: he waxed nostalgic
and publicly wished that then-segregation-
ist Strom Thurmond had become President
in 1948, so “we wouldn’t have all these
problems today.”

Since the Dixiecrat platform was a little
light on issues such as national defense
and economic stimulus (unless you count

1 I1 -

RIGHT  creased

c govem-

OHN HEATH 04 men, in_

vestment on the construction of separate
schools and water fountains as economic
stimulus), it might be logical to assume that
Sen. Lott wished to return to the Jim Crow
days.

Lott’s mortal sin, as the media so
fondly repeats ad nauseum was blatant,
unapologetic racism. Or was it? The now-
infamous remarks were delivered on the
occasion of Sen. Thurmond’s 100“‘ birth-
day; Sen. Lott was merely attempting to
pay tribute to an institutional icon. After
the usual hyperventalations of the main-
stream (read: liberal) media and Jessie J ack-
son-types, this mini-scandal might have
withdrawn quietly into the night. The force
keeping this story alive, however, was the
conservative media.

If the liberal chattering class was will-
ing to let go, why did the likes of the Na-
tional Review and The Weekly Standard
persist? The answer is bigger than a birth-
day party faux pas: Trent Lott has always
had an uneasy relationship with the Re-
publican Party. His unwittingly pr0-segre-

gationist comments were merely the straw
that broke the camel’s back. Sen. Lott’s sup-
port in the party was wide, but shallow; as
others have said, there are no “Trent Lott
Republicans.”

As a Republican leader, Trent Lott
never struck the right balance. He achieved
the double feat of angering conservatives

by appearing too eager to strike deals with
the big—govemment Democrats, while at
the same time projecting a scary, neo-con-
servative image to the suburban Republi-
can moderates. And when the opportu-
nistic Senator Jim Jeffords announced that
he was going to side with the Dems and
rob the Republicans of the control of the

Senate, Sen. Lott appeared ﬂummoxed and
ﬂabbergasted. And while it is unfair to lay
the blame for Sen. Jeffords’ party-switch at
Trent Lott’s feet, his babe-in—the-woods act
didn’t sit well with many conservatives,
who wondered how the leader of the Sen-
ate could be so soundly asleep at the wheel.

For the majority of Republicans and
conservatives who had tentatively for-
given, but not forgotten, the Jeffords ﬁ-
asco, Sen. Lott’s preening after his
Thurmond comments was too much to bear.

When the media began piling on, Sen.
Lott caved, and effectively dug his own grave.
In an interview on BET, he had an opportu-
nity to provide a legitimate, non-racist de-
fense for opposing affirmative action pro-
grams (there is deﬁnitely such a defense).
Instead, Sen. Lott continued his pander-thon
by pronouncing his desire to strongly pro-
mote the program. As Jon Stewart jokingly
said, “It’s bad enough Sen. Lott’s a racist,
now we ﬁnd out he’s a liberal!”

With the opportunity to choose a new
leader for the first time in six years, the GOP
Senators faced a historic opportunity to
choose a more effective Senate leader. The
economic conservatives desperately
wanted Lott to be replaced with supply-
side aficionado Don Nickles, but his role
as Brutus in the palace coup prevented any
ascension to Majority Leader. Instead, the
Republicans have settled on Bill Frist of
Tennessee, the Dudley Doright dujour of
the GOP, to pull the Senate majority out of
the Lott quagmire. Sen. Frist proved his
ability to stumble into good headlines as
the physician provided medical attention
to victims of a car crash just days before
his ascension to Majority Leader. If Sen.
Frist can stand fast by the bedrock prin-
ciples of the Republican party, the Senate
should recover quickly from this unusual
institutional skirmish.

where the dent really

official can do is mercilessly
oppress dissidents.

Alas, in our
University’s never-ending
discussion and reinterpre-
tation of what “honor” is,
there seems to have arisen
some disagreement.
Chieﬂy, students seem to be
unhappy with the honor
system when it inconve-
niences them.

Michael Denbow
wrote in The Trident that
using a fake ID shouldn’t
be grounds for expulsion.
Nor does the prevailing
opinion seem to be that
sexual crimes should fall
under the purview of the EC.
Students are eager to enjoy
the beneﬁts of the system,
such as unproctored exams
and the freedom to leave
one’s door unlocked, but no
one is willing_to step up and
accept even the minor de-
mands honor makes on our
daily lives. One would
hope, in fact, that the call to
live an honorable life would
be met and recognized as
its own reward, not criti-
cized as an overly broad
stricture on a 215' century
student’s hedonism.

As such, the EC was
absolutely correct to expel
foruse of a fakelD—it’s sim-
ply lying. There is no room
for interpretation. The stu-
dent was willfully attempt-
ing to deceive a law—abid-

couldn’t he have found one
at his favorite fraternity
house?

This, of course, leads
to a discussion of the regu-
lar underage drinking that
occurs with, from Dean
Watkins’ point of view, dis-
tressing frequency. But,
such consumption is not an
honor violation because all
parties involved are fully
aware of what is taking
place. The underage stu-
dent knows he is underage
and the bartender knows
that the student is under-
age. There is no lying in-
volved. The disrespect
done by both parties to a
silly and paternalistic state
authority is certainly not
dishonorable.

Another major area of
concern is the downloading
of music from the internet.
Using Kazaa or similar pro-
grams is also not an honor
violation. Similarly, neither
is taping music from the ra-
dio, borrowing music from
friends, or checking out
CD’s from the library. Only
if one profits from others’
works by selling compila-
tions of downloaded music
would this behavior be dis-
honorable, much as plagia-
rism is.

Perhaps most impor-
tantly, the SFHB should
pass on convicts to the EC.

‘ Few acts are more dishon-

orable or display a grosser
lack of character than the
abuse of a lady. Frankly, the

fact that there isn’,t a gen-

eral outcry from the student
body for these lowlifes to be
cast from our midst is both
surprising and disappoint-
ing.

Another question that
had been raised is the ﬁt-
ness of EC members who
may have committed honor
violations in the past. Natu-
rally, they are under no com-
punction to acquit those
who may come before them.
We, students, elected them
to administer the honor code
regardless of past mistakes.

Finally, the above is
not to demonstrate that the
honor system is perfect.
Brett Burns raises an excel-
lent point when he calls for
more transparency in EC
proceedings. The EC
should publish more com-

plete reports of its deci- .

sions, listing the votes of
each member and his rea-
son for deciding the way
he did. All of the Supreme
Court’s deliberations and
questions are also private,
but afterwards, the public
knows why the justices ar-
rived at their decision. This
is especially important
when elections occur. Stu-
dents deserve a record of
how their representatives
discharged their most im-
portant duty.

I would venture to say
that the honor system,
unique for its history, efﬁ-
cacy and pervasiveness, at-
tracts and retains many stu-
dents. Let us not be made
lazy by the common permis-
siveness and
nonjudgmentalism of our
time. General Lee would re-
quire nothing less. 0

KEWL calls
for women
in administration

Tovtlfe 'adin;in‘islf"ra'tii(")ifo’f if 

Washington and Lee
University:

Washington and Lee
University has an incom-
parable history. The mem-
bers of KEWL (Knowledge
Empowering Women Lead-
ers) think the University
can be unparalleled, pend-
ing some major changes.
The University has made
great strides in overcom-
ing some of the negative
aspects of its history. Yet

while W&L has improved,
it remains a work in
progress.’

Ethnic, socioeco-
nomic, racial and gender
diversity increased

steadily over the past eigh-
teen years, along with the
recruitment of students
from all across the United
States and the world. Un-
fortunately, our administra-
tion, faculty and staff do
not reﬂect a similar pattern
of diversity.

 Reservatio

As representatives of
a signiﬁcant portion of the
student body, the KEWL
organization asks that you
help make the University a
more diverse communigl by
v -v,-rr "5'-e““».'1,:_"‘ J5
seriously considering

it

qualiﬁed women and other ‘

minorities while filling the
ﬁve vacant positions in the
upper administration and
staff. We recognize that
women are
underrepresented in a num-
ber of departments within
the University, on the
Board of Trustees, in higher
level staff positions and at
the top level of the admin-
istration. This problem is
detrimental to the Univer-
sity in several ways: our fe-
male students lack adequate
role models within the ad-
ministration; our male stu-
dents do not have the op-
portunity to observe
women and other minorities
in executive positions; and
every student suffers from
an unintentional male bias
within the administration.
We wonder if this situation
also affects our overall ap-
peal to potential faculty and
students. Many of our stu-

dents receive an erroneous
message that the predomi-
nantly white male adminis-
tration reﬂects the make-up
of society. Therefore, as the
\go‘rl‘_(‘l beyond 3W(,as,.hington_
and Lee University is diver-
sifies in gender and
ethnicity, Washington and
Lee cannot afford to be left
behind.

The ofﬁcers, members
and advisors of KEWL
strongly urge the placement
of one or several qualiﬁed
applicants who embody
gender and racial diversity
for the following positions:
Dean of the College, Vice
President of Administra-
tion, Dean of Students, Di-
rector of the New Univer-
sity Commons and Head
Librarian. If our University
is determined to commit to
its agenda of coeducation
and diversiﬁcation, then
this goal must be reﬂected
in the administration.

Sincerely,

The Ofﬁcers of KEWL

BY HAYNES KING
TRAVEL CORRESPONDENT

During Winter Term at W&L, many
students need a break from the pressure

3 of the semester and the monotony of

campus life. If you are looking for
something new, you might want to take
a look to our northern neighbor,
Charlottesville. Here one can find many

V opportunities to keep busy.

The trip includes a breathtaking
drive through the Blue Ridge over Aﬁon
Mountain If you are lucky enough to be
traveling on a clear day, I would suggest
stopping at an overlook. If you are a
photographer, stop to take photos of this
view. Better yet, if you’re looking to
impress someone, this atmosphere will

I make you appear sensitive and romantic.

My trip included a tour of Thomas
J efferson’s own Monticello and James
Monroe’s Ashlawn-Highland. If you
want to waste your time and money,
go ahead; take a look at Monroe’s
house. I did not ﬁnd the tour or the
house impressive; however, if you do
have the time to kill, I guess there is no

V’ reason not to see it. The highlight is

the picturesque front drive lined with
oak trees. I do recommend a trip to
Monticello. Jefferson designed the
house himself, and it is listed on the
United Nations World Heritage List,as
the only personal residence on the
renowned list. You can take a tour of

in BROO Tl IE RlNCr'l‘Ul\l PHI

PRESIDENTIAL DwE1_uN<;s : Monticello and Ashlawn-Highland (inset) are just two
of the many attractions to be found in charming, historic Charlottesville, Virginia

the house, along with its plantations
and gardens. After you have finished
your tour, there is a nice walk from the
house back to the parking area. On
this trail, you can see the graveyard
of Jefferson and his family.

Also in the area is Jefferson’s
University ofV1rginia Althoughan inferior
institution of higher learning when
compared to W&L, J efferson’s design of
the Rotunda proves a statuesque building.

The downtown area provides
quaint shops and eateries. I would
suggest the Irish Pub. I enjoyed classic
ﬁsh and chips. But if someone else is
paying for your meal, the Michie
Tavern is delectable. This restaurant

serves a traditional l8‘“ century buffet
including fried chicken, black-eyed
peas, stewed tomatoes, and apple pie
for dessert. The tavern has a general
store and gift shop to purchase many
souvenirs for adults and children.
Tours of the 1784 tavern are available.

Although Charlottesville is
similar to historic Lexington, the size
offers a great escape on a Saturday.

Bottom line, Charlottesville gets
4 out of 5 stars for a day trip with
friends. But as a date with someone
you want to impress, it gets 5. The
scenic drive and charm of quaint
Charlottesville makes it a wonderful
out of town date.

A journey anticipated
In childhood dreams
So gladly, eagerly, impatiently,
Should cover all there is.
Ornitting nothing created or dreamed of.
There should be time for all of life.

‘I Before its end.

And no regrets.

No aches of doubt

No symphony unﬁnished.

Race the shadow.

He will not stay

Nor time forgive

Those who hesitate to live.

This powerful poem was written by
Cullum Owings’ paternal grandmother

Helen Cullum Owings. It opened “A
Celebration of the life of S. Culltun Owings”
held at the Cathedral of Christ the King
Church inAtlanta on December 5.

For those of us who were privileged
to attend this memorable, heartbreaking
event, Mrs. Owings’ eloquent words
captured the spirit of Cullum, his wonderful
family, and his many friends from
Westminster and Washington and Lee.

Rush Week exempliﬁes best, worst of W&L

There’s no question about it. Out of the 30 weeks
we spend in Lexington each school year, the most
important is Rush Week. For fraternities and sororities,
it represents the climax of an entire term of behind-the-
scenes work and endless discussions. For freshmen,
it represents the beginning of their second life at W&L,
as they ofﬁcially enter the fabled Greek System that
makes this school what it is. But what on the surface
seems so simple is, in reality, the most dramatic series
of days of the school year. The routine of Rush Week
tests every personality and evokes every emotion
imaginable. For one stressful week, the Greek System
takes control of the entire university and shows us all

' the best aspects and worst features of life in Lexington.

The horrors of Rush Week are certainly not
pretty...

Consider the potential for psychological damage
inherent in the Rush Week process. Essentially, each
fraternity and sorority takes a vote on
whether or not a candidate is
acceptable enough to share their
company. This, in itself, is nauseating.
But when this is considered with the
knowledge that the Greek System is about all we have
in Lexington, we realize that the outcome of our votes
reﬂects more or less our decision on the course of a
candidate’s entire life at W&L. Disgustingly, we
decide for them how their college experience will turn
out. In some cases, students have transferred after
not getting accepted into any houses — tragically,
fraternity or sorority members basically decided that
such a person was not ﬁt for W&L.

The outcomes of Rush Week should not be
underestimated; for some people, it represents a quite
crucial turning point in the entirety of their lives. But
this fact becomes even more ridiculous in the face of the
thought processes that are prevalent in bid sessions.
Thousands of factors determine your acceptability to
Greek members — the way you look, the way you dress,
the car you drive, the amount of money your parents
have, the friends you keep, or even the state (or country)
you come from. Its not tough to see that the voting
process boils down to one simple truth: your entire
experience at W&L can be subject to the decision of
one superﬁcial jerk.

It doesn’t get any easier on the Greek side of
things. There are rivalries between houses. There are
rivalries within houses. Bid sessions can resemble the
atmosphere of the stock exchange ﬂoor — all sorts of

ABs6iniE‘iFRA“Ti6RD
TIM SMITH ‘04

deals are made concerning the possible “investments.”

Tears are shed. Punches are thrown. Houses can split
apart and come together several times in one simple
four-hour period. Through it all, the IF C works behind
the scenes to make sure that rules are kept and to
attempt to ﬁnd a home for every person (big props to
Matt Jacobs and the IFC for your time and effort).
Fraternities and sororities certainly aren’t immune to
the superﬁciality and self-consciousness either, as each

house asks if it is good enough to attract an impressive

group of new guys or girls. Sometimes these feelings
reﬂect temporary fears, but often Greek members are
left considering their own personal failures.

With the right attitude, however, there can be a
light at the end ofthe tunnel. First ofall, it should be
said that despite all the criticism it receives, the Greek
System of W&L is possibly the most inclusive on the
planet. Each house is so different that there is virtually

a place for anyone. The bid process

 in itself could easily be considered

elitist, but there are certainly houses

that are willing to extend many
opportunities.

For the houses, the result of all the debates is a
new class of recruits that every member agrees are
worthy of their house. There might be lingering
doubts, but the period of bonding that follows Rush
Week reminds us all of what being in a Greek
organization is all about.

In cases when a person does not get accepted
anywhere, there is some clear good to be extracted
from the rejection: its not that you aren’t good enough
— it means simply that there are aspects of your
behavior or personality that seriously need reflecting
upon. Every person has their own faults, and though
we’d prefer to not have them pointed out so
dramatically, the key is to make an honest effort to
correct them.

Maybe our lives would be easier if Rush Week
didn’t exist. Maybe if we couldjust pick names out
ofa hat, we could bypass all the stress and emotion
that can take us to the edge. But then there would
be no feeling of accomplishment, and Greek life
would be meaningless. Indeed, with all its positives
and negatives, Rush Week shows us many of the
important things about being a student of W&L. Yet,
even more importantly, Rush Week reveals features
of our own personalities and motivates us to improve

ourselves.
