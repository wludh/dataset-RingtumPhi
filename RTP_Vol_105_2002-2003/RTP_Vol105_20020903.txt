Move-in mania

Upperclassmen, administrators help freshmen move into rooms, adjust to colleg

BY KATIE HOWELL
EDITOR IN (illlEl‘

Though University Commons
construction limited parking and pe-
destrian space, freshmen moved into
their dorm rooms without trouble.

“Everything’s going great,” said
Dawn Watkins, dean of freshmen.

Watkins said the Class of 2006, I

with 460 students, is one of the larg-
est in Washington and Lee’s his-
tory.

After Move-In Day, the freshman
began Orientation. which will end with
class on Thursday. The Freshman
Program also began, with a dinner in
Evans Dining Hall. The Freshman Pro-
gram, an extended process of famil-
iarization, will continue throughout
the academic year.

“Move-in went really smoothly,”
said junior dorm counselor Bill
Gilsenan. “All my guys got moved in
with no problem by 1200.”

Some freshmen and dorm coun-
selors thought the rule prohibiting
cinder blocks to raise beds hindered
the move-in process.

i “It seems odd,” said freshman
Reed Evans. “I don’t understand why
they’re not doing it.”

Others, however, thought this
new rule was not a problem.

“I never planned on bringing
(cinder blocks),” said freshman Tom
Borda. “I brought some bedposts, and
they work just as well.”

Freshmen orientation activities
are continuing today and tomorrow
with Honor System orientation, reg-
istration, Big Brother/Big Sister din-
ner and matriculation. A

“I’m really excited about every-
thing,” said freshman Liz Bidinger.

EVERYBODY WAS KUNG FU FIGHTING. Excitement runs high as employees ofthe Physical Plant gear up
for the inﬂux of freshmen, their parents and their belongings.

 

W&L is great,
but I’m not much for my room.
— REED EVANS, GREENSBORO, NC

 

I talked on the phone with my
roommate before school,
but I haven’t met him yet.
It’s going to be a neat experience.

I thought about bringing cinder
blocks, but my roommate came early,
and she called to let me know
we couldn’t.

I have a great room with two

much space I actually have.

I thought I would be
crammed in here.

BURLY BURISI-I. Washington and Lee’s new president,
’' Thomas Burish, works alongside FOC members to help

freshmen move into their dormitories.

BY MATTHEW MCDERMOTT
EDITOR IN CHIEF

As demands of a new office will keep University
President Thomas Burish busy during the day, he in-
tends to meet students at night.

Burish “hopes students will visit him when the
light’s on in his office,” said Dean of Students David
Howison. The president has arranged for University
Security to leave Washington Hall unlocked whenever
he stays late.

“When I’m busy, that may mean that I have to
work in my office with a flashlight,” Burish said, “Ac-
tually, then I’ll probably just work at home.”

As university president, Burish resides in Lee House.

Burish also plans on more structured meetings.
He intends to meet monthly with heads of student
organizations.

“When I came to campus, I noticed that student
leaders didn’t have a chance to talk to one another,”
Burish said. The proposed meetings would allow the
president to guage student opinion and hear concerns
directly.

Burish also hopes to meet monthly with different
student groups.

“For example, at the end of the year, I would like to
meet with soon—to-graduate seniors, to discuss their
experience at W&L,” Burish said.

—An in-depth look at administrative changes
will appear in the Phi’s next issue.

Hi. Welcome to Washington
and Lee.

I don’t go to school there, but
I hear it’s nice.

I don’t know personally. I attend
the other small liberal arts college in
Lexington.

It’s different here. For one thing.

ﬁrst—year students here don’t worry
about the freshman ﬁfteen, ba—dump—
ching. (That’s my first hilarious joke.
This is the point during your orienta-
tion that you nudge the guy or gal
next to you and say, “Dude, check this
out. Sam LaGrone is as funny as a one-
legged guy playing wall ball.”)

So our schools are smack dab in
the middle of the city, butted up next
to each other. I like to imagine it’s a
pizza with a different topping on each
side. On your side it’s white cheese,
with delicate shitaki mushrooms. Our
half is gravel and bared wire.

    

Oh so rusty barbed wire.

Given the tendency of our
schools to communicate by glares, the
likelihood that any of you will talk to
a cadet is slim to fat chance. So we’ll
go over some frequently mused ques-
tions.

Q: Is VMI hard ?

A: It depends who you ask. Rats will
say it’s rough, but they mange to ﬁnd
breath in an effort to impress you. The
rest of us are trying to conserve
enough energy to breathe.

Q: Do you have to wear uniforms all
the time?

A: Yes all of the time. We even have
uniform pajamas. (No I’ m not making
this up. I’m serious. Mine have ﬂuffy
clouds on them.)

Q: Do you have to go into the military?
A: No. It’s up to the cadet. I’m not.
My roommate is though. He’s into
service to America and killing stuff.
Q: Why did you go there?

A: I was drugged by pirates and
dropped off here on the ﬁrst day.

GR\l’l*ﬂC(I()LIKIBY\XIW\¥/.\"lvl[Hll
Q: Do you like it?
A: Hey, look over there! (Patter of feet
to the nearest exit.)

On the occasion that we do talk
to a W&L person, it usually turns out
badly. 1
Wendy W&L: I-Ii, where do you go to
school.

Cadet Clyde: Uh, a small liberal arts
college in Lexington.

Wendy: Wow, what fraternity are you in?
Clyde: Alpha.

Wendy: Alpha Tau?

Clyde: No, Alpha Riﬂe Company.
Wendy: Oh. (Crosses arms and slowly
backs awat towards the nearest exit
avoiding eye-contact.)

That’s the extreme. It’s not always
that bad. It’s rare though that a W&L
person will hang out with a VNII guy
or gal. But let’s try to change that and
foster a new appreciation for each other
as we move into the 21st century.

Or invite me to a party.

Reach Sam LaGrone at
lagronesr@mail.vmi.edu.
