Movie makers detect at least two computers uploading illegally, request school shut down offending accounts

BY ANDREW LATIMER
NEWS EDITOR

Lexington may be over 2,400 miles from Hollywood,
but it is not far enough away to escape the attention of

raj or motion picture companies.

University Computing said two members of the Washing-
ton and Lee community have been warned about sharing full-
length movies using peer-to-peer programs on the network

Once found out, the illegal distributor and the school
can both face criminal charges, which, under the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act, carry a maximum jail sentence
of ﬁve years and up to $500,000 in ﬁnes.

John White, University Computing HelpDesk man-
ager, stated,“It’s going to be an ongoing issue.” File shar-

ing continues to be a popular use of ‘network resources, yet
students have to be more careful about their actions.

“What we’ve tried to do is create policies for students
who aren’t abusing the system,” said White. For instance,
the university will not cut off a student account unless the
student absolutely refuses to stop uploading illegal files.

Students can be brought up on charges of an Honor
Violation only if they promise to comply with university
policy and continue abusing the network.

Director of University Computing John Stuckey re-
vealed that copyright protection company Mediaforce
scanned and logged the address of two KaZaA users with
copies of Fellowship of the Ring, a Warner Bros. release.

The company then sent e-mails to the school, and it
was up to University Computing to determine the users’

names and issue cease—and-desist letters.

on copyright inﬁingement cases. Past cases included two

ing Simpsons episodes and Disney’s The Lion King.

also sent notices for song swapping.

According to statistics on Mediaforce’s
website, movie piracy costs U.S. movie com-

panies over $3 .6 billion a year.

tions to limit uploads to zero in order to prevent the
possibility of future incidents or litigation.

From the Alumni House to
West Virginia, Washington and
Lee’s most populous student orga-
nization has been on the move re-
cently. The.College Republicans
have been actively involved in lo-
cal politics in the weeks leading up
to Election Day on Nov. 5.

This year, the group is attempt-
ing to strengthen the relationship
between members of the University
and the Republican Party, on both
the local and national level.

Last Monday, College Repub-

A licans attended a Youth Rally on

the steps of W&L’s Alumni House.
The Rally featured Senator John
W. Warner ‘49, U.S. House Repre-
sentative Robert W. Goodlatte ‘77
L, Virginia Delegates Christopher
B. Saxman and H. Morgan Griffith
and Virginia 24th District Delegate
Candidate Ben Cline, who have all
been traveling throughout Virginia
in recent weeks.

Cline is running against Demo-
crat candidate Mimi Elrod, wife of
the late W&L president John
Elrod. A repeat of their recent tele-
vised debate will air on University
Cable Channel 2 tonight and
Wednesday at 7 p.m.

Approximately 20 students
participated in the Rally, which
was declared by College Republi-
cans Executive Director Megan
Zingarelli, ‘O5, to be “very suc-
cessful.” College Republicans
boasts over 600 members on cam-
pus.

TRIUMVIRATE. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, Va. candidate Ben Cline and Sen. John Warner made an appearance at last Monday’s
College Republicans rally. The event, intended to drum up area support for local and state races, was sparsely attended.

dents were given signs declaring
their support and enthusiasm for
the politicians. Students were re-
cruited from the crowd to stand be-
hind the speakers.

Goodlatte was the first to ar-
rive, and so also the first to address
the crowd. Each of the candidates
spoke brieﬂy, choosing instead to
focus their attention on speaking
to the members of the crowd indi-
vidually. All of the political partici-
pants have ties to the University,
and expressed their fond admiration
for the school and its students.

This Saturday, 12 members of .
the College Republicans traveled
to Martinsburg, W. Va., to partici-

pate in the campaign of incumbent
Congresswoman Shelley Moore
Capito. Capito is competing
against Democrat Jim Humphries
in West Virginia’s 2nd District in
what has been declared to be one
of the closest and most competi-
tive congressional races in the
nation.

Student participants carried
signs in support of Capito and
marched in the Annual Apple Har-
vest Festival Parade through
downtown Martinsburg.

“We really made a difference
by getting her name out,” stated
College Republicans President
John Heath, ‘O4.

W&L volunteers were joined
by members of College Republican
groups at the University of Vir-
ginia and James Madison Univer-
sity, as well as local residents.

The College Republicans plan
to continue this increased level of
activity as the year progresses.
Next Saturday, members will be
traveling to southwestern Virginia
in order to participate in a “Youth
Unity Rally” for Jay Katzen, Re-
publican candidate for Congress.

College Republicans will con-
tinue to participate in campaign
workshops and plan to bring speak-
ers to campus within the upcom-
ing months.

AMONG SCHOOL CHILDREN

“Caution” was the operative
word during last Monday’s debate
on Iraq, held at the Virginia Mili-
tary Institute.

The forum featured Gen. An-
thony Zinni, special envoy to the
Middle East, who commanded the
attention of the audience.

Speaking at full-volume to a
ﬁlled Jackson Memorial Hall, Zinni
did not budge from his anti-war
stance as he deemed the stalled
Middle East peace process more im-
perative than taking down Saddam
Hussein. “He’s a bum dictator,”
Zinni quipped.

During the forum’s question
and answer session, he added, “If
we are willing to risk 100,000 troops
in Iraq, why not throw our weight
around where it matters (in the
Middle East)?”

The event, entitled “Casus Belli:
Why we go to war—The United
States and Iraq,” gave new life to an
aheady well-wom topic. Fellow pan-
elist Patrick Lang, a consultant to sev-
eral major news networks, remarked
that‘ the sentiment inside Washing-
ton is that war is inevitable and delib-
eration has been limited.

Lang and Amb. Read Harmer
were the only two speakers frrrnly in
favor of conflict with Iraq. “We’ve
given diplomacy a decade, and it’s
good enough for me,” Hamner said
of a peaceful resolution.

Both called a conﬂict with Iraq
crucial to fighting al—Qaeda, and
Harrmer speculated that Iraqi-built
nuclear devices would eventually ﬁnd
their way into the hands of terrorists.

Brig. Gen. and Dean of the (VMI)
Faculty Charles Brower offered his

thoughts on the type of war the
United States will wage, although he
balked at the projected three-year $275
billion price tag and urged that America
adopt a wait-and—see approach in-
stead of risking a hasty ﬁght.

Asst. Prof of Law at Washing-
ton and Lee Mark Drumbl analyzed
the ramiﬁcations of conﬂict with Iraq
upon international law. He ultimately

. concluded that acting with the in-

tention of a “preemptive strike” will
“lower the bar” for an acceptable war,
leading to increased turmoil and a
world order built upon armed con-
ﬂict. , V

Speakers drew upon lessons
learned from history, as Hamner com-
pared current times to 1939 and the
rise of Hitler. Along with moderator
and assoc. professor of international
studies Lt. Col. James Hentz,
Hamner said post-war actions
should mirror the Marshall Plan that
followed World War H.

The panel entertained ques-
tions from VMI cadets, W&L stu-
dents and Lexington residents for

Fomrer ooeducation opponent makes amends

FROM STAFI" AND WIRE REPORTS

One of Washington and Lee University’s most avid
co-education opponents donated $1 million as scholar-

- ship for female students.
I Jonathan Westervelt (Jack) Warner ’40 said of his gift to
the University, “Maybe I did it to alleviate my sins of the past.”

in his opposition of co-education.

“I just felt we would lose camara-
derie,” he said. “We would lose some-
thing in tenns of choice. By remaining
all male, I though we would be distinc-
tive, different and attractive.”

Wrthhisnew endowment, designated
for females with academic merit, Warner
said he hopes to show he has somewhat
changed his viewsabout co-education.

“I thought if they are going to have the ladies there,
we might as well have smart ones,” Warner said.

Warner said he designated the scholarship money
for women at the last minute and its label came as a sur-
prise to many members of the W&L community.

A new program has matched tutors with
more than 30 students needing academic
assistance.

The Peer Tutoring Program, operated out of

' the Dean of Freshman’s Office, pairs

upperclassmen tutors with “students who may
be struggling, to assess where those struggles
are,” said Freshmen Dean Dawn Watkins.

Students volunteer for assistance, or are
referred by donn counselors or professors.

“I refer at least one or two students per week
throughout most of the term,” Associate Dean
of the College Jeanine Stewart said.

Stewart helps trains tutors and reminds faculty
about the prograrn’s availability. The Dean of the
College’s Ofﬁce payed for the training materials.

However, “Watkins has taken the lead in
developing this program,” Stewart said. After
arriving at W&L two surrnners ago, Watkins found
no comprehensive peer tutoring program existed.

“Mid—way through the fall, I met with
(Stewart) and proposed the idea of a tutoring
program that was centralized through my
office,” Watkins said. With her work, the
program began last Winter. term.

“Last year was the year we got this off the
ground, this year is the year that we are trying
to ﬁnely tune it,” Watkins said.

Watkins currently coordinates the peer tutors
for her Ofﬁce, designing handbooks, maintaining
and monitoring the program and assessing results. .

Assistant Head Dormitory Counselors Dan
Tortora and Lincoln Rose assist her, overseeing the
tutor’s database and assigning them to students.

“About 30 students are being tutored, and
we expect that number to rise signiﬁcantly due
to midterm grades,” Tortora said. “The majority
of students being tutored are freshmen,
probably because the program is part of the
Freshman program, but the Peer Tutoring
Program is not at all limited to freshmen.”

Foreign language, math, and biology tutors
are in high demand, Tortora said.

Potential tutors were sent applications
over the summer.

“Upperclass students, usually recommended by
theirprofemors, appliedtobetutors,”Tortorasaid “Each
department approved orrejectedthose applications and
classes the applicants wislbd to 

“All tutors are nominated by members of their
major department, or another department where the
student has done a substantial amount of high
caliber work,” Stewart said. “This resource
supplements others, like working with the professor
during ofﬁce hours, or meeting with a study group.”

Tutors, who are unpaid, work with students
from 60 to 90 minutes a week. Last week, they
attended an hour-long training. Watkins and
Stewart, who presented, deliniated the goals and
limits of tutoring, presented scenarios and

explained the availability of professional ,

resources. ,
Tutors were given a handbook containing a

Study Skills diagnostic, which was keyed to sections

related to etfective study and time management

BFA announces its new name,
plans for Lexington-area food drive

The ﬁve chairs of the Black Female Alliance
voted last week to change the organization’s title
to the Human Rights Alliance as an effort to make
students “more comfortable” about joining.

“Our name gave the campus an excuse to reject
us. Now they’ll have to judge us on our objectives
only,” saidj unior chair Marinda Harrell. The HRA will
continue to work for diversity and unity on campus.

Several students and faculty members com-
plained that the former name implied exclusivity,
although members pointed out that since day one
“anyone could join.”

The first item on the HRA’s agenda is the kick-
off for their 3,000-bag community-wide food drive,

Top 10 reasons to enjoy
this stressful academic season

For some reason, this week more than
other has garnered an extraordinary (and pos-
sibly undue?) amount of stress, speciﬁcally in
the lives of my friends that engage in studies
of the C—School persuasion. Perhaps it’s the
fault of n1id—terms? Or was it the B-law lecture?
At any rate, the level of high—spirited “look—at—
me—I’m-in-college” gusto has declined dramati-

the Virginia lottery two days ago and only won
$5. And if you get all ﬁve numbers right, you get
$100,000, which, granted, is nothing to sneeze
at, but not quite the reward one would imagine
for randomly selecting ﬁve matching numbers.

edly not paying a parking ticket, when it had
been paid in May.

W&L lacks dating scene

Writers from the Phi often write
about W&L’s dating scene, or lack
thereof. After some background research,
I found two broad themes echoed by
most people I interviewed: the ﬁrst was
dislike of the opposite
sex and the second was
recognition of the preva-
lent hooking-up scene.

“The guys/girls
here suck!” I have
heard this phrase more at W&L than
anywhere else. Perhaps people say
it out of frustration, perhaps out of
despair, or perhaps because they
haven’t found the right person for
them. But, it is statistically impossible
for all of the guys or girls here to be
terrible. There is no shortage of de-
cent single people on campus. I think
that this phrase reﬂects more on our
severely fragmented student body.

Students should ask themselves the
question: “How many people have I
honestly tried to meet this week . ” Ifyou
are not a freshman, your answer will prob-
ably be pretty low. After freshman year,
W&L students tend to establish social
circles with staying power.

It seems that dating pools (and
friendships, which are more important
anyway) would expand if students
would more readily venture outside of

ONATHAN WORTHAM

Also, it is clear that W&L is on the
hooking-up system. Hooking up, rather
than dating, is acommon way of ﬁnding
that special someone. Obviously, both
systems have beneﬁts and drawbacks.

But, in my conversa-
tions, I didn’t ﬁnd any
girls who didn’t want
<04 to go on dates—or
guys for that matter.
Use this infor-
mation to your advantage! If the
people I talked to are telling the truth,
why is the hooking up system so
much more popular than the dating
one? Perhaps it is convenience, per-
haps students have too much aca-
demic work to go on dates, but, most
likely, people are apprehensive about
asking each other out.

Datefunctions manifestthisapprehen—
sion I’mnot sure why W&Lhas somany
date functions (we should cut back to one
peryear,Ithink),butitseernsthatthenum-
berofpeopletakingadateisonthedecline.
When date functions come up, everyone
hasheardsomeonesay:“I’mnotgoingwith
anyone. I’m just going to get drunk”

Now, if we use what we’ve gotten
from the first two paragraphs of this ar-
ticle, it should be easy to ﬁnd a good date
and have more fun at date functions.
Christmas Weekend fast approaches:
make sure you do something about it.

.W&L unbeaten streak reaches 14

Generals sandwich 2-goa/ wins over Eastern Mennonite, Chowan around 1-1 road tie to Bridgewater

BY JEREMY FRANKLIN
SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee

._ women’s soccer team pushed its un-

beaten streak to 14 games with home
wins against Eastern Mennonite and
Chowan and a road tie against
Bridgewater this week.

Sophomore Molly Plummer had
two goals and an assist as the Gener-
als (11-1-3) knocked off Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference foe Eastern
Mennonite 3-1 at the Liberty Hall
Fields on Thursday.

Plummer scored her first goal at
34211 of the first half on a shot from 18
yards out. She assisted freshman
Kerry Giblin’s tally with just over two
minutes remaining before halftime.

The Royals made a brief charge
to begin the second half, and Audra

i Baker sliced the lead in half when she

beat W&L sophomore goalie Abigail
Pfeffer less than ﬁve minutes after
halftime.

But Plummer and the Generals
responded, and the sophomore for-
ward notched her second goal of the
afternoon at 59:55.

On defense, W&L contained Roy-
als forward Ellie Lind, who entered the
match with 14 goals in 11 games. Pfeffer
made two saves to earn the victory.

“It was probably defensively the
best game we’ve played all year,”
W&L coach Neil Cunningham said.
“The first half we played particularly

, well. That was our best team perfor-

-4.

 

mance all year, without doubt.”

INSTANT OFFENSE. Sophomore forward Molly Plummer (9) scored once in W&L’s
2-1 win over Chowan at the Liberty Hall Fields on Sunday. In three games this
week, Plurrirner ﬁnished with four goals and an assist.

W&L had a nine-match win
streak snapped at Bridgewater on Sat-
urday, as the Eagles battled the Gen-
erals to a 1-1 tie.

Plummer tallied a ﬁrst—half goal for
W&L, which concluded the ODAC regu-
lar season with an 8- 1-2 record.
Bridgewater tied the contest 2:26 into
the second half on a Sandy Lagana goal.

The Generals had plenty of
chances to break the 1- 1 deadlock, but
they couldn’t beat Bridgewater keeper
Julianne Blevins, who recorded eight

saves. Sophomore Emily Barker
played all 1 10 minutes in net for W&L,
making one save on the afternoon.
Cunningham was disappointed with
his team’s effort, which may have cost
the Generals a regular—season ODAC title.
“We didn’t play as well as we
should, and we didn’t deserve to win
on the basis of that,” he said. “Every
game is important, and we just got a
little ahead of ourselves, thinking
about (the ODAC Tournament) next
week before we even played today.”

W&L bounced back from the
Bridgewater tie less than 24 hours later
with a 2-0 win over Chowan College
at home on Sunday.

Plummer again found the net in
the first half for the Generals, de-
flecting a pass from Giblin off
Braves goalie Emily Wartham and
into the net.

“She’s doing a great job. She’s in
the right place to ﬁnish a chance that
we’re creating,” Cunningham said of
Plummer. “She’s been pretty impor-
tant, the last week especially.”

The home team extended its lead
to 2-0 with 17:21 remaining before half-
time when sophomore Maggie Hope
scored off an assist from junior
Fontaine Marcoux.

The Generals’ coach noticed the
effect on his team of playing three
times in four days in the second half.

“We were a little tired, and three
games in four days deﬁnitely showed
today,” Cunningham said. “Luckily,
we got the two goals early on, but we
looked really tired in the second half.”

W&L has until Saturday to re-
group, as the Generals host Savan-
nah Art & Design and Goucher on
Saturday and Sunday of Parents’
Weekend. Though both games are
non—conference, Cunningham be-
lieves that it’s important for his team
to head into the ODAC Tournament
Nov. 2 with a couple of wins.

“They’re real big because they’re
not ODAC games, but we’ve got two
games to get ready and get prepared,”
he said. “We need to win both.”

MONDAY, ULTOBER 11, zuuz

BY DAVID CROWELL
.\SSlST.\NT SPORTS EDITOR

Despite a furious charge by the
Washington and Lee men’s soccer
team, Catholic’s combination of
Cameron Bassiri and Keith Cappo
proved too much as the Cardinals
topped the Generals 4-3 on Saturday
afternoon.

Bassiri tallied a hat trick, scoring
the first three Catholic goals, and
Cappo scored the game-winner with
11:57 to play, overcoming a tremen-
dous day by sophomore midfielder
Brian Pirkle, who scored two goals and
set up a third W&L score by drawing
a foul in Catholic’s zone.

Bassiri started the scoring at the
9:29 mark after beating two defenders
down the left side and drilling a shot
into the top right comer past senior
goalie Tim Foley.

The Generals (5-7-2), however,
wasted little time in evening the score,
as Pirkle scored his first goal less than
two rriinutes later. Following a jumble
in front of Catholic’s net, W&L’s lead-
ing scorer headed the ball in off an
assist by senior forward Brad
Murphy.

“The ball was really jumping
around in front and it was just bad
defense on their part,” said Pirkle,
who now has seven goals on the year.

The score remained tied at 1-1 for
the next 15 minutes despite some
good scoring opportunities for W&L.

I CARDINALS WIN. Senior midfielder Garreth Winstead prepares for a throw-in during

Washington and Lee’s 4-3 non-conference home loss to Catholic on Saturday.

Bassiri ended the deadlock after
some miscommunication by W&L’s de-
fense, taking a deﬂection off sophomore
defender Peter Miller and easily putting
the ball past Foley. The Cardinals took

that 2-1 lead into halftime, but Bassiri

extended the lead with 18:22 to play.
W&L proved they still had some

life, however, as Pirkle made a run to-

wards the goal, only to be tripped by

cer, 4-3

Catholic’s goalie, Todd Magin. The
foul, hotly contested by the Cardinals,
gave the Generals a penalty kick,
which junior midﬁelder Jacob Stoehr
easily hit, pulling W&L to within one.

“It felt good. We were talking about
who should take it and I had been the
man who drew the foul, but Jacob really
needed one to help his conﬁdence, and
I was glad he hit it,” Pirkle said.

The goal was the first of the year
for Stoehr, who tallied nine goals last
season.

Cappo scored the game-winner
just over two minutes later, but W&L
provided some drama in the closing
seconds, as Pirkle scored with 46 sec-
onds left.

“We obviously want to score
every goal we can. It’s a matter of re-
spect and we should be putting them
in at every part of the game,” he said.
“I think that’s indicative of our team.
We’re always going to go hard.”

A hard-fought match resulted in a
0-0 tie on Thursday afternoon as cross-
town rivals W&L and VMI faced off at
the Keydets’ Patchin Field.

VMI held a 13-6 advantage in
shots and a 15-5 advantage in comer
kicks, but couldn’t get anything past
Foley, who made seven saves.

VM1’s Brian Douglas turned back
six shots in goal for the Keydets.

The Generals return to Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference action when
they travel to Eastern Mennonite for a
4 p.m. match on Wednesday.

The Washington and Lee field
hockey team improved to 7-7 on the
year with shutout home wins over
Sweet Briar and Rhodes this week.

W&L improved to 5-3 in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference by de-
feating Sweet Briar 6-0 on Tuesday.

The Generals quickly established
their dominance, leading 2-0 at half-
time thanks to goals by freshman
midﬁelder S.B. Northen and junior
sweeper Maitena Moure.

Despite a turn for the worse in
the weather, W&L persevered and
continued to rack up goals. They
scored four more times before the
game ended with goals by sophomore
forward Ali Santoro, sophomore de-
fender Erin Rathbone, freshman
midﬁelder Jane Beall and Northen.

In addition, the team dominated
in shots and penalty comers (27—2 and
9-1 respectively), and the Generals
also commanded possession.

“We really played as a team,
which is something we struggled with
in our loss to Juniata (on Oct. 12),”
head coach Wendy Orrison said. “We
also displayed a lot of skill and
athleticism, which is essential to good

ball control on turf and in inclement
conditions.”

Moure, Rathbone, Santoro and
sophomores Kristen Brown and Kitt
Murphy all illustrated such teamwork by
recording assists for the Generals; Brown
ﬁnished with two. Freshman goaltender
Courtney Harrison played the entire game
in net to record the shutout.

Sunday’s ﬁeld hockey action saw
the Generals at work at home again, host-
ing Rhodes College. In a spectacular
blowout, W&L defeated the Lynx 5-0.

Five different Generals scored
during the game. Murphy broke the
ice with an unassisted goal with 27:40
remaining in the ﬁrst half. Moure added
the Generals’ second goal of the half,
also unassisted, with 15: 17 remaining.

The second half saw more bal-
anced offensive action. Northen
scored off an assist from Murphy.
Rathbone scored on a penalty circle,
assisted by Moure, and exchange stu-
dent Joanna Slack assisted junior for-
ward Kelly Taffe to round out the game.

Freshman goalies Courtney
Harrison and Elise Gelinas split time in
net for W&L, combining for one save,
while Rhodes freshman Alice Cowley
earned 11 saves during the game.

W&L travels to Rando1ph-Ma-
con for a 4:30 p.m. match Thursday.

BY BARRETT DAWS
SPORTS WRITER

Washington and Lee football
suffered a 44-13 loss to the
Hampden-Sydney Tigers at Wilson
Field on Saturday.

The problems for the Generals
(2-4, 2-2 Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference) started with the second
play, as Hampden-Sydney running
back C.W. Clemmons rushed for a
67-yard touchdown run to put the
Tigers ahead 6-0.

Hampden-Sydney (5-1, 3- 1)
would score twice more in the first
half for a 21-0 lead, and then scored
two more touchdowns and hit a ﬁeld
goal in the third to take a 38-0 ad-
vantage into the fourth quarter.

The Generals’ offense came
alive in the fourth quarter as junior
quarterback Sean McGarvey found
senior tight end Jay Thomas for two
touchdown receptions, one of 10
yards and the other 30.

Unfortunately for the Generals,
the game clock expired before the
offense could finish making its
charge. The Tigers also scored once
in the fourth quarter, making the 44-
13 ﬁnal.

Clemmons led the Hampden-
Sydney, rushing 11 times for 116
