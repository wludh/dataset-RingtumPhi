“To promote literature in this rising
empire and to encourage the arts
have ever been amongst the warmest
wishes of my heart.”

George Washington

Law senior Phil Thompson was
presented two of Washington and
Lee’s most prestigious awards—The
Gilliam Award, and The Ring-tum
Phi Award—at Thursday’s Senior
Banquet. Also receiving Ring-tum
Phi Awards for service were Dean
William W. Pusey and I-Hsiung Ju.

Thompson was Vice President of
the student body this year as well as
head dormitory counselor. He also
attended W&L as an undergraduate
and was a football captain.

Phe Frank J. Gilliam Award is
presented annually to that student
who has made the most valuable
contribution to student affairs in one
or more fields. The award is named
for Dean Emeritus Frank J. Gilliam
as a tribute to his long and devoted
service to Washington and Lee.

President R.E.R. Huntley made
the presentation of the award, In
accepting this honor Thompson ex-
ipressed his gratitude and revealed
he was very thrilled because Dean
Gilliam was the first person he had
met at W&L. Phil also mentioned
his deep respect and love for Dean

Gilliam who attended the ceremony.

The Ring-tum Phi Awards are
presented annually to members of
the University administration, fac-
ulty, staff, or student body who
have rendered outstanding service to
any phase of life at Washington and
Lee.

The citation for Dean Pusey stat-
ed, “It is not often that a university
—whether it be large or small—finds
itself blessed with an administrative
leader who is wholly dedicated to
the service of that institution. Wash-
ington and Lee has been blessed
with such a man. He teaches. He
administrates. But most of all, he
has given himself to W&L as a
teacher, Dean of the College, and
even as Acting President of the
University.”

Phil Thompson received the stu-
dent Ring-tum Phi Award. His cita-
tion read: “Not long ago a student
remarked to us that it was odd that
this recipient worked so hard in stu-
dent government when he ‘got noth-
ing out of it.’ We feel sure that if the
student had made the same remark

to our next recipient, he would have
laughed in his face. This man has
worked for the betterment of the
student government at Washington
and Lee ever since he entered this
university as a freshman. And if we
had to name his contribution to stu-
dent life and to the University as a

whole, we would have to put it in

one word: wisdom.”

I-Hsiung Ju received the final
Ring-tum Phi Award for service. In
awarding the plaque Editor-elect
John Robinson made this statement:
“This individual has not been at
Washington and Lee for any great
length of time. He is an artist whose
work at Washington and Lee has
given this university great and much-
needed recognition in the field of the
arts. But more importantly, this in-
dividual’s presence at this institution
has encouraged a new interest in the
arts among students. For his re-
strained exwherance in teaching and
his work for the cultural betterment
of this community as the artist-in-
residence, we present this Ring-tum
Phi Award to I-Hsiung Ju.”

Munsick, Paukert Selected As
Contact Symposium Chairmen

Roger Munsick of Summit, New
Jersey, and Skip Paukert of Atlanta
will serve as co-chairmen of next
year’s Contact symposium at Wash-
ington and Lee.

The two were elected last week by
joint Executive Committee-Interfra-
ternity Council selection committee.

Unlike past Contact presentations,
which attempted to center on a
specific theme, next year’s sympos-
ium is expected to be based largely
on a diverse discussions, with a wide
range of visiting speakers dealing
with their own fields of interest.
“Having worked on Contact °71”,
Paukert explained, “we have come
to realize that an in depth coverage
of nearly any given theme is impos-
sible within such a limited space of
time.”

“We really think that the majority
of the student body has become tired
of the highly political nature of

many of the speakers who have tak-
en part in the theme-oriented pro-
grams of the past few years. While
we may well sponsor some politi-
cians, men who will provide new or

Prof. Lewis Cite of Hollins and Dr, I-Heieng Ju display works from the

unusual perspectives on their topics,
we felt a concerted effort should be
made to include not only speakers
from varied fields, but also different
styles of presentation, such as per-
haps films, and exhibits,” Munsick
added.

“Our theme right now,” Paukert
continued,” is really just contact,
contact with a variety of human
problems and contact with issues
confronting our own university. We
hope very much to present seminars

headed by W&L faculty members.”

Munsick, a rising senior history
major is currently Managing Editor
of The Ring-tum Phi, and served as
vice chairman of Contact ‘71 which
spotlighted “The Crisis in Higher
Education.” Paukert, who double
majors in English and European
history, is News Editor of The Ring-
tum Phi and was a member of the
Steering Committee of this year's
symposium.

their division of the tourney, ac-
cumulating a 4 and 2 record.

Simultaneously, W&L co-captains
Bob Bruyere of Houston and Andy

NYU contest was the strong forensic

The New York University tourna-
ment, one of the most respected of
the annual national debate meets,
brought to a close a winning season
for the WAL debaters, who—though
nearly all underclassmen—brought
home three trophies and several
commendations as best team orf
speaker. “We were able to partici-
pate in some 15 tournaments from
Florida to New York,” said co<ap
tain Bruyere, “and, all in all, we
were quite pleased with the results.”

In addition to the four who tra
velled to NYU, active members of
the WAL team inchide: junior Cal

questions in the affirmative then
your education at WAL is badly

be solved by taking one of the most
unique courses offered at WAL dur-
ing the Spring Term—Frencoh 201

This French “total immersion”
course is being tried for the first
time this semester and is quite differ

REVIEW and OUTLOOK 'T'roubs Produce Russian Work

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

May 19,1971

Re: W&L Lacrosse
A Word of Praise...

National athletic reergnition has evaded Washington and
Lee for quite a few years. Some have grumbled that an un-

subsidized program would result in only mediocre showings

against athletic machines pumped full of cash and scholarships.
Some people over in Doremus Gymnasium did not acquiesce

to this verdict. A case in point is Coach Dick Szlasa and his

lacrosse squad. They have brought a division championship to

W&L,

In lacrosse matches the Generals went 11-2. The losses were
to top ranked Virginia and third ranked Navy. By any standard
that is quite an accomplishment. But when you consider that
W&L was a contender for a berth in the national post-season
tournament, it is quite an accomplishment indeed.

The eight teams finally selected for the tournament in-
cluded: Navy, Army, Air Force, Maryland, Virginia, Hofstra,
Cornell and Brown. Each of these schools is at least two times

as large as Washington and Lee. Being compared with schools

of this size is a remarkable showing.

\ division championship, a 11-2 record and national rank-

ing overcome the disappointment of not being invited to the

national tournament.

Coach

Szlasa and

the team should be

heartily commended! They have proven that W&L can com-

pete with anybody regardless of size or financial subsidization.

Word of Criticism...

\ large contingent of Washington and Lee men made the
trek over to Charlottesville last Wednesday to see the Univer-
sity of Virginia lacrosse match, Well over 300 students braved
the downpour to cheer for the Generals, So many W&L folks
were there at the outset of the game, that Wahoos arriving late
thought our side of the field was the U.Va. section.

In stark contrast to this genuine outpouring of school spirit

stood the activities of a few students. Gentlemanly conduct was

not exactly the order of the day. A steady barrage of beer cans

were tossed on the field. The officials and even players stopped

on several oceasions to remove these cans and other thrown

objects from the playing surface.

These actions resulted in a discredit to W&L and its tradi-

tions of gentlemanly conduct. A more important result may be

an adverse effect on W&L lacrosse recruiting. We doubt if any

lacrosse prospects would be overly impressed by this display.

It is hard enough to recruit high quality players without athletic

scholarships. There is no need to let the misconduct of a few

complicate the difficulty of the task of recruitment.

Word of Thanks...

If you were listening to the radio last week you might have

heard an unusual advertisement. The announcer told of taking a

bus over to Charlottesville for the U.Va. lacrosse game. The

radio spot and trip were initiated by Mr, Gerald Darrell, who

runs the Compons.
\RA Slate

funded by

The advertisements and bus charter were

Food Services.

Ouite a few underclassmen wanted to see the game but had

no means of transportation. Darrell saw the problem, and being

an ardent supporter of W&L athletics, he provided a solution

It is

Letters To The Editor

RING-TUM PHI
LETTER POLICY

The Ring-tum Phi encourages let-
ters to the editor. Letters must be
typed and signed. In order to appear
in Wednesday's edition letters must
be submitted by 6:00 p.m. Monday
to The Ring-tum Phi office in Reid
Hall. Letters to the editor are sub-
ject to editing for length, grammar
and libel.

Hinely Replies
Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

For the enlightenment of Mr.
Woodley and anyone whose “other-
wise quite reasonable” mind read
and believed what he said in his
letter of last week, | must say that
1 did NOT equate the Soviet gov-
ernment with the Roman Catholic
Church. I merely drew a PARAL-
LEL, which I still hold as valid, and
which is quite different in nature
from an overall “equation.” | would
refule the statement that the
Soviet government is the “vilest and
most obscene regime ever to crush
the humanity from a whole people.”
| would cite instead as the winner of
this dubious distinction an arm of
the Roman Catholic Church which
existed during the Middle Ages and
nio the Renaissance which was
known as the Inquisition, At least
the Soviets do not use the false pre
tense of being on the side of God in
their brutal secret police activitives
In the USSR, the defendant-victim
is only accused of crimes against the
state and thus the people rather than
crimes against the Church and thus
supposediy against God. The Soviets
do not find it necessary to cower be
hind a cloak of holiness to get rid
of those whom they do not like
They do not prevert religion to their
own ends; they merely suppress it in
general

in the audience:

Personal wealth becomes

Last but not least, let me refer the

that Utopia is based on selflessness,

Track Coverage

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

As a member of the WAL track

the manner in which you reported
the results of the CAC track meet
It is true that we were a disgusting
last, but you are ignoring some very
fine performances. You made the
statement in your article, “Mike
Carrere gave WAL its best showing
in track with a third in the javelin.”
But what about Bob Sherwood's
third in the mile and Steve Haugh
ney’s third in the 880

Believe it or not, the track team
is still alive and is trying. It may be
very strong in about two years. For
instance, we have recruited or have

Members of the “Total Theatre”
class have worked this short term to
construct a room using the stage
floor and platforms over the audi-
torium to create the environment in
which the play’s action occurs. The
audience will witness “The Lower
Depths” within those surroundings
as well, lending a greater immediacy
and realism to their final production
of the season.

Seating for the audience is limit-
ed, however, and reservations for
the play should be made well in ad-
vance of its May 21-28 perform-
ances.

The action of “The Lower Depths”
takes place in the basement of a
lodging house in Russia at the turn
of the century. Inhabitants of the
house are of the class of people in
Russia known as “bosyak,” or “bare-

of society who worked at part-time
jobs or stole in order to live. These

rhe recent ruling by the Justice
Department on the invalidity of Vir-
ginia’s Assembly and House of Rep-
resentatives redistricting plans raises
a plenitude of questions, What right
does the Federal government have
to so blatantly interfere in a state
matter? Why should the American
people tolerate this gross violation
of separation of powers? What—if
any—benefits are to be accrued by
such an unusual structure?

The excuse given for the Voting
Rights Act of 1965 is simple: eleven
southern states have allowed discri-
minatory policies to be used in dis-
tricting plans in the past, and these
states can no longer be trusted to
develop racially unbalanced plans
without Federal supervision. Yet,

an idea is due to the inherent am-
biguity of the means by which it is
expressed—words. For what defini-
tion is not experience dependent and
in fact, basis for essay.

Perhaps lack of speed in some is
due to lack of relatable experience
or is concomitant with increased
perception. Is not speed a virtue of
our supersonic culture? If it is, then
the reasons for its association with
intelligence may be undestandable,
but are they justifiable?

] am not aware of research on the
subject, but it has been my experi-
ence that there are people who are
slowly brilliant who because of the
nature of the testing system which
assumes speed to be a manifestation
of intelligence, are not duly credited.

of society in Russia.

In the basement are the whores,
drunkards, fallen aristocracy, thieves,
foreigners, tramps and _ diseased
which form the classes of Gorky’s
permanently closed society. The ac-
tion in the play moves much like a
musical composition, having a four-
act structure similar to a symphony’s
four movements. There are outbursts
of anger, moments of silence and
brief moments of song and laughter.

But it is the strikingly different
characters which make “The Lower
Depths” come alive in its environ-
mental surroundings. Their struggles
in this closed environment provide
at once a “slice of life” in Tzarist
Russia and a living conflict between
two philosophies of life in that base-
ment.

and supporting rebel party factions
subservient to the national organi-
zation. However, now that the Exe-
cutive has switched hands, the poli-
tical pragmatism of yesteryear disap-
pears, and we see a Republican At-
torney General vetoing a plan which
gerrymandered districts to the detri-
ment of the growing Republican
Party in Virginia. There can be no
excuse for the Congress to so sanc-
timoniously justify political pragma-
tism with moral arguments, yet hu-
man nature being what it is, we can
expect no better.

Fhe American people have be-
come tremendously concerned in the
past ten years with Civil Rights,
yet it is a concern that manifests
itself more by discriminatory acts
than by positive and constructive ac
tion. Instead of requiring all states
—and there is beyond question a
great measure of de facto segrega-
tion in all states—to register dis-
iricting plans with the Justice De
partment and to thus make more
palatable a stillameonstitutional ac-
tion, the Congress has passed legisla-
tion with wide popular approval
which makes a scape-goat out of one
section of the country and attempts
to foster on them the blame for all
racial discrimination.

It is undeniable that the South
has been a land of bigotry and sup
pression of blacks. However, such

shame W&L can’t erase the last

consolation for Coach Joe Lyles

that the Generals lose only one

do nothing wrong as they ravished
the slow Blue Devils defense with a
consistent dominance of face-offs
and turnovers. The clumsy Duke at-
tackmen relinquished many of their
goal opportunities on turnovers
caused by excellent checking from
Bill Brumback, John Rogers, and
Ed Tognetti. Freshman Ted Bauer
initiated the Blue Devil freshman
goalie by scoring an unassisted goal
with 13:07 remaining in the first
quarter. Bob Brumback and Hank
Slauson added unassisted goals dur-
ing the period to give the Generals a
3-0 lead.

A cold drizzle began to fall at the
second quarter opening but the Gen-
eral stickmen remained hot. Fresh-
man Skip Lichtfuss, who displayed
some excellent attack maneuvers
scored unassisted at 13:17. Only 16
seconds later, Hank Slauson scored
on an assist by Lichtfuss.

The then 5-0 lead seemed an adequ-
ate cushion to win, But goals by
Slauson, Whit Morrill, “Piggy” Mec-
Cane, and two by Chip Tompkins
vaulted the score to 10-0 at the half.

The wet field slowed the action in
the third quarter. “Piggy” McCane
notched his second goal at 9:29 on
an assist by Scott Neese. Neese turn-
ed around three minutes later and
converted on an assist by Lichtfuss
to give the Generals a 12-0 lead.

Almost 30 seconds after Sam En-
glehart scored, Duke tallied their
first goal on a freak ricochet off two
WAL defensemen to end the quarter
at a lopsided 13-1.

Englehart scored his second goal
with 13:16 left in the fourth quarter
on an assist by Slauson. The Blue
Devils mustered a steady attack at
the W&L goal for several minutes
and converted their final goal at
8:18. Englehart’s third goal, on an
assist by Bauer, and Rick Stieff’s
goal in the last two minutes ended
the scoring at 16-2.

Letters
To the Editor

On Intelligence

(Continued from page 2)

An expression of one man’s
thoughts have meaning to another
person only in the context of his
perception of them, feebly transmut-
ed through the medium of language.
Because expression does not have
existence beyond the expression ex-
cept within the sum of the recipient's
mind, whatever that may be, it seems
unlikely that speed of comprehen-
sion necessarily is an indication of
the recipient’s understanding of the
expression,

Clearly, this is not true in all
cases, but there must be some minds,
which due to nonsimilarity of experi-
ence with the exponent of an idea,
cultural biases, vocabulary gaps or a
precondition to perceive many par-
tial aspects of an idea before the
total idea is “comprehended,” are
tagged slower, but are not less in-
telligently responding. Because this
assumption, that speed is an index of
intelligence is so prevalent in our
system of student evaluation, yet

may be a false one, it should be’

questioned.
Warner Hudson, °71

Spyglass:
Voti ight
oting Rights
(Continued from page 2)
open and above-board violation of
traditional states rights will be in
the long run benefit no one, and,
while it might cause a quite minor
increase in voting rights among
those eleven states, it will also foster
such sectionalism and racial bitter-
ness as we shall not in our time see
ended. It is another case of the
short-term gain accepted over the
long-term, and of utopian plans on a
grandiose scale which do no more
than bring an increase in the prob-
lem they were intended to end.
There is a measure of hypocrisy
in all this: the South, with a tradi-
tion of unconstitutional yet de jure
segregation, penalized and forced to
submit to the supervision of the
Federal government, while the
North, with its tradition of covert
and de facto segregation, is allowed
to continue its policies. Why should
the South be penalized for its hon-
esty? There are many things the
Federal government can do to in-
crease Civil Rights, but not—for the
sake of our Constitution—should it
adopt the Marxist view of the means
being more inyportant than the end!

The game will be played at Tufts

last year, when the South won a
thriller, 11-10, before a crowd of

Bruce Corrie of Duke will be the
head coach for the South, assisted
by Szlasa and Ferris Thomsen of
Denison. The North coaches are
Jerry Schmidt of Hobart, assisted by
Renzie Lamb of Williams and Paul
Hartman of Plymouth State.

Fifty-two college seniors, 26 on
each team, will be chosen later to
play in the game. The South leads
in the series, 16-11, with one tie.

the season’s outstanding team was re-

ceived by Bruyere and Bradshaw.

In November the W&L debaters
hosted the district tournament, one
of the ten five-state teams that com-
prise the intercollegiate forensic lea-
gue. Arguing versus the top teams of
colleges from Virginia, Maryland,
Delaware, West Vinginia, Pennsyl-
vania, and the District of Columbia,
the W&L debaters were able to cap-
ture the top honors.

“We plan to participate in more
tournaments next year,” remarked
Bradshaw. “We had eight pretty ac-
tive and enthusiastic debaters on
hand this year, but the size of the
group restricted our participation.”
Bradshaw said that a concerted ef-
fort at freshman recruitment would
be resumed this summer with letters
and information sent to interested
members of the incoming class.

“Our purpose is to encourage de-
bating,” agreed the co-captains.
“We've got a strong, young team,
and we can only have confidence
that next year will be an even better
one for us,”

Civic Group Views Problems
Of Community Ties

(Continued from page 1)
Glenn Azuma, vice-president elect
of the Student Body.

The purpose of the meeting was to
open new lines of discussion between
student and civic leaders. Specific
complaints explored in this first
meeting included the recent contro-
versy concerning taxes on the W&L
student body in the form of license
tags and parking meters, and a
feeling among Lexington residents
that students act as if they were “at
the beach” when they are downtown.

Both groups of representatives
agreed that The Ring-tum Phi has

chairs) is the assortment of games
found there. Students may indulge in
“Monopoly,” “Scrabble,” “Milles
Bornes,” and other games—with in-
structions, game ‘boards, playing
cards, and all conversation § in
French,

In order to receive the French
point of view on topics disoussed in
“expression orale” and the “Confer-
ence de Presse,” as well as to help
the students with their pronunciation
and intonation, most of the classes
are attended by Francois Bloc. M.
Bloc is a “Parisien” and is presently
assisting Dr. Brockman to produce
a textbook on French culture and
civilization. He is extremely inter-
esting to listen to; his views are ex-
ceptionally knowledgable with re-
spect to past and current interna-
tional affairs, with a strong leaning
in the direction of French infallibil-
ity.

If one is able to overcome the
frustration of trying to communi-

 

 

caused a great deal of confusion
among both students and city resi-
dents by inacourate reporting. A
plan by fraternities at the beginning
of the year to consolidate their food
buying was effectively scuttled when
Ring-tum Phi coverage hinted that
the fraternities were out to bovcott
certain Lexington merchants. Since
The Ring-tum Phi is the only source
of city news for students as well as
the only student news for city resi-
dents, it was felt that a lack of ac-
curate reporting on its part could
cause nothing but ill will between
the two segments of the community.

Cold check problems were also
discussed at the meeting, and it was
noted that this year’s bad ohecks
have already surpassed $1600, com-
pared with slightly more than $600
for all of last year. The increase,
agreed the representatives, has caus-
ed growing distrust of students
among local merchants. Both groups
said that students should realize that
merchants were doing them a service
by accepting their checks. It was
also noted that the 1970 Virginia
General Assembly passed a law
making the passage of bad checks
for amounts less than $100 a mis-
demeanor, and so students could be
prosecuted, instead of merely fined
by the Cold Check Committee.

The meetings will be continued
throughout the next school year in
hopes of creating a forum where
student and community complaints
can be aired before they develop
into major disputes,
