Cast For “Billy Budd”
Announced This Week
By Troubadour T heater

BY JED YONGE

“Theater.” a word whose defini-
tion lies on a spectrum extending
from the libertine land of Bourbon
Street, its Super Skin and monoton-
ous monologue “48 triple E, come
and see”, to the ultra-real world of
social injustice portrayed most em-
phatically by the actors of the “gue-
rrila theater”; from the melodrama
of the Lux Liquid and other “soaps”
(for which the authors should have
their mouths washed out with their
own product for creating such poor
dialogue) to the Shakespearean
theater of Stratford, Connecticut. (1
must apologize to all you drama
buffs for the dramatic simplification
of the spectrum.)

Somewhere on the above spectrum
lies the adaption of Melville’s “Billy
Budd.” With the exception of an
ironic wrench (“twist” can not con-
vey the amount of irony in the play),
the play is a vehicle to express the
tenor of life’s lifeless battle between
good and evil. It is the very tripe
theme of battle that dictates good
casting, workable set construction
and a clear portrayal in a “do or die”
manner,

Among other firsts—one being
that director Mrs. Ellen Barnes 1s
Washington and Lee’s unique (used
here in the mathematical sense), non-
masculine (*non-masculine” because
1 feel that “feminine” has no con-
notative meaning on this campus)
professor—is the use of the raked
stage. This type of design is meant
to add to the realism of the play
Curiously, however, the attempt to
effect a certain realism will be offset
by the fact that the audience will be
allowed to view the players on and
off the set. The idea being that you,
the audience, are to realize that you
are in a theater and not spying upon
the drama occurring on a British fri

Moger Films Documentary Interview

BY SKIP PAUKERT

The Colonnade served as the back-
drop last Tuesday as film cameras
focused on Dr. Allen Moger of the
History faculty. With the heightened
interest in Constitutional revision in
Virginia, WTAR-TV in Norfolk had
asked Mr. Moger to appear in a one-
hour documentary, which will trace
the development of the state con-
stitution from its colonial inception
up to the newly proposed changes
offered by the present Commission
on Revision

Dr. Moger's interview concerned
the Constitution's growth during the
years immediately following the
Civil War, a period when Virginia
government was embodied in a bitter
controversy over the adjustment of
the state debt. He also discussed the
strong movement for constitutional
revision which occurred just after
the turn of the century. Moger’s
own authoritative work, From Bour-
banism to Byrd, explores many such
governmental dilemmas which arose
during the strenuous Reconstruction

Also interviewed in the broadcast
will be two ardent advocates of the

currently proposed constitutional
changes, former Governor Miles

Godwin and Governor A, Linwood
Holton. The major provision of the
proposals, which face a general re-
ferendum in November, is a plan
that would authorize bonds for capi-
tal improvements. The impetus of the
new bond procedure would likely re-
sult in greater support for public
education and hospitals.

Although he favors the revisions,
Dr. Moger said of the bond provi
sion, “It's one of the most ambigu-

ous things I've ever read—worse
than an insurance policy.” He prais-
ed former Governor Godwin for his
consistent advocacy of the changes,
and termed as “brilliant” the lecture
given at Washington and Lee by
Godwin in 1968 on the subject of the
revisions.

The documentary is scheduled for
broadcast in Norfolk in early Octo-
ber and in other Virginia cities, in-
cluding Roanoke, later in the month.
The script was written by James
E. Mays, news director for WTAR,
and filmed by Tim Hickman, for-

Fancy Dress Is Off,
EC Calls for Forum

BY RITA ENNIS
Another tradition bites the dust.
There will be no Fancy Dress Ball
this year. Skip Nottberg. President
of Dance Board, announced at the
Executive Committee meeting Mon-
day night that because of a greatly
reduced budget and past history of
student disinterest, Fancy Dress has

been cancelled for this year.

 

See Editorial Comment, Page 2

 

In other EC action, the Student
Body “Open Forum” was scheduled
for tonight at 7:00 p.m. in the Cock-
pit. Student Body President Fran
Lawrence commented that he “would
like to make the ‘Open Forums’
monthly events if student interest
warrants it.”

President Lawrence also slated
another set of Freshman EC “Dorm
Conversations” for tomorrow night
The purpose of these conversations
is to discuss student government and
the honor system.

Nottberg presented an extensive
report to EC concerning Dance
Board activities and plans. Concerts
are scheduled for Oct. 9 with the
New York Rock Ensemble and
Sweetwater and Nov. 13 with Char-
lie Byrd. A concert in late February

featuring James Taylor is being
planned. Notiberg said that door
sales from these three concerts
would determine other entertain-

ment. Due to a sharp decrease in
Dance Plan purchases, the Dance
Board is operating on a budget of
about $17,000

The EC heard a report from chair
man Dan Silberberg concerning pro
gress towards the 1972 Mock Con
vention. In addition, the Committee
discussed the Lexington license tags

W @L Selects Law Student

To Serve as Dean’s Aide

The appointment of Larry D.
Jones, a Washington and Lee law
student, as an assistant in the dean of
students’ office has been announced
by Dean of Students Lewis G. John.

Jones, 24, will work with Associ-
ate Dean William McC. Schildt, who
is coordinator of the freshman year.
He is a graduate of Virginia State
College, where he was president of
the Pan Hellenic Council and work-
ed with underclassmen as a dorm
counselor and as an orientation “big
brother.” He began his law studies at
Washington and Lee a year ago and
will continue to take law courses
while occupying his new post

“Mr. Jones’ specific responsibili
ties have not yet been defined,” Dean
Schildt said, “but it was felt that it
would be helpful to have someone
assisting in the special responsibili

ties for programs relating to the
freshman year.”
Jones selected Washington and

Lee Law School because of its high

rating and its “sense of together
ness,” the fact that “no one gets
lost.”

He has enjoyed his first year at

WAL, finding the law school atmos
phere “interesting.” Eventually he
hopes to enter a firm and perhaps
later practice privately

Jones views his
job in the general rather
specific. He hopes to get to know
freshman, especially blacks, and aid
in alleviating disillusionment, help
ing to get oriented to Lexington and
to WAI

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The Dance (On A Tightrope) Board

As we perused dusty past issues of this
newspaper, we noted with considerable inter-
est the proliferation of editorials on the in-
stitution which provides the entertainment
for men of this University—the Dance Board.

In the distant past, the Dance Board made
excellent material for an editorial, The editor
would simply go to a concert the weekend be-
fore and write a brief editorial complimenting
the Dance Board for producing the entertain-
ment, the performers for providing the en-
tertainment and the students for being enter-
tained. Those carefree years are, alas, gone.

Recent years have seen editors propose
all sorts of intricate plans for revamping the
Dance Board in order that the body might
more effectively fight the rising cost of enter-
tainment.

And now we find ourselves joining the
ranks of others immediately preceeding us.
Or do we? Our intent is not so much a pre-
sentation of innovative schemes for Dance
soard president Skip Nottberg to reject or
adopt as it is a presentation of some unpleas-
ant facts and one rather unavoidable conclu-
sion.

The following are the unpleasant facts
which president Nottberg faces:

(1) Last year’s president, Dean Kumpuris,
left a $6,000 deficit, which had to be taken
out of the reserve fund. This left Nottberg
$3,700—a rather unhealthy cushion if the
Dance Board finds itself in debt this year as
well.

(2) Last year, 770 dance plans were sold

-then the least number of dance plans ever
sold. Nottberg and his Board broke the record
this year with sales of only 440 plans and re-
venue totalling an unimpressive $17,500. An
average budget for the Dance Board should

be in the range of $30,000 to $40,000.

(3) Nottherg promised a slate of six dance
weekends; and he intends to fulfill that pro-
mise if the Dance Board has the money.
Three of the weekends are already contracted :
October 9 features Sweetwater and the New
York Rock Ensmble for a total of $6,400; No-
vember 13 is set for Charlie Byrd at $1,750;
and a tentative date in either late February
or the first week in March is planned for
James Taylor to a tune of $7,500. Cost of the
contracted weekends is $15,650. Well, not ex-
actly.

(4) It costs the Dance Board $500 each
time entertainment is planned for Doremus.
Two years ago the University charged $300
for arranging the chairs on the gym floor,
but inexplicably the price has increased, One
presumes this increase is due to inflation.
Since it cost the Dance Board $120 to use the
facilities at VMI two years ago, Nottberg is
attempting to save some money by investigat-
ing the possibility of renting the VMI gym
for the first concert. Even if he does get a re-
duced rate from our neighbors, the majority
of the concerts will have to appear in Doremus
because VMI will not rent their gym during
basketball season. So the cost of the physical
plant for these three contracted concerts is at
best $1,120, which gives a grand total of
$16,770 which will be spent on the contracted

entertainment. And, as the smoke from the
adding machine clears, we find president Nott-
berg and his band of unhappy men with less
than $1,000 to put on three other concerts.

As Nottberg so aptly put it in Monday
night’s Executive Committee meeting, “one-
third of the student body bought dance plans.

.., and they're risking their money for the
entertainment. Whereas, the other two-thirds
of the student body is waiting to see what en-
tertainment is coming.” Nottberg hopes that
the attractions planned will be able to attract
enough people who do not have dance plans
so that the Dance Board will be able to raise
enough money from the sale of $10 a couple
tickets to finance the other three weekends.

Note that he “hopes.” Also note that we
are skeptical about the quality of entertain-
ment that the Dance Board would be able to
provide for the rest of the year with the re-
venue from these door sales. As the situation
is now, Nottberg is gambling by contracting
the entertainment while the students window
shop.

Is this any way to run a Dance Board?
The president of the Dance Board needs to
have some reasonable estimate of what his
budget will be for the coming year before he
can contract the groups which the students
want. The only way he can do his job ade-
quately is to insure him some definite income
for the Dance Board to contract with groups
before the school year begins. And by wit-
nessing the record decrease in dance plan
sales, it appears that not very many students
voluntarily spend $40 on entertainment which
they aren't certain of ever witnessing.

So we actually come to two alternatives,
really. Abolish the Dance Board and establish
an Album Board whereby those who still
thirst for entertainment and excitement can
purchase records at a discount. Or establish a
student entertainment fee whereby each stu-
dent would pay $25 to $30 for a guaranteed
season of top entertainment. We recommend
the latter.

This proposal is nothing new ; neither are
the objections to it. Various individuals have
argued and will argue that the requirement of
an entertainment fee is ludicrous because the
students are being pressed enough for money
as it is and because there are some students
who might not want to attend all of the con-
certs that this proposed revenue would pro-
vide. Yes, the students are required to pay a
small fee for Contact and class dues for cock-
tail parties; surprisingly enough they pay
the fees and a large majority of them attend.
And by the way, would these functions be
even able to rise to a level of mediocrity if
students didn’t have to support them?

We ask the EC to press for the institution
of an entertainment fee which would provide
the Dance Board with a workable yearly bud-
get. If this proposal is rejected and the Dance
Board is left to remain in limbo on a financial
tightrope, then we will have to wish Skip
Nottberg all the luck in the world and urge
that the EC consider an amendment to the
constitution requiring a candidate for the
Dance Board presidency have a year’s experi-
ence in Las Vegas.

The Exchange Program: On The Other Side

Sweet Briar’s Innovation In Education

BY LAWRENCE McCONNELL
AND
MACK WOODWARD

(Editor's Note: Coeducation ap-
pears to be a major issue now fac-
ing small private colleges through-
out the country. Washington and
Lee now finds itself the oldest men’s
university in the United States since
the advent of Princeton University’s
merger with the opposite sex. Yet
even W&L is experimenting with
coeducation as are seven other
schools through an exchange pro-
gram inaugurated this year.

In order to better assess the fu-
ture of W&L and other colleges in
the surrounding area, The Ring-tum
Phi editorial board plans a series of
four interviews with college officials
from Sweet Briar, Hollins, Mary
Baldwin, and Rando!ph-Macon to
ascertain their evaluation of the fu-
ture of theiv colleges with respect to

q

This week's interview was conduct.
ed last Thursday with the president
of Sweet Briar College, Mrs. Anne
Pannell. Mrs. Pannell has served the
college as president for 21 years and
had a vast background in education
before she became the college's
president.

The Ring-tum Phi appreciates
Mrs, Pannell’s graciousness in al-
lowing us to present this taped, tran-
scribed interview.

Her views on coeducation and the
future of Sweet Briar College are be-
low. We hope you, the reader, find
them as enlightening as we did.)

Ring-tum Phi: Why did Sweei
Briar decide to participate in the
exchange program and what does
the college hope to benefit from the
program?

Mrs. Anne Pannell: E xperimenta-
tion and innovation, We've been pio-
neers in the Junior Year Abroad
Program since the 1930's. We've had
exchange programs with the Uni-
versity of St. Andrew's and the Uni-
versity of Paris, so we are great be-
lievers in the year or semester of
exchange. We've had exchange pro-
grams with my alma mater, Barnard
College in New York We've had
girls going on the Washington Se-
mester, and the U.N, Semester and
we've always felt that for the highly
trained, highly motivated girl that
these are special experiences that
might have value

We saw this simply as another ex
periment in exchange, which we be
lieve in. The educational process can
be enriched by many experiences

R+ Phi: Do you think that your
being a women's college has affected
your admissions policy?

Pannell: Oh, well, we hope to re
main a women's college. My special
conviction is that there is and will
continue to be a place for the wo-
mens college. Coeducation is the
commonest thing in America: you
can get ii On every street corner and

diversity is of

be people who want to come to the
uni-sex college and they ought to
have an opportunity and place to
come,

R-t Phi: Do you think that this is
one of the assets of Sweet Briar?

Pannell; Oh, yes, I believe very
definitely in a small, residential, one
sex college that tries to be extremely
good and believes very deeply in
what it is doing—and why it is do-
ing it.

R-t Phi: How many men are you
expecting?

Pannell: Oh, I don't think we're
going to have but two,

R-t Phi: There are more than two
at Hollins College, is there any rea-
son why there are so few at Sweet
Briar?

Pannell: Well, they had to pass
their respective deans, you know.
We said we wouldn't take anybody
unless they had a respectable aca-
demic reason for coming. We're not
anxious to just have men as men
with nothing else to recommend
them. We have no prejudice, gen-
tlemen, against men, but we are a
college and we want people to come
here, you know, if they wanted to
study advanced French literature.
or ecology, or ornithology, or art
history. We have certain fields of
economics and liberal arts in which
we feel we do unusual work. If they
had had some legitimate goal in
mind we'd have been happy to re-
ceive them.

R-t Phi: We were wondering about
the problem facing most small col-
leges, that is, money... .

Pannell: Well, this is the greatest
problem facing us in education to-
day, and that is the effect of infla-
tion. | mean I think this affects the
whole future of private education.
Can we afford to finance it in the
future?

R-t Phi: Do you think that in con-
sidering the cost of private educa-
tion, co-education would be benefi-
cial to you?

Pannell: No, to us it would be a
terribly costly thing. We've had stu-
dies made and we estimate that it
would cost us $15 million to buy
the masculine brains to equal the
caliber of girls we have in college.

$15 million to set up the kind of
scholarship program that would
bring the caliber of young man in
here that we want. And think of the
number of restrooms we'd have to
put in. We'd have to change our

dormitories, put in more playing
fields, more athletic coaches, all
those kind of things.

R-t Phi: What are your plans for
development?

Pannell: Oh, well, development.
Yes, we'd like to be a college; we're
a college of about 700—700 is our
residential capacity, and we give a
full scholarship to any girl from this
county. So we always have 15 to 40
day students on scholarship and we
would like to be a college of a thou-
sand to 2000. We think that’s the
ideal size—anything after that begins
to be impersonal. We'd like, again,
to use our campus and these enorm-
ous resources for ecological studies.

We do have so much land that
we feel guilty—socially; we feel we
want to fulfill our social respon-
sibilities to use our magnificient set-
ting for as much social good as we
can.

We are in the midst of a cam-
paign to raise funds to invest in peo-
ple in more scholarship resources
and faculty and research.

Coeducation often comes up, |
mean it's not something we put un-
der the carpet or treat lightly. We
have no prejudice against men, and
about fifty percent or better of our
faculty are men. But we're the only
college in the South that has women
administrators. We go the ultimate
of believing that women can parti-

Letters To The Editor...

Kappa Sigma Alumni

See Faults In System

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

The recent demise of Mu Chap-
ter of Kappa Sigma should be a
cause for concern for the admini-
stration and student body of Wash-
ington and Lee. It is such a cause
for many of us who were members
of that chapter in the past.

First of all, it is normal for men,
in all walks of life, to organize them-
selves into groups of mutual interests
and benefits. Thus, those who delight
in the destruction of the fraternity
system should consider that other
forms of such associations, such as
eating clubs, will very probably arise
to replace fraternities. Of course,
these other social organizations will

only be able to grow and function if
the freedom of the university com-
munity is not totally destroyed,

Second, the appeal to past mem-
bers of Mu Chapter to help save the
dying house was made at a point be-
yond which such help could have
been effective. Many, including in-
terested and responsible members of
the faculty, members and officers of
the chapter, and, in large part, the
administration had a_ responsibility
to inform us at a time when the
chapter could have been saved.

Of course, some will seize on an
excuse that the chapter was a part
of a national fraternity, which
should be accountable. But anyone
who has been at W&L knows that
its fraternities are basically local!
houses, more a part of the campus

and more responsible to the unti-
versity than to their nationals,

it is very easy to destroy by fail-
ing to act in time. And that is what
occurred, We who were part of Mu
Chapter at one time are very sad-
dened and dismayed that no one
felt obligated to let us know in time,
because we would have liked to help
while such aid might have worked.

Those who are part of the still
functioning fraternity chapters at
W&L can take warning from Mu
Chapter’s sad end. They should know
that the health of a chapter at any
one period is not a guarantee of its
continued health, particularly its fi-
nancial viability, at any future time.

The lesson is that like the survival!
of any free institution, the continu-

A Look At The Old Coach

BY PALMER TRICE

“Alright you guys, push it! Push
‘! Get to the next flag, you get cx-
tra points! Let’s move it”. This awe-
inspiring roar greeted freshmen on
their second or third day on campus,
as physical education placement
tests were given by Coach Norman
F. Lord. The tests were simple to
comprehend, but, to say the least,
grizzly to execute. After a summer
of fun and frolic, few of us were
prepared to run for 12 minutes. The
objective set by this commanding
stranger was six laps, or a mile and
a half. The run was started and the
puffing began.

Lightning Valley Is Here

BY ROBERT BAROODY

If you walk past the Dutch Inn
you might notice a new sign pro-
claiming the existence of the
“Lightning Valley Food Store”,
which is probably the most enlight-
ened enterprise ever to be begun in
Lexington.

An idea of student Matt Cliett,
the health food store opened for
business early this week and will be
open weekdays from about 10 a.m.
to 6 p.m. Soon to be featured at the
LVFS will be a genuine stone mill,
which will allow the customer to se-
lect the exact texture of his flour.

The following interview was with
Roger Cook and Richard Dillon,
two graduates of W&L who run the
store with Cliett:

However, we were not to be left
alone in our torture. Every minute
on the minute, a booming voice sang
out the time remaining. As time be-
gan to grow short the voice gave
not only the time, but psychological
lifts also. We were urged to pick up
our feet and to get to the next flag,
which was located 110 yards away.
“Push it, push it, push it!” Follow-
ing the running, a swimming test
was given. After this we were either
placed into or chose a P.E, class,
Sul the most memorable part of the
day was the running test.

&
to do is to open up the possibility
of a much larger menu in this town.
You know, people in this town eat
the same thing every day. It’s boring
food!

Roger Cook: And there’s a lot of
joy in experimenting. Most people
I've met are afraid to try different
things. When they walk into a res-
taurant they're afraid to look at the
menu: they look very quickly to see
if the place has something they
know that they will like.

Dillon: When some people hear
something that’s different they im-
mediately become skeptics. Roger
and I aren't skeptics, and we're
willing to open up our taste buds to
see the difference.

R-t Phi: Isn't eating health foods
considered a fad?

Dillon: Western Civilization may
be a fad.

ton and Lee. We met under a tree in
front of Doremus Gymnasium. First,
our instructor introduced himself.
“The name is Lord, L-O-R-D. You
can call me Lord, Coach Lord, or
—!Some incomprehensible foreign
phrase which means “Super Chief.”
We were all turned toward Dore-
mus, in its poor state, that is, with
few lockers or showers and no hot
water, “You are a part of history,”
we were told. Fifty years ago this
gym was being built. There weren't
any showers or lockers then either.
He then explained our objectives.
“When you run, you burn oxygen.”
Also, despite the fact that some peo-
ple would not want him to say this,
“it's good for you to sweat!” This
was followed by an interesting and
biologically precise explanation of
why it is good to perspire. In order
to aid his keeping track of us, he
told us “put your name on your
shirt nipple high, in block letters,”

For the first time in my life, I
was told to buy a text book for phy-
sical education; The New Aerobics
—that’s ae ro bics not ae ro’ bics.
Coach Lord, whose name by unani-
mous consent, fits him perfectly, ex-
plained that the program had first
been tried “on a group of studs,”
After it worked on them, they tried
it on all kinds of people: old peo-
ple, out of shape people, sick and
crippled people. It worked for all of
them. It will work for us, despite
the fact that the class meets but two
days a week. “I only have your
bodies twice a week. I wish I had
your bodies for more time. “The
USAF has adopted this exercise pro-
gram, as it was found in “Dr. Coop-
er’s eagerly awaited 2nd book for

Rugby Club Opens New Fall Schedule

BY STEVE GREENE

The Washington and Lee rugby
team features plenty of experience
as they face their upcoming fall
schedule. Tommy Baker, president
of the rugby club, expressed extreme
optimism as the rugby team for the
first time plays a fall schedule. In
the past they have only competed in
the spring.

Baker stated that he has 35 players
out and termed that very good. He
added “' to % of them are experi-
enced, A lot of the players are Law

students who competed in undergra-
duate school.”

Last year in the spring season the
team compiled a 4-3-1 record and
Baker thinks they can better that.
This year, with the surplus of play-
ers, there will be an A and B team.
The B team will play its games
immediately before the A game.

This year’s captain of the rugby
team is Allen GaNun. All games
start at 2:00 on the upper field next
to the baseball field. One other note
is that beer parties will be after

every game for the players.

ate his abilities. Aged 51, he has
been at W&L for 24 years. He gra-
duated from the University of Dela
ware and got his Masters at Spring-
field College. Before coming to Lex-
ington, the taught and coached at his
alma mater, and toured as a visiting
professor at Springfield for a year.
Now he is a Lt. Col. in the Army
Reserve and a professor of Physical
Education at W&L. He fought in
World War II and later in Korea.
In 1946, he served as a civilian ath-
letic consultant to the Dept. of the
Army. He helped put out the US.
Army manual.

Coach Lord definitely practices
what he preaches. His physical fit-
ness is astounding, and his attitude
toward a usually dull course is re-
freshing.” Handball is ice cream, he
says, “meaning that football and the
like are the meat and potatoes, and
the lesser sports are dessert... .

That's L-O-R-D ! !

Penn State’s Demise

 

vaunted Big Blue was trampled by
a herd of Buffaloes—Colorado var-
iety. The loss was the first for Penn
State in thirty-one ball games, break-
ing a twenty-three game winning
streak that dated back to a 17-17
Gator Bowl tie with Florida State
in 1967.

Saturday's statistics are but his-
tory now, but as State’s head coach
Joe Paterno summed it up in the
newspapers, “We were outcoached,
outplayed, outhit, and outscored.”

But, upon reflection, Penn State
need not feel angry at itself for
blowing the game. Indeed, Colorado,
by its performance, has to be rec-
koned with as one of the nation’s
strongest clubs. The Golden Buffs’
defense formed an almost inpene-
trable barrier against an offense
which had rolled up fifty-five points
against Navy a week earlier, And

 

the offense ignited for forty-one
points, the most scored on the Nit-
tany Lions’ defense in a long, long,
time,

Pass after pass and play after
play, Colorado could do no wrong.
Although perhaps Saturday was just
a bad day for Penn State, I feel that
Colorado could take the Blue seven
times out of ten tries with maybe
one tie thrown in,

Colorado’s strength may yet bring
ringing cheers of enthusiasm and a
possible Big Eight championship to
Folsom Field in Boulder. Anyway,
that Colorado-Nebraska face-off sev-
eral weeks from now should be a
real ding-dong battle, in a confer-
ence once referred to as “Oklahoma
and the Seven Dwarfs.”

So no wthat number four-ranked
Penn State no longer owns the long-
est winning streak, who does? Ob-
noxious Texans really have some-
thing to crow about besides that
silly tower with the orange lights.

The Longhorns of the University
of Texas, after beating hapless Texas
Tech, 35-13, have gone unbeaten
through twenty-two consecutive

 

The General Soccer Team opened its season with a heartbreaking 1-0
defeat to northeastern power, Dickinson College, at Carlisle, Pennsyl-
vania. The Dickinson team, which is well into its season, had to hussle
to whip the Blue and White. The Generals play host to the Lynchburg
College Hornets at home on Wednesday.

Towson Trounces W&L, 34-14

In an interview before the game,
the Washington and Lee team physi-
sian, who requested to be kept an-
onymous, diagnosed the team’s prob-
lem as Offense Syndrome or in lay-
men’s terms, a lack of offense. The
Towson State Tigers capitalized
early on the disease to roll to a 34-
14 heated victory over the mighty
Blue,

If the coin toss is any indication
of who's going to have the luck
throughout the game, the Tigers
started out on the right foot. They
took the opening kickoff and march-
ed 70 yards to score the initial touch-
down climaxed by a 40 yard off-
tackle slant with 12:31 remaining
in the first quarter. The PAT was
good and the score stood 7-0. The
remainder of the first quarter stood
as a tight defense struggle, the Gen-
erals receiving excellent play from
Scott Neese, Dave Brooks and Frank
Evans. The opposing punters saw
plenty of action, each punting away
three times in the offensive stale-
mate,

The second quarter opened with
the General defensive unit forcing a
Tiger fumble on the W&L 21 yard
line to thwart a 35 yard march. But
all goodness soon ended as a tough

rush on quarterback Tom Van Am-
burgh batted the ball into the air
and a Tiger defensive lineman snat-
ched it and darted 35 yards for a
touchdown with 12:07 left in the
half. The conversion was good and
the score mounted in State’s favor,
14-0.

The Offensive Syndrome held
tightly on the Generals as they had
to punt away the next two times
they got the ball. But on their third
possession, a fumble recovery by the
Tigers on the W&L 38 yard line
spelled their certain doom. Two
plays later, a 33 yard pass com-
pletion put the Tigers on the W&L
2 yard line. Despite twice throwing
the Tigers back, the Generals could
not stop a 2 yard plunge with 5:29
left in the half. After the conversion,
the scoreboard told the grim story,
21-0.

Towson State just wouldn't give
up. They intercepted a Van Am-
burgh bomb, their second of the
half, on their own 32 yard line. Sev-
eral plays later, an arching 57 yard
touchdown pass through the Gen-
erals prevent defense with 1:19 left
vaulted the score to 27-0. The extra
point was blocked.

The Blue received the second half

 

kickoff but failed to move. Towson
immediately took possession and
guided itself 60 yards for a touch-
down only 1:40 into the third quar-
ter. The climax was a 43 yard off-
tackle sprint. The PAT was good
and the score stood an overwhelm-
ing 34-0. No offensive progress for
the Generals forced their seventh
punt of the game. Towson State
promptly moved to the W&L 20
yard line only to attempt a field goal
of 38 yards. which fell short. At this
point, Steve Fluharty, a sophomore,
came into the game to guide the
General's offense. For the first time
in the game, the offensive unit came
to light. Fluharty marched the team
from his own 20 to State’s 13 with
the completion of three passes to
Bruce Green and the help of a pen-
alty. The drive was thwarted though
by a Tiger interception at the 2.
But the Generals were rejuvenated,
and the defense handed Fluharty
the ball on the Towson State 41
after a short punt. With a pressure
completion to Green and a pass in-
terference call on Towson in the end
zone, the ball found its way to the
State 1 yard line. On the next play,
freshman Jim Farrar barreled over
with 1:00 left in the third quarter to
put the first W&L points on the
board. Green was on the receiving

 

fourth and short yardage situation
failed and the mighty Blue stalled.
Later, W&L received a punt on their
own 42 and following two comple-
tions to Green, one to the 2 yard
line, Jim Farrar battled his way over
for his second touchdown. The pass
conversion fell no good, the gun
sounded and the score ended 34-14.

Outstanding offensive _ perfor-
mances came from Steve Fluharty,
who completed 13 of 31
176 yards, and Green

who ended the day with 12 big re-

attempts

for Bruce

ceptions for 160 yards.

it impossible to print its contents in

that it has lost any of its impact in

Macrobiotic Diet Made Possible
By Lightning Valley Food Store

(Continued from Page 3)

R-t Phi: How does a person eat
well:

Cook: By using his judgment in
what he eats; by knowing what food
is, and how particular foods affect
him.

R-t Phi: Are there any specific
foods that you would recommend?

Dillon: No, A man can eat any-
thing in the whole world.

Cook: Everybody should eat what
they want to eat.

"R-t Phi: Is there any system or philo-
sophy behind eating well?

Cook: There’s the macrobiotic
philosophy, about which we have
some written material available in
the store. The store itself is not push
ing macrobiotics; we're just present-
ing it as a possibility to anyone who's
interested.

R-t Phi: Well, just what is macro-
biotics?

Dillon: I'd say that macrobiotics
is a very highly concentrated mede-

cine. Georges Oshawa, known as the
father of macrobiotics, claimed that
he could prevent or cure any disease
by prescribing a man’s diet,

Cook: As for ourselves, we're no
more macrobiotics than we are Niet-
zschean or Kantian, It’s just another
philosophy, but there’s a lot you
can learn from it.

Dillon: We're not trying to have
a peculiar kind of Japanese food,
because that’s a cult thing.

R-t Phi:
chopsticks?

Dillon: What you can do is use
your toes...

R-t Phi: Do you agree that eating
good food can have an effect on the
mind?

Cook: Yes, definitely. If you con-
trol and balance your diet you can
think more clearly.

R-t Phi: Why is the average
American meal bad for a person?

Cook: Mainly because it’s so chao-
tic. There’s no understanding of what
he’s eating and hardly any style as
to how he prepares and eats his
food.

R-t Phi: Why have you called the
place the “Lightning Valley Food
Store”?

Dillon: It's a good image.

R-t Phi: Where do the foods in
the LVFS come from?

Cook: We order from Boston,
New York, Texas, Pennsylvania...
from all over the country.

R-t Phi: Do you have anything
that comes from Rockbridge County?

Cook: As a matter of fact we
have some apple blossom honey
from “Honey Bill” Jarvis who has
some bees at his place near Rock-
bridge Baths.

R-t Phi: What has been the re-
sponse of the Lexington Commun
ity to a health food store?

Dillon: Excellent.

Cook: Everyone thinks it’s a good
idea and that we'll be successful.

R.t Phi: Is it expensive to eat
natural foods?

Dillon: No. You can make some

R-t Phi: At such low prices will
the LVFS break even?

Cook: Yes, but we certainly don't

R-t Phi: What should one do if he

Pulitzer Prize Winner To
Visit W@L Campus Soon

(Continued from Page 1)

Mr. Howard will speak on “the
development of a new literary form”
which he perceives as currently de-
veloping, and which he says must
“create the taste by which it is en-
joyed,”

He will also read from his own
works during a separate program
while at Washington and Lee.

His Pulitzer Prize-winning collec-
tion, published in 1969, was followed
by “Alone With America—Studies in
the Art of Poetry in the United
States Since 1950,” which was nomi-
nated for the National Book Award
this year,

In 1971, Mr. Howard will become
Swiggett-Baines Distinguished Lec-
turer in poetry at Princeton Univer-
sity,

Born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1929,
he was educated at Columbia Uni
versity in New York and at the Sor-
bonne in Paris.

Dance Board Tells Line-up

is “a synthesis of classical, rock, jazz.
and folk—with all playing an equal
part. Rock is the basic foundation.”
Tickets for the one-night concert
will be available at the door for the
price of $10 per couple. Dance plans
may still be purchased at the $40
price in the Co-op.
