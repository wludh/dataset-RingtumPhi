Class of 1974
Rated ‘Strong’
LARGEST EVER

Freshman Dorms Include
Two Former Fraternities

The entering freshman class is
one of the strongest academically
and one of the most diverse in other
characteristics ever admitted to
WEL, according to admissions di-
rector James D. Farrar.

The 384 students, composing the
largest freshman class ever, ranked
in the top 21 per cent of their sec-
ondary school classes on a statistical
average, he said. One year ago. the
WAL freshman average was four
points lower.

The average scores on the sian-
dard Scholastic Achievement Tests
(SATs) for the class of 1974 were
610 on the mathematics section and
574 on the verbal, according to the
admissions director.

Of the new freshmen, 68 per cent
graduated from public high schools
and 32 per cent from private schools.

Thirty-four states and the District
of Columbia are represented in the
entering class. Virginia sends the
largest number of students, 98;
Maryland has the second largest rep-
resentation, with 36.

Two vacant former fraternity
houses are being used as dormitories
for 42 members of the freshman
class.

The need to place entering fresh-
men outside the main university
dormitories arose this spring when
an unusually large number of young
men accepted admission offers.
‘Though the university was more se-
lective in offering admission than a
year ago, the proportion of those stu-
dents who decided to attend W&L
was up more than five per cent.

The KA house, located about two
blocks from Washington and Lee's
main campus, will be called “Nelson
House.” The SPE house is about
three blocks from campus, and will
be known as “Preston House.”

Aside fro mthe freshman class,
there are other new people and
things in the W&L works this year.

In years past, when new siudents
had relatively little to about

Huntley Sees Broad Pessimism

BY ROGER MUNSICK

President Robert E. R. Huniley
warned Washington and Lee students
of “the fragile nature of the educa-
tional enterprise” during the course
of the University’s traditional Open-
ing Assembly conducted yesterday
at noon in Evans Dining Hall,

Huntley, after welcoming the stu-
dents back, expressed his thoughts
on the atmosphere of college open-
ings throughout the country in this
particular “new September”, stating
that the usual tone of anticipation
may well have been replaced by an
“atmosphere of tension and gloom”
among the academic community.

In contrast to the outwardly bleak
picture on a national front, Huntley
cited the vast potential that is Wash-
ington and Lee’s for the upcoming
year. The faculty and students, it
appeared to the president, are “more
knowledgable and aware” than ever
before. The student body has, after
vast amounts of work, the oppor-
tunity for new curriculum programs,
as well as chances for “self-develop-
ment” outside the classroom.

Opening Term Sees Faculty I ncreased
As University Announces 14 Additions

Fourteen new professors have
joined the Washington and Lee fac-
ulty for the 1970-71 academic year.

Dr. William W. Pusey Ill, Dean
of the College, said 10 of the newly
named faculty members will teach
in the university’s arts and sciences
division. Dr. Edward C. Atwood Jr.,
dean of the School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics, announced
one new appointment, and Dean
Roy L. Steinheimer of the School of
Law announced three.

E. William Johnson will join the
staff of the economics department
for the 1970-71 year to replace a
professor who will be on leave.
Johnson, who is currently complet-
ing work on his Ph.D. degree at the
University of Virginia, will hold the
rank of insiructor at WAL.

The President stated that in place
of ordinary school opening “annoy-
ances,” other, more sinister factors
are present at this particular time.
“Instead of fellowship, there may be
alienation and humorless isolation:
instead of scholarship, there may be
rude epithets and hollow self es-
teem.”

Huntley saw several broad rea-
sons for “the special pessimism”
gripping campuses today. He ac-
knowledged sociological studies that
found youth alienated from the
American society, questioning injus-
tice. He recognized surveys attribut-
ing canmypus unrest to a breakdown
in family unity and in religion.

The financial crisis confronting
the universities was also cited as a
cause for alarm. College administra-
tors are constantly queried by pro-
spective donors as to the value of
educational institutions existing
amidst turmoil.

The final portion of the Presi-
dent’s address dealt with the com-
ments of Robert Nisbet, a professor
of sociology at the University of
California at Riverside. It is the
particular nature of educational
freedom that it is susceptible to a
chipping away of values by militant
minorities, individuals who ignore
authority. “Power,” President Hunt-
ley warned, “is the invariable re-
sponse to shattered authority.”

Universities, Huntley said, can-
not merely witness their own de-

J. Sanford Doughty, former direc-

In another development office
change, Maj. Gerald E. Poudrier of
Lexington, a member of the Wash-
ington and Lee University’s Reserve
Officer Training Corps staff since
1966, became director of annual
giving in W&L’s development of-
fice, succeeding William C. Tyler.

Doughty, as associate director,
will share responsibility for the over-
all operation of W&L's development
activities with Farris P. Hotchkiss,
director of the office since 1967,
Hotchkiss will begin spending more
time preparing and carrying out
special projects, President Huntiey
said in making the announcement,

Poudrier, in the capacity of direc-
tor of annual giving, will supervise
operation of the Parents’ Fund and
be responsible together with WAL’s
Alumni Association for the Alumni
Fund. In addition, Poudrier will

the development office on a wide
range of special projects.

struction, yet at the same time he
opposes “a proliferation of policy
statements, rules which dehumanize
and brutalize institutions.”

As he pointed out in his Com-
mencement address of 1969, Hunt-
ley stated again that “Washington
and Lee is not a microcosm.” He
added, however that “this campus
need not politicize itself.”

In conclusion, President Huntley
told the University that “to trust
much is to risk much,” and called
upon students to accept this chal-
lenge.

Huntley’s remarks were preceded
by a series of introductions conduct-

Law School Men
Named to State,
National Posts

Two Washington and Lee men
have recently been honored with
government appointments.

Dean Roy L. Steinheimer Jr. of
the School of Law has been named
to head a special White House task
force investigating ways of explain-
ing the American legal system to the
country’s children.

Andrew W. McThenia Jr., an as-
sOciate professor in the School of
Law and legal advisor to the col-
lege, was named to the Virginia
Water Control Board by Gov. Lin-
wood Holton.

Dean Steinheimer'’s 15-member
panel is expected to complete its in-
vestigation and to submit a report
and recommendations to the White
House Conference on Children and
Youth, scheduled this December.

His committee's report, together
with findings of other Children and
Youth Conference study teams, will
then be submitted to President Rich-
ard Nixon,

Dean Steinheimer said his group
is “plowing new ground” in carrying
out its assignment. “Very little has
been done so far in trying to educate
American children on the sources of
law and the reasons for having
laws.”

The group will emphasize bring-
ing the message of law to pre-high-
school children, Dean Steinheimer
said,

Mr. McThenia, appointed to the
Virginia Water Control Board for
a four-year term, is a lawyer spec-
ializing in environmental protection.

Mr. McThenia teaches courses in
legal approaches to preserving the
environment and natural resources,
contracts, equily, and federal anti-
trust laws.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
September 17, 1970

A Birthday For The Newspaper
With That Funny Name

Ring-tum Phi, stickeri bum,
We're hot stuff from Lexington.
Rah, rah, rah, White and Blue,
Whoopla, Whoopla, W.L.U.

Sounding more like the name for a pre-school fraternity
than for a student newspaper, The Ring-tum Phi acquired its
awkward title from this college cheer which was popular in
1897, Though the cheer has been long and perhaps thankfully
forgotten, our name has remained—if nothing else as a lasting
tribute to the power of the press.

Though The Ring-tum Phi was not published for three
years during World War II, the publication of this edition
marks its official 70th birthday. We have chosen therefore to
reprint a copy of our very first edition to commemorate those
students who, over the 70 years of the newspaper's existence,
have found some inexplicable entrancement with the simple
act of putting lead type and wood blocks into a metal frame.

They loved every minute of it. So do we.

About Volume LXX...

The Ring-tum Phi is 70 years old now—officially. For us as
for many, this little morsel of information might as well be in-
cluded in an almanac for cocktail chatter were it not for a
slight shade of difference between the facts that The Ring-tum
Phi is 70 and there are over 85,000 species of flies. And that
shade of difference is shrouded in a mysterious word: “pride.”

On page three of our Number 1 is a facsimile of the first
The Ring-tum Phi ever published. Though its contents make it
somewhat of a curiosity rather than an historical document, we
can well imagine that the editors of the 1897 rag sensed a rather
elusive and somewhat archaic phenomenon: “school spirit.”
Roughly translated in the argo of today’s “with-it” generation,
the men of 1897 took pride in their University.

Intrinsically, we find much the same motivation for the
publication of Volume LXX, although we write about quite a
different University than the one of 1897. To say that 1970
is a landmark of changes for Washington and Lee is almost an
understatement. Freshmen did not board the buses for Na-
tural Bridge this year but remained on campus for a four day
orientation on campus. They along with the rest of the student
body registered for a three term academic year. And they are
attending classes with women. (Would the editors of the 1897
Ring-tum Phi be agast if they knew the 1970 newspaper edi-
tors allowed a woman on their staff?)

Significant and valuable changes have been wrought for
the University. Yet the process of experimentation has only
begun. It remains to be seen whether coeducation will be an
enduring academic and social asset for the Washington and
Lee community. With the miniscule number of women on the
campus this year, we doubt whether their presence will make
an impact significant enough to be evaluated.

Will the 12-12-6 program enacted this year prove to have
all of its highly touted advantages over the school’s traditional
two semester system? This too is an experiment which must
be studied and reviewed as the year progresses.

Thoughtful, careful, almost tedious planning went into
W&L’s co-educational and short term experiments. And no
doubt more experimentation is to be made. Washington and
Lee has entered a most critical point in its long history—one
which requires the sort of enthusiasm which the 1897 editors
felt for their school coupled with the judicious thought and
appraisal which characterizes President Wilson's inaugural
address before the University.

As Washington and Lee's weekly student newspaper, The
Ring-tum Phi then as now is dedicated to serving the Uni-
versity’s students, faculty, administration, parents and alumni.
We hope to provide a forum for the expression of opinion by
anyone within the university community, and we trust that
then as now, you the reader will “lay down a part of your time
and money in order to advance the fame of your alma mater.”

1970: The Y

BY JOHN ROBINSON

The Freshmen class of 1970 will
be the first group to experience sev-
eral substantial changes on the Wash-
ington and Lee campus. Among
these changes are a new curriculum,
eliminaiion of a Natural Bridge-
based Freshman Camp and a defer-
red rush system. Let’s examine these
changes briefly and evaluate their
merits and faults,

First and foremost of all changes
is the renovated curriculum. The se-
mester system has been sacked in
favor of a three term academic year.
The fall term ends before Christmas.
This is a terrific improvement be-
cause now freshmen will be through
with exams when the December

 

     

BY GREG RAETZ

For over a century fraternities
have been an integral part of the
student life at Washington and Lee.
Traditionally, the vast majority of
students have joined fraternities and
stayed in them through their four
years here.

However, in the past two years,
and particularly in the last year, the
trend has been away from fraternity
affiliation. For the first time in de-
cades fraternity membership is be-
low 50 per cent of the student body.
Last year three fraternities dissolved
in one form or another and there
are persistent rumors that more will
follow this year.

Why? There are a number of rea-
sons, but there is one often forgotten
which seems to tie many of the
others together. The reason is sim-
ply that faculty and administration
are anti-fraternity.

There have been several occur
rances in the last year that come to
mind that tend to highlight this fact.
Last September dorm students were
given weekend parietals, but it was
half a year later before fraternity
residents were given the same privi-
leges.

The first night of formal rush this
fall a combo with Hollins freshmen
was held in the University Center.
Coincidence? Perhaps the most dif-
ficult challenge that fraternities will
face this year is deferred rushing
Without the revenue from pledges
for two months several fraternities
face financial disaster.

Anti-fraternity sentiment seems

Through a Spyglass Darkly . . .

The Rush From Fraternity

break comes. Likewise the winter
term concludes prior to the Easter
break and the short spring term of-
fers a unique opportunity for either
concentrated study or research out-
side of Lexington.

The new curriculum also means
more flexibility to incoming men. In
previous years the freshman year
was crammed full of required dis-
tribution courses. This is no longer
the case. Starting this year, a fresh-
man can enroll in several courses in
his major field. Also, more electives
are available to the Class of 1974,
meaning a broader field of study
than ever available to students at
WAL,

In general, the remodeled curri-

sstentestececas

to stem from the belief that fraterni-
ties are “too” conservative, and
therefore roadblocks to “higher edu-
cation.” The selective methods of
choosing their memberships and
their “closed” nature are often at-
tacked, They are even criticized for
being “anti intellectual”. (Maybe it’s
because some fraternity members
wear coats and ties and not the “in-
tellectual” dirty blue jeans and slept-
in shirts.)

No one is trying to say that fra-
ternities are perfect, but they aren't
sO Obsolete that they must be dis-
carded either. They have and they
must continue to change with the
needs, hopes and goals of the men
who make up their memberships. As
long as they can do this, they should
survive,

Just about the only alternative to
fraternities is university-owned dor-
mitories for the entire student body.
Besides the great expense of building
such fraternities, they would do
nothing to alter the bonds which
exist between all men of similar in-
teresis and goals—and, after all, isn’t
this what fraternities are made of?

 

culum spells out several benefits to
all students at W&L. First, the flexi-
bility is increased by reducing the
number of distribution requirement
courses. Secondly, the specialized
study possibility is greater improved
by the six-week term in April and
May.

However, these changes have nec-
essitated some inconvenience. The
most obvious of these is afternoon
classes, Another is more frequent
class scheduling conflicts. Often-
times, required courses are not offer-
ed each of the three terms. Despite
these mentioned problems with our
new curriculum, the advantages
greatly overshadow any problems
brought with the new plan.

For two decades all freshmen
have endured three days in Natural
Bridge called Freshman Camp, The
accommodations were bad and the
presentations were worse. It seemed
obvious that there was a basic fall-
acy in holding orientation in Na-
tural Bridge—how can you intro-
duce freshmen to the Washington
and Lee University by sending them
away from the campus?

Reason has finally prevailed this
year and orientation was conducted
at the Lexington campus, primarily
at the Student Center. Nonetheless,
several problems arose, Presenta-
tions were poorly attended and no-
body seemed in charge of the whole
operation, The Executive Commit-
tee, and its University Center Orien-
tation Committee, along with Focus
were all active but none seemed tre-
mendously organized. Granted that
this was the first time that orienta-
tion was held in Lexington, but some
basic errors were committed, The
plan was laudible, the execution left
quite a bit to be desired. Some in-
dividual must take complete charge
of orientation for everything to
come off smoothly.

Finally, the once powerful frater-
nities were struck a hard blow this
year. Deferred rush was put into
effect and the results may be termi-
nal for some houses.

It was felt by many that WAL’s
fraternities conducted rush too soon
Over too short a period of time.

 

ear of the Guinea Pig

Therefore, the faculty instructed the
Interfraternity Council to establish a
deferred rush plan, The number of
open houses and rush dates remain-
ed virtually unchanged. The only
major change is that rush dates are
held one night every week until late
in October. This boils down to
stretching a one week system out for
six weeks.

During these six weeks, the most
ridiculous rule is the no contact
order, Freshmen cannot go see fra-
ternity men for fear of “dirty rush”,
This rule will not hurt upperclass-
men nearly as badly as it will injure
the freshmen, It seems that this sys-
tem handicaps the freshmen that de-
ferred rush was specifically designed
to benefit.

So freshmen are to be the guinea
pigs of three new systems at W&L.
All three, the new curriculum, fresh-
man Orientation, and deferred rush,
have obvious merits. But all have
obvious faults, faults that must be
cleared up in the future.

Gas was chosen because it burns

Catise a gas heating plant is less ex-

Goodby.

 

We say it for an hour or for years;
We say it with smiling, say it choked with
tears;
We say it coldly, say it with a kiss,
And yet we have no other word than this:
Goodby.

We have no dearer word for our heart's friend,
For him who journeys to the world’s far end
And scars our soul with going; the way we
say
As unto him who steps but o’er the way:
Goodby.

Alike to them we love and those we hate,
We say no more in parting. At life’s gate
To him who passes out beyond earth’s sight,
We cry, as to the wanderer for a light:
Goodby.

 

Show Your College Spirit—
Have You Done Your Duty
in This Respect?

There are some things which, though not
put down in the catalogue as a part of the
student's duties, every one should do.

The first of these things is the joining of
the Athletic Association. Athletics at Wash-
ington and Lee never had a brighter outlook
than this season, Last year we had good ma-
terial on our teams, and they played well to-
gether. The only thing which kept us from
having a more glorious success than we did
have was the lack of support of the student
hody. The managers were unable to make the
dates, which are needed for a successful sea-
son, because of the lack of money. Let this not
be the case this year. You can rely on the
managers to do everything in their power to
get good dates, but we cannot expect them to
pay all the guarantees out of their own poc-
kets,

Last year the football manager had to pay
*sinety odd dollars from his own funds in
-order to meet the expenses of the team and
the baseball manager had to forward nearly
as large a sum. Every man who does not join
the association is responsible in part for this.
Mr. Lisle, the manager of the football team,
has been at work ever since last spring secur-
ing games. He hopes to have our team play
the University of North Carolina, Roanoke,
Richmond college, Kentucky A, and M., col-
lege, University of West Virginia, Louisville
Athletic Club, Vanderbilt, and Sewanee, be-
sides our series of games with our neighbors,
the Cadets. Whether we play all of these

games remains to be decided by you.

Opportunity to earn cash money
in your spare time. We have a limit-
ed number of openings for special
banquet waiters,

Contact Mr. Darrell or Cy Dillon
at Evans Dining Hall,

No experience required.

Second. If you would have us win all of
these games, get out on the field and buck up
against the first team. They need a lot of

fellows to give them strong practice.

Third. Subscribe to our monthly literary
magazine, the Collegian. The Collegian ranks
among the first of the college magazines, and
it remains with you whether it will continue
so, Not only should you help the Collegian
by subscribing, but every student should write
for it, so that the editor will have a lot of
good material to select from.

Fourth. You should join one of the literary
societies. They need you, but you need them
much more. If you will go to the Graham or
the Wash, at its first meeting, join, always be
in your place, always do well the work assign-
ed you, you will find at the end of the year
that you have gotten more good from it than

from any ticket you have taken.

Fifth. You should be bubbling over with
college spirit. Be ever ready to support every
good scheme gotten up. It is the fellow that is
full of enthusiasm that makes his mark. In
looking over an old catalogue the other day
we noticed that it is the fellow who took in-
terest in everything around him at college
who is doing the best in the world. Nor let the

thought enter your head that the good stu-
dent is the fellow who leaves all of this out-
side “stuff” alone. The honors at last com-
mencement were nearly all taken up by men
who are prominent as fellows who are ready
at any time to lay down a part of their time
and money in order to advance the fame of
their alma mater.

 

It was with a bosom filled with pride that
the Judge stood on the steps of Newcomb
Hall as our fine, new, red, four-wheeled, two-
horsed sprinkler passed before his admiring
gaze. It takes two men to run this sprinkler.
One drives, the other sees that the water
doesn’t spill. The sprinkler is a mark of pro-
gress, however, and it will lay the dust if it is
only given the time. So don’t laugh.

 

Ain't that sprinkler warm?

Closing Sentences of President

Wilson’s Address

The following are the closing sentences
of the inaugural address of Hon. William L.
Wilson yesterday at Washington and Lee:

If the South is to produce for her own serv-
ice, if she is to contribute, as in days past, to
the whole country statesmen, legislators, and
judges, able to maintain her influence and
proper dignity as a great section of the Ameri-
can union, her sons must continue to give, as
Mr. Blaine declares their fathers gave, “deep
study to the science of government,” and if
amid the hard conditions that confront them
after leaving college they are no longer able
to give that study in the seclusion of their
own libraries, the proper foundations for it
must be laid in the schools of learning.

Let it not be understood that such studies
are designed to train recruits for any partisan
camp, still less to mould them to the views of
any teacher. | am no disbeliever in sturdy
partnership that seeks through political or-
ganization the highest good of the country ;
but it is to generate and develop the desire
and the power of independent, original re-
search, to foster the habit and the ability of
independent judgment; to acquaint men with
the origin and the historic growth of our in-
stitutions, with the fundamental principles of
government, and so to enrich them with the
results of human experience that they can
decide on this or that policy as it may
strengthen or weaken our freedom, this or
that economic doctrine as it may advance or
impair the general welfare ; above all to make
them intelligent and strong leaders, not ser-
vile and ill-informed followers of public opi-
nion or selfish beneficiaries of popular delu-
sions,

This is not only to advance the cause of
high education but the cause of free govern-
ment, by helping to retain and to prepare for
the service of the country that “better mind
which is said to be growing more and more
alienated from the highest of all sciences and
services the government of it.” For such edu-
cation the examples and inspirations are all
around us ; nowhere more than in the past his-
tory of this commonwealth, or in the names
associated with the origin and past history of
this school.

We throw away the richest part of our en-
dowment if we do not bring these examples
and inspirations to the education of our young
men; if we do not mould into their very sta-
mina the patriotic princples of those fathers
and those founders and those illustrous peo-
ple or the past, and such loyalty to those prin-
ciples as will not barter or surrender them
to any ambition for personal advancement or
to any fear of personal consequence. They

need to learn that it is harder to preserve
freedom in peace than it is to win freedom in
war ; that it is as disloyal and as shameful to
falter or desert in the one struggle as in the
other; and that it may require a courage as
high and thoughtless of self as that which
nerved William Campbell and his fellow stu-
dents of a century ago to scale the slopes of
King’s mountain,

Neither can we pass over to others, no
matter how fair and honest they may be, the
task of writing our own local history ; of vin-
dicating and establishing the just credit and
contribution of our state and our section to
the achievement of American independence,
to the founding of our constitutional govern-
ment, to the expansion of our territory or to
the past greatness and glory of our Union.
Still less can we pass over to others, however
patriotic and capable they may be, any share
of our own part in the task and duty and the
abiding honor of governing our common
country, of perpetuating its freedom, of pro-
moting its prosperity.

Our youth must have the same educational
training as the youth of other parts of the
country to fit them for leadership, a leader-
ship based upon the broadest, most enlighten-
ed and American statesmanship, and in this
training Washington and Lee University is
called upon to take no minor part among the
schools of the South and of our beloved
country.

And now, Mr. Rector, I have taken the
oath which the statutes of this college require
you to administer to its president elect. I have
taken it with no reservations and with no illu-
sions, but as stated in my formal letter of ac-
ceptance, with the lesson learned in the hard
school of life, that no great duty can be met
without great effort, patience and singleness
of purpose. These I hope to bring to the of-
fice to which the trustees have called me. |
know that by this oath I take my place in a
line illustrated in the past century and a half
by great abilities and great virtues. To recall
with discriminating praise all who have pre-
sided over this University is a task for which
I am not competent. To mention some would
be invidious, but there is one name which
stands out on the roll of the world’s greatest
men as the symbol of the highest virtue and
most perfect manhood that human nature
has ever attained. The inspiration of that
name and the memory of his lofty character
will always linger as a noble educational in-
fluence around this college, revived and per-
petuated as they have been in recent years
by his worth son. No man deserving of your
choice could assume in any vain or self-suffici-
ent spirit the leadership of an institution en-
dowed by George Washington and once ad-
ministered by Robert E. Lee.

Football Cuts...

Old jinxes never die, it seems. At
Washington and Lee, the knee in-
jury jinx keeps striking the football
captains. Three years ago, it was
punter Rudd Smith, wiped out at
mid-season. The next year, both co-
captains, John Wolf and Scott Mac-
kenzie, finished the year on crutches.
Last year, center Michael (Thunder)
Thornton missed most of the season
with a banged-up knee. And last
week the jinx struck again as co-
captain and linebacker Drew Kum-
puris injured his knee in a serim-
mage. Kumpuris, one of the Gen-

erals’ leading tacklers last year, will
be out for at least six weeks.

Several other injuries have ham-
pered the Generals in pre-season
practice. Defensive back Ray Coates
broke his arm and will miss at least
the first four games, and promising
freshman lineman Johnny Sorrells
of Lexington will be out indefinitely
following a hernia operation.

The 1970 Generals will have a
distinct local flavor, with no less
than six boys from the Lexington
area on the squad. That's more than
anyone can remember in recent
years. Three are former players for
Lexington High School: scatback
lohnny Sheridan, lineman Johnny
Sorrells and kicking specialist Doug
Chase Jr. Three others are sons of
WAL faculty and staff members: de-
fensive safety Marshall Washburn,
defensive end Graham (Bucky) Les-
lie 11 (son of head coach Buck Les-
lie Jr.) and fullback Jim Farrar Jr.
Washburn and Leslie are sopho-
mores. the others freshmen. All are
expected to see a lot of action, Wash-
burn as a starter.

Neer

Continiutes
Stardom

“Want to sign a contract to play
professional ball this year in Italy?”
Basketball star Mike Neer said yes.

Neer, a 6-7 center who graduated
in June, will leave next week for
Bologna, where he will be the only
American on the Bologna team
which competes in a 12-team Euro-
pean professional league.

“I’m really excited about it,”
Neer commented from his Alexand-
ria, Va. home. “I’m real happy to be
getting a chance to play professional
basketball, and financially, it will be
super. Besides, it ought to be a lot of
fun,”

Neer was recommended for the
Italian pro league by Bob Cousy and
the general manager of the Cincinn-
ati Royals, Joe Alexson. Neer made
an impressive showing while attend-
ing the Royals’ rookie tryout camp
conducted by Cousy this summer ia
New Hampshire. Scouts from the
Italian league first saw him there
and were impressed.

“Mike looked real good and show-
ed a lot of promise,” Alexson said
from the Royals’ front office in Cin-
cinnati. “But we felt the transition
to forward in the NBA would be
just too much for him at the present
time.”

Alexson indicated that with some
professional experience behind him,
Neer might make the grade in the
NBA. Neer played center for W&L
and admittedly must work on his
outside shooting to play forward.

“The ltalian scouts were impress-
ed with my jumping abiilty,” said

Mike Neer

now a pro

Neer, “In the Italian league, it’s
legal to block shots above the rim
and to stuff the ball.”

Several current professional stars
have played in the Italian League,
including Bill Bradley while a
Rhodes Scholar in England, Terry
Driscoll and Doug Moe. Driscoll,
now with the Boston Celtics, was the
American player on the Bologna
team last year.

“Driscoll told me it was really a
great deal,” Neer said. “The Ameri-
cans are treated as real celebrities in
the towns where they play.”

But they also can get the equiva-
lent of the Italian bum’s rush, “At
the end of the year,” Neer said, “the
two last-place teams are demoied to
the minor leagues and the two best
minor league teams move up. If you
finish last or next-to-last, they run
you out of town.”

Football Team Meets
E&H On Saturday

The 1970 Washington and Lee
Varsity Football team opens the
season Saturday on Wilson Field as
the Generals play host to a rugged
Emory and Henry squad.

The Generals will be relying upon
the superior speed and quickness of
their interior linemen to overcome
the always mammoth Emory and
Henry defensive line which averages
220 pounds. Tackles Steve Hannon
(190) and John MeNeil (210) and
guards Andy Smith (170) and Cap-
tain Stamen Ogilvie (188) provide
the experience in W&L’s offensive
line.

Sophs Tom Van Amburgh and
Steve Fluharty are trying for the
starting quarterback role while hard
running JoJo Martin fills the full-
back slot. Bill Wallace, a 6-1’ 175
pound freshman could get the nod
at halfback come game time.

Bruce Green, an Associated Press
all-state selection last year, returns
at flankerback. Green’s 25 pass re-
ceptions last year also netted him a
spot on the 1969 all CAC team.
Steve “Chief” Mahaffey returned to
Washington and Lee again this year
to complete his final year of gridiron
eligibility. Mahaffey pulled in 33
passes last season for 371 yards and
3 TD's.

Defensively, the Generals can
count on Scott Neese, (205) and

Dave Laughlin (200) at the tackles,
while Al McWhorter (200) and Mike
O'Donnell (195) hold down the end
positions.

The linebacking corps of George
Harris, Frank Evans, Tim Haley and
Ken Carter, is potentially one of the
finest in the south. Co-captain and

linebacker Drew Kumpuris has been
sidelined by a knee injury which
will keep him out of action.

All state selection Dave Brooks
heads the defensive secondary,
Brooks rewrote the record books

last year when he picked one off
against Washington and raced 101
yards for a touchdown in Busch
Stadium. The other veteran in the
secondary is soph Marshall Wash-
burn who will be counted on to
combat Emory and Henry’s aerial
game.

rhe last time Emory and Henry
came to Wilson Field they snapped
a 21 game General winning streak,
Their man to watch is number 38,
Wayne Neese, a Little All-American
fullback who last year wrecked
enemy defenses as he became one of
the south’s leading rushers.

Saturday's game could easily de-
cide the mythical small college state
championship since both W&L and
Emory and Henry are the pre-season
picks to top the rankings. Kick off
time is 2:00 for what should prove
to be a good game.

Next week—Towson State.
