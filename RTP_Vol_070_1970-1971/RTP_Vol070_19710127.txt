On Convention

By TOM MAYS
Sophomore EC

Since September of th's academic
year, significant improvement has
been made in our student govern-
ment, it is surprising that we have
come up with such a progressive
form as the University Council.

Why is the University Counc’l
such a worthwhile innovation? Some
might conjecture that it will give
students more substantial power, or
that students will finally take their
rightful place in the decision-mak'ng
processes. But more than these the
Un‘versity Council will most assur-
edly provide a point from whic
faculty, students and administrators
may develop new ways of working
together to solve crisis as well as the
long-term problems facing the Uni-
versity.

The key to the eventual success cf :

the U.C. as an ideal structure of
“community” government, may be
found within the relationship be-
tween faculty and students. Gen-
erally speaking, one must admit that
each indivi has his own source
of experience which provides him
with usable data.

One might hypothesize that the
most valuable relationships an indi-
vidual is able to have are those here
he is giving of his store of data as
well as receiving.

lt is unfortunate that the relation-
ship between faculty and students is
often one in which the data goes
all one way. The lecturer gives and
the listener receives, and although
there are exceptions, rarely does the
situation reverse or attain an equili-
brium.

The importance of this relation-
ship does not only concern academic
matters. We cannot expect that tra-
ditional relationship such as this
w'll disappear just because it is po'nt-
ed out. But through such means as
the U.C. and the participation of
students on faculty committees a
mutual trust and understanding
should develop and the barrier to
fuller cooperation between facu'ty
and students should be surmounted.

Such a movement would of course
be beneficial academically. lt would
tlso be a great step in the right
rection for those who envision tha’
in the next few years “student gov-
ernmem” and thus “faculty com-
mittees” will combine their in‘ores!
in favor of a “community govern-
mem.”

This is certainly an idealistic pros-
pect. And with our present form of
governmmem the evolution to suc) 4
state would be ardurous if not im-
possible. There are too many s'ruc-
tures at presem that tend to inhibt
new ideas from growing and wh'ch
from year to year only perpetunte
themselves and remain complacent

Thus the Exeoutive Commitice in
order to shed some of the anachron-
isms that bind it, to achieve maxi-
mum input of ideas from the stu-
dent body and to gather community
opinion, has called a Constitutional
Convention to be held in February
on the weekend of Friday, February
12, 1971.

Delegates to the Convention wll
he selected at-large from the stuton
body. Anyone desiring to attend the
convention as a delegate should
register himself with Student Body
Secretary Rich and then pow hs
potition on a bulletin board that wil!
be in the Co-ap. Twenty exclusive
undergraduate signatures will be
necessary. A Rules Commitice select
ed by the E.C. will draw up pro
cedures beforehand and the dele
gutes will vote upon these when they
convene. Delegates from the Law
School will be chosen by a means
determined by their Board of Gov
ernors

It may seem inoredible, but w
before us an Opportunity to
crewte an entirely new and
respomsiev form of government, In
this type of convention we will be
sble to review the weaknewes of th
presem system and hopefully bu id
a new government that wil be able

presem system amd contend with tre
ever-changing needs of our
rrvupnet y

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, JANUARY 27, 1971

 

IFC President Doug Gossmann
Cooperative, Rush
Examined By IFC

The Interfraternity Council meet-
ing Tuesday night considered several
topics Which members said were of
mportance to the W&L student
body.

Among the subjects acted upon
was a proposal by members of the
University Center Committee that
the UCC, the IFC and the Dance
Board join in supporting and run-
ning a dance on Feb. 19, the night
before the Feb. 20 concert, to make
two big weekends that month.

The proposal was based on the
assumption that the three organiza-
tions would have an equal share in
the cost and management of the
dance, to be held in Evans Dining
Hall, with beer concessions and
other facilities to be arranged later.

Members of the UCC reported
that the proposal had been under
consideration by that group for some
time, and had been mentioned to
both the IFC and the Dance Board
previously.

Last night's action was seen as the
culmination of several weeks’ of
attempting to find a replacement for
Fancy Dress without actually re
viving the ball itself.

The motion passed the IFC, and
plans on the dance are being drawn
up.

Another item brought up befor:
the IFC last night concerned the
food cooperative which was forme!
ths past semester. The lack of suc-
cess in this attempt was the subjec*
of a new report which was presented
to the members of the body

A new cooperative is being con
idered, but, if attempted, it is no
expected to be of the same size a
he first one. New prices and de
l.very methods are being looked in’

is planned for Thursday at 7 p.m.

“It will be an open session, and
all fraternity men are invited,” they
said. “We hope that they will come
and air complaints they have with
the rush system of last semester, and
propese changes and alternatives.”

Members of the IFC have made
no secret of the fact that they were
‘opleased with the way rush went
‘is year. Many felt that the rush
period dragged on excessively, and
hat freshmen as well as upperclass-
men were bored with the long dura-
tion.

Another point mentioned in con-
nection with rush was the confusion
which many houses had over the
exact rules governing rush, several
of which were altered midway
through the period this year.

In other action before the IFC
last night, the Sigma Phi Epsilon
fraternity announced to Gossman
that the members had decided to
withdraw from that organization.

Reasons cited were a disillusion
ment with the IFC, based on the
SPE's exclusion from the IFC sum-
mer rush booklet, the rush date
cards, and the student directory, as
well as financial considerations
which made IFC dues an unneces-
sary expense.

A Consiiutional Convention will
convene Feb. 12 to propose a new
Washington and Lee student body
constitution. In its Monday night
meeting, the Executive Oommittee
passed a motion (9-1, Craig Jones
opposing) calling for:

extend to Feb. 11 and 12 as neces-

sary) at 1:00 p.m. in Evans Dining

Hall;

Class of ’73
Makes $200
Contribution

Last Thursday the sophomore class
council headed by President Rick
Grey voted to donate $200 of the
surplus class funds to a local cloth-
ing drive for school age children.
The drive was initiated last fall by
members of the Rockbridge County
Welfare Rights Organization and was
directed by local TAP (Total Action
Against Poverty) and VISTA offici-
als,

Lois Walker, local TAP commun-
ity worker, stated that the drive was
origninated because of the lack of
Federal Title 1 funds, funds with
are ordinarily used to purchase
school clothes for needy children,
appropriated for Rockbridge County.
As a result, many county children
lacked adequate winter clothing. The
drive could not be completed, how-
ever, due to the lack of donations
of both clothing and money.

Last month the Bureau of Cathe’.
Charities donated $100 to the drive
and that coupled with the W&L
contribution, enabled the drive to be
a success. In addition to these funds,
soveral of the Lexington churches
also contributed clothes and money
to the drive. Two W&L students,
Robert Lewis and John Brymesser,
also made generous personal con-
tr butions. Two other students, Kurt
Krumperman and Mike Peck asssist-
ed in the running of the drive.

Cocktail Party
Will Be Held

Saturday, February 6th marks the
60th anniversary of Fancy Dress
Weekend. To commemorate this oc-
casion the Dance Board has done
away with the Fancy Dress Ball,
but kept the cocktail party. The
party will be held at Zollman’s Pa-
vilion from 2 to 5:30. Music will be
provided by the Eye. Reports from
the Fancy Dress high command say
that the drink served will be a bour-
bon mix. If it should run out (and
there is a good chance) provisions
will be made to handle BYOL.

2) Delegates to the convention
will be selected in the undergradu-
ate school based on a petition of
25 exclusive undergrad signatures,
and in the law school 5 delegates
selected by a method devised by

the Board of Governors. The Ex-
ecutive Committee will be voting
members of the convention.

3) Rules of procedure will be

drawn up by the EC, the Consti-
“utional Sub Committee, and ap-
proved by the delegates to the
convention at the beginning of the
session. (The convention delegates
will adopt necessary rules con-
cerning adjournment, recess, etc.)
Signature lists and other convention
information will be posted at the
Co-op Monday-Thursday of next
week.

Russ Fletcher was seleoted as the
new Freshman EC representative in
a lengthy Exeoutive Session prior to
the meeting.

Other business included discussion

 

of a system for faculty evaluation
and a report from Henry Harkey
concerning the Student Financial
Relations Committee.

Harkey reported a drastic increase
in cold checks passed by W&L stu-
denis in this academic year. $1786
in checks have been covered by
Financial Relations thus far ($616
just prior to Christmas), Chairman
Harkey voiced the hope that this in-
crease would not seriously jeapordize
the student check cashing priviliges
in Lexington and asked the EC for
suggestion to curb the problem,

Harkey expressed his feelings that
“the solution is not heavier fining
for these offenses, but better com-
munications.” The EC recommended
signs for the cash registers of local
merchants, but decided to defer any
drastic action until the Spring term.
It wa salso noted that the Financial
Relations Committee may have to

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

January 27, 1971

A Lesson In Identifying
A Splattered Tomato

This is getting ridiculous. We apologize to our readers
for this continuing series in editorials over the R.O.T.C. con-
troversy, but Mr. Swart's letter appearing in today’s issue has
provoked what will have to be a rather lengthy repetition of
what we tried to state succinctly in our inaugural attempt.

Mr. Swart is anxious to point out our responsibility in
arguing the issue of R.O.T.C. on Mr. Newman's terms. May
we remind Mr. Swart that he has a responsibility also?

Both he and Mr. Newman are intent on insisting that the
issue at stake is the “academic worth” of the R.O.T.C. pro-
gram, Think now. How is academic worth defined? If your
answer to that question is “it is defined by whether or not a
course relates to the body of knowledge which an institution
is in the perpetual business of exploring,” then you may read
on. If you've come up with a different answer from that, then
our ultimate definitions of academic worth are not the same,
and there's no point in pursuit of any further discussion.

Our editorial of two weeks ago was a discussion of the real
issue: “relevancy” of R.O.T.C. in the W&L curriculum. Mr.
Swart and Mr. Newman's terms of “academic worth” is, as
far as we can ascertain, a lot of hollow rhetoric which is mask-
ing their real complaint about the presence of R.( ).T.C. as an
academic program at W&L.

So, the issue is not relevancy but “academic worth?” In
answer to Mr. Newman's “lucid and knowledgeable argu-
ment” in last week's newspaper, he puts forth two rhetorical
questions which are proof enough for us that the phrase “aca-
demic worth” stinks of the popular cry of “relevancy” just
as much as if Mr. Newman had attempted to convince us
that someone had splashed red paint against a wall when in
reality someone had splattered an overripe tomato.

We quote: “How do marksmanship, map reading, small
unit tactics communications, military courtesy and drill strike
you as academic subjects? Is that the kind of thing the school
gives credit for?” No, Mr. Newman, don't try to make a simple
issue complicated by saying you're not questioning its rel-
evancy and that what we were concerned with was a “trivial
sidelight.” This is the most pompous proclaimation we've read
in a long time.

Then we come to Mr. Newman's “in all fairness” paragraph
in which he isn’t being fair at all. Don't you think the geology
department at W&L would be somewhat upset if they knew
you thought that any instruction in map reading was “voca-
tional?” What about other courses at W&L which encourage
students into activities of a vocational nature, such as the
stagecraft course at the theatre or the sculpture courses?
Academic credit is given for these courses; what's the dif-
ference? The difference is not in the work, but in the relation-
ship of the student to the work,

As we stated in our first editorial, the issue still remains
whether or not a student should sign up for the R.O,T.C.
program. If he does, then it’s just like signing up for any
other major—there are courses he's required to take. Mr. New-
man finds the cadets in the corps as being reluctant to losing
the credit in these courses because of sentiment such as “Why
lose an easy A?” We know of one student who didn’t make
the popular Dean's List last semester because of the grade he
received in his R.O.T.C. courses. The question of R.O.T.C.
being an advantage to one’s GPR seems to us to be moot at
best,

As for making one’s course load lighter, Mr. Newman has
disproved that statement in part because of this comment:
“Il put over five hours a week into those classes.” A lot of
work, And doesn't he take four courses at three hours credit
apiece? Even if he doesn't, five hours of work a week for two

hours’ credit for the term seems pretty fair to us.

Finally the conclusion of Mr. Newman's not “totally un-
qualified” assessment of the relevancy of R.O.T.C. is the fact
that the army chooses its own instructors just as the depart
ment heads at W&L do. What do you know? Of course, here
at W&L, the with the administration, in
K.O.T.C. as well as with the other departments, but the de

final say rests
partment head is the man who handpicks instructors in his
Is Mr. Newman suggesting an alternative? Is there
a logical one? Why shouldn't the army select its own men to

own field

teach? Should the philosophy department pick them?

We see this whole mini-crisis as an attempt by Mr
man, Mr

New
Swart, et al to attack a set of courses which thes
don't like and which they feel that they can eliminate from the
catalogue by means of rhetorical window shopping. Behind
all those words is the plain and simple fact that they don't
like R.O.T.C, A subjective point of view which this editor
shares with them

But on a campus which in the past few years has grown
much more “liberal” than it used to be, doesn't it seem odd that
there are fewer people willing to allow some students have an
opportunity to take what they want to take? Indeed, people
aware that R.O.T 4
tudents to attend

scholarships make it possible for some

school here? Toleration, where hast thou

flown ?

A Few Objective Facts For
The Current ROTC Question

By SKIP PAUKERT

The issue of whether or not R.O.
T.C. courses deserve academic credit
has evidently arrived at W&L, and
it seems likely that the resulting
polemical furor might have settled
in for a few weeks.

Of course, any question that in-
volves the presence of the United
States Army on the campus now is
bound to fill the editor's box with
letters. But some would say that to
pass off a real look at the issue be-
cause of its national context is un-
fair—and they would probably be
right.

So this week The Ring-tum Phi
has attempted to obtain some facts
to help us all to make an appraisal
of the question as it pertains to
this campus. Several questions have
been raised deserving exploration.

The basic fact is that the univer-
sity has signed a contract with the
Department of the Army providing
for the maintenance of a Reserve
Officer Training Unit on this campus.
The unit comes to the college upon
invitation by the college.

The stipulation included in the
contract requires the university to
assign some credit to the courses
offered ‘by the Military Science de-
partmem. The amount of that credit
is solely determined by the Com-
mittee of Courses and Degrees.

“We accept whatever the Com-
mittee thinks is a fair slice,” sad
Col. Jack Morris, head of the M/i-
tary Science department. “My job
is to see that we do have the utmost
academic quality in our courses.”

It was also suggested in one letier
hast week that the Army “chooses the
faculty.” This, however, is not
exactly true. The Army does nomi-
nate men to serve as R.O.T.C. in-
structors, but they must be inter-
viewed and hired by wunivers'y
officials under the normal procedure.

Candidates for instructor are col-
lege graduates, with oredit from
Command and General Staff Col-
leges, plus two year’s duty as an
assistam professor.

Once to this point, several factors
enter to complicate the matter of
academic creda for a military pro-
gram. The question is basically this:
(a) Is the content of such courses
iwtellectually challenging and/or
practically useful to merit university

credit? And (b) if the military pro-
gram were relegated to the status
of an extra-curricular activity, would
there be a severe drop in enroll-
ment?

Let us take the ROTC course of
study out of context, and question its
academic merit. How is this possibly
determined objectively?

“We think our courses go hand-
in-glove with other courses, to en-
able students to learn to think ra-
tionally, logically, in dealing wth
human relationships,” offered Col.
Morris. “Take a sampling of the
things that a future officer might be
taught: management of materiels,
techniques of business transaction,
procurement, leadership. He is ex-
pected to use good judgment, and
have the normal character qualities
for responsibility. We want our stu-
denis to be able to apply what they
learn.”

Along with the marksmanship
and drill, a R.O.T.C. student is in-
sructed in map reading, military
history, land navigation, military
justice, and Organization and Opera-
tions, And these courses don't seem
to be feasibly susceptible to course
isolation.

Efforts have been made to estab-
lish cooperative map reading pro-
grams between the Military So'en::
and Geology departments. And after
the R.O.T.C. schedule is adjusted to
the new curriculum, it is hoped that
further changes can bring the R.O.
'.C. department up out of the ravine
academically.

At present the R.O.T.C. program
carries a total of 11 credits for four
years. A senior who puts in five
hours a week gets two credits for
the term.

Col. Morris expressed the dilem-
ma faced by the R.O.T.C. faculty.
“We do not offer a major in our
course, and, therefore, can't take
up too much of the student's time.
We must maintain that balance be-
tween offering an academic chal-
lenge and still not taking up an ex-
cessive number of his hours.”

The matter, then, proceeds to 4
central question: if credit were re-
moved would it jeopardize the unit's
existence?

“We have no crystal ball,” said
Morris, “but I think I can say that
it would have an adverse effect.”

Olson Examines
Courses Group

By DAVID OLSON

Phe state of the Curricutum Com-
muttee’s report to the faculty about
the option for Juniors and Seniors to
take the'r courses Pass/Fa:l is now
in question, Lex McMillan said that
the report was rewritien by him but
that at this point it did mot have “a
snowball’s chance in hell” of passs-
ing the faculty. He felt that the
faculty just would not buy it. He
aso made the point that the facu!y
was reticent about any change at ths
o.nt because they want to clear up
the problems with 12-12-6 before
embarking on any new change.

When asked about the state of
12-12-6 at this point McMillan said
that he guessed that “more than half”
of the faculty was against the system
bu: that the spring term would be
the crucial period. “We oan’t treat
it like a vacation,” he said.

MeMillan was also displeased
with the attitude of the faculty. He
feels that they change some things
and think they have given us great
advances. He pointed out that the
faculty is reluctant to embark on
any real changes that might change
che texture of tthe school.

1 can not help ‘but sympathize
with the plight of the Ourriculum
Committee. They have no power,
operate in a vacuum, and thus they
must continually be frustrated. The
Pass/Fail is a viable option for stu-
dents who do not plan to go on to
graduate school. It seems, that the
necessity of grades is only a neces-
sity in relation to graduate schools.
If this is to be one’s last institutional
educative exeprience there seems to
be little need for grades.

In relation to the new calender
there seems to be quite a bit of
faculty displeasure with the set-up.
I can only agree with Lex McMillan
that the spring will indeed be the
crucial period and that no faculty
member or student can honestly

View Exchange Program

By DOUG BURTON

At a time when unisexual uni-
versies are considered perverseies
by advocates of coeducation, the
male-female exchange program has
found a place for itself at WAL.
Two W&L students are now at Hol-
lins College: a third has just re-
turned, and though the initial re-
ports of the program's success are
good, yet there are some kinks.

The program's avowed purpose
stated in a WAL brochure is “to
broaden the educational opportun
ties of the students in the cight
participating colleges; to provide a
diverse campus environment for the
students visiting other campuses and
for the students who remar on their
own cimpuses, and to be an initial
limited experiment in cooperative
vencures among these cight colleges,
possibly leading to more extensive
programs in the future

Dean Watt told The Ring4um

Apperance of Drugs

Through A Spyglass Darkly .. .

By JEFFREY B. SPENCE

This campus has all sorts of
people who care about the world
around them. The problem is that
when it comes to worrying about
right here at W&L it seems like no
one gives a damn, For example,
take a close look at our campus. li
is beginning to look like a maze of
meandering mud ruts. About two
months ago Fran Lawrence ran up
a warning flag to the student body
concerning the appearence of our
campus, apparently his warning went
unheaded.

One © fthe most beautiful campus-
es in America is taking a beating be-
cause our concerned students have
their heads so high in the clouds
ithat they can not seem to find the
walkways that are converiently
located all across the university. One
wonders why their heads are so high
in the clouds. Well, the wonaering
doesn't last long. You can travel to
almost any college surrounding us
and they wil Itell you that We&L is
the main outlet for drugs in these
parts. What do they know anyway?
Who cares what they say? They
don’t even go to schoul nere how
coul dthey know?

It is safe to assume ‘that those cut-
siders don't have all the facts; but
there must be some reason why they
would carry tales like some of the
ones that are going around places
like R-MWC, No, we are not the
main outlet for anyone except may-
be ourselves, With all the flap about
R.O.T.C., traditional dress, Love
Story, and local civil suits, it seems
like someone might pay some atten-
tion to ithe fastest rising problem on
this campus,

Those of you who are in the drug
scene might control your supercili-
ousness for just a minute. Although
it isn't widely known we have al-
ready had to hospitalize students
from W&L who thought they knew
all about the use of drugs. They
were not basically unintelligent stu-
dents, but they were stupid. Stupid
enough at least to believe that if
one is hip and has done some dope
that he can handle anything. Obvi-
ously there are a few who can’t.

Pot smoking isn’t the problem so
throwing some students out of the
dorms for doing it is useless; except
to clear our collective conscience
that we are attacking the rising use

of drugs. The problem is found
with the use of chemicals and hard
dope. There has been some talk
around W&L that a center similar
to Roanoke’s TRUST center is being
planned. It is an excellent idea, as
far as it goes. This center will cer-
tainly help those experiencing a buin
trip, but what does it do to prevent
the problem from starting?

It is imperative to repeat here that
Pot is not the problem. Not every,
not even a majority of students who
use it go on to higher stuff, any
more than does tthe average drinking
man here become an alcoholic. How-
ever it seems that if we are truly con-
cerned about our fellow students and
the university as a whole we might
get into something that vill offer
us not just information aout, but
constructive alternatives: to, those
who feel they must use potentially
destructive chemicals on their bodies.
Raise hell about something worth-
while for once! Peace.

 

Dean of Students Lewis G. John is one of several administrators respon-
sible for the exchange programs involving W&L. (see story page 2).

By MACK WOODWARD

I was reminded the other day that
there were many people my age who
were out “in the world,” mot in a
sheltered university community. One
is constantly reminded that there “is
a world going out there”; indeed,
there is a world “out there,” a world
in Which children starve and people
kill. But there is also a world in
here, a world in which people are
starving for lack of communication
and thoughts are being killed by
hollow rhetoric.

I cannot help being a bit amazed
iby those who are so anxious io point
to the “real world.” This is the real
world—or so I have thought, but
perhaps my mind is noi suitably ex-
panded—as much as anything else
that lies outside the 60 miles radius;
this is the world in which we live. I
have always believed that one should
be more concerned with the wrold
in which one lives, until one has oon-
trol over it.

Letters Discuss ROTC Question

Dove on Freedom
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Academic freedom has recently
been used as a justification for giv-
ing R.O.T.C. courses academic
oredit. What is academic freedom?

Many R.O.T.C. students feel that
their behavior is restricted because
of their participation in the R.O.T.C.
program. Many R.O.T.C. students
complain that they cannot wear their
hair as they wish. Many R.O.T.C.
students do not feel that they can
participate in anti-war demonstra-
tions. Many R.O.T.C, students do
not feel that they can write letters
to The Ring-tum Phi criticizing the
army, the war, the draft, or R.O.T.C.
Many R.O.T.C. students allege that
files are kept on their ‘behavior in
and outside of the classroom. In
short many R.O.T.C. students do not
feel that they have much “academic
freedom.”

The R.O.T.C. department is un-
like any of the other departments at
our school. In order to take one
course in military science, one has
to sign up for a whole program of

of the campus the students are en-

R.O.T.C. faculty is not controlled
in any way by Washington and Lee
University. Yet their instructors can
voie in faculty meetings.

The R.O.T.C, faculty is not hired

of the faculty. The R.O.T.C. faculty
is pushing a career on us as no
other department on this campus is.
It would seem that U.S. Steel should
be permitted to settle on the campus
to mold exeoutives if the army is
permitted to mold officers.

To give academic oredit to a de-
partment in which there seems to be
little “academic freedom” seems to
be contrary to the purposes of a
liberal arts institution such as Wash-

_ington and Lee.

Gingold on “Facts”
To the Editor of ‘The Ring-tum Phi:

OK. You are saying that you've
got the right to editorial opinion,
and I'm saying yeah, but it would
be a good idea if you had some
factual basis for forming your opin-
ions. By factual, I'm trying to get
at HONEST—that is to say, opinions
based upon first hand information
from BOTH SIDES—which you
know you did not have.

As for winning an argument, you
also know that one man’s editorial
opimon in any newspaper is guing
to have greater influence than any
man’s opinion. So, what i'm getting
wt here is that you have a responsi-
bility to the people who pay for
that paper that has been used «as
YOUR paper. Why don't you just
say that the editorial you wrote
about ROTC was your own one-
sided, slanted, second or third per-
son viewpoim. But don't give us that
“the opinion of the PHI" rebop.

I can't condemn you for your
opinion especially when | know that
you didn't get the facts from all the
sides. But I can wonder just where
you got the idea that you can turn
a school paper into a personal piece
of inferior journalism, If you need
direction on how to do a really fine

job, all you have to do is go up-
stairs a flight or two and speak to
Hugh Hill and the folks at the
school radio station. Until then, and
us hong as you keep up with that
diddley, I’m gonna keep right on
sending you nasty letters.
Jeff Gingold

Swart defends Newman
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

I would like to comment on your
recent editorial: “For Your Informa-
tion, Sirs...” Which seems to be a
reply to the letters of Jeff Gingold
and Everett Newman. Your petulant
reaction to Mr. Gingold’s letter ap-
pears to have clouded your judg-
ment where Mr. Newman is con-
cerned,

In your first paragraph you say,
“Oddly enough, two writers of let-
ters to the newspaper this week seem
appalled that these columns are re-
served for our editorial opinion.”
Wrong. Nowhere in Mr. Newman's
letter is there any remark which
questions your right to state your
edtiorial opinion in your editorial
colunyn; there is merely disagree-
mem with your opinion on this
issue.

Now to the “cheapest short cuts
in winning an argument.” (a) If you
“claim that your opposition is not
presenting ‘the facts’ on your side
and therefore not credible,” you are
taking a cheap short cut. But if you
presem facts, which the opposition
has failed to present or presented
falsely, so that an impartial observer
may judge their merit, you are re-
futing the argument of the opposi-
tion. I'm afraid Mr. Newman has
you there. I read nothing in the peti-
tion about asking for votes on
courses relevancy, ending the Veit
Nam War, or excluding people from
continuing in R.O.T.C., as stated in
your original editorial. It seems as
if someone other that Mr. Newman
is taking a “cheap short cut.”

(b) Mr. Newman does not “pomp-
ously prockim” anything. He simply
says outright that you “set up false
issues and then proceed to demolish
them,” and then cites facts in a
rather good argument to establish
that this is so. If you do not agree
that what he says # true, then refute

his argument with facts, rather than
dismissing him as a “pompous pro-
claimer.”

I had not previously formed an
opinion on the R.O.T.C. issue, but
Mr. Newman thas presented a lucid
and knowledgeable argument for re-
viewing R.O.T.C.’s academic worth.
You have not answered his argu-
ment. You have dismissed him for
challenging your editorial rights,
which he did not in fact do. You
have misstated his methods and mo-
tives, then attacked them, all the
While ignoring his argument. This is
the cheapest short out for winning
any argument. I challenge you to
refute factually Mr. Newman's argu-
ment, as stated in this letter, point
by point. I ‘believe it is your edi-
torial responsibility (every right car-
ries @ responsibility) to do so.

Peter Swart

Colvin on Ecology

To the Editor of The Ring4um Phi:

As a result, perhaps, of the
Contact Program or just a general
quickening of public interest in en-
vironmental problems, some students
have come to me and asked how
they can personally participate in the
fight to save nature from the dispoila-
tions of man.

Two quick suggestions: $7.50 is
the price of membership in the
“Wilderness Society” which brings
with it regular mailings of Wilder-
ness Reports and conservation alerts,
or for $17 one can join the “Sierra
Club,” in my opinion, the most active
fighting outfit in the conservation
cause. Both organizations are eager
to tell you how to effectively partici-
pate in getting things done or getting
things stopped. Both provide an up-
to-date report on all conservation
issues before Congress and before
State legishatures.

lous and insensitive (after hysterical,
however, everything willl be anti-
climactic) for questioning the pre-

vailing order of priorities, but
how can one set out to make
the world wonderful ( or safe

for democracy or whatever) without
first making one’s own surroundings
more liveable? I do not deny that
there is need for food in Pakistan,
‘but there is also a lot that needs
to be done here—in Lexington, Vir-

notion that one’s resources are better
used in tending to the needs of one’s
own circumstance; we must cultivate

our garden.

Our garden cannot be cultivated
until we, as gardeners, decide what
we are going to plant in the garden.
And we cannot decide what we are
going to plant until we can com-
municate in an orderly fashion
among ourselves. If we all continue
to consider each other's opinions as
equally imvalid, we shall never be
able to decide upon hew our garden
grows. But we cannot even consider
one another's opinions when, for the
most part, they are totally ubscured
by meaningless catch phrases.

Until we disencumber our thoughts
of trite epithets, we shall be for-
ever caviling about the definition of
a weed, and not how we are going
to get them out of the garden. Per-
haps the situation is hopeless;
perhaps many of our woull-be

gardeners are in fact, the weeds
choking our garden.

With wrestling season half over,
the Washington and Lee wrestling
team is looking for more successes
in future matches than ‘they have had
in previous ones. Due to tough
competition and sickness on the
WA&L team, the Generals have won
only one meet, against Guilford,
while suffering four losses, to Duke,

Generals Win on The Road

By PALMER TRICE

This past week was perhaps the
most crucial of the Washington and
Lee basketball season. The Generals
‘ook to the road for two big bali
games, one with Johns Hopkins, and
the other with Davis and Elkins.
While the squad did not play its best
game of the season, it played well
enough to win, and did win both

games.

The first encounter was with John
Hopkins. Led by Paul McClure’s 16
points and 15 rebounds, the Blue
marched to a 72-62 victory. Mike
Daniel had a season high of 6 assists.
For the game, the Generals shot a
torrid 52 percent from the floor.
They also used a height advantage
to dominate the boards. This ad-
vantage has been a rarely seen one
this season, and the visitors made
the most of it. The offense, which
has lacked a punch, looked better in
spots.

When Coach Canfield traveted to
Davis and Elkins, he knew that his
team would be facing a real run and
shoot team. He was right. The home
team took 91 shots (that’s no mis-
print). This was in spite of the fact

that the Generals enjoyed a 63-45
rebound advantage. In a fan-pleasing
exhibition Davis and Elkins ‘took
shots from everywhere. Some of the
26 that they made were absolutely
incredible. Still the percentage was a
mere 29 per cent. The Generals
made six less field goals, but hit
seventeen more foul tries. The score
was 66-61. Defensively, the Generals
showed a man for man, a match-up,
and a half court zone press. The
victory raised the record of the W&L
roundballers to 9-4,

Wednesday night, the Generals
play Pembroke State. For those of
you that have never heard of Pem-

‘broke, it is located in Pembroke,

North Carolina. Their record thus
far is 10-5. Their front line features
three men over 6'4”. Remember, the
Generals are 52-7 at Doremus.
Hats off this week to Skip Litcht-
fuss. He came off the bench in the
Davis and Elkins and garnered 10
points and 13 rebounds .... For the
season, Mike Daniel is averaging
17.6 points a game .... Dave Stone
follows with 10.6 per game .. . For
the year, the Generals are averag-
ing 68.5 points per game, as com-
pared with 65.8 for their opponents.

The big game of the week, and,
perhaps, of the year, wil ltake place
at University Hall on February 2,
when our Generals take on the 19th
ranked Cavaliers. At first glance, it
would appear that we are playing
out of our class. At second gl snce,
it would appear that we are playing
out of our class. But do not give up
hope yet. Wait until after the ball
game. The Virginia squad has sev-
eral advantages. Hopefully, so do the
Generals. The night before this con-
test, the Cavaliers travel to Colum-
bia, South Carolina. This could have
a slight effect. Offensively, the Bluc
will run a 3-2 spread, in an attearpt
to neutralize the vast Virginia heighi
advantage. Coach Verne Canfie'd
also noted that, perhaps, the Cava-
liers can be pressed. Defensively, he
will employ a match-up defense.
Particular emphasis will be placed
on attempting to limit the second
and third shots taken by the Cava-
hiers.

history is made. Don't study history,
make it.

go against Towson State. Though
this will be no easy match for W&L,
the Generals have a good chance to
win if they can capture the crucial
lower weight classes. Dee Copen-
haver, the team’s captain, should be
wrestling better now that he has
recovered from ‘the flu. The vacancy
at 190 pounds, left by Bard Wrisley,
who has a ‘torn ligament, will be
filled ‘by Jay Fulcher.

Future meets are scheduled with
Loyola and Hampden-Sydney, both
small schools against whom the Gen-
erals should compete well. W&L will
also compete in a newly scheduled
tournament with American Uniiver-
sity, Catholic University and Gal-
laduet. With the toughest part of the

able to light his victory cigar soon.

LaRue’s Press Box

Notre Dame and Austin Carr

Word has it ‘that the National Col-

Athletic Association, the
body which governs the sports pro-
grams of America’s institutions of
higher learning, plans to launch an
investigation in to the activities of
one of its members, Notre Dame.
Urged to do so by Darrell Royal
and John Wooden, coaches of high
stature in the minds of other NCAA
members, the governing agency in-
tends to investigate the possibilities
of a special dispensation for that
Catholic University by one Pope
Paul.

Irish fans, still giddy from ther
team's New Year's Day upset victory
over Number One Texas, had even
more to crow about Saturday as
Notre Dame surprised UCLA’s top-
ranked ‘basketballers 89-82.

The two victories were similar in
nature; both times Notre Dame end-
ed lengthy winning streaks. Royal's
Longhorns were stopped after thirty
consecutive gridiron conquests and
the Bruins, prior to their efforts in
South Bend, had won 19 straight
under Wooden. But this year the
Irish have shown a tendency toward
the upset.

The combination of a red-hot
Austin Carr and an ice-cold Sidney
Wicks was too much for UCLA,
which never managed to ge! any
farther than a 47-47 tie. Carr pour-
ed in 46 points and was a priceless
psychological factor throughout the
game, as his unerring acourexy prov
ed virtually unstoppable. Equally de-
moralizing for the West Coast
quintet was the poor showing of its
ace, Wicks, who although accumu-
lating 23 points, was far from sharp

The entire Bruin team reflected a
poor showing with fifteen turnovers.
Another strong factor in the Irish
victory was control of the buards,

es i ee aca

 
  

thanks mainly to the efforts of John
Pleick.

The game was close to being a
carbon copy of another affair that
took place just three years and a
week ago today. Before a packed
house in the Astrodome, the Uni-
versity of Houston led by Elvin
Hayes clipped Lew Alcindor and the
Number One Bruins by 71-69. That
year Aloindor and UCLA came back
to avenge their loss, beating the
Cougars in the NOAA plaoffs.

Although UCLA has since been
beaten by other West Coast Fight
teams, the loss to Carr and the Irish
was the Californians’ first im non-
league competition since the Astro-
dome encounter,

All of which raises the question——
will lightning strike twice? A re-
match between Austin Carr and
Sidney Wicks in the NCAA playoffs,
simeilar to the UCLA-UH faceoff
three years ago would probably
prove to be a real juicer. And if it
comes off, the Pope will be plenty
busy.

; Peter Jones: From the Bird’s Nest...

Blunder, Irish, All-CAC

I hate to dwell on past matters but one can't help comment-
ing on the most recent revelation concerning the Blunder Bowl.
It seems that only two (out of many) calls were vigorously
protested by the Cowboys—one being the Johnny Unitas-to-
Eddie Hinton-to-John Mackey 75 yard touchdown pass, the
other being the one-quarter inch line fumble of Duane Thomas,
which was awarded to Baltimore.

After countless slow-motion, frame-by-frame, stop-action
scrutinies of the game film, the officials’ conclusion was drawn
that the Unitas pass was legal—though quite lacking in execu-
tion—but get this, the fumble was actually in Dallas posses-
sion, being recovered by center Dave Manders.

One certain official, name unkown to millions who saw
him, testified that he must have blown the ball dead and ruled
a Baltimore recovery while actually the ball was not in pos-
session of either team. Could you call this a job of poor officiat-
4 ing? More on the line of a junior high or high school game,

to be precise.

Skip Lichtfuss

Exemplifying this point of the officiating further was the
full-page color shot in last week’s “Sport's Illustrated” of
Baltimore defense back Rick Volk yanking at Reggie Rucker’s
face mask to the tune of an offensive pass interference call.

Colvin On Ecology
(Continued trom Page 3)

From a personal observation,
based on 17 years of active duty
on the conservation front, I would
say that the best way to participate
is to take one issue (not more) in
your own home State, inform your-
self about it, take the measure of
the opposition, actual and potential,
and get to work doing what you can.
Nobody is impressed with petitions
or form ‘letters.

But a well-written letter to the
editor, or a ‘brief to the Federal
Power Commission, or a reasoned
analysis sent to your Congressman
or Senator can pay off handsomely.
The main thing is to have the facts
and argue them dispassionately (but
not too dispassionately.)

C. T. Answers “Challenge”

To the Editors:

In December, I sent you a short
letter outlining the value of personal
reporting. Since that time, my sug-
gestion has been ballooned into a
farsical and facetious column,
“Quirks and Quibbles,” written by
one Monty Cottier—ipart time movie
critic.

Your lamentation that no one had
responded to your personal reporting
seemed to be a personal dare for
me to show my face again, (no
matter how many miles of “bad
road” it resembles), so | now re-
spond.

If you think that you have suffiici-
ently extinguished my small flame
of criticism or cowed me into morti-
fied silence beneath your giant waves
of sarcasm and thinly-veiled insults,
then you are greatly mistaken. |
wholeheartedly endorse your “Quirks

should continue, as it has brought a
certain degree of humor and in-
formality to The Ring-tuwm Phi. Ad-
mittedly, your first efforts were a
litthe rough, ‘but time an dexperience
should help smooth down the edges.

However, you must not allow
your surprising dislike for myself

your style. Surely you can expand
your attention to other hapless stu-
dents. I am sure that John and my-
self are in complete agreement on
this point.

the attention of persons reading
the above letter to the inordinate
paranoia so typical of the cur-

shown in the work. Not only does
it manifest a desire for anonymity
(C.T.? Claire Trevor?) but the

assocition” involving faculty, stu-
dents and administration in solv'ng
some of our more essential problems.
One area of concern must be the
role that the student body's elected
representative play in fund raising
and in decision on capital develop-
ment. How can students take a
greater role in a problem which con-
cerns the long-range quality of W&L
education.

Secondly, what about commun ty
spirit and its manifestations in en-
tertainment and sports, This is cer-
tainly important for two reasons.
One would be its potentially postive
effects on applicants and role as a
portion of what could be a better
life at W&L.

My impression has been that W&L
being as compact as it is, having all
the advantages of a small rural
sc'vool, has much less fun as a com-
munity than it ought to have. How
can we bring faculty member and
student together to find better ways
to utilize our campus facilities, Uni-
versity Center and to raise funds
for a variety of activities. And what
can be done to not only promote
intellectual fervor on campus but
a community “spirit” as well? Not
last, for one could enumerate end-
lessly the possible joint efforts that
should be undertaken by a “com-
munity government” is the future of
the Honor System which must be
preserved as an important component
of W&L life. How can it be strength-
ened and yet be brought up to date?

Finally, we are faced with one
central question. Are we as a stu-
dent body and as a community,
apathetic enough to allow govern-
ment at W&L to remain fragmented
and uwieldy? Do we have the in-
genuity to break away from tradition
and effectively experiment.

 

Of course, enthusiasm for such an
endeavor cannot be stimulated by
one Pinpoint; it is either ready to
emerge or not. However, in some
way, | believe we all want and hope
for better things for W&L in the
future. A better government would
be a start. Support the Constitutional
Convention with your ideas and par-
ticipation,

No matter how you feel about the war in
Vietnam, the fate of this prisoner of war
is a big deal. To his wife and children. To
his parents. To the signatories of the Geneva
Conventions. To all rational people in the

world,

The Red Cross is asking you to consider the
matter of prisoners of war and those who

are missing in action in Agia.

It is not asking you to take a stand on the
war itself. It is asking you to ask Hanoi to
observe the humanitarian provisions of the

Geneva Conventions.

Ask Hanoi to release the names of men it
holds prisoner. Ask them to allow prisoners
to communicate regularly with their fam-
ilies. Ask them to repatriate seriously ill
and wounded prisoners. Ask them to allow
a neutral intermediary to inspect places of

detention.

om Mays Discusses Convention A Few Facts For The ROTC

Question At Washington and Lee

(Continued from Page 2)

In a survey commissioned by the
Department of the Army, it was re-
vealed that freshmen enroll in the
program on campus for three major
reasons: (1) the desire to become a
commissioned officer, (2) a realiza-
tion of the possibility of being draft-
ed, and (3) the offering of academic
credit.

The same survey indicated that
about 20 per cent of all college
freshmen in R.O.T.C. programs de-
cided to join primarily because of
the credit offered.

There has been a steady depletion
in the R.O.T.C, ranks at W&L since
at least 1960. That year a total of
364 out of 1041 undergraduates was
enrolled in the unit, that is, abou’
35 per cent of the undergraduate
student ‘body. Last year the enroll-
ment was 160 out of a possible 1292,
or a little above 12 per cent.

The years 1967 through 1970
comprise the most drastic drop, from
27.3 per cent to 12 per cent of the
undergraduate total.

Of course, there are many fac‘ors
that contribute to this  statisi(cul
plunge, and no one can say how the
new draft lottery will effect these
figures. But one must admit that the
abolition of academic credit for the
R.O.T.C, program is a latent risk to

ma‘ter of past~<lue accounts.

A discussion of a possible system
of faculty evaluation resulted in no
definite action. The University Fed-
eration had earlier in the year ex-
pressed a desire to conduct such an
evaluation, but has found that the
undertaking is unfeasible for them.
The EC members postponed further
discussion until a later meeting,

assess this system until that time.
But the fact that a student has to
take more than one course in the
spring term seems to defeat the
whole purpose of a short term.

With the number of hours requir-
ed one almost has to take more
than the minimum in the Spring
term. While it seem sthat the pur-
pose of a short term is to fully ex-
plore ome subject, the set-up pre-
cludes that and it may be just
another term only shorter. This de-
foats the idea behind having a short
term and ruins the possibility for real
intellectual involvement. But we will
have to wait and see.

the already descending roll.

Finally, in order to attain a
latent risk to the already descending
roll.

Finally in order io attain a
thorough appraisal of the R.O.T.C.
credit issue, we should have some
idea of the views of those now en-
rolled. This year the Military Science
department surveyed the program’s
juniors on this and other questions.

The evaluation reveals that 18 of
21 students feel class time is of
“some” to “much” value. 13 of the
21 say the courses are of college
level and intellectually challenging.
All waited their instructor between
the middle and top fifths of those
teachers they have had in the uni-
versity, as far as teaching ability is
concerned. 19 of the 21 indicated
that their subject matter was pre-
sented clearly.

Of course this data, too, must b:
considered carefully, but it clearly
refutes any suggestion that R.O.T.C.
students have no regard for the
academic merit of the program.

A close scrutiny of the academic
status of any department in the uni-
versity needs to be constant and
critical. But for such criticism to be
legtimatte, one must not forsake the
complexity of the issue, and political
iprejudices must be recognized for
what they are.

The Illinois legislator echoed a
suggestion made earlier in the sym-
posium by writer Philip Abbott
Luce, when he encouraged the trial
of the voucher plan for secondary
schools, Chamipioned by many in
the Conservative ranks, such as Mil-
ton Friedman and William Buckley,
the proposal would return a tax
rebate of a set sum to parents with
school-age children so that they
could choose the school, private or
public, which they wished to pa-
tronize.

In theory the voucher system's
vontue would be the introduction of
the free market idea, to set schools
in competition for increased quality.
“The most promising program in the
CEO (Office of Economic Oppor-
tunity) Was an experimental test of
the vouched plan iin selected Cali-
fornia schools,” Crane remarked.
According to Congressmen Grane,
however the proposed experiment
was recently killed by “pressure from
the teachers’ unions.”
