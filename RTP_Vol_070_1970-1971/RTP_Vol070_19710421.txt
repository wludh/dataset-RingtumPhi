On Committees

By RICK GRAY

One of the integral parts of stu-
dent government at Washington and
Lee is the existence of the various
standing committees. These commit-
tees, in one form or another, oversee
many phases of student life.

The various standing committees
are; Student Control, Student Fi-
nancial Relations, Student Recruit-
ment, Curriculum, Library, and Uni-
versity Center-Orientation,

The Student Control Committee is
responsible for regulating student
conduct in Lexington and the sur-
rounding area, including nearby
girls’ schools. The Student Financial
Relations Committee, formerly the
Cold Check Committee, is respon-
sible for maintaining good relations
between students and local mer-
chants, thus protecting the students’
privilege of writing and negotiating
checks in Lexington.

The Student Financial Relations
Committee does have fining power
to punish those students whose
checks are returned for payment.

The newest of the committees is
concerned with Student Recruitment
and it has been very active this year.
This committee sends representa-
tives to different high schools talk-
ing up Washington and Lee and
answering questions of prospects.

The responsiblities of the Cur-
riculum Committee are the review-
ing of Washington and Lee’s Cur-
riculum and the presentation of
student views on the academic en-
vironment of the University.

The Library Committee is respon-
sible for overseeing student use of
McCormick Library and the dif-
ferent departmental libraries. This
committee does have the power to
fine students who abuse this privi-
lege by damaging or destroying
books.

The University Center-Orientation
Committee has a two-fold purpose,
first, during freshman orientation,
this commitice is responsible for
coordinating the various orientation
activities, and secondly, during the
rest of the school year, it sponsors
social, recreational, and cultural
activities for the university com-
munity, using the University Center
facilities.

Dean Adams Dies;
W&L Mourns Loss

Dr. Lewis Whitaker Adams, dean
of the School of Commerce and
Administration for 20 years, died
April 3 in Lexington following a
long illness.

A graveside funeral service was
conducted in Stonewall Jackson
Cemetery in Lexington Monday,
April 5,

Dr. Adams, who would have been
67 on April 8, joined Washington
and Lee’s faculty in 1926 as assistant
professor of economics.

He earned his bachelor of science
degree in 1925 from the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
then taught economics at Cornell
for a year. His initial stay at Wash-
ington and Lee was short, only three
years; he returned to Cornell for
another year in 1930,

In 1940, he decided that teach-
ing—specifically, teaching at Wash-
ington and Lee—was his first love.
He returned, this time as assistant
professor of economics. Nine years
later, not long after receiving his
doctorate, he became dean—the posi-
tion he was to hold the next two
decades.

“His death brings true sadness,
for he was deeply respected and be-
loved by his many friends here and
by the hundreds of students whose
affection for him was of that special
variety reserved for those who pro-
foundly touched and vitalized their
lives,” said President Robert E. R.
Huntley after Dean Adams’ death.

Under Dr. Adams’ leadership,
Washington and Lee’s commerce
school maintained its membership

Speak

China, where he served until 1940,
His subsequent missions included
service in Hankow, Kunming,
Chungking and Nanking.

He was a member of the inter-
national secretariat at the United
Nations Conference in San Fran-
cisco, and served with Gen. Wede-
meyer's mission to China and Korea
in 1947,

Amb. Sprouse was head of the
State Department's Chinese Affairs
division under President Truman,
before going to embassies in Paris
and Brussels during the 1950s. He
was an envbassy officer in Washing-
ton at the time of his designation
as anvbassador to Cambodia.

He was ambassador to Pnompenh
during the crisis that developed be
tween the two nations over a remark
made by Canrbodia’'s state-controlled
radio at the time of President Ken-
nedy’s assassination, when anrbassa
dors were recalled for a time.

Prince Sihanouk refused to accept
the credentials of Amb. Sprouse’s
successor in 1964, and when Cam-
bodia broke off relations with the
United States in May, 1965, the
embassy was technically without an
accredited anvbassador.

Born in Greenbrier,
1906, Anrvb. Sprouse earned the
bachelor of arts degree in 1928
from Washington and Lee. His alma
mater awarded him the honorary
degree of doctor of laws in 1963

Tenn., in

in the extremely selective American
Association of Collegiate Schools of
Business. Only the best one-fifth of
commerce schools in the country
are eligible for membership, and

in the organization.

merce school and to the university
and its students,” remarked Dr.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK: a

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Scholarship Donated
In Memory of Manly

April 21, 1971 Mr.

A major new endowed scholarship ‘by

Dean Lewis Adams

My first personal contact with Lew Adams took place in
1952. | was a young instructor seeking a teaching position,
Lew was a new dean hiring his first teacher. Lew was nervous ;
| was seared,

We established a rapport at that first meeting—a rapport
that continued for almost 20 years. As I think back, [ am
sure that there were a number of times when we did not
agree, but | think that there was never a time when we did
not respect each other (1 hope not).

Lew was one of the few truly dedicated men | have ever
known. There were only two important things in his life—
his family and the Washington and Lee School of Commerce.
He had no hobbies, no outside interests, just complete im-
mersion in family and school. All his thoughts and all his
activities were directed to one or the other of these two
concerns.

Lew wanted Washington and Lee to have the best under-
graduate business school in the country. To achieve this goal
he wanted the best teaching faculty that he could find, the
best possible business major, and a dedicated, proud student
body. I believe that he came close as was possible to the
achievement of these goals prior to his retirement as dean.
The school was, and is, his school in a very real sense.

No one worked as hard at teaching and as dean than Lew
Adams. He was always the first one in the office in the morn-
ing and the last one to leave at night. He was, without doubt,
the most meticulous preparer of lectures, and grader of papers
| have ever known. His textbooks were profusely under-
lined, margins filled with handwritten comments, and jammed
with current material pertinent to the course. He agonized
over each examination paper, and filled the margins with de-
tailed comments. It was not at all unusual for Lew to read
a single paper four and five times when the grade was crucial
to the student being examined.

He was a tough teacher. No one in business finance or
investments completed the course without knowing a great
deal about the subject matter. Despite his demanding classes
he won the lasting respect of those he taught. I have heard
more than one student apologize to him for “letting him down”
by writing an examination that was less than Lew expected,
His sympathy and understanding for students was deep, par-
ticularly for those students who were not doing well. Many
of the endless hours he spent in his office were devoted to
students problems—academic, career, and personal.

During his tenure as dean, Lew hired 15 of the present
17 faculty members now in the school. It was his firm belief
that the most important legacy he could leave future genera-
tions of Washington and Lee students was the best possible
faculty he could find and afford, Almost all of us remember
the experience of visiting the campus to be interviewed for
a teaching job, staying at Lew’s home, being wined and
dined by his charming wife, and discussing the various facets
of undergraduate education and teaching.

It was Lew’s firm belief that you could tell a great deal
about a man at breakfast—particularly if he had had a few
bourbons and had been kept up until three or four o'clock
in hot discussion the evening before. It was a very disconcert-
ing experience, especially since Dean Adams seemed to thrive
on no sleep.

Lew was in the forefront of those members of the American
\ssociation of Collegiate Schools of Business who constantly
pushed for revision of the major requirements, He was justly
proud of our position in this Association. Washington and
lee is the smallest school accredited by the Association,

There is no doubt in my mind that Lew’s single-minded
devotion to his responsibilities as dean weakened his health
He never spared himself when something needed to be done
We will all miss his presence, but we will also keep in mind
the example he set for all of us.

Traveller, Lee’s horse throughout the Civil War, will be buried close
to the general near Lee Chapel this spring.

Traveller’s Re-Burial Set
For Chapel Observance

Traveller, Robert E. Lee's faith-
ful gray horse, will be reinterred on
the campus May 8, near the crypt
where his master lies buried.

Officials of the United Daughters
of the Confederacy will join with the
the University in unveiling and de-
dicating a granite marker at the
gravesite at 3:00 p.m.

The ‘bones of Lee's favorite horse
were dug up from their original
campus gravesite in 1907, and for
many years the skelton was on dis-
play at the Lee Museum in Lee
Chapel. Through the years they de-
ertiorated badly, and when the
Chapel was restored in 1963, they
were removed from display and
placed in storage.

Lee had the Chapel built while
serving as president of Washington
College from 1865 until his death in
1870. During those years, Traveller
was a familiar sight on the college
campus, being ridden by Lee or
grazing on the campus lawn. His

stable adjoining the President's
House remains there today as a
garage.

Lee often spoke and wrote of
his great love for Traveller. The
iron gray horse, with black mane
and tail, was with the General
throughout the Civil War and car-
ried him through many battles.

When Gen. Lee died here in 1870,
Traveler walked in the funeral pro-
cession, his master’s military boots
reversed in his stirrups. He lived for
another two years, dying at age 15

Francis Pickens Miller, most
persistent foe of the Byrd “organiza
tion” in Virginia, will be honored
by Washington and Lee's Bookstore
April 27, the day before his auto
biography is to be published

The new book, “Man From the

with the UNC Press, the Bookstore
will have advance copies on hand

Miller is a 1914 graduate of
Washington and Lee, and was the
university's first Rhodes Scolar, In
“Man From the Valley,” he describes
the university and its Honor System

ing influences in his public and
private life

His career as leader of Virginia's
anti-Byrd forces began with his
election as Fairfax County's repre
sentative in the House of Delegates
in 1938, and culminated with his
unsuccessful challenges in Demo

program has been established at
Washington and Lee in memory of
Basil Manly, a 1906 graduate of
the university and distinguished gov-
ernment economist, corporate ex-
ecutive and author.

The Basil Manly Memorial Schol-
arships will be awarded competi-
tively to entering students at Wash-
ington and Lee on the bases of
personal character, academic prom-
ise, and financial need, university
president Robert E. R. Huntley
said in announcing establishment of
the program.

The newly created program is one
of the most substantial and im-
portant scholarship funds at Wash-
ington and Lee, President Huntley
said.

Prospective Manly Scholars will
visit the university on “scholarship
weekend,” when competition begins
for the institution’s most prestigi-
ous scholarships. The weekend is
held each spring, and a_ highly
select group of outstanding students
who will enter Washington and Lee
as freshmen the following fall visit
the campus for personal interviews
with the financial aid committee.

The first Manly Scholarships will
be awarded to students entering the
university as freshmen this Septem-
ber.

Alienation Of The Military

By MARC SMALL

It is ironic—and indicative of the
irrationality of our age—that the
protest against the Viet-Nam conflict
has centered so thoroughly on the
military, and has, until quite recently,
ignored the civilian authorities who
ordered the military into Viet-Nam.

Unlike Soviet Russia or Hitlerite
Germany, our armed services are
subordinate to the elected civilian
government, and, while military ex-
perts might urge one or another
particular course, they themselves
are hardly responsible for the actions
of popularly-elected executive of
legislative officials.

Yet, the military, as the most
prominent part of the American
involvement in South-East Asia, is
afflicted with a wave of protest
demonstrations, bombings, and sub-
versions.

The end effect of this will be
the eventual alientation of our mili-

 

own expense. Each of us received
a small grant from the University
for this purpose.

It was a fine gesture of support
for and interest in this program on
the part of the administration. There
is no doubt in my mind that this
spring's programs will be successful
and more than justify the “con-
sidered risk” represented by last
summer's grants.

David B. Dickens
Chairman,
Foreign Study Commiltee

Released

Son of a clergyman, Miller grow
up in Rockbridge County and was
educated at home prior to entering
Washington and Lee. Although a
layman, he has consistenly been in-
volved in Christian service orgamza
tions, inchiding the World Counc!
of Churches, which he served as
central commitiee member from
1954 until 1960

In World War I he saw action as
an artilleryman with the First Di
vision in France, and in Workd War
ll he served as colonel on General
Eisenhower's staff at SHABF, and
was decorated by the American,
British, French and Belgian govern
ments

Miller's challenges to Battle and
Byrd the most serious the
organization” experienced until the
1960's. By the end of that decade,
however. of Miller's ideas
considered “radical” when he pro

wefe

maosl

posed them—had been pul into
effect in Virginia. In an editorial in
1969, the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot
termed him “The Political Winner
After All”

Ihe reception for Miller ai the
Hooksiore wil Re held fram 3:10

until Sp.m. The public is invited

tary from its civilian roots; we will
become, like Voltaire’s Prussia, “an
army with a state.” The professional
cadre of the armed forces have
already begun to feel themselves
divorced from the civilian sectors
of the society; to what level will
an extrapolation of this factor over
two or three decades reach?

Will we have a military in which
the great majority of the partici-
pants are career-oriented and have
little or no real interest in the
civilian world around them?

The danger in this is apparent:
it is far more likely for a profes-
sional army with its career officers
to attempt to exert its influence on
the political sphere which encom-
passes it, or if conditions have de-
generated sufficiently, to seize the
very reins of power which now
bridle it. Even if this sort of coup
d'etat were not to take place, it is
stil likely that such a structure
would become an ingrained, self-
perpetuating force in the political
areana, acting in much the way the
Japanese military did under the
Meiji Constitution.

Given our current sentiment and
social atmosphere, “Seven Days in
May” is far more likely with an

alienated, ingrown military than
from a  popularly-supported and
civilian<iominated force.

However great the laws in the

sysiem, they are flaws whose solu-
tion is found in civilian control and
civilian support for the citizen-
soldier heritage of our nation, not
in the social disfranchisement of
the military. This is owr military;

FRANCIS PICKENS MILLER

Manly’s widow, daughter,
and grandsons. Basil Manly was
named a fellow in political science
science at the University of Chicago
after earning his A.B. degree from
Washington and Lee. He was award-
ed the master of arts degree from
Chicago in 1910,

He served as chairman of the Fed-
eral Power Commission for three
years during World War Il, as co-
chairman with William Howard
Taft of the War Labor Board in
the first World War, and drafted
two of the most comprehensive and

important labor reports in this
century.

His four-volume Iron and Steel
Report, issued in 1912, laid the

foundation for abolishing the seven-
day work week and for adopting the
eight-hour day, and is recognized as
the most significant investigation of
a single American industry.

The Child Labor Report, issued
by the U. S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics, with which he was an
expert, and known as the “Manly
Report,” was 11 volumes in length
and, with an edition of 100,000
copies, was the most widely cir-
culated such government document
ever issued.

Following issuance of the two
landmark investigative documents,
Manly served as director of investi-
gation for the U.S. Commission on
Industrial Relations and subsequ-
ently as an economist for the Federal
Power Commission and for the
states of New York and Wisconsin.

In 1931 he drafted a new Corrupt
Practice Act while serving as special
counsel to the U.S. Senate Com-
mittee on Campaign Expenditures,
and in World War Il was named by
President Roosevelt as vice-chair-
man of the National Defense Power
Committee. In 1944 he was appoint-
ed supervising commissioner with
the Natural Gas _ Investigation
agency, and shortly thereafter he
retired from governmental service
to become vice-president and di-
rector of the Southern Natural Gas
Company.

In addition to government work,
Mr. Manly served as economic ad-
visor to the Newspaiper Enterprise
Association and as special cor-
respondent for several newspapers,
inchuding the Brooklyn Eagle, the
New York World and the Newark
Evening News.

His wife, who shared in establish-
ing the new scholarship program at
Washington and Lee in his memory,
is the former Miss Marie Merriman
Bradley. They were married in Lex-
ington Dec. 15, 1912. He died in
Washington, D.C. May 11, 1950.

Mr. Manly was the son of the
Rev. and Mrs. Charles Manly. Rev.
Manly was president of Furman
University from 1881 until 1897,
and subsequently served as pastor of
the Lexington Baptist Ohurch from
1903 until 1914. The Rev. Manly’s
father, Basil Manly, had himself
been a university president (Ala-
bama).

Shortly after his death in 1924,
the congregation of the Lexington
Baptist Church renamed the church
Manly Memorial, in recognition of
the “unusual love and esteem” in
which its members held him.

LaRue’s Press Box

 
 

This is going to be extremely hard
to write, although I really don’t
have to maintain a great degree of
objectivity in this column. I would
just like to take the time to thank
all those who made the ‘baseball
squad's spring trip to Houston the
success that it was. In so doing, I
must cast aside standard journalistic
routine in favor of large measures
of gratititude and emotion and more
than a little filial love.

Thank to the efforts of W. H. La-
Rue, the W&L alumni, and Coach
Joe Lyles, the Generals wined,
dined, and even played six ball
games. Alumni and parents of cur-
rent students housed the players,
for six nights providing them with
breakfast. Extravagant suppers were
concocted by Mr. LaRue; barbecued
chicken, steak teriyaki, spaghetti,
and roast beef were among the fare.
We may not have been the best ball
club in Texas, but we were un-
doubtedly the best fed.

The Generals encountered rather
stiff opposition, however, and must-
ered only one victory in six tries.
But what a game to win! W&L
dropped the first three matches to
Rice, but the Big Blue rallied three
times to conquer the Owls in the
final contest 6-5, coming wp with
three runs in the last inning to
win it.

 

THANKS

Thursday, powerful San Jacinto
Junior College, 35-3 at the time,
notched two more victories by ‘beat-
ing the Generals in a windy double
header.

Folloiwng the twinbill, the W&L
iballplayers and fourteen prospective
freshmen from the Houston area
were hosted by the alumni at a din-
ner given at the San Jacinto Inn.

The trip was successful in three
respects. Beside the fact that it
marked the first time, as far as any-
one knows, that W&L has ever
played in Texas, or defeated a South-
west Conference club, the journey
provided the Generals with a look
at top-notch competition, The team
should benefit from the experience
as it seeks a CAC championship.

Secondly, the trip was a great
move in the field of alumni rela-
tions. The Houston crowd, somewhat
remote from recent happenings at
their alma mater, was genuinely
enthused by our journey, as was
shown by the dinner on the final
night. And thirdly, the gathering
was an excellent opportunity to
acquaint the prospective students
who had already been accepted, with
Washington and Lee. In short, the
trip was not only advantageous to
the ball club but was also a tre-
mendously informative good will

Stickmen Capture A Patr;
Nearly Upset Midshipmen

Washington and Lee’s powerful
Lacrosse Team journeyed to Con-
necticut and Maryland over Spring
vacation, returning to Lexington
with two easy victories and a near
upset of traditionally strong Navy.

The official aspect of the trip
‘began with a game against Wesleyan
University, located in Middletown,
Connecticut. The Generals started
strong, piling up a 6-0 lead after
sophomore Skip Lichtfuss hap open-
ed the scoring after only thirteen
seconds of play.

Wesleyan closed to within 6-2 in
the second quarter, but the first of
All-American Whitney Morrill’s
three goals produced a 7-2 lead and
the Generals went on to a 13-6
victory.

The stickmen next faced the Uni-
versity of Connecticut, which many
felt would be a more severe chal-
lenge than Wesleyan. The Huskies
made this prediction look good by
scoring first before W&L tied it at
1-1 in the first period. Connecticut
seemingly had regained the lead in
the last seconds of the quarter, but
their goal was ruled late.

The “goal” was to be Connecti-
cut’s last. Washington and Lee built
up a 4-1 lead in the second period
and breezed to a 10-1 victory. Sam
Englehart, John Lalley, and Ted
Bauer had two goals each. Other
scores were by Lichtfuss, Morrill,
Chip Tompkins, and Jim McCane.

The highlight game thus far on
the season took place Saturday in
Annapolis when Washington and
Lee faced a Navy squad that had
won part of the National Champion-
ship last year and was ranked third
in the country by two major polls
this season. The Generals themselves
were rated tenth in the coaches’ poll
and seventh by The Baltimore Sun.

A large, crowd, including a hardy
group of W&L backers was on hand
as Navy jumped off to a quick 1-0
lead after only seconds of play.

Englehart quickly tied the score
and the teams exchanged goals

throughout much of the first half.
Three times the Midshipmen grab-
‘bed one goal leads, but Hank Slau-
son, Jim Farrar, and Morrill came
back to get the Generals even.

Lichtfuss’ second quarter goal
‘broke the pattern and gave W&L its
first lead at 5-4, and, after Navy
tied it, Morrill’s second score pro-
duced a 6-5 edge for the Generals
at halftime.

The first goal of the second half
belonged to Navy and produced yet
another deadlock, but tallies by
Bauer and McCane, still in the third
quarter, gave Washington and Lee
an 8-6 lead. Poised Navy battled
‘back, however, and drew even by the
end of the period.

Navy’s two goals were the only
scores of the fourth quarter and
handed the Generals their first loss
of the season, 10-8.

have the obligation of giving it not
only that measure of givilian con-
trol necessary in a republican gov-
ernment, but also that support and
well-wishing vital to preserve the
morale and loyalty of its members.
Our Congressional leaders have
authorized the military involvement
in Viet-Nam and then, in a political
about-face, have ‘busily criticized
it. Our media have vented their bile
constantly on the military for obey-
ing the orders of their civilian
leaders. Our college students have
directly rejected the efforts of their
brothers and neighbors in fulfilling
an obligation to their native land.
Is it any wonder that the military
is embittered? Is it any wonder that
the military no longer feels itself
the recipient of public trust?
However great the faults of the
military, it is our duty to correct
them—but not to despise a military
structure which is no more than the
reflection of that society it defends.

Baseball Squad Defeats Rice on Texas Trip

(Continued from page 3)

while San Jacinto Junior College, a
national power loaded with pro
prospects triumphed twice in lop-
sided encounters.

Rice took the opening game of
the trip 3-2 scoring all the runs in
the second inning. The Owls follow-
ed this with a 11-2 win, with hits
by Robert LaRue and Ellie Gutshall
and a walk to David Traylor helping
to produce the W&L scores.

Washington and Lee dropped a
third decision to the Southwest Con-

ference club by a 4-2 count. A walk
to Gutshall, a double by Grayson
Fitzhugh, and hits by Fred Paone,
Jerry Johnson, and Jim Nolan made
up the W&L rally.

The lone victory of the trip was
a 6-5 win over the Owls with the
Generals storming from behind for
three runs in the seventh in an out-
burst keyed by hits from FitzHugh
and Doug Clelan.

The strong Jacinto team crushed
the Generals by scores of 10-2 and
7-0. W&L managed only three hits
in the second game.

‘His’ Students Respected Adams

(Continued from Page 1)

Charles F. Phillips Jr., who was
persuaded to come to Washington
and Lee in 1959 by Dean Adams,
“were perhaps most strikingly re-
flected in the hours he kept. He came
to work early, and stayed almost
through the night.”

A key to Dean Adams’ educa-
tional philosophy was the paramount
value he saw in a broad, humane
education. Firmly he chose to direct
his students away from over-specili-
zation; majors were, and are, offered
in “core” subjects, such as com-
merce, accounting, administration
and economics rather than in narrow
and extremely technical sub-fields.

Dr. Adams often remarked that
he cherished Washington and Lee’s
reputation as a teaching institution,
and he himself continued to teach
every semester in addition to his
administrative duties.

His reputation in business circles
and among graduate schools was
such—and that of the Commerce
School under his direction—that his

men prized a recommendation from
Dean Adams second only to the
Washington and Lee diploma itself.

One of Dean Adams’ significant
legacies—there are too many to
list— is the quality of the faculty
he recruited to the School of Com-
merce. Not only are they outstand-
ing teachers of young men, his first
requirement; they are scholars of
national eminence in their profes-
sions.

Between 1949 and 1969, students
changed in countless respects. But
from the first whose diploma he
signed to the last, there was at least
one enduring characteristic: they
were “his” men, every one of them,
and they loved him deeply for it.
