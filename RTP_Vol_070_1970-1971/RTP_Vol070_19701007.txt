A Tribute To General Robert F. Lee

Ceremonies For Lee Will

Be Conducted In Chapel

The hundredth anniversary of the
death of Robert E. Lee will be com-
memorated at Washington and Lee
University Oct. 10 during a special
ceremony in the Lee Chapel, which
he built in 1867 while he was presi-
dent of what was then Washington
College.

Lee died Oct. 12 on the campus in
the President's Home, also built dur-
ing his presidency of the institution.

The ceremony will also mark the
centennial of the decisions—both
made within weeks of Lee’s death—
by the college’s faculty and board of
trustees to re-name the institution,
incorporating Lee’s name with that
of Washington.

Robert Edward Royall Huntley,
Lee’s seventh successor as leader of
the university, will deliver the prin-
cipal address at the ceremony. Spec-
ial guests at the observance will be
a number of Gen. Lee’s descendants,
as well as officials of the United
Daughters of the Confedenrcy, the
Society of the Lees of Virginia, and
representatives of various histori-
cal organizations.

The noontime service will follow
a meeting in Lexington of Wash-
ington and Lee’s board of trustees,
and they will participate in the pro-
gram as well.

See Editorial Comment, Page 2

and Article, Page 3.

Oct. 10, the closest weekend date
to the actual anniversary of Lee's
death Oct. 12, 1870, will also bring
alumni from five graduating classes
back to the university for reunions.
Members of the Lee Associates, a
group of Washington and Lee's dis-
tinguished benefactors, will also
convene in Lexington that weekend
and will be honored guests for the
event, to which the public is invited.

Washingion and Lee University’s
glee club, under the direction of
james T. Cook, will sing several se-
lections during the program.

Lee’s death came almost exactly
five years after he arrived in Lexing-
ton to assume leadership of the de-
stitute, war-ravaged little school. He
had surprised nobody more than its
trustees when he accepted their bold
offer, for it involved a salary of only
$1,500 a year, and a social, educa
tional challenge that was almost
unbelievably formidable.

From 1865 to 1870, in what one

president of the university termed
“Lee's Final Achievement,” the de-
feated general transformed the un-
distinguished college into a thriivng
national university of major educa-
tional vitality — almost singlehand-
edly.

He died, apparently of a heart ail-
ment, in the dining room of the
house designed for him and Mrs. Lee
(and since occupied by each of his
successors). He was buried on Oct.
15, 1870, in the campus chapel he
designed and ‘built, where his wife,
parents, children and other relatives
are now buried with him.

1940, 1950, and 1965; Homecoming
itself; and special centennial com-
memorations of General Lee’s death
and the changing of Washington
College’s name to The Washington
and Lee University. There will also
be a special reception and banquet
for the Robert E. Lee Associates,

Washburn of the Alumni House, is
an association of exceptional bene-
factors of the University.

After the Homecoming football
game against Hampden-Sydney and
the crowning of the Homecoming
queen, a grain party sponsored by
the sophomore class and open to

Dorm Parietals

Four men were nominated and
endorsed as candidates for the
Rhodes Scholarship in the Monday
afternoon faculty meeting. They
are Marvin C. Henberg. Stephen R.

Haughney, John Lillard Hl, and
Joseph B. Tompkins, Jr.
Other faculty business included

the election of professor Thomas G.
Nye to the Student Affairs Commit-
tee and action on proposed changes
for parietal procedures in the fresh-
man dorms.

Henberg. now a graduate student
in Philosophy at the University of
Texas, graduated summa cum laude
last June. While here, he was presi-
dent of the student body and a mem-
ber of Phi Beta Kappa and Omicron
Delta Kappa.

Haughney, an English major, is
second ranking man in the present
senior class. He has served on the
Student Curriculum Committee and
taught during the past summer in an
experimental high school in Cleve-
land. He was elected to Phi Beta
Kappa as a junior.

Lillard is eighth in a class of 51
enior lawyers and serves as assoc:
ate editor of the Law Review. He
has been a member of the University
Student Control Commiitee, chair-
man of the Grievance Committee
ind of the Honors and Awards Com
mittee of the Student Bar Associa
tion

Tompkins, a politics major, is
third man in the present senior class
academically and was elected to Phi
Beta Kappa his junior year. He was
elected to the student body Execu
live Commiticee as a freshman,
sophomore, and senior. As a junior

Effective Oct. 16

he was Vice-President of the stu-
dent body. He was one of four un-
dergraduates in the nation to at-
tend the eight-week program of the
Federal Executive Institute.

The basic change in the plan for
freshman dorm self-government pass-
ed by the faculty was a speeding up
of the date when freshman parietal
plans will go into effect. Under this
years plan, the freshman parictals
can begin by the fifth weekend after
class beginnings (this year, Oct. 16).

During the interim period until
self-determined parietals begin, fresh-
man may have girls visiting the
dorms during the following hours:
Friday from 7:00 p.m. until mid-
night, Saturday from 1:00 p.m. un-
til midnight, and Sunday from 1:00
p.m. until 5:00 p.m.

The new proposals were presented
to the Student Affairs Committee
last week by Phil Thompson on be-
half of the freshman dorm coun-
selors. The plan met with the unani-
mous approval of SAC and was en-
dorsed by the faculty.

The meeting was attended by Siu-
dent Body President Fran Lawrence
and Vice President Phil Thompson
Lawrence made the customary pres-
entation given by the Student Body
president on the honor system. He
also requested that faculty mem-
bers on an individual basis cooperate
with individual students who wish to
make plans to leave campus to cam
paign for candidates this fall. No ac
tion was taken on Lawrence's plea,
but Lawrence expressed confidence
that students would meet with gen
eral cooperation and understanding

EC Tackles Budget;
Discusses Finances

BY RITA ENNIS

Budget problems are plaguing the
Executive Committee. Considerable
time was spent in Monday night's
committee meeting discussing the
Operational possibilities of a Stu-
dent Body Budget as well as fund
allocations, especially to the Stu-
dent Bar Association.

The Student Finance Committee
(consisting temporarily of Senior
Representative Joe Tompkins and
Vice ‘President Phil Thomp-
son) presented an auditor's state-
ment of expenditures for the 1969-70
session. The audit revealed that the
EC spent $1636.77 last year and
that the Student Body Reserve Fund
is dwindling. The Executive Com-
mittee has approximately $2000 for
disbursement this year. The Finance
Committee was established to con-
sider financial problems and the feas-
ibility of an operational budget.
Three additional committee mem-
bers are being sought.

Student Bar Association President
Rob Hartmann submitted a request
for $900 in additional funds. (At
present SBA receives 4Sc per Univer-
sity student from the Student Acti-
vities Fee.) Hartmann saw his re-
quest as an “interim measure” until
an $20-$30 tuition raise for the Law
School students could be obtained
to cover costs,

Noting that the Law School stu-
dent body has increased at least 25
per cent this year, Hartmann re-
quested the additional funds primar-
ily for social events and an expand-
ed speaker program. A lengthy dis-
cussion followed in which the follow-
ing arguments were brought for-
ward:
la) The Law School students pay
the same Activities Fee as un-
dergraduates, yet receive little
benefit from the Calyx, Ring-
tum Phi, or Ariel,

Phe EC makes an annual alloca-
tion of approximately $400 to
the Law Review to balance the
Activities Fee inequities.
2a) SBA needs money to cover soc-
ial events through the year
Hartmann contends these are
basic and important functions
for the Law School.
2b) Undergraduate entertainment is
not subsidized by the EC. Un
dergraduates pay class dues.
fraternity dues, dance plan and
admission fees to cover costs
The Speaker Program, which
should be an asset at a Law
School, is severly lacking ai
WAL. Since undergrads would
also benefit from an expanded
Program, the EC should sub
sidize the program
3b) Undergraduates do not rely on
EC subsidies for speaker pro
grams. They pay Contact assess
ments which Law Students do

Ib)

not pay. Admission fees could
be charges to cover speaker
costs.

President Fran Lawrence referred
action of the SBA request to the
Student Finance Committee.

An allocation of $275 for a mim-
eograph machine for the use of
the EC was unanimously approved.
When time is available, the machine
may also be used by students at cost
plus 10 per cent. President Law-
rence noted that reduced printing
costs, time saved, and the need for
better communications with the stu-
dents justified this expense.

In other EC action, the Freshman
election schedule was announced,
committee and subcommittee reports
were presented, and Alumni weck-
end events were disclosed.

Lawrence also announced that he
appeared before the Monday after-
noon faculty meeting to encourage
cooperation of the faculty should
some students chose to leave camp-
us in the time prior to elections to
work in a political campaign. He
urged faculty members to “act on an
individual basis” to help the students
make up work on test missed during
such an absence.

Petitions for Freshman Election
participation are due to Rich Mur-
ray by Oct. 12 and must have 50
signatures. Primary elections are slat-
ed for Oct. 19; runoff elections Oct.
22. Freshmen should not apply for
membership on standing committees
until after class elections.

In a report from the Cold Check
Committee, Chairman Henry Harke:
noted the committee has $100-$150
in extra reserve funds which could
be reallocated to an EC project.
Harkey is to report on possible uses
of the funds at a later date. Unanim
ous approval of the EC greeted Har-
key’s proposed name change for his
committee to “the Student Financial
Relations Committee.”

Phil Thompson reported that the
recruitment of volunteers for the
Honor System Study Committee ex
ceeded his expectations and that the
committee size may be increased up
to 25 members, “A largerthan-com
mon committee membership could
facilitate,” said Thompson, “the
gfeatest amount of involvement pos-
sible in this type of investigation.”
A meeting of committee membe:
applicants is scheduled for tomor
row at 7:30 p.m. in the EC room.

Glen Azuma, Junior Represents
live, told the EC that the Consiitu
tion Committee had made some pro
gress but were not ready to consider
membership applications or definite
future action

THE RING-TUM PHI

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

OCTOBER 7, 1970

The Payne 21 Paradox

Payne 21. The name of the building and the number of the
room appear on a small quantity of class schedule sheets mys-
teriously printed by an IBM machine at the beginning of each
term. The classroom is similar to any other in the building, or
for that matter, to any other on campus. Except for a small
metal plaque outside the entrance to the room,

There, on October 2, 1865, General Robert le. Lee became
President Robert E. Lee, and a small cow college with a corn
field for a front lawn began to change because of that one
man.

So? One might gaze about this campus and point to this
plaque or that building and say, “General Lee was here,” or,
“he was responsible for this.’ Everyone will smile vaguely and
walk away with another fact that can recite about the man.

But people are not plaques or buildings. General Lee was
a man who will never be known; and to clutch at the straws of
memorabilia in attempt to capture his essence can only serve
to dim his true brilliance as a man.

We are not interested in how he has affected present day
Washington and Lee. To us, the motivation behind his meteo
ric career at Washington College is the essence of the man.

The following excerpt from Clifford Dowdey’s “Lee” cap-
tures a glimpse of his spirit—a spirit which still remains at the
institution which now bears his name along with Washngton’s.

“To Lee, education for the future depended as much on char
acter as learning, and to him character was built upon the
habits of self-control. He did not believe that intelligent self-
government in men would be promoted by forcing students
under compulsion, supported by penalties, to perform class
assignments and conform to rules of personal behavior.

“... Lee tended by appeal to force a boy to look at himself
as a man to who the president had extended the courtesy of as-
suming he came of a good home in which he had been inculeat-
ed with honor, honesty, a conscience and self-respect.”

The only way a man can ever unknowingly attain immor
tality is for him to instill some measure of what he humbly con-
siders ethically valuable amongst others about him.

Pulling Out Of A Crash Dive

Last week we sat in the Executive Committee's meeting

room and listened as Mock Convention Chairman Dan Sil-
berberg presented a plea to that body for more money. $600 to
be exact. And that was, according to Silberberg, “sort of a
loan.

Last year we sat in the same room and listened as Mr.

Silberberg went begging to the EC for $200 to defray the cost
of what he then termed plans for summer mailings by state
chairmen for the 1972 Mock Convention. And yet no mailings
were made. In fact, at this very moment, Mr. Silberberg has
only 30 state chairmen working for him. And he needs money
again for mailings he said he was going to make last year
What concerns us is that if the EC does not thoroughly re

Mr

Convention is allowed to rock along as it apparently has in the

view Silberberg’s activities so far, and the 1972 Mock
past, there may as well be no Mock Convention in 1972 be

Logan Discusses Exchange

Hollins: ‘Pint-Sized University?’

BY LAWRENCE McCONNELL
and
MACK WOODWARD

(Editor’s Note: This article is the
second in a series of interviews with
administrators in various colleges
participating in the exchange pro-
gram. Dr. Logan, President of Hol-
lins College, is a graduate of Yale
University. Dean Wheeler is Dean
of Academics at Hollins College.)

The Ring-tum Phi: Why did Hol-
lins decide to enter into the ex-
change program with the other
schools? :

President Logan: Well, | suspect
that all of us had similar reasons
for doing it: we wanted, for
thing, to take advantage of the var
iety of academic experiences that
the eight schools offer. We're not all
identical by any means. There are
things to be had in some places that
aren't had in others

And we never expected the ex-
change program to be entirely co

educational: it's perfectly

one

possiblc

for a man to go to another men’s
school or a girl to go to another
girl's school. It has turned out, in

co-education
each of us a

any case, to be largely
al, and it has
glimpse of co-education, which has
been one of its advantages

R-¢ Phi: But there was no thought
in mind that one day Hollins would
go co-educational?

Logan: I don't think there isn't a
single this that
isn't considering the

some degree or

given

college in group
question to

simply be

cause no one knows what the prefer

another

ences of the college generation are
going to be from now on. It
possible We
pen that there
for the unisex college

So while I don't think
question is so intimately
with the exchange
back of all of
may
there's no

may be
hope it doesn't hap
may be no room
im the future
that th
connected
idea, its in the
our minds, that we

' '

have to go co-educational

  

chentele for the si
scx college

Dean Wheeler: | think
to say that no one saw
toward

this as
co-education is a Way We
sneak

rome

can sort of nio co-education

Rather
we wel really
whether i

than co-educationa

irying to tes ao

was possible for a wo
i

mans college to

remain a womans

but offer certain of its pro-
grams to men.

Logan: We don't intend to change
our curriculum.

R-t Phi: Dean Wheeler, do you
think that the exchange program
will continue in the future?

Wheeler: | have every expecta-
tion; we would like to see it grow
considerably. Let me elaborate on
one point the President made a
moment ago, and that’s in regard to
broadening the academic opportuni-
ties and at the same time enjoying
certain economics. With all of these
institutions together, you have 2
“pint-sized university.” Now we're
all trying to offer as broad a pro-
gram as possible; I think we can
move toward some degree of speciali-
zauion,

college,

For example, the bio-chemical
facilities. I think there is no need
for more than one real good facility
in the set-up, but if all of us try to
that, it is terrifically expen-
sive. So actually, this exchange pro-
gram may work into a very regular
of thing where students with
specific needs might simply move to
the institution that offers those facil-
ities for that sort of experience.

R-t Phi: Dr. Logan, have you
noticed any trend in applications
that would have caused you to loox
into co-education?

Logan: | think that every small,
liberal arts, private college has ex-
perienced some decline in the num-
ber of applicants since the peak in
the mid-Sixties. Of course, the popu-
lation has leveled off, too, and you
couldn't expect a definite increase.

Wheeler: The applications for next

‘fer

sort

year that are already in for next
year are significantly ahead of Iasi
year ina very important category

early decision.

For example, last year | guess we
had 66 early decision students in all:
as of Friday (25 September) we had
72 with a week to go until the dead-
line

R-t Phi: I've noticed that at other
schools, including WAL, this year’s
freshman class has increased in size,
while applications have decreased
Has this been due to a monetary fac
lor or were enough students qualified
or did you have the room and could
expand?

Logan: We've had

a phased in-

 

crease over the past three years, an!
we've had the space after acquiring
the Hollins apartments. We antici-
pate a slight increase again nexi
year when we have more of the
apartments available.

R-t Phi: In what we've ascertained
so far in interviews, co-education as
a 50-50 ratio is not going to help
the small, private unisex college.
I'm sure it would cost too much.

Logan: We have a study coming
out this year which deals with the
contingency planning of such an
operation. .. . Of course, if you're

about endowment,

talking
talking about money like {$15 mil
lion),

Wheeler: It's not a simple econo-

you re

mic question. If those men come
here and are interested in the same
things that are popular with women,
we're going to be worse off with th:
men than without them. We will not
be exploiting the staff we have, but
we may be forced to add staff to
ake care of the increased wort
load.

The question facing the small, li-
beral arts education may be in co
education in the short run, but is
really, in the long run in financing
this kind of education. I'm sure that
this college or any college can go on
Operating on the same fiscal base
as it has in the past, depending pri
marily on student needs. Something
else has to be phased into the

tem. Probably what we need is for
the government to think of subsidiz-
ing the individual rather than the in-
stitution, and let the market forces
play, and if the private schools are
better than the public, so much the
better—or the other way around.

R-t Phi: What about the possibility
of having one sink fund for the eight
schools on the exchange program,
and letting one man—Financial Di
rector or whatever—go out and soli-
cit donations, contributions, scholar-
ships, etc. to be divided among
these eight schools. Has that possibil-
ity ever been considered?

Logan: Not yet, in our discussions
This has happened in other places
certain kinds of coordinated organi-
zations. It’s perfectly conceivable
that this could happen. That's not
part of anybody's real plan. There

Lee:
A Legend
Or An Archaic

Anachronism?

BY ROMULUS WEATHERMAN
Director of Publications

Is Robert E. Lee in this year of 1970—the
1undredth anniversary of his death—an ana-
‘hronism? A sophisticated society that exalts
he anti-hero might say so. It is true that the
egend-makers have tended to distort Lee by
naking him the symbol of all the desperate
dealism that once supported the Lost Cause.
Phe poet Sidney Lanier saw Lee gently sleep-
ng at outdoor church services on the Peters-
vurg front and wrote: “Not a muscle of him
stirred, not a nerve of his grand countenance
witched, there was no drooping of the head
ior bowing of the figure... . As he slumbered

so, sitting erect with his arms folded upon his
chest in an attitude of majestic repose such
as I never saw assumed by mortal man before

. it seemed to me as if the present earth
floated off through the sunlight and the anti-
que earth returned out of the past and some
majestic god sat on a hill sculptured in stone
presiding over a terrible yet sublime contest
of human passions.” Much later a clergyman,
standing before the tomb of Lee, broke into
reverential ecstasy: “The greatest man on
earth since the days of St. Paul!” Thus did the
legend take root and flourish so that it is diffi-
cult to separate Lee the man from Lee the
myth,

The mention of his name today often
brings cynical smiles. But the modern depre-
cators of Lee overlook the intense humanity
of the man. Lee in his own mind was anything
but a majestic figure. Lee often yearned for
nothing more than life on a small farm sur-
rounded by the family he loved. He frequent-
ly doubted his ability; he even questioned
whether he was worthy of the grace of God in
whom he so fervently believed. His paramount
virtues were self-mastery and_ self-denial,
which gave his character a near perfection
that some of his closest friends found boring.
But he could no more elude nobility than a
leopard can change his spots. Nobility was in
his nature, his humanity.

How was it that Lee, who was forced to
make a cruel and narrow choice for which
other men in other times might have been
hanged, emerged in the end as a hero rever-
ed by friend and foe? A part of the answer is
that he had no ambition except the conscious-
ness of duty faithfully performed. The two
maxims that summed up his philosophy were
“Do your duty” and “Human virtue should
be equal to human calamity.”

This philosophy he exhibited in full mea-
sure when in 1865 he surprised the trustees of
Washington College by accepting their au-
dacious invitation to become president of
what at war’s end was little more than a few
dilapidated buildings and an honorable name.
Lee the warrior had become Lee the reconcil-
iator. He did not look back. He refused to
sustain the open wounds of war; he sought to
heal them; he devoted his energy and influ-
ence to restoring harmony to a divided na-
tion. He saw in the presidency of Washing-
ton College an opportunity to do what he
could to help rebuild a torn economic and

social order. “I have,” he said, “a self-imposed
task which I cannot forsake.”

Lee’s innovative accomplishments at the
College constituted what has been aptly call-
ed the “Augustan Age” in the history of
Washington and University. It

great orator president, who summed up Lee’s
“Final Achievement” :

Lee was

Che central objective of his administra-
tion was to create and fortify an institution
that would minister to the greatly changed
civilization of his people. Strengthening first
the processes of culture, as the basis of all
true education, he addressed himself to the
new demands. Not in a spirit of pdagogical
experimentation, but with a definite under-
standing of the social order which was to be
developed, he transformed the curriculum of
the ancient classical school.

“Here was a New South that would need
legislation, legal adjustment, legal interpreta-
tion, and Lee added a division of law. Here
was a New South that must see broad utili-
zation of natural resources and emphasis up-
on transportation, and Lee added a school of
engineering. Here was a New South that
would pass at least in part from the agrarian
mode of the plantation to the order of busi-
ness ,and Lee projected a school of com-
merce, probably the first ever planned upon
collegiate levels, though the project waited
many years for its fulfillment. Here was a
New South that required intelligent guidance
in the formulation of public opinion, and Lee
organized a course in journalism.

“The ultimate monument to him is the
University which has now linked his name
with that of Washington in its title. There

Although Lexington’s city fathers
have not scored a multitude of
points with many people recently,
particularly with Washington and
Lee students, they have embarked
on a plan which may spawn an-
other Jim Brown, Alex Karras, or
Johnny Unitas.

The City of Lexington has taken
upon itself to sponsor a little league
football conference consisting of ele-
ven, twelve, and thirteen year old
Four teams play each other

dule. Bach team is complete with
coaching staff, play sets, insurance

sidents volunteer as coaches, and

who prefer to remain
anonymous, agreed that the whole
experience is fun. “It gives us a

| chance to shape values,” said one,
“and provides a tremendous feeling
of usefulness.”

Asked about the success of the
program, one coach predicted, “Some
of these guys could become great
ballplayers. No doubt about it, some
boys out there have tremendous

| potential.”

noon for about an hour and a half,
One of the most important aspects
of the program is that it is biracial.
Although the whites outnumber the
blacks, the teams are mixed in order
to facilitate companionship and
sportsmanship. Tolerance in race re-
lations must begin as soon as man’s
communication with others occurs,

and healthy competition is a con-
cept as old as history.
Currently, the program includes

about 120 boys, thirty to a team.
Unfortunately, the possibilities of
expansion are slim due to the lack of
numbers. Just about every interested
boy in the city is participating. This
leaves two means for expansion. The
league can either begin to take in
boys from the surrounding areas,
(Rockbridge Baths, or even Buena
Vista), or it can expand the age
limit to take in ten year olds, many
of whom already practice in the
afternoons with the big teams, Both
plans have their merits but also their
defects.

rhe teams have all played half of
their six scheduled games and plans
are in the offing for an all-star game,
which means at least one more
month of Saturday morning ball for
the youngsters.

So if any of you find the cartoons
boring and that morning keg stale,
head out to Lexington High School
and watch the kids play—you ma)
may even meet the Washington Red-
skins’ first draft choice of 1980,

Soccer Team Boots Madison, 1-0

BY CURT JAMISON

The Washington and Lee Soccer
Generals finally managed to get on
the board in the win column last
Friday with an imposing 1-0 vic-
tory over Madison College.

Madison, through its concentrat-
ed efforts to build a soccer power,
brought a vastly improved though
still completely outclassed club to
Lexington. It appears to this ob-
server that the Generals have fin-

ally begun to understand the com-
plexities of the basically new 3-3-4
alignment developed by Coach Joe
Lyles this year.

This system is conducive to do-
minant ball control in the defensive
and middle areas of the field. Its
only shortcoming seems to be its
lack of offensive thrust in the for-
ward zone. In order to penetrate
the defensive secondary of the op-
ponent, the center forward in this

3-3-4 alignment must work closely
with his halfbacks rather than with
the insides as in years past. Until
Friday’s game, the W&L halfbacks
had been straying too far into their
own defensive zone, which prevent-
ed them from switching quickly to
ihe offensive after a turnover.

After a scoreless first half which
saw the Generals fire shot after shot
at the Madison goalie the home club
really went to work. The second half

 

Hank Slauson, a capheman, toes ball goalward. The Generals beat Madison 1-0 on Friday.

Two W@L Punts Blocked;
One Returned 72 Yards;
Martin Rushes 101 Yards

BY PETER JONES

Centre College of Kentucky, rid-
ing the back of luck, rolled to a 40-
6 victory over the Washington and
Lee Generals,

As the game began, it looked as
though the Generals were here to
prove they could grind out a con-
vincing offense. After having receiv-
ed the opening kickoff, Centre prom-
ptly fumbled the ball away to Tom
Kent on their own 38  yardline.
Sophomore Steve Fluharty came in
to swiftly guide the Blue in nine
plays to the Centre end zone, capp-
ed by freshman fullback Jim Farrar’s
plunge of 36 inches to score his third
I'D of the season with 11:22 re
maining in the first quarter. The
point attempt was blocked but the
Generals were experiencing their
first lead of the season.

But that didn’t last long. The Gen-
eral defense, contending with tough
Centre rushing backfield and tough
luck, had its work cut out the rest
of the game. Centre took the kick-
off, marched methodically downfield
and tied the score on a 13 yard end
run with 8:02 left in the first quar-
ter. The run for the two-point con-
version was successful and W&L
suddenly found themselves behind
again, 8-6.

The W&L offense couldn't muster
any drive after the kickoff, and Cen-
tre soon found out they had the
same complex as the first quarter
came nearer to a close. Yet, just be-
fore the quarter gun, Centre man-
aged a short but deep drive into Blue
territory and with only :42 gone in
the second quarter, scored on a one-
yard run. The conversion set the
Generals further behind, 15-6.

Still controlling the offense and
the clock, Centre rambled down to
the W&L four and conveniently
completed a TD pass with 5:31 left
in the half. The extra point attempt
was true and the Generals were
looking at a 22-6 deficit.

Fluharty did master a precision
drive down to the Centre 17 yardline
right before the half, but the steam
ran out as did the downs and the
time.

WAL received the second kickoff
determined to come back. The de-
fense magnificiently held the Centre
rushing game, but the offense failed
to capitalize on anything. Punting
midway into the third quarter, the
Generals failed to recognize a burst
of speed and a few fakes and watch

ed Centre’s running back Ely run 72

yards with the ball for a TD with
5:31 remaining in the third quarter.
The conversion run failed; the score
stood 28-6,

Seemingly undaunted, the W&l
offense racked up a 69 yard drive to
the Centre eleven, capped by JoJo
Martin’s 48 yard off-tackle sprint.
As luck would have it, an intercep-
tion in the endzone thwarted yet an-
other drive.

The Blue defense opened the
fourth quarter with a fumble recov-
ery on the Centre 37. Again, after
moving to the 17 yardline, the small
technical rule of four downs to
make a first claimed the drive. The
game was all but too far gone to re-
cover. Centre scored twice again on
runs of one and five yards respec
tively. Both conversions failed and
the score ended 40-6

A Tag Clarification ...

ciyt and county tags. City tags are
required within the limits of Lexing-
ton, and county tags are to be pur-
chased by those whose residences
are outside Lexington.

Freshmen owning cars are requir-
ed to have tags and should purchase
the Lexington denomination, The
only students owning cars who are
exempt from the local tag regula-
tions are those who have tags from

purchased between October 1 and
October 30. Students without tags
are subject to fine after October 30.
