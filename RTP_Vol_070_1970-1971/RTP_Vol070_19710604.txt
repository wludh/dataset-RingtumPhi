A total of 293 bachelor’s and law
degrees were conferred on 290 stu-
dents in commencement exercises at
Washington and Lee.

Following long-standing tradition,
President Robert E. R. Huntley was
the principal speaker and presented
diplomas to each new graduate in
the June 4 ceremonies on the historic
front campus of the University.

Huntley stated during his com-
mencement address that commence-

ment is a “time for looking forward
to the future, rather than back-
ward at the past.”

The President of the University
went on to comment, “It is now
quite clear that no one institution,
no matter how large or how wealthy,
can hope to provide the full range
of choice which our complex civili-
zation must have from its educa-
tional system, and therefore the new
patterns of educationa and new kinds

Farrar Calls Frosh

‘Strongest

The Class of 1975, a group of
incoming freshmen termed by Dean
of Admissions, James D. Farrar, as
“the strongest in recent years,” will
enroll at Washington and Lee in
September. Currently 357 men are
included in the class, a decrease
from the Class of 1974 that entered
the University in September, 1970.

Dean Farrar also noted, however,
that in contrast to a general down-
ward trend of applications to private
schools, the number of applicants
to WAL increased by ten to 1260.
Of these 1260, 800 were offered ad-
mission to Washington and Lee.
Thus 45 per cent of those accepted
chose to come, a decrease of 7 per
cent from last year.

Dean Farrar added that the geo-
graphical distribution of applicants
and actual entering freshmen re-
mained “about the same.” Forty
states will be represented with 20
per cent of the entering class com-
ing from Virginia.

Included in the Class of 1974
are 36 alumni sons. Twelve students
from the Rockbridge County area
are to enroll.

The University will provide $110.-
500 to freshmen through a wide
range of aid programs, according to
Dean William A. Noell Jr., Director
of Student Financial Aid. This is
again a slight decrease from a last
year. Dean Noell added that this
total includes scholarship, direct

U.S. Ambassador to Sweden Jerome
D. Holland, Dr. Daniel Blain of
Philadelphia and Edwin Hyde of
Richmond received honorary degrees
today from Washington and Lee

President Robert E. R. Huntley
conferred the LL.D. degree on Gov
Holton, Dr. Holton and Mr. Hyde
and the D.Sc. degree on Dr. Blain
during commencement exercises on
the university's front campus. Al-
most 300 students received bachelor’s
and law degrees during the cere-
monies.

A 1944 graduate of Washington
and Lee, Holton became in 1969 the
first Republican elected governor of
Virginia since Reconsiruction. Long
active in Republican party politics,
he first ran for governor in 1965,
and was one of Richard Nixon's
earliest and most ardent supporters
in the 1968 Presidential campaign.

After naval service in World War

in addition to them.

“Washington and Lee, in the
future as in the past, will not be
afraid of change. Even in the few
years since you graduating seniors
enrolled, significant changes in cur-
riculum, in student life, and in
methods of governance have been
fashioned with care and undertaken
with confidence. Such changes will
continue to occur and will continue
to be consistent with the basic edu-
cational objectives and ideals of the
school.

 

“In short, then, I believe that
Washington and Lee’s future, ac-
companied by the hard work and
devotion which has been so much a
part of its past, can and will be
a full one, a successful one, a rele-

Washington and Lee Receives $600,000 Grant

A $600,000 grant has been given
to Washington and Lee University by
the William R. Kenan Jr. Charitable
Trust to establish an endowed pro-
fessorship.

Dr. William A. Jenks, head of the
history department and a prominent
authority on modern Austria and
the Habsburg dynasty, has been
named Washington and Lee’s Kenan
professor, University President R.
E. R. Huntley said.

Both announcements came in
Huntley's address during commence-
ment exercises at Washington and
Lee.

In announcing Dr. Jenks’ appiont-
ment to the Kenan chair, Huntley
said the trust wishes “to support a
scholar-teacher of distinction, whose
enthusiasm for learning, commit-

ler and Glenn. He has been a direc-
tor of Roanoke's Fine Arts Center,
vice-president of the Virginia Bar
Association, and president of the
Roanoke chapter of Washington and

In 1960 and again in 1968 he
served as a Virginia delegate to the
national GOP nominating conven-
tions, and served as regional co-
ordinator in President Nixon's 1968
campaign.

Dr. Blain, director of the Penn
sylvania State Hospital in Phila
delphia, professor of psychiatry at
the University of Pennsylvania
School of Medicine and former
president of the American Psychi-
Association, is a fifth-genera-
tion Washington and Lee alumnus,
having earned the B.A. degree in
1921. His son, Daniel Blain, Ir.,
represented the sixth generation
when he graduated from the uni-
versity in 1963

Dr. Blain was born in Kashing
China, and following eraduation
from Washington and Lee took the

aire

ment to teaching, and interest in stu-
dents will make a notable contribu-
tion to the undergraduate com-
munity”—a reflection of Mr. Kenan’s
own intense interest in education.
“The Kenan grant,” Huntley said
in his address, “is an emphatic indi-
cation that intelligent and discern-
ing men, who owe no special al-
legiance to us, share our conviction
in the vitality of Washington and
Lee’s function as a small, high-
quality liberal arts teaching insti-
tution, and wish us to know that
our confidence has been justified.”

of Wilmington, North Carolina, de-

the 27 graduates that the three
problems of discipline, race rela-

important challenges facing armed
services officers today, and a “people
oriented” means of attacking them
rather than a computer-style ap-

The newly designated commander

2 THE RING-TUM PHI

REVIEW and OUTLOOK
Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Friday, June 4, 1971

 

For you soon-to-be freshmen this newspaper is probably
your first glimpse of Washington and Lee. Be forewarned!
A veritable barrage of information is on its way. Before you
succumb to this useless information, give us an opportunity
to answer the question which must be utmost in your minds—
what is W&L like?

Washington and Lee is best characterized by one word—
change. Change is evident across the campus. From a physical
perspective Doremus Gymnasium is gradually approaching
its completion. The new 12-12-6 curriculum, featuring a short
spring term, is being tried for the first time. Students are
enrolling in more and more courses on a Pass-Fail basis. An
increase in female exchange students is foreseen this autumn
at Washington and Lee.

Yes, all the above changes are evident in quantitative or
other concrete forms. But additional changes are better hidden
and more difficult to ascertain. W&L attitudes are changing:
attitudes towards Blacks, attitudes toward the Honor System,
attitudes about student involvement, attitudes about the re-
sponsibilities of Washington and Lee and attitudes about
tradition.

It would be a lie to say there is no racial discrimination
here. But a large contingent of Blacks are enrolled under the
auspices of a sizeable W&L scholarship fund for minority
groups. The Honor System has critics, and the honor court
has recently published a statement endorsing a change in
emphasis for honor cases. Yet, the Honor System in our estima-
tion is largely unique and it works, W&L students seem
growingly unsatisfied with dropping out of the world for four
years while they attend college. Today many men are becom-
ing involved in community projects and political campaigns.
Quite a few students no longer feel W&L is situated atop a
hill separated from themselves and the world. W&L is realiz-
ing its responsibilities to both its students and outsiders and
attempting to fulfill these responsibilities. Indeed, we would
by lying if we said coats and ties are worn to class at Wash-
ington and Lee. Students seem less and less attuned to the
conventional dress tradition. However, the strong sense of
other, more important traditions prevail despite change.

So, we advise you to withhold judgment of W&L for a
while, at least. You see, many entering students have found
Washington and Lee to be either a self-fulfilling dream or a
bitter disappointment. In other words your four year residency
here can be what you desire it to be.

Our campus might become a touchstone for your perpetual
roadtrips to Hollins, Randolph-Macon, Mary Baldwin or Sweet
Briar. And Washington and Lee can provide you with weekly
parties and plenty of drunken stupors. You are certainly able
to make your “gentleman's C’s” and graduate. The opportunity
is here to inner-tube (if we may invent a verb) your life away.

As valuable as those goals might appear, you can get a
bit more out of our institution. You can acquire a high quality
education. You can benefit from a close student-teacher rela-
tionship. You can learn to respect and possibly inherit several
traditions, such as the Honor System, which have been
characterstic of W&L men in the past. You can give of your
time and energy to make your new school a better school,
perhaps even the finest school.

Surely, Washington and Lee over the next few years can
be many things. But enough, returning to our original ques-
tion—what is W&L like—the reply seems clear. W&L can
be what you want it to be, Ponder that thought very carefully.

Greeting From the Presidents

You have probably heard much
about Washington and Lee by now
and have been confused by much
of it. You have probably been told
and have read that there are many
time-honored traditions at Washing-
ton and Lee.

However, the University is chang-
ing, and some of its traditions are
dying. Gone, for the most part is
conventional dress. Also rapidly dis-
appearing, and very regrettably so,
is the speaking tradition. One aspect
of Washington and Lee, however,
has not changed since the days of
Robert E, Lee. That is the Honor
System.

The Honor System, in my opinion,
is the most important single aspect
of Washington and Lee. You are
aware of other benefits of Wash-
ington and Lee I'm sure: the small
classes, excellent faculty, and the
ample opportunities for independent
study. Yet, without the Honor Syst-
tem, none of these conditions would
be here.

The Honor System is not a set
of laws or rules; rather it is a spirit
or atmosphere that dominates the
W&L campus. It is summarized in
the following statement: “A Wash-
ington and Lee student is to conduct
himself as a gentleman in matters
of honor at all times; he is trusted
and assumes the obligation to be
trustworthy.”

The life at Washington and Lee
is dominated by this pact of trust.
Students take unproctored _ tests,
schedule their own final examina-
tions, and can leave their rooms un-
locked without the fear that some-
one will come in and take some-
thing. As a member of the Wash-
ington and Lee community, you will
be expected to uphold and respect
this bond of trust. To do this you
are going to have to start thinking
about it now, and decide how you
feel about it. For it is only if one
is totally committed to the con-
cepts of honor and trust that he
can live and prosper at Washington
and Lee.

Welcome Frosh

No matter how hard one may try
to develop a new approach to the
expression of these welcoming re-
marks, it is difficult and perhaps
undesirable to abandon the fre-
quently recurring theme of mutual
expectations, Your entrance here is
characterized by many such shared
anticipations.

We, of course, cannot know pre-
cisely what your expectations are.
We have done everything possible to
provide the kinds of opportunities
we believe young men who have
elected to come to Washington and
Lee expect to have. Few institutions
combine as fully as this one the
advantages of smallness with a
breadth of curricular and extracur-
ricular offerings. Few offer the
chance for pursuit of the liberal
educational ideal of the whole man
while simultaneously affording you
an opportunity to involve yourself
deeply in areas of your particular
talent and interest.

Our pursuit of this ideal changes
with the times, but the ideal itself
remains constant.

Students here in many ways —
formal and informal — have a large
influence on our ways of deciding
things. You will hear more about
this kind of participation from your
student leaders and from the Dean
of Students.

In general, we expect of you an
intelligent individual pursuit of the
University’s educational ideal and a
thoughtful, responsible acceptance of
the large, and for many of you,
newly-found freedom to regulate
your personal lives. Above all, we
expect you to achieve the hallmarks
of the educated man — _ well-in-
formed judgment, a disciplined habit
of thought, lofty ideals, intellectual
honesty, humility, and tolerance.
Every resource of Washington and
Lee University is committeed to
helping you fulfill such purpose.

Washington and Lee University.
Dear Dr, Doyon,

We have been extremely pleased
with Phil during the brief time he
has been with us, and we hope he
is an example of the high caliber
of students that we can expect from
Washington and Lee in the future,

The Virginia Museum of
Fine Arts”

“Phil” is Philip Beckwith, a senior
from Savannah, Ga. and the first art
major to work under the new Wash-
ington and Lee-Virginia Museum of
Fine Arts museum apprenticeship
program.

In the public note io Dr, Doyon,
the director of the apprenticeship
program in Richmond, William
Gaines, praised him for his work
during the Spring Term in Rich-
mond. In fact, the Virginia Museum
liked Beckwith's work so much that
they've given him a job,

Al a time when major news maga-
zines sich as “Time” proclaim that
this year’s graduating class will be

hard pressed to find jobs, Beckwith
has landed the job of curator of
the museum's new Arimobile on
African Art which will start its tour
of Virginia in September,

The Virginia Museum has just re-
ceived an indefinite, extended loan
on one of the nation’s outstanding
collections on the art of black
Africa. During the summer, Beck-
with will mount the show, and al
the end of a year's practical experi-
ence, he will be recommended for
further training in restoration and
preservation—probably al the Metro
politan Museum of Fine Arts in
New York.

In addition Beckwith's double ma
jor in art and geology should serve
him in work he plans to do in
Savannah, A sizeable section of old
Savannah is being restored al pres-
ent, and he hopes to have a hand
in that restoration in a few years.

He has also been at work on an
antique collection of furniture, the
product of jong searches through
Savannah attics. All he needs now
is to restore an old house as a home
for his furniture,

In behalf of the Interfraternity
Council, [| would like to extend con-
gratulations to all the members of
the Class of 1975 on your accept-
ance to Washington and Lee Uni-
versity and, at the same time, to
welcome you to our academic com-
munity. No doubt your decision to
choose W&L was a difficult one to
make, but it is just one of the
numerous decisions of importance
which you will encounter. Hopefully,
you will find Washington and Lee
to be the institution at which you
will best develop a personality, what-
ever its nature.

Part of that development for many
students at W&L has been fraternity
membership, Next fall, each one of
you will have the opportunity to
determine for yourself whether or
not fraternity life is for you; and
should your decision be affirmative,
you will have the task of choosing
which house is best suited to your
tempehments, talents, and convic-
tions. But during Rush, the Inter-
fraternity Council exists to help all
of you,

lems. Recently, the IFC established

IFC is active in sponsoring social

ducting Rush, probably the most
valuable aspect is the co-sponsor-
ship of Contact in which a series of
noted speakers is brought to Wash-

In conjunction with the upcoming
Rush activities, the IFC publishes
a Rush Booklet which familiarizes
the incoming freshmen on rush pro-
cedures, These booklets, barring any
unforeseen printing delays, will be
mailed in August. I urge each of
you to acquaint yourself with this
booklet, as it answers many ques-
tions for the prospective rushee.

As for what a fraternity does or
can do for you, I cannot say here.
That is a decision which only you
can make, once you have had the
chance to see a portion of fra-
ternity life. The IFC stands ready to
assist you in whatever way possible

him the best of luck.

Since the old saying of “Once
a W&L man, always a W&L man”

“In preparing for this gathering,

Ecology Course Offers

Camping Out For Credit

By RITA ENNIS

Ecology: the relations between
living organisms and their environ-
ments. This is what Webster says,
but students in Biology 371 at W&L
could add much more to that de-
finition,

For them it has meant tents fall-
ing down, ashes in cooked-over-the-
fire food, sore bodies, wet and
smelly clothes and a much better
understanding of their environment

and its problems.

The course in called simply “Eco-
logy” and was offered in the newly-
created Spring Term this year.
Eleven students were enrolled (10
boys and one girl), and they, and
their professor, Dr. Tom Nye, spent
upwards of 24 hours per week in
class room and field activities. The
course has been offered in past
years, but the new short Spring
Term “offered the advantages of

better weather and more time for
field trips,” says Dr, Nye, “so we
switched.”

Students have taken extensive field
trips to West Virginia and Beaufort,
N.C. However, the main source of
field study comes from the local
area: the Blue Ridge Parkway, the
George Washington National Forest,
Cave Springs and North Mountain.

Major concentration for the course
has been placed upon simply under-

standing the features of different
systems of nature, but students have
also learned and observed first-hand
some of the effects of man’s pollution
upon those systems of nature.

The course has proven to be quite
popular among students. The class
was filled before Christmas and there
was a long waiting list. But because
of transportation and camping prob-
lems, the class size was restricted.

In addition to acquiring basic
knowledge, some of the students feel
they have benefited from the course
in other ways. One senior said, “To
be able to drink water from a moun-
tain stream is a great experience. The

Generals’ Athletic Teams
Round Out Sports Year

The 1970-71 intercollegiate sports
year at Washington and Lee is over;
and its success in many ways is
noteworthy. The compiled record of
the twelve intercollegiate sports in
which the Generals participated:
football, cross country, soccer, bas-
ketball, wrestling, swimming, base-
ball, lacrosse, golf, tennis, track, and
rifle; was 66-85-3. For a_ private
institution such as W&lL that has a
total undergraduate enrollment of
1200, offers no athletic scholarships,
and has 23 per cent of the student
body in varsity competition, such a
record is quite amazing.

W&L NCAA

competes, under

supervision, in college division
athletics as part of the College
Athletic Conference (CAC). Four
other universities comprise the con-
Southwestern at Memphis,
Sewanee, Washington University,
and Centre. Against these and other
colleges, the Generals had winning
seasons in four sports: cross country
(7-3), basketball (17-8), swimming
(5-4), and lacrosse (11-2). The round-
ballers, under the direction of coach
Verne Canfield, captured the CAC
championship, along with the swim
team, under Coach Sterns. It was
the twenty-fifth consecutive winning
year for the swimmers. The lacrosse

Generals Place
Five On Roster

Five Washingtun and Lee Univer-
sity lacrosse players have been
named All-American, including first
team selections Bill Brumback and
William (Sam) Englehart.

For Brumback, it was a repeat
performance. Recently voted W&L’s
most valuable athlete, the Baltimore
senior now has ended his collegiate
career by achieving All-America
status six times, four in swimming
and two in lacrosse.

Englehart, a sophomore from
Baltimore, led the Generals in scor-
ing for the past two years. His 45
goals and three assists this year
placed him among the nation’s
leaders.

Midfielder Whit Morrill was named
to the All-American second team.
The Monkton, Md. senior was a
third team choice last year.

Attackman Scott Neese of Ro-
chester, N.Y. and goal-keeper Bill
Ingersoll of Chestertown, Md. were
named on the honorable mention
list. Neese is a junior and Ingersoll
a senior.

All-Division

Five Washington and Lee Uni-
versity lacrosse players have been
chosen for the All-South Atlantic
Division team,

Defenseman Bill Brumback, at-
tackman Sam Englehart and mid-
fielders Skip Lichtfuss and Whit
Morrill were named to the first team.
All are from the Baltimore area.

Goal-keeper Bill Ingersoll of
Chestertown, Md. was named to
the second team.

Neese, a top scorer for the W&L
stickmen for three years, served as
a co-captain this year, when the
Generals enjoyed their best year ever
in lacrosse with an 11-2 record and
a division co-championship.

ed their best season ever with an
11-2 mark.

W&L and Towson placed the most
members on the all-division team
with five apiece. Duke, North Caro-
lina, Baltimore University and Mary-

ranked Cavaliers of Virginia and to
third ranked Navy.

Individual honors abound. In foot-
ball, despite a disappointing 2-7
record, quarterback Steve Fluharty
and receiver Steve Mahaffey made
honorable mention All-Americans in
the college division. Fluharty, a
junior next year, finished seventh in
passing in the nation, while Ma-
haffey, who graduated in January,
grabbed the number one spot in
receiving. Bill Brumback is a four-
time All-American in swimming and
is almost certain to ‘become a two-
time All-American in lacrosse. Whit
Morrill, who graduated in June, is
also an All-American in lacrosse,
and Bill Ingersoll should receive the
same honor. Mike Daniel, last year’s
captain and also this year’s captain
of basketball, was the CAC’s most
valuable player and received second
team Academic All-American.

To aid W&L athletics, a gym-
nasium addition is currently under
construction. According to the new
Athletic Director, Bill McHenry, the
gym should be completed in plenty
of time for the General’s opening
basketball game against Virginia on
December 1 of this year. The new
facilities are outstanding for a school
this size. Mr. McHenry sees the
intramural and intercollegiate con-
flicts as to gym space completely
solved as of September. The elective
Physical Education program will be
expanded.

WAL will also host two tourn-
ments next year; the NCAA college
division swimming championships in
March and the CAC basketball
championship at the end of Febru-
ary. The 2500 seating capacity of
the new gym should accommodate
these meets sufficiently,

With all of W&L’s sports in need
of youth to fill spots vacated by
graduation, Mr. McHenry urges the
entering class of ‘75 to consider
seriously getting involved in athletics.

(Continued from page 2)
perhaps come close to serving their
proper function in our system of
government, we have decided to
eliminate the wasteful display of
theatrics these gatherings have come
to entail.

“Because political conventions
have come to be a true mockery of
the principles this nation was found-
ed on, we have decided to cancel
the usual type of performance. In
its place, we shall conduct, first
with a ballot open to all candidates
and then by a runoff, a primary
election for the entire student body
of Washington and Lee, hoping that
we can set an example for the na-
tional parties in doing this.

“We are attempting to show the
true leadership which George Wash-
ington and Robert E. Lee would
wish us to show. Balloting shall take
place tomorrow. I declare this con-
vention adjourned.”

Well, I can almost hear it. Every-
body’s entitled to one dream.

cisely that same reason.”

He spoke also of the depersonali-
zation of the military brought about
by the computer age: “How do you
talk to punched holes in a computer
card?” he asked.

The services cannot, he stated,
afford to lose sight of the necessity,
never more urgent than now, that
“people talk to people.” The ROTC
program at liberal arts colleges such
as Washington and Lee is essential,
he observed, in filling that function
through the sort of broad education
they provide.

Three undergraduates were pre-
sented two bachelor’s degrees apiece,
both the B.S. and the B.A. at the
commencement exercises. They were
required to meet fully the separate
requirements for each major in each
degree.
