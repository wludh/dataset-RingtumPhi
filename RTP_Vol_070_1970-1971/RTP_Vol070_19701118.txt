On IFC

BY ROBERT LARUE
IFC Vice President

This article is a reply to Roy
Carlton’s statement in the PinPoint
of November 4 concerning the In-
terfraternity Council and the rush
system, I feel that Mr. Carlton mis-
construed several facts and showed
poor and premature judgment.

In the first place, Mr. Carlton
completely misses the main point of
the extended rush period. The pur-
pose of a longer rush is to give fresh-
men the opportunity to study more
fully the various fraternities. On
the other side, a longer rush will
also allow fraternity members a
closer scrutiny of prospective fresh-
men. Hopefully, this fuller acquaint-
ance between freshmen and upper-
classmen will prevent the mutual dis-
enchantment which tends to set in
later. The final result should thus
be a decline in deacivation.

Secondly, Mr. Carlton attacks the
IFC for its failure to come up with
an immediate study of the rush pro-
gram, labelling the IFC’s study “be-
lated and ineffectual.” I am
amazed that Mr. Carlton feels that
a committee can sit down and rap
idly determine the positive or nega-
tive aspects of any rush program.
A committee has been appointed io
study the merits and demerits of the
past rush system. Because of the
study's statistical nature, the final re-
port, which includes recommenda-
tions for certain changes, is not yet
fully finished. The committee is
studying in detail how many fresh-
men each house pledged during eaca
week of rush, in order to determine
an optimum length for the period.
Also under study are many rules and
regulations, particularly those per-
taining to contact between rushers
and rushees. Clearly, an in-depth
study is preferable to a superficial,
haphazard one,

Mr. Carlton's third error is in his
figures. His statement that 58% of
the freshman class pledged a frater
nity was drawn from a list compiled
the day freshmen turned in their pre-
ferential cards, Mr. Carlton was in
formed by the IFC that this was by
no means complete and that further
pledging would be forthcoming. A!
this writing, 64.7% of the freshman
class have pledged a fraternity
Since an additional 12% of those
freshmen who have not as yet pledg
ed have indicated a desire to go
through the deferred rush plan, it is
probable that the 64.7% figure will
increase. For that matter, more than
82% of those who signed for rush
have pledged. I also question Mr
Carlton's alleged “pessimistic pre
dictions” based on the rush figures
The IFC never attempted to make
an official prediction; since M

Committees Report To EC;

BY JOHN ROBINSON
News Editor

A review of courses may be on
the way. The Executive Committee
recommended that the Curriculum
Committee study the feasibility of
such a review at W&L. In other ac-
tion the EC heard reports from other
standing committees and suwhb-com-
mittees concerning their plans for
the future.

Lex McMillan represented the
Curriculum Committee Monday
night. Steve Clement recently resiga-
ed from the committee and MeMil-
lan has served as temporary chair-
man.

McMillan thought the proposed
review of courses should be aband-
oned because “I don't think the com-
mittee can do a decent job. We don't
have the nvanpower and there are
other things that we can do.”

Law Representative Jim Slay not-
ed that a review of courses has al
ready been carried out successfully
in the W&L Law School. Slay add-
ed that the review was based on a
plan used at Hampden-Sydney. The
EC recommended that McMillan in-
vestigate the Hampden-Sydney plan
and see if the committee could con-
duct a similar project.

McMillan went on to elaborate
about some of the projects the Cur-
riculum Committee is considering.
He noted that perhaps the interde-
partmental programs could be better
developed in the future. Also it is a
possibility that professors will not
know when a student is taking 1

be the only person that would have

mittee is also investigating the idea
of expanding the curriculum in the
religion, fine arts and pre-law fields.
After hearing McMillan’s report
of planned action the EC appointed
him as permanent head of the com-
mittee. The vote was unanimous.

Matt Cole came before the EC
representing the Calyx. Cole submit-
ted a list of organizations whose pic-
tures and copy would be paid for
from the student body fund. The list
was approved unanimously.

In the past two weeks a typewriter
belonging to Lex McMillan was sto-
len from the EC Room in the Uni-
versity Center. McMillan is a work-
study student doing administrative
work for the EC. The EC voted 11-0
to allocate $50 to McMillan for in-
surance fees on the typewriter.

Dean William Pusey submitted a
letter to President Fran Lawrence
asking the EC to select a student to
fill the newly approved position on
the Courses and Degrees Committee.
The letter emphasized that the stu-
dent should be above average aca-
demically and interested in academic
affairs. Vice President Phil Thomp-
son recommended that applications
be sought from interested juniors to
fill this position. Thus, anyone meet-
ing the previously mentioned quali-
fications who can meet with the com-
mittee every Tuesday from 2:30-
4:00 p.m. should present an applica-
tion including their grade point ratio
to Rich Murray before Monday. All
applicants should attend the EC

On The Business Of W &L’s Future...

(Editor’s Note: The Ring-tum Phi has de-
voted its entire second page this week to a
revealing interview which was conducted on
October 12 with Mr. Farris Hotchkiss, Di-
rector of University Development, and Mr.
Sanford Doughty, Associate Director of Uni-
versity Development.

In concluding our four part series on the
future of small private colleges in the immedi-
ate area, ‘we hope that the reader will take
careful note of the problems which the Uni-
versity Development office faces for the 1970's,
Mr. Hotchkiss and Mr. Doughty discussed at
great length the University’s budget, the ef-
fects of the campus disturbance last May
upon alumni, the possibility of coeducation,
and, primarily, the University’s future.

We thank these gentlemen for their valu-
able time and patience in conducting this in-
terview. We urge your interest and ‘we invite
your comments.)

The Ring-tum Phi: I'd like to start with
some questions about development budget.
Has the budget for this year been cut at all,
and, if so, in what areas?

Farris Hotchkiss: Let me first answer that
with a disclaimer. First of all, I'll say no, The
budget has not been cut. Secondly, the real,
authoritative source for that is the treasurer,
and I hesitate to answer that question for
him, which is what I'd essentially be doing.
But let me just point out one thing here:
there are two ways to look at the answer.
One way would be to look at what is the re-
quested budget. In other words, let’s say your
department wants $50,000 more than you had
last year, and Mr. Whitehead and the trus-
tees who serve on the budget committee come
back after a while and say, “All we can do
next year is give you $10,000 more than we
gave you in prior years.”

Well, it all depends on how you look at it.
Is that a cut budget, or isn’t it? In absolute
terms, our budget is greater for next year by
a healthy amount than it was last year. We
have budgeted to spend $5.4 million for this
academic year. Last year, our budget was $5.2
million. So, in other words, we've increased
the budget around $200,000, or about five per
cent.

Now, it’s true that this is not as large a
planned budget increase as we have been
able to plan in some prior years. And that de-
finitely, beyond any shadow of doubt, reflects
the squeeze. There's no doubt about that.
But no, we haven't had to cut the budget

R-t Phi: Well, now, have any specific areas
or departments been cut in the sense of being
budgeted less this year than last?

Hotchkiss: That probably has happened,
though not so much from the standpoint of
our having to arbitrarily cut back, but any
kind of budget reflects current needs. Some
departments had bigger needs last year than
they do this year, so I think that if you take
department by department, you might find a
few who had, in total, a less amount of money
appropriated to them this year than they did
last year. But | think that this is a reflection
of some peak or very pressing needs that can
bulge a budget one year and are not there the
next. It is my understanding that in terms
of what I guess you could call “normaley”
there have been no normal budgetary cuts
Let's say you have the English department,
for example, which has no huge project going
on this year, and has to be told, “We're sorry,
but you're going to have to do without one
professor this year.”

Now, that’s the kind of budget cuts which
many colleges are having to make, and which
we've avoided, On the other hand, | know of
some departments which had to make some
purchases last year which are one-time ex
penses, and their budget is not as large this
coming year as it was last year, for that

reason

R+t Phi: Proceeding from that into de
velopment itself, last year, during May, we
had a little bit of trouble. Would you care to
put a figure on the amount of money that we
might have lost due to that?

Hotchkiss: No, it would be just imposs
ible. You have to ask yoursell, when you say
“lost,” over what period of time have you lost
it, if you lost it at all? For instance, | know of
a large gift
that he’

one man who was considering
to the
having second thoughts

Lniversity who says now

He hasn't said that

he won't give it to us, and | don't know i he

will or not. It goes back to the “whether he
wants to or not” idea. Another example: we
have received about four letters from persons
who say that they had us in their wills and
have taken us out. Whether it was for a dollar,
or a million, we have no way of knowing. We
have an idea it’s not a million, but whether it
be $5,000 or $15,000, we can’t know. So, all 1
can do is to deal in generalities, and my gen-
eral answer to this is: it has cost us money,
because it has—at least for the present—rais-
ed in the minds of many of the people who
support us, some reasonable doubts as to the
permanency of the situation here.

You know, generalities are always the
most dangerous things in the world, and are
always so unfair to their extremes. But I
would say, if I had to generalize, that our
family, so to speak, (a) thought that the
whole situation in May was handled well.
They were sorry it happened. But (b) they
don’t want it to happen again. In other words,
it falls in the category of “you had an unfor-
tunate thing happen. Since it happened, you
handled it all right. In fact, you handled it
better than all right. You did a good job. But
let’s not let it happen again.” Now, believe
me, that’s a generalization. | could quote you
chapter and verse of some notable exceptions.
But I'd like Sandy to get in on that, too, since
he’s been here long enough, and he’s gotten
some feel on the thing.

Sanford Doughty: | would say that it’s
dangerous to generalize for any one reason. I
am certain that in the minds of some indivi-
duals who may never say so to us, they were
hurt by the events of last May. But, they
might have been hurt by something else, too.
This we'll just never know, just what made
them decide. There are so many things which
can make a person decide not to make a gift,
and it’s usually not any one factor.

Ile may be upset because his son, or some
other alumnus’ son wasn't taken, or because
at the moment the market is down, and he’s

 

got a paper loss and doesn't want to give
right now, or because of what he thinks is a
tendency on the part of the faculty to be too
We don't know,

and I'd say that it is dangerous to over gen-

liberal or too conservative

eralize. Actually, | think there are statistics
to support the idea that, by and large, mat-
ters such as student dress and student hair
and student political action really had not had
any major effect on the matter of gifts to col-
leves

on the other hand, there isn't any doubt
but that the higher cost of everything we buy
has affected our ability to balance the budget
\lso, the mere fact that as the cost of living
goes up, and with teachers in great demand,
our salary scale for professors has to go up to
keep them happy. Otherwise, they can very
qptnie kly look around and pick an offer trom
another college, where they are willing to pay
a little more. We pay very well, and it also is
true that Lexington is a heck of a nice place to
live, with a number of advantages which tend

who cuts the grass more money, or else he'll
go to a plant over in Buena Vista.

R-t Phi: Is this increase in the budget due
to our ability to enlarge and include more, or
is it due to a lot of costs?

Doughty: | suspect that a great deal of it
is simply a matter of costs. I can’t speak with
authority on this, but my guess will be that
there has not been any significant reduction
of staff on the college payroll. The payroll
goes up as the standard of living increases.
We have to be competitive, to a certain ex-
tent. This is one thing on which you can gen-
eralize: that costs go up, and you have to
meet them.

But, as regards the school, I'm very opti-
mistic about the school’s future. Not only
Washington and Lee, I'm optimistic about
a kind of switch in direction in the whole stu-
dent population in colleges all across the
country. I feel that students have just about
had it, and they're going to try something
else.

Hotchkiss: | hope you're right.

R-t Phi: It would be correct to assume that
you've been queried quite a bit about what
changes student life has undergone?

Hotchkiss: Sure. You know, when you
talk about W&L,

class by ourselves. There's a lot expected

were something of a
of us other than delivering a good education
Referring again to the University “family,”
the expectations concerning this school, in
terms of what does and doesn't occur here, |
think run a great deal higher than they do at
others, Generally, speaking, we are not ex-
pected to deliver just English, math, history,
ete. There's much, much more expected of us
than that. I don’t mean to say that we're look
ed on as a “finishing school,” but to a certain
extent our alumni, the parents of the boys
here now, and others really do expect that the
product comes out with more than just a
sheepskin. The men are expected to learn
something of the totality of growing up

R-t Phi: What would be the attitude if
we had a totally revised honor system, a book
with lots of rules and guidelines? And if in
stitutions like W&L fraternities go?

Hotchkiss: Well, that’s a hard question to
answer, Of course, this is already happening
and we're already having to work around it
so it at least won't be a new job, If we wound
up with no personal code—and I believe very
trongly in the code—we'd be in troubk ;

R-t Phi: Getting back to just what you's
said, though, how do you say “We're just in
the education business” to the alumni and
other sources of funds?

Hotchkiss: You don’t wet around it, first
of all. You have to live with it, and the best

that vou can expect to do is to base our <« ‘

on the fact that what vou still do. vor at
probably doing better than any other com
prt ible in tittitton That doen't me int the re

revit to like if thetigl

 

You know, if you go out talking to alumni,
you'll find during the question-and-answer
period, rarely will anyone stand up and say,
“Just how good is our sociology depart-
ment?” Usually, they will ask the same sort
of questions that you have been asking: what
are student attitudes, how do the other alum-
ni feel, and so on,

R-t Phi: What are our prospects for long-
range fund raising?

Hotchkiss: | think those prospects will
continue to be quite good. However, if at that
time we have lost our great extra contribu-
tion, you should question whether we ought
to remain small and expensive.

R-t Phi: About the gymnasium
construction somewhat,
much more money do we need to finish it?

Hotchkiss: About $2 million.
R-t Phi: This is just something we'v«
heard, but following the resignation of Mr.

now that

has slowed how

Corrigan, were not the plans of the gym al
tered to fit his needs?

Hotchkiss: No, not at all. | can be unequi-
vocal about that, since the plans to the gym
were virtually finished before he even came
here. One thing | remember though: when he
got here, he saw the handball courts and the
squas courts and he thought they could be
combined, Now, Gene is very big on physical
therapy, and I remember he wanted that area
beefed up. What I'm getting at is there'd be
no way to read into his leaving the fact that
he wasn't satisfied with the physical structure
as planned,

R-t Phi: Do you have any funds to build
the library with yet?

Hotchkiss: About a million dollars

R-t Phi: Specifically for the library:

Hotchkiss: Yes.

R-t Phi: How much money do you think
youll need?

Hotchkiss: Well, it's just a guess right
now, but we've been looking at libraries and
thinking whether they are qualitatively and
the kind of
and they cost $4.5 million or so

R-t Phi: Do you have any offhand ligrure

much coeducation would cost us in

terms of physical needs such as dormitori

an expanded faculty in certain areas, and so
on?

Hotchkiss: Here again, I'm not the best
person to answer that question. But $3 mil
lion has been bandied about as a possible
hgure

R-t Phi: How about the alumni? Have they

been sounding you out on the question of co

_ Jones, Brymesser, Reply

To the Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

I would first like to apologize to
Mr. Craig Jones for any slur upon
his ethical standards. I would sec-
ondly like to apologize to the three
winners of the freshman elections.
1 would thirdly like to apologize to
Pi Kappa Alpha. I am not apologiz-
ing because my position has chang-
ed, but because it has been misunder-
stood.

My intent in writing the letter of
two weeks ago was not simply to
sling mud at a frat or at any par-
ticular person. It was intended as
an elucidation of what I felt to be a
disturbing situation. In doing so, I
presented the results of an informal
poll of freshmen. After Jones’ re-
mark was mentioned to me, I found
myself unable to glean information
by any means other than simply ask-
ing freshmen at random if they no-
ticed anything unusual during the
runoffs. This was accomplished by
simply asking someone (in the Co-
op, library, gym, etc.), “Aren't you
a freshman?”, etc. Unfortunately I
did not write down the names of the
people I polled. Perhaps this is not
what Mr. Jones calls “proper re-
search”, and perhaps it is what Mr.
Brymesser calls “hearsay,” mever-
theless it produced the surprising in
formation which I reported two
weeks ago. | will easily agree that
I may have overreacted in the man-
ner in which I brought the subject
to light, but then I think that Mr.
Brymesser and I have that in com-
mon.

Jones’ alleged remark, for ex-
ample, was quoted simply as an ex-
ample to support my point. It has

Qn in Nal ghana

been taken as a personal assault,
and I can readily see why. I am sin-
cere in saying that I did not intend
it as such. Just as Mr. Jones did not
intend to be serious when he made
the remark... .

I have been asked to name my
sources. After reading my second
paragraph you can see (as I'm sure
Mr. Brymesser will, to his ecstatic
glee) that I cannot. Mr. Jones, how-
ever, can. Not only did he make the
remark in question, but he has a
good idea of whom he said it to.
During the EC meeting of Novem-
ber 9, Tom Mays whispered to
Jones, “Do you have any idea who
you could possibly have made that
remark to?” Answer: “Yea, I think
it was Brian Howard.” That's right,
Mr. Jones. Now, I can readily ac-
cept that the remark was made ia
jest. I lived next door to Craig for
nine months last year and I know
that he likes to kid around a lot. I
am sure that the remark was intend-
ed to be humorous. But my concern
is that the remark was, in fact, taken
seriously, and could also have been
taken seriously by anyone within
earshot. It should not have been
said at all.

Now, as to Brymesser ...

First, | never contended that one
frat forced others to vote in a par-
ticular way. I said that it wielded a
strong, direct, influence in the elec-
tions. I maintain that.

Secondly, I have presented what
I feel is the most important name.
I sincerely hope he will not be
dumped upon simply because he was
the object of an unfortunate, ill-
timed jest.

Thirdly, I will agree, and many
people in the past two weeks have
told me, that members of PiKA were
not the only ones around the polls.
The EC also realized this, and pass-
ed a resolution of apology for its
laxness.

Fourthly, | have checked my stats
and found that Faulkner did have a

fairly large lead after the primaries.
I seem, however, to notice the lack
of a really substantial lead in the
other two cases. The remark about
the abilities of the winners was not
intended as a sarcastic slur, but
could have been read that way by
anyone looking for sarcasm.

Fifthly, I did not offer Mr. Jones’
remark as proof by itself of “strong-
anming.” It was merely an incident
paralleling the thesis of the letter.

Finally, | would suggest that in the
future Mr. Brymesser use facts as
constructive criticism, and not opi-
nioned frothings and false accusa-
tions as carefully aimed invectives.

I think that’s enough said. My
purpose was to draw something con-
structive out of an admittedly sticky,
heated situation. The EC embodied
that “something constructive” on
November 9.

About W&L’s Future...

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

The editorial seen in the Novem-
ber 11, 1970 issue of The Ring-tum
Phi—a deep, detailed, definite ex-
position of the plight of the Trouba-
dour Theatre, et. al.—is deserving of
visibly expressed reaction resulting
from the editorial’s energy and real-
ity.

A university of this size (approx.
1400), a university of this nature
(quiet, qua academic), and a univer-
sity of this calibre (7) now confronts
a growing paradox. As a private in-
stitution—dependent upon its alum-
ni and its recruiting propaganda—it
is forced to offer physical pleasures.
Thus, replacement of Doremus Gym-
nasium with something bigger and
better. And/or as a small, liberal
arts site of “higher learning”—faced
with an increase (hopefully) in in-
tellectuality—it should offer the pro-
per routes to assimilation of that in-
tellect with the arts and skills of the
“real world.” Thus, needs such as an

improved theatre, an expanded fine
arts program, increased publications,
etc., etc., etc., in addition to the ex-
tent facilities.

The individual who attends but a
single performance in the Trouba-
dour Theatre is forced to recognize
the limitations, imposed by the phy-
sical plant, upon the increasingly
creative art. The student, professor,
or administrator who has something
that he believes to be worthy of pub-
lic statement notes with dismay the
lack of media. The potential artist
(or merely the interested person)
who seeks the opportunity to develop
(or explore) his talent feels distant
from the university’s concern when
cramped in a small studio that is al-
most off-campus.

These examples are but slight rep-
resentations of the total needs, With-
in a year the student body will have
ample space to undertake physical
exercise—not to mention God's
green earth. There will be comfor-
table settings from which to observe
basketball, swimming, wrestling. And
yet the student will wait (at present
estimates) another ten years for the
now-needed library. He will wait
(there is no estimate) for an adequate
auditorium in which to hear guest
speakers, to participate in sympos-
iums. He may wait until Newcomb
Hall crumbles to have a satisfactory
(and safe) building to house the de-
partments of commerce and politics.

Still, the needs themselves are sec-
ondary, for they are the ends. The
means are essential to the attain-
ment of those things physical (yet, 1s
a result, intellectual); and, hence,
the more are primary. And suppos-
edly (or evidently—due to the obvi-
ous lacks) the means are unknown—
or unavailable.

And yet they are available for the
athletic plant.

Perhaps there is an excuse. Per-
haps the funds received in such large
amounts capable of providing a new

THE RING-TUM PHI

  

On The Honor System

BY ROBERT BAROODY

The following are simply “mark-
ings on honor.” Because my ap-
proach is mystical, wonderfully il-
logical, and impractical (what about
the alumni?), I have chosen to ex-
press these thoughts under numeri-
cal headings. The only thread con-
necting these headings is the word,
honor.

1) A basic idea. Honor, the word,
is often confused by W&L students
with The Honor System. To say that
an honor code exists is not to say
that there is honor.

2) The honor cycle. When man
realizes that his sense of honor has
become a code, then it is in trou-
‘ble; when honor is actually codified
and symtematized, it begins to die;
when people want to readjust the
code, it is dead.

3) How does one get to be honor-
able? Is there a systematic learning
process involved?; or rather is honor
gained in some sort of initiation-
event? Can honor be assumed? for
four years?

4) One can infer from Mr. Raetz’
late column (“Can you change
thonor?”) a liberal-conservative pola-
rity, in which a man of a certain
political and social leaning is less
likely to be “honorable.” Am I mis-
taken in this interpretation? In any
case, Mr. Raetz betrays his insen-
sitivity by continually stereotyping
a group of people as the “Now
Generation.”

5) Robert Graves defines honor as
“the sense of your correct relation-
ship to your immediate surround-
ings, including your fellow workers.
It’s your duty to your clan or crowd
if you belong to one.”

6) Honor, as a social value, has

Page 3

  

always been characteristic of men
living in a closed system, a carefully
structured society. Legends from the
Medieval era tell of a hero who
could posit any given situation or
personage within a black and white
value system. Robert E. Lee was one
of the last men in this country who
qualified as honorable within the
context of his society. The Confeder-
ate Camelot had been demolished
and its black and white (no pun)
value system was forever replaced
by “gray” variables,

7) At Freshman Camp, the EC
representative easily explained that
lying to a date was not a violation of
the honor code. Why not!? If a man
is encouraged to be im or ammoral
when concerned with such vital
things as love and sex, then what
good is an honor code? Is honor a
five-day-a-week proposition at W&L?

8) Why must an evaluation of
honor be a social one? Certainly we
live in a community; but we do not
behave as a community. It is at the
University, more than any other
place, where different ideas and con-
flicting indiivdual purposes are tol-
erated, indeed nourished.

9) The Honor System, as it now
exists, is nearly worthless and it
should be destroyed. All traces wip-
ed out. If, at a future date, students
realize a sense of community, then
let them set up their own honor code
as a means of articulating communal
ideals. Until this occasion, applicants
to W&L should be limited to men
who agree to adhere to their per-
sonal definitions of the words “gen-

tleman” and “honorable.” Intricate

machinery and checks of fear cannot
apply to honor; it must ultimately
depend upon personal integrity.

This type of thing ought to wait
until the end of the year, when the
other lists of All-Something teams
hit the presses, but after ten weeks
or more of countless televised games,
I think I can choose a team of my
own. My All-Brand X team consists
of some of pro footballs most over-
rated players.

But first, I'd like to introduce the
Head Coach, Joe Kuharich, who ‘s
famous not only for his work with
the Philadelphia Feebles but also
at Notre Dame, where he is the only
Irish coach with a losing record,

The All-Brand X Team

Front Four manned by Jim Reily
and Ben Davidson on the ends and
Dick Arnt and Houston Antwine at
tackles. Reily has yet to catch th:
opposing quarterback behind the line
of scrimmage, and Davidson is of
one of the football’s hardest hitters,
especially when the man is down.
Doug Bufone, Myron Pottios and
Ted Hendricks hold down the line-
backing positions. Hendricks, known
as the “Mad Stork” during his col-
lege days at Miami of Florida, has
had the “mad” replaced with “bad”
by Baltimore fans.

But the gem of the team is the de-
fensive backfield. W. K. Hicks is
one of the greatest when it comes to
playing “Oops, I slipped” and Char-
lie Stucks is, well, Charlie Stucks.
Ricky Harris and Earsell Mackbee
complete the Foursome. Mackbee
was recently cut by Minnesota be-
cause of the clothes he wears.

But a team is not a true champion
without its specialists. The All-Brand
X placekicker is Lou “The Toeless”
Michaels, the punter is Donny An-
derson, and the punt return men ar>
Ricky Harris and Homer Jones. An-
derson leads the league in tackling
punt returner, thanks to a miniscule
34 yard average. Harris and Jones
are the perfect pair; the latter can
find more colorful ways to fumble,
while the former can find more ways
to go backwards, than anyone else in
the league.

That finalizes my All-Brand X
team, but if I left your favorite out,
don’t despair, because he's probably
not worth the recognition anyway.

Tarheels Topple
Ruggers, 10-3

The W&L rugby team closed out
its most successful season last week,
dropping a hard fought contest
the University of North Carolina A
team. The only other loss of the sea-
son came aaginst Virginia Tech in
the season opener.

The contest at Chapel Hill was
marred by the irresponsible absence
of some of the first string ruggers,
however, the reserves filled in ad-
mirably, and at the half the Tarheels
led by 10-3. During the second half
U.N.C. began to use its talent to
good effect and W&L was hard
pressed most of the period. Defea-
sive efforts by fullback Fred Fletch-
er and scrummers Charlie Brown
and George Gautsch saved the score
from being worse.

En route to their 5-2 season the
ruggers defeated Hampden-Sydney,
Lynchburg, University of North
Carolina, and in their biggest and
most impressive win over U.Va.

Season standouts were backs Chris
Murray, Tom Baker, and Dave Gu’
hrie. Standouts in the scrum includ-
ed captain Al GaNun, who played
with injuries most of the season,
Sandy Snead, and Charlie Ross. Also
of note was the kicking of Fletcher
who missed only three conversion at-
tempts during the whole season.

The spring rugby schedule will be-
gin March 7 when the team takes on
Duke and will include American
University, Georgetown, Princeton,
Univ. of North Carolina, Univ. of
Virginia, George Washington, Vir-
ginia Tech and conclude with the
famous Washington and Lee rugby
tournament featuring schools from
all along the East coast,

VMI Athletic Department
Not In Financial Crass

BY WALT BRANSFORD and
PALMER TRICE

As I perused last Wednesday’:
Richmond Times-Dispatch, I ran
across an article entitled “WMI Ath-
letics Near Financial Collapse.” The
first thing that I wondered was,
where was the famed Spirit of VMI?
After reading the article, I realized
that it had died a slow, but sure
death. If the Keydets esprit de corps
had whispered its swan song, how
long before Mom, apple pie, and
the girl you left behind would fol-
low? For the answer to this riddle,
I turned to VMI Athletic Director
Tom Joynes.

Mr. Joynes summed up the truth
in Mr. Lindquist’s claims in one
word: “fraud.” VMI athletics is not
about to fold. Although a $50,000
deficit is predicted for this year, the
program will continue to operate on
a Reserve Fund, that had been creat-
ed solely for such an occasion, At
the present moment, this fund con-
tains about $100,000.

The VMI athletic situation is this.
the school depends entirely on the
football program for the support of
the athletic department. Due to the
Keydets’ poor showing of late, this

support has been dwindling. While
the football is profitable, it still lacks
enough to pay for the rest of the
sports. The solution to these finan-
cial problems would apparently be a
winning football team. Then, why
don’t they fire Coach Vito Ragazzo?

This would not solve the prob-
lem. Ragazzo’s team participates in
a league which he, at present, is un-
prepared to cope with. At this time,
VMI offers far fewer football schol-
arships than any other school in the
Southern Conference. Ragazzo is
giving only 15 to 20 a year. He needs
30, but he lacks the needed finan-
cial support. Who should be giving
this support? The Sports Club, which
is a branch of the VMI Alumni As-
sociation. The infinite circle returns
to lack of support from the Old
Grads. Where is that famed Spirit
of VMI?

The purpose of this article was to
explain our neighbor’s economic
straits. They do not wish to de-em-
phasize their athletic program, yet
they lack the finances to continue it
at its present level for an extended
amount of time without more sup-
port. While UGF can extend their
deadline, Tom Joynes can’t. Support
your local VeeMees.

BY PETER JONES

The Washington and Lee Gen-
erals closed out a disappointing sea-
son last week by dropping their rain-
drenched finale, 17-13, to the Bears
of Washington University.

Despite the continued success of
the nationally ranked passing com-
bination, Steve Fluharty to Steve
Mahaffey, the Generals followed
with plenty of the mistakes that have

though, Washington cranked up an
offensive that began on their own
25 yard line after a punt. With most
of the yardage gained on the ground
and on costly W&L penalties, they
moved to a first and goal on the
five. It took four attempts from that
spot to overcome a determined Gen-
eral defense. The score came from
one yard out with 11:17 left in the
first half and the PAT gave Washing-

their composure on the sloppy field
as they next generated a drive from
the Washington 37 after a_ short
punt. Steve Mahaffey caught half of
his total receptions on this drive,
the final one down to the one yard
line. JoJo Martin plunged for the
score. Doug Chase’s kick was true
and the score evened, 7-7, at half
time.

attempted 40 passes,

W&L received the opening kick-
off and moved with minimal pro-
gress, mainly because of field con-
ditions. After a punt, Washington
countered with a sustained drive that
almost made one doubt the muddy
field could hamper any type of of
fensive. After only 3 minutes of
play, Washington had penetrated to
the Blue 11. A stiff defense forced
a field goal attempt of 30 yards,
which fell short and wide. The first
quarter continued to show both
teams controlling the ball well, both 10,

both teams during the third quarter.
But just before the period’s end
Washington received a punt on their

they met resistance on the W&L 34

kicker attempted an almost impos-
sible 41 yard effort that crawled
over the cross bar. The field goal

victory, and the Generals trailed

Who Said Sure Bets Never Lose?

\nother weekend of football has passed,
and there are some of us who bet on the
games that are less than happy with the re-
sults. Take me, Seeing the
chance to make a big killing this weekend, |
put together all my resourcefullness and came
up with some sure bets: UCLA over Wash-
ington, Auburn over Georgia, Stanford over

for instance.

\ir Force, and Oregon over Army. Nice gape.
[went O for 4, lost all my money and my con-
fidence besides. Actually, I can do without
the confidence, but not having the money
bothers me a little.

The Heisman Trophy race appears to be a
runaway. That is, every time someone is seri-
ously considered as a candidate, he appears to
run away from it. Manning, the pre-season
favorite, didn’t look too sharp the first half of
the season, losing to Southern Miss. Still wor-
ried about receiving the trophy, Archie left no
doubt about his feelings toward it by inten-
tionally breaking his arm. This seemed to
leave Jim Plunkett in the forefront, but Plun
kett, realizing what Manning was trying to
do to him quickly retaliated by throwing the
\ir Force game last Saturday. Steve Worster
of Texas seems (incredulously) to actually
want to win the damn thing, but reliable
sources report no—he’s just waiting until the
‘Texas-Arkansas game so he can blow it, when
it really counts. Notre Dame’s Theisman is
planning to give away the LSU game the
Saline day.

So who is left? There are a few others (not
to be named here) who would have a good
chance at the top prize, but any player good
enough to be considered will surely have
enough class to avoid it, no matter how bad
he has to play. In the final voting the Heis
man Trophy will go to Fred Bartowski, an

tackle
State. Next thing you know he'll want to ap-

unsuspecting 2nd_ string for Idaho
pear on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Fred
always was sort of a loser.

Only one thing could stop Fred from win-
ning the trophy—my betting that he could.

Congratulations go to George Blanda, for
pulling out another game in the clutch, and to
Ron Johnson for holding his arms up in the
air five yards from the end zone. To Blanda
goes a new football, and to Johnson goes a
bun and some mustard.

Go Cocks.

BY DOUG BURTON

Jazz followers unfamiliar with
Charlie Byrd were pleasantly sur-
prised last Friday night when the
Charlie Byrd Quintet displayed the
subtle techniques of Brazilian folk,
light jazz, classical guitar and per-
sonal inyprovization that has carried
the group across five continents.
Among the oferings were personaliz-
ed versions of “Hey Jude,” “Aquari-
us” and a roguish parody of “The
Battle Hymn of the Republic.”

During the intermission some of
the musicians talked informally with
The Ring-tum Phi about the current
of pop rock today.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Charlie Byrd: Jazz In “Progress

Byrd, like jazzmen everywhere,
warms to hear the sound of brass in
contemporary rock groups like Chic-
ago and Blood, Sweat and Tears. “I
like the groups with the horns,” said
the man responsible for introducing
Bosa Nova to the states in 1961.”
Guitar groups tend to get muddy, al-
though the Beatles’ guitars usually
sound pretty good. I like very much
their tunes.”

Billy Reichenbach, Charlie’s_tal-
ented drummer for nine years agreed
but added, “Their (the Beatles) tunes
are very pleasant to hear, but way
down deep | think somebody else
wrote them.”

Hearing this, Byrd said, ‘Well,
they said the same thing about Benny
Goodman.”

Reichenbach went on to say that
modern rock has evolved much as
jazz evolved in the 20's. “What hap-
pened was a bunch of very young
people who didn’t have much musi-
cal intelligence got together and al-
most created a new style of music,
but now rock, like jazz, has gone
into improvisation. Maybe in a gen-
eration you won't be able to tell the
two apart... . A lot of drum sets
and guitars are going up into the
attic because Chicago is playing
stuff the kid on the corner can’t
play. That's why the kid on the
corner didn’t play jazz. —

“We have discovered how primi-
tive Dixie Land jazz was in the
twenties. Well, rock in the sixties 1s
the same go around. Listening to
some of the groups is like hearing a
dog getting beat with a belt... But
I think a lot of today’s music is very
exciting.”

Mario Darpino, the group's flut-
ist, finds hard rock far distant from
the jazz diet he cut his teeth on as a
youngster, playing in bars in Hup-
percup, New York, yet he does not
think of jazz as a fixed musical me-
dium. He said the quintet’s pre-
occupation with jazz was a “progres-
sion” not a “retrogression” to an
earlier period.

All of the musicians expressed
their disappointment at the noise of
the crowd in Doremus, especially
during Byrd’s interlude of classical
guitar. But as Byrd's brother Joe
said, “the group has been together
long enough to know what to expect
from the audience, and when to ex-
pect it.” “At least,” he said, “the
crowd wasn't hostile.”

Recruitment Shapes Up

(Continued from Page 1)

new organization is to see high
school students during Thanksgiving
and Christmas vacations. Steve Rob
inson referred to the direct correla-
tion between personal visits and in-
creased admissions. A large percen-
tage of boys come to W&L after
meeting someone in an interview.
The Student Recruitment Commit-
tee feels that it can help interview
prospective students that the Ad-
mission Office cannot interview due
to its manpower limitations.

When the Admission Office is
shorthanded, the committee helps

show high school men around camp-
us. During the spring months the
committee will try to get accepted
students to come stay at WAL for a
couple of days.

All together committee members
plan to make 100-150 visits for the
purpose of student recruitment. At
their own expense these men hope
to talk personally with over 400
prospective students.

”? LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

(Continued from Page 3)
facility are given with a stipulation
of their usage. Perhaps there are
wealthy alumni more concerned with
the gridiron than with the mind.
Still, they do not demand athletic
scholarships. And the value of he
new gymnasium in comparison to the
needed library, the needed theatre,
the needed fine arts expansion, the
needed publications, loses signific-
ance.

It seems that the writer of a let-
ter-to-the-editor should have a solu-
tion in mind. I don’t. Unless it be
careful consideration of the conflici:
what is being done versus what is
needed.

“Wisdom In Humor”:
Pattables’ Art Is

More Than Voyeurism
(Continued from Page 1)

for “quilting”. The method is relat-
ed indeed to the folk art of quilting
practiced in our Appalachians, with
the exception that this use of trap-
unto results in realistic pictures
rather than the abstract patterns
found in quilts. The way artist Mor-
rison has used the age-old folk art
has an amusing twist in itself. While
the makers of quilts unconsciously
make “modern” abstract designs,
this most modern artist has playfully
reversed this most suitable of meth-
ods for abstract patterns by using
it to picture the most ancient and
most traditional of subjects in art—
the human figure. As if to com-
pound the amusing irony of revers-
ing the abstract-realistic roles, the
work is mounted in window frames
and door frames instead of in pic-
ture frames. Picture frames remove
the work of art from its immediate
surroundings, giving it a world of its
own, but the door and window
frames insist on relating the work to
this world. By observing these nudes
through a door or window the ob-
server becomes a voyeur rather than
a gallery visitor.

All of a sudden this house of fun
compels us to our first serious
thought—is the traditional show of
academic nudes nothing more than
sophisticated voyeurism? From this,
more serious questions about art
come tumbling into our mind. There
is more wisdom in humor than can
be found in much of our serious
statements.

a Flubarty pass and returned it to
the 24 of the Generals. On the very
next play an off-tackle slant went
for the score. The conversion was
good and the score stood 17-7, the
Generals still behind.

Near the end of the game a fresh-
man split end, Rick Romanelli, was
substituted for Mahaffey. With a
few receptions, Romanelli helped
carry the team to the Washington
18 with only 3:30 left in the game.
The next play was the score, an aer-
ial to Romanelli in the end zone. The
conversion attempt failed though
and moments later the season ended
with a 17-13 loss.

Outstanding performances in this
game, and over the season, are num-
erous. It would be unfair to cite
just a few. The failure of the offense
to t'ossom until late in the season
accounts for the Generals’ slow
start, and a few ill-timed mistakes
have hurt a team, that, statistically
appears potent. The potential is
there, and as Howard Cosell would
say, maybe next year.

PinPoint: On IFC

Carlton did not disclose his source,
one must assume that his estimates
are merely personal conjectures.
Whatever the case, the quality of a
fraternity system is not necessarily
affected by percentage and numbers.

Finally, Mr. Carlton’s harangue
lacked a positive approach to the
problem. He never suggested a con-
structive alternative to the extended
rush system; he chose merely to
criticize it. Admittedly, this year's
rush plan had defects, but the plan
was never considered to be ideal.
After all, no new system is com-
pletely bug-free. At least the IFC is
trying to solve the problems.
