Yearbooks Have Arrived

With the appearance this week of
the 1971 “Calyx” its editor, John
McCardell, announced that the year-
book has been dedicated jointly to
Professor Charles P. Light, former
dean of the School of Law; Dr.
Henry S. Roberts, head of the de-
partment of biology; and William
McC, Schildt, associate dean of stu-
dents and freshman coordinator.

The 1971 “Calyx” is now being
distributed in the Calyx office up-
stairs in the Student Center. Students
may receive their copies from 10:30
am. until 4:30 p.m. on Thursday
or Friday.

The three gentlemen to whom the
book is dedicated represent each of
the three major divisions of the uni-

versity Dean Light, the Law

in which he teaches business law in
addition to his administrative tasks.

With “change” as the theme of
this year’s annual, all three faculty
members, according to McCardell,
represent “the spirit of a changing
university within a heritage of mean-
ingful tradition.”

Among innovations inchided in
this year’s volume were an interview
format to present those to whom the
book is dedicated as well as a merg-
ing of the senior section and the
faculty section, grouped by depart-
mental majors. McCardell stated so
far student reaction to the book has
been mixed, “But over all it seems
to be quite favorable..”

The “Calyx” describes Dean Light
as “a patient and understanding
counselor, a beloved and respected
teacher, a gentleman and a friend.”
After retiring as dean in 1967—after
more than forty year’s previous
service on the W&L faculty—he re-
turned as dean for a year when his
successor, Robert E. R. Huntley, was
elected president of the university
Dean Light continues to teach full-
time courses in constitutional law,
torts, and federal law.

Dr. Roberts, former chairman of
the conmemittee which oversaw the
most comprehensive updating in the
university's curriculum in decades, is
praised for having been “instru
mental in the changes,” a man “who
worked tirelessly to revise and mod
ernize the course of study and who
successfully championed so progres

 

Warm spring weather and a lack of parking places have encouraged many

sive a measure to make Washington
and Lee an even better school.”

Dr. Roberts came to W&L in
1964 from Duke University, where
he had a member of the graduate
faculty in zoology.

Dean Schildt, a summa cum laude
law graduate of the university, is
characterized as “a dynamic indi-
vidual (who) impresses everyone he
meets with his sincerity and con-
viction, He possesses all the quali-
ties that an uncertain future de-
mands,” continues the dedication
text, “the qualities of a Washington
and Lee man, not unmindful of the
future.”

McCardell expressed special
thanks to Assistant Editor Don
Marshall, photographers Pat Hinely
and Walt Bransford, and University-
Classes editor Joe Blake, “who were
always here and always willing to
accept any responsibilities and
tasks.”

“This is their book, as much as
it is mine,” McCardell said. Several
weeks ago the Publication Board
designated Marshall to be the editor
of the 1972 “Calyx.”

codification is possible. Clearly how-
ever, trust entails the absence of
suspicion, threat, and fear. It as-
sumes respect for persons and it
acknowledges honesty and trust-
worthiness as the prerequisites of
respect.

“It is our conviction that com-
munity of trust provides the environ-

lectual growth can ‘best occur. But
we recognize that such a community
rarely if ever comes into being with-
out conscious effort on the part of

Students Must
Register Cars

The Office of the Dean of Students
has announced that, beginning with
the next academic year, all student
cars must be registered with the
university. It was emphasized, how-
ever, that only those students who
wish access to W&L parking facili-
ties will be required to pay the
$15.00 parking fee.

Also the stipulation in this year’s
regulations prohibiting campus park-
ing for students living within a half-
mile radius of Washington Hall will
be eliminated. Since the administra-
tion anticipates increased parking
areas near the new Doremus Gym-
nasium and elsewhere, university
parking will be available to any stu-
dent, without regard to his resi-
dential proximity to campus.

“We are sorry that any restrictions
at all are necessary,” said Lewis G.
John, Dean of Students. “We recog-
nize the inconvenience caused to
students by the regulations, and we
hope we can add parking spaces and
areas to alleviate this problem.”

Four stickers will be distributed
for registration, each to identify
automobiles in the following cate-
gories: (1) those owned by faculty,
staff, and dormitory counselors, who
may park in special areas behind
the campus—no fee, (2) those owned
by upperclassmen, who will use stu-
dent-designated parking areas—$15
fee, (3) those owned by freshmen,
who must use the Liberty Hall park-
ing facilities only—$15 fee, and (4)
those owned by students who do not
wish to use university parking—no
fee.

Registration, as usual, will take
place in the matriculation line in
September. The administration hopes
that parking areas may be added
next year below the Doremus Gym-
nasium addition and also expects
that the lot in front of the gym will
be more fully used.

“The parking problem this year
has worked out better than we had
anticipated,” John continued. “There
was a rash of violations at the very
beginning of the spring term, but
overall we have found the students
to be very cooperative.”

Most of the violations tallied by
the university Proctor this year have
concerned students parking in the
faculty and staff areas behind the
campus. Dean John explained that
the purpose for having all student
cars under university registration was
to help identify violators and to aid
university officials in their statistical
analyses and vehicle studies.

 

those who build it. The successful
building of a trusting community
requires initially that every member
devote himself unswervingly and
totally to being always and in every-
thing worthy of being trusted.
Simultaneously it requires that he
accept others as people he can and
will trust.

 

The President of the Student
Body and the President-elect have
told me of the statement which
the two Executive Committees
have made about the honor sys-
tem. The subject has received
their most careful and deliberate
thought. From my own personal
experience and observation over
a time which spans two and a
half decades at Washington and
Lee, I know without doubt that
the single most valuable experi-
ence which a student here may
have is the experience of living
in a community characterized by
mutual trust. It may be that such
an atmosphere of trust and honor
is rarer in the world today than
ever before; if so, it is even more
to be cherished and coveted
among us here.

The joint Executive Commit-
tees have succinctly expressed the
basic premise on which our honor
system rests. I share and endorse
their commitment to that premise.

R. E. R. Huntley

 

 

 

“In full confidence that Honor,
conceived as mutual trust, will bear
the closest scrutiny and demand the
fullest measure of devotion we
commend this way of life once more
to the entire University community
for re-examination and recommit-
ment.”

Each EC passed this proposal
unanimously with little discussion.

This year’s EC officially recogniz-
ed the Student Association for Black
Unity. This means that the group
can use the facilities of the Univer-
sity Center.

A report was presented by Mark

McMinn, chairman of the Film
Committee. McMinn summarized
the activities of his committee

throughout the year. He said about
$200 was left over from their alloted
funds. He encouraged that these
surplus funds be spent in acquiring
a new projector. Currently, the
group utilizes a projector owned by
the Art Department. The EC approv-
ed this allocation.

Joe Tompkins said the Student
Financial Relations Committee an-
ticipated about a $500 surplus this
year after the fines are collected.
He moved that chairman Henry
Harkey and next year’s chairman
Chuck Lee be allowed to donate
about $200 to some worthwhile com-
munity project. This motion passed
unanimously.

Once the 1970-71 EC adjourned
the 1971-72 EC held a brief session.
The Honor System proposal was
passed as the first order of business.

National Humanities Gift
Sponsors Library Course

“A more complete understanding
of the library and how to use it is
essential,” according to W&L’s head
librarian, Maurice D. Leach. And
with this purpose in mind Mr,
Leach will direct a program next
year designed to increase faculty and
student familiarity with the scope of
resources in the university's under-
graduate library system. The five-
year project will be funded through
a $50,000 grant made jointly by the
National Endowment for the Hu-
manities and the Council on Library
Resources.

President Huntley announced last
week that the program, expected to
begin July 1, will aim to include
faculty and students in the total
project, to help make the university
community more knowledgeable as
to the varied uses of the main Me-
Cormick Library as well as the
separate collections in six under-
graduate departments.

Dr. Linton L, Barrett, professor
of Romance languages, has been
named reference coordinator of the
program. He plans to devote half
of his professional time to the de-
velopment and execution of the plan
over the next five years,

The program will emphasize the

library system's reference services,

the relative strengths and flaws with
in the departmental collections, and
also the methods by which students
may make the most effective use of
both on-campus resources and those

students and faculty members to ride bicycles and motocycles to school.

of the inter-library loan service.

During the first stages of the
program, only selected academic
departments in the undergraduate
College will be involved. Each
participating department will select
a liason professor who will teach
an intensive bibliographical course
dealing specifically with library re-
sources available in the department's
field.

During the second year, that of
academic year 1972-1973, two stu-
dents will be incorporated into the
project. By 1976 there will be eight
additional student participants.

Mr. Leach pointed out that with
an increasing importance being plac-
ed on independent study, particularly
during the spring term, the library
program could be especially valu-
able. Evenwally, it is hoped, the
program may become a permanent
system designed to familiarize every
student with the latent resources of
the library facilities,

The new program accompanies a
recently increasing emphasis on the
imporiance of the WAL library to
the university. Since 1965 the pro-
portion of library expenditures per
student has increased nearly 400
percent, and since 1967 the library
budget has almost tripled. Present
holdings include more than 300,000
publications and the adminisiration
is preparing plans for the construc-
tion of a new library plant in future
years

 
 

 

 

 

2 THE RING-TUM PHI

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

 

May 206, 1971

Exams start Monday. And not long after their completion
come “the great equalizers.” That is to say grades. The grad-
ing system seems as firmly entrenched at W&L as white
columns and red brick, The only major modification of that
code in recent years was the introduction of the Pass-Fail
option.

Under this system a student receives no letter grade at
all. Instead the individual fulfills the necessary work for the
course and passes or, on the other hand, fails.

This innovation has been well received by students. Cur-
rently any student with sophomore standing can enroll in
one Pass-Fail course each term. In the academic year of
1967-1968, when the new plan was initially offered, a total
of 147 courses was taken on this basis. A year later the
total climbed to 244, Last year 343 courses were taken on a
Pass-Fail basis. This year 436 men utilized this opportunity.
According to Registrar Harold Head, next year’s student
body plans to enroll in even more courses Pass-Fail. The trend
seems evident: W&L students are taking more and more
Pass-Fail courses. The purpose of mentioning these facts is
two-fold, First, we believe that Washington and Lee benefitted
from this modification in the grading format. Second, we
contend that further study of alterations could result in
greater benefits to W&L.

Grades do serve a purpose. Graduate schools need a scale
to evaluate undergraduates. Grades are that scale. Also,
Washington and Lee uses grades to study the kind of teach-
ing job it is doing compared with other institutions or possibly
compared with previous students at W&L. Many employers
look at grades before they hire employees in order to guage
work accomplishment for the future.

Keeping these scaling purposes in mind, is it possible that
our university might establish another scale? Such an alternate
system might incorporate Graduate Record Examinations,
Achievement Tests or Aptitude Tests. Such an approach would
still provide the quantitative data required for evaluation and
comparison.

Hollins College requires its students to take the GRE’s
The W&L Politics Department tried a similar approach this
spring. The department paid for the tests and all graduating
majors were requested to take the test. Hopes are high that
the results will give the faculty some idea of the quality of
education a W&L man is receiving in political science.

A system of universal testing would have some inherent
draw-backs. Some students do not test well, they get too
nervous and tense for these kinds of evaluations. The tests do
not give a fair indication of the ability of those individuals.
Such a program of mass attendance at GRE’s would mean
more time and cost for the school. This alternative to grades
has some obvious flaws as we have shown.

Perhaps grades could be simply de-emphasized. The idea
of avoiding a particular course because of a record of cor-
responding poor grades is saddening in our academic com-
munity. Even more discouraging is the exodus of students to
courses with reputations for easy grades, The emphasis seems
to be on grades not the teaching and learning process.

But what can be done to improve the grading system at

W&L?

One preliminary solution might be eliminating the grade
F in the undergraduate courses. This doctrine may seem like
a pleasant dream to many undergraduates. Yet, a faculty
member, Dr. E, L. Pinney, has proposed discussion of this
plan before the University Council. The idea is to be dis-
cussed in the council's next session.

According to Dr, Pinney, Randolph-Macon Woman's Col-
lege has accomplished such a goal. They use a 3.0 scale under
which a student is not penalized for a failure, Dr. Pinney
explained that the grade F accomplishes two goals—it evalu-
ates a student's work and it penalizes him, Pinney disagreed
with the penalty that an undergraduate receives for failing
a course,

Still another solution would be widely expanding the Pass-
Fail option. Under existing academic requirements no required
courses can be taken in major fields Pass-Fail. Also cognates
and distribution courses are not accepted unless they are
taken for a grade. Some of these restrictions might be removed.

In closing it should be explained why change is needed in
reference to grades, Grades are often unfair, Grades vary from
department to department and from professor to professor.
In defense of the administration a guideline has been estab-
lished for grades. “A” work is termed exceptional, “B" work
is good and so on, However, this guideline is interpreted
differently by different teachers and the results are great
inequities,

We do not endorse a percentage plan for grades. The flunk
out quotas imposed at some overcrowded state schools need
not be applied to our university, Our school is unique in its
ability to freely evolve solutions to new problems, This prob-
lem of grades is over-shadowing the genuine academic interests
of W&L, No clear solution is evident. Yet, now is the time
to re-evaluate the importance and effects of grades at W&l

Short Spring Term Evaluated

By HAGOOD ELLISON

With less than one week left in
the school year, faculty members
and students are looking back on the
newly-innovated Spring term with
surprising optimism.

The change from the old two-
semester system to a more flexible
12-12-6 has been a smooth one.
Dean of Students Lewis John called
the overall transition a “good one,”
with “more \positive than negative
results in the first year.” John sees
the change as ‘being beneficial, not
only for the students but the whole
University as well.

The key and impetus for the
Spring term was, and still is, indi-
vidual directed study. This point was
borne out by Student Body Presi-
dent Steve Robinson, who saw the
mini-semester as a chance for stu-
dents to get into a subject with
greater depth. If anything, it has
opened the doors of hard-line re-
strictions and has granted students
a better opportunity for self-discip-
line in fields of individual study.

Roger Munsick, Ohairman of the
Student Curriculum Committee, felt
that this term has given each person
a chance for individuality by com-
mitment to what one is interested
in. Especially Munsick noted the
Total Theatre and French Emersion
courses which required “total de-
votion by the individual.” The term
has also given many students the
chance for work away from the Uni-
versity during the regular school
year. Foreign Language students are
now in France, Germany, and Spain,
while Biology, Journalism, and
Politics students have been able to
study away from campus too.

The “Short term” as it has been
called, has not ‘been without its
faults. Dr. John Devogt, newly elect-
ed Chairman of the Faculty Cur-
riculum Committee, felt that some
students had viewed the term from
the beginning as a vacation, and
that because of a poor job of “sell-
ing it” to the students, the full ad-
vantages were not utilized, Devogt
went on to add that the adaptation
of regular one-semester courses to
a summer-school framework has not
been entirely satisfactory.

Like others, he anticipates a re-
vamping of courses crammed into
six-weeks, with more seminars and
individual study.

 

By MONTY COTTIER

“Winter in the Shenandoah Val-
ley,” begins an essay much admired
by yours truly, “is a cold, wet, and
dreary proposition.” Much in the
same vein is the perennial observa-
tion that “I don’t know whether
spring in Lexington is really nice,
or if it just seems that way because
the winters are so horrible.” Every-
one usually looks at the author of
this observation, and there is gen-
eral, although exceedingly moderate,
laughter.

Well, that time of year has rolled
around and, in order to bring this
whole thing to a conclusion once
and for all, we here at “The Phi (as
we call it; we understand that many
of our classmates have other names
for it)’ have decided to give the
thing a cursory (no, that doesn’t
mean what you think it does, and,
anyway. stop asking questions)
examination.

Our basic premise (and what's
ours is yours, . . . you know that)
is that the months of April, May,
and whatever of June must be en-
dured before we escape are, in and
of themselves, enjoyable, without
the added comparison with the pre-
ceeding Decenvber, January and
February (you may note that we have
left out March, This is intentional,
as We are not at all sure that there
is supposed to be a March, and any-
way its usually too wet to do any
thing with)

“Why.” we are often asked, “do
people seem {0 enjoy spring so
much?” Now, these questions always
confuse us just a bit, since this is
actually supposed to be the billing
office for Virginia Power & Electric
Co., but we try to do our best, any-
way

To begin, then, spring in this gen
eral neighborhood has numerous ad-
vantages to recommend il, some of
which will have to come to mind
if this thing is ever going to get
written. Oh, yeah

What is in the future for the
Spring term? The calendar for 1971-
72 is set, so it will be with us at
least one more year, The Faculty
Curriculum Committee will prob-
ably begin evaluation of it next fall
in time for the ’73 calendar, Students

can feel safe that we will not return
to the previous two-semster system.
The long stretch from January to
April still seems to be filled with
the mid-winter apathy, and certainly
the Faculty will take a long look at
putting the short term there.

Regardless of some problems, the
Spring Term has ‘been a fresh break
from the past, has opened the fields
of individual research and study
for nearly all students, and may pave
the way toward a fuller, more ex-
panded curriculum,

SABU Intent

To the Editor:

Here are the purposes and goals
of the Student Association for Black
Unity.

We, the Black students of Wash-
ington and Lee University, believe
that the time is ripe for us to come
together as an organization for the
purposes of benefitting the School,
the white as well as the Black stu-
dents. We do not advocate a
separate but equal student body.
Our sole purpose is to become an
interwoven part of the student body.
We feel that we can benefit both
ourselves and the “white” student
body if we come together as a group
with one major purpose and goal
which encompasses all minor pur-
poses and goals.

We feel that our feelings cannot
be felt nor can our needs ‘be known
if the identity and social customs
which we possess cannot conform
and assimilate with that of the white
students, We support this fact by
showing that the administration of
this school is blind and ignorant
of the needs of the blacks who are
presently enrolled. It cannot be said
that the administration is totally to
blame. This is a new and unique
experience for this school.

We believe that if black students
are to be incorporated into this
school, then they should not be so
diffused and absorbed that they do
not offer anything of value to the
school nor to the Black community
in years to come. To prevent this,
we feel that this organization will be
of rewarding value.

Another primary goal is to see
that the future blacks will be accli-
mated here at Washington and Lee.
We believe that the administration
as well as the blacks can benefit if
the administration is informed about
“Blackness” from our point of view.

Moreover, it is our intention to
make this white student body aware
of the fact that we do have some-
thing that is important and of great
value to this University. We are of
the opinion that a Black Culwre
Program is much needed on this
campus. There is a need to make
these students realize the great con-
tribution that Blacks have made to
this great country. We intend to
sponsor other programs along these
same lines throughout the year.
These programs will help to curtail
the wide gap in the lack of under-
standing between the black and
white sudents. The promulgation of
our ‘beliefs, ideas and customs will
be very educational to the entire
school.

Our goal is to let it be known,
as much as possible, that this Uni-
versity must be committed to what
“ought to be” in this society as well
as what “is.” It must not be con-
cerned with the giving of knowledge
itself ‘but also with the utility of
knowledge. This is why the Uni-
versity and the blacks should con-
ceive of themselves as servants of
each other.

Dear Sir:

Concerning the “Word of Thanks

believe you have omitted two people
who should also have been men-
tioned in connection with that “un-
usual advertisement.” Two WLUR
staff members, Mr. Lou Rieder and
Mr. Kirkpatrick, put a large effort
into the production of those an-
nouncements. Two announcements
were produced, to be aired on two
different days. The spots were indeed
professionally done, and reflect the

LaRue’s Press Box

Lacrosse, Belmont and Indy

Washington and Lee’s lacrosse
image was certainly not harmed by
the events of the past weekend in
the national playoffs. Saturday, Navy
which edged the Generals 10-8,
knocked off top-ranked Virginia.
In other action Maryland slaughter-
ed Air Force, Army crushed Hofstra,
and Cornell nipped Brown in an
all-Ivy battle.

In the semi-finals, Navy meets
Maryland in a ‘battle of state powers,
while Army takes on Cornell. From
here, it looks like Navy will knock
off Maryland and that Army will
best Cornell. Finally, an Army-Navy
match of championship calibre.

Will Canonero Il become the first
horse since Citation to win the
rriple Crown? Tune in June 5 for
the Belmont Stakes. The odds are
against the Latin American entry
which has already claimed the Ken-
tucky Derby and the Preakness, as
only two favorites have successfully
finished as predicted on this mile and
a half track.

And in another great race, the
Indy 500, which takes place May 29
the records are falling like flies,

 

which is not really new. Sunday was
the last chance to bump someone
out of the thirty-three car starting
line, but few of the entries listed
Saturday had anything to fear.

This year, the record run over the
two and a half mile course was
Peter Revson’s 178.7 mph _ pace
which averaged 171.25 over ten
miles. That's up from last year’s
166.8 for those of you who eat
statistics,

Races seem to be the priority
this week. It was interesting to note
that Marty Liquori, perhaps with-
out the pressure of Jim Ryun to
stimulate him, turned in an atrocious
4:10.9 for the mile run at the El
Paso Invitational. A week earlier in
Philadelphia Liqouri beat Ryun with
a swift 3:54.6. In all fairness it
should be noted, however, that the
Texas winds rose to 45 mph last
weekend,

As a sidenote, a familiar name
won the shot put event at 66’ 5°—
Randy Matson.

And finally, a big thank you goes
out to all those who helped stage
yesterday's All-Sports Banquet,
which was a very good show.

Small Opposition

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

In a recent article in The Ring-
tum Phi, we were all subjected to
a lesson in Political Science by that
old master, Marc Small. Mr. Small
gave us a lecture in how to be biased
individuals while trying not to ap-
pear so. This is in conjunction with
a course that he is trying to insti-
tute: Political One-sidedness 101, In
his last lecture, Mr. Small used the
concepts of political persecution, in-
justices, appeals to sectionalism, and
a blatant distortion of point of view
in regards to an issue. He did so
in order to establish and set up a
particularly biased commentary on
the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

To deny the fundamental right
of voting to anyone is a terrible in-
justice, and serious threat to the well
being of this nation. Mr. Small
makes an even greater threat to the
well ‘being ‘by helping to retard
change. He does so by “knit-pick-
ing” about who is at fault, and
where the blame should be placed.
By doing so Mr. Small helps only
to perpetuate a system that has
denied the full attainment of politi-
cal rights, thereby prolonging in-
justice and increasing hostilities.

0 THe

 

and
them much worth at that. Is not this
country based on the premise that
everyone iis entitled to the vote, and
that if any particular individual who

value judgement, not giving

is justified to vote is denied that
right, then the system should be
amended?

Mr. Small, likes to complain about
the system, and complain about
changes to it that don’t conform to
his standards. He does so openly,
which is his right, but 1 wonder why
in his role as commentator he does
not suggest constructive alternatives?
I would much rather see him do this
as Opposed to asserting: “There are
many things the Federal Govern-
ment can do to increase Civil
Rights, ...” and theh not listing any-
thing!

The final thing that struck me as
strange about Mr. Small’s com-
mentary is his claim that the South
is being punished for it’s honesty. On
the contrary “professor” Small, if
the South is being punished at all,
it is for the “injustice,” that you
have admitted has existed in the
South. Also since | am a Black
man from the “South” I can attest
to the fact that it still does exist.

If this is the type of thinking that
is allowed to run rampant through
the pages of this paper, then I am
quite distressed at the prospects of
reading future issues of The Ring-
tum Phi.

Johnny L. White, ‘74

 

   
 

A responsible American sees be-
yond his own nose; it hurts me to
say that Mr. Small has not done
so in this instance. He also let the
readers of the Phi down by collaps-
ing into yellow journalism; with pas-
sages like “While it might cause
a quite minor increase in voting
rights among those eleven states, .. .”
