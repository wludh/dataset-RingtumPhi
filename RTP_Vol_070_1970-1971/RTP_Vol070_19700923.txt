Executive Committee Establishes
Study of Budget and Constitution

Several new committees were es-
tablished by the Executive Commit-
tee in its first meeting last Monday
evening. While in session the EC
also set a slate for an Open Forum
of student complaints and sugges-
tions.

Initially, the University Standing
Committees made informal reports
concerning their projected needs
for this year. The University Center
Committee failed to make any such
report,

Student Body President, Fran
Lawrence, established a new com-
mittee to study the budgeting of the
funds allotted to the EC. Both Joe
Tompkins and Phil Thompson will
serve on this group.

After brief discussion between
President Lawrence and junior Glenn
Azuma, a Community Relations
Committee was founded, Further
discussion and selection for this
committee were postponed until
September 28.

Senior Staman Ogilvie and junior
Glenn Azuma will head the com-
mittee approved in Monday’s meet-
ing. They will examine the need and
feasibility of a constitutional revi-
sion. ZF

It was announced by the EC that
an “Open Forum” will be held on
the afternoon of September 30. Fran
Lawrence stated that this forum was
designed so that “anyone can bring
anything up for discussion.” This
kind of approach will be an attempt
to duplicate the Bitch-ins of former
Student Body President Jay Passa-
vant.

The Passavant “Bitch-In” was con-
ducted in duPont Auditorium in No-

vember of 1968. A group of about
50 students gathered to air com-
plaints at the EC sponsored func-
tion. Several student body officers,
including current EC members Sta-
man Ogilvie and Joe Tompkins, took
part in the discussion.

Finally, it was disclosed that two
“workshops” will be held by the EC
after its meeting September 28. One
“workshop” will deal with the prob-
lem of a constitutional revision. The
second workshop concerns the gen-
eral allocation of the EC’s funds and
more specifically the establishment
of a budget.

Harland Foundation Endows Contact

Matt Cole, Chairman of Contact,
announced Tuesday the gift of $1000
to the Contact committee by the
John H. Harland Foundation.

Contact is the week-long sympos-
ium designed to discuss key issues
of the day. The organization annu-
ally brings vital speakers to the
Lexington campus. This year the
program will explore “The Expand-
ing and Changing Role of Higher
Education.”

Cole explained that since speakers
this year are generally charging fees
on the average $250 higher than
last year, the gift will be used to sup-
plement student funds to maintain
the high quality of speaketrs in the
past. In addition, Cole expressed the
hope that the Contact committee

will be able to present more speakers

President Robert E. R. Huntley
issued a statement expressing his
pleasure with the announcement:
“This generous gift from the John
H. Harland Foundation is a source
of great encouragement to all of us
at Washington and Lee. It comes, at
once, as a recognition of the high
quality of commentary and partici-
pation that past Contact programs
have provided, and as an inspiration
for our students to continue to us
this kind of forum for the useful ex-
ploration of important, timely ideas.
I know all of us are grateful for this
vote of confidence in the potential
of Contact and its student leader-
ship.”

Cole, upon receiving the gift, re-
marked, “The committee deeply ap-
preciates the interest that the John
H .Harland Foundation has shown
in the university and in Contact. An
unrestricted grant of this size helps

 

to re-inforce the idea that students
and adults have a common goal in
education. And though the gift com-
prises only about one-eighth of the
total Contact budget, it certainly
goes a long way in insuring the suc-
cess of this year’s program.” Cole
further stated that the Committee is
continuing to raise the balance of
the $8500 budget from students, par-
ents, and the IFC.

Two Teachers Cited

Dr. James Graham Leyburn and
Prof. O. W. Riegel of Washington
and Lee University have been select-
ed to appear in the 1970 edition of
“Outstanding Educators in Ameri-
ca,” an annual volume honoring
teachers of exceptional achievement,
dedication and service throughout
the nation.

Both Dr. Leyburn, professor of
sociology and anthropology, and
Mr. Riegel, professor of journalism
and communications, were heads of
their academic departments until re-
tirement from administrative duties
in recent years. Both continue to
teach full time.

Dr. Leyburn came to Washington
and Lee in 1947 as dean of the uni-
versity, a post he held until 1955.
Before coming to Washington and
Lee he had been professor of socio-
logy at Yale University.

He earned his bachelor of arts de-
gree in 1920 from Trinity College
(now Duke University), a master’s
degree in economics from Trinity in
1921, a second master’s degree in
economics from Princeton Univer-
sity in 1922, and his Ph.D. in socio-
logy from Yale in 1927.

He has taught at Hollins College
and Princeton as well as at Yale
prior to joining the faculty at Wash-
ington and Lee.

‘aa Visa Free University Will |
Be Offering Courses This Year |

A poetry reading by Professor Dabney Stuart next week-
end will begin the fall Free University activities here.

Last spring, in conjunction with
other student activity, a “Free Uni-
versity” program was established.

IFC Studies Food Buying

Tuesday night's Interfraternity
Council saw the beginning of discus-
sion On a cooperative food-buying
plan, which is designed to save the
fraternities money. Mr. Jerry Dar-
rell of Evans Dining Hall introduced
the plan last week, but did not pre-
sent full information at that time.

Mr. Darrell’s plan, which he said
was one of personal interest to him,
provides for twice-weekly orders
and deliveries. Although he expects
to be able to provide most foods
eventually, he explained that only
meats, frozen vegetables, and gro-
ceries would be available at the be-
ginning. The plans calls for having
bills paid and orders placed on time,
both of which serve as a built-in
safety device so that fraternities will
not be faced with large outstanding
bills, as many were at the end of last
year.

In other business, the IFC passed
for the second week in a row a con-
stitutional amendment which calls
for the presence of both the presi-

City Tags Now Required

BY SKIP PAUKERT

Washington and Lee students will be at-
taching Lexington city tags to their automo-
biles for the first time this year. The Lexing
ton City Council has enacted the much dis-
cussed student licensing proposal, requiring
all students possessing cars here to purchase
an initial tag for five dollars and then another
ten dollar tag next spring.

The five dollar tags will be available at
the City Treasurer's Office at the Lexington
City Hall after October 1, 1970, and will be
ood for a six month period, Then the ten
dollar tags, effective for a twelve month per
iod, must be purchased after March 15, 1971,
and no later than April 15, 1971, City officials
intend to enforce the measure with the pen
alty of a considerable fine,

“The purpose of the student tags ts purely
financial,” insisted the Mayor of Lexington,
Douglas E. Brady, “We feel the tax ts justi
fied, since students use the streets just as
much as the city residents do.”

Lexington’s Commissioner of Revenue,
Mr. 1. C. Baker, estimated that the student li
censing world yield the city six thousand dol
lars during the coming budgetary year, Th

money from the student tags, just as tha
from the local residents’ tags, will be deposit
ed in the Lexington general fund, to be ear
marked for no particular expenditure

The only students exempted from buying
the city license are those whose cars bear tage
from Virginia municipality. The City Council
has not yet resolved, however, what provision

and VMI,

who otherwise would be compelled to pay ten

should be made for seniors at W&1
dollars for the twelve month tag with less
than two months left before their wraduation

The idea of student auto licensing origi
last May,

tudent repre

nated in a City Council meeting

which was attended by two
sentatives, I, C, members Staman Ogilvie
and Phil Thompson The Commissioner o
Revenue, Mr. Baker, had then pointed out that
the city of Charlottesville had

both auto licensing and assessment of per

undertaken

sonel properties to apply to University of

Virginia students
\t that time Ogilvie and Thompson ceded
the justification for the licensing of vehick

but requested the proeprty tax be waived for

students

Their contention was that a distinetio

must be made between resident who are

dent of each fraternity and the IFC
representative of each fraternity.
Both would be allowed a vote; fines
would be levied for those not in at-
tendance.

President Doug Gossman called
for a meeting of the presidents and
treasurers of each fraternity Thurs-
day at 7 p.m. to discuss financial
matters of the IFC.

Notice

A meeting for the Student Recruit-
ing Committee will be held Tuesday,
September 29 at 7:00 p.m. in the
Executive Committee Room of the
Student Center, Former members as
well as interested students are in-
vited to attend according to com-
mittee chairman, Steve Robinson.

This committee was established
last year for a dual purpose. First,
WAL siudenis could interest high
school students in the university.
Second, these same students could

The Free University’s main focus at
that time was on the Vietnam War;
seminars and discussions centered on
foreign policy, Southeast Asia, and
the military.

Since May, several people have
been working to establish Free Uni-
versity again this year. Senior Steve
Haughney and Dr. Thomas Imeson,
Assistant Professor of Biology, have
been particularly active in this effort.
Working in co-operation with the
Bakery Free Library, Haughney and
Imeson have been collecting basic
ideas for the program's operation.

This year’s Free University plans
are to expand from political topics
to a wide range of interest areas.
The reason for this emphasis shift
is to give students (and any other
interested persons) an opportunity to
study or experience fields outside of
the academic realm.

The programs will be open in at-
tendance and direction to those both
inside and outside the University.

Other than the Stuart poetry read-

ranged programs thus far. By next

Rockbridge County
Now Levies Taxes
On W@L Students

BY NED MOORE

Rockbridge County officials today
made notice to all out-of-state Wash-
ington and Lee students who own or
operate a motor vehicle within Rock-
bridge County to purchase a 1970
County license decal on or before
October 1, 1970, or face county pro-
secution.,

Under a recent ruling by the At-
torney-General of the state of Vir-
ginia, anyone, including college stu-
dents, living in a Virginia county
for more than six months out of a
year is considered a resident for tax-
ing purposes. All residents of Vir-
ginia display their county decal
along with their state inspection
sticker on the windshield of their
car. Failure by a resident to own or
display a Virginia county decal
sticker is subject to fines of not more
than $100 and not more than 30
days in jail.

This law, the Motor Vehicle Li-
cense Tax Ordinance of Rockbridge
County, is not new. Until the resi-
dency requirement of six months was
established by the state's Attorney-
General, students had been exempt-
ed from all residency expenses.
Starting in 1971 the Rockbridge
County decal will have to be pur-
chased annually at a cost of $10 by
April 15 of each year.

The 1970 decal has been pro-
rated for the next six months at a
cost of $5. Decals may be purchased
by WAL students at the County Of-
fice Building on Main Street.

REVIEW and OutLooK Reflections Upon Entering W&L

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Some Books Are Missing...

McCormick Library is not often thought of as a center of
student activity. There are no cigarette machines or juke boxes.
Food and drink are not allowed inside the building. Yet stu-
dents do congregate in the library because there are books—-
about 217,000 of them. Or rather, 216,992.

This past May, several students and librarians discovered
eight reference volumes missing from the library, ones which
may not be taken out of the building under any circumstances.
According to University Librarian Maurice D. Leach, the
books in question are from sets of reference volumes which are
sold by distributors as a whole, not separately. Below is a list
of the missing volumes and the estimated cost of replacing
each set in order to recover the missing volumes.

PEDIA $ 550.00

The possible monetary depletion from the library's book
purchasing budget does not concern us as much as the disturb-
ing fact that these books were taken from the library without
any authorization and have not been returned as yet. That this
may be an honor violation is only a conjecture, for the details
of the removal of these volumes is not known, The constitution
of the student body authorizes the Student Library Committee
to investigate such matters; and they are at present attempt-
ing to ascertain who may have taken the books.

Our primary concern is not a black-on-white indictment of
a handful of unknown figures who for, all we know, may have
mistakenly walked off with these volumes. What we are much
more concerned about is the future of the honor system, one
which depends upon the integrity and character of the student
body to uphold it.

What sort of honor system would the Washington and Lee
student body have if there had to be a monitor at the door to a
reference room to insure the safety of valuable books? Mr.
Leach has indicated that the library cannot afford many more
losses such as the one described above, and that a checker at
the door may be necessary in the future. What sort of honor
system would the student body have if the rear door to the li-
brary had to be locked to remind students, to have their books
checked out?

The honor system is not a paper document. It is an attitude.
We trust that this attitude has not changed and we hope that,
in the case of the library, it will not become a phantasmagoric
absurdity.

On Logic and The City of Lexington

Washington and Lee and VMI students who own automo-
biles now can not only rejoice in the exhilarating spirit of com-
petition (i.e, by attempting to find a parking place in town),
but they can also count themselves as members of an elite
mobile landed gentry (i.e., by having to pay a property tax on
their cars).

The Lexington City Council has passed a motion which re-
quires that all students purchase a $5 city tag for their cars this
October and a $10 tag in March, Last May, the City Council at-
tempted to pass a property tax on students as well, but
Messrs. Staman Ogilvie and Phil Thompson put forth the ar-
gument that college students receive little benefit from the
community while they help to sustain the city’s economy. The
Council rejected the personal property assessment; instead,
another property tax, a tax on students’ cars, was instituted.

We find the reasoning behind the institution of this pro-
posal extremely faulty. If the Council sees fit to tax students
who have cars because they share the streets with local resi-
dents, we have no objection, Yet we do object strongly to
where the money is going. Logically, if the students from
W&L and VMI pay the city’s tax on their cars they should ex-
pect that the money obtained from the taxation should go di-
rectly into the city’s road maintenance budget.

Ilogically, the money is placed into the Lexington general
fund. Therefore the reasoning behind the tax is more of an
excuse than a justification, We ask the Lexington City Council
to set aside the estimated $6,000 revenue that will be accrued
from the tax for use in the maintenance and construction of the
city’s roads,

If the tax on students’ cars is to have a logical reason for
its institution, it should, by necessity, have a more logical sys-
tem in its implementation,

This feature deals with stimula-
tion: the stimulation of men’s minds,
It singles out individual faces from
our fluid masses to form a potpourri
of opinions given as answers to vary-
ing questions.

The following are the candid re-
sponse to the question asked in lieu
of the importance of September 17
(whatever that may be): “What is
your impression of Washington and
Lee?”

Bo Hopson, °74, Louisville, Ky.
“I enjoy it. I find it easy to live un-
der the honor system. There is time
for social life and academics are
easily accomplished.”

Matthew Towns '74, Chuckatuck,
Va. “People take simple situations
and make them difficult. At first
everyone was living on false pre-
tenses. Now people are living easier;
there is no compulsion to greet one
another. I was somewhat confused at
first, but now that I am becoming
familiar with university life, I think
it is a great school.”

John Luster '74, Natchitoches, La.
“It's ramifications are obvious. |
think it augurs well.”

Wayne Baker '74, Annapolis, Md.
“Lam not too much disappointed. I
have not had any lengthy assign-

ments. I do suppose that the exams
will be hard. The school aided me
during the summer and Dean John
has taken a sincere interest in my
course selections. The people here
show strong compassion,”

Steve Erikson °74, Philadelphia,
Pa. “Does anyone have a spare cig-
arette? I really don’t feel like going
to my room.”

Leslie Fox '72, Boston, Mass. (Ex-
change from Hollins). “Academically
it has given me many opportunities I
could not have gotten anywhere else.
Basically everyone here is nice. Hi!
Jim. There is some hostility towards

having females on campus from both
students and professors. I would hate
to see either W&L or Hollins go
coed, but the experimental exchange
program is fine.”

Dr. Porter, Assistant Professor of
History. “I've been here such a short
time that I am not sure that I can
give an answer. In the few times that
I have met my classes, I feet the stu-
dents are really top drawer. Return-
ing to W&L, I have noticed the dis-
appearance of a few traditions, one
such being that of greeting one an-
other. There appears to be a certain
lack of friendliness,

Dr. Bryant, Instructor in Biology.
“Washington and Lee as far as |
can tell from the short time i have
been here is very conducive to .earn-
ing. From the stand point of the sci-
ences, the big university has better
equipment than the smaller one.
This is due to government grants
and research projects,

“ve been quite impressed with
President Huntley and the beauty of
W&L. I might add that women
could do much for the atmosphere.

“One last thing, remind those peo-
ple at the newspaper office that |
have my Ph.D.”

Foreign Study Dreams Become Realities

BY PROF. DICKENS

Foreign study sponsored by Wash-
ington and Lee seemed a very re-
mote possibility a couple years ago.
Now, however, it is reality. In the
past it was possible for qualified
students to spend time abroad un-
der the auspices of foreign study pro-
grams offered by other colleges and
universities, Credit for their work
was transferred back to W&L as is
regularly done for summer work.

This year things have changed. A

McCormick Growth:
Books--& a Building

BY MACK WOODWARD

McCormick Library is beginning
its third year under the supervision
of Librarian Maurice Leach. The
past two years have been part of a
period of great change and growth
in the library.

For the first time since 1957, the
library budget has approached the
figure established by the American
Library Association. The Associa-
tion recommends that the library
budget allocated be somewhere
around 5 per cent of the total univer-
sity operating budget. The fiscal year
1969-1970 saw the increase to 4.9
per cent of the total University bud-
get by the library budget.

As well as an increase in budget
allocations, the library has increased
its volumes of books and magazines
considerably. During fiscal 1969-
1970, the library purchased 8428
volumes of books and 751 maga-
zines. This compares to 4471 books
and 672 magazines in fiscal 1968-
1969. Total money spent on books
and magazines jumped from $55,263
in 68-69 to $122,183 in 69-70,

The added purchases by the library
have increased the total resources
available to 225,263 books, 72,330
government documents, and 2331
microfilm reels in all the branch
libraries and the central McCormick
facility.

New features of library in the
past year include the purchase of
the microfilm reader printout which
enables readers of the microfilm to
make copies of the film. The library
has also, because of student demand,
been able to open earlier on Sunday
afternoon and stay open later during
exam periods.

The anticipation of a new library
facility has brought change to the
existing library committees. Last
year the chairman of the Student
Library Committee was appointed
to the Faculty Library Committee.
According to Mr, Leach, this has
proved beneficial to the Faculty
Commitiee as it has presented a stu-
dent's point of view in connection

with the library policy and the plans
for the new library.

The Library Building Committee
has been busy determining library
service policy matters, as well as
visiting other college library facili-
ties, including Colorado College,
Washington University, Amherst,
and Tufts, in order to determine bet-
ter how the new library should be
organized.

The new library, which is still in
the tentative planning stages, should
be a more modern, usable facility
that the existing McCormick struc-
ture. It will hopefully be organized
to be used as a teaching facility as
well as a research facility.

Work has been done this summer
to the archives room, and rare books
and the archives are one step fur-
ther toward classification and ac-
cessability. The Crenshaw Fund, es-
tablished last year in memory of Dr.
Crenshaw, will be available soon for
the use of more work in the archives.

One problem faced by the library
is the loss of books. Inventory taken
over the summer revealed that sev-
eral volumes of references books
had been removed from the library.
Removal of such books, which is a
violation of the library rules, is
causing a problem in that these
books are parts of sets, and cannot
be replaced individually; another
whole set of books must be ordered
as books cannot be replaced indivi-
dually.

Included on this year's Standing
Library Committee are Chip Harris,
Chairman, Mack Woodward, Stacy
Eastland, Marvin Brooke, John Tuc-
ker, Jim Zeppieri, and Bill Miller.
A freshman representative will be
chosen by the Student Body Execu-
tive Committee following Freshman
Class elections in a few weeks.

The group works closely with Mr.
Leach in sponsoring Library func-
tions, Included among these have
been several teas and visitations dur-
ing Parents’ Weekend. A program
for the Class of 1974 supervised
tours of McCormick Library during
Freshman Orientation Week.

number of W&L students will spend
the six-week spring term in France,
Germany, and Spain.

After many months of planning
that included a questionnaire that
sought to gather student ideas and
Suggestions about foreign study,
three W&L professors engaged in
“university business” spent part of
their summer in Europe to make ar-
rangements for the 1971 spring term.

Armed with facts, figures, and en-
thusiasm, Professors Drake (for the
French program in Paris), Williams
(the Spanish program in Madrid),
and Dickens (the German program
in Bayreuth) are now converting in-
tangible ideas and hopes into the
concrete realities of the spring acti-
Vities,

The programs are basically simi-
lar. Participants will live in families
of the host countries. They will at-
tend classes organized for them, run
partly by the accompanying W&L
professor and partly by teachers of
the foreign schools with which ar-
rangements were made this summer.

The formal classwork will con-
tinue language study; it will be sup-
plemented by special lectures design-
ed to enable the student to derive the
fullest possible benefits from his six-
week immersion in a foreign culture.

Bayreuth is a town of 64,000 lo-
cated in Northern Bavaria, easily
allowing for trips to Czechoslovakia
and East Germany. The town has no
concentration of foreign students and
presents, thereby, an actual view of
German life. Bayreuth is a reservoir
of rich cultural resources; its associa-
tion with Wagner will provide the
WAL students with in interesting
background. Toward the end of the
program, a five day excursion to
Nurnberg is planned.

A cumulative average of 2.5, the
completion of a second year langu-
age course, and the approval of the
Foreign Study Committee is requir-
ed of those students wishing to take
part in the program.

There will be time during the pro-
gram for independent travel. The

German students may find that there
will be snow still on the ground, So
they may be able to do some skiing
in the first few weeks after their ar-
rival in Bayreuth.

The six credits granted for success-
ful completion of the program break
down into three credits for language
work and three for a topic or inde-
pendent study project that the stu-
dent will have developed in advance
with the assistance of the department
of his major and the foreign langu-
age department concerned,

Day-long and weekend excursions
are planned to supplement and en-
rich the purely academic program,
but there will still be ample time for
the participants to move about on
independent voyages of discovery on
their own,

Complete details of the programs
are available from any member of
the French, German and Spanish de-
partments. The cost of the program
is $900, to be paid in addition to re-
gular full tuition. With the experi-
ence to be gained this year, it may be
possible to reduce expenses in the
future.

Because many advances must be
made, interested students should see
a member of the department in
whose department program they are
interested. Students interested in the
Spanish or French program should
contact those departments by Oct.
20, Those interested in the German
program should contact Professor
Dickens before Nov. 20.

A first-hand report on life and
study abroad will be available short-
ly from W&L students who spent
last year in France and Sweden. The
planners of the spring program hope
to benefit by the experiences of these
students in making plans for next
spring. An announcement of general
information, to be made in the
Cockpit, will be given shortly.

Students wishing to remain in Eu
rope after the programs end will re-
ceive a refund for the return trip.
They must make their own reserva-
tions for the return trip,

Letters to the Editor

Response to Raetz

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Though most of you were prob-
ably amused at “The Rush from Fra-
ternity” by Greg Raetz in last week's
The Ring-tum Phi, there may be
some who were deceived by the pres-
entation of the fraternity issue “thro-
ugh a spyglass darkly.” Thus, at the
risk of being obvious I would like to
answer the charges presented by
Mr. Raetz and bring out the more
pertinent issues in the anti-fraternity

movement,

Mr. Raetz first charges the admini-
stration with being anti-fraternity.
This all-encompassing generalization
is far from fair as is any overall in-
dictment of the fraternity system,
The truth lies somewhere closer to
the fact that there is a noticeable de-
cline in pro-fraternity feeling within
the administration. This, however,
does not mean that the administra-
tion is out to destroy the fraternity
system,

As Mr. Raetz so dramatically
pointed oul, the destruction of the
spirit behind fraternity can probably
never be completely eradicated. Part
of that spirit is human gregarious-
ness. However, the administration is
out to provide a pleasant alternative
to fraternity membership. Mr, Raetz
points out some of these efforts to
make life for non-fraternity men
more desirable. His attitude is that
this alternative is a direct attack on
on This sounds almost para-
noid.

Another revealing complaint for
Mr. Raetz is his attitude toward the
extended rush program. He says dis-
aster might befall the houses because
of the absence of freshmen dues for
two months, Any house standing so
freely that its existence depended on
the two months of freshmen dues
might be considered a poor risk for
freshmen seeking their haven of
happiness for the next four years,
The real disaster will probably be the
smaller pledge classes because the

freshmen will have had a consider-
ably longer look at the houses. It is
difficult to maintain that friendly,
frozen-faced facade for seven weeks.

Actually, it seems that Mr, Raetz's
analysis of anti-fraternity sentiment
falls quite short of piercing insight.
It seems that he is trying to misdi-
rect opinion from the real issues by
pointing to conservatism and anti-
intellectualism as the chief reasons
for anti-fraternity sentiment. Of
course anyone knows that you will
find conservatives and liberals, and
intellectuals and anti-intellectuals,
within any group,

The more real basic reasons for re-
jection of the fraternity system might
be widespread instances of hypo-
crisy, falsehood, dehumanization, an-
ti-individualism and materialism.
Now I want to make it clear that |
don't accuse the system as a whole of
being guilty of these charges. I do
charge that this type of action and
attitude is widespread.

There are fraternities who still
have the image and ideal of what a
fraternity can be and strive for that.

If a freshman joins a house which
has presented the standard facade
and later finds inflated house bills
and initiation fees out of proportion
to what was promised in rush, uni-
formity in thought and action en-
forced by the caustic tongues of
“brothers,” sadistic and childish haz-
ing where none is acknowledged or
allowed, and lack of respect for the
rights and feelings of “brothers,”
that individual will probably fee!
duped and rejection will be the re-
action.

The facade of fraternities in con-
trast to the realities is hard to ra
tionalize and digest. These are some
of the reasons that fraternities might
feel anti-fraternity sentiment to be
overwhelming them. It is up to the
fraternities to change and change fast
and it is up to the University to pre-
sent a clear and pleasant alternative
to fraternity membership

' Through a Spyglass Darkly ...

Wheels Of Change

BY GREG RAETZ

Just about the first thing W&L stu-
dents do upon their return to Lexing-
ton is determine the changes which
have occurred in town and on camp-
us. This September being no excep-
tion, it seems likely that by now
everyone knows that the Robert E.
‘Lee Hotel is just as elegant and that
McCrum’s is just as fashionable as
they were when we left Lexington in
June.

However, there have been a few
changes which are notable. For those
who haven't visited Kenny's, and
for those who have and didn’t no-
tice, the do-it-yourself car wash is
no more. (What great timing! Now
that there is a real need for a car
wash with all of the dust created by
the excavations on Jefferson Street
it has been torn down.) The bake
shop with its “intellectaul” clientele
has moved around the corner to
Main Street. In its place stands the
Revolutionary “Bakery” with its sin-
gle arm chair, telephone, and ex-
pansive shelves complete with a
dozen books .

On campus the white columns and
Romulus Weatherman’s seersucker
sport coats remain, but there have
been changes underway here, too.
The base of The Hill, where last year
elementary school children played

during recess, is being converted
into more parking space.

On the fashion scene, the new look
seems to be imported from Egypt.
While the Afro haircut is still “in”,
there is an increasing trend among
students, and alas faculty, to let
their hair grow in such a manner that
they look like sphinxes.

Perhaps the biggest changes which
face returning students have been
promulgated by the W&L admini-
stration. Due to gym construction,
there would be a_ severe parking
shortage, so obviously something
had to be done to accommodate stu-
dents and faculty who drive cars to
class. In a lengthy publication sent
out over the summer the new park-
ing regulations were explained to
the students.

At a time when it seems obvious
that what we need is fewer cars and
not more, it has been decreed that
freshmen may have cars. These cars
must be kept in a distant lot, which
may help traffic congestion, but also
makes them easy targets for petty
theives.

Since parking space is at such a
premium, one would expect that
new parking areas would be con-
structed with much haste. The sad
fact is that after three months the
Jefferson Street lot is still under con-
struction and progressing slowly.
Finally, a $15 parking fee is being
charged to all students who wish to
use university facilities. There is no
value in this assessment because
many students live at a distance
from the campus and they must
drive cars to class. So why the fee?

With friends in the administration
who needs enemies?

Hendrix, The Beatles & Us

BY ROBERT BAROODY

Today is 1970, and if you don’t be-
lieve it read the papers: Nixon is
president, Humphrey is running,
Hendrix is dead. Yes folks, Jimi
Hendrix pushed some smack into his
brains . . . blowing them away. And
we on the planet of earth can’t un-
derstand why he did it.

We even have the nerve to shake
our heads saying, “Man, Hendrix
was really messed up”; and then we
try to remember if this was the guy
who once said that you didn’t need
drugs to get out of your mind, that
music could replace acid. Hendrix
said it, and he was right. His music.

For Hendrix heroin was only the
crash to a_ self-destructive power
trip that we asked for and that he
was willing to provide. Hendrix
played God for us.

He educated us; defined words
like psychedelic and _ electricity;
taught musicians how to use a guitar;
and he gave us our National An-
them. When Hendrix gave so much
we greedily asked for more, hardly
noticing the gradual metamorphosis
of a man becoming a corpse. As the
shows piled up it seemed that Hen-
drix was the thing they plugged into
the stage. He could see the change
and accepted it as a wild man’s fate.
At the age of twenty-three he said,
“Will I live tomorrow? Well, I don’t
know for sure, but I’m gonna live
today... .”

Finally, the feedback came in too
strong; Hendrix couldn’t give us
what he wanted to give, so at 24
years, sometimes looking closer to
80, he decided to die.

Meanwhile, at the Lyric Cinema,
four sometime gods tell us to “let
it be.” Long insulated from the
masses by their Saville Row record-
ing studio, the Beatles had options
that were unavailable to Hendrix. As
we know they chose corporate death;
and I don't mean this in a critical
sense. We can no more ridicule the
Beatles for their actions as we can
disavow our subculture which they
helped to create.

The film itself is no cinematic
wonder, We are simply offered a
parting glimpse of four men being
themselves at a recording session for
the “Let It Be” album. If McCart-
ney gets the most camera exposure,
it is George Harrison who is techni-
cally the most impressive. Now, with

 

_-

more time to spend on his own com-
positions, Harrison might well be-
come the first Beatle to make the
step from musical proficiency to
brilliance.

(I haven't seen Yellow Submarine
since it arrived here two years ago,
but I can easily remember this fea-
ture-length cartoon as the most ori-
ginal product of the genre, save
Mickey Mouse. If you like colored
fairy tales see it, otherwise you may
become bored.)

Thus ends an era. If you are
searching for a public statement full
of political and social significance,
then don’t go to these movies. Sim-
ply walk past the Lyric and look up
at the title. This, the farewell mess-
age of the Beatles, is curiously de-
livered in a tone that Bob Dylan ap-
proaches in “Self Portrait.” Like old
friends, the Beatles have always been
welcome at our mind's door, and if
they leave us looking like Santa
Claus and three elves what can we
say but happy new year.

Intramurals Revamped

BY STEVE GREEN

The intramural program is being
completely overhauled by Coach
Canfield this year. Coach Canfield
has taken the responsibility of com-
missioner in the intramural league.
Canfield stressed organization in his
discussion of the new program when
he stated that “it will be streamlined
and reformed but completely or-
ganized.

“We're not going to have a lot of
Mickey Mousing.” Fines will be
strictly enforced, and penalties won't
be light. Canfield, in this same re-
spect, made it clear that attendance
was extremely important.

Canfield also spoke of a new as-
pect of intramurals. Beginning this
year there will be indiivdual competi-
tion as well as team competition. For
the first time individuals may sign up
to play 2 man volleyabll, 3 on 3
basketball, badminton, and horse-
shoes. There will be awards in each
sport. Interested people may sign
up in the gym. There is an entrance
fee of 25 cents, Canfield said that
when the new facilities come, such
sports as water polo and squash will
be added to the program.

Another interesting facet of the
program is the set-up for team com-
petition. Beginning this year, there
will be three even leagues consisting
of Fraternity, Independent, and
Freshman teams. Up until the end of
the first semester, Freshmen will be

divided by dorm floors for competi-
tion. Each floor will be headed by a
dorm counselor. Canfield also ex-
pects the Independents and the Law
School to have two teams each.
Eventually the program will consist
of 3 leagues with six teams in each.

The scheduling of events has also
taken a turn. There will not be any
competition on Friday and none on
Mondays after big weekends. Also,
there will be a bulletin board in the
gym devoted entirely to Intramural
activities.

rhis year there also has been a
change in the Intramural board. The
board will consist of two students, a
faculty advisor, Coaches Canfield
and Corrigan. The responsibilities
will then be delegated from the
board to individual students. Officials
will be an organization controlled
by Canfield. Canfield stressed that
the officials will be extremely com-
petent for the games. There will be
an intramural office upstairs in the
gym and all equipment will be strict-
ly controlled for sole use in competi-
tion. Canfield said that football will
begin with six new balls. Equipment
will be the best Canfield can get.

The first part of the season will
consist of football, tennis, and cross
country. Competition begins Mon-
day.

The program has been set up to
have a promising future. “This year

BY ROB LARUE

As inevitable as death and taxes,
football has returned to preoccupy
once more sports pages and televi-
sion sets across the country. With the
grid season but one weekend old (or
to fudge a bit, six weeks including
the exhibitions), all eyes seem to be
turned to pro contests and collegiate
clashes.

Meanwhile, one of the most eycit-
ing pennant races is being waged in
the lower central column of most
local newspapers. Although — the
Orioles and Reds have clinched their
respective divisions, and Minnesota
has all but put away its second divi-
sional championship, the National
League East remains a toss-up be-
tween the Amazin’ Mets, the surpris-
ing Pittsburgh Pirates and those per-
ennial also Orans, the Chicago Cubs,
The Pirates, who are so pitcher-poor
that they could almost go on a wel-
fare program, have successfully been
able to forestall the New York nine
with a make-shift mound corps of
little-kKnowns and almost-forgottens,
thanks in large part to an awsome
assemblage of hitters.

Leo’s Cubs have been playing a
nip and tuck game of catch-up, only
to be set back just percentage poinis
out of first. Although the schedule
favors the Bruins, most of the money
is on the Mets and the Bucs. The
finish will probably be decided this
weekend by a four-game face-off be-
tween the Pirates and Gil Hodges’

 

wonders...

And speaking of baseball, Coach
Joe Lyles is making arrangements
for a brief fall season with neighbor
ing Virginia Military and possibly
Lynchburg or Virginia. Also, rumor
has it that the 1971 ball club will be
taking their talents to Texas at spring
vacation instead of Florida. Many

 

schools will have played the Grape- — 7

fruit circuit and returned norih by
the time W&L gets out of cxams,
April 10.

Heard here and there ... a lol of
money changed hands this weekend
in a rash of football upsets. Among
the most notable were Tulane over
Georgia, Texas A&M over LSU, that
Southern Cal.—Nebraska tie, and,
among the pros, the Bengals victory
over Oakland and Detroit's pastirg
of the Packers . . . Kudos te sopho-
more safety Marshall Washburn for
a sensational performance against
Emory and Henry.

. Saturday marked the first
Washington and Lee football game

in quite a while to lack a Kumpuris &

in the lineup. Drew K., the younger

half of that Little Rock wrestling ~~

crew, was felled earlier this month
by a knee injury and is out for the
season, bad luck for a competitor
like Drew... but defensive coach
Boyd Williams cannot complain
about his starting four linebackers,
Frank Evans, Ken Carter, and a pair
of coming sophomores, George Har-
ris and Tim Haley.

Booters Face Dickinson

BY PETER JONES

Washington and Lee looks for a
big finish this year as coach Lyles
returns plenty of experience, talent,
and youth from a 7-2-2 club of iast
year,

With two years of greuling condi-
tioning and practice behind them the
varsity has built up a polished at-
tack and defense behind the veteran
senior captains, Mark Sayres and
Carl Hyatt and sophomore sensa-
tions Meade Kampfmeuiler and
Hank Slauson. They lead the team
into its first Va. inter-Soccer Associa-
tion game this Friday at Dickenson.

Last year, vitually the same team
carried itself to the NCAA regionals
at Springfield, Mass. only to be halt-
ed in the first round. Coach Lyles un-
topped in flamboyancy sees tremen-
dous potential in his young team
laden with an abundance of talented
sophomores and freshmen. The next
few years could prove to be the best
soccer Washington and Lee has seen
in a while.

rhe freshman team, as yet without
a coach, has constantly scrimmaged
the varsity the past week and will
open its season next week. Five of
the twelve game varsity schedule
games are home, on the soccer field
that doubles as a parking lot during
football games.

The tough games seem to be the

On Murphing, Hunting, Cruising, and Things —

There’s a new sport on campus this year.
not officially labelled, it’s
“dodging” or “Murphing.” You play it with

Though called
your car, and the object is to park your un-
registered vehicle within five minutes of your
class. It’s a great spectator sport, especially
when someone is caught: “Uh, Murph, | was
just dropping these guys off...” or “I was
going to pick up some materials .. .” To say
the least, few people have succeeded at the
sport.

Someone told me of a freshman who had
all his courses on MWF, except P.L. which
he has on TT, Let’s hear it for P.1é.

For all you hunters, here are the seasons

This summer, I was fortunate enough to
visit the “Incredible,” which is the race com-
mittee boat for the America Cup Races. It is
truly incredible: 70 feet long, draws 4 feet
and has a top speed of 36 knots. The control
room Was just amazing—two radars, automa-
tic pilot, omni and a small navigational/trou-
ble-shooting computer, Totally air condition-
ed, a galley with a radar oven ete, ete. It was
built by Hatteras and was just sold for a half
million dollars. Oh well.

Archie Manning had 200 total yards and
was 15 for 19 on Saturday. Funny thing is that
he only played the first half. Watch Ole Miss!

During the Emory and Henry game, the General defense mustered a goal line stand late in the third quarter.
However the Washington and Lee squad was not able to put enough points on the board as they lost 27-14.

BY PALMER TRICE
AND ERIC WHITE

The Generals opened the 1970
football season on a dismal note,
dropping a 27-14 decision to a big,
tough Emory and Henry squad. The
younger, smaller Blue and White
were unable to halt the consistent
ground game of the Wasps.

Using their size to good advant-
age, the Wasps gained over 300 yards
on the ground alone. The Generals
defense had trouble containing the
quarterback option, which the Emory
and Henry offense used to score two
TD's. Wayne Neese, the highly-
touted Little All-American bulldozed
for 200 yards, and 3 TD's, on 42
carries.

Emory and Henry opened the scor-
ing in the first period, Neese going
around left end from 4 yards out.
Another Wasp march was stopped
on an interception by sophomore
linebacker George Harris. The theft
was made inside the W&L 10, just
as the gun sounded to end the first
quarter.

Early in the second quarter, Wasp
placekicker Wilson kicked a 45 yard
field goal, making the score 10-0,
With about two minutes left in the
first half, Tommy Van Amburgh
stepped back and hurled a 48 yard
pass to wide receiver Steve Mahaffey.
Moments later, Quarterback Van
Amburgh left the pocket and scurried
15 yards to the end zone. The clock
showed 1:36 left in the half. The
Generals looked as if they were back
in the ballgame.

The Blue and White defense
toughened in the third period. How-
ever, the offense failed to materialize.
Early in the final quarter, the Wasp
All-American again scored on an op-
tion, this time from two yards out,
Ihe Generals stormed back on a
69 yard pass, Van Amburgh to Ma-
haffey, this time for six points, With
8:52 remaining in the game, the
score was EAH 17—WA&L 14,

The Wasp offense, however, took
the kickoff and refused to be stopped.
Neese scored his third TD with 4:20
left in the game. With 11 seconds
left, Wilson added a 37 yard field
goal to his credit.

The 27-14 score does not reflect
the outstanding performance handed
in by the Washington and Lee de-
fense. Emory and Henry consistently
came up with the big play on third
down situations, converting success-
fully on 13 such plays. Due in part
to the Wasp defense, and in part to

W&L Drops Tough Opener

the lack of a consistent W&L of-
fense, Emory and Henry ran off
twice as many offensive plays as the
Generals. Three fumbles and three
interceptions proved very costly to
the chances of a General victory.
Washington and Lee will be a
decided underdog Saturday after-
noon when they face the visiting
Towson State College at Wilson
Field. Kickoff will be at 2:00 p.m.
The Generals must bolster their
offense in order that they compete
with the Tigers, who were practically
untested in demolishing Gallaudet,
29-0, in their opener last Saturday.

WAL received a stalwart perfor-
mance from their defense in last
week's contest against the Wasps.
This level of performance must be
maintained against Towson. Particu-
lar standouts last week were Safety
Marshall Washburn, who intercept-
ed a pass and made 16 unassisted
tackles, and linebacker Frank Evans,
who made 16 individual tackles and
helped in 11 others. The aerial de-
fense did a fine job, giving up but 70
yards, and intercepting 2 passes.
But offensively, the Generals showed

 

little other than the pass-catching of
end Steve Mahaffey. The Columbus,
Ohio senior snagged four for 147
yards, including two Van Amburgh
bombs. A ground game must be
found to go with the quick striking
aerial combination. The Generals
gained only 71 yards on the ground
against Emory and Henry.

WAL will be facing many of the
same Towson personnel who dropp
ed a narrow 14-13 decision to our
gridmen last year. Quarterback Al
Dodds and running back Dennis
Champney, who gained most of the
yardage last time out, are joined by
a tough senior fullback, Randy
Canal, the workhouse against Gal-
laudet.

WAL scout Syd Walden’s report
was terse: “Towson is better than
Emory and Henry.” That could eas-
ily mean bad news for the Generals,

THE RING-TUM PHI

Development Office

In Lee-Jackson Home

Ihe historic Lee-Jackson House
on the campus is the new temporary
home for the university's develop-
ment office.

The house was occupied until this
summer by Mr, and Mrs. Charles P.
Light. Mr. Light, a professor of law,
is the former dean of the School of
Law.

The Lee-Jackson House will again
be occupied by a university dean in
the near future, according to univer-
sity officials. At that time, other
space will become available for the
development office.

Traditionally, deans or senior fac-
ulty members and their families live
in the stately, ante-bellum houses on
Washington and Lee’s front campus.

The development office simply out-
grew its old quarters, which consist-
ed of three small rooms, a vault and
a closet on the ground floor of Wash-
ington Hall, the main adminmstra-
tion building. The development staff
of seven, plus extensive records and
a great deal of machinery had been
previously accommodated in that
small space as well.

The Lee-Jackson House was Gen.
Robert E. Lee’s residence in Lexing-
ton until a house was specially built
for him and Mrs. Lee, next door on
the Washington College campus.

Before Lee was elected president
of Washington College, Thormas
“Stonewall” Jackson had lived in
the house for a time. Jackson, a pro-
fessor of engineering at neighboring
Virginia Military Institute, married
Margaret Junkin, whose father was
president of Washington College

Troubadours To Hold Auditions,
Open Season With “Billy Budd”

BY LARRY PATTERSON

The Troubadours of Washington
and Lee can look forward to a “very
challenging season, according to Mrs.
O. K. Barnes, the theater's director
for 1970-71. The productions offer-
ed this winter and spring will range
from an ancient Greek drama to a
modern Off-Broadway play.

The season will open on Novem-
ber 4 with “Billy Budd,” an adapta-
tion of Herman Melville's sea clas-
sic. The play will boast a cast of
thirty, providing ample opportunity
for all interested to try out for a
role.

Auditions for this production will
be held at the Troubadour Theater
on both Thursday and Friday be-
tween 4:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., ac-
cording to Dave Christovitch, the
seasonal stage manager.

The group's second production
will be Tom Stoppard’s 1968 Off-
Broadway success, “Rosenkrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead.” The play,
winner of the New York Drama Cri-
tic’s Award, is scheduled to open
February 10.

ing considered. These programs
would be of a continuing nature.

Weekend dialogues and guest
speakers are among other projected
activities. The first weekend dialo-
gue is to be on the topic of suicide.
In the dialogues, a university profes-
sor or other qualified person will
lead non-structured sessions on a
topic of his choosing.

Free University is hoping to re-
new the 11 a.m. Sunday coffee speak-
ers in the Student Union building
and use the time for experimental
worship forms. The Student Center
and the Religion Department have
funds for this purpose.

Money and student and faculty in-
terest are short at this time for Free
University activities. Letters have
been sent out to faculty members,
requesting suggestions and asking
for volunteers to lead courses or one-
night dialogues. Students who are in-
terested in further information about

leading a course or dialogue should
contact Steve Haughney.

According to Steve, “The main
thrust of the Free University will be
derived from student response. If
the students do not respond, Free
University has not failed—the stu-
dents have failed.”
