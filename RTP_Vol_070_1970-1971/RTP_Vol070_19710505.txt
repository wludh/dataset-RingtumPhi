Burks Court Final Highlights
W&L Law Weekend Plans

What will happen when a nation-
ally known real estate developer
sues a pharmaceutical company and
a chemical corporation for polluting
a 20-acre lake in the middle of his
residential district? Add to this the
fact that the polluting agent, being
dumped in the tributary Moory
River, is the basic ingredient for a
male contraceptive injection, known
as Exaspirin, and one has the mak-
ings of a very engaging controversy.

Despite these humorous overtones,
however, this legal dilemma will be-
come the focus of some very serious
and sophisticated courtroom argu-
ment this Friday in the finals of the
Burks Moot Court Competition. The
case involving environmental pro-
iection will be heard by three jus-
tices of the Virginia Supreme Court
of Appeals, the initial event in a

series of activities slated this week-
end in honor of Law Day.

On Saturday May 8 the 23rd an-
nual John Randolph Tucker Law
Lecture will be delivered by Chief
Judge J. Edward Lumbard of the
Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
The topic of his address will be
“Trial by Jury and More Speedy

The finals of the Burks Moot
Court Competition provides the cul-
mination of a year's work for the
Law School freshmen. The final
round of the competition began with
24 freshmen debaters who had been
selected from preliminary rounds.

nation procedure, until the four men

Calendar Policy Altered

The University Council has been
delegaied the responsibility to work
out the details of the University’s
academic calendar. The faculty in
its meeting Monday decided to give
the University Council this task.
Starting with the 1972-73 year the
student-faculfty-administration body
will determine dates for vacations,
holidays and examinations.

The faculty however retains con-
trol over broader policies concerning
the calendar such as the term system
and the length of the terms. The
Faculty Executive Committee will
continue to work out the mechanics
of the academic calendar but the
University Council must approve the

Dean Lewis John, a spokesman

anics. The University Council will
accept or reject or amend the pro
posals. The council can get as involv

ings of establishing a calendar. The
faculty basically has delegated some
of its authority in this matter to the
University Council.”

Council

The University Council has adopt-
ed a statement on the Independent
‘Exam Schedule and approved a pol-
icy statement on drugs. In other ac-
tion Saturday morning the council
elected Student Body President Steve
Robinson and University President
R.E.R. Huntley as co-chairmen of
the council.

After a closed session the council
studied a proposed Student Affairs
Committee policy statement on
drugs. The SAC was seeking the
council's opinion on the drug situa-
tion.

Professor Thomas Imeson  sug-
gested re-writing of the policy state-
ment to “create better avenues of
communication.” He expressed the
view that this improvement of com-
munications could be accomplished
by assuring students that they would
ibe subject to no reprisals for ad-
mitting their problems to the admini-
stration,

After minor changes in the policy
statement, it was approved unani-
mously. Representatives on the coun-
cil from the SAC asked that the do-
cument be printed in the Student
Handbook and also be mailed to all
students.

The text of the SAC Policy state-
ment on drugs read in part:

“Washington and Lee University
wants to help the individual achieve
a realistic understanding of the con-
sequences of drug use and the abil-
ity to make informed, responsible
decisions. The University’s prime re-
sponsibilities concerning drugs are
education and counseling. Consis-
tent with these responsibilities, the
University wishes to create an en-
vironment in which students may
discuss drug problems openly and
without fear of reprisal. The Uni-
versity, to foster this environment.
will sponsor regular seminars on
drugs and drug use as well as offer
counseling assistance at all times.
In addition, McCormick Library
and the University Center will main-
tain special collections of literature
on drugs.

“Students sincerely interested in re-
solving personal drug problems may
seek guidance from University phy-
sicians, the Dean of Students, and
his staff; in seeking such aid, stu-
denis may rest assured they do not
risk disciplinary action. Although
conversations with these persons do
not enjoy immunity from court in-
quiry, they are under no obligation
to initiate reporting of drug offenses
and would do so only in clearly dan-
gerous and extraordinary situations.

University Council:
Some Solutions

The recently instituted University Council has surely es-
tablished a favorable impression. From all appearances this
body seems to offer some solutions to the myriad of questions
facing W&L. This group has allowed students and members
of the faculty to confront each other on issues involving the
university. More importantly, this body possesses the power
to alleviate existing problems and avert possible problems in
the future.

Two major problems were openly and articulately mastered
by the council this weekend. The first involved Independent
Exams. By an overwhelming vote, the University Council
endorsed the independent procedure and staved off any im-
mediate possibility of reinstating the old system. Drugs and
the role of the university was the second problem to be ex-
amined. The council approved a policy that expounded the
risks of the students using drugs, plus the position the school
would adhere to in drug problems. It should be noted that the
council recommended a sympathetic and workable policy to-
ward drug users who seek help.

The above pair of answers has been long needed. Until
now the students and faculty members lacked a clear under-
standing of how other people connected with the university
felt about these problems. Now with expediency and clarity
these questions have been dealt with.

The University Council is sizeable (over 20 members) and
for the most part composed of interested individuals. Opinions
expressed in Saturday's session were diverse, and sincere. The
members of the council shared a single desire—to protect the
best interests of Washington and Lee University.

Perhaps the most refreshing attitudes were presented by
the faculty and administration members. As one student dele-
gate admitted after the meeting, “they really care; they are
serious about getting things done.”

Why should the faculty members not care? W&L is their
school too. Quite candidly, the faculty members did care and
were better prepared for discussion of issues than the students
who attended.

What about parietals? Is coeducation feasible or even de-
sirable? How fair is the current grading system’ These are
some questions that await solutions from the University
Council.

_ the recently instituted University Council has surely
established a favorable impression. Yet, first impressions are
often misleading. It is hoped that the initial impressions given
by the University Council will not follow this adage. Too many
problems need answers.

There was a University Council meeting Saturday morn-
ing. This may be news to Mr. Bruce Madison, Mr. Don Weir,
Mr. Marshall Washburn, Mr. Rob Schatz, and Mr. Hap Stein.
These gentlemen did not quite make it to the session.

You may wonder how many of the ancient, aloof, and
apathetic faculty members were present? The answer is that
all 17 faculty members attended the meeting.

It was revealed this week that
some twenty-eight girls are planning
to attend W&L next year under the
exchange program involving eight
single-sex colleges in Vinginia and
North Carolina. According to Dean
William J. Watt, W&L’s program
supervisor, Hollins College will be
most heavily represented, alomg with
several students from Mary Baldwin
College,, Randolph-Macon Woman’s
College and Sweet Briar Colleges.

 

There is but one W&L student
participating in the program next
year, sophomore Bruce David Lorch,
who plans to further his Religion
study at Sweetbriar.

planning to study here next year has
been somewhat fluid in recent weeks,
and plans could be changed for a

Goshen Classic Returns,

After a year’s layoff, Washington
and Lee's famous Goshen Tubing
Classic is trying to make a come-
back. The classic, which in past years
was put on by the IFC and limited to
entrants from indiivdual fraternities,
will this year be put on by the Stu-
dent Committee for Planning and
Development and will be open to
all, inchiding girls and couples who
wish to enter the race.

Ihe reason for the change in spon-
sorship is due to the formation of
the new committee and the duties it
must try and perform. The commit-
tee’s sole purpose is to try and raise
money for the university through
joint student action. The group is in
the process of trying to raise $1000
in the next six weeks; if that amount
can be raised it will be matched by
an interested donor.

who came to W&L for the first year
of the program. The chairman of
the exchange consortium, Mary
Baldwin’s Dr. Mink has concluded,
both from surveys taken throughout
the year and from comments receiv-
ed from this year’s participants, that
generally the program has been an
encouraging success.

No one can seem to detenmine the
reason for the relatively small num-
ber of male participants in the pro-
gram, but Dean Watt pointed out
that this has been generally the case,
not only at W&L, but at Davidson
and other male colleges in the con-

of courses in his major at Sweet

idea was vetoed by his parents.

BY MARC SMALL

It has been said that every genera-
tion produces its own ‘barbarians,
and ours is as afflicted as any: our
Vandals now burn ROTC ‘buildings
instead of libraries, our Goths now
kill police officers rather than Rom-
an legionaries, and our Huns now
ravage Berkeley and San Rafael in-
stead of Italy, but the sentiment is
identical. We have raised and toler-
ated that generation of vipers in our
midst whose lawless disrespect for
reality and logic are rapidly widen-
ing the cracks in our society and has-
tening the eventual return of the
Dark Ages.

These new barbarians display all
the attributes of those that toppled
the senile Roman Empire: they are
leaches on a society that they can
not understand and which they will
eventually leave, a dry husk, to shine
through the eons as “the glory that
was Rome.” They brag of their
alienation, of their lack of under-
standing of the complexities our cul-
ture has developed in its five thous-
and years of development. They are
proud of their inability to add to the
accomplishments of the society they
work so hard to destroy. It is a diffi-
cult and subtle thing to realize the
complete break these barbarians
have made with our technological
past: they have not only left the
world of mechanical progress, but
they utilize their full abilities to
bring ovr industrial world to its
knees while enjoying the benefits of
mass production motorcycles and
dope smuggled in aircraft.

less vociferous in their criticisms of
the plan as have some of the female
participants. However, Lorch added,
“I don’t think it’s going to be a vaca-
tion, by any means.”

The vast majority of the exchange
coeds at W&L next year will remain
for all three academic terms, ac-
cording to Dean Watt, but two or
three have registered only for a sin-
gle term. Several of the girls were
motivated to come to W&L by
courses in the department of jour-
nalism an dcommunications. In ad-
dition, the girl’s courses will mainly
comprise English, the fine arts, and
psychology.

Exactly what the program means
for W&L beyond adding a few pretty
faces to the campus scene is uncer-
tain. The administration does not see
the program as any prelude to a
more ambitious co-ed experience in
the future, but Dean Watt said that
one virtue of the program, besides
providing a wider variety of offer-
ings, is a “convenient way for us to
get some girls in the classroom.”

  

 

the physiocrat, or the health nut;
rather I condemn those hypocritical
parasites who work to the detriment
of the society that nurtures them.
It is this stark hatred of scientific
and cultural progress, this belief that
one should live through stealing the
rewards of another's labour, that
epitomizes the most vile aspects of
the barbarians, yet it is not found
alone in the mad ‘bombers or street
rabble that occasionally pollute our
capital: indeed, the small-town Bab
bitt and bureaucrat are probably as
susceptible to barbarism as Theodo
ric the Visigoth and a great deal
more conscious of the consequences
of their actions. When New York
City decides not to build any more
power stations or cables, but to force
users to cut back, when political pro-
cesses are forgotten for murder and
destruction, then the worst attributes
of both covert and overt barbarism
are displayed. In short, we live in an
age in which the dominant society no
longer is able or willing to cast oul
the gnats that afflict it and who, by
sheer weight, will eventually haul it
down.

None of wus will be alive when the
next Dark Age comes, for its advent
is still decades or centuries in the
future. Rather, we sit at the water
shed when the first cracks appear
and it becomes appareni—to the
few—that the decline and fall have
begun and it is but a matter of time
until the inexorable tide of human
progress will bring mankind into the
black night of ignorance and fea
from which there shall spring al

ley and Tim Haley placed 2-3 in the
shot and discus. Captain Bill Kahn
won the long jump with a fine leap
of 22-4 followed in second by
Paul Suthern. Curt Jamison who is
out for competition for the first
‘time since mopping up in high school
decathalon action performed ad-
mirably taking seconds in ‘both the
triple and high jump events. Sloth
Glace won the triple jump going out
42-and-a-half feet. Joining Jamison
with a sweep of the thigh jump were
winner Porter at 6-0 feet and Dave
Stone in third. In the disaster at
VMI, captain Mike Carrere easily
won the javelin with a toss of 191-
10. Porter took second in the high
jump against the Keydets with Stone

CAC Crown

Washington and Lee’s sprint
sports squad will be seeking finst
place in the overall College Athletic
Conference standings during the
course of the annual Spring Carnival

at Washington University in St.
Louis this weekend,
Competition in ‘baseball, golf,

track and tennis will complete this
year’s conference activity and decide
which of the member institutions
will take possession of the 300
pound locomotive bell that is em-
blematic of overall athletic suprem-
aey.

Ihe title appears to be a two team
race, between Washington Univer-
sity, which has won five of the prev-
ious eight competitions, and the
Generals, who ‘hold down second
place. Washington is in first place
with 95 points and is the favorite
due to its traditionally strong spring
showing and its home field advan-
tage. Washington and Lee is in sec-
ond place with 90 overall points.

taking a close third. Sanders and
Kahn took second places in the triple
and long jumps, respectively.

Super Sophomore Paul Suthern
continued his winning ways and was
the Blue’s only winner on the track
against VMI. A double winner
against Roanoke, Suthern took the
high hurdles in 15.0 and the 440
intermediates in 59.9. He again won
the highs at VMI and, as was the
case in Roanoke, Bill Wallace was
close on his theels for second. Steve
Darsie and Harry Smith rounded
out the W&L sweep of ‘the inter-
mediates at Roanoke. To the disbe-
lief of all knowledgeable spectators,
W&L won the mile relay for the first
time in over three years. Bob Sher-
wood and Paul Wilbur took 2-3 in
the mile at Roanoke and Sherwood
took third also at VMI. Freshman
Larry Alexander was called upon to
run the quarter for the first time and
responded with a 53.4 victory at
Roanoke followed by a respectable
third against the Keydets. Randy
Lehr, Gary Entsminger, and Dave
Stone were responsible for the few
remaining points gathered in the
sprints.

On The Line

Sewanee, Centre and Southwestern
follow with 6742, 65, and 57%
points respectively.

Washington gathered many of its
points with a co«<hampionship in
football and an outright crown in
cross-country. W&L gained ground
in the winter with championships in
swimming and basketball. Sewanee
won the wrestling chanypionship.

This year’s spring carnival will
add at least one new wrinkle to what
is always an exciting event, Round-
robin baseball competition will be
introduced in place of the single eli-
mination tournament system. Coach
Joe Lyles’ W&L team, coming off a
losing streak, but hopeful of im-
proved pitching, has drawn a bye in
the first day competition, and now
faces doubleheaders on Friday and
Saturday.

Seedings and pairings for tennis,
golf and track will be drawn up in
meetings in St. Louis prior to the
opening of competition.

LaRue’s Press Box

This and That

Heard here and there while -wait-
ing for the electricity to come back
on... Canonero II, Saturday's sur-
prise Kentucky Derby winner, was
not only the first foreign entry to
win the Run for the Roses, but also
the first field horse to claim victory
. . . Sadly, field status knocked the
winner's payoff down to $19.40, de-
spite 50 to 1 odds,

It should be interesting to see just
where the San Francisco Giants fin-
ish up this season. . . Their man-
ager, Clyde King predicted before
the season's start that the team
which got off to a big jump early
would most likely win the Western
Division pennant. Currently, King’s
Giants have lost only five of their
first twenty-four games, giving them
a comfortable six game lead.

Ice hockey, generally associated
with cold weather, is considered a
winter sport. And yet, with May and
warm weather's arrival, at least in
most places, one finds two National
Hockey League clubs still doing bat-
tle in a best-of-seven series for the
Stanley Cup.

Out in Indianapolis, preparations
are already underway for the fifty-
fifth Indy 500, to be run May 29.
Saturday marked the first day of
time trials and practice sessions.

Although Washington and Lee’s
baseball team is still having its
troubles winning, the Generals are
optimistic about chances for a top
spot in the CAC spring tournament
this weekend in St. Louis .. . The
diamond Generals have ‘been receiv-
ing improved pitching in their last
few outings. Haller Jackson looked
strong against Wilmington and Don
McMillan went the distance in a 5-1
loss to touted High Point... And
last Sunday, though W&L lost a pair

to Old Dominion, 5-4 and 3-1, Ellie
Gutshall looked good and Bill
Greener, throwing a four-hitter, was
most impressive .. .

Danville’s Market Garden Field,
site of last weekend's baseball ac-
tion, is a jinxed park, as far as Vir-
ginia teams are concerned .. . Two
W&L players were injured during
the weekend, and two Lynchburg
College players left a game.

W&L Ruggers
Host Tourney

Washington and Lee’s Rugby Club
will play host to its Fourth Annual
Invitational Tournament on Satur-
day and Sunday, ‘May 8 and 9. A
strong field will be on hand to test
the Generals.

Teams invited to participate in the
event, are Princeton, the Ivy League
champion, Virginia Tech, which will
carry an undefeated record into the
competition, the University of Vir-
ginia, the University of South Caro-
lina, Hampden Sydney, Virginia
Military Institute, Lynchburg Col-
lege, and the host Generals.

Both the middle and upper fields
will ‘be employed in conducting the
tournament, which is the highlight
of the club's season, and which
should furnish spectators a good
look at a fast-growing college sport.

The Washington and Lee Club
has progressed steadily this year,
with a key victory coming against
‘Hampden-Sydney two weeks ago.
The Generals downed the Tigers 5-3
on a score by Bill Anderson. The
bustle of freshman Dave Campbell
also helped the W&L victory.

 

The nationally ranked lacrosse team returns home Saturday.

UC Discusses

Drugs, Exams

(Continued from page 1)

He pointed out that 12 per cent of
the students surveyed admitted they
heard something about the examina-
tions. Atwood said, “There is less
security under the Independent
Exams as there was under the previ-
ous system. 1 am willing to accept
that but I do not want to make a
statement that the security is as good
as it was in the past. The word ‘re-
lative’ (mentioned in the statement
in relation to security of the Honor
System) upsets me.”

Professor Imeson commented “this
group is in agreement that there is
sufficient security. It seems that it is
our opinion that Independent Exam
procedure does not upset the exam
process.”

Student Body President Steve Rob-
inson added, “there is enough re-
sponsibility accepted by students for
independent exams to continue.”

The statement was approved with
no dissenting votes. In part the Uni-
versity Council statement read:

“The University Council respect-
fully recommends to the faculty that
the current procedure of independent
exam scheduling be continued for
the next academic year.

“Further, it is the Council's belief
that independent exams are highly
beneficial to the educational process
by placing a greater responsibility
on the individual student for the
substantive success or failure of his
academic career. It is now the stu-
dent’s burden to determine his indi-
vidual goals and study needs and to
respond accordingly.

“It is our view that no schedule can
guarantee complete security of the
subject matter of examinations. It is
also clear that the current examina-
tion schedule gives the chance for
more information to be disseminat-

ed, whether inadvertently or not.
Nevertheless, we believe that the

student body has displayed respon-
sibility thus far and consider this as
sufficient evidence that the value of
the independent exam procedure, as
an educational tool, is not signifi-
cantly impaired.”

Immediately after this vote, Bob
Carrere introduced the subject of
dorm parietals, He said, “I under-
stand the dorm councilors will pre-
sem recommendation to the SAC.
I think we should at least discuss it.”

It was decided that discussion
would be postponed until the matter
is studied by the SAC.

Law student Charlie Hofheimer
brought up the issue of proxy fights
involving stocks owned by W&L. He
recommended that a method be es-
tablished by which anyone concern-
ed over proxy fights can approach
the Board of Trustees Finance Com-
mittee.

Dean Atwood explained the cur-
rent status of ROTC courses. ROTC
courses are now open to audit under
the same conditions as any other
course. These conditions include the
permission of the instructor. Also a
non-ROTC student may take the
courses for credit if the necessary
prerequisites are fulfilled.
