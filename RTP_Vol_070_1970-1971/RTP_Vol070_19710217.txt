Convention Adjourns;

Delegates Recommend | fe

Honor Court, Senate

A Student Senate and Honor
Court, which would replace the cur-
rent Executive Committee, have
been endorsed by the Constitutional
Convention held this last weekend.

The two proposed student bodies
would split the duties now held by
the EC. The Senate would be larger
in number than the Honor Court
and perform the legislative and ad-
ministrative roles of the EC. Sole
jurisdiction over the Honor System
falls in the hands of the proposed
Honor Court.

The great majority of the existing
Student Body Constituition remained
unchanged. Only wording changes
were recommended for several
articles of the Constitution. The
foremost changes involved Articles
IV-VIH, which dealt with student
government,

Under the amended Constitution
the Honor Court would have 12
members. The three Student Body
Officers, and nine justices elected
from respective classes make up this
total. The scheme of membership
closely parallels the current selection
policy of the EC.

According to the amended Consti-
tution, the Honor Court would “have
sole jurisdiction in the implimenta-
tion of the Honor System.” The
court would also superintend all Stu-
dent Body Elections and act as the
interpretting body for the Consti-
‘tution.

The Student Senate would handle
most of the student government
activities now undertaken by the EC.
The Senate would consist of 33
members; the Student Body Officers

Jazz Group
To Perform
Tomorrow

The third concert of the
bridge Concert-Theater Series will
present the Preservation Hall Jazz
Band on Thursday, February 18 in
Jackson Memorial Hall, VMI. The
concert will begin at 8:15 p.m.

Preservation Hall, in the French
Quarter of New Orleans, is the home
of the old jazz musicians whose
vital folk art is now seldom heard.

The band that will play in Lex
ington is known as the Billie and
Dede Pierce Band, named after the
two chief musicians, Billie Pierce
on piano and her husband, Dede, on
trumpet. Other musicians of | this
group are trombonist Jim Robinson,
clarinetist William Humphrey, and
Cie Frazer on the drums. These
performers are elderly, all at least
60 years old, bul many press notices
comment on the infectious spirit of
their enthusiasm, As Newsweek com
menteod on a Philharmonic Hall
concert last summer, the music is
“nrystically sweet, pure.”

would serve on this group as well
as the Honor Court. The reamain-
ing Senators would be elected from
their classes,

All legislative powers pertaining
to the Student Body would originate
in this body. The Senate would also
have responsibility for the Standing
Committees. All appointments to
special and University Committees
would require the approval of the
Senate.

The Senate and Honor Court
would be separate entities because
of a requirement for separate mem-
bership. However, the organizations
would have contact through the
Presidem, Vice-President, and Secre-
tary of the Student Body, who are
in both organizations.

Election procedures were asked to
be altered so that the Honor Court
members would be selected two
weeks before the Senate. It was
felt by the Convention that this
would place better justices on the
Court.

The University Council would be
included in the Constitution. Its

EC A

The Executive Committee Mon-
day evening unanimously endorsed
the proposed Student Body Constitu-
tion drawn up in convention last
week. The document must now face
a student referendum and a ma-
jority of the student body must vote
for its final approval.

In other action the EC relieved
somewhat their previous ban on
editorial comment to be published
in the University Center newsletter.
Signed articles will now be encourag-
ed to allow students a forum for a
“wider range” of opinion.

Phe members of the EC, who
served as ex officio delegates to the
convention, made only a few minor
changes in the new constitution’s
text, mainly for purposes of clari-
fication.

The EC rejected an amendment
concerning contrals over the Dance
Board, reasoning that further juris-
diction over the Board would be
unfair. It was anticipated that sub-
stamtial funding for concerts from
the university in the coming year
would be highly unlikely.

They also struck a provision for
the recall of officeholders, requir
ing only two-thirds of those voting
in the student body to remove an
officer. They opted instead for a
recall procedure that would compel
the signature of $0 percent of an
officer's constituency for removal

Several members of the EC ex
pressed reservations about the new
governmental framework, fearing
that inefliciency would result from

an expansion to a larger Senate and
Honor Court. “I think we have a
real possibility of a large and un
wieldy Senate, .. . as a product of
student indifference and apathy,” re-
marked Law representative John
Moore.

Staman Ogilvie contested Moore's
view, saying that the new structure
was a necessary “calculated gamble.”
“The best that can happen,” Ogilvie
continued, “is that with this many
representatives the students will feel
that their participation might have
some real influence.... There is a
better chance that they will know
someone personally.”

President Fran Lawrence, an ad
vocate of the change, emphasized
that the function of the honor system
would not be jeopardized. “The
Honor Court will most likely con-
sists of students much like

“There will probably be less cama-

Recruiters Hard At Work

While the number of applications
at private schools is decreasing at
many area institutions, the number
of applicants to Washington and Lee
is Staying relatively stable. One rea-
son for this is the efforts of the
Student Recruitment Committee.
Phe group, headed by Steve Robin
son, has been making widespread
efforts to help the Office of Admis-
SOTK,

In the early pari of the year, mem-
bers of the organization sent letters

tempt to increase the amount of
scholarship money available. Also,
about fifty high schools have been
visited by representatives of the Siu-

On Circle K

By JOHN McCARDELL

Tonight is the deadline for sub-
mitting applications for membership
in the W&L Circle K club. Circle
K is the college division of Kiwanis
International, which also supervises
high school Key Clubs as well as
community Kiwanis clubs. I am very
grateful to the staff of the Phi for
the use of this space this week to
relate some of the activities of Circle
K on campus, and I hope that some
last-minute applications will be in-
spired. This is certainly a better
place to have one’s name found
than in some page-filled campus
gossip column, amusing though it
may be.

But we digress,

By its very nature, Circle K is
service-oriemed, toward the W&L
community, certainly, but in the
wider sense, to the entire Lexington
community as well. Working to-
gether with the Lexington Kiwanis
Club, Circle K undertakes several
community service projects each
year, which, in addition to the self-
satisfaction of working for a worth-
while and recognizable cause, fosters
better relations between students and

local business and civic leaders.
Based on the motto “We Build,”

Circle K has been active over the
last few years.

So, to enlighten those who have
heretofore been ignorant of our
work, as well as, I hope, to obtain
several last-minute application from
imterested students, a brief deserip-
tion of some of our activities might
at this time be in order.

First, with the non-existence of
any group, at least on an organized
basis, to work with the admissions
office in giving campus tours to
prospective freshmen, each member
of Circle K gave about an hour of
his time per week first term to fill
this need, and we have resumed this
serv ce for the second term as well.
A small, unnoticed service, perhaps,
but a constructive one. Over spring
vacation, as in past years, club mem-
bers will be expected to search out
qualified high school students in
their areas to encourage those who
have already been accepted to come,
and those who are at all interested
to apply.

Second, prior to first term exams
before Christmas, Circle K sponsor-
ed a raffle for the benefit of the

A Student Senate,

An Honor Council,
A Few Reasons Why

Now that the work of the Constitutional Convention is
over, and that work has received the Executive Committee
approval which, for reasons listed below, was pretty much
taken as a fait accompli, perhaps it is time to present to the
members of the student body here at Washington and Lee a
few reasons behind the actions taken at the convention, as
well as the reasons for a few omissions.

To begin, one might ask why the current Constitution had
to be changed at all. The answer to this question comes easily
to mind, and has to do with the self-evident power elite which
currently exist at the helm of student government.

That there is such an elite should be clear, that the exist-
ence of this elite tends to discourage people from seeking
positions in the government is perhaps more tenuous, but a
look at the several unopposed offices in last year’s EC elections
should serve to make this point a little more definite.

The thought of the convention was that, if more offices
were available, more candidates would be found willing to
present themselves to the electorate, since their chances of
winning have been increased considerably, simply by virtue
of the larger number of positions to be filled.

In line with this idea is the fact that Washington and Lee
is scarcely the relatively homogeneous body it was five or ten
years ago, and now there is a need to provide representation
for numerous constituencies to be found throughout the school.

The Student Senate, it is hoped, will provide that in-
creased representation. Certainly, this is how the Senate can
be utilized; it is up to us to make sure that this becomes
the case.

That it was thought necessary to separate the legislative
and judicial functions of the student government should
come as no suprprise to those of us who remember the cavilling
which greets each EC election, and the very real objections
raised against so much power placed in the hands of so few.

A good amount of care was expended on these new changes
in the Constitution, A greater amount will be necessary to
insure their success. What was hammered out with no little
attention to detail and the possible results of these actions
can quite easily die a horrible, wriggling death if met with
indifference or hostitlity. The student body has been given
the opportunity for representation and a voice in our govern-

axiomatic that we should make the best use of it.

A Few Comments On The EC
And On Constitutional Changes

\ttention Executive Committee members:

you missed a good Constitutional Convention!

Yes, after going through great efforts to insure their ap-
pointments to the Constitutional Convention, the majority of
the EC members, our elected Student Body leaders, went
through equally great efforts to stay away,

Perhaps, their rationale for leading in absentia was they
were unable to dominate the Convention, Or perhaps they
simply did not care. Neither seems to be a satisfactory ex-
planation.

One exasperated delegate commented, “I don't think half
the EC has shown up for this Convention. The leaders have
failed to lead.”

Discussion during the Constitutional Convention.

Stewart Discusses ‘Themes,
Moods As Reflected In Music

By DOUG BURTON

As a kid growing up on the out-
skirts of Chicago’s west side, com-
poser Robert Stewart learned to play
the violin at a time when violin
cases were more commonly present
at the performances of the Capone
mob. The ice cream store across
from his house was a gambling
front, and a neighbor's driveway was
even the site of a gangland execu-
tion. The kids grew up straight
though; at sixteen he got fifty cents
for playing “Blue Moon” and “So-
phisticated Lady” at a playground
dance and has been making the
violin pay ever since. His most re-
cent work, “String Quartets No, 3,”
performed by the lowa Quartet, is
latest testament to a long creative
effort.

Now head of the Music and
Drama department at Washington
and Lee, Mr. Stewart is a recipient
of several “Glenn Grants in Aid,”
a MacDowell Fellowship and “The
Best Composition Award” in 1966.
He has served on judging panels
for composition awards for “Student
Composition Awards” of BMI,
Southeastern Composers League and
others.

About his “String Quartet No. 3,”
Mr. Stewart writes: “The construc-
tion is based on two hexachords of
a 12 tone row. The first hexacord
contains a perfect Sth, a minor 2nd
and a minor 7th. The second hexa-
chord contains major and minor
2nds, perfect 4ths and augmented
Sths. The omission of 3rds and 6ths
in the row lends a biting and tense

character to the melodic structures
which evolve from the permutation
of intervals in each hexachord.”

The lowa Quartet, called “one of
the best in the world,” by Atlantic
Monthly, has a distinguished inter-
national reputation for its interpreta-
tion of classical chamber music as
will as the music of contenyporary
composers. Attestation to their
prestige is the fact that they play
a set of Stradivarius instruments
once owned by Paganini, on loan
from Washington's Corcoran Gal-
lery.

Stewart composes music as: “a
reflection of man’s culture in the
ethno-musicological sense. While
each composition is a ‘new’ one, the
style is somewhat predetermined by
current existing experiences which
may not be necessarily musical
ones, but which nevertheless estab-
lish the ‘rules of order’ for the work
during its compositional phase. Thus
no particular ‘ism’ controls the
creative process.”

Mr. Stewart is widely known as
a composer and his compositions
have been performed by some of the
leading groups of the United States:
Composers Forum-NYC, Music in
Our Time-NYC, Atlanta Symphony
Orchestra, Roanoke Symphony Or-
chestra, Virginia State Symphony,
and the Albony Symphony Orches-
tra.

The quartet is dedicated to his
wife and was first performed by the
lowa String Quartet at the Uni-
versity of lowa in the fall of 1959.

Prognosis Seen

By DAVID OLSON

Whether you know it or not
there was a Constitutional conven-
tion, of all things, this past week-
end. I'm sure many of us greeted
this event with a bewildered “what
for?” because it seemed to come out
of the woodwork. But if we search
into our memories we will find that
only last spring there was. some
serious talk about reforming the
governmental set-up of the jurisdic-
tion of the Student Body. What
came out of this weekend's delibera-
tions was a sensible and forward-
looking document.

While it is not revolutionary it
certainly is a big step in the direc-
t.on of sensible and participatory
government. Under the proposed
changes the old Executive Commit-
tee will be replaced by two bodies
that will fulfill its present functions.
A twelve-man Honor Council has
been proposed to handle all matters
concerned with the Honor Sysien
and to handle elections and to fill
vacancies that may appear. The
legislative functions of the Execu-
tive Committee will be handled by
a thirty-member Student Senate.
Under the proposed changes the
president, vice-president and secre-
tary will serve with the Honor Coun-
cil and the Senate.

The new set-up will definitely re-
lieve some of the burden presenily
on the Executive Committee. It will
enable more people to take a role in
Siudent government and will lessen
the load on each of the represen‘a-
tives. Not only will more people
become involved but it might be that
more people will want to become
involved in the government when

As Favorable

they realize that their duties will be
in a specific area and that it will
not be as time consuming as it has
been in the past to serve one’s fellow
students,

The separation of powers pro-
posed in the new Constitution is the
most important reform. To have one
deliberative body ruling on legisla-
tive and honorial questions is not
only too much to ask but it is also
dangerous. Unknown to us there
may at one honor trial have been
a decidedly (political consideration
that came before the E.C., in the
course of the Honor trial. This is
not meant to be a slight at the
integrity of the members of any
E.C, but it could happen and if it
did the student in question would
be in very hot water. What I am
saying is that while the proposed
Honor Council is not political (as
it should be) it comes closer to that
point than does the present E.C.
Chis is a definite invyprovement and
a much desired and needed one.

One can only at this point urge
that this new Constitution receive
the support of the student body.
It deserves that support and it also
deserves our patience and our open-
mindedness. Some delegates com-
plained that certain members of the
E.C. were missing during the final
sessions of the convention. Hope-
fully this new Constitution will alevi-
ate the beleagured feeling of the
members of the student government.
President Fran Lawrence must be
congratulated on his job this week-
end. It will most surely go down as
a thankless job but it was his brain-
child and deserves our thanks for
his diligence and hard work.

We are the heirs of a firee heritage,
yet we are as well the children of
autocracy, Our ancestors sought
America as a sanctuary and made
it a land of opportunity which—for
all its inequalities and faults—pro-
vided more benefits to a greater
share of its citizens than any other
nation has ever done. This ‘became
a nation of individual liberties, most
noted for recognizing as rights per-
sonal freedoms never before en-
joyed by any populace. We were the
“New Order of the Ages,” we were

the dream has gone wrong: some-
where in this century Horatio Alger
died and Lo! rose again in the guise
of Babbitt.

And now the grandchildren of
those who forged this nation with
the dual bonds of patriotism and
freedom are enslaved by the ever-
growing dynamism of the state.
That dedication to the freedoms of
all men has become a mockery in
the relentless and mutual leaching
of our indivdual liberties by the ar-
rogant bureacracy and grasping poli-
ticians of our government. We have
little enough of our heritage left to
us in this era of the Space Age:
the pride we feel in our nation’s
having placed men on the moon is
but a ‘bittersweet crumb which can
hardly placate for the loss of our
once-precious and inalienable free-
doms.

of history that the American people

the revolutionary nihilism of the

Being only one of seven girls on
the Washington and Lee University
campus of 1,527 boys, could, I sup-
pose, be an exciting experience. It
could mean an endless round of
dates, never having to open a door
myself, and being the center of at-
tention.

It could be—but it isn't. I can’t
really say that I am disappointed,
though.

I came to W&L as a student, to
take journalism courses that I could
not get at Hollins. But many of the
professors and my fellow students
treated me as as though I was study-
ing for the proverbial “M.R.S.” de-
gree. Or they thought that I was a
subversive Women's Liberation
agent sent to break down the bar-
riers of male chauvinism. Or they
ignored me. At any rate, few took
seriously the fact that I bought
textbooks; and the idea that I could
be a student, too, well—it crossed
precious few minds.

The first weeks in class were just
as hard as the hours out of class.
Professors felt noticeably inhibited

how we could possibly comprehend
the study material. I had one pro-

“Miss Ennies, do you understand

I learned the quickest way to stop

With Malice Toward Some
An Alternate Solution?

By JEFFREY B. SPENCE

Last week’s issue of this news-
paper printed the ‘basic consensus
Opinions that could be gleaned from
the Honor System poll of earlier
this year. One of these opinions
shows an apparent change in the
thinking of our student body, This
change concerns the ultimate pen-
alty.

Since the inception of the Honor
System, here at W&L, there have
continued to be three major elements
of it that have remained unchanged.
These elements are: student control
and regulation of the system, each
case being tried as a unique and
individual situation based on its on
merit, and the single penalty of
expulsion upon conviction.

Now it appears that the mood of
the student body is changing. The
poll taken by the Executive Com-
mittee has shown that an alternative
penalty of one year’s suspension
could be added. If this were done,
then what would happen to the
Honor System?

Well, we would probably bring
renewed life to a dying institution.
The Honor System is in trouble.
It is in trouble because the part
that says we shall not tolerate honor
violators no longer is holding up.
The reason why is simply that stu-
dents today think twice before they
will turn a fellow student in for a
supposed honor offense.

If a student sees what he thinks
is a potential violation he is more
inclined to pass judgment on it by
himself first, before he turns the
case over to the E.C. Quite simply,
because he realizes that not all acts
by his fellow students can be judged
equally immoral.

   

If stuednts were to increasingly
refrain from turning in alleged viola-
tions, within the next five years the
Honor System would probably be
dead. It appears as if the ultimate
penalty may be the cause of the
second-thoughts that students have
when confronted with an honor
offense situation. If this is the case,
then we must institute a lesser pen-
alty to stand alongside the ultimate
penalty.

One would believe that most stu-
dents here at W&L see things in
gradations as opposed to pure black
and white, In fact, isn’t that what
a liberal education is all about?
Little children see things as all good
or all bad, but the sign of an
adult is one who can perceive the
massive gray area of life that lies
between black and white. To func-
tion successfully in today’s complex
society, it is necessary that we
realize that very little may be con-
sidered fixed or absolute.

There seems to be no reason why
this line of thought must be deleted
from our system of behavioral self-
regulation. It is foolish to consider
every honor offense as equal in
gravity with every other one. Cer-
tainly blatant honor violations de-
serve the ultimate penalty, but is
there not a difference between a man
who cheats out of greed and a man
who cheats under pressure or oul
of sheer panic?

I certainly think there is a dif-
ference. | hope that when the new
Honor Council convenes that they
will take into consideration the
changing mood of the W&L student
body. There is nothing wrong with
having a humane Honor System.

Frank Brooks: From The Bird’s Nes

HoJo Bowl To Be Played

Few of you have heard but there are two football games
this spring that have special importance here at W&L. While
the football team prepares for its Feb. 27 match with the
alumni, another group is getting ready for what they consider
far more important competition. On the Sunday of Hollins
Cotillion, W&L will take on the UNC team in the final bowl
for the season: the Second Annual HoJo Bowl.

The HoJo Bowl had spontaneous beginnings. At the Satur-
day night dance last year the typical goading between schools
resulted in a challenge to a touch football game to be played
Sunday afternoon at the Upper Field of Howard Johnson's
on Williamson Road. As participants and spectators arrived,
the beer was passed out, and before long, the players were

 

warmed up.

The fans cheered wildly as W&L kicked to UNC. The
first set of downs resulted in a punt which Tommy Boman
fielded. Three plays later, W&L had failed to gain and were
forced to punt. Fortunately, there was a unanimous decision
to call that the end of the first half.

As in all bowl half-times, the HoJo Bowl had its festive
ceremonies. The cheerleaders did a dance while the UNC
team built a ragged pyramid. Then the Queen was chosen. His
name was Hacker Caldwell, and he fell off the float twice
which was truly magnificant.

It took a while for the second half to get started, but
when it finally did, the competition became intense. UNC
somehow received again but they were held. W&L failed to
move on the next set of downs. Then UNC snuck a receiver
deep and completed a bomb for the touchdown. All agreed
that the clock ran out, and the W&L gridders hung their
heads mumbling something about next year.

Thus the HoJo Bowl stands 1-0 for UNC, but W&L plans
a strong comeback this year. Your support is needed.

By the way, word's out that Luke has a new coo while
Country Club keeps batting his baby blues at his new honey

Steve Fluharty will lead the Generals against the Alumni on Feb, 27.

Spring Practice Begins

Coach Buck Leslie began Spring
practice this past Friday with great
weather. Leslie hopes the good
weather holds up long enough for
him to find a running attack to
complement his passing game, which
last fall boasted the nation’s no, 7
college division passer, Steve Flu-
harty.

Fluharty, a rising junior from
Si. Petersburg, Fla., heads the roster
of 70 candidates who put on the
pads Friday. The big question is,
who will catch his passes?

Gone through graduation are re-
ceivers Steve Mahaffey, Bruce Green
and Frank Stearns. Mahaffey was
the top receiver in the country last
fall with 74, an average of over
eight a game.

But there are some quick-handed
youngsters waiting in the wings,
most notably junior Chappy Conrad
of Richmond and soph speedster
Rich Romanelli of Aberdeen, Md.

A bevy of sophomores are bent on
earning starting roles in the offensive

backfield. Five of them, Russ Hewitt,
Mike Brittin (of Great Falls), John
Loesing, Johnny Sheridan (of Lex-
ington) and Bill Wallace (of Roa-
noke) all possess the speed which has
been notably lacking in the Generals’
recent running game. Veteran run-
ning back JoJo Martin, a co-captain,
returns.

Leslie must also shore up the
offensive line which lost Staman
Ogilvie and Steve Hannon to gradua-
tion. Lexington’s 230-pound Johnny
Sorrells is expected to help here.

The defense appears fairly well
set with the return of senior co-
captain Dave Brooks and safety
Marshall Washburn (of Lexington)

“We lost some good boys to
graduation,” noted Leslie, “but there
are a lot of youngsters just waiting
for their chance. The prospects look
good.”

The Generals will work out,
weather permitting, for two weeks,
climaxed by an alumni varsity game
on Saturday, Feb. 27.

The icy sidewalks are doubly
treacherous; if one falls, one might
not only crack a skull, but also bleed
to death as a result of that gravel.
The infirmary is packed with stu-
dents, as Vitamin C is being flown
in from Florida. There has been a

ed only by the financial panic of
1893. Yes, the cold season is opon
us. But what is that noise in the
gym?

It may still be basketball season,
but for Coach Joe Lyles and dozens
of others, it’s time to loosen rusty
arms, to shanpen dull batting eyes,
and to prepare for the 1971 baseball
season. Actually, some have ‘been
silently at work for some weeks
now, either on their own or in
pairs. The first organizational meet-
ings have already ‘been held. Right
now, the workouts are scheduled
around basketball practice.

Generally, the pitchers and catch-
ers work out two hours, followed by
the infielders and outfielders for two
hours. The next workout is set for
Thursday and all those interested
who have for some reason made
themselves unavailable are welcome
to try out.

Meanwhile, the grunts and groans
from over Wilson Field way tell us
that the annual ritual of spring foot-
ball, one of Washington and Lee’s
supreme tess is underway. Late last
week, the remnants of last season's
squad, sprinkled with the inevitable
number of new faces, drew equip-

Lynchburg And Loyola Top W&L

By PALMER TRICE

“I'd like to fonget last week.”
This comment was made by Wash-
ington and Lee coach Verne Can-
field, and, if anything stands as
an understatement. The Generals
lost to two different kinds of species,
Greyhounds and Hornets. The Blue
just had a bad streak of ‘hunting,
as they could not get any fowls to
drop.

On Tuesday, the W&L hoopers
went Over the mountains to the not
so friendly confines of Lynchburg
College. The Hornets won by a
90-74 margin, in spite of the fact
that both teams made the same
number of shots from the field. The
Generals, usually a relatively foul-

free team, had 49 foul shots taken
by their opponents. The team had
expected to find the home squad to
be out for revenge, but not the refs?

Aside from not playing well
enough to win, Lynchburg proved to
be a disaster. The Generals had 25
turnovers, and failed to get many
second and third shots. The squad
shot a poor 38 percent from the
field, and only 54 percent from the
foul line. In their losing effort, W&L
was led by Mike Daniel, who had
18 points and 10 rebounds. Skip
Lichtfuss and Paul McClure both
contributed 12 points apiece. “We'll
look forward to the encounter with
Lynchburg next year.”

The fans could not have asked

«>

 

for a closer ball game than that
that was played Friday night. Loyola
College, in Baltimore, brought an
impressive 13-4 record to Doremus.
Two of the losses included games

with Maryland and St. Bonaventure.

The home ball club opened up a
quick 8-1 lead, but the Greyhounds
used a 22-6 run to open up a 23-14
lead. Led ‘by Dave Stone and John
Glace, the Generals batled back to
trail by a 35-31 margin at the half.

In the second half, Loyola came
out in a full court zone press. It had
little effect on the Blue, as they
stormed back on three quick ‘baskets
by Skip Lichtfuss. John Glace put
‘he Generals in front at 43-42. For
several minutes, the lead changed

The 1970-71 Washington and Lee Varsity Basketball Team

W restling Team Tastes Victory

After a series of demoralizing de-
feats, the W&L grapplers made a
dazzling comeback to defeat a strong
Hampden-Sydney team.

Down 10 points at the beginning
of the match, due to the sickness
of two regular starters, the Generals
had ¢o win all but one match.

Pat Buford lost a close decision
in the first match of the evening
the Generals could not afford
another loss if they hoped to re-
main in contention. W&L’s tough
middle weigit division, conyposed of
Wade Gowe, Bill Milton, Bill West,

Jim Stieff, and Charlie Ross, all
pulling weight, defeated tough op-
ponents. Jim Stieff soundly beat his
opponent, despite a bloody nose
which stopped the match several
times.

With the score 15-13, a pin by

Dee Copenhaver would have put the
lid on the victory. In fact, it looked
like he would have to get a pin,
because the Hampden-Sydney heavy
weight looked as mean as a pro
fessional wrestler. He weighed about
230 and had intimidated everyone
by glowering through his head gear
during the entire match. Copenhaver
succeeded in dominating his op
ponent but could not seem to be

able to pin him.

In a desperate attempt in the last
minute of the match, Copenhaver
put a precarious cradle on his op-
ponent. It nearly destroyed the hope
of victory, however, as he lost his
balance and was nearly pinned. De-
spite this he managed to win the
decision by virtue of riding time.

Phen with the score, 18-13, Forrest
Hampton just needed to avoid being
pinned to capture the victory. The
Hampden-Sydney heavyweight pro-
ceeded to violently muscle Hampton
around the mat to the ecstatic cheer-
ing of the white socked, red-neck
local fans. Hampton narrowly avoid-
ed pins several times, however, dur-
ing this time his opponent had lock-
ed his hand illegally four times and
was expelled from the match in the
third period. The final score was
23-13. Coaches Cohen and Skinner
were finally able to enjoy the victory

hands, the home club getting several
key baskets from Captain Mike
Daniel. With 4:14 remaining, and
the Blue in front by a 56-55 score,
the Generals called a time out. Skip
Lichtfuss replaced John Glace. After
play had resumed, Skip ‘hit a quick
basket, to lengthen the lead to three.
In the last three minutes, the Gen-
erals held their slim lead, maintain-
ing a stall. The Greyhounds were
forced to foul the home club, who
was in a bonus 1-1 situation. How-
ever, the lid was on the basket, and
nothing would drop. The visitors
took the lead with 24 seconds left,
and Coach Canfield called time out.
The Generals lost the ball and then
stole it ‘back with only six seconds
remaining. Paul McClure took a
last second shot that fell just short.
It was a disappointing loss, especi-
ally as the team played well enough
to win,

Tuesday, the Generals met
Bridgewater away. This should prove
a battle, as W&L is the big game
on the Bridgewater schedule. They
will be out for revenge. After
Bridgewater, the team from Dickin-
son College of Carlisle, Pennsyl-
vania will visit Doremus. Next Satur-
day, the Blue will travel to Fairleig’-
Dickinson, a major college that is
ranked about third in the nation in
defense. If you will pardon the
cliche, the Generals will have their
work cut out from them. A recent
bulletin finds that Washington and
Lee has been seeded number one in
teh CAC tournament. The success of
past years, plus this year’s relative
success has put the burden of the
favorite on our shoulders. Will we
live up to it?

Kumpuris: New
All-American

Washington and Lee University’s
1970 football co-captain, Drew
Kumpuris, has been named to the
second team Academic All-America
squad.

Kumpuris, a senior from Little
Rock, Ark., lettered for three years
at his linebacker position, but was
unable to play his senior year due
to a pre-season knee injury. In the
three years he played, he was con-
sistently one of the leading tacklers.

The college division Academic
All-America squad was selected by
the voting membership of the Col-
lege Sports Information Directors of
America, and conducted by Ted
Emery of the Gator Bowl Associa-
tion. To qualify, a player must have
a ‘B’ average or better for the past
year or cumulative for his college
career.

EC Discusses

Constitution,
Student News

(Continued from Page 1)

The Constitution was finally ap-
proved, with Moore dispatching a
few reservations concerning the
Honor System, “in order to get this
before the student body.”

In an appearance before the EC
earlier in the meeting, freshman
Jed Yonge asked the committee to
rescind its previous decision restrict-
ing the University Center newsletter
to a “schedule of events” format.
He suggested that he be able to
write editorials for the publication,
“so that I can express my opinion
and possibly let other students to
do so.”

Yonge maintained that blacks and
other campus groups are offered no
outlet for their viewpoints, and he
acoused The Ring-tum Phi of being
“incredibly ‘biased and  narrow-
minded,”

Lawrence questioned the right of
the EC to subsidize a competitive
campus publication, saying that the
purpose of the university center was
essentially “to keep this building and
ts activities running.” John Moore,
suggesting that a second newspaper
might be desirable, said that “it
should not be done in this way.”

The EC ultimately approved a
resolution permitting Yonge and
others to submit signed articles to
the newsletter, to be printed at the
discretions of its editors.

In further business, Tompkins and
Thompson reported that the Trea-
surer of the university is considering
the prospect of including the “Con-
tact” assessment within the Student
Activities Fee and raising the alloca-
tion to The Ring-tum Phi to allow
possibly for publication of three
pssues every two weeks.

Lawrence also announced that a
new procedure is being initiated for
the organization of athletic clubs
on campus, All such groups must
(a) not involve one of the university's
intercollegiate sports, (b) must have
a faculty advisor, (c) must be ap-
proved through the Assistant Di-
rector of Athletics.

things that required jeans rather
than a dress, so I returned to my

traditional Hollins costume of jeans,

shirt, and tennis shoes. It probably
seems silly to everyone else, but |
believe that when I stopped wearing
dresses all the time and began wear-
ing those old jeans, 1 was accepted
for myself. The guys were much
more ready to treat me as an equal
when they saw that I wasn’t flaunt-
ing clothes or wearing short skints.
And jeans and tennis shoes cer-
tainly lend more to a student image
around here.

Jeans and tennis shoes or not, the
atmosphere changed. The bod inci-
dents became fewer and fewer. |
settled dow nand became rather con-
tent with W&L.

Here I am, well into the second
term with a few observations on this
whole thing. First: the Eight Col-
lege Exchange Program is a work-
able alternative for this school to
coeduction and/or drastic expansion
of the facihities. It should be utilized
to the hilt.

Second: for the first run I suppose
the Exchange Program is working
OK. But W&L really was not psy-
chologically (prepared for women
students—even just seven of them.
For women have traditionally been
weekend creatures in Lexington and
1 suppose many guys have nearly
forgotten that we exist Monday
through Friday, too.

Third: it takes a particular kind
of girl who wil lallow herself to be
put in this situation, It takes a
little of the trailblazed spirit. Every-
thing she does is a “first” and no-
body but nobody wil let her forget
it.

Fourth: it has been well worth the
trauma. To say that it has been an
experience that I shall never forget
just could be the understatement of
the semester.

Constitutional
Convention

Comes to Close

members would be selected by the
Senate. Candidates for selection must
submit petitions of 150 names to
be eligible for consideration.

A total of 32 delegates attended
the Convention, which was held in
Evans Dining Hall. Four sessions of
debate and discussion resulted in
about 14 hours of work.

Late Sunday the Convention rec-
ommended the amended Constitu-
tion to the EC for its weekly meet-
ing. If the EC endorses the Consti-
tution drafted by the Convention, a
Student Body referendum would be
needed to change the existing Consti-
tution. If the BC does not approve
this Constitution, a two-third ma-
jority of the students may enact
the Constitution.

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Verne Edwards, in his book
“Journalism in a Free Society,”
states that editorials should, if any-
thing, be more thoroughly factual
and researched than a nonmal news
story. As in the past, the RTP has
thrown this guideline out the win-
dow,

Your editorial concerning Charles
M. Gunn’s bill in the current House
of Delegates was inflammatory,
spoken in broad generalities, and
evidently poorly researched.

The bill will make it possible for
the University to be taxed. An ex-
planation is necessary, however. The
only taxable items will be univer-
sity owned residences. That is, the
few homes W&L maintains, and the
extensive faculty housing maintain-
ed by VMI. The same with other
institutions in the state.

A residence tax could be billed
to the university. It would have to
ibe, according to the provisions of
the new state constitution. Any
school administrator would pass this
tax on to the individual occupant,
however.

WAL is already billed collectively
for utility services. The charges are
then sent to the individuals. The
residence tax would be the same,
passing no further costs to the uni-
versity.

Obviously state educators who re-
ceive the benefits of low-cost camipus
housing are up in arms. An in-
teresting point arises, however. Aip-
proximately 90 percent of residence

taxes are devoted to public educa-
tion, which all college faculty mem-
bens should champion.

Yet here in Lexington, members
of W&L and VMI faculties who
take advantage of the on-campus
housing are paying no taxes toward
public education through residence
taxes. Many faculty members do
take advantage of the public school
system. Therefore, people earning
twice to three times the median in-
comes of Lexington residents are not
paying a representative amount to-
ward education.

As Mr. Gunn says, “The bill only
strives at equalization.” A law gradu-
ate of W&L, Gunn has presented a
very just bill, with no intention of
further gouging the university com-
munity. More obvious and blatant
moves by the city deserve attention,
ie. parking meters, license tags.

While my statements may be in-
terpreted as unsound by the editorial
staff, I ask you to at least talk
to Mr. Gunn before making any
more blanket statements in regard
to the issue. Max Brantley

Along with the continuation of
