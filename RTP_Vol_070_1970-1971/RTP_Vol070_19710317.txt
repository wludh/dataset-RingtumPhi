IN JOINT

On Involvement

BY STEVE ROBINSON
President-elect of the Student Body

Washington and Lee has experi-
enced many changes in the two and
a half years I have been here, but
student government has remained
fairly static until just recently. The
formation of the University Council
has, for the first time, given the stu-
dents of W&L real power in the
University government. However,
to make full use of this opportunity,
the potential of the U.C, must be un-
derstood, and some of the ideas and
habits of the students must change.

In previous years, many student
ideas of liberalization of various
University policies regarding student
life were suggested. They would be
brought before the E.C., and many
times, were approved by this group.
rhe suggestion went on to the fac-
ulty, and many times was rejected,
and here the proposal died. With the
formation of the University Council,
the faculty will be bypassed in mat-
ters concerning student affairs.

Yet this group of men should not
just become a place where students
can get resolutions passed, such as
liberalization of parietals, that the
entire faculty would not endorse. In-
stead this body can serve as an offi-
cial intermediary between students
and faculty and administration. The
Council should serve as a sounding
board for ideas brought up by stu-
dents and faculty. It is with these
duties that one must realize the im-
portance of the University Council.

Thus the elections for student
members of the University Coun-
cil, which are a week from today,
are ones of great inyportance. This
body whil be the one which, hope-
fully, will determine the direction of
the University in many matters of
current interest. This group will be
the one that can really accomplish
things of mutual benefit to students
and faculty and administration.

Another aspect of student govern-
ment that remained relatively con-
stamt is the apathy. This must not
prevail if the student government is
to reach its potential. Granted, many
people did not know what was being

Washington and Lee University’s Weekly Newspaper

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, MARCH 17, 1971

Steve Robinson Is Elected;
Calls For ‘Communication’

p.m. the results for Student Body of-
ficers were not announced until 7:00.
The delay was due to the close races
for both offices and numerable re-
counts.

Steve Robinson, a junior from
Alexandria, Va., said he thought im-
provement needed to be made in the
lines of communication between the
Executive Committee and the Stu-
dent Body. Robinson stated that “a
lot of work can be done with the
University Council (which he will
serve On in an ex officio basis), One
of the first topics that can be dis-
cussed there is drugs. Another is
parietals, With the University Coun-

EC Studies Exam Pledge;

Change Is Recommended

The Executive Committee has re-
commended a change in the pledge
on the independent examinations.
The EC called for a return to the old
pledge used on regular tests and
papers.

Law Representative Jim Slay,
moved that “the wording on the en-
velopes does not apply. Students
should write the existing pledge: ‘On
my honor as a Washington and Lee
gentleman I pledge I neither gave or
received aid on this examination.’ ”
This motion passed 9-1 with Ogilvie
dissenting.

Slay emphasized in his motion
that value judgments (such as saying
an examination was “hard") would
be subject to honor trials. Slay also
pointed out that any exam that is
turned in for a grade is assumed to
be pledged, whether it is pledged or
not,

Student Body President Fran Law-
rence explained the rationale for this
decision by the EC. “We made a
mistake in accepting the original
wording of the pledge from the fac-
ulty. This action is an attempt to re-
affirm the original pledge which we
consider sufficient.”

Phe EC also announced the candi-
dates who had submitted petitions
for class office elections, which will
be conducted next Monday with run-
offs Wednesday.

In the senior class four men are
running for president. The candi-
dates are: Bo Brookby, David Har-
bert, James MeCane and Bert Meem
From the Soience School Charlie
Pride was unopposed for vice presi-
dent. John Lawlor and Doug Madi-
son will contend for Commerce
School vice president. In the Arts

Four upcoming juniors are seek-
ing the presidency of the class of

Chuck Dunn and George Wolfe
have filed their petitions for that of-
fice. Larry Evans and Gary Polia-
koff are candidates for junior vice
president. In the election for EC rep-
resentatives are: Archer Frierson,

ter, and Robert Sherwood,

It is a three way race for the
president of the Sophomore class.
Declared candidates include: Durant

McCain. Chris Overcash was unop-
posed for vice president of the class
of °74. Russ Fletcher, Floyd Lewis,
Mike Weinstein and Steve Wood-
ruff are running for the two sopho-
more seats on the EC. A late-filing
candidate for Sophomore EC is
Mike Brittin.

Jim Slay relayed to The Ring-tum
Phi that the Law School would hold
its elections early next week. The
candidates from the Law School will
speak tonight. Up for election in the
Law School are three positions on
the University Council and two seats
on the EC.

It was announced that election
posters should not go on anything
painted white on the campus, espec-
ially columns and trim. The Build-
ings and Grounds men will tear fly-
ers that are posted on these surfaces
because they hurt the paint.

cil consisting of equal numbers of
faculty and students, it can be an ex-
cellent medium of change.”

“] think the current informality of
the EC is unrealistic,” Robinson ob-

served. “The EC must get things
done. It cannot afford to waste
time.”

Robinson added that, “I’m pretty
well aware of things going on in the
EC now. I've tried to talk with the
current members about their activi-
ties on the EC. I don't think there
will be any loss of continuity.”

Rick Gray, a sophomore from
Dallas, Texas, also admitted that he
hoped to improve the communica-
tion between the EC and the stu-
dents. “It is my biggest hope for next
year,” Gray commented. “I see three
methods of accomplishing this as
Secretary of the Student Body. First,
I can talk to The Ring-tum Phi re-
porters and be sure that all the facts
concerning the students are present-
ed fully and correctly. Second, |
‘hope to expand the publication and
distribution of the EC minutes.
Third, maybe we can start an EC
newsletter with a summary of events
before the EC.”

Gray continued his thoughts on
his new office, “I don’t think a lot of
people know how to get information
about their student government.
These people stay uninformed and
uninvolved.”

According to the Student Body
Constitution, the newly elected of-
ficers cannot take office until gradua-
tion in June. However, it is the cus-
tom of previous ECs for these newly
elected members to be invited to the
meetings remaining this year. This
custom has developed so that the
officers can get a better idea of how
the EC operates.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

March 17, 1971

Riverboat Gambling And The Dance Board

“I want to bring the Fancy Dress Ball
back to Lexington.” That quotation could
have come from a great number of W&L stu-
dents. That it came from newly elected
Fancy Dress President Brian Greig is all the
more significant, though.

Some might have thought that Mr. Greig
was only half-serious when he ran for the of-
fice last week. But his comments after the
elections last week are dead serious, But so
what?

This year’s Dance Board President Skip
Nottberg wasn’t exactly relishing the decision
to delete the affair from this year’s fare of
entertainment. The death blow to Fancy
Dress was dealt reluctantly but realistically
by the Dance Board.

Casting all sentiment aside, the problem
with THE BALL is not lack of student in-
terest, but lack of funds. To combat this un-
controllable pauperism, next year’s Dance
Board President Bert Meem has suggested
that what’s needed is a money raising cam-
paign in the spring. The Board could sell tic-
kets for $30 this spring, $35 this summer, and
$40 next year. That arithmetical progression
would make the budgeting chore all the more
realistic,

We agree with Mr, Greig and Mr, Meem.
Fancy Dress should return—perhaps with
some alterations in the format. Changes in
the program aren't the issue. What is really at
stake is the future of the Dance Board itself.

Mr. Meem’s plan to raise money looks
good on paper, but a quick glance at past sales
figures shows that it probably won't work.
The 1969-70 Dance Board under the leader-
ship of Dean Kumpuris sold 770 dance plans,
had a Fancy Dress, and left a $6,000 deficit.
The deduction could be made that somewhere
on the ledger, more dance plan money was
desperately needed. From the outset of this
year, Mr. Nottberg has had more than his
share of financial problems—the W&L re-
cord for the least number of dance plans sold
(770) was broken with only 440 takers by
September 30, 1970.

Mr. Meem may be optimistic about the
money he'll take in this spring, but we're not
—we see a fault in his logic. Students’ musical
tastes are more varied now than they ever
have been; they waited this year (as in years
past) to see what entertainers the Board
would sign before they even thought of fork-
ing out $40. What's to make them any differ-

ent this spring? Or next year?

The problem remains: how do you run a
Dance Board on little or no money? You can
gamble. And you can lose big if you sign an
entertainer that no one wants to see. The
point is, if you are running a Dance Board,
you cannot take the Brand X route. Even if
you don’t have the money, you have to sign
somebody well-known—or your dance plan
buyers will not be happy. But how can you
financially justify signing an expensive group
with no guarantee of a return from their ap-
pearance?

Our vision of a good Dance Board Presi-
dent is not a Mississippi riverboat gambler
in a white suit with a black string tie. With
the rising cost of entertainment, the Dance
Board is clearly destined for financial obli-
vion. Unless the only sound alternative is
taken: the institution of an entertainment
fee.

The fee would be collected from all stu-
dents during registration for the fall term
next year. Dance plans would not be neces-
sary then, for the Dance Board would be tak-
ing in money from all students. All that
would be required at the door would be the
W&L identification card. The Board itself
could determine how much they will need
for a workable budget and then break that
cost down to fee level itself (which would
probably be in the range of $25 to $30.)

The critics will enter at this point with ob-
jections to this psoposal on the grounds that
some students may not wish to attend all of
the concerts during a year’s time because they
didn’t like the entertainment offered, Or be-
cause they do not like to attend concerts. If
these same objections were raised to the fee
for Contact, they would be just as valid.

Not everyone is going to participate in
the Contact program even though they paid
to support it. Not everyone is excited about
attending concerts, either, The point remains
that if the caliber of concerts which came to
W&L. three or your years ago is to be upheld
in the future, students are going to pay as a
group for that quality.

The Fancy Dress Ball did not happen this
year because of money problems. If Mr.
Greig wants it to happen next year and if Mr.
Meem wants the stability of a relatively fixed
and larger budget for the Board, then they
both should push for the only means by which
their jobs can be accomplished : a fixed fee.

A Not-So-Trite Comment On Drugs

Several days ago, we received a reprint
from a recent bulletin of the Sigma Nu Fra-
ternity which we thought expressed the hu-
man tragedy of the drug abuse crisis better
than any computerized accounting of deaths
that have occured from the reckless misuse
of drugs.

Below is a letter from the dean of students
at Amherst College, Robert A. Ward, to his
students following the death of a student who
fell from the roof of a dormitory while under
the influence of LSD. The student was from
Harvard University, visiting the campus at
the time of his death.

“He was not an Amherst man; he was a
visitor. But his death occurred in our com-
munity and we shared in the loss. We were
shocked by the tragedy and stunned by the
senselessness of it. He was young and bright

too bright to surrender his life in the foolish
madness blighting a generation, In a week in
which we paused to reflect on the waste of
life half a world away, it may have been a
strange irony that we were starkly faced with
meaningless death on our campus, But that
week is nearly gone—and memory fades,

“1 will not rehearse the statements made
in the past about drugs. Many of us for some
time have been apprehensive that a tragedy
would come—and last Saturday night it did,
Repeated warnings had gone unheeded; it
couldn't happen here. | only wish those who
ignored those warnings could have spent part
of that horrible night waiting in Cooley Dick-
inson Hospital while the student's life ebbed

or part of Sunday afternoon in my office while
his parents struggled to comprehend the
reality of that day.

“I did not become dean to watch a genera-
tion of students pollute their sanity or distort
their lives, and I confess to a numbing and de-
pressing sense of helplessness. Words are in-
adequate and deeds seem fruitless, More than
ever students have taken on themselves the
individual responsibility which shapes their
lives in all areas, It should be so, but the judi-
cious exercise of such responsibility demands
wisdom, I see no wisdom at all in the growing
and indiscriminate use of drugs, I also see a
danger that one major tragedy may obscure
other tragedies, smaller perhaps but no less
frightening.

“On a beautiful Saturday afternoon which
was in itself a natural stimulant, why the
need for some artificial or uncertain drug?
And where were we all on that night or on
any night and when will we awake to the need
to replace a disinterest privatism with a sus-
tained concern for troubled people in our
community? And why do we tolerate in our
midst the profiteers of poison? And by what
moral right do we pass into the hands of
others substances which can threaten their
well-being and even their lives? What in
God's name is happening to us?

“Last Sunday in a scriptural lesson the
timeless chastisement of Thomas was repeat-
ed: ‘Because you did not see, you would not
believe,” Last Sunday we did see, Now I plead

as never before-—-please believe.”

‘Excitement’ Keynotes One-Acts

BY STEVE HAUGHNEY

Last night the Troubadour Theat-
re opened its third major production
of this season, five student-directed
one-act plays, with three Chekhov
pieces on the boards. The schedule
calls for the Chekhov plays. “The
Proposal,” “Swan Song,” and “The
Boor,” to run again tomorrow night,
March 8, and for two contempor-
ary plays, Arthur Kopit’s “Sing to
Me Through Open Windows” and
Murray Mednick’s “Sand,” to play
tonight and again on Friday night,
March 19.

For the five members of the
Troubs who are directing these
plays, this production represents an
exacting challenge. They have cho-
sen and blocked the scripts, audi-
tioned and selected the casts, and
during the past few weeks have
struggled to realize on stage their
own interpretations of the plays. All
five are accomplished actors, but the
transition from acting in a play to
directing a play is a very difficult
one.

“Sing to Me Through Open Win-
dows,” directed by Walkie May,
will be the first play under the lights
tonight. It presents the image of a
small boy visiting a remote and fan-
tastic house deep in a forest, the
home of an aging magician and his
‘butler. May has gotten fine perfor-
mances out of his actors, Richard
Pilkinton as the magician and Doug
Thomas as the butler, pacing their
dialogue to a slow and dreamy ca-
dence. This Romantic, “lost world”
atmosphere is in shanp contrast to
Greg Buch’s set, which is cluttered
with mundane objects. To me this
contrast is one of the most interest-
ing and successful features of the
play, and it is skillfully emphasized
by the lighting. This is May’s first
try at directing, and he has done an
excellent job.

The second play tonight will be
“Sand,” directed by Hugh Hill. The
mood of this piece is quite different
from the one that will precede it;
Mednick’s play is an example of
current American avant-guarde: it is
loud, brutal, and shocking. To my
mind the dialogue in the script is not
outstanding, but Hill has squeezed it
for all it's worth. He effects a count-
erpoint between the violent quarrel-
ing of the mother and the father,

The Chesapeake and Ohio Rail-
road has almost completed the pull-
ing wp of its tracks between Lex-
ington and Buena Vista. The rail-
road used to run next to the Maury
River winding along the north bank
for six miles from one community to
the other. When the flood came, cer-
tain portions of the track were made
unusuable. A bridge or two was
washed out and some of the ties
were undermined and left suspended
in mid-air, held up by the rails
alone.

What remains though is a wonder-
ful trail bed which could be used as
a hiking and a bicycling path. The
view is really beautiful. Because of
an impressive line of hills between
the path and Route 60, the path ‘s
undisturbed by any noise of automo-
biles or trucks cruising down the
highway. In short, it is an excellent
place for recreation and solitude.

The Roalroad may want to sell
this land, and the Commonwealth of
Virginia and Rockbridge County
have each expressed an interest in
purchasing it. The Chesapeake and
Ohio Railroad however does not
have to sell the land to either of
these governments. And so the Wash-
ington and Lee Ecology Club has
drawn up a petition designed to in-
fluence both the actions of Chesa-
peake and Ohio and the actions of

Guarding The License
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Thanks to Jeff Spence for his en-
hightening letter regarding the danger
the Cockpit faces of losing its A.B.-
C, License because of unauthorized
consumption of 6.4 beer, wine and
spirits. Approximately 50 or 60
places each month, in the state of
Virginia, have their license suspend.

other offenses,

huve separate licenses, this is one
reason the beer cannot be transport.
ed from one place to the other.
Dance weekends are the time when
we most frequently find students in-
dulging in their alcoholic “Goodies”
during the meal period. If the A.B.C.
man comes in and finds this, and
they DO check, that could be the
end of the license.

On February 19 last, we exercised
our license for the first time when
we set up a “bar” for the dance in
the commons. We plan to do this
again—tut not without our A.B.C
License.

played by Fanny Russell and Jim
Goodrich respectively, and the bur-
eaucratic monotone of the ambassa-
dor, played by Nick Wreden, who
arrives to inform them that their son
is missing in action. Hill has done
well with this counterpoint, but the
problem he faces is with the script
itself, which seems to me to be slight
and obvious, offering little opportun-
ity for the director's imagination.

The “Evening of Chekhov” be-
comes more delightful with each suc-
cessive play. The Chekhov fare,
which the Troubs will offer Thurs-
day night, is the best of his one act
canon: “The Proposal,” “Swan
Song,” and “The Boor,”

“The Proposal” is a “joke” in one
act, according to Chekhov. The joke
involves a hypochondriacal landown-
er who arrives at his neighbor's
home to propose to his friend’s
daughter. Unfortunately, the pro-
posal is soon forgotten as arguments
ensue over ownership of lands and
the quality of their respective dogs.

The play itself is one of Chekhov's
funniest, but the joke in director
Tommy Bear's production needs
some polishing. The Chekhov's hum-
our is keenly focused on human
situations and the human comedy of
their outcome. The problem with the
play lies primarily in its interpreta-
tion: is it a farce with two dimen-
sional characters or is it more of a
joke about humanity?

Beach Vickers as Lomov, the land-
owner who imagines all sorts of
aches and pains, lacks a human qual-
ity and depth in the interpretation of
his illness. Kirk Kirkpatrick has done
an admirable job with Choobokov,
considering that he had a week to

work a part vacated by another stu-
dent. As the father of Lomov’s in-
tended, his character has little of the
Russian ‘brashness and _ strength
which the production needs to offset
Lomov’s imagined sicknesses, The
daughter of Choobukov is played by
Karen Brammer with some good in-
terpretations of situations within the
play, but here again, the human
quality of her actions is lacking in
consistency.

“The Proposal” is not without its
comic moments, but due to a lack of
form to the production and, in my
opinion, a misinterpretation of the
play, the joke to this human relation-
ship never quite gets told.

The second offering of the evening
is “Swan Song,” a piece which Chek-
hov wrote in an hour and 10 min-
utes. The change of pace which this
show provides for the one acts is
well handled by director David
Christovich. The audience is pre-
sented with a shambled stage, scat-
tered with props and stage scenery.
Into this empty blackness walks Svet-
lovidov, an old vaudeville actor who
has overslept in the theatre after one
of his final performances. As the
actor, John Stack reviews his life
and faces the true desolation of his
existence. His performance is as be-
bievable as the mood which the set
creates.

When Lawrence Reed, a dishevel-
ed prompter, rushes to the actor's
side to give him the lines of the Fool
from “King Lear,” that moment cap-
tures the essence of the play's grasp
upon the viewer. The extraordinary
excitement of Christovich’s produc-
tion is that he has worked with his

can novelist and short story-writer,
will visit W&L for two weeks in
May under the university's Glasgow
Endowment Visiting Scholars pro-
gram.

The author of “A Long and Happy
Life,” which won the William Faulk-
ner prize in 1962 as the year’s best
first novel, Price has also written

the government if the Railroad sells
them the land. Below is the petition
in full.

“The Chesapeake and Ohio Rail-
road is currently removing its tracks
between Lexington and Buena Vista.
This land, currently occupied by the
tracks, would provide an excellent
site for public recreation such as
hiking, bicycling and camping. To
our knowledge, the Commonwealth
of Virginia and Rockbridge County
have both expressed an interest in
purchasing this land.

Therefore, we petition the Chesa-
peake and Ohio Railroad to sell this
property to the local, state or federal
government; and we also petition
that if this land is sold to a local,
state of federal government that that
government use it for the above
mentioned purposes and that mo-
torized vehicles be specifically ex-
cluded.”

The Washington and Lee Ecology
Club would very much like to see
this land used for these purposes,
and we are asking for support from
the Student Body and the Faculty.
Ali we need is your signature. The
petition is posted in the Student
Union and also on the bulletin
board outside of the Co-op. We ap-
preciate your support.

(1963), a collection of stories, “A
Generous Man” (1966), “Love and
Work” (1968), both novels, and, last
year, “Permanent Errors,” another
collection of stories.

During his two-week visit sche-
duled May 10 through 21, he will
deliver at least one public lecture
and one or two readings. Other pub-
lic appearances may be scheduled as
well, according to the Glasgow Com-
mittee, under whose sponsorship
Price will appear.

In addition, the writer will main-
tain office hours at the university for
student writers and will, when pos-
sible, read and critique their manu-
scripts,

Born in Macon County, North
Carolina, Price received his B.A. de-
gree from Duke University in 1955,
and as a Rhodes Scholar he attend-
ed Merton College, Oxford, for three
years. He returned to Duke as a
member of the English faculty in
1968, where he is now associate pro-
fessor. He has served as writer-in-
residence at the Universities of Kan-
sas and North Carolina (Chapel
Hill).

The Arthur Graham and Mar-
garet Glasgow Endowment, created
in 1960 through a bequest from Mr.
Glasgow, is designed “to promote
the art of expression by pen and
tongue.” Previous Glasgow Visiting
Scholars have included Katherine
Anne Porter, Edward Albee, James
Dickey, Robert Penn Warren and
David Stacton. Last year, the pro-
gram sponsored a week-long sym-
posium on the contemporary motion
picture, which included the world
premiere of the Columbia film
“Watermelon Man.”

Welfare, Poverty Continue
Throughout County Area

BY KURT KRUMPERMAN

There is a channel in which those
who wish to do something in the
area of poverty can do so: Virginia
VWRO. VWRO is running a state-
wide campaign aimed to recruit col-
lege students and graduates for a
year of volunteer service in the state.
There are many jobs available: 1) re-
cruiting and organizing new or grass-
roots WRO groups in rural or ur-
iban areas, 2) working on issue cam-
paigns, such as Title 1, food pro-
grams, etc., 3) fund raising, 4) form-
ing coalitions with other groups that
would help VWRO, such as labor
unions, community action groups,
etc., 5) legal aid which involves wel-

fare law research and representation
of people at fair hearings, and 6)
working with Friends of WRO, who
are non-poor people supporting the
aims and projects of WRO. VWRO
is already performing all these tasks
‘but in needs more organizers to help
the poor to form themselves into
functioning self-sufficient grouips.
This program is obviously geared
toward graduating seniors and law
school seniors. The question of the
draft will have to be handled indivi-
dually. The only benefit WRO offers
in this respect is that CO’s have been
allowed to work for the Welfare
Rights Organization. There is also a

Through A S

BY MARC SMALL

The cruelest reality of life is that
one is frequently forced to act in a
cruel—yet responsible—manner: for
example, when we spank a child for
playing in the street or when a po-
liceman kills a homicidal maniac.
In the face of this reahity, we con-
tinue to maintain a welfare struc-
ture that is, as the adage says, kill-
ing its victims with kindness.

At first glance it seems rational
and humane to give someone who is
down on their luck a little kindness:
“Just enough to tide me over until
I find a job!” the bindlestiff says as

‘we give him a dole. The surface

measure of charity is quite com-
mendable and manages to aid many

‘who are earnestly in distress.

However, when we approach the
structured gargantua of the welfare
programs, we also leave the realm
of reasonable charity and approach
an absurd plateau of human folly: a
‘woman in Chicago with several chil-
dren is given $15,000 per annum,
New York welfare recipients are
housed in the Waldorf-Astoria, and
all the while the National Welfare
Rights Organization continues to
lobby for greater and greater pay-
ments,

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

  

BY JEFFREY B. SPENCE
“the pursuit of its educational
purpose in a climate of learning that
stresses the importance of the in-
dividual, his personal honor and in-
tegrity, his harmonious relationship
with his fellow man, and his respon-
sibility to serve society through the
productivity of his training and his
talent.”

What you have just read is the
second basic fundamental punposet
that Washington and Lee states as
its institutional philosophy on page
seven of the newly released W&L
catalogue. This is certainly an ex-
cellent philosophy to have. If how-
ever, you continue to read on in the
catalogue you'll find some interest-
ing points of view both expressed by
insertion and omission.

To read our catalogue, you would
think that W&L would have us be-
lieve that the majority of students
here at school uphold the tie and
jacket tradition. This, of course, is
not true. If we further scrutinize the
catalogue one will not find pictured
anywhere any person who is black
or anyone who wears long hair. It
seems as if our alma mater would
rather that people believed that our
school is populated by straight white,
Anglo-Saxon, protestants exclu-
sively.

I do not show who is responsible
for the contest of our catalogue but
that person or group of persons is
either highly prejudiced or else
iblind. Contrary to popular opinion
this school is no longer lily-white,
nor for that matter does the student
body here look anything like the
student body that wanders around
the campus of Bob Jones University.

The second basic fundamental in
the W&L philosophy that I quoted
refers to the importance of the in-
dividual. If 1 was an individual on
this campus who was black, | would
certainly question how important
Washington and Lee seemed to think
I was. It seems from the apipearance
of the catalogue that blacks are not
only unimportant but that at this
school they are non-existent. Con-
sider for a second being black, how
would you respond to the W&L cata-
logue with its all white columns and
its all white people? I don't know
about you, but I would sure as hell
have serious second thoughts as to
whether I'd attend a school pictured
as ours is,

With Malice Toward Some

The Catalogue Fallacy

  
 
 

I am not so naive to believe that
public relations are unheard of at
W&L. I also realize that the catalo-
gue falls within the range of public
relations endeavors here at Wash-
ington and Lee. Public relations or
not, lying by omission is a serious
act to commit and it is equally as
bad as lying by commission. The sec-
ond phrase of the above quoted
statement refers to the stressing of a
man’s personal honor and integrity.

The catalogue, as presently con-
structed violates the integrity of
every black man and long-hair on
this campus, It is certainly no ex-
ample of \personal honor, when an
administration publication misrepre-
sents the institution by both word
and construct.

If the University believes its stated
philosophy, especially its third point
of having a harmonious relationship
with our fellow men, then let us see
some tolerance and understanding
from the top. If we are being groom-
ed here at W&L to meet our respon-
sibility to serve society through the
productivity of our training, then
why is not the institution that claims
these ideals for us living up to these
ideals also. What say you Admini-
stration? Peace.

Debate Squad
Riding High

“Despite limited size and experi-
ence, we have shown ourselves to be
on a competitive level with top rate
debate powers.” Sophomore Co-cap-
tain Bob Bruyere was speaking of
Washington and Lee's performance
in the ten debate tournaments at-
tended so far this year.

Making some long trips, as far
south as Florida and north as far as
New York and Baltimore, the debate
team has put in several very credit-
able performances. At the Univer-
sity of Florida Invitational Debate
Tournament, the W&L team placed
sixth out of fifty schools.

Later in the year, at the Delta
Sigma Rho-Tau Kappa Alpha Dis-
trict Debate Tournament, Washing-
ton and Lee combined a second
place negative team and a fourth
place affirmative team to take the

Scrimmages Helpful

Yale, Roanoke College
Battle Generals
On Lacrosse Field

With the completion of Saturday’s
scrimmage against Yale, W&L’s La-
crosse team is preparing for its regu-
lar season opener against Randolph-
Macon this Saturday. For the first
time this season, the Yellow Jackets
are competing with W&L in the
South Atlantic Division of the NC-
AA. Macon is loaded with talented
Baltimore high school graduates, and
they played the Generals to a 7-7
tie last year in the pre-season scrim-
mage. They are considered to be a
serious threat for the league cham-
pionship this year, as are the Gen-
erals, so the game should be a big
one.

In preparation for Saturday's open-
er, W&L has played in three scrim-
mages against Mt. Washington La-
crosse Club, Roanoke, and Yale.
These scrimmages have indicated
that W&L is much stronger at mid-
field than ever before, with the ad-
dition of eight freshmen. Co-captain
Whit Morrill, an All-American last
year, runs on one unit with fresh-
men Ted Bauer and John Lalley,
both of whom were first-team Alll-
Maryland as high school seniors.

Returning lettermen Chip Tomp-
kins and Jim McCane form a sec-
ond unit with freshmen Skip Licht-
fuss, another All-Maryland pick last
year, Freshman Jim Farrar joins
with lettermen Tim Winfield and
Ed Tognetti on the third midfield.
Sophomore John Conrad and four
more freshmen—Mark Morrill, Jim
Stieff, Ken Seal, and Rich Roman-
elli—provide the Generals with
greatly needed depth at midfield.

The midfields have, indeed, been

9999999099 O9099900900999

Capitol LP’s

bolstered. Of the 24 goals scored in
scrimmages, 15 were tallied by mid-
dies, as Whit Morrill had four, Bau-
er and Lichtfuss three apiece, Tog-
netti two, Mark Morrill, Lalley, and
Romanelli one each.

The attack also appears stronger
this year. Sam Englehart, last year’s
leading goal scorer, is playing crease
attack, and his five goals in pre-sea-
son indicate that he is ready for an-
other high scoring year. Co-captain
Scott Neese, an All-Conference pick
last year (along with Morrill, Engle-
hart, and goalie Bill Ingersoll) also
appears ready, having scored one
goal and 5 assists in the scrimmages.

Hank Slauson and Bob Brumback
are again battling for the third spot
on attack, but both will see consider-
able action, regardless of which one
starts. Each scored against Mt.
Washington, and Slauson added a
second against Roanoke. Matt La-
Motte and Bill Reinhoff complete
W&L’s attack.

On the defense, jobs are up for
grabs. Tommy Smith, Don EBaven-
son, John Rogers, and John Lar-
mour will all see plenty of playing
time, as could Ed McLaughlin, Bob
Radcliffe, and freshman Bob Turco.
The defense is very young, and its
ability to jell in the early season
could well determine W&L’s success.

The starting goalie spot is also
being hotly contested. Bill Inger-
soll, though All-Conference last
year, is being hard-pressed by fresh-
man Skeet Chadwick, another All-
Maryland high-schooler last year.
Both have been impressive so far,
teaming with Charlie Robson for a
shut out against Roanoke, and al-
lowing 4 each against Yale. Either
appears totally capable of handling
the job.

AND

 

LaRue’s Press Box

A lot of things got cleared up this
past weekend in ‘basketball action
across the country. Among other de-
velopments, South Carolina eeked
out a two point victory over rival
North Carolina for the Atlantic
Coast Conference championship in
a game seen by many on the tube.
And out west, UOLA settled once
and for all who is Number One, at
least in the Pacific Bight Conference.

Meanwhile, Jacksonville blew a
seventeen point lead in falling to
Western Kentucky. Houston, which
had earlier posted a one-point regu-
lar season win over the Florida
school, had its hands full with pesky
New Mexico in a Midwest contest.

In other action, Brigham Young
topped ‘Utah State, Fordham stomp-
ed Furman, Long Beach State rolled
past Weber, and Penn topped Duq-
uesne. In a Missouri Valley play-
off Drake rallied to conquer Louis-
ville and take the title.

All of which sets up some gems
for Thursday's regionals. For the
East, undefeated Penn takes on the
newly crowned ACC champion
Gamecocks and Villanova battles
Fordham. In the Mideast, in what
has to be one of the colossal en-
counters of the year, Adolph Ripp’s
Kentucky squad meets Western Ken-
tucky. The added attraction of Mar-
quette, the nation’s only other major
undefeated team, against Ohio State
makes Athens, Georgia the place to
be Thursday.

Meanwhile, Notre Dame and Aus-
tin Carr take on Drake while Hous-
ton goes against Big Eight champion
Kansas in the Midwest division. And
at Salt Lake City, the Cougars of
Brigham Young oppose top-ranked
UCLA, with Long Beach State and
the University of the Pacific clash-
ing in the nightcap.

 

NCAA Regionals, Finals

 

The winners advance to the re-
gional finals to be held Saturday,
with the surviving four teams head-
ing to the Astrodome for the finals
March 25 and 27.

Going out on a limb, we see
South Carolina handing Penn its
first loss and advancing to face Ford-
ham, the victor over Villanova, for
the Bastern laurels.

The Baron of the Bluegrass will
meet defeat as Western Kentucky
will advance to test Marquette’s
perfect skein. The University of
‘Houston will fall victim to Kansas,
while Notre Dame disposes of Drake.
UCLA is the natural choice over
‘Brigham Young with Long Beach
downing Pacific,

What happens from there is pure
speculation, but from this writer’s
view, the year’s tourney games are
not nearly as unpredictable as they
have been in years past. Barring any
upsets the only close game looks
to be that battle for the champion-
ship of Kentucky.

On the national level, track en-
thusiasts are buzzing about Jim
Ryan’s comeback. A bit closer to
home, the Washington and Lee com-
munity would do well to take note
of the comeback of its own track
program.

For the past couple of seasons,
the track and field program has been,
well, “informal.” However, _ this
spring the outlook is one of opti-
mism and enthusiasm,

The reasons for this dramatic

about face are two fold. Firstly, the
coaching is now the duty of two
very capable and dedicated men—
Coaches Aldridge and Stearns. Out
of a heretofore individual sport
they have begun to create a deal of
team unity and spirit in track. We
now have a track team, not a bunch
of individuals doing what they feel
like doing.

The second reason for this new
look is, of course, the performers
themselves. Never before has the
team been so blessed with the out-

 

Bill Brumback and Bim Clark both have qualified for the NCAA Col-
lege Division finals in swimming to be held this weekend at Springfield,
Mass. Brumback will be participating in his two specialities, the 50 and
100 yard freestyle, while Clark will swim the 50 freestyle and 100
butterfly.

Hard Schedule

The Generals, who enjoyed their
ibest season in history last year by
winning eight of 11 games, will play
six games at home this year, begin-
ning with Randolph-Macon on Sat-
urday, March 20, at 2:00 p.m.

Two other important games fol-
low the next week. On Monday,
‘March 22, W&L will host a group of
touring English College All-Stars.
These players represent the best la-
crosse players at Oxford, Cambridge,
Sandhurst, Liverpool and other Eng-
lish universities.

On Wednesday, March 24, W&L
will meet Dartmouth, always a tough
Ivy League competitor. The final
home game, on May 15 against
Duke, could well be for the South
Atlantic division chanypionship.

Head Coach Dick Szlasa is ex-
ipecting big things from the W&L
lacrosse team. Nearly everyone re-
turns from last year’s squad, and
will be joined by some top-notch
freshmen from the Baltimore area,
the nation’s hotbed of lacrosse.

Included are four boys who play-
ed in the high school All-Star Game
which preceded the college game last
June: goal-keepers Chuck St. Clair
and Skeet Chadwick and midfielder
Skip Lichtfuss of the Baltimore area,
and defenseman Bob Turco, who
played for the victorious New Jersey
All-Stars.

Among the veterans returning are
defenseman Bill Brumback, a first
team All-American selection last
year; midfielder Whit Morrill, a
third team All-American; and the
team’s two leading scorers, Sam En-
glehart (35 goals) and Scott Neese
(12 goals, 26 assists).

The Generals have some very im-
portant games on the road, includ-
ing contests against two of the three
national champions last year, Navy
and University of Virginia, and the
defending division champion, North
Carolina’s Tarheels. Ail games will
be at Wilson Field. There is no ad-
mission charge.

Doubleheader Opens Year

BY PALMER TRICE

Once again, we can hear that ery
in the sky, “Play ball!” Spring train-
ing is over for the Generals, and
the season is at hand. Coach Joe
Lyles and his squad hit the diamond
for real, and for the opening game
of the 1971 campaign this Saturday.
The season commences with a home
doubleheader with Long Island Uni-
versity. The opening day pitchers
have yet to be announced.

This year’s team should be both
“interesting and exciting.” The Gen-
erals will go with a fine infield, com-
posed of Bo Brookby at the hot

RUGBY NOTICE
The Rugby Team begins its spring
season on March 20 against the Key-
dets at VMI. Then on the 22nd the
Generals meet the University of
Massachusetts on the Upper Field.
Both games will be played at 1:30.

corner, Doug Clelan at short, Jim
Nolan at second, and Fred Paone at
first. The outfield will consist of
Captain Ray Coates, Bob LaRue,
and Dave Traylor. Jerry Johnson, a
freshman, has shown potential be-
hind the plate. The pitching staff
should be good, but lacks depth.
This, plus a lack of left handed hit-
ters, will be the two most pressing
problems for this year’s Generals.
Coach Lyles says that the talent is
there, but much of it is fresh, as he
lost nine players from last year’s
team, four of whom were due to
graduate.

done in the Executive Committee,
but this will not be a problem next
year. Once people are informed, it's
up to each individual to get involved,

However, a problem even more
crucial to life at W&L than the
complete apathy of some, is the ten-
dency of many others, to cfitiaize
things and not be prepared to do
something about it. Many people sit
back and take potshots at the E.C.,
Ring-tum Phi, Student Control Com-
mittee, or anything else at W&L
that bothers them, This is fine, to an
extent, for obviously there are many
alterations to various aspects of life
here that could be made. But the
complainers should be prepared to
do something about the things that
upset them in add'tion to their criti-
cizing .The perpe.uat fault-finder can
always find something to complain
about, but 1. is the truly concerned
individual that ‘dons something about
it. There is no place for the time-
worn phrases “I don’t want to get
involved,” or “I don’t have the
time.” There is too much that can
be done, with the new governmental
structure, if proper student support
is obtained.

So I say now is the time, for the
opportunity is here, to do something,
if we are ever to get anything done
in student government. There are
many problems facing the University
and its students, and it is going to
take the support and help of these
students to find the solutions.

cast to pull off a trick upon the audi-
ence. “Swan Song” is a dangerous,
difficult play to perform; Stack and
Reed perform it with much success.

The climax of the evening is “The
Boor,” directed by Carr Garnett.
Chekhov attributed the success of
this play to what he called “stupid
vaudeville.” Perhaps the playwright
is right about productions in Russia,
but Garnett’s direction and the per-
formance of his cast has made his
show |uman “vaudeville” and ex-
tremely funny.

The “Boor” who comes to the
house of a mourning widow is play-
ed brilliantly by Skip Paukert. The
comedy of his performance is con-
trolled and his timing throughout is
skillful. He establishes his character
from the moment he walks onto the
stage and plays believably with
Donna Shanklin, the widow. As Po-
pova, Miss Shanklin has a depth
which the subtle aspects of her
comic character requires, though her
broad comedy is a trifle overdone.
As her servant, Looka, Michael
Peppler has developed an hilarious
character. His reactions to the Boor
are subtle enough to make one of
his exits the closest thing to a show-
stopper in the play.

Garnett has done an admirable
job of interpreting “The Boor;” he
has evidently worked with his ac-
tors for believability in a play which
could very easily degenerate into not-
so-comic mugs at the audience. Greg
Buch’s set for the production is the
best of the five plays offered by the
student directors, but its effective-
ness is in the use Garnett makes of
the world which Buch has created.

on the rolls to look seriously for
employment: those receiving welfare
will, by and large, continue to re-
ceive it due to their own comfort and
the willingness of the social workers
to crack down and relieve the over-
burdened taxpayer of yet another
drag to his pecuniary advancement.

Cutting welfare off for someone in
the “able-but-unwilling” category
sounds cruel—but it would sharpen
their wits and senses as they pound
the pavement in search of that work
so many of us find vital to our sur-
vival. It would make far better citi-
zens of them, it would aid the com-
munity, it would contribute to the
general well-being, and it would
ease a portion of the complaints at
the exorbitant size of government
spending.

It is not always easy to do the re-
sponsible thing, yet the responsible
thing is always the simplest in the
long run. A strict pruning of the
welfare rolls would be harsh, but its
benefits would be more than com-
pensatory, and the effect on the indi-
vidual involved would turn him from

On the track itself, the Generals
are looking for outstanding perfor-

tances, Paul Suthern in the middle
distances.

Additional men to watch are fresh-
men Bill Wallace in the hurdles,
Garry Smith in the quarter and
Gary Bingham in the mile. The com-
bination of experience and fresh,
young talent, seems to indicate an
extremely pleasing rookie season for

a_ useless parasite into a contribut-
ing shareholder in our society.

Realizing employment is honestly
not always available, understanding
the difficulty of finding suitable
training, and comprehending the
stubborn runs of bad luck one can
have, this is not a call for a total
and definite dissolution of the dole
structure, but rather an attempt for
government to be more conscious of
the moral damage it does in support-
ing some worker who could find
work is it were not for the comfort
and ease of obtaining welfare. We
should cut back the structure that
exists now, we should aim at eventu-
ally erecting a more workable sys-
tem—but above all we should realize
that the financial dependence we
now give these on the dole destroys
the honour in a man and turns him
into no more than a slave whose
soul and body are shackled to the
overpowering bureaucracy of the
state,

Sha-Na-Na Coming;
Will Play Saturday
(Continued from Page 1)
Saturday afternoon will see the
17th ranked Washington and Lee la-
crosse team open its season on Wil-

son Field against Randolph-Macon.
With virtually everyone intact from

ast year’s fabulous stick team, the

Generals should be even more of a

poewrhouse this season. Randolph-

Macon’s team is a young one, as the
school has only recently taken up the
sport, but Yellow Jacket teams can
always be counted upon to give the
Blue a battle. Game time is set at
2:00 p.m.

On Saturday night a Sha-Na-Na
Weekend Date Night will be spon-
sored in Evans Dining Hall from
5:45-6:30 pm. The ARA Service
which runs Commons is featuring a
special meal in conjunction with the
Dance Board. Candlelight dinners
will include: tomato juice, London
broil (carved to order), whipped po-
tatoes, buttered whole kernels of
corn, green peas with mushrooms,
hot rolls with butter, tossed salad,
peach shortcake and beverages. The
Cost is $1.00 per couple for contract
students and $3.50 for non-contract
couples. Tickets are available at
Evans Dining Hall, Hurry because
the first 100 dates get a fresh flower
from the friendly folks at Commons.

And what would a weekend be
without a cocktail party? The junior
class will sponsor such an undertak-
ing Saturday afternoon in Red
Square 2:00-6:00 p.m. In case of
rain the event will be moved to the
Pavilion.

Steve Robinson, chairman of the
Student Recruitment Committee ap-
peared with a request for funds from
the EC. Robinson said a $5,000
grant had ‘been received for scholar-
ships. He hoped that another $500
could be raised from students and
organizations on the W&L campus.
Senior Representative Staman Ogil-
vie recommended that Robinson
check with class presidents for pos-
sible contributions. The EC took no
action with the understanding that
Robinson would appear later with
further details.

Lex McMillan, chairman of the
Curriculum Committee attended the
meeting with information about the
faculty evaluation being conducted
by his committee. A questionnaire
has been prepared, MoMillan report-
ed. The committee plans to mail
these questionnaires to one third of
the student body. By a unanimous
vote the EC allocated $50 to the

summer volunteer program, but the
only job available to these people
would be recruiting and organizing.
The reason for the emphasis on the
one-year program is that a high level
of commitment is necessary if one is

to be effective.

Although this is principally a vol-
unteer program, lack of funds should
not prevent anyone from applying.
VWRO will help volunteers raise
money to pay for living expenses
during the period of service. Cam
Crockett from Hollins raised money
for her summer service by holding
a “poor persons dinner” banquet.

The first meeting of all prospec-
tive volunteers will be March 25, at
which time the program will be ex-
plained in detail, biterature will be
handed out, and a VISTA film will
be shown. Then, until summer, the
volunteers will determine their train-
ing program, which should consist of
discussions, workshops, study and
practical training in the community.
Where the volunteer will be assigned
will be determined between the vol-
unteer and WRO. This may or may
not include areas around Lexington.
There will be more information
about the meeting next week and the
program posted on campus. For any
other details call: Kurt Krumperman
at 463-3885.

To conclude, active work is the
only way to solve the problems that
face us, The volunteer program of
VWRO is one means to help solve
the problem of poverty.

first place honors in the overall scor-
ing.
At the Johns Hopkins Invitational
Tournament in late January, W&L
entered two four man teams which
ranked fifth and ninth in the com-
petition between approximately 50
schools from 15 states. Sophomore
Co-captain Bob Bruyere placed
tenth out of one-hundred in indivi-
dual speaker competition, at the
same tournament,

Mentined by the captains as stand-
outs with this year’s team were
freshmen Tom Beard, Byran Mc-
Neil, Lennie Kaufman, and Averill
Harkey, sophomore Larry Evans,
junior Cal Seaton, and senior Bill
Radigan. The captains also felt that
a lot of the credit for the team’s per-
formance this year goes to Coach
Halford Ryan, who is in his first
year with Washington and Lee de-
bate.

Things look good for W&L de-
bate in the future. As sophomore
Co-captain Andy Bradshaw con-
cluded, “With a team made up pri-
marily of freshman and sophomores,
only one junior and one senior, we
show a lot of potential for the fu-
ture. Our debate team has been na-
tionally ranked consistently in the
past, and I think we can be up there
again in a year or two.”
