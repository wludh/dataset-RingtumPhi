IN JOINT

On Class of ’73

This report on the activities of
ithe Sophomore Class thus far this
year is being made in hopes of in-
forming and arousing interest in
‘the Sophomore Class by its mem-
bers. On November 17th, a Sopho-
more Class meeting was called to:
(1) find out the general attitude of
ithe Sophomore Class (2) to report on
the budget of the class and (3) to
announce that applications were be-
ing accepted for a Sophomore com-
mittee which would decide how the
surplus money would be used and
which weu!ld hopefully draw the
class closer, together.

Having left the freshman dorms,
students live in a widespread area
and many have contact with the
people they knew as Freshmen. We
find it increasingly difficult to get a
true picture of the class’ needs and
desires. It is our hope that through
this committee we can regain the
sense of unity our class had as fresh-
men,

At the class meeting we had a

ll tunn-out. A total of 18 pe»
ple came. Some people later remark-
ed that they didn't see the posters,
but for the most part, the small at-
tendance was due to the age-old
problem of apathy. Last year our
Freshman class displayed more unity
than most classes ever do; but it ap-
pears that this year, having lost the
day to day associations we had in
the dorms, that our class is gradually
developing the W&L tradition of
apathy.

The following was discussed at the
Sophomore class meeting: (1) The
Budget: $2300 was collected in class
dues and was spent in the following
manner:

$1321.00 for grain

$ 300.00 for the band

$ 40.44 for cups

$ 76.80 for mix

$ 27.09 trash cans and servers
$ 26.00 for ice

$ 12.50 for posters

$ 12.50 for a garden hose

for a total of $1,816.33.

Left in the class treasury is ap-
proximately $500 and (2) How to
use the surplus money? We have
thought of four possibilities: (a) We
can pool our money with the Junior
class and turn the Springs Weekend
cocktail party into a semi-rock festi-
val with four or five good bands and
a bar, (b) hold a sophomore class
party with a good band and set-ups

Contact Studies High

BY SKIP PAUKERT

A nationally prominent history
professor, an advocate of the New
Right, and a lawyer from the New
Left were featured in the opening
programs of “Contact '71” this week.
All three gentlemen addressed them-
selves to topics related to this year’s
theme, “the Crisis in Education.”

“Contact,” an annual symposium
on contemporary issues and prob-
lems, offered its initial presentation
Monday with Dr. K. Ross Toole.
The “Contact” speeches will con-
tinue through next week.

Dr. Toole, a professor of history
at the University of Montana, re-
ceived national attention with the
publication of his article, “The Ty-
ranny of Spoiled Brats,” in several
national periodicals,

Dr. Toole demonstrated himself
to be much of a political liberal in
his views on current issues. He ad-
dressed his speech “to those of you
who may be thinking about giving
up on the system.” He emphasized
that the American political scheme
was imperfect and that reforms were
badly needed, both in foreign and
domestic policy, but he urged that
change must come peacefully and

that recourse to violence was
real alternative.”

Toole pointed to the gathering at
Woodstock as an example of the

latent solidarity and power of youth

“no today. “You must learn the poi'tical

process, and you must learn how to
utilize power,” he said.

Toole criticized student activists
today for being, above all, “myopic.”

Watt Appointed College Dean;
Pusey Steps Down To Teach

The President of the University
announced Monday that Dr. Wil-
liam J. Watt will accept the duties of
Dean of the College, effective next
July 1. He succeeds Dean William
Webb Pusey III, who is returning to
full-time teaching after 11 years of
service as head of the university's
arts and sciences division.

It was revealed that Dean Pusey
had indicated his desire to return to
the chassroom to the Board of Trus-
tees last summer, He will resume his
duties as professor and chairman of
the German Department.

Dr. Watt presently serves as as-
sociate dean of the College. There
was no suggestion as to when or
how a successor will be named to
that post.

Dr. Watt has been a member of
the faculty since 1955. He received
a Bachelor of Science Degree from
the University of Minos in 1949, a
master’s degree from Cornell Uni-
versity in 1951, and his Ph. D. from
Cornell in 1956,

Dr. Pusey came to Washington
and Lee in 1939, the year he earned
his Ph.D. degree from Columbia
University. He also holds a B. S. de-
gree from Haverford College and
an M.A, degree from Harvard.

He served as Acting President of
the University from late 1967 unti
President Huntley took office on
February 5, 1968.

In Monday's announcement Presi-
dent Huntley offered his “deep zrati-
tude—and that of all associated

 
 

with Washington and Lee—to Dr.
Pusey for his decade of invaluable
service as dean.” He added that Or.
Pusey’s “patient and thoughtful lea/-
ership has given the university a
quality of true academic strength,
which will be abiding.”

The selection of Dr. Watt to as-
sume duties as dean of the College,
the president said, “commends itself
on every ground—ability, scholar-
ship, experience.”

er Education

He traced the history of the labor
and farm movements in the United
States, and the reforms brought
about by LaFollette’s Progress ves
and the labor unions, “But you must
have patience, courage, and, »bove
all, tenacity,” he continued.

Toole urged that students begin
to exercise their potent power by
using such tools as the boycott. In
answer to a question on national
priorities, he listed (1) the eradica-
tion of poverty, (2) the preservation
of the ecology, and (3) the resiora-
tion of universities as teaching in-
stitutions,

In answer to another question,
Toole advocated the immediate with-
drawal of U.S, forces from Vietnam,
saying “I haven't met a hawk in

three years.”

Tuesday brought the pairing of
two very unique speakers having a
mutually extensive background in
radical movements. Philip Abbott
Luce, a former Communist and rev-
olutionary, broke with the Left in
1965 and turned to the right wing,
culminating in his work with the
Young Americans for Freedom as
head of their college division.

Leonard Weinglass, an attorney
for many of the nations most promi-
nent leftists, was co-counse! for the
defense with William Kunstler at the
“Chicago 8” trial.

Mr. Luce began his day on camp-
us with a seminar in the afternoon
in the Student Center library, where
he recounted his political evolution
from editor of the national organ of
the communist Progressive Labor
Party to an advocate of rightist lib-
ertarianism.

Luce oniticized the coercive nature
of the state in many elements of
American life, especially education.
In his speech in Lee Chapel Tues-
day evening, he prefaced his re-
marks by saying, “the whcle of the
public educational system is deca-
dem, and we are in need of revoiu-
tionary ideas.”

“I oppose state education because
of its very nature,” he said. Not only

did he think that governmental von-
trol kept down the potential quality
of education, but also “it ‘s implicit
in that educational process that there
is an attempt to indoctrinate stu-
dents in an allegiance to the
state...”

He emphasized the importance of
the years in a child's life from ages
1-5, which are wasted under the
status quo. He also characterized
the 12 years of public primary and
secondary education as “to a large
degree, simply a device to keep you
off the streets,”

Troubs Offer

New Drama

In Shakespeare's “Hamlet” there
are two minor characters which have
little to do with the action of the
Bard’s most famous tragedy. Rosen-
crantz and Guildenstern are two
gentlemen who are appointed by the
King of Denmark to discover the
cause of Hamlet's madness.

They are dead by the conclusion
of the play.

Tom Stoppard’s “Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead” focuses on
the fate of this hapless pair. It is a
comedy, however, and it will be per-
formed here on February 9 through
13 by the Troubadour Theatre.

“Auditions were, thankfully, in
December,” said Mrs. Bilen Barnes,
director for the production. Speak
ing of the rehearsals, Mrs. Barnes
noted that “we're not there yet, but
we're on our way.”

The cast has been in rehearsal for
the production since before the
Christmas holidays. Which is as it
should be, for the Troubadour
Theatre plans to take the show on a
tour to other colleges in Virginia be-
fore it comes home to W&L for 4
five night run. Performances of “Ro-
sencrantz and Guildenstern” will be
given at Mary Baldwin, Randolph
Macon, Roanoke College, Radford,
and the University of Richmond
during its run on tour February 2
through the 6th.

_Stoppard’s play weaves the scripi
of “Hamlet” throughout the course
of his comedy. Yet the action of the
play centers primarily on the comic
and sometimes pathetic befuddle-
mem of Rosencrantz and Guilden
stern as they attempt to unravel the
mystery of their situation in the in-
trigue of the court of Denmark.

“I suppose I would be lying to
anyone if I told them | totally Un-
derstood the play,” said Mrs, Barnes
“I think it’s a brilliant piece, but |
don't think anyone would be telling

Five Speakers Remaining To Fill Toole, Luce, Weinglass Launch

Our Mini-‘Crisis In Education’

Interesting isn’t it, that with the beginning of “Contact thy”
we have had the appearance of a group which sat in the Co-op
this week asking for signatures to end R.O.T.C. credit at the
University. It would seem that the members of this group were
attempting to create its own mini-“Crisis in Education” in
order to make “Contact '71” more “relevant.”

Apart from the fact that they're belatedly attempting to get
into the act along with the distinguished speakers W&L is
fortunate enough to have here during this week, this group of
students seems to have a murky conception of the word “edu-
cation,” hence the mini-crisis.

The demand for the elimination of academic credit for
R.O.T.C. is as absurd as the demand that a study of the Re-
naissance be put to a vote of the gtudent body to test its “rele-
vancy.” The points is, education is not democratic or even a
matter of casting a vote for or against one course. If it were,
there would be several students we know who'd vote against
courses throughout the school because of the grade they re-
ceived last term or because they thought the professors too
liberal, too dull, or too conservative.

We doubt that many of the people in this group are enrolled
in R.O.T.C. We doubt that they would appreciate it if people
fro mother persuasions started a petition to eliminate philoso-
phy or english or politics or drama credit. “Relevance” cannot
be defined by one’s own personal perspective. If it were, then
there would be no courses at W&&L offered for credit. The
armed forces (fortunately or unfortunately) are as much of the
reality of everyone's common experience here and elsewhere as
is the question of the economic future of the United States. The
problem students have to cope with is not whether R.O.T.C.
should be offered for credit, but whether or not they should
take R.O.T.C. for credit.

(It amuses us that no moral arguments would likely be
raised at all if there weren't a war going on somewhere which
threatened the immediate future of students on this campus.
The moral arguments take the stand that R.O.T.C. is not aca-
demic, but the real motivation behind this argument is anti-
war beliefs of this group of students.)

The real crisis in the educational system today is the misuse
of the word “education.” We hope that tempests in teapots
such as the thinly disguised political line “end R.O.T.C. credit”
will not affect the bright future education has here.

The Craze: Retrospective

It tends to be that our arithmetic was slightly in error last

week.

200 Honor Roll students

+400 Dean's List students

=Not 600 but 400 Honor Roll and Dean's List students.

So our casual estimate of one-half of the student body mak-
ing Dean's List and Honor Roll is reduced to 36 percent. Even
with this reduced percentage, the significance of this marked
rise in figures is not diminished. We reiterate our proposal that
requirements for Dean's List should be changed from 3.0 to
3.2 and those for Honor Roll from 3.5 to 3.6.

Especially in view of the fact that the Class of 1971 was one
of the contributing factors in the rise of the percentage for this
term. 162 out of the 262 members of the class made a GPR of
3.0 or above, with 73 seniors on the Honor Roll. One wonders
whether the overall intelligence of the senior class has mel-
lowed with age here at W&L. Whether it has or not is a moot
point. However, we think the more stringent requirements for
recognition of academic distinction are necessary and valid,

Dropping Drop-Add Bureaucracy

In the past four years, this paper has seen an incredible
amount of change. Some of it has been good, some bad, but at
least the driving motive has been one of improvement. One
can look back and be proud of the fact that we have changed.

But in all our change something seems to have been left
untouched. It recurs twice annually, but the aggravation ts
short-lived and goes before one has time to really notice it,
generally speaking. However, we have had trouble with it, and
it has remained in our minds,

It is not uncommon to spend two days changing one’s
schedule. One must first track down at least four signatures
whose authors always seem to be away, After walking from
the two course professors, the student must go to the Dean
and waste his time making sure that everything is all right
To add insult to injury, the course changes cost $5

In a school that prides itself on a personal touch, and in a
.chool where data processing is used quite efficiently in an ad
ministrative capacity, it seems absurd that the archaic system
of course changes is allowed to exist as it does

The funny thing is that the needed change ts really quite
simple, All the student should have to do is go to his advisor
and ask for the change. If the Deans feel it is necessary to make
sure everything is functioning properly, they should have a list
of changes sent to them

I'm sure that less than five per cent of the course changes
are in error in some way (besides actual mistakes on the Drop
\dd slips). This school must take in a couple of thousand dol
lars on course changes, Well, maybe taht’s permissible, but the
fee should not be used as a deterrent

Washington and Lee’s CONTACT
‘71 symposium, focusing on the gen-
eral theme, “The Crisis in Educa-
tion,” will continue with a broad
cross-section of speakers.

Friday night Dr. Charles Hamil-
ton of Columbia University will
speak in Lee Chapel. Dr. Hamilton
will discuss “Ohanging and Ex-
panding Curricula for Blacks and
Whites.”

Hamilton, professor of Urban
Studies at Columbia, was co-author
with Stokeley Carmichel of Black
Power: Politics of Liberation in
America. A discussion period will
follow the address.

On Monday, U.S. Senator Mark
O. Hatfield, (R.-Ore) will offer an
address in Evans Dining Hall. Hat-
field, prominent member of the Sen
ate and co-sponsor of a controver-
sial Cambodian legislation is for-
imerly an associate professor and
dean of students at Williamette Uni-
versity in Salem, Oregon.

Hatfield, whose recent bout with
flu necessitated a change in the ori-
ginal CONTACT ‘71 schedule, will
be the guest of honor at a cocktail
party at the Psi Upsilon House start-
ing at 7 p.m. His speech will be fol-
lowed by a question and answer
period.

The Senator is expected to speak
en “Reordering Our Priorities: In-
creased Aid to Higher Education.”

On Tuesday, Dr. David Donald,
the Harry G. Black Professor of His-
tory at The Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity, and a Pulizter Prize winner,
will deliver the Lee’s Birthday,
Founer's Day Convocation at noon
in Evans Hall.

CONTACT resumes on Wednes-
day, January 20 with the appear-
ance of Dr. Arthur Hansen, presi-
dent of the Georgia Institute of
Technology. Hansen, described by
CONTACT chairman Madison Cole
as a “dynamic speaker” will address
himself to the topic, “Technology,
Our Terror or Our Triumph,”

The symposium will conclude on
Friday, January 22, with the joint
appearance of Rep. Philip Crane,
(R.-Il.) and Dr. Harald Taylor.

Crane, a prominent conservative,
was elected to the Senate in 196).
Taylor was formerly president of
Sarah Lawrence College, and he was
noted for innovations, among them
the “Free University” concept. He
is the author of Students Without
Teachers: The Crisis in the Univer-
sity.

Both men will conduct afternoot
seminars, Crane in Reid Hall, and
Taylor in the University Center Li-
brary.

Dr. Taylor will be honored at ¢
cocktail party at the Phi Kappa Sig-
ma house at 7 p.m.

Contact chairman Matt Cole urges
all students to make the fullest use
of the opportunities presented by
this year’s symposium possible. The
fact that the student body finances

and IFC co-sponsorship means that
the speakers visit the campus for
the benefit of all students.

The support of the student body
will mean that in the future we can
enjoy programs such as this, and
can continue to attract key people in
the country to the symposium.

However, to provide speakers such
as Dr. Hamilton, Sen. Hatfield, Dr.

In the past two evenings “Con-

different forms of discussion, one in-
telligent and enlightening the other
bland and embarrassing. Surprising-
ly enough they came from the
sources we least expected.

Last night in Lee Chapel Philip
Luce and Leonard Weinglass en-
gaged in something less than a de-
‘bate. I fully expected a knock-down-
drag-out affair but was pleasantly
surprised with the civility and per-

who was there will attest to the fact
that there seemed to be little dis-

Feb. 16—DIAL M FOR MURDER

—Directed by Alfred Hitchcock.
Starring Ray Milland, Grace Kelly
and Robert Cummings. The cinema's
supreme master of the art of “su-
spense” makes unoanny use of the
color camera to play on the mount-
ing fear and the nerve-cracking ten-
sion as the husband cunningly weaves
a web of seeming guilt which would
convict his wife of deliberate mur-
der.

Feb. 23——-NEVER GIVE A SUCK-
ER AN EVEN BREAK—W. (
Fields, Glorma Jean, Lion Errol

“Anyone who hates dogs and chil
tren can't be all bad.”

The W&L Film Committee will
hold an informal discussion to select
films for the remainder of the year
on Thursday, at 7 p.m. All interesied
people are urged to come to the
Cockpit,

teresting to note that in many ways
we saw a result of two peopie who
are described as “left” and “right”
coming into agreement because they
have come full circle on the political
spectrum, which is, in my way., re-
assuring. Restricting themselves, for
the most part, to the field of educa-
tion, they made some very important
points. Luce in his opening renvaerks
made the point that public education
in America has failed and thar it
exists primarily for the benefit and
continuance of the state. It feil upon
Weinglass to defend the state and
the necessity for the state to be re-
sponsive. This struck me as strange
coming from a member of the “New
Left.” It seems to me that if any-
thing revolutionary groups, whom
Mr. Weinglass counts as his clients,
are Opposed to the monolith that is
the government. But the basic point
remains that Mr. Weinglass and Mr.
Luce are both opposed to the form
the government has taken today and
especially in its relation to educa-
tion.

I would have to draw as ther
point of disagreement their attitudes

bout what the new posture of edu
cation and of government should be.
Mr. Luce made it quite chear that he
feels that an attitude of laissezfaire
towards education is necessary. He
felt that the parents should take up
the total responsibility for their chil-
dren’s education. Mr. Weinglass
countered with the salient point that
thi swould be difficult if not impos-
sible to accomplish in the Black
community or in Poverty areas,
Weinglass felt that the state is noi
teaching what is relevant or impor-
tant. He felt that in our “post-in-
dustrial” world we must be open to
anything and everything for our edu-
gation to be effective. He also
brought up the point of community
in relation to the campus environ-
ment. He said that four years in co!
lege isolate us from our communit:
and leave us in a limbo that we
never really get out of. This i:ola-
tion resulis in the creation of an
elite and an elite that is not in com-
munication with the other segments
of the society.

What one came out with here is
that education is primarily a tool
of the state so the siate can continue.
It is obvious that they both are dis-
enchanted with their education and
the one we are receiving. Luce’s
thesis that we should adopt a laisse ’-
faire policy is to me misguided and
can only end in greater disassocia
tion between individuals and be-
tween individuals and the society
itself. Weinglass was far more hon-
est about the role of the state and
the necessity for the slate to reform
so that it can educate with openness,
and effoct-veness. Luce is too quick
to abandon the state for in a society
such as ours the state is not a luxury

Hl 1S & Necessity.

Monday night again in the Chapel
Dr. K. Ross Toole had “Some Com
ments on Student Revolutionaries”.
In a low key address Dr. Yoole
brought out some important and
overlooked problems about student
activism in politics, Dr. Toole told
his audience that America has in the
past overcome her problems and we
will, he hopes, do so again. He be-
moaned the fact that there is a min
ority of students who have given up
on the American system and that
they hyperbolize to point or, to use
his word, they are “myopic”, He
made the point that the McCarthy
campaign showed thal students cin
exert political power but tha: for
some reason it failed in the end. He
claimed that when the revolutionary
says that we have no power he either
lies or is ignoram. One need only

Through A Spyglass Darkly ...

’Riting Off The Corps? :

  

(Editor’s Note: We welcome Mack
Woodward, a junior majoring in
history, to The Ring-tum Phi as a
weekly columnist. We invite your
comments on his views, which are,
we note, not necessarily those of
The Ring-tum Phi.)

BY MACK WOODWARD

“End ROTC Credit,” demand the
signs. “Sign the petition inside.”
One wonders exactly why military
science should not be offered for
credit. Is it not as “relevant” as
other courses offered, as “relevant”
as Classics 309? Doubtful. Perhaps
ROTC should be banned from camp-
us as an indication of sentiment
against the war in Vietnam.

Adding and dropping courses to
protest government policy does not
seem logical, however. It especially
does not seem logical in connection
with the idea of “University Com-
munity” that was so au courant last
spring. The idea of University Com-
munity would seem to indicate that
there is—or should be—some sense
of unity among all elements of the
University. Community and unity
imply—to me—a sense of respec!

ments: “, . . wave your freak flag
high,” if you please; don’t stop me

 

  

from wearing a coat and tie if I so
desire. Do what you like as long as
you are not barbarous about it.

Ending credit for military train
ing would be completely devoid of
respect for others’ preferences. End-
ing credit for military training per-
haps would demonstrate a lack of
support of the war in Southeast Asia;
there are, however, those of us who,
if it weren’t for military service,
would be shipped out soon after
graduation; military science at least
gives those who desire it a chance
to avoid being in the middle of «
rice paddy surrounded by Viet Cong.
Dropping military science from the
list of courses offered for credit jeo-
pardizes the idea of academic free-
dom which many of us cherish.

Nor would ending military sci-
ence credit end the war in Southeasi
Asia—no more than wearing aa
armband or picketing Newcomb
‘Hall would end the war. Foreign
policy, one hopes ,is not determined

Washington and Lee was for
many years a quiet southern college
that went on about its daily business
basically undisturbed. Last May all
that changed. When Nixon ordered
the invasion on Cambodia the na-
tion’s colleges and universities went
out on strike. Not to be outdone,
Washington and Lee joined with its
academic brethren in expressing its
extreme dismay over the President's

A lot of activity started happen-

Within about two days of the first
demonstration here on campus, a
group of students had drawn up a
resolution to shut down the school:

Outside, Looking In
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

When I first appeared at this Uni-
versity some three and a half years
ago, I came armed with a completely
new wardrobe of coats, ties and
cuffed slacks. These were clearly not
the type of clothes | would wear at
home. I had been used to wearing
white socks and white levis to class
all through my high school days.

But I had been told that W&L was
a coat and tie school and that my
styles would clearly be out of place.
Being a meek and quiet freshmen I
conformed so as not to rock the
boat.

As time passed, I even began to
like wearing a jacket and tie to class.
Nobody ever took me to task for it
and cuffed slacks had long since
ceased to bother me. I was aware
that some students had fallen off a
bit from the patterns of conventional
dress, but I continued on detiber-
ately, secure in the knowledge that
| was conforming to the accepted
standard

Surely you can imagine the great
blow to my sensibilities when one
day in my senior year I discovered
in an editorial that not only were
some students not wearing coats and
ties, but that they had even ceased
to be considered desirable by the
EC. For the supreme establishnwn-

STUDENTS!

tartan, who had worn a coat and tie
to every class for the last two years,
this was a terrible realization. I was
no longer a conformist, but a non-
conformist.

Now I have a problem. After all
these years of wearing a coat and tie
to class, I'm not sure that I can
break the habit. I'm also unsure of
whether I can find any jeans (with
at least one patch). These are hardly
the type of clothes that can be
bought

As a senior, however, I still don’t
want to rock the boat. I am hesitam
to wear a jacket and tie to class if I
will offend anyone by my non-con-
formity. But I'm too set in my ways
to change.

Therefore, I beg of the EC to con-
sider giving me a special dispensa-
tion to continue wearing a coat and
tie on campus, I am still much too
timid to be a non-conformist, and
such a dispensation would be a great
relief.

Roy D. Carlton, ‘7i
P.S.—Another untraditional idea bas
been gradually creeping into my
mind which may find asylum among
some of the more unconventional
people on this campus. It is the mat-
ted of the University’s name. Why
honor those two? Many people have
given us more money thar St.
George. And the traditions of St.
Bob are all but gone. So why con-
tinue with the farce? I think a far
more descriptive name for our in-
stitution would be the Univeisity of
Lexington.

“Rising Sap” Is Negative
To the Editor of The Ring-um Phi:

whether or not to pen the thoughts
which have been running through
my mind partially in response to
R. Baroody’s comment on “Love
Story” and in part independently of
that stimulus.

on “Love Story” because it oozed

tive action try to bring about reform

ence. | am aware of vast apparently

they were not helping before “Love
Story” appeared. No damage is done
on that count.

“Love Story” was a beautiful
book. It was pleasant with happiness
and realistic with grief. In short, I
feel it dealt honestly with human
emotions other than indignance, dis-
illusion, protest and negativism.
This is healthy.

It seems that our society, especi-
ally the younger segment, has wal-

On “Love Story” Attack
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

I was disgusted when I read Rob-
ert Baroody’s article, “On Rising
Sap,” a criticism of Erich Segal’s
“Love Story.” I feel that Baroody is
misled in his ideas and that his criti-
cism is overly harsh.

Baroody is unnecessarly bombas-

tic in his article. My first impression
was that author Baroody seemed to
be a high school student trying dili-
gemly to impress his teacher with
some big words and apparently
“heavy” thoughts on such a simple
subject as “Love Story.” In fact, I
even had to look up the word “pue-
rile” which Baroody used in his
paper.
Of course, that may be expected
of a boy from the South Louisiana
swamps, but I still find it unneces-
sary to us such a “thick” vocabulary
for this sort of topic. “Diarrhea” was
uncalled for also. Why doesn’t Ba-
roody just come out and say that he
just did not appreciate “Love Story?”
It would have been more appropriate
and probably more effective.

Baroody says that “Segal’s story-
telling style is almost admirable in
its modern simplicity; and that the
film .. . is technically proficient,
but not elaborate.” Unfortunately,
Baroody has missed the main obje:-
tive of Segal in “Love Story” to be
simple and unelaborate. It was
meamt to be just that—a love story,

which was passed by the largest vote
turn-out in a long time. Those of us
who were here then remember the
Free University, U. Va., Jerry Ru-
bin, and William Kunstler. Many a
student at W&L, whether liberal or
not, was understandably enraged
over the Cambodian action.

The strike’s subsequent verbiage
lead into many other important areas
of the American political scene.
Topics like Bobby Seale, the Black
Panthers, the environmental destruc-
tion, and the value of our own edu-
cation were on the minds and ton-
gues of many of us. It was a unique
happening here at W&L as it was
reflecting on what happened last
May.

Not too long after the May crisis
I heard someone commenting on
what happened here at W&L. The
gist of what this person said was:
where was all of that student ferver
and energy when the blacks and the
poor of the area around them nee:-
ed it?” For years W&L has been en
island of wealth in a sea of poverty.
Where has that concern of last May
gone?

How many of us really went home
to work for peace or equality?
Since arriving back at school what,
if anything, has been done to im-
prove relations and engender under-
standing between the school and the
local townspeople. The spending of
large sums of money does not really
bring about a meeting of the minds.
What agency, if any, left over from
the strike is doing anything to help
the people who hive in the surround-
ing area climb out of their heli of
poverty?

Let's face facts, now thai the
threat to us has been minimized or
negated we have gone back to the
good old days, before the strike.
When the only things we were con-
cerned about were ourselves. The
national strike committee, says a
rumor, is ready to declare a new

Football Fades to Memory

It’s sort of a transitional period
right now. Football is just about
over; only the Super Bowl, and its
lady-in waiting, the Pro Bowl, re-
mains. All this and that teams ap-
pear, sprinkled throughout the sports
sections like rice flung at a wedding.

On the college campuses through-
out the nation, the attention of stu-
dents and alumni is now focused for
the most part on the basketball court
instead of the football field, as two
groups of quints battle to put a
brown ball into the orange hoop.
And upstairs, its all for money.

Televisions are strangely quiet,
as the noisy blare of “fourth and
inches for the Wolverines,” fades
oul, returning only as a memory. A
sooty covering of ice and snow ‘s
the only spectator seated in most of
the stadia of the nation. Those cheap
hot dogs that always managed to
taste like a seven course meal from
the Four Seasons are out of reach at
least until next season. And that
guy with the pennant, the one who
always rooted for the other team,
who always used to give you prob-
lems if you dropped mustard on his
collar, is suddenly a lost friend.

 

Then there was scalping. Oh, you
can always, (well, almost always,)
scalp tickets to the games, but there
was never the thrill of a sale unless
the multitudes were pouring into the
stadium. Remember how happy you
were when the guy with the suspici-
ous looks, the one who had frown-
ed disapprovingly when you sold
your six dollar ticket for seven dol-
lars, just shook his head and walked
off?

But the measure of worth as a
salesman came not as a scallper, but
rather, when you could sell a thirty-
yard line seat for the full face value,
even if the game was far from a
sell-out.

Once inside if you were lucky,
someone nearby might even be
knowledgeable enough to explain
the strategy, the whys and what fors
that make football so interesting.
Someone, perhaps your Dad. There
was always excitment, be it that
long, arching throw which made you
wait breathlessly in anticipation of
its fate, or the sudden realization
that your man had just side-stepped
two defenders and was striding fr
the end zone.

Or maybe it was the desperate
prayer for those guys to become ele-
ven demons to stop the enemy with
a brilliant goal-line stand.

And afterwards, those broken-
down sportswriters using the same
cliches to describe the game. That
was football season and I realiy miss
it.

Winners In Florida

BY PALMER TRIC!

With the completion of their Fior-

ed Sunday to the snows of the frigid
North. Their venture into che land
of milk and honey proved only par-
tially successful. The record tor the
Classic was only 1-1, but to use the
old phrase, they knew that we had
been there. In the opening bout, our
boys took on the undefeated corps
of King College. The Generals, who
started off well enough to earn an
11 point lead at the half, were nipp
ed by a score of 54-48. King went
into the game 10-0, a heavy favorite.
They came away respecting the WAL
defense, which is either 14th or 15th
in the nation, among small colleges.

The Generals shot a poor 31% from
the floor, and took 16 less foul shots
than did King. Problems for the
squad were lack of movement, both
with and without the ball, and la:k
of poise. Attempts to get the ball in-
side against the bigger opponents
failed. Despite a super defensive
performance, a lack of offensive
punch brought the General downfall
in the opening round.

rhe second contest found the Gen-
erals in their famed match-up de-
fense. In addition to this, they em-
ployed a full court zone press. This
proved to ‘be the key to the General

Bryce Mountain--Ski Resort?

 

:
This past Saturday was spent at
Virginia’s only accredited Nostar
skiing area, Bryce Mountain. That is
to say, it’s the best slope in Virginia
(of course, it doesn’t get much com-
petition from The Homestead).

But I was a bit disheartened to be
told I had arrived at Bryce Moun-
tain without realizing wt. Though
small, however, there was some clial-
lenge ahead.

Dhe first was that of ski rental. If
by any chance you can beg, borrow,
or steal your equipment, please, for
your sake, do so. You can spend up
to an hour in that one little room.
Your best bet is to run by Pres
Brown's and see what they can do
for you, The total package is an

  

very long, so that you spend 80 per
cent of your time in line, 10 per cent
on the slopes, and the remaiing 19
per cent inside drinking ‘beer.

But it was a lot of fun. There were
a lot of W&L people there, along
with an assortment of Hollins, Bald-
win, and U.Va. students. And, with
all its drawbacks, Bryce offered
pretty decent skiing. The snow,
though icy in spots, was quite ski-
able, and the advanced slope, though
not too difficult, was at least an on-
joyable run. There are two other
runs. One is a long beginner’s run,
and the other has a relatively steep
face and is much shorter.

It’s a great place for beginners. It
seems they are there in abundance
on the weekend, And everyone seems

 

astoundingly high $7.50 at Bryce. At
that rate, one could afford tu be
fully (and nicely) equipped after
some 15 outings.

Lift tickets are $6 for students on
weekends. This gives you access to
two chairs and a rope tow. This
doesn't help too much, however, be-
cause the lines after 10 asm. are 45
minutes long, and the runs aren't

to have a good time just being there.
The serious skier must realize that
he’s at Bryce and go from there.
But the best bet is to go up during
the week. There will be smaller
crowds and more skiing, but maybe
that’s not the purpose of Bryce. It’s
not Vail, you know.

Good night, McTurks; see you
next year,

Swimming Team

Falls To Duke
By 59-54

The Washington and Lee Gen-
erals’ swim team, under the leader-
ship of Coach Bill Stearns, travelled
to Duke University on Friday, Janu-
ary 8 for a dual meet. The result: a
59-54 setback for the watermen.

An easy victory was within reach,
but as Coach Stearns pointed out,
the lack of depth in the two diving
events forfeited valuable points. As
usual, the eight man varsity squad
displayed superb individual effort.

All-American Bill Brumback, the
team’s senior captain, was a Jouble
individual winner in the 50 yard
freestyle with a personal season best
of 22.4, and in the 100 yard free-
style, with an anchor on the winn‘ng
400 yard freestyle relay.

Brumback’s two efforts have gain-
ed him qualifying berths in the na-
tional championships coming on
March 19-20-21 in Springfield, Mass
achusetts. Also landing himself in
the nationals is freshman Steve Eric-
son, posting a blistering 58.4 in the
100 yard backstroke for first place.

Sophomore Alan Corwith won the
200 yard freestyle and was a mem-
ber of the winning 400 yard free-
style relay. John Lawlor, a junior,
snatched the blue ribbon in the in-
dividual medley and Bim Ciark’s
performance almost assures him a
nationals’ berth within the next cou-
ple of meets.

This Saturday afternoon at 2 p.m.
the Doremus gym pool, the swim-
mers host always tough Virginia.
Coach Stearns expects another close
battle and says that the diving events
could prove to be the diiference.
The team has been practicing an
average of 10,000 yards a week since
December 28 and the devotion inns
far has pleased Coach Stearns to
the point that he expects to curry on
the tradition of successive winning
seasons.

BILL BRUMBACK

Wrestlers Pinned By UNC

The Washington and Lee wrestling
team has had several disappoint-
ments since their initial victory over
Guilford. Shut out by the Cavaliers
from the University of Virginia and
beaten by both Duke and Dickinson,
the Generals went against the Uni-
versity of North Carolina last Sat-
urday, January 9, at Chapel Hill.

Unfortunately, this year’s match
with U.N.C., like last year’s, was a
heartbreaker, with the Generals los-
ing closely by a score of 22-20. Tir-
ed by a long night trip to Chapel
Hill and weakened by a virus that
had hit the team, the Generals were
at a disadvantage before the match
even began.

The General's best match of the
meet was the first one, at 118
pounds, with Pat Buford pinning his
opponent in a matter of seconds.
Nexit, at 126 pounds, Bruce Hyait
won by a forfeit, as did his succes-
sor, Craig Hankins, at 134. At 142
pounds, Bill West, weakened by
sickness, lost by a decision. Bill Me!-
ton, a freshman, did a good, solid
job at 150, pinning his U.N.C. op-
ponent. The Generals lost the match

For Those Interested Skiers...

Another Word About
Student Ski Cards

There have been an_ incredibic
amount of inquiries about possible
ski discounts for W&L students.
The advantage cannot be found here
in Virginia but only in ‘the North
and West. In those places one may
obtain a dollar discount on lift tic-
ket’s and up to twenty per cent off
on equipment. The cards are avail-
able to faculty and student's wives.

A magazine is sent out once a
month, and it is concerned mostly
with skiing on a small budget.

The card sells for $4.00 and can
be obtained at the following address’

at 158 pounds, with Jim Stieff los-
ing by a decision, Though the Gen-
erals were planning to forfeit the
167 slot, they changed their minds
and put in their assistant coach,
Bruce Hankins. Wrestling in a class
12 pounds above him, Bruce was
pinned. Bard Wrisley and Dee Cop-
enhaver, also struck with sickness,
‘both lost by a decision. Att this point,
the Generals were winning 20-17,
but, in the next match, U.N.C. was
able to snatch away the victory by
pinning Jay Fulcher at heavyweight

The meet was a close one, and
had the W&L team not been plagued
by sickness, it could have easily
been victorious. In fact, one player
ssoribed the team as a “walking
infinmary,” losing to disease rather
than U.N.C. But despite this handi-
cap, the Generals still made two
pins.

An essential element of the Wash-
ington and Lee wrestling team has
been the freshmen, who make up
over a third of the varsity roster.
Outstanding freshmen include Bill
Melton, who pinned his opponent
in the U.N.C. meet, Bruce Hyatt,
and Jim Stieff. Jim had his best
match so far against the Universiiy
of Virginia, where, though he los
by a decision, he wrestled a fine
match,

Another essential element of the
team, Which cannot go unnoticed, ‘s
the coaching, which law student
Larry Cohen has taken on. He’s
done a fine job.

On Tuesday, January 19th, Wash-
ington and Lee visits the Virginia
Military Institute to take on the
Cadets, who should offer stiff com-
petition, After that, the Generals
wrestle Eastern Mennonite here.
Coach Cohen, for the past few
weeks, has been carrying around a
vietory cigar to be lit when the Gen-
erals win their second victory. Per-
haps he will be able to take it out of
his pocket and light it soon.

ing 8 big points in the final three
minutes of the game. This contest
found the Generals shooting a meas
ly 36%. The success of the press was
reflected in the turnover statistics—
the Boys in Blue turned the ball over
only 10 times, while M.LT. lost pos-
session 21 times. Captain Mike Dan
iel had a good effort, good enough
for all-tournament choice. The Gen-
erals were out rebounded in both
contests.

Wednesday, Coach Canfield’s
Corps travels to Annapolis, to face
the Naval Academy. Air time is set
for 4 o'clock on WLUR-FM. This
weekend the team will be at home
for two big ball games. The oppon-
ents will be Bryant and St. Paul's.
St. Paul is a quick run and shoot
team. Bryant is also an exciting
squad. They have been one of the

? ~ *

best small college teams in the couti-
try for the last three years. Coach
Canfield has labeled the next two
weeks as the most crucial of the sea-
son. The Generals will be ready.
Support them. Everyone can be an
athletic supporter.

Toole, Luce, Weinglass Launch
Symposium With Lecture, Debate

(Continued from Page 2)

to a political end, he pointed out, for
this generation to really exert its
power. Power, and its intelligent use
was really the key to his talk. He
mentioned Nader as a good example
of the ues of statutory powers. In-
deed he feels that this generation hs
to learn how to use power and that
takes time. He emphasized the neces-
sity for “tenacity and courage” and
his blueprint for the proper etuce
tion of a viable and powerful gen-
eration of reformers was to “I, boxe
a look at America’s past, 2. lhat
this country cannot start over, 2,
That a revolution eats its own chil-
dren, and 4, Not to be naive” for we
are fighting great power. He empha-
sized the need for “perservance”
and “resiliency” and that we must
keep pounding at the problems.
While all this is probably true one
cannot overlook two very important
things. First of all Dr. Toole dese ib-
ed student revolutionaries as ‘sick’.
What Dr. Toole failed to realize was
that American society has created
these “sick” revolutionaries. All of
us then must take some responsibil-
ity for these “sick” people. Certainly
the futility of revolutionary ac.
must be evident and therefore it ts
indigent upon the society to provide
viable outlets for these energies. The
futility in the constant struggle for
reform is often hard or impossilie to
overcome. One wonders why Dr.
Toole never addressed himseif to
this very pressing problem. Incecd
when exposed to one student's bad-
gering Dr. Toole sluffed it off there-
by creating a perfect exampic of
why we have “sick” revolutionaries.
Indeed this student's action was a
fine example of an empty and futile
act that meant nothing, but must
have affected that student. This stu
demt must also however be chastized.
His discourtesy was regretable and
he managed to embarrass himself
and the entire audience. It is unfor-
tunate that he felt this way. I must
also say that as I entered I heard
this very student say that he was go-
ing to leave his hat on as a sign cf
disrespect; this before he even heard
what Dr. Toole had to say. Even
after Dr. Toole explained his ‘e'‘ter
this student still felt it importaat
enough to make a scene that, in its
finality, was an empty and meaning-
less act. One can only try and under-

 

THE RING-TUM PHI

stand the reasons for this action if
the student felt he was doing some-
thing important. If he was doing it
for kicks he becomes pathetic.

To change this society it is going
to take a lot of hard work and pati-
nee. Empty act, of which we had a
good example Monday night, will do
little to create change. It will how-
ever create a climate where change
becomes more difficult. Dr. Toole
may well be right about student rev-
olutionaries in that their blueprint
for change may be more damaging
than beneficial, But that does not
mean that we should disregard them.
Jz should however try to lisien.
angue with, and convince them that
they are wrong.

if such a strike comes | ask you
to think before you decide to plunge
into it. Reflect on last May, on your
own personal fervor back then, and
also on what you have done to help
the world around you since then. If
you are one of those people who got
all fired up when the strike came
and have done little with that zeal
since then, I think you should ask
yourself what the hell that liber
tarian period eight months ago was
all about, and maybe also ask your
self what the hell you are all adout?

munity. And if one wished so sin-
cerely to remove any organ of the
“imperialistic Amerikan” govern-
ment, one might begin by calling fo:
an end to government aid to Wash-
ington and Lee; government aid is
much more far-reaching in its ef-
fects upon the student body than ‘s
the Military Science Department.

The Military Science Department
is entitled to give courses for credit
as is any other department. One may
protest ROTC by not enrolling for
courses in ROTC; the choice is the
student’s. One need not drag the
whole University into a political—-
and personal—decision.

Tebo Praises Novel

(Continued from page 3)

“Love Story” is something refresh-
ing, something apart from the usual
in our lives today, something nice
for a change.

I see Baroody as a heartless mion-
ster when he claims that “There is
nothing tragic or cosmic in the anti-
septic death of Jenny.” Jenny is
only a character of fiction, but can
there not be love and feeling for an
idea? I also feel that the term “cos-
mic” is not at all applicable in this
situation.

Baroody speaks of “Love Story”
asa “dead end tearjerker” and as a
“mindless little diversion.” I fully
disagree with this statement. Segal’s
aim was to entertain us—to create
something we could enjoy—scume-
thing meaningful. As complex ss ‘he
world is today, people need some
simple diversions.

As ugly as life often is now we
need something beautiful. As culd
and heartless as people are today,
what we need is love. “Love Story”
is something peaceful, something
lovely, something bloodless for a
change. 1 agree—the thoughts and
ideas expressed by Segal in “Love
Story” are not revolutionary, deep
or “cosmic.” But I believe they were

Dr. Pusey plans to teach several

As to the achievement in the Col-

Pusey said, “I'm glad that the quality
of the faculty has been maintained
and even improved, ... and I'm
gratified by the fine work that has
been done by those we appointed to
committee and department heads.”
He added that “although the size of
the student body has increased, the
doors have remained open.”

“I must say that the credit for the
accomplishments in the College
