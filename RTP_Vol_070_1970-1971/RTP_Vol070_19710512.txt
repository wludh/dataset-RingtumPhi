E.C. Selects New Leadership
For ’72 Mock Convention

The Executive Committee in
closed session Monday evening ap-
pointed junior Tom Gillespie and
law student Mike Campulongo as
permanent co-chairmen of the 1972
Mock Convention. They replace
Dan Silverberg, who has been serv-
ing as interim chairman this year.

Gillespie has been in charge of
campus affairs and state delegations
for the convention, and he will con-
tinue in that capacity as co-chair-
man. Campulongo will handle the
arrangements beyond this campus,
specifically coordination with na-
tional Democratic party politics.

According to President of the Stu-
dent Body, Fran Lawrence, Silver-
berg had a teaching assignment in
California during the present spring

Reynolds Price
In Residence

One of the premier Southern
novelists of our time, Reynolds
Price, has commenced a two-week
residency on campus, under the au-
spices of the Arthur and Margaret
Glasgow Endowment program. His
visit highlights this year’s “spring
events in the arts,” the structural
theme of which is “Words and
Music”.

Mr. Price, who was awarded the
William Faulkner Prize for the best
novel of 1962, arrived in Lexington
early this week. He will deliver a
formal lecture in DuPont Auditor-
ium at 8:15 p.m. on Monday, May
7, In addition, the author will be
available for several seminars and
for student consultation.

The emphasis of this year’s Glas-
vow program is on student participa-
tion. Students who have mamuscripts
and would like them to be read by
Mr. Price are urged to hand them in
to Mr. James Boatwright of the Eng-
lish department as soon as possible.

Conferences may then be arranged

with Price for discussion and criti-
cism.

During his stay at W&L, the au-
thor will participate in several for-
wms on the arts and creative writing.
Phere will be an open seminar on
the techniques of fiction on Wednes-
day, May 19 at 3:30 pam. The Jour-
nalism film seminar will host Mr.
Price next Tuesday morning; this,
ioo, will be open to any interested
persons.

Price, a native of North Carolina,
graduated from Duke University and
studied in Britain for three years as
a Rhodes Scholar. He is presently
an associate professor at Duke, and
he has served as writer-in-residence
at the Universities of Kansas and
North Carolina,

Last Monday evening, Price offer-
ed a reading from several of his
among them “A Long and
Happy Life” (1962), “A Generous
Man” (1966), and “Love and Work”
(1968). His prose is vivid and mov-
ing, with moments of poignant inti-
macy most readily demonstrated
Monday evening by his readings
from a recent collection of short
“Permanent Errors”.

Critic and poet Allen Tate has
lauded Price as “the most original
Southern writer to appear in this de-
cade, and the most sensitive prose
stylist of his generation.”

vention chairman “needed to be on
campus during the summer preced-
ing the Convention.” He also re-
marked that the E.C. had certain
“misunderstandings” with Silverberg
concerning plans for the enterprise.

Lawrence added that the chairman
of the 1968 convention, Steve Saun-
ders, will be visiting Lexington in
the near future for consultation with
this year’s Mock Convention leader-
ship. “With some hard work from
those involved, we'll have no worry,”
said Lawrence. “The real push will
come during the summer” when im-
portant preliminary arrangements
must be made.

‘He asserted that, on the basis of his
committee’s experience with bounced
checks this year, that some stricter
measure should be taken against
“chronic offenders,” those up for
their third violation or more. Harkey
suggested either the E.C. discipline
directly these students, or that the
Student Financial Relations Commit-
tee be authorized to write the stu-
dent’s home bank to recommend the
closing of his account.

“As long as it is understood that
discretion would be used, I think
this is a good idea,” commented Sta-
man Ogilvie. He emphasized that
care must be taken in the wording of
such letters addressed to home banks
and that such a strong measure
would be used only in the case of a
knowing, multiple offender.

The EC then passed a resolution
giving authority to the Financial Re-
lations committee for “more strin-
gent measures” to curb cold checks.

Matt Cole proposed that Contact
funds normally collected in the regi-
stration line be inchided next year
in the student tax. He also sought in-
vestment of $1000 into the reserve

seen financial dilemma.

Joe Tompkins added that plans
had been made to incorporate $3.00
per student for Contact in the $200
tuition rise coming next year. A
motion was passed establishing these

THE RING-TUM PHI

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
May 12, 1971

 

“Fundamental to all other aspirations of Washington and
Lee University are...the pursuit of its educational purpose
in a climate of learning that stresses the importance of the
individual, his personal honor and integrity...”
From the University’s formal statement of
institutional philosophy
“The members of each residential unit of 40 to 50 students
will reach a consensus on the standards of social responsibility
which they will abide by during the academic year... As part
of its statement of social responsibility, each residential unit
may establish social hours within the following guidelines:
5:00 p.m. Friday to 12:00 Midnight Sunday (with the under-
standing that overnight visitations are prohibited).”
From Dormitory Regulations 1970-71

Girls spend the night in the dormitories. It must seem hard
to believe but it is true. That is correct, girls (that is plural)
have actually made “overnight visitations” in Washington and
Lee’s dormitories.

A dormitory counselor made this startling revelation to
The Ring-tum Phi. He had substantial proof that this year
women had been in the dorms for an entire evening, directly
affronting the rule stated above.

Why have the culprits, who permitted females to sleep
in their residences, been allowed to remain unscathed? The
answer is that nobody turned the villains in to the the proper
authorities such as the Student Affairs Committee or Student
Control Committee.

Perhaps a more appropriate question is—why is it that
no one collared these individuals and submitted them to
punishment? It seems that students view the parietals as
something “for the parents and alumni.” An upperclassman
summed up the situation this way: “the parietals are on the
books for appearance, not enforcement.”

That being the case, we should pose another question—
why should such rules exist at all? They are not enforced,
respected or seemingly needed.

We are told that Washington and Lee aspires to the
purposes of individualism, honor and integrity. But the school
requires freshmen to reside in the university maintained dorms.
Granted the life in these dorms is subject to self-regulation
to a limited degree. But these limitations dominate female
visitation hours.

It is unfair to ask a student to become an unreasonable
informer on his fellow students. The dormitory dwellers have
always been confronted with this issue. Turning to a parallel
problem, the W&L men drank in the dorms for years. The
guys down the hall largely ignored drinking in the dorms and
eventually drinking was allowed officially, or at least it was
not banned.

Girls have stayed in the dorms, are staying in the dorms
and probably will stay in the dorms. The rules do not erase
these realities. Parietals accomplish little except putting a
student under the threat of reprisals.

It must be admitted that the university should retain some
control over the dormitory life. The actual facilities belong
to the school and the school must bear the cost of maintain-
ing and repairing those facilities. For that reason the uni-
versity can and does charge for damage to the dormitories.

Also it can be argued that common decency should prevail
in the dormitories. Problems would arise if girls were allowed
throughout the dormitories without restriction, Therefore,
W&L can justify rules that stipulate gentlemanly conduct
and respect for the right of others.

However, justification seems to be lacking for keeping
women out of the dorms during the week or forbiding them
to remain overnight. Washington and Lee espouses integrity
and honor among its students. If students were allowed to
establish their own standards for social conduct in the dormi-
tories, a significant step would be taken toward encouraging
student integrity and honor.

sob Carrere has introduced discussion in the University
Council concerning parietals. We appeal to this council to
re-examine and re-evaluate the merits and faults of parietals.
If need be, this body can carry out a remedy to this problem
under its authority concerning student affairs. Parietals can
be eliminated if the University Council acts,

Unless the parietal regulation can be justified by Wash-
ington and Lee University in the spirit of its above stated
purposes, the parietals should not be allowed to exist,

Whitehead Explains Bud. get

The year 1971 has been a period
of economic uncertainty, evidenced
iby the fact many businesses have fall-
en into bad financial straits. Institu-
tions of higher education are not im-
mune to such problems. Washington
and Lee must pay its bills like any
other business. This article will at-
tempt to examine how well W&L has
done in its attempt to stay in the
black.

In the 1960-1961 fiscal year the
university maintained an expense
ibudget of $2,186,000. Today, just a
decade later, that expense budget has
increased to $5,452,000. Evidently,
running a school has ‘become a more
and more expensive undertaking.

James W. Whitehead, University
Treasurer, analyzed the financial
status of W&L for The Ring-tum
Phi. Whitehead elaborated on the
five million dollar operational bud-
get for this year. He explained that
this figure includes only operational
costs, and excluded capital expenses
such as the expansion of Doremus
Gymnasium.

Fifty-four per cent of the expenses
in the budget are classified as in-
structional. Included in this category
are salaries of the faculty and edu-
cational expenses, Twenty-seven per-
cent of this year’s budget is allotted
to student and public services, which
would encompass the funds needed
for scholarships, the dining hall, the
University Center, and infinmary.
‘Plant operation and maintenance
utilized ten per cent of the W&L
budget. Administration totaled five
percent of operational expenses.

Most colleges and universities are
faced with monetary problems.
Whitehead added that, “a general
trend has emerged across the nation
for colleges. There is an annual in-
crease of about ten per cent in ex-
penses.”

Tuition at W&L gives about half
of the money needed to operate the
services at the school. However, tui-
tion is scheduled to rise over the
next two years. This is not a strange
phenomenon, most private institu-
tions have been forced to do the

The honor system is dead. It has
‘been dead for a long time but pres-
ently hangs over us as yet unburied.
The time has come to bury the past,
recognize the present and plan for
the future. Our system is a primitive
and tribalistic concept surrounded
by an intensely bureaucratic and
complexly diverse world. It has one
rule which is incredibly vague and
subject to a panorama of interpreta-
tions and understandings. It exists on
the assumption that a Washington
and Lee student will not lie, cheat
or steal. This is merely the top-coat
of the assumption behind the system.
Another is that there exists some

colleges in the exchange program
have a higher tuition. Only David-
son, Hampden-Sydney, and Ran-
dolph-Macon charge their students
less. For the 1970-1971 year W&L
tuition was less than the tuition at
such schools as: Amherst, Bowdoin,
‘Brown, Dartmouth, Duke, Emory,
Franklin & Marshall, Hamilton,
‘Harvard, Haverford, Hobart, Ken-
yon, Lafayette, Princeton, Trinity
(Conn.), Union, Wabash, Washing-
ton & Jefferson, Wesleyan and Wil-
liams.

Whitehead continued, “most in-

t

stitutions have found a limit to the
amount that can ‘be charged for
tuition. It does not make them com-
petitive to charge high tuition. Once
you raise tuition you must raise
more money for financial aid or
you will lose some students. We
think our tuition is low enough to
be competitive.”

In summary of Washington and
Lee's financial status Treasurer
Whitehead stated, “We are operat-
ing on a balanced budget. We have
for the previous years and expect to
do the same in the future. This

“Says

 

means if income went down some
exipenses would have to be cut.”

“We are financially ‘sound’ ”,
Whitehead summarized. “Our stab-
ility of income is what keeps W&L
financially sound. This stable in-
come has included tuition, endow-
ment, gifts, and grants.”

Washington and Lee seems to be
doing better than many schools in
recent years in financial matters. At
least W&L can make the claim that
it is Operating in the black, a claim
that makes quite a few college treas-
urers jealous,

Schatz Replies

To the Editors:

The Washington and Lee Univer-
sity community benefits from the
fact that their chronicle of events,
The Ring-tum Phi is only issued once
a week. In that way, the student
populace is misled less frequently
than if the paper were issued on a
daily basis.

As 4 newspaper, you have an un-
questionable obligation to report the
facts—not some of the facts, but
ALL of them.

I cannot and would not speak for
any other member of the University
Council who was absent from our
last meeting. I can only inform The
Ring-tum Phi as to what it should
have taken the trouble to find out
for itself in regard to my absence: |
was representing your university at
my own expense alt the annual
American Society of International
Law convention, in Washington. In
fact, it was almost as boring as your

newspaper.
Robert B. B. Schatz
Law ‘72

The Ring-tum Phi did attempt to dis-
cover Mr. Schatz’ whereabouts dur-
ing the last University Council
meeting. Council Chairman Steve
Robinson informed us that no one
knew why he was not there or where

he was. It seems if this representative
was going to undertake this trip he
could have at least told the chair-
man in advance that he would be ab-
sent. In addition if Mr. Schatz feels
an obligation to continue such ex-
cursions and consequently be absent
from the council meeting, he cannot
effectively carry out his office. How-
ever, we give Mr. Schatz the benefit
of the doubt and withhold final
judgment, We will gauge his earnest
interest in the University Council by
his attendance at the remaining
meetings. Ed,

Woodley Comments

Dear Sir:

Mr. Hinely’s acceptance in his re-
cent article of Jerry Rubin's absurd
equation of Soviet Russia, the vilest
and most obscene regime ever to
crush the humanity from a whole
people, and the Roman Catholic
Church, the instrument responsible
for what civilization and progress oc-
curred in the Western world for a
period of some ten centuries, seems
to be indicative of the extent to
which generalizations based upon
vague notions of historical trends
and events can work to capture com-
pletely the imagination of an other-
wise quite reasonable mind.

The concept of an Utopia is, ad-
mittedly, a very compelling one. The
idea, however, that an abandonment
of all vestiges of selfishness would
result in such a society makes as
sumptions as to the nature of human
existence which are not only unde-

Generals Seek Tourney

Washington and Lee’s Generals
travelled to Charlottesville this after-
noon to face the top-ranked Univer-
sity of Virginia in one of the crucial
national lacrosse games of the 1971
season. Each team has lost only once

and the Cavaliers are unbeaten
against college foes.
This afternoon's encounter will

go a long way toward establishing
Washington and Lee’s position con-
cerning the eight team national tour-
nament that will be held this year
for the first time. Five teams, Vir-

Brown were named Monday to com-

among about half a dozen teams
fighting for the remaining three spots
and a strong showing this afternoon
is crucial to the Generals’ cause.
Both of this afternoon's contes-
tants come off exciting games this
weekend. Virginia pulled out a one
goal victory over Maryland, and
with it the ACC championship, on a
long-shot goal by their goalie with
only seconds to play. Washington
and Lee was devastating in romping
over Loyola of Maryland, 17 to 1.
The Generals scored first against

   
 

Loyola, 57 seconds into the game,
on a goal by Sam Englehart. All-
American Whit Morrill scored less
than a minute later for a 2-0 lead,
and from then on W&L completely
dominated everything.

Washington and Lee fired 72 shots
at the goal during the course of the
afternoon, and the Generals’ attack
men raced quickly through a lagging
Loyola defense. The W&L face-off
play was also especially strong.

By halftime, the score had mount-
ed to 11-0 on three more goals by
Englehart, two by Jim MoCane, and
one each by Scott Neese, Chip

Szlasa Expects

‘Tough Games’

The following are excerpts from
an interview yesterday between The
Ring-tum Phi and W&L lacrosse
coach Dick Szlasa.

“The final three places for the
NOAA tournament will be decided
Sunday evening. Our game against
Virginia and Hofstra’s game with
Virginia on Saturday will probably
decide one of the places.

“We've got another tough game
coming up Saturday against Duke
which has a very fine team. I almost
wish the games (Duke and Virginia)
were reversed.

“I think we're in a better position
to play Virginia than ever before.
We've got good middies, lots of
depth, enthusiasm and most impor-
tant: unselfishness. Virginia’s big ad-
vantage is that they've got a lot more
speed than we do.

“We've come a long way this year.
I’m surprised at the team’s success. I
thought we were still a year away,
‘but we have a lot of enthusiasm and
it’s been a real team effort. Then,
too, we have three seniors (All-
Americans Bill Brumback and Whit
Morrill and All-Division Bill Inger-
soll) who are having their ‘best sea-
son ever.”

Berth

Tompkins, Bill Brumback and John
Lalley.

Frequent substitutions in the sec-
ond half failed to halt the Generals’
attack. Tompkins, Neese, Bill Rien-
hoff, Jim Farrar, and Jim Stieff, all
scored to make the tally an absurd
16-0 before Loyola broke up the
shutout in the fourth period.

Freshman standout Skip Lichtfuss’
goal in the final minute capped the
Generals victory.

This Saturday at 2:00, the stick-
men close out the regular season in
a crucial Wilson Field encounter
against Duke.

Don't ask what happened at the
College Athletic Conference tourna-
ment over the weekend. It was a dis-
aster for Washington and Lee from
the start.

One look at the airplane and we
knew we were headed downhill.
First, pitcher Bill Greener, who
would never think of being late,
missed the bus to Roanoke and got a
ride to the airport. And that YS 11A
we flew with two stops in Louisville,
and get this, London-Corbin, Ken-
tucky, was vintage 1945. We used
up so many air sickness bags that the
stewardess had to get some more on
the second stop. I personally used
three.

Things weren't any better once we
got to St. Louis, as our charter land-
ed amid hailstones and a tornado
alert. We hustled for the Colony
Motor Court, one of the few high
spots of the trip, after receiving a
conflicting set of directions. Rain
forced the cancellation of most acti-
vities until Friday afternoon, but
the damage had been done, as the
golf was halved to eighteen holes
and the baseball games were short-
ened to five innings, three of which
had to be played back to back.

That’s not to excuse W&L’s show-
ing, which was poor on the whole.
The track team was outclassed, but
the real crime was committed by
the baseball team. We were the best
team there, but we didn’t play like it.
After that heart-breaking, 1-0 loss to
Washington in the ninth inning, the
Generals went home. I don't know
how well we looked in tennis, but I
hear it was bad. Only golf, which

And just a few side notes from
the CAC ... Half of the baseball
games were played in the outfield of
WU’s bball diamond, with a tempor-
ary mound constructed and anything
hit on the ground into right field was
a groundrule single . . . The CAC
received a jolt with Washington’s
withdrawal from conference basket-
ball competition, one of the “major”
conference sports. And rumor has it
that an even bigger shake-up is on
the way with some of the other
schools . . . Nobody should com-

plain about the umpires, at least not

in baseball. The crew that worked
the ball games was the best ever in

Columnist McMillan Condemns
Present W&L Honor System

(Continued from page 2)

men decide they have violated the
community sense of honor. A sense
of honor which is never defined. The
absurdity and inequity inherent in
this seems to be shamefully evident.
How can we judge people for trans-
gressions of which they are never
previously informed?

Not only is the concept behind the
system unrealistic and unworkable,
the mechanics of a trial are incred-
ibly unfair to the accused. He is
snatched up in stealth and carted off
to extensive and intensive grilling
by the Executive Committee. He
does not have time to prepare a de-
fense, does not have the (benefit of
counsel in general answers to
the impromptu procedural decisions
of the Exeoutive Committee. All this
is justified ‘by calling the proceedings
an inquiry not an adversary pro-
ceeding. However, at the end of this
“inquiry” the student involved may
find himself convicted and on the rail
out of town. The manipulations
which the Executive Committee
makes can be easily done since there
is no clearcut structure here as in
the rest of the system.

As much as the bureaucracy in

which we live awes, intimidates and

disgusts many, it is nevertheless a
very real part of our American soc-
iety. If there is one very concrete
thing which all students hold in
common, it is their lifelong exposure
to a society of bureaucracy. We are
all acoustomed to asking for a rule
ibook and getting it. Personal judg-
ment is a fine and necessary aspect
of a bureaucracy but no bureaucratic
society can exist on this alone, This
is what we have been trying to do.
It will not work and it does not
work.

We need to codify the honor sys-
tem. As it now stands individuals
face an increasingly unfair and un-
predictable future. To deny the nec-
essity of this seems to be a refusal
to face the nature of our system. It
is a plunge backwards into primitive
tribalism in which the “elders” arbi-
trarily decide the fate of a tribe
member who has not been raised in
the mores and laws of the tribe. If
we all grew up together here on this
campus and had been ingrained from
childhood with the yea’s and nay’s
of the tribe, then perhaps our sys-
tem could be justified. As it now
stands, our systems is very like what
would happen if a vast number of
tribes contributed a few individuals
to create a new tribe and only one
of the contributing tribes customs
was acknowledged and all others
were taboo and punishable by exile.

We are being bound and smother-
ed by a system created by men of the
past who lived in another world. We
sacrifice people to a system which
we dare not change as if some aura
of holiness pervaded it. As we stand
in Obedient awe and resist change.
individuals are ‘being dealt with un-
justly and receiving scars which can
affect their entire lives. It is time to
change and we must act now. This
is a matter which does not merit
procrastination nor can our com-
munity afford it.

Woodley Comments
(Continued from page 2)

monstrable ‘but patently ridiculous.
Mr. Hinely is correct in his analysis
of the selfish basis for anti-welfare
philosophy. Why, why, why should
my energy ‘be directed to the preser-
vation of another's state of life, if I
don’t want it to be?

Disregarding the parenthetical,
and pathetic, assertion that national
boundaries are meaningless because
of radio and TV, we come to the
greatest piece of philosophical gym-
nastics of all. It goes like this: Men
must ‘become unselfish, subordinate
there goes, and subjugate themselves
to a communist system which will
redistribute what they own and what
they create, in order to truly become
individuals and find themselves “tops
in their field, because we are all diff-
erent.”

Finally, there is Mr. Hinely’s at-
tack on what he called the “rat race.”
Put simply, it refers to any attempt
to raise the conditions and enjoy-
ment of life ‘by increasing one’s in-
come through advancement. Personal
wealth, as well as all the joys, pleas-
ures, and conveniences that go with
it, is selfish, Mr. Hinely says, and
therefore evil. There is also the
somewhat paranoid and totally un-
supportable assertion that individual
striving to better conditions of life
will cause atomic holocaust or en-
vironmental catastrophe. Frankly, |
am not afraid of Mr. Hinely’s “rat
race.” The only reasons I can ima-
gine for being frightened are incom-
petence, indolence, or paranoia.

To attack someone for his beliefs
is a practice which is as dangerous as
it is counter-productive. However,
the careful consideration of attacks
on the beliefs themselves can only
result in a better understanding of
their nature. The concept of an Uto-
pia based on selflessness is, quite
simply, without ‘basis in reality.

John Paul Woodley, ‘74

LETTERS TQ THE EDITOR

Seeks Courtesy

Editor:

I have recently written my 100th
letter of recommendation this Spring.
In order to keep going in an effec-
tive sort of way, I would like to sug-
gest that those students who apply to
Law Schools and Graduate Schools
and who are accepted but choose not
to go, show the common courtesy to
write and thank the Admissions
Dean for having been accepted.

Every now and then I run into an
Admissions Dean who says: “Milton,
remember that student you recom-
mended to us... you know the one
you said was “alert, intellectually
curious, and a man of unfailing
courtesy, well we accepted him and
we never got an answer...

Gentlemen, get out your pen and
paper.

for one couple to all concerts, will
ibe offered to all students for $40.
“We are also confident that we will
be able to use the facilities of the
new gym, which has seating for
3600.” added Meem. “This will yield
us, therefore, more revenue at the
door.”

Meem said that the Dance Board
had explored the possibility of com-
ibining resources with either V.M.1.
or with one of the girls’ schools and
found this to be infeasible. Tickets at
the door for each concert, however,
will be available to any person at
