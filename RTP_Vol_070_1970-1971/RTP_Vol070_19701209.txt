On Independent Exams

BY STAMAN OGILVIE

Assuming you have given a dated
exam envelope to each of your pro-
fessors, (If not, (1) lay down this
paper, (2) call your profs, (3) beg
clemency) you have two duties for
the next eight days. First, appear at
the appointed times to demonstrate
your competence in your curricula,
and secondly, curb your tongue,

The administrative foundation up-
on which this independent system is
‘based requires that each exam be
taken at the pre-arranged time. You
may not receive your exam at any
other time than the period for which
you registered. Have an accurate re-
cord of what exam is to be taken
when and present yourself at the
prescribed time and place.

The philosophical foundation of
this exam arrangement demands that
the contents of each exam be yours
to ruminate, enjoy, curse, but not
discuss. Disclosure of particulars or
any reference to makeup or degree
of difficulty of any exam jeopardizes
the legitimacy of test scores. Dis
cussion of any aspect of previously
taken exams with anyone except
your professor until after noon, De-
cember 17 must be dealt with as a
breach of the Honor System.

Independent exams have been a
long time coming. Students have
sought for years, relief from the con-
straints of arbitrarily assigned test
schedules. For two years self-sched-
uled exams have been pursued thro-
ugh legislative channels at W&L.

The faculty, in January 1969, re-
jected a student-initiated indepen-
dent exam proposal (after its recom-
mendation by the Student Body Exe-
cutive Committee and the Faculty
Committee on Council and Degree).
Their complaints: (1) with the then
current ten day exam period most
people already had reasonable sched-
ules; (2) the difficulty of admini-
stering an independent schedule out-
weighed its benefits in flexibility; (3)
the arrangement could unnecessarily
burden the Honor System. Discus-
sion ended, subject closed.

Until, God bless them, the new
curriculum and the calendar ren
dered the neatly arranged ten day
set-up too long and any shortene*
offspring too complicated.

So with the new academic dawn
came a free-scheduling exam week.
Skeptics decry the flexibility of an
independence to take four or five
exams in five test days. But, brothers
and seven sisters, the alternative
plans allowed the possibility of three
exams in one day. With this enlight-
ened perspective, oh, careworn and
study4aden, rejoice in your freedom
but in your rejoicing accept the new
duties and shut the hell up.

Faculty Approves University
Council and Honors Program

A “University Council” with 13
student members and 17 from the
faculty and administration was ap-
proved Monday by the faculty.

The Council will serve as an ad-
visory agency offering recommenda-
tions and suggestions regarding re-
ports prepared for submission to
general faculty meetings by other
official committees.

In addition, it is designed to serve
“as a forwm for the exchange of
ideas on critical issues pending be-
fore the community.”

The faculty, in its regular Decum-
ber meeting, also delegated to the
newly created University Council
authority in non-academic, non-cur-
ricular student affairs. The new

council will exercise the faculty's re-
sponsibility for student and frater-
nity conduct, dormitory rules and
regulations and will aid both in plan-
ning freshman orientation and in ad-
ministering the faculty advisor sys-
tem.

Each standing faculty committee
will pass its reports through the new
council before sending them to the
faculty itself. Thowgh the Counc:'
will have no power to amend or veto
other committee proposals and reg-
ulations, it will be expected to com-
ment on them.

The Council will also serve to in-
itiate proposals to the faculty, ad-
ministration and student body as
well.

EC Studies
Selection of
New Council

There was certainly no Christmas
rush on business in Monday's Exe-
cutive Committee meeting. Only two
major topics were discussed — the
University Council and the “drug
problem” at Washington and Lee.

President Fran Lawrence announc-
ed that the University Council pro-
posal had passed a faculty vote by a
5 to | margin. The announcement
produced a brief flurry of excite-
ment; as one EC member put it: “All
right! The school is ours!” The pro
gram is scheduled for implementa-
tion in early February. A motion to
refer election procedure details to

the Constitutional Subcommitice
passed unanimously, Glenn Azuma
promised a report at the second
January meeting

A committee of Jim Slay, Rich

Murray, Bob Johnson, and President
Lawrence was appointed to stud:
WAL's “drug problem” with pur
pose in mind to offer suggestions to
the newly formed Rockbridge Coun

Designed jointly by committees
of the faculty and the student gov-
ernment, the University Council will
permit student participation in po!-
icy-making decisions at the Univer-
sity, according to Dr. William J.
Watt, associate dean of the College
and chairman of the faculty's exe-
cutive committee, which presented
the proposal at Monday's meeting.

The student members of the
Council will have full voting privi-
leges and will be treated exactly as
the faculty and administration mem-
bers of the council, under the fac-
ulty resohution creating it.

Students have previously been
given voting representation on other
standing committees of the faculty,

Newscaster Roger Mudd deliver-
ed the address at the annual Omic-
ron Delta Kappa Assembly in which
12 student leaders were tapped as
new members,

Mudd told the audience that tele-
vision, especially in its news cover-
age, has not lived up to its early
promise.

As a visual medium, he said, TV
has fallen into the easy trap of em-
phasizing happenings rather than
the reasons behind them, action rath-
er than ideas, “emotions rather than
intellect.”

“Inquiry and explanation are es:
sential” in a complete presentation
of the news, Mudd declared, but
television too frequently ignores
them. Because news shows last just
30 minutes, there is no time for ex-
planations, and in their place “face
and violence” become all-important.

Omicron Delta Kappa national
honorary leadership fraternity was
founded at W&L 56 years ago and
Rupert N. Latture, special advisor
to President Huntley, was an honor-
ed guest at the ceremony.

Mudd, a W&L alumnus, was al-
most an hour late arriving because
his scheduled flight from Washing-
ton was cancelled at the last min-
ute. Huntley, a classmate of Mudd’s
at the university—entertained the
audience of some 700 students, fac-
ulty, and other guests with an ad-
libbed “program” of anecdotes and
stories.

Named to the national honorary
fraternity for leadership — were
three third-year students in the
School of Law, six undergraduaie
seniors and three juniors.

The law students named to mem-
‘bership are:

Robin P. Hartmann of Arlington.
He is editor-in-chief of the univer-
sity’s Law Review, president of the
Student Bar Association and an argu-
ing member of the university's moot

Selective Service Sets
Reclassification Date

 

December 9, 1970

A Wish,

“The once—

conventional dress .

has been abandoned by a

majority of students. Good
grooming and neatness in dress still
prevail, but exceptions

to these standards

are numerous.”
—The Student Handbook
1970-71

It appears we have entered the “Age of Aquarium.” Wash-
ington and Lee has become au courant in the past few years,
and unfortunately the current of meaningful change has raked
the bottom foundation of our community stirring up the sludge
of sloppy dress prevalent on any cow college campus in the
United States.

One case in point should serve to show why the above
quotation should be deleted from the Handbook.

The basketball game with Randolph-Macon a week ago
Tuesday might as well have been played at College College in
Collegetown, Anywhere, U.S.A. There were the Randolph-
Macon students—small in number—looking like they came
from Randolph-Macon. There were the Washington and Lee
students—overwhelming in number—yet looking like they
came over from Buena Vista to “catch ‘at bawl game.” The
Randolph-Macon students might well have been doubtful as
to where they were—if “W&L” didn’t stand out in blue on
white on the Washington and Lee uniforms.

The tradition of conventional dress was not an intrinsic
value that the students prized above their gentlemanly con-
duct, self respect, and pride. It was, however, a reflection of
those values, a reflection which was an indication that they
cared enough about themselves and their school to dress con-
ventionally. Perhaps they still hold to these values which make
Washington and Lee's community unique among the myriad
of computerized diploma mills in the country, But what other
school would buy that argument? The alumni of 10 years and
back must wonder what has happened to one of the well-
known reputations of their alma mater. And juniors and sen-
iors in high school certainly must be somewhat less impressed
with the outward manifestations of what is claimed in the
University’s introductory literature. The point is this: “times”
may have changed, but since when has the concept of one’s
own personal pride altered?

Perhaps we have not been “with it.” Perhaps the appear-
ance fits the reality and we are indeed in the “Age of Aquar-
ium.” If so, then perhaps students should be required to wear
jeans (with at least one rip in the knee), no socks (except in
designated winter months), no tie, and a shirt (perfectly
wrinkled),

The death of intellectual curiosity and the beginning of
narrow gnosticism is to some extent reflected in the pathetic
fallacy that clothing styles should reflect a style of thought.

A Thought,

While we're on the subject of ideals and realities, we can’t
help thinking that the institution of the new independent ex-
amination schedule is not going to please everyone the first
time around. In fact, if we are any judges of human nature
whatsoever, the first to be against continuation of the inde-
pendent exams will be those who are confused.

In order to ward off any confusion surrounding the inde-
pendent examinations for this term, we have printed on this
page a description of the procedure which is to be followed by
each student during the next week. We find the procedure to be
quite simple and convenient—provided that all students are
aware of the requirements involved.

We imagine there will be more than a handful of miffed
faculty members and students at noon on December 17, but
we hope their cause for disgruntlement will either be the pro-
spect of having to grade 100 or so tests, or the retrospect of
four or five exams that were more difficult than they should
have been,

And A Thoughtful Wish

We aren't able to imagine it, but we are told that there was
a time when W&L students did not receive any vacation holi-
day over Christmas, But we're glad not only for our own
breather from the weekly task of putting the six pages of this
glorious rag together, but for the needed rest this vacation al-
fords several people in the Print Shop who are the real men
behind this newspaper: Messrs, Larry Mason, Hunter MeCoy,
Ed Walker and Wayne Conner.

On behalf of them and ourselves, we wish you the mer-
riest Christmas any W&L students could ever hope to have: a

worry-free and a study-free vacation.

 

A Pictorial Editorial

How many times in one’s life can man realize the true worth of his
place in a larger group? How often is one able to recollect the moments
when he and his fellow men were truly happy with the simple fact of
living together? President Robert E. R. “Rube” Huntley and Mr, Roger
“Boomer” Mudd brought one of these moments to the ODK assembly
Monday. And for about one hour, the essence of Washington and Lee
was in their words and in the laughter of those about them.

Registrants wishing to drop defer-
ments and be reclassified into Class
I-A status to take advantage of a
year-end policy announced last
month by the Selective Service Sys-
tem, have been given until midnighi,
December 31, 1970, to file for the
reclassification. Such requests must
be received by local ‘boards by that
date or carry a postmark dated De-
cember 31, 1970 or earlier.

The announcement is contained in
instructions issued to local board
personnel by Dr. Curtis W. Tarr,
National Director of Selective Serv-
ice. These instructions alter previous
policy which stated that the applica-
tion had to be in the hands of local
board personnel prior to a Decem-
ber meeting of the local board.

In particular, the instruction to
local boards will be of interest lo
men who hold high numbers in the
1970 draft lottery. Should a young
man hold a number higher than that
reached by his local board—and No.
195 has been set as the highest num-
ber which any local board can reach
—-it is to his advantage to voluntar-
ily give up hi sdeferment for a I-A
classification. In these cases, he will
move to a lower draft priority group
on January 1, 1971 with other mem-
bers of the 1970 first priority group
with unreached numbers.

While recognizing that young
men holding lottery numbers over
their local board “high” could ef-
fectively limit their vulnerability to
the draft by being classified into I-A
by the year’s end, Dr. Tarr stated
that “the law allows young men fo
elect whether they will apply for a
deferment and those young men
granted deferments should be able
to drop them if they desire.”

Dr. Tarr said the new policy was
issued because various boards thro-
ughout the country were scheduling
their last meetings of the year at

Take The Time

BY ROBERT BAROODY

Friday night, the 4th of Decem-
ber. A night on the edge of cold:
just enough to cause people to hud
die together, 7:30 p.m. in Lexing-
ton, Virginia, where children stoud
five deep on Main Street; it was time
for the annual Christmas Parade.

fFor those who missed the par-
ade, I feel pity. These flesting
glimpses of our childhood are ex-
ceedingly rare. The entire first half
of our lives seems to have been ob-
literated by the analytic mind of the
second half, So must we savour the
moment's joy.)

it was all there. Look, Debbie
and Sandy, local damsels spirited
past in Ford Galaxies. Look, the
endiess sputter of good and not-so-
good floats. Look, bands, elfin me
joreties, and clowns demanding, : 2
imploring, “Laugh!” And if you
would forget that Santa Claus was a
littie out of it; if you could forget
that many marchers drift away al
the ghetto’s fringe; if you threw
down the weight of cynicism forever
cultivated by Esquire and The Wash
ingion Post. . . then you laughed.

Unfortunately. we remember that
we are collegians. A parade is all of
America’s fantasies and realities on

different times. By defining a specific
cutoff date, the new policy allows all
registrants an equal amount of time
to take advantage of the reclassifica-
tion offer.

Previous to changing this policy
on dropping of deferments, regist-
rants holding deferments were gen-
erally unable to relinquish volun-
tarily them as long as they continued
to meet the criteria for deferment,
except at the end of the defermen:
period when they could cancel them
simply by not submitting the neces-
sary documents for an extension.

Dr. Tarr pointed out that all de-
ferments are issued for limited per-
iods of time, generally for one year,
and that it is the responsibility of
the registrant to submit documenta-
tion for an extension of his defer-
ment. In the absence of documenta-
tion, the new Local Board Memur-
andum instructs local boards to re-
classify promptly registrants into 1-
A. This means that registrants wish-
ing to continue their deferments
should submit the supporting docu-
mentation to their local boards.

Student Center
Survey Reveals
Expansion Need

This past week, the W&L student
body was once again assailed with a
barrage of questionnaires. Hidden
in the paper drifts were occasional
sheets which inquired of their read
ers opinions on subjects such as
their interest in combo parties, film
festivals, bridge tournaments, and
any number of other possible activi-
ties.

Put out by the members of the
University Center-Orientation Com-
mittee, the survey attempted to
gauge student enthusiasm for the
suggestions put forward by the com-
mittee by having participants check
either “Like,” “Dislike,” or “Indif-
ferent” beside the various sugges-
tions.

Approximately 600 of the ques-
tionnaires were filled out during the
course of last Wednesday's classes, a
number which the members of the
committee felt to be large enough to
provide a reasonable barometer of
student sentiment.

From the responses obtained,
members of the University Center-
Orientation Committee feel that
there is a good deal of support for
the University Center's branching
out into other entertainment areas.

Particularly popular were idess
such as the film festival, in which
flicks by the same artist, or with
similar themes, or just of high ap-
peal, will be offered to the student
body: theme parties to take the place
of the standard combo-mixer affair;
expanded versions of “Sem Night;”
an dother activities about which the
committee had either heard interes’
expressed, either from outside or
within the committee.

It is likely that work on imple-
menting these new ideas will begin
soon after the beginning of the win
ter term, in order to give them a fair
trial and judge their popularity with
some degree of experience backing
up the decision.

The very newness of the Univer-
sity Center as a school facility has
meant that new directions of utiliza-
tion have had to be mapped, The di-
rection taken by the University Cen-
ter-Orientation Commitice seems to
be one of seeking to broaden the
uses and benefits to be derived from
the structure,

On The Coming Bowl Games

Now that all the bowl teams have
been chosen, | guess it’s time to play
Pick the Winners. The point spreads
are subject to change without notice
and are provided courtesy of Red-
neck Oddsmakers Inc.

Ohio State takes on Stanford and
Heisman winner Jim Plunkett in
the Rose Bowl, but Woody Hayes’
Buckeyes should win easily by a
touchdown. The quarterbacking of
Rex Kern, the running of John
Brockington, and that swarming
OSU defense will make the differ-
ence.

The Orange Bowl match-up of
Nebraska and LSU features size
versus speed. Despite the way the
Tigers crushed Ole Miss Saturday,
the Cornhuskers will be harder to

contain. The Big Red should skin
the Tigers by five.

Over in Louisiana, Air Force
meets Tennessee for the Sugar Tro-

phy. The Vols are used to the South-

eastern Conference and are my pick
iby ten over the Flyboys from Colo-
rado.

Meanwhile, the eyes of Texas and
most of the nation will be turned to
Dallas, where the number 1 Horns
host Notre Dame in the Cotto
Classic. This one should really be a
good game. Texas’ offense, com-
prised of the run, was nothing short
of awesome in the Big Shootout II
and their defense looked tough
against the ground game. But the
Irish will ‘be in a vengeful mood,
and Joe Theisman’s golden arm
could shoot the Orange right out of
the saddle. My heart’s with the
Horns but my money’s on Notre
Dame by three points.

And just 250 miles south of Dal-
las, the Sooners of Oklahoma, who
rallied for a 7-4 season, will meet
Bear Bryant’s Alabama squad in the
Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl. The Soon-
ers should keep on rallying, beating
the Crimson Tide by eleven.

The Gator Bowl presents Auburn
and recently drubbed Ole Miss, The
Tigers will be too much for the
Rebels, with or without Archie
Manning. Auburn by about a dozen
points. Believe it or not the Sun
Bowl ought to be a pretty good
game, though it won't decide an aw-

from Georgia and Texas, will knock

Generals Control Lynchburg, 73-71

BY PALMER TRICE

“It's a win,” commented round-
ball coach Verne Canfield, after his
Generals slid ‘by the Lynchburg Hor-
nets. The game should have been
closer than the 73-71 score indicates,
but the Generals got off more shots
than the Hornets, both from the
field and from the line. In a post-
game interview, the W&L coach
said that he was disappointed in his
team’s performance. The 1-3-1 zone
half-court press that had worked so
well for the Generals in the first
half, producing five turnovers in a
row at one time, fell apart in the
second half. The Hornets got too
many inside shots, and too many of-
fensive rebounds. Coach Canfield
singled out 5’-11” guard Hatton
Smith for special praise. His four
long jumpers in the second half kept
the Generals in the lead. Mike Dan-
iel, as usual, led the squad, turning
another stellar job. John Glace
pumped in 18 points before he foul-
ed out late in the game.

Last Thursday, the Generals play-
ed their second game of the season,
at home, with the Bridgewater
Eagles. While winning 76-73, the
home team committed 20 turnovers.
John Glace tossed in 21 points, and
Mike Daniel, 18. Considering that it
was only the team’s second outing,
they did well. They shot a blistering
54% from the floor. Defensively,
Daniel and Co. showed 6 different
sets. Among these were the half-
court press, the match, a tight man

for man, and a sagging man for
man. The Generals showed that they
have a strong bench, receiving an
outstanding outing from Skip Licht-
fuss. In the Lynchburg game, W&L
didn’t move enough on defense, but
in this game, they stood around on
offense.

After the Bridgewater game,
Coach Canfield said that the team
lacked experience. This lack was to
prove fatal in the Old Dominion
contest. For the first half, “they
played our ball game.” After that,
the Old Dominion squad ran up
15 straight points, and the Gen-
erals lead no more. The final score
was 84-60, but the Old Dominion
coach Sonny Allen praised the W&L.
roundballers “for making us play
W&L’s game” in the first half. After
intermission, the Monarch’s patent-
ed fast break took control. The

Monarchs proved that they should
be the sixth ranked team in the
country. Pleased with the Blue’s per-
formance, Coach Canfield said that
his team gained a lot, playing an ex-
perienced team such as Old Domi-
nion on their home court.

In the future, look for more of
Hatton Smith. Perhaps he is the
hustle and the outside shooting that
the Generals have been lacking.
Against Hampden-Sydney on Thur .-
day, the Generals will need an out-
standing performance. The Tigers
beat those same Lynchburg Hornets
by a score of 111-95. Prior to their
game with W&L, Lynchburg had
been averaging over 90 points a
game.

Last night, the JayVees upset the
Baby Hornets, 85-79. This pushed
the Brigadeers’ record to 3-0. Last
week, they defeated the Bridgewater

Wrestlers Dumped By Dickinson, 31-11

BY DAVID TORRANCE

The Washington and Lee wrest-
ling team has already had two
matches, and from the looks of
those matches, the season looks pro-
mising for the grapplers. On Decem-
ber 1, the Generals beat Guilford
College by a score of 25 to 14. At
the 134 pound class, Craig Hankin
pinned his man, while Bill West won
by forfeit. At 118 pounds, Pat Bu-
ford tied, but Bart Wrisley pinned
his opponent at 177 pounds. The
only General to win by decision was
Dee Copenhaver, at 190. Jim Hook-
er, wrestling heavyweight, pinned
his adversary.

 

rrr

WELCOME!!

Unfortunately, the match with
Dickinson was not as successful for
the W&L team, which led by a
score of 31 to 11 on Saturday, De-
cember 5. W&L won only three of
the ten matches. Bruce Hyatt, in the
126 pound weight class, won by de-
cision, as did Dee Copenhaver,
wrestling at 190. The only General
to pin an opponent in this match
was Bard Wrisley, who was wrest-
ling heavyweight. Although Craig
Hankins lost, 2 to 0, he did a fine
job on Saturday.

From these two matches hopefully
the Generals have learned a lot.
They had a fine first match, and, in
their second, they learned what it is
like to face a strong team like Dick-
inson. This year, the lineup goes as
follows: Pat Buford at 118, Bruce
Hyatt at 126, Craig Hankins at 134,

Melton switching off at weights 150
to 158, Jack Ross at 167, Jay Ful-

cher or Bar Wrisley at 177, Dee
Copenhaver (the team captain) at
190, and at heavyweight—one of the
two 177 pounders (either Wrisley or
Fulcher). Six of these ten men are
wrestling this year for their first
time. The problem of inexperience
will be remedied as the season pro-
gresses. So far, though, this year’s
season looks much brighter than last
year’s when Washington and Lee
won only one of their nine matches.
On December 8, the Generals fice
a tough team from Duke. If the
grapplers win this, they will have ai-
a bettered their last year’s rec-
ord.

frosh, 87-74. In the Bridgewater con-
test, the Little Generals placed five
men in double figures—Frick and
Montgomery had 15, and Nolan,
Porath, and Smith had 14. The team
shot a tough 47%. In their third vic-
tory, Geoff Nolan led the scoring
with 25 points. Montgomery and
Porath both had 14. It looks like a
banner year for the J.V.s, as the
Lynchburg Freshman averaged 99
points a game in their last two out-
ings, until they met the powerful
Generals.

Faculty Approves Establishment
Of 30-Man University Council

including its executive commitice,
the two disciplinary committees, and
the University’s courses and degrees
committee.

The new council will have no jur-
isdiction over the Honor System.

Ex officio members of the new
council will be the president of the
student ‘body, the deans of the Col-
lege, the School of Commerce, Eco-
nomics and Politics and the School
of Law, the dean of students and the
president of the University.

Twelve faculty members and an
equal number of students will be
elected at large under procedures
which each group will propose at
January’s regular faculty meeting.

The faculty also approved a basic
re-design of the “honors” program
stressing intellectual creativity.

Under the new structure, students
will spend their last two years in
college, rather than simply their
senior year, undertaking honors
work. Included in each department's
honors program will be special inde-
pedent work in which students will
be required to produce a significant
thesis based on field or laboratory
work, a creative accomplishment in
the arts, or a comparable scholarly
undertaking demonstrating “more
than simply a mastery of the subject
matter,” according to the faculty
vote.

That independent work will carry
six to 12 hours’ credit toward grac-
uation — the equivalent of between
two and four normal courses.

The remainder of the honors cur-
riculum in each department will
cover regular course work, special
tutorial, directed reading projects,
seminars, and internships. Compre-
hensive examinations will also be
required.

Students will also be eligible to
undertake honors work in two or
three academic departments jointly.
or under an “independent” honors
major, with the approval of the
deans and faculty committees in-
volved.

The new honors program will go
into effect beginning next autumn.

On successful completion of the
program, a student will be graduated
“with honors”, and his achievement
will be noted on his diploma, in his
formal records and in special recog-
nition at commencement  cere-
monies.

In a third action, the facuity
cleared a program that will allow up
to three Washington and Lee stu-
dents to serve as special interns 9
members of Virginia’s General As-
sembly or legislative committees
during the winter academic term.

The internship program will be
non-partisan and will require the
presence of the three students thro-
ughout the session of the Assembly
which opens at the Capitol next
month,

After serving as research assis-
tants to delegates, state senators or
committees during the session —
which is expected to last six to eight
weeks—the students will spend the
remainder of the winter term oa
campus, completing individual pro-
jects related to their internships.

Participating students will receive
six credits in Politics 385 for the
special program.

While in Richmond, participating
students will live in private homes,
Those accommodations have been
arranged by Richmond civic and
service organizations. They will in-
volve no cost to the students.

To be eligible for designation as
an intern, a student must be at least
three credits or more ahead of his
“normal” schedule in his progress
toward accumulating graduation
credits. He must also have a 2.5
cumulative grade-point average or
higher.
