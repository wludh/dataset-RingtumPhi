On Honor Survey

BY PHIL THOMPSON

I am sure that many students and
members of the Washington and Lee
community have been both curious
and concerned as to the outcome of
the Honor System survey which the
Executive Committee conducted ear-
lier in the academic year. Now that
the results of that survey have been
fully aired by the Executive Com-
mittee, a few comments need to be
set forth in explanation of the rela-
tively lengthy period of deliberation
and in regard to the subsequent find-
ings,

 

For Survey Results,
See Page 2

 

The purpose of the study of the
present Honor System was not to
necessarily implement immediate
change. It was motivated by a desire
to capture the ourrent consensus of
student sentiment toward the Honor
System, if in fact there exists such a
vital force on our campus. The sub-
committee in charge of this survey
worked on the premise than in any
community any system of laws or
values is only as strong as the sulp-
port exhibited for it by the members
of that community. An honor sys-
tem which holds out as sacred cer-
tain values which are of little or no
significance to the general student
‘body is certainly far more distasteful
than no honor system at all.

Perhaps the members of the sub-
committee envisioned themselves as
enlightened practitioners who were
to extract areas of maligancy or
structural weakness from the overall
system. | myself expected to find
strong student sentiment in favor of
greater delineation of the confines of
the system and/or support for pos-
sible codification phus a reflection of
the seeming discontent with the ab-
solute penalty. Yet the student body
once again managed to confound
the EC and perhaps even themselves
on this occasion.

First of all, only 337 students re-
sponded to the questionnaires which
were made available on campus for
an entire week. It would be quite
simplistic and very gratifying to har-
bor the belief that the other three
fourths of the student body are per-
fectly content with our present
Honor System and thus they saw no
need to respond at all, And no one
member of the sub-committee which
drafted the questionnaire has delud-
ed himself by discontinuing the ami-
guity which existed in several of the
questions which accounted for some
degree of abstention, | am sure.

Yet I feel that there are two pro-
per conclusions to be attached to the
returns: 1) The majority of the stu-
dents at Washington and Lee take
the Honor System for granted and
they are perfectly willing to pay lip
service to it, as long as it does not af-
fect them personally or require some
degree of personal action: 2) That a
new trend has exerted itself on
campus whereby each and every in-
dividual feels free to exercise his
own personal code of honor.

Il am quite confident that Wash-

CANDIDATES FOR STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT—Tom Mays
(left) and Steve Robinson, The Candidates will speak tonight in Com-
mons at 7:00,

Election Timetable Set;
EC Debates Referendum

The Executive Committee Mon-
day prepared the way for the upcom-
ing student body elections and also
formulated the make-wp and ballot-
ing procedure for the student delega-
tion to the new University Council,
In other action they also decided to
defer any proposals which might
have arisen from the release of the
Honor System survey last week.

The following candidates present-
ed complete positions for student
body offices: for President of the
Student Body, Tom Mays and Steve
Robinson; for Vice-President, Glenn
Azuma and John Cassell; for Secre-
tary, Jim Davis, Rick Gray, and
Bruce Madison; for Dance Board
Vice-President, Richard Middleton
and Gary Poliakoff; for Fancy Dress
President, Brian Greig and Paul
Suthern.

Speeches by the above candidates
for the “Big Five” positions will be
delivered tonight at 7:00 in Evans
Dining Hall. The E.C, also announc-
ed the following Election schedule:
General Election—March 8, Run-
off—March 11, Class and E.C, elec-
tions Petitions due—March 15, Gen-
eral Election and University Council

etitions due—March 22, and Run-
off plus University Council election
—March 25.

Several questions faced the E.C,
Monday concerning the newly form-
ed University Council, an advisory
and appellate body composed of 12
students and 12 faculty members. (1)
Who is to compose the student sec-
tor of the Council? (2) how will
these studenis be designated? (3)
should the Council be included in
the present Student Body Constitu-
tion?

The menvbers of the E.C. agreed
that the general election would be
preferable to appointment of the

University Council members. Sta-
man Ogilvie added, “I see no reason
why it would be necessary, or even
desirable, that the University Coun-
cil consist of representatives propor-
tional to each class.”

Ogilvie asserted that the Council
should be weighted in favor of the
upperclassmen, since experience and
good relations with faculty will be
of particular importance in the func-
tion of the Council.

Tom Mays pointed out that inter-
est for student positions on the
Council has been keen, and he urged
minimal restriction on running for
these offices. “We must arrive at

Council Seems ‘Promising’

Both students and faculty mem-
bers were encouraged with the Uni-
versity Council meeting. This body
held its initial session last Saturday
morning.

Organizational and procedural
business dominated this meeting.
However, the council decided to
elect co-chairmen, one student and
one teacher. The election of the
chairmen was postponed umil a later
date.

The Council is composed of 30
members, Twelve faculty members
are elected by their peers and 12 stu
dents are elected to the group also.
Six members serve in an ex officio
basis: President of the University,
President of the Student Body, and

Gym Is One-Third Completed

BY JOHN ROBINSON

Construction of Washingion and
Lee's $3 million gymnasium is about
on schedule. This assurance came
this week from D. E. Brady, Super
intendent of Buildings and Grounds
Farris Hotehkiss, Director of Um
versity Development, also assured
us, “I'm confident that the funds can
be raised in time.”

The major remodeling and addi
tion to Doremus Gymnasium is sone
duled to be completed in Septenrber
Several new features are inchided in
the gym's blueprints. A new baske!
ball court and swimming pool are
planned. Also more handball courts
and athletic offices are foreseen in
the new structure

The actual work on the building
has been slightly stalled by the ab
sence of steel erection personne!

However, work scheduled for later

dies in the project has been moved
up to complete the job on time.

“They're about two weeks behind
schedule,” Brady explained, “but the
contractor says he'll be finished on
ime.”

“The roof could have been on by
now, if it weren't for this delay,”
Brady added. “But the delay hasn't
stopped the job, the brick work has
gone on ahead of schedule.”

When questioned about opening
sections of the gym this year, Brady
was pessimistic. “I don't think there
is any possibility that the handball
courts will be ready this year. We
had hoped to have them in use this
winter

A job which parallels the actual
consiruction in difficulty is financing
this entire venture. In charge of that
phase is the Development Office. and
more specifically its director, Parris
Hotohk iss

About $1 million of the needed $1

million has been raised Hotchkiss
reported. “We are looking for major
gifts to finance this consiruction. not
a fund raising drive. The reason we
are seeking large gifts is that W&L.'s

Hotchkiss pointed out. “I think we

“| think the council shows consider-
able promise. It must develop its
own method of doing things, It is a
place where all attitudes from the
faculty and students can be ex-
pressed.”

“I think it is significant that co-
chairmen be elected for this coun-
cil, The students and faculty will be
on more equal footing.”

“As I see it the Council has a
threefold function: final control over
student affairs, review of faculty
committees and a forum of discus-
sion, where items of concern can be
studied.”

No student representatives have
been elected to the University Coun
cil, so the Executive Committeemen
served as representatives for this
first meeting. Sudent Body Presi-
dent Fran Lawrence served as

spokesman for the students who at-
tended the session,

Lawrence reflected that “every-
thing went pretty well, we basically
laid out general plans for future
meetings. I want to tell everybody
that the meetings are open and the
council plans to meet on Saturdays
before each monthly faculty meet-
ing.”

“Everything went rather infor-
mally.” Lawrence noted. “I was
really happy with the attitude of the
faculty. They seemed interested in
what students think.”

The permanent members to the
University Council will be elected
during the normal balloting for class
officers and EC menrbers, March 25
Petitions with 50 signatures will be
required from candidates and nvust
be submitted by March 22.

Student Recruitment Committee,
of which he is currently chairman.

Filing petitions for Vice President
were Glenn Azuma and John Cas-
sell, both juniors. Azuma is from
New Milford, N.J. and Cassell is
from Virginia Beach, Va.

Three men are in the race for Sec-
retary of the Student Body. Jim
Davis, Petersburg, Va., Rick Gray,
Dallas, Texas, and Bruce Madison,
Louisville, Ky. are all seeking the
office. Davis and Madison are jun-

Richard Middleton and Gary Po-
liakoff filed petitions for Dance
Board Vice President. Richard is
from Charlottesville, Va. and Spar-
tanburg, S.C. is Gary’s home.

Brian Greig from Austin, Texas
will run against Paul Suthern from
Fairfield, Conn. for President of
Fancy Dress.

In its meeting last evening the
IFC nominated Bill Andrews, SAE,
and Bob LaRue, Sigma Chi for
President. Nominated for Vice Presi-
dent of the IFC were Griff Steel,

Bartlesville, Okla.

Alan Sondheim
Scheduled For
Concert, Talks

Alan Sondheim, leading electronic
musician, will visit Washington and
Lee Thursday and Friday (March 4
and 5) to deliver a series of lectures
and demonstrations and a_ public
concert.

Sondheim and his groun draw
from many sources in their work:
oniental, classical, electronic, jazz
and rock. They are, however, seek-
ing to create an entirely new body of
music in which those influences are
avoided. Instead of a synthesis of ex-
isting sounds, then, they attempt to
deal with a “musical absolute,” and
to do so as emotionally as possible.

The two-<lay event at Washington
and Lee is sponsored by the Con-
cert Guild, and all events are open
to the public. The first program,
scheduled for Thursday at 4 p.m. in
Lee Chapel, will be a lecture and
demonstration of electronic music,
dealing with recent art, synthesizer,
design, symmetry, information the-
ory and acoustic coding.

Friday's programs will begin at
11:40 a.m., also in the Chapel, with
a lecture on recent developments in
the electronic music field. Sondheim
and his group's concert is scheduled
for 8 that evening, again in the Lee
Ohapel.

Sondheim first became interested
in music in 1962 at the age of 19. He
is completely selfdaught. At the
same time, he acquired a passionate
interest in buying and restoring old
instruments, beginning with wood-
winds and moving quickly to every
other type.

Part of the Sondheim programs
will be entirely improvised within
a set electronic or acoustic structure

the music is partly determined by
the initial situation.

 

The concrete base for the new

swimming pool has been poured,

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

March 3, 1971

To The Students, With Respect...

We've decided that it’s past due for a few comments which
we were unable to insert in our front page editorial of last
week. It has been customary for the editors of The Ring-tum
Phi to lambast the Executive Committee, the Dance Board,
the faculty and the administration in the hope that the student
body would take some note of what the newspaper had to say
about improving the institutions that supposedly worked for
the good of the students.

But we have directed our attention in the past few weeks to
the student body itself, rather than their institutions, because
we found (much to no one’s surprise) that the Washington
and Lee student body was singularly sonambulant in its at-
titude towards the new constitution which failed by default to
pass students’ approval last week. A week after we printed that
editorial on the front page, we've realized we've been grossly
unfair.

In attempt to rectify that error in judgment of last week,
we put forth several observations and admonitions for the stu-
dent body in which we hope our readers will take some in-
terest:

@ Students at Washington and Lee are no wilder than
they were 40 years ago. They are perhaps less so—there are
fewer fights nowadays with the cadets at V.M.I. and street
brawling is altogether extinct as a pastime. As for being ac-
tive on campus, students attending the 1971 Washington and
Lee certainly do not share the same excitement that the 1951
students probably had during elections for student government
officers or for Mock Convention preparations. The most signi-
ficant comment that can be made about 1971 Washington and
Lee is that students have longer hair than the students of the
past 40 years have had, and that the tradition of conventional
dress is being permanently entombed by zealous defenders of
the right of students to wear what they want to wear.

@ The students themselves have institutionalized their
own adolescence, Every student institution on the W&L camp-
us receives support from the student body only when it pro-
poses some motion which will immediately make the lives of
the students more congenial (i.c., Saturday classes were eli-
minated because of student response—now nothing happens
at W&L on Saturday except sports events). The anguished cry
against the concept of in loco parentis echoes with hypocrisy
now: students demand to have charge of their own affairs in
the matter of female visiting hours in the dormitories or the
fraternity houses—not because they want “the experience of
being able to govern one’s own social behavior”—hecause they
want the freedom to have women in more private quarters. In
essence the characteristic adolescent fallacy which the student
body has promoted has been the sophomoric line, “You give me
the freedom, and I'll take the responsibility.” The percentage
of the student body which has turned its attention to “re
sponsibility” in any facet of student government is minute.

@ The “I've go it, I've got it ...— You take it” syndrome
is everywhere. A case in point is the experience the English de-
partment had when it turned to its majors for suggestions con-
cerning the subjects for seminars this year. It seemed that the
department had received quite a few requests from students
who wished to propose various topics for seminars they wished
to take in the fall and spring of this year. Yet last year when
meetings of majors were planned, few of the over 50 majors
in the department attended, thus leaving the choice for the
seminars in the hands of a small student group and the Eng-
lish faculty. This syndrome has its roots in the reasoning: “I
want to have the option to participate in proposing a course of
collective action, but that the option, once available, can be
exercised by someone else since | probably won't have the
time.”

@ Perhaps a great percentage of the W&L student body
would be just as happy if they were attending a trade school in
the Shenandoah Valley with the name Washington and Lee
Institute. We sense that the predominant attitude of the stu-
dent body (the law school excepted) approaches its course
each term with as much enthusiasm as a man with a pick axe
who is confronted with a patch of ground in which he knows
he must dig a hole. Maybe students would extract more enjoy-
ment from their college days Working with their hands in a
metal shop instead of sitting at a desk studying texts and
notes which seem to have no immediate bearing on his past, his
present and his murky future, Some students probably wouldn't
mind a trade school education—as long as they continued to
have financial support from their parents, But that belongs in
our final observation and our conclusive advice to the student
body....

@ Students of Washington and Lee, these are the best
years of your lives, Don't waste your time studying or voting
in elections, or even walking up to the Hill. Spring is here now,
you've just got your money for March from your parents, so
go out and buy some beer, take a road trip, then go out into the
hinterlands. Spend money— it’s not yours, so what do you
care? And spring is “in” this year, so don't waste your time
at school. Relax,

Results Of Honor System Survey

(Editor’s note: The following are the results of the Honor System Survey
which was taken last fall, The Executive Committee has finally released its
contents to The Ring-tum Phi more than three months after the survey was
taken. Deletions have been made in the survey due to improper wording
which caused contradictory results. It should also be noted that only 337 of
the student body responded to the survey, representing a sector of student
opinion, but certainly not a majority,

The EC will publish an interpretation of this survey next week; the
group might also propose several changes in the Honor System as a result of
this poll and present them for a student body referendum,

One main result gleaned from the poll is that this section of Washington
and Lee students which the EC studied is in favor of the absolute penalty and
the existence of an Honor System at this University.)

QUESTIONS

A. Geographical Distribution Yes No

1. Do you feel that any violation of the consensus 111 203
Honor System should be dealt with regardless
of geographical location? (i.e., theft in any
other city or state in U.S.)

2. Do you feel that a violation occuring in ar- 183 117
other country during the short term of 12-12-6
should be considered by the Executive Com-
mittee?

3. Do you feel that the jurisdiction of the Honor 174 136
System should be delineated so as to include
only a limited geographical area?

4. Do you feel that the jurisdiction of the Honor 153 166
System should be confined to violations occur-
ing on the W&L campus or in the immediately
surrounding area?

5. Do you feel that the Honor System should 85 233
apply only to the W&L campus?
6. Do you feel that any restriction placed on the 136 190

geographical applicability of the Honor System
will serve to undermine or defeat the purpose
the purpose of that system?
7. As opposed to strictly geographical guidelines, 220 95
do you feel that the following criteria is ap-
propriate?
‘Any act perpetuated by a student, represent-
ing himself to be a W&L student and as a re-
sult receiving special consideration, which is
a violation of the Honor System should be
dealt with by the Executive Committee.’
B. Time Jurisdiction
1. The Honor System at present may be applicable 172 138
to a student throughout his academic career.
(From the time of initial registration until his
termination of his status as a student, i.e., gra-
duation or withdrawal). Do you feel that such
application of the Honor System is appropriate?

2. Do you feel that the Honor System should be 126 188
applicable throughout each calendar year?

3. Do you feel that the Honor System should be 194 109
applicable only during each adcademic year?

4. Should the academic year be defined so as to 123 177
include vacations?

5. Do you feel that such definition and/or limita- 113 191

tion of the duration of coverage of the Honor
System is contrary to the spirit or intent of the
system?
C. Jurisdiction as to Lying—Cheating—Stealing
1. At the present time any instance of “lying, 228 78
cheating, or stealing” is considered to be a
breach of the Honor System. The Honor System
of W&L is based on a sole principle: “a man
shall conduct himself as a gentleman at all
times.” Because the system is based on such a
principle, it cannot be specifically codified in
every respect. Do you feel that such a basis for
the Honor System is presently viable in rela-
tion to today’s society?
. Do you feel that the Honor System should be 57 257
limited in application to academic matters only?

Letters To The

many alternative actions. Mr. Spence

tw

3. Do you feel that written work (i.e., term papers, 154 148
themes) should be considered as cold?
4. Do you feel that cold tests-quizzes should be 259 47

excluded from the aegis of the Honor System,
as is now the present procedure?
D. Open or Closed Trials
1. At present time honor trials are closed to the 231 150
student body at large. Do you feel that this is
the most appropriate procedure?

2. Do you feel instead that these trials should be 64 249
open to the student body from inception?
3. If you are in favor of an open trial procedure, 153 69

do you feel that the E.C. should retain the pre-
rogative to close the hearing for special consid-
erations and/or deliberations?
4. Do you feel that an open trial would serve an 92 180
educational and/or therapeutic purpose for the
student body?

E. Procedure for Notification of Other Schools as to

Honor Violation

1. Do you feel that there should be any notifica- 50 254
tion—other than to the parents of a convicted
student—as to violation of the Honor System?

2. At the present time, conviction of an honor vio- 148 166
lation does result in notation being made upon
the convicted student's transcript. The notifica-
tion reads ‘that the student has withdrawn from
the University without official permission’. Upon
inquiry the University will inform another
school as to the reason for withdrawal and as to
the exact nature of the honor violation, Do
you feel that this is proper procedure?

3. If there is notation made on the transcript, do 109 173
you feel that such information should ‘be sup-
plied voluntarily?

F. Past Conviction Procedure

1. Do you feel that a student found guilty of an 154 150
honor violation should be required to sever all
connections with the University and leave the
campus within a 24-hour period (the above rep-
resents the present procedure)?

2. If a student is found guilty of an honor viola- 178 224
tion, do you feel that he should be required to
spend the ensuing night in lodging off campus
in the company of several members of the Exe-
cutive Committee (the above represents the pre-

sent procedure)?
G. Penalty
i, Do you feel that the absolute penalty is essen- 173 145
tial to the continuance of a viable honor system?
2. Do you feel that there should be an absolute 224 91
penalty?
3. If adoption of some form of graduation of 38 275

penalties were to lead to the administration and
faculty taking over administration of the Honor
System, do you feel that such an Honor System
would be desirable?

4. Do you feel that in the event of a system en- 205 100
compassing graduation of penalties that the
E.C, should have the prerogative to determine
what would be the appropriate penalty for each
particular violation?

s if you feel that the E.C. should be granted this 185 65
discretionary power, then do you feel it proper
to base such a determination partially upon the
integrity witnessed during the actual trial? (i.e.,
a person who voluntarily confesses his guilt
might be hled in a different light than a stu-
dent who perjures himself before the Com-
mittee).

6. Do you feel that it is feasible to have an honor 48 261
system which has no penalty other than public
censure and/or dissemination of facts concern-

; a the violation?

Editor On Spence, ROTC

Stevens” Letter
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

My remarks here are addressed to
the column written by Mr. Spence.
Mr. Spence advocates reducing the
penalty for an honor violation in
certain cases. (e.g. If he is ever tried.)
However, there is something wrong
with his thinking. His assessment of
the three major elements of the
Honor System is, although incom-
plete, entirely correct.

However, as he proceeds with his
comments, he seems to forget what
he said just a moment before. But
we will get to that later. True, the
Honor System is a “dying institu-
tion,” but it is dying not because of
the ukimate penalty but because of
a change in student attitudes toward
honor. The decline in the Honor
Sysiem has come to this schoo! in
the company of a decline in a “gen-
tlemanly” attitude toward other peo-
ple, which used to guide a WAL stu-
dent's conduct.

Mr. Spence is crazy if he thinks
the students of twenty years ago did
not “pass judgment” on a potential
honor violation before turning some-
one in. He must have in order to de-
cide whether it was a possible honor
violation, He probably did this un-
consciously.

The problem now rests in the fact
that not only are students more in-
clined to knugh in the face of the
Honor System and say to themselves,
“that makes it all the easier,” but
peer pressure is against turning
someone in even for the most flag-
rant honor violation, This is the
same attitude that marks the break-
down in the laws of our cities, states,
and country, This is the same type of
thinking that prompts the quote, “all
nares Ought to be shot,”

Mr. Spence forgets that the EC
(or Honor Council) has the ex officio
power to do as # sees fit with Honor
cases. Kt can, by virtue of its “secret”
wutonomy, treat each individual case
us it sees fit, and has recourse to

seemed to recognize this fact in his
assessment of the three chief ele-
ments of the Honor System, but not
here.

A few final comments on the
Honor System are in order. As | see
it, the ultimate penalty insures a per-
son who, for one reason or another,
has something to do with a W&L
graduate that he is a man of honor,
For that reason, the honor system
should not be restricted to this camp-
us or the period of the school year.
It should apply to all students at all
times, from enrollment to gradua-
tion or withdrawal.

Washington and Lee should de-
mand honor of its students. Any stu-
dent who cannot be considered hon-
orable under the Honor Code has
no business being a Washington and
Lee student,

Back To ROTC...

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Phere have been many points rais-
ed on the ROTC question here on
campus, but in all the confusion the
most important ones seem to have
been overlooked, The issue will not
be decided on the academic merits
of ROTC but on the nature of the
Reserve Officers Training Program
itself,

The most constructive criticiem
advanced at the ROTC forum (which
the Phi didn't even see fit to cover)
concerned the fact that the ROTC
Dept. is the only Department on
campus not open to any interested
student. What I mean is that you
cannot take a ROTC course as an
elective—-you can't even audit one
lt is a foranembers-only group, This
seems to est it apart from the resi
of the University and separate it out
for special attention. This type of ex-
chusive closed program is hardly in
line with the concepts of academic
freedom and intellectual curiosity

which define the academic commun-
ity.

It was coach Nonman Lord who
first brought this up, so don't write
it off as “left-wing trickery.” He was
upset to learn that ROTC excludes
“non-majors” completely. | made a
direct oral request to Col. Mortis,
Dept. head, for permission to audit
the course, assuring him | would not
ibe “disruptive.” He refused, saying:
“We have a product to sell and the
presence of any outsider (?) would
hamper our selling it to regular stu-
dents.” This smacks of mind mani-
pulation. Col. Morris consistently re-
ferred to ROTC as a “training”
course, which is quite different from
an “education” course. Even the
business and computer courses are
educational, not “training.”

But my biggest complaint about

ROTC is exactly the point raised
most often to defend it—academic
(here meaning from a student's point
of view) freedom. A ROTC student
does not have the individual free-
doms deemed so essential to the pur-
suit of truth and knowledge.
ROTC students may not question
the subject matter they are being
taught or the value of the military
establishment without suffering dis-
iplinary action, They are not free to
pursue their interests, No attempt is
made to cover or even consider the
miihary philosophy and history of
Mao Tse-Tung or Ho Ohi Minh or
Che Guevara, The army will not
permit such “intellectual freedom.”
And the army decides what ROTC
can or cannot do, can or cannot
teach. ROTC students have been dis-

BY MARC SMALL

The rejection of the proposed
Constitution by the Student Body
last week did more than postpone or
forestall the creation of a student
senate on this campus: it also gave a
new lease on life to one of the most
enjoyable parts of W&L tradition.

Article Il, Section B (1.) of the
Old Constitution (the one still in
effect) calls for election of a Fancy
Dress President—an office many of
us had thought defunct when the
Dance Board decided not to hold a
‘Fancy Dress Ball this year. While
it is a moot point whether Fancy
Dress would return without a presi-
dent—and there have been active
forces attempting to bring about its
resurrection—it is a definite boon
for its advocates to have a person
formally designated as the organizer.

The Dance Board has had great
problems over the past three years—
changing student preferences in
music, declining sales in Dance plans,
and a more manifest apathy toward
activities of this sort. However, the

“Conservative”
Is Rejuvenated

“The Southern Conservative,” a
political opinion magazine published
during the 1960s, has been resurrect-
ed by two students and will resume
publication this week.

Supported by private donations,
the “Conservative” will appear every
other month for the remainder of
the current academic year, accord-
ing to William H. Miller Il, its edi-
tor.

The new periodical is a joint pro-
ject of Miller, a leader of Washing-
ton and Lee’s campus chapter of
Young Americans for Freedom, and
Greg C. Raetz of the Conservative
Society. In a statement of editorial
purpose, they said the “Conserva-
tive” is designed “to provide a rea-
soned, literate and sophisticated al-
ternative to the ‘counter-culture.’ ”

According to Miller, crucial sup-
port for the new “Southern Conser-
vative” has come from Rep. Philip
Crane (R.-lll.), a prominent House
conservative who visited Washing-
ton and Lee as part of the “Contact
1971” symposium last month.

De Cursu Honorum

aes

demise of Fancy Dress was not a
pretty thing: it would have been far
more desirable to have had it for-
mally voted out of existence than to
have it so miserably ignored as it
was during the Big Five elections a
year ago. Perhaps Fancy Dress is no
longer wanted at W&L—and from
the turn-out my freshman and sopho-
more years I find that quite hard to
‘believe—but if such is the case, then
a concerted drive to abolish it is
more healthy than allowing it to
strangle on with no hope of re-
covery.

It is a possibility that my whole
article is in vain: if there are no
candidates this year, then the chances
of bringing it back are that much
smaller. At the time of this writing,
though, I have been approached by
one eager and interested person who
was ‘busily getting his petition filled
out, and it is likely that the first page
of the “Phi” you now read will list
one or more students who give a
damn to keep a worthwhile tradition
alive,

Many things could be done to
Fancy Dress: perhaps, as Bill Wil-
liams, Law Freshman and last year’s
VMI Dance Chairman, has suggest-
ed, co-ordinating it with VMI, bring-
ing in more money and more people,
perhaps making the Dance Board's
finances an assessment in our tui-
tion, as is the “Phi” or the “Calyx,”
perhaps revitalizing it was more
modern formats and groups, or, per-
haps, returning to the Masked Ball
of the past. The ideas are myriad,
and are not really the concern of this
writer. Rather, it is my belief that a
sincere vote and a sincere candidate
may produce that wonder of won-
ders on par with the five-cent nickel
and the one-hundred cent dollar:
the preservation of a piece of our
heritage that a good number of the
(University Community — students,
faculty, and townspeople, enjoyed
and felt was deserving of the com-
munity’s support.

The decision is not mine alone,
but ours. If there are candidates—
and I am sure that at least one will
appear—then it would speak well of
a CONCERNED student body to
climb out of their dorms and apart-
ments to vote in a responsible per-
son to what once had been an office
of great merit at this school. Fancy
Dress may yet live again—but only
if we give a damn and give a vote.

Registrar’s Report Tells Of

Letters
To the Editor

Students Only!

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

In the past few months, the use
of university facilities by unauthoriz-
ed people has become extremely an-
noying .These people, usually any-
where from kindergarten to high
school, make free use of the student
center and gym in great numbers,
especially on weekends.

The average crowd in the game
and television rooms fluctuates be-
tween ten and 30 on weekends and
in somewhat smaller numbers dur-
ing the week. Since the gameroom
and gym are used on a first come
first served basis, the students often
find themselves in direct competi-
tion with these people for the use of
the facilities.

The destruction of things such as
ping-pong tables and pin ball ma-
chines is also part of my complaint.
I don't think the young “townies”
can be blamed for all of the destruc-
tion, because the students do their
share, but certainly they do some of
it, and at the expense of the students
and university.

I feel that these university owned
and student financed areas should be
for the use of the college community
only, and that some policy should
be agreed upon by either the Smu-
dent Center Committee or the EC
concerning this problem. It seems to
me that the university and students
do enough for the town without hav-
ing to provide the university facili-
ties as a playground for the Lexine-
ton “youngsters.”

is an insightful commentary on the
University’s academic complexion.

The report shows that of 889 I
grades taken at the end of the
strike-semester of 1970, 77 were A,
240 B, 248 C, 115 D, and 150 F.
Although a large percentage of I
grades were recorded as D and F,
the percentages of those grades in
the second semester grade record are
not significantly changed.

Enrollment during the 1969-70
year decreased slightly in spite of
the fact that entering freshmen
classes (both law and undergraduate)
increased slightly. The enrollment
breakdown was as follows: 1001
Arts and Sciences, 249 Commerce,
185 Law, and 16 Independent Scho-
lars and Special Students. Total:
1451.

Total enrollment for the current
year is the highest ever, over 1500.
In 1948 W&L boasted 800 under-
graduate students.

WA&L had just one more summa
cum laude graduate, five, than in
1959, 14 magna’s and 46 cum’s.

The trend is for higher grades to
awarded the second semester, 106
students made the Honor Roll first
semester, 146 the second; 33 made
all A's first semester, 47 the second;
316 made Dean's List first semester,
423 the second. Of all grades given
in the second semester 21% were A,
36.8 B, 27.9 C, 6.8 D and 3.4 F.
The Fine Arts department awarded
the most A’s, 221; Military Science
awarded the highest percentage of
A's, 66%. Among the larger depart-
ments, Philosophy gave the highest
percentage of F's, 7%.

At the end of the first semester
last year 69 students were on acade-
mic probation, the lowest in four
years, although at the same time, the
largest number in four years fell
into the shadow of the automatic
rule, 23. As the automatic rule was
suspended for the second semester,
similar statistics for it are not avail-
able.

Of 322 ‘baccalaureate degrees
awarded, 74 were majors in History,
46 in Law, 38 in Business Admini-
stration and 22 in Boonomies.

BY JEFFREY B. SPENCE

Two weeks ago this column raised
the issue of the way the present
‘Honor System seems to be going. It
was pointed out that there seems to
‘be a reluctance on the part of stu-
dents today to uphold the system
with the same vigor they have in the
past. One of the main reasons point-
ed out was the harshness of the ulti-
mate penalty. The alternative offer-
ed was to add to the ultimate pen-
alty another penalty of a lesser na-
ture in the form of a one year su-
spension, rather than permanent ex-
ipulsion, Well, as do all opinions, this
one has drawn some objection. How-
ever, the way this objection has been
voiced is curious.

if you read the Letters to the Edi-
tor in this issue, you will find the
objection I refer to penned under the
name of a Mr. Carl Stevens. Mr. Ste-
vens seems to think that I wrote my
article of a fortnight ago purely out
of self interest. Since I have never
violated the Honor System, nor do
I ever intend to I resent the implica-
tion of what Mr. Stevens has said in
his letter,

Furthermore, I find this young
man’s choice of words quite distaste-
ful in his statement that, “Mr. Spence
is crazy if he thinks the students of
twenty years ago did not ‘pass judg-
ment’ on a potential honor violation
before turning someone in.” Mr.
Stevens may not agree with my point

bE
of view, (in fact 1 welcome criticism)
‘but hurling personal epithets is posi-
tively unmannerly. Since Mr. Ste-
vens is so worried that there is a gen-
eral breakdown of gentlemanly con-
duct maybe he ought to look to him-
self ‘before he casts the first stone at
anyone.

Mr. Stevens seems to be an advo-
cate of law and order both on camp-
us and throughout the United States.
Yet, right after he finishes telling us
that the breakdown of our Honor
System is just another symptom of
ithe lawless trend in our nation, he
turns an about face and advocates
awlessness on the part of the Exeou-
tive Committee. Obviously Mr. Ste-
vens has not read the pamphlet en-
titled, “The Honor System,“ which
‘was prepared by the E, C. of the
1968-69 session. This pamphlet ex-
plains some of the explicit restric-
tions on the E. C. as well as on the
witnesses or the defendant in the
case in question. The secrecy of the
trial is not to allow the E.C. to do
with a defendant what it wants but
rather to protect him from public
ridicule if he is found innocent. In
fact, the Executive Committee can-
not do what ever it pleases with any
case presented to it.

Mr. Stevens’ final claim to fame
on the Honor System question is that

Hoopsters Win CAC Tournament

BY PALMER TRICE

The Generals have finally won the
battle, and the war is over, The bas-
ketball team climaxed what must be
considered a fanastic season, especi-
ally in lieu of the loss of last year’s
stars. Down the stretch drive, the
Blue won one contest in overtime,
and then swept the CAC Tourna-
ment.

Last Tuesday, the Generals hope-
fully closed out the career of Lucky
Ol’ Doremus, with a win, The ball
club trailed for the large majority of
the game, but, as the critics say, re-

 

Player of the Week :

fused to fold. They were down by 11
with less than three minutes to play.
All seemed lost. But no! Out of the
sky came Super Skip. He quickly
brought the team back into conten-
tion, and Mike Daniel put in the ty-
ing bucket, to send the game into
overtime.

As all good stories end, so does
this one. Super Skip is not to be stop-
ped. He pulls eight points from
somewhere on his \person, and with
the help of Ellie Gutshall’s last sec-
ond shot grabs victory from the jaws
of defeat. A suitable victory for a

 

PAUL McCLURE

Cinderella team. But Paul McLure
and his dwarfs will be back next
year,

So the Generals proceed to the
big tournament. Of course, this is the
year when everyone plans to take the
championship away from the Blue.
Had W&L, who had won the CAC
Tournament for 3 of the last 4
years ,not lost: two All-Americans?
Yes... But, this ball club still had
something to prove to a still disbe-
lieving public. They did so, They
breezed through both games, playing
everyone in both contests. The final
game was not even close, as the Gen-
erals breezed by with an 85-71 vic-
tory.

Notice

There will be a meeting of the
Washington and Lee Ecology Club
on Thursday, March 4 at 8:30 in
room 112 of the Student Union
Building.

“We are not trying to rebuild for
a new era. We have begun that new
era.” As to next year’s chances for
W&L in taking the tournament.
Coach Canfield succinctly put it on
the line—‘We plan on it.”

Congratulations are extended to
Mike Daniel, the tournament's Most
Valuable Player and also All-OAC,
and to Paul MeoLure, who joined
Mike on the All-CAC team. Paul,
according to his coach, played the
best game that any big man has play-
ed around here in quite a while. His
statistics will not be printed in this
issue, as they were so amazing that ]
must check the Sports Information
Department about them.

The Tournament was the success-
ful climax of a season of hardwork.
Che General defense worked beauti-
fully throughout the Tournament.

A 17-8 record isn’t bad for a team
that just rated a “Generals Rebuild-
ing” title from its own newspaper at
the beginning of the year. Congratu-
lations to all.

  

LaRue’s Press Box

After the events of the past week-
end, a few notable campus dwellers
have gotten their adding machines
and final CAC standings out to see if
Washington and Lee has a chance in
1971 to win the Big Bell. Perhaps a
history course for the Class of 1974
is in order,

Briefly, the Big Bell is the gift of
the Norfolk and Western Railroad
and is the College Athletic Confer-
ence’s symbol of the best all around
jock school. Points are accumulated
according to each institution’s stand-
ing in the intercollegiate activities—
football, cross country, ‘basketball,
swimming, wrestling, baseball, golf,
tennis, and track. The school with
the most points at the end of the
year wins The Bell, the CAC’s high-
est honor,

The Generals enhanced their posi-
tion fantastically, as the basketball
and swimming teams both won their
respective championships and the
wrestling squad tied for seoond with

Oldtimers Fall Victim To Varsity 33-20

Washington and Lee's Varsity
Football Team, under the tutelage of
Head Coach Buck Leslie, wound up
its spring practice session with high
hopes for next season after ripping
an Alumni squad loaded with former
standouts, 33-20. A crowd of several
hundred fans, many of them return-
ing alumni, watched the encounter
on Wilson Field.

Steve Fluharty, the Generals’ quar-
terback who began last autumn on
the bench and wound wp as a Little
All America candidate, was, as ex-
pected, the big gun for the Varsity,
and he quickly ignited the high scor-
ing affair with a touchdown pass to
Chappy Conrad. Doug Chase, the
Generals’ Lexingtonian field goal
kicker, drilled home the extra point
for a 7-0 lead,

Jim Farrar, who played a key role
for the Varsity last year when only a

freshman, carried on a one yard
plunge for the second Varsity touch-
down and a 13-0 spread on the next
ball possession. Fluharty then de-
monstrated his versatility as a quar-
terback by scampering off on a 23
yard touchdown run in the second
quarter which, coupled with another
Chase kick, built up a 20-0 lead.

Outstanding all afternoon was the
Generals’ defensive platoon, but iper-
haps their most outstanding play
came midway through the period
when they barged in to block an
Alumni punt and recovered it in the
end zone for a touchdown. Lane
Nalley, a linebacker, got credit for
the TD.

Bruce Green, who converted many
passes into touchdowns while star-
ring for the Generals at his flanker
position, came up with the initial
Alumni touchdown, late in the first
half.

Green hauled in a nine yard pass
from Jack Baizley, the backup quar-
terback on the 1969 squad. Baizley
would later sprint three yards for a
final touchdown, in addition to exe-
cuting a two point conversion play.

With Leslie checking out various
combinations of his squad in the sec-
ond half, the hot scoring hand of the
Opening stanzas simmered. Rising
junior quarterback Tom Van Am-
burgh did combine with halfback
Bill Wallace on a twenty five yard
scoring pitch, however.

Doug Gossmann, an outstanding
blocker while an undergraduate,
completed the Alumni scoring with
a one yard burst.

be an outstanding success, Aside

On The CAC Standings

   

Washington University, behind Se-
wanee. Thus in one weekend, Wash-
ington and Lee moved from dead
last to second place. The Blue trails

St. Louis based Washington ‘by just
five points and out distances third
place Sewanee by 231% tallies,

W&L’s chances to return the bell
to Lexington appear to be fair to
good. But the race is sure to be close
and the Generals must consistently
place near the top in the four re-
maining spring sports. The Wash-
ington Bears have a tough record in
these activities, as last year’s Spring
Sports Carnival seems to indicate.

Washington won baseball and
grabbed second place in tennis. WU
also copped third place in golf, but
could only get fourth ranking in
track. However an added incentive
and a definite advantage for the
Bears is the fact that they host this
year’s Spring Sports Tournament.

_ And speaking of bells, congratula-
tions are in order to all three Wash-
ington and Lee squads who perform-
ed so well. Coach Verne Canfield’s
hardcourt hustlers won their second
straight OAC championship and
their fourth in the past five cam-
paigns. And over in the VMI tank,
Coach Bill Stearns guided the Gen-
eral aquanauts to another first place
finish. The two smaller replicas of
The Bell, awarded to champions in
individual sports, will be welcome
additions to the trophy case.

Swimmers Capture CAC,
Finish Second In State

Chalk up one more successful
year to W&L swimming. For the
past 30 years or so, General swim
teams have always preserved win-
ning seasons. This year’s squad tal-
lied a 5-4 dual meet record as well as
a second in the state and a first in
the conference. It was the third time
in five years that the CAC trophy
was presented to Coach Bill Stearns,
and the future looks even more pro-
mising.

The state meet was held Febru-
ary 19 and 20 at Norfolk. Leading
the Generals to their second place
finish were, Bill Brumback, 50 and
100 freestyle champion, Bim Clark
100 and 200 fly winner, Alan Cor-
with, 200 freestyle winner, and Steve
Erikson, 100 backstroke champion.
The 400 freestyle relay team of Cor-
with, Clark, Brumback and Owen

Sharp captured the remaining Wash-

Leads Matmen In CAC

Captain Dee Copenhaver captured
first place in the 177-lbs. division.
Teammates Bill Melton and Jim
Stieff placed first at 134 Ibs. and 150
Ibs., respectively.

Sewanee placed four conference
champions. Washington University
equalled the Generals with three.

Freshman Bill Melton provided an
exciting match in the finals when he
won a judges’ decision, overtime vic-
tory over highly touted, two-time
champ Yogi Anderson of Sewanee.

Melton and Anderson were tied
3-3 at the end of regulation time,
each scoring a takedown and an es-
cape. During the three one-minute
overtime periods, Melton made sev-
eral attempts at a takedown. The
judges awarded him the victory on
the basis of aggressiveness.

At 150 lbs., freshman Jim Steiff
upset top-seeded Billings of Sewanee.
After looking strong in the semi-
final matches, Steiff started slowly
against Billings. Stieff managed a
hard ride and a takedown on his op-
ponent; but Billings managed to es-
cape in the third period. Stieff pre-
vented Billings from getting a take-
down to clinch the victory.

Senior Dee Copenhaver capped
an outstanding career by winning
one of the toughest classes in the
tournament, Copenhaver, twice
champ at 190 Ibs., drapped to 177 to

After pinning his man in the semi-
finals, Copenhaver faced Elder of
Sewanee, who entered the champion-
ship with a 12-1-1 record. Copen-
haver secured a takedown and rode
Elder out in the second period; and
Elder managed a reversal. Copen-
haver got an escape and secured a
victory.

Freshman Craig Hankins received
first seed at 126 Ibs. After pinning

he was upset 4-0 by his Washington

were new state records.

Last weekend, the CAC confer-
ence meet convened at VMI. It turn-
ed out to be no contest. The Gen-
erals racked up 185 points, followed
by Sewanee, 125, Washington, 63,
Centre, 42, and Southwestern, 19.

Bight of 17 firsts fell to the power
of the Blue.

Bill Brumback captured his two
specialities, the 50 and 100 free-
style. Clark won the 100 fly, Bert
Meem captured the 200 fly and
Alan Corwith won the 400 freestyle.
The 400 medley relay, composed of
Erickson, Clark, Brumiback and Rick
Sands, the 400 freestyle relay of
Sharp, Corwith, Clark, and Brum-
back, and the 800 freestyle relay of
Sharp, Lawlor, Corwith and Brum-
back, all nan away with first places.

Three individuals in five events
have qualified for the Nationals on
March 19 and 20. Brumiback, Clark,
and Erickson will attempt to continue
the fine success that W&L swimmers
have had at this meet in recent years.
Brumback, already an All America,
was also named as co-winner of the
outstanding swimmer award at the
CAC meet.

With an eye to the future, Coach
Stearns sees a very promising squad.

Although losing a two-time All
America, Bill Brumback, to gradua-
tion, the Generals have a few top
high school swimmers waiting in the
wings. These individuals could well
turn out to be All Americans them-
selves. The return of an entire group
of seniors next year, will make for
an experienced team and will assure
W&L of nothing less than excep-
tional swimming.

Stevens’ Letter

his career here at school. If our self-
appointed savior of the Honor Sys-
tem fears its total destruction so
much then why does he advocate
that which will make the system
breakdown because of unmanagabil-
ity?

Mr. Sievens sure seems to be up-
set. His letter set me to wondering
who he was, so I investigated. The
Registrar does not seem to have him
on the rolls as a student here at
WA&L. His name does not aippear in
our student directory, nor for that
matter in the local Lexington tele-
phone directory. Thus, I checked to
see if he has ever been a student,
Well, according to the secretary at
the Alumni House, he has never
been a student here at W&L either
as an undergraduate or a law stu-
dent! One wonders then, who the
mysterious Mr, Carl Stevens is?

At this point I still don’t know.
Either he is someone with no con-
nection in his life that links him with
Washington and Lee or, he does not
exist. If he does not exist then who
wrote the letter? I certainly hope it
was not one of our own students
who lacked the nerve to sign his own
name, which by the way is an act of
lying. Therefore would the real Carl
Stevens please stand up, since as
every law and order advocate knows,
a man has a right to face his accuser,

iplined for participation in anti-war
activities—thus limiting their free-
dom to dissent and even freedom of
speech. A W&L ROTC student was
lectured and warned for daring to
sign the petition to remove ROTC
credit. Col. Morris is guilty of dup-
licitty.

ROTC students may not dress ex-
pressly but must wear uniforms
(‘uniforms regiment the mind as
well as the appearance”). They may
not let their hair grow long or wear
beards, or even long sideburns. And
Col. Morris dares use the word “free-
dom” to defend the department!

The point is that ROTC is not
commensurate with a university at-
mosphere and should not have uni-
versity credit. In fact, I think it
shouldn’t be here at all. I call upon
the University to remove ROTC
from campus and wpon the students

American Freedom

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

A few comments on last week’s
Through a Spyglass Darkly .. .
column “On Freedom”,

I agree whole-heartedly with the
first part of Mr. Small’s article. In
my opinion his analysis of the state
of American society today replete
with its dissipation of individual li-
berty, its lack of true leadership, and
its semi-blindness to the ideals of op-
portunity and freedom as our pri-
mary national goals was quite cor-
rect.

However, | strongly disagree with
his labelling of a “basic presumption
of human charity” as an unrealistic
supposition of the “revolutionary ni-
hilists of the radical movement.”
Quite to the contrary! The collecti-
vist philosophy of today’s radical

LETTERS TQ THE EDUTOR

movement, like the Fabian philoso-
phy of the Old Left, is a blatant con-
tradiction of the ideal of human
chanity. Both of these philosophies
are but versions of the age old myth
of statism—a philosophy wherein
mankind as a whole is too perverted,
too stupid, and too innately greedy
and self-centered to care about his
fellow man or even to know what is
good for his own well-being.

Thus the statist envisions a gov-
ernment being set up by an Enlight-
ened few (who know such things)
which would then show man what is
“right” and force him to become
“charitable”. But this is in itself a
negation of the idea of charity, as
charity (being a form of love) is a
voluntary act of the human will.
One can be forced neither to love
nor to be charitable.

When government seeks to be the
administrator of charity (as in the
collectivist or welfare state) the in-
dividual loses sight of his personal
duty toward his brother, thinking
that this responsibility has been as-
sumed by the State and is thus no
longer his real concern.

From a libertarian point of view,
1 believe that man through the in-
fluence of religion will, as an indivi-
dual, pay attention to rights (“life
liberty, and pursuit of happiness”—
happiness as he himself sees it) will
recognize and strive to guarantee
these same freedoms and opportuni-
ties to his fellow man and will come
to his assistance sohuld he be in
need. This is in my opinion the true
meaning of freedom. We in America
once made a start down this path,
but we have since wandered off. It is
high time that we find that path
again!

2000 years ago the essence of char-
ity was summed up in eleven words
— “Do unto others as you would
have others do unto you.” Our prob-
lem is not that this philosophy has
failed, but rather that it has never
been completely tried,

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Have you ever heard of a litter-
picking party? This W&L first, aimed
at cleaning up the scenic Goshen
Pass, will take place on Saturday,
March 6 at 10 a.m. Consider this a
call for all men, women, and chil-
dren to come to the aid of their
country by helping us in the fight
against pollution.

The battle is greatly aided by the
tools of cars and dates, Bring a bag
junch and meet in front of the Stu-
dent Union at 10 asm. on March 6.
Sign up in the archway of the old
dorm and garbage bags will be pro-
vided.

PPoint:
On Honor System

(Continued from Page 1)
ington and Lee students have long
taken for granted the maxim that “a
man shall conduct himself as a gen-
tleman at all times.” Certainly the
long-standing principle has been held
in good stead down through the
years, yet the key to its position of
reverence was a general consensus as
to the word “honor.”

One can no longer engage In
mulling over the relevance of hon-
orable conduct without first inquit-
ing as to another's concept of “what
is honorable conduct?” Every ume
a student faction or group OF indivi-
dual on campus infringes upon an-
other student's rights by interfering
with the educational process, every
time a student comes before the Exe-
cutive Committee and pleads his case
on the grounds that an obviously dis-
honest act is to be condoned, be-
cause his peer group views such acti-
vity as acceptable, and every time
there is a recurrence of such acts as
iMegal long distance phone calls
without apparent concern on the stu-
dents’ behalf, then there is adequate
reason to believe that there has been
a breakdown in consensus over what
should be upheld as honorable con-
duct. Yet on the questionnaire the
students who responded gave an
overwhelming affirmation 228 to 78,
in favor of preserving the absolute
sanctity of the principle of honorable
conduct.

A logical progression from the
above is that students today at Wash-
ington and Lee feel that the most ap-
propriate course of action is to live
by one’s own personal moral ethic.
One student suggested that in so do-
ing each individual should have the
discretion whether or not to turn in
another person for breaching his per-
sonal code of conduct. ;

Such a philosophy is certainly in
keeping with the gradual process of
fragmentation which is draining the
university of a great degree of
the Honor System's distinctive char-
acter and personality.

Most assuredly, the sentiment ex-
hibited in favor of codifying the pre-
sent system of include an alternate
penalty of a one year suspension is
indicative of a lack of concurrence
over the relevance and significance
of honorable conduct.

The final question on the survey
was worded, “Do you as an indivi-
dual favor the existence of Honor
System at Washington and Lee Uni-
versity?”

The vote was conclusively affirma-
tive by the margin of 295 to 15, Yet
the perhaps subconcious omission of
either the adjective an or the really
served to render the results incon-
clusive. | myself am now only assur-
ed that the consensus of the student
body is in favor of some form of
honor system .. . and that it cer-
tainly is not related whatsoever lo
that Honor System which our prede-
cessors and the founders of Wash-
ngton and Lee so cherished and
adored, and lived by.

some procedure that will allow these
people to get involved,” he said.

There was some discussion as to
whether or not the freshman class
ought to have representation on the
Council, Rich Murray commented
that someone familiar with dormi-
tory problems should be included.

It was finally decided, by a vote
of 8-2, that the University Council
consist of four seniors, three juniors,
two sophomores, one freshman, and
two Law students. The Student Body
President shall also be included.

Petitions for positions on the Uni-
versity Council, bearing 50 names,
must be submitted by the time bal-
lots are counted for the General
Election of March 22. Balloting for
the University Council representa-
tives will be held on March 25,
along with the General Election
run-offs. Election to these positions
will be by a plurality of votes cast.

No action was taken concerning
the insertion of the University Coun-
cil into the present Student Body
Constitution. The E.C. also rejected
a suggestion to put the new Constitu-
tion up to referendum again, reason-
ing that it would be unfair for the
present student body to pass a new
governmental structure that could
not go into effect until the academic
year 1972-73,

Honoraries Tap 7

to give younger men more exposure

making any decision.”

“The actual process of making de-
