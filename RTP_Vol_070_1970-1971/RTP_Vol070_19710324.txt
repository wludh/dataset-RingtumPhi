ELECTION RESULTS—

JUNIOR CLASS

Executive Committee

After the EC emerged from a long-
thy vote-counting session Monday
evening, it was revealed that Bill
Merrill of the rising junior class and
Mike Brittin of the rising sophomore
class were the only two EC candi-

koff won over Larry Evans. In sop-
homore voting Steve Greene was vic-
torious over Durant Ashmore. All
other offices are yet undetermined.

In the EC slot two votes were cast
by each person, therefore requiring

aminations. It is imyportant that each Archer Frierson 94 Run-off the winners to receive more than 2

pledge, for any reason, is not in-
cluded on work turned in as your
own work, that work is still assumed
to be pledged. That is, the work is
assumed to be done under the Honor
System.

The “traditional” written pledge
serves as a reminder to students that
academic work put forth as their
own must, in fact, be their own. The
EC felt (a bit belatedly) that the
printed pledge used last term was
a different sort of pledge—that it
tended to be a legal contract of
some sort. More importantly the
pledge seeemed to say that certain
statements, whether or not they actu-
ally constituted cheating, were them-
selves Honor Violations.

This becomes, in effect, a rule.
The Honor System would have to be
rewritten to include “lying, cheat-
ing, stealing, and talking after ex-
aminations.” Once we begin to make
specific rules within the Honor Sys-
tem, we will have to make endless
rules covering every possible situa-
tion. Very soon, these rules would
prechude all individual consideration.

Judgment would be unnecessary—
but we would all have to memorize
rule books hundreds of pages long,
and ignorance would be no excuse.
The poim seems, to me, to be a
simple one. What is—or is not—ly-
ing, cheating, or stealing, to one de-
gree or another, involves an indivi-
dual’s judgment.

The Executive Committee is elect-
ed as representative of general stu-
dent feeling, and is elected to use its
good judgment in possible Honor
Violations. This is a personal system
of justice, not an impersonal one. It
demands people, not computers.

The original problem with Inde-
pendent Exams, the one that led to a
new pledge in the beginning, was
that the Independent Examinations
were to be given to more than one
section of students. Our habits are
pretty strong, and we are used to
“cokd” exams. The printed pledge
wus supposed to remind students of
the fact that the exams were “hot.”
But it did more; it presented that re-
minder in the form of a contract,

Then the debate begins—what
about “Value Judgments?” Does the
“contract” allow them? I still have
mo answer to that question, except
that it doesn't matter what you do
as long as you don't cheat by giving
someone aid ON an cAamination or
receiving Ht yourself

Probably some comments about
examinations do not give any aid
they would not be a violation of the
Honor System. This must be decided
on an individual basis, We all have
to make a special effort, however,
not to give information on the exam
to a student who has not taken the
same exam, It creates a predicament
for everyone involved

The easiest policy m to heep Our
mouths completely shut. Another
reason for this is that, although some
hall comments on examinations
may not be Honor Violations, they
nay cause the Independent Exam
program to be dropped. The faculty
understandably, would prefer thal no
comments whatsoever be made
about the finals

Keeping silent will work to insure
nivaniage of whe
cxaminations. For

ihat we keep the
wling our own
this reason, the BC encourages su
dents to make no comments ai all
shout final examinations. But wheth

The Department of English has
announced April 26 as the deadline
for submitting entries for this year’s
Mahan Awards in Creative Writing.
The contest is open to all freshmen,
sophomores, and juniors at Wash-
ington and Lee.

The Mahan Awards are endowed
by a trust established in 1936 by the

bal, Mo., a Lee scholar at WAL. Re-
cipients of the awards receive $100
tuition or $60 cash.

Entries may be submitted in one
or more of four categories: fresh
man, sophomore, and junior prose,
and poetry. The total awards in any
one year may not exceed five, and
awards are made only when the en-
tries achieve a level of excellence re
quired by a committee of judges in
the Department of English.

Further details and instructions

Applicants for any one of these
five positions should plan to appear
in person before the Publications
Board. They should mail their ap-
plications to John McCardell, Publi-
cations Board Secretary, at either
Box 221 or the Lambda Ohi Alpha
fraternity house in Lexington.

Applications will not be accepted
after 6 p.m. Monday, April 26. Ap-
plications should inchide:

—A brief letter of intent stating
your name and the position for
which you intend to apply.

—Ten copies of a personal resume
containing academic and extra-cur-
ricular data (including GPR), and
pertinent employment experience (if
any) on W&L publications. These
resumes should be in outline form

and should not inchide plans,
thoughts, ideas, or proposals, which
are to be presented to the Board in
person.

The required personal appearances
before the Board are expected to be
brief and relevant. Presentations, at
the option of the applicant, may be
accomplished by written outlines of
plans, thoughts, ideas, and proposals.
If this is done—and it usually is—
the applicant should bring ten copies
of this material to the election.

Bookstore Will Present Boyden;
Photos By Goodridge On Exhibit

If you like to listen to folksongs
over a warm cup of coffee, or if you
prefer to browse through a collec-
tion of photographs, the fare on
campus is excellent this week.

Tonight in the Bookstore, Beedle
Boyden, a sophomore at Hollins,
will sing folksongs—some of which
are outs on her two albums which
will be released soon

Miss Boyden taught herself to
play the guitar and picked up songs
as she went along, many of which
she has played for area groups

The gathering at the Bookstore

will be “sit-on-the4loor,” according
to its manager, Mrs. Betty Munger.

Room 112 of the University Cen-
ter will be open throughout this
week. Of course, that is nothing ex-
ceptional, except for the exhibit of
photography on display.

Jim Goodridge’s show is a study
of natural scenes, many of which are
of the Lexington area. The display is
a first for Goodridge, a senior from
Fairfield, Conn. whose major is art
history

His exhibit will be open for brows
ing through the first of next week

In an attempt to channel interest-
ed students into community activi-
ties during the spring term the Uni-
versity Federation has begun a re-
cruitment drive. There has long been
a lack of communication and under-
standing between the university and
the community, with each side su-
spect of the other. A major purpose
of these programs, thus, is to im-
prove relations between the com-
munity and the school and through
mutual cooperation to better meet
some of the needs of the area.

Two programs already in exis-
tence are the Western State weekly
visits and the Big Brother Program,
co-sponsored with the county proba-
tion department. Every week stu-
dents travel to Western State Mental
Hospital to visit the patients and
help them in any way they can. Per-
haps the most successful attempt at
coordination between the school and
the county to date is the Big Brother
Program. Originally the program
was aimed at poverty level, jeuvenile
delinquents, but due to the response
from the student body (far more
than anyone had originally hoped
for) the program is currently being
expanded through the county wel-
fare department. Hence, even more
students will be needed.

Iwo other programs that are cur-
rently being organized are the hous-
ing repair group and the physically
handicapped children’s program.
Over one third of the housing in
Rockbridge County is in dilapidated
condition. The purpose of the hous-
ing repair group is to help make
some of these homes more liveable
through minor repair of them. This
program will be run with the assis-
tance of the county welfare depart-
ment. It is envphasized that one does
not need prior carpentry experience
to work with the group. Due to the
expanse of the county and the lack
of available transportation, the phy-
sically handicapped children of the
county often become isolated. The
purpose of this program is to help
these children get back into the com
munity and by working with them
to develop their individual talents

For all students interested in any
of the above programs there will be
a meeting on Thursday, March 25 at
7:00 in Room 208 in the Student
Center. If you are interested, but
cannot attend this meeting, call Bob
Foley (463-6268)

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
March 24, 1971

The Executive Committee:
On The Road Back

After its March 15 meeting, the Executive Committee
finally put its collective finger back on the pulse of the Honor
System. To the right is the text of their memo to the faculty
regarding the change in the pledge’s wording on the front of
the envelope. The usual pledge will now be used during the
exam period.

We felt that this move was the wisest possible course lor
that body to take in the first place, instead of the brief tangle
in words which clouded the issue of the future of the Honor
System, not to mention the future of independent exams.

" We urge each student to read the text of that memo, keep-
ing in mind that it stands as a guideline from the EC regarding
the Honor System during the independent examination period.

W&L’s Do-It-Yourself
Wallpaper Men

Usually an editor writes “don’t walk on the grass” or
“more paperbacks, please” editorials when he’s run out of
topics to fill up this column. :

We haven't. However, we cannot let this endless series ot
elections pass by without commenting upon what we feel is
one of the most absurd manifestations of election time at
W&L: the posters.

Each spring the buildings on campus are wallpapered with
all sorts of brightly colored sheets of paper, all looking curi-
ously the same. This spring has been no different except for
those industrious few who have taken upon themselves the
task of papering each building with large white sheets of paper
which are no doubt more effective advertising, but are just as
effectively absurd.

Whether or not one agrees that W&L's campus is hand-
some is not really a point for dispute. But we think no building
has much to offer in the way of aesthetics if its walls are blott-
ed with posters. Each one looks like an adolescent with a bad
skin problem. Is this what the admissions office wants pro-
spective students to view when they visit the campus in the
spring? We doubt it.

Some may argue that these posters are necessary to keep
the student body election-minded. Perhaps so. But if one looks
objectively at the impression those posters create, he probably
would conclude that close to half the school was on a campaign
to promote pollution or their egos.

Several months ago Fran Lawrence made a few remarks
on the trampling of the grass on campus. This is a lost cause
as far as we can see, although a valiant effort is being made
by the groundsmen to patch together the back campus. So
now students will walk on the straw.

Walking on the grass seems to have become a tradition
here: we don’t see how the EC is going to do away with that
one. But Fran Lawrence and the Executive Committee could
ban the posters.

In place of the posters (which, by the way, we think are an
ineffectual means of candidate promotion at best), we sug-
gest that the EC make provision for boards about campus
upon which the names of the candidates could be listed along
with their real qualifications—instead of the oftused promo
tags of “experience” or “leadership.” Candidates would be
able to distribute letters or other printed handouts to the stu-
dents which outlined their platforms and their desires.

As far as keeping the student body election-minded, The
Ring-tum Phi seems to serve that purpose. When possible
(and it almost always is possible) the newspaper prints a
slate of the candidates for each office in an election.

Apart from all considerations of aesthetics, we think the
concept of posters is immature. We suppose it’s one of the
grand American traditions to advertise one’s name in an elec-
tion. But the way which W&L candidates have gone about
supporting that tradition is high schoolish,

We think the EC ought to do away with the posters, Next
vear’s election should be controlled by the Executive Commit
tee so that posters on buildings will be at least one tradition
the EC did away with that won't be missed.

“The Student Executive Com-
mittee appreciates your patience
and understanding in the follow-
ing matter. In its meeting Mon-
day night (March 15) the Execu-
tive Committee passed over-
whelmingly (nine to one) a reso-

lution including the following
statement:

“Students should disregard the
pledge as printed on the outside
of the Independent Examination
envelope. Instead, the EC re-
quests that the usual pledge on
written work be used in its place:
“On my honor as a Washington
and Lee gentleman, I pledge that
I have neither given nor received
aid on this examination.” ’

“The resolution also reminds
students that final examinations
are given to more than one sec-
tion, and therefore should be
considered “hot” throughout the
examination period. In addition,
the Executive Committee reminds
students that all work submitted
for a grade is considered under
the Honor System, regardless of
how the pledge is worded or
whether it is omitted.

“Our decision is based upon
careful examination of the pledge
on the Independent Exam envel-
Ope over the past several weeks.
In our discussion with the Fac-
ulty EC we found that many of
the problems of interpretation
arose from the technical and le-
galistic nature of that pledge.

“The present examination
pledge tends to legalize and codi-
fy the Honor System and there-

 

Text Of The Executive Committee’s
Memo To The Faculty

fore is incompatable with the
basic and simple concept that a
Washington and Lee man does
not lie, cheat or steal.

“Possible violations of this
code must be dealt with on an in-
dividual basis. The EC believes
that the present pledge on the
exam envelope tends to restrict
individual judgment on the part
of students and the basic inter-
pretive powers of the EC in mat-
ters pertaining to Honor,

“It is for these reasons that we
delete the printed pledge on the
envelope, and substitute the tra-
ditional pledge. The special na-
ture of final examinations (that
they are not cold) has been, and
will continue to be, impressed
upon the student body as well as
the fact that it is living under an
Honor System not a_ specific
pledge, that requires students to
refrain from giving or receiving
information on academic work.

“We realize that this resolution
may cause some confusion on the
part of students and faculty. We
apologize for this inconvenience
and will take the following steps
to inform the University of these
changes.

1. Explanations cards to be dis-
tributed with the examination.

2. A similar explanation posted
across campus.

3. Articles in
Phi.

4. An EC manned information
table.

We thank you for your pati-
ence and hope for your coopera-
tion.

Letters
To the Editor

Welfare: ‘Very Tiresome’

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

How tiresome—the second Ring-
tum Phi article in as many weeks
on poverty and welfare and who-
knows-what-all. Or rather, how very
tiresome. Another legacy of the elec-
tion campaign of 1960.

Will today’s students believe, or
can they imagine, that in the Fifties
we weren't Obsessed with “the poor?”
But then perhaps each decade gets
the fad it deserves.

So “let ‘em eat cake,” as the queen
didn’t really say, but should have.
The point was elaborated more ele-
gantly later on by the greatest wit of
the nineteenth century, whose sound
advice might well be directed to our
own terribly serious, terribly “com-
mitted,” and terribly “concerned”
young zealots of “social justice” or
whatever.

“Realize,” he said, “your youth
while you have it. Don’t squander the
gold of your days, listening to the
tedious, trying to improve the hope-
less failure, or giving away your life
to the ignorant, the common, and
the vulgar.

“These are the sickly aims, the
faise modern sympathy with pain.
One should sympathize with the
color, the beauty, the joy of life.
The less said about life’s sores the
better... . |Our] century has gone
bankrupt through an over-expendi
ture of sympathy.”

Dance Board Needs Fee

lo the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Your editorial on the Dance Board
was well stated. | was especially
happy to note your treatment of criti
cism of an entertainment fee. If
anyone still has dowbts about the
justifications for such a fee, please
count the number of Giee Club con
certs, Troub productions, or debate
tournaments you have attended this
year.

These three organizations are
funded by the Student Activities Fee,
and rightly so. The source of the
SAF is cach student's tuition, A per
centage is given each year to the
EC for disbursement to the various
groups listed in Article LX, Section
B. 2

During the recent Constitutional
Convention, | proposed that the
Dance Board be added to the list of
groups receiving money from the
SAF. The motion was defeated be
couse of doubts expressed as to
whether the new constitution would
be accepted with it inchided, (As we
now have witnessed, the content of
the proposed constitution was of

little matter.)
Nevertheless, | still stand behind
the argumem that if other student

orgnizations are subsidized through
mandatory contributions, whether it
be a required fee (Contact) or thro
ugh the SAF, the Dance Board
should receive the same treatment
It then could serve all of the student

Exam Pledge ‘Mint-Crisis’ Dies;
Deadlock Broken With Pledge

BY DOUG BURTON

What appears to have been a tech-
nical snag in the system here has
grown into a mini-crisis threatening
the future of independent examina-
tions.

The problem arose after a poll last
year indicated that perhaps 75% of
the students taking final exams under
the IE schedule had heard comments
on the order of “value” judgments
and that 11% had heard comments
on test questions.

Were the wholesale violations evi-
dence of widespread contempt for
the honor system? Most students and
faculty agree with Fran Lawrence
that the stated pledge was misunder-
stood by most students. This is sug-
gested by the fact that 93% of the
people polled on the honor system
noted that they were under no un-
usual strain in relation to the honor
system.

[he question remaining in the
minds of many professors is wheth-
er or not the efficacy of exams are
not compromised when the pledge is
so misunderstood. The Executive
Committee of the faculty decided a
couple of weeks ago to bring the
matter to the faculty at large.

Dr. Robert McAhren, who says
he has more faith than anybody in
the honor of W&L gentleman, draft-
ed at that time a new pledge for this
term’s exam envelopes which includ-
ed the following clause, “I under-
stand that I (am obligated) to avoid
even the most general communica-
tions touching upon this examina-
tion’s difficulty, length, or other
characteristics.”

It was rejected by the EC,

Members of the Faculty EC are
quick to tell you that they have noth-
ing to do with the exam pledge or
with honor violations. The instru-
mentality of the pledge is of great
importance to them, however, since
they alone will bring the matter of
independent examinations before the
faculty, and in fact, have the author-
ity to abolish the LE schedule them-
selves.

Student Body President Fran Law-
rence and the EC have now gone
back to the traditional W&L pledge.
For the text of an explanatory memo
to the faculty, see the box on this
page.) He had this to say on the
spirit of General Lee’s dictum in
1971;

“What we have discovered recent-
ly is that the faculty know damn
little about what the honor system
means.

“It is really very sinyple. The basis
of the honor system is that a Wash-
ington and Lee man does not lie,
cheat or steal. Within this context a
person can say all kinds of things
about a test and not reveal informa-
tion. The three part pledge tended to
codify and place limits on what a
student could and could not do,
leaving him no room for personal
judgment.

“The honor system works on a
mystical basis, finally, but it works.
There is no scientific basis for deter-
mining what is cheating and what
isn’t. Unfortunately most faculty are
academicians enough to see every
thing in terms of black and white.”

 

To many alumni, Washington and Lee means “fraternity,” but in the past three years, the fraternity system at
WAL has been weakened by the depletion in membership rolls. The Kappa Sigma chapter here was no exception.

Are Fraternities “Essential” At W6L?

BY SKIP PAUKERI
“A lot of people have changed
that certain kind of person is appeat
ing in fewer numbers each year, and
many students no longer believe
that the fraternities provide the es
sential services of student life

With these words, Steve Robinson
incoming President of the Student
Body and a house president, out

lined the dilemma facing the greek

system at W&l
The folding of two houses in the
past year and the potential failure of
perhaps one or two additional fra
ternities in the near future is obvious
testament to the that the

I am a free man. I have no plans
to ‘be ever anything ‘but a free man,

there is no worse fate, than to find
ourselves enslaved in spite of our

Letters
To th Editor

The Dance Board Fee
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

At the risk of being accused of
caring what goes on in this school,
1 would like to comment on your
proposed social fee.

You draw a parallel between your
proposed tax and the Contact fee
which I don’t think is entirely valid.
First of all, the effect of the Contact
fee is minimal while a $25 to $30
social fee would bode ill for many
a pocketbook. Secondly, Contact
and other functions under the acti-
vities fee, with the possible excep-
tion of the conypulsory nostalgia of
The Calyx, are in some way educa-
tional in nature; dances are not.

But even if the both arguments
above were completely untrue, I
dislike the premises of your argu-
ment. You are saying that since con-
cert-goers seem unwilling to give un-
qualified support to the Dance Board,
that support must be forced from
them and from their fellow students
who have no interests in such non-
essential, but pleasureable, activities.

The solution is to quit selling tic-
kets at the door. Then those inter-
ested in concerts could cast their $40
Dance Plan votes. If not enough
money is gathered, a refund could
be made.

Imagine the reaction of students
if, given the situation above, The
Ring-tum Phi suggested, “People do
not seem to want to support the
Dance Board, therefore everyone
should ‘be forced to buy what they
have shown they don’t want.” Any-
way you throw the dice (returning
to your gambling analogy), the con-
cert-goers win and the non-attenders
lose. The Dance Board may be gam-
bling but it certainly has better odds
than you are offering us. I'd just as
soon you pay for your own enter-
tainment, thank you.

| A Vote For Freedom

 

rkly...

own abilities and reduced to impri-
sonment although we have the means
—but not the desire—to free our-
selves. And yet the tremendous and
overwhelming power of the central
authorities in Washington, the less
efficient ‘but no less pre-possessing
state governments, and even the local
communities, have erected a power
structure that stifles liberty and
replaces the freedom of the indivi-
dual with the repressive security of
the state.

We have the means to throw off
these bonds that fetter our liberty,
yet we as a nation prefer the shame
of slavery to the maturity of free-
dom. We have many remnants of
our lost rights, but these are not the
kernel of individual liberty that once
brought our parents over 3,000 miles
to escape the despotism of the past.

I can condemn the authoritarian
statism of the central government—
this is a remnant of freedom of the
press. Yet I still am forced to pay
the exorbitant taxes the government
demands from me, I still am regu-
lated in the food I eat, in the cars J
drive, and in the clothes I wear.

I still am controlled in a manner
that is appalling to any person who
desires liberty and finds freedom
the most precious part of life. We
are bent, stamped, and mutilated; we
are ordered, forbidden, and directed;
we are deprived of our most basic
rights while the government pena-
lizes the successful and succors the
incompetent from the just result of
their incompetency.

In short, we no longer are free
men, but are the creatures of a state
both omniscient and omnipotent,
whose interests are paramount and
who tramples the rights of the many
for the sake of its own existence.

In spite of this governmental pre-
ponderance, there is still a measure
of hope for free Americans. Our
most important right—that of the
‘ballot—has been the last one the
statists have dared to tamper with,
and it is still in our power to vote out
those centralizing politicoes who
have tried so successfully to destroy
the individual liberties of free citi-
zens.

The realization of our encroach-
ing slavery and the knowledge that
we may by a joint effort remove
these obnoxious fetters, are the only
road we have toward a restoration
of freedom: the effort may well be
in vain at this late date, but we can
only wager all that we have in hope
of returning to free agents the liber-
ties of our heritage.

BY JEFFREY B. SPENCE

It is always interesting to watch
the varied machinations of both the
left and the right wings as they go
about their programs for the salva-
tion of America. It seems like every-
body has a ready-made solution for
the ills that beset us. Unfortun-
ately most of these solutions end in
creating more problems. What is
more interesting are the basic incon-
gruities that tend to get entangled
with the high ideals of the onganiza-
tions on both ends of the political
spectrum,

One of the incongruities 1 speak
of concerns the attitude that these
groups have towards government in-
tervention into the lives of the citi-
zenry. It appears as if both sides op-
pose it. The right wing does not want
intervention into the private enter-
prise sector on such programs as wel-
fare. Yet, this same group of rugged
individualists wants our country to
spend ever greater amounts of
money so that a central government
(the state) will be able to defend us
from all the evil communists.

Washington and Lee Passes
Century Since Name-Change

One hundred years ago last week,
Washington College in Lexington
took for itself a new name. It was
on March 16, 1871, that the little
school’s trustees officially authorized
the change from “Washington Col-
lege” to “Washington and Lee Uni-
versity.”

Lee had died on campus on Octo-
ber 12, 1870. On the day that he
was buried in the small chapel that

bears his name and that has since be-
come a national shrine, the college's
faculty had resolved to petition the
Virginia legislature for permission
to rename the school.

They reasoned that “the name of
this institution may hereafter ever
express in fit conjunction the im-
mortal names of Washington and
Lee whose lives were so similar in
their perfect renown and with both

of whom equally, by singular good
fortune, it is entitled to be associat-
ed in its future history.”

According to the late Dr. Ollin-
ger Crenshaw, in his history, Gen-
eral Lee’s College, the Virginia Gaz-
ette was quick to endorse the change
of name, along with the appointment
of Lee’s son Custis to the presi-
denoy. The paper reasoned that Lee,
more than anyone else had been re-
sponsible for the growth of college
into University.

Lee had attracted an outstanding
faculty to the college with his arri-
val, and had also leant his own per-
sonal reputation to recruit top stu-
dents, not only from the south, but
from throughout a country that had
been torn apart by war.

New programs in education were
also sponsored by the general turned
university president. Lee added the
law school division, along with a
schoo! of engineering to blend with
the school’s traditional liberal arts
curriculum. Lee first conceived of
an undergraduate business school,
and it was under his guidance that

With Malice Toward Some
Government Steps In

 
   

The left wing wants the ever-
reaching power of the central gov-
ernment to stop all its intervention
militarily, in both foreign and do-
mestic affairs. Yet, they want that
very same government to spend
large amounts of money on an ever-
growing welfare program. It is get-
ting difficult to know what these
politicos want. Do they want more
or less government? It seems like
they do not know what they want.

Unfortunately, the left wing has
ibrought one of their incongruities
into our campus community and it
has presented us with a very serious
situation. The left has recently been
very upset by the invasion of the
government's military organization
on to our private campus. Their dis-
tress has been made known through
their efforts to remove the credit
from R.O.T.C. and maybe remove
the entire program. This is a most
laudable effort. | wonder why they
then turn around and entice another
military agency of the government
on campus. This agency is the state
police force of Virginia, particularly
their narcotics division. The police
are being enticed by the ever-in-
creasing use and sale of illegal drugs.

I blame this on the left for some
specific reasons. They tend to be the
group both locally and on a national
scale who are the largest users and
dealers in the drug scene.

It seems to me that if these people
want to avoid intervention by the
“pigs” they would not carry on acti-
vities that could easily bring them
into our campus life. The university
that we attend is not and does not
consider itself to be a sanctuary
from the law. Therefore there is no
reason why anyone who attends
W&L should dare consider it to be a
safe place.

Gentlemen, believe me, the cops
are interested in what is happening
in the W&L drug scene. If the acti-
vities of those who believe drug use
to be their salvation do not cease
soon we can expect the possibility of
police intervention and investigation
to become a very real one. If “off the
pigs” is what you subscribe to or for
that matter a lesser version of the
same political line, then I ask you to
take stock of what you are doing: if
drugs are your thing. If and when the
bust comes please do not try and
create some moral upheaval then be-
cause it would only be ludicrous. In-
stead either cut down or cut out the
use of drugs altogether or else go to
work to change the law. Until the
law does change the “pigs” are going
to try and bust you. Peace.

Last weekend, however, Spring-

In closing out what was possibly
the most stellar career in W&L
swimming history, Senior Captain
Bill “Smack” Brumback, upstaged
his All American feats of last year.

As has been the case for the last
two seasons, he gained All-Ameri-
can status for his performance in his
speciality, the 50 yard freestyle. In
addition, Smack this year also placed
for All American honors in the 100
yard freestyle, setting a new W&L
record in the process,

Coach Bill Stearns was under-
standably proud of the Baltimore
Bullet. He observed it was a fitting

minger, will act as a firm foundation
for a much improved mile relay

Workhorses Paul Wilbur and Bob

With this added dimension of
depth and enthusiasm, W&L track-
sters should enjoy an extremely suc-
cessful season, Our harriers should

significance, should also serve no-

After some of the turnabouts last
week, I’m really shaky about trying
to pick some winners in the NCAA
basketball finals. But with only three
games—the most crucial—left, I
might as well try.

The Villanova-Western Kentucky
match is just as hard to choose as
UCLA-Kansas. The Philadelphia-
based Wildcats first shocked Ford-
ham and then sent rival Penn reel-
ing with the gargantuan 43 point vic-
tory. The great thing that Villanova
has going for it is momentum. En-
joying their first appearance as an
NOAA finalist since 1939, the Wild-
cats only suit nine players.

Performance-wise, Western Ken-
tucky may be superior, but Villan-
ova’s Howard Porter is as hot as a
six-bit pistol. Western Kentucky,
though, has demonstrated its strength
with convincing victories over Ken-
tucky and Ohio State, the latter in
overtime. The Hilltoppers themselves
boast hot-shooting Jim McDaniel.

In the other big games, Kansas,
with memories of a national title in
1952 still rebounding in its head,
challenges a UCLA dynasty which
has lately been equated with the
New York Yankees of the 1950's.

Doremus To Host NCAA Swimming

that W&L swimming owes its tre-

NCAA Basketball Predictions

Curiously, neither team was over-
ly impressive in regional action. The
Jayhawks beat Houston by one and
Drake by only a little more on the
way to Dome; meanwhile, the
Bruins, supposedly resting up for
the big ones, were last minute victors
over Long Beach State.

Next Saturday should find Wes-
tern Kentucky ‘battling UCLA for
the NCAA championship. In the
past, Bruin championships have been
as certain as death and taxes, But
Western will end this Bruin streak at
four.

And for those of you who braved
the snow to come see the W&L base-
ballers’ openers last Saturday, only
to find no one on the field, we thank
you, The cold weather and precipita-
tion from the night before forced
the cancellation of a scheduled dou-
bleheader with Long Island Univer-
sity.

Instead, our diamond crew played
a scrimmage game with LIU at VMI
Sunday, with better weather. The
Generals had opened the season with
St. Francis, winning the first game
while dropping the nightcap. And
thanks, too, to a good crowd that
showed up for those games.

Lacrosse Team Takes Two

Randolph-Macon
English All-Stars
Felled By Generals

BY RAY SWAN

The W&L Lacrosse team started
the season with two wins this week,
defeating Randolph-Macon 14-8, and
the English All-Stars 13-11.

Saturday’s game against R-M saw
the Yellow Jackets jump to a 3-1
lead in the first quarter. Hank Slaus-
son scored the General's lone goal
in the period.

In the second quarter, W&L ex-
ploded for five goals in six minutes
by Whit Morrill, John Lalley, Ted
Bauer, and two by Sam Englehart.
R-M retaliated with three goals in
the quarter to knot the score 6-6 at
halftime.

Three minutes into the third quar-
ter, Englehart broke the tie. Whit
Morrill and Ed Tognetti scored and
Englehart added another. R-M scor-
ed in the final minute of the quarter
to give the Blue a 10-7 lead.

Englehart again opened the scor-
ing in the fourth quarter but the
Yellow Jackets came back two min-
utes later with a goal, making the
score 11-8, Chip Tompkins, Bob
Brumback and Jim Farrar each scor-
ed to clinch the game for the Gen-
erals.

Sam Englehart led all scorers with
five goals. Scott Neese chalked up
five assists. Skeeter Chadwick started

Split Doubleheader

Behind the strong pitching perfor

Fitzhugh, a junior transfer stu
dent whose older brother was also a
standout for the Generals, went the
entire first game, allowing only three
hits and striking out ten. Although
the General hitting attack was weak,
they did score two unearned runs in
the third. Two walks and an infield
hit by Freshman Jerry Johnson
loaded the bases

The St. Francis pitcher then pro
ceeded to walk Fitzhugh and Bo

In the second game, the failure to
take advantage of numerous oppor
tunities was the Generals’ downfall
Ellie Gutshall started for WA&l
pitching 5 innings, allowing all the
runs on three hits and five walks.
All of the runs were unearned

Don McMillan came on in relief
ind pitched two perfect innings. The
Generals’ lone score came on a bases
loaded single in the sixth. One run
on that base hit was disallowed due
to an umpire’s ruling that third base
had not been touched

Four Veterans

Lead Golfers
This Season

Four veteran golfers will form the
nucleus for the 1971 Washington
and Lee University golf team which
faces a much tougher schedule this
spring.

The quartet is led by senior cap-
tain Ken Carter of New Orleans,
now beginning his fourth year on
the varsity. “If I had six Ken Car-
ters, we would do pretty well with
this schedule,” commented veteran
W&L golf coach E. P. (Cy) Twomb-
ly.

Carter will be joined by lettermen
Jack Marquess, Bill Martin and
Brandon Herbert. After that, three
non-lettermen and a raft of fresh-
men candidates are competing for
the remaining places on the team.

The non-lettermen are soph Phil
Milner, the no. 7 man last year;
Craig Williams, who didn’t play last
year but has shown steady improve-
ment; and Nim Long, a sophomore
transfer from Sewanee, where he
played no. 7 on the strong Tiger
team.

The Generals will open April 12
at Duke, one of four Atlantic Coast
Conference opponents on the cight-
match schedule. The others are
North Carolina, N. C. State and Vir-
ginia.

W&L Celebrates 100th Birthday

(Continued from Page 3)

Washington College became the site
of the first college journalism pro-
gram,

Few observers could probably pre-
dict such academic success when
Lee arrived at the college in 1865
Indeed, his very salary was being
paid with borrowed funds, a humble
$1500 for the first year. The little
school itself was poverty-stricken,
and, as Dr, Crenshaw points out,
the employment of military men in
higher education was, at that time,
rare. The presence of the former
Confederate general as an influence
on college students was also attack-
ed by some Northern newspapers
and politicians.

Foreseeing such criticism and
fearing that it might be deeply in-
jurious to Washington College, Lee
debated at length whether to accept
the position. Fittingly, in view of
the school’s eventual title, Washing-
ton’s life and service to country had
always been an abiding influence in
Lee’s own life. It is said that the

connection between the first Ameri-
can hero, who in 1798 had saved
the institution from extinction with
a $50,000 endowment, and the
school itself helped persuade Lee to
accept the presidency.

Perhaps the most enduring of his
contributions were those that were
intangible in nature. An overriding
precept was to foster reconciliation
between sections of the country, to
eradicate bitter feeling. It was under
Lee’s administration that the college
first became a national institution of
learning, represented ‘by students
from throughout the country.

In his personal conduct, and in his
aspirations for “his boys” at Wash-
ington College, nothing was more
important than expanding the capa-
city and desire of men to learn, to
understand, and to pass to the future
the fruits of this growth—all in an
atmosphere of individual integrity,
honor and responsibility.

That too endures today as a legacy
from Lee at the university which
was dead when he came to it and
which he made to live.

Are Fraternities ‘‘Essential’’ At W@L?

(Continued from Page 2)
look at campus life.

“I think this could re-vitalize fra-
ternities,” said Murov. “If our plan
is instrumented rush will be de-for-
malized so that, upon invitation a
freshman can come out to the house
at any time and could discuss any-
thing with an upperclassmen, out-
side McCormick Library and his
dorm room.”

But even if this new rush plan is
a smashing success, it may not be
enough to stay the anti-fraternity
course. The IFC statistics on current
membership indicate a serious drop-
out rate among upperclassman, and
this may be even more causal to fra-
ternity troubles.

“Fraternities must adapt to a
changing student body,” said La-
Rue.” Any system that can’t change
is a dinasour and will necessarily be-
come extinct.” LaRue pointed to the
food-buying plan initiated this year
iby the IFC as a step in the right di-
rection of cutting costs and provid-
ing better services. The effort this
year was, however, somewhat abor-
tive: the IFC complains of a lack of
co-operation on the part of some
houses and general community boy-
cotts by local merchants made the
implementation difficult.

“We're convinced that money can
be saved on some commodities,” ar-
gues LaRue. “Just about any system
would be an improvememt over the
present procedure of individual buy-
ing.”

Outgoing president of the IFC,
Doug Gossmann, hopes that frater-
nities might be able to cut costs by
sharing combos, “A big problem is
that many fraternities still want to
maintain their social autonomy and
this just isn’t practical,” he said.

Steve Robinson sees the problem
of social style closely-related to fra-
ternity survival. “Lots of houses

have parties just once a month, and

a freshman or upperclassman just
can't see sacrificing that new car for
simply one combo a month. Besides,
students are becoming more bored
with the traditional combo style.” A
strong fraternity will probably be
one that branches out with imagina-
tive alternatives,

It is also hoped, that under new
arrangements with a local account-
ing agent, fraternities will produce
better-managed books next year and
hopefully save wasted expenses by
stricter regulation of finances.

There is some question as to
whether there is really a serious hos-
tility between some students and
faculty members and the fraternity
system. “I think that the fraternity
remains basically attractive,” says
Gossmann. “And I think people ima-
gine more hostility than there really
is.” But Tom Mays, a former fra-
ternity man and a sophomore repre-
sentative on the EC disagrees: “Many
independents feel that they were
fooled when they went through rush,
and they feel lucky that they got out,
so that they will really close ranks
and tell freshmen what they think.”

Mays sees eventually a fraternity
membership at W&L levelling off at
about 30-35%, with a situation
roughly parallel to the status quo at
U.Va. now. “I think with fewer
houses on campus, being in a frater-
nity will, in fact, mean a regain of
identity between houses.”

In fact, as certain houses seem to
lose strength, no one seems really to
be weeping over the plight of the
system. Most fraternity leaders will
admit, matter-offactly, that if fra-
ternities have no function on camp-
us, then there is no reason for them
to remain. And most of them will
hasten to point out that the strong
houses will most certainly survive
for quite a while, preserving the cen-
tury—old tradition of fraternity life.

One encouraging fact for frater-
nities is that the IFC has seen greatly
improved leadership this year over
past times, and LaRue adds, “the
IFC has made tremendous strides
over their past image, embarking on
certain programs which were avoid-
ed in the past and attempting to im-
plement them in a somewhat more
mature manner. | know the faculty
and administration see this, and I
hope that they will recognize the ef-
forts that we're making.”

Steve Robinson seemed to sum up
the viewpoint of the fraternity ele-
ment, which has become increasing-
ly realistic and pragmatic in tone.
“As we draw more students to W&L
from more variam backgrounds, it
would be unfair to force the frater-
nity system on the incoming fresh-
men. A lot has been done for fra-
ternities by alumni and the brother-
hood, and its up to us now to decide
whether fraternities, and which fra-
ternities, are worth it... The strong
houses will survive and should offer
students an attractive economic al-
ternative in the future.”

The perennial complaint about the
Dance Board has concerned the
quality of entertainment. Good en-
tertainment necessitates very early
bookings in order to obtain the low-
est possible prices. To do this the
Dance Board must know far in ad-
vance its budget for the next year.

Or, it must hold money in reserve
to guarantee a good Openings con-
cert so that it can sell dance plans.
Both the fixed fee idea of Student
Activities Fee funding would solve
this problem and eliminate the “riv
erboat gambling.”

(Continued from Page 1)

For senior class president, Bo
Brookby and Bert Meem must re-
face balloting tomorrow, Cliff Over-
cash and Beau Dudley will compete
for sophomore class vice president.

Also to be elected on Thursday's
ballot are the vice-presidents of the
Arts, Sciences, and Commerce
Schools, since there was some con-
fusion Monday about who should
vote for those offices. The polls will
close tomorrow at 5 p.m.

On Monday members of the stu-
dent delegation to the University
Council will be elected by a plurality
of votes cast. There will be four
positions to be filled by seniors, three
by juniors, two by sophomores, and
one by a freshman.

The deadline for petitions for Uni-
versity Council was extended to Fri-
day, March 26 at 5 p.m. in the EC
room.

The following students have sub-
mitted complete petitions at this
time for University Council race:
seniors: Bob Carrere, Steve Ory,
Don Weir, Terry Tyler, Everett
Newman, Bruce Madison, Bill An-
drews, and Mare Small; juniors Rob
Dwelley, Bill Merchant; sopho-
mores: Lewis Powell, Ted Amschoff,
Duncan Klinedinst, Paul Hartmann,

I am very upset that the complete
election returns for the elections last
week were not posted. In both the
Monday and Thursday elections, |
wrote in Patrick MecGroin for the
position of Vice-President, for 1 felt
that he, more than either of the other
candidates, represented my true feel-
ings on the present student govern-
ment at Washington and Lee.
Recent editorials have complained
that there is too much apathy on the
part of the Washington and Lee stu-
dent body. How can I not be apathe-
tic, if complete election returns (as
in previous years) are not posted?
