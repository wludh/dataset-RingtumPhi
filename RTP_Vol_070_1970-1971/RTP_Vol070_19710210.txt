On Courses

By BRUCE P, MADISON

Student Representative on Courses
and Degrees Committee

The Courses and Degrees Com-
mittee had been a faculty committee
dealing with academic affairs until
earlier this year. At that time a
student position was created on the
committee. It was my privilege to
be selected by the Executive Com-
mittee to serve in this position.
While the committee still is, to a
cenain degree, under the jurisdic
tion of the faculty, | was granted
full voting privileges. It was deem-
ed inyportant that a committee deal-
ing almost entirely in student affairs
should have a full student member.

According to Dean Pusey, the
primary philosophy of the commét-
tee is that it serves as a body to
which students can petition con-
cerning requests they might have in
academic affairs. The two major
areas of these requests are for
clarification of items covered in
the “Washington and Lee University
Bulletin” and for exceptions to
faculty rules. Another major area of
Courses and Degrees Committee
business is concerned with recom-
mendations to the faculty on sug-
gesied new and revised courses.
These recommendations are later
voted on by the faculty.

This last category of responsi-
bility may seem a direct parallel to
the Faculty Ourriculum Committee.
This committee is an ad hoc com-
mittee created by the faculty for
investigation into new areas of cur-
riculum. Thus, while there is some
overlapping, Dean Pusey notes that
this is the case in many areas of
University government.

Ihe committee meets every Tues-
day. Other members of the body
besides Dean Pusey and myself are
Dean Atwood, Dr. W. Barrett, Dr.
Coulling, Dr. Griffith, Col. Head,
who serves as the secretary, Dr.
Hinton, Dr. Jenks, and Dr. Wise.

Typical requests are from students
requesting an overload or under-
load of hours during a semester. All
independemt majors are required to
have the course selections approved
iby the committee. Of specific con-
cern in the past several weeks has
been the approval of new Honors
Programs in the various depart-
ments. The faculty drew up the gen-
eral guidelines and directed the
Courses and Degrees Committee to
examine and approve the specifics.

In the initial discussion concern-
ing plans for the upcoming Consti-
tutional Convention, Glenn Azuma
suggested that the EC reconsider its
previous action of appointing itself
as ex Officio delegates. Sophomore
representative Tom Mays agreed,
saying that there was a considerable
student feedback concerning the
propriety of the EC “voting our-
selves into office.”

Student Body President Fran
Lawrence objected, pointing out that
there would be 38 other delegates
chosen by petition last week, suffici-
em numbers to “broaden the base
of representation to the convention.”

Vice President Phil Thompson
underscored Lawrence’s contention:
“I think it would be a mistake not to
include the EC ... it would, in
fact, be almost irresponsible for BC
members not to express their views
on such an important matter.”

In the second major order of
business, Baseball Coach Joseph
Lyles, representing the team cap-
tain, presented a request for funds
to defray the cost of air transporta-
tion for 20-22 ballplayers for the

Law Dean

One of the most important long-
range answers to the problems of
alienation, violence, and crime in
America involves educating the na-
tion's children to the inherently
positive values and iprocesses of the
governmental structure, according
to the final report of a Presidential
task force, headed by Washington
and Lee’s law dean, Prof. Roy L.
Steinheimer.

“If our children are provided suf-
ficiemt education and appropriate
democratic models in the home,
school, and communiy, as well as
an Opportunity to participate di-
rectly in democratic processes,” the
report contends, “they will want to
preserve our basic Constitutional
democracy as adults, (realizing) that
rational and orderly processes can
result in needed reforms.”

The report, completed this month,
is a refinement of an carly draft
presented in Decenvber before the
White House Conference on Chil-
dren. President Nixon had named

In New York Next Week

The Troubadour Theatre, has ac-
cepted an invitation to present its
current production “off-off” Broad-
way this month.

The Troubs will perform “Rosen-
crantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,”
the 1967 Tom Stoppard comedy, at
the Masterworks Laboratory Thea-
tre, East Second Street, Wednesday
through Friday evenings (Feb. 17-
19),

About 25 Trowbs will make the
trip, accompanied by Mrs. Ellen
Barnes, instructor in drama and di-
rector of the group.

The unique invitation to the
Froubadours was extended by Rich-
ard Moss, executive producer of the
theatre. Fred Cook, production man-
ager for Masterworks, had spent a
week last month working with the

Troubadours on “Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern,” and Mr. Moss said
Cook returned to New York with
“infectious enthusiasm” about the
Troub production.

The Executive Committee gave
the Troubadours $200 to help them
defray the cost of their trip to New
York, but the Troubs still need more
money in order to make their trip
a success. The organization requests
that all those interested in making
any contribution please contact the
theatre.

The Troubs will present “Rosen-
crantz and Guildenstern” in Lexing-
ton Feb. 9 through 13, just prior
to leaving for New York. They will
arrive in New York at the beginning
of the week, in order to have time

amining approaches to legal educa-
tion involving the nation’s young
children.

The 15 member committee noted
that the nation as a whole has
“failed to show children that the
democratic processes inherent in the
American Constitutional system can
help solve today’s most vital prob-
lems.”

“lf we do not demonstrate to
children that we can work within
(the system) to effect needed reforms
for all citizens, then we cannot ex-
pect children to make the necessary
commitment to the democratic prin-
ciples and ideals which support our
system.”

The Steinheimer committee's final
report pointed to research findings
that indicate children are able from
very early ages to understand the
meanings of “Law,” “justice,” and
“rules.” By the time they begin to
be taught formally about legal and
political order, they have long been
judging it.

The challenge, according to the
tusk force report, is to begin at much

 

earlier ages in children’s lives to pro-
vide them with appropriate prin-
ciples by which to make those judg-
ments,

Most young children, the report
continues, see rules in school, family
life, and similar local situations as
generally preventing disorder and
protecting social interaction—not as
punitive or coercive.

A systematized, comprehensive
design for providing small children
with practical experience in demo-
cratic situations and with a personal
understanding of the value of demo-
cracy must be applied to children
from the earliest ages, the report
conchides.

Mhat, it states, is the only effective
way the nation’s young people can
develop an appreciation of the bal-
ance between independence and abli-
gation and learn to value the con-
cepts of fair play and justice.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

And Now... Part 3 Of
Captain Lexington And His
Astonishing Money-Making Machine

It certainly isn't exactly refreshing to see one of Lexing-
ton’s own residents dreaming up ways to tax Washington and
Lee University. It might not be so bad if Mr. Charles W. Gunn,
Jr. was a representative in the Virginia House of Delegates
from another city, but the fact that he is a lawyer here in town
and a representative to the House strikes us as ironic,

This time the “Town vs. Gown” serial has taken a remark-
able twist in plot. Before the Virginia House of Delegates is a
bill presented by Mr. Gunn which would give Virginia counties
and municipalities the right to tax dwellings which are owned
by non-profit organizations, Aha! Washington and Lee Uni-
versity in Lexington, Virginia is a non-profit organization
which owns certain dwellings. Conclusion? If the law passes
and Governor Holton signs it, Lexington, Virginia can tax
Washington and Lee University if it so chooses, Here, the
plot falls apart and the exciting climax is known by all. Lex-
ington will choose to tax W&L and installment number 3 is
over.

We have no way of knowing whether Mr, Gunn is aware
that Washington and Lee has enough monetary problems
without having to worry about paying a tax on its faculty
housing to the city of Lexington. We also don't know whether
Mr. Gunn is cognizant of the facts surrounding the controversy
over the tag tax on students’ cars which went into effect this
fall. But we do know that if Washington and Lee University
was built on casters, we'd be the first to push it somewhere else
in the Valley.

Much of the economic life of this city is sustained by the
simple fact that W&L is here. Washington and Lee provides
jobs for the people of this area as well as money for local mer-
chants. At worst, the city would be much less than it is with-
out W&L and VMI to support it. But this is almost a fait
accompli. Instead of an attempt at making the monetary exis-
tence of the students and the University convenient, it seems
that the city has done its best to make it as unpalatable as pos-
sible as the year has progressed. We're aware that the city
needs money, but are they aware that W&L needs every cent
it can get? Judging from the actions which have been taken
and which are impending in the House, we don’t think so,

We ask that if this bill is passed by the Virginia legislature,
Governor Holton, you will consider the plight of this Univer-
sity as well as others around this state. Private institutions of
higher learning in Virginia and about the country are not ex-
actly in clover as they enter the 1970's. Washington and Lee
does not need another expense to add to the debit side of their
hooks—especially when money is tight and its plans for devel
opment have just begun.

In the meantime, we ask the students of Washington and
Lee to write Mr. Charles W. Gunn, Jr. and attempt to explain
to him that we don't need any more taxes. And the next time
you buy anything here in town, listen to how the merchant
says, “Thank you,”

A Suggestion For The Student Union

Did you know that W&L’s Student Union does not have
an educational television hookup? The conception of the Stu-
dent Union was that it provide areas for recreation, congrega
tion, study, education, and entertainment. The building has
certainly served its purpose on all counts, except the educa
tional one

Educational television provides what we consider the only
valuable television viewing because it brings informative and
the
enough, Washington and Lee doesn't have an antenna which

cultural events into view of everyone. Yet, strangely
would give clear reception for all educational television pro
yrains

We hope that in the budget for the Student Union next
vear there will be an allocation for the purchase of this special
antenna, Without educational television in the Student Union
the value of the building itself seems to be more oriented to

wards recreation than education

Law School: Out In The Cold

By SKIP PAUKERT

“There just doesn't seem to be
any effort to communicate .. .”"—so
said one senior law student in identi-
fying what he believes to be a seri-
ous problem at W&L, namely the
matter of a working rapport, or
lack thereof, between the under-
graduate and the law — schools.
Enough of his fellow students share
his viewpoint to warrant an exami-
nation of the  relationship—eco-
nomic, academic, political, and soc-
ial—between the Law School and
the university as a whole, and what
it will mean for the future students
of both groups.

The School of Law has been an
official segment of W&L since 1870,
and became a member of the As-
sociation of American Law Schools
in 1920. It has always ‘been highly
respected and has been able to boast
of five alumni who have served as
President of the American Bar As-
sociation, a record exceeded by only
two other law schools.

“Our goal is excellence as an aca-
demic institution,” remarked Roy L.
Steinheimer, Dean of the School of
Law. “And there is no doubt that
Law school students should be able
to interchange their ideas with other
students in the university.”

Steinheimer pointed out that with-
in the Law School itself, there re-
mains a certain degree of autonomy
and self-government. Members of
the Law faculty sit on their own
committees within the school—Our-
riculum, Admissions, Academic
standards, Library, ets.—which cor-
respond to similar committees in the
undergraduate sector. The Law
School is also often represented on
other general faculty committees,
such as the faculty EC and the Ad-
missions Committee.

Steinheimer added that there
seemed to be no partition between
members of the law and undergradu-
ate faculties. “During the day we
have coffee together at the Alumni
house or at the Co-op; on a more
academic level, there is quite a

flux of aw professors invited to
undergraduate classes to talk, and
vice versa. We even have had under-
graduate instructors and professors

sitting in on our Roman Law
course,”
As to an exchange of actual

courses between the law school and
other departments, the difficulty

stems largely from the staff limiita-
tions and the large number of law

 

sociology, and economics.”

Some students have complained
that there should be greater contact
between the law and undergraduate
students in the area of student activi-
ties—government, speaker programs,
seminars, and the like. The question
then follows: who is responsible for
the present indifference, the under-
graduates or the law students?

“Part of the problem is the gen-

students presently enrolled. John
Markham, a junior law student and
past representative to the EC, hopes
for improvements in this area in the
future: “Academically, there seems
to be a lot that is not done that
should be done in terms of an inter-
change. Law is an embodiement of
the social sciences, and, therefore,
there could be academic bridges
with, say, courses in psychology,

eration gap, offered Gene Wollard,
a senior law student who has served
on the Honor Court and as secre-
tary-treasurer of the Legal Aid and
Research Association. “I would like
to see the undergraduates take more
initiative to include the law school
in the campus life.”

“Last spring several students came
to us for legal advice on how to go
about their activities during the mor-

the undergraduates see us at the

some of us are more concerned about

Markham, however, saw a large

the law students. “If we could get

versity would probably, to a large
degree, follow suit.”

Troubs’ Fare:
Professional a

By STEVE HAUGHNEY

There’s a troupe of wandering
actors come to town this week to
put on a play, and if you want to
experience theatre of professional
quality, 1 urge you to see their per-
formance. Washington and Lee's
own Troubadours have brought their

production of “Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead” back to
Lexington after a week on tour

around Virginia, a week during
which they have honed a good pro-
duction into an excellent one.

The play presents the spectacle of
two minor characters from Shake-
speare’s “Hamlet” trying to compre-
hend their roles in the Elsinore
drama, attempting to play their parts
to the best of their limited ability.
Walkie May and Lawrence McCon-
nell give superb interpretations of a
foppish Rosencrantz and an absurd
Guildenstern and turn a very funny
script into a hilarious stage per-
formance.

Walkie May, who was a standout
in a minor part in the Troubs’ first
production of the year, “Billy Budd, ’
accepts the much more demanding
role of Rosencrantz with great ease
and skill, giving a flawless perform-
ance. Lawrence McConnell, who has
been a leading Trouwb actor since
his freshman year, makes his Guil-
denstern the best performance of
his Washington and Lee career.

The supporting cast is also out-
standing. Richard Pilkinton, as the
Player who leads the motley band
of tragedians who perform at Elsi-
nore, is at once disarming and
menacing, while Beach Vickers gives
us a humorous, hapless Alfred. All
of those in the smaller roles do
excellent jobs, particularly Cal
Whitehurst as Gertrude and Stephen
Lester as the tottering Polonius.

Phe technical crews hive up to
their past standard of excellence
lhe brilliant lighting gives the stage
a quality of barrenness which sets
off sharply the outrageously color-
ful costumes of Rosencraniz and
Guildenstern, accentuating the im-
pression of their alienation and isola-
tion. O. K. Barnes’ set is inten-
tionally anonymous: it could be any-
where, for the pathetic antics of
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern can-
not be confined to Elsinore or to a
ship on its way to England, but are
alarmingly similar to our own,

Special recognition is due to Di-
rector Ellen Barnes, who takes Tom
Stoppard’s script as published and
makes it her own. She has done a
very effective job with the scissors.
cutting out lines and even whole
scenes that don't suit her image of
the play. The result is a script that
is terse and fast-paced, with none of
the diffuseness or volubility that
tends to mar Stoppard’s original
version. The foous of the play is
still the same—the absurd situation
of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
but Mrs. Barnes’ cuts have made it
more direct and, as a consequence
I think. more penetrating for the
audience

She has done more to the script
than cut #, however, in what |
hink is a successful attempt to un
derscore the absurdity of the two
leading characters. The script calls
for Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
10 fl~p coins and to bet on the ou

By MACK WOODWARD

A boy I know is on drugs. He’s
not a close friend, maybe not even
a friend. If I'd known him better,
maybe I could have done something,
but I doubt it. How he got on drugs
1 don’t know, other than he started
out on marijuana, and has graduated
to the big time: LSD, mescaline,
et al. The more I think about it, the
less sense drugs make.

Of course a discussion of drugs is
rather futile today; warnings seem to
fall on deaf ears, and many who are
opposed to drugs read anti-drug
opinions and tell each other, “I told
you so.” (Maybe I’m one of them).
Fighting futility as well as drugs,
I sally forth to beat the perhaps
unbeatable foe.

I have heard two basic “reasons”
conjured up to explain drug use,
escapism and hedonism. One might
here deliver a five column inch
harangue against hedonism or escap-
ism, but one would be ignoring
another more immediate “reason”
that drugs have become so popular.
Drugs are glamorous.

The glamor of drugs is the
really amazing aspect of the whole
problem. Ten years ago, drugs were
regarded as a problem of the ghettos.
The dope peddier in those junior
high school films was really nasty

But now the most stylish parties
feature a few puffs of pot. (Isn't
social democratization wonderful?)

One wonders about this almost
overnight blooming of the drugs cul-
ture. One wonders about the atmos-
phere that is conducive to the bloom-
ing of such a culture. The best
answer I can find is that the existing
oulture is, indeed, hedonistic and
escapist. And we have made full
circle.

But I refuse—naively and opti-
mistically perhaps—to believe that
people are so weak that they must
seek such an addictive escape as
drugs are. Drugs are a pessimistic
answer to any question; they are the
beginning of an almost never-end-
ing cycle. The human mind is cap-
able of resolving more problems and
making more decisions than most
realize; it really doesn’t need to be
expanded any further than it is to
function properly.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

By JEFFREY SPENCE

In just a matter of days the Con-
stitutional Convention for W&L will
convene. This meeting of students
has ‘been proposed iby the Executive
Committee for the purpose of revis-
ing student government on our
campus.

Unfortunately, not only has it been
proposed by the E.C. but it will be
regulated and conducted under their
auspices. Futhermore the E.C. will
'be seated as a block of twelve regu-
lar voting delegates.

If one were to read the plans for
this convention, they might easily
come to the conclusion that this
meeting will be nothing more than
a rubber stamp for whatever the
E.C, desires in a new constitution.
The pat argument that denies this is
the E.C, will be only 12 of 47
delegates and thus not even a
quorum for discussion.

This argument shows up hollow
when you realize that after the con-
vention ends the E.C. has to vote

Leach Reviews Library Situation

Unprecedented growth and inno-
vation highlighted the operations of
Washington and Lee’s library system
in the 1969-70 academic year, ac-
cording to the report released by
head librarian Maurice Leach last
week.

Spending for books, periodicals,
and supplies was more than double
the level of the previous year, $136,-
886 in the latest year, up from
$62,346 the year before.

At year's end, the main library

and the six undergraduate depart-
mental libraries ‘held 225,263 vol-
umes, an increase of more than
12,000 volumes.

Counting governmental doouments
on deposit in the library system, and
other miscellaneous materials, the
undergraduate library system now
includes more than 300,000 holdings.

The university's law library, ad-
ministered separately, contains an
additional 50,000 holdings. The
undergraduate system includes Cyrus
Hall McCormick Library and speci-
alized libraries in the departments of
journalism, biology, chemistry,
geology, physics, and in the Schoo!
of Commerce, Economics and Poli-
tics.

The total library budget was $251,-
688, almost double the previous
year’s total of $136,200. The former
figure represented 5.2 per cent of
the University’s overall ‘budget,
marking the first time that the Li-
brary has surpassed the American
Library Association's minimum, (5
per cent) in many years,

In terms of accessibility to books,
which, along with the collection of
materials is a fundamental goal of
the library whe report is less opti-
mistic. A drop of 16 per cen in
the circulation of materials was
noted, and due at least in part to
needs in other areas, profession re-
ference services were down from 65
to 44 hours per week. Acquisition
of new titles, however, was up a
striking 89 percent over the previ-
ous year,

Inter-library activity with neigh-
boring Virginia Military Institute
was continued, and the possibility of
other cooperative ventures, possibly
with the other members of the 7
College Exchange Program, were al-
so pursued.

Projected plans for the new bibrary
were also discussed in committee
meetings and through a series of
faculty visits throughout the country

during the summer of 1970.

The long-standing efficiency of
Washington and Lee’s Honor System
was noted in an inventory, covering
a 21 year span, that showed only
| percent of the present holding to
be missing. There was, however, last
spring, a “considerable increase” in
the losses of reference materials and
periodicals.

In evaluating the report, Leach
stressed the support of the Uni-
versity community, and the “loyalty
and ingenuity of the library staff.”
As a major goal for the future, he
cited the expansion of reference ca-
pabilities and the growth of profes-
sional reference aid, notably during
weekends.

The librarian also stressed the role

of students in governing their library,
not only through the activities of
the Student Library Committee, but
also through suggestions and com-
plaints by individual students. “Any
member of the library staff will be
pleased to assist students.” Leach
added. “My door is always open.”

Leach also recommended, in addi-
tion to “direct” criticism, the use of
the suggestion boxes situated
throughout the ‘building for those
who wish to make anonymous com-
plaints.

Copies of the library report will
be made available to students at
the main desk. Any member of the
student body who encounters diffi-
culty in obtaining one should see a
menrber of the staff.

Old-Time Jazz At VMI

The Rockbridge Concert-Theatre
Series will present as its third con-
cert this season the Preservation Hall
Jazz Band on Thursday, Feb. 18,
in Jackson Hall at VMI. The concert
will begin at 8:15 p.m.

Preservation Hall, in the French
Quarter of New Orleans, is the home
cf the old jazz musicians whose vital
folk art is now seldom heard.

Originating as funeral-march brass
bands and as background for the
shows of the Storyville era of the
the wurn of the century, this jazz
differs from Dixieland in that it is
more improvisational and more spon-
taneous. The musicians are in the
tradition of Bessie Smith, Jelly Roll
Morton, and Leadbelly.

on anything that is proposed. If they
find something they don’t like they
can in effect kill it for all time.

This is how it works. The conven-
tion \proposals are voted on by the
Executive Committee. If any or all
the proposals pass then they are
submitted to the student body for
nacification. To pass the student body
it would take only a majority vote.
However, if the E.C. rejects any
proposals of the convention then it
would take a voting turn out of
two-thirds of the student body and
a two-thirds vote of them to over-
ride the E.C.'s veto.

The idea of this convention is a
good one. What is unfortunate about
it is that all the cards are stacked
in favor of the Executive Commit-
tee and its desires. Let us hope that
those people who are to be seated
as delegates from the university will
not allow themselves to be intimi-
dated by the awesome power-elite
that is the Executive Committee.

Students of W&L are allowed to
go to the convention although they
may not directly speak to the floor.
Lobbying is an old American tradi-
tion; use it. You may not ‘be allow-
ed to speak directly to the conven-
tion ‘but that does not prevent you
from speaking to the delegates on
a one to one basis.

Of course, the final power of
change rests with the vote of each
individual student. If you care about
your school and you think that your
‘beliefs have gone unsatisfied, then
get out and vote. A guarantee of a
two-thirds turn out is a power to
be reckoned with by the Executive
Committee,

Cavaliers Dominate,
Generals Fall 92-70

But W@L Wins Two;
Sinks Hampden-Sydney;
Totals Emory @ Henry

By PALMER TRICE

“They never quit.” This was the
comment made by Coach Corrigan,
after his team’s trouncing of our
Generals. A surprisingly large parti-
san crowd watched the Cavaliers
capture a 92-70 victory over the
visitors. Coach Canfield was disap-
pointed in a way, but he felt that
his squad learned from the en-
counter,

Except for a short-lived 4-3 lead,
the Blue trailed for the remainder
of the ball game. U.Va. started
quickly, with Barry Parkhill garner-
ing their first seven points. The height
advantage that the Cavalier enjoyed,
plus a quick trapping defense proved
more than enough to undo the
visitors,

Washington and Lee turned the
ball over 24 times, as compared to
18 by U.Va. However, the Generals
press was effective in spurts. After
the game, Coach Canfield noted that
“we can gress anybody.”

Offensively, the Blue were led by
Mike Daniel's 20 points, several of
which were gotten on layups behind
the Virginia defense. Ellie Gutshall
had 6 assists. Coming off the bench,
Skip Lichtfuss grabbed 8 rebounds,
and had nine points. John Dumas
had six big rebounds, and proved
more than adequate in his reserve
role. However, the Generals shot 10
percent poorer than the Cavaliers
from the field, making seven less
shots.

The following night, Wednesday,
the Generals returned to Doremus to
face the visiting Tigers of Hampden-
Sydney. In their first meeting, the
Tigers had nipped the Generals at
Death Valley. The Blue were a tired
bunch, both mentally and physically,
after playing their hardest the night
before at University Hall.

In a nip and tuck ball game, the
Generals managed to slip by the
Tigers by a score of 78-74. The
tigers overcame a One point half-

time deficit early in the 3rd period,
and held the lead until the two
minute mark. After grabbing the
lead on a basket by John Dumas,
the Generals went into a type of
four corners offense. The visitors
were forced to foul, and ithe shots
were converted by Doug Clelan.
Bruce King made the first of his
attempts, missed the second, but ‘the
Generals grabbed the rebound. With
no time left, Doug Clelan converted
two more, to put the icing on the
cake.

It is interesting to note that the
basketball head man, Verne Can-
field, is the winningest coach in all of
WA&L’s 62 years of roundball history.
‘Up to this moment, his record stands
at 98-61 and two wins out of the
remaining six scheduled games would
get Canfield into his own elite “100
Club.”

Speaking of clubs, the “Over 1,000

should join such international stars
as Don Flora (2,310), Jay Handlan
(2,002), Mel Cartwright (1,800), Lee
Marshall (1,561), Mike Neer (1,289)
and Jim Rich (1,005).

If one is interested in broken
records, this year’s basketball squad

most fouls in a game—24 set in
1959—by ripping off 25 against
Hampden-Sydney in their first en-
counter.

Boasting a 12-5 record thus far,

THE RING-TUM PHI

0 THE EO

OR

On R.O.T.C. Crisis

To the editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

I believe the debate on the ROTC
issue has been sufficient for the aver-
age reader to come to some kind
of decision on where he stands.
However, your editorial compels me
to try to clarify my position.

First of all, I have enough prob-
lems without your paper announc-
ing to my \professors what courses |
do and do not like. If, after all,
you think I support the abolition of
ROTC credit merely because I do
not like the courses, which I did
not say, then I ‘begin to despair over
men’s complete imability to com-
municate with one another, Unless
I state then, 1 do not think it is fair
for yo uto create my motivation.

Secondly, we are not discussing
whether there are other courses on
campus unworthy of credit. The fact
that such courses exist in no way
enhances the value of ROTC. There
are certain activities which this
school just doesn’t give oredit for.
Among these are rugby, typing, au‘o
mechanics and driver's educa‘ion.
From my point of view, ROTC
comes closer to these than its does
to a course like the Social and In-
tellectual History of the United
States. Perhaps I have misunderstood
your editorials, but I think you have
stil not attempted to show why
ROTC should not be included in the
former group of activities rather
than the latter.

As I noted in my first letter, there
are courses such as Military History,
which do have academic value. But
the bulk of them do not. Half of the
material we covered in Map Reading
| had already learned as a 12-year-
old in Boy Scouts. I don't think this
University (or any high school, for
that matter) should offer even part-
ial credit for such a course. And, as

for drill, which ts about 20 per cent
of our grade, what is the academic
value of a properly executed right
face?

Thirdly, I did not say ROTC made
one’s course load lighter, or that it
helped raise GPR’s (although with
my A I'm still only 18 in a class of
38). These were reasoms given to
me by other cadets for wanting to
retain credit. I have yet to hear any-
one currently taking ROTC support
granting the credits to the course for
any academic reason. Apparently,
such a reason is far from the minds
of those taking the course.

I am not, as you imply, favoring
the removal of ROTC from the
campus, merely the credit. If the boss
of two hours of credit is enough to
cause a mass exodus from the pro-
gram, I frankly don’t see why the
Army would be interested in officers
with such poor motivation.

I am also aware that the Army
gives scholarships, since I ‘have a
four-year scholarship myself (the last
I heard). The Army recognizes that
a college career is a good back-
ground for the officer; ROTC is their
“filler” material in which they im-
part certain vocational knowledge as
squad formation, etc. But, with the
exceptions I already mentioned, the
hill is where you think, the ravine
is Where you do other things. ROTC
is essential training, but it is not
academic,

I imagine we still disagree, but |
heige that by now you understand
that my motivation (if you must
question it) is my concern for aca-
demic standards, and not my mytho-
logical dislike for a course.

Reply To Gingold

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

This letter would be more ap-
propriately addressed to Mr. Jeff
Gingold, since its contents are in
direct reply to his calm, considered,
logically perfect, and persuasive let-
ter,

First of all, Mr. Gingold, I'd like
to clear up a few things in your
mind about news reporting, editorial
opinion, commentaries, and the re-
lationship between a newspaper edi-

tor and his palper, When a man
writes an editorial, he puts down
his Opinion as based on a logical
consideration of objective facts.
These facts are as available to him
as they are to the holders of the
Opposing opinions, If the opposition
has select access to certain valuable
facts, it is their duty (if they are
really interested in rational argu-
ment) to reveal those new eanrth-
shaking facts in those argument.
Hence, the editor of this paper has
not ‘been writing on the ROTC
question out of ignorance or close-
mindedness; rather, he has been writ-
ing about the facts the way he sees
them. What you really mean, Mr.
Gingold, when you say that he
“didn’t get the facts from both
sides,” is that he didn’t get his
Opinion from both sides. Instead
he did some god-awful independent
thinking. Now then, Mr. Gingold,
you were correct when you said
that the Ring-tum Phi is Lawrence
McConnell’s paper, since he is the
editor, However, you make a basic
error. For some reason, you fail to
realize that the opinion of the
paper is the opinion of the editor,
and vice versa. When the editor
writes an editorial, it is correct
journalistic form to say, “the opinion
of The Ring-tum Phi,” instead f
saying, “my opinion.” Mr. Gingold,
you compared the job Mr. McCon-
nell has done with the work of the
radio station. Alas, it seems your
contact with media functioning has
been quite limited. There is a dis-
tinction between an editorial in a
newspaper and a radio commentary,
At a very basic level, the former is
a brief argument in favor of a par-
ticular point of view while the latter
is a much longer and thorough
coverage of all the facts, all the
Opinions, and perhaps forms an
opinion in conclusion.

I must say that I think that Mr.
McConnell has been doing a good
job of running The Ring-tum Phi.
Every issue has contained numerous
articles expressing an opinion con-
trary to his own. However, since
you have displayed such an obvious
willingness to “listen to” another
man’s opinion on innumerable oc-
casions, (such as the Cockpit after
Dr. Toole’s Contact presentation) |

What you should know about diamonds
when you know it's for keeps

 

You've dreamed about your
diamond engagement ring a thou-
sand times. But now that you
know it's for keeps, it’s time to
stop dreaming and start learning
about diamonds and their value.

Because no two diamonds
are exactly alike, jewelers have
adopted exacting standards to de-
termine the relative value of each
and every diamond in the world.
These standards include a dia-
mond's size (carat weight), color,
cut and clari

 

COLOR: Fine white diamonds are
quite rare and valued accordingly.
Other shades in relative order of
their worth are: blue, yellow,
brown and black.

CUT: The cut of a diamond—the
facets placed on it by a trained
cutter—brings out the gem's fire
and brilliance. Anything less than
correct cut reduces beauty, bril-
liance and value

CLARITY: Determined by the ab-
sence of small impurities, A per-
fect diamond has no impurities
when examined under ten power
magnification by a trained eve

CARAT A diamond's siz is
measured in carats, As a diamond
increases in size, its price will
increase even more if the quality
remains constant, But larger dia-
monds of inferior quality may ac-
tually be worth less than emalier,
perfect diamonds

Law School: In The Cold

(Continued from Page 2)

Phil Thompson added: “Law stu-
dents are now, more and more, from
other undergraduate colleges; they
have no real appreciation for the
WAL ‘life style.’ There is really very
litthe common ground.”

There are plans for the School
of Law to eventually move out of
Tucker Hail to a new building across
the ravine. “This geographical di-
vorce,” said Thompson, “will most
likely make this isolation even more
pronounced.”

mittee is relatively unknown to many
students, I would hope that the
students would become better ac-
quainted with this committee since
its primary purpose is to serve stu-
dents. If a student does have a
request he should submit his peti-
tion to the office of the Dean of
the College. In this petition he
should include all pertinent informa-
tion concerning his case and his rea-
sons for seeking his request. Each
individuals request is dealt with on
an individual and fair basis. | would
encourage students to utilize th’s
commnittee as a possible solution to
problems they might have. If there

able to answer I can be reached in

Troubs Go To Big City

to rehearse and adapt their staging
of the play to the physical arrange-
ment of the Masterworks Theatre.

The Washington and Lee growp's
attitude and approach to drama and
to the production itself, as well as
the Troubs’ remarkable honesty, ac-
cording to Mr. Moss, led to the invi-
tation to perform in New York.

 

must give you the benefit of the
doubt, and consider it only your
ignorance in such matters as jour-
nalism that prompted your recent
letter. Lastly, I must express my awe
at your mental prowess, Mr. Gin-
gold. I know of few people with the
extra-sensory perception to know
that Mr. McConnell got his opinion
second or third hand.

Stephen C, Woodruff

So how serious this whole prob-
lem is seems to be a rather sub-
jective determination. “Having
graduated from the University of
Pennsylvania, which was a much

larger school,” commented Rob Hart-

mann, President of Student Bar As-
sociation, “I think we have a con-
siderably closer relationship here.”

Both Thompson and Markham
suggested that, should the law school
become a little more organized with-
in, interested law students would
be able to find the avenues to project
their efforts in university affairs.
Woolard maintained that under-
graduates should perhaps remember
to include the law students in their
campus activities and (programs by
increased publicity and considera-
tion of law schedules.

Dean Steinheimer, however, off-
ered an observation central to the
issue-at-hand: “The Law School will
remain an integral part of the uni-
versity, and it will be up to the
students to mold their own pattern
of university life and unity,”

EC Studies Poll

(Continued from Page 1)
ful with alumni relations in
area,

Lawrence referred the matter to
the financial committee, which was
charged with an examination of
how much money was currently
available in the budget. Lyles
promised to inquire with other pos-
sible sources also for aid on the
project.

The Honor System committee was
able to distill five main student gen-
ernal sentiments from the data re-
turned on the surveys: (1) that the
jurisdiction of the honor system be
effective only while school was in
session, (2) that teachers should be
more specific as to what homework
and/or testing should be pledged or
unpledged, (3) that an additional
stipulation allowing for a one-year
suspension be added to the absolute
penalty as an alternative sentence
for the EC in an honor case.

(4) That the EC should be allowed
some discretion on determining the
degree of the penalty with consid-
eration to the integrity of the stu-
dem, and (5) that a student found
guilty of a violation not be required
to be accompanied by two EC mem-
bers until his leaving the school.
