IFC President

It is generally agreed that the ex-
tended rush <*>, which was initi-
ated by the iFC th’s year, took the
“rush” cut of rushing. This was one
of the objeciives hoped for by the
University when it required the fra
ternties to come up with an alterna-
tive to the “Rush Week.”

While this may have been the
case last fall, one thing is certain—
the “rush” that was eliminated was
replaced. unfortunately, by tedium
and apathy for fraternity men and
rushes alike, especially in the period’s
last few weeks.

This problem is only one of the
many presently being studied by the
Interfraternity Council's rush com-
mittee. Headed by Kenny Murov,
this group was formed in November
to evaluate the new rush program
and to offer suggestions for iis im-
provement. To alleviate the prob-
lem mentioned above, the commit-
tee has recommended that the period
be shortened to four weeks, The
statistics from rush last fall justify
such a change, showing that an
overwhelming majority of the fresh-
men that eventually joined fraterni-
ties did so by the fourth week of
the rush period.

Another aspect of the program
that the committee has concentrated
on is the number of regulations
Which limit contact between fra-
ternity men and rushees. However,
the “no-contact” regulations offset
this advantage.

That the “no-contact” rules de-
creased the effectiveness of rush is
further supported by a survey under-
taken by the National Fraternity
Council. This study showed that
schools that did not conduct rush
under the “no-contact” regulations
were usually more successful than
the schools which did impose re-
strictions, Therefore, the rush com-
ntiee has recommended that the
IFC discard the “no-contwet” regula-
bron.

Of course, any new system will
have its flaws and it would obviously
be untrue to suggest that this year's
rush program was an exception.
However, after intensive study, the
rush committce has outlined some
fundamenal changes which should
make mex: year’s rush a snoo.ter
and more effeciive operation.

Troubs Open Production

Of New Play On The Road

Like wandering artists befitting of
their name, the Troubadours began
their week tour of “Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead” by troop-
ing en masse to Randolph-Macon
Women’s College last night to open
their production.

Their second production of the
season will open at WA&L in the
Froubadour Theater at 8:30 p.m.
next Tuesday and will run through
Saturday.

As the acting company performs
at Mary Baldwin, Roanoke College,
Radford, and the University of Rich-
mond, they will be confronted with
a New stage each evening.

Yet the very act of coping with
problems on the stage is an integral
part of “Rosencrantz and Guilden-
stern Are Dead” dself. Two minor
characters in Shakespeare's “Ham-
let.” Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
have no inkling of what the world
cf Els nore Castle is all about. They
know they were summoned by the
king, Claudius, to discover the cause
of Hamlet's madness. Tha: is all
they know.

Fo; Hamle. Clautus, and the
rest of the Els nore couri, these two
are insignficant pawns in a larg?
drama. Bui for Rosencrantz and
Guildens:ern, the'r plight is extrem-
ely sign ficanmt: they cannot find the
cause of Hamlet's madness no mu‘iter
how deviously they queston, and
they fumble for words before the

Allman Brothers

Will Play This Weekend

Friday and Sw.urday nights will
mark the return of the concert week-
end w.ih two big names on tap to
provide some of the best entertain-
ment of the year. Combined with
numerous combo parties at the fra-
tern.ty houses, this could be the
biggest sociai .vent of the year.

Friday nigii.’s concert will feature
Liv.ngs:on Taylor, ithe youngest
brewher of the popular James Taylor.
His performance will be matched
on the folowing night by the ex-
tremely talented Allman Brothers
Band.

Both conceris are expected to be
sell-outs and those wishing to buy
tickets at the door are advised to
come early to be asured of seat-
ing. There will be a liimted amount
of standing room. Tickets for non-
Dance Plan subscribers will be $10
per couple per night. Each concert
will be held in Doremus and doors
will open shortly after 7 p.m. The
concerts are scheduled to begin at
8 p.m.

The similarities between the styles
and sounds of Livingston and his
brother James are siriking, yet Liv-
ingston still manages to maintain
his identity as something more than
just one of the many James Taylor
imitators currently in vogue.

Now at the age of 19 Liv Taylor
is Out in the world and making a
name for himself. He came out with
an album fast spring, appropriately
ttled “Livingston Taylor.” A cut
from that album, “Oarolina Day,”
has just been released as a single.

While Liv has the same countri-
fied voice as his brother, and his
music is characterized by the same

Virginia Beats W&L

It was a rough game last night for
the basketball Generals in Oharlot-
tesville as they lost to the Cavaliers
92-70. The Virginia squad, which
has been ranked as high at 15th in
the nation this year, was just too
talented for WAL.

Washington and Lee was never
really close. The Wahoos utilized
a full court press which halted the
WAL offense. The press caused fatal
errors in the first half such as steals,
bad pases and fast breaks for the
home team,

W&L was beaten badly on the
boards. Virginia had several big
men who overpowered the smaller,
less experienced Generals. U. Va.
Strength on the offensive boards was
undoubtably the death knell for
Washington and Lee.

The Cavaliers mastered the W&L
zone defense by shooting extremely
well from outside and bringing the
ball down the court quickly. Vir-

ginia also limited W&L to long shots
with aggressive defensive play.

The W&L squad could not hit
the needed outside shots to keep
them in the contest. Captain Mike
Daniel was hitting pretty well from
outside, but not well enough to halt
the Cavaliers. Hatton Smith reacted
well against the pressing defense and
Skip Lichtfuss did an admirable job
underneath.

Over 150 tickets for the game were
sold to Washington and Lee students,
Quite a few General fans were pres-
em and with 6:00 left and the Blue
team down by 30 you could hear
a chorus of the W&L Swing, loud

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

February 3, 1971

Should Daddy Warbucks Get Tough?

December was a record month for the Financial Relations
Committee and its chairman, Mr. Henry Harkey. $600 in bad
checks came into the committee’s hands during the Christmas
rush,

Mr, Harkey and his committee are appalled. And so are we
The grand total to date for cold checks covered by the commit-
tee is $1,700-a record by astronomical proportions for the com-
mittee.

In November the number of checks returned due to “in-
sufficient funds” was alarming enough. We had hoped that stu-
dents would be more prudent after the first indications of a
rise in the amount of bad checks was reported in these columns.
It seems though that there are some who still feel that the Fi-
nancial Relations Committee will always be there (in loco
parentis) to bail them out of financial trouble to the harsh tune
of $700.

The committee, along with the EC, has taken a lukewarm
measure so far: affixing signs to cash registers around town to
remind students that they should have enough funds in the
bank to cover their checks before they cash them. Will this
work? Probably not, because students may continue to sign
their names on the line in the bottom right hand corner of
their checks secure in the knowledge that the Financial Re-
lations Committee will come to their monetary rescue like the
cavalry in a grade “B” western movie, How does the sign
change anything? If there are students who attend Washing-
ton and Lee who don’t know it’s not a good idea to write a
check for money they don’t possess, then we'd begin question-
ing the admissions office. But we have more faith in the intel-
ligence of the student body than that.

However, we have less faith than we had in November in
their integrity and their common sense. We suggest that the
Student Financial Relations Committee and the Executive
Committee alter its policies somewhat and quit playing Daddy
Warbucks for the students. After a fixed number of offenses
(we suggest the number three), the student involved should be
faced with the unpleasant prospect of being turned over for
prosecution by the local merchant to whom the bounced check
was written. After all, we know of no government office which
covers the bad checks of U.S. citizens, And if some students are
really screaming for a taste of the world in our supposedly
closed environment, let the Financial Relations Committee
give it to them after three tries at responsibility.

We suspect that with this added incentive the students of
Washington and Lee will become — if not miraculously — at
least somewhat more responsible when they sign their names
on checks in the future.

Staff Editorial
The Atomization Of Democracy

A Constitutional Convention sounds like a laudable demo-
cratic idea, but is it really that or is it an attempt by the Execu-
tive Committee to change the role and responsibilities of the
EC? It appears that the Convention will be a rubber stamp of
the changes wanted by the EC for the EC,

Throughout this academic year the Constitutional Com-
mittee has made surveys and held forums on the problems of
the current Student Body Constitution, These surveys were
administered to a minority of the W&L community and the
forums were almost exclusively attended by the members of
the Constitutional Committee and the Executive Committee.

\lthough these forums were characterized by minimal
crowds, the EC has called a Constitutional Convention. Judg
ing from the general absence of petitions required of prospec
tive convention delegates, does anybody care? Few seemed
to care about the survey, fewer still cared about the forums
This trend seems to overflow to the Convention, Who cares?
Nobody, Right!

The student government according to the proposed changes
will be divided between the Honor Court and Student Senate
\ll student government and student activities come under the
jurisdiction of the Student Senate, and in a similar manner, all
questions concerning the Honor System are encompassed by
the Honor Court,

In theory this division constitutes a separation of power,
In practice it means a concentration of power for seven indivi
duals, A total of seven of the 12 Proposed Honor Court mem
hers are either members of the Student Senate or appointed
The theory of separate structures with separate purposes is
shattered

Delegates to the Convention are required to compile peti
tions of their intent with 25 signatures, Correction, almost all
delegates are required to file petitions; the EC is exempt, The
EC appointed its 12 members as delegates ex officio, Are the
members of the EC warranted in appointing themselves dele
rates

Certainly not. This Convention will surely

study the re
tructure of the EC. If that governmental structure needs

radical changes, the current members seem

The Troubadours hit the road this week on a tour to various colleges in the area to present their most recent

“Rosencrantz And Guildenstern”:
A Serious Brand Of Humor

By STEVE HAUGHNEY

In August, 1966, at the Edinburgh
Festival, a young drama critic named
Tom Stoppard saw his first play
performed on stage. It was “Rosen-
crantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.”
Within a year it was a smash suc-
cess in London and New York, and
Mr. Scoppard’s name was being

Signs such as this one were recently affixed to cash registers about

linked with those of such well-estab-
lished playwrights as John Osborne
and Harold Pinter as a leading Eng-
kish writer for the stage.

The basic situation of “Rosen-
crantz and Guildenstern Are Dead”
is quite simple: it is the “Hamlet”
scenario as seen from the perspective

of the two foolish boyhood friends

town as a reminder to students—“Can you cover it?”

Flurry Of Cold Checks
Plagues Committee

By SKIP PAUKERT

WAL students seom to have a
particular penchant for spending
money and cashing checks. Untor
tunately, the nature of this spending
often borders on the precarious, re-
sulting in compound exasperation
for a group of saidents who make up
the Student Finano.al Relat.ons
Committee, or, as most of us know
it, the Cold Check Committee

In an average semester im the past,
the amount of debt resuli.ng from
bad checks cashed by students in
local stores totals about $1000, This
year, however, the sum through De
cember reached nearly $1800, and
this substanial increase in student
negligence has caused considerable
re-evaluation of committee proce.
dures.

“There is no doubt that this jump
in “bounced checks is cause for
alarm,” remarked Henry Harkey,
chairman of the committee. “We've
got to make students aware of the
problem so that they realize how
much they are placing the privileges
of the entire sudem body im serous
peopardy.”

The Financial Relations Commit
tee is the only direct liason between
the students and the community, en
compassing three major purposes
(1) to handle unpaxdd accounts a
crued by students with local met
chants (2) to collect bad checks on
a regular basis from Lexington bus
neses, and (3) to disciphne students
with finne power for delmaquency
in financial matters

Harkey pointed out, “lf by April
Ht is evidert that there is will a
multitude of bad cheoks each week
we will be forced to ret with the
EC to arrive a another policy, some
thing a little more drastic.”

Under the current procedures, th
secretary of the conwnitice vieits Lex

neton store often as once a week

to pick up cold checks and to keep
track of unpaid accounts. The com-
mittee then reimburses the mer-
cham for the amount of the bounced
checks and then notifies the students
responsible that they mus! appear
before the committee at their Thurs-
day nght meeting

Students are asked to explain the
error and are then fined, up to $5
for the first offense, $10 for the
second, and $25 for the third. Fol
lowing the third offense, the stu-
demt faces the possible consequences
of EC action

“We havent had many second
offenders this year, and no third
time offenders as of yet,” Harkey
noted. “But these guys are not the
bulk of the problem—dit is our first
offenders that are giving us trouble

Harkey said 4 was likely thal a
freshman would receive a slightly
higher fine than a senior, the latter
heaving gone through four years be
fore a commitice appearance for a
bad cveok. In the cause of bad ac
counts, he sail, the commiullec
poley is to notify the student of

of Hamlet who are called upon by
Claudius first to determine the cause
of Hamlet's madness and later to
escort him to England. Stoppard
pulls out whole speeches from Ham-
let and inserts them in his own play,
never allowing the audience to for-
get that the tragic action of Shake-
speare’s play is going on, mostly
off-stage, while Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern perform their comic
antics.

Th’s inversion of main plot and
subplot of “Hamlet” is a startling
idea, but it is not of itself enough to
build a good play on. What makes
“Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are
Dead” fascinating is Stoppard’s re-
working of many of the moral and
philosophical problems in “Hamlet”
into the hilarious dialogue between
the two unlikely heroes. Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern are buffoons, like
Viadim:r and Estragon in “Waiting
for Godot,” who debate lofty meta-
physical dilemmas and absurd
mundane matiers wit han amazing
lack of clarity and reason.

Yet Stoppard has a definite
method in his characters’ madness.
What struck me most in reading the
play and in seeing rehearsals was
how effectively Stoppard destroys the
ilhesion of the theatre— that a play,
something artificial and unreal, is
going on beyond the “real” world
of the spectators—in order to in-
volve his audience in the action.
Rosencranz and Guildenstern are
themselves spectators, watching the
performance of the traveling com-
peny, the intrigues of the Elsinore
court, and their own destruction. But
While they watch, they are caught
up in the action and must pay the
price with their lives.

The dilemma of Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern, then, is to be part of
an inexorable flow of events over
Which they have no control: they can
neither influence the tossing of a
coin nor their own fates. They carry
on their search for the wrong
answers to the rght questions, secure
in the belief that “Words, words,
they're all we have to go on.” They
are ignorant of Hamlet's dictum that
we mart sur cur acons to our
words—and, Stoppard implies, so are
we all ignorant. In spite of their
terribly funny davlogue, Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern remain isolated
from the other characters in the
play and even from themselves; they
do not talk by themselves, for they
are not alone, but it seems that they
do talk to themselves. It is here that
Stoppard foouses his very serious
humour

I am pleased that Mr. Spence has
decided to transfer his disagreements
with me from my posiers to the
pages of th's paper, wiere a more
rational examination is possible. It
was a ceriain Mr. Henberg who in-
formed me lasi May that defacing

confirmed by a member of the com-
mittee last semester when I inquired
as to whai | should do with one of
my posters that had been defaced
and triumphantly signed by some-
one claiming to be Jeff Spence. The
poster was a warning against Sensi-
tivity Training.

Mr. Spence’s summary of my posi-
tion on Sensitivity Training is quite
accurate and proves that he read my
poster. He should, however, either
look at pages three and four of the
March 2, 1968, edition of the Chi-
cago Daily News, or write to the
National Education Association; for
it is that organization of which the
National Training Laboratories is a
subsidiary, and not the National
Council of Churches (although many
ecople I know would agree that
such would be a good guess). The
gentleman who conducted the sensi-
tivity session in which I participated
was an employee of Esalen and |
can provide his name and proof that
the session occurred to anyone in-
terested. | think its fair to say that
all offic.al trainers of Esalen, like the
one I met, are also official Esalen
trainees. How else would they know
what they're doing?

Anyway, I happen to believe that
anything tha: can be experienced,
and has been recorded, can also be
studied. The same sensory organs
are involved in both situations. Jeff
seems to think that my worries
about Sensitivity Training don't ap-
ply when the sessions are conducted
by “pocfessionals.” | would only rely
on medical doctors and psychiatrists
in serious matters involving physical
and mental health. Since Jeff doesn’t
specify which “professionals” are
safe, | get the feeling that he be-
lieves that as long as someone gets
paid for conducting sensitivity ses-
sions, this immediately qualifies him
to cope with potentialy explosive
conflict between human personalities.
| hope Jeff doesn't apply this prin-
ciple to the treatment of physical
ilines and then contract a serious
disease. S.nce there are some doctors
who don't thnk its “meaningless” to
try to study things like Sensitivity
Training. it might be well to ex-
amine what they say from research
and experience.

Besides the information on my
poster, none of which Mr. Spence
chose to discuss in detail, we have
the statement by Professor of Medi
cal Physology at the University of
California at Berkeley, Dr. Hardin

With Malice Toward Some

The Subject Out OF Hand

By JEFFREY B. SPENCE

The trial of the Lexington One is
now a matiter of history. The case
invo:v:ng a student and a professor,
both of W&L is well known by now.
In fact, it has been the main topic
of discussion here for the last two
weeks, Now that it is over I say,
Good show, ito all involved. Now,
would someone please tell me whut
it was worth?

Jeff Gingold, who I consider a
friend and a brother, never ceases
to amaze me. He has come from
‘being president of his freshman class
iand the epitome of ithe straight fra-
ternity man to ‘being one of the
freakiest and at the same time one
of the most concerned gentlemen on
our Campus,

Under this direction it looks like
the Bakery Free Library will soon
become an active community better-
ment organization. He helped unify
the extreme feelings that were
aroused last May, and also helped
avoid these feelings being expressed
in a violent manner. He is dedicated
to social reform for the bettenment
of all the people and the world they
live in. So why this most recent
move?

When I inquired as to why, I was
told that we can’t let this type of
thing cominue because this is exactly
what the resistence to oppression is
all about. Somehow I just can’t see
that. It seems to me that my friend
could have spent all that time and
energy he put into that trial on any
one of the programs that he sub-

John Wayne

The premier showings cf “No Sub-
stitute For Victory,” an action-filled
color film about Vietnam starring
John Wayne, Martha Raye, and a
host of military leaders, will be
held at the Lyric Cinema in Lex-
ington on Februray 8th and 9th at
12:30 p.m. The 75-minute motion
picture, scheduled for just two show-
ings in the area, surveys this coun-
try’s involvement in Vietnam and
criticizes in no uncertain terms the
“no-win” policies of recent Admini-
strations. The W&L-Lxington T.R.A.
I.N. Committee (To Restore Aimeri-
can Independence Now), which has
urged a “win” policy in Vietnam and
a halt in aid to the Communists, is
sponsoring the public showing.
Tickets are $2.00 each for adults and
$1.00 each for students.

“No Substitute For Victory” was

of Alaska Pictures. Ken has incor-
porated his own on-the-spot action
films of the war, taken during 19
visits to Southeast Asia, in the hard-
hitting documentary narrated by
Academy Award winner John

scribes to for the greater welfare of
the Lexington community.

{it seems to this observer that the
trial was nothing more than an aot
of personal face-saving. There is
nothing wrong with that, but Jet us
not allow jit to ‘become some great
victory for the prolevariet over the
oppressor. Quite simply because it
was not,

The trial of the Lexington One,
who by ithe way lost, did nothing
more than prove that when law is
put to the test in court and in an
orderly manner, that jit will provide
justice. I grant that if plaintiff and
defendent’s roles were switched that
there might have been a harsher out-
come, but I doubt it. Also the ac-
ousing finger can be pointed at the
system and have it said that if the
roles were switched and the de-
fendent was black that the outcome
might have been harsher.

However this was not the case.
Mr. Gingold sued Mr. Colvin and
Mr. Colvin lost. Justice has been
served, Jeff has saved face, Mr.
Colvin has been admonished to give
a damn. Big deal. Now let us get
on with the business at hand.

Let's quit wasting time and see if
‘we can meet the needs of some of
the people in our campus and
community that are in dire need
our aid and resources. I hope thi
trial will mot ‘be portrayed as a
vietory for the Revolution over the
Establishment, but rather, that it will
‘be taken at face value as a civil tort
suit in which one party wins and one
party hoses.

’s Vietnam Film A pears

Wayne. Wayne serves as host and
in his opening remarks sets the tone
for the film: “It’s time we spoke out
about Vietnam and the most obvious,
yet the most ignored threat ever
faced by free people in history of the
world—the Communist Conspiracy.”

Other participants in the film,
from former Vietnam Commander
General Paul Harkins and former
Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft
Benson to combat veterans and form-
er Green Berets, unanimously agree
that two major problems confront-
ing our troops are pol.tical restric-
tions on them and misleading news
reports about the war.

General Albert C. Wedemeyer,
Commander of U.S. Forces in the
Far East during and after World
War II, scores much of the national
reporting about Vietnam. In his ap-
pearance in the film, he declares:
“Too often, our own information
media (T.V., radio, and the press)
are responsible for a widely-held im-
pression that the North Vietnamese
and the Vietcong are the good guys,
and we are the bad guys.” Pormer

“Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,” the Trowbadours

the million-selling record “The Bal-
lad of the Green Berets,” is even
more outspoken: “It was frustrating
to a soldier half-way around the
world, It seemed like the American
public was only getting the informa-
tion the Reds wanted them to. In
fact, I'd say the press has been more
help to the enemy than a fresh di-
vision!”

Although the mass media receives
plenty of criticism in the film for
its coverage of Vietnam, the harsh-
est condemnation is reserved for the
ipoliticians who have committed
men to battle but refuse to let them
win. John Wayne tells it this way:
“Just as with the Berlin pullback in
World War II, and the hamstring-
ing of the mibitary during the Korean
mess, the no-win policy dictated by
‘behind-the-scenes powers in Wash-
ington is again in force. Whenever
we fight the Communists, they seem
to have help from somebody on our
side. Somebody always wants to bend
over backwards to avoid gotting
tough with them.”

‘Half a dozen military leaders, in-
cluding the former Commander of
Pacific Naval Forces, Admiral U. S.
Grant Sharp, and General Mark
Clark, the World War Il Army
Commander who succeeded General
MacArthur in Korea, agree with
Wayne's assessment,

In fact, Admiral Sharp declares
that if it were not for the restrictions
and handicaps imposed by Washing-
ton, the war in Vietnam could have
been over and won more than two
years ago!

Imerspersed throughout the hour-
and-a-quarter movie are action shots
taken in the war zone, and com-
ments by several combat veterans.
In addition to Barry Saddler, Navy
Lieutenant Norde Wilson (who com-
pleted 125 combat air missions) and
former Green Beret Poter Stark (who
lost both legs to a Communist mine)
presem the fighting man’s opinion
of the war,

Stark pays tribute to his fallen
comrades and tells the American
peaple: “You should be very proud
of the men who died fighting the
Communist enemy. They were good
men. They died for the freedom of
others. No more can be asked from
any man.”

Popular entertainer Martha Raye,
who hus made nine trips to Vietnam
to visit the troops there, speaks for
every miltary man when she says:

“invented,”

Back then, vilagers in England
and on the continent had to rely
either on word of mouth or on the
curious Litthe pamphlets called “chap-
books.”

There is, still, however, a_ tiny
group of people who avidly seek out
and collect chapbooks, and some of
the more interesting and noteworthy
examples from one collection—that
of Edward F. Backus of Buena Vista
—whil be on display this month in
McCormick Library.

Mr. Backus, production manager
in the university’s print shop, has
been a chapbook collector for some
20 years. He has dozens of them
now, mostly acquired in Britain,
though even rare-booksellers often
don’t know what they are.

Chapbooks flourished in the 18th
century and in the first third of the
19th, Mr. Backus says, until the
invention of the cylinder press led
to better, quicker and cheaper print-
ing.

Chapbooks were aimed at the
“common folk,” and so above all
they had to be cheap. To meet that
requirement, printers resorted to
using inferior paper, and produced
the Lele books with minimum effort.
The result was that with hardly an
excepsion they were of outrageosuly
shoddy quality.

They sold for a penny or so,
which considering the quality was
not much of a bargain even 200
years ago, and generally were “the
sort of item normally swept out with
the trash,” Mr. Backus says—hence
their scarcity today.

They were sold by itinerant ped-
diers—“chapmen,” they were called,
from the Anglo-Saxon word for
tradesman; hence the term “chap-

Despite their lack of quality, chap-
books had considerable influence on
the thinking of people in remote
towns and hamlets. Apart from the
Bible, according to Mr. Backus,
chapbooks were generally the only
printed mater the rural folk saw
from one year to the next, certainly
the most important.

In the themes, chapbooks were as
diverse as are current books and
movies and TV shows, ranging from
moral philosophy to bawdy ballads
to tales of adventure to political
commentary.

Chapbooks often contained short
“filler” items, alpparently inserted in-
discriminately simply to take up left-
over space. One of the Backus books
on display is titled “The Spaewife;
Or Universal Fortune Teller, Where-
in Your Future Welfare May Be
Known By Physiognomy, Cards,
Palmistry, and Coffee-Grounds. Also
a Distinct Treatise on Moles.”

Usually chapbooks were illustrat-
ed, but—as with the filler articles—
the pictures seldom had any relation
to the main text. Each printer had
a stock of woodcuts, and simply in-
serted whichever blocks were handy,
no matter what they depicted.

The chapbook exhibition in Mc-
Cormick Library, which includes 37
examples from the Backus collect-
ion, will open Feb. 5 and continue
through Feb. 28.

of the College of Arts and Sciences,
William Joseph Watt, denying a

As the Dean of the College, Watt

THE

LaRue’s Press Box

 

Last week, many young men
across the nation waited with bated
breath in anticipation of that nemesis
of youth, the darft. It used to be,
as some remember with fondness,
that a body might have several al-
ternatives. But no longer, with the
new drafit system, one knew exactly
the impending future. Where would
next year find these poor, anxiety-
ridden souls? Germany? Israel? Or
perhaps somewhere in the rice pad-
dies and jungles of Southeast Asia?
Maybe, but more likely it will be
San Francisco, Green Bay, Denver,
or even New York.

The draft held last Thursday de-
termined, at least for the time being,
where several hundred college foot-
ball players would be spending their

time come next August. For the
American and National Football
Conferences had held their annual

post-season rite, the college draft.

And this year’s version was
sprinkled with surpise. Everyone
knew that Jim Plunkett would be
lowly Boston's first choice, and that
Archie Manning was the object of
New Orleans supersieuths. Less cer-
tain but almost as predictable was
the fact that Houston was interested
in Dan Pastorini. Strangely, names
like Moorhead, Kern, and Wooster
were late in making their appear-
ance. But such is the stuff that
drafts are made of,

Chis year, more so than most, the
draft was accompanied by a veritable
snowsionm of trading. Football's
answer to the old-style New York
Mets, the Ph ladelphia Bagles, pack-
ed off Norm Snead to the Vikings:
Green Bay parted with Travis Wil-
hams, and Don Horn getting Alden
Roche from Denver and Zeke Brat-
kowski from the Geritol Corpora-
tion. Oakland swapped Alvin Wyatt

ton semt Hoyle Granger to the Saints

But perhaps the biggest news of
the entire session was that mammoth
trade engineered by the Los Angeles
Rams and the Washington Redskins,
one of the largest exchanges of naw
flesh made in recent years. George
Allen, recently deposed as head man
of the Rams and now head coach for
the ’Skins, decided it would be much
easier to bring his own men than to
break in new ones, so he purchased

Pembroke Bows to W&L

By PALMER TRICE

In their last encounter in January,
the Generals faced the visiting squad
from Pembroke State. The Blue con-
tiued their Doremus streak, notching
a 64-56 victory. The win raised the
basketball team's record to 10-4, a
mark waich they carried imto the
game with U.Va. (See story, Page 1.)

At the outset of the Pembroke
game, the play of the two clubs was
sharp. When Pembroke slowly began
to pull away, they began to protect
their lead, by holding the ball. Down

from the floor, but hit 24 of 39
foul shots. While Pembroke shot a
better percentage than W&L, they
took 16 less foul attempts than
W&L, and made eight less. For the
firstt ime this year, one could hear
the Washington and Lee Swing. Play-
ing at home was, perhaps, the key
to the victory. The crowd support
was most vocal, perhaps causing a
few of the opposition's 19 turnovers.

Defensively, W&L used a match-
up, a half-court zone press, and a
three-quarter court press, the last
two in a successful attempt to upset
the tempo of the Pembroke offense.

The only sour note of the game
ocourred when big Paul McLure
fouled out late in the game. At the
time, he had contributed 10  re-
bounds.

But when the shouts had died and
the W&L Swing faded, it was a
happy Canfield team which trotted
off the court with a 64-56 win. They
knew they deserved it.

This evening the Generals return
home to Doremus following last
night's jaunt to Charlottesville. Tra-
ditional foe Hampden-Sydney will
serve as the opposition as Washing-
ton and Lee seeks to add to its
budding home court winning skein.

novice mentor, Tommy Prothro. But
if the ‘Skins don't put it together
next year, it will be Allen wiping
egg off his face. After all, unlike
quarterbacks, hinebackers don’t live
forever and Pottios, Baughan and
Pardee at 32, 32, and 34 aren't spring
ghickens. On the other hand, the
Rams recognizing rebuilding as theit
objective, have obtained some choice
draft positions
Chalk one up for Prothro.

Tough Schedule

W&L’s hghly touted Lacrosse
squad faces a rugged 14 game sched-
ule this March in its quesi for high
national rankings.

The Generals, ranked 17th na-
tionally in one poll, are sel to start
play against Randolph-Miacon on
Sacurday, March 20. The contest is
one cf six home games currently on
iad for the team.

Coach Dick Slaza’s squad, which
returns All-America selection Whit-
ney Morrill and Bill Brumback,
team scoring leader Sam Englehart
and a hosi of lettermen, engages
several touring teams during the
course of the season.

On March 22, the Blue will play
host to a selected group of All-Stars
representing English colleges. Later
that week, Darimouth, an Ivy
League team, will visit Lexington.

The Minks will engage in an ex-
tensive road trip dunng the spring
vacaiton—fac.ng Wesleyan, the Uni-
versity of Connecticut, and national
co-champion Navy.

The University of Virginia, which
shared the national title with the
Middies and Johns Hopkins last
year, is also on the schedule, along
with strong North Carohina, which
barely shaded the Generals in a wild
Willson Field tilt a year ago.

for so very |iitle, and they give so
very much, The least we can do back
home is just to give them the sup-
port, the love, the dignity, and the
respect that they, our flag, and our
country deserve.”

lhe heroes of “No Substitute For
Viciory” are | men who have
fought in Vietnam. Their staunchest
supporter is the filim’s John
Wayne. Whether expressing his love
for “this great nation of ours” o1
his anger at “the Commun.st Con
spiracy,” the “liberal Senators,” of
the advocates of “appeasement and
peace at any price” who have pro-
longed the Oscar-w.nning
actor never hesitaies to express his

most,

war, the

Viows.,

Bill Mollhany, a
W&L and Chairman of
Lexington T.R.A.I.N. Comm:ttee,
Wiich is sponsoring the showing,
said: “For a t:me, it seemed preity
lonely advocating victory against the
Communists. Propagandists in this
country somehow had convinced
many Americans that this war was
different, that victory was impossible
or undesirable, that some sort of un-
easy truce or shameful accommoda
tion was the only solution. We are
proud anl appy to be able to call
John Wayne and all these other
famous Americans our allies. We
certainly agree that in war, there is
no substitute for vietory!”

The T.R.A.L.N,. Committee, which
is part of a nationwide network spon-
sored and guided by The John Birch
Soviety, was formed to support
Amerioan fighting men, to imeorease
respect for the United States, and
to halt all aid to our Communist
enenvies,

lickets for the Premier Showings
of “No Substitute For Victory” can

Ilhany, P.O. Box 116, Lexington,
Phone 463-4631; or at the ticket

WAL T.R.A.LN. will be selling

each far adults and $1.00 each for

mended obiaining them in advance.

The T.R.A.LN. Chairman also
revealed that imoome from these

expenses for production and promo-
tion of the movie, and that none

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

(Continued from Page 2)
Training “leads to an animoalisiic,
mob response. It is a powerful form
of Pavlovian conditioning—condi-
tioning by which sexual and emo-
tional types of response can be sub-
stauted for intellectual considera-
tion.”

Dr. Michael J. Singer, a Long
Beach, California, psychiatrist, says:
“There is danger of serious psycho-
logical damage rather than benefit
from this type of group... meet-
ings, particularly if an emotionally
disturbed person in this group is
not being treated by a fully qualified
and trained psychotherapist.” One
might doubt the ability of ministers
or social workers or students to spot
this type of troubled individual be-
fore further damage is done, in view
of what Dr. Ross Sydner, Professor
of Religious Education and Pastoral
Psychology at Chicago Theological

Seminary, has said: “There are great
dangers that can be done by people
who do noi know what they are
doing. You get things roused up
that you might not have the know!l-
edge to really cope with. It is clear
that nobody, including the psychia-
trist, knows how to work with teen-
You may tear a teen-ager
wpart w.thout knowing that you are
do.ng it.” It seems that once-nonmal
adults can also be terribly upset by
this process! and the following quote
is from an article in the Wall Street
Journal for July 14, 1969: “One
executive, who went to Esalen on
his own hook, became so deeply
effected by the experience that he
quit his job. For a while he worked
as a dishwasher at Esalen .. . Now,
and then, a participant in Sensiti-
vicy Training wil crack under the
barrage of personal criticism and
analysis. One big company in the

agers.

Midwest stopped all Sensitivity
Iraining after a vice-president suf-
ferred a total breakdown during a
session and had to enter a mental
hospital. Fear of damage to the
mental health of employees has
taken ovher finms out of Sensitivity
Draining.”

Helping to bear all of this out
are the typical examples provided
by parents in Evanston, Llinois, con-
cerning the all-too-common results
of Sensitivity. One mother said her
daughter became hysterical. Others
said their teenagers were unable to
sleep. One boy reported that, after
an evening stint of blanket-crawling
and bred-passing, he found himself
on a street several blocks from his
heuse at 3 A.M. with no recollection
of even getting out of bed. Perhaps
you can understand now why promi-
nont psycholog'sis, like Dr. Everett
L. Shostrom, warn: “Never partici-
pate in a group encounter with close
associates. Never participate in a
group that lacks formal connection

with a {professional (doctor) on
whom you can check.”

It is interesting that the same
“sensiivily training” methods have

been used in such places as Nazi
Germany and Communist China in
order to guarantee obedience to
those respective Establishments. (On
this see: Dr. J.A.M. Merloo, “The
Rape of the Mind,” N.Y.: Grosset
and Dunlap, 1956; and the chapter
on criticism and self-criticism in Mao
Tse-tung’s “Quotations,” just to name
a couple.) It gets even more interest-
img when we see the Rockefeller
and Ford Foundations financing
N.T.L., Esalen and private sensi-
tivity programs, along with generous
help from Nixon's H.E.W. Depart-
ment and the O.E.O. It's hard to
get unconstitutional crime laws pass-
ed unless enough chaos, orime and
animalistic behavior is going on.

What do the brain benders have
in mind for the future? In August,
1967, Dr. Stanley Less told the
International Congress of Psychiatry
alized and anyone who tries to be
that society will become deperson-
an individual “will be looked upon
as odd, reactionray and antigroup.”
According to the Professor, “un-
animity of thinking would be seen
as the normal pattern.” Sensitivity
Training is an important part of
this scheme. Don't let them steal
your mental independence.

members at the rate of 32 per year
if he is to match the record of his
predecessor, Dean Pusey. Watt fore-
shaowed no changes in the hiring-
firing policy and noted that in the
future the time-honored practice of
fade-away contracts would serve in
the stead of outright dismissal.

“I have no ideas for any radical
change,” he said, “although if any-
thing is indicated by my experience
as Associate Dean, chianges will oc-
cur, My prime responsibility is to
make the changes we have work.”

An important task of the new
Dean will be his participation on
the University Council. The Council,
consisting of 12 students, 12 faculty,
and 4 dears will have final authority
on student affairs not regulated by
the yet-to-be-organized Student
Senate and will serve as a forum for
student grievances. Watt said he
thought the Council ‘would be quite
useful in broadening the understand-
ing of the University’s problems
among students.”

An understanding of the ROTC
issue will most likely be first on the
agenda when the Council meets.

Having titular responsibility for
maintaining academic standards, the
Dean of the College will have an
important voice in the debate over
credit for the ROTC department,
and, should a de-credited ROTC
establishment announce a unilateral
withdrawal as it did at the Uni-
versity of Virginia, the new Dean
may face his first baptism by fire.

Flurry Of Cold Checks

(Continued from Page 2)

times many of the merchants even
try to hold checks for a while, in
hopes that the students will come
by and settle up on their own. But
a business like, say, the CO-OP
sometimes is down $300 in bad
checks in a period of one or two
weeks.”

Even though many students in-
stinctively resent a university com-
mittee “prying” invo their financial
affairs, the juo‘‘fication of the com-
mittee’s actions is obvious. Hope-
fully studen‘s can make an effort to
remember that the carelessness of a
minority does indeed jeopardize their
freedom to cash checks and to main-
tain accounis.
