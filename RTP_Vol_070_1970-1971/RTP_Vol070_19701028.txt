Large Turnout Expected During Parents’ Weekend;
Student Activity Forum To Highlight Innovations

BY SKIP PAUKERT

Well over 1,000 parents are ex-
pected to descend upon Lexington
this Friday and Saturday for the 16th
annual Parents’ Weekend.

Formal and informal visits with
faculty members, two home athletic
contests, campus tours, and a variety
of social events will be included

“Our major purpose will be to
allow parents to ask their questions
about the changes that have oc-
curred at Washington and Lee and
to explain why we're unique among
educational institutions,” said Mr.
Jerry Poudrier, assistant director of
development and coordinator of the
weekend,

On Friday afternoon from 3:30-
5:00 p.m., parenis may meet with a

udent panel led by Student Bo!)
President Fran Lawrence, designed,
says Mr. Poudrier, “to provide the
stimulating discussion afforded by a
small group and to allow parents to
get things off their chests.”

The success of last year's Friday
-vening dinner in the cockpit has led
to the establishment of a second

dinner on Saturday night. Dinner
will be followed by entertainment
ranging from the Sazeracs to folk
music and a magic show, all per-
formed by W&L students. Students
can make reservations for the din-
ner at $2.50 per person in the Uni-
versity Center.

Parents will begin registration at
10 a.m. Friday morning, and Mr.
Poudrier emphasized the importance
for parents to go to the Fairfax
Lounge in the Student Center to
register immediately upon their ar-
rival. At 2:30 Friday the Parents’
Advisory. Council will meet in the
University Center, and the R.O.T.C.
building will open its doors for an
open house.

The first athletic match of the
weekend will be the Varsity Soccer
game between W&L and William
and Mary on the upper athletic field
mi 3:15.

The McCormick Library will be
open and a tour from 4-5:00, will be
followed at 5:00 with the weekly
Chemistry Department seminar in
Howe Hall 401. Speeches by Chem-

Troubadours
To Present
‘Billy Budd’

“Billy Budd,” an adaptation of
Herman Melville's novel, will be
presented by the Troubadour Thea-
tre November 4-7. This play, written
by Coxe and Chapman, marks the
opening production of the Trowba-
dours’ 1970-71 season.

The basic thrust of the play, lke
Melville's novel, is the continuin:
struggle between good and evil.
Billy Budd, a young and handsome
stilor, is the perfect innocent; he
can see only the good in life. Bil)
even fails to recognize the evil in
John Claggart, the vicious Master-
at-Arms who personifies the wors!
side of man’s nature. Because of his
fury at Billy's lack of fear for him
Claggart accuses Billy of leading a
munity plot.

Billy has one weakness: he stam-
mers when he is nervous. When he
is confronied by Claggari’s untrue
accusation, Billy is unable to speak
up and defend himself. In his im-
potent fury, Billy strikes Claggart
and kills him.

Troubadour director Ellen Barnes
has altered the conclusion of the play
somewhat. The Coxe hapman work
ends with Billys hanging. Mfrs.
Barnes has added a final pantomime
scene in which the shep’s officers exit
and the crew resumes their duties.

With this ending, Mrs. Barnes
makes the point that, although good
and evil may contend against each
other, the basic monotony of life
goes on unaffected. This point is dis-
tinctly lacking in the Coxe and
Chapman original: it is, father, the
director's own interpretation

Although the theme of the play is
dark. and is perhaps made even more
so by the directors added conciu
sion, “Billy Budd” is not without
its momenis of humor, though ii too
form of Diack comedy. The
whole crew has scenes of erim hu
mor, while the priggshness of Gar
diner provides the crew as well as
the audience with moments of calm
in the harsh tone of the drama

Page 2 THE RING-TUM PHI

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

October 28, 1970

A Unique Suggestion

“We must
retain the traditional
strengths that, over the years,
have made Washington and Lee
the institution .
that it is.”
—Dean Lewis G. John
Magazine of Washington and Lee
Winter, 1970

One of the “traditional strengths” which Washington and
Lee has offered students ever since the passing of General
Robert E. Lee is its student-administered Honor System, We
wonder whether at this time next year Dean John will be able
to write of the Honor System as a “traditional strength’ —ex-
cept in the past tense.

In the future the Honor System at Washington and Lee
may be no longer an attitude, a simple code of ethics held by
the students; it may become a handbook of about 50 pages of
rules and regulations outlining the skeletal structure of a fos-
silized straw horse which was beaten to death with the an-
guished cries of those who want a “break” for their “fellow
man.”

We find little grains of reasoning behind the odious sugges-
tion that those who have violated the gentlemanly code of con-
duct should be allowed to return to Washington and Lee after
a year’s probation, Does a year away from Lexington provide
the proper time span for an offender to realize that “W&L’s
Honor System was right; | was wrong; a gentleman does not
lie, cheat, or steal; henceforth I will live by the System; and
| will carry The Word back to the students of Washington and
Lee!”? Or perhaps those who would want to dilute the penalty
of expulsion with teardrops think that “ethics are a good thing
to have around and they make for a meaningful atmosphere in
a college environment, but... they can be a hang-up for a lot
of people.”

Should the newly formed Honor System committee decide
to institute this death blow to the simple, effective code of gen-
tlemanly conduct here at Washington and Lee and the stu-
dents approve, we would demand that the University not re-
admit offenders after a year’s probation. But this action prob-
ably will not be necessary if the Honor System Committee re-
members that their freedom as students lies in their collective
responsibility as a committee,

So we submit to that committee our own little suggestion
about the Honor System: keep it (the way it is).

A Letter From The Editor

To the students of Washington and Lee University ;

After two months of publishing The Ring-tum Phi, we
have come to a somewhat less-than-startling conclusion:
Washington and Lee students have absolutely no opinions.
This assertion may appear a bit rash on paper, yet what other
conclusion can we draw when we find that week after week of
publishing the newspaper, no letters to the editor have been
submitted ?

We know the following to be given facts: (a) students can
read; (b) students can write: (c) students know what The
Ring-tum Phi is; (d) students have Seen (perhaps read) at
least one copy of this year’s newspaper; and (e) students
realize they may submit letters to the editor in the office in
Reid Hall or by mail to Box 899, Lexington, Va.

Therefore what other conclusion can we deductively reason
from the following facts than that students have no opinions?
Dommage.

In Praise Of Local Color

The Ring-tum Phi was threatened with a law suit last week
because we asked a question of a local merchant in town whom
we had heard was involved with the City of Lexington over
a monetary dispute. He told us in so many words that anything

The

we printed would be used against us in court because it was
hearsay. We told him that if we were intending to print any
hearsay, we wouldn't be there to ask him the particulars. He
wouldn't comment upon the questions we asked of him so
we left without a story.

But not without a tranche de vie, a la Lexington. Can you
imagine any other place in the world a man, wearing a busi-
ness suit and a $10 tie, would threaten a student while the
merchant's trousers were between his waist and his knees as he
was attempting to tuck his shirt-tail in? We may not attend
college in the best of all possible environments, but something
has to be said for our local color,

(Editor's Note: Normally it has

Parking Lot Space At Premium;

Construction Continues Elsewhere

BY MIKE HOUCK

Parking has traditionally been a
problem at Washington and Lee,
and this year, with the influx of
freshman cars, the parking situa-
tion is more acute than ever. Places
near campus are at a premium, and
it is often simpler to walk than at-
tempt to find a convenient space.

In an attempt to alleviate parti-
ally the parking squeeze, the Uni-
versity began construction of three
new parking lots at the end of last
year with plans for having them
open by the beginning of classes this
fall. These lots include an area with
a capacity for 85 cars near Liberty
Hall, a 37 car addition to the Lee
Chapel lot, and two new terrace
parking lots behind the Gym with a
combined capacity of 145 cars,

ge: Interest

somewhat of an experience in co-
education?

Dean Elke Frank: Actually the
program in which Mary Baldwin is
taking part had nothing to do with
sex. Our physics program at Mary
Baldwin was somewhat lacking, we
felt. We encouraged our students
who were interested in pursuing a
study in physics to go to a school
that had a stronger program.

The concept of pooling resources
is not something new. Amherst and

Mock Convention Merits Outweigh Ills

BY ROY CARLTON

At the risk of allying myself with
the rapidly diminishing numbers of
traditionalists on this campus, and
thereby losing all credibility, | can-
not help but take issue with Mr. Ba-
roody’s suggestions regarding the
Mock Convention which appeared
in the October 21 edition of The
Ring-tum Phi. There is a second
danger inherent in such a task. It is
altogether possible that my remark-
ably poor sense of humor has failed
to detect that Mr. Baroody’s exposi-
tion was merely an attempt at satiric
levity. However, despite the lack of
any valid criticisms of the Mock
Convention, | was unable to find
anything which could be considered
amusing by even the broadest stand-
ards,

Aside from the standpoint of tra-
ditionalism, the Mock Convention
has numerous merits, perhaps more
so because of the archaic nature of
the convention system. The concept
of the Washington and Lee Mock
Convention has never been such that
it was an opinion poll of the stu-
dent body. Rather, it is an attempt to
recreate the aura of the convention,
where political manipulation is of
the essence.

No one at the W&L convention is
ever involved in mimicking Order of
the Moose buffoons, unless of course,
Mr. Baroody was. Rather, through
months of research and constant
comtact with the party delegations
and bosses of each state, students
begin to appreciate the inner work-
ings of political machinery.

If a student should choose to be
an activist, it is only through such
an understanding that he can pos-
sibly hope to affect the decision-mak-
ing of a national party. Mr. Baroody
is correct in asserting that the na-
tional party convention is both ar-
chaic and undemocratic, but the al-
logation that it is a thing of the past
is absurdly naive. lt is such a mis-
understanding of the concepts of
power politics that led to the bitter
frustrations of the McCarthy sup
porters at the 1968 Democratic Con
vention. The lessons learned in the
conduct of such a realistic endeavor
«s the W&L Mock Convention can
only help a student in his attempts
to institute popular sovereignity or
elect the candidate of his choice.

The viability of the national con-
vention is unquestionable. Despite
increasing numbers of primaries
throughout the land, it is still at the
party convention where the nomi-
nees are chosen, Witness the nomina
tion of Barry Goldwater in 1964 and
Hubert Humphrey in 1968, Al
though perhaps not having the sup
port of the majority of Republicans,
by shrewd political dealing the Gold
water forces were able to forge an
overwhelming majority of delegates
Ditto concerning the 1968 Demo
cris. Humphrey's popular forces
were perhaps somewhat larger, but
not to the degree thal his conven
ion displayed

The WAL convention abounds
with such political intrigue, As cut
and dried as it may seem to the
freshman, the outcome is usually in
doubt, Otherwise the Reagan, Rocke
feller, and Nixon forces in 1968
would not have spent all the money
they did to win the 1968 Mock Con
vention, The Reagan forces
rumored to have spent almost $10,

were

000. Contacts such as these with the
hidden levels of politics are a broad-
ening experience for the W&L stu-
dent.

Among Mr. Baroody’s lesser argu-
ments he contends that the Conven-
tion costs too much, and that no
student should be assessed. Let it
be pointed out that students are not
assessed for the Convention. Money
is raised through private contribu-
tions. The publicizing effect for
Washington and Lee of such fund
raising is in itself enough reason for
holding the convention.

The authenticity of the W&L
event is unassailable, Not only does
it usuafly reflect the eventual na-
tional convention nominee, but it is
substantially accurate with respect
to the voting of the individual state
delegations. Perhaps Mr. Baroody
will shed a tear at the absence of the
National Guard next year, but then
again, even terrorism and a full-
scale riot in downtown Chicago
couldn't affect the 1968 Democrats.

The City/

I can only express regret that Mr.
Baroody did not find the 1968 Wash-
ington and Lee Mock Convention
to be either entertaining or en-
lightening. | can assure him that
many did. If the convention “de-
generated into an exercise in bore-
dom and bad taste” that is probably
because national conventions are by
nature garish. His contact with the
inner workings of the convention was
probably limited. As a freshman
there are relatively few opportunities
for involvement in the convention.
This, of course, is regrettable. How-
ever, I remember well from 1968
that there were three state chairman-
ships left open for which freshmen
were eligible. The higher one climb-
ed in the convention heirarchy, the
more learning opportunities were
presented. It is difficult to criticise
the Mock Convention for its failures
when one’s participation is only sup-
erficial. The Mock Convention is
like anything else. You get out of
it according to what you put in it.

Presently only the Liberty Hall
area and the small terrace behind
Doremus are in use, while construc-
tion is proceeding slowly on the
other lots. Douglas Brady, Superin-
tendent of Buildings and Grounds,
explains that completion dates on
the facilities were not met because
the parking problem has not been as
serious as was originally expected.
Spaces were planned for 150 fresh-
man cars, but the number thus far
has been significantly lower. The Li-
berty Hall area is seldom used be-
cause of its distance from campus,
and most of the freshmen have evi-
dently decided to park either in back
of the dorms or behind Doremus.

Work on the Lee Chapel lot is
ontinuing, and the area should be
ready before December.

Pooling

Smith and other Ivy League
schools have pooled together in a
consortium. I think that we are re-
alizing that as technology increases
and demands for expensive equip-
ment increases, schools have to pool
together their resources in order to
supply more and better opportuni-
ties for entering college students.

As you can see, the consortium
isn't meant to be an experience in
coeducation whatsoever. We treat
students—be they male or female—
as students.

R-t Phi: What if a male student
decides he wants to come to Mary
Baldwin to study for four years?
Would you accept him?

Frank; No—he would be unhappy
because of the lack of a social life.

R-t Phi: But under the philosophy
you mentioned of treating students
as students, would you accept him?

Frank: In our charter, we are
a woman's college. But we certainly
could accommodate a male student
if he could show that he wanted to
come to study specifically at Mary
Baldwin.

R-t Phi: What are your feelings
about the women’s liberation move-
ment?

Frank: | think women should be
treated as persons. They can do any-
thing a man can do professionally.

We have to combat the fact thai
a girl should first and foremost get
married, be a housekeeper and a
good mother. It was important for a
woman to be domestic at one time,
but I think we have passed those
times. With the technological devices
available for the home now, a wo-
man doesn't have to be a full-time
homemaker.

Letters

To the Editor &

Fodor’s Tribute to Lee

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Please allow me to take up a little “We

of your time and troubling you with

this letter. I assure you that I will

be short and simple. October 5 |
had perhaps the greatest honor in
my life—that is being in Lexington,
Virginia and to pay honor and re-

spect to one of the greatest Ameri- 4

cans of the time—the late General
Robert Edward Lee and the late
President of Washington and Lee
University. | speak, or rather write,
alone and speak for no one but my-
self,

The shame is that no one from
Washington, D.C., the seat of our
nation, was there to pay the respect
to the good man, great man, and
Godly man which Robert Edward
Lee was. I am remembering not one
but all‘ the leaders from the North,
the East, the West, and the South.
Where were they? Were they too
god, to proud, and too big to show
themselves?

If the President could not be there,
why could he not send some one to
speak for him and the nation, Again
I blame both parties and say it is a
shame. I love my country and have
fought for it and offered my life for
her but I am not too proud of some
of her leaders.

This nation will never know no
more men such as Robert Edward
Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and so on.
I believe if we had such as they we
would have a better country and na-
tion and a better world. I assured
you that I would not try to take up
too much of your time. If 1 have or
had I ask your pardon. The honor
and pleasure was all mine.

| Markin gs.

 

BY ROBERT BAROODY

Last week I heard the stery of a
man who believes that bugs are at-
tempting to “take over” the world
from man, its legitimate owner. This
is something most people don’t think
about, concerned as they are with
the insignificant features of their
neurotic and paranoid lives. Pity. It
might be too late to discuss academi-
cally such an ominous threat to our
human depravity. Even as I write
this, a common housefly—insolent
to the sweep of my pen, oblivious to
the weight of these words—creeps
across the page, scampers to this sen-
tence, and deposits its filth here. . .
Accursed beast! Punctuation is not a
personal strength. What’s more, you
are probably a scout for the enemy.

Seriously. Have you noticed the
recent upsurge in the insect popula-
tion explosion, particularly amongst
houseflies? I have, and it’s getting
worse. Instead of their seasonal hib-
ernation, several busy members of
the vanguard are already laying
away the ammunition for a gigantic
spring offensive.

How to combat the insect men-
ace? Poison gas, germ warfare, ster-
ilization; these methods are all
doomed to failure. There is, how-
ever, some hope: a friend of mine
has, over his twenty-one years, per-
fected a sure-fire technique in the
art that is fly extermination. Upon
spying the unfriendly, this fellow
seizes a paperback book and silently
slithers to within two feet of ground
zero. Poised, fingers tensed, wrist at
a Classic 20 degree angle to the swat-
ting surface, he sadistically mutters
“Die bug.” An instant later the
enemy ceases to bee, smeared as it
is on the cover of The Way of Life
by Lao Tse. This man claims that to

 

Insects of the World Unite

insure a 9:1 kill ratio one must use
a lightweight paperback, no more
than half an inch thick, excluding,
of course, The Lord of the Flies.

There are those who do not
possess a copy of The Way of Life.

Imagine if you will this scene in
the emergency situation room of a
Great World Power: There is an
endless flow of administrative sub-
ordinates, each of whom has a fresh
international disaster to report to
che Great World Leader. Through
an open window in dances a carefree
‘bumblebee. As the group of flunkies
hastily retreat, the Great World
Leader lashes out against God’s crea-
tion with How to Win Friends, Make
Money, Enjoy Life, Etc. . . . He
misses his mark; the bee, incensed,
does not. Coincidentally, the hot
line buzzes (sic, sick) with the news
that the bad guys have upset the
economy in northeastern Luxem-
bourg. “That does it” shrieks the
Great World Leader, “Bombs
Away!”

But all this is rubbish. Bugs have
no claim to the Socratic method;
their intelligence is distinctly non-
linear. They do not know the facts,
which are, that after exposure to
600 roentgens of radiation man mis-
erably bleeds to death; insects are
still happy with 100,000 roentgens.
Thus, that beetle crawling up your
Stay-prest tie (or his direct descend-
ants) might be alive and well a few
years hence, munching and crunch-
ing on your glowing corpse. Right
on.

sion, a swimming power. They have
been led by several All-Americans,
the latest of which is Bill Brumback.
Brumback, who has held this honor
for the past two years, is this year's
captain. He is a senior, who holds
the school record in the 50 and the
100 meter freestyle.

Coach Bill Stearns says that this
year’s team is one of the most dedi-
cated that he has ever coached.
Practice started 3 weeks ago. At that
time, there were 37 people out for
the team. After sampling the Coach’s
rugged conditioning, there remain
20 ruged performers, They practice
twice a day, swimming between 10
ind 15 miles a week. This is suposed
to be about twice as much as the
swimmers covered last year. Of the
twenty, 11 are freshman. They will
participate in a full schedule of
Junior Varsity meets,

Coach Stearns lost but two of his
last year’s performers. They were
Roger Martin and Scott MacElroy.
Aside from Brumback, there will be
several swimmers from whom great
things will be expected. One of these
is junior Bim Clark. Bim swims the
100 and the 200 dolphin butterfly.
n the 100 he holds both the schoo!
and the conference record. He is
also one of the versatile swimmers
who gives the squad needed depth.
Burt Meem, last year’s Most Improv-
ed Swimmer, returns. His specialties
are the distance freestyle and the
dolphin butterfly stroke. Another
junior, Rick Sands, is another versa-
tile performer, who should provide
good performances in the breast-
stroke and the individual medley.
Other returnees include Alan Cor-

th, conference record holder in
the 400 individual medley, Price
Blackford (100 and 200  breast-
stroke), Eddie Haslam, and Aven
Sharp. The leading freshman is
Steve Erickson, a high school All-

American from Abingdon, Pennsyl-
vania, Who is swimming now at the
pace of Bill Ball, a W&L All-Ameri-
can two years ago.

This year’s schedule is one of the
toughest in a long while. Among
the teams that the General swim-
mers will face are William and
Mary, which won the state meet last
year, Duke, Johns Hopkins, V.M.I.,
and Va, Tech. The University of
Virginia will be, according to Coach

 

Stearns, “our toughest meet.” The
season starts with Old Dominion,
here, on December 4th. The team’s
season ends with the CAC cham-
pionships, which will take place on
February 25-27, at Lexington, in
the V.M.I. pool.

Despite a lack of depth and of
diving, the Generals have looked
good in practice, and look forward
to the season, the CAC champion-
ships, and for some, the National
Championships.

Football Bounces...

WA&L should get some kind of na-
tional “Homecoming” award. The
Generals’ game at Western Mary-
land Saturday was their fourth
straight Homecoming contest. In-
cluded in that stretch was W&L’s
Homecoming, which the Generals
lost, and the 35-34 spoiler of Tufts
Homecoming. And guess when
Southwestern of Memphis is having
its Homecoming? On Nov. 7, when
the Lynx entertain W&L, of course.

Too Much TV Ball?

     
   

suits, each carrying briefcases. The
Manhattan skyline is hazily visible
through high, smudged windows. An
older but equally distinguished busi-
nessman takes his seat at the head of
the table.

The occasion is not a meeting of
President Nixon's cabinet, nor a top-
secret session of Lexington’s City
Council. However, the convocation
deals with yet another pair of Ameri-
can institutions—those of football
and television. The executives have
met several times already to ponder
what may be (at least this year) an
unanswerable question: has football
over-saturated its market? The tele-
vision execs seem to be concerned,
but according to those impartial
numbers of people from the Nielson
Company, they needn't be.

In the old days people felt that
there was already too much grid ac-
tion on the tube, what with a col-
lege game on Saturday and two on
Sunday. It was more than a sane
wife could bear. Today, though,
when you speak of a football week-
end, you're talking in terms of at
least five games.

ABC rarely broadcasts more than
one college game per Saturday, but
NBC and CBS together show three
programs each Sunday, And start-
ing this year, ABC branched out
into the week-day prime-time arena,
broadcasting a pro game every Mon-
day night. Naturally many of the
tube executives were a little leery
of the public’s reaction to so much
football; the other two networks
figured to capitilize on ABC's ex-
periment by showing a fine stock of
old movies. They figured that by
Monday almost everyone would pre-
fer Doris Day and Rock Hudson to
Len Dawson or Leroy Kelley. But as
the figures rolled in, ABC's daring
move began to reap good results,
Nielson ratings showed that the
games were outdrawing the rival
flicks by a goodly margin. Of course,
in T.V. terms, that means more
money from sponsors seeking to ad-
vertise their particular product to
the most people.

One of the biggest reasons for the
success f the Monday night games
has been the fact that many of the
contests have been more than just
average encounters. That is, many
of the Monday fare have been key
games. Cleveland-Kansas City, Chic-
ago-Detroit, and Minnesota-Los An-
geles have been important meetings.
Secondly, football is probably at its
peak of attraction, a peak that is
liable to remain high for the next
few years. Football has replaced
baseball as the national pastime, and
you know that went on for a long
time. The action found in the sport
appeals to the tempo of the times:
this is not likely to abate in the near
future.

All good things must come to an
end sooner of later, and this applies
to Monday night football, but |
think this prime4ime invasion will
probably be around for quite some
time. Football may have over-ex-
tended itself, but it has not over-
saturated its market. Not yet,

Soccer team battled VMI into overtime but lost, 4-3.

Booters Lose 4-3 To VMI

BY DAVID TORRANCE

Weathermen are always telling us
on the six o'clock news that we need
rain but one thing’s for sure: the
Generals didn’t need it last Wednes-
day, when, on thtt gloomy, rainy
day, they lost to V.M.I. 4-3 in over-
time. The Generals did a credible
job, though, it was a close game all
the way through. In the first period,
V.M.I. scored on a penalty kick,
but W&L tied wp the score in the
2nd with a goal by Brandon Her-
bert. Both teams scored in the 3rd
quarter, W&L’s being credited to
Mike Schaeffer. It looked like W&L’s
game in the first part of the last
period, when Carl Hyatt kicked in
another point for the Blue, but in
the last few minutes of the 4th quar-
ter, V.M.I. clinched it by scoring in
the first overtime, and by keeping
WAL scoreless in both overtime per-

The Generals had several things
working against them. First and fore-
most, was the weather, for during
the game it rained on and off. This
inclement weather surely hindered
the defense. Another thing working
against W&L was the fact that the
game was away at V.M.1. And also,
the Generals are a young team,
Which needed the experience that
this game provided them. Finally,
the offense failed to take advantage
of several good opportunities.

This leaves the Generals with a
1-6 record, with a win against Madi-
son, and losses to Dickinson, Lynch-
burg, the University of Virginia,
Roanoke, Eastern Mennonite, and
V.M.1. But this record does not do
justice to the WAL team. The first
two games, against Dickinson and
Lynchburg, were barely lost, both
by a score of 1-0. In the Eastern
Mennonite game, though the score
was 3-1, the Generals outplayed
their opponents. And finally, against
V.M.L., the Blues almost won.

On Thursday, the Generals go

against Hampden-Sydney, away, a

game in which the former has a good
chance for success. However, Wil-
liam and Mary, whom the Generals
play at home on Friday, will be
tough. They tied U.Va., which beat
W&L, so on Friday, anything can
happen. Then, in the first week of
November, there will be a game
with Jacksonville, which last year
was ranked fifth in the nation.

The Generals’ basic problem this
year has been the youth and inex-
perience of the team, for there are
only four seniors on the team, and
no juniors, In starting positions there
are 8 sophomores and freshman.
rhe squad is still working hard, and
on Thursday they will be able to
show Hampden-Sydney how much
experience they have gained.

’ Frank Brooks: from the bird’s nest...

Archie, Neer, Roadtrips

| don’t think Ole Miss’ loss two weekends ago will hurt
Archie Manning’s chances for the Heismann Trophy. He had
33 completions and over 300 total yards. SMU took the breaks
from Mississippi which is unusual in a 30-14 win. The Rebels
had statistics on their side, but you know what they say about

 
 

statistics and scores.

sy the way, Sports Information got a card in the mail from
Mike Neer who’s now playing ball in sunny Italy. Here’s a
little bit of what he said:

“Tam getting in shape by jumping up from the table and
fast-breaking to the nearest john. No wonder they never win a
war!

“The set-up seems great and as you can see there's a little
jump from Doremus to here. You'd think I was wearing the
Hope Diamond the way they cater to me, but It’s all O.K. since
I just nod and smile,

“The day after I arrived there was a big color front page
photo of yours truly which no doubt was used by every mama
in Italy to line the barbage cans. . .

Oh, probably, Mike.

Probably the most exciting sport at W&L has been road-
tripping. Today, however, it has slowed a bit and has become
far less sacred. I say this with a sense of loss, but I guess it’s
my fault as much as anyone’s.

| remember the good ole days when at any moment Frank's
or the Dalia would be packed. There were various contingents.
The Betas (Huntley, Joe, the Whip) were always at Frank's
praising their deeds on the bathroom walls. The KAs seemed
to always poke in and out here and there, remember ?

| was just a frosh when roading hit its peak (and simul-
taneously, its fall). My experiences centered around a small
group of guys, most of whom are nearly forgotten now : Billy

sall, Jo Jo Wich, Ralph Schenkel, Phil Thompson, Boogie
Baugher, Tom Groton. And those infamous ones like Tarumi-
anz, Nash Bogart, Cosel, Githelr, Sharpe, McMillan, Chew,
Pittman, whose paths were crossed on nearly every trip.

Those were the good ole days—before things got serious
and road-tripping lost its color.

We still do it. W&L will never lose the tradition. The Betas
hold on. The E’s do all right. Cur Ball, Honk, Ordell, Zooman,
and I—we still go, but its not the same. Frank's is still there.
There’s still good juke and plenty of Blues, Road, here I come.

THE RING-TUM PHI

W. Maryland Trips Generals, 37-21

A wide-open passing offense,
sparked by quarterback Steve Flu-
harty in the last two games, seems to
be the answer to half of the W&L
Generals’ losing problem: that of
scoring points. The unanswered half
is just preventing the opposition
from scoring. It was the latter that
turned out to be the downfall of the
Blue on Saturday as Western Mary-
land outscored W&L 37-21.

Fluharty’s passing, 24 completions
out of 36 attempts for 234 total
yards was the offense ignition. The
“Chief,” Steve Mahaffey, was on the
receiving end of 17 of those for 144
yards. Three Fluharty passes went
for touchdowns.

Receiving the opening kick-off,
Western Maryland moved from
their own 39 yard line to the W&L
4 in less than four minutes. A staunt

Cross Country
Over Davidson

The cross country team is 4 and
2 after beating Davidson and losing
to VMI in the tri-meet at Davidson.
The scoring between W&L and Da-
vidson was 24-33 and the score of
the meet with VMI was 15-50.

The performers were very good
considering the condition of the
course due to the rainy weather all
day. Bill Kalal, a freshman, led the
Generals with a time of 29:13 on
the Davidson 5 mile course. Bill
Wilkinson was second for the team
with a time of 29:17. The next two
finishers for the Generals at Sth and
6th were Tom Young and Bob Sher-
wood. Tom Young with a time of
30:16 has been constantly improv-
ing himself throughout the season;
he will be very aviuable in the CAC
meet on Nov, 7, in St. Louis.

Carter Glass finished 8th thus giv-
ing W&L the five places needed to
win. Jim Horner and Tim Kearney
placed 10th and 11th; both of these
runners are freshman and have been
turning in strong times on their
home course. Strong finishes were
viso turned in by Paul Wilber and
Mike Guroian.

Last Saturday, Bridgewater beat
the team 21-34 thus dropping W&L’s
record to 4 and 3. The best times of
the year were seen in this meet.
Placing 4th overall and Ist for the
team was Bill Kalal with a time of
24:19 on the home 4.1 course, Plac-
ing 2nd for the team and 6th over-
all was Bill Wilkinson; just behind
Wilkinson were Tom Young, Carter
Glass, and Jim Horner. The next
finishers for W&L were Paul Wilber,
Bob Sherwood and Doug MeNeil,
Mike Guroian came back with an-
other strong showing along with Tim
Kearney. Jim Haydon, Bill Rowe,
and Wayne Baker have turned in
consistent performances.

AOA OOOO OOOO

W&L goalline stand prevented six
points, but failed to stop three on a
twenty yard field goal. Punts filled
the stadium as the remainder of the
first quarter ran out with Western
Maryland in front, 3-0.

Just as the second quarter open-
ed the Generals took firm hold of a
Maryland punt on their own 40 and
marched the entire 60 yards to score
on Fluharty’s first touchdown pass,
18 yards to JoJo Martin, Mahaffey
hauled in four during the drive for
over half the yardage picked up.
Doug Chase’s conversion flung the
Blue into the lead 7-3.

The momentum stuck. On the
very next possession, W&L churned
55 yards to score on Fluharty’s sec-
ond touchdown toss, this one 18
yards to Bruce Green with 8:50 still
remaining in the half. Chappy Con-
rad's big reception of 15 yards to the
Maryland 18 set the score up. The
PAT was blocked but the Generals
held a very commanding 13-3, until
the half.

Western Maryland returned in

Player of the

 

the third quarter to score twice. The
momentum shifting, Maryland mov-
ed entirely on the ground from their
own 19 to the W&L 22. George
Harris intercepted their first pass at-
tempt at the 17 to seemingly end the
threat. But on the very next play,
Western intercepted a Fluharty pass
to the W&L 34. The ensuing call,

a 34 yard touchdown pass, put Mary-

land back into the game with 4:16
left in the quarter. The conversion
was good; the score 13-10 with the
Generals still in front.

Another Maryland drive, 69 yards,
again almost entirely on the ground,
put six more on the board on a
quarterback sneak of 2 yards, The
PAT put Western into a lead they
never relinquished, 17-13, with only
57 seconds left in the quarter.

WAL tried a comeback moving to
the Maryland 13 early in the fourth
quarter, the Generals poised for an
attempt to score. A Western fumble
recovery on the Maryland 10 dash-
ed all hopes of revival and the Blue
settled into discouragement. The fol-

lowing play saw the Maryland quar-
terback sneak 80 yards until he was
tripped up on the W&L 10. Two
plays later, a 7 yard TD run put the
game out of reach, 24-13.

Surprising everyone, the Generals
received the kickoff and waltzed 74
yards with the help of 2 penalties
and 4 pass completions, the last to
Chappy Conrad, for 10 yards from
Fluharty for the score. Mahaffey
snared the two point conversion and
the score squeezed closer, 24-21.

To add insult to injury, the Mary-
land team scored its last two touch-
downs on pass interceptions, one for
27 yards and the other setting up «
25 yard end run. One conversion
failed, the other was good and the
final score ended a runaway, 37-21.

On defense, exceptional play
came again from Marshall Wash-
burn, George Harris, and Dave
Brooks.

This week, the Generals return
home to a Parents’ Weekend crowd
against Sewanee at 2:30 on Satur-
day.

Senior end Frank Stearns noted
that the victory over Tufts was
W&L’s first on a “flying” trip in
Stearns’ four years on the team, de-
spite 2-3 airplane trips each year.
During that span, Stearns comment-
ed, all W&L victories have come
either at home or on shorter bus
trips.
