Lawrence McConnell. I must also
thank the staff this year for their
help and support, especially Roger
Munsick and Skip Paukert.”

Robinson continued, “I hope that
I will be able to improve the paper

the excellent job that this job de-
serves,”

quality of true strength, which will
be abiding.”

editors and business editors, Cole
added, “The Publications Board felt
the applicants as a group were all
qualified. We thank all those who
did apply. I personally feel those
chosen were very competent. They
should do an outstanding job for the
Publications Board and the school.”

the tradition established by their
forerunners. I believe they will try
and continue the improvement of

On Glee Club

BY PAUL WEEKS

| would first like to thank The
Ring-tum Phi for this opportunity
to write about the Washington and
Lee University Glee Club, mention-
ing services it performs and some of
the upcoming events concerning the
Club. The Glee Club is under the
direction of Mr. James T. Cook,
himself a W&L graduate, and con-
sists of a well balanced chorus of
about 30 men.

The Glee Club participates in a
variety of musical events both on
and off campus. For instance they
sang at the R. E. Lee Centennial
Commemoration service last Octo-
ber. Concerts have been held both
with the Mary Baldwin College
Choir and the Sweetbriar Choir. Off-
canypus, the Club has appeared at
local Churches for Sunday services,

If you happen to be in the vicinity
of the Student Center on a Monday
or Thursday from 7 - 8:30 p.m. you
will hear them practicing for the
four musical events coming up next
month.

In early May, the Glee Club, to-
gether with the Brass Choir and
members of the Troubadour, will
conduct a workshop at two neigh-
boring high schools. These are pilot
projects for a more extensive pro-
gram scheduled for the Spring of *72.
The program will operate under a
state grant. The object of these
workshops is to instruct and perform
for secondary schools, eventually
throughout the State.

A series of seminars concerned
with words and mywsic will be featur-
ed during the week of May 17.
These seminars sponsored by the
Glasgow Endowment will be con-
duct by Pulitzer Prize composer
Charles Wuorinin and the novelist
Reynolds Price who will be artists-
in-residence for that week, There
will be a concert on May 20 in
which the Glee Chub will assist. This
will be a program of student works
and works developed out of the
week's seminars,

The Chib's final performance of
the year will be a concert on May
27 featuring the Glee Club by it
self, Much work has been put into
this concert’s preparation. They have
added many new selections to their
repertory, Featured among these
new selections will be three Simon
and Garfunkel songs; a series of
short songs by William Latham bas
ed on sixth Century Latin poems
under the title “Song for a day Rome
was not built in” and “Nigra Sum”
by Pablo Selections from
“Hair” and songs by Cari Orff and
Schubert will also be included on
the program

Work will begin early next
and tryouts will be held as soon as
school opens for the incoming fresh
men and interested upperclassmen
A winter concert with Sullins is an
hcipated as well as a performance of
a major contemporary work with
Wilson College

All the year's effort will be
towards the concert tour which the
Chib is planning for the April 72
Spring Break. The target is a tour to
Puerto Rico. Contacts have

Independent Exams Approved
By University Council Vote

Fhe joint student-faculty Univer-
sity Council met for nearly three
hours Saturday morning to discuss
mainly two topics: the status of the
Independent Examination procedure,
and the issue of academic credit for
ROTC, The body passed a resolu-
tion calling for the continuation of
the independent exam system, but
took no official action on the ROTC
question.

Fhe meeting began with the pres-
entation of an argument against the
independent exam system by Mr.
John Gunn. “For most students the
examination period is the time of
their most intense study,” he said.
“The kind of learning acquired dur-
ing exams is not possible earlier [in
the term]; it is very different in
quality from his day-to-day prepara-
tion,”

Gunn continued, “The final exam
gives the student a chance to see it
ail in the perspective of complete
learning, leading up to an accumula-
tive whole. This can be a creative
learning exercise the student
needs an impartial, external review
of his work.”

EC Gets Annual Reports

Ihe Executive Committee receiv-
ed reports Monday night from sev-
eral of the standing subcommittees
on their past year's accomplishments
and future plans. Summaries were
offered by Henry Harkey of the Pin-
ancial Relations Committee, Roger
Munsick of the Curriculum Commit-
tee, and Mike McCall of the Stu
dent Planning and Development
Commitiee. The EC also heard from
Skip Nottberg on his recommenda-
tions for the future of the Dance
Board.

Harkey announced to the Com
mittee that $600 had been paid to
cover bounced checks since Febru
ary and that the year's total will

reach $2300 to cover student finan-
cial error, The signs which the Fin-
ancial Relations Committee install-
ed earlier in local businesses, warn-
ing students to check their bank bal-
ance before writing a check, worked
only for a brief period. Harkey said
he was discouraged with educational
programs and fines, and he outlined
a procedure to take cold check of-
fenders more severely to task.
Harkey suggested retaining the
present (up to $5) fine for first of
fenders, With regard to those up for
a second offense, who form the bulk
of this year’s increased negligence,
he recommended that the committee
be permitted the option of putting

It would follow that third offend-
ers could have their accounts closed
until “appropriate” correction of the
problem be made, this being the de-
termination of the bank concerned.
After considerable discussion on the
matter of out-of-town banks and the
issue §=Of merchant “blacklists,”
Fran Lawrence said that the Finan-
cial Relations Committee ought to
be allowed to establish a “credit re
liability” list at their own discretion,
which would expose the names of
those students who possessed a “bad
financial track record.” This way, it
was pointed out, the stigma of dam
aging a student's future credit rating
could be avoided.

Munsick reported for the Curri
culum Committee that a compilation
of the Teacher Evaluation Survey
was being retarded by a failure of
more than half of those questioned
to respond. He suggested that if
those who have not yet replied could
be urged to do so soon the survey
could result in comyputed data some

Phe Economics professor went on
to conclude that “the student should
know as litthe about the examina-
tion’s content before hand as pos-
sible. That means there must be no
comment whatever.” Gunn cited a
case in which a student confessed to
him last term that he had not both-
ered to study for a final because he
had heard that it was not difficult,

“Final examinations under the
conditions we have just finished are
unsatisfactory.” Gunn added that
value judgments are a natural im-
pulse on the part of a student, and
therefore he resolved that their pre-
clusion constituted an “unreasonable
demand on the students.”

Dr. John DeVogt countered this
argument by saying that there really
exists no alternative to the independ-
ent exam procedure under the pre-
sent schedule. Dean Atwood of the
Commerce School pointed out that
several plans had been devised under
a slightly altered schedule which
would allow sufficient time for a
fixed exam system; it was remarked,
however, that under such circum-
Stances all students would have to
twke two exams on at least one of
the days during the period.

Dr. Edward Pinney defended the
new exam system: “I think no one
expected, when we instituted this
system, that we would have absolute
security. With regard to its relative
seourity, | think it has worked very
well, if not distinction.”

Presiding chainman Fran Law-
rence pointed out that in one respect
the independent exams were a strain
on the Honor System, “but on the
other hand it strengthens it” by mak-
ing students more careful and more
aware of their behavior,

“There's no question that the in-
dependent exams are helpful,” re.
marked Steve Robinson. “It allows
students to study according to
the difficulty of their course.” Bob
Carrere lauded the new Operation as

 

“tailoring exams to students own
study habits.”

Gunn protested that Lawrence and
the EC had given their assurances
to the faculty at the time the plan
was accepted that students would
not jeopardize the system by mak-
ing comments about the tests. The
Council finally recommended 21-0
(with four abstentions) that the fac-
ulty approve the Independent Exam
procedure for next year.

In other business, the following
questions were submitted for Coun-
oil consideration: “Is military train-
ing inconsistent with academic edu-
cation?” and “is it in conflict with
academic values?”

Chemistry professor Imeson sug-
gested that it was, indeed, in the
public interest “to provide a civilian
attitude in the lower echelons of the
armed services,”

Dean Atwood, who heads the ad-
visory committee for the Military
Science unit, pointed out that the
university is under contract to pro-
vide some credit for ROTC courses,
and that, even if this were amended,
“the unit would probably disappear
in a few years.” He added that the
unit's presence on campus was also
“a good insurance program for our
own selfish reasons of operation” in
the case that college draft defer-
ments should ever be abolished.

Dr. H. Robert Huntley questioned
whether ROTC staff members re-
ceive the same scrutiny upon hiring
as other members of the faculty, and
he urged that all courses be open to
iMterested students, whether inside
or outside the ROTC program.

The University Council will again
meet in the EC room of the Student
Center Saturday morning. Among
topics to be discussed are the aquisi-
tion of the university's proxy on
stock for summer meetings and

lobbying efforts, the possibility of
#bolishing the grade F, and the pol-
icy of sending grades home to par-
ents,

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
April 28, 1971

From An Ever Writer
To A Sometimes Reader

“One of the most alluring temptations for any human in-
stitution is for it to consider itself as the Ptolemaic (e.g.)
center of a social universe. And this temptation has always
been doubly attractive for The Ring-tum Phi, for its editor and
staff have the somewhat titanic responsibility of accumulating
all the weekly news and opinion of Washington and Lee and
aranging its content on six sheets of newsprint 14 inches wide
and 20 inches long.”

We find it hard to believe that we wrote that windy rhetoric
April 29, 1970. A year has gone all-too-quickly past us
And now we have a new editor-in-

on
since our first newspaper,
chief for this glorious rag.

From this day forth this newspaper will be in the extremely
capable hands of John Robinson, although we'll still be using
these columns for editorial comment now and then. But our
job is, for the most part, at an end.

We would like to think that we've succeeded at our job
because we were read. But John Robinson's thoughts for the
coming year indicate that he’s done some careful appraisal of
the position of editor-in-chief and the effectiveness of this
newspaper. We eagerly await his efforts to succeed in areas ot
this newspaper's operation which need improvement.

To be editor of a six page weekly paper was a challenge for
us—and a joy. Few students have the fortune to realize the
absurd excitement in watching three metal forms fill up with
type, or in eating a ham and cheese a la Co-op for breakfast at
300 in the afternoon. For us, this 70th year of The Ring-tum
Phi was creation and communication. We couldn't have done it

had we not loved every minute of it.

And we couldn't have done it without the help of a manag-
ing editor named Roger Munsick. He lived in the office this
vear. And he'll be back next year as John Robinson's managing
editor. Without his hard work and sheer personality, The
Ring-tum Phi would have been much less for us than it was.

So we turn over the editorship of this newspaper with great
confidence, heartfelt gratitude, and no small degree of sadness.

A Word On Things To Come

With the election of a new editor-in-chief of the Ring-tum
Phi should come an inkling of things to come, With your in-
dulgence I will give you that inkling of information.

The Ring-tum Phi is Washington and Lee University’s
newspaper. A trite statement? I think not. The Ring-tum Phi
should satisfy its role. The paper must not only answer ques-
tions as to what has happened, will happen or is happening, but
more importantly the paper must tell what should happen. In
other words the paper should and will take a position on per-
tinent issues.

As editor-in-chief 1 seek the advice and opinions of all the
members of the Washington and Lee community. I am open
to suggestions and recommendations, so if you have any, feel
free to discuss them with me. However, one word of admonish-
ment—lI will listen to advice but will not bend to the whims of
my advisors.

When I was considering the job of editor-in-chief, I asked
the editor in residence, at Wake Forest, Bill Meliwain (a
former editor of Newsday) what my job would be as editor.
He said “You ought to try telling the boys at W&L something
that will make their life in Lexington a little easier. That can
he accomplished by giving them information they need, enter
taining them or giving them your opinions. But remember you
are editor-in-chief for their benefit, not your own benefit.
lhat's important so I warn you again remember it.”

1 could not have said it better so 1 will not try.

Burton Analyzes Rubin, Rally

BY DOUG BURTON

“We're really strong and we're
really beautiful and we're going to
win. We're going to take over the
state of Vermont; we're going to
take over the state of New Mexico;
we're going to take over the state of
Colorado, and we're going to win all
the elections—that’s what’s going to
happen—we're going to win all the
elections because we've got all the
youth on our side.

“You think that many of the teen-
agers are still backing the conserva-
tives . .. ; well, it's mighty small.
You may think It’s large—but it is
mighty mighty small and they are
really on the defensive, and you can
see them standing together in the
back; they are going to defend rac-
ism and they are going to defend
the Pentagon, and they are going to
defend the war against the Vietna-
mese; in every society like ours
which is so Nazi, there is always
going to be some young people who
continue the values of Nazism!” So
said Jerry Rubin last Friday night at
WAL.

He was one of the Eight, the war
lord at Charlottesville last May.
Newsweek loved him; the networks
crowden him with St. Elmo’s fire.
lo many he had typified the violence
and hilarity of the sixties; to us he
had conjured up visions of all that
was rotten and exciting in America.

Even with that in mind it was not
unpredictable that when his twice
cancelled flight finally did touch
down that Jerry Rubin, the kid who
had wanted to play second base for
the Cincinnati Reds, had landed
smack into the Wasps’s nest.

For weeks it had been billed as
the Shenandoah Festival for Peace
and Justice. Its organizers, Jeff Gin-
gold and the Bakery Free Library
drew wpon a proven formula: heavy
rock bands and three New Left sup-
erstars: Leonard Weinglass, Jerry
Rubin and Dave Dellinger. The
strategy called for Wilson Field to
be a brief staging ground for
throngs of demonstrators en route
to D.C. from points west and south.
Had it succeeded the Bakery would
have bested the celebrated Contact
program for a mere $500.00.

But things were wrong; Dellinger
cancelled suddenly and without ex-
planation; Weinglass couldn't leave
a court case in Pennsylvania. These
setbacks were followed by Rubin's
mismanaged plane reservations
which delayed his appearance until
12:30 a.m.

By that time the initial crowd of
perhaps 1000 had dwindled to 350.
This face of itself was perhaps the
biggest surprise to the organizers
who had anticipated a bare mini-
mum of 2000 persons.

Ironically, many of those who left

2 ee % Geet

BY MARC SMALL

| have been receiving a fair
amount of feed-back over the past
several months from readers who
have commented that I am too con-
cerned with political philosophizing
and fail to offer a series of pragma-
tic programs. This article will be an
attempt to rectify this fault by pre
senting a few ideas for political ac
tion on the conservative side

REDUCED FEDERAL TAXA-
TION: instead of a federal revenue
sharing plan, it seems far more
sensible to merely out federal taxa
tion, and allow the stages to decide
individually whether or not they
want to increase their own taxation
to compensate. This would save a
tremendous amount of book-keep
ing as well as increasing the state
voice in fiscal affairs

PRAGMATISM IN FOREIGN
AFFAIRS: instead of attempting to
base our diplomacy upon some im
perfectly conceived moral base, it is
more practical to establish friendly
relations with all and any nations
no matter what their internal policies

who demonstrate a like good-will
towards this nation, We are not the
moral guardians of the universe, and
it is extremely conceited as well as
hypocritical of us to pass unwarrani
ed judgment on our fellow-nations

INCREASED FISCAL RESPON.-
SIBILITY: there is an extremely ur
gent need for immediate “restructur
ing” of our financial affairs. In place
of the free and friendly policies that
have seen federal money
private

sponsoring
supporting farmers
who raise nothing, and being wasted
by and large on a panoply of boon
doggies and cost over-runs

The inflation of the past decade is
Ww an extent the result of
cades of spendthrift wuste

armies,

four de
if We ate
to cape even more serious CoOrm

quences We must restore some mens

ure of control to the federal bude:

early did so to prepare for the long
trip to Washington the next day.

Many who stayed — townspeople
from Lexington, Buena Vista and
the surrounding area, Buckleyites,

Young Republicans, and Sigma Chi
et al—hardly contributed to the
revolutionary fervor.

This is not to say that “straights”
outnumbered “heads.” The move-
ment was there too; demonstrators
came from as far away as Florida
and New York.

At Jerry’s side stood the frizzy
haired, newly elected sheriff of Ber-
keley, Calif., Stewart Alpert. Sheriff
Alpert is—if possible—a shade gid-
dier than Rubin. He promised to fire
any Berkeley cop who couldn't tell
Yippies where to buy “dope.”

Rubin himself managed to de-
flower every American icon in sight.
A sampling of general targets in-
cluded the following:

 

SOLUTIONS:

“We don’t know what's going to
happen after the revolution. Right
now we have a great potentiality.
We'll decide afterwards what to do
with the potentiality. It's the whole
thing all over: you gotta know where
you're going before you go. I don’t
know what it’s going to be like. We
have to take our chances. But it is
going to be a lot like the spirit in
China, the spirit in North Viet Nam
and the spirit in Cuba.”

THE ARMY:

“I talked to a black soldier on the
plane who told me, “We're stoned all
the time; we don’t go out to the
front lines; we stay back and smoke
grass. Who wants to go out and
fight?” The US has lost her army to
dope and common sense . . . Since it
lost its army, it’s turning to bombs
and technology. The US has lost the
war in Viet Nam, but the US cannot

admit that it has lost a war to people
who don’t even speak English.”
CALLEY:

When Rubin left at 2:00 a.m. after
a tense, insult spattered question
period, the round of applause was
pathetically weak. Reactions to him
were varied although all had been
somewhat awed by his timing,
humor and vitality. No burned out

sentment lingered among many.” He
put on a good show for a “political
moron,” ran a typical comment.

Jerry left smiling.

Letters To The Editor...

lo the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

What Jerry Rubin had to say was
rather strong, but his goals are a
very beautiful thing; it’s just that he
impresses most people as somewhat
of a maniac.

His main problem is in the labels
he uses for things. For instance, he
uses the word “communism” quite a
bit. He ignores the extremely bad
connotations it carries in this coun-

the part of the citizenry. A vast mul

try. We must remember that he said
the Russians have done to commun-
ism what the Roman Catholic
church did to Ohristianity, i.¢., over-
institutionalized it and used it to their
own ends, meaning here the people
in control of each organization.

For instance, the infallibility of
the Pope is very much like the lack
of questioning of a “party” decision
in the USSR. The social body be-
comes one which follows orders
from above, and those giving the
orders are basically concerned with
selfish ends, mostly making them-
selves very materially seoure. An-
other victim of this philosophy is
Lt. Calley.

The true goals of communism are
actually what philosophers have
been writing about for thousands of
years; the popular term I would use
is Utopia. It is the sooiety in which
everyone thinks in just those terms

the society. Not themselves, It is
the same thing as the “greatest good
for he greatest number.”

I can only hope that when my
generation goes to the ballot box,
which is our most sensible and legal
recourse, that we will think in terms
of something larger than just over-
selves. For instance, don't vote
rgainst someone who favors a guar-
anteed annual income. The only
philosophy behind dislike of that
legislation can be one of “If I have
to work for mine, he should have to
work for his.” This is basically very
selfish

It is silly (and tragic) enough that
with this truly global village created
by the electronic media, in which
the entire earth is one community,
that we should divide ourselves into
nations, and the United States goes
even farther: we are divided into
S0 smaller entities which are basic-
ily useless and very ineffecient

Marxist idea of the withering away

there is no government, But if it is
done right—and we have to try

hen no government is necessary, be

cause everyone is thinking about

bout himself and how to manipu

To grasp this from Mr, Rubin's

many long hours of thinking in a

think, fo is basic tenet 6 thal your

For the convenience of those who
wouldn't reach the conclusions on
their own, Karl Marx wrote several
works, Don't think that I worship
him or anything, but he does have a
way of putting things into words
which is pretty good. Try reading
some of that filthy commie propo-
ganda that he wrote; he was preach-
ing Utopia as an end product.

Mr. Rabin wants everyone to
wake up to the possibility of such a
society for the human race and to
start working for it. He wants every-
one to go to Washington, D.C., on
‘May Day and stay there until it
happens. | wish we could all do that,
for what he has in mind as a result
would probably appeal to most peo-
ple as a suitable alternative to the
society we now have.

Unfortunately, doing this would
require “copping out” (excuse the
cliche) of the lives most of us are
now involved in, Personally, | feel
obligated to stay here in school be
cause my parents and the University
are paying for it—not me, Most of
us have instilled in us a set of goals
which run something like “Make
something of yourself,” which means
to get in the rat race and make a lot
of money.

This is the attitude which must be
overcome: everyone must be con
vinced that personal wealth is very
seHish as an end goal, and that if it
keeps going the way it is now, we
will destroy ourselves, either through
atomic warfare or pollution. If you
can understand the fact that the
world will go on without you-—«who
ever you are—~you can begin to real
ize just how unimportant you are to
this world.

Question. “What would be the
first thing you would do with the in-
field area of Washington and Lee’s
Smith Field?”

Answer. “Skin it and resod the
whole thing.”

Such was the exchange in. the
W&L dugout between one of last
Thursday’s umpires and a W&L
player. The venerated man in blue
went further to say that he would
apply the same process to the out-
field, stripping the playing areas of
their cow pastures and replacing it
with real grass.

One need only observe either or
both of the Generals’ two games last
week to watch some crazy bounces.
Of course, when you lose 11-7 ‘to
Hampden-Sydney and 15-6 to Vir-
ginia it certainly isn’t bad hops
you're getting, but last week made
for a couple of exciting dodge ball
matches.

The thing that made the contests
interesting, for a few innings at
least, was the fact that the other
team had to play on that same casta-
strophic surface, which meant that
when a General put wood on the
ball, chances were better than aver-
age that he would get on base.

For a while, W&L had the enemy
on the ropes. Take the
game as an example. The Wahoos
jumped off to a four run lead in the
first inning, sandwiching five hits and
a couple of errors. Not to be left
for dead, the Big Blue came back
with two runs of their own on Dave
lraylor’s second home run of the
season, which, incidentally, gaye him
half the team total. :

The carefree Cavalier bench de-

eriorated into a worried bunch when

the Generals continued the uprising
in the second inning by adding three
runs after holding the enemy score-
less.

What you should know about diamonds
when you know it's for keeps

 

You've dreamed about your
diamond engagement ring a thou-
sand times. But now that you
know it’s for keeps, it’s time to
stop dreaming and start learning
about diamonds and their value.

Because no two diamonds
are exactly alike, jewelers have
adopted exacting standards to de-
termine the relative value of each
and every diamond in the world.
These standards include a dia-
mond's size (carat weight), color,
cut and clar:

 

COLOR: Fine white diamonds are
quite rare and valued accordingly.
Other shades in relative order of

their worth are: blue,

brown and black.

CUT: The cut of a diamond—the
facets placed on it by a trained
cutter—brings out the gem's fire
and brilliance. Anything less than
correct cut reduces beauty, bril-
liance and value

CLARITY: Determined by the ab-
sence of small impurities. A per-
fect diamond has no impurities
when examined under ten power
magnification by a trained eye

CARAT: A _ diamond's size is
measured in carats, As a diamond
increases in size, its price will
increase even more if the quality
remains constant. But larger dia
monds of inferior quality may ac
tually be worth less than smaller,
perfect diamonds

white hats, so to speak. They are at
best a rather dark grey.

The first step is to accept the ab-
surdity of the war in Vietnam and to
get out. The time for noble inten-
tions, if they ever existed, is now
past. We are losing lives for no pur-
pose other than protecting our own
interests, mostly financial.

Since I, like most of us, feel too
tied down to school to go, to May
Day “for the duration,” I am going
to be content to write and hopefully
phone my congressman and sena-
tors. | hope you will, too. Six cents
and fifteen minutes isn’t too much to
ask of anyone, even a very busy col-
lege student.

Tell him what you think, whatever
it is; I'm sure it isn’t the same thing
I'll be telling mine, but after all, he’s
YOUR representative in this govern-
ment; he’s the man you send to Con-
gress to get the most out of it he
can for his own district, thus ‘hope-
fully assuring his re-election. I’m
telling my congressman to stop think-
ing about his re-election and grab-
bing everything he can for my
“home” district. I'm telling him to
start thinking about this whole coun-
try and this whole world, not just a
small part of it. | want him to realize
that political borders are useless to-
day.

We must learn to think about
what could be, not just what is and
how to get the most out of it for
ourselves. And we've got to work for
it. If we don’t, then the chances of it
ever coming about are reduced from
one in millions to zero, As the saying
goes, | wouldn't bet money on it,
either way. But we have to try or
die.

When the panic button goes off or
the clouds never go away and the
sun can't get through any more,
we're all going to die together: hip-
pies, pigs, commies, gooks, ginks,
and of course, “the silent majority.”
If you can’t think of it in any other
terms, think about yourself dying,
along with the of course relatively
insignificant billions of other people
on this planet.

Death is very permanent. Well,
that’s where this country and this

world are headed much too quickly.
As a matter of fact, our government
and the USSR’s both are so mili-
tarily efficient that we can kill each
other off 30 times! What Rubin was
saying was that we can be just as ef-
ficient in education, in farming, in
everything with LIFE rather than
killing as an end,

That's what this whole “revolu-
tionary” movement is about: stop
technology’s movement toward de-
struction and turn it toward the good
of all mankind. We must if we are to
survive,

And get this: when we win—and
we will, sooner or later—you won't
ever have to worry about “the com-
petition.” There won't be any. Every
one of us will be tops in our own
field, because we are all different and
will all have but one thing in com-
mon: realizing that we are all one
big community and working to make
it as good as possible for every one
of us. Heaven after all, is only what

we make of earth. It just takes work.

was granted with the stipulation that
the effort be successful and the in-

McCall also presented a plan call-
ing for a $20 subsidy per student be
added to the Student Activities Fund
to finance the Dance Board concerts.
He suggested the remainder of the
money could be raised by tickets for
dates at the door.

Tompkins and Thompson concurr-
ed that this idea was totally infeas-
ible. that Dance Board funds simply
could not be extracted on a manda-
tory basis. Skip Nottberg, this year’s
Dance Board chairman, said that he
thought it just as well that the Dance
Board be made to raise its own
funds. “We will probably work a
littlhe harder and the Dance Board
President will probably fell himself
more accountable to the students, if
‘we retain the system of selling dance
plans.”
