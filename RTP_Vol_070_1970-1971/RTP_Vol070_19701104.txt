THE RING-TUM PHI

Washington and Lee University’s Weekly Newspaper

On Rush

BY ROY CARLTON

(Editor’s Note: This edition marks
the beginning of a weekly feature
“PinPoint,” which will appear in this
column of The Ring-tum Phi’s front
page. “PinPoint” is a column of news
analysis and commentary upon any
recent event of significance to the

Phi.)

To no one’s surprise the debut of
Washington and Lee’s extended rush
period has proven to be a failure.
The full consequences of the venture
and the degree of its impotence will
only be known later in the year as
the number of fraternity deactiva-
tions mount, but in the meantime
some limited conclusions may be
drawn.

Last year some 75% of the fresh-
man class pledged fraternities during
one of the smallest rushes in me-
mory.

This year 58% of the freshman
class pledged. Besides being the
worst rush in Washington and Lee
history, the inequities in the size of
the pledge classes ranged uniformly
from two to twenty-four.

Compounding the difficulties of
the fraternities is the rash of deacti-
vations since early jast year. In an
article which I researched for The
Tuesday Ring-tum Phi of Nov. 11,
1969 it was shown that rising deacti-
vations had contributed to a mem-
bership dilemma for the fraternities.
Conspicuously, only one fraternity
had been successful in keeping its
members in the fold, Kappa Alpha.
At the time the article went to press
they had only one deactivate. Seven
months later a mass exodus from
the membership rolls had forced the
chapter to fold.

Such difficulties had not bees
confined to Kappa Alpha only. 1969-
70 also saw Kappa Sigma fold and
numerous other houses were rumor-
ed to be voting on the possibility.

Obviously the only solution to the
fraternities’ difficulties could come
from a good rush. Holding the
pledges within the ranks would be
a difficulty to be contended with
later,

Fifty-eight percent was below the
most pessimistic predictions. To be
sure, the houses had more than the
customary share of problems with 1
new rush system. Rushing techniques
had to be adjusted. A good image
had to be sustained for a longer per-
iod of time. Limited contacts had to
be cultivated to their utmost and
dirty rushing would become a way of
life. Nevertheless, with the record
of depledgings and deactivations his-
tory had given us, 58% is not enough
to sustain sixteen fraternities.

There is substantial grounds for
laying the blame on the IFC. Not io
indulge in the traditional game of
IFC baiting, it must be said thal
the Council made the best of a bad
situation. However, in the past with
a one-week rush it was easy to bully
the freshman class into pledging
early. The naive freshman saw his
friends pledging and was threatened
by social ostracism. Now, with two
months to survey his situation, many
of freshman has apparently decide:
to trust in himself

The IFC sought (following rush)
to discover if the new rush period
was too long. The effort was belai-
ed and will be ineffectual. Making
a personal estimate of the situation,
| would not be at all surprised [
the number of fraternity men left on
campus is considerably less than
S0% as opposed to 754 when |
first came to this campus. The weak-
er houses will fold this year. A new
rush system will not help them 4
though it may save one or two from
folding next year

Troub’s First Fare

Premieres

BY CAL WHITEHURST

The Troubadour Theatre opens its
1970-71 season tonight at 8:30 with
“Billy Budd,” an adaptation of the
Herman Melville novel.

The play, written by Louis O.
Coxe and Robert Chapman, is set
aboard a British ship-of-the-line in
the year 1798, a time when the Eng
lish navy was confronted with war
against France and mutinies among
its Own crews.

Brooks Atkinson, who reviewed
the Coxe-Chapman production for
the “New York Times,” gives an ac-
curate summary of the play’s mean-
ing. “Absolute good and absolute
evil cannot live in this world togeth-
er, according to Melville,” Atkinson
wrote, “each must destroy the other,
for human life is a compromise that
follows the middle way.”

In the play. Billy Budd, a hand-
some sailor, is an innocent who can-
not comprehend that there is evil in
the world. John Claggart, the ship's
master-at-arms, is the personifica
tion of that evil. Resenting Billy's
complete trust and lack of fear, Clag-
gart accuses Billy of being the ring-

cause the boy's execution.

Billy, speechless with fury at Clag-
gart’s treachery, strikes out blindly
and kills him. The denouncement is
swift. Law supercedes justice and
Billy is hanged for his crime.

Troubadour director Ellen Barnes
has added a closing scene which was
not included in the Coxe-Chapmaa
original. After Billy is hanged, the
ship's officers exit and the crew re-
sumes their normal activities. With
this additional scene, Mrs. Barnes
makets a point distinctly lacking in
the original text of the play: that is,
the conflict between good and evil
really has very little effect on the
basic monotony of life.

“Billy Budd” will be presented
each night through Saturday at 8:30.

Two individuals closely associ-
ated with Washington and Lee
won statewide offices in Tennes-
see last election night.

William E. Brock HI, a mem-
ber of the Class of 1953 defeated
incumbent Senator Albert Gore,
who was seeking to win election
to a fourth term in Washington.
Last spring, Brock had defeated
Tex Ritter, the country singing
star, in the Republican primary.

Brock, Republican Congress-
man for the past six years, was
backed strongly by Nixon admini-
stration support, including per
sonal visits in Tennessee by the
President and Vice-President Ag-
new. Brock was one of several
Republican congressmen who
passed up virtually certain re-elec-
tion to attempt to defeat incum-
bent Democratic Senators.

The Roanoke Times this morn-
ing credited Brock with 52% of
the vote with 88% of the ballots
counted.

Brock, 40, was a member of

 

Brock, Dunn Win Races

the Banking and Currency com-
mittee in Congress, and also serv-
ed on a special Congressional
committee that investigated camp-
us unrest last year.

In 1964, Brock served as Pa-
rade Marshal for the 1964 Mock
Republican Convention at Wash-
ington and Lee.

Winfield Dunn, the father of
Chuck Dunn of Memphis, Wash-
ington and Lee sophomore, won
the Tennessee gubernatorial race
for the Republicans. He is the
first GOP governor of the Volun-
teer State in half a century.

Dunn defeated his Democratic
opponent by a margin roughly
comparable to that of Brock. He
earns the position now held by
Buford Ellington, a Democratic
governor who did not seek re-
election.

Dunn, a dentist by profession,
had long been prominent in party
politics and has been credited in
large part with building up the
GOP organization in populous
Shelby County which includes
Memphis.

Page 2 THE RING.TUM PHI

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
November 4, 1970

In Case You Haven’t Noticed...

If anyone in our readership on campus has reached these
columns and still finds himself without any evening activities
for the next few days, he has obviously missed the front page
of this newspaper entirely.

At the hours of 4:00 and 8:00 tomorrow evening, students
will have the opportunity to exchange ideas with Dr. Henry
Steele Commager, a historian widely known for his commen-
tary on the present state of higher education. His visit will in-
augurate Contact’s symposium this year, “The Crisis in Educa-
tion ;” and we can think of no more timely a topic for ardent
discussion and careful thought. Dr. Commager has expressed a
desire to be in constant discussion with students throughout
his brief stay ; we trust the students will reciprocate that desire.

Contact is not the only annual event on campus making its
yearly debut this week. 8:30 tonight will mark the beginning of
the 1970-71 Troubadour Theatre season with Coxe and Chap-
man’s “Billy Budd’ (or perhaps we should call it Coxe and
Chapman and Barnes’ “Billy Budd,” for we've got it that Mrs.
Ellen Barnes has wrought quite a dramatic creation out of an
extremely difficult script). We advise our readers to forget
about seeing tonight's performance—the theatre will be filled.
Perhaps the best time to see the show will be the Saturday
afternoon performance which was added to the schedule yes-
terday because of the flurry of reservations made early in the
week, “Billy Budd” promises to be a worthwhile experience ;
make the effort.

October 22’s Homeroom Election

Mr. Alan Prater’s letter to the editor which appears on page
three of this edition is extremely disturbing. One cannot read-
ily imagine active campaigning about the ballot boxes on
campus; yet the thought of a member of the Executive Com-
mittee doing some suggestive campaigning of his own taxes
the imagination beyond endurance.

Yet we are somewhat comforted by the fact that by resort-
ing to tactics of this sort, the persons involved have made these
elections a shade less significant than an eighth grade home-
room election. At least a homeroom election is monitored by
teachers who have no interest whatsoever in the outcome.

A Prologue For Dr. Commager

We thought it might be of interest to our readers if we pre-
sented a small prologue to Dr. Commager'’s visit to Washing-
ton and Lee tomorrow by penning a few comments of our own
on “The Crisis In Education.” Upon perusal of the editorial
columns of The Wall Street Journal’s October 26, 1970 edi-
tion, however, we found to no surprise that that newspaper's
editors had surpassed our capacity for eloquence. Therefore
we present the following excerpts from “Official Truth, Camp-
us Version” as a keynote to Dr. Commager’s visit.

“One of the more interesting aspects of the campus scene
is the arrogance of the militant students—and of quite a few
faculty members as well. They talk and act as though they were
the sole recipients of Revealed Truth.

“This whole phenomenon is well described in a New York
Times Magazine article by John P. Roche, a Brandeis Univer-
sity professor and a man of high liberal credentials.

“It is nothing new for a university to be pressured by out-
siders who want it to proclaim their particular version of
Truth. But today the pressure is coming from students and
faculty within the university. They demand that it officially de-
clare itself on various issues.

“Thus after Cambodia and Kent State last spring, many
faculties voted resolutions announcing such things as “fer-
vent opposition” to the U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia
and “solidarity with our students” against political repression
in America and applied war research at universities. Writes
Mr. Roche:

“*As far as Brandeis and probably 300 institutions of higher
learning in the United States (who went through the same
drill) are concerned, it is Officially True that the United States
is ‘repressive,’ that the Indochina war is an immoral, imperialist
foray and that war-related research is wicked, (Mr. Roche
happens to believe that the U.S. is one of the least repressive
societies in history, that the war in Indochina is not immoral
and imperialist, and that war-related research is not necessarily
wicked.)

“An unhappy corollary of this intolerant conformism is its
implication that the professors should teach the students the
conformist view of truth. Professor Roche finds that approach
indefensible, and so do we.

“In this and other ways the idea of Community Truth vio-
lates academic freedom itself and drastically distorts the con-
cept of a university, As Mr. Roche says: “The best definition
of a good education | have ever encountered was that it in-
volves growing up in an atmosphere of intellectual conflict,

The Mystery Of
Law and Order
In “Billy Budd”

BY STEVE HAUGHNEY

During the political campaign
just concluded, the phrase “law and
order” was bandied about so many
times and by so many candidates of
different political perspectives that
any reasonable force it may have
once conveyed was lost and gave way
to a purely emotive force.

The vexing questions about the
relationships of law and of justice,
of authority and of individual rights
were passed over by candidates
seeking to exploit their (public's
hopes and fears and to suppress any
reasonable examination of these
problems, But long after the cam-
paign rhetoric has subsided, the prob-
lems remain, the questions still large-
ly unasked.

“Billy Budd,” the Trowbadour
Theater production opening tonight
and running through Saturday, raises
these questions, and it does so with
an insistent and dramatic power that
is the play’s most remarkable fea-
ture. The script, written by Louis
Coxe and Robert Chapman, is an
adaptation of the well-known Mel-
ville novella which depicts the story
of Budd, a paradigm of extreme in-
nocence and goodness, as he is
brought into conflict with law and
authority. It is a morality play, in
essence, a play which, although ele-
mental, defies simplification.

This is Ellen Barnes's first produc-
tion as acting director for the
Troubs, and judging from the re-
hearsal I saw Monday night, it pro-
mises to be an interesting season.
She has added a dramatic frame to
the play, with the sailors perform-
ing mundane chores and engaging in
petty amusements at the beginning
and at the end, in an attempt to place
this extraordinary action in an every-
day context.

The conflict ‘between extreme

Billy Budd: a paradigm of extreme innocence and goodness is brought into conflict with law and authority, The
play begins tonight at the Troubadour Theatre. Budd is played by sophomore Scott Reiger.

and extreme evil, in the person of
Claggart the Master-at-arms, is re-
solved by the law so that its effect
on ‘normal’ life is minimal; the ac-
tion of the play is contained within
this overriding irony.

In interpreting characters Mrs.
Barnes and her actors run a great
risk, for the play very readily con-
verts to melodrama of the worst sort
if the dramatis personae are not por-
trayed with subtlety and precision;
yet this danger has been skillfully
avoided, and the leading characters
are presented as complex men strug-
gling with complex moral problems.
Claggart, as freshman Doug Huttoa
in his first Troub production por-
trays him, is a man dominated by
spite and fear whose hatred for
Budd is matched only by his facina-
tion with him.

 

The sailors perform mundane chores and engage in petty amusements
to place the extraordinary action in everyday context.

The character of Budd presents
the greatest challenge, from the ac-
tor’s standpoint, in the play, for he is
the least believable and the closest
to an abstraction; yet Scott Reiger
humanizes him and makes him the
commanding figure of the drama.
Captain Vere, played by O. K.
Barnes, is at once impassioned and
philosophic.

Bob Carrere and Cal Whitehurst,
as the ship's two young officers, are
very good, as is David Christovich
as Jenkins. Of special note are Steve
Lester, playing Dansker, the old
man whose terse comments provide
much of the intellectual power of
the play, and Walkie May, whose
portrait of Squeak almost steals the
show. The actors and the directress
do an admirable job with a play
that is difficult to present.

Once again O. K. Barnes has de-
signed a great set, and one well in-
tegrated with the action of the play.
This set, with its long deck extend-
ing back through the proscenium
arch, seems to draw the audience
into the drama, while the rigging
presents an illusion of height per-
fectly suited to the action. It is with-
in this setting that the conflict be-
tween ‘natural’ goodness and all-too-
human law takes place, a conflict
whose outcome is made more ter-
rible by the fact that it is inevitable
because it is the human reality.

After all the political rhetoric we
have been subject to these past few
months, it is refreshing (and frigh:-
ening) to see the meaning of “law
and order” presented dramatically
in all its mystery.

Canine Friends, WLUR--
Two Noteworthy Features

Dogs to Aid Police Force

Criminals in Lexington are now
faced with a distinctly non-human
adversary on the City Police Force:
two German Shepherds which have
been undergoing professional train-
ing for two months.

The two canine rookies, King and
Roark, are now padding a beat with
night officers as they make their
rounds of checking places of busi-
ness. They are owned by Lt. R. L.
VanDerVeer and Patrolman Jack C.
Purvis, and are being trained under
the supervision of Bob Whiteside, a
professional trainer from Roanoke
who has trained dogs throughout the
state. Although the officers person-
ally own the dogs, the police depart-
ment finances the training and the
food for them.

Well-trained in obedience, the dogs
can assist the officers in crowd coa-
trol, tracking lost or injured persons,

Student Taxes, But No Votes

BY DOUG BURTON

Professor Ritz in a letter to the
Lexington News-Gazette (Oct. 14)
argued that “a person subjected to
the burdens of residency, such as
the payment of taxes, is also entitl-
ed to the benefits of such residency,
such as the right to vote.” City Man-
ager Guy Agnor told The Ring-tum
Phi last Tuesday that payment of
local taxes such as the motor ve-
hicle tax does in no way entitle stu-
dents to vote in local elections,

“The automobile license tax is a
usage fee,” Agnor said, “for the ex-
pense of providing public parking,
street maintenance, snow removal,
traffic signs, cic.”

In reply to charges that the li-
encse revenue had not been stipu-
lated for street maintenance, he ex-
plained that “street maintenance is
financed by a general fund, and ap-
propriations for street maintenance
are directly related to the amount of
tax revenue from motor vehicle |i-
censes Revenue from the state
highway maintenance funds gives
$70,930 to the city of Lexington
Local licence revenue is estimated to
be $29,000, The sum of these figures
is the amount budgeted by the city
for street maintenance,” Agnor said,
“which isn't enough as you can see
by the nunmvber of chugholes in the
streets.”

The city manager noted that the
city is also empowered to collect a
personal property tax from students,
although this does not entitle stu
dents to voting privileges

This is disconcerning news to
reiny studenis, who, under present

Virginia law must be 21 years of age
and residents for one year before
they can vote in Virginia, although
they do not have to wait 15 minutes
to puy city taxes in Lexington.

As Dr. Ritz has pointed out, the
present one-year requirement has
already been declared unconstitu-
tional by one one federal judge and
is now before a three judge federal
court. A revision in the proposed
new Virginia Constitution would re-
duce the residency requirement for
voling to six months,

This act coupled with the enact
ment last spring by Congress of
legislation under which the states
will be required after January 1,
1971 to permit all persons 18 years
of age and older to vote in all elec-
tions might convert the student
bodies of WAL and VMI into 2500
eligible voters in Rockbridge county

In answer to Dr. Ritz, William
Dunlap, chairman, Rockbridge
County Electoral Board, in his own
letter to the News-Gazette (Oct, 28)
quoted from Section 24 of the Vir
ginia Constitution: “No officer, sol
dier, seamen, or marine of the Unit
ed States army or navy shall be
deemed to have gained a residence as
to the right of sufferage, in the state,
of in any county, cily or town there
of by reason of being stationed
therein; nor shall an inmate of any
charitable institution or a student in
any institution of learning, be re
garded as having cither gained oF
lost a residence, as to the right of
suffrage, by reason of his location
OF sojourn in sich institutions

Dunlap also stuled: “The right to

vote is spelled out in the Constitu-
tion of Virginia and is not granted
to a person by any local governing
body. The payment of taxes does not
qualify a person to vote,”

Agnor also told The Ring-tum Phi
that should a student decide to de-
clare Lexington his residence, he
would be asked to make a declara-
tion of his personal property and
would be sent a state income tax
form.

WLUR Covers Elections

Beginning last night at 7:00 p.m.,
WLUR-FM presented complete elec-
tion coverage which continued until
the last returns were in. The several
phases of the election were covered
differently, with the Associated Press
Wire Service supplying informa-
tion on national and statewide races,
and student reporters calling in to
report local results.

Operating with a forty man staff,
WLUR was able to place over eigh-
teen reporters in the field. Polling
places in Lexington and Buena Vista
were covered, as were the headquar-
ters of candidates in Richmond, Roa-
noke, Winchester, and Charlottes-
ville.

Reporters who had familiarized
themselves with a particular candi-
date or a particular race acted as
commentators, discussing various
aspects of the election and possible
voting trends.

Letters
To the Editor

On Freshman Elections
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Many people have been com-
(plaining about our system of  stu-
dent government here at W&L. They
claim it does not allow for adequate
class representation ‘because of the
small number of persons chosen to
“do the representing’. This ano-
maly is compounded when one fra-
ternity is able to strong-arm the elec-
tion of representatives,

The freshman class elections of
two weeks ago produced some rath-
er surprising results—but perhaps
not so surprising when one takes a
cnitical eye to the voting procedure.

It has always been the procedure
of the Executive Committee to use
ballot boxes and hand-counting in-
stead of more sophisticated machin-
ery. I don’t necessarily argue with
this. However, this necessitates a
close watch on the ballot box—pre-
sumably by members of the Execu-
tive Committee.

How did three people manage to
stage unbelievable runaways in the
runoffs? Well, I suppose much can
be attributed to their particular
abilities—but then, these abilities
did not manifest themselves to such
a peculiar degree in the primary
election. I have been approached
by several members of the freshman
class who noticed that the E.C. were
not the only persons watching the
polls during the runoffs.

Being a pledge in a large, power
ful, politically connected fraternity
is certainly an asset, especially if
your frat brothers mill around the
polling boxes and do some last-min-
ute campaigning. This is what has
been reported ot me by several fresh-

men: members of Pi Kappa Alpha
were pushing for their freshmen
candidates around the boxes. Very
close around the boxes.

This is, to begin with, unethical.
As a matter of fact, one freshman,
whose name I have withheld by re-
quest, was in the process of making
out his ballot when Craig Jones, who
was manning that particular box,
asked, “Are you sure that’s what
you want to do?” At the time, the
freshman was not voting for the
PiKA candidate for E.C. Now,
please bear in mind that, in this, 1
am merely relating what was repor'-
ed to me. The freshman (promptly
told Jones to go to hell.

Right on.

Barksdale’s Thanks

To the editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

‘May I use the columns of your
newspaper to comment about some-
thing that has nothing to do with
Vietnam, environmental pollution,
inflation, drugs, or any of the other
critical problems that are much on
our minds, but that has very much
to do with the quality and humanity
of our lives. I refer to the concert of
October 27 by I Solisti di Zagreb
when for two enjoyable hours the
generation and culture gap seemed
to narrow appreciably as old and
young alike found again that great
music performed ‘by distinguished
artists can heal our differences, ele-
vate our spirits, and simply bring
pleasure.

To those of us who have worked
to make possible twenty-five years of
fine music and theater under au-
spices of the Rockbridge Concert
Theater Series, it was especially gra-
tifying to see the largest audience at
last week’s concert that we have had
for some time, and to note how
warmly responsive it was. It was es-
pecially pleasing to see a large turn-
out of students. The Series has more

year than it has had in several. This
s encouraging and most gratifying,
despite a drop in membership at
Southern Seminary and VMI.

Those who have worked to make
the Series possible include a lot of
people, and thanks are due to the
ladies who labored at the eternally
difficult task of selling subscriptions,
to the Lexington News-Gazette and
radio stations WREL and WLUR-
FM for generous and helpful pub-
licity, to Mayor D. E. Brady for his
proclamation recognizing the Series’
25th anniversary, and to the two
Lexington colleges and many indivi-
duals and business firms who through
sustaining memberships have pro-
vided jiberal financial support. But
most of all, thanks are due to the
members of the Series themselves—
from grade schoolers attending their
first concert to some who have rare-
ly missed a concert in the past 25
years—for there is not much the
Board cannot do if we have enough
members and very little it can do if
we don’t have members.

And just in case there is some-
body reading this who may not have
been present at the opening concert
to get his ration of spiritual nourish-
ment, let me remind him that it isn’t

too late to join up and still hear

three more splendid attractions. Yet
to visit Lexington in this Silver An-
niversary season are exciting Korean
tenor Philip Cho, the Preservation
Hall Jazz Band from New Orleans,
and the distinguished New York Pro
Musica. I am willing to guarantee
that anybody who hears these three
remaining concerts will be a better
person for having done so, besides
which he will have had a lot of
genuine pleasure.

Arnold Questions Paper
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:
At a time when there is so much
going on at Washington and Lee and
the surrounding community, so many

Page 3

issues concerning us as students that
are here now present before us and
were here when we arrived, it strikes
me that The Ring-tum Phi has done
little, save in extra-ordinary cir-
cumstances, to confront and report
these issues, It strikes me as a piti-
able failure in journalism and in
maintaining the role of a school
newspaper.

I have two recommendations: (a)
that you involve yourselves not so
much with the great issues which

ynfront this University (although
they too should be examined in their
(proper context), ‘but with the minor,
irritating issues which confront too
many of the student body each day,
May I suggest issues such as Fresh-
man/Sophomore P.E. — whether it
is valid, necessary, and worth the
inconvenience. Issues such as athle-
tic scholarships—whether we need
them, want them, or even, in fact,
can have them. Whether the coach-
ling staff at Washington and Lee is
proviidng the leadership necessary
for active participation in intercol-
legiate athletics. Whether the ad-
ministration has done everything it
can to do aid athletics, or athletic
participation.

And (b) may I suggest that you
cease to be so interested in that side
of the issue which is “right”, or
I am afraid that this is merely a
“good” (you must forgive me here,
value judgment of mine) and that in-
stead you concern yourselves more
with merely presenting issues which
need to be aired, and not necessarily
adjudicated.

This is not meant to ‘be a lambasi-
ing, and I trust that you will not in-
terpret it as such. I am not interest-
ed in carrying crosses. I do think,
however, that the Ring-tum Phi
might ‘be much more interesting if
it were to tread on a few toes which
at least in my Opinion have gone too
long untreaded, and raise some is-
sues which have for too long gone
unquestioned. Thank you very much.

Ruggers Dominate U.Va.

In a superb effort, the W&L Rug-
by Club assured itself of a winning
season ‘by outclassing the University
of Virginia’s A & B team 23-3 Sat-
urday afternoon. Before a_ large

crowd of parents, wives and dates,
the W&L ruggers demonstrated their
offensive power by scoring twice in
the first ten minutes to make the
score 10-0,

Gregory and Hal St.

Clair.

The half ended with W&L leading
by 15-0 after Tom Baker took a
nice pass from St. Clair and sprinted
into the end zone from ten yards
out.

The second half was more of the
same, as the ruggers continued to
dominate play on a muddy field.

the game began to take on aspecis of

a rout when Ken Evans scored to
make it 20-0.

A few moments later, the Cava-
liers finally tallied to narrow the
margin to 20-3. Washington and Lee
made it’s final score when David
Guthrie took a pass from Larry Co-
hen and ran twenty yards into the
end zone to end the game 23-3.

Fred Fletcher continued his fine
kicking by making four out of five
conversions for a total of eight
points. First year players Charley
Brown and Chris Murray have
shown improvement with each game
and deserve special praise for their
alert play against Virginia.

With this great win over U.Va.,
the Rugby Club’s record now stands
at 4-1. After an initial loss to Vir-
ginia Tech, the ruggers have won
four in a row, the closest contest be-
ing a 10-8 win over Lynchburg two
weeks ago. In that game, it took
scores by Tom Baker and John Grif-
fith in the last five minutes to salvage
a victory.

This weekend the Club travels to
North Carolina and the final game
of the fall season will be the follow-
ing weekend against VMI.

 

Hats are off this week to the foot-
ball team and the coaching staff for
last Saturday's spectacular 13-0 upset
of Sewanee. The offense and the de-
fense finally seemed to jell, putting
together a team effort heretofore
unseen this year.

Up until last week, many were
muttering that the Generals might
wind up with but one victory, their
35-34 edging of Tufts. W&L had
managed to get drubbed just about
every time the football team step-
ped on the field: Emory and Henry,
Towson State, Centre, Hampden-
Sydney, and Western Maryland had
all enjoyed comfortable victories.
But all that was last week.

Offensively, the Generals came
back again and again, plugging for
yardage behind the running of Doug
Grossmann and JoJo Martin and

the arm of quarterback Steve Flu-
harty. Flu connected sixteen times in
thirty four tries for 198 yards, zing-
ing TD tosses of eleven and three
yards to flanker Bruce Green.

The receptions more than made
up for the Green's fluke fumble on
the two in which the ball rolled into
and cut of the end zone for a touch
back, giving the possession on thei:
twenty yard line.

The offensive line deserves a lot of
credit for prying holes into the Se-
wanee line for W&L’s ground game
and for providing Fluharty with pass
protection. Flu spent this game look-
ing downfield to his receivers rather
than on his back looking at the sky.

The defense performed brilliantly,
perhaps remembering the crucifixion
that W&L received last year in the
Tigers’ den, 37-21. That sixteen
point spread, the coals of which
smouldered until last Saturday, had
incensed Defensive Coach Boyd
Williams. The Generals’ keen de-
fense immobilized Sewanee's vaunt-
ed single-wing running game, caus-
ing the Tigers to change their game
plan and go to the airways.

WE&L's alert secondary put the
clamps to Tiger quarterback Gary
Sims’ efforts, practically taping
themselves to enemy receivers. Dave
Brooks, teaming with Jimmie Allen
and Marshall Washburn, played pro-
bably his best game of the year.
Sewanee's only puncture of this ae-
rial defense, a seemingly freak touch-
down reception which bounced out
of a defender’s hands, was nuilified
by an illegal procedure penalty
against the Tigers.

The important thing to remem-
ber, however, is that the Generals
rallied for this key game. Sewanee,
coming into the contest as an eigh-
teen point favorite, had defeated
conference pacesetier Cenire, 21-17,
ind was trying for the CAC cham
p.onship. With Saturday's viciory

Generals not only closed tic
door on the Tigers’ chances, but also
improved their own.

The General's now I-I in confer-
ence, can take at least a part of the
CAC crown by winning their last two
games with conference opponeriis
Southwestern and Washington.

1 don't know about anyone else,
but I'll take a little bell for foot-
ball anytime, 4-5 record or not.

Generals Turn Tables On Tigers,

BY PETER JONES
In spite of the old football adage,
“you can’t throw the ball in muddy
conditions,” Steve Fluharty complet-
ed 15 passes, two to Bruce Green
for touchdowns, en route to a 13-0
waxing of favored Sewanee before a

rain-dwindled Parents’ Weekend
crowd.

The defense definitely deserves tre-
mendous praise for their best per-
formance thus far this season. It’s
difficult to single out the most out-

standing though Frank Evans, Dave

Brooks, George Harris, and Scott
Neese combined for a large part of
the success that held the strong Se-
wanee ground game to only 27
yards rushing.

. then catches another between two Sewanee defenders setting up W&L’s

wing that just about Says to the de-
fense “Watch out, we're coming right
this way,” failed to move. W&L’s
first possession proved fruitless also.
The first quarter ended with nothing
more than the two teams’ punters
warming up.

But in the second quarter, a Se-
wanee punt found its ‘way into the
arms of Dave Brooks, who galloped
52 yards to the Sewanee 21. After
three passing attempts had failed,
Fluharty hit Bruce Green with a
crucial fourth down toss to the three
yard line. On the following play, the
same combination connected for the
score that proved to be the margin
of victory. Doug Chase’s PAT was
good and the score stood, 7-0.

The remainder of the quarter saw
little offensive punch except a Se-
wanee bomb of 30 yards for a touch-
down that bounced off at least three
pairs of hands but a penalty nullified
the play.

rhe rain fell intermittently as the
third quarter opened with the Gen-
erals receiving. More punts ensued,
a total of 19 in the game, but there’s
one play of the quarter Bruce Green
will probably have nightmares about.
Fluharty hit him with a 30 yard pass
to the Sewanee 10, and as he turned
up the sidelines and into the end-
zone, a Sewanee defender jarred the
ball out of bounds; and to com-
pound the matter, the officials gave
it to Sewanee on the rule of last pos-
session.

The fourth quarter again saw very
little offensive progress but plenty
of defense. The Generals’ final score
was set up by Marshall Washburn as
he intercepted a Sewanee pass and
returned it to their 10 yard line. On
the following play, Green snared his
second T.D. aerial from Fluharty.
The PAT was wide and for the re-
maining 5 minutes, the Blue defense
thwarted all attempts of a Sewanee
comeback.

Through this past week's game,
Fluharty has completed 94 passes for
1,109 yards and 6 touchdowns, sta
tistics which rank him number 1
among the nation’s passers. Steve
Mahaffey’s five receptions gives him
51 for the year for 687 yards and 2
touchdowns, a third ranking among
the nation’s receivers,

(Continued from Page 1)
Cole, president of the Publications
Board and Contact chairman.

The number of parents in attend-
ance was limited, due probably in
large part to Friday’s heavy rain.
But the parents displayed a genuine
interest in “sounding out” the stu-
dent representatives on a number of
questions, ranging from immediate
university problems to general poli-
tical issues.

One mother launched the initial
question by asking about the pro-
gress and/or fate of the “seminar
plan,” known as the Free University,
which was initiated last May. Robin-
son replied that the plan had been
“worthwhile experience” but com-
plained that students were not able
to take full advantage of the semi-
nars because of required studies.

The second question from parents
was “what are student feelings on
coeducation?” Robinson came out
immediately against the idea, saying
that the conversion would be “an

unnecessary expense.” Cole agreed,
saying that the switch to coeducation
had not worked out at Sewanee, al-
though there seemed to be general
satisfaction with the changes at the
“little Ivies,”

Lawrence, though, expressed a
strong hope for eventual coeduca-
tion at W&L, stating, “the school
Operates as an assimilator for stu-
dents entering society.” He felt,
therefore, that there was a “need for
a greater interchange between the
sexes” within a educational context.

Then Tompkins requested the par-
ents’ views on the incidents at W&L
last May following the Cambodian
intervention. One parent said she
thought that “students and faculty
handled it admirably,” while carry-
ing on the educational routine for
which the school was contracted.

Another said she thought “it was
silly to put a vote to students on
whether or not to take exams.”

Lawrence reiterated the detailed
developments of the strike actions

Student Accounts

has special checking accounts for students

last May, and he emphasized the dis-
tinction between “closing” and “re-
directing” the university. He said of
those who voted for the referendum
—some wanted to lock the doors,
some wanted to go to the beach, the
most were in the middle.” Maybe
not all were truly concerned, he add-
ed, but “everyone was worried.”

Two gentlemen disagreed in their
view of the effect of the national stu-
dent peace efforts. The first parent
said that students had “tried to im-
press Congress by confronting the
university, and lost out both ways,’

The second parent suggested that
student activism had “served as a
catalyst in making the government
contemplate problems and actions
that may otherwise have been neg-
lected.”

Cole pointed out the lack of ten-
sion that had distinguished W&L’s
strike experience, probably due to

the trust between faculty and _ stu-
dents in a small college. The prob-
lem, he said, was that the president
of the university today is unable to
tend to student problems and simul-
taneously ‘be “dickering with parents
and legislatures for money.”

The panel agreed that the general
result of the May incidents at W&L
was to bring the university together.
“There are many straight conserva-
tive students who have refused to
listen to students with long hair, but
this has inyproved,” said Murray.

talk about bamboo cages. Vicious beatings.
Malnutrition. Humiliation.

But the North Vietnamese will tell us
nothing. And it’s this silence that makes our
appeal more urgent.

For the families at home, there is no
word on who’s alive. Who’s dead. Or even
who's being held. There is nothing. Except
the anguish of not knowing.

Maybe you can —— this. By writing
to the one man who can change it: The Presi-
dent of North Vietnam.

Ask him to release the names of prison-
ers, allow them to write to their families,
and let the Red Cross inspect the prisons to

1949 Geneva Convention which his country
signed. And by the Istanbul resolution.

North Vietnamese leaders do care about
American public opinion. And if they think
they can gain something by bowing to it,
they will.

But one letter won’t do it. Or a thousand.
Maybe it will take millions. So we've got to
write now. All of us. And often.

Write a letter tonight. And send it to:
Office of the President, Democratic Repub-
lic of Vietnam, Hanoi, North Vietnam.

—" cost you a quarter. But it might save
a life.
