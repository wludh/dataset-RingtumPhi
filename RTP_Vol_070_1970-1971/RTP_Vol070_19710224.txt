New Constitution Dumped By Light Turnout

‘It Was A Thought Out Of Its Time;
Of Course I’m Disappointed,’--Azuma

The new Student Body Constitu-
tion failed to get the needed votes
yesterday. At least 740 votes were
required for the proposed changes
to go into effect. Only 530 votes
were cast in favor of the amend-
ments to the 45 year old Constitu-
tion.

Just 43 per cent of the W&L stu-
dents cast a ballot at one of the five
polls. Of those casting their votes,
84 per cent favored the changes.

Contacted by telephone last night,
Student Body President Fran Law-
rence said, “simply not enough peo-
ple voted.”

“My interpretation is that it didn’t
generate sufficient student interest,”
Lawrence continued, “I don’t think
the students want a new constitu-
iton.”

When questioned as to why the re-
ferendum defeated the EC proposal,
Lawrence said, “We might have call-
ed the question to a vote too soon.”

Glenn Azuma, who was the chair-
man of the Constitutional Ohanges
Sub-committee, commented, “It was
a thought out of its time. Of course
I'm disappointed.”

“At least it wasn’t beaten by nega-
tive voting, but was beaten by a lack
of voting,” Azuma added. “I don't
think the lack of voter turnout is due
to a lack of publicity.”

Azuma was making reference to
the special edition of The Ring-tum
Phi, which printed much of the text
of the Constitution. Also the EC
mimeographed several copies of the
Constitution for distribution,

The basic changes in the new Con-
stitution dealt with revamping the
siudent government's structure. The
Executive Committee would be re-
placed by two bodies—an Honor
Council and a Student Senate. The
Honor Council was to have exclu-
sive jurisdiction over the Honor Sys-
tem. Administrative and legislative
functions of the student body would
be maintained under the auspices
of the Student Senate.

Changes in the ourrent Constitu-
tion have been considered by the
Executive Committee most of this
academic year. The proposed Con-
stitution, which fell short at the bal-
lot box, had travelled a long way.

Early this year the Executive Com-
mittee established a Constitutional
Changes Sub-committee to investi-
gate the posstbility of changes in the
Constitution. Glenn Azuma and Sta-
man Ogilvie headed this group. After
several meetings and an open forum,
Azuma explained, “It was felt that
more than amendments were needed.
We believed that an entire new Con-
stitution would be the best idea.”

Bh

The sub-committee drafted a pro-
posed scheme of student govern-
ment. This scheme involved the con-
cept of a Student Senate and Honor
Council,

After hearing the report of the
sub-committee, the Executive Com-
mittee decided to call a Constitu-
tional Convention to draft a new
Constitution. The EC called for peti-
tions from people interested in serv-
ing as delegates. These delegates
were required to present petitions
with 25 signatures.

The 32 delegates convened Febru-
ary 12 for a three day set of ses-
sions. The convention recommended
the creation of a Senate and Honor
Council to the EC. An entirely new
constitution was presented to the
EC for consideration.

February 15 the EC studied the
proposal of the convention. The
committeemen made minimal
changes in the wording and endorsed
the new constitution, At the same
meeting the committee established
yesterday as the voting date for a re-
ferendum.

According to the existing constitu-
tion, an EC endorsed change in the
constitution required a referendum
vote of one half of the student body.
The vote yesterday did not live up
to that requirement.

WA&L next month.

An Editorial

The Time Has Come, The Walrus Said...

... to talk of a couple of things. We find it
almost impossible to believe that with all the
coverage the Executive Committee, the Con-
stitutional Convention members and The
Ring-tum Phi have given to the proposed
changes in the Constitution, the students of
Washington and Lee have acted as if they
haven't even heard of a Constitution—much
less the proposed changes.

633 students turned out at the polls yester-
day. The Constitutional changes proposed by
the Executive Committee have been defeated
not because of any great surge of student in-
terest in preserving W&L’s traditional mode
of student government, not because the stu-
dents read the text of the proposal with open
minds and decided that the changes were not
in the best interest of the student body, but
because the students—or the majority of them
at any rate—just don’t care.

Because they don’t care enough to take
even a remote interest in their student gov-
ernment, we're happy that the proposals did
not pass. It would be devastating to have a
new student senate with only one candidate
to fill each office. In fact, what would happen
if there weren't enough candidates to fill the
positions ?

Anyone who thinks that anything dynamic
or valuable can be accomplished by The Stu-
dent Body of Washington and Lee Univer-
sity ought to be put in an institution for frus-
trated idealists.

But the light voter turnout yesterday is

only one more proof of the hackneyed state-
ment: W&L students are apathetic. Last
year as well as the year before, only one stu-
dent ran for the office of Vice President of the
student body. No one even applied for Fancy
Dress President last year. Dan Silberberg’s
having trouble finding people to work for the
Mock Convention last year. And The Ring-
tum Phi gets complaints each week about its
contents, but no one wants to put their work
where their mouth is.

The conclusion we've drawn from the vote
yesterday is not a new one. Students have
proved themselves to be as lethargic as the
American public: not until something like the
prospect of eliminating Saturday classes, or
closing down the University does the whole
of the student body put on the “concerned”
individual’s song and dance. Not because
they're interested in doing something for the
good of the University, The students are after
what's in it for them.

Whether the students know it or not, in
loco parentis is still here at W&L. The Exe-
cutive Committee. The Student Control Com-
mittee. The Curriculum Committee. The Fi-
nancial Relations Committee. The Dance
Board. The Publications Board. They've
been right here all along to serve you, watch
after you and tell you when you go wrong.
You don’t have to worry about a thing. We
may be fed up, frustrated, and tired of you
out there. But we'll be here, asking for your
help, and confident that we won't get it.

EC Discusses Independent Exams

In their Monday night mectng
the members of the Executive Com-
mittee made final plans for balloting
procedure in Tuesday's Constitution-
al referendum. They also formulated
a position, to be presented for fac-
ulty consideration, concerning the
continuation of the Independent
Exam system initiated last term.

lt was revealed that, in a survey
taken after the first trial of the less
restrictive exam schedule, some 200
of 250 students questioned confessed
to have heard some comment con
cerning the relative difficulty of a
cermin examination during the test
ing period. These “value judgments”

consisted usually of a camal expres-
sion or phrase, ¢.g., “The test was a
breeze” or “It was really hard.”

The E.C. was concerned that such
negligem comments, though not nec-
essarily intended as “cheating” and
not even necessarily helpful to an-
other student, comprised techn'cal
grounds for honor system prosecu-
tion. They ceded that such incidents
are extremely difficult to identify as
honor violations, but they feared
that continued student carelessness
would jeopardize the freedom of the
new independent exam procedure

Glenn Azuma pointed out that, to
be consistent with its previous posi-

REVIEW and OUTLOOK [Letters To The Editor...

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
February 24, 1971

Out Of The Educational Marketplace

This September the majority of students’ parents will be
writing a $1,100 check payable to Washington and Lee Uni-
versity—one-half of the total tuition for the next academic
year. Next year’s tuition fee of $2,000 isn’t scheduled to be the
peak in the steady rise of fees since 1960 from $750 to $2,000
this 1970-71 academic year.

After next year, the tentative prognostications of Univer-
sity Treasurer James Whitehead put the price tag of a W&L
education at $2,300 for 1973. But-W&L isn’t the only school
which finds it necessary to raise tuition costs annually; the
spiral in the price of a private education is common to private
institutions throughout the country. Inherent in this rising
cost of private education is the threat that the private institu-
tions will find themselves priced out of the education market.

Take the average middle class family. Seymour wants to

go to college—not that he’s sure why, but Mom and Dad did
the same thing so why shouldn't he? Mom and Dad know
the value of a college education for their Seymour, so they
shop around and decide that there are some good colleges in
the Virginia-North Carolina area. Finally it comes down to
the question of whether or not Seymour's Mom and Dad can
afford the cost of an education at W&L or at U.Va. Sey-
mour’s been accepted at both places. He doesn’t know what ex-
actly he wants to do so he'll try a little of everything his first
vear at school, whether it be in Lexington or Charlottesville.
' W&L can offer him one thing over other state schools:
close contact with his professors in a teaching-learning situa-
tion. But it’s 1972, money’s tight, Dad could afford it, but why
not go to the cheaper school?

This extremely simplified, facile story is attempting to point
out the alarming difficulties Washington and Lee will face in
the future due to tuition rises. In effect, the University is
pricing itself out of the pay-as-you-learn education plan upon
which it draws most of its students. In the next 10 years, W&L
could put itself out of the education market place altogether if
by 1980 the fee is $4,000 or $3,500, or even a little over $3,000.
Will the average parent of a student at W&L be willing to pay
that high a price for a W&L education when he could get the
same for his son at a state-supported institution—perhaps
ever the one that his state tax dollars support? We think not.

There is an alternative which has been presented by one
private institution which we think is an practical solution to
parental financing of a college education: let the student pay.
Yale University has instituted a plan whereby students can
defer the cost of their college years and pay in installments on a
percentage basis after their education at the college is com-
pleted.

The major benefit of the Yale plan, though, is that the de-
cision on the institution for a college education rests solely
with the student and not with his parents. With the student
footing the bill for his own education in his later life, a decision
about his educational future becomes more qualitative and less
quantitative as it is with the parent involved. Graduates from
Washington and Lee do not fare poorly in the world after
their yeats here; there is no reason for the University to su-
spect that in the following years they will not continue to
do so,

We encourage the trustees and the administration to ex-
amine the Yale plan closely with respect to the problems of ris-
ing costs at this University. By 1980 Washington and Lee could
be offering quality education which will be regarded as a lux-
ury by many parents of potential freshmen. And once the
educational process here becomes equatd solely with dollar
signs, W&L had better start looking for a modern-day George
Washington,

Look To Your Right, Mr. Yonge

\ppearing before the Executive Committee in its February
15 meeting, Mr. Jed Yonge claimed that The Ring-tum Phi
offered no opportunity for certain groups or individuals to ex-
press their opinions,

We are “incredibly biased and narrow-minded,” according
to Mr. Yonge. Therefore he feels the need to demand of the
EC that he be able to express his own view in the University
Center Newsletter,

We honestly wonder why Jed Yonge thinks he needs to go
to another newsletter to print his opinions for all to read, If
he wants to express his viewpoint, why can't he write a letter
to the editor of this newspaper? Judging from the content of
the four columns to the right of this one, we fail to see how
we've been “biased” or “narrow-minded,”

No wthe only reasoning we can ferret out of this whole mat
ter is that Mr. Yonge is saying that he believes our opinions to
be “biased” and “narrow-minded.” If that is in fact what he
means, we'd have to agree with him there: we don't hold two
opinions at once on anything we write about, Yes, in our edi
torial columns we are biased and we are “narrow-minded”
because we don’t attempt to support five different opinions
with five conflicting arguments

The Ring-tum Phi's existence would be quite dull indeed
if our readers agreed with us in everything that appeared in
these columns or elsewhere in the paper, There is nothing more
satisfying than to be able to stimulate the expression of diverse
opinions in thse pages. For if we were “biased” and “narrow
minded” in the publication of these pages each week, who
would read it? No one can learn anything from the experience
of talking to himself

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Let's get right down to the heart
of the matter. One of the main rea-
sons that many students are opposed
to ROTC on this campus is that it
is part of our military establish-
ment. This is a fact and ought to
be an issue.

I for one do not want any part
of that establishment on a campus
that I am attending. However the
opinion of one person usually does
not count for much. What people
want most of the time are facts.
Well, then, here are some facts
about our boys in the Pentagon:
(1) They have defoilated thousands
of acres of forests in Vietnam so
that the “enemy” could not hide
there. The final result was an almost
irreparable damage to the ecology
of the country that we are supposed
to be protecting. (2) They have
purposely dropped napalm on vil-
lages inhabited with civilians be-
cause there might have been Viet

BY MARC SMALL

I have seen many things change in
my two-and-one-half years at Wash-
ington and Lee: the declining mem-
bership in fraternities, the lessening
popularity of coat-and-tie, the met-
eoric life and death of the Progres-
sive Student Alliance in 1969, the
short existence of the Truck Stop
Liberation Movement and Stop, and
the morbidity of the weakening Stu-
dent Coalition. Of all the multitude
of events in my University existence,
the one sure and steady factor has
been the inability of any radical-lib-
eral group to remain in existence for
longer than five weeks.

On the other hand, the Conserva-
tive Society, Young Americans for
Freedom, and the University Repub-
licans have all maintained themselves
handsomely: the University Repub-
licans have never been below 20%
of the student body since 1965, and
have entrenched themselves as by
far the largest studem group.

This is not being written as either
a rejoicing or a lament, but rather as
an observation of the student Left's
repeated failure to organize and
maintain a structured form. The rea-
sons ate many and manifest—the re-
jection of organized pobitical parties,
the increased number of students liv-
ing in the county, the lotus-eater's
alternative of drugs. Yet, these do
not cover all students, and when I
asked a prominent Young Democrat
why they were never politically ac-

Cong there. (3) They have ordered,
or at least tolerated, massacres such
as My-Lai and have not put the
blame where it belongs (Gen. Koster
is still free). (4) They cannot give
an accurate figure on how much
money and equipment has been used
in Cambodia and openly admit that
they have no idea of what we have
used in Vietnam. (5) They supply aid
(unreported until recently) to coun-
tries like Spain and Greece. Ordi-
narily | don’t mind helping countries
defend themselves, but when I re-
call that both of these countries are
dictatorial and repressive, 1 wonder
what the generals use for morals.
That is not all: there have been
books written on the subject. But the
important thing to remember here
is that all the above is being done
WITHOUT the consent of Con-
gress.

If you think that this is an attack
on the military, you are right. But
it is more than just that. The

tive, | was told that “This is a Re-
publican canypus!”

To a degree this is true, and yet it
ibegs the question, for shouldn't such
a campus as this—sedate, compla-
cent, and conservative—be the ideal
‘breeding grounds for the Left?

Even where organized, the Left at
W&L leans on outside support: I
was told Jast Spring that if the fac-
ulty failed to close W&L, then thugs
from University of Virginia would.
This rebiance for speakers (Jane
‘Fonda, Rubin, et al), onganiza-
tional aid, and impetus from the out-
side is in sharp contrast to the Uni-
versity Republicans, who are as ac-
tive as any chub in the state, and
who, rather than relying on others,
themselves aid smaller and less ac-
tive clubs,

T .E. Lawrence, in “The Seven
Pillars of Wisdom,” observes that:
“All men dream: but not equally.
Those who dream by night in the
dusty recesses of their minds wake in
the day to find that it was vanity:
‘but the dreamers of the day are dan-
gerous men, for they may act their
dream with open eyes, to make it
possible.” In this vein, the radical
factions at Washington and Lee ap-
pear the dreamers of the night, and
their dreams evaporate when flush-
ed with the cold harshness of reality.
On the other hand, the dynamic aoti-
vities Of the conservative groups re-
veals them as the dreamers of the
day, for they truly HAVE worked to
make their dreams possible.

 

With Malice Toward Some

SCC And SAC: Why Both?

BY JEFFREY B. SPENCE

Hf one dissects any bureaucracy,
more often than not he will find that
the parts that make up the whole are
in the form of committees. Washing-
ton and Lee és no exception when i!
comes to having their fair share of
committees.

The student body has one com-
mittee that seems to be almost com-
pletely useless. The particular or-
ganization in question is the Student
Control Committee.

The reason this committee is use-
less? It does not do anything. It is
supposed to govern student behavior,
or rather, misbehavior when the act
committed is not within the realm of
the Honor System. Well, that may be
what 4 is supposed to do, but that is
not what it does do.

The Student Control Committee's
decisions about a student's behavior
are at all times subject to review by
the Student Affairs Committee. This
group is composed of five students
and five faculty members, all of
them having full voting privileges.
They are the ones who have the final
power in deciding any student's fate
if he is acoused of misconduct,

This appears to have an extreme
affect on the way the student run
committee operates. Student Control
is tke a pendulum in its decisions, It
awings back and forth between
strength and weakness in meting oul
punishment depending on whether
big daddy Student Affairs has recent.
ly slapped them on the knuckles.

if Student Control condemns a
student too harshly he may refer it
to the higher committee for review
There have been enough cases of
punishment reduction for him to feel
that he can get a reprieve. However,
if Student Control goes too easy on
someone that guy better be ready to
have to come before Student Affairs

Obviously W&L has one too many
disciplinary committees. The ques-
tion is which one do we eliminate?
if we get rid of the Student Affwir's

Commitiee, then some elements of

the faculty will complain that the
students either have too much power
or that they will ‘be too lenient on
each other when they get this power.
In other words, the practice of hell-
raising will immediately go on the
upswing, and besides, students aren't
mature enough to handle themselves.

The opposing side would see it
this way: W&L has a history of
keeping the faculty out of the stu-
dent's behavior problems which is
readily agreed to by both sides under
the auspices of the Honor System,
Even with all its difficulties, students
do not want a faculty-run Honor
Code,

Since we obviously have one too
many committees to run student
conduct, then something has got to
give. Therefore it is about time that
the Student Affair's Committee dis-
card and return the power to the peo-
ple of WAL, the students.

If we, the students, can be trusted
to run our own affairs of honor, then
certainly we should be able to run
our affairs of personal conduct. Isn't
that what being a gentleman on this
campus is all about? Assuredly con-
ducting oneself as a gentleman is
not limited to just matters of honor
as we define lying, cheating, and
stealing to be.

Gentlemanly conduct also extends
to personal relations with each other,
Thus, one can see no feason why
just a single, student controtied, com-
mittee cannot ajudicate the conduct
of students. If this committee needs
a higher authority to turn to, then let
it be an open jury trial as in the case
of our present Honor System. The
jury would still be composed of stu-
dents and thus it would be a trial by
one's peers.

Let us fet the faculty do what it is
paid to do, teach us and then judge
our performance in the learning pro-
cess. Let's allow the students to
judge themselves in personal con
duct. 4 we are mature enough to
judge our honor, then we are mature
enough to judge our actions, Peace

presence of the military relates to
the function of the University. The
punpose of a University is to help
build meaningful citizens of a so-
ciety. Any administration which al-
lows such an agency on their campus
is, I think, doing a disservice to
themselves, the students and the
good reputation of that school. Some
gay that ROTC builds leadership and
helps us defend ourselves. Now re-
read the second paragraph. Is that
the kind of leaders that you want
defending you? I think not! When
‘the army becomes an instrument of
tthe people, not against it, then let
them come back on campus. Until
that time it is our duty to tell them
to pack up and GET OUT!

The purpose of this letter is two-
fold. 1 wanted to express my own
Opinion and also raise some ques-
tions that need answering. The latter
is more important. It is time that
the students and faculty start re-
examining these issues. One might
be surprised at what you discover.
In any case, THINK!

Peacefully yours,
Leonard Z. Kaufmann ‘74
