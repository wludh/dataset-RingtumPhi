J. N. Thomas
Named Rector
Of The Board

The election of the Rev. John
Newton Thomas of Richmond, Va.,
as rector of the board of trustees
was announced today.

Dr. Thomas, a board member
since 1938, succeeds Dr. Huston St.
Olair of Surfside, Fla., rector for
the past five years. Dr. St. Clair will
remain as a member of the board.

The new rector is professor of
systematic theology at the Union
Theological Seminary in Richmond.
He earned his bachelor of arts de-
gree from Washington and Lee in
1924, and holds the M.A. and Ph.D.
degrees from Edinburgh University
(Scotland). In addition, he is a
bachelor of divinity graduate of
Union Theological, and was award-
ed an honorary doctor of divinity
degree in 1943 by Hampden-Sydney
College.

He is also a trustee of Mary Bald-
win College in Staunton, and served
successively as pastor of the Second
Presbyterian Church in Richmond,
prior to beginning his teaching duties
at Union Theologiacal in 1940.

Dr. St. Clair, who was president
of the Virginia State Chamber of
Commerce between 1944 and 1946,
is a 1922 graduate of Washington
and Lee. He served as a member
of the board’s executive committee
and was one of the two members on
a special scholarship selection com-
mittee.

Also announced by the University
was the election of Christopher 1.
Chenery of New York City as a
trustee emeritus. A former chairman
of the board of the Southern Na-
tural Gas Co. and an executive of
several other utility interests, Mr.
Chenery had first been elected to
board membership in 1950, He is a
1909 graduate of Washington and
Lee.

His retirement from active serv-
ice as a trustee was due to poor
health, according to the board's an-
nouncement today. In a resolution
of appreciation, his fellow trustees
described him as “a leader of in-
tegrity, wisdom and foresight.”

“Throughout the 62 years that
have passed since he enrolled as a
student here,” the resolution said,
“the university family has looked
with admiration and pride upon his
achievements as an engineer, indus-
trialist, sportsman, and good citizen
of a nation he loved.”

In further action, Washington and
Lee's trustees adopted a memorial
resolution to Mrs. Alfred 1. duPont,
also a trustee, who died Sept. 26.

Mrs. duPont, the first woman
elected to board membership in the
university's 221-year history, was its
most prominent benefactor. She had
contributed some $7 million to

EC Rules On Exam Schedule;
Law Elections On Monday

The Executive Committee voted
unanimously at its Monday meeting
to consider all independent exam
“hot.”

Senior Joe Tompkins brought up
the point that the faculty question-
ed a policy of keeping term exams
cold. He proposed that the current
EC recommendation of cold tests
remain in effect throughout the year
except for term exams during the
independent exam period. All term
exams will be hot until the end of
the examination period.

Law representative Jim Slay an-
nounced that the Law School elec-
tions will be held Monday, Octo-
ber 26 at 10:00 a.m. in the South
Room of Tucker Hall. The Fresh-
man Law Officers and Executive
Committee representative will be
selected.

Bill Millkey reported to the EC
wbout the Film Committee. He ex-
olained that the main problem con
cerning the committee is difficulty in
finding a place to show films rather
than the procurement of the films
themselves. In the past year the
committee has shown films in six
hocations, but none of the sites is
permanently available for the com-
mittee’s use. The Student Center
lacks space and proper projection
equipment for an adequate showing.

Bill Merrill and Mark McMinn
were recommended to head the Film
Committee by Bill Millkey. The EC
unanimously approved these ap-
pointments,

JoJo Martin, Chairman of the
University Center-Orientation Com-
mittee, appeared before the EC. Jo-
Jo proposed that the EC accept a
statement of policy for use of the
Cockpit.

The statement of policy olaims
that an organization can use the
Cockpit only if the organization
does not limit the use of the Cockpit
by other students or interferes with

regular business in the tavern. Also
an organization must gain approval
from the entire University Orienta-
tion Committee before it can use the
Cockpit.

Glenn Azuma moved to accept
‘his statement of policy. There was
no discussion and the proposal pass-
ed unanimously. The EC also ap-
proved the appointment of Thorton
Hardy to the University Center-
Orientation Committee.

it was announced that there are
openings for freshmen on four Stand-
ing Committees. These committees
are: University Center-Orientation,
Financial Relations (formerly Cold
Cheek), Library, and Curriculum.
Interested freshmen should give a
letter to Rich Murray, Secretary of
the Executive Committee, explain-
ing their qualifications and recom-
mendations for the committee.

Vice President Phil Thompson re-
ported briefly on the Honor System
Study Committee. Phil explained
that all W&L students are asked to
fill out the questionnaires about the

Honor System before this Friday.
Questionnaires can be found in the
Co-op, in front of Washington Hall,
and in the Commons.

When all these questionnaires and
recommendations are returned, the
committee will study them. Any new
ideas and worthwhile suggestions
brought out by these questionnaires
will be discussed before the entire
EC.

Jim Slay also announced that he
had contacted the Legal Aide Re-
search Society. The group agreed to
study the legal aspects of the new
local car tag tax.

Joe Tompkins introduced a pro-
posal from an unnamed senior. The
proposal was that President Fran
Lawrence undergo psychotherapy
for 20 weeks as an aid in performing
his duties. Staman Ogilvie moved to
amend the proposal so that Law-
rence would also cut his hair. Both
the proposal and subsequent amend-
memt were soundly defeated.

All members of the Executive
Committee were present.

Yogi Expert To Lecture
At duPont Hall Thursday

Charles Donahue of the Students’
International Meditation Society
will speak on Thursday, October 22,
at 4:00 p.m. in duPomt Auditorium.
His subject will be transcendental
meditation as taught by Maharishi
Mahesh Yogi.

Ihis is a technique of meditation
for exceeding the conscious mind
and tapping the reservoir of creative
intelligence. According to the Medi-
tation Society, TM is an ancient
technique that is completely safe,
natural and spontaneous. It can be

Solomon Paintings & Original Graphics
Will Be Shown In duPont Art Gallery

Iwo very different yet equally en-
gaging exhibits will be on display at
the duPont Art Gallery during the
course of the week. The first, a set
of large paintings by Jack Solomon
of Commonwealth University in
Richmond, opened here last Thurs-
day. The second exhibition, consist-
ng of original graphics by classic
and contemporary artists, will be
presented in duPont for one day
only on Monday, October 26.

The Solomon paintings are repre-
semiative of the artist's latest work,
all the paintings having been com-
vleted during the past few months
especially for this show. The ten ab-
stracts were painted with liquitex on
canvas, and all are titled after stars,
from Algol to Regulus.

Each of the compositions, meas
uring seven feet by five-and-a-half
evolves from horizontal and
erid patterns with subile
modulations within the grid
squares. The canvases are “shaped,”
nol framed in the conventional rec
tangles, but rather in odd geometric
polygons. The coloring technique is
im the vein of “op art,” in which the
painter oblains optical effects which

Dr. Doyon emphasized that the
etchings and lithographs on display
are originals by the artist's own
hand. “Each print is signed by the
artist and probably numbered,” he
said, “The more limited number of
prints executed by the artist, the
more expensive they will be. The
works with the lower numbers will
most likely be the more valuable,
since the first compositions will be
more fresh and precise.”

Mr. Dennis Martin of the Roten
Galleries will be on hand to answer
any questions regarding graphic art
and printmaking.

Dr. Doyon expressed his enthusi-
asm with future exhibits being en-

 

gaged for duPont Gallery. “We are
planning two shows a month and are
already arranging the exhibits three
years in advance.” He emphasized
also the variety which the shows
will be taking on. “In the past we
have been limited mainly to painting
and sculpture in the contemporary
idiom. Now we want to expand our
scope to include both the past and
the present, and at the same time to
become more international.”

He gave as an example a major
show of photography from Ger
many, scheduled to appear at WAI
in two years. The exhibit will in-

clude 522 photos from 32 countries
by 230 photographers. He also not-
ed that exhibits preceding Christmas
in future years will focus on crafts,

the only pre-requisite is that a per-
son be off drugs for at least fifteen
days prior to initiation into actual
participation.

Persons involved in the course of-
fered by the SIMS meditate for 15
minutes each morning and evening.
During this period of meditation,
the Society claims, the entire sys-
tem receives a rest even more pro-
found than deep sleep. Tension and
stress are relieved and the meditator
rises feeling calmer, more energetic
and with a clearer mind. No advanc-
ed yoga positions are taught in the
course,

The transcendental technique had
reputedly been lost for centuries
when the Maharishi'’s Master recov-
ered it and revived the technique in
its purity. Now the method is avail-
able on a world-wide scale; the SIMS
has enrolled over 40,000 students
on over 300 campuses in the United
States alone.

Donahue will appear in the Cock-

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Of Bike Disasters, Happiness And France

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
OCTOBER 21, 1970

The “Town Vs. Gown” Turmoil

Dr. Wilfred J. Ritz, professor of law at W&L, made a very
funny comment on page 3B of the News-Gazette this past
October 14. Not many students are laughing about it because
they probably haven't read his letter to the editor of the News-
Gazette. Not many leaders in the City of Lexington are laugh-
ing about it because they certainly must have read it. No one
will laugh after reading what we have to say about it.

It appears to us that Dr. Ritz’s lengthy legal analysis of the
validity of students’ right to vote in local elections has inaugu-
rated another partially informed chapter in the continuing
story of Lexington’s own “Town vs. Gown” serial which be-
gan last year when the City Council announced that students
would be required to purchase tags for their motor vehicles.

For some time, we, along with Dr. Ritz and others, con-
sidered the tag requirement to be a tax upon students vehicles.
According to City Manager Guy Agnor, this fee for the tag is
not officially regarded as a tax; rather it is considered as a
“usage fee” which students must pay if they have an automo-
bile. The theory behind this fee is that students ought to
share in supporting the maintenance of the streets in Lexing-
ton since they use them as much as permanent residents. It is
not a property tax. (The property tax on cars within the city
limits is presently $4.40 per $100 valuation.)

This toll for the maintenance of the streets of the city has
nothing and everything to do with Dr. Ritz’s revelation that
students are at present able to register as qualified voters in
Lexington. The fee has nothing to do with the voting issue be-
cause any student could elect to claim over six months’ resi-
dency within the city limits and therefore register to vote in
Lexington elections whether he owned an automobile or not ;
Dr. Ritz made this point clear in his letter of October 14.

What Dr. Ritz did not mention was the small matter of real
and personal property taxes, a property tax on one’s car and
Virginia state income tax which a student would have to pay
if he were registered to vote in Lexington. We imagine the
Lexington City Council has chosen not to tax student's per-
sonal property because of the enormous expense that each stu-
dent would face in meeting tax requirements just in order to
vote in city elections.

Sut perhaps our imagination is a little too wild. Consider
for a moment the enormous revenue the city would accrue
from a property tax levied on the real and personal property
of students. And the state of Virginia wouldn’t mind a little
extra money by way of income tax on W&L and VMI stu-
dents. Spending a little money on a city license tag fee (not
property tax) is not such a bad idea when we consider that so
far at least the city has no plans to place property taxes on
students. And as City Manager Agnor explained, the money
from the fee goes into a general fund and is transferred directly
to a road maintenance budget which is prepared by the City
Manager each year. So, the way it stands now, a student can
elect to pay property taxes by registering to vote.

But were the City Council to decide to place property taxes
upon students residing in this city, they would give the stu-
dents no choice: register to vote or be caught by their own
lassitude in the old familiar situation of “taxation without
representation.” We trust the City Council will not attempt
to rip the lid off of Pandora's box by instituting property taxes
upon students.

Six Paragraphs Of Levity

Every so often we run across bits of humor about our camp-
us which strike us as significant enough material to pass along
to our readers. By simply relating these rib-tickling anec-
dotes or chuckle-provoking vignettes, we hope that our read-
ers will realize the intense comedy of human affairs, and the
sheer buffoonery of all human endeavor, Or of most human en-
deavor.

Take for instance the Executive Committee meeting Mon-
day night. Normally the leaders of student government at this
institution are intensely organized, highly efficient, and ex-
tremely business-like in all their affairs; yet this past Monday
night a little touch of humanity was added to the regularly
strict decorum: the EC voted against a proposal to apportion
unlimited funds in order to commit president Fran Lawrence
for 20 weeks of psychiatric treatment,

\pologizing to the press for the momentary break from
tense grappling with pressing issues was vice president Phil
Thompson, who termed the intermission “10 minutes of le-
vity.” And it was that.

We feel now that we ourselves must swerve away from the
temptation of being completely humorous, for editorials
should be instructive and often opinionated, Therefore, we are
of the opinion that more students should take an interest in
their student government. We furthermore instruct you, our
readers. to attend an Executive Committee meeting in the near
future. It would be well worth the while of every student to
experience at least once the astounding speed and organiza-
tion with which each meeting is conducted, as well as the clar-
ity of every decision the EC makes

All seriousness aside, though, we can't help but concur with
Fran Lawrence's two comments which concluded the witty
melee: “I've never had such a good time in my life,” and “I
don't see why we can’t run meetings informally.’

One comment which we can't understand was uttered by
secretary Rich Murray in reply to Mr. Lawrence's jibe that
meetings should be run more informally “We do.”

(Editor’s Note—Bob Gill, a politics
major, was one of four Washington
and Lee participants in the Sweet
Briar College Junior Year in France,
which included 99 students from 26
colleges and universities. Members
of the group, after an intensive six-
week program in Tours which in-

Happiness is directing a native of
Bordeaux from Notre Dame to the
Arc de Triomphe. Happiness is un-
derstanding his language. And hap-
piness is, I believe, the capacity to
understand him at least a little bet-
ter than your compatriot, the Ameri-
can tourist. Happiness is the feeling
of wind in your hair—whether on
the way up M. Eiffel’s celebrated
tour or on the Autoroute du Sud on
a weekend hitch “home” to see
“your family” there. Happiness is
riding in the middle of a truck cab
whose driver stopped to pick up
your girl, now huddled in the corner.
And, yes, happiness is that cold
Paris rain.

I find inspiration in the thought
that dear Madame will soon be pour-
ing sparkling Vichy water (coupled
with a bite of that old French cure-
all, ham) down the mouth of another
sick but unwilling American stu-
dent. Monsieur still worries about
his liver. Cheeses are still sold on
rue Marbeuf, flowers on Ile de la
Cite, and traveler's checks on Ave-
nue Scribe.

The hordes of
American and
European tourists

The

whose annual in- Junior
vasion of France
begins in early Year
June have for Abroad
the most part

gone home by September 16, our
landing date. The Cunard pier was
thus relatively uncrowded as the
Sweet Briar group prepared to meet
its first member of the French bur-
eaucracy, an unsmiling fonctionnaire
of the customs service. Having clear-
ed customs, our people were ready
to encounter a second aspect of
French life—the labor strike. Four
funny little French buses were wait-
ing to take us to Tours, on account
of a national railway strike. I was
to remenrber this introduction to
France on many occasions—as I ate
breadless sandwiches due to a bak-
ers’ strike, sat in Orly waiting for
my parents’ flight to unload during
a ground crew strike, or sat watching
a performance in an Opera lit only
iby candlelight during an electrical
workers’ strike (and this a month
after the scheduled performance
date due to a singers’ strike!). Mem-
bers of the Sweet Briar group would
spend hours in a city choked by
metro strikes and dirtied by a gigan-
tic garbage collectors’ strike.

On the bus, those of us sober and/
or awake enough to care remarked
upon the French houses, French
cows, French grass and French girls
we passed as the bus radio blared
out old Beatles songs. We spent the
night in a French hotel in the French
town of Caaen, surrounded by
French medieval ruins in which, to
my regret, | soon became lost in
the French coffee in a cafe, and I
suppose | would thus have to say
that my first night in Caaen was
one of my most memorable. Next
day, on the way to Tours, we visited
the cathedral of Le Mans, one of
France's most beautiful (“So you've
seen your first cathedral.” my
French4eacher aunt would cynically
write.) In Tours we were introduced
to our French families, and the dis-
may of Madame was evident when
she heard my first words of French.
My first were to be my last for an
entire day, until | decided that a
year punctuated only by an accasion-
al “oui” would be too much for even
me to handle.

Those beautiful fall days seem in
retrospect perhaps the mosi mean-
ingful of the year, at least for me.
My family was blessed with a son
and two lovely daughters, and a
mother who loved to cook. Even
now when | think of France I think
first of them. Reflecting on those
days in Tours brings to mind a maze
of memories of picnics with friends
along the Loire, or of our delight
ful conversation classes held in cafes

afternoon. Provincial France is bi-

bread, and a bottle of wine—and off
wed gO, sometimes leaving af 7:00
to get those first 20 kilometers be

hind us before the heavy traffic be-
gan. In this way I saw some 18 cha-
teaux—not hurriedly as an Ameri-
can tourist would do, but one or two
at a time—and ate picnics on some
f the most beautiful lawns and
ruins in Europe. In the process, I
also acquired a considerable interest
in French history, without even aud-
iting History 363.

Berthenay—it could have been
any of a million French hamlets—a
handful of little houses, a decaying
church, and of course a cafe. Yet it
was in Berthenay that my room-
mate, our dates and I realized that
somehow we'd missed that turnoff to
Azay-le-Rideau some 20 kilometers
back. The solution? After an hour in
the cafe, and having posed for pic-
tures by the town’s one highway
sign, we retraced our tread marks.
But—the day was still young and,
shortly after our picnic lunch (eaten
this time in a deserted wine cave), I
veered my bike a little too far to the
left and—wham! There I was, flat
on my back, with a Bryn Mawr girl
on top. Carrying the bike 5 kilo-
meters for repairs was no fun. Yet,
of all my memories, this day was to
‘be the most cherished.

Paris, a French friend in Tours
once told me, is like Tours—only in
Paris the cars don’t stop for cyclists.
So it was that, in late October, Sweet
Briar arrived in Panis. Happiness, I
assure you, is your first sight of the
Tour Eiffel. Meeting the new family
in Reid Hall, the American center,
my French once again rose to the
occasion. Oh, well. I was to live four
blocks from the Champs-Elysses and
two from the Avenue George V. All
the sights I had seen until now—Mi.
St. Michel, Chenonceau, Amboise,
and the cathedral of Chartres—fad-
ed as we whisked by the Place de la
Concorde on our way home. Two
hours later, my roommate and I
were on the streets. We covered
Paris that night—on foot and in the
rain, two factors which would be
proved significant by the passage of
time.

Paris is so many things to so
many people that it would seem pre-
sumptuous for me to babble off per-
sonal inypressions. Paris is art, music,
poetry, dancing, and beauty. Paris is
also metro strikes, traffic jams, and
a cold, driving rain. Paris is a city of
incomparable beauty. It is the city of
the Louvre, of the Place des Vosges,

and of those famous caves and bis-

troes. Paris is the city of Napoleon,
Louis Philippe, and deGaulle. Paris
is Hitler dancing a jig, or brooding
alone early one morning in an empty
Comedie Francaise. For me there
are two proofs of Hitler's insanity.
One is his treatment of the Jews.
The second is his plan to destroy the
city of Paris. Paris is also Benjamin
Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, Vol-
taire and Diderot, Cocteau and Sar-
tre. Many of the world’s greatest
thoughts and philosophies, paintings
and compositions, had their start in
Paris.

Paris is also, as we were to dis-
cover, a city of students. At the Sor-

bonne, at Sciences-Po, in the student
cafes, in the cheaper restaurants,
were students of every nationality.
The Universite de Paris is the big-
gest conglomeration of schools and
institutes in France, claiming some
20,000 English majors alone. And
the French university system ‘is, I as-
sure you, French logic and organiza-
tion at its most absurd.

Grades on the year’s work for
those lucky enough to gain accep-
tance into the University are deter-
mined by one 15 minute oral exam
per course, and anything goes com-
me question, Most American stu-
dents complained of a system in
which creative thinking is actually
discouraged. In ithe course of the
year, each student had several ex-
poses, or oral reports, to deliver be-
fore each class.

 

What was said was unimportant:
students were graded on their ability
to speak neither more nor less than
10 minutes, and on their subject di-
visions, Each expose was expected to
have two central points, two sub-
points, under the central ones, and
two sub-subpoints under each of
vhese. Time allowed for each of
these was expected to be the same.
Foreign students, like their French
friends before them, soon learned to
beat his system. Sweet Briar stu-
dents came home enriched in many
ways. Few of them, I believe, came
back with a preference for the
French university.

1 for one found consolation for

my distaste of the French university
system in my professors, all of
whom are internationally known
political scientists. And few people
have the opportunity to study French
are not from slides but face-to-face
in the Louvre. I read few french
plays; | saw them. And the cafes,
museums, bookstores, and Paris in
general provided personal academic
stimuli for American students where
formal academic studies might not
have sufficed. And, overall, the most
important factor of our experience
as I see it was the opportunities it
provided of entering into a people
and a culture at least partially differ-
ent from our own, Many sacred cows
lie buried, then, in Paris,

During vacation periods and over
several week-ends, I traveled to
other parts of Europe, and ‘to the

“rench Riviera. Yet I can truly say
that I was never sorry or disappoint-
ed to return home to Paris. Rainy
days melted into rainy days for me
as they had for Francois Villon,
Voltaire, Moliere and Monet —
though this thought did not occur to
me until much later.

Paris represents much of that
which is right—and wrong—with
the world. For me, it will always
represent something very fine. Per-
haps my friend was more right than
he knew when he toasted Paris at a
farewell party our last night there—
“During 8 months we have been a
part of Paris. And Paris, in her turn,
has become a part of us.”

New York and Sweetwater Make Profit;
Dance Board Has A Healthier Budget

BY ROY CARLTON

An overwhelming response to the
University Dance Board's first con-
cert of the season has cased con-
siderably the Board's woes of earlier
in the year, Ticket sales at the door
and for the week preceding the con-
cert were the greatest in memory,
and, if the trend continues, should
salvage the year. Projecting a mini-
mum of ticket sales for future con-
certs, the Board is now able to make
some concrete plans for future con-
certs.

Response to the New York Rock
Ensemble-—Sweetwater concert was
tremendous, Although the Board
has only sold 450 Dance Plans prior
to the week of the concert, revenues
from additional Dance Plan and
ticket sales approached $2500 dur-
ing that week. An additional 200
tickets were sold at the door. The re-
sult was a VMI Pield House capa-
city crowd,

The audience wasn't disappointed
either, Despite technical problems
(not acoustical) between shows, both
New York and Sweetwater drove
the audience into a frenzy. In faci,
when New York came onstage, near
ly a third of the audience defyed the
cordons and moved onto the center
of the gym floor wirrounding the
stage. After a great deal of coercion
by concert officials and even New
York, the crowd was finally moved
off the floor

As of this writing, the Dance
Board stil has some $14,000 with
which to finance four more con
certs in addition to Charlie Byrd on
November 13. This is not taking into
consideration door sales which may
he expected to boost revenues con
wderably. Nev ertheless

withoul any

reliable estimate of how much this
added income will amount to, te
Board is still in a compromising s-
uation. A big help would be increas-
ed Dance Plan sales. The plans are
now being offered at a reduced price
of $35 which still represents a sav
ings over individual tickets with five
more concerts projected.

Current Dance Board plans cail
for some four concerts in the secon!
semester and short term, There will
be a January concert, a March con
cert and an April concert. Possibly
one of these weekends will be two

nights of concerts, or there will be a
<sparate weekend for the fourth con
cert. Definite dates have not been
chosen so as to afford the oBard
maximum latitude in contracting en
tertainment.

Currently under consideration are
John Sebastian, the Allman Brothers
Band, Neil Young, li's A Beauti
ful Day, Sha-na-na and Poco. The
proposed James Taylor concert has
once more fallen through following
another hike in his fee, When Tay-
lor aws first sought, last May, his

BY ROBERT BAROODY

Once again, right on schedule, the
Washington and Lee Mock Conven-
tion is drifting into newsprint. Tra-
ditionally, the Mock Convention was
The Great Event shared in common
‘by several generations of W&L men;
today it would be a ridiculous and
pathetic anachronism, Without sen-
timental pause, the 1972 edition of
the Mock Convention should be im-
mediately cancelled.

I make this proposal in full knowl-
edge that past Mock Conventions,
from William Jennings Bryan to
Richard Milhous Nixon, have often
assumed a national importance of
their own. Let us now have the fore-
sight to abandon what has become
an obstinate and oppressive habit;
moreover, What would be a waste of
our time, money, and energy.

Most students, never having ex-
perienced a Mock Convention, might
ibe curious to know just what they
would ‘be missing. Naive freshman
that I was, I left the 1968 event
with a distinct impression: that year’s
extravaganza was initially somewhat
amusing, but rapidly degenerated
into an exercise in boredom and bad
taste, Perhaps it would be a good
idea to poll members of the cur-
rent senior class concerning their in-
dividual impressions.

To state that the Mock Conven-
tion is ridiculous may not be reason
enough for its discontinuation. Those
desirous of something more substan-
tial may consider the following:

(1) The real Party Convention is
a political institution of the past;
it has been and is a travesty of the
democratic process. Equally damn-
ing is the fact that, Democratic or
Republican, the Party Convention
is specifically designed to neglect the

opinions of students and young vot-
ers. Who are we mocking but our-
selves?

(2) It costs too much. Finance Di-
rector Mike Miles claimed a budget
of $6,700 for the 1968 central com-
mittee. He also noted that state dele-
gations would spend an additional
$8,000 of their own money. No stu-
dent should be assessed for the rais-
ing of either of these sums.

(3) In the past, chairmen of the
Mock Convention have prided them-
selves on the authenticity of “their”
event. If simulation is the goal in
1972, are the organizers prepared to
extend an invitation to the National
Guard, authentically laden with gen-
uine canisters of CS gas?

(4) Is it so wonderful to mimic the
fifty-year-old, Order of the Moose
buffoons who cavort about in moro-
nic insensibility when called to the
task of determining our national
leaders? A Mock Convention gener-
ates and nurtures precisely the game
mentality that I referred to last
week. The transformation of “that
guy in my poly sci class” to a beady-
eyed power broker was an intriguing
sideshow of the 1968 exhibition.

Finally, I should have to admit
that notwithstanding these remarks,
the cancellation of next year’s con-
vention may already be an inevitabil-
ity. You, tahe Post-Ohicago genera-
tion, are far too sophisticated, bull-
proof to lend your support to such
a hopeless relic. In the past, the
Mock Convention served the pur-
pose of educating those who were
not yet acquainted with the filth of
political reality. Moratorium, Hunt-
ley - Brinkley - Cronkite, National
Guard, Yippies, Lobbies, Strike;
you've been there, let them find an-
other stooge.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

A Response To ‘‘Pulling

Out Of A Crash Dive”
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

While I appreciate your generous
evaluation of my stewardship of the
1968 Mock Republican National
Convention, in a recent editorial en-
titled “Pulling Out of a Crash Dive,”
I must take issue with you for the
sake of accuracy.

From material I have been receiv-
ing from the leaders of the 1972
Mock Convention, it seems to me
that the 1972 Mock Convention is
much farther along and much better
organized than we were at this point
three years ago. Mr. Silberberg has
methodically organized the work of
the 1972 Mock Convention in a way
which eluded us in preparing for the
last Mock Convention, and therefore
the invidious comparison suggested
in your editorial seems to me unfair.

What you call Mr. Silberberg’s
“chronic ‘begging syndrome”  oc-
curred many times before the 1968
convention as well. Because the Exe-
cutive Committee then was less co-
operative and less sensible of the im-
portance of the Mock Convention
than is the present committee, the
Mock Convention’s finances were
started by a personal loan taken out
at the Rockbridge National Bank by
the convention secretary, Jim Lowe,
and me.

Money given by the EC to the
Mock Convention is one of the best
investments that can be made for
Washington and Lee. Besides provid-
ing a rich and unusual exercise in
political gamesmanship, the Mock
Convention represents one of the
most potent public relations oppor-
tunities the university has.

I have been told by chairmen of
previous mock conventions, and have
found their opinion to be correct

from my own experience, that stu-
dent government support for the
convention has always been grudging
up until just before the convention.
This penury, which necessitates con-
vention chairmen “begging” for
money, is a false economy.

The Mock Convention deserves all
the support the EC can give it, es-
pecially when it’s being as well man-
aged as it is under Mr. Silberberg. I
recall all too vividly the charges of
inefficiency levelel at the Mock Con-
vention when I was chairman, al-
though—unlike Mr. Silberberg—I
had the estimate advantage of being
editor of The Ring-tum Phi. There
are better targets for editorials than
the Mock Convention.

Outlines Pass-Fail Plan

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

The following proposals concern-
ing Pass-Fail grades have been sub-
mitted to the Faculty Executive
Committee, the Faculty Curriculum
Committee, and the Student Body
Executive Committee by the Student
Curriculum Committee.

The Committee proposes that:

1. Students wishing to take all
their courses on a Pass-Fail basis be
permitted to declare their intention
of doing so when they reach the be-
ginning of their junior year, or when
they declare their major, whichever
comes first.

2. Students be permitted to oper-
ate under a program made up en-
tirely of Pass-Fail courses or under
the current, applicable Pass-Fail reg-
ulations. (The Committee believes
that, in general, students should be

BY GREG RAETZ

Undaunted by last year’s plebiscite
defeat, Student Body President Fran
Lawrence is pushing ahead with
plans for the fulfillment of one of
his campaign pledges — to change
the Honor System at Washington and
Lee.

Fortunately, however, it is the
student body which ultimately will
decide the fate of Mr. Lawrence's
project; and if they give it any
thought at all, they will soon realize
how unnecessary and ridiculous a
change in this area would be.

First of all, why are Mr. Law-
rence and the EC so worried about
the honor system? Do they know
something we don't know about the
Students attending or now entering
Washington and Lee? Do they some-
how feel that these students are more
prone to lie, cheat or steal? In other
words, don’t they have any faith in
the Now Generation?

The honor concept is not a tyr-
anny before which we cower every
day. The is that 99.9% of the
student body will have no contact
with the punitive aspects of the
honor system beyond witnessing the
mock trial at the beginning of the
freshman year. The honor code sim-
ply asks us to act as gentlemen. This
isn't very much to ask and the in-
junction isn’t very hard to follow.
Every incoming freshman knows this
one simple rule, and if he does not
think that he can adhere to this
minimum requirement of conduct,
he should not attend Washington and
Lee.

Of course there are those who will
say that extenuating circumstances
often exist and therefore make ex-
pulsion too harsh a penalty. | would
Suggest to them that “extenuating

circumstances” are few in number
and that I can think of none which
could excuse a student’s plagiarizing
a term paper or copying a class-
mate’s test.

In instances where there are doubts
or questions (all of us remember
how the mock trial came out) the
EC can acquit, and has acquitted,
the defendant, and rightly so. No
one wants to see an innocent or un-
wittingly guilty person thrown out of
school. Thus a method for dealing
with “extenuating circumstances”
has been built into the system.

The substitution of a year's sus-
pension for the so-called absolute
penalty is, I think, therefore an idle
proposal. An honor trial takes into
consideration all of the variables
and decides between guilt and in-
nocence. If the accused is innocent,
no more is said; but if he is guilty,
ihe is and should be asked to leave
the University—permanently. There
are too many men desiring to enter
W&L who are both academically
and ethically qualified to allow the
reinstatement of those who have
shown their contempt for gentle-
manly honor.

Basketballers Rebuild

BY PALMER TRICE

If one searches deep enough into
the depths of the sports pages, evi-
dence of the start of basketball sea-
son can be found. Such evidence
can also be found within the con-
fines of Doremus Gymnasium, as the
new season begins to unfold. Coach
Verne Canfield has a tough act to
follow. For the last four years, the
Generals have gone 75-24, a per-
centage of 68.8. Led by Mel Cart-
wright and Mike Neer, the Washing-
ton and Lee roundballers had the
best record of any team in the state.

Asked how he planned to replace
these two invaluable stars, Coach
Canfield replied, “We don’t replace
ballplayers like that.” This year’s
team will have a new look.

There are five returning letter-
men, including captain Mike Dan-
iel, who averaged about 15 points a
game last year as a sophomore. The
other veterans include Ellie Gut-
shall, Dave Stone, John Glace, and
Paul McClure. A welcomed addi-
tion to the squad is Charlie Strain, a
transfer from the University of
South Carolina. Charlie should pro-
vide a potent offensive punch. One
of the most promising freshman is
Skip Lichtfuss. He has made the
varsity squad. To compete with these
players are a “slew of sophomores.”
This makes for a team that is both
young and experienced. To make
sure that he has the best five, Coach
Canfield plans not to name his start-
ers until the last week of preseason
practice.

Due to the loss of two such noted
starters, Coach has changed both his
offensive and defensive systems. The
offense will be led by the point man.
This player will be the key to the
General attack. His movements will
reveal which of the options of the
attack that the other four should
take. These options are plays of a
sort, except that the players are not
bound by them. They may make ad-
justments when, and as often as the
situation demands. The basic offen-
sive set-ups will be the 1-4, the 1-3-1,
and the 1-2-2. The Generals will
run, but not often.

Defensively, the Generals will
show both a man for man and a
match defense. The match is a com-
bination of the man and the zone.
This defense brought W&L national

ranking two years ago. Daniel and
Co. plan to be very aggressive.
Among their tricks will be much
trapping. A multitude defensive sys-
tem will be used. During the course
of a game, several defenses will be
employed. Among their repertoire
will be the press.

The ballclub faces a tough sche-

dule, including Navy and Virginia.
The locations of away games ranges
from New York City for a weekend
to Florida for a tournament. Coach
Canfield feels that this year many
teams will be out to get us, after the
slim pickings of the past few sea-
sons.
Look for an exciting, determined
Washington and Lee team. Team
should be the watchword for this
year’s squad. They are a closely knit
bunch of boys. Coach Canfield calls
them “the most dedicated of all the
players” that he has coached. The
Opening game is on December 1 at
Doremus against the highly touted
Randolph-Macon Yellow Jackets.
The Yellow Jackets are the only
team that Coach Canfield’s round-
ball squads have never beaten. This
is the year.

Ruggers Over
Tarheels, 18-0

In a match completely dominated
by W&L, the Generals came up with
an easy 18-0 victory over the second-
string Tarheels of North Carolina.

W&L jumped out to an early lead
when Sandy Snead scooped up a
loose ball and ran five yards into the
Carolina end-zone. Fred Fletcher
followed with the conversion to
make the score 5-0. The next few
minutes passed with W&L constant-
ly threatening but unable to put the
points on the scoreboard. Finally
however with five minutes remain-
ing in the half, Bill Oast scored after
a loose scrum inside the UNC end
zone. Fletcher made the point after
thus hiking the score to 10-0.

In the second half, W&L con-
tinued to control the match. John
Griffith broke on a thirty yard dash
for an apparent score but was called
back for failure to ground the ball.

A few minutes later though Grif-
fith rammed over the goal line, and
after the kick the score was 15-0.
The game ended at 18-0 when
Tommy Baker burst over after tak-
ing a pass from Al GaNun,

Chris Murray and Hal St. Clair
had an excellent day offensively and
deserve special mention.

The Ruggers meet Lynchburg on
Sunday at 2:00 p.m. on the upper
field.

But in fact, it is only a Wa'shing-
ton and Lee student and his date in
search of a new way to have a week-
end of fun—camping. With the
warm weather of the past few weeks
and the woodsy surroundings, con-
ditions around Lexington have been
excellent for such jaunts.

Several of my friends have been
taking these sojourns into the wilds,
so with a little prodding from a fra-
ternity companion, I embarked on
my first encounter with the environ-
ment of Southwest Virginia. Hud
and I returned with our Hollins
dates and with a maximum of food
and a minimum of foresight and
planning, the four of us drove to the
Peaks of Otter campground up on
the Blue Ridge Parkway, just south-
east of Buena Vista.

What we found there made the
backyard of the fraternity house
seem more and more inviting. A
miniature township of campers had
erected their tents and unhitched
their trailers in preparation for a
night which we knew would be
chilly at best. Disappointed by the
hustle and bustle from which we had
sought to escape, we made our way
back towards the B.V. cutoff until
‘we approached a small resting place
off to the side of the Parkway. With
night coming on, and no one in
sight, we decided to choose Otter
Creek as our home for the next 18
hours.

We hurriedly pitched camp, build-
ing a small fireplace with the usual
necessary precautions, and went
about preparing supper. Boy Scout

Camping: Twosome Style

 

monn!

Hud soon had a roaring blaze goin;
(which we later found out to be il
legal, since we were not in a camp
ground) on which we cooked ho
dogs. Hud also suffered mass lacera
tions when he tried to open the cat
of beans with a knife since we lack
ed a can opener,

Otter Creek provided us with ;
refrigerator in which we stashed ou
liquid refreshment. After  visitins
with a few of the local denizens
namely a box turtle and a couple o
raccoons, we crammed ourselevs in
to our sleeping bags (only two were
available for the four of us). Two tc
a bag was not too bad, but the fac
that the ground was slanted and in
credibly rocky did not lend to ar
exactly fitless sleep.

We half-consciously labored thro
ugh the night, plagued by crampec
quarters, the cold, and a_ blinding
moon, Having contemplated the
difficulties of the night before, we
bagged the idea of cooking break
fast, dutifully cleaned our campsite
and returned to Big Lex and the
comforts of home.

In retrospect, I immensely enjoy+
ed our little invasion of the hinter-
lands, but to be honest, it will be
a warm spring night before I do if
again,

Generals Break Losing Streak;
Top Tufts Jumbos In 35-34 Win

BY PETER JONES

The Washington and Lee Generals
opened their offensive steam valves,
charged ahead full speed into Tufts,
and emerged from the wild scoring
spree with their first vietory of the
season, 35-34.

Not only did the Generals score
more points in this game than they
had in their four previous games
combined, but they produced the
Small College Player of the Week
in Virginia, namely sophomore
quarterback Steve Fluharty. He com-
pleted 19 of 30 attempts for 307
yards, 15 of those completions to
end “Chief” Mahaffey for 256 yards.

The lead in the game changed

more times than a chameleon
changes color on a camuflaged suit;
a total of six times. Tufts began the
game determined to shame the Gen-
erals early by receiving the opening
kick-off and driving 61 yards in five
plays to score with only 3:30 gone
in the first quarter. After the con-
version, they led 7-0.

The Generals received the kick
and opened their offense on very
shaky legs. On their third play, Tufits
recovered a loose ball and quickly
converted a field goal of 27 yards to
raise their lead to 10-0 with 10:25
remaining in the quarter.

Upon again receiving the kick, the
Blue could this time do nothing

wrong. Three pass completions to
Mahaffey on third down situations
brought the ball down to the Tufts
12 yard line, from where JoJo Mar-
tin, who gained a total of 114 yards
rushing, scampered in with the first
W&L score with 6:33 still left in
the first quarter. Harris’ conversion
was good and the Generals were
back in the game, 10-7.

Again in possession of the ball,
Tufts rambled downfield until they
met tough opposition from Frank
Evans, Dave Brooks, George Harris
and Marshall Washburn on the
W&L 20. Another field goal at-
tempt, this from 37 yards out, was
good and Tufts vaulted its lead, 13-7.

Amazingly enough, the Generals
actually showed an explosive offense
on their next possession. In only
four plays, the big one a 50 yard
pass and run from Fluharty to Ma-
haffey, they tied the score and then
went ahead for the first time on
Harris’ conversion, 14-13, with 2:50
still left in the wild first quarter.

The lead was fleeting, though, as
Tufts again drove down to the W&L
20 with a first down. On fourth and
six, a Tufts halfback broke loose
and ran 16 yards to score, with
13:30 remaining in the half. The
two-point conversion run was good

deep into Tufits territory, to the 14
and the three yard lines, but both
time lack of downs killed the oppor-

inity to go ahead, The half ended
21-14, Tufits’ lead.

The third quarter had W&L stamp-
ed all over it. After fumbling away
on their own 27, the Generals dug in
and halted Tufts and their field goal
attempt; the turning point in the
game. On the next possession, Flu-
harty guided the Blue 80 yards, aid-
ed by two completions to Green
and one to Mahaffey, and scored
the touchdown himself on a 5 yard
run with 8:38 left in the quarter
Harris’ conversion tied the score at
21-21.

George Harris then recovered a
Tufts fumble afiter the kick-off and,
with Martin's gallop of 43 yards to
the Tufts two yard line, Fluharty
sneaked over, capping a 62 yard
drive, for his second T.D. and put
W&L in the lead again, 27-21. The
PAT kick failed.

Tufts managed to revive and come
back with a 53 yard drive, climaxed
by a two-yard sprint on the first
play of the fourth quarter. The con-
version sent Tufts back into the lead,
28-27.

Under pressure, Fluharty led his
team, with three completions to Ma-

 

Steve Mahaffey took this one for \a fifty yard pass reception and touch-

down.

On Girls, Winter

Have you ever wondered about athletics at a girls school?

 

It’s something you don’t really think about, but it’s a very im-
portant aspect of their education. Just like us, they have re-
quired P.E. and indulge in sports like swimming, tennis, bowi-
ing, badminton, and hockey.

Most girls take the sports far less seriously than the ad-
ministration, but there are those lovely lasses who live each
day to charge onto the field and join in combat.

As I see it, there are three types of girls who participate in
women’s athletics: the “jock,” the pretty young thing, and the
not-so-pretty young thing.

The “jock” is by far the most serious. You see her for the
most part on the sidelines huffing and puffing and discussing
game strategy. She’s always sweaty, her hair tied in a pig-
tail. She’s good, but a little too serious.

The pretty young thing is obviously my favorite. She's
normally so dainty that the slightest incident flusters her ter-
ribly. Being so intent is attractive for her; she knows it.

The not-so-pretty young thing tries the hardest on the field.
The athletic field is an outlet for her, and she loses her identity
there. That is good.

It's funny how you never hear about women’s intercollegi-
ate athletics. But it could be a great spectator idea. We should
take greater notice of it. Just think of tuning in on an NCAA
women's hockey game. Well maybe it wouldn't be that much,
but if you get a chance, go watch some girls compete.

Winter is right around the corner now and that means ski-
ing for many. There are two major ski areas around these
parts. Bryce Mountain and the Homestead offer decent skiing
at ridiculous prices. The Homestead is a nice place to visit but
is strictly a beginners slope. Like the golf courses, it is terribly
easy and offers little challenge. But it’s a great place to take a
date, a couple of bottles of wine and some French bread.

The more serious skier should go to Bryce Mountain, north
of Harrisonburg. Though small, it offers very good skiing for
these parts. Prices however are ridiculous, The only reason
able time to go is during the week when student rates becom:
at least $10. Well, it’s an expensive sport!

Goodnight Cur Ball; Please, Harry, go down the road!

Tufts gathered what composure
it had and began a drive with little
more than four minutes left in the
game. With the help of a question-
able pass interference call on W&L
on their own 28, Tufts went in to
score four yards out with 1:18 re-

Civilisation” Film Series
Set For 1971 Presentation

Dr. Allan Carlsson, president of
the Rockbridge Chapter of the Vir-
ginia Museum of Fine Arts has an-
nounced that the film series “Civili-
sation” has been obtained for show-
ing here.

“Civilisation” has met with criti-
cal praise and overflow audiences
wherever it has been shown. When
the National Gallery in Washington
premiered the series in this country,
“Gallery officials modestly hoped to
fill their 300 seat auditorium on
Sunday afternoon. The first after-
noon, 24,000 people showed up...”

Thus, though the films will not be
shown here until January, anyone in-
terested in seeing this excellent series
is urged to chaim their free tickets as
early as possible. This can be done
by contacting Dr. Allan Carlsson to
obtain a ticket request form.

 

At least 10 more volunteers are
needed to tutor in the Lexington
public schools. For particulars, see
either Professor Ray, Payne 32 B or
Professor Imeson in Howe 313.

price was a mere $5000. When the
board sought to contract him last
month for a January concert the
price was upped to $7500 and he
was booked up for January. Addi-
tional efforts were put forth by the
Board for a March concert, but be-
fore the contract for the tentative
date could be forwarded to him,
Taylor's fee rose to $11,000. With
only $14,000 in hand, and four con-
certs to go, the Board decided this
was too much. With only a limited
amount of space available at VMI
or Doremus, it was felt that the in-
creased number of ticket buyers
could not be accommodated.

NOTICE
Seniors planning to graduate in
June 1971 should complete an ap-
plication for degree before Novem-
ber 1. Application forms may be ob-
tained at the Registrar's Office. File
early — avoid the rush.

The Guess Who

7:30 P.M.

 

 

 

a
to North Vietnam.

Right now hundreds of Americans are
being held captive in North Vietnam.

A few prisoners have made it back. They
talk about bamboo cages. Vicious beatings.
Malnutrition. Humiliation.

But the North Vietnamese will tell us
nothing. And it’s this silence that makes our
appeal more urgent.

For the families at home, there is no
word on who’s alive. Who’s dead. Or even
who’s being held. There is nothing. Except
the anguish of not knowing.

Maybe you can —— this. By writing

tothe one man whocanc

ange it: The Presi-

dent of North Vietnam.

Ask him to release the names of prison-
ers, allow them to write to their families,
and let the Red Cross inspect the prisons to

 

insure proper medical treatment and living
conditions.
Remind him that he is bound by the

1949 Geneva Convention which his country

signed. And by the Istanbul resolution.

North Vietnamese leaders do care about
American public opinion. And if they think
they can gain something by bowing to it,
they will.

But one letter won’t do it. Or a thousand.
Maybe it will take millions. So we've got to
write now. All of us. And often.

Write a letter tonight. And send it to:
Office of the President, Democratic Repub-
lic of Vietnam, Hanoi, North Vietnam.

-—" cost youa quarter. But it might save
a life.
