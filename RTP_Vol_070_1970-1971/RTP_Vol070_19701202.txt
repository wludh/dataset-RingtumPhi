Washington and Lee’s Student
Body Executive Committee discuss-
ed the formation of a new joint
student-faculty University Council
and stressed procedural aspects of
the new independent exam schedule
during the course of its meetings on
November 23 and November 30.

Representatives of the Faculty and
Student Body Executive Committees
have been meeting for the past six
weeks on the University Council
question. The plan calls for further
involvement of the students in the
University governmental processes.

The joint proposal calls for the
formation of a council consisting of
12 students, 12 faculty members, the
President of the University, the
Dean of the College, the Dean of
the Law School, the Dean of Com-
merce, Economics, and Politics, the
Dean of Students, and the Presi-
dent of the Student Body.

According to plan, the council
would, as an advisory group, dis-
cuss and debate university business,
review and originate recommenda-
tions to the administration, faculty
and student government, serve as an
emergency forum for the exchange
of ideas on critical issues before the
University, and serve as the ultimate
authority over student affairs.

The proposed committee would
not have jurisdiction over the Honor
System or curricular affairs.

Plans call for monthly meetings
prior to faculty meetings, or at such
other times as requested by the
President of the University, the fac-
ulty, or a majority of Council mem-
bers. The council would have the

Mary Baldwin Choir And

power to initiate new proposals for
study by administration, faculty or
student government, serve as an
agent for both receiving reports
from and determining policy for the
Student Affairs Committee, and to
review the reports of faculty com-
mittees to the faculty as a whole,
making only recommendations on
the subject of the report.

At the EC meeting of November
23, the proposal passed earlier by
the Faculty EC was discussed, and
passed by a unanimous vote of 8-0.
Law representative Jim Slay and
freshman committeeman Robert
Johnson were absent.

The faculty will vote on the pro-
posal at its meeting on December 7,
if passed, the Council could be im-
plemented in mid-January and meet-
ings could begin in February.

In other actions prior to the
Thanksgiving recess, the EC for-
mulated plans for a teacher evalua-
tion survey to be led by the Uni-
versity Federation in March. Pre-
liminary plans call for individual
students to evaluate their professors
on a scale of 1 to 5 in 12 different
categories. Knowledge of material,
availability to students, and grading
practices are but a few of the cate-
gories being considered.

Vice President Thompson report-
ed on the results of a poll under-
taken by the sub-committee on the
honor system. 337 questionnaires
were returned. Although the opi-
nions of only one quarter of the
Student Body were evaluated, pre-
liminary trends seem to favor tight-
er delineation of the code, continua-

Glee Club Give Concert

On Sunday, Decenrvber 6, 1970,
The Choir of Mary Baldwin College
and the Washington and Lee Glee
Club will present an evening of
choral music in Lee Chapel. The
hour is 8 o'clock.

This marks the first of several con-
certs planned between these two
groups. There have been, and will
be, regular rehearsals together, so
that the performances can be more
finished events than is ordinarily
possible with one rehearsal on the
day of performance.

The mixed chorus will sing Part
| of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana.
Gordon Page, director of the Mary
Baldwin Choir, will conduct. The
piano duet accompaniment will be
provided by J. T. Cook, director of
the WAL Glee Club, and Richard
Webb, regular accompanist of the
Glee Club.

The Carmina Burana (Songs from
Beurén) are a group of Goliard
songs discovered in the Bavarian
monastery at Benedictbeuren. Dat-
ing from the 13th century, these

 

Luce.

poems celebrate the bohemian char-
acter of the lives developed by these
wandering “dropouts” of the Middle
Ages. Orff has collected a number
of these poems into a cantata, realiz-
ing their directness in fresh, vigorous
musical texture.

Notice

Philip Cho, tenor, will sing at the
second concert of the Rockbridge
Concert Theater Series tonight a:
Jackson Memorial Hall, VMI, at
8:15 p.m.

His program includes songs by
Handel, Beethoven, Strauss, Dupare,
Vaughan Williams, Frank Bridge,
and several Korean folk songs, and
he will sing arias from Mozart's
“Don Giovanni” and Puccini's “La
Boheme.”

Student memberships for the
Series are still available at the Book-
store for $7. Two concerts in the
Series still remain: the Preservation
Hall Jazz Band on Feb. 18 and th:
New York Pro Musica on April 26.

 

Leonard Wecinglass, lawyer for the Chicago Fight Trial, will debate Vir.

tion of the closed trial system, and
retention of the absolute penalty.

Thompson urged that the EC dis-
cuss the results of the poll and that
the Honor System must change with
public opinion of a given student
generation serving as a basis.

Bruce Madison was appointed as
the first student representative to
the Committee on Courses and De-
grees, during an Executive Sess :.

At the November 30 meeting the
EC heard a report from Henry Har-
key, Chairman of the Financial Re-
lations Committee. Harkey reported
a 200% increase in the number and
size of bad checks over a compar-
able time last year. The EC remind-
ed the Student Body as a whole that
cashing is a privilege and that stu-
dents should be more careful in the
cashing of checks.

Clarifications were made on pro-
cedures for the independent exam
schedule. Each department will have
a distribution point where exams

U G
IN JOINT

On University Council

BY JOE TOMPKINS

There is a proposal now pending
which will be considered by the fac-
ulty at its meeting next Monday.
The proposal has been approved by
a unanimous vote of both the Fac-
ulty Executive Committee and the
Student Executive Commitice.

A University Council—twelve stu-
dents, twelve faculty members, four
deans, and the Presidents of the
University and the student body—is
what is being proposed, and | can
say with little hesitation that if this
Council comes into being, it will be
the most important thing that has
been accomplished during my four
years here, and one of the most
significant events in the history of
this university.

As I see it, the establishment of
this Council would be one more step
in the direction of making Washing-
ton and Lee a real learning com-
munity—a very significant step, al-
though by no means the ultimate
one. In essence, what this proposal
indicates is the mutual willingness of
students, faculty, and administra-
tors to meet as a group, to listen to
one another, to reason together—
actions which, it seems to me, can
have nothing other than beneficial
results.

There is a degree of uncertainty in
moving to create a University Coun-
cil, for there is no past or present-
day model we can observe. Hypothe-
tical questions concerning the opera-
tion of the Council have been and
should be raised. Some can be an-
swered with assuredness, bul many
call for prognostication and specula-
tion, making clear-out answers im-
possible. | have been with this pro-
posal since its beginning, I under-
stand its purpose, and I have a clear
sense of its potential. Yet I can of-
fer no promises. I can only siate
what I believe to be true.

I believe that a University Coun-
cil as proposed is both desirable and
feasible. | believe that students, fac-
ulty, and administrators can meet
and discuss frankly the issues which
concern the universily community
I think such a growp can be repre-
sentative of the different elements of
the community and make decisions
which are in the best interests of the
community

Whether or not the University
Couneil would have any real pewer
is Not the most important thing in
my mind. I hope and believe that the
Council would gain the respeci of
the members of the commufily as a
responsive, responsible body, so that
it would retain a power of persua

sion in the conduct of university
business
However, whal concerns me the

i Un
versity Council coukd have on the
attitude of the menvbers of the Un
versity toward the decision-makins
process within the University. By
having student input, real input in
stead of incidenial participation, and
open imMleraction between students
amd faculty and administration. |
have no doubt that there would be

A Laudatory Philippic Upon University Council’s Potential

Mr. Joe Tompkins’ comments on the pro-
posed University Council in our “PinPoint”
column this week are perhaps the most idealis-
tically judicious assessment one could make
of the Council’s potential as a forum for dis-
cussion between students, faculty and admin-
istration.

“The Executive Committee of the Faculty
(by unanimous vote of the seven members
present) and the Executive Committee of the
Student Body recommend the establishment
of a University Council to consist of twelve
students, twelve faculty members, the Presi-
dent of the University, the Dean of the Col-
lege, the Dean of the Law School, the Dean
of the School of Commerce, Economics, and
Politics, the Dean of Students, and the Presi-
dent of the Student Body.

“The Council would

“(1) discuss and debate University
business providing an advisory
group representative of the Uni-
versity community ;
review and originate recommen-
dations to the administration, fa-
culty, and student government;
meet, in an emergency, as a for-
um for the exchange of ideas on
critical issues pending before the
community ; and
exercise ultimate authority and
supervision over student affairs.
The Council would possess jur-
isdiction over the honor system.

“To accomplish these ends the University
council would

“(1) meet regularly before each month-
ly faculty meeting and at such
other times as requested by the
President of the University, the
faculty, or a majority of the
Council members ;
initiate new proposals for study
by the administration, faculty, or
student government ;

“(3) function as the faculty at its meet-
ings now functions in receiving
reports from and determining pol-
icy for the SAC; and

review any faculty committee's
report to the faculty and, make
its own recommendations con-
cerning the subject of that report.
The Council could not amend or
veto the original report or in any
way delay the faculty's considera-
tion of it.

(The text of this proposal was altered
somewhat by the Faculty Executive Commit-
tee Monday night in a meeting which occur-
red after an assembly of the Faculty Discus-
sion Club, The substance of the proposal is in
no way altered ; the changes made in the text
were solely for the sake of clarity.)

Sait

The hopes which Mr, Tompkins expresses
in his “PinPoint” column are ours, idealisti-
cally. We see the potential value of such a

“(4)

“(2)

“(4)

University Council to be that it has no power
except over student affairs. Thus it remains
above the final political considerations of a
particular question and free to promote an
exchange of ideas between the three most 1m-
portant segments of the community.

So much for idealism. There are a few
murky realities which darken our rose-color-
ed glasses. Take for instance the fact that no
demand came from the student body as a
whole that a University Council such as the
one proposed above be established.

The possibility for student “input,” as Mr.
Tompkins terms it, is present in the proposed
University Council. But we wonder how
many students will become truly involved in
the future of the University by the mere crea-
tion of a Council. We can almost readily ima-
gine the following scene in the environs of
the colonnade as this newspaper is read this
afternoon :

Student A: Hmm. Did you read about this
University Council thing in the paper?

Student B: What paper?

A: The newspaper.

B: Oh, Where is it?

A: What?

B: The council or whatever you said. At
Yale?

A: Yale? No, here.

B: W&L made The Washington Post?

A: No, The Ring-tum Phi.

B: Oh. Well, what's so great about that?

A: Who said it was so great? We always
are in the Phi.

B: No, no, no. This committee you were
just talking about.

A: The coalition?

B: Don’t ask me—you were the one that
started it!

A: Started what?

B: The whole argument about the caucus.

A: What caucus?

B: You know, that . . . convocation.

A: Oh, you mean the convention.

B: I suppose.

A: Well...
about it?

B: I don’t know anything about it. You're
the one who knows about it.

A: O.K., O.K! First of all, it’s in 1972

B: The convention?

A: The convention. It’s called a “mock”
convention because it’s supposed to be fake.

B: Do you believe everything you read?
In the paper?

A: Well, yes...

B: Do you realize they already had the
fake council in 1968? I was there.

A: Well, then—why did you bring all this
up to begin with?

what do you want to know

B: I don’t know, but did you see where the
Redskins blew another one?

Perhaps we have been pragmatically judi
cious to the extreme. Yet we cannot ignore
the possibility that in hoping to bring the
blinding light of communication to an other
wise silent student community, many men at
W&L will become discouraged when the best
they can possibly aspire to arouse is a flicker
in the darkness.

A Mathematics Lesson From Mr. Harkey & Co.

It would seem that the faculty was appar-
ently too hasty in instituting the new curri-
culum for this year—at least in one respect.
They had not foreseen the need for a required
course in money management with special
emphasis upon “checkbook balancing for the
college student,”

Mr. Henry Harkey, chairman of the Cold
Check Committee, was not being an alarm-
ist when he reported to the Executive Com-
mittee Monday evening that the Cold Check
Committee had handled approximately a
200% increase from last year in the number
and amount of bad checks during the first ten
weeks of the school year, The cold checks
have bounced their way into Mr, Harkey’s
and his committee's hands at the average rate
of $50 a week. And the major reason for these
returned checks is “insufficient funds,” ac-
cording to Mr. Harkey.

Perhaps “inability to substract two from
would be a better term for it

two” Is there

something in the air around Lexington thi

year that creates a drowsiness when one be-
gins to substract the amount of a $15 check
from one’s previous balance of $2.50?
Whatever the reasons for the $485 in bad
checks which have had to be covered this
year, we, along with Mr, Harkey and the Exe-
cutive Committee, remind each student that
every bad check that is written in Lexington
further endangers the check cashing privi
leves of the entire student body. The purpose
of the Cold Check Committee is not to rescue
students from their own financial mishaps so
much as it is to insure the merchants of Lex
ington that the checks a student writes are
payable to the bearer on demand immedi
not one week later.
The committee can perform this function

ately

only if the students exercise their powers of
mathematics and judgment. If they choose to
do so (as the 49 students in the past ten week

the EC
changing that committee's name to the mor:

have done}, then should considet

(Editor's Note: “1 on 1” begins this week as a forum for the expression of
diverse opinion on issues which The Ring-tum Phi considers to be of interest
to the University. In the left hand column below appears the “pro” view-
point opposite the “con” opinion on the right. We invite your interest and
participation in order that “1 on 1° may be an effective forum for the ex-
pression of varied viewpoints within the University.)

BY HAP STEIN

Phe question of relevance is fac-
ing almost every facet of society to-
day. The universities and their in-
stitutions are no exception,

The questioning of relevancy has
even reached the most time-honored
institution here at Washington and
Lee: the Honor System. The ques-
tions being raised are sincere, well-
intentioned, and to the point. The
“Honor System Questionnaire”
which was circulated around school
several weeks ago brought out these
questions: What is the jurisdiction
of the honor system? Are the present
procedures viable? What penalty is
best fitted to the University
and to the accused? Is the existence
of the honor system at Washingion
and Lee necessary to the University?

The Honor System at Washington
and Lee University is based on one
principle: “A man shall conduct
himself as a gentleman.” This pre-
mise at first seems very ambiguous.
However, is not “honor” itself an
ambiguous word? Might not what
was considered dishonorable 100
years ago be thought of in different
terms today?

The Honor System takes this inio
accoum, by being “administered and
concerned solely with those offenses
which are considered as dishonor-
able by the siudent generation in-
volved.” Thus it can only be codified
to the extent that lying, cheating,
stealing are breaches of it. However,
these infringements are so opposed
to basic, moral ethics that under no
circumstances can they be condoned,
regardless of place or time.

For an Honor System to be rele
vant, “honor” must be a part of the
individual at all times. The Univer-
sity must do everything it can to en
courage this, and the Honor System
must apply at all times and places to
a student of Washingion and Lee

True, “honor” cannot be forced
on anyone, nor should it be achiev-
ed negatively, but since lying, steal
ing and cheating are so contrary to
basic moral ethics, the Universily
cannot overlook a dishonorable act
by any of its members, at any ime
or any geographical location while
the student is enrolled in Washing
ton and Lee.

The question of what the policy
should be in more detailed matters

such as homework, cold tests and
other matier involves the profes
sors’ right to set a policy. Since

homework and tests are considered
by many professors to be part of
the learning process, and the school
has given the instruction of that pro
cess to the professor, they obviously
shoul! have their own rules on tests
and homework. Any
these which involves
stealing or cheating is a dishonorable

The Honor System should be
changed. There is a good possibility
that in fact the Honor System has al-
ready changed. The Honor System
exists through the jurisdiction of the
students and therefore the students
call the shots as to what is dishonor-
able of what is honorable. There-
fore, the prevelant attitudes of the
students will dictate the de facto
guidelines of the Honor System, not
what is set out in the handbook.
This is a hard thing to recognize,
for anyone.

I think that everyone feels tha!
the idea of honor is a good thing.
However, does the idea of honor
necessarily dictate a certain set of
rules and regulations that are sac-
rosanct over any other set of rules
or over no rules? It is my belief that
the Honor System does need to be
changed. It has to be changed be-
cause it is, by its very nature, as set
up now, an inhibitive factor in the
learning process.

As the Honor System now stands
honor may be upheld but is learning
aided by the Honor System? In
many ways I think not. For instance,
if a student has a paper to do, by the
set of rules now enforced he cannot
talk with anyone about the paper
because he may inadverntently learn
something about the subject of his
paper which he otherwise would not
have known and if he put that in his
paper the student to whom he talked
is duty bound to turn him in on an
honor violation. Is that a violation
of the idea of honor? Is that student
dishonorable and should he be “ask-
ed to leave"? One of the primary
reasons for the university is the fact
that it provides an open forum for a
dialectical learning process, It seems
that the Honor system stands in the
way of this ideal and because of this
the Honor System should be chang-
ed.

lt goes without saying that if the
Honor System is changed every at-
tention should be given to the fact
that the Honor System should in-

All independent exams are “hot” un-
til the end of the exam period.

A statement of policy limiting the
use of the Cockpit and placing its
use under the control of the Uni-
versity Center-Assimilation Com-
mittee is made.

The Honor System Study is initiated.

A $40 allocation is made for the

The Curriculum Committee is di-

course review.

Applications are sought for the stu-
dent position on the Committee
on Courses and Degrees.

Nov. 30

The possibility of a
Council is advanced.
The above constitutes a brief,

thumbnail sketch of what the Execu-

tive Committee of the student body
has accomplished during the firs!
third of its nine-month life this year.

Many of the actions (such as the
report given before the EC that
Fancy Dress had been cancelled, the
delegation of the Legal Aid and Re-
search Committee of the Law School
to study the city’s new license plates,
and so on) have been greeted with
hoots and shouts and controversy
throughout the campus. Others, such
as the projected course review and
the establishment of a “court of last
resort” for students wishing to chal
lenge the ruling of the newly-renam-
ed Student Financial Relations Com
mittee, were scarcely the cause of
school-stopping demonstrations or
mournful tollings from Washington
Hall. Most of them, in fact, like the
vast majority of the EC's weekly,
routine, “housekeeping” proposals
and appropriations, receive no atten-
tion at all,

Moments of drama and periods of
crisis have, it is true, been rare this
semester in the EC's work. Indeed,
one could say that the $40 alloca-
tion for the newsletter and the initia
tion of the Honor System study were
accomplished with almost identical
airs of businesslike efficiency, and
with a minimum of fanfare.

It is, perhaps, too early to ascer-
tain the impact of the proposed Uni

Envelopes Required By Friday

This year each W&L student will
determine the sequence of his final
exams by himself. Rules and regula-
tions for the examinations can be
found in the University catalogue.

The exam schedule for the Fall
term will be as follows: Dec. 12, 14,
15, and 16 from 9:00 a.m. to noon
and from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. and
from 9:00 asm. to noon on Dec. 17.

A student will schedule his exami-
nations according to the following
procedure: this week he will obtain
from the registrar’s office a special
examination envelope for each of
his classes and a schedule form, He
will prepare a schedule of this exam-
inations (on the form provided),
supply the information requested at
the top of each envelope and give
the examination envelope to the ap
propriate instructor at the first class
meeting of the last week of sched-
uled classes.

Failure to register prior to the ex-
amination period jprevents a student
from taking an examination.

The student may change his sche-
dule only through petition to the
Executive Committee of the faculty.
Any student late for an examination
will not receive time beyond the an-
nounced termination of the schedul-
ed period.

Each examination will be token
in a room or rooms designated ‘by
the department concerned. At the
end of the period the student will re-
turn both the exam and answers to
the department concerned.

Some courses require that the en-
tire class be present for the examira-
tion. Those courses and the periods
they will meet are as follows:

A student who fails to take any
final examination shall receive a
grade of F in the course unless he is
exoused for reasons deemed suffici-
ent by the appropriate dean and the
instructor concerned. If he is ex-
cused he shall receive grade I.

No instructor is at liberty to an-
nounce the result of any final exani-
ination until the end of the examira-
tion period except in the case of a
senior in his graduating term whe
may be given his grades when he
has completed his last examination.

In any instance in which the ex-
amination procedure is unclear, it is
regarded to ‘be the student’s respon-
sibility to contact the registrar's of-
fice for information.

Sea & The East Utopian Mission
Will Rock The Lyric, Lexington

BY TOM MAYS

The room is small, with log walls
and exposed beams, all of it filled,
jammed with musical equipment.

Amplifiers, microphones, an elec-
tric organ, guitars and drums—a
single lamp with a bare bulb.

Sea steps up to the microphone in
the center of the room, mumbles
something about “Majesty,” gives a
cue and the music begins.

Incredibly loud at close range,
the music swirls, vibrates the floor-
boards, crashes about the room, en-
guifs everything with sound,

The drums throb. Hair streaming
Sea reaches for a note, his voice
slightly raspy, his face intense.

The mood...

I can see...
You're much too free...

I must find a way to reach you
But we're two worlds apart...

In addition to being the lead singer,
he is also the composer and the lyri-
cist for the group, Sea and the East
Utopian Mission, which rents a rus-
tic farm near Fredericksburg, Va.

The group has been together for
about two years. Last year they
toured Florida where they appeared
at the Miami Pop Festival. Across
the country, they played in concert
with such well-known groups as Big
Brother and the Holding Co., Pogo
and the Guess Who.

This past fall the band played the
college circuit in Virginia, Washing-
ton and Maryland. They are current-
ly putting in five, six and seven hours
a day practicing, writing, and re-
writing the songs they will do as
they cross the country to California.

The Ring-tum Phi Rivals

Penelope Ashe Style

To the Editors of The Ring-tum Phi:

The tenth
year’s Ring-tum Phi now lies in
front of me, reread twice.

The only thing notable about the
issue seems to be the fact that it is
a carbon copy of ithe nine issues pre-
ceding it, a feat of journalistic skill
which rivals the collective Penelope
Ashe in creative ability.

My comments are not to be con-
strued as simply non-constructive
criticism, but, rather, they should be
viewed as one reader’s effort to
show to those concerned that which
does not appeal to him:

1). You seem to make a pointed
effort to perpetuate the never-end-
ing and childish feud ‘between Alan

lof 2 Earphones
Are Returned

BY GARY POLIAKOFF

One of the two sets of Koss stereo
earphones taken from the Anderson
Music Room in McCormick Library
has been returned. The other is still
as yet unretrieved.

Professor Robert Stewart offered
a reward in the last issue of the
Ring-tum Phi for information con-
cerning the earphones. A few days
ago two students found one of the
sets and returned it to the Music
Room. The earphones are valued 1
$29 a pair.

Professor Stewart said, “We oper-
ate the Music Room in an informal
way. I was a little surprised when
two of the earphones disappeared. I
am thankful that we were able to
retrieve one pair.”

obviously pleases the three men
mentioned, (no doubt they like the
idea of having their names in print
each issue), I can't see where it
would interest any body else.

2). You do an admirable job in
reporting the events and formal hap-
penings around campus, but, remem-
ber, Washington and Lee is not some
‘huge auditorium in which these
events take place at an impersonal
distance. The Ring-tum Phi is over-
looking its greatest possible source
of news—the students themselves—
human beings with feelings, ideas,
dislikes, preferences. A little more
personal reporting might brighten
up your dull collage of news trivia.

Enough said. Perhaps your other
readers would like to comment.

A Brand X Article
By A Brand X Writer

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:
Bob LaRue’s Brand X article was
one of the worst collections of bull
I have ever read. It consists of
cheap, bush, unfounded, demeaning
charges against a group of profes-
sional athletes who for the most
have made substantial, positive con-
tributions to their teams’ perform-
ances. Aside from the content, the
article is technically lousy: at least
six names are misspelled. If this
team ever needs a brand x sports-
writer to cover it, LaRue’s the one.

versity Council mentioned elsewhere
in this week’s The Ring-tum Phi.
However, it is not too early to at-
tempt a categorization of the 1970-
71 Executive Committee as one for
whom the business of examination,
revision, and change holds no hid-
den terrors, but also one for whom
that business is not the occasion for
bullhorns, bands, or fireworks.

Should all of the alterations in
the mental and physical environment
known as Washington and Lee
which the EC has contemplated or
is now contemplating come to pass,
it is, almost certainly, a foregone
conclusion that life on the W&L
campus will be a different proposi-
tion than it has been in the past. It is
not the purpose of this examination
to consider the relative good or evil
in such a change, but rather to ob-
serve the skill and efficiency, or lack
of them, with which the change is
being effected.

Some changes have been made al-
ready. Many others, it is safe to as-
sume, remain to be made. Many of
the minor tasks confronting the EC
now are simply finishing touches on
major changes of a semester, a year,
or two years ago. One by one, two
by two, and in great, thundering
hordes the old concepts of in loco
parentis, student dependency, and,
occasionally, student apathy are be-
ing brought before the systematic
scrutiny of the Executive Committee
and are subjected to a gradual war
of attrition.

Ruggers Field
Twelfth Place

In Tournament

Playing in the Washington Invi-
tational Sevens Tournament _ this
weekend, the Washington and Lee
Rugby team made its best showing
of the season. In a field of forty-
five teams from the U.S. and Can-
ada, W&L drew Louisville Univer-
sity as its first opponent. In a game
that cannot be rated as a contest, the
team swept into the division quar-
ter-finals to meei the Richmond A
Rugby Club. Scores by Chris Mur-
ray and Charlie Brown with extra
points by Fred Fletcher enabled
W&L to walk away from their op-
ponent by a score of 15-6.

Having worked their way to the
semi-finals, the Generals were paired
against the Ottawa Rugby Club, Na-
tional Canadian Champions.

Playing on the Lincoln Memoria!
Mall, in the shadow of the Washing-
ton Monument, the ruggers fell 23-0
in a contest that was a classic in
frustration. Completely outclassed,
the Generals never said die Ottawa
went on to the finals only to lose to
Georgetown University 10-3.

and this week clearly indicates it. The Rams
dumped the Forty-Niners, the Jets blasted

sticking his foot out to halt an apparent
touchdown run. After it was all over, no less
than five teammates said that they had plann-
ed to do the same thing, and the coach was
noted for saying that he taught his players
to think clean and play dirty. I'd hate to think

W&L Dunks Randolph-M

BY PALMER TRICE

Last night, for the first time since
the 1961-62 season, the Washington
and Lee Generals grabbed a basket-
ball victory over the Randolph-Ma-
con Yellow Jackets, 53-46. The sea-
son’s opener did much to show that
the Generals are not coming, they
are here. Before what sounded like
15,000 screaming fans, both teams
opened slowly. After about four min-
utes, the score was but 3-1. One had
memories of such inspiring games
as the North Carolina State-Duke
game of several years ago. Heavily
favored Duke ended up losing 12-10.

Both teams, which were getting
but one shot at the basket, began to
hit. Led by Paul McClure’s 9 points.
the Generals led at the half, 24-18.
Coach Canfield’s Corns employed
several defenses, one of them being
a very tight man for man.

The second half found both teams
more effective on offense. W&L
mair.tained its lead, Offensively, they
were led by Captain Mike Daniel,
who ended the game with 16 points
and 13 rebounds. Broken-nosed
Ellie Gutshall sparked the Generals
1-3-1 zone. His traps rattled the
Yellow Jackets, who shot a mere
27% from the floor.

Randolph-Macon was led by sen-

Grapplers Pin Guilford College

Bard Wrisley, a 177 pounder who
was eight pounds overweight 12
hours before the match, sweated
down to become the hero of W&L’s
season opener with Guilford Col-
lege. With the wrestlers down 14-12
in a see-saw battle through 167,
Wrisley drew first points as he gain-
ed a takedown in the opening period.
This was nullified, however, by his
opponents’ reversal and the period
ended tied.

The dramatic point ocourred with
15 seconds left in the second period
when Wrisley caught his man off-
balance and pinned him to put W&L
ahead 17-14.

Captain Dee Copenhaver follow-
ed with a victory in a tight battle
that saw him come from behind in
the second period and ride his Guil-

ford man out for a 5-0 win. This
salted the match away, but the final
insult was added when heavyweight
Jim Hooker strolled to the mat, took
down his opponent and pinned him
in the first minute of the contest.

In the lower weights Pat Buford
got the seasons first points as he
drew with his 118 pound opponent.
Buford’s match was notable for his
remarkable comeback in the third
period after being behind 5-1. At
126 pounds Bruce Hyatt fell 6-0 in
a tough contest that was marked by
Hyatt’s inability to escape from his
Opponent.

The highlight of the lower weights,
however, was provided by Craig
Hankins, a fine 134 pounder, who
took his Opponent down and pinned

him with a bridging cradle after one

===

minute and 17 seconds. Bill West
received a forfeit at 142 and at 150
pounds Bill Melton ran into some
stiff competition from a fine Guil-
ford opponent. Melton fell victim
12-2 as did Jim Steiff at 158 pounds
by a margin of 13-3 and Jack Ross
at 167 8-1.

The Generals travel to Dickinson,
a Pennsylvania wrestling stronghold,
on Saturday and host the Blue De-
vils of Duke here Tuesday at 7:30
p.m.

According to the coaches, if the
team can improve at the middle
weights and continue to win at the

ior Dale Kurowsky’s 11 points, The
Yellow Jackets could not come up
with the big play. They could find
no one to take control, and beat the
General's defense. Although Coa-h
Webb’s roundballers outscored the
home team from the floor, they con-
verted only 12 of 25 free throw at-
tempts.

Due to last minute attempts by
the Yellow Jackets to get the ball,
the Blue and White took 37 gift
shots, and made 21 of them, many
in the final seconds. The Generals
shot about 33% from the field.
Neither team looked extremely
strong. Coach Canfield, while pleas-
ed with the win, admitted that his
boys “looked ragged.” He said that
the team showed poise. Their dedi-
cation to the game showed on the
court.

Look for some changes in offense,
with more movement on the court.
The shooting as a whole should, and
will improve. Mindful that “we
could have broken the game open
from the foul line,” the free throw
percentage should rise. The polish
of a winning team should come with
time.

Thursday, the Generals play
Bridgewater at beautiful downtown
Doremus. Let’s be there.

The 6 o'clock prelude to the var-
sity classic almost stole the show.

say the least, fantastic. The final

score, 85-75, was due mostly to ex-
cellent teamwork. The J.V. B-ballers
looked as if they had played together
for several seasons. Matt Montgo-
mery led the scoring with 21 points.
Others in double figures were Geoff
Nolan, Jerry Porath, Craig Smith,
and Phifer Helms. The Generals
consistently broke the Yellow Jacket
press, hitting on many easy snow
birds.

Sea used to call his music, “acid
blues,” but he dropped that descrip-
tive title as the group’s repertoire has
expanded.

They now play hard rock, blues,
and country and western in a unique
combination of different styles.

This Saturday night the band will
appear at the Lyric Cinema at 11:00
p.m. On Sunday the group will play
in concert at 1:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m.
in the afternoon. See the Lyric

Mahaffey’s career totals are 127
catches for 1,449 yards and eight
touchdowns, a new school record by
a big margin.

Carter, who already holds the all-
time record for number of punts (he
punted the ball 90 times in nine
games in 1968), easily set a new
national career record in the same
category. In his three years, Carter
punted the ball 222 times for 7,716
yards. The old record was a mere
197 punts for 7,148 yards set by
Kevin McClelland of Arkansas State
in 1966-68.

the Executive Committee Room of
the Student Center. Members of the
University community are cordially
invited to view the seven contempor-
ary paintings, which will be in Lex-
ington until January.

Norman Annis’ “Dead Crow” a
charcoal work, contrasts the two en-
tities of beauty and death. Annis is
an American artist currently teach-
ing at Gettysburg College.

Marcelo Bonevardi, a native Ar-
gentine now living in New York
City, combines a sense of mysticism
with the mixed media of painting,
architecture, and sculpture in his
“Moon Guardian.”

Harvey Breverman, who teach2s
at the State University of New Yort:
at Buffalo, is the creator of “Figure
with Tallis.” an intaglio print. Bre-
verman employs a high degree of
technical knowledge with a keea
sense of craftsmanship in placing a
human image halfway between real-
ity and dream.

Eduardo Mac Entyre, another Ar-
gentine, employs contrasting shapes
and colors to manifest a form of op
art in “Pintura Generativa Transpar-
ancias.”

Lowell Nesbitt, born in Baltimore,
bu tcurrently a New York resident,
uses his work, “IBM 1418” to an-
swer the question “What is real-
ity?” His is a wholly modern ende»-
vor in pencil and etching, attempting
to place detail at an absolute mini-
mum,

Gabor Peterdi, a native of Hun-
gary now teaching at Yale, is the
engraver of “Winter,” which al-
tempts to deal with both landscape
and the image of man.

Rogelio Polesello’s “Variation N>
8” is an avant-garde effort, formu-
lated in part by spray-on paint and
stencils.

of respect, trust, and commitment to
learning which have always existed
on this campus. The vitality and
strength of the University depends
on these feelings.

I believe these things can happen.
And if any one thing confirms my
belief, it is the work which has tak-
en place during the past two months
between the Faculty Executive Com-
mittee and the Student Executive
Committee. There was disagreement
and variance of opinion, but there
was also honesty and frankness, fe-
sulting in substantial output.

University. A University Council is
a step in the right direction.

ple will cheer about the great end-
ing, but who can get excited about
a couple of teams who together won
only two games before last Satur-
day's meeting.

If Southern Cal had not played

ABC would have suffered a serieous

or Georgia-Georgia Tech would
have been much better FV choices.
I'm hoping that next year the AK

not worth national television,

1 On 1: The Honor System

Olson

(Continued from Page 2)

clude an amending clause so that
the Honor System can be changed
when social conditions call for it.
The Honor System committee
should make every effort to make
the Honor System fit current stu-
dent attitudes about honor. It
strikes me as disastorous that in its
recent poll the Honor System study
committee did not include a section
about the idea of honor. The pol!
dealt with particulars, not attitudes
and I don’t think that they got a
good idea of the current feelings
about honor. They go some indica-
tion of the current feelings about the
Honor System but not about honor.

It is apparent that a concept like
honor is something that will change
with different social and political
conditions. I think that this genera-
tion of students has a different con-
cept of what honor is (and should be)
from the previous one, Therefore,
since the Honor System seems to
exist for the students it should ut
least try to parallel the feelings of
the students. It is inevitable that our
concept of honor be different from
our father’s because we have grown
up in an entirely different world.
Some will say that honor is static
and therefore should not be changed.
I don’t think that, particularly at this
time in history, anyone can say that
anything is static because everything
is changing.

The Honor System is a difficult
thing to change. I am not even sure
how it should be changed but we
are at least looking at it which is
necessary. We have got to see if we
can make the Honor System coin-
cide with a contemporary concept
of honor. We must also make the
Honor System something that is
helpful to the learning process, and
not an unwieldy giant.

outside pressure as possible. A clos-
ed trial provides those conditions.

When a student has ‘been convicted
of an honor violation, there is no
doubt that he must be (punished.
This punishment must be in such a
form as to best help the accused and
the university, Although our experi-
ence with our present jail system
tells us that severe punishment is
seldom profitable for the convicted
or society as a whole, the University
has no room for lying, cheating or
stealing.

When a person has been asked to
withdraw, the University does itself
no harm by withholding the exact
nature of the withdrawal. Washing-
ton and Lee must, however, be fair
to other universities, and a statement
to the effect that the student con-
ducted himself in a manner unbe-
coming a W&L student would be
fairest to another university and the
convicted student,

Hence, two conclusions can be
drawn. First, honor is definitely
needed in our age of polarization,
rapid change and revolution. Second,
although dishonorable acts can

never be changed, the answers sur-

rounding the makeup of the Honor
System are not all black and white.
Change can be helpful, but only
when it helps to promote “honor.”
