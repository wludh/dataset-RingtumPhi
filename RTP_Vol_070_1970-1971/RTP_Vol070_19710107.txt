Chairman, Contact ’71

CONTACT ‘71 is coming next
week, The men speaking here have
been chosen not for their name nor
totally for their views. Rather they
have been chosen for their thoughts
and their ability to communicate
these ideas. They are men well read
and well learned in this year’s topic,
“The Crisis in Higher Education.”

They have had intimate contact
with universities and their problems.
Each will address himself to a separ-
ate crisis in education, from student
values to student unrest to black
education.

Two speakers should especially in-
terest the university community. Dr.
K. Ross Toole, author of “The Ty-
ranny of Spoiled Brats,” has been
voted the best professor for the past
seven years at the University of Mon-
tana. Although highly opposed to
student revolutionaries, he was
equally opposed to the interven-
tion in Cambodia. And during the
crisis at Montana last spring, he was
exempted by name from amy criii-
cism in a report issued by the stu-
dents—this in spite of his article at-
tacking student revolutionaries. H2
should be a tremendous speaker.

The other speaker is Dr. Arthur
G. Hensen, President of Georgia
Tech. He has some very dynami-
views on curriculum. He also has
some excellent ideas on ways stu-
dents can change the world. A young
president, he was elevated to the
position over three vice-presidents
at Georgia Tech and one from M.1.F.

This is not to say the other speak-
ers are not equally as good—they
are. Space permits discussion in this
column of only two.

“Contact” is more than speakers
this year. Its topic concerns the vital
existence of this university as well a;
others. Time is allowed for discus-
sion of the serious problems con-
fronting us.

The Committee has set aside three
“off” days during “Contact” in which
no speakers have been scheduled.
By leaving these three days open, the
Committee hopes that other student
groups and professors will take time
to analyze the issues presented dur-
ing “Contact” week. It is our hope
that these speakers will excite and
generate much thought and discus-
sion for weeks to come.

The men speaking here should e>-
cite such discussion, It is the hope
of the Committee that the university
community will mot let the discus-
sion die—citehr during CONTACT
‘71 or after its conchusion.

Contact Week

 

Toole and Hatfield Are
Symposium’s Speakers

Washington and Lee’s CONTACT
‘71 speaking symposium will begin
next Monday night with a presenta-
tion ‘by Dr. K. Ross Toole, promi:
nent professor at the University of
Montana.

Other highlights of the initial week
are a debate between Philip Abbot
Luce, chairman of the college divi-
sion, Young Americans for Freedom,
and Leonard Weinglass, a counsel
for the “Chicago Bight,” and a
speech by Sen. Mark Hatfield, Re-
publican Senator from the State of
Oregon.

CONTACT is an annual sym-
posium sponsored jointly by the In-
ter-Fraternity Council and the Stu-
dent Body. Each year its discussions
focus on a particular theme.

In the past, themes have been
“The City,” “The Crumbling Estab-
lishment,” and “Power.” Prominent
speakers who have come to Wash-
ington and Lee under the program's
auspices include Tom Wicker, Sena-
tor George McGovern, Former At-
torney General Ramsey Clark, Sena
tor Barry Goldwater, and Pollster
Samuel Larbell.

The topic for this year's program,
chaired by senior Matt Cole, of
Newnan, Ga., is “Crisis in Higher
Education” Dr, Henry Steele Com
mager, noted historian from Am-
herst College was the symposium’s
first speaker last fall.

Dr. Toole, who will present “Some
Comments on Student Revolu-
tionaries in Lee Chapel Monday
night, is the author of a highly criti-
cal letter about radical students,
“The Tyranny of Spoiled Brats.”
This statement of position was ori-
ginally written to his brother and
was reprinted in U.S. News and
World Report and in the Reader's

Digest after being circulated widely
in the nation’s newspapers.

Dr. Toole is Hammond professor
of western and American history at
Montana. He has been a teacher,
editor, author and is considered a
liberal on many political questions.

He is also former director of the
City of New York Museum and
museum director for the state of
New Mexico, and wrote “Montana:
An Uncommon Land,” published in
1959,

In the middle 1950s, he was co-
editor of “Montana Opinion,” a
newspaper designed to carry the
news that was allegedly suppressed
by the established news media. One
of his colleagues in that venture
was Dr. Milton Colvin, now profes-
sor of political science at Washing-
ton and Lee.

Luce, who describes himself as a
“right wing libertarian,” will present
‘a seminar on the crisis in education
at 4 p.m. Tuesday. Weinglass will
speak on “legal implications of stu-
dent unrest” in Tucker Hall at the
game time. At 7 p.m. that night there
will be cocktail parties and recep-
tions for both men; Luce at Sigma
Nu, Weinglass at Pi Kappa Alpha.
The debate, centering on “Deca-
dence and Recovery in American
Education: Who is Responsible?”
will follow at 8 p.m.

Hatfield, one of the best-known
members of congress, will be honor-
ed at a cocktail party at Psi Upsilon
ind will speak at 8:15.

The Senator is himself an educa-
tor, and was associate professor of
political science and dean of stu-
dents at Williamette University,
Salem, Ore., until 1956,

He placed Richard Nixon's name
in nomination for the presidency at

 

Dr. K. Ross Toole

the 1960 Republican National Con-
vention, and served as keynote speak-
er and temporary chairman at the
GOP’s convention four years later.

He is a member of the Senator's
Interior and Space Sciences Com-
mittees and the Select Committee on
Small Business.

Sen. Hatfield holds the B.A. de-
gress from Williamette and a mas-
ter’s degree from Stanford Univer-
sity. He has been awarded 20 hon.
orary doctorates.

Speakers slated for the second
week of this year’s expanded CON-
TACT program, are Dr. Charles
Hamilton of Columbia University, a
co-author with Stokley Carmichael
of Black Power: Politics of Libera-
tion in America, and Arthur Hansen,
President of the Georgia Institute of
Technology.

Representative Philip Crane (R-
Hl.) and Dr. Harald Taylor, former
President of Sarah Lawrence Col-
lege, will participate in a joint dis-
cussion to bring out their conflict-
ing educational philosophies on Fri
day, January 22.

Faculty Approves Course Changes
For History, Languages and P.E.

The faculty in its regular meeting
Tuesday paved the way for the initia-
tion of several new courses and also
derived a procedure for the election
of the 12 faculty representatives for
the newly created University Coun-
oil.

Approval went to a few course on
the Middle Ages, to two advanced
courses in Italian, and to a re-design
of the physical education curriculum.

“The Middle Ages” will be offered
on alternate years when the course
on the Renaissance is not scheduled,
starting in the spring term of 1972.
Both courses are to be staffed by an
imterdepartmental faculty.

The new Italian courses are the
third and fourth in that language (o
be included in the undergraduate of-
ferings. They will be intermediate

W. D. McHenry

Now Designated
Athletic Director

Washington and Lee has named
alumnus William D. (Bill) McHenry
director of athletics and head of the
department of physical education.

McHenry (presently is athletic di-
rector, chainman of the department
of physical education and head foot-
ball and lacrosse coach at Lebanon
Valley College in Annville, Pa. He
plans to remain at Lebanon Valley
until June 1, when he will assume
his full-time duties at W&L.

The 38-year-old Swarthmore, Pa.
native is a 1954 graduate of W&L,
where he was an outstanding center
on the Generals’ football teams of
1951, °52, and '53, and was a star
lacrosse player. He captained the
1953 football team, the last to play
under the University's program of
subsidized athletics. The next year,
W&L abandoned athletic scholar-
ships in favor of the present nonsub-
sidized program.

University President Robert E. R.
Huntley announced McHenry’s ap-
pointment to succeed Eugene F.
(Gene) Corrigan, who resigned in
October to become director of uni-
versity athletic programs at the Uni-
versity of Virginia on Jan. 1.

No acting director will be named
at Washington and Lee, President
Huntley said. McHenry will make
frequent periodic visits to Lexington
‘to give direction to the athletic pro-
gram during the five-month interim
period, and Richard Miller, assistant
athletic director, will provide ad-
ministrative continuity.

“We are delighted that Bill Mc-
Henry will be our new athletic direc-
tor,” Huntley said. “His experience
as an athletic director of a highly
successful program at Lebanon Va!-
ley, the high regard his colleagues
in athletics feel for him, and his ea-
thusiasm for our approach to col'ege
sports all commended him to us.”

The president said McHenry’s se-
lection was the culmination of sev-
eral months of careful and deliberate
evaluation of a large number of
candidates for the position. “We
were fortunate to have such a strong
group of candidates for our athletic
directorship,” he added. “We were

able to make our choice from a posi-
tion of real strength.”

In his 10 years at Lebanon Valley,
McHenry has coached football teams
to a 44-34-1 overall record, won one
Middle Atlantic Conference cham-
pionship and tied for another. His
lacrosse program, begun in 1966, has
posted a 30-14 overall mark, wit)
one MAC championship.

McHenry previously coached at
Penn Military College and at Wil-
liams,

Still trim at 6-3 and 215 pounds,
McHenry looks like he could still
fit into his W&L football uniform
After ‘being named W&L’s outstand-
ing major sport athlete in his senior
year, McHenry played in two post-
season contests, the 1953 Blue-Gray
Game and the 1954 College All-Star
Game against the Detroit Lions.

He was a sixth round draft choice
of the Washington Redskins and
played two years of service football
at Ft. Jackson ,S. C. before entering
the coaching ranks,

McHenry coached football, swim-
ming and track and directed the in-
tramural program at Penn Military,
then spent three years as lacross«
coach and freshman football coach
at Williams, leaving there in 1961
for his present post at Lebanon Val-
ley.

Long active in lacrosse circles, Mc-
Henry initiated the sport at Lebanon
Valley in 1966. He is the current
presidem and former treasurer of
the U. S. Lacrosse Coaches Associa-
tion. In 1961 he coached the North
‘cam in the annual North-South
College All-Star Game. The head
coach for the South was his younger
brother Bob, also a W&L alumnus
and now head lacrosse coach at Yale.

McHenry has directed a sports
camp in Bridgewater, Va. for sev-
eral years and also conducted a la-
crosse camp in Pennsylvania’s Poco-
no Mountains.

He received a B.S. degree in com-
merce at Washington and Lee in
1954 and has a masters degree in
education from the University of
Pennsylvania.

duPont Features New Exhibit

An exhibition of landscapes by
Patricia. Matson Thomas, instruc-
tor in art at Hollins College, is cur-
rently being presented in duPoat
Gallery.

Mrs. Thomas’ style is hardly in
the picture-postcard tradition, says
Dr. Gerard Doyon, professor of art.

She selects isolated figures and ob-
jects on the landscape which she
finds to be especially interesting, and
rearranges them in new and novel
compositions.

Each motif is recognizable enough.

Swede Henberg, President of the Student Body 1969-76

Dr. Doyon says—a tree here, a cow
there, rocks scattered about—but not
always as they are seen in nature.
Sometimes they are whole, some-
times fragmented, and sometimes
only pieces or details are represented.
Perspective is occasionally revers-
ed in Mrs. Thomas’ works, and laws
of gravity are broken. The result, ac-
cording to Dr. Doyon, is a landscape
which leaves much to the imagina-
tion—paintings, litographs, etchings.
and drawings which appeal to the in-
teHligence as well as to the fancy.

Mrs. Thomas is a graduate of
Mount Holyoke College and holds
both the M.A. and M.F.A. degrees
from the University of lowa. She has
studied at the Rhode Island School
of Design and the University of
Massachusetts as well.

Her prize-winning works have
been exhibited widely in New Eng-
land and the midwest, and she has
been awarded a number of grant;
and fellowships.

The gallery is open to the public
without charge cach weekday,

Swede Henberg Selected

ties of manhood, truthfulness, and
courage, “moral force of character
and the instinet to lead, and physical
vigor, as evidence by fondness for
the success in sports

Henbere. who is from Laramie,
Wyoming. is currently a graduate

student at the University of Texas,
He was one of four individuals nomi-

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

January 7, 1971

The Dean’s List-Honor Roll Craze

When grades are mentioned in any conversation, the sub-
ject is bound to be sticky at best. Yet we can't help wondering
why it was that about 200 students made the Honor Roll and
around 400 managed Dean's List in this, the first fall term at
W&L. We are not questioning W&L students’ capability of
attaining such academic honors, but the significance of those
honors in view of the large numbers receiving recognition.

Perhaps the reason behind this unusually large number of
honored students is due to the reduced course load which ai-
fords the students with the opportunity to take four courses in-
stead of the traditional five. Though the time period is lessened
between the beginning and the end of the term this year, stu-
dents still attend the same amount of class meetings for
their courses as they did under the old two semester system.

Or perhaps this large number is a result of increasing dili-
gence among students. Or maybe it could be that with the
more stringent requirements gone, students are choosing
courses in which they feel they are assured better grades. And
then again, it might be that more professors are grading more
leniently.

Whatever the reason, the phenomena of about one-half of
the student body population making a 3.0 or better moves us
to reconsider the requirements for Dean’s List and Honor
Roll. Somehow, being recognized on the Dean's List or the
Honor Roll is less impressive an academic honor when a
student is included in a group of about 600. And the signifi-
cance of the academic achievement is consequently lessened.

We recommend that the grade point average for Dean's
List and Honor Roll be changed for the next term. Dean's
List requirement should be a 3.2 grade point average; Honor
Roll ought to be awarded for a 3.6.

If Dean's List and Honor Roll are to be distinctive acade-
mic honors, it appears that the present requirements shoula
be changed, or else the honors will continue to be in the future
less significant and more perfunctory,

The Dance Board is Pleased To...

The news offered by the members of the Dance Board (fea-
tured elsewhere on this page) that there will, indeed, be con-
certs and entertainment this year should come as welcome
news to all those who have paid their $40, and had begun to
give up hope, as well as to those who “didn’t get around to
buying a dance plan this year, but I really would like to go to
some of the concerts, etc., ete.”

That the number of students falling into the latter category
is larger this year than it has ever been is, we think, pretty
much of an open secret. That this development is in great mea-
sure responsible for the plight in which the dance board finds
itself is also generally understood. However, there are some
facts in this little matter which are not heard so often, nor,
possibly, so widely distributed, In order to present a clear pic-
ture of what the Dance Board is doing and why, it would be
best to give these latter considerations at least a cursory nod
of acquaintance,

To begin, then, the Dance Board has, by what Mr. Meem
has reported, done an impressive job, if not in capturing the
top names in the pop music field, at least in providing a little
something for almost every musical taste.

People are not going to come thundering down the roads to
Lexington from a radius of several hundred miles, but they
might come from several neighboring schools to see the con-
certs, and that is something. Nobody is going to ask Credence
to interrupt their busy schedule to come to Lexington, but
Poco will be here. James Taylor priced himself out of our
market, but his brother will be here, and again we submit that
the achievement is substantial.

The plan they have offered, two concerts on the weekend
of Feb. 5, the Poco concert Feb. 20, and the Sha-na-na concert
March 20, should be attractive to almost the entire student
body. However, as Mr. Meem explained in his letter, there is
a slight catch to it. It is this: no matter how much the student
body may be pleased and happy with the work turned in by
the Dance Board, no matter how good their intentions o fat-
tenidng most, some, or a few of the concerts might be, the law
of finances states that no body or organization can continue to
spend money indefinitely without having an income of some
sort, and escape some sort of serious mental, physical, or legal
trouble.

In short, if these concerts are not supported, the members
of the Washington and Lee student body can look forward to a
rather bleak and joyless short term, with musical interludes
provided only by the stereo, WREL, or humming softly to

oneself, MIC

Fancy Dress Dies Quietly

For the past 60 years ,the end of
January has meant two things here:
the end of the first academic semes-
ter and the Fancy Dress Ball, “out-
standing collegiate social event in
the South.”

This year, for the first time since
before World War I, the end of Janu-
ary will mean neither. It won't sig-
nify anything, except that February
is about to begin.

The end of January won't bring
eager young ladies from all over the
country whose hearts have been set
on “going to the Fancy Dress Ball”
the whole past 12 months, All the
end of January will bring is income
tax statements.

Of course, there will be dinces
and concerts and “big weekend,”
this winter. But they won't be
“Fancy Dress,” and so it won't be
the same.

Fancy Dress was a between-the-
semester diversion begun in 1907 as
a private costume party given by
Miss Annie White, the schcol’s li-
brarian. It is now the victim of edu-
cational progress.

You see, there is no longer a
January semester break at all. If
you want to be technical, there
aren't even semesters any more,
There are “terms,” and the first one
ends in December, and Christrnas
vacation follow, not the Fancy Dress
Ball. Students still take the same
number of classes a year, and there
are still as many weeks of school.

But now there isn't any room for
the Fancy Dress Ball.

WAL isn't geographically isolated
the way it used to be. When Fancy
Dress began, it was a rare occasion
when a girl could make the trip
across the mountains for a date.
Now, though, with airplaines and ‘n-
terstates, a date is hardly a onc2-a-
semester treat.

Just as important, Washington
and Lee isn't the only school to di-
vide #ts year into terms of unequal
length instead of semesters. Girls
all over the country—the daughters
of the girls who used to charier
whole railroad cars to come to Lex-
ington for Fancy Dress from New

BY ROBERT BAROODY

There has been a diarrhea of opi-
nion about the “Love Story” pheno-
menon, Especially noted is the fact
that the familiar “Now a Paramount
motion picture starring .. .” is more
than deceit: “Love Story” was con-
ceived of as a soreenplay, made into
an Ali McGraw movie, and finally
published as the one hundred thirty-
one page bestseller, Next, of course
the critics attempt to explain the
success of “Love Story” (or rather
that of scriptwriter-novelist Brich
Segal) in the context of some sort
of neo-romentic trend that seems to
have salvaged the torn psyche of
“Vieinamized” America

Now | am not a snob, Segal’
story-telling style is almost admirable
in its modern simplicity; and the
film, faithful to that same simplicity,
is technically proficient but not ela
borate .1f anyone deserves to be chas-
tised for the “Love Story” pheno
menon, it is the American public
More than purchasing the five mil
lion paperback copies or flocking to
the film, it is their determination
that “Love Story” offers The Truth
which I find so nauseating. There is
nothing tragic or cosmic in the anti
septic death of Jenny. We must take
“Love Story” for what it iss a mind

On Rising Sap

Orleans, Louisville, Atlanta, Chic-
ago——don't have a January beak
any longer, either,
Everybody agrees your education-
al opportunities are better this way.
But even so, you can't help feel-
ing that doesn't really make up for
giving up the Fancy Dress Ball.
Back in the olden days, not every-
body felt that way. The lute Dr.
Ollinger Crenshaw, Washington and
Lee’s noted historian, reported that
soon after the Ball was born a cer-
tain professor of Greek was moved
‘by the goings-on at one Fancy Dress
to condemn publicly “moderr-siyle
dancing” — performed beyond the
sight of chaperones, the strait-laced
educator took pains to point out—
as well as “the indecency of attire.”
If he didn’t like it then, he would
probably be overjoyed now to know
that there is no more Fancy Dress.
So would the students who, in 1919,
passed a resolution denouncing “all
distasteful and exaggerated forms of
dancing such as the ‘shimmy’.” And
80 too, if he were around, might the
administrator who banned the Big
Apple from Washington and Lee in
the 1920s as a moral outrage.

But those types were few and far
between, The ones who loved Fancy
Dress were legion—whole 2enera-
tions of students and faculty and ad-
ministrators, not to mention their
ladies.

By 1913, Annie White's “Ba! Mas-
que” had already become a tradition
That year, “the largest assemblage of
college girls ever seen in Lexington”
attended the Ball— 300 “blooming
and pretty young lady students,’ ac-
cording to a chronicler of that day.
They were accompanied, he hasten-
ed to add, by “three lady instructors.”

The themes at Fancy Dress were
as elaborate as student minds could
conceive. They spent months, liter-
ally, re-creating European courts of
the Gilded Age, magnificent ante-
bellum plantations, majestic casinos,
one year even Heaven itself,

They spent still more time on the
figures, those intricate musical pro-
cessions of students and dates in
conyplex, carefully planned designs

less little diversion as important to
our lives as was the hula-hoop.

Withdrawn from their fantastic,
mutually infatuated world, the char-
acters of Oliver and Jenny appeas
to be pathetic. Have you ever con-
sidered the Barrett's future had
Jenny lived? Maybe Jenny would
have written “The Diary of A Mad
Housewife;” or maybe, just maybe,
Oliver would have become Presiden
of the United Siaies . . . or at least
Auorney General.

lt is too much, however, to ask
for intelligence and emotion. The
dominant emotion, | suspect, being
self pity. What else could empty the
lear ducts of pubescent teeny-bop
pers and menopausal spinsters alike?
Tere is no perfection and litile
beauty in their lives. Thank God for
escapism!

Why this outpouring of venom?

Well, friends, the time is terribiy
out of joint for us to adere some
thing so puerile as “Love Story.’

One early year, every student at
Washington and Lee marched in the
figure. (There is no record of who
was left to watch.) Their dates ali
wore hats of certain colors, and
when they were done they had forn:-
ed into the university's crest, hardly
a simple pattern.

In the thirties, Fancy Des, be-
came to American college girls what
the Ascot Gavotte was io Eliza
Doolittle. The radio networks al-
ways broadcast it—‘live from Lex-
ington, Virginia!”"—and if you were
a big-band leader you knew you
hadn't made it yet if you hadn't
played the Fancy Dress Ball.

There are still big bands. But it's
not the same as it was in the heyday
of Miller and the Dorseys and Guod-
man and Harry James and Glen
Gray and Artie Shaw. Radio is still
around too. But not like it was with
The First Nighter and Amos ‘n’
Andy and Easy Aces.

And there are still social events.
But, sadly to be sure, there isn't
anything left quite like the old Fancy

LETTERS TO

‘Conventional’ Dress?

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

You are correct in assuming that
former alumni will question what
has happened to the reputation of
Washington and Lee University. The
students make the school and. con-
sequently, the reputation. However,
those who believe that the casual
(sloppy) dress reflects the loss of
personal and school pride are guilty
of the “pathetic fallacy” you attri-
bute to those who dress to be.ome
“au courant.” Perhaps those who
judge on such a scale are not worth
impressing.

| was also troubled by your edi-
torial’s statement pertaining to the
wppearance of our students at the
basketball game. The mode of dress
did not affect the team's perform-
ance as proven by the victory. You
stated that our students looked as if
they should have been from Buena
Vista, This remark bothered me far
more than anything else you said.
Just because 60 per cent of the fam-
ilies in Rockbridge County have a
yearly income of under $5090 and
can not afford $100 herring bone
suits does not mean that they ae
worthy of derogatory statements that
somehow imply that they are inferior
and less deserving of respect than
we pampered students. Perhaps they
could look richer if the demand for
hous ng Was not so great (a problem
to which WAL students contribute
immensely).

| am a sloppy dresser for the fol-
lowing reasons:

1) | dress to be comfortable.

2) | do not wish to be arrested
for indecent exposure.

3) T am guilty of the “pathetic
fallacy.” First, | want peuple to
know that I believe traditions, those
natural enemies of logic and raorm
(pardon the allegory), are of nu use
im an institution where progres: is a
basic goal, Second, | want people to
know that I'm not a conservative
(guess I'm an effete snob), Third, 1
elways thought that students who
wore jackets and ties were brown-
nosing the teachers (a carry-ove: of
my high school days). Fourth, I'm

Frosh Analyzed
In National Test

More than a third of Washington
and Lee University’s freshmen plan
to become lawyers and a sixth of
them say they want to be physicions,
according to a survey taken last tall
by the American Council on Educa-
tion.

With 36.4 per cent choosing law
as a profession and 15.7 per cent
medicine, the figures at Washington
and Lee are substantially higher than
nationwide averages, the Council re-
ported,

Nationally, its survey showed 6.3
per cent of America’s freshmen as
future lawyers and 5.2 per cent as
physicians,

Only a tenth of the freshmen at
Washington and Lee have jawyers
for fathers, and the fathers of even
fewer are doctors or dentists.

With law and medicine together
claiming more than half of the 372
Washington and Lee freshmen who
participated in the survey—18 did
not take part—business as a pro-
fession ran a poor third, with only
10.1 per cent of the universiiy’s
freshmen interested in it. That was
considerably behind the national
male freshman average, 16.7 per
cent,

The fourth most popular occup:-
tional category at Washington and
Lee, judging by freshman plans, was
the arts. Almost 9 per cent said they
plan to become artists or performers,
double the national proportion.

Washington and Lee’s freshmen
‘parted company with entering stu-
dents elsewhere in the nation in sev-
eral other characteristics as well, the
American Council's survey showed.

More than a sixth of them, 17.7
per cent, were editors of their sec-
ondary school newspaper, twice the
national men’s proportion.

Nearly half, 45.2 per cent, be-
longed to a scholastic honor society,
and 18.5 per cent won National
Merit Scholarship recognition ---
again, doubling the national propor-
tions for male freshmen.

Twenty-two per cent had A aver-
ages in high school, compared with
just 13 per cent nationally, and four-
fifths of the rest had B averages.

But despite major differences in
career plans and scholastic back-
grounds, Washington and Lee’s fresh-
men were close to national averages
in political and social notions.

Only a tiny minority at Washing-

(Continued on Page 4)

pride is justified by the way anycne
dresses.

In conclusion, a number of WAL
freshmen applied in spite of the con-
servative atmosphere that permeates
this campus. Mr. Editor, you dress
your way and I'll dress mine. You
wear a jacket and tie while I wear
“jeans (with at least one rip in the
knee), no socks (except in designat-
ed winter months), no tie, and a
shirt (perfectly wrinkled).” Do and
impress whoever you want, but, as
for me, “I'm gonna wave my freak
flag high.”

Boo’s For B-Ball Buffs
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Last month at the varsity baskel-
ball game, I was the unhappy wit-
ness of an appalling sort of specta-
tor conduct. The sound of a referee's
whistle invariably produced a Palo-
vian thunder of boo's and vile epit-
hets from the over-ardent W&L
rooters.

kt did not even matter who the
call was on; the result was the same.
If, as it often was, the call was
against Lynchburg, the hecklers
would change their hoots, in mid-
breath, to “Alright!”, “It's about
time, ref!", “Right on!", “Pinally
got you S4!", and the like. The ac-
tion and physical exertion off the
court rivaled the game, as the root-
ers never-<easingly mercilessly mock-

Dance Board Plans

During the past few weeks | have
been approached by a number of
students desiring to know what en-
tertainmemt the Dance Board has
planned for the winter term, In or-
der to answer questions regarding
the Dance Board's rather nebulous
aotivities I felt that a letter of clari-
fication was necessary.

For this term's concert weekends
we have contracted a variety of
groups that encompass neerly the
emire gamut of students’ eniertain-
ment preferences, The first “big
weekend” of the winter term will be
that of February Sth and 6th. On
Friday night the Allman #rothers

Roundballers Rally, Deliver
Emory & Henry Its Ninth Loss

BY PALMER TRICE

Wednesday night marked the re-
turn of the Generals to the victory
column. They notched a 90-58 win
over the Emory and Henry Wasps.
W&L looked very impressive in their
first showing of the new semester.
Despite a three week layoff, or per-
haps because of it, the Blue found a
previous lacking zing. They looked
crisp.

The New Year renewed club spir-
its, whiich had fallen to a record low
after their disappointing loss to
Hampden-Sydney’s Tigers. In this
outing, our ball club took an 83-79
knock on the chin. While they did
hustle, the lid stayed on the basket
for most of the game. The Tigers
threatened to run away with the
contest for much of the game. A
late spurt brought the club within
sight of victory, but it fell short.
This game proved the old adage—
any team can beat any other team
on a given night, Wait til they come
to Doremus.

The Wasps came into last night's
‘ball game having played six games
since the home team’s last outing.
Emory and Henry carried a meagre
3-8 record into the battle, but have
shown signs of improvement since
an 0-5 start.

The Generals have been practic-
ing since the beginning of 1971.
Their practices have been spirited,
and so was their game performance.
Coach Canfield inserted two new
starters into the 1971 version of the
roundballers. Hatton Smith and, for
the first time, Dave Stone replaced
Ellie Gutshall and injured Charlie
Strain, Hatton, the quickest man on

the squad, ran the ball club like a
pro.

Mr. Stone, the hardened veteran
of last year's campaign, showed how
he earned his letter by tossing in a
game high total of 20 points. Dave
shot a blistering 60% from the floor.
He was 2 for 2 from the foul line.
He will provide a much needed scor-
ing punch for the General’s attack.

Tall Paul McClure led our of-
fense in the first half with 13 points.
He also led the squad to a 75-47 ad-
vantage on the boards. A sterling
performance by the ‘big man.

Team captain Mike Daniel went
into the game with a 20.2 average.
He came up with 15 big ones, He
led the tenacious defense that let the
usually high scoring Wasps put but
19 points on the board during the
first half. The crowd never got to
see if their team was out of shape, 1s
10 boys got a chance to play in the
first half. Everyone ‘but Charlie
Strain played. A turned ankle pre-
vented Charlie from breaking out of
his December slump. Maybe next
time Charlie?

Analyzing the victory, two points
stand out in particular. The ball
club displayed a new, or previously
hidden team pride. The boys were
on the floor afiter the ball. To put it
simply, they hustled like they have
never hustled this season. Mel Cart-
right, an All-American here last year,
summed up the second reason when
he said that they were the least sel-
fish team that he had seen, almost
to a fault.

This was the Generals’ best per-
formance of the season. They shot a
respectable 40% from the floor. Mc-

Clure and Co. controlled the boards,
rarely letting the Wasps get a second
or third shot. Emory and Henry shot
only 28%, mostly due to a brilliant
team defense. Everyone played, and
everyone scored. Even though the
bench was emptied, the defense never
lagged.

The squad leaves today for St.
Petersburg, and a first round bout
with undefeated King College, in
the first round of the Concoast
Classic. King is 10-0. Their starting
line-up runs 68”, 65”, 6°4”, 62”,
and 6-0”. The Generals must con-
trol the boards in this contest. On
January 13, W&L visits Annapolis.
This game, which promises to be 4
tough contest, will be broadcast oa

cannot be there, tune in.

The Jayvees, now 4-0, have their
first game of the year at VMI next
Tuesday. It should be quite a game,
as the VMI frosh are also unde-
feated.

will be the Dance Board’s answer to
James Taylor. On that night James’
younger brother Livingston [aylor
will entertain us with the songs which
are native to his North Carolina
background. Livingston's perform-
ance should appease those who de-
sired to see James here at W&L.

Later in the month on February
20th the rising country-rock group,
Poco, will visit Doremus gym for a
lively Saturday night conceri. This
group acclaimed by * Playboy” maga-
zine to be one of the fastest rising
rock groups around puts on a show
equaled only by Three Dog Night
or Credence Clearwater Pevival.

To wrap up the winter term we
will swing back to the music of the
late 50's with Sha-na-na on Satur-
day, March 20th. This anomaly of
Woodstock should appeal to all
those who are still in a limbo be
tween soul and rock music.

If student response to these “big
weekends” is financially satisiactory
the Dance Board hopes to provide
ene more “big weekend” in cither
late April or early May. However,
such a weekend will materialize only
if enough people buy dance plans or
purchase tickets at the door to the
winter concerts to make financing
of a spring term weekend poss'ble.

Presently, we are doing our very
best to provide a maximum number
of quality entertainers with our
rather dubious financial budget.
Hopefully, your support of the win-
ter term's concerts will make the

addition of a spring term weekend a
reality instead of a mere dream,

ed and degraded Lynchburg. Every
two words were punctuated by the
classic four letter words. All this
when the ball game had hardly be-
gun.

Perhaps such conduct is accepted
and considered the norm in_ this
rea. However, I, for one, found 1
disgusting. Never in my life have |
seen such conduct condoned, even
by the youth. The conduct dismally
reminded me of the senseless crowds
drooling over the gladiators in 4
Roman coliseum.

There is no value in sports when
sportsmanship is lost. Then sports
resemble a controlled war like the
great game played in Vietnam. Such
conduct is hardly sportsmanlike.
Nor does it befit the so called W&L
“gentleman”.

Leiters To The Editor . . .

 

Reader Speaks

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

It's been a peaceful year here, and
there is nothing wrong with peace.
But, we sit here in our semi-haven
university and not look at what
seems to me a world spiralling down-
ward. What is wrong with us? Jt
doesn't have to be that way. I know
many people are involved in various
worthy activities. I also realize that
some people think that college stu-
dents can have little effect on world
affairs,

But now I wonder; do we care?

Senator Mark Hatfield will speak at W&L next week.

Jessup Court Team Picked

Four law students—William D.
Elliot, Lawrence E. Morhous, Ro-
bert B. Schatz, IL], and Parker S.
Wise, Jr.—have been selected to
represent Washington and Lee in
the 1971 Phillip C. Jessup Inter-
national Law Moot Court Competi-
tion,

The team, the first ever entered
by Washington and Lee, is sponsored
by the newly-formed Society of In
ternational Law. The regional com-

petition will be held on March 20-21

at a location yet to be announced.

The annual competition, establish-
ed in 1961, is sponsored by the As-
sociation of Student International
Law Societies and the American
Society of International Law. This
year’s problem encompasses issues
of aircraft hijacking, murder, kid-
napping, and extradition.

The selection of the team was
under the direction of Professor
Lawrence D. Gaughan, sponsor of
the Society of International Law.
The team members are all second-
year law students,

Do we really want to come t. grips
with what is going on outside of a
60 mile radius? Whether we care or
not, the world is going on and while
we wait for the future when we will
be “in the world,” our futures are
being determined, if not ruined,
now,

Now, and what do we care’ The
old line “War, Pollution, Poverty,
Hunger” is becoming worn out while
the problems are getting worse. We
must do something. I feel we can if
we sincerely want to.

My part is to work with Rock-

IN JOINT

On Class of ’73

This report on the activities of
ithe Sophomore Class thus far this
year is being made in hopes of in-
forming and arousing interest in
‘the Sophomore Class by its mem-
bers. On November 17th, a Sopho-
more Class meeting was called to:
(1) find out the general attitude of
ithe Sophomore Class (2) to report on
the budget of the class and (3) to
announce that applications were be-
ing accepted for a Sophomore com-
mittee which would decide how the
surplus money would be used and
which weu!ld hopefully draw the
class closer, together.

Having left the freshman dorms,
students live in a widespread area
and many have contact with the
people they knew as Freshmen. We
find it increasingly difficult to get a
true picture of the class’ needs and
desires. It is our hope that through
this committee we can regain the
sense of unity our class had as fresh-
men,

At the class meeting we had a

ll tunn-out. A total of 18 pe»
ple came. Some people later remark-
ed that they didn't see the posters,
but for the most part, the small at-
tendance was due to the age-old
problem of apathy. Last year our
Freshman class displayed more unity
than most classes ever do; but it ap-
pears that this year, having lost the
day to day associations we had in
the dorms, that our class is gradually
developing the W&L tradition of
apathy.

The following was discussed at the
Sophomore class meeting: (1) The
Budget: $2300 was collected in class
dues and was spent in the following
manner:

$1321.00 for grain

$ 300.00 for the band

$ 40.44 for cups

$ 76.80 for mix

$ 27.09 trash cans and servers
$ 26.00 for ice

$ 12.50 for posters

$ 12.50 for a garden hose

for a total of $1,816.33.

Left in the class treasury is ap-
proximately $500 and (2) How to
use the surplus money? We have
thought of four possibilities: (a) We
can pool our money with the Junior
class and turn the Springs Weekend
cocktail party into a semi-rock festi-
val with four or five good bands and
a bar, (b) hold a sophomore class
party with a good band and set-ups

Contact Studies High

BY SKIP PAUKERT

A nationally prominent history
professor, an advocate of the New
Right, and a lawyer from the New
Left were featured in the opening
programs of “Contact '71” this week.
All three gentlemen addressed them-
selves to topics related to this year’s
theme, “the Crisis in Education.”

“Contact,” an annual symposium
on contemporary issues and prob-
lems, offered its initial presentation
Monday with Dr. K. Ross Toole.
The “Contact” speeches will con-
tinue through next week.

Dr. Toole, a professor of history
at the University of Montana, re-
ceived national attention with the
publication of his article, “The Ty-
ranny of Spoiled Brats,” in several
national periodicals,

Dr. Toole demonstrated himself
to be much of a political liberal in
his views on current issues. He ad-
dressed his speech “to those of you
who may be thinking about giving
up on the system.” He emphasized
that the American political scheme
was imperfect and that reforms were
badly needed, both in foreign and
domestic policy, but he urged that
change must come peacefully and

that recourse to violence was
real alternative.”

Toole pointed to the gathering at
Woodstock as an example of the

latent solidarity and power of youth

“no today. “You must learn the poi'tical

process, and you must learn how to
utilize power,” he said.

Toole criticized student activists
today for being, above all, “myopic.”

Watt Appointed College Dean;
Pusey Steps Down To Teach

The President of the University
announced Monday that Dr. Wil-
liam J. Watt will accept the duties of
Dean of the College, effective next
July 1. He succeeds Dean William
Webb Pusey III, who is returning to
full-time teaching after 11 years of
service as head of the university's
arts and sciences division.

It was revealed that Dean Pusey
had indicated his desire to return to
the chassroom to the Board of Trus-
tees last summer, He will resume his
duties as professor and chairman of
the German Department.

Dr. Watt presently serves as as-
sociate dean of the College. There
was no suggestion as to when or
how a successor will be named to
that post.

Dr. Watt has been a member of
the faculty since 1955. He received
a Bachelor of Science Degree from
the University of Minos in 1949, a
master’s degree from Cornell Uni-
versity in 1951, and his Ph. D. from
Cornell in 1956,

Dr. Pusey came to Washington
and Lee in 1939, the year he earned
his Ph.D. degree from Columbia
University. He also holds a B. S. de-
gree from Haverford College and
an M.A, degree from Harvard.

He served as Acting President of
the University from late 1967 unti
President Huntley took office on
February 5, 1968.

In Monday's announcement Presi-
dent Huntley offered his “deep zrati-
tude—and that of all associated

 
 

with Washington and Lee—to Dr.
Pusey for his decade of invaluable
service as dean.” He added that Or.
Pusey’s “patient and thoughtful lea/-
ership has given the university a
quality of true academic strength,
which will be abiding.”

The selection of Dr. Watt to as-
sume duties as dean of the College,
the president said, “commends itself
on every ground—ability, scholar-
ship, experience.”

er Education

He traced the history of the labor
and farm movements in the United
States, and the reforms brought
about by LaFollette’s Progress ves
and the labor unions, “But you must
have patience, courage, and, »bove
all, tenacity,” he continued.

Toole urged that students begin
to exercise their potent power by
using such tools as the boycott. In
answer to a question on national
priorities, he listed (1) the eradica-
tion of poverty, (2) the preservation
of the ecology, and (3) the resiora-
tion of universities as teaching in-
stitutions,

In answer to another question,
Toole advocated the immediate with-
drawal of U.S, forces from Vietnam,
saying “I haven't met a hawk in

three years.”

Tuesday brought the pairing of
two very unique speakers having a
mutually extensive background in
radical movements. Philip Abbott
Luce, a former Communist and rev-
olutionary, broke with the Left in
1965 and turned to the right wing,
culminating in his work with the
Young Americans for Freedom as
head of their college division.

Leonard Weinglass, an attorney
for many of the nations most promi-
nent leftists, was co-counse! for the
defense with William Kunstler at the
“Chicago 8” trial.

Mr. Luce began his day on camp-
us with a seminar in the afternoon
in the Student Center library, where
he recounted his political evolution
from editor of the national organ of
the communist Progressive Labor
Party to an advocate of rightist lib-
ertarianism.

Luce oniticized the coercive nature
of the state in many elements of
American life, especially education.
In his speech in Lee Chapel Tues-
day evening, he prefaced his re-
marks by saying, “the whcle of the
public educational system is deca-
dem, and we are in need of revoiu-
tionary ideas.”

“I oppose state education because
of its very nature,” he said. Not only

did he think that governmental von-
trol kept down the potential quality
of education, but also “it ‘s implicit
in that educational process that there
is an attempt to indoctrinate stu-
dents in an allegiance to the
state...”

He emphasized the importance of
the years in a child's life from ages
1-5, which are wasted under the
status quo. He also characterized
the 12 years of public primary and
secondary education as “to a large
degree, simply a device to keep you
off the streets,”

Troubs Offer

New Drama

In Shakespeare's “Hamlet” there
are two minor characters which have
little to do with the action of the
Bard’s most famous tragedy. Rosen-
crantz and Guildenstern are two
gentlemen who are appointed by the
King of Denmark to discover the
cause of Hamlet's madness.

They are dead by the conclusion
of the play.

Tom Stoppard’s “Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead” focuses on
the fate of this hapless pair. It is a
comedy, however, and it will be per-
formed here on February 9 through
13 by the Troubadour Theatre.

“Auditions were, thankfully, in
December,” said Mrs. Bilen Barnes,
director for the production. Speak
ing of the rehearsals, Mrs. Barnes
noted that “we're not there yet, but
we're on our way.”

The cast has been in rehearsal for
the production since before the
Christmas holidays. Which is as it
should be, for the Troubadour
Theatre plans to take the show on a
tour to other colleges in Virginia be-
fore it comes home to W&L for 4
five night run. Performances of “Ro-
sencrantz and Guildenstern” will be
given at Mary Baldwin, Randolph
Macon, Roanoke College, Radford,
and the University of Richmond
during its run on tour February 2
through the 6th.

_Stoppard’s play weaves the scripi
of “Hamlet” throughout the course
of his comedy. Yet the action of the
play centers primarily on the comic
and sometimes pathetic befuddle-
mem of Rosencrantz and Guilden
stern as they attempt to unravel the
mystery of their situation in the in-
trigue of the court of Denmark.

“I suppose I would be lying to
anyone if I told them | totally Un-
derstood the play,” said Mrs, Barnes
“I think it’s a brilliant piece, but |
don't think anyone would be telling

Our Mini-‘Crisis In Education’

Interesting isn’t it, that with the beginning of “Contact thy”
we have had the appearance of a group which sat in the Co-op
this week asking for signatures to end R.O.T.C. credit at the
University. It would seem that the members of this group were
attempting to create its own mini-“Crisis in Education” in
order to make “Contact '71” more “relevant.”

Apart from the fact that they're belatedly attempting to get
into the act along with the distinguished speakers W&L is
fortunate enough to have here during this week, this group of
students seems to have a murky conception of the word “edu-
cation,” hence the mini-crisis.

The demand for the elimination of academic credit for
R.O.T.C. is as absurd as the demand that a study of the Re-
naissance be put to a vote of the gtudent body to test its “rele-
vancy.” The points is, education is not democratic or even a
matter of casting a vote for or against one course. If it were,
there would be several students we know who'd vote against
courses throughout the school because of the grade they re-
ceived last term or because they thought the professors too
liberal, too dull, or too conservative.

We doubt that many of the people in this group are enrolled
in R.O.T.C. We doubt that they would appreciate it if people
fro mother persuasions started a petition to eliminate philoso-
phy or english or politics or drama credit. “Relevance” cannot
be defined by one’s own personal perspective. If it were, then
there would be no courses at W&&L offered for credit. The
armed forces (fortunately or unfortunately) are as much of the
reality of everyone's common experience here and elsewhere as
is the question of the economic future of the United States. The
problem students have to cope with is not whether R.O.T.C.
should be offered for credit, but whether or not they should
take R.O.T.C. for credit.

(It amuses us that no moral arguments would likely be
raised at all if there weren't a war going on somewhere which
threatened the immediate future of students on this campus.
The moral arguments take the stand that R.O.T.C. is not aca-
demic, but the real motivation behind this argument is anti-
war beliefs of this group of students.)

The real crisis in the educational system today is the misuse
of the word “education.” We hope that tempests in teapots
such as the thinly disguised political line “end R.O.T.C. credit”
will not affect the bright future education has here.

The Craze: Retrospective

It tends to be that our arithmetic was slightly in error last

week.

200 Honor Roll students

+400 Dean's List students

=Not 600 but 400 Honor Roll and Dean's List students.

So our casual estimate of one-half of the student body mak-
ing Dean's List and Honor Roll is reduced to 36 percent. Even
with this reduced percentage, the significance of this marked
rise in figures is not diminished. We reiterate our proposal that
requirements for Dean's List should be changed from 3.0 to
3.2 and those for Honor Roll from 3.5 to 3.6.

Especially in view of the fact that the Class of 1971 was one
of the contributing factors in the rise of the percentage for this
term. 162 out of the 262 members of the class made a GPR of
3.0 or above, with 73 seniors on the Honor Roll. One wonders
whether the overall intelligence of the senior class has mel-
lowed with age here at W&L. Whether it has or not is a moot
point. However, we think the more stringent requirements for
recognition of academic distinction are necessary and valid,

Dropping Drop-Add Bureaucracy

In the past four years, this paper has seen an incredible
amount of change. Some of it has been good, some bad, but at
least the driving motive has been one of improvement. One
can look back and be proud of the fact that we have changed.

But in all our change something seems to have been left
untouched. It recurs twice annually, but the aggravation ts
short-lived and goes before one has time to really notice it,
generally speaking. However, we have had trouble with it, and
it has remained in our minds,

It is not uncommon to spend two days changing one’s
schedule. One must first track down at least four signatures
whose authors always seem to be away, After walking from
the two course professors, the student must go to the Dean
and waste his time making sure that everything is all right
To add insult to injury, the course changes cost $5

In a school that prides itself on a personal touch, and in a
.chool where data processing is used quite efficiently in an ad
ministrative capacity, it seems absurd that the archaic system
of course changes is allowed to exist as it does

The funny thing is that the needed change ts really quite
simple, All the student should have to do is go to his advisor
and ask for the change. If the Deans feel it is necessary to make
sure everything is functioning properly, they should have a list
of changes sent to them

I'm sure that less than five per cent of the course changes
are in error in some way (besides actual mistakes on the Drop
\dd slips). This school must take in a couple of thousand dol
lars on course changes, Well, maybe taht’s permissible, but the
fee should not be used as a deterrent

Washington and Lee’s CONTACT
‘71 symposium, focusing on the gen-
eral theme, “The Crisis in Educa-
tion,” will continue with a broad
cross-section of speakers.

Friday night Dr. Charles Hamil-
ton of Columbia University will
speak in Lee Chapel. Dr. Hamilton
will discuss “Ohanging and Ex-
panding Curricula for Blacks and
Whites.”

Hamilton, professor of Urban
Studies at Columbia, was co-author
with Stokeley Carmichel of Black
Power: Politics of Liberation in
America. A discussion period will
follow the address.

On Monday, U.S. Senator Mark
O. Hatfield, (R.-Ore) will offer an
address in Evans Dining Hall. Hat-
field, prominent member of the Sen
ate and co-sponsor of a controver-
sial Cambodian legislation is for-
imerly an associate professor and
dean of students at Williamette Uni-
versity in Salem, Oregon.

Hatfield, whose recent bout with
flu necessitated a change in the ori-
ginal CONTACT ‘71 schedule, will
be the guest of honor at a cocktail
party at the Psi Upsilon House start-
ing at 7 p.m. His speech will be fol-
lowed by a question and answer
period.

The Senator is expected to speak
en “Reordering Our Priorities: In-
creased Aid to Higher Education.”

On Tuesday, Dr. David Donald,
the Harry G. Black Professor of His-
tory at The Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity, and a Pulizter Prize winner,
will deliver the Lee’s Birthday,
Founer's Day Convocation at noon
in Evans Hall.

CONTACT resumes on Wednes-
day, January 20 with the appear-
ance of Dr. Arthur Hansen, presi-
dent of the Georgia Institute of
Technology. Hansen, described by
CONTACT chairman Madison Cole
as a “dynamic speaker” will address
himself to the topic, “Technology,
Our Terror or Our Triumph,”

The symposium will conclude on
Friday, January 22, with the joint
appearance of Rep. Philip Crane,
(R.-Il.) and Dr. Harald Taylor.

Crane, a prominent conservative,
was elected to the Senate in 196).
Taylor was formerly president of
Sarah Lawrence College, and he was
noted for innovations, among them
the “Free University” concept. He
is the author of Students Without
Teachers: The Crisis in the Univer-
sity.

Both men will conduct afternoot
seminars, Crane in Reid Hall, and
Taylor in the University Center Li-
brary.

Dr. Taylor will be honored at ¢
cocktail party at the Phi Kappa Sig-
ma house at 7 p.m.

Contact chairman Matt Cole urges
all students to make the fullest use
of the opportunities presented by
this year’s symposium possible. The
fact that the student body finances

and IFC co-sponsorship means that
the speakers visit the campus for
the benefit of all students.

The support of the student body
will mean that in the future we can
enjoy programs such as this, and
can continue to attract key people in
the country to the symposium.

However, to provide speakers such
as Dr. Hamilton, Sen. Hatfield, Dr.

In the past two evenings “Con-

different forms of discussion, one in-
telligent and enlightening the other
bland and embarrassing. Surprising-
ly enough they came from the
sources we least expected.

Last night in Lee Chapel Philip
Luce and Leonard Weinglass en-
gaged in something less than a de-
‘bate. I fully expected a knock-down-
drag-out affair but was pleasantly
surprised with the civility and per-
ception of the participants. Anyone
who was there will attest to the fact
that there seemed to be little dis-

Radio ‘Shadow’

“Who knows what evil lurks in
the hearts of men? .. . The Shadow
knows, ...”

These few words, coming over the
old crystal radio set, were enough to
send audiences of the late °30's, the
‘40's, and the early ‘50's into fit. of
scurrying and jockeying for position
to hear the latest installment of the
weekly serial

Now, so that presumably The
Shadow might know what evil lurks
in the hearts of WAL students, the
shew is being brought to WLUR

During the more than 12 years
that the shadow wa
that the show was featured on ne!
work radio, four men played the
lead. First was the late Arthur Vin
ton. followed by Orson Welles, Bi'!
Johnstone and Bret Morrison. Sup
porting them in the cast were names

such as Agnes Morehead and the
recenily-deceased Edward Ll verett
Sloane

The stories of The Shadow had

ther origination in the dime-novel
publishing house of Street and Smith
m 1915. Written by mystery author
Walter Gibson, the tales were 80

group of radio stations (which we

der.

Feb. 23——-NEVER GIVE A SUCK-
ER AN EVEN BREAK—W. (
Fields, Glorma Jean, Lion Errol

“Anyone who hates dogs and chil
tren can't be all bad.”

The W&L Film Committee will
hold an informal discussion to select
films for the remainder of the year
on Thursday, at 7 p.m. All interesied
people are urged to come to the
Cockpit,

teresting to note that in many ways
we saw a result of two peopie who
are described as “left” and “right”
coming into agreement because they
have come full circle on the political
spectrum, which is, in my way., re-
assuring. Restricting themselves, for
the most part, to the field of educa-
tion, they made some very important
points. Luce in his opening renvaerks
made the point that public education
in America has failed and thar it
exists primarily for the benefit and
continuance of the state. It feil upon
Weinglass to defend the state and
the necessity for the state to be re-
sponsive. This struck me as strange
coming from a member of the “New
Left.” It seems to me that if any-
thing revolutionary groups, whom
Mr. Weinglass counts as his clients,
are Opposed to the monolith that is
the government. But the basic point
remains that Mr. Weinglass and Mr.
Luce are both opposed to the form
the government has taken today and
especially in its relation to educa-
tion.

I would have to draw as ther
point of disagreement their attitudes

bout what the new posture of edu
cation and of government should be.
Mr. Luce made it quite chear that he
feels that an attitude of laissezfaire
towards education is necessary. He
felt that the parents should take up
the total responsibility for their chil-
dren’s education. Mr. Weinglass
countered with the salient point that
thi swould be difficult if not impos-
sible to accomplish in the Black
community or in Poverty areas,
Weinglass felt that the state is noi
teaching what is relevant or impor-
tant. He felt that in our “post-in-
dustrial” world we must be open to
anything and everything for our edu-
gation to be effective. He also
brought up the point of community
in relation to the campus environ-
ment. He said that four years in co!
lege isolate us from our communit:
and leave us in a limbo that we
never really get out of. This i:ola-
tion resulis in the creation of an
elite and an elite that is not in com-
munication with the other segments
of the society.

What one came out with here is
that education is primarily a tool
of the state so the siate can continue.
It is obvious that they both are dis-
enchanted with their education and
the one we are receiving. Luce’s
thesis that we should adopt a laisse ’-
faire policy is to me misguided and
can only end in greater disassocia
tion between individuals and be-
tween individuals and the society
itself. Weinglass was far more hon-
est about the role of the state and
the necessity for the slate to reform
so that it can educate with openness,
and effoct-veness. Luce is too quick
to abandon the state for in a society
such as ours the state is not a luxury

Hl 1S & Necessity.

Monday night again in the Chapel
Dr. K. Ross Toole had “Some Com
ments on Student Revolutionaries”.
In a low key address Dr. Yoole
brought out some important and
overlooked problems about student
activism in politics, Dr. Toole told
his audience that America has in the
past overcome her problems and we
will, he hopes, do so again. He be-
moaned the fact that there is a min
ority of students who have given up
on the American system and that
they hyperbolize to point or, to use
his word, they are “myopic”, He
made the point that the McCarthy
campaign showed thal students cin
exert political power but tha: for
some reason it failed in the end. He
claimed that when the revolutionary
says that we have no power he either
lies or is ignoram. One need only
trunspose the power of Woodstock
