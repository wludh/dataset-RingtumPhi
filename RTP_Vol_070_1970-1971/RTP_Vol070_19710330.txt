BY AL ORGAIN
SBA President

On March 23, elections for law

school representatives to the Execu-
tive Committee, University Council,
and the Law Student Division of the
American Bar Association were con-
ducted in the Washington and Lee
Law School.

The results of these elections are
of course important to the welfare of
the Student Bar Association, but the

result of the referendum included |

on the same ballot is even more im-
portant to the long range future of
the S.B.A. This referendum concern-
ed the collection of SBA dues with
the law school tuition.

A little over a year ago, the
S.B.A. unanimously approved a pro-
posal to make S.B.A. membership
mandatory and dues obligatory (i.e.
an integrated bar). The idea behind
having an integrated bar was to ac-
custom future lawyers to the manda-
tory bar membership which they
would encounter on the outside and
at the same time provide continuity
of income for the S.B.A.

This proposal took effect Septem-
ber 1970 after appropriate indica-
tions had been made in the 1970-71
Law School Catalogue. Dues at the
time were $3.00 per year and were
still being collected by the S.B.A.
treasurer on a “hit or miss basis.”

Two months later the SBA voted
to raise dues to $3.00 per semester,
thus adding to the collection head-
aches of the treasurer.

By initiating the integrated bar,
the S.B.A. had taken an important
step forward, but it had not gone as
far as it could to rid itself of the
mechanical difficulties of raising
revenue.

The SBA membership recognized
the problem when they voted on
March 23. With the largest voter
turn out in my experience in law
school the issue of inchiding SBA
dues with tuition passed with nearly
two thirds of the votes in the affir-
mative. Actual results were 122 in
favor of tuition and dues, 65 against,
and 11 abstentions—an amazing de-
gree of agreement for a group of
future lawyers.

Disregarding the outcome the
mere fact that 88.3% of the law stu-
dents voted is a very good sign.
Maybe we're gaining on that old
enemy—apathy.

Bill Anderson, SBA treasurer, is
currently working out the details of
the dues-with-tuition plan with the
University treasurer, Mr. Whitehead.
Assuming that we encounter no in-
soluble problems at this stage we
should begin operation under this
plan in Septemyber of this year.

But why is this dues collection so
important? The point is that with an
assured, easily collectable income
and hopefully with another more
realistic rais cin dues (our dues are
the lowest of the nine other law
schools in this circuit) the SBA
would be more able to expand its
budgetary activities beyond the soc-
ial scene which now demands the
largest portion of our funds.

One area which could certainly
stand substantial financial backing
is our speaker program. In the past
for the most part we had to rely on
speakers who were friends of the
school and did not charge a fee
Needless to say this arrangement did
not always produce the most inter
esting programs, Getting a big name
wus out of the question except on
those infrequent occasions when
Contact had an appropriate epeaker
here. Another improverished activity
is the Placement Commutiee which
has recently undertaken an expan-
sion of its services

Not all of this money should come
from dues. Now | address myself to
Steve Robinson and the other mem
bers of the EC. The SBA needs to
have a larger allocation of the
money we pay as a student activity
fee already included in tuition, Law
students simply do not get the same
rewrn from the activity fee as the
undergraduates, Don Weir, a recem
candidate for Student Body
dent (and the only one to speak to
the SBA) voiced his concern over
this matter to the SBA and said if
elected he would work to get the law
school a bigger share. It may well
been the law school vote for

Moot Court Contest

Robert B. B. Schatz, a second-year
law student at Washington and Lee,
was named best oralist last week in
regional finals of the Philip C. Jessup
International Law Moot Court Com-
petition.

Judges chose Schatz over other
legal debaters from West Virginia,
North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennes-
see, Indiana, Illinois and the District
of Columbia.

The international law moot court
competition was held at the Univer-
sity of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill. This was the first year a team
from Washington and Lee’s law

school has participated.

Schatz is a 1969 graduate of the
University of Wisconsin, where he
received his bachelor of arts degree
magna cum laude with majors in
English and art history. He won
honors for his undergraduate thesis
in English and was named a Wood
row Wilson fellowship finalist.

At Washington and Lee he is a
member of Phi Delta Phi legal fra
ternity, the Student Bar Association,
the campus Young Republicans or-
ganization and the student body's
committee on recruitment of under-

Class Officers Announced;
University Council Elected

Following the final major install-
ment of elections for next year’s stu-
dent body leadership, the EC an-
nounced the results last week of the
coniests for four Exeoutive Com-
mittee positions, two class Officers,
and the seats for the University
Council. Also decided were the Vice-
Presidential races for the Arts, Sci-
ences, and Commerce Schools.

Moon Yee and JoJo Martin led a
field of five to capture the two Sen-
ior EC seats. Archer Frierson topip-
ed incumbent Craig Jones, 90 votes
to 72, in the Junior EC match. The
Sophomore representative will be
Russ Fletcher, who preserved his
seat by a seven-vote margin.

Bo Brookby decisively bested Bert
Meem for the presidency of the Sen-
ior Class. In the runoff for Vice-
President of the Sophomore Class,
Bo Dudley drew 143 ballots to 86
for his opponent Clifton Overcash.
Phe recently-conceived University
ouncil, to be composed of 12 stu-
dents and 12 faculty members, is
scheduled to assume functions this
pring. But, because of a voting
fluke, the full student delegation is
yet to be decided.

There are to be four Seniors,
three Juniors, two Sophomores, and
one Freshman on the Council, and
election to these positions last Mon-
day was by plurality of votes cast.
[he winners from the Senior Class
and their vote tallies were: Don

each receiving 76 votes. Similarly,
Ted Amshoff, Paul Hartmann, Mar-
tin Stein tied, with 66, in the Sopho-
more race, with Lewis Powell receiv-
ing 137 votes to capture the first seat.

The EC, faced with a chance di-
lemma, at first decided to flip a coin
in the Junior and Sophomore dead-
locks, and Robertson and Amshoff
emerged as the winners ‘by lot. But it
was decided that such a method of

determination was unfair, and the
run-offs for these two University
Council positions will be decided on
April 21, after the Spring term com-
mences.

Also revealed last Thursday were
the outcomes of the contests for V.P.
of the Arts, Sciences, and Commerce
Schools. Charlie Holbrook drew 38
votes, to beat Ned Moore and John
Lawlor. Charlie Pride was elected
Vice-President of the Sciences.

Lock Handley Selected As
EC Law Representative

Lock Handley, a second year Law
student from Arcadia, California,

Exam Process?

The Executive Committee reminds
students to cross out the printed
pledge on the outside of the Inde-
pendent exam envelope and to sub-
stitute the standard pledge in its
place.

“On my honor as a W&L student,
I have not given or received aid in
taking this test.”

At the time which they have indi-
cated they will be taking the exam,
students should report to the place
designated by their instructor to pick
up their exam envelopes.

When they finish the exam, stu-
dents should place the exam and
their answers into the envelope and
return it to the place of issue.

Courses that have set examina-
tion periods are listed on the ODK
Board.

Students who are late for an exam
should not expect additional time be-
yond the point of termination,

Students should remenyber that the

UC Runoff Planned;
EC Defeats Motion
To Curtail Posters

Last evening the EC reversed an
earlier decision and scheduled runoff
elections for Sophomore and Junior
repersentatives to the University
council. Junior Don Weir moved
that the two contested seats be decid-
ed by an election the first Wednes-
day after the Spring Term begins.
This motion passed 10-1 with Sta-
man Ogilvie in opposition.

Originally the EC had decided the
winners by a coin toss. There was a
tie for third place in the Junior class
race and also a tie for second place
in the Sophomore class. The Univer-
sity Council is scheduled to meet to-
morrow, so the BC felt that there
was not sufficient time for a runoff.

dent Body Phil Thompson moved

THE RING-TUM PHI

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

 

March 30, 1971

October 6, 1971?

The independent examinations scheduled for this Decem-
ber were cancelled two days ago by the faculty, in case you
hadn't noticed the headline on the front page.

In a three hour meeting, the faculty resolved that the De-
cember examinations would be conducted under the old system
which was used previous to the 1970-71 school year.

Surprised? We're not. Last year’s minor crisis before winter
term exams contained the kernel of the debate which has flour-
ished over the independent exams ever since.

For the record, the EC at first attempted to codify the
pledge on the exam envelope in order to mollify certain mem-
bers of the faculty who were concerned—and perhaps rightly
so—with the proliferation of comments about the fall exams
in December of 1970.

The EC then reversed its field and arrived at the conclusion
that any pledge other than the one used on all other work at
W&L would be in the form of a “contract.” So the pledge for
the winter exams was the normal one.

But, fortunately, even this attempt at leaving the pledge of
Honor open without a “no comment” rule did not prevent in-
stances of comments during the exam period. The EC was not
happy. Neither was the faculty. And now, after the death of
independent exams, the students aren't very pleased with the
outcome, either.

Last year’s student body president, Fran Lawrence, wrote
the following in this newspaper before the April exams began.

“Probably some comments about examinations do not give
any aid—they would not be a violation of the Honor System.

“This must be decided on an individual basis. We all have
to make a special effort, however, not to give information on
the exam to a student who has not taken the same exam. It
creates a predicament for everyone involved.

“The easiest policy is to keep our mouths completely shut.
Another reason for this is that, although some comments on
examinations may not be Honor Violations, they may cause
the Independent Exam program to be dropped.

“The faculty, understandably, would prefer that no com-
ments whatsoever be made about the finals.

“Keeping silent will work to insure that we keep the ad-
vantage of scheduling our own examinations.”

Well, the freedom of the independent examinations is dead.
And the cries of dismay which followed Monday's action by
the faculty are utterly absurd: the students have only them-
selves to blame. They had best, as Fran Lawrence bluntly put
it, keep their “mouths completely shut.”

If students cannot live up to the responsibilities involved in
an independent exam program, then they have little privilege
to the freedom it provides. Last Monday's formal passing of
the independent exams into oblivion was only an after-thought.
The students themselves killed the idea a long time ago.

Pes

We hope that we'll never have to read an editorial like this
one again.

Call It In The Air...

Captain Robertson, this is captain Merchant.
Captain Merchant, this is captain Robertson.
Captain Merchant will you call it in the air?

Is this scene from the pre-game ceremony of the Super
Bowl? No, it is a scene from an election—W&L style.

It seems that the election yesterday for undergraduate
members of the newly formed University Council almost de-
generated into a game of chance. Here are the facts. Three rep-
resentatives were to be elected to the UC from the upcoming
Junior class. There was a tie for third place; both Greg Robert-
son and Bill Merchant received 76 votes. A similar event oc-
curred in the Sophomore election where Amshoff, Stein, and
Hartmann were dead-locked for the second seat on hat body.

The EC decided for the sake of expediency to omit a run
off election. In its place the winners were to be selected by lot.
The four candidates were summoned by the EC and told to call
“heads or tails.” The candidates did not exactly agree to the
procedure but “they did not object” as one EC member so
eloquently put it,

Last evening at the EC meeting Staman Ogilvie explained
that, “after you watch the polls for 76 elections, you get a little
tired of runoffs. Let the new EC decide who should be on the
University Council.”

Mr. Ogilvie might do well to read the Student Body Con
stitution. No where in that document is coin flipping or for
that matter any form of lottery approved as the proper proce
dure for selecting officers.

But wait, there is a happy ending to this little story
Weir came to the rescue and noted some of the irregularities of

the “election” and asked for a runoff between the candidates
His motion to that effect passed 10-1. So March 21 Mr. Mer
chant will face Mr. Robertson and Mr. Stein will face off with
Mr. Amshoff and Mr. Hartman in an election

So another tradition (coin flipping) bites the dust

Foreign Study Program Begins

One of the most educationally
valuable of a whole array of new
programs begins this month when
23 students and three professors
leave for Europe in the School's first
“study abroad” program of its own.

The foreign study program itself
is not new, not even at Washington
and Lee. Other colleges have had
them for years, and through coopera-
tive arrangements students have al-
ways been able to take advantage of
them.

But the way the university has de-
signed its own program has, in the
eyes of its participants, led to unique
new opportunities, with a degree of
individual flexibility an dcompre-
hensiveness few other programs can
match,

To be sure, plenty of foreign-lang-
uage and European history majors
will be going to France or Germany
or Spain. That isn’t unusual. The
‘basic idea behind study-abroad pro-
grams has always ‘been to give stu-
dents first-hand experience with lan-
guage and culture and history.

But the program doesn’t stop
there. In addition to students from
the fields one would expect, there
will be majors in the sciences, in
commerce, even in American history
and English. A few sophomore par-
ticipants, in fact, haven't even de-
cided on a major yet.

The idea is simple. There is more
—much more—than “just” language
and culture that can be learned bet-
ter On the spot than in a textbook or
lecture.

The participating students’ indivi-
dual projects are as imaginative as

the program, and as diverse as the
students themselves. Where, for in-
stance, is the best place to research

Renaissance Study Sets
Varied Lecture A genda

Almost unnoticed among the many
new offerings in this year's catalogue,
Interdepartmental 303 signals a new
departure in teaching methods for
WA&L.

The subject matter of the course is
the Renaissance and the approach
has been determined to a great ex-
tent by the previous studies and the
interests of those registered for the
course.

Each week a talk will be offered,
followed the next day by a group dis-
cussion of the material presented in
the lecture. Then each participant
will choose a phase of the subject
discussed and prepare a paper on it.
A seminar type meeting will be used
later in the week, the papers read
and discussed by all in the course.

Lectures will be given by mem-
bers of five departments of Washing.
ton & Lee and two visitors from
other universities, cach presenting
his or her own views on the specific
subject under discussion.

Among the topics scheduled for
drscussion are the history of the
Renaissance period by Mr. Sanders
of the History Departmen, the re
vival of the interest in man in Re
naissance art by Dr. Doyon of the
Fine Arts Department, and one on
scientific thinking in the Renaissance
by Dr. Turner of the Physics Depar!
ment,

In addition, a talk on protest in
the literature of the Renaissance will
be given by Mrs. Jo Ann Church,
formerly of Fisk University, and one
by Mrs. Anna Otien of Antioch Col
lege dealing with the quest for iden
tity during the Renaissance

The lectures will be given on Mon
days during the Spring Term, ex
cept for one to be given on Tuesday
April 20 by Dr. W. W. Johnson of
the Spanish Department on the urge

toward geographical expansion and
discovery.

All lectures are open to the pub-
lic, and students are invited even
though they may not be taking the
course for credit, Dr. Arthur Scharff
of the Romance Language Depart-
ment is directing the course and
more specific information may be
obtained from him.

It is planned to offer a similar
treatment of the Middle Ages next

year.

If a student’s academic interests
lie in identifying and analyzing the
influences that acted upon foreign
‘writers and dramatists, especially
men whose works have had major
impact in America, there is nothing
that can take the place of a first-

terested in international economics,

between European and American

ter how good a library is, it’s second-
best, behind personal, scholarly field
investigation.

Other representative projects which
students will undertake during their

include studies of music, historical
life-styles, sociological patterns, and
research in chemistry, mathematics
and other natural sciences,

With Malice Toward Some

Caps and Gowns

BY JEFFREY B. SPENCE

It appears that Washington and
Lee is going to bid farewell to quite
a number of its seniors this year in
a most unpleasant way.

As a result of a decision by the
Faculty Executive Committee any
student who desires to participate in
the commencement exercises on
June 4 must wear “appropriate aca-
demic garb—"in other words, cap
and gown.

Recently I went to the Dean of
Students to inquire about whether
one might participate in the com-
mencement exercises in a suit and
donate the money for the cap and
gown to the S.W.M.S.F.C. The Dean
pointed out to me that one does not
have to attend the ceremony to “gra-
duate.”

The ceremony, according to the
Dean of Students and the assistant
Dean of the College, is to be attend-
ed on a strictly voluntary basis. The
Dean of Students went as far as to
describe the ceremony as “Mickey
Mouse” so as to allay any distress
I might have over not attending.
There is no penalty for nonatten-
dance, according to the administra-
tion.

No penalty? Well, that és not ex-
wotly true. Hf one of the seniors opts
for the voluntary choice not to at-
tend he is not allowed to receive his
diploma until sometime next Octo-
ber. Is that not a penalty? | think it
is.

Last May a precedent was set
when some 10 to 20 percent of the
graduating seniors attended
the commencement exercises in suits
rather than the traditional cap and

gown. There was no hue and cry
raised as a result then nor has there
been any since then. Why is it not
to be allowed this year?

The answer to this question comes
from Dean Watt who claims that it
would break down the uniformity of
the ceremony.

The stated policy of this school is
its emphasis on the individual per-
son. If this is true then what place
does uniform regimentation such as
Dean Watt describes have at Wash-
ington and Lee? I certainly hope
that uniformity is not what we are
‘being groomed for here.

If the University really means to
live up to its policy of no penalty if
one opis not to attend the gradua-
tion ceremony then it ought to allow
a student to pick up his diploma im-
mediately following it. In fact, I
see no reason whatsoever that a stu-
dent who desires to participate in
the commencement exercise on June
4 should be prevented from doing
SO just because he does not wear a
cap and gown.

| hope that my fellow students
who desire to participate in this up-
coming graduation ceremony but are
without a cap and gown will let
their voices be heard by the Faculty
E.C. and the Administration.

Furthermore, those students who
opt to not attend, for whatever rea-
son, should demand that they receive
their diplomas on the same day as
those who do attend the ceremony.
Washington and Lee must certainly
have room within itself to accomo-
date more than just the wishes of the
Faculty Exeoutive Committee and
its Deans. Think it over. Peace.

‘Base of Lunacy’

BY MARC SMALL

In this age of camp causes and
these many “pressing concerns” that
appear one day, flame for a mere
second, and are forgotten even while
Madison Avenue commervializes
them for the middle class, it is per
haps inevitable that the activists
should slip through increasingly silly
protests until they reach the ultimate
base of lunacy

While I hardly find that they have
accomplished the latter, I do find
the current browhaha over “welfare
rights,” for all its relevaney, so con-
tradictory as to be thoroughly ridi
culous

When a person, whether from nec
essily or from sloth, places himself
on the dole, he sacrifices his prero
gatives as a free agent. For all the
legal safeguards in our political sys
tem, 4 person on welfare has siill
made himself a slave to the system in
its slates quo form, and must-—dor
the of his srvival—play the
role of a staunch Opponent of any
ind all change that will threaten his
continued supply of thal government
money he receives

great extent,

It has become axiomatic to our

Stickmen Ranked Seventh

BY RAY SWAN

After gaining a ranking of 7th in
the nation the W&L lacrosse team
beat Dartmouth last Wednesday 13-3
to earn a 3-0 record so far this sea-
son.

The Generals dominated the game
from the start, shutting out the In-
dians for three quarters. Bill In-
gersoll and the defense combined
for their best effort so far.

Sam Englehart started the scoring

for the Generals with about eleven

minutes left in the first quarter.
Hank Glausson scored next to give
the Blue a 2-0 lead. Englehart scor-
ed his second goal with five minutes
left, and again with only 41 sec-
onds left. Bob Brumback recorded
a goal twelve seconds later to give
W&L a 5-0 lead at the end of the
first quarter.

The second quarter saw less ac-
tion. Englehart got his fourth goal

Davies Hopes For Tennis Title

Washington and Lee's tennis team
had a very successful year last sea-
son, but apparently that’s not quite
good enough for new head coach
Tom Davies.

The Generals posted a 10-2 won-
lost record, but slipped to a lowly
fourth-place finish in the College
Athletic Conference tournament, an
event they had won the previous
three years.

“Let's just say I definitely expect
this year’s team to contend for the
championship,” commented Davies,
the W&L assistant basketball coach
who has now added the tennis team
to his duties.

Davies has the horses to work
with. The top four players from last
year all return, led by senior team
captain Bill Gatlin, along with no. 2

man Stan Taylor, no. 3 Marshall
Washiburn and no, 4 Jeff Driscoll.

Close behind them are three non-
lettermen—Steve Swenson, Lee Thal-
heimer and Dave Gilbert—and a trio
of top-notch freshmen: Tim Thomp-
son, Greg Barker and Bo Hobson.

Any one of them could move into
the top six places, according to
Coach Davies. And there are sev-
eral more “pretty decent” freshmen
waiting in the wings as well.

The 1971 net Generals face an ex-
panded schedule with several tough
opponents, among them Duke, Vir-
ginia, Virginia Tech and William &
Mary. Also included is a Southern
Spring Trip in which W&L will take
on Duke, Emory University, Rollins
and Florida Presbyterian on succes-
sive days.

of the afternoon midway through
the period. Ted Bauer closed out the
half’s scoring, scoring a goal ‘with
only 48 seconds left. The Blue left
the field at halftime with a 7-0 lead.

It took W&L only 38 seconds to
score in the third quarter. Tim Win-
field recorded a goal to start another
five-goal spree. Captain Whit Morrill
scored one and Englehart scored
two in less than thirty seconds. The
General's lead stood at 12-0 after
Skip Lichtfuss closed out the scor-
ing, getting a goal with only 37 sec-
onds left in the quarter.

In the fourth quarter, co-captain
Scott Neese scored the Generals’
lone goal. Dartmouth scored all
three of its goals in this period. The
Generals were able to substitute free-
ly, and Skeeter Chadwick took over
for Ingersoll in the crease.

Dartmouth’s All-American attack-
man Mike Diaz was held to a single
goal. The Indians seemed to have
trouble with fundamentals, and
could not develop any kind of consis-
tent attack. The Generals continued
their hard body-checking.

The game against East Carolina,
scheduled for last Saturday morning,
was cancelled because of snow. The
Generals do not play at home again
until May 8, against Loyola of Balti-
more. They have a full away sche-
dule until then, however, including
games with Wesleyan, Connecticut,
and Navy during Spring vacation.

test beating Shepard 7842-6842 but
dropped the battle with Bridgewater
92-53. On Thursday ACC power
Wake Forest handed its second loss
in three outings.

Times were generally bad and
competition not too keen Tuesday,
both as a result of the time of the
season and condition of the track.
Sharp March winds and sub-50 tem-
peratures made it tough for anyone
to get sufficiently warmed up and
loose, much less anywhere near peak
shape for the season's first meet.
Also, as anyone who has played ten-
nis on the gravel courts under the
“world’s longest foot bridge of its
kind in the world” knows, the track
was in less than great shape—slow,
loose and peppered with those un-
expected mounds.

There were, however, bright spots
and outstanding individual perfor-
mances. Most notable of efforts were
those of sophomore Paul Suthern.
The lanky Connecticut Yankee ran
and jumped for three firsts Tuesday
and tallied another Thursday against
Wake Forest before pulling up lame
with tendon trouble. He took the
high hurdies in a time of 15.4, the
440 intermediate hurdles in 64.9,
and finally won the long jump with a
20 foot, 7 inch leap. Suthern also
took first again in the highs against
Wake Forest but, in so doing, devel-

oped leg trouble and was through
for the rest of the afternoon.

As expected, the major area of
Blue strength was in the field. A
sweep of the high jump by Frank
Porter, John Glace, and Dave Stone
was the most noteworthy of the field
contests. Glace also added points in
the shot, long jump and javelin, fin-

New Foreign Study Plan Begins

the primary requirement for partici-
pating in the study-abroad program.
Students had to arrange with an ap-
propriate academic department to
receive credit for their overseas
work, too, since after all the pro-
gram is a part of the university's
curriculum, not a holiday.

Students—and the professors who
will ‘be serving as their tutors and
advisors in Europe—also had to
come up with the whole cost of the
term abroad,

But that is only the tip of the ice-
berg. Making arrangements for the
program was an incredibly time-
consuming, complex, and even at

times frustrating task, according to
Prof. David B. Dickens of the uni-
versity’s German department, chair-
man of the foreign study committee
and leader of the German group.

Together with his counterparts in
French and Spanish, Drs, G. Francis
Drake and S. J. Williams, he had to
go to Europe (again at his own ex-
pense) last summer to make living
and teaching arrangements. Students
and faculty will live with individual
German, French and Spanish fami-
lies, giving the program another edu-
cational advantage.

Generally, students in the program
will take regular classes while in
Europe, “borrowing” the facilities of
major universities there. Their own
projects will be reserved for their
free time, in the same way individual
projects are undertaken “back home”
at Washington and Lee.

At the end of their Buropean stay,
each student will be required to sub-
mit a thesis, reporting the results of
his European research. Then he'll re-
ceive six hours of class credit, the
same amount being earned by his
colleagues who remain in Lexington.

The group leaves Monday, April
19. Most of the participants will re-
turn the first week of June, (The
seniors will have to. They graduate
June 4.)

A number, however, will stay in
Europe through the summer—still
another added advantaoge of the
unique Washington and Lee pro-
gram. With the “short term” com-
ing at the end of the academic year
instead of in the middle as it does at
almost every other college, there is
nothing to keep them from remain-
ing to continue their work. Already,
before they have even begun, four
or five have said they plan to stay in
Europe.

The French group will be head-
quartered in Paris, the Spanish in
Madrid, and the German in Bay-
reuth. Bringing a Lexington custom
with them, the grouips will use week-
ends for extensive travelling.

Mahan Awards Offered
(Continued from Page 1)

cipients of the awards receive $100
tuition or $60 cash.

Entries may be submitted in one
or more of four categories: fresh-
man, sophomore, and junior Prose,
and poetry. The total awards in any
one year may not exceed five, and
awards are made only when the en-
tries achieve a level of excellence re-
quired by a committee of judges in
the Department of English.

Further details and instructions
concerning the contest may be ob-
tained in Payne Hall, where the en-
tries ate to be submitted.

erected a welfare structure which de-
grades free men and, for the sake of
a meal, turns them into the paid
lackies of the system.

If we are to have a dole, it should
ibe done in such a way that those in-
volved in it would not become those
most concerned in its retention or
expansion, The Hatch Act prohibts
Civil Servants from involving them-
selves in partisan political activity,
the several “conflict-of-interest” laws
provide that no official may involve
himself in some area of govern-
mental action in which he is private-
ly involved: would it not be reason-
able to likewise prohibit those on the
dole from participating in the poli-
tical arena?

Such an act as this might not only
preserve the political integrity of our
system but might well indeed inypress
upon those concerned he truly ser-
vile nature of their dole.

My “Webster's Seventh New Col-
legiate Dictoonary” gives as any ex-
ample of an oxymoron the phrase
“cruel kindness;” in light of the liber-
ties lost in return for seourity, it is
certainly appropriate to speak of that
oxymoronic blindness, welfare rights,
as the harshest of all “cruel kind-
ness.”

Weir which put the election into a
run-off. At any rate our desires and
needs are clear.

Wednesday of this week law stu-
dents will once again be asked to
vote on an important issue, We must
decide whether we want one year
terms for SBA officers and a cor-
respondingly more effective SBA or
if we want to remain with semester
officers who are partially paralyzed
by lack of time and incentive. The
choice appears clear—to remain as
we are is unworkable and inefficient.
We are the only law school out of
the nine others in our circuit which
has semester officers.

When I ran for SBA office I stated
that I viewed this semester as a time
for housecleaning. Having already
settled the matter of dues, I think
that a vote for one year terms for
SBA officers would put our house in
good order, and go a long way to-
ward making the SBA a more vib-
rant and effective force-in the Uni-
versity and the community, All I ask
is that you think wbout it and then
vote.
