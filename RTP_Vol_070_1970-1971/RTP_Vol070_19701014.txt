Telephone Tax
For Residents
In City Limits

BY JOHN ROBINSON

Have you ever looked closely at
your telephone bill? With a bit of
scrutiny, you would notice your
“local tax” total. This represents
a City of Lexington tax on local
rates and services.

The City Council approved this
tax June 20, 1968 to increase its
sources of income. As the ordinance
is written, only local services and
rates are subject to taxation. A maxi-
mum of 20% can be levied on local
expenditures of $10 on personal
phones and $50 on business phones.

Dale C. Ramey, local manager
for the Virginia Telephone and
Telegraph Company, explained that
most private student phones require
a flat rate of $6.50 every month.
This results in a local tax of $1.30.

lt is important to remember this
tax does not apply to long distance
calls. However, service charges such
as installation of extension phones
would be subject to taxation.

Guy B. Agnor, Lexington City
Manager, said, “This telephone tax
only rarely reaches its maximum of
$10. On the other hand, gas and
electricity taxes often reach their
maximums due to the seasonal de-
mands for these services.”

Agnor also revealed that this tele-
phone tax makes a substantial con-
tribution to the city budget. Last
year the city anticipated $130,000 in
revenue from this particular tax.
The actual revenue was $136,353.
This sum was deposited in the gen-
eral fund. This amount of money
was approximately 11% of the city
government's revenue.

How does Lexington’s rate com-
pare with other local telephone tax
rates? For the Commonwealth of
Virginia Lexington’s rate is high.
According to Tax Rates in Virginia
Cities and Urban Counties, 1968 by
Donald C. Dixon, only one city in
Virginia (Alexandria) has a higher
rate, Nonetheless, Lexington does
have a maximum which is not true
in many localities.

So, if you are upset by the size
of your phone bill, maybe you can
take pride in the fact Lexington’s
general fund has benefited by your
sucrifices,

EC Appointed Group

Investigates Car Tax

BY RITA ENNIS

The Legal Aid and Research Com-
mittee of the Law School has been
commissioned by the Executive
Committee to study the required
Lexington automobile license tags
for students.

After last week refusing to take a
stand on the issue, the EC in its
Monday night meeting unanimously
requested the Research Committee
to determine the exact legal points of
the ordinance, to present a memor-
andum to the EC as soon as possible,
and, if necessary, to begin proced-
ings for a class suit on behalf of all
out-of-state students.

The EC also heard a progress re-
port from Dan Silberberg concern-
ing the 1972 Mock Democratic Con-
vention, named members to the
Honor System Subcommittee and
passed changes in the Conference
Fund Committee.

Discussion regarding the license
tag ordinance began following a re-
quest made by junior John O'Neal.
In his statement, O'Neal asked the
EC to take a definite stand on the
ordinance. He stated that aside from
legal grounds, the ordinance was “in-
herently unjust.” Discussion follow-
ed which ultimately led to the com-
missioning of the Legal Aid and Re-
search Commitiece. Action on
O'Neil’s request was postponed un-
til the Research Committee issues
its memorandum.

See Letter to the Editor, Page 2,

Silberberg, in his report, refuted
The Ringtum Phi editorial of last
week. He stated that he was far
ahead of Steve Saunders (1968 Mock
Convention Chairman) in prepara-
tion and money requests for the
Convention. (Silberberg had earlier
spoken with Saunders to verify this.)
In his progress report Silberberg not-
ed that information pamphlets were
ready for printing as soon as funds
ure available, The EC unanimously
approved a $50 allocation for im-
mediate Operating expenses.

Vice President Phil Thompson an-
nounced the membership of the
Honor System Subcommittee. In ad-
dition to Thompson and EC mem-
bers Don Weir and Chris Jones, 13
members were appointed to the Sub

Interfraternity
Council Studies
Food Buying

Tuesday night's Inter-Fraternity
Council meeting saw the culmina-
tion of the effort to coordinate the
cooperative food buying plan for the
fraternities. The IFC has been check-
ing with all the houses over the past
few weeks to compare prices and
sound out the reactions of the house-
mothers and cooks,

Several fraternities demonstrated
reluctance to go along with the plan,
the chief reason being that they felt
that they would not save that much
money and the effort would not be
justified unless a considerable sum
was saved. There was also some re-
luctance on the part of several
houses to cooperate as they felt that
they would lose money in the ven-
ture, especially when Mr. Jerry Dar-
rell’s services would be recompensed
at the rate of $5 per house per week

The chief worry of those fraterni
ties who favored the plan was the
reserve fund, which with fifteen
houses cooperating would come to
$200 per house. If there was a signi
ficant reduction in the number of
houses participating, the amount
required from each house would in
crease, Bruce Madison, treasurer of

the Beta house, stated that he
couldn't see tying up three or four
hundred dollars when people
wouldn't go into the plan

After long discussion, the plan
was passed by the IFC, A meeting

will be held Thursday night in the
Student Union with the cooks and
housemothers present to discuss im
plementation of the plan

Bruce Madison, Social Chairman
of the IFC, announced plans to ac
cumulate data from the houses on
the combos that they have used in
the past, focusing primarily on book
ing agencies, combo ratings, and
prices so that a cross-reference
guide may be made available to al!

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Rubbin

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
OCTOBER 14, 1970

«> Whatever Happened To
The Ring-tum Phi?

Last week someone complained about The Ring-tum Phi.
We wish this fact were noteworthy enough to be placed on
page one with a banner headline. But, as we know only too
well, the odds are better on someone’s vocal disgruntlement
with the newspaper than they are on the outside chance the sun
won't rise tomorrow.

So if complaints about an opinion, or poor copy, or typos,
or a missing notice, or poor pictures, or lack of coverage, or
bad headlines, or a ridiculous name aren't anything new, what
makes this year’s expression of malcontent different from that
of any other year? We believe a large portion of the objections
about The Ring-tum Phi are based implicitly on the words
which now appear under our mast on page one: “Washington
and Lee University’s Weekly Newspaper.”

The glorious eras of The Tuesday and Friday Ring-tum
Phis were ended by the Publications Board last year due to
rising publication costs and insufficient funds in the Publica-
tions Board budget to meet the higher price of two news-
papers. Neither editorial boards of the newspapers were pleas-
ed about the merger; the Publications Board effected the
change only out of necessity. The Ring-tum Phi, its editors and
readership have been simply caught in the common ailment of
the day—the inflationary grip.

We seriously question whether one weekly newspaper can
serve the needs of the Washington and Lee community of
students, faculty, administration, parents, and alumni. Witness
the following six points which were cited in an article on the
merger appearing in The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi January 13,
1970:

“Six general reasons were cited in the [Publications
Board's] subcommittee report for recommending consolidation
of the two Ring-tum Phis. They are as follows:

“1. The consolidation of the two present staffs would
improve the overall qaulity [sic] of the writing in the paper,
since more time would be devoted to writing and editing
copy.

“2. The paper would serve its readers better by provid-
ing enhanced coverage of newsworthy events.

“3. The danger of being understaffed during the short-
term periods would be lesser with an enlarged staff.

“4. The increasing cost of publishing The Ring-tum
Phi; a six page edition would show a savings.

“5. Problems of distribution and readership of the Fri-
day Edition (because of the five-day class week) would be
obviated with a Thursday Edition.

“6. These recommendations would enhance the status
of working on The Ring-tum Phi both as Editor and especi-
ally as an underclassman. Understaffing has become an in-
creasingly difficult problem over the past few years.”

Of all of the above reasons for the merger then, we can see
only one which is valid—one weekly saves money. As for the
other cited reasons, we cannot seriously reject the timeliness of
two newspapers a week for the elusive term “quality” in one
weekly edition (although it may be appropriate at this point
to note that the publishing date for The Ring-tum Phi is
Wednesday, thus making it somewhat more timely). Staffing
has not been any problem for the newspaper this year, and we
suspect that were there two editions, adequate staffs could be
had for both. Distribution of the Friday Edition would be
simpler if the newspaper went to press earlier in the day, thus
setting its deadlines back several hours into Thursday.

And finally we come to our main objection to one news-
paper—the forum for opinion and space for the presentation
of news is cut by approximately 25 percent. This tends not to
be a good thing for the editors of one edition who receive
criticism from members of the community because an article
was not printed due to lack of space. And it also makes it even
more difficult for an editor to attempt to capture as many of
the divergent points of view as there are people on this camp-
us. But most important of all, the readership of the newspaper
suffers ; and frankly, we see little hope of accomplishing what
eight pages did in the past within our present six pages, Not
that it can't be done. It just can't be done as well.

The Ring-tum Phi presently receives $3.18 from each stu-
dent via the student tax yielding a total of $4,452 in revenue
from 1400 students. Cost of the newspaper you're now hold-
ing? $275 an issue, or $8425 for the year. Approximately 20
percent of the rest of the total will be defrayed by subseriptions
and the remaining 30 percent will be covered by advertisers.
The estimated price of two four page editions for this year
is $10,200, and the difference between the two costs is $1,775,

To finance two newspapers, The Ring-tum Phi needs at least
$4.18 from each student. The difference of $375 can be met by
slightly increasing advertising space (which is, due to space
demands at present, the smallest we've seen in contrast to
other college newspapers in the area), The increase of $1 in the
student tax may sound ludicrous (and is impossible) this year,
but surely not for next year.

In the meantime, we see only one possible measure which
could be taken to allow The Tuesday and Friday Ring-tum
Phis to be resurrected this year: the Executive Committee
could appropriate enough funds to the Publications Board to
cover the cost of printing two Ring-tum Phis each week, They
could and should,

BY JOE TOMPKINS

“When in charge, ponder; when in
trouble, delegate; when in doubt,
mumble.”

This is the motto of the National
Association of Professional Bureau-
crats, a group which supplies its
members with executive pencils with
erasers on ‘both ends and which
stands ready to help get you back to
a confused and furious standstill.

The Association speaks in jest,
but on the basis of what the aver-
age citizen sees of the bureaucracy,
the above statements are not beyond
belief.

This summer I had the experience
of living with over 40 super-grade
federal executives (GS 16, 17, and
18) the “head” bureaucrats, for
eight weeks, and it was a truly mean-
ingful session. Along with three
other undergraduates from the Uni-
versity of South Dakota, the Uni-
versity of Nevada, and San Jose
State College, California, respective-
ly, I was chosen to be one of the
first undergraduates to attend the
Federal Executive Institute in Char-
lottesville, Virginia. Our participa-
tion was sponsored by the Ford
Foundation.

The FEI is a residential institute
which has been in existence for two
years. It is concerned with Executive
Development and seeks to contribute
to more effective leadership perfor-
mance by executives in two ways: by
strengthening individual capabilities
and by giving a better understanding
of the leadership role.

The executives in my session were
from a broad spectrum of govern-
ment agencies including Transporta-
tion, CIA, Post Office, Interior, NSA,
Treasury, NASA, HUD, Commerce,
National Park Service, and the mili-
tary services. Typically, the partici-
pants were between 45 and 55 years
old, had been in the civil service for
15 to 20 years, lived in comfortable
homes in the suburbs and had col-
lege, and sometimes graduate de-
grees.

We were all participants in a
learning community in which execu-
tive undergraduates and faculty
members were all viewed as equals.
We were all “students” and soon
found that, indeed, we could all
learn from one another. The educa-
tional methods included seminars,
lectures, discussion field trips, and
group and individual study. Field
trips were taken to Ottawa, Canada,
Washington, D.C. and Richmond.

We had guest lecturers at least
three times a week, most of whom
were from the upper levels of the
executive and legislative branches of
government. The atmosphere was
casual and related and I found it
very conducive to education and
learning Recreation was an integral
part of the program. A daily volley-
ball game was conducted from 4-5:30
p.m. Considering the victims nature
of the competition, the injuries were
light: one broken knee, several
sprained ankles, and a few dislocated
fingers.

I write this article about my ex-
perience with a dual purpose ‘in
mind. First, | want to share my per-
ception of these men who hold im-

portant positions in the bureaucracy.
Secondly, I would like to express my
feelings as to how some of the con-
cepts of a real learning community
can ‘be applied to our university,

Living with a group of people for
eight weeks in succession allows one
to know and understand his collea-
gues well, so the comments I make
stem not from hasty observation. I
speak in generalizations and I should
make it clear that there are excep-
tions to what I say.

Typically, the government execu-
tive is devoted to his work, spend-
ing between 50-70 hours per week
doing his job. He is usually a spec-
ialist or technician in a specific area
and has little knowledge of events
taking place outside his bailiwick.

Most of these men share the char-
acteristics of tunnel-vision resistance
to change, a pragmatic practical ap-
proach to life and daily situations, a
loss of esthetic appreciation, and
very little empathy or sensitivity to
feelings whether they be their own or
those of others. To most, develop-
ment is measured in terms of moving
up the GS rating scale or receiving
a greater salary, with little or no
consideration given to spiritual, men-
tal educational, or creative develop-
ment.

Many executives bear great inse-
curity in regard to certain fundamen-
tal personal trats e.g. — ability to
communicate with others, ability to
be accepted by a group—and it ap-
pears that many have compensated
for this perceived deficiency by be-
coming experts or specialists in a
particular area in which they can be-
come the undisputed authority.
Whether the insecurity caused the
specialization or vice versa is not
clear, but I suspect it is the former.

Most executives feel an identity
with their job and are strong advo-
cates of their particular group or
agency. Politics and politicians are
particularly distasteful subjects for
most executives, for most of them
have appeared before congressional
appropriations committees and have
been outmaneuvered and sent away
disappointed. Realizing that they
must fight the politicians on their
terms, most executives seek actively
to learn the tactics and methods
necessary for combat in the political
arena.

I make these statements not as an
indictment of the federal executives,

for I think the word which best de- «

scribes my feeling toward them is
sympathy. I see most of these men
as having tried to do what they think
best and having attempted to im-
prove things around them when they
entered the civil service. However,
over the years, their attempts at in-
novations have been rebuffed and
they now bear so many battle scars
and have been knocked down so
many times that they feel it is use-
less to try further. They are “vic-
tims” in the sense that they have
been transformed from sensitive,
curious, creative individuals into in-
sensitive, mentally fatigued cogs in
a machine which makes a lot of
noise but which is not really operat-
ing properly.

| would like to turn briefly to the
subject of education and develop-

ing a learning community. A learn-
ing community, as I see it, is one in
which all the participants, whether
they are young or old, faculty or
non-faculty, seek to learn from one
another. To make this happen, con-
ditions surrounding a community
must be conducive to openness and
personal growth and supportive of
the learning process.

munity should be able to be both a
giver and a receiver of information

Each member of the learning com-
and knowledge. Certain members of
the community have much to offer
in the way of expertise, scholarship,
and experience, and their role is ac-
cepted as important, However, the
flow of knowledge should not be a
one way movement,

It is believed that each participant
in a learning community should
share in the import and evaluation of
that community. The essentials of a
learning community are: a climate
for the honest airing of differences of
views and the expression of one’s
true feelings and reactions; two-way
communication and feedback; self
awareness and support for building
on the strengths of each individual.

If these assumptions are granted,
then there are many implications

LETTERS TO

O’Neal Blasts Tax
In Letter To EC,

The Ring-tum Phi
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

In view of the tacit complacency
exhibited by the Executive Commit-
tee concerning the city of Lexing-
ton’s adoption of compulsory city li-
cense tags for all car-owning stu-
dents, I ask the E.C. to issue a state-
ment of its feelings in order to in-
form the student body of its posi-
tion.
Seemingly, the two members of
the E.C. present at the adoption ac-
quiesced to the license tags so that
the issue of the property tax could
be dropped until a later, more strate-
gic date. Seemingly again, they
merely accepted the lesser of the
two evils. I find this acceptance
more in the spirit of resignation
rather than in that of demanding
compromise.

The City of Lexington’s economic
dependence upon the student body of
Washington and Lee is quite appar-
ent. What need does the city have
which necessitates further exploita-
tion of the students? The sale of city
license tags, even in practicality,
could not bring in enough revenue
for the city alone to adequately re-
pair not only its roads but also those
frequented by students to and from
their rural apartments. The city
limits of Lexington are confined to
a relatively small area when com-
pared with the miles of road leading
into the town from many students’
apartments,

Moreover, students’ cars do not
wear the city’s roads as much as the
large trucks which incessantly pass
through the middle of town. Truck-
ing companies rightfully must pay

Towards ‘Maturation’ Of Education

BY LEX MeMILLAN
Curriculum Committee

In May of this year there was an
overt display of activism never be-
fore matched at W&L. Now we are
back to school and it seems that a
considerable cooling down has oc-
curred during the summer. In some
respects this is good since the heated
emotions of last May hampered
clear thought for many. However,
the spirit of dynamism was good and
should not be allowed to slip away
while it can be used for constructive
ends.

The Curriculam Committee is
totally comprised of students and is
set up to deal with an important
area of student responsibility at
Washington and Lee. There are sev-
eral plans now under study by the
committee which we would like to
see enacted this year and which
would give to students more respon-
sibility and right to self-government,

One important plan is io set up a
teacher-course evaluation booklet
which would hopefully give the stu
dent body a more accurate view of
what a course is intended to do,
what the instructors’ approach is to
the course, and how well he accom-
plishes his plan. There will be in-
cluded in this booklet commenis
from students who have had the
course and the breakdown of the
grades given by the professor, lt is
obvious that this could prevent some
inequities that have occurred in the
past, as well as be a source of in-
formation.

Through this, students would have
a more knowledgeable baw for
course selection. Another aspect of

this is to set up a Student Course
and Grade Review Panel. This would
be a source of appeal to which the
students could carry complaints.
These sources of student informa-
tion and appeal would put the stu-
dents in a more advantageous bar-
gaining position when dealing with
problems encountered in academic
matters. This Board could be parti-
cularly beneficial with “I” grades
now completed. It is little secret that
some professors have emotionally
biased feelings toward those who
took “T's.”

Another source of student involve-
ment is the setting up of a liason
committee in every department com-
posed of students majoring in that
department. This committee would
sit in on all meetings of the depart-
ment as non-voting members. They
would have the ability in that posi-
tion to express student opinion on
issues concerning that department
and the majors. It is hoped that this
liason committee could have a hand
in interviewing prospective new
members of the department, setting
up mew courses. revising old ones,
setting requirements for majors and
generally assuming responsibility for
matters which directly concern them-
selves,

This type of liason committee has
already been started on a rudimen-
tary basis in the Sociology depart.
ment. As the number of majors has
grown it has become increasingly
necemary to make this committee
more formal and functional.

As has been seen in the experi-
mental stages, this type of commit
tee can be a beneficial source of in

formation, aid and innovation with-
in the department. It is an oppor-
tunity for students to have a greater
hand in regulating their own futures.
It is hoped that upperclassmen will
begin taking steps to set up this type
of liason committee within their de-
partments. It is also hoped that they
will meet with cooperation on the
part of the faculty. This can be an-
other important step in the develop.
ment and maturation of our educa-
tional system,

g Elbows With Bureaucrats

for the educational setting at Wash-
ington and Lee and at most other
institutions of higher learning. Ad-
mittedly, this concept of a learning
community just described presents a
model or ideal which may be impos-
sible to emulate fully.

However, the size and the setting
of Washington and Lee make me
hopeful that the improvements that
are needed can be made and that the
ideal is at least approachable. What
is needed is a re-thinking of what a
university should be and, conse-
quently, what the roles of the partici-
pants in that university should be,
whether they be faculty, administra-
tion, or students.

In my view, the relationship of
the participants should be one of
cooperation, Openness, and shared
concern in seeking to learn. If they
are practices which inhibit this type
of relationship it seems to me they
should be modified or laid aside. My
Observations are made not in an at-
tempt to pass judgment or censure,
but rather, from a feeling of concern
for this university and for those
bureaucrats whom I have mentioned.
The need to look at ourselves and
decide where we are going has
never been greater,

THE EDITOR

for the wakes left by their trucks,
Yet this money does not go directly
to Lexington for road improvement.
if Lexington wants so desperately
to improve its roads, it should justi-
fiably turn to the state to which the
money from taxes goes.

However, the city has already
shown its indifference towards road
improvement, by not even stipulat-
ing that the revenue from the sale of
tags would go towards road improve-
ment! I thoroughly question the City
of Lexington’s motives not only con-
cerning the license tax, but also con-
cerning the property tax. The stu-
dent-town relationship was previous-
ly favoring them disproportionately.
Students take from the town much
less than what the town reaps from
them. With the license tax and the
property tax, the City of Lexington
desires to swing the already askew
see-saw even more its way. Where
will this all end?

Without the support of the Execu-
tive Committee, any concerted fight
against these two taxes will flounder.
I urge you to adamately take a posi-
tion against both these taxes. Be-
cause the property tax is not as im-
minent as the license tax at this time,
I have not stated much of a case
against it. However, I believe that
both of the taxes can be dealt with
simultaneously. They both appear
inherently unjust to me.

Proposal:

That the Executive Committee
issue a statement of its convictions
and that this statement be formally
announced to all students by what-
ever means the Executive Commit-
tee choses.

That if the above statement is
favorable with what I have herein
expressed, that the Executive Com-
mittee stand by it and assume the
defense of the student body of Wash-
ington and Lee in the face of the ac-
tions of the City of Lexington con-
cerning the license tax and the pro-
perty tax.

That the Executive Committee
should immediately cali for a boy-
cott of the present license tax.

That students who have already
purchased City license tags be reim-
bursed by the City of Lexington.

That the Executive Committee call
a meeting with the City Council of
Lexington and state its case with a
clear preservation of its intentions
concerning the present license tax
and the pending property tax,

OCTOBER 14, 1970

 

BY GREG RAETZ

Now that the school year is under-
way and everyone has just about ac-
customed himself to classes beginn-
ing on a staggered schedule (start-
ing classes on the hour would have
been too simple), it is appropriate
once again to look at a question
which has been facing W&L for a
couple of years and which will,
hopefully, soon be answered. The
question is, of course, whether Wash-
ington and Lee should become co-
educational.

Much time and effort have been
consumed extolling the virtues of co-
education, but all too little have
been spent considering the problems
that would inevitably come with it.

Obviously the first problem that
arises is the economic cost of such
a move, and the fact is that to coedu-
cate W&L would be a very expen-
sive proposition. Even now dormi-
tory space is at a premium and the
addition of female students would
make it necessary to build more
dorms.

Expansion and/or remodeling
would also probably be necessary
for the dining hall and the gym. The
absolute costs of construction would
strain the W&L budget to say the
least, but the opportunity costs could
even be greater. How long would we
have to postpone the construction of
a new library, or the moving of the
Commerce School to its new build-
ing or any ofthe other improvements
which W&L needs to accommodate
properly its present enrollment.

Construction costs are not the
only economic problems which
would have to be solved. New fe-
male faculty members would have
to be recruited, hired and integrated

into the University. New funds for
scholarships would also have to be
obtained. W&L would have to seek
out new sources of income in order
to keep an endowment which would
allow it to remain competitive with
other schools in recruiting high qual-
ity students.

Furthermore, all of these changes
and additions would have to be
made without alienating alumni who
make a considerable contribution to
the solvency of the University each
year; and it seems likely that many
of the alumni would be bitterly alie-
nated by such a move. A man con-
tributes to something he knows and
believes in and as the institution
changes he has less in common with
it and his interest in it wanes. This
has been borne out by the experi-
ence of schools like Harvard who
have chosen to coeducate and it
doesn’t seem likely that Washington
and Lee would be an exception.
W&L would lose the support of
many once loyal alumni.

There are problems besides the
purely economic ones. Would a
change in the size of the University
adversely affect the student life?
Would it be necessary to fire some of
the instructors, e.g., in math and
the sciences, and add more in his-
tory and sociology? The changes
which these questions and others
like them imply are especially im-
portant because they involve chang-
ing the character of the University.

1 remember hearing or reading
somewhere that W&L offered a uni-
que educational experience; and |
have found that it does. Change is
inevitable, but the path to improve-
ment and achievement is not always
the most trodden one.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Markings.

BY BOB BAROODY

The pathological insanity of the
Nixon administration is once again
being exposed to the public view.
The occasion is, of course, the eve
of the November elections; no bet-
ter time to rally the nation against
that menace to human decency .. .
us. The problem is that, thus far,
students haven’t done anything. No
strikes, no bombings, no Kent States.
Some students actually watch foot-
ball games in October. To a sensible
person it would appear that Nixon
and his crew are wasting their
breath, We can’t even accuse the
president of overreacting; there is
simply nothing to react to,

Unfortunately, the above analysis
fails to acknowledge the fact that
when a man has been a politician
for nearly twenty-five years of his
life, he does not act as rationally as
some would wish. To perpetuate
yourself in power you need to be
crafty. You must be willing to sub-
vert reasonable thoughts to what a
social scientist might call a “game
mentality.” Richard Nixon, political
creature that he is, delights in play-
ing games. Consider his record:
everyone is familiar with “The Road
to Indochina;” some prefer “South-
ern Sweepstakes,” the fun domestic
game; and who can forget the built-
in thrills of “Middle East Show-
down?” Move the Sixth Fleet three
(free) world-squares and see what
the Russians do .

And now it’s time to play “Camp-
us Chaos.” The object of this game
is to incite and foment a student riot
through the use of the most offen-
sive tactics ever to be seen in this
country. To be considered a success,
this scheme must produce violence.

 

The Name Of The Game...

The president will then shift his at-
tention to something else: “Back-
lash,” a game of repression.

Thus, it is not difficult to under-
stand the rationale behind Nixon's
dark warning on the tube last month.
To underscore his point, Nixon sent
a ridiculous “Reader’s Digest” re-
print to university presidents: then,
in a most alarming gesture, he cried
to Congress for 1000 (more) FBI
agents to patrol our campuses. Spiro
Agnew typically hit the low road,
sputtering the alliterative asininities
spoon-fed to him by Nixon’s own
corps of  speechwriters. Agnew
would be a very funny person if he
were still a PTA president, but it so
happens that this madman can com-
mand first-page attention if he
sneezes. Most recently, as if “effete
snobs” were passing out of vogue,
John Mitchell added his great in-
sight; to the Attorney General we
are “those stupid bastards.”

All this is very heavy, It sounds
like a plot, and I believe Nixon's
student strategy to be exactly that.
But there is a way out; we don't
have to hear the administration or-
gasm, “I told you so!” Students can
refuse to play Nixon’s sick game and
walk with the dice. In doing so, we
can only help the several candidates
who have yet the sense to veto the
president's game plans. I am not so
deluded, however, as to suppose that
if we ignore these people the prob-
lems will disappear.

A plea. For the time being, let us
seek outlets other than violence for
these frustrations. The obvious, if
not ideal, alternatives are: (1) drugs,
(2) the World Series, and (3) your
own Candy Bergen. Pick your poi-
son and say “thank you Richard
Nixon,” we'll see you on the fourth.

Freshman Football Cancelled

BY PALMER TRICE

Freshman football made a differ-
ent appearance at W&L this year.
Those who chose not to participate
on the intercollegiate level were di-
vided into nine teams. For the last
two weeks, we have been able to
participate in action-packed contests
in which we were pitted man against
man, dorm section against dorm
section. The thrill of agony, and
the victory of defeat were ours for
the taking. We of the Old dorm’s
Oilers can hold our heads high and
claim that we were, perhaps the best.
Our record was 3-0,

The Oilers were—and remain—
a motley crew. We had everything—
from speed to lack of speed and size
to pint-size. Just like the pros, we
even had injuries. One of our stars
(of course, we were all stars), suf-
fered a sprained knee in our first
outing, but returned a week later for
our third game. Cases of devotion
to the game, such as this, were seea
frequently, on all teams.

The teams were usually fairly

even, making the games fun for all,
win or lose. All teams had their pro-
blems. Some could not find a leader.
Others were unable to round up
eight players. The Oilers had the
leader, but frequently lacked the
players. In our first two games, we
were forced to play five on five.
Everyone enjoyed the competition
and the exercise. But while we were
mustering five, some dorm sections
were unable to draft any stars. This
resulted in many forfeits, and the
defeat of the purpose of the pro-
gram—which was to give those non-
varsity competitors a chance to play.
Each team was made up of three
dorm sections, They were coached
by one of the dorm counselors, in
our case by Mr. Rob Turnbull. Rob,
or “Coach” to us, was a constant in-
spiration to all of us. His limitless
knowledge of the game, his devotion
to the team, and his soul-moving
halftime pep talks made a bunch of
potential great stars into, not a great
team, but a bunch of great stars.

season to an abrupt finale last week,
we had finally began to collect the
required number for a legal team.
Interest appeared to be growing,
instead of waning. There were of
course many problems with the pro-
gram.

Many students who would like to
play have classes at game time. Labs
tend to put one on the disabled list
for the afternoon. Also, some felt
that they lacked the time this early
in the year. They had to get used to
the system. Some of us who lack the
talent for intercollegiate competi-
tion, but love to play, will play any-
time. There should be a program for
us, and for those who would like to
play with us,

Surely the athletic department
could find us a time and a place to
play. Make the program voluntary,
and place it in a convenient time
slot. A meeting of those that wished
to play could decide such a time.
The purpose of the freshman intra-
mural program was good. Don’t let
it die.

W&L Lacrosse
Ranked 17th

WA&L's lacrosse team ranks 17th
in the country in pre-season rankings
announced today.

Coach Dick Szlasa’s Generals post-
ed an 8-3 record last year, their best
in the school’s history, and just miss-
ed taking the South Atlantic division
championship, losing an 8-7 heart-
breaker to champion North Caro-
lina.

Most of that young team returns
for Coach Szlasa this spring, and
will be joined by a bevy of talented
youngsters among the freshman
class.

The rankings were announced by
“The Lacrosse Newsletter,” the
“bible” of intercollegiate lacrosse.
Last year's national tri-champions,
Virginia, Navy and Johns Hopkins,
are ranked No. 1. Others in the top
ten, in order, are Army, Cornell,
Maryland, North Carolina, Brown
and Yale.

Washington and Lee was ranked
43rd in the national rankings last
year. There are a total of 160 col-
leges now playing lacrosse.

it a favorite among multitudes across
the nation, particularly in Cincinnati.

As most people realize, the Big
Red Machine is not a new model on
display at Woody's or Newcomer’s,
but the Cincinnati Red National
Baseball Club, Inc. Despite the fact
that the Reds have developed engine
problems lately, their American Lea-
gue counterparts for the 1970 World
Series, the Baltimore Orioles, should
by no means be preparing any vic-
tory speeches yet. And although the
Reds did not look like the same ter-
rors of the past season in the first
two games of the October Classic,
they are just too good a team to go
down four straight.

On the basis of the past weekend's
action, the opening Red losses can
be attributed to bad luck in Game
One, and bad pitching in Game Two.
It has been alleged that when Plate
Umpire Ken Burkhart was a Na-
tional League pitcher back in the
40's, the bullpen catchers caught
him ‘bare-handed. Saturday Burk-
hart proved he is as bad an umpire
as he was a pitcher when he com-
mitted what will undoubtedly go
down as one of the biggest no-no’s
in the history of the national pas-
time. Burkhart made two mistakes;
he blocked Baltimore’s Ellie Hend-
ricks from applying what looked to
be a close play at the plate, and
then called the Red’s baserunner
Bernie Carbo out as he slid past
Hendrick’s outstretched arms. Car-
bo represented the tying run in the
4-3 duel won by Baltimore, and the
ruling prevented an extra-inning con-
test and possibly a different outcome.

But bad breaks are part of the
game, and the Orioles might just as
easily have been the victims. How
ever, Burkhart’s blunder suggests
that perhaps the umpires should
think twice before striking soon for
more pay.

The lack of good relief hurling
killed the Reds in the next game as
Baltimore surged from behind to
win 6-5.

Rugby team scrums Hampden-Sydney in 18-14 win last Sunday.

Ruggers Stomp H-S, 18-14

Washington and Lee rugby team
evened its record this week as they
banged out an 18-14 win over stub-
born Hampden-Sydney.

The Generals jumped out to an
early lead when Bob Deaderick fell
on a loose ball in the Hampden-
Sydney end zone and Fred Fletcher
converted the kick to give the rug-
gers a 5-0 lead. Chip Henry later
rolled his way into the end zone with
one minute left in the first half and
raised the score to 13-0.

Early in the second half W&L was
left two men short because of in-
juries and Hampden-Sydney roared
to within two points. However, with

 

cinnati can break a close game wide
open, and their overall pitching
strength ought to rule out the pos-
sibilities of a four-game sweep by
the American Leaguers, On the other
hand, the Orioles have quickly
stacked themselves to a two-game
lead, and have become the hosts for
games three and four.

By the time this article is in your
hands, Spiro Agnew may be doing
handstands in front of Memorial Sta-
dium after the Orioles win Game
Four, but I prefer a longer Series
and predict Baltimore in six or
seven.

H-S; Too Big, Too Fast

By Pete Jones

The Washington and Lee Generals
put together their best mixture of of-
fense and defense thus far this year
but failed to come up with turnovers
as they lost the Homecoming contest
19-0 to Hampden-Sydney.

Turning out for the game was a
crowd of over 3,000, including an
abundance of W&L alumni. The
Generals came to conquer; they
took to the offensive right away, but
the big play eluded their grasp.

Immediately upon receiving the
opening kickoff, the Generals, led by
Steve Fluharty, churned out steady
progress from their own 37 yard-
line, with the help of a pass comple-
tion to Frank Stearns and a penalty.
But on third down and long yardage,
a blitz by Tiger linebacks caught
Fluharty behind the line of scrim-
mage. Fluharty fumbled on the W&L
45 yardline, a play from which
Blue morale never recovered.

Hampden-Sydney later forced
W&L to punt from their own four
and swept down the sidelines to re-
turn the ball to the W&L ten. Three
brilliant defensive stands went to
waste when, on fourth and goal from
the five, the Hampden-Sydney split
end caught a touchdown pass for the
first score of the game. After the
conversion, the score stood 7-0 with
6:23 left in the first quarter.

The remainder of the quarter ran
out to the tune of three plays and a
punt by both sides. As the second
quarter opened however, Hampden-
Sydney put together its longest ball-
control drive of the game, 68 yards,
helped along the way by a personal
foul call against W&L.

After three attempts to score from
two yards out were thwarted by a
brilliant General goalline stand, the
H-S running back broke the line on
fourth down and darted 1% inches

to score with 5:15 left in the half.
The extra-point kick went wide and
the half closed with a 13-0 score.

The defense dominated the third
quarter as twice the Generals stopped
dangerous threats. Hampden-Sydney
penetrated to the W&L 14 yardline
midway in the quarter and had to
cough the ball up on downs.

Even though Hampden-Sydney re-
covered the ball on the very next
play on a fumble, an interception by
Jim Allen ended the challenge. With
only a minute remaining in the third
quarter, Hampden-Sydney began to
roll after receiving a Blue punt on
the W&L 47 yardline. An eight

Virginia Tops
Generals 7-0

BY DAVE TORRANCE

The Washington and Lee soccer
team suffered a bad loss on Sunday
when the University of Virginia
blanked the Generals 7-0. Led by
Jay Connor, who made three goals,
during the game, U.Va. commanded
the game at the half 5-0. Although
the Generals kept the Cavaliers
scoreless in the third quarter, U.Va.
got two more goals in the last period.

Virginia is certainly a different
team this year from the club that
barely squeaked by W&L last year
2-1. This year U.Va. could be the
best team in the state. They out-
passed and out-guessed the Generals
with a form that has been rarely
seen in teams W&L has faced so far
this season.

Perhaps W&L’s problem is its in-
experience; 75 percent of its players
are sophomores and freshmen. The
team’s inexperience is reflected in
its problems with depth and passing.
U.Va. had two squads of players
which they rotated every 10 min
utes last Sunday, while the Generals
had to employ basically one team
throughout the game. The Generals
passing was poor at certain points
in the contest; no doubt this can be
attributed to the team’s inexperience
in playing together.

The Generals have a tough sche-
dule ahead. A consistently hard-
nosed Roanoke College squad will
tangle with the Minks this Saturday,
and in weeks to come the Blue will
play Jacksonville, the fifth-ranked
soccer team in the nation. Undoubt-
edly, the Generals will not be short
on challenges during the rest of the
season. And at the season's close,
they shouldn't be short on experi-
ence, either.

Gossmann added that the IFC
would like a list of pledges that the

they had pledged, so that the com-

motion passed 26 to 8.

Right now hundreds of Americans are

A few prisoners have made it back. They
talk about bamboo cages. Vicious beatings.
Malnutrition. Humiliation.

But the North Vietnamese will tell us
nothing. And it’s this silence that makes our
appeal more urgent.

For the families at home, there is no
word on who’s alive. Who’s dead. Or even
who's being held. There is nothing. Except
the anguish of not knowing.

Maybe you can ome this. By writing
to the one man who can change it: The Presi-
dent of North Vietnam.

Ask him to release the names of prison-
ers, allow them to write to their families,
and let the Red Cross inspect the prisons to
