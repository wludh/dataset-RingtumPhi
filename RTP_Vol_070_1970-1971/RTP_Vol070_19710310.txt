U 8
IN JOINT

On Officers

BY GLENN AZUMA

There are few things which are
less flattering than to be told that
you are a person's second choice. It
‘was in this manner that the follow-
ing column space became available
to me. I was told that it was origin-
ally intended for the new Student
Body President, but with that race
still undecided I was the next best
thing.

This newspaper issue which comes
at the heels of a primary and on the
evening before a final election should
be, I suppose, concerned with the na-
ture of student government. Such
stuff is hardly interesting, especially
since it has been repeated time and
again during the campaign. Perhaps,
what I can do is give my thoughts on
the type of people who run for office
in student government. I speak strict-
ly of my own motivations and hap-
pily my past election makes me feel
more seoure in their airing.

In general, | suppose we are am-
bitious men. Men who like to be
seen and heard and occasionally lis-
tened to. If nothing else student gov-
ernment is an excellent opportunity
for display. In this respect a strain of
egotism is present.

Yet, I believe it is not the domin-
ant force in the drive of people of
my type. The dominant force may
be simply the need to be active. The
peculiar role of student government
as an organ of representative appeal
rather than the holder of any indep-
endent power makes the attainment
of a goal all the more diffiowlt and
challenging. There is always the
hope that your work may result in
something lasting and good.

In a school of this size this is par-
tioularly potent as a motivating force
because One person or a group of
people can significantly alter the im-
mediate course of university life and
the more distant course of the uni-
versity as an educational and experi-
ential entity.

The problem of this activity is ob-
vious, for it is easy to define oneself
in terms of committee positions or
chairmanships or office. This is a
dangerous for such designations are
flimsy justification for an individual,
and titles are as worthless as the
paper upon which they are written.

Finally, student government may
require a significant strain of mas-
ochism. | think that my “colleagues”
will give me unanimous support in
this assertion. There are few events
more danynably boring than a fac-
ulty or student committee meeting
which can last for several hours on
ivsues Of such overriding importance
as to whether classes should begin
on Tuesday rather than Monday or
vice versa.

One's enthusiasm has a tendency
to diminish while tending the ballot
box in the cold of March at 8:00 in
the Freshman Quad. And you can
only conclude that accurate voting
records are a barbaric fetish of De-
moocracy when you have counted 800
ballots four times for a consistent
tally.

If it were only for incidents such
ws these student government could
not be termed a joke, Yet, I believe
that student activities at Washington
and Lee have substantially influenc-
ed the change which has ocourred in
the past several years. I believe we
have seen the increase in the qual-
ity of education and living here at
WAL, Saturday classes are a thing
of the past and Independent Exam
Sohedules are a reality. Attendance
records for underclassmen are gone
while parietal hours are existent with
the prospects of open dormitories

The curriculum has been liberaliz
ed to a point which allows the great

latitude on the part of a stu

dent in choosing his courses. Wi

EC Seeks General Election Petitions;

Pledges On Examinations Discussed

The Executive Committee Mon-
day evening announced that petitions
for the second General election—
presidents and vice-presidents of
each class; Science, Liberal Arts, and
presidents; and
rising sophomore, junior, and senior
E.C. representatives—will be due by
Monday March 15 at 6 p.m.

In other business, the E.C. re-
jected a proposal submitted by Dr.
Robert McAhren for the faculty
E.C., strictly defining the pledge on
the independent exam envelopes.
The E.C. opted instead for a word-
ing change in the present pledge
which would preserve some of the

discretionary powers of the E.C. in

any judicial case that might arise
from a violation of such a pledge.

The Faculty version would have
prohibited any comment to be made
by a student about a final examina-
tion, including a “value judgment,”
an expression or remark concerning
the relative difficulty of the test. The
E.C, complained that, under such a
pledge, any conveyance as to charac-
ter of a test between one student or
another would necessarily always re-
sult in the invocation of the absolute
penalty, whether cheating was in-
volved or not.

“Under such strict codification,
the E.C. would have no function,”
said Jim Slay, senior Law representa-
tive. The E.C. emphasized that the
question of whether a student's com-
munication imparted aid to another
or not was basic to any honor pro-
ceeding that might occur.

Under the version sent to the Fac-
uity E.C. by the student Execoutive
Committee, the words “that impart
information” have been inserted to
the second provision of the pledge.
It would then read: “I will make no
comment about this examination
which imparts information except to
the course instructor until the end of
the entire examination period for all
students,”

Fran Lawrence stated the E.C

position: “It is not a specific concern

whether or not they impart informa-

kind of a value judgment, they had
better be extremely careful not to

The E.C. also agreed that some

Troubs

The Troubadour Theatre will pre-
sent its third major production of
the current season next week from
Tuesday through Friday. The Troubs
will show five one-act plays with dif-
ferent programs on alternate even-
ings. This is something of a first in

E.C. functions in the spring. Law-
rence resolved to formulate some
procedure for transition that could
be implemented for a gradual usur-
pation of powers by the outgoing
members,

It was decided that the following
locations would be used for balloting
tomorrow's Big Five run-offs: fresh-
man quad, inside Washington Hall,
inside the Co-op, and inside Tucker
Hall.

Number 22

Glenn Azuma Wins;
Robinson and Weir
Compete Tomorrow

With a turnout of nearly 54%,
Steve Robinson and Don Weir were
thrown into a run-off Monday for
election to Student Body President.
Also in the run-off balloting, to be
held Thursday, will be the contest
between Rick Gray and Bruce Madi-
son for Student Body Secretary.

Glenn Azuma registered a decisive
victory over John Cassell for Vice-
President; Richard Middleton and
Brian Greig successfully fought off
opposition for the offices of Dance
Board V.P. and Fancy Dress Presi-
dent, respectively.

In the Presidential match, after
two recounts, it was found that Rob-
inson missed a majority by a shim
margin of three votes. The final tal-
lies were: Robinson-397, Weir-240,
and Tom Mays-159, Weir, who en-
tered the race after the petition dead-
line and ran as a write-in candidate,
will have his name on the ballot for
the Thursday run-off.

Amma swept to the Vice-Presi-
dential post with 556 votes to 234
for his opponent, John Cassell. The
vote totals in the three-way race for
Student Body Secretary were: Gray-
353, Madison-320, and Jim Davis-
107.

In the Dance Board contest Mid-
dleton bested sophomore Gary Polia-
koff, 402 to 321 votes. Greig topped
Paul Suthern for the Fancy Dress
leadership, 400 to 263.

Commenting on his plans for the
future of Fancy Dress, Greig said,

“It is basically my philosophy, and
some people seem generally attuned
to bringing it back in some form.”
He expressed hope that it would ap-
pear again, perhaps as a costume
ball.

In addition to the run-off elections
for the Big Five offices the IFC will
hold its elections Thursday, Candi-
dates for president are Bob LaRrue
and Bill Andrews. Running for vice-
president are Griff Steel and Ken
Evans.

Groups Seek
Student Help

Washington and Lee students will
have the opportunity to join local re-
sidents in “Doing Something For
Lexington” during the next month.

The Lexington-Rockbridge Jay-
cees are sponsoring the “Do Some-
thing” project and will circulate
pledge cards in behalf of different
organizations throughout the area.
The pledge cards will then be paired
with the needs of various agencies
im order to see that aid is funneled to
the proper channels.

The project will last for much of
the month and pledge cards will be
available at many outlets and stores
in Lexington.

Hopefully we can spread this thing

Bert Meem, who will be the head
of the Dance Board next year, also

sounded optimistic whout the return

for a rejpivenation of the costume

ments over who in fact owns the
Lomov meadows and whose dog has

“The Boor,” which received wide
acclaim at the Moscow Art Theatre
lets the audience intrude on a self-

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

March 10, 1971

Independent Exams: The Non-Problem

Remember the independent exams schedule which W&L
students began last fall? This spring may be the last time stu-
dents will have the chance to schedule their own exams, ac-
cording to one faculty member.

We're not being alarmists, It just so happens that in a poll
taken by the Executive Committee after the fall term exams,
71% of the 200 or so polled said that they had heard something
about their examination prior to their taking it. A much small-
er percentage said that they had heard references made by
other students to specific questions on an exam, The EC was
not happy. Neither was the faculty Executive Committee.

In fact, the faculty EC asked that the student body EC
take a hard look at the wording of the pledges appearing on
the envelopes used for the examinations. The pledges as they
were printed on the envelopes last fall read:

“I pledge that

“1. L have neither received nor given aid on this examina-
tion,

“2 | will make no comment about this examination and
will discuss it with no one other than the course instructor
until the end of the entire examination period for all students.

“3. I have heard no comment concerning and received no
information about the content of this examination from anyone
other than the course instructor. Any exceptions are listed
below.”

The controversy concerning the results of that EC poll and
the wording of the three pledges on the envelopes rages over
the differentiation between a value comment (i.e., made by
one student to another during the exam period which charac-
terizes the nature of the exam but does not reveal any informa-
tion on the questions the test might cover) and a substantive
comment (i.¢., one which reveals the content of a specific ques-
tion or area of questions).

The value comment would be something like, “That test
was really hard.” Here, no information about the content of
the exam is actually transferred from one student to another,
but the nature of the examination is leaked. Thus, a student
hearing a value comment might be able to direct his study toa
specific area which the course covers, realizing that that ma-
terial would be the hardest and consequently emphasized on
the exam,

The substantive comment (“Better check over the Napoleo-
nic War carefully before your exam”) reveals the actual ma-
terial covered in an exam and is more or less the answer to
the inferences in the value comment.

Dr. Robert McAhren submitted a suggested revision to the
Executive Committee which would make the wording of the
pledge on the envelope more explicit. The EC turned down
that proposed rewrite Monday evening. And rightly so.

The answer to the present independent examination pledges
is not in their inability to convey to the student his responsibil-
ity not to reveal any information about exams. Read the
pledges that appeared on the fall term exam envelopes.

The first pledge is the standard pledge referring to the
circumstances under which the actual exam is taken. The sec-
ond section as well as the third states that the student gives
his word that he has heard and made “no comment” concern-
ing the examination during the period of the independent exam
schedule.

It seems to us that this is explicit enough. No change in the
verbiage of these pledges is going to make the students more
aware of the simple fact that any comment about the exams is
forbidden,

The real problem facing the future of independent exams
for the students is the bickering over the question of value
and substantive comments. Here, it seems to be a moot point
for anyone to argue what constitutes an honor violation in
either of these cases. The fact is that any comment made about
the examination is grounds for a review of the case in ques-
tion by the Executive Committee. or the EC to commit itself
to the faculty that it will consider infractions in either instance
as honor violations is a breach of the rights of the Executive
Committee to reserve judgment on each individual case.

Qn the other hand, the EC has not helped the examination
question by categorizing the results of the poll as a guideline to
the type of violations which occured last term, The pledge on
the front of the envelope is the only issue involved in the deter
mination of possible deviations from the norms which that
pledge requires.

The burden rests with the students to understand their re
quired silence during the independent exam period, It does not
rest with the EC to draft a more explicit pledge than the pre
sent one, It does not rest with the faculty to threaten the EC
by inference with the possible death of the schedule because of
infractions which occured last term, or ones which might occur
in the future.

If the students want to schedule their own exams and take
those exams in freedom, then they must be willing to respond
to the pledge on the front of the envelope, and be ready to re
port any violation of that pledge for the EC's further action

Poverty in and around Rockbridge County poses a serious problem, ac-
cording to the Rockbridge County Welfare Department.

Poverty, Welfare Form
Twin Local Problems

BY KURT KRUMPERMAN

Poverty is one of the greatest
problems that this county faces, and
it is just as pressing in Rockbridge
County as anywhere else. The situa-
tion of poverty can be seen some-
what by looking at the statistics.
Tms article is based on. statistics
from the Rockbridge County Wel-
fare Department, the Rockbridge
County Area League of Women Vot-
ers, and the Rockbridge County
Area Housing Corporation.

The chart to the left indicates the
extent of welfare in the county.

The total budget of the Welfare
Department in the area is $756,560
which is to serve 1011 people. With-
out subtracting the costs of running
the welfare Department (salaries,
supplies, etc.), the budget allows
$748.43 per person per year. This
figure is given only to indicate the
quantities involved but has no par-
ticular relevance to the actual wel-
fare recipient for each case is con-
sidered on individual need.

The maximum allowance for a
family of four in Virginia is:
Standard basic allowance $166.00
Heat and Utilities 18.50
Rent (rent and utilities can go

to maximum of $95) 65 to 75
Laundry $10
Total $259. 50-—269.50

This total figure is equivalent to
$3,130—$3,240/year, which is $603-
613 less than the poverty level of
$3,743 as defined by the Social Sz-
curity Administration in 1969 not to
mention the $5,500 established by
the Labor Department in 1969. Add

Wreden Corrected

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:
I am writing this in correction to
Mr. Nick Wreden’s twice-run letter

held this coming Saturday, which he

Military Institute, and several area
girls’ schools held such a “cun-in”
last Spring at Goshen.

However, we most heartily sup-
port this venture and hope that a
large group of students take part in
this highly-~worthwhile undertaking.
It is only through grass-roots efforts
such as this that a considerable part
of the disgusting garbage fouling our
landscape can be eradicated.

Mare James Small

Executive Director,
WAL University Republican
Club

Tebo Vs. Ennis

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:
1 was glad to see another article
by one of our coeds in a recent is-
sue of the paper. | sat down to read
it with sincere interest, soon to find
myself greatly anmwesed. | discussed
the ideas presented by Miss Ennis
with a friend at hand, then thought
for a while on her ideas. | soon
realized that she was serious.

Let it be known, in thai case, I
am serious in this letter, | am not
mocking her ideas—I wim to criticize
them.

First | see her thinking as ambigu-
ous—or maybe self contradictory.
Miss Ennis emphasizes her desires to
be accepted as a student, as an
equal on this campus. Yet she was
“ignored, so she ignored back.” As a
mele here, | do not expect to be
“loved” minute by minute, and I feel
sure that every male here has his
lonely moments too, That is just life
We are acknowledged some of the
time—and not all of the time.

| feel that the profesor who al-
ways inquired if Miss Banis under.
stood the material at hand was not
irying to spite her—but was merely

acknowledging a lady's presence and
trying to be especially helpful.

As far as Miss Ennis’ idea of “an
endless round of dates, never having
to open a door, and being the center
of attention,” I think she’s in a
dream world. I do believe that W&L
males have the common courtesy to
hold a door for a lady, but if Miss
Ennis expects to be “one of the
bunch,” I doubt that many are going
to carry her books, and follow in her
train. That's strictly junior high-
schoolish.

Personally, I did not appreciate
Miss Ennis’ opinion that “jeans and
tennis shoes certainly lend more to
the student image here.” I feel that
the student body as a whole ought to
resent that. And | base my opinion
on a recent incident on camipus: |
was, one afternoon, stopped by a
visitor from California. He and this
wife were very impressed with W&L
and we talked for a long while. He
made the comment that his daughter
now at UCLA, then he com-

that the W&L students were,
on the whole, very neat and excep-

lly well dressed. | was sin-
cerely proud.

I can well see why a female would
be a novelty on campus, since WAL
is now the oldest all men’s school in
the nation. But I feel that Miss En-
nis’ statement “but W&L really was
not psychologically prepared for
women students—even just seven of
them,” is of greatest folly. I see it as
a matter of precedent, One cannot
expect 1527 men to adjust their es-
tablished way of life and daily rou-
tine to seven, yes, even seven wo-
men, I feel that it is folly to expect
an entire University to react to a
stimulus as weak as seven girls on
campus. At this time it is the girls’
job to adjust. The red carpet is roll-
ed out for the President, but rarely
= the janitor in the Senate cham-

;

And I feel that most males in the
world today know that females exist
seven days a week. The point need
not be over-emphasized.

If Miss Ennis feels that her stay
has really been a traumatic experi-
ence, may I ask one question: Why
doesn't she pack up and leave? I do
not say this spitefully, If life is that
harsh at WAL, the grass is always
greener on the other side. No one
requires her to remain, No one even
requests that she stay, But she's wel-
come to stay if it is her desire.

In conclusion, | would like to
stress a few points, First, I am not
against the seven ladies on campus
at all, In fact, I have greatly enjoyed
getting to know one of the coeds this
year, We abways exchange greeting
and I enjoy chatting with her oc-
casionally. | think it's great to have
thsi exchange program, and | sin-
cerely hope it continues.

I can only say that I'm sorry that
Miss Ennis finds life so hard here.
nothing is worse than listening to
someone bitch about something
which is not required, something
that is not imposed upon her, some-
thing that that person chose on her
own free will, Unfortunately, 1 can-
not have pity on Miss Ennis, with
all due respects. Pveryone’s got to
make his or her own way in this

world, and W&L coeds are no special
exceptions.
Watson Tebo

Kudos To Wreden

‘May a grandmother who believes
the current “younger generation” is
more aware and more concerned
about our country’s problems than
her generation was, commend an
activity that supports her opinion?

I am speaking of Nick Wreden
and his “Goshen Pass Project.” Hav-
ing spent many happy hours in
Goshen Pass before the days of
metal beer cans, my reaction is:
“Hip, Hip, Hooray! and “hats-off”
to the boys who turn out to help!

published in last week's newspaper.
Because I fear that the tone of the
letter referred to gives the impres-
sion of a one-track consciousness (in
regard to ROTC), I wish to point
out to the readers that the letter in
question was submitted to the news-
paper on February 7. They took al-
most a full month to print it. That

1966, 50% of the families in Rock-
‘bridge County had an income of less
than $4000 per year and also, Vir-
ginia has the smallest welfare budget
in the United States. All this indi-
cates that people on welfare are not
the only people who are poor and
these poor are not being helped.

In 1968 the Welfare Department
of Lexington handled 78 ADC cases
while in 1971 they are handling 122.
This can be attributed to many con-
ditions. Due to increased mechaniza-
tion, folding fraternities, and general
economic conditions, jobs are scarce
and incomes are low, Women find it
increasingly difficult to find jobs in
the area. Also the increase in the
welfare rolls can be attributed to
mass communication and a change
of thinking, making people more
willing to turn to public assistance.
This admittedly was attributed in
part to the Rockbridge Welfare
Rights Organization.

‘It is felt by most Welfare De-
partment workers that aid to the
‘blind, disabled, and aged persons,
as well as foster children is a rela-
tively successful program because it
meets many of the needs of these
people and is not psychologically
detrimental. But the Aid to Depend-
ent Children (ADC) program is
viewed as a failure for many rea-
sons: (1) it is not adequately meet-
ing the needs of the families either
materially or psychologically, (2)
there are not enough funds to fi-
nance ADC adequately, and (3) in
Lexington and all over the country
the system itself is facing administra-
tive difficulties,

The welfare departments are al-
lowing mothers to fill out their own
statements of need which is designed
to reduce the check-ups that the
Welfare Department used to make.
With this freedom, it is expected that
people be honest about any new de-
velopments in their situation, If this
is not done (it was not established
either way at the Rockbridge Wel-
fare Department) the system itself
became bogged down and inefficient.

Housing presents another massive
problem. It is felt that conditions
have not changed to any great ex-
tent since the 1960 census, which
revealed that one-fourth of the
homes in Buena Vista, one-third in
Lexington, and one-third in the
county were delapitated.

17.1% of the houses were over-
crowded, according to the census
standards. 14% of the houses in
Rockbridge County were built since
1950 compared to a national rate of
27.5%. This poor housing condi-
tion compounds the housing shortage:
that effects all people in the area but
primarily low income families.

The WAL student body creates
much of the housing problem in the
community, Coupled with the great
shortage of houses is the fact that
landlords know that students can pay
larger rents than the community peo-
ple. Students occupy 114 apartments
(at a rent between $25-125) and 105
houses (rented at $30-185). The stu-
dents form a prosperous market
since they have no other place to
live. This situation will not be alle-
viated until W&L offers the reason-
able alternative of on-campus upper
class dormitories.

Few new homes are being con-
structed (9 in Buena Vista, 6 in Lex-
ington, and 62 in the county in
1969.) Buena Vista lost 34 houses in
Flood Camille. Lexington will lose
eventullay 59 houses, most of lower
income families, because of VMI's
plans to build an auditorium and
parking lot at Main and Diamond,
Only 7 of the 42 remaining houses
are structually sound,

In this bleak situation there is one
good thing that is happening. The
Rockbridge County Housing Cor-
poration is planning to build low in-

BY MARC SMALL

Although we are the most active,
dynamic, powerful, nation in the
world, even though we have an in-
dustrial and financial base that has
ibecome the center of the interna-
tional economic system, in spite of
our mechanized & prominent mili-
tary strength, we have become a
nation of diplomatic cowards. We
are no longer willing to assume the
leadership role that our position en-
tails; in some respects, we are no
longer worthy of our greatness.

Our traditional foreign policy was
based on the twin precepts of non-
intervention an dfriendship towards
all states willing to reciprocate: this
policy was abandoned four decades
ago for the far more dangerous and
suicidal concept of enemnity toward
our friends and friendship towards
our enemies.

We make overtures ioward Red
China—a state dedicated to the
overthrow of the United States
while diplomatically ignoring Rho-
desia, whose offer of friendship and
co-operation should have been read-
ily accepted by this country. We
make open attacks on Spain and
Greece, whose governments have re-
stored law and peace to badly-fract-
ured lands.

Remember the “Better-Red-than-
Dead” doctrine? Shouldn't that un-
willingness to fight for ideology be
applied to rightist as well as leftist
nations? We stave off collapse from
infiltrated and corrupt civil govern-
ments, while we open trade relations
with Central and Eastern European
nations whose leaders have firmly
stood behind the Soviet Union in its
drive to topple the popularly-elect-
ed regimes of the Western Bloc.

Through A Spyglass Darkly ...

A New Foreign Policy

 

Why are we so blind? Why do we
fail so utterly to see the prediction
towards which we are approaching?
The answer is found in the increas-
ing tendency of our government to
base its decisions on “morality”: a
nebulous and indefinable abstract
that has only clouded the waters
while failing to provide a firm and
cohesive policy. This too-extensive
use of “morality” in foreign affairs
with little tempering of pragmatism
is unsuitable for many reasons: it
can be interpreted too many ways, it
is not conducive towards rational
thinking, and it is far too emotional
and sentimental for the necessary
pragmatism of state decisions.

“Morality” in diplomacy has its
place most definitely, as nations
should attempt to be honest, fair,
and open-minded towards each other,
but for a nation’s whole foreign pol-
icy to be founded on a moral base is
idealistically unrealistic.

The dangers of such moral diplo-
macy have been seen in our own
time: the Japanese-American con-
flict in the Pacific was the result of a
series of moral positions made by
both states, and when we felt mor-
ally obligated by our Western ethics
to embargo Japan in 1941, they felt
themselves equally honour-bound by
their Code Bushido to attack in de-
fense of the Emperor's honour. This
sort of unfortunate “incident” is
bound to result from the conflict of
two opposing moral codes,

We must return to the sanity of
friendship towards all friendly states
before some “moral” misjudgment
finds us either nuclear ash on a burn-
ing planet, or else, as the logical
conclusion of our current policy,
weak-kneed do-gooders trapped in
the miasma of our own idealism.

Miss Devlin’s Talk
Yields Controversy

BY DOUG BURTON

Sounding her audience with soft
crescendos of her leftist hard line,
socialist revolutionary Bernadette
Devlin announced last week that she
was not ‘bringing the barricades of
Northern Ireland to Randolph-Ma-
con. For a few tense moments it
seemed the demure Macon audience
would bring the barricades to her.

Even before she came, some of
the faculty mumbled that $2,000 was
far too much to pay for a “commun-
ist revolutionary,” yet, the most
vociferous resistance to her crusade
for socialism came from among stu-
dents themselves. The question and
answer period after the speech last
Saturday night included a shout ’em
up between Miss Devlin and a young
male visitor over whether Androw
Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller
made their money or stole it. The
crowd, which to be sure was not un-
animous in its reaction to the self-
disavowed firebrand, indicated by its
applause that the two rich men stole
it. There was, however, no thunder-
ous Johnny-Carson-show vote of
confidence.

LETTERS TQ THE EDITOR

lo the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

I have two remarks. First, with
the general depletion of resources
and mounting waste in this country,
it is unexcusable that student candi-
dates for office post dozens upon
dozens of paper sheets, and in a
flimsy manner,

Many of the sheets fall down or
are torn down and make a mess, as
well as not serving their purpose.
The candidates should be limited in
the number of sheets, be disqualified
if a mess ocours, or be allowed to
publicize only in this paper.

Second, the date of a letter writ-
ten to the editor is often important
A letter may appear several weeks
after it is submitted and may be use-
less by then. Why does this happen?
Is the editor restricted by something
like space requirements, or is he
guided by desire?

lt is only fair to the writer that a
date appear with his letter. I feel
that a date should be required with
a letter, similar to a name being re
quired

“Essentially you are a very selfish
set of people. You like very com-
fortably,” she told the Maconites.
“Many of you dream of the bibera-
tion of women without lifting a pal-
try hand for the women workers of
America. What have you done? No-
ibody is going to knock on your door
and tell you it's time for revolution
. . . People don’t know what is hap-
pening in this country. People are
dying; people are hungry; they’re
fighting over the crumbs because you
won't help them. We are the ma-
jority, but we cannot be without
your help, and we have never had
it.”

Miss Devlin’s catalogue of the
evils and terrors of capitalism dealt
not with Ireland but with the United
States. Her major contention was
that poverty in America was caused
by 5% of the people controlling 80%
of the wealth. “There are only two
kinds of people in the world,” she
said, “workers of the world, and the
exploiters. We are the people of the
world; we are not Catholics or Pro-
testants; we are not Black or Whites
or Chicanos; we are the workers of
the earth.”

Showing obvious signs of fatigue,
Bernadette attended a reception af-
terwards, and, in keeping with her
pugnacity on the stage, met with an
additional battery of questions. Her
appearance concluded her speaking
tour in the United States which be-
gan in mid-February.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

 
   

BY JEFFERY B. SPENCE

If a person here on campus wants
to find out what is going on, or if he
just wants to relax with some friends
over a beer, the place to go is the
Cockpit in the Student Union. The
atmosphere is pleasant and the beer
flows freely.

Unfortunately, there is now the
very real possibility that the beer tap
iat the Cockpit could be shut off. The
reason? Students are consuming al-
coholic beverages in areas of the
Union which is not authorized for
such consumption, In fact, the con-
sumption of any alcoholic beverage
other than 3,2 beer is illegal. The
Stipulations contingent upon W&L
having a beer license are very precise
and very strict.

The University may have a license
if only 3.2 beer is served, and that
the beer remain inside of the area
where it is served. This means that
persons buying beer in the Cockpit
may not carry it outside the confines
of that room. One is not even allow-
ed to transport beer from the Cock-
pit to Evans Dining Hall, which is
the other place authorized for sale
and consumption of beer.

When a place obtains a beer li-
cense in Virginia it is put under
some very strong restrictions. If
they don’t like these restrictions they
can surrender the license. Although
the Cockpit is operated under a dif-
ferent authority than the Union, it is
still endangered by those who bring
in beer or wine from the outside and
drink it anywhere in the contiguous
structure of the Union and Evans
Dining Hall. The A.B.C. license that
we have allows only 3.2 beer ob-
tained in the Cockpit or Evans Din-
ing Hall and it does not allow the
beer to be transported outside of
these two areas to any other rooms.

Admittedly, the Alcoholic Bever-
age Control Board of Virginia, in
their effort to protect the public’s
moral code, has created some assin-
ine rules. However, if we want to
maintain our license we are going to
have to abide by the rules, no matter
how ridiculous they may seem.

One of the major reasons why the
Student Union is being closed down
from two till seven in the morning is
that there has been a great deal of
after-hours drinking which has in-
chided wine, spirits, and 6.4 beer, all
of which could get our license
lifted.

If this practice continues any-
where in the building at anytime we
will lose our privilege to serve beer.

The Endangered License

There is no reason why a small
minority of offenders should be al-
lowed to threaten the privilege en-

Tough Schedule Ahead

Stickmen Ready

BY RAY SWANN

The W&L lacrosse team, coached
by Dick Szlasa, is preparing for a
tough campaign against some of the
best teams in the country.

Led by captain midfielder Whit
Morrill, the team boasts many re-
turning lettermen. Chip Thomkons
and Jim MoCane are other standouts
at the midfielder spot. These upper-
classmen are backed up by a talented
trio of freshmen: Ted Bauer, Skip
Lichtfuss and John Lalley. Coach
Slasa feels the three can develop
into a tight-knit unit.

Returning lettermen at the attack
include leading scorer Sam Engle-
hart, a midfielder last year. Co-cap-
tain Scott Neese and Hank Slauson
help round out the attack. Other at-
tackmen include Matt Lamotte, Bill
Rienhoff and Bob Brumback.

The defense is anchored by letter-
men Tommy Smith, Don Eavenson
and John Rogers. Bill Brunrback, a
Ist-team All American, will miss the
first four games to compete in the
National Swimming meet. Bob Rad-
cliffe, John Larmour, Bob Turco,
and Ed McLaughlin are the other
defensemen.

The goal-tending job is being
fought for by last year’s goalie Bill
Ingersoll, freshman Skeeter Chad-
wick and Charles Robson.

The Generals lost relatively few
players from last year’s squad, All-
American Ned Coslett, Jay Meri-
weather, South All-Star Tom Groton
and John Thomas were senior start-
ers last year.

The highlight of practice so far
was last Saturday's scrimmage
against the tough Mount Washing-
ton Lacrosse Olub, made up of for-
mer stickman from such powers as
Johns Hopkins and Maryland. The
scrimmage was a “learning experi-
ence” for the Generals, many of
whom have only been practicing for
a week.

The season opens March 20th at
home against Randolph-Macon, the
newest addition to our lacrosse divi-
sion. Although a relative newcomer
to lacrosse, the R-M team should
prove a tough opponent.

LaRue’s Press Box

Heard here and there while wait-
ing for the Virginia weather to make
up its mind...

Look for an Ali-Frazier rematch
this fall in Los Angeles. Why else
would Jack Kent Cooke put up all
that cash? Fight Number Two will
be in Cooke’s swankienda, the For-
um... The place to have gone for
a wager on this fight was Europe,
where Alli, extremely popular, was a
3 to 1 favorite. That is, if you were a
Frazier man. ...

Any team could win the Atlantic
Coast Conference's basketball cham-
pionship this year, but my money is
on an interstate battle between the
Carolinas... .

And this weekend’s hardcourt ac-
tion also features a return contest
between the West Coast powers,
UCLA and Southern California.
That should turn out to be another
close one... .

Washington and Lee's baseball
team faces one of the roughest sche-
dules ever. Included in the spring
trip to Houston are Rice, the South-
west Conference's runner-up to Tex-
as last year, and San Jacinto Junior
College, which reached the finals of
the JUCO World Series . . . Not to
mention home openers with always
tough Long Island University and
Southern Connectiout. ...

After spending three years on the
tour, J. C. Snead, a nephew of
Slammin’ Sam, finally broke into the
money with victories in the Tucson
Open and the recently completed
Doral-Eastern Open. He earned elss
than his present winnings in a four
year stint as an outfielder in the
Washington Senators’ chain. .. .

1 can’t help but shudder about
what’s going to happen this year
with those perennial baseball bad-

First Charley Finley suited his
Athletics in bright green and gold,
with white shoes. Then Pittsburgh
went mod with those pullover and
pull-on uniforms with elastic. Now
the big thing is a colorful ball glove,
like those worn by some Cincinnati
and New York Met players... .

Frazier’s vietory denied a lot of
people the chance to see Ali stroke
out Howard Cosell, an event almost
as eagerly awaited as the fight itself
... But at least the people who paid
those terrific sums for ringside seats
got their money's worth. The Ali-
Cleveland Williams fight in Houston
some years ago was Over One minute
and 23 seconds into the first
round. ...

Rumor has it perhaps unfounded
—that Redskin Head Coach George
Allen has another giant trade cooked
up... And whatever happened to
John Romnosky?

W&L basketball, with all its hoop-
la, is over for the 1970-71 season.
Hopefully, the Generals have closed
out the career of Doremus with a
win, as the plans call for the team to
move into the new gymnasium next
year. With much luck, next year’s
squad will open the season with Vir-
ginia, at home.

ain’s best players, the team has been
learning American rules for about a
month in preparation for competi-
tion in this country. Unlike many
foreign teams that have visited the
U.S., they come to play a serious,
hard-nosed game. It is hoped that
the team’s tour will help lacrosse
gain the status of an Olympic sport.

Dartmouth, a perennial Ivy Lea-
gue contender, comes to town on
March 24, followed by East Caro-
lina on the 27th.

Also on the schedule this year are
two of the three national co-cham-
pions, Navy and U. Va. The Blue
will again face North Carolina, a
team which barely survived a late
General rally last year. Duke ends
the season when it visits Lexington
in May.

losses sustained from last year’s ex-
cellent team. In spite of the fact that
the club started with no seniors, it
finished second among the state's
small colleges.

The Generals compiled a 7-3 re-
cord against in-state competition.
They were 17-8 overall. For the
fourth time in five years, Washington
and Lee garnered first place in the
OAC basketball tournament. This
year’s team went 10-1 at home, los-
ing only to Loyola of Baltimore by
one point. It's a shame that we have
to leave Doremus,

turns up many glaring weaknesses.
Perhaps the most obvious of these
was the lack of a consitsent scorer to
complement Mike Daniel. Mike was
the only General to average double
figures. We need a shooter, one that
can hit from the outside with consis-
tency.

Another problem was a lack of
height. The squad could use another
big man. However, I understand that
this year's recruiting has been aimed
at solving this problem. Most of
Coach Canfield’s prospects are 6'4”
or better.

In spite of these problems, the
Generals had a more than adequate
year. This can be attributed to an
excellent defense, a very strong
bench, and, primarily, to a great
deal of hustle. It was a frequent oc-
curence to see one of the squad on
the floor after a loose ball. The
matchasp defenes worked well. Al-
most everyone on the team started at
least one ball game. These assets
proved more than enough to achieve
a winning season. Also, it is com-
forting to know that the Generals
will improve with age: next year’s
team will be older, wiser, and better
balanced.

This year's team improved with
every game. After losing a close con-
test with Loyola, the Generals came
back from 13 points down against
UNC. They showed that they never
quit, and, in that game, they showed
a great deal of poise.

Dhis year’s record could have been
a little betier. Perhaps the losses to
Hampden-Sydney and Navy could
have been avoided, but most of the
other losses were due, at least in
part, to a very tough schedule.

Whatever we did wrong, we siill
ended with a 17-8 record. “A new
era has begun.”

called Mountain View Terrace and
hopefully construction will begin in
early spring.

R.C.H.C, is a non-profit onganiza-
tion which will have 40 years to pay
off a $600,000 loan and interest.
Therefore, the rents must be large
enough to pay this loan. The renter
must pay 25% of his income while
the government will pay up to 70%
of the rent. Thus it is estimated that
the minimum income of a family
able to rem here will be $2,100,
therefore eliminating the very poor.
No overcrowding will be allowed,
which enables people to pay for pre-
sent housing but may restrict their
eligibility for Mountain View Ter-
race. There may be further restric-
tions on its residents, but these are
not defined as of yet.

So, although Mountain View Ter-
race may lessen the housing prob-
lem, it is by no means solved with
only 40 units, The housing problem
will remain unsolved; the poor con-
tinue to be in the same situation.

Only the poor have a monopoly
on the experience of poverty.

Fancy Dress Returning?
Dance Board Thinks So

(Continued from Page 1)

Five Elections for the position of
Fancy Dress President. The winner,
Brian Greig, has definite plans for
the dance. Other members of the
Dance Board agree that the weekend
“could come back.” Their only ques-
tion seems to be money. The Dance
Board cannot spend lavish sams on
its tight budget.

Perhaps the ball might return but
with a new format. None of the
Dance Board members contacted
favored the old black tie format.
The old theme concept however
might be incorporated in the new
Fancy Dress Ball scheme.

So, is the Fancy Dress Ball gone
forever? Not quite yet, not quite yet.

W&L Admissions Bucking Trend

While many private colleges and
universities appear to be experienc-
ing a dramatic slump in the number
of students applying for admission
next fall, officials today reported “an
opposite trend, an encouraging ad-
missions picture” in both the under-
graduate and law divisions for W&L.

In the School of Law alone, ap-
plications are up by more than 50
per cent, according to Law Dean
Roy Steinheimer, Jr. Even before de-
ciding on March | to accept no fur-
ther applications, he said, the law
school had 10 formal applications on
file for each place in next Septem-
iber’s entering class.

On the undergraduate level, Ad-
missions Dean James D. Farrar not-
ed a small increase in the number of
applications received, “perhaps one
per cent.” Last year Washington and
Lee received about 1,250 applica-
tions for some 370 places in its fresh-
man class, Farrar said. This year a
slightly higher number of applica-
tions will be proceeded, with the uni-
versity aiming at an undergraduate
freshman enrollment of 350 to 370.

The increase in applications comes
despite an announced increase in
Washington and Lee's comprehen-
sive fee (tuition plus officially fixed
expenses), and despite a simultane-

joyed by the majority of students
here at W&L. Therefore | appeal to
those of you who have violated the
rules to cease and desist before we
have our license lifted as a result of
your activities.

There is one other problem that
we face in relation to the Cockpit:
the increasing influx of local under-
age children coming to the Cockpit.
They are a constant threat to our
A.B.C. license. As a result, the
Union has posted a sign to the ef-
fect that only students, faculty, staff,
and their guests at W&L may use
this establishment.

It is a great idea if it is enforced,
so let's enforce it. The other night
I saw at least 15 children from the
Lexington-Buena Vista area most of
whom I know to be underage.

If we are going to protect our-
selves as a community it is going to
be necessary for us to help Murph
police the Cockpit by turning in to
him those persons who are not sup-
posed to be on the premises. Our
beer license is a great thing to have,
don’t let it be jeopardized, Peace.

According to separate surveys re-

downward trend is evident in num-

private colleges, especially in the
