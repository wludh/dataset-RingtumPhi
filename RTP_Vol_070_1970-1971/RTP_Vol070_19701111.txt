On Marble Valley

BY DOUG BURTON

Mrs. Culbert McGay and Mrs.
John McGregor are even tempered
‘women, long time residents of Vir-
ginia. But they have a_ problem.
Among the public service projects
now before the Federal Power Com-
mission in Washington is a pumped
storage dam proposed for Marble
Valley, which is their home and the
home of 40 Virginia families now
threatened by the dam.

Their consternation began one
morning in June of 1968 when Vir-
ginia papers carried a story that
Virginia Electric Power Company
planned a $95 million project to
flood more than 1,800 acres in the
valley. Since then Mrs. McGay and
Mrs. McGregor have helped organize
the Save Marble Valley Association,
and now, with the aid of the Vir-
ginia Commission on Outdoor Re-
creation, the ladies may do just that.

Of course, the residents of Mar-
ble Valley could never have ac-
complished the protest had not their
concern been shared by numerous
conservation groups who doubt the
feasibility of the damsite as a future
recreational facility. Among those
concerned are the Environmental
Defense Fund, Sierra Club, Isaac
Walton League and Abe Fortas’ law
firm in Washington.

The latter has agreed to represent
the residents before the Federai
Power Commission.

The dam in question will not be
an ordinary hydroelectric facility
but a pumped-storage dam which
actually stores energy, in the form
of water, until it is needed. The ar-
rangemem calls for two dams and
two reservoirs — one high, one
low. By pumping from a lower re-
servoir to an upper reservoir during
off periods — at night and on week-
ends, VEPCO can, in a sense, charge
its battery, When maximum de-
mands for electricity are made dur-
ing the daytime, water in the up-
per reservoir is permitted to pass
through turbines to the lower re-
servoir, providing electricity for the
peak hours,

One of the points VEPCO makes
in arguing for the dam is that the
resulting reservoir would “create
recreational area which should bene-
fit not only the residents of the local
counties, but should attract many

Executive Committeemen give serious consideration to Monday’s meeting

Elections Statement Released By EC

BY RITA ENNIS

In light of the recent semi-contro-
versy concerning Freshman elections,
the Executive Committee released
the following statement in its Mon-
day night session:

“The Executive Committee recog-
nizes that there was a degree of lax-
ness in the supervision of the last
election, However, it is our feeling
that there was no breach of faith to
the student body on the part of any
member of the committee. We real-
ize that an air of impartiality should
surround all election proceedings;
that ballot boxes should be watched
carefully; that there should be no
campaigning around the polls. We
assure the university administration
that steps are being taken to make
sure that these conditions are main-
tained in all future elections.”

Other action taken by the EC fo-
cused primarily on the Honor Sys-
tem—establishing guidelines for
Honor violation investigations and
scheduling the distribution of Honor
System questionnaires.

Jim Slay proposed a set of in-
vestigation guidelines which includ-
ed three basic statements: 1) The
Honor System applies at all times;
in an investigation a student is as-
sumed to be aware of the fact and
will not be reminded; 2) During an
investigation, the accused has the
right to remain silent until the Stu-

dent Control Committee hearing; an
admission or denial of guilt is not to
be demanded; 3) The accused, while
he does not face his accuser, has the
right to know the exact information
before the Committee against him.
The Committee will protect his rights
by examining the accuser thor-
oughly.

The
mously.

Honor System questionnaires will
be distributed today through Friday
in the usual polling places. Phil
Thompson, in the Honor System
Study report, stated that a compila-
tion of results will be presented at
the next EC meeting.

Faculty Rebuffs IFC Plan;
Sets SAC Parietal Policy

BY SKIP PAUKERT

The faculty Monday evening pav-
ed the way for future changes in
parietal regulations, delegating the
full authority for such decisions into
the hands of the Student Affairs
Committee. The _ Interfraternity
Council's petition, calling for total
IFC authority to “establish all reg-
ulations regarding the visitation of
women in the fraternity houses,”
was defeated by the faculty.

The Student Affairs Committee is
jointly chaired by both students and
faculty members, and this body had
approved and recommended to the
faculty the defeated IFC petition.
The IFC proposal, presented at the
faculty meeting by IFC president
Doug Gossmann and Joe Garten,
had attempted to give the IFC Judi-
cial Board the sole right to review
and approve each fraternity’s parie-
tal plans, even though SAC would
have reserved the right to review any
violations of the regulations.

This was rejected in favor of the
following resolution: “That the fac-
ulty of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity delegate to the Student Af-
fairs Committee authority to es-

A theoretical physicist whose ma-
jor interests have focused on appli-
cations of quantum mechanics to
atoms and nuclei, Dr. Merzbacher
earned his A.M. and Ph.D. degrees
at Harvard. The Berlin-born physi-
cist became the Kenan professor of
Physics at North Carolina in 1969,

Dr .Merzbacher has been associat-
ed with the Nuclear Structure Lab-
oratory at Duke University as we!!
as with the Oak Ridge Laboratory

Governor Holton commented that
it was “good for students to think
freely, but they don't have to cut
the establishment off.”

In the informal 55 minute press
conference, Holton responded to
questions on the financing and integ-
ration of state supported institu-
tions, campus disturbances and eco-
logical problems. He declined to
comment upon the lack of help he
received from the Nixon admini-
stration during the campaign of Re-
publican Ray Garland for U.S. Sen-
ate.

Referring to a question on the
change in the code of conduct at the
University of Virginia, Holion re-
marked that although the students
have the right to a share in the rule-
making responsibility, “the rules
need to fit the mores of the society,”
He went on to note that the tax-
paying public has a “legitimate” in
terest in the formulation of the
codes of conduct at all state schools

Scholarship will be given on an
individual Virginia stu
denis demonstrating need by 1972,
weccording to Holion. Thus the state
government can provide “indirect”
help to private institutions in need
of scholarship funds, he said. In
general, Holton evaluated the new
ly approved Virginia Constitution as
1 “benefit” to all institutions of
higher education in the state

"When the

marked that a ramification of stu-
dent unrest was the resultant with-
drawal of promised contributions :o
institutions,

“Im trying now to patch up a
gramt which was withdrawn from
one of our institutions of higher
learning because of disturbances on
that campus last May. It will be per-
manently withdrawn if there is any
more violence.”

In the realm of integration the
Governor appraised his goal as the
realization of “unitary system” in
the state supported colleges and uni-
versities. He did not however think
“fair” HEW criticism of Virginia
schools’ integration practices. “The
HEW asked for a nickel, the college
gave a dime, and HEW came back

for a quarter,” he observed.

When asked about his position on
the proposed dam project on Craig
Creek near Roanoke, Holton felt it
justified at the present time because
of the need for a higher water level
downstream on the James River. He
noted that it was the cheapest and
most efficient of all proposed pro-
jects, but that he had not made the
final decision upon its implementa-
tion.

Concluding with a comment about
the status of the Republican Party
in Virginia, the Governor noted that
the GOP elected six out of 10 con-
gressmen in the recent elections.
“There are some great things that
have happened to the Republican
Party,” he concluded,

tablish policy and approve regula-
tions regarding the visitation of wo-
men in fraternity houses and Uni-
versity dormitories. The authority
of the Student Affairs Committee
will be exercised through review and
approval or rejection of decisions of
the Interfraternity Council Judicial
Board or the Student Control Com-
mittee on proposals submitted by in-
dividual fraternities or dormitory
residential units.”

Dean Lewis John emphasized that
the SAC jurisdiction applies to the
dormitory units, whose plans will go
through the Student Control Com-
mittee, as well as to the fraternities,
whose plans will go through the IFC
Judicial Board.

“The faculty didn’t insist on re-
taining the authority, but rather than
give total authority to the IFC, they
decided it would be better in the
long run for SAC to be responsible
for these matters,” said Dean John.
“Even though the IFC Judicial
Board has been very responsible, it
was felt that it would be advantage-
ous for parietals to be handled by a
cominuous official joint body of fac-
ulty and students, to review both
IFC and Student Control Committee
actions.”

With regard to other action at the
faculty meeting, Dean Pusey re-
affirmed the regulation of the Re-ad-
missions Committee that students in-
tending to graduate in June must be
enrolled in the Spring Term, even if
they already have the required cred-
its.

The Committee on Courses and
Degrees announced the initiation of
two new Art courses, both offering
internships at the Virginia Museum
of Fine Arts in Richmond.

Art 350, entitled Museum Meth-
ods, will entail the administration,
organization, acquisition, preserva-
tion, restoration, cataloging, exhibi-
tion, and other activities concerning
museums and their artifacts. The
course will be limited to junior and
senior art majors who carry a 3.0
GPR, along with 12 credits in an-
cient or modern languages, recom-
mendation of the department chair-
man, and an interview with the pro-
gram director of the museum.

Art 385 will be a museum apprer-
ticeship in preparation for a career
in museumology. The courses, open
by invitation only to one student
per year, will have as a prerequisite
Art 350 and the approval of both
Dr. Doyon of the Art Department
and the museum program director.

The faculty also voted to place a
student representative on the Com
mittee on Courses and Degrees.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
November 11, 1970

The Comedie Lexington And The Future Of Fine Arts

“The Troubs...
have been imprisoned,
artistically, in a degrading
and disgraceful
mausoleum.”
Editorial,
The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
October 3, 1967

Since these words were written in October
of 1967, not much has been done about the
state of the Troubadour’s “theatre.” Each pro-
duction which occurs at the red garage on the
corner of Main and Henry serves to make the
miracles the Troubadours work more com-
monplace, oddly enough. Last week's major
iniracle, for instance, was “Billy Budd”—an
exciting performance of an extremely diffi-
cult script.

Aside from the creativity of the direction
and the acting, we found the set to be the
heart of the miracle. Mr. Ken Barnes had no
mean task before him when he set out to
create a ship’s deck on a stage upon which
any self-respecting Sunday school teacher
would scoff at the idea of producing a Christ-
mas pageant. Mr. Barnes’ product was bril-
liant; yet as an onlooker in the theatre com-
mented Saturday night, the set was “O.K.”

So, we continue to have commonplace mir-
acles in a building which is more suited for
high school productions such as “Giget Goes
Hawaiian” than a college production such
as the one 650 people witnessed last week.

At this juncture, some will argue that the
Troubadour’s “theatre” has been renovated
adequately enough to suit the needs of the
department for the next decade. Perhaps this
is true. The “theatre” has a whole shop now
which was added off the left wing of the build-
ing. With this addition, the shop facilities for
the theatre have been rendered inadequate-—
before that, they were nil, If one cares to
browse around further in this grand tour of
Lexington’s own answer to the Comedie
Francaise, he will find about three feet of
space on stage right. That (in case you are
in doubt) is the stage right wing, featuring
enough space for one actor to turn around in
as long as he’s not wearing a bulky costume.

A walk to the front of the stage will yield
an enlightening discovery: ever since “The
Caucasian Chalk Circle” in 1967, there has
been an apron added to the stage to give the
players and the director more room in which
to work. Neat? Yes, except for reports of sev-
eral strained necks belonging to those who sit
in the first several rows of each production.
Intent on further exploration, the ambitious
will trek up the now non-squeaking (con-
crete) steps to the second floor where he
finds two (new) offices which give one the
impression that he has just entered the con-
fines of a get-rich-quick loan company lend-
ing up to $500 to vagrants. A (new) large
open area serves as the costume room; al-
though here again one needs a signpost of
some sort before this credibility gap can be

lessened.

An uneducated glimpse of the (new)
light booth reveals that the standard of in-
adequacy has not been overlooked here either.
In fact, anyone who has ever screwed in a
light bulb without help will be ready to at-
test to his befuddlement about lighting the
postage stamp stage.

And on the mad dash for the front door,
one should note the dramatic deception be-
tween the appearance of the (new) lobby and
the disappearance of the rest of the (new)
“theatre.”

After this tour of absurd proportions, we
come back to the question which has been out
of hand for about five years: why is Wash-
ington and Lee University allowing this “dis-
graceful mausoleum” to continue? Before
speculating about the answer to this ques-
tion, we cannot overlook the fact that in the
“Report of the Visiting Committee” made in
September of 1967, it was stated that the Uni-
versity is contemplating appropriation of
$3,500,000 for an “adequate auditorium and
‘little theatre.’ ”

Of course we realize full well that money
cannot be appropriated until it is received
through grants and gifts to the University.
Yet we wonder how it was decided that an
impressive gymnasium would be constructed
before a desparately needed library; that a
parking lot be built at Liberty Hall for non-
existant freshman cars—what we see are
patches of gravel where grass once grew ; and
finally that in planning for the University’s
future, the realm of dramatic art is associat-
ed with the need for an “auditorium” and is
characterized as “little.”

We are inclined to believe that the ap-
parant lassitude of the University towards
the construction of a more-than-adequate
theatre is created by several general attitudes.

(1) The Troubadours are thought of by
many to be more of a “clubby get-together”
drama group and less of a serious, dedicated
organization led by professionals.

(2) The Troubadours manage to do
“O.K.” in their present surroundings.

(3) Dramatic art is still conceived of as a
spin-off of the University more than it is re-
garded as a valuable asset.

(4) Educationally speaking, the University
does not appear to be in the fine arts market.

Frankly we see these qualified generaliza-
tions as a result of attitudes which were held
in the era before the advent of Professor Lee
Kahn's arrival in the mid 1960's. There can
be little dispute that Mr. Kahn’s brilliant di-
rection has done much for theatre at Wash-
ington and Lee. Yet one man can only do so
much, even with the valuable assistance of
Mr. and Mrs. Ken Barnes.

We strongly urge that the University and
the student Planning and Development Com-
mittee undertake a study of the following two
proposals,

@ The construction of an arena theatre
which can be converted with ease to the more
conventional proscenium arch, This could and
should be effected by no later than 1975, paral-
leling the construction of the library, A fune-
tional auditorium could be erected apart from
this theatre which would serve the needs of
not only university assemblies, but speaker
symposiums such as “Contact” and university
dances,

@ The creation of a School of Fine Arts
of a caliber which would place Washington
and Lee in the forefront of all colleges and
universities in Virginia for the undergradu-
ate training of individuals in the fine arts,
perhaps man’s highest form of communica-
tion,

Keeping in mind that a university may
lose its own educational purpose by striving
to accomplish many goals at once, we cannot
ignore the void which the present “theatre”
creates for the future of dramatic art and ul-
timately the fine arts at the University, To
our present knowledge, no college or univer-
sity in Virginia is widely known for its ex-
ceptional excellence in the fine arts. By 1980,
there could be one.

A Corollary Imperative For 1,400 Alumni

While we're on the subject of the Univer-
sity’s future, it seems to us that one area in
which the students have been woefully lax is
planning and development, The student Plan-
ning and Development Committee is estab-
lished as a yearly committee to aid the Uni-
versity in directing its future. Yet that or-
ganization has done little.

We believe that the committee could be
made much more effective if it were separated
into two standing committees: the Planning
Committee and the Development Committee,
The Planning Committee would work with
the University on studies of needs and time-
tables for construction; whereas the Develop-
ment Committee's sphere of concern would

he meeting the financial needs of the Univer-
sity so that it might realize its future,

More specifically, literature disseminated
from each of these committees to the student
body would aid in the education of the stu-
dents to the needs of the University. It seems
to us that many students leave the campus of
Washintgon and Lee thinking that the institu-
tion is “well off” financially, Perhaps this at-
titude is valid—as long as the University has
no plans to develop its land resources,

If Washington and Lee is to grow and if
the students, who will be the alumni of five
years from now, are to have a part in this
growth, the formation of these two commit-
tees ts imperative,

Letters To The Editor...

Jones Replies To Prater

About Freshman Elections

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

This letter is in reference to Mr.
Prater’s of last week, and the ac-
companying editorial in which I
and members of my fraternity were
accused of trying to influence the
freshman elections of October 22 by
politicing [sic] at the polls. Mr. Pra-
ter failed to disclose his source, but
I feel that all his righteous indigna-
tion could have been eased with a
little investigation on his part. I
personally do not remember saying
anything to a freshman such as the
quote that Prater gave. Nor do two
freshman, not pledges in my house,
who were talking with me the en-
tire hour and a half I was at the box.

The only possible explanation |
can give to Prater’s accusation is
that | might have made a similar re-
mark jin jest. However, I'm sure it
could have easily been recognized
as such, If it was said, it was an en-
tirely innocent joke which I cannot
even remember saying.

1 apologize for handling the poll-
ing box in what | now realize was a
too relaxed and casual manner. |
never thought of the implications of
jovial remarks which could be con-
strued to slander. The E.C. passed a
resolution Monday night which ac-
knowledged a somewhat loose at-
titude on our part in conducting the
polls, and it will not happen in the
future.

As to the editorial in The Ring-
tum Phi, | can only note the irony
in that it would mention “an eighth
grade homeroom election” in what
was obviously an eighth grade piece
of yellow journalism, Any journa-
list of merit knows the damage that
can be inflicted on a person’s reputa-
tion by quoting out of context and
with no investigation. Perhaps the
paper was trying to generate excite-
ment at the expense of others.

The most regrettable thing to
come from this furor is that it has
unjustly tainted the victory of the
three freshmen elected. They won
individually and on their own merit
without any assistance from me or
anyone else at the polls. It seems
that apology is in order from Mr.
Prater and the paper for over-react-
ing without any study or proper re-
search into the matter. Perhaps this
will serve as a lesson that will pr2-
vent the lapse of journalistic efforts
in the future.

Brymesser Defends PiKA

Position On Elections

To the Editor of The Ring-um Phi:

To begin with I must say that |
was turned right off by Alan Pra-
ter’s letter to the editor in the No-
vember 4, 1970 issue of The Ring-
tum Phi. Mr. Prater’s whole story
seems to be based on hearsay, ie.,
“what has been reported to me...”
and “I have been approached .. .”
He presents no solid facts to show
that “one fraternity is able to strong.
arm the election of representatives,”

In the first place, how could one
fraternity accomplish such a monu-
mental task? It might be conceiv-
able, by a far stretch of the imagina-
tion, to give a fraternity the power
to coerce each of its members of a
certain class to vote in a certain way
in their respective class elections;
but how could a fraternity force
anyone else to vote in a prescribed
manner? The idea is completely un-
founded. Where is the evidence?

Secondly, Mr. Prater does not pre-
sent any names to substantiate his
idea; because, he says, he was fe-
quested not to do so. Well, if Mr.
Prater is prepared to bring such a
serious accusation against a frater-
nity, and he certainly has, whether
intentionally or not, he should be
prepared to name names, Obviously,
he is in no position to do so or “the
several freshmen” also realize the
ridiculousness of his accusation and
do not want to be any part of a
smut campaign against a fraternity
or person

Thirdly, Mr. Prater suggests that
“the BE. C, were not the only persons
watching the polls during the run-

offs.” 1 would also like to suggest
this; but, not as Mr. Prater sug
gests, that members of Pi Kappa

Alpha were the only ones doing so
| would like to suggest that mem

bers of every fraternity, which had
pledges running for office, were also
watching the polls very closely.

Fourthly, if Mr. Prater checks
his statistics, he will find that at
least one of the gentlemen running
for office, Tom Faulkner, did re-
ceive a substantial lead in the pri-
mary. His election came as no great
surprise to those who saw these fi-
gures.

Therefore, no sarcastic slurs as to
the ability of the new freshman of-
ficers is needed, i.e., “Well, I sup-
pose much can be attributed to their
abilities—but then, these  abili-
Wh cia

Fifthly, if the rumored conversa-
tion between Mr. Jones and a cer-
tain unnamed freshman did take
place, it was unethical; BUT how
can this be offered as proof that the
entire Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity
was responsible for strong-arming
the election of their pledges as repre-
sentatives?

Finally, 1 would suggest that in
the future, Mr. Prater use facts as
facts and not hearsay and false ac-
cusations as a political springboard!

Howe Questions Arnold,

Calls For Objectivity

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

In response to Mr. Chuck Ar-
nold’s letter to the editor of Novem-
ber 4, 1970, I find occasion to ques-
tion a few of his points and recom-
mendations.

First, 1 question the existence of
“so many” real issues that face the
student body and the University.
Due to the fact that no examples of
such issues were given Mr. Arnold,
I shall go on to what he termed the
“Minor, irritating issues.”

‘Freshman/Sophomore PE, athle-
tic scholarships and University aid
to athletics are all long-standing ad-
ministrative policies. I feel quite cer-
tain that these issues have been de-
bated and questioned for years. Such
issues have died and been resurrect-
ed numerous times even in the one
year that I have been here. I also
wonder at how a school newspaper
would go about reporting such issues
as Freshman/Sophomore P.E. Sure-
ly, it is not news, as such.

Perhaps The Ring-tum Phi could
conduct an opinion poll covering a
cross-section of freshmen and sopho-
mores, asking whether or not these
students favor PE, I needn't even
suggest the outcome such a poll
would produce. (Admittedly, this is
an exaggeration; however, it serves
to clarify my point.)

I do agree with Mr. Arnold, how-
ever, On one point: the newspaper
should present unbiased reports on
issues of this University. That is a
fundamental rule in journalism,
though it is not always practiced by
The Ring-tum Phi.

With all due respect to Mr. Ar-
nold, | would be curious to know
what he considers to be the issues
here at W&L, and how he would at-
tempt to handle them as a news-
paper editor himself.

Stein Lauds ‘Institutions,’

Decries RAC Statements
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

There seems to be a very import-
ant question facing Washington and
Lee and all institutions of higher
learning today. Should a small mi-
nority of non-conformists abolish
the institutions upon which the uni-
versity is based? One such institu-
tion is the Honor System.

The Honor System has been ques-
tioned widely this year at Washing-
ton and Lee. One of these attacks
was circulated by the Revolutionary
Action Council. The letter is con-
cerned on one level with how best a
student may avoid a “bust.” On a
higher level, it is a direct attack on
Washington and Lee and its Honor
System by way of the “pig dorm
counselors.”

The letter encourages the accus-
ed to remain silent when offered the
ultimatum:

We have reliable information that

you have been smoking marijuana

in this room. If you admit it now
you will be brought before the

Student Control Committee. If

you deny it, you will be charged

with an honor violation.

It is evident that the accused has
either been smoking marijuana or
the has not. All he is asked to do is
to tell the truth. That is all the Hon-
or System requires of him in this
situation. If he is innocent, he has
no worry. If he is guilty, he must
suffer the consequences. Thus the ac-
cused have no right to remain sil-
ent.

If a person cannot conform to tell-
ing the truth when he is called upon,
he cannot be a productive part of
this campus, this society, or any
other society. Marijuana laws may
be wrong, but attacking them
through the Honor System and the
dorm counselors is even worse.

thorough agreement with Mr. Stein’s

Usually I try to devote this column
to an at least halfway serious discus-
sion of a topical university question,
but the EC, the administration and
the Now Generation have all been
quiet lately, so there aren't any start-
ling new campus issues to write
about. (This isn’t all bad though. I’ve
often thought that the world would
be better off if there were no need!

Anyway now I have an opportun-
ity to perform a public service for
freshmen and upperclassmen who
don’t know all of the members of
the faculty. Below is a matching
test for students to test their knowl-
edge of faculty personalities. Just
match the professor with the phrase
which best describes him, or some-
thing he’s done.

Games In Newcomb Hall

BY BOB GILL

Those who complain that Wash-
ington and Lee course offerings just
don’t zero in on contemporary prob-
lems would do well to stop by New-
comb Hall any Monday or Wednes-
day night. Behind that crumbling fa-
cade, students of the departments of
politics, sociology and administra-
tion are attempting to come to grips
with that twentieth-century planner’s
nightmare, the American city.

The name of the game (some cai!
it Monopoly) is Envirometrics. Play-
ers in a hypothetical urban set-up
make fundamental decisions con-
cerning the political, economic and
(yes) social administration of their
laboratory city. Players are divided
into teams on the basis of function.
There are teams which act as the
Chairman and City Council, Fi-
nance Department, Public Works
and Safety Department, School De-
partment, Highway Department,

and Planning and Zoning Depart-
ment. As if this weren’t enough, most
teams are responsible for an econo-
mic sector in addition to their de-
partmental duties.

The computer serves as a deposi-
tory for statistics and simulates pos-
sible outside influences which may
affect decisions. For instance, the
School Board may be informed that
old PS 382 burned last night, and
the Highway Department may lose
an occasional bridge to hurricanes.
And then there’s the human factor.
Computers, after all, must be pro-
grammed—and certain of us have
experienced considerable malaise on
viewing the results of a misplaced
dash.

As the game continues, the need
for interaction among departments
becomes evident. To build a new
school, for instance, the School De-
partment must demand an appropria-

THE RING-TUM PHI

   
  

“i
) Markings.

  
 

BY ROBERT BAROODY

I had intended to fill this space
with several personal observations
on the “walking wounded”: our
youthful generation. An account of
how drugs, the war(s), Hendrix, Hef-
ner, Corvairs, and McDonald’s ham-
burgers—certain things mostly uni-
que to American culture—have
shocked, scarred, and fragmented
too many young bodies and souls.
This is an idea what I find simul-
taneously fascinating and disturbing.

But.

It is vital to our mental well-being
to balance occasionally the negative
with the positive. Recently some-
thing very good occurred in Ameri-
ca. This was, and will be the resur-
rection of Muhammad Ali.

Too much has been written about
Ali, the brilliant fighter. There is a
more interesting dimension to this
man; Ali, the American archetype.

Flashback with me to the middle
of the year 1966: a time when Eu-
gene McCarthy began to have sec-
ond thoughts about Vietnam; and
the intellectuals argued about the
obsolescence of the domino theory.
Well, who should come along
and say “I ain’t got no quarrel with
those Viet Congs”? That's right
sports fans, CAS-SEE-USH CLAY!

The liberals, if they ever talked
about the subject of prizefighting at
their cocktail parties, snickered, and
said “Here is this dumb Negro box-
er who somehow arrives at this con-
clusion; what does he know about
the enclave strategy? Tsk, tsk.
George (giggle), why (giggle) don’t
you buy Clay a subscription to The
New Republic, so at least (giggle)
the man can know what he’s talking
about’. Also: ‘He was a good nigger,

In Praise of Ali

Page 3

yeah; but a Muslim Champion!
Quick, bring on the rabbit . . . Cru-
sader Rabbit.’

In retrospect, I think that Ali, a
man who made his living by physi-
cally devastating other grown men,
who possessed an understanding
of life and death far deeper than
anybody would have guessed

Boxing is a brutal profession, yet
in a sense it is a very honest one.
The prizefighter meets his enemy
face to face; however intent upon
hurting his advesary, the boxer reco-
gnizes him as a talented human be-
ing. The “animals” simply do not ap-
proach the championship class. What
disgusted Ali about the army was
the utterly terrible prospect of hav-
ing to kill a man, and an unknown
man at that. There is some consider:
able difference between fighting and
murdering. Hence, a denial by Aii
of the basic American conception of
the enemy. “I ain't got no quarrel
with those Viet Congs.” This, of
course, was not the sole reason for
Ali’s persecution: his departure from
the sports hero stereotype; the hold-
ing of heretically unpopular religious
beliefs; even the clownish disposi-
tion; all these conspired against a
man destined to become a symbol of

the new America.

And now Muhammad Ali is back,
but he’s too damn quiet for my taste.
Is this strange demeanor a product
of maturity or a damaged spirit? The
former option must be our hope; the
latter is frightening. If a man of
Ali’s strength and purity of existence
can be broken by a diseased society,
then what hope is there for the new
niggers? How this country needs
whole men who are able to laugh at
this chaos of modern life.

Harriers Boast 7-3 Record

The W&L cross country team
topped off its 7-3 winning season
with a strong second place finish in
the State Small College Meet held
in last Friday’s drenching downpour
on the rain soaked course at Bridge-
water College.

Freshman Bill Kalal finished Ist for
the Generals and tenth overall at
28:21 in the frantic five-mile race
for the tape, with Co-captain Bill
Wilkinson and Freshman Tom
Young only 18 and 19 seconds be-
hind respectively. Junior Carter
Glass, Sophomore Bob Sherwood,
and Freshman Tim Kearney con-
stituted the General's second tight
group with only 13 seconds between
Glass and Kearney, followed less
than 35 seconds later by Freshman
Jim Horner and Co-captain Paul
Wilber.

The Generals were beaten only
by the powerful Bridgewater squad,

 

All sports events are posted on the
athletic board in front of the Co-op.

 

which edged the bulk of its runners
into the first seven places.

It should be noted that Bridge-
water does give athletic scholarships
to its runners, which may account
in part for its strength. Except for
Bridgewater, however, the Generals
literally ran away from Roanoke
College, Lynchburg College, Christo-
per Newport College, Madison Col-
lege, and most importantly, Eastern
Mennonite College, the first time in
11 years that W&L has defeated the
perennially formidable E.M.C. har-
riers.

his past weekend, the Generals
travelled to St. Louis for the C.A.C.
meet on a relatively flat course at
Washington University, where they
edged out Sewanee and soundly
trounced Southwestern for a third
place finish behind second place
Centre and favored Washington Uni-
versity.

LaRue’s Press Box

Leading the Generals, Co-captain
Bill Wilkinson captured the sixth
place individual award for his 22:15
time on the four-mile course, fo!-
lowed only 7 seconds later by Bill
Kalal, who earned the eighth place
individual award in this his very
first C.A.C. competition. Running
third for the Generals and 13th over-
all was Bob Sherwood, followed by
a tightly knit pack of Generals, Car-
ter Glass, Tom Young, Jim Horner,
and Co-captain Paul Wilber, for
18th, 20th, 21st, and 22nd places
respectively in the field of 35.

According to Co-captains Wilbur
and Wilkinson, the credit for the har-
riers’ unusual performance this year
can only go to an outstanding group
of freshmen, most of whom had been
experienced runners in high school
and all of whom worked with dogged
determination to develop their phy-
sical toughness and mental stamina.

Still another Southeastern Confer-

The Rebels, without star attraction

And to go out on a limb, Syracuse
will go after San Diego State in the

The generals felt the absence of
Bruce Green who injured his kid-
ney in the Sewanee game the week
before last. Green will be unable
to finish the season, but he has al-
ready compiled an impressive re-
cord . . . 28 receptions for 395
yards and 3 touchdowns.

Southwestern at Memphis clinch-
ed at least a tie for the CAC title
last week by romping over the deter-
mined but sluggish Washington and
Lee Generals, 42-14.

The Generals’ passing combina-
tion, Steve Fluharty and Steve Me-

haffey, continued their record-set-
ting pace while the rest of the of-
fense lacked the needed backup

punch, Fluharty will remain high
among the nation’s passers with his
18 of 34 attempts for 169 yards.
Mahaffey snared 13 of those aerials
for 104 yards.

The first quarter saw W&L on the
defense most of the time. Southwes-
tern scored first on a cheap flat pass
that went for 49 yards, with 6:18 re-
maining in the quarter. The P.A.T.
was true and Southwetsern was sit-
ting on a 7-0 lead.

But, as the second quarter open-
ed, George Harris intercepted a
stray pass and returned it to the
Southwestern 47. Succeeding on
many third down clutch situations,
the Generals drove to the seven yard
line, with a first and goal. The next
play was most likely the game’s turn-
ing point. Fluharty threw to a wide-
open Mahaffey for what seemed to
be the tying score, but an offensive
pass interference call nullified the
play. Downs then claimed the drive
on the 10. Southwestern turned about
face and scored only 30 seconds
later on an 87 yard pass and run.
The conversion made the score 14-0,
instead of the possible 7-7 tie.

Still in the second quarter, South-
western scored its third T.D. with
3:21 remaining in the half on an-
other long pass, this one of 38 yards.
The kick was good and the Generals
were further behind, 21-0. Yet, on
the kickoff, Mark Lane broke loose
for 31 yards to the Generals’ 49. In
only five plays, with Fluharty mak-

ing himself most of the drive, Doug
Gossmann plunged four yards for
W&L’'s first legal points. Doug
Ohase’s boot was good and the half
ran out to Southwestern’s lead, 21-7.

Receiving the opening kickoff, the
Generals drove 47 yards on the
ground and in the air to the South-
western 22. Fluhanty scrambled from
there out of the pocket on a pass
play and entered the end zone virtu-
ally untouched. Chase’s P.A.T. was
true and the Blue pulled a bit closer,
21-14.

That was the extent throughout of
W&L’s offensive show as Southwes-
tern took over and controlled the
ball over 75 per cent of the time.
Runs of one and 15 yards and a pass
of 15 concluded Southwestern’s and
the game’s total scoring. All the con-
versions were good and the score
ended 42-14.

This week, the Generals conclude
their season against Washington Uni-
versity, which is the only team that
can tie Southwestern University for
the Conference title. Game time is
2 p.m. at Wilson Field.

The Washington game will be ex-
tremely important as far as the

CAC’s are concerned, but in another
respect this game is even more im-
portant. It is the final game for ten
seniors.

Just a note—field goals are in this year.
Saturday, Cloyce Hinton of Ole Miss booted
a 58 yarder; Sunday, 43 year old George
Blanda kicked a 52-yard field goal to beat
Cleveland 23-20; and the most amazing event
of the weekend occurred in New Orleans as
the Saints’ Tom Dempsey, with a club foot,
set an all-time distance record with an as-

clude any possibility of outdoor rec-
reation benefits.

Of the lower reservoir, he writes:
“The lower damsite touches the Na-
tional Forest and is only a short dis-
tance from Douthat State Park’s
lake and the new Gathright Dam
reservoir, not to mention scenic
Goshen Pass. To argue that this sec-
tion of the state needs more recrea-
tion facilities would be difficult.”

Lyle, along with many conserva-
tionists views with apprehension the
problem of drawdown in the lower
lake. “If VEPCO is required to aug-
ment downstream flow in summer,
there will be large areas of mudflats
visible during the peak recreation
season.”

Lyle feels that “the Valley in its
present condition abounds in wild-
life. Deer, bear, turkey, and trout.
Visitors are struck by its clear river,
stone fences, and lush fields.” This
opinion is also shared by Student
Body President Fran Lawrence,
head of W&L student efforts to fight
VEPCO.

Lawrence told the Ring-tum Phi
that if the project were to be success-
fully defeated, students and residents
of this area would have to reduce
the mounting drain on electrical
power. “The irony is,” Fran said,
“that while VEPCO screams for
more power, at the same time they
put up billboards encouraging peu
ple to air-condition their homes.”

University Announces
Agreement to Maintain

Exchange Program

Washington and Lee University
will participate again with seven ol-
her colleges (Davidson, Hampden-
Sydney, Hollins, Mary Baldwin,
Randolph-Macon, Randolph-Macon
Woman's, and Sweet Briar) in an ex-
change program during the 1971-72
academic year.

This program is designed primar-
ily for juniors. Exchanges shall or-
dinarily be for a full academic year,
but shorter periods may be consider-
ed if the calendars of the two schools
involved make this possible.

Additional information and cata
logues of the participating colleges
are available in the Office of the
Associate Dean of the College.

Applications are to be submitted
on or before February 10, 1971 to
the home institution of the student
who wishes to participate. The ap-
plication must indicate the student's
proposed course of study.

Charlie Byrd Quintet
At Openings Concert

(Continued from Page 1)
Aquarius” from “Hair,” the quin-
tet’s interpretative ability and techni-
cal virtuosity are consistently appar-
ent,

The quintet is composed of Char-
lie Byrd on an amplified 6-string gui-
tar and a classical guitar, his broth-
er Joe Byrd on electric bass, Mario
Darpino on flute and alto flute, Hal
Posey on flugelhorn and trumpet
and Bill Reichenbach on drums.

Long experience together that in-
cludes tours throughout the world
has made the quintet especially pro-
ficient at the organized improvisa-
tion particular to the jazz idiom.

Byrd, who studied with Segovia,
plays quite well. He has a fine and
firm technique. There are, however,
several guitarists around today that
play as well. His chief distinction is
that he and his group combine the
classical and jazz works on the same
program, and play each type of
music superbly.

lickets for Friday nights concert
are now on sale in the Co-op at the
price of $10 per couple. They will
also be sold at the door at the same
price. In addition, Dance Plans may
still be purchased for the rest of the
concert season at $35. Some four
more concerts are planned in addi-
tion to Byrd’s performance.

‘Patton’ Producer, VMI
Alumnus, Participates In
Founders’ Day Activities

Frank McCarthy, producer of the
widely-publicized recent movie “Pat-
ton,” is on hand for the Founders’
Day convocation at VMI today.

Virginia Military Institute cele-
brates its I3ist year today, tracing
its history back to November 11,
1838 when Cadet John B. Strange
relieved the arsenal guard and be-
came the first VMI sentry. The
school entered its first session with
a total enrollment of 23 cadets and a

faculty membership of two instruc-
tors.

The featured speaker at today’s 11
a.m. convocation, McCarthy is a
1933 graduate of VMI who went on
to receive his M.A. at the Univer-
sity of Virginia. Later he returned
to VMI for a time as an instructor
and tactical officer.

On entering the Army in 1940,
McCarthy served with another VMi
graduate, General of the Army
George C. Marshall as assistant sec-
retary to the Anmy’s general staff,
and later as secretary. During this
time, he rose through the ranks to
become a brigadier general in the
Army Reserve.

Following World War Il, McCar-
thy was appointed an executive and
producer with Twentieth Century-
Fox studios in 1948, a position he
has held in that company ever since.
In 1954, he was named an assistant
secretary in the Department of State
under Secretary of State James F.
Byrnes.

He retired from the Army in cere-
monies held at VMI in 1963.

The film “Patton” represents, ac-
cording to McCarthy, a long-held
desire to make a motion picture
about the famed general and the
Second World War.

tion from the Finance Department,
and arrange through the appropriate
teams to buy land, develop utility
and highway service for it, and have
it zoned—all before the new school
can be built. Various teams jockey
for positions of influence and, as ‘n
any urban government situations,
some corruption develops.

Envirometrics as a system is still
in the developmental stage. Viewed
by many scholars as an attempt to
bring order out of an otherwise chao-
tic situation, its possibilities are vir-
tually limitless. It has drawn nation-
wide attention to both the problems
and the promise of the American
city. As John Chancellor of NBC
News said in a recent broadcast,
“This is not the city of the future,
but it’s a step in that direction. What
they hope to produce here is a uni-
fied theory of city technology.”

What Envirometrics is doing, then,
is highly important to us all. As
Chancellor says, “If they don’t do
it, or if somebody doesn’t do it, the
cities may stop working, and where
will urban America be then?”
