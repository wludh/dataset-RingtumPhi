On Constitution

BY GLENN AZUMA

Co-Chairman, Committee for
Constitutional Change

In viewing the past few years al
Washington and Lee it is impossible
‘to ignore the change in the composi-
ition of the student body, Not only ‘s
there a greater diversity in social
and economic backgrounds, but
there has been an attendant diversi
fication of opinion and outlook, This
change provided the primary impe'-
us for the constitutional amend-
ations proposed by the Committee
for Constitutional Change.

It is our belief that the structure
of student government as represent-
ed in the present Executive Commit-
tee cannot be responsive or repre-
sentative in light of the increased di-
versity of the student body. Hope-
fully, the changes which we have
proposed will provide a greater de-
gree of responsive representation
and a sensitivity to the sentiments of
the student body. At the same time it
is hoped that these changes will cn
courage greater leadership and =x-
panded participation in student gov-
ernmem,

If these objectives are attained
the structure of student government
will be more relevant to the major-
ity of the students and the inoreas-
ingly popular and possibly valid be-
lief that student government is mere-
ly an instance of comic farce may be
laid to rest. There is an attendant
though less apparent consideration
and that is our hope that the action
of our proposals may stimulate a
wider assessment of the relation of
student government to the univer-
sity as a Whole.

The most significant alteration in
the character of student government
follows from the separation of the
judicial functions and responsiiv ities
from the legislative. We propo: the
creation of a separate Honor Court
and a Student Senate.

The Honor Court will have 12
mrenrbers. One justice will be erected
from each undergraduate class and
the law school. In addition, 4 jus-
tices will be chosen from the mem-
bership of the Senate by an eloction
of that body. The Student Body of-
ficers (Presidem, V. P. & Secreimry)
will be ex officio voting members
of the Court. In all matters pertain-
ing to the Honor Sysiem the court
will have sole jurisdiction.

The Student Senate will
32 voting members including the
V.P. and the Secretary with the
President of the Student Body as the
presiding officer. Six representuives
will be elected from each class and
the law school, All Student commit-
tees will be placed under the author-
ity of the senate and will be ‘argely
composed of the membership of
that body. However, appo’ ronents
from the student body at large can
be made to the committees if such
action is considered necessary by the
Senate. The chairmanships of these
committees will be dete: .rined by
the approval of the Senate upon ap-
plications from any inicrested stu-
dent.

There are two possible problems
which should be considered. Ihe
most significant one pertainin: to
the availability of qualified and en
thusiastic individuals which are nec
essary for the effective operation of
this expanded swudent government
it has been suggesicd that the in
creased base of student government
proposed will merely result in the
fragmentation of responsibility. This
fragmentation would result inn
creased apathy and evenually couse
the collapse of the entire stru.iure
This, certainly, is a powib'iiy and
its destructive consequences cannot
be ignored

Equal considerwtion should be
viven in regard to the effect of the
separation of powers upon the integ
rity of the Honor System. Kt ha»
boon asserted that the disussoccation

consim cl

of the Honor Court from all legisla
tive maetiess may only further
sirengthen the moorrest asooation

of the Honor System with an “in
quisitional court,” Any change whieh
furthers this association would, in
my opinion, be destructive to a vital
part of the university
These are two of the
portant objections which have been
made to our regarding
our proposals, While there are other

THE RING-TUM PHI

The “Contact '71” symposium on
the “Crisis in Higher Education”
was highlighted this week by two
prominent and controversial figures,
one from education and the othe.
from government. Visiting Lexing-
ton on Friday was Dr. Charles Ham
ilton, a noted black scholar and
black studies advocate. On Monday
Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon,
liberal Republican and a_ leading
anti-war legislator, addressed the
university.

British Funds
Open to Juniors

The Richmond branch of the Eng-
lish Speaking Union plans again to
send one or more students to study
during the summer in Great Britian.

Juniors who are less than 23 years
old by next June are invited to com-
pete.

Candidates should demonstrate:
1. Literary and scholastic abilities
and attainments.

2. Qualities of character, truth,
courage, devotion to duty, kindli-
ness, and unselfishness, and fellow-
ship.

3. Instinots to lead and desire io
take an interest in his companions.
4. Physicial vigor, as shown by in-
terest in sports or other activities.
5. Pleasing personality.

The Rhodes Committee, Profes-
sors Jenks, Coulling, and Martin,
will interview those interested and
is empowered to nominate one for
WAL. Students interested should
see Dr. Jenks in Washington 31 be-
fore January 25.

Poco, Livingston Taylor Will

BY ROY CARLTON

Fancy Dress may have died, but
there won't be a dearth of music al
Washington and Lee this February.
lhree concerts are scheduled for the
coming month, two of them on con-
scoutive evenings. February 5 will
greet Livingston Taylor, brother of
the popular James Taylor, to Dore
mus gym. The following nights’ con-
cert will fewture the Allman Brothers
Band as the tempo switches from
country to progressive blues rock. A
luter February 20 concert will be
given by Pooo, the country-flavored

heir to the music of the Buffaly
Springfield.
The appearance of Livingston

Taylor at WAL should satisfy the
numerous students who have been
clamoring to have James Taylor in
concert. The similarities in the styles,
personulities and music of the broth
ers is unmistakable. Each plays sim
ple folk music tinged with North
Carolina country. There is the same
naive simplicity in their songs, and
deep sincerity in their voices.

Yet, Liv Taylor is more than jus.
a substitute for James. He is an ea
tremely talented, perhaps superior
performer, in his own right. They

vanguard of the civil rights move-
ment and of black intellectual cir-
cles, has co-authored a book with
Stokely Carmichael, “Black Power:
Politics of Liberation in America.”
Raised in the South and educated at
the Tuskeegee Institute and at the
University of Chicago, Hamilton is
now a professor of political science
at Columbia University.

Hamilton, in his formal remarks
in Lee Chapel, urged a “changing
and expanding of curricula” with re-
gard to black studies. He argued that
reservations held by those who ques-
tion the legitimacy of courses in
black culture are unfounded on both
intellectual and moral grounds.

The black spokesman pointed to
a study of various colleges and un:
versities he recently made. He found
nearly all “inadequate” in a relevant
curriculum for bhacks.

He said that courses in American
Negro and African history, culture,
language, music and art should be
included, “though not necessarily in
a separate department.” He main-
tained that such courses “would not
only benefit black students in acquu -
ing a pride of their race, but would
also help whites” in reaching his-
torical perspective and an apprecia-
tion of black culture.

Senator Hatfield, speaking before
a substantial crowd in Evans Dining
Hall, warned that “all education, o

concert is To that; a Livingston
Paylor concert. The basic themes of
their music are different, too. While
the lyrics of James are filled with
the intensity of his love for his dead
girlfriend Suzanne, Liv is more light-
hearted, When his songs do deal with
love, it is an innocent, enjoyable,
lessinvolved love, without the
moreseness and depth of his broth-
ers songs.

Although the Allman Brothers
Band hails from Macon, Georgia,
their musical birthright is San Fran-
cisco psych. The leaders of the six
man group, Duane and Greg All-
man, started as memebrs of the
San Francisco based Hour Glass.
Their supporting members have also
been into music for years as mom-
bers of various soul and blues bonds.

The driving impetus for the
Band's music is provided by Duwne
Allman, one of the finest guiiarists
in all of rock, who has chosen as his
instrument the electric stide guitar,
potentially the most sensational
soundmaker of all. While Johnny
Winter may turn us on to the flashy
brillance of his slide guitar pyro’ech
nics, Duane Allman seems intention.
ally to under-emphasize just those

primary, secondary, and higher
levels, is in deep trouble . . . with

Hatfield blamed both administra
tors and politicians “for failing to re-
examine our own priorities an!
goals, to redefine our mission in edu-
cation to upgrade and improve hu-
man life.”

The Oregon senator emphasized
that dollars alone would not cure
the crisis facing colleges today, but
the cniticized federal aid to higher
education as being oriented too
much in the direction of defense re-
search. “We must realize where this
government funding is being ex-
pended,” he said. “Starting in 1958,
grants totaled 750 milhion, and now
reach 4.7 billion. But now, as then.
% of this total is for research.”

“We cannot allow the government
contract to become a substitute for
intellectual discovery,” Hatfield con-
tinued. “Qan we not solve our hu-
man problems with the same spirii
Which made us first in space?”

Just last fall it was suspected by
many that Duane would abandon
the Allman Brothers Band to join
Eric Clapton's new group, Derek
and the Dominoes. But after record-
ing that group's new album in Octo-

‘ber (which inchides the hit single

“After Midnight”), Duane decided
to return to his own group.

Vocals are almost by definition
the weak spot in any white blues
band, since pronunciations, inflec
tions and word usage are not so casy
to transmit across cultural barriers
as the non-verbal ubterings of musi-
cal instruments. Either you got into
a black imitative role as singer (a le
Johnny Winter, John Maya'l and
David Clayton-Thomas), or you
take what you can from the biues

Allman has to be counted among
those in the former category, but
substantial praise is due him for the
restraint and dignity he brings to the
role; watching him sing is a cultural
shock experience. He “sounds” of

David Donald Delivers
Founders’ Day Address

Dr. David Donald, a leading au-
thority on the Civil War and Recon-
struction periods, addressed the
100th Founder's Day Convocation
Tuesday. The ceremony, annually
celebrated on General Lee’s birth-
day, carried an added significance as
the formal commemoration of the
centennial of the title change from
Washington College to Washington
and Lee University by act of the Vir-
ginia legislature.

Dr. Donald, presently the Harry
C. Black professor of American his-
tory at The Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity, spoke in Evans Dining Hall on
“From One Reconstruction to An-
other: Lessons from Robert E. Lee.”

The author of many historical stu-
dies, Professor Donald was co-

pear

more out of the Ray Oharies sound
than out of Jimmy Smith. Second
lead guitarist Dick Betts is a super-
lative instrumentalist in his own
right, and his inclusion reinforces

author of the defensive text on the
“Civil War and Reconstruction” and
was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in
1961 for his biography of “Charles
Sumner and the Coming of the
Civil War.”

Following the opening remarks
delivered by President Robert E. R.
Huntley, Dr. Donald offered his
view on reconstruction in the South
and the failure of Southerners to
heed Lee's advice on political and
racial reconciliation.

“It is easy now,” he said, “to sum-
marize the labors of the revisionist
historians, many of themselves quite
Southern, who had to challenge the
sacred taboos and myths” of the old
South. Most of their efforts, he
maintained, have been directed to-
ward refuting the stereotypes of the
reconstruction era in the South.

“Revisionists have disproved fa”
more than they have proved,” he
continued. “And General Lee’s views
on political and economic issues of
the era have been sadly neglected
by historians.”

Dr. Donald noted that Lee always
stressed one theme following the
war: that of reconciliation with ihe
Union, without bitterness toward the

people of the North. He quoted a

post-war letter in which Lee, tien
president of the college, encouraged
Virginia's Governor Letcher to take
the dreaded oath to the Urion:
“True patriotism sometimes impells
men to take action exactly oppo ite
to a previous one . . . we must De
able to adjust to a new order.”

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

January 20, 1971

For Your Information, Sirs...

Issue: Relevancy of R.O.T.C. in the Washington and Lee cur
riculum.

Opinion of “Not Relevant”: Mr. Gingold and Mr. Newman.

Opinion of “Relevant”: The Ring-tum Phi.

Look up for a moment at the masthead above our editorial
column. It reads “Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi,” not
‘Both Sides of the Coin.” Oddly enough, two writers of letters
to the newspaper this week seem appalled that these column:
are reserved for our editorial opinion.

One of the cheapest short cuts in winning any argument is
to (a) claim that your opposition is not presenting “the facts”
on your side and therefore is not at all credible (perhaps entitl-
ed) in his opinion, (b) claim that the other side knows as well
as you do that they have violated some code of elusive ethics in
the expression of their opinion because they haven't taken into
account “the facts” (i.e., your point of view), (c) pompously
proclaim that the opposition has presented false issues and that
your issues are the right ones, ergo, the opinion of the other
side must be discounted.

Well, maybe these writers are interested in winning an
argument. If that’s the case, we congratulate them on their
interest. But why don’t they argue instead of carp about how
we missed their interpretation and then kindly offer their help
in enlightening us? We'd be pleased to print their opinions
anytime in our newspaper.

After the dust settles on what those writers feel the “real
issues” are, our editorial of last week stands as our estimation
of what the R.O.T.C. mini-crisis is all about.

Staff Editorial

Once Again, Remarks On Apathy

Student apathy has long been a topic of considerable popu-
larity here. For years, students have found themselves sub-
jected to great deal of reproach from faculty and administra-
tors, as well as considerable self-condemnation from their peers
through letters and editorials. We would be the first to admit,
however, that much of this has been warranted.

Last Friday, Dr. Charles Hamilton, Professor of Urban
Affairs at Columbia, spoke as a guest of “Contact '71” on the
subject of the Black Studies Programs. No newcomer to the
field, Dr. Hamilton has literally established the black studies
program at Columbia, and has had much to do with establish-
ing the program at Harvard.

W&L offers only one course directly concerning the his-
tory and culture of the American black and that course is of-
fered only in the spring. In the past several years the Univer-
sity has given much consideration to incorporating addi-
tional courses into its curricula.

It is interesting to note, however, that only five members of
the faculty or administration were present Friday evening for
Dr. Hamilton's address; although upwards of 20 turned out
for the basketball game one hour later.

\t a time when the question of broadening present curri-
cula to include additional black studies courses is before them,
it seems rather odd that so few educators are willing to edu
cate themselves not only about the various rationale behind
black studies programs (Dr. Hamilton listed six); but also
about the advantages and disadvantages inherent in each.

Is the faculty, excepting those five who were present, above
furthering their own education, or do they perhaps suffer from
the same malady with which their students are so often evi
dently afflicted ? C.F.H.

Contact’s Second Week In Review

BY DAVID OLSON

Monday night in Evans Hall the
Republican Senator from Oregon
Mark Hatfield gave what I thought
to be the best speech so far in this
year’s “Contact” program. We'!
known for his opposition to the War
in Vietnam and the invasion of
Cambodia he also showed his per-
spiracity in the field of education.
He pointed out that the federal gov-
ernment has not in recent years been
giving enough to institutions of
higher education.

While realizing that, he also point-
ed out that dollars are not enough,
that the universities of this country
that are in such financial trouble
must also realize the importance of
human needs of the students of the
society as a Whole. He also said that
ithe political situation in this country

—e

‘

is in just as much trouble, What it
all came down to is that there has
been a lack of moral leadership on
the part of the White Hiouse and
that somehow the spiritual life of
this country has lagged. We must, he
pointed out, concern ourselves with
humanizing our institutions to the
needs of the people,

What made this such an enjoyable
speech to hear was the fact that Sen.
Hatfield did not pull punches. He
stated the unfortunaite fact that thos:
who screamed the loudest last May
somehow got lost on into the fall,
He cited the fact that in the recent
campaign for Senator in New York,
Conservative candidate James Buck-
ley had more “young people” work
ing for him than did either Goode’!
or Democratic candidate Richard
Ottinger. He deplored this because
he felt that in some way these candi-

dates had been deserted, He did not
pull punches with his colleagues in
the Senate. He stated that they had
deserted him in his and Senator
Goldwater’s quest to pass a bill for
an all volunteer Army.

Senator Hatfield certainly earned
my respect for his willingness to talk
and his willingness to criticize where
he felt something was wrong even in
his own party. It seems that Senator
Hatfield’s willingness to talk is a
'eason that could be learned by other
members of his party.

Last Friday night in the Chapel
Dr. Charles Hamilton gave an eru-
dite address on the Black Student
movement and its effect on the Aca-
demy. While it might seem that this
influenc ehas been only to disrupt,
Dr. Hamilton pointed out that the
demands made by Black students «1¢
‘legitimate and necessary, These are

 

Dr. Harold Taylor, former president of Sarah Lawrence College, will speak on “The Student Revolution” Friday at Lee Chapel

necessary because the institutions
involved need to be forced into a
necessary study of the Black in this
country. There is a great need he
said for a gathering of empirical
datia on the Black.

What the university has to do is to
re-examine its “normative” values so
that it can accommodaite Black stu-
dies programs. He expressed the
warning that schools that cannot af-
ford a good Black studies program
should not attempt it. What has hap-
pened is that too many schools have
tried and have not put forth good
programs. But above all else the
Black student movement has raised
relevant and important questions
for the academic community that
has forced the Academy into dealing
with questions about the Black that
have been overlooked for too long.

 

hat’s To Come In Contact ’71

BY MATT COLE

Tonight, a subject will be dis
cussed that has been mentioned by
every one of the speakers of CON-
TACT to date. Dr. Arthur G. Han-
sen, the President of Georgia Tech,
will talk on the problems of a tech-
nological society, with particular at-
tention to the problems of pollution,
aml! the environment.

A noted authority on the subjec!
of the inter-relation of technolog,
and social sciences, he feels very
strongly that though tremendous
strides have been made in the fields
of technology. and though techno
logy has solved many problems. it
has in turn created many problems
In addition, he feels that people thai
deal with technology often are so
caught up in their work, that they
forget to look at the whole picture of
society. Dr. Hansen will talk on
“TECHNOLOGY OUR TERROR
OR OUR TRIUMPH.”

Dr. Arthur G. Hansen was named
President of Georgia Tech after serv
img as dean of engineering there for
three years. In being named to the
job, he was elevated over four vice
presidents of the institution. H.s

ideas have gained him wide respec

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

With regard to your editorial
about the petition to end ROTC

| think you should have told your
readers that at no time did you
make an effort to seek out both sides
of the issue. Your editorial was no*
based on issues we afe stressing,
only the issues you would like pec-
ple to think we are stressing.

You know as well as | that if a
radio station in this country did
what your paper has done with that
editorial, the FCC would have a
good case for revoking the station's
license. Any time you feel an obliga-
tion to “seek out” the facts on our

More Quirks & Quibble

(Editor’s Note: The following is
a continuation of that all-too-brief
beginning made last December to-
ward carrying The Ring-tum Phi out
of its morass of bone-dry reporting
and into the sopping-new Elysian
Fields of ecstatic news writing.

We regret to report the almost
complete silence with which the first
effort was greeted, and take this oc-
casion to warn our readers that un-
less this offering rates a hue and cry
the like of which this campus has
not seen since the railroads were
asked to give a rising vote of thanks
to the ATO pledge trainer, we will
inflict this God-awful thing on you
in every way possible, up to and in-

dropping it out of airplanes.)

Having kept our erstwhile readers
in suspense this long, we cannot pro-
long the torture too much more, and
will hereby break down and admit

Huntley Discusses Ford Madox Ford Book

When H. Robert Huntley left the
University of Wisconsin in 1962, he
took with him a half-finished doc-
toral dissertation on Ford Madox
Ford and the germ of a further study
that would take nine years for frui-
tion. The result, The Alien Prota-
gonists of Ford Madox Ford pub-
lished by the University of Norta
Carolina, and now available, as-
sumed its final form at the Univer-
sity of North Carolina and at Duke
University during Dr. Huntley’s re-
cently ended leave of absence from
W&L.

Ford, an English novelist who
thought out his novels in French be-
fore writing them in English, is best
known for his role as an editor dur-
ing the early 1900's. His magazine,
The English Review included articles
by Thomas Hardy, Joseph Conrad,
John Galsworthy, W. H. Hudson,
and H. G. Wells. He is credited with
having discovered P. Wyndham
Lewis, Ezra Pound, and D. H. Law-
rence and was first to encourage
Ernest Hemingway.

In an interview with The Ring-tum
Phi, Huntley described the biggest
‘boost to his study as the oppor-
tunity to revisit the books he had cut
his teeth on as a boy: “My father’s
shelves were filled with people like
H. G. Wells, Bulwer-Lytton and a
tot of third and even fourth rate
Victorian novelists that no one even
talks about anymore, but they were
the sort of thing I grew up with.
And, lo and behold, I found that I
could use these things. A lot of the
time second and third rate writers
can give more insight into what is
going on in a period than first rank
literary people.”

The book will be valuable to stu-
dents of Ford but also to anyone in-
terested in the transitional period of
history between the late 1890's and
the first two decades of the 20th cen-
tury.

Huntley devotes much of the book
to discussion of prevalent theories
of history in the late 19th century,
especially the doctrines of Hegel,

American Oil Grant
Awarded To W@L;
Will Help McCormick

An unrestricted grant of $2,500
has been awarded to WAL by the
American Oil Foundation, President
Robert E .R. Huntley has announc-
ed.

The gift was presented by H. H.
(eq) Scott, representing the Founda-
tion.

The gram will be used, President
Huntley said, to help meet financia!
needs in the university's Cyrus Hall
McCormick Library.

Blaine J. Yarrington of Chicago,
president of the foundation's board
of trustees, said the gift to Washing-
ton and Lee is one of 110 being
made to outstanding colleges and
universities throughout the nation, in
recognition of the acute financial
pressures private higher education
must face.

and Schopenhauer but only in the
popularized versions circuluted
among the general public of that
period. “By the time the ideas that
influenced Ford had filtered down
through the popular understanding, ’
Huntley said, “they had become so
warped, so distorted from what had
originally been intended that they
bore little resemblance to those (ori-
ginal) ideas,”

Huntley motes that Ford himself
made little pretense of scholarshir,
once drolly commenting: “All of the
notes I ever made for my historical
novels were contiained on the backs
of three or four calling cards and
then were only dates.”

In truth Ford drew elaborate
tables to aid his framing each pro-
‘tagonist in a carefully etched histori-
cal and psychological landscape.

Huntley argues that the protago-
nists, though variable in temper-
ment share commonality as victims
of Fordian future shock.

“Almost inevitably,” Huntley said,
“Ford will take a character and he
will give him the characteristics of,
say, the late resistance and will put
that figure into an uncongenial tine
slot somewhat later in history, and
there all of the attributes that wou!d
have been advantages in another age
‘become detriments . . . What For
gains by doing this is that that figure
becomes a satiric device by which to
see certain unadmirable qualities in
that period. Inevitably his alien prv-
tagonist is a very admirable sort of
person and the particular cultural
milieu in which that person finds
himself is not at all admirable. *

One is apt to remember Mark
Twain's very different use of time
travel in A Connecticut Yankee ‘n
King Arthur’s Coart in which a mod-
ern-day technocrat exploits medieval
ignorance and superstitution. in re-
sponse to this Huntley said, “Twain's
knowledge of the Middle Ages, as
any Twain scholar would admit, was
extremely superficial and his sort of
crude ironies are really very puerile
things.

“This so outraged Ford that he
determined to write a novel depict-
ing what the Middle Ages were
really like, and he too took a figure
from the modern period and sent
him back into time. But whereas the
Yankee dominates the age through
his superior intelligence and moral
superionity-attributes which we like
to feel make us the finest example of
the whole evolutionary process .. .
Ford shows the modern man as be-
ing ineffective, weak, superficial, ef.

fete, and incapable of doing any-
thing once he steps out of a subway
tube.”

“Ford would loved to have been a
medieval man. To him it was one of
the last periods in world history
when there was a social system that
a man could live by and he knew
how to make judgments between
right and wrong, good and evil, be-
cause there was a standard that he
could believe in, not the modern
brand of effete wishy washy agnosti-

cism.” His protagonist of the Medie-
val period, is able to survive only
after embracing the medieval; Fordi-
tudes of muscle, ethical integrity and
faith,

Students who know Huntley's lec-
ture style will recognize the book's
cogent reasoning and concise prose.
Huntley has deftly treated Ford’s
‘lifelong fascination with the determi-
nistic forces of fate, revealing the
protagonists as tragic and at the
same time strangely contemporary.

 

With Malice Toward Some

A Little Insensitivity

BY JEFFREY B. SPENCE

I don’t know how many of you
read the material on the various
bulletin ‘boards around the camp-
us. However, if every once in a
while you should, you will find that
some very interesting reading is in
store for you. If you want only min-
or excitement there are always the
E.C. or University announcements.
One may find further diversion in re-
viewing the various petitions that are
posted, all of which eagerly await
your signature.

However, if you are an avid bul-
letin board follower you can have
tthe great privilege of reading the
continuing adventures of the John
Birch Society. Persual of this litera-
ture is sure to bring you many mom-
ents of delightful humor, wnfortun-
ately the informative quality of these
messages tends to be nil. The man
responsible for this weekly levity is
Mr. William Melhany, who is the
head of the Society's local campus
chapter.

The most recent publication by
Mr. Melthany’s group is entitled:
“Another Warning About Sensitivity
Training,” which appears to be a
follow-up to an earlier Birch publi-
cation. The warning we are given is
not to enter sensitivity training
groups. The reasoning behind this
warning is that they are actually at-
wek groups for the purpose of de-
stroying a person’s hand and forc-
ing him to submit to the terror of
his surrounding peers.

He further warns us that these
groups are strongly similar to group
procedures used for brainwashing
that were found under Hitler and
are presently found under Chairman
Mao. This is all a gross distortion.

Cook's reaction to the Trouba-

surprise at the professional attitude
of all concerned.”

According to Cook, the physical
twyout of the Troubadour Theatre is
“better than that at many other
places.” It “provides a great deal of
freedom, but there is a need for
more rehearsal space and movement
class areas.” He feels that this defici
ency can be remedied either by ex-
panding the present building or ac-
quiring another small building to
use as a rehearsal area.

Sensitivity training is a personal
growth process whereby the indivi-
dual learns to increase his sensitivity
to persons around him. It further
teaches the individual new forms of
self expression and develops one’s
ability to listen, observe, and to trust
others.

The agencies in this country which
are recognized as authorized training
Organizations are sponsored by an
ecumenical group of religious in-
stitutions which represent all of the
major Jewish and Christian faiths.
The two largest of these organiza-
tions are National Training Labs, or
N.T.L., and the Middle Atlantic
Training Conference, or M.A.T.C.
N.T.L., the oldest, is a subdivision
of the National Council of Churches.
Obviously, these organizations are
neither Fascist nor Communist.

When going on a sensitivity ses-
sion no one is expected to sell his
soul to the group he is in. He is also
not expected to give up his indivi-
dual rights or beliefs so as to gain
favor from the group or any other
individual. However, it seems that
the Birchers would have us believe
that these sessions are to create
some kind of collective slavocracy
Where one loses his individuality.
One is not expected to lose his mind
nor allow himself to be pushed to in-
sanity and there are professional
trainers to make sure this does not

I know what I'm saying because i
have extensive experience with this
type of training. If professionals run
tthe sessions then there will be no
trouble, if one goes to something
run by amatuers then one is bound
to have danger. N.T.L. and M.A.T.C.
are professional organizations.

Mr. Mclithany claims this insight
into sensitivity training because he
states he has studied this process
and has attended a training lab run
by official Esalen Institute trainees.
This is meaningiess. One cannot
study sensitivity training, it must be
experienced. | question Mr. Mcll-
hany’s experience when he says he
attends sessions run by official
trainees. I am an official trainee of
M.A.T.C, but that does not make
me a trainer. It is by official trainers
that one must do sensitivity trainir g.

The art of half-truths seems to
permeate this most resort piece of
John Birch Society literature. 1:
even extends to the questionable
chiim that to remove or deface the
said piece of literature is a Student
Control violation. This is odd since

Varsity Ballplayers
Capture Two Games

BY PALMER TRICE

The crucial period for the W&L
team has begun. For openers, the
Generals dropped a heartbreaking
76-53 loss to the Middies, at An-
naipolis. Playing perhaps their poor-
est game of the season, the Blue
looked bush. Further comment
would be repetitious, The most en-
joyable part of the contest was pro-
vided by WNVR. Unfortunately,
‘technical difficulties prevented our
own station from broadoasting the
ball game.

However, amid the din of Dore-
mus, the Generals stormed back

over the weekend. Friday night they
took on St. Pauls College. St. Pauls,
in spite of the fiact that they average
close to 100 points a game, walked
onto the court winless. The Generals’
forte, “the Big D” (defense), led
them to a 74-68 decision over the
visitors. This was quite a feat, es-
pecially in light of the Navy game.

Coach Verne Canfield expetced
Bryant College to be one of the
toughest battles to date. Showing a
new team pride, the boys put it all
together for a 77-72 victory. Bruce
King, starting his second ball gam:
in’ a row, tossed in 12 points and

grabbed 12 rebounds. His perfor-
mances have earned him another
starting role. Bruce, my choice for
player of the week, averaged double
figures both in rebounds and in
points. Hatton Smith played his fin-
est ball game to date, garnering 18
points and five assists.

Against Bryant, Captain Mike
Daniel returned to excellence, as he
shot a remarkable 60%, and wound
up with 25 points. This game mark-
ed the high point of the Generals’
season.

Over the last five years the Gen-
erals are 52-7 at Doremus .This
year’s record is 6-0. The question is,
“Qan the team win on the road?”
That should be answered this week,
as the Generals travel to Johns Hop-
kins and to Davis and Elkins. Vic-
tories here would break the “away
game” jinx.

At the present moment, the W&L
hoopers rank 15th in the nation on
defense . . . . Hopefully, ‘he Gen-
erals have found their best five. The
starting line-up will include Dave
Stone, Hatton Smith, Bruce King,
Paul McLure, and Mike Daniel.
... Bruce King will give Paul Mc-
Lure some needed help on_ the
boards. Maybe he will turn out to be
the key to the explosion of the W&L
offense? Hope it is, but some of us
are waiting for Charlie Strain to
blow up for about 25 points. We're
behind you Charlie.

“But who, disguished as Jim O’-
Brien, mikd«mannered _place-kicker
for the Baltimore Colts.”

So could go the spiel for the
young University of Cincinnati alum-
nus as he makes the banquet rounds
this year as the man who upstaged
The Man, Johnny Unitas. Whether
you liked the game as a whole 0%
not, the latter probably being the
case, you've got to admit it was ex-
citing in the end.

For Tom Landry and the Dallas
Cowboys, it will be another anguish-
ing six or seven months. The Texans.
although far from sharp, appeared
to be the better of the two elevens
for fifty-nine minutes. Then, Fate,
which can no longer be associated
with Chance where the Cowboys are
concenned, made its inevitable ap-
pearance.

Craig Morton, reverting to stand
ard form, fired an interception to
Mike Curtis, who carried the bal!
imto field goal range, then O'brien
kicked the winning three-pointer and
stepped into the pages of history.

For the most part, the game was
a model of buffoonery. Neither tc 4m
looked like a conference champion,
and I kept expecting Curt Gowdy to
announce that the real Super Bow!
would be played next week. The

Captain Mike Daniel drives hard for basket in 74-68 General victory over St. Pauls.

 

 

Dallas pass rush was formidable and
effective, harrassing Unitas and Earl
Morrall all day. Unitas was parti-
oularly bother, incurring a hairline
rib fracture as the result of a crush-
ing George Andrie tackle .

At the same time, however, the
Cowboy offense was less than spec-
tacular, and when you take away
part of its running game as the Colts
did, it became downright sme!'y.
Dwice the Colts held off Dallas
drives which ended in field goals.
Morton, even though looking better
than usual, was bad. No matter how
hard Baltimore tired to give it away,
the Cowboys wouldn't accept ii.

The Baltimores looked extremely
weak the first half, as Unitas com-
pleted only one pass in the first
quarter. Then after that graceful 76
yard touchdown pass, the Colt line
decided that the game woull be
much more exciting at 6-6 than at
7-6, so it allowed O'Brien's PAT to
be booked.

At other times, the two teams ap-
proached top-raie calibre. Dallas
executed the flare pass to Duane
Thomas for its only TD quite well.
And the Colts never quit trying m an
effort which ultimately yielded vic-
tory and $15,000 per man. With

It would be an injustice for a
Baltimore fan to ignore Super Sun-
day even though by now thousands
of words have passed through th:
media to the bleary-eyed spectator.
I too have something to say.

Moot commentiaries have reflected
on a “Stupor Bowl” in which two in-
ept teams fought a ridiculous fiasco
labelled football game. In the Wash-
ington Post, Shirley Povich wrote
in a most demeaning manner of both
teams as if they had come straight
from the sandlots. Liitthe note was
taken of the past season and remark-
able records boasted, and after the
trophy was awarded, the twenty-
eight games before were forgotten
for one game in which something
spectacular had to occur. I take as
reference the four other Super
Bowl Games, each of which had
lopsided scores and none of which
was a super game. Then Balltimore
(a once NFL power) meets Dallas
and the game is terribly close, ter-
ribly tense, and truly not an exhibi-
tion of what the average viewer
knows of football.

And we were wanned of what was
to come. The great Johnny Unitas
seemed overly cautious when he

By the way, Baltimore now stands

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

BY MONTY COTTIER

Tynanny, barbarians, — political
schemers abound in this film version
of the Broadway success, “The Lion
In Winter,” which begins today at
the Lyric.

It was in this film, as Eleanor of
Aquitaine, that Katharine Hepburn
won her third Oscar as Best Actress.
Peter O'Toole, playing opposite het
as Henry Il, was nominated for the

Best Actor award, as well, thus in-
suring that at least a modicum of
talent participated in the film’s crea-
tion.

The Machiavellian plots, subp ‘ots,
and plot twists provide admirable
foils for the thespian talents of the
featured players, although the m:vie-
goer who feels that good acting is a
thing self-sufficient unto itself, and
that nasty jolts for the sake of nasty
jolts do not a great movie mane, is
in for another session of mixed fee!
ings as he watches touches like Ric-
hard the Lion Hearted being present-
ed as a pervert, King (then Prince)
John chasing after his father’s mis-
tress, and so on.

All stylistic cavilling aside, hovw-
ever, it is interesting to note just
how much of a “Katherine Hepburn
flick” this is. Obviously, O'Toole is
nowhere near the competition whicn
her old friend Spencer Tracy was,
and one is struck by how mantully,
yet how ineffectually, O'Toole strug
gle to keep Miss Hepburn from
“stealing everything bul the cam-
eras,” as the old saying goes. This

fact, they are almost too credible.
One has the impression that the plo:-
ting and intrigue continue well after
the director's “Cut!”

For those interested in social
commentary, “Lion” has its serious
side, as well. When Eleanor says that
there, in the year 1183, she can see
the darkness and the bright eyes in
the jungle that is their lives, one can
almost see the darkness and bright,
animal eyes in our lives as well,

On Muddy Reviewing
(Continued from Page 2)

ithe existence of “sick” revolution-
aries is nonsense. Throughout his.
tory there have been revolutionaries
from societies as divergent as the
world is wide. Also, I would like to
call Mr. Olson's attention to the fact
that simply because a revolutionary
surfaces in the middle of society
does not mean that the existing soc-
iety created him any more than soc-
iety can Claim to create the genius.

To accept the idea that society is
responsible for the existence of the
“sick” revolutionary requires that we
form a concept of something inher-
ently wrong with society. Further-
more, acceptance of that concept
would force us to regard the revoiu-
tionary as being one of a very few
truly perceptive people. And the om-
pirical facts of history simply refuse
to bear us out in that idea. A more
likely hypothesis to exphain the exis-
tence of revolutionaries would be
that they arise out of a regrettable
combination of incidents and order-
ing of events in their lives which
mold them into the type of person
Dr. Toole desoribed.

Mr. Olson proceeds to present the
episode between Dr. Toole and the
student in the balcony as “a perfect
example of why we have “sick” rev-
olutionaries.” Mr. Olson fails to
note that Dr. Toole twice tried to
answer before he was allowed to
speak, that his “sluffing it off was
a reaction to the student's badgering
(not cries for reform), and that Dr.
Toole had already spoken of an un-
fortunate breakdown in communica-
tion making it nearly impossible io
rap with the revolutionary, This
tendency could be described as “tun-
ing out” or “deaf ears,” a tendency
exhibited by the young man in his

comments from the balcony sum-
ming up all of Dr. Toole’s com-
ments as “bullshit” with his hat still
on.
This is further manifested by the
fact the reforms the student sought
and those Dr. Toole backed were
really much the same. If not, there is
a real wainp somewhere.

Two more comments are in order,
arising out of but not directly irace-
able to Mr. Olson’s article and Dr.
Toole’s appearance. First, r:gard-
less of how liberal we are, we must
admit that not all, I repeat, not all of
the reforms sought by anyone ate
necessarily correct. The possibility
of error is great. | could propose,
and fight for, if I so desired, many
absurd reforms.

Secondly, change, that is, reform,
very often cannot be instanteneous.
As Dr. Hamilton pointed out Friday
night, it may take a long time, and
just beating a man physicaily or
forcing him to do as you demand
does not change his mind or, most
importantly, his attitude, In fact, by
really angering him you are likely to
reinforce his opinion, in mary cases.

On Missing Books
To the Editor of The Ringdum Phi:

Once again we find ourselves fac-
ing the age-old problem of how to
keep reference books from leaving
the confines of the library, or from
being secreted in such locations with-
in the library so as to insure their
use by only a few.

I don't mean to imply that refet-
ence books aren't continually “dis-
appearing;” anyone who even infre-
quently makes use of reference m-
terial eventually confronts this prob-
lem Rather, someone has officially
called a specific instance of missing
reference material to the attention
of the Student Library Committee in
the form of a complaint.

Consequently, last Wednesday, the
Committee met in closed session to
investigate the incident. Partial guilt
was established, and an individual
was duly fined. The committee, i1-
cidently, is empowered to levy fines
wpwards of $50.

This is only one incident. Unfor-
tunately, all too many incidents 50
completely unreported, leaving stu-
dents often for weeks without access
to assigned material.

If an individual removes refer-
ence material, and, for that matter,
any library material unlawfully, he
is not only subjected to a fine, but
also, if no intention to return the
material can be established, he may
be considered as a possible honor

At best, however, an individual
depriving his classmates of materials
by untawfully removing them is be-
ing extremely inconsiderate.

The Student Library Committee
has had this point driven home once

too often. Students and faculty, as
soon as they are aware of material
missing or suspect that someone may
be misusing material, are encourag-
ed immediately to notify members of
the committee or the library staff.

The Student Library Committee,
in turn, will attempt to do its part
to discourage would-be offenders,
and failing this, will deal with those
who would completely deprive oth-
ers for their own selfish gain.

Chairman, Student Library
Committee

In Baroody’s Defense

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

It comes as something of a sur-
prise to me, after five and a half
years at W&L and dozens of letters
to The Ring-tum Phi that never got
outside my skull, to find that Messrs.
Tebo and McMillan have finally
driven me to sit down at the type-
writer. Certainly there is no point
to any further discussion of “Love
Story” as a piece of literature; as
W. H. Auden has said, it is a waste
of time to kill someone who is not
long for this world anyway.

In any case, Mr. Baroody (and 1)
are judging the book by literary
standards which its hordes of ad-
mirers are Obviously not prepared to
accapt—and why should they? Hav-
ing made our point once, there is
thus nothing for Baroody and me to
do but shut up.

But the “Love Story” phenomenon
is more disturbing to me than just
another lapse in popular taste. To
one who would have liked to believe
the claim of the present generation
of students that it was going to cur:
the afflictions of our poor old neuro-
tic country, it is disappointing to find

‘se students no better at recogniz
ing the symptoms of the disease than
their older brothers and sisters.

1 would like to suggest to Mr.
McMillan that just by looking
around him, he could find things
happening every day that would pro-
vide him with all the grief and happ’
ness he can use—and happening to
real live people at that. (Of course,
getting your emotional thrilis by
the TV dinner method is unquestion-
ably less trouble. In fact, falling off
a log takes a heroic effort compared
with reading “Love Story.”

So I say to everyone who thought
it was heartless of Mr. Baroody to
squash the pretty butterfly that if
you looked at the remains, you
would have seen that it was not a
butterfly at all but an assemblage of
transistors and printed circuits, cle
verly miniaturized and painted to
look like the real thing.

A note: I had intended to remain
strictly impersonal, but on rereading
Mr. Tebo’s letter I find it remare-
ably offensive in any number of
ways, and so | feel inclined to say a
word about it. On reflection, I find
that the word that best desoribes Mr.
Tebo's letter is “puerile.”
