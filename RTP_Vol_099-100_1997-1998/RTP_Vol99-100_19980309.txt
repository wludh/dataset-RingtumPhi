t Eating disorders
, lurk below surface

BY WILL HARDIE
NEWS EDITOR

nly ﬁve students turned up
to take part in the national
eating disorders screening

program on Wednesday Feb. 25.
University Counsellor Anne
McThenia believes that the poor re-
sponse belies the true extent of the
problem at Washington and Lee, and
is disappointed that so few took ad-
vantage of the opportunity.

On Feb. l7, all Washington and
Lee students had received an e-mail
saying that screening tests would be
available throughout the day on Feb.
25. The screening program, run by
the non-proﬁt National Mental Ill-
ness Screening Project, aimed to raise
awareness of eating disorders.

None of the students who were
screened were at risk. “For them it

- served as an educational tool,” said

McThenia. “They came because
they had concerns and wanted to
validate them.”’

According to the National Insti-
tute of Mental Health, more than ﬁve
million women in the United States
suffer from eating disorders. Bulimia
is the most common, afﬂicting be-
tween 2 and 3 percent of young
women. About 1 percent of young
women are anorexic, and about 2 per-
cent of the general population have
binge eating disorder, which is un-
usual as it affects men to the same
degree as women.

“We know there are a large num-
ber of people with eating disorders,”
said McThenia. “The question is how

‘i to reach them.”

She believes that about 5 percent
of college-age women have an eat-
ing disorder. “Knowing that that ﬁve
percent are out there makes us want
to reach a wider audience,” she said.

The university health services
considered mandating at—risk stu-
dents, such as athletes, or even all

It freshmen, to be screened for eat-

ing disorders. The idea had to be
abandoned, because it was thought
too intrusive.

But Jan Hathom, women’s soccer

and lacrosse coach, said she would
support such a program. She has seen
three cases of eating disorders among
athletes in the last six years.

“I recognize that it will feel rather
intrusive to the ladies. They are not
going to like it, but it’s not going to
hurt either. It is the most likely way
to deal with this issue.”

04 Because of the secretive nature of
eating disorders it is diﬂicult to gauge
the extent of the problem at W&L.
But there are several reasons to be-
lieve that the incidence here may be
higher than the national average.

Psychiatrists believe that eating
disorders are associated with certain
personality traits, such as perfection-

ism‘and ambition, and with higher
socio-economic class.

“W&L draws people that ﬁt the
proﬁle,” said McThenia. “And the
pressures at this institution make
them doubly vulnerable.” She said
that danger factors at W&L include
the high pressure to succeed, the high
expectation to look a certain way, the
the low level of intolerance of dif-
ference.

“People who are at W&L want to
go into professions that seem to em-
phasize appearance more than the
wider ﬁeld, I think irresponsibly,”
she said.

Another factor might be the rela-
tively recent arrival of women as a
group at W&L. “Those women who
ﬁrst came here knew that they were
under great pressure to succeed aca-
demically and socially,” said
McThenia. That pressure might have
been passed down through succes-
sive generations of students.

Dr, Jane Horton, Director of
Health Services, agrees that this may
be a factor. “They are very much visi-
tors in a male social environment,"
she said.

The building of sorority housing
might shift the social balance in fa-
vor of women. But, Horton said, “So-
rority houses are by their nature not
the sort of places where these big
parties happen. The question is, can
they create a different social environ-
ment that is healthier?”

Health Educator Jan Kaufman
said her task is “getting people to
accept their body images, to learn to
feel comfortable with themselves.”
McThenia said that the atmosphere
at W&L does not help them to do
that. “This would work better in this
environment if it were tolerant of dif-
ference of every kind,” she said.

Kaufman has come across a vari-
ety of disrupted eating patterns
among women at W&L, including
what she calls the “bagel diet,”
whereby a student eats nothing but
bagels, and the “popcom and diet
soda” diet.

Eating disorders are particularly
difﬁcult to treat at college age be-
cause the attitudes that underlie them
developed as early as fourth or ﬁfth
grade or in high school.

“The difﬁculty is that it’s a whole
societal problem,” said McThenia.
According to a 1992 study, half of
9-year-olds and 80 percent of 10-
year-olds have already dieted. 40
percent of American women are on
a diet, though half of those are not
overweight. Kaufman blamed the
cultural and media emphasis on thin-
ness, as well as “the belief that look-
ing thin is a prerequisite for being

ill?) Controversy arises over
half price FD tickets

BY SEAN MCMANUS

 

TAFF WRITER
Serving side dishes and swiping cards
brought sonre Dining Hall workers more
than a free meal. Student workers received
half-priced Fancy Dress tickets, but not
without some controversy.

About I0 of the 28 D—Hall workers
took advantage of a compromise reached
between a disgruntled D-Hall worker and
the FD Committee. Knowledge of the dis-
count passed between workers through
word of mouth.

According to Carolyn Lee, FD Audi-

- tor, it had been customary in years past
for full—time, non-student Dining Hall staff
members to give away their ﬁee FD tick-
ets to students. This year the Committee
decided to begin stamping faculty and staff
tickets with the label “For faculty and staﬂf
only.” This made the tickets non-t1ansfer-
able, a decision which angered many D-
Hall workers who had grown accustomed
to going to FD for free.

“We were losing thousands of dollars,”
said Lee. She said the $25 tickets were for
this year only. The workers received no
discount on memorabilia. Since FD is
frmded exclusively through ticket sales,
Lee was looking for a “fair” way to tighten
the budget without raising ticket prices or
slashing the decorations budget.

Last Monday, Omar Vannoy, student
manager for the D—Hall, alerted the Ex-
ecutive Committee to the D—Hall work-
ers’ concems, accordingto Chris Baldwin,
vice-president of the EC. He noted that
given the context of fratemities at W&L,

‘Lord knows, Anything Goes’:

Fancy Dress a crowd pleaser

“people come to rely on certain things
from year to year, and it’s hard when you
take those things away.”

Vannoy could not be reached
for comment.

Lee said a “certain D—Hall worker
threatened to strike” if the workers didn’t

Anything Goes. Especially on Fancy Dress weekend.
Friday night a majority of students at Washington and Lee,
some faculty and staff celebrated the 91st Annual Fancy

Dress Ball.

The theme was the “Roaring Twenties: Flappers, Flight,
and Jazz All Night.” The gym became the scene of gang-

sters, ﬁappers and a speakeasy.

Senior Bill Wamock summed the weekend up when

he said,» “I had a hell ofa time.”

The overwhelming reaction to the ball was one of awe
and appreciation. Awe because of the decorations, and
appreciation because there was not a rap band for the
Thursday night concert. Junior Nathan Hager said, “Thank

God for a rock band Thursday night.”

From the standpoint of the Fancy Dress committee,
the ball was different from the past two years. Junior Mary-

Fourteen years after the first
women were permitted to attend

Q Washington and Lee, Beth Formidoni,

’96, ’99 Law, was elected the first fe-
male Executive Committee President.
She received 524 votes to junior James
HasIam’s 281.

Formidoni doesn’t believe that gen-
der elected her, but stated that it “was
about time.” “I was really glad that
gender didn’t impede my campaign in

a any way,” she said.

As a graduate and a second year
law student, Formidoni has noticed
some distinct changes at W&L.

“Women are more accepted at

‘V W&L now,” she said.

“This just doesn’t apply to my elec-
tion, but to Amy Gorham’s election
to Vice President two years ago. I
don’t think that would’ve happened

my freshmen year,” Formidoni said.

Haslam posted signs around carn-
pus plugging himself as the candidate
“Continuing 250 years of tradition.”
Haslam denies that the slogan had
anything to do with gender. “I didn’t
know how to interpret it,” Formidoni
said. “I have to assume the best and
assume that he meant it in an innocu-
ous way.”

Although some surveys say that
leadership differences do exist be-
tween men and women, Formidoni
believes that this will not have any
bearing on her ofﬁce.

“I think that gender may make a
more pronounced difference in a dif-
ferent context, like the President of the
United States,” she said. “Women are
usually less violent, and this would
make a difference when going to war.

Sommers Burger who was on the committee said the
decorations were “sophisticated” and was quick to point
out that many members of the Theatre Department
helped to build the set—like decorations. “It looked pro-
fessional. Not like a bunch of college—students with
some paint brushes,” she said.

Whether Greek or independent, students cel-
ebrated Fancy Dress in their own ways.

Burger, a Kappa Kappa Gamma, spent the week-
end at various parties in Red Square..

“It was a lot offun since all my friends were there.
Wejust hung out and had a good time and then went
to Lee-Hi,” freshman Betty Alkire said.

Fancy Dress tends to be W&L’s “80,000 dol-
lar answer to the prom,” but this year was a memo-
rable one. _

“They rolled out the red carpet for us,” Wamock
said. “New Orleans has Mardi Gras. W&L has F.D.”

receive free FD tickets. According to
Baldwin, the workers felt the non-trans-
ferable tickets were a surprise and there
wasn’t time to save for the cost of FD.
“... We reached a compromise in spite
of the threat not because of it,” Lee said.

According to Director of Dining Ser-
vices, Gerald Darrell. “No one ever came
to me about a strike,” Darrell said, “and
even if one student chose to walk out, he’d
be there by himself.”

Students who can’t afford to attend FD
can apply to be part of the committee
or to be a contract worker.

“We hope no one would be pre-
vented to coming [to FD] for ﬁnan-
cial reasons,” Lee said.

om Weatherly was once a frustrated student. He

knew a little about computers, but he sometimes
had bigger computer problems that only an experienced
person could solve. This is how Weatherly ﬁrst en-
countered the University Computing HelpDesk.

“From my own experience with the HelpDesk as a
client, [the HelpDesk attitude] made me, and possibly
others, feel that the client’s problem is not nearly as
important to the worker as it is to the student,” he said.

His concerns about Washington and Lee comput-
ing were shared bylifaculty and students all over cam-
pus. All that has changed, though, and Weatherly
knows it because he now works for the HelpDesk.

“They take enonnous amounts of pride in their work,”
he said. “It is this drive to solve problems and help that
has made our senior employees so knowledgeable.”
Now that he’s on the other side, Weatherly is becom-
ing knowledgeable, too, and he helps with the best of
them.

But the attitudes of most students have not changed.
What is the HelpDesk? Who works there? What does
it do? And most importantly, is it to blame for the com-
puter trouble that has students griping at 3 a.m.?

According to the HelpDesk website, any student
withr“a personable demeanor, some knowledge about
computers, and an interest in learning more” can apply
to work for the service. The HelpDesk stays open for
set hours (9-5 Monday through Friday, 7-10 on Sun-
day), and 22 students share those hours in shiﬁs. Each
student can work up to 10 hours each week, and most
students work 8-10 hours. When one works for the
HelpDesk, though, one becomes part of a power struc-
ture of which few students are aware.

The hierarchy is complicated enough to be mistaken
for a that of a European royal family: The workers are
broken up into four “teams,” and each team has a stu-
dent “team leader.” The teams are Operating Systems
(led by senior Doug Brown), Applications (led by
sophomore Justin Wagoner), Labs (led by senior Josh
Heslinga) and Hardware (led by junior Cliff Woolley).

Over all the students sits a grown-up supervisor,
Dirk van Assendelﬁ, who works in University Comput-
ing and is known as the Student Computing Coordina-
tor. The average student’s mind reels at the complexity,
but HelpDesk employees take it in stride, concentrat-
ing instead on getting the job done.

“We provide help to anyone who contacts us (stu-
dents, faculty, staff, etc.) on almost any computer-re-
lated topic, free of charge,” said Heslinga. “As far as I
know, there are no general kinds of problems that we
can’t solve.”

There are a few kinks in the system, though, since
the big switch of the campus computer systems this
year. For one thing, a few speciﬁc computer models
simply will not support the Novell log-in software that
runs in all the computer labs. But it is computers’ ten-
dency to crash that causes most resentment.

“Any time someone is working on a paper or some-
thing at 12 midnight or 1 a.m. and Jefferson crashes, that
person tends to be very disgruntled with University Com-
puting,” said Woolley. “When the same happens to the
same person more than once, that person starts to feel

Washington and Lee Christians have a web resource
they may not know about.

The Carpenter’s Workbench, a set of pages on the W&L
web site, provides Christian resources for anyone through
links, information and pages tailored to the W&L student

4 community.

Junior John Wilbers started the pages when he was a
freshman at W&L. ‘‘I wanted to increase communication

_ between the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, the Inter Var-

sity Christian Fellowship, and local churches,” hesaid, ‘There
" 3 were very few W&L organizations with web pages then.”

Though the W&L web site grew around it, the
Carpenter’s Workbench, so named because Jesus (a car-
penter) works through the groups on the page, remained a
steadfast resource for Christian surfers. The site has had

ll about 2,000 hits since it ﬁrst went up, a number that sur-
prised Wilbers.

“it’s a much bigger turnout than I expected,” he said.
He said that most of the page’s viewers are not current

4 W&L students. Rather, they are prospective students and
their parents, Christian people who are curious about the
religious life on campus. The prospectives and their fami-
lies are always glad to see the pages, Wilbers said.

“I get a lot of e-mail,” he said of the positive feedback

’4 he receives on the page. “I get a few every couple of

weeks, but it adds up.”

Freshman Lee Anne Applegate used the page as a re-
source when she was considering attending W&L. The
page gave her some idea of the Christian groups on cam-
pus, and she was able to contact involved students di-
rectly through the page.

“It’s nice to have somewhere to ﬁnd W&L students to
get in contact with,” she said. “It made it much easier.”
4 Wilbers and a handful of others keep the page up and

running with their programming skills. University Regis-

trar Scott Dittman provides some guidance for the page.

As site administrator as Wilbers is the one who answers J

the mail and makes the big decisions. For now, his next

V major project is the new Carpenter’s Workbench.

The new page will feature the same resources as the old
one, but it will do it with more style. A draft of the new
page is already up, and curious people can view it from the
old page. Wilbers predicts that the new page will be up by
mid-March and ready to help Christian surfers everywhere.

“I want to continually improve this page,” he said.

Wilbers won’t be around forever, though, and after he
graduates next year, someone else will have to be the ad-
it ministrator. Wilbers hopes that a responsible freshman or

sophomore will step in for thejob so that turnover is mini-
mized. The page needs a trustworthy leader because its
popularity continues to grow.

With the plans for expansion and the existing popular-
ity, the Carpenter’s Workbench is set to become a key-Chris-
tian resource for surfers everywhere. But Wilbers never
forgets the true meaning behind the page.

of students coming in, broken laptops cradled in their
arms. A few minutes later, those same students would
be smiling and thanking the staff for their help as they
left. The creation of the Labs team (a new group this
year) means that some members of the staff are respon-
sible for running around to the campus labs and making
sure the printer paper is stocked, the computers in gen-
eral are working, and the users are happy. Overall, com-
plaints about the campus computer service have
dropped since the initial problems ofthe system switch
at the beginning offall term.

Do the employees like their jobs? Despite the fact
that they, too, have overheard the muttered, negative
comments about the HelpDesk, they generally enjoy
what they do.

‘‘I’m pretty new to the
HelpDesk,” said freshman
Robert Marmorstein, “but
it’s a wonderﬁiljob and very
challenging.”

Heslinga has worked at
the HelpDesk since the be-
ginning offall term, and he
said he has beneﬁtted from
the experience.

“I think l’ve learned a lot
about computers during my
time on the staff,” he said.
“Sometimes it’s frustrating when a particular problem

more complex than it seems on the surface. It gets even
better; maintaining the ten or ﬁfteen servers around cam-
pus is a 24-hour-a-day job, but employees do it for the
sake of the 2,000 to 2,500 people who use the campus com-
puters and services.

What about individual computer problems that students
may have? The HelpDesk works for them, too. Any mem-
ber of the student body, faculty or staff can bring in a
computer and have it examined. If the computer owner signs
a waiver, the HelpDesk workers will do their best to ﬁx the
machine. Some things have changed about the service in
the past year, though.

“Our policy does now include ‘no house calls, said
sophomore Steven Klotz. He addresses complaints about
this change by saying that
fewer house calls means a 
more efﬁcient and helpful
HelpDesk, which all mem-
bers of the W&L community
can appreciate.

The HelpDesk is not re-
sponsible for the error of the
computer owners, either.
“We may not be able to help
students that do not follow
the guidelines we provide,”
Heslinga cautioned.

Still, the staff does every-

They say that baseball is the
game of inches, but the Washing-
ton & Lee men’s lacrosse team might
argue that statement after yesterday
aftemoon’s heartbreaking 12-11 loss
to Cortland State.

The Generals suffered an early sea-
son blow to their NCAA tournament
hopes when a last—second shot, which
would have tied the game for the Gen-
erals, bounced off the crossbar.

The game was played on the Uni-
versity of Virginia’s artiﬁcial turf ﬁeld
in Charlottesville due to the poor
conditions of a rain-soaked Wilson
Field. The 17th ranked Red Drag-
ons improved to 1-0 while the loss
dropped ninth ranked W&L to 3-1.

“It was obviously a tough loss,”
said freshman Pope Hackney, who
led the Generals with three goals.
“We lost to a team that we thought
we were better than.”

Cortland State took control early on
and extended their lead to 8-5 midway
through the third quarter before the
Generals came roaring back and scored
three staight goals to tie the game 8-8

going into the ﬁnal quarter.

In the fourth quarter, the Drag-
ons scored three straight goals of
their own after freshman Chris Dailey
found the back of the net and ex-

tendedthe Cortland_State lead to 1 1-
8 with 6:30 left in regulation. W&L
freshman Pope Hackney cut the
lead to 11-10, scoring two goals in
less than a minute but Cortland
State freshman Jim Cianfracca
scored his fourth goal of the game
to give the Dragons at 12-10 lead.

W&L once again rallied and
trimmed the lead back to one after
freshman attacker Matt Dugan made
it a 12-1 1 game. In the final minute of
the game, W&L had two golden
chances to send the game into over-
time, but Cortland goalie George
Breers came up with a huge save be-
fore the Generals’ ﬁnal shot hit the
crossbar with one second to play.
Breers came up big for the Dragon and
had 16 saves as Cortland outshot the
Generals 50-25.

and classmate Dugan added two

taking advantage of extra-man
oppurtunities — only going one for
seven in those situations.

“There’s a long way to go,” said
Hackney. “ It will be interesting to see
how we respond from this setback.”

Senior captain Chip Thompson
is disappointed with the team’s per-
formance so far this season.

“The team as a whole, during that
game, and so far this season, is not
displaying the level of intensity that
we should,” he said. “We still have
three quarters of a season left, and
if we start displaying that intensity,
we’ll put a good run on.”

ell, folks, it’s about two weeks until the Os-

Wcars (you can watch them on ABC March
23 — please, no wagering), and l’ll tell you
the winners now: Best Supporting Actor will be Burt
Reynolds for “Boogie Nights,” Supporting Actress will
be Gloria Stuart for “Titanic,” Best Actor will be Robert
Duvall for “The Apostle,” Actress will be Helen Hunt
for “As Good As It Gets,” Best Director will be James
Cameron for “Titanic,” Best Original Screenplay will be
Ben Affleck and Matt Damon for “Good Will Hunting,”
Best Adapted Screenplay will be Brian Helgeland and
Curtis Hanson for “LA. Confidential,” and Best Pic-
ture will be “Titanic.” I’m a 100 percent certain, too.
This year’s handicapping was way too easy.

Just because they’re going to win, ofcourse, doesn’t
mean they deserve to. I have my own personal list of
what was the best on screen this year, and it’s more
than a little different.

In the category of Best Supporting Actor, I chose
Samuel L. Jackson for “Jackie Brown.” He has won
several film festival awards for Best Actor for his role
as gun—runner Ordell Robbie, but I think that,just as he
really belonged in the Best Actor category for “Pulp

Fiction,” he really belongs in the Best Supporting Ac-

tor category for this one. Jackson’s portrayal of a man
on the verge of scoring big or going bust, constantly
checking out all the angles the best way he knows how,
blows all of the Oscar nominees out of the water (ex-
cept for Robert Forster, also from “Jackie Brown,” who
really belongs in the Best Actor category). My run-
ners-up are Robert De Niro for “Wag the Dog,” Robin
Williams for “Good Will Hunting,” Kevin Spacey for
“LA. Confidential,” and Matt Malloy for “In the Com-
pany of Men.”

For Best Supporting Actress, Gloria Stuart is the
overwhelming sentimental favorite. A former silent-
film star who makes a big impression in “Titanic,” she
is unbeatable, but there were many more notable per-
formances this year. My choice to win would be Alison
Elliott, who plays a serenely doomed heiress in Iain
Softley’s quite good “The Wings ofthe Dove.” Elliott,
who happens to.1ook a lot like Jodie Foster’s little sis-
ter, steals the show from putative star and undeserving
Best Actress nominee Helena Bonham Carter, who
couldn’t act her way out of a paper bag, but manages
not to ruin the ﬁlm. Other worthy performances, in
order: Minnie Driver for “Good Will Hunting,” Heather
Graham for “Boogie Nights,” Bridget Fonda for “Jackie
Brown,” and Christina Ricci for “The Ice Storm.”

Best Actor is atough call this year. There were more

than a dozen great performances that I saw. None,
however, topped Robert Duvall’s loud, raucous, con-
tradictory Holiness preacher in his film “The
Apostle.” This is the first time I have seen a reli-
gious character who isn’t either an unbelievable saint
or a blatant hypocrite. Sonny isn’t a perfect man,
but he loves God and believes in God, and, for him,
that’s everything. My runners-up are Sean Penn for
his sweetly lost maniac in “She’s So Lovely,” Chris-
topher Guest for “Waiting for Guffman,” Philip Baker
Hall for “Hard Eight,” and Peter Fonda for “Ulee’s
Gold.”
Best Actress
was a sparse
category this
year, almost as
sparse as Best
Actor was
crowded. Four
of the Oscar
nominees are
British, and so
they won’t win
over America’s
s w e e t h e a rt,
Helen Hunt.
The Academy
went out of its
way to ignore
some other great American performances, though.
My pick for Best Actress is Pam Grier for “Jackie
Brown.” She got a great part and showed she was
worth it. Not only beautiful and hard-boiled, Grier
can be tender, and vulnerable yet tough, and she
has a charm and sense of timing that light up the
screen. Her kiss with Robert Forster was a religious
experience. Runners-up are Stacy Edwards as the
deaf secretary in “In the Company of Men,” Robin
Wright Penn for “She’s So Lovely,” Julie Christie for
“Afterglow,” and Kim Basinger for “LA. Confiden-
tial,” who was nominated in the Supporting Actress
category but belongs here.

I don’t like to separate Best Director, Picture, and
Screenplay categories — I really don’t think they
can be judged separately — so let’s go ahead and
give them all to Quentin Tarantino and “Jackie
Brown.” The director’s third film is a gem ofa caper
with sex, drugs, soul music, and plenty of action and
humor. An incredible cast and attention to detail
make it worth watching more than twice. Robert
Forster’s Oscar-nominated performance is the come-
back of the year, if not the decade. The guy’s John
Wayne.

“Jackie Brown” was adapted from Elmore
Leonard’s “Rum Punch,” so that leaves Best Origi-
nal Screenplay unawarded. Woody Allen gets it for
“Deconstructing Harry,_” a Bergman-esque romp
through the travails of novelist Harry Block, which
delivers deep, solid, prolonged laughs, plenty of
wonderful eccentricity, and a cosmic message which
isn’t new, but is as true as it ever was.

Along with Bests come Worsts. My pick for

$1337

Worst Supporting Actor is Matthew McConnaughey
for his stunningly similar and dull work in “Contact”
and “Amistad.” Sure, he looks like the love child of
Paul Newman and Marlon Brando, but the promise
he showed in “A Time to Kill” has gone largely un-
fulfilled, at least so far. Worst Supporting Actress
honors go to Julia Louis-Dreyfus for “Father’s Day.”
I can’t figure out why she was there. Worst Actor
this year is Nicholas Cage for “Con Air.” It was not
a good movie and his corny hamming it up and lousy
Southern accent were some reasons why. Worst Ac-

tress goes to Kate Winslet for “Titanic.” I kept hop-
ing she would wake up, but she just sat there like a
lump on the screen, with a sort of dewy incompre-
hension on her face. Maybe it was the LSD some-
body slipped into the catered food (this really hap-
pened). Worst Director and Picture go to David
Cronenberg and “Crash.” There were a few interest-
ing things going on, but then there would be long,
boring, depressing love scenes which Cronenberg
complained critics didn’t recognize as actually con-
stituting the plot and action. So maybe Ijust didn’t
get it. But I think I did, and I think it bit. Other
notable flops: “Dead Men Can’t Dance” (don’t ask
why I watched that), “Con Air,” “Gentlemen Don’t
Eat Poets” (a.k.a. “Grave Indiscretion”), and the
abominable “One Eight Seven.” “Amistad” has to
take a hit in this category, too. It’s the worst ﬁlm to
which, I gave a thumbs-up this year. For some rea-
son, Steven Spielberg decided not to translate what
the captive slaves, the heroes of the film, have to
say at what seem like vital moments in the film. An
otherwise quite passable ﬁlm becomes an exercise
in frustration as we understand less and less well
the motivations and feelings ofthe main characters.
It’s an inexplicable and unforgivable mistake in judg-
ment on Spielberg’s part.

The unfairly pummeled of I997: the actually quite
good “The Devil’s Own,” “Air Force One,” “Abso-
lute Power,” “Nothing to Lose,” “Speed 2: Cruise Con-
trol,” “Fierce Creatures,” “The Lost World: Jurassic
Park,” “Air Bud,” “Picture Perfect” and “Steel.” Give
‘em a try sometime. I’m not saying they’re masterpieces,
but they’re better than “Amistad.”
