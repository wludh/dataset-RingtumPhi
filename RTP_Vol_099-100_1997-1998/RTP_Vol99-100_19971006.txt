The Ring-tum Phi recalls the past 120 years of Homecoming
traditions and keeps W&L up to speed on the upcoming
festivities. From our glory days of football to the fizzling

out of traditions in the 1960s to the new tradition
of banners in the D-hall, Homecoming has survived.

(Qp Two freshmen were

caught kissing under
a desk in the dark,
despite regulations
prohibiting cadets
from dating while
on the rat line.

BY HEATHER MCDONALD
STAFF WRITER

 

The inevitable happened at Vir-
ginia Military Institute last week.
A male rat and a female rat were

(1 caught kissing Saturday Sept. 20, an

act that is explicitly forbidden.
Sometime that night, a member of
the guard team walked into the rat’s
room to perform a routine room
‘check. Finding the room dark, he
turned the lights on and found the
two kissing under a desk. The two
offenders were immediately placed
on report; their actions were re-
ported to the Executive Committee.

The Executive Committee handed
down their decision and possible pen-
alty Oct. 2. Both cadets were placed

_ on four weeks of conﬁnement, and

were each given 30 penalty tours.
Penalty tours are 50-minute marches
from one end of barracks to the other.
These situations were considered
when VMI went co-ed, Director of
Public Relations Col. Michael
Strickler said. »
“Visitation with the lights out is

. prohibited,” said Strickler. “This was

added to the rule book this year be-
fore the female cadets arrived.”

Strickler describes the incident
as “not a big deal,” but says the
cadets must receive the appropri-
ate punishment.

“With the military system and
structure of VMI, we must be care-
ful. The message had to be sent be-
cause of the close conﬁnes that we
are in,” Stickler said. “It is simply a
part of military discipline, like the
training of troops. We do not con-
done this kind of behavior because of
the intimacy of barracks. It is even
closer here there; can be one room
with three to four guys and next to
them are three to four girls.”

The incident does not come as sur-
prise to most people at VMI.

“You have men and women, boys
and girls. You aren’t going to keep
that from happening,” said Strickler.

“It’s human nature, andl expected
something like this to happen,” a VMI
junior said. “But I do think that we
need to stop things like this before

they get out of control.” . . . . ,

Letting things like kissing on the
rat line get out of control increases
the risk of sexual harassment, the
cadet said.

“If sexual behavior is not curbed, it
might get to the point where if you look
at a person the wrong way, or give them
a friendly pat on the back, it could be
construed as sexual harassment.”

Cadets are forbidden to date
each other while on the rat line.
After the rat line, male and female
cadets can date each other, just as
long as their partner is not in the‘
same company.

ire gutted the country cabin

of Assistant English Profes-

sor Edward Adams last
Sunday.

By the time the three ﬁre crews
brought the blaze under control, the
house and all of Adams’ posses-
sions had been destroyed. Adams
was unavailable for comment.

The ﬁre broke out early Sunday
afternoon at the four-apartment
wooden country cabin, about 10 miles
north of Lexington The emergency
services were called at 1:24 p.m. The
Kerrs Creek ﬁre truck arrived within
two minutes, followed by Lexington
andBuenaVistaﬁre crewsandthe
Lexington Rescue Squad

Kerrs Creek Fire Department
Chief Southers said that by this
time “the ﬁre was well advanced.”
Flames had engulfed two of the
four apartments and were starting
to scorch through the back walls of
the other two.

Fireﬁghters entered the house
and attacked the blaze through
the two unaffected apartments.
They brought the ﬂames under
control within half an hour, but
damping down and clearing up
took until 7:45 p.m.

Luckily, none of the inhabitants
were home, but two ﬁreﬁghters
were taken to the hospital and were
treated for smoke inhalation and
chest pains related to exhaustion.
Neither was kept overnight.

Southers said the ﬁre took hold
fast and was hard to ﬁght because
the building was wooden.

Authorities believe the fire
started accidentally but have no
clues as to the precise cause.

PiKA won’t appeal ruling

BY ERIC SWENSEN

and Lee community.

STAFF WRITER

i Kappa Alpha has decided for now not to appeal
the social probation handed down by the lnterfra-

ternity Council, choosing to correct its mistakes.

“We haven’t decided yet, but we probably won’t ap-
peal in the short term,” PiKA President Andrew Cuny said.
“We want to take positive steps and not repeat the mis-
takes we’ve made.”

PiKA was ﬁned $2,500 and placed on social probation

A for the remainder of fall term by the IFC last week for two

violations of the IFC’s alcohol policy.

The positive steps will include presenting new guidelines
to the IFC that will govern how PiKA’ 5 parties operate.

“We’re in the process of drawing up new guidelines
concerning alcohol, security and guest lists,” Curry said.
“We want to present the guidelines to the IFC to get their
input and help and make sure these guidelines comply with
IFC regulations.”

Also important, is educating the chapter members on
alcohol-awareness, Curry said. “We want to make sure
that everyone knows what their responsibilities are and
what the consequences are for failing to follow the rules.”

PiKA will schedule a mandatory speaker on alcohol
awareness for its chapter members and hopes to sponsor
an alcohol awareness speaker for the entire Washington

Curry is hopeful that the social probation won‘t have
an adverse effect on rush.

“It won’t help,” Cuny said. “But we’re not looking for
the kind of guy we’ve seen just once at a party and who’s
pretty cool when he’s been drinking.”

PiKA’s can still socialize with freshman when in
groups no larger than ﬁve brothers, Curry said. “Ac-
tually, the smaller groups might help us get to know
the freshmen better.”

While PiKA deals with the consequences of failing
to follow the new BYOB policy, many fraternity men
said they haven’t noticed much of a change under the
new regulations.

“Not much has changed,” junior Roy Burns said. “I
brought my own alcohol out to a party, and some girl asked
me, ‘Are you really following the BYOB polic_v?"’

“People aren’t more concerned about the welfare of
others,” sophomore K.D. Vo said. “They’re more con-
cerned about breaking IFC rules.”

Doug Peddle, a junior, doesn’t think the BYOB policy
has had much effect in curbing binge drinking.

“I think it’s interesting that more freshman have gone
to the inﬁrrnary this year than last,” Peddle said.

University Computing takes heat,
Students criticize new system

BY KATHRYN MAYURNIK
WT NEWS EDITOR

The new computing system at
-Washington and Lee came under ﬁre
in the last few weeks in a series of let-
ters on the newsgroup wlu. computing.

The controversy began with a letter
from senior Adam Avitable and four

words: “George Orwell wasright.”

“I don’t like logging on through

Netware and having every move I
make recorded in the history ﬁle,”
Avitable wrote. “It’s no one’s  busi-
ness. What’s next? A retina scanner
at the comer of the computer to verify
who the user is and a three hour a
week limit for checking e—mail?”
Avitable’s other gripes include the
“inconvience” of waiting for the com-
puter to restart each time a user logs

off and the “stingy” $20 per year print
subsidy. Avitable complained about
the disappearance of the dot matrix
printers, which were always free.
Senior Jason Sorens responded to
Avitable’s letter, agreeing with most
of his points. “The new system

EC dishes it out:

39 organizations receive

BY JASON ZACHER
—":—"?" EXECUTIVE EDITOR

Forty-two campus organizations
begged and pleaded their cases over the
past two weeks to the Executive Com-
mittee in a desperate attempt to receive
funding. Thirty-nine were successful.

“We had about $450,000 worth of
requests,” said EC Vice-President
Chris Baldwin. “The only problem
was we only had about $330,000 to
give out. We had to shave more than
$100,000 off the requests.”

The club Ice Hockey team asked
for money for the ﬁrst time this year.
After being suspended last season

from the league, senior Dave Bruett
is trying to get the club started again.
The $1,885 they received is already
spent paying for ice time at the
Roanoke Civic Center, where the
league plays.

“We asked for $2,400 for fees, jer-
seys and pucks,” Bruett said. “I’m
happy, though we’ d like to have a little
more. We could have purchased the
jerseys and re-used them every year.”

Baldwin argued that the EC tries
to give the club sports the money they
need to ﬁeld a team, but with the in-
creasing number of clubs and organi-
zations striving for their piece of the

“cash

EC pie, the allocations become harder
each year.

Some organizations came out of
this year’s process unscathed.

Women in Technology and Sci-
ence, a recent addition to the W&L
campus, received every penny of the
$355 they asked for. W.I.T.S. Vice-
President Laura Goodwin was excited
to receive the money.

“We were really lucky,” Goodwin
said. “We think that we got it beacuse
we asked for a modest amount and we
itemized everything.”

difficult,” Sorens said.

Student Computing Coordinator Dirk van
Assendelft wrote a letter in response to Avitable’s
scathing comments. “On most new systems, the
reboot time is less than 30 seconds,” van Assendelft
said. “This seems to be a reasonable time to wait
to insure that your personal information on the net-
work is secure.” I

Looking for ways to minimize the reboot time
is an ongoing project, van Assendelft said.

In response to Avitable’s gripe about “every
move he makes” being recorded in the history file,
van Assendelft said, “We do not keep any history
files of your Netware activity.”

“As a matter of fact, it would be simpler for us
to record your every keystroke on Liberty than it
would be to monitor your Netware use.”

Executive Committee Vice President Chris
Baldwin wrote a letter in reponse to the crossfire.
“  I find the new system very frustrating to those
who are accustomed to liberty,” Baldwin said.
“I’m still uncertain as to what was so wrong with
Liberty  it accomplished all of my e-mail needs.

“I’m sure that there are a few students out there
who are adept enough to take advatage of the new
system’s perks. However, for the overwhelming
majority of returning upperclassmen, I don’t be-
lieve that they have any clue what these perks are
or how to take advantage of them.”

Van Assendelft also responded to B.aldwin’s let-
ter, stating that W&L was lagging behind similar
universities and was well behind the “real world”
last year, and the change was needed.

W.I.T.S. is an organization made
up of almost 30 W&L women who
bring in girls from the middle schools
to try to interest them in science. Their
program will run nine labs through-
out the year, and the money W.I.T.S.
received will be used for purchasing
items like glassware, lab coats and
even sharks and cow eyeballs for the
dissection lab.

According to Baldwin, the EC
uses four general criteria to determine
the allocation for each group. First,
an organization must show how they
are using the money, and second, how
much of the money has been spent in
the past. Though this is easy to de-
termine for some organizations, it is
difficult for those who generate their
own revenue.

All of the money the EC dis-
burses comes from the $155 each

student pays as the student activi-
ties fee. Because of this, the EC
examines the reach of the group as
the third criterium.

“We really try to see what a
group gives to the W&L commu-
nity and who their activities in-
clude,” Baldwin said.

The fourth criterium is the strengh
of the group. First-year organizations
and publications typically do not re-
ceive funding because, according to
Baldwin, the EC wants to make sure
the group will use the money.

In addition to the money dis-
bursed for organizations, the EC
keeps part of the money for their
operating expenses and it keeps a
reserve in the event of an open
honor trial.

The EC also keeps a portion of
the money set aside in case of emer-
gencies, and according to EC Trea-
surer Taylor Shultz, thelUniversity
requires the EC keep part of the
money set aside in case of trans-
fers or withdrawls.

Generals stretch
their ODAC

winning streak to
22 matches

BY KIEFH WIDNB2
STAFF WRHER
t was a milestone week for head
Ivolleyball coach Terri Dadio, who
collected her 100th victory in
Tuesday’s defeat of Randolph Macon
at the Warner Center. Dadio has com-
piled a 100-34 record in ﬁve seasons
at W&L. As well as guiding the Gen-
erals to their lone ODAC champion-
ship in 1995, the Generals currently
have a 22-consecutive-game regular-
season conference winning streak.
The Generals won their 21st on
Tuesday with a 15-4, 15-4, 15-5 win
over the Wildcats. The match fea-

tured the two most potent offensive -1

players in the conference, W&L
sophomore Nancy Reinhart, who
leads the ODAC with an average of
3.53 kills per game, and Randolph
Macon senior Ginger Raymond, who
is second in the ODAC with 3.45.
Raymond won the statistical battle,
compiling 10 kills compared to
Reinhart’s nine, but lost the war. In
the ﬁrst game, a well played game
despite the lop-sided score, senior
Holly Thomsen started strong, scor-
ing a kill in the initial set and then
serving to make the score 2-0. After
trading points, Nancy Reinhart’s serv-
ing sparked another W&L run and a
5-1 score. Randolph Macon then ran
off two straight, but could do little
more as junior Megan Snodgrass, se-
nior Hilary Martin and Thomsen
served to make the score 14-4. After
several sideouts for both sides,
Reinhart ﬁnished the game off with
an unreturnable serve.

In the ﬁnal two games, Randolph
Macon could not muster much resis-
tance to the W&L attack. After the
teams fought to a 1-1 tie in the sec-
ond game, Reinhart served three
straight to make it 4-1. After a ser-
vice point by freshman Mary Beth
Brookby made it 5-1, senior Ali
Beard, who had 21 assists for the
match and is currently sixth in the
ODAC for assists per game, ran off
ﬁve straight serves to blow the game
open. The Generals subsequently
cruised to a 15-4 victory, with sopho-

more Megan Macy earning the kill on
the ﬁnal point. In game three, the
Generals, behind four kills from
Reinhart and two kills from freshman
Melissa Williams, again had little
trouble against the Wildcats.
Snodgrass did most of the service
work and earned akill on the last point
as the Generals closed the match 15-5.

On Thursday, the Generals trav-
eled to Bridgewater, the defending
ODAC champions and the last con-
ference team to defeat W&L in regu-
lar season play, albeit in 1995.
Bridgewater, ranked 4th in the con-
ference in the preseason, gave the
Generals all they could handle. After
losing the ﬁrst two games 12-15, 12-
15, the experienced players on the
W&L roster stepped up and refused
to let their winning streak vanish.

Reinhart had a season-high 19 kills,
14 of which came in the pivotal games
three and four, when the Generals
faced elimination. Ali Beard had a
season-high 42 assists and a career-
high 23 digs. Thomsen had three ser-

Snodgrass had four of her seven kills
in game four. The ﬁnal score was a
General’s victory 12-15, 12-15, 15-
9, 15-6, 15-10. This is the second
straight year that the Generals have
come back from a two-game deﬁcit
against Bridgewater. With the win,
the W&L improves to 9-4, 5-0 in the
ODAC, while Bridgewater falls to 8-

Generals remain winless heading int
Homecoming with 24-3 loss to RMC

BY BRENDAN HARRINGTON

The Generals continue to search

for their ﬁrst victory of the season,.

as they lost 24-3 on Saturday.to
Randolph-Macon College in
Ashland. '

Two touchdown passes from
Randolph- Macon quarterback
Sidney Chappell to wide receiver

Michael Becker led the Yellow:

Jackets to a decisive victory and
improved their record to 3-1 on the
season. The loss dropped Washing-
ton & Lee to 0-4 for the season and
0-2 in the ODAC. A

The Generals’ offense continued
to struggle as they picked up only
187 total yards compared to

Randolph-Macon’s 460 total yards.’
The only W&L points came on a 32’-

yard ﬁeld goal from senior Matt
Holbrook after senior Matt Luka
returned and interception 44 yards
to put the Generals deep into RMC
territory.

The Yellow Jackets got off to a
quick start as midway through the
ﬁrst quarter Sidney Chappell threw
a 72-yard touchdown strike to
Michael Becker to give Randolph-
Macon a 7-0 lead. The Yellow
Jackets would not strike again until
late in the second quarter when
tailback Michael Hurt dashed 13
yards for a Randolph Macon touch-
down. RMC also added a 22-yard
ﬁeld goal with 0:53 left in the ﬁrst
half to take a 17-0 lead into the
locker room.

The Generals pulled to within 14
after Ho1brook’s 32-yard field goal
following Luca’s interception re-
turn, but that would be as close as
the Generals would get. With 6:04
left in the game Randolph-Macon

put the Generals away after Becker
scored his second TD of the game
on a 5-yard pass from Chappell.
Becker finished the day with 114
yards on 4 receptions and a pair of
touchdowns while Chappel ﬁnished
with 302 yards passing and 2 touch-
downs. The third piece of the Yel-
low Jackets balance scoring attack,
Michael Hurt, rushed for 96 yards
on 16 carries and he also scored a
touchdown.

For the Generals, tailback Seth
McKinley had his best game of the
season as he rushed for 73 yards on
15 carries. However, this was the
only bright spot for an otherwise
nonexistent Generals offense.
Quarterback Christian Batcheller
completed nine of twenty-five
passes for only 102 yards and 2 in-
terceptions.

The Generals continue to miss
the presence of junior WR Chas
Chastain who has missed the last
two games with a knee injury and
whose return for the remainder of
the season is doubtful.

The Generals’ olfense could only
muster up 10 ﬁrst downs on Satur-
day compared to 23 for Randolph-
Macon. The Yellow Jackets also
dominated time of possession; they
held the ball nearly twice as long as
the Generals.

The Generals will try to regroup
for next week as they face Davidson
College for homecoming. The Gen-
erals hope for a little extra inspira-
tion in front of a homecoming
crowd as they will attempt to make
it into the win column for the ﬁrst
time this season. Kickoff is at 2p.m.
at Wilson Field.

Generals set new W&L winning streak record
with most recent victories

BY FRANCES GROBERG
j"“————'*“' STAFF WRHER
At the outset of the season, Coach
Jan Hathorn expressed her wish that
this year’s women’s soccer team re-
peat some of the accomplishments of
last year’s squad. This season, the
Generals have not only matched their
feats of 1996, but surpassed them.
With their two wins in the past
week against Sweet Briar and South-
west Texas, the Generals set a new
school record for most consecutive
wins to start a season with their im-
pressive 8-0 start. “Down the line, we
hope to be the ODAC champions,”
said junior co-captain Karin Treese.
“Collectively, the team believes that
we can do it, especially this year.”
Sunday’s game against Southwest
Texas proved to be the most difficult
for the team thus far. The score re-
mained 0-0 throughout the ﬁrst half
and most of the second half, until
Treese scored off of a deﬂected cor-
ner kick with 3 :09 left in the game to
give the team a 1-0 victory. Treese,
who is W&L’s all-time leading scorer,
has 13 goals on the season and has
scored seven out of the eight game-

, Thursday’s game against Sweet
Briar proved not so taxing for the
Generals, and they cruised to a 4-0
victory. Before the game, Treese ex-
pressed her feeling that this would be
an important game for the team, and
that a win was crucial.

Evidently, she didn’t have much
to worry about, as she put the team
ahead midway through the ﬁrst half
off a cross from Margaret-Hunter
Turner. The score remained 1-0 until
the second half, when sophomore
Ginny Jemigan took a great pass from
junior Elizabeth Richey, blasting it

past Sweet Briar goalie Carol Skriloff.

The Generals also got goals from se-

nior captain Claire Bowers and fresh-

man Liz Olson in the ﬁnal ﬁve min-

utes to set the ﬁnal score at 4-0.

“Thursday’s game was good for us.

It was one of those games we needed

to win, and we all pulled together for

the victory,” said Treese.

The Generals will play at Roanoke
on Thursday, October 9, and will be
back at the Liberty Hall Field for their
game against Goucher on Saturday,

1925 —- The Bonfire

' "Get Virginia, Get Virginia,
Get Virginia "Friday evening,
1000 students, alumni and faculty
gathered for a pep rally. Bonfires
roared, the band played and
supporters’ yelled out.

The first speaker, Cy Young,
graduated in 1916 and earned 16
varsity letters during his time at
W&L and led the first of the
university’s truly dominating
teams — tems that are part of the
13 winning seasons from 1905-
1914. He traveled from Helena,
Ark., and continued to travel to
each of the Generals’ games
during the 1920s.

The second speaker, G.H.
Denny, a former W&L president
who had gone on to become
president of the University of
Alabama, which was was criticized
for stealing the W&L Swing and
calling it the Alabama Swing. .
Denny, still fond of W&L, told the
crowd, the alumni, “Strip the
Washington and Lee Campus of
every building and every dollar,
and are leﬁ some things more
precious than silver and gold.”

The Game

On a cold, wet Saturday,
thousands of people crowded
Wilson Field to watch the Generals
play University of Virginia. It was,
as the 1925 Alumni Magazine
announced: “The First Ofﬁcial
Annual Homecoming Day.”

Tickets were $2 and seats were
reserved. Students were advised
that extra seats were added at each
end of Wilson Field_— enough to
accommodate 10,000 people.
November was selected for the
annual game because it was the
most convenient time of the year‘ . ,
for alumni to return. Fraternity
House managers opened the
houses to visiting alumni. The
railroads offered special rates from

9 all over the state, tickets-for the

game were sold in Roanoke,
Lynchburg and Staunton. p
Local merchants were asked to

close their stores during the
afternoon so that everyone in town
could attend the game. It seemed
the whole state of Virginia turned
out for W&L’s first homecoming.

It was wet day, but the Generals
played well. As one reporter in the
Ring-tum Phi wrote:

“Sloshing around in the mud,
though, did not dampen the ardor
of either the Generals or their
enthusiastic supporters so that for
the third consecutive time Wash-
ington and Lee triumphed over her
traditional foe, the University of
Virginia.”

The final score was 12-0.

The Dance

They held the first after-football
dance that night. Southern Colle-
gians, the school’s orchestra,
provided the music. According to
the Phi, “A large crowd from
Virginia are expected to attend the
dance, and an equally large
number of girls.”

This dance, soon evolved into
an event called “Openings.” The
gymnasium would be lavishly
decorated and sometime during the
dance, the Homecoming Queen
would be crowned.

Big-time Football

Those were the early years, the
years traditions began. Between
1925 and the mid 1960s these
traditions and other traditions such
as Fraternity decorations, freshmen
parades, the 13 Club, pep rallies
continued.

For years at Homecoming the
Alumni Association awarded a
prize to the fraternity with the best
decorations. Fraternities decorated
their front lawns (if they had them)
orgtheir houses. They made
banners and carried them during
the Freshman Torchlight Parade.

The bonﬁre and pep rally
eventually expanded to include a
parade. The night before the game,
freshmen in their pajamas and

' other students gathered in the gym

for a‘pep rally. W&L’s (male)
cheerleaders would lead students
in cheers and speeches would be
givenby the coaches and players.

clad, would carry torches through
Lexington’s streets.

Another group of football
supporters, known as the 13 Club,
used Homecoming as a marker
for initiation. Thirteen days
before Homecoming, the 13
Club would begin its
initiation period of its 13
new pledges (who had
paid their initiation fee
of$l3.13) from 13
different fraternities. At
some point during these 13
days, it was usual for the statue of
Cyrus McConnack to be tarred and
feathered and the base covered
with little 13s.

The 1960s

The frivolity of these traditions
soon clashed with the serious state
of the country. Most of the
traditions died in the late 1960s
when 1.: Vietnam war was more
important than traditions.

But it was also a time of new
traditions, Keith Shillington,
professor of chemistry, began his
own. He crowned the Homecom-
ing queen and planted a big kiss on
her check at the football game. In
1990 he was unable to participate
because of a stroke, and he retired
the next year.

The last mention, in the Phi, of
a house winning a decorations
award was Lambda Chi in 1969.
The writer stated: “It seems that
for the most part, an alumnus
returning to campus is a lonely
experience.”

In 1970, Homecoming received
only passing attention in the Phi.
Besides noting its existence, the
article informed students of the
Friday night conceit, a tradition
continued today, and the Saturday
game.

After the game there was a
grain party in Red Square. Star-
tling when contrasted with the
1955 Homecoming issue of the
Phi. In which the E.C. stated its
policy on drinking in public would
be strictly enforced.

The class of 1925, had their
reunion that year.

1930

a
new
tradition
was born.
The
crowning of
the queen was

turned over the
student body. They in
turn created a spectacle of
skydivers and a sealed envelope.

In 1992, the Homecoming

- parade was restored. It looked a

little different: no torches, just
ﬂoats. But was its first appearance
in a quarter of a century.
Kathekon, the student-alumni
relations committee, is responsible
for reviving the Homecoming
parade.

The parade featured a variety of
participants. Non-W&L parade
members included fire depart-
ments, marching bands, and Mayor
Homer E. Derrick.

Alumni groups involved in the
event included the Five-Star
Generals, and the class of 1938
complete with the mysterious
Hotchkiss Llama. Various campus
organizations and every W&L
sorority and fraternity also
participated.

1997

This year marked the loss of the
traditional parade and the introduc-
tion of a new tradition — the
banner.

ﬁrst football season —

Washington and Lee’s football tradition began 124
years ago in a game against Virginia Military Insti-

‘ tute.

Not only was it the first meeting between the two
schools, it is recognized by many historians as the
ﬁrst college football game ever played in the South.
W&L’s first official season began in 1890. The sched-
ule expanded to include other southern schools and
annual games against VMI became a battle for brag-
ging rights.

In the early part of the century, the Generals expe-
rienced a golden era of football. The team had thir-
teen consecutive winning seasons from 1905 to 1917
and in 1914 picked up their first title by winning the
South Atlantic Championship. The team continued

 

the team lost 20-7 and finished the year ranked No. 18.

The glory days of W&L football ended in 1954.
Two players were caught turning in tests with exactly
the same responses. The Executive Committee began

as head coach. His excellent coaching skills tumed
the forgotten team into a powerhouse of football again.

The 1959 Generals turned in back-to-back im-
maculate seasons. The 1961 undefeated team was rec-

   

seasons or better seasons and was named the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference Coach of the Year in
1996.

The team has yet to win this season.

labor to build the time-consuming
ﬂoats. Although all four sororities
and two non-Greek floats sauntered
along Lexington’s streets, only two
fraternities entered. This lack of par-
ticipation sent a tacit message to the
Alumni Ofﬁce. The ﬂoats were not
a top priority with the students.

Assistant alumni director Frances
Smith, class of 1996, said “For a
Homecoming parade to be a success,
it needs to be student owned and re-
ally desired as something to rally
around. Students need to want to par-
ticipate, but as it was last year, it was
too much of a struggle trying to get
students involved.

As an alternative to the parade,
there will be a banner competition.
Kathekon will provide the Greek or-
ganizations and various
other clubs with most of
the necessary materials;
each group is encouraged
to decorate its banner in a
way which expresses its
individuality, and at the
same time, supports
Homecoming.

The banners will be
displayed in the Dinning

SING IT BABY “TheWashington and Lee Swing” has remained fer
80 years the most popular and most widely imitated ﬁght song in
. vl collegiate history. It is the ﬁrst victory song ever composed for a
university by its students.
A copy of it was carried into space on the Shuttle Columbia by
U.S. astronaut and W&L graduate, G. David Low. In 1958, Louis
¢ ‘Satchmo’ Armstrong played at a W&L Homecoming “and ended on
a screaming note with the ‘Washington and Lee Swing’,” according
to the Ring-tum Phi - 1958.

an event such as Hall.

Homecoming re-
quires. Preparations for Homecom-
ing are handled entirely by a three-
person staff in the alumni office,
with little student participation; plan-
ning begins in July’, and it entails
working with the Lexington Police
Department and other organizations
in the community.

Thus, “When the police depart-
ment wanted a guarantee of good

100 YEARS.

student participation, we (the alumni
planners) had to rethink whether the
parade would be in everyone’s best
interest,” said Smith.

Additionally, planners had no-
ticed that the annual Homecoming
parade was taking some of the ex-
citement away fonn the Mock Con-
vention parade.

“With a student body as small as
W&.L’s, there just wasn’t enough
support to justify having that many
parades,” added Smith. As a result,
it was decided to skip the parade this
year.

Next year, a 250'“ anniversary
parade is planned, and it will be run
solely by a student committee in an
effort to make the parade a student
activity ag"“n.

Most students seem to support he
planners’ decision. “I think not hav-
ing a parade is a good idea. The
ﬂoats were a waste of time and no
one went to the parade anyway,” said
Ryan Jancaitis, sophomore.

As for the future of this latest
twist on Homecoming, Smith says,
“The banners are an easy tradition
to continue because they do not take
100 percent participation, and yet
they can still be a success.”

the advance sale of tickets recorded in the graduate

manager’s ofﬁce. Mail orders for tickets have been

Extra seats have been added at each end of Wilson

over 10,000.

A petition will be made to the local merchants to the
effect that they close their stores so everyone may at-

.Road-cheese
Homecoming Queen?

'1 For over a decade now, the boys at Washington
and Lee (we’re not referring to the general male
population as “men” because that is a title that
boys must earn) have not had to go as far to find

5‘'girls for date functions  but wait! Despite the
adequate number of women right here on oompus,
our boys still hop in their sport-utility vehicles and
voyage over to Sweet Briar, Hollins and Mary

x\aBa1dwin to entice those girls (who aren’t lesbians)
to come to W&L for various parties, date func-
tions and, yes, even Homecoming.

L Although some W&L women dream of

‘someday being Homecoming Queen, their
ehanoes are limited because a number of the
fraternities in the past (only ONE fraternity, and
you know who you are, nominated “road cheese”
this year) have nominated “road cheese” for the
{W&L Homecoming Queen title. Let’s say that
’pne more time: W&L Homecoming Queen. This
is our school, and that means that one of our
women should be Queen. We do not refute the

' fact that some of the girls from the all-female
schools are attractive and nice, but guys, wake up!
Look around you. There are hundreds of attrac-
live, friendly, intelligent women right here at

4 }W&L. Or do intelligent women intimidate you?

; We also do not refute the fact that most of the
?‘road cheese,” since they lack the presence of I
:males at their schools, are more than willing to

4 pome to W&L frat parties, hook up and/or spend
:the weekend (we know of girls who claim to be
‘coming for a party, yet they have three-days’
:worth of luggage secured in the trunks of their

1 gears  how convenient!)

' Guys, don’t get us wrong; we don’t expect every

Eboy here to find the woman of his dreams here as well.

3But we would ask that you stop overlooking the incred-
gible females right under your noses (no, not literally 

‘-;that would be a Hollins girl) and ask some of us to
Ifunctions at our own school for a change. Many
iwonderful females are left dateless or must resort to
:,asking VMI cadets.

, i. If the tables were turned, and W&L was
surrounded by all-male schools, how would you
boys feel if you weren’t able to get a Homecom-
ing date? Take a walk in our shoes for a change

Girls, Girls, Girls
on Broadway

I have never met an expert on
erotic dancing, but at least twelve
Roanoke citizens have.

On Tuesday, jurors in the trial
of “art” establishment “Girls, Girls,
Girls” met Judith Hanna, a doctor
of anthropology and “expert on
erotic dancing,” according to The
Roanoke Times. Hanna testified

that stripping is an art form and that

 

the obscenity charges against the
club were unmerited.

In court, Hanna compared strip-
ping to ballet and argued that erotic
dancing requires artistic skill simi-
lar to what you would see at a circus.

I admit I was unaware that
circus performers have artistic
skill. I was also unaware that
erotic dancing is a possible
topic of research.

For Dr. Hanna it is; she has
spent 37 years researching dance,
apparently includingthe kind which
involves a runway, a pole and flash-
ing lights. Her work has taken her
to 23 striptease clubs across the
country. Her expertise has been
requested in numerous courtrooms,
according to The Roanoke Times.

The nature of Dr. Hanna’s work
raises a few questions.

First, how did she decide that
this was what she wanted to do
with herlife? Atayoungage,when
all the other little girls told their
kindergarten teachers that they
wanted to be doctors and lawyers,
didsherunaroundscreaming,“I’m

going to spend my life in strip barsl”
Is she following a pattern of behavior
which she learned from her father/
mother/sick Uncle Leroy?

Second is Dr. Hanna’s book, “To
Dance is Human: A Theory of Non-
verbal Communication,” only sold in
stores which also feature private view-
ing booths? Does it consist mostly of
pictures? Would other “scholars” fre-
quentsuchstoresinordertodo“research”?

Third, where would Dr. Hanna take
her friends? On Friday night, if she
turned to you and said, “I know about
this great little club across town, do
you want to go?” what would you say?

Dr. Hanna’s testimony from the
trial is even more interesting than her
line of work.

At the trial, Dr. Hanna argued that
the female body is of special interest
to many because we all come from the
female body, according to The
Roanoke Times. Men like strippers,
then, because they remind them of
their mothers. That would explain
why, among the cries of “Hot damn!”
and “Yeah, baby, yeahl”, men fre-
quently shout at strip clubs, “Hi, Mom,
I did well on my math test.”

Dr. Hanna also compared the strip-
ping at “Girls,Girls,Girls”toaBroad-
way production. If Broadway is any-
thing like a strip club, l’ll skip “Cats.”

Dr. Hanna’s 37 years of research
was not enough to convince the
Roanoke jury. “Girls, Girls, Girls”
was found guilty and fined the maxi-
mum possible punishment, despite Dr.
Hanna’s efforts.

The owner of the establishment has
vowed that the club will remain open,
however, and that the dancers will
keep dancing.

“Art” marches on.

Drinking not solely a
fraternity experience

“The answer, I think, is for colleges and
universities to do away with the selective cam-
pus fraternities and sororities that have bullied,
insulted and hazed their students for genera-
tions.” -Walter Kim, The New York Times,
October 3, 1997. i

 

I don’t know how many of you read TheNew
York Times, so it’s likely you missed Kirn’s
column. In light ofthe alcohol-related deaths of
two fraternity pledges in the last few weeks and
his Aownexperiences” as an undergraduate at
Princeton, Kirn believes all fraternities and so-
rorities should be abolished, saying that frater-
nities and other social clubs “exploit students’
desperate hunger to fit in” by encouraging, even
pressuring them to drink heavily.

Kim is sadly mistaken if he believes the
pressure to fit in and the pressure to drink
are restricted solely

five after five, and we stayed until the bouncers
kicked us out at five after 10. Suffice to say,
this kind of offer doesn’t encourage the aver-
age college student to merely sip his beer.
Laterthat night (or so I was told by my incredu-
lous friend the next morning), I dove head-first
off a bunk bed onto the concrete floor. Yet,
strangely, I didn’t see a fraternity man all night
or go anywhere near a fraternity house.
However, Kirn’s column makes a more
damaging assertion, at least indirectly. What
he is saying is that fraternity and soroity houses
are nothing more than places to drink and
party. I don’t believe this is true. Being an
officer in a fraternity or sorority can provide
excellent leadership or ﬁnancial experience.
As far as I know, every fraternity on this
campus maintains a cold test file, designed to
help their brothers succeed academically. Many
fraternities do fundraisers or other community
service projects. Last weekend, for example,
Beta held afoosball tournament to help pay the
funeral expenses for their cook, who died over
the summer.

to college fraterni- ‘‘
ties. My first year-
and-a-half of high
school was miser-
able, basically be-
cause I didn’t drink,
while everyone else
did.Oncelwas more
or less dragged out

Kim is sadly mistaken
if he believes the pres-
sure to fit in and the
pressure to drink are
restricted solely to
college fraternities...

So why, then, are
fraternities’ reputa-
tions so poor? The po-
tential to do the posi-
tive things mentioned
above go untapped
more often than not.
Think about how fra-
ternities sell them-
” selves to potential new

of my house by some
teammates on the
basketball team to drink with them, the last
two-and-a-half years of high school was a
wild ride and a crazy time. Alcohol opened
the door to all that fun.

Kirn also cites surveys that show fraternity
members drink more and are more likely to
engage in binge drinking. I have no surveys to
back up my claims, but rather some powerful
anecdotal evidence l’ve picked up on my visits
to other college campuses, places Kirn probably
hasn’t been to in 20 years.

Two years ago, during Thanksgiving
break, I went to see a friend of mine at
Marist College. I arrived at his dorm room
around 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon. My
friend asked me if I wanted to go to a
“drink-up” at a bar in town, which consisted
of all the beer you could drink for five
dollars from 5-10 p.m.

Once these freshmen pledge, what do
fraternities do to show pledges that there
is more to fraternity life than band parties
and kegs in the country? Fraternities make
themselves easy targets by encouraging
portrayals of themselves as nothing more
than a place to party.

Fraternities are under siege. I guarantee
that there are college administrators
throughout the country reading Kirn’s col-
umn and agreeing wholeheartedly with
what he proposes. Fraternities here aren’t
threatened. Not yet, anyway. Fraternities
need to differentiate themselves from two
dollar pitcher specials at The Palms. Oth-
erwise, when you come back for Alumni
Weekend ten years from now, your frater-
nity house may be substance-free, and fra-
ternity-free as well.

Highschool textbooks in Lex?

True story:

Wednesday in my 9 a.m. class,
Sarah Meldrum informs me that I
should stop by the library to pick up
alost item.

“A what?” I ask.

_“You left somethingthere last year,

‘W-an Hick ROW

  

and you should go pick it up,” she
repeats. “Your name is on the list.”

That’s strange, I think. I don’t
remember losing anything last year.
So I forget about it.

Class ends; I do homework, eat
lunch, go to lab. An uneventful day.

At the end of lab, Sarah asks, “Are
you going to go to the library to get
your lost item?”

Yeah, I think I will, I say. I am
curious to see what they have waiting
for me. '

At the circulation desk of the li-
brary, I find the list of people who

, have left things at the library.

My name is on it. It’s misspelled,
but it’s me.

I tell Kelley Joy from across the
desk that I lost something last year.

“It’s Balsley,” right?” she asks.

“Yes,” I say, “but it’s misspelled.” .

Kelley walks to a set of shelves,

looks around a little, and pulls down
something and hands it to me.

“Here you go,” she says.

I look at my lost item.

“What is this?” I ask.

Before me sits a large, burgundy
book, about the size and weight of a
Bible. I ﬂip through it a little.

Kelley asks, “What?”

Kelley again asks, “What?”

I turn to the front of the book again.

Pizza in the Co-op:
morning, noon and night

BY SYBIL 

STAFF \WRrrF.R

learned long ago: “Leave the cooking to someone else.”
In past years the Co-op would follow its own recipes to
make the dough and sauce for the pizzas. The chef du jour

It’s 10 p.in. on a Tuesday. You have about hundred might add a little more of this or a little less of that - the

hours left of studying to do and your
stomach is as empty as a beer bottle
on a Friday night. Your taste buds are
screaming “pizza, pizza,” but your
wallet is screaming “Hey, don’t look
at me! I haven’t seen anything green
for a week.”

What do you do? Well, you could
join the hundreds of other Washing-
ton and Lee students who have
discovered the delicious yet “wallet
comforting" taste of Stone Willy’s Pizza.

 

W&L’s Co-op rescued students from the “I’m too poor

to call Dominoes or Pizza Hut” blues. Cheese

lovers,

carnivores and veggie lovers can satisfy their pizza

cravings at the Co-op.

“The sausage pizza was good; I genuinely enjoyed it,”

said Sonia Hall, sophomore. "

This is a 180-degree turn around from the feelings
students held about prior pizzas. “Last year’s pizza was

really bad,” recalled, Ezter Bados, sophomore.

What accounts for this sharp contrast? Well, it’s a
simple concept that kitchen illiterates and couch potatoes

result? Less than appetizing.

“Now we buy pre-made dough
and sauce,” says co-op manager Don
Burch. “The result is a better quality
pizza with a more consistent taste,”

W&L students show their appre-
ciation for the tongue-tempting treat
by purchasing almost nine hundred
pizzas a week. That’s a lot of dough!

Probably a lot more than Miss
Willia P. Stone ever expected.

According to the legend, Miss Willia P. Stone was the
world famous explorer, writer and culinary innovator who
founded the Stone Ground Flour and Breads Company.

But not all students are in favor of the ﬂavor. “It tastes
average if you’re really hungry. I wouldn’t eat it if I had
another choice,” said Colleen Benjamin, freshman.

“Sometimes it’s good, sometimes it’s not.” Senior
David Butler adds, “Either way it’s too expensive.”

The majority of W&L students, however,

their way.

ry may be a typical name,
but Mary Taylor New is far
from a typical girl. This
modest senior may be Washington

Born and bred in Richmond, Va.,
New continued a family tradition by
a tt e n d i n g
W&L after
g r a d u a t i n g
from St.
Catherine’s
School. “My
grandfather,
father and two
older brothers
came here,
but I am the
first girl!”
says Mary.

New began studying the violin at
the age of three. After four years,
New’s music teacher, an accom-
plished cellist, could no longer teach
her the violin. At the tender age of
seven, New exhausted her teacher’s
knowledge of the violin.

Instead of finding another teacher,
New decided on a new instrument, the
cello. She began studying the cello
for many reasons, the most instru-
mental being comfort.“I like the cello
better because I can sit rather than
stand,” New remarks.

Fourteen years later, New still
plays the cello, but does not consider
herself an expert. It has taken time
for her to become comfortable with
her playing expertise, especially us-
ing the classical style.

“There can be no expert in music,”
New professes modestly. “It is a
learning process and every day I learn

midst:

and appreciate something new.”

The striking thing about New is
that she is not a stereotypical musi-
cian. Most other musicians ofNew’s
caliber are studying at music schools.

“They all have friends who are
musicians,” she says ofmusic school
students, “Whereas my friends are
not, and well, I am in a sorority.”

Although music is a major part of
New’s life, it is not her life. New
practices for two hours every day, not
including rehearsals and perfor-
mances, but this has not affected her
social life. Not only is she a member
of Kappa Kappa Gamma, but she is
also a member of Kathekon.

“Music is part of my daily rou-
tine,” New said. “It always has been
and always will be.”

Perhaps New’s artistic streak runs
in the family. “My mother is very

“I attend music festivals every
summer,” she says, “But although I
do not know exactly what I want to
do, I know that I do not want to be a
professional player.”

Most recently, New attended the
De Boudoin Summer Music Festival.
While there, she was tutored by a pro-
fessor from the prestigious Julliard
School of the Arts. This summer,
she realized how much she would
prefer to teach than perform profes-
sionally.

New finds it challenging and re-
warding to perform for children. “I
love teaching,” she says. “I really
want to teach music and I think that
is what I will do.”

Both at home in Richmond and
here in Lexington, she has performed
for kindergartens.

Amzx CHRISTENSEN
———j—~— MOVIE Game

I want to like George Clooney. But
I must admit that the actual movies
themselves, while often featuring good
work by Clooney, have been less than
stellar. “From Dusk Till Dawn” was
sub-par; “One Fine Day” forgettable;
“Batman and Robin” embarrassing.

That’s why I was so glad to see a
movie which is good, solid entertain-
ment and in which Clooney’s charac-
ter both is likable and kicks ass.

The Peacemaker,” starring Clooney
and Nicole Kidman, is one of those
rare actioners in which the story is
believable, the pace taut, the
storytelling lean and the acting above
average. “Executive Decision”comes
to mind as another good example.
Unlike such obvious fakery as “The
Saint” and “Air Force One,” the ad-
mittedly Hollywood-ized political
background of “The Peacemaker”

Fancy Dress concert.

I, for one, hope that we will not be
visited by another rap band. I do not
dislike rap: I dislike rap concerts.
They are as entertaining as double-
entry bookkeeping.

The rap industry’s old
standbys are getting old.
Nearly every rapper, since
Grandmaster Flash first
entered the industry in the
early 1980s, has turned to the
audience at some point
during his or her concert and
said, “Somebody yell ho!”

Who is this ho? What has
this ho done to deserve so

much attention? Doesn’t she get

tired of us yelling at her every
time the SAB schedules a Fancy

doesn’t stretch credulity to the break-
ing point.

The unique feature of “The Peace-
maker” among action ﬂicks is that it
plays remarkably like a very smart
“60 Minutes” report in which Mike
Wallace acutally has enough live foot-
age. There is literally no wasted space,
even through an extended hijacking
prologue some have labeled boring. I
found it fascinating to watch. A hi-
jacking is essentially a secret, quiet,
eminently physical crime. Mostﬁlms
would out much of the actual physical
activity to focus on the muscular con-
frontations typical of the genre.
Schwarzenegger would grunt, “Your
presence on this locomotive has be-
come superﬂuous!” and throw some-
one over the side. Mimi beder, the
former “ER” directorwho helms “The
Peacemaker,” resists this temptation,
and comes up with something inter-
esting and gripping. To see simply
the hijacking take place without a lot
of talk and bluster is a joy. It’s prob-
ably stretching things to compare this
sequence to Dziga-Viertov’s “Man
with a Camera,” but only a little. The

Dress concert?

I know that I grow tired of yelling
at her. I also get tired of watching
rappers walk around the stage in an
effort to appear energetic.

After a while, I begin to feel as
though I am watching a track meet.
A very noisy track meet. A very
noisy track meet where the runners
move slowly in small circles.

Rap concerts quickly
become tedious. I don’t
feel obliged to wave
my arm because

   
  
   
 
 
 
  
 

“I am a true
player.” I’d
rather not “give
it up” for
anyone’s
disc jockey.

Rappers’
amazing ability

to link words

which rhyme (see
also Dr. Seuss)

motivate me to
yell “make money money make
money money money.”

So who should the SAB bring to
campus this spring? That should be

same powerful kineticism of pure vi-
sual storytelling keeps the images from
being anything but boring.

And we haven’t even seen Clooney
and Kidman yet. Clooney plays Lt.
Tom Devoe, a sort of an independent
operator who specializes in undercover
work to discover and contain nuclear
weapons smuggling. Kidman is Julia
Kelly, the interim director of the White
House Nuclear Smuggling Group.
When ten warheads are stolen from a
train in Russia, and one is exploded,
Kelly and Devoe have to work to-
gether to get the remaining nine back.

I should mention that George
Clooney is very much a television
actor. His little mannerisms and facial
expressions are very limited. He al-
ways plays the same kind of character
(when he plays his character well) that

and is always being forgiven for his
little mistakes and foibles. I don’t
mean there isn’t a lot of room within
those parameters for him to have a
great career; there certainly is. But
this may be part of the reason he hasn’t

attracting a band
to campus.
Wherever the
student body can play a
role, though, it should. I
would like to thank the SAB

for the work, time and commit-
ment which they dedicate to
arranging concerts at Washington
and Lee.

Although I have not appreciated
the groups which have perfonned at
Fancy Dress recently, I appreciate the
work that the SAB put into obtaining
those bands.

My personal, subjective opinions
on music do not reﬂect my opinion
of the SAB. They deserve the same
commendation as any other hard-
working group on campus.

Ijust hope they don’t bring
back another rap band. Washington ’
and Lee has many traditions;
bringing a rap band to FD shouldn’t
be one of them.

GEORGE CLOONEY

The State. Catch it this

Clooney’s a real star
aaaof 4 stars —The pitch: “|t’|| be like,
‘Mission: Impossible’ with a plot.’’

rather have him in our living rooms
where he can charm us in person. His
likability still comes across on the big
screen.

Kidman and Clooney have a real
chemistry in the film, though it is
never the subject of the film. The last
thing I wanted was a “Speed”—Iike
“now we’re boyfriend and girlfriend
because we went through so much
together” ending.

Instead, they have some real con-
ﬂict and emotional sequences together
but focuson theirwork, as they should.
Very little is hackneyed about the plot
of this film.

Even the villain is well-portrayed
(and I won’t spoil it by saying who it
is). This is pretty rare. We don’t
sympathize with him, but we believe
him, and that’s enough.

Overall, “The Peacemaker” is a
promising debut for the new
Dreamworks SKG studio. This
Christmas will bring “Mouse Hunt”
and Steven Spielberg’s “Amistad,” and
we’ll see if they can keep dodging
convention and making money at the
same time.
