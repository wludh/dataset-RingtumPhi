“The Flat’
unayordoesnﬁ
like to party

(I)Residents claim Lex-
ington Mayor Buddy
Derrick had police
break up their parties
without due cause.

BY ERIC SWENSEN
‘WW STAFF V/VRJTER

Most Washington and Lee students
are familiar with the sight of
Lexington’s finest breaking up a
party. But how often do you see
the_ mayor of the town breaking up
a party?

It happened Friday and Saturday,
Sept. 5-6, to the tenants of 109 W.
Nelson St., otherwise known as “The
Flat,” which is owned by Mayor H.E.
“Buddy” Derrick wife and his wife,
Martha Lou.

Martha Lou runs the College Town
Shop lbcated below The Flat.

The problems began that Friday
when Mrs. Derrick, saw seniors

{‘ Erik Christ and Aaron Michalove

taking four cases of beer upstairs to
the apartment.

According to Christ, one of the
apartment’s tenants, Mrs. Derrick re-

,4 minded him and Michalove that

kegs were not allowed in the apart-
ment and asked if a party was be-
ing held that night.

“I told her we were having people
over,” Christ said.

Around 1 a.m., Lexington Police
Officer Keith Harroway pulled up to
the apartment.

“ “He had no reason to pull up since

there was no noise from The Flat au-
dible on the street,” Flat resident Doug
Hesney said.

According to Hesney, Harroway

~51 told him and his roommates that Der-

rick had ordered the police to patrol
for parties at 109 W. Nelson St.

The Flat was given a warning,
but no noise violation was issued

‘ that night

There had been no problems at the
apartment since 1994, when a spilled
keg caused approximately $20,000
worth of damage to the College Town

. Shop, Hesney said.

Lexington Police Chief Bruce M.

Beard says that 109 W. Nelson St. was

learns

not singled out by Derrick, but that
the police were instructed to be on the
lookout for parties "anywhere they
weren’t supposed to be.” That in-
cluded most apartments in Lexington,
Beard said.

Derrick, after receiving a call from
the police department, arrived at The
Flat around 2:30 a.m., Hesney said.
Christ told Derrick that there would
be another party the next night, and a
meeting was set up between the Der-
ricks and The Flat’ 5 tenants for Mon-
day, Sept. 8.

As promised, another party was
thrown the next night. Again, The
Flat was visited by police, this time
by Sgt. Alfonso Miller. According
to Hesney, Miller had instructions
to call the mayor.

Minutes later, the mayor arrived.

“Mayor Derrick threatened to evict
us,” Hesney said.

From that, Hesney added, the con-
versation degenerated into a shouting
match. Again, The Flat was given a
warning, but no noise violation.

The main point of contention be-
tween the Derricks and their tenants
is a provision in the lease that prohib-

its “large parties, extra-fraternity par- ‘ ‘

ties or kegs.” Hesney noted that there
have been parties three to four times
the size of the parties on Sept. 5-6 that
caused no damage and were not bro-
ken up by the police.

The meeting on Sept. 8 did noth-
ing to resolve the matter.

“It looked like the dispute might
go to court,” Flat tenant Andy Scott
said. “It became apparent that things
couldn’t be talked out.”

Despite that, Scott went down to
The College Town Shop and met with
the Derricks.

“Basically, I apologized and
made peace,” Scott said. “I told
them we wanted to get out of the
lease without penalty.”

It quickly became apparent, how-
ever, that escaping the lease would
not be easy-or free. Hesney, Scott
and Christ discussed the matter with
Dean of Students David Howison
and their realtors.

Both the realtor and Howison told
them the same thing: They had a “le-

gallybinding” lease with the Derricks.
If they were released from the lease.

they would have to continue paying
rent until new tenants were found for
The Flat.

“We realized we couldn’t afford to
leave,” Scott said.

The Flat’ 5 tenants want to stay,
Scott said, but they realize that it won’t

be easy.

Junior
faces

felony
charge

BY HEATHER MCDONALD
:-——?-—— STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee junior
Elizabeth James was arrested and

charged with a felony for failing to
stop after hitting sophomore Dylan
P. Walsh with her Volkswagen bug
last Saturday.

According to the arresting officer,
Michael Hess, Walsh was walking
east along West Nelson Street that
evening when he was struck on the
left leg and thrown to the ground by a
car traveling in the same direction.
The driver of the car stopped, yelled
“sorry” out the window and drove off.

James, who is from San Anto-
nio, Texas, refused to comment on
the incident.

Walsh, who only suffered minor
injuries to his left leg, went to the
Lexington Police Department and
reported the description of the car
and state tags. James’ car matched
the description and license plate.
She was arrested approximately 9"
minutes later.

“She was upset,” Hess said.
“And she knew Walsh. She said she
was sorry.”

It is indeterrninable whether alco-
hol played a factor in the incident, due
to the 90 minutes which passed be-
fore James’ arrest, Beard said.

However, both the driver and the
victim had been drinking, Hess said.
But, due to the lapse in time, James
could have been drinking after the
time of the accident.

Walsh did not return repeated
phone calls from the Phi.

James has been charged with a class-
six felony hit and run. lfconvicted, she
could spend one to ﬁve years in prison,

“We have to repair a damaged re-
lationship,” Scott said.

Scott, Christ and Hesney are
now in a holding pattern, waiting
for a phone call from Derrick to
set up another meeting to discuss
the situation.

Mrs. Derrick declined to comment.

with a minimum of 12 months in jail,
and/or be ﬁned $2,500. Her court date
is set for Oct. 28.

However, several sources say that
the charges against James may be
dropped because Walsh did not sus-
tain serious injuries and is not actively
pursuing the matter.

Jim Gilmore, brought a personal touch to politics
with her talk to Washington and Lee’s College
Republicans Monday night.

After an introduction by College Republicans Presi-
dent Kevin Funk, Gilmore, a professor at Randolph-Ma-
con College, proceded to shake hands and meet every
member present.

Funk announced to the members that Virginia has the

4 Roxanne Gilmore, wife of gubernatorial candidate

I best College Republican involvement in the nation, and

that it is important for W&L’s group of young leaders to
continue the tradition. He then discussed the signiﬁcant
points of Jim Gilmore’s platform.

In an aside from the political aspect of the meeting,
Gilmore told of how she and Jim ﬁrst met. They were
both undergraduates at University of Virginia and became
involved in the College Republicans group there. Their
first “date” was a door-to-door political campaign.

“There is a tremendous tradition of support at W&L,”
Gilmore said. “We were delighted to be here for the ﬁrst

A College Republicans meeting. And Rockbridge is not in-
signiﬁcant. We want to win the (Shenandoah) Valley,
and right now we’re ahead.”

. Some people, especially those students from out-of-
atate, wondered what, if any, difference they could make

B _y helping with this election.

“You might ask yourself, ‘Does it really matter
what I do?’” Mrs. Gilmore said. “It does, you can

actually reach people.”

The states of Virginia and New Jersey will hold the
only two elections in the country this year, and are said by
some to be representative of how the country will vote in

the next presidential election.

“This election isn’t about Jim Gilmore  it’s about you
all. You have to decide what kind of state and what kind
of country you want in the next century.”

STAFF WRITER

Renovations to Reid Hall will make the building known
as the J -School more user-friendly for students and fac-
ulty by creating more oﬂice, classroom and storage space.

As the building now stands, it resembles a maze, with
some faculty offices tucked to one side of the library and
one classroom reachable only after passing through a stor-
age area.

“The building has been haphazardly filled in and
remodeled over the years, making the feel and tem-
peratures of the place totally inadequate," says Profes-
sor Hampden Smith, head of the Journalism and Mass
Communications department.

That will change under the renovations planned. The
journalism department is "most pleased” with the pre-
liminary architectural drawings, Smith said. He describes
the renovations as “a complete gutting” that will provide
“full digital access in all classrooms and labs.“

Along with the computer labs, the broadcast studio’s
planned redesign will serve student needs better.

The changes have no timetable yet, since there is
no place for the journalism department to go during
construction. Smith anticipates waiting for another
structure to be built, which would "provide fallow
space” for the department. He guesses that the wait
will be about five years, but admits that might be
pessimistic.

Cable 2 and WLUR will continue to run during the
renovations, but possibly with striking differences. Cable
2 may only run packages, Smith points out. because there
might not be a studio.

Women’s soccer romps Hollins and VWC,
continuing undefeated dominance in ODAC

BY FRANCES GROBERG
WWW STAFF WRITE}

The women’s soccer team extended
their winning streak this week, defeat-
ing Hollins 10-0 on Thursday and Vir-
ginia Wesleyan 6-1 on Saturday.

Junior Karin Treese became the
leading scorer in W&L history with
her third hat trick of the season Thurs-
day against Hollins. Treese’s goal to-
tal stands at 41. She had nine goals in
the ﬁrst four games this season, but
did not score Saturday against VWC.

“Treese not being a scoring factor
yesterday and still winning certainly
says a lot about the depth of the team,”
said Coach Jan Hathom.

Both games were decisive victories
for the Generals, as the women con-
tinue to assert themselves and move
to 3-0 in the ODAC conference.

“I thought VWC was supposed to
be a hard game for (the team),” ex-

Athletic Director Mike Walsh prob-
ably said it best Saturday when he
asked, “Is Junior Lord ﬁnally a senior?”

Lord, along with the rest of the
Guilford Quaker team took advantage
of several Generals’ turnovers and de-
feated W&L 34-20 on Saturday.

The Generals and Quaker offenses
both took some time tq get ﬁred up
with the score deadlocked at zero for
almost the entire ﬁrst quater. However,
the Quakers struck ﬁrst and then hit

hard for the rest of the game.

Lord and William Rochelle each
gained signiﬁcant receiving yardage
with Rochelle having almost two hun-
dred yards by the third quarter. But,
the exciting part of the contest was
pushed to the ﬁnal quarter.

With the Generals leading 20-19 af-
ter a failed two-point conversion, the
Quakers took advantage of another
Generals turnover and marched down
the ﬁeld scoring on a touchdown pass.
After a successful two-point conver-
sion the General took over poised to

    

claimed one fan at the end of
Saturday’s game.

It certainly didn’t turn out that way.
Just nine minutes into the game, se-
nior Erica Reineke scored on a cross
from junior Caroline Keen. Neither
team was able to dominate for the re-
mainder of the half, but the Generals
exploded after halftime with 5 goals.

Deidre Coyle and Kelly Norton in-
creased the spread to 3-0 early in the
second half, scoring just under two
minutes apart. Twenty minutes later,
Christy Meade and Samantha Garbish
scored 55 seconds apart to increase
their lead to a dominant 5-0.

“Yesterday’s win (and the ﬁve goal
margin) was a pleasant and wonderful
surprise,” Hathom said. “It’s usually
a one-goal game and sometimes we
go into overtime. It’s been a long time
since I’ve seen a VWC team give up
like that.”

Kelli Brubaker of VWC scored the
Marlins’ lone goal soon after that to
decrease the Generals’ lead to 5- 1, but
freshman Lindsay Williams answered
15 minutes later with the last goal of
the game, making the ﬁnal score 6- 1.

On Thursday against Hol1ins,Treese
added an assist to her hat trick as she
continued to be a force on the ﬁeld.
Junior Caroline Keen and Freshman
Shana Levine both added a goal and
an assist against Hollins. Ginny
Jemigan, Courtney Nolan, Samantha
Garbisch, Erica Reineke and Lindsay
Williams also scored goals for W&L
in the rout.

Next on the Generals’ schedule are
be two games in North Carolina. The
women will play at Guilford on Satur-
day and at Greensboro on Sunday. The
next home game will be Tuesday, Oc-
tober 2, at 4:30 against Sweet Briar on
the Liberty Hall Fields.

“Our team has a lot of potential han-

no one in this conference we cannot
compete with,” states tailback Floyd
Young. “There’s no reason that we
can’t be successful in the ODAC.”

The Generals have definitely
showed signs of progression with
outstanding performances by the
younger players and should do well
this season. The Generals next test
will be here in Lexington next Satur-
day at 1:30 p.m. against Centre when
the team will hold their annual Hall of

will be inducted into the W&L Sports

It happened in an instant. Vir-
ginia Wesleyan scored two goals
near the end of the ﬁrst half and
effectively neutralized Washington
and Lee for the remainder of
Saturday’s Old Dominion Athletic
Conference men’s soccer game.
VWC went on to shut out Wash-
ington & Lee 3-0 in the ﬁrst league
game of the season.

“We got spanked by a very good
team,” Coach Rolf Piranian said. “I
doubt we will play anybody better
this year. We sulfered failure, but
failure is fertilizer that will help make
us a better team.” .

After posting an impressive of-
fensive display in their 4-2 victory
over Christopher Newport on
Wednesday, the men’s soccer team
performed dismally on Saturday
against VWC and were unable to
put any passing plays together, es-
pecially in the offensive third.

“They weren’t any better than
us. They just played better as a
team,” freshman Scott Lofranco
stated. “We played pretty well in
the ﬁrst half, before they scored the
goals.”

Coming into the week the Gen-

Two quick goals
paralyze men’s soccer

erals knew that they had two very
tough challenges before them in
Christopher Newport and VWC.
Before the season opened Coach
Rolf Piranian had identiﬁed these
two inatch-ups as perhaps the big-
gest games of the season.

“Christopher Newport is a huge
game for us,” stated senior captain
Kingsley Chukwu last Friday, “The
whole team is pretty up for it."

Indeed they were. It took only
two and a half minutes for sopho-
more Jamie Parker to score a goal
off of a free kick from just outside
the penalty area. Later in the half
junior Sam Chase smashed in a
header off of a corner kick from
sophomore Ben Thompson. Senior
Gordon Meeker’s unassisted goal
early in the second half seemed to
put the game in the bag.

Then, late in the second half
Christopher Newport scored two
goals in an eight and a half minute
span to come within one goal of
the lead. However, John Wilson‘s
superb near post goal with five
minutes remaining iced the win for
the Generals.

The Generals’ next game is at
home at 4:00 p.m. on Thursday
against Emory & Henry and is a
must-win ODAC matchup.

Dallas did not beat Philadelphia

 

I thought I

 had just about
seen it all —- then I

 watched the
Monday Night

Football fiasco

 last week.
Q For 58 min-
“Con utes, the Philadel-
B°°}‘wa1l'°r phia Eagles bea
'98

the Dallas Cow-

boys. Not only

beat them, but demoralized them. De-

‘spite starting almost every possession
’ from near midﬁeld, the once-potent
, Cowboys offense was held to ﬁve ﬁeld

goals and trailed 20-15 with two min-
utes left. But a pass-interference pen-
alty, which should have been waved

. off because the ball was tipped, gave
Dallas new life and set up a ridiculous

ﬁnal minute.

After a touchdown pass slipped
past a Philly nickelback and into the
hands of Cowboy Anthony Miller, Ty

I Detmer drove the Eagles down to the

Dallas 5, settng up a gimme ﬁeld goal

- for Chris Boniol. Of course, the holder
- then made a horrible mistake by fum-
' bling the snap and trying to run the

ball into the end zone (fumbling again
in the process) instead of resetting the
ball. So Dallas ran off the ﬁeld cel-

1 ebrating a 21-20 victory they know
they didn’t deserve.

There are two ways you can deal

1 with your favorite team losing in such

agonizing fashion: chug a twelve-pack

and trash your apartment or try to ra-
tionalize. My apartment didn’t need
to be trashed this early, so I tried the
latter option.

I came to this not-so-stunning con-
clusion: the Cowboys are no longer
great. Good, but not great. Moreover,
the don’t seem to care. This was pain-
fully obvious on the game’s ﬁnal play
when the Cowboys hardly attempted
a kick rush. Considering Barry Switzer,
the NFL’s version of Matt Foley, moti-
vational speaker, labeled the game
“must-win,” one would have thought
his Cowboys would be ﬂying across
the line of scrimmage to bloack the
kick. But they were defeated and they
knew it.

The times are a’ changin’ in Big D.
Much of the media circus usually sur-
rounding the Cowboys has either
diappeared or vacated to Green Bay.
This is actually a disadvantage to the
Cowboys, who have thrived on an us-
against-the-world attitude for years.
Their opening game against Pitts-
burgh and Kordell Stewart was in-
tensely hyped, and the Cowboys
steamrolled the Steelers. But without
the same media attention the last two
weeks, the Cowboys have appeared
lost. Last week, the Cardinals trailed
22-7, fumbled the ball in overtime and
still beat Dallas for the ﬁrst time since
1990. Against the Eagles, Dallas came
out so flat that Michael Irvin was
throwing helmets on the sideline and
the crowd began booing. The Cow-

boys are undoubtedly still potent, but
the sight of them running onto the ﬁeld
no longer frightens teams. They prob-
ably have the league’s best defense,
but the defensive front seven are sus-
pect and the offensive line is no longer
pancaking defenders on every play.
And Emmitt Smith has yet to ﬁnd the
end zone this year.

Dallas won the ﬁrst battle, but the
war has yet to be won. The Cowboys
can be beaten, and no longer just by
the NFL’s elite. Now if their opponents
can hold onto their ﬁeld goal snaps...

Meanwhile, things hit rock-bottom
for the Eagles’ coach Ray Rhodes.
Rhodes, who is in a good mood about
as often as Dick Butkus and Howie
Long attend an opera, was still digest-
ing the previous night’s horriﬁc loss
on the way to his ofﬁce Tuesday mom-
ing when he was rear-ended. Rhodes,
of course, refusec medical attention.
Wonder what he has to day to the
other driver?

At least Rhodes has found out the

I last two weeks that his team is more
than capable of beating the NFL’s elite.
Once again, parity is the rule of the
league. Green Bay has hardly looked
impressive and the 49ers are worried
about Steve Young’s head. Will this
be the year Denver, New England or
some other AFC team breaks through
in the Super Bowl? Or will those
trendy Tampa Bay Bucs reign su-
preme? After last Monday night’s
game, anything is possible.

Volleyball

The Generals volleyball team,
after last weekend’s second-place
finish in the W&L Invitational,
opened its Old Dominion Athletic
Conference regular season this
week with matches against Emory
& Henry and Sweet Briar.

They continued their winning
ways in both showdowns, winning
15-13,15-13, 9-15 and 15-11 over
E&H on Tuesday and 15-0, 15-6 and

15-6 over Sweet Briar on Thursday.
The two wins push their ODAC regu-
lar-season winning streak to nineteen
straight victories and their record to
5-1 (2-0). »..

In the first match against E&H, the
Generals were able to win a tough 3-1
decision, which saw them come back
from a 13-5 deﬁcit in the second game,
behind strong offensive games from
sophomore Nancy Reinhart, junior
Megan Snodrass and senior Hillary

Martin. Reinhart led the stat book,
compiling 14 kills, 12 digs and 3
aces, while Snodgrass added 12 kills,
12 digs and 3 blocks. Martin was
third on the team with 1 1 kills. Cur-
rently, Reinhart leads the ODAC in
kills per game, with an impressive
average of 3.27.

picked last in the preseason poll, the
Generals cruised to an easy victory.
The games were dominated by the
Generals, highlighted by long
stretches of W&L service points
only occasionally interrupted by a
Sweet Briar sideout or desperate
timeout. Snodgrass and freshmen
Mary Beth Brookby added to the
Generals’ attack, which only had to
get the ball over the net and wait.
Snodgrass had five aces and

Brookby added three.
The Generals’ next game is Tues-
day at ODAC foe Roanoke College.

Cross Country

W&L men’s and women’s cross
country teams proved ungracious
hosts Saturday in cruising to easy vic-
tory in the Washington and Lee Cross
Country invitational.

Both teams had little trouble in dis-
posing of the overmatched Southern
Virginia and Shenandoah squads. in
the men’s race, W&L had the first
eight ﬁnishers across the line with
Greg Ruthig leading a pack of ﬁve
W&L runners who ﬁnished within two
seconds of each other.

in the women’s race, W&L had the
first ten finishers with Natalia
Dorofeeva ﬁnishing as the individual
winner. This Saturday the two teams
travel to different locales, with the men
heading to Courtland State and the
women at the Dickenson Open.

Water Polo

The water polo team proved they
deserved to play on the varsity level
this past weekend, demolishing their
four club opponents by a total score
of 61-19.

“The competition was not up to
our level,” said senior captain Ben
Yemini. “They didn’t have the swim-
mers to keep up with us.”

The University of Virginia was
the first to fall to the Generals 15-5.
The University of Maryland was
beaten l5-4 by the Generals,
Georgetown fell by a score of 16-8
and W&L dominated Rutgers 15-2.

The Generals will get their shot
at varsity competition in the Divi-
sion Ill championships later this fall.

iE§§§Fancy Dress Is Off;

BY RITA ENNIS
Another tradition bites the dust.
[here will be no Fancy Dress Ball
this year. Skip Nottberg, President
of Dance Board, announced at the
Executive Committee meeting Mon-
day night that because of a greatly
reduced budget and past history of
student disinterest, Fancy Dress has

been cancelled for this year.

See Editorial Comment, Page 2

In other EC action, the Student
Body “Open Forum” was scheduled
for tonight at 7:00 pm. in the, Cock-
pit. Student Body P-resident Fran
Lawrence commented that he “would
like to make the ‘Open Forums’
monthly even-ts if student interest
warrants it.”

-President Lawrence also slated
another set -of Freshman EC “Dorm
Conversations” for tomorrow night.
The purpose of these conversations
is_to discuss student government and
the honor system.

Nottberg presented an extensive
report to EC concerning Dance
Board activities and plans. Concerts
are scheduled for Oct. 9 with the
New York Rock Ensemble and
Sweetwater and Nov. 13 with Char-
lie Byrd. A concert in late February
featuring James Taylor is being
planned. Nott-berg said that door
sales from these three concerts
would determine other entertain-
ment. Due to a sharp decrease in
Dance Pl-an purchases, the Dance
Board is operating on a budget of
about $17,000.

The EC heard a report from chair-
man Dan Silberberg concerning pro-
gress towards the 1972 Mock Con-
vention. In addition, the Committee
discussed the Lexington license tags
which students are required to pur-
chase, -but no official position was
taken.

The Ring-Tum Phi began one hun-
dred years ago as a score sheet for ath-
letic clubs, and today it is one of the
two student-published newspapers on
Washington and Lee’s campus.

The name of the paper, taken from
an old football cheer, denotes the origi-
nal intent of the paper. Today many
students do not know how the name
came about, like many who do not re-
alize the history the paper has covered
and the changes it has undergone.

In discussion with different profes-
sors on campus who have seen the pa-
per change over the years or have only
been witness to recent issues, a person
comes to know that the Phi is forever

of the paper. “Co-education was exten-
sively covered from many different
angles.”

Taylor Sanders, professor of history
and university historian who came to
W&L in 1969, mentioned the period
during which there were two Phis-- one
printed on Tuesday and the other on
Thursday.

“The two papers were printed by the
same press, but they took different po-
litical slants and faced off against each
other editorially,” Sanders said. He
thinks there was a calm period after the
second Phi died and there was only one
paper on campus, but believes now that
we again have two papers “we are out
of the doldrums.”

A newcomer to the faculty, Assis-
tant Professor of Politics Eduardo
Velasquez admits that he does “read the
campus publications rather casually.”
‘‘I find the Phi informative and humor-
ous.” Velasquez notes that the paper is
a useful source of information cover-
ing what occurs on campus and what
students are doing. ‘‘I take it for what
it is, and it is good,” Velasquez said.

“What I read I enjoy.”

The longevity of the paper came as
a surprise to Velasquez, but Sanders re-
members the Phi covering big issues
such as integration and civil rights.
Sanders recalls “periods when it was
hard to ﬁnd kids to run the paper.”
“There were years when they did an
awful side on the business side-- in ads
and in circulation.”

“I hesitate to say it is better today
than in a previous heyday 20 years
ago,” Smith said. “There have been a
couple of wonderful FD issues over the
years. The most dramatic change (re-
cently) is the look of the paper which
has greatly improved.” Smith also calls
the Phi “a long tradition of generally
good independent student journalism.”

The paper is “off to a good start with
a lot of talented kids,” according to
Sanders.

Perhaps the most impressive aspect
of The Ring-tum Phi, as Smith points
out, is that it has “been able to sustain
itself and do as well as it has even in
poorer years with no active participa-
tion from faculty or advisers.”

Staking our claim

100 years ago, the editors ofThe Ring-tum
Phi declared thefollowing to be our mission
statement: -

It is with some embarrassment that the edi-
tors place the first number of The Ring-tum Phi

before the students. We hope, nevertheless,
that everyone will be lenient with our mistakes;
and, if you will kindly point them out to us and
help us out of the difficulties we will be very,
grateful to you. ‘

In a college of the size of Washington and Lee, a
medium other than the monthly literary magazine is
needed. It is our purpose to meet that demand. This
paper will in no way conﬂict with the Collegian.
Their purposes are entirely different. What we want
to do is to put all of the current college newswhere
it can be seen by every student, so that a fellow who
lives near the campus will know at least that there are
some students who live up town or out toward Buena
Vista. The drawback of having the students
board all over town is that they never know each
other. We want to help do away with this
drawback.

The Ring-tum Phi will not be the political
organ of any crowd. We think you will be
assured of that if you will look at the personnel
of the editorial board. We hope, however, that
every political question will be discussed in
these columns so that every one can see what
each side has to say for itself.

Our great object will be to keep up interest in
all of the college sports. We wan.t to let you
know what those sturdy fellows are doing day
by day as they work faithfully amidst dust and
grime, with sweat oozing from every pore, in
order that new honors may be heaped upon the
name of Washington and Lee, those fellows
who denythemselves all of the delicacies of life
in order that you may go out and cheer them to
victory. We want you to know how Oberlin can
hit that rush line, what a fine kick off Campbell
can make, how our backs can go skirting around
the ends. If we all know how these fellows work
we would be much more proud of our men when
they win and never complain when they lose.

If we can get out a paper which will interest
you, one which will. make you have more col-
lege spirit, one which will make you strive
harder to make the name of Washington and Lee
more glorious, we will be satisfied.

Turner donates
to wrong group

CNN founder Ted Turner,
a man who has done little of
importance in his life other

 

than buy the greatest pitching
lineup in the history of base-
ball, announced Thursday
night that he had a little too
much money lying around —-
a billion dollars, to be exact.
So what’s a multi-billionaire
media mogul to do but give it
allaway?

Don’t get me wrong: I
think philanthropy is one of
man’s most noble endeavors.
I just have a problem with
where that money is going.

Turner has decidedto found
a organization that will dis-
tribute $100 million, a year
over the next ten years to or-
ganizations run by the United
Nations. In addition, he an-
nounced Friday that he would
personally spendthe nextyear
soliciting money from some
of the world’s wealthiest in-
dividuals in hopes of raising
another billion dollars.

What’s wrong with trying
to help feed starving children
in Africa? Nothing — if only
that were what the money

would be used for. The United
Nations is a model of bureau-
cratic inefficiency. It is run
by a group of third-world so-
cialists who are more con-
cerned with ideological dema-
goguery than initiating practical
programs to help the suffering.

If Turner really wants to
make a difference, which I
think he does, he should cre-
ate an independent organiza-
tion that would distribute all
that money. A billion dollars
is certainly more than enough
to run such an organization, and
it could not be any less effective
than the United Nations.

Turner’s generosity should
not be maligned by his deci-
sion concerning who will re-
ceive his money. His inten-
tions are good, and in a world
where the rich are giving less
and less, his actions should
serve as an example.

There was a time in this
country when the wealthy
were frequent bestowers of
such gifts. Andrew Carnegie
gave millions of dollars for
the construction of libraries
across the country (including
one at Washington and Lee).
The Rockefellers, Vanderbilts
and Fords were all known for
their willingness to contrib-
ute millions to worthy causes.

None of my friends have ventured down
to visit me, so when I return home, I am the
first person they ask about college.

Usually,thefirstquestionis:“So,where
do you go to school again?” After I explain
that I do not attend William & Mary,
Washington & Jefferson, James Madison
or George Mason, my friends ask, “What’s
going to school in the South like?” This
question is usually voiced with a mixture
of curiosity and fear, as though the Civil
War still rages on and I am a soldier
trapped behind enemy lines.

It is difficult to summarize Washington
and Lee in a sentence, so I often use the
vague, lame line: “Well, W&L is a very
unique place.” Naturally, my. friends are
curious about what ‘C

My friends then give me the same look

Honestly, though, I love tailgating. It
is, without a doubt, one of the best tradi-

here combines so many wonderful ele-

member one time when the weather
was truly miserable.

Consider the incredible view from the
Ruins. How many tailgating sites offer a
view of the leaves changing color on the
Blue Ridge Mountains?

No tailgate is complete, of course, with-
out food and drink, and we go all out. This
Saturday, you probably saw chicken
wings, subs, vegetable plates and fully

stocked bars that included cheap beer and
Jim Beam, if nothing else. The plentiful
food and drink can present tailgaters with
interesting brain teasers, such as: How
do you drink a beer, eat chicken wings
and wipe the grease off your hands
without licking your fingers or put-
ting the beer down?

Observant readers have probably no-
ticed that I haven’t mentioned the actual
football game yet. That’s because the

tailgate, not the football game, is the main 5

event at W&L. If the football team were
ever dissolved, students here would react
the same way that fans of the Cleveland
Browns did after their team moved to
Baltimore: before every home game in
Baltimore, fans still gather in the parking
lot for their traditional pre-game tailgate.

Tailgating is not about sports. lnfact,
it’s much closer to a state of mind. Be-
sides, no matter what my comments last
week may have lead you to believe, I love
a good party.

Suffering through the county fair blues

It’s called the Clearfield County Fair, but a more
accurate name might be “Trailer Trash Freak Show.” lt’s
held the first week of August in the normally quiet

 

central Pennsylvania burg of Clearfield. That week the
waves of white trash flood in, washing away with it the
last remnants of culture and good taste.

How bad is Clearfield? Let’s just say that it makes
Lexington look sophisticated and hip in comparison.

I’ve gone to the fair practically ever year of my life as
part of a family reunion, held primarily so that all of us
can thank our grandparents for moving away from that
hell-hole back in the fifties. My God - ifthey hadn’t left,
that could be me in the trailer anxiously awaiting the new
Diamond Rio album!

Another reason we go is to see which washed-up
eighties band will be headlining this year. Two years ago
it was Firehouse, this year it was some band called Night
Ranger. Talk about going from bad to worse: from a
horrible eighties band to a horrible eighties band that no
one has ever heard of.

For us, the attraction of the fair doesn’t lie in the

tiresome rides or overpriced foods or even the tractor
pull, but in the people who show up and consider this the
highlightoftheiryear. These arethe folks whothinkthat
“Home Improvement” is the finest show on television.
As I walked around the fair, the Jefferson Airplane tune
“Crown of Creation” kept zipping through my head.
Geez, a few billion years of evolution and this is the
best that nature could come up with?

Let’s discuss some of the types of people who
come to the fair:

and a voice so hoarse that it makes Gary Busey
sound like a chipmunk. They want people to pay a
buck or two to play a rigged game where the only
prize is a crappy stuffed animal worth about eleven
cents. The fact that they manage to scratch out
some sort of living doing this speaks volumes about
the stupidity of Americans. The fact that I’ve actu-
ally wasted money on their games says plenty about
me, too.

@ Clown Girls. The teenage girls of Clearfield
are doing their part to keep Revlon in business.
Each of them applies so many pounds of makeup to
their faces that the clown in the dunk tank gets
jealous. And all of this to pick up the worthless

guys of Clearfield. What’s the point? We all know V

Letters to The Ring-tum Phi

Dear Editor,

I would like to take this oppor-
tunity to thank the Washington
and Lee community for providing
such an enthusiastic welcome to
the Class of 2001 duringthe Fresh-
man Orientation program. Of par-
ticular importance was the work
of the Freshman Orientation
Committee and its president, Neal
Kohl; the unﬂaggingly dedicated
committee chairmen: Amy
Kirouac, Anurag Chandra, Will
Olson, Stephen Komonytsky and
Charles Leddy. Our Dormitory
Counselors; the Orientation Group
Leaders; the Big Brothers and Big
Sisters; and Mrs. Bonnie Walker,
whose behind-the-scenes work
made much of orientation pos-
sible, all deserve our apprecia-
tion. All of these people gave
tirelessly of themselves, planning
and organizing orientation activi-
ties and staffing virtually every
orientation event——from Casino
Night to airport shuttles.

Thanks also go to: our Build-
ings and Grounds staff; our Food
Services staff who furnished the
culinary touches for several meet-
ings and special occasions; Jim
Farrar, Rob Mish, Frances Smith,
Kathekon, Southern Comfort,
JubiLee, General Admission and
Gordon Spice for the Alumni
Association BBQ; Kevin Batteh,
Professor Cecil and the Executive
Committee for such a meaningful
orientation to the Honor System.

Others too numerous to men-
tion also contributed to the Fresh-
man Orientation program, and this
general note must suffice as a
thank you. I am pleased that the
Class of 2001—our first class of
the new millennium—was the
beneficiary of such a community
effort!

Sincerely,

Dennis G. Manning

Dean ofthe F reshrnan Program _

Dear Editor,

The recent thefts at Washington and Lee have
illustrated that people outside of our community do
not abide by the Honor System. Recently, I have had
an experience which has taught me that they don’t care
if you do, either.

On May 14th, I went to the Lee-Hi Travel Plaza
with two of my friends. After our meal in Berky’s, I
bought a previously-viewed copy of Schindler’s List
for$] 4.99 plus tax at the truck stop store. I paid for our
food, which cost about $13, about $10 of gas and the
video with my MasterCard.

Unfortunately, with ﬁnals approaching, I didn’t
get to watch the video until after I had left for the
summer. I was upset to discover that it had tracking
problems which rendered it unwatchable.

I called Lee-Hi over the summer; the woman with
whom I spoke told me that lwould be able to return the
video when I came back to Lexington in September.
On Monday, I returned to Lee-Hi and talked to the
manager about returning the video. I showed her my
credit card statement from May, which shows a$39.84
purchase at Lee-Hi.

To my surprise, the manager, Bonnie, told me that
the video did not come from Lee-Hi. She spe-
cifically stated that she did not remember sell-
ing this particular video, double-cassette videos
or previously-viewed videos.

Bonnie read a couple of stickers on the video,
which state that the video is “Property of Mini Marts
Foods, Inc.” She said that video must be a rental from
a Mini Mart and suggested I return it there.

When I mentioned that two of my friends could
corroborate my story, she only repeated that the video
did not come from Lee-Hi.

The stickers were on the video in its original
wrapping when I purchased it. I do not know of any
Mini Mart in or around Lexington. I called to ask
where the 502 area code number listed for Mini Mart
Foods was, and the operator told me that 502 covers
Kentucky. To the best of my knowledge, I have never
been to Kentucky.

It bothers me that I received this response when I
attempted to return the video. W&L’s Honor System
is well-known in the local area. Up until this incident,
I thought Lexington-area merchants generally re-
spected the Honor System.

I also thought that an establishment which does"

good business with W&L students would be willingto
take my word and that of my two friends, both of
whom independently remembered me purchasing the
specific movie title at Lee-Hi.

Apparently, I was wrong.

The worst part is that other businesses show the
same disregard for the Honor System. A friend of
mine recently went to The Bookery and was told that
she would have to leave her book bag at the door—
their attempt to prevent shoplifting. She tells me that
it did not used to be that way.

I am sure others have had similar experiences. I
guess we’ve all found out that the boundaries of the
Honor System are much more narrow than we might
have assumed.

Gifted kids need
attention as well

Recently, my psychology profes-
sor informed my classmates and.I of
our semester project. We were pre-

sented many choices: write a paper,
work in a day—care, help at a date-
rape hotline or tutor children.
Tutors are needed at the local el-
ementary schools——in fact, these
places are desperate.

Icouldn’thelpbutthinkto myself:
“Ifthere are that many kids who need
help in school, there must also be a lot
of gifted students who need attention
as well.” If the schools around here
are anything like my elementary
school, gifted children needjust as
much help, if not more, than the
slower kids.

Education for gifted and talented
students has become passé. Hun-
dreds of children every year sit bored
and unchallenged in classrooms,
barely heeded attention by theirteach-
ers and offered only faint praise. The
gifted and talented kids are among
the shining stars of our future, those
who will be the inventors, rocket sci-
entists and world leaders. Unfortu-
nately, with little intellectual chal-
lenge, they often become resigned.
They fail to try as a result of wasted
time in classrooms and easy as-
signments.

Because of the range of intelli-
gence among students, sometimes the
gifted children end up teaching those
who are slower than themselves. Of-
ten, after finishing an easy assign-
ment, these kids sit idle with nothing
to do. Their teachers, who are over-
whelmed with having to assist so
many of their students at once, often
send off the gifted children to help
their classmates.

This is wrong. Bright students are
not in school to teach their peers;
rather, they are there to be taught.
These unchallenged kids should re-

ceive work at their level which they ,
can ponder and from which they can 

learn.
Some elementary schools have

or that these children don’t have _

Some parents and administrators :
are concerned that gifted programs -I

will place these students on a higher

level and make the other average and —‘
below-average kids suffer from low 
self—esteem. This is no excuse. ._
School was not created to make ,
students “feel good.” It is an en— v

vironment for learning.
Often, though, money is simply

not available for a gifted-and-talented 2

program.
No one knows ifthis situation will

redeem itself. Concerned teachers ‘
have been trying for years to get more 3
money and to create better programs 
for the gifted; the only result, in most ,

cases, has been more cutbacks.

A few years ago, I spoke at length 

with a gifted-and-talented teacher at
our local junior high school about re-

cent changes and cutbacks in the pro- ,'
gram. As we departed, she sadly said, 
“After awhile, you’ll realize that noth— ‘
ing will change, no matter how hard ‘-
you try.” Her classes, cut a year before A

from daily to twice a week, had just ;
been cut again to one day per week.

1 hope that we can overcome this "

pessimistic attitude and improve the

gifted-and-talented programs. Perhaps Vi

our psychology class should send stu-

dents to work with the bright and ig- "
nored. Schools need to suit all stu- ‘

dents——especially the ones who will '
lead our world in twenty years.

Dear Torn,

Your dilemma reminds me of
that obnoxious Top 40 song “I

are in a difficult situation we have
all been in before. _

The first step to reconciliation
with your friend is realizing your
behavior was less than admirable.

plunge with Mr. X.‘

What?! You’ve already been to
one and you still don’t know what’s
going on? Why W&L accepts
clueless northerners like yourself is
beyond me. Well, to be honest, I’m
a Northerner too, so here are my five
tips to help you achieve proper tail-
gating attire:

For boys, as usual it’s a no-
brainer. Always go with the uni-
form, i.e. wrinkled khakis, navy
blazer and that tie you ’ve been wear-
ing since day one. (Dirty white hat is
optional for tailgating.)

For girls, black is always an easy
option. However, if you prefer to
leave your funeral attire in the closet,

then:

Go with a colored, fashion-con-
scioussuit; this does not mean you
should raid your mother’s closet.
Have fun — go wild. This is one of
the few occasions where trendy-chic
is in.

Always carry a plastic cup in
hand, even if it only contains O.J.
No one will know you’re not cool.

Finally, no tailgating ensemble
is complete without a pair of expen-
sive-looki_ng sunglasses. NOTE:
Ms. Etiquette said expensive-l0ok-
ing. If you do not own such a pair,
the $5 blue-light specials at KMart
will suffice.

come to terms with reality. You
can’t steal what she never had.
Who knows, maybe someday
she’ll stab you in the back too.

But give her some time to real-
ize there are other khakis on the
Hill. And before you know it, the
two of you will be happily shop-
ping together for Homecoming
dresses.

P.S. What were you girlsthink-
ing? As If any Washington and
Lee boy is attractive enough to
make him worth fighting over.
Let those good ’ole Southern boys
fight over you.

Andrea, fooled by Ms. Etiquette’s
recommendation, had ordered
spaghetti with meatballs. Although
plentiful in portion, the entree fell
short of the II Palazzo standard.

The accompanying bread was

soggy on the bottom. Already full

take most of the spaghetti with her in

ALEX CHRISIENSEN .9
H11 MOVIE CRrric A I I I I
I was trying to delineate the differ— a
ence between Robert Zemeckis’s last CONTAL, T

two films to see what makes a great
movie and how that’s different from a
movie that comes very close, but just
doesn’t hit a real home run. “Forrest
Gump” is the movie that made it to

great; “Contact” is the one that just didn’t quite. “Contact” is still quite
entertaining, but somehow it just didn’t reach that plateau which made me bring
literally everyone I know to see “Forrest Gump,” one at a time, until I knew the
movie by heart.

What I have concluded is that a great movie is so idiosyncratic and unique
that it is literally impossible to think, ‘‘It was good, but they just needed the right
(writer, lead actor, director.)” You simply can’t imagine any of these three basic
factors beingchanged and still having a good film. Nobody ever said, “Gee, that
‘Forrest Gump’ really would have been something if Kevin Costner had been
Forrest,” or “if Spielberg could have gotten his hands on it.” It needed Tom
Hanks, Zemeckis, and writer Eric Roth. That’s what made it, and that’s also
why they all have Oscars on their mantels right now.

Jodie Foster may have another Oscaron her mantel come March, but it’s
difficult to imagine that Zemeckis will be in contention again or that writers
James V. Hart and Michael Goldenberg will need to rent a tux.

I know it might seem mean, or unrealistic I guess is a good word, to expect
Robert Zemeckis to hit it out of the park every time, but I really am interested
in the slight differences that distinguish the good from the great. I think the

***i of4

    

answer, in this case, is that the project just didn’t need Robert Zemeckis. It
needed him to get made in the first place, but it didn’t need his particular vision
to make it compelling. There may or may not have been someone out there who
could have made “Contact” great, but almost any working director could have
made it just as watchable. Nothing lifts “Contact” above the crowd and says,
“Contact! This is what it is.”

“Contact.” as you probably have heard by now, is the story of Ellie Arroway,
an astronomer obsessed with finding intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.
She runs a program which tries to identify patterns in the radio transmissions
constantly arriving from deep space which might distinguish intelligent trans-
missions from the noise that stars make. Despite cuts in funding and being
looked down upon by the rest of the scientific community, Arroway battles on,
obsessed by her need to reach out. Her best efforts aside, however, Arroway’s
funding is about to be cut when she suddenly finds what she’s been waiting for:
a pattern among the noise.

As David Letterman said, “The aliens faxed down the plans for a spaceship.”
Suddenly, Ellie Arroway isn’t just that crazy chick who looks for aliens, she’s
that brilliant visionary who found the aliens. The next big question, obviously,
is who’s going to ﬂy the mother. I don’t want to ruin the expertly crafted
suspense, but I will say that the obstacles to Ellie’s selection are among the best
things about the film. “

Contact” sets the stakes extraordinarily high and generally pays off in the
end. There are some truly unsatisfying things about the pay-off as well, but you
have to admire whoever had the guts to bring the plot of the film so far to the
brink.

Jodie Foster does a good job as Arroway, despite the character’s stupid
name. Every time Matthew McConnaughey said, “Ellie,” I cringed. It just
sounds dumb. Nevertheless, Foster’s full intensity is on display, and you have
to like her and admire her character’s resourcefulness and determination. One
thing though: Forget the hats, Jodie. Really, darling, they’re too much. You
look like a refugee, and refugee chic is so over.

The ending is a huge surprise, and a lot of people felt let down by it, myself
included. And yet, following the very valid thoughts ofthe film through to their
conclusions, there really couldn’t be another ending. Any alterations would
knock over the ideological house of cards. Maybe that’s the problem with the
film. It knows itself so well, it leaves barely any room for heart.
