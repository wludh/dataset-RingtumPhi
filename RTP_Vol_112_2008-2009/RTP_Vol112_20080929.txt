The future

diplomacy
Morella on expectations of
next administration

By Brooke Sutherland
STA FF W R IT E R

Ambassador Constance Morella took the
stage in Lee Chapel Wednesday night to speak
about “Global Expectations for the Next Admin-
istration” in the inaugural address of the Francis
McNulty Logan Lewis annual lecture series.

Morella was a ﬁtting choice for the lecture,
which is sponsored by the George C. Marshall
foundation: Morella served as the U.S. represen-
tative for the eighth district of Maryland for 16
years and was Permanent Representative to the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development for four years in Paris. .

“As a United States representative in the
OECD, Ambassador Morella is a testimony to
George C. Marshall and the Marshall program,”
said politics Professor William Connelly. “I be-
lieve her remarks were very timely, especially in
light of the current ﬁnancial crisis.”

“I think [the lecture] was a great opportunity
for Washington and Lee University students and
faculty alike to learn firsthand about the global-
ization of politics and economics, “ he said.

Turnout at the event was low, despite the no-

“Ambassador Morella is a tes-
timony to George C. Marshall
and the Marshall program...I

believe her remarks were very

timely, especially in light of the

}

current ﬁnancial crisis. ’

Wllllam Connelly, Professor of Polltics

table relevance of Morella’s speech to today’s
electoral climate.

“I felt like too few took advantage of the
opportunity to learn from someone with direct
practical experience on globalization,” Connelly
said.

Drawing from her extensive experience in
both national and international politics, Mo-
rella stressed to the audience the “need to re-
store [America’s] leadership in the free world”
through cooperation with international trends
and by’ setting an example for developing and
developed nations alike.

Morella stressed that perceptions about the
United States as a world superpower are chang-
ing and that “sentiment about America has dra-
matically declined.” She highlighted six areas
of concentration where the United States could
improve its leadership: energy supply and envi-
ronmental protection, trade, immigration, edu-
cation, research and scientiﬁc innovation, and
the economy.

Morella called upon the next leader of the
United States to take initiative in these areas.
She stressed the need to act to “change the way
we use energy and spread technology” in or-
der to become more environmentally efﬁcient,
to move past growing attitudes of isolationism
and protectionism towardsmore expansive free
trade and bilateral treaties, and to create a more
effective immigration policy.

‘Morella speciﬁcally called upon the future ad-
ministration to rethink immigration policies that
prevent educated foreign scholars from gaining
the visas they need to study in the United States
and adamantly urged America’s next leader to
pursue recruitment and retention of engineers, a
career that has seen a steady decline in profes-
sionals. I

DUls

on the

rise

SJ C chastises students after four DUIs reported I

By Allison Chopin
MANAGING EDITOR

Despite the availability of extensive
transportation services for students who
choose to drink, police have reported four
DUI charges among Washington and Lee
students so far this year.

This number was cited by Brandon Dot-
son, Associate Dean of Students, who re-
ceived reports from the Lexington, County,
and State Police.

“Clearly, some students are making
poor decisions,” Dotson said in an e-mail.
“This level [of] behavior is not consistent

.with the standards of the Washington and
Lee University community.”

According to Director of Public Safety
Mike Young, this number is not necessar-
ily a major increase compared to previous
years. In the ﬁrst month of the 2007-2008
school year, two DUIs were reported.

But Dotson holds that students" and

“There s nothing you can say
to justiﬁz it...It is unbelievable
that no one in recent years

has been killed or maimed ” .

Chrls Tutor, SJC Secretary

administration still‘ have reason to be
alarmed.

“Anytime that the number that is greater
than zero, I cannot say this year is any bet-
ter than previous years,” he said.

A DUI or other violation of a Virginia
State Alcohol and Drug Law in Rockbridge
County also violates the university’s Initia-
tives on Alcohol and Other Drugs, as ex-
plained in the student handbook.

The Student Judicial Council (SJC) is

currently working to process these viola-
tions and issue proper sanctions. According
to the handbook, sanctions can vary from
ﬁnes and mandatory “education and coun-
seling” up to suspension or dismissal from
the university.

SJC Chairrnain Riley Barnes explained
that the handbook includes suggested sanc-
tions, but the council makes decisions on a
case-by-case basis, and sanctions can vary
based on circumstances.

Some circumstances, however, leave lit-
tle room for negotiation. Barnes explained
that a DUI with a Blood Alcohol Content
(BAC) of .15 or greater automatically mer-
its suspension from the university.

SJC Secretary Chris Tutor noted that
one student has been suspended this year,
and others have received “sizeable amounts
of community service.”

Wall Street scare rocks W&L investments

Williams Investment Society rides shaky market, looks for opportunities

Bylames Dick
STAFF WRITER

The recent economic woes on
Wall Strect—including the buyout
and bankruptcy of some of the largest
investment banks-—has made some
students in the Williams School of
Commerce, Economics and Politics

more concerned than usual about the ~

performance of the stock market.

Since January the Williams Invest-
ment Society (WIS), a student gr ‘ p
that manages about $1.5 million of
Washington and Lee’s endowment,
has lost 15 percent or approximately
$225,000 of their investments. WIS
manages less than 1% of the school’s
Endowment.

No one questions that playing the

‘stock market is a dangerous game,

and for WIS participants, it is also a
learning experience. While the loss
of several hundred thousand dollars
has dampened spirits, the investment
society is determined to get it back.

As WIS’ executive director An-
drew Sims said, losses are to be
expected when you take the risk of
investing in stocks. Stocks can be
unstable if not volatile, and in the

"A lot of what we ’ve
seen in the market re-
cently has been driven
by fear——some legitimate

and some not. ”

Andrew Sims, Executlve Dlrector
of Wllllams Investment Soclety

current economic climate anyone
with stock runs the risk of losing.
Sims considers the investment soci-
ety’s recent losses to be “systematic
setbacks.”

One of the investment societies’
strategies will be to invest in com-
panies with unique products and low
stock prices. The theory proposes
that if a company has been underval-
ued, the market will correct itself and
the value of the stock will rise.

Sims said the investment society
is in a position to make proﬁts while
fear of volatile stock prices pervades
the market. “A lot of what we’ve
seen in the market recently has been
driven by fear—some legitimate and
some not,” he said.

Prof. Dennis Garvis, department
head of business administration and
advisor to the Williams Investment
Society, suggested that many of the
problems in the stock market today
reﬂect poor business models and an
overreliance on borrowed money.

“If a company that needs to bor-
row money can’t borrow money at a
good rate, it’ll have serious issues,”
he said.

On other hand, companies with

sound business models such as Mi-
crosoft are still doing well, Garvis
said. The software company recently
announced it would buy back a por-
tion of it’s own shares, taking those
shares out of the stock market and
making the leftover shares more
valuable.

Garvis feels that if companies like
Microsoft can afford to buy their own
shares, they are probably wealthy
enough to keep their operations going
at a steady pace. Companies with the
ﬁnancial strength of Microsoft “keep
producing, no matter what happens
in New York and on Wall Street,”
making them a sound investment, he
said.

Sims said he is excited about the
prospect of buying stock in sound, if
undervalued, companies while fear is
still keeping share prices low. Sims
is conﬁdent in the investment soci-
ety’s ability to make money despite
the economy’s uncertain future.

ampus Sustainability Week '

University uses music, lectures and local food to promote sustainability at W&L

By Llzz Dye
STAFF WRITER

In promotion of Washing-
ton and Lee’s recent efforts to
become more environmentally
friendly, “Campus Sustainabil-
ity Week” has kicked off with
events and activities that strive to
support environmental sustain-
ability at W&L and in the greater
Rockbridge community.

The Adrienne Young Band
began the week with a concert in
the Cohen Amphitheater near the
Commons on Sunday.

Adrienne Young is a Spot-
sylvania, Virginia-based singer,
songwriter, and founder of Ad-
dieBell Records, a production
company. Young has given inter-
views on NPR, been nominated
by the International Bluegrass
Music Association as Emerging

Artist of the Year, and toured
throughout the U.S. and Eng-
land.

She is also a spokeswoman
for Food Routes Network, a Web
site that aids organizations in re-
building local, community-based
food relationships. It aims to in-
crease capacity to design, launch
and implement successful “buy
local” food campaigns across the
country.

Monday is “Water Aware-
ness Day,” on which professors
Humston, Carey and Harbor will
speak on water-related issues of
their interest or specialty. Prof.
Carey will discuss glaciers, a
subject he will focus on during a
one-year study of glacial melting‘
in South America. Prof. Harbor
will discuss the cleanliness of the
Maury River.

Prof. Humston will speak on
what the Chesapeake Bay was
like before the emergence of
environmental awareness, the is-
sues confronting the Bay today

tied together. If we can make 10-
cal changes, then we can have
broader impacts on places such
as the Chesapeake Bay.”

Community Service Day.” The
Blue Bike Program at W&L will
be prominently featured. The
bike loan program will provide a
free clean form of transportation

for W&L community members.

“The Blue Bike Program
gives students other options for
travel and its aim is to get peo-
ple excited about biking,” said
W&L’s Environmental Manage-
ment Coordinator Chris Wise. “If
peopleuse bikes instead of cars,
the University will save a lot of
money and there will be less air
pollution.”

Wednesday is “Local Food
Stewardship Day.” The Local
Harvest Dinner in the dining hall
will include food from various
farms and vendors in Rockbridge
country, including the Shenan-
doah Produce Auction, Sweet
Treats Bakery and Papa Weaver
Farm.

Marketplace Manager Don
Kendall said, “The university
supports local farmers, which

says a lot about the university’s
commitment to the community
and sustainability.”

Other features of interest in-
clude the W&L garden, which
the biology department started
last year to incorporate fresh-
grown produce and herbs into
the students’ food. The garden
also contributes produce to the
Campus Kitchens Project.

“By growing our own vegeta-
bles, we are not wasting money
on canned food,” said junior
Rosemary Kelley who volun-
teers in the garden.

Campus Sustainability Week
will be an opportunity for W&L
students to learn about altema-
tive environmental practices that
can result in cleaner and greener
communities.

Rockbridge Report
wins award

Student production gains national recognition
for the second time in the three years

By Barbara Knlpp
STAFF WRITER

The Rockbridge Report, a
multimedia news website pro-
duced by Washington and Lee
University journalism students,
was nationally recognized for its
production of local news by the
Society of Professional Joumal—
ists this past April.

This is the second time in the
last three years that the Rock-
bridge Report has received top
recognition in the “Stand alone
onlinei category” at the SPJ re-
gional conference '

This is no small feat, as the
W&L production is competing
with large programs from other
major universities such as Ari-

‘ zona State University and North-

western University.

Professor Brian Richardson,
head of the journalism depart-
ment, said that it was “the out-
standing students and faculty that
made the difference” in produc-

ing the Rockbridge Report.

The Rockbridge Report is
a converged, multimedia news
website that produces the news
of Rockbridge County through
print, broadcast and interactive
media. It is the only TV news
station that is broadcast from
Rockbridge Country.

While the Rockbridge Report
has been at W&L for years, it was
just in the past six years that the
project became the converged
news program that it is today.

The project involves students
of the higher—level journalism
classes who work together with
faculty members to report on the
local news of Rockbridge Coun-
ty.

Richardson said he has been
involved in the newscast for
years, particularly in the last
year. He said he enjoys working
closely with the students, who
are largely responsible for run-
ning the project.

The students are in charge of
reporting, interviewing, writing,
compiling, editing and docu-
menting each aspect of the Rock-
bridge Report. On the third ﬂoor
of Reid Hall, groups of journal-
ism students can be found work-
ing together on this and other
projects.

Caroline Davis, a junior, said
she enjoys her time in the lab
working on the Rockbridge Re-
port because of “the great chem-
istry among co-workers” and the
“close-knit” bonds formed while
compiling the Report.

While students do much of the
work, faculty members oversee
the project and work closely with
the students.

Students who participate gain
real-world experience in writing
and editing, while also learning
the technologies of broadcasting,
podcasting, and creating web-
sites.

of community service.”

“We just want to remind people that adult
choices mean adult consequences,” he said.

Barnes pointed out other severe consequences
that can result from a DUI charge. “It will be with
you throughout your life,” he said. “It can be a ca-
reer-ruining experience.”

Tutor echoed Barnes and Dotson’s sentiments
in declaring that these incidents are unacceptable
by university standards.

‘‘It is a breach of the community’s trust to drive
drunk,” Tutor said. ‘‘There’s nothing you can say
to justify it."

“It is unbelievable that no one in recent years
has been killed or maimed,” he added.

The recent conduct incidents prompted Dotson
to advise Barnes and Tutor to send a campus-wide
e-mail reminding students of the seriousness of al-
cohol violations and the dangers posed to the com-
munity by these behaviors.

“The riskier the conduct, the more likely a ter-
rible tragedy could befall our community,” said
the e-mail. “The first several weeks of the year are
exciting and warrant celebration, but they do not
warrant the e remely dangerous behavior exhib-
ited by some.”

In addition to holding hearings and issuing
sanctions for conduct violations, the SJC has been
active in the “educational aspect” of encouraging
students to make healthy decisions, according to
Barnes. _

“Any decision to drink and drive when we have
resources here is a bad one,” Barnes said, citing
the availability of Traveller and other safe-ride op-
tions.

“Students that host social outings should be
sure to provide safe rides and understand that the
consequences for violating state and local alcohol
laws are severe,” said Dotson.

“Someone’s going to die if people don’t
change,” concluded Tutor.

Morella

continued from page 1

Her final call to America’s future leader
focused on the economy and the United
States’ role as “a crucible of conﬁdence in
global capitalism.” Morella emphasized the
need to generate both a short term struc-
tural ﬁx and a long term prevention plan for
the good of the global economy. I

Morella’s lecture made a strong impres-
sion on many attendants.

“I really enjoyed it,” said senior Rebec-
ca Taylor. “I thought [her topic] was really
relevant. The characteristics the world is
looking for in the next American leader are
very important to the election. The world
is waiting to see what direction the next
president will take us.”

Added ﬁrst-year Hannah Deming, “I
thought it was really interesting how up-
front she was about the international view
of America. It really stood out when she
talked about France, which most people
see as a developed nation, and having such
high security [as an American ambassador].
I thought that example pointed out what’s
wrong with international relations.”

Ambassador Morella wrapped up her
stay in Lexington with two lectures at VMI
for the Women in Leadership Luncheon
and a Seminar on International Relations
and a special visit to Professor Connelly’s
Politics 100, American National Govem-
ment class.

F ofrget the economy, says Abel Delgado, this election is still about the Iraq War

By  Delgado
COLUMNIST

The ﬁrst presidential debate
made it clear that the choice in
this election comes down to one
of two bracelets.

During the debate, Senator
McCain told the story of how
fallen soldier Matthew Stanley’s
mother asked him to wear her
son’s bracelet, making him prom-
ise that, “You’ll do everything in
your power to make sure that my
son’s death was not in vain.”

This is at the heart of why
Senator McCain supported the
surge.

Senator Obama also wears a
bracelet, that of fallen Sergeant
Ryan David Jopek, given to him
by a mother with a different mes-
sage. She wanted the Senator to
“make sure another mother is not
going through what I’m going
through.”

This is at the heart of why
Senator Obama opposed the

surge.
Few people, not I, not Senator
McCain, and not Senator Obama,

can understand the grief these _

two women have experienced.

Even when it is a result of a
war, burying one’s child must
be so unnaturally painful that no
grief we’ve ever experienced can
compare. But the grief led the
women to come to two complete-
ly different conclusions, and now
the country must choose one.

This is not just about who
was right and who was wrong
about Iraq.

I believe both men made their
decisions based on principles
and not on politics.

McCain supported the surge
even when it could have cost
him the presidency, because he
believed winning the war was
the right thing for America.

Obama, even after admit-
ting the surge succeeded, says
he would still oppose the surge

because it wasn’t about succeed-
ing to him. It was about stopping
bloodshed.

This the fundamental differ-
ence in philosophy that should
determine the election.

Voters have good reason to

cal perspective between McCain
and Obama encompasses Iraq,
the economy and every other is-
sue.

The question here is not about
supporting the surge or $700 bil-
lion bailouts.

Voters have good reason to say the economy

is the most important issue, but our economy

will be in tough shape regardless of who gets

elected Presidents get too much credit.

say the economy is the most im-
portant issue but our economy
will be in tough shape regardless
of who gets elected. Presidents
get too much credit when the
economy is good and too much
blame when the economy is bad.

The difference in philosophi-

The question is what beliefs
should be behind the choices we
make.

If you believe that America
has fallen, that we are losing
but have not lost quite yet, that
we should cut our losses, accept
defeat and call it a day, then you

should vote for Senator Obama.

If you believe that tough
times mean there is something
fundamentally wrong with our
nation, and that the wars we ﬁght
for our freedom and the freedom
of others should stop because
people will die, then you should
vote for Senator Obama.

If you believe that our capital-
ist economy should be complete-
ly reconﬁgured because the gov-
ernment can do a better job, or
that cost of defending principles
of free people and free markets is
too high in terms of lives or wage
differences, then you should vote
for Senator Obama.

But if you believe a fallen
America needs to stand up, and
if you believe it is not our prin-
ciples that have failed us but our
leaders, then you should vote for
Senator McCain.

If you believe that an America
that cuts its losses can never win,
and that America should always

win, you should vote for Senator
McCain.

If you believe that free people
and free" markets’ when led by an
effective and reformed govem-
ment will ultimately lead to less
bloodshed and greater wealth
for all, then you should vote for

‘Senator McCain.

If you are prepared to go
through the tough times that we
face regardless of who gets elect-
ed president, if you can stomach
the tough ﬁght we have ahead to
make sure that all those soldiers
who died protecting America’s
principles did not die in vain,
then your vote will go to John
McCain- Mine will.

This is about two bracelets
that represent honor and sacri-
ﬁce, but one that represents that
our sacriﬁces‘ are far from over
and our leader should be honor-

‘able enough to make them.

No trays, no justice

Scott Graham Centorino wants to know why we can ’t have dinner trays anymore

By Scott Graham Centorino
COLU MNIST

As we all know by now, our
beloved dining hall has decided
to remove trays from its menu in
the name of ‘sustainability.’

What does that even mean,
sustainability?

Now, I have a high school di-
ploma, have taken a couple sci-
ence courses in my day, and con-
sider myself a mildly intelligent
person. Never has ‘sustainabil-
ity’ ever been used as an excuse
to change something before.

When you sustain something,
you keep it the same. So, where
are the_ trays?

I understand this initiative’s
purpose. I get it. Over the years,
I have attained some notoriety as
one who will enjoy a wholesome
environmental green-fest. I’m all
for it. However, I am also for jus-
tice and civil liberty. Let’s face
it — the United States of America
would. not be where it is today
without trays. From the Revo-
lution and Manifest Destiny to
the Gilded Age and Technol-
ogy Boom, trays and American
greatness have become interde-
pendent.

After all, could we even begin
to imagine Jim Bowie, William
Travis, and Davy Crockett jug-
gling their ﬁnal bullets through
the hallways of the Alamo on

bare plates? No. They had trays.
Trays of bullets. E

Real men carry their bullets
on trays.

When you’re in the operating
room, with your life hanging in
the balance, you don’t want to
glance to your left and see Dr.
Trayless cradling all his scalpels
and forceps between each ﬁnger.

No. You want to see your
doctor rocking a tray, working
his instruments one at a time.
Trays save lives.

In that operating room, you
don’t want to turn to the nurse
and hear, “Oh, don’t worry. The
hospital is starting a new initia-
tive for ‘sustainability’.” You
would undoubtedly say, “Hey,
how about sustaining my life?”
Life or sustainability? Hmmm
- tough question made even
tougher by my complete lack of
knowledge as to what ‘sustain-
ability’ means.

Shall we analyze the stated
reasons for this shift in culinary
vision?

Actually, you have no choice.
Signs appearing in the dining
hall list ﬁve major reasons for
going “Tray-less.”

First of all, the sign itself is
anti-American. Who puts up
signs just declaring decisions in
which you had no say? It might
as well say — ‘Hey piggies- we’re

doing this, and you can’t do any-
thing about it because we made
the decision in a dark, backroom
without your meaningless opin-
ion. Shut up and take it.’ A i C N l

The last time Americans
saw such oppressive posters,
they were English colonists and
they had a King. His name was
George. The Third.

The sign begins, “The Mar-

vices on the evening of the 30”‘.
It suggests an anti-sustainability
regime has been subverted by
administrative mercenaries via

V regicidelbelfore propping uplthis

false, pro-sustainability puppet.
The next time you are in the
D-Hall, look into the eyes of our
friends behind the food. In their
eyes, you will see the dangerous
sublimity of cautious waiting.

The sign begins, “The Marketplace is going

T ray-Less! ” I ’m not making this up. What

kind of audacity is required to end such a

sentence with an exclamation point?

ketplace is going Tray-less!” I’m
not making this up. What kind of
audacity is required to end such
a sentence with an exclamation
point?

Humans should never be sub-
jected to such things.

It continues, in a very cheery
font, “Beginning Sunday, Au-
gust 31, 2008 Washington and
Lee Dining Services supports
sustainability.”

This implies that there must
have been some kind of planned
coup d’état within Dining Ser-

They hate sustainability, because
people hate things they don’t un-
derstand. I don’t understand sus-
tainability, therefore I hate it.

You also may ‘notice a subtle
but visual hint of their quiet but
ﬁrm insubordination. What do
the workers use to serve their
food? Trays. That’s right - dirty,
costly, anti-sustainability trays.

They are communicating
with us.

They are with us.

All we have to do is listen,
wait, and stand ready.

The poster continues with
“The simple act of going tray-
less will: minimize food waste,

reduce the release of chemicals
into the environment, reduce
costs, support the University’s
enviromnental sustainability ini-
tiatives.”

Whoa.

Hold the phone — ﬁve whole
reasons we should sacriﬁce
our freedom? You could have
stopped at four and had me.

Whichever puppet govem-
ment bureaucrat wrote this poster
has obviously never tried to carry
two plates of tater—tots, Chilean
sea bass, a glass of sweet tea, an
appetizer salad, a lemon for the
tea, and four plates of angel food
cake - at least not without a ‘tray.

If he had, he would never de-
scribe it as a “simple act.”

Food waste?'Maybe.

Water and energy usage? I’ll
buy it. ,

Reduce the release of chemi-i
cals into the environment? Wait
a minute. What on earth were
these people up to back. there
when we had trays?

And reduce costs? When does
my tuition drop?

Finally, the real star attraction
of this checklist - supporting the
university’s environmental sus-
tainability initiatives.

Isn’t this that very initiative?
Even the sleaziest used car sales-
man would never try to pitch to a

your initiative to buy a car.”

. It then closes with the jolly,
“Please join us on the path to
sustainability!” Perhaps I missed
something, but I only see one
path - their path.

Well, thank you for the in-
vitation to your forced march!
Much appreciated; I’ll be sure to
attend.

I’ll tell you what path I will
take - I’ll follow Davy Crockett.
Huddled in the dark and musty

rooms of the Alamo, during the

most famous siege in American
history, surrounded by» thou-
sands of approaching Mexican
soldiers, the men of the Alamo
never could have imagined a
world where people would give
up such basic liberties as trays
without __a ﬁght.

Davy Crockett, I salute you.

Nobody ever cried, “Remem-
ber , the Sustainability ‘Initia-
tive!” ;

I believe in freedom. I believe
in traysf  I .

At least until someone actu-
ally explains just why they need
to disappear that is.

Thinkthe financial crisis doesn’t affect you? Think again.

It doesn ’t matter what your major is, you are going to be affected by the impending ﬁnancial meltdown. So pay attention!

By Jacob Geiger
COLU MNIST

Think the ﬁnancial crisis
doesn’t affect you? Think again

Unless you’re one of those
unlucky business majors in the
C-School who watched his Wall
Street job offer vanish into bank-
ruptcy ;last week, you may not
have paid much, attention to the
current ﬁnancial crisis.

Well, I’ve got bad news for
you. Whether you’re a ﬁrst-
year, senior, or faculty member,
and whether you work in the C-
School, Science Center or Wilson
Hall, this ﬁnancial crisis matters.

Congress is busily debating
a $700 billion bailout proposal
from Treasury Secretary Hemy
Paulson that would — in theory
— stabilize the ﬁnancial markets

and help keep faltering compa-
nies in business.

The plan calls for the govem-
ment to buy up mortgage-backed

'securities; these securities have

lost value in the past year as mil-
lions of Americans fell behind
on mortgage payments and lost
their houses to foreclosure. The
government hopes this will be a
short-term ﬁx that lets compa-
nies get these bad assets off their
books. In theory, the government
can then sell the assets back to
the companies a few years from
now.

How much is $700 billion?
Well, since the federal budget for
2008 is about,$3 trillion, the bail-
out represents about a 20 to 25
percent‘ increase in spending for
the government this year.

The problem, of course, is

that the federal government only
collected around $2.6 trillion in
taxes last year, far less than the
$2.9 trillion it was already plan-
ning to spend. With the cost of
the bailout, thatispending total is
now well over $3 trillion.

Deﬁcit spending is nothing
new to our government. Aside
from a few unusual periods, in-
cluding the tech boom of the
late-19905, the government has
run on deﬁcit spending since the
Great Depression.

But deﬁcit spending by the
federal government is kind of
like taking your credit card down
to Pumpkinseeds. If you run up
a big bill, you don’t have to pay
it all back right away, but you
do have to make regular interest
payments. Right now the govem-
ment is spending $460 billion a

year on interest payments. That’s
about 15 percent of the federal
budget for 2008.

The new bailout is going to
push the national debt up closer
to $10 trillion, meaning those
interest payments are only going
to get bigger. If we assume there
are about 300 million U.S. citi-
zens, that’s more than $33,000 of
debt for each of us.

Here’s the problem: At some
point, the rest of the world’s
going to be forced to stage a ﬁ-
nancial intervention. China, Sin-
gapore, Dubai and other nations
that keep loaning us money are
going to cut us off and tell us
we can’t have any more until we
ﬁgure out how to stop spending
more than we earn.

Who do you think is going
to pay up? Not the grandpas and

grandmas who run.Washington,
D.C. They’ll probably be dead
before this ﬁnancial intervention
takes place. Not our parents, who
will be heading off to retirement
in the next 15 years (assuming
their 401k plans recover from the
disastrous last few weeks).

Nope, we’ll be stuck paying
for our parents’ Social Security
and dealing with the colossal
debt we’ve been handed. Gee
mom and dad, thanks for all your
love and support and a crushing
federal debt!

I understand that the ﬁnancial
crisis is diﬁicult to understand.
Even a lot of people who’ve
made their careers in business
have had to learn a boatload of
new terms in the last few months.
How many people knew what a
subprime mortgage or a credit-

default swap was a year ago? (If
you did know, thanks a lot for not
warning us).

We’re less than six ‘weeks
away from a pivotal election.
Frankly, neither one of these
candidates looks particularly
well qualiﬁed to lead us out of
this mess. In fact, I’m not sure
anyone on Wall Street or Capitol
Hill can really be trusted to look
aﬁer the next generation. ’

Regardless of who wins on
Nov. 4, a new age is coming.
The days of borrowing obscene
amounts of money to pay for
immense federal government
programs have got to end. If we
don’t wake up and make Amer-
ica’s leaders stop selling the fu-
ture to pay for today, what sort of
country are we going to inherit?

Where have all the
good men gone?

Wherever you ’re hiding, its time to ask a girl out

By Gozl Egbuonu
COLUMNIST

As Homecoming is about to be upon us,
I thought it would be poignant to discuss
the unfortunate predicament that many
campus women ﬁnd themselves in: a Date-
less Homecoming weekend. ,

Being that this will be my ﬁrst dateless
Homecoming, I immediately found myself
in a frenzied panic that involved me going
out several nights this week in the hopes
that I would stumble on a possible date, but
sadly, I was highly unsuccessful.

Aﬁer my failure, I had a moment of re-
ﬂection that sort of went like this:

‘Why am I out trying to ﬁnd a date?
Shouldn’t someone be looking for me in-
stead? I am a ﬁne woman (thanks, Oprah)
and I deserve to be chased.’

And like that, I immediately knew what
was wrong. All of the good men on this
campus are missing. I have since put out
an Amber Alert for them, but have not re-
ceived any information or helpful leads.

But in all seriousness, where are you
guys? I know you are all out there, but I
have yet to see you unless you are already
with someone else and in that case, I am
very hurt.

Sure, many of you are probably think-
ing, ‘Well, maybe something is wrong with
you that is preventing you from getting as
much as a measly date to homecoming.’ I

Like you, I thought the same thing un-
til I went out into the world beyond Rock-
bridge County and realized that I am doing

pretty well. I am not morbidly obese and
forced to stay in a bed because I cannot
move. Nor do I suffer from a serious case
of bad body odor. Additionally, I lotion so I

when the mood strikes me. I also happen to
be one of the least awkward people on this
campus. Yes, I may shout loudly across the
BDG quad or blow my nose loudly in the
commons, but I take that all as a sign of just
how comfortable 1 am with myself.

Hey, guys like a conﬁdent woman (don’t
laugh, you know you do).

So, with that settled, the ball is in you
guys’ court. There are assortments of gor-
geous, outgoing, friendly, and beautiful
single women out there who remain date-
less and it is a shame.

Don’t let your friends tell you that you
are lame for asking a girl out to dinner

and go out there and ﬁnd a date. Believe
me, there are many girls dateless out there,
so do not succumb to that horrible inﬂic-
tion of thinking someone has already asked
her to be his date. Ask her if she has a date
and if she does, go on to the next girl.

I know that may sound awful, but tough.
You can’t have your cake and eat it too, so
let the guy go ﬁnd a date. I am a strong be-
liever in sisterhood and we sisters have to
be understanding in these situations.

Ultimately, if you are a single gal and
you still don’t have a date, just go out any-
ways, or ﬁnd your girls and have a girls’

letter to the editor

Spin cycle civility. It happens.

Sam Gilleran would like to thank the Laundry God/Goddess. They ’re nice, amen.

Someone folded my laundry. Twice.

I have no idea who did this. In fact,
I’m secretly hoping that this person will
continue to fold my laundry. This being
Washington and Lee, we have constant-
ly malfunctioning dryers, so I had to
re-run some clothes at 2 AM last night.
Needless to say, they haven’t been tak-
en out of the dryer yet, unless this kind
soul has already done it for me.

Allow me to explain my sudden exu-
berance for laundry.

It was about noon yesterday and I re-
alized that I had to do laundry. It should
have been done about a week earlier.
However, due to the stress of school,
attempting to get back into the routine
of writing papers, and my now—chronic
illness, I was more than content sim-
ply to deal with the ever-growing pile
of clothes later. Then I ran out of clean
clothes and realized that something had
to be done NOW.

So I trekked over to Woods Creek
West, carrying an overﬂowing basket
of laundry. I calmly placed my clothes
in the washers, put the quarters into the
slots, left the building, and promptly
forgot aboutmy clothes.

See, I had to go to the business of-
ﬁce, and I had to go the bank, and I had
to take a shower after PE, and I had to
eat lunch, and I had to ﬁnish reading

for my class that was in two hours. You
know how it is. The thought of laundry
did occur to me while I was supposed
to be thinking in class about why a
picture of southern Africa and the In-
dian Ocean was on the cover of Stanley
Lombardo’s translation of the Odyssey,
but alas! there was no time to walk all
the way back to Woods Creek, transfer

my phone. It was 8:30 PM. My clothes
had been sitting in the washers for eight
hours after their cycle was complete. Or
so I thought.

I left the Commons, where I was
attempting to slog through the history
of cow herding in East Africa, and I
walked over to Woods Creek West
Laundry Room. And there were my

my clothes from the washers to the dry-
ers, and make it to Lex Coffee by 3:45
to have an important conversation about
... procrastination, actually.

Then it was off to Chamber Sing-
ers. Then I had to start reading for class
the next day, a 200+ page book called
“Antecedents to Modern Rwanda.” 1
love my class on Rwanda, 1 really do,
but David Vaught and Steph Schafer
will attest to the fact that I was whin-
ing about this book all night. I looked at

knew they would be out of the washers.

clothes out onto the table and put your

just tried to correct my usage of “fresh-

However, my clothes were not dumped
onto the table. They were neatly folded
on top of the dryers. l was shocked,

frankly. So I put the clothes into the
dryers, did the quarters thing, and went
back to the Commons to ﬁnish the his-
tory of cow herding.

I made it through the book. It was
about 1:30 AM. My clothes had ‘been
ﬁnished and sitting in the dryers for
about 4 hours or so. Or so I thought.
I dragged myself back over to West,
wanting nothing more than to just dump
my clothes into the basket and fold them
later, the next morning.

BEHOLD!

My clothes — folded neatly on top of
the dryer. At least the ones that were dry
(stupid nonfunctioning dryers, waste of
a perfectly good dollar). I quit believing
in ﬁctional characters around the age of
eight, you know, Santa Claus, the Eas-
ter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy. However,
I have concluded that there is a Laun-
dry God/Goddess. Not only that, but
this Laundry Deity loves me and has a
wonderful plan for my life, which ap-
parently involves never having to fold
clothes ever again.

I was in such shock that I immedi-
ately gently placed my folded clothes
into the basket, dropped them off in my
room, walked back to the laundry room,
and placed a notice on the door. It read
something like:

“DEAR LAUNDRY GOD/GOD-

DESS: WILL YOU MARRY ME? {:1
YES El NO”

This anonymous offer of marriage
still holds. (Note: If you’re a laundry
god and not a goddess, I don’t swing
that way. I wasn’t thinking clearly at
that time of night. Sorry to disappoint.
But maybe we can bro out and play
Rock Band or something.)

This is all very humorous, at least
I think so, but there is an intelligible
point. During one of my study breaks
last night (read: gripe session about cow
herding), I read Gozi’s editorial about
the effect of the Greek system on the
Speaking Tradition. I found myself pi-
ously nodding in agreement with her in-
sight about this evil impact of our social
hierarchy. I was in complete agreement
with her assertion that neither Wash-
ington nor Lee “would be very happy
with such behavior.” Actually, I still am
in complete agreement with that state-

' ment.

However, I don’t think it’s quite as
bad as Gozi perceives. Kindness and
civility may indeed be somewhat un-
fashionable in our brave new world.
But somebody folded my clothes last
night. Twice.

Ashna Sharan and Anna Van Erven, two first-year contestants, show off their moves at the second annual Dance-a-thon

Dance-a-thon raises over $1,000, 21 students compete for full FD package

By sarah.Keckler
STAFF WRITER ,

The commons living room
played host to one of this year’s
longest dance parties: Phi Beta
Sigma and Pi Beta Phi’s Dance-
a-thon.

The event was themed “Danc-
ing Around the World” and ben-
eﬁted the March of Dimes and
Rockbridge County literacy pro-
grams, the philanthropy initia-
tives of the sponsoring fraternity
and sorority.

From Friday evening to the
earliest hours of Saturday mom-
ing, students from every class
were trying to stay on their toes
and dance to the sounds of music
from an array of different coun-

.tries. The last one dancing was

to be awarded a full Fancy Dress
package.

The second annual Dance-
a-thon was held in the Commons
living room with DJ (and alum)
David Graves. It began ofﬁcially
at 9:40 p.m. Friday night and
ended at around 4 a.m. Saturday
morning. Twenty-one students
registered to compete for the
grand prize. Many more students
came to dance without having to
abide by the stringent rules for
contestants.

Besides the FD package
grand prize, runners-up received
gift certiﬁcates from local busi-

nesses. Participants could also
win prizes in a raffle.

Jessie Wang, Vice President
of Philanthropy for Pi Beta Phi,
said she appreciated the support.
“I really want to thank all the
organizations who donated gift
certiﬁcates, and also a big thank-
you to all the contestants for sup-
porting our cause,” she said.

Wang noted that this year’s
contestants were more intense
than last year. “People came in
workout clothes and everything,”
she said. One contestant, ﬁrst-
year Jenny Pritchett, went on an
all-carb diet for a few days lead-
ing up to the competition.

Chris Rucker, president of
Phi Beta Sigma, explained that
this year’s Dance-a-thon includ-
ed new rules. The competition
involved trivia questions with
which, for each correct answer,
a contestant was awarded points,
which could help determine the
Winner in case of a tie. Partici-
pants also received break tickets
at the beginning of the dance,
which they could exchange for
break time or keep for points.

The main rule was simply to
not stop dancing.

Wang mentioned that this
year’s competition raised almost
twice as much as last year’s, de-

spite that fact that nearly the same
number of dancers registered.

“The raffle tickets and t-shirts
made the difference and so far
we’ve raised over $1,000,” Wang
said.

The t-shirts certainly received
a lot of raving reviews. Junior
Kim Holland said, “I love the
shirt design with different lan-
guages!”

Rucker joined Wang in thank-
ing student organizations such as
PAACE and GRC who helped
decorate and support the event.
“We’re going to try to make this
event bigger and better every
year,” he said.

6 Students dance the night away

 

KEVIN REMINGTON / for W&L

Sometime around, 4 a.m., se-
nior Shreya Durvasula and soph-
omore Becky Guynn tied for ﬁrst
place with three correct trivia
questions each and decided to
split the FD package rather than
compete in a dance-off.

Last year’s ﬁrst-place win-
ner, sophomore Hannah Kollef
showed up to dance and support
friends, but refused to register to
defend her title, “mostly because
I puked for four hours aﬁer it
ended last year,” she said.

Australian comedian performs in Stackhouse Theater

James Smith ’s hilarious performance was well received by the W&L community, GAB to bring in more comedians

By Mlchael Morella
STAFF WRITER

While the presidential elec-
tion is‘ making headlines for al-
most every news publication in
the country, it is making some-
thing quite different for come-
dian James Smith: punch lines.

The Australian-bom comic
spent a fair portion of his hour-
long set at Washington and Lee
on Tuesday focused on political
issues, particularly involving the
ongoing presidential race.

Before a crowd of several
dozen in Stackhouse Theater,
Smith parodied everything from
political activism among celebri-
ties to the issues of race and gen-
der that have come up through-
out the campaigns.

Smith added a trace of his
deadpan, dark humor to stan-
dard-fare standup comedy top-
ics — politics, dating, the Jonas
Brothers — and was met with
roars of laughter from those in

attendance.

“It was pretty much what I
had hoped for,” said senior Mor-
gan Harris, acting comedy chair
and Common Grounds chair for
General Activities Board (GAB).
Morgan introduced Smith at the
beginning of the night.

“There was actually some
intelligent humor,” Harris said.
“But that was just a small indi-
cation of things to come.”

Harris, who’s tried his hand
at standup at various events in
his time at W&L, has seen the
amount of money and interest
in standup comedy at W&L in-
crease dramatically over the past
four years.

“We get comedians right
before they blow up,” he said.
Smith’s performance marked
a premiere event in the GAB
Comedy Series for the 2008-
2009 school year. Harris says
the GAB’s goal is to bring in one
comedian each month.

While his material was fa-
miliar to many, Smith’s path
to comedy is most assuredly a
unique one. A graduate of Bond
University’s law school, one of

out high school and college, he
found no outlet for what he felt
was his innate desire to perform.

Smith was selected to de-
bate at the 1995 World Debating

“It was pretty much what I had hoped for...

But it was just a small indication of things

to come... We get comediens right before they

blow up”

Morgan Harrls, GAB comedy chalr
 

Australia’s most prestigious uni-
versities, Smith was a practicing
banking and ﬁnance lawyer in
Sydney before he entered into
the world of comedy.

“I was always the wise guy
[in school],” Smith explained in
a post-show interview. “I was
always the class clown.” After
participating in debate and pub-

versity and won the Australasian
Public Speaking Competition in
Melbourne that same year. After
college, Smith began performing
comedy at open mics as an outlet
for his urge to perform outside of
the courtroom.

While practicing law in Syd-
ney, Smith had an epiphany:
comedy seemed to him the only

thing he could do effortlessly.
Within two months of his debut,
Smith was dubbed “Comic of
the Year” at the Sydney Comedy
Festival, according to Comedy
Central.

Even with all his accolades,
Smith’s favorite part of comedy
is still the purity of the profes-
sion. He loves just having a con-
versation with the audience and
draws most of his material from
issues that he feels passionately
about, and hopes that the crowd
can laugh right along with him.

Now a regular in the New
York City comedy circuit, Smith
has made good ﬁiends with the
community of performers there,
and has been particularly inﬂu-
enced by popular comic Chris
Rock,

Inspired by his friend and
mentor, Smith is currently in
the process of writing an HBO
special he hopes will give him
greater exposure. He plans to

-devote the next 12 to 18 months

perfecting his material and de-
livery in comedy clubs all across
the country.

“You have to treat it like a
football season,” he said.

He also spoke highly of his
stop in Lexington, reminiscing
about his own undergraduate ex-
perience in Australia and com-
plimenting his listeners’ intellect
and welcoming environment.

Perhaps Smith’s sincerest
form of ﬂattery during his per-
formance was in his parody of
the W&L community itself.
From jokes about Ralph Lauren
in the bookstore and sorority row
looming like the palaces of Bev-
erley Hills, Smith sarcastically
found comfort in the ﬁner things
that the hard work and intellect
of W&L students has afforded.

Scholar addresses free thought ~

Rebecca Lilly discusses creative ideas in “Freedom from habitual perception ”

By Valaree Tang
s r A F F w R IT E R

The Washington and Lee com-
munity seems to want some new
ideas. With the upcoming elec-
tion and controversy regarding
some of the school’s new poli-
cies and “phraseology”, an origi-
nal thought or opinion would be
welcome. But it seems that there
may be something blocking an
inﬂux of creative thinking. In her
lecture, Rebecca Lilly presented
her theories about what prevents
innovative thought.

Lilly, a poet, philosopher and
thinker, presented her ideas at the
2008 Root Lecture on September
23 in a lecture entitled “Freedom
from Habitual Perception”. Held
in Huntley Hall, the lecture was
free and open to the public.

Lilly presented the differenc-
es between the mind and aware-
ness. She held that the mind is
“mental software” whose “basic
mechanism is identiﬁcation”.
Awareness, on the other hand,
is non-dual unconditioned “pure
potential” that is non-resisting
and “goes with the ﬂow”. Real-
izing the distinction between the

two helps us to think, as the cli-
che’ goes, outside the box.

Lilly asserted that life apart
from habitual perception allows
for humans to have “original
or creative ideas and solutions,
compassion or unconditional
love, and inner objectivity...”

She then claimed that the
mind is the origin of condi-
tioned and negative emotions,
while awareness is “the source
of unconditioned well-being
or happiness and (conditioned)
positive emotions, which result
from identiﬁcation,” wrote Lilly
in her lecture handout. Identiﬁ-
cation causes emotional reactiv-
ity. In order to rid ourselves of
the negative emotions put forth
by the mind, we must disassoci-
ate ourselves from our mind and
allow awareness to control our
thoughts in a process she called
disidentiﬁcation.

Lilly asserted that “aware-
ness removes us from this un-
conscious personalized relation-
ship with everything, and affords
self-understanding, and an ob-
jective view” which will, in turn,
prevent the experience of nega-
tive emotions.

The Triumphant return
of The Walkmen

Will Mays reviews the new album
released by the indie rock band

By Will Mays
sun WRITER

When faced with the ques-
tion, “Hey, have you heard the
new Walkmen album?” many
of W&L’s students revealed that
not only had they not heard the
album, but few had even heard
of the band at all.

While the community might
not yet be acquainted with the
band, the group’s album may
make its mark on this year’s mu-
sic scene. The Wa1kmen’s most
recent effort, You & Me, released

albums, and the overall result is
more mature songwriting.
That’s not to say You & Me
is without its fair share of fun
though. Such standouts as “In the
New Year” and “Postcards from
Tiny Islands” each roar with en-
ergy the band rarely displayed in
the past, and the softer tunes fea-
ture subtle strings and horns that
lead to a more ﬁlled—out sound
from the band. The Walkmen
may have not innovated much
in their songwriting department,
but what changes were made are

last month, is easily one of this
year’s best forays into indie
rock. “It’s good. I really like it,”
senior Morgan Harris said.

You & Me marks the New
York quintet’s ﬁrst album of
original material since 2006’s
sonic departure, A Hundred Miles
Oﬁ‘. Unlike the Latin-inﬂuenced
Miles, though, You & Me ﬁnds
the band returning, yet expand-
ing upon the sound of their ear-
lier work. The guitars jangle in
their clean tones and the upright
piano and organ sound straight
out of vintage American guitar
rock. 4

The album’s opener, “Donde
Esta la Playa” whirs to life with
somber bass, drums, and organ.
The listener is immediately im-
mersed into lead singer Ham-
ilton Leithauser’s tale of life
after parties. The album takes a
more cynical tone towards the
late-night lifestyle than previous

both noticeable and add new-
found depth to their sound.

While You & Me is on the
whole excellent, the album does
have a misstep here and there.
The ﬁrst half of the album is
exceptionally strong, yet the
second half meanders to a de-
gree, and the songs are notice-
ably less memorable. That being
said though, “In the New Year”
stands not only as one of The
Walkmen’s best songs to date,
but also one of the best songs
released in 2008.

You & Me’s production is
crisp and clear, and the overall
effort ranks among one of the
year’s best. This album ﬁnds
The Walkmen at the top of their
game. All qualms aside, You &
Me is heartily recommended to
any and all who enjoy indie rock
at W&L.

Disidentiﬁcation, also called
“detached witnessing,” allows
people to be apart from the
mind, and “experience non-dual
awareness, of being disidentifed
from the mind,” wrote Lilly. She
differentiated between disidenti-

identiﬁcation through analyz-
ing, judging, and bargaining
processes. However, a spiritual
paradox rules disidentiﬁcation.
Lilly elaborated by saying that,
“The mind can’t free itself from
the mind; the mind (as the seat

“The mind can ’t free itself from the mind;
the mind..cann0t propel itself directly into

awareness; it can only indirectly achieve

awareness. ”

ﬁcation and indifference, where
disidentiﬁcation is intended to be
more experiential. Disidentiﬁca-
tion, according to Lilly, is “an
inward turning of attention” that
ponders the questions of what
is occurring in one’s experience
currently, as well as whether one
can embrace that situation.
Though disidentiﬁcation is
ideal, Lilly highlighted the fact
that it is often quite diﬁicult to
achieve. The mind resists dis-

of will) cannot propel itself di-
rectly into awareness; it can only
indirectly achieve awareness.
The mind’s basic operation is
resistance, whereas awareness
doesn’t resist; it’s all-embrac-
ing.”

Lilly went on to say that the
more removed one is, the closer
one becomes with one’s experi-
ences. However, the apparent
paradox with awareness is that
“both are completely detached

and completely intimate with
experience at the same time,”
wrote Lilly.

Students from various phi-
losophy courses attended the
lecture.

“I haven’t studied much phi-
losophy other than for the class
I’m in now, so the lecture taught
me about something I wasn’t
very familiar with,” said sopho-
more Anna Herrnesmann.

Although students may not
have frilly understood Lilly’s
ideas, they were able to appre-
ciate the concepts. “The ideas
of the lecture were interesting,”
said Hermesmann.

Students also preferred at-
tending Lilly’s lecture as op-
posed to reading about the same
concepts from text.

“It was refreshing to have
an actual lecture as opposed to
a lecture where a scholar reads
from a manuscript on which they
are working,” said Paige Wiley.

However, Hermesmann and
Wiley were not the only stu-
dents who found Lilly’s con-
cepts interesting. Ashna Sharan,
a philosophy student, related the
ideas presented in the lecture to

her own life.

“I found the lecture very in-
teresting because I related it
to one of my philosophies that
branch from Indian culture: ful-
ﬁll your dharrna (duty) because
you should and not for the re-
wards or result. There are many
chores which I might not prefer
to do, such as folding laundry,
but I detach myself from the
emotions and fold the laundry
because I should,” said Sharan.

Lilly received her B.A. from
The College of William and
Mary, a Ph.D. in philosophy
from Princeton, and an M.F.A
from Cornell. She has taught
courses at assorted universities
on philosophy, including W&L.
She is also the author of The
Insights of Higher Awareness:
Understanding Spiritual Truth
and Egoand the Spiritual Self: A
Path to Awareness. In addition,
Lilly has written poems and ar-
ranged them into two separate
collections- You Want to Sell Me
a Small Antique and Shadwell
Hills, a collection of Haiku po-
ems.

As the 2008 Major League
Baseball season comes to a
close, we look back on a year
that deﬁed tradition, rewrote the
record books and said goodbye
to one of the most sacred struc-
tures that the game has ever

One major story that has re-

been zero positive steroid tests
at the major league level this
season.

Although the passionate fans

as to which team is the best, the
statistics prove that they are col-

With three of the top six offens-
es, the NFC East is averaging
about 40 points per team more
than its opponents in non-divi-
sional games combined.

However, often fans of AFC
teams and other NFC teams are
too concerned with their own

lineup.

Many of the current Rays
have been developed through
the organization, which has
been very patient with most
of its prospects, and are now
showing the world the reasons
for their high amateur billing.

One off-season trade seemed
to set the season in motion for
the new-look Rays. Delmon
Young had been a Baseball
America top prospect for two
straight years and had success
in his rookie year with the big
league club; however, some

who can ’t compete in free agent
signings and are forced to build
their team from the ground up.

It isn’t very often that a sure-
fire first ballot hall of famer is
traded from a contender to a
team on the brink of elimina-
tion, but the Manny Ramirez
saga that captivated our atten-
tion during the trade deadline
became one of the biggest sto-
ries of the year.

Ramirez had become a main-
stay in the Boston lineup and
was an integral part of the two

questions about attitude and
dedication led to Young’s being
dealt to the Minnesota Twins
for two other former top pros-
pects, pitcher Matt Garza and
shortstop Jason Bartlett.
Inserting Bartlett and jour-
neyman free-agent signee Eric
Hinske and placing Matt Garza
and thirty-nine-year oltf closer
Troy Percival on the pitch-
ing staff drew some criticism
league wide, but the Rays were
committed to sticking with their
plan. Many teams started out as
fast as the Rays did but eventu-
ally faded; theARays were able
to stay aﬂoat for the entire year.
The Rays were able to tap
into contributions from ﬁrst-
round studs like rookie-of-the-
year candidate Evan Longoria
and scrap-heap acquisitions
like Carlos Pena to weather the
storm of injuries in their rota-
tion and their bullpen to clinch a
playoff spot for the ﬁrst time in
franchise history. The Rays not
only serve as a source of valida-
tion for the much maligned Col-
lective Bargaining agreement,
which is meant to level the
playing ﬁeld for smaller mar-
ket teams, but they also serve
as a blueprint for other teams

is what really matters. Whether
in a league for big time money
(sorry all NCAA athletes), play-
ing for free online or in the con-
stantly smack-talking group of
friends, Fantasy Football has
become a cultural phenomenon
within the NFL community. It
unites and divides, both building
friendships and breaking them.
On whatever level though, own-
ers are always searching for that
edge: This year it can be found
in the NFC East.

The NFC East is a hotbed for
fantasy stars this year, from top
to bottom. Popular sleeper picks
such as Philly’s Desean Jackson,
or value picks like Washington’s
Santana Moss or Dallas’ Jason
Witten, have outperformed ev-
ery conceivable prediction of
success. Once again, to throw
out some statistics, all four NFC
East quarterbacks are in the top-
ten in terms of fantasy points,
averaging close to sixty on the
season. Furthermore the running
backs continue to dominate:
Marion Barber ranking second
in the NFL with 64 points and
Clinton Portis heating up with
44—points, more coming in the
last two weeks after a poor ﬁrst
week performance.

that the Red Sox have won in
the past four years. His jovial
personality and savant-like hit-
ting ability made Ramirez a
loveable character in Boston
folklore; however, he seemed to
have worn out his welcome in
the month of July when many
fans questioned his effort after
his sometimes lackadaisical
play. The Red Sox may have
thought of the trade as addition
by subtraction and didn’t come
out of the trade empty handed,

At the trade deadline, the
Dodgers were on their way out
of the playoff race, but with a
slump from the Arizona Dia-
mondbacks and an MVP perfor-
mance from Manny Ramirez,
the Dodgers have clinched the
NL West title. After some early
talk of Brewers hired gun CC
Sabathia’s possibly taking the
NL Cy Young Award for best
pitcher, Ramirez has stolen all
buzz about post-season awards.

Since the trade, Ramirez has .

led the National League in all
Triple Crown categories and
has raised the question of how
many games a player needs to
play to truly be considered the
most valuable player.

he has been a great inﬂuence
on the young Dodger hitters,
who have picked up their play
dramatically over the past two
months.

In addition, Brian Westbrook
ranks seventh, after only playing
a quarter of last week's game.
As every fantasy owner knows,
running backs are the most es-
sential tool for league domina-
tion, and each team provides
viable options should a star go
down. As was the case with
Westbrook and the Eagles, util-
ity man Correll Buckhalter eas-
ily compensated, outperform-
ing many league starters last
week. The Handcuff for a NFC
East running back (“handcuff’
meaning their back up, who you
picked jut in case your star goes
down with an injury) in most
instances is better than other
starters, such as Buckhalter, the
over-performing Felix Jones,
Derrick Ward, or even Ladell
Betts on occasion.

In addition to running backs,
the NFC East has three top-ten
receivers in Terrell Owens, San-
tana Moss and Plaxico Burress.
The high-ﬂying passing attacks
in the division are not only ben-
eﬁting the receivers but also the
tight ends. Jason Witten domi-
nates all statistical catergories
for the position, yet L.J. Smith,
Kevin Boss and Chris Cooley
are also having solid seasons.

of baseball’s most recognizable
stadiums. ‘.

With some of the usual sus-
pects prepped for a_,run at Oc-
tober like the Boston Red Sox,
Chicago White Sox, Los An-
geles Angels of Anaheim, and
Philadelphia Phillies, the lov-
able Chicago Cubs and the new
kid on the block in .Tampa Bay,
a ﬁtting history will be written
for sure this October.

To put it simply, the NFC
East is running ‘the table in
Fantasy Football. With the top
player at every position (other
than kicker, but 'w'lio cares),
and at least three players in the
top-12 of every position (sorry,
kickers), you really; can’t go
wrong. One more thing to think
about, though, is the fact that
the teams within the division
play every team ,twice, giving
each team six divisional games.
The defenses in thedivision are
weak against passl,A,:coverage,
giving up disproportignate pass-
ing yards and pointspbeneﬁting
both quarterbacks and receivers
in the league. ,3.

To everyone whoggplays se-
riously: we all know its more
than just some online pastime,
“fantasy world,”A or for that mat-
ter, a game. It is life or death
every Sunday whengyou check
your players’ statistics, holding
out hope that your one receiver
playing on Monday Night Foot-
ball can get you 18 points to beat
your obnoxious friend. across the
hall. If you really want to win,
both in real football and fantasy,
pick the NFC East. It truly is un-
stoppable.

Women’s soccer falls to
national powerhouse

F irst-ranked Messiah scored with 8 seconds left in ﬁrst overtime to beat
Lady Generals 4-3 Saturday in rainy conditions at Watt Field

By Adam cancryn

Rain-soaked Watt Field played host to
a soccer classic on Saturday, as Washing-
ton & Lee’s women’s soccer team came
within minutes of upsetting number one
ranked Messiah University.

Using speedy forwards and set piec-
es to pressure the Messiah defense, the
Generals showed no fear of their highly
touted opponents.

“We were always consciously not
playing the writing on their jersey, we
were playing our game,” said senior
forward Anne Van Devender, who set up
two corner kick goals and added another
of her own. “We came out with conﬁ-
dence and nobody came out scared.”

In the end, Messiah’s offensive attack
was too much for the unranked Generals.
But, for the majority of the game, it was
W&L that looked like the nation’s best.
After Messiah jumped out to a lead with
a goal in the 10“‘ minute, the Generals
took control.

Using a counter-attack designed to
take advantage of W&L’s quickness up
front, the Generals pressured Messiah
into conceding corner kicks.» Off of the
set pieces, junior Maggie Sutherland and
ﬁrst-year Corinne Smith converted head-
ers to give their team the lead.

However, the Falcons showed the
resilience of a top-ranked team, coming
back to even the score two separate times
in the second half.

After controlling possession early in
the 2"“, Messiah got off a long shot that
slammed off the crossbar. The rebound
settled perfectly in front of Messiah’s
Rachel Loya, who put in the easy goal.

The tie was short-lived, though, as ten
minutes later Van Devender gave Wash-
ington & Lee the lead once again.

Taking a pass just outside the 18-
yard line, the senior captain maneuvered
around her defender, leaving a clear path
to the goal. A couple of dribbles later,
Van Devender netted her team-leading
eighth goal of the year.

With only twenty minutes left follow-
ing the goal, W&L tried to preserve the
victory by falling back into a defensive
shell. But the strategy could not with-
stand the ensuing barrage of shots.

Given space in the middle of the ﬁeld,

and—forth period, Erin Hench struck
again. The sophomore forward beat
her defender to a loose ball and spoiled
W&L’s upset bid, sneaking the ball past
Moreo as she came out to challenge.

Messiah University narrowly escaped
Watt Field with their perfect record, but
also served notice that this young W&L
team can be a national force.

Van Devender, one of just ﬁve seniors
on a roster of 28, felt conﬁdent the team
would beneﬁt from such a hard-fought
game.

“It’s deﬁnitely the best game we’ve
played all season,” she said. “If we can

“It is deﬁnitely the best game we ’ve played all season...
If we can take this kind of intensity and kind of mental-

ily in our ODAC games we 71 be really successful this

season. ”

Anne Van Devender, senlor forward

Messiah’s Erin Hench launched a 25-
yard strike. W&L goalie Kiki Moreo had
no chance to prevent the equalizer.

Coming into Saturday’s game, Mes-
siah averaged nearly 28 shots per game,
an attack W&L fended off for much of
the afternoon. Eventually, though, the
Falcons began to create more scoring op-
portunities.

“They kept going and going and
ﬁnished some really great chances that
most other teams wouldn’t score,” said
head coach Neil Cunningham.

ln overtime, Messiah needed only
one chance.

With time winding down on a back-

take this kind of intensity and kind of
mentality into our ODAC games we’ll
be really successful this season.”

Coach Cunningham stressed that the
game could be a stepping stone as long
as the team responds well in spite of the
loss. More importantly, he was in awe of
the quality of soccer everyone had wit-
nessed.

“The game was by far the best game
l’ve been involved with coaching wise. ..
you can’t get any one as good as this
game for the spectacle of soccer.”

With the loss, the Generals are 4-3
(2-1 in the ODAC) going into the rest of
their conference play.

Football captures last-
second win once again

Team withstands late fourth-quarter push to beat Averett 31-23 Saturday
behind another strong performance by senior RB Stuart Sitterson

By Brian Devlne
STAFF WRITER

In their past two games, Washington
and Lee football has developed a ﬂair for
the dramatic. Last week in its home open-
er, the team scored two thrilling touch-
downs in the fourth quarter and needed
a last-second interception in the end zone
to prevent Southern Virginia from rety-
ing the game, and won 35-28.,This week
it was more of the same, as the Generals
scored 24 unanswered points to start the
second half and withstood a last-minute
comeback drive to beat the Averett Cou-
gars 31-23 in Salem, Virginia.

Again the hero for W&L was reign-
ing ODAC Offensive Player of the Week
Stuart Sitterson, who followed up his
electrifying two-touchdown, 311 all-pur-
pose yard game against SVU by leading
the Generals in rushing, receiving and re-
turn yardage. He also scored W&L’s ﬁrst
touchdown of their 24-point run with a
6—yard rush into the end zone to ﬁnish a
61-yard drive and make the score 14-7 in
W&L’s favor.

W&L extended its lead when the'Cou-
gars, set up to punt from their 33-yard
line, committed an awful mistake. The
snap went over punter Nathan Davis’
head and all the way out of the back of
the end zone. The referees awarded a
safety to the Generals, and the score was
16-7, midway through the third quarter.
Sitterson then returned the ensuing kick-
off 50 yards to the Averett 19-yard line.
With great ﬁeld position, Charlie West-
fal led his team into the end zone in just
three plays and freshman running back
Jonathan Clemo, beginning to emerge as
a reliable change-of-pace for Sitterson,

scored from three yards out. Sitterson
then scored on the two-point conversion
attempt to put the Generals up 24-7.

After three failed drives, the game en-
tered the fourth quarter. Westfal complet-
ed a six-yard touchdown pass to Tucker
Laurens, and Martin Prichard converted
the PAT, to put the Generals up by 24 and
the game seemingly out of reach. But
Averett quarterback Shan Fairbanks was
not ﬁnished yet. With ﬁve minutes on the
clock Fairbanks completed a touchdown
pass to Steve Oristian and Dontavius Wat-
son ran into the end zone for a success-
ful two-point conversion. A bad Spencer
Richards punt on the ensuing W&L drive
gave the Cougars good ﬁeld position and
Fairbanks capitalized, converting twice
on third down before throwing to Antho-
ny Squillini for his second passing TD of
the game. After Fairbanks passed to Wat-
son for the 2-point conversion the Gener-
als’ lead was only eight points.

To cap it all off, Averett recovered
their onside kick and had possession,
trailing by a touchdown, with 1:10 on the
clock. Just like last week against SVU,
the Generals had allowed their opponent
to make it close in the ﬁnal minute. But
this time no interception was needed as
Fairbanks threw three incomplete passes
and was sacked by Scott Russell to force

a turnover on downs. After a kneel-down,
the game was over with the Generals on
top 31-23.

Several bright spots emerged from the
game- for the ﬁrst time all season, W&L
gained more total yards than their op-
ponent. Prichard proved himself to be a
reliable placekicker and should have the
starting job next week. Westfal again was
solid, going 13-for-24 for 145 yards with
two touchdowns and no interceptions.

Until Averett’s late heroics, the defense A

was solid. Donavon Sawyer led the blue-
and-white with four tackles.

The Generals will suffer, however, if
they leave their guard down the rest of
the season. W&L begins conference play
against Randolph-Macon, who ﬁnished
second in the conference last year, next
week at Wilson Field. The Yellow Jack-
ets are an old-school football team, led
by bruising tailback Zak Thornton and
the conference’s best defense. The squad
has stumbled in pre-conference play, los-
ing to Johns Hopkins in triple overtime j
before beating Catholic in their confer-
ence opener last week. The game, Satur-
day at 1:30 p.m., will be the centerpiece
of Homecoming Weekend and the clash
of stars between Thornton and Sitterson

should be a great battle.
