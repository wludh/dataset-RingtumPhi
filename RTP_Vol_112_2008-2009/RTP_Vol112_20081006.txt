Race for the

White House

Former Va. Gov. Linwood

Holton ‘44 calls for a
changing of the guard

By Vlctorla Taylor
5 TA F F w a IT E R

The political panel held Friday in Lee
Chapel could not have come at a more ap-
propriate time.

A small but engaged group, of alumni,
students, faculty and the public listened to
former Virginia governor Linwood Holton
’44 discuss the coming presidential election
with politics professors Mark Rush and Bill
Connelly.

Holton predicted Sen. Barack Obama
would win the 2008 presidential election.

“If the Democrats can’t elect a president
under these circumstances, they ought to go
into the aluminum siding business,” he said.

Rush added, “I do think this is probably
one of the two most important elections, at
least in my lifetime.”

Connelly said party success on the na-
tional level can lead to losses in Congress in
the following mid-terrn elections.

“If Barack Obama wins...history suggests

the Democrats will lose seats in Congress

two years from now in 2010,” he said.
When he was elected governor in 1970,

Holton became Virginia’s ﬁrst post—Recon-

struction Republican governor. Although he

“If the Democrats can ’t elect
a president under these cir-
cumstances, they ought to

go into the aluminum siding

business. ”

Llnwood Holton, Former Va. Governor
 

is supporting Obama, Holton still considers
himself a Republican. Having been accused
of being a “maverick and a traitor,” he out-
lined a few reasons for his decision.

Holton said that he does not want to cause
a family rift since his daughter, Anne Holton,
is married to Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, a
Democrat. He also believes that Obama has
the “brain power” needed to be president of
the United States. Furthermore, Holton high-
lighted some of what he views as the failures
of the Bush Administration like the Iraq War
and the national deﬁcit.

“We’re in a mess and we need to make
the changes that are available by going to the
other party,” Holton said.

Discussion of political parties was a key
aspect of the panel. Holton said the very con-
servative core of the Republican Party can be
traced back to white supremacy in the south.
He stressed the need for the party to attain a
more universal appeal.

“I hope the Republican Party, if it does
lose as I think it will, learns the lesson to
get away from what started a hundred or so
years ago as southern strategy,” Holton said.
“They’ve got to come back to the middle.”

Holton brought up what he said has been
his political philosophy his entire career.

“Just vote for the way that it ought to be
for the outcomes of this country, and not for
the party,” he said.

Junior Catherine Carlock found the dis-
cussion “informative and enlightening.”

“Gov. Holton’s views challenged the
status quo and I think provided interesting
insight into the Presidential election,” she
said.

For the ﬁrst time in Washington
and Lee’s history, students will be able
to minor in their secondary area of in-
terest.

Passed by the faculty Monday,
Sept. 29, the decision to have minors
will take effect starting as early as the
next academic year.

But it will be up to individual de-
partments to decide whether they are
going to create minors.

The decision to adopt minors at
W&L began with the Environmental
Studies department. About a year ago,
the department was upgraded from an
interdisciplinary program to a major,
according to Dean Hank Dobin.

“The department said that it also
wanted to keep the original interdisci-
plinary program and interdisciplinary
programs are somewhat similar to mi-
nors,” Dobin said. This created a bit of
a crisis for the university because that
meant allowing a two-level structure

in the Environmental Studies depart-
ment and not in other departments.

At the same time, the administra-
tion was reviewing the academic life

ments for minors...some

initiative, which included shortening
spring term and reducing graduation
requirements. The shortened spring
term would make it harder for students
to double major, so the administration

began to look at the issue of allowing
them to minor in a secondary area of
interest.

“Additional pressure and urgency
[for creating a minor] were added by
the initiative,” Dobin said.

In response to the rising demand
and questions, Provost June Aprille
formed a special task force committee
to examine “whether interdisciplinary
majors may also maintain interdisci-
plinary programs; and whether minors
should be established,” according to
the Minors Task Force Report.

Prof. Kevin Crotty, who chaired the
committee, said the committee talked
with department heads at W&L, con-
tacted other schools that offer minors
and reviewed literature about minors.

“What we learned was that schools
with minors had no problem,” he said.

Some controversery over adopting
minors does exist. Students might be
so focused on amassing their credits
that they would Veer away from the
true liberal arts education, which en-

visions providing general knowledge
in various ﬁelds of studies. Another
concern is that double-major students
might decide to change one of their
majors into a minor, which would re-
sult in a decrease in majors in some
departments.

“It’s up to individual departments
to decide the structure and require-
ments for minors,” Crotty said. “Any
department can do whatever it wants.
Some are quite anxious to do it.”

Journalism Prof. Pamela Luecke
said that she sees advantages and dis-
advantages of having minors.

“It could attract students to devel-
op some expertise in other areas,” she
said. “But it would be a disadvantage
if it led to fewer people becoming pro-
ﬁcient in one area.”

The Journalism department has not
yet decided to create a minor. “We’re
split. We’ll probably meet again,” Lu-
ecke said.

Greek Summit aims to align Values

Students, administration discuss ways to close gap between expectations and behavior

By Joel Poelhuls
STA F F W R I TE R

Representatives from nearly every
fraternity and sorority on campus met
at the Greek Summit Oct. 27 to dis-
cuss the problems of sexual assault,
hazing and substance abuse. Both
student and administrative organiza-
tions took part in organizing the sum-
mit, which meets every three years to
address issues relevant to the Greek
community.

The theme for the day focused on
values congruence — on improving the
gap between institutional standards
like the W&L Honor System and be-
havior that is inconsistent with these
principles.

Topics for tlie summit arose from
the results of a survey administered by
the Greek Vision Council last spring.
The GVC was, in turn, founded in
response to several chapters’ suspen-
sions on hazing violations and alco-
hol-related hospitalizations on tear
night last school year.

Burr Datz, Director of Leader-
ship Development and Coordinator
of Religious Life, said his purpose at
the event was to start a conversation
among students to see if there was a
common purpose and direction. On
hazing, Datz expressed conﬁdence
that the greek community is making
progress, and that student leadership
is active on this and other issues.

Clay Coleman, the new Director
of Student Activities and Greek Life
said the initiative now lies with the
individual chapters and student gov-

ernment. He said greek organizations I

should maintain contact with their na-
tional leadership and hold each other
accountable to the values expressed in
their rituals.

Datz directed an interactive work-
shop at the summit in which attendees
determined which actions and activi-
ties constituted hazing. Groups came
to a consensus and stood if they be-
lieved a certain behavior qualiﬁed as
hazing. Examples ranged from “play-
ing drinking games until vomiting”

to “cleaning the chapter house once a
week.”

The itinerary also included presen-
tations by Dr. Jennifer Sayre, Campus
Psychologist, and Dr. Jane Horton,
Director of Health Services on sexual
assault and alcohol abuse. The presen-
tations addressed both hard statistics '
on these issues and misperceptions by
the student body.

According to Horton, high-risk
drinking has been steadily declin-
ing at W&L for the last decade, but
students don’t perceive this change.
Horton attributed this to a small but
highly visible group of students who
sway public perception.

Sayre presented some startling sta-
tistics about sexual assault on campus.
Though it is one of the most underre-
ported crimes, data show that sexual
assualt is about twice as prevalent at
W&L compared with the national av-
erage on university campuses. Sayre
says this means about twenty women
a year are victimized.

During Sayre’s presentation there

was audible giggling from isolated
parts of the audience. Carson Bruno,
who served as Master of Ceremonies
for the event, characterized this as an
immature way of dealing with uncom-
fortable material.

“It’s a tough topic to discuss. It
makes a lot of people uneasy ,and
nervous. I think the reaction was a
way for those people to deal with the
topic.” '

The summit was sponsored by Or-
der of Omega, Panhellenic, the Inter-
fraternity Council, NPHC, the Office
of Student Activities & Greek Life,
and the Greek Vision Council.

Bruno said the event was a learn-
ing opportunity.

“We have one of the strongest - if
not the strongest - Greek communities
in the country, but that doesn’t mean
we are perfect. We do stupid things
sometimes, but if we can learn from
those and improve our chapters from
those lessons, we will build a strong
Greek community.” '

Vice Presidential alin

Abel Delgado saw Palin do what she needed to in the

By Abel Delgado
COLUMNIST

For Sarah Palin, the Vice
Presidential debate‘ could not
have been more dangerous.

She could have killed any
chance Republicans had of stay-
ing in the White House with one
poor response at the vice presi-
dential debate.

Instead she held her own
against Joe Biden, once again
beating expectations and con-
necting With the heartland and
‘silent majority.’

The past two weeks have been
one knife stab after another into
the McCain Campaign culminat-
'ing with the mindboggling deci-
sion to pull operations in Michi-
gan and keep them in Iowa.

Whether fair or not, McCain
is blamed for the Bush economy,
so it makes sense that recent
polls have him dropping faster
than the Dow Jones.

America’s love affair with
the Governor of Alaska was also

Homophobia shows disrespect

beginning to look like a short
ﬂing due to some embarrassing
responses to media questions.

What McCain needed was
a change of subject. He needed
people to stop thinking about
bailout and go back to what they
were thinking in early Septem-
her.

He needed Palin to legitimize
herself while attacking Obama,
and Palin did just that.

No, Palin did not beat Joe
Biden, but that wasn’t her inten-
tion. Biden had a great debate
answering questions and attack-
ing John McCain like any good
Democratic Vice Presidential
Candidate should.

But people weren’t paying at-
tention to Biden before the debate

and probably will not after. That.

might be good news for Demo-
crats, as Biden has the uncanny
ability to remind voters he has a
higher IQ than them, criticize his

own campaign’s “terrible” ads,.

and disagree with his running

mate on everything from troop
funding to clean coal. .

CNN’s David Gergen called
this the best debate of Biden’s
career. What was important was
more what Biden didn’t say than
what he did say.

rot, blaming the government for
corruption and mismanagement
and speaking straight to an angry
“Middle America.”

She had a folksy line here and
there but she had her fair share of
zingers too. She did two things

Palin was the main story coming out of the

debate and thats back to being a good thing

for Republicans. She was one part Ronald

Reagan and two parts Ross Perot...

Restrained doesn’t begin to
describe Biden’s responses in_ St.
Louis.

Palin was the main story com-
ing out of the debate and that’s
back to being a good thing for
Republicans.

She was one part Ronald
Reagan and two parts Ross Pe-

exceptionally well.

She repeatedly pointed out
how Biden criticized Obama
during the Democratic debates
for things that McCain is criti-
cizing him for now.

She also reminded everyone
that Biden once said he’d be
honored to run with McCain.

l/zce Presidential Debate

The second thing she did
was toss away the Bush-McCain
comparisons with one line, say-
ing that for a ticket committed to
the future Obama and Biden sure
focused a lot on the. past.

Apparently McCain’s laundry
list of examples where he fought
the Bush administration have not
been enough, so Republicans
might be better served making
Democrats look like they are
just whining about the past eight
years while McCain and Palin
focus on the future.

Palin drilled away at her topic
of expertise, energy indepen-
dence.

She avoided or quickly an-
swered some questions in order
to spend more time talking about
energy, something that connects
with voters every time they see
gas prices.

She lost the debate on foreign
policy, no surprise there, but she
arguably won the debate early on
domestic policy by connecting

with working-class Americans.
More importantly, she far sur-
passed the low expectations the
mainstream media set for her.

Palin didn’t have to win the
debate.

She doesn’t have to prove
she is experienced enough to be
president.

She has to prove she is expe-
rienced enough to be vice-presi-
dent and that Obama is not expe-
rienced enough to be president.

She needed to connect with
center-right America and she
needed to justify McCain’s
choice of her.

She took many steps in that
direction.

Perhaps the best indicator of
how Palin did was that a Demo-
cratic strategist said she set her-
self up well for 2012.

If McCain manages to con-
nect with Americans’ concerns
the way Palin did, Palin won’t
have to wait that long.

Its time to call out homophobia at W&L for what it is--disrespectful of GLBT students

By Jean Chapman
co rum msr

Monday, Sept. 29 marked the
start of National Coming-Out
Week on campus.

I know that as this is be-
ing read, it’s likely that the vast
majority of readers either aren’t
aware of this fact or are roll-
ing their eyes and saying “who
cares?”

That’s a problem, folks.

Whenever a gay rights is-
sue or statistic about the GLBT
community is presented, apa-
thy is rampant. Those statistics,
however meaningful, poignant,
or downright shocking, go right
over the heads of our oblivious
student body.

I don’t.mean to imply that
no one on campus cares, or that
things aren’t getting better. In
fact, there are quite a few people
who care, and things are getting
better.

The ﬁrst GSA meeting of
the year ﬁlled the Women’s Re-
source room in the Commons
to capacity. The Safe Place

Program, which offers students
an accepting and comfortable
location to talk about issues
of sexuality, gender, and other
personal issues, has been grow-
ing steadily since its inception.
Last spring, the GSA handed out
a record number of “Gay? Fine
by me” shirts on campus, and
students and teachers alike wore
them with sincerity, pride, and
enthusiasm.

So why, despite all of this
progress, do so many people
simply not care?

Or, what’s worse, why do so
many individuals on this campus
treat the issue of gay rights with

‘an utter lack of respect and out-
right contempt?

Why did the members of GSA
get openly laughed at as they put
up ﬂyers around campus?

Why did many of those same
ﬂyers get torn down by the next
morning?

‘ That’s right, it’s true. Several
of the volunteers putting up ﬂyers
were mocked right from the very
beginning of their midnight cam-

paign. One member of the GSA
reported that only minutes after
she put brochures in the lobby of
the Science Center, she saw stu-
dents who were studying there
gathered together making fun of

There are a lot of ﬂyers on
campus bulletin boards, dorm
halls, and academic buildings.

Just on my way to class this
morning I saw advertisements for
upcoming theater events, speak-

Apparently, our campus as a whole respects

the information in the pamphlets
and laughing out loud.

Flyers that were placed in the
academic buildings on the colon-
nade were torn down by 7:45 the
morning after they were put up.

Last year during this same
week, I saw several of the GSA
ﬂyers graﬁitied with obscene
and offensive phrases that don’t
bear repeating in decent conver-
sation.

ers, and concerts. I saw several
that provided me with statistics
and information on people who
were displaced by ﬂooding and
natural disasters in Asia; posters
like these are very common.

I found it particularly interest-
ing that no one tears these post-
ers down hours after they are put
up, and no one writes obscene
comments on them, either.

Apparently, our campus as a

whole respects the Rugby Club
more than they respect their fel-
low students. And, apparently,
our campus ﬁnds this discrep-
ancy amusing as well.

Let’s be honest with our-
selves here, people. Why is this
disrespect so funny?

Aren’t we all mature enough
as adults to take this kind of is-
sue seriously?

Read those statistics on the
ﬂyers, or pick up a brochure and
read it carefully.

Suicide, harassment, discrim-
ination, basic civil rights: none
of that is funny.

Issues inﬂuencing the GLBT
community affect us all. We
all have classmates, peers, and
probably friends or family, who
are gay, lesbian, bisexual or
questioning their sexuality.

At the very least, it’s our
responsibility to them to be in-
formed and respectful.

I know it can be difficult to
overcome old ways of thinking,
and I know that thinking about
these issues can feel uncomfort-

able sometimes.
That’s ﬁne. No one said this

‘had to be easy, noone said it was

going to be totally comfortable.
But when things are difﬁcult,
that’s when they’re the most im-
portant.

That’s when integrity and
honor really matter.

I’m not trying to get anyone
to radically change their opinion
here.

I’m not saying you have to
go vote for a certain candidate,
donate money to a cause, or vol-
unteer your time.

What I am asking for, though,
is for everyone who reads this
article to read one piece of infor-
mation about a GLBT issue this
week.

Read it and think about it
seriously, without laughing and
mocking. It’s not that hard.

Just think of it as an exercise
in respect, because in the end,
that’s what National Coming-
Out Week and the GSA are all
about: respect.

Your television is ruining America

Call him an old fogey if you want, but Crighton Allen sees little but swill on our television channels

By crlghton Allen
0 0 L U M N I ST

There is a pressing issue in
America that needs addressing
immediately: the swill that is
currently on my TV.

Make it stop.

Cable TV is one of the great-
est inventions of our or any other
time, but this is getting out of
hand. Have you ever seen The
Hills? I saw a rerun once this
summer and about ﬁve minutes
in, I began desperately longing
for Calculus class.

I know Lauren Conrad, Spen-
cer Pratt, and Co. aren’t exactly
Rhodes Scholar material, but
would it be a burden for them to
like, you know, speak a coherent
sentence in like, English?

I saw that Lauren will begin
writing a series of young adult
ﬁction novels called L.A. Candy
that will be “loosely based” on
her life. Oh, do tell. For those

English professors who are
scrambling to amend next year’s
syllabi, that’s C-0-N-R-A-D.

Some other offerings make
The Hills look like a Ken Burns
documentary.

How about Paris Hilton ’s My
New BFF or Busted? That sec-
ond offering might need some
further elaboration.

Two couples are brought to a
swanky resort, and then prompt-
ly separated and one partner is
paired for a romantic weekend
with one of their former squeez-
es. Their current partners are
then given various means to spy
on the newly reunited couples via
hidden microphones and touch
sensors. Alter the weekend, the
partners are forced to choose be-
tween their old or current signiﬁ-
cant other.‘

Classy.

Word of advice: if you must
watch it, don’t do so with Great
Aunt Mille or Father Joe. Talk

about awkward.

Unless you yourself are a
total hedonist, you have come
to realize.that we as a public do
not exactly possess the highest,
classiest taste.

Show a little skin, throw in
some male-female interaction,
struggle for a prize, and you’ve
got a show that will enthrall mil-
lions.

Sex and competition, that’s
what America does baby.

In that vein, how about this
for a show title: Dirty, Sexy Mon-
ey. I expect that show to have a
long successful run.

From what I’ve heard about
Gossip Girl, federal law should
require a warning disclaimer be-
fore public showings, but my 16-
year-old sister and her friends are
all up on Serena’s most recent
late-night cavorting involving
booze and boys.

Warms my heart.

The kicker in all this, though,

is that these shows are on the
air because they are demanded.
American television producers
may come up with dumb shows,
but they themselves are not.
They are smart enough to gauge
the tastes of the American pub-
lic.

After all, this is the same
American public that made Ti-
tanic the highest-grossing ﬁlm
ever.

I know we all are at once at-
tracted and repulsed by all this,
I get it. But I seriously believe
that Americans’ utter obsession
with this sleazy programming is
hurting us in the more ways than
one.

According to Nielson Media,
the average American watches
four and a half hours of TV a
day. I wonder how many hours
the average Chinese or Indian
watches per day?

I bet you Southern Inn brunch
it’s a darn sight less than 4.5.

As their economies continue
to grow and diversify, coupled
with their national cultural re-
spect for hard work, how much
longer can we expect to hold our
advantage when we can’t tear
our eyes off MTV?

People oftentimes bemoan
that “traditional values” — what-
ever that really means — have
eroded in America. I agree and I
think that these shows may have
something to do with it all.

Call me an old fogey, but
when kids today grow up in a
culture that promotes promiscu-
ous, immoral behavior, can we
really expect anything else?

Kids are going to watch TV;
there’s no way around that, but
when most of what is on the
tube today would make Britney
Spears blush, one has to ask if we
are shirking our duty in providing
our most impressionable citizens
with the proper role models.

Because like it or not, celebri-

ties, television personalities, and
athletes have vaulted into that
hallowed spot in the minds of
many American youth.

America, you’re better than
this.

Have your guilty pleasures;
everyone needs them, but back in
the day that used to mean Rocky
Road ice cream at midnight or
David Hasselhoff’s Greatest
Hits. .

We as a nation all are called
to a higher standard than most of
what cable TV has to offer. We
as a public have to power to take
back our televisions.

Refuse to watch these shows!
They’re trash and you know it.

Expect better of yourself. If
your life is that devoid of mean-
ing that you need to live vicari-
ously through reality TV stars,
go volunteer in a soup kitchen.

That is a far truer reality than
anything MTV or Fox can ever
have to offer.

Professor Dennis Garvis of
Business Administration said
his department would not have

~ a minor.

“There was a wide variety of
opinions within the faculty. We
couldn’t reach an agreement,” he
said. “Even though some people
think we have a business school,
we don’t have a business school
here. We don’t have the typical
business major.”

Normally, a business school
will divide into many sections
such as marketing, management,
banking and entrepreneurship,
but that kind of curriculum is not
available at W&L, Garvis said.

“Some people might say we
have a general kind of degree,”

he said. “There is no specializa-
tion.”

The Business department is
concerned with the content of the
minor, if it were to have one.

“How much exposure to the
topic could you get?” asked Gar-
vis.

The Politics department is
also not planning to have a mi-
nor, said Politics Prof. Mark
Rush.

“At this point, we just don’t
feel the need to create minors,”
he said.

The English department, on
the other hand, is considering
proposing a creative writing mi-
nor, according to English Prof.
Lesley Wheeler. I

“Students have expressed in-
terest in studying creative writ-
ing before,” she said. This way,
those who want to study in Eng-
lish and another subject but do
not have the time for a double
major will be able to choose the

editorial

A minor thank you

Minors will make students more academically free

We all have good reason to be singing
praises for the faculty and administration
this week: last Monday the faculty voted
to allow academic departments to offer mi-
nors.

Thank goodness!

Of course, a lot of what makes W&L
such a ﬁne institution comes from what
makes us unique—things we have that other

education, in which students sample a wide
variety of courses rather than focusing on
one or two areas. But if this open-ended
education is so important, why were we ul-
timately limited to double majoring if we’re
interested in more than one area?

It’s true that employers and graduate
schools will want to see the variety of inter-
ests that comes with the liberal arts, but they

W&L students had been given a severe disadvantage in

not being able to minor in aﬁeld... The new minors will

allow many more students to tack on an extra ﬁeld of spe-
cialization...thank you, W&Lfacully! Itiv about time.

 

universities don’t. Spring Term. The Honor
System. Dressing up for football games. In
some areas, we’ll always have other schools
beat.

But W&L students had been given a se-
vere disadvantage in not being able to mi-
nor in a ﬁeld of study.

The reason for the lack of minors was,
supposedly, to encourage the liberal arts

also want to see a specialization. Or two.

It’s pretty difﬁcult to double major, es-
pecially for students with diverse interests
that require a dual degree. The new minor
will allow many more students to tack on an
extra ﬁeld of specialization.

Now professors and cleans have always
told us that it doesn’t matter that we don’t
have minors. We can take the classes we

want, and they will all show up on our tran-
scripts. But is every potential employer go-
ing to even see our transcripts? Probably
not. Even if the same courses are involved,
an applicant whose resume reads “Jounal-
ism major and French minor” is going
to look much more impressive than one
with “Joumaliam major and 12 credits in
French.” This is a case‘ where the title does
make a difference.

Some departments are worried that they
will be hurt by the change, anticipating that
fewer students will major if they have the
chance to minor. But the current situation
hurts students who give up their secondary
interest because they are unable to double
major. Students should be our ﬁrst priority.

Plus, minors will likely give rise to ﬁelds
of study that we haven’t seen before at
W&L. The English department would like
to create a minor in creative writing. Maybe
we’ll also see minors like photojournalism,
ﬁlm studies, or other new ﬁelds.

If we truly consider ourselves to be a
school that competes with other top col-
leges, this is something we’ve needed for
a while.

So, thank you, W&L faculty! It’s about
time. i

 
     
        
  

 

    

option of a minor.”

“The double major locks you
out of the elective courses and I
think one of the ideals of a liberal
arts education is intellectual ex-
ploration,” she said.

Wheeler expressed concern
that if some departments decide
not to create minors, it could
have a negative effect on depart-
ments that do have minors.

For example, students who
try to double major in English
and Politics and need to scale
down later would have to choose
an English minor and Politics
major.

“I wouldn’t like to see such
pressures dampen enrollments in
our upper-level courses,” Wheel-
er said.

Junior Darinka Truebutschek
had similar notions with regard
to having individual departments
set different policies for minors.

“That’s not fair,” she said.
“The school should have the

same policy in all departments.
You either have a minor or don’t
have a minor.”

“I think you don’t need the
title [of] ‘minor’ if you’re really
interested in a subject. You can
still take classes,” she said.

Spanish Prof. Florinda Ruiz
emphasized the practicality of
having a minor.

“It’s a result of the changing
nature of the job market,” she
said. “The university is trying to
accommodate the needs of the
graduates.”

Many students majoring in
one area don’t take all the cours-
es necessary for the Spanish ma-
jor, Ruiz said. And when they
go out into the job market with
a resume that says “near-native
Spanish” instead of “Spanish mi-
nor,” employers will most likely’
favor applicants with the latter
credentials.

“I only see it as an improve-
ment for offering the need to stu-

I

dents. I work outside the Univer-

_sity a lot and I can tell you that

many job markets want speciﬁc
certiﬁcates,” Ruiz said. “I’m all
for it. In language, a minor is
deﬁnitely a plus.” ,

Russian Prof. Anna Brodsky
expressed a similar view.

“Science major students just
don’t have the time to take cours-
es in the Russian language ma-
jor,” she said. “It’s great, I think,
for science majors to have an op-
portunity to minor in other areas
that they might be interested in.”

Sophomore Granvil George,
a Philosophy and Neuroscience
double major, said, “I think
some departments, like music,
will beneﬁt from having a minor
because most students who are
interested in studying music but
not to the extent of majoring in
it will gladly choose the option
of a minor.”

He said he would not choose
to minor himself, however.

‘‘I will still double major
because I want to leave my op-
tions open when I go to graduate
school,” George said.

“W&L students are awfully
bright and awfully ambitious,”
Crotty said. “Doub1e-majors
[changing to a minor] won’t be a
big problem.”

So far, most departments are
still in the process of deciding
whether to create minors. With
certain complexities that may
arise out of the situation, the ef-
fect of implementing minors is
hard to determine.”

“I think it’s a good move,”
Dobin said. “It allows students
to follow a coherent, structured
study in a secondary area of in-
terest and to show it on the di-
ploma. It’s a necessary option for
students.”

Artist exhibits landscape photos‘

Local photographer captures scenes of ‘natural beauty ’

By Liz Blackwood
STAFF WRITER

The Kamen Gallery in Washington
and Lee University’s Lenfest Center
will feature one of Lexington’s own
local photographers, Lloyd Goad.

The exhibit will be open for view-
ing until Dec. 4.

A tech coordinator at the univer-
sity, Goad lives in town and regularly
makes the beautiful scenery around
him the subject of his powerful pho-
tographs. Ranging from landscapes
of Virginia’s countryside to long
stretches of train track, “My Path,”
Goad’s current exhibit, is a reﬂeetion
of his goal to “capture the beauty of
ordinary situations.”

Although greatly inspired by his
local surroundings, Goad has trav-
eled to places as far away as Italy and
Greece to take his photographs. F 01-
lowing his wife’s death, Goad started
a fund to continue a trip she, as a local
high school Latin teacher, sponsored
to the Mediterranean each year.

During the trip, Goad took sev-

eral pictures. These photographs, of
the Aegean Sea, that are showcased
in his exhibit, are a personal favorite
of mine. Taken from the deck of a
ferry traveling from Italy to Greece,
two of the photos were shot at ﬁve
o’ clock in the morning. The smooth
luminescence provided by the rising
sun is just one of the many instances
in which the artist plays with varying
light.

No doubt the exhibit is uniform in
its selection of favorite landscapes;
however, the times of day and year
in the pictures range dramatically.
Snow, sunshine, clouds are featured
stars in his pictures.

“I try to capture the natural beauty
in the world,” Goad said in a recent
interview. “The moment I realize I’m
looking at something spectacular, I
take a picture ofit.”

Landscapes, however, are not
Goad’s only subjects, although, they
are greatly favored in his portfolio.
The artist has taken portraits of some
that are close to him, but usually his
pictures that feature people are those

In col-
lege, he wanted to paint. “But I
was pretty lousy at it,” he said with
a laugh. Soon after this realization,
Goad picked up a camera and began
taking pictures. “I was told my pho-
tographs were pretty good, so I kept
taking more.”

Obviously, what was once just
an alternative to Goad has become a
full-ﬂedged passion of his. The Cor-
pus Christi, Texas native carries his
camera everywhere he goes in case
he stumbles across something “spec-
tacular.”

“I like photography because I’m
capturing scenery instead of creating
it on a canvas like with painting.”

Yet, Goad has managed to create
several striking windows in his ex-
hibit. Check out Lloyd Goad’s photo-

Gay-straight educates "

GSA spreads the word about coming out week

By Stephanie Hardlman
surr wnman

Washington and Lee’s Gay-Straight
Alliance (GSA) celebrated National Com-
ing Out Week last week with an attempt to
educate the campus about gay issues.

GSA president Krishna Rao said the
group posted ﬂiers around campus late
Sunday night with facts and statistics about
being gay. They left Skittles candies with
myths and facts about the _ gay community
stapled to them in Leyburn Library, Elrod
Commons, and the science center for any-
one to take.

National Coming Out Week is orga-
nized by the Human Rights Campaign
which supports equality through lobbying
for gay people. The week is ofganized and
observed internationally. The goal is to
discuss alternative lifestyles and celebrate
the lifestyle choices that everyone, gay or
straight, has made.

GSA also showed the ﬁlm Boys Don’t
Cry in the Stackhouse Theatre on Thurs-
day. The movie follows the real life of
Brandon Teena, a transgendered young
adult who chooses to live her life as a man.
When Brandon’s friends discover he is not
who he seems, the consequences are fatal.

Boys Don ’t Cry is now available along
with over 60 other ﬁlms and books on les-
bian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered is-
sues in Leybum Library. GSA donated the
media over the summer after realizing the
library lacked material on this subject.

GSA vice president Tim Kirby believes
this material is vital to the campus. “It’s a
basic thing that the university should have,
and it’s very relevant to today,” Kirby
said.

Rao made a point to mention that in

addition to ﬁctional ﬁlms, GSA included
many scholarly sources in their donation
such as the Encyclopedia of Gay and Les-
bian Popular Culture.

The gift known as the Leybum Library
Project was valued at over $3,000, said
Kirby who compiled the list of media dur-
ing spring term.

Kirby hopes that GSA’s initiatives will
create a more accepting environment for
LGBT students on campus. Statistically,
Kirby and Rao both said that there should
be more gay students on campus.

With approximately 10 to 15 W&L
students out of the closet, Kirby wonders
where the others are. “What is going on?
[The situation] raises that question,” Kirby
said. “If there really are only 12 [gay stu-
dents], why is that? You have to look at
the atmosphere of the campus . . . why are
people still in the closet?” Kirby said.

W&L’s GSA hopes to address some
of these questions. The group has about
30 active members and is open not only
to those with a LGBT lifestyle but also to
straight people, commonly known as “al-
lies,” who support an open and safe cam-
pus for alternative lifestyles.

Rao said that GSA will sponsor its An-
nual Drag Show on Saturday, Oct. 18 on
the law school lawn. The event will be
a fundraiser for the Human Rights Cam-
paign. The event will be free to the public,
but donations are welcome. Rao said the
best way to enjoy the Drag Show is to par-
ticipate with an act. Participants dress up
as the opposite gender and may sing, lip
sync, or perform an act of their choosing.

Individuals interested in the Drag Show
or in joining GSA can contact Krishna Rao

Ben Folds ’latest album lacks his classic edge

By Michael Morella
c o PY E o ITO R

Ben Folds has always been deft at han-
dling life’s quirky little details: from de-
manding dinners back from ex-girlfriends
to delicately rendering Dr. Dre songs for
piano, the man has a way with words. But
on his third solo album, the pioneer of pia-
no rock delivers an album caught between
styles and moods, but lacking in the edge
that made him famous.

Way To Normal is Folds’ third solo stu-
dio album since he ditched his backing
band, Ben Folds Five, in 2000. Yet it’s
something like his ninth or tenth actual re-
lease, including live material, b-sides, and
his amazing work with his former group.
The proliﬁc 42-year-old music school
dropout has always has a penchant for
stringing together perfect little pop narra-

Regina Spektor, who provides a cute com-
plement to Folds’ ode to words best¥left
unsaid. Like so many of the songs on the
album, the track is undeniably catchy, but
nothing too far out of the ordinary from his
previous work.

Songs like “Free Coffee” and “Brain-
wascht” sound like familiar tracks in the
Ben Folds catalogue, but something about
them just doesn’t hold up. Folds has some
tricks up his sleeve, as he demonstrates
with the synth loop that begins “The
Frown Song” and the brief instrumental
interlude that introduces “Cologne,” ap-
propriately titled “Before Cologne.” But
even with all the frills, some of the songs
fall ﬂat, ﬁnding Folds treading over the
same subjects and employing some token
piano-pop conventions. Even while the
Billy-Joel-meets-Charlie-Brown arrange-
ment of “Eﬂington” sounds fresh and ex-

Ben Folds has always been deft at handling life is quirky
little details ﬂom demanding dinners back from ex-girl-

friends to delicately rendering Dr Dre songs...But on his

third solo album...delivers an album...lacking in edge

tives. And just as Folds has always used
pop culture against itself - see “Rockin’
the Suburbs,” Folds’ ode to his own lame-
ness — he weaves references to Anthropol-
ogie and CourtTV into this album’s lyrics,
always good for a chuckle.

This album is book-ended by two fan-
tastic songs: the ﬁrst, “Hiroshima,” recalls
an embarrassing performance injury in
his trademark epic goofball fashion. And
the closer, “Kylie From Connecticut,” is a
gorgeous little lament for a former lover,
complete with swirling strings and some
of Folds’ most impassioned vocals to date.
“Cologne” is another nice vignette, recall-
ing “Fred Jones Pt. 2” and some of the
other somber work he has done. And “Er-
rant Dog,” with its pulsing bass and spastic
drums, recalls the glory days of Ben Folds
Five. Folds continues to demonstrate that
he can switch from silly to serious with a
simple ﬂick of the wrist on the keys.

The album’s ﬁrst single, “You Don’t
Know Me,” ﬁnds Folds sharing vocal du-
ties with fellow singer/songwriter/pianist

citing, the lyrics fall ﬂat, almost too clever
for their own good.

One need only take note of the Paren-
tal Advisory sticker on the cover of the
album: Folds litters Way To Normal with
enough cursing and vulgarity to make even
Tipper Gore squeamish. While swearing
can be an art form, Folds splatters it all
over his canvas, marring what might oth-
erwise be a ﬁne collection of songs with
urmecessary “character” and over-the-top
gooﬁness. This album will grow on you,
but I don’t know if you’ll see it at the top
of any “Best of 2008” lists. At this stage in
his career, it would be hard for Folds to not
catch ﬂak from fans with whatever move
he makes, so at the very least he sounds
like he’s having ﬁin.

But while I still know all the words
to “One Angry Dwarf and 200 Solemn
Faces,” I can only hope that I’ll know the
words to some of these a few years down
the line.

Jeﬂers ’ poetry inﬂuenced
by Biblical and Native
American themes

By Jean Chapman
STAFF WRITER

Honoree Fanonne J effers, poet and associate professor of Eng-
lish at the University of Oklahoma, read from her work on Thurs-
day in the Staniar Gallery in Wilson Hall.

The event was sponsored by the Glasgow Endowment for vis-
iting writers which brings several writers to campus each year.
Professor Wheeler, Chair of the English Department and head of
the committee for the Glasgow Endowment, said that Jeffers was

“I don ’t do humorous poetrjy...it doesn’t
hurt my feelings when people say it is

sad. ”

Honoree Fanonne Jeffers, poet and OU professor of
English

chosen as the ﬁrst in this series of writers because of her incred-
ible talent and because of how well her work corresponded to
Professor Deborah Miranda’s course on twentieth century litera-
ture by women of color.

The gallery was ﬁlled with students, faculty, and staff, greeted
by Professor Wheeler who introduced J effers, praising her poetry
for its incorporation of spiritual, secular, and musical elements.
In particular, Professor Wheeler praised J effers’ ability to connect
the location of the writei toltlie meaning of the po'em.a*nd her i'1bil-
ity to “respect literary tradition by challenging it.”

After this brief introduction and a few additional comments,
J effers opened the reading by reciting a poem from her first book
of poetry entitled “The Gospel of Barbecue.” She prefaced her
reading by explaining to the audience that for a short period she
discontinued reading the poem “Tuscaloosa River Song” because
of the repetition of the name of Tuscaloosa, which is considered
disrespectful in Native American culture. However, after receiv-
ing a vision of Tuscaloosa himself giving her permission, she felt
called to continue reading his story.

Once Jeffers began to read her poem, the audience was hyp-
notized by the power and the emotion of her reading. Her style of
poetry is at once musical, rhythmic, enchanting, intimidating, and
fascinating. In between poems, Jeffers herself admitted that her
poetry often makes people “feel sad.”

However, as she put it, “I don’t do humorist poetry. . .it doesn’t
hurt my feelings when people say it’s sad.” Despite the serious
nature of her poetry, Jeffers was an engaging performer, joking
and laughing with the audience as well as taking requests.

Jeffers later read a selection of poems from the perspectives
of the Old Testament ﬁgures Abraham, Sarah, Hagar, and Lot’s
wife. The latter poem in particular stood out as a challenging,
deep, and poignant piece by simultaneously narrating the story of
Sodom and Gomorrah while also capture the intensely emotional
character of Lot’s wife.

To conclude her reading, Jeffers ﬁnished with three poems fo-
cusing on Native American culture and life. She connected her
personal genealogy and her current residence in Oklahoma as well
as a vision of her ancestor who demanded to be remembered.

The third of these poems, which had been requested earlier by
junior Lucy Hundley, was dedicated to a former student of Jef-
fers’ who was a Sun Dancer in his tribe. The ritual of Sun Danc-
ing, Jeffers said, is an annual spiritual celebration of the earth in
which men are able to honor the pain of women in childbirth. The
ritual is extremely physically demanding, yet the Sun Dancers
claim that, when they are connected with the spirit moving them
to dance, they are unable to feel the pain at all.

After the reading had ﬁnished, sophomore Carson Haddow
described the reading as “interesting, engaging...dramatic, but
not overdramatic.” '

He added that he was impressed by the way in which the poet
highlighted the musicality of her verse and the way in which Jef-
fers’ distinctive voice reﬂected her poetry.

Miranda expressed similar sentiments, complimenting Jeffers’
voice and intonation.

“It is always different to‘ watch and see the poet reading” their
work, and “not all poets are good readers, but she [Jeffers] is
good,” she said. '

Ultimately, the entire audience was entranced by Honorée J ef-
fers’ unique style of poetic presentation. She captivated. both the
emotions and the attention of the diverse audience by presenting
her work with energy, sincerity, and incredible skill.

Art students take charge

Students organize, attempt to build arts community

Bywlll Mays

“This building was not con-
structed for the faculty, it was
constructed for you. It was con-
structed for the students, and you
should have a sense of owner-
ship,” Professor George Bent
said with regards to Wilson Hall
on Wednesday.

Bent was addressing a con-
gregation of Washington and
Lee students and professors alike
gathered in Wilson Hall for the
sake of establishing a true arts
community here at W&L.

After elaborating on efforts
made by previous students at
W&L, Bent gave the ﬂoor to his
fellow professors, or “the croco-
diles in the back of the room,” to
pipe in before leaving the class-
room and allowing the students
to voice their suggestions.

Bent was adamant that stu-
dents should lead the front for
any and all efforts made towards
promoting and supporting W&L
arts and improving Wilson Hall.
Furthermore, Professor Gordon
Spice encouraged students to
“think about what isn’t in Wil-
son,” while Rob Mish, the Di-
rector of the Lenfest Center for
the Arts, reminded students that
“When things are done and done
well and are good for the Univer-
sity, they are done by students.”

With a few more words and
suggestions from the faculty, the

“crocodiles” exited and the stu-
dents began a sort of forum for

inaugurating this new society.‘

Students from all facets of the
arts spectrum discussed what
they want and need from Wil-
son Hall to transform the Lenfest
complex into a truly idealized
“arts village."

Students and faculty agreed
that Wilson is an academic cen-
ter and, more importantly, a stu-
dent center, yet the Hall itself is a

bit sterile and uninviting to those

members of the W&L communi-
ty who don’t have classes there.

Students discussed many
ideas to better Wilson and make
it a building in which the whole
community, regardless of their
arts aﬂiliation, would want to
spend time.

Students initially threw
around ideas for a lounge or
hangout in Wilson. The building,
dedicated in October of 2006, is
one of W&L’s newest resources
and is of great value to the arts
community here, yet nearly ev-
eryone involved in the meeting
concurred that the Hall severely
lacks a place for students to meet
and do work.

Many students agreed that
Wilson’s isolation and distance
from the rest of campus only em-
phasizes the fact that it needs a
better place for students to con-
gregate than the existing atri-
um. With the idea of something

“Starbucksy” in mind, students
couldn’t stress enough that a
lounge in the vein of a true cof-
fee shop would not only provide
people with a place to meet, but
it would also be a great resource
to those in search of food or caf-

“This building was

not constructed for

the faculty...It was
constructed for the
students, and you
should have a sense of

ownership. ”

George Bent, Professor of Art
Hlstory
 
feine who don’t want to make
the long hike across campus to
the Co-op. Many students also
seemed content with, if nothing
else, couches and a coffee kiosk
similar to those in the Leybum
Library.

While still discussing Wil-
son, students lamented the fact
that there wasn’t an ideal place
to study or otherwise do work in
the Hall. There are many exist-

ing computer labs in Wilson, yet
students noted that these labs are
usually to be used exclusively
by students in certain ﬁelds of
the arts. With these labs being
opened to all students, the con-
gregation noted Wilson could be
a good alternative to Leybum for
doing work.

The meeting was called to
discuss Wilson Hall, but its other
purpose was to establish a new
society to promote and foster the
arts outside of Wilson. Students
agreed that, in general, such
promotion as posters and cal-
endars should be better utilized
and placed in very visible loca-
tions around campus while also
possibly extending promotion to
such online sources as email and
Facebook.

Also, the ideas of an Arts Fes-
tival, student critique nights, a
newsletter, and the possibility of
tying the Art department to other
departments on campus were met
with much approval by the gath-
ering.

On the whole, the gather-
ing was intent on establishing
a sense of an Arts community
at W&L and getting the school
excited about the Arts. Meetings
will be held in Wilson weekly on
Wednesdays for all those inter-
ested.

Football wins first ODAC game

Defense steps up in 28-16 win over Randolph-Macon

By Brlan Devlne
STAFF WRITER

The new Wilson Field is
proving quickly to be a stage
for the dramatic. In the football
opener at the new venue two
weeks ago, Washington and
Lee beat Southern Virginia in
the ﬁrst game ever between the
two local rivals.

This time the occasion was
Homecoming, with all its asso-
ciated spectacle, and the oppo-
nent was one that the Generals
have come to know very well.
W&L responded beautifully,
opening its conference sched-
ule with a comprehensive 28-16
victory over Randolph-Macon.

The Yellow Jackets have re-
cently been one of the weaker
teams in the Old" Dominion
Athletic Conference, but last
season they shocked every-
one by ﬁnishing second in the
conference after being picked
to ﬁnish last at the start of the
season. i

This year the Yellow Jack-
ets, and their dynamic tailback
Zak Thornton, would sneak up
on nobody. Thornton was the
conference’s leading rusher last
year and easily R-MC’s most
important player.

When asked before the game
how he intended to stop the vis-
itors’ otfensive talisman, Gen-
erals’ head coach Frank Miri-

    

ello said, “We’ve faced some
good running backs the last few
weeks. We’ll be ﬁne.”

And true to their coach’s
word, the Generals’ defense
held Thornton to his worst per-
formance in a season that'has
already started to go wrong for
the Jackets -— just 37 yards on
14 carries.

The Yellow Jackets never
held the lead in the contest but
did not elect to rely on their
passing game until the fourth
quarter, when they were already
down 28-3. When they did so,
quarterback Austin Faulkner
was impressive; he ﬁnished just
short of 300 yards passing but
fell two scores short of an im-
possible comeback.

The victory, then, was won
early in the game, on the shoul-
ders of ﬁrst-year quarterback
Charlie Westfal. With the visi-
tors’ defense no doubt plan-
ning to stop W&L’s outstand-
ing rusher Stuart Sitterson,
they seemed unprepared to deal
with the ﬁrst-year signal-caller.

A See your Toyota dealer for details.

Westfal had his best day on the

stat sheet, 127 yards and two
touchdowns through the air plus
87 yards and one touchdown on
the ground. Sitterson turned
in another solid performance,
if not the electrifying display
from two weeks ago. He racked
up 135 yards rushing and the
Generals’ ﬁrst touchdown.

But the biggest credit for
the win has to go to the W&L
defensive front seven. The de-
fensive line pressured Faulkner
all day and plugged the gaps
that Thornton, fundamentally
a “north-south” or “downhill”
runner, needed open to gain
yardage.

Behind them the linebacking
corps was outstanding. Right-
side standout Matt Cassilly had
twelve total tackles, a fumble
recovery, an interception and a
sack.

The entire unit logged 22
tackles and the defense as a
whole limited the Jackets, a run-
ﬁrst team through and through,
to just 92 yards rushing. This
forced R-MC to play catch-
up through the air, when the

Generals’ pass defense proved
much more suspect. Faulkner
threw for two touchdowns, but
needing a third, the Jackets de-
cided to go to the ground game
once again after getting inside
the W&L three yard-line. True
to form, the W&L front seven
stopped four consecutive rushes
up the middle and the Jackets’
momentum was halted.

W&L now emerges with a 4-
lrecord(l-1 in ODAC play) and
have not lost at home in eleven
games. With Randolph-Macon
slipping to 2-3 (1-1 ODAC) the
Generals have to be considered,
along with defending champi-
ons Hampden-Sydney, among
the favorites for this year’s con-
ference crown. But slipping in
the fourth quarter, as they did
this week and last week against
Averett, will not be an option
against a relentless and talented
Tigers team. First, however,
the Generals will travel to our
nation’s capital to face Catholic
University, another weaker con-
ference foe, next Saturday.

Volleyball Wins
two matches

Team beats Mary Washington and
Mary Baldwin in straight games

By Wlll Dorrance
SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee
volleyball team tallied two
more wins Saturday to an
already impressive season.
The Lady Generals beat Mary
Washington 3-0 and Mary
Baldwin 3-0 in the double
header to bring the season’s

. record to 14-4.

W&L’s ﬁrst opponent was
Mary Washington, who entered
the contest with a record of 11-
8. The Eagles fell behind early
and were never able to get back

into the game, losing 25-18, 26-

24, and 25-21.

Junior outside hitter Rachael
Phillips led the Generals in the
early game with 11 kills, but
senior right side Jess Ulrich
was not far behind with nine.
Junior setter Megan Steinhardt
notched 31 assists while junior
libero Kelly Harrison dug 21
balls._

In W&L’s second match of
the Homecoming weekend, the
team faced off against familiar
Mary Baldwin. The Generals
played the Fighting Squirrels
for the second time this season.
The teams’ ﬁrst meeting of the
season was back on Sept. 5 at
the W&L Invitational. W&L
held the upper edge that day,

sweeping Mary Washington
3-0.

Sophomore defensive
specialist Summer Goldberg

thinks that the earlier meeting -

helped prepare the team for
Saturday’s match-up.» “[On
Sept. 5], we thought it was
going to be easy, but we
realized we had to work just as
hard.”

A different day brought the
same result: W&L did not drop
a game, winning 25-21, 25-20,
and 25-10. Ulrich led the team
in this one with 11 kills and
seven digs. Sophomore outside
hitter Marah Schmitz and
senior right side Alex Scaggs
tallied eight and six kills,
respectively. Steinhardt earned
17 assists while sophomore
setter Jenna Finger contributed
1 0.

With the non-conference
victories, the Generals brought
their win streak to four after
dropping four out of six
matches. Next up for W&L is
an ODAC match Tuesday at
6:30 p.m against Lynchburg.
“The wins [Saturday] helped
build our conﬁdence after
having a not-so-great weekend
in Atlanta [Sept. 19-20 at the
Emory Invitational] to get
us ready for Tuesday against
Lynchburg.”

By Lizz Dye
STAFF WRITER

The Generals’ home ﬁeld hockey game
Friday night ended in a stunning 3-2 over-
time victory against the Eastern Mennonite
University Royals.

Down by two goals in the second half,
the Generals rallied back during the last
17 minutes to tie up the score and go into
overtime. Junior captain Sallie Armstrong
scored the game-winning goal just two
minutes into overtime off an assist from
sophomore midﬁelder Emmy Matthews.
It was her ﬁfth of the season.

Armstrong stated, “It was a team effort,
and you could really feel the momentum
change on the ﬁeld. EMU couldn’t keep up
their intensity as we began to dominate the
play.”

Eastern Mennonite took the lead 10
minutes into the ﬁrst half with a goal from
junior midﬁelder Julie Denlinger. EMU
scored again in the second half at the 40:19
mark with a goal from sophomore forward
Katie Cimini.

The tide changed whensSenior forward
and captain Christina Merchant lifted a ball
over the goalie’s head off of a pass from
senior defender and captain Liz Garson to

bring the score to 2-1.

A goal less than 5 minutes later from
junior forward Stephanie Mansey, assisted
by ﬁrst-year forward Christina Benedetti,
tied the game up and took the ODAC bout
into overtime.

Junior defender Grace. McGee would
like to think that Friday’s second-half mo-
mentum will propel the Generals to more
victories. “We fought hard in the second
half, and it paid off. We played our game
and set the bar for the rest of the season~—it
was liberating!”

Armstrong’s clutch goal kept the Gen-
erals undefeated at home and brought the
ﬁeld hockey team to an overall 3-5-0 re-
cord and a 1-1 record in ODAC play.

Garson noted the importance of this
comeback ODAC win. “Beating EMU
was a huge win for us. It was great to prove
to ourselves that we can come from behind
to win a big game.”

Junior goalkeepter Caroline Habliston
had three excellent saves while sopho-

more defender Jennie Norcini came up
with a scrappy defensive save on a corner
for the Generals. Habliston truly saved the
game for the Generals, who were outshot
13-9 by EMU.

Merchant summed up the game: “Fri-

day’s win over EMU was huge for us
since they were ranked ﬁrst in the ODAC.
The energy on the ﬁeld was incredible,
and once we scored, the tide of the game
shifted completely, and EMU was caught
off guard.”

“Once we began playing like a team
and connecting our passes, there was no
hope for EMU,” she added. “Even though
they were still winning at one point, we all
seemed to know that we would do what-
ever it would take to win the game.”

In the second game of the Homecoming
series, W&L faced off against Mary Wash-
ington in a non-conference match-up Sun-
day. The game went scoreless through the
entire ﬁrst half, but the fans saw a sudden
spurt of three goals in ﬁve minutes.

Mary Washington got on the board ﬁrst
with a goal from junior forward Chelsea
Brown, but the Generals responded with a
goal of their own by sophomore forward
Kathy Brown. The tie was shortlived as
junior Sarah Trirnble’s goal handed the
Eagles the lead they never gave up.

The team returns to action Thursday at
7 p.m. against Roanoke.

First-year forward Allie Espina maneuvers the ball around a Randolph-Macon defender Saturday. Espina
scored her seventh goal and added her second assist of the season in the Generals’ 3-0 win.

3 ﬁrst—years score to put team past Randolph-Macon

By Adam cancryn
STAFF WRITER

A relentless attack led by a trio of ﬁrst-
year forwards carried the Washington and
Lee women’s soccer team to a 3-0 win
over Randolph-Macon on Homecoming
weekend.

Despite playing without leading goal-
scorer Ann Van Devender, the Generals
spent the match almost entirely in their
opponent’s territory, peppering the goalie
with a total of 34 shots.

First-year Allie Espina opened the
scoring in the 13"‘ minute, chasing down
a through ball and ﬁring a shot past the
keeper. The goal gives her seven total on
the season, but it was the only time in the
ﬁrst half W&L could ﬁnd the back of the
net. A few unlucky breaks and solid goal-
keeping from the Yellow Jackets’ Mary

Jocelyn kept the game close going into .

halftime.

The Generals came out with energy in
the second half, just missing on a number
of scoring chances. With the ball con-

“[ Coach Cunningham] talk-

ed to us before the game,
and he told us that it is all on
us [ﬁrst-years], basically. ”

Allie Espina, ﬂrst-year forward

stantly around the goalmouth, it was not
long before W&L extended their lead.

Taking a pass from sophomore mid-
ﬁelder Taylor Garrett, ﬁrst-year Kat Barnes
found herself one-on—one with the keeper.
She easily converted her ninth goal of the
year and gave the Generals some breath-
ing room.

Shortly after, ﬁrst-year forward Anne
Masich put the game away. Sitting in
the middle of the 18-yard box, she took a
well-placed cross from Espina and headed
it past the goalie.

For the Generals, it was a dominating
performance but, more importantly, evi-
dence that they could succeed with young
players at key positions.

“It’s rough, it’s hard because they’re
still learning... it’s a big burden for them
to carry, but they’ve got to do it,” head
coach Neil Cunningham said of the re-
sponsibility given to his ﬁrst-year players.

The team consists of 13 ﬁrst-year play-
ers, making up more than half the roster.
With senior captain Van Devender out
with a quad injury, they will be expected
to step up much like they did against Ran-
dolph-Macon.

“He [Coach Cunningham] talked to us
before the game, and he told us that it’s
all on us, basically,” said Espina, who ﬁn-
ished with a goal and an assist.

So far, so good, though, as the win puts
the Generals’ record at 5-1'in the ODAC
and 7-3 overall. W&L will play host to
current ODAC leader Eastern Mennonite
University at 4 pm. on Tuesday.

Merfs soccer crushes ODAC foe

Generals earn second ODAC win in a 4-0 over Randolph-Macon

By Brooke Sutherland
5 TA F F W R IT E R

Washington and Lee’s men’s soccer
team complemented the H+omecoming
spirit this weekend with a 4-0 victory over
Randolph-Macon.

From start to ﬁnish, the Yellow Jackets
just couldn’t keep up with the Generals.
W&L overcame a slow start at the begin-
ning of the ﬁrst half to take the lead with
a goal by senior midﬁelder Tommy Pig-
natelli. Pignatelli later added an assist on a
goal by junior midﬁelder Drew Crowley.

“It was great to get that ﬁrst goal on
Homecoming weekend,” Pignatelli said.
“With the assist, I was happy because I
felt like we were putting the game away.”

The Generals completely dominated
the second half, cashing in on goals by
junior defender Ted Grover and senior
forward Whitt Larkin to round out the
victory.

The game was truly a team effort, how-
ever, and Washington and Lee’s defense
was phenomenal in the shut-out.

“Defensively, I think we’re really
starting to lock it down,” said ﬁrst-year
defender Stiles Harper. “We’ve got a new
formation, and I think you are going to
start seeing a lot more shut-outs in the
games to come.”

Head coach Rolf Piranian said he was

savoring the solid win after some battles
earlier in the season.

“This was big,” he said. “We were a
little worried about the match-up. We
thought it was going to be a tight game.
We had a very average ﬁrst half, but then
in the second half, we really stepped it

95

up.
Piranian was especially pleased with

people out, it helps for sure.”

But the game was about more than just
a homecoming victory.

“What was most important to me was
getting that second win in the ODAC,”
Pignatelli said. “I think this is a great win
to propel us through the next couple of
games.”

Piranian added, “We were stuck in the

the efforts of the team’s substitutes. “We
used our bench and got a lot more players
out on the ﬁeld,” he said. “I think we just
needed more energy and we got that in the
second half with our subs.”

Despite the frenzy of Homecoming
events, the stands were packed with fans
and alumni.

“It was nice to have so many fans out,”
saidPiranian. “Anytime you get that many

showdown.
