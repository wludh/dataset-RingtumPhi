Taking a
snap at the

outdoors

Outing Club hosts W&L
alum Harrison Shull,
nature photographer

By Eleanor Kennedy
STAFF WRITER

The Outing Club hosted Washington and Lee
class of 1993 alum Harrison Shull last Wednes-
day. Shull is one of the premier outdoor adven-
ture photographers in the southeast United States.
Shull presented a slideshow of approximately 150
images, telling stories of where and why he took
the various pictures and how some of the images
were created.

Shull attended Washington and Lee from 1989
to 1993. While a student, Shull escaped the con-
ﬁnes of Lexington to ﬁnd climbing, hiking, raft-

“I absolutely abhor standing on
the ground and taking normal
pictures. I am always looking for
ways to change the perspective. ”

Harrison Shull, W&L ‘93 alum
 

ing and other outdoor activities throughout the
neighboring areas.

Upon graduation, Shull thought he would take
a year or two off to be a climbing guide before at-
tending grad school. But his grandmother bought
him his ﬁrst real camera for graduation and he
“never made it to grad school.” He spent six years
as a climbing guide before moving into the world
of photography full-time. There are now over
175,000 images in Shull’s ﬁles.

Shull now runs his own photography com-
pany, Shull Photo. He spends most of his time
traveling around the southeastern United States,
trying to capture exciting images that advertisers
and magazine writers might want to use in the fu-
ture. Most of Shull’s work is stock images that
a few different agencies distribute for him. For
example, when a sporting magazine wanted to do
a feature on camping on the Appalachian Trail,
the producers simply looked through the hundred
or so images that Shull has in stock of campers on
the trail and chose one for their cover.

Shull will sometimes do assignments for mag-
azines but spends most of his time carrying his
camera around while outside, looking for some-
thing that might be useful.

“I take my camera everywhere. You never
know what you’re going to ﬁnd,” Shull said.

The shots in Shull’s slideshow ranged from
pictures of Shull and his buddies rock climbing to
two extremely talented mountain unicyclers, but
they also captured the beauty of nature, such as
in a shot of the sun’s beams beginning to peak
through the clouds over North Carolina. When it
comes to shots like those, Shull admits that some-
times “it’s better to be lucky than good.”

Shull’s show also had a great number of shots
with his Labrador, since “nothing sells a picture
like a dog.”

Very few of the pictures in Shull’s show could
be classiﬁed as “standard” or “boring” by any
means. Shull is fascinated by capturing motion
and often uses specialized zooms or attaches a
camera to a moving bike or motorcycle in order
to convey motion. In addition, it is not unusual to
look at one of Shull’s photos and realize that the
image was taken while hanging of a tree or a cliff
or with the camera buried or hidden under water.

“I absolutely abhor standing on the ground and
taking normal pictures,” he said. “I am always
looking for ways to change the perspective.”

Sexual assault, student govern-
ment transparency and the deﬁnition
of honor were among the primary
issues discussed at probably the
ﬁrst-ever student body meeting last
Monday, but students also brought
up everything from voting proce-
dures to Traveller and the speaking
tradition.

The meeting was called by EC
president Eric Hoffman after over
100 students signed a petition last
term. Seniors Anthony Ives and Re-
gina Mills decided to start the peti-
tion when they read about e-mails
Hoffman had sent during his cam-

\

paign for president.

The meeting was held in the War-
ner Center and lasted for two and a
half hours.

Not nearly enough people attend-
ed the meeting to be able to make
amendments to the White Book, but
students still had the chance to ask
questions to the EC. Suggestions
were made for future elections to po-
tentially change the White Book and
Student Body Constitution.

Hoffman gave an opening state-
ment in which he offered an expla-
nation of the e-mails that appeared
in the Ring-tum Phi on March 30. He
sent these e-mails shortly before the
run-off election for EC president. He
admitted he was careless and should

have used different words.

the Student Bar Association (SBA)
should receive more money from

As for his e-mail message stat-
ing the EC should be ﬁlled with

intended to suggest that undergradu-
ates are not qualiﬁed, though he
did say that law students are better

all sides of an issue.

Expanding to Roanoke

W&L Law students gain experience in their career ﬁeld

By Anne Vesoulls
STA F F W R IT E R

It seems as though Oliver Hill’s
legacy is already having an impact
on how Washington and Lee law stu-
dents and Roanoke area lawyers are
helping the community.

May 1 marked the official launch
of the Washington and Lee Com-
munity Law Center in Roanoke. The
Law Center is located at the newly
renovated childhood home of civil
rights lawyer Oliver Hill.

The open house brought in over
100 people to tour the facility, learn
about its mission and hear a number
of speakers. Among those present
were Esther Vassar, president of the
Oliver Hill Foundation; Roanoke
Mayor David Bowers and W&L
Law Dean Rodney Smolla.

The home was made available to
the Law Center by the Oliver Hill
Foundation, an organization dedi-
cated to carrying on Hill’s work in
the ﬁeld of civil rights.

The Oliver Hill Foundation not
only assists the community, but also

strives to assist young lawyers to ob-
tain public service experience and
provides ﬁnancial incentives and aid
to young lawyers who would oth-
erwise not be able to achieve their
goals.

The Community Center focuses

“We have had lots of
success...we are just
seeing the beginning of

the bubble. ”

Mary Natkin, W&L Law asst.
dean of cllnlcal education

on helping the Roanoke community
by providing legal assistance to its
citizens. It has been providing pro
bono—free—legal services to those
in need in an attempt to assist the im-
poverished.

The center has been assisting the
elderly since last fall with ﬁnal docu-
ments and other paperwork.

“We are currently helping the
elderly population of Roanoke with
advanced medical directives, living
wills and naming powers of attorney.
We are also helping them to create
wills,” said Howard Highland, W&L
Law graduate and live-in center per-
sonnel.

Since January, two new types of
assistance have become available:
an ex-offender program and an im-
migration program.

There are currently two immigra-
tion cases with which the center is
assisting.

The ex-offender program helps
ex-felons to reinstate their voting
rights.

“There is a clause in Virginia law
that disenfranchises convicted felons
of the right to vote. In order to gain
that right back, attorney assistance is
helpful,” said Highland.

Highland also said that this ex-
offender program directly applies to
Hill’s mission: civil rights.

Oliver Hill was an attorney during
the Civil Rights movement. He was

one of the ﬁve lawyers to argue in
the 1954 Brown v. Board of Educa-
tion decision which declared school
segregation illegal. A graduate of
Howard University and Howard
Law School, Hill received an honor-
ary law degree from Washington and
Lee in 2000.

“Hill is truly an inspiration,” said
Highland.

As news of the center spreads,
more and more people are seeking
the assistance of the law students.

“We have taken a few referrals
and have six or seven clients al-
ready,” said Mary Natkin, assistant
dean for clinical education and pub-
lic service at W&L Law. “We have
had lots of success. . .we are just see-
ing the beginning of the bubble.”

Washington and Lee Law stu-
dents will be working in conjunction
with Roanoke lawyers to provide
services to those in need.

“It is the dream of the center to
have lawyers and law students to
work together to help the community
in the Hill House,” said Highland.

Answering the local tummy growls ‘

RARA, Campus Kitchens and W&L collaborate to ﬁght against local hunger

By Jessica Stralt
STAFF WRITER

Cheez—it boxes, cereal, canned

food, oatmeal cream pies, maca- .

roni and cheese, snacks, cookies,
Past-A-Roni and seemingly nev-
er—ending bags of potatoes ﬁll the
rooms of the Rockbridge Area
Relief Association food pantry,
overﬂowing into the halls.

RARA is on the brink of run-
ning out of space. And if the
number of food-needy families
and individuals in the area con-
tinues to climb as the economy
spirals downward, it’s only a
matter of time.

RARA, which opened in
1972, provides non-perishable
food to local people in need.
The food pantry is a tiny build-
ing, and if you aren’t looking for
RARA, you’ll probably drive
right by without noticing.

To create more storage space,
a collaboration is underway bring
together Washington and Lee
University, RARA and Campus
Kitchens, according to visiting
education professor Don Dailey,
who is involved with the project
and W&L’s Shepherd Poverty
Program.

The project will include stu-
dents and faculty predicting fu-
ture needs and researching pos-
sible ways to coordinate with

food services in other commu-
nities. The project also hopes to
convene local leaders in a series
of forums to raise awareness of
the hunger issue. Volunteer Lynn
McCoy mentioned the possibil-
ity of a retired architect coming
on board with the project to see
if the interior of the building,
which used to be the site of the
Free Clinic, can be somehow re-
designed to better suit RARA’s
needs.

The project is still in begin-
ning stages, and right now the
focus is on bringing different
voices into the discussion. Dai-
ley also mentioned the possibil-
ity of integrating food services or
setting up satellite food pantries
in different locations as ways to
alleviate the problem. The proj-
ect presents an opportunity for
collective problem solving in the
community.

Although RARA currently
operates out of a small building,
the pantry still manages to do big
things. From 2005 to 2007, the
number of food packages served
remained stable, around 7,500
packages.

In 2008, RARA experienced
a 30 percent hike in demand,
serving 10,956 food packages.
RARA workers try to always
have a one-month supply of food

in their pantry, where they also
store the food that volunteers de-
liver monthly.

“In a survey we conducted
two years ago, hunger and food
security were not seen as critical
in the community,” said Dailey.
“Since the economic downturn,

tions that bring the local poverty
issue to light. According to Mc-
Coy, many people see Lexing-
ton as an aﬂluent area and never
know that these people are in this
community.

“It really opened my eyes,”
said McCoy. “Stuff you see on

“It really opened my eyes. Stuff you see on TV

is hapenning right here, right now. ’

I

 

hunger has emerged as a critical
issue that is expanding beyond
local capacity.”

Professor Harlan Beckley,
Director of W&L’s Shepherd
Poverty Program, also attributes
the problem to the economy,
which has similarly affected the
demand for other service needs
in the area, such as Rockbridge
Area Transportation Services
programs and the Free Clinic.

Lynn McCoy, a 56-year-old
retired Lexington man, first vol-
unteered at RARA when some
friends from his church invited
him to join their team. That was
almost a year ago, and in that
time McCoy has witnessed situa-

TV is happening right here, right
now.”

He described one particular
instance about a month ago. A
man who couldn’t afford a car
rode his bike seven miles from
his home just to pick up a few
bags of food. When he was hav-
ing trouble balancing his bags on
his bike, McCoy offered to drive
him to his home.

He recalled how the man,
who had recently been laid off
from his job as a truck driver,
kept insisting that the situation
was temporary, and that he felt
guilty for needing the food.

“That’s what we’re here for:
to help until people get back on

their feet,” said McCoy, with a
kind, crinkly smile.

The problem is all too com-
mon, especially recently. Most
people who come in to RARA
are unemployed, but some have
low-paying jobs, and others are
simply unable to work. Accord-
ing to McCoy, there have been
many layoffs lately at local
plants.

However, among the eco-
nomic struggles, there may be a
silver lining. It seems that people
are more generous in these tough
times~$veryone keeps giving
and helping.

“The community is so sup-
portive,” said McCoy. “If funds
run low, people help.”

Some also donate their time——
ﬁve to six volunteers come in
every Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday from 3 to 4 p.m. to help
hand out food, which comes from
the Blue Ridge Area Food Bank,
local food drives, churches, and
individuals.

RARA checks visitors every
January and July to make sure
they qualify to receive food, but
according to McCoy, “most eas-
ily qualify.” The amount of food
they receive depends on the size
of the family in need, and ev-
eryone is allotted one visit per
month.

For now, there seems to be
no end in sight for the recession.
Beckley suggested several local
and federal initiatives that would
alleviate the increased need in
Rockbridge county: public trans-
portation in the area, increased
money available for food stamps
and universal health insurance.

Yet, despite the state of the
economy, McCoy, said there is
always going to be a need in the
area.

And whether or not RARA
relocates, renovates, or stays ex-
actly the same, rest assured that
enough people will always be
there to lend a hand.

“We serve a lot of people,”
said McCoy. “The volunteers
make it go.”

Oil billionaire calls for alternatives

T Boone Pickens speaks out for newer, cleaner energy resources for the nation

By Dlandra Splcak
NEWS EDITOR

Oil billionaire and philanthro-
pist T. Boone Pickens, an out-
spoken advocate for alternative
energy, spoke at Lee Chapel on
Thursday, April 28.

Washington and Lee’s Con-
tact Committee sponsored his
visit.

As the founder and chairman
of BP Capital Management, one
of the nation’s most success-
ful energy-oriented investment
funds, the 80-year-old Pickens
has garnered the reputation of the
“Oracle of Oil” for his accurate
predictions of oil and gas prices.

His speech detailed how
Americans can wean themselves
from foreign oil and reign in
abundant natural resources like
natural gas. Armed with a white
board and dry erase marker, Pick-
ens drew pie charts accompanied
by ﬁgures showing Americans’
use of foreign oil and other en-
ergy resources.

Drawing on his status as one

Student Body

opinions. “If other EC members
disagree with me, there are l0
other votes to do so,” he said.

Hoffman also responded to
the claim that he ran two dif-
ferent campaigns in gaining the
votes of undergraduates and law
students, saying the EC has obli-
gations to both sides of campus.
“It’s not an ‘us versus them’ situ-
ation,” he said. “I care about the
university as a whole.”

He then spoke about sexual
assault in relation to the honor
system, asserting that it is an act
that goes against the communi-
ty’s trust. But he emphasized that
it is a sensitive issue that must be
treated with care. He explained
that the Student-Faculty Hearing
Board (SF HB) was created by
the EC for this purpose.

Much of the subsequent dis-

of the most inﬂuential business-
men in history, Pickens compared
American dependency on foreign
oil to international dependency,
citing a story of how the Chinese
tried to tap into their natural gas
reserves, only to ﬁnd they had no
lines from their ﬁelds. America,
on the other hand, has many nat-
ural gas fields which run from
Appalachia to Texas, and even
into Colorado, Wyoming and
Alaska.

In July 2008, Pickens put
into action an ambitious and
completely self-funded grass-
roots campaign aimed at reduc-
ing America’s dependence on
imported oil. He has launched
a national television ad cam-
paign, and with personal appear-
ances and his Web site, he argues
that the nation’s dependence on
foreign oil poses threats to the
economy, the environment and
national security.

“I had the opportunity to talk
to both of the presidential candi-
dates before the election,” Picken

cussion focused on sexual as-
sault and the SFHB. Several stu-
dents expressed concern that the
function of the SFHB is confus-
ing, or that sexual assault should
be considered an honor violation
and fall under the jurisdiction of
the EC.

Former EC president Rich
Cleary said that the EC ’s proce-
dure for honor investigations is
not designed for the sensitive na-
ture of sexual assault, while the
SFHB can better dedicate itself
to protecting these cases.

Hoffman added that the
SFHB allows faculty members
to be involved in these cases,
and it avoids the possibility of
having a sexual assault case go
to an open hearing, which could
happen if the EC handled these
cases. Also, the SFHB does not
have a single-sanction policy for
non-rape cases.

Allison Gionta and Patrick
Rowe, students on the SFHB,

said. “Neither of the senators had
any idea or clue about energy
— if they had been given an en-
ergy test, they both would have
failed...But once I brought up
my plan to them and spoke about
reducing our dependency on for-
eign oil, they both seemed very

had become the new generation’s
responsibility to join his “army.”
He went on to explain to the au-
dience members that by joining
the Pickens plan, each and every
one of the members had a duty to
advocate alternative resources.
Pickens focused mainly on

“I see the need to cut down on foreign depen-

dency. We need that now, and [natural gas] is

the fastest way to get there. ’

J

T. Boone Pickens, oll billionaire and philanthropist
 

interested.”

The Pickens Plan, which has
more than a million supporters,
calls for wind generation facili-
ties to produce 20 percent of the
nation’s electricity and for natu-
ral gas to fuel vehicles.

Throughout his speech, Pick-
ens pushed home the idea that it

stressed that protecting the ac-
cusers and the accused in these
cases is extremely important and
that not every case can be han-
dled in the same way. Gionta did
admit, however, that not enough
dialogue exists between the
SFHB and other groups on cam-
pus. The board is in the process
of re-evaluating some of their
procedures, she said.

Several students who stood
up to ask a question still asserted
that they do not understand what
the SFHB actually does.

Some asked why sexual as-
sault is not mentioned in the
White Book, which details the
honor system. Cleary said the
White Book must be kept open-
ended since the honor system can
be redeﬁned by later generations
of students. He also said it is im-
portant to distinguish between
the White Book and the Student
Handbook, which includes more
far-reaching aspects of student

reigning in the uses of natural
gas, although he has become
well known for advocating wind
energy. When confronted about
why he pushed natural gas so
much, Pickens responded that
“while wind energy is mainly my
focus, I see the need to cut down
on foreign dependency. We need

life.

Senior Chris Martin asked if
the single-sanction policy should
perhaps be reconsidered for the
entire honor system.

Hofﬁnan said he is commit-
ted to this policy, believing it
makes the university’s system
one of the most successful honor
systems in the country.

“No breach of the commu-
nity’s trust is too small to be
ignored,” he said. “That’s our
stand.”

Jordan Wilson, Class of 2011
EC representative, said he is not
opposed to a student body vote
on the single-sanction policy, but
the other EC members expressed
their support for keeping the
policy.

As for why the SFHB does
not have the same policy, Dean
Dawn Watkins came forward
to say that fewer cases would
be reported or would receive a
guilty sentence if expulsion were

that now, and [natural gas] is the
fastest way to get there. We still
haven’t ﬁgured out how to con-
vert wind energy into powering
vehicles.”

In his 2008 book, “The First
Billion is the Hardest,” which
was available at the reception in
the Science Center’s Great Hall
after his speech, Pickens outlines
what the country must do to win
back its energy independence.
Pickens also pursues a wide range
of other business interests, rang-
ing from water marketing, wind
power and ranch development
initiatives to his company, Clean
Energy. Clean Energy, which
went public in 2007, works to
advance the use of natural gas as
a cleaner-burning and more cost-
effective transportation fuel al-
ternative to gasoline and diesel.

Pickens graduated with a de-
gree in geology from Oklahoma
A&M (now Oklahoma State Uni-
versity) in 1951. He has always
been a generous philanthropist,
donating more than $600 million

the only possible penalty. “The
chance of conviction diminishes
greatly with single-sanction,”
she said.

Students also posed sugges-
tions to improve voter turnout
and awareness of elections, such
as implementing online voting.

EC Vice President Scott Cen-
torino also emphasized personal
responsibility in seeking infor-
mation about EC candidates and
elections and making informed
decisions.

“If we don’t tell you our plat-
form, don’t vote for us,” he said.

Concerned with transparency
and the overall effectiveness of
the EC, Ives suggested the addi-
tion of two non-voting members
of the EC. These would include
a chair, separate from the presi-
dent, who would run meetings
and a historian to keep track of
the votes of each member.

Changes to Traveller were
also discussed, such as whether

through his lifetime.

The T. Boone Pickens Foun-
dation is focused on improving
lives through grants support-
ing things such as educational
programs, medical research and
conservation and wildlife initia-
tives.

The recipient of dozens of
major awards, Pickens receieved
the 2006 Horatio Alger Award
from The Horatio Alger Associa-
tion of Distinguished Americans
Inc. The award honors those who
overcome adversity and humble
beginnings to achieve success.

Although offered an hono-
rarium by the Contact Commit-
tee, Pickens donated the money
to charity. As a sprightly, elderly
man, he still plans to continue
his self-funded plan and push for
America’s self-contained energy
use.

the ﬁve-mile radius rule for Trav-
eller Dispatch should continue.
Kenneth Hopkins, Class of 2010
EC representative and Traveller
Dispatch Coordinator, pointed
out that the EC and Traveller are
separate, though he is open to
having a conversation involving
the entire school community.
Many still long for a clearer
deﬁnition of the honor system,
especially in regard to sexual as-
sault cases, but students in atten-
dance at the meeting welcomed
the opportunity to speak openly
before the EC about their ideas.

Stop the Boy Scouts

Boy Scouts of America wants to move a 40—k person
campout to the area around Goshen. Bad idea.

By Cody Beauchamp
OPINIONS EDITOR

Before I write anything else, I should say
that I am now and always will be a proud
Boy Scout.

My father is an Eagle Scout, the highest
rank any Boy Scout can achieve. I am also a
proud Eagle Scout, as is my little brother.

Between the three of us, we have spent
literally thousands of nights camping, hiked
hundreds of miles and spent years being ac-
tive in the Scouts.

Between the three of us, we have also
attended six Boy Scout National Jamborees
— my father in 1973, 2001, and 2005. I went
with him in 2001, and my brother joined
both of us in 2005.

So, to put it simply, Scouting and attend-
ing the quadrennial Scout Jamborees run
deep in my family.

The two J amborees I attended were, with-
out doubt, highlights of my time as a Scout,
surpassed only by those last few months
when I ﬁnally earned my Eagle Scout rank.

Why am I saying all this? Because I feel
the need to establish some credibility before
I write the following — the Boy Scouts of
America (BSA) is about to make a horrible
decision concerning their Jamborees.

In case you have no idea what a J ambe-
ree is, other than a funny, dorky sounding
word, allow me to ﬁll you in.

Every four years since 1937, the Boy
Scouts of America have held a giant gath-
ering and campout for thousands of Scouts.
And when I say giant, I mean giant.

The last Jamboree was held in 2005 on
the grounds of Ft. A.P. Hill, near Bowling
Green, Va.

The oﬁicial attendance count from the
BSA is 37,500 Scouts and Scouters (mean-
ing, usually, fathers who are adult leaders).

But I suspect that number does not in-
clude the thousands of staffers for that Jam-
boree, who did everything from teach merit
badges to run what was essentially a tem-
porary city.

Imagine if you will a tent city that springs
up basically overnight — roughly 40,000
people, all camping on the same few hun-
dred acres, all staying there for about two
weeks.

The Jamboree is essentially a fully devel-
oped city. Each one has a hospital and clinic
system which can treat everything from a 14
year-old with a hiking blister to a 50 year-
old adult leader going in cardiac arrest.

Each one has a police force. No kidding.

There is also a public transportation
system, a network of buses that transports
thousands of Scouts over hundreds of miles
of routes from one end of the camp to the
other, every day.

What’s amazing is that, in my experi-
ence, the buses were more reliable than, say,
the London Tube or the DC Metro ever have
been.

There are ﬁre stations with fully op-
erational engines — not just Scouts forming
bucket chains.

There are sanitation systems that run
dozens of garbage trucks that have to deal
with tons of waste everyday.

There are temporary telephone networks.
There are temporary radio stations and
newspapers. There is a catering staff that
has to feed thousands of staffers, in dozens
of mess halls.

There is an opening and a closing arena
show for the entire Jamboree that employs
dozens of professional bands and acts, and
the closing show’s ﬁreworks display is one
of the best I’ve ever seen.

It is a huge deal, and here’s what’s trou-
bling — for its 2013 Jamboree, the BSA wants
to move the event to their Goshen Scout
Reservation here in Rockbridge County.

Right now, this is the single most ludi-
crous idea I’ve ever heard. The Boy Scouts
want to hold a massive multi-week camp
that requires extremely complex logistics at
a camp in the Goshen area.

Have you been to Goshen lately? That
area cannot support the National Jamboree

. as it is.

Most of the roads in that area of Rock-

: bridge County are one-lane each way. They
 are poor quality on top of that, with tons
3 of blind corners and almost no shoulders.
‘I There are steep cliffs next to most of the
roads, falling off into the Maury.

Are you telling me that the thousands of

shuttles that will transport roughly 40,000
Scouts to the Jamboree site can safely use
those roads? What about the hundreds of
delivery trucks that will have to make daily
trips to transport tons of food? What about
the other hundreds of trucks hauling off
40,000 people’s tons of waste?

Or think about the electric aspect of
things. Even though Scouts camp without
electricity in their sites, there are hundreds
of apsetcs of a Jamboree that require an
electric grid.

The tons of food distributed on a daily
basis have to be refrigerated. The multiple
fully functioning hospitals and clinics have
to have power, as do the computers in the
command tents that coordinate the buses,
sanitation crews, security, etc.

And those are just the few things I can
think of off the top of my head. There are

environment. Take it from me, someone
who has spent hundreds of nights camping
in all kinds of terrain and conditions.

It is impossible to truly camp without
leaving some kind of trace, some kind of
footprint. It is just as impossible for 40,000
people to camp without signiﬁcantly chang-
ing that area.

Right now that’s not a problem the Jam-
boree has — it’s located on a military base.

The military exercises and training ac-
tivities that makes up Fort A.P. Hill’s non-
Jamboree schedule impact the environment
far more than the Jamboree does.

But it’s different for Goshen. Drop
40,000 people down there for a week, and
the area will never look the same after-
wards.

If this happens, the last W&L students
who will be able to enjoy beautiful, unique

Most W&L students are only passing through Rockbridge

[Co.]. But...we enjoy Goshen and the Maury as much as any

native. We, like the permanent residents of this county, love

and beneﬁt from this wonderful area of the river... We have a

duty to make sure this beautiful little area isn ’t destroyed.

doubtless hundreds of other areas that re-
quire electricity ~ are you telling me the
utilities network in the Rockbridge County
countryside can handle that kind of demand
as is? Not a chance.

And then there’s the massive overhaul
for the water networks in the area — 40,000
people showering, cooking and cleaning ev-
ery day requires a lot of water.

My point is this — right now, the area and
towns around Goshen do not have the infra-
structure to handle the National Jamboree.

Unlike its current location — the Army
base at Fort A.P. Hill — the logistical de-
mands of getting 40,000 people in the
same are cannot be met by our neck of the
woods.

This is precisely why this is a bad idea,
both for the Scouts and more importantly
for anyone who cares about the Goshen area
or Rockbridge County.

A group protesting the Boy Scouts’ deci-
sion — the Friends of the Maury — has pointed
out, quite correctly, that most of the costs for
overhauling the Goshen area will be shoul-
dered by Virginians and more speciﬁcally
the good people of Rockbridge County.

We as W&L students don’t really have to
worry about that aspect of this whole ordeal.
Except for the few of us who are Rockbridge
born-and-bred (which I’m not), our tax dol-
lars won’t be going to pay for anything.

But just because we aren’t going to feel
the effects of the Jamboree in our taxes
doesn’t mean we won’t be affected.

Most W&L students are only passing
through Rockbridge. But for the four years
we’re here, we enjoy Goshen and the Maury
as much as any native. We, like the penna-
nent residents of this county, love and ben-
eﬁt from this wonderful area of the river.

If we fail to voice our displeasure with
the BSA’s decision, we might be the last
generation of students that are truly able to
enjoy Goshen.

The reason is because the type of extreme
overhaul the Jamboree will require will al-
most certainly destroy Goshen as we know
it. This part of the Maury will be irreparably
changed. I’d bet my Eagle badge on it.

There is no way on God’s green earth that
you can infuse 40,000 people into the Rock-
bridge County countryside without millions
of dollars worth of new and improved roads.
These roads will take up more space, and I
don’t see any way they can be constructed
without severely damaging the fragile eco-
system around here.

There’s also no way you can convince me
that having 40,000 teenagers suddenly liv-
ing so close to the Maury won’t ruin it. Boy
Scouts aim to be environmentally friendly,
yes, but the thing about being a Scout is that
it’s a learning process.

Even the best Boy Scouts don’t camp
without leaving some kind of trace, without
in some small way placing stress upon the

Goshen will be the students here spring
2013. After that, it will never be the same.

So what can we do? How in the heck do
you attack the Boy Scouts without looking
completely ridiculous? They’re Boy Scouts
for crying out loud!

The problem isn’t the Scouts — like I’ve
said, it’s a phenomenal experience, and an
organization I’m proud to have been in.

The problem is, rather, the location. The
BSA simply didn’t pick a good one.

Luckily, there is still time for all of us
and all of the residents of Rockbridge Coun-
ty to let them know that.

I’m willing to bet that if the considerable
braid power W&L has housed in its ecolo-
gy, environmental studies, and other science
classes turned their attention towards ex-
plaining to the public and the Scouts what is
negative about this decision, it would have
an impact.

I’m willing to bet that if those brilliant
law students interested in helping the local
communities through free clinics lent their
talents toward helping the seemingly inevi-
table lawsuit against the Scouts, it would
have an impact.

I’m willing to bet that if the many law-
makers and politicians to whom we as a stu-
dent body are connected suddenly noticed
that this issue needs further public debate, it
would have an impact.

I’m especially willing to bet that if
enough students joined the Friends of the
Maury, we could do a lot to help them save
and protect this beautiful area from a well-
intentioned but sure-to-be-bad decision.

So check it out. Give wvvw.savegosh-
enpass.com a look. Go to the public infor-
mation meetings they’re having. If you’re
a Boy Scout, or an Eagle Scout, join me in
letting the Scouts know Goshen is a horrible
site for the Jamboree.

I’m sure I’m not the only person at W&L
who went to a Jamboree and realizes what
kind of strain that would put on Goshen.

I’m sure I’m not the only person who
thinks that before they start signiﬁcantly
changing our beloved countryside, the
Scouts needs to defend its decisions.

Unless my personal plans radically
change, I won’t even be living in Virginia in
2013. My Goshen days will be long gone.

Doesn’t matter, for me or for any of us.
We have a duty to make sure this beautiful
little area isn’t destroyed. We have to be-
come interested in this debate.

We have to help our neighbors protect
the Maury and Goshen before we graduate,
because we love it and beneﬁt from it as
much as they do.

We have to be interested in protecting
Goshen now, or it may not be there when
we come back as alumni.

Now that would be a tragedy.

Katie Gardner, the center’s curato-

their parents to this quiet corner of
campus more often, or just take a mo-
ment on their own to see the valuable
pieces.

“It’s supposed to be a nice tasting

she said hinting at the value of the event
as practice for the real world.

W&L rowing hosts Albert Sidney-Harry Lee Regatta for second straight year

By Megan Dally
snxrr warren

At Washington and Lee ’s Alumni
Weekend out at the pole houses, stu-
dents and alumni were treated to the
Albert Sidney-Harry Lee Regatta
for the second consecutive year. The
Harry Lee boat won this year’s race
on May 2.

After a more than ﬁfty-year hia-
tus, Generals’ crew is back. Rowing
is W&L’s oldest sport; it was the
foundation of the athletic program
until the 1950s.

The Albert Sidney-Harry Lee
Race took place along the same
stretch of the Maury River that the
club practices and races these days.
Back in the day, the race consisted of
two six oared barges with coxswains.
As they rowed down the river, canal
boats would be ﬁlled with spectators
with the University’s colors.

The rowing team continued to
function into the 20th century and
competed aggressively with many of
the nation’s top teams. As the rowing
program grew in prestige, the Albert
Sidney-Harry Lee Race became one
of W&L’s most anticipated spring
athletic events.

However, with the start of the
Second World War, the rowing team
and the race were discontinued. Af-

ter the conclusion of the war, with
the help of rowing alumni, the club
was resurrected and reached its ze-
nith. W&L beat some of the best
teams in the country including Rut-
gers, Dartmouth and the University
of Pennsylvania. The team, though,
was suspended in the wake of the
great football cheating scandal of

During the 2006-2007 school
year, Parker Sheppard from the
Class of 2008 reestablished W&L’s
rowing club. The program now has
three four-man boats as well as other
top-notch equipment.

On April 25, 2009, W&L raced
the University of Richmond along
the James River, thereby ending its

ﬁfty plus-year absence from inter-
collegiate rowing. The men’s A and
B teams both placed second while
the women’s boat came in third in its
race. W&L and Richmond have been
rowing rivals since the 18905.
Junior co-captain Denis O’Leary
reacted to the club’s Richmond race.
“It’s hard when you are racing ﬁill
Varsity programs. . .. [But] I think the
race was an exceptional milestone to

bring rowing back to W&L.”

In the 2009-2010 season the club
plans to arrange races against Wil-
liam and Mary, Washington College
and Richmond once again while
adding more rowers to the program.

The present-day lineup for the
champion Harry Lee boat included
junior co-captain Grant Russell, ju-
niors F iskow and James Sunderland,
ﬁrst-year Joey Brown, Joanie Hudak,
Matt Simpson and Mihaela Petrova.
The Albert Sidney boat consisted
of O’Leary, junior Samuel Shore,
sophomores Jarrett Brotzman and
Michele Farquharson, and ﬁrst-years
Nathan Naughton, Laura O’Neil and
Lev Raslin.

Farquharson commented on the
current state of the program, “While
we did not do that great in our ﬁrst
competition [against Richmond], the
only way to go from here is up. We
are making strides; we have the ﬁrst
all-female boat in our program’s his-
tory.”

The future for the rowing club
seems to be promising. It hopes to
evolve into a full-ﬂedged Varsity
rowing program. W&L has a strong
rowing heritage, and Lexington’s
waterways are a great home for a
rowing club.

W&L loses to Emory, fails
to make NCAA quarters for
ﬁrst time in 10 seasons

By Will Dorrance
spoms EDITOR

After beating Meredith 5-0 in the second round
of the NCAA tournament Saturday, the nationally
ﬁfth-ranked Washington and Lee women’s tennis
team fell to third-ranked Emory 5-2 Sunday in
the third round.

The Generals end their season at 20-4. It is the
ﬁrst time in 10 years that the team will not ad-
vance at least to the NCAA quarterﬁnals.

In the regular season, Emory had beaten W&L
6-3 on April 17 in Spartanburg, S.C. Entering
Sunday though, assistant coach Elliot Datlow
said the Generals liked their chances.

“We had a bunch of three-set matches last
time we played Emory. We came in [Sunday]
pretty conﬁdent because we have grown a lot
since then.”

Senior captain Katie Tabb spoke of the team’s
preparations for the NCAA tournament. “We
had been training really hard with very intense,
focused practices the week leading up to this
weekend. We also had some individualized work
during practice according to what each person
needed, and lot of girls on the team did additional
sessions with our coaches or each other to help
them prepare.”

W&L did start off strong yesterday winning
two of three doubles matches.
doubles, Tabb and junior Lauren Caire edged
Emory’s Sabra Rogers and Tshema Nash in a tie-
breaker to win 9-8 (7-5). At number two, ﬁrst-
years Ann Moris and Trelsie Sadler lost to Zahra
Dawson and Lorne McManigle. In the ﬁnal dou-
bles spot, senior captain Meg Spalitta and ﬁrst-
year Ellen Yeatman topped the Eagles’ team of
Lindsay Reidenbach and Daniela Schechter 8-2.

The Generals would not have the same success
in their singles matches. Yeatman lost to Dawson
7-5, 0-6, 6-1 in number two singles; Sadler fell
to Nash 6-2, 6-2 at number three; Snyder had a
rough time with Reidenbach in number four sin-
gles, losing 6-1, 6-1; and Spalitta was defeated by
Schechter 6-3, 6-2 on the ﬁfth line.

The four singles wins handed Emory the 5-2
victory. Tabb and Caire did not ﬁnish their ﬁrst
and sixth singles matches, respectively, because
Emory was already declared the winner.

Tabb reacted to the team’s loss. “It’s obvi-
ously very disappointing to lose; who enjoys be-
ing beaten? But I do think that we should also be
very proud.”

Although Datlow was also disappointed with
the result, he commended his players’ efforts.
“The coaches were very pleased with the way
we fought, but the close matches didn’t go our

way.

Against Meredith on Saturday, the Generals
did not face too many problems. At number one
doubles, Tabb and Caire beat Meredith’s Morgan
Martin and Kathryn Maples 8-5 in the closest
match-up of the day. The rest of the Generals’
day proved to be even easier as Morris and Sadler
defeated Brooke Baird and Ashley Pearsall 8-1
while ﬁrst-year Ellen Yeatman and senior captain
Meg Spalitta topped Molly Parks and Caitlin Dil-
lon 8-3 in second and third doubles, respectively.

In singles action, Sadler rolled to a 6-1, 6-1
win over Maples in the three spot, and Spalitta had
little trouble with Dillon at number ﬁve, winning
6-0, 6-1 for the team victory. Numbers one, two,
four and six singles did not ﬁnish their matches
because the Generals had already reached the
necessary ﬁve points to claim the win.

While the team’s season is over, Tabb and
Yeatman qualiﬁed for singles and Tabb and Caire
will play doubles at the NCAA individual cham-
pionships May 22-24 in Lawrenceville, Ga.

Datlow looked back on his ﬁrst year with
W&L. “I loved it. I thought it was a great year.
Every single member grew as a player and an in-
dividual. It was a lot of fun.”

Men is lacrosse beats FD U—Florham, falls to Gettysburg

The nationally sixth-ranked
Washington and Lee men’s lacrosse team
fell to ﬁfth-ranked Gettysburg 15-10 in the
second round of the NCAA tournament
Saturday in Gettysburg, Pa.

The Generals end their season at 16-4,
tying a program record set in 2000 (16-2)
for wins in a season. The Bullets, 14-3,
move onto the NCAA quarterﬁnals, where
they will play Denison on Wednesday.

“I ’m going to miss this
team, but it was a good

ride. ”

Seth Flshman, senior attackman
 

Just four minutes into the game, W&L
was tied with Gettysburg 2-2, but then
the Bullets went on a 5-0 run, including
three goals from junior attackman Josh
Reichert. At intermission, the Generals
were down 9-4.

W&L came out of the break strong,
scoring ﬁve of the third quarter’s ﬁrst six
goals to cut the Bullets’ lead to one. But
Gettysburg scored with just four seconds
left in the third period to go up by two.
The Bullets dominated the ﬁnal frame,
outscoring the Generals 4-1 to preserve
the 15-10 victory.

Senior attackman Seth Fishman
scored three times in his ﬁnal collegiate
game while classmate Tim Skeen tallied
two goals and two assists. In his ﬁrst
game back from injury, senior midﬁelder
Harry St. John notched two goals while
sophomore attackman Spence Daw
scored once and assisted two other goals.
Junior attackman Will Keigier added
a goal and an assist, and sophomore
midﬁelder Drew Koeneman rounded out
the Generals’ scoring team with a goal.
Senior goalkeeper Connor Locke stopped
nine shots in goal for W&L.

Reichert led the Bullets with a career
day, scoring ﬁve times and helping on
three others. Junior midﬁelder Kyle
McGrath also reached the back of the
net three times. Senior goalkeeper Zach
Furshman made six saves on the day.

Fishman gave credit to his team’s
opponent. “Gettysburg was a very good
team. Their offense played smart and had
long sustained possessions and got out on
us early in the game. I thought we made
a great comeback in the third quarter and
our defense really buckled down, but we
could not keep the momentum going into
the fourth.

“We were banged up and just could not
get it done [Saturday]. I really believe we
left it all on the ﬁeld.”

To advance to the second round, W&L
ﬁrst beat, Farleigh Davidson-Florham
(FDU) 6-5 in overtime on Wednesday at

- a rainy Wilson Field.

The Dukes boast a very impressive
defense, not having surrendered double-
digit goals since March 5. Coming into
the contest, they were 13-4 on the year.
Before Wednesday, FDU’s only loss
in the last two months was in double
overtime to Manhattanville on April 22.
The Dukes Won their ﬁrst Middle Athletic
Conference title since 1981 by beating
Widener.

The Generals entered Wednesday’s
game just four days off their 15-14
overtime win over nationally ﬁrst-ranked
Roanoke in the ODAC championship. It
was the team‘s ﬁrst conference title since
2004 and ninth overall.

On Wednesday, the FDU defense was
in full force as the Generals tied their
lowest scoring output of the season at six
goals. Despite the lack of offense, W&L
did lead most of the way until the Dukes
tied the game at four at the start of the
fourth quarter.

The away team then took the lead with
just ﬁve minutes to go but then granted
the Generals a two-man advantage on a
double penalty call just twenty seconds
later. W&L did not waste the opportunity
as Skeen scored with 4:22 to go in
regulation. Neither team scored in the
last few minutes of the fourth quarter
with the score knotted at ﬁve.

In the extra frame, F DU had the ball
with just forty seconds to go but turned
it over to the Generals when head coach
Gene McCabe called a timeout. Coming
out of the huddle, Skeen passed the ball
behind the goal to Keigier, who wrapped
around the FDU goalkeeper’s right side.
Keigier scored on the shot with just
nine seconds to play in the sudden death
overtime period.

The Generals distributed the offensive
workload as Keigier, Skeen, Daw,
Koeneman, junior midﬁelder Chris
Washington and junior attackman Max
Mancuso each scored a goal. Keigler
recorded two assists while Daw, Skeen
and Washington each pitched in one a
piece.

St. John, a 2008 honorable mention
All-American, did not play Wednesday
because of an illness and a knee injury.

In addition to tying a school record for
wins in a season, W&L ends 2009 with
the most goals in the program’s history
(271).

Summing up the season and his career,
Fishman said, “Sure, we would have
liked to have gone a little bit further, but
I could not be more pleased with what
we accomplished. I’m going to miss this
team, but it was a great ride.”
