BY THE STUDENTS AND FOR THE STUDENiTS SINCE 1897

VOLUME CXII, NUMBER 3

By Adrianna Alley
STAFF WRITER

This fall, the color that’s
sweeping the W&L campus is
green, green, and more green.
With the rise in environmental
awareness in recent years, the
administration is setting the tone
with initiatives intended to help
protect the environment.
President Ruscio opened the
year with the 2008-2009 Insti-
tutional Priorities. In this list of
priorities lies W&L’s mission to
be environmentally conscious.
“This initiative is creating
an overall structure to support

the individual initiatives that
are taking place,” said President
Ruscio. One, Ruscio said, is to
build, “awareness of how we can
do better with our use of energy,
with minimizing our carbon
footprint, and treading gently on
our local environment, such as
Woods Creek.”

Since the start of the environ-
mental studies program in the
mid 1990s, W&L has committed
to informing students about en-
vironmental issues.

“This year is different because
we are ready to move to the next
phase. This is a long term com-

mitment,” Ruscio said.
While there have been efforts
on campus to reduce waste with

recycling, the administration
recognized that was only the be-
ginning.

“Klean Kanteens” are one
way W&L is raising awareness
of the importance of sustainabil-
ity. With concern about plastic
causing cancer and polluting,
Klean Kanteens are an environ-
mentally friendly alternative to
Nalgenes or disposable water
bottles.

Some services on campus
have evolved to ﬁt this initia-
tive. In the dining hall, there

are no longer food trays, which

by making certain the products

said sophomore Ine Tovo.

' Monitors on safe-ride system

While students learn new Traveller routes, monitors are there to help

By Anne Vesoulis
STAFF WRITER

Traveller Monitors are help-
ing to clear up confusion on new
Traveller routes by guiding stu-
dents safely and systematically
onto buses.

Getting shoved and disorient-
ed on a Friday night while trying
to get home from a party can be

I a problem for many students, es-
pecially with the introduction of
the new routes and stops, so the
new system should make a dif-
ference.

“Traveller monitors assist stu-
dents, especially ﬁrst-years, with
learning the different bus routes
on Wednesday, Friday, and Sat-
urday nights,” said Traveller co-
ordinator Rebecca Koval.

“Since we have a new Travel-
ler system this year, we decided
in late August that it would prob-
ably be helpful to have Traveller
employees standing at the main

stops, directing students and an-
swering questions,” she said.

Traveller monitors gener-
ally work in groups of two at the
main stops along the blue and
red Traveller routes and various
other busy locations where stu-
dents will be during the night.
The monitors work on two shifts
from 10 p.m. to 12 a.m. and 12
a.m. to 2 a.m.. The job of the
Traveller monitor, in addition to
directing students to their desti-
nation, is to make sure students
board the Traveller vehicles in a
safe, organized manner.

“The purpose of the Monitor
system is three-fold,” said se-
nior David Vaught, a Traveller
Monitor. “Firstly, it is to promote
safety boarding and exiting the
Traveller vehicles. Secondly, we
are here to promote good behav-
ior while on Traveller. Lastly,
the‘ Monitors help students deter-
mine which bus and route to take

to get to any given place.”

Three to four Monitors work
on weekend nights and start off
at Red Square and the Baker-Da-
vis-Gillam quad to help students
get on the correct bus when head-

blue route and Windfall and oc-
casionally the cabins for the red
route. Monitors get on the buses
to ﬁnd out where to go once the
parties end. Sometimes Monitors
ride the buses with students to be

these locations until the majority
of the crowd has left.

Eventually, the monitors

director, Ed Bulger.

“The monitor system also
provides a coherent institution
and authoritative presence to
maintain order,” Vaught said.
“Sometimes, students can be
very disrespectful to the Travel-

ler drivers. What students need
to understand is while Travel-
ler is there for them, it is also a
privilege.

“I, as well as many of the oth-
er Traveller drivers don’t appre-
ciate getting cussed out by bel-
ligerent students trying to get to
a party or back to their places of
residence. 1 think that the moni-
tor system is helping to alleviate
this issue. It ‘is more effective
than simply an ad campaign,” he
said.

Vaught said keeping order
can be difﬁcult depending on the
assertiveness and crowd control
skills of the monitors. To ad-
dress this issue at a Windfall par-
ty, some monitors put students in
line and gave them numbers to
know how many people could ﬁt
on the next bus.

“This line helped to keep peo-
ple in order and prevented them
from running around attempting

to catch the bus in the middle of
the road,” said Vaught.

At present, the Monitor sys-
tem is being evaluated in order to
determine to what extent, if any,
the system will continue. Koval
said monitors would work on
Friday and Saturday nights until
September 27 and busy week-
ends such as Homecoming and
Alumni weekend.

“I think that it’s a good idea to
have people assisting students to
get on the correct bus,” said ﬁrst-
year Anna van Erven. “Many of
us are in a new environment and
ﬁnd it hard to get around under
normal circumstances.”

Many believe that the Travel-
ler monitor system has been an
effective and much-needed addi-
tion to the Traveller program.

“I’d give it 8 out of 10,”
Vaught said. “It’s been very ef-
fective in informing students of
the new routes.” I

Johnson Lecture Series begins

Brookhiser oﬂers lessons on leadership and insight into Washington 3 life

Renowned journalist, biog-
rapher and historian Richard
Brookhiser spoke to a large audi-
ence of students, faculty and lo-
cals in Lee Chapel on Thursday.

Brookhiser is the first guest
of the Johnson Lecture Series
in Leadership and Integrity.
Brookhiser’s topic: one of Amer-
ica’s greatest leaders, George
Washington.

Brookhiser stood at the lec-
tern in a patriotic red and white
striped shirt. His speech on

leader in the American Revolu-
tion and the founding of W&L
engrossed audiences for over an

the author of many books on the
/founding fathers and the creator
of a PBS documentary on Wash-
ington. Judging from his well-
attended lecture, which was open
to the public, many students and
locals wanted to get to know
George Washington a little bit
better.

Brookhiser discussed the
ways in which Washington was
a leader in all areas of his life,
including his positions as a poli-
tician, military officer and busi-
nessman, and argued that the

' same values and traits of leader-

ship still apply today. He focused
on the importance of facing and

when dealing with others, along

live and what we do. You never
have a clean slate.”

Professor Rob Strong, head
of the Johnson Program, said
the decision to invite Brookhiser
was easy. Brookhiser’s talk on
Washington and leadership ﬁt
with the goals of the Johnson
Program.

“It made sense in a lot of
ways,” Strong said. “Washington
is a distant character everyone
knows is great, but they have a
hard time connecting with him.
We often look at him at a dis-
tance, from an angle.”

Brookhiser is the ﬁrst of
many speakers sponsored by the
Series. The Johnson Lecture
Series, made possible by a $100
million donation, is one of the
largest speaking endowments on
campus at $15 million.

The next guest speaker will

be Liza Mundy, a Washington
Post journalist and noted author,
who will speak in Lee Chapel on
October 7th.

“The possibilities for the pro- -

gram are endless,” said Strong.
“I hope to hear from a lot of stu-
dents with ideas.”

Students who attended the
presentation left with a greater
appreciation of Washington and
our school.

“It gives me a lot of pride
to know that W&L is founded
on principles of great men like
Washington,” said ﬁrst year Luke
Andersen.

When asked what he would
say to George Washington if they
ever met, Richard Brookhiser’s
response was “Thank you.”

As well, dining services has forged
relationships with local farmers and
producers to bring fresh, local food into
the dining hall. Through providing 10-
cally grown food, local water supplies,
soil fertility and biodiversity are beneﬁt-
ted. Likewise, W&L has its own campus
garden to further these efforts.

Ruscio hopes the initiative will set

' the trend for future sustainability ef-

forts. .“It is going to be important for
students to accept the challenge. The
University is trying to set an example,
and minor changes can make a real dif-

“Sustainability is also being con-
scious about your decisions,” Cushman
said. “Power down, and think about the

Starting September 28, W&L will
hold a Campus Sustainability Week to
raise the awareness of the effort to be-
come a green campus. Events include a
kick-off concert featuring the Adrienne

tainability.

Cushman said the administration
would continue looking for ways to im-
prove sustainability efforts on campus,
such as the widespread use of recycla-
ble stock, including paper and other of-
ﬁce supplies. “Of course there are still
things we are exploring,” she said.

Don’t I
know you?

Joining that Greek house didn’t
give you license to forget friends

By Gozi Egbuonu
COLU M NIST

I know you’re wondering if you have picked up the wrong
paper, but not to worry, you are reading the Ring—Tum Phi and
yes, Gozi is writing a piece for the Phi.

Oh, don’t be so shocked. I do know how to write something
besides random celebrity gossip.

I’ve decided to write this piece because something has really
been bothering me on this campus for quite some time, and I
would really like to address it.

My idea for this piece came about when I engaged in the most
awkward encounter I have ever had at Washington and Lee.

Yes, more awkward than when I was rapping Geto Boys as I
passed president Ruscio on the Colonnade.

The moment consisted of someone I had known freshman
year awkwardly avoiding eye contact with me so as to save him
the trouble of having to acknowledge my presence.

Messed up?

Yes.

I was immediately tempted to yell “Hi!” in the most awk-
ward way possible but restrained myself and decided that instead
I needed to write a piece addressing this incredibly unfortunate
epidemic taking over this campus.

The epidemic you ask?

The disintegration of friendships as a result of people joining
various Greek organizations.

Now, don’t get me wrong. There are certainly many people
who have been able to carry on relationships and friendships

I am not asking for a liver a pint of your
blood, your left toe, or your ﬁrst-born child,
but a simple “hello” to acknowledge that you
and I once knew each other shared a laugh
together, or maybe even cried over something

together once upon a time would be nice.

 

with people in a different Greek organization than theirs.

I have no problem with those relationships, and I am truly
happy that they exist. What frustrates me isn’t a simple matter of
‘I don’t get to pow-wow with Tom, Dick, and Harry because they
are out at the Poles and I live in Red Square.’

No, that is deﬁnitely not the issue that has been bugging me.

My frustration surrounds this misguided idea of a social hier-
archy that leads otherwise decent people to choose another ‘rung’
up on the so-called ‘social ladder’ over common decency.

I am not asking for a liver, a pint of your blood, your left
toe, or your ﬁrst-bom child, but a simple “hello” to acknowledge
that you and I once knew each other, shared a laugh together,
or maybe even cried over something together once upon a time
would be nice. 4 I

It saddens me to see people I once respected buy into (and
endorse) this idea that in order for my Greek organization to look
‘cool’ I have to immediately squash all relationships with people
who do not ﬁt into my social equation.

The fact that you hold yourself to this idea of a social hi-
erarchy that governs your every move is, to be honest, pretty
pathetic.

What does it say about your character if you’re legitimately
worried that you will lose the respect of your frat or srat if you

‘ don’t sell out the people who were probably your ﬁrst friends on
campus?

The phrase ‘social climber’ immediately comes to mind.

‘Vain,’ ‘delusional,’ and ‘lame’ are also ﬂoating around there,
too.

\ Ultimately, my only advice to you chronic offenders is to get
back to reality.
I Once you leave W&L, not many people are going to care
about how ‘cool’ your fraternity or sorority was on campus.

‘The Man’ won’t care (unless he was in your frat, and then
you schmooze until the cows come home).

Keep those old friends and say “hi!” when you see him or her
on campus. '

Please don’t try the awkward avoid-eye-contact game.

Also, the pretend-I—got-a-call—on-vibrate game doesn’t work
as well. We are all quite aware that your phone didn’t just go
off.

And the I-am-so-deep-in-thought-that-I-stare-off-into-the-
abyss game is also not kosher. We all know there is nothing else
going on in your mind that is preventing you from looking slight-
ly to the left or right to notice an old friend. That ‘cool’ frat or srat
of yours won’t drop you like a bad habit for opening your mouth
and saying “Hey.”

Being rude and avoiding those people who were once there
for you is really not the General way and frankly, I don’t think
either of our institution’s namesakes would be very happy with
such behavior.

‘Obamanomics’ load? I

Abel Delgado szzes all boats sinking under Dem. plan

By Abel Delgado
c o L u M N I sr

Barack Obama wants us to
move past the failed economic
policies of the past.

8 years and back to the failed
economic policies of the 1960s
and 70s.

Let’s start with Obama’s
promise to lower taxes on 95% of
American families.

Obama himself has said his
other plans would cost around $1
trillion over four years.

Lowering taxes and dramati-
cally increasing spending is ex-
actly what Bush did. There is no
possible way for him to do both
without ballooning the deﬁcit,
something he has criticized Bush
for doing.

Obama said he would pay for
his massive government increase
by closing corporate tax loop-
holes.

He offers no evidence clos-
ing those loopholes will generate
anything close to a trillion in rev-
enue and he ignores the fact that
the US already has the second
highest corporate tax rate in the
world. He somehow thinks that
raising business taxes will stop
outsourcing and create jobs.

Then there are theIinfamous
'top one percent’ income earners
that Obama has no qualms about
raising taxes on.

About 75 percent of them are

small-business owners - not mil-
lionaire CEOs.

Small businesses are the back-
bone of our economy, creating
jobs while employment has fallen
in every other sector. Raising tax-
es on their owners will certainly
put an end to that.

warned Americans that “a gov-
ernment big enough to give you
everything you want, is strong
enough to take everything you
have.”

Obamanomics may hold
weight in western Europe, but it
rings hollow in western Pennsyl-

Americans who take a close look at Obam-

. anomics will have little hope that if he wins

their pockets will be left with more than spare

change.

 

Obama’s claim that his tax
increases won’t hurt most Ameri-
cans assumes that most Ameri-
cans don’t buy from businesses
or work for them. An increase
in business taxes will certainly
lead to an increase in prices, a
decrease in wages, an increase in
layoffs, or all three.

Obama’s plan is eerily famil-
iar to Johnson’s ‘Great Society’
which most history books will
tell you didn’t turn out so great.

Obamanomics is all about
wealth redistribution, an inher-
ently socialist ideal that may not
be completely undemocratic but
it is utterly at odds with Ameri-
can ideals.

It was Thomas Jefferson who

vania.

Obama argues that McCain
would offer no tax relief for the
middle class. This assumes no
one in‘ the middle class has kids
since McCain plans to double
the child tax credit and no one in
the middle class pays for health
insurance since McCain would
give a $5,000 tax credit per fam-
ily for health insurance.

It’s little wonder that as ﬁnan-
cial markets came down crum-
bling this week it was Obama
who had no speciﬁc plan to offer
while McCain did.

I am not saying McCain’s
plans will avoid recession, but
considering Obama’s deﬁcit
spending and anti-business poli-

cies, at least McCain’s won’t
cause a depression.

With all this fear of the next
depression being near, it is impor-
tant to remember that protection-
ist economic policies were some
of the causes of the last one.

Obama is as protectionist as
you can get, speaking out against
free trade agreements with our
three biggest allies in the hemi-
sphere, Canada, Mexico, and Co-
lombia.

Obamanomics relies on the
John Edwards philosophy of two
Americas.

As someone who grew up
in what Edwards would call the
‘Second America,’ I can attest
that there is only one America
and it is hurting from Main Street
to Wall Street.

Working class Americans are
smart enough to realize an in-
crease in government spending
doesn’t always add up to a better
future.

They realize government
should play an important and
positive role in getting us out of
the mess we are in but an anti-
business government is no way
to promote a recovery.

Americans who take a close
look at Obamanomics will have
little hope that if he wins their
pockets will be leﬁ with more
than spare change.

‘fresh’ controversy

Grace Andrews wonders what to make of the ﬁrst years ’moniker

By Grace Andrews
c o L u M N I sr

A friend of mine, Billy Shake-
speare, once said, “What’s in a
name? That which we call a rose
by any other name would smell
as sweet.”

Would it really?

This year is the ﬁrst year of
‘ﬁrst-years,’ and that’s not a rid-
dle.

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has let the title ‘freshmen’
go in order to embrace the term
‘ﬁrst-year. ’

When I was asked to write
an opinion piece concerning this
matter, I was a bit hesitant be-
cause I myself had yet to form
a strong opinion about the name
change. Thus began my search
for an answer.

I sought out opinions of stu-
dents and faculty in order to for-
mulate one for myself.

Reactions to the name change
range from outraged: “It’s ab-
solutely ridiculous! We can’t
change everything because some-
one might get offended at some-
thing, that’s part of life! People
get offended! Where will we
draw the line? It’s preposterous
and I’m going out of my way
to see to it that I’m still called a
‘freshman,”’ exclaimed ﬁrst-year
Robbie Uhlman; to educational,
“‘First-year’ reﬂects best prac-
tices in the ﬁeld of student affairs
and is the terminology used by
both of the primary national orga-
nizations that support students on
college campuses. The national
center is entitled the ‘F irst-Year
Experience.’ The terms ‘fresh-
men’ and ‘dorm’ will probably
always exist, but those of us that
work in the profession of student
affairs much prefer the terms
‘ﬁrst-year’ and ‘residence halls,”’
said Associate Dean of Student
Affairs and Dean of First-Year
Students Dean Leonard.

Obviously, both quotes show
there is diversity of thought con-
cerning the change.

However, the rumor-mill
states that the change has more to

do with sexist language than just
administrative changes in termi-
nology.

Professor David Novack stat-
ed, “I believe that the change is
appropriate as part of a broader
attempt to make certain that
women at W&L are considered
as central as men to our collec-
tive life. I see this move as part
of a general change from the use
of the generic masculine to the
use of a true gender neutral lan-
guage.”

Senior Director of Admis-
sions, Erin Hutchinson expressed
her opinion in a delightful yet
informative way, “I suppose I’m

Emily Leary makes a valid argu-
ment with these words: “It seems
kind of odd to me that the univer-
sity would insist on changing the
title to ‘ﬁrst-years’ as opposed
to ‘freshman.’ If the problem is
the ‘man’ in the term ‘freshman,’
then wouldn’t we also have to
stop using words such as fe‘male’
and wo ‘man’. It seems to me to
be a slight over-reaction.”

I asked many individuals how
they felt about the change, but
few actually knew or understood
why the university had made the
change.

Others had no idea what I was
talking about.

“To me, freshman ’and ﬁrst-year ’mean the

same thing, except the latter doesn ’t roll off the

tongue as easily. ”

Erln Hutchinson, Senlor Dlrector of Admlsslons

not as sensitive to nomenclature
as others are. To me, ‘freshman’
and ‘ﬁrst-year’ mean the same
thing, except the latter doesn’t roll
off the tongue as easily. I didn’t
feel excluded or unacknowledged
as a woman years ago when I was
a called a freshman. And as a
(gracefully, I hope) aging wom-
an, what I wouldn’t give to have
someone consider me ‘fresh.’
The name change doesn’t stir any
passionate feelings from me one
way or another, but in the deep-
est recesses of my heart, I guess I
feel that it is unnecessary. Adam
and I always tell our children, ‘It
isn’t what they call you (that mat-
ters), it’s what you answer to.”’

Yet, for me Hutchinson’s
words raise a very interesting
point.

If it’s what you answer to that
matters, should women have to
answer to a title that has ‘man’
in it?

If not, what would women re-
spond to?

Freshman (or First-Year?)

For me, this lack of knowl-
edge is one of the biggest prob-
lems with the name change.

For any sort of change to be
effective, the people who are af-
fected should know why things
have been changed.

Senior Jamila Seaton stated,
“As a feminist, I think we hinder
our progress if we pick at min-

.ute issues without looking at the

broader spectrum. Instead of try-
ing to ﬁnd new words to deﬁne
ourselves, maybe we should work
on changing the mentality and as-
sumptions behind the words. With
the rise of women in higher edu-
cation, when someone refers to a

First Year (or Freshman?)
Levi Throckmorton reiterates
a bit of Seaton’s perception, “I
feel as though they’re trying to
change it because contained in
the word ‘freshman’ is the word
‘man.’ And it seems as though
nowadays, any generic term that
contains the word ‘man’ is being
criticized as being excluding of
women, no matter how ridiculous
that accusation may be. I person-
ally think it’s silly if we’re trying
not to offend anyone when the
term wasn’t offensive in the ﬁrst
place.”

Throckmorton presents me

with a bit of a dilemma because
he may be correct about the ge-
neric all-inclusive being the term
‘man,’ but one may have to keep
in mind that linguistically and
historically speaking, most terms
are.

Will we be changing the Eng-
lish language entirely to make it
more neutral when we seem to
see gendered words as neutral

’ already?

‘freshman,’ it is very likely that I

they are referring to a female, so
the word has lost its gender ties,
which I believe is some show of
progress in itself.”

I have to agree with some of
what Seaton says. If it’s the lan-
guage we wish to change, that
itself maybe more difﬁcult than
changing the mentality behind
the words.

‘ Nonetheless, just because
someone may use the title ‘ﬁrst-
year’ doesn’t mean that they have
disregarded the idea that certain
stations in life are only for men.

I know that language can be a
powerful tool and that by using a
word that has ‘man’ in it, you are
ultimately excluding a subset of
the population, but my real issue
is that every word which we use
for women has a male gendered
noun as a portion of the title.

If awareness is what we seek,
then we should have open discus-
sions about gendered words and
truly attempt to understand the
effects of such words.

It is for that reason that I
continue to be neutral about the
change.

Sometimes, I will use ﬁrst-
years and other times, I will say
‘freshman,’ but I will always say
it in reference to all people, male
or female.

And that’s what’s important.

Crighton Allen can ’t help but think we ’re getting screwed

By Crighton Allen
C 0 L U M N I S T

Life in Lex is about as close
to perfect as we could reason-
ably expect it to be. That is, un-
til we all have to face the bane
of every student in every college
in the nation.

These times occur at the
beginning and end of each aca-
demic term. They are your fa-
vorite times and mine, textbook
buying and sellback.

Get excited.

This term, I spent close to
$600 at the bookstore. That is
absurd.

I could get a VIP ticket to
the Rolling Stones and still have
enough left over to pay for my
share of the after-party aboard
Mick Jagger’s tour bus for that
much.

And my case is by far the
rule, and not the exception.

It’s the premed students I feel
the worst for. The textbook for
organic chemistry alone costs
$170 this year. That stings, es-
pecially if your tuition-payer
happens to now be working
within a l0—mile radius of Wall
Street.

Well, you ask, if your books
cost you $500, surely you must
get about half of that back at
sellback time, right?

Yeah, and I just beat LeBron
James in a game of one—on-one.

If you’re lucky, you’ll get
back $100 of the $500 you origi-
nally shelled out. Between new
editions of text books coming
out, courses being dropped and

added, and professors amending
their syllabi, hundreds of dol-
lars worth of books you bought
just 12 weeks earlier are now
(monetarily, at least) worthless
to you.

The sole light in the darkness
that is text book buyback is the
large crate for Books for Africa
that is always overflowing with
now obsolete textbooks that
people have donated rather than
simply hurled into a trashcan
in a ﬁt of rage. Instead, those

sible to get out of there in less
than 30 minutes. Who at W&L
really has time to go to Wal-Mart
just for a pack of graph paper?

No one. Hence the $12 per
pack at the bookstore. They
charge that much because they
can get away with it.

Also, what was with the
course packs all being switched
over to the bookstore? At the
start of the term, I went to see
who usually handles the course
packs, the lovely ladies of New-

This term, I spent close to $600 at the book-
store. That is absurd. I could get a VIP
ticket to the Rolling Stones...for that much.

And my case is by far the rule...

books can go on for a higher
purpose.

Those in charge of that pro-
gram, keep up the good work.
People with books W&L won’t
take back, keep giving the gift
of education.

But I digress.

In a related note, just tonight
in fact, I heard someone remark
that they paid $12 for a spiral
notebook of graph paper at the
bookstore. That would cost
three, maybe four bucks at Wal-
Mart.

But going to Wal-Mart is
such an ordeal; no matter what
you run in for, it seems impos-

comb Hall, and they pointed me
back over to the Commons.

That was the ﬁrst I had heard
of it.

Where was the advanced
warning or perhaps an attempt
to solicit student feedback be-
fore making a change? If there
was, I never heard about it and
I keep an ear low to the ground
for tidbits like that.

I’ve heard from reliable
sources, but, to be fair, have not
conﬁrmed for myself, that this
change of location meant a jack-
ing up of prices.

If that is so, we’ve got a
problem. Because if it is indeed

true, that would mean by virtue
of saving us an extra stroll down
the Colonnade, prices can be
raised.

Just to rehash: it’s the same
packet, just on a different shelf.
And that makes it okay to raise
the price?

Not in my book, no way.
Trust me, you’re not doing us
that big a favor. I’ll suffer the
walk down an historic landmark
and take in the breathtaking
view of the mountains behind
Lee Chapel, it’s ok, really.

Bottom line, buying text-
books stinks.

I know it, you know it, col-
lege students and their families
nationwide know it. _

Administrators: please help
us out here; ﬁnd a way to re-
duce the book prices for your
students.

Washington & Lee provides
its students one of the best edu-
cational opportunities in the na-
tion, hands down.

However, on the way to us re-
ceiving that education, it would
be nice to not have to play the
victim of price-gouging of Ad-
vanced Principle of Managerial
Accounting, 7"’ Edition.

1 am in Economics 101 this
semester so maybe "we haven’t
gotten to this lesson yet, but I
am pretty sure that there is no
economic law that can make
$500 shrink to less than $100 in
three months’ time.

P1 BETA PHI &
Phi Beta Sigma  

Presents:

Dear Editor,

Your Sept. 15, 2008 front-
page article, “W&L sporting
events to be broadcast,” omits
two key pieces of informa-
tion regarding Washington and
Lee sports broadcasts. First,
the headline itself implies
that Generals games have not
been aired prior to the school’s
contract with B2. This simply
isn’t true. Since 1972, WLUR
has broadcasted Washing-
ton and Lee athletic contests,
from football, basketball and
lacrosse to more recent addi-
tions like soccer, volleyball
and ﬁeld hockey. These broad-

_ casts have also been available

online for nearly a decade. Nu-
merous students and alumni
have devoted countless hours
to provide commentary for
these events, and their dedica-
tion has meant a great deal to
W&L athletes, parents, alumni
and fans.

Secondly, I’m curious as
to why WLUR’s role in the
B2 Networks videocasts was
not mentioned in yourarticle.
The live audio that accompa-

nies every W&L game on B2
will be provided by WLUR
announcers. They’re even pro-
viding commentary for games
that do not air on the radio sta-
tion——including the Sept. 13
women’s soccer match against
Roanoke, which ran on B2
while W&L’s football contest
in Sewanee, Tenn., was broad-
casted live on WLUR.

The B2 Networks service
is a wonderﬁil opportunity
for Washington and Lee fans
to follow their teams online.
However, ~ WLUR’s long-
standing commitment to cov-
erage of the Generals—and
its direct contributions to the
B2 videocasts—should be ac-
knowledged.

Sincerely,

a 

donates blood

W&L and Red Cross
join forces to hold blood
drive, promote service

By Eleanor Kennedy
surr wanna

The Washington and Lee community re-
sponded to the Red Cross’s call for help by do-
nating blood on Tuesday.

The American Red Cross’s list of 50 facts
about blood donation makes the stunning state-
ment that “every two seconds someone in the
U.S. needs blood.”

Luckily, organizations and volunteers work-
ing to satisfy this need. And on Tuesday, Sep-
tember l6, the Washington and Lee student
body helped out, too.

“Donating blood is an easy way to do ser-
vice,” said Jenna Walls, the general chair of Na-
bors Service Leauge.

The Nabors Service League worked in con-
junction with the American Red Cross to coor-

“People are quick to list
excuses for not donating
blood... [but] many are ones
., that can be overcome when you
think about what your blood
donation would mean to a per-
son in need. ”

SAMARA FRANCISCO, Speclal Projects &
Events Co-Chalr for Nabors Servlce
 

dinate a blood drive this past week and W&L
students responded in force. .

The students involved wanted to send the
message that giving blood is an extremely pow-
erful form of service. According to the Ameri-
can Red Cross Website, “one blood donation
can save the lives of up to three people.”

Walls reported that approximately 65 stu-
dents signed up to donate blood. About 20 peo-
ple were deemed ineligible to donate blood due
to quick tests run by the workers, so a total of
about 45 people gave blood. Based on the esti-
mates from the Red Cross, that means that the
W&L student body was able to save 135 lives.

Samara Francisco, Special Projects and
Events Co-Chair for the Nabors Service League,
described more reasons to give blood. She ex-
plained blood donation is even more important
during natural disasters, such as the hurricanes
recently experienced in Gulf coast regions.

Even without natural disasters, both regional
and national supplies are still continually low,
needing to be replenished every day, Francisco
said.

It is this need for replenishing the blood sup-
ply that led Austin Rehﬁeld of the American
Red Cross to contact the Nabors Service League
about sponsoring a blood drive in an attempt to

i get large groups of students involved.

In the.past, the Nabors Service League has
held two blood drives a year. This year, accord-
ing to Walls, the club is doubling its effort. Four
blood drives will be held. The next one should
happen sometime in November. The other two
should occur in February and April.

Members of Nabors explained that students
who are interested in being involved with the
future blood drive have several options. First is,
of course, donating blood. Students who want to
donate should keep their eyes open for sign-ups
in the days leading up to future drives.

If students are interested in being involved
in the sign—up process or any other organizing
aspect, they should contact Francisco. She, ac-
cording to Walls, is responsible for almost all
aspects of coordinating the blood drive

Future drives may include incentives to at-
tract more donors, such as Sweet Things gift
cards, Francisco explained. Potential donors are
also reminded to eat iron rich foods and drink
plenty of liquids in the days leading up to the
day of the drive.

Walls and Francisco would like to see greater
participation in the drives in the future.

Francisco said that although “people are
quick to list excuses for not donating blood...
many are ones that people can overcome when
you think about what your blood donation
would mean to a person in need.”

Uniqueart “Stampedes”

STAFF WRITER

Former Buena Vista resident and
respected artist, J .J . Cromer, opened
his latest exhibit in the Staniar Gal-
lery, called “Our Stampedes Are Com-
patible,” on Sepember 1.

The works, on display until Octo-
ber 5, reﬂect a wide range of styles
the artist has tried. Yet, throughout the
collection, there is cohesiveness, es-
tablished through Cromer’s consistent
attention to detail, repetitious motifs,
and interesting use of bold color.

Cromer has created hundreds of
works, each of which he describes as a
“letter” in his own personal alphabet.
His art, he says, is constantly evolving.
Indeed, it is, and this evolution can be
observed best in one of his collections.
Although the collection in the Staniar
Gallery is by no means a large part of
all his created works, those selected to
be shown are representational of the
artist’s growth and experiment.

Cromer started with paintings but

.. ro .

(.4 . ltfv;({r": _

has gone on to master pen and ink,
colored pencil, and collage media. In
fact, in several of Cromer’s designs,
cutouts of various jungle animals
make an appearance. This is the result
of some careful scissor work applied
to old school textbooks.

Other pictures include slices from
some of Cromer’s old paintings. While
some artists would never dream of de-
ﬁling old artwork, Cromer has adopt-
ed a healthy philosophy in which he
believes that focusing too much on the
past or what you have already done
prevents moving forward and evolv-
ing. '

That’s not to say Cromer doesn’t
draw inﬂuences from older pieces.
Often, if he likes a certain shape or
speciﬁc design,.Cromer will incorpo-
rate it into another later picture. For
instance, the image of a phantom ghost
with its hands behind its back appears
in several pieces, both as a point of
focus, as well as a background pat-
tern. His images are fascinating and
curious——Cromer himself admits he

is unsure of where these ghosts origi-
nated from.

“His works are expressive and viv-
id. Often they are obsessively detailed.
Objects may be recognizable but al-
ways describe his special viewpoint.
They are sometimes witty, sometimes
satirical, or even sad, but rarely ‘nor-
mal,’” said Grey Carter, Cromer’s ten-
year agent, of the artist’s work on his
website.

“Normal” isn’t a word that can
describe Cromer in many ways at
all. Even the artist’s start into the
ﬁeld was an unusual one and is part
of the reason he has been branded as
an ‘outsider’ artist. Sometime during
the late 1990’s, Cromer and his wife,
a Washington and Lee University Law
graduate, decided they wanted to “live
with art.”

Unable to afford any, however,
Cromer picked up a children’s paint
palette one night while watching tele-
vision and began to paint. This event
sparked an obsession in Cromer, caus-
ing him to draw about ﬁve to six hours

BRETT HOLTON / Copy Editor
Cromer’s artistic tools include painting, pen and ink, colored pencil, collage and cutouts from previous works of art.

Buena Vista native J. J. Cromer showcases art in Lenfest

every night, a habit he has continued
to keep over the years.

Having earned a bachelor’s degree
in history and masters in both English
and library science, Cromer works as a
librarian in Virginia. At work, it’s his
job to be organized and locate answers
easily and precisely. His art, however,
is often a departure from his otherwise
very orderly lifestyle.

“When he works, he says, he has
no plan. Instead, he feels he is let-
ting free an expression that is not fully
within his control. He describes it as
a visionary experience, where all else
around him melts away and all that is
left is the rhythm and motion of cre-
ation,” said Roger Thompson, a pro-
fessor at VMI.

Pam Simpson, an art history profes-
sor at Washington and Lee University,
describes Cromer’s work as “so pow-
erful,” despite its “flatness.” His work,
she said, is far more than just lines. To
see Cromer’s fantastic work yourself,
visit the gallery Monday through Fri-
day from 8 to 5 p.m.

Fair to promote programs abroad

Study Abroad Fair will provide info, unveil new programs

By Laura Campbell
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee’s Study
Abroad Fair will be held on Tuesday,
September 23 from 1 to 3 pm. on the
Stemmons Plaza in front of Leybum
Library.

Any students considering studying
abroad in the coming school years, or
who just want to ﬁnd out more about
the programs offered, are encouraged
to attend.

For ten years, the annual fair has
provided a glimpse of the numerous
study-abroad opportunities at W&L.

“Interest in and enthusiasm for
study abroad is high among students,”
said Latha Dawson, coordinator of the
Spring Term Abroad programs. “This
event is usually well attended.”

Hosted by the Center for Interna-
tional Education, the fair makes study-
abroad opportunities accessible to
students. The Center for International
Education will have a table at the fair,
and answer any questions-about study
abroad, whether they concern proce-
dure, course credits, or financial aid.

The fair is an especially good op-
portunity for ﬁrst- and second-year

undergraduates looking to learn more

. about their options.

W&L’s own international programs
will be represented at the fair, includ-
ing the Spring Terrn Abroad programs
for 2009. A variety of disciplines are

offered, ranging from Spanish lan-’

guage in Spain to drawing in Italy to
political economy in Ghana.

One of the W&L-sponsored‘ pro-
grams to be represented at the fair is
a three-week expedition to Greece and
Turkey, led by Professors Scott John-
son and Kevin Crotty. Students will
study the ancient, late antique, and
Byzantine cultures of those nations.

“This is a new addition of a pro-
gram that we did in the past, about
four years ago,” says Professor Crotty,
head of the Classics department. “We
have done this before, but this is an
edited and updated version.”

To learn more about this program,
students should make sure to stick
around for the latter half of the fair,
when Professor Johnson will be avail-
able to answer questions.

Theater Professor Joseph Martinez
has been leading an annual expedi-
tion to London for 25 years. Having
attended graduate school in London,

Professor Martinez is well acquainted
with the artistic scene in England, and
will provide students with a unique
chance to learn from professional art-
ists and performers. This ﬁve-week
program is available to all students
without prerequisite. Professor Marti-
nez will be available at the fair to give
further information relating to cost,
coursework, and speciﬁcs of the trip.
“I think the study abroad fair is a
good thing, not only in terms of infor-
mation, but students get to meet the

-director,” said Martinez. “If you’re

going to go abroad with someone, it’s
important that you get along with that
person. F ace-to-face, personal contact
is as important as the information it-
self.”

This year, students are offered a
special chance to deepen their un-
derstanding of honor—a uniquely
valuable asset to a W&L education.
Professors Lad Sessions and Harvey
Markowitz will lead a comparative
study of American Indian and Maori
cultures and their perceptions of honor.
Open to all students, this is a chance to
earn credits in 300-level Philosophy
and Anthropology while experiencing
the beauty of New Zealand.

“This is the first time, last time, and
only time we’re doing this,” says Pro-
fessor Sessions. ‘‘It is a one-of-a-kind
opportunity.” For more information,
he and Professor Markowitz will be
available at the Fair.

Representatives from over twenty
non-W&L organizations have also
been invited to give information and

answer questions. The Council on

International Educational Exchange
(CIEE), the Institute for Study Abroad
(IF SA), the Danish Institute for Study
Abroad (DIS), and Syracuse Univer-
sity in Florence, as well as many oth-
ers, will be represented. Many of these
organizations offer multiple programs;
the CIEE administers over 100 study-
abroad programs in over 35 countries.

Programs sponsored by other col-
leges and universities will be repre-
sented. The University of Virginia pro-
gram for Hispanic Studies in Valencia,
Spain and VMI’s Arabic Studies in
Morocco are open to W&L students,
as is Sweetbriar College’s coeduca-
tional junior year programs in France
or Spain.

In case of weather, the fair will take
place in the Great Hall of the science
center.

Supporting the arts

Fine arts faculty begins Grassroots Arts Movement

By Flndley Merrltt
STAFF WRITER

The ﬁne arts faculty of
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty are bringing together artisti-
cally geared students to partake
in what will be known as The
Grassroots Arts Movement.

On Wednesday, October 1,
students who have committed
to an intensive study in either
Art History, Art Studio, Music
or Theater and Dance will as-
semble in Wilson 2018 for a
conversation with the common
goal of creating camaraderie
among the ﬁne arts at W&L.

Though the project is being

. initiated by faculty members,

their hope is that students will
lead the discussions and poten-
tially create student-led organi-
zation.

One of the Movement’s
proponents, Professor George
Bent, said, “We want to help
get things started, but we also
recognize that it can only hap-
pen if students want it to.”

The ﬁrst meeting will pres-
ent a summary of what the ﬁne
arts department professors dis-
cussed, but it will mainly re-
volve around students’ input.

Bent said faculty will be
there for the “meet and greet”
part of Wednesday’s meeting,
but they will leave thereafter to
let students continue the con-
versation.

The Movement’s propo-

nents hope it will be a chance
for students interested in the
arts to talk about their needs
as individual artists as well as
their role in the broader com-
munity.

Another faculty supporter,
Art Professor Pamela Simpson
stated that “We want students
to brainstorm in addition to our
proposals. If an organization
comes out of that, then great!”

Simpsonestimatesthatabout

Washington and Lee’s artisti-
cally gifted students.

“We thought that if there
was a student arts organization,
that might be one thing that
would help,” said Simpson.

“But we know that it would
have to be organized and led by
the students to be effective,”
she added.

Simpson also stated that
there was only so much the ﬁne
arts faculty could do to foster

“Last year we had a number of freshmen

question their decisions to be atW&L.,..
they didn ’tfeel that as students interested

in the arts they were ﬁtting in socially. ”

Pamela Simpson, Art Professor

25 to 30 students will come,
although with the signiﬁcant
number of students enrolled in
arts programs, she hopes there
will be many more.

Simpson added, “Last year
we had a number of freshmen
question their decision to be at
W&L not because they were
unhappy with classes, but be-
cause they didn’t feel that as
students interested in the arts
they were ﬁtting in socially.”

As a result faculty members ‘

gathered this summer for some
“brainstorming” in order to find
more ways to build support for

campus wide enthusiasm about

the arts.

“We can send emails letting
students know about upcoming
showcases, but that can only go
so far.”

The movement has ulti-
mately received an enthusiastic
response.

Jennefer Davies, head of the
dance department, expressed

her eagerness for the project to ’

catch on.

“The concept is amazing,”
said Davies.

“lt’s all about creating a
group of artists who can sup-

port one another on campus.”

Professor Bent stated that
he hopes students who have
“Vested interest in living and
learning in an active and en-
gaged community of artists and
patrons will begin the process
of taking on some of the re-
sponsibility for nurturing such
an environment in Lenfest and
Wilson Hall.”

Faculty members have stat-
ed they are extremely interested
in seeing the movement grow
within the student body, as it
echoes a general trend toward
campus arts appreciation.

“The need for this kind of
group just shows how far the
W&L community has come,”
said Davies.

Despite there being over 50
students majoring in the ﬁne
arts, this is ﬁrst time anyone
has tried to initiate a broad arts
organization at Washington
and Lee.

“Other various departments
all make sure their majors have
support, so why shouldn’t the
Lenfest [programs]?” chal-
lenged Simpson.

On October 1 that could
well change as students from
across nearly a dozen ﬁne arts
programs have the opportunity
to form W&L’s ﬁrst Grassroots
Arts Movement.

Bone-Headed Plays

continued from page 8

committed the fourth biggest
bone-headed play in sports. In
a baseball game Larry Walker
caught an easy ﬂy ball, thought it
was the third out, tossed the ball
to a fan.

Two problems: There were
only two outs, and there was a
runner on base. He proceeded to
very eagerly ask the fan for the
ball back.

Another baseball player
topped Larry Walker though.
Sammy Sosa. During the 2003
season he was jammed on a pitch
and broke his bat.

Again one little problem, his
bat had cork in the middle of it.
Putting cork in a baseball bat is
illegal because it makes the bat
both lighter, easier to swing, and
gives it more pop. Essentially

corking a bat is a way to hit the
ball farther and harder.

Now Sammy Sosa said it was
an “honest mistake” and that he
was using the bat that he usually
uses for batting practice, but can
we really believe that?

Sosa is currently‘ in 4th place
for total career homeruns with
609. How many of those do you
think he used his “batting prac-
tice” bat for? We will never
know if it was an honest mistake
or intentional cheating but we
do know Sammy Sosa made the
third dumbest play in sports his-
tory, and that is not even consid-
ering his probable steroid use...

Some fans take wins and loss-
es a lot harder than the athletes
themselves do. So I am includ-
ing one “fan” in my list: Steve

Bartman, who made the second
dumbest play in sports.

He claims to be a Chicago

A brand-new stadium, a local oppo-
nent, under the lights for the ﬁrst time.
The scene was perfect.

The crowd of nearly 3,000 gathered

I at the new Wilson Field on Saturday

night should have known that something
special was going to happen.

And happen it did. In one of the most
exciting games in program history, the
Washington and Lee Generals came
from behind in the ﬁnal six minutes to
beat Buena Vista’s Southern Virginia
Knights 35-28 in the ﬁrst home night
game in W&L football history.

The Generals had to ﬁght every
inch of the way and were frustratingly
stonewalled on several chances to take
a more convincing lead against an SVU
team that had never played their cross-
county rivals before. The Knights play
most of their football games in the Na-
tional Association for Intercollegiate
Athletics (NAIA), a sister organization
to the NCAA for smaller schools, and
have only had a varsity football program
since 2003. Thus it was the ﬁrst edition
of the Rockbridge Rivalry, and from the
looks of Saturday’s game, it should not
be the last.

The fans were passionate, loud and
involved on both sides of the new sta-
dium. The teams were fairly evenly
matched and even have similar offen-
sive styles. Except for two drives where
the Generals, trailing by a touchdown,
went almost exclusively through the air,
both squads are run-ﬁrst teams.

Saturday was a tale of the schools’
two outstanding running backs: W&L’s
Stuart Sitterson and SVU’s Marcus Mc-
Collum. Both players were easily the
studs of their respective squads. McCol-
lum, despite being the number two run-
ning back on the SVU depth chart and
handling the ball only nine times (Harry
Collins, the nominal number one, rushed
seventeen times), ran over, around and
through the W&L run defense for an av-
erage of 8.6 yards per carry.

Running primarily delays and draws,
McCollum was rarely stopped by the
ﬁrst W&L tackler to reach him. His
combination of size, speed and power
was devastating. Sitterson, running a
combination of quick dives and options,
had 169 yards and two rushing touch-
downs. Overall, the Knights outgained
the Generals 475 yards to 365. In no
game this year have the Generals gained
more yards than their opponent.

But ultimately, the result was made
by a couple of key plays in the second
half that built to one of the most excit-
ing ﬁnishes in W&L history. Following
Charlie Westfal’s 2-yard touchdown
run to put the Generals up 21-14, W&L
linebackers Matt Cassilly and Chris Bal-
lantyne stopped SVU quarterback Sam
Trulock short of the ﬁrst down marker
on 4th-and-7.

With the ball back and a chance to
take a two-touchdown lead, the ﬁrst for
either team in the game, the opportunity
was lost when W&L fullback Harrison
Hudson fumbled the football and SVU
recovered. On the ensuing drive, Mc-
Collum broke away on 4th-and-2 for a
39-yard touchdown. The score was now
tied at 21 with 12:43 left on the clock.

The Generals then failed on a 4th-

" Generals outlast Knights

Behind RB Stuart Sitterson is two touchdowns,
the Generals came back to beat Southern
Virginia 35-28 in ﬁnal two minutes in the new

down conversion of their own when the
officials gave a questionable spot to Stu-
art Sitterson’s rush over the collapsing
offensive line. It appeared to.W&L fans
that Sitterson had reached the mark, but
the sideline ofﬁcial thought differently
and SVU regained the ball with 10:35
to go.

Trulock marched his team down
the ﬁeld, using up plenty of the expir-
ing clock, threw a 37-yard touchdown
pass, and just like that, the visitors were
leading by a touchdown with 6: 14 leﬁ to
play. Forlorn Generals fans thought then
that tying the game was not out of reach
but it seemed unlikely that the Blue-and-
White could score twice, and stop Mc-
Collum and Trulock, in just six minutes

I of play.

But the next play changed the entire
equation. Sitterson, back to receive the
kickoff, fumbled his ‘catch and had to
run backwards to his own 6-yard line.
With the defense closing in on him, Sit-
terson picked the ball up, out to his left,
outran several would-be tacklers, cut
back inside, made the ﬁnal two SVU de-
fenders missed and racked up a 94-yard
kick return for a touchdown. Instantly,
the home fans were back in the game
and the score was tied, 28-28. Follow-
ing as it did the Hudson fumble, the
Knights’ methodical drive and Tru1ock’s
touchdown pass, the return was one of
the most electrifying and invigorating
plays in recent W&L history.

Inspired by their teammate, the W&L
defense came out with a vengeance,
forcing a punt by SVU’s Stephen Web-
ster after Trulock went three-and-out,
W&L was unable to gain much trac-
tion on the ensuing possession and were
forced to punt as well. SVU’s Kyle Nel-
son fumbled the punt was able to dive
on it before W&L could recover. The
fansithought they had had their break.
But two plays 1ater’the‘Knights ran the
option to the right and Trulock threwithe
toss behind Collins. W&L’s David Love
pounced on the loose ball and W&L now
had possession, with a chance to win the
game, with 1:20 leﬁ.

But it didn’t take nearly’ that long,
as Sitterson electriﬁed the crowd again
on theﬁrst play of the drive, running 31
yards for a Generals touchdown. Tru-
lock now had 1:10 to drive down the
ﬁeld and tie the game. But W&L place-
kicker Tommy Kennedy, always will-
ing to make the game more interesting,
sent the kickoff out of bounds, and SVU
started their drive at their own 40 yard
line. Donovan Sawyer was then called
for defensive pass interference and the
officials placed the ball at the W&L 29-
yard line. ,

With 20 seconds remaining, the
Knights tried a trick play, handing the
ball off to Collins who pulled up and
threw towards the end zone. The pass
was too long for his target, and Sawyer
made amends by intercepting the throw
in the end zone for a touchback.

One kneel-down later the game was
over, the Generals having snatched vic-
tory from the jaws of defeat, winning
35-28. Those fans who left at halﬁime
are surely regretting their decision, as
they missed perhaps themost exciting
fourth quarter in W&L football history.

It was an auspicious beginning to the
Rockbridge Rivalry and to the new Wil-
son Field.

have stolen the ball from the

trol of the game and were 5 outs
away from reaching the World
Series when Louis Castillo hit a

ﬂy ball down the left ﬁeld foul
line, right where Steve Bartman
was sitting.

Both Alou, the Cubs leﬂ

“fan,” went for the ball. They
both had their own motivations,
Alou to win the game and Bart-
man, to get a free souvenir. And
a free souvenir it was. The Cubs
went on to lose the game and the
series and Bartman went on to a
life of shame in the smallest town

But the most bone-headed
play in the history of sports be-

to North Carolina, Webber re-

remaining in the game. Webber
started dribbling the ball, he
crossed midcourt, he ran over to
his team’s bench, and to plan the
last play with 11 seconds leﬁ he
called timeout.

One problem: His Michigan
team was out of timeouts. The
technical foul and free throws
for North Carolina put the game
away and the Championship
went to the Tar Heels. _

Webber after the ‘game said,
“I just called the timeout and that
probably cost us the game.” Ap-
parently Chris Webber has a very
loose deﬁnition of probably. The
ocean probably contains a lot
of water, the grass is probably

tates around the sun, but really,‘
who knows for sure?

Recounting sports’ dumbest plays

Jackson is sports ’newest bone head after MNF celebration mishap

By Chris Schneck
STAFF WRITER

The world of sports provides us with
an inﬁnite amount of heroes. As young
kids we grew up impersonating the great-
est athletes in the world — doing Tiger
Woods’ patented ﬁst pump as we drain a
putt, sticking out our tongue as we make
a layup pretending to be his Aimess, Mi-
chael Jordan, or even pointing our bat to
the outﬁeld calling our own shot in the
neighborhood whifﬁe ball game a la Babe
Ruth. Images such as these and the games
that accompany them will stay with us for-
ever.

These players and others have provided
role models for youth and even adults for
hundreds of years, teaching us work ethic,
teamwork and dedication. Other athletes
and sports personas make their name by
being the dumbest, the most idiotic, the
biggest bone-heads.

‘ So my question is,_who have made the
dumbest plays in sports history?

Sports are good for many reasons in-
cluding providing American viewers with
a very goodlist of things never to do. Take
last week’s Monday Night Football game
for instance.

It was an important division game be-
tween division rivals, the Philadelphia Ea-
gles and the Dallas Cowboys. The winner
of the game would take the lead in argu-
ably, the toughest division in football. The

game was close throughout, but Dallas
won in the end by a score of 4'1 -37.

But the actual game was outshined by
the actions of one man, DeSean Jackson,
who put his team’s success at risk. In the
second quarter McNabb dropped back and
threw a deep ball to a wide open Jackson.
The Eagles were going to score and take
the lead back from the Cowboys. Jack-
son proceeded to waltz into the end zone

Jackson was playing in the All-American
game, where similar to Monday night

his quarterback dropped back, threw the

ball to Jackson, and it seemed as though
Jackson would score a touchdown. But, in
celebration for his “touchdown,” he swan
dove for the endzone starting at the ﬁve
yardline, needless to say, he didn’t make
it. And he received a 15 yard unsportsman
like conduct penalty for his actions.

My question is, who have made the dumbest plays in

sports history? Sports are good for many reasons includ-

ing providing American viewers with a very good list of

things never to do.

untouched for an apparent’ touchdown,
except for one thing: he forgot to take the
football with him.

In celebration of his “touchdown,”
he ﬂicked the ball into the air before he
crossed the end line thus voiding the
touchdown. That’s like pulling the cord on
your parachute while still in the airplane
and then jumping.

But DeSean Jackson should have known
better, not because of common sense or
logic, but rather that this was the second
time he did this! As a senior in high school

So much from learning from your mis-
takes DeSean. But at least you are the
most recent addition to the dumbest plays
in sports.

Athletes’ schoolwork and learning usu-
ally take a back seat during high school
and college to sports. Many times profes-
sors and teachers are more than willing to
simply give star athletes a good grade. But
Larry Walker should have paid a little more
attention in math class during school. He

Field Hockey earns ﬁrst win

Team beats Catholic 1-0 in fourth overtime game of season

By Will Dorrance and Llzz Dye
SPORTS EDITOR & STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee University
ﬁeld hockey team was 0-4 entering Satur-
day’s home game against Catholic Univer-
sity. All four of those losses were by one
goal; three of them went into overtime.

It seems only ﬁtting that the Lady
Generals won their ﬁrst game of the sea-
son by one goal in overtime. Junior for-
ward Christina Merchant scored to end
the game just 54 seconds into overtime to
hand W&L the 1-0 victory.

The close match was a showcase of
strong defensive play as the game saw
combined only six shots on goal. Junior
keeper Caroline Habliston made two saves
for the Generals while earning her ﬁrst
shutout of the season. The Cardinals ju-
nior netminder Marian Cassilly registered
four saves in her team’s second loss of the

season.
As the horn blew to signal the end of
regulation, the Generals knew they still

While we had a tough
beginning of the season,
we ’ve improved in each
game and we really came
together as a team for the
win.

had some work to do in overtime. Junior
Steph Mansey said, “It was a little nerve-
wracking going into our fourth overtime

of the season of ﬁve games, but I had con-
ﬁdence in my teammates and I’m glad that
we could pull through for a win.”

The game-winning goal came off of
W&L’s only second offensive comer of
the game. Merchant deflected junior cap-
tain Sallie Arrnstrong’s shot into Catholic’s
cage to end the sudden-death overtime.‘

Merchant’s goal gave the Generals
their ﬁrst win, and the team hopes it will
provide much-needed momentum as they
head off to a 1:00 p.m. bout Saturday with
two-time defending conference champion
Lynchburg College for their ODAC-sea-
son opener.

“While we had a tough beginning of the
season, we’ve improved in each game and
we really came together as a team for the
win,” said sophomore midﬁelder Emmy
Mathews.
