Long overdue

After over I 50 years, one
book has made its way back
to the Leyburn shelves

By Victoria Taylor
S TA F F W R IT E R

And you think you hold on to your library books
for a long time.

After 52,858 days, the ﬁrst volume of “History of
the War in the Peninsula and in the South of France”
by W.F.P. Napier found its way back to the shelves
of Leyburn Library.

The book was taken by Union solider C.S. Gates
on June 11, 1864, when General David Hunter and
his army of West Virginia looted the area and set ﬁre
to the Virginia Military Institute.

Mike Dau, the head handball coach at Lake For-
rest College in Illinois, returned the book in Febru-
ary.
He inherited it from Myron and Isabel Gates, a
childless Lake Forrest couple and Dau’s long-time
friends. While visiting relatives in the Washington
area, Dau and his wife Paula took the trip to Lexing-
ton to deliver the book in person.

“It was a handshake and here’s your book,” Dau
said. “From that point on, this story has taken on a

“All I did was return a book that
was long overdue. It is really [the
Gates ’] story, not mine. I just hap-
pened to be the [book is] caretaker ”

life of its own.”

Although Dau returned the book a few months
ago, the story has recently garnered a lot of media
attention. Major newspapers like The Washington
Post and The Chicago Tribune published articles
about Dau’s story. It was also covered by the British
Broadcasting Company’s radio show, National Pub-
lic Radio’s “All Things Considered” and by CBS, to
name a few.

Dau said that the media attention was a little un-
expected.

“All I did was return a book that was long over-
due,” he said. “It’s really [the Gates’] story, not mine.
I just happened to be the [book’s] caretaker.”

Dau got in touch with Laura Turner, Leybum
Library’s technical services librarian, through W&L
alumnus Harry Goodheart ’66, a North Carolina
book dealer. Turner determined that the book be-
longed to W&L, despite a note inside the book in
which Gates remarks that he stole it from VMI.

In addition to having Washington College written
on the cover page, the book also matches volume
two of the four-volume set of “History of the War
in the Peninsula and in the South of France” in the
library’s vault.

Although the library catalog did not indicate that
the book was missing, Turner noticed that the origi-
nal volumes must have been replaced because vol-
ume two was not a gift to the library like the others
in the vault. Volume two also had a different spine
than the others that matched that of Dau’s book.

Turner said she thinks the story fascinates a lot
of people because of the time period it involves. She
said that the library lost more than half of its vol-
umes during Hunter’s Raid but was able to get over
1000 back right after the Civil War. As far as she
knows, Dau’s book is the ﬁrst one since the years
following the war that has been returned.

_ Dau did not have to pay any ﬁnes and joked about
the fact that he gave back a stolen book.

“I was happy that they weren’t going to press
charges,” Dau said.

 

STUDENTS AND

FOR THE STUDENTS SINCE

Students worry their interests are not protected,
start petition to call student body meeting with EC

By Allison Chopin
MANAGING EDITOR

Students may get the chance make sub-
stantial changes to Washington and Lee’s
honor system policies and make history this
Spring Term, if student leaders and the Ex-
ecutive Committee manage to call a student
body meeting and draw a quorum of 1,000
students.

The March 30 issue of the Ring-tum Phi,
containing opinion pieces that questioned re-
cently elected EC President Eric Hoffman’s
campaign promises, was a factor in prompt-
ing seniors Anthony Ives and Regina Mills to
start a petition to call this meeting. But Ives
said it also came from a “feeling we’ve been
getting all year” that the EC and other bodies
protecting the honor system were failing to
fully represent the student body.

Ives and Mills said they feel that there
is a lack of communication between the EC
and the student body. They acknowledge that
some information cannot be shared publicly,
but they do not believe that the judicial body
charged with protecting W&L’s honor should
be shrouded in mystery.

“Things that could be transparent are be-
ing totally swept under the rug,” Ives said.

Ives admitted that new EC Secretary Bill
Larson has done a better job in keeping and
publishing the minutes of EC meetings, but
he pointed out that no honor investigations
have been made public since February 1.
The White Book states that this informa-
tion should be posted on the ﬁrst day of each
month.

They added that the EC does not publi-
cize that they are willing to be more trans-
parent. “I’m a senior, and I never knew that
EC meetings were open,” Mills said.

Another troubling point for Ives and Mills
is the process of amending the White Book,
which details procedures regarding the hon-
or system. A White Book Review Commit-
tee is appointed by the EC to examine the
honor system and suggest changes every
three years, including this year. The com-
mittee is expected to consider the opinions
of the W&L community in this process. This
could be a valuable chance for any student
to propose a change, but according to Mills,
this year’s committee held few public meet-
ings, and the meetings were not adequately
advertised and were poorly attended.

“They assumed no one would come,"

 VOLUME CXII,

Amendmentstothe  

A. Strike out the following language In the Philosophy
section of the introduction:

"The Honor System condemns only acts that the
current student generation views as breachesof the
community is trust, and although dishonorable conduct
cannot be codiﬁed, lying, cheating and stealing have
historically been found to be examples of breaches of
the Honor System. "

Replace with:

“The Honor System condemns acts that the current
student generation views as breaches of the communi-
tyiv trust and cannot be codiﬁed. Although the system
has historically given examples of dishonorable acts
this has given rise to the impression that those ex-

amples represented an exhaustive list of dishonorable '

conduct. This is NOT the case. lnfact, ANY breach of
the communityis trust represents an Honor Violation. ”

3. Add the following line at the conclusion of the first .

paragraph of the conﬁdentiality and Harassment section
of Enforcement Procedure:

“Any Executive Committee member who is removed
from oﬁice shall not be eligible to run for any Execu~
tive Committee position in the first election subsequent
to his or her removal. ”

C. Replace:

“The Executive Committee shall give consideration
to any proposal for amendment to the White Book that
is submitted on proper motion by any member of the ,
Executive Committee, any student with an accompa-
nying petition signed by at least fifty current students,
or the White Book Review Committee. The Executive
Committee may adopt such an amendment to the White

Campus Kitchens Project expands by mainting a campus garden beneﬁting the project

Receiving help from its clients, the
Campus Kitchens Project (CKP) has
been working on an on-campus gar-
den that is located behind the Pavil-
ion. The garden was originally used
in biology experiments, but starting
last school year, it has been used to
grow fresh produce for the CKP.

Environment Management Coor-
dinator Chris Wise and Biology pro-
fessor Bill Hamilton are in charge of
running the garden, said CKP Coordi-
nator Jenny Sproul.

“They have a lot of vision with the
garden,” she said. “It’s looking more
like a garden than it was before.”

Before, the CKP was not involved
in the actual garden working but sim-
ply received vegetables that were
produced in the garden. But this year,
it has taken some initiatives and has
been taking a group of students to
work in the garden for about 15-18
hours each week.

“The coolest part of the garden is
that it’s not just students but clients

;.

are also helping out,” said Sproul.
Clients from the Robert E. Lee
low-income apartments join the stu-
dents every Thursday morning and
contribute to the garden working.
James West, a resident of the Rob-
ert E. Lee apartments, has also been

access to and the more
volunteers we have, the

more people we can

serve. ’

Jenny Sproul, Campus Kitchens
Project Coordinator

helping the garden work since Febru-
ary.

“It’s hard work, but it has been
nice,” said West. “I’ve got nothing
else to do. I don’t mind working.”

Sproul said it is a rewarding expe-
rience for the clients to work on the
garden from which they receive the
ingredients that make up their meals.
So far, they have planted tomatoes,

squash, corn, herbs and peppers. The
CKP plans to grow more food such as
blueberries and carrots.

In addition to the garden work-
ing, students are also building a fence
around the garden so that ground
hogs would not rummage through the
garden and ruin it.

“The hope is that we’ll get more
out of it,” said Sproul.

The CKP usually receives prepared
food from dining services, and the
fresh produce from the garden will be
a fun experiment, she said. For agen-
cies that are too far from Washington
and Lee to come to the garden regu-
larly, Sproul said the CKP is planning
to organize ﬁeld trip activities, which
would be a good way to reach out to
the Rockbridge Area community

For the upcoming summer, a time
when there are fewer volunteers,
the CKP is recruiting students in re-
search, Shepherd Poverty interns,
Bonner leaders, cadets from work-
release program, and youth groups of
church.

“I feel like the summer will go re-
ally well,” said Sproul.

Another on-going program of the
CKP is the work-release program in
cooperation with the Natural Bridge
Juvenile Correction Center. A cadet
came to Washington and Lee at the
end of last November, and he has
been working 17 hours a week with
the CKP and 8 hours a week with the
Co-op. He is to be released in June
and will; receive a certiﬁcate from
ServSafe program that provides com-
prehensive food safety training.

Sproul said the work-release pro-
gram intends to teach cadets life-long
skills that they will be able to use af-
ter their release. The CKP will contin-
ue working with cadets one at a time
until they are released.

CKP’s other future plans include
holding nutrition classes for clients
and receiving food from Virginia
Military Institute.

“The more food we have access
to and the more volunteers we have,
the more people we can serve,” said
Sproul.

Tying the community together

One senior and C C C work to ease relations between students and residents

By Ted Moore
STAFF WRITER

If Dean Dawn Watkins of
Washington and Lee University
had another child, she said, she
would name him after Garrett
Clark.

Clark, a W&L senior, teamed
up with Watkins and local retired
attorney Fred Massey to lead the
Campus-Community Coalition
(CCC). The CCC, which origi-
nally started in 2004 through a
Virginia ABC grant to promote
alcohol education and prevention
at W&L, now takes on a much
larger mission which many W&L
students are unaware of—bring-
ing the community together.

Local residents, police, and
W&L student and administrative
leaders have monthly meetings
to discuss conflicting interests
in the Lexington community,
including problems arising from
W&L’s social scene.

Watkins, who is W&L’s Dean
of Students and Vice President
of Student Affairs, said Clark
approached her at the end of his
freshman year about joining the
CCC with the positive mindset
of I get it, I see how it can work,
I want in.

At this time, Clark worried
about the future of the W&L so-
cial scene as Rockbridge County
proposed a noise ordinance that
would have made it a county
law to cut off loud music at mid-
night.

“I was surprised by this ex-
treme measure,” Clark said.

The following fall, Clark ac-

companied Watkins and W&L’s
EC president to speak at the
Rockbridge Board of Supervi-
sors meeting when the proposed
ordinance was discussed. Clark
said the noise ordinance did not
get passed with the understand-
ing that W&L students would be
assuming more responsibility to
neighbors through the expansion
and development of the CCC.

“I view it as a balancing act,”
said Watkins.

great goals with enthusiastic
leaders who say they want an
“open forum” for discussion,
many W&L students have never
heard of the coalition that is now
in its ﬁfth year.

Some students even believe
that the relationship between 10-
cal police and W&L students is
worse than ever with recent po-
lice visits to the Windfall Hill
area that have resulted in drink-
ing related tickets and arrests.

“There is always going to be tension with

students and residents and the police. Our

goal is to recognize it, be proactive about it,

and have it be a healthy tension. ”

Dawn Watklns, Dean of Students and Vice Presldent of

Student Affalrs

The balancing act consists of
students’ desire to be leﬂ alone
on the weekends, neighbors’
desires to limit trash, noise and
traffic violations and the police’s
responsibility to safety and en-
forcing the laws.

“There is always going to be
tension with students and resi-
dents and police,” Watkins said.
“Our goal is to recognize it, be
proactive about it, and have it be
a healthy tension.”

Although the CCC has

Although Associate Dean of
Students Brandon Dotson said
the number of drinking viola-
tions among W&L students has
not gone up this year, Clark
agrees with the general student
view that the local police can be
tough on W&L students.

Clarke hopes students living
in off-campus houses will im-
prove relations with their neigh-
bors and reach the point where
there will be no need for anyone
to call the police.

“In general, especially in
[Rockbridge County], the police
do a really good job of targeting
W&L students for drinking vio-
lations,” said Clark. “The point
of the CCC is not to please po-
lice, but to avoid interacting with
police in the ﬁrst place.”

Ted Kingsbury, a W&L se-
nior who also has attended
CCC meetings for several years,
agreed with Clark’s priority of
improving neighbor relations in
the county.

“The biggest problem is the
disconnect between students and
neighbors,” Kingsbury said.

After recruiting neighbors
from student partying areas to
regularly attend CCC meetings,
Clark says the CCC has expand-
ed a lot since his freshman year.

“This is a young organization
that is now on its feet,” Clark
said.

At last Thursday’s CCC
meeting, Clark, Massey and
Kingsbury worked out an agree-
ment with neighbors to compile
a list during the spring term of
all the names, phone numbers,
and housing addresses of stu-
dents living off-campus for next
school year, so neighbors can
contact students directly with
their problems instead of going
to police or a landlord.

In addition, neighbors have
agreed to accompany Clark to
fraternity and sorority houses
this spring around dinner time to
meet students and spread aware-

NFL Commisioner Robert Goodell responds to a panel on the trying times

The troubled economy cre-
ates problems for national sports
leagues, just like any other in-
dustry.

NFL Commissioner Robert
Goodell addressed this and other
questions from Washington and
Lee students in a panel in Lee
Chapel last Tuesday, April 21.

Three student athletes and

James Parrino, a senior football

said Ives. “But they didn’t
give the opportunity for stu-
dents to get involved.”

Mills said that part of the
problem lies with students who
do not seek out the chance to
voice their opinions, but she
also blames the EC for not en-
couraging discussion. “The EC
has a much bigger platform to
get people involved,” she said.

In addition to transparency
and student input, the two
would like to reexamine the
deﬁnition of honor at W&L.
Honor violations are typically
deﬁned as encompassing “ly—
ing, cheating and stealing,” but
Ives said this “minimal deﬁni-
tion” is “not acceptable.”

“We have lowered our ex-
pectations,” he said.

Other concerns the two have
raised range from voter turnout
in elections to the treatment of
sexual assault within the honor
system.

He said the EC plans to ad-

but not impossible,” he said.

ness of the CCC and its mission.

Clark also has responded to
one of the neighbors’ chief con-
cerns of trash in the county by
leading several massive pickups
throughout the year.

Although Clark has encour-
aged neighbors to help out in
these efforts, male W&L stu-
dents alone have outnumbered
local participants this year by a
ratio of 20 or 30 to one.

Neighbors who initially com-
plained in March about the trash
near the Pole Houses were reas-
sured after Clark announced an-
other student pickup was sched-
uled for the following Saturday.

“We have come a long way
but [seeing trash on the ground]
eats away at the good feeling,”
one neighbor said. “We don’t
want to lose goodwill on either
side.”

Massey, who brings a neigh-
bor’s perspective to the CCC
leadership, defended the efforts
of Clark and other students who
have been instrumental in im-
proving community relations.

“When we started getting

student leadership in Garrett and
Ted, things started getting a lot
better,” said Massey.

Clark, who graduates this
spring, said that the CCC is now
established as “the jaws of the
operation” for dealing with com-
munity tension, and he hopes
students involved in the coalition
will speak on it from a student’s
perspective during next year’s
Orientation Week to raise aware-
ness.

Watkins believes that contin-
ued strong student leadership in
the CCC will help W&L students
living off-campus become better
neighbors.

“We will always be teaching
[the principle of] ‘town-gown’
or living together,” Watkins said.
“If there wasn’t room for im-
provement, I would not be em-
ployed.”

W&L students need to end their apathy towards advocacy

Too many efforts to support minority groups at the school are ignored; it is sad only the controversial grab our attention

By Jean Chapman
COLUMNIST

I recently had a conversation
with a ﬁiend of mine who is a
very active member and organizer
of the MSA. She was frustrated at
one point by what I would describe
as this campus’s homogeneously-
focused attitudes, and during
our conversations she noted that
“everyone has culture.”

It was a valid point, and that
one quick comment stuck with
me for a while.

It’s really easy to think of our
culture as something deﬁned by
the color of our skin or our native
country. To be honest (perhaps
harsh), we also live in a country
that likes to deﬁne things that
way. If you are not a white, male,

native-born American you are
considered different from the
expected norm. A norm, I might
add, that doesn’t really exist.

The past few weeks (and the
past months) have been laden with
reminders of and celebrations of
the “othemess” in culture that can
sometimes get lost in mainstream
American society.

The entire month of February
was dedicated to the remembrance
of Black History and Black heroes;
in March our campus celebrated
Love Your Body Week; National
Holocaust Remembrance Day
was observed on April 21; and
from April 27-May 1 the GSA
will be engaging its annual “Gay?
Fine by me” campaign.

Many of these things were
somewhat ignored by the

campus, or at least it feels that
way to me. I don’t really recall
any awareness of Black History
Month as it occurred, though
perhaps something was occurring
in commemoration. Though
Holocaust Remembrance Day was
celebrated in DC with speeches
and solemn vigils, I didn’t know
it had happened until I Googled
it.

Love Your Body Week, as many
of us know, caused something of
an uproar on campus. What it did
do, however, was galvanize a lot
of previously apathetic people
and get people talking. People
saw post secrets and sympathized,
then shared their own; people saw
real women’s bodies outlined
on campus with important
information, and reacted when

they were taken down. For once
in the two years I’ve been at this
university, we did not sweep issues
under the rug. Sketch comedy
group WNL’s fabulous tour guide
skit (look it up on YouTube if you
didn’t go see it) gave the drama of
the week a humorous twist, but it
also showed the impact that Love
Your Body Week had.

As the “Gay? Fine by me”
campaign comes up, I would
love to see some of the same
impact. Obviously, I don’t want
to see signs taken down or people
disrespected, but I would love
for people to take notice and
actually give a damn about what
the campaign means. I would
love the same thing to have been
true for Black History Month
and Holocaust Remembrance

Day as well. I know as well as
any that we’re busy as students;
we all have a lot of work, a lot of
extracurriculars, and then we’d all
like to unwind and have a bit of
ftm. I get that, but having a busy
schedule is no excuse for apathy.

Though I’m in danger of
sounding a little trite, I want to go
back to what that friend of mine
said: “everybody has culture.”

That is to say, everyone
has their own story, their own
experiences, and their own
background. We have to realize
that every one of us is probably a
minority in some way.

You can tell race and gender
by looking at someone, sure. But
you can’t see their religion, their
political views, their sexuality,
their family’s heritage, or what

they’ve been through in their life.
As our post secrets showed us,
we don’t always know everything
about the people who are closest
to us, either.

So, whenever you see another
poster on campus trying to raise
your awareness, let it.

Read the signs, think about
them, and internalize what it
means when you read about
women on this campus, LGBT
suicide rates, or even historical
events.

Respect different cultures,
different genders, and different
sexualities, but take one step more
by paying attention and really
involving your emotions.

It doesn’t really take any time,
it just takes a little effort.

a great trio, Spring Term is a
wonderful time.

After all, when else in your
life can you go tubing at noon on
a Monday?

But when spring rolls
around next year, it looks like
underclassmen will be enjoying a
very different spring experience.

Next year marks the beginning
of new four week spring terms,
and the university is embarking
on an intensive plan to remodel

and revitalize our famous spring
semester.

With the exception of a few
well-established programs like
New York or Washington Terms,
as well as a few overseas trips,
nearly every class offered in the
new spring term will be a new and
improved.

The current option of taking
three or six credits will disappear;
all students will take one intensive
class that meets 8-10 hours a
week and will involve 20-25
hours a week of work outside of
the classroom.

So I guess it falls to all of us
to make the best of our ﬁnal six-
week spring term. Go tubing on
that Monday (I did last week).
Buy a pool at Wal—Mart and
set it up in your front yard for
afternoon hang-out sections.
Move that “Ping Pong” table to
your deck or porch. Take a road

trip in two weeks and watch the
baseball team make their ﬁrst
ever appearance in the NCAA
tournament.

Intellectually and objectively,
I know the change should be a
good one for Washington and
Lee. Let’s face it; if you just
take one three credit class, these
six weeks can often be a bit of
a joke. The new, more intensive
classes should offer students and
professors greater opportunities
for research, ﬁeld trips and other
activities that often get left out
during the longer terms.

But if this going to work,
professors need to embrace the
school’s call to create new courses
rather than taking the current six
week courses and condensing
them into four weeks. Some of
the proposed courses have been

posted on the school’s Quality
Enhancement Plan Web site — qep.
wlu.edu. And while many of them
look interesting, the majority of
the courses up there are currently
offered in our six week term.

I fully understand why
President Ken Ruscio pushed
last fall for the switch to a four
week spring term. Since students
can take two classes under the
current system, the school was
having trouble getting enough
professors and courses to meet
the required spring load. Ruscio,
recognizing that he would either
have to change or abolish Spring
Term, proposed this tighter, more
intense term.

I know the increased class
time and homework load — when
coupled with two fewer weeks
of tubing, camping and strolling

around in seersucker — will make
students unhappy. Heck, if I were
going to be around next year, I
might be unhappy too.

Hopefully students will
manage to keep some perspective
about the change. After all, the
choice was really between a four
week spring term or no spring
term at all.

And, as much as it pains us to
think about this, we really don’t
come to college for tubing on the
Maury. Our parents are paying all
of this money so we can get some
sort of education, and I think the
new term will be a more effective
was of helping students learn.

If professors will put in the
effort needed to design new
courses that take advantage of
our uniquely ﬂexible schedule,
you could see American history

students spending their term at
Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello
and the National Archives in
Washington, D.C., learning about
the Declaration of Independence
on site instead of in a Colonnade
classroom. Language students can
go to D.C. for a foreign language
ﬁlm festival or a play without
having to worry about missing
their other class.

If this new plan works, the
possibilities really might be
endless.

I know all of this. I understand
it. But yeah, deep down in my
heart, I’ll still feel bad for those
students who will miss two weeks
of tubing, grilling and getting
away from reality. Spring term
as we know it is coming to an
end. Don’t let this last one go to
waste.

Dialogue very important in ensuring the Honor System lives

The newly-seated EC I/ice President responds to the recent furor over EC transperancy, welcomes student discussion

By Scott Centorlno
c o L u M N I s T
200. That is how many

students have joined a Facebook
group titled “We the People-
Student Body Meeting.” It is the
equivalent of about 15 fraternity
pledge classes. It is not a number
to be ignored on such a small
campus.

At W&L, if only single a
student stands up and offers
concern or an idea about the
Honor System or student life, the
EC should listen. In this group,
there are 200 concerned students.
The EC should listen.

I have heard the EC described
as “a responsive body.” Well, it’s
time to respond.

I do not agree with every
proposed phrase nor every
statement of concern. However,
I do agree that a student body at
rest is a student body regressing.
This is an opportunity for student
leaders to take account of an
alert student body, one which
genuinely has the capacity to care
and the will to act.

Many have described the

student body or even the EC
as apathetic - willing to push
aside real dialogue about student
governance for fear of looking
‘uncool.’ I disagree. I believe
students have a genuine faith in
their representative trustees on
the EC and have faith that good
people will make good decisions.
Also, as someone who has been
through countless hours of parsing
over the placement of a single
word in the White Book, I can tell
you there is more often too much
dialogue, rather than too little, on
your Executive Committee.

As a member of the Executive
Committee, I see this group
not as an attack, but as a simple
question- “What are you doing
to improve W&L?” That is not a
question any EC should be afraid
to answer.

Of course, such questions
become easier to answer when
an EC can point to tangible
accomplishments. This year, I
believe the EC has an opportunity
to make genuine progress. Some
of that progress, you should see.

For example, the EC should
lookintoconcemsaboutprocedure

regarding the University Board
of Appeals. But more important
than possible technical problems,
the EC should think of the big
picture in terms of student self-
governance.

Similarly, sexual assault has
been a buzzword on this campus
for as long as I’ve been here.
However, nothing ever seems to
change. Obviously, it is a difﬁcult
problem to solve, one which one
person or one plan could certainly
not ﬁx. For the most part, it is a
cultural and social issue. This
EC owes it to students to help
administrators and students
increase the effectiveness of the
Student Faculty Hearing Board.

However, some genuine
progress may be lost in the
meeting minutes outside the
Co-Op. The greatest work for
the Honor System is often lost
to most, either in the sensitive
conﬁdentiality of Honor hearings
or in the technical jargon of
the White Book. However, in
that which is lost, we can ﬁnd
strength. The White Book Review
Committee has offered almost 40
amendments to the White Book,

almost all of which would make it
a healthier document.

During this EC’s tenure, I plan
to propose amendments to the
White Book which I believe will
strengthen not only the document,
but the Honor System. While
I support these amendments,
reasonable minds may differ and
I encourage opposite viewpoints.

One amendment changes the
system by which EC presidents
appoint members to ﬁll positions
on the EC during closed
hearings.

Currently, EC presidents can
appoint anyone to ﬁll a vacant
seat (often due to recusals) during
a closed hearing. While I have
never had any issues with past
appointees, I believe the Honor
System deserves a better method.

My amendment requires
the EC president to nominate a
student to be appointed, and then
approved by a majority of the
remaining members of the EC.
This rejuvenates the democratic
nature of closed hearings and
helps future ECs defend verdicts in
which appointees were involved.
At best, this will only improve

the caliber of appointees and, at
worst, will serve as a comforting
and important formality.

Another amendment I plan to
propose creates a “Community
Outreach Committee” to help
improve student awareness
about the Honor System. I was
impressed when a group of
Honor Advocates offered the idea
originally, and I have altered it
to streamline its purpose so as to
not overlap with the White Book
Review Committee.

While the White Book
Review Committee does address
community outreach, it only
convenes every three years and
already has its hands full sifting
through the White Book. The
Community Outreach Committee
will serve to inform students
every year about all aspects of the
Honor System. It will deliver a
consistent and coherent message
to students and, simultaneously,
better inform the EC of student
opinion and knowledge.

These changes may seem
small, but considering the
enormous historical success of
the Honor System, small changes

are often the only right changes.

Some may call me idealistic
for writing an article in the Phi
about these things, perhaps
believing students do not care or
simply will not understand. We
can understand and we will care
when we realize we should.

If you have an opinion about
any of these ideas, contact
your Executive Committee
representatives and share your
feelings. EC members deserve
your opinion and you deserve
their open minds.

Our student generation has
received the gift of the Honor
System from the students who
came before us.

The system does not survive
by chance, or luck, or because it
perpetuates itself.

It only survives because each
generation collectively sets out to
maintain and improve upon it.

For the thousands of students
who follow us, students we may
never meet, we must continue
that enduring tradition and ﬁrm
commitment to honor.

The gravest threat to the Republican Party is in Arizona

If Chris Simcox can ride a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment to primary victory over McCain, kiss Hispanic votes goodbye

By Abel Delgado
COLUMNIST

If I were a wealthy Democrat
looking to destroy the Republican
Party, there is one senatorial cam-
paign I would donate as much as
possible to: Chris Simcox’s Arizo-
na Republican Primary campaign
against Senator John McCain.

Simcox is the co-founder of
the Minutemen Defense Group,
the anti-immigrant organization
that has volunteered to watch the
U.S.-Mexican border and build
walls that do a better job of keep-
ing Hispanics out of the Repub-
lican Party then they do keeping
illegal immigrants out of country.

My ﬁrst column for the Phi
over two years ago dealt with the
Minutemen and their supporters,

a small but vocal segment of the
party with overtly racist messages
and intentions that made Hispan-
ics across the nation feel unwel-
come.

These thinly disguised bigots
who portrayed themselves as pa-
triots for deciding who had the
right to call themselves Ameri-
can, these people who thought
that having the last name Roberts
made them more deserving of the
American Dream than someone
with the last name Rodriguez,
these people who thought a wall
would solve our problems as if
Jericho’s, China’s, and Berlin’s
did any good - these people made
my blood boil.

I’ve always been teased and
even ridiculed by my liberal
friends for being a Republican but

the only time I ever felt ashamed
to call myself a Republican was
when the anti-immigrant wave
swelled through my party’s
ranks.

Of course, it wasn’t like the
Democrats were exactly “pro-im-
migrant” either and a few Repub-
lican Senators tried their hardest to
come up with a workable solution
to immigration issue. Senators
John McCain, Lindsey Graham,
and Mel Martinez (himself an im-
migrant) were some of the most
inﬂuential supporters of com-
prehensive immigration reform.
McCain especially had plenty to
lose back in 2006 and 2007, when
a pro-immigrant record could
have easily cost him any chance
of winning the Republican Presi-
dential Primary. That didn’t keep

him from standing up for what he
believed in.

No doubt Chris Simcox is now
standing up for what he believes
in. He believes we are in serious
danger because of our lack of
border security. It is hard to ar-
gue with him given recent events
in Mexico. But Simcox misses the
point completely.

If you want to ﬁx the immigra-
tion problem, the drug problem,
the human trafﬁcking problem,
and every other border problem,
the solution starts in Mexico, not
the U.S. And if you want to stop
terrorists, you are paying atten-
tion to the wrong border. Even if
you build a 20 foot wall across the
Mexican border, the only thing
you will get is plenty of twenty-
one-foot ladders.

Republicans should also look
at this practically. Arizona was
blue enough to elect Janet Napol-
itano its governor. Its population
is 30 percent Hispanic. Senator
McCain won reelection in 2004
with 77 percent of the vote, due in
large part to his support within the
Arizonan Hispanic community.
If Simcox somehow manages to
beat McCain he has a snowball’s
chance in hell of winning in the
general election.

Looking at this from a national
perspective, the more attention
Simcox gets the next two years,
the worse Republicans will look
in the eyes of Hispanic voters.
And if President Obama manages
to pass comprehensive immigra-
tion reform without the support of
Republicans, the GOP can forget

about winning the Hispanic vote
for decades. Anyone with a grasp
on US demographics knows that
no party or candidate will suc-
ceed nationally without Hispanic
support. Hispanics should be a
natural constituency for Republi-
cans because of their social val-
ues, strong ties to the military, and
love of the American Dream. But
because of Republican mistakes,
they are not.

It would be an absolute shame
to see such a principled public
servant like Senator McCain go
down in his own party’s primary
for a state he has served honor-
ably.

But beyond being a shame, it
would also be political suicide
for any Republican who actually
wants to win elections.

Welcome back alumni, we hope things are as you left them

Although much has changed at W&L, the current students are making sure our honor and traditions are untouched

By Crlghton Allen
cow M NIST

Alums, welcome back. I have
no doubt that you are deﬁnitely
planning on it, but I encourage
you to take a stroll through cam-
pus. See what’s changed since
you last ventured to Lexington,
like the snazzy renovations done
to the main floor of the library
or, if you missed it in the Fall,
the new, the state-of-the-art Wil-
son Field. If you lived in Baker
Dorm and want to show your
kids your old room, you may be
surprised to ﬁnd a Religion or
History professor‘s ofﬁce occu-
pying the space you once called
home while he waits for New-
comb Hall to be renovated.

Things are deﬁnitely chang-
ing around here - or are they?
These days, I frequently seem to
hear students saying that W&L
seems to be moving away from
the old traditions that used to

deﬁne our school. I’ve thought
about W&L, its history, and its
place in the future a lot lately,
and have come to believe that,
as the old adage goes, the more
things change, the more they
stay the same.

True, maybe the fraternity
system in coming under more
ﬁre these days than it used to,
and certain aspects of our school,
such as gender relations, need
serious attention. But I ﬁrmly
believe that our school and the
students that comprise it have
never been better. Take a min-
ute and reflect on the things that
deﬁne our school, the charac-
teristics that make W&L differ-
ent from every other school out
there. The things that make our
school unique, things like the su-
perior education we receive, the
Honor System and student self-
governance, and a general atmo-
sphere of civility and respect are

still here, alive and as prevalent
as ever.

Our school has always been
about the ﬁrst—class education it
gives its students. That has not,
nor ever will ceased to be the
case. Thanks in part to the gen-
erous support of alums like Mr.
Lenfest, the school can provide
its current faculty with excellent
salary compensation and hope-
fully, this will continue to bring
in even more outstanding pro-
fessors to W&L. The nation’s
best and brightest students have
always chosen to attend W&L,
but now with the Johnson Schol-
arship Program, this further en-
sures that the nation’s top high
school seniors will ﬁght for the
privilege of walking along the
Colonnade as a W&L student.
The new academic minor pro-
gram now will give students ﬁn-
ther room to take advantage the
liberal arts education. W&L kids

rack up scholarships and fellow-
ships, great jobs, and admittance
letters into top graduate schools
like the Cincinnati Bengals foot-
ball team racks up police reports.
It was as true now as it was in
1940; W&L gives its students an
education that can take them as
far as they want to go in life.
For years, a diploma from
W&L has signiﬁed that its hold-
er is not only a person of great
learning, but a person of even
greater character. This is due
to the culture of honor that our
school cultivates through the
unique Honor System. Every
day, students take tests unproc-
tored and leave their belongings
out in the open; these actions that
are so commonplace here are
unheard of at almost any other
campus in the nation. The glue
that holds this Honor System to-
gether, the mutual trust we have
in each other, has been cemented

by the decades it has proven
to be true and effective. In the
rare instances where a breach
of this trust occurs, neither the
faculty nor the administration
handle the infractions. This is
left to the students themselves,
via the Executive Committee of
the Student Body. As long as
there is a W&L, there will be a
community of trust. Nothing,
not the passage of time, nor the
changing values of our society at
large will be able to change this.
When the Class of 2009 cel-
ebrates Commencement in a few
short weeks, the diplomas they
receive will reﬂect as strongly as
ever the features of character and
honor that animate every gradu-
ate of our school.

While this community is not
perfect, I place my utmost in
conﬁdence in our students to ad-
dress the issues that merit atten-
tion and to work to solve them in

order to enhance our school.

Alumni young and old, those
present here for the Alumni
Weekend, and those far away,
I write this column mindful of
W&L’s great past and hopeful
for future bright with prom-
ise. If we here now can achieve
great things, it will be because
you have left us strong legacy
on which to build. If I have one
hope for the returning alumni,
other than you closing down
the party at your old fraternity
house, it is that after interacting
with the students here, you will
continue to be as proud of your
school as you were the day you
graduated.

The deﬁning features of our
school that were in born in its
past are still here and the stu-
dents of today are up to the task
of keeping them alive and strong.
We promise so on our Honor as
Washington and Lee students.

Undergrad voter apathy, not rude e-mails, are the problem

Undergrads have little room to be upset over Eric Hoffman is EC election - only 24% of them bothered with voting

By Jacob Geiger
COLUM NIST

It’s been a strange few years
for the Honor System at Wash-
ington and Lee. April 2007 saw
the ﬁrst open hearing in 12 years,
with the accused student win-
ning his case and being allowed
to stay at W&L.

Last year was partially con-
sumed by a discussion about
whether or not the Executive
Committee — rather than the
Student-Faculty Hearing Board
~ should handle sexual assault
cases, and whether sexual as-
sault could be prosecuted as an
honor violation.

And now we ﬁnd ourselves
facing the ﬁrst Student Body
Meeting in at least ﬁve years.
Student body meetings, for

  

he

Frankly, nearly

inconceivable

those of you unfamiliar with the
arcane workings of the White
Book (i.e. almost everyone) can
be called if 100 students sign a
petition requesting a meeting. If
1,000 students show up, then the
meeting can do everything from
chang the White Book to‘im-
peach members of the EC.
Senior has Anthony Ives or-
ganized such a meeting, which
will be held this coming week.
Ives was upset by E-mails
sent by new EC President Eric
Hoffman to several different law
school groups during the March
EC campaign. In the E-mails,
Hoffman and his friends argued
that he should be elected presi-
dent because law students “can
provide a more informed and
mature point of view” in honor

ttolheetilnr

student body must meet

Failure to muster a quorum will be a failure to care about ourselves

group adequate opportunity to reach

hearings.

Now Ives and the other stu-
dents organizing next week’s
meeting have said they won’t
necessarily try to impeach Hoff-
man. And I think it’s a good sign
that Hoffman will appear at the
meeting. He told the Phi that
he will address the campaign
E-mails when he speaks to the
group.

But if undergraduates are
unhappy with the new EC Presi-
dent, they have only themselves
to blame. Only 40 percent of
students voted in the initial elec-
tion, when Hoffman led the ﬁve
candidates with about 272 votes.

Turnout in the runoff between
Hoffman and undergraduate
junior John Twomey was even
more pathetic, with 719 students

ure to communicate (on the part of

— about 33 percent of the total
student body — showing up to
vote.

And those numbers are re-
ally deceiving. Only 24 percent
of undergraduates voted in the
runoff, while turnout among law
students was 74 percent.

How on earth can the under-
graduates explain a turnout gap
of 50 percentage points?

Ives argues that the voting
stations were poorly located on
the Hill, closed early and weren’t
open long enough.

I’m not buying those claims.
Selwyn Turner and Kathleen
Morphis have been running EC
elections for the past three years.
We’ve never had problems in the
past, and I’ve seen no evidence
that this year’s election was con-

ducted in a different fashion past
runoffs.

Ives said he believes far more
than 24 percent of undergradu-
ates wanted to vote on Election
Day. I think he may be engaging
in wishful thinking.

Apathy has clouded our EC
elections for each of my four
years at W&L. Turnout has
rarely been above 50 percent,
especially on the undergraduate
side of campus. In fact, some of
the highest turnout rates usually
come in the freshman EC elec-
tions each fall.

So why do students stop vot-
ing? Why do undergraduates not
care about who will be settling
honor cases and handing out
hundreds of thousands of dollars
in school money twice a year?

When this student body
meeting ﬁnally does occur,
maybe Ives shouldn’t focus on
Hoffman’s E-mails. The new
president’s attitude was rude and
condescending — that’s true. It
appears that many law students
look down on those of us across
the creek as intellectual inferiors
who aren’t as mature or thought-
ful as them — that’s also true.

But rude E-mails — while
disappointing ~ are not nearly
as problematic as terrible voter
apathy. We have an undergradu-
ate student body that apparently
doesn’t care who its leaders are
or how they operate.

Maybe we should ﬁx that
problem before we worry about
impeaching the EC president.

things are happening on this cam-
pus. Indeed, during the most dreaded
part of the worst academic term, 109
of your classmates signed a petition
calling for a Student Body Meeting.

As the name would suggest, the
entire student body is invited to con-
vene in one location and is invested
with certain powers. Speciﬁcally,
upon reaching a quorum of one half
of the total enrollment of Washington
and Lee University (slightly more
than one thousand students) we have
the ﬁill power to rescind non—honor
related decisions of the EC or to re-
move “unsatisfactory” oflicers elect-
ed to the EC. Why would so many
of your fellow students petition for a
meeting equipped with such serious
powers?

You likely know of the ﬁrst reason
because it has been reported exten-
sively here in the Phi. We believe,
and we understand that EC President
Eric Hoffman also agrees, that an as-
semblage of the student body is an
excellent venue for him to explain the
e-mail that was posted in this paper
before Spring Break.

Moreover, and this has not been
reported previously, the actual elec-
toral returns from the EC Presidential
Election were similarly problematic.

Examining the turnout in the elec-
tion it has become apparent that while
only about 24% of undergrads voted
in the election approximately 74% of
law students voted. This led to a his-
torically low (even for W&L) turnout
of around a third. Ultimately, the sum
of all these numbers means that only
6% of the undergraduate student body
voted for current EC President Hoff-
man. The meeting will also present an
excellent venue to ascertain whether
a mere quarter of the undergraduate
student body really sought to vote
or whether electoral regulations will
have to be redeveloped to give each

the polls.

Unfortunately, and similarly in-
conceivable, are the policies, proce-
dures, and general student climate on
the topic of sexual assault. According
to oﬁicial statistics published by the
school and mandated by Federal law
there has been one forcible sexual of-
fense (includes anything from rape
to unwanted sexual touching) on this
campus in the last four years. Dean
Dotson conﬁrms that in the past four
years there has been no sexual assault
case heard by the SF HB.

Given the problem that we know
exists on campus, these numbers are
simply impossible. Whether it be
formally deﬁning sexual assault as an
honor violation or taking some other
action the meeting will enable the
student body to ﬁrmly decide that this
issue will be neither skirted nor swept
under the rug any longer.

Further and perhaps more incon-
ceivably, this school remains com-

the EC AND the student body) and
in so doing begin to solve the previ-
ously addressed problems. The true
aim of the meeting is to re-establish
a dialogue about what it means to be
honorable and what it means to truly
be part of a campus in which student
self-govemance is of critical impor-
tance. If no ofﬁcers are removed and
no decisions are revoked the meeting
will not end in failure. In fact, that
would be the desirable outcome.

However, nothing about this de-
sire for cordiality and discourse in
any way reduces the need for ac-
countability. The framers of our Stu-
dent Body Constitution realized that
sometimes accountability can only
be accomplished through the powers
vested in the Student Body Meeting
no matter how regrettable it might be
to utilize those powers.

This underlies what a true failure
of the meeting might entail. If we
the Student Body fail to convene in

pletely in the dark as to the number of
honor investigations undertaken since
February ﬁrst of this year. Though
this is through no fault of current EC
Secretary Bill Larson, who thus far
is producing excellent and detailed
minutes of EC meetings, the current
environment on campus between the
students and their representatives
might hardly be seen to be one of mu-
tual trust and respect.

Truly the problem of transparency
runs deeper than even the previous
EC. It stems from a generalized lack
of communication between the stu-
dent body and our leaders. Despite
the best efforts of many, I still believe
the vast majority of students to be un-
aware that all scheduled EC meetings
are open to the public so long as the
EC does not adjoum into Executive
Session.

Ultimately the Student Body
Meeting is about remedying this fail-

suﬁicient numbers we prove the nay-
sayers right. We miss an opportunity
for redressing past problems and pre-
venting new ones from occurring.
We even defeat the very possibility of
accountability by failing to arrive in
the numbers necessary for a quorum.
On the other hand, success will not
result in the end of sexual assault on
campus or an instantaneous creation
of a responsible EC or student body.

‘ GAB Comedy: a hoot and a half

Top comedians bring their “ha ha is ” from the big leagues to the Colonnade

.)

 

By Katle Hatﬂeld
smrr WRITER

“My mouth tastes like Tris-
cuits, weed and loneliness,” Jas-
per Redd began.

If it sounds edgy, it was.

Known for pushing the enve-
lope in terms of political incor-
rectness, Redd was the most re-
cent performer that the General
Activities Board brought for its
comedy division last Wednes-
day.

A native of Knoxville, Tenn.,
Redd has performed on Comedy
Central, “Last Call with Car-
son Daly,” “Def Comedy Jam,”
and “Late Night with Conan
O’Brien.”

GAB was formed to attract a
wide range of entertainment for
the Washington and Lee commu-
nity by booking concerts, come-
dians and other activities.

GAB Comedy, the brainchild
of senior Morgan Harris, has
only grown in popularity since it
began three years ago.

Part of the program’s suc-
cess can be attributed to its
sizable budget used to attract
well-known or soon-to-be-well-
known talent.

“Sophomore year I was grant-
ed $5,000, and due to the success
of events, I now have $20,000 at
my disposal for a year of quality
comedic entertainment,” Harris
said.

And quality was what the
W&L audience received.

“Jasper was ridiculous!” ﬁrst-
year Ryan Henner said. “You
have to be good to have a whole
show about racism and not make
it uncomfortable, but he pulled it
off.”

Redd discussed with abandon

the not so gracious origins of the
Whopper Jr., the absurdity of the
McDonald’s mascot, Grimace
and receiving pajamas as a 30th
birthday gift.

He even poked fun at W&L’s

mor from things he determines
as forms of “subtle racism.” But
despite the taboo subject matter,
Redd had Stackhouse Theater
cracking up at the prospect that
“white chocolate” was revenge

“You have to be good to have a whole show

about racism and not make it uncomfortable,

but he pulled it off ”

Ryan Henner, ﬂrst-year

beloved mascot, the General.
“The Generals? More like the
Masters,” Redd said, referring
to the fact that both Washington
and Lee owned slaves.
Redd derives much of his hu-

for “chocolate milk.”

W&L senior Matt Harkins
warmed up the crowd for Redd
with some jokes of his own. He
earned many laughs through his
frank discussions of P.E. require-

ments, the people of Lexington
and the W&L population.

Harkins was a pleasure to
listen to because he is a member
of his own target audience, and
therefore everyone could relate
to just about anything he dis-
cussed.

Whether it was having a rough
night and not knowing what kind
of hangover he was dealing with,
meeting “interesting” towns-
people while running errands
or the potential illiteracy of the
student body, Harkins poked fun
at aspects of W&L life that most
people found amusing.

First-year Kelli J arrell, a ﬁrst-
time attendee of a GAB Comedy
event, became a fan of Harkins
almost immediately.

“I really enjoyed it. It was
funny to hear a lot of the ri-
diculous things about Lex and

W&L,” she said.

Despite the laughs and GAB
Comedy’s success, don’t expect
Lexington to host the likes of
Dane Cook anytime soon.

When asked whether or not
GAB Comedy would ever try to
elicit such a top-billed performer,
Harris said he doesn’t think so.

“The comics we bring in
for $3,000 often put on a better
show,” he said.

But GAB does plan on bring-
ing Arj Barker this term.

Barker, one of the “best in
the business,” according to Har-
ris, plays “Dave” on the popular
HBO series “Flight of the Con-
chords.”

GAB Comedy’s future should
be a treat for comedy connois-
seurs and ﬂedgling fans alike.

Hillel honors, remembers Holocaust victims

Annual Holocaust Remembrance Week plans speakers and events to raise awareness for genocide and injustice

By Llzz Dye
STA FF WRITER

Tonight Hillel will present
Holocaust survivor George
Salton as the keynote speaker for
Holocaust Remembrance Week.

The week-long event strives
both to remember the horrifying
murder of six million Jews and
to raise awareness to prevent
future acts of genocide.

Salton lived through 10
different concentration camps
throughout Germany, France and

Poland before he was liberated
by American forces when he
was 17. He was the only one in
his family to survive. Having
only a ﬁfth grade education and
speaking very little English,
Salton emigrated to America
and earned a master’s degree in
engineering.

Salton has been featured
on CNN’s “NewsNight” and
National Public Radio to speak

about his experiences. His
memoir, “The 23rd Pslam,” was
published in 2002.

“If there is one thing you do
all week, please come see Mr.
Salton speak. There is nothing
more eye-opening than hearing
a Holocaust survivor speak,”
sophomore Brian Cherry, a
member of Hillel and one of
the coordinators of Holocaust
Remembrance Week, said.

The lecture will begin at 5
p.m in the Stackhouse Theater.

The week rounds out on
Friday with the Yom Hashoah
service in Elrod Commons Room
345 led by Dean Hank Dobin.

The service includes prayers for
Holocaust survivors and is a way
to honor and remember their
deaths.

The week kicked off on
Monday with the ﬁlm “Deﬁance”
in the Stackhouse Theater. -The
ﬁlm is based on the true story of
a group of 1,200 Jews in Belarus
who successfully hid in the forest
from the Nazis.

Tuesday night included a
vigil to remember the lives lost
during the Holocaust. During the
vigil, students, faculty and staff

took turns reading the names of
victims.

Cherry said that by saying the
names of the victims, especially
children, it made the Holocaust
“more real” in peoples’ minds.

Sophomore Tracy Richardson
organized and planned the events
for the week. She gave the
opening comments at the vigil.

“Let us promise ourselves
and our martyrs that we shall
never forget the horrible tragedy
of the Holocaust; that we may
remain forever vigilant against

those who pursue genocide,
oppression, and hate,” she said.

On Wednesday night, the
AcademyAward-winningﬁlmfor
Best Picture, “Schindler’s List,”
was shown in the Stackhouse
Theater. The ﬁlm chronicles the
life of Oskar Schindler, a German
businessman who saved dozens
of Polish Jews by employing
them in his factories.

Both tennis teams compete at ODACs '

Women win title for 19th straight year, men lose in championship for ﬁrst time in 13 seasons

By Brooke Sutherland
STA FF W RITE R

Schools from all over the region
traveled to Lexington last weekend to
compete in the men’s and women’s tennis
ODAC tournament. The Washington
and Lee women took first place while the
men lost in the championship game.

The women’s team made a clean
sweep of its conference opponents,
dropping only three games total in
their three matches. The Generals
defeated Hollins 5-0 in the quarterﬁnals,
Randolph-Macon 6-0 in the semiﬁnals
and Virginia Wesleyan 5-0 in the ﬁnals
for their 19th consecutive ODAC
championship and an automatic bid to
the NCAA tournament.

“This weekend, we really had a solid
team effort,” said head coach Eric Ishida.
“It’s easy for us to take the ODAC
teams for granted since we have been
so successful against them, but I think
our girls knew that we had to show up
with the best team and play like the best
team.”

Facing off against eighth-seeded
Hollins, the Generals quickly set the
tone for their tournament performance.
Senior Katie Tabb and junior Lauren
Caire defeated Katie Dotson and Maggie
Bai 8-1 in the number-one doubles
spot. First-years Ann Morris and Trelsie
Sadler also added a victory (8-0) over
Shawnte Woodson and Lydia Coyne in
the number-two doubles spot. F irst-year
Lauren Lukas and senior Meg Spalitta
rounded out the doubles with an 8-2
win over Peyton Brogan and Caitlyn
Cooper.

In singles, the
equally unstoppable.

In the conference
finals.

Track competes at ODACs

Men ’s team places third, Lady Generals take second

victory on the ﬁfth line, and Morris
stunned Cooper at 6-0, 6-0 in number-
six singles.

“We all went into each match with
something to work on to keep us
focused,” Morris said. “Whether it was
working on being aggressive at the net or
poaching or for singles, just focusing on
coming into the court more often. I think
that really helped us.”

The Generals next faced off against
ﬁfth-seeded Randolph Macon in the
semiﬁnals. W&L simply demolished the
Yellow Jackets, winning every match in
straight sets. Tabb and Caire defeated
Windsor Tyler and Martha Vlahakis 8-0
in number-one doubles, followed by an
8-0 victory by Morris and Sadler over
Leslie Hainley and Margaret Giffen for
number-two doubles. Lukas and Spalitta
also walked away with an 8-0 victory
over Jade Thompson and Blair Kersh for
number-three doubles.

In singles, it was the same story of
W&L domination. Tabb defeated Taylor
6-0, 6-0 on the ﬁrst line, and Brzeski
added to her win from the previous
day with a 6-0, 6-0 win over Giffen in
number-three singles. First-year Jen
Snyder also contributed a 6-0, 6-0 win
over Hainley for number-two singles.

With two strong victories behind
them, W&L headed to the ﬁnals to
face off with second-seeded Virginia
Wesleyan. The Generals had already
defeated the Marlins 9-0 early on in the
season, and this match-up would prove
to be no different. Virginia Wesleyan was
held without a win and without a game
as the Generals charged forward with
a 5-0 win. In singles, Snyder defeated
Meredith Willett 6-0, 6-0 in the number-

three singles s ot while Brzeski capped

off her strong tournament showing with
a 6-0, 6-0 victory over Shannon Shabo
at number-four singles. Spalitta defeated
Morgan Franklin 6-0, 6-0 for number-
ﬁve singles and Morris won at number-
six singles by default when Virginia
Wesleyan failed to provide a player. The
nurnber—three doubles match was also
decided by default.

Finishing with a 19-4 record, the
Generals also took home several
individual honors. For the second year in
a row, Ishida was named ODAC Coach
of the Year and Tabb was tapped as
ODAC Player of the Year.

“Katie has just been a terriﬁc leader
both this year and last year,” Ishida
said. “She played. well all season. Of
course she had a couple losses, but she
responded well and turned things around
quickly. She is a great person to have in
the number-one spot. All the younger
girls look up to her for how she ﬁghts
through matches.”

Additionally, ﬁrst-year Ellen Yeatrnan
was named ODAC Rookie of the Year
for her efforts this season. Yeatrnan
compiled an impressive ll-2 doubles
and 9-4 singles record during her ﬁrst
spring season.

“It’s a great honor, especially since my
coach took the effort to nominate me,”
Yeatrnan said. “I feel like I’ve improved
a lot. The team has really pushed me, and
I’ve learned a lot from them.”

“We knew Ellen was a very talented
player as a [high school] junior,” Ishida
added. “We’re excited to have her come
in and develop under our program. She
hasn’t been 100 percent this season
because of injuries, but she continues
to win matches and compete at a high
level.”

With the ODAC trophy ﬁrmly in hand,
the Generals are now turning their sights
to the upcoming NCAA championships.

“Really what ODACs are all about
is getting that automatic bid to the
NCAAS,” Ishida said. “That’s what
we’re playing for.”

The team will ﬁnd out its ﬁrst
opponent and location May 2 and begin
NCAA play May 8. W&L will face a
much harder regional than it has seen in
recent years with four top 10 teams vying
for a spot in the next round. But after the
Generals’ stunning performance in the
ODAC championships this weekend,

Ishida has every right to be optimistic

about his team’s chances.

“Our regional is a lot tougher this year
and I don’t want to look too far ahead,”
he said. “But I think we’re one of the
best teams in the country. If everyone
plays well at the same time on the same
day, I think we’ve got a great shot to do
really well.”

On the men’s side, the nationally 25th
ranked W&L team defeated Guilford
9-0 in the quarterﬁnals and Roanoke
College 8-1 in the semiﬁnals, but fell
to Hampden-Sydney 5-3 in the ﬁnals,
breaking a string of 13 consecutive titles
and marking the Generals’ ﬁrst loss to an
ODAC opponent since 2000.

The top-seeded Generals started out
strong against eighth-seeded Guilford
on Friday, sweeping both the doubles
and singles. At number-one doubles,
sophomores Will Hall and Tim Watson
took a 9-7 victory over Will Mason-
Deese and Alec Chase. Junior Alex
Brooke and senior McCardell followed
with an 8-6 win over Ben Lewis and
Patrick Childs at number-two doubles
and ﬁrst-years Jonathan Gaﬂhey and
Mac Davis captured an easy 8-1 win
over Garrett Tanner and Billy Dennis in
number-three doubles

In singles, McCardell dominated
Mason-Deese 6-1, 6-3 on the ﬁrst line.
First-year Ben Fass echoed his victory
with a 6-1, 6-3 win of his own over
Chase in number-two singles. Watson
contributed a 6-1, 6-0 win over Childs at
number-three singles while Brooke took
a 6-1, 6-2 victory over Lewis at number-
four singles. Hall knocked oﬁ" Dennis 6-
0, 6-0 at number-ﬁve singles, and Davis
completed the Generals’ sweep with a 6-
0, 6-0 win over Tanner at number six.

A semiﬁnal match-up against the
fourth-seeded Roanoke Maroons posed
a greater challenge for Washington and
Lee, but the Generals held up under the
pressure and delivered another solid
victory. Hall and Watson defeated Jon
Roy and Sam Sherill 8-4 in number-one
doubles while Brooke and McCardell
defeated DeWitt and Sam Jordan 8-1 in
the number-two spot. Gaffney and ﬁrst-
year Jeremy Becht took the number-three

doubles match at 8-2 over Alex Lyons
and Drew Rogers.

Although McCardell fell to Roy 4-6,
6-4, 12-10 in number-one singles, the
other Generals held on to sweep the rest
of the singles matches. Becht defeated
Sherrill 7-5, 6-0 in the number-two spot,
and junior Brent Meyers contributed a 7-
5, 6-3 win over Rogers for number-three
singles. Fass won easily at number-four
singles, knocking off Jordan 6-0, 6-0,
and ﬁrst-year Michael Freeman earned a
6-0, 6-2 victory over DeWitt at number-
ﬁve singles. Watson closed out the match
with a 6-3, 6-4 rout of Lyons at number-
six singles.

Heading into the ﬁnals against
Hampden-Sydney, W&L seemed to be
in control and poised to take their 14th
straight ODAC title. The last time the
Generals played the Tigers, they coasted
to an easy 7-2 victory. But this time
around things would not be so easy

The Generals got off to a poor start,
dropping two of the three doubles
matches. Hall and Watson fell 8-3 to
William Moss and Rick Pugh in number-
one doubles and Brooke and McCardell
suffered a tough 8-6 loss to Shad Harrell
and Kevin Calhoun at number-two
doubles. Gaffney and Becht gave the
Generals their only win in doubles with
an 8-4 victory over Tal Covington and
Phillip Parrish in the number-three spot.

In singles, the Generals continued to
struggle. McCardell fell to Moss 7-5,
6-2 in number-one singles, and Meyers
struggled against Harrell in number-
three singles, losing 6-3, 6-3. The
Generals stepped up to deliver victories
in numbers-four, ﬁve and six singles
matches. Fass defeated Calhoun 6-4,
6-4 at number four, followed by a 6-2,
6-1 victory by Freeman over Zack Pack
at number ﬁve and a hard-fought 6-4,
1-6, 6-4 win by Watson over Parrish at
number six.

When asked what the difference was
between the championship and W&L’s
regular-season Hampden-Sydney match,
Becht said, “I don’t know, we just didn’t
come out ﬁred up, and they wanted it
more.”

For the ﬁrst time in the last 13 years,
the Generals will not receive the ODAC
automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.
So now the men’s team must play the
waiting game to ﬁnd out whether it will
receive an at-large bid to compete in the
NCAA tournament.

Becht, who was named co-ODAC
men’s tennis Rookie of the Year, thinks
that his team has a “very slim” chance
to make the NCAAs, and summed up
his ﬁrst year, “It was a tough season.
 It was a rebuilding year, and I think
we really showed that we have a lot of
young talent and that we will be really
dangerous in the next few years.”

During the last weekend of
Spring Break, the Washington
and Lee men’s and women’s
track teams competed at the 2009
ODAC championship, held here
at Wilson Field. The women ﬁn-
ished second after earning 139
points while the men captured
third with 103 points. Together,
the teams gathered 26 All-ODAC
citations, six ODAC individual
champions, three school re-
cords and two NCAA—qualifying
marks.

“The whole meet was a real
nail-biter.  We kept on bopping
around from ﬁrst to fourth to sec-
ond, etc. Every event mattered,”
said senior Becca Taylor.

The women were led by se-
nior Elizabeth Webb, who was
also named the Co-Athlete of
the Meet and the ODAC/Farrn
Bureau Scholar-Athlete of the
Year. Webb ﬁnished ﬁrst in three
different events: the 1500 with a
time of 4:46.77, the 800 with a
time of2:2l .17 and then the 5000
with a time of 18:58.30.

Senior Stacy Doombos’s time
of 14.89 in the 100 meter hurdles
helped her to ﬁnish second, set a
school record, and qualify for the
NCAA in that event. Doombos
earned a second qualifying mark
in the long jump after a third
place ﬁnish with a leap of 5.48
meters. Then in the high jump,
Doombos ﬁnished third with a
jump of 1.53 meters.

“It was great that W&L hosted
this year’s ODAC meet because
it was an awesome way to cap off
my W&L track experience,” com-
mented Doornbos. “I was really
happy with how the meet went.
I was able to have some personal
best performances which were
really exciting and helped make
the meet a memorable one.”

Taylor captured the gold in the
3000-meter steeplechase, setting
both school and ODAC records
with a time of 11:22.19. She then
took second in the 5000 meters
with a time of 19:26.20.

“Every time I run the steeple-
chase, I love it even more,” com-
mented Taylor. “The support of
teammates, both on the sides and

in the race with me, made all the
difference. And now, my new
time has really motivated me to
keep on trying for that qualifying
mark.”

Top ﬁnishes in the steeple-
chase also included senior Jess
Shaw who ﬁnished second with
a time of 11:34.64. In the high
jump, junior Maggie Sutherland
jumped 1.53 meters for a second-
place ﬁnish. Junior Sallie Arm-
strong ﬁnished third in the shot
put after a toss of 10.89 meters.
Senior Grace Andrews ﬁnished
third in the discus after a toss of
33.99 meters. In the 400-meter
hurdles, ﬁrst-year Natalie Stier
ran a time of 1:06.92 for a third-
place ﬁnish.

The men also had several
strong performances. Senior
Vance Berry ﬁnished second
in the 1500 meters in a time of
4:02.49. His classmate Chip Mc-
Coy also captured the silver in the
400 meters with a time of 57.49.
Junior Ben Goetsch also ﬁnished
second aﬁer leaping 1.93 meters
in the high jump.

Junior Thomas Brandlein cap-

tured third in the 400-meter race
after running a time of 57.89. Se-
nior Michael Welsh ﬁnished third
in both the 1500 meters and 5000
meters. His times were 4:02.54
and 15:58.00, respectively. Soph-
omore Jeff Giordano also earned
two third-place ﬁnishes with a
11.08 in the 100 meters, and a
22.29 in the 200 meters.

Junior Billy Billington was
named the men’s ODAC/Farm
Bureau Scholar-Athlete of the
Year. He also won the hammer
throw with a toss of 49.82 me-
ters for a school record. He also
captured the gold in the shot put
with a toss of 13.70 meters and
then took silver in the discus with
a throw of 42. 15 meters.

After the meet, Sutherland
concluded, “The senior girls led
the team to a great ODAC ﬁnish.”
She added, “They pulled the rest
of the team through, and we are
going to sorely miss them. The
class, as a whole, embodies awe-
some athleticism, talent and lead-
ership.”

Men’s lacrosse advances to ﬁnals

Generals beat Guilford 25-3 Saturday in quarters, Lynchburg I2-II Wednesday in semis

MORGAN HARRIS / Staff Photographer

By Megan Daily
STAFF WRITER

The nationally 1 0th—ranked
Washington and Lee men’s lacrosse
team advanced to the ODAC
championship game with a 12-11
win over second-seeded Lynchburg
Wednesday night. More information
on the game was not available as of
press time.

On Saturday, the third-seeded
Generals defeated Guilford 25-3 to
advance to the ODAC semiﬁnals. This
is second-highest scoring lacrosse
game in W&L history.

Since moving to Division III in
1987, W&L has won eight ODAC
championships and advanced to
the NCAA tournament eight times,
ﬁnishing as a semiﬁnalist in 1987,
2000 and 2002.

Even though they had easily
defeated Guilford this season, 18-2,
W&L came out with energy early in
the ODAC tournament.

W&L showed great offensive
tenacity, outshooting their opponent
71-14. Fifteen different Generals were
able to ﬁnd the net. The Generals got
a solid 9-2 lead going into the half and
never looked back. They scored 10
more goals in the third quarter and in
the last quarter put six more scores on
the board.

Senior attackman Harry St. John
commented on his ﬁnal ODAC
tournament, “Playing in the tournament
is more urgent than ever now that we
are seniors. If we don’t get a bid to
NCAAs, I would consider this season
a failure.”

Junior attackman Will Keigler had
four goals and three assists to lead
the offensive charge. Sophomore
midﬁelder Drew Koeneman also netted
four goals, and sophomore attackman
Spence Daw tallied two goals and two

assists. Senior midﬁelder Tim Skeen
contributed two goals and an assist
while junior midﬁelder Kevin Feeney
and ﬁrst-year midﬁelder Luke Walter
added two goals each.

To balance out the Generals’
attack, sophomore attackman Dan
Sullivan, senior attackman Seth
Fishman, sophomore midﬁelder Mark
Wachtmeister, sophomore attackman
Tom Hagner, sunior attackman Max
Mancuso, senior midﬁelder Seldon
Clarke, ﬁrst-year midﬁelder Mike Ott,
junior midﬁelder Chris Washington
and senior midﬁelder Kevin Fuge all
had one goal apiece.

F irst-year attackman Scott Meehan
had two assists. Sophomore midﬁelder
Justin Donati, sophomore attackman
Drew Mancini, ﬁrst-year defenseman
Alex Sturges, Sullivan and Washington
each had one assist.

The Generals also used four

different goalkeepers during the game.
Senior Connor Locke allowed 2 goals
and had two saves in his 39:13 minutes
of play. Junior Matt Mason was solid
between the pipes for his 6:12 minutes.

Sophomore Ned Lundvall had one
save, and sophomore Jason Lumpkin
allowed one but saved another. Overall
the goalkeepers combined for four
saves and only allowed three scores.

With the quarterﬁnal win Saturday
and the semiﬁnal win Wednesday,
W&L plays the winner of the
Hampden—Sydney and Roanoke game
in the ODAC championship Sunday at
1:00 p.m.

Looking ahead to the rest of the
playoffs, St. John remarked, “I would
love our senior class to be remembered
as the class that brought W&L lacrosse
back to the national stage.”

Women’s lacrosse falls in ODAC finals

Team does not win conference crown for ﬁrst time since 2002 after 9-1] loss to Roanoke

The Washington and Lee
women’s lacrosse team competed
in the ODAC tournament last
weekend. The Generals beat
third-seeded Randolph-Macon
14-3 in the semiﬁnals on Saturday
and fell to top-seeded Roanoke
9-11 in the ﬁnals on Sunday.

The second-seeded Generals
came into the weekend ranked
sixteenth in the nation with an
11-4 overall record and a 7-1
mark in the conference.

W&L’s ﬁrst test came against
the Randolph-Macon Yellow
Jackets. The Generals won the
previous contest between the two
by a score of 22-5. The Generals
continued the dominance in
the ﬁrst half of last weekend’s
contest. W&L played tough
defense, only allowing one
Yellow Jacket goal in the ﬁrst
30 minutes. In one stretch in the
ﬁrst half, the Generals scored
seven unanswered goals. The

half ended with an 8-1 W&L
advantage. Senior midﬁelder
Colleen Evans and sophomore
midﬁelder Emmy Mathews
tallied two goals apiece before
halftime.

The second half was not much
closer. W&L scored three of the
ﬁrst four goals, pushing the lead
to 11-2. Junior attacker Meredith
Freeman added two goals in this
stretch. When it was all over,
W&L had increased the ﬁnal
margin to 11 with a 14-3 victory.
This win secured the Generals a
spot in the ODAC ﬁnals for the
eighth consecutive year.

W&L’s impressive effort
was led by a balanced offensive
attack. Six Lady Generals scored
multiple goals. F irst-year attacker
Maddie McKaig led the way with
three goals. Emmy Mathews.
Evans, Freeman, sophomore
attacker Britten Mathews and
sophomore attacker Kate Speare
all scored twice for the Generals.
Senior midﬁelder Kelsi Robinson

added a goal and an assist while
senior attacker Katie Flippen
had two assists. Sophomore
Katharine Farrar played 42:38
in goal saving eight shots while

ODAC championships coming
into this season. The Generals
also had a six-gamle win streak
coming into the contest.

W&L started out strong.

“I think this past weekend was very chal-

lenging for the whole team. The combination

of expectations and good competition really

tested us. ”

Maddie McKaig, first-year attacker
 

allowing three goals. First-year
Jennifer Linder played 17:22 in
goal and allowed no goals.

This win moved W&L to the
ﬁnal game against the top-seeded
Roanoke Maroons. Roanoke
won the regular-season contest
12-8 on March 28. W&L had
won the previous six straight

Led by two goals from Kelsi
Robinson, the Generals got out
to a 5-0 lead. However, Roanoke
battled back by going on a 3-1
run to close the half. This left the
halftime score at 6-3.

Roanoke continued the
momentum into the second half,
scoring the ﬁrst three goals to

tie the contest at 6-6. The teams
then exchanged goals to knot
the score up at seven. The tie
was broken with 16:16 to play
by a goal from Emmy Mathews
assisted by Britten Mathews.

After this point, Roanoke
went on a run that would seal
the contest. The Maroons scored
four unanswered capped of by
a goal from senior attacker Ella
Wade with 6:27 left that gave
Roanoke a 11-8 lead. Meredith
Freeman would add a ﬁnal goal
for W&L, but it would not be
enough as Roanoke walked away
with an 11-9 win and the ODAC
championship.

However, W&L is still eligible
for an at-large bid to the NCAA
tournament, which is set to begin
May 6.

Robinson led the Generals
with three goals and an assist.
Freeman added two goals. Evans,
sophomore attacker Wilton
Megargel, Emmy Mathews
and ﬁrst-year attacker Maddie

McKaig also tallied goals for the
Generals. Sophomore attacker
Kate Donnelly and Britten
Mathews each chipped in an
assist. Sophomore Katharine
Farrar played 55:13 in goal and
made four saves.

“I think this past weekend
was very challenging for the
‘whole team. The combination
of expectations and good
competition really tested us.
Even though Sunday’s outcome
wasn’t what we wanted, we stay
together,” said McKaig.

The Generals return to action
on Saturday when they travel to
Christopher Newport for a 1:00
p.m. contest.

Despite the loss, W&L looks
forward to the rest of its season,
with hopes for an at-large bid to
the NCAA tournament. “I am
so ready to get back out there
on Saturday and show everyone
that we belong in the NCAA
tournament,” said McKaig.

Golf team wins ODAC championship again

Generals prepare for NCAA tournament for second straight year, look to improve on 16th-place 2008 ﬁnish

On April 20, the Washington
and Lee golf team came back
from six shots down in the ﬁnal
round to win the ODAC champi-
onships for the second consecu-
tive year. The three-day tourna-
ment was held at the Bay Creek
Golf Club in Cape Charles, Va.

The Generals started off the
tournament on April 18 in second
place with a team score of 329,
eleven strokes behind the leader
Guilford. In the second round,
W&L twiddled the Quakers’ lead
down to six, by shooting 311.

Junior Robert Womble, who
tied for fourth overall individual-

ly (82-77-78—237), commented
on the team’s conﬁdence heading
into the last round. “Going into
the ﬁnal day six back, we knew
we were right there. Six shots is
not hard to make up in team play,
especially on a course as difﬁcult
as Bay Creek.

“The courses were set up very
difﬁcult all three days, making
low scores extremely difﬁcult.
We knew that if we could just
pay ﬁve solid rounds, we would
have an excellent chance to win,”
said Womble.

Junior Brad Watts, who was
also in the three-way tie for
fourth place (82-75-80—~237),
focused on the start of his ﬁnal

round. “Being down six, we re-
ally wanted to get off to a good
start and put pressure on the rest
of the ﬁeld from the beginning.
[Senior] Andrew Green did a tre-
mendous job of this by posting
a great score (75) early that re-
ally set the tone for the rest of the
team,” he said.

In rainy and windy weather,
the Generals shot their best score
of the tournament, an aggregate
309, on the ﬁnal day to win the
championship by ﬁve strokes
over Guilford.

Speaking of the course condi-
tions, Womble said, “The team
concentrated on not trying to
force a good round, instead play-

ing steadily and patiently, letting
good opportunities come to you.
Avoiding a big number was espe-

“Going into the ﬁnal
day six back, we

cially important in playing Bay
Creek well.”

Watts echoed his teammate’s
comments, “Because of the

weather conditions, the course
played two or three shots harder
than normal, so it was very im-
portant to be patient out there,
especially on the ﬁnal day.”
Watts and Womble paced the
Generals, earning all-toumament
honors with fourth-place ﬁn-
ishes. Junior Joe Gibson tied for
seventh place (81-81-76~238),
Green tied for 18th (91-80-75—
246), and junior Matt Langan
ﬁlled out the W&L line-up in
23rd place (84-79-86-249).
While in Cape Charles,
Womble was named ﬁrst-team
All-ODAC. In addition, Gib-
son earned second—team honors
while Watts earned an honorable

mention for his season.

With the conference crown,
the Generals advance to the
NCAA tournament for the sec-
ond consecutive year. Last year,
the team placed 16th with an
individual third-place ﬁnish for
Nathaniel James, a current as-
sistant coach of the team. This
year’s tournament will take place
May 13-16 at the PGA Golf Club
in Port St. Lucie, Fla.

Looking ahead to nationals,
Watts said, “In any tournament,
your goal is to win, but with a
16th-place ﬁnish last year, we are
looking to improve on that and
hopefully ﬁnish in the top 10.”

W&L baseball wins its see0nd—ever conference title

By Will Dorrance
SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee baseball
team won its ﬁrst-ever ODAC champi-
onship Sunday with a 10-6 win over Vir-
ginia Wesleyan. It is only the second con-
ference championships in the 102-year
existence of the program. The Generals
won the College Athletic Conference
championships back in 1972.

W&L ﬁnished the 2009 regular season
with an 18-12 overall record and a 9-9
conference mark, earning them the sixth
and last seed in the four-day ODAC tour-
nament.

W&L’s post-season began last Thurs-
day at the Lynchburg City Stadium

contest proved to be much different than
W&L’s game the day before as both teams
combined for 24 runs, but the Generals
fell short in the slugfest, 10-14.

First-year righthander Roger Strong
was credited with the loss as he gave up
seven runs in just four innings of work.
Senior lefthander Casey Hartman surren-
dered nine runs in 8.1 innings and earned
the win for the Eagles.

To remain in the double-elimination
tournament, the Generals had to beat
third-seeded Randolph-Macon, the 2008
ODAC champions, on Saturday. The
game was tied in the top of the ninth in-
ning when senior second baseman Byron
Pester hit a two-run home run to left cen-

“It was the best feeling in the world after that last out.
The pile-up in the middle of the ﬁeld was like a dream

—- unlike anything else I ’ve ever experienced in sports. ”

Jim Plantholt unior third baseman

against top-seeded Lynchburg. Head
coach Jeff Stickley spoke of his reaction
to the Generals’ ﬁrst-round match-up.
“We knew they were a good team, but we
were conﬁdent going into it, and we split
with them in the regular season, so we
knew we could beat them. I didn’t think
they were playing that great the last week
or two of the season, and I knew we were
playing pretty good, so I thought it was a
pretty good-match-up.”

In Thursday’s game, junior righthand-
er Chuck Davidson battled it out with
Lynchburg’s junior righthander Bryan
Breedlove in a pitching duel. The Hor-
nets got on the board ﬁrst with a run on a
passed ball in the fourth, but the Generals
bounced back scoring two runs in the sev-
enth and ninth innings for the 4-1 upset.

Davidson threw seven frames of one-
run baseball to earn the win while Breed-
love lost the game giving up two runs in
6.2 innings. Closer Brendan Clark re-
corded a two—inning save for the Gener-
als.

Of the win, Davidson said, “It is very
important to win the ﬁrst game. It is even
more important to win the ﬁrst game over
the number one-seeded team. We were
all conﬁdent that we could win the whole
thing, and the win was just one step closer
to our preseason goal.”

On Friday, W&L faced off with fourth-
seeded Bridgewater, who had beaten
Randolph-Macon on Thursday. Friday’s

ter to give the Generals the eventual 8-6
victory.

Clark earned the win in 4.2 innings
of two-hit, scoreless relief. Sophomore
pitcher Brian Jordan lost the game for the
Yellow Jackets alter giving up the two-
run homer to Pester.

Just ﬁve hours after W&L’s win over
Randolph-Macon, the team had to play
the second game of its doubleheader—
this one against ﬁfth-seeded Ha1npden-
Sydney, who was 2-0 in the tournament
at the time. The Tigers would not stay
undefeated for much longer as the Gener-
als handed them the 6-1 loss.

Davidson started again on Saturday on
two days’ rest and went eight innings, giv-
ing up just one unearned run. Sophomore
righthander Mike Blanchard received the
loss for Hampden-Sydney, giving up ﬁve
runs in 5.1 innings.

With the win, the Generals advanced
to the ODAC championship Sunday for
the third time in seven seasons, still look-
ing for its ﬁrst conference crown since
1972. They played Virginia Wesleyan,
who had beaten Hampden-Sydney earlier
in the day in an elimination game.

The Marlins swept W&L in the
schools’ regular-season double-header
on March 7. Senior righthander Andrew
Henderson got the starting ball for the
Generals; sophomore righthander Gary
Bulman, who earned the win in one of the

' games over W&L on March 7, started for

Virginia Wesleyan.

It did not take long, however, for the
Generals’ offense to get to Bulman on
Sunday. He was pulled from the game
after surrendering four runs in the ﬁrst in-
ning while only recording one out on a
sacriﬁce bunt.

Junior third baseman Jim Plantholt
spoke of Bulman’s struggles. “We knew
[Virginia Wesleyan] was down on pitch-
ing, and we were pretty sure Bulman was
going to get the start. He’s usually pretty
good but sometimes a little wild.

“He was going on short rest, so our
game plan was to be very patient and wait
for a good strike to hit — not being over-
aggressive and anxious, and it paid off.
He had trouble throwing his curveball
for a strike, and we jumped on his fast-
ball, which was up in the zone,” Plantholt
said.

The pitching change did not slow
down W&L’s hitters as the team scored
ten runs overall in the ﬁrst four innings,
all before Virginia Wesleyan could get on
the scoreboard. The Marlins did begin to
claw their way back into the contest, but
time ran out as the Generals won 10-6.

Plantholt recalled the moment the last
Marlins’ batter grounded out to junior
shortstop John Ditore to win the Gener-
als’ ﬁrst ODAC championship. “It was
the best feeling in the world after that last
out. The pile-up in the middle of the ﬁeld
was like a dream — unlike anything else
l’ve ever experienced in sports,” he said.

With the conference trophy, W&L ad-
vances to the NCAA tournament, which
begins at the regional level on May 13.

Speaking of his team’s plans for the
days after the ODAC championship,
Stickley said, “Well, number one, we are
enjoying the championship for a couple
of days. Number two, then, I’ll try to get
them back down to Earth and get them
back in the mindset of getting ready for
another tournament.”

Davidson, Peyster, Plantholt, senior
centerﬁelder Terrence McKelvey and
sophomore rightﬁelder Anthony Cardona
were all honored as members of the all-
tournament team; in addition, Davidson
was awarded the Most Outstanding Play-
er with a 0.00 post-season ERA in 15 in-
nings on the mound.

Stickley thought that his team’s conﬁ-
dence throughout the tournament helped
them win the championship. “We were
not shocked by winning it. We kind of
knew we could, and I think once we won
a game or two, the guys kind of expected
it. And it was a lot of fun,” he chuckled.
