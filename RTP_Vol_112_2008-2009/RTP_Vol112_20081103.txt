W&L professors from four departments discuss effects of an Obama presidency

For many Americans, what
happens on Tuesday will mark
the end of countless months of
voracious debate, media cover-
age and Saturday Night Live par-
ody. It is safe to assume that by
the end of the night - or at least
into the wee hours of Wednesday
morning — Americans will know
the identity of their next presi-
dent.

While Tuesday’s presidential
election results will likely signal
the end of the campaigns, several
Washington and Lee professors
involved with the African-Amer-
ican Studies Program suggest the
conversation about this election
will not end with the punch of
the ballot.

‘‘I think everybody’s kind of
got their ears perked up more
so than usual,” said Prof. Lucas
Morel of the Politics department.
Morel was one of three profes-
sors featured in last Monday’s
panel, “The Obama Candidacy:
What Does it Mean for (Black)
America?” which took place in
Commons 345.

Morel explained that the fo-
rum was not held to provide any
sort of last-minute publicity for
Barack Obama’s campaign, but
to allow students and faculty to
engage in a critical discussion of
his position as an African-Amer-
ican from a variety of different
perspectives.

In his presentation, Morel
analyzed Obama’s candidacy
from a political perspective and

the opportunity it provides for
Americans to reﬂect on what it
means to be a citizen. Morel,
who teaches courses on Black
American politics and the politi-

American culture, he is not bound
to it and might best be viewed as
an American candidate, not sim-
ply an African-American one.
Morel phoned in his inter-

“We ’re all thz'c/«skinned enough to give

and take in this way and still remain friends

Lucas Morel, politics professor .
 

cal philosophy of Abraham Lin-
coln, encouraged listeners and
potential voters to focus on the
message, rather than the color of
the messenger.

He asserted that while Barack
Obama is rooted in African-

view from Princeton University
in New Jersey, where he is cur-
rently doing research for an up-
coming book on Abraham Lin-
coln.

“I would have liked to
have been there,” Morel said.

“Through the wonders of tech-
nology, of course, I came via
speakerphone.”

Morel’s political perspective
was complemented by two other
presentations from professors of
history and English. Prof. Dayo
Abah, who mediated the panel,
offered the occasional insight
from her position as a professor
of journalism and mass commu-
nications.

Morel described this multi-
faceted approach as the hallmark

. of the African-American Studies

Program. The program, which
began at W&L in 2005, is like
many of the University’s non-
major concentrations in its inter-
disciplinary approach to a topic
of study.

“We really didn’t just pay lip

service to the interdisciplinary
portion of the program,” Prof.
Morel said in response to the
discussion.

Prof. Marc Conner, current
chair of the African-American
Studies program and professor of
English, offered a variety of per-
spectives in his own discourse.
Conner’s portion of the discus-
sion focused on the paradoxical
nature of Obama’s candidacy —
how race means both everything

' and nothing in his campaign.

His presentation assessed the
power of the candidate’s rhetoric
and composure in translating the
founding documents of our na-
tion in a living and vital way.

Drinking deb ate

Dean Watkins attends Amethyst Initiative panel

By Katherlne Roberts
STAFF WRITER

As part of the national conversation
concerning the drinking age, W&L Dean
Dawn iWatkins participated in a panel
called “Responsible Drinking Redeﬁned”
at Ball State University last month.

The panel, which was hosted by one
of Indiana University’s debate classes,
was a response to the Amethyst Initiative,
a movement of college presidents to call
national attention to the drinking age. The
initiative states that its mission is to sup-
port “informed and unimpeded debate on
the 21 year-old drinking age.”

While the general sentiment among the
343 people in the auditorium was for re-
ducing the drinking age, Watkins said the
questions were well balanced.

In the middle of this discussion, Wat-

Election

polling place was. It was more of go-
ing through everything they need to know
to vote. It’s really coming down to the last
few phone calls, last few visits to people’s
houses. By offering rides, we are trying to
get people out to vote and really give them
no choice not to vote,” he said.

On the opposite side of the political
spectrum, the College Republicans have
pursued a similar line of action to raise
voter awareness, such as going to rallies
and canvassing, said College Republicans
president Scott Centorino.

“Two weekends ago, a group of us
went all through downtown Lexington. We
spoke to folks and passed out literature not
only to increase voter awareness but also
to get W&L students involved with the
election,” Centorino said. “[Saturday] we
went phone banking again, where we also
met up with Congressman Bob Goodlatte.
Afterwards, we split up and went door-to-
door, talking to potential voters in efforts
to mobilize the populace.”

Instead of travelling away from Lex-
ington and campaigning in neighboring
states like Kentucky, the College Repub-
licans opted to stay on campus and further
their efforts locally.

“There really is no need to leave Vir-
ginia. It is a swing state, and we need to
get a higher voter turnout,” Centorino said.
“Now the strategy in general is not trying
to convince undecided voters. What we
want to do is turn out core supporters and
mobilize them. That’s the name of the
game: get out the people you need to get
out to the polling places and make sure
they cast their ballots.”

“What’s great about going to school
here is that we’re on a college campus
that’s not oriented with one particular
state,” Centorino said. “You interact with
students from all over the country, and
from other swing states like Ohio, Penn-
sylvania, and Florida. You come in contact
with so many other outside views, regional
views from all across the nation. You can’t
do that on other campuses.”

“I actually registered to vote here in Vir-
ginia,” Wilson said. “South Carolina has
pretty much been a republican stronghold
for quite a while now. It’s deﬁnitely more

York Times Political Commentator
David Brooks right alongside 20th-centu-
ry author and political scholar Ralph El-
lison, in discussing the power of Obama’s
language. -

Prof. Theodore DeLaney moved be-
yond words and focused on the symbol-
ism of Obama’s candidacy for the Afri-
can-American community. Yet, DeLaney
asserted that an Obama presidency will
not signal the end of racism in the United
States.

“I certainly hope that it’s going to be a
greater thing than race,” DeLaney said.

He said that the symbolic importance
of the campaign is that it demonstrates
possibility for theAfrican-American com-
munity, but not necessarily a clear sign of
racial harmony in the United States.

“He also came at it from the perspec-
tive of a black man who’s been around
the block longer than anyone on the pan-
el,” Morel said of DeLaney.

DeLaney was instrumental in the de-
velopment of the African-American Stud-
ies Program three years ago. The panel
discussion was co-sponsored by the pro-
gram and the Ofﬁce of Student Affairs.

“What I talked about was, ‘Well, this is
what I see,’” she said. “And what I see is
higher-risk drinking among ﬁrst-years.”

Alcohol is a kind of forbidden fruit for
those under 21, Watkins said, and students
tend to drink less heavily once they are le-
gal. Watkins also appeared a guest on a
local radio show to share her comments.

is, just to change votes and increase voter
awareness. In South Carolina, it’s nearly
impossible to convince voters to vote lib-
eral since it’s such a red state.”

While political frenzy has taken over
much of the student population, the race
has not ended yet and anything can hap-
pen. Connelly offered his insight as to
who might become the nation’s next chief
executive.

“It looks like it’s Barack Obama’s race
to lose — meaning, it’s his race to win,”
Connelly said. “It’s been his race to lose
for some time now because of a few key
fundamentals like an unpopular president,
unpopular war and a sour economy: Bush
is an advantage, the Iraq war is an advan-
tage, and the ﬁnancial crisis is deﬁnitely
an advantage. Not to mention, the demo-
crats have the natural advantage. Histori-
cally, Americans tend not to elect the same
party two times in a row.”

Centorino, much like other Republi-
cans, have not seen this as a setback.

“Of course the outcome is difﬁcult to
predict. The polls say Obama, but it’s not
over until it’s over,” Centorino said. “If
we didn’t think there were as a chance for
McCain, we wouldn’t be out there can-
vassing, phone banking and going door
to door. No poll is going to stop us from
believing. “

Virginia Congressman Bob Goodlatte
also commented on the likely outcome of
the election, citing that the decision ulti-
mately lies in the hands of the voters and
not on the predictions of the polls.

“I think John McCain’s chances are
still very good. The momentum is still
building, and the election is only a couple
days away,” Goodlatte said. “The momen-
tum will still keep growing, especially
thanks to all the volunteers we’ve had
— including W&L students who made over
1,000 phone calls [on Friday]. It’s going to
become a real contest between these two
politicians.”

Left-wing and right-wing beliefs aside,
both the College Democrats and College
Republicans want all eligible voters to
make their voices heard.

“We’ve got to have faith that voters
will take it upon themselves to learn about
each candidate, and then vote accordingly
to what they think is right. It’s just a matter
of getting out there and voting,” Centorino
said.

questions, Morel said he felt right at
home in the discussion. Even when they
disagreed, the professors did not let the
conversation stray into a debate about
policy issues or which candidate would
be the best leader.

“We’re all thick-skinned enough to
give and take in this way and still remain
friends afterwards,” Morel said. In this
way, Morel felt the discussion progressed
in exactly the way he and his colleagues
had anticipated.

Despite the distance, Morel said he
could feel the vitality of the conversation
from some of his students and colleagues
back in Lexington. He was impressed
with the insight and engagement that stu-
dents provided and that undergraduates
asked most, if not all, of the post-panel
questions.

Beyond Tuesday’s election are the
nation’s recent economic troubles, an is-
sue that all three professors agreed will
be difﬁcult for either candidate to address
as the President of the United States.

Good work, CKP .

Robbie Turner, Mackenzie Brown win
national awards for Campus Kitchens work

Bylamle Klm
STAFF WRITER

One faculty member and one stu-
dent at Washington and Lee received
national recognition this past month
at the National Campus Kitchen Con-
ference for their active involvement
in and commitment to the Campus
Kitchen Project.

Robbie Turner, the former CKP
coordinator, won the Nopalitos Staff
Innovation Award while Senior
Mackenzie Brown won the Leah

_ Prudhomme Volunteer of the Year
Award.

“It’s an incredible statement about
our kitchen,” said Jenny Sproul ‘08,
the current CKP coordinator. “This
is only our third year, and we’re ac-
knowledged by the National Confer-
ence. It’s_exciting.”

Both Turner and Brown have con-
tributed countless hours to building
the Campus Kitchens Project with
new initiatives, programs and deliv-
ery sites.

Turner, who recently took charge
of the Bonner Leader Program, Na-
bors Service League and Volunteer
Venture Programs, was nominated
for the Nopalitos award for creat-
ing a work release program with the
Natural Bridge Juvenile Correction
Center.

“It’s a work release program where
cadets can go work on a regular basis.
They will get paid and get work skills
and life skills,” Turner said.

Starting the program a year ago, he
spent most of the year raising funds.
Now, Campus Kitchens is waiting for
the center to send cadets.

“I feel grateful to receive the
award, and just excited that it high-
lights all the work of Campus Kitch-
en volunteers, supporters, and every-
one at W&L who has made Campus
Kitchens successful,” Turner said.
“I’m also especially excited to see
how the work release program will
beneﬁt a teenager from NBJCC, and
our volunteers and the community in
the process.”

Senior Mackenzie Brown won the
Prudhomme award for accomplishing
many projects and initiatives, such
as running W&L Campus Kitchens
on her own during her internship this
past summer, working in the W&L
garden to supplement CKP meals,
moving Campus Kitchens to a new
location and expanding meal sites to

11 E
Washiiigton
Street

downtown Lexington.

“[The award] was a pleasant sur-
prise. Jenny didn’t tell me she had
nominated me,” Brown said. “lt’s
also great for the Kitchen.”

During her six-week summer
internship, Brown ran the Campus
Kitchen while Sproul took over as
CKP coordinator from Tumer.

“I was in charge of cooking, de-
livery, and pick-up shifts,” Brown
said. “There was a lot of help from
community members who volunteer
throughout the year."

This summer CKP used fresh pro-
duce from the W&L garden to serve
its clients. Originally an old lot used
by the Biology department, the gar-
den is used by Campus Kitchens, the

downtown Lexington, close to cam-
pus where it’s visible and reachable”
Brown said.

“[Brown] did an awesome job as
far as running the kitchen,” Sproul
said. “She did a lot of work with the
garden and expanded . .. to downtown
Lexington.”

One of Sproul’s inititiatives this
year was to divide the CKP leader-
ship team into ﬁve committees: Seed
to Feed, Fundraising, Volunteer Re-
cruitment, Delivery Expansion, and
Food resourcing.

Each committee is in charge of
speciﬁc tasks such as giving nutrition
classes, recruiting volunteers, and de-
livering food.

Two months have gone by since

“It is an incredible statement about our kitchen. This

is only our third year, and we ’re acknowledged by

the National Conference. It’s exciting. ”

Jenny Sproul, Campus Kltchens Coordlnator

Biology department and dining ser-
vices, Brown said.

“I went there once or twice a
week and helped with whatever they
needed to do. I did planting, weeding,
fencing, watering, just little odds and
ends,” she said. “We grew corn, to-
matoes, peppers, squash, and herbs.”

Since the Beta house was taken
back by the returning fraternity this
year, CKP had to ﬁnd another place
to operate in over the summer. Brown
took the lead and helped Campus
Kitchen move into its new location,
the Kappa Sig house.

“It’s deﬁnitely an adjustment,”
Brown said. “There is less counter
space, but it’s nice. One of the great-
est assets is that the coordinators’ of-
ﬁces are all on the same ﬂoor as the
kitchen. So it’s easier for people to
ﬁnd them whenever needed.”

Brown also contributed to expand-
ing meal sites to include the low-in-
come apartments at the Robert E. Lee
Hotel in downtown Lexington.

“[The residents] were not very
mobile, and I thought this might be a
good place to look into. I talked with
the manager of the apartment and af-
ter that we started serving meals to
the residents. It’s great that it is in

the Red

the beginning of the school year,
and CKP has already shown some
achievements in its many programs
and initiatives.

The nutrition classes for the cli-
ents are all set up and ready to start,
and the work release program with
Natural Bridge Juvenile Correction
Center is will take effect soon.

“We will also have Thanksgiving
Turkey Palooza, giving clients a full
Thanksgiving meal,” Sproul said. “It
will be at the Kappa Sig House and
other agency locations.”

She also wants to create an online
sign-up sheet where people can sign
up for volunteer shifts.

“People will be able to look at the
sign-up sheets online and see which
shifts are full or not,” she said.

Although Brown only began par-
ticipating in CKP recently this past
spring, she is now one of the 18 CKP
leaders and is enjoying every minute
of Campus Kitchen activities.

“Campus Kitchen is a great oppor-
tunity for students to get involved in
the community, build a relationship
and give back to the community,” she
said.

Give up on McCain

Looking around, it seems a lot of conservatives have

By Cody Beauchamp
OPINIONS EDITOR

For the well-read among us,
the name Christopher Hitchins
should ring a bell.

So too should: Colin Powell.

So too, perhaps: Scott Mc-
Clellan, Christopher Buckley,
Lincoln Chafee or Jeffrey Hart.

In case you’re not familiar
with all of them, they are (in or-
der): one of the foremost conser-
vative pundits of our day, one of
George W. Bush’s secretaries of
State, one of Bush’s press sec-
retaries, the son of the legend-
ary William F. Buckley (and a
former National Review colum-
nist), a former Republican Sena-
tor and the National Review’s
Senior Editor.

They all have two things in
common.

First, they are all conserva-
tive.

Second, they have all en-
dorsed Barack Obama - and not
John McCain - for President.

There are political defectors
in every political cycle.

This is nothing new. I

What is new--or perhaps fair-
ly remarkable at least--is the de-
gree and depth to which the Re-
publican party has been cripled
by defections this year.

It says something worth not-
ing, both that these conservative
darlings rejected McCain, and
endorsed someone as antitheti-
cal to their political leanings as
Obama.

After all, Obama is--even
most liberals are comfortable
conceding--fairly liberal.

Come to think of it, I’ve
heard the word “socialist” ban-
died about lately.

It’s not an accurate estima-
tion of Obama’s actual political
philosophies, strictly speaking,
but it’s still a good hint about
whether or not he’s far to the

lr.o..'z.@.;°l>§.......



~mu..m... ...a..~m«--*'‘””~~*~-~~»~»v ‘

left.

And that’s what’s remark-
able.

There is, apparently, such
disgust with John McCain as
a candidate, John McCain as a
campaigner, and John McCain
as prospective President that
even people as ultra—conserva-
tive as Hitchens cannot stomach
voting for him.

Nor, for that matter, can some
of W. Bush’s most fearsome at-
tack dogs.

That says something about
the sad state of the Republican
party-

Even more to the point, it
says something about the ut-
terly disrespectful and degrad-
ing campaign John McCain has
run in his desperate--and make
no mistake, narcissistic--bid to
become President.

I’ll concede John McCain is
a hero. I have before, in this pa-
per no less. V

The courage he showed as a
ﬁghter pilot during Vietnam is
laudable.

The courage he showed as a
prisoner of war during Vietnam
is downright, well, heroic.

I think it is highly commend-
able that he became a long-terrn
and very respected public ser-
vant after his years in the Hanoi
Hilton.

But, to put it bluntly, this
campaign has ruined him. ,

Part of it is due to forces
outside of his control. To put it
simply, he had the severe mis-
fortune to be the ﬁrst old white
man to run for the Presidency in
an election where being an old
white man was a liability.

He, like the Republican party
itself, apparently, did not know
how to respond.

But it goes so much deeper
than just the race issue (which,
there isn’t really much of one).

Believing McCain’s failure
has to do entirely with Obama’s
African-American identity is not
only shortchanging our nation’s
amazing transformation from
the country that tolerated Jim
Crow to the one that will--most
likely--elect a black man Presi-
dent tomorrow.

It is also shortchanging the
sheer, unbridled political skill
with which Barack Obama ran
his campaign.

And, it excuses McCain’s
shameful behavior as he - ever
more desperately - bid for the
White House.

In a race against the type of
smooth, controlled political op-
ponent he’s never really faced,
John McCain showed he cannot
adapt to the unforseen.

He proved he does not have
the capacity to deal with evolu-
tion, at least not the evolution of
a political landscape.

Obama raised millions more
than McCain by exploiting this
weakness.

Whereas McCain’s Internet,
cellular and “new media” cam-
paign efforts seemed stilted,
Obama’s were sleek and sophis-
ticated.

Whereas the Obama cam-
paign has hit upon a brilliant
new communication niche with
the text message, McCain is still
relying on robocalls and mail-
ers.

Whereas McCain still sought
to get the majority of his cam-
paign’s donations from tradi-
tional means, Obama created
an Internet-backed grassroots
donor program that has given
Obama enough money to where
he can now outspend McCain
eight to one on television ads in
Virginia, for instance.

It’s amazing.

But it’s not simply an issue
of who cmapaigned better.

As much praise as I have for
Obama’s campaign, I think the
reason McCain has been aban-
doned (and will lose tomorrow)
goes deeper.

' John McCain does not re-
spect the American voter.

Exhibit A could be his run-
ning mate. Simply put, Sarah
Palin is a disgraceful and insult-
ing excuse for a Vice Presiden-
tial candidate. She is no femi-
nist. She is no progressive.

Rather, she smacks of the
kind of Bushian ignorance that
almost demands voters to ques-
tion just what kind of fools John
McCain takes us for.

Or consider McCain’s stunt
when our economy was tanking
a few weeks ago.

Barack Obama heeded the
calls of the Senate leadership to
stay away.

McCain didn’t--obstinately
--and in the process not only
confused a good number of his
colleagues, but also showed us
just how Presidential his oppo-
nent is.

I could go on.

I could go on and talk about
just how insulting McCain’s
shameless appropriation of fall-
en Iraqi soldier’s memories for
the sake of his own presidential
campaign is.

I could talk about his tin
ear during the debates, or his
shameless attack ads--which,
I might point out, came before
Obama’s.

But I won’t.

I’ve not been betrayed by
John McCain.

But others have. I’d encour-
age you to read their far more el-
oquent arugments against him.

It says something about the
man that his ideological friends
can’t even vote for him.

- I’d encourage you not to ei-
ther.

It’s time for a post-election truce '

After one of the longest, messiest elections in our lives, its time to come together

By Abel Delgado
COLUMNIST

We deserved better than this.

While historians will long
remember the excitement this
presidential campaign generated,
I am completely disappointed
with what it didn’t produce——a
good clean race.

Barack Obama was the post-
partisan candidate of hope. He
was supposed to be above poli-
tics.

Instead he spent more money
on negative attacks ads than any
candidate in American history.
He spent his entire campaign
trying to turn John McCain
into George W. Bush and may
win because voters do not care
enough about records to know
the difference. _

Until recently, McCain was
the Democrats’ favorite Repub-
lican for crossing party lines.

His friendships with everyone
from Hillary Clinton to Tom
Daschle were well known and
everyone expected him to keep
the race civil.

Instead, the only constant in

' his campaign were its attacks on

his opponent.

We have to marvel at the size
Obama’s volunteer force and the
amount of money he has raised.
Yet, we should not ignore the
fact he broke his public ﬁnanc-
ing promise and he could very
well buy this election. ,

We have to marvel that John
McCain is in this race at all de-
spite it being a disastrous year
for his party. McCain’s repu-
tation and record have kept it
close, but we should not ignore
the fact that his reputation has
only been tarnished thanks to
one of the most poorly run cam-
paigns in recent memory.

We deserve better. Or do

we?

Some nutcase McCain sup-
porters call Obama an “Arab”
and a “terrorist.” If you think
that’s hurtful, imagine the pain
felt by the middle-aged woman
in New York who got attacked

violent aggressors I’m worried
about, it’s all of us.

We are all guilty of seeing the
“evils” of the other side clearly
while being completely unaware
of the mistakes our side makes.

This is no way for the country

We are all guilty of seeing the “evils” of the

other side clearly while being completely un-

aware of the mistakes our side makes. This

is no way for the country to get back up on

its feet.

by an Obama supporter for hold-
ing up a McCain sign or the
Florida man who got his head
slammed into a wall at a restau-
rant for supporting McCain in an
argument.

It’s not just the nutcases and

to get back up on its feet. For the
past few months I have blogged
relentlessly trying to provide
some political insight and many
of my friends to the left of me
joined the effort.

The more informed voices on

both sides, the better the debate.

We all showed how much we
cared about our country. We may
disagree on the course it should
take and the leaders we will
chose, but at least we all care
enough to inform ourselves and
voice our opinions.

This perhaps is the best out-
come of the race. The youth re-
ally does care now.

I have always and will al-
ways support John McCain. I
have stated my reasons to the
best of my ability, but if he loses
on Tuesday, Barack Obama is
my president and I will respect
him as such.

I will save my criticism for
him until he messes up and if
McCain wins I will not shy
away from criticizing him when
he messes up.

This is part of the truce I think
we should all make. Not a truce
to support our next president re-

gardless of whether he was our
ﬁrst choice, but to make sure
we hold him accountable for his
actions even if he was our ﬁrst
choice.

It is time we show we care
more about helping our country
succeed than helping one politi-
cian win an election. America
needs to come together to face
an economic nightmare and a
downright scary situation glob-
ally.

Nothing in this campaign has
made me think Obama or Mc-
Cain can truly unite us as “one
nation” and not “two ideolo-
gies.”

We need to unite ourselves.

We need to continue to care,
to debate, to discuss for our
country, and in the end we need
to call a truce between ourselves
so we can do what is best for our
country.

letter to the editor
Dear Ken: quit being a coward

Local teacher Bradley thinks Ruscio ’s dimissal of women 3 issues is deeply insulting

Two and a half years ago
Ken Ruscio was named presi-
dent of W&L.

In an interview posted on
the W&L Web site in conjunc-
tion with the announcement
of this, Ken Ruscio stated that
women’s issues were at the top
of his agenda.

In another context, he even
spoke of “striking a note of sol-
idarity” with the women who
had been adversely affected by
the climate on campus. ‘

Ken Ruscio subsequently
devoted the next two and a half
years to studying the issue.

Really, it took him two and
a half years.

Early in 2007 (nearly a year
after being named president),
he appointed a task force on
women to study the issue. This
committee released, after a year
and a half, a 100+ page report
that stated in no uncertain terms
that there are “signiﬁcant issues
related to gender that need to
be addressed” (p.9). The report
also stated that there is a wide-
spread feeling that the admin-
istration, and in particular the
president, do not share the view
that these issues exist and are
matters of pressing concern.

They place the onus for
change, in no uncertain terms,
squarely on the president’s
shoulders: “The forcefulness
and forthrightness of the Pres-
ident’s acknowledgement will
determine the success of all
subsequent efforts at improving
the climate for women at Wash-
ington and Lee” (p.9).

Yet somehow Ken Ruscio
has now come to the conclu-
sion that the concerns voiced
by women (and men), and the
incidents of gross sexual ha-
rassment reported, witnessed
and suffered among the under-
graduate, faculty, staff and ad-
ministrative ranks, are not re-
ally women’s issues after all.

On October 8, Ken Ruscio
spoke before the W&L com-
munity to lay out his vision and
recommendations for his Work-
Life initiatives.

Did he take this opportunity
to give a ‘forceful and forth-

right acknowledgement’ of
these gender issues, and to lay
out steps to deal with them?

No, he did not.

Instead he used this town
hall meeting to remove gender
issues from the discussion alto-
gether.

He quoted from the Task
Force on Women’s report to de-
clare that these issues “are not
women’s issues, per se.” (p.13)

Those rapes that occur in
university owned frat houses
and their university sanctioned
parties are not women’s issues.

The fact that there are still
professors on campus who
make it clear that women are
not welcome in their classes-
not a women’s issue.

The numerous and ongoing
complaints registered about ha-
rassment perpetrated by mem-
bers of the administration—not
a women’s issue.

Women faculty who are
held captive by the unabashed-
ly sexist remarks, attitudes, and
decisions of male faculty and
administrators, being told that
“women of [their] generation
are too sensitive,” being com-
plimented for their “matemal”
and “nurturing” contributions,
being subjected to scrutiny in
both job interviews and job
evaluations about their private
decisions concerning work and
family—not a women’s issue.

Yes, Ken Ruscio has sur-
prised us all.

Those who said he lacked
leadership, commitment, and
initiative (i.e. those who wrote
the report for his committee on
women), were wrong.

He has shown great leader-
ship.

Who else but a strong leader
could take a 100+ page report
(one that is entirely negative,
that can ﬁnd not one good thing
to say about the status of wom-
en at W&L, that singles out the
president for special blame),
and ﬁnd the one sentence in
it that allows him to discount
every other sentence in the re-
port.

Ruscio quotes from p.13 of
the report:

“[M]any of the climate is-
sues regarding women are not
women’s issues, per se, but
rather issues of community,
inclusiveness and respect for
individuals and other minority
groups. [They] voiced many of
the same concerns as women
who feel excluded (p. l3).”

He uses that to prove, in
his “Letter to the W&L Com-
munity” (October 8) and his
presentation that day that “the
concerns were not limited to
women.” Ken Ruscio, it must

purposes, the issue of women
has been laid to rest.

We need not speak of wom-
en’s issues.

Doesn’t his new report say
that their year-long study had
made it clear to the committee
that they weren’t really study-
ing women’s issues at all?

It takes a leader to so cyni-
cally and cowardly ignore the
ﬁndings of his own committee,
one he hand-picked with ex-
plicit orders to keep those who
might gum up the works off,

I suppose everyone over on campus can give

a sigh of relief that W&L doesn ’t have to

deal with all those “too sensitive, ” “men-

hating, ” ‘femi—nazz

‘I! II’

bitches” complain-

ing about women this and women that...Or,

someone can call Ken Ruscio on his coward-

ice and his bullying...

Patrick Bradley, RCHS Teacher

be noted, lifted that quotation
above from page 13 of the Task
Force on Women report, but
failed to cite the conclusion of
the paragraph in which it ap-
peared:

“That does not mean they
should not be addressed by
a committee on the status of
women, but rather that we as
a University should have clear
systems in place for address-
ing such community issues. For
example, if the proposed stand-
ing committee on the status of
women were to come across
issues that seem to be broader,
the committee should have an
avenue for ensuring that these
issues will be addressed by ap-
propriate groups or officials”
(p.13).

He has managed, through
selective reading and a coarse
intellectual legerdemain that
is disingenuous at best, to pro-
nounce that, for all intents and

and then to proclaim that he is
acting on the recommendations
of that committee.

Is there anyone who has
read the report from the Task
Force on Women who thinks
that committee was really ad-
vocating that women’s issues
should be dropped from the ac-
tive lexicon of the discussion?

I cannot believe that all
those people who spoke tothe
committee and the outside con-
sulting group, and those who
worked so long on that commit-
tee, really believe that there is
no warrant, no justiﬁcation for
looking at the concerns voiced
by women (and men!) as wom-
en’s issues “per se.”

Ken Ruscio has managed
to make the whole discussion
of the negatively gendered cli-
mate at W&L disappear with
one Latin phrase.

Just like a character from
the Harry Potter novels, he ut-

ters the Latinate spell, “PER
SE,” and ‘poof’ these issues
are no longer ‘intrinsically’
women’s issues, but just an-
other issue that another “series
of somethings” (his own char-
acterization of his study of the
situation) can resolve—as long,
that is, if we rely as our beacon
on the ever—ready two-headed
god: ‘honor and civility.’

In fact, Ken Ruscio states
quite clearly in his letter that
he will ﬁrst and foremost look
to the past in dealing with these
issues, proudly boasting, as if
to comfort his ﬂock, that his
take on this all “derives its ba-
sic values of community and
compassion from the past.”

What he ignores, however,
is his own Task Force’s ﬁnd-
ing that the past has not served
W&L at all well on these very
issues : “Washington and Lee
University is not yet a place
where it is easy to have a con-
versation about these issues,”
(p.9).

The Task Force, moreover,
“heard many accounts of wom-
en feeling marginalized, si-
lenced and excluded,” and con-
cluded that these feelings were
“pervasive” and “ubiquitous.”

Ken Ruscio never cited
those ﬁndings on October 8.

While Ken Ruscio may not
be afraid to throw around a Lat-
inate obfuscation, he certainly
can’t come to grips with calling
things by their proper names.

Like the old way to identify
a duck: if it harasses in a gen-
dered way, and intimidates in
a gendered way, and discrimi-
nates in a gendered way4it’s
gendered. And if your own
committee takes a year and
a half of their time to tell you
it’s gendered, then, damn it, it’s
gendered.

So, I suppose everyone over
on campus can give a sigh of
relief that W&L doesn’t have
to deal with all those “too sen-
sitive,” “men-hating,” “femi-
nazi” “bitches” complaining
about women this and women
that (FYI: these are just terms
that have been unapologetically
used by W&L faculty, adminis-

trators, and media).

Or, someone can call Ken
Ruscio on his cowardice and
his bullying, and let him know
that, while these are women’s
issues, we all suffer if they are
not dealt with.

W&L is a major employer
in our area.

W&L trumpets its ideals of
community, honor, and civility
ad nauseam.

‘ W&L places outsized em-
phasis on concepts of leader-
ship.

At the same time, however,
W&L sponsors fraternity par-
ties that are community hazards
when underage high school stu-
dents frequent them and young
women must be wary of sexual
assault when attending.

W&L is embarrassed on
a perennial basis by scandals
such as ‘The Bracket’, ‘The
List’, ‘Idaho’. «

It’s time W&L and its presi-
dent show some forceful and
forthright leadership in facing
up to these issues, calling things
by their proper names, looking
to the root causes, and opening
up the discourse and climate to
allow mature and diverse points
of view in.

If they do, there’s even a
good chance the institution will
survive.

Saturday night the Lenfest
Center welcomed the Columbia
Trio to the Wilson Hall stage.
Sponsored by SonoKlect, the
performance featured four selec-
tions of modern music arranged
for piano, violin, and cello. The
complexity of each of the works
beautifully exhibited the talent
and mastery of the performers.

The Columbia Trio includes
pianist David Riley, violin-
ist Fritz Gearhart, and cellist
Andrew Kolb. The group is
based in Eugene, Ore. and was
founded in 2007. All three
members were trained at the
Eastman School of Music, a
leading music conservatory lo-
cated in Rochester, N.Y. and as-
sociated with the University of
Rochester. Currently, both Riley
and Gearhart are faculty of the
University of Oregon School of

Columbia Trio, they blend to-
gether their backgrounds of
solo, orchestral, and chamber
music performance.

As the director of SonoKlect,
a concert series aimed at bring-
ing modern music to the Lenfest
Center, W&L music composition
professor Terry Vosbein gave
the evening’s opening remarks.
Vosbein dedicated the concert
to one his mentors, Donald Erb,
who passed away in August of
this year. Vosbein studied un-
der Erb in the early 1990s and
during that time, composed two
of the pieces the Columbia trio
performed during the concert.

The first piece of the evening
was one of Prof. Vosbein’s com-
position entitled “Trio No. 1.”
Composed in 1993, it was one
of the first he wrote under Erb’s
tutelage. Performed in one con-
tinuous movement, “Trio No.
1” eschews the ﬂowing lyricism
of traditional Romantic music,

Wade, a Rockbridge County
High School alumna, is now a
senior at Randolph College. She
performed both original mu-
sic and covers. She and Lalai
Damas guitarist Spencer McEl—
roy performed a duet. The two
were high school classmates and
often played together.

Last year’s performers, Rikki
Tikki Tavi and Agent Flynn, re-
turned to dining hall for another
rocking set.

Rikki Tikki TaVi’s folk-in-
spired tunes left the crowd clap-
ping along and crying for more.

lar, “angst-ridden cacophony”
of post-Romantic and modern

piece, especially, has a frantic
feel that explodes in the ﬁnal
moments.

Following Vosbein’s piece,
the Trio performed Shostakov-
ich’s 1944 composition “Piano

become set staples and campus
favorites. Morella also thrilled
the crowd with a solo folk ver-
sion of Rihanna’s “Take a Bow.”

Then came Agent Flynn.
Named after Samuel L. Jack-
son’s character from “Snakes on

a Plane,” the band regularly per- 1

forms at campus functions such
as Generals rallies and Battle of
the Bands.

The group has a Southern
rock feel and plays mostly clas-
sic rock covers.

Unfortunately, both bands
had to do without the presence
of Will Stewart, who was ill.

The evening was rounded
out by the Lalai Damas. Lead-

singer Malcolm Hines, a junior,
brought the funk to his group’s
set with a cover of OutKast’s
“Roses.” They also added a
trumpet to their sound for extra
oomph.

Throughout the evening, lis-
teners came and went at their lei-
sure for a laid-back atmosphere.
Baked goodies and coffee were
provided by Blue Sky Bakery as
an extra treat.

Wiggs and Morella were hap-
py with the turnout.

“It went just as well as we’d
hoped it would,” Morella said.
“We’re excited about bridging
the gap between WLUR and the
local music scene.”

They are looking forward to
another Music in the Market-
place next year.

Until then, they encourage
students to listen to WLUR, ei-
ther on their radios or online.

Wiggs and Morella host their
own weekly show “Cooking on
the Radio” Thursdays from 9 to
11 pm. All ofthe songs they play
have an easy-to-guess theme. If
a caller correctly guesses the
theme, they win, as Wiggs said,
“a travel-sized radio for rockin’
out on campus.”

Wiggs left saying, “Listen to
WLUR—it’s a laugh riot!”

Columbia Trio returned to the

work by Prof. Vosbein. “Trio
No. 2” was composed in 1995
and was one of the last pieces

Vosbein wrote while studying
under Mr. Erb.

Atthecomposition’spremiere
in Banff, Vosbein remarked that,
although most people would call
“Trio No. 2” absolute music --
music that does not tell a story
-- he believes the piece always
you to “create your own story as
you hear it.”

The three movements of the
piece are held together by clas-
sical music forms, though the
piece itself is modern. One au-
dience member described “Trio
No. 2” as “modem music in a
classical body.”

The last piece of the evening
was a collection of tangos by
Astor Piazzolla. Collectively
known as “Cuatro estaciénes
porteﬁas” each of the four “tan-
go-jazz” compositions bears
the name of a season, while
the adjective “porteﬁo” refers
to Buenos Aires. Though Piaz-
zolla composed each of the four
tangos separately, they are con-

nected by recurring thematic
clements. This ﬁnal piece was
an interesting departure from '
the evening’s other works, as it
was the only example of South
American music. The work’s
basis in the South American
dance tradition gave it a particu-
larly caliente quality.

The evening as a whole was
a wonderful celebration of the
vitality of modern music. In an
academic community that so
values tradition, it is pleasant to
experience progression in art.

Members of the W&L and
Lexington community were
treated to a concert that not only
showcased the talent of the bril-
liant Columbia Trio but also in-
troduced compositional creativ-
ity both abroad and right here at
home.

Pro-life group hosts candlelight vigil 

W&L Students for Life holds its second annual vigil to conclude nationwide grassroots campaign

By Valaree Tang
STAFF warren

The second annual candle-
light vigil for an end to abortion,
hosted by Washington and Lee
Students for Life, was held in the
Cohen Ampitheater on Novem-
ber 2 and marked the end of the
“40 Days ‘for Life” campaign.
The event was open to the Lex-
ington community.

40 Days for Life is a national
grassroots campaign aimed at
bringing an end to abortion. It
consists of prayer, fasting, and

vigil for 40 days.

The program consisted of
student testimonies, poems and
prayers. The main speaker of the
program was a representative
from ComfortCare Women’s
Health. She shared her story
about her experience with abor-
tion.

“Our speaker will be a wom-
an who will share her experi-
ence of having an abortion and
the regret and emotional distress
that she has faced since then,”
said Students for Life Secretary
Sarah Keckler.

The Life vigil was preceded
by forty days of prayer, held in
the Leybum Library. The group
prayed for mothers and their un-
born children.

Olivia Burr, a ﬁrst-year ac-
tive member, said she believed
the purpose of the vigil to be “to
raise awareness about the pro-
life message and to thoughtfully
reﬂect on the growing number
of human casualties that are the
product of on-demand abor-
tion.”

Club members wanted to in-
form the community that abor-

tion was not the only option in
an unwanted pregnancy. “I hope
that this club will be able to pro-
vide more resources for women
so that abortion will no longer
be the default decision when it
comes to an unplanned pregnan-
cy,” said Keckler.

“I also hope that through
events such as the vigil, we will
be able to show people how
abortion hurts not just the un-
born child, but the mother and
father as well.”

While this is the second year
that the vigil has taken place,

club ofﬁcers have higher ex-
pectations for the vigil this year.
“We are hoping that this year’s
vigil will have more partici-
pants,” said Keckler. “We hope
to grow a bit this year and we
also hope to make more people
actually care about the issue.”
The vigil ended in a candle-

light reﬂection and a call for in- ‘

dividual action upon the contro-
versial subject. It also included
statistics that were read at vari-
ous times during the vigil whose
“poignancy will hopefully help
people to understand the wide-

spread affects of abortion,” said
Keckler.

Burr said she endorses the
pro-life stance. “It devastates me
that innocent life is sacriﬁced in
our society for the sake of con-
venience,” she said.

“I believe that life is our ﬁrst
unalienable right and that adop-
tion is a healthier alternative for
pregnant women and their un-
born babies alike.”

Nabors hosts carnival for local children  

Nabors Service League and other volunteers paint faces and pumpkins with kids, give candy and prizes for Halloween

Nabors Service League host-
ed a Halloween carnival on the
BDG Quad Friday afternoon as
part of the Downtown Lexington
Trick-or-Treat Festival.

The Halloween Festival was
ﬁlled with Halloween activities,
lots of fun and tons of candy.
Dozens of local children moved
from table to table to color, have
their face painted, paint pump-

candy. «

According to Nabors Service
League General Chair Jenna
Walls, Nabors has been putting
on this event for the past four
years. Each year, the festival is
on the same day as downtown
Lexington’s Trick-or-Treat Fes-
tival. The organization asks dif-
ferent student organizations to
sponsor different activities dur-
ing the festival and has members
ofNabors ﬁll other roles.

Nabors had 12 student volun-

teers from various organizations
manning the activity stations.
The ladies of Chi Omega did
face painting while members of
Pi Beta Phi helped children paint
pumpkins.

“This is another way to pub-
licize about our organization and
to let the children have fun,” said
Special Projects and Events Co-
Chair Samara Francisco.

Professors and Lexington res-
idents brought their children to
join in the festivities. Over forty

kids, mostly between the ages of
four and six, walked around the
BDG Quad dressed in an array
of fun costumes. Fairies, ghosts,
dinosaurs and peacocks played,
painted pumpkins and colored
pictures of skeletons and haunt-

- ed houses. Even Mickey Mouse

and a blue Power Ranger came
to the festival.

If there’s one thing the

give his best Prince impres-
sions. Georgie Fruit makes
Ziggy Stardust seem like Paul
Simon. He spouts whatever is
on his mind, which, usually,
is his tremendous libido, giv-
ing “Skeletal Lamping” an
almost juvenile feel at times
as a result.

“Skeletal Lamping” has a
noticeably groovy feel to it,
and the music on the whole
is excellent. If nothing else,
Barnes trying to be a funk star
does have a degree of payoff,
but Barnes’ lyrics as Georgie
Fruit, on the whole, are some

all very well done, and both
“An Eluardian Instance” and
“Gallery Piece” stand among
some of Barnes’ best tracks.
The opening track, “Nonpa-
reil of Favor,” is a very inter-
esting and new sound for the
band, and Barnes still retains
his incredible knack for writ-
ing poppy, catchy, and well-
crafted hooks.

The whole album itself
seems to be made up of many
shorter movements strung to-
gether to make songs, and the
music behind Barnes’ ques-
tionable lyrics is very, very
good. If not for the ﬂawed
lyrics, “Skeletal Lamping”
could’ve been a worthy suc-
cessor to “Hissing Fauna,”
but instead it is merely a
mediocre trinket of Barnes’

newfound Georgie Fruit ob-
session. Fans will be divided,
but, if nothing else, there are
a few good tracks, and the
following tour looks to be the
biggest of the band’s career.

Men 3 soccer loses to Hampden—Sydney 1-0 on early goal, ends season 9-5-2

By Brooke Sutherland
surr warren

The Hampden-Sydney Col-
lege Tigers scored only one goal
in their match-up against the
Washington and Lee University
men’s soccer team, but it was
enough to bring the Generals’
season to a close.

Facing off in the ﬁrst round
of the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference playoffs, the Gener-
als kept the Tigers from scoring
again as sophomore goalkeep-
er Ben Bartlett recorded ﬁve

‘saves, but they simply could not

overcome the early goal by the
fou1th—seeded Tigers,

“They scored at the two min-
ute mark,” said assistant coach
Geoff del Forn. “It’s just so hard

to play when you have that I-0
deﬁcit.”

Added senior forward Whitt
Larkin, whose play was cited by
del Forn:

“When you get down early,
it changes the game. You know
you have to score, and that puts
more pressure on us to try to
take it to them. We started out
focusing on defense, but then
we had to shift to focus more
on scoring. I think it just took us
awhile to get comfortable and to
get in the ﬂow.”

Once they found their stride
on the ﬁeld, the Generals had
a much stronger second half
against the Tigers, particularly
on the defensive side, but it
wasn’t enough to clench the
victory.

“We showed a lot more pas-
sion, a lot more heart,” said se-
nior defender Fletcher McCraw.
“We deﬁnitely outplayed them.

too, but we just couldn’t knock
one in.”

The loss was certainly a dis-
appointing finish for the Gen-

“We were deﬁnitely hoping to make it to the

conference ﬁnal game, but it just wasn ’t in

the cards for us. We ’re sad it came to an
end, but the kids gave it their all and fought

GEOFF DEL FORN, assistant men’s soccer coach

 

On defense, we had that one
mistake early, but other than
that we could contain them. We
had a lot of shot opportunities

erals who ﬁnished the season
9-5-2 overall and 4-5-1 -in con-
ference play. _

After losing in the ODAC ﬁ-

nals last year to Roanoke, 2008
was only the second time in
nine years that the Generals did
not advance to the conference
semi—ﬁnals.

“We were deﬁnitely hoping
to make it to the conference ﬁ-
nal game, but it just wasn’t in
the cards for us,” del Forn said.
“It was a let down a little bit.
We’re sad it came to an end,
but the kids gave it their all and
fought hard.”

The loss after all cannot dis-
count what was for the most part
a successful season.

“Anytime you’re playing a
sport, you know your season is
going to end in a loss unless you
win the national championship
so I don’t think we can really
focus on that,” McCraw said.

“We battled a lot of adversity

were disappointed but also times
when we were excited. We’re
disappointed with the touma-

Behind a hat trick from Van Devender, women is
soccer crushes Guilford 6-0 in quarterﬁnals

By Adam Cancryn
STAFF WRITER

Senior forward Anne Van
Devender gave Watt Field one
more memorable performance
on Saturday, scoring three
goals en route to a 6-0 triumph
over Guilford for the Washing-
ton and Lee women’s soccer
team in the ODAC Quarterﬁ-
nals. She now leads the team
with 17 goals on the year.

Playing in her last home
game in Lexington, Van Dev-
ender wasted no time in leav-
ing her mark. Midway through
the ﬁrst half, she won a ball in
the open ﬁeld, eluded her de-
fender and found the back of
the net.

Following the goal, the
Generals never looked back,
dominating play and putting
consistent pressure on the
Guilford defense. Despite
some spectacular goalkeeping
by the Quakers’ senior Amber
Stapler, W&L found a way to
strike again before the half.

Fellow senior Marisa Van
Brunt placed a free kick right in
front of Van Devender, allow-

ing her to turn and volley the
bouncing ball over the keeper’s
head. It was Van Brunt’s third
assist of the season.

Having played and beaten
Guilford 5-0 just a week be-
fore, a 2-0 lead at the break
gave Coach Neil Cunningham
a sense of relief, but he knew
the team couldn’t afford a let-
down.

bring intensity into the game.”

The Generals quickly
squashed the idea of a letdown,
coming out of the break and
scoring another goal.

With the ball spending most
of its time in the Guilford end,
W&L continued to get a num-
ber of scoring chances. Van

“Playing a team you’ve just
beaten easily seven days be-
fore, it’s a hard thing to do,”
said Cunningham.

The women’s soccer team
hasnever lost to Guilford (22-
0-2), but the seniors needed no
extra motivation to get up for
the game.

“There’s a sense of no re-
grets,” said Van Devender. “In

Devender capitalized on an-
other opportunity, notching a
hat trick in the 50th minute.
The goal gave the senior
forward 17 on the year and
eight in her past four games.
W&L would score three
more times in the half on an
own goal and conversions by
sophomore midﬁelders Caro-
line Lamberti and Laura Yung-

meyer, capping off an outstand-
ing overall performance.

“We played really well. We
did a great job all around,” said
Coach Cunningham.

The win propels the third-
seeded Generals into the sec-
ond round of the ODAC tour-
nament. Lynchburg, the regular
season ODAC runner-up, will
host W&L in the conference
semiﬁnals on Wednesday. The
Hornets beat Randolph-Macon
7-0 Saturday in the ﬁrst round.

With a win in the semiﬁnals,’

W&L would reach the ODAC
Championship for the ﬁrst time
since 2004. After dropping a
2-1 overtime heartbreaker ear-
lier in the year to Lynchburg,
the team will have no problem
getting up for this match.

“We just have to play our
game, “ said Van Devender,
who emphasized the seniors’
no-regrets mentality. “We
deﬁnitely have the resources to
beat them.”

“We’re ready for them.
We’re done preparing... we
lost last time, so that gives us
the extra motivation we need,”
said Coach Cunningham.

Men ﬁnish third while women take ﬁrst for ﬁfth-straight year

By Kevin Corn
STAFF wrmzn

The Washington and Lee men’s and
women’s cross country teams spent Sat-
urday in Virginia Beach, Va., at the 2008
ODAC Championships. The women took
their ﬁfth straight title while the men ﬁn-
ished third, only nine points out of ﬁrst.

Both teams racked up additional ae-
colades, including women’s coach Kris
Hoey who was named ODAC Women’s
Cross Country Coach of the Year for the
ﬁfth time.

The women were led by senior Jessica
Shaw who ﬁnished ﬁrst with a time of
21 :41 — a time that helped make her the
ODAC Runner of the Year. Senior Eliza-
beth Webb took second after crossing the
ﬁnish line in a time of2l:54 while senior
Becca Taylor ﬁnished with a time of 22:26
for a four'th-place ﬁnish. Junior Dorothy
Todd was close behind Taylor with a time
of 22:52, placing seventh.

Taylor also was named ODAC Wom-
en’s Cross Country Scholar-Athlete of
the year for the third-straight year. Shaw,
Webb, Taylor, and Todd were all named
F irst-Team All-ODAC runners.

Webb commented that the meet “was a
culmination of nearly six months of hard
work." She continued, “Even though we
have national ambitions for this season,
we made sure not to lose sight of the fact
that we needed to defend our ODAC title
ﬁrst. Everyone truly came through and
contributed in a big way.”

Finishing close behind were junior Kat
Telfeyan and sophomores Katherine Fen-
wick and Christine Balistreri. Telfeyan
took ninth with a time of 23:06 while Fen-
wick ﬁnished in a time of 23:22 to place

eleventh. Balistreri captured fourteenth
with a time of 23:32. All three were named
Second Team All-ODAC ‘honorees.

“Our success comes from running as a
team, working together, and understand-
ing both each others’ strengths and where
we need that extra support,” stated Tay-
lor. “Each girl on the team contributes so
much to the team’s success and to my own

one shoe.”

“Overall, our team this year would have
beaten last year‘s ODAC champs [W&L]
fairly handily," commented Ivy. “In other
words, we all ran to the best of our ability
and that’s all we could ask for.”

than I thought possible.”

The men faced stiff competition this
year but rose to the occasion. Senior
Michael Welsh led the Generals with
his third-place ﬁnish in a time oi‘ 25:33.
Senior Vance Berry was close behind,
crossing the ﬁnish line in a time of25:44
for ﬁfth place. Welsh and Ber'ry’s perfor-
mance earned them First Team All-ODAC
honors.

Sophomore Jack lvy was awarded
Second Team All-ODAC honors with his
eight place ﬁnish and time of 25:54. Se-
nior Alex Jackson rounded out the top 20
with his ﬁnish in a time of26:37.

Jackson ran an amazing race consid-

rectly to the commitments made by indi-
viduals early in the season and over the
summer” added Jackson. “Without people
stepping up and replacing positions on the
team lost to last year’s graduating class,
we wouldn’t have been as successful.”

“The 1ncn’s third place ﬁnish, while not
being enough to win a ﬁfth conference title
was still very satisfying as only 9 points
separated ﬁrst and third,” concluded Jack-
son. “Wc are a signiﬁcantly stronger team
this year than even last season.”

Field hockey advances to semis
Generals beat Virginia Wesleyan in ODAC Quarterﬁnals

After a blowout 5-1 win over Vir-J
ginia Wesleyan Collcge on Saturday in
the ﬁrst round of the ODAC tournament,
the Washington & Lee ﬁeld hockey team
will advance to the semiﬁnal round on
Wednesday against Eastern Mennonite
University (EMU).

The Generals faced Virginia Wesleyan
in the regular season on October 18. A
different day ended in the same score and
result: a 5-1 W&L victory with four goals
scored in the ﬁrst half and one in the sec-
ond while the Marlins scored their goal
late in the second.

W&L put a point on the scoreboard
in the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes when junior for-
ward Sallie Armstrong scored an unas-
sisted goal. Senior forwards Christina
Merchant and Melissa Dolan teamed up
on Merchant’s ﬁrst goal at the 18:50 mark
of the ﬁrst half. Just three minutes later
Merchant scored her second goal off of an
assist from senior defender Liz Garson.

Sophomore forward Poppy Hall
brought the score to 4-0 at the 24:04 mark
off of an incoming shot from fellow soph-
omore Jennie Norcini.

The second half amounted to a great
showing from the Generals defense. Nor-
cini came up with a defensive save while
junior Grace McGee and ﬁrst-year Lizz
Dye notched two apiece.

Armstrong complimented the Gener-
