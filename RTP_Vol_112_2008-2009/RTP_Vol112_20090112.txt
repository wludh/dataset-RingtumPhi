BY THE FOR THE STUDENTS SINCE

1397 VOLUME cxu, NUMBER 10

 

   

By Jamie Kim
STAFF WRITER

As theft incidents in the
Washington and Lee community
increase, local police ofﬁcers
urge students to be more careful
with their personal property.

In December, the Rockbridge
County Sheriff’s Ofﬁce arrested
Donna Kay Frazier, 45, and
charged her with felony, grand
larceny and misdemeanor petty
larceny. The Lexington Police
Department also charged Frazier
with two felony grand larcenies
and two misdemeanors.

Frazier has been a suspect in
larcenies around the W&L coin-
munity and the investigation of
her alleged crimes continues.

According to the police re-
port, a W&L law student, who
wished not to be identiﬁed or
interviewed, reported on Dec.
9' that her packages were sto-
len on three different occasions.
The following day, Ofﬁcer Tim
Hickman of the Sheriff’s ofﬁce

had a package delivered to her
residence and observed the area.
Later he noticed a vehicle come
into the parking lot and circle the
student’s residence three times.

Hickman went to the stu-
dents residence the following
morning and soon spotted the
same vehicle driven by Frazier.
She got out, walked up to the
victim’s apartment, and took the
package that had been sitting in
front of the door since the day
before.

When Hickman approached
her and asked her what she was
doing, Frazier said she was pick-
ing a package up for a friend,
but when he asked again who
her friend was, she could not
produce a name. Hickman later
obtained a search warrant and
searched Frazier’s residence.

“She says it was a single inci-_

dent, but we searched her house
and found additional items, like
GPS [units] and iPods,” Hick-
man said.

“It doesn’t take a lot to real-

Local woman charged with thefts, po

ize that one person doesn’t need
ﬁve iPods,” said Ofﬁcer Andy
Tanner of the Lexington Police
Department, who searched the
house with Hickman and other
ofﬁcers.

Frazier had actually been
caught before in a vehicle ‘be-

in the past.

“A lot of things get taken all
_the time. We got lucky this time
to have found a suspect,” said
Tanner. “She invoked her right
to counsel and called her attor-
ney.”

Frazier is to go to a prelimi-

“She doesn ’t seem to have a lot of experi-

ence or she may have done it simply for the

thrill and the adrenaline rush. My specula-

tion is that she may either be an inexperi-
enced thief or a thrill thief ”

longing to a W&L student, but
the student did not prosecute,
according to the police report.
Of the items conﬁscated from
Frazier’s house, one GPS unit
and one iPod belonged to W&L
students. Sgt. Mark Riley said
Frazier may have been involved
in other theft incidents reported

nary district hearing on Feb. 10.
After that, she will proceed to
the grand jury and the circuit
court.

“What’s very strange is that
she still had those items that she
stole a while ago,” Tanner said.

The GPS unit and iPod be-
longing to students were stolen

in late of October.

Usually, thieves either pawn
stolen items or sell them online,
most frequently on eBay, Tanner
said. Pawn shops are required by
law to keep records of all items
they buy. They hold the items
for a certain period and require
ID information.

But eBay has none of those
constraints.

“You don’t know who you’re
dealing with,” said Tanner.

Ofﬁcers will attempt to ac-
cess Frazier’s eBay account to
see if she has sold any stolen
items online, he said.

“She doesn’t seem to have
a lot of experience or she may
have done it simply for the thrill
and the adrenaline rush,” said
Tanner. “My speculation is that
she may either be an inexperi-
enced thief or a thrill thief.”

He further cautioned students
to take extra care of their per-
sonal items.

“These thefts are uniquely a
student problem,” he said, add-

ing that students can be “na‘1've’
in how they deal with their per-
sonal safety issues.

About two years ago, Sgt. Ri-
ley arrested professional thieves
who had broken into several
classrooms of W&L and had
stolen electronic projectors from
the ceilings, Tanner said. Riley
later found out that those projec-
tors had been sold on eBay and
had been shipped to Baltimore.
He was able to recover the'pro-
jectors that were worth $50,000-
60,000.

Such incidents are rare at
W&L, but minor thefts such
as Frazier’s commonly occur
around college campuses, Ri-
ley said. The economy today is
likely to exacerbate crime rates,
Riley said.

“When the economy’s bad,
statistically, theft tends to rise.
Bad economy pushes people
across the line to do something
they wouldn’t normally do,” he
said.

W&L’s endowment bleeds $124m

Endowment drops by I 7 percent in 5 mos., administrators blame the economy

By Queenie Wong
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee Uni-
versity’s endowment lost about
$124 million in ﬁve months, a
17 percent drop in its market
value since July l.

The decline brings the en-
dowment from $720 million on
July 1 to around $596 million at
the end of November, Universi-
ty Treasurer Steven McAllister
said.

The plunge in asset values
during the ﬁnancial crisis contin-
ues to take its toll on higher edu-
cation nationwide. Last month
Harvard——the world’s wealthiest
university--announced a record

22 percent or $8 billion drop in
its endowment.

“This is clearly the worst pe-
riod that I’ve seen...in terms of
the market impact on [W&L’s]
endowment,” said McAllister.

The loss will mean a reduc-
tion in endowment payout, used
to support university operations,
in 2009 and 2010, McAllister
said.

The shrinking endowment
will also decrease the annual
capital budget, which is primar-
ily used for projects, he said.

Two major projects, the con-
struction of the Hillel House
and the renovation of the Col-
onnade, both depend on gifts.
In other words, fundraising will

dictate whether those two proj-
ects move forward in the next
school year, McAllister said.

To counteract the possibility
of a shrinking endowment, the
university created a $20 to $21

losses.

“We’re certainly going to do
our fair amount of belt tighten-
ing. It’s not going to be a period
of growth for the university in
terms of the traditional sense of

“Washington and Lee has been around for

over 200 years and it is not going to go down

over this. We ’ll manage it. ”

million endowment shortfall re-
serve in the last several years, a
move that McAllister said will
soften the blow of any future

business, but it’s also not going
to be a period, I don’t believe,‘
of heavy retrenching at the uni-
versity.” ‘

Provost June Aprille agrees.

“Washington and Lee has
been around for over 200 years
and it’s not going to go down
over this. We’ll manage it,”
Aprille said.

With 35 percent of the en-
dowment allocated to under-
graduate ﬁnancial aid, Aprille
and McAllister emphasized their
commitment to the students.

McAllister said the univer-
sity wants to make sure that the
school is affordable for all of its
students‘.

Since it’s unclear whether ﬁ-
nancial markets will decline, sta-
bilize or grow in coming years,
the Board of Trustees plans to
discuss different economic sce-

narios at February’s board meet-
ing, McAllister said.

Gerry Lenfest, an alumnus
and philanthropist, urged others
to continue giving to the univer-
sity despite the harsh economic
climate.

“Now is the time to step up

because the university needs it '

more than ever,” Lenfest said.

Gerry Lenfest donates $17 In

Two new endowments will allow formore sabbaticals and summer research

 

COURTESY OF THE W&L WEB SITE

A $17 million gift from Gerry Lenfest,
W&L class of 1953, and W&L Law
School class of 1955, will fund new
research grants and faculty sabbati-

cals.

By Queenie Wong
STAFF WRITER

A $17 million gift by Gerry Len-
fest, a university alumnus and philan-
thropist, will increase the number of
year-long faculty sabbaticals and add
funding for summer research grants.

Lenfest’s two endowments will
fund at least 90 individual research
grants every summer, increasing each
award by $2500, University Provost
June Aprille said. Up to 10 faculty
members will be able to leave on full-
salaried sabbaticals each year.

“His leadership in contributing to
and promoting endowments is un-
precedented,” said Aprille.

The gift also furthers the universi-
ty’s ten-year strategic plan “A Liberal
Arts Education for the 215‘ Century,”
launched in 2007. The plan calls for
the recruitment, retention and devel-
opment of exceptionally qualiﬁed
faculty and staff committed to the
university’s values outlined in the uni-
Vesrity’s strategic plan, Aprille said.

Lenfest’s latest gift brings his to-

tal support of faculty to $50 million.

‘ In 2007, he committed $33 million to

help the university pay its professors
competitive salaries.
“Among all the gifts of philanthro-

dents and the quality of the faculty.

py, I think giving back to the school
I went to is the most important,” said
Lenfest, a member of W&L’s Class
of 1953 and the W&L School of Law
Class of 1955.

There are two components that
make up a ﬁne institution like W&L,

on year-long sabbaticals because the
university could only pay half their
full salaries, Aprille said. The univer-
sity relied on external grants and fel-
lowships to make up the difference for
some faculty members. '
“We know it’s very advantageous

for some faculty members at certain
stages of their career to be gone for the
entire year. They can get a lot more re-
search done, ﬁnish a book, start a new
lab project,” she said.

After the Mellon Career Trajecto-
ries Grant expired last year, Aprille
approached Lenfest with the idea of
an endowment for faculty support.

Lenfest responded with a gift of $9
million for faculty sabbaticals and $8
million for summer research, which
he committed to last July.

With more funding, Aprille ex-
pects more faculty members to apply
for year-long sabbaticals and summer
research grants this year. Aprille will
consult with the deans of the College
and the Williams School of Com-
merce, Economics and Politics to ad-
minister both programs.

Applications for a faculty summer

research grant, due January 26, are .

available on the university’s Web site.

W®RST WEEK

Rush is brutal and Tear Night is
ridiculous. We need a change.

It’s a minor miracle that we have as many articles in this week’s
issue as we do.

Who knew there were that many upperclassmen independents?

All joking aside, Greek formal recruitment (“Rush” to us older
hands) is pretty brutal. For a week, it seems the entire campus is ob-
sessed. First-years and others who are rushing are done. You’re get-
ting zilch out of them when it comes to class or studies. Zip. Nada.

Most upperclassmen aren’t much better. If you’re an upper-

wrath for not rushing. Or you’re hiding at the Palms.

If you’re an upperclasswoman in a sorority? Well, the absolutely
soul-consuming nature of srat rush needs no introduction anymore,
does it?

We think having Freud explain his theories about the super-ego
to us in the original German would be easier to understand than how
Panhel’s recruitment system works.

And that’s even considering the way in which ﬁrst-year women
are essentially run through a giant grinder emotionally for a week
solid. We don’t know how that mythical supercomputer hidden in
Terri Cugliari’s ofﬁce is supposed to work, but we know it’s sure not
programmed to consider raw feelings.

And then there’s Tear Night. Although we here at the Phi usually
don’t wait on pins and needles to read our rival rag, we’re all look-
ing forward to the frat / srat / Plan-B stats that will come out later in
this week’s Trident.

Even when ‘our national GDP stops growing, We’re willing to bet
the health center stats keep booming like it’s the 90s and we’re in
Silicon Valley. W&L should invest some of the endowment in Tro-
jan and Durex. Seriously.

So what are we getting at? Is this the annual “down with frats”
column the Trident seems to think were under contract to write?

Are those nerds at the Phi calling for end of almighty Greek-
dom?

No. But it’s time to re-assess things.

Whatever happened to that oh-so-promising initiative Panhel and
the IFC ﬂirted with after last year’s disastrous Tear Night? Where
are those exciting new proposals and ideas for improving the system
that Alex Duckworth and Jackie DiBiasie were telling us all about
a year ago?  

Our understanding is that the Greek Vision committees are -still
meeting. What of it? It’s time for our IFC and Panhel to start either
considering their recommendations or demanding they make some.

Because though we all love our frats and stats, this last week was
rough. It’s time for us to make it easier and better for all. It’s too
brutal right now.

 
 

classman in a fraternity, you’re either rushing like a maniac to win ‘
a freshman over a rival frat, or you’re attracting your rush chair’s

Not ‘Sweet Caroline’

Just being a Kennedy shouldn ’t make you a Senator

By Abel Delgado
COLU M NIST

Someone needs to tell Caro-
line Kennedy the upper house
of Congress is not the House of
Lords.

The party that claims to rep-
resent middle and working class
Americans is seriously consider-
ing appointing a daughter of a
former president with no public
oﬂice experience to the Senate
seat currently occupied by the
wife of a former president who
had no public office experience
when she won it. The word nep-
otism deﬁnitely comes to mind.

What happened to our great
meritocracy? Wasn’t the elec-
tion of President-Elect Obama
supposed to prove that anyone,
regardless of background, could
aspire to be president? Well we
can all dream of being president
one day, but unless we belong
to a political royal family, we
should give up all hope of serv-
ing as Senator from New York.

Just a few months ago, it was
Democrats who were ridicul-
ing a relatively inexperienced
woman running for high ofﬁce,
but at least Sarah Palin was self-
made and came from the work-
ing class. '

Now some Democrats are
favoring a completely inexperi-
enced woman running for high
ofﬁce who was apparently born
with the silver spoon and the
Senate seat, or throne, to look
forward to. Republicans would
do well to have a ﬁeld day with
this.

look like “Sweet Caroline” was
into politics. One of the reasons
New York Governor David Pa-
terson saidjhe was considering
Kennedy for the seat is her close
relationship with President-Elect
Obama, so we can add cronyism
to the list of words that come to
mind as well. Kennedy didn’t

Kennedy has absolutely no legislative experi-

ence and no real political experience unless

you count the 2008 election speeches and

Veep advice she gave for Obama.

Is this change we can believe
in? Kennedy has absolutely no
legislative experience and no
real political experience unless
you count the 2008 election
speeches and Veep advice she
gave for Obama. Her public
service record is basically a list
of charitable boards she sits on.
Up until Kennedy and her uncle,
Senator Ted Kennedy of Mas-
sachusetts, threw their support
behind Obama during the Dem-
ocratic primaries, it didn’t even

even bother voting in some key
elections for Democrats in New
York. At least she didn’t come to
New York solely to run for the
Senate, which is an improve-
ment from the Senator she may
be replacing.

America is not supposed to
have political family dynasties;
the House of Bush should have
proved that. But do not tell this
to the House of Kennedy or
the House of Clinton, for they
are determined to stay relevant.

With all the problems and scan-
dals that greeted Democrats who
recently arrived in Congress,
having to explain why Caroline
Kennedy has earned her place in
“the most exclusive clu ”
going to cause more headaches
and give Republicans more
openings.

Republicans are just as ca-
pable of nepotism and political
dynasties, but former Florida
Governor Jeb Bush did them
a favor when he took his name
off the list of potential candi-
dates to replace Florida Senator
Mel Martinez in 2010. It’s not
that Bush was inexperienced; he
was very successful and popular
Governor, but Bush understood
his last name was toxic and that
Republicans needed new names.
It was no accident that one of the
ﬁrst people Bush called once he
made his decision was Marco
Rubio, the Florida Republican
and former State Speaker of the
House who is considered a rising
star in the party.

Democrats, after ﬁnding suc-
cess-with an untraditional can-
didate, look like they’re return-
ing to their old ways. Here’s to
wondering if anything has really
changed at all.

Time for usto ditch politics as usual

We need all that change we can believe in sooner rather than later, please

By Jacob Geiger
COLU MNIST

Withvthe United States cur-
rently mired in a 13-month
long recession that may last
for at least another year, there’s
no question that the last few
months have not been “business
as usual.”

During Washington and
Lee’s fall term we saw the fail-
ure of Lehman Brothers; the
nationalization of insurance gi-
ant AIG plus mortgage lenders
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mac; a
$700 billion bailout of the ﬁnan-
cial system and a smaller ~ but
equally controversial — bailout
of General Motors and Chrys-
ler.

But despite the incredible
economic crisis — not to men-
tion a new foreign policy crisis
in the Middle East — the last
six weeks have been politics as
usual.

Illinois led off the parade
of idiocy with the arrest of its
governor, Rod
Blagojevich, after a special

prosecutor uncovered evidence
that Blago, as he’s known in his
home state, was brazenly trying
to sell President-elect Barack
Obama’s Senate seat to the
highest bidder.

Despite initially sayingafter
his arrest that he would not ap-
point anyone to the seat, Blago-
jevich changed course on Dec.
30 and appointed Roland Burris,
a former state attorney general.

That led us to last week’s
ﬁasco, as Burris arrived for
the ﬁrst day of the new Senate
session even though he knew
his appointment papers had
not been signed by the Illinois
Secretary of State, as the law
requires. He showed up even
knowing that Senate Majority
Leader Harry Reid had already
said he would not be seated or
admitted by the Senate.

So on a day that Alcoa, one
of the nation’s largest industrial
companies, announced that it
was laying off ‘l3,500 work-
ers, the Senate was focused on
whether or not it should admit
the appointment of a governor

whose ego and idiocy is ex-
ceeded only by his alleged cor-
ruption.

This whole disaster doesn’t
even begin to touch on Minne-
sota, where Democrat Al Frank-
en and Republican Norm Cole-
man are still squabbling over
who won that Senate race back
in November. Coleman led by
about 215 votes when the polls
closed on Election Night, but a
recount that was certiﬁed last
week gave Franken a 225-vote
lead. Coleman announced I an. 6
that he was suing to reverse the
result, meaning Minnesota may
be one senator short for several
months.

Republicans have also made
some stupid mistakes lately.
Chip Saltsman, a former leader
Tennessee GOP who is a candi-
date to become the new chair-
man of the Republican National
Committee, sent out a Christmas
CD that included a song titled
“Barack the Magic Negro.”

Saltsman said the song was
clearly a satire, but he mostly
managed to prove that idiocy is

truly a bipartisan position these I

days.

We’re essentially a po-

_ litically paralyzed nation right

now. President George Bush is
perhaps the lamest duck in the
history of lame ducks. Obama
is refusing to make any ma-
jor statements about economic
policy or the new war in Gaza,
arguing that the nation can only
have one president at a time.
From a technical standpoint,
he’s right, but that basically
means the U.S. has no president
right now.

This transition period be-
tween presidents is usually a
quiet one, but with a war in the
Middle East and an economic
crisis, the world is not cooperat-
ing with our power vacuum this
time around.

Change may have come to
America, as Obama said in his
Election Night speech, but the
last few weeks have also proved

’ that some things in the political

world — like greed, arrogance
and stupidity — will never
change.

Israel’s attacks on Hamas justiﬁed

F resh-back from the Holy Land, columnist Brain Cherry defends Israeli strikes

By Brian Cherry
co LU MNIST

Having visited Israel over
my winter break, including hav-
ing been there when the war
broke out, I feel it necessary to
give my opinion on the conﬂict,
and hopefully shed light on a
few misconceptions many peo-
ple may have about the Israel-
Hamas conflict which may have
been caused by extreme anti-Is-
rael bias in the media. '

For the past two weeks, the
Israel Defense Force (IDF) has
led an offensive inside the Gaza
strip with the goal of weaken-
ing, if not destroying, Hamas,
a terrorist organization centered
in Gaza. According to Hamas’
charter, the sole purpose of the
group’s existence is to destroy
the state of Israel.

It should not be surprising
that relations between Israel and
Hamas have not been peaceful

since Hamas’ establishment in

1987. Between February 2008

and June 18, 2008, Israel saw
approximately 1,900 rockets
ﬁred into its borders by Hamas
militants in the Gaza strip.

In June of 2008, however,
Egypt helped mediate a six-
month ceaseﬁre between Israel

. and Hamas set to begin on June
19. After the beginning of the
ceaseﬁre the rocket ﬁre into Is-
rael decreased signiﬁcantly but
did not stop. On November 4,
2008, however, Israel also vio-
lated the ceaseﬁre by killing 6
Hamas gunmen upon discover-
ing a tunnel into Israel that had
been built by Hamas (not only
was this tunnel built completely
illegally, but the tunnel was not
built with peaceful intentions).
Following this incident rocket
ﬁre into Israel has increased,
leading to more Israeli civilian
casualties and property damage.

Despite demands by Israel
for the rocket ﬁre to stop, Hamas
rejected a renewing of the truce
established in June.

Israel had no choice but to
lead an assault on the organiza-
tion attacking its civilians.

News coverage of this con-
ﬂict in Gaza has shown the world
pictures of civilian casualties,
calling Israel a “terror state.”

Some are even going as far as
to call the conﬂict genocide and
comparing the conﬂict to the
Holocaust (such statements and
comparisons are outrageous).

The vast majority of casual-
ties in Gaza have not been civil-
ian casualties.

Israel attacks where Hamas‘

is, however, and Hamas has be-
trayed the people of Gaza by hav-
ing bases in schools, mosques,
and other public areas.

Hamas does not care if the
people of Gaza die, because the

more civilian casualties there
are, the more sympathy they
will receive from the rest of the
world. If the people of Gaza
would rise, up against the Hamas
militants, or at least support the
IDF, Hamas would be defeated
and no more civilians would
die.

When a state sees its citizens,
its civilians nonetheless, being
attacked by militants in an orga-
nization, they have no choice but
to defend their people.

Hamas exists only with the
goal of destroying Israel. Be-
cause of this, it is Israel’s duty to
see to its destruction.

Just like the United States
has led a War on Terror to see
to the destruction of terrorist
organizations around the world
who wish to see the destruction
of the United States, Israel has a

responsibility to destroy Hamas. I

Only then will there be peace.

In a variety of ways.

The familiarity of the Staniar
Gallery greets a veteran visitor.
The same glass doors, the same
wooden ﬂoors.

Something is different about it
this time, however. Weightless, the
current exhibit by Satoru Hoshino
and Michael Kenna, envelops the
viewer in its ambience.

The exhibit is a surprising
blend of mediums, incorporat-
ing Hoshino’s ceramic pieces and
Kenna’s black and white photo-
graphs. Although the works of the
two artists are seemingly different,
the exhibit still retains a profound
coherence.

Large, generally indiscemible
dark shapes, are immediately ap-
parent to anyone even walking
by. Upon seeing these shapes, the
viewer might feel almost as though

he has entered some sort of dream
world.

The massive, abstracted ﬁgures
are more easily compared to sculp-
ture than to any ceramics.

Upon closer examination, the
black and white photographs inter-
spersed with the ceramics reveal
their beauty and signiﬁcance. The
images are small, but powerful.

One in particular features a
scene somehow familiar to most.
At ﬁrst glance, the photograph is
of an ordinary‘ Seascape. But, if
you look closely, Kenna’s photo-
graph reveals a curious deﬁance of
physics. ‘

One large stone seems to be
supported by an impossibly small
base. The land above it, weighing
hundreds of tons by any estima-
tion but somehow retains a power-
ful stability.

The beauty of Kenna’s work
lies in its ability to evoke powerful
emotion.

Hoshino mimics these same

shapes in one of his larger works.
The pieces themselves look to be
made up of small, dark ceramic
stones that seem tiny enough to ﬁt
in the palm of your hand. The artist
creates a structure with the same
concept: a large mass precariously
balanced on a small point.

More astonishing is the fact
that these huge works are made of
such small components.

Hoshino’s efforts are obvious,
but the viewer never feels the
stress of the artist’s attention to de-
tail and the amount of time it took
to construct such a piece.

Instead, Hoshino’s works con-
tribute to the sense of calm that
can be consistently felt throughout
the entire exhibit.

Saturo Hoshino is a Japanese
ceramicist of international ac-
claim. He has exhibited his unique
pieces in galleries throughout the
world, including Japan, Europe
and the United States.

As a craftsman, his specialty

lies in post—object ceramics.

Michael Kenna’s work has been
featured in countless exhibits in-
ternationally since 1979. Kenna’s
inspiration for the exhibit came
from a book he wrote entitled Ja-
pan Which was published in 2006.

He has authored several other
books in addition to Japan.

Kenna currently resides in Se-
attle, Wash.

Weightless will be exhibited
in the Stanair gallery from Jan 5
until Jan 30 during regular gallery
hours.

There will be an opening lec-
ture with a reception to follow on
Jan 22 at 6:00 pm.

The exhibit evokes a rare sense
of tranquility. Both artists have
produced striking works through
very different mediums. Howev-
er, both ceramics and photography
work together to produce an unex-
pected sense of balance.

Artists get their
pictures moving

Two photographers chose to
feature dance in their work

By Joan Oguntlmein
5 TA F F W RITE R

“Celebrating Dance through
Photography” is a photo exhibit
showcasing work from photogra-
phers Kevin Remington and Fran-
ces Dowdy. The exhibit opened in
Kamen Gallery, the atrium of Len-
fest Hall, on Jan 7 and will continue
until Mar 31..

Remington, an award—winning
photojournalist, began photograph-
ing dance four years ago and like

est,“ said Dowdy of her class in
her artist’s statement. “Aside from
the personal nature of portraiture,
much of my satisfaction comes
from the process. . .of taking each
portrait beyond being a mere pho-
tograph and making it a work of
art.”

Though she opened a portrait
studio in Atlanta, her fascination
with dance and speciﬁcally, dancers
led her to photographing dancers
for her personal work. As her work
in the exhibit shows, Dowdy, as she

 much of my satisfaction comes from... taking

each portrait beond a mere photograph and mak-

ing it a work of art...each dancer brings his or her

unique experience...and our collaboration takes

us on an extraordinary photographic journey

Frances Dowdy, artist

many admirers of his work, he fell
in love with the emotion, light and
motion that his photographs cap-
ture.

q Remington is currently the pho-
tographer for both Washington and
Lee University and the Virginia
Military Institute. Many of Rem-
ington’s photographs in the exhibit
feature students from the W&L
Repertory Dance Company. His
photos document the dance com-
pany’s performances from the last
two years. Some photographs were
taken during Professor Jennifer Da-
vies’s dance class

“The images that come alive are
deﬁnitely most amazing,” Reming-
ton said.

Remington used a slow shut-
ter speed to capture blur to show
motion. His favorite piece in the
exhibit is a photograph with a girl
with a blue scarf in the air. When
asked why the photograph was his
favorite, Remington said it was “be-
cause it just happened .” Remington
said he most enjoyed the photos that
were of spontaneous movement.

Frances Dowdy began her ca-
reer in portrait photography several
years after majoring in Art History
when she enrolled in her ﬁrst pho-
tography class at the age of 40.

“Portraiture immediately
emerged as an area of special inter-

stated in her artist’s statement, has
begun “exploring the diverse nature
of dance, with more intimate por-
trait-like studies.” While many of
her photos are in black and white,
some are in a “playful pictorial
style” in color.

Like Remington, Dowdy fea-
tures students in the W&L Reper-
tory Dance Company in her pho-
tographs in this exhibit. Her work
also features professional dancers
from the Halestone Dance Studio
and the Community Dance Connec-
tion Theater.

“Each dancer brings his or her
unique experience, style and vi-
sion and our collaboration takes us
on an extraordinary photographic
journey,” said Dowdy, in her artist’s
statement.

The works of Remington and
Dowdy are captivating. Each pho-
tographer captures a wide range of
strong feeling and communicates
the passion and intense emotion of
the dancers.

“I really like the exhibit,” said
Lenfest Center work-study student
Adriana Gonzalez. “The movement
and emotion that ﬂows through the
pictures is extremely evident. I’m
glad I get to look at it every day.”

There will be an artist’s recep-
tion on Wednesday, Jan 14 from 5
p.m. to 7 p.m.

' The state of the New York Yankees

Chris Schneck pokes fun at owner George Steinbrenner and his overspending habits

By Chris Schneck
STAFF WRITER

The Yankees have been the
evil empire in sports since their
ﬁrst season in 1913. In the last
95 years the Yankees have won
a major-league leading 26 World
Series titles and 39 American
League pennants.

But the single stat that most
people cite for their dislike of
the Yankees is their payroll,
an astounding $209 million in
2008. George Steinbrenner, the
owner of the Yankees, has an
extreme desire to win that is
only matched by his seemingly
unlimited budget. In 2008, the
Yankees’ payroll was $70 mil-
lion more than next highest paid
team, the New York Mets, and
$190 million more than the low-
est paid team, the Florida ‘Mar-
lins.

But despite every resource
that money could buy, the 2008
Yankees failed to make the play-
offs. Could the Yankees organi-

zation be on the downturn?

The typical Yankee response
to losing is to spend more mon-
ey, acquiring new star players. It
would appear that was exactly
what the Yankees were doing in
the 2009 offseason.

So far the Yankees have spent
$423.5 million since the 2008
baseball season concluded. That
sum will be paid to Mark Teixei-
ra, CC Sabathia and AJ Burnett.
Sabathia split his time between
the Cleveland Indians and the
Milwaukee Brewers, which he
led to the NL Wild Card, in 2008.
Overall, he was 17-10 with an
ERA of 2.70 and 251 strikeouts,
but he was 11-2 with three com-
plete games with the Brewers.
The Yankees signed Sabathia
on Dec. 18, 2008, to a seven-
year $161 million contract, the

‘largest contract in MLB history

given out to a pitcher.

On the very same day, the
Yankees also signed free agent
pitcher AJ Burnett to a ﬁve-year,

$82.5 million deal. Burnett ﬁn-
ished the 2008 season with an
18-10 markland an American
League leading 231 strikeouts.
But the Yankees were not
done yet. On Jan. 6, 2009, Teix-
eira was introduced as a Yan-
kee. He agreed to a preliminary

going according to plan for the
Yankees. They had secured the
top free agents and had ﬁlled
their needs by spending, spend-
ing and more spending. Again,
it appears as though everything
was normal in New York, or was
it?

In 2008, the Yankees ’ payroll was $ 7 0
million more than the highest paid team,
the New York Mets, and $190 million

more than the lowest paid team, the F lor-

ida Marlins.

deal woith $180 million over 8
years. Teixeira batted .308 with
33 home runs and 121 RBI’s
in 2008. Sabathia, Burnett and
Teixeira rank ﬁrst, ﬁfth and sec-
ond respectively on mlbtraderu-
mors.com’s ranking of top free
agents in 2009.

Everything seemed to be

Actually, the Yankees are due
to spend $30 million less than
last year. After players who were
high paid and who had under
performed such as Andy Petite,
Jason Giambi and Carl Pavano
came off the books, the Yankees’
payroll was reduced by a great

' amount.

Women’s basketball beats

While it seems that the Yan-
kees are spending as much if not
more so than ever, they actually
cut payroll by 14 percent. This
payroll out came in the same
off-season that the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays, the defending AL
Champions and the Yankee’s

‘divisional rivals, increased their
payroll by 25 percent.

But it does not stop there; in
the 2009 season the Yankees are

opening the new Yankee Stadi-

um. The total cost of the project
is $l.3_billion. One would think
with the constant scllouts, a tele-
vision station, and the biggest
market in the country that the
Yankees and Steinbrenner could
foot the bill. But they couldn’t.
The Yankees are receiving
considerable help from the state
of New York in order to com-
plete the stadium on time. The
land that the stadium and park-
ing lies on belongs not to the
Yankees, but to the state; the
parking constructions will be

built and paved not by the Yan-
kees, but by the state; the city
also will issue tax-exempt bonds
for the Yankees’ new stadium. In
total, the New York state taxpay-
ers will pay $70 million to-help
the Yankees, as authorized by
the state legislature. -

Could the richest team in
baseball be in trouble? Could
overspending every year ﬁnally
be catching up with them? Could
the recent economic downturn
be hurting them too? Could the
Yankees be the sports world’s

Bernard Madoff, the genius be-_

hind a Ponzi scheme, or simply
a fraud who was pretending?
Maybe, just maybe King George
could be turning into Average
Joe. Or maybe a lot more spend-
ing is to come.

In the ODAC preseason coaches poll,
the Washington and Lee women’s bas-
ketball team was ranked ninth out of 11
teams in the conference. On Jan. 4, the
Generals beat the preseason favorite Ran-
dolph-Macon 67-66.

After a 15-point loss to Virginia Wes-
leyan on Tuesday, W&L faced off against
the preseason number two seed Lynch-
burg (LC) on Friday at the Warner Cen-
ter. The Generals upset the Hornets in
convincing fashion 94-77.

The 94 points that W&L scored on Fri-
day is the second most in the program’s
history. Back on Dec. 1 of this season,
the Generals tallied 111 points in a win
over Hollins to set the scoring record.

First-yearr guard Becca Bolton paced
W&L with a career-high 29 points and 10
rebounds for her second double-double.
Sophomore center Felice Herman, senior
guard Bethany Ridenhour and ﬁrst-year
guard Meghan Ingram joined Bolton in
double ﬁgures.

Bolton described the team’s offensive
strategy, “We did a really good job run-
ning our offense and passing the ball. We
didn’t settle for the jump shots, and we
were able to get the ball inside more.”

LC junior forward Brittany Dahn, a
regional all-star last season, led the Hor-
nets with 21 points and 11 rebounds.

The teams appeared to be fairly even
to start the game as the ﬁrst half saw
seven lead changes. An athletic squad,
the Hornets defense employed full court
pressure that startled the Generals at the
beginning of the contest. Generals coach
Mandy King called on sophomore point
guard Allie Long, and she was able to es-
cape the intense LC pressure.

W&L tumed over the ball 16 times

 

in the ﬁrst half but only seven times in
the second stanza. Despite their ﬁrst-half
turnovers, the Generals led for the major-
ity of the game. At the break, the home
team was up 41-35.

Bolton and the rest of the W&L team
were able to carry the momentum from

ing a W&L record for three-pointers in a
game. In addition, Ingram recorded six
boards, ﬁve assists, two blocks and two
takeaways.

Bolton also registered 10 points and
ﬁve rebounds. Randolph had three start-
ers ﬁnish in double ﬁgures: sophomore

“Our team is mindset going into the next couple of

games is that we know we can win if we work hard.

We beat the preseason number one [and number two

seeds], so I think everyone knows that we are going

to be able to compete with all the teams in the confer-

I

ence. ’

Becca Bolton, first-year guard

the end of the ﬁrst period into the start of
the second.

In the opening minutes after halftime,
Coach King’s club pushed its lead to dou-
ble digits.

With 7:45 remaining in the game and a
20-point W&L lead, LC coach Stephanie
Tobey became visibly frustrated with her
team and substituted reserves for all ﬁve
players on the ﬂoor, including Dahn. The
second team played for the remainder of
the game.

W&L shot an impressive 50 percent
from the ﬁeld and 91.7 percent from the
charity stripe. The 17-point Generals win
gives them the 15-14 edge in the all-time
W&L-LC series.

/ On Saturday, W&L travelled to Lynch-
burg, Va., for an away ODAC game with
Randolph. The Generals showed no let-
down after Friday’s big win and once
again came out on top, 75-58. After the
ﬁrst two minutes of the game, W&L re-
linquished its lead.

Ingram had another good game Satur-
day, scoring a game-high 26 points. She
was 10 of 13 from the ﬁeld including 6
of 9 from behind the three-point line, ty-

forward Michelle Brockman with 18, ju-
nior forward Lindsay Cross with 17 and
senior guard Sam Schaffstall with 10.
However, the Generals limited their op-
ponents to only four points off the bench
and the W&L offense proved to be too
much for the WildCat defense to handle.

The two wins this weekend put the
Generals at 4-6 on the year and 4-2 in the
ODAC, which puts them in ﬁfth place in
the conference.

Looking ahead, W&L has ﬁve straight.
upcoming ODAC games: ﬁrst up is a 7:00
p.m. showdown on Tuesday at Eastern
Mennonite, who was ranked second in
the conference as of press time Sunday.

The Generals’ recent success has giv-
en them conﬁdence going into this stretch:
of important ODAC games. Bolton said,
“Our team’s mindset going into the next
couple of games is that we know we can
win if we work hard. We beat the pre-
season number one '[and number two
seeds], so I think everyone knows that we
are going to be able to compete with all
the teams in the conference.”

Reviewing the BCS '

Tackett takes a look back at the college football season

By Lee Tackett
STAFF warren

After another virtuoso performance
by Florida all-purpose quarterback Tim
Tebow in the BCS National Championship
game, the 2008-2009 college football sea-
son has ﬁnally come to a close. Although
there were no pure upsets of the magni-
tude of last year’s opening week shocker
of Appalachian State over Michigan, this
year’s season raised new debates regard-
ing conference supremacy, the validity of
the BCS system and whether there is truly
a need for the Magic Jack St. Petersburg
bowl.

With 34 bowl games played" during
this year’s bowl season, 64 of the 120
FBS teams who met the criteria for bowl
eligibility of six wins were given the op-
portunity to participate in the post-season.
The magnitude of bowls is almost entirely
dependent on what kind of school is play-
ing in a bowl.

A traditional power like West Virginia,
who knocked off an upstart North Caro-
lina team in the Meineke Car Care‘ Bowl,
was unable to meet their individual pre-
season expectations and was able to use
the bowl game as not only a proper send
off for one of their programs most deco-
rated athletes, quarterback Pat White, but
also was able to play younger players in
an effort to evaluate talent for the follow-
ing season.

This isn’t to say that bowl wins aren’t
important to bigger schools, especially
when a ﬁrst-year coach like West Vir-
ginia’s Bill Stewart is involved, but after
huge BCS bowl win in the previous sea-
son, West Virginia has reasons to be disap-
pointed about the 2008-2009 season. The
spirit of the bowl season greatly differs,
however, for a team like Colorado State,
whose victory in the New Mexico Bowl
was the school’s ﬁrst post-season victory
since 2001. Colorado State’s victory will
not only be a large boost to recruiting for
another ﬁrst-year coach Steve Fairchild
but gives the program signiﬁcant momen-
tum moving into the 2009 season with few

- players graduating.

In the imperfect system of the Bowl
Championship Series, 2008 may have
been its most difﬁcult year in truly iden-
tifying the top two teams at season’s end.

The BCS Championship ended as a match-
up between number one ranked Big 12
champion Oklahoma, whose only blemish
was a ten-point loss to Texas in the Red
River Shootout, against the number two
ranked SEC champion Florida Gators,
who dropped a early home game to Ole
Miss after an extra point was blocked in
the game’s closing minutes.

Rankings aside, many in the media
didn’t question Florida’s position in the
national title game. After all, the Gators
play in arguably the nation’s toughest con-
ference and had just knocked off previous-

.15"
ﬁfteen teams TCU and BYU, and was
given a chance in the Sugar Bowl against
SEC runner-up Alabama. After being very
large underdogs, Utah pulled possibly the
greatest BCS upset ever and knocked off
Alabama to complete a 13-0 season.

Not to be outdone, USC, who dropped
an early season road game to Oregon State,
took the hammer to Big 10 champion
Penn State in the Rose Bowl to complete
another one-loss season that concluded in
a convincing win over a top Big 10 team.

Florida was crowned national cham-.

pion by both the AP and thevCoaches poll

system and whether there is truly a need for the magic-

' Jack St. Petersburg bowl.‘

ly undefeated Alabama in the SEC cham-
pionship game. ,Oklahoma’s position in
the game was much more contested given
that their position in the Big 12 champi-
onship game came as a notion of winning
a three-way tie in the Big 12 south with
Texas Tech and Texas.

Although Texas beat Oklahoma by ten,
they dropped a road game on the ﬁnal play
to Texas Tech. Texas Tech’s claims to be in
the Big 12 championship game as a part of
the three-way tie were essentially silenced
aﬁer a 44-point loss to Oklahoma. When
the dust settled, the ﬁnal tiebreaker for the
three teams was the highest rated team in
the ﬁnal BCS rankings, which happened
to be Oklahoma.

Although Florida defeated Oklahoma
by a score of 24 to 14, the situation was
nowhere near settled after the perfor-
mances of Utah, Texas and USC. Out of
the Mountain West Conference, Utah had
quietly amassed quite a resume through-
out the season with wins over Michigan,
Pac 10 contender Oregon state, and top

but not without loud complaints from the
coaches of USC, Texas and Utah. With
more and more controversy emerging
each year over who is the true national
champion, it will be interesting to. see how
long the NCAA can hold off from moving
towards a playoff system.

The ﬁnal story line of this season is
yet to be ﬁnished but will greatly impact
the landscape of college football for the
next year. With the top two receivers in

the nation, Jeremy Maclin of Missouri and ‘

Michael Crabtree of Texas Tech already
ﬁling their paper work for the NFL draft,
they will be the ﬁrst of a possible mass
exodus of junior skill position players to
the NFL.

With the nation’s three Heisman ﬁnal-
ists Bradford, McCoy and Tebow all being
juniors along with possibly top NFL pros-
pect USC quarterback Mark Sanchez, the
next few weeks likely have groundbreak-
ing effects on the rosters of the nation’s
top teams for the 2009 season.
