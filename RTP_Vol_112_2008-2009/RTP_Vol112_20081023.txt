Renovated Wilson
Field rededieated

Ceremony recognizes new
Hall of Fame inductees

By Jesslca Stralt
STAFF WRITER

The opening ceremony of the renovated Wil-
son Field last Saturday served as a reminder of
past successes on the old ﬁeld and the potential to
continue that tradition on the new one. ,

A large crowd of students and visiting alumni
cheered on the Generals in the Hampden-Sydney
game Saturday afternoon. At half-time, President
Ruscio and Athletic Director Jan Hathom took the
ﬁeld to ofﬁcially open the athletic complex, the
construction of which was made possible by a do-
nation from Dick Duchossis and his family.

“It is a distinction and ‘an honor to accept the
ﬁeld on the behalf of the staff, faculty, students
and alumni,” Ruscio said.

During the ceremony, four athletes and the
1961 Washington and- Lee football team were
inducted into the Hall of Fame. The inductees
include Jack Berry ’76, Andrew White ’88,,Beth
Stutzmann ’90 and Dave Warﬁeld ’75 for athletic
achievements in track and ﬁeld, lacrosse, swim-
ming and soccer.

The 1961 football team, which had a perfect
season record of 9-0, was inducted next as the 2 1 st
class into the Hall of Fame. The Touchdown Club
of Washington, D.C. named W&L’s 1961 team
“Outstanding Small College Football Team”.

“I think the ﬁeld is absolutely
gorgeous and the facilities are as
good as any in the country. It is
both aesthetically pleasing and
functional, and I am thrilled to
be a part of it. ”

Mlckey Walker ‘63, 1961 football team
 

Mickey Walker ’63, a member of the team,
came from Virginia Beach this weekend to be part
of the ceremony.

“I think the ﬁeld is absolutely gorgeous and
the facilities are as good as any in the country,”
Walker said. “It is both aesthetically pleasing and
functional, and I am thrilled to be a part of it.”

It was Walker’s ﬁrst time to step back on the
ﬁeld since playing for the team from 1959-1963.
For many members of the 1961 football team, it
was the ﬁrst time they had seen each other in over
40 years. More than half of the original team made
it back to W&L for the induction ceremony.

The team toured the renovated athletic com-
plex Saturday morning. Walker recalled how the
press box used to be set so low that the people
inside narrating and recording statistics for the
game would often not be able to see properly if
the crowd blocked the window. Walker, who also
ran track, said the new track is an improvement on
the old cinder track he used to run on.

Renovations to the ﬁeld began in October
2007. The ﬁeld features a new brick stadium that
seats 3,500 on the home side and 500 on the visi-
tors’ side, a two—story press box, an upper court
with concessions stands, chairs and tables, a syn-
thetic turf ﬁeld, an expanded track, new lighting
and a new wrought-iron gate which players run
through at the beginning of every game.

A number ll encircled on the left comer of the
playing surface honors the late Rob Lindsey, one
of the top two athletes in W&L’s history, Ruscio
said. Lindsey’s family was present at the ceremo-
ny, along with many of his former teammates and
classmates.

For many years, the rusting, metal bleachers
where football fans used to sit drew complaints
for not matching the aesthetic appeal of the rest of
the campus. Now, Wilson Field is the latest gem
to adorn W&L.

“I feel like it has deﬁnitely strengthened school
spirit,” senior Chris Tutor said. “I think people are
proud of it, and I really like how it blends in with
our campus. The old ﬁeld was somewhat of an
eyesore.”

The renovations have also affected the way
players feel about their football games.

“Playing on Wilson ﬁeld has always been fun
but now there is even more pride to play well and
be a General,” junior Jeffrey Boateng said.

The transformation of Wilson Field should
“beneﬁt the Washington & Lee community for
many years to come,” Hathom said.

Gossip Girl

Juicycampus.com makes gossiping even easier at W&L

By Queenie Wong
STAFF WRITER

A controversial campus gossip
Web site has Washington and Lee
students dishing the dirt about their
peers anonymously online.

Called Juicy Campus, it’s a col-
legiate version of a cyber bathroom
wall where users can post anonymous
comments about students in 500 col-
leges nationwide. Students here be-
gan posting on the website last month
and popular topics include “hottest
girl in each srat,” “worst hazers” and
“most beautiful penis.”

It’s the latest online craze to hit
college campuses, but some critics
say the online tattling goes too far.

“I was angry at ﬁrst, but now I
have come to accept that our campus
deﬁnitely talks the talk but doesn’t
walk the walk when it comes to hon-
or and integrity,” said a W&L stu-
dent, who discovered she had been
gossiped about on the site.

“I am more aware of what the stu-

dent body is truly like and I am less
trusting of my peers,” she said.
Student body organizations
quickly responded to the site by
sending a mass e-mail to the campus
community. They called Juicy Cam-

“I have come to accept
that our campus...talks
the talk but doesn ’t walk
the walk when it comes

to honor and integrity. ”

A W&L student who was
referenced on Julcycampus.

pus “inconsistent” with the school’s
honor code and community values
and reminded students to respect and
honor others.

“For our part, we advocate only
what is expected of every W&L stu-

dent: respectful, honorable conduct
toward your peers and the members
of this community,” said the c-mail.

The e-mail was signed by the
student heads of the Executive
Council, the Student Judicial Coun-
cil, Resident Advisers, the Student-
Faculty Hearing Board, the Panhel-
lenic Council and the Interfraternity
Council.

The Dean of Student Affairs,
Dawn Watkins, said she immediately
contacted the Executive Committee
after she began receiving student e-
mails complaining about the site.
Although some colleges have looked
into blocking Juicy Campus, Watkins
said the best solution is in the hands
of the students.

“I saw our student leadership re-
spond in a powerful way and I saw
our student body rise to that level,”
she said. “This was student self-gov-
emance at its best.”

Other students agree that the site
is harmful.

“I think the anonymity of it pro-

vides students an opportunity to say
things they normally wouldn’t say
and that probably has a detrimental
effect on social life at this school,”
said junior Ben Goetsch.

Sophomore Austin Bone called the
site “juvenile and seventh-grade.”

But for those who have been de-
famed on sites like Juicy Campus
there is little they can do, said jour-
nalism professor, Adedayo Abah.

Abah, who teaches a course on
communications law, referred to the
Communications Decency Act of
1996. The Act pr0teets,Web publish-
ers from liability for libelous com-
ments posted by third parties.

Yet protection of anonymous
speech is hardly new, Abah said.

“Anonymous speech was pro-
tected prior to the popularity of the
Internet to protect speakers against
the tyranny of the majority,” she
said. “However, in the online world,
anonymous speech has become a
guise for some speakers to smear
other people.”

The fourth presidential debate

College Democrats, Republicans hola’ mock debate in Lee Chapel

By Anne Vesoulls
STA F F W R I T E R

As presidential candidates Barack
Obama and John McCain duke it out
in the national media, students at
Washington and Lee are carrying on
the debate on campus.

Politically-minded students gath-
ered in Lee Chapel .on Tuesday,
Oct. 18, to observe and participate
in a mock presidential debate be-
tween representatives of the College
Democrats and College Republicans.
Politics Prof. Bill Connely presided
over the debate.

Both organizations came to the
debate ready to defend their candi-
date and attack the other side on six
areas, including the economy and
taxes, national security, energy and
the environment, healthcare, domes-
tic and social issues and character.

“We researched Barack Obama’s
position on the various issues, brain-
stormed what the College Republi-
cans might attack about it and tried
to come up with counter punches,”
said College Democrats debater
Summer Lollie.

“To prepare, [we] got together
and brainstormed,” said College Re-
publicans President Scott Centorino.
“We practiced, our answers and fol-
low-ups to the expected Democratic
answers and attacks. We knew the
Democrats would come out swinging
and that the only way to beat them
would be to ﬁght back aggressively
and keep them on the defensive.”

The questions were negotiated by
the participants prior to the debate.

Each response was to last one minute ‘

and the opposing side had a one min-
ute rebuttal. Participants were per-
mitted to call for a second rebuttal.

The College Democrats presented
Barack Obama as a man who was
for the middle class with relation to
the economy, the environment and
healthcare while accusing McCain
of being too “big business.”

“The United States should oper-
ate under a ‘Pay-Go’ system like the
rest of the middle class. If we don’t
have the money, we can’t spend it,”
said College Democrats debater Jor-
dan Wilson.

The College Republicans focused

on John McCain as an American
hero with war experience, senatorial
experience and the best interest of
America at heart.

“One candidate has rhetoric; the
other has substance behind his words.
One candidate has slogans, the other
has solutions...One pledges to ﬁght
for some Americans. The other has
already fought for all Americans...
The people of America know John
McCain,” Centorino said; _

Reactions to the mock debate
were mixed.

“Overall the debate was a suc-
cess,” said ﬁrst-year Robert Day.
“The College Democrats and College
Republicans faced off, and generally
supported their party lines .”

“As a strong Obama supporter,
this was the ﬁrst debate of this elec-
tion season I’ ve seen the Republicans
win. Each side had strong and weak
arguments and plenty of ideas, but I
believe the ideas articulated by the
Republicans put the Democrats on
the defensive throughout,” he said.

‘‘I thought the debate was interest-
ing to watch,” said ﬁrst-year Joshua

Posner. “The Democrats and Repub-
licans both appeared strong, but the
Republicans tried to act like they
knew everything_ while the Demo-
crats seemed overly nervous.”

“I don’t think anyone ‘actually
won the debate because no one re-
ally took their opponents point and
accurately criticized it or came up
with a reason their idea was better,”
he said.

Participants on both sides main-
tained their side had won the debate.

“I think the debate was more sub-
stantiate than the real Presidential
and Vice Presidential debates,” Lol-
lie said. “We got to the key issues
and actually debated policy. As far as
the outcome, in my opinion, there is
no doubt that the Democrats won.”

“I really enjoyed the debate,” se-
nior Chris Tutor said . “I thought the
discussion was fascinating and I felt
like I learned a bit. It was very con-
structive and I am happy that I had
the opportunity to participate. Not
surprisingly I think the Republicans
won, and I think the audience would
agree.”

The Virtue of
being cheap

Personal ﬁnance columnist
says America is a nation of
debt-lovers and credit is evil

By Alllson chopln
MANAGING EDITOR

Credit is evil and frugality is the only path to ﬁnan-
cial freedom and a blissful life -- at least, that’s the view
taken by Michelle Singletary, personal ﬁnance columnist

for the Washington Post who spoke in W&L’s Stackhouse ‘

Theater last Tuesday..

Singletary said her message not only holds true for
personal ﬁnance, but also explains the causes of the cur-
rent ﬁnancial crisis, which she described as “credit, con-
sumerism and contentment, or lack thereof.”

“We are a nation of debt-lovers,” she said. lel House, a $4 million project make an ‘“"°S““‘_"“ 1“ What “"11 I_8 1

ing because they eliminate the feeling of actually paying third Of the remaining fui1dii1g- There are many needs and S qll are

for purchases.

“Write that down: credit is evil,” she told her audi-
ence.

Singletary also accused the culture of consumerism
that encourages unhealthy spending habits, such as un-
necessary purchases, the reliance on credit and debit cards
and the attitude that bargain shopping saves money.

“You never save when you spend,” she said.

Singletary said she learned her frugal habits from a
grandmother who raised her and her siblings, and it is
this ﬁnance-savvy lifestyle that protects her from worry-
ing about the current crisis. ‘

“l’ve lived a frugal life,” she said. “I’m cheap. 1 breast-
fed my three children because the milk was free.”

In advising the audience on how to live with ﬁnancial
security, she said that putting everything into saving ac-
counts or cash is not the way to go.

But people should not rely entirely on investment
portfolios either. Singletary told her audience that they
should “diversify” where they put their money, making
sure to keep some cash on hand while putting the rest in
a variety of stocks and bonds.

Her advice changes for different age groups. For ex-
ample, she suggested that workers in their twenties have
90 percent of their money in stocks, but from age 60 and
above, this amount should be 50 percent

She emphasized that easy credit, which until recently
prevailed in borrowing and lending, is the cause of the
economic crisis, not its solution.

“You want to know how to weather this crisis?” she
asked. “Do the opposite of what everybody else is do-

Investors should also educate themselves about how
markets perform over time so they can make the best de-
cisions, said Singletary. They need to be prepared, since
the current bail-out plans for the economy are “only a
temporary Band-Aid.”

“[The crisis] is going to happen again,” she said. “Are
you going to learn from what is happening now?”

Singletary’s most ardent advice was to save money
and spend it wisely when necessary. ~

“My husband and I probably live on 30 percent of
our income,” she said. “You have to live below your
means.”

J. Donald Childress gives $5 million

Grant will fund two professorships and jumpstart the $4 million Hillel House

By Brett Holton
COPY EDITOR

Washington and Lee received
a $5 million grant last week that
will create new teaching posts
and help further the University’s
forthcoming capital campaign.

J. Donald Childress, rector of
W&L’s Board of Trustees, is al-
locating $2.5 million of his gift to
create the J. Donald Childress Pro-
fessorship in Foreign Languages
and the Sidney Gause Childress
Professorship in the Arts.

Another $500,000 of the gift
is being used to jump start a chal-
lenge fund for the new W&L Hil-

Two million dollars of Chil-
dress’ gift remains to be desig-
nated.

According to the W&L web-
site, the Childress Professorship in
Foreign Languages will “support

a distinguished professor who is
both an accomplished scholar and
an exceptional teacher in one of
the foreign languages, preferably
Spanish.” This is the ﬁrst time a
professorship has been offered for
a foreign language.

‘The Sydney Gause Childress
Professorship in the Arts is named
for Childress’ wife, and will sup-
port a professor in the performing
or visual arts department. Pref-
erence is given to art or art his-
tory. This also represents the ﬁrst
professorship exclusively for the
arts.

“l was pleased to be able to

many opportunities in our educa-
tional priorities, which stem from
the strategic plan. There are many
aspects of this plan, and they all
cost money. I thought it was my
obligation as an alumnus and as a
trustee to step up with this gift.”

Wachovia freezes short-term fund
W&L gets 40 percent of $1 .5 million while 60 percent remains frozen

By Jacob Gelger
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee was one of
hundreds of universities that got a
nasty shock on Sept. 29 when Wa-
chovia decided to freeze the Com-
monfund Short Term Fund.

W&L had $1.5 million frozen
in the fund, about six percent of
the $25 million in cash W&L usu-
ally has available during a ﬁscal
year.

Since the freeze, W&L has been
able to get about 40 percent of the
cash back, said Steven McAllister,
the university treasurer and vice
president for ﬁnance and admin-
istration. But he and Controller
Deborah Caylor are closely watch-
ing other cash investments worth
$8.6 million.

“We still think the actual as-
set is good,” McAllister said. “We
just may not be able to get it right
away.” '

Commonfund is a Connecti-
cut-based non-proﬁt that handles
money for nearly 1,000 colleges,
including 72 of the 100 largest en-
dowments. The Short Term Fund
was a hugely popular fund de-
signed to let colleges and universi-
ties invest cash for several months

at a time, then withdraw that cash
whenever the school needed the
cash for paychecks, debt payments
or other expenses. Nearly 1,000
colleges were members, and just
weeks before the freeze the fund
was worth $9.3 billion.

Colleges usually get most of
their cash at the start of each se-
mester, when tuition is due. But
expenses trickle in on a monthly
basis as the school pays employ-
ees, vendors and bills. That means
the pile of tuition cash sits around
for months on end.

To make sure that money didn’t
go to waste, schools started invest-
ing in supposedly ultra-safe ac-
counts like the Short Term Fund.
The school could put in large
amounts of cash and then with-
draw whatever cash it needed on
the ﬁrst day of each month.

That was the theory, at least.

The funds ran into trouble af-
ter buying mortgage-backed se-
curities and corporate debt. When
Lehman Brothers collapsed and

-AIG was nationalized on Sept. 15,

commercial credit markets froze
up and those securities became
virtually worthless. The plunge
in value occurred because inves-

tors were only interested in buying
extremely safe government debt,
Bloomberg News said.

Wachovia’s decision to freeze
the fund and give members access
to only 10 percent of their invest-
ments left some schools scram-
bling to make payroll or pay the
electricity bill.

_McAllister said the crisis was
never that serious at W&L. He said
the school has enough cash on hand
to continue operations through the
end of the school year, even if the
$8.6 million in other troubled in-
vestments remains frozen. That
seven month cash cushion leaves
W&L in far better shape than most
schools, he said.

As McAllister has kept an eye
on W&L’s cash holdings, he’s also
been watching the value of the
university’s endowment rise and
fall with the stock market. He said
the last quarter didn’t treat many
endowments well. W&L’s endow-
ment, worth $719 million on June
30, was probably worth about $660
million on Sept. 30.

“My sense, from what l’ve seen
and the reports l’ve gotten, is that
we’ll be down about 10 percent,”
McAllister said. “That will be sim-

The treasurer said one of W&L’s
fund managers reported that every
major index and asset class lost
value in the last quarter, meaning
there were no good‘ places to put

-money. The university. did ﬁnish

the last ﬁscal year, which ended
June 30, with a positive return on
the endowment. McAllister said
that was a distinction not many
universities could claim.

One key role of the endowment
is to provide leverage and collat-
eral for the school when it takes on
major debt for building projects.
Even though major renovations
on Newcomb Hall will begin next
year with renovations of the other
Colonnade buildings to follow,
McAllister said W&L wasn’t cur-
rently looking to take on any new
debt.

“The goal for the Colonnade is
for it to be fully fund-raised, and
theearliest we’d have to look at
borrowing money to start work
while the pledges came in would
be summer 2009,” he said. “I think
we’rc in a good position on that
and have ﬂexibility because of our
ﬁnancial strength.”

Why I’m Voting for...

Senator Barack Obama (D — Illinios) and Senator Joe Biden (D, - Connecticut).

By Cody Beauchamp
OPINIONS EDITOR

A little over a week ago, I ﬁlled
out an absentee ballot and mailed
it on home to Texas.

You’d think that, as a Texan,
I voted for John McCain. Or,
depending on how you look at
things, against Barack Obama.

I didn’t. I voted for Barack.

If you’re willing to keep read-
ing, I’d like a few minutes to try
to convince you to join me. Why
not, anyway‘? It’s Parents Week-
end, and you likely need a break
from the packed schedule any-
way. <

I want you to know, ﬁrst of all,
that ifl could’ve voted in 2000, I
would have voted for Bush. I’m
not a lifelong partisan, “yellow-
dog” Democrat.

I’m persuadable and moderate,
I really am.

I actually had to think about
who I was voting for, in other
words.

When I did think about who to
vote for, a few things struck me.

The ﬁrst is how absolutely
trivial a lot of the normal criteria
for deciding who to vote for have
become. l~or this election cycle at
least, I simply do not believe that
there’s much disagreement about
what the issues are, and (gener-
ally) what we need to do about
them.

Both Obama and McCain
agree the economy is priority
number one. Both candidates now
agree that the economy needs to
be ﬁxed. Let’s take care of good
01’ Joe the Plumber.

The two also agree on Iraq,
more or less. Both agree we need
to leave, and to do so honorably
and intelligently. Yes, I can admit

-lomatic, sane one.

Obarna’s opposition to the surge
is troubling. But I can also admit
McCain’s support of the 2003 in-
vasion is equally ~ if not more -
troubling. It’s a tie, in my book.

So what did I base my vote
on? ,

Simply — temperament.

Our last President has a tragi-
cally un-presidential tempera-
ment. He showed time and again
he was incapable of making rea-
soned, calculated, thought-out
decisions. He ignored facts and
expert analysis in his formulation
of long term goals and plans. Too
often, W. acted like the cowboy he
wants to be, and to tragic effect.

It’s not that George W. Bush
is stupid or evil — it’s just that his
‘shoot from the hip’ tendencies
caused him to behave stupidly
and evilly. He always opted for
the bold ‘meet me at sundown’
gesture over the reasoned, dip-
We cannot
afford even four more years of
such a temperament in the White
House.

Examine the_two candidates
~ which one would you trust to be
the calm voice of reason in a cri-
sis? To beat an old talking point
to death - who do you want an-
swering a phone to bad news at 3
a.m.?

McCain favors the bold, often
ill-advised gesture. He’s a mav-
erick, yes, but that’s not always
to his credit. During the recent
bailout legislative battle Sen-
ate leadership on both sides of
the aisle told both McCain and
Obama they shouldn’t come back
to Washington.

The reality was that the me-
dia circus that now follows both
candidates would throw a danger-
ously bright spotlight on delicate

legislative negotiations.

Neither would be of much
help either, so they needed to stay
away and let their still-working
peers work (make no mistake,
neither McCain nor Obama has
been much of a legislator for the
past 6 months). _

McCain returned, against good
advice. He claimed he had helped
push the bailout -bill through. A
few days later, Republicans in the
House voted it down.

Thanks Mac.

Another contrast comes when
you examine the two men’s Veep
picks.

Obama showed a lot of humil-
ity in his pick. He proved he un-
derstood his weakness was in for-
eign affairs by picking Joe Biden,
perhaps one of the most experi-
enced Senators ever in that area.

McCain ~ rather — went for
the grand stunt. After spending
months knocking Obama for a
lack of experience, he picked the
least experienced running mate
seen on a national ticket in de-
cades.

It showed not only an inability
to reconcile his actions with his
statements — when precisely, Sen-
ator, did you quit thinking expe-
rience was stillimportant? — but
also a troubling inability to fore-
see the fallout of his decisions.

Running on a platform of ex-
perience ﬁrst, for the morally
conservative party, in a political
climate sick of a scandal-plagued
administration, McCain picked

"an inexperienced mother of an

unwed, pregnant teenager, who
would also soon be facing an in-
dependent investigation for abuse
of power.

I don’t want a man with those
kind of reasoning capabilities

anywhere near nuclear launch
codes.

The cruxes of my argument
are these.

If you want to base your vote
on the policy differences between
the two men, be my giest. Pun-
dits of either political ideology
freely admit the differences are
few and minute this election.

If you — like me — feel that you
must base your vote on character
in the absence of a deﬁning policy
clash, please vote for Obama.

John McCain is surely, abso-
lutely, and unquestionably a hero,
a great public servant, and a good
man.

But this does not mean he has
the temperament to lead our coun-
try. I

In today’s fragile economic,
diplomatic, and social environ-
ment, reason and calculated ac-
tion need to return. Obama has
been nothing but a cool, calm,
and collected hand throughout his
campaign.

He has never once veered from
his campaign’s clearly established
long term plans in favor of a bold
gesture.

In part, he has never needed
to. That tells us something about
the type of government he would

‘lead.

Our country will reward John
McCain one day by placing him
in Washington, make no mistake.

But for the sake of our country,
we must place him there in statu-
ary, as a marble bust commemo-
rating, his public service, not as
our 44“‘ President.

Please vote for Barack Obama.
Because we need change, yes, not
errant and dangerous stunts.

...Senator John McCain (R -

By Abel Delgado
COLU M NIST

If you look beyond all the talk about “change”
and “experience,” if you ignore pundits, if you
realize that Barack Obama and John McCain are
closer in political philosophy than most oppos-
ing politicians in other countries, your choice
this election comes down to one factor: trust.

Granted, I agree with Senator McCain on the
most important issues of our times much more
than I agree with Senator Obama, but even if I
agreed with them equally, I would adamantly
support McCain because I trust him more than I
can possibly trust Obama.

I cannot trust a man to ﬁx my little brother’s
education system when he sends his own chil-
dren to private school and refuses to give that
opportunity to poorer but highly motivated stu-
dents.

I trust a man who calls education the “civil
rights issue of our time” and promotes competi-
tion and higher teacher pay as a way to give my
brother a better education and my sister a better
salary.

I cannot trust a man to bring about peace
when he has already said he would bomb one
of our most crucial democratic allies. I cannot
trust him to win the war in Iraq when he is more
concerned with placing blame and hasn’t even
acknowledged the succeeding strategy he once
opposed. -

I trust a man to work for peace when he
knows the horrors of war and has two very per-
sonal reasons not to send our troops into unnec-
essary wars. I trust a man who was one of the
ﬁrst to point out the error of our strategy in Iraq
and spent years rallying his party and his country
to ﬁx them.

I cannot trust a man to solve our impending
energy crisis when he supports corn ethanol that
scientists have proved is ineﬂicient and environ-
mentally problematic while opposing nuclear en-
ergy that can legitimately help solve our energy
crisis and not worsen gt obal climate change.

I trust a man to solve our energy crisis when
his Lexington Project involves all forms of alter-
native energy while using our nation’s resources

Arizona) and Governor

wisely.
I cannot trust a man to be bi-partisan when his
greatest claim of crossing party lines is an anti-

proliferation bill that had the unanimous support _

of his party.

I trust a man to be bi-partisan when he has
co—sponsored more bills with the opposing party
than his own the past 4 years and has made a
career out of crossing party lines to address ev-
erything from climate change, to torture, to cam-
paign ﬁnance reform.

I cannot trust a man to lower my taxes when
he has voted to raise them far more times than
he’s voted to lower them. I cannot trust a man
to lead America’s free market when his policies
are protectionist in nature and far too similar to
democratic socialism.

I can trust a man to keep my taxes low and
cut taxes where he responsibly can when he has
voted to do both his entire career. I can trust a
man to lead America’s free market when at the
heart of his ideals is his faith in the market.

I cannot trust a man to battle corruption when
a convicted felon helped buy his house and he
has raised and spent more money on his cam-
paign than anyone in the history of American
politics. '

_ I can trust a man who has battled corruption
in his own party in Congress for decades and has
fought to lessen the inﬂuence special interest
money has in politics. I .

I cannot trust a man to lead my country when
he has never led anything.

Despite his wonderful eloquence and his in-
spiring story, Barack Obama has done absolutely
nothing to cam my trust. Whether he wins or
not, I hope I am wrong about him. I hope he is
everything his supporters say he is and more, but
I cannot vote on hope alone.

I do not just trust John McCain more than I
trust Barack Obama, I trust him more than any
American alive to lead our country. John Mc-
Cain was not just given the titles of hero, reform-
er, centrist, maverick, and leader. He has earned
them.

This is why Senator McCain has earned my
admiration, my trust, and my vote for president.

Time for W&L to invest in students

Washington and Lee cannot raise tuition and expect to Stay a liberal arts school

By Jacob Geiger
COLU M NIST

As parents arrive on campus
this weekend, some of them may
be pondering a frightening ques-
tion: Can I still afford to send my
child to Washington and Lee?

Most parents have probably
watched investment portfolios ~
whether they’re retirement plans,
college funds for a younger sib-
ling or savings for a new car ~
plummet in value during the past
year. Now there are signs across
the nation that many parents and
students are reevaluating the col-
lege payment plans that seemed
solid six months ago.

President Ken Ruscio said
protecting next year’s ﬁnancial
aid budget will be a high priority
as the school decides whether or

not it needs to trim back expens-
es. He also said the university is
prepared to handle increased de-
mand for ﬁnancial aid.

It’sno secret that the cost of
a W&L education has advanced
at a numbing pace in the last de-
cade.

Ten years ago, the univer-
sity was ﬁnally forced to pay
for years of holding tuition at
levels much lower than our com-
petitors. That’s led to a decade
of cost increases that averaged
about 8 percent a year. Despite
these massive increases, W&L
has only caught up in cost with
other liberal arts schools in the
past two years.

The school has made some
dramatic moves to improve ﬁ-
nancial aid, and by fall 2012,

the Johnson Scholarship will
be paying for 10 percent of the
student body. Other merit- and
need-based programs help out
even more students. The Johnson
donation has also allowed W&L
to convert many loan deals with
students into outright grants.

But students here and around
the country are still piling up
huge amounts of debt each year.

The New York Times report-
ed last week that many private
lenders have tightened credit
standards and raised interest
rates in the last month.

That means students will owe
more money down the road when
these loans come due. And with
W&L’s annual cost approaching
$50,000, an already heavy debt
load could get even worse.

As private lenders cut back,
more students nationwide are
turning to the federal govem-
ment, which handles about three-
quarters of student borrowing.
Loan applications for this year
are already up to 13.5 million, an
almost 10 percent increase from
the 12.3 million applications last
year.

The biggest problem with
student debt is that leaves many
students feeling trapped. If you
know you’re going to graduate
with $100,000 in debt, taking
that teaching job you’ve always
wanted suddenly become a bit
less appealing.

Ivy League schools have
been dealing with this problem
for years, as students feel they
need to earn big salaries to jus-

tify the amazing bills that their
parents — and student loans
— helped cover.

I’d hate to see that happen
at W&L, where our emphasis
on liberal arts has always led
students into aiwide variety of
careers.

So what can W&L do? I
doubt we’ll see a drop in tuition,
though that would certainly be
nice. Even when the school year
_shrinks by two weeks next year,
I doubt many expenses will go
down. But the university could
make an important gesture by
pledging to leave tuition un-
changed for one year.

Still, that’s unlikely to hap-
pen. One problem is W&L’s
endowment, which has been
buffeted by the market chaos.

Steven McAllister, the univer-
sity’s treasurer, said the endow-
ment lost about 10 percent of its
value in the 3rd quarter.

And with the endowment
down and donations under pres-
sure from the poor economy (if
alumni make less money, they
have less to donate), the ﬁnancial
aid office may be hard-pressed
to ﬁll the gap when families sud-
denly discover they’re short on
money.

W&L works hard to make
this school affordable. But be-
fore the school can worry about
taking care of the Class of 2013,
it may need to spend some cash
on the students who are already
here.

You weren’t raised to act like that

 

 er to the editor

Time for a serious talk

Are W&L is gender relations discussions flawed?

The members of KEWL (Knowledge
Empowering Women Leaders) would like
to inform the W&L community of the June
27, 2008 report compiled by the President’s
Committee on Women regarding the.condi-
tions of women faculty and staff at Wash-
ington and Lee.

The committee, which consisted of both
men and women faculty and staff, met from
February 2007 through May 2008, and so-
licited the expertise of an outside task force
to evaluate and make recommendations for
the climate at Washington and Lee as it per-
tains to women faculty and staff. Initially
due in March, the Committee requested
an extension from President Ruscio and
delivered their ﬁndings over the summer,
largely unbeknownst to the W&L commu-
nity. Through surveys and interviews with
faculty and staff, the committee concluded
in its report that “[m]any women on this
campus do not feel valued, respected, fairly
compensated, empowered, or even safe.”

To quote the Committee’s report:

Disturbing anecdotal evidence of gender
inequities abound, including but not limited
to the following:

I) holding women workers to a higher
standard than their male counterparts,

2) promoting a man when a woman has
more experience,

3) regularly holding managers’ meetings
without the woman manager being present,

4) paying the man who replaces a wom-
an more than the woman was paid.

The report goes on to state that “[t]here
are still academic departments where fac-
ulty and staff are not even close to the na-
tional percentage of women. Women report
that they have felt silenced when they have
tried to point out a number of issues dealing
with climate.”

Lesley Wheeler, Chair of the English
Department, writes “I am very pleased that
various staff inequities will be remedied,
especially salaries for administrative assis-
tants. However, the excellent report by the
President’s Committee on Women rightly
uses the words ‘discrimination’ and ‘harass-
ment,’ but President Ruscio’s October 8th
‘Letter to the W&L University Community’
pointedly does not. I am disappointed that
the President has not fully acknowledged
the extent of the problem. Even in faculty
meetings woman administrators and faculty
members are often cut off, belittled, or in-
appropriately touched; such bad behavior
is condoned here and known offenders are
allowed to continue in positions of author-
ity.”

While KEWL commends the Universi-
ty’s initiative to create a supportive environ-
ment for its faculty and staff, the relatively
secretive distribution of the report and its
ﬁndings is disappointing. We write this let-
ter not out of spite, but out of support for
the repo1t’s recommendation that change
A ought to occur in an “open” and “transpar-
ent” manner. We do, however, take issue
with both the questionable exclusion of
Women’s and Gender Studies faculty from
the President’s Committee on Women, and
the decision to ignore the climate women

students face at W&L.

The Committee itself notes that “[w]hile
several committee members felt that the
charge should be extended to include stu-
dents, the report was limited to the scope of
the faculty and staff...’Recent events asso-
ciated with derogatory comments towards
women students in a campus newspaper are
but the latest example of how the climate
among the students affects the everyday life
of the University. We as an entire commu-
nity are all concerned about actions taken
against our women students, and it is coun-
terproductive to think we can work on the
climate for only one group of women and
make a lasting change in our community.
Thus, we concluded that many of the cli-
mate issues related to gender must be looked
at and addressed in an holistic manner.”

KEWL hopes to see that any further steps
taken by the Committee on Women orany
like group includes the broader campus com-
munity, notably the student body. According
to ITS Director and Committee member Ju-
lie Knudson, “I believe that any committee
charged with improving the campus climate
cannot go forward without students and also
logically must include the Program Head of
Women’s Studies.” Following last year’s
divisive bracket, it is contrary to all reason
that the student body would be exempt from
a comprehensive study. Since W&L’s inte-
gration of women on campus in 1985, the
university has achieved equal numbers of
men and women students, yet as the report
explicitly states, equality and harmony of
the sexes is still something to be desired.

The report cites many of the issues fac-
ing our institution as “community” and
“climate” issues, rather than exclusively
women’s issues. The "Committee recom-
mends that “[i]n any effort at changing the
climate, the University must realize that the
problems that exist are often not restricted
to women staff and faculty or even just to
women.” The visiting team echoed the com-
mittee_’s feelings, reporting that they also
felt that it would be “prudent and effective
to broaden the topic of women’s issues to
issues of diversity in general or community
building.”

“It seemed appropriate to us to include
issues relating to students and gender rela-
tions between male and female students in
the campus discussion,” they said, accord-
ing to the Committee’s report. “Our general
feeling is that any steps or actions that help
one marginalized group tend to help every-
one who may be marginalized.”

KEWL strongly believes the ﬁndings of
this report to be the responsibility of every
student and faculty member, not limited to
the women of this community, to be aware
and proactive about the issues facing our
institution.

“I would just like to be a good teacher,
writer, and member of this community--to
do my work well--and that is inordinately
difficult in this climate,” Wheeler writes.

Parents Weekend should remind us of our potential for civility

‘By Crlghton Allen
C 0 LU M N I ST

Hiya Hiya Hiya. Is everyone
having a good semester? Mine’s
been great, but I am ready to get
my parents up here. A nice South-

ern Inn brunch, a set of fresh sheets -

on my bed, clean clothes, I’ve been
yearning for all those and more
since my parents dropped me off to
start the year.

It’ll be nice to have all those
things again, even if it’s just for
a weekend. (I’m just joking; of
course I’ve had Southern Inn since
my parents left. I’m not totally
helpless up here alone.)

Clean boxers and ﬁlet mignon
aside, I think we would all be bet-
ter off if we had our parents up here
more often. And I’m not talking
about just physically, either.

Too often, I feel, when our par-
ents drop us off for our four years
here at W&L, we see it as four years
apart not only physically but also as
the ﬁrst real chance to break away
from the yoke of rules and expecta-
tions we felt at home.

At home, we have to be well be-
haved, mannerly, responsible, and
accountable, but at college, not so
much. H

If I stayed out until 2 a.m on a
random Wednesday night back in
high school, there would be three
words to describe my immediate
future: Georgia Military Academy.
But here, I and anyone else can do
it and Momma never has to know
you ever left the library.

College is designed to foster an
intellectual and social maturation in
an environment unlike the one from
home. How else, then, could one be
expected to learn and grow past the
person you were in high school?

Although you may be taken out
of your home, don’t let your home
be taken out of you. Because you
know what occurs when you let that
happen: arrests, poor grades, prob-
lems with alcohol and other drugs,
the list can go on ad nauseum.

I will bet you that none of the
things that befall students here
were as much of a problem in high
school.

If you failed classes in high
school, or got arrested, or struggled
with alcohol, odds are quite good
you wouldn’t be here now. And I
think that is so because each of us
here had an amazing support sys-
tem of parents, family, friends, and
teachers who loved and supported
us and urged us to ﬁnd and utilize
the best parts of ourselves.

Now that we ﬁnd ourselves here,
far away from those nurturing net-
works, let us not forget those who
encouraged us and loved us and
sacriﬁced on our behaves to get us
here to our university today.

Forget not the lessons that they
taught you back home that made
you want to attend W&L and made
W&L want you to attend equally as
much. For W&L would not have
accepted any of us, not a solitary
one, if it did not sense that we came
from a background that fostered a
person capable of living the life of
honor that our school requires of all
its students.

The social pressures here to be
someone different than who we
really are manifest themselves tre-.
mendously every day.

I know I have given into those
pressures more times than I wish to
count. Yet, every time I stumble on
my walk to be the person my par-
ents raised me to be, I pick myself
back up, for I know that the sup-

port they gave, and continue to give
me, is stronger than anything I can
ﬁnd here that would seek to pull me
down.

Freshmen, I am talking to you
here.

This year will be the most trans-
formative year of your life; just
make sure that what you learn about
yourself is more along the lines of
discovering your hidden love for
cognitive psychology rather than
your skill with bourbon pulls.

Do not forget who you are and
where you came from. ’

Your parents raised you to be
better than a lot of what goes on
here after dark. You know it, too.

As long I am being sappy here, I
can be cliché too. Polonius, no great
man himself, but a loving father
nonetheless, told his son Laertes in
Shakespeare’s Hamlet: “To thine
own self be true,.and it must follow,
as the night the.day, thou canst not
then be false to any man.”

His words strike a powerful cord
then and now. The best version of
yourself is the person you truly are.
If you want to be liked, drop your
front and be yourself.

So parents, welcome to Wash-
ington & Lee this weekend.

You are sending us, your chil-
dren, to a school that offers us every
advantage -in the world. But if not
for you and your love and support
of us, we would be far, far away
from where we stand today, proud,
accomplished students of one of the
nation’s ﬁnest schools.

In all we say and do here, though
it may indeed be great, we are go-
ing to rely on you all to keep us
grounded, to keep us humble, and
to keep us mindful always of who
we really are.

“Forbidden Broadway ” and
student talent blend ﬂawlessly

By Flndley Merritt
STAFF WRITER

Part Broadway revue, part satire, and all
student talent, the Student Showcase was an
excellent display of Washington and Lee’s
diverse array of theatrical skills.

Members of the Washington and Lee
Theater department and Mindbending, a
student directing group, treated audiences
to the 2008 Student Showcase with “For-
bidden Broadway” this past weekend. The
show ran from October 17 through the 19 at
the Johnson Theatre in Lenfest Hall.

Written by Gerard Alessandrini and di-
rected by Marquita Robinson, the perfor-
mance was a Broadway parody interspersed
with student talent. “Forbidden Broadway”
was a revue that spoofed show tunes, char-
acters and plots of contemporary and cur-
rent Broadway musicals, and targeted well
known American lyrists.

Broadway classics such as “Annie,”
“Into the Woods,” “Hello Dolly,” “Les
Miserables,” “Rent,” “Mamrna Mia “and
“Wicked” were among the satirized group,
not to mention a few others.

The play opened with a spoof on “An-
nie,” in which Annie had been reduced to an
unemployed, chain-smoking thirty-year-old
hoping that someone would “revive” her.

The performance ended with a spoof on
“A Chorus Line” in which the actors urged
audiences to “Kiss Cliches Goodbye.” In
between, the show poked fun about the
excessive length of shows, especially “Les
Miserables.”

With songs like “Somewhat Overindul-
gent,” “Call on Carol,” and “The Phantom
and Ethel: The Mucus of the Night,” the
play attacked iconic Broadway ﬁgures like

’ Mandy Patinkin, Carol Channing, and Ethel

Merrnan. It also spoofed major theatre top-
ics such as the confusion between Chita Ri-
vera and Rita Moreno, and the difﬁculty of
Sondheim’s lyrics.

Apart from “Forbidden Broadway,” the
2008 Showcase featured plenty of other
W&L student talent. There were eight show-
case numbers ranging from monologues,
musical performances, skits, and dance per-
formances.

Some work was original, in that the per-
formers had written their own monologues
and choreographed their own dance pieces.

Others covered well known work and

sometimes added their own interpretation.

The covered work included a musical
performance of Guns N Roses’ “Don’t Cry,”
“Thoroughly Modern Millie’s” “Gimme
Gimme,” a dance performance titled “Reth-
gio de Amor,” and “What Is This Feeling”
from “Wicked” “Lexington Gay Bar” was
a sketch based on The Ice Cream Socialists’
“Gar Bar,” in which students added their
own interpretation to the original content.

Overall, the performance was met with
ultimate success. Box office officials con-
ﬁrmed that tickets had been sold out before
opening night. The audience turnout was
mixed each night in that Lexington locals,
parents, and W&L students all came to see
the performance. There was laughter, silent
appreciation, and an air of satisfaction.

First-year student James Pickle came
to see the performance Friday night. He re-
marked how he felt “it was a hilarious sati-
rization of Broadway.”

W&L sophomore Graham Sheridan also
had praise for the show.

He thought that “the Johnson Theater
was a small and intimate setting that was
cohesive to appreciating the many students’
talent.”

Another ﬁrst-year student, Brooks Sim-
mons, came to see the performance Saturday
night. “It was deﬁnitely a great experience.
When you think of Washington and Lee, you
mainly think of academic talent. This show
was a great way to see that W&L students
have a lot of artistic talent as well.”

Members of the Theater department
and Mindbending rehearsed every night for
three weeks before opening night. “It was
deﬁnitely a lot of work,” explained junior
and participant Markheavens Tshuma.

And for the most part, the experience
was great for the performers as well.

Tshuma also explained how this show
was different than any other show he had
done at Washington and Lee.

“This was the ﬁrst time we combined
the 2008 Student Showcase with a thematic
performance. The two worked really well
alongside one another.”

In the long run, the grueling.rehearsal
schedule paid off because the performance
was met with huge success.

Chorus sings folk songs, prepares for South Africa

Choral concert takes on an international theme, with music inﬂuenced by both South Africa and Renaissance Italy

By Stephanie Hardiman
STAFF WRITER '

The Washington and Lee Uni-
versity Chorus began its season
with a sampling of American,
African, and African-American
folk songs on Tuesday in Wilson
Hall. The concert also featured
selections by the University
Chamber Singers, General Ad-
mission, JubiLee, and Southern
Comfort.

The chorus, led by Professor
Jerry Myers, will head to Cape-
town, South Africa for spring
break. They will perform four
concerts there and two of them

will be with local choirs.

Keeping with this intema-
tional theme, the chorus was
joined by two African drummers
who played the djembe, a skin-
covered hand drum.

Drummers Mirabai Mcleod
and Lamine F arras live in Rock-
bridge County and presented a
drumming workshop in the El-
rod Commons last year.

The pair will join the chorus
at the holiday concert later this
term and will present another
drumming workshop in Febru-
ary. Myers hopes for a few stu-
dents to learn the dj embe to trav-
el with the chorus this spring.

The chorus began the per-

formance with singers entering
from all sides of the hall to cre-
ate a truly surround-sound ex-
perience. The musical selection
was a processional song often
used in Nigeria when greeting
important leaders such as tribal
chiefs.

Sharon Chu, a junior clarinet-
ist, accompanied the chorus for
a Scottish-American folk song
popular in the southern Appa-
lachian region. Following the
American folk song was "The
Battle of Jericho”, an African-
American spiritual composed by
the late Moses Hogan.

While the chorus focused on
folk songs, the Chamber Singers

explored music of the Renais-
sance.

Most of the selections were
taken from Morten Lauridsen’s
“Madrigali: Six ‘Fire Songs’
on Italian Renaissance Poems.”
The selections were also accom-
panied by Renaissance artwork
projected onto a screen behind
the singers. The art was ar-
ranged by two senior art history
majors, Mallory Ruymann and
Brittany Simpson.

Myers said before the per-
formance began that the images
were a mixture of sacred and
secular that could conﬂict or
mesh with the selection’s lyrics.
He said he thought this was ap-

propriate since the realms of life
are often conﬂicting as well.

The performance was Myers’
debut as the Chamber Singers’
director. He said he chose the
two very different subject mat-
ters for both groups as a way to
showcase their differences.

“The two groups have dis-
tinctively different sounds . . . I
try to bring out what students in
each group do well and challenge
them to do better,” he said.

The University Chorus,
Chamber Singers, and Joyful
Noise Gospel Choir will per-
form on Friday at 8 p.m. for the
Parent’s Weekend Choral Con-
cer_t.

Southern Comfort, General
Admission, and JubiLee will
perform for the Parent’s Week-
end A Cappella Concert Satur-
day at 6 p.m.

Tickets for both events are
free to students. Contact the

Service carnival helps students give back to community

Student body comes together to serve the community, Nabors Service League boasts increased participation

By Joel Poelhuis
STAFF WRITER

Giant multi-colored inﬂata-
bles ﬁlled Cannan Green Sunday
as students arrived for an after-
noon of volunteering and service.
The tenth annual Nabors Service
Day brought together about 180
W&L volunteers for projects in
the Rockbridge County commu-
nity. The inﬂatable games were
there for a children’s carnival,
though some W&L students
tried them out beforehand.

The students volunteered
in groups and worked on tasks
from landscaping at Central El-
ementary School to picking up
trash along stretches of highway.
Other groups went to Boxer-

wood garden, Montessori, a car
.wash, and the Rockbridge Area

Occupational Center.

“This year we really wanted
to increase student participa-

tion,” said Samara Francisco,
Special Events and Projects Co-

Chair. Francisco said a good
sign was the large number of

ﬁrst-year students who partici-
pated. One of the organization’s
goals with Nabors Service Day
was to get students involved in
community service earlier.

“We did our sign-ups earlier
this year,” said General Chair

Jenna Walls. “We actually start-
ed signing people up at the cam-
pus activities fair the ﬁrst week
of school.”

However, while the sign-up
list was close to 300 names long,

under 200 students actually at-
tended.

“We had a lot of people sign
up and then a lot of people not
show up, so something to work
on is student commitment,”
Francisco said. Walls attributed
the low turnout to the midterm
crunch. Participation was up
from last year, but down from

« two years ago, when Walls said
about 300 students took part in
the event.

One student who showed up
was Lev Raslin, who said his
Resident Advisor. emailed his
hall about Nabors three weeks
ago.

“I felt it would be a good way
for me to give back to the com-
munity and explore Lexington."
said Raslin, who ended up work»

ing on the W&L garden. Raslin
said he would have preferred to
be out in the community, but en-
couraged others to participate.

“The work’s not that hard,
and it only takes a little time, so
it’s deﬁnitely worth it.”

In addition to sponsoring
Nabors Service Day, Nabors
Service League promotes indi-
vidual volunteering opportuni-
ties in conjunction with campus
and local agencies.

“What we do is try to get the
entire community involved.”
Francisco said.

The Nabors program began
in 1999 in memory of W&L
student Jonathan Nabors. His
parents, Eddie and Doris Nabors
founded the organization, and
ride the trip from Birming-

ham, Ala. Sunday to address the
volunteers. The Nabors will be
hosting the service learning al-
ternative spring break trip this
year.

Biology Professor William
Hamilton instructed the teams
of students assisting with the
W&L garden. The garden uses
compost from the dining hall’s
waste, mulch from leaves picked
up by campus mowing crews,
and work from students and fac-
ulty.

Produce from the garden sup-
plies both the W&L dining hall
and Campus Kitchens, an orga-
nization which serves meals to
area residents who need them.
According to Hamilton, locally
grown produce is much richer in
healthy antioxidants and vitamin

C than imported stock. Students
prepared the garden for winter,
working on harvesting, mulch-
ing, and woodchuck deterrence.

Volunteers who arrived at

noon ate a free lunch consisting
of sandwiches and chips. Each
volunteer received a red T—shirt,

cup, and pen with the name of

the event on them. Upcoming
on Nabors’ calendar are a Hal-
loween carnival and Hunger &

Homelessness Awareness Week

the week of November 3'“.

Dead ﬁsh in Staniar Gallery

Artist/llberto Rey s exhibit features aquatic creatures as an environmental message

By Collin Neal
STAFF WRITER

Scholars and artists have
varying opinions regarding the
purpose of art. However, there
are always those who choose
to challenge these assumptions.
The fruits of this challenge,
whether it is to the detriment or
gain of the artistic world, is al-
ways interesting. In his exhibit,
“Life, Death and Beauty” Alber-
to Rey shares with viewers his
stance on how art itself can act
as a medium for social justice.

On October 15, The Wash-
ington and Lee Arts Commu-
nity welcomed back acclaimed
artist Alberto Rey for a lecture
‘and reception in honor of the
opening of his new exhibit here.
Rey, visiting artist at W&L this
past term, titled the presentation
covering his work since 1985
“Looking for a Home.” His

work encompasses many differ-
ent media, from canvas and oils
to video, successfully keeping
the viewer entertained.

Rey describes his earlier
work as heavily inﬂuenced by
his Cuban roots combined with
his American experience as a
child. His family ﬂed Cuba to
come to America at the age of
three given the political climate.
Through his early adulthood,
he moved around sixteen times,
giving himself what he calls a
broad, unique perspective of
American culture.

His Cuban subjects range
from regional food dishes to
portraiture in both Miami and
Havana. His ﬁrst ﬁlm, entitled
“Seeing in the Dark” memorial-
izes the artist’s ﬁrst foray back
to Cuba since seeking political
refuge. Combining video, mu-
sic, and text, the video gives the

viewer a lonely, haunting feeling
of disconnection.

“In Cuba the Past is the Pres-
ent. Little Improves and Little
Changes.”

After returning from Cuba,

His latest exhibit here at
Washington and Lee focuses
on a term he calls “Biological
Regionalism,” a response to the
latest focus in the art world on
globalization and nationalism.

“The use of art as a medium for political or

social expression is, quite frankly, an abuse
of art. And while it was beautiful, I found it

upsetting. ”

Merritt Poling, sophomore

Rey had a realization that his ob-
session with Cuba was based on
nostalgia. Since seeing the real-

ity of Cuba, he decided to move _

on and his work took a different
turn. According to Rey, in Cuba
he “understood the importance
of family and fragility of life.”

His work is more of a retum
to a locally focused scope. He
strives to bridge the disconnect
between humans and the natural
world around them. The exhibit
combines large, wall-sized com-
positions of dead ﬁsh in varying
states of decay along with video

screens beckoning the viewer
through the sounds of water and
visuals of creekside activity.
These images are meant to com-
pel the viewer to consider the
most pressing environmental is-
sues of today. When questioned
about the choice of dead ﬁsh as
subject matter, Rey responded
that there was deﬁnite sadness,
but something peaceful as well
about all of them.

The exhibit’s opening was
celebrated with a reception that
included a powerpoint presen-
tation and a lecture from the
artist himself. Several faculty
members and students from
the newly formed, and still un-
named, student art league were
in attendance.

However, some students had
an objection to the subject and
Rey’s purpose behind his works.
Merritt Poling, a sophomore art

history major, found the paint-
ings’ connection to political is-
sues rather appalling.

“The use of art as a medium
for political or social expression
is, quite frankly, an abuse of art,”
Poling said. “And while it was
beautiful, I found it upsetting.”

Although the pieces were re-
ceived with some negativity, it
was still very much appreciated
by even its harshest critics. The
beauty and complexity of Rey’s
paintings make it obvious why
his work is displayed in over 20
museum collections and featured
in 130 exhibitions. It is refresh-
ing to see this university bring in
and support such an innovative
artist.

Rey’s exhibit runs through
November 5 at the Staniar Gal-
lery in Wilson Hall. The gallery
is open from 8:00 a.m. until 5:00
p.m.

Swimming splits with Mary Washington

Men 3 team wins I 70-92, women
fall 110-152 in season sﬁrst meet

ByRussWeems
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee
men’s and women’s swim
teams opened their seasons this
Saturday against Mary Wash-
ington. The men came away
with a 170-92 blowout vic-
tory while the Eagles edged the
Lady Generals 152-110.

W&L men’s team had 10
event victories in the meet Sat-
urday. Junior Winston Stagg
led the way with two individual
victories and a relay win. He
won the 100 breast (1202.79),
the 200 breast (2218.65), and
was a part of the winning 200
medley relay (l:38.53). First-
year Brian Stirling, junior
Brandon Bamds and senior
Paul Crook joined Stagg in the
relay victory.

Crook and Stirling (along
with senior Brett Tatman and
ﬁrst—year Brad Harder) also
won the 400 free relay in a time

Lady Eagles have ﬁnished ﬁrst
in the Capital Athletic Confer-
ence. “We’re deﬁnitely closing
the gap between us and teams
like Mary Washington,” said
Gardner.

Both teams are looking to
build on their strong 2007-2008
seasons. The men were 9-2 last
year ﬁnishing in second place
at the Bluegrass Mountain Con-
ference Championships and in
8th place at the NCAA Cham-
pionships. Graduation did hit
the Generals hard, however,
as they lost BMC Swimmer of
the Year Alex Sweet along with
All-BMC swimmers Will Hart-
mann and Tim McGlaston.

Junior Winston Stagg is not
worried about replacing last
year’s seniors. “We look at los-
ing considerable talent last year
as an opportunity -— an oppor-
tunity for teammates to step up
and to carry last year’s momen-
tum into this season.”

tered two individual wins in
the 200 free (1244.15) and the
500 free (4:47.99). Junior Dan
Austin came out on top in the
1,000 free (10:19.5l).

Three ﬁrst-years won in-
dividual races in their debuts:
Chris Washnock took the 200
back in a time of 1:59.61, Ryan
Hartman won in the 200 butter-
ﬂy (2200.66), and Harder added
to his relay win with a victory
in the 100 back (55.52).

The women were defeated
110-152 but had some strong
individual perfonnances.
First-year Dana Fredericks was
a bright spot in the loss. She
opened her college career with
two victories. She took the 100
breast in 1:10.41 and the 200
individual medley with a time
of 2:18.25. Senior Lindsey
Strachan also had a good day
individually, winning the 200
back in a time of2: 13.80.

Despite the loss, women’s
head coach Kami Gardner said,
“I think they [W&L swimmers]
are very happy with their per-
formances.” The Mary Wash-
ington women’s swimming
team is known as one of the bet-
ter programs in all of Division
III. For 18 straight seasons, the

After swimming a good
meet Saturday, many are ex-
pecting the men’s ﬁrst—year
swimmers to have a great im-
pact on the team this year.

“Saturday’s performance
showed our freshmen are im-
mediately capable of contrib-
uting. The freshmen class has
serious talent,” said Stagg.

The women finished sec-
ond in the ODAC last year and
were picked to win it this year
in the ODAC Preseason Poll.
The Lady Generals lost All-
ODAC swimmer Amy Rober-
son to graduation but will re-
turn ODAC Rookie of the Year
Tess Hayden.

Gardner said, “As a whole,
I want the women to develop
into a great team that is sup-
portive of each other’s goals
and obviously to succeed at the
ODAC and national level.”

W&L’s women return to

-the pool Saturday at 11:00 a.m.

when they host the ODAC Fall
Invitational for Parents Week-
end. On the other hand, the
men’s team does not compete
again until Oct. 31 when they
travel to Transylvania.

Field hockey crushes Virginia Wesleyan 5-]  
A Saturday but falls to Sewanee 2-0 Sunday

By Llzz Dye
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee’s ﬁeld
hockey team had reason to cele-
brate with its fourth consecutive
win against Virginia Wesleyan
Saturday. The Generals ﬁnished
the game with a 5-1 victory over
the Blue Marlins.

W&L jumped out to a quick
lead, scoring two goals within
the ﬁrst 5 minutes. Junior mid-
ﬁelder Alex Caritis thought that
the momentum from the two
early goals carried the Generals
throughout the entire 70 min-
utes. “It was great to get a lead
early on and then maintain that
lead throughout the game. The
offense did a great job, and the
defense really stayed strong the
whole game.”

Junior forward Sallie Arm-
strong put one up on the board

when she dribbled around the
Virginia Wesleyan’s ﬁrst-year
goalie Chelsea Baker just 1:33
into the game. A little over two
minutes later, senior forward
Christina Merchant shot another
one by Baker to hand the Gener-
als the early 2-0 lead.

Assisted by Merchant, ﬁrst-
year Christina Benedetti scored
the Generals’ third goal at 21:26.
Benedetti noted that W&L’s
scoring attacks came from many
different players. “I knew it
was going to be a good day for
the Generals when all three for-
wards scored in the ﬁrst twenty
minutes. It was great to get my
fourth goal of the season during
such an exciting game.”

After surrendering three goals
in 15 minutes, Baker was pulled
from the game and replaced by
sophomore Kieara Mowery. A

new goalie, however, did not

prevent the Generals from creat-

ing more scoring opportunities.
Sophomore Kathy Brown

senior forward Melissa Dolan
tacked on a ﬁfth goal.

It seemed that the Generals
defense was going to secure its

“Saturday is game against I/zrginia Wesleyan
showed how dynamic W&L ﬁeld hockey can
be. We scored off of fast breaks and penalty

corners; we were strong offensively and

defensively; and our transitions made the

game. ’

Caroline Habllston, junlor goalkeeper
 

ended the ﬁrst half by bringing
W&L to a 4-0 lead with an unas-
sisted goal at 33:11. With eight
minutes to play in the game,

ﬁrst shutout of the season when
Virginia Wesleyan’s Whitney
King scored on a defensive cor-
ner with three seconds left in the

game.

Nonetheless, the Generals
played one of their best games
of the season. Junior goalkeeper
Caroline Habilston relished the
blowout victory. “Saturday’s
game against Virginia Wesleyan
showed how dynamic W&L ﬁeld
hockey can be. We scored off of
fast breaks and penalty corners;
we were strong offensively and

I defensively; and our transitions
made the game. It is always fun
to be a part of a team that scores
early and often.”

Habilston played the entire
game in goal and saved four
shots. The Generals had 23 shots
on goal and ﬁve penalty corners
while Virginia Wesleyan tallied
nine and ﬁve, respectively. Dur-
ing the four-game winning streak
between October 9 and 18, the
Generals outshot their opponents

94-30 and outscored them 14-6.

W&L returned to action Sun-
day in a non-conference bout
with Sewanee. The ﬁrst half
ended scoreless after going back
and forth.

Just 11 minutes into the sec-
ond half, the Tigers got on the
board with a penalty comer goal
from senior midﬁelder Claiborne
Buckingham. Senior forward
Lynn Hancock added an insur-
ance goal ﬁve minutes ‘later.
Sewanee’s senior goalkeeper
Clarkie Crawford came up big as
the Generals outshot the Tigers
20 to 6.

W&L returned to ODAC ac-
tion Wednesday travelling to
Randolph-Macon, but results
were not available as of press
time. The Generals face Sweet
Briar next Saturday at 2:00 p.m.
for Parents Weekend.

Women’s soccer beats Mary Washington

F irst—year Kat Barnes earns hat trick in Saturday 3 5-2  has 14 goals this season

By Adam Cancryn
STA FF WRITER

Forward Kat Barnes can now
add perfect timing to her long
list of ﬁrst-year contributions.

Coming off of last week’s
close conference loss to Lynch-
burg, Barnes turned in her best
performance of the year. The
forward’s three goals put the
Generals back on track with a 5-
2 blowout of Mary Washington
University.

With crucial ODAC games
coming up, the women’s soccer
team wasted no time in putting
its opponent away. Taking ad-
vantage of Mary Washington’s
shaky defense, W&L scored
twice in the ﬁrst 15 minutes.

Barnes notched the ﬁrst one,
taking a left foot cross from
senior forward Anne Van Dev-
ender and heading the ball past
the keeper.

A few minutes later, senior
midﬁelder Katie Kern extended
the lead with a point-blank shot
off of a corner kick. She would
score again later in the half, giv-
ing W&L a 3-1 lead going into
halftime.

According to head coach
Neil Cunningham, the Gener-
als found offensive success by
capitalizing on their opponent’s
unusual defensive formation.

“I told them [the team] to
quit trying to ﬁgure it out and
just play,” Curmingham said of

his strategy.

The simple ‘approach worked
especially for Kat Barnes, who
broke out in the second half.

minute. One-on—one with a de-
fender, Barnes worked the ball

down the right side of the ﬁeld,
cut it back to her left foot, and
launched a curling shot that hit
the far post and deﬂected in.

“It was a combined effort of
all the forwards that I got open,”
she said of her offensive suc-
cess. “Because they had three
in the back, [our forwards] were
basically one v. one the whole
game.”

Saturday’s match was
Barnes’ ﬁrst career hat trick and
5“‘ multi-goal game of the sea-
son. She leads the team with 14,
four away from tying the ﬁrst-
year record set by Erica Reineke
in 1994. _

More importantly, though,
the win gives the Generals mo-

mentum with the ODAC tourna-
ment less than two weeks away.
The team is third in the confer-
ence with a record of 6-2.

Coach Cunningham believes
they have a great chance if they
can duplicate Saturday’s suc-
cess. '

“We could win the next three
games and...make a run in the
tournament,” he said. “1t’s a
matter of, we’ve got to win on
the road.”

W&L played host to Emory

were not available as of press
time. Next up for the Generals
is a home ODAC match against
Guilford Saturday at 3:00 p.m.

Generals lose Second Straight game, fall to I -2 in ODAC

By Brian Devine
snrr wmrsn

Before Washington and
Lee’s home football game
against Hampden—Sydney,
Generals head coach Frank
Miriello described a simple
path to victory: discipline, in-
tensity and enthusiasm. To the
team’s credit, they lived up to
the last tw_o.

But when all was said and
done, W&L had lost its ﬁrst
home matchup in 13 games,
falling 39-29 to the nationally
ranked Tigers.

Lack of discipline certainly
played a role in the loss, but
both teams suffered from stu-
pid turnovers and penalties.
The real difference, then, was
that the visitors showed in the
second half why they are the
cream of the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference this sea-
son, by outclassing the Gener-
als in just about every way.

The Tigers boast one of the
best dual-threat backﬁelds in
recent ODAC history. .Senior
quarterback Corey Sedlar and
senior tailback Josh Simpson
are among the top two at their
respective positions in the
conference and led H-SC to
the conference title last year.

Now one year older and
wiser, they have brought their
squad to the No. 20 national
ranking (before Saturday’s
game at Wilson Field) and a
more or less clear path to a
second consecutive confer-
ence title.

It took a while for the Ti-
gers to get going on Saturday.
W&L actually led at the half
by a single point, 22-21. The
Generals also scored ﬁrst in
the third quarter and it seemed
to the few brave fans assem-
bled in the cold that W&L

could pull off a marvelous up-
set victory.

But after W&L ﬁrst-year
quarterback Charlie Westfal
fumbled the football for the
second time, it took the Tigers
only three plays to tie the score
at 29 following a successful
two—point conversion. Later
in the third quarter Sedlar
led his team on a time-heavy
86-yard drive that included
two successful fourth-down
conversions and ended with a
ﬁeld goal. On W&L’s ensuing
possession Westfal fumbled
again, and it took the Tigers
just ﬁve plays to reach the end
zone, putting themselves up
by ten.

If not for his three fumbles,
Westfal probably would have
had the best game of his col-
lege career. He completed 25 of
46 passes for 252 yards, most
of them to fellow ﬁrst-year
Cody Smith. Smith, playing a
signiﬁcant role in the offense
for the ﬁrst time, tied a school
record with three consecutive
touchdown receptions, and

nearly had a fourth that was
just over his head after a de-
ﬂection. The understanding
between Westfal and Smith is
promising, and we should see
great things from both of them
over the next four years.

But part of the reason the
Generals took to the air with
such frequency was the injury
of tailback Stuart Sitterson.
Sitterson, the team’s best of-
fensive player this year, was
removed in the second quarter
with a rib injury. With its cap-
tain and leader gone, the rush-
ing attack vanished. Westfal
ended up as the team’s lead-
ing rusher on the day with 88
yards.

The Generals defense also
failed to stop the Sedlar-Simp-
son combo when it needed
to. The hosts yielded a total
of 467 yards, including 363
through the air. Sedlar was
rarely troubled in the back-
ﬁeld, and when he had time
to throw, he picked apart a po-
rous pass defense.

Junior linebacker Matt

Cassilly was again the bright
spot of the defense, recording
11 tackles and recovering one
fumble. The defense also in-
tercepted Sedlar twice, though
the team was unable to capi-
talize on these opportunities
the way its opponent did.

In the end, then, the Tigers
were a better team, perhaps
the best team in the ODAC for
the last several years. But dis-
cipline was once again sorely
lacking from the Generals’ ef-
forts.

If W&L hopes to salvage its
season (they are now 4-3, 1-2
in ODAC play), they will have
to commit fewer turnovers and
capitalize on the chances they
have. Their ﬁrst opportunity?
Parents’ Weekend, when the
squad hosts Guilford Col-
lege at 1:00 p.m. Saturday. It
should be a high-scoring af-
fair, as Guilford quarterback
Josh Vogelbach is among the
conference’s all-time leaders
in passing yardage, but Guil-
ford also has the worst pass
defense in the conference.
