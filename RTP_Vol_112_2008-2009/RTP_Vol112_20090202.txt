VOLUME CXII,

Closing the
leadership gap

Author and activist Marie C. Wilson
speaks at W&L about the need for
more women leaders in the US.

By Jessica Stralt
s TA F F w R I T E R

When Marie C. Wilson was head of the Ms. Foundation for
Women, created to support women socially, economically and po-
litically, she found that the best policy ideas were coming from
women not involved in politics or corporations.

So Wilson, who also co-founded Take Our Daughters to Work
Day, created the White House Project, a program designed to train
and put a diverse group of women into elected oﬂices and corpo-
rate boardrooms. As Wilson spoke in Stackhouse Theater on Jan.
26, she challenged Washington and Lee women to reach their own
leadership goals.

Wilson said women’s leadership in the United States is “stuck”
because many women are not taking on leadership roles in college
and missing out on leadership experience.

“Every time women decide not to lead, they get setback,” Wil-
sonlsaid. “If they cut back, it’s hard to get caught up in a culture
that changes so much.”

Wilson said the United States 715‘ in the world for women’s
political leadership, which is behind Iraq (33"’), the Sudan (65“‘)
and North Korea (57“‘), according to an article Wilson wrote for
Feminist.com.

 

“Every time women decide not to lead, they
get set back. If they cut back, its hard to
get caught up in a culture that changes so

much. ”

Marie C. Wilson, White House Project founder

“Women are out of leadership because people think they’re al-
ready in leadership,” she said.

In the United States, women make up 51 percent of the popu-
lation, but only 15 percent of Congress and 14 percent of board
seats of Fortune 500 companies, she said.

Wilson argued that women are needed more than ever because
they bring different ideas and styles to leadership positions. The
reason is that they have learned to lead by being on the outside, “at
the foot of the table,” she said. '

To help women transition to the inside, Wilson founded Vote,
Run, Lead, a progressive, non-partisan program, which has al-
ready trained 6,000 women to run for political ofﬁces and hopes to
train 40,000 in the next few years.

Wilson’s goal is to give women power in numbers. When one
woman runs, she said, media focuses only on “hair, hemlines, and
husbands.” Add more women, and it becomes an issue of “agen-
da, not gender.”

Cortney Patterson, a ﬁrst-year who worked for a political
consulting ﬁrm last summer, found Wilson’s points applicable to
the world of politics, and noted that the media can often give the
wrong impression.

“The media can make it seem like women can’t be anywhere
without men behind them,” Patterson said.

Wilson said that women have the ability but need encourage-
ment. She cited polls showing that most people do trust women
on every leadership trait except decisiveness. But women are not
moving to leadership levels in proportion to the public’s comfort
level.

The root of the problem is that the idea of women leaders

doesn’t become accepted until people see it, according to Wilson. .

The responsibility for change in women’s power also rests with
populariculture, which has already madesmall steps forward with
the creation of a White House Barbie and a TV show featuring a
female President, she said.

Wilson stressed the importance of women honestly and openly
discussing their ambitions with each other. She emphasized that
women moving each other along and working together would be
a huge improvement from the way women often pull each other
down.

Wilson is the author of the book, “Closing the Leadership Gap:
Add Women, Change Everything.”

Breach of

Sophomore EC representative asked to resign

By Holly Suthers
STAFF WRITER

A student has resigned from
the Executive Committee (EC)
for violating rules for possibly
the ﬁrst time in Washington
and Lee history, according to
EC President Rich Cleary.

After allegedly violating a
conﬁdientiality code, sopho-
more Richard Saum has been
asked to step down from the
committee.

According to the EC’s
public announcement, Saum
violated the conﬁdentiality and
harrassment clause of the White
Book, a student hand book de-
scribing the honor system and
procedures for honor trials. The
clause states:

“The Executive Commit-
tee may take disciplinary steps
against any student involved in
an investigation, any student
witness in a hearing, any advo-

cate, any Executive Commit-
tee II1€II1bE$i.I' the accused for
breaking thi conﬁdentiality.”

Cleary said he could not
disclose the nature of the viola-
tions or the structure oricontent
of the EC ’s ﬁnding process.

In cooperation with the com-

his lack of judgment. He also
said that this has been a very
good learning experience.

“I don’t know ifit would be
appropriate for me to disclose,
but I fully support the actions
of the EC,” Saum said.

Saum has been a member

“I fully support the actions of the EC... This
has not altered my view of the EC or W&L...

The entire experience has certainly been a

learning experience. ’

Rlchard Saum, former EC member

mittee, Saum has voluntarily
resigned. Declining to give the
circumstances of his removal,
Saum stated that he violated the
EC conduct code and regrets

of the EC for two years. He is
active in many roles on campus
including Traveler Dispatch
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon fra-
temity.

Working with the Voting
Regulations Board, the EC has
already held another election to
ﬁll the empty spot.

Sarah Catherine Welch has
been elected as the new sopho-
more representative.

“She was a member of the
White Book Review Commit-
tee so she has a general knowl-
edge of it. I anticipate a smooth
transition for her,” Cleary said.
“I think... Sarah Catherine
will contribute substantially for
honor matters of the EC.”

Saum’s resignation is in ef-
fect only for the remainder of
this Executive Committee term.
He plans to run for the position
again this spring.

“This has not altered my
view of the EC or W&L...The
entire experience has certainly
been a learning experience,”
said Saum.

Who was Osama?

Journalist Steve Coll unearths bin Laden is past

By Joel Poelhuls
STAFF ‘WRITER

Osama bin Laden’s success
with al-Qaeda is largely due to
his experience and proﬁciency
in a modern global context,

according to Pulitzer prize-'

winning author and journalist
Steve Coll.

Coll discussed bin Laden’s
family history and worldview at
length in his speech “Osama bin
Laden and the Globalization of
Terror” at a packed Stackhouse
Theatre last Wednesday. Coll,
who writes for The New Yorker
and has written two books on
the Middle East, said bin Lad-
en’s attitude toward the West
grew not out of ignorance, but
a long line of experiences built
with his role in the family con-
tracting business.

“He was a man of the world

‘— he was not isolated,” Coll

said.
The author identiﬁed bin

Laden as a fairly normative ‘

member of his society during
most of his life: both as a prod-
uct of the transnational Sunni
islamist movement that sprung
up after the Iranian revolution
and a member of the oil-baby-
boom generation in Saudi Ara-
bia.

their power to reinforce a hard-
line traditionalist worldview.
Coll portrayed bin Laden as
“a man whose ideology looks
back to the 7th century,” but
who is a master of modern
global strategies such as using
satellite cell phones, making

“He was a man of the world——he was not

isolated...His personality, his ideology, his

radicalism, is inseperable from this sense of

purcahse. ”

Steve coll, New Yorker columnist, Pulltzer prize-wlnner

This generation was the ﬁrst
in Saudi to have the wealth
and mobility to purchase any
identity they wanted, said Coll.
Some, like Osama’s oldest
brother Salem, used this op-
portunity to lead an extrava-
gant and Westemized lifestyle,
while others, like Osama, used

viral recruitment videos, and
brand management -— crafting
the appeal of al-Qaeda.

“His personality, his ideol-
ogy, his radicalism, is insepa-
rable from this sense of pur-
chase,” he said.

Yet Coll said this new glo-
balization is affecting Gulf

culture in other ways today.
Growing up saturated with
Western media has changed
expectations for many young
people — especially when it
comes to interactions with the
opposite sex. Coll said he be-
lieves an enormous amount of
social pressure is building up
under the restraints of tradition-
al gender relations, which may
alter the way future generations
View the West.

Coll’s speech was spon-
sored by the Fishback Fund for
Visiting Writers. The fund has
previously brought speakers
such as legal scholar Stephen
Carter, sociologist Alan Wolfe
and journalist Robert Kaplan to
campus. After the speech, Coll
signed copies of his books: The
Bin Ladens: An Arabian Fami-
ly in the American Century and
Ghost Wars: The Secret History
of the CIA, Afghanistan and
Bin Laden, from the Soviet In-
vasion to September 10, 2001.

I Dear Mr.Centorino, » ’

‘ I f I readlyour article on the speaking tradition in the Ring-Tum
Phi of January 26th and wanted to tell you and the editors how:
impressed I was with it. Next to the honor code, I believe that
the speaking tradition is perhaps our most cherished tradition
at.W&L.. It reflects not oniy civility and etiquette, but also our

. sharedsense of community. The perhaps apocryphal story of
 Doremus visiting our campus in the early 20th century and

being soimpressed by the speaking tradition that he donated a
gymnasium tothe school nevertheless reﬂects how strangers to
our campus mayalso‘ be affected by our friendliness and sense

I ofhospitality. .

Perhaps a bit of background would be helpﬁil. I am from a

- family which has sent four generations consecutively to Wash-
ington and Lee. I tuna member of the third generation, having

' graduated in 1966, and when I was in school the speaking tradi-

i tion was very much alive. You might even say it was being en-

, forced atthat time, partly by something called the assimilation
 committee and partly by an unwritten rule among students and

I » faculty. When my two sons attended here from 1995 through ,

2003, I noticed that the tradition had fallen off somewhat, but
I was still being practiced to some degree...I returned to Lexing-
ton in spring, 2008 and have built a home here. I am on campus
a good deal, and I have to say that from my experience over al-
most an entire year the speaking tradition is almost dead. When
you say, “if one generation of students ignore it, the tradition
wiIldie,”_ Ifhave to respond that it seems pretty moribund to
me now, Rememberthat the tradition is‘ not just about speak-
ing to those you know or even to all of your fellow students; it
is about speaking to everyone on campus whenever you come
. across them. ‘ ‘
I My own personal approach to this problem has been to speak
, to everyone I meet whether they speak to me or not, but I am
I ’ not sure how much difference this is making. If we admit that
something is dead or at least in a comatose state, then we can
seek to ﬁnd a wayto revive it. So far as I can tell this can only
be done by students, and by this I mean a group or groups of
students. Let me give you an example. If the entire staff of
the “Ring~Tum Phi," for example, decided to make and wear
some large badges saying, “Revive the Speaking Tradition” and
spoke to everyone they met for a year, this could make a dif-
ference‘, If allor many fraternities and sororities did the same
thing, this couldbe even more inﬂuential. As much as I admire
v your recent editorial, it, in and of itself, will make very little dif-
I ference. It is only by concerted action of a group of people that
this most worthy of our traditions can be revived.

A I do not wish to be seen as in any way critical of W and L or
of its students. My desire is to be helpful in contributing to the
revival of a tradition which I believe is very important to who
We are.Frommy‘ perspective, if I can be helpful in any way in

working on the revival of the speaking tradition by any group of

;;st11dentsHI...would be happy to do so.

Sincerely,
. Neely Young, Class of 1966

Those applying for a job with
the new administration need not
worry about paying Uncle Sam.
While not paying your taxes and
breaking the law sounds like a
career-killer for public servants
it defenitly hasn’t been as of
late. Some of President Obama’s
most notable cabinet appointees
have shown a complete disre-
gard for the tax laws everyone
else is expected to abide by.

Imagine if everyone were to
follow the excellent example set
by our new Treasury Secretary,
Timothy Geithner. Geithner did
not see a need to pay nearly
$40,000 in taxes until he real-
ized that not paying them might
be an issue when facing Senate
conﬁrmation hearings. Did it
not occur to anyone that a top
government ofﬁcial, especially

one in charge of our economic
recovery, should not have a his-
tory of stealing money from the
government? That’s essentially
what not paying taxes is, steal-
ing money that should go to the
government to pay for the pro-
grams Geithner and the rest of
Obama’s economic team say are
necessary.

Do they not see the hypocri-
sy in this? It’s like having a Sur-
geon General who drinks and
smokes while pregnant. “Do
as I say, not as a pay” is not an
effective government model.
There is no doubt Geithner was
more than qualiﬁed enough to
lead the Treasury Department,
and of course he did end up
paying the taxes he was legally
liable for before the Senate con-
ﬁrmation hearings, but naming a
tax-evader to the Cabinet sets a
horrible precedent.

Geithner’s transgression
would be just a smudge on
Obama’s supposedly spectacu-
lar cabinet if he were the only
one who had “accidentally”
ripped off Uncle Sam. Now we
know Tom Daschle, former Sen-
ate Majority Leader and current
nominee to head the Department
of Health and Human Services,
also didn’t think it necessary to
pay his taxes. One tax-delin-
quent nominee is an accident,
two is a trend.

In the past few weeks, Das-
chle has paid a mindboggling
$140,000 in back taxes and in-
terest. Much of that money was
due to a car and driver loaned
to him for free by a Democratic
fundraiser. Political favors like

these sound exactly like the.

type of “politics as usual” we all
expect President Obama to rally
against. How is the Obama Ad-

  Do as I say, not as I pay

Obama is cabinet has had too many problems paying taxes

ministration supposed to hold
Wall Street accountable when
they don’t even hold some of
their officials accountable?

This is not a partisan issue.
I am sure if we go over the tax
returns of inﬂuential Republi-
cans we will ﬁnd more than a
few discrepancies as well. Yet
the idea that “public servants”
who depend on tax revenue do
not pay taxes themselves and
can still be considered for lead-
ership positions is ridiculous. I
don’t care how qualiﬁed some-
one is, the second they break the
law, they shouldn’t be part of
our government.

Many members of the past V

administration were rightfully
criticized for thinking they were
above the law. Someone needs
to remind the Obama Admin-
istration they are not above the
tax code.

Where’s the Lip syncing?

Li}? Sync should be about a great act, not just about srats and from

By Dlandra Splcak
COLUM NIST

Lip sync ‘09 went off with
the usual hitches, glitches and
lack of britches. And the gossip
is already churning — who per-
formed what, who wore what,
and what happened backstage.
While Lip Sync has its roots
in the right place — charitably
raising money for food pantries
around Virginia — it also holds
a place high in the social life of
most Washington and Lee stu-
dents.

Besides a way to raise mon-
ey, Lip Sync ‘has become a way
for fraternities and sororities
to showcase their new pledge
classes. What a pledge class
performs reﬂects on its respec-
tive frat or srat, and should ul-
timately show off the qualities
the frat or srat desires in its
members. When planning their
routine, group members should
have kept in mind that what they

present to the audience repre-
sents their respective Greek or-
ganizations.

What does it say of certain or-
ganizations if their pledge class
representatives perform overtly
sexual routines? More so, what
does it say when their represen-
tatives step out on stage, stum-
bling, obviously having thrown
back one too many alcoholic
beverages?

Pledge class routines have
the opportunity to character-
ize and establish the reputation
of their individual social clubs.
Lip Sync has evolved over the
years to be much more than a
charitable event, but an event
that has social connotations for
those who participate.

More so, for those who par-
ticipate, Lip Sync is a time in-
vestment. Groups spend hours
(sometimes even, hours upon
hours) creating and perfect-
ing their routines. Most groups
put a lot of time and effort into

their routines, and should be al-
lowed to showcase them to the
audience. It takes a lot of guts to
perform, as I speak from recent
experience, and those who do
step up to the challenge should
be allowed to follow it through.

No group ever wants to hear
the clang of the gong during the
middle of their routine. Groups
shouldwbe gonged if, and only
if, their routines do not come
off as tasteful. Simply, a set of
general guidelines should be
agreed upon and enacted when
judging.

Basically, the guidelines for
gonging should include the fol-
lowing: if the routine is overtly
sexual or extremely raunchy, if
members are noticeably drunk
or under the inﬂuence of vari-
ous substances, or if the routine
is poorly performed. If such
guidelines are agreed upon be-
fore the event and the judges
exhibit a non-biased attitude,
then Lip Sync would prove to

be a much better, more judicial
contest. Judges should not allow
personal bias to cloud their deci-
sions, and should instead focus
on the overall ideal of competi-
tion: may the bcst men or wom-
en win -— keyword, “best.”

Best does not mean which
group performed the most sex-
ual routine, or which group had
more friends bbehindgthe judges
table, or which group exposed
the most skin. Best, in terms of
competition, means the most
well-perforrned, most entertain-
ing act. The competition was
blown out of the water by the
Klazics and Pi Beta Sigma, as
predicted, but did the best group
really take the coveted third
spot? I think not. Did the judges
perform their duty as non-biased
moderators? Perhaps.

But, only time will tell if Lip
Sync can rise above being a frat
and srat popularity contest — and
begin to be an actual competi-
tion.

What are ‘ladies’ and ‘gentlemen,’ anyway?

In part one of a series on men and women cu‘ W&L, Aleisha Butler examines

how bad deﬁnitions of ‘vice ’ for students might cause ‘Womanizers ’and ‘sluts ’

By Alelsha Butler
C O L U M N I ST

Let’s set a scene: Its 11:45
on a Saturday night. A little too
early to go to bed, but that dance
ﬂoor is getting sweaty and slip-

_pery and that music really is
just a little too loud. Leaving
the room to get some air, you
see a guy and girl, hand in hand,
heading upstairs to where the
bedrooms are. His buddies are
snickering and slapping him
on the back as he walks by,
grinning, and the girl’s face is
turned toward the ﬂoor, toward

the wall, away from the gaze of

the other party—goers who know
just what they’re heading up-
stairs to do. You’re pretty sure
that you saw that guy with a dif-
ferent girl last night, but who
knows. It happens all the time

around here... .

In this inaugural article, I’d
like to ask you to think about
what it means to be a lady or a
gentleman.

How do these elusive char-
acters carry themselves? How
do they treat one another?

Washington and Lee has a
culture all its own, and we be-

gin internalizing the rules of

that culture the day we move all
our worldly possessions into an

un-airconditioned shoebox in
Graham-Lees. Suddenly and
for the ﬁrst time in our relative-
ly short lives we are living next-
door to members of the opposite
sex, free of parental lockdown.
For a while we hang onto
the values and morals that we
brought from home, but then we
begin to change. New friends
with different backgrounds, pro-

~ fessors who challenge us to look

at the world through fresh eyes
and an overwhelmingly permis-
sive social scene. .. all combine
to subtly (or obviously) alter
our worldviews and to push us
into the process of growing up.
College shapes us into the men
and women that we will be, so
my question is: what is W&L
shaping us into?

I polled some people about
their impressions of the words
“lady” and “gentleman,” and I
heard some expected and some
surprising answers.

When I asked for the deﬁni-
tion of a lady I was given words
like mild-mannered, educated,
respectable, sophisticated and
proper. The responses for the
deﬁnition of a gentleman were
similar, and overall it seemed
that ladies and gentlemen are
expected to maintain cool, re-

served behavior and not to
make spectacles of themselves
or act out.

There was one response,
however, that really caught
my attention and that I want
to examine here. One of my
respondents said “a lady keeps
her vices private; if she drinks
or has sex, you don’t know
about it.” He then went on to
say that he believes the same to
be true for a gentleman. If he
has vices, we don’t know about
it. If he womanizcs, he does it

discretely. My next question for ‘

this young man was then, “why
is sex for women a vice?” He
responded by saying, “I don’t
know, but for women it’s still
perceived that way.”

The term “womanize” tends
to carry a powerful, if some-
what lecherous, connotation.

Womanizers are rascals, mis-
chievous young devils who sow
their wild oats with carefree
abandon and maintain a domi-
nant, desired position among
their peers. They may not settle
down, but damn it, they’re good
at what they do.

For women, on the other
hand, there is no comparable
term, although in this mod-
ern era it has become common

knowledge that women like sex
as much as men, and are per-
fectly capable of initiating the
act. Women who enjoy a great
deal of sex with multiple part-
ners do not “manize,” they sim-
ply sleep around. They do not
enjoy an exalted status; other
women don’t want to be them.

Women who sleep around
are sluts, and are looked down
upon by men and women alike,
even though the former tend to
“beneﬁt” from the behavior of
said sluts. It seems to me that
women’s honor, such as it is, is
intricately interwoven with their
sexual comportment, whereas it
is nowhere near the same for
men.

Here at W&L there seems
to be a dynamic interaction be-
tween the characteristics that

- deﬁne sluts, ladies and prudes.

Perhaps, in the 21st century, we
need to update our ideas about
what it means to be a lady and a
gentleman, because it seems that
we maintain a kind of “double-
think” in our expectations about
normal, reasonable behavior for
each of the sexes.

Our expectations of ladies
and gentlemen have changed,
but our deﬁnitions have yet to
catch up with our expectations.

Weekend

“The Apotheosis of Vaclav
Drda ” will feature a deliciously
diverse cast of characters

By Liz Blackwood
STAFF women

For Joanna, the main character in “The Apotheosis of Va-
clav Drda,” nothing seems to be going right. Her director and
ex—boyfriend, Nick, is too much of a pushover to give any
real guidance or help; her co-stars struggle with a range of
personal problems, including huge egos and tiny I.Q.’s; and
her theater space is actually a tiny apartment.

Written and directed by Christopher Cartmill ’84, The
Apotheosis tells the story of Joanna, a frustrated and strug-

gling actress who desperately tries to sustain her career by -

borrowing money ﬁom her skeptical parents to fund a pro-
duction of her favorite play.

“It’s about why we do what it is we do and how we deﬁne
success—and hopefully, have fun doing it,” says Cartmill,
who has written over 30 plays, most of which, he says, he

Unfortunately for Joanna...nothing

over...her co-stars struggle with a range

egos and tiny I.Q. is, and her theater

space is actually a tiny apartment.

feels lucky enough to have had produced and shown.

Although a major in Chinese while at Washington and
Lee, Cartmill was always involved with theatre, acting in sev-
eral of the plays and taking many courses that would further
enhance his love for the art.

“I always knew I-would end up doing theatre,” he told me
at a recent preview of “Vaclav,” choosing to study something
else, like Chinese, purely as a passion.

However, Cartmill has breached the gap between his two
interests, by writing a play partially in Chinese, an addition to
the thirty plus he already has penned.

“Vaclav” is unique, though, in its depiction of a play, with-
in another play. Cartmill has successfully craﬁed both to suit

_ and carry each other

The background story of Drda, as a character, and the ac-
tual play he was supposed to have written not only inspire
the actors, but also later help them to work through their own
problems.

Joanna admires Drda and chooses his play, to showcase
her talents in her favorite theatre piece. She secretly hopes to
catch the eye of a casting producer or agent.

Unfortunately for Joanna, her co-stars’ motives for do-
ing the play with no compensation are less passionate than
Joanna’s.

Played by Kevin Mannering, Gabriel, an egocentric dra-
ma queen, is only doing the play because his agent asked him
to bulk up his resume.

Another character, Celeste, played by Marquita Robinson,
is Joanna’s support and comic relief. Steve, played by Dave
Curran, reiterates throughout the play that he’s just there to,
heaven forbid, enjoy himself.

Everything seems to go downhill, however, when the audi-
ence joins the story already in progress, during one late night
rehearsal. Gabriel is throwing a temper tantrum and Joanna is
obviously frustrated by his immature and selﬁsh actions.

The director, played by Johnny Coyle, is no help in pacify-
ing everyone’s quickly rising tempers, bouncing back between

The KLAZICS dance group took home first place with their show stealing choreography and humor.

This year is lip sync engages, rather than enrages, the crowd

By Jean Chapman
STAFF WRITER

For anyone who remembers Lip Sync last
year, this year’s show was a whole different
animal. To get the ball rolling, ﬁve house
mothers of various fraternities arid sororities
on campus opened the show with a spirited
rendition of ‘‘It’s Raining Men.” One ob-
server commented that the house mothers’
act was “a breath of fresh air” and that it was

“You could tell that most of
the groups worked extremely
hard on their routines...it

wasn ’t easy. ”

Dlandra Splcak, first-year

great “to have competitors who can have a
little fun and put on a great show.”

Not only was the house mother’s perfor-
mance a crowd pleaser, but it set the tone for
the rest of the show. Whereas last year ’s Lip
Synch was somewhat marred by what one
student called “the drunken gonging,” this
year all of the frats and srats really stepped it
up, putting on well-choreographed and well-
executed show across the board. _

As another ﬁrst at this year’s event, Alpha
Delta Pi made their Lip Synch debut and they
were certainly hard to miss. Their 4 groups of
girls all showed of their sorority pride with

classy, talented acts that deﬁnitely drew a
positive response from the crowd. They were
amongst the ﬁrst and the last to perform and
they deﬁnitely represented a welcome addi-
tion to the night’s events. ,

Despite numerous impressive acts, the
epic face-off between the KLAZICS and
Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity stole the show.
Phi Beta Sigma performed first, showing off
their incredible dance-ﬂoor skills as well as
their sense of humor (their rendition of “Put
a Ring on It” was priceless). They fulﬁlled
their initial promise to the audience to shock,
amaze, and make the ladies go crazy.

The men of Phi Beta Sigma brought the
house down with ﬂawless choreography and
professionalism. Though they may have only
received second place this year, they were
without a doubt a crowd favorite and tough
act to follow.

Next up to bat were the ultimate champi-
ons of the night, the KLAZICS. As the Lip
Synch’s only mixed-gender dancing group
this year, their impressive mix of dance
styles and amazingly multi-talented danc-
ers ultimately won them the trophy for this
year. The most stunning part of their act was
undoubtedly the break dancing segment and
the other acrobatic elements of their per-
formance. They wowed the crowd and the
judges, though it was anybody’s guess who
would emerge victorious from the two star
groups that evening.

Kappa Delta took home third place at this
year’s Lip Synch for their stylish mix of Brit-

theme, the Chi Psi’s guest appearance of
Jesus and the devil, Sigma Chi’s infamous
Chippendales routine, and ADPi’s swing-
dancing version of “Diamonds are a Girl’s
Best Friend” which closed out the show.
This year’s Lip Synch was deﬁnitely one
to be remembered. Rasaq Lawal, member of
the Phi Beta Sigma team, commented that
overall this‘ year’s ' show’ iwiI's""‘rriuch‘ better
than last year” and that “the crowd was viva-
cious and 110% engaged in the eventif’
Diandra Spicak, dancer for Pi Beta Phi,
shared similar sentiments. She remarked
that “you could tell that most of the groups
worked extremely hard on their routines”
and also applauded “all the groups and indi-

viduals that had the guts to participate in Lip 0

Sync. . .it wasn’t easy.” Numerous students
said they particularly loved the house moms’
performance, and hoped that the moms will
pull something together again next year.

Lip Synch, clearly a resounding hit this
year, managed to raise over $7000 dollars,
all to be given to Rockbridge area food pan-
tries and food pantries across the state of
Virginia. It was a positive, energetic, and fun
event that not only provided the W&L com-
munity with some great entertainment for the
evening but also did a lot of good for the rest
of the community.

Crouch tells his audience about tragic optimism: there is hope in the struggle

By Vlctorla Taylor
STAFF WRITER

It’s not every day that a
guest speaker sticks his gum on
the podium or excuses himself
to take a bathroom break mid-
lecture. Nor does every speaker
fuel heated debates and ex-
changes during a question and
answer session.

, Those were just a few of the
unexpected aspects of passion-
ate and accomplished writer
Stanley’ Crouch’s lecture on
Tuesday.

In the lecture, entitled
“Blues for Tomorrow,” Crouch
expressed his belief in what
he calls “tragic optimism,” the
idea that life is hopeful despite
its suffering and struggles.

He has the same view of
African-American and Ameri-
can history. Crouch argued that
the 19th century folk anti-hero
Davy Crockett was the original
gangster rapper, representing
what he feels is a tragic, yet op-

timistic evolution.

“If Davy Crockett was
around today,” Crouch said, “he
would be known as Coon-head
Baby D, King of the Wild Fron-
tier and he would get a record
deal.”

According to Crouch, Crock-
ett’s proudly unreﬁned vulgar-
ity and his anti-aristocratic feel-
ings against European etiquette
created an authenticity similar
to that emulated by today’s rap-
pers. Crouch said the Crockett
of the magazines displayed the
same characteristics that would
today be considered street or
ghetto.

“Crockett knew Who he was,
just what he’d done and just
how hard it’d been,” he said.
“[He] did not need the valida-
tion of the educated elite. He
was rough and arrogantly proud
of it.”

The lecture led to an intense
question and answer session
in which Crouch interrupted
participants and ﬂat-out ar-

gued with seemingly anyone
who spoke. It also emphasized
Crouch’s critical views on Rap
music and culture, which had
not been the main focus of his
lecture.

Professor Marc Conner of
the Program in African-Ameri-
cans Studies, said that the way

and anyone who has read him
or read about him knows this.
While it’s difﬁcult for me, per-
sonally, to listen to someone
be somewhat abrupt with our
students, nevertheless that is
a mode of public discourse in
America, and it is good for peo-
ple to see that.”

questions on Crouch’s view of
Rap music was an “un-produc-
tive direction for discussion”
because of the rather limited
views on rap shared by some
audience members and Crouch.

“His views on rap really con-
nect to his views of American
culture, but the audience didn’t
want to pursue that.”

Although he had his pre-
sentation on paper, some of
Crouch’s most provocative
comments came from his fre-
quent asides, which included an
anecdote about asking a child-
hood friend who stole ‘cars if he
ever worried if someone would
take his University of Los An-
geles textbooks from the back-
seat. Crouch even took a stab at
Washington and Lee.

“Named after George Wash-
ington and Robert E. Lee,” he
said. “One of them was great
and one of them was who he
was.”

Conner said that the event
itself was very productive and

that the students did a great job
in asking questions and express-
ing their disagreements.

“Yeah, he irritated some
people,” he said, “and yeah, he
made some points which many
people did not seem to agree.
But a university needs to bring
people like this to its campus.
That’s the point of a liberal
education, to encounter other
views and have to wrestle with
them.”

Crouch writes a weekly col-
umn for the New York Daily
News and has published two
novels in addition to numer-
ous essays. The lecture was
sponsored by the Program in
African-American Studies, the
departments of art, history and
politics, University Scholars,
Onyx, Contact and the Oﬂice of
the Dean of Students.

Wrestling falls to  

Johns Hopkins

Generalslose to Blue Jays, 24-
I 8, Saturday despite winning
ﬁve of] 0 weight classes

By Jacob Ellum
smrr warren

Despite jumping out to an early lead, the Washington
and Lee wrestling team lost a hard-fought match Satur- \
day to Johns Hopkins by the score of 24-18.

With the win, the Blue Jays improve their record to
4-6 overall and 2-3 in the Centennial Conference. Mean-
while, the Generals fall to 3-5 overall and 1-3 in con-
ference play. W&L is now ranked seventh out of eight
teams in the conference.

Posting early victories for the Generals were ﬁrst-
years Ben Ersing and Sam Campbell at the 125 and 133-
pound weight classes, respectively. Ersing won his match
against ﬁrst-year Adam Stevens 5-l while Campbell
defeated ﬁrst-year opponent Mike Testa 8-3. This gives
them 11 wins a piece on the season.

After suffering two loses at the 141 and 149-pound
weight classes, the Generals came back in the 157 and
174-pound weight class. First-year David Dennis pinned

“[ We] were more prepared than we

probably ever have been for a match. ”

Mike Bennett, assistant coach
 

JHU opponent William Selba in 4:16, and junior Jon
Brown was able to secure a victory over Mike Keane by
grabbing a quick 2-0 lead with a takedown. In the end
Brown was able to hold off Keane by a 3-2 win.

In the 285-pound weight class, senior captain John
Christopher was defeated JHU sophomore Matt Rugani

‘ in the ﬁnal match of the day by a score of 3-2.This dead-

locked battle was broken by Christopher ﬁrst posting a
quick escape and takedown to jump out to an early 3-
0 lead. He was then able to fend oﬁ‘ a strong comeback
by Rugani long enough for the time to expire. Despite a
strong ﬁnish by the Generals, pins at both the l84ia"nd
197-pound weight classes were too much to overcome.

In the end, winning ﬁve out of the 10 weight classes
was not enough for the Generals wrestling team; howev-
er, W&L assistant coach Mike Bennett was quick to bring

out the positive aspects of
0' the match by examining one
of the tougher matchups of
the day. He pointed to the
one—point loss by sopho-
more Justin Welch to JHU
senior opponent Mike Vec-
chiollo that could have tied up the match, showing how
close the match actually was.

With the loss W&L has lost eight straight matches to
the Johns Hopkins squad.

Bennett went on to say that the team “came out fired”
and that the Generals “were more prepared than we prob-
ably ever have been for a match.”

It will be important that they continue to wrestle with
this intensity when the Generals travel to West Virginia
Tech on Saturday. The Generals return home on February
11 for their last home match of the year against the Ap-
prentice School in the Doremus Gymnasium.

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Sunday’s Recession Bowl

Super Bowl XLIII feels effects of recession, decreased spending

By Will Dorrance
sponrs EDITOR

As I sit down to write this ar-
ticle, it is Saturday afternoon and
I am anxiously awaiting the Super
Bowl tomorrow. You will not see
these words I write until at least
Monday afternoon, the day after
the big game. I write this article
in the future tense, but you will
read it in the past.

In an effort to avoid looking
like a fool, I am not going to make
any predictions for Sunday’s big
game. I have no clue which
team will win. What I do know,
however, is that this year’s NFL
championship will not be as ex-
travagant as most. _

Amid a deepening economic
crisis, the Super Bowl is feeling
the effects of the recession. Typi-
cally, the Bowl is not so much
about football but rather an ex-,,
cessive display of American im-
moderation. But this year will be
a little different.

This is not to say that there
won’t be expensive television ad-
vertisements, widespread media
attention or an electrifying half-
time performance. I’m sure that
Bruce Springsteen will still rock
Raymond James Stadium pretty
hard come intermission.

My point is that in these eco-
nomic times, everyone—individ-
uals, corporations, governmental
agencies, and even the NFL—is
having to cut back on spending.
The Super Bowl will still be a big

deal, but I don’t think it will be

quite as over-the-top.

Fans, for example, are not able
to afford usual Super Bowl ticket
prices. The declined demand
for tickets has driven the prices
down. The cheapest tickets to Su-
per Bowl XLIII went for $500 as
compared to $700 last year—the
ﬁrst price cut in Super Bowl his-
tory.

Although approximately
100,000 people were expected to
travel to host city Tampa, Fla.,

Approximately 200 less journal-
ists will be present_ at this year’s
NFL ﬁnale on Sunday.

The city of Tampa also has not
been able to devote as much mon-
ey to the big game as the host city
usually does. Tampa mayor ‘Pam
Iorio said that she was only able
to budget $40,000 to decorate the
city. “In these tough times, it’s
very hard to justify spending a lot
of money to spruce up the city in
an artiﬁcial way in a short-term

Typically, the Bowl is not so much about foot-

ball but rather an excessive display of Ameri-

can immoderation. But this year will be a little

diﬂerent.

for the Super Bowl weekend, nu-
merous hotels in the area still had
available rooms.

While NBC is still charging a
ridiculous amount of money for
advertising, many Super Bowl
commercial regulars, including
General Motors, Ford, Chrysler
and FedEx, did not purchase air-
time this year. They simply can-
not afford it.

Moreover, Playboy and Sports
Illustrated, companies that are
both known for extravagant Super
Bowl parties, will be hosting no
such events this year.

Media outlets are also having
a difﬁcult time funding the usual
amount spent on the Super Bowl.

The job market is global.
You should be too.

way for the Super Bowl,” Iorio
said.

A study conducted by ﬁnancial
analysts PricewaterhouseCoopers
estimated that the city of Tampa
would rake in just $150 million
from Super Bowl XLIII, which is
22.3 percent less than Glendale,
Ariz., did as last year’s host city.

The NFL has denied that the
recession will impact the Super
Bowl festivities, but I do not see
how this is possible. The league is
undoubtedly feeling the negative
effects of the recession. In fact,
Goodell announced in December
that the NFL will be laying off 10
percent of its employees because
of these rough economic times.

Reid Sigmon, the executive
director of the Tampa Bay Super
Bowl Host Committee, had a little
more realistic outlook. “No one

is immune [to the recession], not

the NFL or the Super Bowl or the
host committee,” he said.

In addition to the recession,
the lack of big-market teams in
the Super Bowl might also be cur-
tailing the game’s allure. Accord-
ing to a 2007 Forbes ranking, the
Pittsburgh Steelers have only the
16th highest net worth among all
NFL teams while the Arizona Car-
dinals are 23rd. This compares to
last year, when the undefeated
New England Patriots, who were
ranked with a net worth of third,
met up with the New York Giants,
who Forbes ranked eighth, in Su-
per Bowl XLII.

Obviously, this year’s NFL
championship has ‘less of a po-
tential to rake in the big bucks
because neither team has a huge
market. Additionally, the reces-
sion will further hinder Sunday’s
big game from being the kind of
moneymaker that Super Bowls
usually are.

Despite all this, nearly 100 mil-
lion people will still watch Super
Bowl XLIII. And I will happily be
one of them even without some of
the hoopla that usually surrounds
the Super Bowl. Maybe now we
can actually focus on something
that the recession won’t change:
what happens on the ﬁeld. After
all, isn’t that what really. matters?

The Washington & Lee men’s basket-
ball team fell to Randolph College 60-63
in a heartbreaking overtime defeat on Sat-
urday.

After a Wild? player knocked down
a foul shot with .5 seconds remaining in
the extra frame, senior point guard Isaiah
Goodman drove the length of the court
and launched a desperation three-pointer
just outside of the top of the key, but the
shot did not go down.

This game marked the Generals’ sec-

erals were down just six points after the

slow start, but the team remained stuck in
neutral as the Wildcats pushed its lead out
to nine points with about nine minutes left
to go.

One of the major differences in this
year’s squad has been its balance with
ﬁve players averaging at least eight points
per game. Hutchinson reiterated this point
and said depth has been one of the key
factors for thesuccess of the Generals.

“We don’t know who is going to have
the big night or who is going to make
the big play,” said Hutchinson last week.
“We have eight guys that have been will-

“We don ’t know who is going to have the big night or who

is going to make the big play. We have eight guys that

have been willing to carry the load at various points this

season, and we seem to have a feel for who has the ad-

vantage and when to go to them. ’

Adam Hutchinson, head coach

 

ond loss of the week after the team stum-
bled against the ODAC’s ﬁrst—place team
Randolph-Macon on Wednesday. Head-

‘ ing into the battle against Randolph-Ma-

con, W&L received national recognition
from the Division III Top 25 poll by get-
ting three votes. Coach Adam Hutchinson
acknowledged that the praise was a nice
step for the squad but did not want the
team to lose sight of its goals.

“The guys were really excited to re-
ceive votes for the top 25,” said Coach

Hutchinson. “I was really happy to see '

their hard work recognized that way. We
have to understand how ﬂeeting that is
though, and we have to stay focused on
the games in front of us.”

Unfortunately, on Saturday afternoon,
the Blue and White just did not have the
answers for Randolph in the waning mo-
ments of the game.

At the outset, the Generals were hot
from three-point land, sinking four of
them to give the home team the early
12-9 lead. W&L extended that lead’ to
eight points when Goodman hit a three
of his own, making the score 24-16 with
roughly nine minutes left in the ﬁrst half.
However, Randolph was not deterred and
inched its way back to narrow the deﬁcit
to four points at the end of the ﬁrst break
for a 32-28 score.

Unlike the ﬁrst half when W&L was
seemingly hitting everything from beyond
the arc, the Generals came out cold in the
second frame; the team did not hit its ﬁrst
ﬁeld goal until about 10 minutes had gone
by. And, just like in the first half, it was
senior forward Kirk Jones who opened
the scoring with a three-ball. The Gen-

who has the advantage and when to go to
them.”

On Saturday, it was senior forward
Ben Heller’s turn as he carried the team
down the stretch to mount a comeback.

With less than six minutes to play, Heller
grabbed an offensive rebound on three of
ﬁve possessions by W&L and cleaned up
the garbage each time with a layup. Then,
with 2:42 left, Heller was fouled while
driving from the top of the key and sank
both shots from the charity stripe to give
the team a 48-47 lead.

But the lead was short-lived as Ran-
dolph went on to hit a ﬁeld goal and then
a foul shot in consecutive trips down
the court. Again, it was Heller who hit a
clutch foul shot with 37.8 seconds which
ultimately sent the game to overtime as
the score was knotted at 51.

In the extra stanza, the Generals start-
ed the same way they did in the second

half as the team missed its ﬁrst few shots.

Randolph capitalized on the slow start
and built a ﬁve-point lead with three min-
utes remaining. Eventually, it was Heller
who brought the team back within two
points and then junior forward Zac White
evened the game at 60 apiece.

However, on the next play White
fouled a Wildcat player who took advan-
tage of the free shots. Randolph then hit
another free throw and won the game as

‘Goodman missed the coast—to-coast run-

ner for three as time expired.

The W&L men’s basketball team is
now l2-6 overall and 5-4 in conference.
The team will next go on the road for
three critical conference games. First up
is a 7:00 p.m. match-up with Emory &
Henry on Wednesday.
