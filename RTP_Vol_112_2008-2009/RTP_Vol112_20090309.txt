Law school gets  
$2 rn.for new
curriculum

The donation from law school alum
John Huss will support a new hands-
on approach for third-years

By John Henderson
NEWS EDITO R

The Washington and Lee School of Law has received a $2 mil-
lion gift from John Huss, a W&L law school alumnus from the class
of 1965, to support the new third-year curriculum which puts stu-
dents through real-world legal simulations to provide a transition
between school work and legal work.

“John’s extraordinary gift comes at a critical time in the history
of the law school,” law school Dean Rodney Smolla said, according
to a recent university news release. Smolla said in the inaugural
year of the program, which will begin in the 2009-2010 academic
year, one-third of the faculty will join with judges and practitioners
from top law ﬁrms to create these real-world simulations.

“John’s gift will help ensure that this new program will be abso-
lutely ﬁrst-class in every respect,” Smolla said.

The program is an unprecedented step away from the traditional
law school curriculum, which focuses on classroom instruction, ac-
cording to the new release Instead, third-years will have the chance
to interact with clients and develop the skills necessary to practice
law. All third-year students in the program will be required to ob-
tain a Virginia practice certiﬁcate.

At the same time, these students will be immersed in a year-long"
professionalism program consisting of legal ethics, civility in prac-
tice, civic leadership, pro bono service, and law ﬁrm economics.

' “We are at a turning point in the history of the legal profession
and the history of legal education,” Smolla said in a message to the
community regarding the new program.

Smolla said law schools nationwide have followed the Harvard
Law School’s curriculum for the past 100 years, developed by Dean
Christopher Columbus Langdell, which teaches legal theory, rea-
soning and doctrine. While this model is apt preparation for ﬁrst-
years, it does not completely prepare students for the law profes-
sion, Smolla said.

Now, law schools are recognizing the need to revamp their style
of education to prepare students for the real world, Smolla said.
“At Washington and Lee, we are proud to be a leader in this na-
tional movement. We believe it is incumbent on our Law School to
be more ambitious in our mission and innovative in our approach
to education,” he said.

The recent $2 million gift will go toward clinical activities and
technical and administrative support for the new program, accord-
ing to the news release It will also fund faculty positions and visit-
ing professors.

Law professor Mary Z. Natkin, law school class of 1985, has
already been promoted to Assistant Dean for Cinical Education and
Public Service. The school has also brought in Virginia Supreme
Court Justice Donald W. Lemons and criminal defense attorney
Judy Clarke'to help teach the new simulation courses.

The law school has also announced the addition of James E. Mo-
litemo to the faculty. Molitemo, a leading educator in experiential
learning, designed the ethics, skills and professionalism program at
William and Mary’s law school.

Elections, 2009

New oﬁcers vow to uphold transparency and accountability

Bylamie Kim
STAFF WRITER

Transparency and account-
ability were two dominant
themes during the Executive
Committee (EC) and Student
Judicial Council (SJC) elec-
tions this year, in which Eric
Hoffman, Scott Centorino,
Bill Larson, Crighton Allen
and Caitlin Cottingham have
all won positions. The elected
will take up their new positions
spring term.

In the March 3 elections
and March 4 runoff, second-
year law student Hoffman was
elected EC president, sopho-
more Centorino was elected
EC vice president, ﬁrst-year
law student Larson became
EC secretary, sophomore Al-
len was voted in as the SJC
chair, and junior Cottingham
was elected SJC secretary.

The campaigns leading up
to the election featured color-
ful posters and ﬂyers distrib-
uted throughout the commons,
speeches, Facebook groups
and numerous emails sent to
student organizations, friends
and friends of friends.

“The posters were fun to
look at,” said sophomore Alex
Sweetser, who said it was help-
ful when candidates visited the
sorority houses.

“They were very witty,”
said sophomore Rasaq Lawal,
referring to the see-through
signs symbolizing transparen-
cy created by Denis O’Leary, a
candidate for EC president.

“I thought it was ‘a very
tight race as far as the presi-
dential bracket goes,” he
added. “It was exciting to see
a potential African-American
EC president.”

The race for EC president
came down to a runoff on
March 4 between Hoffman and
senior Aaron Toomey.

“I deﬁnitely put a lot of
effort into the election,” said
Hoffman. “It pretty much
dominated my life for about

two weeks. It was pretty ex-
hausting, but it was also great,
meeting new people and talk-
ing about issues I care about
that related to W&L.”
Emphasizing the impor-
tance of transparency during
his campaign, Hoffman said
the EC would have regular
meeting times, inform students
of their ability to come to the
EC to discuss any issue or con-
cerns related to the university,
and create a regular dialogue
with the Phi and the Trident.
Beyond transparency, he
plans to work on various is-
sues related to student life,

next year. “

Kenneth Hopkins, another
candidate for EC president,
said the election created new
challenges because he was ad-
dressing the entire school, not
just his class. Hopkins who
currently represents the class
of20l0 plans to run for his seat
next year. “It would be great to
ﬁnish college doing something
I enjoy,” he said.

Centorino said he got
through the stressful cam-
paign-period with help from
his fratemity brothers.

“Campaigns, on any level,
should never be left to one

“I would really like to increase student

awareness for who we are, what we do

and how we can start to be seen as less of

a punitive body and more a resource for

I

students. ’

Crighton Allen, SJC chairman-elect
 ‘

such as Traveller, student self-
governance, student relations
with the Lexington Police De-
partment, designated tailgate
areas at home football games
and student turnout for athletic
events.

“I can’t say all of those
ideas would be successful, but
at least we will create a dia-
logue on these and other issues
to improve student life,” Hoff-
man said.

Hoffman has served as the
law school’s class of 2010 rep-
resentative for the last year.

“I think the biggest differ-
ence with being president will
be the time commitment and
representing the EC and the
student body to the faculty, the
administration and the Board
of Trustees,” he said. “I’m
deﬁnitely up for the challenge
though, and am excited for

person because they can eas-
ily tum into a self-serving,
monolithic conquest,” he said.
“I like always having people
around me, giving me feed-
back, bringing me down to
earth. The great thing about
the campaign is it that it really
helps you see the big picture
all over again and it helps you
remember why you ran for the
EC the ﬁrst time.”

Centorino said he enjoyed
going out and talking to stu-
dents about the issues they care
most about on campus, such as
sexual assault, the health of the
honor system, the administra-
tion and the Greek system.

“While it is important to
master the technical side of
closed hearings and the bud-
getaiy process, it’s also impor-
tant to always keep in mind the
people you’re representing and

their much bigger concerns,”
he said.

Allen, who is currently
serving as the sophomore jus-
tice on the SJC, said his fore-
most goal for the SJ C next year
is furthering R. E. Lee’s notion
of individual responsibility for
one’s actions.

“I am not sure that some
in the W&L community fully
understand what the SJC is and
what kind of cases we handle.”
he said. “I would really like to
increase student awareness for
who we are, what we do and
how we can start to be seen
as less of a punitive body and
more of a resource for students
with questions about the stan-
dards of conduct they are ex-
pected to uphold.”

Alongside Allen will be
Cottingham, currently the law
school’s class“of 2010 repre-
sentative, as the new SJC sec-
retary.

“The other current SJC
members were a huge help
with the campaign, especially
on the undergraduate side,”
she said. “My new role as sec-
retary will involve more logis-
tics and planning hearings.”

To EC secretary-elect Lar-
son, maintaining a strong
relationship with the W&L
community continues to be an
important goal.

“I have enjoyed and felt
honored to serve as the ﬁrst
year law representative this
past year,” he said. “The EC
secretary has more responsi-
bilities. I look forward to the
challenges ahead and working
to improve communication be-
tween the EC and the student
body.”

Current EC President Rich
Cleary said some of the ofﬁ-
cers’ previous experience on
the EC and commitment to
the Honor System will serve
them well, “as they uphold our
esteemed traditions of honor,
integrity and student self-gov-
ernance next year.”

Toni Locy offers a lesson in ethics

Locy defends the right of journalists to use government insiders, but warns of the risks

By Jessica Strait
STAFF WRITER

When journalism professor
Toni Locy was a reporter for
USA Today, she refused to re-
veal her conﬁdential sources in a
federal court case, believing the
law was on her side.

“I thought the First Amend-
ment of the Constitution would
be enough to protect me,” said
Locy.

It did not. Locy was ﬁned
$5,000 a day to compel her to
reveal her sources, and the court
banned her employer and family
members from helping her pay.

Locy did not budge, and sev-
eral days layer a higher appeals
court put a stay on the ﬁne. Locy
shared her unique experiences
with an audience of students and
faculty last Friday as the keynote
speaker for the 47th Institute on
Ethics in Journalism.

Journalism department head
Brian Richardson introduced

Locy as a journalist who protect-
ed her sources and made tough
decisions to provide the public
with the information it needed.

Locy, a veteran cops and
courts reporter who has worked
at the Washington Post and U.S.
News and World Report, remem-
bers the “palpable fear” in Wash-
ington that came after the 2001
anthrax attacks.

“The two and a half years af-
ter 9/ll were the most intense in
my career,” said Locy, who was
working at USA Today at the
time. She recalled the “highly
charged atmosphere” of the
country following the terrorist
attacks.

Of the thousands of stories
she has written in her career, two
stories that weren’t even front-
page scoops were the cause of
her trouble.
several months after Attorney
General John Ashcroft named
Steven Hatﬁeld a “person of in-
terest” in the anthrax attacks.

The stories came I

Locy found the accusatory
term suspicious and in best jour-
nalism fashion started to dig.
She said the term is used even
more today, usually when there
is a lack of evidence. ’

with ulterior motives from those
sources who have reliable infor-
mation.

Locy defended her record as
an accurate and fair reporter who
did her job by questioning those

“I worry that editors and publishers will avoid

covering tough stories...Journalism is in dan-

ger of being destroyed out of fear ’

Toni Locy, journalism professor and keynote speaker

 

Following Ashcroft’s an-
nouncement, Locy relied on
sources that included some 12
people in the FBI and Justice
Department.

Locy argued that journalists
need government insiders now
more than ever, but must be
careful about the sources they
use. She warned students in the
audience to follow their instincts
and separate the “pretenders”

in power and informing the pub-
lie of what the government was
up to. _

“I did my job and I did it
well,” said Locy. “Everything I
wrote was true.”

Locy said her sources were
upset when Ashcroft targeted
Hatﬁeld, and spoke to Locy be-
cause they wanted to help cor-
rect the inaccurate reporting that
was going on at other papers.

In her stories, Locy ques-
tioned whether Hatﬁeld, who
was on 24/7 surveillance at the
time, should be the FBl’s sole
focus.

Hatﬁeld was later cleared and
the man who was apparently be-
hind the attacks, Dr. Bruce Ivins,
committed suicide before being
formally charged.

Hatﬁeld promptly ﬁled a
privacy act lawsuit against the
government in 2003, in which
U.S. District Judge Reggie Wal-
ton called on Locy to reveal the
conﬁdential sources she used in
her stories. When she refused to
give up the names of her sources,
Walton imposed the $5000-a-day
ﬁne.

Before the ordeal, Locy said
she didn’t believe in shield laws,
which protect journalists from
revealing sources. Now she sup-
ports them and spent last week
testifying in front of Texas leg-
islators on a shield law that is up
for consideration in that state.

“I worry that editors and pub-
lishers will avoid covering tough
stories” due to the possibility of
a lawsuit against news organiza-
tions, Locy said. “Journalism is
in danger of being destroyed out
of fear.”

Locy’s talk was well-attended
by students and faculty from the
journalism department as well as
participants in the Ethics Insti-
tute, including a polling analyst
for yhe Washington Post, report-
ers from the Virginian-Pilot, the
Richmond Times-Dispatch and
the Roanoke Times, and CBS
news correspondent Bill Whit-
taker. ‘

“I think her comments about
conﬁdential sources are impor-
tant,” said junior Alex Eichen-
baum. “You’re not only protect-
ing your own credibility but also
the credibility of others. If you
give up one, who’s to say you
don’t have to give up all? It kind
of opens a ﬂood gate.”

The frat bubble myth

Allen responds to last weeks complaints that frats don ’t mix

Crlghton Allen
co LU M NIST

Diandra Spicak, in last wcck’s
Ring-Tum Phi, wrote a piece
calling for a “popping of the frat
bubble.” She writes that Greek
men tend to isolate themselves
within their fraternity once they
pledge and that there is a subse-
quent “dcmolishment of friend-
ships created before joining a
certain Greek organization.”

While I agree with Ms. Spi-
cak that to a certain degree, some
friendships forged during the fall
of freshman year may wither
away as individuals that joined
different houses fall into their
new friend groups, I disagree
with her most strongly when she
alleges that W&L suffers from a
problem of a “frat bubble.”

To be fair, she wrote her col-
umn when many freshmen men
are in the throes of New Member
Education, a process designed to
bring together a pledge class that
may be comprised of guys that
prior to pledging the same frater-
nity did not know each other.

Many fraternities encourage
their New Members to eat meals
together and spend any free time
that they may have with their new
pledge brothers so‘ as to get to
know each other better, so I can
understand how she may have
come to her conclusion.

However, she goes onto elab-
orate that she sees a “lack of in-
ter-fraternity relations” and that
a remedy to this perceived prob-
lcm may be “a smaller number
of frats.” In this, Ms. Spicak is
wholly incorrect.

I believe that if she could
see the Greek system from an
upperclassman’s perspective, she

would see that W&L does not
suffer at all from a frat bubble,
quite the opposite, in fact.

W&L’s vibrant Greek system,
with a wide variety of different
fraternities and sororities, serves
as a distinguishing factor that
gives our school its own distinct
personality and separates it from
many other similar small liberal
arts schools that it may otherwise
very closely resemble.

The large number of frater-
nities here at W&L ensures that
for men choosing to join a Greek

boundaries that may be erected
by Greek afﬁliation.

This sense of community
comes from W&L students’ near
universal respect for the Honor
System, the Speaking Tradition,
and of importance of active par-
ticipation in the many the differ-
ent facets of school life.

W&L students gain friends
from the sports they play, the
clubs the join and the classes
they take. The friendships W&L

. students make from these other

activities are not magically ter-

T he large number of fraternities here at W&L

ensures that for men choosing to join a Greek

organization, there is almost certainly a house

that ﬁts their needs and personalities.

organization, there is almost cer-
tainly a house that fits their needs
and personalities. If the number
of fraternities were diminished,
many men that would otherwise
be Greek may be denied that op-
portunity.

But back to her overall point
that W&L men tend to cloister
themselves within their fraterni-
ties. I give Ms. Spiack my per-
sonal assurancc that there is not
one Greek here at W&L, male or
female, that does not have many
close, intimate friends outside
their own Greek organization.
While I myself love my fraternity
brothers as much as the next guy,
some of my best friends here are
from different fraternities or not
Greek affiliated at all.

W&L possesses a sense of
community that transcends any

minated because the teammates
or classmates pledge different
houses.

Back when I was a young pup
touring colleges, I was struck by
something my W&L tour guide
said as we strolled through the
campus. He said, and I can still
remember his exact quote, “Ev-
ery party at W&L has a guest list,
the student directory.”

Fraternity parties, often
viewed as the dastardly institu-
tion that fosters Greek exclusiv-
ity, do the exact opposite here at
W&L. Every student is welcome
at any Greek party; I myself am
always warmly greeted by my
friends in other fraternities when
I attend their parties and am al-
ways glad to see them when they
attend mine.

Ms. Spicak writes that she

views “a sense of bitterness some
ﬂats bear towards" other frats.”
While it is undeniable that dur-
ing Rush Week, there are some
bruised egos when a coveted
freshman guy decides to join one
house and spum the others that
rushed him, these feelings are
ﬂeeting and certainly do not lead
to lasting animosity that prohibit
inter-fratemity friendships.

Greek life is huge here at
W&L, no question. Yet, on the
other hand, it is not. While large
numbers of W&L students have
a Greek aﬁiliation, most students
here possess the objectivity to re-
alize that a fraternity is really not
that big of a deal.

They are smart enough to
recognize they are no cooler
than someone else because of
Greek aﬂiliation. You could be
the sweetest, fratiest bro ever to
grace Windfall Hill or the most
iconoclastic, vehemently anti-
Greek student here; something
as simple as a fraternity does not
deﬁne how you are characterized
here at W&L.

Unlike many schools, I think
W&L has, just like the real
world, a deemphasized View of
the importance of fraternities and
their meaning. Here, students
are judged by inﬁnitely more
important standards here than
the letters above the door of the
house they belong to, standards
like character, intelligence and
personality.

I love the Greek system here
and think it a wonderful thing for
our school. However, the value
I place in the institution comes
not from the institution itself,
but from the friends I have made,
friends that reside in every single
house on this campus.

We just don’t date here

Aleisha Butler wonders why our school thinks couples are the weird ones

By Alelsha Butler
C 0 L U M N IS T

An upperclassman girl walks
past a group of freshmen girls
who she knows well as they dis-
cuss the newest guys in their lives.
Overhearing their conversation,
she stops to chat. One freshman
girl in particular has an upper-
classman guy interested in her,
and the older girl asks if they ’re
dating. “I don ’I really know, " the
younger girl responds, “we just
hang out at parties and go back
to his room or my room. ”

"Well, ” the older girl says,
“have you guys gone out to din-
ner or anything yet? ”

“N0, ” the first-year answers.
"Everybody says that people
don ’t really date here. ”

“That is what everybody says, ”
the sophomore girl agrees, “and
people here say that I ’m hard on
guys, but I think that  you’re
hooking up with a guy he should
at least be buying you dinner. ”

Here at Washington and Lee
we are infamous for “not really
dating.” Having participated in
my fare share of give-the-number,
go-to-dinner, see-how-things-go
dates in high school, I was dumb-
founded by the way that guys and
girls interact when I ﬁrst arrived
here as a freshman.

It seemed illogical to me that
people would try to get to know
each other in dark, ear-splitting,
alcohol-soaked environments un-
til I realized that no one is really
trying to get to know other people
in those settings. Sober at most
parties of freshman fall term be-
cause I played volleyball, I was
recurrently embarrassed when
saying hello to someone on cam-
pus who clearly had no recollec-
tion of our introduction the night
before. I quickly discovered that
good friends are (soberly) made
in donns, d-hall and classrooms,
and afterwards become better

friends through the escapades of
weekend adventuring.

People spend their weekends
looking for some good unac-
countable ﬁin, and don’t appre-
ciate being reminded of their
behavior in the sunlight of the
following day. However, this
setup spells death for romantic
relationships, as most people at
our school use any and all free
time for blowing off the steam of
the workweek.

People are so busy escaping
from the stress of schoolwork that

ing, but as a whole we conform
to the perceived gender norms of
our school’s social scene and do
not demand a more mature, re-
spectful environment.

Why do we continue to con-
done each other’s behavior? After
we leave the co-ed environment
of the freshmen dorms, guys’ and
girls’ lives become almost com-
pletely segregated, barring class-
room activity and parties. Both of
these casesVare rigidly structured
social environments that require
extremes of behavior that are of-

It seemed illogical to me that people would try

to get to know each other in dark, ear-split-

ting, alcohol—soaked environments...we forget

what it is like to have a conversation...

they forget the fun and intriguing
challenge of actually dating. It’s
so much easier to get drunk, go
home with somebody and act like
nothing happened the next day.
We get so caught up in the fun
of anonymity that we forget what
it’s like to have a conversation,
an experience, with another hu-
man being. Even when a date is
so bad it should go down in his-
tory as the World’s Worst Date,
it still makes for a more comical
and unique story than the formu-
laic one you can overhear almost
anywhere on campus on a Mon-
day morning. That story usu-
ally starts with: “So I was totally
wasted on Saturday night...”
The biggest problem with ev-
erybody’s commitment phobia is
that it leads to a devaluing of all
male-female relationships. Most
girls on our campus are disgusted
by guys’ lack of interest in dat-

ten unrelated to an individual’s
normal tendencies.

There’s nothing wrong with
cutting loose every now and
then, and there’s nothing wrong
with sexual intimacy between
two mature and compassionate
adults, but there is something
wrong with the myriad deﬁni-
tions of dating that I’ve,heard
frequently around our campus:
four or more hookups and you’re
ofﬁcially “dating,” buying a $40
bottle of wine to give away as a
birthday present or designating a
certain pillow on the bed as “their
pillow.”

W&L students seem to desire
a personal accountability that
stops at the classroom door. We
want to be seen as capable, elli-
cient students and potential em-
ployees, but when the sun goes
down we don’t want to be seen
at all, or only very little. Why

else would we keep the lights out
at parties and dc-tag our entire
Facebook repertoire before ap-
plying for jobs?

Truly dating somebody in-
volvcs seeing and being seen,
observing and being observed,
assessing and being assessed.
Nobody wants to “put themselves
out there” and risk rejection, so
W&L’s wildly permissive social
scene creates the opportunity for
a buffer in which anonymity and
alcohol provide an avenue of es-
cape from potential embarrass-
ment.

Sadly, the Nobody Dates Here
norms of our school create a
cycle that is hard for students to
break out of. Recently one of my
male friends took nearly a week

"to ask a girl out to dinner. He

didn’t have a huge crush on her,
he wasn’t madly in love with her;
he simply wanted to have a good
meal and a good conversation
with a smart, pretty girl.

While he was somewhat wor-
ried about rej ection, he was more
worried that she would think he
was weird, and what is sad about
our social structure is that by our
junior year here, it is strange for
two acquaintances to set up a
casual dimer outing. A lot more
people at our school would feel a
lot more comfortable with mem-
bers of the opposite sex if we
took those Dating Is Fun signs a
little more seriously. Dates don’t
have to be layered with all kinds
of tension and expectations.
They can just be ways to meet
and make better friends.

I’m not saying that every-
body needs to "‘boo-up” and
ﬁnd themselves a future spouse.
Everybody is looking for a little
more respect, so what I’m saying
is that we shouldn’t be afraid to
give it.

Festival hits the right notes

Groups from W&L and other universities featured

By Katherine Roberts
srixrr WRITER

Five student a cappella groups and a crowd
from the Washington and Lee community ﬁlled
the Wilson concert hall on Saturday for the fourth
annual a cappella festival.

The event opened with its host, General Ad-
mission (GA}—W&L’s oldest co-ed a cappella
group. The songs were arranged by Julie Slo-
necki, the group’s musical director. GA started
things off with Lily Allen’s “Smile,” which “al-
ways made us happy to do,” said GA member Jen
Hampton.

“It was really good to have a
couple of visiting groups but

also show more unity among the

3

W&L a Capella scene. ’
Kimber Wlggs, GA acting president

Their most challenging song, acting president
Kimber Wiggs said, was Estelle’s “American
Boy” because “we have so many parts in it. “But
we made it!” said Hampton. They did make it:
“American Boy” made it clear that the members
were having a great time up there. That energy
carried over to their last song, which Wiggs pre-
ceded by telling the rest of the group, “This is the
last one, and we want to make sure they enjoy
it.”

Wiggs sang “Paper Planes” by M.I.A.: “GA,
third world democracy. Yeah, we got more re-
cords than the registrar.”

For their festival debut, the year-old Washing-
tones sang more classic rock. They opened with
the theme from The Ofﬁce, capturing the admi-
ration of the audience. The Washingtones were
obviously having a great time onstage, acting out
the lyrics and pretending they were playing in-
struments. When they sang the 80’s classic “Time
After Time,” they forewent the vocal accompa-
niment common to a cappella and relied instead
on incredible harmonies and experimenting with
the ‘rhythm; their creativity came through in the

, next song as well, a medley of “Stand By Me”
and “Every Breath You Take.” They closed with
“Build Me Up Buttercup.”

The lovely ladies of JubiLee sang next. They
dedicated their ﬁrst song to the one and only
Markheavens Tshuma: “Kiss Me” by the Cran-

berries. I could see Markheavens ﬁ‘o1n where I
was sitting, and he blew a kiss to the ladies. They
followed up their great start with “Bubbly” by
Colbie Caillat and “New Soul" by Yael Naim, “
which showcased their voices. Deep Blue Some-
thing’s “Breakfast At Tiffany’s” was the most
interactive, as the audience recognized it imme-
diately and clapped along.

The festival also showcased two groups from
other universities: The Fading Point from South-
erin Virginia University and The Madison Proj-
ect from James Madison University. There have
been more groups from outside W&L in the past,
said Wiggs, but “this was a year when it was re-
ally good to have a couple of visiting groups but
also show more unity among the W&L a cappella
scene.”

Having the visitors was exciting, said Becky
Guynn, who attended the festival for her second
year. “It’s nice to be able to hear our own groups
but also bring in groups that we might not other-
wise be able to hear,” she said.

For The Fading Point, it was their ﬁrst
time performing at W&L; hopefully, it will
not be their last. As GA member Clarke
Morrison put it, “SVU: domination."
They were so much fun to listen to, but also to
watch. They had impressive choreography; of
course, everyone loves a good jazz square.

“They were amazingly tight, and very enter-
taining,” said Wiggs. “Everyone was great, but
that was just a surprise because we didn’t know
what to expect from them.”

Near the end of The Fading Point’s perfor-
mance, the batteries in one of the microphone
died; while they were waiting for more batteries,
one of the members befriended a man in the au-
dience, Lee Taylor. He had us all cheer for Lee,
and told Lee: “This next song we’re going to sing
is just for fun, but it’s all about you." They sang
Justin Timberlake’s “Cry Me A River.” and incor-
porated Lee’s name into it several times... “Let
me hear you say ‘Lee,’” “Cry Lee." that sort of
thing. That earned them a standing ovation, and
Lee even stood and bowed. _

The group Madison Project found success in
their second-year performance. Their vocal talent
was incredible, and they were so clearly enjoying
themselves. When they sang Chicago’s “You’re
The Inspiration” “Love You Madly” by Cake was
unfortunately the last song of the evening, but the
audience, left laughing and dancing, a great end
to a great night.

Artist uses his work to address issues in the Americas

MORGAN HARRIS / Staff photographer

Dobin-Bernstein's exhibit blends religious iconography and modern day
scenes to create a sense of cultural identity in the Americas.

By Valaree Tang
STAFF WRITER

From January 19 to June 7,
“Saints and Other Sightings,” a
photography exhibit featuring
photos by Noah Dobin-Bemstein,
displays 35 various black and
white and color photographs tak-
en from two ends of the continent
in The Williams School of Com-
merce, Economics and Politics.
The Gallery hours are from 8 AM
to 5PM from Monday through
Friday.

With photographs from Buenos
Aires, Argentina to New Haven,
Connecticut, Dobin-Bernstein’s
photos have been displayed in
three other previous exhibitions.
The pieces range from contem-
porary saint icons along with pro-
tests in Buenos Aires and diners
in New Haven.

The “Saints and Other Sight-
ings” exhibition includes photos
of massive protests and small
movements between friends.
They show the complicated beau-
ty of contemporary lives of two
distinct comers of the Americas.

Dobin-Bemstein recognized
several reasons the saint icon was
created: to glorify a religious be-
lief, to establish a local identity, to
rally masses, to assert authority,
to claim authenticity, to protest
and to sell cards with prayers on
the subway. He hopes that each
reproduction reaffirms the myste-
rious power of these images, ex-
ceptional photographs even trans-
forming these meanings.

The “other sightings” of the
exhibition is a “search for new
character and new ways to tell
stories about contemporary life
at opposite ends of the Ameri-
cas,” wrote Dobin-Bemstein. The
photographs that complement the
saint icons are “not a documen-
tary nor is the angle of [the] lens
very wide. But hanging side by
side, they offer one View of the
complicated beauty of various

twenty—ﬁrst century lives,” wrote
Dobin-Bemstein:

There are a few select pieces
that stand out despite the fact that
none of the pieces have titles. One
photograph features a woman
dressed in dark clothing avert-
ing her eyes toward the camera.
The desperation and hope that is
portrayed through the woman’s
eyes is the main focus of the pho-
tograph. This color work-of-art is
featured on the ﬂyers promoting
the exhibition.

“Saints and Other Sightings” ex-
hibition, and shows the contem-
porary and complicated beauty of
the twenty—ﬁrst century life.

The photographs are on sale
and range from one work at $120,
with most‘ of the pictures costing
$300.

Dobin-Bemstein lived in
Buenos Aires, Argentina for two
years following his graduation
from Yale University. Dobin-
Bernstein, 23, studied under Lisa
Kereszi and David Hilliard and

Yet another color work that
particularly stands out among
the works, is one that presents a
young girl, thumb in mouth, in
a run—down setting. The fact that
such a young person in poverty
can be a saint in her community
is an interesting outlook, and even
transcends the reasons the saint
icon was created.

One color work shows a wom-
an dressed in blue from head to
toe, with her head covered and
standing among columns and pil-
lars. Her hands are in the praying
position, and the woman is a dis-
heartening parallel to some Cath-
olic icons of the virgin mother
Mary.

One black and white photo-
graph uses artistic angles and
features a nude young woman.
Tastefully photographed, the
woman’s face is hidden by the
way her head is angled, with her
knees pulled to her chest and her
breast exposed. This painting is a
part of the “other sightings” of the

ship from Yale to build a dark-
room and teach photography in a
community center rim by Asoci-
atién Civil Engranajes, an Argen-
tine non-proﬁt organization that
uses arts education as a means of
community-building and social
transformation. ,

While in Argentina, the pho-
tographer also worked with a
bakery in Argentina that cooper-
ates with the Unemployed Work-
er’s Movement of La Matanza to
make a bilingual, photographic
cookbook. This cookbook is on
sale at the exhibition and features
black and white pictures that
show bakers working night shifts,
preparing traditional pastries that
they will sell at low prices to ben-
eﬁt the community. Entitled “La
Masa Critical” or “Critical Mass
Bakery”, the cookbook can be
purchased in Huntley Hall Room
205-B for $15.

If you like music and helping peo-
ple, and have no plans for Sunday,
then you should go to the “One Acous-
tic Evening” beneﬁt concert.

The concert features a variety of
solo artists and groups. J. D. Marti-
nez, who has been writing original
songs since the 1960’s is scheduled
to perform. It seems that the concert
has some genuine celebrities in their
lineup. James Leva, the subject of nu-
merous articles in Sing Outl, Acous-

will be performing some of his famed
numbers along with James Tubbs, who
has sung at the National Anthem at the
Pentagon.

Washington and Lee will be rep-
resented by a number if its own or-
ganizations. The Catholic Campus
Ministry chorale will lend their di-
vine voices to charity for the evening.
Their program is comprised of a num-
ber of songs sung in Creole, the lan-
guage of Haiti. They are directed by
Josh Harvey, who also directs Joyful
Noise Gospel Choir, also scheduled to
perform. Some familiar W&L groups
such as the Washingtones, Rikki Tikki
Tavi and Agent Flynn, will perform
folk and classic rock.

The Washingtones were most re-
cently seen in W&L’s a capella festi-
val where they were met with grand
applause. '

Rikki Tikki Tavi and Agent Flynn
both successfully competed in this
year’s Battle of the Bands.

Local bands Jonathan Vassar &
The Speckled Bird and Generation
Gap will also be performing.

Finally, the concert features the
headliner Gary Ruley and Mule Train.
Gary Ruley is one of the best ﬁatpick-
ing guitarists in the Shenandoah Val-
ley, and has released ﬁve CDs.

There will be many types of music
to enjoy, from country and gospel to
folk rock to blues and bluegrass, and
even some new grass. It’s like a mu-
sical buffet, with a lot to sample and
enjoy.

The concert supports ongoing relief
efforts in Haiti, which was severely
damaged by hurricanes Fay, Gustav,
Hannah and Ike during last summer.
Some of the eﬁbrts include building
a school, constructing a church estab-
lishing a medical center, and aiding
Ebenezer Orphanage.

W&L joins the Lexington commu-
nity in supporting and aiding the hurri-
cane survivors. The medical clinic ini-
tiative is co-sponsored by Lexington
Presbyterian Church and St. Patrick’s
Catholic Church. The concert is co-
sponsored by The Caribbean Society,
Catholic Campus Ministry and the Of-
ﬁce of Religious Life. A

Tickets are $10 or two for $l5, and

W&L loses ﬁrst game 

Women is lacrosse falls to number two F &M 11-9

By Will Dorrance
spoars EDITOR

Heading into Saturday’s
game against Franklin & Mar-
shall (F&M), the Washington
and Lee women’s lacrosse
team was ranked eighth in all
of Division III, according to
the Intercollegiate Women’s
Lacrosse Coaches Association
(IWLCA).

Unfortunately for the Gen-
erals, F &M is one of the seven
teams ranked ahead of them.
W&L was unable to pull off
the upset of the 2007 nation-
al champions, losing a close
game to the second-ranked
Diplomats, 11-9.

The Generals entered the
game 3-0, having outscored
their opponents 43-18, but
Saturday was a different story.

W&L did get out to an
early lead on a goal 1:47 into
the game from junior attack-
er Meredith Freeman. The
Generals’ initial lead was
short-lived though as F&M’s
ﬁrst-year midﬁelder Lauren
Ehrhardt scored just over a
minute later. W&L answered
back when senior attacker Ka-
tie Flippen scored just under
four minutes into the game to
put the home team up 2-1.

However, the Diplomats
began to take over from that
point on, outscoring the Gen-
erals 6-1 over the rest of the
first half. W&L did see some
offensive opportunities but for
the most part failed to put the
ball in the back of the net.

Robinson said the team
remained upbeat going into

halftime. “Knowing that we
still had thirty good minutes
of lacrosse to play, everybody
was on the same page that we
were still in this game and that
we had nothing to lose by just
going out there and giving it
our best.” M

Down 7-3, W&L came
out ﬁring to start the second
half. The Generals scored
four straight goals over a six-
minute span to tie the game at

S€V€I'l.

After calling a timeout once
the Diplomats took the l0-9
lead, W&L lost the draw, and
F&M did not tumover the ball,
running out the last three min-
utes on the clock. The away
team also added an insurance
goal with three seconds re-
maining to claim its second
win of the season in as many
attempts.

W&L was paced by Free-
man’s three goals and one as-
sist to give her 10 goals and two

“Although we clidn ’t win, we playecl a

great game. F &M is tough competition,

and if anything, we proved to ourselves

that we continue to belong at the top of

our division. 

Katie Flippen, senior attacker

F&M senior attacker Jen
Pritchard, a 2008 ﬁrst-team
All-American, scored her ﬁrst
goal a minute-and-a‘-half after
W&L tied the game.

But sophomore midﬁelders
Emmy Mathews and Wilton
Megargel teamed up to score
two goals in 40 seconds to put
the Generals back on top.

Pritchard, Lacrosse Mag-
azine’s 2009 Division III pre-
season Player of the Year, then
scored with both ten minutes
and three minutes remaining
to take back the lead that her
team would never relinquish.

assists on the year. Pritchard
led the Diplomats with three
goals and one assist.

Despite Pritchard’s statis-
tics Saturday, Freeman thinks
W&L’s defense played well
against the All-American.
“She is a very dynamic ath-
letic player, and we were ex-
pecting her to be a constant
threat. I think we did a great
job neutralizing her and forc-
ing F&M to show us that they
have more than one dynamic,
athletic player on the ﬁeld,”
said Freeman.

Robinson echoed her team-

mates’ comments regarding
Pritchard. “We deﬁnitely
knew she’d be one of their
major threats. She obviously
had a good game, but I think
we did a good job of not let-

.ting her dominate. She’s usu-

ally their main threat on draw
controls, and we deﬁnitely
took that part out of her game
on Saturday.”

Just as the team has been
doing all season, sophomore
Katharine F arrar and ﬁrst-year
Jennifer Linder split time in
goal. Farrar started the game
and surrendered seven goals
while making seven saves.
Linder gave up four goals in
the second half and made two
saves.

Having barely lost to last
year’s national ﬁnalists, Free-

man thinks that W&L is con- '

ﬁdent moving forward. “It
shows us how far hard work
and preparation can take us,
and our near-win just gives us
an incentive to continue work-
ing hard and pushing each oth-
er in practice, so if/when we
see F&M again, the outcome
will be a little different,” she
said.

Flippen summed up Sat-
urday’s game, “Although we
didn’t win, we played a great
game. F&M is tough com-
petition, and if anything, we
proved to ourselves that we
continue to belong at the top
of our division.”

Now at 3-1 on the year, the
Generals next travel to Freder-
icksburg, Va., Saturday to take
on Mary Washington in a 2:00
p.m. game.
