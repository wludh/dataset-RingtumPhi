What is an

ombudsman?

Clark Hoyt of the New
York Times explains his
role of upholding the
standards of the Times

By Jessica Strait
STAFF WRITER

Public Editor and Pulitzer-Prize winner Clark Hoyt
gave his audience an inside look at his job as an om-
budsman for the New York Times—one who receives
and processes complaints directedat the paper—and
shared what he has learned in his 42 years as a reporter
and editor on Friday. I

Hoyt was the Keynote Speaker for the 46th Institute
on Ethics & Journalism, held every year as a chance
for distinguished visitors to gather for the weekend to
discuss ethics in the journalism profession.

Hoyt explained his role as a “shock absorber” for
readers who are critical of the Times. His job is to
investigate issues readers ﬁnd fault with and respond
in a column he writes three times a month.

On a busy day, he receives 2,000 messages from
readers. Many complaints often deal with readers re-
acting to a story they found biased or exaggerated.

While Hoyt works for the Times, he is not techni-
cally an employee. As an ombudsman, Hoyt is not
allowed to be employed by the Times before, during
or after having that job.

“I have an independent contract, no boss and no job
description,” he said.

Hoyt explained there was controversy over where
to place his ofﬁce when the Times moved buildings,
because, as he said, “No department wanted to be near
me.” The solution was to place him near the wedding

“I believe society needs and will al-
ways value news that good journal-
ists produce...‘I don ’t know the future,
but that is the opportunity for young
people today. ”

Ombudsman

announcement section. .

“I like my neighbors,” Hoyt joked.

While Hoyt’s job description is to berate report-
ers and their stories in his column, he said that overall
his reception at the paper has been professional and
cordial if occasionally unfriendly. Hoyt said his job
of holding the newspaper to its own high standard of
journalism far outweighs any chilly treatment he_ re-
ceives. He is the Times’ third public editor, a position
that was created following the Jason Blair scandal,
which involved a reporter fabricating stories.

The audience was very attentive to Hoyt as he
spoke honestly of mistakes the newspaper has made
that could have been prevented with some more re-
search. He also discussed recent events, including the
election and readers’ habits of accusing papers of hav-
ing political biases.

“Another bias of newspapers is that stories wash by
quickly and we don’t go back to things,” he said.

He amused the audience with anecdotes from his
work at the Times. Hoyt said a French journalist once
sent him a story to run (in French), and one reader
sent the Times a $20,000 bill for all the Opinion Edi-
torial articles he had sent over the years that had been
rejected.

“My job is always educational,” he said.

Hoyt addressed the concerns of the ﬁnancial crisis
and the hard times facing newspapers. He said recent
job cuts mean fewer reporters are keeping watch of
public institutions. While there is still demand for
journalism, the future is unclear, Hoyt said.

“I believe society needs and will always value
news that good journalists produce,” he said. “I don’t
know the future, but that is the opportunity for young
people today.”

Hoyt followed with a Q & A session with the audi-
ence. The Institute on Ethics and Journalism began
Friday morning and continued through Saturday af-
ternoon. ‘

Weekend of thefts

Break—ins occur at Kappa Alpha and an apartment

Bylamie Kim

The honor system is a deﬁning

' aspect of life at Washington and

Lee, and most often it is respect-
fully observed by the community
members. But sometimes, students
rely too much on the honor system
and become targets when people
outside the Washington and Lee
community choose to violate that
trust.

On the night of Saturday, Nov.
1, students at Kappa Alpha frater-
nity were having a party downstairs
while some people were in their
rooms upstairs. Sophomore Mar-
shall “Skip” Wood was upstairs
when he heard people talking about
things being gone.

“I walked into my room and
found that my backpack and other
things were missing,” he said.

He came back out into the hall-
way and noticed someone carrying
a backpack that looked like his.

“He quickly left, and I called the
security,” said Wood. “I found my
backpack downstairs behind a trash
can. It seemed like he hid it there
and was going to pick it up later.”

Local police later caught the
thief in a car that was parked on
Massie Street. The thief was Jesse
Steven Warren, a 19-year-old from
Georgia, according the police re-
port.

Sgt. M. E. Huffman said in his
report that he and other police of-
ﬁcer were patrolling the Massie
Street area when they found Warren
sitting in a car with his hood over
his head.

“We stopped and asked him
what he was doing,” said Huffman.

E

“He stated that he was tired and go-
ing to go to sleep. We asked if it
was his car and he stated that it was
a friends’ vehicle.”

Detecting a strong odor of al-
cohol, Huffman then had Warren
come out of the car.

“Upon search of the suspect,
multiple cell phones and iPods
were found in his pants pockets,
along with money and other items,”
Huffman said. I asked him if all of
the cell phones were his and he stat-
ed that one belonged to his brother
and another to his wife and that one
was his.”

Haddow said.

Although all stolen things were
returned to them, members of KA
were quite startled by this incident,
Haddow said. To their knowledge,
it had never happened before.

“Some of them started to lock
their doors, and we had our broken
doors ﬁxed by the school,” he said.
“We’re now being more aware of
who is coming into the house.”

“We have always had a dozen is-
sues a year with theft,” said Public
Safety Director Mike Young. “Most
often it is people outside the com-
munity who steal. We’ve had theft

“I was sur rised...I’m rom New Jerse , so I ’m
P 3’

used to locking the doors and not leaving any-

thing inside. But in Lexington, you don ’t expect

things like this to happen. ’

Bethany Ridenhour, senior

1

Warren later confessed that he
had taken the items from a party he
was attending. Wood said Warren
was at a party at another nearby fra-
ternity house, after which he came
to KA and walked inside and stole
the items.

Another KA, brother Carson
Haddow, was also one of the vic-
tims of the burglary. He said most
people at the time did not pay much
attention to Warren, thinking he
was another W&L student.

“We thought he was somebody
we didn’t know because we had a
party downstairs from 10 to 12,”

of things from the library and laun-
dry room at the end of the year. We
occasionally have thieves at work
because they know that our students
aren’t very aware of security.”

Having a good sense of secu-
rity is especially important because
even keeping doors locked does not
necessarily prevent theft, Young
said.

Senior Bethany Ridenhour, a
resident of the Parkview Apart-
ments near the Lenfest Center, said
some of her personal items were
stolen from her ‘car on Thursday,
Oct. 30. After coming back from

‘basketball practice the day before,

she made sure the car was locked
before going inside her apartment.
But when she got back to the car
next morning, she realized some
things were missing.

“I usually leave my iPod and
wallet in my car, and I noticed
that my IPod and certain cards and
money were taken away. I reported
to the police, but they said the odds
of getting anything back weren’t
much,” said Ridenhour. “I was sur-
prised. I’ve never had anything sto-
len before. I’m from New Jersey, so
I’m used to locking the doors and
not leaving anything inside. But in
Lexington, you don’t expect things

like this to happen.”

Young cautioned students
against being too lax about their
security.

“Because we have an honor code
here, people have a false sense of se-
curity. They really believe they can
have their doors unlocked,” Young
said. “But in reality, they can’t. If
they unlock their doors, people are
going to come in because they can.
[W&L] is certainly a better place
than other places, but people still
need to be aware of their security.”

Dean Brandon Dotson shared a
similar view with Young. Although
most people in the W&L com-
munity follow the honor code and
respect each other, there are those
outside the school who can easily
violate the community of trust.

“I strongly recommend that stu-
dents practice good decisions when
it comes to safety. If you ﬁnd some-
one suspicious, report to security,”
said Dotson. “We live in a real soci-
ety where crime is just as prevalent
as anywhere else.”

Students sleep in shelters for the hungry and homeless

Initiative builds tents from recycled materials, students sleep on Colonnade to raise homelessness awareness

; The Colonnade’s hallmark red-
brick-white-column facade was
the stage for the biggest, and ar-
guably most profound, event dur-
ing Washington and Lee’s Hunger

For ﬁve days, students seeking

growing national problems set up

.gOne in three homeless people
in the United States are afflicted

.with a mental illness, according

to Neely Myers, a doctoral candi-
date at the University of Chicago.
Myers spoke last Monday to a
small group of students and facul-
ty members as part of Hunger and
Homelessness Awareness week.
Her speech, entitled “Psychi-
atric Disability Homelessness and
the American Institutional Cir-
cuit” spoke to the cyclical rela-
tionship between mental disease
and homelessness. V
Psychiatric disability ranges

pecially at this time of the year,
warm clothing to people living on
the streets.

“We get a lot of good feedback
from homeless people when we
do it,” O’Brien said. “They ap-
preciate it when people go out of
their way to help them. At the end
of the day, everyone likes to be
cared for and listened to.”

It was this positive response in
D.C. that got O’Brien so involved
in the campus movement to in-
crease awareness.

Aiming to accurately repre-
senting homelessness, O’Brien
worked with the head of W&L’s
recycling facilities, and con-
structed the tents entirely from re-
cyclable materials found around
campus, from leftovers at Facili-
ties Management to scraps from
Leybum Library construction.

But in perhaps the boldest at-
tempt to truly convey the spirit
of homelessness, O’Brien said
he chose not to obtain the admin-

from depressionvto schizophrenia.
Myers addressed several intercon-
nections between homelessness
and these mental diseases.

The lack of community sup-
port services for those suffering
from mental disability contributes
towards homelessness, Myers
said. [

With no healthcare support,
those facing the deleterious ef-
fects of a mental disability cannot
obtain the necessary medicinal
solutions. Individuals may turn to
self medication, including drugs,
alcohol and other coping mecha-
nisms. These choices give rise to
perpetuation of crises.

istration’s permission to make - ment, which is what I was trying

camp along the Colonnade.

“l was... aware that because
of the placement, it was unlikely
that the administration would
give advance permission,” he
said. “When you think about the
reality of homelessness, homeless
people don’t have permission to
[be where they are].- They occupy
a space, and sit where they sit un-
til they get kicked out.” ,

O’Brien said they were fully
ready to move the display if need
be, but it never came to that.

“It did feel nerve-wracking
going into it, but it was a case of
no response is good response.”

During his time “living” on
the Colonnade, O’Brien said he
noticed a very encouraging reac-
tion from passers-by.

“The thing that made me feel
positive about it is, there were a
few people who turned up and
said, ‘Where can I sign up?’
There was quite a bit of excite-

Individuals are further af-
ﬂicted with emotional, physi-
cal and mental troubles. With a
lack of housing, those on shelter
wait lists enter the streets, mental
diseases increase in likelihood of
striking, and the cycle of negative
interconnected forces perpetu-
ates.

The American institutional cir-
cuit is the support from shelters,
hotels, streets, jails and the emer-
gency psychiatric ward. Howev-
er, these supports fail to address
the needs of those experiencing
homelessness, Myers said.

On the positive side, shelters
provide a warm space, bathrooms

to generate.”

Linnea Bond, one of the Col-
onnade campers, described her
experience as truly eye-opening
and certainly humbling.

“It was really uncomfortable,
my back hurt every day,” said
Bond. “It rained the ﬁrst night...
and as 1 walking through the com-
mons I could smell myself. I was
kind of embarrassed.”

Through all this, though, Bond
says she felt she did a good thing
as far as raising campus aware-
ness.

“People seemed a little sur-
prised, maybe confused at ﬁrst.
There was some negative atti-
tude... but I think people really
noticed and the majority of peo-
ple thought it was interesting. It
was impossible not to be affected
in some way.”

Jenna Walls, General Chair
of Nabors Service League, com-
mended the creativity and effec-

and meals. Despite this, there are
high crime rates, increased risks
of communal disease, noisy liv-
ing and no storage.

As an alternative, the streets
may provide some sense of com-
munity. However, they force in-
dividuals to stay up at night and
sleep during the day, with no
bathroom or shower capabilities.
There may be freedom of choice
to live on the streets, but there
is an incredible risk of danger in
making that choice.

The homeless have an in-
creased likelihood of emotional
distress when living on the insti-
tutional circuit. This distress per-

tiveness of O’Brien’s living dis-
play.

“The major thing [we were]
trying to convey is that we go
to such a prestigious and ‘such a
well endowed university and be-
ing in the Lexington area we. . .are
in a bubble,” said Walls. “Elliott
wanted to make a statement...by
putting [the display] directly on
our Colonnade inside the bubble
we live in every day.”

“I think it deﬁnitely got across
and we were really happy with
it,” she added.

However, Walls said, getting
the events of the week started was
an uphill battle.

“The ﬁrst major thing we had
to concentrate on was the ﬁnan-
cial commitment,” said Walls.
“That took a bit of work making
sure we had the money in our
budget.”

The money was used to bring
in and host members of the Urban
Ministry Center out of Charlotte,

petuates as an inability to escape
the effects when medical treat-
ment is unavailable.

When asked about a compre-
hensive solution to homelessness,
Professor Harlan Beckley, direc-
tor of the Shepherd Poverty Pro-
gram, said, “To deal with issues
of healthcare and public health

,are_vcritical...I think that some

sort of housing policy is deﬁnitely
part of it.”

The lack of affordable housing
and adequate healthcare are the
main instigators of homelessness
and its negative effects, Myers
said. She suggested several indi-'
vidual solutions to the range of in-

NC. According to their Web site,
the Center’s mission is to address
the needs of the homeless with
“love, compassion and tangible
help.”

Visitors from the Center in-
cluded some of their staff, as
well as some formerly homeless
people.

“They gave us a great human,
personal perspective on this is-
sue,” said Robbie Turner, advisor
for both the Bonner Leader Pro-
gram and Campus Kitchens.

Though Turner was not di-
rectly involved in setting up the
events of the week, he offered
support to the students who had
a hand in coordinating the aware-
ness efforts.

“It was a phenomenal week,”
he said, “and really hopefully re-
minded us all of...these issues,
and how we can work to alleviate
the suffering caused by them.”

   Doctoral candidate makes comparison to mental illnesses

terconnected problems, including
supported employment housing,
an adjustment of the Social Se-
curity Disability Index, universal
healthcare, anti-stigma campaigns
and an increase in funds for non-
medical treatment programs.

Inadequate solutions fail to
ameliorate the effects of home-
lessness inhibit complete eradi-
cation of the epidemic. Myers
stressed the need to address the
interconnections between pov-
erty, homelessness and mental
disability.

Honorable and
very vulnerable

Just because we don ’t steal doesn’t
mean thieves can ’t come to Lexington

Time for another conversation on the failures of the honor sys-
tem. But this time it’s something serious.

On the weekend of Nov. 1, a 19-year-old from Georgia stole sev-
eral cell phones and iPods from the Kappa Alpha fraternity house
during a party, and another student reported an iPod, money, and
cards stolen from her car parked near her apartment.

Later that week a security guard said that a student returned to
his car in the Woods Creek parking lot to ﬁnd a stranger sitting in
it.

As students following the precious honor system, we assume that
none of our belongings will ever go missing, just because Robert E.
Lee told us that gentlemen never lie, cheat, or steal. We are even
told as visiting high school students that the beauty of the honor
system is that we don’t ever have to lock our doors, and we can
leave our‘ valuables lying around on campus and they will still be
there days later.

Can we really be that trusting?

Sure, I know students never lock their dorm rooms, and most
of the time, everything is safe. But an unlocked car in a parking
lot or garage gives free access to anyone. Can you imagine leav-
ing your car unlocked in any big city? Your stuff——maybe even the
car——would likely be gone in minutes. -

Leaving your laptop in the library might be ﬁne for an hour or
so, but how do you really know? Students may not know this, but
Public Safety reports that valuable items are stolen from the library
every year.

And frat parties where everyone and anyone can walk in from
the street? Be careful, guys. If you’re having a party in your base-
ment, it can’t be that hard to lock your rooms upstairs. You might
have been lucky so far, but you’ll regret it next time if your iPod—
or laptop or camera or cash——is ‘missing in the morning.

With such an open attitude on this campus, we’ve deﬁnitely been
living under a false sense of security. And thieves looking for an
easy break-in know how careless and unaware our students can be
when it comes to protecting our belongings.

The honor system doesn’t extend to the outside community.
We may think W&L and Lexington are safe, but we don’t live in a
walled city. Lock your cars, keep your stuff safe. Don’t be the next
one to be taken advantage of.

Welcome to the USSA

Stockton Bullitt shares his predictions for the future

By Stockton Bullltt
C 0 L U M N I ST

After November 4, I saw
plenty of Republicans walking
around campus with worried
looks.

Now that they live in a blue
town, in a blue state, with a blue
Senate, blue House, blue Presi-
dent, and what could be in a
couple of years a blue judiciary,
they look quite, well, blue. But
please, do not fret Reagan-lov-
ers. As a consolation prize, I
thought it would be nice to share
with you the Democrats’ real

’ plan for the next four years that

we have been devising since Earl
Warren died.

Most of the good stuff will
happen in the ﬁrst 100 days be-
cause we Democrats like doing
things in l00—day increments
since it makes us feel like Na-
poleon. We will renege the deci-
sion of Prop 8 in California since
it obviously was not really done
democratically and will hurt the
sales of the new movie “Milk.”

We will make sure that abor-
tion is held up when Judge Rob-
erts is mysteriously killed in a
freak accident that also takes
out Karl Rove and Dick Cheney.
Chief Justice Hilary Clinton will
read the Constitution like an

English teacher, that is focusing
on the themes and main ideas as
opposed to what it actually says,
which as well all know is irrel-
evant. But do not worry, we will
not outlaw guns as Joe Biden
continues to remind people. Bul-
lets, on the other hand, are quite
out of the question. They can
hurt people, and Democrats do
not want feelings, let alone body
parts being injured.

Democratic Senator Zell
Miller did an outrageous thing
at the 2004 RNC when he told
all you Republicans that Kerry
planned to arm the troops with
spitballs. We should never have
let him in on the secret. Luck-
ily, we sent Joe Lieberman into
your camp as a spy on the Me-
Cain campaign. I mean, he is
from New England, what did
you expect? And if you don’t
like to abide by this War on Bul-
lets, we will send PETA mem-
bers to your hunting sites, and
you wouldn’t want blood thrown
on your hunting gear and pickup
trucks, would you?

Finally, since the ACLU now
has enough of a voice in the
government, it will be now be
legal to yell “Fire” in a crowded
room due to free speech, just as
long as you do not say “God” or
“Jesus.” On that note, we will

replace “One nation under God”
in the Pledge of Allegiance
with “One Nation under Barack
Obama” or “One Nation under
hope.” We do not want to offend
the atheist eight-year—olds in el-
ementary school, and we will be
nice enough to let you, the peo-
ple, decide whether it should be
Barack Obama or hope. And we
will allow Southern statehouses
to have the Ten Commandments
shown on their property, of
course as long as they are jux-
taposed with scripture from the
Qur’an.

Yes, you got us, Barack
Obama was sent here by terror-
ists. Don’t let the fact that he is
from Kenya, which was bombed
by Osama Bin Laden in 1998,
fool you. We gave you all the
signs (his middle name, Jeremi-
ah Wright, Bill Ayers), and you
still could not pick that up. We
Democrats, having no guns, will
gladly welcome in those terror-
ists as liberators. Since even ter-
rorists deserve a voice, we will
spend a great deal of time lis-
tening and evaluating what they
have to say, while Kim Jong Il
invades from the west. ,

But don’t you worry, that
won’t happen for a while. First,
we need to ﬁx the economy. And
what better way to ﬁx the econ-

omy then with a ﬁxed economy?
Yep, that’s right, Socialism!
Obama will increase your taxes
as McCain regretfully pointed
out, but he never said how much.
Your 100% tax will help the state
and our glorious country; at least
that’s how Comrade Obama ex-
plains it. And you wondered why
we had so many posters with
Barack’s face on them. That was
because everyone is going to
need an Obama poster in their
house, preferably over their din-
ing room table, a la Stalin and
Mao. Speaking of Mao, we will
be sure to help literacy in the
classroom by giving everyone
a nice Little Blue Book, which
will be The Audacity of Hope but
in a smaller, paperback version.
Don’t worry; you can still get it
on tape.

So, get excited Republicans!
While your senior year here in
Lexington will now involve be-
ing allocated to whatever job
best suits your ability or what-
ever jobs best suits the country’s
need, you can still enjoy yourself
in neighboring cities when the
Democratic initiative changes
Richmond into Sodom and Roa-
noke into Gomorrah. Hope you
don’t feel too blue about having
a donkey represent your country.
Yes we can!

An open letter to the next president

Barack shouldn ’t forget that the youth are inheriting post-Obama America

Bylacob Geiger
COLUMNIST

Dear Barack,

Should we call you President
Obama? Or can we still call you
Barack?

Anyway, congrats on the big
win. I know you must be pretty
happy that you won a higher
percentage of the popular vote
than any Democrat since Lyn-
don Johnson knocked off a
curmudgeonly old senator from
Arizona in 1964. That’d be Bar-
ry Goldwater, not John McCain,
by the way.

I know you’re busy celebrat-
ing your victory, hiring advisors
and picking out a new puppy for
your daughters, but I wanted to
offer you a bit of advice from
the young voters who helped
push you into the White House
Tuesday.

You won about two-thirds
of the votes from people age
18-29. We only make up about
20 percent of the electorate,
but there are more of us than

Guerilla activists

Beauchamp likes the Colonnade bums

By Cody Beauchamp
OPINIONS EDITOR

This week, my pleasant
daily walk to Tucker was in-
vaded by bums.

In case you didn’t go any-
where near the Colonnade this
past week, a number of stu-
dents basically turned it into
the hobo-ﬁlled underside of an
urban bridge.

It was a bold visual ﬂour-
ish, precisely because it made
us comptemplate homeless-
ness in a very ‘in-your-face’
way.

Our beautiﬁil Colonnade
was marred by the mock
homeless.

That is to say - in the most
beautiful, idyllic spot on cam-
pus, a very real social problem
reared its ugly head.

Wow. That’s provocative.
Poetry, really.

Of course, I’m sure I’ve
irritated all of those guerilla
activists by throwing around
words like ‘bum,’ ‘hobo,’ etc.

That’s hardly respectful,
I’ll grant.

But it’s how most of us
think about the homeless, if
we’re really honest with our-
sevles.

there are people who are 65 and
older.

That’s pretty impressive.
But I hope you’ll remember that
35 percent of us didn’t vote for
you. As you govern in the next
four years, try to win some of
that 35 percent over. You’ll
never make everyone happy,
but at least you’ll do better than
George Bush, who made every-
one unhappy.

' So as you start laying out
your policy agenda for the next
four years, don’t forget that you
owe us. We’re the ones who
helped make this possible.

Your ﬁrst priority, obviously,
is to ﬁx our nation’s economy.
The stock market has dropped
below 9,000 from its high above
14,000 last year. Wall Street
titans like Bear Steams and
Lehman Brothers are extinct.
Consumer spending last month
suffered its biggest drop in 30
years. Unemployment is rising.

We know that government
spending is going to be a key
part of helping us out of the re-

cession. We know that means
running up a budget deﬁcit
that could reach $1 trillion next
year.

But here’s the catch. As the
Treasury Department starts
throwing billions of dollars
around, try to remember that
you’re sticking us — the peo-
ple under 30 — with that debt.
You’re sticking your cute little
daughters with that debt.

If you’re going to run up a
massive debt, at least invest in
some badly needed infrastruc-
ture investments. That means
more roads, more money to ﬁll
potholes and work to replace
bridges that are starting to show
their age. That means improve-
ments in our nation’s rail net-
works, including right here in
the Shenandoah Valley, to move
tractor-trailers off the road and
onto trains.

You’re also inheriting two
wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Nearly 5,000 Americans have
died in those two places. Most
of them were our age, our gen-

eration, our friends. Many of us
want to see them come home
— soon — but I think all of us
want to make sure those 5,000
friends haven’t died in vain.

There are plenty of other
problems that I haven’t touched
on. We could talk about global
warming, social security, health
care and a bunch of other prob-
lems.

But as you lead the nation
as our ﬁrst African-American
president, remember that we’re
the ones who helped make this
possible.

We’re the ones who will have
to pay off the incredible debts
our government is running up.
We’re the one watching friends
and classmates go off to war.
We’re the ones who may have
to deal with the effects of global
warming.

Govern for everyone. But
remember that we’re the ones
who will be around the longest.

Thanks,
The under-30 crowd

And that’s part of why the
demonstration was so effec-
tive, I think.

I was upset when I ﬁrst saw
the unsightly - asthetically un-
appealing - shelters students
were sleeping in.

I wasn’t happy that my very
pleasant daily activity was be-
ing invaded by ugly reality.

But then I thought that
maybe that’s the point.

At Washington and Lee, we
live in a bubble.
We’re pretty socioeco-

nomically sheltered, on top of
spending most of our time in
either beautiful historic build-
ings, palacial Greek houses,
or at ‘trashed,’ ‘party—houses’
that are in reality better hous-
ing than most people in Lex-
ington have.

We don’t do much to help
the needy as a campus, and I
think it’s in part because we
can always escape from the
reality that the less fortunate
even exist.

Usually, we can escape
back into our BMW’ed, Ralph
Lauren’ed, future I-bankers-
bubble.

Usually. Not last week

letter to the editor

Classy concession I

College Republicans say congrats

Dear College Democrats and Senator Obama,

On behalf of the W&L College Republicans, we congratulate
you on this historic victory. When Martin Luther King Jr. delivered
his ‘I have a dream’ speech on the steps of the Lincoln memorial,
this must have been the moment of which he spoke. There can be
no doubt of the magnitude and signiﬁcance of this election. We
congratulate not only your party, but the country, in its ability to
change.

It would be easy for us to fall to the temptation and use this mo-
ment to say how cyclical politics is and that we will be back, but we
will not. This is your moment. You have deserved our respect.

None of us will ever forget this election. It teaches us to believe
in things we thought were impossible and to believe in ourselves
as Americans.

Of course, some might say our own efforts proved meaningless.
As the College Republicans, we do not regret knocking on a single
door. We do not regret a single phone call or a single yard sign
posted. We are proud of our campaigning and proud of yours. To
all on this campus who stand on principles, whichever principles,
win or lose, you are all great Americans.

In its name, Washington and Lee University recognizes two
such Americans, who fought for ideals. One man won. One man
lost. However, loss is not without pride and victory is not without
cost. Today, we must recognize that victors do not have exclusive
ownership of greatness, but neither do they have exclusive own-
ership of responsibility. Republicans everywhere must now get to
work, never surrendering the idea of America to petty political par-
ties. We both have too much at stake to hold political grudges.

It would be wrong to say we’re not disappointed, but it would be
equally wrong to say that we do not hope the next four years prove
to be more prosperous than the last four years. America has no (R)
or (D) next to its name. We only ask that you recognize what we
ﬁght for and why we ﬁght. With such graciousness at hand, your
party can govern in a respectful and truly progressive manner.

“With malice toward none, with charity for all, with ﬁrmness in
the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to ﬁnish the
work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for him who
shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do
all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among
ourselves and with all nations.” Abraham Lincoln

With great respect,
Scott Graham Centorino
President, W&L College Republicans.

 

to the editor Ruscio is a good man

Sophomore Christian Roden takes Patrick Bradley - and students - to. task

I hope that Mr. Bradley’s let-
ter of last week (see: “Dear Ken:
Quit Being a Coward), stimulat-
ed a thoughtful and appropriate
response. I can only hope this,
however, because rarely have I
read such a spiteful and vile at-
tack on an individual I have the
honor to know on a personal
basis and whom I respect im-
rnensely.

Mr. Bradley does highlight
the most pressing issue Wash-
ington and Lee faces: gender re-
lations, within both the student
body and the faculty and staff.

No reasonably intelligent
person could say that our cam-
pus does not have a problem.

Our list of shortcomings in
this area is long and depressing-
ly serious, including a regularly
ﬂooded health center (especially
during rush and “Tear Night”
festivities) and disgraceful stu-
dent conduct at events like last
year’s Gender Relations Panel
and this year’s Diversity Panel.

Having acknowledged these
problems, I still feel conﬁdent
enough to criticize Mr. Bradley’s
attack on President Ruscio.

Because I have worked for
President Ruscio for the last year
and a half, I know him to be an
individual most dedicated to the
development of academically
healthy and active students.

In his position, this means
fostering an environment where
students can develop without
worrying about facing warped
views on gender roles.

The problems we have had
on this campus relating to gen-
der relations are of immense

concern to President Ruscio,
whether they be alcohol-induced
rapes at a party, or seemingly
overpowering stereotypes about
women in academic settings.

President Ruscio is not a
coward, nor is he a bully. He is
a thoughtful and deliberate lead-
er, who is only taking his time
because he wants to reach the
best solution that will not have
any unintended negative conse-
quences.

As a student, I am not privy
to many of the disagreements
within the faculty about gender.

1 do know, however, that in
the thirty-ﬁve years since Wash-

that Mr. Bradley is right on one
issue.

Washington and Lee does in-
deed “trumpet its ideals of com-
munity, honor, and civility”, and
yet, has elements to its culture
that are the polar opposites to
any reasonable notion of com-
munity, honor, and civility.

President Ruscio cannot
wave a wand and magically
force this campus to behave.

Our university is structured
so that these issues are student-
governed.

Theoretically, it can be our
greatest strength. Practically, it
is our greatest weakness.

President Ruscio cannot wave a wand and

magically force this campus to behave... The

honor system is only eﬂective as long as...

students are willing to hold themsevles to it...

ington and Lee hired its ﬁrst
woman faculty member, we
have made immense progress.

Some of the most popular
and respected teachers in many
departments, including English,
Art History, Journalism, Phys-
ics, and Studio Art, are women.
The list of women in high rank-
ing administration jobs is long,
including Dean Watkins, Dean
Futrell, and Dean Ikeda. After
President Ruscio took ofﬁce, we
hired our ﬁrst ever female pro-
vost.

Unfortunately, I must admit

The honor system is only
effective as long as the over-
whelming majority of students
are willing to hold themselves to
its high and strict ideals—both
in and out of the classroom.

We cannot call ourselves hon-
orable if we refuse to cheat on a
test, but then seek to have non-
consensual sex with a drunken
individual ‘at the next party.

The best President Ruscio

, can do is to fulﬁll his job descrip-

tion: to foster a healthy environ-
ment for his students. Doing this
means that he must ask students

to be willing to change the sta-
tus quo (or, the way things are, if
Mr. Bradley insists on vemacu-
lar translations).

It’s a time—consuming pro-
cess, one where students must
meet the President halfway.

I will end this with a message
directly for Mr. Bradley, and an-
other for us, the studentibody.

Mr. Bradley, do not criticize
someone unless you understand
his job description. Nor should
you ignore the very real prog-
ress that has been made.

And to the student body:
Shame upon us for letting our-
selves reach a state where some-
one outside the university feels
it is necessary to criticize us.

The local community is
watching us. If we do not live
up to the standards we profess,
how can we ever expect to truly
make a difference anywhere, be
it in politics, our families, or our
local communities?

I ask you to be willing to take
up the responsibility to over-
come the stereotype we have
made for ourselves.

It won’t be easy. . .traditions,
whether good or bad, die hard
on this campus. It takes time for
opinions to change.

If we wish to continue mak-
ing any progress, we have to be
willing to confront this issue,
and accept the responsibility to
act according to our duty: to be,
in every sense of the titles, la-
dies and gentlemen.

Christian Roden, ‘ 11

“Midnight Run” for the homeless

Students from Nabors and Phi Beta Sigma deliver fooal,

By John Henderson
N EWS EDITOR

It is one thing to study
homelessness, attend lectures
and panels on homelessness

parted after 5:00 p.m. in two
cars headed for Washington,
D.C. Some participants had
made the trip before and some
were members of the Nabors

and even sleep in make-shift
homeless shelters on the Col-
onnade---it is quite another to
see the deleterious effects ‘of
homelessness ﬁrst hand and at-
tend to the needs of the home-
less, which is how a group of
eight Washington and Lee stu-
dents and one Lexington resi-
dent spent their evening last
Friday.

Sponsored by the Nabors
Service League and the Phi Beta
Sigma fraternity, the “Midnight
Run” to Washington, D.C. was
a chance for students to get up
close and personal with home-
lessness at the culmination
of Homelessness Awareness
Week. Phi Beta Sigma Vice
President Rasaq Lawal led the
effort with the help of students
from each year and the spouse
of a W&L professor.

The group met at 2:00 p.m.
on Friday in the Chavis house
to prepare food, collect clothes
and blankets to give away and
go over the details of the trip.
The Campus Kitchens Proj-
ect donated buns and leftover
chicken from the dining hall,
which was cut up and used to
make sandwiches. The group
packed bananas, oranges and
bottles of water to complete
the meal.

With food packed and di-
rections printed, the group de-

Service League—others were
new to the midnight run and
had little experience with com-
munity service.

Around 9:00 the cars ar-
rived at the intersection of P
and 22nd streets in Northwest
Washington, where the group
was to meet two natives of
Washington, D.C. who work
with the homeless and were
once homeless themselves.

Jesse and Brian are middle-
aged African Americans who
have similar personal stories of
hard luck and redemption. Jes-
se, a fast-talking extrovert with
a BA in Sociology and a minor
in Urban Planning, recounted
how his untimely divorce
plunged him into depression,
causing him to lose his job as a
systems engineer at AT&T and
take to the streets for four years
as a homeless man.

Brian, a somber man who
talks less, said simply, “My
wife wanted to share things;
I don’t like to share things.
We couldn’t make it work.”
Brian soon found himself on
the streets and in homeless
shelters, before escaping the
“institutional circuit” to work
with Jesse ministering to the
homeless. '

Jesse and Brian’s stories
were not only interesting but
revelatory, defying stereotypes

Homeless art

W&L displays artwork by homeless

By Jean Chapman
STAFF WRITER

As part of Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week,
the same people who brought us the display of lean-tos on the
Colonnade also sponsored an art show in the Commons living
room beginning on Nov. 11. The art on display was created by
homeless men and women who participate in the art program of
Urban Ministries of Charlotte. The artwork is all “outsider art”
meaning that no formal training or instruction is given to these
artists; they are simply given free reign to express through art
the experience of homelessness and share it with the world.

Co-coordinators Elliott O’Brien and Robbie Turner said that
the art display was inspired by the alternative spring break trip
taken by some students in the previous winter term. During the
break, students had an opportunity to interact with the homeless
who participated in the art and soccer programs of the Urban
Ministries. According to O’Brien, this experience inspired the
idea of an art show as part of Hunger and Homelessness Week.
He said that typically they invited a group from D.C. to come
to Lexington as part of this week, but they decided to invite the
group from Charlotte in order to provide the students who par-
ticipated in the alternate spring break trip with an opportunity to
reunite with the people they had met during their time in North
Carolina.

One of these students, senior Mackenzie Brown, said that
she was excited to see the participants again, as well as see their
artwork. Brown expressed particular enthusiasm for one artist,
Frank Hall, whom she had met on her trip to Charlotte and pur-
chased art from, which she says is now hanging in her apart-
ment. She also explained that the art display was being produced
in conjunction with a ﬁlm that had recently been shown in the
Stackhouse Theater, entitled “Kickinf It” which followed events
of the Homeless Soccer World Cup. The Homeless World Cup
draws street soccer teams from around the world, including the
team from Charlotte, and in the ﬁlm also proﬁled one of the par-
ticipants of the Urban Ministries with whom Washington and
Lee students had a chance to interact.

Robb Cann, a representative of Urban Ministries, said that
he became involved in UM through this soccer program. He
was contacted by his brother and was invited to become a soccer
coach for the street soccer team and helped prepare them for the
World Cup. After this experience, Cann became involved full
time. He explained that the purpose of Urban Ministries, and in
particular the art and soccer programs, is to use these activities
as a way to break down social work and increase trust between
the homeless participants and those present to help them. Cann
said that one of the main goals is to form relationships with
the participants and discover the root causes of their homeless-
ness. In order to participate in the programs, individuals work
together with the United Ministries Teams to set both short and
long-terrn goals to help them get out of their current situation.

The program which created the art on display in the Com-
mons Living Room helps the homeless in two ways: ﬁrst, it is
used as a type of therapy for the participants and allows them to
express their emotions and their experience of homelessness to
the world. Second, the artwork is sold, and half of the proceeds
go to support the program, while the other half goes directly
to the artist in order to supplement their income. Aside from
the wonderful program that spurred the creation of this art, the
works themselves are remarkable. Ranging from paintings to
mixed media to photography, the art is evocative, skillful, and
moving. Bright colors, dramatic shadows, snippets of poetry,
scenes both abstract and lifelike, all comprise this art display
which challenges the viewer to understand both the meaning of
the artwork and the experience that provoked it.

associated with homelessness.
The group departed to see the
reality of homelessness with
Jesse and Brian as guides.

The first stop was McPher-

son Square, a public park be-

tween tall ofﬁce buildings two
blocks away from the White
House. Jesse led several stu-
dents down a path to the cen-

V ter of the park to see who was

there, stopping at park benches
along the way to arouse the oc-
cupants with an audible “hel-
lo!” q

The group followed with
the coolers and distributed the
food and clothes as needed.
Some homeless people were
fast asleep and would not be
woken; others got up immedi-
ately and wanted to chat. Most
were polite, well spoken and
friendly. One man sat comfort--
ably on a bench with his legs
crossed and discussed the ef-
fects of the ﬁnancial crisis on
the global economy as a pro-
fessor might do with students
over coffee. .

The group left the cars at
McPherson Square and walked
to another park a few blocks
away, where Jesse introduced
the group to a man he had spent
time with at a nearby homeless
shelter. Jesse explained that as
parks have been restricted and
shelters handed over to devel-
opers, the homeless have been
forced to move into the further
reaches of the city where there
is chronic violence and drug
trafficking.

The group proceeded to a
street where homeless people
were sleeping in, the doors and
alcoves of office buildings. A
group of about ten people slept
side by side under piles of
blankets and other insulating
materials to fend off the com-
ing cold of winter. One man
had used a piece of cardboard
to create a partition with his
neighbor for some privacy.

Further down the street, stu-

dents gave food and water to a
man with scars on his forehead.
Jesse said violence against the
homeless is common, and more
often than not it is caused by
non-homeless passers-by.
_ In a small park at the in-
tersection of two streets, the
group handed out what was
left of the food and clothes to a
group of about a dozen home-
less people. One outgoing man
who identiﬁed himself as Sam
cracked jokes with several stu-
dents and correctly guessed
that one student was Catholic.
Sam wore a cross around his
neck and blessed the departing
group several times.

Having used up the food,
the group headed back to the
cars, dropped off Jesse and
Brian at the church which is
their base of operations and
took a group picture. On the
ride back to Lexington, it be-
came clear what started as a
trip to feed the hungry shifted
perceptions of what it means to
be homeless.

Photo exhibit will chronicle small town in Texas

Photographer Dave Anderson captured the struggle of small rural towns, Anderson to give talk on his new exhibit

By Jean Chapman
STAFF WRITER

Beginning on Nov. 10, pho-
tography by Dave Anderson
will be featured in the Staniar
Gallery, following the exhibit
by Alberto Rey. Anderson’s
photography chronicles through
images the small town of Vi-
dor, Texas. Anderson, a primar-
ily self-taught artist, presents
his collection, entitled Rough
Beauty, which will continue on
display through Dec. 10, 2008.

Anderson collected photo-

‘ graphs of Vidor during approxi-

mately 50 trips there between
2003 and 2006. In all of his
images, Anderson shows the
resilience of the small town in
southeast Texas as it struggles
to create a new identity for itself
out of a difﬁcult past. Vidor, a
town known for generations be-
cause of its history of Klan ac-
tion, is shown in a different light
in this collection. Anderson’s
photography shows the hidden

beauty and the strength of this
community as it deals with a
difﬁcult past and attempts to
renew itself. Rough Beauty has
received international renown,
with acclaim from American,
Canadian, and German media.
This collection has been proﬁled
on NPR, featured on Canadian
television, and has won numer-
ous awards, including winner
of the Santa Fe Center for Pho-
tography Project Competition in
2005.

Anderson has worked full-
time for the past three years as a
ﬁne art and commercial photog-
rapher, during which time he has
been recognized as “one of the
shooting stars of the American
photo scene” by Germany’s fo-
toMAGAZIN. He has also been
named to the top 30 list by Pho-
to District News, placing him as
one of the top emerging photog-
raphers of our era. Anderson’s
work has been featured in many
top magazines including Stern,

ESPN, Esquire, and the British
Journal of Photography, aside
from Photo District News. His
photography has been on display
in various museums across the
United States, most notably the
Museum of Fine Arts in Hous-
ton, the George Eastman House,
the Art Museum of Southeast
Texas, the Worcester Art Mu-
seum in Massachusetts and the
Ogden Museum of Southern Art
in New Orleans.

Anderson will give an artist’s

talk on Wednesday, November
12 in the Wilson Concert Hall
at 6:00 p.m. Afterward there
will be a reception in the Wil-
son Atrium. All are encouraged
to attend the talk and reception.
Anderson will also be spending
a week on campus here at Wash-
ington and Lee acting as Visit-
ing Artist to the Art Department
as part of his stay in the area.

know who the homeless truly
were. Several still held many
mistaken beliefs about what
caused homelessness, who the
homeless are and where home-
lessness is the most prevalent. A
panel addressing this issue was
held Thursday.

The Faces of Homeless-
ness Panel gave the homeless a
voice.

The panel was sponsored by
Nabors Service League. Both
staff and formerly homeless
people from the Urban Ministry
Center in Charlotte, NC were on
the panel.

Those on the panel revealed

several little-known facts about
the homeless. They also correct-
ed several misconceptions about
who the less fortunate truly are.

Roland Washington, a vet-
eran and college graduate, ad-
mitted to being homeless for
several months.

He said, “It was difficult at
that time to ﬁnd a job or ﬁnd
time to ﬁnd an apartment. When
my relationship failed I be-
came homeless for six to eight
months.”

Washington is now a mem-
ber of Homeless Helping Home-
less.

Others on the panel also used
their experiences on the street
to help those who are currently
homeless. Capone, who became

homeless at the age of fourteen,
spoke of the value of his street
smarts.

“I know I am a good
advocate,”Capone said. “I have
lived with the people on the
streets...slept under a bridge,
slept in the woods and slept in
the cold.”

Capone also offered his in-
sight on the association between
drugs and homelessness. Al-
though many students believed
that drug use caused poverty,
Capone had a different story to
tell.

As one of two siblings, Ca-
pone tried to support his family
when his father could not. He
unfortunately had to turn to drug
dealing to earn money for food.

“There were too many of us
and [my father] couldn’t support
us. . .I did the next best thing and
went out at age fourteen to make
money as I best I could...I had
to sell drugs just to get food.”

Although some individuals
became homeless while trying
to support their families, oth-
ers fell into the same situation
because of a lack of family sup-
port.

Jaime Morgan told the audi-
ence about his difﬁculties with
his parents.

“My mom and dad decided to
take my car because they didn’t
approve of me being gay. . .I had
no way to get to work. . .I lost my
job and I lost my apartment.”

However, a failed relation-

I'M THERE”

ship or ﬁlial difﬁculties are not
the only reasons for hard times.
Mental illness is also a leading
cause.

Quinetta Williams said, “My
mother could no longer deal
with my schizophrenic and
bipolar behaviors...I became
completely homeless in 1995.”

Williams was later banned
from a women’s shelter for the
violent behaviors caused by her
psychological disorders.

Liz Clayson Kelly, an em-
ployee of the Urban Ministry,
echoed Williams’ sentiments.

“Homelessness is a social
epidemic,” Kelly commented.
“We know today that it is due
largely to our own [national]
policy on mental health care.”

Despite the array of services
available, some homeless peo-
ple still refuse their help. But,
this is not because of their own
laziness.

Like many others, they re-
tain their pride and sense of
self—worth.

Capone commented, “I
might be homeless, but I am
still picky.”

Williams, like Capone, did
not turn to shelters or homes.

“I would have been one of
the oldest people in an adult
group home,” said Williams. I
refused their help and stayed on
the streets. A lot of people don’t
realize that the homeless work
the hardest.”

3 - THE RING-TUM PHI’

Buena Vista native Charlie Manuel wins World Series

 

CI"%[!?r11_l'_;E5¥' ‘$1.! QUA ?S~’l2#.I‘éll..1'§L’§.

By Wlll Dorrance
SPORTS EDITOR

On Route 60 on the way into
Buena Vista, Va., there is a sign
that reads, “Buena Vista’s Char-
lie Manuel, Manager of the Phil-
adelphia Phillies,” but according
to Mayor Mike Clements, it will
soon be taken down.

The town plans to replace that
sign with a new one acknowl-
edging Charlie Manuel, a Buena
Vista native, as a World Series
champion. .

There is no doubt that Buena
Vista is proud of its most famous
son and his team for beating the
Tampa Bay Rays in ﬁve games
last month. It was the Phillies
ﬁrst World Series crown since
1980 and Philadelphia’s ﬁrst ma-
jor sports championship since
1983.

When Charlie was 12 years
old, he moved with his parents
and 10 siblings to Buena Vista
from Grayson County, Va. His
father, Charles Sr., became pas-
tor of the Buena Vista Pente-
costal Holiness Church, and the
Manuel family lived in a parson-
age a few houses down from the
church.

As a child, Charlie, or “Fook,”
as he is known in Buena Vista for
his middle name Fuqua, was al-
ways loved to play sports. He was
often seen playing football with
his brothers in their back yard,
practicing his baseball swing at a
nearby ﬁeld, or shooting a ball at
make-shift baskets in the church

. parking lot. As he got older, he

would run the eight miles from

his house to Virginia Military
Institute, sometimes barefoot,
to play pick-up basketball.
Charlie Kurtz, Manuel’s
baseball and football coach at
Parry McCluer High School,
emphasized his former play-
er’s work ethic. “He was a
kid that grew up swinging
sticks at rocks. He developed
a love for sports. He was
willing to put in the time to ef-
fectively become an outstand-
ing player in sports. He was a
hard worker. He knew what it

As Manuel told the News-
Gazette of Lexington, “In
Buena Vista, when I was a
kid, you could always ﬁnd
a baseball game, and I always
found it. During the summer
I’d play in four or ﬁve different
leagues.”

The hard work began to pay
off at Parry McCluer where Man-
uel was a three-sport star, eam-
ing all-district honors in football,
basketball and baseball multiple
times. He was captain of the bas-

took to defeat the other man.” '

scored over 1,000 points.

A former teacher at Parry Mc-
Cluer, Francis Lynn, recognized
Manuel’s talent from a young
age. “You sort of knew that his
athletic abilities was just superi-
or to the rest of the students who
came along at that time. He was
just a natural athlete who took it
very, very seriously.”

In 1963, in the middle of
Charlie’s successful senior year,
his father, who suffered from di-
abetes and heart trouble, passed
away.

Kurtz remembered a game
the day of Charles Sr.’s burial.
“I told him, ‘We could do sev-
eral things: We can cancel the
game; you don’t have to come.’
He said, ‘Nope. I’m going to
the ﬁeld, and we’ll play.’ I said,
‘Okay.’ He hit one of the longest
home runs he ever hit in high
school that day. And his com-
ment as he rounded the bases and
came home was, ‘That was for
Daddy and Momma.”’

June Manuel, Charlie’s moth-
er, was left to care for the eleven

“[ Charlie Manuel] was a kid that grew up

swinging sticks at rocks. He developed a

love for sports. He was willing to put in the

8 time to effectively become an outstanding

player in sports. He was a hard worker. He
knew what it took to defeat the other man. ”

Charlle Kurtz, Manuel’s hlgh school

ketball and baseball teams and a
two-time MVP in baseball.
Manuel was known for his hit-
ting abilities, especially his great
power. Kurtz recalled Manuel’s
abilities to win games with his
bat. “He carried the team on his
back quite a bit with his stick.”
Although he made a career
out of baseball, basketball was
his ﬁrst love and probably his
best sport as a child. He made
the varsity basketball team as a
freshman. In one game he scored

‘42 points, and he grabbed 38 re-

bounds in another. During his
entire high school career, Manuel

Manuel kids by herself. W. A.
Mills, pastor of the Buena Vista
Pentecostal Holiness Church for
the last 12 years, was very close
to June Manuel in her later years.
He applauded her approach to
raising her children during this
difficult time. “She would‘ have
been eligible for welfare or food
stamps, but she opted out of any
of those programs, and her at-
titude towards life was her sons
were old enough to get part-time
jobs after school hours, and with
them working and with her pray-
ing, they would make it. And
they did. She did a tremendous

job at keeping her family togeth-
er.”

A basketball and baseball
standout, Charlie Manuel had
many different options following
his graduation from high school
‘in 1963. According to Mills,
“The day he graduated from Par-
ry McCluer High School, there
were nine recruiters waiting for
him at his home.” He was be-
ing recruited for basketball by
schools like the University of
North Carolina and Davidson
College and was even offered
a basketball scholarship at the
University of Pennsylvania.

Instead, he elected to support
his family ﬁnancially, signing
with the Minnesota Twins for a
$20,000 signing bonus. Manuel
later told the News-Gazette,
“$8,000 was up front, and I was
to get the additional $12,000
if I spent 90 days in the major
leagues. I had to wait six years
for the rest of that money.”

His ﬁrst stop in the minor
leagues was Wytheville, Va., in
the Appalachian rookie league.
Manuel’s early professional ca-
reer was full of ups and downs.
After one poor season in the
minors, he even contemplated
leaving the game, but his former
high school coach talked him out
of it. In a 1986 interview with
the News-Gazette, Manuel said,
“Charlie Kurtz saved my ca-
reer.”

Playing for the Wisconsin
Rapids, Manuel rebounded in
1967 to hit for the Midwest
League triple crown. The next
year, he batted .283 with 35
home runs and 80 RBI. His per-
formance that season earned him
an invitation to the Minnesota
Twins’ spring training in 1969.
He made the team and became
the ﬁrst area high school gradu-
ate to play in the major leagues.
In his ﬁrst at-bat, he hit a home
run.

The Twins, however, had a lot
of outﬁelders, including all-stars
Bob Allison and Tony Oliva, so
Manuel did not receive much
playing time. He was mostly
limited to a pinch-hitting role in
which he struggled.

He spent four years with the
Twins, went back down to Triple
A, and was traded to the Los An-

geles Dodgers, where he played
for two years. In his 242 career
games in the majors, he hit just
.198 with four home runs.

After the 1975 season, the
Dodgers sold Manuel to the
Yakult Swallows of the Japanese

Central League. He found much _

more success across the Paciﬁc
Ocean, helping the Swallows
reach the championship of the
Nippon Series, the Japanese ver-
sion of the World Series.

He was later traded to the
Kinetsu Buffaloes, where he
became the ﬁrst American ever
to be named the Paciﬁc League
MVP. For his [ﬁnal season,
Manuel returned to Yakult, but a
two-inch bone spur that had gone
undiagnosed for years caused
him to retire after six seasons in
Japan. He hit a career .306 with
189 homers.

In Japan, Manuel achieved
great success in baseball, but the
culture also had an inﬂuence on
him. Manuel admits to having a
temper when he was young, but
Yakult manager Tatsuro Hirooka
calmed him down. The Japanese
emphasize practice, respect and

communication, which showed
Manuel a different approach to
the game and to life.

Kurtz described Manuel’s
experience in Japan. “‘I think
he matured when he went to Ja-
pan and played, and I think he
reached a point in his life that he
realized that he belonged in that
atmosphere.”

In the United States, he had
never made more than $21,000
playing baseball, but he received
a six-ﬁgure salary in Japan.

After his playing days were
over, Manuel did not want to
leave baseball, so he became
a minor league manager in the
Minnesota Twins’ farm system.
After ﬁve seasons, he became the
Cleveland Indians hitting coach
and was promoted to manager in
2000. '

After managing the Indians
for two-and-a-half seasons with
a 220-411 record, Manuel was
fired in July 2002 over contract
disputes with management. The
Phillies hired him as their man-
ager in 2005.

Volleyball earns ODAC crown

Generals earn eighth straight conference championship

By Stephanie Hardlman
STAFF WRITER

ROANOKE -- The Washing-

ton and Lee University volleyball

team added more hardware to its
collection this weekend after a
much-anticipated ﬁrst-place win
at the ODAC Championship.

The win marks the eighth time
the Generals clinched the confer-
ence in the past eight years. The
team headed to Hollins Univer-
sity as the number one seed in the
tournament.

On Friday the Generals played
Guilford College, the number eight
seed with a 7-22 record and 2-8 in
the ODAC. In regular season play
in October, the Generals swept the
Quakers in three straight games at
Guilford. They managed to do the
same in the tournament.

W&L ran a 25-15, 25-15, 25-
19 victory in a quick match that
only lasted about an hour. Junior
outside hitter Rachel Phillips led
the Generals with 14 kills while
junior setter Megan Steinhardt
completed 32 assists.

In semiﬁnal play, the team
faced number ﬁve-seeded Bridge-
water College. The Eagles fought
hard, but the Generals proved to
be too much in another straight-
game victory.

Bridgewater gave W&L some
trouble earlier in the season, tak-
ing them to ﬁve sets in the match-
up on Sept. 27. The story was
different this time, as the Generals
steam-rolled over the Eagles 25-
15, 26-24 and 25-15.

In the championship match,
the Generals came up against
seven-seeded “Cinderella” team
Lynchburg College. The Hornets
played in two upset matches earli-
er in the tournament, beating both

lead. Lynchburg tried to claw its
way back, but the Hornets defense
could not handle senior right-side
hitter Jessica Ulrich who added 10
kills and seven digs for W&L.

The Generals sent the Hornets
home empty-handed after a 25-19,
25-18, 25-23 match that won them
the championship.

In a pre-season poll, the
ODAC coaches voted W&L the
overwhelming favorite to win the
conference. After playing with a

two-seeded Randolph-Macon and
three-seed Virginia Wesleyan in
four and ﬁve sets respectively.
Lynchburg has never’ won an
ODAC volleyball championship.

The Hornets brought a swarm
of parents and supporters wield-
ing signs and cheers. The rowdy
crowd factored in as a “seventh
man” for Lynchburg throughout
the tournament.

Moments after the Generals
took the ﬂoor, the crowd was si-
lenced as W&L quickly took the

target on their backs all season,
the Generals clinched the win and
headed back to Lexington victori-
ous.

Unlike other teams in the
ODAC, W&L plays a very dif-
ﬁcult non-conference schedule,
including trips to play Juniata,
Christopher Newport, and Emory,
all nationally-ranked teams. This
allows the Generals to improve to
the national level and translates to
an easy win at ODACs.

Ulrich was named the tourna-

ment Most Valuable Player. She
and Phillips were nominated to
the All-Toumament Team. Phil-
lips had 11 kills and 11 digs in the
ﬁnal match.

Ulrich said that coming into the
tournament the team’s conﬁdence
was high. “There was no doubt in
my mind that we’d win the cham-
pionship again,” she said.

Now with a 31-6 record, the
Generals will extend their season
into the Division III NCAA re-
gional tournament later this week.

Head Coach Bryan Synder,
now in his ninth season with the
Generals, said that until then it is
important for his team to continue
business as usual. “We’re treating
[the championship] like any other
weekend,” he said.

Looking forward, he said the
key to victory in the post-season
will be consistency. “Go out and
play the way we’ve played the last
three weekends” and “Bring our
‘A’ game in the NCAAS,” were on
his list of to-dos.

For Ulrich, the same attitude
from this weekend will need to
translate into play later this week.
“We have a lot more volleyball to
play . . . the most important thing
will be for us to go out and play
with conﬁdence.”

Field hockey falls in semis

Generals ousted from ODAC tournament in a 6-0 loss to EMU

By Llzz Dye
surr wrmsn

After a blowout victory over
Virginia Wesleyan last Saturday in
the ﬁrst round of the playoffs, the
Washington and Lee University
ﬁeld hockey team headed to East-
ern Mennonite University (EMU)
Wednesday. The Generals faced
EMU in regular-season play on
Oct. 3 and won 3-2 in overtime.

Unfortunately, the Generals
were the victims of a blowout
game this time around. ‘Their sea-
son came to an end with a 6-0 loss
on Wednesday night to the EMU
Royals.

EMU junior forward Alyssa
Derstine opened up the scoring
with an unassisted goal just 3:22
into the first half. After the early
goal, the Generals picked up the
intensity and and began to pres-
sure the Royals’ defense, but EMU
took a 2-0 lead when junior mid-
ﬁelder Julie Denlinger scored off
of a pass from sophomore forward

Kate Cimini right before halftime.

The Generals led in both shots
and penalty comers at halftime but
were not able to convert any of
their scoring opportunities.

the ﬁeld hockey season came to a
close sooner than wanted or ex-
pected, I have no regrets about
the season. It has been a wonder-
ful group of women to work with.

“Even though it wasn ’t the best way to end

our season, this was deﬁnitely one of our best

seasons. I fully expect an even better showing

next year and really think our team has a lot of

promise. ’

Sallle Armstrong, junior forward
 

EMU scored 4 more goals in
the second half. Cimini scored a
hat trick while-ﬁrst-year Valerie
Landis tallied one more. The ﬁnal
score was 0-6.

Despite the loss, W&L Head
Coach Wendy Orrison praised her
players, especially her senior lead-
ers for a great season. “Although

I’m proud to have been able to
lead them and I will miss my ﬁne
senior group: Louise Bance, Me-
lissa Dolan, Liz Garson, Lizzie
Gotimer, Christina Merchant, and
Guada Suarez. Louise Bance and
Jennie Norcini both earned All-
toumament team honors for their
great play.”

Junior goalkeeper Caroline Ha-
bliston played the entire game and
tallied eight saves. Junior Grace
McGee notched two defensive
saves while sophomore Jennie
Norcini had one. ’

Although disappointed with the
loss, junior forward Sallie Ann-
strong, who led the team in scor-
ing, was happy with the season.
“Even though it wasn’t the best
way to end our season, this was
deﬁnitely one of our best seasons.
I fully expect an even better show-
ing next year and really think our
team has a lot of promise.”

Also looking forward to the
2009 season, McGee echoed Arm-
strong’s comments. “It was cer-
tainly disappointing for-the season
to end, but the young talent on the
team is promising for next year.”

EMU faced Lynchburg Col-
lege on Nov. 8 in the ﬁnals of the
ODAC tournament. Lynchburg
came out on top by a 4-2 score and
will receive an automatic bid to
the NCAA tournament.

Women’s soccer ends season

Team loses I-0 to_Lynchburg on controversial call by the referees in ODAC semis

By Adam Cancryn
snxrr wnm-zn

A controversial play put an end
to the Generals’ championship
hopes on Wednesday, as they fell
to rival Lynchburg College in the
ODAC semiﬁnals.

Just minutes into the game,
a collision 15 yards from the net
allowed Hornets’ sophomore
forward Betsy Kwiatkowski to
notch the game’s lone goal. The
referees made no call, but W&L
players thought Kwiatkowski had
clearly fouled defender Marisa
Van Brunt.

“Looking at the tape of the
game, the Lynchburg player bla-
tantly pushed Marisa in the back,
which was ultimately the reason
they got the goal,” said senior for-
ward Anne Van Devender.

Though the Generals came out
attacking during a strong second
half, they could not erase the deﬁ-

cit. The Lynchburg defense turned
away every scoring chance, seal-
ing their victory with a save by
goalie Jackie Bader in the closing

seniors Van Devender, Van Brunt
and goalkeeper Kiki Moreo, W&L
scored 86 total goals while allow-
ing just 16.

“We had a pretty successful season. I think it

was a season of ‘almost. ’ We almost won every

game, just like we almost made it to the ODAC

ﬁnal. ”

Anne Van Devender, senlor forward

seconds. V

The defeat marks the ﬁfth con-
secutive time W&L has fallen in
the tournament semiﬁnals.

Nevertheless, the season was
deemed a success. The Generals
ﬁnished 9-2 in conference play,
with all of the victories coming
by three goals or more. Led by

The Women’s soccer team also
proved it could compete with the
best teams in the country. Four
of W&L’s ﬁve losses were by one
goal, including a 4-3 overtime
thriller versus national number
one Messiah College. The Gen-
erals used their superior speed to
take the lead three separate times

against Messiah, who barely es-
caped Watt Field with their perfect
record intact.

“I think we had a pretty suc-
cessful season,” said Van Dev-
ender. “I think it was a season of
‘almost.’ We almost won every
game, just like we almost made it
to the ODAC ﬁnal.”

Looking ahead, the Generals
seem primed to erase “almost”
from the equation in 2009. The
team boasts a wealth of young tal-
ent, many of whom have already
made an impact. First-year for-
wards Kat Barnes, Allie Espina
and Anne Masich combined to
tally 33 goals this season while
keeper Emily Leary started nine
games in net for the Generals.

With the exception of the ﬁve
seniors, the rest of the 28-player
roster is expected to return next
year.

Charlie Manuel

continued from page 8

Under Manuel’s leadership, the Phillies ﬁnished ﬁrst
in the National League East in both 2007 and 2008.
In the 2008 division series, Philadelphia beat the Mil-
waukee Brewers in four games and went on to beat the
Dodgers, Manuel’s former club, in ﬁve games.

On Oct. 10, though, just hours before the start of
Game 2 of the National League_Championship Series,
Charlie’s mother passed away at 87. She had suffered a
heart attack a week earlier.

The day before June Manuel died, Charlie called her
at the Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital to ask if he
should come home. As Charlie’s sister Brenda Clark
told the Roanoke Times, “She said, ‘No, you do what
you do best. I want you to win ballgames.”’

“She told him she was very sick and please pray
for her, and he told her that he would and asked her to
pray for him and the team. She told him that she had
been and for him not to worry. He was going to win the
World Series. He would get the pennant, and he would
win,” recalled Mills.

June Manuel’s funeral was held the morning of Oct.
17 at the Pentecostal Holiness Church, where Charles
Sr. was pastor almost 50 years ago. The service, which
was closed to the media, was scheduled around the Phil-
lies’ playoff games so that Charlie could attend.

Mills, who ofﬁciated the service, stated, “When
[Charlie] came in for the funeral, I think he did lay aside
[baseball] during that time. He laid aside the game that
was awaiting him, and he focused on that opportunity
for closure with his mother’s parting.”

Up until her death, June was a very devoted fan of
the Phillies and Charles Jr.,  she called him. “The
day before she died. she clutched. . .the Roanoke Times
sports section to her chest as she laid in the hospital bed.
When the doctors and nurses would come in, she would
show them the paper and say. ‘That’s my son.’ She was
very proud of him,” shared Mills. 1

In the World Series, June Manuel’s prediction came
true: Charlie and the Phillies beat the Tampa Bay Rays
in ﬁve games.

Kurtz, who has remained close with Manuel, said,
“I called him the day after the championship, and we
talked with him and he was a happy young man — old
man, not a young man,” as he chuckled.

Buena Vista has been celebrating “Fook’s” world
championship ever since. Mayor Mike Clements de-
scribed the World Series as “a dream come true” for
the city.

On the comer of Magnolia Ave. and 21st St. at the
center of Buena Vista stands a marquee congratulating
Manuel: “Good Job Charlie, 2008 World Series.”

Ronnie Coffey, a local photographer and Buena Vis-
ta’s director of parks & recreation, grew up with Manuel
who was a couple years older. In fact, Manuel was his
little league coach. Coffey thinks that Manuel’s success
will provide inspiration to the children of Buena Vista.
“If you try hard enough, work hard enough, are good
enough, and you get a little bit of luck, you always got
a chance to be a Charlie Manuel and play in the major
leagues.” -

Noting Buena Vista’s close-knit, small community,
Rebecca Gates, superintendent of the Buena Vista City
Public Schools, said, “The beauty of this town is that
everybody knows everybody, and we’re very excited to
have this kind of person coming from Buena Vista. 
It’s huge for the community.”

In early December, Manuel is expected to return
to Buena Vista to celebrate with his fornrer town. At
Clements’ suggestion, the city council voted to declare
Dec. 6 “Charlie Manuel Day” in Buena Vista. I

The Blues Education Foundation of the Buena Vista
Public Schools Division is holding a charity event on
Dec. 6 at 5:00 p.m. in the Parry McCluer High School
gyrrmasium to recognize Manuel’s accomplishments.
The night will begin with a silent auction of Phillies
memorabilia and community donations, which will be
followed by a dinner. Superintendent Gates noted that
there will also be time for Manuel to sign autographs.
The Phillies manager will conclude the event with a
keynote address.

Tickets are $25 per person and can be purchased
at the school board ofﬁce, Carpet Outlet or the BB&T
bank in Buena Vista. All proceeds will beneﬁt the
Blues Education Foundation, whose purpose, as Gates
said, “is to raise money that will go to the classroom for
instruction.”

“We had this set up a few months ago with Charles
Manuel before he won the World Series, so obviously,
we’re thrilled that events have turned out the way that
they have,” stated Gates.

According to Clements, the city is also exploring
the possibility of including Manuel in the Christmas
parade scheduled for Dec. 4. “We’re trying to ﬁgure
out whether he’s going to be here that early or not,” he
said.

Joe Lyles, who has coached and taught Physical Ed-
ucation at W&L for 50 years, refereed Manuel in high
school basketball games. Having played professional
baseball himself, Lyles said, “I wanted to meet him
many times, didn’t have a chance, but heard when he
comes back [in early December], I will be introduced to
him. I respect him an awful lot. He came up the hard
way.”

Coming from a humble background, Manuel contin-
ued to pursue his dream of winning a world champi-
onship. As his sister Brenda Clark told the Roanoke
Times, “Charlie worked very hard to get where he is
today. Sometimes dreams and miracles ‘do happen.”

Generals end season with 14-1 7 loss to Emory & Henry

By Brian Devlne
STAFF WRITER

On a cold, windy Saturday
at Wilson Field the Washington
and Lee football season came
to an end in agonizing fashion
as the Generals lost to Emory
& Henry 17-14 in overtime. It
was a painful end to a rather
painful season.

At the start of the year,
the Generals’ fortunes looked
bright. Picked third in the
preseason conference coaches‘
poll, W&L was poised on the
brink of its sixth consecutive
winning season. Perhaps that
place in the rankings was
overstated; a signiﬁcant portion
of the team’s stars graduated
after the 2007 season, especially
on the defensive side of the
ball. But with the return of
quarterback RJ. Varner and
do-everything running back
Stuart Sitterson, W&L fans had
reason to be optimistic.

The problems started
immediately: W&L was shut
out in its first game, 24-0, at
Franklin & Marshall. After that

disastrous start, coach Frank
Miriello made the controversial
decision to replace Varner
with ﬁrst-year Charlie Westfal.
Westfal led his team to four
straight victories, including
the school’s ﬁrst-ever win over
neighboring Southern Virginia
and over 2007 ODAC runner-
up Randolph-Macon. At 4-1 the
squad had a legitimate chance
to challenge for the conference
title, but from there the wheels
came off. W&L failed to win
another game, dropping five
straight conference match-ups,
including three at home, and
ﬁnished 4-6, below .500 for the
first time in six years

Against Emory & Henry, a
team that the Generals should
have beaten, the culprits were
the same they have been during
this ﬁve-game skid: turnovers,
lack of discipline and lack of
speed on the defensive side
of the ball. Westfal has shown
promise this season, but he
must cut down on his mistakes
(three fumbles lost and an
interception in the end zone in
overtime on Saturday) if he is

to become the Generals’ signal-
caller for the next three years.

The hosts were also called
for 63-yards worth of penalties,
and it was a silly late hit call
on senior safety Chris Prugar
that gave the Wasps the ﬁeld
position to tie the game late in
the fourth quarter. The Blue-
and-White cannot hope to
be one of the elite teams in a
rapidly improving conference
if they make mental errors in
key situations.

But ultimately W&L lost
too much defensive talent
to graduation. While Matt
Cassilly, Tommy Matteo and
Scott Russell had particularly
good seasons, the defense
proved unable to replace Kyle
Luby, Bryant Fiilk, Jimmy Gift
and Mark Snoddy, perhaps four
of the best defensive players in
W&L history. The patchwork
defense allowed 209 rushing
yards on Saturday to Caleb
Jennings.

There was one bright spot
on Saturday, though, and
once again it came from the
unquestioned 2008 Generals

MVP, Stuart Sitterson. Sitterson
had his usual solid game A 181
total yards and 2 touchdowns
— and thanks to his efforts
Saturday he will graduate from
W&L as the all-time leader in
both season (2,096) and career
(5,981) all-purpose yards.
Sittersoii was also awarded,
rightfully so, the 2008 Falcon
Award, given to one senior
football player each year.

What’s next for the
Generals? A 2009 season ﬁlled
with uncertainty. There is still
a lot of talent on this W&L
team. lf Westfal and fellow
first-year Cody Smith and
Jonathan Clemo continue to
develop, they will go far next
year. Juniors Matt Cassilly
and Donavon Sawyer will
lead the defense in 2009, and it
seems W&L has ﬁnally found
a reliable field goal kicker
in Martin Prichard. But the
2009 Generals must show
marked improvement in key
areas — focus, discipline and
limiting turnovers and penalties
~— if they want to challenge for
a conference title.
