Presidential
Inauguration

% " 70 W&L students and staﬂ
will travel to D. C. to attend

the 64th inauguration

By Anne Vesoulis
STAFF WRITER

While the nation watches the 64th Presidential
Inauguration on network television this Tuesday,
70 Washington and Lee students, facultyvand staff
will join a crowd of millions in Washington D.C.
to see Barack Obama become the 44th President of

the United States.

Due to Obama’s popularity as a transition pres-
ident in uncertain times and his distinction as the
ﬁrst African-American in that office, crowds are
expected to be the biggest in history- between 1.5

and 4 million.

, Dean of Students Dawn Watkins, who will
attend the inauguration, said it is the ﬁrst time a
group of W&L students has expressed interest in
going to the presidential inauguration en masse.

Since Obama was elected president last No-
vember. Junior Chris Rucker has been working
closely with Associate Dean of Students Tamara

“I want to get as close to the ac-
tion as possible. I know the city
fairly well, so I ’m pretty conﬁdent

I ’ll be able to maneuver my way

at least to the mall. ”

Prof. Toni Locy, Journalism Department

Futrell to coordinate a trip to the inauguration.
“I am so excited to be travelling with the Wash-
ington and Lee community to witness this historic

_ event,” Rucker said.

With 240,000 ticket-holders and at least 1 mil-
lion people without tickets watching from the Na-
tional Mall, getting to the 64th Inauguration will

not be easy.

The two charter busses will leave campus at
midnight on Tuesday. While the trip to Washing-
ton, D.C. normally takes three and half hours,
organizers expect the group to arrive around 7:00

a.m due to the high volume of traffic.

All of the bridges to the Capitol from Virginia
will be closed to all through-trafﬁc except charter
busses. They will travel to the greater Washington
D.C. area and the group will take the metro to the
National Mall to witness the swearing-in ceremo-

. ny at approximately 11:30 a.m.

At a time when good value is
worth more than a brand name, ﬁ-
SmartMoney
and Kiplinger have come out with
college rankings that show parents

In» the Dec. 16 issue of Smart-
Money magazine, Washington &
Lee ranked as the best _value among
all private liberal arts universities.

In Kiplinger’s rankings of liberal
arts schools, W&L came in ﬁfth.
rankings were
derived from the median yearly
income after three and 15 years di-
vided by the out-of-state degree cost,
resulting in a “return on tuition in-
vestment.” W&L was found to have
a 145 percent payback—~the runners
up were the University of Richmond,
Lafeyette College and College of the

But both SmartMoney and Kip-

linger’s rankings favored public
universities over private ones, due
to the typically lower cost of at-
tending a public university. In their
overall ranking of public and private
schools, SmartMoney placed Texas
A&M at number one, University of

Payscalecom, which recently pub-
lished a survey on alumni salaries.
The accompanying article by Neil
Parmar claims Texas A&M on aver-
age delivers two and a half times the
payback of Harvard.

Texas at number two and Georgia
Tech at number three, with paybacks

Kiplinger
placed the University of North Caro-

SmartMoney’s data came from

drawn criticism for overlooking
‘ graduate degrees as a source of in-
come, not accounting for grants and
scholarships, and not including the
quality of an education and the re-
sulting effect on society. Parmar
retorts, “Show me the money.”

New rankings name W&L a good value

His point being, with a weakened
economy many parents will be look-
ing for the best deal for their son or
daughter’s education. Regardless
of a university’s prestige, alumni
network or teacher-to-student ratio,
does it deliver a high payback?

Economics Prof. Art Goldsmith
disagrees with the money-first men-
tality: “We’re not interested in strict-
ly dollar returns  If we were guid-
ed by something like that, we might
not have a classics department or we
might not have a theater department,
and that would mean we aren’t giv-
ing our students a very good educa-
tion.”

“I think that’s a particularly poor
measure of what a university imparts
on its students,” he said.

  W&L gets revised curriculum .

Curriculum changes mean fewer overall credits and only one Spring Term course

By Allison Chopin
MANAGING EDITOR

New curricular changes to take effect
in the fall may require students to give

more thought to their academic plan-‘

ning.

After this year, 113 credits will be re-
quired for graduation, while those grad-
uating this year need 115.

A limit will be placed on the number
of credits that can be earned from other
institutions. Of the 113 required credits,
no more than 56 can be earned in a way
other than courses offered by Washing-
ton and Lee University or through for-
mal exchanges such as those that occur
with Mary Baldwin, Virginia Military
Institute and others. This means that stu-
dents must take 57 credits at W&L. Any
transfer credits, courses done abroad or
credits earned before the ﬁrst year at

W&L will not count in these 57 credits.
Of course, students are welcome to

earn credits abroad or from other institu-

tions in excess of 56 credits and there-

“There are some con-
cerns, but everyone is
adopting it pretty enthusi-
astically. ”

Scott Dittman, University Registrar

fore go beyond 113 credits by gradua-
tion. But they must remember that they
will still have to achieve 57 credits from
W&L courses.

According to Scott Dittman, Univer-

sity Registrar, the number of credits that
could be brought in from elsewhere in
the past was 87.

Beginning with the ﬁrst-year class of
2013, entering students may receive no
more than_28 credits for work done prior

. to W&L. This includes AP and IB credit

and college courses taken before enter-
ing W&L.

The reason for these and other chang-
es is part of what Dittman called “aca-
demic life renewal.” He and the faculty
believe that students should be encour-
aged to take full advantage of the aca-
demic opportunities at W&L.

The Spring Term course load has also
been revised. Beginning with the Spring
of 2010, all courses in the term will be
four credits. Students will only take one
course. Only one additional credit will
be allowed, or one non-credit class such

as a P.E. skills course, as long as these do
not interfere with the four-credit class.

' No overloads beyond the ﬁve-credit lim-

it will be allowed.

The obligations of each four-credit
course will be demanding. According
to Dittman, these courses will involve
about nine hours in class each week
and several hours of work outside of the
classroom.

Exceptions will only be made for the
six-credit off-campus courses that al-
ready exist, such as the Washington and
New York Terms and programs abroad.
These programs will be allowed to con-
tinue for six weeks, and participants will
receive six credits. Seniors who plan to
graduate in May will not be able to take
these courses.

Outages blacken W&L

A faulty fuse caused temporary outages in many buildings

Bylamie Kim
smrr wmmz

Unexpected power outages last
Monday kept academic buildings
dark and cold while facilities made
repairs to a transformer.

“It was an unplanned outage,”-
said Mike Carmagnola, the execu-
tive director of facilities and capital
planning. Receiving several reports
on Monday afternoon that the power
went out, the Facilities Management
began to look where the problem had
started.

“We found out that the transform-
er that sits behind the Development
Building shut down,” said Carrnag-
nola. They soon discovered a burnt
fuse in the transformer. The fuse
turned out to be worn out and short,
burning the transformer instead of
doing its job of protecting it.

Facilities Management had to
shut down the entire North Zone to
make repairs, including the Admis-
sions Ofﬁce, Colonnade, duPont
Hall, Hotchkiss House, Lee Chapel,
Leyburn Library, Reeves Center, Sci-

ence Center, and Watson Pavilion.
With a high voltage line circulat-
ing the North Zone, one small glitch
can affect the entire area. '
“The light was ﬂickering on and
off while I was working on Mon-
day,” said sophomore Van Nguyen,

except in the Development Build-
ing.

“Luckily, that was the Develop-
ment Building, so classes in other
buildings were not affected,” Car-
magnola said.

“The transformer supplies our

a work-study student at the Reeves
Center. Because the North Zone was
shut down at midnight, she could not
enter the library to get her textbooks.
“I couldn’t study for my classes the
next day,” she said.

The Facilities Management
worked through the night to get the
power back on by 4 a.m. on Tuesday,

building, so we had no power and
no heat,” said Tres Mullis, Director
of Development Building. “Our ad-
ministrative support staff works on
desktop computers, and the software
for our databasetis only on those
computers.”

Having no electricity to run the
computers, the administrative sup-

port staff had an unexpected two-day
break from their work, while the pro-
fessional staff worked either at home
or on campus during the power out-
age.

“There really was nothing they
could do,” said Mullis. “”We tried to
be as productive as we could. We had
to ﬁnd various places on campus.”

It was a disappointment for some
students, however.

‘‘I was hoping that classes would
get cancelled on Tuesday,” said
sophomore Kyle Parsons.

“Power outages, both planned
and unplanned, are not regular
events,” said Cannagnola. “When
we have a planned power outage, it
usually relates to some upgrade of
the facilities that we’re working on.
The unplanned outages are treated as
an emergency, and receive priority
treatment, just like the recent event
for the north zone electric.”

Emeritus Prof. Odell McGuire dies at 81

Odell McGuire, a former pro-
fessor of geology at Washington
and Lee, died at age 81 on Decem-

Rehab Center.

McGuire, a native of Knoxville,
Tenn., came to W&L in 1962 after
serving in the Navy during World
War II and as an infantry ofﬁcer in
the Korean War where he earned a
Purple Heart.

Over the next 32 years as a
W&L professor he developed a
reputation as a man of many inter-
ests and talents. According to Ed
Spencer, a fellow geology profes-

ber 8 at Heritage Hall Health and 

sor, McGuire taught himself Greek .

in order to revise translations of
early Greek writings, was envi-
ronrnentally active, and learned to
play clawhammer banjo.

A McGuire became a ﬁxture of
the local bluegrass scene and in-
spired a generation of young mu-
sicians to follow in his footsteps,
including Randall Ray, a local mu-
sician who graduated from W&L
in 1985 and went on to become a
guitar maker. ,

McGuire’s scientiﬁc interests
included paleontology, geologic
mapping, environmental impacts
and land-use planning, geology of
the Appalachians, hydrology, evo-

lutionary theory, geomorphology,
geohydrology and stratigraphy.

“Many students will remember
him as a hard taskmaster, one who
brought a rare breadth of knowl-
edge to the classroom and ‘ one
who lived life fully,” Spencer was
quoted to say in a university news
release. “It is very sad to see one
of the most distinctive characters
of this community pass from our
midst.”

McGuire and his former wife,
Mata Battye McGuire, have three
children, Melanie, Forrest and Jes-
se. Jesse McGuire is a cook at the
Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity.

A “New Birth of Freedom ”

“I want to get as close to the action as possible
ble,” Locy said. “I know the city fairly well, so
I’m pretty conﬁdent I’ll be able to maneuver my
way at least to the mall. Travelling with a group
of students will be an adventure in itself, although
I’m sure that we will be sleeping most of the way
there.” ‘

The ceremony’s theme, “A New Birth of Free-
dom,” commemorates the 200th anniversary of the
birth of Abraham Lincoln, another Illinois sena-
tor who became president. The inauguration also
falls on the day after Martin Luther King Jr. day,
the only federal holiday to recognize an African-
American.

The inauguration will include musical selec-
tions by artists including singer Aretha Franklin,
cellist Yo-Yo Ma and violinist Itzhak Perlman.
California Sen. Diane Feinstein, Dr. Rick Warren
and the Rev. Dr. Joseph E. Lowery are scheduled
to speak.

Prior to his inaugural address, President-Elect
Barack Obama will take the oath of ofﬁce using
Abraham Lincoln’s inaugural bible provided by
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.

Following the inauguration ceremony, the
group will make its way toward the White House
to witness the inaugural parade that traditionally
begins around 2:30 p.m. The parade will include
marching bands from high schools and universi-
ties across the United States. Cadets from the Vir-
ginia Military Institute will march in the parade.

Junior Morgan Harris said Obama’s inaugura-
tion is signiﬁcant because of his ability to inspire.

“Obama is truly the ﬁrst president who un-
derstands and embraces our generation,” Harris
said. “I’m not an Obama fanatic but it’s cool to see
someone who can inspire so many people.”

Those interested  attendinlgpthe inauguration
should email Christopher Rucker at Ruckerc@
wlu.edu. A $35.00 fee in the form of cash or a

check is due to Dean F utrell in order to secure a _

reservation.

students, with Davidson which
does not is like “comparing apples
and oranges,” Goldsmith said.

Financial Aid Director John De-
Courcy said the SmartMoney rank-
ings are an “oversimpliﬁcation”
of retum-on-investment question.
Some students pay a fraction of the
total tuition due to ﬁnancial aid while
others pay full price, he said.

Still, DeCourcy stands behind the
reputation of W&L as good value.
“We have traditionally been a best
buy,” he said.

According to DeCourcy, W&L
began raising tuition ten years ago

to help pay for the expansion of
certain academic programs and
projects around school, such as the
construction of Elrod Commons.
The out-of-state degree cost in 1993
was $45,350, almost half that of the
degree cost in 2005, according to
SmartMoney.

Decourcy said. “If you want to be
in the top ten, you know you’ve got
to have the programs, and you’ve got

- to have the campus, and the whole

nine yards,” DeCourcy said. “Basi-
cally we were selling a Mercedes for
a Chevy price.”

While W&L is in a higher price
range similar to the northern liberal
arts schools, W&L’s ﬁnancial aid
packages have also become more
generous and competitive, Decourcy
said. In the past ﬁve years, ﬁnancial
aid funding has increased such that a

student’s entire .need based on his or
her parents’ income is fulﬁlled with
grant money, DeCourcy said.

Financial aid is paid for by W&L’s
endowment, and despite its 15 per-
cent decline this year, DeCourcy
says ﬁnancial aid will continue to be
competitive. “We’re right there- not
a problem,” he said.

Kiplinger took a more thorough
approach, combining affordability
and academic quality with quality
accounting for two-thirds of the total.
The categories include admissions
rate, student-to-faculty ratio, gradu-
ation rate, aid from grants, non-need
based aid and average debt.

In a list of 50 liberal arts colleges,
W&L came in ﬁfth behind Panoma,
Swarthmore, Williams and David-
son. In the top 100, the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill came

in ﬁrst overall. Most of Kiplinger’s
data came from Peterson’s, a com-
pany specializing in test preparation
and college planning.

Senior Associate Editor Jane
Clark writes, “As our rankings dem-
onstrate, higher prices overall don’t
necessarily mean you’ll pay more for
your student’s education. Financial-
aid awards can knock thousands of
dollars off the price tag, especially if
your family qualiﬁes for need-based
aid.”

This year, W&L is absent from
Princeton Review’s best value
rankings, according the W&L blog
“What’s News.” The blog states
W&L declined to participate in
Princeton Review’s data collection
due to concerns over their method-

ology.

But Dittman anticipates that some of the Spring
Term programs abroad will be reduced to four
weeks and four credits. Students wishing to study
abroad for a longer period should be encouraged
to take a full semester, year or summer abroad.

Faculty will only teach one class during Spring
Term. Spring Term courses may not be taken as
Pass/Fail.

The Spring Term course load may make it dif-
ﬁcult for some students to complete their majors
or required classes on time. Students who will be
juniors and seniors next year should start planning
now so they will be able to ﬁt in their courses.

“Advising will be important,” Dittman said.
“Rising seniors need to be a little more intention-
al.”

He explained that advisers, faculty and depart-
ments will have to make sure that students can ful-

ﬁll requirements in the fall and winter semesters

rather than putting them off for the Spring Term.
“Most of the classes that are required [for ma-
jors and Foundation and Distribution Require-
ments] will be moved to other terms,” he said.
A lot of departments are also revising the num-

More than money

Rankings are great but don ’t tell
the whole story of W&L is value

Cheers to Washington and Lee for topping SmartMoney’s list of
the best value for private liberal arts universities. According to the
magazine, the average “payback” for W&L students is 145 percent
when mean salaries are compared to tuition paid.

But perhaps the university deserves even more praise than these
ﬁnancial magazines claim. '

First, the rankings do not consider the abundance of scholarships
and ﬁnancial aid. With the new Johnson Scholarship program and
the previous George Washington Honor Scholarships, up to 10 per-
cent of each incoming class can attend W&L on a full ride.

Financial aidnumbers tell a similar story, especially with the em-
phasis on funds from grants rather than loans.

We don’t have calculations that show the actual “payback,” but it
seems that if aid is factored in, salaries are even higher when com-
pared to the money actually spent to attend W&L.

Moreover, to put it simply, money isn’t everything. Do most stu-

Money isn ’t everything. Do most students re-
ally only consider their future salaries when

considering the “value” of an education?
 

dents really only consider their future salaries when considering the
“value” of an education at W&L? How can such a ranking even
begin to show what makes a school worth our time and money?

If that’s what the university believed in, we probably wouldn’t be
a liberal arts institution. We cherish the classes that we take outside
of our majors and endless chances to study abroad and do research,
for example. And we can’t forget Spring Term—~a rarity and some-
thing that is continually being improved upon.

We also love the small class sizes and the relationships we form
with our professors—things you might not ﬁnd at Texas A&M and
Georgia Tech, which were at the top of the list that covered all col-
leges.

And then there’s the even less tangible: the honor system and the
endless traditions at our institution, among many otherswe could
name. '

We may not be able to quantify these distinct attributes in terms of
a dollar amount, like we can do with tuitions and salaries, but these
are what prospective students consider when choosing W&L and
what current students and graduates likely reﬂect back upon. These
are the reasons we choose to pay thousands of dollars to attend W&L
or why we worked extra hard to earn a scholarship or seek ﬁnancial
aid. These are the things that make W&L a “best value.”

Airing dirty laundry

Grace has problems with our poor laundry etiquette

By Grace Andrews
C0 LU M NIST

Today’s topic is one of my fa-
vorites: laundry room etiquette.

I must place a DISCLAIMER
here. What I am about to say may
apply to you, but that is not to of-
fend anyone, solely to enlighten.

I am now a senior, and live in
the International House, but I’ve
overheard friends who live in
the dorms as well as fellow RAs
complain about a few instances
of sketchy laundering.

Around two years ago, I was

’in the laundry room located in

Gilliam when I was not only a
victim, but also a witness to bad
laundry room etiquette.

To begin, my roommate at the
time and I had loaded our laun-
dry in an almost vacant laundry
room. There were a handful of
open washing machines and
since it was almost 11 pm, we
weren’t too worried about hav-
ing any laundering problems.

Boy, were we wrong! Af-
ter getting too involved in an
episode of “Veronica Mars,”
my roomie and I returned to the
laundry room about twenty min-
utes after our clothes had ﬁnished
washing.

When we entered the laun-
dry room, we were shocked (by
shocked, I mean a little upset in
our spirits) to ﬁnd that our clothes
were located outside of the safety
and warmth of a Washington and
Lee washing machine.

My clothes had somehow
mysteriously grown legs and
found their way to the counter-
top located across from the ma-
chines. My roommate’s clothes
were on top of the machine I had
used and the one next to it. Not
only were the clothes located on
top of the machine, but the ma-
chine was being used by some-
one else.

I couldn’t help BUT laugh
during that moment. I could not
believe it. There, on top of the
counter were my brightly polka-
dotted undergarments for ALL
THE WORLD to see.

To make matters worse, there
were two young men in there who
had the pleasure of watching me
try to conceal my intimates.

To make the situation even
more unbearable, the young man
who had hijacked our washers
suddenly walked into the laun-
dry room. I could not believe
my eyes. The washer-watcher

walked in whistling and shuf-
ﬂing his little machine-stealing
feet while I gave him my ﬁre-
starting glare (which he did not
notice).

The thought of this total
stranger taking my unmention-
ables out of the washer made me
a little uncomfortable. What he
did next truly disturbed me.

The dryer door-opener pro-
ceeded to open dryers that were
currently in use, for reasons that
I’m not sure of, and closed the
doors without restarting them.
Then, he removed clothes from a
recently ﬁnished-dryer to use it
himself.

When I say recently ﬁnished,
I mean that he waited next to the

dryer until it beeped, despite the ,

laundry room informing students
that detergent theft is an honor
code violation too.

It is one that I was a victim
of so many times while living on
campus, so much so that I went
through a bottle of detergent and
Shout per month, even though I
only did about 5 loads a month.

The irony of the situation was
that on my way home, I acciden-
tally took an unnamed bottle of
Shout that I thought was mine.
However, when I realized it
wasn’t mine, I screamed loudly
(I thought I had committed an

to return it.

As much as I wanted to judge

fact that there were two empty
ones. This young man then went
around to boxes of Snuggle and
other various dryer sheet brands
sniﬂing and “borrowing” sheets.
When I say snifﬁng, I mean sniff-
ing. This bounce-sniffer smelled
the sheets so hard I thought they
might lose their freshness.

Now, I’m not sure if this laun-
dry room renegade ever returned
any of these sheets or not, but I
thought it was a bit hold to be so
picky.

I think the saying goes, “beg-
gars can’t be choosers.”

After undetectably observing
this clear and disturbing viola-
tion of laundry room etiquette, I
quickly set my cell phone alarm
for approximately an hour. I was
stricken with a fear of coming in
and ﬁnding my clothes placed
upon some unclean surface.

As I walked home, I won-
dered if ‘ole Sir Sniffs-a-lot had
“borrowed” some detergent too,
and how picky he had been.

You see, common sense would
tell you that if you do decide to
“borrow” detergent from some-
one, you should ﬁnd a really full
bottle to use. However it seems
to me that people don’t think this
thoroughly. That’s probably why
there is now a sign in Gilliam’s

sniffer, I realized that I was just
as guilty as him of violating good
laundry room etiquette.

My ﬁrst year, my roommate
and I “accidentally” took so many
socks that we could have socked
a barefoot Centipede. It’s not that
we did it on purpose; it’s just that
when you take your items out of
the washer or dryer, you never
notice what could have been left
there by someone else.

I remember one time our ﬁrst-
year when I asked my roommate
to get my things out of the dryer
for me. She returned with about
three new t-shirts and some more
socks (surprise, surprise).

The problem in that situation
was that I didn’t fold my clothes
for several days and it was right
before a break. Thus, when I no-
ticed strange un-Grace like items
in my basket, it was already
too late. Even though I took the
stuff back, folded and clean, and
placed them on a clean surface,
no one ever retrieved the items
and they became property of the
laundry room.

I think that is why there are
so many clothing items on the
ﬂoor — people don’t know what’s
theirs and what’s not. Out of fear
of committing an honor code vi-
olation, they just leave the stuff

on the ground or counter and
walk away.

Honestly though, who ’s going
to pick up theirrunderpants off of
a linty ground after several days?
That’s right, not me. Short of the
mortifying idea of having to do
that in front of people I don’t
know, I bet the clothes aren’t as
clean anymore.

I’m not saying that people
shouldn’t take a washer or dryer
that they need or “borrow” deter-
gent and dryer sheets when they
are running low, but there should
be some sort of discretion that is
applied. For instance, I myself
have never removed someone
else’s clothes from either the
dryer or the washer. I always sit
and wait, or wash my clothes at
another time.

In my public laundering opin-
ion, 1 think that you should give
everyone thirty-minutes to come
and get their stuff. You never
know if the owner of the items
you want to remove is doing
something important, such as a
take-home test or watching “Ve-
ronica Mars.”

Although, I must say that I
hate when people just leave their
clothes in washers or dryers for
hours and never pick them up.

I know that I have friends who
have put their stuff in the dryer
at some god-forsaken hour (dur-
ing the night that is) and return
the next day to pick them up. I
don’t advise doing that, as you
may have some strange bacterial
creature growing on your favor-
ite t-shirt and trying to befriend
the lint on your towel.

However, if you are in a hurry
and cannot wait, please be kind
enough to place the clothes on
a clean surface and conceal any
items that may be deemed em-
barrassing for others to see.

Also, don’t go around taking
only the rain-shower fresh dryer
sheets and leaving the tropical-
mist ones in the discarded scents
pile. The tropical-mist sheets
have feelings too.

As the season of pledgeship
begins, I would like the pledges
to take heed to this article. Main-
tain good laundry behavior as
you do enough of your frats laun-
dry to be a dry cleaner. Please
remember to “borrow” responsi-
bly and “replace” when you can;
most importantly, remember that
friends don’t let friends become
washer-watchers, dryer door-
openers, and bounce-sniffers.

MLK’s dream is not here quite yet

Applauding Obama because he is black forgets that King valued character

By Abel Delgado
COLU M NIST

The signiﬁcance is impos-
sible to ignore. Eighty years after
the birth of Martin Luther King
Jr., the nation Dr. King lived and
died to create will inaugurate

Barack Obama as its president._

We are a different America than
we were back when Dr. King was
born, and that is reason enough
to celebrate.

When I visited the D.C. area a
few weeks ago, it looked like the
Obama celebration had already
started.

I couldn’t even buy a metro
ticket without seeing the Presi-
dent-elect’s picture on it. As a
Republican, this should have
bothered me. It should have been
a reminder of a failed election ef-
fort, but I was surprisingly not all
that bothered.

Seeing Obama’s face every
where is the clearest reminder
that he’s not like the 43 men
who preceded him. Seeing white
Americans buy t-shirts with a
photo of the future ﬁrst family,

the ﬁrst black family to be the
ﬁrst family, was an excellent ex-
ample of America’s ‘evolving at-
titudes on race.

I wondered if the street-ven-
dors that sold the t-shirts, many
of them speaking with foreign
accents, were thinking that one
day their children could grow up
to be on those t-shirts.

A t-shirt with the faces of Dr.
King and President-Elect Obama
even stated that “The dream
came true.” It sure looked that
way, but has it really?

For minority Republicans like
me, the pride is bitter-sweet at
best. My guy lost. My ideas lost.
Why should I be proud?

Well, the fact that a “non-An-
glo,” “multi-cultural” “minor-
ity,” or whatever you want to call
it, was elected to lead a diverse
country with so little history of
diversity in the ruling the class is

~ signiﬁcant.

The fact that my eight-year-
old cousin’s declaration that he
will one day be president is not
just cute but is now within the
realm of possibility, that is rea-

son enough to be proud.

It’s safe to say Dr. King and
Abraham Lincoln would be
proud, even if they were Repub-
licans.

I remember watching Tara
Wall, a black conservative and
CNN commentator, on Election
Night once it was obvious his-
tory had been made. She ‘was
her trying to balance her pride
in her heritage with her political
disagreements with the winning
candidate. Although we don’t
share a heritage we do share the
feeling of bitter-sweetrress she
expressed.

Whether you are a devout
Obama supporter or part of the
loyal opposition, January 20th
should still be acknowledged as
a tremendous day in our nation’s
history.

But let’s not get ahead of our-
selves. The dream is nowhere
near realized.

If Dr. King wanted us to be
judged not be the color of our
skin but by the content of our
character, and I, as well as many
other Americans, am proud of

Obama’s inauguration simply
because of the color of his skin,
then the dream can’t be complet-
ed. I am not saying it is wrong
to be proud of Obama for being
the ﬁrst black man elected presi-
dent, but the fact that this is still
something to be proud of means
we still have work to do before
we fulﬁll Dr. King’s dream.

The day black men, or Jewish
women, or Hindus, or Hispanics
get elected to high ofﬁce and we
don’t even think to mention it
was a great achievement simply
because of the way they looked
or the god they worshiped, is the
day we can say the dream came
true.

It is not the day we ignore
race, it is the day race doesn’t de-
ﬁne us and we don’t use race to
deﬁne others.

Racism will not end on Janu-
ary 20th. America’s original sin
of slavery will not be cleared
from our memory either. On that
day we should celebrate that we
are one step closer to realizing
Dr. King’s dream, but we have a
ways to go.

Story time in
Payne Hall

Prospective professor reads a
short selection from a story to
an eager W&L audience‘

By Katherlne Roberts
sun: warren

As part of her campus visit during her applica-
tion for a position in Ethnic American Literatures
and Fiction, Dr. Ivelisse Rodriguez read part of a
story to students and faculty Friday afternoon.

The campus visit, during which Rodriguez
also taught a sample class, is the ﬁnal phase in the
application process, according to English Depart-
ment Head Professor Lesley Wheeler. Rodriguez
is one of three ﬁnalists asked to visit campus fol-
lowing interviews in December, from an original
pool of about 100 applicants.

Rodriguez read the ﬁrst 14 pages of a 44-page
story, The Different Story. It is told from the point
of View of a Latin-American girl who is challenging
her mother’s cynical View on love.

In the story, the high school-aged narrator and
her friends grew up hearing their mothers’ warnings
not to trust men: “Marry, but don’t believe” in true

“Rodriguez 3 story is in keeping with a
recent trend of a dry, simple, tongue-in-

cheek style of American literature:

Andrea Null: iunlor

love. The idealistic daughters, who want to believe ‘

in love, discover the causes of their mother’s cyni-
cism: husbands who have left and ﬁiends who have
been ill-treated by men. They resolve to believe
that, despite their mothers’ anti-love stories, love
can exist. They consider themselves revolutionar-
ies, writing and performing their own poetry to their
mothers’ protests.

Rodriguez said that, later in the story, the nar-
rator will confront her own father and ask him him
why he left her mother. His response: “People make
too much of love.” Rodriguez said that, while her
personal views have shifted over the years she’s
been working on this story, she currently agrees
the most with the father. Love is a starting point
for everything that comes afterward.

“Rodriguez’s story is in keeping with a recent
trend of a dry, simple, tongue-in-cheek style of
American literature,” said junior Andrea Null, who
attended the reading.

Null, who is considering the new Creative
Writing minor, said she wanted to be familiar with
the work of candidates who could be her professors
in the future.

The students and faculty members in the
audience seemed to enjoy the reading, laughing
at the girls’ frustration with their more traditional
mothers.

Rodriguez also incorporated jokes and refer-
ences to Latino-American culture, and being part
of a smaller group within the greater society. At one
point, the mothers, ﬁercely proud of their heritage,
accuse the daughters of acting “the A word”—
American. Rodriguez said that her own mother,
like the mothers in the story, views every man as
suspect and prefers to follow the “old ways.”

However, while her characters are always
Latino, Rodriguez said she tries to appeal to a
broader audience. For example, the story she read
also has feminist and working-class aspects. The
revolutionary daughters draw from a community of
women who were treated poorly by men, regardless
of race or time.

And “men get shafted too,” she added, to
laughter from the audience. —

Rodriguez earned a PhD in Creative Writing
from the University of Illinois in 2006 and has
taught at several schools, most recently at the Coast
Guard Academy. She wrote a collection of short
stories for her dissertation, which is currently under
review for publication.

Myers’ final bow

Music professor is hasty resignation raises a few eyebrows

By Celeste Cruz-Carandang
ARTS&LlFE EDITOR

The Washington and
Lee campus always seems
to be ﬁlled with intrigue.

From the latest post
on Juicy Campus to the
incriminating pictures from
tear night, W&L is buzzing
with gossip.

Until now, most of
the rumors were about the
students. Fortunately for
some, the spotlight is now
shining on the faculty; the
music department in par-
ticular.

Dr. Jerry Myers, act-
ing director of choral ac-
tivities, resigned from his
position, at the beginning
of January. ' '

Although his students
were told that Myers had
been offered a better posi-
tion in St. Louis, some of
them. were still not satis-
ﬁed.

Sam Gilleran, a mem-
ber of the Chamber singers
and a former member of

' the University chorus com-

mented that, “When Myers
told us (chamber singers)
thathe was leaving. . .the
first thought that came
to my mind was that he
must have been told that he
wasn’t getting Doc Spice’s
old job...and I deﬁnitely
assumed, and others also
would imagine, that he
would be named the Direc-
tor [of choral activities] at
some future point.”

Christian Roden,
another member of the
Chamber Singers, said,
“He wasn’t going to get
tenured here but he was
going to get tenured in St.
Louis. We lost an excellent
choral director. It’s too bad
that he had to make a deci-
sion that was best for him
and that didn’t keep him at
Washington and Lee.”

Both Gilleran and
Roden admit that they
heard these things from

He had been with the
chorus since his graduation
in 2000.

He was also quite
close with Myers. Harvey
and Myers collaborated
on a number of W&L cho-
ral and theatrical perfor-
mances.

This spring’s tour to
South Africa was another
one of these collaborative
projects.

The tour was can-
celled soon after the de-

various sources of ques-
tionable reliability.

Other students felt
uncomfortable with the
situation and refused to
comment.

Adding to the mystery
surrounding Myers’ depar-
ture is Josh Harvey’s resig-
nation as the accompanist
of the University Chorus
and as a faculty member of
the music department.

Harvey also refused to
comment.

Harvey informed
students of his resignation
prior to the start of winter
term and weeks before My-
ers’ actual departure from
the University.

partment learned taht My-
ers had accepted another
position and was leaving
in January.

Dr. Spice, head of
the Music department, re-
vealed that there were also
problems with enrollment
for the tour.

“There are 51 students
registered in the Univer-
sity Chorus. Only about 16
signed up for the tour and
among those 16 were two
or three males. I felt that the
group could not adequately
represent W&L”

SpiceDespite the
small scandal surround-
ing Myers’ resignation,
the situation may have

simply been dramatized
by rumor. .

Spice feels that the
students’ discontent may
be based on rumor and not
fact. J .
“They don’t~fully"
understand the situation.‘
Many students think that
[Myers] already had the
job...we were required to
do a national search, and
Jerry, of course was one
of outstanding ﬁnalists for
it.”

Myers was then of— »
fered a j ob in St. Louis. The
position began in January.
According to Spice, “There -
were several reasons why
this position was attractive
to Jerry. “First, .1"
it is a very good job at.
a large institution. Most
importantly, it is in St.’
Louis. . .he ﬁnds himself 45

home.” g
Spice admits that the
university has lost a great
professor. “The chorus
made great strides under
Dr. Myers’ leadership.”

The University Cho-
rus is now under the direc-
tion of Dr. Robert Allen.
Allen taught at Mary Bald- A
win for over 30 years and‘
has over 40 years of con-
ducting experience. “We
were lucky to get him,”
said Dr. Spice. “It was quite
last minute.”

  ‘ Professor crosses cultural lines

W&L Journalism professor co—produces documentary “Crossing Lines ”

By Becky Guynn
STAFF WRITER

It is often said that Wash-
ington and Lee students have
the opportunity to truly_ get ac-
quainted with their professors.
We-will go into their oﬂices to
chat outside of ofﬁce hours, we
see them at exhibits, and may
sometimes have dinner at their
homes. However, Professor In-
dira Somani, let students get
toknow a little more about her
in the documentary “Crossing
Lines.”.

“Crossing Lines” was co-
produced by and featured
Washington and Lee journalism
professor Indira Somani and
American University professor
Leena Jayaswal. The ﬁlm is
the story of an Indian-American
woman, Somani, in her jour-
ney to ﬁnd her identity after the
death of her father. On her per-
sonal website, Somani describes
the ﬁlm as “a unique story about
the relationship of an Indian fa-

ther and his American born In-
dian daughter.”

The documentary has been
shown on many public televi-
sion stations, and at several ﬁlm
festivals. In January 2009 it won
the Best Documentary Award at
the California Arts Association
Digital Short Film Festival in
Cupertino, California. “Cross-
ing Lines” was also the runner
up for the Best Short Documen-
tary at the Baltimore Wornen’s
Film Festival in Baltimore,
Maryland for October 2008. Pe-
ter Bhatia, the executive editor
of The Oregonian, as quoted on
the ﬁlm’s Web Site, stated that
“It was a delight to experience
Crossing Lines and share in In-
dira Somani’s journey.”

The ﬁlm‘ follows Somani’s
travels to India after her father
passed away in 2002. In the
ﬁlm Somani explains how as an
Indian-American she never felt
extremely close to her Indian
heritage. “Your parents are your

connection to India,” said So-
mani in the ﬁlm. Growing up,
she was the ﬁrst Indian-Ameri-
can at her elementary school in
Springﬁeld, Illinois. Her father
was a medical professor who
maintained strong connections

complished and happy without
being married, so she brought
her friend Seema Goyal to be the
producer for India for the ﬁlm.
She spoke about having extend-
ed family in India and how nice
it is to have a large family that

even though she does not speak
Hindi like her family in India.
She said that the United States
can be isolating for many Indian-
Americans, but with the advance
of technology such as e-mail it
is easier to keep in contact. Be-
cause of the film, Somani made

her connection to India, through
her family and the love that she
found in them. She also felt that
she gave something back to her
family because they could see
her father in her.

The documentary made its
W&L debut on Thursday Janu-
ary 15. The Stackhouse Theater
was packed with journalism stu-
dents, students of all majors and
professors.

After the thirty minute docu-
mentary, English Professor Su-
zanne Keen led a question and
answer discussion. During the
discussion, Somani explained
that she was allotted an uncom-
mon degree of freedom because
her parents did not pressure her
to be religious.

When. asked how her_family
in India responded to the making
of the ﬁlm, she explained that
her father had always enjoyed
making home videos and this
was a way for her family to keep
his memory alive.

Somani revealed to the au-
dience that the ﬁlm took three
years to make and was very
draining emotionally. She ad-
vised anyone interested in mak-
ing a ﬁlm about their own life to
“be emotionally prepared.”

Somani began her professor-
ship at W&L this past fall. She
just completed a Ph.D. from
the Phillip Merrill College of
Journalism at the University
of Maryland, College Park, in
2008. Before receiving her
Ph.D., Somani was a news pro-
ducer for ten years at various sta-
tions, including CNBC in New
York, where she produced the
around the clock post September
11 coverage. She said that her
Indian family loved that she was
involved in television but also
respected that she wanted to fol-
low in her father’s footsteps and
be in academia.

usical group has old inspiration

The Good Pennyworths performed music that you ’ve never heard before

Bycaltlin Edgar
STAFF WRITER

’Today’s musical artists are
drawing on classic and retro
inspirations. Some will go back
as far as Buddy Holly and the
Beatles, others will turn to clas-
sics such as Etta James and Billy
to create chart—topping hits. The
Good Pennyworths, a unique
quartet, turned instead, to the
Golden Age of England.

On January 17, 2009 in Lee
Chapel, the Good Pennyworths
performed “Love, Lust, Long-
ing, Loss,” a vocal presentation
of Elizabethan lute songs.

Colorful period costumes il-
lustrated the historical context
of the songs, and the singers’
playful expressions visually

conveyed the meaning of the
old—fashioned lyrics.

The singers’ clear voices and
dramatic approach blended into
a beautiful and entertaining per-
formance.

Garald Famham, the bari-
tone, also accompanied the
quartet with the lute, a stringed
instrument which is somewhat
similar to the guitar, but has a
deep round back.

While descriptions such as
“Elizabethan” and “Renais-
sance” may sound formal and
dry to contemporary ears, the
ballads sung by the quartet were
laced with witty word plays,
sexual innuendos, and real hu-
man emotion.

popular music has changed very
little in the last few centuries.
The Good Pennyworths’ mu-
sic carries the same themes of
lust, humor, frustration, and pas-
sion that are woven into current

speare’s sonnets.

The connection to Shake-
speare is stronger than it ﬁrst
appears. The ballad, “Come
Live With Me and Be My
Love” was ﬁrst composed by

Christopher Marlowe, a rival of
Shakespeare’s, under the name,
“The Passionate Shepherd to His
Love.”

Marlowe sent the poem to his
friend, Sir Walter Raleigh, who
wrote a well-known poem in
response, called “The Nymph’s
Reply to The Shepherd.”

Shakespeare used portions
of Marlowe’s poem in “Merry
Wives.”

The orignal ballads were
often played by traveling min-
strels, who would tramp around
the countryside with their lutes,
playing for families, villages,
and even royalty.

Musicians passed their music
orally to other musicians, which
led to many variations within

each song. Some ballads even
have Appalachian versions that
can be traced to English immi-.
grants.

Each musician in the quar-
tet is conservatory-trained.
Between the four of them, the
quartet has diverse background
of performance in nearly every
music arena, from musicals to
absurdist operas to indie rock
bands. '

The vocal group, based in
NYC, was formed in 2007 in
an effort to show the appeal of
what is now considered “Early
Music” to modern audiences.

While currently recording
their ﬁrst studio album, the quar-
tet also hopes to release a live
Christmas CD.

Artist Ron Johnson uses unique mediums in his works

By Celeste Cruz-carandang
ARTS&L|FE EDITOR

Artists will usually begin a
talk with a short introduction:
the art school they went to, how
long they have beenworking as
an artist and what exactly in-
spired the exhibit. Ron Johnson,
whose drawings and painting
are currently on display in the
atrium of Lenfest, chose an en-
tirely different route. He told his
eager audience that he played
baseball at Ohio State, ++ in ar-

chitecture and played in a hard

rock band.

Johnson admitted, “I usually
like to start my talks in some
weird way.” But this somewhat
unusual introduction seemed to
ﬁt the artist. Like the beginning
of his lecture, Johnson’s work is
unique, to say the very least. “In
some way, I’m making some-
thing you’ve never seen,” said
the artist.

Johnson’s drawings are easily
spotted upon entering the atrium.
The ﬂoor-to-ceiling works seem
simple at ﬁrst glance. Indeed,
the swirls of color sometimes re-
semble long, elaborate scribbles.
Johnson attributes these shapes
to his days as baseball player. “I
based some work on the stitches

of a baseball.”

Should one look closely, the
intricacy of the drawings is re-
vealed. The piece is not simply
one sheet of paper, but is in-
stead a series of layered strips. It
seems that the artist could have
just kept going until the paper
was almost too heavy to hang.

colored swirls.

The work seems daunting,
considering the amount of time
he is hunched over with a pen
or paintbrush. “I do lots of cal-
isthenics beforehand,” joked the

‘ artist.

But the work does not stop
there. Johnson is tweaking his

 typically want to instigate questions and

problems. I want to get it outside the stereo-

type...I ’m really happy with what happened

out there. ’

Ron Johnson, artlst

However, Johnson relies on in-
stinct to create his aesthetic: “It
is one of those body of works
with the intuition of when to
stop...I really come from more
of a» minimal sensibility.”

The artist’s process is espe-
cially fascinating. His studio
ﬂoor is covered with long sheets
of Mylar paper reaching lengths
of up to 20 feet. Hexthen puts on
his socks, grabs a black sharpie
and begins to draw. Johnson
walks up and down the paper
until it is ﬁlled with black and

pieces right until the installation.
“I had to keep rearranging...
even here because there was al-
ways something unexpected. . .I
put together, I call them puzzles,
until I see something I like.”
Johnson is also working on a
series of works he calls objects.
“I’m interested in electrical tape
because it looks like paint.”
The use of unique mediums is a
theme of Johnson’s work. Along
with electrical tape, he has used
whiteout pens and sharpies. “I
like to see what these materials

can be outside of their tradition-
al use.”

During his talk, Johnson told
a story about a man who wanted
to buy one of his works. Before
naming a price, Johnson gave
this potential customer a humor-
ous set of instructions. “Well,
you go to Lowe’s, buy three
nails. . .and that’ll be $2,000.”

Like the artist, the exhibit
seems to have a sense of hu-
mor. The bright color palette,
whimsical shapes, and interest-
ing names engage the viewer in
an entirely different way. But
Washington and Lee seems to
like “different.”

Sophomore studio art major
Susie Robinson commented, ,“I
found it really interesting how
he uses colors and how he ex-
plores translucency. And also
the fact that he doesn’t ﬁnish the
piece until he installs them.”

It seems that Johnson’s dis-
tinctive style was enough to
please even the toughest critic:
Ron Johnson himself. “I typi-
cally want to instigate questions
and problems. I want to get it
outside the stereotype...I’m re-
ally happy with what happened
out there.”

Generals down Bullets

Both swimming teams beat Gettysburg

By Will Dorrance
SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee
men’s and women’s swimming
teams hosted a non-conference
dual meet Saturday against
Gettysburg.

The W&L men led from the
start and never looked back,
winning, convincingly 159-
100. Although the women’s
meet was much closer, the
Lady Generals still came out
on top, 135-127.

Senior captain Lindsey
Strachan, the 2008 ODAC
swimmer of the year, once
again paced the Generals by
winning two individual events
(200 back and 100 back) and
leading off the winning 200
medley relay team. Strachan’s
time of 2:09.53 in the 200
back earned her a pool record
that hadn’t been broken in 26
years. The other members of
the W&L winning 200 medley
relay team were junior Lyrm
Bazzel, senior Julianne Miata
and junior Sarah Simpson.

Strachan was not the only
individual W&L winner on the
day. Bazzel ﬁnished on top of
the 100 breast with a time of
1:09.75; Miata’s time of 25.83
in the 50 free earned her a
ﬁrst-place ﬁnish; and ﬁrst-year

Dana Fredericks touched ﬁrst
in the 200 breast with a time of

, 2230.62.

The win was the ﬁrst time
that the W&L women have
ever beaten Gettysburg.

On ‘the men’s side, senior

captain Paul Crook led the

Generals with two individual
wins and two relay wins. He
ﬁnished ﬁrst in the 100 free

(48.18) and the 200 indi-,

vidual medley (2:0l.98) and
was a member of the winning
teams in the 200 medley relay
(1240.31) and the 200 free re-
lay (1:3l.92). His teammates
in both of the relays were fel-
low senior captains Brett Tat-
man and Chris Diebold as well
as another senior Matt Ander-
son.

Additional ﬁrst-place win-
ners for the men were juniors
Nick Talluri in the 200 free
(1 :48.47), Winston Stagg in the
200 ﬂy (2201.62), lan Childers
in the 200 breast (2:16.53),
Dan Austin in the 500 free
(5201.42), sophomore Dorsey
Terry in the 100 ﬂy (55.39),
ﬁrst-years Ben Absher in the
1000 free (l0:28.32) and Brian
Stirling in the 50 free (22.29).

On Saturday morning, eight teams
gathered in the Warner Center for the
32nd annual Washington & Lee Wrestling
Invitational. With a few hundred people in
attendance, the gym was a bustle of excit-
ing activity.

The Generals ﬁnished fourth overall,
racking in a total of 83 points and claiming
the championship of two weight classes,
with one runner-up, one third place and one
fourth place ﬁnisher. The day would prove
to be an exciting one for the seniors and

ﬁrst-years, who carried the team.

W&L senior Rob Terrin had a remark-
able showing, coming out on top of the
165-pound weight class, winning two of
three matches by pin. Terrin pinned Wash-
ington & Jefferson’s John Sabatelli (3:36)
in the championship match.

Another W&L senior, John Christo-
pher, ﬁnished 3-0 in the 285-pound weight
class, notching one pin against Johns Hop-
kins’ Matt Rugani in the ﬁnals, 5-2, in an
impressive, hard-fought matchup.

F irst-year David Dennis received a
ﬁrst-round bye at 149 pounds, pinning
Waynesburg’s Jesse Byerly, who was the

n their weight classes

top seed in the group, in the third minute.
Ultimately, Dennis fell to Rob Kein of
Muhlenberg in the ﬁnal match, 3-1, in a
no-less impressive battle.

After dropping his initial match, ﬁrst-
year Ben Ersing ﬁnished the day 2-1 over-
all at 125 pounds. He came back to defeat
Waynesburg’s Josh Klimko in the third
place match, 16-3.

At 133 pounds, ﬁrst-year Sam Camp-
bell, who has a season record of 7-4 thus
far, completed his day 2-2 overall, ulti-
mately falling to Johns Hopkins’ Michael
Testa in the third-place match, 3-2.

When asked about his performance that
day, Campbell was happy with his result,
acknowledging that while there was some
work to do, he tried his hardest. “I did
pretty well, today,” Campbell said, “and
I’m going to continue to look toward the
future; we’ve got plenty of matches left to
show what we’ve really got.”

Waynesburg ﬁnished ﬁrst with a total
of 123 points, followed by Washington
& Jefferson in second and Johns Hopkins
close after in third. In order, Muhlenberg,
West Virginia Tech and Scranton ﬁnished
in the middle, while Southern Virgnia ﬁn-
ished last with 25 points. W&L placed
second of the three Centennial Conference
members that were in attendance.

W&L, who currently sits at the top of
the Centennial Conference, will see its
next action this Saturday as the Gener-
als travel to Stevens Institute of Technol-
ogy in Hoboken, NJ, where there will be
a tri-toumament with McDaniel and the
Merchant Marine Academy, beginning at
10:00 am.

Women’s basketball loses heartbreaker
Lady Generals fall to Bridgewater 69- 70 on last-second shot

By Russweems
STAFF WRITER \

On Saturday, the Washington & Lee
women’s basketball team took on ODAC
foe Bridgewater in an away game. The
Generals fell to the Eagles 69-70 in a
back-and-forth game.

Both teams came into the game with
identical conference records of 5-3. On
paper, this was a very evenly matched con-
test, and it didn’t disappoint on the court.

Bridgewater jumped out to an early

lead 10-4, but the Generals fought back. ,

They consistently chipped away at the ad-
vantage throughout the ﬁrst half. W&L
used a 12-1 run and hot three-point shoot-
ing to take the lead. First-year forward
Rebecca Bolton capped off the half by
scoring the Generals last ﬁve points going
into the break. The Generals led 40-29 at
halftime.

The game was relatively even through;
out the beginning of the second half. The
Generals held a 10-point lead with 14:35 to
play. After this point, Bridgewater started
cutting into the W&L advantage. By the
10:31 mark, the lead was down to four. At
5:32, Bridgewater took its ﬁrst lead of the
second half. W&L had cooled off from

long range in the second half. The Gener-
als went 2 for 8 (25 percent) from 3-point
range in the second half after a 5 for 10 (50
percent) ﬁrst.

The Bridgewater comeback set the
game up for an exciting conclusion. Nei-
ther team was able to gain a signiﬁcant
advantage down the stretch.

With 17 seconds to play, the Generals
led 69-68 and went to the line for a 1-and-
1. W&L missed the ﬁrst shot, which was
rebounded by Bridgewater sophomore
guard Jordan Buckholder. Buckholder
took the ball down the court and took a
jumper with seven seconds to play. The
shot missed, but Bridgewater’s sophomore
guard Bianca Booker grabbed the rebound
and hit a fade-away jumper with 3.1 sec-
onds left to give the Eagles a 70-69 lead.

W&L passed the ball in to sophomore
guard Allie Long who attempted a last
‘second heave. The shot was off-target and
the game was over. The ﬁnal score was
70-69 as the Generals lost in heartbreak-
ing fashion.

W&L’s defense was a bright spot
throughout the game. The Generals held
the Eagles to 42 percent from the ﬁeld and
forced 22 turnovers including 13 steals.
Three-point shooting also helped the Gen-

erals out; they shot 39 percent from long
distance.

Rebounds and free throws were weak
spots for W&L. The Eagles outrebounded
the Generals by 10, 46-36, and W&L only
made 53.3 percent of its shots from behind
the foul line.

The Generals were led by four players
in double digits. Bolton contributed 18
points _and 10 rebounds, her fourth dou-
ble-double of the season. Senior guard
Bethany Ridenhour added 12 points on 5
of 10 shooting. First-year guard Kari Ann
Pfannenstein ended up with 11 points on
3 of 6 shooting from three-point range.
Sophomore center Felice Herman also
scored 10 points.

With the close loss, the Generals look
forward to facing the Eagles again in Feb-
ruary. The Generals will look to have a
stronger start in the rematch then play hard
for 40 minutes. “We have played a lot of
close games this year and will be more
prepared for Bridgewater when we play
them again,” said Pfannenstein.

The loss dropped the Generals to 5-4 in
the ODAC and 5-8 overall. The Generals
return to action on Tuesday as they host
Hollins for a 7:00 p.m. home game.
