VOLUME CXII, NUMBER 2

BY THE STUDENTS AND FOR THE 1897

School agrees to contract
with B2 Networks to stream

games live on Internet

By Wlll Dorrance

SPORTS EDITOR

Washington and Lee University has agreed
to a multi-year contract with B2 Networks to
stream live video and audio feeds of athletic
contests over the Internet. The ﬁrst broadcasted
game of this school year was the volleyball game
on Wednesday against Eastern Mennonite Uni-
versity.

Games will be available on the school’s web-
site and on B2 Network’s streaming website
(www.b2tv.com). The broadcast requires a high-
speed Internet connection as well as a current
version of Microsoft Windows Media Player.

According to W&L Sports Information Di-
rector Brian Laubscher, this process has been in
the planning stages for about a year and a half.
Laubscher said that the athletic department has
been “thinking about it for a while but wanted to
make sure we had the infrastructure set in place.”
The department needed to secure the correct
technological equipment, ﬁnd camera operators,
and network all the press boxes with Internet.

To make the project more manageable, Laub-

“B2 Networks is the industry
leader in television-style broad-
casting on the Internet We
can use it not only for athletic
events but also  graduation,
Mock'Convention, plays and

other University events. ”

I Brlan Laubscher, W&L Sports Informatlon

Dlrector
 

scher “pulled several departments. together.”

The Office of Public Affairs and Communica- ‘

tions is providing the cameras for recording the
games, journalism students will be the camera
operators and the Office of University Develop-

ment helped raise the necessary funds to kick off

the project.

While season packages are available, indi-
vidual games will cost $7 with W&L and B2
Networks splitting the revenue evenly. W&L
will use the money to pay camera operators and
purchase better equipment in the future.

Laubscher said that the athletic department
will stream “a fair amount of games, but we don’t
want to overextend ourselves.” Five football
games, four men’s soccer games, four women’s
soccer games, four ﬁeld hockey games, and four
volleyball matches will be broadcasted this fall.
Laubscher didrecognize the possibility of add-
ing more games to the schedule in the future.

Last spring, the school conducted a successful
one-game test of a men’s lacrosse game between
W&L and Hampden-Syndney. Viewers of the
live stream satisfactorily evaluated the service.

W&L chose to partner with B2 Networks
partly because of the ﬂexibility that the com-
pany provides. W&L has control of the airtime
and can run commercials, messages, or notes
to alumni groups during half-time or time-outs.
Additionally, Laubscher noted, “We can use it
not only for athletic events but also can stream
graduation, Mock Convention, plays, and other
University events.”

Furtherrn_ore, the school also elected B2 Net-
works because W&L only needs to send one
feed of the games to B2 Networks, who will dis-

Addressing rural poverty

$90, 000 grant creates I 5 new internships in Arkansas

By Katherlne Roberts
STAFF WRITER

The Shepherd Poverty Alliance
recently received a $90,000 grant
from Southern Financial Partners, a
nonproﬁt organization that focuses
on economic revitalization, to expand
the alliance’s internship program in
Phillips County, Ark. The grant will
provide for 15 internships by 2010,
according to Coordinator of Co-Cur-
ricular Education Fran Elrod.

The grant also introduces a part-
nership between the Shepherd Alli-
ance and the Delta Bridge Project,
a community-driven initiative that
funnels money into non-proﬁt agen-
cies that help stimulate the local
economy, Elrod said.

The] Mississippi Delta region,
over an hour’s drive from Memphis,
Tenn., has suffered economically
since cotton and other forms of agri-
culture left the area, Elrod said. The
county seat, Helena, is one of the
poorest cities in America with a me-
dian income of $19,896 in 2000 ac-
cording to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Junior James Dick, who partici-

pated in the 8-week internship this
summer, said the level of poverty in
the Delta region is similar to that of a
third-world country. “It is not a huge
overstatement,” he said.

W&L students in the Shepherd

“I wanted to go to a. place that
would stretch my ideas of...what
it means to be happy and content,”
Dick said.

Dick worked at the Phillips Coun-
ty Boys & Girls Club, playing games

“I wanted to go to a place that would stretch my

ideas of what it means to be happy and con-

tent. ”

 

Alliance began working in Phillips
County four years ago, following
encouragement from active W&L
alumni in Arkansas. Last year, six
interns went to work with local or-
ganizations.

To appreciate what working pov-
erty means in the area, the interns
lived on $11 a day. That means “a
lot of peanut butter, honey and ba-
nana sandwiches,” said junior James
Dick, who completed an internship
in Phillips County last summer.

such as ping-pong, pool and kickball
with local children. This gave them a
place to go during the day while their
parents worked.

One of the biggest indicators
of poverty in the region was a lack
of education, Dick said. While the
children had basic necessities like
clothes and shoes, they did not know
about dental hygiene or healthy food
choices.

As part of his internship, Dick
ran a “Cavity-Free Zone” at the club

where children learned about dental
health by cutting holes in an apple
and ﬁlling up its “cavities.” He said
that many kids had ﬁllings.

Junior Megan Steinhardt ran a
summer day camp for kids aged six
to 14 that focused on nutrition and
physical activity.

One component of the program
was introducing kids to foods such
as broccoli, celery and blueber-
ries, which many of them had never
eaten. “These are things we take for
granted,” said Steinhardt.

The philosophy of the organiza-
tion was that change could be im-
plemented by teaching the children
better eating habits, Steinhardt ex-
plained.

Steinhardt said she was most
struck by the “cycle of poverty.”
Most members of the community are
in the ﬁfth, sixth or seventh genera-
tion of their families to live in Phil-
lips County.

“It was almost like they were
stuck in the town,” she said.

W&L students get the Vote out

Student political organizations offer T-shirts and advice on voter registration

By Anne Vesoulls
STAFF wmrsn

The College Democrats and
Republicans at Washington and
Lee are developing different
techniques to get the word out on
student voting both locallyand
nationally for the November 4
Presidential Election.

Erika Rost, co-chair of the
College Republicans, and other
members of the club have been
working on coordinating events
to inform the public, includ-
ing a T-shirt sale at the Parents’
Weekend football game to pro-
mote Senator McCain and other
Republican candidates in the
upcoming election. The club will
also distribute buttons and bum-
per stickers to promote the Mc-
Cain-'Palin Campaign. I

Likewise, the College.Demo—
crats are promoting voter regis-
tration across campus.

“We are helping to register
students to vote in Virginia and

, also campaigning in and around
Lexington by phone bank-
ing and canvassing for Barack
Obama, Mark Warner, and Sam

Rasoul” said Rebecca Guyrm,
co-chair of the College Demo-
crats.

The College Democrats are
putting a heavy emphasis on get-
ting students to vote because of
the high degree to which college
students can affect the election’s
outcome both at the polls and at
voting promotion events.

“We believe that students
will play an important role in
the election with our votes _and
the potential votes of the citi-
zens of Rockbridge County that
we can achieve by working
in the community. Also, with
more students across the country
forming groups such as Students
for Barack Obama, activism is
growing on campuses and could
produce a signiﬁcant student
turnout on campuses" across the
country,” Guynn said.

“I’m excited to be a part of
such a groundbreaking election
and can’t wait to get more in-
volved in the political scene on
the Washington and Lee campus
during my time here,” said ﬁrst-
year Keturah Nichols.

Hall.

“There just wasn’t enough
money to do the whole building,”
Taylor said.

The University compromised,
allowing the main ﬂoor renova-
tion to go ahead for a mere $2.5
million while the lower floors
would stay as they are with the
exception of the new technical
services oﬂice on the first ﬂoor.

In April, architects from SFCS,
Inc. presented their plans for a
physical and thematic redesign of
the main ﬂoor. The plans called
for obstructive walls to be taken
down, the ceiling to be raised and
worn fumiture and carpeting to be
replaced with modern designs and
styles.

The renovation is intended to
create public, collaborative spac-
es toward the front of the build-
ing and quieter study areas in the
back.

The open plan will allow the
circulation desk, renamed the “In-
formation Desk,” to be relocated
to the center of the room. The
Information Desk will serve as a
“one-stop shop’-’ for library users’
needs, according to SFCS plans.

On the west side facing the

Commons, a second entrance
will provide a convenient access
point to the most public part of
the library, where couches and
armchairs, periodical display
racks and a small cafe’ with a cof-
fee station and vending machines
will provide an alternative to the
Commons living room.

Two classrooms, four study
rooms, research and IT services
will line the back and sides of the
library. Rows of reference mate-
rials, arrnchairs and an abundance
of group study tables will be nest-
ed in the middle. To the left of the
main entrance, an art exhibit will
welcome visitors and reinforce
the modern, chic feel that the ar-
chitects hope to cultivate.

Construction on the main ﬂoor
began in June shortly after the end
of the school year. The renova-
tion is scheduled to be ﬁnished
sometime in January 2009. Tay-

lor said construction is proceed-
ing at a very fast pace.

Taylor said she has not heard
a single objection to the renova-
tions from students or faculty.
Sophomore Jamie Kim was one
of the students asked by library
staff how the library could be im-
proved. Kim suggested brighter
lights and a display rack for vid-
eos and DVDs, which were inac-
cessible prior to the renovation.

While Kim is not a “regular”
in the library, she does plan to in-
crease her use of the main ﬂoor
when it is ﬁnished. “It should be a
deﬁnite plus,” she said. “I’ll have
to see how it’s going to be when
it’s all ﬁnished, but I’m excited.”

Brent Meyers, a junior, said
the redesign of the main ﬂoor
would be an improvement but not
a permanent ﬁx of what many stu-
dents consider to be an outdated,
unattractive building.

“I never thought it was great

architecture,” Meyers said. “I.

think as a temporary measure it’s
going to be a good thing. . .I think
what’s needed is to tear it down
and start from scratch.”

A total reconstruction of the
library is still far off, according to
Taylor. The building, which was
opened in 1979, is still relatively
young by architectural measures
and is likely to remain in use for
decades unless a large donation
allows for its replacement.

Not all opinions swing away\

from the block and brick build-
ing, however.

Sam Shore, an exchange stu-
dent from the University of St.
Andrews in Scotland, feels that
while the library may be archi-
tecturally anachronistic, it is
functional. Shore can relate—at
his home university, a thoroughly
modern library similar to Leybum
is surrounded by 15th century
buildings.

“Not every building is going to
be aesthetically nice,” Shore said.
“You go to the library for what’s
on the inside.”

of North Carolina, Connecticut,

W&L professor challenges Virginia lottery

Claims the lottery “knowingly and deliberately ” provided

By Patrick Scully
STA FF WRITER

A recent lawsuit against the Virginia
Lottery has put the local and national
spotlight on a member of the Washing-
ton and Lee community.

Professor Scott Hoover ﬁled a law-
suit after questioning whether the Vir-
ginia Lottery has been entirely honest in

» its gaming practices.

In early August 2007, Hoover walked
into the Stop—ln on South Main Street
and bought a “Beginners Luck” scratch-
off ticket. Hoover, not a regular buyer of
lottery tickets, was counting on having
more than luck on his side.

A fellow professor had recently in-
formed Hoover of a “very good invest-
ment” opportunity in lottery tickets.
According to the lottery’s website, ap-
proximately half of the grand prizes still
remained unclaimed despite the fact that
over 90 percent of the scratch-off tickets
had already been sold.

The professors calculated that this
statistical anomaly made each ticket,
retailing at $5, worth about $7 each.

Poverty

Being a professor of Applied Business
Statistics, Investments and “Puzzles and
Critical Thought”, Hoover instantly rec-
ognized a potential for proﬁt.

He was not surprised when his first
few tickets came up empty. But af-
ter buying tickets at several locations

able to prove that in fact there was pre-
cisely zero chance to win because the
grand prize winners had already been
claimed.” Hoover felt this to be a clear
violation of the contract between the lot-
tery and its participants, which claims
that each ticket has a chance to win the

series of Freedom of Information Act requests, we

were able to prove that in fact there was precisely Zero

Scott Hoover, Lawrence Prof. of Business Administration

around the state with little to show for
it, Hoover began to question the con-
sistency of the lottery’s data. “The data
was simply wrong or the prizes were not
being distributed randomly,” he said.
“After an extensive statistical
analysis and ﬁling a series of Freedom
of Information Act requests, we were

grand prize.

“A bigger issue to me was that the
Lottery had knowingly and deliberately
posted false data on its website to dis-
guise the fact that no grand prizes were
available,” Hoover said. I

He hired several attorneys, some

of whom are alumni of the W&L Law

School

“We went with W&L attorneys be-
cause they came highly recommended
and because we presumed they would
be men of honor and integrity,” he said.

Hoover’s attorneys presented their
case to the office of the Virginia At-
tomey General. Hoover said he merely
wished to remedy the situation and
make the terms of the lottery more clear
to its participants. When lottery ofﬁcials
failed to act, Hoover and his attorneys
decided to make the then private dispute
a fully publicized affair.

They ﬁled a class-action lawsuit
against the Virginia Lottery hoping to
ensure that information about available
prizes is clearly presented to partici-
pants in future scratch-off games and to
compel the lottery to return the estimat-
ed $84.7 million dollars it had collected
under allegedly false pretences.

Hoover maintains that he is not pur-
suing this case for ﬁnancial gain other
than a refund of his ticket purchases.

“My stake in this is just over $100,”
he said. “My purpose is simply the pur-

false information

suit of integrity in govemment.”

Hoover’s case has already caught the
attention of the public in Virginia and
around the country.

Segments about the lawsuit have
appeared on local radio stations and
newspapers, “Good Morning America,”
Washingtopost.com and even on the
CNN and Fox news networks. Hoover
also recently taped an episode of the
Dr. Phil show which is scheduled to air
on September 25 featuring his and two
other cases.

For now, the case remains unre-
solved. The Virginia Lottery still up-
holds the integrity of its contests and no
court date has been set.

Hoover feels he has accomplished
his goal of bringing this issue into the
public eye and setting up a dialogue for
future reform. “We still hope that the
Lottery will do the right thing, in which
case a lawsuit will not be necessary,” he
said.

“A lot of them hadn’t been out of the state
of Arkansas. . .They didn’t have the opportunity
to.”

education rates among the adults furthered the
problem, she said, because workers were often
not qualiﬁed enough to work elsewhere or attain
higher-paying jobs.

Yet, in spite of their poverty, the kids still had
fun, Dick said.

“They weren’t stuck there feeling sorry for
themselves. They were able to go outside and
play basketball,” he said.

With the money from the new grant, the
Shepherd Alliance will place interns in more or-
ganizations, including working with adult edu-
cation programs at a local community college.

“The students really bond and develop long-
lasting friendships,” Elrod said, "not only with
themselves but with the community."

POliticizingAmerican dreams

‘American dreams ’ don ’t just belong toone party; Obama should knowbetter

By Abel Delgado
COLU M NIST

Democrats have long claimed,
sometimes rightfully, that Re-
publicans use the War on Terror
as a way to scare voters into vot-
ing Republican.

Fair or not, Republicans have
argued that Democrats have been
soft on America’s enemies since
the Carter administration.

Republican attacks On the »

patriotism of veterans like John
Kerry and Max Cleland have not
only been unfair, they have been
shameful.

But now the Democrats have
found a way to return the favor
with an even more shameful at-
tack.

By saying that “under eight
years of Bush and McCain,
the American dream is slip-
ping away,” Democratic Vice
Presidential candidate Joe Biden
didn’t just insinutate that Repub-
licans were weak on America’s
biggest enemies.

By warning that the “reckon-
ing is now,” and that this elec-
tion “may be our last chance to
reclaim the America we love, to

restore America’s soul,” Biden
insinuated Republicans them-
selves were the enemy.
According to the rhetoric of
Obama’s running mate, Repub-
licans are the biggest threat to a

what Obama’s campaign surro-
gates and the attack dogs from
the Democratic Convention have
to say.

Democrats are using the
American Dream the same way
they accused Republicans of.us-
ing American Security during
past elections.

They are fear—mongering for
votes.

If the American Dream is dy-

cades of freedom in his adopted
country -- America -- he recently
became an American citizen.

' Joining him were over 2,000
new Americans from over 100
different countries, all with dis-
tinctly American dreams.

This was just one day in one
city.

Imagine how many Ameri-
can Dreams came true across the
country that day.

Imagine how many American
dreams came true that week.

happen for over 232 years now.

NO one who knows and re-
spects the American Dream will
tell you we need a politician to
save it.

Any politician who promotes
himself as the savior of the
American Dream obviously has
no respect for its resiliency.

The American Dream does
not need Barack Obama.

Electing him or John McCain
will not restore America’s soul.

Because America does not

need a savior.

It needs a President.

Washington is broken, not
America.

America will remain unbro-
ken as long as we have millions
of people seeking their Own ver-
sions of the American Dream
here.

The American Dream I know
will continue to endure regard-
less of who gets elected in No-
vember.

John McCain or Barack
Obama - it wOn’t matter for the
American Dream.

To claim otherwise is shame-
ful.

Of course, Barack Obama’s
story could be called the embodi-
ment of the American Dream. It
often has been, in fact.

But so could John McCain’s
life story. And that’s just the
thing about the American dream
- no one party or politician owns
it.

No party has a monopoly on
securing America and no party
has a monopoly on securing the
American Dream.

The American Dream I know

is about educational opportuni-
ties, not across the board entitle-
ment programs.

It’s about a government small
enough to get out of your way,
not big enough to be your only
obstacle.

It’s about individual ingenu-
ity, not government intervention.

I have always believed in the
American Dream just like my
grandfather taught me.

We believe the American
Dream is a product of the Ameri-
can People, not of the American
government.

This is part of the reason why
my grandfather and I are voting
in our ﬁrst presidential election
for a person and not a party.

This is why I am voting for
a person who has not only lived
the American Dream,,I am vot-
ing for a person who understands
the American Dream.

I am voting for the person
who actually does “get it.”

There 3 nothing special about Bristol Palin is baby

By Ben Absher
COLUMNIST

Even with the billions of
dollars poured into sexual ab-
stinence education every year,
sex before marriage still hap-
pens.

Often with the help of al-
cohol, young men and women
can get caught up in the heat
of the moment and the ability
to make smart decisions disap-
pears.

but not one that is implausibly
rare.

As college students not
much older than Bristol her-
self, we can sympathize with
her predicament.

We’ve all probably known
a few pregnant teenagers.

This is not exclusively the
stuff of Hollywood tabloids.

And like the other thou-
sands and thousands of preg-
nant teenage girls in America,
Bristol Palin made a decision
and now she has to live with

old who made choices that got
her pregnant, however you
feel about those choices.

They are different individ-
uals capable of making their
own decisions.

Think of it like this: how
many of your parents taught
you not to drink underage,
smoke, or have sex before
marriage?

Most of us have heard these
values preached at length since
grade school.

However, despite our par-

NO matter how you feel about McCain 3 pick, it is still a shame

that media outlets are tearing apart the values of the Republican

Party by keeping Bristol Palin is pregnancy in the news... Taking

advantage of a pregnant, unwed I 7-year-old is low—class...

Girls get pregnant.

The issue of teen preg-
nancy is not one to be taken
lightly, of course, but worse, it
is often overlooked as a major
problem.

According to the Centers
for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC), teen pregnan-
cies rose between 2005. and
2006 for the ﬁrst time since
1991, with 435,427 births in
2006 to mothers aged 15 — 19
years.

With that number so high,
what makes the pregnancy
of Bristol Palin - Republican
Vice-Presidential nominee
Sarah Palin’s unwed 17 year-
Old daughter - any more impor-
tant than the other 435,426?

Nothing. .

Bristol Palin isn’t too far
from being an average teen-
aged girl in an average family.

Yes, her “Juno” oriented
lifestyle has /put her in a situ-
ation that is less than ideal,

the consequences of that deci-
sion.

Those consequences in-
volve the burden Of taking
care of a child without a solid
ﬁnancial backing, the difﬁ-
culty of figuring out how to
attend college to further her
education, and isolation from
her non-parent friends.

These consequences are
understandable and unavoid-
able.

She, her child’s father, and
even her family all have to
live with her decision’s conse-
quences.

However, one consequence
of her choice she should not
have to face is the criticism
of her 44 year-old mother, the
Republican Vice Presidential
nominee.

Let us be clear on this
point.

Sarah Palin is not her
daughter Bristol.

Sarah Palin isn’t a 17 year

ents’ attempts to instill these
ideals in us, how many of us
do participate in at least one Of
these activities?

When you consider things
in that light you can under-
stand how little connection
there is between Bristol’s ac-
tions and her mother’s conser-
vative views and values.

Does Bristol Palin’s preg-
nancy have an effect on the
McCain-Palin campaign? Un-
fortunately, yes.

Sen. McCain took a bold
step by announcing Palin as
his running mate.

The maverick Republican
realized that he does not have
the rhetoric or showmanship
to appeal’ to the people that
Sen. Obama does.

He chose the candidate
who would best help him ﬁll
those voids.

He chose Palin to help lev-
el the ground between people
and politics—tO de-idolize the

political persona.

This was also an attempt to
draw Hillary supporters away
from Obama.

"I he irony is his decision to
go for broke and select Palin
as his running mate may have
further alienated many femi-
nists and pro-choice moder-
ates who were teetering on the
political fence.

But no matter how you feel
about McCain’s pick, it is still
a shame that mediaoutlets are
tearing apart the values of the
Republican Party by keeping
Bristol Palin’s pregnancy in
the news.

Any attempt to exploit Sar-
ah Palin’s daughter should be
considered low-class and dis-
respectful.

Taking advantage of a
pregnant, unwed 17 year is
low-class and disrespectful,
regardless of your political
leanings. I

You may Or may not have
the same views as the GOP,
but we are all human, and as
humans we deserve respect re-
gardless of our opinions.

Barack Obama’
jumped on this train, stating
that “people’s families are off
limits, and people’s children
are especially off limits. This
shouldn’t be part of our poli-

75

CVCII

tics.

Conservative or liberal, we
should all follow Barack’s ad-
vice, at least on this issue.

It’s time to leave Bristol
Palin alone.

Dragons take the stage

Golden Dragon Acrobats perform at
Keller theater, entertain a full house

By Stephanie Hardiman
STAFF WRITER '

By Valaree Tang
STAFF WRITER

Holekamp Hal1’s McCarthy
Gallery is hosting “From Life.”
This is an exhibition often paint-
ings by Tania Karpowitz. The
gallery is open to all members
of the Washington and Lee com-
munity as well as the residents of
Lexington and Rockbridge coun-
ty from 8:30 until 5:00 p.m.

The exhibit features oil paint-
ings on‘ both linen and canvas.
There are eight pieces for sale,
and two that were obtained from
private collectors. Surprisingly,
merely eight days after the ex-
hibit opened, the first painting,
“Roger in Rocking Chair” was
already sold. ’

Karpowitz’s work depicts

honest yet aggressive subjects.
She chose to portray these sen-
timents through her technical
skills regarding light and color.
“My work is about character
study. My method develops
through continual pursuit of
ways to make color, light, space
and gesture generate dramatic
tension, tell stories, and pose
provocative questions about the
person I’m painting,” Karpowitz
wrote in her statement. ,

The artist portrayed her ex-
pository style in “Marjorie,” a
portrait of a middle-aged wom-
an. The stark and serious expres-
sion of the ﬁgure, demonstrated
by the use of shading and the
subject’s facial expression, told
viewers the story that the subject

The Lenfest Center for the Arts kicked off its performance
season Thursday night with a visit from the Golden Dragon
Acrobats. This unique performance was a mixture of contor-
tionism and rhythmic gymnastics, complete with awe-inspir-
ing stunts. 0

Each of the 415 seats in Keller Theatre was ﬁlled for the

8:00 p.m. performance, and a waiting list for tickets began
weeks ago. Members of both the University and the sur-
rounding community were in attendance. Washington and
Lee professors and students, along with Rockbridge area
residents, children of all ages were in attendance.

The Chinese performing troupe is critically-acclaimed. It
has toured all over the world and has earned a number of
awards following a stint on Broadway. The Golden Acrobats
were then received with a standing ovation in Lexington.

Chinese acrobatics dates back to the Xia Dynasty, over
4,000 years ago. Centuries later, acrobatics became a popular
form of entertainmentfor Chinese emperors. Everyday items
such as plates and jars were common in these routines.

The Golden Dragon performers acknowledge this rich his-
tory of Chinese acrobatics by juggling common items such
as volleyballs, parasols, tables, and large painted pots with
their feet. Dressed in colorful, ornate costumes, the troupe
danced and perfomied for nearly two hours to Asian-inspired
and new—age music.

Performers showed a combination of poise and mind-blow-
ing strength scene after scene. They made it all look effortless.

“I almost had a heart attack,” said sophomore Hannah Kollef
after the performance. “I thought it would be ﬂips and stuff. I
did not expect that,” she said, referring to the acrobat who bal-
anced on one hand atop a ‘30-foot stack of chairs just feet away
from the crowd.

During another act, women twirled six to eight plates on long
rods while they danced to music. At the same time, gymnasts
bent their bodies over double into symmetrical formations. A
ballerina even did pointe workon the outstretched arm of her
male counterpart.

Audible “oohs” and “aahs” were heard throughout the the-
ater in response to feats truly indescribable and best viewed
ﬁrst-hand.

Junior Tim Kirby saw the troupe perform on a trip to New
York City. “I thought it would be a circus act,” he said. “Seeing
it live, you feel the energy; you see it is taxing on their bodies.
The amount of work they must put in is unimaginable.”

Work of this caliber was seen from the Chinese in the re-
cent Olympic Games in Beijing. The Chinese Olympic team
medaled in synchronized group events such as synchronized
divingfgyinnastics, and trampoline.

Professor Joan O’Mara, a member of the East Asian Studies
Program, was reminded of the Olympics when she took both of
her classes to the act. She believes in the importance of teach-
ing Asian studies to broaden ‘students’ horizons beyond Western
culture.

“China is on the scene internationally  It’s important for stu-
dents to get out of this Euro-centric world mindset,” she said.
O’Mara emphasized that ancient China provided things to the
world, likejpaper and the printing press, that many people are
unaware of.

Box office volunteer Linda Cummings said she expects many
other Lenfest events to sell out this year, including performances

by the Russian National Ballet as well as “Footloose” and “The

Secret Garden.”

The Golden Dragon Acrobats will be touring all over the
country through December. Their full tour schedule along with
video performances can be accessed on their website, www.gol-
dendragonacrobatscom.

Christine Carr is photographs displayed in the Williams School gallery

By Victoria Taylor
sun warren

Washington and Lee has
brought the work of yet an-
other artist to our campus.
The creations of photogra-
pher Christine Carr will be
on display for all to view in
the Williams School.

The works will be on
display from 8:30 until 5:00
p.m., Monday through Fri-
day. Carr’s' exhibit, entitled
“Christine “Carr: Threshold
and Portal,” will be in the
gallery until January ﬁfth.

The color collection,
“Threshold,” contains imag-
es from an ongoing body of
work that Carr said began in
2003 on a driving trip. In an
introduction for the exhibition
of this series of photographs,
the William W. Parker Gal-
lery said of Carr’s work, “Her
dramatic images are not ma-
nipulated by a computer, but
rather by using long exposure
times. Carr takes advantage
of time, light and the environ-
ment that she photographs to
create ethereal landscapes. . .
The subjects themselves are

quite ordinary. Industrial
landscapes, buildings and
other structures were among
them. Yet, Carr photographed
them in an interesting and
captivating manner.”

The artist wished her audi-
ence to actively participate in
the viewing of “Threshold.”
That is to say, Carr wanted to
capture viewers in a different
and innovative manner.

“[The] key to the work is
the idea of escapism- through
process and imagination,”
Carr said in an interview with
Rockbridge Weekly. “While
these images are documents
of structures, my intention is
for the work to move toward
the imaginary or emotionally
evocative.”

Carr’s work also had a
deﬁnite point of view. She
expressed this through her
technical choices.“With this
work I am contemplating
some possibilities in indus-
trial and urban environments,
in particular, non-descript ar-
eas upon which the effects of
composition, light and color
become transformative.”

The exhibition has two se-

ries of photographs. Thresh-
old was the ﬁrst of these, but
it is followed by the second
half of the exhibition: Portal.
According to Carr, “Por-
tal,” the collection of black
and white photography, ex-
plores the idea of “intention-
ally ambiguous” portal-areas
of light. Like “Threshold,”
“Portal” is more than just a
collection of images.

The photography exhibit
seems to have been well re-
ceived by the W&L commu-
nity.

In a place as heavily traf-
ﬁcked as the Williams School,
the works are extremely ac-
cessible to many students
and faculty members. “I am
very happy that the univer-
sity thinks it important to

bring contemporary art work

said junior Michael O’Brien.
“These are great diversions

Nabors sponsors fair

Service league hosts second annual
community volunteer service fair

By Jen Snyder
STAFF WRITER

The Nabors Service League
is bringing the second annual
Community Volunteer Fair to the
Washington and Lee community.
On Tuesday, September 16, from
11-2 students will be able to ex-
plore about 13 organizations that
provide service opportunities for
W & L students.

It is an event organized and
run very much like the activities

“Our goal is to make
community service ac-
cessible and rewarding
for every interested in-
dividual and to spread
interest campus wide.
Everyone is welcome to

attend and "enjoy... ”

Nabors Servlce League

fair. Each organization will have
a table set up on Cannan Green.
However, instead of the array of
student clubs and groups, it in-
cludes a number of service organi-
zations. Some of the associations
and programs that are going to be
represented at the fair include the
Rockbridge Area Occupational
Center, Rockbridge County High
School Tutors, the Youth Literacy
Program, First Book, Big Brothers
Big Sisters, Habitat for Human-
ity, the Campus Kitchens Project,
English for Speakers of Other
Languages, General Service, the
Bonner Program, and the Literacy
Campaign. With such a variety of
clubs each student should be able
to ﬁnd a community service activ-
ity that caters to their particular
interests.

In addition to the organizations,
there will also be a performance
by a student band. Food will also

be provided. The Community
Volunteer Fair will serve to show
students the various ways in which
they can get involved around cam-
pus.

“Our goal is to make communi-
ty service accessible and rewarding
for every interested individual and
to spread interest campus-wide,”
said Brooks Vardell, a member of
the Nabors Service League. Ev-
eryone is welcome to attend and
enjoy the day’s celebration of ser-
vice.”

The Nabors Service League
is a student-run community ser-
vice organization containing over
500 students at W  L. They are
dedicated to spreading the spirit of
service throughout campus. The
Community Volunteer Fair is a
great way to show their commit-
ment to the community of W& L.
It also is a great way for possible
new members to ﬁnd a service op-
portunity right for them and join
the mission of helping others.

In addition to the Community
Volunteer Fair, the Nabors Service
League also sponsors other an-
nual events consisting of Dream
a Dream — Read A Book Literacy
Program, Faces of Homelessness
Panel, Midnight Runs, Thanksgiv-
ing Food Drive, Books for Africa
Drive, and Annual Hunger Clean-
up.

The Community Volunteer Fair
is the Nabors Service League’s
ﬁrst event of the year. It is a great
chance for everyone to take part
in their efforts. They put a lot of
work into the event and have im-
proved the fair through their new
ideas. The decision to have a stu-
dent band perform at the fair was
one of these new innovations. Matt
Amling, a Greek Life co-chair,
was able to ﬁnd the band and bring
them to campus for the Commu-
nity Volunteer Fair. The Market-
place has also helped make this
event special. The staff is allowing
to- go boxes in the dining hall so
students will be able to bring their
lunches to Cannan Green where
they can listen to the band and ex-
plore the service opportunities.

n’s soccer conquers rival 

After two losses to Roanoke last year, this year ’s team pulls a 4-1 victory over Maroons on Saturday

By Brooke Sutherland
STA F F W R l T E R

After going 1-1 in preseason
play with a 3-1 victory over
Centre and a 3-1 loss to Transyl-
Vania, the Washington and Lee
women’s soccer team held its
home opener Saturday against
Roanoke.

The game was a tale of rival-
ry and redemption after Roanoke
defeated W&L twice last year.
Roanoke pulled out a 2-1 victory
against W&L in the ﬁnal week of
the regular season and then went
on to defeat the Generals again
in the ODAC semiﬁnals, cutting
short their successful 16-4 sea-
son.
“This rivalry didn’t really ex-

ist for ﬁve or six years,” retum-
ing Generals’ head coach Neil
Cunningham said. “We always
beat them, but then last year they
stole two games from us in one
week. I think it became more
of a rivalry, especially for the
returning players. They felt like
they had a lot to prove.”

The pressure was only in-
tensiﬁed by preseason ODAC
rankings that placed Roanoke
in third, one spot ahead of W&L
in fourth. The rankings turned
out to be nothing more than a
number though as W&L got its
revenge and then some. Battling
through the humid September
heat, the Generals crushed the
Maroons 4-1.

After a shaky start that al-
lowed Roanoke to score within
the ﬁrst 1:30 of play, the Gen-
erals settled down and quickly
took command of the ﬁeld. First
year midﬁelder Allie Espina
from Gaithersburg, Maryland
netted the General’s ﬁrst goal of
the game and her ﬁrst goal of the
season.

“I was really excited,” Espina
said. ‘‘It was deﬁnitely a goal of
mine [to score].”

The Generals quickly fol-
lowed Espina’s goal with anoth-
er from forward Kat Barnes from
Charlotte, North Carolina, mak-
ing the score 2-1. Barnes contin-
ued her scoring streak, opening
the second half with a second

goal. Late in the game, Espina
broke away from the defense for
an open shot to give the Gener-
als their ﬁnal goal. Senior Anne
Van Devender also contributed
two assists to the victory.

Cunningham said he was
very pleased and excited about
his ﬁrst years’ performance.

“They are all going to be very
valuable assets to our team,” he
said.

‘‘I think at one point we had at
least seven of them on the ﬁeld
at the same time which is great.
I think they can really contribute
to our team.”

In addition to the freshmen
scorers, Cunningham also cited
the play of senior Sara Foster-

. Football beats Sewanee

Team rebounds after last weeks loss for a win of 24-1 2 over Sewanee Tigers

By Brlan Devlne
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee
football, one week after
being shut out in their
season opener at Franklin
and Marshall, rebounded
on Saturday with a 24-12
victory over the Sewanee
Tigers. The win should in-
spire conﬁdence in a Gen-
erals team that desperate-
ly needed it, having been
limited to just 51 yards of
total offense against the
Diplomats under the wind

“ and rain of Tropical Storm
‘ - Hanna.

Leading the charge was
senior tailback Stuart Sit-
terson, whose 108 rushing
yards and two touchdowns
were the highlight for the
Generals’ offense. Fresh-
man quarterback Charlie
Westfal was solid in his
ﬁrstcollege start, gaining
92 yards on the ground as
well as throwing for 69.
The Tigers found it diffi-
cult to stop Westfal, who
showed signs of emerging

as a true dual-threat quar-
terback. Last season’s
starter, junior R.J. Vamer,
made only a brief appear-
ance in the second half,
throwing 2 passes for 24
yards after being roughed
up in the season opener at
F&M. Vamer is already
number nine on W&L’s
all-time career passing
yards list, but he may have
to compete for the start-
ers’ job this season, based
on Westfa1’s performance
this weekend. Sophomore
Patrick Rouse, who split
time with Vamer at the
end of last season, also
appeared in the game,
throwing an interception
after victory was assured.
The quarterback situ-
ation aside, the game re-
vealed certain strengths
that the Generals will
rely on the remainder of
the season. With Westfal
and Sitterson in the back-
ﬁeld, the Generals have a
solid running game that
Sewanee’s defense was
largely unable to stop.

By contrast, the Generals’
passing game was mostly
absent from Saturday’s
contest, as W&L never
trailed in the game. West-
fal was 5-for-ll with one
interception, not a bad
total considering last sea-
son’s top receiving threat,
two-time all-conference
selection Jack Martin, has
now graduated. Westfal’s
top target on Saturday
was junior receiver Ryan
Welsh, who caught three
passes for 39 yards.
While the Generals’
offense moved smoothly
upﬁeld, the team’s de-
fense played to its po-
tential. Having lost key
players from the “Blue
Crush” defense of previ-
ous years-‘ all-ODAC per-
formers Bryant Fulk, Kyle,
Luby and Mark Snoddy,
to name just three- the
Generals now rely on one
of the most talented and
experienced defensive
lines in the conference.
Seniors Tommy Matteo
and Scott Russell anchor

a line that held Sewanee’s
ground attack to 137
yards and no touchdowns.
The linebacker corps is
also strong. Juniors Matt
Cassilly and David Love
and senior Brad McAllis-
ter each had six tackles on
the day.

The Tigers, suffering
their ﬁrst loss of the sea-
son, did not have the de-
fensive might to stop the
Generals’ two-pronged
ground game. But their
own offense moved the
ball fairly well, amass-
ing 198 passing yards
and outgaining the Gen-
erals overall. But the Ti-
gers were unable to score
touchdowns when they
needed them most. Quar-
terback Patrick Shelton
threw a score with less
than three minutes re-
maining in the game but
were unable to capitalize
on their next possession.
Given great ﬁeld position
on the W&L 46-yard line
following Rouse’s inter-
ception, the Tigers drove

down the ﬁeld, down by
12 points and needing two
scores, but were stopped
atithe one-yard line on
the last play of the game
when Shelton was tackled
by Russell with one sec-
ond left. Shelton had been
unable to convert on third
and fourth downs once
his team went behind.
Combined with his two
interceptions and three
sacks, this left the Tigers
in a deep hole from which
even their late efforts at
heroics could not recover.

Fresh off this victory,
the Generals now have a
week to prepare for South-
ern Virginia University, in
the opening football game
at the newly renovated
Wilson Field. It will be
the ﬁrst home night game
in program history and
also serves as the annual
Hall of Fame game, where
players of all sports from
W&L’s past are inducted
into the University’s ath-
letic shrine.

and juniors Maggie Sutherland
and Roz Klann at midﬁeld.

“It was just a really good team
performance all around after a
shaky start,” Cunningham said.
“We did a great job of ﬁghting
back.”

That ﬁghting back was vital
for 2007 ODAC Player of the
Year, Van Devender to whom the
victory meant more than just a
win.

“It was really important to
me to win this one, especially
after losing two games back-to-
back to [Roanoke] last year,” she
said.

“It was important to show
them that we are not number

four like the preseason rankings
said. We needed to beat them
and beat them badly to send a
message to the rest of the league
about how we’re going to play
this season.”

“We have such a young, new
team. I am ready for a fresh start
and I think this was the right way
to begin.”

The Generals will next face
off against Ferrum in another
home match on Wednesday, Sep-
tember 17 at 4:30 p.m.

Generals ’volleyball team wins tournament last weekend, scores a win in
straight sets over Randolph and Averett this week, and remains undefeated

By Russ Weems
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee volleyball team improved
its undefeated record this weekend with home wins in
straight sets over Randolph and Averett universities.

Their record improves to 7-0 overall, the Generals’
 best start since they began their season 9-0 in 2003.
5 _ They also improved to 2-0 in the ODAC with their win

over Randolph. This isn’t surprising as the Generals
are looking for their eighth straight ODAC title and
were ranked ﬁrst in the preseason coaches’ poll. The
.. team returned including three All-ODAC First Team
1 selections from last year’s ODAC championship team.
The Generals showed why they haven’t lost a game
2 yet with a dominating effort against ODAC foe over
, 3-7 Randolph. They came out strong in the beginning
2 and _didn’t look back. They didn’t lose a set as they
took the game 25-12, 25-14, 25-10. The team was led
’ by junior outside hitter Rachael Phillips with 11 kills

tributed ﬁve kills. Senior right side Jessica Ulrich also
had a big performance with in four kills and ﬁve digs.
Junior setter Kristi Stevens contributed 16 assists.

The game against 1-9 Averett was not much closer.
The Generals won 25-20, 25-20, 25-12. Phillips, a re-
cent ODAC Volleyball Player of the Week, again put
in a double digit kill performance with 10. This is the
ﬁfth double—digit kill game in the Generals nine games
this year and the 32nd of her career. Jessica Ulrich also
had nine kills in the win. Sophomore middle blocker
Louise Brooks set a career-high with eight kills. Kristi
Stevens again led the team with 27 assists.

The Generals are satisﬁed with their start but are try-
ing to accomplish bigger things for the year. They are
looking for an eighth straight ODAC championship and
also looking to advance deep into the NCAA tourna-
'1 ment. The Generals made it to the Sweet 16 in 2006
and lost in the ﬁrst round last year.

The teamreturns to action on Tuesday as it heads to
Roanoke for an ODAC game at 6:30.

The volleyball team won a tournament at W&L last weekend.
Their current overall record is 7-0, a spectacular start for the
season.
