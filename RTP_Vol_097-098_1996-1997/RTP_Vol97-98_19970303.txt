KEELING SPEAKS ON HEALTH:
Richard P. Keeling, M.D., will visit W&L on Thursday to
Y, address the topic of “Health in Higher Education: Changing

the Campus Climate.” He will give a public address at 4:30
p.m. in Northern Auditorium.

Keeling’s speech will focus on how he believes W&L’s
tradition of honor relates to personal behaviors, values and
a F moral choices outside the academic arena, as well as how the
work of health services supports the academic mission of the
University. He challenges faculty to include health-related
issues such as HIV, alcohol and sexuality in the curriculum.
_ Keeling thinks that students need to look at their behaviors in

making.

Hypnoﬁst

BY Tom WADLOW
PHI ASSITANT News EDITOR

Last Wednesday, not everybody in the Lenfest Cen-
ter was conscious.

Hypnotist Tom Deluca, College Entertainer of the
Year, hypnotized students to pose, dance and do Kung
Fu while the audience rolled on the floor with laughter.

The show consisted of two parts. For the first half,
Deluca impressed everyone with card tricks and guess-
ing words torn out of The Ring-Tum Phi. The second
pan was pure unconscious comedy. Deluca asked for
20 volunteers, put on some soft music and talked to
them. A few finger-snaps later, all were “put under.”

Deluca had people checking their ﬂies whenever he
cleared his throat. He had people taking off their shoes
because they thought they were on the wrong feet. He
had them reverting to childhood and telling him their
favorite TV shows. He had Sophomore Mikel Parker
thinking he wasJackie Chan’sbrother and ﬂyingthrough
the air in impressive Kung Fu kicks.

“I remember saying ‘SnorkeIs,’” said “Jackie’s brother”
Mikel Parker. He says he doesn’t remember much else.

Washington and Lee tax records reveal that
Law School Dean Barry Sullivan is the top-
paid W&L employee, eaming$175,048 in the 1995 tax year.

His compensation is $21,646 more than his supervi-
sor, University President John W. Elrod.

Elrod, who has been employed with the University
since 1984, was Dean ofthe College until July 1, 1995.
When he became president, he received a 13.04% pay
increase, according to data contained in the documents.

The data appeared in the University’s recent [RS 990
Forms, which the IRS requires private institutions of
higher education to complete and make available for
public inspection.

Elrod is not concerned that one of his subordinates
earns more than he does and explained that there is not
as much demand for university presidents in the private
sector as there is for those who are well—versed in the
law. He said Sullivan “took a very large pay cut” to
come to Washington & Lee.

There is no reason why a president’s salary needs to
be the highest in a University,” said Elrod.

“University presidents’ salaries are competitively
determined by salaries in peer institutions. Law and
medical school deans and some senior faculty salaries
are often higher than the president’s salary in the same
institution because of market forces in the practice of
law and medicine in the private sector.”

“Just look at my chest, man!”

Hypnotist Tom Deluca induced students to entertain their peers in the Lenfest

forms reveal employees’ salaries

As students prepare to report their minimum wage
incomes to the IRS, Phi Reporter Aaron Foldenauer
investiages the salaries of W&L’s top-paid employees

listed on the 990,Academe magazine reported in 1995
that the average compensation of undergraduate fac-
ulty at W&L is $75,200.

Elrod said that there are no across-the-board salary

In addition to his salary, the president receives
benefits such a car and a house. According to Elrod, the
Board of Trustees determines the President’s salary,
but the President determines everyone else’s.

So Sullivan’s salary would have been determined by
former President John Wilson, who at the time was
earning more than Sullivan. Sullivan, an expert in
appellate law who has argued several» cases in the US
Supreme Court, has been with the organization since
1994.

As Dean of the Law School, Sullivan teaches two
classes a year and invests much energy into faculty
recruitment, fundraising, career placement, and admis-
sions for the 360-student law school.

Besides Sullican and Elrod, the list oftop saleries is

increases because the process is individualized. Pay
raises, not accounting for promotions, are generally in
the 5% neighborhood, he said.

In addition to the eight employees whose salaries
were disclosed on the 990 form, 164 other W&L
employees earned over $50,000 during tax year 1995,
the period beginning July 1,1995 and ending June 30,
1996.

Elrod believes one of the strengths of W&L is the
quality of its employees, and high saleries are required
to attract top professors and faculty.

“Putting your money into people is a very wise thing
to do,” he said. “W&L is fortunate enough to be well
enough off to pay very competitive salaries to the
faculty, staff, and administration. And that’s some-
thing that the university ought to be proud of.”

Last week, SARAH (Students

delivered the proﬁts of this year’s lip
synch contest to four local food pan-
tries. Thirty four hundred dollars was
raised for the purchase of seven tons
of food, making the 11th annual con-
test the most successful ever.

The United States Department of Ag-
riculture deﬁnes an “average meal” as 1.3
pounds. Thus, SARAH donated 11,278

- meals to the needy of Rockbridge County.

SARAH Advisor Jerry Darrell at-
tributes the success of the event to

spent the past 12 months planning for
it: Richelle Rowe, Nicole Richard,
Dana Hood and Matt O’Brien.

Luckily for children at Central El-
ementary School, some Washington and
Lee University students never outgrew
finger-painting. Local kindergarten and
first graders begin their first art classes
this week, taught by four W&L students:
Brandon Ferguson, Kathryn Sheppard,
James Silberstein and Geoffrey Veale.

Why doesn’t the school have an art
program of its own? Rockbridge County
contracts art teachers from Fine Arts in
Rockbridge, due to the lack of funding
for an art program. However, FAIR only
provides programs for 2nd through 5th
graders. “We look for outside help for

kindergartn

out little ones,” Central Elementary
School Principal Harry Stone said. ‘‘I
was excited when I found out about the
W&L students.”

Senior art major James Silberstein
says that their work is essential. “I don’t
know how you teach kindergarten and
first graders without art,” Silberstein said.
“For many of them, art is the only way
they can express their thoughts and emo-
tions. Art is also critical in developing
their critical thinking and thought pro-
cesses.”

The students will teach art two times
a week for about an hour. “My goals are
to teach them art that will make them
think about what they’re doing and help
discover their individual creativity.”

.;;Fancy Dress dating guide for the hopeless romantics

Last week, I overheard two
freshman guys talking. One asked

 the other. “So, are you like, guar-
LL zinteed an FD date, or is it some-
"3 thing you really have to work on?”
 This amused me, and I probably

GreenLand
Betsy Green ’97

 should have offered it as Quote of

' the Week, but I decided instead to

steal it for use in my column. Any-
way, I think the answer to that
question is that you are pretty much
guaranteed a date for Fancy Dress.
Anyone can get a date iftheir stan-
dards are low enough —— I bet there
are tons of girls at Rockbridge
County High School who’d love to

go. But if you want a quality date,
a fun experience, you do actually
have to put some effort into your
FD date search. Luckily for you,
you have me to help. There are
several kinds of dates available

that’s right for you.
Yourlioyfriend/Girlfriend. lf
you already have a steady boy-
friend or girlfriend, this may seem
to be the natural choice. You are
pretty much guaranteed not to be
rejected, you already know each
other pretty well, and will likely
have a good time. But first, do an
honest evaluation of your relation-
ship. is everything fine, or is there
trouble in paradise? If you broke
up three times last week or if you
just hooked up with his best friend,
cut your losses now and break up.

Fancy Dress is a long weekend of
uncomfortable clothes and social-
izing. it will not save your rela-
tionship.

Your high school are girl-
friend. High school girlfriends
are a common date choice for fresh-
man guys (atleastthose whodidn’t
already break up with their high
school girlfriends at Thanksgiv-
ing). This is a huge mistake. Most
high school girlfriends are pretty
uncomfortable with your drinking
— you’ve no doubt heard about it
already. When she sees the de-
bauchery of FD, she will freak out
and think you are Bailey from Party
of Five. If your relationship isn’t
over already, it will be when she
sees you at a Wednesday night hall
crawl. 'Or worse yet, she will rise
to the occasion and get blitzed on

Zima and you’ll spend the rest of
the weekend watching her get her
sixteen-year-old stomach pumped.

Imports: Cheese. Many W&L
guys will chose to import dates
from one of the Fine Neighboring
Women’s Colleges. There are
some very cool girls just a short
drive away, and you may well have
just as much fun with one of them
as with a W&L woman. Or not.
The key is to get to know this
woman on a deeper level than that
she seemed cute and funinthe dark
basement of your fraternity house.
If you don’t, you’ll end up spend-
ing a lot of time with absolutely
nothing to talk about, time that will
be increased by the fact that she
will probably be sleeping in your
room.

hope some of my professors are

Editor’s note:
“Life on the Hill” will

return next week.

an FD cadet is one of the few
opportunities a W&L woman re-
ally has to actually ask a guy of her
choosing to Fancy Dress. VMI is
full of good looking guys who we
know are in good shape since we
see them running allthe time. And
a man in uniform is certainly ap-
pealing to a lot of women. All you
have to do is decide if a blue-eyed
or green—eyed Keydet would look
best with your dress But remem-
ber, the same advice about women
from other schools applies to ca-
dets, perhaps even more so—these
guys are armed.

Just Good Friends. Probably
the best way to go is to ask a good
friend of yours to go to FD with
you. You have fun hanging out
together anyway —— going to FD
together is the same thing only in

nicer clothes. But don’t take a
Friend Date for granted. Guys,
if you are thinking about that
cool girl who hangs out at the
house a lot, remembfer that some
of your friends might have the
same idea. You better get to
her first. And women, now is
the time to startdropping hints.
Go out, look cute, ad mention
to your buddies that you don’t
have a date yet. Then let nature
do her thing.

So you see, finding a Fancy
Dress date really isn’t that hard.
Go out, look good, smile and
have fun. And if that doesn’t
seem to be working, either
lower your standards or follow
my previous advice and start
hooking up like it’s going out
of style. See you at the ball!

Clinton presents
solution for public
school problems

There is so much truth in the
statement: “A mind is a terrible
thing to waste.” Undoubtedly, all
Washington and Lee students gave
credence to such a belief many
years ago; for ifthey had not, they

From the Left
Laura Knapp ’99

certainly would not be here.

President Bill Clinton has made
education his number one priority
for the next four years, “to ensure
that all Americans have the best
educationinthe world.” Although
his proposals have been charac-
terized as “ambitious” by Repub-
lican skeptics, President Clinton
deserves full support on any and
all measures that seek to improve
the quality of America’s public
schools and make American stu-
dents more competitive for the
21st century.

It is a fact that W&L students
hail from the best elementary edu-
cational systems in the nation. One
need only flip through the Fresh-
man Face book to observe the high
caliber of students that attend this
school. What is common in all
these high schools is quality staffs
and quality facilitieswhich,inturn,
produce quality students.

In his State of the Union ad-
dress, President Clinton proposed
a number of measures that would
make grossly under—funded, un-
der-staffed schools look like the
high schools from which many
Washington and Lee students
graduated.

One of Clinton’s most aspiring
proposals is in regard to making a
college education available to all
American citizens, through the use
of tax breaks and increases in stu-

Quote of the Week

place to hang out when
you’ve got the funk.”

dent loans. “We must make the
13th and 14th years of education,
at least two years of college, just
as universal in America by the
21st century as a high school edu-
cation is today. We must open the
doors of college to all Americans.”
There is a fundamental sense in
this goal.

A W&L student need only to
examine his own career at school.
Many high school graduates in
America today that do not even
consider college or any other form
ofhigher education because ofthe
mere fact that they do not posess
the means to pay for it. In an age
which a college education and in-
creasingly a graduate degree is
essential for success, it is sad that
these students who obviously
worked to their fullest potential in
high school cannot continue with
their studies.

If such a system of denying
students the opportunity to attend
college, what incentive is there
for them to work in high school?
Clinton’s proposal is aimed at giv-
ing these students that incentive.

President Clinton made the as-
tute observation that, “One of the
greatest source of our strength in
the Cold War was a bipartisan
foreign policy. Because our fu-
ture was at stake, politics stopped
at the water’s edge.

Now I ask you, and I ask all our
nation’s governors, I ask parents,
teachers and citizens all across
America, for a new non—partisan
commitment to education, because
education is a critical national se-
curity issue for our future and poli-
tics must stop at the school house.”
This certainly should not be a
Democrat versus Republican is-
sue. Partisanship does not a place
in a discussion about education.

ANSWERING THE ll|JESl|[lN

BY DAVID BALSLEY
PHI FEATURES EDITOR

The announcement that G. Love
& Special Sauce will appear at the
Fancy Dress concert has left at least
some students wondering, “G. who
and Special what?” Unlike the main
act of the evening, A-Tribe Called
Quest, G. Love and Special Sauce
has enjoyed renown only very
recently.

A Tribe Called Quest entered the
mainstream with their 1990 release
“People’s lnstinctive Travels and the
Paths of Rhythm,” whose “Can I Kick
It?” and “I Left My Wallet in El
Segundo” gained popularity. Tribe
did not achieve stardom, however,
until they released “The Low End
Theory” in 1991. “Check the Rime”
and “Scenario,” featured on the al-
bum, both achieved heavy air play
on MTV. Tribe has since enjoyed
success with their two most recent
albums.

In comparison, the popularity of
G. Love & Special Sauce has been
relatively short-lived.

According to the Sony web site
fo'r the group, G. Love (Garrett
Dutton), the band’s vocalist and gui-
tarist, developed an interest in the
guitar as a teenager. Under the in-
fluence Of Bob Dylan and John
Hammond Jr., G. Love also began to
play harmonica on a rack. G. Love
combined his blues with his interest

BY ANDREA EWING
PHI FEATURES EDITOR

Mentoring the future women of
science, and mathematics is a job a
few Washington and Lee: females
have happily assumed.

A new science outreach program
founded by sophomore geology ma-
jor Erin Kraal provides 6th through
8th graders from Maury River Middle
School a chance to conduct experi-
ments with female science majors.

Currently, eighteen gifted and tal-
ented girls participate in the pro-
gram about once a month. Kraal
hopes the group of girls involved
will expand to include all types as
the organization here at W&L be-
comes larger.

“Other departments are starting
to get involved,” Kraal said, “And

needed to be started here at W&.L.

“I want to provide girls an oppor- '

tunity to explore science in a safe
environment,” Kraal said, “We pro-
vide an opportunity for girls to learn
about different areas of science,
math, and technology,”

Kraal taught the first lab focused
on craters. She believes it went well
and hopes to “get girls excited about
science and have it be a part of their
lives.”

Sophomore mathematics major
Rachel Goddu will lead a lab Thurs-

not currently recognized as a club by
the university, works with Elrod as a
volunteer organization.

Future subjects to be covered in-
clude programs on brain teasers and
an analysis of Woods Creek.

In April, Jennifer Mendocha, a
sophomore Biology major, will lead
the program on brain teasers.
Mendocha hopes that the group will
perhaps provide role models and
awaken curiosity in the sciences.

“It would have made a difference
to me to see an interested girl plan-
ning a career in the sciences,”

:

‘E. Wllll?’

The group released its self-titled
debut album in March, 1994. Critics
acclaimed the album’s combination
of blues, “back-porch vocal
stylings,” and semi-acoustic accom-
paniment, which G. Love has termed
“ragmop.” Rolling Stone gave the
album four stars, calling it “the
damnedest thing to hit hip-hop in a
long time.”

Following the release of their al-
bum, G. Love and Special Sauce
began touring clubs and opening for
the Violent Femmes. The group then
played a ten-day tour in the UK,
where they also performed at the
Pink Pop Festival in Holland.

After touring Japan, the group
achieved widespread recognition
when they appeared as a main-stage
act for the 1995 H.O.R.D.E. festi-
val, along with Blues Traveler and
the Black Crows. '-

Building on their newfound suc-
cess, G. Love and Special Sauce has
recently produced their second al-
bum, “Coast to Coast Motel.” The
album has been described as a cross
between folk, blues, jazz, funk,
and rap.

G. Love and Special Sauce will
appear with A Tribe Called Quest on
March 20, at 9:00 p.m., in the
Pavilion.

You may want to see G. Love and
Special Sauce while they are here.
If they achieve the popularity which
some feel they could, you may have
a hard time seeing them again.

'Absolule Power’ shows
Easlwoods sense of 

$‘n’3r*:‘r 1/2
of 4 stars;
funny and
laid-back

The pitch: .
“lt’ll be like '-
‘The Addams
Family’ meets
‘Nixon.”’

BY ALEX CHRISTENSEN
Pm MOVIE CRITIC

Clint Eastwood is one ofthe great American directors. He
likes to get inside of material that is cliched, tired, overused,
orjust bad, and turn it into something solid and entertaining.‘
lt’s not an easy job, but he manages to do it time and time"
again. His “Firefox,” “Heartbreak Ridge,”and “White Hunter,
Black Heart” are all quiet wonders, taking absolutely absurd '
stories and applying such bravura filmmaking and under!’
stated hip self-consciousness that they murder all reasonable
expectations and go for something wholly original. M

“Absolute Power” resembles these films in that the story
is just plain silly. An aging jewel thief (I mean, come on).
named Luther Whitney is in the midst of robbing a large
estate in Washington when he hears someone coming. Hid-'
ing back in the vault where he wasjust grabbing the loot, he;
finds that he is sitting in front of a two-way mirror. On the:
other side, a man and a woman, both apparently drunk, first’
playfully ﬂirt and make out, then start to get rough with
each other. ,

What’s most amazing about this set-up is not that the:
situation is such absurd fun or any kind of building menace,f
but just Eastwood’s use of himself as an actor and an icon to?
subtly mock the whole enterprise. He keeps giving us little}
shots of Luther, the thief, with his hat pulled down over his;
eyes, the lower half of his face stoic or just slightly betrayingl
emotion. lt’s wonderful to watch, like a ballet all on once
man’s face, at the same time sending up every grunting lonei
cowboy Eastwood has ever portrayed, and that’s a lot.E
What’s great is that Eastwood can still use that image to its:
full effect, in “Unforgiven” or “Bridges of Madison County,”3
and then go back and make fun ofit here like he did in “White;
Hunter, Black Heart” and “Heartbreak Ridge.” Being able to
so successfully move back and forth between the image and‘
the self-parody is really quite a remarkable feat, and it can:
only be hoped that Eastwood can keep up the act. _

Anyway, back to the plot: the man who turns out to have’
been the drunk behind the in the bedroom scene turns out, as
you know from the trailers by now, to be the President ofthe:
United States, Alan Richmond (GeIreHackman). When the‘
girl is killed by his Secret Service agents,_a cover-up ensues,

which -Luther immediately involves ‘himself in foiling.

Judy Davis, as the Chiefof Staff, has way too much fun
with her role. Hackman is pretty stalwart and one-
dimensional except for one scene, which makes abso-
lutely no sense to advancing the plot, but is too much
fun to be resisted. Davis enters a party at the White
House wearing a significant necklace, and she and
Hackman do a hilarious dance sequence (to Eastwood’s
own Power Waltz) that brings up images of the best of
Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston from the Addams Fam-
ily films. The absurdity, the ooh-ing crowd, and Hack-
man and Davis’s expressions make it so over-the-top
that you can’t help loving it.

Almost the whole movie is like this. Chase scenes
are perfunctory and seem like they were worked out on
the set. They’re languorous and tense at the same time.-
Luther’s dysfunctional relationship with his daughter
(Laura Linney of “Primal Fear”) is almost played for laughs
as well. We have this sort of superhero thief who dances in
and out of any place he chooses, evading capture and detec-
tion, and then the contrast of trying to relate to his daughter,
whom he largely abandoned after his stints in jail. The
explanation for why they are able to reconcile is so ridiculous
that it’s better to leave it to the movie. It works there; it
wouldn’t work on paper.

Eastwood also keeps including these great shots that
have almost no connection to building the story. lt’s
like he’s saying, “As long as this shot is here, let’sjust
stick it in.” He’s having fun, and there’s nothing wrong
with that. For instance, when Luther first enters his
house, Eastwood shows us a lovely shot of all of the
porches down the block lining up with Luther’s, almost
like a mirror within a mirror. Later, Luther is shown
drawing a sketch of a house, which then fades into the
shot of the actual house. None of these fireworks are
necessary, but they add to this odd sort of dark, relaxed
enjoyment Eastwood creates throughout the film, like
nothing is serious but everything is at the same time.

One thing “Absolute Power” is not is taut. If you’re
looking for a no-brainer thrill ride, this ain’t it, but the
thrills are there and the movie never falters. Eastwood
hasn‘t lost a step as an actor or director.

VMI to learn from other co-ed military schools

BY C.E. MILLER
PHI STAFF WRITER

irginia Military institute is
learning from the
-Citadcl’s mistakes.

Several members of the VMI Co-
education Committee visited Norwich
Univcrsityin Vermontthislastweeks.
The trip allowed committee members
to observe first hand a working co-
educational system.

“We want to do it right,” Second
Class President Kevin Turillo said,
“The best way we can do that is to look
at other military co-educational
schools.”

Norwich is one of two schools that
is participating in a cadet exchange
program with VMl. The exchange

program will help VMl through its
transitional first year ofco-education.
The Citadel is looking to set up a
similar program after two of its four

female cadets withdrew
from the school.
“Visiting other
schools has shown the
necessity of upperclass
female cadets in the
corps,” Tornillo said.
Eight females and
four males will spend a
year at VMI as part of
the exchange program.
The students, from Nor-
wich and Texas A&M

University are familiar with military
co-education. The upperclass female

PRESS RELEASE

Washington and Lee
University students are eli-
gible for up to $100,000 in
scholarship funds , through
Project Vote Smart’s Na-
tional Internship Program.
The funds, which are made
available through grants
from the Hearst Founda-
tion, have been released
by the Project’s founding
board, which includes
former senators Barry
Goldwater, George
McGovern, Mark Hatfield
and Bill Bradley, and other
prominent national lead-
ers.

“These scholarships en-
able Washington and Lee
students to work with in-
terns from colleges across
the country for a semester
or term, to improve the po-
litical climate for every-
one,” saidAnn Yoders, Na-
tional Internship Coordi-
nator. “Armed with the
computers of our Voter’s
Self-Defense System, our
interns fight political hype
every day, by requiring
candidates and elected of-
ficials to be accountable
for their campaign state-
ments and actions while in
office.”

Yoders said that students
from all fields of study are
encouraged to apply for
internships at Project Vote
Smart this year. Their work
at the Project-might focus
on researching hot current

issues, tracking campaign
finance donations, gath-
ering campaign issue po-
sitions or compiling vot-
ing records and perfor-
mance evaluations of can-
didates and elected offi-
cials at the federal and
state levels. Students
serve as researchers on the
Voter’s Research Hotline
(1-800-622-SMART),
and maintain and update
the Vote Smart Web site
(http://www.vote-
smart.org).

“We are very interested -

in diversifying our staff to
reflect information needs
and demands of the
American public,” said
Yoders. “We find it as-
tounding that young citi-
zens are labeled as apa-
thetic and uninterested in
government and politics.
Our interns are the most
idealistic, enthusiastic
group of people in the
country today, and they
constantly inspire the rest
of us to work harder in our
efforts to improve the po-
litical climate for every-
one.”

Project Vote Smart is a
national, non-partisan,
non-profit organization
that is funded entirely
through foundation grants
and the donations of over
50,000 members. Stu-
dents wantin g more infor-
mation about internship
and scholarship opportu-
nities should call Ann

Letters to The Ring-tum Phi

SARAH commended by
Food Pantry

Dear Editor:

I want to thank Students Against
Rockbridge Area Hunger (SA-
RAH), Mr. Gerald Darrell, the stu-
dents of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity, and all those who sup-
ported them, for their very gener-
ous donation to the Natural Bridge/
Glasgow Food Pantry. On Febru-
ary 12, SARAH donated over 4,000
pounds of food to our Food Pantry.
This food will help to feed hun-
dreds of needs people in our com-
munity.

I also want to express my appre-
ciation to those W&Lstudents who
helped transfer all the food to the
waiting trucks They helped move
over four tons of food.

Our Food Pantry serves over

100 families each month. More
than a quarter of the people are
children. One third are elderly
adultsliving on ﬁxed incomes. And
eighty percent of the households
we help are living in poverty. This
food means thousands of dollars in
assistance to these families.

Our Food Pantry is a coopera-
tive ministry of eleven area
churches. It is good to know that
we have groups like SARAH to
support us in our work. SARAH
and the students at Washington
and Lee University are to be com-
mended for their help in fighting
hunger and poverty in Rockbridge
County.

Sincerely,

Edward F. Rigg
Operations Director
Natural Bridge/
Glasgow Food Pantry

Ethnocentrism has no
place at W&L

Dear Editor:

In the spring of 1960, a group of
W&L students were in the locker
room following a track practice.
The conversation turned to the
coming football season and the
comment was made that one of the
schoolsontheschedulemighthave
some black players (Today we
would say African-American, but
that was an earlier time.) One
student put it crudely, “What will
we do if there’s black meat on
Wilson Field?”

The head football coach, Lee
McLaughlin, overheard what was
said and gave the answer: “You'll
act like gentlemen, that’s what
you’ll do.” It was clear what he
meant We would treat all visiting

players alike and none of them
would know there was anything
unusual going on. W&L was all
male and all white in 1960. The
New South was just beginning to
emerge, but the Old South and the
example of Robert E. Lee held us
to the standard of gentlemen.

All ofus can learn from the past.
Some ofus have more tolearn than
others. Unfortunately, there still
are individuals among us who re-
sort to bigotry and racial slurs.
Those of you who told an Asian-
American student this fall that he
doesn’t belong at Washington and
Lee are not gentlemen. It is you
who don’t belong here.

W&L strives to be a
meritocracy. There is no place
here for ethnocentrism.

your own kind beyond a certain time
period."

“FAMILY, MATES, CONNECTIONS."
“rlght, your groundings. your earthly
ties."

“BUT THERE IS MORE?"

yes. you need to integrate your self.
spirituality, body, mind, sou|...these,
surely, you have heard of."

“A NEED FOR SURVlVALl"

“so it seems. but we have too many
desires now. people grow more and
more to hoard possessions. it is in the
cycles before. we always grow to glut-
tony."

“DO YOU BELIEVE IN LIMITS?"

"i believe shelter, food, clothing, love,
friendship, music, family, and opportu-
nity are things we all need, but not as
limits, ratherfoundations, which lead to
the limitless possibilities. the laughter,
the joy and glory found in being. we
don't need closets full of clothes and
wads of money.

“i believe in liming excess. i believe that
limiting yourself to what truly makes you
happy can lead to limitless possibilities
because of that happiness. if you allow
yourself to follow an almost neutral line
through society's web, then you can
escape the materialism, the politics and
the corruption."

"HOW CAN YOU BE NEUTRAL?"
"watch. observe life and create from
what you learn. we have parallel, per-
pendicular and tangent agreeances on
what we see, but it all comes to being
yourvision. your concept or thought or
theory.

"maybe it has nothing to do with neutral-
lty but rather acceptance and anticipa-
tion."

"ACCEPTANCE OF WHAT EX-
ACTLY?"

"differences that exist. to use the cliché;
both sides of the coin. in some cases
though more than one side exists."
‘YES, AND ACCEPTANCE IS EASIER
TO ACHIEVE THAN AGREEMENT ON
CERTAIN THOUGHTS OR DIFFER-
ENCES."

"something like that it seems."
“ANDYOU SPEAKOFANTICIPATION?"
"for when individuality is not curbed. per-
haps for small clusters of people with a
higher intent for living to found their
own."

"THEIR OWN WHAT?"

“creation."
