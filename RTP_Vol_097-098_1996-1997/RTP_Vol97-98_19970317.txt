Circus changes with times

Bg Anne Alvord
Phi Executive Editor

From Pompey’s Rome to today, the
circus is a beloved fonn of family enter-
tainment.

Roman circuses, like those today,
featured both animal and human enter-
tainment. Athletes fought to the death,
or to gain their freedom. Other enter-
tainments in the Roman circus were
chariot races and animal duels.

During the dark ages, circuses as
such died out, but traveling troupes of
entertainers and musicians kept the cir-
cus spirit alive. These traveling enter-
tainers often had animals and acrobats
as part of theirshow, just ascircuses do.

The circus reappeared in Britain. A
British cavalryman, Sergeant-Major
Philip Astley, loved to show off fancy
riding. Hetraveled through thecountry-
side showing his riding, as was the
fashion of the day. While stopping near

London, he roped off a field for his
performance. Soon, Astley perfected a
circusringtoshowoffhisabilitytostand
on the back of a cantering horse. The
riding performance came tobemingled
with clown antics. As time went on,
Astley covered part of his ring with a
roof and added  The modern
circus was born. Ast|ey’s advertising
became more elaborate, and the enter-

tainments of his show grew to include
tumbling, rope-walkingandjuggling. The
Amphitheater Riding School, as it was
called, was famous.
CnarlesHughwcompetedwithAstley.
He not only ran the English Royal Circus,
but trained trick riders. One of his pupils
was John Bill Ricketts, who brought the
circus to the colonies. In the new world,
Ricketts perfonned attheRidingSehoolin
Philadelphia.
Accordingtohistorians,theﬁrstAmeri-
can circus was held in 1793, in Philadel-
phia. It was put on by Ricketts. The show
was wildly successful, even attracting
George Washington in its audience. The
success inspired Ricketts to take the show
on a traveling tour of the U.S.’s major
cities, including Boston, New York and
Charleston. Ricketts constantly sought to
improve his circus. He added clowns,
acrobats and mimes, and in the late 1790s,
he built an amphitheater in Philadelphia to
house the show. The amphitheater was
destroyed by tire, and a discouraged
Ricketts left America to retum to England,
but he and his ship were lost in a storm.
The horse-dominated shows were
largely replaced in the early 19th century
by traveling shows that pitched their tents
on village greens. Lore says that these
circuses were started by “Old Bet”, a Afri-
can Elephant purchased by Hackaliah
Bailey in 1815. Bailey paid a sea captain
$1,000 for Old Bet and was successful

enough showing her to townspeople that
he purchased additional exotic animals
from other ship captains. Bailey traveled
at night to avoid free spectators, and exhib-
ited his animals in barns and other build-
ings. “Uncle Nate” Howes temporarily
took possession of Old Bet and exhibited
her under a round canvas top, the first
record of such a stmeture being part of a
traveling show.

Many others followed Ricketts’ ex-
ample and threw their hats into the circus
ring. The mostfamousofthesewasPhineas
T. Barnum, who would quickly eclipse
Ricketts’ prominence.

P.T. Barnum began as a newspaper
editor. He sold his newspaper, the Herald
of Freedom, in 1834 and moved to New
York with is wife and children.

Barnum purchased an elderly black
woman, Joiee Heth, who claimed to be
George Washington’s nursemaid. He ad-
vertised in local newspapers, and attracted
an audience curious to see the 161-year-
old woman. An autopsy after her death
proved the claim impossible, but Barnum
had already begun his career of making
money by entertaining people.

For over 20()0 years, the circus has
evolved with humanity. From the athletic
contests and chariot races of Rome to the
ﬂaming hoops and clown cars of today's
circuses, the circus continues to rcﬂect the
cultureofthetimewhilemaintainingcom-
mon traditions.

It’s a big job, but somebody has to do it

Melissa Courson, Fancy Dress Committee Chairperson, takes time out from the
planning to talk to the Phi about this year s ball, its planning and her expectations.

Why do you think this
year's theme translates
well for Fancy Dress?

The theme we’ve chosen
is fun and lends itself well
to bright colorful decorations
that stand out, that are recogniz-
able for students to see. I think
the decorations are bright and
attract a lot of attention.

What’s your favorite part
of this year’s ball?

The committee’s creativity
will show in lots of the decora-
tions. Everybody had a chance
to contribute to that.

How much money is be-
ing spent on this year’s
ball?Wheredoesthemoney
come from?

The budget this year is
around $68,000, which is
about normal for FD. We
receive no money from the
EC. We make it all through
ticket and memorabiliasales.

Is there anything differ-
ent or remarkable about this
year’s ball?

I think we’ve created a really
fun and exciting atmosphere.

How many people are
expected to attend?

We usually expect about
1,200 of the student body, but
that’s just undergraduate. lt
doesn’t include faculty or any-
thing either.

‘ Why is the theme kept a
secret?

It helps build suspense and
keeps people interested. When
we do release it, people get ex-
cited and they speculate about
decorations. lt’s a fun tradition
to keep it a secret.

Do you think FD should
be a costume ball?

I think that could be a really
fun idea, but it’s also fun to see

everyone in their formal wear. l
know that’s how it used to be,
and it might be fun to try again
one year.

How was the theme se-
lected?

When we take applications
we ask people to suggest three
themes. We put together a big
list and narrow it down to five,
then discuss the merits of each.
Thenthewholecommitteevotes.

What other themes were
considered?

Other themes we considered
were Mardi Gras, Through the
Decades, The Seven Wonders
of the World, and a Las Vegas/
Monte Carlo/Casino theme.

How are decorations se-
lected and organized?

We brainstorm when the
theme is selected, and we de-
cided we wanted to have more
of an old—fashioned circus than

a modern one.

The committee is broken
down into areas, and they de-
cide and finalize the details of
each area.

Will there be entertain-
ers or live animals this
year?

Therewillbeentertainers,but
no live animals.

What’sthehardestthing
aboutbeing FD chair? Will
being chair impede your
good time on the night of
the ball?

The hardest thing is keep- g

ing on top of every thing -
decorations, invitations,
memorabilia, the playbill..
There’s just so much plan-
ning that goes into the ball.

l’m excited to see all the
committcc’s work come to-
gether.

Do you have any goals

for this year’s FD? What
part of FD are you looking
forward to most?

ljust want everybody to have
agood time and be safe. l’m
most looking forward to see-
ing everybody have fun.

How did you decide you
wanted to be FD chair?
How were you selected?

I was on the steering com-
mittee since my freshman
year, and I decided I wanted
to be a part of planning it. l
interviewed with EC last
spring.

When do you start plan-
ning the ball?

We start planning in early
October. That’s when the com-
mittcc is chosen.

How many committee
members are there?

We have 48 people on the
committee.

G-Love and Speei

m miss-:'au  sane: swam

merges musical styles

Bg Darceg Livingston
Phi Staff Writer

You may have spied them on Country
Music Television. Or on one of the side
stages during the 1995 H.O.R.D.E. festi-
val. You may have even seen G. Love
performing in Europe with last year's
Fancy Dress act-Coolio.

lf there was only one word to describe
the sound of G. Love and Special Sauce,
it would have to be eclectic.

The Times-Picayune described G.
l.oveas“a youngwhitehipsterimmersed
in black musical styles. Love doses his
music with hip-hop attitude, but is also a
disciple of old-school New Orleans
R&B.”

Also evident in the sound of G. Love
are his early influences of the Beastie
Boys, Run-DMC and blues guitarisat and
hamionica player John Hammond.

G. Love (a.k.a. Garrett Dutton) calls
his group’s music “ragmop.” He told
TheDenverPost, “I don’t think it’s blues
in the traditional sense. lt’s our own
form.”

The group has gone through some
personnel changes, but now consists of
the original drummer, Jeff Clemens, and
bassist King Kane. G. Love plays the
guitar, harmonica, and Dobro (the “rack”)
in addition to doing the vocals.

G. Love and Special Sauce have re-
leased two albums: a self-titled debut in

1994, and their follow-up titled, Coast to
Coast Motel in 1995. A third album is
now in the works in Philadelphia, and
The Orlando Sentinel reported that it
will feature a guest appearance by G.
Love’s greatest influence——John
Hammond.

In addition to playing with Special
Sauce, G. Love has a number of other
bands on the side.

One is called King’s Court, which has
more of a country feel. But, as G. Love
told the Sentinel, it is not country music
in the traditional sense.

“The country rceord’s cool,” said G.
Love. “lt has the instrumentation of a
country band, but it‘s definitely G. Love
singing country music; I’m rapping over
the country stuff halfthc time.”

Another one of his side projects is a
band called All Fellows. G. Love de-
scribed the band’s music to the Sentinel
as “Philidclphonic street-style blues, doo-
wop, hip-hop, in a way. l’m really excited
aboutthat. Drums, bass, pcrcussion,guitar,
andweallsing. lt’sactually prcttymuchall
dudes l’vc known my whole life, dudes 1
went to high school with.”

G. Love and special Sauce are hot on
stage, and their music ~ although practi-
callyindescribablcAisthctypcthat makes
everyone get up and dance. The Pavilion is
definitely the place to be this Thursday,
March 20 at 9 p.m. when G. Love and
SpecialSauceopen-upforATribc Called

Kings of Swing‘, Tyrone
Smith Revue promise to
keep ban guests dandng

The Kings of Swing have been
playingelassical swing and te best
of Beach, Motown and rock and
roll for over 20 years and still have
people of all ages crowding dance
floors up and down the east coast.

From a festive open-air concert
to the most ultra-formal black tie
affair, the Kings of Swing have
enthusiasm and showmanship that
are sure to please.

The exciting sound of the Kings
of swing is being heard on cam-
puses of major colleges and uni-
vcrsities, at wedding receptions
and retirement parties, and before
elite audiences at major socail and
special events.

ln addition to playing several
college events, the Kings ofSwing
have appeared at the 1982 Inaugu-
ral Ball of Governor Charles S.
Robb and the 1989 Inaugural Ball
of President George Bush.

The 14-piece band originated
12 years ago when the members
were students at the University of
Richmond. Playing such favorites
as Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman,
Count Basic and Woody Herman,

the Kings of Swing appeal to all
audiences and are sure to delight
their audience in the Big Gym Fri-
day night.

While the Kings of Swing play
in the Big Gym, a band of an en-
tirely different nature, the Tyrone
Smith Revue, will be playing in
the Small Gym.

What separates the Tyrone
Smith revue from other great dance
bands in the Louisville area? Au-
dience participation.

Who wouldn’t what tojump up
on stage with a 5’7” black man
who wears a superman outfit?
Surely not the guests at FD. Tyrone
Smith and his wacky cohorts may
well be the biggest clowns of all
under W&L’s Big Top.

‘Smith originated the Revue
when he was in college. Origi-
nally called Tyrone Smith and the
lnvaders, the Revue has been im-
pressing audiences all across the
Southeast. From clubs in Mem-
phis and Atlanta to formal events
in Richmond and Charleston, the
Revue promises to get everyone

hopping.

H all ebe fails, steal someone else’s date

"6-Love and
Tabasco Sauce‘ Mctvtanernin.

Well, Fancy Dress time is here,
which means one thing — lots of
boring campus columnists are going
to be yapping on about what to wear,
whom to take, etc. Well, not this
boring campus columnist. No, sir,
this talentless hack is going to be
telling you all about another fun FD
activity —- stealing your friends’
dates.

Allow me to set up the situation.
You’ve decided to go with a “friend”
(in other words, the Pope has a better
chance of getting some this weekend), or
worse. You may have relied on a random
hook-up, or agreed to go with someone
you’ve never met, but your friends say
“has a nice personality”.

Now, remember, saying someone “has
a nice personality” is like saying that
they're “well spoken”. In other words,
you can’t think of a single real com-
pliment to give.

So you end up going with Bertha,
the 300 pound Nazi lesbian biker
chick. Or, for women, you end up
with Dementia, the pale, 95-pound
Marylin Manson fanatic who’s certain
he's a vampire.

Despite your date’s nice personality,
you’re not having a good time. How can

you salvage this weekend?

All you have to do is steal the attrac-
tive dates your socially superior dates
have snagged.

Butstealing, you say, isn’tthatagainst
the Honor System? Well, yes, but no.
You see, ifyou read the bylaws carefully,
you’ll find that the Honor System is
suspended during FD weekend. This law
is meant to protect guys who might like
to say “l’ll love you forever” or “Of
course l’ll call” without worrying about
being booted out of school for lying.

(Note — If you actually read the by-
laws, you'll ﬁnd that [just made all this
up. Now don't you feel like a dork for
reading the bylaws?)

The easiest way to steal a date is to get
your friend nice and drunk, passed out,
covered in his own vomit, lying fetal
position in the corner. Then simply move
in on the lonely date.

Ofcourse, your friend might be one of
those people who can handle large
amounts ofalcohol without showing any
signs ofdrunkcnness (slurring ofspcech,
troublewalking, voting democratic,ctc.),
In this case, more tact is needed. Try
casually addressing one of the following
phrases to your friend when his date is
within earshot:

' “Pick up the phone, it’s your
parole officer.”

' “Pick up the phone, it’s the VD
clinic.”

by university librarian

By Anne Alvord
Phi Executive Editor

n 1907, Annie Jo

Robertson White and a

handful of Washington
and Lee students created the first
Fancy Dress Ball. The theme was
Bal Masque.

Admission to this ﬁrst ball was
free, and costumes cost about
$2.00. The ball was created with
$44, funck leﬁ over from theatre
production proceeds. Music was
provided by an orchestra from
Virginia Military Institute, who
were known for their knowledge
of the latest two-steps of the day.

When White and her students
ﬁr! organized the ball, it was met
with indifference by students, but
opinions quickly changed.

White, called “MissAnnie” by
students, was the university li-
brarian at thetime. She was dearly
loved by the university commu-
nity. One crew boat in the 18905
was named Annie Jo alter the
energetic librarian.

White had a run-in with the
law during Prohibition, when she

purchased bottles of rum and
scotch through the mail. Univer-
sity President Henry L. Smith in-
tervened, preventing a grand jury
indictment.

The Calyx wrote of White in
1908, “Admiration of her is
stamped forever on our minds;
love for her is seated deep in our
hearts; respect for her is impressed
indelibly on our souls.”

In the 19305, White was fea-
tured in Life magazine for her
accomplishments.

White has not only been im-
mortalized in the continuing tra-
dition of Fancy Dress, but also in
Leybum Library's computerized
catalog. The name “Annie” was
chosen because it is short, easy to
pronounce and spell, and has sig-
niﬁcant W&L connections, Uni-
versity Librarian told a Phi re-
porter researching White in 1994.

White was appointed Univer-
sity Librarian in l895. She retired
in 1928 and died in 1938. She
attended every Fancy Dress ex-
cept one from 1 907 until her death.

Research from 1992 and 1994
Fancy Dress Supplements con-
tributed ro this article.

Circus workers typically work every day for months on end, often as much as 11
months a year with only a few weeks off around Christmas, during which the new year's

edition is organized.

Constantly moving from one town to another, the members of a circus form a very
tightly knit family. Holidays are celebrated enmassi and weddings are often celebrated
in the center ring. The community tends to be extremely liberal and tolererrt of diversity
within its ranks, but wary of outsiders.

Because of the long tradition of the circus. and its isolation fromthe outside, the circus
has largely developed a culture of its own. with its own jargon and traditions.
