Students voice opinions on gays

G&L President Christensen debates
critic Miller on role of organization

BY AARON FOLDENAUER
PHI STAFF WRITER

Glenn Miller consistently attacked
Alex Christensen’s Gay and Lesbian or-
ganization. Christensen had enough.

Openly gay Christensen, founder of
the privately funded G&L, refused to sit
on his hands. He called Miller out—to a
one-on-one public debate, held last
Wednesday in the Northern Auditorium.

Anti-gay signs such as “Cheer for the
Queer! Go Alex!” were posted around
campus the day of the debate.

The auditorium was packed, with
people standing along the walls and sit-
ting in the ailses. Christensen came out
swinging at Miller.

“We don’t practice promiscuity at our

  

secret meetings. We don’t endorse weird
sex. We don’t do any ofthis crap that you
said we do! This stuff is crap! lt’s
disgusting! It’s shameful!”

Christensen’s recurring question to
Miller was, “Why do you insist in being
funny about me?”

Miller responded that he said what he
did for entertainment purposes and it was
“so out there, so ridiculous, that nobody
could possibly take it seriously.”

“Believeitor notAlex,”Miller added,
“most people on campus truly cannot and
do not take your group seriously.”

As for the role G&L should play on
campus, Miller called most ofwhat G&L
does “praiseworthy.”

But, according to Miller, G&L could

eoffrey Brian Baker, a 22-year-old Washing-

ton and Lee University law student, was stab-

bed and robbed of $40 at his 20 Fuller St.
apartment Monday around 9:30 p.m.

Based on Baker’s description, police arrested a 17-
year-old male on Morris Street around 10 p.m. The
juvenile was charged with robbery and malicious wound-
ing. He is being held in the Staunton Detention Home.

The robbery may be linked to a break-in at Baker’s
apartment during the Christmas holiday.

“They just messed up the door,” Baker said. “Be-
cause of the area I live in, my valuables were stored
away at a friend’s apartment. I thought it was an
isolated incident and because I was a student away for
break.”

At around 9:30 p.m. Monday night, while Baker was
studying in his apartment, a teenager came to his door
stating that he had information about the break-in. “He
asked me if there was a reward,” Baker said. “I said that
if he gave me any information that leads to this guy’s
arrest, I would give him 50 bucks.

“He said the guy’s name was William Smith and that
he was a white drug dealer from Roanoke. I didn’t give
him any money, and he left right after that. I thought it
was kind of odd, but I wasn’t that worried.”

About 10 minutes later, the same boy came to the
door again, this time with a friend. “They just walked
into the house uninvited and said they had the guy’s

“I felt something strike me on the back of my neck
and I thought he was hitting me. I turned and saw him
standing there with a knife. Then I realized that he had
stabbed me.”

The attacker stabbed Baker a few more times in the
face and arm, stopping only when the knife broke.
Pummeling Baker with his fists, the attacker demanded
that Baker hand over his money.

At some point, the teen stopped the attack and
allowed Baker to lead him to the bedroom where he
gave the boy the $40 out of his wallet.

“Then he said to me ‘Now I’m going to take you to
the police station for what you did.’ I told him that I’d
be happy to go to the police station,” Brian said.

After the attacker allowed Baker to put on his shoes
in the living room, Baker, noticing that the door was
wide open, escaped from the attacker. He ran about 100
yards to the police station.

Baker had three stitches in the back of his neck and
was treated for cuts on his face and arm at Stonewall
Jackson Hospital.

There was no other apparent motivation for the
attack other than the money, Baker says. “I had never
seen him before in my life and I hope I never see him
again.”

According to Baker, the person who accompanied
the attacker witnessed the events but did not participate.
Police have not made a second arrest.

to review options

 

BY KATHRYN MAYURNIK
PHI STAFF WRITER

The mad rush for Physical Education
registration earlier this month was an-
other reminder of Washington and Lee’s
somewhat archaic registration method.
W&L has made preliminary steps to

modernize the registration process to
either voice mail or Internet, but the high
cost of the project pushes the switch to at
least the fall term of 1998. The move
towards a computerized system raises
questions about changing tradition and a
possible loss of personal attention at
W&L.

The Committee on Registration and
Class Schedules was expanded last fall
to discuss new options; their analysis
leaned toward Internet registration rather
than voice mail. The cost to install voice

response technology, without consider-
ing thecost of personnel, is about $35,000,
University Registrar Scott Dittman said.
Dittman stated that the busy signal on the
phone may be as inconvenient as waiting
out in the cold.

“A web interface would be more ac-
cessible to students since most have ac-
cess to a computer or have one of their
own,” Dittman said.

However, W&Ldoesn’t employ any-
one with the ability to perform the pro-
grammingrequired,Dittman says. “There

Smith nominated for Pulitzer

BY TARAH GRANT
PHI NEws EDITOR

Rodney Smith, editor of “Shenandoah,” has been
nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for a distinguished vol-
ume of original verse for his work “Trespasser.”

“Trespasser” is a collection of 37 poems published
last summer. Ireland’s wild landscapes, pub music and
long conversations with its people inspired most of the
poems, said Smith. Louisiana State University, who
nominated the work for an award, describes Smith’s
poems as “knotty and precise, blazing into moments of
recognition with the elliptical testimony and spare light
of everyday of everyday objects.”

Smith received his bachelor’s degree in philosophy
from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

and a master’s degree in English from Appalachian
State University. He served as a writer-in-residence at
Auburn University for 19 years before becoming the
editor of “Shenandoah, The Washington and Lee Uni-
versity Review” in July 1995. In addition to “Tres-
passer,” Smith has written six other collections of
poetry and onecollection ofshortstories. His numerous
honors include the Emily Dickinson Prize and the John
Masefield Poetry Prize.

Smith considers “Trespasser” his most important
work. “‘Trespasser’ may manage to address themes of
great personal, even private, importance, while contain-
ing them in vessels that are less personal,” he said. “I
hope I’ve found a way to explore language, self and
something in the wider culture all at once, a task all

    

is also a security issue involved. There’s
a difference between looking up infor-
mation on the Internet and an interac-
tively changing site.”

The cost of a web interface ranges
anywhere between $35,000-$50,000,
depending on the amount of personnel.

“It is basically money driven at this
point. lfwe get funding at the end ofthis
year, the earliest possible time for the
change would be the 1998 fall term. But,

OPINION

JANUARY 20, 1997

Clinton should focus on race relations problem

During the Inauguration today, Will-
iam Jefferson Clinton will again officially
assume the duties and obligations of the
office of the Presidency. It is from this
point on, as Arthur Schlesinger Jr. states,
that Bill Clinton “faces his rendezvous
with history.” Unable to run for office

From the Left

again, Clinton must “make his mark be-
tween now and January 19, 2001.” With
his first term riddled with inconsistencies
and lack of strong leadership, Clinton now
has four years to turn the tide.
Schlesinger believes that “Clinton’s
second term offers at once the potential of
greatness and the potential of humilia-
tion.” In an article entitled, “The Ultimate
Approval Rating,” Schlesinger updates
his father’s earlier ranking of Presidents,.

As an introduction to the study of the
presidency, Professor Strong assigned this
reading and polled the members of my
Politics 335 class as to their opinions re-
garding who were indeed the best presi-
dents.

The findings of this informal poll only
mildly surprised me, give the political
climate of the W&L student community.
But at the same time, one particular re-
sponse galvanized my opinion that
Clinton’s ultimate goal should and must
be to solve the problem of race relations. It
is abundantly obvious that this is the most
important and consequential issue for the
future of America,

Forthe most part, the standard responses
for the best president poll were Ronald
Reagan, George Washington and Franklin
Roosevelt. However, it was one of the
answers for the worst president and Pro-
fessor Strong’s subsequent recount of a
similar occurrence that inflamed me to
devote an entire column to this subject.

While a large majority of students listed
Abraham Lincoln as one of the best presi-
dents, one anonymous student listed him
as the worst. Too much of a coward, in the

“What the
United States is
witnessing is a

ration in the
area of race
relations. ”

not-so-grand tradition of racists, to speak
up and attempt to intellectually defend his
position, I can only assume what he meant

when he put Abraham Lincoln in the same
category as Buchanan, Hoover and Nixon.

Is it as disturbing to you as to me that
someone actually believes that Lincoln is
the worst president because of his brave
and decisive action regarding the freedom
of slaves during the Civil War? Does
anyone actually believe that the United
States would be a better place had that
never occurred? Lamentably, I guess the
answer to the latter question is yes.

What the United States is witnessing is

a general deterioration in the area of race
relations. Examine the huge split between
whites and African-Americans regarding
the outcome of the OJ. Simpson trial.
Remember the riots that occurred in Los
Angeles not so long ago. Consider what
the implicationsof the end of Affirmative
Action.

It is obvious that this has become a clear
and present danger for the USnited States.
If attitudes like the student’s in my class
persist and multiply, what can we say

about our future? We are all at a critical
juncture; what we need is strong leader-
ship and President Clinton to set clear
goals in order to stem the growing discon-
tent felt by both sides of this issue.

In all honesty though, it is not at all
important to pursue a course of action
with the mere purpose to curry favor
with historians in order to secure a
favorable position in the history
books. Essentially, Bill Clinton just
needs to do the right thing.

Finally, I would just like to make
one statement: Just because this col-
umn is written under the title “From
the Left” does not mean that this is
exclusively a liberal viewpoint. Al-
though my naiveté might be overcom-
ing me again, I believe that both con-
servatives and liberals have similar
sentiments regarding the need for ac-
tion in this area. Where conserva-
tivcs and liberals divide is over how
such action should be taken.

Networks have recently agreed
to implement a voluntary rating
system to help parents make in-
formed decisions about what shows
their children should be watching.

Gr.eenLand
Betsy Green ’97

Like “Muppets Tonight” okay,
“Melrose Place” maybe not. Per-
sonally, I think it’s a good idea.
Television includes more sex and
violence than ever before. Is it
really appropriate for an eleven
year-old to hear on “Friends” that
Ross fantasizes about Princess Leia
in her gold bikini? And “The X-

Tvrating system not fair to

can’t imagine the effect it has on a
little kid.

But the new rating system only
helps children. What about us
adults? Maybe we like sex and
violence but would like to be
warned about otherthings we might
find offensive? I propose a new,
expanded rating system.

My first change would have to
do with those trashy made-for-TV
movies which often feature Tori
Spelling. They all have vague,
shocking titles like, “Betrayed by
Love,” “Our Mother’s Secret,” or
“No One Would Tell.” I think the

Alex:

The words get

I want a brawl.

The students stuffed into North-
ern Auditorium Wednesday night
were expecting fireworks, or at
least a few sparks to ﬂy between
Alex Chistensen and Glen Miller.
The war of words was getting its
voice.

Life on the Hill
C. E. Miller ’98

Christensen and Miller have
spent the past few months sparring
in The Trident. For those of you
who have failed to notice this, Miller
writes a satirical column that often
pokes fun at the gay, lesbian, and
bisexual organization commonly
known as G&L. Christensen is the
Chairperson of G&L and the only
student member out of the closet.

The debate was suppose to be
about the role of G&L on our cam-
pus. People were expecting accu-
sations, fist fights and perhaps a
riot between the leftist “commies”
thatare secretlyinfiltratingourcam-
pus, and the “good ’ole southern
boys” who still believe the confed-
eracy exists. I suppose that is the
only explication for the number of
people crammed into Northern Au-
ditorium.

The inherent conﬂict between
the two was summed up in the
opening statements: “I’m gay,”
Christensen said. “I’m not gay,”
Miller said, Amy Gorham, Execu-
tive committee Vice President
served as the impartial moderator.
Both Miller and Christensen agreed
to adhere to a reasonable standard
of gentlemanly behavior. The
crowd laughed. I suppose that is
because throughout the exchange
of letters, and Miller’s column there
has been no respect for each other
or the position each takes.

Christensen complained that
Miller had taken his jesting too far.
“I have no problem with humor,”
he said, “I have a problem with
rude, mean, perpetual stupidity.”
This summed up the core of Alex’s
debate: He claims that there are
other things to ridicule on a weekly
basis besides G&L.

Miller’s opening statement was
formal and longer than the allotted
eight minutes. He was prepared,
reading from his notes, citing love
of Washington and Lee and conser-
vative values as his basis of objec-

tion to G&L, “It is the ﬂagship for
all other liberal politically correct
movements,” he said, of G&L.

Twelve minutes into the debate
and no fist ﬁghts. The crowd was
crammed against the walls. Here
and there cameras ﬂashed and
rolled recording the Miller v.
Christensen debate for posterity.

Miller talked of integrating ho-
mosexual students and looking for
hidden designs within G&L’s
agenda. He asked Christensen to
explain why they focused on ac-
ceptance and not integration. He
felt that Christensen was a rather
unobtrusive leader for the organi-
zation, but that in a few years a
new leader could take a more radi-
cal approach and demand repre-
sentation in many student organi-
zations. When accused of wild
paranoia, he agreed.

“I have basis for my paranoia,”
he said, “There are many other
liberal arts colleges that are no
longer what they were because of
political correctness.”

“I am a conservative Republi-
can,” Christensen said, “I don’t
want to change W&L.” While
Miller seemed ready to debate the
topic at hand, the role of G&L at
W&L, Christensen seemed more
concerned about getting Miller to
stop publishing satire of G&L
week after week.

“The back page of The Trident
is funny,” Miller said. “That is
why I write it: People laugh. You
should learn to laugh.”

Miller declined to ask his last
question and both declined clos-
ing remarks. Gorham dismissed
the crowd at 8:25 p.m. The war of
words was just talk. People cleared
out a little disappointed, hanging
around the lobby to talk about
what they felt wasn’t discussed in
the debate. Casual observances
were made as to whether Miller
will stop ridiculing G&L. It

seemed to be a split crowd, many A

coming down hard on Christensen
saying he chose this school and he
should deal with the conse-
quences. Others took
Christensen’s point of view, want-
ing more tolerance on the cam-
pus.
There wasn’t even a brawl.

SOC ITT iO|2 Till <ﬁl2lS DISD ﬂTS STUDENT lﬁ fill

BY DAVID BALSLEY
PHI FEATURES EDITOR

Visitors of the Alumni House
last Thursday discovered a
rather unusual art exhibition.

Instead of caviar and cham-
pagne, visitors were served pigs-
in-a—blanket and plastic cups
filled with applejuice. Some of
the artwork on display also
served as the evening’s furni-
ture. The student artists onhand
had dressed in their most ex-
travagant attire, in mimicry of
sophisticates who frequent less
light-hearted art openings.

The event was the Faux So-
phisticate, sponsored by the So-
ciety for the Arts, which show-
cased the talent of fourteen stu-
dent artists. Sarah Anne Ryder,
a self-described “jack-of-all-
trades” and member of the SFA,
characterized the evening as
“a half-serious show of
serious work.”

“It was half-serious, not
half-assed,” added Robert
McKinnon, the Chair of

the SFA.

The Society for the Arts is a
student organization which
fosters the appreciation of
artistic ability at Washington
and Lee University.

“We facilitate the apprecia-
tion of the talent present on
campus. We show that to the
community, faculty, and other
students. It is this talent which
provides richness and variety
to Washington and Lee,”
stated Ryder.

According to McKinnon, the
SFA achieves this goal by pro-
viding a venue for the exhibi-
tion of students’ artistic talents
as well as a forum for open
discussion of pertinent topics.

“People either don’t care, or
don’t understand, or don’t have
the time to see what everyone
else is doing,” McKinnon

stated. “There seem to be dot- _

ted lines around all the depart-
ments. A lot of the people on
campus don’t experience ev-
erything that they can in four
years. We like to encourage
experience.”

The SFA hosts various exhi-
bitions of different kinds
throughout the year, including
poetry readings, concerts, and
art shows such as the Faux
Sophisticate.

Both McKinnon and Ryder
are pleased with the success of
last Thursday evening.

“By and large it was the most
social event we’ve ever hosted:
not only was people’s attention
on the art, but also on one
another,” McKinnon stated.

“A couple of faculty came,”
McKinnon continued. “We’re
glad to see that we have support
from the community. It was
also good to see some local art-
ists there for us.”

The Society for the Arts will
host a musical performance by
The Big Cats on Wednesday,
January 22, at 8:00 p.m. in the
GHQ. Admission to the con-
cert is free.

Also, the SFA will meet on
Thursday, January 23, in duPont
109 at 7:00 p.m. Coffee will be
served. Everyone is welcome
to attend.

Awards are presented not only to

papers in large cities and national
magazines. In fact, the Norfolk Vir-
ginian-Pilot received the Angus
McDougall Editing Award, the
highest award in this competion,
given to a newspaper in recognition
of outstanding photography editing.

There are many remarkable pho-
tographs every year, but few capture
the attention of a nation. These pic-
tures have done just that.

tions many times missed in the
neutral wording of a news story.

Founder Cliff Edom’s philoso-
phy to “tell the truth with the cam-
era” has been adopted by many
photojournalists, and it holds as
the philosophical foundation for
the competition.

The “Pictures of the Year” ex-
hibit is the largest photojournalism
contest in the world. Edom began
this competition to stimulate excel-
lence in photojournalism. He ac-
complished his goal and much more.

“Ghosts of Mississippi”:
A line, incomplete effort

~A'*~A'1/2 of

4 stars;

a bit
off-balance
The pitch:
“lt’lI be like
‘JFK’ in
Mississippi.”

BY ALEX CHRISTENSEN
PHI MovIE CRITIC

There’s a reason that Oliver Stone’s “JFK’ doesn’t
delve too deeply into the life and political career of
John F. Kennedy: the whole country is steeped in it.
President Kennedy’s death left a deep psychic wound
which resulted in a fascination with his life, death, and
descendants, probably unprecedented in American his-
tory. Only Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr. come
close. Maybe Elvis.

JFK’s story is more mysterious, though. It’s never
been close to solved. There’s one other reason: Stone
has wacky theories about what JFK was about to do in
Vietnam, which history does not endorse, so indulging
them too closely in the film would strain credibility
even farther than he already does. Still, he includes
speeches by Eisenhower and Kennedy and other foot-
age which paint just enough of the background to tell
his compelling if flawed story more than effectively.

Unfortunately, Rob Reiner, who is working in
“Ghosts of Mississippi” with the story of a generally
much lesser known public figure, Medgar Evers, doesn’t
realize how much of Evers’s story is needed to tell the
story he is telling, about the trial(s) and ultimate con-
viction of Evers’s assassin, Byron de la Beckwith.

How can an audience be expected to be left with the
full measure ofthe tragedy of his death and the triumph
of bringing Beckwith to justice without that knowl-
edge? I’m not suggesting that Reiner had to tell Evers’s
story (definitely worth telling in a movie with as big a
budget and cast) instead of the trials of Beckwith, just
that the story of Beckwith is incomplete without more
about Evers.

What Reiner does do is tell a story which is indeed
fascinating and important. Alec Baldwin, wrongly over-
looked as an actor recently, did great work this year in
Phil Joanou’s also overlooked “Heaven’s Prisoners,”
and he does it again in “Ghosts of Mississippi.” Baldwin
portrays Bobby DeLaughter,_the prosecuting attorney

. who finally lit a fir.e unde.r. th?§’Evers..da‘sé after thirty 

years (after Myrlie Evers, his widow, portrayed by
Whoopi Goldberg, lit a fire under him).

Baldwin, working with a familiar cliché, the white
lawyer-hero correcting injustice, manages to bring a
dignity and respect to the role largely missing in Kevin
Costner’s Jim Garrison, Matthew McConaughey’s Jake
Brigance, and Chris O’Donnell’s Adam Hall. This is
really quite a task. Gregory Peck did it. It is accom-
plished also through the use of the characters of
DeLaughter’s children, who function as a sort cf Greek
chorus, constantly questioning why DeLaughter is do-
ing this or that, how they should respond, and what
they should know about the history of the place in
which they live.

Indeed, while done well, this accomplishment dis-
turbingly unbalances the structure of the film. When
DeLaughter identifies with Medgar Evers, which he
certainly needs to do, it manipulates the audience into
transferring moral authority to DeLaughter, who doesn’t
really earn it the way Evers did, from the memory of
Evers himself. This could have been avoided not by
changing the development of Baldwin’s character, but
by giving us more of Evers, so that instead of this
psychic transference, DeLaughter’s actions and deci-
sions would become echoes and tributes rather
than substitutes.

As it is, the movie still works, but it’s too easy. John
Sayles’s Lone Star of last year comes closest to this
kind of storytelling, allowing the past and present to
coexist and comment on each other without either side
“winning.” In “Ghosts of Mississippi,” the present
wins for being more morally up-to-date, but it does a
disservice, if slight, to Evers’s memory.

Still, the production is first-class all the way, with
solid, creditable performances by Baldwin, Goldberg,
and the shockingly evil Byron de la Beckwith created
by James Woods. Medgar Evers’s son Darrell plays
himself and Martin Luther King, Jr.’s daughter Yolanda
plays Medgar Evers’s daughter Reena.

Charles Evers (Bill Cobbs in the film), Medgar
Evers’s brother, also gets a slight. In real life, Charles
Evers took over from Medgar Evers as NAACP field
secretary after his death (which is briefly mentioned),
but also continued the political fight by becoming the
first black mayor ofa bi—racial Mississippi town in 100
years when he became mayor of Fayette and ran for
governor and senator from Mississippi unsuccessfully.
In the film, he is portrayed as a radio station owner
who, by implication, has probably been withdrawn and
contemplative since his brother was killed. In reality,
he stirred things up his whole life, becoming friends
with George Wallace, David Duke, and Ronald Reagan,
and bucking the black establishment by becoming a
Republican. Charles Evers is not the retiring, sit-back
figure portrayed in the film.

Winter rush
a success

BY ERICA PROSSER
PHI STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee’s first-ever
men’s Winter Rush has drawn to a
close, and the time has come to deter-
mine the success of this year of changes.

According to Associate Dean of
Students Leroy “Buddy” Atkins aver-
age freshmen male GPA this fall term
was 2.799, a number that Dean of
Students Dennis Manning says is per-
haps as much as one-tenth of a point
higher than previous years. Dean
Atkins also reports that the average
GPA of the fraternities this fall term
was 3.026, a rise from previous fall
terms. Dean Manning attributes this
fall’s rise in GPA to the later rush.

These promising numbers lead

ManningtoaffirmthatthewinterRush
schedule will be pursued in future
years.
Manningbelievesthatsororitieshad
an excellent rush as well, and adds that
Kappa Delta, the new sorority, is “off
to a good start.”
, “This rush was an extraordinary
success, and I attribute that success to
the excellent leadership of Anthony
Mazzarelli, Sara Benson, and Dean
Atkins,” Manning continued. “The
University is very fortunate to have
these people.” Mazzarelli is the presi-
dent of the Interfraternity Council, and
Benson is the president of Panhellenic.

posing this change,” Dittman said.
“We have always asked students to
pick a course, not a particular time or
session, but with Internet registration,
they would be able to do so. Some
professors are not too happy about
that.”

Many students feel that W&L’s
present method of registration lacks a
uniform policy and that students that
abide by the rules are often at a disad-
vantage. “I got closed out of a class
because Iwaited to the day when my
class was supposed to register,” Sopho-
more Jennifer Mandeville said.

Some feel that the cost of upgrad-
ing to a modern method has more than
a financial price. With Internet regis-
tration, W&L’s tradition of personal
attention to each student might be
minimized. While students now can
plead with a professor for entrance
intoa class, the cries for help would
not be heard from a computer. “I like
dealingone-on—onewith people,”Jun-
ior Justin Riedell said. “I think they
should just hand out the registration
sheets before it starts so we don’t have
to wait out in the freezing cold outside
the registrar’s office.”

The registrar’s office has consid-
ered handing out the sheets in ad-
vance, but this increases the change of
students losing them, Dittman said.

W&L hired a computer consultant
to assess options, and will deliver a
report to President Elrod later this

month. After that, the administration
will have a better idea what direction
W&L will go in the 21st century.

DEBATE, from pg. 1

send W&L down a slippery slope by
introducing political correctness and
other evils that could eventually “trans-
form W&L into an ordinary liberal arts
school of little appeal and less repute.”

Christensen suggested that Miller’s
concerns consist of “pure paranoia” but
Miller cited “just about every other
college” as evidence for his slippery
slope argument.

“W&L isn’t going to fall for some
grand political correctness,” responded
Christensen. “We’re not interested in
that politically. I’m a conservative
Republican. We’re not pushing any-
thing but tolerance.”

Miller also confronted Christensen
about G&L’s“ostentatious”comingout
day.

“Coming out events are designed
speciﬁcally to glorify sexual orienta-
tion, nothing else,” Miller said. “If the
gay and lesbian students on this campus
feel the need to celebrate their brand of
sexuality, in my opinion they should go
ahead and do it.

“But they should retreat to their bed-
rooms-or their G&L safehouse-and do
what they need to do there.”

The debate ended abruptly, after less
than 30 minutes, when neither side had
additional questions or closing state-
ments. '

“I think Glenn came prepared and
Alex chickened out on him,” said Matt
Seals about the debate. “I think Alex
gave up-forfeited!-because he couldn’t
hold his ground on factual issues.”

POLL, from pg. 1

women viewed homosexuality as
wrong while a majority of men said
that homosexuality is wrong.

“I am very supportive of the G&L
association and homosexual rela-
tions,” said student Maria Hardin.
She also believes that “women on
this campus are generally more lib-
eral than the men.”

G&L, a controversial organization
for homosexuals and bisexuals, has
been under fire from all sides overthe
last year.

Christensen, the openly gay presi-
dent of the group, said the poll results
were “good news” for his organization.

“More and more students respect
what others want to do and decide to

keep their noses out of other people’s
business,” said Christensen, who calls
himself a conservative Republican.
“Other polls have shown that young
people are very conservative but much
more tolerant than usual.”

Freshman Grant Langston agreed
that G&L has a right to exist. “They
certainly have the right to be here,”
Langston said, “but you can’t change
people’s minds and make them accept-
able on campus.”

There are about 10 active members
in G&L, and Christensen estimates that
there are 50 to 75 homosexuals on eam—
pus. He even knows gay faculty and
staff, some of whom have gay family
members.

egregious cases.

“There are two sides to every story,” Saboe said, “we wanted to give
the person who filed the compliant a voice.” This voice allows the
victim the right to report the misconduct, appear as a witness, receive
notice of the decision and to appeal that decision.

Sandy Hooper, Executive Committee President, suggested that the
role ofthe SJC Chair in investigating reports of misconduct be limited.
Previously, the Chair investigated all reports; in the revised version
the SJC Chair will appoint another Justice to investigate.

The appeal process was shortened from seven to three days, and
final decision in an appeal case was turned over to the University
Board of Appeals. The decision previously rested with the SJC.

In order to propose amendments to the Blue Book, students now
must gain 75 signatures on a petition and submit it to a public hearing.
It then must be approved by the faculty.

This year the revamped SCC has implemented weekly meetings and
hearings which they feel has contributed to the increase in reports of
misconduct.

The current SCC, by the end of January, will have handled more
cases than were handled by the previous SCC in an entire year.

Dean Howison would rather not comment on the effectiveness and
fairness of the SCC in years’ past. SCC President Robert Covington
and Secretary Saboe have spearheaded the efforts to destroy to SCC
and replace it with the SJC. If the revisions pass in March, they will
have succeeded.

dropped all four to fall to 5-8
overall, 3-5 in the ODAC.

The week started in tough
fashion for the women as they
lost a heartbreaking 62-60 game
against Roanoke in the Warner

W&L and Roanoke were tied
at 60 when the Maroons’ Ashley
McCallum grabbed a
loose ball and sank a
game-winning
jumper with only 1.8
seconds left to break
the Generals’ hearts.

After leading 27-

Roanoke tied the score at 60 on

Playing for the last shot, W&L
turned the ball over with 18 sec-

McCallum’s game-winner.

Sophomore Amber Hinkle
led the way with 14 points for
the Generals. Freshmen Ansley

added 13 points.

W&L embarked on a long

dispatched the Generals, 81-75.

Eastern Mennonite led by

Generals caught fire as they ral-
lied back to forge a 67-66 edge
with 4:27 remaining on a Tonia
Dean bucket. EMU, however,
reeled off a 13-2 run in the next
four minutes to take command.

Morton had a huge game by
scoring a career-high 24 points,
including 9-10 at the free-throw
line. Sophomore Chrissy
Burghardt pitched in 14 points,
and Dean grabbed a career-high
16 rebounds.

The men’s basketball team is still looking
for its first win of 1997 after dropping three
games in the past week.

The Generals hung
tough in games against
Roanoke last Saturday,
Lynchburg Wednesday
and Randolph-Macon
Saturday, but dropped all
three, leaving their record
at 2-1] overall, 1-6 in the
ODAC.

The men began the
week with a home con-
test against bitter
archrival Roanoke, but
the fifth-ranked Maroons pulled away late to
win, 91-77.

The Generals trailed only 62-57 with 11:55
remaining in the second half, but Roanoke
proved too tough down the stretch, going on a
14-2 run over the next five minutes to pull
away.

The game proved even more disastrous for
the Generals when star senior guard Chris
Couzen was forced to retire after the game due
to a nagging shoulder injury. The W&L co-
captain wastheonly seniorontheteam and will
finish an excellent career in third place on the
W&L all-time steals list.

Freshman center Rich Peterson had a mon-
ster game, scoring a career-high 28 points and

 

pulling down 11 rebounds. Freshman forward
Scott Hudson also had a career-high with his 15
points.

Washington and Lee remained at home
Wednesday night to entertain Lynchburg, but
the Generals succumbed, 83-77. W&L started
the game on fire, shooting an impressive 61
percent from the field in the first half to lead 46-
45 at halftime. The Generals extended the lead
to 51-45 early in the second stanza.

After Lynchburg rallied to take the lead, the
