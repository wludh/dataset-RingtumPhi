The natives were restless at the Fancy Dress "A

broke out between several area residents and \Vil.\'ll-

Miller and Mark Davis.

A Buena Vista man provoked the fight and was
immediately ejected from the Pavillion, Director
of Security Michael Young said. The man was
placed in jail for drutik in public.

Several area men were barreling through the
crowd when one pushed a W&Lwomati into Miller.

"I asked the guy what his problctii was, and the

Miller was uninjured. ‘‘It‘s a shame that ruffi-

Miller said. ‘

Other than the fight, the concert went. “rela-

Starer did not place in the competition,
qualifying was a big honor for the six-

Clinton, ought to be forced to bear the
entire burden of the punishment.

Even further evidence of such in-
justice in campaign finance on the
other side of the aisle is with Senator
Alfonse D’Amato (R-NY). He has
already amassed a campaign fund of
over $2 million dollars for his re-
election efforts. Hc had made it nearly
impossible foran_v challenger-- with-
out D’Amato’s name recognition nor
the ability to raise nearly the same
amount of money-- to mount a win-
ning eampaign. He has, in essence,
bought his re-election.

The problem that the 17th Amend-
ment sought to correct in 1913 by
requiringthepopularelectionofSena-
tors has returned. It has become clear
thatthetimehas cometimeforchange
on both ends of the mall, both the
executive and legislative branches.

l\vill not use this column todefend
theactionsofPresidcnt Clinton. There
have been some definite breeches of
the law that do warrant further inves-
tigation. But President Clinton's ac-
tions are not the problem. There are a
mere symptom of a plague that is not
only ruining the character and pur-
pose ofour electionsbut infectingour
eiitire system of government as well.

It should be that ideas count more
than money. ft is clear thought that

this is presently not the case.
Theodore Sorensen, in “Why I Am
a Democrat,” states it best: “What
a tragedy that the.world’s leading
democracy features the \vorld’s
mostexpensive political campaign
system, requiring most candidates
in both parties to spend a majority
of their campaign hours not dis-
cussing or studying issues, but par-
ticipating in a process that inher-

ently smacks of conflicts of inter-
est and corruption.”

Don’t the American people
want representatives that have the
best ideas and not the best tech-

‘Scandal not limited to exeeuive branch

niques for raising money?

Americans need to examine the
role that money and influence
plays in our democracy. It is quite
clear that the recent debates in
Congress regardingtelecommuni-
cations, electricity deregulation
and most notoriously, health care,
all smacked of special interest
money. Surely, the system that
we have now is not what the
founders ever intended or could
have imagined. ln Federalist #10,
Jant;-s Madison warns us of the
danger of factions on the legisla-
tive process. \\-"hat not
predict was the influence of fac-
tions or special interests on cam-
paigns. lle assumed that the elec-
tions of public figures would rest
on the competition between ideas.
This system has been destro_ved
b_v the deleterious effects of
money-interests.

In order to fix this problem and
to ensure the continuation of our
system of democracy, what we
need is a bipartisan effort which
would change the laws to stress
ideas and the greatest public good
over the intercs_t of the factions.
Only then will we have a func-
tioning democracy that best fits
the founders’ intentions.

Fancy Dress weekend is com ing to
a close. lt was my finest one ever, and
I saw things that I will always remem-
bcr— from some girl who fell flat on
her drunken back at the ball to my
friend Jon getting stopped by the cops
three times in four blocks. But now all

GreenLand
Betsy Green ’97

that remains is a pile ofparty pic slips
on my dresser, the SAB stamp on my
hand and the lingering taste of the
cigar l smoked after the ball.

So I guess it’s time to move on to
the next glamorous event—tonight
(assuming you read this on Monday)
is Oscar night.

l’ve heard a lot of people complain
about the Oscars. The show is too
long, thcjokes arcn’t funny and so on.
But I love the Oscars. I love seeing
what everyone wears. I can’! \vait to
hearthc silly songs Billy Crystal makes
up. I love everything from the mind-
less banter to the cheesy dance mem-
bers.

I read that this year plain folks like
you and me were able to submit jokes
to the Oscars over the lnternet. I
wanted to swamp them with really
good stuff like about how men always
leave the toilet seat up.

Up for Best Picture this year are
“Secrets and Lies,” “Fargo,” “The
English Patient,” “Shine” and
“Jerry Maguirc.” The only ones
l’ve seen are “Fargo” and “Jerry
l\/laguire.” Maybe it’s me, but I
don’t expect “Shine” to be hitting
the State Theater any time soon.
One can’t help but feel a tad unso-
phisticated. Sure, maybe l won’t
have much opportunity to see Cool
independent movies, but anything with
.lonathan Taylor-Thomas in it. I can
see anytime.

So, my choice is between “Fargo"
and “Jerry Maguire.” “Jerry
M aguire” was a real ly good movie.
I thought it would be a nice ro-
mantic comedy, but there was a
lot more to it than that. But can
you honestly say it was the best
movie of the entire year‘? That it

 

 

should get the same honor as
“Bra\'eheart” or ‘‘Schindler’s
List?” 'l'herc’sjust no way. “l’argo,"
on the other hand, was great. It was
dark, it was funny and it had an amaz-
ing performance by Frances
McDonald.

Here are someofmy othcrthoughts
about nominees. Ralph Fiennes is up
for Best Actor for his role in “The
English Patient.” Ficnnes really irks
me since he pronounces his first name
“Ralf.” Until the man admits his name

is Ralph —— “Rallt” —— he’ll get no
Oscar from me. l’d rather give it to
someone with a good honest, non-
pretentious name like Woody
H arrelson or Billy Bob Thorton.
There are some great nominees for
Best Supporting Actor. Ed Norton’s
performance in “Primal Fear” was
outstanding. Too had everything
else about the movie sucked. Wil-
liam H. Macy was fantastic in
“Fargo." l-le was twiteliy, ner-
vousand pathetic. You wanted to
smack him the entire time. Out-
standing. But l’ll have to go with
Cuba Gooding, Jr. from “Jerry
Maguire.” He was good and every-
thing, but I give him the edge for
showing his butt. Film needs more.

“Bela Fleck and the Flecktones“
blends banjo and harmonica with synthe-
sized percussion to deliver a butt-kicking

7 performance.

The band will play at Waslrington and
Lee University Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. in
the Pavilion. The doors will open at 7:30.
and there will be a beer garden for anyone
over 21.

Bela Fleck “caught the banjo bug from
the Beverly Hillbillies theme. and his first
banjo came at age 15,” according to an
interview with Nathan Torkington. Fleck
was playing folk guitar before he received
a banjo from his grandfather. The progress
he made on the banjo astounded even his
guitar teacher. “Suddenly I got into the

‘Y banjo. and he was shocked at how fast I
took to that,” Fleck said.

Fleckattended the New York City I Iigh
School of Music and Art. playing in the
band “Wicker’s Creek" in the evenings.
After graduating from high school. Fleck
attended the .lrrIliard Ijxtension School for
a short period of time before rrrovirrg to
Boston to play in the band "Tasty licks,"
fronted by Jack Tottle.

The first recorded appearance of Fleck

later joined the group “Spectrum” and
toured with them until 1980, when lie was

The band recorded live albums and toured
for nine years before splitting up.

In I990, “Bela Fleck and the Flecktorrcs”
played their first concert on FIeck’s “Austin
City Limits” show. “We’re going to play
some instrumental music  we don’t know
what it is,” Fleck said before the perfor-
mance. They were then signed by Warner

Brothers. Their first (self-titled) album was
nominated for a Grammy, as was their sec-
ond. They have released a total of live

that Lexington l;;;d 'r‘.\;r urriver'.sities." .\lrs. I\'oehlcr said. “We
thought that the students coming out for ice cream would keep
trs going in the winter when the business got slow.”

“Sweet Things" replaced the “Palm Parlor” (now the stu-
dents’ favorite bar) as the only ice cream shop in I.e.\ington.
"When we came, they were already switching away from ice
cream as their main priority,” Koehler said. "They were nice
enough to start sending customers asking for ice cream over to us.”

Koehler has few complaints about running a small business
and saysthey are doing well financially. The drawbacks include
long hours and less time with their 9-year-old daughter Heather.
“I like talking to all ofthe students and the tourists. But I never
have a day off,” Koehler said. “Roger is here in the afternoon
and I’m here at night.”

All twenty-four ﬂavors are home-made. “Sweet Things” is
an experience that cannot be re-created at just any home, though.
Only Roger Koehler knows the secret recipes, and he isn’t about
to dish out that scoop.

Wiedmaier said. “The music is thebasic SO’s and 90’s mix. We’ve
got a copy of the song list, and it includes everything from Michael
Jackson and Madonna to just about anything that is not too weird.
The stuff is pretty basic, but there is a wide variety. There should be
something for everyone.
