W&L Folklore: steeped in
tradition, myth and history

By ANNE.ALvoRD AND
BETHANY BAUMAN
or THE RING-TUM PHI

Washington and Lee, like most 350
year old communities has a rich folklore
all its own. We are proud ofour folklore.
As you come to be familiar with the
campus, you will get to know this folk-
lore the way you know the folklore of
your own community. We have legends
to explain most everything. Let us start
to familiarize you with some of them.

Why is Traveller buried in the
Front Lawn?

When Traveller first died, he was not
buried but stuffed. However, General
Lee’s faithful companion had a habit of
showingup where he didn'tbelong, most
likely due to the pranks of mischeivious
students, so he ws buried in the Front
Lawn. His grave is located next the the
chapel.

Why do we have a statue of
Cyrus McCormick? I

McCormick, inventer of the reaper,
was a resident of Rockbridge County
and a great supporter and benefactor of
education.

Why are the doors to the Lee
Hosue garage always open?

This is not so that everyone knows
that President Elrod drives a Volvo. The
garage was originally a stable and was
the last home ofTrave1ler, who of course
came to Lexington with Lee when he
becamepresident of the school (then
Washington College) after the Civil War.
The doors are left open so thatTraveller’s
spirit could come and go as it chooses.

What is theCadaver Society?

The Cadaver Society is an anony-

mous organization that gives a great
deal of financial support to the uni-
versity,aswellasputingflyersaround
campus several times a year.
Although we cant be sure who the
Cadaver Society is, we believe it is
made up of alumni and current stu-
dents. The
footbri d ge,

Why do all W&L students have
to pass a swim test?

This may be a question that is al-
ready plauging some of you. The story
goes that the Doremuses were passing
through Lexington one day visiting and
met a student who volunteered to show

them around. The
student laid his books

which leads to
the athletic
fields and Law
School, was
donated by the
Cadaver Soci-
ety.
Bytheway,
did you know
that our foot-
bridge is the
longest non-
suspension
footbridge in
the world?
Why are
the steps by
the arch in
G r a h a n -
Lees worn
on the sides
but not in
the middle?
It is said
that if you
walk. in the
middle rather

aside and guided the
complete strangers
around the university.

The Doremuses
were so impressed
with the friendliness
of this student, that
hewouldlay aside his
own concerns to help
them, that they do-
nated the new gym-
nasium, with one
stipulation: that ev-
ery Washington and
beestudentbeableto
swim. The reason for
this was that the
Doremus’ child had
drowned.

No one knows
who the student was
who guided the
Doremuses. He is
sometimes refered to
as ‘Washington and
Lee’s unknown sol-
dier’.

than on one of
the sides you
will have bad luck. The manifesta-
tion ofthis luck is not exactly known.
Some say that you will not graduate,
while others say that you will fail
whatever tests you have on the day
you walk through the wrong part.
Others say it’s just bad luck in gen-
eral.

 

File Photo

Several times a year the Cadaver Society blankets the
campus with their ﬂyers adorned with a ‘C’and a skull.

How did FD
start?

Annie Jo Robertson White, the Uni-
versity Librarian at the time,and the
woman after whom our library catalog
system is named, started the tradition of
FD in 1907.

She had directed a student play to raise
money for a student organization and had
raised $44 more than she had promised
the organization, so she decided to use the
extra money for a small student dance,
which would be a costume ball. She sent
out invitations and required that students
must pay $2 for their costumes. Those
who could not afford costumes could
work for them.

Admission to the ball was free and
music was provided by an orchestra from
VMl.

Atthetime,theadministration was not
so permissive ofsuch ‘frivilous’ things as
student dances. Students were required
to be in class the following day at 9 a.m.
with all assignments complete.

Incidentally, the approximate cost of
FD in recent years has been $80,000.

What was Tucker Hall origi-
nally? Tucker Hall origninally housed
the Law School. The building was ex-
tremely unattractive, an eyesore to the
otherwise breathtaking collonade. The
building was destroyed by fire, and the
story goes that because the building was
so incredibly ugly students were ‘lining
up to take credit for the deed’.

The cm W:

A drooling, pathetic sequel

BY ALEX CHRISTENSEN
PHI MovIE CRITIC

71}: Half a star out of four
The pitch: “lt’ll be
like...um...The Crow.”

1994’s The Crow, starring
the late Brandon Lee, contained
many very specific pleasures.
Lee’s acting was wonderful, the
concept of a truly “dark” super-
hero——-so dark he’s already
dead——was original and inter-
estingly handled. The film also
used miniatures, cityscapes, and
fast-paced action shots to create
a film with a deep mood and
texture. Of course, there were
some hokey elements, such as
the plucky little heroine (Roch-
elle Davis), the almost inexcus-
ably over-the-top villains
(Michael Wincottand Bai Ling),
and Ernie Hudson. Still and all,
the stunning visual elements
combined with some genuine
emotional impact to produce a
very affecting and entertaining
film that, largely because of the
death of star Brandon Lee dur-
ing shooting, has been labeled a
“cult classic.”

This is not a review of The
Crow, ofcourse, but a review of
its pathetic, drooling sequel, The
Crow: City of/lngels. When the
first news about this movie sur-
faced, it seemed like a terrible
idea to some and an exciting one
to others: bring back the Crow
character and basically the same
plot with a new actor and try to
reproduce some of the success,
both artistically and commer-
cially, of the first film.

So there are two ways to look
at it. First, does it succeed in
reproducing any of what The
Crow did? And second, does it
stand alone, avoiding being too
derivative of the original or de-
void of its own character as
a film?

As far as the first question,
the answer, unfortunately, is a
resounding no. The second an-
swer is no, too. Didn’t want to
keep anybody in suspense. This
Crow is deeply, deeply bad. The

screenplay, credited to David S. _
Goyer, seems like it was written ’

by the proverbial thousand mon-
keys at typewriters. Basically, a
guy and somebody he loves (Eric
Draven’s girlfriend in The Crow,
Ashe Corven’s son in City of

Angels) get killed by a bunch of
punk-rocker/occultistdrug deal-
ers, and the fellow comes back
as a mime-faced killer ghost es-
corted by a spirit guide in the
shape of a crow. Hence the name.
But Goyer wasn’t satisfied with
just this straightforward sce-
nario; he cluttersthe screen with
portentously named loser drug
dealers and pseudo-mythologi-
cal weirdos and sets the whole
thing in an apparently plague-
ravaged L.A., for no other rea-
son than that he wants to mix in
the celebration of the Day of the
Dead, a plot device so extrane-
ous that I will say no more
about it.

This Crow is
deeply, deeply bad.
The screenplay,
credited to David S.
Goyer, seems like it
was written by the
proverbial thousand
monkeys at typewrit-
ers.

Goyer also mixes up the
timeline, a device that can be
used to reveal character and ex-
plore connections in a more com-
plex story, but which here just
endsupbeingannoying.Westart
out with Sarah, a holdover from
the first film, now played by Mia
Kershner. Apparently she is ob-
sessed with death or something,
who knows. lt’s hard to care.
She lives in this big dank loft
and paints depressing pictures
and lights candles. Then she
starts dreaming about this guy

drowning. Well, in fact, he has ,.

drowned. He’s the new Crow!
Surprise! Withholding informa-
tion from the audience that they
already know coming into the
theater is just plain -dippy. And-

’ get together somehow and the
Crow goes to kill all these folks
who killed him and his little son.

could just go on with the story,

‘ The Student Voice of Washington and Lee University
Founded September 18, 1897

Now that you’ve arrived

i
To the students...

Welcome to Washington and Lee. We’re pretty sure you’ve

. ‘heard that a few times already, but we really are glad you’re here.

Don’t be so cynical. If we weren’t glad you were here, we would

have made you move your own things into the dorm. The FOC

wouldn’t have planned a week of activities for you and Dean

1 Manning wouldn’t know all of your names and most of your home
towns.

You deserve to be here. You’re intelligent, talented, accom-
plished, honored, and have frighteningly high test scores. But
you’re not just great applications and good essays, you’re
interesting people to know. Your job this week is to get to know
eachother, as well as returning students. Sounds easy, doesn’t it?
Really, it isn’t very hard, but it is a lot of work. We’ll try to get to
know you, but you have to help. Get involved on campus right

‘away. Follow the speaking tradition. Go out and meet people.
This week is one of the only chances you’ll have to do that without
having to worry about going to class and getting work done too.

.5 Take advantage of it.

A One reason you came to W&L was probably because you
wanted to be challenged. With the great classes, great social life

, and huge array of extra-curricular activities available at W&L,

" you are going to be challenged. There are countless opportunities
here. Take classes that interest you. Say hello to everyone you
pass on the hill. Get to know your professors. Learn the art of
working hard and playing hard. Join organizations. All of these
elements are essential to the Washington and Lee education.
Don’t let yourself miss out.

For now, be happy you’re here. The summer is over and the day

* you’ve been awaiting for months is here. Take just a minute and
be really proud of yourself. Now get back to moving into your
room and saying good-bye to your parents. Speaking of your

’, parents...

To the parents...

We’ll be honest with you. We have no idea what you’re feeling

’ right now. But we’ll tell you what we do know: we know you’re

probably scared, excited, proud, anxious and maybe wondering

how your child, who you can’t remember making his own bed
without being reminded, is going to live on his own.

Your “little boy” or “little girl” is going to grow up a lot in the
next few months. Scary, isn’t it? By the next time you see him or
her, there will be a whole side to your child that you’ve never seen

4 before. There will be a ‘person in your child’s body that gets
himself up for class at ungodly hours of the morning, does his own
ironing, gets his homework done on time all by himself, and
voluntarily eats vegetables. That’s something to be even prouder
of than your “Washington and Lee Mom” and “Washington and
Lee Dad” t-shirts.

   

t
. wt, ,
‘*’ Your child is here because Washington and Lee knows he can
handle everything that’s about to happen to him. You know it too,
‘‘ and so does your child. Maybe it won’t be easy going the whole
way, but with a child old enough to be going to college, you already

know that much better than we do.

K. There might be weekends where your child doesn’t call, or
weeks where there’s not a letter in the mailbox. That doesn’t mean
there’s something wrong. More than likely, it means everything
is great. W&L is a busy place for everyone, but add to that all the

,4 stress of the first semester — meeting people, learning to deal with
professors and figuring out what days it’s really best not to eat in
the dining hall —— and you’re lucky to get any sleep at all.

‘ Have faith,. It’s going to be fine. Take eight rolls of film before
‘you leave Lexington. Show your “My kid goes to Dubyuhne1l”
keychain to everyone in the office. By the time you’re done
looking at all of the pictures you took and everyone has seen your
keychain, your “little man” or “little woman” is going to be home

‘V for break.

Somany new freedoms, so little time

Green Land
Betsy Green, ’97

It’s always so hard to decide what
to say in the freshman issue. All of
you are still forming your first impres-
sions of W&L and of college in gen-
eral. There’s so much that I could say
to you, even beyond the “Hi, what’s
your name? So where are you from?
Where do you live?” that you’ll be

hearing so much of in the next week, , _

but I don’t know where to start. I
know this sounds cheesy, but you are
startinga great adventure. I remember
my freshman year so vividly. More
than anything, l remember what an
unbelievably cool place l thought
Washington and Lee was. Here are
son1e of the highlights:

l. Class schedule. I had no
idea, in high school, that I would ever
have the opportunity not to have class
every day. Fall term my freshman

' year I had no classes on Tuesdays or

Thursdays. And my earliest class was
a 9 a.m. P.E. class. Wow.

2. Lexington Night Life.
Who knew there was one? Yet every
night there was new entertainment to
be found, new places to see, people to
meet. Included in that, of course,
were...

3. Older boys talking to
me. Don’t ever feel you have to
apologize for being a mere freshman.

You are new, exciting and exotic.
Women, I hope you are smart enough
to know that those older boys talking
to you are hoping to impress you with
the fact that they are, well, older boys
talking to you. They may be trying to
exploit your freshman naiveté. My
freshman year hallmates were on to
that and decided to use it to our advan-
tage, compiling a list of Pickup Lines
For Freshman Women (do any of you
remember this, ex-hallmates?).
Among them were such gems as, “If
only I could find a way to forget my
ex-_boyfrie_nd,f’. “_l,’ve‘_n‘ever_been in a
fraternity house before,” “My parents
wouldn’t let me date in high school,”
and the classic, “l’m young, innocent
and far away from home.”

4. Change in proximity to
parents and friends. In high school,
your old life, you lived with your
parents and visited your friends,. In
college you live with your friends and
visit your parents. And ideal setup.
Anytime you wantcompany, go down-
stairs and see one of your new bud-
dies. Siton one ofthe benches outside
Graham-Lees anytime to talk about
anything or nothing.

5. Freedom, sweet free-
dom. Nolonger do you have to worry
about getting home on time. Now it
doesn’t matter to anyone but you if
you go home at all. do you want to
have cereal fordinner? Go right ahead.
Getatattoo. Pierce something. Grow
your hair long. Don’t go to class next
week. lf you want to do any of those
things, no one’s going to stop you.

Granted, none of these things is a good
idea, and you’ve probably already ﬁg-

ured that out, but isn’t it cool that if '

you wanted to, you could?

6. TheallureofLetltiaPate

to college, all a place like this really
had to offer me was makeup and tooth-
paste. But once I became a college
student, whole new sections opened
up for me. New sheets, towels and my
own box of laundry detergent made
me feel so sophisticated. And why not
a desk for my computer or candles for

Miriello’s Generals begin season with a “Never Quit” attitude

BY BETHANY BAUMAN
PHI Sronrs EDITOR

If your opponents are bigger,
stronger, and faster, you have to
work harder, longer, and smarter.
This is the
p h i lo s o -
ph y that
has been
d ri v i n g
the Wash-
ington
and Lee
f o o t b a l l
t e a m
t h r o u g h
the past
t w 0
weeks of pre-season practices.
Sixty-four of the sixty-six play-
ers who reported to‘ camp re-
main, and all are focused on
winningthe September 14th sea-

 

And just so you ‘don tjthmk we re‘ forgetting a V ut the 
men’s soccer freshmen...Final cuts are tomorrow  we _

son home opener against Ursinus
College.

Head coach Frank Miriello
will be looking to his corps of
skill position players, which re-
mains almost intact from a year
ago, to lead the team this season.
Junior Brooks Fischer returns to
the quarterback position, where
last year he won all—conference
honors. Fischer will be backed
up by junior Tommy Ruegger
and freshman Christian
Batcheller.

Ruegger may also play a role
in the receiving corps, which
has a large hole to fill after los-
ing ’96 graduate James Urban,
who led the Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference in receiving last
year with 32 receptions. Junior
Nick Hodge and sophomore
Chas Chastain also return for
the Generals’ offense at the
wideout positions. Hodge

 

should make a major contribu-
tion, after snagging 28 catches
last year. Chastain led the Gen-
erals in scoring for the ’95 sea-
son with six touchdowns, how-
ever, returns this year after hav-
ing knee surgery in the spring.
He has had some trouble with
the knee during the pre-season,
but no conclusions have been
made about his status for the
beginning of the regular sea-
son. Senior Jake Buckner has
been moved from the fullback
position to wide receiver.
Rounding out the receiving
corps will be tight ends senior
Jon Gardner and sophomore
David Ritchey. Freshman J.T.
Malatesta has impressed
Miriello and could possibly see
sometimeinareceiverposition
this season.

W&L’s backfield looked
strong coming into the pre-sea-
son,buthas hitafew snags over
the last two weeks. Junior
tailback standout Seth
McKinley has been sidelined
for what will most likely be the
first three games of the season
following foot surgery last
week. He will be replaced by
seniorJohn Marshall and sopho-
more Floyd Young, two talented
players, but ones who do not
have the same level of experi-
encethat McKinley has. Sopho-

more Lee Swomley has also been
moved over from his defensive
position to help out in the offen-
sive backfield. The backﬁeld
will be anchored by senior quad-
captain Aaron Wilkinson, who
returns to the fullback position
after catching 22 passes for 200
yards, and running 57 times for
237 yards last season.

The strength of the Generals
passing game will depend on the
offensive line. Last year, the line
graduated four players who had
started for at least three years.
Junior center Stefan Neumeister
is the only returning starter to
this unit. However, with seniors
Ed Zelezen, Will Hill and Matt
May and sophomore Marc
Granger, what the o-line may lack
in experience it makes up for in
determination and skill. Miriello
is also pleased with the pre-sea-
son performance of freshmen
John Sensing and Jady Koch on
the o-line.

On the defensive side, the
Generals should be strong, de-
spite the loss of ’96 graduate All-
American tackle Robert Hull.
The defensive line will be ‘led by
senior quad-captain Peyton Wil-
liams, who will switch to tackle
this year after playing at
noseguard last season. Junior
Omar Moneim willbe at the other
tackle position. Takingwilliams’

place at noseguard is senior Neil
Kelleter, provided that he is able
to overcome minor injuries sus-
tained in the pre-season. Junior
John Thrall will back Kelleter at
the nose. The future of the d-
line looks good with this year’s
additions of freshmen Scott King
and Bill McGettigan.

Probably the strongest ele-
ment ofthe Generals’ defense is
a solid group of inside lineback-
ers. Senior Travis Wisdom and
senior quad-captain McGuire
Boyd will lead this group. Both
have seen time on the field since
their freshman year. The line-
backers have also acquired a nice
addition this season in freshman
Mike Moore.

The defensive backﬁeld may
be a cause for concern this sea-
son in that it lacks depth.
Cornerback junior Ryan
Fletemeyer will lead will lead
the group. Junior John Benazzi
and senior Brian Zagol should
both see time at the other corner
position. A bigger concern for
Miriello is the lack of experi-
ence at the safety position. Jun-
ior Lee Miller and senior Chris
Watson are slated to start, with
juniorJeff McKenna and sopho-
more Trey Carr backing them
up.
Despite a few areas of con-
cern, Miriello isoptimistic about

the upcoming season. He and
hiscoachingstaffarebeing more
demandingoftheirplayers,call-
ing for attention to detail and a
“One fail, we all fail” attitude.
But Miriello says these athletes
are some ofthe hardest working
he’s been involved with in a

longtime. “All we ask is all yoi
have” will be the team’s creet
this year. They are up to the
challengeofwinningtheopener
as well as posting a winning
record this season. According
to Miriello, “They are really or
a mission.”

Mens and womens soccer teams return
many veterans for a bright season outloolw

BY BETHANY BAUMAN
PHI SPORTS EDITOR

Both the men’sandwomen’s
soccer squads have a strong
core ofreturning players. This,
in addition to some talented
recruits, should make for two
very exciting seasons to watch.

Head women’ssoccercoach
Jan Hathorn returns sixteen
letterwinners from last year’s
squad. And they all have one
unmentioned goal in mind.
They do
not want
their sea-
son to end
before
Nov e m -
ber 3rd,
the day of
the Old
D 0 min -
ion Ath-
letic Con-
fe re n c e
~ champi-
onship game. ln order to get
there, Hathorn will be relying
on a strong offense. Returning
to the forward line will be se-
nior tri-captain Michelle
Bauman,juniors Erica Reineke
and Leighton Kirby, and sopho-
more Karin Treese. Bauman is
W&L’s all-timeleading scorer
and earned first team All-
ODAC and third team All-
South honors last year. Reineke
set the school record in 1994
for points in a season with 47,
but was forced to miss part of
last season with an injury.
Treese garnered second team
all—conference honors last sea-
son after tallying 14 goals and
10 assists, making her the sec-
ond leading scorer in the

 

ODAC. Kirby wasasecondteam
All-ODAC pick last season as
well. Junior Christy Meade and
sophomore Caroline Keen should
also see time at the forward posi-
tion.

Keen and Kirby will lend
their talents to the midfield in
addition. Already combining for
a strong corps at that position are
senior Allison Warner, junior
Claire Bowers, and sophomore
Elizabeth Ritchey.

The depth of the women’s
soccer team does not stop with
the offense. The defensive unit
returns last year’s freshman
standout Nicole Johnson. John-
son was a first team All-ODAC
and third ‘team All-South pick
last season. Adding experience
to the backline are sophomores
Lauren Francis and Kelly Norton,
junior Lorraine Taurassi, and se-
niorstri-captain Sara Benson and
Lamandra Jenkins. In addition,
Hathorn is also looking for fresh-
man defender Ginny Gernigan to
make an impact this season.

In the goal cage this season
for the Generals will be senior
tri-captain Beth Mozena. She
has recorded 13 shutouts in her
career at W&L and allows on
average only 1 .34 goals per game.
Freshman Stephanie McKnight
willback Mozenaupatthegoalie
position.

The biggest challenge for
Hathorn’s squad will be ﬁnding
what combination of these tal-
ented women will be most effec-
tive.

Men’s head soccer coach
Rolph Piranian is also dealing
with a very talented team this
year. Fourteen players from last
year's squad who saw the field in
at least ten games have returned,
hoping to improve on last

Junior forward Erica Reineke

season’s 7-9 record. Piranian
will be loking for another big
year from sophomore forward
Sam Chase. As a freshman,
Chase tallied 18 goals and 37
points, both single—season W&L
records. He was the ODAC’s
leading scorer and earned sec-
ond team all-conference hon-
ors. Also returning to the for-
ward line this season are junior
Gordon Meeker and senior Dave
Corning. Meeker had two goals
and six assists in 1995, making
him the second leading return-
ing scorer on this year’s squad.
Corning will split his time be-
tween the front and the midfield
this season. Freshman Jamie
Parker has stood out in the pre-
season at the forward position
and is expected to see serious
playing time. Another new ad-
dition to the front line is sopho-
more transfer Jeff Weikel, who
played for Virginia Tech in
1994. Piranian hopes to see the
scoring spread out among these
players this year, as opposed to
concentrating just on Chase.

The midfield is one of two
areas of concern for Piranian.
Stepping upto ﬁllthegap left by
graduation wll be seniors Andy
Dater and Mike Matechak, and
sophomore Jon Wright. Several
freshmen midfielders have im-
pressedPiranian,includingMike
Kaczka.

The Generals defense looks
extremely strong going into the
regular season. Sophomore tri-
captain sweeper Mikel Parker
will lead the back field this year.
Parker was selected to the ﬁrts
team All-ODAC and the second
team All-South after his incred-
ible first season. The Generals’
defense will be rounded out by
juniors tri-captain Colin

Connolly and Kingsley Chukwu
and senior Bill Sigler. Chukwu
received an All-ODAC honor-
able mention last year while
Sigler moved up to the number
four spot on W&L’s all-time
assist tally with 14. Joining the
defense this year will be former
midfielder Mike Germain.
Germain has put in a commend-
able performanceinthe midfield
for the past two years, but will
now try to add to the Generals’
defensive talent pool. Fresh-
man Ben Thompson will also
make his debut on the defense
this year and is expected to chal-
lenge for playing time.

The second question mark fc
the team concerns the goalie:
Three goal keepers left the tear
during the pre-season, leavin
the brunt ofthe duties for senic
tri-captain Anthony Mazzarell
But Mazzarelli is certainly upt
the task, having started for 34 c
the 50 games the Generals hav
played for the past three sea
sons.

Dorofeeva, who earned all-state honors last season before
missing the ODAC meet with an injury. Joining the Generals
for the first time are junior Jana Heisler, and freshmen Lezael
Haynes, Autumn Oczkowski, Jennifer Webb, and Amie

Six freshmen will join seven returners to comprise this
year’s W&L water polo team. The squad is coming off ofa 10-

Hopkins at the Eastern Division lll championships. Senior co-
captains James Silberstein and Pete Sorensen, as well as Nathan
Hottle, are W&L’s top returning players. They will lead the
squad through a tough Collegiate Water Polo Association
(formerly the Eastern WPA) schedule, which includes contests
with Navy and Richmond. Head coach Page Remillard will be
looking for strong performances from the freshmen, especially
goalie Ryan Noble who could be a big addition to the squad.

The volleyball team also adds six freshmen to its roster this
season. In 1995, the team captured the school's first ODAC
volleyball championship. The Generals will be looking not
only to retain their ODAC title this season, but to move up in the
NCAA South region rankings. Junior middle blocker Hilary
Martin is the top returner for W&L. She will co-captain the
team with senior middle blocker Virginia Yocrg. Outside
hitters Holly Thomsen and Megan Snodgrass in addition to
setters Alison Beard and Lee Ann Gschwind will be offensive
threats for-the Generals. Add to this mix freshmen Carolyn
Carson, Sarah Ellis, Lindsay Gatling, Megan Macy, Martha
Pettyjohn, and Nancy Reinhart and W&L volleyball could be
looking at a big boost in its NCAA South regional ranking.
