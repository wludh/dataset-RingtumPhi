Warngr gampaign plays on W&L rgots
Commercial set at Lee Chapel

BY DAVID BALSLEY
PHI STAFF WRITER

tudents of Washington and Lee

University, as well as Lee

Chapel, are featured in one of

Senator John Wamer’s current televi-

sion campaign commercials. The com-

mereiahwhiclrwastapeu our mg IVIOCK

Convention, depicts four students walk-

ing with Senator Warner away from
Lee Chapel.

Eric Peterson, a spokesman for

-=-Wm-ner;=-commented-that Warner ap-

proached four students “who just hap-
pened to be passing by” and asked them
if they would walk with hifri and possi-

bly appear in one of his commercials.
Accordingto Peterson, thestudents“vol-
unteered their time to walk with Senator
Warner and to discuss their lives, their
hopes, their plans for the future.” The
result of the taping is a brief segment in
one of Wamer’s campaign commer-
cials in which the four students appear
alongside Warner.

Peterson stated that Warner wanted
to feature students in his commercial in
order to convey the message that he
“represents all Virginians, not only all
economic strata, but also strata of all
youth.” In addition, the commercial is
intended to depict Warner as concerned
for Virginia’s workers, as well as its
students, whom Peterson described as

“the next generation of workers.”
Peterson added, “Plus the fact that
Washington and Lee is his alma mater.”

Warner, who graduated from W&L
with a B.S. degree in basic engineering
in 1949, has since served as a member
of the university’s Board of Trustees
and is a member of the Washington and
Lee Alpha“€hapter of Omicron Delta’
Kappa. With regard to Wamer’s ties to
W&L, Tim Moorehead, a Washington
and Lee alum who works with Senator
Warner, commented that Warner
wanted to “feature W&L prominently
in his commercial.’.’.. -

The commercial is programmed for
“high saturation” andairs" throughout
Virginia.

Freshmen express W&L dissatisfaction

BY JENNIFER MENDOCHA
Pm STAFF WRITER

his has been quite a year for students ex-
pressing dissatisfaction with aspects of life
at W&L.

It seems that the freshman class in particular has
been especially straightforward and outspoken. Both
campus newspapers have published editorials ex-
pressing frustration with various aspects of life at
W&L, from the fratemity-oriented social scene to
the dubious characterization of what should and
should not constitute an Honor Violation.

Brian Jacob, a freshman who intends to transfer
at the end of the year, suggests two predominant
reasons why students may be dissatisfied.

“The social life...people don’t have an altema-
tive to fraternity parties. Secondly, people here tend
to be less accepting of differences. The fact that
W&L is so homogeneous could be overlooked if
people were more accepting and open-minded.”

Jacob notes that it is not necessarily that Lexing-
ton is too dull.

“When one is around the right people, location
doesn’t matter.”

He does, however, indicate that more options
need to be available to independent students.

“The Independent Student Union is weak and
disorganized. That is, if it actually exists.”

Several freshmen, afraid of fraternity reprisals
and various other negative repercussions, com-
mented anonymously.

A freshman female noted that “everything is a
date function...FD, Foxﬁeld...and it all involves

drinking to excess. The entire premise of the ‘ honor’
speech we heard at the beginning of the year at Lee
Chapel is lost in the hypocrisy of the drunk students
televised at Mock Con. W&L is a closed society
with old money tradition, and the administration
doesn’t have an interest in changing it.”

Other random W&L gripes procured from the
disgruntled Class of ‘99 include:

“People here are immature. They’re largely from
sheltered backgrounds, and don’t have much life
experience.”

“No college is truly realistic, but W&L is particu-
larly far from reality.”

“Everyoneisthesame...carbon copies ofJ.Crew.”

“People here aren’t as smart as I had hoped they
would be.”

“I considered transferring at the start of the year
because I felt that W&L was like a country club,
detached from the real world.”

Everyone remembers the words of freshman Bill
Overbaugh, who questioned the implications of our
Honor Code in a controversial editorial.

Overbaugh emphasizes that he does not think
that students feel a specific dissatisfaction with
W&L. Rather, he perceives a need to “make our
little section of pretty good into perfect.”

Although he understands that the Honor Code
cannot be governed by the beliefs of one person, he
hopes that debating the issue can strengthen the
situation.

“To me, it is very clear that underage drinking is
against the honor code.”

He emphatically states that he is “not trying to
alter the principles” of W&L; he merely “saw a
weakness” and questioned it.

Overbaugh claims “many people have responded
in trying to follow the Honor Code a little more
closely, which is exactly what I wanted.”

In spite of the many criticisms of W&L, most
people praise their professors and agree that aca-
demics here are a great strength.

Junior Paul Saboe, from an upperclassman’s
vantage point, disagrees with recent remarks that
underclassmen are becoming increasingly socially
inept.

“We are getting smarter students, but they are
still well-rounded. More freshmen can be found
doing their own thing, however.”

Freshman Nathan Hager received much criti-
cism regarding his editorial, which dealt with his
conception of the Honor Code.

He is tired of the whole debate and stresses that
“It’s not a big deal to me anymore. We have a lying,
cheating, stealing system at W&L, and that’s ﬁne. I
must learn to focus on the positive aspects of W&L
and not the little things like an Honor System that
won’t exist three years from now when I leave this
school.”

It is difficult to pinpoint reasons for what
appears to be discontentment among the Class
of ‘99. '

It is clear, however, that grievances are found not
only in the freshman class; many of the aforemen-
tioned quotes could have been uttered by any num-
ber of students on campus.

Criticisms alone, though, are next to meaningless.
If students can utilize their criticisms in a productive
manner, to implement changes in what he or she
perceives are faulty aspects of W&L, our community
will be improved, rather than weakened.

Edwards advises women on ‘glass ceiling’

BY MICHAEL HEwi.Ei'r
oodlefest. Betsy Pm STAFF WRITER

he glass ceiling still exists but

opportunities are opening up

for women, said Shirley
Edwards on Wednesday, May 15 in
Room 221 in the C-School.

Her comments were part of a lec-
ture entitled “Breaking through the
Glass Ceiling.” The lecture was spon-
sored by Decade.

According to a report from Presi-
dent Bush’s Commission to study the
glass ceiling, the executive suite is
still overwhelmingly white and male.
Ninety-ﬁve percent of all Fortune 500

CEO’s are male.

“The revolution has not reached
top management.”

Edwards also said women, regard-
less of educational levels, continue to
make less than men. In 1994, men
earned 24 percent more than women
for similar work. Even in those jobs
that women usually dominate such as

teaching or nursing, women still earn
less than men.

Other subtle differences occur. Ex-
ecutive training seminars by business
schools are exclusively male. These
seminars exemplify one of the ways
for people to get into senior manage-
ment.

There is some good news, Ms.
Edwards said. The Labor Department
has shown an increase in female man-
agers, who make up 41 percent of all
managers. .

Corporate leaders have become in-
creasingly cognizant of the glass ceil-
ing and the need for diversity.

“What motivates them is the bot-
tom line.”

Edwards said these CEO’s see an
increasingly global economy where
an appreciation of different cultures
will become important. By the next
century, more minorities and women
will enter the workplace and might
actually outnumber males, she said.

Certain industries have already re-
sponded to such trends. The high—tech

and service industries have been bet-
ter able to deal with cultural changes.

Catalyst, a women’s advocacy
group, said 62 percent of corporate
executives want women to be pro-
moted fairly. ,

“It’s a business decision—not a
sense of righteousness.”

Edwards argues that CEO’s feel
the pressure of giving women a fair
chance and are seeing the costs of the
glass ceiling. But she warned that
there are still problems, citing one
study that said it would take 475 years
for women to get equality.

She gave future women leaders
some advice. She urged them to take
control of their career and to aggres-
sively seek out challenging and risky
assignments that would give them
broad-based experiences.

“The inability to get high-risk as-
signments is probably the biggest
contributer to the glass ceiling.”

She stressed that taking risky as-
signments gets women exposure to
people they might not have had the

opportunity to deal with. More impor-
tantly, women should not get too spe-
cialized in their jobs but should branch
out.

Also, women must find mentors,
regardless of sex, who will help them
along in their careers, she said.

Edwards encouraged women to
support each other and form women’s
groups.

“lt’s not any different from what
men do—it’s called the Good Ole
Boy’s Network.”

Edwards said women should build
confidence in themselves and market
themselves. Having more women in a
company is a chance to humanize it,
she said. And just because a woman
has a baby does not mean she has
given up her career. Most women re-
turn to work a few months after giving
birth. She said companies need to make
the transition into work easier.

With all the challenges women face
in the workplace, Edwards remains con-
ﬁdent and emphasizes that the opportu-
nity is out there for those who seek it.

Green Land
Betsy Green ‘97

fter I stood in line for reg
istration for fall term, I
found a piece of paper

clipped to my form that really made
me think: the application for my
degree. The paper itself wasn’t
anything spectacular. They just
wanted to confirm that my name is
Elizabeth Ann Green, what my
majors are, who my advisors are,
and that I want a BA,

Still, its amazing to me to think
that soon I will be Elizabeth Ann
Green, with a BA from Washing-
ton and Lee. I can’t imagine what
the seniors must be feeling right
now. Pretty soon, they’ll be faced
with car payments, voice mail, and
overtime. Instead of doing home-
work, they’ll be doing paperwork.
On a more positive note, they’ll go
out and have fun on weekends like
the rest of us do, only without that
nagging feeling that there’s work
to be done.

The sheet of paper I got also
reminded me how many credits I
had, how many I need to graduate,
and to keep in mind all of the gen
eds and PE’s I might have been
putting off. That made me think of
the things we have to go through to
graduate —- standing in PE lines,
and in my case, suffering through
some science classes, dreaming of
time I could have spent in build-
ings I like a lot more.

But although our liberal arts
education here at W&L does some
things to make us well-rounded
individualsﬂ think it’s the experi-
ence that we have here that allows

. us to be the adults so many of us
qt will have to be soon." Thereforejl
' propose the following graduation

requirements in the great study of
life. Seniors, get cracking!

Before you graduate from Wash-
ington and Lee, you should:

{:] Bounce a check.

|:] Go to class with a bad hang
over. A

E] Get sick and don’t call your
mother.

C} Use credit cards irresponsibly
and regret it.

:1 Skip a class on a beautiful day

with no regrets.

[1 Make friends with a profes
sor.

|:] Buy a Dave Matthews Band
CD.

E] Skip taco bar at the D-Hall
and go to Taco Bell.

|:] Get a Harris Teeter card.

|:] Go to the Palms on your 21st
birthday.

[:] Tell a friend from high school
that you don’t have anything
in common anymore.

week.

[:| Thank your parents for every
thing.

D Get your heart broken.

D Break someone else’s heart.

[:] Get into a ﬁght with your
roommate.

[:1 Fail a test. Survive.

Ends & Means
Joshua Heslinga ‘98

story over the past few weeks,

months, or even years, with-
out hearing about the great ﬁssure
in the GOP over the party ’s pro-life
platform plank.

The media blames the plank,
which calls for a constitutional
amendment to restore the sanctity
of unborn human life, for the loss in
1992, the alleged perception of the
GOP as extreme, the “gender gap,”
and the GOP’s poor prospects in
1996. The media is right about one
thing; The Republican Party ‘has
arrived at a defining moment.

Abortion poses the greatest
moral problem of our time, directly
involving our belief in the most
basic of all human rights- the right
to life. And there can be little scien-
tific doubt that an unborn baby is
human life.

For many Americans, the ongo-
ing furor over partial-birth abor-
tions has dramatized this truth. In
this procedure, usually performed
in the third trimester, the abortion-
ist delivers the baby, except for the
head, which is kept in the birth
canal. The abortionist then inserts a
pair of scissors into the back of the
baby ’s head and uses asuction cath-
eter to vacuum out the baby’s brain.
At this point, the abortionist com-

I t’s been hard to read a political

pletes the delivery of the dead
baby.

Earlier this year, Congress
passed HR 1833, banning partial-
birth abortions except in cases
where the mother’s life is endan-
gered. This measure passed the
House by an overwhelming 286-
129 margin and the Senate by a
54-44 tally. A December poll by
the Tarrance Group found 71% of
the people in favor of the ban and
only 16% opposed. A February
1996 poll by another firm found
78% of women voters in favor of
a ban.

President Clinton vetoed the
bill, claiming that the procedure is
only used in cases where the baby’
poses a severe threat to the health

of the mother. Yet Dr. Martin‘

Haskell, who has performed over"
1,000 partial-birth abortions,J.old_
the American Medical News in a
taped interview that of those abor-
tions, “80% are purely elective.”

Pro-abortion groups also
claimed that the anesthesia kills
the baby or at least prevents any
pain. But this drew a rebuttal from
both the American Society of An-
esthesiologists and the Society for
Obstetric Anesthesia and
Perinatology. These groups at-
tacked the claim as irresponsible
and asserted that anesthesia does
not even affect the baby in most
cases.

Clinton’s veto also provoked
an unprecedented letter of con-

demnation from all 8 cardinals of
the American Catholic church, who
labeled the practice infanticide, and
even the President’s ambassador
to the Vatican sided with the Catho-
lic Church’s position.

This issue will not die. But con-
trary to what the liberal media
would have you believe, the Re-
publican Party need not fear the
issue or the platform plank.

Abortion has proven to be a
winning issue for Republicans. In

 . . the
Republican
I-Party. need} .
not fear the"
6 issue or the
platform
plank. ”

the 1994 congressional elections,
not a single pro-life incumbent,
Republicanor Democratic, lost to
a pro-choice opponent in the gen-
eral election — the most under
reported story of the election.
According to exit polls from
several of the most recent elec-
tions, the GOP’s pro-life stance
consistently gives a net gain among
voters for whom abortion is the

)1

deciding factor. Finally, as Repub-
lican primaries across the country
demonstrate, most recently in the
Illinois govemor’s race, pro-life
voters represent a clear majority of
the Republican Party.

Unlike the Democrats, Repub-
licans have allowed debate on the

issue. While the Democrats denied 3

pro-life Democratic Governor Bob
Casey of Pennsylvania a chance to
even speak at their 1992 conven-

tion, the Republicans’ supposedly M

“hate-filled” convention featured
several prominent pro-choice

speakers.

And in what may be one of the

most ironic stories of 1996, pro- ‘I
‘life‘Democrats are mounting their
' own ‘challenge toitheir 'party”s' ex-

treme pro-choice platform ‘plank.
The congressional newspaper The
Hill reported last week that the K
approximately 40 pro-life congres-
sional Democrats (a number
roughly equal to that of pro-choice
Republicans) intend to try to pro- %
voke a debate over the issue at their
convention, although they hold
little hope of success.

Abortion promises to remain a
contentious issue throughout the x
campaign and one of the most stark
differences between the two par-
ties. For the moral future of the
nation and the political future of
their party, Republicans must have "
the courage to make the difficult
choice for life.

How bad could flying be’?

s students of a university
that has a large geo-
graphic draw, most W&L

students are no strangers to airline
ﬂying. Though I dislike airplanes,
the trade-off between a three hour
ﬂight and a full day in the car is not
much of a choice in my mind.

W&L students also have more
than their share of airplane stories
(at least those who have ﬂown with
me)! Part of this is because our
“home” airport here in Roanoke
will close if someone sneezes on
the runway. Recently, I have had
several experiences that I thought
were had until last weekend, when
the unthinkable happened — an
airplane crashed into the Florida
Everglades, about 30 miles from
my home, killing all 109 people on
board.

I remember ﬂying home on a
recent break and thinking I had it
bad. My trip from Roanoke Inter-
national to the Palm Beach Intema-
tional Airport seemed like an eter-
nity. Taking off from Roanoke at

48am, the plane was packed with

W&L students (as well as the
Elrods). The first leg of the journey
was ratheruneventful, and the land-
ing in Charlotte proved to be the
most interesting part of the ﬂight.

In Charlotte there were several
hours of delays, irate professional
football players yelling at ticket
agents (Rod Woodson), and a
TCBY employee of questionable
sexual preference, causing my fel-
low travelers and me to keep going
back for napkins and spoons just to
get a better look. I finally got on
the plane to my beloved South
Florida, but my stay in Charlotte
left a bitter taste in my mouth.
Later I found out that the plane was
being held up because of mainte-
nance problems, then delayed due
to the weather. I am glad they
found the problem in hindsight.

The trip to West Palm Beach
was also doomed; everything that
I thought could go wrong did.
NASA launched a rocket, causing
our plane to take a slight detour

' over the Gulf of Mexico, several

hundred miles out of the way.
There was a severe thunderstorm,
and the worst turbulence I have
ever experienced. At one point, an
overhead compartment popped
open, spilling the contents all over
the airplne. We landed neverthe-
less, safely, from the west, and
over the Everglades. I swore that
airplanes were not for me.
During Spring Break I went to
Japan with the Wind Ensemble.
Unfortunately for me, there is vir-
tually no way to get around ﬂying.
The highlight (or lowlight) of this
trip, the 14 hour plane ride from
Chicago to Seoul, Korea, was a

personal nightmare. First because
I had to be on a plane that long,
confined in a small space with hun-
dreds of people, and second be-
cause we ﬂew Korean Air, which
is not known for their impeccable
safety record.

This safety record, or lack
thereof, was a constant source of
amusement to my Japanese host
families, who made graphic hand
gestures and crashing noises. The
Buddhist priest I stayed with told
me he would pray for us on Sun-
day. On several of the landings,
both there and back, the 747s skid-
ded all over the runway — causing
the passengers to think the stew-
ardesses were getting some ﬂight
time in. That will be the last plane
trip I take for a while.

My father told me, “As long as
your number of take-offs equals
your number of landings, you
shouldn’t complain.” I look back
and realize that nothing was as bad
as it seemed. I landed, no matter
how tough it may have been.

The passengers of Valu.let ﬂight
592 were not so lucky.

I know many W&L students
that complain about the costs of
ﬂying home on breaks (I think my
parents are at the top of that list).
Every once in awhile, these planes
come down to Earth in the wrong
ways, reinforcing many people’s
beliefs that the extra cost is worth
the extra safety. I am in no way
accusing the budget airlines-we all

know of major airlines’ problems -
USAir, Delta, American, United.

President Clinton has been push-
ing for lower fares, and reportedly
giving special regulatory breaks to ,1-
start-up airlines like Valulet, in an
attempt to create more competi-
tion, and hence, lower fares. The
Transportation Department is start- ,
ing an investigation into the Fed)
eral Aviation Administration and
whether the Clinton administra-
tion has put too much pressure on
them to certify new airlines. The I
Valu.let crash, as of Wednesday
night, is thought to have occurred
because of hazardous materials
underneath the plane, something
ValuJet was not certified to carry.»-

Was this because of an inspec-
tion oversight? Possibly because
of lax regulations? Lax regula-
tions to cut costs and make airline
travel available to everyone? I‘
will gladly pay the costs of the
market dominated by a few air-
lines. These other airlines cut into
the major airlines and will eventu- X
ally cause them to cut costs also.
To me, the extra safety is worth
the extra money.

This tragedy could have hap-

pened to any of the W&L students 1
who routinely ﬂy home. For those

students, and especially for the
families of the 109 people aboard
ﬂight 592, I hope that there is not
some desk jockey in Washington
second guessing himself, or cov-
ering up something, tonight.

WILD NIGHTS

 

BY DAN ODENWALD
AND
SECRET AGENT WOMAN

As graduation rapidly approaches,
you won’t ﬁnd seniors in the computer
labs working on their theses. You
won’t ﬁnd them in the Career Develop-
ment and Placement Ofﬁce desper-
ately trying to land a job. And you
certainly won’t ﬁnd them at fraternity
parties (four years is quite enough of
that, thank you).

So where are on earth is the Class of
1996?That’s right, you guessed it —
The Palms. The place where everyone

knows your name. The place where all
the people go. The place where, if you
squint your eyes tightly enough, the
bartender looks like Woody Harrelson.

The Palms has long ago joined the
pantheon of Washington and Lee tradi-
tions. It ranks up there with the Honor
System, fraternities, academic excel-
lence, and even our beloved 99—year-
old Ring-tum Phi. So what is it about
the Palms that is so enchanting? What
draws countless W&L students to its
doors on warm spring nights? What is
the Palms mystique?

What follows are the opinions of
two W&L undergraduates. First, the
naive neophyte. He turned 21 only
four months ago. Lured to Lexington’s
most famous bar by the legendary drink

specials, he desperately attempts to
carve his own Palms niche.

Second, we have the jaded veteran.
She is bright, cheerful, and has used
her sultry Southern accent to win more
than her fair share of free drinks. She’s
been frequenting the bar for over a year
now, knows every employee by name
and scent, and can capture the best
table on the most crowded of nights.
She is indeed the Grand Palms Diva.

Read on for two accounts of our
favorite watering hole. From green
eyes to eyes that have seen it all, we’ll
de-construct the Palms mystique for all
inquiring minds.‘ (Special apologies to
Journalism Professor Brian Richardson
who should advise his In-depth Writ-
ing students never to mix his teachings
with alcohol.)

The Neophyte

It’s Wednesday night and the
driving rain has kept away many
of the Palms’ mostfaithful. But
the die-hard fringe is here, as
always. The crowd is an odd

‘ mixture — recent VMI graduates . "
, dressed in civilian-clothesvrartduw
-arrned with diplomas still wet

with ink, a smattering of townies
who occasionally call up their
favorite countrysong on thejuke-
box, and W&L kids escaping the
dubious pressures of Spring
Term.

Top 40 hits come blaring out
of the speakers on the ceiling.
Alanis, Stone Temple Pilots, Ace
of Base, and Right Said Fred pro-
vide the melodic backdrop to this
scene. The bar smells of ciga-
rettes and spilled beer. I munch
on the much-too-salty popcorn,
each kernel dehydrating me ever
so slightly. (What a marketing
ploy! Obviously, the owner must
be a C-School graduate.)

I sit with three friends. We
pass the night by drinking pitch-
ers of Bud Lite and telling embar-
rassing sex stories. Parents walk-
ing in on you, moving furniture,
pasta — you know the sort...

But our talk isn’t all frivolous.
We talk about departed friends,

scorned minority groups, and tat-
toos.

I learn what it’s like to grow
up in Hilton Head where “there
are no rules.” I learn that talking

.ing basketballs aren’t always

bouncing basketballs.

But the conversation begins
to turn too steamy for my inno-
cent ears, and my eyes start to
wander.

Scanningthe hazy bar, I focus
on one girl — a friend from last
year. She’s a recent graduate
who never quite found her way
home after Alumni Weekend. It’s
rumored that she’s been here ev-
ery night since then. Her arms
are thrown about a law student’s
neck and the two drink and laugh,
drink and laugh, drink and laugh.

She spots me and beckons me
over with the come-hither mo-
tion of her index finger. I roll my
eyes.

Please don’t let her throw up
on me, I think.

“You look great,” I say as I
put my arms around her waist in
a friendly hug. She really does
look great. She’s lost about 20
pounds since I last saw her and

her hair has gotten lighter. Look-
ing very J. Crew in her blue skirt
and ribbed white sweater, 7 she
smiles widely. Her eyes are strik-
ingly blue, but clouded and blood-
shot. She§s been here a long
time. ‘

matter-of-factly.

I stand their with a puzzled
expression on my facegkindof
like when my grandmother told
me she had corns on her feet.
What was I supposed to say?
How wonderful? Your parents
must be so proud?

“For depression,” she quickly
adds. Well, I’m glad it’s not for
prostate trouble. Searching for
something to say, her tall red-
headed friend comes out of, no
where and grabs her by the arm
whisking her away to bigger and
better things, namely the law stu-
dent who has since moved down
the bar.

Somewhat irked, I wander
back to my table, desirous of
more stories and hops.

This is what the Palms is all
about, my friends. Bud Lite,
Prozacky alumnus, and good
talks. Odd, quirky, salty. It’ll
win you over every time.

It’s 12:40 am. I’ve settled
down in some of the szrase-green
wooden booths at the Palms. If

is, go back to Texas and sign up

tables. Kip, the ever famous bar-
tender smokes in the back corner
of the long, glazed wooden bar,
trying to hide from several
drunken regulars hungry to talk
to someone, anyone about their
day.Why do people come to the
Palms? The atmosphere? The
liquor? The good deals on Bud
Lite pitchers? No.

The bar is lined with every
kind of liquor you can pronounce
and even some you can’t. In
bourbon alone, the bar has six
types, ranging from the old-
standby, Jim Beam, to Old Grand
Dad, a far richer, cleaner sweet
blend.

Washington and Lee students,
VMI cadets, Mary Baldwin,
Sweet Briar, and Hollins girls-
they all come to here for the
people.

Where else can you ﬁnd a bar
manager who stands ﬁve feet tall

you ﬁnd a bartender with one

East Lex of the ABCstore._ If you
make friends with Kip, he may
serve you three bourbon and
cokes for $1.75.

Some nights are hard to miss
at the Palms. Four days before
the 1996 class graduated from
VMI, a sea of white cadet uni-
forms were seen in the Palms.
By one o’clock, some were ﬁnd-
ing it difficult to stand, while
others were balanced uneasily
upon their barstools. All of them
secretly wished for seatbelts to
hold them upright. One poor
celebrant went down the steep
staircase the hard way, while one
was locked in the bathroom for
an intense one-on-one counsel-
ing session with the porcelain
god. And then the real fun started.

A Lexington man in his mid-
twenties stumbled back to his
table from the bar and acciden-
tally knocked the hat off an un-

loved cap ﬂew off the guy’s head
and onto the beer-spattered, ciga-
rette-stained ﬂoor. The cadet
shot up out of his chair like a bat
out of hell.

but the words were drowned out
by a screaming rendition of
“Come to My Window” by Mel-
issa Etheridge. The cadet pushed
again and a scufﬂe started. The
wave of white shirts caved in on
the scene.

Donnie, the small but loud
bar manager, glanced up from
her romance novel hidden be-
hind her cashier’s dC:k. Seeing
the trouble, the usually petite,
friendly, woman grabbed her fa-
mous green bat and plunged into
the crowd. The white wave broke
as cadets ﬂed the area. The mi-
nor ﬁght broke quickly and si-
Iently. With her job done, Donnie
shouted, “Last call!”

Hands from every comer of
the bar shot into the air, trying to
get the attention of their faithful
server. The night would end on
the same note as it had begun —
free—ﬂowing alcohol, laughter,
and cheer.

Twister: Jurassic Park, but like, it doesn't suck

BY ALEX CHRISTENSEN
PHI MOVIE Cnrrrc

ﬁﬁﬁﬁ of4 stars; only
the stuffy would complain

The pitch: “It’ll be like
Jurassic Park meets
Speed!”

I did not go into Twister with unrea-
sonable expectations. I just wanted to
be entertained. Then the picture came
up on the screen, the wind blew me
back in my seat, and I embarked on the
greatest thrill-ride of a movie since
Speed or Natural Born Killers. Twister
is so real and powerful and, above all,
entertaining, that to complain that the
story is a little hokey or the characters
said clichéd lines is a fundamental mis-
understanding of the ﬁlm. It’s toma-
does, man!

Comparing Twister toJurassicPark
is very valid. Michael Crichton wrote
both ﬁlms, and they both feature “stars”
who were completely computer-gen-
erated. Steven Spielberg produced both
ﬁlms, as well. There was a lot which
disappointed me about Jurassic Park,
however. For one thing, all of the char-
acters were so annoying that I kept
wishing for them all to die. Also, and I
know this is a completely nonsensical
thing to say, but I just could not appre-
ciate the effects much at all. Sure, they

were impressive, but I mean, so is a
Van Gogh; I do not want to spend two
hours sitting in front of a movie screen
with a Van Gogh on it. There has to be
an emotional involvement and an ef-
fective visual use of effects to really
impress. For instance, I thought the
most effective use of effects inJurassic
Park was when the cow is lowered into
the cage and is ripped apart offscreen.
The noises were great. They conveyed
everything that needed to be conveyed.
Another good scene was when Wayne
Knight’s character, attempting to
smuggle DNAofftheisland,waskilled
by the poison-shooting dinosaur. I think
that was an animatronic dinosaur,
though. So why was I watching a
movie?

I could have been home on my
couch listening to the radio or watch-
ing “Muppets Tonight!” I wished I was
home on my couch listening to the
radio or watching “Muppets Tonight!”
Maybe tonight I will stay home on my
couch and listen to the radio or watch
“Muppets Tonight!”

Or maybe I will go see Twister
again. Because, brother, does Jan de
Bont, the director who brought us
Speed, and the cinematographer who
brought us Cujo, Die Hard, and The
Hunt for Red October, know how to
make a movie that is both exciting,
gripping, and roundhouse-punch scary.
When I saw Speed for the ﬁrst time, I
was actually dodging and jumping in
my seat and swearing out loud. (This
can be very annoying to those seated

around you. Be forewarned. Twister is
such a panic-inducing movie.)

Jack N. Green, Twister’s cinema-
tographer and Clint Eastwood’s for the
gorgeous Unforgiven and Bridges of
Madison County, pulls off some truly
amazing helicopter shots and shots that
require expert timing. He also photo-
graphs nature with such an unerring
eye that you see the movie as a land-
scape of plains which intersects in an
eerily beautiful way with the deadly
power of nature as manifested by the
tornadoes. You always feel that what is
happening on screen is moving toward
you, like your feet are on the ground
with the characters, as well.

I guess I will give a brief plot sum-
mary. The plot does not really matter.
The plot is just an excuse for a bunch of
tornadoes and destruction. This is a
good thing. I do not want to be bothered
with emotional baggage or following
the intricacies of some loser’s
backstory. I want to see something get
knocked over. De Bont comes through
for me.

So anyway, there are these storm-
chasers, see, they want to ﬁnd out how
a tornado works, because nobody re-
ally knows, so they design “Dorothy” a
machine that enters the eye of a tor-
nado (they have to place it the tomado’s
path, of course) and releases hundreds
of tiny sensors, which then record and
transmit detailed information back to
the scientists’ computers. Bill (Bill
Paxton) designed Dorothy, but he has
left the project, and his wife Jo (Helen

Hunt) for a new job as a weatherman
and a new life with his ﬁancée, Melissa
(Jami Gertz). Of course, on a trek out to
get Jo to sign the divorce papers, Bill
gets sucked back in with the old crew.
Yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah.
Then there is this evil corporate storm-
chaser, Jonas (Cary Elwes), who has
stolen the design of Dorothy and is
looking to get his ﬁndings completed
before the other group. A rare storm
configuration has presented some
unique opportunities for study, so the
race is on between the two groups to
place and operate their machine ﬁrst.
Sound stupid? It is. Don’t think about
it too much.

Unlike inJurassicPark, dc Bont has
the good sense to treat the human char-
acters like what they are: bit players.
There is almost no manipulative crap
to try and get you to care while you are
just waiting for the next cool effect.

Who can think anyway with a big
tornado barreling toward you, swirling
and roiling with debris and dust and
who knows? hellﬁre and a kind of cruel
intelligent mindlessness that Spielberg
wishes his dippy Velociraptors had had
for one second? Who needs to? Prob-
ably some idiot movie critic.

But if you are looking for a movie
that is a movie in every full, complete
sense of the word, the kind of movie
you can watch with popcorn on Satur-
day afternoon, Twister is it. It is a four-
star action picture, a four-star disaster
picture, and that adds up to a four-star
picture.

F G&L speaker, from page 1

sexuals at W&L. He stated that “gays
and lesbians need an environment in
which they can come out,” and while
White does not feel that the Washing-
ton and Lee community is hostile to-
ward homosexuals, he also maintains
that it is not “entirely supportive.”
White sees education, concerning ho-
mosexuals and homosexual issues, as
the most pressing need on campus, but
admits that the process will take time.
White stated that his purpose was “to
talk about what we should do before
having a Coming Out Day,” as he did
not feel that W&L was prepared for
such an event at this time.

Rev. Steen, a 1966 graduate of
Washington and Lee, was the
evening’s keynote speaker. Steen is
an Episcopal minister based in Wash-
ington, D.C. who considers his sexu-
ality “a great gift.” He stated that he
was delighted to speak on a subject he
feels so strongly about, particularly
due to his history at W&L. The fact
that he was invited to speak on gay
issues in Lee Chapel was itself an
indication to Steen that “change is
taking place.”

Like White, Steen stressed the im-
portance of education, and he believes
“there is no substitute for knowing
someone who is lesbian or gay” for
getting rid of old prejudices. At a
reception following the event, Dean
of Students David Howison agreed
that “understanding differences” was
a key factor in overcoming prejudices.
Sophomore Milagros Daly, who at-
tended the program, concurred. “This

    
  
  
  
  

school needs to be more tolerant. I
would like to see some change,” Daly
stated. ,

In resolving cases of race, gender,
or economic differences, Steen said
“all the same dynamics apply,” but
resolving differences in sexual orien-
tation presents an additional hurdle.
People say that gays are “immoral”
and call their behavior “sick and un-
natural,” and for this reason dealing
with homophobia is all the more difﬁ-
cult according to Steen.

Steen stated that “unless gays are
willing to stand up and talk,” nothing
will happen to change attitudes to-
ward them. He hoped, by speaking at
W&L, to “effect change,” a desire
obvious even during his undergradu-
ate years at W&L. Steen was one of
the ﬁrst members of Contact, and he
was also involved in the effort to end
segregation.

The latter was “the big social is-
sue” during his time in Lexington, and
segregation ended the year of his
graduation. Steen also stated that he
came to address the crowd in Lee
Chapel to honor the memory of a de-
ceased friend and others like him, who
lived or continue to live “lives of quiet
desperation” and who fear discovery
of their homosexuality.

Rev. Steen has no memory of
discussion of gay issues at Washing-
ton and Lee, or in society, during the
1960’s, although he estimates that three
to four thousand gays and lesbians
have graduated from W&L over the
years. He stated that there was “no
awareness among gay students” that
there were other homosexuals on cam-
pus. Most of these people, Steen be-

lieves, hid their sexual preferences in
an effort to ﬁt in, and he attributes the
“confusion” he experienced for years
to “repressive atmospheres.” A re-
pressive environment, in his opinion,
“forces people into relationships that
aren’t good for anyone.”

After the dissolution of his mar-
riage, Steen slowly became “more
honest” with himself, and he eventu-
ally came out to members of his par-
ish. Steen compared the church’s re-
action to the military’s “don’t ask -
don’t tell” policy, but stated that he
was proud, not ashamed, to reveal his
homosexuality. Therefore he was not
upset to be “outed” ﬁve years ago on
the front page of the Washington Post,
but rather found the experience “won-
derfully freeing.” He jokingly com-
mented that, after that incident, he
never had to “come out” to anyone
again.

Steen’s current work involves re-
solving differences within congrega-
tions resulting from differences in race,
gender, economic and social back-
grounds, and sexual orientation. He
credits his fascination with diversity
as the basis for his work, and says that
he has always sought to “build diverse
congregations.” He also believes that
his work is in keeping with the current
desire to reinforce “family values.”

Steen said that he cannot under-
stand how suppression of homosexu-
ality can be healthy and promote a
positive family unit, and he believes
an open, supportive environment is
beneﬁcial for everyone. Heconcluded
with a wish for the future at W&L, that
homosexuals will learn to be proud of
their sexuality, and that heterosexuals

Stadium. And when the teams is los-
ing? Forget it. You could start a
bonﬁre in the stands and nobody would
notice.

As for the players, let’s run down
the lineup. First, Mark Grudzielanek.
Phillies broadcaster Rich Ashbum re-
ferred to him as “Mark Grudzalansky”
several weeks ago, so obviously Mark
has a rep. If he keeps hitting .360,
Grudzielanek will become a house-
hold name. Next, there is Mike Lan-
sing, someone formerly better known
as having the same name as the capital
of Michigan. Well, he’s hitting .323. A
Sense a pattern here?

Batting third is Henry Rodriguez.
Henry was a reserve outﬁelder for the
Dodgers last year. This year, he has
hit 15 homers already and is batting
.343. This is the stuff legends are
made of. He is so popularthat Montreal
fans caused a candy bar delay on Sun-
day by littering the ﬁeld with candy
bars named after Rodriguez. How
things can change in one year!

After that comes Moises Alou, the
lone superstar in the Expos lineup.
And he is “only” hitting .277. Come
on Moises, get with the program. Alou
is followed by David Segui, a guy
who had been mired on the Mets’
bench of all places. What’s David up
to in Montreal? Hitting at atorrid .341
pace, that’s what.

F.P. Santangelo hits sixth. Sounds
more like an investment ﬁrm or some-
thing. But face it, one day you’ll be
sitting with your grandchildren on your
lap telling them story after story about
back in the day when you watched the
legendary F.P. Santangelo whack the
ball a country mile. If he keeps hitting
.310, they’ll want to hear more.

Bringing up the rear of the lineup is
catcher Darren Fletcher, humming
along at .306, and power-hitting third
baseman Shane Andrews. The team
as a whole is hitting .287 and leads the
National League in runs scored. And
this is all without future star Rondell
White, who is currently on the dis-
abled list.

The pitching staff is led by Fassero,
who has spent the last two years as
trade bait, and Pedro Martinez, better
known for constantly plunking bat-
ters in the past. The starting staff is
currently without Busta Rhymes pro-
tege Carlos Perez, who is also on the
DL. The veteran bullpen has held
together very well and closer Rojas
features one of the best forkballs in the

league.

If the Expos keep up this current
pace, manager Felipe Alou will need
to win more than Manager of the Year;
he should be martyred. No manager;
has done more with'less. Despite a,
team that resembles a Triple-A roster
and management that has traded away

or dumped Marquis Grissom, Delino ’

DeShields, Larry Walker, Tony:
Tarasco, Wil Cordero, Tim Wallach,1
Dennis Martinez and John Wettelanci
in recent years, Alou has the Expos?
perched atop the NL East with a 27-13:
record. No matter what he has, the"
man keeps winning. And he even
goes about it in a gentlemanly fash-
ion, not someone who gets in people’s
faces and cusses them out. You have
to feel good for a person like that.
Do I think Montreal will maintain
its pace and ﬁnish ahead of the de-
fending champion Atlanta Braves?
No. The Braves are notoriously slow
starters but are way too talented for
anyone to beat them over 162 games.
In fact, the Expos could ﬁnish any-
where in the division depending on
whether the Phillies and Marlins can
find some offense and the Mets can
find some heart. —
But for now, the beat goes on in
Montreal and Alou will hope that:
Grudzalansky and Friends stay red-
hot. If they do, maybe Felipe will get
a candy bar named after him too.

Shapard also competed in the

Women’s tennis places second at NCAA national tournament

The women's tennis team competed in the NCAA
Division III National Tournament last week. De-
spite a well played contest, the Generals succumbed
to Emory in the championship match by a score
of 5 to 1.

BY BETHANY BAUMAN
PHI SPORTS EDITOR

The women’s tennis
team made their final
appearence of the season last
week at the NCAA Division III
Championships in Kalamazoo,
Michigan.

On May 7th, the 16-0 Gener-
als faced Sewanee in the ﬁrst
round, and cruised to an easy 5-
0 victory. The highlight of this
match came when Natalia
Garcia, playing at No. 1 singles,
defeated Kristen Ialacci, 6-0, 6-
0. Ialacci was the only player to
defeat Garcia in a dual match
during the regular season.

Washington and Lee met
Pomona-Pitzer for the second
round of competition. After
struggling through doubles play,

losing two of three matches, the
Generals rebounded with four
singles victories.

With the 5-2 win, the women
advanced to the semi—ﬁnals. Here
the Generals faced off against
second-seeded Trinity Univer-
sity of San Antonio, Texas.

Helen Chandler said, “Going
into nationals we had already
played many of the top teams
from the different regions. It
gave us the confidence that it
was entirely possible for us to
win the tournament.”

TheW&Lsquadplayedsome
of their best tennis of the tourna-
ment to pull off the 5-2 upset.
The Generals had an early lead
after the tandem of Garcia and
Julie Ayers trounced Trinity’s
Laura Brady and Vanessa Hill at
No. 1 doubles. Chandler and
Shelley Sunderman also posted

an 8-6 win at No. 3 doubles over
Christy Wussow and Sara
Feuler.

The Generals then made a
strong showing in singles play
against Trinity, with Garcia and
Ericka Shapard pulling in victo-
ries at the No. 1 and No.2 spots.

But perhaps the most memo-
rable match of the afternoon was
Berry Blankinship’s perfor-
mance. Playing at No. 3 singles,
she lost the first set 0-6 to
Trinity’s Lola Taylor. But
Blankinship came back to take
the match with 6-4, 7-6 second
and third set victories.

Last Friday, the women ’s ten-
nis team stood one step away
from a national title. But a tal-
ented 20-3 team from Emory
University was also in the hunt
for its first NCAA Division III
women’s tennis championship.

The Generals had a rough
start, losing two of three doubles
matches. Only the team of
Garcia and Ayers was able to
best Emory’s Amy Smith and
Megan Bern, 8-6. After the
doubles competition, the con-
test was moved from Stowe Sta-
dium to the Markin Raquet Cen-
ter due to rain.

Emory continued to display
theirwinningwaysinthesingles
competition. Jessica Levy
bested Shapard 6-1, 6-2.
Blankinship dropped her match
to Adrian Poole, 6-1, 7-5, and
Ayers lost to Megan Bern, 6-0,
6-2. Garcia, Sunderman, and
Chandler’s matches were not
completed.

While Emory may have taken
home the title after the 5-1 vic-
tory, the Generals left the tour-
nament satisﬁed.

Shapard said, “Our team
came together so well and every
single player rose to the
occassion. Each of us played
better this week than we have all

.season-maybe even ever.”

Sunderman added, “Every
match we played at nationals
was not won by one player or
another, but every person on the
team pulled through to get us to
the ﬁnals. If one person was
having a bad day, another would
step up and win her match...I
could not have asked for a better
senior gift!”

In the individual competition
of the nationals, Garcia and
Ayers were upset in the ﬁrst
round by Kenyon’s top-ranked
pair. Garcia continued on to the
singles competition, reaching the

]'_em1i§: A unanimous choice out of
probably the toughest ﬁeld of competitors,
Natalia Garcia. The sophomore led the
Generals to another ODAC championship
and appearence at the national touma-
ment. In the regular season, Garcia com-
piled a 10-1 singles record and a 12-1
doubles record in tandem with Julie Ayers.
Garcia was last year’s ITA Rookie of the
Year and will continue to be the Generals’
number one player next year.

§oc§e[: Michelle Bauman ﬁnished this
season tied for the team lead in goals with
14, second on the team in assists with 6 and
second in total points with 34. Bauman
scored the Generals’ game winning goal in
four contests. Bauman’s leadership of a
fairly young team allowed the Generals to
extend past any growing pains and leap
right into their conference schedule and
eventually place into the second-round of
ODACs.

lragkz Josephine Schaeffer played a

 

her standards of excellence by leading the
Generals to an outstanding ﬁnish this sea-
son. Her efforts resulted in a place at the
national competition and several key per-
formances for the Generals in individual
and team competition. Prince has been a
standout swimmer for her entire collegiate
career and her leadership by example has
motivated more swimmers to strive for her
continuing levels of excellence.

   

tremendous role on the Generals track team,
posting several outstanding ﬁnishes this
season. Schaeffer carried her performances
from cross—country over to the track and
maintained her place as the Generals’ top
distance runner. Her graduation will leave
a void in the team that will be very difﬁcult
to ﬁll for her teammates. Again, another
unanimous selection for Josephine
Schaeffer.

  

gmssgz Erika Snyder ﬁnished this
season as the leading scorer and led the
Generals’ lacrosse team to a berth in the
ODAC Tournament. Snyder tallied 62
total points including team-highs of 33
goals and 29 assists. Snyder’s leadership
and outstanding point production led the
Generals to a 9-5 record including a 6-1
ODAC record. Only a junior, Snyder will
return to Lexington next year to be the top
offensive threat for the Generals.

V91 leybal I: In the wake of the Generals’
ﬁrst ODACchampionship, Cheryl Taurassi
and became the Washington and Lee all-
time assist leader in the process. Battling
several injuries this year, Taurassi used
immeasurable toughness to propel her team
to the conference title. Taurassi averaged
7.5 assists per game and totaled 527 assists
for the season. Taurassi played the key role
and allowed her teammates to feed off her
intensity and excellent play.

 : The favorite of Gener-

als cross-country, Josephine Schaeffer.
Again she attained All-American honors
and remainedW&L’s top runner. Placing
ﬁrst at several ODAC and non-conference
events, Schaeffer has led her team for four
years and is one of the top runners in the
nation. Schaeffer again took honors as
ODAC Runner of the Year and has left her
mark on the ODAC and Washington and
Lee record books for many years to come.

 

 : Sandra Holmes

just finished her senior season and out-
standing career as the Generals’ ﬂoor
leader. She averaged 11.4 points and 9.2
boards per game, while logging the most
minutes played and placing second in steals.
Holmes superb leadership helped this Gen-
erals team initiate young talent into tough
ODAC league play and helped lay the
foundation for years to come in Generals’
basketball.
