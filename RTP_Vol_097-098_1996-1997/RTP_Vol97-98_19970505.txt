WASHINGTON & LEE UNIVERSITY

After years of upperclass sorority
women and freshman women tip-toe-
ing around constricting rush regula-
tions, the Panhellenic Council has re-
laxed the rules. Previous rules en-
tailed closed contact between upper-
classmen and freshmen, but the 1997-
98 year brings open contact and a
promise of a more comfortable rush.

“The girls who are the happiest af-
ter rush are the women who knew and
had friendships with upperclassmen
girls throughout the year,” Panhellenic
Judicial Vice President Sara McCrone
said. “The purpose of having open
contact is so that the girls can make
an informed decision about the soror-
ity they choose.”

In times of closed contact. upper-

classmen and freshmen could not so-
cialize together in the
upperclassmen’s residence, study to-
gether in a place other than the library
or eat meals together.

Open contact encourages upper-
classmen and freshmen to form rela-
tionships with each other by engag-
ing in those activities that were once
taboo.

“I think that this will make the pre-
rush period and actual rush less awk-
ward. People will be able to make
lasting friendships that will last be-
yond rush without being nervous
about breaking the rules.”

Panhellenic stresses that freshman
women cannot attend a sorority
woman’s party involving alcohol. “If
freshman women show up at such a
party, the sorority women who live
there should approach them and ask

“Beginning in spring 1997, (Wash-
ington and Lee) students will be re-
quired to register for classes online.”

What?

Don’t worry. This comment, along
with several others, was printed erro-
neously in the May 1997 issue of Ya-
hoof Internet Life. The online maga-
zine wrote an article on what it
deemed to be “America’s 100 Most
Wired Colleges.” W&L ranked 37th
in the ratings. However, according

to Science Librarian Hugh Blackmer,
the rating does not mean much.

A representative from Yahoo!
magazine called Blackmer and in an
informal interview asked him for in-
formation he could not provide with
100% accuracy.

“I pulled numbers out of the air,”
said Blackmer. “But they were as
good of an estimate as anyone can
make.”

Some of the estimates made by
Blackmer include percentages for the
number of student-owned computers,
classes with webpages and students

them to leave.”

Panhellenic rules also prohibit so-
rority women from buying anything,
especially alcohol, for freshman
women, McCrone said. “This would
include paying for a meal,” McCrone
said.

Above all, the new rules promise
less stress for freshman women about
what they can and cannot do. “I just
don’t want the freshman girls to feel
any pressure anymore about breaking
rules,” McCrone said. “The rules are
a little vague and have a lot of lee
way.”

clude overtures toward a less materi-
alistic rush by cutting the budgets for

The one estimate printed by Ya-
hoo! with which Blackmer did not
agree was for classes with online
homework. Yahoo.’ printed it as 45%.
Blackmer thought is was high, but
then said he could not be sure.

“If they took into account the stu-
dents’ ability to communicate with
their professors about homework
through e-mail, then it could be 45%,”
said Blackmer.

Tragic accident
takes W&L
freshman’s life

BY K/\'l‘llRYN l\/l/\YURNlK &

THE RING- TUM PM

It was a message no one will
ever forget.
Every campus phone received

a message Saturday morning’

from Director of Communica-
tions Brian Shaw stating that
freshman John Joseph “Jack”
Bowden died Saturday from se-
vere head trauma.
Bowden allegedly fell
from his second ﬂoor
Gilliam Dormitory win-
dow Friday at9:38 p.m.
Sophomores Rebecca
Makkai and Katie Hinz
were on their way back
from aperformance at
Lee Chapel when
they found Bowden
in his boxer shorts
on the sidewalk be-
tween Gilliam and
the Overnight Guest house.
While Makkai stayed with
Bowden, Hinz ran to the inﬁr-
mary where the nurse called se-
curity and 911.

“At first I thought that he had
been shot,” Makkai said. “There
was blood all the way down to
the street.”

“When we got there, he
seemed frightened. Once we
began to take care of him, he
seemed to calm down . . . It was
almost like he went to sleep.”

She talked to Bowden, while
rubbing his arm, even though he
was unconscious. “I didn’t know
if he could hear me,” Makkai
said. “I told him not to move or
say anything, to keep breathing
and that he was going to be OK.”

Security and the paramedics
arrived within four to five min-
utes.

“It appears he fell out of the
second floor window and struck
his head on the sidewalk,” Direc-
tor of Security Mike Young said
yesterday. He would not specu-
late on the cause ofthe fall. “It’s
really a mystery. I can’t specu-
late, but it appears it was an ac-
cident.” Young said.

Paramedics took Bowden to
Stonewall Jackson Hospital
where he was stabilized and
then airlifted to Roanoke Me-
morial Hospital shortly after
midnight. He was admitted to

 

Bowden

the Neurotrauma Unit at 1:05 a.m.
Saturday morning. He was pro-
nounced brain dead early that morn-
ing due to severe head injuries.

Dean of Students David Howison
called Bowden’s parents from
Stonewall Jackson. Dr. Jane Horton
was on duty at the hospital and also
spoke with Bowden’s parents.
Howison then drove to Roanoke
Memorial.

Dr. and Mrs. Roger Bowden drove
from their home in
Darien, Conn. and ar-
rived in Roanoke at 8
a.m. Saturday and met
with Howison. After
consulting doctors, his
parents discontinued life
support and made the
decision to donate his or-

gans.
The university and
Lexington Police

Department’s investiga-
tions are still outstanding,
and no information has been released
yet. The officer on duty Friday night
Sergeant E.W. Straub had no com-
ment. ‘

Young asks that anyone with any
information about Bowden’s acci-
dent contact security or the police
immediately.

Bowden graduated from Darien
High School. At W&L, he was a
member of Beta Theta Phi fraternity
and an avid tennis player. Howison
stated that Bowden’s parents repeated
how much he loved W&L.

“He wasjust one ofthose guys that
got along with everyone on the hall,”
Gilliam 208 resident Brian Prisco
said. “You didn’t have to know him
really well to know he was a nice
guy.”

“He had a really happy personal-
ity,” hallmate Steven Straub said.
“This has been a really tough week-
end because a lot ofthe guys on the
hall were good friends with him.”

The university’s counselor Dean
Schroer-Lamont and the peer coun-
selors are available for any students
who need support. The Dorm Coun-
selors had a meeting with Schroer-
Lamont, Horton, and Dr. James
Worth also.

As of our press time, there have
not yet been funeral or memorial ser-
vices scheduled.

The Federal Campus
Security Act

After their daughter was raped and
murdered by a student who broke into
her Lehigh University donn room,
Howard and Connie Clery became the
driving force behind the enactment of
a federal campus security law.

The Campus Security Act was en-
acted in 1990 and requires colleges and
universities to annually publish their
crime statistics.

According to Security On Campus
Inc., an advocacy group started by the
Clerys, administrators at some schools
have circumvented the reporting re-
quirements for somecrimes by chan-
neling them into conﬁdential disciplin-
ary committees which are protected by
the Family Educational Rights and Pri-
vacy Act. The S.O.C. website, says
many schools are “hiding incidents
ﬁom law enforcement” and then us-
ing FERPA to “shield these records
from public view even when they are
the only adjudication of allegations of
felonious misconduct.”

In attempt to clarify procedures
outlined in the earlier act, Congress is
currently debating the Accuracy in
Campus Crime Reporting Act of 1997.
It would increase reported crime cat-
egories, open campus police logs, end
conﬁdentiality for students accused of
criminal activity and open the secret
on-campus disciplinary proceedings
where students accused of criminal
misconduct are oﬁen diverted.

Women’s Forum sponsors
campus security discussion

BY TARAH GRANT
PHI FEATURES EDITOR

Washington and Lee’s following
of the Campus Security Act was ques-
tioned at the Women’s Forum panel
discussion about campus security last
Thursday in the University Center.
The Campus Security Act deals with
reporting crimes against women.

“It is important to educate students
and raise awareness on issues that im-
pact students emotionally,” Women’s
Forum Advisor and Associate Dean
Anne Schroer-Lamont said. “Since
the undergraduate school had never
done an awareness program from the
legal standpoint, (forum leaders and
their Board of Advisors) decided to
sponsor one this year.”

Women’s Forum invited Attorney
Elizabeth Griffin ‘9l, who is em-
ployed by the Council ofHigher Edu-
cation of Virginia, Director of Secu-
rity Mike Young, Attorney and W&L
Law School Professor Joan
Shaughnessy and Dean David
Howison to the discussion.
Shaughnessy was the moderator of
the discussion.

Howison, who is “charged with the
responsibility ofenforcing (the Cam-
pus Security Act),” according to
Schroer-Lamont, was unable to attend

Weekend activity.

In their opening statements, the
invitees spoke on their areas of ex-
pertise. Griffin explained the Cam-
pus Security Act, which requires col-
leges and universities to publish their
crime statistics. Young emphasized
that security’s role is to make sure stu-
dents are safe. “We feel we are in
compliance with (the act),” Young
said. “We are doing as much as is
required and more.”

Students can take pride in know-
ing that W&L is a place one can feel
comfortable walking from the library
at 2 a.m., Young said.

He noted the two primary im-
provements in campus security since
he came in 1991: the installation of
the card access system and the devel-
opment and implementation ofa self
defense course for women. Young
also told audience members to note
the location ofsecurity call boxes on
campus and that if a student ever feels
uncomfortable about walking some-
place, and call security for a ride.

“We want to do everything pos-
sible to make sure it is safe and take
care ofyou, and in return we only ask
that you try to take care of yourself,
be aware, use common sense,”Young
said. “lt’s not in your best interest to

go out and get drunk because bad
things can happen to you.”

During the following question ses-
sion, Schroer—Lamont turned the con-
versation to what the university is not
doing, including informing students
ofdangerous situations, reporting ac-
curate statistics and clarifying report-
ing procedures.

A big concern at other campuses
is the use of the Rohyponol
(“Rophies”), a drug that causes
unconsiousness and amnesia and is
referred to as the “date rape”drug.
When a student audience member
asked about the use of Rohypnol on
campus, Young responded, “I can’t
say it hasn’t happened, it just hasn’t
been reported to us that we can con-
finn.”

Schroer-Lamont interjected that
the use of Rohyponol has been re-
ported to the Student Health Ser-
vices. “And Dr. Horton (the Uni-
versity Medical Director) has worked
with several patients who she feels
very likely were victims of, perhaps
not Rohyponol, but of some foreign
agent put into a drink where a person
went completely limp after having a
half glass of wine or half a beer,”
Schroer-Lamont said.

She explained that in the four
years that the university did sexual

assault surveys, “the same two fra-
ternities were named again and again
by women reporting they had taken
a drink at a party and had experienced
a very quick reaction of their legs
turning rubbery and passing out. 
There is a good chance that in past
years, even prior to Rohyponol, that
there were a couple of groups on
campus that did know of some agent
and few members may have used it
and a few of our female students may
have ingested it.”

Schroer-Lamont then mentioned
that the university has allegedly al-
tered crime statistics. She read from
the 1995 Report on Campus Crime
and Campus Security, which reported
no rapes for four years, 1991-95.

To Schroer-Lamont’s statement
Young said, “It can’t be.”

“Well it is, my eyes say,” Schroer-
Lamont replied. “It was interesting
when we looked at the earlier reports
and looked at the later ones, we saw
we had changed our numbers.”

According to Schroer-Lamont,
there is a discrepancy between sta-
tistics in the early federal reports that
went out to The Chronicle of Higher
Education and the ones that were
published the following year. Since
each report covers a span of four
years, “We have not been consistent,”
she said.

Schroer-Lamont also believes that

the university does not clearly explain
to students the procedures for report-
ing a crime so that it will be included
in the crime statistics. While Young,
who works with Howison in compil-
ing crime statistics, emphasized that
Security should be contacted in
sexual misconduct cases, the Student
Handbook says students should report
sexual misconduct to Dean Anece
McCloud.

Dean McCloud’s ofﬁce publishes
an annual report with numbers con-
cerning date rapes, rapes, sexual as-
saults and harassment that are “sub-
stantially larger” than those published
by Howison’s office. Schroer-
Lamont thinks students need to be
better informed of who they should
report cases to. “I don’t think there
is anywhere in the literature that says
students can report it to Mr. Young
or any of his staff members that work
in Security,” she said.

“It’s pretty common sense,”
Young responded. “You call me if
your wallet gets stolen, why wouldn’t
you call me for any other crime?”

Young said McCloud doesn’t
share information from her counsel-
ing sessions with him and that the
numbers reported in the crime statis-
tics are continued cases only where
an investigation has taken place.

“I just want to make it clear to
the students that if they have a

 

friend who has been assaulted, to
come by (Security) and go to Dean
McCloud and to talk to the Com-
monwealth Attorney and/or a police
officer,” Schroer-Lamont told the
audience. u

Several students stayed around
after the discussion to ask questions
one-on-one with the panel mem-
bers.

Sophomore Patrick McCormack,?
the only male audience member,
came to learn more about the legal
issues of campus security and left
concerned about how students felt
sexual misconduct students were
being handled.

‘‘I think W&L is doing every-
thing it can to live up to the obliga-
tions of the law,” he said. “What,
worries me is that concern about
sexual misconduct cases continues
to be an unresolved issue for so
many ofour classmates.  I think
some students are overwhelmed by»
our current system and I think more
could be done to explain it.”

Schroer-Lamont believes that the
evening was a success if awareness’,
was raised and the audience went
away with helpful information. “If
the program also encourages people
to ask more questions and work to
make our campus even safer, then),
the program was a double success,”
she said.

Websites of the Week

BY MATTHEW CRAIG
PHI STAFF WRITER

This week marks the beginning ofa new feature in
The Ring—tum Phi, the websites of the week. Essen-
tially, every week I plan, to use a trite expression, to
“surf the web,” and locate three webpages that I find
particularly amusing. Each week will also have a theme
of some sort. In other words, I’m going to subject you
to the tyranny of my own sense of humor.

The sites that the Phi" staff has located this week for
your amusement or horror, depending upon how you
look at it, are prime examples of what happens when
people with computers have too much free time. All of
these websites can be accessed from the Phi online at
http: / /www . wlu . edu/~phi. The websites selected
for this week are:

The Cheese Site

http: / /www. trencll . com/~l'1arrisb/cheese/
cheese . html

This site sounds pretty tame, but truthfully it’s pretty
bizarre. The links off of this page include my personal
favorite, the cheese torture shop, the cheese command-
ments, use for 160 slices of American cheese, and what
this guy does in school.

The Elite Giffy Peanut Butter
Exchange

http: / /www . graceland . edu/~elroyomj /

This site is actually some guy’s homepage, who in
an apparent fit of boredom came up with some hilari-
ous links. You can check out two old guys in a sauna or
the ﬁve greatest yak pictures of all time, but first and
foremost, you have to cast your votes in the cool guy
contest. Juan Valdez gets my votes. I just love his pimpy
clothes.

Monkeys Typing Shakespeare

http: / /bronte . cs . utas . edu . au/monkey/

I think this one is pretty self-explanatory, but for those
of you who don't have as keen a grasp of the obvious
I'll provide one. This site is an experiment to see ifa
group of monkeys can randomly type in Shakespeare’s
famous line of “to be or not to be.” So far, they’re do-
ing slightly better than a group of Roanoke college stu-
dents. Hopefully, sometime in the near future, l’ll be
able to hire these guys to write my papers for me.

STUDENT BODY NOTICE p

The Student-Faculty Hearing Board met at the end of Winter Tenn 1997 and heard testi-
mony regarding the complaint of sexual misconduct. The complaint was made by a Washing-

ton and Lee female concerning the sexual misconduct against her by a Washington and Lee
male. The board found the male guilty of unwanted sexual contact and imposed the following

penalties:

° Conseling with a Washington and Lee counselor for a minimum of six hours.
° Referral by a University counselor to an alcohol abuse program.

° Conduct probation for the remainder of residence at Washington and Lee. Any
future conviction on sexual misconduct charges will be grounds for the more
serious penalites of either suspension or dismissal from the University.

According to Yahoo!, W&L cur-

add/drop, and online syllabi.

University Registrar Scott
Dittman told the Phi last week that
he wants to move toward online reg-
istration, but the estimated cost of
$35,000 is too expensive at this
time.

Blackmer said the Yahoo! rep-
resentative did not ask him anything
about student affairs, so he has no

idea where the magazine got its infor-
mation.

Overall, Blackmer said that one can
not put much stock in the ratings.

“For the questions asked, there was
no objective way to know the an-
swers,” said Blackmer.

In addition, part of the rating re-
lied on whether W&L had an online
gaming, chat or dating service; or a
popular online hangout.

W&L did beat out schools such as
Brown (43), Cornell (50), Yale (60),
Harvard (64) and University of Vir-
ginia (69). Topping the list were
Massachusetts Institute of Technology

“Rush is about the women know-
ing each other and mutually select-
ing each other, not about which so-
rority can dazzle the most amount
of girls with the most decorations.”

The newest sorority, Kappa
Delta, will be treated fairly in the
budget for rush dates. “All of the
other sororities have props and

decorations from previous years,
and because KD doesn’t have all of
that stuff, something will be done
to level the playing field.”

McCrone expects and welcomes
questions about the new rush rules
in the upcoming year.

“Panhellenic thinks the new open
contact rules and the move toward
a no frills rush will be positives
changes,”McCrone said. “We are 0
excited to see the results. Rush will M
be changed for the better.”

Soon, running through the woods,

brandishing weapons and hunt
in g camouﬂage-clad opponents will
be an everyday activity in Buena VlStlL
Blue Ridge Paintball will introduce
the city to the sport of paintball when
it opens May 3. T he facility, set on a
wooded two acre ﬁeld, will oﬂer the
excitement and challenge of one of

America ’s newest pastimes.

Paintball is a combination of hide-and-go-
seek and tag, where players “tag” one another
by using air guns to shoot their opponents with
pellets full of paint. The sport, which origi-
nated in the early 1980s, can be played in a
variety ofways, the most common being “Cap-

 

ture the Flag.” In any version of the game,
when a player is hit by a paintball, the
paintball splits open, leaving a bright paint
mark on the person’s clothing. The player
is then out. The paint is nontoxic,
noncaustic and water-soluble, and will wash
out ofclothing and off of skin, according to
the homepage of the National Paintball 

Network. For more information on the'~.‘,_"€
sport, point your web browser to '
http: //www. orrlinepaintball . corn.”

Kenny Lewis, who operates Blue, _
Ridge Paintball, has played and en-
joyed paintball and would recommend" ”
it to anyone.

“It really gets your adrenaline going,”
Lewis said. “lt’s the closest thing to war
games around.”

Lewis’ new facility will offer nearly
two acres of wood and ﬁeld on which to
play two different versions of paintball:

Tickets for musical available

Don’t forget to get tickets for W&L’s production of
“Into the Woods.” The musical is a collaboration of the
music and theater departments. Such collaborations only
occur about once every three years. Previous joint pro-
ductions were “The Marriage of Figaro” and “Evita.”

“It’s a very exciting time,” Professor Al Gordon,
director of the show, said “We all look forward to it
It’s a lovely musical with really intriguing music.”

Molly Harmon said working on the production is
fun “I really enjoy meeting the new people,” she said.

The box oﬂice reports that tickets will probably sell
out by the week before the performances, so reserve
seats now. Performances are May 23, 24 and 25 at 8

Blue Ridge Paintball will offer M68 semi-
automatic paintball airguns with 12 02. C02

ii" four hours, except in the case of large
‘groups (about thirty people), which
.. will be able to rent the guns for a
full day for the same price.
-' §Paintballs will cost $6 for
__ one hundred pellets. The av-

‘=,_ Included in the cost of gun

rental is the use ofa full-fa-

cial mask for eye protection and the use

of the grounds. If you want to use your

‘own paintgun, there is a $6 field charge.

Also, Lewis can fill your CO2 tanks for a
nominal fee.

“We’re new. We’re going to be ﬂexible and
we’ll work with people,” Lewis said.

Players are encouraged to wear clothing
which covers all of their body, including
gloves. Although the balls can sting, play-
ers should not be bothered if they are ad-
equately clothed.

lue Ridge Paintball is located one mile

south on Route 501, about a twenty minute
drive from Lexington. Anyone interested in
playing should call for reservations, pref-
erably four days to a week in advance.
There is no minimum group size, but a
deposit is required for larger groups. For
reservations, call (540) 261-9157.

All proceeds will be used to buy construc-
tion materials. It is the first in what will be-
come a series of events designed to raise
enough money to pay for the house. If all
goes as planned, construction will begin
sometime late next fall.

The dance will be an old-fashioned square
dance. Wildgrass will provide the music and
Becky Mackenzie will call all the dances.
The organizers stress that no previous expe-
rience is needed; they just want everyone to
come out and contribute.

In the meantime, the W&L Habitat
chapter will continue construction on its
third house. Begun earlier this year, the
house should be finished by the middle
of the summer. Usually, students work

from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.

Dust off those Birkenstocks and get
ready to lend a hand. Earth Day comes to
Washington and Lee University Thursday
from 1 la.m. to 3p.m., two weeks after the
national festivities held April 22.

The program, sponsored
Abythe Recycling Commit-
tee and the Environment
Awareness Committee,
calls for a mix of entertain-
ment and volunteerism.

“We’re having an Earth
Day to increase student
awareness of campus envi-
ronmental groups and show
students how much can be
done for the environment,” ﬁeshman Recy-
cling Committee member Katie Hudson said

The main event will be a recycling con-
test. The student or group gathering the
most cans will win a pizza party for thirty
people. Two Night Owl Music gift cer-
tiﬁcates will be given out as door prizes
to people bringing in cans.

Entemtainment in the Graham-Lees

 

led by sophomore Chartlotte Graham.

“The traditionally conservative W&L stu-
dents do not get involved with environmental
issues because they view it as ‘tree-hugging,”
Hudson said. Events like Earth Day, tree
plantings and roadside clean-ups are designed to
change those perceptions and
encourage involvement.

To boast involvement, the
Recycling Committee and En-
vironmental Awareness Com-
mittee are designing a program
to encourage involvement with
the incoming freshmen.

“We have to try and get
people to appreciate the im-
portance of recycling and
other environmental issues,” E.A.C. head
Anthony Dvarskas said.

Both Hudson and Dvarskas encourage
W&L students to pitch in for the environ-
ment. The E.A.C. meets Mondays at 8:30

p.m. in the University Center Game ﬂ

Room. To become a part of the Outing

stomachs, expectations

or the most part, the Delt alumni

have slack jobs and like to show

up early for big weekends in Lexing-
ton. Spos did as much and arrived the Thurs-
day before Alumni Weekend, so we decided
to return to one of our old favorites, The
Staircase, with Spos and “Yale-Boy” Jason
in tow.

The Staircase is located in the basement
of Mountain Copy and Graphics; the own-
ers have done much to improve the
dungeonesque atmosphere that plagued the
previous restaurant in their location. Brightly
lit with music always playing, the atmo-
sphere in The Staircase is great for what they
offer: All-American dining.

The menu is varied, offering everything
from Burgers to Steak to Chicken Florentine
to Vegetable Stir-Fry. The Staircase offers
regular dinner specials on most nights, and the
bar has a wide selection of beverages including
our favorites, Guinness and Bass, on tap.

Jason, having recently ﬁnished his En-
glish Comps, decided to eat early and dedi-
cate the rest of the evening to assorted bev-
erages. We “ordered up a mess of’ Buffalo
Wings to start. Doug and Spos enjoyed
them, but Robin found the wings to be a
little too spicy for her palette. The res-
taurant was really packed and the wings
were slow coming out of the kitchen but
were worth the wait.

Ehicago playing respectably
FAN from page 8

Hekt and his old team, the Knicks, might be entertain-
ing, the Lakers-Jazz series in the Western Conference
should easily be the best series of the second round and
will likely determine which team will lose to the Bulls in
the ﬁnals this year. The Lakers have Shaq, which can be
a h‘essing or a curse depending on which way you look
at it, but the Jazz have Karl Malone, who keeps getting
better with age. This will be the big test to see if Utah
, It finally end its perpetual playoff misery. Speaking
isery, the Chicago Cubs should adopt Dog’s Eye
V1e~w’s “Everything Falls Apart” as their official theme
song. Don’t look now, things just got worse. This hap-
pened Friday night when closer Mel Rojas blew up in
Los Angeles.

‘ J he Cubies had actually begun to play semi-respect-
jble ball lately before handing the ball to Rojas with a 7-
‘ lead in the ninth inning Friday. Rojas then put on a
w that would make even Mitch Williams wince.

Ironically, it was on a Friday night at this same time of
year in 1993 when the Wild Thing entered a game in LA
with a 7-6 lead and walked the bases loaded with no outs
before somehow retiring the side for the save. Rojas‘ did
him one better. Mel walked the bases loaded, and then
after getting two outs and the pressure mounting, he walked
another batter to force in the tying run. The Dodgers went
on to win in the 10th and the Cubs sank to 6-21.

Chicago had signed Rojas to a $13.75 million con-
tract in the off-season, thinking that on those rare oc-
casions when the starting pitcher made it to the 8th or
9th inning with a lead, Rojas could nail it down. In-
stead he has blown three of five save chances, and man-
ger Jim Riggleman is spelling “relief” with a four-
letter word.

But while the Cubs continue to find innovative
ways to lose, at least Harry Caray’s bar in Chicago
is making money with its 45-cent beers. Why 45
cents? The last time the Cubs won the NL pennant
was in 1945.

5 he answer is . . .

It is one thing to question the Honor System, it is
'~ nether to do it anonymously.

I A letter from a concerned group of students was
tinted in the last edition of the Trident. These students
V‘ uestioned the outcome of recent trials, cited instances
f paranoia and specifically criticized members of the
&L community for not upholding the portion of the
hite Book that requires “a student with knowledge of
possible honor violation (to) confront the person

- ected and ask for an explanation of the incident.”
All of these are valid concerns, questions many of
s have asked ourselves at one time or another. But

> ithout knowing who wrote it, the credibility of the

V: uthors is immediately diminished.

Our single sanction system has survived for over a

.00 years because of student criticism. At one time
omosexuality was considered a violation of the Honor
'y§tem. Today’s concept of dishonorable conduct has
volved beyond sexual preference.

The Honor System is meant to evolve with the
tudent body. The White Book Review Committee is
harged with examining all aspects of the Honor Sys-
m. This includes asking what the Washington and Lee
oﬂimunity thinks about the Honor System.

This has been a year for openly questioning the

or System. The Executive Committee recently
vised the White Book after hearing the White Book
eview Committee’s recommendations. The spark lit by
eir questions should not be snuffed out.

‘Y What has led the anonymous students to believe

ey are living in George Orwell's 1984? When did our
ampus, our students, become hostile to informed,
ncerned criticism?

" There are those among us who attack proponents of
. ange. There are those among us who believe that what
should always be. There are those among us who

ou_ld attack students for criticizing the Executive“
oilnmittee.

The student body needs to protect itself. We need
create an environment where students don’t fear vocal
iitjcism of the EC will result in backlash and ridicule.

0 There is no reason students should fear what they
-eated and now control. The answer is open criticism in
I open environment. If we fail to do this the Honor
ygem will crumble like those of many other universi-
es across the country.

Welfare reform
threatens lives

The countdown has begun. To
students at Washington and Lee,
this countdown could be a variety
of things: for seniors, a countdown
to graduation; for other students,
simply a countdown to the end of
Spring term. But the countdown to
which I refer has deeper conse-
quences and implications for
5(X),(X)0— a half million — legal
immigrants. Forsomc mcmbersof

this countdown will perhaps make
the difference between life and
death. ln 100 days, the problems
which legal immigrants face will
increase a hundredfold.

On August 22, 1996, President
Clinton signed into law a highly
controversial welfare bill which,
among other things, created a ban
on all public beneﬁts to legal immi-
grants. Beginning August 1 of this
year, legal immigrants will system-
aticallybedeniedfoodstamps,non—
emergency health care and supple-
mentary Social Securitypayments.

The refusal of supplemental
security income beneﬁts is by far
the most signiﬁcant provision. S1
is the govemment’s basic cash as-
sistanee program for the elderly
and disabled poor. As the law
cunently stands, these beneﬁts can

only be received when the legal
immigrant earns his U.S. citizen-
ship. However, many of these
people — due to the fact that they
are elderly or disabled ~— are not
able to fulﬁll the requirements to
gain citizenship. 'lhus, these legal
immigruntswill be denied lite-sus-

taining assistance for the rest of

their lives.

In a study by the Urban Insti-
tute, it was found that L2 million

be made poor by the new welfare
law —— nearly half — were legal
immigrants. lnthe Newt Gingrich-
led 104th Congress’ intense clamor

grants only account for a mere
5% of federal welfare expendi-

they will be under the welfare

is this the type of welfare
reform the American people
wanted? While our motives for
welfare reform were good —
movingable-bodied people from

rolls —— did we intend to move
elderly and disabled people who
have the distinction of being “le-
gal immigrants” from hospitals
and nursing homes to homeless
shelters and streets?

These sentiments are not ex-
clusively “liberal” or “Demo-
cratic.” Republican governors
with large immigrant constitu-
encieshavebecomeincreasingly
worried and have recently gone

fear the public relations disaster
that is sure to occur once legal
immigrants stop receiving fed-
eral beneﬁts. if the federal gov-
ernment does not continue its

assistance to legal immi-
grants, they will be forced
to limit their own expendi-
tures in other salient areas
such as job training and
child care. Although Re-
publicans in Congress refuse
to acknowledge legal immi-
grants’ existence and need
for assistance, legal immi-
grants are a presence that
cannot be ignored.

Guard your spring term fun against May rain

ldon’t think I’m alone in being sorely
disappointed with the weather so far for
most of spring term. Lexington is sup-
posed to be an Edenic ﬁeld of sunshine,
full of ﬂowers and singing birds--the kind
of weather that makes it impossible to be

inside. Instead, for ‘most o£.the.past few
weeks, it has been cold and cloudy. Gale
force winds have forced us into the library
to take shelter. This is spring term? My
last one? i want my money back!

Judging from the view out my win-
dow, it looks like our worries are over and
spring is ﬁnally here. But in case it’s not,
here are a few possible ways to cope with
the weather.

Work with it. Okay, so the weather’s

less than perfect. We’re all smart people;
we can make this fun. Maybe you wish
you could go to Goshen and bask on a rock
in the sun. Instead, why not don a wetsuit
and round up a few friends for ice ﬁshing?
Wooeee, doesn’t that sound fun?

Maybe this weather can be a way for
you to experiment. What does bourbon
taste like heated? If you put it in your
favorite drinkin’ mug and garnish it with
acinnamon stick, it mightnot be bad. And
you already know that warm beer isn’t so
tasty§‘b’§i£inayt;iE hot beer would be better.
Hint: take thebéer out of the can before
you put it in the microwave.

Finally, W&Lstudents can make any-
thing into adrinking game ifthey put their
minds to it. Gather up some friends.
Drink once for every cloud in the sky. For
every 2 MPH the wind blows, drink once.
Chug until it stops raining. Before long,
you’ll forget how cold it is outside.

DeniaL Here’s your logic: it’s May.

May is a warm month. So gosh darn it, I
will act like it’s warm. No matter how
cold it is, wear shorts and sunglasses at all

times. Carry around iced tea to quench
your thirst. Lay out, even if it’s raining.
You’ll still get to do all of the fun things
you associate with spring term, for the

low, low cost of pneumonia!

WorkMurphy’s Law. If we all work
together, we can trick the twisted laws of
nature into giving us what we want. Go
out and buy a whole lot of sweaters and a
new wintercoat and wear them all at once.
Buy fourumbrellas, just in case. Put snow
tires on your car. Send the power com-
pany money in advance for the big heat-
ing bill you’ll be racking up. Before long,
we’ll have a heat wave.

The one solution ldon’t recommend is

library.” Don’t think to yourself, “it’s

don’t forget what l’ve learned.” Don’t

Post office grapples with e-mail technology

The Lexington Post Ofﬁee, the only one in the country to

‘still use the Pony Express, has recently been ﬂooded with

mail sporting incomprehensible addresses. Apparently,
numerous mentally deﬁcient rednecks have been trying to
latch ontothe new technology of e-mail. ‘‘I can’t tell you how
many letters we get each week addressed to something like

My View

Kevin MeManemin ’0O

frank_costanza@hotmail.com orkmcdonald@comell.edu,”
Postmaster General Norm Fitzblatz said.

Other silly people try to apply the modern terminology to
old addresses, resulting in addresses such as
Tarquin_Ki$enger@23l_Lrberty_StreetPlainﬁeld.NJ.07062.

‘‘I suppose we can ﬁgure out where to mail those, but we
just really don’t care,” Fitzblatz said.

“Normally, if one of those letters slips into my bag, it just
ends up in the gutter,” post(wo)man Sally Wobgobbler said.
When asked if she meant the letters with the e-mail addresses,

she replied, “No, just any letters in general.”

‘‘I haven’t really noticed any difference in the mail lately,”
long—time post ofﬁce employee Charles Bobby Joe John
Jordan Danny Donnie Bob Bobby Bob Bob Bo Bob
Rockenfeller said. “Then again, I can’t read.”

Rockefeller was unmoved by the plight of the mistaken
mailers. ‘‘I haven’t done any work here since the late sixties
and l’ll be damned if I start caring about other people’s mail
now,” Rockefeller said.

Other postal employees took a different approach to
problems with the mail. “They all must die! They all must
die! They all must die!” Cy Copath muttered as he shivered
in the comer, clutching his assault riﬂe. Agreeing with
Copath was Susan Looni, who spoke to us from behind the
sandbags pi led on her desk. ‘‘If they can’t get the addresses
right, I say brutally murder them all,” Looni said. M

The postal employees have not seen anything like this in
Lexington since the advent of the phone. Back then, the post
ofﬁce had to deal with tons of letters addressed to numbers
like 555-8536 or 1-9(1)-909-4300. The advent of the phone
in Lexington having occured just three years ago, they still
receive a fair amount of such mail today. “Don’t even
mention the telegraph,” Fitzblatz said. “You try ﬁguring out

where to mail ..—.—.-..-.——-.——.—.-...”

“The most revolting part about working at the Lexington
Post Ofﬁce, aside from theodorof tobacco juicecomingfrom
where the toothless yokels licked the stamps—l’m sorry, l
suppose that is the most revolting part about working here,”
Dean of the Post Ofﬁce Larry Walsh said.

Why is there a dean of the post ofﬁce? ‘“lhere’s some-
thing in the town chatter about one out of every four
Lexington residents having to be a dean,” some old guy who
once read the town charter explained.

‘ ‘‘I myself am distrustful of the mail. Why, I gota letterfrom
EdMcMahonpromisingme$10millionseveral yeaisago,and
l’m still waiting for my check,” Nigel Phipps, a Lexington
resident who gets a lot of mail, said. Phipps got his draft notice
just last week and will soon be off to ﬁght for our American
freedomsagainst Hitler, Mumlini and that Japanese guy. “l’ll
just clean out my musket, catch the next stagecoach to the base
and join up with my cavalry regiment,” a noticeably drunk
Phipps said. When asked if he had any suggestions as to how
thisarticleshouldend, Phippsreplied,“lsupposeyou could end
it with another telegraph joke.” When asked if he had a better
suggestion foranendingtothispiece, Phippssuggested that we
leave him the  alone. And so we shall.

“We were cheering for the clock,” a VMI
senior said.

The Generals dominated the Keydets for
55 minutes of the 10th Lee-Jackson Clas-
sic Saturday, and came away with a 22-8
victory before 2,800 fans at Alumni Sta-
dium. It was the Generals’ ninth straight
win over VMI.

Washington and Lee’s 22 goals broke
their previous Lee-Jackson high of 18
scored in 1990 and 1993.

W&L dominated VMI in every aspect of
the game, from goals, to shots, to face-offs.
The Generals also physically overpowered
VMI using their team speed to run circles
around the Keydets.

"Every year we get pumped up," said
junior Tom Fallace. "They're a very physi-
cal and hard-working team -- we like to play
up to their level."

Senior Ande Jenkins led the Generals
with ﬁve goals and three assists earning him
the Worrel—Fallon award for Most Valuable
Player in the Lee-Jackson Classic. The
eight points gave him 86 points for the sea-
son, breaking the school record of 85 set

Jenkins led off the scoring one minute
into the game setting the tone for the rest
ofthe game.

W&L out shot VMI 68-26.

VMI evened the score, but Ed Dougherty
and freshman Colin Dougherty scored three

goals to end the first quarter 4-1.

After trading goals early in the second
quarter, the Generals held the Keydets
scoreless until 6:30 left in the third quar-
ter. During that period, the Generals scored
10 unanswered goals.

W&L led 10-2 at the half. Jenkins
started the second halfthe same way as the
ﬁrst, scoring 1:09 into the third quarter. A
minute later, Colin Dougherty intercepted
the VMI goalie’s pass and passed it to fresh-
man Lee Fentress, who scored on the open
net to increase the lead to 12-2.

Colin Dougherty followed 16 seconds
later with another goal.

The Generals had a goal waved off be-
cause ofa crease violation right before the
end ofthe third quarter. The quarter ended
16-3. Junior Robb Greenﬁeld grabbed the
ball 56 seconds into the fourth quarter and

of the season.

First NCAA title in sight for women’s tennis

Junior Berry Blankinship will represent the
W&L women’s tennis team in the NCAA
tournament.

BY JASON ZACHER
PHI EXECUTIVE EDITOR

Appearances can be deceiving.

While the women’s tennis team looked light and jok-
ing at practice last week, they are intensely focused on
their goal this week — capturing the national title that has
eluded them for two years.

“That’s the thing that’s deceptive about this team.
They’re loose, they’re laughing, they’re having fun. It is
obvious they enjoy what they are doing, but when it’s time
to buckle down, they dig in,” said coach Cinda Rankin.

Led by juniors Natalia Garcia, Berry Blankinship and
Ericka Shapard, the team starts play tomorrow against
Pomona-Pitzer on Pomona’s home court. Last year, the
Generals fell to Emory University 5 in the championship.

The Generals received a fourth seed for this year’s
NCAA tournament. Kenyon College is ﬁrst, followed by
Emory and Amherst. Earlier in the season, the Generals
lost to Kenyon and Amherst by a score of 6-3. “We lost to
them, but we’re not down because of it. We’re anxious to
play them,” said Rankin.

Blankinship added, “we’re hungrier than we would
have been if we had beaten them.”

In addition to the team’s NCAA bid, Garcia and
Shapard earned individual bids. The doubles team of
Garcia and freshman Brook Hartzell also earned a bid.

The team has some very high expectations placed on
them. They have finished in the top six for each of the
last three years, including a second place ﬁnish last year.
This year, they blew through their competition, sweeping
eight matches 9-0, beating two tournament teams (Mary
Washington and Sewanee), winning the ODAC title for
the seventh straight year, and on top of this, ﬁve of their
seven players already have NCAA tournament experience.

The experience may be what pays off for the Generals.
“I know what to expect. As a freshman I was over-
whelmed. 1 didn’t know what to expect. Now, there is
less pressure,” said Blankinship.

“They know what to expect, and that teaches you a
lot,” added Rankin.

With this experience, and their dominating play all sea-

son, there are some people who feel this is the Generals’
year.

“They’re right,” said Blankinship. “We’re incredibly
strong this year. Our attitude is different and we are more
pumped-up.”

The Generals face a tough challenge this week.
Pomona-Pitzer’s number one singles player, senior Claire
Turchi, is a former singles national champion. More im-
portantly, the Generals are in the same bracket with
Gustavus Adolphus College and Kenyon.

“We know it is (Pomona’s) home court, and we know
they have an extremely strong top of the lineup. Our
strength is down the line, we’ve got good players all the
way,” commented Rankin. ‘

Despite others’ expectations, the Generals are keep-
ing theirs to a minimum. Coach Rankin commented,
“I try to have no expectations because expectations lead
to disappointment. lfwe play the best we can, no mat-
ter what happens, 1 will be really excited."

Total domination.

That was the theme of the day Saturday afternoon
as Washington and Lee hammered Virginia Military
Institute, 22-8, at Alumni Memorial Field to win its
ninth straight Lee-Jackson Lacrosse classic.

Unlike‘ recent years where the Keydets have resil-
iently hung around, they had no chance this year. A
W&L squad angered at barely missing the Division
III tournament took out its frustration on an over-
matched VMI team. The generals stormed out to a
10-2 half-time lead and extended it to 17-3 by the
end of the third before the Keydets made the score
somewhat more respectable.

What was more impressive than the final score
was the way the Generals completely dominated the
Keydets. They totally outplayed, out hustled, and out
muscled a team from a military school, of all placed’.
Almost the entire game was played on the VMI half
of the ﬁeld, a tremendous effort by the Generals.

No matter how well they played Saturday, it will
still be tough for the Generals to wash away the bit;
ter taste of Tuesday’s upset loss to Randolph-Ma-
con, which ended any chance of making the Division
III playoffs. But there is no way that an 1 1-3 season
and a #10 ranking in Division III should be classiﬁed
as disappointing. Congratulations to the Generals for
a well-played season.

The first round of the NBA playoffs is ﬁnally com-
pleted and now the real actions begins. (Is there any
good reason why the NBA and NHL need to includ
nearly two-thirds of its teams in the playoffs and ex-
tend the season two more months? For the most part
it only serves to milk some more TV dollars and sub-
ject viewers to watching the Clippers and Bullets three
more games than needed. And to think so many .
people complain about the wild card round in base-

- ball. . .) Although the match-up between Pat Riley’s
