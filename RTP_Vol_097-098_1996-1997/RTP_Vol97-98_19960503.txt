Theta dominatg Derby Days:

Event raises funds for local charities

BY LIZ DETIER
PHI NEWS STAFF WRITER

W &L has Sigma Chi to thank for a
great start to Spring Term.

Once again, Spring Term started out
with Derby Days, a week-long annual
fundraiser for charity sponsored by Sigma
Chi. Derby Days is a competition between
the four sororities to score points and raise
money for their respective charities.

This year, Derby Days kicked-off with

I Spider Monkey at Zollman’s, and was fol-

lowed by football games, a reggae band on
the river, “Singled Out,” Field Day, and a
wine party at Zollman’s.

Derby Days Chairman David Jones
said “The general consensus was that the
girls had a good time, and I know the guys
had a good time.”

This year, Derby Days raised $5500,
according to Jones. The funds were raised

through a combination of T-shirt sales. ads
in the Derby Days programs, the two

Zollman’s parties, and penny voting for
Derby Days King and Queen.

The sororities competed in T-shirt
sales, Penny Voting, Football, “Singled
Out,” and Field Day. Theta and Cl ll-O tied
in T-shirt sales.

Matt Ermigioti and Pi Phi Marga-
ret Lunger were voted Derby King and
Queen.

Meanwhile, Kappa came in first in
football, followed by Th eta.

The results of “Singled Out” were dates
for Derek Van Zant and Theta Jen Galardi,
Jason Ward and Pi Phi Megan Fernstrum,
and Grant Jordan and Theta Kirsten
Smith.

“Singled Out,” a mock version of the
popular MTV game show, was a new addi-
tion to Derby Days and replaced last year’s
“Sorority Feud.”

Most people enjoyed “Singled Out.”

“I think Singled Out should become a tra-
dition. I was cut out pretty early for having
dark eyes, butI played,” said junior Michelle
Bauman.

The overall winner of Derby Days was
Kappa Alpha Theta, followed by Kappa
Kappa Gamma, Chi Omega, and Pi Beta Phi.

Fifty percent of the money raised will be
donated to Sigma Chi’s charity, the Special
Olympics.

The remaining proﬁts will be split among

the sororities, with twenty percent going to
Theta’s charity, CourtAppointed Special Ad-
vocates, ﬁfteen percent to Kappa’s charity,
United Way, ten percent to Chi-O’s charity,
Total Action Against Poverty, and ﬁve per-
cent to Pi Phi’s charity, Links to Literacy.

Derby Days was a great time for a great
cause, and W & L looks forward to it again
next year.

As sophomore Danielle Simonetta put it,
“It’s absolutely one of my favorite weeks at
W&L!”

Bush speaks on state of world affairs

BY LIZ DETIER

PHI NEWS STAFF WRITER
0 ver 3,000 people gathered together

in VMI’s Cameron Hall last Thurs-
day to listen to former President George
Bkush address the VMI cadets. The 41st
president talked about everything from
Desert Storm to Dana Carvey in his hour
long speech.

Bush spoke vehemently about the fu-
ture of the United States and its role in
the world arena. “The United St ates must
continue to stay engaged in the world, ex-
actly the way we did in the Cold War, even
though only one superpwer exists, “said
the former president. He cited such ex-
amples as the tyrannical Saddam Hussein
to support his argument.

Conversely, the former president
stressed how important it was for people

to realize how far the United States has come
in its pursuit of world peace. “We’ve only
begun to reap the beneﬁts of our success in
the Cold War, “declared Bush.

For those who were still complaining
about the state of world affairs, Bush had
only one thing to say: “Roll up your sleeves,
don’t sit b——ing about it.”

The ﬂamboyant ex-president is only the
latest in a series of prominent speakers who
have graced VMI’s campus over the past thir-
teen years as part of the H.P. Johnson, Jr.
‘26 Lecture Series. The ﬁrst speaker in the
series was former President Gerald Ford in
1983, and the last to visit VMI was George
Bush’s Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, in
1993.

The man who endows the series in
memory of his father, a VMI graduate of 1926,
is Belton Kelberg Johnson. According to VMI
Director of Public Relations Lt. Col. Mike

Strickler, the fact that Johnson is a “Texas
Ranger” most likely contributed to his being
able to persuade Bush to visit VMI.

As for Bush’s fee for coming to VMI,
Strickler declined to comment. As George
Bush or Dana Carvey might say, “Not gonna
do it. Wouldn’t be prudent.”

Honor System 1757 
needsinspecﬁon

Absolut Tradition
Paul Saboe ’97

when the sun is shining,
the sky is clear, and a
slight breeze cools the campus,
Head of Security MikeYoung lik-
ens Washington and Lee to a
“little piece of heaven.” [His
words are laced with a certain
truth for there is something
magical about this place, some-
thing which transcends the pres-
ence of Lee Chapel and the Col-
onnade, the knowledge and wis-
dom of the faculty, the untold po-
tential and talents of the student
body.

In essence, the magic of Wash-
ington and Lee ﬂows not from
what we are, but what we hold
dear. Ideals like honor, service,
and community distinguish us
from other academic institutions
as a standard for admiration and
imitation. This column will fo-
cus on those ideals, traditions,
and people who make them pos-
sible in a world such as ours that
more and more has forsaken op-
timism and heroics for cynicism
and apathy.

The ﬁght for honor is a con-
stant struggle, a means and ends
to which very few communities
are willing to dedicate them-
selves. But this we have done
at Washington and Lee. That
myself and others have been able
to freely raise points of discus-
sion regarding a difﬁcult notion
such as honor is testimony to the
enormous confidence we have
placed in our honor system. But
is confidence enough?

It is deﬁnitely more than the
cadets at the U.S. Naval Acad-
emy possess. Over the years,
they have lost control of their
Honor Concept (1 will not lie,
cheat, or steal, and will let the
whole truth be known) only to

L have it replacedvby what An-

napolis instructor James F.
Barry called, “an ethically cor-
rupting system.”

In a 1992 incident, 133 stu-
dents were implicated in a cheat-
ing scandal that saw 24 midship-
men dismissed. In 1995, twenty-
four “would-be officers” were

caught in a drug bust. Within
the past month two seniors were
charged with breaking and en-
tering, a third senior was ar-
rested for molesting a young
child, and “an Academy ﬁve-
striper” was accused of sexually
harassing several women under
his command.

These examples highlight the
often hypocritical, ever cynical
culture that pervades the Naval
Academy, a culture which views
“bilging’ [turning in a classmate]
as an offense far worse than any
honor violation, “loyalty as more
important than truth,” and
honor as an obstacle to over-
come. In essence, the Naval
Academy is the example of what
we are striving most to avoid at
Washington and Lee.

Could our Honor Code ever
decay to the level of the Naval
Academy’s Honor Concept? Yes,
in fact the first signs of decay
may even be visible. In the 1995
senior Exit Survey, 42% of the
graduating seniors surveyed
said they were uncertain
whether they would turn in a
person they knew had commit-
ted an honor violation. The pri-
mary reasons given for this hesi-
tancy to report possible viola-
tions were the relationship to the
violator and a dislike of ratting.
It seems that the dislike for
“bilging” at the Naval Academy
is alive and well at Washington
and Lee.

It is this hesitancy which we
must combat through public dia-
logue, a dialogue consisting of
the proposed student panel dis-
cussion on honor, the upcoming
White Book Review, and infor-
mal discussion. Conﬁdence in
our system by itself will not suf-
ﬁce. Dedication is needed, the
dedication to follow the Honor
Code, to turn in known violators,
and to expand our notion of
honor. Faith is also needed, the

fa,i,_t_h,to believethat through our

system, honor will be achieved
and justice served. It is only
through the combination of con-
fidence, dedication, and faith
that we will achieve a notion of
honor worthy of our position as
the heirs to Washington and Lee,
and all they hold dear.

Washington’s Blood Sport

Ends & Means
Joshua Heslinga ’98

As the 1996 election approaches and the
public begins to reﬂect on the Clinton
presidency, no doubt some of the most en-
during memories will be of scandal. The
Clintons and White House personnel have
repeatedly attempted to put such scandals
as Whitewater, the death of Vince Foster, the
firing of the White House travel staff,
’I‘roopergate, and the Paula Jones sexual ha-
rassment case behind them.

’I‘o their surprise and consternation, they
have had little success and; have only suc-
ceeded in raising more questions with con-
stant hedging, denials, protestations or ig-
norance, and attempts to place the blame
elsewhere.

A few weeks ago, James B. Stewart pub-
lished Blood Sport, the first and most thor-
ough attempt to put these scandals together;
reveal exactly what happened, and explain
why these scandals won‘t die.

Some of you have probably heard some-
thing of this book, and before recommend-
ing it for what it says, it’s useful to dispel a
couple of misconceptions that might arise
about the book.

Stewart is not a tabloid reporter looking
for dirt. He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1988 for
reporting on the stock market crash and in-
sider trading, which he followed up with the
#1 New York Times best-seller Den of
Thieves, and served as the front-page editor
of The Wall Street Journal This ﬁnancial
expertise makes him uniquely qualiﬁed to

sort out the mess of the Whitewater Devel-
opment Company and Madison Guaranty
S&L.

This book is not an unsolicited tell-all.
Stewart began this book at the Clintons
behest, and they quickly promised full coop-
eration. Revealingly, after an initial meet-
ing that Stewart had with Hillary Clinton,
this cooperation never materialized, al-
though Stewart interviewed many key ﬁg-
ures in the thick of the scandals for the ﬁrst
time.

As Stewart’s background might tell you,
this book is a complete and detailed look at
the scandals revolving around the Clinton
administration. Those looking for a hatchet
job on the Clintons andthose looking for an
apologia on their behalf are both likely to be
disappointed.

By contrast, if you’re intrigued by the at-
mosphere surrounding these scandals, if you
want to know what the fuss is all about, or
if you’d like to get a little insight into key
ﬁgures of the Clinton administration and the
workings of the media, this book is for you.

Stewart does not suddenly unearth a
smoking gun, and he gives little credit to
many of the more popular conspiracy theo-
ries surrounding Foster’s death and other
administrative events. This has allowed the
Clintons to attempt to dismiss Stewart’s
work as old news, but they are wrong in do-
ing so. While this book does relate the facts
and’ many details of the scandals, it is ulti-
mately about more than that.

This book revolves around people, creat-
ing a very readable, if intricate, story It
gives a rare glimpse at a clannishArkansas
political culture, a relentlessly digging me-

dia, and a Washington atmosphere where,
as Vince Foster wrote, “ruining people is
considered a sport.” And it exposes the at-
titudes of key ﬁgures on all sides, with  1-
plications that the Clintons should haﬁly
be proud of.

The illegality of many of the issues sur-
rounding Whitewater is a complex mat er
for which the only deﬁnitive answer will
come from independent counsel Ken Star1’s
investigation. But the unethical nature of
many of the dealings involved and of the
Clinton’s private lives is clear.

While Bill and Hillary Clinton cam-
paigned against the ‘80s as the “Decade of

Greed,” they and their associates engaged ’

in the same pursuits. As the Clintons re-
peatedly professed innocence and wondered
why the media didn’t just accept presiden-
tial proclamations without question, they
and their associates blocked information in-
quiries, changed their stories repeatedly
and in some cases, blatantly lied.

In the end, James B. Stewart’s Blood

Sport should serve as a call to theAmeri- V

can people to think about exactly what kind
of people should lead our country It doesn’t
pretend to equate Whitewater with
Watergate. But neither does it attempt to
disguise the Clinton’s careless, immoral,
and unethical behavior that they, particu-
larly Hillary, imperially believe should be
disregarded.

Are we prepared to answer these tough
questions, or have we all, like the Clintons,
become “deeply enmeshed in a Washington
culture so inured to partisan distortion and

spin that truth is the most frightening pros-

pect of all?”

with us. He’s a senior and
has retired from the fast-paced,
high-pressure world of humor
columnists. The idyllic world we
know as Dream Land, full of Lee-
Hi waitresses, seances, and
Hollins formals, is no more. I
suppose now would be a good
time for me to write a tribute to
Richard, but what can I say that
hasn’t been said a thousand
times before? What could I say
that hasn’t been written about
in La ’I‘oya Jackson songs, that
hasn’t kept us up at night, that
hasn’t torn at the depths of our
very souls?

I’ll get to the point.

From now until my own re-
tirement, my column will come
to you every single week. Terri-
fying, isn’t it? All it took was a
well-formulated argument to our
new Editorial Page Editor Jason
Zacher (I might as well start
sucking up now). The summit
between us went something like
this:

Betsy: Can I write my column
once a week? Please?

Richard Weaver is no longer

Jason: Okay.

So, right now, in addition to
the usual pressures of Spring
'I‘erm — should I wear shoes to
class, is 30 a high enough SPF
for my trip to Goshen, when does
the ABC store close and where
are my books — I have a new
pressure. I have to be funny, on
demand, twice as often as I used
to be. Yikes!

One of the worst things any-
one can do to another human
being is to introduce them to a
stranger and immediately tell
the stranger that he is funny.
Whenever that happens to me, I
stand there and smile, trying
desperately to think of some-
thing that is witty, current, so-
cially relevant, and appropriate
for the situation. Usually I tell
a stupid knock-knock joke and
escape to get a drink, thinking
that if my friend had not an-
nounced that I was funny, I
might have actually been funny
and I probably told that joke
wrong, which makes it even less
funny and now I can think of a
million more funny things I
could have said, but I would look
really dumb if I went back over
there and tried to salvage things
and I really wish I had worn

shoes to class. In short, it is hard
to be funny on demand.

Consequently, I developed a
training program over Spring
Break to put me in top comedic
condition. If you want, try to
imagine me doing these things
while “Eye of the Tiger” plays in
the background.

Monday: Slip on a banana
peel. Repeat.

Tuesday: Speed typing
drills, done wearing big yellow
duck suit.

Wednesday: Juggle rubber
chickens.

Thursday: Watch old epi-
sodes of “The Muppet Show,” “I
love Lucy,” and “Fantasy Island,”
taking copious notes. Ponder the
questions, “What is funny?”,
“How can irony be developed?”,
“How did Lucy get all those
chocolates down her blouse?”
and “Why didn’t Tattoo have a
successful ﬁlm career?”

Friday: Take ﬁeld trip to the
Palms. Do what comes natu-
rally.

Saturday: Compose lists of
things that are funny, ie: cheese.
squirrels, shaving cream, and
winter rush; and of things that
are not funny, like famine,
plague, pollution, and uncom-

Sunday: Rest.

I really hope this works, oth-

Leftover Salmon and Magraw Gap:

M.icountr)\!,~ It’s a blind hopein

,;:.Bg, Michoel Heiwletfrw
Phi Book Peviewer

You’ve seen it on CNN
and read about it in the news-
paper and the magazines.
Everybody seems obsessed
with this book, Primary Col-
ors. The only thing is that no
one knows who wrote it—
not even the power-brokers
at Random House who pub-
lished the book. lt’s simply a
novel of politics by Anony-
mous. Now, most have
pointed to George
Stephanopoulos, Mary
Matalin, and James Carville
as possible suspects. Still,
no one really knows; they’re
just guessing.

But the truth is that it does
not matter who wrote it. The
book is a good read, espe-
cially for those political buffs
out there.

The novel follows the
experiences of Henry Bur-
ton, a biracial congressional
aide and grandson of a fa-
mous civil rights activist,
who gets sucked into the
presidential campaign of
Governor Jack Stanton. He
gets behind this guy who he
thinks will make history,
someone who will make a
fundamental change in this

the possibility of what poli-
tics can deliver.

Unfortunately, as he is
dragged further into the
sewer like atmosphere of
political wheeling and deal-
ing, he realizes that although
Stanton has a connection
with people, he has some
serious ethical problems.
Scandal after scandal come
uncovered, and Burton must
reconsider his faith in the
political process and ques-
tion his racial identity and of
course, find love instead of
campaign sex.

Political pundits have
continuously pointed to how
similar the situations in the
book are to the Clinton cam-
paign.

Although it is a work of
ﬁction, many will recognize
questions of draft-dodging
and extramarital affairs as
the same questions that
dogged Clinton before he
became the “Comeback
Kid.”

No doubt that Clinton-
lovers and Clinton-haters
alikewillrelishtryingto rec-
ognize what characters rep-
resent George
Stephanopoulos, James
Carville, Bill Clinton, and
Hillary Clinton.

.. I. Furthermore, this author
knows how to weave a good
tale, a story that moves the
reader and urges him to keep
turning the page. I could not
put the book down because I
wanted to ﬁnd out what other
surprise awaited this down-
trodden campaign.

At the same time, the
book gave a greatertruth like
all great literature seeks to
do. Essentially, politics is
about figuring out who gets
what in this society. Some-
times, it’s not pretty and
surely not always ethical. If
we allow it, politics corrupts,
disintegrating our civility
and destroying our human-
ity. Instead of leading to
truths, it only leads to lies
and distortion. As the author
makes clear in this book, the
truth rarely matters. What
matters is how one can shape
facts to fit a particular
candidate’s agenda.

Of course, maybe we al-
ready knew that about poli-
tics and maybe it’s obvious.

“The play asks if it is possible for

James and the Giant Peach: not Nightmare Ill

Bg Qlex Christensen

Phi Movie Reviewer

*** 1/2 of 4 stars; more than worthy
The pitch: “It’ll be like The Nightmare Before Christ-
mas meets The Muppets Take Manhattan!”

When Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas
was released, critics raved and gushed, loving the wonder-
ful music by Danny Elfman, the ingenious story by Tim
Burton, and the intriguing, dark, visually stunning stop-
motion of Henry Selick. It was compared with The
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, The Wizard of Oz, and other
fantastic classics of the screen. Recent re-viewings cer-
tainly show that the ﬁlm is holding up under this pressure,
and is one of those ﬁlms that so captures a wide audience’s
imagination that it is an “instant classic” (Disney writes
this under the titles of all its animated features; it has not
quite been true since Aladdin).

The point of this introduction is to dispel any notion
among those who are interested in seeing James and the
Giant Peach that it is another wonderful concoction in
which Elfman, Burton, and Selick put their heads together

to create a modern classic. This is not to denigrate the ﬁlm
at all. But if anyone is expecting a ﬁlm remotely similar to
some idea of Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christ-
mas Part II: The Revenge, there is a large disappointment
waiting at the theater.

Some have referred to the ﬁlm congratulating Burton on
his dark, startling imagery, commenting on his trademark
techniques and story features, and his unique vision. But
with James, as with the horrendous summer disaster Batman
Forever, any credit or blame that is assignable to Burton is
as a producer, not a director or creative consultant. The
vision, the story, the style-all belong-to Henry Selick, and he
is due all the credit for the success of James.

As you can probably tell from the title, if you have not
already read the ubiquitous Roald Dahl book upon which
this ﬁlm is based, it is the story ofa young boy, James Henry
Trotter (Paul Terry), and his adventures with a giant peach.
If you don’t want more of a basic plot set—up than that, you
should probably skip the next paragraph.

James is trapped in a horrible life with his aunts Spiker
(Joanna Lumley of the BBC’s fabulous Absolutely Fabu-
lous and former Bond girl) and Sponge (Miriam Margolyes)
when he is approached by “The Old Man” (Pete
Postlethwaite), who offers him a sack of magic squirmy
things which, he promises, will change everything. James
drops the sack, however, and the squirmy things work their
magic on a bunch of garden bugs and a peach tree, which
produces a giant-sized peach. Magically, James is trans-

formed into a stop-motion character and enters the peach to
find the giant-sized bugs, who become his fast friends by the
time the peach rolls down the hill and theirjourney begins.

Okay, no more spoilers, you can read on now. Excellent
performances are given by nearly everyone in the ﬁlm,
though the live-action parts are the weakest and much of that
is due to Lumley and Margolyes as the evil aunts. Paul Terry
is a good actor, though, and he rescues the end of the movie
with sheer enthusiasm. During the stop-motion middle of
the ﬁlm, the voices of the characters are provided by Susan
Sarandon as Miss Spider, Simon Callow as Old Green
Grasshopper, Frasier’s Glynis Johns as the Ladybug, David
Thewlis as Earthworm, Richard Dreyfuss as Caterpillar and
Margolyes as Glowworm. Sarandon, especially, adds a
mystery and menace remarkable for a completely vocal
performance. Dreyfuss is largely wasted. His awkward,
loud Brooklynaccent could have been done better by any
number of actors and come off as less annoying.

There is the sense, as well, that this is a very abridged,
musicalized version of Dahl’s book, and this is true.

It means that much of the delightful conversation from
the book is cut, minimizing the characterization of the bugs
and so a lot ofthe emotional impact. lt’s not a fatal flaw, but
it is a ﬂaw.

Also, there is a storytelling incompleteness: there should
probably have been one more big stop-motion adventure
episode to “round out” the structure. lfyou have not read the
book, you should probably see the ﬁlm ﬁrst and then

appreciate how much richerthe book is. If you have read the
book, do not hold the movie to the book’s strictures.

But what really stuns about James are the visuals. The
landscape is totally believable during the stop-motion seg-
ments (the live-action sets are less so). Combining com-
puter animation, blue-screen effects, stop-motion, and live-
action, James is sometimes blindingly good-looking. Where
it falls down is in trying to make the live-action setting recall
the stop-motion setting. Selick solves this problem by
ignoring it, to the detriment of the ﬁlm.

James ultimately is a success, but for reasons much
different than those which made Nightmare a success.
While it is true that James is much darker than the usual
children’s movie, it is nowhere near the dark vision of
Nightmare.

This film also succeeds largely in spite of its music, while
Nightmare was decidedly a musical. In the end, the two
films are so dissimilar that too much comparison is point-
less. This ﬁlm is Selick’s vision while Nightmare was
clearly Burton’s.

A couple of things to look for: one character from The
Nightmare Before Christmas does brieﬂy return, but it is not
nearly as cheesy as that little sentence makes it sound. And
stay after the credits: it’s not hard since Randy Newman’s
catchiest tune of the movie, “Good News,” is playing, and
there is a short live-action bit at the end of the movie which,
though not brilliant, is worth staying for since the ticket has
already been bought.

Wind ensemble travels
to Japan during break

BY JENNIFER MENDOCHA
PHI NEWS STAFF WRITER

What did you do over spring break?
Work on the tan in some tropical para-
dise? W&L’s Wind Ensemble, directed
by Dr. Barry Kolman, had the unique
opportunity to tour Kyushu, Japan. the
group played three concerts, and did a
lot of sight-seeing. Though a language
barrier existed for most Wind Ensemble
students and their host families, they
managed to bridge the gap by “commu-
nicating through music” (the immortal
words of W&L’s Computing Specialist
and tuba player, Stephen Cole).

Hapless members of the Wind En-
semble were thankful that Japanese
scholars Beth Arthur and Matt Socha
were able to utilize their language skills
to extricate the group from various pre-
dicaments. Socha commented, “I was
amazed by the generous special treat-
ment I received from people I’ve never
met, probably due to the fact that I was

eager to learn and use their language.”
He was “touched by the warmth of the
Japanese host families,” especially with

regard to their sensitivity in trying to-

make their American guests feel at
home. He also marveled that “school

children wanted to get their pictures

taken with us just because we were
Americans.”

Sophomore Jeremy Adams found
his host family very hospitable and
accomodating, although he, along with
many members of the group, expressed
a certain degree of frustration with the
ubiquity of meals based on fish. It
therefore came as no surprise that, on
the home trip, the pizza and french fry
vendors at the L.A. International Air-
port terminal did a booming business.

Rachel Goddu added that, “It was
a wonderful experience.” She was also
impressed that, after such a short stay,
the host families were able to display
sincere regret at the departure of their
American guests.

trong performances in the

S throwing events and the dis-

tance runs, not to mention a memory,
helped the Washington and Lee track
squads to solid ﬁnishes at the ODAC
Championship at Roanoke College on
Saturday.

The women’s team placed second

0 behind Lynchburg with a score of 62

and the men’s team ﬁnished third be-
hind Lynchburg and Bridgewater with
53 points at the meet.

The men started off slowly in the

1 sprints and hurdles, failing .to place in

the top two of any of the ﬁve events.
Senior Nick Polizzi placed twice in
the hurdling events, ﬁnishing ﬁfth in
the 110 meter high hurdles and third in

« the 400 meter hurdles.

The Generals fared much better in
the distance runs. Junior Sandy Hooper
breezed to victory in the 800 meter run
in a time of 1:57.61. Sophomore Tay-
lor Shultz ﬁnished behind Hooper with
a 2:00.33, good for third place.

Senior Brad Paye and sophomore
Jason Callen grabbed a second place
ﬁnish in the 1500 meter run and 5000
meter run, respectively. Paye ran a
time of4:05.10 in the 1500 and Callen
crossed the line in 16:03.46 in the
5000.

Both the 4x400 and the 4x100 relay
teams placed third for the Generals.

Freshman Marc Granger and
sophomore Omar Moneim teamed up

to give the Generals an impressive
showing in the throwing events.
Granger and Moneim ﬁnished one-
two in the shot put as Granger threw a
40-9 1/2 and Moneim recorded a 40-6
1/4 heave. Lynchburg’s Joe Bedard,
who placed in eight events, finished
third.

Moneim also picked up a fourth
place showing in the javelin and
Granger placed ﬁfth in the discus.

Senior Harris Morrison continued
to be a force in the pole vault as he
gave the men their final victory of the
day. Morrison vaulted a height of 13-
6, six inches better than runner—up
Mike Dickerson of Bridgewater.

On the women’s side, it was the
Natasha and Josephine show in the
distance runs. Freshman Natasha
Dorofeeva smashed the school record
in the 800 meter run with her time of
2:23.97, which was nearly five sec-
onds faster than the runner—up.

Senior Josephine Schaefferwas her
usual dominant self as she captured
both the 1500 and 3000 meter runs.
While she cruised to victory in the
3000, topping teammate Carson Flow-

ers with a time of 10:38.40, her ODAC-

record-breaking win in the 1500 of-
fered plenty of drama.

Schaeffer said she gets very
“stressed” each time she runs the 1500.

“It really isn’t my best race and it
takes a lot out of me mentally and
physically,” she said.

Accustomed to leading the pack
throughout most of her races, Schaeffer
found herself in the unlikely position

of playing catch—up as Lynchburg’s
Melissa Beaver passed her late in the
1500. With only about200 meters left
in herﬁnal ODAC Championship race,
Schaeffer knew it was time to put on
the burners. One thing was bothering
her, though.

Schaeffer said the scenario re-
minded her of her junior and senior
years in high school when she was
frustrated by an opposing runner she
encountered who always seemed to
pass her with about 200 meters left in
a race.

“That’s what was going through
my mind when [Beaver] passed me.”

But the senior would not continue
to let the memory haunt her. She
rallied to pass Beaver and win the race
with her record time of 4:55.40, more
than two seconds better than her
Lynchburg opponent.

“I was surprised at my kick,”
Schaeffer said. ‘‘I don’t know where it
came from, but it came from some-
where.”

Junior Nat Messmore also per-
formed admirably in the distance races,
finishing third in the 1500 and fourth
in the 3000.

Senior Hollis Leddy looked good
in the shorter distances, placing third
in the 200 meters in 27.73 and second
in the 400 meters in 1:02.52.

Despite his fantastic year for the Gener-

the the number-one singles position head-

The senior disposed of the number-two

W&L looks to capture eighth straight Lee-Jackson title *  

BY BETHANY BAUMAN
PHI SPORTS EDITOR

l he Washington and Lee

men’s lacrosse team hopes
to‘cap off its season with a win at
Saturday’s Lee-Jackson La-
crosse Classic against the
Keydets of the Virginia Military
Institute.

The Generals have been frus-
trated over the past few weeks.
They’ve lost three of their last
five games, including a triple
overtime 10-9 defeat by Denison
and an 12-11 overtime loss to
ODAC rival Roanoke College.

Last Saturday, 11th—ranked
W&L faced the 6th-ranked
Shoremen of Washington Col-
lege at Wilson Field.

Washington College cameout
strong, scoring early in the first

quarter. The Generals trailed 3-
1 until senior attack Ande
Jenkins scored early in the sec-
ond quarter.

The score stayed at 3-2 until
Washington ’s George Atterbury
and John Fuller scored goals in
the final 2:22 of the first half to
post a 5-2 Shoremen lead at half-
time.

Atterbury scored
Washington’s first two goals of
the second half, starting a 7-1
Shoremen run that left the Gen-
erals with a 10-3 deficit early in
the fourth quarter.

The Shoremen went on to
take the game 15-5.

But the Generals regrouped
before going into their last
ODAC game of the season
against the Yellow Jackets of
Randolph-Macon College on
Wednesday.

Senior attackman Russell
Croft led W&L, scoring four
goals to take the now 12th-
ranked Generals over Randolph-
Macon.

W&L netted the first four
goals of the game and was lead-
ing Randolph-Macon 11-1 be-
fore the Jackets scored three
straight in the third quarter.

The Generals got a lot of
help at goal from junior Chris
TeStrake, who made ten saves,
seven of them in the first half.

W&L moved to a 9-5 overall
record with the 15-6 win and
finished second in the ODAC at
5-1.

The Generals will conclude
their season by hosting VMI on
Saturday in the 9th Annual Lee-
Jackson Lacrosse Classic.

Senior Adam Butterworth
said, “lt's one of my favorite
games to play in...The fans re-
ally get into the rivalry.”

The first Lee-Jackson game
was played at Wilson Field in
1988 when the Generals fell to
the Keydets 15-9.

W&Lhassincewon all seven
Classics, but the games have be-
come increasingly competitive
over the past few years, with the
last two matchups decided by

three goals or less.

VMI head lacrosse coach
Doug Bartlett said that there
were only two things that he
could predict for Saturday; the
game will start at 2pm and he’ll
be celebrating after the game,
regardless of the Keydets’ per-
formance, because it will be his
daughter’s second birthday.

On the more serious side,
Bartlett hopes that the Keydets
will be able to overcome the
inconsistency that has plagued
the team during their 6-7 sea-
son.

Bartlett said, “We’ve got to
be able to put together the best
quarters of the different games
we’ve played this season.”

W&L head coach Jim
Stagnitta also hopes to have his
team finish off the season on a
positive note.

He would like to see the Gen-
erals shooting the ball better,
taking advantage of the offense
that they’ve been able to gener-
ate all season.

“There’s a lot of excitement
surrounding this game...and a
lot of incentive for the players.
You can throw the records out.”

There will be a new tradition
added to the Lee-Jackson Clas-

sic this year. A most valuable
player will be selected from each
team to be the recipients of the
Worrell-Fallon Memorial Award.

The award is named after
DeWitt Worrell and Gary Fallon,
two men who helped close the
gap between Washington and
Lee, VMI, and the community
before their tragic deaths.

Worrell was an outstanding
athlete, starring in football, bas-
ketball, and track at VMI.

After graduating in 1962, he
continued his involvement with
VMI, serving on the Keydet Club
Board of Governors and the Board
of Visitors. Worrell also acted as
an advisor to the VMI athletic
department.

Gary Fallon coached the Gen-
erals football program from 1978
until his death in April of 1995.

Fallon was a standout athlete
in football, wrestling, and lacrosse
for the Orangemen during his
career at Syracuse University.

After graduating in 1962, he
began a professional football ca-
reer with the Minnesota Vikings,
Hamilton Tiger Cats, and Toronto
Argonauts.

Fallon went back to Syracuse
to get his masters in special edu-
cation, and after graduating in

The Generals prevailed over the Keydets, 11-8, in last year’s
Lee-Jackson Lacrosse Classic, held at VMI.

1967, he began his coaching
career.

In 1978, Fallon arrived in
Lexington to coach the Gener-
als. During this time he was
also a top-rated lacrosse offi-
cial and worked several NCAA

playoff games.
In his sixteen years at W&L,
Fallon accumulated the

winningest record in Generals
football history, and more im-
portantly, had a lasting impres-

who played for him.

The inscription on the plaque
reads, “This award honors the
memory of DeWitt Worrell

(VMI ‘62) and Gary Fallon .

(W&L Football Coach 1978-
95)—Men deeply dedicated to
their families, their faith, their
universities, the game of la-

‘crosse, the constant pursuit of

excellence, and the Lexington
community in which they lived
and to which they contributed so

sion on the hundreds of men significantly.”

poor excuse for a sports analyst.

The Generals havejust com-
pleted a superb season, going
16-11 overall with a stellar 1 1-5
record in the ODAC. All these
improvements are the mark ofa
team with a mission.

While all the collegians were
at the beach, on vacation orjust
living it up on spring break, the
Generals compiled a 4-2 record
during their April 13-21 hiatus.

The team travelled north to

Maryland April 14th to play St.
Mary’s College in an afternoon
doubleheader. The Generals
dropped the first game but took
the second behind the pitching
of Bob Weston.

Two days later, the Generals

Women sweep all nine
events for first time in
ODAC history to win
sixth straight tennis title

BY JASON ZACHER
PHI STAFF WRITER

I he W&L women’s tennis team swept the ODAC tournament
last weekend, not dropping a set en route to their sixth straight
ODAC title.

Led by ODAC Player of the Year, Natalia Garcia, the Generals
completed the first perfect sweep of all nine events in ODAC
history.

Garcia captured the No. 1 singles title 6-2, 6-1 over Guilford
College’s Betsey Parker.

She was followed by sophomores Ericka Shapard and Berry
Blankinship in the No. 2 and No. 3 slots. Shapard defeated
Guilford’s Libby Hinsley 6-0, 7-6 and Blankinship took down
Mignon Ezzell 6-4, 7-5.

Senior Shelley Sunderman did not drop a game as she picked up
her fourth ODAC title 6-0, 6-0 over Guilford’s Jen Wolos.

Senior Julie Ayers captured her third straight ODAC title as she
defeated Sarah Woodard 6-0, 6-4.

Freshman Mary Celeste Foster followed suit and won her first
ODAC singles title.

In doubles action, the Generals continued to dominate. The No.
1 team of Ayers and Garcia won in straight sets, as did the No. 2
team of Shapard and Blankinship, and the No. 3 team of Foster and

Sunderman.

Next week, the Generals head to Kalamazoo, Michigan to
compete in the NCAA Division III Tournament.

The Generals have the fourth seed, and will play Sewanee in the
first round. The Generals defeated Sewanee 6-3 during the regular

season.

Baseball prepares for first
ODAC tourney in five years

Despite the defeat, the Gener-
als remained in the hunt for an
ODAC playoff berth. The team
ventured to Greensboro, NC to
challenge the dwellers of the
ODAC cellar, Guilford College
in two key games on April 21st.

Backed by the pitching of
Ermigiotti, Weston and the clutch
relief performances of closer Matt
Reedy, the Generals took two
from the Quakers. 9-3 and 8-7.
Now,the Generalscould consider
themselve serious contenders for
a trip to Lynchburg City Stadium
for the playoffs.

Tuesday the 23rd, the Gener-
als invaded Harrisonburg to chal-
lengethe Eastern Mennonite Roy-
als for the fourth seed in the
ODAC tournament. A one-hour
rain delay only prolonged the
agony for the Royals who fell to
the Generals 7-4. Rob Boston
went the distance for the victory.

Last Thursday, the high-pow-
ered offense of Lynchburg settled
into Smith Field to keep their
ODAC tournament hopes alive.
But, the Generals had no sympa-
thy for the Hornets, defeating
them 14-1.

Matt Ermigiotti continued his
superb pitching to move to 6-2 on
the year, tyingthe team record for
victories. At this point, the Gen-

erals were playoff-bound.
Finally, Sunday saw the ar-

rival of the Randolph-Macon
