WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

 

Eighteen Washington and Lee students
drank beer last night at a party with a band.
What’s so different about that? The answer
is that they were part of a controlled drink-
ing experiment last night in the Gencral

Headquarters restaurant.

Each participant was to drink beer and
have his blood alcohol content (B.A.C.)

measured after each one. They were to

15 minutes between each beer. Each partici-
pant was encouraged to stop drinking when

he thought he had had enough.

Roger Sullivan, who was in charge of
the experiment, said ‘‘we called fraternities
and sororities to get some names of pcople

to participate.”’

The participants were divided into three

groups to show the effects on each.

One group was not to eat dinner or

wait

snacks before the experiment, a second was

. to eat dinner and no snacks, and the third
and have

was to eat dinner beforehand
snacks during the evening.

All of the participants had a good time.
Some, like seniors Steve Erwin and Alan

Pierce, even had contests to determine

would be more sober at the end of the

evening.

‘They chose me for my expertise,’
Pierce, who was in the group that
dinner but no snacks. ‘‘I should have
in the snack group.”’

Both the participants and onlookers

entertained by ‘‘Lost in the Supermarkct.”’

The results of the experiment

generally as one might. expect. Most of

those who had food in their stomachs gener-

ally fared better than those who did not.
There were some minor problems, how-

ever.

EC discovers $16,000 surplus

 

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

 

The Executive Committee last
night realized that last year’s surplus
of more than $16,000 has not been
allocated in the 1990-91 student orga-
nization budgets.

The EC voted final approval last
night for the allocation of $185,250
in student activities fees. That total,
however, does not include the 1989-
90 surplus, which totals with interest
$16,216, EC Vice President Raymond
Welder said.

Welder said a student body re-
serve of almost $30,000 in 1988-89
led him to believe it was customary

‘‘Everything’s fine. I have a little gas,
though,”’ said Erwin.

Sergeant A.M. Miller of the Lexington
Police Department was present to administer
the breathalyzer tests on the participants. He
said several of the tests may have been
more inaccurate than usual because of the
limitations of the ‘‘Alka-Senser’’ devices.

“The ideal way to conduct this experi-
ment would be to have each person have
their own alkalyzer,"’ Miller said. ‘‘That

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

KA given
of probat

 

By Courtney Hall
Staff Reporter

 

The Student Affairs Committee met Oct. 5
to determine the fate of W&L’s Kappa Alpha
chapter without one member of that chapter
being present.

SAC reviewed the case after it had passed
through the hands of both the KA Housing
Corporation and the Inter-Fraternity Council,
and decided to put the KA house on ‘‘critical
probation’’ for the remainder of the academic
year.

KA President Niko Lorenzatos said that he
was not pleased with the way SAC handled the
case, :

“TI think in cases where SAC reviews
incidents of this nature, the house accused
should be present,’’ Lorenzatos said. ‘‘That’s
ridiculous.”’

The house was punished for damage done
to ic on Tear Night, the night freshmen accept
their bids to join the fraternity. Associate Dean
of Students for Greek Affairs Leroy ‘‘Buddy’’
Atkins said that it looked like they were
celebrating by punching holes, ‘‘lots of holes,”’
in the walls and ceiling of the fraternity house.

According to Dean of Students David
Howison, both the KA Housing Corporation and
the IFC took strong action. Howison said that
the Housing Corporation levied a series of fines
on the house, place them on an extended
conduct probation, and required them to get a
resident manager, or ‘‘house mother,’’ by
January, 1991.

IFC approved of the KA _ Housing
Corporation’s action, and added a six-week term
of social probation.

SAC then reviewed this case. Howison
said that KA’s presence at the meeting wasn’t
necessary because SAC was ‘‘dealing with facts
that had already been determined, meaning the
action taken “by ‘the Housing Corporation and

OCTOBER 18, 1990

year
on

Howison said SAC’s role was simply to
determine the fraternity’s status on campus.
He said that options included expulsion,
suspension, or critical probation. SAC unani-
mously voted to place KA on critical probation
for the rest of the academic year.

Howison explained that the terms of
probation are still to be worked out, but that it
essentially means that SAC will suspend
W&L’s KA chapter for a minimum of five
years if they commit another serious violation
of The Standards for Behavior for Fraternities.

In a letter to Lorenzatos, SAC explained
the consequences of the suspension.

‘If suspended, KA would vacate the
fraternity house and would not be permitted to
participate, directly or indirectly, in any aspect
of university life. Furthermore, the fraternity
would have no right to appeal for re-
colonization at W&L until the five-year period
of suspension had passed.’

Lorenzatos called the decision unfair. He
said that SAC was ‘‘acting in the best interest
of the fraternities as a whole. Things like this
incident should not be allowed to happen. It’s
just the way they came to this decision that is
flawed.”’

Howison said that if the fraterrnity violates
the terms of critical probation, there will be a
hearing where the KA chapter and Housing
Corporation will be allowed to present their
case to the SAC.

‘‘All of us on the committee want KA to
succeed. They have an extraordinary history
at W&L. We want to work together to be
successful,’ said Howison.

Lorenzatos said that he attempted to meet
with SAC last Friday to discuss the issue of
KA’s lack of representation in the decision-
making process, but not enough members came
to provide quarum. He is now in the midst of
composing a formal letter of complaint against
the decision. :

 

to hold over the previous year’s
surplus in reserve. This year’s EC
based its allocations on matriculation
figures without the surplus in mind.

EC President Tom Hatcher said
the EC would consider how to handle
the surplus at Monday’s meeting. He
re-emphasized, though, that all orga-
nizations are welcome to return to the
EC to request additional funding.

At Monday’s meeting, the EC
received a memo from Dean of Stu-
dents David L. Howison to the Wash-
ington and Lee community outlining
the make-up and procedures of the
Confidential Review Committee.

“‘One of my major goals when it
comes to the CRC is to increase the
awareness of the student body,”’

Howison said yesterday, explaining
the purpose of his memo.

‘‘There is a great deal of confu-
sion about the CRC,’’ Welder said
last night. ‘‘Many believe that its
matters could be handled by the’’
Student Conduct Committee ‘‘and the
American legal system.’’

Howison said the goal of the
CRC process would be ‘to have
complaints resolved at the first level
to the satisfaction of all involved.
Only if there cannot be resolution at
that level would the CRC act on the
case. |

Hatcher said he and Howison are
considering an open forum where
students can ask questions of CRC
members and discuss the issue.

Freshman EC Rep. Ashby Hack-
ney joined the EC Monday night to
make the first full 1990-91 EC meet-
ing. Hackney defeated challenger
Ames Hutton for the position, 138-
132. Freshmen elected Bill Chappell
and Blair Lee Hixson to the class
presidency and vice presidency, re-
spectively, in last Thursday’s run-offs.

The EC is currently accepting
letters of interest for students wishing
to serve on the Athletic, Faculty
Executive, Library Advisory and
Student Health committees, as well as
freshmen and law students wishing to
serve on the Cold Check Committee.
Interviews begin Monday at 5 p.m.
Students may sign up for times out-
side the EC office.

Hill to charge Greeks up to $400

 

By Pamela Kelly

Washington and Lee will soon charge the
approximately 80 percent of its students who are
fraternity or sorority members a Greek Member

The fee stems from terms of the university's

about $11 million in renovations on the houses of

SAC to drop role as appellate body

 

By Jason Kelley
Senior Copy Editor

 

The Student Affairs Committee
will become more a_ policy-making
board and less an appellate body if
members and the faculty approve a
plan to change the SAC's responsi-
bilities.

Dean of Students David Howison
said SAC wants to concentrate on the
broader issues facing students rather
than spend its time ruling on appeals
from various judicial boards.

“It wants to get out of its schizo-
phrenic role of having to deal with
both appeals and policy-making,”’
Howison said.

SAC, made up of five students,
three faculty members and two ad
ministrators, has had the
overturn the rulings of various judi
cial boards on campus such as the
Interfraternity Council and the Stu
dent Conduct Committee

power lo

It has also made recommendations
on policy changes to the faculty, such
as a proposal two years ago to move
Fraternity Rush to winter term.

SAC has drawn up an outline that
redefines its powers and responsibili-
ties. After a series of student forums,
the committee will vote on the final
version of the proposed policy
changes, Howison said. If approved,
the plans will be presented to the
faculty for final approval, possibly as
early as November.

If the new rules go into effect,
each student regulating body would
make up their own appellate process,
which would most likely include
administration officials

Howison said, however, the ad
ministrators will not have the power
to overturn student board decisions. If
the administrators think the board has
made a wrong decision, they will
only be able to ask the board to re
its decision

‘If I disagree with an SCC rul

View

ing, I can recommend review. But if
they say they’re not going to change
their ruling, I have to live with that,”’
Howison said. ‘‘We want to give
more autonomy to the — student
groups.”’

According to IFC President Good-
loe Lewis, the IFC plans to have
Associate Dean of Students for Greek
Affairs Leroy ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins han-
dle its appeals.

Howison said appeals from the
Student Conduct Committee would
most likely come to him.

‘“*But,’’ Howison said, ‘‘these are
the sort of things that students should
decide for themselves. They can
regulate their own actions.’’

Howison said the SAC thought
there were too many rules and reg-
ulations being enforced by the boar-
ds.

He said each student judicial
group should simplify its regulations
and base its rules on greater trust in
the integrity of the students.

“‘T would encourage the councils
to simplify their rules and regula-
tions,’’ he said.

Howison said SAC has long been
considering such changes, but when
the committee had to spend its entire
first meeting of the year hearing
Rush violation appeals, they decided
to act.

According to the proposal, SAC
would have four functions under the
new rules.

The new SAC would enforce the
university's new Standards for Frater-
nities, review all Student Conduct
Committee recommendations for sus
pension or expulsion of a student,
serve as a university forum for dis-
cussion and debate of important stu
dent issues, and recommend non
curricular policy changes to the facul
ty.

The new Standards for Fraternities
regulate how fraternity members can
use their houses, They include reg
ulations on sanitary standards, lease

conditions and house employees.

Howison said if SAC found out
that a fraternity had broken the Stan-
dards, SAC would have only three
options under the new rules: expel
the chapter from campus, suspend it
for five years, or place it on ‘‘critical
probation’ for a year.

He explained that a chapter on
“critical probation’’ must follow the
Standards exactly or it will be sus-
pended from campus.

Under the proposed rules, SAC
would review but not overtum SCC
student suspensions or expulsions.

The other two functions of SAC
under the proposed changes, serving
as a student-issues forum and recom-
mending changes to the faculty, are
what the committee feels it is best
suited for, Howison said.

‘‘Frankly,’’ he said, ‘‘there are
just too many rules. We should have
fewer rules. We've got to get a sys-
tem that is based on honor and
trust

 
 

OPINION

Opportunism
at Dartmouth

Dartmouth College, or at least various members of that
school’s community, are waging what amounts to little more
than a smear campaign against The Dartmouth Review.

You have probably heard what has happened to the
Review, but here is the condensed version, just in case. In
an issue that appeared on Yom Kippur, one of the holiest
days in the Jewish faith, the Review somehow managed to
print a quote from Adolf Hitler, which maintained that the
extermination of the Jews is God’s own work. Ugly stuff,
that.

As a reasonable person might have imagined,
condemnations rained down on the Review from almost
every segment of society. The magazine’s editor and several
staffers resigned in the face of enormous pressure.

However, the strongest criticism has come from the
Dartmouth administration, led by university President James
Freedman, who spoke at this year’s Washington and Lee
senior convocation in September. Freedman, who has been
locked in a blood feud with the Review for years, has
evidently seen this as an opportunity to gain the upper hand
over the conservative magazine.

Review staffers have claimed that the quote is a work of
sabotage from an unknown person. However reluctant one
might be about this explanation, it is equally clear that the
Review deserves at least some of the benefit of the doubt.
Despite this, Freedman has seen fit to unleash a barrage
against the Review, without as much as speaking to any one
staff member, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Dartmouth’s attempts to muzzle the Review, as well as
many of its staff, are well-documented. Dartmouth’s seeming
unwillingness to get to the bottom of the matter sounds
disturbingly like the administration is making the most of
what it sees as a rare opportunity.

The Review, however, can hardly be called completely
innocent in this battle of wills. Even the Journal has seen
fit to refer to some of the Review’s work ‘‘sophomoric.”’

Regardless of the quality of some of its work, the Review
deserves a chance to find out exactly what happened.
Equally important is that we are given a chance to appraise
the Review by how it responds to these most trying times.

That is, if Dartmouth will allow that to happen.

Sports the way
they ought to be

About a hour north on Interstate 64 from here is the
Number 1 Football Team in America, the University of
Virginia Cavaliers.

Although the relative merits of this lofty ranking are none
of our concern, we wish to commend UVa’s success at the
difficult task of combining big-time athletics and big-time
academics. That’s something that cannot be said for many
of the schools currently pursuing UVa. It’s refreshing to
watch a football game on TV, where the players’ listed
majors are ‘‘Business Administration.’’ rather than
‘Recreation Management.’’ Where the athletes are more
concemed with passing their midterms than their next urine
test. Where the players are more concerned with being
academically capable rather than criminally culpable.

The challenge for UVa and schools like it is equally
difficult, however. For many, the temptation to continue
athletic superiority can lead to bending the rules in
admissions. We hope that UVa will not be so ruthless and
opportunistic.

We wish the Wahoos all the luck in the world for the
rest of the season, because we fear they’re going to need it.
Business majors are nice, but accounting won’t beat
Oklahoma or Miami, or whomever they should meet in a
New Year’s Day Bowl Game.

Besides, if they should win it all, there’s going to be one
impressive party in Charlottesville in January.

A necessary measure:

Congress moves to strengthen FHA requirements

 

MY VIEW
By Chris Baradel

 

You may not have noticed it, with
all the controversy surrounding the
budget deficit, but Congress showed
an uncommon amount of political
will recently by proposing a measure
that could forestall the bankruptcy of
a major government agency.

Congressional committees crafted
a bill that should allow the troubled
Federal Housing Administration’s
mortgage insurance fund to remain
financially solvent. That's not so
unusual. What is praiseworthy about
their effort (which congressional
leaders say should result in definite
passage of the bill) is that they
withstood fierce pressure from
lobbying groups in order to do what
is best for an overwhelming majority
of Americans.

The legislature and
Department of Housing and Urban
Development had _ been trying
desperately to come up with an

the

agreement that would shore up the
FHA.

The problem was, a battle royal
sprung forth among HUD Secretary
Jack Kemp, Senate conferees and
House conferees, all of whom had

their own ideas about how to best
balance the needs of home buyers
with the responsibility of the
government to keep the FHA fund
solvent.

borrowers and adding an additional
premium on FHA loans. This, he felt,
was the only way to stem the recent
tide of defaults and guarantee the
solvency of the FHA home mortgage
insurance fund.

However, the mortgage industry
and consumer groups joined in a
highly unusual alliance to pressure
Congress to come up with an
alternate plan. The coalition’s rational
was that insufficient numbers of low-
and middle-income home buyers
would be able to get FHA loans
under the Kemp proposal.

Two congressmen, Bruce Vento
and Thomas Ridge, came up with a
much milder plan to help the FHA.
Their plan called for reducing up-
front. costs for borrowers, while
slightly increasing their monthly
premiums. Kemp flatly stated that
this plan would not do nearly enough
to save the FHA, which had lost $4.2
billion in 1988.

The compromise bill combines the
best parts of both plans. It assesses
borrowers a small annual premium,
but allows them to finance over half

of the up-front closing costs.
Basically, it means that FHA loan
recipients will pay about 25% more
up-front closing costs than they do
now.

These additional closing costs will
not prohibit a staggering number of
home-buyers from affording FHA
loans; what it will do is limit
recipients to. those who are serious
about trying to pay for a new house.
The new plan will increase the stake
people have in their FHA loans, and
as Kemp noted, people with a greater
stake in their investment are less
likely to default on their loans.

Large numbers of people
defaulting on their FHA !oans is the
biggest single reason why the fund is
threatened with insolvency. Although
consumer groups call the new bill a
‘*bitter pill to swallow,’’ we must
commend our legislators for standing
up to the consumer groups prejudiced °
rhetoric.

Any taxpayer could tell you that
footing the bill for a possible multi-
billion dollar FHA bailout would be
a much more noxious pill to swallow.

Cadaver signs
are nuisances

Attention editors,
ladies and gentlemen:
I am a janitor at W&L, not a custodian (a

custodian washes his/her hands after cleaning the .

commodes).

I would like to address the secret and secre-
tive Cadaver Society. Just how do you address a
secret society? I don’t know. It’s a secret. Never-
theless, perhaps this letter will have as much
dubious impact as your tacky signs.

At best, they are a minor hindrance — at
worst, campus litter.

The point is lost on us. You sneak around in
the wee hours to pul up signs that, in many
cases, only the janitors see. Boorishly clever,
boys.

For reasons that I’m sure only you can
fathom, I (like you) must remain —

Secretly anonymous.

Athletic Supporters,

On behalf of the football team and coaching
staff I'd like to send out my greatest appreciation
to those members of the student body and faculty
who have chosen, for the first time in my five
years here, to stay at the football games through
their entirety. Your cheers and support have been
excellent,

Like you, we were unhappy with the results
of the first two home games. as you can see, we
did not get discouragea and thumped a pretty

 

LETTERS

good Hampden-Sydney team last week. Although
your support has been excellent, we ask that you
refrain from using profanity or throwing things at
out opponents, their fans or cheerleaders. The
best fans are those that cheer for their team, not
against their opponent.

Again, I thank you and encourage everyone to
attend the last three home games, as well as
attending all other W&L sports contests.

Generali Yours,
Coach Russell Crosby

P.S. — Thanks to FIJI and Phi Delta Theta for
their inventive and encouraging cheers.

Undergrads
already treat
law students

Mr. S.D. Buchanan wrote last week that the
undergraduates should treat the law students to
Fancy Dress because the law school is officially
on break. Perhaps Mr. Buchanan doesn’t realize
it, but the undergraduates already treat the law
students to a helluva lot more than the equivalent
of a $40 Fancy Dress ticket. This year the
Executive Committee has announced that it plans
to allot the Student Bar Association $35,000 of
the $36,575 that law students contributed to the
Student Activities Fund. That strikes me as
insane!

Each W&L student pays $95 a year in stu-
dent activities fees for the funding of campus-
wide services and organizations. The Student Bar
Association is receiving all but $1,575 that the
law students added to the fund; they are using
the allotment fore their own organizations and
programs which solely serve the law school.

ee

The undergraduates are fully financing the
Student Activities Board, Contact and the W&L
Publications Board among other entities of which
both campuses can take advantage. Meanwhile,
the law school is enjoying roughly a $20,000 a
year social budget. I’m sorry Mr. Buchanan, but
the undergraduates have already provided you
with the likeness of a $40 FD ticket, and more.

Sincerely,
Mike Skarda, ’91

Display lacks
taste and
effectiveness

To the directors of Alcohol Awareness Weck:

As a person who has lost a friend in an
alcohol-related accident, I find the repulsive
window display in the Co-op truly offensive. |
wholeheartedly agree with the principle behind
such alcohol awareness messages, but find this
one lacking not only in taste, but in effectiveness
as well. Surely there is a more appropriate way
to convey the seriousness of the consequences of
drunk driving than to centerpiece the flip phrase
‘Don't get smashed’’ with a bloodied, smashed
windshield.

I think the only response you could have
hoped to stimulate is an occasional ‘‘oh, gross’’
from a student who catches sight of it as he is
about to bite into a Chicken Filet.

I am convinced there is a way to get people’s
attention while dealing with the sensitivity of this
issue to provoke thought and positive response,
if this is a trial-and-error process, consider this to
have been your error. Please try harder next time,

Sincerely,
Courtney B. Hall, '92

’ If the only good thing you can re-
member about WREL’s programming
‘is the commercials, you may be
, pleasently surprised upon tuning in to
96.7 FM.
What was once home to ‘‘ele-
+ Vator music’’ has now turned to clas-
sic rock, according to Mitch Neu-
rock, a second year law student at
, Washington and Lee who has his
own show wecknights from 6-10 p.m.
Those who tune in Monday
. through Friday evenings, as well as
from 10 p.m.-5 a.m., when a pre-
‘ recorded program by Neurock is
, aired, are likely to hear tunes by Led
Zepplin, Fleetwood Mac, The Doors,
* Living Colour and INXS.
j “IT try to play more of the new
stuff,’’ said Neurock.
This especially holds true for
y: Thursday and Friday, when ‘‘people
are starting to cut loose,’’ he ex-
‘plained, ‘‘and you want the music to
. Teflect that.’’
Neurock’s program also features a
* request hour from 9-10 p.m. when he
, can be reached at 463-7773.
The limits on program selection
, are broad, according to WREL’s
youngest regular disc jockey. ‘‘Rap is

This change in music selection

’ reflects the station’s movement to

attract more sponsors and lisieners,
according to Neurock.

“‘WREL is coming out of the
closet,’’ he joked. ‘‘It wants to be a
part of the community and acknow-
ledge student influence.’’

In addition, 96.7 FM is increas-
ing its power to 25 kilowatts, enabl-
ing it to reach other colleges in
Staunton and Waynesboro.

Attempts by the station to achieve
more visibilty have led to a col-
laboration with the local United Way
chapter in their annual fund raising
drive, according to Neurock.

The afternoon of "riday, Oct. 19,
marks the ascention of Neureck to
the roof of a Lexington building
(possibly El Cafe) in order to broad-
cast his show live. He will remain
there until the contribution goal is
met.

‘Realistically, I hope to be done
in under 24 hours,’’ he said.

He also hopes that the $177,000
goal will be subsidized to a large
extent by fraternities and sororities
matching each others donations.

But money isn’t the only contri-
bution Neurock is looking for. ‘‘Hot
coffee will be welcomed, also.’’

According to W&L Treasurer
Lawrence Broomall, Jr. the Member
Fee is a non-negotiable attempt by
the university to recover some of the
costs of what he called system-wide
corrections from all greeks.

‘‘That has nothing to do with

whether they’re applying to the
university for financing of their
physical renovation. There is a

standard fee charged to all members
of Greek organizations as a greck
system wide fee and the university
will use the proceeds of that to help
with its costs for the physical
renovation.”

‘The Renaissance involves more
than the physical renovation of the
buildings. It involves compliance with
social, as well as physical fraternity
standards. The renovations are one
larger part of the program,’’ he said.

According to Broomall the
university considers all Greeks
Renaissance program participants
because all must conform to the new
university standards. He cited a
document labelled ‘‘Standards for

Fraternities’ in which the university
outlined conditions to be upheld by

all fraternities.

Conditions included interior and
extcrior physical standards, the hiring
of resident non-student managers, and
the utilization of the university billing
and collection program.

Broomall said fraternity compli-
ance with the guidelines is‘‘not a
matter of choice.’’ If the university
demands are not met by fraternities,
their charters could be revoked.

Mary Greeks have  expressei
concems over the impending fee.
Panhellenic President Nancy Mitchell
said there must have been a lack of
communication because she wasn’t
farailiar with the fee until three
wecks ago. Broomall said the concept
has been around almost two years,
but most Greeks probably found out
only recently.

Mitchell said she heard worries
that some Greeks can’t afford the fee,
or it may deter freshmen form rush-
ing. Broomall and Atkins think the
fees won’t have much impact on
individuals and some houses, like
those in the Renaissance program
who will no longer pay mortgages,
land rent, or property taxes, may end
up paying less than in previous years.

Other gripes included the lack of
sorority representation on the Student
Affairs Committee. Some Grecks also
think independents should be charged
because they attend many fraternity
functions.

NEWS

W&L foresees
housing change

 

By Gregory Patterson
Staff Reporter

In the midst of debate about
Washington and Lee students occupy-
ing too many residences in the low-
income areas of Lexington, college
officials say the number of students
living in the community may be
declining and are working to reduce
it even more.

Frank Parsons, university coor-
dinator of facility planning, says he
thinks the number of students living
in the Diamond Hill section of town
is decreasing.

‘‘Last year, there were several
student addresses that were clearly in
[that] area,’’ said Parsons, who is in
charge of keeping student address
records.

A June 17 New York Times article
concerning the housing situation in
Lexington quoted the number of
students living in the low-income area
as 137. The article estimated the total
number of residents in the necigh-
borhood to be about 500.

Parsons said there were at least
five on the list of student addresses
last year ‘‘clearly’’ in the low-
income neighborhood that ‘‘did not
turn up this year.’’

Parsons said that while there may
be a few undiscovered new students
in that area, he believes there are less
students in the neighborhood than last
year.

Dean of Students David Howison
agreed with Parsons. He said the
student housing situation in the city
should improve in the next few years
for a number of reasons.

One of Howison’s priorities is to
increase the level of occupancy in
university's upperclass housing facil-
ities, Gaines Hall and Woods Creek
Apartments. He said he would like to
see them at 95 percent capacity and
is working on how to achieve that
goal.

Howison also said that two other
factors should help to decrease the
number of students housed in the
community. First, Fraternity Renais-
sance is increasing the number of
people able to live in fraternity
houses. Howison said it is the univer-
sity’s ‘‘expectation that houses will
be filled to capacity.”’

In addition, Howison said the
university’s decision to limit the size
of each academic class to just under
400 will reduce the total number of
students at W&L, significantly reduc-
ing the need for student housing in
the community.

JMU station applies
for antenna in Lex

 

By Tracey Thornblade
Staff Reporter

WMRA-FM in Harrisonburg has
filed an application with the Federal
Communication Commission to install
an antenna in Lexington.

Brenda Hanke of WMRA-FM said
if the appplication is approved, the
public radio station could begin
broadcast in Lexington within two
years.

The antenna, to be placed on top
of Nichols Engineering Building at

_ Virginia Military Institute, would cost
- $25,000. The station has already
» committed some money to the pro-
+ ject. The station will raise the balance
' through fundraising and loans.

The expansion operation began
last year after Hanke joined WMRA.
Hanke said she knew there were
listeners in Lexington. However, since
the city is located in a mountainous
area, reception is not clear. The new
antenna will allow all Lexington
residents and some Rockbridge Coun-
ty listeners to pick up a clearer sig-
nal.

WMRA is a _ professionally-run
station operated by James Madison
University. Its programming includes
syndicated news programs, classical
and bluegrass music and special pro-
gramming.

Robert deMaria, W&L journalism
professor, said that the new station
would not affect WLUR’s program-
ming.

Lenfest completion

 

date moved again |

By Chris Bray
Staff Reporter

The Lenfest Center, Washington
and Lee’s new center for the per-
forming arts, is once again experienc-
ing delays, according to the univer-
sity’s Coordinator of Capital Planning
Frank Parsons.

Although the official opening date
has not changed, Parsous says Lenfest
will not be finished until December.

‘At a job conference held last
weck, the Bass Construction Com-
pany indicated work would continue
into December,”’ said Parsons. ‘‘The
goal of completion for Lenfest is now
Christmas break.’’

However, the building should be
ready for occupancy before December
and the target date for the Drama
Department taking over Lenfest re-
mains Nov. 1, said Parsons.

The major cause of delay in the
past was said to have been con-

struction of the gatchouse, but Par-
sons says work remains to be com-
pleted throughout the structure.

Parsons explained delays occurring
closer to completion are the most
difficult to overcome.

“In a major building project,
things will come up to effect the
schedule,’’ he said. ‘‘When problems
arise in the final stages of construc-
tion, there is little time to absorb
delays.”’

Although the $9.8 million dollar

project was originally scheduled to
open in April, 1990, Parsons feels the #
finished product will be worth the 4
wait.

“When Lenfest is finished it’s *
going to be magnificent,’’ said Par-
sons. “‘It’s first rate construction.
The Bass Company is doing an ex- ¢
cellent job.’’

The first production in Lenfest,
Skin of Our Teeth by Thornton Wil- *

der, is scheduled to open Jan. 18, y
1990,

Speaker warns against
dangers of alcoholism

 

By Nikki Magazine
Staff Reporter

Dr. Will Keim addressed members of the Wash-
ington and Lee community and officially began Na-
tional Collegiate Alcohol Awareness Week on Monday
in Lee Chapel.

His speech, focusing on ‘‘The Development of
Character,’ covered topics of interest to the many stu-
dents, faculty and fraternity pledges present.

‘People should say what they mean, do what they
say and when they don’t, admit it,’’ pleaded Dr. Keim
in reference to the many problems alcohol causes and
the frequent self-denial among college students.

Because this is the first generation of college
students whose degrees will not guarantee jobs, Dr.
Keim maintains that there is no time in college life to
drink away weekends.

Stating statistics, such as two-thirds of sexually
abused women are raped by men they knew who were
under the influence of alcohol, 64 percent of homicides
and 41 percent of assaults are alcohol related and
alcohol is the number one killer of men and women
between the ages of 18 and 24, Keim emphasized that
much control is needed when dealing with the drug.

With five drinks or more at one time classified as

“binge drinking’’ by the Mayo Clinic, and with many
students at W&L drinking more than that in a typical
weekend night, people must learn to ‘‘drink respon-
sibly or abstain.”’

A Greek-affiliated man himself, Dr. Keim pointed
out that ‘‘people at parties and in classes are human
beings, not objects to be used.’ Excessive alcohol
often leads to unwanted or forced sex, which has
devastating consequences such as pregnancy or AIDS.

According to Dr. Keim, ‘‘Three ways to be
sexually responsible are to use a condom, use a
condom and use a condom, and if you are sober,
you’ll remember to put it on and make a responsible
decision.”’

Although movies and television seem to harmlessly
affiliate alcohol with basically everything from sports
to sex, Keim proclaimed that the stakes are too high to
abuse alcohol and sex in real life.

Students at W&L made a solemn pledge not to lie,
cheat or steal, and Dr. Keim applicd these vows by
asking students to not lie to themselves about what
they are doing, to not cheat themselves out of the best
years of their lives and to not steal opportunities from
themselves by excessively using alcohol.

Dr. Keim concluded his effective oratory by wish-
ing that every W&L student leave this campus with a
diploma and self-esteem.

Volunteers build for poor

Habitat for Humanity helps Lexington needy

 

By Jennifer Mayo
Staff Reporter

 

If you have walked down Massie
Street recently, you have probably
seen a ‘‘Help Wanted’’ sign in front
of lot 306, the construction site for a
new house being constructed by the
Rockbridge Area Habitat for Hu-
manity Organization under board
president Jim Williams.

Habitat for Humanity is an inter-
national organization of volunteers
who devote their time and energy to
less fortunate people of their com-
munity by raising funds through
donations to purchase vacant lots and
build homes to be sold at affordable
prices to families of low income.

The Rockbridge chapter was or-
ganized in January of 1989, and local
architect Lee Merrill is responsible
for designing the home, the organiza-

tion’s first project in the Lexington
and Buena Vista area.

Dorothy Cecil, who works on the
Family Selection committee, says that
the families who apply for homes are
carefully screened through interviews
and investigations of financial back-
grounds. ‘‘They must be able to pay
twenty-five percent of their income,
but we also have a ceiling limit to
ensure that the house is going to
someone who really needs it,’’ Cecil
explained.

Some familiar W&L faces, both
professors and students, as well as
VMI cadets and Southern Seminary
students, are involved in both the
organization and manual labor of the
project.

Proffessor and Mrs. Westbrook
Barrett work on the Site and Selec-
tion Committee. Co-fotnders of an
earlier area project, the Rockbridge
Presbyterian Home for ‘children,

which is now the Seven Hills Bed
and Breakfast, they enjoy involvement
in community service.

‘Lexington is a highly committed
community,’ Mrs. Barrett com-
mented, ‘‘and we love student invol-
vement. We are grateful for all the
help they are willing to contribute.’’

Both Pi Kappa Alpha and Chi Psi
Fraternities have been involved on the
work site, as well as Warren Ham-
monds and the Baptist Student Union.

W&L students Andrew Tucker
and Ben Weinstein are trying to stir
interest to develop a collegiate chap-
ter. ‘‘Many colleges are already run-
ning their own chapters. I would love
to see Washington and Lee on that
list,’’ stated Tucker.

If anyone is interested in joining
such an organization or getting more
information, call Andrew Tucker at
464-5549 or Ben Weinstein at 464-
5586.

Spectator editor works
on national college paper

 

By Alisann McGloin
Staff Reporter

Editor-in-Chief of The Wash-
ington and Lee Spectator Paul La-
garde has been named to the staff of
a new national, conservative publica-
tion for college students.

While Lagarde was working last
summer for Policy Review Magazine,
a quarterly put out by the The Heri-
tage Foundation, a ‘‘think-tank’’ in
Washington, D.C., he was asked by
the student editor-in-chief of Cam-
pus: America’s Student Newspaper to
join the staff as a student editor.

According to the publishers, Ca-
mpus: America’s Student Newspaper
is the only national, student-edited,
student-written publication for college
students. It is published four times
during the academic year by the

Intercollegiate Studies Institute.

Each issue of Campus includes
articles on political and philosophical
issues, all written by academics,
professors and students. So far two
issues have been published.

The magazine features a problem
of particular urgency at America’s
colleges and universities. According
to the magazine’s publishers, ‘‘The
goal of Campus is to focus public
awareness on the denial of the right
of free speech to those who do not
follow the academic party line on
curriculum reform, classroom politici-
zation and declining educational stan-
dards.”’

Lagarde is responsible for writing,
editing and assigning articles. La-
garde said he will be contacted by
the editor-in-chief or the student
senior editors with a story ‘assign-
ment. He is then responsible for
either writing it himself or supervis-

ing the assignment and defining the
angle of the issue in which the mag-
azine is interested.

Largarde said he is expected to
‘‘assign it, direct the person, edit and
turn it in.”’

Lagarde has already written an
article on fraternities and how they
are being attacked on campuses a-
round the country.

Not only was the Lagarde recog-
nized by the Intercollegiate Studies
Institute, but the independent maga-
zine of which he is editor-in-chief,
The Washington and Lee Spectator,
was also nationally recognized.

According to the editors of Na-
tional Review Magazine, ‘‘Campus
conservative newspapers are bloom-
ing like tulips in Holland, the latest
being The Washington and Lee Spec-
tator, and, at Holy Cross, The Fen-
wick Review. Both are witty and
vigorous.”

Generals’ defense tames Tigers 21-7

 

By Jay Piotkin
Sport: Editor

 

Scr the Washington and Lee foot-
ball team, it’s funny how well the
wrong play works against Hampden-
Sydney.

In 1979, Steve Corbeille broke a
cardinal rule of W&L football by
fielding a punt inside his own 10-
yard line. Corbeille escaped near
death only by returning the punt 94
yards for a touchdown, and the Gen-
erals shut out H-SC 20-0.

Last Saturday, it was another
wrong play that gave the Generals the
go-ahead touchdown in the 21-7
Homecoming win over the Tigers,
W&L’s first-ever Homecoming win
over H-SC.

On the second play of the fourth
quarter, junior quarterback Fred Ren-
neker, making his first start at quar-
terback, came into the huddle and
called ‘‘slot right, boot right.’’ The
only problem was that the play
wasn’t in the play-book.

But the Generals ran the play to
perfection. Junior slot back Jeff Kreis
lined up on the right, ran a pattern
and then stopped to block. He held
his block for a second and then
floated into the end zone.

Renneker rolled right, as he had
called, and waited for Kreis to break.
When he did, Renneker lofted a
perfect pass over two defenders into

the waiting hands of Kreis for a 13-
yard touchdown. Senior Carter
Quayle’s extra point made it 14-7,
and the Generals were on their way
to an upset win.

‘There was a little bit of confu-
sion,’ said Renneker. ‘‘I didn’t really
understand what [head] Coach [Gary
Fallon] had called, so Jeff and I kind
of improvised. He knew what he
was supposed to do, and I knew the
right action, and the play just devel-
oped,”’

W&L came back from a 7-0
halftime deficit, and may have won
the game on the opening kickoff of
the second half, even though it didn’t
count. Kreis returned the kick 86
yards for a touchdown, but the Gen-
erals were called offside on the play,
nullifying the score.

“But we didn’t Ict that get us
down,”’ said Fallon. ‘‘It was a tre-
mendous play and one that gave us a
great deal of momentum. We kept ii
and used the play to our advantage.”’

The Generals iced the game after
the defense collected the fifth of its
six tumovers on the day. After a
WA&L punt, the Tigers took over on
their own 47-yard line. Quarterback
Dwayne Bowyer rolled right to pass,
but threw the ball right to senior
safety Brad Miller, who came down
with the ball on the W&L 34.

Miller’s interception came with
8:10 left in the game. W&L held the
ball for the next 7:01, running 16

straight times, with the bulk of the |

running done by senior tailback Ma-
son Pope and sophomore fullback
Mark Goglia.

On the sixteenth play of the drive,
from the H-SC six-yard line, Fallon
varied from the usual, looking to use

‘Renneker’s athletic ability.

Out of the ‘‘power’’ set, three
tight ends and 6-6, 260 pound defen-
sive lineman Thomas May in the
backfield to block for Pope, Renneker
faked the handoff and walked into the
end zone around the left end for the
final score, his second of the day to
make the score 21-7.

Pope finished the day with 119
yards on 30 carries while Goglia
carried 12 times for 56 yards, both
career highs. Said Fallon, ‘‘In our
system, the fullback is more of a
glorified guard. But with the muddy
field, we thought we could get some
yardage with the fullback, and we
did.”’

The defense, led by senior free
safety Clark Wight, caused five turn-
overs in the second half, six on the
day, and forced Bowyer, the ODAC’s
leading passer coming into the game,
into five interceptions.

Said Fallon, ‘‘It was a case where
we got everyone playing well. The
offensive line was blocking. The
defense was getting the offense the
ball. The special teams played well.
This was as complete a win as we’ve
had in a while. The kids worked hard

W&L upsets Lynchburg 2-0

 

By MacGregor Tisdale
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee women’s
soccer team capped off a successful
week with their first ever win over
Lynchburg College Wednesday 2-0.

The Generals sailed through an
easy week as they outscored their two
opponents 9-0.

On Homecoming weekend, W&L
shut out Randolph-Macon Woman’s
College 7-0. The two wins moved
the Generals record to 9-3; 5-2 in the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference.

the Generals seven goals on Saturday.
Hankins has five goals this season.

Freshman goalie Kate Stimeling
recorded her sixth and seventh shut-
outs respectively. Over a course of
12 games, she has only given up ten
goals.

Stimeling’s most recent shutout
came in dramatic fashion against
Lynchburg. With six minutes left in
the game, Stimeling stopped a shot
from point-blank range, pinning the
ball against the crossbar before flip-
ping it over the bar, out of harm’s
way.

W&L led 1-0 at the half on soph-
omore Susan Moseley’s third goal of
the season. The Generals then turned
to their scoring machine to ice the

game after Stimeling’s save.

Freshman Karen Stutzmann iced
the game with her ninth goal of the
season at the 89:07 mark, giving the
Generals their first ever win over the
Hornets. Stimeling finished wiih 13
saves.

‘‘Stimeling is a positive asset to
this team,’’ said head coach Janine
Hathom. ‘‘She credits the defense in
front of her for the attention she gets.
She is a tough young lady who is
unselfish, team oriented, and a leader.
Kate also plays battered most of the
time which is testimony for her posi-
tive team spirit.’

W&L clinched third place in the
ODAC and earned the right to host a
first-round ODAC tournament game.

Generals drop two by 2-1

 

By John Laney
Associate Sports Editor

 

For 105 minutes on Homecoming
- Saturday, the Washington and Lee
. defense contained the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference’s top offensive
threat.
: In the next minute, however, Mike
McFarland slipped free and his un-
. assisted goal gave the Virginia Wes]-
eyan men’s soccer team a 2-1 over-
* time victory at Liberty Hall Field.
The Generals had a 1-0 lead
" before the division-leading Blue Mar-
« lins (11-0-2) evened the score with
1:20 to play in regulation.
“It was a real let down to come
~ 80 close,’’ said head coach Rolf
Piranian.
r In their final regular-season
ODAC game, the Generals lost to
‘ Randolph-Macon, 2-1 in overtime, on
Tuesday.
Against Virginia Wesleyan, W&L
r Scored its goal with just under three
minutes remaining in the second half.

sure with ten men. Their offensive
surge resulted in two comer kicks,
the second of which Jon Haskins
headed past junior goaltender Lee
Corbin to knot the score at 1-1.

Before Saturday’s game, the of-
fensive abilities of McFarland, the
1989 ODAC Player-of-the-Year, had
produced 11 goals and four assists.
Yet, shadowed by freshman defender
Jud Allen and the Generals’ back-
field, McFarland never posed a ser-
ious threat in regulation, even though
he had six shots.

But with 14:43 gone in overtime,
McFarland separated himself from the
W&L defense and sent a shot from
the left side that nicked the inside of
the left post before entering the goal.

With the win, VWC clinched first
place in the ODAC’s regular-season
standings.

“We played an excellent game
against Virginia Wesleyan,’’ said
Piranian. ‘‘We showed we could play
with anyone.’’

On Tuesday at Liberty Hall Field,
Randolph-Macon (6-9-2, 4-2 in the
ODAC) broke an 18-year winless
streak against W&L.

A goal in the first 45 seconds and
another 15 minutes into the overtime
period put the Yellow Jackets in
second place in the ODAC.

“‘We lost the fifth game because

head coach Susan Dittman. ‘‘They

"had a deep bench. We were just

The Generals came out in the first

by senior co-captain Lisa Jay, the
Generals steamrolled their way to a

Jay didn’t limit herself to serving,
though. She also handed out 46 as-
sists in the five games. Sophomore
Leslie Hess drove home Jay’s passes
with a .346 attack percentage. Junior
Mena McGowin recorded 20 kills and
29 digs while Junior Marci Brown
added 15 and 20 respectively.

W&L made a change in_ their
normal rotational pattern because of
something they saw in the films. The
film showed that EMC likes to dink
the ball over to throw off blockers.

After watching the film, the Gen-
erals changed from a rotational de-
fense to an elementary, middle-back
up, closing the holes that Eastern
Mennonite was used to hitting. The
Generals’ ability to adjust their game
plan to counter EMC’s showed matu-
rity and growing confidence according
to Dittman.

“This team is beginning to be-
come able to adjust,’’ said Dittman.
“We're able to pick on our oppo-
nent’s weak points.”’

After the victory in Game 1, the
Generals split two games with East-
ern Mennonite. Up 2-1, and leading
in the fourth, W&L coughed, sput-
tered, and died. But despite the
disappointing loss, Dittman was im-
pressed with the play of her team.

‘‘We’re an improving tcam,’’ said
Dittman. ‘‘To lose in five [games]

step.”’

drive.

On the third possession, H-SC
drove to the W&L 13 before stalling
and attempting a field goal. David
Brickhill’s kick never had a chance
as May blocked it and sophomore
linebacker Lyle Smith, making his
first start, fell on the ball.

In the second half, after :‘en-
neker’s scoring pass to Kreis, the
Tigers threatened to draw even, but
the heroics of Wight kept the Gener-
als out of danger. Bowyer hit Jay
Hicks with an out nattern, and as
Hicks streaked dowr the sideline,
Wight caught him from behind and
tripped him at the 10-yard line, sav-
ing a touchdown.

Two plays later, Wight stevped in
front of H-SC tight end John Jewell
and intercepted his second pass 1 ‘ue
day, at the five-yard line to end the
Tigers threat.

Wight said the interceptions were
the reward of hard work during the
week. ‘‘I looked at a lot of film
during the week with Coach [defen-
sive coordinator Chuck] O’Connell
and took more repetitions than usual
in practice. We saw some things on
film and I was able to apply them
during the game. It was just the
result of hard work.”’

Polo falls twice in fourth quarter

The Washington and Lee water
polo team travelled to Providence,
R.I. last weekend and endured three
tough losses at the North Varsity
Invitational.

The Generals, 8-5 on the season,
opened up with national power Navy
and lost 16-5 before facing Iona in
their second match.

Said head coach Page Remillard,
‘We put together our first game of
four real good quarters.’’ But they
were not enough, as a shot at the end
of regulation hit the cross bar and
bounced away. The Gencrals could
not score in overtime and fell 11-10.

Remillard said the Generals played
great defense the first two quarters
and after halftime came up with a
great third quarter. But the fourth
quarter was the pivotal quarter and
Richmond capitalized on the Gener-
al’s lapse and won 12-9.

Remillard said his team played

team cannot be satisfied with playing
well and losing and must continue to
progress and improve and win those
games.

Sophomore Scott Strader and

This weekend, the Generals travel

implications pending the outcome.

Lloyd’s fights gang image

Owner hopes to draw student crowd again

 

By Chris Swann
Staff Reporter

 

Lloyd’s of Lexington, a former
student hangout, has been empty of
W&L patrons this year. Lloyd’s
blames fraternity renaissance, but
some students say they are frightened
to go there because of local gangs.

The fast-food restaurant, located
one block away from campus on
Washington Street, traditionally drew
a large crowd of W&L students on
the weekends. "Going to Lloyd’s"
was often heard in years past at
fraternity parties after bands shut
down and kegs ran dry.

This fall, according to Lloyd’s,
fewer students go to eat or play
video games than in past years. Stu-
dents say they are afraid of being
harassed, or attacked by local delin-
quents.

We’re afraid to go to
Lloyd’s because of
the gangs.

-- Katy Bailey
and Karen Halsell

“We're atraid to go to Lloyd's
because of the gangs," W&L juniors
Katy Bailey and Karen Halsell said.

"Freshman year we used to go all
the time," Bailey said. "We went a
couple of times all last year. This
year we haven’t gone at all.”

Workers at Lloyd’s, however, say
that gangs should not be an issue.

"I don’t see that being a prob-
lem,” Robert Rorrer, a Lloyd’s em-
ployee, said. Rorrer, a Lexington
resident who worked for Lloyd's
from 1984-86 and has been working
there this year since August, was
surprised to hear that students were
scared to come to Lloyd's. He largely
blamed the loss of Red Square resi-
dents for the lack of student business.

Rorrer said he did not believe that
any local gangs existed anymore. He
referred specifically to L-Posse, a
group of locals that Lexington police
and students blame for most acts of
violence in the area.

"I was talking with one local

 

 

 

senior in high school," Rorrer said,
"and he was saying there’s no gang
around here anymore.”

Rorrer said L-Posse consisted of
a few local black teenagers with
flattop haircuts who wore LA Raiders
caps.

They’re just a bunch
of fourteen-year-olds.
What are they going
to do to you?

— Lloyd Smith

“They’re just a bunch of fourteen-
year-olds,” owner Lloyd Smith said.
“What are they gonna do to you?"

Officer G.B. Coleman of the
Lexington Police Department said that
L-Posse is not an organized gang. It
is small, Coleman said, and the really
bad ones are the four or five leaders.

Rorrer, who attended Washington
and Lee during the 1983-84 academic
year, acknowledged that there had
always been and always would be
friction between students and Lexing-
ton residents. A local black youth had
harassed a W&L student and his
Homecoming date this past Saturday,
Rorrer said, because the W&L stu-
dent had accidentally elbowed the
youth’s girlfriend.

Rorrer said the youth taunted the
student, then hit him. Rorrer called
the police, who drove by soon after,
and the youth left. The W&L student
stayed in his booth the whole time
and stayed afterwards to finish his
meal, Rorrer said.

When he wanted to leave with his
date, however, the youth and several
others were sitting across the street
from Lloyd's. Rorrer said Lloyd’s
again called the police, and later
Rorrer observed the student and his
date walking unmolested down Wash-
ington Street.

"If I see anything like trouble, I’m
going to call the cops immediately,"
Rorrer said.

Last year, two specific incidents
of violence involving students and
locals became stories frequently heard
on The Hill. Colin Fleming and Rob-
ert Josey, both sophomores, said they
were attacked inside of Lloyd’s by a

FAST

 

Lge g

Rene

black male in September of last year.

According to Josey, the man ac-
cused the two of hitting his girlfriend,
and began hitting them. Josey said he
and Fleming did not hit the man’s
girlfriend. The police were called, but
no arrests were made and no charges
were filed.

John R. “Rand” Holstead, brother
of W&L student Scott Holstead, class
of '92, and Richard B. "Bland" War-
ren, class of °90, said they were
attacked and beaten by Thomas M.
Sloan III, 18, of Lexington.

The incident occurred on Decem-
ber 2, 1989, outside of Lloyd’s. Ac-
cording to Officer Coleman, the re-
porting officer, the fight started after
Sloan threw a rolled-up magazine at
Holstead’s passing car. Holstead and
Warren stopped and got out of the
car, Coleman said, and the fight
Started.

Sloan was arrested that night for
assault and malicious wounding, on
Holstead, a felony, and assault and
battery on Warren, a misdemeanor.
Holstead was treated for cuts on his
lip and forehead at Stonewall Jackson
Hospital, according to a police report,
and then released.

Holstead, a native of Houston,
Texas, did not follow up on prosecu-
tion of Sloan because of the distance
between his home and Lexington, as
well as for the safety of his brother
Scott, Coleman and Scott Holstead
said.

Lexington Police Chief Bruce
Beard said he was disappointed to
hear of the failure to prosecute. The
only way to punish people who com-
mit such acts, he said, is to get those
people in court.

"If you can identify, prosecute,”
Beard said.

If | see anything like
trouble, I’m going to
call the cops immed-
jately.

— Robert Rorrer

Officer Coleman said that the
police could not act without the coop-
eration of the victims.

"The first guy may just get a
black eye, but the next time the next

The
Fast
Lane

 

 

 

guy might not get as lucky," he said.
"As long as they keep getting away
with it, they’ll keep doing it."

Carol Damewood, a junior dorm
counselor, said a group of freshmen
girls on her hall went to Lloyd's this
fall. Damewood said the girls told her
they felt very uncomfortable as a
group of black youths were loitering
outside the restaurant. Damewood did
not blame the restaurant, however.

"It’s not a reflection of the busi-
ness itself," Damewood said, referring
to the loitering youths.

Rorrer was indignant when he
heard of this story.

"That kind of stuff is gonna stop,"
he said. He said, when he can, he
tells loiterers outside the restaurant to
leave. A "No Loitering" sign has
been put up inside of Lloyd’s as
well.

Rorrer also said that he had heard
that only two workers had handled
the weekend shifts last spring. Two
workers can not operate the restaurant
and the crowds it used to serve.
Customers may have gone to other
fast-food restaurants for service.

Rorrer said that when he worked
in 1984-86, there were three-hour-
long periods on Friday and Saturday
nights when he couldn’t see the
booths across from the counter be-
cause of the crowds of student cus-
tomers. Two people could not handle
that kind of crowd, he said.

Lloyd’s has plenty of workers
now, he added, but no one to serve.
He admitted that the loss of Red
Square fraternities was a big blow to
business.

“We can’t last ‘til February,"
Lloyd Smith said, referring to the
projected date of fraternity renais-
sance completion.

When I was leaving Lloyd’s after
speaking with workers, a_ skinny
black youth who couldn’t have been
older than sixteen walked in and went
Straight to the gameroom. He wore
no cap, but had a flattop haircut. He
looked harmless and carried no ma-
chine guns or other weapons, as far
as I could tell. A local former em-
ployee of Lloyd’s, whom I'd talked
to.

"That’s one of the El Posse," he
said.
