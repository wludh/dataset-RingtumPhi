Unfinished construction on four fraternity
houses in Phase I of the Fraternity Renaissance
Program has pushed back the start of Phase II.

“Because of delays in the construction
process, we have delayed moving into Phi Delta
Theta, Pi Kappa Alpha, [Phi Kappa Sigma and
Beta Theta Pi],’’ said Coordinator of Capital
Planning Frank Parsons Wednesday.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Nu are the

only Phase I projects on schedule, he said.
Members have moved in although construction on
the basements has not been finished.
i The university’s goal is to have Phi Delt and
PiKA finished-by. February. break, Parsons said.
Phi Kapp and Beta will be completed later in the
| Spring, he said.

Because Bass Construction Company, the
contractors for Phase I, could not stay on

«<

 

 

schedule, the university fired the company.

*‘Generally speaking, there is a downturn in
the construction business,’’ Parsons said. ‘‘Many
quality constructors are looking for work.’’

The university hopes to take advantage of
market conditions to hire new contractors at
lower prices for Phase II. It will receive bids
from companies on Jan. 15 for construction on
the new Kappa Sigma house (the old Zeta Beta
Tau) and on Jan. 16 for Lambda Chi Alpha.

If the prices are right work on the houses
will begin in mid-February, Parsons said.

If the bidding process goes well, the
university will negotiate with contractors in
February to begin construction on Phi Kappa Psi
and Pi Kappa Phi, Parsons said.

Sigma Chi and Delta Tau Delta, two other
houses scheduled. for Phase If; are. currently
under study. The university is working with each
fraternity’s building committee.

Because Sigma Chi is on a small plot, it
would be difficult to bring the house up to

begin Phase Two as soon as possible.

|Phase One plan renovated

SAE, Sigma Nu move in; delays force others to wait

standards without spending too much money.

The university will consider building Sigma
Chi a new house in the Davidson Park area,
Parsons said.

Delta Tau Delta is a relatively zzew and well-
built house, Parsons said. ‘‘Delt is the smallest
renovation expenditure we will be encountering,’
he said.

Sigma Phi Epsilon, which has applied to take
part in the renovation, has hired an independent
architectural firm to redesign their house.

Because of Sig Ep’s location and the
necessary renovations the university will have to
get a conditional use permit from the city.

The university will study building Sig Ep a
house in Davidson Park with Sigma Chi.

If Sigma Chi and Sigma Phi Epsilon move,
both. the two fraternities and the sororities. might
share Davidson Park.

If sororities are not located in Davidson Park,
they may be placed somewhere else, Parsons
said.

 

 

Washington and Lee senior Patri-
cia Lopes is a long way from home,
but this autumn, the Kailua, Hawaii,
native will take a larger geographical
step to do graduate work.

Lopes is
headed _ = for
Oxford, En-
gland as a
Rhodes Scholar,
an honor that
was announced
on December 8,
the first day of
fall -term
exams.

Lopes __is
W&L’s 14th
Rhodes Scholar
nad the
school’s _ first
since 1983. She is also the first
W&L woman to receive the honor.
W&L President John D. Wilson, a
Michigan State University alumnus,
was awarded the scholarship in 1953.

The Rhodes Scholarship was initi-
ated in 1903 by the estate of British
philanthropist Cecil Rhodes, an Ox-
ford graduate.

Lopes is among 32 students in the
nation awarded the. prestigious schol-
arships for two years’ study at the
University of Oxford, the oldest uni-
versity in the English-speaking world.
She plans to study for a second un-
dergraduate degree combining poli-

Pat

tics, philosophy and economics.

“This is an extraordinary event
and a great achievement for Pat,”’
said William Connelly, an associate
professor of politics and one of
Lopes’ academic advisors.

“‘She is remarkably talented and
extremely balanced,’’ he said. ‘‘A lot
of people are good students or good
athletes or leaders in extracurricular
activities, but few are good in all. Pat
has unlimited energy, despite her
low-key manner and she is ambitious;
but her ambition is to do good and
help others.”’

In late September, Assistant Dean
of Students Kenneth Ruscio
suggested to Lopes that she apply for
the scholarship. Lopes said no, but
Ruscio kept encouraging her until she
decided to do it.

“‘T just wanted her to realize how
strong her candidacy would be,”’
Ruscio said. ‘‘She’s competent in so
many different areas with many ac-
complishments in each one. I thought
she’d have a great shot at the schol-
arship.”’

Lopes sent her application to the
scholarship committee in Hawaii in
October. After learning that she had
been chosen for an interview, she
flew to Hawaii on November 30.

Two days after her Hawaii inter-
view, Lopes moved on to the regional
interview in Los Angeles, where 15
students from seven western states
competed for four scholarships.

‘City moves Sororities rush to prepare for Friday

 

-ahead with
car tax

;

, By Greg Patterson
Staff Reporter

 

 

'

; The city of Lexington has begun

compiling a list of student vehicles so
‘ it can begin billing students for per-
, sonal property tax.

City Commissioner of Revenue
‘Courtney Baker said her office is
, making a list of cars owned by W&L

students who live within the city
‘ limits. Baker said she hopes to begin
, sending out bills to owners within a
month.
‘Baker has received from VMI a
list of cars registered by cadets with
"the school. W&L officials have thus
‘far refused to give a similar list to
the city saying such a move would
' violate federal laws protecting private
, Student records.

In order to track down cars owned
‘ by university students, Baker said she
, has a number of sources. One will be

city police officer Roger Clark, who
‘ will record license plate numbers of
*, cars that seem to belong to students
who live in the city.
‘Other methods include using re-
, cords from the state Department of
Motor Vehicles for students who have
‘registered their cars in Virginia and
,_ checking newly-required permits for
large capacity houses which must
‘ contain information about cars owned
by occupants.

Baker's office has hired a part-

+time employee to “help with the
paperwork" involved with collecting
‘the tax.
, The tax is being assessed on
student vehicles because Virginia state
‘law says personal property tax is to
, be paid wherever a car is kept for the
majority of the year.
‘It's something new for every-
body,’’ she said. ‘*We're going to
“have to look at it on a case-by-case
, basis.’’

The tax does not apply to students

‘who pay property tax on their cars in

their home state. Also, the city can-
"not enforce the tax for students who
,live outside of city limits, though
Baker says those students should be
‘paying tax to Rockbridge County.

More than 140 Washington and Lee women
will participate in Winter Rush for sororities,
which begins Friday with Open Houses.

Rush marks the third year of sororities at
W&L for its three established chapters, Kappa
Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma and Chi
Omega, and will be the first formal Rush for
the newly colonized Delta Gamma sorority.

Rush involves four sets of Rush parties; an

Preference parties. It will conclude Jan. 17 with
the extension of bids. Rushees are primarily
from the freshman class, with 10 upperclassmen
participating. According to Panhellenic Council
President Nancy Mitchell, this Rush will be
similar to last year’s with few exceptions.
According to Mitchell, the number of bids
each sorority may extend, or their quota, will
be determined earlier this year than last year.
Last year, quotas were set after the last Rush
date. This year, the quota for each sorority will
be set by the number of women still rushing
after the third Rush parties divided by four.
Also, rushees will only be allowed to attend

three Preference parties, so they must eliminate
one sorority if invited to a Preference party by
all four.

‘Basically, the attention will be focused
earlier in both cases,’’ Mitchell said.

Mitchell also said the number of participants
in Rush may indicate a need for more sororities
in the future because the expected 30 pledges
per sorority is ‘‘still too much’’ for the three
established houses.

Currently, each
members apiece.

Associate Dean of Students for Greek
Affairs Leroy ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins has said new

sorority has over 70

sororities will not be considered until DG
becomes proportional to the other three.

The DG colony currently has 11 pledges
who will be assisted in their Rush by DG
members from University of Virginia and
Duke University.

Mitchell reminded that there is a Rush week
‘“‘no-contact rule’’ beginning Friday which
prohibits communication between rushees and
sorority members until Bid Day.

Freshmen are also discouraged from going
out to parties this weekend, she said.

“Tt has to be that way to insure a fair
Rush,’’ she said.

Law would force
VMI coeducation

Proposal would preempt court case

 

By Courtney Hall
Staff Reporter

 

Virginia State Senator Emilie
Miller has drafted a bill which, if
passed by the General Assembly next
month, will force VMI to admit wo-
men; and Commonwealth Attorney
Mary Sue Terry has left the case.

The bill Miller plans to submit
does not mention VMI explicitly, but
says that ‘‘every public institution of
higher education must accept qualified
students regardless of race, sex, reli-
gion, political association, or national
origin.”’

Miller said that she will submit
the bill before the January 22 dead-
line. The bill will then be reviewed
by the education health committee
and will be presented to the General
Assembly for vote on February 4,

According to Miller, if the Gener-
al Assembly passes the bill, VMI can
still fight the decision in court, but
will be forced to change their admis-
sions policy to admit girls until the
decision is reversed.

If the law is indeed passed, she
said, the school will be forced to
renovate its facilities to accomodate
women cadets, even though the law-
suit may not have been decided.

Miller said that it is impossible to
predict how much support the bill
will receive.

‘“‘Nobody’s talking,’’ said Miller.
‘‘Legislators want to avoid the is-

sue,

This is the second such bill intro-
duced by Miller. The first was intro-
duced in January of last year. Soon
thereafter, the U.S. Justice Depart-
ment announced that it considered
VMI’s admissions policy to be un-
constitutional.

Despite considerable publicity, the
bill was killed in committee on Feb.
14,

Virginia Attorney General Mayy
Sue Terry wants to avoid the issue as
well.

Last month, Terry was relieved of
all duties in the defense of Virginia
Military Institute’s all-male admis-
sions policy by U.S. District Court
Judge Jackson Kiser. Terry said that,
because Virginia Governor L. Doug-
las Wilder had endorsed coeduca-
tion at VMI, her office could not
continue to represent the school.

Robert H. Patterson Jr., a VMI

alumnus and senior partner in the
Richmond-based law firm of Mc-
Guire, Woods, Battle and Boothe will
now head the team of lawyers repre-
senting VMI, the Alumni Associ-
ation, and the VMI Foundation.

Terry has also convinced some
high-powered lawyers to work for
free to defend VMI’s position.

Governor Doug Wilder will be
represented seperately by Benjamin
Civiletti of Baltimore, who refused
Terry’s offer to also represent the
Commonwealth.

Some believe that the Virginia

 

Trials and tribulations

* March 7: U.S Justice Depart-
ment files suit in federal court in
Roanoke against VMI admissions
policy.

* May 23: Gov. Wilder announ-
ces to VMI’s class of 1990 that
he will let the courts decide the
coeducation issue.

* October 24: Judge Jackson
Kiser sets April 4-8 as trial dates,

* November 7: Kiser permits VMI
Foundation and Alumni Associa-
tion as additional defendants in
trial.

* November 20: Wilder announces
that he is in favor of coeducation.

* November 28: Atty. Gen. Mary
Sue Terry decides to withdraw as
VMI’s chief defender.

* December 12: Kiser releases
Terry from VMI's defense.

 

 

 

Attorney General's departure from the
case will be detrimental.

Without the high-ranking official
on their side, VMI’s case may very
well be weakened.

According to VMI Public Infor-
mation Officer Tom Joynes, Terry’s
resignation will not affect the case.

Joynes said if Terry had been un-
able to name a replacement, the suit
would have been thrown out.

“But we’re happy with the re-
placement,’’ said Joins, ‘‘so it doesn’t
bother us.’’

Examining what's
really important

With the failure of the last-minute negotiations in
Geneva yesterday, our country now, more than ever, faces
war in the Persian Gulf.

It’s not necessary for us to remind you all of what that
entails, not only for those who are serving in Saudi
Arabia but also for those who remain at home. Unlike
previous American military excursions in recent years, a
war to force Iraq from Kuwait would last months (if not
longer) and cost possibly thousands of American lives.

No longer are those serving in the Gulf merely a
nameless, faceless horde. During Christmas Break, I found
out that one of my best friends from high school had
been deployed to Saudi Arabia.

He’s a member of the 82nd Army Airbome Division,
and he’s currently training other soldiers how to use the
M-16 rifle. It is with much regret that I note that I fear
he will soon put that expertise to a different use.

Nevertheless, there’s a silver lining to every cloud. In
this case, the Persian Gulf crisis allows us to consider
what’s really important. Previously, we have been allowed
to consider our own futures at the expense of almost
everything else. Maybe the impending war will force us to
consider the general direction our country has taken,
instead of focusing on our own concerns.

The crisis of misaligned priorities is by no means
confined to Lexington. As George Will wrote, “‘we often
seem more concerned with the future of a species of trout
than we are with that of a poor, black woman who’s
pregnant.”’

Perhaps we need this kind of crisis to force us to
consider what’s really important. Perhaps we as a country
need periodic reminders that there is a real world, with
real problems, outside our hometown.

Meanwhile, while we are concerned with these more
mundane matters, there are nearly half a million men and
women waiting to fight a war for us. The staff of The
Ring-tum Phi wishes them all a speedy and safe return.

Care enough to
send the best

The W&L Alumni Office is encouraging students to
send care packages to the American forces in the Gulf.
We would like to add our voice to that cause.

Please take the time to use the addresses included
elsewhere in this edition and send a letter or package
“‘over there.”’

By the latest count, there are at least 15 W&L alumni
stationed in or around Saudi Arabia, and they’d love to
hear from you.

Quote of the week

I’ve seen people in New York step over other human
beings lying in their own piss to spit on someone else for
wearing a chinchilla fur coat. Noboby likes to see those

Back our troops in Saudi Arabia

 

MY VIEW
By C. Edward Klank III

“What you call hell, Rambo calls home.”

Let me briefly introduce myself. My name is C.
Edward Klank, a 1989 graduate of this university.
Many of the seniors and perhaps some of the
juniors will remember some of the insightful
contributions I made to this publication. I'm a
Marine Corps lieutenant currently deployed to
Saudi Arabia. I’m supposed to have been stationed
in Hawaii for an extended 3-year vacation, but the
current hoopla threw a wrench in my plans. I spent
a grand total of nine days on Oahu before flying
over to this desert paradise. My car is probably
rusting in Pearl Harbor, and I honestly have no
idea where my clothes, television, and other per-
sonal items are in Hawaii, if indeed they made it
there. It will be a hectic search once I get back.

Today marks the end of our third month in
Southwest Asia. By the time this letter gets print-
ed, we will have spent four months in country and
the January 15 United Nations deadline for Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait will be right around the
comer. My stay here hasn’t been particularly
exciting, although I do have some interesting
stories to tell. However, my purpose is not to
relate any ‘‘sea stories,’’ but instead to discuss
some disturbing news from the homefront.

I quote some clown from Harvard: ‘‘Well,
maybe the goverment didn’t learn anything from
Vietnam, but we (the students) heve. We don’t
need to reinvent the wheel.’’ The reply of a
Berkeley student when asked if they are protesting
to relive the nostalgic, liberal-infested days of the
late 1960’s: ‘‘We don’t want to be hippies or
anything, we’re just concerned with what’s going
on. We want to see all of the soldiers (and Mar-

Appreciate W&L
while you’re here

I recently had occasion to be on the campus
at W&L to speak to a group of English majors.
The following day I remained in town to do
some research in the University Library. Al-
though I had often been on campus since my
graduation, this was the first time I had been
there during classes since beginning graduate
school at William and Mary.

It was fashionable when I was a student, as
I am sure it is now, to say that the speaking
tradition at W&L is dead. Yet I was struck when
on campus by how many people spoke to me.
Most of the people whom I passed spoke or at
least smiled and nodded. One forgets until one
goes elsewhere, where friendliness is not cus-
tomary, how pleasant our speaking tradition is.
The speaking tradition certainly doesn’t seem
dead, though students must work always to keep
it alive. Thanks to all who are friendly and keep
encouraging others to do the same!

In a similar vein, I suppose it is still the
custom to think that the Honor System is in
failing health. Once again experience at William
and Mary tells me otherwise. At least at W&L
people talk about the Honor System. so that Hon-
or is frequently on people's minds. My fellow
students laugh at me and another W&L graduate
in my program because we pledge our papers,
and distrust of students is the order of the day at
this school which had the first honor system.
Keep on talking and arguing about the Honor

 

I could give a dissertation on the pros and cons
of American involvement in the region, but I'll
simply say the pros outweigh the cons. I admire
the Berkeley student’s aspiration not to be a hippie
and simply remain a generic invalid. I also respect
his concern for the many thousands of young
Marines here. However, if he’s genuinely con-
cerned he would not be trying to undermine morale
by protesting.

 

Personally, if | happen to
come across any of these
dissidents when | get home,
! will destroy them.

The young Marines listen to the news every
day and they don’t need to hear about discontent
at home. If elementary and middle school students

System — that’s what makes it work.

Finally, let me say how much one appreci-
ates all of the things taken for granted at W&L
when one goes elsewhere. I didn’t realize how
spoiled W&L students are by the library until |
started using William and Mary’s on a regular
basis. Nor did I realize how much the Co-op, the
book store, and the GHQ added to the sense of
community of W&L when I was there. In short,
the longer I am away from Lexington, the fonder
and prouder I grow of our University.

 

 

Sincerely,
Christopher R. Carter '87

Dean Howison’s
“Top Ten list”

The following are the ten most notable impres-
sions of my first term at Washington and Lee.

1) W&L vs. Emory and Henry.

My first W&L athletic event nearly broke my
heart. Even though the football team lost on the
last play of the game, the intensity of the com-
petition, the quality of the play and the spirit of
the athletes was so extraordinary that the final
score was almost irrelevant. Division III sport at
its best.

2) Lee; the Last Years.

I read Charles Flood’s book last summer
while sitting on a porch in a hollow looking out
over the Colonnade. I was so impressed that
when I spoke to the freshmen during Orientation
in Lee Chapel, I recommended that they get the
book and read it before they completed their first
year at W&L. A few weeks later, as I was
walking home after work, I noticed two students
sitting on the grass in front of Lee Chapel. I
went over to say hello, and to my delight, I
discovered that they were reading the Lee book.
Once in a while, students actually listen to a
dean.

3) The Turkey Trot.

On a cool, cloudy afternoon in October, |
joined about 180 runners at the annual W&L
Turkey trot. The hilly 5K course through the
woods was muddy and water-logged. I finished

19th and our 40-and-over team, led by race
winner John Tucker, won the unofficial team
title. It’s hard to explain how running to near

I believe the good senator is trying to unseat
Jane Fonda as the military’s least favorite person.
Lucky for Mr. Kennedy that Hanoi Jane will
probably never lose that distinction.

Protests without adequate justification are public
displays of idiocy. I remember a rebuttal to my
first letter published in the Phi: ‘‘If ignorance is
bliss, C.E.K. III is a happy guy.’’ Well, I'll go.
ahead and use the remark since it wasn't apropos
the first time. If ignorance is bliss, college stu-,
dents protesting the American involvement in the
Middle East are some merry folks. These students |
aren’t helping alleviate the problem, they are the,
problem. Personally, if I happen to come across
any of these dissidents when I get home, I will '
destroy them. Perhaps these radicals ought to listen
to some of the younger Americans who flood the

mail with care packages and letters expressing their '
appreciation and admiration of the American troops ,

in the Gulf. I’ll quote the mother of a third grader
in Royal Oak, Michigan who wrote to me after I
returned a letter to her patriotic son, who sacrificed
his time to write to ‘‘ANY SERVICE MEMBER”:
“‘Thanks to you and all the Marines who are
sacrificing your time to do your duty. That is
rare. I want you to know you're app-eciated.”’
In conclusion...

{

‘

\

“Abstinence from alcohol is a virtue I admire, |

in others.”’

exhaustion up a steep, muddy hill can be fun,
but it is.
4) Lexington weather.

Before coming to W&L, I lived for 21 years
in northem New York, a few miles from the
Canadian border. The weather there was bad. The
weather in Lexington is good. Trust me.

5) Critical Probation.

For better or for worse, I may be forever
identified with Critical Probation.
6) W&L’s faculty.

Over 80 percent of last year’s seniors indi-
cated that out-of-class availability and support of
the W&L faculty was a hallmark of their college
experience. I’ve been fortunate to be affiliated
with some fine colleges, but I’ve never seen such
positive regard for faculty. It is well-deserved.
7) Auxiliary Office

Several times during the Fall Term I left my
comfortable office in Payne Hall, took a sign that
read Dean Howison’s Auxiliary Office, and set
up a table outside the Co-op. The reactions were
mixed. One student was very direct — ‘‘Who are
you and what are you doing here?’’ Others
offered constructive criticism. A few said nice
things to me. I'll be back.

8) Fancy Dress.

I have never experienced Fancy Dress. Many
people have told me what to expect. Some have
offered condolences in advance. I have bought a
tuxedo, so I am prepared. For what, I’m not
sure.

9) Student leaders.

A 1990 national survey of college seniors
indicated that three times more W&L students
were satisfied with their student government and
their voice in influencing college policies than
students at comparable liberal arts colleges. The
student leaders I have worked with this term
have been outstanding. They have demonstrated
a strong committment to the principles of self-
government and individual responsibility, Based
on my contact with them, I understand why a
significant number of W&L students believe, with
good reason, that they have more control over
their lives than students at other colleges.

10) Washington Hall Steps.

One of the steps on the Colonnade in front
of Washington Hall is made up of three weath-
ered, well-worn stones. Each day when I walk
to work, I make a conscientious effort to step on

the stone with the deepest indentation. In this
way, | join countless others who have made their
marks at Washington and Lee.

to drugs’’ movement, I think that is
time that I informed the Youth of
America about the inherent hazards of
drugs in a Pulitzer Prize-caliber ex-
position. The major problem with my
plans that the Youth of America
don’t read my column. In fact, the
only people who read my column are
already heavily into drugs. Another
problem with my plan for an anti-
drug exposition is that I’m currently
so stoned out of my mind from
smoking marijuana that I doubt I'll
be able to make it past the first
paragraph. Of course, I’m only
joking.

The truth is that I just took a hit
of LSD and I’m waiting for my
computer to decide if it is a fire-
breathing dragon or a talking bowl of
rice. That’s another joke. The real
reason I can’t write an anti-drug
column is that I’ve eaten so much
opium today that I’m content just
hanging out in the living room pre-

tending that I’m a coffee table.

The real truth is that I don’t use
illegal drugs. I have enough problems
functioning in modern society without
them (today, for example, I spent
over two hours looking for my car
keys). I realize that there are many
people out there in magic mushroom
reader land like my parents who think
that I’m a crazed drug addict, so
maybe I should reiterate that I don’t
use illegal drugs.

Okay, I admit that 1 sometimes
inhale deeply in the vicinity of gaso-
line fumes, modeling glue or paint
thinner, and that I’ve been known to
take an extra table spoon of codeine
cough syrup now and then, but
what’s wrong with that? And sure,
sometimes I drill holes in my teeth
so my dentist will give me laughing
gas when he fills them up. But be-
lieve me, it’s nothing I can’t handle.
I’m no drug addict. I can stop if I
need to. I just wish I could convince
my doctor to get me some more
valium.

Honestly, readers, if we want to
get our school children off drugs,
what we first need to do is figure out
if they’re on drugs. Next, we need to
think up some catchy slogans to

The Ring-tum Phi, January 10, 1991

discourage them from using drugs.
When I attended public high school
in drug-riddled Tampa, Florida, there
was a big crack cocaine scare. To
prevent a crack epidemic, the alert
principal put up clever posters every-
where, featuring witty phrases like
Crack can make your heart attack and
Crack can make your lungs black.

Unfortunately, the principal’s anti-
drug campaign was undermined when
my friends and I hung up a huge
banner during a pep rally skit that
said Crack can make your lips smack.
Later, we threw rotten fruit into the
crowd, but that’s getting a little bit
off the subject. In retrospect, I
decided it was wrong for us to make
fun of the principal’s serious anti-
drug campaign, because we were
punished with three days of work
detail. I always dreaded work detail
because it entailed rising at dawn to
spend an entire Saturday picking up
trash on the school campus, but that’s
also getting off the subject (it’s tough
to stay on the subject when I’m not
exactly sure what it is).

Getting back to the subject of
drugs in high school, my advice to
students is that they go with someth-
ing relaxing like quaaludes and stay

away from anything psychedelic
because its tough to concentrate when
your trigonometry teacher grows
another head every time she does a
problem on the chalkboard. Of
course, that was another joke. If we
really want our young people to stop
Japan from thrashing us so badly in
math, science, and even English, we
must keep drugs out of our high
schools. We also must recruit teach-
ers who make good role models,
teachers unlike the history teacher at
my high school who tried to mail a
package of cocaine from South Amer-
ica to his house in Tampa (on my
honor, I didn’t make that up).

How can we expect our students
to compete with the Japanese when
their teachers aren’t even clever
enough to figure out a way to smug-
gle drugs into the country? What this
country really needs is teachers who
grow their own drugs.

Unfortunately, I’m too tired to
continue writing (Damn it! Where did
I put those amphetamines?). But be-
fore I go, I want to tell anyone who
is still reading this article that they
obviously have a serious drug prob-
lem and I recommend that they seek
professional help immediately.

Don’t blame rape on the victim

 

MY VIEW
By Pam Patton

 

I had mixed feelings as I listened to Lisa Sliwa, an
expert in self-defense from New York City’s
Guardian Angels, speak at Lee Chapel. On one
hand, I think it’s always helpful to try to educate
a community about crime, and about rape and
violence against women in particular. But I had
some serious misgivings about the message she
sent.

Her dramatization of a fraternity-party gang
rape featured Bambi, a tipsy Southern belle whose
IQ was no higher than her bra size. Batting her
eyelashes at the big strong men offering her one
beer after another, Sliwa’s Bambi does not know
that she is the whitetail surrounded by hunters; that
they are proceeding according to a game plan
they’ve plotted out in advance. She doesn’t know
the rules of this game. She’s in enemy territory.
She gets dizzy, and is taken upstairs. There, she

to no avail. Finally, trapped alone with the guy,
she needs to get herself out of a potentially dan-
gerous situation.

Sliwa then acted the part of a woman who is
attacked by a stranger, and began the self-defense
demonstration. It wasn’t much we haven’t heard
before. Fingers or thumbs to the eyes, nose, throat,
groin. Stomp on his foot. Rake his face with your
keys, a pen, a comb.

It’s good stuff to know, just in case you may
want to use it some day. It also leaves you with a
good feeling — it’s empowering to believe that
with a little know-how and a few well-placed
chops, a 110 pound woman can neutralize a 200
pound rapist.

 

Before a woman can fight
off a rape, she has to know
that she has the right to.

 

‘‘gets it.’’ This happens, says Sliwa, all the time.
Everywhere.

That may be true. But this demeaning, stereo-
typical portrait serves only to falsely reassure us
women in the audience, to make us feel superior to
Bambi, the unfortunate rape victim. After all, we
think, we're intelligent people. We’d never get
ourselves into such a situation. But the fact is that
rape can happen to all women — not only to the
Bambi’s out there. Rape can happen to us. Ms.
Magazine recently reported that 1 out of 4 college
women will be sexually assaulted on campus,
usually in a dorm or frat house, by fellow students
80% of the time.

Sliwa touched, but briefly, on the fact that, the
next morning, Bambi may very likely question her
own behavior, and wonder if indeed she had been
raped at all or whether she had somehow ‘‘asked
for it.’’ She may think herself at fault for being
stupid, for getting drunk. What Sliwa didn’t add
was that Bambi will need a great deal of support,
and possibly some counselling, to help her to
realize that she was not responsible for the actions
of the ‘‘hunters.”’

Another scenario Sliwa presented: a woman on
a date. She’s pretty smart, very aware. She senses
that she’s in trouble. She tells her gropey escort
that she has her period. It doesn’t tum him off.
She tries to call a friend to come and pick her up,

   

Interviews by Pamela Kelley

But, her scenario assumes a single, unarmed
assailant. And she didn’t mention that, in real life,
you cannot predict how you will react. Sometimes,
a sudden violent attack can be paralyzing. You
may be terrified, in shock. You can’t move. You
can hardly breathe. You become a victim. You
know you should have gouged out his eyes, but
you didn’t. You failed.

Please, give yourself th» permission to not fight
back. We’re not all tough and invulnerable like
Lisa Sliwa. We have fears and weaknesses. We
make mistakes. We sometimes show poor judge-
ment. But we must keep reminding ourselves that
crime is the fault of the criminal, not of the victim
who somehow doesn’t prevent it from happening.

A self-defense demonstration may be helpful for
the kind of street crime a woman may face in the
big city. But on a campus like Washington & Lee,
the real problem is date rape. And it’s difficult,
emotionally as well as physically, for a woman to
fight off her boyfriend. Sliwa didn’t address the
emotional side of the issue at all.

After all, most girls are raised to be pleasing.
We are taught to smile, to be nice. As girls be-
come teenagers, we learn how important it is to fit

in with a peer group, and, especially, how to ireat
teenage boys.

So Bambi is upstairs at a frat party, about to be
raped. How can we expect her to gouge out Bifi’s
eyes, when she’s very likely afraid to even scream
for fear of causing a scene? All of her friends are
downstairs. She doesn’t want them to see her in
the condition she’s in. What would they think?
What if they get angry at her? What if Biff is her
boyfriend, the man she has pledged herself to?
What if she feels that it’s her duty to make him

happy?

If she used Sliwa’s techniques, she’d very
likely be branded for the rest of her four years on
campus as the girl who cried rape, the one who
ruined the party. She’s the one who scratched up
Biff’s handsome face. Poor Biff. How many of her
friends would stand by her?

Before a woman can fight off a rape, she has
to knew that she has the right to. She has to know
that she’s worth fighting for. That she can make
the choice whether and when to engage in sexual
activity. That protecting her body and her self-
esteem are more important than causing a social
faux pas.

All in all,.Sliwa puts too-heavy of: a burden on
the victim. She mocks women who try to fight
back by meekly beating on men’s strong chests. |
don’t feel we should ridicule a victim for not
defending herself ‘‘well enough.’’ Let’s keep the
responsibility for ending crime where it belongs -
- on the behavior of the criminals.

To this end, Sliwa did say — and if this is the
only thing the audience came away with that night,
she’ll have done a lot of good: ‘‘No means No.
Yes means Yes.’’ She added to the men, that, if
the woman is not in a condition to make that
decision, ‘Don’t make it for her.’’

Ex-POW visits campus

 

From W&L News Office

Charlie Plumb, former naval
flight officer and POW in Viet-
nam, gave a speech titled ‘‘Over-
coming Adversity’’ in Washington
and Lee University’s Lee Chapel
last night.

Plumb received his commission
from the United States Naval Aca-
demy in 1964 where he graduated
with a B.S, degree. He went to
flight training in Florida, Missis-
sippi, Texas and eventually to San
Diego where he was trained to
pilot the F4-B Phantom, the

 

Navy’s newest supersonic intercep-
tor. There he also helped start the
Navy’s ‘‘Top Gun’’ school. He
left for Vietnam in November
1966 as a flight officer aboard the
USS Kitty Hawk.

On May 19, 1967, Plumb was
shot down south of Hanoi while
on a fighter cover mission. He was
captured immediately and taken to
the Hanoi prison complex where
he spent the next five years and
nine months in captivity. During
his imprisonment, Plumb distin-
guished himself among his fellow
prisoners as a professional in

underground communication. In
1970, he was appointed chaplain
of his prison unit and served in
that capacity for two years.

Plumb was repatriated on Feb.
28, 1973. Since then he has spo-
ken to more than 3000 audiences,
including religious, business, civic
and student groups. Through hu-
morous anecdotes of POW life,
Plumb demonstrates how positive
attitudes and self-esteem can over-
come great odds in a prison camp
or in everyday life.

The speech was sponsored by

Liquor tax takes effect

 

By Kick Peltz
Staf! Reporter

A federal tax increase pushed the
prices on beer, wine and distilled
spirits up Jan. 1, but the change will
have little impact on sales in Lexing-
ton, report merchants and students.

The tax increase is levied directly
on the manufacturers. Whether or not
the increase is passed on to the con-
sumers depends on manufacturers,
distributors and retailers.

Miles Nye, owner of Kelly’s
Comer, called the increased beer
costs ‘‘outrageous.’’ He said that tax
rate increases only account for about
five of the $8 to $12 rise in keg
prices, and brewery markups explain
the difference,

‘They’re doing this hoping it will
be ‘simoke-screened’ by the federal
taxes,’’ Nye said of the markups.

The price on a keg of Busch beer
has zone from $34 to $42 at Kelly’s
Comer. Harris Teeter Assistant Man-
ager Larry Tomlin said that beer

At the first blackjack table, one
student looked over to another and
said, ‘‘I think you should stick with
that, it's 21."’

“‘Damn good thing,’’ said the
other. ‘These are my last two
chips.’’

Such was the case Tuesday night
in the General Headquarters, where
the Washington and Lee Superdance
Committee held its annual Casino
Night, an event designed to raise
money for the Jerry Lewis Muscular
Dystrophy charity.

The event, which netted
over $1,100 for the charity, allowed
W&L to students to gamble at such
games as blackjack, roulette, craps
and poker.

“For the $5 cover charge, you get

there has increased about 50 cents per
six pack.

An Anheuser-Busch spokesman
said Tuesday that in addition to the
higher tax rate, a ‘‘price increase is
needed to address increased costs that
we are experiencing for raw materi-
als, for labor, for fuel and for other
necessary goods and services."’

The Palms Manager Cindy Camp-
bell said that The Palms will not pass
the increase in liquor costs to its
customers,

‘‘We’re not increasing our prices
right now,’’ said Campbell, ‘‘As long
as we Can... we're going to absorb
the cost.’’

Costs have risen at all Virginia
Alcoholic Beverage Control stores
and local grocery and convenience
stores,

Prices in the biggest selling items
at ABC stores increased slightly,
according to Bureau of ABC Informa-
tion Officer William Gee. He said
750 milliliters of Bowman’s Virginia
Vodka went from $4.90 to $5.10 and
Seagram’s Extra Dry Gin rose from

$7.10 to $7.50. :

Some increases are less consistent,
According to the Jan. 1. Roanoke
Times & World News, Jack Daniel’s
black label increased $1.50 while the
green label increased $3.

Nye, Tomlin, Gee and local ABC
employee A. C. Manspile all agreed
that price increases have had little
effect on sales, and they don’t expect
any change.

‘‘We did not notice any stocking
up’’ at ABC stores prior to Jan. 1,
said Gee, other than the usual holi-
day rush.

Nye said he felt that consumers
would grow accustomed to the new

prices, especially because beer prices
are often already higher in other parts
of the country.

Samuel Rock, Kappa Sigma social
chairman, and Joshua MacFarland,
Phi Kappa Psi social committee mem-
ber, expressed the views of most
fraternity members: that price
increases are too small to affect con-
sumption.

ight raises $1,100

$10,000 in fake money, and two
beverage tickets,’’ said Superdance
Committee Co-Chairman Kennan
Walthall. ‘‘Then, at the end of the
night, we have an auction where
students bid for prizes with whatever
they win.”’

The prizes, which Walthall said
were donated by local businesses,
ranged from gift certificates to The
Palms to two Fancy Dress tickets,
valued at about $40 apiece.

The auction, which was held at
midnight, featured furious attempts by
students to pool their winnings, to
buy the more expensive prizes, such
as six tickets to the Superdance
weekend, which features a concert by
Drivin’ and Cryin’.

The last prize, seven free pizzas
from Frank’s was bought by a group
of students, headed by senior Laura
Lee Kinney, for over $400,000.

According to Walthall, one of the
reasons the event was much more
successful than in previous years
was because of scheduling

‘*We used to hold this thing right
before Thanksgiving Break,’’ he said.
‘The problems was, everyone was
trying to get last-minute work done
before they left, so they didn’t have
time.”’

Last year’s Casino Night netted
$534, according to Superdance Co-
Chairman Matt Wherry.

“Right now [about 9:30] there are
more people here than there were all
last year,’’ Walthall said.

By 10:15, there were so many
people in the GHQ, that many were
forced to wait for spots to open up at
several tables.

“I'd like to play one of these
games, but right now they’re all
full,’’ said senior Tim Halloran.

The new Lenfest Center for the
Performing Arts will open on sched-
ule later this month despite its unfin-
ished appearance. Noted American
musician Robert Shaw will be guest
conductor for ‘he premier concert on
Saturday, January 19.

‘‘There is still work to be done
all over the building,’’ said Washing-
ton and Lee’s Capita! Planning Direc-
tor Frank Parsons. While the center
may not be in perfect condition, most
major construction is complete. The
main auditorium is nearly finished,
and, according to Parsons, there
should be nothing standing in the
way of next Saturday’s concert.

Dr. Albert Gordon, theater depart-
ment chairman, moved his division’s
offices across the street in mid-De-
cember. All theater classes, along
with many choral and instrumental
rehearsals, are currently being held in
the Lenfest Center.

“It’s exhilarating,’’ commented
Gordon. ‘‘You overlook the [con-
struction] problems because the whole
experience is just so exciting.We have
all risen above the frustration.”’

Parsons was reluctant to place a
specific date as to when the Lenfest
Center would be completed. ‘*We’ve
had a great deal of help from the
contractor in trying to keep to the
schedule, Parsons explained. ‘‘That,
of course, does not forgive thetn for

Council to open
communication

 

By Greg Patterson
Staff Reporter

A committee has been formed by
the city of Lexington, W&L and VMI
in order to establish formal commu-
nication channels between the schools
and the city.

The Lexington Community Coun-
cil will consist of the dean of stu-
dents from W&L, the commandant of
VMI, a student from each school, a
member of the city’s downtown dev-
elopment advisory group, two citi-
zens, a member of the local clergy,
the mayor and the city manager.

According to City Manager Jon T.
Ellestad, the council’s first meeting
will be on Jan. 23 with W&L Dean
of Students David Howison serving
as the first chairman.

Among the issues Ellestad sees
the new council addressing is “all the
negativism" surrounding city- -school
relations. He believes the council will
try to publicize joint projects between
the city and the schools.

Ellestad also said he hopes to get
input from the committee regarding
student housing in the city, a con-

troversial topic that led to a year-
long moratorium on large-capacity
housing applications.

One goal in creating the council,
according to Ellestad, was to keep it
relatively small, but that it may bring
in advisors from time to time to help
address specific topics.

Ellestad said he hopes the coun-
cil will be able to solve problems
before they get too big. "There’s
always room to talk about anything."

the theater classes now being held in
the building.

Along with the theater department
classes and offices, the center, once
completed, will feature a split level
gatehouse, the Kamen art collection,
a 422 seat main auditorium (with the
capability of an additional 50 seats),
a state-of-the-art theatrical stage, and
a bridge connecting it to the main
campus across the street.

The work continuing on the center
will be completed in full by the
building’s dedication ceremonies set
for May, according to Parsons.

Robert Shaw served as music
director of the Atlanta Symphony
Orchestra for 21 years. During that
time, he garnered widespread acclaim
through national and _ international
tours. His concert next weekend will
feature a joint effort by all of Wash-

ington and Lee’s choral groups (a
total of 109 students) along with the
University-Rockbridge | Symphony
Orchestra. The program will also
highlight pianist Timothy Gaylard, an
associate professor of music at W&L,
and soprano soloist Amy Cochrane,
the music department’s voice adjunct.

The concert’ will feature
Beethoven’s ‘Egmont Overture,” the
third movement of Rachmaninov’s
Piano Concerto #2, the third move-
ment of Bemstein’s ‘‘Chichester
Psalms,’’ and Poulenc’s ‘‘Gloria.”’

Seats for next Saturday’s concert
have been completely booked by reser-
vation, but tickets are still available

vations for the rehearsal can be made

Rhodes recipients were called out
alphabetically. When Lopes heard the
name of Goodwin Liu, a winner from
Stanford University, she quickly tried
to determine if Lopes followed Liu
or if she had not been picked.

‘‘T was so nervous and I couldn’t
figure out how to spell Liu,’’ Lopes
said. ‘‘I was so shocked to hear my
name that I didn’t hear the next two
names.”’

In the next four days, Lopes cele-
brated by returning home, writing a
paper and taking a quiz and three
final exams that her professors had
faxed to her.

In her essay for the scholarship,
Lopes wrote that she wanted to pur-
sue a career in journalism.

“I wrote that I wanted to do
something that would directly affect
people and help them understand
what’s going on around them,’’ she
said.

Lopes is a candidate for a bache-
lor of arts degree in politics and
journalism and has been a leader in
numerous campus activities.

Lopes is a consistent member of

A four-year letter winner with the
women’s cross country team, Lopes
recieved the 1990 Women’s Cross

From W&L News Office

 

The Washington and Lee Univer-
sity Alumni Office and the University
Bookstore have put together a care
package for W&L alumni currently
on active duty in the Persian Gulf.

According to alumni staff as-
sociate Joel Smith, the original idea
was to send over some hats with the
W&L logo on them. ‘‘Then we
thought why not send a more sub-
stantial care package to our alumni,
with some news of what's going on

at W&L, and the project snowballed
from there.”’

Included in the package is the
most recent issue of the alumni
magazine, a golf cap and a W&L
water bottle — complete with Gator-
ade.

An initial mailing has been made
to nine alumni — two serving in the
Marines and seven in the Army, with
class years ranging from 1983 to
1989. Smith reports that the alumni
office hopes to keep sending care
packages in the future as addresses
become available.

Since sending the care
packages, Smith has added a few
names to his list of W&L alumni
serving with the armed forces in the
Persian Gulf. Following is a list of
names and addresses. Smith encour-
ages students to write the alumni.

- Changes lead Generals to tourney win

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

Coming off a 30-day break for
exams, Washington and Lee head
basketball coach Verne Canfield
decided to make some changes with
his team.

The Generals had struggled to a
3-5 start, so Canfield decided that a
lineup change was in order.

For the 22nd Annual Washington
and Lee Invitational, Canfield
changed his starting lineup, which
had been composed of five seniors.

He moved guard Jim Casey and
forward Craig Hatfield to the bench.
In their place, Canfield inserted 6-
foot-3 sophomore Keith Faulkner at
small forward and the only freshman
on the roster, Paul Baker at shooting
guard.

The changes paid off immediately,
as the Generals won the Invitational
before dropping a 71-69 heart-breaker
to Old Dominion Athletic Conference
rival Bridgewater Tuesday.

‘The lineup changes worked, and
that’s a credit to everyone involved,”’
said Canfield. ‘‘It needed to be done,
and it tumed out to be the healthy
thing to do.”’

‘The way I look at it, something
had to change,’’ said Hatfield. ‘‘If it
was me, that’s just the way it is.
Now I’m coming off the bench trying
to do the same things I did when I
started.””

By moving Casey and Hatfield to
the bench, Canfield increased the
experience and depth of his team at
the same time. In the three games,
W&L got 97 points off the bench.

Against Bridgewater, W&L started
slowly and fell behind 43-36 at the
half. Only the outside shooting of

Hart joins 1

Casey kept W&L in the game. Casey
hit five of six three pointers to keep
the Generals close.

In the second half, W&L tied the
game with 14:21 left by going on an
8-1 run to even things at 51. Sparked
by senior forward Ed Hart, who
scored his 1,000th career point on a
free throw with 17:37 left in the
second half, the Generals then took a
58-55 lead.

The lead didn’t last long, though,
as costly turnovers led to four quick
points by Bridgewater’s Neil Burke
~ sparked the Eagles to a 63-60

‘‘We turned the ball over too
much and committed too many dumb
fouls,’’ said Canfield, ‘‘but we were
still in the game with a chance to
win at the end.’’

W&L fought back to tie the game
at 69-69 with 2:33 left on two free
throws by junior Courtney Penn. The
game stayed tied until the final min-
ute. W&L had a chance to go ahead

but turned the ball over with 37
seconds left.

The Eagles ran the clock down to
nine seconds before calling time out.
When play resumed, BC freshman
Chad Edwards broke free in the lane
and was fouled before he could score
with four seconds left. After a W&L
time out, Edwards calmly hit both
free throws, giving the Eagles a 71-
69 win, ending W&L’s three game
winning streak.

“I am not discouraged by the
loss,”” said Canfield. ‘*I’m disappoint-
ed for our players. We’re on the right
track offensively and defensively. Our
confidence factor needs to be worked
on.”’

Casey led W&L with a career-
high 21 points on a school record

,000-point

club in two-point loss

It is a special occasion when a
basketball player scores 1,000 points
in his career.

‘To score 1,000 points is not an
easy achievement,’’ said W&L head
coach Verne. Canfield. ‘‘It-is. a. big
moment and a well deserved moment
of recognition.”’

Tuesday night’s Old Dominion
Athletic Conference game between
Washington & Lee and Bridgewater
saw that plateau eclipsed twice, and
tonight’s ODAC game between W&L
and Roanoke could see the plateau
topped again.

On Tuesday in Bridgewater, with
40 seconds left in the first half
Bridgewater junior forward Todd
Rush stepped to the free throw line
and hit the first of two free throws
for the 1,000th point of his career.

Early in the second half, W&L

senior Ed Hart stepped to the same
free throw line and hit two free
throws to give him 1,000 points in
his career. Hart will be honored be-
fore tonight’s game with Roanoke.

Hart becomes the eighteenth play-
er in W&L history to reach the 1,-
000-point mark. Hart now has 1,004
points in his career.

“‘Ivs a nice accomplishment,
said Hart. ‘‘But it’s kind. of overshad-
owed by the loss. I’m trying to keep
things in the right perspective. Indi-
vidual honors don’t mean much when
the team isn’t doing well.’’

Tonight, with 11 points, senior
guard Mike Holton can become the
nineteenth member of W&L’s 1,000-
point club.

‘*By the second half of [tonight’s
game], we could have three 1,000
point scorers on the floor at the same
time,’’ said Canfield. ‘‘Even though
we may be going through a tough
time right now, these players have
had a lot of good times as well.’’

seven three point goals. In his last
five games, Casey is 24 of 36 from
three point range and is averaging
over 14 points a game.

“Coach [Canfield] wanted us to
look for the quick shot in transition
and re-establish the three pointer as
part of the offense,’’ said Casey. ‘‘As
long as I was playing shooting guard,
I kind of took it upon myself to get
us going with the three pointer.’’

“It is obvious Jim has created a
nice role for himself,’’ said Canfield.
“*He’s got the hot hand right now,
and we've got to look to help Jim
get his shots.’’

Hart added 12 points and nine
rebounds. He becomes the 18th
1,000-point scorer in school history.

In the Invitational, the Generals
never trailed in winning their ninth
title in 10 years. W&L sprinted out
to double-figure leads in both games
only to see the lead whittled to one
point in the waning moments.

In Friday’s semifinal, a 76-75 win
over Swarthmore, the Generals jum-
ped out to a 42-26 halftime lead
sparked by Faulkner’s rebounding and
Casey’s outside shooting.

Faulkner grabbed five of his team-
high eight rebounds and handed out
three assists in the first half. Casey
warmed to his sixth-man’s role quick-
ly, hitting on all four of his three
point shots.

The Generals held on for the win
behind 18 second half points on nine
of 10 shooting from Hatfield, who
finished with 19 on the night.

In Saturday’s championship game
against Hartwick, the Generals again
jumped out to a halftime lead. Baker
scored the first six points of the
game on three pointers, and the se-
niors led a balanced attack. Chris
Jacobs and Casey led the way with

10 points each, while Hart and Mike
Holton chipped in nine and seven
points respectively.

In the second half, W&L got
back-to-back three pointers from
Holton and Baker to get a 57-41 lead

early in the second half. The lead
grew to 64-45 with 14:35 left when
tournament MVP Tom Spain brought
Hartwick back.

Hartwick cut the lead to 80-77
with 4:40 to play. Spain scored 19

second-half points to lead the charge.

But the Generals survived the run
and hit six of eight free throws down
the stretch in winning 94-92.

Hart led W&L with 22 points, 13
in the second half, and 12 rebounds.
Jacobs added 18 on eight of 14
shooting, Holton 15 and Casey 13 off
the bench. W&L dominated Hartwick
on the boards, outrebounding the
Warriors 40-23. Hart and Jacobs
made the all-tournament team.

‘We did a lot of good things,”’
said Hart. ‘‘We had a good inside-
outside balance. But at the same
time, we were too inconsistent. We
had good spurts and then we got
complacent.’’

W&L, 5-6, 1-3 on the season, will
attempt to reach the .500 mark again
tonight against Roanoke in the Warn-
er Center at 7:30. The Generals also
play host to Virginia Wesleyan Satur-
day afternoon at 3:00.

Charleston swims by WL

 

By Randall Ellis
Staff Reporter

 

In their first dual meet of 1991
the men and women’s swim teams
both came up short in a meet at the
College of Charleston.

The men lost 96-69 while the
women were edged out 92-84.

Despite the losses, head coach
Page Remillard said he was pleased
with his teams’ performances.

“Tt is still early in the dual meet
season,”” he said. ‘‘Although we had
some strong performances, we used
this meet to gain a prospective of
were we stand. Now that we have
that we can begin to plan how each
swimmer should be performing.’’

In the men’s meet, brothers Doug
and Larry Brown each tumed in a
first place finish. Doug, a junior, won
the 500-yard freestyle with a time of
4:58.25, while Larry, a freshman,
took the 200-yard backstroke with a
time of 2:22.23.

Freshman Matt Appel achieved a

was joined by sophomore Andrew
Pearson and seniors Jim Dunlevy and
Tomas Perez to take first in the 400-
yard freestyle relay.

On the women’s side, junior Jodi
Herring won the 500-yard free with a
time of 5:44.56, senior Sharon Cole-
man had a winning time of 2:25.45
in the 200-yard backstroke, while
sophomore Claire Dudley clocked a
2:36.88 to win the 200-yard breast-
stroke.

Herring also teamed up with se-
nior Kristen Wagner, sophomore
Christine Gorman and junior Louise
Adamson to win the 400-yard free-
style relay.

Remillard said he feels that his
teams’ weaknesses are their small
numbers, but the strong attitudes and
dedication of the team members
should make up for this.

‘‘The Washington and Lee swim-
ming program is at a tuming point,”
he said. ‘‘Having graduated a good
number of strong swimmers in the
last few years our focus for the 90s
is to rebuild and get as much out of
each swimmer as possible. If all goes
the right way, this will be our weak-

wr

est year of the decade,”’ ‘
The women’s chance of defending
their Old Dominion Athletic Confér-

ence Championship depends on the
other ODAC teams, Remillard said.
A

“If the other teams in the conf¢r-
ence have a problem or two we stand
a chance of winning the champion-
ship again, but if we are going {o
lose the championship this will be the
year in which it happens. It could
prove to be a dog fight,’’ he added.

Remillard said he feels that the

goals of the individual swimmer are

what is important. He does not plan

to alter his line-ups in order to outwit

other teams, but devise lines accord-
ing to individuals goals.

‘‘We will swim fast to attain our
goals and how that fits in to our
record is of no concern. What I want
from the team is lifetime personal
best from each swimmer.”’

On Saturday both the men (0-'])
and the women (1-1) will travel to
UNC-Charlotte for a dual meet.

It is now the first Thursday of

when the ball goes up, it is almost
guaranteed that the biggest crowd of
the season will be on hand.

But while everyone in Lexington
is treating the game like the Final
Four, Verne Canfield and the Gener-
als look at it as just one more game
on a 27-game schedule. But the team
will admit, it’s nice to get that kind
of support.

‘This is just another game,’’ said
senior co-captain Craig Hatfield. ‘‘It’s
not the beginning or the end of our

entertainment during timeouts. Last year, the Fans saw the
Generals beat the Maroons by nine. Staff photo by Chris Leiphart.

season. But the crowd will get us
more cmotional and .intense.’’

‘While it’s just another game,”’
said senior forward Ed Hart, ‘‘it’s
also a big game. As a team, we can’t
get caught up in the hype and fan-
fare. We have to have our concentra-
tion.”’

To tum to the game itself for a
moment. W&L comes in at 5-6, 1-3
in the ODAC. Roanoke comes in 6-
3, 0-1.

For W&L, this group of seniors

has never lost to Roanoke in Lexing-
ton, and to make it four out of four,
the Generals will need to hit the
boards and rebound. Roanoke brings
five players who are taller than 6-
foot-5.

‘*This could be the toughest team
we've played to this point,’’ said
Canficld. ‘‘They have more depth
than I’ve ever seen in a Roanoke
team, and it’s young depth. They are
getting great balance, and they have

right now.”’

Roanoke’s size has allowed them
a seven-rebound advantage over their
opponents this season.

‘Obviously, rebounding will be a
key,’’ said Hart. ‘*We need to con-
centrate on that, especially since we
got outrebounded against Bridge-
water.”’

Back to the crowd.

For the past two seasons, more
than 2,000 people have jammed the
Warner Center to root the Generals
on against the Maroons.

Most notably among the group
have been the group of 30 or so
students known as the Unknown
Fans. While their identity may be

very visible.

“The Unknown Fans are a
healthy tradition,’’ said Canfield.
“We just ask that they keep every-
thing they do in good taste and in
good spirit and stay off the floor.

“This is more than just a game,
it’s a happening that is good for the
student body and the faculty,’’ said
Canfield. ‘‘It’s great to see everyone
out and enjoying themselves at an
athletic event."’

‘We need a big ODAC win and
tonight is as big a conference. game
as we've played,’’ said Hatfield. ‘‘To
get a big win at home in front of a
big crowd would put us back on the
Tight track.’’

W&L student back in grade school

Spanish-speaking sophomore shares skill with small students

 

By Ashley Harper
Staff Reporter

 

A Washington and Lee sopho-
more has gone back to elementary
school.

Andrew Roper is sharing his per-
sonal experiences and knowledge of
Spanish speaking countries to teach
Fairfield Elementary School third and
fourth graders.

“This is the right age to intro-
duce a foreign language because their
interest will spark, and they will
continue it in junior high and high
school,’’ said Roper.

Roper said the course aim is to
familiarize the students with . Span-
ish and the Latin American cultures.

Each class period is split into
different sections. The students leam
about culture, help each other review
previous material and then leam new
information.

‘‘We start them out with the
basics such as ‘What is your name?”’,
and ‘How are you,” said Roper.
‘Then we teach them what they want
to learn.”’

Roper has taught the elementary
school children movie titles and mu-
sic lyrics. He has also taught them
how to say Teenage Mutant Ninja

Dreams So Real |
reaches Gloryline

 

By Andrew Keller
Staff Reporter

 

With the increasing popularity of
Athens and Atlanta based bands like
Drivin’ and Cryin’ and the Black
Crowes, it was shrewd of Dreams So
Real to release their second album,
Gloryline, as a successful follow-up
to Rough Night in Jericho.

Although there were no changes
in the membership of this trio, the
band did change from producer Bill
Drescher to Joe Hardy. While the
Drescher album is alright, its sound
tends to lean toward the washy pling
pling feel of older REM. This style
coupled with songs as unimaginative
and chugging as the Smithereens
created a very average debut record.

Hardy however took Dreams So
Real back to the roots U2 didn’t
know they had by recording in Mem-
phis. Hopefully it was this move
from L.A. and not the manipulations
of a hit-record hungry producer that
inspired the John Cougar rhythms and
melodies that appear on this album.

Unfortunately though, __ their
change in songwriting seems to stem
from the varying degrees in which
they borrow other peoples music.
