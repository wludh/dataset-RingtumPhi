Low voter

From Staff Reports

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

 

 

Revisions to the student body constitution failed in
referendum Wednesday, because less than half the student

body voted.

Only 160 students voted on the proposals. The Voting
Regulations Board did not tally the votes, since at least
half the student body must vote in order for a revision to

pass.

Thomas Spurgeon, member of the committee that
prepared the revisions, said, ‘‘It’s very difficult to get
students at W&L to vote, especially for something that

complicated.,”’

On the ballot were 10 proposals dealing with Execu-
tive Committee quorum, succession, relations with the
Publications Board, and executive session. Measures on
the latter issue clarified when the EC could close its
door, as the current restrictions are ambiguous.

Senior EC Rep. Willard Dumas said that since the
revisions failed, ‘‘It will be left up to each EC to
interpret the constitution as we did two years ago on

succession.”’

Dumas said confusion over when the vote would take

place contributed to the low tumout.

The referendum was originally scheduled for March
26-28, but was moved to April 6. On April 6, VRB
Chairman Andrew Gaffney forgot to set up polling
places, EC President Tom Hatcher said.

The referendum was rescheduled for a third time and

set for Wednesday.

EC President-elect Giles Perkins said he does not
think the failure of the referendum will have much effect

on the EC.

‘The changes that were proposed were good ones,”’
Perkins said, ‘‘but [their failure] will not change how the

EC operates.”’

The current EC handles committee appointment
interviews and deliberations in closed session, but posts
voting records. Dumas speculated on future ECs adopting

a different policy.

‘‘When people are appointed to committees in the
dark, and the EC doesn’t publish voting records, you will
have to ask your rep why and how they voted,"’ Dumas

said.

EC denies second ACLU request

 

By Greg Patterson
Staff Reporter

 

The Executive Committee Monday
rejected a request by the Washington
and Lee chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union for $160 saying
the group should be able to support
its activities through member, not EC,
support.

The move came after the EC last
week gave the ACLU chapter $30 of
the $500 requested. The money was
allotted to pay for publicity for an
‘‘open mike’’ Speak-Out on the topic
of the Law School recruitment policy.

EC members who voted in favor
of the $30 donation last week said
they did so because the Speak-Out’s
purpose was not to support the goals
of the national ACLU organizations
and would benefit the entire student

body.
On Monday, ACLU Chapter
Founder and President Andrew

Schneider asked for $160: $60 to

publicize a second Speak-Out and a
speaker, and $100 to take the
speaker, Ken Willis of the Virginia
ACLU, four professors, and four
students to dinner.

Schneider said he requested
money for the dinner because Willis
will not be paid for his speech.

When asked whether he had re-
quested money from chapter members
in order to support its activities, a
recommendation made by EC mem-
bers last week, Schneider said he had
collected about $125, but wished to
save it to be used for ‘‘more politi-
cal’’ activities the chapter could spon-
sor.

Senior EC Rep. Willard Dumas
made a motion to give the group
$160, but the motion was not sec-
onded.

Then a motion was made by se-
nior Rep. John Fialcowitz to grant
$30 to support another Speak-Out.

EC President Tom Hatcher, before
he called for a vote, said he consid-
ered last week’s $30 allotment a ‘‘re-

It’s that time of year again. For
the fifteenth straight year, Washington
and Lee students are on the phone to
alumni in the Annual Fund Phona-
thon, asking for contributions.

“Calling alumni is a lot more
effective than direct mail notices,”’
said Alumni Fund Director Timothy
McMahon. ‘‘It’s a lot harder to say
no to a fellow W&L student than it
is to throw away junk mail.’’

As of Tuesday, McMahon said,
the Phonathon has been surprisingly
successful.

‘‘Through the first three days, we
have gotten 258 pledges totalling
almost $21,000,’’ he said. ‘‘I wasn't
expecting that kind of success.’’

The university has set June 30 as
the Annual Fund deadline with a goal
of $2,165,000. That translates to
about 8.5 percent of the university's
annual operating budget.

According to McMahon, the phon-
athon is mostly directed toward recent
alumni classes, which make up over
20 percent of the entire alumni body.
This group, however, also has the
lowest percentage of contributors, he
said.

The school has also attempted in

recent years to solicit pledges from
each senior class.

‘‘We want the seniors to learn to
contribute before they leave campus.
The amount of the contribution is not
as important as that they get in the
habit of giving to the school,’ he
said,

‘We understand that it’s often
difficult for people just out of college
to contribute, but even small contri-
butions add up to a lot of money,”’
he said.

W&L ranks last among the top 25
national liberal arts colleges in the
percentage of alumni that contribute,
and the school has made a ‘‘consid-
erable effort’’ to raise the percentage,
McMahon said.

McMahon said he hopes to hold
even more such events, because of
their success rate.

‘Many other schools do much
more calling than W&L does. I hope
to begin having another phonathon
each fall as well,’’ he said.

Equally surprising has been the
amount of student support. Each night
there have been more student volun-
teers than there are phones for them
to use.

‘Part of the reason that we hold
this during the spring is because it is
a much more relaxed time, and it’s
easier to find volunteers,’’ he said.

prieve so you could collect dues from

again would open the way for a
“never ending battle’’ with the
ACLU continually requesting funds
for events.

The motion was rejected, 8-2,
with Dumas and Fialcowitz voting in
favor, according to Dumas.

Schneider later said Hatcher ‘‘ap-
parently changed his story’’ about for
what the original $30 was. Schneider
said the money was not a ‘“‘reprieve’’
because the ACLU chapter had al-

ready paid for the Speak-Out, but
was actually a reimbursement.

Schneider said the first $30 was
granted because Speak-Out was a
non-partisan, non-controversial activity
and that EC members who changed
their votes this week were ‘‘pressured
by the ‘My View’ column in last
week’s Ring-tum Phi.”’

IFC yanks
$10,000 in
Contact aid

 

By Jennifer Mayo
Staff Reporter

 

The Interfraternity Council an-
nounced Tuesday night that it intends
to withdraw its $10,000 annual sup-
port of the Contact Committee.

IFC President Greg Hicks told
Executive Committee President Tom
Hatcher during Tuesday’s IFC meet-
ing that the council voted before
spring term to stop funding the com-
mittee for two reasons, inadequate
representation on the Contact selec-
tion committee and, as a result, a
lack of fraternity involvement and
interest with the Contact program.

EC President Tom Hatcher feels
that the decision was abrupt.

“I feel like they were little kids
who decide that they don’t want to
play anymore, so they just pick up
their toys and leave,’’ he said.

Hatcher said that the withdrawal
is not in the university’s best interest
and that the disagreement could have
been more constructively resolved,
but Hicks argues that the IFC’s role
in the Contact selection has become
increasingly inadequate, and it is time
that something be done.

When the IFC founded Contact in
the late sixties, the school was all
male and primarily Greek and the IFC
appointed all Contact members. Over
the past several years, despite the fact
that there is a smaller percentage of
fraternity men in W&L’s student

of the selection process.”

Hicks explained that Greek interest
in the Contact Committee is decreas-
ing and will continue to decrease
over the years if the fraternities do
not become more active in the orga-
nization. People do not want to give
money whvn they don’t know where
it is going and have nothing to show
for it, Hicks said.

Hatcher said he understands the
IFC’s concern, but he would have
liked to have been able to discuss the
problem before such drastic action
was taken.

‘The EC appoints the board and
has always made sure that there is
adequate Greek _representation.’’
Hatcher said. ‘‘I feel like this is a
misunderstanding we all could have
avoided with some discussion.”’

Contact Coordinator Charles Kran-
ich said that he has seen this problem
coming for several years.

‘Tt might be different if Pan-
hellenic and all other student organi-
zations had to pay equal amounts,”’
Kranich said, ‘‘but the fraternities
seem to be carrying the load for the
entire student body, and they don’t
feel that they get enough recognition
for that.’’

Another member of the IFC com-
mented that the fraternities already
make contributions above other stu-
dents in areas such as the univer-
sity’s social life. They seem to be
carrying a disproportionate load, he
said.

Hicks feels that such a sizable

agrees and rejected the proposal.

Hicks agreed, saying that the $10,000
could be used for the fraternities
more productively elsewhere.

‘‘We want something to give fra-
ternities a good name and to raise
interest,’ Hicks said. ‘‘The EC was
not willing to give us thai, so we're
still considering, but I don’t know if
we will change our minds or not.”’

Three fraternities will sponsor
a Sherman’s March to the Sea
party Saturday night at Chi Psi
while Kappa Alpha hosts its Old
South formal.

The Sherman’s March to the
Sea party, a venture by Chi Psi,
Phi Gamma Delta and Delta Tau
Delta, is a new concept, while the
Old South formal is an annual,
national KA tradition.

Chi Psi Social Chairman
Kevin Fliess said the party is
intended to celebrate the Union
victory in the Civil War.

The Sherman’s March to the
Sea theme refers to the Union
general's march through the Sou-
th, a campaign that included the
burning of Atlanta. However,
Fliess said the theme is not in-
tended as hostile.

‘There won't by any bel-
ligerent ruckus or northern hell
raising,’ he said.

KA isn’t taking the new theme
as an offense, according to KA
senior Fraser Bowen.

and Sherman's March to the Sea parties.

“I’m just taking it in good
humor,’’ Bowen said. ‘‘They
mean it in the spirit of fun."

KA junior Trey Cox agreed

“If we're going to have our
party, we don’t have a right to
criticize theirs,’ Cox said, ‘‘I
think you can find merit on both
sides.”’

Students at Auburn University

last week dealt with the KA Old
South party there differently.

According to Auburn Director
of Student Affairs Grant Davis,
flowers around campus and an
announcement in the ' student
newspaper brought a number of
students out to protest the KA
Old South parade along the
school’s College Street.

University officials were
notified of the protest, and the
event occurred without incident,
Davis said.

At W&L, conflicts seem con
fined within fraternities planning
the Sherman’s March to the Sea
party.

‘The fact that the party is on
the same weekend as Old South

just happens to be a coin-
cidence,’’ Fliess said.
But Fiji sophomore Darren

Johnson said the party was inten-
tionally planned for the same
weekend as Old South.

‘T don’t believe it’s in good
taste to support Sherman’s march
when it was just a pillaging raid
on the South,’’ Johnson said. ‘‘]
don't support the party and |
won't be there,”’

Richard Hughes, Fiji’s new
social chairman, refused to com-
ment on the party, saying he
didn’t believe in everything it
represented.

‘Some people are going sim-
ply because it’s a social event,’’
Johnson said. ‘‘They aren’t taking
the Sherman’s March theme too
seriously.”’

 

 

 
OPINION

No one else
to blame

Where were you from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Wednesday,
May 1, 1991?

That’s the question future generations of Washington
and Lee students will ask us as a student body when they
inherit the ambiguities of our student body constitution.

But who cares? Obviously not the current student body.

The 160 votes cast in Wednesday’s referendum were
not enough for the Voting Regulations Board to bother
tallying. The sum fell drastically short of the one-half of
the student body that must vote to amend the constitution.

Okay. Maybe you didn’t know. We admit that Phi
stories on constitutional revisions are not always as
interesting as Talkback — less pictures, to be sure. But
the issue is important, or we wouldn’t cover it at all.

The proposals made by the Constitutional Revisions
Committee appearing on the ballot were vital to update
the constitution and clear up some very vague areas about
how student government works.

One proposed amendment, for an example of which we
were particularly fond, determined when the Executive
Committee can enter executive session, thus excluding Phi
reporters and others. The constitution states that the EC
can close its door only ‘‘in the case of possible honor
violations.” That means every time the EC enters
executive session for appointment interviews and
deliberations, as it now does, it violates the constitution.

We do not advocate executive session for the entire
appointment process, but we do like to see the EC follow
the rules. Now W&L student government is faced with
separate de jure and de facto constitutions. Under such a
system, who will draw the line on EC actions? If the
constitution can be so blatantly violated in one respect, it
can be equally abused in any other. Who will intervene
when a future EC decides to close the door while it
allocates student dollars?

The fault for this tragic mishap can be laid on many
doorsteps. The VRB amnesia that postponed one vote, and
sparse EC publicity on the last vote, didn’t help.

The most serious fault of all, however, lies with the
apathetic student body. Apathy has not been a symptom of
poor polling organization, rather a cause. The first
postponement of the vote happened because only one
student outside the Phi and student government showed up
for the revisions forum in Lee Chapel mandated by the
constitution. It happened to be a beautiful, warm day, and
the students playing Frisbee outside the chapel didn’t think
the forum was important enough to come in.

Even the revisions committee members, which should
have seen more than anyone the need for these
amendments, have been stricken with this same strain of
apathy. Of five we contacted after Wednesday’s vote (the
sixth graduated), three didn’t know the results and, of
those, two claimed they did not remember what the
revisions they had written were about.

We don’t expect everyone to become avid readers of
student government news, or even to know every EC
member by name. We don’t expect anyone to be able to
recite the constitution chapter and verse, or even the
White Book without a copy handy. But sometimes, at
W&L and in the world in general, things come up that we
have to concern ourselves with to fulfil our obligations as
good citizens in a democratic system. Constitutional
amendments are like that; they’re important, whether it’s
the U.S. Constitution or the W&L student body.

At a time when student autonomy is said to be in
crisis, and student leaders are working desperately to
reestablish the confidence of alumni and administrators,
the student body could do no worse than express utter
apathy toward the supreme laws that govern student life
and protect student rights at W&L.

Offers seven pearls of wisdom to Sbarlets

 

The Sbar Side
By Jon Sbar

 

As I begin the first paragraph of my last Phi
article, my eyes are so blurred with tears that I can
barely see my computer terminal. My hands are
shaking like fig trees in the wind and every so of-
ten I emit a primal scream. I think of all the great
articles I should have written, but never did. Like
the one I had planned about the buildings and
grounds guy (the one with the baseball sized tobac-
co plug) who pulls a rotating pitchfork all over the
colonnade behind a tractor, putting little tiny holes
in the grass. I think of all the literary allusions that
I will never drop. Oh, WOE is me! I feel like two
ragged claws scraping across the dark surface of a
chalkboard in Payne Hall. I feel like this all too
solid flesh may melt and thaw. I feel like finding
out what a fig tree shaking in the wind looks like.

I realize that my first paragraph was a little
dramatic, but it is true that I’m upset about my Phi
career ending. Where else am I going to find a
newspaper that indulges my irresponsible and taste-
less writing style? With The Weekly World News,
that’s where. I’ve already signed a lucrative con-
tract which included a big signing bonus. I have
even started working on my first story --- Preg-
nant Man Carrying Elvis in Womb - Doctors have
heard the fetus singing ‘‘I ain't nothing but a
hound dog.”

Totally
Disappointing

Dear Editor:

I was very disappointed with the entertain-
ment (or attempt at entertainment) in the Pavilion
Friday night. The opening band was hopelessly
monotonous and annoying, which made the wait
for Pauly Shore all the more infuriating.

Shore opened his act with a generous dose of
profanity and never progressed. In fact, his entire
show was a tasteless exercise in vulgarity, which
might have been bearable had he demonstrated
any talent or sense of humor, which he never
did.

I feel especially bad for the ladies in the
audience who could only have been alienated,
repulsed, and embarrassed by Shore’s crass
sexism.

I know some people asked for their money

 

they have also requested that I write an article
soliciting a replacement. Can you believe that?
Talk about adding insult to injury. I gave them the
best years of my life. A man is not a fruit (but if
he was I’d want to be a mango). They can’t just
eat the nectar and throw away the peel. I demand
a party in my honor involving attractive female
strippers, my own ‘‘Talkback’’ question, songs
dedicated to me on the campus radio station, and
a year’s supply of free beer.

Now that I’ve gotten those bitter feelings out of
my system, it’s time for some sentimental reflec-
tion on my four years writing for the Phi. I sure
have learned a lot in that time. When I submitted
my first article in the second week of my fresh-
man year, I was immature, loved socially deviant
humor and had no knowledge of modern grammati-
cal laws. Now, in the last weeks of my senior
year, after hundreds of articles under the supervi-
sion of eight different editorial editors, my writing
is as infantile, socially unacceptable and unpolished
as ever. In fact, I think my writing is getting
worse. Maybe we should just skip the nostalgic
journey into the past. Instead I'll help out my re-
placement by sharing my definitive seven rules for
writing humor in the Phi.

Rule One: Drink lots of beer and write about large
canines. For some reasons, all humor writers do
these things. I really . know why. If you like
wine coolers and small dogs (under 30 pounds) or
cats then you should check into openings on the
W&Life page.

Rule Two: Keep in mind that humor writers are
sex symbols just like actors, musicians and profes-
sors. Attractive females frequently offer me their
bodies in return for autographed articles. It’s OK
to consort with your groupies, but don’t let it
interfere with your writing. And if you believe that
you should check into ‘‘Talkback’’ openings. The
truth is that writing humor for the Phi will proba-
bly make you unpopular with most members of the
opposite sex. Whenever a girl approaches me to
discuss my writing it usually means that she is
angry. Anyone who is really interested in you
because of your writing is probably a complete
weirdo and I advise you to stay as far away from
them as possible.

Rule Three: Try to intimidate the editorial editor
if it’s at all possible. In my years at the Phi, I
have been screwed by editors more times than I
can remember. J’ve been censored, buried on page

back. Maybe the University should do the same.
I am left wondering why we had a ‘‘comedian’’
from MTV appear in conjunction with Mock
Convention in the first place. With the money we
wasted on Shore we might have had another
political speaker to complement the visit of
Senator McGovern, which would have made
more sense as a Convention event anyway.

Soderberg
Apologizes

Dear Readers:

I would like to apologize to both the Lexing-
ton and Washington and Lee communities for my
inappropriate and ungentlemanly behavior on
October 17, 1990, when I fired a shotgun into
the ceiling of my fraternity house in an attempt

four, and held over to make room for ‘‘My Vi- ,
ews’’ about political trends in Bangladesh. I’ve had
entire columns of an article backwards and key
words misprinted. Usually, the editor’s decisions
are for the good of the paper and the errors
accidental, but it’s a good idea for you to hassle

them anyway. However, occasionally you'll run
into an editor who just plain hates your guts. Last
year, for example, the editorial editor basically
refused to run my columns until one or two weeks
after she received them. If it wasn’t unethical and
inappropriate I’d tell you that her name was Tina.
If it wasn’t so unfair I might also take a cheap
shot at her and tell you that her idea of a good
time was reading The Wall Street Journal. I finally
solved my problems with her by writing a column
in which I threatened to bludgeon her with a
sledgehammer. My favorite editor was Chris
Baradel whose idea of good humor was a descrip-
tion of a guy picking his nose at a stoplight.

 

 

Rule Four: Maintain an apathetic political posture.
Don’t vote and avoid reading any serious news.
Political agendas and humor do not mix.

Rule Five: Don’t waste your time trying to get ‘
women to send you photographs of themselves in
sexy lingerie. I’ve tried this hundreds of times and
it hasn’t worked yet. However, if any attractive
females out there are thinking about it, it’s not too
late to send me some photos (Jon Sbar, 800
McCorkle Dr., Lexington, VA 24450).

Rule Six: Read Ann Landers religiously. I get
most of my ideas from her column.

Rule Seven: Never write under your real name.
‘Jon Sbar’’ is just a pseudonym. My real name is
John D. Wilson and the rest is silence, which is
what Hamlet said after killing his uncle and driving
his girlfriend to suicide.

W&L history class blasts into past

 

By Kimberly Boots
Staff Reporter

 

A dozen W&L students are spending spring
term delving into W&L’s rich and lengthy
history by taking History 395B: The History of
Washington and Lee.

Professor Taylor Sanders initiated the course
last spring after students had repeatedly re-
quested to take such a course. Sanders, who
has taught at W&L for more than 20 years,
Said the main objective of the course is to ‘‘...
relae W&L to higher education in general”’
Over the course of its history and to encourage
the students to ‘‘think about the university in
ways maybe they hadn’t thought about before.’’
The course, only open to juniors and seniors,
focuses on the period between 1910 and 1945.

Each student must complete a research paper
on some aspect of Washington and Lee as a
Prerequisite for the class. Sanders said the paper
Tequirement keeps the size of the class small
and, because the students have already done

General Lee’s presidency, a history of violence
at W&L and histories of the journalism school,
the cross country team and the Beta Theta Pi
fraternity house. In addition to the initial
paper, students must also present oral reports,
write several essays and compile a 15-page
final research report.
The curriculum also includes lectures outside
regular class hours on various events in W&L
history. Most of these are conducted by W&L
faculty. Topics to be covered include W&L’s
1949 Bicentennial, the 1956 Mock Convention
and student life in the 1950s. The lectures are
open to the public.
This week’s class discussion centered on
W&L’s standing with regard to other relatively
old colleges. Sanders said W&L is a mixture of
the qualities of the ‘‘robber baron’’ colleges
such as Cormell, Johns Hopkins and Vanderbilt
and those of “colonial’’ colleges such as Wil-
liam and Mary, Harvard and Yale.

Sanders said that students interested in
taking the class should contact him early next
fall. Research work for the course should be

 

extensive research by the time the class begins,
they have specific areas of knowledge to con-

tribute to class discussions.

Paper topics included the Honor code,

McGovern
speech

About 400 people gathered on the
lawn fronting Lee Chapel as possible
1992 presidential candidate and
former senator George McGovern
kicked off the 20th W&L Mock
Convention with a speech Friday.

‘*We had an excellent turnout and
great media coverage,’ said Mock
Convention Committee Member Tal-
ley Woolley. ‘‘The media was very
interested in whether he was going to
announce his candidacy.’’

McGovern told the crowd he will
run if no other candidate emerges
who will stand for the liberal
achievements of the Democratic Par-
ly.

“I prefer a younger and less
battle scarred candidate who is com-
mitted to change,’* McGovern said.
“IT would not hesitate to yield to, a
better candidate.’’

A small potion of the crowd
applauded when McGovern called for
cuts in defense spending to be a vital
part of the Democratic platform.

‘It’s time Uncle Sam_ stopped
playing Uncle Sugar to Western
Europe and Japan and bring 400,000
troops home,’’ McGovern said.

McGovern told reporters after his
speech that the Democrats have a
chance of beating President George
Bush.

“‘T think it’s tough to take on an
incumbent president,’’ McGovern
said. ‘*I found that out in 1972. But
if the recession lingers, [Bush] will
be vulnerable.”’

McGovern also told reporters that
other possible Democratic candidates
are Virginia Governor Douglas
Wilder, Arkansas Governor Bill Clin-
ton, New York Governor Mario
Cuomo and Nebraska Senator Robert

to’ combine academic work and cotin-
seling, he said in January.

Manning received his bachelor’s
and master’s degrees from Wake
Forest University and later worked
there as administrative assistant to the
president.

Manning has served at Woodberry
Forest for the past eight years as an
English teacher, dormitory master,
basketball coach, admissions officer,
and director of the summer school,
Howison said in a letter to the W&L
community.

“He [Manning] was a jack-of-all-

son said.

Manning said he is exhilarated
about his new position.

“I’m very interested in the tran-
sition to college,’ Manning said.
“I’m fascinated by the freshman year
experience.”’

Manning said he is impressed by
the general character of W&L.

the honor system,’’ Manning said.

“T'think ‘it [W&L] is the most
attractive. schoolecertainly in the
South, and maybe in the nation,”’
Manning said.

Howison said he selected Manning
from a pool of about 120 applicants
from across the nation. Howison said
he primarily wanted someone who
could relate to freshmen and their
concerns.

Although Howison made the final
decision, he said he heard from ad-
ministrators, a search committee com-
posed of freshmen and faculty, and
many other students.

“We had a lot of people give
input into the process,’’ Howison
said.

Manning was  ‘‘recommended
highly’’ by several of his former
students at Woodberry Forest, H-
owison said.

Hal Waller, W&L ’93 and Wood-
berry Forest ’89, said he is ‘‘very ex-
cited’’ about Manning's appointment.

“Judging from the fine job he did

at Woodberry Forest, he should be a
huge asset to the W&L community,”’
Waller said.

Young, Director of Campus Safety
at Rollins College in Winter Park,
Florida, will replace Director of Uni-
versity Security Charles F. ‘‘Murph’’
Murray, who is retiring after 32 years
at W&L.

Young has more than 20 years of
experience in the field of campus
security and law _ enforcement,
Howison said. Young has served as
a military policeman, a security of-
ficer at the University of Iowa, and
chief of police in Tipton, Iowa.

At Rollins, which has an enroll-
ment of 1,500 students, Young over-
saw all safety and security concerns.
He developed informative programs
concerning fire safety, date rape,
orientation of new students, and al-
cohol and drug abuse for students
and staff.

In addition, Young serves as pres-
ident of the Florida Association of
Campus Safety and Security Ad-
ministrators, according to Howison.

Tennis wins
yet another
ODAC title

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

Washington and Lee has captured
the Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence men’s tennis title every year
since 1985, and the rest of the con-
ference has grown tired of looking up
at W&L.

Tired as they may be, however,
1991 offered no more rest for stiff
necks than previous years. W&L out-
pointed second place Hamdpen-Syd-
ney 69-52 in winning six of nine
flights to win the title again in 1991.

“Everybody gets up to beat us,”’
said senior Bill Meadows, who placed
second at No. 1 singles. ‘‘This is the
end of the season for everyone, and
it would make their season to beat
us. It makes things a little tougher
for us.””

W&L won three of the six singles
flights and swept the doubles in
winning the team title. Freshmen Rob
MacNaughton and Robert Wein and
sophomore Travis West captured their
singles flights at No. 2, No. 5 and
No. 6 respectively.

Meadows and MacNaughton
teamed to win the No. 1 doubles
flight, while Wein and West brought
home the No. 3 flight. Senior Reid
Manley and junior Richard Yates
captured the No. 2 flight.

For Meadows, the No. 4 player in
Division III, the loss in the singles
final marked his first loss in 40
ODAC regular season and tournament
matches. He called it a sobering loss.

W&L will now hope to go from
the role of favorite to underdog.
Ranked No. 12 in Division II], the
Generals must wait to see if they are
extended a bid to the NCAA Champi-
onships, held in California.

‘‘We’ve beaten one of the teams
ranked just below us already this
year,’ said Meadows. ‘‘That helps
us. Everyone is pretty confident we're
going to go.”’

The Generals finished the regular
season with a 5-13 record, but
Meadows thinks W&L can play with
teams ranked in the second five.

‘‘We have so much potential that

we haven't showed yet,’’ he said.
‘‘We’ve got more going for us than
our No. 12 ranking shows. We’re as
good as any team in the nation. It
just boils down to winning the big
points.”’

W&L won’t know if it is included
in the NCAA Tournament until Sun-
day,’ and the Generals will bide their
time practicing hard.

The team will be ready, Meadows
says, when the bid comes. The nature
of the NCAAs will guarantee that.

‘‘Nobody can be playing any
better than they are right now, espe-
cially the doubles,’’ he said. ‘‘And
the atmosphere at the NCAAs is so
intense that you can’t help but play
your best tennis.”’

W&L impatiently awaits bid

 

By Chris Simon
Staff Reporter

 

One might think an Old Dominion
Athletic Conference title and an
ODAC Coach of the Year honor
would satisfy the Washington and
Lee women’s tennis team, and one
might be wrong.

Despite finishing 30 points ahead
of the defending ODAC champions
and second place Sweet Briar, head
coach Cinda Rankin and her squad
won’t be satisfied without a bid to
the 1991 NCAA Division — Ill
women’s tennis national champion-
ships.

The Generals, one of four teams
ranked eleventh in this week’s Inter-
collegiate Tennis Coaches Association
(ITCA) poll, wait impatiently for an
invitation to the May 15 NCAA
Toumament to be played at Emory
University in Atlanta.

When a team loses a close game,
it often searches for excuses as to
why it lost. Very seldom does a team
admit there is nothing more it could
have done.

The Washington and Lee women’s
lacrosse team lost to Roanoke College
8-7 Saturday in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference Tournament
semi-finals, but the Generals make no

excuses for their performance in
Salem, Va.

“It was the best game I have ever
seen,’ said senior Shawn Wert.

‘There is no way we could have
played a better game.”’

‘It was the best game we have
ever played at Washington and Lee,”’
said senior Melinda Conkling. ‘‘They
gave us opportunities, and we capital-
ized. Everybody played as well as
they could have played. It was an
amazing game to watch.’

W&L scored first against the

accomplishment.”’

As if giving the NCAA tourna-
ment committee food for thought, the
Generals cruised to their second
ODAC championship in three years,
recording four singles victories and
two doubles titles en route to 66
team points and the title. Seniors
Kelly Martone and Leake, and fresh-
men Eugenia Foster and Kim
Dickinson combined for the singles
flights victories.

Foster and senior Jean Stroman
joined Martone and Leake for the
doubles titles.

“Going into the finals we had
placed all six individuals [singles],
and two out three in the doubles
finals,’’ said Rankin. ‘‘We were all
over the courts.”’

Stroman and Foster finished the
regular season ranked twelfth nation-
ally by ITCA as a doubles tandem.
In singles, Stroman is 21st in the
nation. Even if the NCAA doesn’t
offer W&L a position in team com-
petition, Stroman and Foster may

put scare

fifth-ranked Maroons, setting the tone
of the game, said Wert.

‘‘The game was close right from
the start,’’ she said. ‘‘We scored first
and that sent them a message. They
wanted to win big. They are a physi-
cal game, and we showed them that
they weren’t going to push us
around.”’

‘Everything was working for us,”’
said Conkling. ‘‘Kimberly Bishop was
back after an appendectomy and she
played beautifully. Ginny Dallum was
everywhere and Erica [Ingersoll]
made the key saves.”’

After W&L opened the scoring,
the teams traded goals until the final
15 minutes, in which Roanoke took
an 8-7 lead. W&L then had to chase
the ball while Roanoke ran out the
clock.

‘(Head coach] Jan [Hathorn] tells
us that at the end of a game, we
shouldn’t be able to run any more,”’
said Conkling. ‘‘That’s how it was
Saturday. We gave everything we
had.”’

W&L reached Saturday’s semifinal

head to Atlanta for the NCAA’s
individual tournament May 19.

ITCA ranked Sewanee, Washing-
ton College, and Trenton with W&L
at the eleventh position. Although the
Generals haven’t played Sewanee this
season, Rankin hopes the NCAA will
compare W&L’s and Sewanee’s per-
formances against similar opponents
before choosing the nation’s top
twelve.

Both W&L and Sewanee beat
Hope College earlier this year. The
Generals won 9-0, Sewanee 7-2.

The NCAA will make its deci-

by beating Sweet Briar for the second
time in three days Friday.

“It was a pretty easy win for
us,’’ said Wert. ‘‘We went in know-
ing we could win the game. After we
did, we were really psyched up to
play Roanoke.”’

Although W&L lost to Roanoke
early in the season, Wert said it was
a different W&L team the second
time around.

‘‘They beat us 8-3 early in the
season,’’ she said. ‘‘We weren’t as
prepared then. We were still trying to
put everyone in the right place on the
field. By Saturday, we were ready to
play.”’

‘*We played the number five team
in the nation to within one goal,’’
said Conkling. ‘‘We couldn’t have
played any better. It was a great way
to go out.”’

W&L finishes the season 10-6,
the most wins ever for the Generals.
Five of the losses came to teams
ranked in the nation’s top 15.

Golf defends
ODAC crown
vs. Macon

 

By John Laney
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee golf
team won its second straight Old
Dominion Athletic Conference title
this past weekend and head coach
Buck Leslie was named ODAC
Coach of the Year.

The Generals shot 302 in the
opening round of the ODAC Champi-
onships and then recorded a second-
day 308 to hold off second-place
finisher and tournament host Ran-
dolph-Macon for W&L’s third confer-
ence title in the last four years.

‘‘We thought we could win, but
we didn’t underestimate the other
teams,’’ Leslie said. ‘‘We played
good golf and consistent golf. The
round of 302 was a peak perform-
ance.’’

Junior Clay Thomas shot a pair of :
73s to lead W&L and finish as the:
second-place medalist, while class-
mate Jay McKnight carded a 152.+

Both Thomas and McKnight were : '

named All-ODAC for the second yenn
in a row.

“Clay and Jay anchored us, bins’
{junior] Brad Thoburn shot a 75 and *
an 80 which helped and [senior]:

Brian Kopet played steady with a Bs ‘

and a 79,’’ Leslie said.

The Coach of the Year award was °
the sixth for Leslie, who became,’
W&L’s golf coach in 1975. In De-
cember, 1989, Leslie was diagnosed
as having leukemia and was in and
out of the hospital for the next four
months. He stayed in contact with his
players by phone, and when he could,
he would go to matches and watch
them warm up.

‘‘Winning the award was very
rewarding to say the least,’’ Leslie
said. ‘‘I feel lucky, very humble and
thankful to have been out there. It’s
certainly an emotional high for me.’’

W&L (29-2) now must wait until
May 14 to learn if it receives a bid
to the Division III national champion-
ships, which will be held in Lincoln,
Nebraska, on May 21-24. The Gener-
als finished seventh out of 20 teams
at last year’s championships in Jekyll
Island, Georgia.

Sometimes it’s best not to wake a
Sleeping giant.

Hampden-Sydney found that out
last Saturday. The Tigers scored the
first three goals of the game before
the Washington and Lee men’s
lacrosse team exploded for seven
Straight goals en route to a 13-5 win.

The win gave the Generals their
first ever Old Dominion Athletic
Conference Championship, and more
importantly, kept W&L’s hopes for
an NCAA Toumament bid alive. The
tournament field is announced
Sunday.

Drew Anton keyed the W&L

explosion. Roberts scored a career-
high six goals and Anton added four
as the Generals improved to 10-3 on
the season. Each added an assist.

‘It was an important game for us
because we had to win to keep our
play-off hopes alive,’’ said senior
attacker Mike Moseman. ‘‘It was also
for the outright ODAC Championship,
and we had never won that before.’’

Senior defenseman David Farace
said it took a while for the Generals
to get settled down.

“I was a little worried because
they jumped out to a 3-0 lead,’’ he
said. ‘‘We weren’t playing real hard
in the first quarter. Then we settled
down.”’

W&L scored once at the end of
the first quarter and then outscored
the Tigers 7-0 in the second quarter

Roberts, offensive explosion
produce first-ever ODAC title

to take firm control of the game.

While Roberts and Anton did the
scoring damage, much of the credit to
the offensive success belongs to the
midfielders, seniors Clark Wight and
Todd Garliss and sophomore John
Hunter.

“Our middies did a great job
beating their men,’’ said Farace.
“Once our middie beat his man, the
defenseman slid, and we hit the open
man. Jeff and Drew finished things
off better than they have all season.’’

Hunter was the main distributor.
He handed out four assists while
scoring a goal of his own.

‘Their defensive middies had a
hard time controlling us,’’ he said.
“We just went by our men and
dished the ball. Roberts and Anton
scored the goals.’’

 

It was not all offense for the
Generals. The defense was again
superb, allowing just two goals over
the final 45 minutes. Senior goalie
Tom Costello made 11 saves on the
afternoon.

‘The defense played well,’ said
Farace. ‘‘We weren't real aggressive
in the first quarter, but we settled
down. Cos came up big again, just
like he has all season.’’

The 13-5 win sets up another
must-win game for the fifth-ranked
Generals in Saturday’s Lee-Jackson
Classic against VMI. ‘‘We can’t
afford to lose,’’ Farace said simply.
‘‘We’re looking at this as the most
important game of the season. If we
lose — there goes the playoffs. If we
win, we have a great chance to get to
the playoffs.”

The Ring-tum Phi, May 2, 1991

 

History repeats, history repeats

 

By Marcy Brown
Entertainment Editor

 

James A. Garfield once said ‘‘History is con-
stantly repeating itself, making only such changes
of programme as the growth of nations and cen-
turies requires.”’

The following articles appeared in The Ring-
tum Phi five, ten and 25 years ago. Although some
of the details have changed, the events and the
debates they generated may resemble closely cer-
tain world and campus issues the W&L com-
munity has encountered recently. See what you
think...

ALIVE AND KICKING, OR JUST KICKING
OUT?
By Marie Kothman, Assistant Editorial Page Editor

If the number of people leaving school because
of honor violations is any measure of the useful-
ness and health of the Honor System, the system
is indeed alive and kicking. But the disturbing

fact is that these dismissals have resulted from
illegal activities that warrant heavy fines and prison

terms in a court of law. Each week The Phi
headlines stories about credit card fraud, check
forgery, alleged rape, vandalized frat houses, and
students shooting other students. Alumni, be-
wildered by what they read, write letters begging
students to ‘‘please be gentle with our Universi-
ty.’’ What's going on here? It seems the W&L
student body is the sole cause of the crime rate in
Lexington.

The attitude of the majority of students seems
to be not ‘‘Let’s try to do what’s honorable,’’ but
‘‘Let’s see how much we can get away with.”’
With such an attitude, the Honor System becomes
a farce.

U.S IN LAND WAR, AGRONSKY SAYS HERE
By Ralph Fuller

What was once only American support of a
government in South Vietnam has become an
American land war in Asia, a CBS news corre-
spondents said here today, and he added that ‘‘for
the United States what is truly at issue in the
world crisis is how we will use our power.”’

Delivering the final address of the SIPA con-
vention in Lee Chapel, newsman Martin Agronsky
said the U.S. has become involved in a land war
it cannot win and cannot afford to lose.

But the problems of Vietnam relate and project
beyond the immediate situation, he added. He
cited the United States position as the most power-
ful nation in the world, and its ‘‘awesome respon-
sibility...the power to destroy absolutely.”’

Agronsky noted the view of Sen. William
Fulbright that the United States is in danger of
succumbing to the arrogance of power, and, he
added it is easy to be impatient with those who
question our policies.

The make-believe quality of the
upbeat
catchy lyrics, and witty lines provide
a medium through which Sondheim
speaks to the audience in the lan-
guage of the heart. As the musical
begins, the giant storybooks of Cin-
derella, Jack and the Beanstalk, and
The Baker and His Wife literally
open to draw the audience into the
action. As all of the characters sug-
gest, life has been unfair to them and
there is something they wish to
change. The plaintive "I wish" rings
out and draws us to the central motif.

is afraid, she must go to take bread
and sweets to her grandmother. Gina
Valentine, as Little Red Riding Hood,
provides a delightful portrayal of
childhood innocence, curiosity and
fear.

The Witch appears, and explains
the curse of infertility which she has
placed on the Baker and his Wife.
She has also locked up the Baker’s
sister, Rapunzel, in a tower in the
woods. All, she claims, in vengeance
for the Baker’s father’s wrongdoing.
To remove the curse, the Baker and
his Wife must obtain Jack’s cow, Red
Riding Hood’s cape, Rapunzel’s hair,
and Cinderella's shoe. Every charac-
ter’s desire leads them into the woods
and on a journey through terror, evil,
and the choices that come with the
maturation process.

As the Baker and his Wife set out
to fulfill their goals, they become lost
in the web of right vs. wrong and
necessity vs. desire. As the Baker’s
Wife takes advantage of the rather
dense young Jack, trading her pur-
portedly magical beans for his milky
white cow, she declares "If the end is
right, it justifies the beans!" A touch-
ing scene reveals a heart within the
seemingly evil Witch, brilliantly por-
trayed by Kelly Ellenwood, as she
explains her attempts to protect
Rapunzel from the evils of the world.
She wishes Rapunzel to remain a
child, a selfish wish despite its good
intentions. The first act ends with a
rendition of "Ever After" portraying
all the fairytales with happy endings
while hinting of the uneasiness of the
moral integrity sacrificed in the pro-
cess.

As the second act commences, the
characters still long for more, al-

Play draws viewers Into the Woods:

though they claim to be happy. The
characte: retum to the woods, this
time in pursuit of a giant ravaging
their town. As the characters have
selfishly pursued their own desires,

they have become liars and thieves, ‘
and their actions end in death and de-- ,

struction. Just as the Baker’s Wife
realizes that she must reach a higher
level of maturity and leave the
woods, she is crushed by the giant.
The overriding themes of maturation

as an ongoing process and of the |

importance of parenting by exam-
ple rather than a dictatorship lead into
the last refrains. The lyrics ring out:
"You have to go....
leam and less to know," and “Be
careful what you say... children will
listen." We must all go into the
woods, but we must also remember
that "no one is alone," and we must
consider the effects of our actions
and our words.
