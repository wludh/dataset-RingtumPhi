Smithereens will
play W&L Friday

 

From News Releases

 

Despite rumors that the pro-
gressive. rock band The
Smithereens would cancel its
performance at the Pavilion Friday
night, the band will play to W&L
crowd with doors opening at 8
p-m. and music beginning by 9
p-m.

According to Student
Activities Board Chairwoman
Katie Duwell, the band’s lead
singer, Pat DiNizio underwent an
emergency appendectomy last
Tuesday, which led the band to
cancel several concerts, including
performances at James Madison
University, and the University of
Virginia.

Duwell confirmed that the band
will definitely come and its mem-
bers were resting up before the
performance, ‘‘so they’ll have a
lot of energy for the concert.’’

The band’s most recent album,
Smithereens 11, has climbed the
charts by continuing the group’s
tradition of rock and pop which
the New Trouser Press calls ‘‘-
impossibly winsome memorable
and rapturous without sacrificing
any rock ’n’ roll energy or guts.”’
The album includes everything
from the group’s hard-rocking
first single, ‘‘A Girl Like You,”
to the ballad ‘‘Kiss Your Tears
Away,” to the fuzzed-out ‘*Blues
Before and After.’’

‘‘We wanted to try to get a
more in-your-face guitar sound,
and we wanted everything crisper

sounding, louder and more
present,’ said bassist Mike
Mesaros. ‘‘We’ve always been
fairly heavy and raunchy live, and
we wanted to capture a little more
of that on record.”’

The Smithereens were bom
many years ago in Carteret, New
Jersey, where Mesaros, guitarist
Jim Babjak and drummer Dennis
Diken were elementary school
friends. Pat DiNizio, from nearby
Scotch Plains, New Jersey, met
the other three through a clas-
sified ad in a local music paper.

‘Dennis, Jim and I were more
like Kinks freaks,’’ said Mesaros.
“Pat was more like Black Sab-
bath. But we had a lot in com-
mon: the Who, Beatles, Buddy
Holly. The same roots, but with
branches going in different direc-
tions -- which makes for a strong
combination.”

The Smithereens were signed
to Enigma Records in October,
1985, one week after mailing. out
demo cassettes with only their
name and phone number included.
Their album, Especially for You,
made Billboard’s year-end Top
100 list and yielded several radio
favorites.

With their timeless, efferves-
cent pop and radio-friend sound
of six strings crunching, The
Smithereens offer a delightful
recipe no true dedicated follower
of rock could possibly turn down.

Tickets for The Smithereens
concert will be on sale tomorrow
for $7, and $10 at the door.

Special weekend planned

 

By Melinda Conkling
and Pamela Kelley

 

In addition to the traditional
football game, Washington and
Lee University has scheduled a
variety of activities for Homecom-
ing weekend, including alumni
receptions, concerts, lectures, an
alumni career symposium, a panel
discussion on global economics,
and athletic contests.

According to Assistant Alumni
Relations Director Rob Mish the
university’s aim this year was to
provide Homecoming activities
that would appeal to both alumni
and students. Mish said he re-
gards Homecoming as a fall
W&L reunion for all alumni.

‘‘The things that make Wash-

ington and Lee special for those
who have been out 60 years are
very similar to the things that
make it special to those who have
been out only six years,’’ he said.

Two reunion groups will offi-
cially gather on campus _ this
weekend. The Five Star Generals,
alumni who graduated from W&L
50 or more years ago, will be
honored at a dinner in Evans
Dining Hall Friday evening.
About 65 Five-Star Generals are
expected to return.

Members of the four most
recently graduated classes will
gather for a Cluster Reunion, a
program that was initiated two
years ago to give the younger
alumni an opportunity to gather
on campus prior to their five-
year spring reunions.

Friday’s activities will begin at
12 noon with a memorial service
in Lee Chapel honoring the 120th
anniversary of General Lee’s
death. At 12:10 p.m. Thomas
Morgan Oppenheim, Law Profes-
sor at the George Washington
University, will deliver the an-
nual John Randolph Tucker Lec-
ture in the Moot Courtroom of
Lewis Hall. His topic will be ‘In
Defense of Legal Education.”’

A panel discussion will be
held in duPont Hall at 2 p.m. on
“The New Global Economies:
How will America Compete?.’’
Panel members include W&L
Politics Professor Craig Mc
Caughrin, Economics Professor
Bruce Herrick. who will comment

Ceremony to honor Lee

 

By Pamela Kelley
Supplement Editor

 

A memorial service honoring
General Robert E. Lee will be
held at noon Friday, October 12
in Lee Chapel. The ceremony will
mark the death of Gen. Lee, who
served as president of, then,
Washington College from 1865 to
1870.

Beginning at 9:30 a.m., the
time of Lee’s death in 1870, the
bells in the Chapel will toll 19
times, the equivalent of a 19-gun
salute. At noon, the Liberty Hall
Volunteers, a group of W&L
students and employees interested
in Civil War re-enactment will
march from Washington Hall on
the W&L campus to Lee Chapel
for the memorial service.

The featured speaker at the
memorial service will be George
E. Goodwin °39, a 1948 Pulitzer
Prize winner and senior consultant
for Manning, Selvage, and Lee,
Inc.,of Atlanta. The topic of
Goodwin's speech will be ‘‘The
Legacies of Robert E. Lee.”’

Goodwin says rather than
focus on Lee’s death or life, he
plans to focus on the ideals and
traditions Lee instilled in the
Army of Northern Virginia, the
Confederate States of America,
and W&L.

Robert Peniston, director of

Lee Chapel and Joan Brooks,
vice-president of the Virginia
Chapter of the United Daughters
of the Confederacy, will also
speak

The service will also include
readings from The Blue and the
Gray and Douglas Southall
Freem:an’s RE. Lee and will
conclude with Gen. Lee’s favorite
hymn ‘‘How Firm a Foundation’’
and ‘‘Shenandoah’’ performed by
W&L singing groups JubiLee and
Soutii:rn Comfort.

W&L Assistant Director of
Alumni Relations Rob Mish said
the university hopes the service
will add impetus to the
Homecoming weekend for return-
ing alumni. Mish said this year’s
memorial service is doubly special
because it marks the first time the
anniversary of Lee’s death and
Homecoming weckend have coin-

The service is sponsored by

Shillington to miss Homecoming

 

By Alisann McGloin
Staff Reporter

 

This Saturday a 27 year-old
homecoming tradition will be put
on hold awaiting the recovery of
chemistry professor Keith Shil-
lington.

Shillington who has _ been
crowning the homecoming queens
since the events inception, will be
unable to participate in this Satur-
day’s events. Shillington suffered
from a stroke last January and
has been at home recovering since
the start of this school-year.

“EVoTyoné 18 sorry
(Shillington) won’t be able to be
with us," assistant director of
Alumni Relations, Rob Mish, said.
Mish emphasized though that they
were not in fact looking for a
replacement for Shillington but
mercly a substitute until he is
able to return.

Shillington, who said a few
weeks ago that he just wanted to
be well to partake in homecoming
activities was very emotional on
the subject of this year’s events.
He said that he was very sorry he
would not be able to partake us
usual this year.

According to Mish, this year’s
queen will be crowned by Tom
Hatcher, President of the Execu-
tive Committee of the student
body.

Mish said, "We have decided
to put it back into the hands of
the students. It seemed a very
logical way to follow it." And
Hatcher has agreed to take the
place of Shillington, at least for
this year.

Not only has Shillington been

Friday, October 12

1] a.m. - 5 p.m.

 

 

Prof. Shillington
first announces...

crowning homecoming queens
since before most W&L students
were born, but he can also make
the legitimate claim to be the first
ever to assume the role. When
asked about his role in the ac-
tivities last year, Shillington said,
"As far as I know, I started at the
beginning. When they started
having a homecoming queen, they

asked me that year to crown her."

Since Shillington was the first
professor to crown the queen, he
did not have any guidelines or
traditions to follow. He was
forced. to literally invent the uni-
que halftime event.Shillington felt
that it was his acting abilities that
made him the man for the part.

"One of the reasons why I
was asked [to create the event]
was because I was in the theatre.
I had played Malvolio in ’Twelfth
Night," Shillington said.

And what did Shillington
create? Shillington set the stage
for his famous (or infamous)
homecoming kiss which accom-
panies the crowning of the queen.

Stacy Patmore, the 1988-89
homecoming queen, with regard
to her reaction to the Shillington
kiss said, "I was a little nervous
about it, but the kiss wasn’t that
bad."

Last year Shillington, himself,
said on the subject of the
homecoming kiss, that "what I do
the kids adore." He added
modestly, students also “adore
coca-cola." Yet the traditional
kiss always seems to bring the
biggest roar from the stands.

One could always tell by the

" crowd’s reaction that Shillington

had arrived. He is recognizable
by the golf cart by which he
zooms onto Wilson field and the
unusual tie that he will without
fail be sporting. Shillington
explained the ties last year as as
simply part of the “clown role” he
said he played in the homecoming
tradition.

When asked about the changes
in homecoming traditions over the
years, Shillington agreed that

homecoming is another facet of
our campus that has maintained
its timelessness.

Of course there have been a
few changes in the traditional
homecoming ceremonies with the
Washington & Lee women who
now also compete for the crown.
Shillingotn was present at the
historic occasion when Catherine
Christian was the first Washington
& Lee student crowned queen.
Another addition to the traditional
homecoming representatives came
last year when Washington &
Lee’s three sororities nominated
their own representatives for the
competition.

Last year Professor Shillington,
who is scheduled to retire at hte
end of this academic year, spoke
wistfully of a future beyond
retirement. He did not know
what his role in future homecom-

 

..and then kisses
the Homecoming Queen

ings would be. According to the
Alumni Relations office, his spot
is still open, ready for his return
regardless of his retirement status.

Committee set
to name Queen

 

From staff reports

 

The woman who is crowned
Homecoming Queen will first
have to survive the interview
process, which will be held Fri-
day.

The panel which chooses the
Queen, made up this year of
Chairman Scott Dittman, Yvonne
Atkins, Prof. Phillip Cline and
Claire Sanders, will ask each of
the 23 candidates questions that
they themselves choose, according
to the Alumni Office.

W&L 1990 Homecoming Schedule

The questions typically involve
subjects such as each candidate’s
major, interests, and school and
community service activities, said
the Alumni Office. However, each
year the committee is free to ask
whatever question it feels are
necessary.

Last year’s chairman, Prof.
Clark Mollenhoff, said the com-
mittee does not have bias towards
representatives from W&L.

“We're open to any young
lady who impresses us,’’ he said.
‘All we do is pick the best from
what we have to work with.’’

Traditions of W&L Homecomings

 

By R.J.Thomas
W&L Class of 90

1925. The first Homecoming.
On Saturday, November 7th,
1925, thousands of people filled
Wilson Field, bleachers erected on
both sides and both ends of the
field, and all standing space to
watch the Generals under a steady
drizzling rain beat UVa 12-0.
Although the Homecoming crowd
no longer fills the stands and
traditions changed, W&L still
holds the spirit of that first
homecoming.

The Alumni Magazine for
October 1925 announced the
‘First Official Annual Homecom-
ing Day.’’ Tickets were $2 and
the seats were reserved. Alumni
were invited to attend a meeting
of the Alumni Association, Inc.
where they would be addressed
by GH. Denny, a former W&L
president who had gone on to
become president of the Univer-
sity of Alabama (which was
sharply criticized elsewhere in the
same issue of the magazine for
stealing the W&L Swing and
calling it the Alabama Swing).
Alumni were also invited to
attend classes that morning. ‘‘That
morning’? was Saturday. Things
have changed.

Accommodations were made
for 10,000 people. Fraternity
house managers’ names were
listed in the Alumni Magazine so
alumni could contact them if they
wanted to stay in their fraternity

houses. The railroads offered spe-
cial rates from all over the state
to Lexington. Game tickets were
on sale in Roanoke, Lynchburg
and Staunton.

The night before the game a
pep rally was held and a thousand
people attended. There were
cheers, speeches and a bonfire.

Local merchants were asked to
keep their stores closed during the
afternoon so that everyone in
town could attend the game. It
must have seemed like everyone
in the state was there to watch
the General beat UVa. A dance
was held on Saturday night. The
First Official Annual Homecoming
Day was such a success that they
decided to keep doing it.

Many of the traditions which
grew up over the years are now
gone: fraternity decorations, fresh-
man parades, the 13 Club, pep
rallies, the ‘‘Opening Dance.”’

For years at Homecoming the
Alumni Association would award
a prize to the fraternity with the
best decorations. Fraternities
would decorate their front lawns-
-those that had front lawns-- cther
would cece ate their houses. They

would make banners and floats to
carry and ride during the Fresh-
man Torchlight Parade.

On Friday night, the night
before the big game, the fresh-
men, wearing pajamas, and other
students would gather in the gym
for a pep rally. W&L’s cheer-
leaders would lead the students in
cheers and speeches would be
given by the coaches and players.
In 1955, RJ. Reynolds Tobacco
Company gave 1,000 megaphones
to the students for the pep rally.

The freshmen would then,
pajama clad, carry torches through
town. The most frequent path was
down Washington Street, left on
Jefferson, right through Red

Square, and then up Main Street
to Nelson. The students would
then take a right on Nelson and
break in to the State Theater for

a free movie.

The parade must have been a
sight. At a time when the world
was not so serious, when stu-
dents weren’t spending their col-
lege careers building resumes. In
1955 the Phi ran a picture of the
parade. In the picture was group
of students wearing pajamas, one

 

of them bearing a placard reading,
“‘Shove It Up a Turkey--Gobble,
Gobble.”’

13 days before Homecoming,
the 13 Club would begin its in-
itiation period for 13 new pledges
from 13 different fraternities who
each had paid an initiation fee of
$13.13. At some point during
these 13 days the statue of Cyrus
McCormick, the one standing
guard on front campus, the one
most visitors think is Lee, was
tarred and feathered, and the base
covered with number 13s.

What a fine time it must have
been.

Saturday of Homecoming
would usually begin with a foot-
ball game, just as it does now,
but without the liquid pleasure
some of recent years. In the 1955
Homecoming issue of the Phi the
EC stated that its policy against
drinking in public would be strict-
ly enforced at that year’s game.

On Saturday night a dance,
called ‘‘Openings’’ would be held
in a lavishly decorated Doremus
Gymnasium. At the dance, the
Homecoming queen would be
crowned. The queen. We still
have that, and until last year, Dr.
Shillington still kissed them. How
long has he been doing that? It
seems as if it started back in the
early 60s, but he’s not sure and
no one else is cither.

But for all those rich tradi-
tions only two remain, the game
and the queen. Where did it all

Five-Star Generals reflect on Lee’s college

 

By Kim Boots
Staff Reporter

 

Sixty-five Five-Star Generals
will return to Lexington this
weekend to visit the place where
they spent their college years
more than half a century ago.

Five-Star Generals are
Washington and Lee alumni who
graduated 50 or more years ago,
who may reunite each year during
Homecoming weekend. Each year
these special alumni are honored
through several activities, includ-
ing a banquet and recognition
during half-time of the Homecom-
ing football game.

According to Assistant Alumni
Relations Director Rob Mish,
there are about 1600 living Five-
Star Generals or alumni who
graduated from W&L 50 years or
more ago. Mish says Five-Star
Generals offer unique viewpoints
on university life and concems
because they have dealt with
social and political issues which
are radically different from those
W&L students face today.
However many vestiges of the
university, as it existed in the first
quarter of this century, like the
Honor Code and the Collonade,
have endured.

Dr. Craig Houston: Patterson,

who lives in Harrisonburg, Vir-
ginia, graduated in 1919, before
WA&L even had Homecoming, and
is one of the oldest returning
alumni. The university awarded
with an honorary Doctorate of
Divinity degree in 1936.

Like so many students who
have multiple familial ties to the
university, Patterson is a third-
generation W&L man and his
son, Robert G. Patterson,
graduated from Washington and

T4eé in 1950 Pattercan has

attended many W&L_ reunions
since he was graduated, including
some that were not his own, like
the 50-year reunion of the first
class to graduate under Robert E.
Lee’s Presidency in 1916.

While Patterson was a W&L
student between 1915 and 1919,
Washington and Lee students
faced the grim prospect of being
drafted for an overseas war. He
recalled some of the college’s
extracurricular activities.

After World War 1 began,
‘‘Washington and Lee students
decided to learn something about
drilling and shooting’’ he said, so
students organized three
companies and VMI officers came
over for two or three sessions a
weck to instruct them in march-
ing, drilling and saluting.

‘‘We had the draft, and most
of us didn’t have any good ex-
cuse and I realized that my num-
ber was coming up and so I
volunteered and joined the Marine
Corps,’’ said Patterson. In the
spring of 1918, while a junior, he
left for China where he flew B-
wing fighters in World War I.
Patterson returned six months
later and graduated from
Washington and Lee on schedule
in the spring of 1919. The

WE&L Swing

Come cheer for Washington and Lee,

We’re going to win another victory;

The White and Blue we will ever wave in triumph,
For the University. RAH! RAH! RAH!

Fight to the finish we are with you,

Break thru the line on every play;

Rush the ball on down the field and we will win
this game today.

When Washington and Lee’s men fall in line,
We’re going to win again anther time;

For W&L I yell, yell, yell

And for the University; I yell like hell

And we will fight! fight! fight! for every yard;
Circle the ends and hit that line right hard!
And we will roll those Wahoos on the sod!

Yes by God! RAH! RAH! RAH!

College Friendships

Our college friendships must sever and fade as
does the dying day.

Our closest bonds must all be broken as through
this world we wend our way.

But yet whatever be life’s fortune, though friends
be few..

We’ll love thee still,

Cluster Reunion
unites classes

 

By Craig Burke
Staff Reporter

 

In addition to the Five-Star
Generals’ Reunion, which has
been the focus of the Alumni
Office during previous Homecom-
ing weekends, the Cluster
Reunion Program for graduates
from the past four years will also
be emphasized this year, accord-
ing to W&L Alumni Staff As-
sociate Joel Smith.

The Cluster Reunion Program
has been incorporated in hopes of
building a strong alumni network
for recent graduates. Before the
Cluster Reunion Program was
established the first formal
reunion for graduates was five
years after Commencement, al-
though the Five-Star Generals’
Reunion has honored alumni who
graduated fifty years previously or
more.

Nancy Hickam, a 1990
graduate, said the Cluster program
is a great idea that provides in-
centive to recent graduates who
already wish to visit the campus.
‘Homecoming is an occasion
when many younger grads would
like to come back to W&L.
They are more apt to visit than
are the older alumni who visit

during Alumni Weekend
May,”’ said Hickam.

The Alumni Office relied on
graduates who had been members
of Kathekon, a W&L  student-
alumni relations organization, in
preparing this year’s cluster
reunion. ‘‘The members of
Kathekon who we contacted were
extremcly valuable in helping us
put together the cluster reunion.
In fact, the tour of the fraternities
we are offering this year grew out
of a graduate’s suggestion,’’ said
Smith.

The Alumni Office hopes that
the work put into the cluster
reunion program will help bridge
the gap between older and
younger alumni. ‘‘I think the
Cluster Reunion will work well,”’
commented 1990 graduate Wesley
Goings. ‘‘People are going to
come if they possibly can.’’

Smith, who graduated from
WA&L last year, says ties with his
classmates have become more
important to him as he has gotten
older and he hopes recent
graduates will recognize the in-
creasing importance of class unity
and attend the Cluster Reunions.‘

Although reunions are tradi-
tionally held in the spring, Smith
said ‘‘this is a big time for the
alumni.”’

on the basic economies of various
countries. Richard K. Stuart, a
1937 W&L graduate who spent
time as a foreign service member
in the Pacific, will also speak.

The Alumni Career Assistance
Program has coordinated a panel
discussion on ‘‘The Transition
into the World of Work,’’ a con-
versation between recent graduates
and current students.

At 6:30 p.m. Friday a recep-
tion for all alumni, honoring the

‘1990 W&L Homecoming court,

will be held at the W&L Alumni
House, followed by a dinner

_ honoring the Five Star Generals.

At 9 p.m. Friday night The
Smithereens, a New Jersey pro-
gressive rock band, will perform
the annual Homecoming concert,
sponsored by the Student Activi-
ties Board, at the Student Activi-
ties Pavilion.

Saturday morning’s schedule
includes a coffee break at 9:30
a.m. at Lee Chapel for all alumni.
The first concert of the year by
the university choral ensembles,
including the all-female JubiLee
and all-male Southern Comfort, is
scheduled to follow at 10:30 a.m.
in Lee Chapel.

At 11 am. alumni will meet

Program and the Lenfest Center

university granted him three credit
hours for service. Among others,
Winson Barker of Wise, Virginia
and Dr. Winter Royston of Lexi-
ngton will be present. Barker,
who was graduated from W&L in
1927, retired from teaching in
1968. Royston, who was gradu-
ated in 1928, is a W&L Professor
Emiritus of Mathematics.

The three alumni consider the
admission of women into W&L in

1984 as one of the most monu- .

mental changes in its traditions
since their graduation. However
they seemed to agree that co-
education has been a success at
W&L “I think it’s a grand
thing,’’ said Barker.

Patierson pointed out an ad-
vantage to the presence of women
on campus: ‘‘At two o’clock on
Friday afternoon when the dismis-
sal bell rang for classes, practical-
ly a third of the student body
would take off to Hollins and the
other girls’ schools. Just think
how much gas it’s saved having
the women there.’ However,
unlike today, not many students
had cars in 1919.

W&L has also undergone
physical changes. In the 1920's,
students visited their deans and
the W&L president in Newcomb
Hall, which houses classrooms
today. The area which is now
home to the Law School used to
be ‘‘just an abandoned gully,’’
according to Patterson. Barker

does not oppose the newer, more
modern buildings such as the
library, which may seem a con-
trast to the predominantly neo-
classic architecture of most of the
campus. He says the school has
‘been improving with the new
buildings and the new studies’’
and is still ‘‘improving and is one
of the finest schools in the

country.”’

All three alumni, who also
returned to W&L last year for
Homecoming, think certain aspects
of the school have remained solid
through the years, such as the
Speaking Tradition or the Honor
System, the presence and legacy
of former W&L President General
Robert E, Lee, and Lee Chapel.

the Cluster Reunion Program.

A 12. noon Oktoberfest
luncheon is scheduled for stu-
dents, faculty and alumni on the
upper athletic field, where the Jim
Caldwell Band will provide jazz,
swing, Dixieland, and old-time
tunes.

The band is comprised of
about 20 members from Lynch-
burg to Roanoke to Lexington and
has been playing at area functions
for over 20 years. According to
band leader Jim Caldwell, ‘‘we
don’t fool with that rock-and-roll
stuff.”’

2 p.m. is kick-off time for the
Homecoming game, in which the
Generals will take on long-time
rival, the Hampden-Sydney Tigers,
on Wilson Field. The 1990 Wash-
ington and Lee Homecoming
Queen will be announced during

the men’s soccer team will op-

Mish said, although all ac-
tivities are significant, there are a
few that shouldn’t be missed, like
the Lee Memorial Service, the
Oktoberfest Luncheon, the ACAP
lecture, which all are planned for
students and alumni. ‘‘The best
events tend to be the ones that

go? Did they just quit? Was some
ban placed on 13s or pajamas?
No. Perhaps they were killed by
a war. They mostly died out in
the late 60s, when thoughts of
Vietnam were running through the
heads of every young man.

The last mention in the Phi of
a house winning a decorations
award was Lambda Chi in 1969,
and a writer in that same issue
wrote, ‘‘It seems that for the most
part, an alumnus returning to
campus is a lonely experience.”’

By 1970, the only mention
made in the Phi of Homecoming
was that it existed and there
would be a concert Friday night
and the game Saturday followed
by a grain party in Red Square.
One of the classes listed for a
reunion in 1970 was the Class of
1925. In 1971 Homecoming was
nothing but a small picture in the
Phi after the fact, in the lower
left hand corner of the front page,
of Shillington kissing the Queen.

But W&L was never a big
school. The teeming thousands
that once filled Wilson Field are
back to a scale more in line with
a small college at the base of the
Blue Ridge. Mountains. But. there

are some things here that will
never change.

On that first Homecoming
Day, back in 1925, former W&L
President G.H.Denny _ praised
W&L with words that still hold
true. ‘‘Take away from many a
college its endowment and what
is left?’’ asked Denny, ‘‘But strip
the Washington and Lee Campus
of every building and every dol-
lar, and there are left some things
more precious than silver and
gold.’’ That hasn’t changed.

The following poem from the
1925 alumni magazine, the first
annual year of Homecoming, is as
effective now as it was more than
half a century ago:

By the banks of old North
River, winding lazy round the hill,

To the Dear old college cam-
pus, my thoughts are turning still,

For the college bells are call-
ing, and I know they say to me,

Come you back, you old
alumnus, back to Washington and
Lee.

Generals hope for Homecoming win over Tigers

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

It’s that Homecoming time of
year again, and everyone is mak-
ing plans, trying to arrange the
weekend to incorporate the most
sun into a three-day time span.

The Student Activities Board
has already planned your Friday
for you. The Smithereens will
kick off the weekend Friday night
in the Pavilion.

But what are you doing after
the concert? M:ght I suggest a
relaxing afternon courtesy of the
Washington and Lee Athletic De-
p«rtment?

While you are recovering from
Friday night’s festivities, why not
spend a day in the sun (knock on
wood) enjoying W&L athletics?

Start by visiting Liberty Hall
Field to take a look at last year’s
and this year’s best in Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference soc-
cer. The women’s soccer team
kicks off action at 11:30 am.
with a conference game against
Randolph-Macon Woman's Col-
lege. The Generals are off to one
of their best starts ever and will
look to continue to roll against R
-MWC.

The team is led by a pair of
freshman. Karen Stutzmann leads
the team in scoring with seven
goals on the season, including the
school’s first ever three-goal per-
formance. She got her hat trick in
a 3-2 win over Wheeling last
week.

Kate Stimeling has been stingy
in goal all season for the Gener-
als. She allows just 1.11 goals per
contest and has 62 saves on the
season.

At 1:30 p.m., also on Liberty
Hall Field, the defending ODAC
Champion men’s soccer team
plays host to Virginia Wesleyan
in a game that has conference
title ramifications riding in the
balance. The game is sure to be
tight. Last year, the Generals beat
VWC 1-0 on Liberty Hall Field
to capture the ODAC Tournament
when Patrick Brown assisted Scott
Levitt late in the second half.

The Generals struggled to start
1990 but are still unbeaten in
conference play and have not lost
in 10 games at home, going 9-0-
1. Sophomore Reid Murphy lead
the team with six goals. Freshman
Dan Rhodes has four goals and
sophomore Mike Mitchem has
two goals and four assists.

After you’ve had your fill of
soccer, head over to Wilson Field
for the gridiron tilt between the
Generals and arch-rival Hampden-
Sydney at 2 p.m. The Generals
have struggled offensively but
boast one of the top defenses in
the ODAC.

W&L is 18-15-2 in Homecom-
ing games since 1955 and 6-6
under head coach Gary Fallon.
But Homecoming against H-SC
has been a different story. The
Generals and Tigers have met six
times on Homecoming, and the
best the Generals have managed

is a tie. The last W&L win over
H-SC on Wilson Field came in
1980, 17-13.

In 1988, W&L almost pulled
of an upset on Homecoming
against the Tigers. W&L led 7-0
on a Mason Pope four-yard touch-
down run and led 10-3 in the
second half. But the Tigers tied
the game at 10-10 on the last
play of the half on a hail mary
pass from Dan Laramore to Ste-
ven Waskey, covering 51 yards
on the last play of the half.

In the second half, the teams
traded field goals before H-SC
took control. Punter Tom Skeen
was sacked in the end zone for a
safety when the snap went over
his head. H-SC extended the lead
to 22-13 on a Chris Underwood
18-yard touchdown run.

But the Generals didn’t quit.
Tony Onorato brought the crowd
to its feet and the Generals back
in the game. He intercepted a
fumble and rambled 82 yards for
a touchdown to make the score
22-20, but the onside kick attempt
failed and the Tigers ran out the
clock for the win.

Last season, the Generals
made a Homecoming crowd hap-
py with a 26-10 win over Mary-
ville. Brad Miller broke open a
13-3 game with a 42-yard inter-
ception retum for a touchdown,
and Phillip Sampson broke the
school-record for career touch-
down passes when he connected
with Craig Irons for a 28-yard
score. Earlier in the game, Samp-
