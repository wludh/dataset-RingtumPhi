The Law School faculty defeated Monday
jby tie vote a policy amendment that would
have allowed the military to use law campus
‘placement facilities, a law professor said.

The law faculty voted 10-10 to amend its
Feb. 11 policy change that prevents emp-
‘loyers that lawfully discriminate against
, homosexuals from using the school’s place-
ment facilities, the professor, who declined
‘to be identified, said.

Law School Dean Randall Bezanson,
chairman of the law faculty meetings, refused
‘to cast a vote to break the tie, and the am-

'

endment failed, the law professor said.

An amendment to law faculty policy
Tequires majority vote to pass. Pursuant to
standard procedure, the chairman votes only
to break a tie.

At least five law professors contacted for
confirmation refused to comment on the
Monday meeting. One law professor said
Bezanson discouraged law faculty from dis-
cussing the meeting.

Bezanson would not comment on the
Monday faculty meeting.

He said the faculty’s Feb. 11 policy
change was ‘‘a judgement in a very respon-
sible and thorough fashion which seems to
have struck understandably raw nerves.

‘That judgement is one that has my

support,’’ he said, ‘‘though I confess also to
deep disappointment at the ways in which the
faculty’s decision has been characterized.’’

Richmond lawyer William R. Cogar, '51
and ’55L, sent a March 7 letter opposing the
law faculty policy to Bezanson and The
Richmond News Leader. The News Leader
printed the letter March 13.

Cogar’s letter asked Bezanson for a list of
current alumni with service affiliations. He
also asked Bezanson for a list of which law
faculty members who voted for the Feb. 11
policy change are ‘‘out of the closet.”’

Bezanson would not comment on the
Cogar letter.

Mitchel Neurock, ’92L, said he spoke to
University President John Wilson last week

about the policy. He called Wilson ‘‘und-
erstanding’’ and ‘‘very attentive.’

Neurock said he and other law students
opposed to the Feb. 11 policy began a let-
ter-writing appeal to the Board of Trustees.

Bezanson said he and Wilson are prepar-
ing a letter to the American Association of
Law Schools, an agency with which Wash-
ington and Lee is accredited.

The AALS passed a measure in August
that called on member-schools to pass policies
like that adopted at W&L.

“‘We are considering communicating to
the AALS our concern about the maelstrom
in which we’ve found ourselves,’’ Bezanson
said.

He said W&L and other private schools

Law policy stands on tie vote

are particularly in an ‘‘intolerable situation.”’
Public schools, he said, do not have to obey
the AALS policy in practice, because they are
legally required to permit military recruiters
to use their placement facilities.

Bezanson also said the Law School Place-
ment Office ‘‘will assist any student who has
an interest in interviewing with the military.”’
He said the office will continue to set ap-
pointments and placement counselling, but
interviews will probably move to the under-
graduate campus.

“I’ve drawn the line this way,’’ Bezanson
said. ‘‘To the extent that the policy would
contain any implication that we should tum
our backs on assisting students in seeking
employment, we will not read it that way.”’

‘Neville Brothers to play W&L in May

 

, By Jason Kelley
Senior Copy Editor

 

‘ The Student Activities Board has scheduled the

Neville Brothers to play in the Pavilion May 17,

"however possible EC action may stop the concert.

/ SAB President Katie Duwel said yesterday the

board has finalized the date with the band’s agent

' and is awaiting the arrival of the contract in the

, mail. But Law School EC representatives have

objected to the proposed date because law exams

! will be completed, and most first and second-year
students will already have left for the summer.

Duwel said the SAB tried to arrange an earlier

+ date, but May 17 was the earliest the Neville

Brothers could play.

‘*We tried to be as accommodating as possible,
but the dates just didn’t work out,’’ Duwel said.
“It’s either do it the 17th or not do it at all.’”’

Duwel criticized EC President-elect and second
year law Rep. Giles Perkins for making it ‘‘a
personal crusade.”’

“‘He’s a second-year law student so he won’t
be here for the concert,’’ she said.

The EC will vote Monday night on whether or
not to stop the concert, but Duwel said if the
contract comes before then, the entertainment
director intends to sign and return it to the agent.

Grant Burns, president of the Student Bar
Association, said he felt it was unfortunate that the
only date available was after law exams, but that

the SAB should go ahead with the concert.

‘I’m sure she [Duwel] has taken the law
students into consideration and done the best she
could,’’ Burns said. '

For her part, Duwel said she feels since the
EC appointed her to run SAB,.if the board has
the money to pay for the concert, it should be her
decision whether or not to go ahead with it.

’ Duwel said this is only the latest round in a
continuing struggle between law students and
undergraduates over scheduling of campus events.

‘‘We went through all this before with Fancy
Dress,’’ she said. ‘‘I’m not going to be heid
hostage by 200 students who aren’t going to be
here and not provide entertainment for the other
1,500 who will be here.’’

New sorority
bid endorsed

Hopes of reduced chapter
sizes prompt housing talks

 

By Pamela Kelley
Staff Reporter

 

The Panhellenic Council formal-
ized on Tuesday a proposal discussed
last week to invite Pi Beta Phi Soror-
ity to colonize at Washington and
Lee.

The invitation to the fourth soror-
ity, nationally known as Pi Beta Phi,
is part of an effort by the PHC to
reduce the size of the three sororities
already on campus.

The proposal, which must next be
considered by the Student Affairs
Committee, was submitted by the
Panhellenic Publicity and Extension
Committee. It outlined the ‘‘inability
of Delta Gamma to realize a chap-
ter,”’ the three W&L sororities’ desire
to maintain chapters of around 70
members, and a recommendation that
Pi Phi be extended an invitation to
colonize here immediately.

‘*... Size has handicapped efforts
to organize activities and form a truly
close sisterhood. At the Panhellenic
level, it stands in the way of future
plans concerning housing. We expect
as many or more freshmen women to
go through Rush next year, which
means the problem will only continue
to worsen unless action is taken,’’ the
proposal said.

The proposal indicated it would
immediately organize presentations
from other sororities wishing to colo-
nize here if Pi Phi declines to estab-
lish a colony. The proposal suggests
a lowering of the quota system for
Kappa Alpha Theta, Chi Omega and
Kappa Kappa Gamma sororities to
provide a larger pledge class for the
new sorority, which would rush at the
same time as the other three.

Committee Chairman Sonja Till-
berg said the Panhellenic Council’s
adopted proposal will be sent to the
SAC for approval no later than next
week. Panheilenic President Dale
Wyatt said she expects the SAC will
accept the recommendation to invite
Pi Phi.

“Once we send the letter the ball
is in their court,’’ said Tillberg.

Associate Dean of Students for
Greek Affairs Leroy ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins
said last week the addition of one
more sorority would ‘‘alleviate but
not solve’ the high chapter numbers
in W&L sororities. Atkins estimated
although two or three more chapters
will probably be necessary to solve
the problem of high chapter numbers,
**you can’t just start with six.’’

Atkiris also discussed how’ the
high chapter totals have affected
arrangements for sorority housing,
saying until sororities reach their
ideal chapter sizes, planing will re-
main vague. ‘‘And its hard to say
when they will be down to size.”’

W&L Treasurer Lawrence Broom-
all said last week the sorority housing
issue is ‘‘nebulous at best,’’ although
the university remains committed to
provide accommodations for W&L
sororities as part of the Fraternity
Renaissance plan.

Broomall also said the addition of
several other sororities would not
“‘put a damper’’ on such intentions.
He estimated sororities will not
receive housing for three to five
years.

As a condition of the university-
enforced Greek fee sororities were
told they would be given office space
in the soon-to-be-renovated University

Thief gets
120 days in
Wé&L heist

By Chris Simon
Staff Reporter

 

A Delaware man was sentenced to
120 days in the Rockbridge County
Jail March 12 after he broke into
Washington and Lee dormitory rooms
and escaped with $1,700 in stereo
equipment and compact discs.

David William Rivera, 34, pled
guilty to one charge of trespass and
three charges of petit larceny. District
Court Judge Joseph Hess sentenced
Rivera to four consecutive 30-day
terms in jail.

Rivera had been charged on two
counts of grand larceny following his
arrest Feb, 22. His penalty was re-
duced in exchange for a guilty plea.

Rivera was arrested after a W&L
student called security to report a
man selling stereo equipment in the
dorms. Head of Security Charles
‘‘Murph’’ Murray found Rivera short-
ly thereafter and held the suspect
until police arrived.

Sergeant Richard Sutton of the
Lexington Police Department said
Rivera targeted student housing dur-
ing Washington Holiday. Sutton
said Rivera hoped to sell stolen mer-
chandise and use the money to travel
to New York or California.

Sutton said further legal action
would be pursued if the six W&L
students whose belongings were
found among the stolen goods decide
to press charges.

Professors chosen to replace retirees

 

By Scott Bronstein
Staff Reporter

 

Two new department heads and
one new professor will begin teach-
ing at the beginning of next year to
replace three retiring professors.

Roger A. Crockett will succeed
Buford F. Stephenson as head of the
German department and John Harrah
will succeed Henry Sharp as head of
the Mathematics department.

The University also hired Pulitzer
Prize-winning editorial writer Edwin
Yoder to replace Jounmalism Profes-
sor Clark Mollenhoff. Yoder will
begin teaching in 1992 after he fin-
ishes writing a book.

Crockett, a graduate of Wake
Forest University, received his Ph.D.
at the University of Illinois, and has
taught for ten years at Texas A&M.
University. He specializes in 19th and
20th-century German literature and
ran a nationally recognized program
at Texas A&M. that featured plays
produced by students entirely in Ger-
man,

Harrah, a Lexington native, grad:
udated from Haverford College with
a B.A. in Mathematics. He received
a Ph.D. in Mathematics from U.C.
Berkley. He taught at Columbia Uni-
versity, University of Maryland and,
most recently, at Michigan University.
In addition to department head, he
will also be the Roupret and Lillian
Radford Professor of Mathematics.

Elizabeth Oliver will replace Jay
Cook in the Accounting department.
She is a graduate of Mary Baldwin

College, and received her Masters
degree in Accounting from the Uni-
versity of Virginia. She is currently
working towards her Ph.D. at Texas
A&M Oliver will be the first female
accounting professor at Washington
and Lee.

A total of five professors will
retire at the end of the year.

Professor Westbrook Barritt has
been in phased retirement, and his
successor, Prof. Jeffrey Barnett is
already teaching classes at W&L. No
replacement has yet been found for
Literature professor Sydney Coulling,
despite two national searches.

According to Commerce School
Dean Larry Peppers, all professors
must retire when they reach age 65.
They may, however, work on a year-
to-year basis with half the class load
up until age 70. This allows the
University to hire new _ professors,
making the transition smoother when
one professor retires, Peppers said.

Peppers said hiring new professors
is a challenging task.

“It is always difficult to find
prople of the quality that are leaving.
We have to replace seasoned and
outstanding teachers, while not letting
our standards drop,’’ Peppers said.

W&L generally conducts a nation-
al search for applicants by sending
representatives to conferences and
conventions, and then inviting those
who seem qualified to submit applica-
tions. The field is narrowed down to
about four applicants, and they are
invited to Lexington for an interview
before the search committee makes a
hiring decision.

 

 

Columnist Yoder joins J-School

 

By Joshua Manning
Staff Reporter

 

Nationally-syndicated Pulitzer Prize-winning colum-
nist Edwin M. Yoder Jr. will join the Washington and
Lee faculty in January.

Yoder’s appointment as Professor of Journalism and
Mass Communications was announced Tuesday by
Professor Hampden H. Smith, chairman of the
Journalism department, and Dean of the College John
W. Elrod.

‘*This is a very important appointment,’’ said Elrod.
‘‘We’re fortunate to have one Pulitzer Prize winner on
the faculty so closely following another.’’

Yoder’s arrival on campus was originally set to
coincide with the retirement of Professor Clark R.
Mollenhoff, also a Pulitzer Prize winner.

Since University policy requires all faculty members
to retire at age 70, Smith said the Journalism depart-
ment searched for Mollenhoff’s successor for several
years.

Mollenhoff, who died this month, was due to retire
in June.

Smith said the University first became interested in
hiring Yoder while he was a guest lecturer on campus
during November 1989, Conversations began soon
after the highly successful visit.

Yoder was the Journalism department’s first choice
for the position, said Smith.

‘*All of us here in the department are very
excited,’ said Smith. ‘‘I don’t think it is ever possible
to replace Clark [Mollenhoff], but Ed [Yoder] is
uniquely qualified as a professor."’

Yoder, 56, graduated from the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill and then studied at Oxford
University in England as a Rhodes Scholar.

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, March 21, 1991

 

we ug et
All quiet on the

law school front

Controversy continues over the Law School’s decision to
adhere to accrediting board requirements that prohibit
organizations engaging in legal discriminatory practices from
recruiting on member campuses. This essentially means that
military organizations are barred from appearing on campus
to hire people on a full-time basis.

The various sides of the issue have been covered at
length here on our pages, and on the pages and editorial
columns of newspapers around the state. Yes, the military
discriminates against homosexuals, and discrimination is
wrong. But the Supreme Court upheld the ban against
homosexuals; and the act of sodomy is illegal in Virginia.
Yes, the Law School would have risked losing its
accreditation by not banning discriminatory organizations, but
many feel the accrediting body has over-stepped its bounds
by meddling in the area of sexual orientation. Furthermore,
a majority of law students want the school to risk its
accreditation, even though it could harm their standing with
potential employers, so that they can retain autonomy in
deciding whom to interview with.

We will not delve into all the issues and all the aspects
of this case, for it has already been thoroughly covered by
several newspapers including our own. We would, however,
be interested in knowing what the faculty who voted this
ban into existence think about the issue. It seems they are
the only ones who haven’t interjected their opinions into the
marketplace of ideas.

The best information we can get tells us that the latest

 

 

law school faculty vote deadlocked at 10-10. The ultimate
validity of this claim unfortunately remains a mystery. The
figure has yet to be officially confirmed. Dean Bezanson,
who has remained decidedly vague since this whole debacle
erupted, held the tie-breaking vote. He chose not to cast that
vote — again, as far as we can tell.

It’s hard to believe that a man of the intelligence and
stature of Dean Bezanson would be having a difficult time
formulating an opinion on this matter. It seems far more
likely that he has made up his mind and has chosen to keep
his decision a big secret; he’s doing a fine job of it.

If only Bezanson would see it in his heart to enlighten
the rest of us, we could stop speculating and contribute
some rational analysis based on confirmed facts to the
discussion. Wouldn’t we all like to see this debate raised to
a higher level?

This is not the first time secrecy has reared it’s ugly head
here at Washington and Lee — merely the latest. Not only
are we denied the reasoning behind the law professors’
decisions, but we don’t even know who supported the ban.
The participants just aren’t talking.

It’s a shame the law school faculty is unwilling to
enhance free debate on this subject. The purpose of this
institution is to educate it’s students, not mystify them.

THE SBAR SIDE
By Jon Sbar

 

It has beady eyes, a bulbous
head, a scaly back, a long forked
tongue, stumpy legs, reptile eyes and
a very bad attitude. It slinks around
on it’s belly and loves to eat. It
sleeps fifteen hours a day. It is a girl
that I recently woke up with in bed
after a night of heavy drinking. Of
course, that was just a tasteless joke.
Actually, It is a three-foot-long Asian
lizard, who has moved into my house
until it’s owner returns from Spring
Break. Demonstrating my ability to
coin clever nicknames, I have been
calling my new roommate ‘‘Lizard.”’

The reason that I mention Lizard
is because he reminds me of a letter
I received from a concerned reader in
Mexico named Joe. Since the letter
was addressed to ‘‘Mr. Manners,”’
my instinct was to throw it in the
trash. Then from deep inside the dim
passages of my memory, I recalled
that in a drug-crazed stupor I once
wrote a column announcing myself as
the new manners columnist and
encouraged people to write me with
their etiquette questions. Joe’s letter
is one of the few that I can print in
this family-oriented newspaper. Most
of the etiquette questions I received
involved disgusting bodily functions.

Dear Mr. Manners: My name is
Joe. I’m from Mexico, and I have a
pet iguana named ‘‘Iguana.’’ The

other day Iguana and I were walking
home from school (it was show and
tell day) when I noticed that my
attractive female neighbor, Betty, who
has large breasts, was swimming
naked in her pool. Thinking that it
would make a good joke and wanting
to move in for a closer look, I snuck
into her back yard and dropped
Iguana in the pool. When Iguana
swam up to her and climbed onto her
back, Betty nearly had heart failure.
I’ve never seen a naked woman swim
so fast. Betty called my Mom to
complain and now me and Iguana are
both on restriction. Do you think I
showed bad manners by dropping
Iguana in Betty’s pool and deserved
to be punished?

Dear Gentle Reader Joe: Before
we get to your question, Mr. Manners
would like to ask a few of his own.
If you live in Mexico, how come
your letter was written in English and
not Spanish? Couldn’t you have
thought of a more original name for
your pet iguana? Aren’t you a little
young to be sneaking up on naked
women? Just how big are Betty’s
breasts? Addressing your situation,
Mr. Manners thinks that your little
prank was inappropriate, devious and
cruel. However, it was hilarious and
therefore justified like all good
pranks. Mr. Manners is sure that
Betty will thank you some day when
she uses the prank on a friend. Even
if she doesn’t, at least you got to see
her naked.

Okay, okay, I confess that I took

a little poetic license with Joe’s letter.
In fact, I took more than poetic
license. There is no Mexican youth
named Joe with a pet iguana named
“‘Iguana’’ and an attractive neighbor
named Betty. Or if there is, he never
wrote me a letter. I realize that my
little letter prank was inappropriate,
devious and cruel. However, it was
hilarious and therefore justified. But
I’m sure Betty will thank...wait a
second, that sounds awfully familiar.
It’s Deja Vu! I feel like I wrote
those very same lines in another life
in another era in another paragraph.
Please pardon that Deja Vu
diversion, readers. It’s time I
answered a real letter I received from
a girl who attends Kenyon College.
{Ed note: For those who tend to
view anything written in this
column with utter and complete
skepticism, rest assured the letter is
real. Mr. Sbar received it in
October, and has been fighting his
natural inertia to answer it ever
since. — C.B.] The girl identified
herself as ‘‘The Wild Runaway.”’
Due to space limitations, | was forced
to condense the letter considerably.
Dear Mr. Manners: I am a
gullible, friendly blonde who gets
drunk quite easily. I have the
tendency to wander after consuming
excessive amounts of cherry wine
coolers, and on various occasions I
have wandered away from my
friends. Because of my wandering
tendencies, my friends are now in the
habit of leaving without me when we

are out at night and they decide to go
home. This is inconvenient because’
my friends frequently leave me,
assuming that I have disappeared
again. Do my friends have a
responsibility to look out for me or
are they entitled not to worry since I
have been rude enough to leave them;
in the past?

Dear Gentle Reader ‘Wild’
Runaway:’’ First of all, could you,
send Mr. Manners your phone
number and revealing photographs of"
yourself in sexy lingerie? Mr.
Manners loves to date gullible,’
friendly blondes who get drunk easily,
on cherry wine coolers. Now, to
address your etiquette question. Since
you have written Mr. Manners such a
nice letter and complimented his’
writing, he has no choice but to rule,
in your favor. Your friends (and Mr.
Manners uses the term loosely)
should never go home without,
finding you (unless you are with Mr.
Manners). They must locate you and‘
escort you safely into your bed, even,
if it means staying out until dawn

Bezanson needs
to take a side
on controversy

The law school faculty recently voted for the
third time on the issue of military recruitment.
The faculty had previously voted twice to deny
the military the right to interview on the law
campus because the military discriminates on the
basis of sexual preference. Congress and the
Supreme Court have already ruled that such
discrimination by the military is legal.

This time the vote concerned a compromise
proposal by Prof. McThenia, the details of which
faculty members were discouraged from
discussing in public. The vote came out 10-10,
but Dean Randall P. Bezanson refused to cast the
deciding vote. What a surprise. The Dean has
never made public his personal view of this
issue, and has now refused to go on record even
when the faculty vote was tied.

Dean Bezanson’s failure to take a stand on
this issue has left the law school in limbo. The
faculty is unable to affirm or recant its prior
pronouncements on the issue of freedom of
recruitment. And the students, meanwhile, are
unsure whether the military ban will ever go into
effect. Apparently the Board of Trustees will be
forced to take up the matter when it meets again
this spring.

It looks as if Dean Bezanson has decided to
take a similar approach to that of Gov. Wilder
on the VMI issue. The Dean’s waffling has left
everyone uneasy about the tone and substance of
events to come. In trying not to offend anyone,
the Dean has in fact offended students and
faculty alike, and has allowed the law school
community to slip into a frustrating and
embarrassing stalemate.

The Dean has unfortunately forgotten (if he
ever learned) a maxim which all military officers
know: "When in charge, take charge.” A strong
Dean does not "stand firmly in two places.” By
exercising proper leadership over the faculty, the
Dean could have prevented this matter from
becoming the source of divisiveness and

 

LETTERS

controversy.

Dean Bezanson could have put a stop to this
nonsense by casting a vote against the
recruitment ban, contingent on the results of a
protest to the AALS. Or he could have
unilaterally overruled the faculty, pending further
review by the Board of Trustees. The Dean could
thus have proven himself to be a Students’
Dean," as his predecessors have been and as his
successors hopefully will be.

By the same token, if the Dean thought our
AALS accreditation was so important, he could
have voted for the policy. His silence on this
issue suggests to me _ that the faculty’s
accreditation concerns are merely a smokescreen
for deeper political motives. By voting for the
faculty policy, the Dean would have at least
demonstrated some backbone, a _ prime
qualification for any leadership position. But in
his attempt to straddle the fence, the Dean has
succeeded only in ripping his pants.

Professors are now expressly discouraged by
the Dean from discussing the vote totals or even
the content of compromise proposals. If the
faculty is so proud of its action in banning
military recruiters, why the secrecy? If banning
the military from campus is a courageous act,
then the faculty should have no need for a “Cone
of Silence." Let them trumpet their reasoning and
opinions in public, for all to see and evaluate.
Let them demonstrate their courage in the open,
instead of behind closed doors, They have
judged; let them now prepare to be judged.

It’s difficult to pin down a faculty member
who voted for the restriction of free recruitment,
but there is certainly no shortage of opponents.
Perhaps our faculty doesn’t feel that a matter
such as job placement is a legitimate student
concern. (The signatures of over 60% of the law
school student body certainly didn’t mean much
to them.) If the faculty is of the opinion that the
students support them, we students are already
proving them wrong.

I think it unfortunate that this whole matter
could not be settled in-house. We have gone
through all possible internal channels, seeking
compromise, but our efforts have been denied by
an obstinate, shortsighted faculty. The faculty’s
refusal to compromise has left us students with
no choice but to take the matter public.

Hopefully W & L alumni will continue to
speak with their wallets and checkbooks as well

as their voices. Hopefully they will see through '

the law faculty’s political posturing and withhold
contributions to the university until this matter is
settled. Hopefully the faculty will come to its
senses and realize that not only are they in the
minority on this issue, but that they will never be
able to make such a ban meaningful so long as
there is determined student resistance.
Freedom of recruitment is no longer an issue
for the law school alone. Our entire university is
getting a black eye in the press; our prestige is
on the line. Our tradition of close student-faculty
relations is in jeopardy. And for what? Meek
capitulation to an outsider’s notions of "proper"
employment for law students. All we students
seek is the right to interview, at the law school,
with whomever we wish, so long as employers
are complying with the law. Nothing more. We
are not asking the faculty to condone illegal
activity. This campus is supposed to be a forum
for the free expression of ideas. The law
faculty's restriction of that freedom for its own
political gain is unacceptable, especially when
this gain comes at the expense of students.
Sincerely,
Mitch Neurock, 2nd Lt., USAF, ’92L

Superdance
thanks extended

We would like to extend our greatest
appreciation to all those who made 1990-91 such
a great year for Superdance. Our thanks go to
the parents, local merchants, student organizations
and the W&L community who donated their
services, money and prizes. We would especially
like to thank the Superdance chairmen and
members who put in the hours to make the
events throughout the year, not only a success,
but fun.

And to the Fontanne, thank you for
everything! We hope future Superdances will
have your guidance.

Good luck next year,

IFC bans communal alcohol

 

 

By Kim Boots
Staff Reporter

 

The Phi Delta Theta fraternity
has found that the Interfraternity
Council and the Student Conduct
Committee are taking a stricter at-
titude toward damaging newly
renovated fraternity houses, said
Phi Delt President Foster Bow-
man.

Parts of the Phi Delt house
were damaged during the first
Wednesday night party there, Bow-
man said. However, he refused to
give details about the nature of the
damage, who caused it or how
they were punished. He did say
that the fraternity took the
inforreation to the IFC and the

 

Phi Delt president says
IFC, SCC stricter now

SCC, which have dealt with the
incident.

Bowman commented that the
damage to the house ‘‘would not
have even been considered damage
in years past. If we were in the
same situation we were in last
year, it wouldn’t have been an
ordeal.

‘*Fraternities are going to find
that the Hill and student govern-
ment will be doing everything
from a harsher viewpoint.”’

Tom Hatcher, Executive
Committee president and a member
of Phi Delt said, ‘‘We did run into
some problems’ based on
unpreparedness.’’ He added that
as a result of the incident the
house has banned bottle beverages
from house parties.

The Interfraternity Council clari-
fied its no-keg rule this week, assert-
ing that communal sources of alcohol
are also illegal under its constitution.

The IFC passed a rule banning
kegs last fall. According to IFC
President Goodloe Lewis, fraternity
members have often simply brought
loose cans and bottles of beerto their
housesand put them in garbage cans
of ice as keg substitutes.

The IFC officially decided Tues-
day to prohibit this practice. Lewis
said that the penalty for this offense
will possibly be social probation, but
that each case will be handled at
IFC’s discretion.

Lewis added that the rule might
be subject to change when the new
IFC takes over in three weeks.

In other business, the IFC dis-

cussed Buildings and Grounds’ accu-
sation that earlier this month fraterni-
ty pledges took mattresses that had
been provided by the university for
prospective students. B&G claims
the mattresses were carried from the
dormitories to pledges’ fraternity
houses.

When B&G tried to retrieve the
mattresses after the weekend, they
found that many were missing. Lewis
said that B&G wrote a letter to the
IFC speculating that pledges took
them to their fraternity houses to
sleep on during initiation week.

Lewis denied the accusation. He
said that he thinks people surely
would have noticed anyone walking
down the street with the missing
mattresses.

The mattresses still have not been
located. Anyone with information
concerning these missing mattresses
should contact Buildings and
Grounds.

Record number attend FD City mails

 

By Craig Burke
Staff Reporter

 

700 pounds of ice and 450 liters
of Coke, but no cups.

Fancy Dress Chairman John
Flippen faced this situation Friday,
March 8, during the Fancy Dress
Ball.

‘‘We realized about 9 o’clock that
we had forgotten to buy cups,”
Flippen said. ‘‘Dabney Collier had
to run out to East Lex and buy 4,000
keg cups.’’

Despite this glitch the 84th Fancy
Dress Ball was a huge success,
Flippen and FD Vice Chairwoman
Susie Wooten said.

Ticket sales raised about $70,000,
just shy of the $75,000 goal, Flippen
said.

Though fewer tickets were sold
than in previous years, a record 3,500
people attended the ‘‘Royal Festival
at King Arthur’s Court,’’ he said.
Flippen attributed this to increased
turnout from faculty, administration,
and staff.

Both  Flippen and Wooten said

they were thrilled with the decora-
tions and the fact that everyone
seemed to be enjoying themselves.

‘‘When I saw the gym on Friday,
everything just seemed to fit,”
Wooten said.

60 contract workers and 50 SAB
members worked in shifts from 10
am. to 10 p.m. for 11 days to
prepare the Warner Center for the
Ball.

‘‘l was impressed with the work-
ers who helped put Fancy Dress
together,’ Flippen said. ‘‘Our 110
workers were people from every class
and every fraternity and sorority, and
they worked together to create Fancy
Dress.”’

Several items were taken from the
Ball, including a banner, a wall tap-
estry, and four brass rubbings. These
decorations were rented from Back-
stage, Inc. in Richmond and are
valued at $2,000.

‘Obviously somebody made a
mistake and thought we made these
decorations,’’ Wooten said. iE
anyone has any information concern-
ing these items, they can call the
SAB office at 463-8585.”’

 

 

 

Katie Duwel

SAB Chairwoman Katie Duwel
said the great success of this year’s
FD was due to the planning done by
Flippen and Wooten.

Flippen said he doesn’t want to be
FD Chairman next year.

‘‘T don’t want to try to top this
FD,’’ he said.

 

YODER

from page 1

 

Yoder won the 1979 Pulitzer Prize in Editorial Writing

for his work with The Star.

Since 1982, Yoder has written a nationally syndicated
column for the Washington Post Writers Group. The
column appears twice a week in 65 newspapers across the
country including The Washington Post and The Richmond

Times-Dispatch.

Yoder has completed two books and is currently
writing a third. The Night of the Old South Ball, published
in 1984, is a collection of essays originally appearing in

the Greensboro paper and The Star.

The Unmaking of a Whig, published last year, is a
collection of autobiographical sketches,

lectures.

Yoder is now working on a book about columnists
Joseph and Stewart Alsop. The book, which Yoder descr-

late notices
for car tax

By Greg Patterson
Staff Reporter

 

 

Lexington city officials have
begun to send out delinquent notices
to students who have not paid their
car tax bills.

According to City Treasurer Pat
DeLaney, delinquent notices were
sent out on Tuesday to students
whose bills were due on March 14,
She said she did not know how many
were sent.

DeLaney said that people who
receive the notices will be given an
“appropriate amount of time’’ to pay
the tax plus an additional late charge
before they will be notified of ‘‘the
possibility of court action.”’

DeLaney said that some people
who have already paid might get
delinquent notices since she received
some payments the same day the
notices were sent.

In January, the Executive Commit- :

tee voted to implement a boycott of
city businesses by the student body,
but the boycott was postponed when
city officials agreed to meet with
student representatives to discuss the
tax.

EC President Tom Hatcher has
since said he does not consider the
boycott a viable option because it
‘twould hurt the wrong people.’’

Pete Silvain, '93L, who was re-
cruited by Hatcher to research the
legal angle of the issue says he be-
lieves the best course for students to
take is to sign an exemption with the
city.

Exemption can be obtained by
signing a form in the city treasurer’s
office. A student must prove either
that his car is housed outside
Lexington for more than six months
of the year or that he already pays a
personal property tax on his car at
home.

From Press Releases

Former Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto will
speak at Sweet Briar College’s Babcock Auditorium April
11 at 8 p.m.

Forced out of office by a military-backed constitutional
coup in August 1990, Bhutto is currently the leader of the
Opposition party in Pakistan.

Born in 1953, Bhutto attended Harvard University and
Lady Margaret Hall in Oxford. Bhutto was under house
arrest from 1974 to 1984, and spent two years as leader
in exile of the Pakistan Peoples’ Party with her mother
Nusrat.

Bhutto was elected Prime Minister in 1988, just two
years after returning from exile in the United Kingdom.
During her twenty-month reign, Bhutto restored
constitutional freedoms and initiated measures for
separating the judiciary from the executive branch. Her
government built 8000 public and secondary schools and
brought electricity to 4600 villages.

Bhutto received the Phi Beta Kappa Award from
Radcliffe College in 1989 and an honorary Doctor of
Laws degree from Harvard University. She is the recipient
of the Bruno Kreisky Award for Human Rights, the
Liberal International Woman of the Year Award for 1989,
the Averell Harriman Democracy Award and the United
Nations Development Fund for Women Award in 1990.

Bhutto has written two books, Foreign Policy in
Perspective (1987) and Daughter of The East (1988).

Bhutto’s lecture is free and open to the public.

Atkins said there is no correlation
with the future vacancy of the three

sorority probably could not fit its
entire chapter into one of the fraterni-

He said the Sigma Chi House
would make a ‘‘great location for the

a possible Dean of Students office.
Kappa Sigma might be used, for
example, as a foreign language house.

Costello, Generals ranked 6th in nation

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

The Washington and Lee men’s
lacrosse team got a wake up call
Wednesday from Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference foe Lynchburg, and
the Generals looked upset to be a-
wakened.

The Generals, ranked 6th in the

»* latest Division III poll, gave up two

' year to an unranked team,”
' Stagnitta. ‘‘That loss kept us out of

goals in the first 2:50 before scoring
seven of the next eight goals to take

. a 7-3 halftime lead on the way to a

14-5 win.
Actually, said W&L head coach

- Jim Stagnitta, the wake-up call came
- last year, when the Hornets upset the

Generals 7-6 in overtime.
“‘Lynchburg was our one loss last
said

the NCAA tournament. It gave us a

_ lot of incentive for this year.’’

Stagnitta said the players may
have been a little too excited, and
that led to the early goals.

**We were so pumped up that it
hurt us,’’ he said. ‘‘We were over-
playing too much. It was scary seeing
them get the goals early, but we got
the goals back pretty quickly and that
was good.’’

After LC, ranked 20th in Division
III, took the 2-0 lead, junior Drew
Anton scored twice in 21 seconds to
tie the game at 2-2. Later in the
quarter, junior Jeff Roberts scored
twice in a row, once off an Anton
feed, and the Generals led 4-2 after a
quarter.

W&L scored three times in the
final 2:31 of the second quarter to
take a 7-3 halftime lead. Sophomore
John Hunter scored, and senior Todd
Garliss scored a little less than a
minute later off another feed from

Anton. Sophomore Jay West scored
16 seconds before halftime to provide
the margin.

Lynchburg scored to make it 7-4
early in the third quarter, but from
that point on, W&L took control and
put the Hormets away.

W&L scored seven of the last
eight goals of the game, including
two each from Roberts, Garliss and
Anton. Senior Clark Wight also
scored for the Generals. Senior goalie
Tom Costello and the W&L defense
held Lynchburg scoreless for the final
25:39,

‘For the first time in my two
years here,’’ he said, ‘‘we’re starting
to put teams away. We hadn’t done
that in the past. Now we're playing
complete games and playing them
confidently.’’

Roberts and Anton both had four

added three goals for the Generals.
Costello was again strong in the goal,

straight time. -

“Drew Anton has become a big
part of our offense,’’ said Stagnitta,

Stagnitta was pleased with the
performance, but he still thinks the
offense needs to convert its opportu-

shots.

good transition,’’ he said, ‘‘but we
need to finish. We can’t afford to

W&L golfers open year with strong showing in tourneys

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

The Washington and Lee golf
team may be the most unnoticed team
on campus. It might also be the best.

Last year, a sophomore dominated
team finished seventh at the NCAA
Division III championships, and in
1991 the group of juniors picked up
where they left off.

In the prestigious Gordon Colle-
giate Classic in Myrtle Beach, S.C.,
W&L placed seventh in the 12-team
field. The 12 teams were the top 12
finishers in last year’s NCAA tourna-
ment.

“We showed that last year’s
finish wasn’t a fluke and that we
deserve to be among the nation’s
best,’’ said senior captain Brian

Kopet. ‘‘It was a good start to the
season.”’

W&L shot 668 for the. two-day
tournament, 30 strokes behind Meth-
odist, who showed that last year’s
NCAA Championship wasn’t a fluke
in winning the first event of 1991.

Junior Jay McKnight led W&L
with a total of 163, including a 79 on
the second day. McKnight was one of
only 16 of the 60 golfers to break 80
in tough conditions.

“‘The course was long, and it was
cold and windy,’’ said Kopet. ‘‘The
course played really tough, and Jay
played really well.’’

Head coach Buck Leslie said the
tournament had the flavor of an
NCAA championship tournament.

“It definitely had the flavor of
the NCAAs,”’ he said. ‘‘Some teams
had done a lot of work, and some

hadn’t done as much work. I thought
we put in a pretty solid effort.”’

While the tournament saw good
golf, it also saw excellent treatment
of the players also.

“The tournament itself was a first
class event,’’ he said. ‘‘It’s the best
run tournament I’ve ever been in-
volved-with.”’ : ile

Kopet agreed that the tournament
was more than good golf.

“This is easily the best tourna-
ment we’ve ever played in,’’ he said.
“They treated the players great. The
NCAA wasn’t bad last year, but this
is how you run a tournament.’

After the trip to Myrtle Beach,
W&L returned to Virginia to play in
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference/Lynchburg Invitational, and
after proving to themselves they

belonged among the nation’s elite, the
Generals proved it to their ODAC
foes.

Kopet led the way with a 79, and

the Generals shot 325 on the day, 14
points better than second-place Roa-
noke. It was W&L’s depth that made
the difference.
*“**We Rad the second through sixth
best scores,’’ said Kopet. ‘‘Everyone
played solid, and the team played
better than a 325 might show. The
wind was rough and it was cold. We
played about as well as we could.”’

Kopet finished second on the day.
He was beaten out by one stroke by
the final golfer to finish.

‘The course was tougher than the
one in Myrtle Beach,’’ he said. ‘‘I
started strong but ran into some trou-
ble. On the back nine, though, I shot

McKnight and classmates Clay

Leslie was pleased with the depth

_ CRE ae Ae
By Phil Spears
Staff Reporter

 

In last year’s 5-15 season, the
Washington and Lee baseball team
was hampered by an inept offense
and error-prone defense.

This season the Generals got off
to a perfect 4-0 start in 1991 and
showed signs of overcoming the
problems that plagued the team last
year.

But, despite a vastly improved
offensive attack, the lack of both
pitching depth and, again, a steady
defense have recently emerged as
obstacles that head coach Jeff Stick-
ley’s young team must overcome if
they are to continue their winning
ways.

Last Saturday, in Ashland, Va.,
the Generals were the victims of a
no-hitter, dropping a tough 1-0 loss
in the opening game of a doublehead-
er with Randolph-Macon.

R-MC hurler Matt Bitsko shut
down the Generals’ much-improved
offense in the first game. The Gener-
als were able to put the ball in play,
only striking out a total of three
times. However, Bitsko’s pinpoint
control and variety of off-speed offer-
ings produced a bevy of ground-ball
outs. Of W&L’s 21 outs, 13 came on
ground balls.

Stickley attributed some of
W&L’s ineffective hitting to a lack
of practice time during the week
because of rain and snow. But, he
said, Bitsko deserves all the credit.

‘He kept us off balance the entire
game,’’ said Stickley. ‘‘It was too
bad he [Bitsko] had to spoil a great
performance from Steve [Momo-
rellaj.”’

Momorella, W&L’s best pitcher,
proved Bitsko’s equal through the
first six innings of the seven-inning
contest. The junior allowed only three
hits through the first 6 innings. But
in the seventh, two singles and a
stolen base produced the lone run of
the game, and a R-MC victory.

Any thoughts that the Generals
outstanding jump out of the blocks in
1991 has been a fluke, or that the
offense would again tum anemic,
were quickly eliminated in game two
as the Generals pounded out eight
runs on 13 hits. Junior T.J. Daly

scattered eight hits and six runs for

ne Me Saat

his second complete game victory and
an 8-6 W&L win.

The Generals’ bats came to life
for Daly. In the top of the first,
back-to-back singles from hot-hitting
freshman Eric Peifer and senior Chris
Kavanagh, followed by a double from
senior Ron Katz, put the Generals in
front 2-0.

The Generals were shut down
over the next three innings and trailed

5-2 in the fifth, W&L responded by
scoring 2 runs in each of the last
three innings. Consecutive triples in
the fifth from senior J.T. Swartz and
junior Fred Renneker spearheaded the
charge.

Four singles produced two more
W&L runs in the sixth to tie the
game heading into the seventh at 6-
6. A single by Daly, a sacrifice by
Kavanagh, and a walk to Katz set the
table for sophomore Mike Steinbrook,
and he delivered.

With two on and two out, Stein-
brook connected for a two-run single
to give the Generals the victory. Katz
and Steinbrook both had two hits and
two RBI, and Daly, Peifer and
Swartz each had two hits.

‘‘We were real happy with the
win,”’ said Stickley. ‘‘It was tough to
come back like that after being no-
hit. T.J. [Daly] stayed on course with
his game. We’re playing pretty well
right now. Our guys are a lot more
confident at the plate. We need to
improve our defense because we’ve
got a tough week coming up.”’

On Tuesday, the defending regular
season Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference champion Hampden-Sydney
Tigers came calling on the Generals.

Stickley said his team would have
to make the routine plays Tuesday if
the Generals were going to challenge.
And to his dismay, Stickley proved
prophetic.

The Generals dropped a 9-5 deci-
sion to the Tigers in more ways than
one. W&L fell apart late in the game
after seven strong innings from
Momorella, who was pitching on two
days rest after throwing 100 pitches
against R-MC. W&L led 3-1 heading
into the eighth.

But the Generals couldn’t finish
the job.

“The wheels fell off,’’ said
Swartz, ‘‘and we just beat our-
selves.”’

Several errors behind Momorella
prompted Stickley to make a pitching
change. Three errors, a passed ball,
three walks, two stolen bases, three
hits and eight unearned runs later
W&L got the final out of the inning,
trailing 9-3.

“*T thought it [pulling Momorella|
was the right thing to do. Steve was
way past the pitch count we had set
for him. If we make the routine
plays, we get out of the inning.”’

Daly’s two-run home run in the
ninth provided the final margin of 9-
5. Daly and Peifer had three hits each
to lead the W&L attack. Daly also
drove in three runs. After the 4-0
start, W&L has lost three of four and
are now 5-3 and 1-3 in the ODAC
on the season.

Daly’s home run, his second,
pushed the Generals home-run total
for the year to four, one more than
they had all of last season.

Despite the loss, Stickley remained
opumustc,

“In some spots we're playing as
well as we can play,’’ he said. ‘‘We
did good things at the plate against a
real good pitcher [Scott Spears, 1990
first team All-OBAC], and we made
all the plays in the field except for
one inning. But, that’s what happens.
We're getting good efforts, we’ve just
got to be able to put teams away.’’

For the second straight year, soph-
omore Claire Dudley qualified for the
Division If NCAA Championships in
women’s swimming. But in 1991;
Dudley did not enjoy the same suc;
cess she had a year ago.

Dudley finished 32nd in the 200:-
breaststroke with a time of 2:32.46,
Although Dudley swam a faster race
than she did during the season, hey
time wasn’t fast enough to qualify for
All-America honors. In 1990, Dudley
was an Honorable Mention All-Amer,
ican.

‘‘Things got real quick,’’ she said!
“Even if I had swam like I did in
1990 when I finished 12th, |
wouldn’t have been in the top 20. }
don’t think I swam real well.”’

Dudley said she changed her
preparation pattern from 1990 to
1991. She worked harder with
weights this year as opposed to doing
more sprint work, like she did last
year.

“I didn’t have particularly good
meets either year,’’ she said. ‘‘Last
year I stopped lifting weights early
and swam more breaststroke in prac-
tice. I felt weak, so this year I lifted
all year and didn’t swim as much.’’

After seeing the results of both
styles of preparation, Dudley said she
wants a happy medium.

“IT think if I continue lifting
weights and swim more breaststroke
in practice, more sprint work, it
would help,’’ she said. ,

Dudley also said that academics
kept her less focused on swimming
than she usually is. )

“Academics played a burden,”’
she said. ‘I’m having a tough semes-
ter, and I knew I had a tough week
coming up [after the meet]. That
worried me a little, going away and
knowing I was going to fall behind
academically.’’

Dudley also swam in the 100
breaststroke and 200 individual med-
ley, but did not place in either event

ball away.’’

But when the offense is struggl-
ing, it’s nice to have a strong defense
to fall back on.

“Our defense has been terrific,’’
said offensive standout Roberts. ‘‘Cos
is having an awesome year. We're
allowing 12-yard shots, and he’s
making the saves.”’

Stagnitta was pleased with the
defense as well.

“‘Cos settled in and was excel-
lent,’’ he said. ‘‘It wasn’t our best
defensive effort, we made some mis-
takes and we fell down, but it was
pretty solid.’’

The effort comes after a 24-2
thrashing of Haverford in Pennsylva-
nia on Sunday. W2&L scored the
first 14 goals of the game and held
Haverford scoreless for almost 37
minutes.

Roberts was the offensive star. He
scored four goals, all in the first 18
minutes of the game. Wight scored
three times and added three assists,
and Garliss, freshman Scott Mackley
and sophomore John Hunter each
scored twice. Sophomore Rhett Han-
cock was the high goal scorer for
W&L, netting five in the fourth quar-
ter.

Stagnitta said it was nice that
everyone got to play, and contribute.

“Everyone contributed,’’ he said.
‘*We scored just as many goals with
the non-starters, and maybe got more
transition goals.’’

Costello made 11 saves without
allowing a goal and only played the
first half.

Against Division III competition,
Costello has registered 64 saves and
allowed only 21 goals, for a 75.3
percent rate. He has allowed just over
four goals a game against Division
III opponents.

“The rap on Cos was that he is
hot and cold,’’ said Stagnitta, ‘‘but
he hasn’t been cold this year.’’

Stagnitta said a lot of the credit in
Costello’s success belongs to W&L
Associate Athletic Director Chuck

O’Connell, who has spent time work-
ing with Costello.

“Chuck has spent a lot of time
working with Cos,’’ said Stagnitta,
‘‘and he has been a big difference.
Cos is stepping to the ball better and
the difference in his play from last
year to this year is like night and
day.”’

 

Junior Drew Anton moves toward the goal. Anton scored four
goals In W&L’s 14-5 win over Lynchburg Wednesday on Wilson
Field. Staff photo by Chris Leiphart.

And Costello wasn’t bad last year,
stopping 62 percent of the shots he
saw.

‘‘He watches me and makes sure
that my basic form is right,’’ said
Costello of O’Connell. ‘‘We work on
stepping to the ball and angles. I
guess it’s worked out well, and I’m
greatly appreciative for his help.”

And Costello has not forgotten his
defense.

“{Senior] Dave Farace is playing
great, and so are [junior Robert]
Huke and [sophomore Josh] Levin-
son,’ said Costello. ‘‘And now
{sophomore Kirk] Olsen is healthy
again, so things can only get better.”’

That may be a scary thought for
W&L opponents, but for the Gener-
als, the play will need to keep im-
proving, and fast. The Generals, now
5-1 over all and 3-0 in the ODAC,
take on Gettysburg this Saturday, the

No. 6 ranked team in Division III.

“We match up well position by
position,’’ said Roberts. ‘‘It’s an
evenly matched game, and we beat
them last year, so we feel like we
can win.”’

Stagnitta said the Generals will
need to control the ball offensively
against Gettysburg.

‘Gettysburg is much like us. They
try to mix up defenses, and they ride
similar to us,’’ he said. ‘‘They are
very patient offensively, and they
match-up well with us. We will need
to control the ball offensively more
than we have been.’’

Costello said the team will be
ready.

‘They’ ve beaten some good teams
this year,’” he said. ‘This is a game
we really want to win, and if we win
it will do great things for us. We'll
be ready.’’

 

 

From W&L Sports Information

 

Washington and Lee’s wom-
en’s tennis team won four more
matches last week by identical 9-
0 scores, extending its unbeaten
streak to 11 for the season.

The Generals beat Hollins,
Hope, Catholic and Bridgewater.
Since spring play began, W&L
has won six matches by 9-0
scores,

All together, W&L has lost
just six matches in dual-match
competition this year. Freshman
Mary Nabers has W&L’s best
record at 12-0, while five other
Generals are 11-1, including se-
nior Kathy Leake, whose only
loss this season was to 11-1
teammate Kelly Martone in tour-
nament play this fall.

W&L played at Lynchburg
today, hosts Old Dominion tomor-
row and travels to Mary Washing-
ton for a match on Sunday.

The women’s lacrosse team
came from behind to defeat Guil-
ford, 10-9, in triple overtime. The
Generals trailed 3-2 at halftime
and spotted the Quakers a 6-2
advantage before rallying to force
the extra time.

W&L was led be senior Me-
linda Conkling and sophomore
Lisa Dowling, each of whom had
three goals in the victory.

Dowling got the game winner
30 seconds into sudden death off
an assist from senior Shawn Wert.
Wert had a goal and two assists

_in the game.

Mary Nabers

“That was a really good game
for us in a lot of ways. We sort
of came together all in one
game,’’ said head coach Janine
Hathorn. ‘‘Overall, I’m pleased
with the performance. Everybody
played their roles to the best of
their ability.’’

The Generals played defending
ODAC conference champion
Roanoke today and play at Mary
Washington on Saturday.

W&L’s men’s tennis, the
nation’s 12th-ranked Division III
team, struggled against Division I
competition last week, but showed
plenty of signs of improvement.

Three Generals had three-set
matches in the loss to William
and Mary. W&L’s wins came
against Division III foes Wheaton,
7-2 and Lynchburg, 8-1. Against
Wheaton senior Bill Meadows led

    

the way with a straight-set victory
over nationally ranked Dan Lind-
quist. In their other matches this
week, the Generals lost to James

Madison and Davidson.
This week W&L has matches

with Division I Furman and
Wooster, ranked 15th in Division
Ii.

The women’s track team
thrashed Eastern Mennonite,
Bridgewater and Mary Baldwin in
a meet at Bridgewater last Friday,
while the men placed second to
Bridgewater but easily outdis-
tanced Eastern Mennonite.

The W&L women won eight
of 14 events in the meet. The top
performer for the women was
freshman Wendy Neel, who won
the long jump, 100 meters, 200
meters and ran the leadoff leg in
the winning 4 x 100-meter relay.

The women also got wins
from senior Lisa Jay (discus),
Sandi Dudley (javelin), Sarah
Bolte (high jump) and LaShawn
King (400-meter run).

The men were led by junior
Jim Henry, who won the shot put
with a throw of 44 feet, nine
inches and freshman Scott Covey,
who won the 400-meter run.

‘*Our women were a long way
from full strength because of
nagging injuries, but it was nice
to win,’’ said women’s head
coach John Tucker. ‘‘We still are
a good way off of where we can
be, though.’’

On Saturday, the women and
the men will compete at the Lib-
erty Invitational.
