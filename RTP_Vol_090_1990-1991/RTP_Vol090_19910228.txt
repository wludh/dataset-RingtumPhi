Phase Il finish delayed 5 months

 

By John Foster
Staff Reporter

 

The university has delayed the completion of
the Fraternity Renaissance Program's Phase II by
five months.

‘*We are more convinced than ever that the
premature occupancy of a house under renovation
poses inconveniences to the residents and unac-
ceptable impediments to the overall success of this
program,"’ said Associate Dean of Students Leroy
‘“Buddy’’ Atkins in a Feb. 7 letter to fraternity
members and their parents.

Kappa Sigma, Lambda Chi Alpha and Phi
Kappa Psi, originally scheduled to be finished in
August, will be ready Jan. 3, 1992. Pi Kappa
Phi and Sigma Chi will be completed by Sept. 5,

1992. vie af

Atkins said the university has revised the
renovation schedule to give the construction
company at least an extra 30 days to finish
construction work. The extra time will insure’ that
all furniture is moved in and the houses are
cleaned after construction.

‘Those guys [members of Sigma Alpha Epsilon
and Sigma Nu] didn’t get the full impact’ of
seeing a spotless house, Atkins said,

Phase I of the Renaissance Program is only
slightly behind schedule, Atkins said. Phi Delta
Theta moved in Monday.

Pi Kappa Alpha will be finished on April 13.
The university will not force any PiKA s to occupy
the house for spring term unless at least 10
members want to move in, Atkins said.

Beta Theta Pi and Phi Kappa Sigma could be

completed by April but it is unlikely, Atkins said.
These two houses will be finished by the end of
the summer at the latest.

Delta Tau Delta, Kappa Alpha and Sigma Phi
Epsilon could be finished with Pi Phi and Sigma

Chi in September 1992. Plans for Delt have not.

been completed and KA and SPE have not had
their renovation applications approved.

Because even these revised plans are subject to
change, Atkins urged fraternity members to choose
campus housing if they need housing for less than
an academic year. University housing leases can be
terminated if fraternity members have to move into
their houses earlier than planned, Atkins said.

“Our first concern remains and will always
remain the protection of our students from
academic difficulty and financial burden,’’ Atkins
said.

Washington and Lee senior Tom
Spurgeon on Monday resigned his
position as chairman of the Student
Conduct Committee, one day before
he was found guilty of his second
drunken driving offense in Lexington.

Judge Jo- ;
seph E. Hess
fined Spurgeon Fy
$200, sentenced F
him to two
days in jail and
suspended his
driver’s license
four months.

After the
four months he
will be able to Spurgeon
drive with a restricted license if he
attends the Virginia Alcohol Safety
Action Program.

Charges made at the time of his
arrest on Jan. 19 for reckless driving
and driving with a suspended license
were dismissed.

Spurgeon said he personally re-
signed before the Executive Commit-
tee in a closed session after the EC’s
regular Monday meeting. The com-
mittee voted to unanimously accept
his resignation, according to EC
President Tom Hatcher.

That vote allowed Spurgeon to
continue to serve as a member of the
SCC and president of the senior
class.

A motion by senior EC Rep.
Willard Dumas to remove Surgeon
from the SCC entirely as well as
from his office as class president
failed 6-7, Hatcher said.

Hatcher, Dumas, junior EC Rep.
Caroline Wight, sophomore EC Rep.
Kirk Ogden, third-year law Rep.
Mark Cobb and first-year law Rep.
Daniel Munroe voted to remove Spur-

  

Hatcher said individual students
and EC members can talk about
discussions that led to the closed
vote, but he refused to allow specif-
ics of the debate to be printed.

“There were some harsh feeling
expressed,’ Hatcher said. ‘‘The ill
will that might have been felt doesn’t
need to be public knowledge. The
vote has been taken, the motion
failed and it’s time to move
forward.”’

Spurgeon added that specific SCC
case information, which the student
constitution says is to be held confi-
dential, was discussed during the
debate. The cases were used as exam-
ples of the types of cases the SCC
may face in the future.

Spurgeon said he has made
personal decision to limit his duties
on the SCC. For the rest of the yrur,
he said he will not vote or comment
on cases brought to the committee.

“T just don’t want anybody think-
ing there’s going to be a problem. I
don’t want to be an issue,’’ he saic.

Spurgeon said he will primarily
work on proposed reforms, which
have become urgent since President
Wilson’s decision earlier this month
to overreach what Wilson called inef-
fective student government by sus-
pending three fraternity members for
breaking windows in the recently
renovated Sigma Alpha Epsilon
house.

He will also advise the committee
on procedural matters and help com-
plete paperwork.

Sophomore Richard Burke will
serve as temporary chairman until the
EC selects a permanent replacement
for Spurgeon at their meeting next
Monday. Hatcher said the EC will
consider all class officers currently

The Executive Committee will
send six student body constitution
revisions to the polls March 18,
including one to allow appointment
deliberations behind closed doors.

The Constitutional Revisions Com-
mittee proposed the EC be allowed to

ing to EC President Tom Hatcher,

The EC proposals approved un-
amended include:

« Succession if a Big Three officer

is not enough time for a special

EC Vice President Raymond Wel-

erations last spring, but the EC-elect
decided to close the door. Welder
now admits, he changed his mind.

‘*Having the closed door last year,
some things were said about people’s
abilities that had to be said,’’ Welder
said. ‘‘It would be best if they were
not exposed to the entire campus.”

Welder said he was specifically
persuaded by an argument referring to
the undisputed proposal of executive
session for disciplinary action.

Sophomore EC Rep. Joshua Mac-
Farland said, ‘‘If you go into closed
session for firing, you should go in
for hiring.’

Walter Scott, head of the revisions
committee since Chairman John
Falk’s graduation, called the issue ‘‘a

‘We'd like to see the EC more
open,’’ Scott said, ‘‘but we don’t
want to scare off people or hurt

deliberations.

Third-year law Rep. Mark Cobb
was the sole opponent of the amen-

spirit. He said he opposed the pro-
posal because it was passed too quic-
kly, before the wording was clear.

Scott said there will be a forum
to discuss the proposals at 5 p.m. on
March 12, tentatively set for Lee

W&L students have begun receiving car tax bills,
but don’t seem willing to pay them.

Meanwhile, student leaders are continuing to
investigate ways to dissuade the city from trying to
collect the tax.

Some students returning from Washington Holiday
have found tax bills in their waiting mail. | Others
say their parents received bills during and just before

‘‘He was furious because [the car] was only here
for four months,’’ Conkling said. Virginia law states
that in order for a municipality to tax a vehicle, the
vehicle must be principally garaged or kept in that
municipality for a majority of the year.

Conkling said her father called city officials and
told them the bill amounted to ‘‘taxation without
representation’’ because students are not residents of
the city and do not vote in elections here.

She said officials told her father that students use
roads and police service nine months of the year, so
they should help pay for it.

Recruitment policy angers Law students

 

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

 

The Executive Committee Monday
condemned a Law School faculty policy that
prevents employers who legally discriminate
against homosexuals from using the Law
School’s placement facilities.

The Law School discrimination policy
excludes employers that discriminate on basis of
‘*sex, age, race, religion, national origin, hand-
icap or disability’’ from using the career place-
ment facilities.

The law faculty in closed-door session on
Feb, 11 amended that policy, adding ‘‘sexual
orientation, or any other legally impermissible
or irrelevant ground’’ as criteria opposed by the
school.

The EC Monday unanimously passed a
resolution, written by third-year law EC Rep.
Mark Cobb, that condemns the policy and asks
for reconsideration.

The EC resolution says the faculty policy
would bar from recruiting at the Law School
the ‘‘Armed Forces and certain intelligence
agencies’’ that ‘‘comply with all federal and
Virginia laws involving discrimination.”’

Senior EC Reps. John Fialcowitz and
Willard Dumas Tuesday withdrew their support
for the EC resolution. Both said they needed
more time to investigate the issue.

Michael Carlson, ’92L, led an effort to
circulate a petition at the Law School calling
for the faculty to reconsider their proposal. He
told the EC Monday that the petition was
signed by about 60 percent of the law students
when he stopped collecting signatures.

EC President-elect and second-year law Rep.
Giles Perkins said the law faculty should not
decide ‘‘who I can interview with and who |
can’t.

‘Discrimination is horrible, but the only
way we can define it is how the law defines
it,’ he said. ‘To step out of that becomes
vague.”’

The law faculty adopted the policy in
response to a regulation passed by the
Association of American Law Schools, with
which W&L is accredited.

The AALS regulation calls on member
schools to observe AALS bylaws by denying
use of their placement facilities to organizations
that discriminate on a number ol
identical to those of the amended W&L policy.

Law School Dean Randall Bezanson said
accreditation with the AALS was one issue in

grounds,

law faculty debate on the policy. He said the
faculty also discussed:
+ Sexual preference relative to ability as a

lawyer.

* Other Law School policies, such as
admissions, which do not consider sexual
preference.

+ Impact on employers.
* The school’s right to impose restrictions on
which employers can use placement facilities.
Bezanson, who chairs law faculty meetings,
would not identify professors for or against the
policy change. Law Prof. Timothy Philipps,
however, put his dissent on record.
In a memo to faculty, Philipps said the
policy ‘‘has caused more divisiveness and hard
feelings here than any issue in recent memory,’’

Best minds

The voices and thoughts of seven students at
Vanderbilt University reached out from Nashville,
Tennessee to Washington, D.C. and then throughout the
nation in a recent Washington Post article focusing on
their lives and their thoughts during this time of war.
However admirable this may sound, the young men will
undoubtedly find it difficult to face readers they may
know. In their comments on serving in the armed
forces, it was shockingly clear that despite all the
wonderful opportunities these men had for the best of
educations and lifestyles, they had not grasped the most
basic lessons of responsibility and fairness.

Perhaps most disturbing and severely specific, yet
reflective of the tone of much of the thinking relayed
in the story, was the attitude of one student toward the
draft. He told the Post ‘‘This might sound selfish, but I
think it would be a shame to put America’s best young
minds on the front line. If we have to go, we have to
go, but I think it would be a shame.’’ He was right. He
does sound selfish. Selfish, irresponsible, arrogant and
uninformed.

There is no basis for his supposition that his mind or
those of his classmates are the best. Perhaps they are
best in terms of opportunities offered or in terms of
wealth they live with. But certainly the minds and lives
of their counterparts from the other side of the railroad
tracks are equal to theirs. Such a basic concept, but one
they missed despite their ‘‘privileged’’ upbringing.

What is important for the readers of the Post to note
is that the thoughts of these men are not representative
of all students at Vanderbilt or those across the nation.
Readers must realize that only seven young men at a
school sought by the privileged were interviewed. There
are a number of college students who could have much
more thoughtfully and maturely responded to the
reporter’s questions, opposed to or in favor of the war.
It is regretful that the reporter turned to ‘‘America’s
best young minds’’ at Vanderbilt.

Paper changes

In this issue of The Ring-tum Phi, we bring to our
readers several changes. First, and most importantly,
Andrew Waters has replaced Brian Root as one of the
editors-in-chief. Working as associate editor for almost
a year and as a senior majoring in journalism, Andrew
is well prepared for his new job. Brian could not return
to school after the Washington Holiday for health
reasons.

A more minor but probably more immediately
noticeable change involves our headline style. The
heads are now darker and bolder. We hope you find
them easier to read and we welcome your comments.

Finally, we have twice this semester suspended the
W&Life features pages because of unusual
circumstances, more recent of which is our 20-page
Fancy Dress supplement in this week’s issue. This is
not the start of a trend. W&Life will continue to appear
faithfully each week.

Quote of the Week

“We started collecting hazardous duty pay, $110.00 a
month in Saudi. Wow, I’m rolling in the big bucks. Just
kidding, the actual reward I hope to get is bringing
everyone in my platoon home in one piece with sound
minds,”

— W&L Alumni John Legters ’89, now a second
lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corp in a letter to a
student here mailed from his camp in Saudi Arabia. Or
by now possibly Kuwait or Baghdad, Iraq.

MY VIEW

You are in the grip of the devil. I am in the
grip of the devil. We’re all in the grip of the devil.
Yes, friends, Satan has been inside of us ever since
Adam and Eve ate forbidden fruit in the Garden
of Eden. Yes, friends, they plucked that fruit right
off that holy tree in disobedience to the Lord Our
Father and ever since we have been sinful creatures
of Satan. Until one day the good Lord took pity on
us and sent down his son, the Lord Jesus Christ,
friends, to take away our sin and....

Oh, pardon me, readers. You see, I’ve been
doing some freelance work writing Sunday morning
radio sermons and it’s tough getting back in the
habit of irresponsible journalism. I apologize for
my long absence from the editorial page, but I felt
a little guilty writing about naked housewives and
related subjects when the country is involved in a
major armed conflict in the Middle East. I have
also been hampered by a nagging case of halitosis.

The main reason I’ve decided to end my hiatus
from the editorial page is that since I quit writing,
people have started accepting me socially and I
find that intolerable. I’ve also been itching to say
something about the ridiculous rise in the price of
beer. Due to new federal taxes, it is now cheaper
to buy diamond jewelry than a case of Budweiser.

Obviously, the federal government has forgotten

what happened when King George III (or was it '

King Richard the Lion Heart) tried to raise beer
taxes in the American colonies. The colonial beer-
drinkers became patriot rebels and decided to

Clarification on
Christian West

Although I share Ms. Taylor’s distaste for
the style and tone of the Spectator [My View:
Christian West Is Not Perfect, Feb. 14], I am
afraid that I must point out that a number of
her ‘‘facts’’ condemning the shortcomings of
the Christian West are misleading. I shall
attempt to do this in a parallel form.

CLARIFICATION: St. Augustine of Hippo
was not a hypocrite, at least not because of
Ms. Taylor’s evidence. Yes, Augustine did
father an illegitimate child, and, yes, he did
extol the virtues of ‘‘foregoing the pleasures of
the flesh;’’ however, Augustine’s unfortunate
offspring appeared before his famed conversion
to Christianity, while his praise of chastity
came, of course, thereafter.

CLARIFICATION: I do not profess to
know how Ms. Taylor uses the phrase ‘‘c-
ondemned as heretics,’’ but surely she is
incorrect in making her list. Thomas Aquinas
may have been disliked by contemporary
popes — but he was never condemned as a
heretic by the Church. He died a Dominican
friar and was given a proper Christian burial,
never to be excommunicated and certainly
never burned at the stake.

CLARIFICATION: ‘‘Suspicious’’ men were
also executed in Salem, not just women.

CLARIFICATION: To my _ knowledge
Catholics were not exterminated under Hitler
for being Catholic. In fact, his staunchest
supporter were the Bavarians, known for their
ultra-orthodox Catholicism. Those admirable
Catholics, both religious and lay, who died
under Hitler’s persecution, did so because they
had the moral fortitude to stand up for what
their religion taught them, and I expect that
just as many Protestants were ‘‘exterminated’’
for the same reason.

CLARIFICATION: Yes, there are many
more rapes in our country than in Saudi
Arabia. But we should remember that it was
only a few years back when a princess in that
country and her lover were beheaded for the
crime of fornication. That scems to me to be
a high price to pay for respect that women
surely deserve.

1 do not wish to argue against Ms. Taylor
that the West is perfect in any sense of that
word. I do not, however, believe that this
argument is defended in many circles (Perhaps
it is in the Spectator; | don’t bother reading it
anymore). I might mention that I did not read
Mr. Humphries’ articles on Multiculturalism;
nevertheless, I do have a recommendation for
Ms. Taylor and others who would appreciate
an intelligent discussion touching on some of
the inherent dangers in certain approaches to

protest the beer tax by dressing up like Indians and
dumping something into the Boston Harbor. The
beer-drinking patriots congregated on the Boston
Harbor docks as planned, but no one could decide
what should be thrown in the water.

Ben Franklin’s girlfriend suggested that they
throw their beer into the harbor and the patriots
replied by pushing her into the water. The day was
finally saved when Patrick Henry rode onto the
dock with an idea and a saddle bag full of Liberty
Beer 12-packs.

"I’ve got an idea," he said. "Why don’t we
drink the beer and throw tea into the harbor. Give
me beer or give me death."

All of the patriots cheered except for Thomas
Jefferson who had paid the security deposit on the
dock and wanted Patrick’s horse to get off it.

So the patriots got drunk and dumped the tea
into the harbor. You don’t really believe that the
patriots dumped tea into the harbor to protest tea
taxes, do you? That’s just a vicious rumor
propogated by American high school teachers.

When the British government reacted to the
Boston Harbor protest by banning the consumption
of alcohol during political demonstrations, the beer-
drinking patriots raised an army and declared war.
And the rest is history. Consequently, if it weren’t
for beer, America would probably still be a British
colony.

The framers of the Constitution intended to put
something in the First Amendment. about beer:
("Congress shall make no aw respecting. an
establishment of religion ... or abridging the right
to petition for redress fo grievances or the right to
drink beer at reasonable prices.") Unfortunately,

Wilson’s motives
absolutely sound

I am writing in response to the Phi’s exten-
sive coverage of the bottle throwing/window
breaking incident which culminated in Presi-
dent Wilson’s decision to suspend three stu-
dents for the remainder of the winter term.

While an undergraduate in the carly 70s, I
served two terms as president of Phi Kap. My
experiences in the fraternity system were
among the most important I had at W&L.
After graduation in 1974, I worked for two
years and came back to law school. I ate all
of my meals at Phi Kap and remained in very
close contact with many undergraduates.
During my third year of law school, | served
as president of the student body and | was
honored to receive the Gilliam Award in 1979.
As a member of the Alumni board and the Phi
Kap house corporation board, I am on campus
at least twice each year.

Most important for the purposes of this
letter, | yield to no one in my love for and
support of the fraternity system at Washington
and Lee. I enjoyed fraternity life as much as
anyone during my years in Lexington, so your
readers need not fear that this letter is coming
from a milk and cookies type.

I respectfully suggest that current students
are overlooking very important and broader
issues if they characterize this case as an iso-
lated or ‘‘routine’’ incident of window break-
age. Literally speaking, that’s all it was, but
the vehement criticism President Wilson is
receiving ignores that unique nature and timing
of this particular event and the climate in
which President Wilson’s decision was made.

John Wilson has been criticized strongly by
some for giving fraternities at Washington and
Lee their last, great chance to flourish under
the renaissance plan. Many other schools
across the country have given up on their
fraternities in one fashion or another, yielding
to pressure over destruction of property, exces-
sive drinking and other examples of miscon-
duct which have taken place on those cam-
puses and on ours, Bucking that national trend,
President Wilson has essentially placed a
$15,000,000 bet on the current generation of
fraternity members. He is willing to go the

extra, very costly mile to save fraternities.

difficult to see how President Wilson would
react angrily to misconduct which threatens
serious injuries and which is unquestionably
prohibited under the renaissance standards, yet
which neither the chapters involved, the IFC
nor the SCC chose to handle. From the articles
in the February 7 Phi, it appears that the
response of the fraternities was, in effect: ‘‘We
made them put the windows back in and we’re
not going to tell you who was involved.’’

I do not fault President Wilson one iota for
being furious with that sort of arrogant
response, which suggested that there was no
need for any real punishment. Who among you
would remain silent if you thought a $15
million investment in which you were a key
partner was in jeopardy in its early stages?

President Wilson acted a bit hastily, Also
implicit in many student comments is the
notion that he acted without warning to the
appropriate student entities. However, I can
imagine accusations of “‘meddling’’ in student
affairs had he suggested to any of the respon-
sible bodies that the administration expected
them to deal with this incident quickly and
forcefully.

one of our most honored traditions. However,
we must remember that this authority is dele
gated to the students by the Board of Trustees,
faculty and administration. It has worked for
sO many years because students have honored
that trust and there have been few instances
when the administration has felt it had no
choice but to intervene.

the IFC had moved quickly to punish these
three men very forcefully (perhaps short of a
full term suspension), so that this incident
would not have occurred, Had they done so, I
am sure President Wilson would not have
acted as he did. However, if this entire matter
serves as a loud wake-up call to student lead-
ers to ‘‘use it or lose it’’ by doing whatever is
necessary to preserve the spirit and letter of
the renaissance program, then it will have been
an unfortunate but invaluable lesson. If not,
this generation of students may well witness
the demise of fraternities and, right or wrong,
be blamed for it.

nities and for W&L’s other great traditions, |
hope that the former will occur. Meanwhile, let
us not be too quick to criticize President
Wilson by failing to understand that his mo-
tives were absolutely sound.

Sincerely,
Waller T. Dudley, ’74, ’79L

  

 
 
 

 

Amendment after learning that it was “nickel draft

beer" night at the bar across the street. When they
reconvened the next moming, the framers were too
hung-over to think about beer and decided to re-
write the preamble instead.

If you’re still not convinced that heavy beer
taxes are unacceptable, consider the facts in a
recent Associated Press article. According to an
anthropologist at the University of Pennsylvania,
beer is the "cornerstone" of civilization because
“ancient man turned from hunting to farming to
raise grain for beer." One of the earliest known
clay tablets, which dates back to 1800 B.C. is a

If the government needs to raise money, they

My point is that the beer drinkers of the
country must unite and protest this unconstitutional
and immoral tax of mankind’s most sacred

someone should organize a demonstration at the

W&L cancels programs
planned for spring term

 

By Chris Simon
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee administra-
tors canceled European spring term
programs in response to the Persian
Gulf War and the subsequent danger
to Americans traveling abroad.

Associate Dean Laurant Boetsch
said the University has been moni-
toring State Department Western
European travel advisories, as well as
the withdrawal of other programs
currently traveling in foreign coun-
tries. Boetsch said a Syracuse Univer-
sity group has already returned from
Florence, Italy.

“This decision was made only
after careful consideration of all the
facts available to us,’’ said Boetsch
in a letter to students and faculty.

*‘{It] is based primarily on the likely
increased threat to Americans travel-
ing to, within, or from European
countries which are a part of the
coalition forces in the Mideast.’’

Included among the canceled
programs were trips to Spain, Germa-
ny, England and Leningrad, U.S.S.R.

The last time the University can-
celed spring term programs was in
1986, after United States bombers
attacked Libya ten days before spring
term.
Boetsch said University officials
wanted to make their final decision
before spring term registration so
faculty and students could make
alternate academic plans.

‘‘We already ask [students and
faculty] to take on enormous risks,”’
said Boetsch. ‘‘This was just too
much to ask.”’

For that reason, said Philipps, he proposed the faculty
amend the policy to specify that the school ‘‘opposes

unlawful discrimination.”’

Among other advantages, Philipps said his compromise
makes ‘‘an honest attempt’’ to comply with AALS by-
laws but allows lawfully discriminating employers back on

campus.

Though Carlson said the policy could keep the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and Central Intelligence Agency
from recruiting at the Law School, spokesmen for both

organizations disagreed.

FBI Personnel Staffing Specialist Gwen Hubbard and
CIA Spokesman Ceferino Epps both said that the AALS
policy does not affect their agencies, as they do not

discriminate.

Epps said the CIA has determined heterosexuals ‘‘may
be vulnerable to outside pressures just as homosexuals.”
He added that national origin is lawfully taken into
account as a security issue only for non-U.S. citizens.

implementation of AALS policy has kept the Army’s

Allison Polchek _ said

law campuses nationwide, but students from those schools
still apply individually.
Polchek said the military lawfully discriminates on

grounds of age, handicap and sexual preference for active

or internships.

duty officers, but not for the Civilian Attorney Program

The reason for discrimination in the active JAG,

according to Polchek, is that JAG officers must be able

to do the same job as any officer, including combat duty.
Military regulations state that homosexuals are not
permitted in combat.

Carlson said accreditation is probably not at risk if the

session Monday.

AALS policy is not adopted, because too many other

has open
selection

From the W&L News Office

 

 

For the first time, Kathekon,
Washington and Lee’s student-alum-
ni service group, is accepting appli-
cations for membership from rising
juniors and seniors.

According to Kathekon President
Bob Fuller, in previous years new
members were selected by students
already involved in Kathekon, so
there was no way for students to
express interest in and apply for
membership.

“We are at a point in our evolu-
tion where we feel like we need to
open up the application process to
involve upperclass students from the
entire university community and be
truly representative of the student
body,’’ Fuller said.

Kathekon, founded in 1984, cur-
rently has 22 members and is a cre-
ation of the Alumni Office and the
Alumni Board of Directors.

Fuller said Kathekon’s purpose
is to recognize undergraduates and
law students as alumni-in-residence
and therefore involve them with the
Alumni Association and its work on
behalf of the university.

Kathekon’s activities include
serving as hosts and hostesses for
the Freshman Orientation Barbecue,
helping with Board of Trustees
meetings, and meeting with the
Alumni Board of Directors.

Applications and an interview
sign-up sheet are available outside
Carol Calkins’ office in the Univer-
sity Center. The final day to apply
is March 7.

Beating the Lexington tax bandit

 

MY VIEW
By John Stump

 

Before leaving Lexington for
Washington holiday, I decided to give
dear old dad a call. Of course I
wanted to talk to him, but there was
also the important issue of funds. As
usual, I was running low. Much to
my chagrin however, earlier that day
someone else from Lexington had
come tugging at the purse strings:
none other than the Lexington
Commissioner of the Revenue. Dad
informed me that he had just received
a letter requesting the first of two
installments towards the dreaded car
tax. Apparently, R.D. Clark, the new
meter-maid/ dog catcher/bicycle safety
inspector had not handed out enough
tickets this year to give the aspiring
New York of south west Virginia
enough revenue to keep the city
council’s pockets full.

We both know the car tax scam is

on the high cost of living in
Lexington and the hair brained

by J.R. Smith

 

schemes of the locals to suck every
possible penny out of W&L wasn’t
going to help my case. I tried to
change the subject, but to no avail. I
cringed to hear the contents of the
letter; they wanted their first
payment, one hundred © and _ thirty
bucks. "I say we don’t pay it!" I
said. "Of course we’re not going to
pay it son, we already pay personal
property tax in Northern Virginia!" he
said, somewhat troubled that I would
even consider something so asinine. “
But dad, don’t they have a legal right
to the tax, it says something here
about..." I was stopped dead in my
tracks. "  Hogwash!" came __ the
response. "Your car is principally
garaged in Fairfax county, that’s
where we pay tax on it, that’s where
its listed on the insurance, and we
don’t need to confuse matters by
getting into a big Car Tax hoo-hah
with the city of Lexington!" Dad
went on to explain that anyone whose
car is not principally garaged in
Lexington is not subject to the car
tax.

Now, just what does "principally
garaged" mean? Well, I don’t really
know, and today when I asked the
Commissioner of the Revenue, she

Interviews and photos

confessed that she didn’t know either.
After some calculation, we
determined that my car is not
principally garaged in Lexington, I
signed a statement to that effect, and
she agreed to leave me alone. The
tax bandits had been beaten, and they
knew it.

As everyone else will soon be
getting a similar bill, and presumably
will be no more excited than I was
about paying it, let me offer the
following suggestions so that we can
all beat the car tax bandits together.
First, if you live outside the city
limits, you’re exempt from Lexington
city tax, so go down to city hall and
sign your statement of exemption.
Second, for those who live inside the

_city limits, as I do, you need to do a

few calculations. The commissioner
and I agreed that six months is a
nice round figure for "principally
garaged". Well, lets see... We have
three months of summer vacation,
about a month of Christmas break, 10
days for Washington holiday, 10 days
for spring break, 10 days for
Thanksgiving, and many of us go
away for weekends, and often leave
our cars at home, or parked outside
of the city for extended periods of

time. Surely, even if it means
swapping cars with mom or simply
parking outside of the city limits, we
can all find a way to keep our cars
from falling under the rough
“principally garaged" guidelines laid
out here. Third, don’t be intimidated
by thugish threats implying that
anyone who has signed a one year
lease in Lexington has to pay the tax
because they therefore must also keep
their car in Lexington. This is a
colossal non-sequitur, but not atypical
of bureaucratic tom foolery in and
about Lexington. So why worry
about a boycott of city businesses?
Why send your car home? Why deal
with the hassles of meddling petty
bureaucrats? Head on down to City
Hall and sign your statement of
exemption, let the burden of proof be
on the city. If you sign the statement
saying that your car is not principally
garaged in Lexington, they will have
to prove that it is in order to get
their tax, and we are all energetic and
creative enough to keep our cars out
of Lexington long enough to qualify
for the exemption. So let’s all beat
the tax bandits together, and wait
patiently for their next intrusive

revenue raising scam.

ACLU chapter
organizes here

By Sarah Drain
Staff Reporter

 

A chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has
been formed at Washington and Lee.

To become a ‘‘card carrying ACLU member’’ at
W&L, a $5 annual due is required to the national ACLU.
Freshman Andrew Schneider, founder of W&L’s chapter,
is currently organizing political speakers and events.

On March 18, W&L alumnus Bruce Kramer, who is
the director of the Tennessee ACLU, will be speak on
campus. The speech will be open to all students.

Schneider said he also hopes to have a symbolic open
mike forum to remind people of the importance of the
right to freedom of speech. In addition, Schneider plans
to publicize the bicentennial of the Bill of Rights by
organizing a celebration, including speakers and
discussions.

According to Schneider, the response has been
‘‘surprisingly terrific.” More than eighty people, most-

ly freshmen, have paid the $5 required due.
The next ACLU meeting will be March 5 at 6:30 p.m.

Hatcher also said he wants to

they could be used as a bargaining
chip.

Other possibilities include asking

The Ring-tum Phi, February 28, 1991

Things aren’t always as bad as
they seem.

Witness Washington and Lee’s
19-5 loss to Virginia in the 1991
season opener in men’s lacrosse Wed-
nesday.

Virginia is ranked No. 3 in Divi-
sion I, and according to W&L head
coach Jim Stagnitta, they may be
even better than that.

“They are the best team I’ve seen
since the Pennsylvania team I played
on lost to Syracuse in the Final Four
in 1984,’’ he said. ‘‘What do you do
against a team like that? We won't
see anything else like that the rest of
the year.”’

Virginia jumped out to a 7-0 lead
with seven different players scoring
goals before W&L got on the board.
Senior Todd Garliss scored on an
extra-man situation, and senior Clark
Wight scored off a feed from senior
Mike Moseman 31 seconds later,
closing the gap to 7-2 with 8:25 left
in the first half.

Rich Florin scored for the Cava-
liers with just six seconds left in the
half to break some W&L momentum
and start the Cavaliers on a run that
would put the game away. Virginia

scored nine unanswered goals to take
a 16-2 lead before junior Jeff Roberts
could get W&L back in the scoring
column in the fourth quarter.

‘The goal they got at the end of
the first half was the one that really
killed us,’’ said Stagnitta.

Sophomore John Hunter scored
off a feed from classmate David
Schiminger and Wight scored seven
seconds from the end to make the
final score 19-5, and all in all, Stag-
nitta was pleased.

““We played well,’’ he said. ‘‘I
was disappointed in some aspects of
the game. We’re just one pass away
right now. We didn’t finish well
when we had opportunities, but we
had some guys play really well.

“John Hunter and Clark Wight
ran by whoever was guarding them
whenever they wanted to. [Senior]
Tom Costello was solid in goal, and
{junior} Jeff O’Brien and [senior]
Mike Pardo played well defensively.”’

Costello made 13 saves on the
day, but saw 55 shots. Virginia’s
defense held W&L without a goal for
the first 21 minutes of the game, and
then for 28 minutes until Roberts’
goal in the fourth quarter. W&L got
off only 15 shots, but still, Stagnitta
is not concerned.

‘‘We ran up and down the field,
hit them and played with them at

think big despite loss

times,’’ he said, ‘‘and they are a
good, good team.’’

The Division I opponent gets the
Generals ready for the Division III
portion of the schedule, which begins
Mar. 6 against Randolph-Macon at 3
p-m. on Wilson Field, and Stagnitta
can’t wait.

“I wish we were playing again
Saturday,’’ he said. ‘‘I have a feeling
that our guys are going to take the
field against Randolph-Macon and
dominate. I’m looking forward to the
Division III portion of the schedule.
We're better right now than we were
last year at this time. We will be a
good team.”’

W&L will be able to be more
aggressive in games against Division
III opponents.

“‘We can go after teams on the D-
III level,’’ Stagnitta said, ‘‘and we
will. We had to play differently to
stay in the game with Virginia, but
against D-III opponents, we can at-
tack them.’’

Stagnitta sees his team as being a
Top 10 team. W&L is ranked 13th in
the first Division III Poll.

“We'll be able to play in the top
10,’’ he said. ‘‘Maybe not the top
five, but we'll be in the top seven or
eight. We are ready for anything
Division III has to offer.’’

Women’s indoor track wins mythical ODAC title

 

By John Laney
Associate Sports Editor

 

Led by freshman Wendy Neel, the
Washington and Lee women’s indoor
track team won their second straight
unofficial Old Dominion Athletic
Conference championship on Saturday
at Wake Fieldhouse in Lynchburg,
while the men’s team finished second
to Lynchburg.

‘‘We performed tremendously
well,’’ said women’s coach John
Tucker. ‘‘We were cleary the domin-
ate team.”’

W&L scored 195 points. Second-
place Lynchburg had 56.

Neel, the high scorer for the wo-
men, accounted for 22.5 of W&L’s
points by setting a school record in

the 60-yard dash, winning the long

   
 
 
 

 

jump and running the first leg of the
Generals’ first-place 440-yard relay
team.

‘She had an excellent day,’’
Tucker said. ‘‘But everyone who
competed for us scored points.”’

Neel was followed by classmate
Kristen Moore, who placed second in
the one-mile run, second in the 800-
yard run and was on W&L’s first-
place two-mile relay team.

Junior Shawn King won the 440-
yard run and ran on the first-place
one-mile and 440-yard relay teams.

“She may have been our high-
point scorer if she had not been
disqualified in the finals of the 60-
yard dash,’’ Tucker said. ‘‘It was a
very questionable call. She didn’t
jump out of the blocks, she was jus!
shifting her weight on her hands.”’

while Brown was second in the 60-

ran into a Lynchburg team that was
really good.”’

In a final blaze of glory, the
Washington and Lee men’s and
women’s swim teams finished their
season with a handful of victories.

Not only did both teams win their
last dual meets at Radford, 124-61
for the men and 114-90 for the
women, led by sophomore Claire
Dudley went on to capture their
fourth consecutive Old Dominion
Athletic Conference Championship as
well the Atlantic States Championship
at the combined ODAC/ASC meet
last weekend.

The lady Generals won 19 of the
20 events giving them a 117-point
margin of victory for the ODAC title
and a 159-point margin in the ASC
title, They are the first team to win
four consecutive ODAC team titles in
the league’s history.

While leading her team to victory
Dudley was named the Atlantic States
Swimmer of the Year. She also estab-
lished a new school record with her
victory in the 200-yard individual
medley and also won the 100- and
200-yard breaststroke races.

The men placed second at the
meet, but junior Doug Brown cap-
tured the spotlight by being named
the ASC Swimmer of the Meet, qual-
ifying for the Division III nationals in
the 1650-yard freestyle. Brown also
won the 500-yard freestyle and placed
second in the 200-yard freestyle.

Head coach Page Remillard said
that he was thrilled with the perform-
ance of his swimmers.

“This is exactly what we were
looking for. It is really a nice way to
end the season. We went up against
some tough teams at the beginning
of our schedule but as the season
progressed our meets became more
and more competitive,’ he said.

“Doug also swam a really great
race in the 1650. He did not have the
times going into the meet to indicate
that he had national potential. He
really took some people by surprise.’’

Generals look to improve in 1991

 

From W&L Sports Information

Washington and Lee head baseball
coach Jeff Stickley says his team
needs to improve in three areas this
year to have a better season and
compete in the Old Dominion Athlet-
ic Conference: hitting, fielding and
pitching.

“‘l expect we might be a little bit
better,’’ says W&L’s fifth-year leader.
‘‘Most of the young guys got a lot of
experience last year. Of course, I
don’t know whether it was good
experience or bad experience, but it
was experience,”’

Stickley’s tongue-in-cheek analysis
is a little more revealing than a first
glance might indicate. Eight of his
top ten hitters from last year are
expected to return for this season. A
full stock of infielders and outfielders
are back, and a proven catcher re-
turns behind the plate.

And to top it all off, Steve
Momorella, the ace of the pitching
staff, is back for his third season.

Eleven lettermen return to the
roster in 1991, and Stickley has a
host of proven players to build his
team around. Seniors Tim Wheeler
and T.J. Daly are both clutch per-
formers who can help the Generals
with the bat and the glove. And
Daly, who started all 20 games, was
second on the team in starts as a
pitcher with five.

Other veterans like Brian Harper
in the outfield, J.T. Swartz at third
base, and Chris Kavanagh at catcher

give Stickley solid experience at
every area of the field.

Heightening Stickley’s concern is
the Generals’ dearth of pitching.
You've heard of ‘‘Spahn and Sain
and two days of rain?’’ Well, W&L’s
refrain isn’t even that cheery. It’s
more like ‘‘Momorella, and well,
uhhh....’’

True, Momorella is about as good
as they come. The junior was a first-
team All-ODAC selection despite his
2-5 record and his 63 strikeouts and
nine starts nearly doubled any other
W&L pitcher’s numbers last year.
Daly and junior Toby McCoy are the
only other returning hurlers.

The Generals look to be steady
everywhere else on the field. Kav-
anagh will be starting his second full-
time season behind the plate, and
Stickley says the senior who led the
team in hits should be ready for his
best year yet. In the infield, Swartz
and Daly will alternate between first
base, third base and designated hitter,
while sophomores Jon Hesse and
Mike Steinbrook should shore up the
middle infield.

Stickley likes his outfield, and it
all should start with centerfielder
Brian Harper, who in addition to his
error-free play last season is W&L’s
top base-stealing threat. Joining Harp-
er in the outfield are familiar faces

like Fred Renneker, Tim Wheeler and defensively,’’ Stickley said. ‘‘It’s a

Ron Katz, all of whom are potential
designated hitters, too.
“T think if we can find a third-

baseman, we'll be a pretty good team

““We will need to get some help

advantage of our opportunities when
they come up, we’ll be all right.’’
