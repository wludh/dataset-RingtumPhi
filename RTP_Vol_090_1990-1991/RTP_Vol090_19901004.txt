, Alisann McGloin received the first-

ever Todd C. Smith Memorial Fel-

lowship in Northen Auditorium Tues-
day night.

, The award, which is named for

Todd Smith, a 1983 graduate of

W&L, will allow McGloin to spend

Spring Term in Moscow while work-

ing on a series of articles for The

Tampa (Fla.) Tribune. Her work will

center on the role of Soviet women

. in the age of perestroika in that

country.

Smith was killed in November of
last year by terrorists in the Huallaga
Valley of Peru while researching a
story on the drug trade in that area.
Earlier in his career, Smith accompa-
nied the Nicaraguan contras for a
month and produced a series of arti-
, cles on their fight against the Sandan-

ista government.

2 At the time of his death, Smith

, Was taking as vacation from his job

at the Tribune to write about the

Peruvian drug trade.

, The award was presented by Rob-
ert P. Smith, Todd’s father and 1954

graduate of W&L.

‘ “It is a moral necessity to put
one foot in front of the other along
the right path, to see what is actually

, out there,’’ Smith said. ‘‘We are

telling Alisann to put her foot out

there, to keep her eye on the horizon.

, You never know what you might find

out there.”’

‘Todd was a fortunate young
/ man,”’ said Dean of the College John
Elrod in his introductory speech. ‘He
was a diligent and dedicated student,
, possessing what I call a restless intel-
ligence.”’

Duwel said that Associate Dean of Students Leroy

already made plans to attend.

Assistant Director of Athletics Cinda Rankin said that
the Athletic Department is ‘‘very cautious’’ to schedule

said they had already booked bands.

Duwell told the IFC there will be an open

“If you want to say your peace, this is the
time to do it,’’ she said.

IFC President Goodloe Lewis announced that
the week of Oct. 15 has been designated Alcohol
Awareness Week on campus and that fraternities
should plan activities to support the project.

‘The impression on this campus of fraternities
is of an alcohol horn of plenty,’’ he said.

He noted that will be a speaker in Lee Chapel
one evening during the week and a battle of the
bands in the Student Activities Pavilion on Friday
the 19th. He urged all fraternity members to attend
both events.

‘*Send your pledges to the speaker, support the
battle of the bands, have alcohol-free parties that

Assistant Dean of Students for greek affairs

Lewis also told the council that residents of
Rockbridge County have been complaining that
fraternity activities at country houses were bother-
ing the neighbors.

‘‘There have been complaints that some people
are shooting all day long, ’’ he said.

He said now that Rush is over, that should not
be a problem any longer, but he urged fraternity
leaders to ‘‘encourage these people to limit their
shooting to one hour a day.”’

Lewis said he was just trying to get fraternities
to keep things under control, not trying to stop
people from partying in the country.

‘*Actually,’’ he said, ‘‘the way the school’s

A Lexington police officer was
arrested Saturday night and charged
with the murder his wife in their
Lexington home.

Officer Jerry Richard Knick, 33,
was charged with first degree murder
and the use of a firearm in the
commission of a felony. He was
arrested about 10:25 Saturday night
for allegedly shooting his 34-year-old
wife, Lisa Vincent Knick, in the head
in their Lexington house on Battery
Lane.

A preliminary hearing is set for
October 22 in the Rockbridge County
Juvenile and Domestic Relations
Court

Lexington Police Chief Bruce
Beard said in a statement that Knick

was on duty at the time of the
shooting. Officials say Knick called
the police dispatcher after the shoot-
ing and waited outside his home.
Police arrived shortly after 10:30 p.m.
and Knick turned over his 9 mm
service revolver, which had been fired
once,

Lisa Knick, who was found lying
on the living room floor, was flown
by helicopter from Stonewall Jackson
Hospital to Roanoke Memorial Hospi-
tal where she died between 9 and 10
a.m. Sunday morning, police said.
Hospital officials said she was shot
once in her left temple.

The investigation has been turned
over to the Bureau of Criminal Inves-
tigation of the Virginia State Police.
State Police Sgt. Cecil Handy, who is
in charge of the investigation, said
the shooting was the result of a
domestic dispute. In his statement,

Chief Beard said Knick has been put
on administrative leave without pay
until the case is resolved.

Knick was held in the Rockbridge
County Jail over the weekend without
bond. He was released Monday on
$60,000 bond after an a arraignment
hearing.

Culpepper awarded custody of
Knick’s two children from his current
marriage to a relative in Northern
Virginia. The children were asleep in
the house at the time of the shooting,
police said. Knick has two other chil-
dren from a previous marriage.

Officer Knick is a native of

Students oppose
BV cogen plant

 

By Jason Kelley
Senior Copy Editor

The cogeneration plant hearing in
Buena Vista two weeks ago and the
ongoing fight over possible approval
of the plant’s construction has Buena
Vista residents, and a few Washing-
ton and Lee students, up in arms.

Members. of the Outing Club’s
Environmental section have been
actively opposing the plant, a coal-
burning electrical generator that oppo-
nents say will pollute the valley.

‘tA few of my friends and I have
been going to all the meetings in BV
and doing mailings to senators and
anyone else who could help,’”” W&L
senior Hal Bailey said.

The Buena Vista City Council
voted two years ago to re-zone a
farm to allow Hadson Development
Corporation to build a cogeneration
plant to produce electricity for Vir-
ginia Power.

Bailey said he, along with other
members of the Outing Club, has
been circulating petitions and writing
letters opposing construction of the
plant since last spring.

He said the Buena Vista area has
weather patterns that trap pollution in
the small valley areas of the Blue
Ridge mountains.

He quoted statistics that estimate
40 percent of the year the area ex-
pericnces air movements called ther-
mal conversions. The resulting differ-
ences in air temperatures in the val-
leys are what create morning fog, and
can also stop air pollutants from
being swept away over the Blue
Ridge by the prevailing westerly
winds.

Bailcy said doctors have warned
that if the plant is built, the city can
expect to see increases in the rate of
respiratory ailments, especially among
the elderly and those already afflicted
with allergies and asthma.

At the Sept. 17 hearing before the
Buena Vista City Council and the
City Planning Commission, BV city
manager Clay Goodman read _ his
report that estimates 200 construction

jobs and 27 permanent jobs would be
created by the plant. He said the
plant could generate up to $515,000
annually in taxes, more than 8 per-
cent of the city’s total revenue intake.

Hadson Development Vice-Presi-
dent Robert P. Kennel said construc-
tion of the plant allows Georgia
Bonded Fibers, a paper producer in
Buena Vista, to shut down its ‘‘dirty
old boilers’’ and purchase steam from
Hadson’s new plant.

He said this would allow Georgia
Bonded to expand its operation.
Georgia Bonded has indicated that if

“Buena Vista needs
people. It needs
growth. It doesn’t
need another smoke-
stack.”
— BV resident
Timothy Dugganm

they were able to purchase steam
from the new plant, they would in-
deed expand. Representatives from
the company presented the city coun-
cil with a petition signed by 100
employees calling for the go-ahead to
build the new power plant.

Bailey said Hadson also promised
to contribute to Buena Vista's effort
to construct a flood wall that would
protect the city from the same detes-
tation brought on by floods in 1985
and years before.

‘My concern is that the cogen-
eration plant is the wrong way to go
for Buena Vista’s future,’’ BV resi-
dent Timothy Dugganm said. ‘‘Buena
Vista needs people. It needs growth.
It doesn’t need another smokestack.”’

Mary Shewey, BV city registrar,
argued for the new plant, saying,
‘We're from an industrial city. Our
logo has smokestacks.”’

Bailey said he sees too much stu

dent apathy about the issue.

‘*People don’t know about it,’’ he
said. ‘‘] don’t know if they're just
uneducated or if they just don’t care

I hope it’s the former.’’

The Ring-tum Phi, October 4, 1990

 

Dress date

There doesn’t seem to be an easy way out of it. The
Student Bar Association wants Fancy Dress to be resched-
uled and the Student Activities Board wants nothing of the
kind.

In our opinion, the most sensible course is to leave the
FD scheduling alone, at least for this year. Certainly, there
is plenty of blame to go around. The undergraduates failed
to consult the law school calendar in scheduling FD, but the
law school has shown little interest, until this late date, in
SAB meetings or sign-ups.

Quite simply, there are too many problems involved with
rescheduling Fancy Dress this year, problems delineated by
Katie Duwel in her report to the EC. In the future, the SAB
should, as a matter of simple courtesy, consult closely with
the law school on matters of this importance. This year, that
didn’t happen, and now we’re all paying for it.

If we, the undergraduates, were placed in the law
students’ situation, no doubt we would raise all kinds of hell
about the FD scheduling. Nevertheless, we believe that,
considering the circumstances, it is a small price to pay for
law student to sacrifice the first day of their break to attend
what is without doubt the most unique aspect of Washington
and Lee’s social life.

Relations between the law school and the undergraduate
campus have traditionally been strained because of repeated
failures to communicate on such issues. In the future, we
hope that will not be the case.

Driving away from
the influence

An article in last week’s issue of the Phi reported that
the number of arrests for driving under the influence of
alcohol has dropped significantly in the last few years,
despite the number of high-profile cases that might seem to
indicate otherwise. Washington and Lee is a school steeped
in tradition, not the least of which, and deservedly so, is its
unique social atmosphere.

One of the unfortunate results of that sraciiehons; however,
had been the willingness of some students, just as those in
the rest of society, to drive home while impaired. According
to the Virginia State Police, one out of every 2,000 drunk
drivers gets caught. Almost every tradition has its negative
side, and this is no exception.

We are glad to see that the student body, - as well as
society in ‘general, is getting the hint, even though some
refuse to see it.

Programs such as Live Drive deserve credit for this
increased awareness, but such programs would go unheeded
without the compliance of the student body as a whole, and
it is they who deserve most of the congratulations.

We strongly urge the university and student leaders to
expand the Live Drive program, and hope that more students
can become involved.

To our readers

The editorial board of The Ring-tum Phi would like to
thank all those who contributed responsible responses

conceming last week’s issue. However, the Phi stands by its
stories.

Sugarman: :
Phi headline
inaccurate

It is truly sad that the sole newspaper repre-
senting Washington and Lee does not feel bound
by the same tenets of honor that govern the
student body. Your headline is more than mere
sensationalism, it is a lie, pure and simple. Pi
Kappa Phi is not facing ‘‘drug charges,’’ That is
the truth.

We understand that your paper feels the need
to write about something other than the normal
tedium and sports scores and movie reviews.
However, journalistic ethics, if not the Honor
System, should preclude printing slanderous
statements relying on nothing more than unsup-
ported rumors.

As far as this alleged investigation is con-
cerned, we would like to correct you. Pi Kappa
Phi is not under active investigation for anything.
The Dean of Students Office simply contacted
our fraternity’s leadership in order to discuss
rumors that had been circulating around campus.
Dean Howison and Dean Ruscio seemed pleased
with our internal investigation and indicated that
their investigation is only open to the extent that
their office would only react to any new informa-
tion that might arise.

Your paper’s mandate is to print accurate
accounts of the event around campus. Distorting
facts in order to create a provocative story
compromises the integrity of The Ring-tum Phi
and makes dubious. everything -you print.

Phi charged
with revenge
as motive

I am writing to express my outrage at the
lead article of the Sept. 27 edition of the Phi,
“IFC heads break rules.’’ The article appears to
be nothing more than a personal attack directed
by certain members of the newspaper staff
against Goodloe Lewis and Mike Skarda. Please
allow me to explain myself.

The Phi staff includes several members of
Pika and Sigma Chi in important positions; Chris
Baradel and Jeff Woodland are members of Pika,
and Brian Root, Andrew Waters and Jason
Kelley are members of Sigma Chi. Both Pika and
Sigma Chi were charged with a significant
number of Rush violations by the IFC; in fact
Pika committed so many Rush violations that it
lost social privileges one weekend. I charge that
the staff members mentioned above used two of
the new pledges in their respective houses to
exact revenge on the IFC. This abuse of their of
their staff positions to take revenge upon two
campus leaders such as Lewis and Skarda is
entirely unprofessional.

 

 

     

 

LETTERS

How on earth can Trevor Norris find fault
with Lewis for allegedly
giving him a beer after he accepted his offer? Is
that not entrapment? And what of Mr. Mikita,
who is ‘immediately turaed off’’ by dirty rush?
How does he defend his decision to pledge Pika,
a house that ied the way in finding new ways to
break Rush rules this year?

To the Phi staff, I suggest you use your
newspaper as a rag to cicai up some of the mud
which you so carelessly sling about.

Sincerely,
Trent Merchant ’92

Hancock

-responds to

speculation

In response to ths ietter to ine editor in the
Sept. 20 issue of The King--n Phi, I would like
to say that I find it interesting that people with
no firsthand knowledge of the circumstances
surrounding my accident seem to feel that they
have the ability to correctly apportion the blame
foi the situation and my injuries. Perhaps, if they
had access to the facts as I do, their opinions
might be different, or, at the very least, they
might allow my viewpoint without disparaging
my intelligence.

Sincerely,
Elizabeth Hancock, °93

McCormick
error criticized

While the errors in the Phi are generally of
a trivial and sometimes amusing nature, the
inaccuracies in the last issue far surpassed any
previous blunders. How I yearn for the days
when journalists had at least a rudimentary grasp
of history! I am referring specifically to the
caption which cites Cyrus McCormick as the
inventor of a reaper which somehow made cotton
a viable cash crop thus making him a perpetuator
of Southern slavery. It is preposterous that the
Phi staff would not know the difference between
a grain reaper and a cotton gin. Almost twenty
years before the end of the War, Cyrus McCor-
mick moved to Chicago to produce his new
reaper. Actually, McCormick’s invention led to
the demise of slavery, as it freed many Mid-
western boys from the task of feeding the
Yankees, and therefore allowed them to fight on
the Union lines. It is indeed a shame that the
Phi, in its pathetic attempt at wholesale distortion
of history, missed such an opportunity to remind
us all of the generous gift of over $300,000 that
he, University trustee and benefactor, and his

family made to our school. Sorry to say, it looks
as if the editors were asleep at the presses.

Sincerely,
John Ebner '91

lies to

crticis m

Dean Kenneth Ruscio’s letter in last week's
Phi concerning the Spectator’'s ‘‘Dorm Nazi”’
General Opinion unfortunately does more to
obscure the issue than to clarify it. The point of
the article is not that any current or past dorm
counselors are disciples of Adolf Hitler or that
the five counselors’ action last year violated the
fourth amendment or even that (if we reason as
Dean Ruscio would have us) inconvenient laws
ought not to be obeyed. It is simply that, last
year, a few dorm counselors committed an

egregious breach of their authority by
indiscriminately searching rooms for alcohol and

   

appropriately using the Honor Code to help
enforce dormitory rules. And, judging from Dean
Ruscio’s letter, he is in basic agreement with
this. \

That said, however, Dean Ruscio is not
finished ‘‘clarifying’’ things for us yet. His
digression on liberal judges is interesting, but it
has nothing to do with the dorm counselor raid.
It is a tremendous leap of logic (nearly akin to
saying that the ‘‘cotton reaper’ promoted slavery,
in the South) to assume that the Spectator's
concern over last year’s event has anything at all
to do with the ACLU’s concer for the so called
Miranda rights of criminals.

If we were to take Dean Ruscio at face value;
we might expect him to call for student funding
for the Spectator on the grounds that it now
offers diversity of opinion. Of course, Dean
Ruscio does not believe that the Spectator is
‘liberal’? any more than anyone else believes
that he is ‘‘glad’’ to occupy some common}
ground with it. It would seem that the Dean, who
deplores the use of hyperbole in headlines, is just
as guilty of using rhetoric as are the college:
students he criticizes, albeit with less cause.

Paul Lagarde ’91 '

Student
defends

Skarda

I have written The Ring-tum Phi on many
occasions, often taking stances on controversial |
issues, even on occasion eliciting response from |
members of the student body. Despite how much
others may have disagreed with my opinions, few |
have ever-- to my knowledge-- questioned the
ethics of my writing a signed article and submitt- |
ing it to your publication. And yet I should not |
refer to The Ring-tum Phi as your publication, for
it is not your publication, but ours-- the student
body’s. Not only do student funds support,
indeed outright maintain, the Publications Board,
the University has traditionally entrusted the Phi
with the responsibility of being the students’
publication.

It is in this esprit as the students’ own publi-
cation, that I find your editorial last week attack-
ing the character and integrity of a member of
that student body you are entrusted to serve, not
merely deeply disturbing, but grossly unethical
and unprofessional. When I also consider that
your assault on him, based on outrageous allega-
tions and suppositions, might have led members
of the student body to believe that Mr. Skarda is |
a weak drunkard, too lacking in personal strength |
to stand on his own merit, and so cowardly as to
cling to the White Book for protection from
public accusation, I become nothing short of
enraged.

As someone who has known Skarda for
nearly as long as I have attended W&L, I-- and
those around me-- firmly attest that the con-
clusions concerning his character are unfortunate,
unfounded and untrue.

The business of a student publication, funded
by the students and accountable to them, is not
to single out members of the student body and
make their character the sole subject of the
paper’s editorial. If you feel so strongly about
name calling and bloodletting, then take your
opinions to a My View and sign your name to
them. Then, with your name alongside the target
of your attack, you may ‘‘act equally bravely and
honorable by letting each member of our com-
munity make up their minds about the charges
against’ you both.

Sincerely,

P.S. I strongly urge you to exhibit appropriate
professionalism and integrity by utilizing the
paper’s editorial to make a complete and full
apology to Mr. Skarda. Although few words
now could fully restore his damaged reputation,
you consciences might rest easier in knowing
you've done your best to restore a man’s image
that became tarnished solely at the hand of your
own negligence.

OPINION
Racism is alive in Gaines Hall

 

MY VIEW
By James Elliot

 

‘‘Negroes must die,’’ ‘‘Negroes
suck,’’ ‘‘Negroes bum in hell’’ —
these phrases among others were
etched into the Gaines Hall elevator
this weekend and every person at this
university should be aware of this -
- and ashamed of it.

Every individual should be aware
of the maligned and perverted sayings
in the Gaines elevator because they
live right next to the person that
wrote the sayings; they greet that

person with a friendly ‘‘Hello’’ or
‘*Hey how are ya’ ’’ each time they
pass that person on the Colonnade -
- and that person has a big problem.

That person believes himself or
herself to be enough superior to pass
judgement on a race of human
beings.

That person harbors the abject
meanness and raw cruelty to etch his
or her vitriolic words on the door
knowing the anguish this action will
cause — and the cowardice to leave
his/her sickening, deplorable message
unsigned.

Where is honor and integrity
here?

The Ring-tum Phi, October 4, 1990

Not only does this person not
belong at Washington and Lee, this
person does not belong in the human
race — for the ignorance which
causes a person to harshly generalize
about a race of human beings and the
unmitigated meanness which accom-
panies such a feeling and action is
not human — it is bestial.

I do not suspect that the world I
live in will ever be freed of such
malice.

Nor do I expect to be able with
this letter to touch the wayward con-
science of the author of the sayings
in the Gaines elevator.

But I can express my disgust and

 

the sadness which accompanies such
disgust, I can tell every
person at this school of the rage I
felt in Gaines elevator — the anger
felt because black students were
going to walk into this elevator and
be faced with ignorant bigotry — the
anger I felt because of the bitterness
and anguish these words would cause.

It is my hope that by exposing
such hatred to a community in which
honor and integrity are integral, I can
draw heated condemnation of the
base acts perpetrated by those who
lack any measure of honor or in-

tegrity.

Honor Code and campus parking

 

MY VIEW

By T. Christopher Locke

 

Since the Phi has been calling for submissions
lately, here’s mine, concerning a problem we are
all familiar with. One day not long ago, I had
dropped my Chinese teacher, Ms. Liang, off at her
office and parked her car for her, for we were late
after dropping someone off at the airport. I was
asked to move the car by a member of W&L Sec-
urity, on the grounds that it was I parking the car
and ‘‘the faculty doesn’t like people parking their
(the faculty’s) cars up here.’’ I replied that should
be faculty’s problem. The car I was driving was
indeed Ms. Liang’s, had an ‘‘A’’ sticker, and was
being parked for the reasons I stated. If Mr. Bane
did not believe my story, he should have had me

written up on an honor violation. Otherwise, I
didn’t see the problem. He then proceeded to ask
me for my and my mother’s names.

‘*What does that have to do with anything?’’ I
asked. He apparently had assumed that it was my
mother’s car, and that my mother worked on cam-
pus to get the A sticker, or something like that. In
other words, he assumed I was lying.

I ended up parking the car of not only a mem-
ber of the faculty but a guest of this University
from a foreign country, out in the lot by Liberty
Hall, to avoid having the car towed away. As a
result, she shouldn’t find it and couldn’t use it for
a period of time after that.
the perks for being in W&L Security is being able
to park behind Evans, you know, where the sign
says ‘‘No Parking, violators will be towed’’, or
just out in the middle of the street, while one
enjoys a leisurely breakfast inside.)

(By the way, one of

thought up.

Is this a desirable consequence of having this
kind of ‘Security? ”’
against itself, it works against the University.
When I say ‘‘University;’ I mean the students and
teachers, not the Administration under whose
shadow of self-importance the University lies. One
of my Professors actually described the situation as
“the tail wagging the dog’’ for parking is just
another sizable part of this larger problem, which
not only conflicts with common sense, but with the
Honor Code as well.

I realize that the Honor Code is often violated,
sometimes under the guise of ‘‘fraternity pranks’’
and I have not the power to affect that. But when
my own integrity is called into question in a
situation where that is uncalled for, the Honor
Code comes across as no more than some silly
concept we in our ivory tower of academic naivete

Not only does it work

A multitude of My View topics

 

MY VIEW
By Brant Martin

 

Why do we always bring up the
fact that Tom Wolfe is an alumnus of
W&L? He is an incredible writer and
deserves credit for this, but he does
not seem to credit W&L as his own.
On his book jackets, it mentions only
the fact that he went to Yale. He has
not made an appearance in Lee
knows how long, not does he ever
mention W&L in interviews. Is he

ashamed of us? Perhaps he has seen

too many of us aspiring to be the
Sherman McCoys of the world and

has therefore disinherited his alma
mater. But it seems to me that Yale
doesn’t exactly cater to the under-
privileged classes, and that a cham-
pion of the poor wouldn’t need to
wave his Eli intellectual banner. If he
is going to be a snob he should at
least admit it... Why is student apathy
so high at W&L? Well, perhaps if
we could find some new issues to
debate, some interest could be
sparked. Race relations are getting
better (at least within the university
community), sexism seems to be. in
decline, and even the Speaking tradi-
tion is coming back into vogue. We
still have a long way to go, but each
(and every) side of these issues has

been more than fairly represented.
Beating dead horses makes for good
Congressional debates, but boring Phi
editorials... As much flack as the
administration gets (and usually de-
serves), for issues like the CRC, the
SAC and other controversial alphabet
committees that it empowers, it deser-
ves our congratulations and respect in
the way it has handled the car tax
issue. Hurrah to President Wilson for
standing up for the right thing and
recognizing the value of common
sense. However, if he believes the
construction companies are going to
have the refurbished fraternity houses
ready be January, it’s obvious he
hasn’t seen them yet... While you

may Or may not agree with his point,
it seems strange that a distinguished
intellectual from Dartmouth College
would take such a juvenile potshot at
W&L and The Washington and Lee
Spectator in the postscript of his
letter. If he is so righteous and jus-
tified, there is no need for childish
schoolyard insults. As mere W&L
students, we may not be moral para-
digms like the editors of the
Dartmouth Review, but I’m _ glad
we're above that type of third-grade
barb. Oooooooooh, burned us... I
don’t know. if this is long enougi. or
not, but at’ least now the editors of
The Ring-tum Phi can’t say somebody
didn’t try.

A dictionary for W&L students

 

MY VIEW
By Kari May

 

This article is in response to the
bitchy demands of the newspaper to
receive opinion articles; bitchy in this
sense meaning complaining and nagg-
ing. But let me assure you that my
intent is not to insult anybody but
rather to amuse. Calling a friend a
bitch is a compliment! Which bitch
are you? The following is a diction-
ary of terms:

ARTSY — One who regards
himself a snob about the arts.

By Rick Peltz

Anne Schroer-Lamont, associate
dean of students — Yes, I think
it’s nice if the law students can
participate with the undergradu-
ates. We need more opportunities
where both campuses can have
fun together.”’

 

BITCH, SON OF A — Included
here so that guys do not feel left out.
Realize that one term cannot apply to
all men, but place any one of these
adjectives on this list in front of this
term and... there you go!

BITCHY — A bitch who con-
stantly complains (bitches). Also, an
extreme bitch.

CHEAP — One who will not
order out pizza because she is on the
D-Hall plan and does not want to
pass up a free meal. She must save
to pay for four years of college and
so she watches every penny.

CONSERVATIVE — 70 percent
of the people on this campus.
DICTIONARY -— People like me

Amy Aussiker, 91, San Antonio,

TX — ‘‘No. We only sold 36
tickets to the Law School last
year anyway. If theyeally want
to go, they'll spend an extra night
in Lexington and leave for their
break on Saturday.”’

who sit around creating dictionaries
or other such lists. People who are
compulsive about things like this.

LAZY — People too lazy to go
up that extra flight of stairs to visit a
friend, who are too tired to move
from one location, who are too lazy
to go one step out of their way.

LIBERAL — The other 30 per-
cent.

JOURNALISTIC — Just thrown
in to describe The Ring-tum Phi's
nagging about opinion articles.

NICE — Roommate who lets you
in when you cannot find your key,
one whom always looks out for
others.

NOSEY — One who feels it is

her duty to know everything about
everybody.

RICH — Students who are here
without financial aid (this one rhymes
nicely).

SPORTY -— Those jocks who go
racing by you, constantly on their
way to and from practice.

STUPID — Slow and _simple-
minded people.

WASTEFUL — Those who use
things they don’t really need, such as
extra pencil lead doing those prob-
lems you can never figure out any-
way.

And so now you have a beginning
guide to bitchy terms. Use it wisely,
and add to it as you see fit.

 

TALKBACK

Joan Schaper, 93, Neenah, WI

They don’t put as much effort
into uniting the two campuses as
the undergrads do.”’

Survey counts sexual assaults at W&L

 

By Alisann McGloin
Staff Reporter

 

Results of a survey conducted at
Washington and Lee last spring re-
vealed that one out of seven women
in the class of 93 who responded to
the survey had been either sexually
assaulted or raped by an acquaintance
from W&L.

Seventy-six percent of the fresh-
men women responded while the
response rate for the other three clas-
ses was significantly lower, ranging
from 18 to 24 percent depending on

the class.

The high freshmen response rate
was attributed to the help of dormito-
ry counselors who distributed and
collected surveys.

Freshman dormitories, the sight of
12 incidents, and fraternity houses,
the sight of 11 incidents were cited
most frequently as the location of the
rapes or sexual assaults.

Also revealed in the survey was
that alcohol use by one or both par-
ties was involved in the majority of
the incidents, with a large portion of
them having occured at the beginning
of the academic year in September

and October. A large number of
victims had not sought counseling, or
confided in friends, family of profes-
sionals.

With a showing of less than 25
percent for upperclass women, results
may or may not be representative of
all women at W&L, according to
Associate Dean of Students Anne
Schroer-Lamont.

‘The freshmen class had the
highest level of participation, and
thus provides the most statistically
valid data from the survey,’’ said
Dean of Students David Howison,
‘But the information obtained from

 

 

 

VMI to cut

By Ashley Harper
Entertainment Editor

 

 

Virginia Military Institute set a budget
September 18 that cuts salary increases, barrack
renovations and supply and travel expenses in
an effort to help Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder
reduce state spending.

“If necessary, in the 1991-92 school year,
hourly wage people will be laid off to save
$80,000,’ said VMI Director of Information
Tom Joynes.

VMI is funded by both state tax dollars and
tuition fees. The state provides VMI with 40
percent of its operating budget. VMI’s state
money has been cut by 10 percent and its
budget must be reduced over the next two years
by $2 million. The other 60 percent of VMI’s
funds come from tuition and fees.

Joynes said, ‘‘Every possible area is
considered in deciding the cuts to make.
However, the sports and the extra curricular
activities will not be affected since they are
funded privately, and not by the state.’’

Although the July 1 - June 30 budget year
is already in effect, the cuts will take place
immediately.

The VMI barrack renovation, which was to
be funded by state lottery money, is now on
hold indefinitely. This may hamper efforts to
make the VMI a coeducational institute, since
new dorms for women would have to be built
before they can attend the school

Joynes said,‘‘The renovation will not be
under way for the next two years or until the
money is made available by the state.”’

the upperclass and law students has

Sexual assault, as defined by the
Virginia Code, means the touching of
intimate parts or clothing covering the
intimate parts...by the use of threat,
force or intimidation or due to mental
incapacity or physical helplessness of
the victim or forcing the victim to
touch the intimate parts of the ac-
cused offender.

Rape, as assigned by the Virginia
Code, means sexual intercourse with-
out consent by use of threat, force or
intimidation, or due to physical help-

lessness or mental incapacity of the
victim.

A summary of the results showed
that 23 women in the class of ‘93
reported 34 incidents of sexual as-
sault or rape over their lifetime with
7 women raped and 8 sexually as-
saulted at W&L.

Thirteen women in the class of
‘92 reported 23 incidents of sexual
assault or rape, 11 women in the
class of ‘91 reported 16 incidents, 8
women in last year’s graduating class
reported 13 incidents, and 12 law
women reported 27 incidents.

‘‘We plan to use the surveys in

the broader context of. educational
programs,’’ said Schroer-Lamont, who
coordinated the survey.‘‘We already
have in place a variety of programs
to address the problems of sexual
abuse.”’

Follow-up surveys to the 1990
survey will be completed to assess
the effectiveness of the university’s
educational initiatives, Howison said.
He said W&L’s program has been
followed by other universities.

"The university is committed to
do all it can to ensure a safe and and
supportive community for all its
students,’’ he added.

 

 

expenses

Nine Virginia state universities will raise
their tuition because of the state cuts. However,
VMI will find alternatives to raising their
tuition.

‘*A hiring freeze and reductions in funds are
already in effect,’’ VMI Superintendent Major
General John W. Knapp told The News Gazette.

The ‘‘reduction in funds’’ results in the
following cuts, as reported in The News
Gazette:

The VMI faculty was to receive a two per-
cent salary increase that all state faculty mem-

 

bers were to receive December 1. However,
cutting these salary increases will save
$100,000.

Any positions that are now vacant or will
become vacant will not be filled. This hiring
freeze will save VMI almost $140,000

Reducing equipment spending will save
$242,000. Travel and supply cuts will save
$191,000, and the faculty attrition will save
$80,000.

This year’s unexpected increase in VMI
enrollment shows $300,000 in non-general funds
that had not been budgeted.

The state will also cut aid to Virginia
students. This act will also affect Washington
and Lee University by reducing the Virginia
Tuition Assistance Grant recipients.

Wilder must reduce the state budget by $1.4
billion over the next two years in accordance
with a constitutional mandate.

The areas to be cut were chosen in order of

__. The International House makes
life easier for the thirty-three foreign
Students who attend Washington and
Lee this year, providing a ‘‘hang
‘ut’’ and companionship with other
students in the same situation.

Most of these students learned of
W&L as many of us did — through
the mail. Although there is an inter-
national recruiting program based in
the admissions office, catalogs are
Sent to foreign universities and word
is passed through embassies to find
interested students.

* Yearly exchange programs are

conducted with universities such as
Oxford in England, Chung Chi Col-
lege of Hong Kong and Rikkyo Uni-
versity in Japan. The final result of
these efforts are a select few students
who attend W&L for one to four
years.

Once the applications are in,
University Registrar has the job of
evaluating transcripts by Americar
educational standards. He then be-
comes the liaison for the accepted
foreign students, completing much
immigration paperwork and providing
any needed counseling.

Foreign students find comfort away from home

 

It’s a very good,

fessors are friendly.

vision broadcasts are provided to
make the students feel closer to
home. A pre-orientation is arranged
for the international students, as well
as Big Brother and Big Sister pro-
gram run by the East Asian Depart-
ment.

The W&L atmosphere is con-

ducive to acclimation for strangers to
the United States.

“It’s a very good, competent
place to study. The people and espe-
cially professors are friendly,’’ Japa-
nese exchange’ student Akino
Tsuchiya said. She said the size of
the campus and easy communication
with professors compelled her to
come here.

Keiko Kawai, also of Japan, was
assigned to W&L for a one year stay,
and said she is enjoying the small
school. One of the major problems
she shares with many who know

English as a second language is the
possibility of becoming completely
lost in her classes.

 

BRIEFS

Superdance will have a general meeting for old and

In Japan students are taught to
read and write English with no atten-
tion devoted to speaking, so Kawai
taught herself to speak by way of
American radio. She often records her
lectures and replays them for total
comprehension, but also finds that it
takes little effort to get extra guid-
ance from professors.

Although Hong Kong’s Joyce Lai

Ting said she finds classes at W&L
demanding, she finds the small clas-
ses and the possibility of direct con-
tact with teachers appealing. In Hong
Kong classes are much larger and
there are no special facilities such as
the language lab.

There are currently three Soviet
students at W&L. Oksana Kozhina
found out she was coming to W&L
only a short time before she left the
USSR.

In order to become an exchange
student, Soviets must pass an English
test and prepare a scientific paper on
a specialized topic. High school is
much more concentrated in the Soviet
Union, as Kozhina had to decide on
the direction of her studies earlier
than the typical American student.
Soviet exchange students have to file
a report to the State Department if
they choose to venture more than 25
miles from campus.

Funfest begins
M.D. drive

The Superdance Committee has organized Funfest
from 5-7 p.m. tonight to gain awareness for Superdance
and to begin raising money for Muscular Dystrophy.

Funfest is in Evans Dining Hall. Students can throw
darts, toss softballs and bob for apples. The cost is only
fifty cents a game. Students also have the opportunity to
dunk their favorite dorm counselors and W&L staff
members at a dunking booth.

Each winter, the committee sponsors Superdance, a
weekend of dancing and great bands, which raises money
to fight Muscular Dystrophy.

Co-chairmen Matt Wherry and Kennon Walthall said

As of Oct. 1, W&L students can print their work out

Laser printing will cost ten cents a page and student
identification cards may be used to charge the printing,
according to the University’s Assistant Treasurer John

appointed four faculty and administration members and
three students to an advisory committee as planning
continues for Washington and Lee’s new student center.

Faculty and administration members Michael Pleva,

‘‘The new center is for the whole University com-

According to Akins, the committee members will

Polo drowns Richmond 15-9

Junior Alan Herrick netted five
goals pacing the Generals, but it was
the overall team effort that propelled
head coach Page Remillard’s team by
the Spiders.

Although the last three meetings
between these two teams have: ended
in one goal differences, twice going
to overtime, the Generals eased to the
finish in this one with a six goal
cushion. Remillard thanked all the
fans that attended and said, ‘‘The last
few games with Richmond have been
decided by one goal and then this
one by six. I like to think that five
of those goals went to the crowd. It
really made a difference.”’

In Friday’s match, the Generals
used a 5-0 second quarter outburst
that opened up a 10-4 W&L halftime
lead. Although the Spiders made up
some ground in the third quarter,
erasing the deficit to four, 12-8, the
Generals rebounded in the fourth
quarter, outscoring Richmond 3-1 in

Prior to the beginning of the
1990 cross country season, junior
co-captain Charles Edwards was
predicted to be one of the top
five runners in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference.

Now, three weeks into the
season, Edwards is providing hints
that he could be sitting in the
number one spot after the ODAC
Championships on November 3.

During September the Wash-
ington and Lee men’s cross coun-
try team (4-1, 3-0 in the ODAC)
competed in three meets. Edwards
finished first in all three.

This past Saturday against
Norfolk State and Roanoke, Ed-

September 22, in a home meei

Remillard after the Generals ex-
perienced foul trouble and proved to
be the W&L leading scorer. Soph-
omore goalie P.J. Waicus made 12
saves in the game, including a penal-
ty shot, and allowed only one goal in
the shallow end of the pool while the
Generals scored eight during that
period.

Will Davis played a very consis-
tent game and registered a hat trick,
and sophomore Scott Strader scored
three times in the second quarter.
Sophomore Chris Hagge also added
two goals. Said Remillard, ‘I’m
very, very pleased with how he’s
playing. We're asking how far we
can take this guy. He’s ready to
enter a new area. He’s really playing
well.”’

Remillard said that the Generals
are playing better each week and
commented on the strength of the
team. After senior co-captain Tomas
Perez fouled out in the third quarter,
the team continued to play well.

For this upcoming weekend, when
the Generals take on the Spiders in
Richmond, W&L will need to cut
down on the number of fouls and
ejections. Friday night, the Generals
were down a man nine times. But the
W&L defense, led by Waicus kept
the Spiders from scoring more than
twice.

with Mary Washington and Wash-
ington College, Edwards clocked
in at 27:52. And a week earlier
against Bridgewater and Eastern
Mennonite, he crossed the finish
line after 26:27.

For his achievements, Edwards
has been named The Ring-tum
Phi’s  Athlete-of-the-Month _ for
September.

Edwards said he has been
consistently running more in
preparation for this season.

“Since the middle of July I’ve
been putting in 30-mile weeks,”’
he said. ‘‘The team has also had
a much more rigorous training
program. Last year we ran about
55 miles a week. Now we're
running at least 60 and have had
a 75-mile week.’’

Edwards, last year’s top runner
for W&L and the team’s recipient
of the Captains and Coaches
trophy, explained that he does not

The Washington and Lee women’s

defending Old Dominion Athletic
Conference champion Randolph-
Macon.

On Sunday, the Generals suffered
a 3-1 loss to Emory. W&L was as
close as 2-1 before Emory scored the
game clinching goal in the second
half. Freshman midfielder Corinda
Hankins scored the lone goal for the
Generals.

“We played well,’’ said head
coach Janine Hathorm. ‘‘We learned a
lot about ourselves, mostly about our
competitive limits. Emory is a tough
team.’”

On Tuesday, W&L got their first
win ever over Randolph-Macon, 2-1

goal was scored in- the first half.

From Staff Reports

The Washington and Lee
men’s soccer team ended a six
game winless streak with a 2-0
win over Old Dominion Athletic
Conference rival Hampden-Sydney
on Tuesday.

In its only other game this
week, W&L lost to Emory 2-0 on
Sunday in Atlanta, Ga. The Gen-
erals’ record is now 3-4-2 (1-0-1
in the ODAC).

Both of the Generals’ goals
against the Tigers came within 16
seconds of the second half. With
just over ten minutes to play,
sophomore midfielder Mike
Mitchem volleyed the ball into
the goal from the right side.

Seconds later, freshman for-

ward Tim McCarthy headed the
ball down the left side to another
freshman, midfielder Dan Rhodes.
Rhodes gathered the ball and
scored on a shot to the right side
of the goal from 12 yards away.

This past weekend, the men’s
and women’s cross country teams
bounced back from last week’s
defeats to Mary Washington by |
posting victories over Norfolk

R-MC runs b

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

It has been a rough two weeks for
the Washington and Lee football
team.

After losing to Centre 24-13 in
Danville, Ky., the Generals returned
home to take on defending Old Dom-
inion Athletic Conference champion
Randolph-Macon.

The Generals started slow, spott-
ing the Yellow Jackets a 14-0 lead,
before coming on to tie the game at
14-14, but the R-MC ground attack
proved too much, and the Yellow
Jackets left Lexington with a 27-14
win.
With Centre, the W&L defense
faced the third-leading rusher in
NCAA Division III in Tim McDaniel.
The chore of stopping running backs
did not get any easier with R-MC.
The Yellow Jackets used alternating
tailbacks, one an ODAC Player-of-
the-Week and the other the younger
cousin of Washington Redskins back
Kelvin Bryant.

On R-MC’s first possession, it
was the younger Bryant, Kerrell, who
shocked the W&L defense. Bryant
went 72 yards for a touchdown on
R-MC’s second play from scrimmage,
looking very much like Kelvin, to
give the Yellow Jackets a 7-0 lead.

The Generals nearly tied the game

on the second play of the second
quarter on a long pass play. On third
down and nine from midfield, junior
quarterback George Sakin scrambled
and lofted a pass toward the goal
line, but senior split end Chris Acebal
came up just short in a diving at-
tempt to catch the ball at the goal
line, and the Generals were forced to
punt.

R-MC extended the lead to 14-0
late in the half, driving 80 yards in
12 plays with the last nine yards
coming on a scoring pass from John

Smith to Eric Lewis.

In the second half, the Generals
came to life, sparked by the defense.
First it was junior cornerback Fred
Renneker. He picked off a pass at the
W&L three-yard line to stop a R-
MC drive.

Then, after a W&L turnover gave
R-MC the ball on their own 36,
junior defensive end John McCallum
sacked Scott Kirby and forced a
fumble, and senior safety Brad Miller
fell on the ball at the R-MC 32 for
W&L.

On third down and 12 from the
34, Sakin again scrambled away from
pressure and found junior slot back
Jeff Kreis open at the corner of the
end zone. Kreis caught the ball and
back-pedaled into the end zone for a
touchdown to make the score 14-7,

After a Yellow Jacket punt, W&L
couldn’t muster anything offensively

The Ring-tum Phi, October 4, 1990

y W&L 27-14 |

and had to punt the ball back. Soph-
omore Bob Ehret’s punt pinned R-
MC inside their own 20-yard line,
and the W&L defense did the rest.

On second down, Kirby again
tried to pick on Renneker. And again
Renneker picked off the pass, return-
ing this one 31 yards to the R-MC
three-yard line, setting up the W&L
offense.

After three plays netted one-yard,
on fourth down the Generals decided
to go for the touchdown. Senior
Mason Pope, who ran for 100 yards
on the afternoon, followed the blocks
of Tyler Suiters, Thomas May and
Kirk B. Sohonage into the end zone
to tie the game at 14.

But the Yellow Jackets came back.
On the ensuing possession, R-MC
drove 70 yards in 10 plays, capped
by former ODAC Player-of-the-Week
Dexter Hurt’s five-yard touchdown
run to make the score 21-14.

The Generals had one last chance
after Bryant fumbled the ball and
Miller recovered. W&L drove to the
R-MC 21-yard line before facing a
fourth down. Sakin tried to hook up
with All-American split end Craig
Irons on a timing pattern in the end
zone, but the Yellow Jackets had it
defended and Irons couldn’t get to
the ball.

The Generals, 1-3, 0-2, will look
to end a two-game skid this week at
Maryville College.

Generals spike ODAC foes SBC, R-MWC

By Chris Simon
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee volley-
ball team faced Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College at home on Wed-
nesday night and the only difficulty
they had was packing the house.

In front of a sparse crowd, the
Generals dismantled a very tame Wil-
deat team 15-12, 15-5, 15-6.

The Generals are currently 8-9, 2-
0 in the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference. Last Thursday they defeated
Sweet Briar in three games, 15-4, 15-
5, 15-9, before leaving for the Cat-
holic Tournament where they finished
fifth in a competitive field of seven
teams.

Against Sweet Briar the Generals

played consistently and up to poten-
tial, something head coach Susan
Dittman has been looking for
throughout the pre-season. Freshman
Tara Burns made her first start and
responded under pressure with eight
kills and a .350 attack percentage.
Junior Mena McGowin added 19 kills
and 10 digs while senior setter Lisa
Jay passed out 29 assists.

After hoping to finish in the top
two at Catholic, the Generals were
somewhat disappointed with a fifth
place finish, however such tourna-
ments serve greater purposes. ° --

W&L escaped unscathed with
wins over Iona, 15-8, 15-6, and
Marymount, 15-11, 15-7. Jay was
named to the All-Tournament squad
with 93 assists.

Going into their second ODAC

 

 

AGO
feats eg

match of the season, the Generals
hoped to return to their form against
Sweet Briar, moving the ball around
effectively to middle and weakside
attacks.

Behind 13 service aces, the Gen-
erals rolled over Randolph-Macon in
three games. Jay received unusual
assist assistance from juniors Rashmi
Sachan and McGowin, and soph-
omore Leslie Hess. Hess amassed
two solo blocks and .307 attack per-
centage.

The only disappointment was” a
lack of fan support. Following road
games to Emory and Henry, Ferrum,
and Lynchburg, the Generals return
home for their two biggest obstacles
on the road to ODAC championship,
Eastern Mennonite and Bridgewater.

Four Past Midnight shows maturity

Stephen King’s latest novel is a step above his other works

 

By Chris Swann
Staff Reporter

 

Stephen King has shown his on-
going maturity as a writer with his
new book Four Past Midnight.

Consisting of four novellas, Four
Past Midnight offers King’s usual
blend of mysterious events, hair-rais-
ing suspense and naked terror. Yet
the book contains moments when the
imagery and writing seem a step
above King’s other works. His
characters are fuller and more
developed, as are their relationships
with each other. His imagery has
become richer and more varied rather
than his usual grotesque and horrific
comparisons, although the horrific is
indeed found in this book.

The book is wonderful for people
who don’t feel they have the time to
read a whole novel. The longest
novella is 246 pages. The shortest is
153 pages. Each of the novellas have
an introduction and prefatory notes by
the author.

The writing flows fairly well,
although there are moments of descri-
ption that extend for half a page or
so. The book is terse for a writer
who has self-described ‘‘diarrhea of
the word processor,’’ and most of
those passages are not harmful to the
text or the story as a whole.

Four Past Midnight contains four
concepts worthy of attention, and
King gives them that attention. He
plants images in the story that he
picks up later with startling and
sometimes humorous results, for
example a perfume image in The
Langoliers and the effect it might
have on you. King deals with
humans as more than mere vehicles
or subjects for his terrifying themes.
The relationships between Sam
Peebles, Naomi and Dirty Dave in
The Library Policeman are tender and
teal. Craig Toomy, the overstressed
businessman in The Langoliers, is a
frightening portrayal of real human
anguish and suffering released in a
dangerous and lethal way. Pop Mer-
rill in The Sun Dog is a magnificently
shady character, old and musty yet
strong, straddling the line between
selfishness and evil.

 

The first story, The Langoliers, is
the longest and the best of the four.
A red-eye flight from LA to Boston
gets slightly off-schedule and lands in
a strangely empty world. Something
is waiting for the eleven survivors,
some of King’s most creative charac-
ters yet, who are thrust into a strug-
gle with life-or-death odds, or worse.

Secret Window, Secret Garden
shows less of the supernatural and
more of the dark side found in every
man. A disillusioned author retreats
to his lakeside cabin after a divorce
to find peace and rediscover his
writing talent. What he finds instead
is John Shooter, a rather menacing
character cloaked in evil and accusa-
tion.

In The Library Policeman, King
plunges back into supernatural horror
with a story that twists a playful
childhood story (‘‘Bring your library
books back on time, children, or I'll
send the Library Policeman after
you.’’) into a tale of chilling fear. A
small-town businessman becomes
involved with a strange librarian, a
librarian who has been dead for
decades. And a horrific incarnation
of the Library Policeman wants Sam
Peeves S0Ul...

The Sun Dog, perhaps _ the
strangest story of the four, takes
place in fictitious Castle Rock,

Maine, King’s longtime setting for
books such as Cujo and The Dead
Zone. It concerns Polaroid photo-
graphs, a particular interest, or per-
haps obsession, of the author’s, and
a rather peculiar canine, which begins
to terrify a shifty junk-store dealer.
The Sun Dog is the prologue to an
upcoming King novel, Needful
Things, which will be the last of the
Castle Rock stories.

Since the 1974 publication of
Carrie, King’s first novel, he has
written over thirty novels and screen-
plays, including The Shining, It, The
Dark Tower series and Pet Sematary.
Having been accused of being a
“pop" author and a_ sensationalist,
King has written his share of bad
novels. His imagination and thematic
ideas, however, have grown and
flourished, culminating with his apo-
calyptical work The Stand, in which
Good and Evil battle it out once and

ae oy

for all in a world devoid of 99.7
percent of its population. Such a
concept would be a difficult one for
an author to pull off realistically, yet
King delivers as he does with his
other good works, combining concep!
and writing in a pleasing and effec-
tive manner, as he does in Four Past
Midnight.

King is not, and will not be, a
greatly recognized writer of literature.
He says in the preface to The Sun
Dog that he doesn’t write in the same

league as William Faulkner or J.R.R.
Tolkien. It would be a shame, how-
ever, to pass up these four stories of
horror and suspense that show some
writing genius, nuggets of gold in a
silver mine.

Whatever else he may. be, King is
the master of taking his readers down
shadowy paths and into cobwebby
closets, showing us skeletons better
left alone that will keep you up all
night, either in interest for his stories,
or in fear.
