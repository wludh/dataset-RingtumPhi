Law dean
comes out
of closet

By Les Spine
Staff Reporter

 

 

, Randall Bezanson, Dean of the
Washington and Lee School of Law,
bmerged from a utility closet Mon-
day, claiming to have been trapped
there for a week.

¢ “TF just can’t tell you how thrilled
| am to be out in the open,’’ Bezans-
on said. ‘‘I couldn’t stand to drink
‘another bottle of cleaning fluid.’’

Bezanson said he was locked into
the closet March 18, just hours before
the law faculty voted on the policy to
keep discriminating employers, in-
‘cluding the military, from recruiting
m the law school campus.

The policy was upheld on a 10-
110 tie which could have been broken
only by Bezanson.
' ““T don’t know if I would’ve
woted if I’d been there,’’ Bezanson
said. ‘‘Taking a stand can be so
‘difficult, and at least now I have an
jexcuse for remaining spineless."’

Bezanson declined to say why he
twent into the utility closet March 18,
but a source who identified himself
‘as ‘Deep Throat’’ said the dean
soften disappears for hours at a time.

Head of Security Charles ‘‘Murp-

'h’* Murray said his staff might have
jaccidently locked Bezanson in the
closet. Murray said The Ring-tum Phi
‘editors received threatening phone
ycalls March 18, and the security staff
jumped into action.
( “When we get death threats like
that, my staff goes into Defcon 2
immediately,’’ Murray said. ‘‘We
lock up every door on campus, no
;matter who’s in the closet.”’ ;

Murray said the Phi editors are in
/hiding, reportedly in the storeroom at
the Palms, until the caller is caught.

He said the threatening calls had
ibeen traced to the Dean of Students
Office, and he and the police are
‘investigating.

Gay mag
ranks W&L

in top

By Haight Ashbury
of The Daily Berkleyian

A national gay and lesbian rights
magazine has followed U.S. News and
World Report's lead and _ ranked
Washington and Lee number 4 on its
list of ‘‘our favorite colleges.”’

An article accompanying school
rankings in Out magazine’s March 21
issue said recent action by W&L’s
law school faculty prompted the
magazine’s staff to take a closer look
at the school, which they had pre-
viously ‘‘dismissed as a bastion dis-
criminatory conservatism.”’

W&L was ranked behind San
Francisco State, New York University
(located in Greenwich Village on
Manhattan) and the University of
Iowa. Out Editor Dimitri Glover said
he was pleased when he heard of the
law school faculty’s recent vote to
ban any campus job recruiters who
discriminate on the basis of sexual
preference, including the U.S. mili-
tary.

“I was just tickled by what they
did,’’ Glover said. ‘‘Those faculty
members took a stand and offended
all their students and all their alumni,
but what they did was right for our
brothers and sisters in bondage.’’

Dean of the Law _ School
‘“‘Dancin’’’ Randy Bezanson said he
was overjoyed by the miagazine’s
ranking.

‘*That’s what we were hoping for

five

all the time,’’ Bezanson said. ‘‘We’ve
finally been recognized by a great

magazine like Out. Those Army
wieners be damned.”’
The Out artice cited W&L’s

“‘steady march toward outright liber-
alism’’ as a main criterion for its
selection.

‘*‘W&L is by no means politically
correct yet,’’ the article said, ‘‘but
it’s getting there. A couple more
years and a couple more deans and
the school will be attracting more
people with alternate lifestyles than
he --- we mean i --- can
accomodate.”’

In response to the ranking, outgo-
ing Dean of Freshmen Ken Ruscio
said he will suggest to his successor
that a special dorm hall be set aside
for freshmen ‘‘who express interest in
different types of relationships.’’

‘*That was why we had an out-
doorsmen hall this year,’’ Ruscio
said.

“*Hopefully in a couple of years
every freshman will be able to live
on a hall with people who are exactly
alike, and they won’t have to learn to
live in a community with people who
have different viewpoints and back-
grounds.”’

In celebration of the ranking,
University Psychologists Dean-Anne-
Schorer-Lamont and Jim Worth are
planning a special afternoon group-
therapy session to help students ‘‘deal
with our recent success.”’

Police to take car parts in lieu of tax

 

By G. Huntington Wellington IV
Staff Reporter & Porsche Owner

 

As a recourse against W&L stu-
dents who refuse to pay their car tax,
Lexington City Council last week
voted to begin removing portions of
the students’ cars instead.

Lexington Mayor H.E. ‘‘ Another
Buddy’’ Derrick announced the plan
at Thursday's council meeting where-
in students who have not paid the
tax, which is 4.25 percent of the
assessed value of the vehicle, will
have 4.25 percent of their car taken
by the city.

‘There is a law which is already
in the Virginia state codes which says
we are allowed to weld off chunks
of people’s cars who~don’t pay their
taxes,’’ said Derrick. ‘‘We’re just
going to begin enforcing it.’’

Responsibility for the new city
policy, dubbed ‘Operation BMW
Storm,’ has been given’ to
Lexington’s powerful Department of
Parking, Bicycle Regulation, Animal
Control and Fashionable Pants, Of-
ficer R.D. Clark.

Clark, who has already begun
zealously collecting car parts, said the
size of the section he takes depends
on the car.

Wilson’s wife booted for freshman dorm window wreckage

 

By HLE. “‘the real Buddy” Derrick
Staff Reporter

 

The Board of Trustees ordered
University President John D. Wilson
to suspend his wife Thursday after
she broke two windows in Graham-
Lees Dormitory.

‘We feel there is no other cho-
ice,’’ said University Rector A. Stev-
ens Miles, Jr. ‘‘Wilson himself set
the precedent, and the Board felt a
double standard would be inappropri-
ate.”’

Mrs. Wilson, distraught over Sat-
urday ’s sudden death of Dean of
Students David L. Howison, was
trying to sleep when the noise from
a second floor party became unbear-
able.

‘“T think the whole situation be-
came a little too much for Anne,”’
explained Wilson. ‘‘She grabbed my
entire Mahler compact disc collection
and just heaved it over the fence at
the freshmen.”’

After the compact discs, Mrs.
Wilson followed with a set of antique

Tragedy struck the sleepy Lexi-
ngton community Saturday night in
the form of gang warfare resulting in
the brutal deaths of four gangsters.

This showdown was the culmina

vases sculpted by George Washington
at Valley Forge and valued at about
$30,000.

While the CD collection missed
the windows, all three vases hit the
mark.

According to Security Chief Char-
les F. ‘‘Murph’’ Murray, the first
vase took out the stereo, the second
toppled a keg of beer, and the third
knocked an unidentified student un-
conscious.

The student's attomey, Thomas C.
Spencer, said his client will file char-
ges against Mrs. Wilson and the
University.

The keg destroyed in the melee is
part of a revolutionary new program
instituted by Dean of Freshmen and
Residence Life Kenneth Ruscio.

“If we supply the freshmen with
alcohol at the University’s expense,
they will no longer be forced to
break both school policy and the
law,’’ said Ruscio.

During her six-month suspension,
Mrs. Wilson will not be allowed to
either represent the school or live on
campus.

left a trail of camage and bloodshed
from the streets of Compton to the
mountains of the Shenandoah Valley.

Eyewitnesses said the ‘‘L-Posse’’
was lounging in front of Harb’s Bis-
tro, searching for a man named
Lloyd, when a W&L van cruised by
spraying bullets into the crowd of
gangsters.

According to Lexington Police
Chief Bruce ‘‘I drool on my’’ Beard,
four members of the ‘‘W&L-Posse’’
were arrested in connection with the

ing, a side mirror or a hubcap or two
will be 4.25 percent,’’ said Clark.
‘*But when it’s a Bimmer, ya usually
end up taking a whole door.”

In order to carry the car sections,
Clark said he has rented a U-Haul
trailer to pull behind his awe-inspir-
ing RDX 1000 ‘‘Ticketmobile’’ (ba-
tteries not included).

Reactions to the new policy from
student representatives have been
mixed.

Executive Committee president
Tom Hatcher said he will not recon-
sider a boycott of city businesses to
protest the new tactics.

Wilson said the suspension from
campus would not be an incon-
venience as he and his wife rarely
spend much time on campus anyway.

‘Keeping her on campus would
defeat the entire purpose of suspend-
ing her,’’ said Wilson. ‘‘Thank heav-
ens she didn’t break a window here
in Lee House, I might have been
forced to divorce her.”’

While Wilson was unsure about
what his wife would be doing until
September, he did mention she has
received an offer from Baltimore
Orioles Manager Frank Robinson.

‘Hell, anyone, regardless of age
or gender, with an arm that can
heave a set of 20-pound vases 100
feet through a window with pin-point
accuracy is worth a shot on the Ori-
oles pitching rotation,’’ said Robin-
son.

His wife’s pitching career, howev-
er, was the least of Wilson’s worries.

“CD collection was priceless, just
priceless,’’ said Wilson. ‘‘Let me tell
you, she grabbed them out of spite.
She’s one of those Tchaikovsky fre-
aks.”’

arrested were John D. Wilson, Ann
‘‘Shore’’ Lamont, Leroy C. Atkins,
and Hampden H. ‘‘the Hamster’
Smith.

‘*These hoodlums were packing

some serious heat,’’ said Beard.
“They had flare guns, sawed-off
shotguns, AK-47s, Uzis, bazookas,

Scud missiles, smart bombs and the
CRC handbook. I’m just glad that our
anti-gang specialist, R.D
Clark, spent the summer training with

**Scooter’’

““My feeling is that it would hurt
the wrong people,’’ said Hatcher.
‘For example, trouble with the
town’s businesses could really cripple
Spectator advertising and we couldn't
have that.’’

Hatcher went on to say he is
drafting a letter to the council mem-
bers on behalf of W&L students. The
Ring-tum Phi has obtained a copy of
the letter, which is reprinted (with the
permission of Mock Convention offi-
cials) in its entirety below:

Dear City Council -- Please,
please, please, please, please don't
hurt my truck. Lovingly, Tom (Kentuc-

Interfraternity Council vice presi-

mulating a different plan of action.

In a statement issued to the Ring-
tum Phi, Lexington News-Gazette,
Roanoke News and World Report,
Washington Post, New York Times,
Associated Press, USA Today, Boise
Courier-Journal-Inquirer-Sun, and the
Weekly World News, Skard.. said, ‘‘I
think everyone in the whole town

In other action, the City Council

taxes on student VCRs, toothbrushes,
pillowcases, and Duck Head pants.

OPINION

Got ‘em all

April fools! Needless to say this week’s Phi is a
complete sham, a hoax, a little tomfoolery. We hope
everyone enjoys it — they damn well better since we put
sO much time into it. We haven’t meant to offend anyone,
at least not seriously. So if you have a problem with
anything that has been printed on these pages, suck it up; it
could have been a lot worse.

We would like to state here and now for the record that
the entire staff will be carrying around copies of the U.S.
Supreme Court’s decision in Falwell v. Hustler for the next
week. In its opinion, the court stated that a libel case can
not be won against a publication understood by the majority
of its readers to be a parody. (Some might say that we
could hide under this defense for all Phi issues, but we'll
only claim it this week.)

This issue has become the traditional farewell from the
senior members of the staff as they pass the baton to the
next year’s staff.

At this point, we will cease and desist our rhetoricizing.
We will leave you with a repeat of one of our proudest
moments; the publication of which brought the staff more
laughter than it did the readers. Enjoy the break from our
usual preaching, since it’s probably the only one you'll ever
get.

And here, for your repeated viewing pleasure, our guy
Cy:

 

It’s all his fault.

Cyrus Hall McCormick stands ever-vigilant over the Colonnade. A
native New Yorker, McCormick spent his Spring Breaks in
Lexington, where he invented the wheel. The wheel was later
instrumental in the invention and mass production of automobiles,
thus enabling students from all over the country to converge on
little Lexington to use the all important police and road mainte-
nance services the city so cheerily provides, which, in turn, led the
omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient Lexington City Council to
decide that taxation without representation isn’t such a bad ideal
after all.

MY WILL
By David L. Howison

 

Believe it or not, I was a pre-med
major in college. But, in my junior year
our Comparative Anatomy professor
took our class to visit the Ohio State
University Medical School. The thing
that impressed me most during the med
school visit was the cadaver.

I didn’t like it at all. It had purple-
gray blotched skin, sunken eyes, and a
bloated belly. Its feet were wrinkled
and curiously bent out of shape. It was
then-and-there that I decided medicine
was not for me. I was filled with a new
goal; someday I would become the
Dean of Students at Washington and
Lee.

Now, having achieved my goal, with
no more worlds to conquer, and being
of sound mind and body, I bequeath the

Dear Editorial Page Editor,

This is in reference to those appalling "Sbar
Side" articles that appear regularly on your page.
I urge you to stop printing them immediately.

Mr. Sbar has an unhealthy obsession with
perverse sexual behavior, cherry wine coolers,
nudity, disgusting bodily functions, butt thong
swim suits, narcotics, large canines, loud rock-
n-roll music, and halitosis. He is a no good,
cheap thrill, an untalented hack, and an
embarrassment to American journalism.

Besides, Mr. Sbar is one of the worst writers
I’ve ever seen. He certainly does not subscribe
to PC thought. If I had my way he’d be shot at
dawn.

Sincerely,
Hampden H. Smith, Ill
Professor of Journalism

they're any good. I print them because he is my

plenty for everyone. So, come and get your baby
asparagus spears. We look forward to seeing

School to build
freshman castle

By Cinderella
Fairy Tale Editor

re

 

' Only one week after the Interfraternity Council’s decision to move rush to
January, University Director of Capital Planning Frank Parsons announced that
next year’s freshmen will live in a castle surrounded by a moat.
+ “It’s the only way we can keep upperclass claws off them for four
jonths,”’ Frank ‘*We-don’t-expect-anymore-delays’’ Parsons said.

He said construction on the castle will begin in the ravine between the
library and the gym soon after Lee Chapel is razed to provide a site for the
new student center.

* “The castle will be accessible only by monorail,’’ Parsons said. ‘‘We’ll

shuttle in professors and dining service, so the freshmen should never have

to leave.”’

' Dean of Students David Howison said, ‘‘It will really give the freshmen

t chance to get to know each other and adopt politically correct behavior,
efore we expose them to the untamed campus.”’

Parsons said the architect who designed the Walt Disney World’s Magic

Kingdom Castle and Typhoon Lagoon has been hired to design the new fresh-

man housing.

» “The only input I’ve had in the design at this point,’’ Parsons said, ‘‘is

to insist on at least five gatehouses and rubber-black stairways with hot pink

tailings encased in glass. I think that’s the look of the future.’’

: Parsons said that other than the stairways, the castle will have ‘‘very few”’

Windows, which, in accordance with Rockbridge school board regulations, will

pot open. .

“The administration, excepting President Wilson’s wife, doesn’t think there
should be any windows,’’ Howison said. ‘‘But we've decided to put in a few

plexiglass, brick-resistant portholes so that freshmen don’t forget what the sun

fooks like.”’ ii

, IFC President Goodloe Lewis said he expects the moat to cut down on
rush violations.

’ “Rush violations will cost you an arm and a leg literally now,’’ Lewis
paid, ‘‘since live man-eating reptiles will live in the moat. That'll make it
a lot harder for houses to budget for violations.’’ [Note: Despite Lewis’ sexist
vemark, the reptiles will eat both men and womyn equally. — PC Ed.]

, Former Student Conduct Committee Chairman Tom Spurgeon said that he
respects the university’s progressive trend in housing, but is concerned about
student autonomy.

, ‘Since freshmen will not be allowed to interact with upperclassmen, who
will handle conduct offenses that occur in the castle?’’ he asked. ‘‘The SCC?
EC? CRC? IFC? SAC? SAB? SBA? or perhaps the Spring Term Commit-
tee?”

‘ Howison said there is no question that the Confidential Review Commit-
kee, CRC (not the Constitutional Revisions Committee, also CRC), will handle
castle conduct cases, CCCs.

“The CRC, not the EC, SCC, IFC or SAC, will of course handle CCCs,”’
‘Howison said. ‘‘They will possibly meet in a secret place at an undisclosed
time to talk about confidential matters with the unidentified parties most likely
‘involved.”’

, He said that though the decisions of the CRC will be confidential, the
accused may pay a declassification- processing fee of $400 to leam the
‘verdict.

Parsons said he hopes the accumulated fees will help pay for the freshman
complex.

+ ‘“Otherwise,’’ Parsons said, ‘‘we’ll have to increase the Greek tax again.”

fectively perform the duties of SCC
Chairman.”’

While the police continue their
search for concrete evidence to tie the
weapon to the victim, administration
officials have begun a search for
another new dean of students.

President Wilson, overwrought
with grief, said he wished to express
his sincerest sympathy to the family
and suggested they move to the

 

 

Bronx, which is now safer than
crime-ridden Lexington.
Howison will long be rem-

embered as the man who installed
critical probation, brought safety and
order back to the greek system, and
was never afraid to stand up against
the unfair decisions made by
university presidents.

He will be sorely missed.

 

 

 

This is an artist's rendition what the new freshman castle will
probably look like. The castle, designed to maintain “no contact"
prior to fraternity rush, will be equipped with a moat filled with
ferocious reptiles and a monorail system as its only contact to the
outside world.

Buddy takes
to tunnels

By Demi Moore
Staff Reporter

 

 

The ghost of former Associate Dean of Students for Greek Affairs, Leroy
Cole ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins III, has reportedly been spotted haunting the
Washington and Lee sewer system.

‘Terrence and I were just walking around in the woods, when Buddy
popped out of a storm drain,’ senior Linda McCormack said. ‘‘He looked
the same, down to his little plaid jacket and bow tie.”’

Atkins drowned in a puddle April 1, 1990, despite several rescue attempts.

Other studenis said they have also encountered Atkins ghost around
campus, especially near the Pit on dollar draft nights. The ghost has
apparently said the same thing to several students.

‘He walked right up to me moaning ‘Forgive me for the Greek fee,’’’
sophomore Mary Nohouse, a Chi Omega, said. ‘‘I told him to go to Hell,
and he kind of cringed.’’

University Psychiatrist James Worth said God might be punishing Atkins
for his sins.

‘*Buddy could be doomed to roam the campus until he’s forgiven for the
Greek fee and the Renaissance program,’’ Worth said.

Atkins’ fate has apparently had an effect on University Treasurer Lawrence
Broomall. At a recent meeting, Broomall! said Renaissance was a mistake and
the Greek fee was sham.

“If I confess now, maybe I can save myself from eternal damnation,”’
Broomall said. ‘‘I just don’t want to end up like Buddy. Anything but that.”’

The brothers of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Atkins’ fraternity, are reportedly
starting a letter-writing campaign to God on Atkins’ behalf.

‘‘Maybe we can persuade Him to let Buddy rest,’’ junior Bob Lee said.
“If Sherman wasn’t forced to be a ghost, I don’t see why God can’t cut
Buddy a little slack.’’

“Something’s strange, in the neighborhood, that’s for sure,” says
the Rockbridge County Ghostbusters crew. Not even a bag of new
bow ties would entice what is believed to be the ghost of Leroy
“Buddy” Atkins from the W&L tunnels.

 

a

Bahamas...It just isn’t fair," Broomall
whined.

Just then Parsons charged through
Broomall’s door and dragged him out
of the room.

Frank A. "Phase I is Right on
Schedule" Parsons, Coordinator of
Capital Planning, admitted Fraternity
Renaissance is a sham designed spe-
cifically to eliminate several fraterni-
ties and increase University control of
the entire fraternity system.

"They [fraternities] are evil and
this [Renaissance] is the best way we
found to crack down on them,” Par-
sons said as he pounded on his desk.

As Parsons dragged the treasurer
out of the room, Parsons was heard
shouting hysterically at students pass-
ing through Washington Hall.

“This is my school," he screamed,
"and don’t you forget it. Now you
see who the real boss is around

nee at

Sham swallows Geek Tax

here!"

He then dropped Broomall, who
curled up in a fetal position on the
floor and whimpered, "It’s ol
fair...It’s not fair." rc

Parsons sprinted back to his office
and grabbed a 12 gauge shotgun. He
fired two shots into the office of
University President John D, Wilson,
killing his secretary in the process.

Wilson immediately placed Par-
sons on Social Probation. He ex-
plained that the University could not
condone such a_ dangerous
atmosphere. \

"We must send a message thal
such behavior will not be tolerated,”
Wilson said. "The seriousness of his
actions and the threat posed to the
W&L community demanded that, he
be punished. I know Frank now
realizes he can’t go around shooting
people’s noggins off." ‘

Agents site lack of supplies ,

 

By Mighty Mayo
Staff Reporter

 

Federal agents seized three Wash-
ington and Lee fraternity houses
Tuesday afternoon after a campus-
wide search revealed that their other-
wise extensive house drug supplies
were lacking common, over-the-
counter cold medications.

‘‘They seem to have everything
else the guys could want...from mari-
juana to crack and acid, pills, needles
and joints,’’ one federal agent said.
‘‘And their organization of the drugs
and paraphernalia is the best seen.’’

The recent problem though, feder-
al authorities said, is that the guys
are suffering from cold and flu sea-
son, and ‘‘frankly, they just don’t
feel like shooting up.’’ Many brothers
in these three houses have been miss-
ing house meetings due to hacking
coughs that will not allow them to
hold pot smoke in their lungs for
sufficient intervals of time.

“It’s just plain embarrassing,”’
one fraternity brother said. ‘‘I’d rath-
er skip the meeting than look like I
can’t hold my smoke.”’

Federal agents partly blame the
house mothers for such neglect.

‘Until now, we've left the diug
supply responsibility up to the hoyse
mothers, but I can see that this will
no longer be sufficient,’’ a FBI agent
raged. ‘‘More than 30 boys have
already approached me saying that
they can’t snot their usual lines\of
cocaine because their noses are all
stuffed up. It’s just a disgrace.”’ *

The fraternities involved have
been losing money because the sick
brothers are refusing to pay dug
dues, and the house mothers contin-
ue to put the houses into debt by
buying more paraphernalia and sorting
instruments. Rumor has it that some
of the fraternity Renaissance money
might even be involved. Federal
agents will begin a full-scale investi-
gation immediately.

“It’s just too bad that these three
houses had to give a bad wrap for all
fraternities on campus,’’ a recent
initiate of a house not involved said.
‘“‘T mean, some have been keeping
all of their drug supplies fully
stocked, like mine for instance. My
brothers are all healthy and high. ‘It’s

The Washington and Lee Board of
Trustees shocked campus administra-
tors and students on Monday with
their announcement that the venerable
Lee Chapel, home to more than a
century of tradition laden campus
events, would be leveled October of
this year.

The Board, reached during their
bi-monthly meeting in the- Cayman
Islands, announced their intentions to
replace the historic structure under
the current capital improvement pro-
gram.

In a related item, it announced
preliminary contracts with an Orlan-
do, Fla., based contractor had been
drafted for an epic $10 million Stu-
dent Center, to be built on the foun-
dation of the soon-to-be-demolished
chapel.

Campus Life Committee Chairman
Don Muchfun, ‘55, quipped on the
decision, ‘‘look, we’re tired of all
this flack about the Lenfest Center
being smaller than Lee Chapel, so we
felt the best way to solve the prob-
lem was to level the Chapel to make
way for our next big project, the
Non-Fraternity, Non-Student Union,
or NFNSU.”’

Asked about this turnabout in
board policy concerning the new
center and the chapel, University
President John Wilson remarked,
“‘well, we here in Washington Hall
are both deeply saddened at the fate
of the chapel, and greatly excited on
the coming state of the art student
center. I have to say, I feel totally
vindicated by the board’s decision, as
I have been trying to fill the ODK
and Convocation ceremonies for nine
years with stirring Ivy League speak-
ers, and, since no one appreciated my
efforts, now I get to just
heh,heh...take out some walls and
windows, so to speak.”’

University Treasurer Lawrence
Broomall, the always cheery and
politically correct guru of the as-yet
successful Fraternity Renaissance, was
unwilling to elaborate on the decision
with the Phi, except to say ‘‘it’s not
a big deal ... so we’re tearing down
an obsolete church that hasn’t been
used for that purpose in fifty years

 

Lawrence Broomall

anyway.”’

When asked why the University
was so quick to approve the destruc-
tion of a national landmark, Broomall
quipped, ‘‘Well, Darryl Gotrocks
(‘70) and his wife Willemina have

The Ring-tum Phi, April 1, 1991

Axe falls on Lee Chapel

just donated a ton of money to the
school, stipulating that we must at-
tempt to redefine the architectural
heritage of the campus with his grant.
You can’t just look a gift horse in
the mouth, now can you?”’

One university spokesman told the
Phi that he was very excited about
the new center, and the varied func-
tions it would provide the communi-
ty. ‘‘Among many other things, we
are planning for it to accommodate
about 1000 for lunch, dinner, or late
night espresso (with a twist of lime)
study breaks. Thirty bowling lanes
will be in lower level 5, and private
rooms for spontaneous chess and
bridge tournaments will be among the
highlights of the NFNSU. We think
it will solve the problem of no cam-
pus facility for uniting the student
body very nicely ... plus we are plan-
ning to initiate the freshmen into
W&L life through a three week
orientation/sleepover in the new cen-
ter, prior to any upperclass conflict.”

An open forum for student reac-
tion to board decisions will be held
on the ruins of the Chapel sometime
during Thanksgiving Break in the
Fall.

The controversial rap group 2 Live Crew will be as nasty as they
wanna be next week when they perform in Lee Chapel.

The concert will be the farewell performance before demolition of the
chapel makes way for the new Student Center.

“T thouroughly enjoy the music of 2 Live Crew,’’ W&L President
John Wilson said. ‘‘Their concert will assure us that Lee Chapel goes out

Several members of the administration were angered by the decision
to allow the group to come to W&L.

‘I’m furious they would let those foul-mouthed hooligans perform in
Lee’s final resting place,’’ Dean of Students David Howison said before
his untimely death. ‘‘Let’s get a truly talented performer like Madonna.”’

Wilson and the Board of Trustees decided earlier this week to raze Lee
Chapel to provide a site for the new Student Center.

W&L Security expects a large crowd at the concert. They estimate
3,000 students and area residents will attend.

‘I’m hoping for a large crowd that is prone to violence,’’ Head of
Security Charle ‘‘Smurf’’ Murray said. ‘‘They might get rough and start
the demolition of the chapel early.’’

NOTICE
OF ZONING

 

By J. Austin Murphy
Staff Reporter

Sophomore Bryan Brading, the
razzle-dazzle sharpshooter for the
Washington and Lee Generals, yester-
day bid a sudden and unexpected
farewell to his college basketball
career.

In a Warner Center press confer-
ence, Brading announced he was
forfeiting his final two years of eligi-
bility for the fame and fortune of the
National Basketball Association.

“The W&L program has been
good to me, but it’s time to move
on,’’ the five-foot, five-inch dynamo
said in a prepared statement. ‘‘This
wasn’t a very difficult decision. It’s
either pay $12,000 a year to play or
get paid $1.5 million a year to play.’’

Although he is not projected to be
a lottery pick, the Generals’ reserve
guard said he could be among the top
five or six backcourt selections. Com-
ing off the bench, Brading averaged
2.9 points and 1.1 assists during the
1990-91 season. Someone said he
once made a three-point shot.

‘‘The level of play in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference is just
a notch or two below that of the
NBA,”’ said Brading, who led W&L
in forced shots and silly tumovers.
“Pro scouts know I’m good and I
expect to be picked pretty early on
draft day.”’

and 5°7" Spud Webb, inspired his
decision.

“T can’t dunk like Spud, but
sometimes I can jump up and grab
the net. If I don’t let go, I can pull
myself up and hang on the rim. Then
I feel really dominant,’ he said.

When contacted late yesterday, a
spokesman for the Charlotte Hornets
expressed interest in Brading.

“Actually, I’ve heard how he
handles the ball,’’ the spokesman
said. ‘‘If we get him, we’ll channel
his ballhandling abilities into luggage
handling. Hey, after all, someone's
got to carry the team’s baggage in
airports.”

Fans of Generals’ basketball said
Brading could be a fine pro.

“T think 1 saw Bryan play once
and he reminds me of Georgia Tech’s
Kenny Anderson, my favorite play-
er,’ said senior Tim Halloran. ‘‘l
know very little about the game. Hell,
I can’t even dribble the ball. But he
looked okay during a layup drill in
warmups.”

Junior ‘Trevor Hildebrand said he
is still furious about a referee’s trav-
eling call against Brading in Novem-
ber.

Not everyone, however, is opti-
mistic about Brading’s NBA career.

‘Every time we play one-on-one
I cream the guy,”’ said freshman Matt
Newton. ‘‘We played two days ago
and I beat him 21-1. No way can he
play pro ball. I couldn’t even get
picked for a church-league team last Bryan Brading’s family cheers at his announcement to turn pro.

Canfield goes to the women’s team

 

By E.M. Swift
Staff Reporter

 

Saying he felt he needed a career
change, Washington and Lee men’s
basketball coach Vere Canfield
announced Monday that he was re-
signing.

“I’ve done it all, I just don’t see
myself going any further. I can only
hope the students at W&L can find it
in their hearts to forgive me for
leaving,’’ Canfield said in front of
approximately 200 reporters.

Washington and Lee athletic
director Mike Walsh, who has been
in constant touch with Canfield since
his announcement, said that Canfield
has decided to continue coaching at
Washington and Lee, as coach of the
women’s club basketball team.

‘‘He’s always been a big fan of
the women’s program. One time he
even donated the men’s uniforms and
basketballs when they didn’t have any
in their game against Sweet Briar.

‘And he always cut the men’s
practices short so they could have
enough gym time. Besides, he really
wants to keep coaching. And he’s
really looking forward to giving his
famous locker room pep talks to get
those girls psyched up and ready to

go,’’ Walsh said.

Canfield, in an exclusive phone
interview, said that he is really look-
ing forward to the challenge of
coaching a new sport.

“IT am looking forward to this
new and interesting position. It
should present many challenges. And
the prospect of having these young
women around makes me feel differ-
ent already. I can’t explain how I
feel, but it is somewhat invigorating,
like I’m twenty years younger.’’
Canfield said.

Sophomore Courtney Smith, a
first-team All-American in club bas-
ketball, said that she has mixed emo-
tions about her new coach.

“‘T guess he’s better than nobody,
but I'd rather have the new lacrosse
coach, he’s a lot cuter.’’ Smith said.

Sources close to Canfield said that
he decided to resign after a long
telephone call with Washington and
Lee President John Wilson.

Apparently, a shouting match
erupted when Wilson accused Can-
field of using alumni funds targeted
for the Lenfest Center to buy cars for
recruits, thus delaying completion of
that building. Canfield was cleared by
the NCAA last year in a major inves-
tigation of the W&L sports program.

“This is truly the darkest day in

Junior Doug Brown fractured
his skull on Saturday at the Divi-
sion [I] National Swimming
Championships in Atlanta, Geor-

ia.

; Brown smashed into one end
of the pool during the next-to-
the-last lap in the finals of the
1,650-yard freestyle.

‘“‘T was going so fast that I
was unable to slow down and do
a flip turn,’’ Brown said. ‘‘My
head hit the wall and both my
arms flopped over onto the start-
ing block.’’

Random and _ unconfirmed
sources say Brown, wearing his
new football helmet, is back in
the water preparing for next sea-
son.

The men’s lacrosse team was
ranked sixth in Division III.

Juniors Marc Short and Andy
McGuire are set to go to Dallas,
Texas, this weekend for the 1991
conference on Politically Correct
Sportswriting.

Short, the keynote speaker,
will deliver a speech entitled

‘How To Make Preseason Predic-
tions When The Season Is Half
Over,’’ while McGuire will lead a
seminar called ‘‘Accurate Facts
and Correct Name Spelling: Who
Needs Them?’’

This year’s Kappa Alpha

Theta Triathalon will not include
the running and biking segments.
Instead, the combined mileage
from those two parts (18 miles)
will be added on to the half-mile
swim.
‘We want to keep the event
located in one place,’’ said a
Theta, who asked not to be
named. ‘‘Most of us are too lazy
to get up at 9 a.m. on a Sunday
morning and go stand on some
county road to show the runners
and bikers which way to go.”’

The entry fee is $25.00 per
person and all proceeds will go
toward Theta’s Spring Fling.

The Athletic Department has
added another class to its Spring
Term offerings. For $176.00 you
can learn to roller blade for cred-
it. The intensive six-week course
will culminate in a trip to the
Roller Derby Hall of Fame. En-
rollment is not limited, so just
show up at the gym sometime if
you are interested.

Faculty named in stud poll

Ring-tum Phi lists W&L’s top ten sexiest staff members

 

By Bambi Stark
Staff Table Hopper

 

In an effort to compete with the offerings of Playgirl and The Spectator,
The Ring-tum Phi recently polled Washington and Lee community women (and
interested men) for Lexington’s Top Ten Sexiest Faculty Members.

The lucky winners (pictured here) have been offered contracts to appear as
pin-up boys for a beef-cake calendar The Ring-tum Phi plans to offer. W&Ls
peer counselors will also get a break soon, because the local studmuffins have
offered to donate their time to help those in need.

Mr. November candidate Charles ‘‘Murph’’ Murray encourages all students
who need to talk, etc. to just call 1-SEXY-LEX-GUY. ‘‘I want to be your
friend,”’ he said.

University Treasurer Lawrence Broomall hopes proceeds from the phone
calls will be used to repay part of the university's debt as a result of the
Fraternity Renaissance program.

In the mean-time, watch for these area faves in the up-and-coming The
Making of The Ring-tum Phi Calendar swimsuit video on Channel Nine. The
show will be hosted by Reid Hall’s own Professor Robert de Maria.
