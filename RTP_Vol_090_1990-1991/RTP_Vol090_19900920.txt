VMI gives
list to city
for car tax

 

By Gregory Patterson
Staff Reporter

 

Virginia Military Institute has
agreed to turn over to Lexington a
list of cadets who have cars on cam-
pus so the city can tax the cars.

Meanwhile, a standoff continues
between the city and Washington and
Lee administrators, who still refuse
to submit a list of W&L student cars.

Lexington officials first asked the
colleges in February for the informa-
tion, which they plan to use to assess
car owners with personal property
tax — $5.50 for every $100 of as-
sessed value, Out-of-state students
who pay property tax on the cars in
their home state, however, would be
exempted.

Thomas Joynes, public information
officer at VMI, said VMI has agreed
to turn over the requested information
because the school is state-supported
and must comply with the requests of
other public entities.

“We're a public college and
they’re a public entity,’’ Joynes said.
‘All the lawyers say any public
institution has to provide requested
information to a public entity.’’

Lexington Commissioner of Rev-
enue Courtney Baker said the city
can tax student cars because of a
clause in the Virginia state code that
says personal property tax on cars
should be paid where the cars are
‘‘normally garaged and_ parked.’
Since the cars are in Lexington nine
months of the year the tax should be
paid here, Baker said.

The state attorncy general stated
that college students should pay the
tax to the town where the college is
located. Baker said the practice is not
uncommon -- Salem, Charlottesville
and Prince Edward’s County each tax
student cars.

“If a car is here, it’s here and
that’s where it should be taxed,”’
Baker said.

Baker said once she receives the
list of student cars from VMI she
will assess the value of each car and
the city treasurer will bill the owners.

W&L President John Wilson,
however, says he is still not willing
to give a similar list of W&L cars to
the city because he does not think
they have a right to the list and does
not think the tax would be worth the
effort for the city.

Wilson, in a March, 1990 letter to
then-city manager Joseph King, said
student automobile registration is a
part of the student’s record protected
by the 1974 Buckley Amendment.

The university is ‘‘constrained by
federal law to protect student records
from release to outside persons or
agencies without the permission of
the individual student,’’ Wilson wr-
ote.

Wilson also said students would
stop registering their cars with the
school or if the university began
turning over the list to the city. Stu-
dents might also seck ‘‘residential
space in the county, thus jeopardizing
our residential hall movement and our
desire to see more campus participa-
tion in co-curricular life,’’ he said.

Wilson also thinks the city has
overestimated the revenues it will
receive from taxing W&L cars. Wil-
son said 80 percent of W&L students
are from other states and have prob-
ably paid a personal property tax on
the vehicles. He said the tax is an
‘unwise course to invest in a tax-
collecting effort with such a small
number of potentially eligible tax
payers at stake.’’

Locals clash with students
during weekend festivities

 

By Cathy Lopiccolo
Assignment Editor

 

Violence last weekend between
Washington and Lee students and
Lexington residents has police, stu-
dents, and administrators worried
about student safety.

A group of men harassed W&L
students on Nelson Street Sunday
night, and another group of youths
raided a fraternity party Saturday
night injuring one woman, according
students and police.

Junior Macon Miles said eight
black men threw objects at him and
followed him as he left an apartment
near The Palms restaurant about
10:45 p.m. Sunday.

‘One of the guys put his foot in
the small of my back and shoved me,
and I tumed around and told them to
leave me alone,’’ Miles said. ‘‘A girl
in the Baptist Student Union heard
the noise and yelled out the window
at them. That really startled them, that
someone had seen them, so they kind
of backed off for a minute.”’

When Miles ran toward the Chi
Psi fraternity house, the men chased
him. Miles said the group stopped
following him when an unidentified
man on a bike rode up Lee Street.

The men ‘‘knocked him off the
bike. I tumed to see what they were
doing to him, but he had already
gotten back on his bike and rode
off,’’ Miles said.

Miles said he ran toward the
W&L campus and called police about
ten minutes later. Lexington Police
Chief Bruce Beard said an officer

was responding to another call from
a woman who complained about the
group of men at about the same time
Miles was harassed. The officer pur-
sued four or five youths on foot, but
was unable to catch them, Beard said.
Police have not made any arrests.

Dean of Students David Howison
said he had spoken to both Miles and
senior Bryant Spann, who was in-
volved in a similar incident Sunday.
Howison said he is working with
Lexington police and the campus
security staff to improve security.

“On incidents like this, close
cooperation between local police and
our own security staff is essential. I
expect the local police and security
will be more sensitive in the area
where these incidents occurred, espe-
cially in the next few days,’ How-
ison said.

Howison said students should
‘use common sense in their comings
and goings,’’ because no community
is free from crime. At Monday nig-
ht’s Executive Committee meeting,
President Tom Hatcher urged all
students to walk in groups if they
must walk in Lexington at night.
Miles said he plans to continue walk-
ing downtown as usual.

“I’m not going to let this affect
the way I live. It really disturbs me
to see people in Lexington that are
scared to go out by themselves or to
walk up the- Hil} at night. Things like
that shouldn’t happen in Lexington,”’
Miles said.

At the EC’s Tuesday night meet-
ing, Hatcher added that the EC is

EC considers new budget requests

 

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

 

Student Activities Board Chair-
woman Kathleen Duwel told _ the
Executive Committee Tuesday night
that she would consider moving the
Fancy Dress Ball to March 1.

FD is currently scheduled for
Friday, March 8, the day the Law
School spring holiday begins and the
second weekend after undergraduates
return from Washington holiday. EC
Secretary Jeffery Kelsey and Law
Reps. Mark Cobb and Giles Perkins

supported the idea to move FD to
increase Law School support for the
event.

Last year’s FD was also sched-
uled on the first day of Law School
spring holiday, but Kelsey said it
could not have been moved because
the gym was occupied the prior
weekend.

In response to SAB concerns that
the FD committee would only have
one week to prepare for the event,
Perkins and Kelsey said that law
students would be available and will-
ing to work while undergraduates
were away for Washington holiday.

The plausibility of moving Fancy
Dress will be decided within two
weeks, said EC President Tom Hat-
cher.

Duwel also announced that the
SAB plans to have open _ sign-ups
rather than an interview process for
the FD Committee in January.
Applicants will be asked to sign a
contract listing obligations to the FD
Committee and the consequent bene-
fits, such as a free ticket to the ball.

The main business of the EC this
week has been budget allocation
hearings. The Student Bar Associa-
tion made its requests first at Monday

night’s EC meeting, asking for more
than $40,000.

The SBA requests a budget for
almost all Law School organizations,
including publications and athletics,
and the three classes.

The organizations and classes
requested $91,984 from the SBA.
Their budget requests were cut to
$62,255, $40,839 of which the SBA
requested from the EC. The rest
will come primarily from SBA fees
at $51 per an estimated 386 law
students,

is interested in Delta Gamma, her university,
and wants to contribute to her university

‘‘numbers are not an issue.”’
Lambell said that although the number of
girls participating in the Rush may seem small
in comparison to the existing sororities on
campus,‘‘There’s no set number we’re looking
for here. Delta Gamma was started by three
women in 1873, I think they would be thrilled
with the women who were at the Open

IFC decries dirty rush, threatens punishment

 

By Jason Kelley
Senior Copy Editor

 

Be careful and be good were the messages
from Interfraternity Council President Goodloe
Lewis and Associate Dean of Students Buddy
Atkins at Tuesday night's IFC meeting.

The two criticized the use of dirty rush
tactics by some fraternity members over the
past few weeks, and they warned that houses
need to be particularly careful this weekend
during’ tear night activities.

‘Dirty rush is as much a rush violation as
a contact violation,’’ Lewis said. He prom-
ised that if any specific instances of dirty
rushing were brought to his attention, the IFC
would prosecute the offenders.

Atkins said, ‘‘I don’t think there’s a place
for that. I don’t think there’s an excuse for

that.’”’

Atkins said that houses need to emphasize
their own strong points rather than point out
others’ weaknesses.

‘*The standard, canned answer to a fresh
man who asks about another house should be
‘That's a fine house, but we’re better be-
cause...,’ ’’ he said.

John Flippen, President of Sigma Phi
Epsilon, said dirty rushing is not only bad for
the houses criticized, but also for the ones
who are doing the criticizing.

‘‘Most are complete lies. It really turns
freshmen off on your own house when you
say these things,’’ he said.

Pi Kappa Phi president Skip Sugarman

also spoke up, saying, ‘‘Dirty rush is just
wrong. I wouldn’t stand for it from any of
my guys.’’

Atkins warned fraternities that there are a

number of things that they need to be careful

of this weekend.

He said tear night activities must be kept
under control, and he advised houses to
celebrate in a mature, responsible way.

‘*Think about what you’re really celebrat-
ing on tear night. You're celebrating what is
essentially the first long-term decision that
this freshman has made without the influence
of his parents. This is one if his first steps
to real manhood,”’ he said,

‘‘If you celebrate that decision of his with
beer slides and mud-wrestling,’’ Atkins con
tinued, ‘‘that isn’t too far removed from the
sandbox. Don’t belittle his decision with chil
dish antics.’’

Atkins also told the fraternities not to
allow any local residents into parties. He said
a group has been trying to get into fraternity
parties and cause problems,

‘*These seem to be groups from Charlot
tesville and Roanoke that come

up here, get

together with all the local trouble-makers, and
then try to go out and hurt people,’’ he said.

He advised fraternity members to call the
police if they saw these people.

‘You won't be able to keep these people
out and you don’ t want to fight them because
you will lose,’’ he said, ‘‘Some of them don’t
know the difference between killing you and
saying hello.”’

Atkins said he believed some of the prob-
lems between the fraternities and group seem
to be racial, some may be caused by drugs.

Lewis said that his fraternity, Kappa

Sigma, had problems with this ‘‘gang’’ last
Saturday night.
Flippen, who is also the IFC's Public

Relations Chairman, passed out flyers to the
fraternity representatives that give advice on
how to ‘‘party smart’ in Lexington.

Lewis asked fraternity members to give
the flyers to people who come to parties at

their houses.

‘*Put them on girls’
have to,’’ he said.

The flyers advise girls to, among other
things, lock their purses in their trunks and
have someone walk them back to their cars
after parties,

“This is probably the best thing that the
IFC has done in all the years I’ve been
here,’’ said Atkins about the flyers.

Steven Mathis, the new president of Live
Drive, also addressed the council. He said
fraternities who are having large parties,
especially ones in the country, should get in
contact with Live Drive at least two weeks
before the party if they want shuttle service
to be provided.

He also reminded the that
every Friday and Saturday night people need
ing rides can call Live Drive and they will

Take me out
to the ballgame

The Washington and Lee Athletic Department has a
new toy this year, and it’s called the University
Athletics Promotion Committee. Its purpose? To get
you to come to a game every once in a while.
According to an article in last week’s Phi, the
committee is the brainchild of new Athletic Director
Mike Walsh.

No fool, Walsh has obviously noticed the habit we
have of attending only certain games. When we do go,
we're out of there by halftime. For example, about half
the crowd that was on hand for the Generals’ home
opener in football missed the exciting ending.

Local merchants, such as The Palms, Frank’s and the
University Bookstore will sponsor giveaways at halftime
of various events, in an attempt to force you to stay.
The theory is, if school spirit doesn’t compel you to
attend women’s soccer, free food might. If you read
carefully, you'll notice that each giveaway
announcement carries the famous phrase, ‘‘You must be
present to collect your prize.’’

The funny thing is, the athletic department shouldn’t
have to give away pizza to ensure fan support. Okay,
we admit it. Most of us have left during halftime, just
like everyone else. And, like everyone else, we have
missed some good games, matches, meets, etc., because
of it.

Yes, W&L is Division III, but that is not as much of
a liability as you might think. Although W&L will not
be in the Orange Bowl soon, that in no way takes
away from the competitiveness on the field. Also, these
are our friends out there. When you go to a W&L
sporting event, you will probably know most of the
players on our team. If you see George Sakin get
drilled on a safety blitz, you know he’ll be limping into
Journalism 201 on Monday.

Besides, Division III sports is probably the last
bastion of amateurism left these days. If you participate
in a varsity sport at W&L, you don’t do it because you
want to get drafted by the pros, or because that’s how

you can pay for school. You do it because you love the
game, and that’s what sport used to be all about, back
in the Dark Ages.

Give it a chance. You might even enjoy taking in a
game or two.

To our readers

Okay, we’re going to try this one more time. Once
again, the call goes out: contribute to the Opinion page
of the Phi. You can be serious, funny, irreverent,
repulsive (at least to a point), or sad. Deep in your
heart, you must believe that you can write better than
any of us clowns on the Phi staff. So, prove it.

We welcome, indeed crave, your submissions.

Dance, laugh, and be merry. Remember, life’s too short for
hassles.

MY VIEW
By Chris Baradel

 

Just a few random musings,
thoughts, ideas and opinions about
some of the events going on here at
Washington and Lee and in the world
beyond---Let’s start by reiterating the
fact that if people would start turning
in My Yiews, I wouldn’t have to do
this---Doesn’t it just warm your heart
to know that poor old Marion Barry
won’t have to go through another tri-
al? It seems to me that if that man
can squirm his way out of 13 of the
14 indictments against him, despite
the testimony of a phalanx of wit-
nesses who testified under oath that
they had seen Barry use drugs over
200 times combined, maybe someth-
ing is wrong with the criminal justice
system. Wonder how the Colombian
people feel about the fact that their
judges, elected officials and innocent
citizens are being assassinated in their
fight against the drug cartels, all so
that the people of D.C. can watch
Marion smoking a crack pipe and
then basically let him off scot-free?-

--Based on the evidence of the first
two games, it appears that the W&L
football has got the kind of defense
that could carry them to a very suc-
cessful season---I don’t see how we
can stave off war much longer in the
Persian Gulf, and believe me, those
Iraqis are going to be what is known
as ‘‘a tough proposition’’---I haven’t
heard a bad thing said about our new
Dean of Students, David Howison,
yet---I couldn’t believe Larry King
said that Miss Pennsylvania (of the
Miss America Pageant) was uglier
than her ventriloquist dummy. As if
he isn’t captain of the All-Ugly team-
--The only suspense left in the Oak-
land A’s assault on the World Series
is whether anybody will be able to
steal a game from them in the post-
season. Boston, with a healthy Roger

Clemens on the mound would have

the best shot of vanquishing the A’s
in any one game, but nobody is
going to be able to keep them away
from a repeat title. As they stand
now, they are undoubtedly the best
baseball team of our generation, so
appreciate them for their greatness
before they break apart---When is
Lindy Felix, the ‘‘massage therapist,”’

going to open up shop in Lexington?-
--Congratulations are in order for the
many Atlantans here, as their home
city was selected to be the site for
the 1996 Summer Olympic Games--
-Supreme Court nominee David So-
uter can’t be anything but ecstatic
about the way his Senate confirma-
tion hearings have gone thus far. He
seems to be locked into a seat on the
Court---It’s sick that Blake Comer is
out of jail and lounging comfortably
at home already, after serving just
slightly more than two months in
prison. What kind of example does
that set for those who might be temp-
ted to act as he did? And Judge
Bumgardner was complaining about
W&L’s ‘‘uncontrolled environment’’-
--Ty Detmer is the best player in
college football right now. That the
guy could throw for well over 400
yards against the University of Mi-
ami, when he has a set of receivers
that could barely out-run the Hurri-
canes coach (much less their second-
ary), and follow that up by leading
his team to score 36 fourth-quarter
points in a come-from-behind triumph
the next week says to me that no one
does it better. If he doesn’t bring the

Heisman to Provo, the Mormon Tab-,
ernacle Choir ought to start singing
the blues---It’s a mystery to me why’
these gangs that supposedly converge,
on Lexington from Roanoke and
Richmond waste their time here.‘
Aren’t there enough placesto get in,
trouble where they’re from?---Finally,
it wouldn’t be possible to avoid com-'
menting on the cavalier attitude W&L,
students seem to have regarding
drinking and driving. What does it'
take to get people to realize that,
people get hurt and, yes, killed that
way? One would have thought that’
the students here would have learned,
that terrible lesson from the Blake
Comer incident, but no. Yet another‘
W&L student awaits his trial on,
charges of driving under the influence
of alcohol, after an accident that put'
his»friendin ‘the’ hospital. Most ‘pre-
posterous of all, she defended ‘him,
saying that it ‘‘wasn’t his fault.’’ I'
can understand that she would feel,
loyalty toward her friend, but come
on! It’s time for us to start holding:
people accountable for their actions, ,
especially when these actions are
reckless and put innocent people at’
risk.

Theory and reality in Rush

 

MY VIEW
By Brian Root

 

Freshmen at Washington and Lee learn quickly
the dramatic difference between theory and reality.

Freshmen learn about theory first, during
Freshman Orientation. Soon after arriving in
Lexington, the school makes a great effort to
expose them to the Honor System, and all that it
entails.

Thus indoctrinated, they enter Rush, and that’s
when they learn about reality. Reality is dirty rush.

Almost every rushee has a story to tell, and
they all are basically the same. A freshman is at
a house, where a fraternity member asks him what
other fraternities he is considering and then pro-
ceeds to insult each fraternity named.

Where is the honor here? The answer is simple,
there is none. It has been said innumerable times
that Robert E. Lee asked only that students behave
as gentlemen. I see little evidence of that rule
being obeyed now.

Time to take
responsiblity

Just when you thought you had seen it
all....‘‘It wasn’t like it was Brandon’s fault, those
country roads can be really dangerous,’’ I’m
simply amazed that Elizabeth Hancock can so
defensively state that Brandon Greene was a
victim of circumstances beyond his control. Per-
haps that country road wouidn’t have been so
threatening if he wasn’t ‘‘allegedly under the in-
fluence of alcohol.’’ Perhaps he wouldn’t have
been following the ‘‘lead car,’’ causing blindness
from the dust and gravel if he had been in better
control of himself. | wonder who would be to
blame if someone had been killed. Most of all, I
am saddened that such an incident is ‘‘hot potat-
oed’’ out of the hands of those students and into
the hands of the world around them. I suggest
they take a good look at themselves and start
taking some responsibility for their actions. I am
appalled that in this day of awareness, ‘‘intel-
ligent’’ people refuse to consider the consequen-
ces of drinking and driving.

 

IFC President Goodloe Lewis reminded the
houses that dirty rushing is ‘‘as much a rush
violation as a contact violation.’’ I think he’s
missing the point somewhat.

To attempt to classify dirty rushing as an
honor-related matter is, to say the least, complicat-
ed.

 

Without knowing it, W&L’s
fraternities may now be their
own worst enemies.

 

Nevertheless, I believe the proper punishment
for intentionally deceiving another student about
fraternities or their members should be more than
a $500 fine.

As has been noted previously, fraternity Rush
is now a very intense time, for both fraternities
and freshmen. The pressure to succeed during Rush
is possibly greater now than it ever has been,
because of the impending financial crunch facing

Visitor Center
falls prey
to vandalism

This letter is about the vandalism at the Lex-
ington Visitor’s Center, on Washington Street. It
happened happened Friday, Saturday and Sunday
nights.

‘The Lexington Visitor Center spends time,
energy and money making visitors feel welcome
in Our community, so that they will spend their
time, energy and money here. What we do may
seem frivolous to some, but it helps to keep
businesses in business, people working and mon-
ey flowing around the community.

many of W&L’s 16 fraternities.

It seems odd that fraternities, organizations that ,
for so long have been the primary promoters of
“‘tradition’’ at W&L, almost routinely ignore the.
principle of gentlemanly behavior during Rush,
regarding their treatment of other houses. ’

The competition now is already intense, and
does not need to be made more so by spreading '
rumors designed to deceive a rushee.

Fraternities have long known that, however
imperfect the present system of regulation may be, +
further regulation and restriction by the Hill would
be far worse. ;

However, that holds true only if the fraternities ,
can effectively police themselves.

Without knowing it, W&L’s fraternities may .
now be their own worst enemies.

The Greek system at W&L has much to offer ‘
to the community, and particularly freshmen. |
Membership in a fraternity is one of the best
investments a student can make at W&L.

The problem is, rushees won’t learn that if all
they hear during Rush is how bad another house ‘
is.

When we moved into the new Visitor Center
two years ago, we were not able to fund a
beautiful landscaping project in front. We have
made do with barrells of flowers, and a couple
of planters full of welcoming plants. Even this
costs money, but it does show visitors that the
people of our community care about our town.

This is the fourth time this season the vandals |,
have struck the planters and destroyed a good
many of the flowers. I have always had a hard
time understanding what fun this kind of destruc-
tion is for someone, but it happens over and
over.

These flowers not only welcome visitors, they
provide beauty to those of us who live here and
those that go by the Visitor Center. I am not
blaming students at W&L or their guests. If any-
one sees vandals doing their ‘‘thing,’’ please call
the police. In the long run, it will save tax dol-
lars. In the short run, you will be doing the right
thing.

Sincerely,
Martha M. Doss, Director
Lexington Visitors Bureau

Shillington,
Leslie look
to future

 

By Alisann McGloin

Two of Washington and Lee’s
faculty, despite serious illnesses last
year, are recovering well.

Coach Emmett ‘‘Buck’’ Leslie,
who was diagnosed with leukemia
last January, is back teaching and
coaching golf this term. Although he
is not working out as much as he
prefers, he said he plans to take
things slowly rather than jumping
right back into his normal routine.
While Leslie said his endurance is
not what it used to be, his health is
improving.

Since March, Leslie had been
undergoing a treatment successful in
England. He has been able to forego
the final step of the treatment because
his sickness was brought ‘‘under con-
trol.’’

Leslie’s doctor at Roanoke Reha-
bilitation Center gave Leslie a good
report at his last visit so his biweekly
visits have been cut to a visit every
three weeks.

“Every day is a new thrill. It’s
great to be back,’”’ Leslie said.

Chemistry Department Dr. J.
Keith Shillington, who had a stroke
last January, returned to his home
just before this term began.

Dr. William Watt, also of the
chemistry department, said while Dr.
Shillington’s left arm is still para-
lyzed and he has difficulty walking,
‘the walks some every day.’’ Work-
ing with his nurse, Shillington prac-
tices with a walker as much as possi-
ble.

According to W&L senior Katie
Duwell who has been helping him
with the groceries, Shillington ‘‘ is
managing to lead a pretty normal life
under the circumstances.’’

“It’s not easy but he still has a
lot of spirit,’’ Duwell said.

Shillington is looking forward to
Homecoming. ‘‘Right now, more than
anything, his short-term goal is to be
able to kiss the homecoming queen,”’
Duwell said.

 

VIOLENCE

from page 1

drafting a letter to Beard, informing
him of students’ concerns, and asked
that any student involved in a similar
encounter contact the EC so the letter
can include details of specific inci-
dents.

Saturday night, about 8 to 12 men
“‘muscled their way’’ into a Kappa
Sigma party, according to Alex Hitz.

‘‘They came to the door and said
they were friends of the band, which
they weren’t. Once they got in, they
started throwing their weight around
and ended up getting pretty violent,”’
Hitz said. Hitz said he thought the
men might have been members of a
gang.

Beard said the police reported the
incident as assault and battery. Beard

said Tiffani Board, a student from
Hollins College, was struck by a beer
can and treated at Stonewall Jackson
Hospital emergency room for lacera-
tions on her lower lip. Although the
officers made no arrests Saturday
night, Beard said there are suspects
and the police department is inves-
tigating both the assault and battery
and trespassing charges.
“‘Apparently, the majority of the
locals had run out of the fraternity
house by the time the officers got
there. The police were not totally
aware of what was going on, so they
went straight inside, but the youths
had all cleared out,’’ Beard said.
Hitz said at least some of the
youths were still in the house when

police arrived, and he thinks the
officers should have made arrests at
that time.

“‘The guys were on their way out
the door when the police got there.
They just told the guys to go home
and go to bed,”’ Hitz said.

Beard said he didn’t know if the
incidents Saturday and Sunday nights
were related and attributed them to
the large number of rush parties last
weekend.

“I hope it was a one-time
happening, but we never can predict
things like this,’’ Beard said.

Beard said his office has inves-
tigated violence between youth groups
from Lexington and Buena Vista, but
that he does not think of them as

‘*gangs.”’

“I don’t think that’s the right
word. They might like you to call
them that, but I just think they’re
youths with too much leisure time,’’
Beard said.

Beard met this afternoon with
members of the student body as part
of a Community Partnership Program
between the police department and
the university. Beard says he usually
meets with some fraterrity presidents,
members of the Interfraternity Coun-
cil and sometimes administrators to
exchange ideas.

‘‘Hopefully the students can give
us any ideas they have, and we can
make some suggestions about how to
party more safely,’’ Beard said.

DC spring: Look, learn

 

By Matthew Jackson
Staff Reporter

 

Interning for a U.S. Senator or
Representative as part of the Wash-
ington Term Program rewards stu-
dents with six political science
credits, a deeper understanding of the
federal government and the practical
experience of working for a national
lawmaker.

During spring term, _ selected
scholars live in Washington, D.C.
while attending a weekly seminar and
lecture series, accomplishing academic
work including a detailed journal and
a paper and serving a four-day-per-
week internship.

In order to experience the six-
week program, students must meet
certain requirements. The completion
of Politics 101, 102 or 111 with at
least a 3.0 grade point average en-
ables a student to apply. After ar

interview, the Department of Politics
relies on evidence of interest, acade-
mic record and personal qualifica-
tions to influence its decisions.

Although freshmen may apply, the
program prefers upperclassmen. Ac-
cording to Professor William F, Con-
nelly, Jr., the program’s resident
director, mostly sophomores and
juniors attend. Scholars concentrating
in a major other than political science
share an equal opportunity for selec-
tion as those who major in politics.

Fifteen W&L students, including
one freshman, 13 sophomores and
juniors and one senior, participated
last year.

Senior John Buchanan, who spent
last spring in Washington, said, ‘‘Be-
ing on the inside, even though we
weren’t doing extremely important
work, was a big advantage. We had
great opportunities like attending
hearings, committee meetings and
mark-ups.”’

Professor Connelly added, ‘‘Al-

though routine intern work may seem
boring, that’s the price to be paid to
gain more substance of respon-
sibility.” The increase of respon-
sibility may include speech and letter
writing as well as attending hearings
and other sessions.

The course emphasizes a wide
range of activities for the interns
including the viewing of house and
senate debates. The program stresses
participant observation.

‘T want each scholar to ‘soak and
poke,’ to gain insight of the func-
tions of Congress and to learn their
way around the Capitol complex
through active participation,’’ Con-
nelly said.

Students can obtain applications
and course prospectuses from Profes-
sor Connelly in room 108 of the C-
School. Office hours are 10-11 a.m.
on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays
and 3-4 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thu-
rsdays.

Offices to fill game room

 

By Macon Miles
Staff Reporter

 

The game room in the University
Center is closed this year and will be
renovated this fall in order to house
new student offices, according to
Assistant Dean of Students Leroy
‘*Buddy”’ Atkins.

‘‘The game room wasn’t being
used to its fullest potential,’’ said
University Center Manager Carol
‘Caulkins.

The International House was
moved into the Lee House this year,
and several student organizations lost
their offices. These organizations will

move into the new offices.

According to Dean Atkins, there
will be either five or six offices,
depending on whether the Dining
Hall relocates one of its storage
rooms. The organizations that are
scheduled to move into these offices
are Alpha Phi Omega, Contact, the
Independent Union, and the College
Republicans. There may be room for
other student organizations, according
to Caulkins, but no plans are definite
at this time.

The plans for the renovations
include a common meeting room
which will be surrounded by the
offices. All the organizations in the
new offices are to share this room for

their meetings. This experimental
arrangement is a new concept for the
student center according to Caulkins.

Frank Parsons, Coordinator of
Capital Planning, said that there are
no definite plans for moving the
student offices into the old game
room, however.

The estimated cost for the renova-
tions is $19,000. Renovation was to
start over the summer, but it was
delayed because PiKA was originally
scheduled to hold formal Rush in the
game room. Buildings and Grounds
stated that this is their next major
project and that they will start work
early this fall. The renovations will
be completed by the end of this term.

 

BUDGET

from page 1

SBA President Grant Bums em-
phasized that the most significant
budget adjustments were the elimina-
tion and consolidation of parties.
The social fund received the largest
cut of $6,250, and the first and
second-year class budgets were cut
almost $2,900.

The SBA received $35,000 of
their $37,503.13 request last year.

The Contact Committee appeared
before the EC Tuesday night with a
request for $21,000, $3,000 more
than last year’s allocation and
$1,000 more than last year’s request.

A more active schedule and high-
er speaking fees are the reason for
Contact’s proposed increase, accord-
ing to their report.

Contact Chairman Charles Kranich
told the EC that Contact plans to
request $13,000 from the Interfrater-
nity Council, the same amount the
IFC granted last year. Kranich said
that the IFC granted last year’s
$4,000 increase over 1988-89 with
“‘controversy,’’ and Contact would
not ask for another increase.

The Ring-tum Phi presented a
budget request for $15,600 Tuesday
night, which raised many questions
from the EC.

The Phi anticipates $18,000 in
advertising and subscription revenue,
versus $33,600 in expenses.

The newspaper received all of its
$14,600 request for 1989-90. Ac-

cording to EC Vice President Ray-
mond Welder, a remainder of
$5,303.91 was tumed into the Publi-
cations Board account at the end of
the last academic year, as per stan-
dard procedure.

‘‘Last year we cut back because
of the SAB,’’ explained Phi Busi-
ness Manager Anne Dysart. ‘‘We’re
asking for more money this year.”

Welder said that according to
Business Office records, the Phi
generated just over $22,000 in reve-
nue last year. Dysart responded that
last year was ‘‘a fluke’’ in advertis-
ing, and $18,000 remains a reason-
able projection for 1990-91.

In response to questions about
salaried Phi circulation personnel,
Dysart told the EC that after they are
familiar with their jobs they work an
average of three hours per week.
After the Phi’s budget hearing, Weld-
er noted that three persons employed
for three hours per week at $6 per
hour for 30 weeks totaled an expen-
diture of $1,620, less than the
$3,000 requested for those salaries.

Several EC members said they
were confused about the Publications
Board budget and money the board
recieved from the 1989-90 Phi.

Welder said that the EC does not
grant money to the board, but Busi-
ness Office records show the board
starting fall 1989 with $8,000 and
ending spring 1990 with $4,951,

 

 

before the Phi remainder was trans-
ferred. Hatcher instructed Welder to
determine the source of the board’s
budget and report back to the EC.

Director of Communications and
member of the Publications Board
Brian Shaw said yesterday that ‘*The
Pub Board gets its funding from the
efficient management of _pub-
lications,”’ meaning savings such as
that of the Phi from 1989-90.

Budget hearings continue tonight
from 7-9 p.m. and conclude tomor-
row night from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m.,:
when SAB will present. Over the
next two weeks the EC will deliber-
ate and make allocations from the
more than $185,000 expected in
student activities fees. All budget
hearings and deliberations are open
to the student body.

The EC held closed interviews
last night for the positions of Stu-
dent Activities Board operations di-
rector and Law School publicity
representative; Fancy Dress chairman,
vice chairman and auditor; and Mock
Convention secretary.

Petition forms to run for fresh-
men EC representative will be avail-
able in the University Center on
Monday, due Oct. 1 for an Oct. 8
election.

Newly elected first-year law Rep.

Daniel Munroe joined the EC Tues-
day night.

W&L wins
third by
' ghut out

By John Laney
‘Associate Sports Editor

¥

, The Washington and Lee women’s
Soccer team keeps rolling along.

« The Generals continued their
unbeaten and unscored w start by
defeating Guilford 1-0 this past Satur-
day at Liberty Hall Field.

W&L launched 27 shots at the
suilford goal, and the one that nes-
tled into the back of the net was
€nough for the Generals’ third
straight win.

With just over seven minutes
kemaining in the match, freshman
forward Karen Stutzmann found her-
Self in a race to the ball with the
Guilford goalie. Stutzmann got to it
first and her shot deflected off of the
Boalie and into the goal.

“She had many opportunities to
Score on Saturday. I knew she was
going to convert one if not more,”
head coach Janine Hathom said of
Stutzmann. ‘‘She’s one of the more
critical forwards we have on the
feam.”’

» The Generals’ chance to take a
lead five minutes into the first half
was turned away when junior mid-
fielder Ann Shaughnessy’s penalty
kick was blocked.

+ ‘I think we got a little nervous
‘after that,’’ Hathorn said. ‘‘We
thought we should have scored.’’

» According to Hathom, W&L
played well, but nervously against
Guilford.

“‘We came out like a storm and
we were doing all the right things,”’
She said. ‘‘But we petered out after
15 minutes and then the game be-
came frenzied and turned more into
Kickball than soccer for the rest of
the first half.

“The feeling of being in synch i is
fiot quite there yet. I think we’re still
tyying to find the right rhythm, but I
think we are another step down the
Yoad to playing the type of soccer we
want to play,’’ Hathorn added.

goalkeeper Katie Stimeling made
eight saves on the afternoon as she
eared her third consecutive shutout.
Stimeling has collected 19 saves so
far this season.

“{Stimeling] is an_ incredible
player and she’s very athletic. She
could start as a field player for any |
other team,’’ Hathorm said.

W&L’s three victories have come
on just four goals and Hathorn said
she is concerned that the team is not
able to convert more of its shots.

Defense comes

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

« 1989 was Methodist College’s
first year of college football. When
fhe Monarchs came to Lexington last
year, Washington and Lee trounced
them 47-0.

‘So naturally, when the Generals
travelled to Methodist this year, many
expected much of the same.

* But the 1990 version of the Meth-
edist Monarchs was nothing like the
1989 version. And if not for the play
‘of the W&L defense, the Generals
snight not have escaped North Caroli-
na with a 10-0 win.

In 1989, the Monarchs got one

equal that feat. Starting from their
21, the Monarchs drove to the W&L
43 before stalling.

On second down and 18, junior
nose guard Greg Kiehl sacked Mon-
arch quarterback Robby Barnhill for
a loss of eight. On the next play,
sophomore comerback Don Dempsey
broke up a pass with a vicious hit,
forcing a Methodist punt.

‘Our number one focus is putting
the ball in the goal. We need to
deflect the ball more to beat goal-
tenders. We’ve had some incredible
scoring opportunities,’’ Hathorn said.

The Generals play at Virginia

Cross country sprints to wins

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

The Washington and Lee cross
country teams have the theory of
natural progression on their side this
year. Each of the past two years, the
teams have improved one place in the
final standings, and last year, the
teams each finished second in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference Cham-
pionships.

And to start the 1990 season last
Saturday, both the men and the wom-
en made it known early that they are
making serious runs toward the
ODAC titles.

The women’s team started the
season against ODAC rivals Eastern
Mennonite and Bridgewater in a meet
at EMC. Led by seniors Shawn
Wert and Cecily Tynan, the Generals
won the meet, besting EMC 23-35
and Bridgewater by 23-91. The win
over EMC was the team’s first ever.

Wert finished second overall, and
the Generals placed five runners in

. ning 16-47.

the top seven and six in the top 10
to take the win. Sophomore Susie
Wootton, senior Pat Lopes and junior
Brannon Aden rounded out the top
five W&L finishers.

It was the first time that Wert had
ever finished ahead of Tynan when
the two have run together. Said head
coach Jim Phemister, ‘‘The top five
runners finished within 1:40 of each
other. It was one of our tightest
finishes ever.

“‘Our times on this course in our
first meet are on a par with the times
we had at Eastern Mennonite two
years ago in the ODAC finals.’’

The men, led by junior Charles
Tdwards, ran away from EMC, win-
Bridgewater was for-
feited.

The Generals swept the top four
spots, led by Edwards’ time of 26:27
and had seven of the top eight finish-

ers. Sophomore Bo Hannah finished ©

second while running a personal best
26:46. Junior Lee Parker finished
third despite falling once, and class-
mate David Martin finished fourth.

Sophomore Keith Dunn finished
sixth overall, followed by junior
David Phillips and senior Kennon
Walthall. Phillips ran a personal best
28:24.

Parker fell down while running
through some construction material on
the course, and Martin finished in
27:39 despite stopping to tie his shoc.

“I’m really thrilled that we started
off so well with two guys running
well under 27:00,’’ said head coach
John Tucker. ‘‘But I’m a little
scared that we may have started too
well and set too high a standard for
the rest of the year.’’

Both W&L teams will put their 2-

0 records on the line this Saturday
with the women hosting Mary Wash-
ington and the men hosting Washing-
ton College along with Mary Wash-
ington.

Said Tucker, ‘‘Mary Washington
has what may be their best team
ever. But I think our guys can run
with them.”’

Heading into this past Saturday’s
water polo game against Princeton,
seventh-seeded Washington and Lee
needed a victory to remain among the
top eight at the South Varsity Invita-
tional.

Although the Generals lost that
game, they returned to win their next
three games, finishing ninth at the
tournament.

At the weekend-long invitational,
held in Annapolis, Md., W&L won
the ninth-place game over Richmond
after winning back-to-back games on
Saturday. The strong finish puts the
Generals into the top bracket for the
North Varsity Invitational next month.

Princeton topped the Generals 14-

9, and head coach Page Remillard
said it took awhile for the team to
come together.

*‘[Princeton] was very fast and
very skilled. That and the fact that it
was our first game was too much to
overcome,”’ he said.

Against MIT, W&L emerged from
the water with an 11-5 win.

‘That was an important game for
both teams,’’ Resnillard said. ‘‘We
just got on a roll.”

Next up was Dayton. The Gen-
erals beat the Flyers 13-6 to reach
the ninth-place game and a date with
arch-rival Richmond.

In the game against Richmond,
who dominated W&L in a scrimmage
at the end of the preseason, the Spid-
ers held a three-goal advantage before
the Generals came back to lead by
three. Richmond scored two late

goals to provide the final margin of
11-10.

In the invitational, sophomore
Scott Strader, who led W&L in goals
scored per game last season, scored
eight goals. Following him were
junior Will Davis and senior Tomas
Perez with six goals apiece and sen-
ior Jim Dunlevy and freshman Greg
Golub, each with five goals. Sopho-
more goalkeeper P.J. Waicus made 22
saves with a goals per game average
of 9.25.

This weekend W&L will journey
east to defend their state champion-
ship at the Virginia State Champion-
ships in Richmond. W&L will be
joined by Lynchburg, Hampden-Syd-
ney, Mary Washington and Richmond
in the competition. W&L is seeded
second behind Richmond.

up big in 10-0 win at Methodist

On W&L’s first possession, the
offense showed signs of life before
committing the first of six turnovers
on the day. Junior quarterback
George Sakin hit senior Craig Irons
on a third down play for a gain of
11 yards and a first down at the
Methodist 49, but three plays later,
senior Mason Pope fumbled and the
Monarchs recovered.

The W&L defense caused a turn-
over late in the first quarter, setting
up the offense’s first sustained drive.
Kiehl and sophomore Phil Spears
stripped Barnhill and junior defensive
end John McCallum recovered at the
W&L 27.

The offense then drove to the

Soccer finds turf
tough in two losses

 

By John Laney
Associate Sports Editor

 

After coming off two season-
opening victories, the Washinton and
Lee men’s soccer team fell to Johns
Hopkins and Carnegie-Mellon in
Pittsburgh, Pa., this past weekend.

The Generals lost to Camegie-
Mellon 2-1 on Saturday and Johns
Hopkins 5-1 on Sunday. Both games,
played on AstroTurf, were hosted by
Carnegie-Mellon.

“‘We were manhandled and physi-
cally outfought,’’ said head coach
Rolf Piranian. ‘‘Saturday, we at least
were in the game, but on Sunday we
were totally out of it, period. It was
a disappointing weekend.’’

The game against Hopkins on
Saturday was scoreless at the half.
With 15 minutes gone in the second
half, a crossing pass from the left
side that was redirected into goal
gave Hopkins a 1-0 lead.

W&L evened the score with about
20 minutes remaining when sopho-
more forward Reid Murphy scored
after a one-on-one encounter with
Hopkin’s goaltender. Hopkin’s one-
goal margin of victory came after a

free kick from 22 yards out resulted
in a goal.

On a rainy and cold Sunday after-
noon, Camegie-Mellon scored within
the first five minutes. W&L scored
its goal shortly thereafter when fresh-
man midfielder Dan Rhodes knocked
a bouncing ball from the front of the
goal into the back of the net. Soph-
omore midfielder Mike Mitchem was
credited with an assist on the play.

The tie game was short lived,
though, as Carnegie-Mellon scored
again to go up 2-1. Two more goals,
each within the final five minutes of
the half, gave Carnegie-Mellon a 4-
1 halftime lead.

Beginning Saturday, W&L will
play three games in five days. The
Generals will begin their Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference schedule at
Roanoke on Saturday, will have their
home-opener against Guilford on
Monday and will head north to Shen-
andoah on Wednesday.

“‘We’re not looking beyond Ro-
anoke,”’ Piranian said. ‘‘People may
tend to put us on the shelf after this
weekend, but one day doesn’t make
a season. We’re a team that will be
back in full force.’’

bay by the W&L defense as well,
making only one other sustained drive
in the game.

After recovering a W&L fumble,
the Monarchs drove to the W&L 32
where they faced a fourth and one.
As Barnhill started to roll out, sopho-
more linebacker Paul Mallos made
the biggest play of the game, sacking
Barnhill for a 14 yard loss. Said
Spears, ‘‘The ‘Red Sea’ parted, and
Paul made the play.’’

Sakin then marched the offense
downfield, getting big plays from
junior Jeff Kreis and Pope to get to
the Methodist three, where Pope
followed the blocks of seniors Tyler
Suiters, Rob Roberton and Rob Chris-
tensen and 6-6 260-pound sophomore
defensive tackle/goal line fullback
Thomas May into the end zone for a
10-0 W&L win.

Said senior tri-captain Clark
Wight, ‘‘The defense really reacted
well all day long after turnover. We
kept up our intensity and heart and
got the job done. We had a great
team effort. Everybody played
well,”’

McCallum made 17 tackles, and
three tackles for losses, recovered two
fumbles and was named Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference Defensive
Player of the Week. Mallos made 13
tackles, registered a sack and had an

Although the Generals came away
with a win to even their record at 1-
1, the team suffered a tremendous
loss. In the second quarter, Kiehl
saw his season come to an end when
he broke his leg. The all-ODAC nose
guard had surgery to put a plate on
his leg Sunday and is out for the
season.

This week, the Generals will travel

Generals win R-MWC
tourney, top Concord

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

The Washington and Lee volley-
bail team recovered from some first-
week injuries to take the Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College Tournament
championship for the third straight
year, highlighting a week that saw
the Generals lose only once.

After splitting six matches in the
Haverford Tournament to start the
year without the services of senior
Lisa Jay and junior Mena McGowin
for several games, the Generals were
glad to see the two team leaders
return.

W&L rolled through the R-MWC
tournament field, getting contributions
from the whole team, before facing a
tough Meredith team in the finals.
The Generals fell behind but rallied
to take the title.

Although the results of the tourna-
ment do not count toward W&L’s
overall record, the Generals were
feeling confident when they traveled
to West Virginia to take on Bluefield
and Concord.

With a healthy team, W&L forced
Bluefield to three games before fall-
ing 15-11, 10-15, 15-5. In the night-
cap, against Concord, the Generals

A healthy McGowin teamed with
sophomore Leslie Hess tg lead the
Generals’ attack. Each répistered 21

team’s quarterback, handed out 48

Profs’ offices have personality

 

By Ashley Harper
Entertainment Editor

 

Whether Washington and Lee’s
faculty offices are filled with element
charts, skeletons, thousands of com-
pact discs, books, maps or artifacts,
€ach one is unique and has a story
to tell.

As nervous accounting students
enter Associate Professor of Account-
ing Lyn F. Wheeler’s office in the
Commerce school, they might not
notice the collection of over 150 toys
which line his book shelves.

Wheeler said, ‘‘Toys are more
reflective than you would think, eco-
nomically speaking. I think the level
of the toy satisfaction reflects well
the country’s economy.

“I moved to the capital of Malay-
Sia to teach for a year. While I was
there I realized the world of toys is
changing to plastic and Nintendo.
There aren’t any real toys anymore.
My interest in toys got me to go
places.’’

Wheeler spent nine weeks in
Saigon, where they sell only hand
made toys, such as the airplane made
out of Coca-cola and Heinekin cans
in his collection. While in Burma,
Wheeler found only primitive wooden
toys. These toys are the best these
areas can produce, he said.

The Eastern Block toys, such as
those from the USSR, are heavy and
bulky. However, in Czechoslovakia
the toys are more advanced. East
German stores will only buy West
German toys even though no one can
afford to purchase them. Egypt man-
ufactures no toys; they are all made
in other countries, Wheeler said.

Other toys in his collection in-
clude dump trucks, trains, double
decker buses, horses and _ tankers,
flying toys, noisy toys end many
others.

When asked about how he started
his collection, Wheeler said it wasn’t
intended to be a collection. It is a
hobby he acquired.

Wheeler said, ‘‘It is not important
what your hobby is, but thai you
have it. Hobbies make you more
interested, not more interesting.”’

Professor of Politics Craig W.
| McCaughrin recalled a few years ago
when he came to his office to do
work on a Saturday and found some-

 
    

  

one preparing for a debate in his
office. The student said, ‘‘I’m sorry,
I just wanted to find an empty room
to practice in.’’

It may be a bit shocking when
you first enter McCaughrin’s office,
but it is an office. Every one of his
besk shelves, his desk and all his
counter space are completely empty.
Some may think he hasn’t settled into
his office yet, but it has remained
empty ever since he came to W&L
ten years ago.

McCaughrin has the few books he
needs in his office behind cabinet
doors. These are only the books he
will use for the entire year and the
books he is reading in order to write
reviews for the six different journals
he submits to.

McCaughrin said,‘‘In teaching, I
believe in varying the medium such
as with video tape, computers, films
and speakers instead of just reading
out of a textbook.

“I remember as a student myself,
I had a very short attention span.
The class that kept my attention was
the one which had variety. Can you
imagine a 15 week or even year long
course, in some cases, that doesn’t
vary from the textbook?’’

Even at home, the few books on
his shelves belong mostly his wife,
Russian instructor Greta McCaughrin.
McCaughrin said the C-school jan-
itors tell him that his is their favorite
office to work in.

McCaughrin said he always laughs
when he thinks of a period during an
office scramble in the C-school. All
the other Political Science professors’
offices were located upstairs. When
asked if he would like join the rest
of his department, the person said,
‘Would you like to move to another
office? You won’t have much trouble
moving your books upstairs.”’

In Robinson Hall, Professor of
Mathematics Thomas O. Vinson
proudly displays an Elvis lamp in his
office.Vinson said, ‘‘i have always
admired the King up through movies
like Love Me Tender and Blue Haw-
ati: My wife bought the lamp for my
birthday.”’

Although the Elvis lamp may be
the prominent article in his office,
Vinson has much more in store. He
has funny pictures hanging on his
bulletin board, as well as a present
from his son’s friend, a sumo wres-

Penh

tling calendar.

One of Vinson’s oldest novelties
is an electric rolling ocean scene
valued around $250. Vinson said,
“You wouldn’t think something so
tacky would cost so much. I found
this one in my wife’s mother’s attic.’’

Associate Accounting Professor J.
Kevin Green has moved into a new
office, adding an oriental rug and
comfortable chairs.

Green said that he didn’t expect
reactions from other faculty members.
Green said, ‘‘I have never cared
much for sitting behind a desk to talk
to someone on the other side of a

 

desk. I am more comfortable talking
in a situction like this.”’

The living room aura surrounding
this part of the old C-school study
lounge was created by his wife, and
interior decorator. The office is still
not complete, however. Green’s
WWII American and British aircraft
prints haven't been hung, and a few
other pieces of furniture haven't
arrived.

Green uses lamplight instead of
fluorescent light because, ‘‘(icmplight)
reduces the artificiality of the place.
Fluorescent lights make it look like a
professional office, a doctor’s office.’
