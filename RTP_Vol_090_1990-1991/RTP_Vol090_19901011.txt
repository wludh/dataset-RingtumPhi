The Fancy Dress schedule will not
Change despite objections by Law
students, whose spring break will
begin Fancy Dress weekend, Student
‘Activities Board Chairwoman Katie
Duwel announced last night during a
special meeting of the Executive
Committee.

““We felt that the benefits of
‘moving the date of the ball were
putweighed by the logistics and feasi-
bility of changing it,’’ Duwel said in
‘a prepared statement.

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

Duwel said a series of meetings
and a forum last Monday with Law
students was helpful to understand
their objection to a March 8 FD.
‘*However,”’ she said, ‘‘the SAB felt
that when considering the best
interests of the entire university, our
only fair alternative was to leave the
university’s calendar in place.’’

Duwel cited the iack of sufficient
manpower pledged by law students
this year to help set up for FD and
what the SAB considered an undue
burden that would be placed on un-
dergraduates during Washington
holiday if the date were changed to
March 1.

Security, grins and bears at as he gives blood at Tuesday’s
Red Cross blood drive, held in Doremus Gymnasium. The Chi
Psi fraternity sponsored the blood drive and helped the Red
Cross volunteers all afternoon attending to the donors. Staff

 

 

At the forum, which was held in
the Law School, Student Bar Associa-
tion President J. Grant Burns pres-
ented a petition signed by 57 Law
students who pledged to work 10
hours a week in preparation for the
ball.

Burns said the decision not to
change the date was made fairly, but
he disagreed with the wisdom of
making what he called the same
mistake two years in a row. FD last
year was held during the Law School
vacation and the SAB voted last
spring to keep the date the same this
year.

“‘The decision last year was one

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

of the most stupid decisions I’ve
come across in my lifetime,’’ Burns
said. ‘I don’t know what the EC was
thinking when they approved it.’’

Duwel acknowledged the error
made in scheduling the dance for the
same date this year and in failing to
consult the SBA before approving the
plan.

“The combination of the two
served to be pretty much a wrong
decision,’’ she said. ‘‘In hindsight we
could have consulted a few more
people maybe.”’

At the forum, several law students
accused the SAB Executive Board of
bias in the decision-making process

for this year.

‘Why is the burden of proof on
us to convince you to change the
date?’’ one law student asked Duwel.

“T have not made up my mind
either way,’’ Duwel said. ‘‘That’s
why we're here, to see what you
think about this and what can be
done.”’

Duwel announced last night the
SAB will offer the law school two
alternatives as compensation for the
mistake:

First, to offer the SBA the oppor-
tunity to purchase a block of FD
tickets — no fewer than S0 and no
more than 180 — and to sell them to

OCTOBER 11, 1990

FD date to stay the same, SAB says

law students at 20 percent less than
the regular price.

Second, Duwel said, the SAB will
provide law school students with an
“intimate cocktail party’’ before or
after the Ball.

The SBA also recommended that
the EC establish a special calendar
committee to ‘examine major con-
flicts with student body events and
holidays.”’

Burns agreed with the idea to
establish the new committee and to
consider the conciliatory measures.

EC president Tom Hatcher said
the EC will look into formalizing the
scheduling committee.

U.S. News ranks W&L 15th

 

By Cathy Lopiccolo
Assignment Editor

 

Washington and Lee is ranked
15th in a list of the top 25 liberal
arts colleges, according to the Oct. 15
issue of U.S. News and World Report.

W&L placed 18th in the same
survey last year. William Cocke in
the W&L News Office said the uni-
versity has also been named the "Best
Buy" among liberal-arts colleges for
the second year in a row in the mag-
azine’s 199] Best Colleges Book,
which will be released Monday.

The rankings are part of an annual
survey of 1,374 national four-year
schools which are separated into 14
categories based on location, size,
selectivity, types of degrees offered
and dollar amount of campus re-
search. The top two categories are
national universities and national
liberal-arts colleges.

Institutions within each category
are ranked through the use of statisti-
cal data~on selectvity, faculty and
financial resources, and graduation
rates. Schools’ academic reputations
are measured through questionaires
sent out to 4,131 university presi-
dents, deans and admissions directors.
A record 60.1 percent of the ques-
tionaires were filled out this year.

Amherst College placed first
among national liberal-arts colleges
with a perfect score of 100. W&L,
the only liberal-arts college in Vir-
ginia to appear on the list, received a
score of 86.2. Harvard University
topped the list of national universities
for the first time, while the Univer-
sity of Virgina placed 18th with a
score of 89.3.

According to W & L President
John D, Wilson, the U.S. News rank-
ings are more valid now than they
have been in the past.

“Tt started out very subjectively.

Now they look at application and
acceptance data and retention rates
and financial resources. I think you
can give more creedence to the rank-
ings now than a few years ago,”’
Wilson said.

Wilson said he was ‘‘gratified to
note that enough people esteem us
around the nation’’ for the university
to achieve its ranking.

Julia M. Kozack, associate direc-

awareness

tor of admissions said the publicity
from surveys like the one published
by U.S. News benefits a university,
but the effect on the number of ap-
plications for admission is impossible
to determine.

“There’s no basis to say that if
you get in one of those surveys,
applications for admission will in-
crease. But logic tells you that once
you're in a survey, more people hear

about you and interest peaks,’’ Ko-
zack said. ‘‘I think it reinforces what
people have already heard about a
school.”’

While Wilson agrees that the U.S.
News ranking will increase W&L’s
visibility, he does not want too much
emphasis placed on survey results.

“‘T think if we had a grain of salt
around somewhere we should take
that too,’’ Wilson said.

 

Week to push alcohol

‘By Nikki Magaziner
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee will join universities nationwide
(Oct. 15 to 21 in its fourth year of observing National
Collegiate Alcohol Awareness Week.

‘ The week, the theme of which is ‘‘Absolut
Awareness,’’ was originated to inform college students of
‘drinking habits and their effects,

+ Four major events are planned for the week. The first,
at 7 p.m. Monday, Oct. 15 in Lee Chapel, is a lecture
‘by Will Keim, who will discuss what he calls the
influence of Greek organizations on drinking attitudes.
‘The emphasis will be based on character development and
yesponsible management of social behavior.

At 7 p.m. Tuesday, a ‘Special Program for Women
Who Drink and for Men Who Drink With Women”? will

be presented in Northen Auditorium.

W&L professor Gwynn Campbell and Barbara
Sprinkle, the director of the Lexington Treatment Center
will lead a discussion physiological aspects of why
alcohol affects women differently than men.

Lost in the Supermarket will provide the background
music for a controlled drinking experiment Wednesday
night from 9 to 12 in the GHQ. The blood-alcohol levels
of student and faculty participants will be monitored by
Alco-sensor equipment supplied by Lexington police.

In the experiment, some students wil! be eating and
drinking; others only drinking, and the rate of inebriation
will be compared.

On Friday, a battle of student bands will be held at
The Student Activities Pavilion from 9 to 12 p.m. Soft
drinks and food will be provided free of charge.

These events, along with video displays, flyers and
other information to be distributed are sponsored by the

Dean of Students Office.

Most of the work is being done by students on the
Health Education Committee, under the student chair of
Alcohcl Awareness Weck, Mary Ansteine.

The Interfraternity Council, Contact, and Panhellenic
Council are also assisting in the week’s activities.

According to Associate Dean of Students Anne
Schroer-Lamont, ‘‘This week is to get us rolling for
academic year.”’

According to Schroer-Lamont, the impression the ad-
ministration seem to be receiving from the freshman class
is that more are trying to be careful when it comes to
alcohol.

The most important aspect of alcohol-awareness week
is the recognition of the care needed when dealing with
alcohol, she said.

“If they are going to drink, they should drink
responsibly.”’

 

Correction

The law school Outing Club
was incorrectly identified in last
week’s article on the Executive
Committee.

The law school Outing Club
}and the undergraduate Outing
Club are separate organizations
and the law school club does not
receive funding directly from the
EC.

The Phi regrets the confusion.

 

 

 

Budget passes EC’s first vote
Tentative budget exceeds $185,000

 

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

 

Complete list of allocations on page 4

The Executive Committee approved a
tentative list of budget allocations last night,
granting $185,250 to student organizations.

The Student Activities Board received a
tentative allocation of $48,450. The EC
directed a single cut at the Lenfest Center
opening for students, in which the adminis-
tration requested the SAB take part.

EC law reps. Mark Cobb, Giles Perkins
and Daniel Munroe, and EC Secretary Jef-
fery Kelsey opposed the SAB allotment,
desiring a cut directed at the SAB Fancy
Dress budget if the date would not be
changed to accommodate the Law School
calendar.

The Student Bar Association received
over $36,000 of its more than $40,000 re-
quest. The EC recommended cuts of $2,400
from honorariums and $2,000 from social
funds, the latter of which spurred debate.

Sophomore EC Rep. Kirk Ogden ob-
served that many undergraduates pay social
dues to fraternities in addition to the student
activities fee which contributes to SAB
social activities.

“The Law School is an extremely iso-
lated, unique situation in this littl town
with nothing to do,’’ said second-year law
Rep. Perkins two weeks ago. He concluded
that the Law School required social funding,
especially given that law students do not
have the fraternity opportunities of under-
graduate life.

The law representatives also noted that
law students pay dues of $51 each to the
SBA in addition to their student activities

fees.

The student body constitution mandates
that the EC pass the final budget a second
lime in at least one week by a two-thirds
majority.

Freshmen returned to the polls today to
elect class officers in run-offs. Ashby Hack-
ney and Ames Hutton competed for the EC
seat. Bill Chappell and Jeff Mikita ran for
president, while Blair Lee Hixson and Doug
Kaufman faced off for vice president. The
class president and vice president also repre-
sent the class on the Student Conduct Com-
mittee,

In other business, EC president Tom
Hatcher said posters would be posted an-
nouncing positions available on the student
Faculty, Athletic, Financial Aid, Admissions
and Health committees. Hatcher said a list
will be posted outside the EC office in the
University Center for interested students to

sign. Sophomores, juniors and seniors can
apply by writing a letter to the EC.

 

 

 

Prof. has
heart attack

 

From staff reports

 

Washington and Lee Professor of German B.S.
Stephenson is in intensive care at Stonewall Jackson
Hospital after suffering what is described as a ‘mild
heart attack’’ Tuesday.

According to a hospital spokesman, Stephenson was
listed in ‘‘Fair’’ condition Wednesday.

‘‘He seems to have had a mild heart attack,’’ said
Prof. Kirk Follo. ‘‘We aren’t sure yet how long he’s
going to be out of the classroom,”’

According to the Office of the Dean of the College,
Stephenson may be out ‘‘from four to six weeks,
although that’s only a preliminary guess,”’

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

OPINION

News value and
news judgement

In the last few weeks, there has been a great deal of
discussion in the Washington and Lee community about the
news judgement of The Ring-tum Phi staff, especially since
our Sept. 27 issue which lead with stories on fraternity Rush
violations. We have heard both derogatory and
complimentary remarks from readers. Expressing their
thoughts is their prerogative, and we carefully consider the
opinions we read and hear.

We would like, however, to clear up some of the
misconceptions surrounding the reasoning behind our actions.

First of all, we ran the story and editorial concerning the
allegations enveloping the top two members of the
Interfraternity Council because the charges had legitimate
news value. The men involved were not just any two
students being accused of breaking Rush rules, they were
the leaders of the IFC. It is noteworthy, to say the least, that
the two people empowered most to enforce the regulations
governing Rush were charged with blatantly ignoring those
tules.

Second, to ascribe the articles to prejudice on the part of
the fraternity members of the Phi seriously underestimates
our values as journalists as well as the contributions and
influence of two members of the paper’s Editorial Board,
who are women and independent. They have no reason to
sponsor any sort of vendetta against certain fraternity
members, nor would they condone any sort of vengeful
investigation.

Third, we purposefully left out the fraternity affiliations

of the IFC leaders because the story was, and is, not about _

particular fraternities. Our intention was not to cast
aspersions on any fraternity as a whole, but merely to
illuminate accusations of failures on the part of those
individuals who were assigned the responsibility to oversee
the Rush process.

This brings us to what we feel is the most unfortunate
part of this entire controversy. We can certainly understand
that people might question our motivations in running the
stories, but we are dismaved that more people are not
focusing on the implications that these accusations have
toward the whole of our community.

The IFC effectively represents the interests of 60 percent
of undergraduates. Fraternities have been at W&L for more
than a century, and enjoy a well-deserved place at the center
of our social life. As such, they also enjoy tremendous
influence over almost every W&L student. In fact, it may be
said that fraternities are surpassed only by the Honor Code
in their influence over the lives of brothers and pledges.

Maybe: itis. time to start admitting what really goes on
here at W&Y, admitting that although we proudly proclaim
that we are a bastion of honor and integrity, during Rush
many seem to think they need not abide by those precepts.

We hope the day never comes when our community has
to make that confession.

We ask instead that people begin to examine the attitudes
and the practices standing behind Rush; such that our
community is willing to accept, overlook and pardon the
transgressions with which the IFC officers have been
charged. Is this the fault only of those IFC officers who
stand accused? Of course not. The fault lies with everyone
who regards this as standard operating procedure.

Sbar on

THE SBAR SIDE
By Jon Sbar

 

 

On a recent Sunday in the dim
and contradictory past I spent an
entire afternoon skipping rocks across
a wide passage of the Maury River.
After depleting the river’s supply of
flat, skipping rocks, I tumed to round
rocks and began throwing them a
troop of young boy scouts searching
for important merit badges on the
other side of the river. When I ran
out of round missile rocks, | jumped
into a rapid flowing section of the
river and spent a few hours swim-
ming upstream. For a change of pace,
I stopped chuming my arms and
began floating down the river like a
log. After floating downstream for
three or four miles, I noticed that the
sky was dark. I exited the river and
rushed home in an effort to avoid the
monsters lurking in the night. At
home I sat down to watch an animal
television program featuring cheetahs
fighting over a zebra carcass.

seems almost insignificant. Secluded
on a college campus, many do not
know what is happening in the world.
What has Bush done now? Are we at
war with Iraq? Whom should I vote
for in my home state? When did
Germany unify? We vaguely realize
that these things are out there, but it
seems like a totally different world,
one that does not concern us.

The unification of Germany begins
a new era of history. A country di-

human sexual activities -

write about sex in the. tradition of
Freud who realized that all human
thoughts, energy and activities relate
to it. A girl who cuts up a banana,
for example, might appear to be
cutting up a banana, but in actuality
is expressing her secret desire to
castrate her father and marry her
mother. Even my seemingly innocent
first paragraph is based on sex. The
round rocks are breast symbols. My
floating like a log is a phallic sym-
bol. The river is a womb symbol.
The boy scouts looking for merit
badges is an orgasm symbol. The
monster lurking in the woods is a
pregnancy symbol. And the skipping
of the rock is a skipping of the rocks
symbol.

The human race is obsessed with
sex. They love thinking about it. they
love seeing it in the movies. They
love watching barnyard animals do it.
And most importantly, they love
reading about it. Do you think people
read romance novels to broaden their
minds?

HEATHCLIFF: ‘‘Oh Catherine,
my manhood is throbbing ardently for
you and especially your pendulous
double-D sized breasts.”’

CATHERINE: (Revealing her
pendulous double-D sized breasts) Oh
Heathcliff, I’ve waited so long to
hear those very words. Now, show
me your throbbing manhood.”’

Even works of literature dealing
with major philosophical questions
always throw in 4 little sex to keep
the reader from falling asleep.

service permits W&L students to borrow articles
from other libraries faster than when othr
libraries had to mail a Xerox copy of the
material.

W&L Head Librarian Barbara Brown said that
some students may even receive articles the same
day they request them as opposed to wailing
three to five days for a photocopy to arrive in
the mail. Other libraries nationwide will be able

to borrow materials in the same manner, she
said.

Writer to
give reading

Writer Marianne Gingher will give a reading
at W&L, Tuesday, Oct. 16, at 4:30 p,m, in
Northen Auditorium. The reading is open to the
public and is sponsored by the Glasgow
Endowment Program.

Gingher’s most recent work is a collection of
short stories entitled Teen Angel and Other
Stories of Young Love. The Atlanta Constitution
described the book as ‘‘a wonderful collection of
short stories with vivid, haunting characters...of
adolescents caught up in a painful, methodical
struggle of emotional growth.’’

The author of the novel Bobby Rex's Greatest
Hit and numerous short stories, Gingher is
currently a part-time lecturer at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A North Carolina
native, she received her B.A. in art and English
from Salem College and her M.F.A. from the
University of North Carolina.

MY VIEW
By Jonathan Karl

 

Free speech is under attack on college cam-
uses, and even its traditionally staunchest de-
fenders have joined in the assault.

* Student journalists and free speech advocates
are concerned about a proliferation of college
speech codes so widespread that, according to Time
{magazine, ‘‘Nowhere is the First Amendment more
imperiled than on college campuses.’’ As is often
the case with censorship, these codes have been
adopted with the best intentions: Campus racism is
on the rise and something has to be done about it.
So token measures are taken which exacerbate
facial tensions and ignore the First Amendment.

« Speech codes drafted in response to this impor-
tant issue are dividing the American Civil Liber-
ties Union, which has always tended toward an
«‘absolute’’ position on free speech. While the
Wisconsin and Michigan ACLU affiliates have
‘sued their respective state universities over the
godes, the northern and southern California af-
filiates adopted a resolution in July favoring
‘narrowly drawn policies which prohibit harassing
«speech.

John Powell, the national legal dirzctor of the
“ACLU, asserts: ‘‘My concern is less with the
strength of the First Amendment than with the
wave of radial harassment that has swept the coun-
‘try. The campus is not under the threat of being si-
Jenced.”’

Defending their resolution, the California affil-
jates cite the legal need to balance the First
Amendment against ‘‘conduct that interferes with
the Fourteenth Amendment right of students to an
equal education.’’ They argue that the resolution
only advocates a ban on speech in classroom
debates and public discourse is something students

must encitre or challenge with speech of their
own.”’

Free speech proponents such as writer Nat
Hentoff are not buying. Pointing out that cases
brought under the civil codes will be heard by
untrained college judicial panels, not civil liber-
tarians or ACLU attorneys, Mr. Hentoff decries the
inevitably vague nature of speech codes. ‘‘Most
colleges whose ‘due process’ hearing I’ve covered
are unshakably fond of the British Star Chamber
model of the 17th century,’’ he remarks sarcastical-
ly. ‘‘Just the places to deal with these broad and
vague restrictions on speech.”’

Rules which limit speech are only as good as
those who enforce them. Eleanor Holmes Norton,
President Carter’s chair of the federal Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission, explained this
bitter reality: ‘‘It is technically impossible to write
an anti-speech code that cannot be twisted against
speech nobody means to bar. It has been tried and
tried and tried.’’

Indeed, speech codes have been defended by
voices far less moderate than those of the ACLU’s
California affiliates. At Stanford University, law
professors provided the philosophical rationale for
a new student conduct policy that one student
sponsor candidly admitted ‘‘is not entirely in line
with the First Amendment.’’ ABA Journal, the

publication of the American Bar Association,

quotes Stanford Law Professor Mari Matsuda, who
argues that traditional views of free speech act as
a self-serving cover for continued domination buy
majority elites.

In Orwellian fashion, advocates of the code
argue that speech limitations would actually in-
crease free speech and ‘‘vigoroys debate.’’ Dis-
criminatory speech, they reason, is ineant to silence
the victim.

Such arguments are not only clearly cpposed to
First Amendment principles, they also threaten to
undercut the achievement of equal rights. Civil

‘Free speech on college campuses

rights activists have always relied on speech as
their principle weapon. In the long run, any com-
promise of principles of free speech works to the
detriment of minorities.

In addition to infringing on free speech, these
codes may actually fuel racism. As the recent
incident with the music group 2 Live Crew dramat-
ically demonstrates, attempts to censor offensive
views makes martyrs out of the censored. Did the
censoring of the album ‘‘As Nasty as They Wanna
Be’’ silence the misogynist lyrics of 2 Live Crew?
Definitely not. It showered the band in publicity,
thereby pro_elling them to the top of the charts.

Alan Keyes, a former assistant secretary of
state, points out.that the codes themselves arise out
of a racist and ‘condescending reasoning. In a
debate with the professor who wrote the code
adopted by Stanford University this spring, Mr.
Keyes argued against the ‘‘patronizing paternalistic
assumptions’’ upon which the code is founded. He

‘ expressed surprise that ‘‘someone would actually

think that I will sit in a chair and be told that
white folks have the moral character to shrug off
insults and I do not.”

Racism is a problem which must be addressed
with more than misguided measures like limiting
offensive speech. Not only are such measures open
to abuse, they also drive racism underground where
it thrives.

An academic environment characterized by an
unfettered pursuit of truth and knowledge should be
the ideal forum to expose and defeat the ignorance
that fuels racism.

The ACLU’s John Powell forcefully argues, _

“The primary problem is that we haven;t begun to
seriously discuss racial issues.’’ He is absolutely
right. But the speech-restricting policies he seems
to advocate will only have a chilling effect on the
needed discussion.

NAACP blasts student housing permits

 

By Gregory Patterson
Staff Reporter

 

The debate over housing in the
Lexington area flared up again at last
week’s city council meeting when a
local representative of the National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People said Washington and
Lee students are squeezing low-in-
come minority families out of the
market.

Rev. J.B. Harris of the local chap-
ter of the NAACP blasted the council
as it prepared to approve three appli-
cations for large-capacity houses.

Harris said that by giving condi-
tional-use permits to houses and
thereby allowing more than four
unrelated people to live in a house
together, the council was putting such
houses out of the reach of local resi-

dents.

He said that owners of such
houses cater to student tenants and
raise rents out of the price range of
residents who need someplace to live.

“This says to me that you are
suddenly endorsing housing discrimi-
nation,’’ Harris told the council. He
said a ‘‘potential housing investiga-
tion’’or a lawsuit against the city
would both be possibilities ‘‘if cur-
rent trends persist.”’

Harris offered a number of pro-
posals he said would ease the situa-
tion. He said W&L should rent ex-
cess dorm rooms to local residents
and develop any vacant university-
owned land for student apartments.

Harris also suggested that the city
place a moratorium on permits for
large-capacity housing and encourage
realtors to give local residents the

first chance at rental property.

Lexington mayor H.E.‘*Buddy”
Derrick said the city is not ignorant
of the situation.

‘We are not unmindful of what
gives rise to the comments being
made here,’’ he said. ‘‘We have not
considered any houses [for a cond-
tional use permit] that have not typi-
cally been in this market.’’

The requirement specifying that a
permit must be obtained for houses
with more than four unrelated persons
living together went into effect this
June. A conditional use permit is
good for five years, after which the
owner must go through the complete
application process again.

A permit can be revoked if occu-
pants of the house are convicted of
violations of the city’s noise, health,
or sanitation ordinances.

 

City to hire tax assessor
for W&L students’ cars

determine how feasible it is [to try and collect the car
tax] and the only way to know is to find out.’’

 

By Gregory Patterson
Staff Reporter

 

City officials, however, said they were not sure

Lexington will hire someone to begin collecting tax
on student cars, but city officials say they do not know
yet whether the new employee will hit the streets to
try and track down Washington and Lee students’ cars.

At a meeting last Thursday night, city council
appropriated $5000 to hire a person to identify and
assist with the collection of the tax. The new employee
will work part-time for six months.

The council had originally planned to use $25,000
for a one year full-time position, but those plans were
eclipsed by recent statewide budget cuts.

whether or not the new employee will roam the city
Streets trying to identify cars belonging to W&L
students, as rumors have suggested.

According to interim city manager David Woody,
“It will be a temporary position in the commissioner
of revenue’s office...It will depend on how the
commissioner wants to handle it.’’

When asked in September whether or not the city
had hired someone to hunt down the cars, Woody said
the idea had ‘‘not been pursued,’’ but that it would be
“‘one way to try and catch some’”’ student cars, since
the university has refused to turn over the list of

Students help to fight cancer

 

By Kim Boots
Staff Reporter

On Sunday, 120 people partici-
pated in the ‘Making Strides for
Cancer’ move-along-athon and raised
$750 for cancer treatment and re-
search in Rockbridge County.

Electra Martin, student coordinator
of the event, said the goal of $1000
was not reached but that she was
pleased with the number of people
whe got involved. The number of

participants this year doubled that of
last year, which was the first year the
event took place in Lexington.

Walkers, runners and bikers trav-
eled the five-mile course through
Lexington, beginning and ending at
Harris Teeter. The course circled the
Virginia Military Institute and Wash-
ington and Lee campuses.

Lexington resident Hannah Her-
ward raised the most money, $207,
and was awarded with a two-night
trip to the Massanutten Resort near
Harrisonburg. Other large contribu-

tors received prizes donated by loca'
businesses and door prizes were given
to random participants. W&L students
comprised the majority of partic-
ipants.

Preparations are underway for next
year’s ‘‘Making Strides for Cancer.”’
Elizabeth Dettmar, one of the orga-
nizers of the event, said, ‘‘It was a
lot of fun and we’re looking for vote
more people next year.’

The walk was associated with the
American Cancer Society, but all of
the funds will be put to use locally.

Stutzmann
hat trick
leads W&L

By MacGregor Tisdale
Staff Reporter

 

 

Freshmen are breathing new life
into the Washington and Lee
women’s soccer team.

Early in the season, when the
offense struggled, it was freshman
goalie Kate Stimeling who kept the
Generals above water until the of-
fense could come through.

Now, the offense is shining, and
it is a freshman who is doing the
dirty work. Karen Stutzmann scored
three times to lead the Generals to a
3-2 victory over Wheeling Jesuit Col-
lege at Liberty Hall Field on Satur-
day.

Stutzmann scored all three of the
Generals goals marking the first hat
trick ever in W&L women’s soccer
history.

‘Karen is becoming a leader in
her own right,’’ said head coach Jan-
ine Hathorn. ‘‘As a freshman, she is
very poised in game situations and
knows what to do with the ball.”’

What she is doing is putting the
ball in the back of the opponents’
nets. She has four goals in the last
two games and seven on the young
season.

Stutzmann, from Port Washington,
N.Y., is quick to point out that she is
not doing it all by herself. ‘‘The
whole team contributed to the three
goals. We played well as a team,”’
she said.

Stutzmann gave W&L a 1-0 lead
off a feed from junior Ashley Gray.
Wheeling tied it at 1-J at the half.
Wheeling scored first in the second
half to take a brief 2-1 lead before
Stutzmann turned up the offensive
heat. She scored two goals in a six

ODAC success for soccer

 

By John Laney
Associate Sports Editor

 

A wet playing surface, a dismal
record against -ynchburg and even a
seven-year-old Lexington boy inter-
rupting play by coming onto the field
to pick up the ball, did not deter the

Washington and Lee men’s soccer'

team from defeating the Hornets, 2-
0, yesterday at Liberty Hall Field.

After a demanding nonconference
schedule, which produced no wins in
five games, the Generals are finding
comfort and success in the Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference.

Yesterday’s win was W&L’s third
in a row, as the Generals improved
their record to 5-4-2 (3-0-1 in the
ODAC). Extending back to last sea-
son, W&L is unbeaten in its last nine
conference games.

In its other ODAC game this

week, W&L beat Eastern Mennonite,
2-0, on Saturday in Harrisonburg, Va.

W&L had not beaten Lynchburg
since 1986 and had beaten them only
once in head coach Rolf Piranian’s
15-year career.

Yesterday, however, the Generals
dominated offensively, as they di-
rected 18 shots at the Hornets’ net,
ricocheting one off each post and
another off of the crossbar.

The two that settled into the net
were scored by junior midfielder
David DeFalco and freshman forward
Tim McCarthy.

With 14:32 remaining in the first
half, DeFalco scored from close range
on a pass from sophomore forward
Reid Murphy. With just over 15
minutes gone in the second half,
Hornet goaltender Vernon Croft mis-
handled sophomore midfielder Mike
Mitchem’s corner kick and the ball
rolled into the net.

‘I'm pleased with the way we
played,’’ Piranian said. ‘‘But there

were moments when we let up and ,

I'm convinced that could kill us. We
have got to keep our intensity up.’’
Against Eastern Mennonite on

AstroTurf, two free kicks set up both '

of W&L’s goals. The Generals scored
within the first four minutes when
Murphy, who was running across the

goal mouth, flicked the ball into the :

net with his head. Ten minutes later,
a corner kick dropped in front of
sophomore sweeper Greg Williams,
who sent the ball from 12 yards
away into the left side of the goal.

‘We're a lot better soccer team
than we were. But we haven't had a
90-minute effort yet and that’s what
it will take to keep winning,’
Piranian said.

On Saturday at 1:30 p.m, W&L
will host Virginia Wesleyan (10-0-2),
the ODAC’s top team.

Both the Washington and Lee
men’s and women’s cross country
teams gave strong showings in their
respective meets at Lynchburg Col-
lege this past weekend.

The women remained unbeaten in
the Old Dominion Athletic Conferen-
ce as they downed Lynchburg and
Mary Baldwin 25-40-73, upping their
overall record to 7-1.

Seniors Shawn Wert and Cecily
Tynan finished third and fourth res-
pectively to lead a pack of five W&L
runners that finished within two min-
utes of each other.

“Our top five has become ex-
tremely consistent,’’ said head coach
Jim Phemister. ‘‘We’re looking for-
ward to the state meet to see how we
stack up against the competition at
the midpoint in the season.”’

The men’s team posted two vic-
tories and a loss in a four-team meet
that was scored as four dual’ meets.
W&L scored wins over Hampden-
Sydney 15-49 and Catholic 25-30,
while losing a tough race to Lynch-
burg 21-37.

Said head coach John Tucker,
‘‘We ran our best race all year
against Lynchburg.’’

Tucker pointed out that the steep-
ness of Lynchburg’s course added to
an already tough race, and he was

   

pleased that runners were still able to *

cut considerable amounts of time off
of races on comparable courses.

Leading the W&L charge was .
sophomore Bo Hannah, who was fifth

overall followed by juniors Charles
Edwards and David Martin and:soph-
omore Keith Wren. Edwards was
hampered by an injury. Earlier, while

scouting the course, he fell and badly _

bruised his knee.

This saturday both teams will
compete in the Virginia State Div-
ision II] championships which. The
meet will serve as a tune-up for the
ODAC championships coming up
three weeks from now.

Woes continue for W&L football

The 1990 Washington and Lee
football season has been one that has
raised some serious questions.

The main question concerns the

Sampson and Chris Smythe graduated

‘from the 1989 team, leaving a void at
the position this season.

into camp as the incumbent, won the

Despite winning two of three Old

women’s volleyball team is still look-

W&L defeated Roanoke Tuesday
‘night in a thrilling five-game

and raced 56 yards to the W&L 12.
Two plays later, the Scots took a 7-
0 lead when Kelly Moore scored
from seven yards out.

W&L tied the game at the end of
the first quarter, using a big play
from the defense to spark the drive.

On a third and 16, Moore was
intercepted by sophomore Donald
Dempsey. Dempsey returned the

On the ensuing kickoff, Renneker
fumbled the ball as he was brought
down and the Scots recovered at the
W&L 25-yard line. Two plays later,
Moore hit split end David King with

Scots a 21-7 lead at halftime.

interception 21 yards to the Maryville
41 behind a block from junior Scott
Williamson.

The Generals then went to the
running game. Senior workhorse
Mason Pope capped a nine-play, 41-
yard drive with a four-yard touch-
down run to tie the game at 7-7 after
one quarter.

But the drive would be W&L’s
only sustained drive of the day. On
the rest of the afternoon, W&L would
get only two first downs for a total
of seven on the day.

Maryville took control in the
second quarter behind special teams
play. Stephens returned a punt 19
yards to the W&L 19, setting up
Keith Washington’s 12-yard touch-
down run to give the Scots a 14-7
lead.

On Renneker’s first possession, he
showed signs that he could move the
team poor field position. Renneker
scampered for 16 yards, but a penalty
brought that back, and Renneker’s
first pass was broken up and thc
Generals had to punt.

The second half was played to a
scoreless tie, due greatly to the play
of Maryville punter Scott Porter and
the W&L defense. The W&L defense
allowed the Scots only 85 yards of
offense in the second half.

Porter kept the W&L pinned deep
in its own territory. In the second
half, the W&L offense started drives
from its own 10-yard line, 12-yard
line, one-yard line, five-yard line, 15-
yard line and 20-yard line.

On the afternoon, W&L was held
to 175 yards of total offense, with 52

Said Fallon, ‘‘I didn’t think we
were particularly sharp in any area. |

need to play with more emotion and
enthusiasm.”’

an earlier conference loss to Emory

“We don’t have a weak player

coach Susan Dittman.

In a conference match against
Salem last week, Dittman rotated
twelve players into the lineup as the
Generals rolled on to a 15-6, 15-4

Against Emory and Henry the
Generals nearly rallied to a win in
ihe second game before the Yellow
Jackets stung quickly with late points
to clinch a victory. After falling in
game two, W&L could not muster a
comeback.

‘It was one of those games,”’
said Dittman. ‘‘After we lost the
pivotal second game, mentally, we
weren’t ready to win three in a
row.”

One highlight, however, was the

play of junior co-captain Mena
McGowin who recorded 15 kills, 9
digs, and no errors.

"Mena’s playing was outstanding,”
said Dittman. "She had that look.
When Mena gets THE LOOK, Mena
wins the game."

Next week the Generals face
Eastern Mennonite and Bridgewater.

"We've never taken a game from
either Eastern Mennonite or Bridge-

New ways to break your diet

 

By Joshua Manning
Staff Reporter

 

Those interested in Lexington
dining have reason to rejoice. Two
new options, a Shoney’s and an Ital-
ian Restaurant, are set to join Lex
cuisine in the near future.

According to Robert DeMaria,
President of the Lexington/Rockbridge
Chamber of Commerce, Shoney’s
corporate office has recently finalized
a deal to buy a plot of land on Route
11 next to the Golden Corral, north
of Lexington. The company plans to
begin construction soon for a sched-
uled grand opening in the spring.

DeMaria mentioned that this is
not the first time Shoney’s has at-
tempted to locate itself in the Rock-
bridge area. Six or seven years ago,

the Board of Supervisors shot down
a plan to build a restaurant on the
then undeveloped area east of Lexi-

ngton. ‘‘Now the city needs more
restaurants, a better variety,’’ said
deMaria. The Board has already

approved the new development.

Unlike other Shoney’s, this new
restaurant will not be a_ local
franchise. It will be owned and
operated by Shoney’s Corp., employ-
ing 70 to 90 people. DeMaria
believes that the restaurant will bring
more people into the area north of
Lexington. Rather than hurting the
Golden Corral, Shoney’s should, in
deMaria’s view, be able to hold its
own and help its neighbor.

Il Palazzo, the Italian Restaurant,
will be located in the building next
door to the Willson Walker House on
Main Street. Ugo Benincasa, Lexi-

The Ring-tum Phi, October 11, 1990

ngton resident and father of W&L
junior Armando Benincasa, owns the
building and plans to open his new
venture in early December.

With 25 years experience, Benin-
casa is not a stranger to the rest-
aurant business. His brother, Frank,
is the owner of Frank’s Pizza. Ugo
had been a partner in that business at
its inception, but now he wishes to
try to tempt Lexington palates in his
own way.

‘‘We’re looking forward to open-
ing up in Lexington, there is a
definite market,’’ said Benincasa.
‘There are no other restaurants like
it here.”’

The restaurant will serve dishes
from both northern and southern
Italy. He hopes that this will give
place a unique flavor. Besides the
main dishes, the menu will include

sandwiches, pizza, calzone,
Italian seafood, wines, and other
beverages. SBenincasa and his wife,
Gena, will do the cooking for the
restaurant. Prices will be kept moder-
ate, ranging from around $3-4 for a
sandwich to $9-13 for a complete
dinners.

salads,

DeMaria believes that much of the
recent growth in Lexington cuisine is
due to crowd drawing ventures such
as the Horse Center. ‘‘Shoney’s, in

particular, is a manifestation of the
Horse Center’s  impact,’’ said
DeMaria. ‘‘I’m not sure that it is the

same with /! Palazzo. However,
knowing the Benincasa family and
their history of good food at good
prices, I’m confident that their res-
taurant will be a wonderful addition
to the Lexington Business district.’’

Traditionalists play Mozart

The Mozartean Players, a classical
music ensemble, performed Tuesday
night in Lee Chapel for an almost
full house.

The performance, presented by the
Washington and Lee Concert Guild,
began at 8 p.m. and lasted until just
before 10 p.m. It was the first perfor-
mance of the Mozartean Players ever
at Washington and Lee.

The group played the Trio in B-
flat by Mozart; Trio in C by Haydn;
and Beethoven’s Trio in E-flat.

The group was siarted in 1970
and has made an international reputa-

tion for itself since that time. They
have made concert tours through
Europe and America, including per-
formances at major festivals, chamber
music series and university, college,
and museum performances. The group
is based in New York and plays
regularly at Camegie Hall, Lincoln
Center and the Metropolitan Museum
of Art.

The individual performers who
make up the group are all highly
acclaimed as solo musicians. Pianist
Steven Lubin has been acclaimed in
the United States and Europe.

The violinist, Stephanie Chase, is
one of her generation’s most
acclaimed violinists. She won a
bronze medal at the 1982 Tchaikov-

Student Charge

 

The original instruments have a
slightly different sound than their
modern counterparts, largely due to
the use of gut strings for the violin
and cello. The piano played by Lubin
was a copy of one built in 1790. It
has fewer keys than the modem piano
and is made entirely out of wood.
The sound that it makes is gentle,
and has been called expressive.

The violin that Chase played was
made in the middle of the 18th cen-
tury and Lutzke’s cello was built
around 1800. The sound of these
instruments is more mellow than the
modern violin and cello so they
balance better with one another, al-
lowing the inner workings of the
music to be appreciated.
