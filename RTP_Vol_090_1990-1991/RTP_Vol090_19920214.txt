Pro-troop rally

raised

 

By Chris Simon
Staff Reporter

 

The Board of Trustees voted last
weekend to increase Washington and
Lee undergraduate and Law School
tuitions by more than six percent next
year.

In a move that will push the
annual average cost of tuition, room
and board to $15,650 per student, the
Trustees set undergraduate tuition at
$11,575 and Law School tuition at
$12,050 for 1991-92.

For the last two years, W&L has
been listed as a ‘‘best buy’’ among
private colleges and universities by
the magazine U.S. News and World
Report in its annual ratings colleges.

The Board also outlined the pre-
liminary steps for an endowment
campaign set to begin in 1992. The
campaign would boost W&L’s current
$150 million endowment fund by

 

approximately $100 million.

Board regretted that the incident took
place.”’

Despite Wilson’s concems that the
incident had threatened the $12 mil-
lion Fraternity Renaissance program,
the Trustees reaffirmed their commit-
ment to completing the project.

Throughout the weekend, Trustees
received favorable reports from var-
ious university departments. Hotchkiss
said the Board was particularly im-
pressed with the Admissions Depart-
ment’s report. Application rates in-
creased this year at W&L despite a
shrinking national application pool.

“The Board came away feeling
very encouraged about Washington
and Lee University,’’ said Hotchkiss.

urday In the Warner Center. The

“Of all the things in the cam-

item in the endowment,”’ said Sec-
retary to the University Farris Hotch-
kiss. ‘‘We hope that we will have
raised our ability to help students
through our endowment™gifts™in a
major way.”’

The Trustees also heard prelimi-
nary reports on the proposed Student
Center. Hotchkiss maintained that
design, location and _ construction
logistics for the Center are still in-
complete.

In other business, the Board ex-
pressed support for President John
Wilson’s suspension of three W&L
students involved with vandalism at
the recently renovated Sigma Alpha
Epsilon.

“The Board was very solidly
behind the position that President
Wilson took on that issue,’’ said

‘ The Student Conduct Committee, in
conjunction with the administration, is re-
examining the university's judiciary process and
* will present reccomendations for procedural
changes to the Student Affairs Committee after
Washington Break.

‘ EC President Tom Hatcher said that the
Campus Life Committee of the Board of
Trustees, which met in Lexington last weekend,
* charged him with pursuing possibilities for
changes.

‘*My personal concem is that it [the system]
¢ is so cumbersome that it hampers the
effectiveness of the committee,’’ said Hatcher.
“Our goal is to make it as efficient as
« possible.’’

According to Dean of Students David

Howison, the proposed revisions will address
the following issues: the way in which
members are chosen to be on the SCC, the way
in which members of the community are
informed about the judiciary process, the
investigative process, the role of the advocate
(the person who represents the accused), and
the way in which the SCC complements the
honor system.

‘*We want a system based on honor. Second,
a clear system that all students can use; a
system that works fast so cases go in and out
as quickly as possible,’’ said SCC Chairman
Spurgeon.

Spurgeon said he is compiling a 30-page
proposal to address basic constitutional changes
of the SCC. The proposed changes come after
President Wilson’s recent decision to suspend
three students without the consultation of
student government.

Howison said that one of the options would

 

 

‘Prof. Parker

have been to involve the SCC, but that because
of the context of the incident, the president
needed to take decisive action.

Howison would not say that the SCC was
incapable of decisive action, but merely said,
“‘they’re honorable people and do the best they
can.”’

Howison proposed that student hostility
resulting from the president’s actions might be
geared in a more positive direction.

‘‘The key is how to channel the honest
differences of opinion and strong emotional
feelings, ’’ said Howison.

When asked to give students forewarning of
what would result in such strong action in the
future, Howison said that he may ask the
students to decide.

One possibility, Howison said, is getting the
students to define a few areas of conduct that
they consider unacceptable or dishonorable.

Howison admitted that there would be

Hotchkiss. ‘‘At the same time, the

problems in forming clear definitions for
“‘dishcnorable conduct.’’ He did say, however,
that unprovoked physical assault would be one
such instance.

Though it will not institute internal revisions
itself, the Executive Committee, according to
Hatcher will ‘‘move forward with the IFC to
promote contingency plans for the fraternities,
something along the. lines of automatically
tuming over instances of vandalism to the
cc

‘In this way, we would ensure that the
SCC, our elected representatives, will adjudicate
student conduct violations,’’ said Hatcher.

There will be ongoing discussion concerning
the procedural revisions, he said.

Howison said he is encouraged by the
progress, and that hopes to have formal
recommendations for changes ready for the
faculty by April and to the Board of Trustees
by May.

The Board of Trustees sup-
ports President John Wilson’s
controversial suspension of three
students, according to Rector A.
Stevens Miles, Jr.

“The Board agreed with the
action that he took,’’ Miles said
on Monday, ‘‘but we did that
with regret.”’

According to Miles, the regret
was in response to an apparent
failure in student government.

“We're absolutely committed
to the student run Honor Code

Despite continuing controversy between students
and city officials, the city of Lexington is prepar-
ing to send personal property tax bills to vehicle
owners within a few days.

At last Thursday’s City Council meeting, Mayor
H.E. Derrick said the city has held off long enough
and would begin sending bills to car owners who
are not currently paying the tax.

Derrick said the city was ready to send the bills
before a meeting between city officials and student
representatives on Jan. 22. After no compromise
was reached at a second meeting on Feb. 5, Der-
rick said he decided to go ahead and prepare the
bills.

Commissioner of Revenue Courtney Baker said
she has tumed over all billing information to the
city treasurer's office and the bills are being
prepared.

Baker said 350 to 400 bills are being prepared,
but not all of the bills are for W&L students. She
said the list also includes VMI cadets and local

“I hardly think it’s a surprise. It’s something
we've been working on for two years,’’ said
Baker.

Baker said she is sorry for the timing, with the
bills being sent out just before Washington Holi-
day. The bills will be sent to the registered owners
of the vehicles. Bills sent to parents should arrive
while students are home on break, she said.

Baker said she wants to eliminate the miscon-
ception that students, especially Virginia residents,
will be taxed twice.

‘There is no reason to pay tax on property in
the place where property isn’t,’’ said Baker.
“‘People are not going to be made to pay twice."’

Derrick said he hopes students will cooperate.

“It is a proper and correct tax,’’ said Derrick.
“‘Given the standards of the student body and the
Honor System, I would hope that there will be no
problems.

Executive Committee president Tom Hatcher
called the city’s decision ‘‘unfortunate and short
sighted,’’

Hatcher said the city’s plan to collect the tax
from students is ‘‘a blatant attempt to increase
revenue at the expense of non-constituents.’’

‘The city’s financial problems are a result of
a short-sighted decision by the City Council and
W&L students today are paying for it,’’ said
Hatcher.

Hatcher refers to a decision by the City Council
in the mid-1980s to enter into a revenue-sharing
agreement with Rockbridge County.

As part of the agreement, the city consented not
to annex any more land and thus cannot expand
the base of taxable land.

Hatcher says he is not willing to reconsider a
boycott since he believes that it would ‘‘hurt
people who really don’t have much say.”’

However, Hatcher said he is still planning to
make a presentation at the March 7 City Council
meeting.

“I’m still planning tg. go to City Council and
give them a piece of mY mind,”’ said Hatcher.
Hatcher said he thinks the city is going to have
trouble collecting the tax from students.
“All [ can say to the city is ‘Good luck,’’’ said

Hatcher
 

OPINION

ee
As American

as apple pie

Last Saturday afternoon, Washington and Lee was the site
for one of many ‘‘support the troops’’ rallies. The Warner
Center, which ironically had been the location of Hunter
Thompson’s somewhat disjointed anti-war ramblings only
five days before, was filled with 600 vocal supporters of our
war with Iraq, or at least supporters of those now fighting
that war.

That’s the good news. The bad news is that something
not quite so positive could be gleaned from that gathering.
There seems to be an increasingly popular notion that the
only way to be patriotic is to support the war effort; that
somehow only those who agree with the decision to oust
Saddam Hussein from Kuwait (or simply to oust him) are
entitled to brandish the American Flag.

A recurring theme in some of the many impassioned
speeches at the rally was that student-led protests of the
Vietnam War are responsible for our ignominious defeat
there. That had the government and the troops been given
more support back home, we could have won.

That, to us, begs the question. Surely, it is not the stated
policy of the United States of America, the bright light of
freedom and democracy in a sometimes dark world, to enter
wars only because we think we can win. Is it not possible
that the protesters of the Vietnam era fought against the war
effort because they believed that we should not have been
there, that our cause was not just? Perhaps that is the reason
that anti-war protests are not as common now, because a
majority believe that our current cause is just.

Whether or not that is the case, to accuse those against
the war of being ‘‘anti-American’’ is to engage in senseless,
worthless demagoguery. Like it or not, to speak against a
tide of majority opinion requires a certain kind of courage,
a courage that deserves better than to be blandly written off
as ‘‘unpatriotic.”’

After all, the intolerance of minority opinion was what
drove our Founding Fathers to the New World in the first
place. Since there are no convenient alternative continents to
which those with unpopular ideas may be exiled, we suggest
that everyone learn to better deal with non-conformity of
opinion.

Congratulations

There were several winners in the recently completed Big
Three elections. Of course, The Ring-tum Phi congratulates
President-elect Giles Perkins and Secretary-elect Caroline
Wight. At press time, we don’t yet know the winner of the
runoff for Vice President.

The other winner, one that equally _ deserves
congratulations, is the student body; a large majority of
which turned out to vote. More than 1,100 undergrads and
law students showed up, which makes for an impressive
percentage.

Help wanted

It’s that time of year again. Applications are now being
accepted for the Editors of the 1991-2 Ring-tum Phi. Please
submit a cover letter and resume to Carol Calkins’ office
before March 13. Interviews will be held March 17-18.

IN OUR FRATERNITY

 

MY VIEW

By Laura Taylor

 

Some of you older students and
faculty members may remember that
nearly two years ago I wrote an
opinion column for this paper poking
fun at the first issue of the Spectator.
I intended no harm, because I have
great respect for the intelligence of
most of its staff members, but I
wanted to point out a major flaw,
which was the Spectator's policy of

taking potshots at anyone or anything
that did not suit the writer’s concept
of what was right (i.e., white, Anglo-
Saxon, Christian and Republican).

I had hoped that, after a year’s
absence from W&L, I would return
to find the Spectator full of lively,
intelligent commentary — even if I do
not agree with its ideology. Imagine
my disappointment when I realized
that the Spectator was producing the
same old nonsense as before. I tried
to ignore it, in hopes that it was all
just a figment of my active imagina-
tion, but I was sharply brought back

  
    
   

,

 

to reality by Mr. Humphries’ most
recent article, ‘‘Myth of Multi-
culturalism.’’ I will not waste my (or
anyone else’s) time by tearing the
article to shreds, but I have taken it
upon myself to enlighten Mr.
Humphries about some of the darker
aspects of his beloved Christian West.

FACT: Augustine of Hippo was a
hypocrite. Although he may have
been a great theologian, and one of
the first to extol the virtues of fore-
going the pleasures of the flesh, he
had fathered a son by his concubine.

FACT: Many of the men (and

women) we praise as saints or found-
ers of the Church were condemned as
heretics by that very same Church.
They were, among others, Tertullian,
John Chrysostom, Thomas Aquinas,
and Joan of Arc.

FACT: Three of this millennium’s
greatest thinkers were distinctly not
Christian. Maimonides was Jewish,
and Avicenna and Averroes were
both Muslim. Avicenna’s influence
was so great that his medical texts

Fraternities use
Code to conceal

In light of the recent hoopla surrounding yet
another incident of fraternity misconduct, com-
plete with accusations. directed at both the admin-

, istration, and. the houses themselves, it. seems

necessary to point out a few oversights. Although
I do not wish to attack the Spectator, it is safe
to say that the recent supplement has made a
couple of these oversights very obvious.

First of all, I would like to point out the
irony in the article’s reference to ‘‘uncivilized
verbiage’” on the part of President Wilson.
Anyone present at the open forum can attest to
the fact that the students whose random shouting
and rude behavior that marked the meeting are
the most guilty of ‘‘uncivilized’’ behavior.

Furthermore, the Spectator seems to imply
that President Wilson is unable to differentiate
between ‘‘the pledged word and fraternal rela-
tionships.’’ The relationship between the fraterni-
ties and the Honor Code shows that the fraterni-
ties are the ones incapable of drawing the line.
The method used by fraternity officials to discov-
er the guilty parties in this and other cases seems
structured to allow fraternities to hide behind the
Honor Code. If Mike Skarda knew that the
Honor Code would not permit him to reveal the
names of the responsible students, what was he
planning to do with the knowledge once they
came forward to confess? According to the
Honor Code, he could not even inform the
SCC — the Spectator's desired course of action.

Although everyone may not be guilty of this
cowardice, il is easy to see how fraternities can
justify concealing information by claiming that
the Honor Code silences them. Many students,
fraternity members included, are offended by
seeing fraternities protect themselves with the
Honor System while breaking various laws and
even breaching the Code itself. A short list of
these violations would include: the continued
hazing by many fraternities, the theft of road
signs for decorative uses, the continued use of
fake ID’s to purchase alcohol, and (yet another
irony) the theft of Christmas trees.

Of course in most cases, the proof required to
justify these accusations is attainable only by
members of the guilty fraternity and surfaces to
outsiders through the word of a member who has
seen it happen. If I am wrong in assuming that
an outsider who hears such second-hand knowl-
edge cannot legally accuse someone of a crime
they did not witness, please correct me.

Many of us, independents and fraternity
members included, are sickened by the blatant
violations committed in the name of ‘‘Fraternity
Pranks,’’ which slip through the system. The
time has long since passed to consider whether
or not the “‘traditional’’ behavior of fraternities
can coexist with the tradition of honor. Subse-
quently, we must decide which is more worthy of
our energy.

Sincerely,
David Wilmington '94

Wilson failed
student trust

President Wilson and his faculty supporters
have failed the student trust. They have by-
passed the procedure in which we put our faith
in order to make students aware of their new
restricted rights. Student rights are now secondary
to the policy prerogatives of the administration.
The incident is no longer an issue of whether
students should be punished for breaking win-
dows, but rather the autonomy of student govern-
ment and the procedure in which we put our
faith. President Wilson has sacrificed the means

LETTERS

to justify the ends. This act goes against the
principles in which both Washington and Lee
believed. Judgement by our peers is a right
which the administration cannot usurp. If our
system fails to deal properly with problems, it
fails us more than anyone. However, it is our

responsibility to reform ‘the system, not the
responsibility of an administration that’ feels» it :
‘~~ knows" best: aa v

President Wilson is not the first executive
who has bypassed procedure to achieve his goals.
Watergate and the Iran-Contra scandals were
about executives bypassing procedure for expedi-
ency. President Wilson shares as much popularity
among the student body as Richard Nixon after
Watergate. President Wilson has substituted his
vision of progress for that of the procedure of
student government we embrace. Our system has
worked for 116 years since the days when
General Lee led Washington College. I hope that
President Wilson’s vision of progress will not
erase this tradition.

Unless President Wilson repeals his decision
and puts the case before the SCC for review, he
will not have the respect or trust of the W&L
community. His action has shown he does not
respect or trust us. No leader can lead a commu-
nity without the respect of those he leads. |
suggest that President Wilson show honor and
leadership by repealing his decision and putting
the matter of action before the SCC, If he fails
to do this, he will not be the legitimate leader of
the W&L community. Maybe President Wilson
should resign if he doesn’t have faith in those he
leads. The grocery packing spots around Lexing-
ton have been filled by suspended students, but
I hear there is a busboy position open at Lee-
Hi truckstop.

Sincerely,
Ted Elliot 94

Students apologize

We apologize for the breach of student ethics
which occurred on Jan. 31, 1991. The SCC has
made it clear that these actions are unacceptable,
and we agree with that decision wholeheartedly.
Our actions were inexcusable and again we
apologize.

Patriotic display
makes vet proud

An event took place on Sunday evening,
January 27 which I would be remiss if I did not
share with the W&L community.

We here at Letitia Pate Evans Dining Hall
were having our annual Super Bowl Sunday party
(buffet, giant screen TV, contest, etc.). At ap-
proximately 6:20 P.M., there were 350 students,
guests and staff present in the Dining Hall.
Everyone was having a good time talking, enjoy-
ing the buffet and interacting with folks as they
anticipated the kickoff of Super Bowl XXV.

At this time, I sensed a sudden quietness in
the front of the room near the TV. I positioned
myself so that I could see the TV, and noticed
Whitney Houston had begun to sing our National
Anthem.

I then observed individuals — then groups -
- then whole tables of people stand up in silence.
Within ten seconds, everyone in the Dining Hall
was standing reverently, and in total and absolute
silence. Each person listened with a different
stance — some with heads bowed, some with
hands over hearts. A VMI cadet, who had joined
us for dinner, stood at attention, proudly saluting.

Being a veteran, I know pride of country, but

I have never been more proud or more moved as
I was while observing our students — the youth
of America.

Sincerely,

John T. Taffe

Objectivity a

key to war effort

I just experienced the patriotism of the Wash-
ington and Lee community. Today’s ‘‘Support the
Troops”’ rally was undoubtedly pro-American and
will hopefully boost the coalition’s morale.
Furthermore, the rally provided an exceptional
experience for the students who attended it: it
underscored the importance of objectivity.

Former Senator Denton stated that the college
students who acted on their opposit'on to the
American involvement in the Vietnam conflict
had been misled by their professors and the
press. He decried their ‘‘loss of objectivity,’’ and
thanked the crowd for being different, for sup-
porting the war effort. Then Mr. Denton told the
crowd that had the students of the 1960’s been
like the students of today, the United States
would have prevailed in the Vietnam conflict.

Perhaps Mr. Denton was correct; perhaps the
outcome of the Vietnam conflict would have
been different had the students not stood up for
what they believed in. But maybe if they had all
gone to the beach, as some of the Washington
and Lee students of Mr. Cribb’s (W&L °70) era
did, President Johnson would have run for office
in 1968 and won. And as Mr. Denton implied,
he would be dead had this happened, for it was
President Nixon aggressive policy that saved his
life.

Objectivity...

Sincerely,
Gregory Thatcher Densen, '9

More to French

‘Sexy, Erotic & Titillating...”’ I cannot
begin to express my gratitude to the Spectator
for the positive publicity for my course ‘‘Women
and the Creative Arts,’’ as well as to the many
of you who have since expressed interest in
adding the course even at this late date. Unfortu-

nately, this course is reserved for the University
Scholars.

However, I also enjoy teaching a course in
the literature of the French Enlightenment where
we contemplate the philosophy of the Marquis
de Sade and the moral degradation that results
from illicit love. In preparation for Fancy Dress,
my students and I are currently profiting from a
course in French Classicism where the tension
between passion and the French honor code is
the topic of the day.

This is only a small sampling of the wide
variety of courses available to our French majors,
certified experts in the affairs of the heart. The
French are a romantic people, and we in the
Department of Romance (!) Languages are proud
to uphold that tradition.

The registrar has assured me that the sexy
and erotic among you can consider adding a
French major at any point in your college career.
Your petition to the Executive Committee is due
in Dean Peppers’ office by noon on Monday of
the week in which itis to be considered. But
hurry. Space is limited.

‘Hui pleads guilty

to drug charges

 

By Scott Bronstein
Staff Reporter

 

Former Washington and Lee soph-
omore Ulysses Hui pleaded guilty at
a preliminary hearing Tuesday to
charges of importing hashish and
possessing marijuana.

Hui, who withdrew from W&L
last week, was in Federal District
Court in Roanoke to face charges
stemming from his attempt to send
hashish from his home in Hong Kong
to his post office box in Lexington in
January.

He was charged with felony

.counts of importation of a controlled

substance and importation under false
bill and one misdemeanor count of
possession of marijuana.

Both felony charges carry a maxi-
mum five-year sentence, but the
controlled substance charge also car-
ries a mandatory two-year supervised
release penalty and a maximum
$250,000 fine. The importation under
a false bill charge has a maximum
$10,000 fine, and the misdemeanor
charge of possession of marijuana
carries a possible one-year jail sen-
tence and a fine of up to $1,000.

During the hearing, the prosecu-
tion called federal customs agent
David Borden as its only witness.
Borden, the officer who arrested Hui
at the Sigma Phi Epsilon house on
January 10, testified he received
information from customs officials in
Anchorage, Alaska.

He said they had intercepted a
Federal Express package that con-
tained hashish, a concentrated form of
marijuana, as it entered the country in
Anchorage on its way from Hong
Kong to Lexington.

Borden said agents in Anchorage
became suspicious of the package
when they noticed it was addressed to
a post office box number, since Fed-
eral Express does not deliver to P.O.
boxes.

Hui had listed the package as con-
taining cassettes when he mailed it
from Hong Kong. When officials
searched the package, they found
hashish inside a plastic cassette box.

Hui addressed the package to
W&L junior George Benson, one of
his fraternity brothers, but sent it to
his own P.O. box. The package also
listed a phone number registered in
Hui’s name.

Borden called the phone number on
the package, and Hui told him he
could deliver the package to the SPE
house. Borden went to SPE dis-
guised as a Federal Express delivery
man, and arrested Hui after he signed
for the package.

Borden then searched Hui, and
found a hash pipe and a small
amount of marijuana in his pockets.

A later search of Hui’s room uncov-
ered 74 grams of marijuana in a
Ziploc bag in his refrigerator.
Borden said Hui told him that he
purchased the hashish in Hong Kong
for $120. He said Hui refused to tell
authorities where he had purchased

the marijuana found in his room, but
did said he bought it in Lexington.

Borden explained under cross-
examination that he did not find any
scales or large amounts of money
that might have indicated Hui was
planning to distribute the marijuana.
He said Hui told authorities that all
the drugs found were for his own
personal use.

Judge James Turk reduced Hui’s
bail from a $150,000 property bond
to a $10,000 cash bond. He was
released into the custody of his moth-
er, who has flown to the U.S from
Hong Kong and rented an apartment
in Lexington. The court also man-

dated that Hui take a drug test before -

his sentencing date.

Hui’s attorney, David Natkin of
Lexington, said that he has a good
feeling about the sentencing.

“We're very optimistic that Ulys-
ses will receive a suspended sen-
tence,’’ Natkin said after the hearing.
“If he goes to jail at all, it should
be a very light sentence.’’

Superdance earns $30,000

The Washington and Lee
Superdance for the Muscular Dystro-
phy Association raised over $30,000.

Superdance Chairman Kennon
Walthall said the money raised sur-
passed the original goal, but actual
figures will not be ready until late
this week. :

Fraternity attendance was down,
while sororities brought in more
money than in previous years, Faculty

Advisor Fontanne Bostic said.

The Superdance Committee was
particularly pleased with contributions
made by several student organiza-
tions. The Executive Committee and
the Student Activities Board both
contributed over $1,000, and the
Student Telephone Union gave $500.

Saturday’s concert with Drivin’
and Cryin’ sold over 900 tickets and
raised almost $8,000, Bostic said.
Cho won the contest with Soul Kitch-
en in a close second. Both played
Saturday night because the scheduled
band was in a car accident.

Female
to join
C-School
faculty

Oliver to fill
accounting slot

 

By Pat Lopes
Editor

 

The Commerce School has hired
its first tenure-tracked female profes-
sor.

Elizabeth Goad Oliver, currently a
doctoral candidate at Texas A&M,
has accepted a position as an assis-
tant professor in accounting, C-School
Dean Larry C. Peppers announced
last Tuesday.

She will fill a position left open
by accounting Prof. Jay D. Cook,
who retires in June after 38 years in
the C-School.

“‘What appealed to us most of all
was the fact that she had a back-
ground in English literature. She
really convinced us that she had an
understanding of a liberal arts col-
lege,’’ Peppers said.

Oliver, a native of Fort Worth,
Texas, earned a bachelor’s degree in
English literature from Mary Baldwin
College in 1972. She went on to earn
a master’s degree in the same subject
from the University of Kansas.

It was there she met her husband,
Bill, who was a student in the same
program. After their graduation, her
husband went on to the University of
Virginia for a doctorate degree in
English.

Meanwhile, in her work with a
small company, Oliver took an ac-
counting course to help her prepare
budgets. Oliver said she enjoyed the
class so much that for her next de-
gree she switched from English to
Accounting.

It is likely Bill Oliver will be
offered a part-time teaching position
next year, said English Department
Chairman Edwin D. Craun. Both
Craun and Prof. Demaree C. Peck are
planning sabbaticals starting in the
fall.

However, Craun said the universi-
ty did not offer the Olivers a package
deal with positions for both.

MY VIEW
By H.E. ‘‘Buddy”’’ Derrick

 

During recent city council elections, the candidates
running for office heard from the citizens of Lex-
ington that the cost of living in the city was
rapidly becoming prohibitive, especially to our low
and moderate income residents.

In response to that trend, the council began a
‘concerted effort last spring to reduce some of the
higher taxes, such as real estate and personal
property. The council also sought to redistribute
other financial burdens such as water and sewer
fees and the commercial utility tax.

In addition, council asked the city’s constitn-
tional officers — the commissioner of revenue and
the treasurer — to become more aggressive in
assessing and collecting taxes legally due the city.
The personal property tax is one such tax that has
not been aggressively pursued in the past few years

because of staff shortages in the commissioner of
revenue’s office.

The council agreed to pursue this action for the
following reasons:

1. The city’s tax burden is falling more and
more on property owners, thus driving up the
already extremely high cost of housing. More than
58 percent of the city’s assessed value is tax
exempt. The two tax exempt institutions — VMI
and W&L — make up the majority of that proper-
ly.

2. Equity. Students comprise approximately 40
percent of our population but, in general, do not
pay real estate taxes which comprise approximately
30 percent of our revenues. Yet, students receive
significant services from the city such as road
maintenance, fire, police, and rescue services, etc.

3. State law is clear that this tax should be
collected on all vehicles housed in Lexington for
the majority of the year.

The City Council does not look at this issue as
one in which they are targeting students for some

punitive reason. It is an issue of equity. In the
hard fiscal climate we presently face, all segments
of our community must shoulder the burden of
supporting municipal services.

We consider W&L and VMI to be the cormer-
stones of our city and highly value the faculty,
staff, and students as integral components of that
community. Part of the responsibilities of being
citizens is to support governmental services through
taxes. No one likes to pay taxes, but they are a
reality that cannot be ignored.

The City Council requests your understanding
of this issue and hopes that a boycott of our down-
town businesses — the greatest supporters of
students — will not be revisited.

We encourage you to bring your concerms
directly to the city council or the city manager and
help us to make Lexington a better place for all of
us.

The Lexington City Council meets the first and
third Thursday of every month at 8 p.m. in the
Courtroom in City Hall.

Spring term review
delayed another month

 

By Marcy Brown
Staff Reporter

The debate is still raging on the
relative merits and drawbacks of
W&L's Spring Term, so the commit
tee established to review the situation
will not submit its suggestions until
at least the end of February.

According to Chairman H. Thom-
as Williams, Prof. of Physics, the
committee, which is composed of two
students and nine professors, spent
Fall Term collecting and interpreting
information and opinions from faculty
and students. Actual discussion began
after Christmas and has taken longer
than expected, he said.

‘‘We had intended to have our

report ready by the first of Kebru-
ary, = si oi Bot OP at
persuaded everyone on the committee
has had their chance at the podium.
We're really still debating.’’

According to committee member
Hampden H. Smith, Prof. of Journal-
ism, the debate is an old one that
keeps coming up.

‘‘Ever since this thing was estab-
lished, the same people have basically
taken the same sides. Some faculty
continue to be unhappy about not
being able to get everything essential
into their fall and winter classes, and
there is also the perception that Spr-
ing Term is an academic disaster,”’
said Smith. ‘‘On the other side,
you've got departments shouting
about opportunities they can’t offer

anytime but Spring Term."’

Smith said that what the commit-
tee hopes to do is come up with
suggestions that would reduce the
level and frequency of the debate.

“If I had to guess, I would say
the actual calendar of twelve, twelve,
and six weeks would not change,"’
said Smith. ‘‘But our committee will
make some sort of suggestions about
adjusting certain things about the
term, perhaps to the specific depart-
ments. We just don’t know what the
nature of those suggestions will be
right now.”’

According to Williams, whatever
suggestions the committee does make
will probably not affect Spring Term
for a few years.

Eastside principal

preaches self-help |

 

By Steve Fugitte
Staff Reporter

 

Joe Clark preached a message of
self-reliance and determination to a
packed house at Lee Chapel, Monday
night.

“Success is failure turned inside
out,’’ Clark said. ‘‘If you want some-
thing done, get off your rusty-dusty
and do it yourself.’’

Clark put his words into action
when he reformed Eastside High in
Newark, New Jersey.

When Clark took over Eastside in
1982, it was one of the state’s worst
schools, a showcase of drugs and
violence that had become the signa-
ture of inner-city Newark. Clark
replaced drugs and violence with law
and order, tuming Eastside into a
model school in only two years.

Clark, who often refers to himself
as a ‘‘poor black welfare child who
made good,’’ seemed pleased with
himself and the rewards that he has
received from his American success
story.

He joked openly with the
audience about his fame, which in-
cludes a Time magazine cover and a
Warner Brothers movie about his
reign at Eastside, Lean on Me.

But Clark did not dwell on his
successes, choosing instead to address
topics he sees as more pressing,

including America’s ailing public
education system.
Clark advocated a voucher system

of education that would allow parents —
to choose the school their children ;

attend, while being taxed accordingly.
He denounced desegregation, forced
busing and admission quotas.

“Black people have the intellec-
tual capacity to compete
anybody,’’ Clark said. ‘‘When we
lower standards to help black stu-
dents, what we are saying is that
these students are unable to
compete.””

Clark pointed out domestic
problems of a political nature as well.

“We have become a nation of
squabbling nationalities,’’ said Clark,
referring to Americans’ propensity for
seemingly endless debate. ‘‘Let us
meet at an oasis of cerebral under-
standing and cooperation.”’

Clark stressed that people had
become hung-up on the names and
titles given to different races.

“If I call you a white cracker
honky and you turn around, you’re a
white cracker honky,’’ Clark said.

“It’s not what they call you, it’s
what you answer to.

“‘Why are you worried about your
color? We are all brothers and we
must work together in a spirit of
cooperation.”’

Hoping for a strong finish

_ “Everyone remembers how you
‘finish,"’ said Washington and Lee
head basketball coach Verne Canfield.

“You can flounder, but if you
‘finish strong,’’ said Canfield, ‘‘that’s
how you'll be remembered.”’

The W&L basketball team has
floundered during the 1990-91 season,
but with Tuesday’s 96-72 win over
‘Old Dominion Athletic Conference

rival Eastern Mennonite, the Generals
are making a run to finish strong.

W&L is now 11-13, 7-9 in the
ODAC.
Senior forward Craig Hatfield

scored 13 of his team-high 15 points
in the first six minutes of the game
as W&L jumped out to a 48-38 half-
time lead over the Royals, who are
currently tied for eighth place with
Lynchburg in the ODAC standings.

After EMC’s Gary Chupp hit a
three-pointer to start the second half,
W&L went on an 11-0 run to open
up a 58-41 lead capped by senior Pat
Gallavan’s three-point basket to put
the game away. Senior center Chris
Jacobs added four points during the
run.

W&L placed five players in dou-

15 points and 11 rebounds. Jacobs, in
his first start since Jan. 22, scored 14
points along with Gallavan, who hit
four three-pointers. Senior Ed Hart

SPORTS NOTEBOOK

  

 

The

Washington and Lee
indoor track team was unable to
place in any event at the Virginia
Tech All Comers meet this past
weekend, but the Generals did
have some fine performances.

Senior Catherine Caldwell’s
2:41 in the 800 meters was the
best ever indoor time by a W&L
woman in that event.

Freshman Stephanie Brown ran
a W&L-record 65 seconds in the
4 x 400-meter run, while class-
mate Wendy Neel was one-tenth
of a second off the school record
in the 55 meters with her time of
7.8.

“Once again, I thought we
performed extremely well against
Division I athletes,’’ said
women’s head coach John Tucker.
‘We are getting a good idea of
where we want to be and what it
will take to get us there.”’

The next meet for the men

Sophomore John Conkling and the women is the Old Domin-
finished third at 190 pounds with ion Athletic Conference Champi-
a pin in his consolation-round onships in Lynchburg on February

From Staff Reports

 

Junior Peer Soderberg finished
second and three other Washing-
ton and Lee wrestlers finished
third in their weight classes as the
Generals finished last in the Vir-
ginia State Championships at the
Warmer Center last Weekend.

Soderberg, W&L’s 177-pound
wrestler, improved his record to
14-9 and recorded his seventh
pin, but damaged tendons and
ligaments in his knee. The injury
will keep Soderberg from compet-
ing at the Eastern Regionals in
Albany, New York, this weekend.

Seniors Larry Pilkey and Bill
Avery both finished third at 126
and 158 pounds, respectively.
Pilkey, who finished the tourna-
ment with two wins, will compete
at the Eastern Regionals.

The Phi’s encyclopedic sampling of
restaurants for you and your date

 

 

By Pamela Kelley
Entertainment Editor

Fancy Dress is March 8, and although now may seem too soon for
some to begin thinking about getting a date, it is certainly the time to begin
thinking of restaurant reservations. In the southwest region of Virginia there
are many eateries that can more than adequately cater to your Fancy Dress
dining needs. Tucked away in Charlottesville, Staunton, Lexington, Lynchburg
and Roanoke are some great dining establishments. This article was adapted
from a similar piece written several years ago describing favorite restaurants
of Fancy Dress dining parties and it seems some of the oldies are still
goodies. Bon Appetit!

Charlottesville

The Boar's Head Inn, Route 250 W., 1.5 miles off Route 29, 804-296-2181.
Located in a posh region of Albemarle County, the Boar’s Head Inn serves
as both an 174 room inn and a restaurant. Though the menu lacks interna-
tional flare they do serve duck. The glory of the Boar’s Inn is solid
American cuisine prepared impeccably. Prices of entrees range from $14.95
to $24.95. A full bar with a good selection of wines will accompany a meal
nicely. Reservations and jackets for men are required.

The Ivy Inn, 2244 Old Ivy Road (across from Ivy Gardens, one mile from
University of Virginia), 804-977-1222.

Dine by candlelight in this restored large house, built circa 1803. The
‘menu at the Ivy Inn varies greatly, including chicken, beef and veal. Prices
range from $12.75 to $17.95. The romantic atmosphere requires casual dress.
All spirits are served.

The C&O Restaurant, 515 E. Water, 804-971-7044.

This may be one of Charlottesville’s and southwest Virginia’s, most
enjoyable and unique restaurants. At the C&O Restaurant, the emphasis of
the dining experience is on the food (‘‘the focus of the senses’’) and as such
the formal dining room (coat and tie requested ) is decorated all white: white
linens, and freshly painted white walls with white floors. The French cuisine
is served a la carte but unlike European restaurants the portions are large.
Don't pass up the opportunity to enjoy your meal with a bottle of wine from
the C&O’s extensive wine cellar which has been voted one of the top 100
in the nation by Wine Spectator magazine. Entree prices range form $18.25

‘to $28. There are two seating for dinner, the first at 6:30 and the second at
9:30 p.m.

The Ring-tum Phi, February 14, 1991

Roanoke
The Library, 3117 Franklin Road (in Piccadilly Square), 985-0811.

The Library is a beautiful, quaint French restaurant that offers continental
cuisine and an excellent atmosphere. The service is perfect as is the extensive
menu complete with seafood, beef, lamb and veal dishes that will delight the
palate of even the pickiest eaters. If you can stand it, leave room for the
dessert tray which will both amaze and delight. Entrees will run anywhere
from $15.50 to $26.00. The Library is possibly the finest restaurant in
Roanoke and definitely one of the finest in the state according to Virginia:
A History and Guide.

La Maison, 5732 Airport Road, 366-2444.

The elegance of La Maison is evident even. before you enter the front
door. Once a Georgian mansion, the beautiful structure now contains 15
dining rooms in which delicious French cuisine is served. French veal and
lamb are generally the order of the day but American fare of beef and
seafood are also served. Entrees run generally between $8.95 and $30 with
$15.95 as the average. Dress is optional but a coat and tie are recommended.
Dinner is served Monday through Saturday from 5:00 to 11:00 p.m. or later
on weekends. Reservations are recommended.

Lexington
The Willson-Walker House, 30 N. Main St., Lexington 463-3020.
The Willson-Walker House is similar to old inn ding. There are several

rooms which add to its coziness and eliminate much of the hustle and bustle
of large one-room restaurants. Cocktails, beer and wine will complement your

meal. The menu is strong with beef, seafood and chicken dishes. Entrees are
prepared a variety of different ways, including Southern American. The
location is a plus and convenience in choosing the restaurant for its walking
distance from most parts of town. Prices range form around $11 to $16.95.

Reservations are a must during Fancy Dress and coat and tie are recom-
mended.

Maple Hall, Route 11 and 81, Lexington, 463-4666.

Maple Hall is a beautiful large country home converted into a restaurant.
There are several small dining rooms decorated in impeccable colonial taste.
Maple Hall does have a private room reserved for larger parties. The menu
will vary from day to day but a patron can always count on high quality
service and fine country dining. Again the convenience in the Lexington area
is obvious, Seating times are at 5:30 P.M. and 8:30 P.M. Reservations are
appreciated! and coat and tie is recommended.

Hunan Garden, East Nelson Street, Lexington, 463-3330.

This, Lexington’s only Chinese restaurant (and the only Oriental restaurant
since the demise several years ago of the legendary Aloha Wok) opened in
April of 1988. Students have varying opinions of the establishment --- some
think it offers respectable Chinese cuisine (particularly taking into account the
fact that it is located int he hear of the Shenandoah Valley). The Hunan
offers a variety of Chinese dishes, and combinations, and even gives you a
fortune cookie at the end of your meal. They also serve mixed drinks and
several spirits. Dress is casual.

Il Palazzo
North Main Street, Lexington, 464-5800

Il Palazzo, which recently opened to the Washington and Lee community,
offers fine Italian cuisine. Opened seven days a week, the restaurant serves
dishes from pizza pie and calzones to a full dinner menu of tempting dishes
like chicken parmesan. Wine, beer and mixed beverages are also served. The

Harb's Bistro
Washington Street, Lexington ‘

Harb’s, located in the old Lloyd’s building has not yet opened, although
the owner hopes to make it available to the Fancy Dress crowd. This esta-
blishment will be a European-style cafe, which offers cappucino and ,
expresso, as well as homemade breads desserts, etc. Jazz music will be piped
into the stylishly remodeled restaurant to provide a stimulating and relaxing
atmosphere. An English-style game room is also planned. Plans for a beer
garden and more are underway. Keep an eye out for the opening of this chic
new eatery.

Staunton
Buckhorn Inn, 12 miles west of Staunton, Route 250 W. Churchville, 337-
6900

The Buckhorn Inn is a very casual restaurant connected with a 200-year-
old inn. It serves a $12.50 seafood buffet on Friday. Enjoy beef, wine and
a lot to eat between the hours of 4 and 9 p.m. Two of the restaurant’s
biggest specialties are fried oysters and pork tenderloin. Their peanut butter
pie is also popular. Reservations are not necessary but you may want to call
ahead to be sure. :
The White Star Mill, 1 Mill St., 884-3409.

Truly one of the finer establishments around. The While Star Mill is not
cheap but is definitely worth it for the tremendous variety of soups. Desserts
are a la carte and plentiful but the entrees are the bill of the day. Pasta, beef,
all types of seafood, and Cajun dishes are prepared in impeccable detail and
taste. An evening at the White Star Mill for two including drinks could run
around $100.

The Belle Grae Inn, 515 W. Frederick St. (Downtown), 886-5151.

The Bell Grae Inn contains two dining facilities, one is a bistro and the
other a more formal dining room located in the old inn. Currently the two
dining rooms offer the same menu, alt.ough their atmospheres differ. A fresh
selection of entrees is offered daily according to the chef's choices. Entrees
include prime rib, chicken, pork and swordfish. Prices range from $9.50 to
$19.50. A full bar will add an additional price per drink. Coat and tie are
advised and reservations are suggested.

Lynchburg
Emil’'s, Boonsboro Shopping Center, Route 501 North, 804-384-3311.

Emil’s is reportedly wonderful, probably as many Sweet Brian girls can
attest. Emil’s serves lunch and dinner in its two dining rooms. The menu is
varied and enticing. All ingredients are fresh. Emil’s dining room specialties
include flaming entrees, Norwegian salmon, and their rack of lamb dinners
carved for two. Liquor, beer and wine are served. Dinner prices of entrees
start at around $12, the average being about $15. There is no strict dress
code and reservations are recommended.

Sachiko’s International Restaurant, 126 Old Grave Mill Road, 804-237-5655.

Beef, seafood, veal, lamb and chicken dishes all prepared in a great variety
of international styles will certainly satisfy a number of different tastes.
Prices range from $10.95 to $24.95. Excellent service and a full complement
of spirits will help carry the evening. Sachiko’s is an elegant restaurant and
requires coat and tie as well as reservations.
