IFC still
debating
keg rule

By Courtney Hall
Staff Reporter

 

 

Debate continues on the Inter-
fraternity Council’s proposal to ban
, Kegs from fraternity houses.

Two weeks ago, the Alumni Frat-
ermnity Council recommended that the
IFC make a no-keg rule part of its
constitutional by-laws.

IFC President Goodloe Lewis said
at Tuesday night’s meeting that, as it
stands now, every fraternity has either
a national or a house corporation
policy that does not allow kegs or
other communal sources of alcohol in
the house. However, he said that the
existing no-keg rules are not getting
proper enforcement by the IFC.

According to Lewis, if the rule is
passed, a fraternity caught with a keg
in its house is likely to receive social
probation, a fine, or both.

Lewis said that fraternities can
conceivably have kegs now through
means like ‘‘pooling’’ money from
each member to collectively buy a
keg.

“I’m trying to get kegs out of
fraternity houses no matter how they
were bought,’’ Lewis said, ‘‘and
trying to keep kegs out of fraternity-
sponsored events.’’

Sigma Chi President Charles Ed-
wards said that he felt adopting a no-
keg rule would make little real dif-
ference, except that having kegs
would now be an IFC violation in
addition to other penalties already
enforced by house corporations.

Lewis said that the new rule
would not stop ‘‘a few guys from
buying a keg and inviting a few
friends over,’’ but said that if a party
is announced at a chapter meeting, it
would then be considered a chapter
function and would violate the rule.

Discussion of the no-keg policy
was again tabled, and voting will
begin next week.

“This rule is long overdue by the
IFC,’’ Lewis said. ‘‘It should have
been done two years ago. We can’t
keep putting it off.”’

Spring term
safe for now

 

By Tracey Thornblade
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee is planning
no immediate change in the spring
term calendar, according to Spring
Term Evaluation Committee Chairman
H. Thomas Williams.

The committee will make recom-
mendations on possible calendar
changes after it reviews the results
from an evaluation it will start in the
next few weeks, Williams said.

Williams, a W&L physics profes-
sor, said the committee will soon dis-
tribute a questionnaire to students and
faculty to aid in its assessment of
spring term.

In addition to the student and
faculty surveys, the committee will
evaluate spring term course offerings,
and the number of students who opt
to study abroad or to participate in
off-campus internships during spring
term.

The committee also hopes to
study reports from other schools, such
as Davidson, Rhodes and Bates, that

have recently discussed changing or
that have changed their calendars.

Williams said the committee,
which was formed this fall, is
studying the strengths and weaknesses
of spring term, rather than discussing
changes in W&L’s calendar. The
committee will report its findings in
February, 1991.

According to Williams, if the
committee finds its study shows that
spring term is positive, the calendar
will remain intact. If the report finds
that spring term is not being utilized
to its full potential, the committee
will suggest moderate changes, such
as implementing new courses and
modifying existing courses. Finally,
if the report finds that spring term is
no longer viable, the committee will
suggest that W&L change its calen-
dar.

Williams added that even if the
committee does find the current aca-
demic calendar unsatisfactory, it will
be at least two years before changes
could be implemented. The Board of
Trustees would first have to approve
the change, and all departments

would need to restructure their curric-
ula to fit a longer term.

This is not the first tme a com-
mittee has studied spring term’s ef-
fectiveness, In 1973, three years after
W&L implemented spring term, a
committee was also appointed to
determine its success.

Williams said he believes the
university must evaluate spring term
periodically to see if it continues to
respond to the university’s needs.

Community leaders say they don’t

‘want students to move out of their

neighborhoods, but would like them
to be better neighbors.

Rev. J.B. Harris, president of the
Rockbridge Area chapter of the
National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People says

it seems ‘‘students have been
somewhat unleashed on the
community.”’

Harris, a resident of the Diamond
Hill section of Lexington, says ‘‘basi-
cally students have been reasonable’’
but sometimes ‘‘they tend to forget
there are other people in the neigh-
borhood.”’

Harris said problems in the city
include loud parties, parking on the
wrong side of the street, and throw-
ing trash on other people’s property.
At a recent meeting, Harris told the
Lexington City Council he had seen
a student urinating in someone’s yard.

Harris is also concerned about the
number of students moving into the
low-income section of town. In order
to counter that situation, Harris has
proposed W&L rent vacant dorm

Alcohol survey results released

 

By Craig Burke
Staff Reporter

A survey of Washington and Lee freshmen
showed a large percentage of them have at least
one relative in the family with an alcohol problem,
which puts them in jeopardy of developing a
similar problem, Associate Dean of Students Anne

C. Schroer-Lamont said.

Results of the survey on drug and alcohol use,
taken by Washington and Lee freshmen in January
of 1990, were released last week in conjunction

with Alcohol Awareness Week.

The Office of Student Affairs decided to re-
release the survey in order to heighten awareness
of the drug and alcohol situation on the W&L
campus. ‘‘This survey is valuable in that it gives
us some information about the drug and alcohol
habits on our campus,’’ Schroer-Lamont said.

Of the women surveyed, 47 percent said they

had at least one relative who was an alcoholic, and
37 percent of the men admitted the same.

‘I was surprised by the population of students
whose families have drinking problems,’’ Schroer-
Lamont said. ‘‘This is particularly frightening
because we now know that if a person has a
family member who is an alcoholic, that person
has a predisposition to alcohol problems.’’

A large number of students also admitted
forgetting what they had done the night before
after consuming alcohol. This is a characteristic
that indicates a person is heading for trouble with
alcohol, according to Schroer-Lamont.

Also of concern to Schroer-Lamont were the
percentage of students, male and female, who en-
gaged in sex that they regretted while under the
influence of alcohol and the increased tolerance
levels of students since they had arrived at W&L.

After observing drug and alcohol surveys from
other southeastern universities, Dean of Students
David Howison said alcohol and drug use at W&L

is similar to patterns at other comparable small,
liberal arts schools. Last year’s surveys also show
a improvement over previous surveys taken at
W&L. Howison is
decreases in the number of student arrests and in
the number of students sent to the hospital due to
alcohol consumption show a greater sensitivity to
extreme drinking.

The university administration views the survey
as a starting point for increased education about
drugs and alcohol and plans to conduct follow-up
surveys to chart improvement.

Dean Schroer-Lamont strongly encourages all
W&L organizations to become involved in the
campaign to educate the student body. ‘‘The mon-
ey the organizations provide us with is great, but
we really need increased participation. | want to
see the student body address policies and educa-
tion more directly.

leery about

‘Greek

By Pamela Kelley
Staff Reporter

 

 

Fraternity and sorority members
have criticized Washington and Lee’s
impending ‘‘Greek Member Fee,’’
which will require all members to
pay between $100 and $400 a year.

The fee stems from the uni-
versity’s Fraternity Renaissance Pro-
gram. Under the program, the univer-
sity will spend about $11 million
renovating most of W&L’s 16 frater-
nity to the houses and compliance
with new standards imposed by the
administration.

Some Greeks said they were con-
fused because they did not know
about the fee until two or three
weeks ago.

Panhellenic Council President
Nancy Mitchell said there must have
been a lack of communication be-
tween the council and the administra-
tion because she wasn’t familiar with
the fee until a Panhellenic meeting
three weeks ago. Sorority money will
accumulate in a fund to pay for the
renovation of the old university the-
ater, which will house sorority offices
and meeting space.

Chris Baradel, a member of Pi
Kappa Alpha, said he found out last
Monday about the fee. ‘‘I wasn’t
really paying attention. I just noticed
the bottom line: we’ve got to pay X
amount of money.”’

Sigma Nu Chapter President Hunt-
er Catlett said he was also unaware
of the fee, although he added, ‘‘I just
send my bills home.’’

Interfraternity Council President
and Fraternity Renaissance Steering
Committee member Goodloe Lewis
remembered hearing last year about
financial implications from the Re-
naissance in a forum with Tom Touc-
hton, chairman of the Board of Trust-
ees’ campus life committee. But no

Fee’

financial specifics were mentioned, he
said.

Associate Dean of Students for
Greek Affairs Buddy Atkins, who
advises the IFC and Panhellenic
Council said he reminded council
members last year of the impending
fees. According to Kappa Sigma’s
Treasurer Charles Kranich, some
fraternity officers may have known
last year but graduated without telling
fraternities any specifics.

W&L Treasurer Lawrence Broom-
all said the Renaissance and its re-
quirements were discussed in many
forums with fraternity members, al-
though some of the financial terms
might have been vague.

“If I had it to do over I'd be
sure we communicated it better.’’
Broomall conceded that sororities
were incorporated into the overall
program about a year ago, so ‘‘its
conceivable they wouldn’t know as
much as some fraternities.”’

Last week Broomall said the fee
was not a matter of choice. ‘‘All
Greeks are participating in the Re-
naissance,’’ he said, because all must
comply with the university’s new
fraternity standards. Broomall also
said the fee has nothing to do with
whether fraternities apply to the uni-
versity for financing of their physical
renovation.

Currently all fraternities except
Chi Psi and Phi Gamma Delta plan
to participate in the program.

Chi Psi Treasurer Joe Milcoff,
however, said the fee was a total
shock, Chi Psi members are financing
the $150,000 in renovations necessary
for their house to comply with uni-
versity standards, he said, but all
under the impression they would have
no financial obligation to the univer-
sity.

Milcoff cited a press release is-
sued by the W&L News Office on

solutions sought

space to local residents who cannot
find other housing due to the student
influx.

“*The net effect is that when two,
three or four hundred students live in
the city, they are taking up houses
that could be used for people who
live in the community.

‘There has to be an alternative.
People in the community have to
have somewhere to go.”’

As part of his proposal Harris
believes the city should contribute
$100 per month towards utility ser-
vice for the residents who would live
in the dorms.

When asked if he thinks the city
is partially responsible for the hous-
ing situation, Harris responded,
‘“‘Let’s answer that question with
another question ~ who was it that
passed the ordinance [allowing more
than four unrelated persons to live
together with a permit]?’’

Dean of Students David Howison
recently met with Harris to discuss
matters concerning the university and
the city and said they shared ‘‘com-
mon concerns.”’

Howison said when ‘‘students live
in the community, they become a part
of the neighborhood. It’s important to
respect that truth.’’

Meanwhile, Rockbridge County
officials say they have similar con-
cerns about students living in the
county.

H.E. Neal, member of the Rock-
bridge County Board of Supervisors,
said students living in the county
need to ‘‘extend a good neighbor
policy.”’

He said his concerns include loud
parties and student cars parked on the
side of the road where they are a
danger to motorists.

‘Disturbing the peace and having
a police officer come to the property
is not what a student wants,’’ said
Neal.

Neal said, ‘‘If this is viewed as
being hypercritical at the college, it’s
not. People at the college have a lot
of fine things.

‘‘Students are good for this area...
It would be stupid to bash students,’’
said Neal. ‘‘Likewise, the students
have to realize they live in a commu-
nity.”’

Neal recommended, ‘‘When there
are parties, make sure they are not
going to disturb neighbors.’’ He said
there generally needs to be more
courtesy on behalf of all students.

‘It only takes a few idiots to
screw it up for everyone else.’’

-OPINION
| Spring term’s
reevaluation

The administration has formed a committee whose sole
purpose is to ‘‘reevaluate’’ the effectiveness and necessity of
spring term in the academic calendar. Translation: the Hill
is considering eliminating what is possibly the most unique
of many unique features of Washington and Lee.

Spring term was begun 20 years ago as a noble
experiment in a new kind of learning. Because students were
required to take only three credits during spring term, they
could take challenging, in-depth classes that require more
than attendance at lectures. In addition, the new term
allowed the school to add several new programs, such as
internships, study abroad, etc.

If W&L were to revert to a semester schedule, we fear
most, if not all, of these special programs and opportunities
would be lost. The only losers in this eventuality would be
students.

Professors complain that students take spring term too

lightly, and are unwilling to study. Also, they say, many iy a ateect ZB Athy
4 A (, ; fL 4
id W

YY,

   

 

 
 
   

  

departments cannot offer the kinds of specialized classes that
spring term was supposed to encourage. So, let’s just call
the whole thing off.

That, in our opinion, would be a mistake. We live in an
age where education is being standardized at almost all
levels. What keeps Washington and Lee ahead of the game
is our ability to remain unique, different than the cookie-

  

 

  

      
  

 

 

  

 

 
  

cutter universities where each student is known primarily by LS eT], T>
his Social Security number. Spring term offers W&L : AGH, of,
students rare opportunities. For example, the journalism , «, a! “2
department offers a wide range of internships at newspapers ! (Chk 70 Fe /

around the area. The politics department offers the ye sar ey

Washington D.C. intemship. Students can study in Spain, \Y ‘ “G/N fy A J/ fi ip LYS YY
France, or any of several other countries. i ae

Is that not what a liberal arts education is all about? A
chance to learn what real life is like, be it at the Richmond
Times-Dispatch or in Paris, is invaluable to any student.

It would be foolish to say that every W&L student took
advantage of these opportunities. The solution to springtime
apathy is not to change the schedule, however. As one
professor has said, the easiest way to get students to pay
attention is to give out a few lousv grades. Hit them where
they live, as it were.

Spring term has become an important part of W&L.
Those who take advantage of the opportunities it offers can
find themselves in the catbird seat when it comes time to
find a job or a graduate school.

In the last issue of The Washington and Lee Alumni
Magazine, a letter to the editor decried what he called the
“changing of the school from a specialty purveyor of
education to one of supermarket status.’’ In our opinion, to
eliminate spring term would be a large step in that direction.

Phi article
contains racial
stereotypes

I was greatly disturbed when I read the
*‘Lloyd’s fights gang image’’ article last week.
It is an understatement to say that it was a
horrendous job of reporting. It was filled with
numerous racial _ stereotypes, misquotes,
speculations, etc.

Why was the word ‘‘black’’ mentioned five
times? , Is;this-qbjective*reporting?’ One does not

have tbe <a journalisin-major -fo know. hata *

reporter must be unbiased. ‘Nevertheless, this
reporter repeatedly mentioned race, where it had
no relevance.

Would anyone like to define ‘‘gang’’ for me?
The reporter used this term five times. Yet, he
never once defined the term. One can only
conclude from this article that his definition of
gang referred to a group of black Lexington
residents hanging out together. Kate Bailey and
Karen Halsell said they were afraid to go to
Lloyd’s because of the ‘‘gangs.’’ Can they
elaborate? I go to Lloyd’s every weekend, but
somehow I[ seem to miss the gangs each time.
If these ‘‘gangs’’ existed, I would be scared too.
A ‘‘gang’’ is a terror to everyone-- white and
black. Does the reporter ever base his usage of
the term ‘‘gang’’ on facts-- not speculation or
fear of students?

Robert Rorrer, the Lloyd’s employee who was
cited extensively, was misquoted a number of
times. He, as well as the rest of the Lexington
residents, know that L-Posse is a myth. He also
told me that many of his statements were taken
out of context, and of one of the statements he
did not even say. Do not take my word for it,
ask him for yourself.

We have one of the best journalism schools
in the nation. I hope this article was not a
reflection of it. This article only gave student
perspectives-- not black  Lexingtonian
perspectives. I guess they are all supposed to be
gang members. The two violent incidents
involving students and locals gave entirely
student perspectives. What about the other side?
I guess they are all supposed to be gang
members. Why were the black Lexingtonians not
asked their opinion on these ‘‘gangs’’? I guess
they are all supposed to be gang members. I
just hope our journalism department produces
reporters that base their articles on unbiased,
solid evidence-- not speculation.

Sincerely,
Ted Smith ’92

KA ruling is a
miscarriage of
justice

The administration has committed a grievous
injustice against the brothers of the Kappa Alpha
fraternity. Before we expound upon _ this
miscarriage of justice, it must initially be said
that, being independents who have had little
contact with KA, we hold no biased opinion for
or against the fraternity.

We readily admit the fact that we are not as
wise in the arena of college administration as the
average upperclassman or any one of W&L’s
legion of deans, for we are especially confused
when it comes to the operations of the various
committees and subcommittees which apparently
were created to fill very similar bureaucratic
vacuums, if not totally identical ones.

Nevertheless, we find it difficult to fathom
that the administration blatantly disregarded KA’s
apparently reasonable right to be present at their

 

LETTER

own condemnation. Charles Manson, Ted Bundy,
and Marion Barry were present at their trials.
Even if one were as guilty as one of
aforementioned triumvirate, it would seem
illogical for pronunciation of guilt to occur in
absentia. It seems roughly akin to that travesty
of antiquity, taxation without representation.
Another point that needs to be made is that
the SAC apparently neglected to conduct their
own investigation, instead relying on the verdict
of the two organizations that dealt with the
situation prior to them. Imagine the uproar of
popular outrage if testimony from one trial were
to be admitted as the only source of information
in another hearing conducted by a completely
different organization. This practice is

 
  

Alumni Weekend. His latest letter, too, has
brought absolutely no response.

The second letter you received on Oct. 12
was from me. I stated the obvious, that if a
given fraternity is not being renovated under the
Fraternity Renaissance Program, it should not be
held responsible for costs incurred by the
renovation of other fraternity houses. I stated that
I cannot justify billing my brothers for the
rebuilding of ‘‘Red Square.’’ Likewise, they
cannot understand why they are being billed for
renovations to other fraternities. Additionally, no
member was informed of this ‘‘Greek Fee’’ prior
to Oct. 4, 1990. I closed my letter by requesting
*‘some sort of communication on this issue.”’

Mr. Broomall, / am still waiting for this

abominable for it implies the agsumptiop.that.tbe ,communication. os, «

agcuged is guilty. until/preven inocent,.a concept

which is affathema ‘to” fly reagomiable ‘Syteitiof ”

justice. But, it seems to us that W&L does not

seem to possess a reasonable system of justice.

We also question the necessity of the punitive
measures levied against KA by the SAC. It
would seem that they should be whistled for a
fifteen yard penalty for ‘‘piling on’’. The Kappa
Alpha Housing Committee dealt with the problem
as they saw fit, as did the IFC. Perhaps Dean
Howison is feeling impotent in his new position
and is attempting to satisfy his egocentric
cravings by having the SAC run pell-mell
through the fraternal ranks.

For those erudite readers who noticed that we
failed to mention the heinous transgression
perpetrated by KA, it is the most absurd element '
of this whole sordid affair: their only sin was
the damaging of their own property.

Sincerely,
Karl Bucus and Eric Young '94

Chi Psi
refuses to pay
“Greek tax”

To Mr. Lawrence Broomall, W&L Treasurer:

As Treasurer of the Alpha Omicron Delta of
Chi Psi, I received a letter from you, dated Oct.
4, regarding a $100 per member per year ‘‘Greek
Fee.’’ In this letter, you informed me to add this
to the Winter 1991 billing, due Oct. 22. You
closed the letter with the following: ‘‘Please let
me know if you have any questions or concerns
about this procedure or the new fee..I will be
happy to meet with you o your chapter if
necessary.”’

On Oct. 12, you received two letters from
Chi Psi officers. Andrew J. Dewing, our Alumni
House Corporation President, sent a 14-page
letter to you, expressing our displeasure at being
shocked by this ‘‘Greek Fee.’’ It included
university press releases and documentation
representing the ‘‘voluntary’’ nature of the
program. As a regular at meetings regarding the
Fraternity Renaissance Program over the last
three years, Mr. Dewing never heard mention of
this fee, other than the $400 fee which would be
paid by those houses participating in the
program. In his letter to you, Mr. Dewing states,
‘‘Again, I will offer to meet with you George
Ray, Frank Parsons, Buddy Atkins, or any other
appropriate individual to discuss these topics."’
Why does Mr. Dewing use ‘‘again’’ to begin this

offer? Recent history provides the answer. Over
the past two years, our Alumni Presidents have
been requesting meetings and communication
with little or no response. In Dec. 1988, at the
very beginning of the Renaissance Program, then-
President Henry Dewing requested a meeting
with you. Since that time, you have never
responded with an offer to meet with any
representatives of the Alumni Corporation. On
Jan. 30, Andrew Dewing sent a letter to you
pertaining to lease agreements. He did not
receive a response until May 10, the day before

“ The*sirfiple fact i$-that this ‘‘Greek Fee’’ for
ndn-RenaisSance participants was not mentioned
before late September, 1990. Dr. George Ray,
our faculty advisor, and a member of the
Fraternity Renaissance Steering Committee,
recalled no discussion of this fee prior to this
fall, during the week of Sept. 17.

Mr. Broomall, you made it known in the Phi
that the ‘‘Greek Fee’’ was part of the ‘Standards
of Fraternities,’ and non-compliance with the
standards would result in the loss of charter. This
“Greek Fee’’ has never been included in the
standards, and your thinly-veiled threat of loss of
charter is nothing less than attempted extortion.

It is the UNANIMOUS position of both the
Brotherhood and the Alumni Corporation of
Alpha Omicron Delta of Chi Psi that this fee will
not be paid. There is as much justification for
making members of Chi Psi pay this fee as there
is charging it to independents. Why stop this
communization at the Greek system? Perhaps
every member of the W&L community should
pay this fee. Then, we could add student from
the various women’s colleges in the area. They
too have received benefits from fraternities.
Somehow, though, I do not think they would
agree to pay this fee. Neither should we.

Sincerely,
Joseph P. Milcoff, ’92
Treasurer, AOD of Chi Psi

Greek tax an
extra financial
burden

I thought that I would be able to make it
through my four years here at W&L without
having to write a letter to the Phi, but with last
week’s article, ‘‘Hill to charge Greeks up to
$400’’, that’s not possible. I am writing to voice
my displeasure in the university’s attempt to
impose a $100 ‘‘head tax’’ on those fraternities
who are not participating in the Renaissance
Program. Mr. Broomall states that it ‘‘has
nothing to do with whether they’re applying to
the university for financing of their physical
renovation.’’ This is simply not the case, it is
absurd for those fraternities who are taking the
burden of their renovations on themselves to pay
an extra ‘‘greek fee’’ to help pay the renovations
of other houses. At least the sororities’ money
will accumulate to pay for the later construction
of their own houses. If there are any fraternities
not seeking financing for renovations then it is
not a ‘‘system-wide correction’’ and should not
be financed as such. Mr. Broomall also attempts
to say that the refusal to pay such a fee would
warrant having their charters revoked, however
my fraternity will not pay a fee that we had no
say in and does not benefit us in the least, and
in fact by placing extra financial burden on us
hinders our attempt to comply with the
‘Standards for Fraternities.”’

Sincerely,
Andrew Manson

OPINION

Race relations around campus:
The psychology of the white W&L student

 

MY VIEW

By James Rambeau

 

Because of the events that have
transpired during the past six weeks,
I am compelled to express my
sentiments regarding race relations,
both on campus and in the Lexington
community. The Ring-tum Phi has
on several occasions perpetuated
negative images of black people,
particularly those living in the
Lexington area.

In the article entitled ‘‘Lloyd’s
fights gang image’’ in last week’s
Phi, I was particularly disappointed in
the group of freshman girls who ‘‘felt
very uncomfortable as a group of
black youths loitered outside Lloyd’s
Restaurant.’’ I can not speak for the
fears of those girls, but as a black
American I am forced to speak on
the image surrounding black people.

Blacks are portrayed negatively in
American _ society. For every
occasion that General Colin Powell
appears on the nightly news, there is
another occasion where blacks are
viewed in poverty, as gang members,
and violent savages who possess no
regard for the sanctity of life.
Unfortunately, last week’s Phi only
heightened the fear of any W&L
student going to Lloyd’s again.

My first problem with the article
concerns the unfair labelling of those
teenagers as delinquents. How may
the Phi characterize those teenagers
as delinquents when both Lloyd
Smith and the Lexington Police
Department dismissed those teenagers
as youths playing video games?

Moreover, the Phi article
described members of the L-Posse as
those blacks having flattop haircuts
and wearing L.A. Raiders caps.
What is the point? Are we to
assume that blacks not fitting this
description are slightly less prone to
violence? Personally, I own an L.A.

Raiders cap and am indeed a fan of
that team. Should I too be classified
as a member of the L-Posse? What
are the further implications of those
youths wearing flattop haircuts?
Should I suggest to Wendell or
Poindexter (local barbers) that they

should cease to cut hair in such a
fashion because of the negative
images associated with the flattop
haircut?

Underlying this, there is 4
perception that any time blacks gather
in groups of three or more, they are
considered a bunch of gang members
who seek to spread havoc throughout
the town. That is the case in the Phi
article and it serves as a larger
reflection of how society views
blacks in general.

Equally as important, the Phi
seems to further agitate the race issue
by referring to two __ incidents
occurring in September 1989 and
December 1989. Why the reference
to the past? Because attendance at
Lloyd’s is down this academic year,
why does the Phi refer to specific
incidents occurring ten months ago,
in particular last fall term?

There is a perception
that any time blacks
gather in groups of
three or more, they
are considered a
bunch of gang
members who seek
to spread havoc
throughout the town.

In the article, it is rather obvious
that Mr. Smith and the Lexington
Police Department are extending
commendable efforts to combat the
very serious and dangerous problem
of loitering. I sure wouldn’t want to
see a bunch of black youths
‘*hanging out’’ either.

With that in mind, I am forced to
remember those gangs of white
teenagers who ‘‘hung out’’ at
Amold’s in the television series
‘‘Happy Days.’’ Sure enough, they
were a bunch of rough riders who sat
in their booths discussing how they
were going to attack someone
returning from a fraternity party.

Obviously, conflicts exist in
college towns. The conflicts arise
not only from a position of race but
class as well. Consider those youths

 

The Ring-tum Phi, October 25, 1990

reside in a town where there are few
opportunities for advancement. They
may graduate from high school with
a diploma to work at the bus factory
in Buena Vista, perform menial-
salaried jobs in town particularly on
one of the college campuses, or
venture forty miles to the west in
Covington to work at Westvaco (a
pulp mill). Not a lot of room for
self-explanation.

 

It is distressing to
realize that W&L
students refuse to
frequent a business
where black youths
“loiter.” It is
segregation in
reverse.

In contrast, there are a bunch of
college students between the ages of
17 and 26 of whom the majority are
from upper-middle-class backgrounds,
These college students expand their
educational horizons so that the world
may offer them limitless opportunities
upon graduation. Because these
college students live in Lexington for
only four to seven years, they are
viewed as rich intruders. Because of
their comfortable backgrounds, these
college students are viewed living the
dream that the local youths and their
parents so fervently desire but lack
adequate resources to do so.

I suppose you are still wondering
why the W&L admissions department
works so strenuously to attract
minority students with strong
academic reputations.

In addition, the majority of black
Students are from middle-class
background and are viewed in that
light by some locals. Because of
those factors (both environmental and
financial), conflicts will arise between
locals and college students. There
are other people residing in Lexington
besides college students.

The article in last week’s Phi
should have focused on class conflict
and the psychology of the white
W&L student. It is distressing to

 

realize that W&L students refuse to
frequent a business where black youth
“‘loiter.’’ It is segregation in reverse.
In the words of Mr. Lloyd Smith,
“They’re just a bunch of fourteen
year-olds. What are they going to do
to you?”’

The fraternity renaissance issue
should have been further explored
especially its implications on Mr.
Smith’s business. As the construction
crews renovate fraternity houses in
Red Square, there should be an
expected decline in clientele because
of students not living in those houses
and the lack of parties in Red Square
that normally attracts students to
Lloyd’s.

The Minority Students Association
has worked diligently in coordinating
its efforts with the community to
alleviate some of the problems in
Lexington, particularly those of race
and class. Some MSA members
serve as big brothers and big sisters
to those threatening youths in the Phi
article. In addition, a few more
MSA members also tutor some of
those youth in their academic studies.
The MSA sponsors activities for their
younger siblings such as the annual
Christmas Gift Party and Easter
Basket Party. You will see their
parents attend our Martin Luther King
Celebration held at First Baptist
Church in January.

I implore you to talk with both
MSA members and the parents of the
youth at the aforementioned events.
In fact, several of their relatives are
employees at W&L.

I believe it should be noted that
several MSA members are white and
that our activities have been attended
by white locals on a consistent basis.
I fervently believe that no matter how
diligently Mr. Lloyd Smith tries to
combat the negative ‘‘gang’’ image
of his restaurant, that image will
persist due to the white student’s
image of black people.

Mr. Smith, the problem rests not
in your restaurant and its frequent
customers who play video games
(instead of listening to the jukebox
like the gang at Amold’s), but it rests
within the psychology of the white
W&L student and his/her perceptions
of black people.

Private schools and free speech

 

 

MY VIEW
By Niv Goldberg

 

I like to speak. Anyone who knows me knows
that I like to shoot my mouth off at just about any
topic that comes up in conversation. Anyone that
knows me also usually disagrees with me about
most things. But that’s okay, because I have the
right to say what I please, and they have a right to
disagree with me.

Living in the United States, people are pro-
tected by the Constitution and the amendments
thereto. Some people however, believe that free
speech is threatened on campuses around the
nation. Not only threatened, but actually violated
by certain procedural actions taken by universities.
This all refers to speech of ‘‘offensive’’ nature in
regard to race, sex, and a number of other at-
tributes people possess.

The question being brought up is, does the
university have a right to reprimand people based

 

Interviews and photos
by Amanda Hughen

on what they say? The answer is ‘‘sometimes,’’
and the distinction of ‘‘when’’ is clear.

The logic goes as such: the Constitution works
as a basis for the government, and when it
provides specific rights for the individual citizen,
it provides those rights in opposition to government
power over said citizen. This means that public
institution, including public universities, cannot
discriminate along the lines of speech.

I would argue therefore, for example, that the
University of Virginia could not act against an
offending speaker except for a private request to
not spout such offensive material again. The
university could not, based upon the speaker’s
offensiveness in speech, discriminate against the
speaker in official policy.

A private institution, however, is a different
matter. A private entity has the right to refuse to
listen to anything it does not want to hear. The
entity does not have to house the offending
speaker, or provide the speaker with any private-
ly-sponsored services.

Take, for example, pubs, which often have

people thrown off their premises for being insulting
and threatening. The private university, as a private
entity, has the same right. This is not to say that
throwing someone off campus is the correct thing
to do, but it is a right reserved by private entities
in the United States, of which private universities
are a group.

Imagine being in your home, with someone you
have recently met, when this person begins acting
in a manner you do not approve of, and insults
everything you hold dear. You have every right to
throw this person out of your home.

The campus (assuming it is privately-held land)
is the home of the private university, and that
university has the right to throw out those who
offend it. Again, this is not to say that the above
is the correct action. Very often, listening to this
type of offensive material leads to healthy debate,
peaceful resolution, and ignominy for the offensive
instigator.

However, the right of the private university to
expel, or otherwise punish, offending members of
its community exists, and must be recognized,

EC places
in student

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Executive Committee issued
a final budget allocation list Monday
night which added last year’s $16,000
surplus to the $5,500 Student Body
Working Reserve.

EC members last week realized
that the 1989-90 surplus of $16,216
had not been allocated with the
$185,250 in anticipated 1990-91 stu-
dent activities fees. EC Vice Presi-
dent Raymond Welder handed out
copies last night of allocation lists for
the last two years, showing that hold-
ing the surplus in reserve is custom-
ary.

The EC renewed its invitation to
“student organizations to appear
before the EC and request for any
future financial needs at any time.”’

In an attempt to improve its im-
age in the community, the Interfra-
ternity Council will sponsor a com-
munity service project on Halloween
night.

IFC is requiring each fraternity to
send at least two members to serve
as trick-or-treat escorts for Lexington
community children Wednesday night.
The Greek escorts will operate out of
Fairfax Lounge, where parents can
wait while their children are escorted
trick-or-treating through town.

surplus

reported to the EC the results of a
survey in which 151 of the 386
freshmen rated the Honor System
orientation on a four point scale.

Five respondents rated the meeting
as “Poot,” 15 ts ‘Fir: 36. as
‘‘Good,’’ and 93 as ‘‘Excellent.’’ The
primary criticisms of the Honor Sys-
tem orientation were, on the negative
side, that it was not stressed enough,
and, on the positive, it explained an
important part of student life.

The EC appointed student repre-
sentatives to university committees
Monday night. Lee Garlove, Freder-
ick Renneker and Tim Downes will
sit on the Athletic Committee; Chris
Dreibilbis, Todd Ammermann and
Cathryn Lopiccolo on Library Advi-
sory; Charles Daniel, Katherine
Kreutziger and Matt Jackson on Stu-
dent Health; and Electra Martin on
the Faculty Executive Committee.
Rick Sumner will serve the Cold
Check Committee.

trick-or-treat

IFC member John Flippen said
that the first escort group will leave

at 5 p.m. and new groups will depart
in thirty-minute intervals.

According to Flippen, trick-or-
treating routes will run out Lee Ave-
nue and in the neighborhood behind
Sigma Phi Epsilon and Phi Gamma
Delta. He asked Lee Avenue frater-
nity houses to have candy and decor-
ations ready.

IFC President Goodloe Lewis
supported the program. ‘‘Community
relations are very important, especial-
ly this year, because fraternities have
such a bad reputation in the com-
munity,’’ said Lewis.

The university’s published ‘‘Stan-

mention sororities or the Panhellenic

deter freshmen from going Greek.
Broomall and Atkins both said
they don’t think the fee will be a
problem. Because the fee is university
imposed, they said, some type of
financial aid or special arrangement
might be worked out. Atkins said
next year the fee will be listed in the
W&L catalogue along with tuition,
board and other activity fees.
Broomall and Atkins said the fees
will not have much impact on indi-
viduals. Some houses — such as those
in the renovation program who will
no longer pay mortgages, land rent or
property taxes — might end up pay-
ing less than in previous years.
Mitchell said other complaints
centered around sororities being as-

sessed the fee without representation
on the Student Affairs Committee.
Fraternities are represented on the co-
mmittee, but the SAC voted not to
allow sororities membership last year.
Atkins encouraged a sorority seat on
the committee last year and hopes
this year sororities will be allowed
membership.

Like other university expenses, the
Member Fee may increase ‘‘if costs
go up,’ Broomall said. The fee was
originally set at $500 until he re-
structured it to $400, he said.

The Alumni Fraternity Council,
composed of W&L alumni fraternity
and sorority representatives, will keep
check on the university’s manage-
ment of the Greek revenue.

Hollins to one shot. Stimeling did not
have to make a save.

Freshman midfielder Corinda
Hankins scored the only goal of the
game with 33:41 left to play in the
game. She scored from 25 yards out,

For the second straight week, the
Washington and Lee defense helped
the offense overcome a slow start as

the Generals rallied to top the
Sewanee Tigers 17-0.
With the shut-out, the W&L

defense has not been scored on in
over seven quarters and has forced 10
turnovers over that span.

Saturday against Sewanee, the
offense again was shut out in the first
half, but the defense kept the
Sewanee offense off the board.

To start the second half, the
Generals took control of the game.
On second down from the W&L 49,

Recently, games ending in over-
time with the score 2-1 have meant
defeat for the Washington and Lee
men’s soccer team.

But on Tuesday at Liberty Hall
Field, it was the Generals’ turn to
capture a 2-1 overtime victory as they
defeated Hampden-Sydney in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference tourna-
ment quarterfinals.

down from the W&L 31, the Tigers
tried a reverse.

Junior defensive end Scott
Williamson hit David Merrell 12
yards behind the line of scrimmage
and forced a fumble. Sophomore
defensive tackle Thomas May for the
Generals.

Renneker quickly hit senior
tailback Mason Pope for a gain of 21
to get the drive going, and later kept
the drive alive with a  six-yard
completion to Pope on fourth down
and three. A third completion to Pope
put the ball on the Sewanee five-
yard line.

After a time out, Renneker looked
for and found junior tight end Brian
Hodges wide open in the end zone
for a touchdown and a 10-0 W&L
lead.

W&L put the game on ice in the
fourth quarter with a big defensive
play and a trick offensive play of its
own. On third down for Sewanee,
junior defensive end John McCallum
sacked Scott Thompson, forcing a
punt.

A holding penalty forced the

Mitchem received a pass from class-
mate Greg Williams 30 yards from

The Purple Prince is back!

Prince’s funk/rock style unifies songs on his lastest album

 

By Carli Flippen
Staff Reporter

 

Prince’s new album, Graffiti
Bridge, while continuing the stylistic
experiments of post albums, is one of
his most exciting records since Purple
Rain.

The double-album length record
covers territory from radio ready hits,
such as ‘‘Thieves in the Temple,’ to
an odd burlesque of the blues entitled
‘The Question of U.’’ The diversity
of sound is enhanced by Prince’s use
of several guest singers, including
George Clinton, Mavis Staples, and
Tevin Campbell. The reformed Time
tumn-up to perform four heavy-funk
numbers penned for by Prince. Prince
unifies the album’s myriad styles by
treating all the songs with the distinc-
tive funk/rock sound which has
marked his recordings since 1999.

Graffiti Bridge opens with five
songs, each covering distinctly dif-
ferent styles, each excellently written
and would be the high point of most
other albums. The first, ‘‘I Can’t
Stop This Feeling I’ve got,’’ is an up
tempo rocker, complete with fuzz
guitar and driving rhythm. This
would not be a surprising choice for
the second single.

The second song, ‘‘New Power
Generations,’’ is a funky rocker
which recalls scme of the better
songs on his 1988 release, Lovesexy.
The Time then step in to pound-out
the heavy-funk of ‘‘Release It.’’ The
growling bass and heavy groove
make ‘‘Release It’’ as infectious a
dance song as Prince has written,
rivaling songs like ‘‘Housequake’’
from Sign 'O the Times.

The fourth song is ‘‘The Question
of U.’’ The song is based on a lum-
bering traditional blues structure. Yet,

The Ring-tum Phi, October 25, 1990

the over heavy bass and drums plus
weird arranging and instrumentation,
such as a harpsichord solo, create the
feeling that Prince is parodying the
blues. At the same time, his haunting
melody makes the song oddly beauti-
ful.

‘Elephants and Flowers’’ is the
fifth song on the record. It recalls
some of the paisley psychedelic ex-
periments of Prince’s Around the
World in a Day. However, the bass-
drum groove never let it stay too far
from the roots of Prince’s funk
sound.

The rest of the album progresses
in a similar manner sampling various
styles, yet always keeping an eye on

the funk/rock sound that made Prince
famous. Twelve-year-old Tevin
Campbell belts out ‘‘Round and

Round”’ as if he has been doing this
as long as veteran gospel singer
Mavis Staples, who lends her talents

to the song ‘‘Melody Cool.”’

One week point on the record is
the song ‘‘We Can Funk’’ with Geo-
rge Clinton. The song never really
catches fire like a song written by
those two masters of funk should. It
is neither a great song or fantastically
performed.

Another point Prince has occa-
sionally been criticized for, is his
lyrics. On Graffiti Bridge, Prince
alternates between advocating some
kind of narcissistic behavior, seeking
salvation, and suggesting that in some
way the two go together.

Graffiti Bridge brings Prince back
from the completely commercial
venture of his Batman record to the
creative experimentation he’s been
known for lately. At the same time,
he has released his most exciting
album in a long time.

Chess moves on W&L

Community me

 

By Joshua Manning
Staff Reporter

 

Chess, the age-old strategy game,
has finally made its way onto the
Washington and Lee campus. Earlier
this month, W&L’s fledgling Chess
Club began meeting every Tuesday
evening.

The club was the vision of Lex-
ington resident Alan Brownstein, who
serves as de facto advisor for the
group. Brownstein, a longtime chess
player, says the club is absolutely
necessary for a school such as W&L.

“IT would really like to see a
Chess Club at W&L that would meet
regularly without my having to be
there,’’ Brownstein said. ‘‘This is
something that Lexington has never

had.

Brownstein’s long-range goals
include having the club’s responsibili-
ty vested in student officers. ‘‘There
are so many college activities geared
towards  chess,’’ explained
Brownstein. For example, he pointed
out that the United States college
chess team championships is held
somewhere on the east coast every
year. In addition, many other area
schools have competitive student
teams. Teams from the University of
Virginia, JMU, and Virginia Tech
would be more than willing to ar-
range competitions with W&L.

Brownstein is a nationally rated
player on the expert level. His skill
level is estimated at about 2100
(2200 being the threshold of mas-
tery). Brownstein is joined by two

mber starts club to analyze

other chess players from the Lexing-
ton community: Mitchell Davis and
Lowell Cooper. Cooper is a Professor
of Music at Southern Seminary Junior
College in Buena Vista.

Besides playing chess, the club
spends part of its time analyzing the
game. During last Tuesday’s meeting,
the’ group replayed last week’s World
Championship match (game three of
twenty-four) between current champi-
on Garry Kasparov and challenger
Anatoly Karpov. Karpov, the former
champion, and Kasparov are generally,
considered the two best living chess
masters.

The match, which ended in a
draw, was quite unusual, Brownstein
said. Karpov took what seemed to be

chess moves

an early lead. The club debated about
why Kasparov put himself into such
a vulnerable situation. In the end,
they decided that even world champi-
ons can make a mistake. The club
then resolved itself into rotating part-
ners for several rounds of speed
chess. While speed chess was the
variety of choice last Tuesday, the
club is open to any variation of the
game.

The Chess Club meets at 7:00 pm
Tuesdays in the University Center’s
basement offices. : While club
meetings last as late as 11:00, players
are free to come and go as they
please. For more information, feel
free to call Alan Brownstein at 463-
2650. New chess players are always
welcome, he said.
