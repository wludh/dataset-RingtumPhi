LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

JANUARY 24, 1994.

Comer faced with
$15 million lawsuit

 

By John Laney
Staff Reporter

 

The father of Mary Ashley
Scarborough, a W&L freshman who
was killed in a hit and run accident
two years ago, is suing former W&L
student Charles Blakely Comer, the
driver of the car that killed her, for
more than $15 million.

D.E. Scarborough, a_ Raleigh,
N.C., doctor, filed a civil lawsuit in
U.S. District Court in Roanoke on
Friday against Comer, who plead
guilty in August to involuntary man-
slaughter and hit and run in the death
of the 19-year-old Scarborough on
March 16, 1989.

Scarborough, the administrator of
his daughter’s estate, is asking for $5
million in compensatory damages and
$10 million in punitive damages. He
is also asking for the $10,000 in
reward money that he originally
offered as a reward for the identity of
the driver.

“It’s not unusual for people to
file suits like this. They often have a

therapeutic function for — the
plaintiffs,’’ said Judith A. McMor-
row, associate professor of law at
Washington and Lee. ‘‘But the dollar
amounts don’t have much meaning.
The value of life has no market
equivalent.’

Comer, who now attends the
University of Georgia, said he had no
comment about the lawsuit when
questioned yesterday. Comer referred
questions to his father in Greenville,
S.C., who said the defense was being
handled through ‘‘the insurance
company.”’

Comer was released from Rock-
bridge Regional Jail in late Sep-
tember, after serving three of the
required six months of his five-year
sentence,

In the lawsuit, Scarborough char-
ges that Comer was driving under the
influence of alcohol. That, plus his
decision to leave the scene of the
accident, demonstrated ‘‘negligence so
gross, wanton and culpable as to
show a reckless disregard for human
life, including Ms. Scarborough,”’ the
lawsuit continues.

In a statement Comer read at his
trial, he acknowledged that he had
been under the influence of alcohol
when his car struck Scarborough.

‘The beneficiaries have suffered
sorrow, mental anguish, loss of the
decedent’s solace, society compan-
ionship, comfort, guidance, kindly
offices and advice, services, protec-
tion, care and assistance,’’ the suit
says.

“These are all areas that are very
difficult to value in terms of mon-
ey,’’ McMorrow added.

‘*About 90 percent of all personal
injury cases settle out of court,’’ she
said. ‘‘It’s very difficult to say when:
this case will be completed.”

The Scarboroughs lost another
daughter in a 1987 automobile acci-
dent in Wake County, N.C. She was
the passenger in a vehicle that went
off a winding road and hit a tree.
Their son, John, is a sophomore at
Georgetown University.

DG colony folds as Winter Rush ends

 

By Pamela Kelley
Staff Reporter

 

Delta Gamma Women’s Fraterni-
ty announced last Thursday it will
not colonize at Washington and Lee,
after its second attempt at attracting
W&L women to a fourth sorority
failed.

‘*The numbers just weren’t there.
It’s very surprising. I thought we had
a gocd Rush,’’ said DG colony presi-
dent Mignon Crockard.

Crockard said national sorority
representatives decided to fold the
colony after reviewing preference
cards submitted by rushees.

‘“‘W&L wants and needs another
sorority, but it is just not ready,’’ she
said.

DG Executive Director Maggie
Watkins said DG is strong nationally

FD cancellation still

and sought a strong group with ‘‘cer-
tain standards and a good collegiate
number of members’’ at W&L. She
said the number of interested women
was ‘‘not sufficient.’’

‘‘We’re regretful. I do think there
is a loss in it for W&L,’’ said Wat-
kins.

Chapter pledge quotas were set at
34 — the number of women still
participating in Rush after the third
evening of Rush divided by four.

More than 30 women who signed
up for Rush either dropped out on
their own, or did not receive bids.

Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa
Gamma, and Chi Omega filled their
quotas,

Associate Dean of Students for
Greek affairs Leroy ‘‘Buddy ’’ At-
kins told W&L’s Panhellenic Council
Tuesday it should make future exten-
sion decisions very gradually and ‘‘be

careful about rushing to fix things.

‘*‘We must learn from that experi-
ence and create a more favorable
climate for colonization,’ Atkins
said.

He said the goal size for sororities
at W&L is 70 members, and without
another sorority, future pledge classes
could be too large.

That ‘‘could be a problem unless
we find a way to have a successful
colonization,’’ Atkins said.

Atkins added that DG’s attempt to
colonize after an unsuccessful Open
House last year was ‘‘risky and not a
norm.”’

‘The sorority, recognizing the
risks, had been up-front with its
concerns and reservations on Rush,’’
he said.

Atkins also said DG representa-
tives were very cordial when things
did not work out.

“They were not happy about not
succeeding here,’’ Atkins said, ‘‘but
they felt worse about leaving the
interest group behind.”’

Eleven members of the interest
group pledged DG in the fall and
conducted last week’s Rush with help
from DG members from the Universi-
ty of Virginia and Duke University.

According to Watkins, those elev-
en pledges have been given the op-
portunity to become initiated members
of the sorority, or they may de-pledge
DG and participate in Rush next year.

Crockard said she plans to be
initiated at an Alabama DG chapter
in several weeks, and that other pled-
ges are considering initiating at near-
by chapters like Roanoke College or
Virginia Tech.

DG delayed colonization last Janu-
ary after a disappointing turnout at an
open house held after Winter Rush

for the other three sororities was
over, according to DG Colonization
Coordinator Kitty Beatty.

Later that year, DG formally ac-
cepted W&L’s invitation to colonize
after a DG interest group persuaded
national officers to attempt coloni-
zation.

In September, DG held an open
house for interest group members and
unaffiliated upperclass women. At
that time, Colonization Coordinator
Karel Lambell said ‘‘numbers are not
an issue. There’s no set number
we're looking for here.’’

Crockard said she hopes DG will
try colonizing at W&L sometime in
the future, although they’ve ‘‘had a
lot of obstacles to overcome.”’

She said, though, she remains
optimistic.

‘‘We’ll all still be here, wearing
our DG things.’’

War in the Persian Gulf could threaten
Washington and Lee’s 84th Fancy Dress Ball,
according to FD Chairman John Flippen and
Student Activities Board President Katie Duwel.

Flippen and Duwel said preparations
continue for the Ball, but they are mindful of
its possible conflict with the Gulf war.

‘‘As of right now, it doesn’t look like
people would be offended,’’ Duwel said.

Flippen cautioned, however, that ‘‘if the war
continues or worsens,’’ canceling the ball ‘‘is
something we will have to consider.”’

He said he spoke with Vice-Chairwoman
Susan Wooton Sunday night, ‘‘and we agreed
to continue’’ preparations ‘‘for the time being
— and keep one eye on CNN,”’

Fancy Dress was suspended from 1944
through 1946 because of World War II.

If hostilities continue, W&L President John
D. Wilson and Associate Dean of Students and
SAB sponsor Leroy ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins would
make the decision in consultation with the SAB
and the FD Steering Committee, Flippen said.

Atkins said it’s ‘‘a question I haven’t even
thought about yet.’’ He said it would be
discussed at the next SAB meeting. Wilson is

out of town this week and could not be reached
for comment.

Duwel said canceling FD would cost the
SAB ‘‘maybe a couple hundred dollars here and
there.’’

Despite the shadow of war, all FD bands
have been booked, Duwel said. The Kings of
Swing and Buckwheat Zydeco, a New Orleans’
Creole band, will perform Friday, March 8.
The Nelville Brothers had been selected for
Thursday night, but they canceled because of a
conflicting European tour. Another band has
been booked, but Duwel said it will not be
announced until just before Washington holiday.
She added that the SAB will sponsor The
Megaphonics in the Pit that Wednesday night.

This year’s theme will be announced Feb.
28, and tickeis and memorabilia will go on sale
March 4, Duwel said. She said more money is
being spent designing the t-shirt and other
memorabilia, but prices will remain about the
same as last year.

‘Students will be getting overall quality for
about the same amount of money,’’ Duwel said.

Flippen said Gary R.-Humiston, Technical
Director for the University Theatre, is serving
as a decorations consultant to the Steering
Committee. Humiston is helping the Sub
Committee Chairmen plan and _ construct
decorations.

The Executive Committee passed
numerous minor revisions to the White
Book Monday but avoided the most
controversial proposals.

Approved revisions will, if affirmed
by vote again next week, allow three
days for a defendant to prepare for a
closed trial and three days to appeal to
an open trial,

The Honor System previously man-
dated two days for each process.

White Book Revisions Committee
Chairman Claude Worrell called these
two of ‘‘the most significant’’ changes
the EC passed.

The EC did not, however, debate or
vote on the most disputed proposals such
as adding ‘‘or acting dishonorably’’ to
the familiar ‘‘lying, cheating, or steal-
ing;’’ or changing ‘‘dismissed’’ to ‘‘w-
ithdrawn’’ on the transcript of a student
found guilty in open hearing.

“The feeling of the Executive
Committee was that we've got time on
this,’’ said EC President Tom Hatcher,
“so we jumped on the basics."’

Hatcher said he would welcome
further discussion and hopes the WBRC

will continue to work on new proposals
for the controversial issues.

Worrell said the WBRC will review
the as yet undebated proposals at
Monday’s 5 p.m. EC meeting, but he
doubted the EC will consider passing any
of the remaining measures.

‘‘We’re not really going to get any-
where,’’ said Worrell, because no EC
member will change their stance on the
controversial issues.

“I think the EC has forgotten in part
why they were elected and why’’ they
formed the WBRC, he said. ‘‘Yes, the
system is working, but the system could
be better.”’

Senior EC Rep. and 1989-90 EC
President Willard Dumas said that he
called for the formation of the WBRC
last year after open hearings revealed that
‘students had misconceived perceptions
about the Honor System.”’

Dumas said it was ‘‘good’’ for
WBRC members ‘‘to air their concems
and for the Executive Committee to hear
those concerns and see if they were val-
as

The WBRC is not, however, a cross-
section of the student body, he said. ‘‘A
lot’’ of WBRC members are ‘‘people in-
volved with honor proceedings that
believe they had a negative experience.’

Worrell said that he believes EC
members ‘‘are amenable to discussion if
students are concerned,’’ urging such
students to contact their EC represen-
tatives and attend Monday's meeting.

These are some of the WBRC
proposals not yet debated by the EC:

Philosophy

¢ Page 1: clarification that one cannot
‘fact dishonorably by mistake....’’
Enforcement

¢ Paragraph 4: investigative team will
consist of an EC member, a student
body member, and a member of the
Honor Advocate Pool, rather than two
EC members and a student body
member

Procedure for a Closed Hearing

* Section I.B.: investigating member
of the EC is ‘‘disqualified as a sitting
member of the Executive Committee’
for that case

* Section I.C.: two-thirds of the EC
must vote to proceed to closed
hearing, rather than a majority

¢ Section III.K.: guilt in a closed
hearing requires three-fourths the EC
vote rather than two-thirds
Procedure for an Open Hearing

* Section IV.F.: 10 jurors rather than
eight must find guilty for conviction

 

 
 

OPINION

In defense of
offensive speech

On Sunday the Ku Klux Klan held a march through the

nearby city of Blacksburg. Undoubtedly, there are many peo-

, ple on this campus who avidly disagree with the principles
under which the Klan is run. And there are probably those
who whole-heartedly agree. Regardless of one’s personal
opinion on this issue, there is another issue which needs to
be addressed — the First Amendment right of free speech
which protects even groups like the KKK.

The right to free speech cannot be extended only to those
groups whose ideas are palatable to the majority. As
Supreme Court Justice Brennan wrote in his majority
opinion in the flag-burning case Texas v. Johnson, ‘‘If there
is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is
that the government may not prohibit the expression of an
idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or
disagreeable.’” The First Amendment provides blanket
protection for the expression of ideas for all Americans.

It is only through public debate and the conflict of ideas,
some of which society finds noxious and repulsive, that
people can truly form conclusions as to which viewpoints
are most valid. For democracy to work at full efficiency,
opinions from all sides of an issue must be heard. Supreme
Court Justice Brandeis wrote, ‘‘Freedom to think and speak
leads to political truth and all other kinds of truth.”’ It is
through freedom of speech that women and minorities have
been able to overcome deep-seated prejudices and
discrimination to acquire rights and privileges traditionally
reserved for white males. Future advances will also depend
on the availability of ideas and free flow of public debate.

The most effective way to combat prejudice and
ignorance is not to punish their advocates, but rather to
engage them in debate and show them the fallacy of their
positions. For our system of democracy to run smoothly, it
is infinitely preferable to coax those who hold repugnant
views to enlightenment through the sweet sounds of rhetoric
and elocution than to crush them beneath the weight of
censorship.

Once suppression of ideas, no matter how loathsome or
repugnant the ideas may seem, takes hold, people are forced
to express themselves behind closed doors without the
benefit of intelligent rebuttal. What evolves from this is an
oppressive society similar to Hitler’s Germany, Mao’s China
or Stalin’s Russia. To take pride in America is to respect
the rights we are granted. Foremost among these rights is
free expression for everyone.

The KKK upholds principles of hatred, hostility, bigotry,
discrimination and violence. Martin Luther King, with his
brilliant oratory, advocated just the opposite — brotherhood,
fellowship, equality and non-violence. Hopefully, one day
the KKK’s, forum will be outmoded and King’s ideals will
‘be realized, But suppression is not the means to achieving
this goal. Rather, we should allow the Klan to keep voicing
their opinions. Every time a member of the KKK speaks, we
are reminded of what true ignorance is.

Quote of the week

I'd like somebody to mention that day, that Martin Luther
King, Jr., tried to give his life serving others. I'd like for
Somebody to say that day that Martin Luther King, Jr.,
‘tried to love somebody. I want you to say that day, that I
tried to be right on the war question. | want you to be
able to say that day, that I did try to feed the hungry. And
I want you to be able to say that day, that I did try, in my
life, to clothe those who were naked. I want you to say, on
‘that day, that I did try, in my life, to visit those who were
in prison. | want you to say that I tried to love and serve
humanity.

— Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on Feb. 4, 1968 telling
the congregation of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta,
Georgia, how he hoped to be remembered after his death.
He was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee on April 4 of
that year.

Alcohol-Related
Arrests Are
Declining

Assessing student conduct in a college
community is a complex task. The results of
student disciplinary cases, anecdotal incidents,
empirical observations by residence hall staff, and
statistical reports all contribute to an overall
picture of student conduct. That picture is often
cloudy. Occasionally, a single traumatic incident
can create the impression of a wide-spread
conduct problem, that may not exist. In other
situations, a persistent problém may continue
without wide knowledge by the campus
community. Specific disciplinary issues may be
dominant one year and virtually non-existent the
next.

One quantifiable measure of student conduct
at Washington and Lee is the student arrest
record in the City of Lexington. In this area, the
most recent figures for Washington and Lee
students arrested in Lexington for alcohol-related
incidents indicate a positive tread.

In the Fall Term 1988, 65 Washington and
Lee students were arrested in Lexington for
possession of alcoholic beverages/drinking in
public. The total for the Fall Term 1989 was 53.
This past Fall Term 1990, the number dropped to
24, a significant 63% reduction. In the area of
DUI, the number of Washington and Lee students
arrested dropped from 13 in the Fall Term 1988
to 8 this past Fall Term, although 8 DUI arrests
are still 8 too many.

My purpose in conveying this information is
that I believe an awareness of disciplinary issues
is an important factor in promoting responsible
behavior in our community. I hope we can all
work together to live up to the high standards
inherent in the heritage and mission of
Washington and Lee,

Sincerely,
David Howison
Dean of Students

Co-op Credit Is
Not Indefinite

I am writing to inform members of the
University community about a problem we are
having in the snack bar. Over the years we have

had a policy in the Snack Bar that if any
University ‘‘forgot’’ their

member of our

money, we have allowed them to make a

purchase so long as they returned, no later than

the next day, with payment. This liberal policy,

which is based on the honor system, has gotten
out of hand. Every day members of our staff

observe students taking food; candy, ice cream,
and beverages and walking away without making
any effort to pay. In the past, students used to
at least used to inform the cashier that they had
forgotten their money and asked if they could
come back and pay. I have the impression now
that students genuinely believe they do not need
money when they come into the Snack Bar.
Because of our unique honor system, they believe
they can come, take what they want, not tell
anyone and come back and pay at some time
convenient to them. This is not the policy.

The policy is as follows: Any person wishing
to make a purchase in the Snack Bar must do so
with his/her University Card or cash. If a
situation does arise when a member of the
University community finds that upon arriving at
the Snack Bar, they have forgotten their wallet,
they may get in the cashier line, and leave their

name with the cashier and the dollar amount of

the purchase. That person should then come back
and pay within 24 hours. I stress that this must
be the exception and not the rule.

Donald Burch, Manager
Snack Bar

 

LETTERS

Amnesty Boss
Chides Bush

Last week, The Ring-Tum Phi printed a letter
from President Bush concerning America’s role
in the Gulf which made reference to an Amnesty
International report. What follows is an
abbreviated response from John G. Healy,
executive director of Amnesty International
U.S.A.

Amnesty published its report on the Iraqi
Government’s gross human rights violations for
one purpose: to advance the protection of human
rights. By publicizing such abuses, the movement.
generates public pressure and _ international
protest. However, the United States public should
not tolerate selective indignation by its own
government.

Iraqi soldiers’ behavior in Kuwait does not

constitute a sudden shift to the brutal side. Iraqi
civilians have suffered such cruel treatment by
government personnel for more than a decade, as
detailed in numerous Amnesty Intemational
reports. There was no presidential indignation, for
example, in 1989, when Amnesty released its
findings about the torture of Iraqi children. And
just a few weeks before the invasion of Kuwait,
the Bush Administration refused to conclude that
Iraq had engaged in a consistent pattem of gross
human rights violations.

Tomorrow’s tensions in the region may well
be mapped by the human rights records of our
long-term ‘‘friends,’’ such as the Saudi Arabian
Government, and new-found ‘‘friends.’’ such as
the Syrian Government. We’ve heard little from
the United States Government in recent years
about the appalling tactics of repression used in
Saudi Arabia and Syria. Torture and detention
without charge or trial are common in these
countries.

Relentless and ruthless abuses by the Iranian
government continue. More than 5,000 Iranians
have been executed during the last three years.
Incommunicado detention and torture are routine
in Morocco, and that country’s government
persists in responding to ‘‘disappearances’’ with
secrecy and silence. Our government fails to act
with determination against the torture suffered by
tens of thousands of prisoners held in Turkish
jails.

The Egyptian Government has subjected many .

thousands of political prisoners to detention
without charge or trial. The torture of these
prisoners is reportedly common. In the Israeli
Occupied Territories, thousand of Palestinians
have been detained without charge or trial.
Furthermore, Israeli troops, often engaging in
excessive use of force, have killed hundreds of
Palestinian civilians.

Amnesty International takes no position on
the territorial disputes now raging in the Persian
Gulf. But we do support international coalition
building to prevent all egregious human rights
violators from conducting business as usual. If
President Bush is sincere about ‘‘desperately
want[ing] peace,’’ and if he wishes to remove
ambiguity from his invocation of ‘‘moral
obligation,’’ then let him be consistent in his
concern for human rights.

Sincerely,
Geof Smith, Amnesty International Chapter
President

Just-War Theory

Says Don't Kill
Soldiers in Gulf

Given the large number of professed

Christians here at Washington and Lee, it would

be reasonable that the community consider the

justness of every element of this war in the
Persian Gulf. Allow me to point out that during
the development of the Just-War Theory, the
Church never abandoned its

recognition —

intellectually at least — of the absolute principle
that the deliberate taking of innocent human life
is always objectively immoral, no matter what
the circumstances. I contend that the bombing of
Iraqi troops (not missile sites or military
equipment) is a violation of this principle. In my
opinion, the Iraqi soldier who does not pose an
immediate threat to human life should be
regarded as ‘‘innocent.’’ (For those who might
object that a soldier is automatically denied such
a status because of his affiliation with the
military, I ask you to consider that he may have
had no choice in the matter and may even prove
himself to be a pacifist should he be asked to
engage in combat.) Operating under a Just-War
ethic, one should never set out to kill human
beings, although this may be a regrettable
consequence. of using force commensurate with
the threat at hand.

What amazes me most are the so-called Bible
Christians, who seem to feel that as long as the
war can be justified in a broad sense, then any
action to further the aims of the Good Side is
acceptable. Their friend Jesus was no utilitarian.
And a note to those Protestants who feel that
their expression of the Faith is a purification and
a retum to the original, undeveloped form of
Christianity may also be in order: in the first
centuries almost all Christians were strict
pacifists, and in most local churches a soldier
would not be allowed to join the community
unless he promised never to kill another human
being. The first notable theological changes in
this attitude towards participation in the military
by Christians, and hence the origins of the
constantly evolving Just-War Theory, began as
late as the fourth century with the teachings of
St. Ambrose and St. Augustine.

Sincerely,
Daniel M.. Bettendorf, ‘91

A Plea for War to
End Quickly

First of all, I would like to express my
gratitude to all the students who helped with
January 15th’s candle-lighting for peace.
Additionally, I’d like to thank everyone who
stopped to light candles. Your response showed
me that I was not alone in my concern about
what is happening in the Middle East, and I hope
the candles provided something for all those who
saw thém to think about. ;

Sadly, President Bush provided something
much more compelling to think about the next
day. However, I hope we do not overlook the
seriousness of the situation in our initial euphoria
over American successes. I cannot say anything
positive about Saddam Hussein; he is quite
obviously a menace to native Iraqis as well as
the international community. Nor do I ‘wish to
withdraw my support for the Allied troops. I
admire the ability of those men and women to
courageously perform their difficult job, and I
pray that they may be able to return to their
families as safely and as quickly as possible.

Instead, I only wish to again point out the
gravity of the situation, and indeed any situation
that involves such a potential for the loss of
human life. I hope that my fellow students, as
the up-and-coming generation, may be able to
pause and reflect upon how precious human life
is. I hope that it is something that we all take to
heart, because I know it has surely made me
think. And I hope that in the future we learn to
use human resources in creative initiatives to
insure peace instead of risk the loss of life on a
distant battlefield.

In conclusion, I'd like to point out that peace
should not be a dividing issue, for I believe we
are all hoping it will come as soon and as
bloodlessly as possible, no matter what our
political outlook. My prayers are with President
Bush and other world leaders that they may
come to a quick solution to this crisis, and to
those in the Middle East, that they may all be
safe.

Sincerely,
Sharon Widmayer, ‘91

THE SBAR SIDE
By Jon Sbar

 

 

To continue in my efforts at
giving the American public up to the
second updates on major international
developments, I want every one to
know that I have recently volunteered
to participate in a ‘‘study using an
experimental Antifungal Lotion for
JOCK ITCH.”’ The job doesn’t pay
much but I figured it would look
great on a resume. Anyone who is
interested in volunteering for the
study should contact W&L student
Scott Miller (464-5440) for more
information. Keep in mind that
participants ‘‘must be at least 18
years old and have moderate jock itch
with some redness.”’

Now that we’ve gotten that dis-
gusting little joke out of our systems,
we can focus on a real international

said he wants the contest to be fun,
but the underlying purpose should not
be forgotten.

Darrell has been criticized for
imposing stricter rules on costumes,
but he insists the crackdown is not
due to his personal tastes.

Several judges from last year’s
contest expressed concern over the
brief costumes of the Fiji Love Na-

go on to win the W&L competition
and the National Rock Alike Contest,
Darrell said judges pondered over
whether to subtract points for attire.

"Costumes will not be forbidden

Darrell. "The judges have a new set
of criteria, and they will make the
final decisions.”

Washington and Lee began charg-
ing Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Sigma
Nu fraternities the controversial Greek
Membership Fee of $400 annually as
they moved back into their newly
renovated houses this month.

All other fraternities will begin

| paying a reduced annual fee of $100

beginning in September, according to
University Treasurer Lawrence Broo-

1 mall. That number will be raised to

$400 as their houses are completed.
Fraternities not undergoing uni-
versity-sponsored renovations will
continue to pay $100 each year.
Capital generated from this Greek
Fee will be used to underwrite ap-
proximately half the costs of the
Fraternity Renaissance program over
a 30-year period, said Broomall. This

corresponds to the 30-year leases that
the university now guarantees each
individual fraternity.

‘Part of the problem [with the
fee] earlier was in the area of com-
munication,’ Broomall said. ‘‘Now
everyone knows this is coming in
September and they will be prepared
for it.”

Associate Dean of Students for
Greek Affairs Leroy Atkins indicated
that the Greek Fee should not have a
noticeable affect on what fraternity
members had been paying before the
Renaissance began ‘‘unless the frater-
nity had been subsidizing its social
functions with money that should
have been used for operating, the
house’’ since general house fees "will
decrease.

The university will collect the fee
monthly through its own billing sys-
tem. As part of the Fraternity Renais-
sance package, each fraternity uses

It’s a shame that Bush can’t come
right out and express his true feel-
ings, but I guess that’s one of the
disadvantages of being the President
of the United States. I'd wager (your
valuable possessions) that Bush would
quit his job and become an irrespon-
sible college humor writer if he could
keep the Presidential limo and all the
free liquor.

Getting back to the subject of
War in the Persian Gulf or the
Caspian Sea or the Gulf of Mexico
or wherever, I wish everyone in the
world could get along peacefully.
Aren’t we all vulnerable to the same
emotions? Don’t we all feel joy, pain,
love and boredom when CNN keeps
showing the same war news over and
over and over? So why don’t we just
get up and switch the channel over
to Oprah for a typical show about
‘Gay Fathers’ or ‘‘Women who eat
their young?’’

Because we're too damn lazy to
get up and change the station or to
buy batteries for the remote control,
that’s why. Besides, even if we did
switch to Oprah, we couldn’t get
away from the war because her show
would probably be about ‘‘Spouses of

people who might go to Canada if

there’s a draft.’’

‘In spite of the fact that the
television and newspapers are brimm-
ing with news of the war (as well as
weird verbs like ‘brimming’), I’ll bet
that there are thousands of Americans
who don’t even know that the nation
is at war. Of course, most of these
people also live in buffalo herds, so
let’s not be to hard on them.

from topic to topic in this article, I
guess that this would be as good a
time as amy to address the fact that
I am a pacifist. Since I am the type

passive nature should come as no
surprise. But please don’t get the

money from its members.

According to Broomall, the Greek
Fee will appear on the member’s
statements as only part of the fratern-
ity’s monthly fees.

Starting in September, sorority
members will also pay a fee of $100
annually. This money, however, will
not be used to fund the Fraternity
Renaissance program. Instead, it will
be put into a separate fund that will
be used to help provide them with
houses of their own sometime in the
future. Once the sororities move into
these houses, members will pay the
$400 fee.

Although former Panhellenic Pres-
ident Nancy Mitchell does not believe
that the sorority members are pleased
with the prospect of paying the fee,
‘they understand that it is going
towards their houses. It’s just some-
thing that you have to pay.’’

that they hang him upside down by

without using novocaine, and force
him to memorize the Constitution
(including the preamble) and every

junior high school.

In closing, I’d just like to em-

In closing, I’d just like to em-

Police outnumber marchers, protesters

 

By Brian Root
Editor

“What do we want?’ ‘‘White
power in America!’

“‘When do we want it?’’ ‘Right
now!’

‘Who are we?"’ ‘‘KKK!’’

That was the message that the Ku
Klux Klan wanted to get across as
they marched through downtown
Blacksburg Sunday afternoon. The
chant was repeated by the approxi-
mately 30 Klan members who walked
down Blacksburg’s Main Street.

The Klan members weren’t the
only ones who were yelling, how-
ever. ‘‘I can’t believe that the Holy
Spirit would incite you to such ha-
tred and violence,’’ shouted one
Virginia Tech student who stood
about 10 yards from the marchers.

Klan Grand Dragon for Virginia
Larry S. Moore said one of the rea-
sons for the march was to protest the
establishment of Martin Luther King’s
birthday as a national holiday, which
was observed Monday.

‘‘Some of the good people in this
community don’t like the King holi-
day and some of the things going on
at the university, these alliances of
gays and lesbians and the black stu-
dent party,’’ Moore said prior to the
march.

When the Klan originally
announced its intention to march in
Blacksburg in December, several
Virginia Tech student leaders said
they were afraid that there would be
a violent confrontation between some
students and the Klan members.

With that in mind, the Blacksburg
Police Department, with help from
the Montgomery County Sheriff’s
Office and the Virginia State Police,
dispatched about 250 officers for
crowd control.

Although the Blacksburg police
said there was no reported violence,
one man was arrested for carrying a
stun gun in his pocket, and another
was arrested for throwing an egg at

the marchers.

Blacksburg Police Chief Don
Carey said the turnout for the march
was ‘‘amazingly small.’’ Both Virgin-
ia Tech and Blacksburg officials had
urged people to boycott the march.

‘Our black students seem to have
really stayed away,’’ a Tech official
told The Roanoke Times. ‘I’m proud
of them.”’

Because of the planned boycott,
there were no organized plans to
protest.

““Everything’s kind of indepen-
dent. But it’s really important for
people to get out here and show
these jerks how we feel about them,”’
said one woman, who was handing
out placards with the inscription

‘*End Racism.”’

 

! can’t believe this
kind of crap is going
on when there’s a
war happening.

— KKK protester

 

“I can’t believe this kind of crap
is going on when there’s a war hap-
pening,’’ said another protester.

‘‘When I go to bed at night, I
pray that everyone over there comes
home safely. I don’t care whether
he’s black or white, and neither
should they,’’ he said, gesturing to-
ward the marchers.

Before the march could even
begin, however, each Klan member
was subjected to a thorough search,
which included the use of metal
detectors so sensitive that even pocket
change registered.

After each member cleared the
police search, Moore led the group in
a prayer and then gave a short an-
nouncement.

‘‘We’re not here to harass any-
one,’ he said. ‘‘If someone curses
you, just look the other way. We’re
just gonna have a nice, peaceful walk
like we always do.’’

As the Klan made their way
through the streets, protesters shouted
repeated insults. Some of the Klan
members carried cameras to photo-
graph some of the protesters.

A few spectators were there to
support the marchers. One group of
five men waved to the Klan mem-
bers and gave the thumbs-up signal.

Both the Blacksburg and the State’
Police also carried cameras, and ,
carefully videotaped the entire demon-
stration. ‘

According to Carey, the Blacks-
burg police studied videotapes of *
previous demonstrations as part of ,
their preparation for Sunday.

After the march concluded, the *
Klan members gathered in a small
park, where Moore planned to give a”
speech. As he began to speak, his,
words were drowned out by the in-
creasingly vocal crowd. '

When Moore picked up his mega- ,
phone to speak, the crowd erupted
into a chant of ‘‘Go home.’’ Each
time he was interrupted, Moore be-
came visibly angry and shook his fist ,
at different groups of protesters. 4

As the yelling grew louder, the
ring of police officers around the '
Klan members grew larger.

“‘T haven’t seen any big problems
yet,”’ said Officer N.D. Croy of the’
Montgomery County Sheriff's Office. ,
‘‘But you never know.”’

While Moore was speaking, about *
20 state troopers dressed in full riot
gear and carrying automatic weapons :
sat in cars less than 100 yards away. ;

Following the demonstration, the
police escorted the marchers back to '
their cars. As the Klan members ,
began to leave, one was hit by a
crumpled piece of paper from the ‘
crowd, which stood only a few feet ,
away.

The Klan member attempted to?
go into the crowd, but was restrained ‘
by several police officers.

The police followed the three ,
vans out of town, to ensure that the
demonstrators were allowed to leave ‘
safely.

War unlikely for cadets

 

By Marcy Brown
Staff Reporter

It is highly unlikely that any
cadets from Virginia Military In-
Stitute would be called upon before
graduation to join in the fighting
against Iraq, according to VMI Pub-
lic Information Director, Thomas A.
Joynes.

“It takes a national mobilization
and a formal declaration of war bef-
ore anyone can be called up early or
be drafted, and that’s just really un-
likely in this kind of war,’’ said
Joynes. ‘‘Now, if this were a world
war type conflict, this might be an
issue.”’

Joynes explained that the cadets’
only formal military connection is
through ROTC programs like the

BOYCOTT

and Kranich.

“I’m going into this open-minded
and pretty sympathetic’’ to the city,
Hatcher said. ‘‘They need money and
they are looking for legal ways to get

Derrick said parties emerged ‘‘a lot

into the meeting.”’

In the state legislature last week,
the Senate amended and passed a
House bill that included a provision
to end confusion over where proper-
ty tax on student cars should be
collected.

Reports last week that the bill had
gone to the governor for approval
were incorrect. Instead, the amended
measure went back to the House
Monday, was defeated 46 to 48, and
returned to the Senate.

The bill went to a joint confer-
ence committee Wednesday. If the
committee produces a compromise
measure, it must pass both houses in
order to go to the governor for ap-
proval.

The legislation, if passed, ‘‘may
not change the situation,’’ said Ran-
dall Bezanson, dean of the Law
School.

ones at Washington and Lee which
are designed to train commissioned
officers.

‘The Army, the Navy, and the
Air Force would all want students to
finish school and get their commis-
sions,’’ said Joynes. ‘‘They didn’t
take anyone early in World War II
when we were really in desperate
straits, and that’s what we’re going
by now.”

Joynes said there are at least 125
alumni of VMI taking part in Opera-
tion Desert Storm, and probably
many more they don’t know about
yet.

No current cadets have dropped
out to join the fighting, and all are
being encouraged to continue their
studies.

Cadet Paul Meadows, ‘93, said

that Brig. Gen. John Knapp, superin-
tendent of VMI, addressed cadets the
night the United States began air
raids on Baghdad.

‘He basically voiced his support
for the troops and encouraged us to
support the war effort too,”’ said
Meadows. ‘‘He also told us the best
thing for us to do right now is to
stay in school and not get gung-ho
and head off to fight.’’

Meadows said most cadets realize
they need to stay for now, but their
minds are definitely on those who
are engaged in the struggle against
the forces of Iraqi president Saddam
Hussein.

Meadows also said the cadets are
anxious to see what will happen
once ground forces join the air for-
ces in the fighting.

W&L on three-game skid

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

After topping the .500 mark for
the first time this season with a three
game winning streak, the Washington
and Lee basketball team hit its tough-
est stretch of the season.

W&L_ dropped three _ straight
games, all in the Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference and all against teams
ranked in the Division III South
Region. The losses left the Generals
8-9, 4-6 on the season.

Last Thursday, the Generals put
their three game winning streak on
the line against the third-ranked team
in Division III, Emory & Henry.

E&H jumped out to an early lead
behind 14 first-half points from 1990
ODAC Player of the Year Leon Hill,
but the Generals rallied and cut an 11
point lead down to just 46-41 at the
half by scoring four points in the
final second.

Senior center Chris Jacobs (20
points) hit two free throws, and after
the Wasps turned the ball over, senior
forward Ed Hart (22 points) hit a
baseline jumper at the buzzer.

The Generals continued to cut into
the lead when senior guard Mike
Holton hit a three pointer to start the
second half to cut the lead to 46-44.
The Wasps responded by pushing the
lead back out to five points on a
three pointer by Hill.

W&L then tumed to senior guard
Pat Gallavan for a spark. Gallavan,
making his third start of the year,
scored five straight points, and when
Jacobs made a lay-up on the break,
the Generals had tied the game at 59.

After E&H jumped back out to a
71-67 lead, Gallavan (season-high 15
points) hit two straight three pointers
to give the Generals their first lead
since 15-12 in the first half. When
Hart scored off a feed from Holton,
the lead was 79-73 and E&H called
time out.

After the timeout, Derek Elmore
(18 points) hit two. straight three
pointers to spark a 10-4 run to tie the
game at 83. Hart put the Generals
back on top, but Ross Kirtley gave
E&H the lead for good with a three
pointer at 86-85 and the Wasps held
on for a 94-88 win.

“Emory and Henry was ranked
No. 3 in the nation, and we were up
on them,”’ said senior guard Jim
Casey. ‘‘We feel we should have
beaten them.”’

The six point loss was W&L’s
fourth loss in the ODAC by six
points or less. The Generals have lost
six games by six points or less this
season.

“Our first four losses came by a
combined nine points,’’ said Casey.
*““We were playing so-so and losing
close games. If we had played really
well could have won those games.”’

After playing E&H, the Generals
continued their trek through the Divi-
sion III top 10 by playing tenth-ran-
ked Randolph-Macon.

WA&L started strong, getting a 14-
13 lead, but the Yellow Jackets took
control with an 18-2 run sparked by
Jeff Skop (17 points) and Troy Smith
(19 points) hitting foul line jump
shots. The Generals closed the gap to
35-24 at the half despite shooting
only 28 percent from the floor.

‘“‘Our shooting has dropped back
down to where it was at the begin-
ning of the season,’’ said Holton.
‘‘We’re missing some shots inside
that we probably should be making.’’

Holton (19 points) and Hart (16
points) rallied the Generals to within
nine at 42-33 early in the second
half, but the Yellow Jackets got two
three pointers from Jeff Taylor (19
points) to break the game open and
key the Yellow Jackets to an 85-67
win.

‘We just hit a stretch in the first
half where we couldn’t hit anything
from the floor,’’ said Holton. ‘‘Then
we played terrible defense where
nobody could stay with their own
man. We just couldn’t stop anyone.’’

The Generals finished the week
Tuesday night with a game against
Hampden-Sydney, the  sixth-ranked
team in the South Region (E&H and
R-MC aie ranked first and second in
the South Region).

The Tigers opened up a 42-30
halftime lead behind the shooting of
Steve Musilli, making his first start
of the year. Musilli equalled his
career high of 10 in the half. Holton
kept the Generals in the game with
10 points of his own.

To start the second half, head
coach Verne Canfield went with the
line-up of the two captains, Holton
and senior forward Craig Hatfield
(five points) along with junior for-
ward Courtney Penn and sophomores
Keith Faulkner (six points) and Bryan
Watkins (10 points) looking to spark
his team.

“‘Coach [Canfield] was trying to
shake things up,’’ said Casey. ‘‘We
didn’t execute, and Coach will keep
shaking things up until he finds a
group who executes the way he
wants.”’

The five responded by scoring the
first seven points of the half, forcing
the Tigers to call time out leading
42-37. After the time out, Musilli
went back to work, scoring 16 second
half points on the way to a career-
high 26 points as the Tigers jumped
out to a 60-45 lead.

Hart and Penn kept the Generals
close. Hart scored 12 of his team-
high 16 points in the second half and

Penn added eight second-half points.

But the Tigers’ held the Generals to
just nine second-half rebounds and
put the game away 89-72.

‘‘We just played horribly,’ said
Casey. ‘‘We didn’t execute at either
end of the floor at all.’’

Holton says the shake-ups should
continue.

““Coach has made it pretty clear
that if you aren’t playing well, you’ll
sit. He’s going to look for people
who are playing well,’’ he said.

The Generals will look to get
things back on the right track against
Lynchburg in a rare Friday night
home game. After hosting Lynchburg,
the Generals hit the road again, trav-
elling to face Emory & Henry, now
the second-ranked team in Division
Il.

“‘Hopefully we'll be able to find
six or seven guys each game who
will play feally well,’’ said Holton.
“If we do that, we should be able to
win some games.”’

No diving costs swimmers.
in losses at Georgetown

 

By Randall Ellis
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee swim
teams lost their third straight set of
dual meets this past weekend, each
falling to Georgetown. The men were
defeated 119-84, while the women
lost 119-93.

Once again, the Generals lack of
depth and the absence of diving
contributed heavily to their downfall.
By failing to enter the diving portion
of the meets, each team automatically
gave up between nine and 32 points.

Aside from this, head coach Page
Remillard said he thought his teams
swam great.

“It’s hard to keep on saying we
lost, but we are happy anyway,’’ he
said. ‘‘The simple fact is that
Georgetown has a larger squad and is
a Division I team. We know we are
going to take our lumps this year and
this has allowed us to concentrate on
how we want to be swimming at this
stage of the season rather than. how
we want to be swimming in order to
win particular meets.’’

This meet’s events were measured
in meters rather than yards, so a
straight comparison to previous times
is impossible. Remillard said he felt

that with a rough time conversion and
by judging the performances of the
individuals’ swims that times are
consistently falling.

‘I’m pleased with where we are
at this point. We swam the distance
events very well. I think physiologi-
cally we’re where we want to be. We
are looking to see some big time
drops from those who swim the
stroke events (backstroke, breaststroke
and butterfly) in the coming meets,’’
he said.

This weekend’s meet could prove
to be such an occasion as W&L hosts
George Washington University.
Remillard said he was not certain
how W&L would fair.

‘“‘We know little about George
Washington teams,’’ he said. ‘‘They

‘have gone through some changes

recently and are adjusting to a new
coach this year. In addition, the flu
outbreak on campus is going to hurt
us. We have a few swimmers out and
can’t count on them to perform up to
par this weekend. At times like this
our small size can really leave us
vulnerable.’’

The meet, scheduled for 2 p.m.
Saturday in Cy Twombly Pool, will
be the first home meet for both the
men’s (0-3) and women’s (1-3)
teams.

Athletes score big in class, too

 

From W&L Sports Information

i Fifty-six Washington and Lee
University athletes have been named
W&L’s Scholar-Athlete Honor Roll
for the 1990 Fall Tern, Athletic Di-
rector Mike Walsh announced Mon-
day.
* To be named to the Scholar-Ath-
lete Honor Roll, a student must be a
tember of a varsity team and earn a
%.5 grade point average for the cur-
rent term. During the 1989-90 aca-
emic year, a total of 75 students
were named to W&L’s Scholar Ath-

lete Honor Roll.

The list of honorees included
recent Rhodes Scholar recipient Pat
lopes, a four-year letterwinner in
women’s cross country.; senior bas-
ketball co-captain Mike Holton, who
is a two-time Academic All-Ameri-
can; senior men’s tennis co-captain
Bill Meadows, who captured the 1990
NCAA Division III men’s doubles
national championship with partner
John Morris; and junior women’s
soccer standout Nancy Mitchell, an
All-ODAC and All-South Atlantic
region honoree.

‘ Junior Peer Soderberg pinned his
opponent to win the consolation final
apd two other Washington and Lee
wrestlers placed, leading the Generals
t6 a seventh-place finish at the York
Invitational.

’ Soderberg, who pinned Frank
PRommet of William and Mary Col-
lege two minutes and 34 seconds into
his consolation final round match,
finished 3-1, third overall in his 177-
pound weight class. Soderberg ex-
t¢nded his season record to 9-7.

, “Unfortunately, the only guy |
lost to will be back this weekend,”’

said Soderberg, looking ahead to this
weekend’s Washington and Lee Invi-
tational.

Senior co-captain Larry Pilkey and
sophomore Rich Paini also wrestled
well enough to secure slots in the
consolation finals at 126 and 118
pounds, respectively.

Pilkey, who won twice, once with
a technical fall, finished the invita-
tional with nine takedowns, increasing
his team-leading total to 16 on the
season.

Paini recorded two victories, a
pin, and four reversals. Paini’s eight
reversals on the season leads the
squad.

According to head coach Gary
Franke, however, the overall perform-

which had a combined team grade
point average of 3.2999. Nine mem-
bers of the women’s soccer team
were named to the Scholar-Athlete
Honor Roll.

The highest men’s team average
was the men’s cross country team,
which had a combined team grade
point average of 3.147. Five members
of the men’s cross country team were
selected to the Scholar-Athlete Honor
Roll.

ance of his team was disappointing.

‘*T thought that some people were
capable of placing, but didn’t wrestle
up to their potentiai,’’ said Franke.
‘We're not opening up enough. We
need to be a little more aggressive.”’

Franke insists the team’s condi-
tioning level is not a problem. In
preparation for the Generals’ upcom-
ing Invitational, Franke plans to em-
phasize the technical aspects of the
sport.

This weekend W&L will host
seven squads, including Furman,
Davidson, and Messiah, teams the
Generals have already wrestled. Sod-
erberg hopes to avenge his only loss
this past weekend to Messiah’s Bob
Weaver.

While pressure is being put on the
National Football League and the
National Collegiate Athletic Associa-
tion to postpone games until after the
Persian Gulf war settles down, offi-
cials at the Virginia Military Institute
and Washington and Lee say the
games will go on as scheduled.

‘“‘We are very sympathetic about
what is going on in the Persian

Mike Walsh. ‘‘We will take time to

serving a moment of silence before
each game.”’

Davis Babb, the acting AD at
VMI, agreed with Walsh.

‘‘We do observe and will continue
to observe a moment of silence to
remember the troops fighting in the
Persian Gulf,’’ he said.

While the NCAA, NFL and Na-
tional Hockey League have .all been
pressured to consider stopping all
games until the crisis in the Gulf
settles down, Babb said that he had
not heard anyone at VMI wanting to
stop games.

‘‘We have not heard anything at
VMI, either from cadets or alumni,

about stopping contests,’ he said. ‘‘I
think that if there was a movement
to stop contests, I would have heard
about it. But I have heard nothing,
and we will not stop any contests.”’

Teams, both college and profes-
sional, also are showing their support
for the troops by wearing American
Flag patches on their uniforms.

Babb said that while VMI teams .

wear nothing on their uniforms at
present, VMI is considering doing
something to honor the troops.

‘*We are considering doing some-
thing along with the moment of si-
lence to honor those involved in the
war,’ Babb said. ‘‘We may put

Walsh is content that the moment
of silence is the proper way to re-
member the troops in the Persian
Gulf. He doesn’t feel that the uniform
is the best way to support the troops
in the gulf.

“The uniform is not the way to
be constantly reminded of what is
going on,’’ he said. ‘‘We fully sup-
port what is going on and will show
that support through a moment of
silence before each game.”’

War puts sports in
proper perspective

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

 

The Persian Gulf War is the top priority of the world at this time, and
the sports world is no exception. When Operation Desert Storm began,
the games still went on, but the minds of those involved were in the
Gulf.

One college basketball game between North Carolina and North
Carolina State, scheduled for Jan. 16, was postponed and later resched-
uled. North Carolina forward Pete Chilcutt has a brother serving in the
Persian Gulf.

In Annapolis, Md., the Naval Academy was playing the University of
Richmond. When Navy students at the game found out about the attack,
they left immediately.

Navy coach Pete Herrmann found out about the attack just before tip-
off, but did not tell his team until halftime. Former Navy captain Cliff
Rees is presently deployed in the Persian Gulf.

Richmond won the game on two free throws with no time on the
clock, but the moment of triumph was overshadowed by the develop-
ments in the Gulf.

Terry Connolly, the Richmond player who hit the winning shots, said
that he was happy Richmond won, but he couldn’t get excited about the
win because of what was going on overseas.

Jay Schroeder, the quarterback of the Los Angeles Raiders, has a broth-
er who is in the Persian Gulf in the Air Force. Schroeder and some of
his teammates wore the decal of the Air Force squadron in which his
brother serves.

After the North Carolina-N.C. State game was postponed, the
Atlantic Coast Conference announced that all games would go on as
scheduled.

The National Football League announced that the playoffs would
continue and the Super Bowl, scheduled for Jan. 27 in Tampa, Fl., would
be played as scheduled. As a precautionary measure, the NFL and Tampa
Police are increasing security in and around Tampa Stadium.

In the NFL Conference Championship games and the NHL All-Star
game, played on the weekend of Jan. 18-19, fans and teams showed that,
while enjoying themselves at the sporting events, they remembered the
troops in the Gulf.

As the ‘‘Star Spangled Banner’’ was played before the NHL All-Star
game, fans in Chicago Stadium waved American Flags and cheered for
the soldiers in the Gulf. At the NFC Championship game in San
Francisco, the New York Giants wore yellow bands on their arms to re-
member the troops in the Gulf.

Fans at the NHL All Star game held banners that read ‘‘Gls--the Real
All-Stars’ and other supportive messages to the troops in the Gulf. Fans
at the football games chanted ‘‘U.S.A., U.S.A.’’ after the National
Anthem was played.

We cannot devote our attention to the situation in the Gulf all the time.
We need a break at times, and the sports world provides an outlet from
the tense situation in the Persian Gulf. It is obvious that people have not
forgotten what is going on in the Persian Gulf and the games can still
go on.

W&LIFE

Two guitars, two voices, nomads,

indians and saints: Indigo is back

By Andrew Kelller
Staff Reporter

 

As artistry and integrity are in-
creasingly sacrificed to the gods of
technology and _ entertainment,
musicians that actually play instru-
ments and sing their own songs are
becoming a rarity.

However, some stand tall against
the temptations of ignoble fame and
put out honest work. One such group
is the Indigo Girls, yes the same
group that lost a grammy to the
multi-talented Milli Vanilli.

As simple as it sounds, the Indigo
Girls are two voices and two guitars.
While the lack of variety in in-
strumentation leads to songs that
sound similar, each listening heighte-
ns one’s sense of discrimination and
catalyzes deeper appreciation for
their work.

On their most recent album
nomads * indians * saints, the girls
used a number of guest musicians in
an attempt to spice up their one
dimensional sound: Kenny Aronoff
(John Cougar/Drums), the Ellen
James Society, Sara Lee (Bass), a
sting quartet, and Peter Buck
(REM/Dulcimer). While _ this may
seem like a lot of added instruments,
the heart of their songs always com-
es back to their strumming, picking,
and harmonizing. In reality, the guest
musicians seem to add more in terms
of community spirit then in complex
orchestration. Simply put, the Indigo
Girls just like to have friends play
on their album, and this gives the
record a natural quality that com-
puter and synthesizer-ridden record-
ing don’t have.

Only one song, 7] 2 3, suffers
from excess. This song is quite bad
and doesn’t deserve a place in this
otherwise strong work. This black
spot is easily attributed to A. Ray
who is responsible for most of this
album’s faults. While their first LP
Indigo Girls presented a duet with
each member sharing an equal bur-
den of talent, E. Saliers clearly car-
ries the load on this one. While
every one of Saliers five contribu-
tions to this album are incredibly
good, only two of Ray’s six can
compare to her partners in terms of
lyrics, chords, melody and harmony.

Keeper of My Heart is Ray’s re-
hashing of her own gem Blood and
Fire from their first Lp. Pushing the
Needle too Far has Ray making a
statement on drugs that is so self-
serving lyrically that one can’t bear
to wait through the verses to get to
the few redeeming lines of harmony.

The two Ray contributions of
value are Welcome Me and World
Falls. Of course Welcome Me

Ray’s developing talent, simply be-
cause it has been around since at
least the last album which it most
likely didn’t make. It can be seen
performed live on their videotape,
Indigo Girls Live at the Uptown
Lounge, recorded during the tour in
support of their last release. It seems
World Falls is her best offering. The
lyrics are strong with allusions toward
Wordsworth’s Intimations of Immor-
tality, and the music is equally good.
It is by far one of the album's best.

Saliers, on the other hand, has cle-
arly come into her own with a super-
ior knack for clever, meaningful
lyrics, catchy original chord changes,
and beautiful melodies and harmonies.

The album's opener, Hammer and
a Nail, combines inspiring lyrics with
motivating music. One line reads,
‘‘Now I know a refuge never grows/
From a chin in a hand in a thought-
ful pose/ Gotta tend the earth if you
want a rose,’’ Imagery in these lines
invokes the reaction that the song
encourages, which is a call for people
to make their dreams and visions
come true, rather than to sit on their
butt.

Southland in the Springtime is a
bit of nostalgia which bears a certain’
country flavoring. Once again Saliers’
lyrical imagery makes a good song
great. It is ironic that Saliers wrote
this beautiful song about the South,
for in it she admits she’s originally
from the other half of America.
**When God made me born a yankee/
He was teasin.’’ Of course, she does
mention Texas favorably in the song
and I think we all know it’s better to
be a yankee than a Texan.

Watershed is the album’s best
song, and it was undoubtedly written
by Saliers. Its verses alternate ma-
turely between single note melody
and two voice harmony for a nice
effect. Its carpe diem theme is a ac-
cented by the drums that come in
with the chorus to accompany the
soaring harmonies.

As the lyrics are initially somber
admitting to man’s inability to ever
fly as the crow flies, they reflect the
call to action theme from Hammer
and a Nail that encourages us to do
something with our life, ‘‘When
you’re learning to face the path at
your pace every choice is worth your
while.’’ The music's dynamics serve
as a musical interpretation to the
lyrics they accompany and the life
they describe.

You and Me of the 10,000 Wars is
another Saliers contribution. It ties
with Southland in the Springtime as
the album’s prettiest song. It show-
cases Saliers whispery feminine voice
as she takes the listener on a psy-
chological journey through her own,

shouldn’t really count as a sign of and probably the listener’s mind. Its
