Panhel bids
Pi Beta Phi

Atkins: despite DG failure,
W&L needs fourth sorority

 

By Pamela Kelley
Staff Reporter

Less than two months after Delta Gamma sorority’s
second failure to colonize at Washington and Lee,
Panhellenic Council members say they hope to invite Pi
Beta Phi sorority to establish a colony here.

Panhellenic Publicity and Extension Chairman Sonja
Tillberg said the possibility of inviting another chapter to
replace Delta Gamma has existed since DG national
members decided not to colonize here after a disap-
pointing Rush in January. Tillberg said moves to invite
another sorority to establish here had been delayed until
a formal study explaining DG’s failure could be com-
pleted.

Tillberg discussed the reasons behind the failed
colonization attempt with DG representatives and sur-
veyed women who participated in the Rush last month.
Although she did not disclose her findings, she said ‘‘I
think everyone realizes the need for another sorority here.
We need to do something about chapter size at this point.
It’s a question of numbers, period.”

Associate Dean of Students for Greek Affairs Leroy
‘‘Buddy”’ Atkins said sororities currently have about 130
members, with ideal chapter sizes set at 70 members.
According to Atkins, the establishment of another W&L
sorority would alleviate, but not solve the problem of
chapter size.

‘To solve the problem would mean two or three
more sororities,’’ Atkins said.

He said one sorority must first have a successful
colonization before others may be brought on, however.

‘The only thing that concerns me is the timing, we
really need to be sure the sorority succeeds the next time
we do this,’’ he said.

Atkins also mentioned that Pi Beta Phi representatives
might have reservations about coming onto campus after
DG’s recent failure to become established here. He added
however, he has received two letters from other sororities
interested in colonizing here.

Pi Beta Phi has made two presentations to the cam-
pus in the past two years in hopes of colonizing at
W&L. It was considered for one of the first three
sorority colonizations in 1989. Last year, Delta Gamma
was chosen over Pi Beta Phi to become the fourth W&L
sorority, although Pi Beta Phi was promised it would
receive the next colonization invitation.

Before Pi Beta Phi can be asked to colonize at W&L,
the Panhellenic Council must receive approval from the
Student Activities Committee to invite them. Atkins also
said national members of the W&L sororities should be
notified before Pi Beta Phi is invited to colonize here. He
said the whole process should take a week.

Law recruitment policy
angers military veteran

 

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

 

A Law School faculty policy
prohibiting the military from recruit-
ing on the law campus could inhibit
fund raising for Mock Convention
and Washington and Lee.

John S. Mason, W&L ’69 and
U.S. Navy veteran, in a letter to the
Mock Convention Steering Committee
that was passed to the Executive
Committee, said that for him to
donate money after the Law School
policy change would be
‘inappropriate,"’ as part of his in-
come is derived from the military.

Executive Director of Develop-
ment Lex McMillan said his office
has not received Mason’s letter, but
at least two other alumni ‘‘have
expressed concern and dismay’’ at the
policy, he said.

After meeting with University
President John Wilson on Wednesday,
EC President Tom Hatcher said that
Wilson and Law School Dean Ran-
dall Bezanson are preparing a letter
of protest to the Association of
American Law Schools, an agency
with which W&L is accredited

The AALS mandated last August
that its member schools pass a policy
which, among other requirements,
prohibits employers that lawfully
discriminate against homosexuals
from using campus placement facili-
ties.

The law faculty amended its poli-
cy Feb. 11 to conform with the
AALS mandate, thus excluding the
military from recruiting at W&L.

After a student outcry and peti-
tion by more than 225 law students,
the faculty reconsidered its decision
on March 4, but took no action.

‘*There’s the real potential for a
financial backlash’ to the policy in
alumni contributions, Hatcher said.

Mason said his donations to the
school are small and irregular, but
that he took a stand on principle.

‘‘Many of my fellow alumni have
served with distinction in the military
and have valued the experience,’’ said
Mason’s letter. ‘‘It is unfortunate
that the university seeks to deny [that
to] future graduates.’’

McMillan said there is no way to
measure the policy’s economic effect
on the university.

He said that a phone campaign to
solicit contributions to the Annual
Fund in Houston this week has gone
“very well,’’ and he has not heard
of the policy affecting activity there.

Mock Convention Treasurer John
Darden said Monday Mason’s letter
was the only such letter he has
received. He said Mason was con-
tacted as part of a fundraising effort
to reach alumni who gave al least
$100 to the last Mock Convention.

Bezanson, though he would not
comment on Mason’s letter, said one
issue the law faculty considered in its
original debate was W&L’s AALS
accreditation.

Bezanson said he does not know
if non-compliance with AALS policy
would cost accreditation, but he said
such a loss ‘‘would be a substantial
matter.”

Hatcher said the Wilson-Bezanson
letter, though not yet final, will prob-
ably point out that the policy has
caused divisiveness at other Virginia
law schools as well as W&L.

An AALS policy at the Univer-
sity of Virginia law school was sus-
pended by the UVa. president ‘*pend-
ing reexamination,’’ according to
UVa. Law Prof. George Rutherglen.

The president of the Executive Committee told
city officials last week that as hard as the city tries
to collect the car tax, W&L students will try
harder not to pay it.

EC President Tom Hatcher Thursday told
members of the Lexington City Council that the
city and students will ‘‘continue to butt heads’’ on
the tax issue because the two groups ‘‘cannot agree
on a compromise.”’

Briefing the council on meetings between
student representatives and selected city officials,
Hatcher said students are not willing to give up
federal privacy rights by letting the university turn
over a list of student cars registered with W&L.
Members of the city government had offered to let
students pay only three-fourths of the annual tax
rate since they are here only nine months out of
the year if the list was provided.

Hatcher also said he did not understand why
the city would not accept the student proposal of
a ‘‘parking fee’’ paid by students with cars. He

said any student payment to the city should be
based on how much parking space student vehicles
take up, ‘‘not on what kind of car | drive.”’

Hatcher told the council there are two
differences of opinion at the heart of the
disagreement:

First, the city views students as Lexington
citizens while students consider themselves
‘‘extended visitors.’’ Hatcher said the result is that
the city is taxing non-wage earners oF students’
parents.

He also said the city considers the tax dispute
a legal question while students feel they ‘‘already
make a significant contribution’ to the local
economy.

“But since the city thinks it is a legal
question,’’ said Hatcher, ‘students are going to use
every legal means available not to pay ie

Hatcher said such methods could include
switching cars during the year or parking them
outside the city limits so that they are not garaged
in the city for more than six months. Virginia state
law says that a car must be ‘‘principally
domiciled’ within a municipality for the majority
of the year in order for the municipality to collect

personal property tax on it.

Hatcher told the council students would be
under the Honor System if they signed a city
exemption form saying their car is not within
Lexington for more than six months.

In response to a question from councilman
Sidney Brown, Hatcher said it would be the city’s
legal responsibility to prove that a student was
lying when they signed the exemption. But he
urged city officials to report any such case to the
EC.

After Hatcher repeatedly mentioned the
university’s $45,000 annual donation to the city,
councilman Timothy Golden asked how that gift
could be construed as coming from students.
Hatcher said the university is the student’s
representative to the city and that the contribution
comes out of student tuition.

Golden responded by asking if the donation
would increase when tuition goes up.

Councilwoman Louise Moore asked Hatcher
why he thought the tax was unfair to students and
not to residents. Hatcher told her that even if
students paid the tax here, they would still be
paying tax at home.

Student’s lost card

When senior Mellissa Weller
misplaced her University Card last
January, she thought little of it.

“T must have left it in the C-
School copier,’’ said Weller. ‘‘I never
thought it was gone. I didn’t even
realize it was missing until several
days later.”’

Weller retrieved the card from the
Commerce School secretary after
someone had tured it in, Case
closed. After all, this is Washington
and Lee.

But when Weller received her
monthly statement during February
Break, it listed a $138 bookstore
charge that Weller was sure she had
not made,

“I purchased all of my books
long before the posted date of Janu-
ary 30,” she said.

When Weller brought this com-
plaint to the Business Office, they
verified that a $138 bookstore charge
had been made on Monday, Jan. 28

hard way

at 12:01 p.m. The records also
showed that the card itself had been
used, not just Weller’s ID number,
said Assistant University Treasurer
John Cuny.

That corresponded to a time when
the card was missing and Weller was
in class.

“When I got a call from the
Business Office saying that we had to
eat about $138, I didn’t really fight
it,”’ said Bookstore Manager Tidge
Roller. ‘‘It is our responsibility to
look at the card.”’

This is the first such problem
with the University Card since the
new system went into effect last
December.

‘‘The card is much better than
before, but there will be problems,”’
said Cuny. ‘‘The important thing is
that we correct them.”

Cuny urges anyone misplacing
their card to report it immediately to
the Business Office. The card is more
than just a point card. It is a copier
card, a bookstore charge card, and
soon a general debit and soda
machine card.

Dress,’’ said Beard. ‘‘This year was
one of the best, if not the best in my
21 years as an officer.’’

Police reported no major offenses
or injuries. ‘I’m real pleased. I’m
tickled pink,’’ said Beard.

According to Beard, Lexington
police this week issued 34 citations
for underage alcohol possession, four
charges of drinking in public, three
citations of drunk in public, and one
noise violation. There were no re-
ported conflicts between students and
local residents and no student arrests
for driving under the influence of
alcohol.

‘“The student body as a whole has
become more aware of the problems
caused by alcohol abuse,” said
Beard.

Beard credits the formation of a
police-student relationship committee
for much of this success. At commit-
tee meetings, department officials
discuss problems with fraternity rep-
resentatives.

Beard believes this communication
has relieved much of the tension
between students and police. He
called Dean of Students David Howi-
son to express his gratitude for the
exceptional student conduct.

‘I'd like to express my apprecia
tion for the cooperation of the student
body for contributing to the success
of the Fancy Dress weekend,’’ he
said.
 

 

 

 

 

 

OPINION

 

SCC on the line

By now, most of us have recovered from Fancy Dress
weekend, just in time for some of us to initiate the pledges
and all of us to make the final push toward finals. Yes,
these are exciting times. But before we dedicate every
surviving brain cell to various end-of-the term activities, we
need to remember a very important and immediate, yet too-
often neglected, responsibility: class elections.

This week, we’ll decide which of our peers will represent
us for the next year as our class officers. Many of us take
this responsibility much too lightly. Contrary to conventional
thought, our main concern when voting should not center
around who will throw the best class party. We should
primarially be concerned with who will will make the best
judgements on the Student Conduct Committee.

Few of us can claim that we never lapse into a
temporarily fit of mischief. This mischief can take many
forms, and occasionally, it poses a serious enough threat to
the well-being of the student body to deserve a meeting with
the SCC for possible disciplinary action. We should do
everything in our power to ensure that the SCC is made up
of representatives who understand the importance of their
position and are willing to make judgements with the utmost
care and thoughtfulness.

Some students might have such confidence in their ability
to stay out of trouble or for other reasons see no personal
consequence of ignoring the SCC that they trivialize the
election of class representatives. A quick reminder of the
threat to student government posed by the three students
who were suspended for breaking windows in the newly-
renovated SAE house should serve to dispel this false
justification for apathy. President Wilson took such drastic
measures because he had lost confidence in the student
government’s ability to discipline the students appropriately.
We need to re-establish the confidence in student
government that has been lost. We can do that by electing
students who are capable and willing to make the changes
needed to get the SCC back on its feet.

Whether President Wilson was justified in his actions is
open to debate, but the perceived lack of effectiveness on
the part of the SCC is real. If we want student autonomy to
remain a strong traditon at W&L, we need to take it more
seriously.

More Greeks

With Washington and Lee’s three sororities bursting at
the seams, the Panhellenic Council has decided to bring a
fourth sorority to campus. The necessity of that decision is
a rather obvious. A more difficult task will be determining
the colonization procedure. Over the past year, it has
become obvious, and painfully so to the women who
pledged Delta Gamma, that following the colonization
instructions of nationals will not work at W&L. Panhel is
indeed facing its first big challenge: how to overcome DG’s
problems and make possible the successful colonization of
a new sorority.

For The Ring-tum Phi, the more immediate problem with
the Pi Beta Phi sorority coming to W&L is one of
semantics. On every other campus in the world, Pi Beta Phi
is called Pi Phi. But that won’t work here; we’ve already
got a Pi Phi thanks to Pi Kappa Phi. Of course, on the same
campuses, Pi Kappa Phi is called Pi Kap. But what about
Phi Kap? Pi Phi, Pi Kap, Phi Kap. Hate to be a freshmen
again.

MY VIEW
By Lynne Cheney

AW AM

 

 

So much of what has happened in
the world during the past few years
has demonstrated the long-term
wisdom of being what is called
‘‘politically incorrect.’’ One of the
tenets of that position, I think most
people would agree, is an affirmation
of the importance of Westem
civilization.

Now, of course, the history of the
West is not a narrative of unbroken
progress. We have monumental
failures to our credit; and, indeed,
bringing those failures to light,
holding them up and looking at them
this way and that, is one of our finest
traditions.

The West is not perfect, but we
do have on our record some glorious
accomplishments. In 1989, before
Tiananamen Square, Fang Lizhi,
scientist and dissident, spoke of the
aims of China’ democracy movement.
‘‘What we are calling for is
extremely basic,’’ he said, ‘‘namely,
freedom of speech, press, assembly
and travel. Concepts of human rights
and democracy,’ he went on,
‘‘although the founding principles of
the U.S. government, should not be
viewed as something exclusively
Western. Actually, they are a legacy
to the world.”’

These ideas are no small gift to
have brought to humankind. They are
gifts of such worth that people go
into exile and prison for them. They
are gifts of such great worth that
people die for them, as they did less
than two years ago in Tiananamen
Square, as they did last month in
Vilnius and Riga.

But concepts of human rights and
democracy, though they embody
longings buried deep in every soul,
can be suppressed. As Charles
Krauthammer has observed, the will
to freedom is a constant of human
nature, but so is the will to power.

scholarship

Tyrants have risen up before and they
will again, ruthless despots bent on
substituting their ambitions for the
rule of law. Today brave Americans
in the Persian Gulf, joined by
courageous men and women from
more than two dozen nations, are
engaged in battle with such a despot,
demonstrating to history and the
world that while freedom may not be
inevitable, free societies can organize
themselves to tum back tyranny.

We live in remarkable times,
times that, our grandchildren and
great-grandchildren will ask us about.
Surely they will want to know about
Eastern Europe, about the men and
women who gathered by the hundreds
of thousands in the Lenin Shipyard in
Gdansk, at the Berlin Wall, in
Wenceslas Square; and when we
explain what motivated these people
to come together and defy
dictatorship, we shall have to speak
not only of the horrors of communist
oppression, but also of the promise
offered by freedom, of the alternative
vision offered by countries where
elections and economies are free.

Our grandchildren will ask us
about the Soviet Union, too, and who
can say how the story we tell them
will end? I was in the Soviet Union
three months ago, and it was a place
amazingly changed from the last time
I had been there, seven years before.
St. Basil’s, the onion-domed cathedral
on Red Square, has been consecrated.
Danilov Monastery, in ruins when I
visited before, has been restored.
Masses were being held there every
Sunday — and Saturdays as well.

Another striking change is that it
is now possible to have frank
conversations with Soviet citizens.
When I visited Leningrad and
Moscow several years ago, I seldom
had the sense that anyone was
speaking candidly. But now Soviets
young and old, are willing to talk
about the challenges they face. For
scholars in the Soviet Union the
biggest challenge is depoliticizing -
- or de-ideologizing as they often

say — both the teaching and learning
of history.

Perhaps the most reticent scholarly
group with which I met, at least
initially, were historians at the
Military History Institute in Moscow.
You have to understand that I bring
a little baggage with me to a meeting
like that. No one is unaware of my
spouse’s occupation. So there was
some reticence. And when the subject
of depoliticizing the study of history

came up, the first statement was very...

cautious.

Shouldn’t the goal of
scholars everywhere
be to make art and
inquiry as free as
possible of political
bias and influence?

“We can never completely
remove politics from the study of
history,’’ one colonel said, ‘‘because
we cannot remove ourselves from
politics."’ ‘‘True enough,’’ I agreed,
‘‘but shouldn’t we try to minimize
the effect of politics on our
scholarship?’ There were some
careful nods around the table. ‘‘If we
don’t work to minimize it,’’ I asked,
‘‘don’t we become horses wearing
blinders?”’

This was not a_ particularly
imaginative metaphor, but it had
astonishing cross-cultural resonance. It
changed the tone of the meeting.
Hardly was it translated when it
elicited the most positive response,
not just careful nods, but enthusiastic
stories about projects it was now
possible to pursue before.

One colonel — one scholar, I
should say — was working on the
question of how many people were
killed in the Bolshevik Revolution -
- hardly a politically correct problem
to pursue. Another scholar, the head
of the Institute, is writing a biography
of Trotsky and using Trotsky’s papers
to do so — a project that would have

been unheard of a few years ago.

There is no neat conclusion to
this story, no nice happy ending. In
fact, one has to wonder, to worry
about the course of events in the
Soviet Union. How long can the
effort to de-ideologize scholarship
continue when President Gorbachev is
seeking to limit freedom of the press?
Sull, what I observed in the Soviet
Union does prompt some important
questions.

Shouldn’t the» goal of scholars
everywhere be. to make art and
inquiry as free as possible of political
bias and influence? Of course, we are
political creatures, but understanding

 

that, shouldn’t we try to raise
ourselves up and acquire a broader
perspective?

If we insist that all literature, all
art, be run through any single
political prism, whether it be Marxist
or capitalist or feminist or European
or Third World, aren’t ‘ve creatures
of diminished vision?

Indeed, if we. insist, as has
become fashionable in some quarters,
that culture and all its creations are
everywhere congruent with political
struggle, isn’t that the most
diminished and diminishing
perspective of all?

There was an inescapable irony
about being in the Soviet Union and
hearing again and again about the
importance of depoliticizing and de-
ideologizing the study of culture
when so often in the United States I
read or hear about the importance of
using the arts and the humanities as
instruments of politics.

I understand that the people
advocating this view believe fervently
that the political agendas they want to
advance are good ones; but, however
well-intentioned, using the arts and
the humanities in this way limits
vision. It is putting on blinders, and
what a tragedy for us to do that as
intellectuals in other parts of the
world are struggling to take them off.

Look to preserve
student autonomy

 

concern about a troubling issue regarding the law
school, word of which has come from Lexington
by way of the Richmond newspapers. However,
should you deem this acceptable to publish, I
would be most pleased.

The issue to which I refer is the absurd
decision on the part of the law school faculty to
ban military recruitment from the law campus, on
the basis that the armed services discriminate
against homosexuals.

Although this policy of the military was
upheld in 1990 by the U.S. Supreme Court, the
would-be justices on the banks of Woods Creek
have decided that the highest court is in error,
and that by showing its moral indignation against
the military, and in support of sodomites, the law
school will somehow be a better place; and that
the law students, so vulnerable to the
representatives of the armed forces of the U.S.,
will be safer.

The faculty vote indicates that opinions,

decisions. The ‘‘debate,’’ if there was one, has
been stifled; the discussion has been smothered.
This, all in the name of being politically correct.

Where, if not in the halls of the academy, can
discussion and the free flow of ideas take place?
Not at Lewis Hall, we now can see, What we do
see is a group of '60s radicals, now tenured,
resentful that their former dogmas have been
proven to be bust, and that by striking out
against the military, they can recapture some lost
momentum from better times.

It is amazing that this decision comes on the
heels of our country;s success in freeing Kuwait
and standing firm in the face of Iraq;s violation
of morality and international law. I always
thought it appropriate while at W&L that the law
school was somewhat separated from the rest of
campus by Woods Creek; the recent ban on
military recruitment there shows just how
separated the law professors are from real life.

This semester some controversial decisions
have brought into question the validity of our
claim to student autonomy here at W&L. Rather
than point fingers and deflect responsibility to
others, we, as the beneficiaries of  self-
governance, must look at our options for
eliminating similar controversies in the future,

Obviously, Monday’s elections are the best
starting point. Simplistically stated, the election
of a class officer can be a popularity contest, or
it can be a decision based on the candidate’s
ability to fairly adjudicate violations of trust or
misconduct.

The choice is ours, unless we believe in the
benefits of student autonomy at Washington and
Lee. In that case, the choice has already been
made for us.

Sincerely,
Tom Hatcher
President of the Executive Committee

Judge sends VMI case to trial

¢

 

By Joshua Manning
’ Staff Reporter
i

A federal judge refused to issue a

"summary judgement against Virginia
; Military Institute last week in the

case regarding its male-only admis-
‘sions policy.

The case, filed by the United
States Department of Justice last
‘year, claims that the policy violates

the 14th Amendment and the Civil
‘Rights Act of 1964.

; The Justice Department attorneys
had asked U.S. District Judge Jack-
‘son Kiser to forego a trial by issuing
, the summary judgement.

Kiser declined, saying the govern-

‘ment attorneys might be wrong in
, their legal assumption that education-
al diversity ‘‘can never justify a

¢ discriminatory policy.’’

, _Attomeys for VMI have main-
tained that the school broadens the

‘diversity of higher education in
Virginia and that admitting women
would narrow educational choice.

, The Justice Department declined
to comment on Kiser’s decision
‘except to say that they are ‘‘press-
) ing ahead with the trial.’’

_ Despite his ruling, Kiser said VMI
’ ‘still faces a high burden of proof.

 

It must provide an exceedingly per-
suasive justification of the single sex
policy.”

The VMI trial is scheduled to
begin April 4 at United States Dis-
trict Court in Roanoke.

Meanwhile, a bill that would have
forced VMI to admit women died
late last month when the Virginia
General Assembly went into recess.

Senate Bill 821 had been doomed
since it failed to reach the floor by
the Feb. 15 deadline for new bills,

The bill would have forbidden
state-supported colleges or universi-
ties to discriminate against applicants
on the basis of race, gender, or
religion.

After being introduced by Fairfax
Senator Emilie Miller last year, the

Senator Elmon Gray, chairman of

Gray, speaking for the committee,

W&L’s Outing Club is expanding
its campus recycling program, but is
+ having trouble dealing with the in-
creased workload.

The new program will place col-
! lection points for mixed and computer

paper in all buildings on campus.
! Currently, the club has collection
, points in the freshman dorms, Reid

Hall, the Commerce School, in the
! Snack Bar and between Graham-Lees
and the Bookstore.

Dean of the College John Elrod,

, In

who requested and later approved the
new program, said, ‘‘I thought there
was a real need to recycle the waste
paper this campus produces and I
think the Outing Club has developed
an excellent plan for doing so.’’

According to senior club member
Gray Rand, collection bins have
already been placed in Washington
Hall and the-efforts there have been
succesful so far.

‘*We’re ready to expand to a few
other buildings on the Colonnade in
the next few weeks,’’ said Rand.

Elrod said the program will be
implemented ‘‘piece by piece’’ until
the funds can be found to ‘‘go ahead
full force.’’

Two years ago, the Police Depart-
ment established a committee to work
with the Interfraternity Council. The
committee of two officers and Police
Chief Bruce Beard hosts a forum for
W&L fraternity presidents and the
department to discuss problems with
fraternity functions in Lexington.
Lewis is the first IFC president to be
honored by the department. ~

According to Sutton, Lewis’ IFC
administration has kept drunk driving
under control by encouraging frater-
nities to use Live Drive and desig-
nated sober drivers.

Sutton said Fancy Dress weekend
was relatively quiet due to Lewis’
efforts to educate fraternities about
police policies and plans for the
traditionally wild weekend.

‘‘He’s probably the best we’ve
said Sutton. ‘‘It’s
recognition ‘for a job well done.”’

recycling

Rand said however that the Out-
ing Club is already having difficulty
coping with the increased load.

‘It takes two to three people four
hours a week to collect the stuff and
take it to the recycling center,’’ he
said. ‘‘Most of us just don’t have the
time to do that more than once a
term.”’

Rand said the club would like to
buy a truck and hire some work-
study students to help with the proj-
ect.

‘‘We think recycling is extremely
inportant and we’re doing the best we
can with what we've got,’’ said
Rand. ‘‘When we have more, we'll
do even better.’’

“Our policy is the same as the
Health and Education Committee,’’
said Joynes. ‘‘We will not comment
on any aspect of the Justice Depart-
ment’s litigation.”’

Journalism ethics
topic of seminar

 

By Craig Burke
Staff Reporter

 

Robert P. Clark, newspaperman
and former vice president of news for
Harte-Hanks Newspapers, will speak
Friday at Washington and Lee’s 17th
Journalism Ethics Institute.

Clark's public lecture, ‘‘The Foun-
ding Fathers and the Bottom Line,’’
will be held at 8 p.m. in the Univer-
sity Library’s Northen Auditorium.

Professor of Journalism Ronald
MacDonald said Clark has visited
W&L before, and the journalism
professors felt he would be an excel-
lent keynote speaker.

“Somebody in the Joumalism
Department heard Clark speak and
thought his theme was intriguing,”
MacDonald said.

Clark’s career in journalism began
after he graduated from Tufts Uni-
versity and earned a master’s degree
in journalism from the University of
Missouri.

System allows
self-diagnosis;
speeds recovery

TTT aA TR Ate A WROD maT a cion
By Jennifer Mayo
Staff Reporter

Students suffering from colds no
longer have to wait for an appoint-
ment with the doctor to receive over-
the-counter medications from the
Student Health Center.

A new ‘‘cold center’? allows
student self-diagnosis of minor ill-
nesses and advises the patient of
either medication or necessary ap-
pointments with a physician.

When a student visits the cold
center, he fills out a cold symptoms
checklist, choosing his symptoms
from a list of possible ones including
chills, headache, sneezing, sore throat,
cough and others.

The next step is a throat self-
exam to determine if the throat is red
or has white patches. Finally, he
takes and records his temperature.

After examining each of these
factors, the student consults a bulletin
board in the room to choose the best
self-care measures. This board might
recommend over-the-counter medica-
tions such as acetaminophen, cough
syrup, decongestant or throat loz-
enges. It also might refer the patient
to a doctor for a more thorough
checkup.

The nurse on duty will give out
the proper medications and schedule
the necessary appointments.

“This should cut down on the
waiting period for students with sim-
ple colds,’’ said W&L Health Edu-
cator Jan Kaufman. ‘‘Especially for
those who get sick over the weekend.
It should also make the doctors’ jobs
a little easier.’’

Although the cold center missed
the annual cold and flu season this
year, students can anticipate easier
and quicker relief from colds to
come.

The Washington and Lee men’s
lacrosse team was ranked 13th in the
first NCAA Division III poll, but the
Generals are proving that people may
have underestimated their talent.

‘We're a pretty decent team,”’
said head coach Jim Stagnitta after
W&L’s 10-6 win over 9th ranked
Roanoke College Wednesday. ‘‘We’re
not an overpowering team by any
means, but we play hard and we’re
getting better every game.’’

 

 

 

 

 

Mike Moseman

W&L’s win was its second
straight over teams ranked in the
Division III top 10. On Saturday,
W&L topped 7th-ranked Franklin and
Marshall 7-5.

“IT thought before the season
started that we're one of the best
eight teams in the nation,’’ said sen-
ior goalie Tom Costello. ‘‘The two
wins really set us up for the ODAC
title and the NCAA tournament. The
wins take a lot of pressure off of us
because the second half of our sched-
ule is not as tough as the first half.”’

Costello may sound cocky, but he
and his teammates are making a
strong case to be included in the
nation’s top eight.

 

   

 

 

Tom Costello

 

In winning the two games, W&L
allowed just 11 goals, two of which
were scored in the final minute of
each game, after both games were
decided.

Against F&M, the offensive attack
was led by senior Mike Moseman,
who had two goals and an assist.
Sophomore Jeff Roberts added two
goals and sophomore Jay West added
a key goal late in the game.

Against Roanoke, W&L got off to
an early 3-0 lead on a goal from
sophomore Derek Hutton and two
from Roberts. Roanoke tied the game
early in the third quarter at 5-5 be-
fore W&L took charge.

Moseman scored twice, and sen-
iors Clark Wight and Todd Garliss
and junior Drew Anton also scored in
a 17-minute stretch that gave W&L
its first regular season win over Roa-
noke since 1984. Roberts, Wight,
Garliss and Moseman each had two
goals to lead W&L’s balanced attack.
Wight and Anton added two assists
each,

 

We’re a pretty good
team. We’re not an
overpowering team
by any means, but
we play hard and
we’re getting better
every game.

— Jim Stagnitta

 

Stagnitta said Moseman’s play has
improved over the season.

‘No one has noticed his play,’’
said Stagnitta. ‘‘He knows when to
settle the offense down. He plays
hard every minute and he is making
excellent decisions. He is also shoot-
ing the ball well.’’

Costello and the defense have
been hot. Costello made 27 saves in
the two games, including six in the
third quarter against F&M and seven

in the fourth quarter against Roankoe.

“Our defense has been in-
credible,’ said Stagnitta. ‘‘[Soph-
omore Josh] Levinson has been un-
believable. [Senior David] Farace has
worked hard and improved his one-
on-one defense, and [junior Robert]
Huke has the talent to be one of the
best defenders in the nation.”’

Junior defenseman Robert Huke shuts down a Franklin & Marshall
player Saturday on Wilson Field. Huke and the defense stood tall,

Stagnitta was especially pleased
with the defense against Roanoke.

‘“‘Our defensemen, including the
middies [Hutton, junior Jeff O’Brien
and seniors Andy Guida and Mike
Pardo] aren’t letting people get by
them. Huke is shutting down their
best attackman and Farace is getting
ground balls. They were just solid.’’

And that has made things easier
on Costello, who says he is seeing
the ball better now than he has be-
fore.

‘*T’ve seen the ball well in the last
few games,”’ he said. ‘‘I don’t think
there is something I can point to as
why, but I am.’’

doing may be a reason.

“The defense is pushing people
out from in front of the goal,’’ said
Costello. ‘‘They are making people
feed the goal from way out, and that
makes my job easier.’’

While the defense has played well,
Stagnitta said the offense could shoot
better,

“We still aren’t shooting the ball
very well,’’ he said. ‘‘We could also
be more patient offensively.’’

W&L looks for ODAC

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

The Washington and Lee basevall
team had its four-game winning
streak snapped Monday in a 19-8 loss
to Bridgewater, but despite the loss,
the team still holds high expectations
for itself.

“I was a little disappointed that
we lost,’’ said senior catcher Chris

_ Kavanagh. ‘‘It’s easy to look at that
* game from last year’s point of view

and say, ‘we improved.’ But if we
look at it from this year’s point of
view, we should have won_ the
game.’’

Kavanagh is pointing to W&L’s

' 4-0 start before running into Bridge-

~

water. It is W&L’s best start since
1974,

After sweeping West Virginia
Tech to open the season, W&L upset
Division I Holy Cross 9-6 behind

‘ solid hitting and the ever-steady
' pitching of junior Steve Momorella.

Freshman Eric Peifer got W&L
going offensively with a home run in
the third inning, and the Generals

' built a 4-0 lead.

Momorella, who cruised through
the first five innings, ran into trouble

‘in the sixth, when he lost control of
, his curve ball. He was touched for

six runs on four hits and two walks

‘as 10 men came to the plate. Despite

       

struggling, Momorella wasn’t sur-
prised that head coach Jeff Stickley
left him in the game.

‘“‘We know each other pretty
well,’’ said Momorella, who threw
over 140 pitches on the day. ‘‘I think
he knew that if he let me stay out
there, I could work things out.’’

While Momorella worked things
out on the mound, his teammates
worked things out at the plate. W&L
scored three times in the bottom of
the sixth to take the lead as Peifer
and junior Kavanagh drove in runs.

After Momorella settled down,
W&L got him some insurance in the
bottom of the seventh. Kavanagh
gave W&L the 9-6 margin of victory
with a towering two-run home run to
right field.

W&L’s hitting continued through
the weekend as the Generals put eight
runs on the board against Bridge-
water, who is considered the class of
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference.

Junior T.J. Daly homered to key
W&L’s six-run fourth inning as the
Generals took a 7-5 lead. The Gen-
erals sent 11 batters to the plate in
the inning. After BC took a one-run
lead in the top of the fifth, senior
Tim Wheeler tied the game again
with a leadoff home run.

After the fifth, though, it was all
Eagles. BC sent 13 men to the plate

 

 

 

while scoring eight runs in the sev-
enth inning to put the game away,
19-8,

Junior Brian Harper led the W&L
attack. Harper was 2-for-5 at the
plate with two doubles, a run scored
and five RBI.

Despite the loss, W&L continues
to produce at the plate, something it
didn’t do last season.

“We're hitting pretty well,’’ said
Kavanagh. ‘‘I don’t think there is
anything you can point to as a reason
for the improvement, we’re just hitt-
ing. We’re a pretty good hitting
team.”’

Possibly the most appreciative
recipient of the hitting is Momorella,
who lost five games last year by two
runs or less.

‘‘We’re practicing more and we’re
hitting better,’ he said. ‘‘Good hitt-
ing is contagious. If a few guys start
to hit well, then everyone will hit
well,’’

With the improved hitting, Kav-
anagh sees no reason why W&L
can’t compete for an ODAC title.

“Once we beat Holy Cross, it
sunk in that we were a good team,”’
he said. ‘‘We’re capable of beating
every team in this league, and if the
pitching is there, I see no reason why
we can’t win the league.’’

To win the league, W&L will
need to get a lot of quality innings

..key home run on Thursday
from Momorella, who has thrown
complete games in his first two starts.
Momorella says he will be ready to

pitch come tournament time.

‘‘T like to throw a lot early in the
season,’’ he said. ‘‘It helps build up
my arm strength. Towards the end of
the season, though, if I’ve thrown a
lot, I'll probably take a week off to
rest for the ODAC tournament.’’

But for now, it’s back to the
mound for Momorella. He will start
today in an ODAC game against

Sting’s Soul Cages
lacks energy, soul

 

By Carli Flippen
Staff Reporter

After a three year hiatus, Sting
has released his third solo record,
Soul Cages.

My first reaction to this album
was that I miss Sting’s old band, The
Police. | miss their exciting, up-beat
pop tunes, with their unique blend of
reggae and punk elements. Their
songs like “‘Roxanne,”’ ‘‘Message in
a Bottle,” and ‘Every Breath You
Take,’’ are still popular and regu-
larly by bands at parties.

Sting’s first three solo albums
contained a similar excitement and
energy. He assembled a band of the
top young jazz musicians and re-
leased rhythmically and harmonically
unique tunes, which are danceable
and catchy and have a lot of energy.

However, Sting seems to have lost
the enthusiasm he once had for
making pop music in the three years
he has taken off from recording.
Although the music on this album is
carefully constructed and beautiful, it
is fairly soulless.

Only on the single release “All
This Time" and "Jeremiah Blues (Part
I)" does his band ever really kick
into action and sound as though they
are enjoying playing. The rest of the
album relies on swirling chords,

European folk sounds, and imagina-
live instrumentation such as oboes
and Northumbian Pipes to create the
music.

I don’t mean to say that the
music is bad. It’s beautiful. Most of
it is very similar to his earlier songs
"Russians" and "They Dance Alone."
They are mid-tempo songs that base
their instrumentation on echoing
percussion, keyboards and bass, a4-
ding other instruments for effect.

Most of the songs on Soul Cages
have a_ slow, swirling, haunting
quality. There is even a duet for
guitar and mandolin that sounds very
much like a Russian or Slavic folk
tune, and sounds as if it were lifted
from a Windham Hill sampler.

The lyrics are very introspective
and complex. Many of the songs,
such as “Island of Souls," deal with
Sting’s relationship with his recently
deceased father, who worked in a
shipyard and there is a great deal of
nautical imagery in the songs.

The album Soul Cages, as a
whole, is very beautifully done. The
lyrics are about as introspective and
deep as a commercial artist would
dare get. The songs have a haunting
quality and make effective use of
creative instrumentation. However,
the songs, with only a couple of
exceptions, lack the energy and soul-
fullness of Sting’s earlier works.

W&L Chorus notes

University groups will perform Tuesday

 

From the W&L News Office

 

Washington and Lee University’s
choral groups will present their first
concert in the new Lenfest Center for
the Performing Arts Tuesday, March
19, at 8 p.m.

The concert will feature the Men’s
Glee Club, W&L’s oldest choral
ensemble which was founded in 1898,
and the Women’s Chorus, the newest
ensemble which was formed in 1988.
Together they will present a program
of choral selections spanning four
centuries of sacred and secular litera-
ture.

The Women’s Chorus, under the
direction of Courtney Birch, will
open the concert with two folk song
settings by Vaughan Williams. These
will be followed by a selection by
Zoltan Kodaly and concluded by
Felix Mendelssohn’s setting of the
sacred text, ‘‘Laudate Pueri.’’

The Men’s Glee Club, directed by
Gordon Spice, will sing two sacred
works from the Renaissance, ‘‘Cant-
ate Domino’’ by Hans Leo Hassler,
and ‘‘Lobet den Herren’”’ by Gallus
Dressler. An arrangement of Brahms’
‘‘How lovely is thy dwelling place,’’
for male voices will follow. Two
Italian folk songs, ‘‘El Giasso’’ and
“Il Nocchierel,”’ and a_ spiritual,
‘*You’d better run.”’

In a tribute to the late American
composer Aaron Copeland, the Glee
Club will sing ‘‘The Dodger,’’ and
will then be joined by the Women’s
Chorus in performances of ‘‘Simple
Gifts’ and ‘‘At the River.’’ The
combined choruses will end the pro-
gram with the ‘‘Washington and Lee
Hymn”’ and the ‘‘W&L Swing.” The
hymn was recently composed by
Margaret Brouwer, assistant professor
of music, with words by W&L soph-
omore Scott Howe.
