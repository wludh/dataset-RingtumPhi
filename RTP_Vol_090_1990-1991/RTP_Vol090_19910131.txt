EC defeats proposed
White Book change

 

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

Debate over White Book revisions con-
tinued this week as the Executive Committee
defeated a controversial change in the Honor
System’s Philosophy section.

The White Book Revisions Committee
proposed numerous revisions Jan. 14, includ-
ing the addition of ‘‘or act dishonorably’’
to the familiar ‘‘lie, cheat, or steal’’ phrase
of the Philosophy section.

Sophomore EC Rep. Kirk Ogden mo-
tioned Monday that rather than adopt the
WBRC proposal, the EC delete the “‘lie,
cheat, or steal’’ reference.

The phrase ‘‘lying, cheating, and steal-
ing’’ would remain in the Enforcement
section.

Ogden’s proposal failed despite votes in
favor from EC President Tom Hatcher,
third-year law Rep. Mark Cobb, senior Rep.
John Fialcowitz, and Ogden. Senior Rep.
Willard Dumas and junior Rep. Caroline
Wight were absent during the vote.

The WBRC called its original proposal

“*a clarification’’
White Book.

WBRC member Bradley Turner said the
current text ‘‘leads people to the mistaken
interpretation that the Honor System means
three things.”’

The White Book currently states that
“lying, cheating and stealing are clear
examples of breaches of the Honor Sys-
tem,’’ which ‘‘applies to any conduct con-
sidered dishonorable by the student genera-
tion involved.”’

Critics of the WBRC proposal charge
that the addition could change how the
Honor System functions, possibly causing
jurisdictional conflicts between the EC and
conduct review committees.

EC Vice President Raymond Welder said
the EC might be forced to decide an honor
accusation over a ‘‘drunk in public’’ or find
itself ‘‘running around catching drug deal-
ers.’’

Cobb said, ‘‘If someone turns someone
in for doing drugs,’’ the EC should consider
the case.

Second-year law Rep. Giles Perkins said
however that ‘‘in reality’? the EC has ‘‘op-

and stealing is what we deal with.’’

An explicit expansion of honor violations
beyond the three examples would cause the
EC ‘‘to lose our potency and become the
police counsel we’re so afraid to be,’’ Per-
kins said.

Hatcher said after the vote that if the EC
wants to limit honor violations to the three
White Book ‘‘examples,’’ the committee
should consider removal of text that defines
violations more broadly.

First-year law Rep. Daniel Munroe open-
ed debate on another WBRC proposal to
change the notation from ‘‘dismissed’’ to
“‘withdrawn’’ on the transcript of a student
found guilty in open hearing.

‘‘Withdrawn’’ currently appears on the
transcript of a student found guilty in closed
hearing. Only a guilty verdict after appeal
yields the ‘‘dismissed’’ notation.

The EC tabled that issue until next
week’s meeting.

The EC will meet Monday in the Moot
Courtroom at 7 p.m. to allow the 1991-92
Big Three candidates to meet in the EC
room at 5 p.m.

 

That book, which Thompson has called his
‘‘personal favorite,’ was called by The New
York Times ‘‘the best book of the dope
decade,’’ and details the exploits of him and his
attomey”as they attempt to cover a road racé
and a national district attorneys’ convention.

Since then he has written a number of other
books, including The Great Shark Hunt (1977),
and The Curse of Lona (1981).

His latest book, Songs of the Doomed, was
published last year.

Hatcher says the fundamental
problem with Spurgeon’s SCC mem-

SCC handles.

‘The problem is a large majority

“The potential to be perceived as

I just think the accused would have a

ment,’’ Hatcher said

Spurgeon, however, says his re-
maining on the SCC is not hypocriti-
cal,

Spurgeon said he sees the SCC as
a disciplinary BOdy while he views
the EC as a moral authority, and
thinks Hatcher misunderstands funda-
mental differences between the two
bodies,

“On the SCC, we never judge
from a position of higher moral au-

thority,’’ he said. ‘‘It's so different
with the SCC. We don’t deal with
people’s alcohol problem. We deal
with what they do wrong.”’

Spurgeon says he is still capable
and deserves to remain SCC chairman.

‘*We’re trying to come up with a neutral name;
one that doesn’t denote liberal or conservative,’’

Jackson said the magazine has a 17-member
staff which plans to publish its first issue by the

W&L administration have already made contribu-
tions.” Sweeney said the magazine might also sell
advertisements.

Sweeny said they ‘‘always need writers and
artists’’ to help with the magazine. Anyone inter-
ested should contact Sweeney at P.O. Box 50.

‘“T wouldn’t stay on if I didn’t
have the confidence of the SCC,’’ he
said. Spurgeon said the entire SCC
supports him with the exception of
EC Rep. Wight.

‘I’m still the best person for the
job,’’ Spurgeon said.

The EC appoints the SCC chair-
man and accordingly has the power
to remove him, Hatcher said. Spurg-
eon has served as class president and
accordingly SCC member for the past
three years.

He was inducted into Omicron
Delta Kappa leadership honor society
Jan. 18 and was named to Who's
Who Among American College and
University Students this year.

Spurgeon was arrested on Jan. 19
at 1:10 am. After watching the car
Spurgeon was driving head north on
South Main Street, police tailed him
to the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity
house.

At the house, police administered
a breath test to Spurgeon and charged
him with drunk driving, driving reck-
lessly and driving with a revoked
driver’s license.

Spurgeon was first arrested for
drunken driving in Lexington on
March 4 of last year. He was found
guilty of the charge, fined $240 and
his driver’s license was revoked. The

 

 

Tom Spurgeon

court allowed him to retain his li-
cense after he agreed to attend the
Virginia Alcohol Safety Action Pro-
gram.

Spurgeon is set to appear in Gen-
eral District Court on Feb. 26.

Depending on the blood test re-
sults, the EC has three options in
reacting to Spurgeon’s arrests. The
EC could do nothing, request Spur-
geon’s resignation as chairman but
allow him to remain as a member
and class president, or request his
resignation from the SCC as well as
the presidency, Hatcher said.

The EC can remove Spurgeon
from office if he refuses to resign,
Hatcher said. He is unsure who
would replace Spurgeon.

 

Washington and Lee’s chapter

Two people will be inducted
from the class of 1990:

Mary Jeannette Kelley and
Mary Katherine Campbell
Seymour. In addition, two people
will be granted honorary
membership in W&L’s Phi Beta

of classics at the University of
Arizona.

Students are elected to Phi Beta
Kappa through elections held
among the members on the W&L
faculty and staff, according to J.
Brown Goehring, professor of
chemistry and secretary of the
chapter. Law students elected to
Phi Beta Kappa while
undergraduates are also invited to
participate.

The  chapter’s executive
committee examines the records of
each class’ top-ranked students.
From this study, the committee
puts together a list of who might
be eligible for induction. These
results are brought before the
voting members.

“Everyone in the chapter has
their own — guidelines,’’ said
Goehring. ‘‘While I can pretty
much tell who will be considered,
I can not be explicit on who will
be elected.’’

In general, Goehring
recommends a high grade point
average. While election to the
chapter as a senior would probably
require a GPA of around 3.6,
consideration as a junior demands
a GPA in the summa cum laude
range.

The chapter also judges the
quality of the student’s academic
record.

‘There must be a sense of
comprehensiveness in academic
effort and a strong evidence of
scholarship in the liberal arts and

sciences,’’ said Goehring.

‘We desire to promote
education designed towards
liberating one’s mind and

understanding.”’

Phi Beta Kappa forbids its
chapters from exceeding 15 percent
of the student body. W&L’s
chapter rarely surpasses 10 percent.

The Pub Board
makes progress

As is indicated in a letter to the editor elsewhere on
this page, the Washington and Lee Publications Board this
past Monday night denied funding to The Progressive (or
whatever the editors choose to name it), a publication
established by two enterprising W&L freshmen. In that
letter, freshman Alex Ruskell makes clear his
interpretation of events. We intend to use this space to
offer ours.

It is the stated policy of the Pub Board to fund campus
publications that advocate no particular political ideology.
While reasonable minds may differ on the wisdom of that
policy, that remains the parameter by which the magazine
must be judged. In the opinion of the majority of the

our disagreement.

There is without doubt an audience for such a
magazine, an audience which is currently unrepresented in
the Washington and Lee community. However, it is not
permissible, under the current regulations, for the student
body to fund such a periodical.

In his letter, Mr. Ruskell seems to attempt to establish
a link between the members of the Pub Board (which
apparently includes an ‘‘EC stooge,’’ otherwise known as
Representative Giles Perkins) and the Spectator.

Although we are not able to speak for the other
members of the Pub Board, it should by now be clear that

MY VIEW
By Andrew Roper

 

I am puzzled, confused, no...perhaps disillu-
sioned with people today. I stay awake late at

night watching news of war only to be greeted the
following morning with a pop-quiz in one of my
classes. Does war no longer equate with death?

The night of the 15th, students prepared for the

worst. Only a small handful took the time to
remind our campus that war was not the only
option. This group organized a small candlelight
gathering. A reminder to all of us that peace could
be a comerstone in the new world.

Yet some students debased posters advertising

seemingly blind, remain oblivious to the issue until
the deadline had expired. In an attempt to provoke
thought, two friends and myself distributed peace
fliers and banners around the school about a week
before break. We hoped to raise questions like: Is
Bush exhausting all diplomatic means? Can eco-

one man’s inability to solve complicated issues
Placed this nation into an unnecessary war.
These thoughts might not be accepted by
everyone on this campus. That is the price we pay
or the value we receive from living in a democra-
cy. I feel at most I must be able to rely on one
thing. I invoke every student’s intellectual abilities
to ponder this current world crisis. Form opinions
on your own, not from information based solely on
one source. Just because George Bush says Hussein
is insane does not mean he actually is. No more

We wish the editors of The Progressive much luck in
their current endeavor. It has been recently proven that it
is indeed possible to run a publication that is independent
of student body funds. The Pub Board has no choice but
to ask this new magazine, under its original format, to
follow the same path.

crucial for our democracy to allow for free

However, I believe it is equally impertant for
the media and the press to responsibly cover
news and facilitate a balanced discussion on
public issues. Last week’s Phi neglected to
provide equal coverage of this malingering
national issue of racism.

Why did the Phi decide to cover a rally in
Blacksburg, and neglect to cover a Dr. King
Memorial Lecture on Justice and Non-violent
Social Change in Lee Chapel on Friday, January
18th, sponsored by several W&L student
organizations? Why did the Phi include two
photos from that rally and omit coverage of local
college students explaining whet Dr. King’s
dream means to them in a service held at the
First Baptist Church last Monday, January 21st?

Why did the Phi provide a story of an orga-
nization upholding principles of ‘‘hatred, hostility,
bigotry, discrimination and violence’’ (your own
words), and not balance it with local news of
hope, struggles, dreams, love and non-violence?
Why?

that the family has moved in. From my brothers

Atkins reminds

frats not to haze

This seems an appropriate time to remind you
and the W&L community at large that Washing-
ton and Lee University is unequivocally opposed
to hazing in any shape or form. Hazing is ex-
pressly forbidden by University policy, by IFC
by-laws and by all sixteen national fraternities
fepresented on our campus. It is also a violation
of Virginia law. Hazing endangers individuals
and destroys the bonds of trust that must exist
in a strong fraternity chapter, a good fraternity
system and a healthy collegiate community.
Hazing activities which threaten the health or
safety of our students are grounds for the imme-
diate expulsion of a fraternity chapter and indi-
viduals from Washington and Lee University.

Fraternity presidents and pledge educators
must see that no elements of hazing enter into
their chapters’ pledge programs. Pledges must
also accept an obligation not to endanger them-
selves or the future of their chapters by submit-
ting to hazing. Any member of the community
who witnesses or suspects hazing should report
the incident or suspicion to Dean Atkins. A
thorough, fair investigation will be conducted.
There will be no reprisals or retaliation permitted
against anyone who reports such an incident.

The invidious effects of hazing demand that
it not be tolerated in our community. The W&L
Greek system, which is potentially the nation’s
best, must demand a responsible pledge-education
program, free of hazing.

Sincerely,
Leroy ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins

W&L won't allow
different opinions

Last Monday night a proposal for a new
publication that would stress free thought on
campus was denied funding by the Publications
Board. Its goal was to provide a forum where the
Right, the Left, and the Apolitical could express
their views, sharing the same pages to promote
intelligent thought on the issues presented. Of
course, the publication never had a chance.

The Publications Board decided not to fund
the publication on the basis that it would be a
politically liberal forum and they cannot
fund a politically ideological paper. The proposal
for the new publication stressed over and over
again that politics were not its concerns (although
the Pub. Board seems to think everything degen-
erates into politics at the end, such as articles

about the environment and religion). Maybe it

was the presence of an EC stooge with a copy of
the Spectator clutched to his heart and who
couldn’t wait to scream ‘‘Leftist’’ at every
opportunity. Maybe it was a hope that articles
already in progress would be given to the Politi-
cal Review so it would have something to print.
Or maybe it was because ‘‘free-thinking’’ seems
to denote ‘‘liberal’’ (or ‘‘pinko-commie bastard’’)
rather than ‘‘intellectual."’

told that they have the power to do anything they

Thanks SAB for
Jordan concert

Thanks and appreciation are due to everyone
with the Student Activities Board who had a
hand in producing the recent Stanley Jordan
concert. It was a wonderful finale for Founders’
Day.

It was especially nice for it to happen right
here on the main campus rather than out there in
the woods. The sound that resonates off a wood-
en floor beats what bounces off a concrete slab
any time.

Old Doremus sounded as good as I’ve heard
since the Allman Brothers played there 20 years
ago, during my own undergraduate days. Folks
who have been around here longer than myself
tell me that Dave Brubeck, Duke Ellington, and
Louis Jordan (no relation) sounded pretty good
in there, too.

So, again, thank you, SAB, for bringing jazz
back to W&L, and doing it in a way that contin-
ues a fine musical tradition. I hope the interval
until the next time won't be so long.

Sincerely,
W. Patrick Hinely '73

Headline missed
the main point

The headline composed by your staff to
introduce the letter from Daniel Bettendorf in last
week’s issue probably succeeded in provoking
readers, but it missed the mark if it intended to
suggest what the letter was about. I confess to
knowing little about Just-War Theory, but surely
that theory admits the Possibility of such a war
and hence the killing of enemy soldiers under
certain circumstances, Exactly what those circum-

stances should be seems to me to be Mr.
Bettendorf’s point.

Rates rise
4 cents
for stamps

By Cathy Lopiccolo
Assignment Editor

 

Writing home will cost four more
cents starting this Sunday.

The U.S. Postal Service approved
the 29-cent rate for first-class letters
Jan. 22, and post offices began
selling the new stamps last week.

The stamps, which were printed
before the increase was approved,
bear a red tulip and the letter F
instead of a denomination. In
addition, offices are offering four-
cent makeup stamps to be used with
existing 25-cent stamps.

Federal Postmaster Anthony M.
Frank expressed concern that the new
rate will be inconvenient for
customers and may not be high
enough to cover the Postal Service’s
costs. Frank said the service may
have to request.even higher rates, but
did not predict when.

The Postal Service had originally
requested a 30-cent rate, but the
independent Postal Rate Commission
said that rate placed too heavy a
burden on individuals instead of bulk
mailers, In its recommendations, the
Postal Rate Commission included

large increases in: bulk’ mait rates. «°°

‘Although the’ ‘Postat “Service’s

the recommended increases, the board
requested more details on how the
commission arrived at its rate
proposals.

‘*With all the financial pressures
we are facing, we cannot afford to
gamble on whether the rate
commission has correctly estimated
volume and revenue,’’ Frank said. ‘‘If
they erred — and we believe they
have — the recommended rates may
well prove to be ‘penny wise and
pound foolish.’ ”’

me to be replaced by a younger
person,”’ said Coulling, a W&L alum-
nus who has taught here since 1956.

All of the departments with retir-
ing professors have either hired facul-
ty members in the last few years in
anticipation of the loss, or are in the
process of interviewing and hiring
new instructors.

Some departments may also shift
teaching assignments to accommodate
for the changes.

‘‘Most of retirement is a down-
side,"’ said Prof. Hampden H. Smith,
chairman of the department of Jour-
nalism and Mass Communications.
‘*However, it does give you the op-
portunity to reevaluate your courses
and reassign them if you need to.”

All of the retiring professors,
except Barritt and Stephenson — who

declined to comment on his retire-
ment plans — said they will devote
more time to hobbies, traveling and
volunteer work, while continuing
projects in their academic field.

Barritt, who graduated from Was- |

hington and Lee in 1943, said he
doesn’t intend to do anything remote-
ly academic once he retires. He said
he plans to enjoy his favorite hobby,
carpentry, and will continue to donate

his time and carpentry skills to build- jj
ing houses with Habitat for Humani- |

ty, a local charity.
‘I’ve enjoyed my years here, and
I will miss the students and my clas-

ses because they kind of keep me |
young,’’ said Cook, another W&L |

alumnus who was graded in 1943.
‘But I think I'll enjoy the change.
I’m sure going to try, anyway.”

Student Center Committee
seeks input from students

 

By Jennifer Mayo
Staff Reporter

 

A committee of faculty and stu-
dents is currently planning a large
student center to provide a focal point
for campus life.

Students will have a chance to
voice their opinions about the pro-
posed center in a questionnaire en-
closed in today’s Phi.

Still in its earliest stages, this
planning remains tentative, and the
committee would like both faculty
and students to know the options for
the building.

Associate Dean of Students for
Greek Affairs Leroy ‘‘Buddy’’ At-
kins, Engineering Professor Robert
Akins and two members of the plan-
ning committee traveled through the
midwest last summer to visit other
colleges’ student centers.

‘*‘We want this student center to
be a combination of the best ones we
visited,’’ said Atkins.

So far, the planned center would
include a snack bar similar to the Co-
op, and entertainment area, an ex-
panded bookstore, a post-office and
UPS package center, a convenience
store, several recreation rooms, stu-
dent organization offices, meeting

rooms, a music store, lounges, offices
for the Dean of Students and his
staff, and a large special events room.

This special events room would
hold 400 people for dancing, 350 for
dining, and 500 to 600 for lectures
and concerts.

The Co-op and bookstore would
be renovated to become part of the
Commerce School.

“The center of the campus will
shift, but that is just what we are
looking for,’’ said Prof. Robert
deMaria. ‘‘We are trying to unify the
W&L student body -_ under-
graduates, law students and profes-
sors.’’

Princeton eating club
forced to admit women

 

By Craig Burke
Staff Reporter

 

A Supreme Court refusal last
week that forced an all-male eating
club at Princeton University to admit
women will” have little effect, on

¢’s ‘fraternities at Washington and Lee.
Board of Governors approved most of ~ ‘ Several national fratemities’ felt’.

the court’s refusal to hear arguments
in Tiger Inn v. Frank posed a threat
to their existence.

The New Jersey Supreme Court
had ruled earlier that Tiger Inn, a
social organization and a dining hall,
must admit women this spring when
it chooses new members. The
Supreme Court stated that this
decision did not interfere with the
club’s constitutional right of freedom
of association.

John Neslage, ’91, Houston, TX
- ‘It’s simple — pity.’

 Bezanson said, .

Greek Affairs Leroy ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins
and Dean of the School of Law
Randall Bezanson said they believe
the ruling will have no _ legal
implications for fraternities at W&L.

Since the Tiger Inn case involves

a New Jersey statute, it will have a.

direct affect -

eH
\ **Mosg ; aided have ..,:.anti-
discrimination laws and will decide
this issue on their own, The New
Jersey ruling sets no precedent in
other states,’’ he said.

Similarly, Atkins said there is no
correlation between the Tiger Inn
case and fraternities at W&L.

Though the Supreme Court’s
decision not to hear the case is
legally insignificant, Bezanson said it
does raise some interesting questions.

One such question involves state
and federal anti-discrimination statutes

any WARE Ose

that contain exceptions for private
organizations. The definition of
private differs from state to state and
could have some bearing on future
rulings.

The New Jersey Supreme Court
_ ruled that Tiger Inn was not a private

only, in that Stdte/ * Organization due~to~its close ties to
5 Princeton University. This might |
university-affiliated ,

imply; that
organizations may be less likely to
claim privacy.

Bezanson also said that the ruling
shows that claims of protected private
association based on gender are less
persuasive than claims based on other
factors such as religious beliefs.

“The claim of a fraternity or
sorority to exclude men or women
based on associational privacy may
be relatively weak unless coupled
with another claim such as living
arrangements,’ Bezanson said.

The Ring-tum Phi, January 31, 1991

By Jay Plotkin

| Sports Editor

 

The Washington and Lee basket-

“| ball team scored a major upset Tues-
“{day night by beating Emory and
| Henry 88-77 behind 19 points and 13

rebounds from senior forward Craig

1 Hatfield.

The key Old Dominion Athletic
Conference win ended a four-game
losing streak for W&L, who played
two starters on the road
against the eighth-ranked team in the
nation.

‘We had quite a scenario to deal

 

 

with,’’ said head coach Verne Can-
field. ‘‘We had two starters out and
we were going to play on the floor
of the eighth-ranked team in the
nation who had just lost for the first
time.”’
The

Generals played without

i sophomore guard Bryan Watkins, who

is out for the year with a broken
right wrist. Senior center Chris Jacobs

 

came off the bench, but sprained his
ankle six minutes into the game and
is out for seven to ten days.

But, Canfield said, the team did
what it needed to do to compensate
for the injuries.

‘We had some kids come off the
bench and play tremendous games
and one player who was just put
back in the starting lineup who
played what may have been his best
game at W&L,’’ said Canfield.

Hatfield, despite picking up his
fourth foul early in the second half,
scored 10 of his 19 points and grab-
bed five of his 13 rebounds in the
second half.

W&L scored the first four points
of the half to tie the score at 44 and
surged out to a 63-58 lead. But E&H
went on a 7-0 run, capped by Cary
Perkins’ three pointer, to take a 65-
63 lead with 7:27 left.

From there, the Generals took
control of the game. W&L closed the
game with a 25-12 run to earn the
88-77 win over the Wasps, who were

previously ranked second in Division
Il.

W&L held E&H to just 23 per-
cent shooting in the second half and
allowed only eight field goals after
the Wasps hit on 61 percent of their
shots in the first half. After attempt-
ing only two free throws in the first
half, W&L converted 20 of 27 shots
from the line to ice the game.

“Once we got the lead above
three points in the second half, they
{E&H] kind of panicked,’’ said Hat-
field. ‘‘They started fouling, and then
we knew we had the win.”’

Hatfield’s 19 points and 13 re-
bounds were both season highs. Hat-
field got help from some familiar
faces. Senior forward Ed Hart scored
15 points despite fouling out in only
17 minutes and senior guard Mike
Holton scored 10 of his 13 points in
the second half.

W&L also got big games from
two new faces. Junior John With-
erington made his first start of the
year and scored a career-high 14

, Generals top No. 8 E&H 88-77

points, eight in the second half. Clas-
smate Courtney Penn was a defensive '
stalwart, grabbing eight of his career- _

high nine rebounds in the second half
and blocking two shots while scoring
six points.

With the win, W&L improves to '
9-10, 5-7 on the season. The Gen- ,

erals will take on a Virginia Wes-

leyan team Saturday that has lost five °

of six games. W&L will not play a
home game until Feb. 6 against Ran-
dolph-Macon, currently the seventh-
ranked team in Division III.

Indoor track starts
season on right foot

The Ring-tum Phi, January 31, 1991

 

 

By George Sakin
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee indoor
track and field teams had strong
showings in their first competition of
the year at last weekend’s Lynchburg
Invitational.

“I’m very encouraged and have to
tone down my excitement,’’ said
women’s head coach John Tucker
about his team’s performance.

Senior captain Sarah Bolte paced
the team with a victory in the high
Jump. Sophomore Kelli Klick set a
school record in finishing third in the
shot put. W&L outpointed the four
other women’s teams competing at
the meet.

According to Tucker, the team has
a lot of freshmen and first-year mem-
bers who will form the nucleus of the
team. This team is one of Tucker’s
largest and he has been able to enter
runners in every event. Because of
the size of the team, Tucker has high

| €xpectations.

“I’m very hopeful and expect to
see a national qualifying team,’’ he

i .
' said,

Bolte echoed her coach’s thoughts.
‘‘We have a strong team this year
with a lot of depth,’’ she said. ‘*Look

: for us to be on top in the Old Do-

| minion Athletic Conference.”’

The women will be in action this
weekend at the Virginia Tech
Woman’s Invitational in Blacksburg.

The men’s team plans to surprise
a lot of people behind the perform-
ances of tri-captains David Johnston,
David Martin and Jeff Baucum.

“The captains have looked real

head coach Norris Aldridge. ‘‘They’re
good leaders and have set a good
example for the rest of the team.’’

Aldridge says that although this
team is inexperienced, there is talent
there to develop. In the sprint events,
the Generals will look to replace Wes
Boyd and Scott Williams. In the
hurdles, junior David Phillips has
shown promise, and freshman Tom
Mandia will run both sprints and
hurdles,

The distance events will be one of
the team’s stronger points this year.
Aldridge said Martin, a junior, and
Baucum, a senior, as well as junior
Lee Parker, and sophomores Keith
Rinn and Bo Hannah to earn points.
Martin set a new school record of
4:16.1 in the indoor mile last week-
end,

In the field events, W&L will
look to their veterans for big per-
formances. Senior Craig Irons had a
personal best of 6-4 in the high jump
in Lynchburg. Junior Jim Henry won
the shot put with a personal best toss
of 45-1/2 feet and should be one of
the top performers in the ODAC.
Johnston did well in the pole vault,
and Aldridge thinks he will finish
near the top of the conference. John-
ston may also help out in the sprints.

‘‘We work hard in the indoor
season as part as our training for
outdoor,’ said Johnston. ‘‘We’ll
surprise a lot of people in the confer-
ence.””

The men will be in action Satur-
day at the VMI Relays.

Pilkey, Soderberg lead
Generals in Invitational

 

By Chris Simon
Staff Reporter

 

Two Washington and Lee wres-
tlers finished second in their weight
classes to lead W&L to a sixth-place
finish in last weekend’s W&L Invita-
tional.

Senior co-captain Larry Pilkey
advanced to the finals in the 126-
pound class before losing to Furman’s
Duke Labasi. The second-place finish
was Pilkey’s best of the season.

Junior co-captain Peer Soderberg
recorded two wins in his 177-pound
weight class before falling in over-
time in the finals.

Bob Weaver of Messiah beat
Soderberg 4-2 in overtime in the
finals. It was Weaver’s second win
over Soderberg this year.

Senior Bill Avery turned in his
best performance of the year, finish-
ing fourth in the 150-pound class.
Avery won twice to reach the conso-
lation finals.

Despite the success of W&L’s top
performers, Franke said he was disap-
pointed that several more of his wres-
tlers didn’t place.

W&L will travel to participate in
the Mid-South Tournament this week-
end. An injury to sophomore Rich
Paini (118-pounds) has head coach
Gary Franke worried that his team
won't have a lot of time to improve
before the tournament.

‘*We’ll face some tough competi-
tion in this week’s tournament,”’ said
Franke. ‘‘It should be the strongest
one we've had this year.’

Struggle goes on
for W&L swimmers

 

By Randall Ellis
Staff Reporter

 

Frustration and relief are how
head coach Page Remillard summed
up his feelings over Washington and
Lee’s losses to George Washington
this past weekend.

Both the men’s and women’s
teams dropped their fourth straight
meet, the men losing 104-76 and the
women 105-85. =

‘‘We had a lot of good swims
and some personal best from our
swimmers but we kept up coming up
short place-wise,”’ said Remillard.

For the men, junior Doug Brown
won the 1000-yard freestyle with a
time of 10:23.81. Senior Jim Dun-
levy took home first in the 500-
freestyle with a time of 5:01.26 and
classmate Tomas Perez captured the
200-yard breaststroke in 2:26.16.

For the women, super sophomores
led the way. Stephanie Sauers won
the 100-yard freestyle with a time of
1:00.05 and Claire Dudley captured
first in the 200-yard breaststroke,
clocking in at 2:34.09.

Remillard said the lack of his
teams providing a comparable level
of competition has been a problem

larger teams,”’ said Remillard.

On the women’s side tough, the
ODAC has been able to provide the
necessary competition with rivals like
Hollins and Sweet Briar. The women
will next swim against Hollins.

‘This meet will be a can’t loose
situation. The girls really want the
win and they will be going after it,”’
said Remillard.

The teams have the coming week-
end off as far as competition goes
and this will allow them to get in
some intense training.

‘This break in the action will be
welcome,’’ said Remillard. ‘‘Once we
start competing again we will be into
the Division III and championship
part of our schedule, so we should
Start to be more competitive.’’

The women (1-4) will travel to
Hollins for their meet on February 8
and the men (0-4) will wait till Febr-
uary 9 when both teams swim against
Mary Washington.

Misery, ‘'m your biggest fan!’

 

By Stephanie McHaney
Staff Reporter

 

Master of the horror story, Ste-
phen King has done it again.

Misery is by far the best film
version of a King novel. Cujo, Carrie
and Christine, on the other hand, are
all examples of a producer mutilating
a relatively good horror story. How
can one forget the rabid clown chas-
ing fifth graders through the sewer
system in the made-for-television ver-
sion of [T?

Until now, film producers seemed
unable to capture the unnerving fear
King stimulates in his novels. Final-
ly, however, a producer has done jus-
lice to one of King’s stories. No

psychologically stable person should
leave the theatre relaxed after he sees
Misery.

The novel’s protagonist, romance
novelist Paul Sheldon ,(James Caan)
is desperately trying to end his suc-
cessful Misery Chastain series. When
Sheldon finishes his new book in
which Misery dies, he heads home
from his Colorado hideaway. Luckily
for Sheldon, Nurse Annie Wilkes
(Kathy Bates) rescues Sheldon from
a near fatal car accident after his car
goes off the road in a blizzard.
Wilkes takes Sheldon to her Green
Acres from Hell, made complete with
a pig named after Sheldon’s Misery
character. While nursing Sheldon
back to health, Wilkes reads
Sheldon’s newly released Misery

The Ring-tum Phi, January 31, 1991
nae

novel...and so the terror begins.

Misery literally keeps the viewer
on the edge of his seat. Fortunately
for those with weak hearts, Reiner
made the most of the black humor in
King’s novel. Thus, the viewer expe-
riences a few warped, but funny
moments.

Misery stands apart from typical
horror flicks for several reasons.
First, there isn’t a single scene with
a teenager spurting blood from a
major artery. Reiner does not subject
the viewers to the infamous and
grotesque hobbling  scene...sound
effects are sufficient. Reiner leaves
that to the viewers imagination. The
most outstanding characteristic of this
movie is the simplicity of the sets. A
majority of the film takes place in

Sheldon’s room in Wilkes’ home.
Reiner kept the props simple, which
serves to enhance the simplicity of
Nurse Wilkes’ deranged thought pro-
cesses,

Kathy Bates’ performance of the
deranged Annie Wilkes makes Misery
a truly incredible movie. It’s likely
that the viewer’s overactive imagina-
tion will frighten him more than any
action on the screen.

Rob Reiner managed to produced
a spine-tingling movie based on char-
acter development rather than on
repeated massacres. The majority of
the movie simply consists of conver-
sation between Wilkes and Sheldon.

Misery, I'm your "number one
fan!!"

Keydet General’s new Sports Bar
offers W&L the whole ten yards

 

By George Sakin
Staff Reporter

 

Students and sports fans have
found a different environment and
alternate social life due to the open-
ing of Lexington’s newest establish-
ment, The Sports Bar.

‘‘T’m a sports enthusiast, I like
those types of bars. It provides an
atmosphere everyone is comfortable
in,’ said Pat Gallavan, a senior from
Lake Forest, Ill.

The Sports Bar celebrated its
grand opening at the Best Western’s

Keydet General last Tuesday night.
The bar offered drink specials and
free food for the occasion.

The idea for a sports bar in Lex-
ington was proposed by a profession-
al management company which has
worked with other franchise hotels
and independent restaurants.

‘‘We had success in other areas
with a sports bar,’’ said Tim Back,
manager of the bar, ‘‘You can find a
general mix of people who like the
idea, 21-year-olds to 50-year-olds.”’

Several students seem to agree
with the bar’s style. Decorated with
posters, pennants, and equipment

trom your favorite sports teams, the
objects serve to promote conversation
and a warm atmosphere.

“I think it is good and it reminds
me of bars I go to at home,’’ said
Tucker Walsh, a senior from Bronx
ville, N.Y:

“It’s the first real bar in Lexing-
ton,’’ added Gallavan.

As the new establishment in the
area, the Sports Bar is looking to use
advantages to build a clientele.

“Our location outside the city
limits is an disadvantage to students

have a designated driver,’’ said Back,

‘‘the guy from the Palm’s said he
liked our place but our prices were
killing him.”’

The advantages seem to be work-
ing for now. Promotions have in-
cluded such things as a Super Bowl
party and drink specials. Plans call
for an outside deck to be built for
use in warmer months.

With the reasonable prices and a
comfortable atmosphere, students will
continue to patronize the Sports Bar,
even if they don’t appreciate the
style.
