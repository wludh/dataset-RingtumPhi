Hill says phase one on time

Parsons and contractor optimistic, architect has doubts

Fraternity Renaissance is on schedule and the
phase one renovations will be completed on time,
Washington and Lee director of capital planning
Frank Parsons said. But architects handling the
renovations doubt that phase one can be com-
pleted by January.

“T have no reason to believe otherwise,’’
Parsons said, ‘‘Bass Construction has said that
they are proceeding on schedule and will be
finished with the current renovations by Janu-

Bill Shirey, site supervisor for Bass Construc-
tion, said the company originally had some
problems with a few of the sub-contractors
working on the houses, but that now everything
is back on schedule.

But Architect~David Oakland of the -Char-
lottsville firm VMDO, which is he: ‘ling all the
renovations, disagreed.‘‘They coul’” have every
contractor in Southwest Virginia working on
those houses full-time and they still wouldn’t
finish on time.’’

Oakland noted that there were delays at the
beginning of the project in the spring as Bass
began hiring and organizing a largely local work
force that now numbers 70.

‘‘They had to find and hire all these people.

Phase two will start faster since Bass will already
have its work force in place,’’ he said.

The university is renovating six W&L frater-
nity houses, including those in Red Square —
near the intersection of Henry and Jefferson Str-
eets — and Sigma Alpha Epsilon, in exchange
for the house’s land titles.

Other fraternities will follow suit in the
second phase of the Fraternity Renaissance. Their
houses will be vacated and renovated after the
compeltion of phase one.

Construction on the SAE house is scheduled
to be finished by November. SAE members will
not, however, re-occupy their house until Red
Square fraternity members move back into their
houses.

Houses will have new heating, plumbing, and
electrical systems. Most of the floors have been
re-configured to make better use of the space,
and extensive landscaping work is being done.

At the Red Square houses; werkers -are~still~

using jackhammers and rock crushers in the
basements, and the upper floors have only bare
stud walls and loose, disconnected pipes. Bull-
dozers push piles of old bricks and concrete
around the backyards and new foundation walls
are being built.

Over at SAE, sheetrock contractors walk
around on stilts to finish touch-up work on the
ceilings and electricians are installing recessed
lighting in the hallways. Cleaned and patched

radiators have been returned to the rooms, ready
to be connected to the new furnace.

Shirey said that wherever possible, original
moldings and hardware have been saved from the
houses and will be re-hung in order to maintain
the unique character of each house.

Houses will get new hard-wood main floors,
concrete or tile floors in the basements and
carpet on the upper floors.

Each fraternity must meet the University’s
new Standards for Fraternities. Among other
things, these guidelines require that houses hire
a live-in resident advisor, install a sprinkler
system and other safety devices, and build a
separate area for parties that can be closed off
from the rest of the house.

Parsons said all fraternities are participating in
the University’s funding program except Chi Psi
and Sigma Phi Epsilon. Phi Gamma Delta,
whose house was rebuilt after being destryoed by
va~fire> in~1984,~ulready «meets -the- University
Standards.

Kappa Sigma will move across the street
from Lambda Chi Alpha into the old Zeta Beta
Tau house, which is scheduled for renovation in
phase two. Their old house will become Univer-
sity property and might be used to house a
sorority.

Parsons says that the University has not yet
received an application to participate from Kappa
Alpha, but they assume KA will participate.

Although former Washington and

for involuntary manslaughter and

involved,’’ said Lillian DeVenney, the
chairwoman of Virginians Opposed to

every year by drunk drivers. That’s
forever, they’re never coming back.

Although his trial was held Aug.

part of the six-month sentence im-

Thomas Spencer, before the trial.

‘The severity of the sentence is

Geimer. ‘‘Sentencing is supposed to
be an individual matter for each
judge concerning the offense and the

“‘T believe he (Comer) should

Geimer said, if a defendant is

Comer’s sentence came in a time
when judges are becoming more

such crimes. Last month, in Norfolk,

W&L

Tight budget causes
cuts at 49 campuses

 

By Tracey Thornblade
Staff Reporter

 

The United States Army an- °

nounced in July that it would deac-
tivate Washington and Lee’s Officer
Training Corps program after this
school year, along with programs at
49 other college campuses.

As budget cuts in the military are
made, the number of troops are re-
duced. Consequently, fewer junior
officers are needed to fill the ranks.

The deactivation of ROTC
programs around the nation was
based on each program’s viability.
The United States Army judges
viability according to enrollment
figures, the number of officers a
program produces and the quality of
the officers.

‘*Quality has never been a prob-
lem at W&L,’’ Lt. Col. Joel J. Snow,
chairman of W&L’s Military Science
Department, said. For nearly 40 yea-
rs, the program has produced fine
officers, Snow said, but ‘‘Our num-
bers have been consistently low for
the past six years.’’

~ W&k's-pregram was placed under
‘region intensive management,’’ a
form of probation, four years ago.
At that time, the department intensi-
fied its recruiting efforts, but the
results were not sufficient to keep
ROTC on campus.

The ROTC program will continue
to operate at W&L this year. Twen-
ty-three returning cadets, along with
seven freshmen scholarship recipients,
will participate. No new students will

possible prison term of 10 years, and
felony hit and run is punishable by
five years.

However, Geimer said that state
judges are not bound by precedent in
sentencing.

Following his release from the
Rockbridge County jail, Comer will
be placed on probation for an addi-
tional five years, the terms of which
will be implemented at that time.

Because Comer withdrew from
W&L as a student in good standing,
he is eligible to apply for readmission
to school. Comer has not said wheth-

be admitted.

Once the program is deactivated,
all cadets will have the option of
leaving the program with no obliga-
tion to the Army, transferring to
another school that has an Army
ROTC program or completing the
program at W&L under the direction
of the Virginia Military Institute’s
ROTC personnel.

VMI will begin conducting the
ROTC program at W&L in the fall
of 1991 using the same program. Col.
James Joyner of the Army ROTC
program at VMI said one of their
goals will be to ‘‘keep the spirit and
identity of the W&L cadets at the
same level as before.’’

There are no plans to continue
ROTC at W&L with VMI’s personnel
after the current freshmen class
graduates in 1994. ‘‘More man-
power would be needed to continue
the program in the long-term,’’ Joy-
ner said.

Tim Wolff, a sophomore cadet,
said that he first heard about the
closure at the end of the summer.
Wolff said that he was ‘‘surprised’’
because ROTC has been on campus
for-so long and there are so many
ROTC-related activities to participate
in. He plans to remain in the
program and complete his training
with VMI’s personnel.

“‘ROTC has been a tradition at
Washington and Lee for the past
forty years,’’ Wolff said. ‘‘The values
that we often associate with W&L -
- honor, service to country, service to
humanity — are the same set of
values that ROTC represents.”’

IFC ears closed to excuses

 

By Jason Kelley
Senior Copy Editor

 

‘Ignorance will not be an excuse’’ for
freshmen who go to fraternity parties before
Rush has begins, Interfraternity Council
President Goodloe Lewis said at the first
+ IFC meeting of the year Tuesday night.

Some potential pledges this year at-
* tempted to attend fraternity parties over the
weekend despite Rush rules prohibiting off-
campus contact, Lewis told the council, and
» he will accept ‘tno more excuses.”’

He noted, however, that some freshmen
were unaware of the casual contact rule that
, remains in effect until contact is allowed
Friday night.

In response to these problems, Lewis and
IFC vice-president Mike Skarda posted
flyers in freshmen dorms advising freshman
‘ men that they would lose Rush privilidges

for a year if they were caught breaking

Rush rules,

, Lewis warned that watchful dorm coun-
selors would report to him if the freshmen
were ‘‘coming in late at night throwing up
all over the place because they got drunk at
a fraternity party.”’

Lewis scheduled the next IFC meeting
for Sept. 18, three days before rush ends.

Associate Dean of Students for Greek

Affairs Leroy ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins echoed
Lewis’ point that ignorance of Rush rules
would not be considered an excuse for rule
violations.

‘The old palms-up salute just doesn’t
cut it anymore,’’ he said. ‘‘There shouldn’t
be any Rush violations. There’s just no
reason for them because you know the rules
now.”’

Noting that there are 30 fewer freshman
men enrolled this year than last and that
usually 75 percent pledge a fraternity, Skar-
da said ‘‘If we cooperate and let them have
a good fraternity experience during Rush so
they’re turned on by the system .., we
should look for 90 percent to pledge.”’

Atkins agreed. ‘‘The ideal is for every-
one to get 15 pledges; the idea is for every-
one to just be in a fraternity, to be able to
have the fraternity experience. The idea is
not for one house to beat out another.”’

Atkins also warned that fraternitites need
to be especially careful not to serve alcohol
to the freshmen as they come through Rush
in the next two weeks.

Because some fraternities will hold rush
functions on athletic fields as a result of
Fraternity Renovation, Atkins warned about
the potential danger of an intoxicated per-
son walking home along Route 60.

‘*You never know when some local
wahoo is going to come roaring over that

hill in a pick-up truck and then it’s bye-
bye,’’ he said. ‘‘People would blame the
fraternity system at W&L for allowing this
dangerous situation to occur.”’

Skarda, who’s role as IFC vice-president
designates him as IFC Rush Chairman, ex-
plained to the committee how rush would
work this year.

All this week freshman men and fraterni-
ty members are only allowed to be in casual
contact while on the hill.

On Friday night during the band perfor-
mance at the student activities pavillion, the
two groups will be able to meet each oth-
er, but no fraternity members are allowed to
offer freshmen rides to or from the event.

Saturday after the W&L football game,
freshmen are allowed to be at fraternity
houses or at other locations with members
until 7 p.m.

Contact is then closed again until 8 p.m.
when freshmen may attend parties thrown by
fraternities.

Freshmen who intend to go through
Formal Rush must attend a Rush orientation
meeting 1 p.m. Sunday in Lee Chapel.
There, the procedure will be explained by
Skarda and Lewis.

Formal Rush begins at the shot of the
gun at 6:45 Monday night when Fraternity
members will begin picking up freshmen for
the first Open Houses,

New card to make W&L
a campus free of cash

 

By Cathy Lopiccolo
Assignment Editor

 

Now that you have the University Card,
what can you do with it? Eventually, you’ll
be able to do a lot, Washington and Lee’s
Assistant Treasurer John Cuny said.

The University Card not only replaces
the old student I.D.’s, it will replace copier
cards, point cards and bookstore charge
cards, Washing and drying machines and
vending machines are also being adapted to
accept the card.

‘‘Wherever cash is used on campus, the
University Card will take its place. It will
be a full service card in every sense of the
word,’’ Cuny said.

The card’s features will be phased in
throughout the year, depending on when the
university buys or leases the necessary
equipment. Cuny estimated the price tag for
the card readers and a central computer at
about $100,000,

Students should be able to use their
University Cards for copying by Oct. 1.
Cuny said the bookstore and food services
will be equipped to use it by winter term.

The University Card is ‘‘a step above’’
similar cards at other schools because it
gives students the ability to charge some
purchases, Cuny said.

‘‘We do what most colleges do not. We
put charging as a possible option. Most
cards like this operate on a declining
balance, but ours can do both,”’ Cuny said.

The card has two magnetic strips that
contain account information. The bottom, or
‘‘off-line,’’ strip functions like the one on
copier cards used now. Students will
purchase credit from the Business Office,
and when the University Card is used, the
cost will be deducted from the student's
existing balance.

The wider, ‘‘on-line’’ strip contains a

student’s account number. Food and
bookstore purchases will be relayed to a
central computer that will tally each

student’s total charges. Students or their
parents will be billed monthly. The Business
Office can also deactivate lost or stolen

cards.

Cuny said the card might someday be
used to charge tickets to activities like
Fancy Dress, and to monitor elections by
limiting each student to one vote.

OPINION |

Business ethics in
fraternity Rush

Next week, it’s going to get serious. Fraternity Rush,
by this time next week, will have begun in earnest. Open
houses, rush dates, and also the occasional party will fill
the social calender.

Rush is no longer quite as lighthearted as it once was,
however. Fraternities no longer enjoy the lofty, protected
Status either at W&L or nationwide. Here, Rush is now
cutthroat competition for an ever-dwindling number of
potential pledges.

The numbers are clear. Washington and Lee may soon
not be able to successfully support 16 fraternities. With
the Fraternity Renaissance, each house’s costs will rise
greatly.

How do you defray those costs? Get more members.
To do that, you have to have big pledge classes each
year. Increasingly, houses are deciding that the answer to
this Catch-22 is simple...you cheat.

The present environment is a dangerous one. Each
house feels compelled to break Rush regulations because
if it doesn’t, the members feel other houses gain an
enormous advantage. This can result is games of one-
upsmanship between competing houses.

The only people who lose in this are the houses, who
can be fined upwards of $1,000 for repeated violations,
and the freshmen, who could lose their precious Rush
privileges.

Attempting to evade Rush regulations must surely be
a practice as old as Rush itself. However, these days, the
stakes are much higher than they ever have been for the
whole fraternity system. If the faculty perceives that
fraternities are unable to regulate themselves, they will be
more than happy to regulate it for them.

For fraternities, we believe, that is not an acceptable
option for a number of reasons.

Virtually every fraternity was founded on the principle
that such organizations build character in its members. If
the houses at W&L cannot enforce the rules they
themselves enacted, does that not betray a lack of
character?

Also, we fear that some members of the faculty, in
their haste to limit fraternities, may also eliminate what
makes fraternities special.

In our opinion, the only solution is for the
Interfraternity Council to fairly and equally enforce its
Rush regulations.

Rest assured, the Hill will be watching Rush very
closely. It’s time for W&L’s fraternities to prove
something to them, and to themselves.

Howison talks to the Phi |

New Dean of Students supports fall Rush, |
PHC voice on Student Conduct Committee |

 

MY VIEW

By David Howison
with Chris Baradel

 

PHI: I think there is a lot of confusion among
the student body as to what exactly the Dean of
Students does. Could you shed some light on that?

HOWISON: First of all, I have administrative

responsibility for’ staff, ‘so ‘on’ Gné ‘level its ‘pure ”
administration. My own personal philosophy. is,

that; you get good people, don’t try to over-
manage; you give a lot of autonomy to people.

I see myself as an educator with ideas about
education and whenever I have a chance I'll try
to present those ideas. I also see myself as very
formally being charged by the president through
the Board of Trustees to support certain rules and
regulations, but I don’t want to be preoccupied
with that.

What I try to do is encourage student leaders to
be responsible. Ninety-nine percent of the time it
will work, but that one percent of the time it
doesn’t work, there has to be accountability.

PHI: What do you think of the fraternity re-
naissance program? Was it a good investment?

HOWISON: I think Washington and Lee has
made absolutely the right decision. There’s not a
school in America that has made a commitment
comparable in terms of strengthening the fraternity
system.

I tend to look at it not just as a fraternity issue,
but also as a residential issue. These are houses,
and obviously they will house several hundred
men...[ would say when this project is completed
in two years, Washington and Lee will have a
fraternity system that is physically incomparable.

PHI: Can it be said you think perhaps your
role will be more one of overseeing the people in
charge of the fraternity system rather than getting
personally invoived in every aspect of fraternities?

HOWISCN: Absolutely. I have — great
confidence ir. Buddy Atkins; and I’ve got confi-
dence in the leadership of the Interfraternity Cou-
ncil, so it remains to be seen just how direct I’ll
be involved in this...I see [running fraternities] as

* a cooperative adventure, and its obviously one of

the major challenges of this job.

PHI: There’s a rumor going around campus
that when you were at St. Lawrence three
fraternities were closed down. Could you comment
on that rumor?

HOWISON: I’ve heard a couple of people say

I was brought here to "shape up" the fraternities;
I hope people will find out that’s not my personal
professional style. I don’t see’ myself as a hard-
nosed person coming in here to shape up anything,
I think what we’ve got here is absolutely
extraordinary. Its a matter of refining it.

Now to your question, "were three houses
suspended?" I think two were. Both were reinstated
and both are in good standing at this point, but
yes, when I was there in the course of six years,

_because of really extraordinary problems in the two .
houses, thousands, of dollars worth. of. damage:

during .a certain specific time, houses were
suspended...I have to be frank with you, one of the
things I caution myself about is reflecting too
much on my past, because I’m here at Washington

I really want to concentrate on what we can do
here and now. I’d like to see fraternities maintain
high standards, emphasize academics, have great
responsible social life, establish close friendships
and get involved in spirited intramural competition,
which I understand is really an important part of
the fraternity experience right now.

I’d also like to see in the long run...a balance
in student activities outside the classroom in all
areas, whether its athletics, or independent students,
or the development of a student activities center, so
that even though maybe 80% of the men belong to
fraternities, the 20% or so that aren’t don’t feel
excluded,

PHI: The faculty has shown support for a plan
to move fraternity Rush to the winter. What’s your
feeling about the current Rush system, and what
are your views of the proposal to move Rush to
the winter?

HOWISON: I’ll be very interested to see how
the Rush program works. If things work, I don’t
think there’s much of an interest to change them.

PHI: Where do you stand on the question of
the interests of the faculty verses the interests of
the students?

HOWISON: I see a balance there. Students
have the primary focus on their lives, but I will
look very carefully at what the faculty believe and
the one thing that I guarantee is that there is an
open discussion of all of this.

On some issues the faculty have more input,
obviously in the classroom, than students, on other
issues relative to student life, students have more
input.

PHI: The IFC has input into the Student
Conduct Committee, but the Panhellenic Council
does not. Do you think this is fair?

HOWISON: No, it’s not fair. It doesn’t make

’

sense to me that the Interfraternity Council is
represented, but for some reason the Panhellenic
Council is not. I have not had a chance to talk to
the president of the Panhellenic Council but I look
forward to meeting her and getting her thoughts
about it...absolutely the Panhellenic Council ought
to be directly represented as far as I can tell.
PHI: How do you think the increase in the
academic credentials of the incoming freshmen
class has impacted the student body? Do you think
that the character of the student body has been

_ sacrificed for the school’s academic reputation?

HOWISON: I certainly hope we haven’t seen
the death of the well-rounded student because
that’s a hallmark of Washington and Lee. If the
climate the students come to supports the idea of
a well-rounded education, then a student’s SAT
scores aren’t really going to make that much
difference. ’

I guess that the new admissions standards have
in fact made some changes, but I can’t believe it’s
fundamentally changed the character of W&L.
Women certainly have. I’ve got to believe that’s
one of the best decisions the university has made.

PHI: What are your views on the Conduct
Review Committee? Where do you stand on the
problem of the right of privacy for the person who
is accusing verses the right to an open public trial
for the accused?

HOWISON: I think that a residential college
should establish some reasonable guidelines that
deal with cases of date rape and sexual assault if
their existing judicial system is not equipped to do
so. My impression is that the judicial network here
would have a tremendous problem dealing with a
real case of sexual assault. : :

I support the concept of the CRC, but the key
to it is having honorable men and women involved
in the system. You can have the best system in the
world, but if you’ve got people in that system who
have a preconceived notion of what should happen,
you’ve got problems.

As I understand it from talking to Anece
McCloud, she dealt with quite a few cases, but
none were forwarded to the CRC. To me, that
would be the ideal, where a person would feel free
to come forward with a concern and hopefully the
people could work things out. The existence of a
CRC does encourage the possibility that a victim
would more likely come forward then if he or she
had to go before an open forum.

PHI: What you think about W&L making

Q Please see Howison page 4

Equal justice for all at W&L

 

MY VIEW
By Brian Root

 

‘‘Whoever said that this world
was fair?’’

How many times were you told
that as a child? Your parents, teach-
ers, or various other authority figures
probably told you this when they
couldn’t think of a better answer to
one of your questions or complaints.

Nevertheless, the message is a
good one. The world isn’t fair. Want
proof? Blake Comer could be out of
jail by Halloween. If he so chooses,
he can, upon his release, apply for
readmission to Washington and Lee,

Now, you may say something like
‘Yeah, but there’s no way they
weuld ever let him back in.’’

But, as Bart Sizxpson says in the

Butterfinger commercial, ‘‘au con-
traire, mon frere.”’

Imagine yourself as a member of
the readmissions committee. You are
presented with a student who with-
drew from W&L while still a student
in good standing. Yes, he committed
a terrible crime, but has he not paid
his debt to society? There can be no
doubt of his remorse for what he has
done. After all, he started crying
during the trial, didn’t he?

Let’s take another example. Let's
say, hypothetically, that a student
accused of raping another student is
taken before the CRC. Because the
vast majority of rapes go unreported
to the police, no formal criminal
charges are filed by the victim.

The CRC finds the student guilty
and expels him from school. How-
ever, it stipulates that the student may
be readmitted after one year if he

undergoes therapy for his disorder.
He does so, and is subsequently
readmitted.

One more hypothetical example. A
student is thrown out of school be-
cause he turns in another student's
homework for his own, even though
he wasn’t aware that the work was
not in fact his.

Because, as the White Book
States, ‘ignorance is not an excuse,’
the EC has no choice but to find the
student guilty.

College life and life in the real
world, as our professors are eager to
remind us, are very different. No one
can confuse the stress of 10 a.m.
accounting class with commuting to
your job every morning.

Unfortunately, there is one aspect
of real-world life from which not
even the ivory tower of academia can
protect us. Injustice

there 1s one difference. At W&L,
injustice is a little bit easier to fight.
For years, the call has gone out for
volunteers to serve on the White
Book Revisions Committee. Until last
spring, the call went largely ignored
by students. As the committee works
to finalize its recommendations, we
should all pay close attention.

Washington and Lee has long
been enamored with ‘‘the single
sanction.”’

Yet, this single sanction seems to
be danced around with frightening
regularity on matters not strictly
concerning the White Book.

New date set for Lenfest

 

By Chris Bray
Staff Reporter

 

The Lenfest Center, Washington
and Lee’s new center for the per-
forming arts, should be ready for
occupancy by Oct. 23, according to
the University’s Coordinator of Capi-
tal Planning Frank Parsons.

Barring further delay, the Drama
Department will occupy the building
by November, giving the department
time to prepare for its first production
of the year, Skin of Our Teeth by
Thornton Wilder. The production
will open in the Lenfest Center Jan.
18, 1991.

Although the Lenfest Center will
be ready for the Drama Department
soon, Parsons said that a familiar
problem to W&L construction work
may delay completion of the struc-

ture.

‘The ‘curse of the gatehouse’ has
hit W&L again,’’ said Parsons. ‘‘In
the Lenfest Center, as was the case
in Gaines Hall, the gatehouse will be
the last part of the building to be
completed.”’

Parsons said completion of the
gatehouse, which will be ready by the
first production, will have no effect
on the occupancy of the building.
The Gaines Hall gatehouse was fi-
nished while students resided in the
dorm.

Originally scheduled to open by
April of this year, the Lenfest Center
has fallen victim to the usual delays
encountered on a construction site,
according to Parsons.

Initial delays stemmed from a
combination of the Bass Construction
Company’s underestimation of con-
struction time and site problems such

as rock excavation that arose during
early construction. In the Univer-
sity’s contract with Bass, site
problems permit delays in the com-
pletion of the Center, said Parsons.
As a result of these delays, August
31, 1990, was set as the new date of
completion.

The most recent delay, however,
sets the completion date at Oct. 23,
and results from a request from Bass
for an additional 35 working days to
make up construction time lost during
the winter due to inclement weather.

Construction of the $9.8 million
project began in the summer of 1988
after the school received a $3 million
donation earmarked for the fine arts
center fom Mr. and Mrs. Gerry Len-
fest of Huntingdon Valley, Pennsyl-
vania. Lenfest is a 1954 graduate of
W&L.

The Ring-tum Phi, September 6, 1990

 

Howison

from page 2

 

perhaps some special efforts to recruit minority
students?

HOWISON: One of the principles of a liberal
arts education is that you’re exposed to new ideas.
Outside the classroom there also should be oppor-
junities to have your ideas challenged. So, for
example, your roommate happens to be from
Alaska. That brings a little different perspective.

The bottom line here is qualified. I wouldn’t
compromise the standards in any way...[but] yes, I
do believe the university should continue to look
at ways to bring in diverse people.

PHI: Do you think W&L should concentrate on
making an extra effort to recruit minority
professors to come to campus and teach?

HOWISON: To me, that is a much more
difficult issue than the issue of recruiting minority
students. The reason is that, over the last ten years,

_the number of, we'll focus on blacks in this case,
“who are completing their doctorates has declined,
so the pool of available people is relatively small.
“So, when Washington and Lee says should we
attempt to bring in qualified minority teachers--
“absolutely. But we've got to realistic about it, it’s
‘very difficult.

I do think the university has to use its
resources in a reasonable way to find ways to
diversify the environment, and getting a first-rate
teacher with a different perspective is one way to
do it. But we should not kid ourselves, this is a
very difficult and tough process.

PHI: W&L has a number of "senior" faculty
members. As they retire, do you think there’s
going to be a shortage of professors in the
upcoming years, and do you think the quality of
the faculty is going to be affected?

HOWISON: That's a very significant concern
because the national market for outstanding
teachers is declining at the time that there is this
significant number reaching retirement age.

The difficulty with Washington and Lee is that
even though we are extraordinarily strong, we are
going to be competing with the finest schools in
America for these teachers, and that’s the key: we
want the best teachers possible. I am confident we
can do it, but it’s not going to be easy. It is vital
to find the people that would find Washington and
Lee and Lexington an attractive community.

PHI: Since you really haven’t had a chance to
meet with the whole student body, if you could tell

them something as a group, what would you like
it to be?

HOWISON: First of all, I’m honored to be
here as the dean and I couldn’t be happier. I see
my role as being a facilitator to achieve the goals
of Washington and Lee, and that’s the key thing
for me.

At all times when there are tough issues and
we have differences of opinion, what I try to do is
come back and say “what are the fundamental
purposes of this university?", so that whatever
we're doing we're not compromising those in any
way.

"hes I see myself as being here 24 hours a
day, 365 days a year, right on campus, and I look
forward to individual contact so that students feel
welcome to walk in here. I have an open door
policy. I also will plan to have what I call an
auxiliary office where a couple of times a semester
I just set up my office on a table out on the
campus somewhere and the people will just walk
by and see me.

Let me try to tie it together: commitment to the
university and personal accessibility. Those are the
main messages.

Wé&L alums head
to Persian Gulf

 

By John Laney
Staff Reporter

 

At least six Washington and
Lee alumni are amid the military
buildup in the Persian Gulf, ac-
cording to W&L’s Military Sci-
ence Department and the Alumni
Office.

Three alumni are part of Oper-
ation Desert Shield, now the larg-
est U.S. military mobilization since
D-Day in World War II. The
other three reside and work in
Saudi Arabia.

Second Lt. Jon D. Missert ’88,
2nd Lt. Clifford Deal ’88 and 1st
Lt. Arthur A. Kandarian ’86 are
part of the 82nd Airborne Divi-
sion, the first unit that went to
Saudi Arabia.

cencaaamaacercascmcnmanal

Missert and Kandarian were
also in Panama in December as
part of Operation Just Cause.

Lt. Col. Joel J. Snow, W&L
professor of military science, said
that other W&L graduates may be
stationed in the Persian Gulf at
this time, but he docs not yet
know who they are.

Snow also said that any cor-
respondence to these three soldiers
would be appreciated. Their ad-
dresses can be obtained from the
military science department.

The W&L Alumni Office listed
three alumni with addresses in
Saudi Arabia. The list said that
Robert A. Cashill ’68, an industrial
engineer, and Ellen Westbrook
*89L live in Dhahran, while
Norton L. Wisdom, Jr. °59, an
architect, lives in Tobuk.

Women’s soccer enters tell-tale year

 

From W&L Sports Information

In three years of guiding varsity
women’s soccer, head coach Janine
Hathom has seen marked improve-
ment with each passing season. Each
campaign has brought new highs, and
with those highs have come new
expectations and new challenges.

In 1990, the expectations again
have risen, and Hathorn says the
struggle now is particularly important.

Hathorn sees 1990 as the water-
mark year for W&L women’s soccer.
While the Generals have gotten them-
selves in position to contend for the
ODAC crown, getting there and doing
so are two different things. Four
veteran starters, including two gritty
defenders and W&L’s all-time leading

, Scorer, have been lost to graduation.

Hathorn will have to mix the old
carefully with the new to get the
right formula for success. So far, the
strides have been gradual, but pro-
gressive. Her team finished fourth in
the 1988 ODAC standings and
reached the ODAC semifinals with an
upset of Roanoke in 1989.

One of the permanent parts of the
W&L soccer program is talent. Hath-
om has plenty of that commodity
returning. Nineteen letterwinners from
last year’s 6-9-3 squad return, includ-
ing seven starters and four of last
year’s six goal-scorers.

Heading the list of returnees is
two-time All-ODAC honoree Nancy
Mitchell, the junior who is the guts
of the W&L defense. Joining Mitchell
on the defensive end is two-year
letterwinner Ashley Hurt.

Also gone is two year starter in

The Ring-tum Phi, September 6, 1990

goal Sherri Brown. Her 12 carcer
shutouts and experience will be sorely
missed, but talented freshmen Sarah
Butler and Katie Stimeling will look
to make it as tough if not tougher on
opposing offenses to score.

So it appears there will not be too
much of a problem with defense. The
same cannot be said for the W&L
scoring punch. Only two players who
scored more than one goal last year
are back. Sophomore Andrea Carda-
mone, who led W&L in scoring with
five goals and two assists and junior
Ann Shaughnessy, who had two
goals, are the Icading returning scor-
ers.

Goal production was a problem in
89. The Generals were shut out
themselves 11 times. Hathorn hopes
some of the problem might be allevi-
ated by the healthy return of junior

W&L faces QB questions

 

« By Jay Plotkin

j Sports Editor

* In 1989, the Washington and Lee
passing attack was deadly for oppo-
nents. Over the course of the season,

s head coach Gary Fallon’s offense
either tied or set 26 school records as

"a direct result of passing the ball.

The entire offensive line returns,
as do a host of experienced, young

' players, so it would be fair to say

« that the future looks bright for W&L.

But inspite of the experienced

" players returning, Fallon still has one

« simple question to answer. But this
question has a not so simple answer.

' Who will direct the team on offense?

Gone from the 1989 team are
record setting quarterbacks Phillip

‘ Sampson and Chris Smythe. In their

. stead stand juniors George Sakin and
Fred Renneker and sophomore Darren

‘Johnson. None of the trio have

. thrown a pass in a college game, and
only Sakin has taken a snap. Ren-

‘ neker was a defensive back last sea-

- son, and Johnson lent his 6-5 frame
to the basketball team.

‘ — Sakin will be the starting quarter-

+ back on Saturday when the Generals
take the field against Emory and

‘Henry, but if he is unable to-move

+ the team, Fallon won’t waste any

, time going to Renneker and Johnson. _

The quarterbacks should have
plenty of time to pick out a host of
more than capable receivers, led by
pre-season first team All-American
Craig Irons, who is just 45 catches
shy of the W&L career record.

Four Generals should handle the
rushing chores in 1990. Two time
leading rusher senior Mason Pope
will handle the bulk of the load.
Spelling him will be the tandem of
senior Kirk Sohonage and sophomore
Wade Robinett. Sohonage and sopho-
more Mark Goglia will take turns at
fullback leading the way for the tail-
backs.

Paving the way for the offense
will be a five-man front that averages
6-2, 237 pounds. Senior preseason
All-American Rob Roberton will look
to rebound from a preseason hamstr-
ing injury to anchor one side of the
line at tackle along with classmate
Rob Christensen at guard. Senior
Frank Sudell will again handle the
snapping duties, and juniors Rob
Thomas and Jim Henry will anchor
the other side of the line.

Defensively, the Generals are
young, experienced and ready to take
on the world. Back to bolster the
defensive line are junior middle guard
Greg Kiehl, sophomore tackle Phil
Spears and junior ends John Mc-
Callum and Scott Williamson.

At linebacker, junior Trey Cox

will get lots of help trying to fill the
shoes of the graduated Mike Pack.
Sophomores Paul Mallos and Lyle
Smith will play large roles immedi-
ately, as will newcomer Evans Ed-
wards.

In the secondary, juniors Doug
Lefevre and David Frankhouser will
be hard pressed to replace Warren
and Rimmer, both all-Old Dominion
Athletic Conference players. They
will join the experienced duo of
Clark Wight and Brad Miller, who
occupy the safety positions. Also
seeing time in the secondary will be
sophomore Donald Dempsey and
newcomers Tom Mandia and Bill
Harker.

Renneker, says Fallon, might see
time in the secondary while also
occupying the second-string quarter-
back position.

The questions remain for the Gen-
erals. Can Sakin or Renneker or
Johnson move the team and keep the
ball in the capable hands of Irons?
Will the young defense mature quick
enough to bail out the offense should
it falter? Will Fallon’s love affair
with the passing game continue in
1990?

All questions will be answered on
Saturday against Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference favorite Emory arid”

Henry. Game time is 1:30 on Wilson
Field.

scorers Ashley Gray and Morgan
Warner, both of whom were slowed
by injury last year. Gray, a 15-game
Starter as a freshman, had four goals
and four assists in her first year,
while Warner, who also started 15
games in '88, had a pair of goals her
freshman season.

Hathorn hopes the scoring will
come. She has faith in her team’s
work ethic, and she says that will
help her players reach their goals.

“IT think we’ve got some good
leadership, players who lead by ex-
ample,’’ she said. ‘‘We will be a
little more intense, make more sacri-
fices. I like the mindset of these
women. They're aware of where they
are and where they can go, and

ment.’’

Volleyball set to spike
conference opponents

 

From W&L Sports Information

 

Washington and Lee volleyball
head coach Susan Dittman is tired of
hearing how well her teams have
done despite the relative youth of the
volleyball program.

In just their third season of Old
Dominion Athletic Conference play,
the Generals and their coach are
eyeing a shot at the league title, a
crown that has been captured by only
one of two schools in ODAC history.
But Dittman sees it as a pretty logi-
cal next step in the development of
the W&L program.

Six of last year’s top seven per-
formers return, including All-ODAC
first team playmaker Lisa Jay and
All-ODAC second team hitter Mena
McGowin. The senior-junior duo were
a large part of why W&L averaged
over eight kills per game last year.

Jay has been the mainstay of the
W&L program since her arrival, and
1990 figures to be no different. Jay
accounted for over 80 percent of
W&L’s assists last year, and she will
direct the W&L attack. Jay also had
13 block points, which was fourth
best on the team, and she served at a

.922 clip.

Jay obviously can’t do it all by
herself, and in 1990 she'll have a
proven stable to fuel her attack. Mc-
Gowin’s 214 kills led the team last
year, and the 5-10 junior figures to
be the go-to gal again this season.
But she will have company. Leslie
Hess is coming off a fantastic fresh-
man season in which she was third
on the team in kills, first in digs, and
fifth in block points.

Other returning players who
should bolster the W&L attack in-
clude junior Rashmi Sachan and
sophomore Liz Randol. Sachan
saw action in 68 games and had 32
kills and 15 block points last year.
Randol had 17 kills and a healthy
-172 attack percentage in '89. ;

With all those positives, it’s hard
not to think the Generals should be a
shoe-in for the conference finals. But
Dittman knows there are too many
intangibles along the way for her to
start making reservations for the
championship match.

With a supply of veterans and an
impressive group of youngsters nip-
ping at their heels, there’s no reason
not to think big.

Men look to retain title

 

From W&L Sports Information

The Washington and Lee men’s
soccer program put together one of
the most impressive finishing runs in
school history with last year’s 10-5-
2 campaign. W&L closed the, season
with six consecutive victories, the
Old Dominion Athietic Conference
Championship and a victory over
cross-town rival VMI.

With 17 lettermen and a host of
starters returning from that cham-
pionship season, it would be fair to
say the Generals are already on their
way to defending that ODAC title.
Indeed the other coaches in the
NCAA Division III South Region.
They picked the Generals tenth in the
preseason poll.

There’s no question about the
talent at W&L for 1990. Three all-
«conference players return to the Gen-

erals’ lineup this year. All-ODAC

first-teamer Mike Mitchem led W&L
in assists with nine and tacked on
five goals to place him second in the
conference scoring race. The Gener-
als also will benefit from the return
of All-ODAC second-teamers Greg
Williams, a defensive stalwart, and
Reid Murphy, a versatile player who
combined three goals with tenacious
defensive play last year.

And defense is where the defend-
ing ODAC champs will start. W&L
allowed more than two goals in just
four contests last year, while shutting
out five opponents in posting a team
goals against average of 1.5.

Another vital contributor is senior
goalie Jon Bull, a seven-game starter
in 1989. Bull led the Generals in
minutes played (715) and saves (58)
and had a 1.51 goals against average
last year.

Head coach Rolf Piranian says the
goalkeeping will have to be more
