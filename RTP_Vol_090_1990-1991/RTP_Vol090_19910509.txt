W&L community, alumni prepare for big weekend

 

By Alisha Johnson

+ Staff Reporter

 

Over 700 Washington and Lee University

* alumni will return to their alma mater this
, weekend to celebrate undergraduate and law

class reunions.

’ A slate of activities have been prepared in

honor of the classes of 1941, 1946, 1951,
1956, 1961, 1966, 1971, 1976, 1981 and

* 1986.

‘*The single most important weekend here
at W&L is Reunion Weekend,’’ said Assistant
‘*We have
50 non-reunionists who are coming back to
see the campus. This reunion will target

* particularly the Class of °'41, who are

celebrating their 50th reunion, and of ’66,
who will be here for their 25th reunion.’’

Mish said the university also invited the
alumni who were in the Persian Gulf to
Participate in the weekend as W&L guests.
They will be recognized at the joint meeting
of the W&L Alumni and Law associations.

The weekend activities began today with
the meeting of the 20-member Alumni Board
of Directors and the opening reunion
assembly in Lee Chapel.

According to W&L Alumni Director
James Farrar, the Alumni Board meeting will
serve as an ‘‘update session’ in which
University President John Wilson will
comment on the state of the university.

The board, which serves as a mouthpiece
for 17,000-18,000 alumni, focuses on interests
such as alumni career assistance, alumni
admissions programs, alumni chapter events,
and the Alumni Athlete Hall of Fame.

In addition to board meetings, interested

alumni and their guests can attend one of two
panel discussions offered Friday.

From 10:30 a.m. to noon ‘Understanding
the Muslim Attitude toward the West’’ will
be held in Lenfest, led by W&L professors.
In Lee Chapel W&L history professors will
present a discussion on ‘‘Robert E. Lee:
Soldier and Educator.’’

‘The idea of bringing the alumni back to
attend panel discussions is to give them the
feeling of being back in classes as well as to
give them an opportunity to socialize,’’ Mish
said. ‘Intellectual stimulation and socializing
have always gone together at W&L.”’

Following a luncheon on the Front Lawn,
there will be a panel discussion on ‘‘W&L
Today: Presentations/Questions and Answers’”’
in the Lenfest Center with several deans.

‘“T think the alumni will be able to see
how W&L has changed over the years and

yet how it has stayed the same,’’ Mish said.
‘*We’d like students to be around so that the
alumni can see how the university is now.”’

Cocktails with the faculty will be served
to alumni at the Alumni House in honor of
professors retiring at this year-end.

Mish encouraged all students to attend the
third annual concert of the Alumni/Glee Club
performance in the Keller Theatre of the
Lenfest Center Saturday morning at 11:30.

Book-signing by Tom Wolfe, °51, has
been added to Saturday afternoon’s schedule,
for 1-3 p.m. in the University Bookstore.

Mish, who celebrates his 15th reunion this
weekend, said the 1991 Alumni Weekend is
the first major event he has organized since
his arrival on campus in July.

“One of the changes this year is that
there will be a band that plays anything from
Glenn Miller to Beach Boys to Motown,”’

» After three controversial years, the
university is reevaluating the Con-
‘fidential Review Committee, and
«might make significant changes in its
operation as early as next fall.

* In connection with that review,
,Dean of Students David Howison
went to the Executive Committee
«Meeting Monday to hear the mem- |
bers’ opinions about possible changes.
* “Tt was a very productive meet-
ing,’ Howison said. ‘‘It’s very im-

Howison denied that the reevalua-

‘tion was related to recent criticism of
,the university’s Harassment Policy,
which the CRC enforces.

+ ‘The faculty had planned for a
review of the CRC back when it was
“first initiated,’’ Howison said. ‘I’m
sure there is an impression that we’re
doing this because of what’s been

After one year of embarrassing
delays, the Fraternity Renaissance
Program seems to have finally found
its stride.

Phase I of Renaissance is almost
complete, and Phases II and III are
in excellent condition, ‘according to
Frank A. Parsons, coordinator of
capital planning.

Part of the reason for this im-
provement is the University’s new
policy of allowing several contractors
to bid competitively for the work on
each house.

Bass Construction, which built the
University Library in 1974 and has
worked on several projects for the
university since then, had a contract
for all the Phase I houses.

Parsons said Bass had been on
time and performed excellently in all
its projects prior to Phase I.

’ “Bass failed to perform, both at
the Lenfest Center and [on the Phase
I houses],’’ Parsons said. ‘‘This was
uncharacteristic of them."

The final two Phase I houses,
Beta Theta Pi and Phi Kappa Sigma,
may be able to use the party areas of
their houses for Alumni Weekend,
Parsons said.

Parsons said the Beta house is
“essentially complete.

“Once [Beta’s] house corporation
makes arrangements with [the univer-
sity treasurer], I think they can have
access to the common areas of the
house, particularly to the party area,”’
Parsons said.

Beta President Kevin Bauer, said
the fraternity is anxious to unveil the
house for Alumni Weekend, but will
not know if it will be available until
Thursday or Friday.

“Tt’s still a little bit up in the air,
but I hope we can use [the house],’’
Bauer said.

While construction on the Phi Kap
house is about two weeks behind
Beta, Parsons said the Lexington
building inspector will inspect the Phi
Kap basement Friday. Parsons said
the fraternity might then also be able
to use its party area this weekend.

Phi Kap President Marc Short said
he would like to show off the new
house for returning alumni.

“The University has put a lot of
money into [the house], and I know
the alumni want to see it,’ Short
said.

Parsons said Beta and Phi Kap
will move into their houses in Sep-
tember 1991, completing Phase I nine
months behind schedule.

In contrast, Phase II, which in-
cludes Lambda Chi Alpha, Kappa
Sigma, Pi Kappa Phi, and Phi Kappa
Psi, is progressing quvickly and
smoothly, Parsons said.

Parsons said the contractors work-
ing on the Lambda Chi house and the
old Zeta Beta Tau house [which
Kappa Sigma will occupy] ‘‘have
been very quick in moving the job
along.

‘The progress [on Kappa Sigma]
is very good, and at Lambda Chi, the
progress is even better,’’ Parsons
said.

The Interfraternity Council Judicial Board
punished three fraternities Tuesday with social
probation for breaking an IFC bylaw by par-
tying together.

Chi Psi, Delta Tau Delta and Phi Gamma
Delta will begin one week of social probation
Tuesday. The board found them guilty of
violating an IFC bylaw that forbids more than
two fraternities from cosponsoring a party in a
chapter house.

The three houses cosponsored the ‘‘Sher-
man’s March to the Sea’’ party at Chi Psi
Friday night.

Social chairmen from the three houses all
said they were surprised by the judicial action,
and all said they had been unaware of the IFC
bylaw. Chi Psi Social Chairman Kevin Fliess
was especially surprised, because he registered
the party in advance with the IFC under the
three houses’ names.

According to Associate Dean of Students
Leroy ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins, an IFC officer usually
does not review the party registration forms
until after the parties occur.

“It would have saved us a week of social
probation’’ if the IFC had reviewed the forms
in advance and warned of the potential viola-
tion, Fliess said.

Atkins said the party registration form
includes a statement that the signatory is famil-

iar with applicable IFC rules.

“T think it’s been a while since a lot of the
rules have been enforced,’’ Atkins said, ‘‘be-
cause people are so slack about reading the
book.”’

The IFC constitution and bylaws are printed
in the Student Handbook.

According to the bylaws, the three-house
party rule exists ‘‘because no member of the
Council has a house large enough to accom-
modate more than two chapters.’’ The bylaws
also state that at most, fraternity members, their
dates, and ‘‘specifically invited guests’’ can
attend parties.

Chi Psi, Delt and Fiji have about 121
members combined, according to figures pro-
vided by their officers.

Fliess said that at the peak of Friday night’s
party there were about 500 people present. He
said the house was ‘‘near capacity,’’ but ‘‘you
could still move around.”’

Delt 1990-91 Social Chairman Richard
Martz said he disagrees with the three-house
party rule.

Three smaller houses together could amount
to a smaller party than the two largest houses
combined, Martz said.

Fliess agreed and said the criteria should
therefore be changed.

‘*If the idea is to limit numbers, they need
to do something else,’’ Fliess said. ‘At almost
any party on campus there could be a greater
number of people.’’

OPINION
CRC going,
going...

The Executive Committee had a lengthy and productive
discussion with Dean Howison Monday, and _ the
representatives freely aired their views on the CRC. Howison
was very receptive to the EC’s input, but the
recommendations the EC made are only the beginning of the
demise of a committee with no jurisdiction of its own, and
therefore no purpose.

The EC sought greater control over the CRC through the
power to appoint the student CRC members, a power the EC
wants and should have. President Wilson’s current
appointment power in that regard stands only as an insult to
student autonomy, a snub to the EC.

The most important EC recommendation, however, one
with which Howison agreed, was that the CRC should be
limited to sexual assault cases.

But take that argument a step further. No EC member
raised the point that such cases are already handled in
another jurisdiction: the law.

In a case several years ago, the EC learned the hard way
that its confidentiality must be breached if an honor
violation might simultaneously be a crime; it cannot remain
secret from the police until the honor hearings are over.
Likewise, the CRC had best remember that any matter it
deals with that might be a crime should be referred to police
without delay. The law will handle the situation thenceforth.

But then what of the CRC? If the law finds the accused
innocent, does the CRC claim the right to try with a lower
standard of proof to determine guilt? And if the law finds
the accused guilty, but the accused remains enrolled, is
sexual assault not an honor violation to be dealt with by the
EC?

Stripping the CRC to handling sexual assault cases only
is a move in the right direction, but the case in which the
CRC might rightfully handle an incident of sexual assault
outside the law and outside the Honor System eludes
imagination.

No delivery

We tried and tried, but delivery of the Phi to fraternities ©

just does not work and is discontinued as of this issue.

Apparently, very few fraternity members eat in their
house, on time at least. It seems that most are so anxious to
get the Phi, they stop by the University Center and pick up
the issues intended for freshmen, independents and women
— despite a sign asking you not to last week.

We find ourselves each week with a shortage of Phis
with the current system of distribution. In an attempt to
alleviate this problem we have increased the number of
copies printed to the maximum our budget will allow, and
we will now put all copies in front of the GHQ which are
not scheduled for delivery to administration, faculty and
subscribers.

Come get your own Phis, but if you are getting them for
your whole house, only take as many copies as you will use
(count them as some weeks the paper is thin and a small
handful can be well over 100 copies), and be sure that only
one member of your house comes to pick up papers for
everyone.

Quotes of the week

The same type of perception held by many students about the
CRC is held by many of the Executive Committee: that we're
fascists and we're Nazis.

— 1989-90 EC President and 1990-91 senior EC Rep.
Willard Dumas

Murph’s replacement has a lot of innovative ideas to bring
to this school, which should make a lot of us anti-innovative
people nervous.

Charles Kranich and Tim Molloy have unfairly por-
trayed the American Civil Liberties Union as an ideologi-
cally extreme organization. The ACLU is not ‘‘on the
fringe’’ of traditional American values, as Kranich
asserted in his My View column, nor is it comparable to
the Communists or the Moral Majority, as Tim Molloy
portrayed in his Ring-tum Phi cartoon. The ACLU’s sole
objective is to defend and maintain freedoms and civil
liberties guaranteed in the Bill of Rights. What could be
more American or patriotic than that? Accusing us of
taking the Bill of Rights to extremes is, in effect, voicing
a more fundamental complaint about the Constitution and
some of the most deeply held values in our society.

When George Bush attacked Michael Dukakis as a
“‘card-carrying member of the ACLU,’’ his attack was

successful because Dukakis failed to respond.

However, had he defended himself by identifying the
aims of the ACLU, Bush’s attack might have been
exposed as the shallow fear tactic that it was. After all,
who are the true patriots, those who wrap themselves in
the American flag or those who wrap themselves in what
the flag represents?

Due to limited space, I will only be able to respond
to the two most misleading attacks made by Kranich.

was that the ACLU ‘maintains that even metal

detectors should be removed from airports on constitu-
tional grounds.’’ Actually, this statement is outright false.
What we do oppose are ‘‘drug courier profiles’? which
allow police and airport security guards to stop people
based solely on their look, rather than on objective
evidence. When personal appearance is allowed as a basis
to stop and search, discrimination results.

Kranich also complains that we challenge the tax-
exempt status of churches. While this statement is true,
it has the effect of making us seem anti-religious. Like
Thomas Jefferson, we think that ‘‘wall of separation’’
between church and state benefits both entities. When the
wall is breached, religious institutions become dependent
on the government for approval and financial support.
With a financial incentive like tax exemption, the govern-
ment is clearly encouraging the formation and growth of
religion, just as it encourages financial growth with tax
breaks for big investors.

Our country was founded on two great principles
which, in our founding fathers’ time, were considered
unprecedented. One was the principle of democracy:
people ought to be able to vote for their governing
representatives, and that the majority should govern most
political decisions. This idea has become pretty well
entrenched in our country. The other was the principle of
liberty. This is the idea that, even in a democracy, the
majority doesn’t get to rule everything. There are certain
individual rights that protect the few from the tyranny of
the many. This principle is a fragile one and it is the
principle that the ACLU was founded to protect.

ACLU sponsors non-partisan events

 

MY VIEW
By Matt Jackson

 

I am not a member of the Washington and Lee
Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union; I
do not agree with some of the ACLU’s national
agenda and as a result, I do not want to pay a $5
membership fee to benefit the national assemblage.
But when considering the microcosmic agenda for
the W&L chapter, my sympathies naturally change.

The Washington and Lee chapter, to the best of
my knowledge, has sponsored two speakers on
campus and has coordinated a non-partisan ‘‘Spe-
ak-out’’ (a type of open debate). The chapter’s
accomplishments this year can only be classified as
heightening intellectual and political awareness on
campus. What’s wrong with that? The Executive
Committee evidently found nothing wrong with the

Sbar wanna

THE BIZARRE SIDE
By Tom Hespos

 

 

Okay, so maybe this isn’t easy. It’s kind of
tough to take the place of a person considered a
legend in his own time. As I began to tell my
friends that I wanted to write humor for the Phi,
their reaction 90 percent of the time was, ‘‘Tom,
don’t kid yourself. You’re not nearly as funny as
that Sbar guy. You're just an obnoxious New
Yorker. Go back to the frat house and have a
beer."’

It’s so nice to know that one’s friends can be
sO supportive in the face of impending doom. Sup-
pose I’m really not funny. Suppose I am only an
obnoxious New Yorker...

The label ‘‘obnoxious New Yorker’’ is one that
I have learned to live with since my arrival last
fall. I’ve been told that my style of dress, and
even my hairstyle, is obnoxious. The great-grand-
daddy of all insults, however, came last week du-
ring a game of foosball, when one of my pledge
brothers nonchalantly said:

“Tom, your car is really obnoxious!”’

Obviously, this resident of South Carolina was
unaware that insulting a New Yorker's car is like
looking death square in the face. Besides being a
reflection of my personality and personal philoso-
phy, my car represents thousands upon thousands
of man-hours of body work, engine work, and
transmission work. In fact, the last guy who
insulted my car is currently rotting in my trunk.
Since coming to W&L, however, I have mellowed
out considerably. Thus, I managed to take the
criticism at face value:

‘“‘What do you mean my car is obnoxious,
you scrawny, anorexic lightweight?’’

My brothers who were present began to name
several things that they consider obnoxious about
my car; things that simply blend right in at home.
I remembered most of these things, and I will

chapter’s local agenda, since it agreed to fund a
modest $30 to help pay for the Speak-out.

The Speak-out was an interesting, balanced
debate concerning the law school’s former policy
of preventing the armed forces from recruiting on
campus. The debate eventually ended up as a dis-
cussion over whether or not homosexuals should be
allowed to serve in the military. The event seemed
to be enjoyed by the more than 30 students and
faculty members in attendance. A great deal of
audience participation resulted, and the event was
totally positive. The chapter did not push an
ideological agenda; instead, it emphasized free
speech and open debate. The whole event was
educationally enriching and entertaining. Willard
Dumas, John Fialcowitz, Tom Hatcher, Giles
Perkins, Dan Munroe, Caroline Wight, and Ashby
Hackney, the EC members who voted in favor of
granting the $30 to the chapter, should be com-
mended for their wise decision that made the
Speak-out possible and enriched W&L’s intellectu-

al climate that day.

However, when the chapter requested additional
funding the following week to help pay for another
Speak-out and another speaker, the EC rejected the
request.

The chapter did not deserve to be rejected.
After all, the chapter planned to handle the second
Speak-out just like the first one. The audience
would have enjoyed a well-conceived, well-bal-
anced debate. If there were no complaints about
the first Speak-out, why did the majority of the
EC members reverse their decision concerning the
second Speak-out? Willard Dumas and John Fial-
cowitz, it should be noted, were the only EC
members who voted in favor of funding the chapter
both times. Their votes, unlike many of the others,
reflect a consistent belief that Washington and Lee
would benefit from a heightened intellectual and
political awareness. It is too bad that more EC
members do not share that noble consistent, belief.
Our campus would be better off if they did.

Top Ten Obnoxious Things

About Tom's Car

10. Cheesy door reflectors bought for $1.99 at
local AID auto store.
9. Pinstriping with extra-cheesy lightning bolt
graphics on rear quarter-panels.
8. Windshield washers installed in grille to fire
forward at the touch of a button.
7. Louisville Slugger in back seat to discourage
those more obnoxious than I.
6. Really loud stereo that is worth more than blue-
book value of the car.
5. Penthouse air freshener hanging from rear-view
mirror.
4. Ultra-cheesy surfing decals and bumper stickers
covering entire rear end.
3. Sticks of dynamite in glove compartment to
discourage tailgaters. (Relax, Officer Clark, I’m
only kidding.)
2. Radar detector on dash, protesting the ban on
such devices in Virginia. This risks a $500 fine,
but as long as I have explosives in my glove
compartment...
1. Big dent on passenger side from fishtailing into
a large canine on I-95. (Sbar may like large dogs,
but they tend to make me ill.)

Okay, my car may be obnoxious, but I made it
that way. In the words of one female freshman
from California, ‘‘Tom, your car is sooo0000
Guido.”

That’s another thing that irks me. The general
populace assumes that Long Island, my place of
origin, is an extension of New York City, inhab-
ited exclusively by drug addicts and members of
the Mafia. You wouldn’t believe the reaction I get
when I tell people that I live in the suburbs, I’m
drug-free, and my last name isn’t Corleone. I'm
not even Italian.

Granted, New York City is a place of extreme
violence and human suffering, but to write off an
entire state because of the actions of only a few
million psychos is wrong.

People here get so freaked out when they hear
some of the things New Yorkers do for fun. We
don’t do such asinine things as cow-tipping or
flagpole-swinging. Illegal drag-racing, shoplifting,
and arson, however, are quite popular. Some New
Yorkers go as far as to idolize the New Kids on
the Block, not for their musical ability, but for
their ability to burn down motels. Even the way
we order pizza in New York offends people. Let
me explain:

How to Order Pizza in New York
1. Call Domino’s.
2. Order 15 large pepperoni pies.
3. Have it delivered to a house down the block.
4. Wait in bushes for delivery person.
5. When he arrives, beat him to within an inch of
his life.
6. Take pizza home to the family.
7. Read about your escapade in the newspaper the
next morning.

I kid you not, this actually happened in my
home town several times. Since then, Domino's
requires that you have a pistol permit to apply for
a position. Please don’t try it in Lexington, as it
will probably get you into trouble with either
Officer Clark and his infamous turbo golf cart, or
one of those silly committees like the CRC.

I realize that I haven’t exactly promoted tour-
ism in my home -state with this article. I have
heard some people say, ‘‘New York is a great
place to live, but I sure wouldn’t want to visit.’’
My advice to W&L students and faculty: Relax,
take a valium, and learn to tolerate New Yorkers.
Eventually, some will learn to conform and wear
Duck Heads and $75 Ray-Bans. Until then, please
be tolerant.

Ed. note: The search continues. This column is the
first applicant to replace The Sbar Side. How do
you like it? Think you can do better? If you would

like the chance, submit an attempt to the Phj
mailbox on level two in the University Center.

George
readies
for repair

By Tom Eisenhauer
Staff Reporter

 

Old George, a 700-pound replica
of George Washington, will be absent
from his perch atop Washington Hall
longer than expected.

The statue of George Washing-
ton, affectionately called Old George,
will not return to Washington and
Lee until early 1992, according to
James W. Whitehead, director of the
Reeves Center.

Old George was removed from
Washington Hall on April 17, 1990,
for restoration and replication.

Whitehead, who is overseeing the
restoration, said the delay is due to
the eight months the wooden statue
needed to dry out. Branko Medenica,
a Birmingham, Ala., sculptor, could
only then begin restoration.

After Medenica finishes, a replica
of Old George will be cast in bronze
in a foundry in Florida, Whitehead
said. The bronze replica will be
painted white and placed atop Wash-
ington Hall. The original George will
receive a place of honor inside a
university building.

The statue, which stands eight feet
tall, originally carved by local
carpenter Matthew Kahle in 1840
from a pine log he found drifting
down the James River. According to
legend the university bought Old
George from Kahle for $100.

Since that time Old George has
become a widely recognized member
of the campus and a symbol of the
university. George has also been
painted colors other than his usual
white many times by pranksters and
dressed up for many _ university
activities such as Fancy Dress.

The estimated $100,000 needed to
restore Old George is being contrib-
uted by W&L’s Class of 1940, said
Director of Communications Brian
Shaw when the statue was removed.

Parsons said five or six contrac-
tors, including Bass, bid on the Kap-
pa Sigma and Lambda Chi houses.
J.B. Wine & Son, Inc., Staunton, Va.,
won the Kappa Sigma job; Lantz
Construction, Broadway, Va., won the
Lambda Chi job; and H. Hamner Gay
& Company, Inc., Lynchburg, Va.,
was the low bidder on the Davidson
Park joo.

Parsons said all three contractors
are doing excellent work.

“They're performing quite well,
and the price was very attractive,’’
Parsons said.

Parsons said the Lambda Chi and
Kappa Sigma houses will be complete
by January 1992.

The university will receive bids
for the last two houses in Phase II,
Pi Phi and Phi Psi, later this month,
Parsons said. Phi Psi will be com-
plete by January 1992 and Pi Phi by

September 1992.

Phase III of the program will
include the construction of new hou-
ses for Sigma Chi and Sigma Phi Ep-
silon in Davidson Park.

Parsons said renovation of the
present Sigma Chi house would be
too expensive because of its small
size.

Renovating the present SPE house,
on the other hand, poses different
problems, Parsons said.

The SPE house ‘‘is a very large
house and would be a very, very
expensive renovation,’’ Parsons said.
‘‘Additionally, the house itself is not
considered a part of our campus.”’

The last houses to undergo reno-
vation will be Delta Tau Delta and
Kappa Alpha. Parsons said both will
be complete by September 1992.

“By January 1993, we should be
all done,’’ Parsons said.

Pi Beta Phi might be the next
sorority to colonize at Washington &

told council members Tuesday. The
PHC extended an informal bid
sorority Tuesday afternoon wher
Wyatt called the national office and
expressed the university’s interest in
seeing their colonization here

‘‘They were surprised to receive
the call, but said that they had seen
some of the recent Ring-tum Phi
articles and knew their name was
being discussed,’’ Wyatt said

The bid was extended after the
Student Affairs Committee
unanimously voted Friday that an
extension was vital to the sororities
already in existence despiti
Delta Gamma’s unsuccessful coloniza
tion attempt earlier this year.

‘*We want to make sure that what
happened to DG doesn’t happen
again, but at the same time we do
need another group on campus,
Associate Dean of Students Leroy
‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins said. ‘‘Our chapters

here are just too big. We are striving
for houses of 75 or 80 girls, and
right now they are well over 100.”’

Since both Chi Omega and Kappa
Kappa Gamma sororities initiated
their largest pledge classes last week-

nd, each of the three sororities has
»ver 110 members.

Dean of Students David Howison
and the PHC are also in favor of an
extension in the near future.

‘Everyone has evaluated DG’s
situation, and hopefully we can learn
from the past,’’ Howison said. ‘‘We
all want another sorority to succeed
here. Even the three sorority presi-
dents want another sorority to suc-
ceed, and we hope it will be Pi Beta
Phi.”’

Pi Beta Phi officials seem opti-
mistic, but will not respond to the
bid until their national officers meet
ind discuss the proposal. They re-
quested that the three sorority presi-
dents at W&L send them statistics on
chapter sizes and rush quotas so they
can become more familiar with the
W&L Panhellenic group.

Pi Beta Phi’s Grand Vice Presi-
dent of Membership Caroline Lesh
said that the sorority has been inter-

of success.

‘‘We would love to be on a cam-
pus like W&L,"’ Lesh said, ‘‘but we
do not want to come too soon.’’

She said if the group was to ac- -
- cept the bid, they would want the Pi

Beta Phi chapter size to be equivalent
to that of Chi-O, Kappa and Theta
within the first two or three years,
and this would drastically alter the
quotas and statistics of women’s rush.

‘Experience shows us that when
we are investigating an extension, it
is promising to see figures that show
we can equal in size within two or
three years,’’ Lesh said. ‘‘Our
chances of being strong in
Panhellenic and of having a strong
reputation would not be as good if
we weren't of comparable size shortly
after colonization.”’

But everyone seems to be willing
to make compromises for a new
group, and the PHC is already look-
ing into possible quota changes to
make a successful extension.

“‘We really want and need another
strong house here, and we’ve invited
one of the best,’’ Wyatt said, ‘‘but
for now all we can do is cross our
fingers and hope they will accept.”’

Handelman readies for China

Fudan University in Shanghai,
China will welcome Washington and
Lee Politics Prof. John R. Handelman
next week.

Not only will Handelman
research Chinese politics, but he will
also conduct five series of lectures.

“It’s an ideal setting to talk with
students and faculty about the post
Tiannamen incident of two years
ago,’’ Handelman said. ‘‘I'’d like to
see how the politics and opinions
have changed.”’

Handelman will research into th
population or family planning policy
of China. But his main area of re
search will be into the higher educa
tion policy.

‘Higher education is an interest
of mine and continues to be,’’ Han
delman said.

He will lecture on such subjects as
post-Cold War international system,
including President Bush’s New
World Order; the Persian Gulf Crisis
and its aftermath; and relations be-
tween the United States and Japan,
the Soviet Union, and China.

Handelman’s academic trip will
begin in Hong Kong on Saturday.
He will remain in Hong Kong for
four days, then he will begin his six
weeks of studies and lectures in
Shanghai.

In addition to his academic work,
Handelman looks forward to experi-
encing the culture and inhabitants of
the area.

‘Getting to know many people in
one place is one of the benefits of
this trip,’’ Handelman said.

“The chief benefit of the trip,

Smith speaks on future cars

Former GM head talks about the destination of transportation

 

By Jameson Leonardi
Staff Reporter

Retired General Motors Corp.
CEO Roger B. Smith gave the
Washington and Lee community a
taste of the future of personal
transportation last night in Lee
Chapel.

Smith, the retired chairman
and CEO of GM, gave a speech
entitled ‘‘Motoring into the 21st
Century: The Future of the Auto-
mobile,’’ sponsored by the Con-
tact Committee.

“Futurizing is risky, if you
venture out too far,’’ Smith said
at the beginning of his speech.
He said that the cars of tomorrow
would have certain elements com-
mon to today’s cars as well as
futuristic improvements.

Among these improvements

 

 

 

will be alternative fuel systems,
he said, and solar powered and
electric cars already exist at GM.
Another improvement is a com-
puter system that can detect ob-
jects near the car and warm the
driver in danger of a collision, he
said.

The list also includes devices
that help prevent a driver from
falling asleep at the wheel, Smith
said. Two engineers were brought
in for the multi-media presenta-
tion used during the speech. The
show presented some of the new
automobile technology GM_ is
working on, such as an exper-
imental solar-powered car.

An electric car called Impact
was also highlighted. The Impact
can accelerate from 0-60 mph in
8 seconds and has all the benefits
of a regular car, according to the
presentation, and GM plans to put

 

this car into production soon. +

For the speech, three GM
automobiles were set in front of’
the chapel. Two of the cars, a:
Corvette and a Saturn, were sup- |
plied by local dealerships. The’
third, a 1992 Cadillac Seville, has,
not yet been premiered to the
general public,

Smith is currently a member,
of the GM board of directors.
He serves on the boards of direc- *
tors of Johnson & Johnson,
Pepsico, and International Paper. '
Smith is also the originator of the +
GM Cancer Research Award,
which recognize the achievements *
of scientists for their work in,
Cancer research, treatment, and
prevention. .

**Personal transportation with ,
its glorious past and challenging
present has a vibrant and exciting +
future,’’ Smith said.

Mitchell said. Washington and Lee
sent one of the largest delegations,
about 50, because the rally was held
here, she said.

The students traveled to Washing-
ton, D.C. by bus and were taken to a
briefing room in the Old Executive
Office Building, across the street
from the White House.

There, the group listened to four
administration officials speak about
various aspects of the president’s do-
mestic agenda.

‘The theme was directing all the
energy and enthusiasm that was put
into the war into the domestic poli-
cy,”’ Mitchell said.

The next agenda item was

changed.

‘*We were supposed to take a tour
of the White House,’’ Short said,
‘but instead they took us out on the
lawn to watch the president and his
wife, Colin Powell and the presi-
dent’s dog get on a helicopter and ‘fly
away.’

‘*You know those people on the
lawn waving flags that you see ‘on
the news?’’ Mitchell said. ‘ That was
us.’”

Senior Paul Lagarde said he én-
joyed that part of the day and had ‘‘a
good time in Georgetown afterward.’

Short said ‘‘rumors that the dog,
Millie, attacked [senior] Charles Kra-
nich’’ are not true.

Students help
area homeless

 

By Alisha Johnson
Staff Reporter

 

After praying for five years that
would live to see her house pain-
ted, Gladys Steele can check that
request off her list.

Last Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday afternoons several Lexington
residents volunteered to scrape and
paint the Gladys House, Lexington’s
Shelter for the homeless.

“This house has needed painting
for 25 years and we finally made it,”’
Siecle said, who recognized the Bap-
list Student Union for their work in
pulling the event together. ‘‘I was
rather surprised to see such a turnout,
and | was really impressed with the
W&L students because most come
from families who don’t know of
homeless families.’’

[he Gladys House, which sits
below the Nelson Street overpass to
Harris Teeter, is two stories with
eight rooms and two bathrooms.

“‘[ think that we are in a great
location,’’ Steele said. “You can get

she

to the house from anywhere because
three or four roads pass by this
way.”’

Steele said that from November to
the last week in March she operates
the shelter, where individuals and
families come for a good meal at
night, clean beds, and a nice shower.

“‘We have volunteers locally and
from W&L who come to spend the
night, and many churches and local
people bring dinner,’’ Steele said.
“W&L has been a great help in
taking up canned foods. I'd like to
thank everyone for what they’ve
done.”’

Steele continues to dream of more
improvements for the homeless shel-
ter. She would like to see renova-
tions done to expand the size of the
House, and wants to work with the
city to keep the shelter open year-
round,

‘‘T’ve seen so many good things
come from here. People leave here
and get jobs. So many have kept in
touch with me to let me know how
good things have turned out for
them,’’ Steele said.

Russian advisor
hopes for change

 

By Joshua Manning
Staff Reporter

 

Dr. Alexei Yablokov, — science
advisor to Russian Republic Presi-
dent Boris Yeltsin, spoke to Washin-
gton and Lee students and faculty
Tuesday on the future of socialism.

A zoologist and ecologist by
trade, Yablokov gave up his job as a
professor at the Academy of Sciences
in Moscow to run for the Congress
of Peoples’ Deputies during the
Soviet Union’s first free elections in
over 7(0) years,

“My science could wait for a
year or two,’’ Yablokov said. ‘‘Politi-
cal change in my country could not.”’

Yablokov won his election and
later was appointed by the Congress
to the more elite upper house, the
Supreme Soviet. He now sits as Dep-
uty Chairman of the Committee on
Ecology and also serves as the chief
science advisor to Russian Republic
President Boris Yeltsin.

This week,
Lexington.

As this year’s final Telford Lec-
ture Series speaker, Yablokov spent
four days on campus speaking on the
future of social democracy.

In his speech, he asked the ques-
tion, ‘‘Can democracy be reconciled
with socialism?’’

The problem with such a broad
question, said Yablokov, is that there
are many forms of socialism. Forms
range from National Socialism (also
called fascism) to Gorbachev’s new
‘socialism with a human face,’’ he

Yablokov. was in

said.

Whatever: Soviet Socialism may
be, Yablokov said it has destroyed
the land, the environment, and the
infrastructure of the Soviet Union to
a point where the majority of its 15
republics now favor slashing the very
word Socialist from the country’s
name.

While Yablokov did say it is
possible to reconcile democracy and
socialism, he recommends that his
country look to such nations as Swe-
den for a role model.

The Soviet Union, said Yablokov
will have to completely overhaul its
gigantic military/industrial complex
encompassing over half the nation’s
work force. He said such a change
may prove an overwhelming shock to
the system.

‘We will have to learn that our
neighbors may be richer than us,”’
Yablokov said. ‘‘It will go against
the fundamental principles of commu-
nism.”’

Yablokov, however, is not a com-
munist; he is a self-styled ‘‘eco-
politician,’’ in deference to his first
love, ecology.

While initially following Gorb-
achev’s lead in the political arena,
Yablokov is now deeply critical of
the president’s recent return to hard-
line communism.

This week’s visit was Yablokov’s
second visit to Washington and Lee.
As head of a 30-member Soviet
delegation to an environmental con-
ference held here last June, he said
he was intrigued by the calm and
beauty of Lexington.

Registrar
drops fee

By Greg Patterson
Staff Reporter

 

 

Students who want to switch
classes the first week of a term will
no longer have to cough up five
bucks to do it; however, students who
wait until after the first week to
drop/add will be paying much more.

Elimination of the fee for each
drop/add is one of the changes in the
university registrar’s office policy,
according to D. Scott Dittman, regis-
trar.
“Students think the fee is a both-
er,’’ Dittman said. ‘‘Well, we think
it’s a bother, too.’’

Dittman said the elimination of
the fee reflects the opinion of the
faculty that ‘‘students should be al-
lowed to switch classes the first week
{of the term].’’

However, students who drop/add
after the scheduled period will have
to pay $25 and get the approval of
the Faculty Executive Committee.
Exceptions will be made for students
who are ‘‘accomodating departmental

Students will also have to pay $25

harassment, previously adjudicated by
the CRC, could be referred to the
Student Conduct Committee.

According to Howison, reviews of
cases of sexual assault greatly benefit
from a ‘‘mixture of both students and
faculty.

‘These are such sensitive issues,
that it’s absolutely vital to have both
students and faculty involved,’’ he
‘said.

Howison denied that the W&L
Harassment Policy prohibits the exer-
cise of free speech.

“T’'ve read through our policy,
and I don’t consider it a ‘speech
code,’’’ Howison said. ‘‘However, I
understand that there is an impression
that that is the case.’’

Despite this, Howison told the EC
Monday night that the reevaluation of
the CRC will emphasize any possible
infringements on free speech.

“T think a major problem with the
CRC and the Harassment Policy is
that it’s too ambiguous, and we
should consider tightening it up,”’
Howison said.

Another complaint voiced by the
EC concerns how the student mem-

bers of the CRC are appointed. Cur-
rently, University President John
Wilson appoints the three students.

EC Secretary Jeffery Kelsey said
it was inappropriate for the EC to
have no input with a committee that
has the authority to expel students.

‘We have been completely cut
out of the loop with the CRC,’’ he
said.

EC President-elect Giles Perkins
suggested the EC make the appoint-
ments rather than the administration.

‘‘Personally, I think the students
should become more involved in the
process,’’ said Howison. ‘‘The only
problem the EC might have is con-
vincing the skeptics that the appoint-
ments wouldn’t be just popularity
contests.’’

Howison said that any possible
changes in the either the Harassment
Policy or the CRC would come next
fall at the earliest. However, he said
he hoped to set up several meetings
over the summer with both student
leaders and faculty to begin discuss-
ing suggestions.

‘‘That way, we won't have to
start from scratch,’’ he said.

SPORTS
OWU tops W&L in NCAA Tournament

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

In many ways, the 1991 men’s
lacrosse season mirrored the 1987
season, right down to the final loss.

Both teams reached the NCAA
Division II] Tournament. Both teams
finished the season 11-4. And both
teams saw their seasons end after a
seven-plus hour bus trip to Ohio
Wesleyan University in Delaware,
Ohio. OWU sent the Generals home
disappointed with a 19-10 loss.

The 1991 team had won five
straight games heading into the play-
offs, including a 12-4 thrashing of
city-rival VMI in the Fourth Annual
Lee-Jackson Classic last Saturday.
During that stretch, W&L had out-
scored its opponents 78-25 and al-
lowed only one team to score over
five goals.

OWU also came into the game on
a winning streak. The Bishops had
won their last 12 games, including an
18-11 decision over W&L earlier in
the season. The Bishops entered the
tournament seeded second and had
scored 111 goals in their last five
games, including 57 in their last two.

When the action started, the Bish-
ops wasted little time continuing on
their scoring spree. Neil Ringers
opened the scoring just 34 seconds
into the game.

Trailing 2-0, sophomore defense-
man Kirk Olsen got the Generals on
the board when he brought the ball
the length of the field unchecked and
scored the first goal of his career.
W&L tied the game at 3-3 with 6:05
left in the quarter on goals by senior
Todd Garliss and junior Drew Anton.

OWU reclaimed a 4-3 lead before
sophomore David Lefkowitz tied
things at 4-4 at the end of the first
quarter. Anton scored his second goal
of the game to tie the game again at
5-5 with 12:47 left in the first half,
but for the rest of the first half, the
Bishops took control of the game.

The Bishops scored the last four
goals of the half, including Tom
Mott’s shot just before the clock ran
out, and then the first two goals of
the second half to take an 11-5 lead.

Senior Mike Pardo scored to
break OWUs run, and sophomore

John Hunter scored to close the gap
to 11-7 with 4:46 left in the third
quarter, but Bill Bishop answered for
— to push the lead back out to

‘When we scored two in a row,
I thought if we could get one more
and cut the lead to three, we'd be
back in the game,"’ said head coach
Jim Stagnitta. “We had enough
close-i “in Opportunities to make it a
game.’

But OWU goalie Rich Flynn came
up big time after time in keeping
WA&L from converting enough oppor-
tunities. Flynn finished the game with
20 saves.

“Offensively, we never really got
it going until the second quarter,’’
said senior Clark Wight. ‘Their
goalie had a terrific game. We just
couldn’t put the ball in the net.”’

The Bishops put the game away in
the fourth quarter, led by Rich Franz,
who scored four of his five goals in
the quarter. OWU took a 19-9 lead
before senior Mike Moseman scored
with 32 seconds left to provide the
final margin, 19-10.

‘Coming in, we knew we had to
shoot well and minimize our defen-
sive mistakes,’’ said Stagnitta. ‘*We
ended up playing a lot of defense,
and you can’t stay on defense and
expect them not to score.’’

Franz set an NCAA Toumament
record with 11 points on five goals
and six assists.

The loss overshadowed a fine
performance by W&L goalie Tom
Costello, who made 19 saves on the
day.

“If you told me before the game
that Cos was going to make 20
saves, I’d have said we'd win,’’ said
Stagnitta. ‘‘He made some great
saves, some all-american saves.’’

A dejected Costello said OWU
just didn’t make mistakes.

“‘T let some things in that I proba-
bly shouldn’t have,’’ he said. ‘I
made some good saves, too, but they
just didn’t make any mistakes when
they got in close.’’

‘‘We tried as hard as we physical-
ly could,’’ said Wight. ‘‘They just
stuck it in the cage more. Cos had a
great game but they just had so many
opportunities.’’

Senior Todd Garliss scores one of his three goals in Saturday’s
12-4 win over VMI in the Lee-Jackson Classic. Garliss finished the

OWU outshot W&L 56-35.

Costello said W&L simply got
beat by a better team.

‘They were just better than we
were,’’ he said. ‘‘We had a couple of
chances, but we could never really
put it together. They just beat us.’’

The Generals finish the season 11-
4 and ranked sixth in the nation.
Stagnitta was honored as Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference Coach of the
Year and Wight was named ODAC
Player of the Year. Both agreed the

said Wight. ‘‘We accomplished four

top six teams in the country.”’

Even in the loss, Stagnitta was
reminded of the trademark of the
1991 Generals, hustle and heart.

Sun shines on
Spring sports

By Chris Simon

It has been a productive spring
for Washington and Lee athletics.

An unprecedented five teams
clinched Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference titles this season and at least
three will have made appearances at
NCAA Division III national champi-
onships this month.

For the first time since 1987, the
W&L men’s lacrosse team (11-3, 5-
0 in the ODAC) received a bid for
the Division III national tournament.
The ODAC champion Generals, rank-
ed sixth in the nation, lost to second-
ranked Ohio Wesleyan, 19-10, yester-
day in Delaware, Ohio. See page six.

Women’s tennis received its first
NCAA team championship bid on
Sunday after dominating the ODAC
tournament for the second time in
three years and finishing the season
ranked eleventh in the nation.

“This is a once in a lifetime op-
portunity,’’ said head coach Cinda
Rankin. ‘‘I’m so excited.”’

The Generals, who sat precarious-
ly on the edge of the post-season
playoffs, got an invitation on Sunday
from: the NCAA to participate at
Emory University for the 1991 finals.

Men’s tennis finished this season

their sixth NCAA tournament appear-
ance in seven seasons on May 12-15
in Claremont, CA. No. 12 W&L

““We’re thrilled for the opportuni-
ty to go,’’ said head coach Gary
Franke. ‘‘A little bit depends on the
luck of the draw.”’

The Generals’ 1991 season came
to a close with another narrow loss.

As it seems they have all season,
the Generals played to the level of
their competition, hanging tough until
falling to Shenandoah, 6-3, last Tues-
day.

Junior T.J. Daly supplied eight
steady innings on the mound, and the
Generals’ defense played error-free
baseball. W&L collected 10 hits and
five walks but were only able to
translate those numbers into three
runs, which proved to be their down-
fall. All told, W&L stranded 10 base-
runners, including five in the first
three innings.

Head coach Jeff Stickley said the
team’s inability to pick up runs early
in the game was the difference.

‘‘We just didn’t score early, that
was the big thing,’’ he said. ‘‘If we
had it would have been a different
ballgame.’’ ’

As it was, the game remained
scoreless until a two-run Homet hom-
er in the fourth. The next Shenandoah
rally, in the fifth, was aided by a
questionable call by the umpire, who
called Daly for a balk. The umpire’s
judgment upset Daly and Stickley,
who was ejected from a game for the
first time in five years.

“TI didn’t do anything I thought
would get me ejected. If I had known

x | ERR A ae Se cee gies

 

 

 

 
 
 
 

he was going to throw me out I
would have gotten my money’s
worth,’ Stickley said.

The mishap helped increase the
Hornet lead to 5-0. Senior Ron Katz
led off the seventh inning for W&L
with a solo homerun. Sophomore
John Hesse, senior J.T. Swartz, and
freshman Michael Ross followed with
consecutive hits to cut the lead to 5-
2. Shenandoah responded by scoring
one run in their half of the seventh.

In the eighth, a Daly walk, fol-
lowed by hits from senior Chris
Kavanagh and freshman Eric Peifer
produced the General’s final run, as
well as the game’s final 6-3 score.
Hesse and Peifer both had two hits
on the afternoon.

Despite the loss the Generals
remained positive about the 1991
campaign and prospects for next year.

‘‘We were much better than last
year,”’ Stickley said. ‘‘We made big
steps in the right direction. We
improved at the plate and as the year
went on we made fewer errors. I’m
already excited about next year be-
cause we’ve got most of the team
back and they will have a lot more
experience.’’

Kavanagh summed up the season
this way.

“It was kind of disappointing
vecause we beat [Division 1] Holy

Cross and [ODAC Champs] Bridge-
water but lost to teams we should
have beat. Our inconsistency was
frustrating, but I had a lot of fun.

sor Taylor Sanders,

W&L’s unofficial historian.

The Goshen tradition began when
Commodore Mathew Fontaine Maury,
a naval officer and scientist, fell in
love with the beautiful scenery back
when Robert E. Lee was still alive.

It was Commodore Maury’s dying
wish that his body be taken through
Goshen Pass when the laurel and
rhodadendrum were in bloom.

A traditional day at Goshen to-
ward the tum of the century found
Don Stokley’s barrels of whiskey
scattered on the banks of the river.

The merchant kept them there
until the river rose high enough for
him to transfer them by flat boat to

The Ring-tum Phi, May 9, 1991

the market in Lynchburg. If the
market price wasn’t fair in
Lynchburg, he simply floated them
down to Richmond.

Stokley sold his cargo and boat at
his final destination, then he and his
three-man crew would walk home to
start all over again.

Legend has it that students first
went out to Goshen because ‘‘you
could smell the remains of Old Man
Stokley’s whiskey in the air!’’

Shortly after the turn of the cen-
tury a Lexington man named Henry
Boley published a history of the city.
In his book he speaks of Goshen

Assistant Dean of Students
Kenneth P. Ruscio '76 and Assis-
tant Director of Alumni Programs

Robert W.H. Mish °76 will ex-
perience their 25-year class re-
union on two levels.

They shared insights on W&L
life from their unique perspectives
as both alumni and _ ad-
ministrators.

Both Ruscio and Mish agree
that the Honor System is. still
going strong at Washington and
Lee.

“T don’t think the Honor
System has deteriorated at all.
It’s still a central part of student
life,’’ said Ruscio. ‘‘It’s my
impression that students still take
it seriously.”’

Ruscio also said he thinks the
balance between academics and
social life is much the same today
as it was 25 years ago.

‘“‘The social life was more
artificial then, in that girls were
here from Friday to Sunday and
were dates more than anything
else,’’ he said.

Mish said the main difference
he sees in the social life stems
from the lowered drinking age.
He remembers freshmen sponsor-

 

Mish in 1975

ing the grain party Fancy Dress
Weekend.

According to Mish, playing a
dual role in alumni reunions
enhances the experience.

“‘T’m better off being so in-
volved in the planning behind this
weelcend,’’ he said. ‘‘I enjoy
watching everyone have a good
time.”’

The limitations of the average
student budget only complicate these
problems. However, having a budget
that provides for only an occasional
Country-Cookin’-level meal does not
necessarily mean one has to sink to
that level.

Not even periodic episodes of
bankruptcy should deter the adven-
turous gourmet, so we have set out to
prove that it is possible to eat well in
and around Rockbridge County for
under five dollars.

Our first excursion took us to
Cozy Corner Restaurant in Goshen,
cleverly disguised as two hungry
farmers. The disguise ensured that we
would not receive preferential service
intended to favorably influence our
review.

We borrowed a 1974 ‘‘Big 10’’
Chevy pick-up truck, complete with
rusted fender panels, bullet holes and
an inconspicuous, two-tone, light-

 

brown paint job. Friendly waves from
area residents let us know our dis-
guise was effective.

After a brief 20-minute drive
through beautiful Goshen Pass, we
came to the Cozy Comer, which sits
at the junction of Route 39 and
Route 42, across from the Stillwater
Textile Mill in the town of Goshen.

The owners, two sisters who
bought the Cozy Corner from their
Uncle Bob, said the restaurant had
once been a rowdy ‘‘booze ’em up.”
‘‘But hopefully when we get our
liquor license, there won’t be any
more broken windows or fights,’
they told us.

Anyway... the place was well-lit,
reasonably quiet and cooled by old-
fashioned ceiling fans. A_ pretty
young waitress directed us to table
number seven, and handed us two
dog-eared menus. Although we found
table number seven to be a bit wob-
bly, the problem was _ quickly
remedied by the strategic placement
of a few packs of matches.

Settling into the restaurant’s com-
fortable, form-fitting plastic chairs,
we surveyed the menu and found a
little something for everyone.

The seafood lover can choose
from fried or steamed shrimp ($7.50),
fried or broiled flounder ($4.95) and
fried or steamed oysters ($6.95). A
traditionalist might be alarmed at first

that the Cozy Corner does not serve
country fried steak, but one could
certainly appreciate the country ham
steak ($4.25), fried chicken ($4.25) or
the burger steak ($3.75).

The restaurant’s menu also fea-
tures a wide variety of salads and
fruit plates, as well as a_ broiled
chicken breast ($3.75) for diners who
are watching their figures.

Since we saw no evidence of
ocean water or an air strip in or near
Goshen, we decided the seafood
might be less than fresh, and opted
for two traditional selections. Both
were served with a garden salad,
fresh vegetables and hot rolls with
butter. The fried chicken was excel-
lent, and the country ham steak was
delicate and cooked to perfection.

However, a word of caution is in
order: avoid the peas. They formed
an overcooked, greenish-yellow mass
bathed in Country Crock Margarine,
and tasted like a bowl of ashes in
warm pea juice. The mashed pota-
toes did not look much like a vegeta-
ble either.

Overall, the Cozy Corner was
excellent. The main courses are
well-prepared, the atmosphere relax-
ing, the prices reasonable, and the
waitresses friendly. The iced tea is
all you can drink, and they accept
Master Card and Visa. What more
could anyone ask for?

The signs are in place, the cock-
tail napkins are folded, and the door
handle of Lee Chapel is shined and
polished; Washington and Lee is
ready for another alumni weekend to
begin.

But, several alumni decided to
throw W&L a curve this year by
showing up a week early. One of
them, Frank Turner, Sr., '62, shared
his impressions of the campus as it
is, and not how the university wants
it to appear.

‘*‘The two changes I noticed im-
mediately was the lack of the law
school from the colonnade and the
addition of the new library,’’ Turner
said Wednesday. ‘‘Also, there seemed
to be a lot more girls on campus

Alumnus shares his
impressions of W&L

when I was here,’’ he said with a
smile.

Turner said his biggest disappoint-
ment was the lack of a freshman
assimilation committee, and therefore
a breakdown of the speaking tradi-
tion.

‘‘Walking down the colonnade
reminded me of the streets of New
York,’’ Turner said. ‘‘People just
stared at their feet. When I was here,
everyone said hello to you, and you’d
feel stupid if you didn’t say hello
back.’’

Turner said that the school should
stress a well-rounded individual,
instead of stressing academics only.

When asked about the Fraternity
Renaissance, Turner said that he felt
the administration would better know
what is good for the university, but
he did mention that it seemed like an
awful lot of money to spend.
