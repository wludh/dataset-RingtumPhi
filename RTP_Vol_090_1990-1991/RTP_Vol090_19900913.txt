WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

Students
injured in
car accident

 

By Pat Lopes
Editor

 

A Washington and Lee sopho-
more was charged with driving while
intoxicated after he and another W&L
student were seriously injured in a
car accident early Saturday morning
on Route 631 near Lexington.

Brandon J. Green was allegedly
driving under the influence of alcohol
shortly after 1 a.m. when he lost
control of his car in an area known
as Bean’s Bottom, Virginia state
trooper Steve Canada said.

Elizabeth C. Hancock, a W&L
sophomore who was riding in the
front seat wearing her seat belt, was
gashed on her forehead, scalp and left
hip and her left leg was bruised, she
said. She was transported by
helicopter to the Roanoke Memorial
Hospital intensive care unit from
Stonewall Jackson Hospital.

Green, who was not wearing his
seat belt, had glass from the wind-
shield embedded in the right side of
his face, forehead and scalp. His left
leg was also bruised. He was treated
and released at Stonewall Jackson
Hospital.

Coleman J. Devlin, a W&L
junior, who was riding in the back
seat, was not injured, police said.

Green was driving half a mile east
of Route 604 on Route 631 when he
lost control of his car, Canada said.
The car swerved to the right, back on

‘to the road and then off the right

shoulder, smashing into a tree, he
said.

A Lexington rescue squad spent
about 20 minutes cutting Hancock out
of the car, Canada said.

Doctors at Roanoke Memorial
Hospital stitched the gash on her
head, which stretches from her right
eye, up onto her forehead, around the
top of her scalp and to the back her
head.

Hancock is now in stable condi-
tion at Roanoke Memorial awaiting
plastic surgery.

Green said his face hit the wind-
shield and shattered it and splintered
glass gouged into his face. Doctors at
Stonewall Jackson Hospital gave him
thirteen stitches.

Green is back at school attending
classes.

Hancock said road conditions lead
to the mishap. Green was unfamiliar
with the twists and turns on the dark
country road, she said. A lead car
was also kicking dust and gravel into
the headlights of Green’s car.

“Tt wasn’t like it was Brandon’s
fault,’’ Hancock said. ‘‘Those country
roads can really be dangerous.”’

Green will not comment on details
of the accident or the drunken driving
charge because of his upcoming trial.
His court date is set for Oct. 24 in
Lexington.

Green expressed remorse for
Hancock. ‘‘The thing I feel so bad
about is the fact that the injury oc-
curred to Liz. I kind of wish that all
that happened to me,’’ he said.

Committee to re-evaluate spring term

 

By Blair Simmons
Staff Reporter

 

Dean of the College John Elrod is
forming a committee to evaluate the spring
term in response to the ‘‘chorus of voices
raised’’ questioning the effectiveness of the
term, he said.

‘‘The current calendar is 21 years old and
it was an experimental calendar then and we
haven’t, so far as I know, in that entire
history examined carefully the most
experimental part of the calendar, the short
six week term,’’ Elrod said.

The committee, which consists of nine
faculty members and two students, is charged
to ‘‘put the term under a microscope’’ and
determine how the faculty and students are

utilizing it, he said.

‘“‘The committee has to ask itself these
fundamental questions: Does the spring term
advance our academic purposes? Does the
spring term enhance our desire for academic
excellence? Is it, from the standpoint of
fulfilling our purposes in creating academic
excellence, an asset or a liability?’’ Elrod
said.

Saying the committee will make a
recommendation to him in early February,
Elrod emphasized it is not designed to be a
think tank or a forum for opinions.

‘*These committee members are not going
to sit around and think about the term but are
going to go to work and gather specific data
about how the term is affecting our academic
programs,’’ Elrod said.

Prof. H. Thomas Williams, the chairman

of the committee, said they will begin by
looking at historical documents about the
term, and then specifically at the spring term
now: what kind of courses are offered and
what kind of enrollment patterns exist.

Calling it ‘tan awful lot of quantitative
data analysis,’’ Williams said the committee’s
main job will be to poll the student body, the
faculty and the administrators.

“‘The committee is asked to end up with
one of three conclusions,’’ said Williams.
‘*One conclusion might be characterized as:
the spring term is healthy in its present form
and should be retained. Another is that in its
conception the spring term is a good idea but
needs some adjustments in the course
offerings to make it better. The third possible
conclusion could be that the spring term as
a notion is intrinsically flawed.’’

Although the viability of the spring term
has been questioned several times in the past,
Elrod said this is the first in depth study on
it.

Two years ago, Elrod asked each
academic department to inform him of its
preference regarding the elimination of the
term, and the majority (although ‘‘not a
strong majority’) were in favor of keeping
the term, he said.

In 1984, a calendar committee
recommended the reaffirmation of the 12-12-
6 calendar after a cursory analysis, Elrod
said.

‘*Whenever you’re evaluating an academic
calendar the primary consideration is does it
contribute to the realization of our goals and
purposes as an academic institution; but it is
also important to look at a calendar in terms

of the things outside the classroom,’’ Elrod
said.

He said he tried to get a balance of the
divisions within the undergraduate program
when choosing the committee members, with
a representative from the Commerce School,
the physical sciences, the social sciences, the
humanities and the languages. He also tried
to get a cross-section of senior and junior
faculty members.

Willard Dumas and Elizabeth Talkington,
the students on the committee, will convey
student attitudes and serve as a liaison
between the committee and the student body,
Elrod said.

The next step in the evaluation of the
spring term will be determined by the content
of the committee’s report and its
recommendation, Elrod said.

DG Rush begins next week

 

By Pamela Kelley
Staff Reporter

 

The Delta Gamma Women’s Fraternity is hoping the
approximately 180 unaffiliated upperclass women at
Washington and Lee will take heed of its colonization
slogan ‘‘Catch the Wave,’’ and participate in its first
formal Rush, which kicks off with an open house on
Sept. 19,

According to Kathy Wood, a member of DG’s
expansion team who is currently on campus to handle
DG’s initial publicity and legwork, DG will hold sign-
ups starting Monday in front of the Co-op for all upper-
class women interested in attending its open house on
campus some time next week.

Wood said that those who do not sign up are also
welcome to attend,

Rush will be conducted by DG national representa-
tives, active members from nearby chapters, and local
alumni advisors, who will be on hand to meet rushees.

DG rush begins with the open house and concludes
Sept. 22, when bids will be extended.
extend bids to up-

perclassmen after the formal Rush period is over and will
participate in the Winter Rush for freshmen with the three
established W&L sororities, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa
Kappa Gamma, and Chi Omega.

Wood, who will also serve as the DG colony’s
collegiate development consultant, was on hand in the
upperclassmen matriculation line with local DG Interest
Group members to let independent females know more
about DG.

The approximately 15-member interest group, which
is comprised of women who were either not extended
bids or did not sign preference cards during Winter Rush,
began meeting after DG's January decision to delay
colonization because of a disappointing turnout at its first
open house, which followed Winter Rush.

Most of the members of the interest group formally
committed themselves at that time to rush DG if the
sorority decided to colonize at W&L. The group said they
hoped to increase interest in DG among the unaffiliated
women On campus.

DG President Maureen Syring said although the
number of interested women was quite disappointing in

Survey data withheld

Results from
date-rape survey
called ‘in line’

By Alisann McGloin
Staff Reporter

 

 

Results of a date rape survey con-
ducted at Washington and Lee last
winter term have not yet been rel-
eased despite promises of a fall an-
nouncement, but Associate Dean of
Students Anne Schroer-Lamont said
the data is ‘‘right in line with nation-
al statistics,’’

Though the actual results have not
yet been released, Schroer-Lamont
said steps have already been taken to
reduce the risk of date rape at W&L
through education and information.

Schroer-Lamont pointed to the
honor code as a reason why W&L’s
numbers should be significantly low-
er. ‘‘Honor in dating and sexual
relations is as important as cheating
on a test,’ she said.

The survey, which was composed
by a support group for date rape
victims, was completed by one-third
of W&L’s female students. One-fifth
of them were law students,

Seventy-eight percent of last
year’s freshmen women who re-
sponded to the survey revealed cer-
tain problems during the year that
enabled this year’s freshmen to ben-
efit from their experience. A question
asking women the month and year of
a date or acquaintance rape revealed
that the occurrence of these incidents
1s greatest early in the freshman year.

Ovral, a legal ‘‘morning-after’’ pill that prevents implantation of a fer-
tilized egg in a woman’s uterus, has been available at Washington and
Lee’s Health Center since coeducation was established in 1985, W&L

Ovral is used differently than the highly-publicized RU 486, more
commonly known as the abortion pill. RU 486, which is illegal in the
United States but used throughout Europe, is taken once a woman has
tested positive for pregnancy, at least a month after conception. The drug
causes a spontaneous chemical abortion.

Ovral is taken before a fertilized egg has time to implant itself in the
uterus, usually within 12 to 72 hours after intercourse.

Studies have shown near perfect success rates among women who have
used the drug. Only minor adverse affects, such as nausea, vomiting and
breast tenderness have been reported.

Based on recent studies, the risk of cancer is not related to the use of

Schroer-Lamont met at the beginn-
ing of the summer with President
John Wilson regarding the survey, at
which point a complete analysis of
the results had not yet been comp
leted. Schroer-Lamont and Wilson
were to meet yesterday to discuss the
final results and how the
University will respond to and report
the results officially.

Lamont said. Posters all around cam-
pus warn students of the risk of
‘‘campus rape.”’

Although Schroer-Lamont empha-
sized the need to begin awareness
with freshmen, certain measures have
been taken to reach upperclassmen as
well, she said. An informational vid
eotape is currently being shown in
the waiting room of the infirmary.
OPINION

Wa&L environment

Blake Comer failed the tradition of Washington and Lee,
its students and, most of all, Ashley Scarborough and her
family by refusing to come forth and accept the blame for
his misdeeds.

To have him back in our community, as a member of the
student body, would make fallacies of all the qualities that
Washington and Lee purports to claim as part of its
environment; values such as honesty, integrity, courtesy and
compassion. His return would be wrong, no matter how
well-intentioned are the technicalities that would allow his
return.

But, has he alone failed the university and its heritage?
We don’t think so.

Certainly, no one would be foolish enough to believe that
Comer was the first W&L student to drive after drinking too
much, and it’s unlikely that Comer’s example will be
enough to forever disuade other students from drinking and
driving in the future. In fact, the example may not have
even lasted two weeks. Yet another W&L student stands
accused of driving under the influence, resulting in a
accident.

This sort of nonchalance regarding responsible behavior
caused Judge Rudolph Bumgardner III to characterize
Washington and Lee, in his final remarks in the Comer case,
as being an ‘uncontrolled enviornment.”” He also called the
tragedy ‘‘a low point for an institution known for its
honesty and integrity.”’

The Honor Code is the most revered convention we live
by. We pride ourselves on having our conduct governed by
one simple over-arching principle, that of acting honorably,
instead of a volumous series of trite, shallow and
insignificant rules and regulations.

Every aspect of Comer’s behavior and that of his friends
was so far from the principle of honorable behavior as to
chill even the most cynical observer. The accident itself was
horrifying and tragic, but what followed was just as rotten.

Comer fled from the scene and covered up his guilt for
several months. The actions of Comer and his friends, who
lived with the terrible secret of their role in this tragedy,
reeked of subterfuge, deceit_and treachery.

Their gross disregard for the conventions of honorable
behavior belied what President Wilson termed in his address
at Opening Convocation, a ‘‘failure of nerve, failure of
moral courage and failure to see the right thing to do.”

Wilson called out to the Class of 1991 to provide
leadership, direction and maturity, and presented the seniors
with this special challenge, ‘‘to try to help our new students
to fasten lastingly upon the best of our traditions and values
and expectations.”’

Every member of the Washington and Lee community,
especially those in the student body, must strive in the
utmost to return our code of conduct to what General Lee
intended.

We must view the honor code as an all-encompassing
ethical code, rather than merely a set of printed edicts
riddled with loopholes. Let the principle of honorable
behavior guide us in the larger decisions we make, and the
smaller decisions will fall naturally into line.

If we fail to heed Wilson’s request, then our community
is as bad as Judge Bumgardner would believe.

But if we persevere and instill in our successors a
reverence for the best of the traditions of Washington and
Lee, then we have made our university richer. As Wilson
concluded, ‘‘You cannot make a greater contribution to
Washington and Lee than to succeed in this undertaking.”’

MY VIEW

By J. Cameron
Humphries

 

Memory serving, the first issue of
last year’s The Ring-tum Phi also
contained a ‘‘My View’’ questioning
the logic, justice, and effectiveness of
our Honor Code in the modern world.
How could any system of honor, the
article questioned, expel a person for
stealing’ a candy bar while allowing

~ ‘a -fapist’ to remain a part of our

community? Though I remember few
of the article’s specific details, I do
recall its message leaving a
significant impact upon me, and an
impression which was not particularly
favorable. If my recollection is at all
correct, then last week’s ‘‘My
View’’, which again questioned the
justice in our Honor Code, presents
the beginning of a dangerous and
potentially destructive tradition at
Washington and Lee - a
misunderstanding and misapplication
of the spirit and purpose of General
Lee’s greatest gift to our University,
the Honor System.

This year’s ‘‘My View”
questioned any Honor Code which
could expel a person for mistakenly
presenting someone else’s work as
his own, while possibly allowing a
hit-and-run driver to retum to the
University after a only a year’s
absence. Quite simply, this is a very
valid, important, and indeed necessary
question. Furthermore, the article
also included a scenario involving a
student and the CRC. If stealing a
candy bar is an honor violation,
shouldn’t raping a woman be

considered one as well? How, then,
should the University respond to a
world in which the ideals of honor,
truth and integrity have been long
since abandoned?

“‘Duty,’’ General Lee stated, ‘‘is
the sublimest word in our language.”’
Yet, our present society does not like
the concept of duty, especially duty
to something as abstract as honor.
Instead, our society rests upon
detailed rules. And it is far easier, it
requires far less moral fibre to follow
a coded book of rules and regulations
than to live one’s life by the ideal of

an_absiract concept. *

To dilute the Honor
System by altering
the single sanction,
or creating degrees
of honor debases
the heritage of the

 

Honor Code
But it is living one’s life by an
abstract ideal that General Lee

commanded his students to do, at all
times, in all places, and under all
circumstances. Quite simply, he left
no loopholes for Washington and Lee
students to use as an escape from
doing their duty to honor. And
unlike the concept put forth in the
CRC, his command left no second
chance for students who violated their
honor to ‘“‘undergo therapy,’’ or to
“pay their debt to society.”
According to the Honor Code, either
you are honorable or you are not.

I will always remember the
example of my Scoutmaster when I
was a young boy. At summer camp,
he secured the soft drinks, candy and

 
  

other valuables with only a cheap
lock which any one could hime easily
picked or broken if they wished to
help themselves to a Coke or a
Snickers bar. When I pointed this
out to him and asked him why he did
not use a more secure lock he said,
‘Scouts, locks aren’t designed to
keep thieves out. All they can do is
keep honest people, honest.’’

It is no different with our Honor
System. No system, no set of rules,
regardless of how detailed and
encompassing, can keep dishonorable
persons from lying, cheating, or
stealing. As General Lee noted, there
is but one solution: excusing them
from our community.

Therefore, while the current
system may allow rapists to remain
in our midst, freeing others who have
violated our community of trust from
their duty to honor does nothing to
restore or strengthen our community.
A jail keeper does not release the
petty-cash thieves merely because he
cannot catch the armed robbers. And
in the framework of the Honor
System, the candy-bar thief is as
dishonorable as the thief who steals
Washington’s painting from Lee
Chapel. To dilute the Honor Code
by altering the single sanction, or
creating degrees of honor debases the

heritage of the Honor Code to this
point: it insults those honorable
persons who will graduate from
Washington and Lee in the future, it
tarnishes our tradition of honor, and
it also belittles the loss of those who
have left our community because they
were unable to meet Lee’s standards
of honor. The system must enforce
the principle that either you are
honorable, or you are dishonorable.
It is exactly such black-and-white,

OH Boy!
LIAATA SELECTIONT

many rules stifle honor

such either-or philosophy which
discomforts so many people today.’
And why should it not? Taking a,
stand, perhaps more than any other
action, terrifies the twentieth century
person. Society tells us that no
action, no belief, and no moral
position is completely wrong. And:
when we choose to judge an action.
at all, its usually to diminish its
significance. Our lives are full of’
“‘little’’ lies, sins, and crimes. Once
again, it offers us one more
opportunity from within our fallen
state to point the finger and to
divorce ourselves from. accountability
to ourself, to mankind, and to our '

As a community,
Washington and Lee
must return to a
concept of duty to —
honor

God, by observing a morally destitute
world and then finding comfort in the
belief that we are not as bad as
some.

If the Honor System is to survive,
it needs fewer rules, not more. As a
community, Washington and Lee
must return to the concept of duty to
honor, and not a system of rules set
forth in a book. Our White Book
revisions committee needs to force its
students to live by moral character,
and not by rules. ’

Then, not only will there be equal
justice for all at W&L, but there will
also be the opportunity for its
graduates to promote justice in the
real world, which now surrounds us
in crumbling decay at the base of our
Hill.

 

Sbar examines the Middle East

 
   

 

 

 
  

 

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

Due to a recent case of boredom compounded
by the frontal lobotomy I received over the
summer, I have decided to write some
distinguished commentary involving the recent
crisis in the Middle East.

The Middle East, which lies between the Near
East and the Far East, is a hostile, sun-scorched
piece of worthless desert inhabited by religious
zealots who express themselves by burning
American flags in front of television cameras. This
is why whenever we turn on our televisions to
watch Bullwinkle, we see religious zealots in the
Middle East burning American flags.

Of course, the religious zealots in the Middle
East must compete for air time with the First
Amendment zealots in America, who are also fond
of burning American flags in front of television
cameras.

Someone besides me should probably travel to
the Middle East and tell the religious zealots that
burning American flags is getting a bit old. If they
want to really make a statement, I suggest that
they pour kerosene on their local politicians. We'd
probably watch that even before Bullwinkle.

Although no one wants to admit it, we're all
kind of relieved by the recent tension in the
Middle East. For one thing, it means that we no
longer have to hear about Mikhail ‘‘stop staring at
my forehead mole’’ Gorbachev and the recent
Russian discovery that Chicken McNuggets taste
better than boiled potatoes.

 

‘*Perestroika’’ is supposed to denote the Soviet
Union’s recent move towards democratic reform ,
but it sounds more like a Soviet slang word for
male genitalia or a drink tasting like a Harvey
Wallbanger that one might order in a bar. This is
getting slightly off of the subject, but if any one
out there has ever had a Harvey Wallbanger I'd
like to hear about it.

A major problem with the Middle East is that
we're having a great deal of trouble distinguishing
allies from enemies. Even the people in friendly
countries are wearing turbans and buming
American flags.

It’s also difficult keeping track of the individual
countries. Iraq, for example, used to be a puny,
good for nothing country that couldn’t even win a
war against our long-time nemesis, Iran. Now, all
of a sudden, they show up in Kuwait with a
million-man army, an arsenal of chemical weapons
and a dictator with a Ghenghis Khan complex.

Speaking of Kuwait, no one besides a handful
of geography teachers even knew that the place
existed before this crisis. Now it pops up as a
critical oil producing nation and we all have to
pretend that we knew it’s exact location years ago.

An interesting aspect of this Middle East fiasco
is the subtle influence involved leaders have on
the stock market. It’s impossible to pick up a
newspaper these days for some innocent reason like
whacking your girlfriend across the face without
seeing some Earth-shattering news of the stock
market:

“The stock market rose 50 points yesterday
morning after reliable sources reported that
Saddam Hussein woke up with a bad case of
diarrhea. Later in the day, however, the market
fell 50 points after reporters following President
Bush around on his Kennebunkarunkfunk

vacation witnessed the Secretary of State snag
his fishing hook on the president’s ear.”’

Another important player in the complex
Middle East affair is OPEC (Old Potbellied
Eggheaded Codfish), a group of buddies who meet
every so often at Octnod’s Bar and Grill to drink
beer and cause world turmoil by raising or
lowering the price of gasoline for completely
random reasons.

OPEC Representative: ‘‘I heard Iraq invaded
Kuwait yesterday just for the hell of it. I say we
raise oil prices so that it costs an extra quarter to
purchase a gallon of gasoline in America.”’

Second OPEC Representative: ‘‘Good idea.
Hey, where is Kuwait anyway?”’

Third OPEC Representative: ‘“‘Hey Octnod,
how about another round of brew for the OPEC

_

Unfortunately, the United States has been forced
to send young men over to Saudi Arabia in order
to protect vital oil interests and hopefully rescue a
few American flags. Somehow, it doesn’t seem fair
that males in the bloom of youth are the ones that
get sent to die in war.

People in their early twenties should be home
experimenting with psychedelic drugs, enjoying
their sexual primes and listening to rock music. In
other words, people in their early twenties should
be in college.

Wait a minute, that’s the wrong generation.
People in their early twenties should be at home
joining gyms, dating people who haven't tested
positive for AIDS and getting into law school.

What I’m trying to say, in a very roundabout
manner, is that I think President Bush should round
up the nation’s rednecks, arm them with pick-up
trucks, shotguns, country music and smokeless
tobacco products and drop them off in Iraq.

The Ring-tum Phi,

SAB announces'‘plans for

 

By Macon Miles
Staff Reporter

The SAB opened its concert
schedule last Friday night with the
Waxing Poetics performing at the
student pavilion. The low attendance
disappointed the SAB, which fell
short of breaking even by 50 percent,
according to SAB Chairman Katie
Duwel.

“‘We were a little disappointed
that rush played such an important
role in participation in the concert,”’
said Duwel, ‘‘but I think people liked
it.”” Duwel and Concert Coordinator
Dabney Collier said they remain
optimistic about the remaining events
planned for this academic year.

The SAB’s fall concerts include a
free concert by Left Exit on Sunday,
Sept. 16. It will be held either in the

_ Dell or on the Law School fields.
Echo’s Farm will play in the General
Headquarters on Wednesday, Sept.
19. The Boneshakers will also play in

ARE koe

the GHQ on Oct. 3.

Ticket prices for the two perfor-
mances in the GHQ will be an-
nounced at a later date. ‘‘We’re not
trying to make money. We just want
to provide students with activities
they enjoy,’ said Duwel. ‘‘We’re
trying to keep the prices down so
more people will come.’’

According to both Duwel and Col-
lier, the Smithereens are scheduled to
be the feature band for Homecoming,
although plans are not definite.

Duwel said tentative events for the
SAB are planned for November,
Christmas Weekend, and the opening
of the Lenfest Center.

Duwel also mentioned that the SAB
wants to book a comedian and pos-
sibly a hypnotist this year.

In addition, the SAB is consider-
ing combining Lip-sync and bingo in
late January, having bingo games
between lip-sync acts. These plans
and others will be finalized after the
SAB members are chosen.

Interviews for this year’s SAB
will be Monday and Tuesday, Sept.
17 and 18. Interviews may also be
held on Wednesday if an excessive
number of students apply.

‘We're really looking for inter-
esting people and diversity. We really
welcome freshman  involvement,’’
Duwel said.

Applications will be accepted until

Duwel says that the SAB would
like to do more this year than they

The SAB ended last year with a
$7,000 surplus after spending $3,000
on FD bills. Duwel said that the SAB
is asking the Executive Committee

to Washington and Lee’s Coordinator

The lot has been closed off since
August while workers removed a few
,. old trees, re-constructed the entrance
and put in new curbing in order to
"maximize the amount of parking area
‘available. The effort should provide
for about 19 extra parking spaces,
Parsons said.

the lot. So it’s not exactly like just
digging 19 extra spaces at the end of
the lot,’’ he said.

The project involved the use of
heavy earth-moving and paving ma-
chines. Parsons said $74,000 has been
budgeted for the new spaces.

The newly-expanded lot will be
open to any students with ‘*C’’ park-
ing stickers and will now be able to
accomodate at least 94 cars, Parsons
said. The adjoining Lee Chapel park-
ing lot, which holds about 15 cars,
will remain designated for staff and
visitors.

Parsons said the expansion of the
Corral was done as ‘‘a good faith
effort’’ on the part of W&L in con-
junction with the Fraternity Renais-
sance program. He said the university
wants to provide as much off-street

      

parking as possible for members of
the five Red Square fraternity houses
which are now under construction, as
well as for Sigma Chi members,
whose house is scheduled to begin
renovation in December.

According to Parsons, those houses
are not bound to a Lexington City
ordinance requiring a fraternity to
provide one off-street parking space
for every bed in the house because
they are located in a Historical Dis-
trict.

Members of some of the Red
Square houses and Sigma Chi who
were not allowed to have ‘‘C’’ park-
ing stickers in the past have been
issued the stickers this year so they
can use the Corral lot, Parsons said.

According to EC Representative
for the SAB Clayton Kennington, the
EC has not thoroughly discussed the
appropriation of its $185,000 budget
yet. Concerning the SAB’s prelimi-
nary budget request Kennington re-
marked, ‘‘I don’t know exactly what
our stance will be this year.”

Both Duwel and Kennington said
they are optimistic about the two
relationship between SAB and EC
this year.

“I’m just trying to set down the
guidelines quickly,’’ said Duwel.
“Last year was a growing year and
for cleaning out old habits. I don’t
think that there is any animosity bet-
ween the EC and SAB.”’

Kennington said the last SAB

ciently. ‘‘I really commend Katie and
her committee. I don’t foresee any
problems between the SAB and EC,”’
he added.

EC awaits
requests
for money

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

 

EC Vice President Raymond Wel-
der announced he would release this
week a tentative budget allocation
hearing schedule for student organiza-
tions.

The EC will hear budget requests
next week and deliberate final deci-
sions the following week.

Welder expressed concern over the
hearings in the wake of many budget
cuts last fall. The 1988-89 Student
Activities Board debt of more than
$20,000 contributed to last year’s
need for tighter purse strings. Weld-
er said he fears that organizations
will consequently bloat their requests
this year, a practice against which he
advises.

“I encourage all organization
representatives to. show us what they,
need, nothing more, nothing less,”’
said Welder. He explained that the
EC will be more likely to grant a
request that seems reasonable than
one that seems exaggerated.

The schedule will be posted and
distributed to student organizations.
Welder said that organizations wish-
ing to add or change the time of their
budget hearing should contact him at
463-8588.

The Executive Committee opened
the year Monday night with a brief
meeting disclosing deadlines in other
upcoming business.

Applications for Student Activi-
ties Board operations director and law
school publicity representative; Fancy
Dress chairman, vice chairman and
auditor; and Mock Convention secre-
tary are available in the University
Center and due 5 p.m. Monday.

Petition forms to run for fresh-
man EC representative will be avail-
able in the University Center on Sept.
24, due Oct. 1 for an Oct. 8 election.

Student center construction
to begin in spring of 1992

 

By John Laney
Staff Reporter

 

The spring of 1992 would be the
earliest starting point for construction
on Washington and Lee’s new stu-
dent center, said Robert Akins, as-
sociate professor of engineering.

The student center, part of W&L’s
Master Plan, will require about two
years of construction time.

Akins and Leroy Atkins, associate
dean of students, are the chairman
and assistant chairman of the yet-to-
be-completed planning committee for
the center.

‘‘Nothing is a give in yet,’’ At-
kins said. ‘‘We’re discussing the
process by which we should proceed
along. We’ve got to work this all out
and keep the students involved.’’

“This year will be spent with on-
campus planning and the selection of

an architect,’ Akins said.

A projected location for the new
center is across the parking lot from
the Graham-Lees dormitory and the
C-School.

‘‘We’re not exactly sure how or
where, but we want it in a central
location,’ Atkins said.

While the center will have a bet-
ter bookstore and snack bar, Akins
stressed that it will be ‘‘more than

just a Co-op.”
“*The key to it is a meeting place
for students and student organ-

izations — a place for social interac-
tion on campus,’’ Akins said.

‘*We want it so every student has
a reason to go there every day,”’
Atkins added. ‘‘We want the center
to provide whatever any student
needs.”’

As a central resource for the
campus, the center will contain loun-
ges, offices for student organizations

and a mail room for campus com-
munication, which might also be used
for U.S. mail and UPS pickup and
delivery.

Atkins estimated the usable space
of the center to be 40,000 square
feet.

The Co-op will probably be
remodeled as additional classroom
and office space for the C-School and
the University Registrar. The space in
the current University Center may be
shared between the dining hall, the
Career Development and Placement
Office and the administration, Atkins
said.

Akins and Atkins spent four days
during August gathering ideas for the
center by visiting schools similar to
W&L in size and philosophy that
have good student centers. The pair
travelled to Hiram College, the
College of Wooster, Ohio Wesleyan,
Denison and Wittenberg.

Old George full of tales

 

By Ashley Harper
Entertainment Editor

For approximately 150 years high
atop Washington Hall, Old George

 

greeted students and faculty every 4

day and therefore has been an ideal |!

tool in statements or for pranks.
Courageous pranksters have found

ways to ascend to Old George's j

watchful perch 120 feet in the air in
order tO  omament the _ statue.
Washington and Lee Director of

Communications Brian Shaw said

‘‘George has always been decorated,
painted and has had things hung on
him.’’

In the past, George has wom a
cap and gown, has held a lacrosse
stick and has been painted by Vir-
ginia Military Institute students. The
two campus crew teams [the Albert-
Sydney and the Harry-Lee] would
alternate painting George different
colors each night leading up to their
big regatta.

In 1976, in order of United States
bicentenial patriotic _ celebrations,
George was painted red, white and
blue and wore a top hat. During one
Fancy Dress, George was adored in
a top hat and wore a cape. A VMI
cap and cape have also been found
with the statue.

The co-education issue years ago
inspired someone to attempt to put a
skirt on old George. The statue also
has held a sign that said ‘‘No Mar-
tha’s’’ to speak against co-education.

This piece of folk art, carved in
1842 out of a pine log found in the
Maury river, has come to represent
the spirit and tradition of W&L.
Branco Medenica, sculpture in charge
of the statue’s restoration, told the
Birmingham Post-Herald, ‘‘It’s just a
folk pieces of art, but to the folks at
W&L it means everything.’’

Old George was removed April
17, after keeping watch on the cam-
pus and Lexington for approximately
150 years. Shaw said, ‘‘The first
couple of days after they took him
down, it made you stop. Now I don’t
stop anymore, but it looks strange.’’

Lexington Cabinet Maker Mat-
thew Kahle, carved Old George and
it was placed on top of Washington
Hall in 1844, The statue has been
deteriorating due to the weather and

 

oe
oe neers

practical jokes since.

Medenica told Birmingham Post
Herald, ‘‘It’s amazing what a jigsaw
puzzle this all is. There's‘ pieces if
concrete and wood putty, pieces of
all kinds of stuff used through the
years to sort of patch things up.
There was even a pair of boxer
shorts stuffed in his head.’’

After Medenica stripped approx-
imately 120 coats of paint, he found

__George had been subjected to rotted

_City ponders

 

 

The city of Lexington, in an attempt to solve its
parking problem, is considering the construction of a
parking garage near the Washington and Lee campus.

At a Sept. 6 meeting, the Lexington City Council
reviewed an architecture firm’s solution to the parking
problems that plague the streets around campus — a three-
story parking deck near W&L.

The deck would be constructed in the interior of the
block bordered by Nelson, Jefferson, Washington and Lee
streets with exits on Jefferson and Lee. The deck, de-
signed by the firm of Marcellis, Wright, Cox, and Smith

 

parking plan

of Richmond, would hold 152 cars.

“There are times when parking is very difficult
downtown,’’ said Lexington interim City Manager David
Woody when asked why the study was requested. Lexing-
ton’s former City Manager Joe King resigned this summer
to become city manager for Richland, Wash.

‘A lot of students try to park as close as they can to
campus. A parking deck may be the answer,’’ Woody
said.

A major problem with the plan, according to Woody,
is the price tag. The construction estimate offered by the
architects is about $2.3 million, which does not include
land acquisition or the demolition of one entire building
and part of another which would be required. Woody said
the budget this year is close to $11 million.

Counselors change focus

 

By Craig Burke
Staff Reporter

 

In a move that is expected to
better serve Washington and Lee
students, the peer counseling program
will replace its telephone hotline with
a service in the Student Health Cen-
ter.

University Psychologist Dr. James
Worth said a peer counselor will be
available at the health services desk
in the infirmary each day between 6
p.m. and 8 p.m. The counselors will
aid those students in the infirmary by
running errands, reading books and
magazines, or simply listening to
problems.

“This service is an attempt to
expand the peer counselor’s role in

such a way as to better serve the
student body,’’ Worth said. ‘‘The
counselors will be contributing to
mental health by creating a healthy
atmosphere.”’

Head peer counselor Mary An-
stine, who has been involved with the
program for two years, agrees that
the service contributes to mental
health.

‘‘The peer counseling program is
an outlet for students who do not
need professional counseling,’ said
Anstine. ‘‘These people just need to
talk.”’

Worth implemented the peer coun-
seling program at W&L three years
ago after attending several workshops
and seeing the success of similar
programs at other universities.

“‘T saw students who were going

through periods of stress or even
distress, but they did not wish to
seek professional counseling,’’ said
Worth. ‘‘Peer counselors are safe
people to talk to, people with special
training. The program is not meant to
be psychotherapy. It is an opportunity
to talk to someone who will really
listen.”’

There are currently twenty-five
peer counselors at W&L who are
chosen on the basis of their social
skills, maturity, common sense, com-
mitment and responsibility. After
being picked for the program, the
counselors attend intensive training
sessions throughout the year.

Students interested in becoming
peer counselors can pick up applica-
tions from Carol Calkins in the Uni-
versity Center during winter term.

Mathis heads Live Drive

 

By Chris Bray
Staff Reporter

 

Live Drive enters a pivotal year
this year with great enthusiasm and
many new faces.

Live Drive, a group of student
volunteers committed to providing
safe, sober transportation for the
Washington and Lee community,
faces an important year of transition
according to new Live Drive Presi-
dent Stephen Mathis.

“‘There’s a changing of the guard
taking place within Live Drive,”’ said

Mathis, who was the organization’s
secretary last year. ‘‘Younger people
are being brought in to help insure
that Live Drive lives on.”’
Concerned with the possibility that
Live Drive might graduate with those
individuals in the class of '91 who
have been instrumental in the organi-
zation since its birth in 1988, Mathis
needed to find some new blood and
is encouraged with the early results.
““We should have a really good
year,’’ said Mathis, who was excited
over the many unfamiliar faces in
attendance and the willingness to
contribute displayed at Monday’s

Live Drive meeting
Auditorium.

Mathis’ Live Drive goals for the
1990-91 year are to find more coor-
dinators, people that supervise the
call in service on the weekends, and
to develop a good relationship with
the IFC.

Live Drive will begin operation
this weekend with its regular hours,
10 p.m. - 2 a.m. Friday and Saturday
nights. The number to call for a
sober ride is 463-8947.

Those interested in becoming a
Live Drive member may contact
Mathis at 464-3708.

Generals drop thriller to E&H

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

Emory & Henry 22, Washington
& Lee 21. So close yet so far.

It is a simple cliche, but one that
sums up last Saturday afternoon’s
football game between Old Dominion
Athletic Conference foes E&H and
W&L on Wilson Field.

The Generals came into the game
heavy underdogs, having been picked
fifth in the conference while the
Wasps were once again picked to
finish first.

The main question being asked
around Wilson Field was not about
the outcome of the game, but about
would direct the W&L attack.

While answering the latter ques-
tion, the Generals nearly sent more
than 5,000 fans home with a win that
no one expected. Well, almost no
one.

“‘No one gave us much of a
chance but ourselves,’’ said W&L

_ head coach Gary Fallon. ‘‘We gave it

everything we had, but it just wasn’t
enough.”’

With junior quarterback George
Sakin making his first collegiate start
after learning from the graduated
Phillip Sampson and Chris Smythe
for two years, and with All-American
Craig Irons returning at split end,
expectations would be for Sakin to
pick up where Sampson and Smythe

left off, throwing the ball with a
great deal of success.

Trailing 14-0 and struggling, the
W&L offense started to click and
went on its first sustained drive of
the day. Starting from its own 27, the
Generals drove 64 yards and used
9:03 off the clock. On third and four
from the W&L 34, Sakin hit senior
fullback Kirk Sohonage for a gain of
six and a first down.

After a penalty gave W&L the
ball on the E&H 40, the Generals
faced a fourth and six on the 36.
Sakin calmly stepped up in the pock-
et and hit Irons for a gain of 12 and
a first down. Two plays later Soho-
nage carried tacklers for 11 yards and
another first down to the E&H seven.

After a sack and a defensive
holding penalty, W&L had a first and
goal at the five. Sakin looked for a
wide open Tyler Suiters in the end
zone, but the senior slot back
couldn’t hang on, and the Generals
settled for a 26 yard field goal from
senior Carter Quayle to make it 14-
a:

After forcing an E&H punt, the
Generals got one more chance to
move the ball before halftime, but
they needed to go 91 yards in 50
seconds. On the first play, senior
tailback Mason Pope carried on what
looked to be a routine handoff up the
middle. Pope broke through the line
into the secondary, cut out to the left
sideline and rambled 56 yards to the

into the locker room down 14-6.

Midway through the third quarter,
the W&L defense forced E&H to
punt. Starting from its own 11, the
W&L offense went to work behind
Sakin. On second down, Sakin hi:

Sakin calmly hit Irons for 27
yards to the 27 of E&H for another
first down, and after Sakin bulled his
way for four yards on third down,
the Generals had first down at the
E&H 16 as the third quarter expired.

On the first play of the final quar-
ter, Sakin, who had completed five of
his last six passes after missing on
his first four attempts, hit paydirt. He
went up top with a timing pattern to
the comer of the end zone, where
Irons made a diving catch in double
coverage. Down 14-12, the Generals

Volleyball opens
season with split

 

By Chris Simon
Staff Reporter

 

This could be the year. In just
the third year since being started as a
club sport, Washington and Lee
women’s volicyball is standing at the
doorstep of Old Dominion Athletic
Conference competition hoping to
become the third team in ODAC
history to capture the tournament
crown.

The Generals opened the season
with fourteen other teams at the
Haverford Tournament. W&L
finished sixth with a record of 3-3,
with wins coming over Ursinus, Cab-
rini, and Allentown.

Washington and Lee the
tournament with a 15-5, 15-1 thrash-
ing of Cabrini before falling 15-11,
15-6 to Amherst. In the third match,
the Generals met Allentown in a duel
which may indicate that this team has
indeed arrived. Down one game and
trailing 12-3 in the second, W&L
rallied with thirteen straight points to
win 15-12. The third and final game,
a 16-14 nailbiter, gave the Generals a

come-from-behind victory.

With senior star and 1989 first
team All-ODAC selection Lisa Jay
unable to compete due to injury, the
Generals were having trouble with
their setting game. As game two of
the Allentown match fell before her
eyes, Dittman called on sophomore
B.J. League, a back-up setter to spark
the team. League responded with
nine assists as W&L rolled on to
victory.

League went on to record a team-
high 47 assists for the remainder of
the tournament. Still, without the
gifted Jay, the Generals suffered a

in their attack percentage which
dropped to .141.

Rounding out the team’s arsenal
was junior Mena McGowin, who has
changed positions this year, and soph-
omore Leslie Hess, collecting 27 and
24 kills respectively.

Despite dropping two of their
final three matches to Wilmington
and Catholic, the Generals showed
that they can run with what Dittman
considers strong Division III competi-
tion.

Polo set to swim

 

From W&L Sports Information

 

Nine lettermen and five of last
year’s top six scorers return to the
water this fall for Page Remillard’s
twelfth season at Washington and
Lee, and the veteran mentor says if a
few pieces fit together, 1990 could be
even more eventful than 1989.

That’s saying something.

The 1989 Generals got off to the
best start ever for a W&L polo team
when they won their first 11 contests.
The 21-7 final record included a state
title, a second-place finish in the
Southem Championships and a bergh
in the all-important Eastern Champi-
onships.

Remillard has the same set of
goals in mind for his squad this year,
and with a healthy load of proven
performers returning, all of those

goals could be within reach. The .

. “From an athletic standpoint this
could be a very exciting year,’’ said
Remillard, who brings a career .686
winning percentage to his twelfth
season at the W&L helm. ‘‘There
should be an awful lot of healthy
competition for playing time. We
have a young but talented team.”’

Included in that talented group of
returnees are all-state players Alan
Herrick and Tomas Perez. Herrick
and Perez are joined by 28-game
starter Will Davis as returning start-
ers. Herrick, Davis and Perez were
third, fourth, and fifth in scoring last
year, while the trio also accounted for
a combined total of 136 steals.

Even more comforting for Remil-
lard is the return of Scott Strader,
who as a freshman led W&L in goals
per game in ’89. Strader’s proven
production level should secure him at
the two-meter position. Others ex-
pected to contribute include senior

senior Jim Dunlevy, who had 16

goals in ’89 and sophomore Chris

Hagge, who scored 12 times last fall.

drawn even at 14-14.

After E&H missed a field goal,
the Generals regained possession at
their own 20. On first down, junior
Jeff Kreis carried on a reverse for 17
yards. Sakin hit Irons on successive
plays for gains of seven yards, mov-
ing the ball to the E&H 49,

After Pope carried for a gain of
three, the Generals went deep. Sakin
led Kreis perfectly and the speedy
slotback never broke stride, outrun-
ning the E&H secondary to the end
zone and a 21-14 Generals lead.

“‘As the game went along, George
really started to click. He had a feel
for what was happening out there,”’
said Fallon. ‘‘He threw some passes
that couldn’t be thrown any better.’

After trading punts, E&H drove
again. From their own 18, the Wasps
used nine plays to get to the W&L
seven yard line. But the defense rose
to the occasion again. Junior John
McCallum stripped Verran as he went
through the line and sophomore Paul
Mallos fell on the ball at the W&L
19 with 1:36 left.

Trying to kill the clock, the Gen-
erals ran three plays and forced E&H
to use all of their timeouts. On fourth
and 12 from the 18, Fallon ordered
punter Bob Ehret to take a safety to
avoid blocking a punt, making the
score 21-16. ‘‘I think it was the
smart thing to do. We wanted them

to earn a score, not get one by block-
ing a kick and getting a cheap one,”
said Fallon.

Ehret’s free kick after the safety
was retumed by Perkins to the W&L
40, where the Wasps had 30 seconds
to score and no time outs. On first
down Walker hit Perkins for 14 yards
to the 26. And after three straight
incompletions, E&H had a fourth
down with seven seconds left.

Walker sent three receivers to the
right side, and a fourth, Todd Wood-
all was supposed to go that way. But
he stayed on the left side and broke
open for a split second. Walker spot-
ted Woodall just before being hit by
junior Greg Kiehl. Woodall caught
the ball and fell into the end zone as
time expired, and the Wasps cele-
brated before a stunned W&L team
and 5,087 Wilson Field spectators.

“It was a nice catch. The throw
was right where it had to be,”’ said
Fallon. ‘‘It was an unbelievable fin-
ish.

“I’ve never had a group try hard-
er than they did. We just wanted
anything but for the game to be
over.”’

The Generals will look to rebound
Saturday at Methodist College. The
game will be broadcast on 91.5
WLUR-FM and 1450 WREL-AM.
Kickoff is at 1:00.

Women’s soccer gets
two wins by shutout

 

By John Laney
Associate Sports Editor

 

The Washington and Lee women’s
soccer team began the 1990 season
with victories over Gettysburg Col-
lege and Sweet Briar.

In their opening game against
Gettysburg at Liberty Hall Field on
Saturday, the Generals earned a 1-0
win.

Junior Katie Seeman registered
W&L’s lone goal after stealing the
ball and scoring from 10 yards away.
Freshman goaltender Katie Stimeling
made eight saves as she recorded her
first collegiate shutout.

Head coach Janine Hathorn said
she was pleased with Saturday's
game.

‘*We really came a long way in
one game. It was really fun to watch
the team gel over 90 minutes. It gave
me a lot of confidence,’’ she said.

Yesterday, at Sweet Briar, two
second half goals gave W&L a 2-0
victory.

Freshman Corinda Hankins scored
an unassisted goal with just under
seven minutes remaining in the con-
test and senior Kathi Moritz had an
unassisted goal of her own in the
final minute.

W&L outshot SBC 31 to 1.

Stimeling, with one save, registcr-
ed another shoutout.

W&L's 2-0 record is the best start
in the program’s four-year history.

The Generals will host Guilford
on Saturday and visit Virginia Wes-
leyan next Thursday.

History says it's W&L’s turn
to bring home league titles

 

From W&L Sports Information

It would be quite natural for the
Washington and Lee men’s and
women’s cross country teams to win
respective Old Dominion Athletic
Conference championships this year.

Fueling such a hypothesis are a
few important facts. More than a
dozen proven runners return to Lex-
ington this fall to perform for W&L.
Both the men’s and women’s teams
are coming off winning seasons in
1989 and the women posted their best
mark ever with a 5-2 mark.

Beyond these important prerequi-
sites however is the Generals’ recent
historical progression. Both teams
finished third in the ODAC Champi-
onships in 1988. They followed that
up with second-place finishes in the
1989 conference meet. Certainly the
natural progression would have the
W&L men and women raising the
championship plaque in 1990.

If only it were that easy. Both
men’s head coach John Tucker and
women’s head coach Jim Phemister
know it won’t be. But both see their

respective squads having a right to
claim some title aspirations.

Both coaches have reason to feel
good about their returning talent. Six
lettermen return to the men’s team,
and while the Generals will miss the
consistency of graduated Joe Geitner,
there are plenty of horses in the
stable ready to fill the void.

Junior Charles Edwards was
W&L’s top runner in 1989 and is
back after leading W&L runners in
four different races last fall. He
finished tenth in the ODAC Charpi-
onships.

Behind Edwards is a_ talented
group of runners, any of which could
lead W&L at any time this season.

The women have even more depth
than the men with seven letterwinners
from last year returning to compete
this fall. On top of that list is veter-
an Cecily Tynan, who led W&L
runners in all seven races she ran last
season. Tynan, who won four races
outright, will be backed up by anoth-
er proven veteran senior Shawn Wert,
who was right behind Tynan in six
races last year and finished first for
W&L in one race.

The Ring-tum Phi, September 13, 1990

 

Time’s Up for Living Colour

 

By Andrew Keller
Staff Reporter

 

Having waited three years for
Living Colour’s latest release, Time's
Up, the title is rather appropriate.
However, considering the number of
bands that fall prey to the sophomore
jinx, it’s encouraging when groups
take enough time to produce quality
rather than a one-week wonder.

Wisely not changing a good thing,
Living Colour has kept their original
producer, Ed Stasium. By doing so,
the huge Zeppelinesque sound is still
present but at the same time they've
begun stretching themselves in dif-
ferent directions musically and lyri-
cally.

While songs like Pride and Type
sound eerily like they may have
appeared on Vivid, the album’s open-
er and title track will take some by
surprise. With its thrash/hardcore
origins, let’s just say it gets the lis-
teners attention as well as the list of
guest performers: Little Richard,
Maceo Parker, Mick Jagger, and
Queen Latifah to name a few.

Although all the players on the
album are exceptional, no_ per-
formance outshines that of guitar
wizard Vernon Reid. Burnin’ Vernon

seems to have loosed any chains that
may have held him back on the first
record. Carefully employing the use
of dissonant seventh, minor seven
sharp nine, sixth and ninth chords
with innovative intertwining melodies,
Reid continues his pursuit for the
unknown. Have no fear speed fans,
Reid also uses many of his trademark
scaler runs that often move in and
out of key.

While much of the black message
these days is being preached by rap-
pers like Public Enemy, Living
Colour has continued to fight the
fight in a funk/rock/metal format.
This can be seen on one of this
record’s best tracks, Elvis is Dead.
The lyrics prove to be difficult to
understand because of the many pot-
ential interpretations they lend them-
self to. For the most part, the lyrics
seem to be anti-Elvis for two reasons.
The first seems to stem from Vernon
Reid’s belief that a black man taught
Elvis how to sing and yet Elvis gets
all the credit.

The second reason Reid would
like Elvis forgotten is because of his
and many others’ belief that Presley
was a racist. At first Vernon Reid
attempts to avoid this concept by
quoting the Public Enemy line, ‘'‘-
Elvis was a hero to most’, and

rather than completing it with the PE
line, ‘‘Straightout racist,’ Reid opts
for, ‘‘But that’s beside the point.”’
However later Reid twists a line by
Paul Simon, into, ‘‘I’ve got a reason
to believe we all won't be received at
Graceland,’’ showing his continuing
concer towards Elvis as a racist.

Another facet of the song sur-
faces with a small rap in the middle
of the piece by Little Richard. Un-
like Reid, Richard praises Elvis
saving condemnation for those that
try to make money off of his fame.
Obviously this song is full of poten-
tial messages, unfortunately the clarity
is blurred by contradiction.

Another fine song very different
from anything on Vivid is Fight the
Fight. Its opening line is, ‘‘We all
are fighting the same fight.’’ In this
line ‘‘we’’ could be the black popula-
tion or the whole world, it’s really
impossible to know. At the same
time, ‘‘the fight’’ could be black
man’s struggle for equality or every-
one’s struggle for survival. Regard-
less, its main point is for the union
of ideals which allows for anyone
who believes in the fight to fight it.
The best line comes when Glover
sings, ‘‘You got to know what you’re
fighting for’’, which calls for know-
ledge of the issues and action that

will make a difference, both of which
seem to be missing from current
society.

The most intriguing songs on the
album would have to be the instru-
mental Ology and the closing track
This is the Life. Ology is all bass
except for the obvious drum loop. It
showcases Muzz Skillings’s innova-
tive bass playing as he layers many
tracks of unrelated parts to end up
with an odd jazzy piece.

This Is The Life ends out the
album with a Jane’s Addiction/-
Kashmir-ish hypnotic sound. While
it carries the age old message of
bloom where you are planted, its tone
is not quite as soothing as one might
expect. Rather, it tends to condemn
those that spend their time making
excuses for not doing well in life. A
message worthwhile for everyone to
hear.

While this album is not quite as
ready for the airwaves as their first
was, it has many great songs. In my
opinion it is a fine follow up to
Vivid and definitely one of the best
new releases on the market. Having
surmounted what many believe to be
the most difficult task, creation of a
strong second album, it seems we
may now expect great things from
this original band.

Patterson found by Supermarket

 

By Ashley Harper
Entertainment Editor

 

Lost in the Supermarket has found
a new lead singer.

Bryan Patterson, a senior eco-
nomics major, had his debut perfor-
mance with the Washington and Lee
student band on Saturday at the Kap-
pa Alpha fraternity house. However,
this wasn’t Patterson’s first musical
performance. He has had a history of
musical involvement.

Toward the end of Patterson’s
sophomore year in high school in
Shreveport, LA, he and four of his
friends formed a band called Critical
Mass for which Patterson sang lead
vocals. Two years later, after grad-
uation, Critical Mass was playing
night clubs in downtown Shreveport.

Patterson, at W&L, became inter-

ested in the choral groups his fresh-
man year when he joined the Glee
Club. The next year he joined
University Chorus and Southern Com-
fort as well. Last year, Patterson
arranged and sang Tenor solo for the
song Caravan of Love, originally
done by the Isle Brothers and re-
made by the House Martins.
Patterson said, ‘‘When singing in
a band, you must put more effort into
the performance, and it is much more
tiring. In Southern Comfort, a better
trained voice is of greater importance
than in a band. The length of the
performances with the band as well
as the intensity and volume of the
music we play incidentally strains the
voice more than in a chorus. In a
chorus you sing one certain musical
range, whereas in a band, sometimes
you must sing a wider voice range.
Although showmanship and stage

rea o td

presence is required in Southern
Comfort, more is needed in a band.’’
In 1988, Patterson’s freshman
ear, Lost in the Supermarket was
i rmed and played at various frater-
nity parties on campus. The next
year, lead guitarist David Klabo,
aware of Patterson’s previous band
experience, suggested the band ask
Patterson to run the sound system at
various functions. Patterson worked
the PA and also filled in for previous
lead singer Lee Fleming ’90, when
Fleming was unable to sing due to
sickness or prior engagements.
Keyboardist and guitarist Niko
Lorentzatos, who handles most of the
band’s business, approached Patterson
before he left with the University
Chorus for Italy Spring Break 1990
and to spend last Spring Term in

London. : :

what has been thought of as a KA
band. Patterson said, ‘‘When the
band was formed, Niko Lorentzatos,
Matt Stover and Bob Fuller knew
each other through KA and now they
live together so they knew each
other’s abilities. They didn’t find a
KA and teach him to play guitar.
Klabo [Sigma Nu ’89] plays guitar. I
guess it is a wide misconception that
Lost in the- Supermarket is a KA
band. I always knew the band mem-
bers and didn’t think of it as a KA
band. It was a natural progression for
me to take over for Fleming.’’

The band members include Patter-
son on lead vocals, Lorentzatos on
keyboards and guitar, Klabo on lead
guitar, Stover on drums, and Fuller
on bass. The band will be playing at
Sweet Briar Sept. 29 and many other
times this fall, so keep a look out to
find Lost in the Supermarket.
