Goodbye,
Sandwiches;
it's pasta time

By Joshua Manning

The changing palate of Lexington shifted again last
week as one restaurant closed and another celebrated its
grand opening.

Sycamore Farms food store and restaurant closed its
Lexington location during Thanksgiving break. The
Randolph Street shop had been a popular eatery since its
opening three years ago.

According to proprietor Bruce Becker, ‘‘Sycamore
Farms formally shifted its base of operations to their
Blacksburg location last week.”’

“‘We did this with a great deal of reluctance,’’ Becker
said. ‘‘We had a nice small business up here, but
Blacksburg is a much larger city. Down there, there is
a student population of over 26,000. We only have
resources enough for one city.’’

Becker also pointed out that the ‘‘summer doldrums”’
hit Lexington much harder than Blacksburg. Between
8,000 and 10,000 students study at Blacksburg’s Virginia
Tech during the summer months.

The Blacksburg store opened in January 1990 and has
steadily picked up momentum, according to Becker. The
decision to completely relocate was finally made three
weeks ago. Becker felt that the change would be easier
if it was unannounced.

“IT want to make it perfectly clear that we have
always appreciated our association with the Washington

‘ and Lee student body over the past years. This is why

the move was taken with such reluctance,’’ Becker said.

Also over break, Lexington’s new restaurant of ‘‘fine
Italian cuisine’ opened its doors to the public. (Review
on page 8.)

According to owner Ugo Benincasa, last Monday’s
grand opening was a great success. ‘‘Il Palazzo has
received a very warm reception here in Lexington,’’ said
Benincasa.

The restaurant is usually full during the dinner rush.
For that reason, Benincasa recommended that patrons
make reservations.

Benincasa feels that his inexpensive Italian specialties

, such as New York style pizza, calzone, stuffed pizza, and

submarine sandwiches will
Washington and Lee students.

Il Palazzo also serves a complete dinner menu. Dinner
specialties include a wide variety of seafood dishes. The
seafood platters, a personal favorite of Benincasa, have
been the biggest sellers so far.

Il Palazzo is located at 24 N. Main Street, next door
to the Willson-Walker House.

‘Lean on Me’
subject to
give lecture

Joe Clark to

speak during

Black History Month

 

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

 

The Contact Committee will con-
tract this week with former New
Jersey high school principal Joe Clark
to visit Washington and Lee on Feb.
11 as a Black History Month speaker,
Contact Chairman Charles Kranich
announced Monday night at the Ex-
ecutive Committee meeting.

Clark, whose story was chroni-
cled by the movie ‘‘Lean on Me,”’ is
known as the principal who ‘‘got
tough’’ with the students of Eastside
High School in Paterson, N.J.

The EC granted an additional
$4,500 Contact requested Monday for
Clark’s $6,500 fee and expenses.

Kranich said that although that
price is higher than that is usually
paid for most Contact guests,‘‘his
reputation as such a dynamic speak-
er’’ made the cost worthwhile in the
opinion of the Committee.

Kranich said Minority Student
Association President James Rambeau
and Vice President Damon Sanders
chose Clark from a number of pos-
sible speakers for Black History
Month. MSA will cosponsor Clark’s
appearance, but Contact will cover all
expenses, as the EC had previously
recommended.

Kranich said that Clark’s speech,
‘From Disgrace to Amazing Grace,’’
will probably discuss Clark’s views
on education, especially in inner
Cities.

When Clark was appointed the
principal of Eastside High School in
New Jersey in 1982, it was a haven
for illegal drugs, graffiti, and violent
crime, according to a Time magazine
article that featured Clark on Feb. 1,

1988.

In his first six years, his con-
troversial means of discipline helped
clean up Eastside. Under Clark the
school expelled over 500 students
who Clark called ‘‘leeches and para-
sites,’’ according to Time. A base-
ball bat and a bullhom became sym-
bols of Clark’s enforcement of school
policy.

Despite disputes with the school
board, a threat of dismissal, and the
tumover of more than 100 faculty,
Clark was commended by President
Ronald Reagan and U.S. Secretary of
Education William Bennett, reported
Time. The television show ‘‘60
Minutes’’ sought Clark’s story and
Warner Bros. Inc. purchased it for
the movie version.

Jet magazine reported in July
1989 that Clark was suspended from
Eastside after ‘‘scantily clad dancers
.. appeared at the school while the
administrator was out of town.’
Clark announced then that he would
leave his job for a lecture tour.

Kranich said that the promotional
material on Clark included ‘‘a stack’’
of ‘‘very positive’ written recom-
mendations from other schools.
‘Most big names only come with a
few (recommendations),’’ he said.

EC Vice President Raymond Wel-
der motioned to make the allocation
Monday night, saying that Clark
“‘should pack Lee Chapel.’’

Third-year EC law Rep. Mark
Cobb voted against the allocation
with senior EC Rep. John Fialcowitz.

Kranich said Contact normally
signs big name speakers when they
are available through special offers.

‘I’m distressed when a speaker
comes ... at full price, and no ‘co-
ntacts’ are being used,’’ said Cobb.

Best-selling author, political col-
umnist, and self-proclaimed
‘‘gonzo’’ journalist Hunter §. Thom-
pson is scheduled to speak in Lee
Chapel on Tuesday at 8 p.m. in an
appearance sponsored by Contact.

Thompson, who has been noted
for his stream-of-consciousness writ-
ing style, entered the world of jour-
nalism in 1959 with a one-year stay
at Time magazine as Caribbean cor-
respondent. Later, his work was
featured in the New York Herald

Tribune, the National Observer, The

Nation and Ramparts.
In addition, Thompson _ served
as the national affairs editor for

Rolling Stone from 1970 to 1981

oe

and has contributed to High Times
as a global affairs correspondent

Performances to go on in |

Also known as an originator of
the ‘‘gonzo’’ style of New Jour-
nalism, Thompson describes it as
“the art of imposing a novelistic
form on journalistic content.”’

Thompson’s literary career also
includes a number of books, beginn-
ing with ‘‘Hell’s Angels’’ (1966),
an inside look at America’s most
notorious motorcycle gang. His sec-
ond book, ‘‘Fear and Loathing in
Las Vegas’’ (1972), was an account
of a district attorneys’ convention.
Other works to his credit include
“The Great Shark Hunt’’ (1977),
“The Curse of Lona’’ (1981), and
‘‘Songs of the Doomed’’ (1990).

Thompson has also served as an
inspiration for the movie ‘‘Where
the Buffalo Roam’’ and may be
observed as the model for Uncle
Duke in Gary Trudeau’s comic

 

John Vincent
Atanasoff

 

By Craig Burke
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee Professor of
Journalism Clark R. Mollenhoff
attended an awards ceremony at the
White House on Tuesday, Nov. 13,
to honor Dr. John Vincent Atanasoff
with a Presidential Medal of
Technology for his invention of the
first electronic computer.

The publication of Mollenhoff’s
“‘Atanasoff: Forgotten Father of the
Computer’’ brought to the public’s
attention the fact that Atanasoff, a
professor at Iowa State University,
not John Mauchly, was the rightful
creator of the first computer.

Mauchly visited Atanasoff at Iowa
State in 1941, at which time he saw
the electronic digital computer that

 

 

strip, ‘‘Doonsebury.”’

 

Atanasoff and a graduate student,

ceremony to hail computer inventor

Clifford E. Berry, had constructed
two years earlier. This computer was
notable for its use of a base-two
binary format, the possibility of input
and output, a system that held
modifiable data and a memory. After
his visit, Mauchly returned home and
began planning the construction of
ENIAC, a computer based on the
Atanasoff-Berry model.

Mauchly enlisted the aid of
electronics expert Presper Eckert and
built ENIAC between 1943 and 1946.
The two men then sold the ENIAC
rights to the Sperry Rand Corp.

For years Mauchly and Eckert
were thought to be the inventors of
the first computer. But in 1973 a
U.S. District Court ruled that the
concepts behind ENIAC had been
derived from the Atanasoff-Berry
computer,

Mollenhoff wrote an article on

Atanasoff for The (Des Moines)
Sunday Register in January 1974.
Unable to describe the whole
complex string of events effectively
in a newspaper article, Mollenhoff
wrote ‘‘Atanasoff: Forgotten Father of
the Computer’’ in 1988.

Despite the Court ruling and the
publication of Mollenhoff’s book,
Atanasoff failed to receive public
recognition. Only through the efforts
of Mollenhoff, Iowa State officials
and Towa legislators have
encyclopedias and museums finally
acknowledged Atanasoff as _ the
inventor of the first computer.

Mollenhoff said he was thrilled by
the presentation. ‘‘It was totally and
thoroughly gratifying to see Dr.
Atanasoff accept his medal. I feel this
is a full victory for Atanasoff and for
those who have attempted to give
him the recognition he deserves.’’

the new preforming arts center’s grand

Washington and Lee Professor of Fine

longer to finish than the rest of the center.

“I’m hoping everything inside will be

house should be done about a month later.’’

Wiseman said when the first concert is
held, though, the interior might still have
some work to be done on it.

‘There might be a couple of areas that
won't be 100 percent,’’ he said. ‘‘We’ll just
be putting in some carpet and a little bit of

MY VIEW

Congress recently passed a sweep-
ing housing reform bill, the first such
bill in 16 years. However, the hous-

$27.5 billion for the next fiscal year,
was almost killed because of the
matter of the design of a few coins.

The Senate tacked on a provision
requiring the federal mint to redesign
the backs of all pennies, nickels,
dimes, quarters and half dollars. The
added provision so enraged several
House members that they were will-
ing to cut out the coin language from
the bill, which would have left it
open to more amendments in the Sen-
ate, and would likely have killed the
bill.

It was only after House Banking
Chairman Henry Gonzales told the
sponsor of the coin design provision,
Senator Alan Cranston of California,
that the coin provision would result
in the bill’s being killed that Cran-
ston stopped his intense lobbying
efforts in the House on behalf of the
coin redesign.

With so many Americans in need
of quality, affordable housing, it is
frightening that this much-needed
housing bill was almost sabotaged
because of the intractablity of Senator
Cranston regarding the needless rede-
signing of coins.

What we read determines our fate:
National identity is based on the classics of our culture

 

MY VIEW
By James Atlas

 

In the spring of 1987, Professor
Allan Bloom, a member of the Com-
mittee on Social Thought at the Uni-

_ versity of Chicago and the author of

a well-regarded translation of Rous-
seau’s Emile, among other scholarly
works, published a book about higher
education in America. Issued in a
first printing of five thousand by
Simon & Schuster, The Closing of
the American Mind sold over a mil-
lion copies. Its author, to his utter
amazement, found himself an
American celebrity, interviewed by
Oprah Winfrey, profiled in Time, his
photograph on the cover of The New
York Times Magazine. For once, the
life of the mind was a public issue.

What was it about this difficult,
demanding book that made it such a
best-seller? Surely it couldn’t have
been entitled ‘‘The Nietzscheanization
of the Left or Vice Versa’’ and
‘From Socrates’ Apology to Heideg-
ger’s Rektoratsrede.’’ Bloom’s real
subject was revealed in his incendiary
subtitle: How Higher Education Has
Failed Democracy and Impoverished
America’s colleges and universities
were in trouble, Bloom declared;
students could no longer expect to
come away from their four years on
campus with even a rudimentary
grasp of their own culture and civil-
ization. ‘‘Every educational system
has a moral goal that it tries to attain
and that informs its curriculum,’’
wrote Bloom. Ours, it so happened,
was bankrupt. The permissiveness
ushered in by the 1960s had des-
troyed the old Great Books idea:

. (male) supremacy.

namely, that to be educated was to
have some acquaintance with the
classics of Western civilization.
Those classics were now ideologically
suspect; the tradition they represented
was an instrument of oppression.
Indeed, the whole idea of tradition
was elitist, a literary form of white
To study the
great works was to suffer the domin-
ation of a colonial power.

This kind of thinking had practi-
cal consequences. By the late 1980s,
the curriculum — the courses that
universities offer —- was a campus
free-for-all. ‘‘America has no-fault
automobile accidents, no-fault divor-
ces, and it is moving with the aid of
modern philosophy toward no-fault
choices,’ Bloom noted with charac-
teristic acerbity. Course requirements
were largely a thing of the past. At
a vast majority of American colleges
and universities, a student could
graduate without having taken a sin-
gle course in Western Civilization.
The idea that there existed a hierar-
chy of knowledge, a cultural tradition
made up of those works that had
survived the harsh discriminations of
the time — in Matthew Amold’s fa-
mous phrase ‘‘the best that has been
thought and said’ — was obsolete.
All over the country, colleges and
universities were busy renovating
their humanities departments, tossing
out traditional survey courses and
replacing them with new, more
‘relevant’ offerings. At Stanford,
the core list of classics was reduced
to make room for works by ‘‘women,
minorities, and persons of color.’’ At
Berkeley, freshmen and sophomores
would have to pass a one-semester
course focusing on at least three out
of five ethnic groups: Afro-Amer-
icans, Latinos, Asian-Americans,

Native Americans
Americans.

In itself, the debate over the cur-
riculum has turned out to be a good
thing. The canon, or core of great
books, is not immutable; in some
ways, the history of literature is the
history of taste. And minorities have
been slighted in the curriculum as
much as in other departments of
American life. It could be argued
that the study of one’s own literature
does promote ethnic self-pride. At
the very least, we ought to follow the
advice of Gerald Graff, a professor of
English at Northwestern and a visible
commentator on the book wars, who
urges: Teach the Debate. Examine

To be American is to
be assimilated, to
define ourselves by
what is common in
our heritage — the
shared tradition of
our language, our
literature, our ideas
about the social
covenant that
constitutes
democracy.

the processes by which books find
their way into the classroom - what
makes them representative of their
culture? How are the criteria of
literary ‘‘greatness’’ ultimately deter-
mined? ke

What has been lost in this debate
is a fundamental premise of our
culture: that to be American is to be
assimilated, to define ourselves by

and European-

 

 

what is common in our heritage —
the shared tradition of our language,
our literature, our ideas about the
social covenant that constitutes
democracy. ‘‘As our land becomes
more diverse,’’ warns Donald Kagan,
the Dean of Yale College, ‘‘the
danger of separation, segregation by
ethnic group, mutual suspicion and
hostility increases.” A core
curriculum presupposes agreement: if
not about what the Great Books are, '
at the very least that there are Great ,
Books. The university today is like
the nature-theater of Oklahoma in
Franz Kafka’s novel America, where
‘everyone is welcome, everyone can
be an artist.’ To distinguish among
cultures is to be guilty of ‘‘cultural
relativism’’ — to establish hierarchies
of value. And that’s anti-American.

But is it? The books we read
and teach reflect the way this country
defines itself as a collective enter-
prise. To read English and American
literature, the classics of our Western
culture, is to discover the sources of
a national identity. And that identity
makes itself felt in a global way:
our foreign policy is an expression of
our self-image. ‘‘Just as in politics
the responsibility for the fate of free-
dom in the world has developed upon
our universities, and the two are
related as they have never been
before,’’ writes Bloom on the last
page of his humanities. What we
read, he’s saying — if we read — will
determine America’s fate. That's
why college catalogues should be
required reading for anyone concerned
about America’s future. They say a
lot about us. In the end, we are
what we read,

‘Wilder, Terry change positions

- Officials now say they support coeducation for VMI

 

» By Jason Kelley

Senior Copy Editor

 

Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder
broke his silence last week and spoke
out in favor of the federal govern-
ment’s suit to force Virginia Military
Institute to admit women, and Attor-
ney General Mary Sue Terry an-
nounced Tuesday that she will ask to

» be excused as defense attorney in the

case.
Wilder, in what many believe to

» be a move motivated by aspirations

to national office, said he favors
admitting women to the school and
would not hesitate to sign such legis-

, lation if passed by the General

Assembly.

“I believe that no person should
be denied admittance to a school
supported by state funds solely be-
cause of his or her race or gender,”’

; Wilder said in Richmond last Tues-

)

day. :

Terry said she can no longer
defend VMI because her strategy was
shot down by Wilder’s announcement.

“T will work in concert with the
governor,’ she said. ‘‘It is my job to
help the governor achieve his aims.’’

Until last week, Wilder had re-
mained silent on the issue since U.S.
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
sued VMI last February after the
schocl’s Board of Visitors refused to
change its male-only admissions
policy.

Wilder made his comments after
U.S. District Judge Jackson L. Kiser
ruled earlier this month in Roanoke
that Wilder would not be excused as
a codefendant in the suit against
VMI.

Officials at VMI remain optimistic
about the outcome of the case and
believe Wilder’s statement will not
affect the ruling.

“‘While we respect the Governor’s
personal view, he has said on numer-
ous occasions that it is for the Board
of Visitors of the Virginia Military
Institute to set the admissions policy
of the school,’’ said VMI Board of
Visitors President Joseph M. Spivey
il.

Former U.S. Attorney General

| Griffin Bell said he also believes,

}

«

Wilder’s statement» will: ngt harm:
yay

VMI’s case.

“It won’t hurt. Wilder is not a
judge. The last governor, Gov. (Ger-
ald) Baliles, said the same thing.”’

VMI Alumni Foundation Director
Paul Maini said most alumni do not
want the school to admit women.

“Our alumni are very concerned.
I think they’re disappointed by the
governor’s decision,’ he said. ‘‘If
there’s a universal feeling, I think
they just don’t want it to change.’’

Maini said the school fears a loss
of alumni support if it admits women.

‘There are some alumni who will
review their contributions,’’ he said.
‘‘The school they knew will change
in such a drastic way that they'll stop
their giving.’’

Maini said, though, if the courts
decide VMI must admit women, the
school will make every effort to see
that the integration is ‘‘done right’’.

“T taught at the Naval Academy
and the women there are still treated
like second-class citizens,.’’ Maini
said. ‘‘We don’t want that here.’’

He also said the press has misrep-
resented what the school is fighting
for. He said they are trying to pre-
serve their unique educational pur-
pose, not discriminate against women.

“In some ways we feel discrimi-
nated against in having someone try
to force us change our style of edu-
cation,’’ he said. ‘‘It’s not that we’re
against women. The press immediate-
ly makes it a women’s issue and it
becomes emotional.”

Past VMI Commandant William
Buchanan said, ‘‘We feel there’s still
a place in this country for single sex
education for those who choose it.’’

Maini said the area women’s
schools fear that if VMI is forced to
admit women, the state may have to
stop granting the women’s colleges
tax-exemptions and student loans
because they practice sex-discrimina-
tion in their admissions policies.

“Can you imagine Sweet Briar
having to pay property tax on it’s
physical plant or having to pay tax
on tuition?’’ he asked. ‘‘No way
could they afford it.’’

VMI admissions’ office secretary
Donna Broomall said she has re-
ceived a few calls from women re-
questing :appligations. She said the;

information to women.

‘“We just take down their name
and address for if and when we start
to admit them,’’ Broomall said.

Wilder dismissed the idea that his
move was prompted by plans to run
for national office in the future. How-
ever, political analysts believe that
Wilder spoke out against the school’s
policy because he feared he might
alienate his out-of-state supporters if
he said nothing.

Terry originally hinted that she
might ask to be excused from the
case on the same day as Wildet’s
’ statement. Terry, ‘who many believe

will run for governor in 1992, has
also been accused of changing her
stance for political reasons.

“‘T was amazed at Doug’s cyni-
cism — and Mary Sue managed to
top him before lunch,’’ said Republi-
can party official Steve Hamer.

Cadets at VMI say they’re disap-
pointed with Wilder’s stand, but that
they will remain loyal to their com-
mander-in-chief.

“We will follow his orders, but
we'd like to have him on our side,”
said Regimental Cmdr. Fredrick Leh-
man, the top-raking cadet at VMI.

“I don’t see any_ cadets rioting at

SCC rules on
Soderberg

The Student Conduct Commit-

tee on Nov. 13 held a hearing for
Peer Soderberg’s firing of a
shotgun in the early hours of
Nov. 3 in the Sigma Phi Epsilon
house during a conflict with
members of Phi Gamma Delta.

The SCC ruled that Soderberg
must do 60 hours of community
service by the end of this ac-
ademic year and write a letter of
apology for the incident to The
Ring-tum Phi. Soderberg will
also be on probation for as long
as he attends W&L.

‘‘T think due to the extenuat-
ing circumstances ... which were
being assaulted in my own house
and having little other recourse to
fall back on ... it [the SCC penal-
ty] was fair,’’ Soderberg said.

The SCC will deliberate
further on the events of that
evening, including the conflict
between Soderberg and Kirk
Sohonage, a member of Fiji, on
Sunday and Monday. Both
Soderberg and Sohonage will be
defendants.

On January 15, Soderberg will
go on trial for the felony of
malicious discharge of a firearm.

NEWS BRIEFS

Bidlack plans
trip to USSR

Dr. Richard Bidlack of the Histo-
ry department is planning to take
twenty W&L students to the
Soviet Union for supervised study
during spring term.

The program consists of a
week of intensive on-campus
study at W&L followed by four
weeks of travel in the Soviet
Union. Students will then return
to W&L for the final week of
spring term and have the entire
summer to write their research
paper. Students will choose a
changing aspect of Soviet society
to study and research.

The complete travel itinerary
is not yet determined but Bidlack
plans to visit Moscow, Leningrad,
the Baltic region and the Cauca-
sus Mountains. In each city,
students will visit historic sights
and museums, attend evening

cultural performances and interact _

with Soviet students their own
age.

Bidlack led a similar tour of
the U.S.S.R. in 1989.
He is excited because the trip is

offered at a time when the Soviet
Union is changing more dramati-
cally than any other period in its
history. The tour will enter two
regions — the Baltic and Caucasus
areas — with strong separatist
movements.

The .course is limited to
twenty students. The cost of the
program will likely range between
$3,000 and $3,500. Any students
interested should call Dr. Bidlack
at 463-8912 or stop by his office
in Newcomb 36-B. The deadline
for applications is mid January.

Freshmen help
local families

The children of six Rock-

bridge County area families will
have a special Christmas this year
thanks to Washington and Lee’s
freshman, class.

The freshmen, dorm counsel-
ors and the Rockbridge Area
Department of Social Services
have started the Holiday Adopt-
a-Family Project. Freshman will
donate both practical gifts and
toys to fourteen needy children of

A

six families.

“The freshman are probably
going to contribute money and go
to Wall-Mart and other places to
buy food and clothes," Dorm
Counselor Brooke Jarabek said.

The freshman class has been
divided into six sections by dorm.
Each of the four floors of Gra-
ham-Lees will adopt a family.
Gilliam dormitory and Baker and
Davis dorms will sponsor the two
other families.

A dorm counselor and one
freshman from each hall in the
section will collect money and
gifts, buy any necessary items and
wrap the presents. All gifts must
be wrapped by Friday, Dec. 7.

Jarabek emphasized that most
of the gifts will be practical. The
children will receive some toys,
but the freshman will buy mainly
canned goods, diapers, clothes and
blankets.

Lisa Coffey of the Rockbridge
Area Department .of Social
Services helped the dorm counsel-
ors and freshman pick families
that really needed help.

‘‘She made sure she got very
needy families, families that this
(project) would make or break
their Christmas,”’ Jarabek said.

Service to be
held in Chapel

Washington and Lee’s annual
Christmas Candlelight service will
be held at 7:30 p.m. Thursday,
Dec. 6, in Lee Chapel. The public
is invited to attend.

The traditional service of
lessons and carols is an ancient
form of service that tells the story
of sacred history from the Cre-
ation of Man to the INcarnation.

Participants in the service will
be Washington and Lee students
and faculty. Music will be per-
formed by members of the Uni-
versity Chorus, directed by Gor-
don P. Spice. Timothy Gaylard
will be the organist.

The service is sponsored by
the University Federation, a non-
denominational organization of
religious and community volunteer
service at Washington and Lee.
Collections from the offering at
the candlelight service will be
devoted to the support of the
annual Winter Children’s Clothing
Fund, a project for needy children
in the Rockbridge County area.

Rush, which begins January 11,
will mark the third year for sororities

Formal Rush for Delta Gamma,
W&L’s fourth sorority, joining Kappa
Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma
and Chi Omega.

An information session for rushees
will be held January 10.

Although Winter Rush is intended
primarily to recruit freshmen, As-
sociate Dean of Students for Greek
Affairs Leroy ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins
estimated that 20 upperclassmen fe-
males have signed up to go through
Rush.

visits in Jan.

Charlie Plumb, former naval
flight officer and POW in Viet-
nam, will give a speech titled
“Overcoming Adversity’’ in Lee
Chapel on Wednesday, Jan. 8, at
8 p.m. The speech is sponsored
by Contact, a program sponsored
and financed by students which
brings noted speakers to campus.
The speech is free and open to
the public.

Plumb received his commis-
sion from the United States Naval
Academy in 1964 where he grad-
uated with a B.S. degree. He
went to flight training in Florida,
Mississippi, Texas, and eventually

women.

Atkins said that more women will
participate in Rush than last year, and
if numbers continue to rise, the Pan-
hellenic Council may consider allow-
ing another sorority to colonize at
W&L in the next few years.

“If there is parity in the size of
the existing chapters and the percent-
age of women who join is higher,
then bringing in a fourth chapter will
not have accomplished anything in
terms of lowering the over-all size of
the chapters,’’ Atkins said. ‘‘All it
will have done is stabilize the num-
bers at a higher figure than what to San Diego where he was

Infinite: Nature as God’s Body in
the Art and Age of Caspar David
Friedrich’’ on Friday, Nov. 30, at

.

Two years ago, the Washington
and Lee basketball team went through
home schedule with an un-

blemished 14-0 mark.

This season, the Generals have
: struggled to an 0-3 mark at home
‘ early, but oddly enough, the most
‘ recent home loss left as pleasant a
‘ taste as a loss can in the mouth of
‘ head coach Verne Canfield.

‘We couldn’t have asked for

its

 

anything else against a good team,”’
he said. ‘‘We had a shot to win at
the end. You can’t ask for much
more than that.’’

The ‘oss came to arch-rival
Hampden-Sydney in the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference opener for
both schools, and for the Generals,
the 68-67 loss was as heartbreaking
as a loss can be.

W&L rallied from 66-58 down in
the final 2:17 to tie the game at 66
with 1:07 left on a long three point
goal from senior Pat Gallavan.

The Generals sandwiched senior

in thriller to H-SC, 68-67

Ed Hart's steal and spectacular dunk
between three point goals from senior
Jim Casey and Gallavan.

After a time-out, H-SC’s Bat
Barber was fouled as he drove to the
basket with 41 seconds left and con-
verted both shots to give the Tigers
a 68-66 lead.

W&L had a shot to tie when, on
an inbound piay with 19 seconds left,
Casey found Hart for a lay-up. Orson
Williams prevented Hart from making
the shot but fouled him in the pro-
cess. Hart hit the first but missed the
second free throw, and W&L fouled
Russell Turner on the rebound with
17 seconds left.

Turner badly missed the front end
of the one-and-one, and Gallavan
controlled the rebound for the Gener-
als. The ball went to senior Chris
Jacobs, but his foul line jumper
wouldn’t fall. W&L was given new
life when the rebound was thrown out
of bounds by a H-SC player with
four seconds left.

After a time-out, the Generals had

j a chance to win, but Gallavan’s 18

foot jumper rimmed out, and the
Tigers escaped from Lexington with
a 68-67 win.

“We had our chances,’’ said
senior co-captain Mike Holton. ‘‘We
followed our game plan for the most
part and had just a few breakdowns
at either end. We had no doubt that
we could win the game at the end,
but the shots just didn’t fall.’’

Jacobs led the way with 20
points, while Hart chipped in with 17
points, seven rebounds and five
steals.

“Ed played a beautiful game at
both ends of the floor,’’ said Can-
field. ‘‘Chris regained his scoring
touch. [Junior] Courtney Penn bor-
dered on playing a dominant role
inside defensively.”’

W&L had won two games in a
row after dropping both games in the
W&L Tip-Off Tournament by three
points. Hart led the Generals in the
tourney with 34 points and 19 re-
bounds.

The Generals got a career high 33
points from Hart in an 84-71 win at
Marymount. Holton chipped in 16
points and seven assists while Jacobs
had 11 rebounds. W&L held Mary-
mount to just 34 percent shooting for
the game and forced 25 turnovers.

Tournament with a sprained ankle. He
chipped in seven points and nine

“The first two games left me
puzzled,’’ said Canfield. ‘‘I saw
some of the things we were doing
last year, and that bothered me. We
were hurrying, and we are not effec-
tive when we hurry.

“‘We played well on the road in
both games. We played well in the
setting I though we could succeed in.
We controlled the tempo and played

_W&L swimmers

 

From W&L Sports Information

They say it’s much harder staying
at the top than it is getting there. Ask
the Oakland A’s. They know. Ask
Donald Trump. He knows. Ask
Washington and Lee swimming coach
Page Remillard. He really knows, and
he’s finding out about it right now.

Remillard begins his 12th season
at the helm of the W&L aquatics
program this year, and he’s faced
with the challenge of trying to stay
on top.

The Generals’ men’s teams have
had seven consecutive winning sea-
sons and six Top 20 national finishes
in the last decade. The women’s
teams have won three straight Old
Dominion Athletic Conference cham-
pionships and have sent three swim-
mers to the NCAA Championships in
the last two years.

Now comes the hard part. Main-
taining that level of success. Remil-
lard has some proven talent on his
roster, but he knows that talent will
be tested severely as the competition
gets tougher. On the women’s side,
the Generals receive no favors as
defending champs.

‘The conference is catching up
and they’re doing it rapidly,’’ Remil-
lard says. ‘‘This will be a more dif-
ficult year to win the conference than
it has since we began competing for
the ODAC title. In fact, it might even
be an upset if we do win it all.”’

Although the men will not be
defending a conference title, they do
have their past success to uphold.
W&L’s eight wins last year were the
most since 1987, and W&L’s All-
America production of four last year
was consistent with previous year’s
numbers. Maintaining that sort of
performance will be no easy chore.

In winning their third ODAC title
in as many as years (the first time
that had been in league history), the
women’s team placed eight swimmers
on the all-conference team. Six of
those swimmers are back, and all of
them have designs on repeating that
sort of performance — and maybe
even going beyond.

Leading the way is 1990 All-
American Claire Dudley, who returns
for her sophomore year after estab-
lishing four new school records last
year, including the 100 and 200

set for success

 

 

Senior Sharon Coleman in action last year
straight ODAC title and a trip to Atlanta an

breaststroke and the 200 and 400
individual medley.

Dudley’s classmate Stephanie
Sauers had nearly as good a year as
Dudley and just fell short of Dudley
in the race for ODAC Swimmer of
the Year. Sauers set new marks in
the 50 and 100 freestyle.

To go with those youngsters,
Remillard has a solid corps of vet-
eran standouts led by 1989 All-Amer-
ican Sharon Coleman. Coleman barely
missed the national cut times last
year, but she, like many of her team-
mates, has her sights on greater
things this winter.

Seniors Carol Dannelly and Kris-
ten Wagner give the Generals some
proven talent in the distance freestyle
events, while Keiko Harada, another
senior, will continue to be the Gen-
erals’ all-purpose swimmer, shoring
up the lineup wherever it needs to be.

Remillard also could get some big
things from junior Jodi Herring,
who showed her strength in both the

distance and sprint freestyle events.

 

 

 

 

‘We have a lot of women plann-
ing to go to Atlanta in March (for
the national championships),’’ Remil-
lard says. ‘‘That should help us con-
tinue to contend for the ODAC title,
too. I think our freshmen will be
strong, too. They’ll fill any gaps we
might have.”’

Remillard concedes there will be
plenty of gaps to be filled on the
men’s side, but he’s taking a positive
approach to the 1990-91 campaign.

He’s got All-American Chip Nord-
hoff back for another run at nationals.
Nordhoff, a junior, was the pleasant
surprise of last year, finishing out the
regular season with a strong perfor-
mance at the Atlantic States cham-
pionships and then placing in the top
15 at nationals in both the 200 back-
stroke and the 200 freestyle.

Jim Dunlevy, winner of the team’s
most improved swimmer award as a
sophomore and the team’s spirit
award as a junior, also returns for a
final chance to make all of his hard
work pay off.

. Coleman will look to help the Generals to their fourth
d the NCAA Championships. File photo.

Junior Doug Brown, owner of
W&L’s fastest times in all the dis-
tance freestyle events also should
have a chance at some impressi-”
individual honors.

“I think we've got some people
who are real threats to get to the
finals at nationals,’ the W&L coach
says. ‘‘The team’s success is always
important to us, but we may be in a
situation this year where individual
achievements overshadow the success
of the team.”’

So, there will be success in 1990-
91 for Washington and Lee swim-
ming. Be sure of that. And really
that’s not much of a change from
where the program usually is. The
Generals should have enough fire-
power to keep them around the top,
which we all know jis a tough thing
to do when you're expected to do it.

The women open their season
Saturday with a meet at Sweet Briar.

with 519 assists in 1990, giving
her 1,400 for her career. She was
also W&L’s first ever first-team
All-Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference selection. Jay is a Busi-
ness Administration major with a
3.717 GPA.

Irons finished 1990 second in
the ODAC in receptions and was
a first-team All-ODAC pick for the
second straight season. Irons set
school records for receptions (75)
and receiving yards (1,010) in a
season in 1989. Irons is an English
major with a 3.246 GPA.

Both Jay and Irons will be
placed on the national ballot for
the college division Academic All-
America team, which includes
NCAA Division II and III schools
and NAIA schools.

W&L, which finished 15th last
year, will be one of 20 teams
competing. The Generals’ best
finish was 10th in 1988.

‘We're looking forward to
getting into our first competition
after the Thanksgiving break,”’ said
head coach Gary Franke. ‘‘It’s a
very good Division III test. We'll
find out how we compare to some
of the best Division III programs
around.”’

Monday December 8, Southern Comfort will
record their repertoire in Lee Chapel.

“We are very excited to put this recording
together,’ said Southern Comfort Student
Leader Rob Aliff. ‘‘This is the second year this
group has been together since no one grad-
uated last year. We think this is the year to do
something like this.’’

The members of this year’s Southern Com-
fort have never recorded an album before, said
Aliff. The last recording Southern Comfort did
was in the early 1980s entitled Southern Com-
fort on the Rocks.

‘‘We are concentrating a lot more on the
music this year. The actual members are
arranging the music,’’ said Aliff. ‘‘We have a
lot of a cappella pieces because we feel we
have the voices to do so,”’

The concert will also include new songs
along with pieces from the past brought back
into their repertoire. Half the songs are a
cappella pieces, a few are accompanied with
guitar and the rest are accompanied with piano,
Aliff said.

Some songs arranged this year are Is She
Really Going Out With Him? arranged by
Southern Comfort member Bryant Spann, the

Mama mia! Manicotti on

for the holidays

Eagles’ Seven Bridges Road arranged by
sophomore Julie Edgar, and Southern Comfort
pianist J.R. Smith has arranged Helplessly
Hoping by Crosby, Stills and Nash for the
guitar.

“We are also going to sing a couple
Christmas songs to get everyone in the mood
for the Holidays,”’ said Aliff.

Next semester’s tour schedule is not final-
ized, however, Southem Comfort will be
preforming at the Greenbriar resort over Winter
Break. Recently the group sang in Philadelphia
for a fund raiser benefitting Chestnut Hill Col-
lege. Southern Comfort tours frequently at the
area women’s colleges. Last February, Southern
Comfort and JubiLee, the Women’s a cappella
group, toured seven cities in ten days.

“On our tour with JubiLee last February,
we sang for different alumnae chapters,’’ said
Aliff. ‘‘We have already sung for a lot of
alumnae events this year.”’

The members of Southern Comfort are very
diverse. They come from all over the country,
and represent different fraternity groups on
campus as well. Out of the 13 members, seven
fraternities and independents are represented.

“Souther Comfort is a special group
because of its diversity of members,’’ said
Aliff. ‘‘The members of Southern Comfort like
to sing, to have a good time, and they like to
travel.’’

Canoli and scungilli lovers,
rejoice! Lexington has a new Italian
restaurant that replaces the need to
drive to Staunton or Roanoke for
authentic pasta dishes: Il Palazzo.

I Palazzo opened over Thanksgiv-
ing break and has enjoyed a steady
stream of local residents and W&L
customers. Marble booths, murals,

and lighting create an elegant but

of a newly-opened restaurant as
everyone begins to figure out where
everything is for the first time. Seat-
ing was a little disorganized as well;
again, that’s because the restaurant is
brand new. In a month Il Palazzo
will be running smoothly, hopefully
drawing a large clientele.

Il Palazzo offers a variety of
authentic Italian food including:

esubmarine sandwiches, hot or

ecalzones (sort of a pizza folded

in half, like a pita pouch)

pasta dishes

*soups and salads.

After 4 PM, customers can eat a
good selection of meat and pasta
dishes or seafood entrees, including
spaghetti with veal cutlet parmesan
and a fisherman’s platter with clams,
muscles, shrimp, scallops, and
calamari cooked with marinara sauce.

cheese and chocolate chips filling,
and the whole thing is covered in
powdered sugar. Italian cheesecake,
amaretto cheesecake, and French silk
pie round out the dessert menu.

Il Palazzo is located on 24 North
