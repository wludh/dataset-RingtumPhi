By the time the expected 2500

Welcome all to
Arthur’s Camelot

splendor and fabled aura of King
Arthur’s Camelot.

At the Ball you may wander
into an Enchanted Forest, encoun-
ter a fiery dragon, or catch a
glimpse of Merlin the sorcerer in
his magic room and maybe even
see Arthur himself at his castle.

Following in the footsteps of
last year’s theme, ‘‘Gatsby’s
Great Gala,’’ this year’s theme
combines Washington and Lee’s
largest gala event of the year with
those of another time period. As
well, the Ball could exemplify a
joining of the noble ideals shared
by W&L, as examplified in our
Honor Code, and the gallant
attitude and chivalric code ob-

served by the inhabitants of Cam-
elot and the members of The
Round Table.

Included in this supplement
are explanations of various as-
pects of the Arthurian legend and
medieval life. Take some time in
reading its contents. Perhaps you
will glean from these articles a
greater appreciation for our hon-
ored event, which has been called
“the South’s outstanding colle-
giate social event,’ and the spirit
in which it is being celebrated,
and perhaps you may gain an
understanding of a culture so far
away, yet so similar in principles.

 

 

The Legend of King Arthur

 

By Jennifer Zambone
Staff Reporter

 

nce upon a time, on
the Island of the
} Might which we
1 know as Britain, the

E High King Uther
Pendragon fell in love with the
beautiful Igraine, wife of Gorlois,
duke of Cornwall, and mother of
three daughters: Morguase, Elaine
and Morgan (At this time, the
daughters are but children, but
later they are pivotal so please try
to remember their names).

Uther told Igraine of his love,
and she, having the proper in-
stincts of a woman of the time,
promptly told her husband of
Uther’s desires. Her husband,
acting as most husbands would if
their wives were tractable enough,
promptly packed Igraine off to
Tintagel, a castle noted for its
fortifications, while he went to
the Castle of Terrabil to prepare
for the inevitable confrontation.

One does not become High
King through passive behavior.
Uther wanted Igraine even more
now that she was forbidden fruit.
Therefore, he laid siege to Ter-
rabil; but this was not enough.
Uther, desparate to fulfill his
physical desires, enlisted the aid
of Merlin, a man of much wis-
dom. Merlin advised the King
who then acted upon his advice.

Disguised as Gorlois, Uther
safely entered Tintagel and had
his pleasure with Igraine. Some
say that Igraine was not deceived
by appearances, and yet because
of this the lady was eager. So the
two sported, while Gorlois having
been killed an hour prior to the
liaison lay in a field outside of
Terrabil.

 

When the period of mourning
was over, Uther made Igraine his
queen. Two of Igraine’s daugh-
ters, were married off and the
remaining one, Morgan, was put
into a convent. The queen, how-
ever, had other concerns than her
maturing children, for she was
with child, a child conceived
during the night at Tintagel.

On a stormy night in Decem-
ber, Igraine gave birth to a son
who was promptly removed from
the castle and given to a poor
man who stood outside the gates
in accordance with the instructions
of the King. The poor man was
Merlin. He took the child, who
was to be christened Arthur, to a
knight called Ector. Thus, it was
that Arthur matured in Sir Ector’s
household along with Sir Ector’s
real son and Arthur’s foster broth-
er Kay (Some of you may be
wondering about this strange
arrangement.

 

Mines hdensclf ?

unaware of his
true identity,
proved his right
to rule when he
pulled the
sword from the
stone.

 

“(Malory tells us that it comes
about through a deal made be-
tween Uther and Merlin which
basically said that if Merlin could
get Uther into Tintagel, Uther

would give Merlin the offspring
of that night of pleasure. The
truth of the matter is probably the
fact that Arthur is technically a
bastard, and bastardy, while com-
mon, was still not a pleasant state
of existence. A bastard had no
rights to his father’s wealth or
property.

(Furthermore, the fact that
‘Igraine and Uther had been fool-
ing around the time of Gorlois’
death would be something that
Uther, for one, would have liked
to keep under wraps. No matter
how strong one is there is always
the possibility that someone else
is stronger and the first rule is to
never let this person find the
chink in one’s armor.)

Uther, however, could not last
forever, and when he died, he
named his only son, Arthur, as
his heir to the throne. This was
not a popular decision even when
Arthur, himself unaware of his
true identity, proved it and his
right to rule when he pulled the
sword from the stone. (Please
note this sword is not Excalibur,
I repeat, not Excalibur. Excalibur
comes later.)

Many of the kings, resentful
of Arthur’s claim, demonstrated
that they had a problem with
Arthur’s succession by waging
war against Arthur. (War, as you
can probably tell by now was
waged at the drop of a hat for
any ‘‘valid reason.’’) Arthur,
counseled by Merlin, enlisted the
help of two brothers who had the
reputation of remarkable prowess
on the battlefield, King Ban of
Benwick and King Bors of Gaul.

With the help of these two
men, Arthur was able to defeat
his enemies and to establish his

ho was King Arthur
really? No one
knows for certain if
King Arthur actual-
ly existed. Some
say Arthur is mere-
ly a fictional character, while
others claim Arthur is the human
embodiment of a Celtic god.
Most, however, believe that some-
where in the mists of time there
was a figure which gave rise to
the origin of the man we refer to
as King Arthur. This belief is
based, not on solid unshakable
fact, but on _ circumstantial
evidence and the conviction that
a man who possesses such a
detailed history and a world-wide
reputation must have some factual
origins.

One of the earliest allusions to
the figure of Arthur is found in a
series of poems wherein Arthur is
mentioned as a man of great
prowess. Later poems refer to
Arthur as a great warrior and
mention that he was accompanied
by a band of warriors.

By the time the oral traditions of

bardic lore such as the Welsh
Triads and the Mabinogion were
recorded, Arthur had become
firmly established in British lore
as a powerful warrior-prince with
a mighty group of followers.

Although such documentation
of Arthur’s existence could be

‘The Ring-tum Phi Fancy Dress Supplement, February 28, 1991

The search for the real Arthur

dismissed as legend, it is harder
to dismiss the two Welsh his-
torians who mention Arthur in
their separate accounts.In the His-
toria Brittonum, written by Nen-
nius, Arthur is called ‘‘Dux Bel-
lorum,’’the leader of wars, and he
is also listed as the victor in 12
major battles, including the battle
of Mount Badon a struggle which
provides a crucial link between
recorded history and legend. For
in Arthurian lore, Arthur decisive-
ly prevented further Saxon
intrusion into Western Britain by
crushing the Saxon armies at the
battle of Mount Badon. The An-
nales Cambriea also refer to
Badon and, as an added bonus
mention Camlann, Arthur’s last
battle.

Spurred on by such referen-
ces, several researchers have
attempted to further corroborate
them with physical evidence.
Noted Arthurian scholar Leslie
Alcock conducted an archaeologi-
cal dig during the 1960s at Cad-
bury Hill, the legendary sight of
Camelot. On the hill, Alcock
found a fort which had been

King Arthur standing upon

nations he is supposed to

 

heavily refortified in the fifth
century. This observation led Al-
cock and his colleague Geoffrey
Ashe to believe the fort must
have been a camp for a major
British military figure, for it was
situated too far from the part of
Britain occupied by Saxons at that
time to be considered a place of
refuge for oppressed Celts.

In the early 1970s, the use of
Welsh literature as a basis for
proving Arthur’s existence was
scathingly denounced by some
theorists, and scholars were forced
to find other sources to support
their theories, and in the 1980s
authors such as Nikolai Tolstoy in
his book The Quest for Merlin
and Geoffrey Ashe in his work
The Discovery of King Arthur,
utilized a ‘‘new’’ source upon
which to base their explanations,
Geoffrey of Monmouth’s The
History of the Kings of Britain.

Apparently Geoffrey was more
accurate with his facts than for
which he was originally given
credit. By studying Geoffrey’s
work, Ashe has determined that
the Arthur Geoffrey described was
an actual figure known as
Riothamus. Ashe claims
Riothamus was really a_ title
meaning ‘‘most kingly,’’ and thus
this man must have had another
name besides his title. Why not
Arthur?

Lending further support to this
theory are Welsh family
genealogies which indicate a
sudden surge in the popularity of
this name at the end of the sixth
century. Such favor would suggest
the name was held in_ great
regard, perhaps because it was the
name of a national hero. As
well, the incidence recorded in
which the historical figure of
Riothamus is featured correspond
with events given by Geoffrey
that occur in the life of Arthur.

Riothamus is the only British
king ever mentioned who led a
group of British warriors into
Gaul, as Arthur did. Riothamus
was reportedly betrayed by a
deputy ruler who entered into a
pact with the barbarians. Arthur
was betrayed by his son Mordred
in a similar manner. Ashe asserts
that the time frames in which
Arthur and Riothamus existed
coincide, but this idea may have
been disregarded because of a 28-
year time-error margin created by
varying beliefs concerning the
beginning of the anno Domini
period.

Thus the true existence of
King Arthur may or may not have
historical backing. No one as yet
has satisfactorily answered that
question. Some theorists have
even questioned if the physical
reality of a King Arthur figure is
necessary to the potency of the
Arthurian legends.

Arthurian novelist T.H. White

said searching for the historical

beauty found in the legends. Yet
the more acquainted one becomes
with Arthurian legend, the more
one believes in Arthur as a realis-
tic figure, not because the legends

are as tangible.proof of his exis-
tence, but because, like Arthur
and Riothamus, there is no reason
why truth and legend should not
be one in the same.

ccording to Malory,
the Table Round was
j given to King
J Leodegrance’ of
Camelerd by Uther
Pendragon. Thus, one imagines
that King Leodgrance found it
particularly fitting to give the
Round Table, as it is more com-
monly called, to Uther’s son, the
newly crowned King Arthur, as
his daughter Guenevere’s dowry.
Even though Uther may have
started the Round Table, it was
Arthur who made the Round
Table as we conceive it to be.
Arthur’s formula for the Round
Table was simple: take the best
one hundred and fifty knights in
the kingdom and have them
swear allegiance to one, a pro-
cess which theoretically gives
one total control over their ac-
tions. Next, instill in them ideas
of moral rectitude, then tum
them loose.

In theory, these knights sho-
uld ride about the countryside
practicing what they have learned
conceming what is meet and
proper 1o do. Thus one has, in
one fell swoop, both established
a sort of police force to preserve
order in the kingdom and man-
aged to prevent the 150 best
fighters in the kingdom from
running amuck in peacetime.

Suprisingly, Arthur’s concept
of the Table Round was a stun-
ning success, if only for a while.
It became known far and wide as
the most noble, honorable and
best fighting force around. It

All the king’s men...

was quite simply the organization
to join and knights came from
far and wide to do precisely that.

The institution of the Round
Table brought these men togeth-
er. The knights, however, did
not become mere carbon copies
of each other, but rather main-
tained their own distinct person-
alties which in of themselves
helped to increase the illustrious
reputation of the Table Round
even more.

Three knights who through
individual prowess and a joint
effort greatly contributed to the
formidible reputation of the
Round Table in a spiritual rather
than a secular manner were cal-
led the Grail knights.

One of the Grail knights
was Launcelot’s first cousin,
King Bors of Gaul’s son, Sir
Bors de Ganis. Sir Bors is an

interesting character. His only
sinful transgression was to have

sex once with the daughter of
King Brandegoris. He is also a
plain spoken man and is the only
knight in the entire Le Morte
d’ Arthur who tells off Guenevere.
In fact, he does it more than
once.

It would appear that these
virtues, as well as his astounding
humility, allow him to be one of
the three knights who achieve the
Holy Grail. For Bors, it is not
an easy task. Constantly facing
variously disguised trials, Bors
manages to get though each one

either by obstinate perseverance of

will or thought or by dumb luck.

Out of the three Grail knig-
hts, Sir Bors is the easiest with
whom one can identify. He is
the flawed Grail knight who pos-

sesses a faith based in thought.

If Sir Bors has a thought
based faith, Sir Percival de Gales
is a man who holds a simple,
innocent, child-like faith, and it is
through this type of faith that he
achieves the Grail.

The son of King Pellinor
and the brother of Sir Lamorak,
Percival never doubts that things
will turn out for the best. He
does not know that everything
will be hunky dory. He just be-
lieves that that is the way things
will be and when the going gets
rough all one has to his pray and
the world will be put aright. He
is the most endearing of the Grail
knights.

The least endearing and the
one with whom one tends to
identify the least is the pure knig-
ht, Sir Galahad. It is his very
purity which alienates him from
the mainstream of humanity. Sir
Galahad possess an unshakable,
spiritual faith, While Percival
only believes that things will tum
out for the best, Galahad knows
that they will.

The bastard son of the great
du Lac, he rides serenely confi-
dent through life untouched by
doubt, fear or ignorance and
therefore untouched by the hu-
man state of being. He lacks
compassion for his fellow hu-
mans because he can not under-
stand their foibles. The sole
reason for his existence is the
achievement of the Grail, and
when he achieves it, he dies.
There is nothing else to hold him
on earth.

While the Grail knights con-
tributed to the reputation of the
Round Table by stressing a spiri-

  
   
 

tual theme, other knights were
bolstering the secular prestige of
Camelot.

The best known of these fig-
ures is undoubtedly Sir Launcelot
du Lac. The son of King Ban of
Benwick, King Arthur’s ally at
the Battle of Bedegraine,
Launcelot leaves home at a ten-
der age to fulfill the prophecy
made by Merlin that he will be
"the man of most worship of the
age."

For Launcelot, Camelot is
just the place to achicve this
status and achieve it he does. In
time, because of his extraordinary
prowess, his unfailing . chivalry,
and the respect allotted to him by
his peers, Launcelot does indeed
become the most valiant knight,
and King Arthur’s best friend as

well.

Launcelot, however, is not
without flaws. In the process of
achieving his status, he falls in
love with Queen Guenevere and
she with him. This illicit love js
the major contributing factor to
the downfall of the Round Table
as well as the reason why
Launcelot can not achieve the one
quest he truly wants, the Holy
Grail.

If Launcelot is the preux
chevalier of Camelot, the figure
that opposes him is Sir Mordred,
From the second of conception,
Mordred has strikes against him.
It is bad enough that he is a
bastard, but the bastard of an

Sa. Why do you think
Cr this year’s theme
NG
(C

 
 
 

) translates well for
Fancy Dress?

=) A: The theme of the
Arthurian Legends fits W&L’s
Fancy Dress especially well be-
cause of the formal, honorable
and majestic images that come to
mind when most students think of
King Arthur and the Knights of
the Round Table. The idea of a
‘festival’? at his court was added
because the big galas in midieval
times were called just that.
Together, the elements of both
create a perfect image of what
Fancy Dress is all about.

Q: What’s your favorite part of
this year’s ball?

A: My favorite part of this
year’s ball will be all the
‘*extras’’ we have planned, such
as the champion breed horses that
will be at the entrance (if it
doesn’t rain), poised as if their
knightly masters have gone inside
the court, and the harpist from the
Roanoke Symphony who will be
playing in the hallway entrance of
the Warner Center, there will also
be a juggler who'll be performing
in the balcony.

Q: How much money is being
Explain the budget,

A: We plan to spend about
$74,000 on this year’s ball,
however. Fancy Dress is a self-

most students realize their activity
fees don’t pay for F.D., but in-
stead FD pays for itself with
proceeds from ticket and

Q: Is there anything different or
remarkable about this year’s
Fancy Dress?

A: One of the biggest differences
in this year’s ball will be the
magnitude of the decorations. We
have put scenes in all corners of
the big gym on 2 and 3 foot
platforms, thus raising them up so
that they may be seen even when
the room is full of people.
Moreover, the decorations will be
larger than life, for example, the
castle in the gym is 17 feet tall.

date coincides with the Law
School’s Spring Break?

A: I think that it is unfortunate
that moving the ball was an un-
feasible alternative for the Student
Activities Board, but I feel that
better relations and communica-
tions were established between the
SAB and the Student’ Bar
Association as a result of the
ordeal. I am certain the mistake
will not be repeated, as we have
already planned next year’s date
in conjunction with the SBA and
the 1992 Mock Convention.

Q: Why is the theme kept
secret?

A: The theme is kept secret be-
cause it adds to the excitement
around Fancy Dress. I think if it
were released as soon as it was
decided upon, people would grow
weary of hearing about it, and the
ball would lose some of its allure.

Q: Do you think Fancy Dress
should be a costume ball?

A: I think the return to a costume
ball would be a great idea for
FD, It used to be that the stu-
dents. were measured: for their
costumes, and when they went to
pick them up, they discovered the
theme. That would be terrific, but
it is extremely difficult to find a
costume rental place to do that
now. Pushing FD as a costume
ball, though, ought to be someth-
ing considered for-the.85th ball.

F.D. Chairman John Flippen

Q: How was this year’s theme
selected?

A: The theme was selected from
a list of over 20 themes suggested
by SAB members at large. After
it was narrowed down by the
SAB (some were not really feas-
ible), the members at large and
the FD Steering Committee voted
again, yielding the top three
choices. Immediately before
Thanksgiving break, the top three
possibilities were voted on, and
King Arthur got the most votes.
The exact wording of the theme
was decided on over Christmas
when I did a lot of research into
medieval celebrations.

Q: What other themes were
considered?

A: Other themes considered in-
cluded The Circus, Mardi Gras in
Mobile, Alabama, the Pirates of
the Caribbean, Monopoly, Czarist

Russia. SAB Vice-Chairman Will
Jones’ person favorite was Elvis

at Graceland. Oddly enough, that
idea only got one vote.

Q: How are the decorations
selected and organized?

A: The decorations were chosen
after Thanksgiving when the FD
Steering Committee and its sub-
chairmen sat down and
brainstormed on what they related
to King Arthur. The creation of
the sections to be decorated in the
Warmer Center were refined with
the help of Gary Humiston, a
director of the new theatre, who
has been a consultant for this FD.
Susie Wootton and I organized

the purchase of all the supplies
for the decorations.

The tradition of courtly love

 

By Albert Zambone
Special Contributor

omantic love is an
idea, and an industry,
which is a product of
the Middle Ages. The
idea of marrying someone whom
you liked was rare in the Classi-
cal world. Marriage was primari-
ly a matter of family politics.

No one really knows for cer-
tain from whence the ideology of
love originated, though many
scholars theorize that courtly love
began in Islamic Spain.

From thence, the courtly love
tradition spread northward through
Catalonia to Provence in southern
France. There’ Provencal
troubadours, following the form of
the Islamic love song, wrote their
own songs of romance. Although
the origin of courtly love remains

 

a matter under debate, the fact is &

that courtly love really got off the
ground as an ideology in late 12th
century France, in the ‘‘courts of
love’’ of noblewomen such as
Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine;
Marie, Countess of Champagne;
Isabel, Countess of Flandes; and
Ermengarde, Viscountess of Nar-
bonne. Of these, the most influen-
tial court of love was that of
Marie of Champagne.

There are a number of sources
which give us a new view into

Marie’s court, all of which alone yy

are classic works of the Middle
Ages, and taken together are an
amazingly creative body of work.
One of the most fundamental of
these is The Art of Courtly Love
by Andreas Capellanus, literally,
Andrew the Chaplain. It is a

treatise written in scholarly Latin
with a heavy pedantic touch. If
you were to look it up on the
shelf, it would be near the
volume of laws of Phillip Augus-
tus, the great French king of the
late 12th century. In a sense, that
is highly indicative, for although
the content of the two works is
very different, the purpose is the
same.

What Andreas attempts to do
is establish all sorts of laws
regarding the art and practice of
courtly love. For example, observ-
ing that blind men cannot fall in
love since they are immune to the
physical attractions of the
opposite sex, he might formulate
maxims such as ‘‘love goes
through the eyes.’’ He also in-
cludes a number of  ‘‘case
studies,’’ imaginary situations in
which members of different social
classes conduct flirtations accord-

It doesn’t take much wit to
see that what Andreas is doing to
a large extent is parodying the
legal system of the day. Not
parodying it in the sense of
mocking it, but copying the
ponderous formalities of Norman
law (by which we are plagued
even today, another example of a
lasting ideology of the Middle
Ages) and applying them to love.
The Countess Marie and her
noble counterparts did with the
actual machinery of Medieval
French justice, translating it from
decisions on property disputes to
romantic disputes.

The process of these courts of
love is captured in another great
work which sprang from Marie’s
and other courts, the works of the
troubadours. Many of their songs
contain stories of lovers’ quarrels
which are eventually resolved
before a court of love.

All very interesting, you say,
but what has this got to do with
King Arthur’s court? Well, in a
way, everything and nothing. You
see, the historical Arthur was
probably a clean-shaven, black-
haired, hard-bitten Roman cavalry
officer and count who lived some-
time in the sixth century; nothing
really like that luxuriantly bearded
and bejeweled fellow who stares
at you from the FD posters.
However that fellow on_ the
posters is very much how the
French nobles of the 12th century
thought Arthur was like. He was
their ideal king. Remember that
Arthur lived six hundred years
before the 12th century, as remote
from them as they are from us,
give or take a hundred ycars.

So put yourself in the position
of a 12th-century adherent to the

ideal of courtly love. You look
around and see that not many
people are following the laws of
courtly love. What is needed, you
think, is a model for the courts of
the 12th century to follow, a
model from the days when

knights were brave, ladies were
beautiful, and monsters particular-
ly ugly. As it happened, there
was a mode! at hand, available in

‘The Ring-tum Phi Fancy Dress Supplement, February 28, 1991

 

The lineage of a king

 

By Jennifer Zambone
Staff Reporter

 

ne of the most dif-
ficult things in Ar-
thurian literature is
endeavoring to keep
the characters straight
and trying to determine who is
related to whom. For example, of
the approximately 150 knights of
the Round Table, many are inter-
related, and may also share the

same name. Many Arthurian
writers, recognizing that the
genealogies are  bewilderingly

complex, have decided to stick
only to the basics.

Thus, depending upon what
one reads, Mordred, for example,
was born to either one of King
Arthur’s half-sisters, Morguase or
Morgan le Fay, or a certain Anna,
who is best identified as a kinder,
gentler version of Morguase. The
only two set rules are that Arthur
is the son of Igraine and Uther,
and that Launcelot du Lac is the
offspring of King Ban of Ben-
wick. Everything else is subject to
change.

Despite the problems, one
should have at least some idea of
the genealogy involved. Thus, a
handy dandy chart and a verbal
explanation have been provided.
The chart and the explanation are
based primarily upon Malory.
The only deviations from Malory
are in the cases of Gawain,
Mordred, and Uther’s brothers,
and these deviations are based on
popular legend.

The genealogy tends to be so
complicated for two reasons. One,
many people have the same name.
Two, the amount of bed-hopping
that occurs is incredible; bastards
are extremely common and it is
hard to keep track of whom
shacked up with whom.

Uther traces his line and suc-
cession back to Magnus Maximus,
a Roman emperor who married
the heiress to Britain. Uther has
two brothers Constantine and
Aurelius Ambrosius. Constantine
pops out of the scene early when
he is murdered by a cousin,
Vortigern, in a power struggle.

Aurelius and Uther escape to
Brittany and come back later to
kill Vortigern, but that is another
story. Suffice it to say that
Aurelius Ambrosius ascends to
the throne. Eventually he dies and
Uther becomes King.

Enter Gorlois and his lovely
wife Igraine. Uther falls for her,
starts a war with her husband,
and conceives Arthur upon her.
Gorlois meanwhile has kicked the
bucket, and Uther then marries
Igraine.

The years pass, Arthur ap-

 

pears on the scene to succeed the ' turns out that Morguase is the

dying Uther. He promptly falls
for a girl named Lionars, has sex
with her, and she bears him a son
Borre, who is not given much
shift in Malory. Next, Morguase,
the stunning wife of King Lot of
Orkney, appears on the scene, her
fours sons in two, to spy on
Arthur. Arthur, finding her ravish-
ingly attractive, desires to slee»
with her. The lady is willing, and
Mordred is the product of this
union.

Mark the sequel, however; it

daughter of Igraine and Gorlois,
and thus Arthur’s half-sister,
Voila, incest! Thus, Mordred is
both nephew and son to King
Arthur as well as the half-brother
of Gawain, Gaheris, Agravaine,
and Gareth. From then on, Arthur
apparently abstains from the
physical pleasures, until he weds
Guenevere, who turns out to be
barren. No record of any offspr-
ing of Mordred’s are given in
Malory, although other sources do
say that he had two sons who
were promptly executed after his
own demise.

Gawain, on the other hand,
definitely had offspring, but men-
tioning them would be far too
confusing. After all, when one is
married three times, one is bound
to have quite a few progeny
somewhere. Gaheris and Gareth
marry sisters, Lynet and Lyonesse
respectively. Brother Agravaine
kicks in by marrying a cousin of
the sisters, Laurel.

Back to the previous genera-
tion, Morgain le Fay marries
Urines of North Wales. It is not
what one would term a_ happy
union, but it does produce a son,
Uwain, who is nephew to Arthur
and first cousin to the Orkney
clan of Gawain, Gaheris, Agra-
vaine, Gareth and Mordred. There
are the particulars of the British
Houses.

Across the channel, the brother
King Ban of Benwick and King
Bors of Gaul keep their end up as
far as populating the earth is
concerned. Ban is wed to Elaine
and the little bundles of joy
produced by this blissful union
are Launcelot du Lac and Ector

de Maris, who is not to be con-
fused with Sir Ector, King Ar-
thur’s foster father. Furthermore,
the Elaines one meets down the
road are not to be confused with
a) Launcelot’s mother (whatever
his passions, he did not have an
Oepidal complex); b) each other.

The first Elaine is the
daughter of King Pelles of the
Wastelands. She scduces Laun-
celot by pretending to be
Guenevere. He falls for it.
Galahad is born to Elaine nine
months later. The second Elaine
is the ‘“‘lily maid of Astolat.’’
Launcelot does not have sex with
her, and she dies of unrequited
love. On the other side of the
Ban-Bors duo, Bor and his lady
wife have two sons who are
mentioned, Lionel and_ Bors.
Malory mentions no sons of
Lionel. Bors, however, has an
affair with the daughtcr of the
King of Brandegoris, and they
have a son Helin le Blank.

All of this may seem very
unnecessary to modem cyes. Aficr
all, who really cares? This gencal-
ogy, however, is crucial to the
story of Arthur. One must be
aware of how strong familial ties
are. The relations of the Orkney
clan, nearly always side with the
Orkney clan even in mock battle,
the one exception being Garcth
who favors the Ban family. All
the relatives of Benwick and Gaul
fight on the side of Launcelot &
Co., and in the end, this family
loyalty will outweigh _ their
allegiance to King Arthur and that
for which he stands. The fellow-
ship is broken.

Bo Diddley

From News Releases

 

alled ‘‘The Origi-

p nator,’’ Bo Diddley is

one of the pioneers

of rock and roll. His

unique style was a major influ-

ence for many musicians and

performers throughout the late

50s, 60s, 70s, and straight through
the 80s to the 90s.

As a small boy, Elias Bates
McDaniel’s family lived in Chica-
go. While in grammar school, he
got the nickname ‘‘Bo Diddley,’’
which he began using as an ama-
teur boxer. At the age of ten, he
got a guitar as a Christmas pres-
ent and began playing it daily. He
was influenced to play guitar by
John Lee Hooker when he heard
the song ‘‘Boogie Children.’’

In 1951, Bo started playing at
the 708 Club in Chicago. In,
1955, he auditioned for Phil and
Leonard Chess of Chess Records
with a song he wrote called ‘‘Un-

 

cle John.’’ The brothers liked
what they heard so they signed
Bo to an exclusive contract and
decided to record the song. They
felt the title of the song should be
changed, so Bo named it after
himself, ‘‘Bo Diddley.’’ Bo used
maracas in the song to emphasize
the beat and sound that he was
trying to create. It took thirty-
five takes in the recording studio,
but they finally had the sound and
song they wanted. It became his

 

biggest hit in 1955, and estab-
lished his guitar sound.

The past ten years have been
Bo’s most demanding years for
performing live, television, and
radio appearances and touring.
This unique talent has been per-
forming five to seven days a
week all over the world within
the last year, showing an increase
in his popularity with young
people. Bo knows music!

Kings of Swing

  
  

 

 

Oo matter if the
crowd is young or
old, black or white,
4) zydeco music gets
7 people on their feet.

Taken from the French Creole
word ‘*haricot,’’ loosely
pronounced ‘‘air-eeco,’’ meaning
“‘snap bean,’’ the music pops:
zydeco is foot-stomping dance
music sung in English and Cre-
ole French. The traditional songs
are accompanied by accordian
and frottoir (rubboard) and grew
out of the backwaters of southern
Louisiana.

Zydeco was made popular by
the undisuputed King of Zydeco,
accordianist Clifton Chenier, who
sported a crown of jewels and
sang in French patois. His mark
in musical history has been
adopted and carried on in the
work of 42-year-old Stanley
‘*Buckwheat’’ Dural, known as
Buckwheat Zydeco.

 

Growing up on the music of
James Brown, Aretha Franklin,
and Blood Sweat and Tears, Du-
ral also heard accordian music
day in and day out; his father
was an amateur zydeco player.

Much inspired by Chenier, he
moved on to start his own Zy-
deco band. But Dural’s music
takes a slightly different tum.

“I play music for a different

 

 

 

 

 

generation, bringing together the
younger generation with the older
generation. Now you, Mom and

Dad, can go to hear Buckwheat &

Zydeco and all have fun at the
same time,’’ he exclaims.

Buckwheat Zydeco will per-
form in Doremus Gymnasium
next Friday night at the Fancy
Dress Ball.

 

From News Releases

 

he big band Kings of

ninties for almost a
decade and still hooks people of
all ages. This band’s exciting
sound is being heard on the cam-
puses of major colleges and uni-

Marsalis, C.J. Chen-

mantle of the zydeco heritage
from his father, the late and leg-
endary Clifton Chenier, and
today continues to bring zydeco
to a whole new audience.

Chenier

His father, heralded by most
as the ‘‘King Of Zydeco,’’ was
one of the pioneers of the music
in its early days, and in later
years served as its prime ambas-

young C.J. was growing up in
his father’s shadow, learning the
music from the inside out.

today, forty-

left over from
theatre production proceeds fi-
nanced the first Washington and
Lee Fancy Dress Ball, held Feb-
ruary 22, 1907, in the old gymna-
sium. An orchestra knowing all
the latest two-steps came over
from VMI to furnish the syncopa-
tion,

Annie Jo Robertson White, the
college librarian, had directed a
student play in order to raise
money for a campus organization.
Before the event White pledged
only a certain amount of money
to the organization. Yet after the
play she was faced with a dilem-
ma: they had raised forty-four
dollars above the original pledge.
Miss White decided to use the
extra money to put on a small
dance for the students involved in
the fundraiser. White sent out
invitations to the Ball with the
only stipulation that those attend-
ing had to pay approximately two
dollars for their costumes. Those
who could not afford costumes
might work for them.

In the beginning the ‘‘Hill’’
was not as tolerant of Fancy
Dress hangovers and shenanigans.
Although the first Fancy Dress
did last through the night, it was
a Thursday night, and one Ring-
tum Phi article noted that ‘‘the

1988 - Reconciliation Ball

University gave no holiday for
such useless affairs as a Fancy
Dress Ball. Students might dance
all night at the biggest ball of the
year with the understanding, how-
ever, that they return to class at 9
a.m. with lessons prepared.”’

The first Fancy Dress Ball
wasn’t as elaborate as later balls
which have featured camels, ele-
phants, train cars, and spotlights.
The forty-two dollars went for
decorations, not a terribly small
sum of money in those days, and
refreshments were provided by
Washington and Lee faculty
wives. The Ring-tum Phi also
noted the costume of choice for
the Fancy Dress Ball of 1907:

‘‘A favorite costume for that
first Fancy Dress Ball was King
Arthur’s armor — the students
coming to the dance clad in steel
mail from their helmeted head to
their steeled legs. But once was
enough. It cramped their style.”’

Although the costumes may
have cramped students’ style the
concept of a Bal Masque did not.
In years to follow the Ball gained
overwhelming approval on_ the
W&L campus and became known
for its extravagant themes and
elaborate costumes and decora-
tions.

The 1920s were considered
one of the hey-days of the' Fancy
Dress Ball, with thousands of
people in attendance. The Ball
was given national coverage,
national radio networks broad-
casted the annual Balls, and
newspapers from New York to
Texarcana reported on it. The
biggest jazz bands and orchestras
of the day played at the Ball and
hundreds of young women are
said to have traveled from cities
like Atlanta and Baltimore just to
attend. By the year 1929 Fancy
Dress had substantially grown in
size. Whereas White had deco-
rated and organized the entire
event initially, its growth led to
professional decorations, although
the format remained unchanged.

‘*Decorations changed
Doremus gymnasium into the
palace of King Shahryar, ruler of
ancient Persia. With an Oriental
theme and classic background, the
ball surpassed by far its famous
predecessors in brilliance and
novelty ’’

W&L’s Fancy Dress

Washington and Lee students
still had a penchant for assuming
the garb of historical figures.
Washington and Lee student T.G.
Gibson transformed himself into
King Shahryar, complete with a
grand throne and a fawning court.
Miss Sophia Dunlap was cast in
the role of Sultana Sheherazade
and ‘‘was brought before the ruler
on a litter borne by four Nubain
slaves.’’ Dunlap, in the guise of
Sheherazade, dazzled the King
with her famous stories of Ali
Baba and ‘The Shipwreck of
Sinbad’ while a_ group of

costumed dancers interpreted hengs

stories.

Ironically one element stays
constant down through the years:
the controversy that perpetually
swirls around those organizing
and running the ball. In the
January 17, 1936 edition of The

 

Ring-tum Phi, Glenn Shively,
president of Fancy Dress Commit-
tee, responded angrily to an earli-
er student letter which bemoaned
the rising prices of costumes.
Shively wrote that two costumers
offered to furnish Fancy Dress
costumes for the price of $2.40
per costume.

“The committee felt justified
Munchkins, wicked witches, and
kindly wizards. Fancy Dress
chairmen assumed the roles of the
Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion,
and the Tin Woodman. Revelers
walked through the farmhouse of
Dorothy, down the famous yellow
brick road, and into the
throneroom of the great and pow-
erful Oz. Les Elgart and his
orchestra provided the music for
the occasion.

Fancy Dress has always been

is rich in its history

 

ety around us. In the early years
the emphasis was placed on his-
torical characters and events. In
the 1940s and 1950s the focus
was on more ‘“‘light-hearted
themes’’ of the rich and famous.
In 1969, indicating the turbulant
events of the decade, Fancy Dress
underwent one of its most dramat-
ic changes.

The 1969 ball boasted ‘‘psy-
chedelic music and a professional
light show.’’ . Gone were the
lavish balls and exotic themes; the
Fancy Dress Committee offered
the languid theme of ‘‘An Inaugu-
ration Ball.’ © Why languid?
Well the inauguration wasn’t in
honor of a former United States
president, or a mythical Egyptian
tyrant, but rather for new Wash-
ington and Lee President Robert
Huntley.

The Saturday night concert

 

 

boasted a separate theme from the
stogy Inauguration: ‘‘Love-In
69.’’ Musical entertainment was
provided by the Kallabash Corpo-
ration and Fever Tree. The Phi
recommended that ‘‘conventional
dress’’ be abandoned and ‘‘appro-
priate dress’’ should be substi-
tuted. Apparently the student
body deemed it necessary to
forsake their tuxedos for tie-dye.

But the greatest blow came in
1971 when Fancy Dress ceased to
exist at Washington and Lee.
The chairman of the Dance Board
informed the E.C, ‘hat there
would not be a ball ‘because of
a greatly reduced budget and past
history of student disinterest.’’ A
heart-broken alumnus wrote that
“for the old grad from General
Lee’s college it is the most shat-
tering break with the past since
the Generals dropped out of big

time football.”’

The March 10, 1971 edition of
The Ring-tum Phi asked the ques-
tion ‘‘Can Fancy Dress Return?’’
The question was thankfully
‘‘yes,’’ but those canny students
heading the Dance Board saw a
new, improved Fancy Dress in the
future: a ball that forsaked the
combination of  ‘‘imagination,
innocence, and snobbishness’’ of

the past events. Was this to be a
“*kinder, gentler’’ Fancy Dress?

‘The cost is the inhibitive
thing,’’ said the Dance Board
chairman. ‘‘] don’t want to spend
more than $2,500 to $3,000 on
the thing.”’

He added that ‘‘my philosophy
is to bring it [F.D.] back, but
perhaps on a different format. I
don’t want...Glenn Miller. They
won’t attract enough people.’’
Like the Kallabash Corporation
would!

His solution: the 1972 Fancy
Dress was a 1950s revival party
with people paying $5 to hear
ShaNaNa. Miss White would
have been horrified. No black
tie? No dance band? No beauti-
ful decorations in the gym?

But Fancy Dress would rise
again. By the mid 1970s Fancy
Dress had returned to its roots as
the finest party in the South.
Fancy Dress 1976 offered the
theme ‘‘A Salute to Hollywood.”’
In perhaps a slightly mocking
tone, the Phi noted that the festi-
val was kicked off Thursday night
in the ‘‘simply yet elegantly deco-
rated Zollman’s Pavilion.’’ There
are many ways to describe
Zollman’s Pavilion, but quiet
sophistication is categorically
ruled out.

Unlike earlier years the main
dance was held in Fairfax lounge,
Evans Dining Hall, and the Cock-
pit. The entrance to Fairfax
lounge bore a ‘‘flashing Holly-
wood-type theater marquee, open
wide to admit the first lucky
couple.”’

One student hoped that ‘‘all
gentlemen attending will display
the proper attire of black tie
(tuxedo or dinner jacket, for the
hopelessly naive), if not, the burly
and altogether unpleasant doorman
may be tempted to violence.’’
Obviously some of the ‘‘Love-
In’’ mentality still lurked around
the edges of the campus.

World-renowned hypnotist

Edwin L Baron, director of the
Hypnotist Institute of Chicago,
was present to hypnotize volun-
tary subjects into ‘‘gobbling imag-
inary watermelon.’’ Finally, to
thoroughly test the mettle of
Washington and Lee students, a
grain party was sponsored by the
Freshman class during Saturday
afternoon. The party might have
given birth to the headline that
graced the 1976 Fancy Dress
edition of The Ring-tum Phi —
‘Fancy Dress Weekend arrives;
University braces for hangover.”’
One might pen a more poetic
headline, but none more realistic.

lavish decorations and beautiful
music that would have made Miss
White proud. This year will be no
different. Enjoy the 84th annual

In years past, tradition held that the young
womanwho received a bid to Fancy Dress gave
her measurements to her date so he could order
her costume. She would not be told the theme
of FD, and only when she picked up her costume
did she become aware of the theme. Nowadays
‘the theme is revealed a week ahead of time

in the annual Phi Fancy Dress Supplement.

__pancy Dress, for
Q what most people
\ remember, is not
just a night, but a
kK. series of sometimes
' painful events that
create great stories beginning with
“‘did you know that you...?’’

I’ve heard many people say
that if FD was canceled because
of the war in the Gulf, it
wouldn’t be the worst thing to
happen. There are plenty of guys
who said they could get drunk
without reaching into their wallets
to rent a tuxedo,

Fancy Dress begins to enter
the mind when you start to think
about possible dates. Of course

this doesn’t bother most people
because they have a tendency to
procrastinate. About a week
before mid-winter break, the
dating game starts. Some guys sit
in front of the Co-op and b.s
while others actually gossip on
who is available and who already
has a date.

When FD week begins on
Monday, most guys will have
their date. At this time, the guys
will get the orders from their
dates on what plans to make for
dinner and what type of tux and
cummerbund to wear. The process
of waiting with checkbook and
pen in hand in a line that is
wrapped around the university
center, The Pit and goes right out
the front door of the University
Center, for your FD parapher-
nalia is always fun.

we t was the best of
| (s) times; it was the
® worst of times...”
‘In the game of FD
there are no winners
or losers, only survivors.’’ This
advice was given to me when I
was a wide-eyed pledge back in
1988. I didn’t give it much con-
sideration back then, but after the
story I’m about to tell, you will
recognize its real worth.
Freshman year I avoided all
controversy, having learned a
valuable lesson the preceding
Homecoming. Rule #1: Guys, no
matter how much you want to go,
don’t ask someone the day before
the event especially if you’re
barely conscious at the time. If
you fail to heed this advice, the
girl who shows up might be
VERY different from the beauty
you remember(?) asking the night
before. Remember, you can al-

ways go next year and your
checkbook will be happier if you
stay home. ;

My sophomore year experience
was what all Fancy Dress
Weekends should be modeled on.
At the risk of being obscene,
everything was perfect: the date,
the drinks, the Ball. We awoke
on Sunday and it was the begin-
ning of a wonderful relationship.

However, if sophomore year
was a dream come true, junior
year was living HELL! This
brings me to Rule #2: Guys,
never ask your ex-girlfriend to
FD. Perhaps I suffered so that
others may lear from my mis-
take, at least I hope so. I'll spare
you the gory details, suffice it to
say that letting my date drink two
bottles of wine all by herself at
dinner was probably not such a
good idea. When I arrived to pick
her up for Saturday night’s band
party, I was greeted not by my
date but by a comatose Sleeping
Beauty. Abandoned and upset, I
vowed never to let this happen

The Knights

The Wednesday night before
FD is always the best party of the
year. The women from the girls
schools flock to the fraternities in
search of ‘‘the bid’’ and every
guy knows it. The next morning
most students cancel classes for
the rest of the week.

On Thursday the dates start to
come into town and the guys
without dates begin to make plans
for Georgetown. That night, you
and your date attend the big
concert. You enter the Student
Pavilion to see Murph, Baner and
the Fij security staff at the door.
The concert basically consists of
staggering around and waiting for
the featured band to play the one
hit song that you know, which
usually comes as an encore.

The Friday night ball is the
highlight of the week. This is

where the students, professors and
alumni gather in the remodeled
Warner Center. The night begins

with the attempt to make your tux
fit. It seems that the pants are
always too tight or your bow tie
is too corny. This is confirmed by
your date who tells you during
the 100 pictures her girlfriends
must take.

The dinner you planned for
yourself and your date involves
either a high class meal at an es-
tablishment such as Maple Hall
or the White Star Mill (if you
want to drive to Staunton) or a
lesson in Chinese at Hunan Gar-
den.

Following dinner, members of
fraternities gather for their tradi-
tional cocktail parties and_ hall

wx searched frantically
fs) through my drawer,
‘© throwing clothes over
my head as I pro-
gressed. I knew my
cummerbund was in there some-:
where. Jackpot! 1 grabbed the
culprit and threw it around my
waist, waved to my roommate,
and ran out the door.

I was 10 minutes late for my
first FD date and hoping that my
date would be ready.

Since arriving at W&L I had

nv

witnessed the fanfare surrounding
several events like the apartment
parties at Hollins and the races at
Foxfield to name just two. But
nothing compares to the build-up
about Fancy Dress, the biggest
social event in the South and one
of the country’s biggest parties
according to GQ. FD is also
probably the biggest night for al-
cohol sales in Virginia.

True or not, I had been told
all these things and more about
FD, and I awaited the ball with
nothing short of a religious zeal.
I believed FD would be one of
those experiences a person reme-
mbers forever, like seeing the

ARNHEIM IR

Beatles live or hearing John Ken-
nedy speak.

My date and I met our
friends, jumped in our cars and
headed to Roanoke for dinner.
(Don’t do this for FD. Don’t ever
do this.) We arrived at the res-
taurant around 6:00 p.m. It was
very classy, and the food was
excellent. Unfortunately, each
course took an hour. (I like a
nice meal as much as the next
person, but we did have a gala to
attend.) We payed our bill (Boy,
did we pay!) and rolled out of
Roanoke at 10 p.m.

We raced back to W&L in

_, hopes of at least. catching a

glimpse of the gym. As we
approached the outskirts of Lexi-
ngton, I noticed a huge spotlight
moving through the sky. This
was it! FD! My spirits soared as
I braced myself for my first Fan-
cy Dress.

We climbed the steps to the
gym quickly and entered the
world of ‘‘Gatsby’s Great Gala,”’
By that time it was 11:30, and
we didn’t have much time left
before FD would be over, but we
made the most of it.

Looking back I have nothing
but pleasant memories of Fancy
Dress, but you can bet this year |

Dress memories...

again.

So now it’s my senior year.
I’m 1-1 in the FD game and
determined to leave W&L with a
winning record. With 91 days left
until graduation by Friday, March
8, I anticipate celebrating in style.
I asked early this year, and with
a great date, I’m sure the FD
magic will return.

Some say FD is an overblown
senior prom, others can’t wait for
it to begin. As a senior, this year
will be extra special to me, and I
hope your Fancy Dress experience
is everything you want and more.
If it’s not, well at least you'll
have some good stories to tell
next year. And remember, there’s
also date-swapping...

 

 

 

By Greg Patterson

here are two things
a freshman guy has
to worry about
when he arrives at
Washington and
Lee in September:
first, getting a W&L belt to go
with his Duck Head pants and
second, getting a date for FD.

While the first problem is
easily solved by a trip to the
bookstore, the second is a little
more difficult (though some
would argue it is easily solved by
a trip to a girls’ school.)

From what I have seen, read,
and heard since I’ve been here, I
have pieced together what I think
is an accurate picture of what this
thing called Fancy Dress is really
like. With that in mind, I would
like to offer, as a service to other
confused freshman guys, a list of
answers to the most-asked ques-
tions about FD:

Q: Exactly how far out of
town am I supposed to go to
take my date to dinner? Is
Buena Vista far enough or
Should I try to get reservations
in, say, Washington?

A: Good question. A helpful
rule of thumb in this case is that
the cost of dinner for two people
should be approximately equal to
the cost of gas used in getting to
the restaurant. This method gives
you a wide range of choices. So
while you could conceivably take
your date to Taco Bell in Staun-
ton, if you are expecting to go
someplace where the waiters
won't spit on you, you will pro-
bably end up at least two states
away.

..and expectations

 

By Sharon Widmayer
Senior

 

ow that I’m a senior,

there are a lot of

things that I could

say about FD, the

most important of
which is that as of the writing of
this article, I have the perfect
dress and no date. I recently
discussed this dilemma with a
friend of mine. He said I could
go with his pet rock. That was
not the correct response. He even
suggested that I attach a string to
the rock and put it on my should-
er like an evening bag. Somehow
I think the rock would clash with
my perfect dress.

It’s not all bad. At least I
haven’t had to worry about my
date stripping down to his boxers
in the middle of Warner Center
or that he gets so drunk at dinner
that his head falls into a plate of
spaghetti. I don’t have to worry
about going to FD with someone
like Paul Lagarde. (Don’t get me
wrong; I have nothing against
Paul. It’s just that two Politics
majors with diametrically oppos-
ing views should not be allowed
in the same room for more than,
oh say, five minutes.)

Actually, I’m thinking of
going dateless. I figure I’ll make
a social statement about how one
does not need to be accompanied
by a member of the opposite sex
to have fun. And if you buy
this, I’ve got some bridges in
Brooklyn that might interest you,
too.

I must say, however, that this
is at least a new dilemma for me.
My first two FDs, I had a date,
but the dress from hell. My
mom called me up freshman year
and told me she had just bought
me two formals-- on sale-- and
wasn’t it wonderful that I
wouldn’t have to go shopping.
No. Not only did she take away
the opportunity for me to go
dress shopping, which for many
females is more fun than attend-
ing the event itself, but my
mother and I have taste in dresses
more diametrically opposed than
mine and Mr. Lagarde’s politics.

I wound up wearing this lilac
thing freshman year, and
discovered that probably the only
color I look worse in is lime
green. Not only that, but I got
my hair butchered over February
break and looked like I should be
wearing the tuxedo. But I had a
date.

Actually, I had a boyfriend, so

ith midterms and
Washington’s Break
in the past, the
thoughts of the stu-
~— dents at W&L now
turn to more pressing matters at
hand...Fancy Dress. The signs of
its eminent arrival are plenty. The
guys are grumbling about the
enormous sums of money they are
about to be shelling out, while the
female students try to look cute
and act nonchalant while they
sweat bullets waiting for a date.

All the while, girls’ school
girls pass through trying their own
luck. To some not acquainted
with Washington and Lee, it may
seem like like a lot of stress and
excitement over a mere weekend,
but any student will quickly tell
you differently. The true appeal
of Fancy Dress is its time honor-
ed tradition.

It is a weekend of revelry
which has survived the years and
the inevitable changes those years
brought with them.

I believe that the sophomore
year is the best year for Fancy

   

Dress. To the freshmen, this is

yet another new and different
experience, and the feelings of
excitement are tinged with those
of nervousness. The junior has

already traveled this path twice
before, and the glow surrounding
the event has begun to fade
slightly.

The senior has the driving
wish to commit every detail to
memory, only too aware that this
is to be the final Ball.

The sophomore, however,
stands balanced in all of these
extremes. The experience is still
new enough as to be exciting, but
having been through it, vague as
the memories may be, they know
what to expect.

Their college life stretches
before them endlessly, so there is
no urgency to ‘‘make this formal

there are still more to
come, and so enters the weekend
relaxed and .eady for fun.

The difference in how each
person perceives Fancy Dress is
minimal in the end, as everyone,
except for those with hell-dates,
ends up having a good time. And
no matter what your class,
everyone is participating in yet
another building block on which
this tradition stands.

a

     

I had a built-in, stress-free date,
or so I thought until we made the
mistake of going to Lynchburg
for dinner, and getting completely
and totally lost in some part of
Lynchburg with a bunch of dark
alleys and nothing else. Of
course, my date was the typical
male. You know-- absolutely
refused to ask directions. And of
course I was the typical hysterical
female and told him-- well actual-
ly screamed at him-- to either
stop and ask direction or he
might as well take me home.
Little did I know, we were
about three blocks from the res-
taurant at the time. I’d tell you I
had fun after that, but actually, I
don’t remember that much.
Sophomore FD was, well,
from hell. But I had a date. The
same guy from the year before,
and we had decided to go to a
restaurant where we had already
been. This year I had to wear
the other ‘‘on sale’’ dress that my
mother had bought-- a floor
length, off-the-shoulder blue and
white number that looked like the
high school prom revisited. All
my friends were wearing black
strapless sophisticated dresses, and
I was thinking of ways to torture

és) might, have this wish,
€) I wish tonight...
Betcha know what I
o wished for! Could it
have something to do with some-
thing with the two initials, F and
D? Naah...

The intense (agonizing!)
wondering over whether or not
one would get a date, and who
would it be, and WHEN WOULD
HE ASK, began months ago,
probably even before the Fancy
Dress Committee was appointed.

Undoubtedly, for some the
stress began before we freshmen
arrived at the beginning of Sep-
tember. Most of us had heard
about Fancy Dress while in the
application process, from a tour
guide or a student. Or even from
a college guide.

I was impressed just because
the guide mentioned Fancy Dress,
and I thought it must be very
important, even though it sounds
more like the name of a junior
high girls’ school dance than the
big, exciting college event it is
reputed to be.

The guide I read said some-
thing about people coming from
miles and miles around for this
huge social event, one of the
most exciting college events
around. It then said-- and I think
this is the exact wording-- ‘‘woe

Questions

from page 5

Q: There was concern that FD
would be cancelled because of
the Persian Gulf War, can you
respond?

A: I know that when the war
started, many questions were
raised about having a $74,000
party when men and women were
fighting a war. I even considered
the appropriateness of it, but I
have since been told by Faculty
and students alike that the W&L
alumni already in the Gulf would
probably feel better that the tradi-
tion continued. I have placed a
full-page ad in the FD playbill
acknowledging our troops in the
gulf, and I hope to have the
swing band dedicate a song to the
troops. Moreover, it looks like
we can celebrate a victory for our
troops now.

Q: Last year monetary
restraints were placed on FD
planning. Could you explain the
ins and outs of money and ex-
penses?

A: The budget has been the first
priority for everyone on the
Steering Committee. I really
want FD to come under budget
this year. The restraints on our
spending (such as having and
auditor to keep track of the
money, not having uncontrolled
charge *accounts, and having to
file for checks through the busi-

ness office) has made us more
conscious of how much we are
spending. Moreover, this year I
broke down the budget so that
each sub-chairman had his or her
own budgeted amount to spend or.
decorations or whatever they were
in charge of. Ultimaiely, though,
because FD is self-supportive, we
will make money only if ticket

and memorabilia sales are close to
what we projected.

Q: What’s your most difficult
duty?

A: My most difficult duty has
been getting everything in line.
That is, coordinating all the
people, places, and things so that
they all fit together and the ball
is executed as it was planned to
be. Everything you see at the
ball, from the fireworks to the
searchlights to the white lights
strung in the trees took time to
hunt down and arrange their use.

Q: Did you have any goals for
this year’s Fancy Dress?

A: I have two goals for this FD:
one is to come under budget, and
the other is a goal I think every
FD chairman has had. That is, to-
have every person that walks into
the ball say it was the best one :
yet. ——

credible date that I do. I’m going

from W&L.

kingdom. In the process, however,
he made a grave mistake. The
wife of King Lot of Orkney came
to Camelot to spy for her hus-
band. She was a beautiful woman,
and Arthur fell in love with her.
He propositioned the lady; she
agreed, They made love and that
night the queen of Orkney con-
ceived a child. The queen’s name
was Morguase. We have already
been introduced to her. The child
was called Mordred.

During his early days as king,
Arthur went about the countryside
engaging in adventures. It was
while on one of these adventures
that Arthur received Excalibur
from the Lady of the Lake. It
was also during these early days
that Arthur, fearful of prophecies,
which predicted that his destruc-
tion would be brought about by
the child begotten upon his sister,
decreed that all children bom
around May Day were to be put
into a boat. The boat then was sel

adrift. Eventually, it wrecked
upon rocks, and only one child,
Mordred, was spared.

down, and Arthur did so. He
married Guenevere, the daughter
of King Leodegrance of Camel-
ard, a woman whom he loved and
who also had the added bonus of
an excellent dowry, the Table
Round. Confined by responsibility
to Camelot, Arthur used the Table
Round as an extension of his
beliefs, ideas and power. It was a
highly successful endeavor. Ar-
thur’s new order of knighthood
attracted knights from all over
and the name of Arthur’s Camclot
became synonymous with honor,
power, generosity and other vir-
tues.

All things must come to an
end, however; and so it was with
Arthur. His best friend, Lancelot
du Lac, fell in love with Arthur’s
wife who loved Lancelot in re-
turn. Arthur, unwilling to lose his
best knight or his wife, ignored
the situation for as long as possi-
ble, until Agravaine of Orkney
and his younger brother Mordred
forced Arthur to pay allention to
the matter.

Thus it was that Lancelot was
found in the Queen’s bed cham-

 

ber while the king was hunting in
the forest. The fall of the Round
Table had begun. Revealed as
traitor to her husband, Guenevere
was tried by Arthur and sentenced
to death by burning. At the stake
itself, she was rescued by her
lover who, in the process, killed
two members of the Orkncy clan,
Gareth and Gahcris. Arthur could
do no more.

Arthur chased Lancelot to
Benwick leaving Mordred, his
son, as regent in Britain. While in
Benwick, he received word that
the prophecy had come to pass;
his son was his bane. Mordred

tured against Arthur. Claiming
Arthur to be dead, he had tried to
marry Guenevere whom Arthur
had taken back by express com-
mand of the Pope. Arthur rushed
back to Britain and engaged his
son in several battles which cul-
minated at Camlann. Camlann
was a battle which was nearly
averted.

Arthur, in one last attempt to
save his kingdom, called a parley
with Mordred. Neither man
trusted the other, and each warn-
ed his men to be on guard. Ar-
thur and Mordred struck a deal
and were just about to seal the
contract when one of Mordred’s
lieutenants pulled out his sword to
kill a snake that had stung him.

The sight of bare steel was all
the overwrought forces needed to
see; battle commenced. At the end
of the battle, Arthur saw Mord-
red surrounded by corpses leaning
on his sword. Arthur, spear in
hand, charged his son and skew-
ered him through the body. With
his dying strength, Mordred heav-
ed himself farther along Arthur’s
spear, swung his sword, seriously
wounding his father in the head,
and then died.

His blood mingling with that
of his son, Arthur calls Sir Beve-
dere, the last of his knights left
alive, and instructs Bevedere to
take Excalibur and throw it into

the nearby lake. Bevedere sets off
to do so, but doesn’t do so twice
because he covets the beautiful
weapon; finally, at the third time,
he does throw Excalibur back. An
arm rises from the waters and
catches Excalibur three times.
Arthur is then carried away by
weeping queens in a barge to the
Isle of Avalon where his wound
is to be healed.

Some reports say that the
queens were not successful, and
that Arthur died at Avalon that
night. Others say that Arthur still
lives and sleeps on in Avalon or
the Welsh mountain fortress. In a
time of distress, he will arise
from this sleep in order to save
Britain.

This is the Arthur of romance.
For the most part, he is often
overshadowed by his knights or
their deeds, but one must remem-
ber that even though he may not
have fought another knight for a
year, Arthur is always the focal
point. It is he and no one else
who is able to reconcile and hold
together the diverse parts of the
fellowship.

nity’s river or country houses. A

you need some sleep.

But that doesn’t happen be-
cause you have another band that
night. In the spirit of FD, the
fraternities get the best band they
can and do their best to have a

party worthy of the social proba-
tion they will receive.

The end of the night marks
the end of Fancy Dress and the
end of a magical weekend that
has been enjoyed by Washington
and Lee students for decades.

As the dates leave and the
party smells linger in the air, the
remaining students reflect on what
they have uniquely experienced.
This year let’s continue the tradi-
tion, noticing the events that make
Fancy Dress the proud Washing-
ton and Lee tradition it is.

e

 

Q: Is it true that the budget
for decorations is more than
$45,000? At my high school
prom, the only decorations we
had were streamers and some
lousy balloons. What gives?

A: Obviously you have not yet
become familiar with the lore and
tradition of Fancy Dress. When
you enter Doremus on the night
of FD, you will find that the gym
has been transformed into a magi-
cal realm of wonder and delight.
Of course by the time many
people have entered the gym, they
are already in a little magical
realm of their own. The 45 plus
grand is mainly used to clean up
after these people.

Q: Why is the FD theme
kept a secret until the week
before? What’s the big deal?

A: Due to the fact that FD is
brought to you by the same
‘people who are in charge of
Fraternity Renaissance and the
Lenfest Center, the theme isn’t
even decided until the week be-
fore. The ‘secret theme’? idea is
just a hoax.

Q: Is the cost of FD covered

by my financial aid? If not,
what should I do?

A: Unless you filled out the
university’s Social Activities
Compensation application back in
the fall (also known as the No-
One-Told-Me-I-Had-To-Buy-
@#$*&#@$-T-Shirts-Too form),
you’re not covered. However, a
little-known fact is that FD is tax-
deductible. Just remember to
make your checks out to “W&L
Fancy Dress Ball and Homeless
Leper Orphan Fundraiser.’’

Q: What should I wear?

A: Contrary to popular belief,
this is not another occasion at
which all the males in the room
will be wearing navy blue blazers
and tan pants, The proper attire
for guys at FD is a tuxedo. Thus
all the males in the room will
still be dressed alike, while fe-
males will be wearing dresses
which, in most cases, had to be
financed through a bank.

Students who are still fairly
clueless and have additional ques-
tions should call the FD Info
Hotline, 1-800-LOTS-O-MONEY.

my mother slowly.

Then there was the fundamen-
tal conflict that my date and |
had about the verb ‘‘to plan’’. In
short, I don’t think he realized it
existed (despite my repeated nagg-
ing to remind him of the fact). |
had to plan everything-- where we
went for dinner, who’s place we
pre-partied at, what we were
going to do on Saturday night. I
even ordered my own corsage.
Thank God he owned a tuxedo
and didn’t have to expend any
effort planning to rent one, or I
might have been in trouble. Big
deal, you say, so I had to call up
a restaurant and make reserva-
tions,

Well, it wouldn’t have been so
bad except that I think the one
thing my date did plan was to
complain about all my plans, right
down to refusing to pay for my
corsage because he didn’t like the
one that I picked out (I had to
get one to match the ‘“‘prom
revisited’ dress, didn't I?) My
most vivid memory of Sophomore
FD is gliding through Gaines Hall
in my floor length gown yelling
“Shut up! You're ruining my
FD’’ I'd like to tell you I had
fun after that, but I wish I didn’t
remember.

Junior year I was in Austria,
so I have no F, D. stories to
report. I did have fun on the
night of the ball, however. I was
at a University Fest (huge party

that makes a frat party look like
aftemoon tea) dancing with one
of the most beautiful men I’ve
ever set eyes on. He sang-- well,
actually yelled in my ear-- Sinead
O’Connor’s ‘‘Nothing Compares
to You’’, which with an Austrian
accent sounds like ‘‘No-zing
Cumpaars to You”’.

The next night I got incredibly
homesick thinking of all my
friends at FD I consoled myself
with the fact that my wonderful
friends sent me an FD care pack-
age with a t-shirt, Phi supple-
ment, cup, and a poster that hung
for the rest of the term on my
closet door. I did go to Salzburg
University’s ball that year, but
that’s a another story, even more
heinous than sophomore year FD.
(But maybe in the future I'll
write an article about my ex-
periences Slam-waltzing.)

So this year I’m determined to
actually have fun at one of these
things, especially since I’ve got a
black velvet dress that my mother
had no part in picking out. After
all, this is my last chance. 1
nearly panicked when the Phi ran
a story about how FD might be
canceled due to the war in the
gulf. The very thought renewed
my dedication to my _ pacifist
sentiments.

So look for me March 8th.
I'll be the one with the evening
bag that looks like a rock.

surely written to haunt the ner-
vous minds of freshmen. Every
member of the opposite sex one
meets is appraised for FD date
potential.

Other FD anxieties for the
first-time FD-goer include having
the right dress or tuxedo
(although I doubt that you guys
get as excited about finding an
awesome tux as girls do about
having the perfect dress.)

And then, what about know-
ing how to ballroom dance? I
have to admit, those signs that
went up weeks ago advertising

ballroom dancing lessons really
scared me. But I guess that will
just make FD all the more fun...
and different from any other
dance we have ever attended.

Of course, as we have been
told all along, FD is no ordinary
social event. We’ll just have to
wait another week to find out just
how extraordinary it is. All we
can do until then is anticipate...
and listen to our new Bo Did-
dley tapes to find out just what
that guy on the Nike commer-
cials sings, and wonder what the
theme will be...

King Arthur and his half-sister
Queen Morguase of Orkncy is an
even worse scenario.

In Le Morte D’ Arthur, Mor-
dred displays a wonderfully dual
personality. In the first half, he
is being everything a good knight
should be, good on the battleficld,
fair in judgement and courteous
of speech. Somewhere, however,
before we meet him again, he
changes radically and becomes a
scheming fiend.

Whatever Mordred’s character
defects are as far as subterfuge
goes, all sources give him credit
for being a man of great person-
al courage. Interestingly enough,

Mordred is one of the characters
whose name has co-existed with
that of Arthur since the Welsh
Triads.

Sir Gawain of Lothian and
Orkney, the son of King Lot and
Queen Morguase, has the reputa-
tion of being one of the most
courteous knights of the Round
Table. He also has the reputa-
tion of being quite the lover and
his sexual exploits whether good,
bad, or uninteresting become the
stuff of legend.

Gawain is indisputably flaw-
ed, but that is what is charming
about him. He is totally human.
He has his up days and his down

days, his moments of triumph
and his moments of defeat, his
times of glory and his times of
shame, and everybody knows it.

Whatever the case, Gawain
takes everything that happens to
him in stride. Galahad eschews
earthly existence; Gawain revels
in it.

Five men and one angel.
Some are loved; some are de-
spised; some are good; some are
not so good. But whatever the
flaws, these ten knights were all
part of Arthur’s great experi-
ment, and all contributed threads
to the tapestry of the life of Ar-
thur.
