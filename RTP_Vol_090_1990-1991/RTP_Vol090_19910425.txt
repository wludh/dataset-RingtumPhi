LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

| McGovern to kick off "92 Convention

 

By Spain Brumby
Staff Reporter

Possible 1992 presidential candidate and
former senator George McGovern will kick off
the 20th W&L Mock Convention Friday with a
speech on Lee Chapel Lawn at 12 p.m.

‘‘McGovern has taken a keen interest in
college students in the past,’’ MC Political
Chairman James Tucker said.

McGovern has said he will run for President
if he can raise $5,000 in each of 20 states by
May and if no other Democrat who shares his
views gets into the race, according to a
Washington Post article.

‘‘He is one of the only people who has
shown interest in the Democratic nomination,”’
MC Speakers Chairman Edward ‘‘Ted’’ Elliot
said. ‘‘He is a dynamic speaker and well
respected among Washington insiders."

MC has been wrong only once since 1948
in choosing the Presidential nominee for the
party out of office.

In 1972, W&L MC delegates chose Sen.
Edward Kennedy over McGovern as_ the
convention’s proposed nominee. McGovern went
on to win the nomination.

McGovern sought the Democratic
nomination again in 1984, but the party chose
Walter Mondale.

McGovern served as a senator from South

Dakota for 18 years. First elected in 1962, he
served on the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee and the Agriculture, Nutrition, and
Forestry Committee.

Prior to his political career McGovern flew
35 missions in World War II and was decor-
ated with the Distinguished Service Flying
Cross.

McGovern’s speech is part of four days of
events to gather student support and national
recognition for the Mock Convention next
March.

‘*We are hoping for a good student turnout
this spring,’’ MC Public Relations Chairman
Talley Woolley said. ‘Kickoff is a dry run for
the March convention to see what works and

what doesn’t.’’

In conjunction with the’ MC kickoff, the
Student Activities Board will cosponsor a
Friday night performance by MTV personality
Pauly Shore.

SAB executive member John Flippen said,
‘‘We are hoping to have good attendance since
it is for Mock Convention. I saw [Shore] per-
form during February break and he was
hilarious.”’

On Sunday, Down Boy Down and W&L
student bands will perform from 1-6 p.m. in
the Dell between the library and Woods Creek.

‘*We hope this week gives everyone a good
preview of Mock Convention and spurs more
interest and involvement,’’ Tucker said.

Sorority members will not have to
pay the Greek fee for the 1991-92
academic year, according to Presi-
dent John Wilson. Wilson waived the
fee until the fall of 1992-93 un-
der the advice of University Trea-
surer Lawrence Broomall.

‘‘Our commitment to the sororities
to provide other space available for
them, namely the renovation of the
Troubador Theater into offices,
hasn’t’’ been fulfilled, Broomall said.

He said the university decided to
renovate the old theater last spring.
Funding was set aside and a budget
approved on July 1. Broomall an-
nounced in October that the second

sorority fee

Each sorority member was to be
required to pay $100 each year until
they have housing, which is still
several years down the road.

But for now, Wilson and Broo-
mall feel that before sororities are
forced to pay the Greek fee, they
should at least get the office space
they have been promised.

Panhellenic President Dale Wyatt
expressed her approval of President
Wilson’s recent decision to waive the
fee.

‘I’m pleased that we don’t have
to pay next year since the construc-
tion on Troubador Theater has not
begun,’’ Wyatt said, ‘‘but I can see it
being feasible to have to pay once
we get some office space or hous-
ing.”’

Dean of Students David Howison

According to Williams, the committee decided
it would not disclose the names of the people
who voted for or against keeping the term.

Students seem to be pleased with the commit-
tee’s decision.

‘It’s a nice break from the traditional 12
week-semester,’’ said senior Tom Lovell. ‘‘It lets
you expand on other activities such as Goshen
[Pass] and Panther Falls.’’

According to senior Rob Christensen, the

floor of the renovated theater would
be designated as sorority offices, but
progress since then has been slow.
Broomall said progress on the
theater will be reevaluated next win-

designed by Buildings and Grounds

EC funds ACLU open mike

By Greg Patterson
Staff Reporter

 

The Executive Committee Monday
allocated only $30 of $500 requested
by the newly-formed W&L chapter of
the American Civil Liberties Union
after debate over whether the group
was partisan and whether it intended
to limit itself to local issues.

The ACLU chapter originally
made the request at the April 8 EC
meeting. The $500 requested was
budgeted for stationery, printing,
stamps, telephone costs, and speakers’

meals.

At that meeting, the last one
before spring break, ACLU Chapter
President and Founder Andrew
Schneider responded to concerns that
the EC would be supporting the
national ACLU by saying that the 80-
90 members of the chapter had
already paid five dollars each in order
to pay the national dues. He said the
chapter was seeking operational costs
only.

Schneider said he had assured
new chapter members the national
dues would be the only cost they
would have to pay.

EC Vice President Raymond
Welder then raised the issue of
whether the ACLU was a partisan
political organization, a type of group
the EC traditionally does not fund.

‘If the ACLU is not a partisan
group, then tell me why it was an
issue in the 1988 presidential cam-
paign,’’ Welder said.

Patrick McDermott, ACLU
chapter treasurer, said the ACLU was
‘tmade an issue by George Bush. We
did not want it to be an issue.’’

McDermott said, ‘‘Our [chapter]
bylaws, the state bylaws, and the na-
tional bylaws say we’re non-parti-

Ls

san.

The EC tabled the issue until after
the spring break.

At Monday’s meeting, Hatcher
asked the chapter representatives
about a poster put up around campus
by the ACLU chapter conceming
abortion laws in Utah. He questioned
the group’s statement that it would
stick to local issues.

Schneider said the intent of the
posters was not to make an issue of
abortion, but to question the constitu-
tionality of a Utah law which made

Law policy reversed

, By Tom Eisenhauer
Staff Reporter

 

. Washington and Lee University President

John D. Wilson repealed a ban prohibiting
‘ military recruitment on the Law School cam-
+ pus.

In a March 27 letter to Randall Bezanson,
‘dean of the Law School, Wilson said that “the
, University’s best interest requires us to suspend

the application of [the] placement policy to the
‘military services."

The Law School had been racked with
‘controversy over the law faculty’s February
, decision to prohibit employers who discriminate
against homosexuals, legally or otherwise, from

fusing the Law School’s placement facilities.
The faculty acted in accordance with a man-
"date of the Association of American Law
,Schools, with which the Law School is
accredited. Last year the U.S. Supreme Court
‘upheld the military’s ban on homosexuals.
, Wilson said he exempted the military
because the AALS policy focuses upon the
‘legal discrimination of the military’s Judge
Advocate General Corps.

‘The JAG Corps was the obvious intended
‘target of [the AALS] policy,’’ Wilson said in
his letter. ‘‘No other employer I know of has
‘an explicit = anti-homosexual _ personnel
policy...and [the military] has a record of court
approval of its policies.”

The university is suffering, the Wilson

'

on president's order

letter said, ‘‘because many of its loyal friends
are puzzled and distressed that their university
appears to have placed itself in opposition to a
lawful agency of the government.”’

‘It seemed to me that the AALS was using
its accreditation authority to focus upon what it
took to be a desirable change in the military
services personnel policy,’’ Wilson said. ‘‘This
is a long way from what an accreditation body
ought to be doing.’’

Bezanson said accreditation by the AALS,
one of the nation’s two premier law school
accrediting agencies, is ‘‘quite important.”’

Bezanson said the Law School could lose
AALS accreditation, but it is not likely.

‘‘There’s not a strong likelihood they will
try to enforce the policy through
accreditation...but I think there is a risk,”’
Bezanson said.

He also said W&L might be censured or
publicly reprimanded by the AALS.

These risks are tempered by the refusal of
a significant number of law schools to fully
implement the AALS policy, Bezanson said.

‘I think any action by the AALS is going
to be difficult against the background that
roughly a quarter of the member schools had
[the policy] reversed at the level of the presi
dent,’’ Bezanson said.

Wilson said all of Virginia’s law schools

University, the College of William and Mary

From Wooster Sports Information

 

 

William D. McHenry, director of
physical education at Washington and
Lee University, has been named
director of physical education, ath-
letics and recreation at the College of
Wooster in Ohio.

McHenry will succeed Al Van
Wie, who is retiring July 1 from the
position he has held for 17 years.

The announcement of McHenry’s
appointment was made by R. Stanton
Hales, vice president for academic
affairs at Wooster.

‘We are excited to have Bill
McHenry coming to Wooster,” said
Hales. ‘‘He brings a wealth of ex-
perience in intercollegiate athletics
and physical education as well as a
strong commitment to the ideals of
the NCAA Division III philosophy.’’

‘TI am extremely excited about
coming to Wooster,’’ said McHenry.
“IT have the utmost respect for the
superb job that Al Van Wie has done
over the years and am delighted to
have the chance to continue in that
tradition of excellence. I look forward
to being associated with Wooster and,
through the College, with the North
Coast Athletic Conference.”’

A 1954 graduate of W&L, Mc-
Henry spent the past 20 years here
as director of athletics (1971-89) and
director of physical education (1989-
present).

Professionally, McHenry has been
very active on a national level. He
was the NCAA Football Committee
Chairman from 1983-89 and
chaired the NCAA Committee on
Competitive Safeguards and Medical
Aspects of Sports (1980-85) as well

(1988-90). In addition, he served on
the NCAA Football Rules Committee
(1976-81), the Classification Commit-
tee (1977-82) and the Lacrosse Rules
Committee (1974-76)

McHenry will begin his duties at
Wooster on July 1
 

OPINION

The readers
have spoken

So you think we’re sensationalist, immature, shallow,
chest-beating, rhetorical, unreliable, prone to pouting,
National Enquirer-esque, boring and ugly. Those were just
some of the words you readers used to describe the Phi in
last month’s Readership Survey.

First, we'd like to thank the readers who took the time
to fill out the survey and return it to us. We have
considered your suggestions, and your time and trouble
will be rewarded.

Three big complaints about the Phi’s content were that
too much time was devoted to covering fraternities, not
enough time was spent on national or world news, and
that many campus organizations and activities were not
being given adequate coverage.

Over 75 percent of W&L men are in fraternities, and
over half of W&L women in sororities. Those numbers
tell us we must continue extensive coverage of Greek life
at the university, so we do not plan to step-down
coverage of this vital aspect of W&L. As for national or
world news, we do not want to, nor could we hope to
compete with national and city dailies. We simply don’t
have the money to set up a, say, London or New Delhi
bureau. And no one on our staff wanted to go to Baghdad
to cover the war. As a W&L newspaper we will cover
W&L news.

We agree with the complaint that we don’t adequately
cover the broad range of activities and organizations on
campus. We, too, have noticed a lack of stories about
W&L’s many cultural and academic activities. While we
want to expand coverage of these events and will try to
do so, our editorial decisions must reflect our readers’
interests and our finite staff and resources. But let us
know what your group is doing and we’ll try to cover
it; if people read the story, we’ll cover it the next time
too.

By far the biggest complaint about the paper was its
circulation (or lack thereof). We’re somewhat heartened to
hear that people actually get upset about not being able to
find a copy of the Phi. At least that means you want to
read it. We have a new circulation manager working hard

on a new distribution system to ensure everyone gets
copies of the paper promptly. Fraternities need not send
anyone to pick up copies of the Phi, as they will be
delivered earlier. Moreover, we remind everyone picking
up their own copies that there should be no need to
remove whole bundles. Take only what you will use, or
we will consider it stealing.

As for faculty and staff, if all other papers go out
smoothly, there’ll be no need for students to take papers

out of faculty. mailboxes, as they sometimes do. We also |

remind the staff. that we are the student newspaper of
W&L and as such we feel our primary responsibility is to
get copies to the students. We’ll try to make sure you
have copies, too, but students must be our first priority
since it is their money that helps finance the Phi.
University offices that require extra copies can arrange
delivery and billing through the circulation manager.

A few other things you wanted from us: more coverage
of all sports, comics or a crossword, in-depth coverage of
the big, ongoing issues on campus, more human interest
stories, EC voting records, restaurant reviews, a crime
report, a monthly issues and ideas forum insert, and
recycled paper. We can’t promise everything, but we will
try our best. We’ve planned some major changes for when
the paper returns in the fall, and we continue to welcome
your suggestions, comments, and criticisms.

A Christian view of race

 

MY VIEW
By Ted Smith

A University of Chicago survey showed that
while most whites support racial equality, they
still hold negative stereotypes toward blacks.
62.2 percent of whites polled thought that
blacks were less hard-working than whites. 56.1
percent thought blacks were more violence-
prone than whites. 53.2 percent believed that
blacks were less intelligent. 77.7 percent
believed that blacks were more likely to be on
welfare. 50.6 percent believed that blacks were
less patriotic.

Galatians 3:28 states: ‘‘There is neither Jew
nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there
is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in
Christ Jesus.’’ Despite this, Christians,
historically speaking, have not been able to
cross the barrier of race. Thousands of blacks
were brought to this country on a ship called
Jesus. Many slavemasters whipped their slaves,
while quoting from the Bible. Certain Africans
noted: ‘‘When they (whites) came, they had the
Bible and we had the land. Now we have the
Bible, and they have the land.’’ Christians have
a very poor record historically, and things have
not improved that much today. What is the
most segregated hour of the week? The hour of
Sunday morning worship. Yet, we do not even
deal with this issue, and when we do, we do it
in a sugar-coated fashion. Will anyone give me
a good reason for this? The word of God is
supposed to dig to the very core of a person.
Why can we not, both blacks and whites, deal
with the racism pervading our Christian
institutions? If we can only deal with the
surface of this issue, it must indicate that we

 

only have a surface Christianity, which is not
true to Christ or God’s Word.

These abuses have not been limited to
whites; there have been many black abuses.
One can read accounts of a 19th century black
slave using a vision from God to justify killing
innocent white women and children. One can
also read about a noted bishop in the AME
(African Methodist Episcopal) Church that said,
‘‘God is a Negro.’’ These instances are also not
limited to the 19th century. Recently, a noted
black Christian leader has made some anti-
Jewish remarks. I could name more examples,
but the point is the same — blacks have also
committed racist abominations.

I yearn for both blacks and whites to come
together and explore the racism in our
institutions. If we do, then we will find fault on
the sides of both races (I do not want anyone
to think that as far as racism is concerned that
I’m placing all the blame on whites, because
racism exists on both sides). I challenge us to
face the truth! Too often we refuse to face it
because it makes us feel guilty. If the truth

_makes us feel. guilty, then we need to realize.,

that Jesus Christ’s death onthe cross declared
us ‘‘not guilty.’’ I hope that his death on the
cross is special enough to help us Christians to
face the truth.

For many years, the races have not been
able to communicate truthfully with each other
because of a lack of understanding. To remedy
this situation, we need to collectively engage in
study of each other’s culture. This will allow us
to appreciate each other’s culture, and we can
begin to have cross-cultural dialogues. Upon
understanding one another, we can work
together to examine the racism in our Christian
institutions. Then, and only then, will Christians
represent the unsearchable love of Jesus Christ.

EC should not
fund partisan
organizations

MY VIEW
By Charles Kranich

 

 

The recent decision by the Executive Committee to ,
fund the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sets a
dangerous precedent for all Washington and Lee stu-
dents. While the amount of the allotment was not sig-
nificant, it is irrelevant considering the principles deter- °
mined to advance an ideological agenda through the,
courts.

As William Donohue points out in The Politics of the '
American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU asserts that ,
the death penalty is unconstitutional, and has challenged
the tax exempt status of religious institutions. The ACLU ‘
also deems laws which outlaw pornography, gambling, ,
and the use of certain drugs unconstitutional. They even
maintain that metal detectors should be removed from '
airports on constitutional grounds. The ACLU, in fact, ,
could be described as a party of leftist lawyers bent on
changing our society, not through the people’s legi-'
slatures, but instead through unelected courts. For public .
relations reasons, the ACLU attempts to present themsel-
ves as non-political in spite of these many other facts.
One tends to doubt that they found their definition of
‘‘partisan’’ in Mr. Webster’s dictionary. ;

Beyond being political, however, the ACLU is con-,
sidered to be on the fringe by the standards of most
Americans. The success George Bush achieved by criti-'
cizing Michael Dukakis as a ‘‘card-carrying member of,
the ACLU”’ is testimony to the unpopular nature of this
organization. Bush made an effective argument that’
Dukakis’ financial endorsement of the ACLU signified,
his approval of that organization’s convictions. And now,
by committing students funds to the ACLU, seven!
members of the EC have forced the collective student,

body to endorse this

that two of these members opposed the funding of The’

it was ‘‘political.’’ Although I am a former senior editor
of the Spectator, 1 agreed with the very sound decision,
of a prior Executive Committee not to fund the magazine
on.those grounds, as it was.an appropriate precedent. The!
Spectator has definite opinions about both W&L and the,
world around W&L. Some members of our community
do not agree with the views of the Spectator, that is their’
right. The EC has no right whatsoever to commit money,
from the Student Activities Fund, into which all students
pay, to such an organization. The dramatic about-face by‘
some EC members empowers students with the ability to,
see which of their elected officials would rather practice
political compromise than maintain principle. ‘

More than ever, groups that go to the Executive
Committee act as if it were a wealthy charitable trust
giving out money to any group with whora they sym-)
pathize. The EC must realize that they are there to serve
the collective interest of their constituents. The ACLU
does not! ‘

KA Disputes
Parody Picture

To the Phi staff:

We understand your objective in the April
Fool’s edition of the Phi --- to bring humorous
stories to the reader as a relief from the pres-
sures of the end of the term. But we, the Broth-
ers of Kappa Alpha, and hopefully all of the
readers, believe you fell short of this objective in
your printing a picture of a Ku Klux Klan rally
with the underlying caption, ‘‘Kappa Kappa
Kappa Alpha.’’ We find your equation of our
ideals with the racist sentiments of the Klan both
offensive and degrading. This is a representative
not of KA, but rather of a distorted sense of
humor. It is an unfortunate reflection of the Phi
and an unflattering stereotype of our Order.

KA has put many hours of work and dedica-
tion into philanthropic endeavors this year. Our
projects include: sending members to the Gladys
House (a local house for the homeless) to spend
the night making sure that none of the visitors
are drinking, doing drugs or causing problems
with others staying there; sponsoring a city-wide
basketball tournament to benefit Muscular Dys-
trophy; volunteering as coaches for RARO
(Rockbridge Area Recreational Organization); and
holding a Christmas party for the children of the
less fortunate members of the community who
otherwise may not have had any sort of Christ-
mas at all. Following this party, most of the
Brothers stayed until after dark, playing with the
kids until their parents were ready to take them
home. I believe that every Brother has benefitted
from these activities and was glad to be in-
volved.

As most people know, KAs around the
country hold an annual Old South weekend. KA
was founded here at Washington and Lee while
it was still Washington College and Robert E.
Lee was president. Our Order’s founding fathers
based the ideals of KA on those of Lee, and
named him our Spiritual Founder. These are the
same ideals which make this a unique university.
Old South is a celebration of this Southern
tradition of honor, duty and honesty. Just as Lee
was not an advocate of slavery, Old South is not
a celebration of that aspect of the antebellum
South,

The purpose of this letter is not to exalt our
Chapter of KA, but rather to state our disap-
pointment in the judgement of the Phi staff. We

have been trying very hard to do our part for the
community this year, and we are very unap-
preciative of the fact that our stature and reputa-
tion within that community has been unjustly
jeopardized. It is a shame that an otherwise
entertaining edition had to be marred by such a
mistake. I only hope that the Phi acts more
responsibly in the future.

Sincerely,
Hunter Williams
President, Kappa Alpha

Former Editor
Apologizes

Dear Editors:

I would like to apologize to the members of
Kappa Alpha for printing a photograph and
caption relating their fraternity to the Ku Klux
Klan in the April 1 issue of The Ring-tum Phi. |
certainly made a mistake by allowing a portrayal
casting damaging and unsubstantiated accusations
on the KAs. I am sorry for any anguish the
photo may have caused the KAs as a result of
my poor judgement.

Sincerely,
Pat Lopes

Upset Alum
Cuts Contribution

Dear Editor:

Enclosed please find a letter | recently mailed
to Mr. Brad Watkins (W&L '88 Class Agent). In
it, | explain my reasons for not contributing to the
Annual Fund.

1 would greatly appreciate the publication of
this in your paper.

Thank you.

Dear Brad:

While I appreciate the University’s need and
your invitation to contribute to Washington and
Lee’s Annual Fund, I regret that I won't be
forwarding a check.

What disturbs me, frankly, is the growing
intolerance on the part of the administration, and

many members of the faculty, to views that run
countercurrent to what they deem politically or
socially ‘‘correct.”’

Just recently I heard through the grapevine
that the administration has empowered a faculty-
led Confidential Review Committee to investigate
campus expression which, in the opinion of that
body, is ‘‘hostile’’ or ‘‘offensive.’’ What has
happened to critical thought, diversity of opinion,
and the right of free expression?

I’m enclosing a copy of a recent Time mag-
azine article for you to read and ponder. Can
W&L really afford such a policy?

I’m afraid that the only ‘‘correct’’ policy;
Brad, is that which allows people, whomever
they are, and whatever they believe, to express
themselves as they freely choose. Anything less,
sadly, is a willful disintegration of civil liberty.

I hope, very soon, that I'll feel comfortable ,
writing that check; contributing as much to a
principle as to the institution I hold so very dear.

Yours sincerely,
Sean L. Hickey, '88

Dear Ring-tum Phi:

We in the Politics Department would like to
protest your recent scandalous ‘‘Stud Poll.’’ We
are torn, however, between our outrage at the
politically incorrect sexism of said poll and our
disappointment at Professor Handelman’s fifth
place ranking. In our never ending effort to find
political corruption, even where there is none, we
are concerned that Brian Shaw’s first place
ranking may have something to do with his
position on the Publications Board overseeing the
Phi. We demand a recount.

More disappointed than outraged,
William Connelly

SAC proposes SCC revamp

 

By Greg Patterson
Staff Reporter

 

The Student Affairs Committee

' has proposed a number of changes to
, the procedure of the Student Conduct

Committee,

According to EC president and
SAC member Tom Hatcher, the pro-
posals ‘‘facilitate the use of the honor
code in the SCC and get away from
the legalistic aspect of the committee.
We're trying to make it less like
‘Perry Mason.’

“In the past, the legal advocate
for the defense has been able to

, argue the seriousness of the offense

and whether or not there were exten-
uating circumstances. The complainant
never had that chance. It’s been pret-
ty one-sided.”’

Law School
drops rank

From Staff Reports

 

 

W&L’s law school, which was
listed last year by U.S. News &
World Report among the nation’s top
25 law schools, did not make the
magazine's list this year. The state’s
only representative in the list was the
University of Virginia law school,
which moved to second from eighth
place.

A spokesman for the magazine
said W&L’s ranking could have been
affected by changes made this year in
the ranking criteria. He said most of
the universities which were listed in
the past but not included this year
have comparatively small enrollments.

Hatcher said the proposals would
allow the advocate who represents the
accused student to help prepare the
opening and closing arguments in a
hearing, but that most of the defense
will be the responsibility of the
student.

Changes in the SCC must be
approved by the faculty. Hatcher said
faculty members will meet with the
SAC about the proposed changes and
will vote on the proposals in a facul-
ty meeting.

Lackluster CRC forum

A discussion forum about the
Confidential Review Committee held
in late March drew little student
attendance and almost no debate.

The forum, billed by Executive
Committee President Tom Hatcher as

“‘educational’’ in purpose, consisted
mostly of an explanation of the CRC
process presented by Dr. Nancy
Margand, Associate Professor of
Psychology, Prof. Ann Massie, As-
sistant Professor of Law, who are
both on the CRC, and Dr. Samuel
Kozak, Professor of Geology, who
chaired the committee which revised
the CRC in 1987.

Dean of Students David Howison
said that 12 cases had been handled
on an informal basis during this
academic year, but none had gone
through the full process leading to a
confidential hearing.

Referendum rescheduled

The referendum on revisions to
the student body constitution that was
scheduled for April 3 will be held on

May 1, said Hatcher.

According to him, the referendum
was not held on the original, publi-
cized date because Voting Regu-
lations Board President Andrew Gaff-
ney forgot about the referendum and
did not set up the polling places.

The proposed changes were rec-
ommended by the Constitutional
Revisions Committee and approved
by the EC or were put on the ballot
because they were backed by a peti-
tion signed by 50 students.

Each proposal requires two-thirds
voter approval to pass with at least
half the student body voting. Some of
the proposals address succession
procedures, executive sessions and
quorum of the EC, as well as the
autonomy and make up of the Public-
ations Board.

Two seniors to join staff

 

By Joshua Manning
Staff Reporter

 

The Admissions Office asked seniors Rob Aliff and
Timothy Halloran last week to join the university staff
upon graduation.

Aliff and Halloran will serve as admissions counselors
interviewing prospective students and assisting in next
winter’s freshmen selection process.

The two were chosen from a large pool of applicants.

‘While all were extremely well-qualified, we thought
Tim and Rob would best be able to represent W&L,”’
said Nancy Hickam, ’90, who has “Served as an
admissions counselor this year.

According to Hickam, both new counselors are
extremely outgoing and have a deep love for Washington
and Lee. They are also involved in strong leadership
positions in all different kinds of activities, she said.

‘The job is a very exciting and challenging position,’
Hickam said. ‘‘You work on many different types of
projects and meet all different kinds of people.”’

Throughout the summer, the new counselors will

interview prospective students coming to view the campus.

In the fall, the two will travel cross-country attending
college fairs, visiting high schools, working with alumni,
and conducting interviews.

Beginning in January, Aliff and Halloran will join the
rest of the admissions staff reading and reviewing student
applications. The entire office plays a role in making the
all-important decisions, Hickam said.

In April, the cycle starts over again with more
interviews.

While the position is generally offered for one year,
it can be extended.

Halloran said he was most excited by the chance to
travel.

“‘Such an opportunity right out of college is great,”’
Halloran said. ‘‘I’d like to go into college education or
administration. I think the admissions office will be a
great place to start.’’

Aliff feels he can portray W&L well to incoming
prospective.

‘‘Washington and Lee is a school that sells itself,’’
Aliff said. ‘I’m glad I can give back to the school in a
way best suiting my abilities.’’

Junior EC Rep. Caroline Wight
‘said the EC should try to support

, After more debate, the EC voted
7-5 to allot $30 to the chapter, the
“cost of publicizing Wednesday’s ‘‘o-

the University of Richmond, and
W&L= have now refused the AALS
demand to ban military recruiting
from their campuses.

Nonetheless, Bezanson said the
AALS continues to support adamantly
the ban against all employers who
discriminate against homosexuals.

“‘The AALS is [still] insisting that
the policy be implemented without
exception,’’ Bezanson said. ‘‘Indeed,
the AALS is now insisting that ma-
terials relating to the military be re-
moved from placement office librar-
ies.”’

Betsy Levin, executive director of
the AALS, told the Richmond Times-
Dispatch several weeks ago that she
had ‘‘no way of knowing what ef-
fect’’ failure to comply with the
AALS policy would have on any of
the schools.

Levin told the Richmond paper
that the AALS Executive Committee
can censure a school, but it prefers to
work out policy problems with
schools.

“(T]he approach of a membership
Organization is to try to get agree-
ment to policies and then where
schools have trouble with a policy,
the association works with schools to
see how can we correct this,’’ Levin
told the Times-Dispatch.

The chain of events leading to
Wilson’s action began in January
1991 when the full membership of
the AALS approved an edict requir-
ing schools to apply the anti-discrimi-
nation policy without exception, Be-
zanson said.

On Feb, 12 the law faculty in a
closed-door session voted to include
“sexual orientation, or any other
legally impermissible or irrelevant
ground’’ as criteria opposed by its
anti-discrimination policy.

Law students quickly expressed
their opposition to the new policy.
Michael Carlson, ’92L, presented the
Executive Committee with a petition
calling for the law faculty to recon-
sider their amendment. The petition
was signed by about 60 percent of
the law students.

The EC unanimously condemned
the policy on Feb. 25.

Following the law faculty’s first
vote, two proposed amendments
which would exempt the military
from the ban failed, the second on a
10-10 vote in a March 4 closed-door
faculty meeting, a law professor said.
The professor said Bezanson, the
chairman of the law faculty meetings,
refused to cast a vote to break the
te.

Generals top WC 10-9

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

The Washington and Lee men’s
lacrosse team won a ‘‘big’’ game,
winning at Washington College 10-9
last Saturday.

‘This may be the biggest win
since I’ve been here,’’ said head
coach Jim Stagnitta. ‘‘We beat a
team on the road that really needed
to win. It’s the first time we've taken
a game that we really needed to
take.’’

WA&L fell behind quickly 2-1 just
under two minutes into the game
before the defense took over. The
Generals held the Shoremen scoreless
for the next 39:23 while taking a 5-
2. lead in the third quarter.

Washington College, ranked ninth
in Division IH, rallied in the fourth
quarter, cutting the lead to 10-9. The
Shoremen had a chance to send the
game into overtime, but senior goalie
Tom Costello stopped Greg Rupert’s
point-blank shot with eight seconds
left to preserve the win, W&L’s first
over WC since 1984.

Costello was solid all afternoon
for the Generals, finishing with 12
saves.

‘*When Tom makes the first save
early, it changes the whole game,”’
said Stagnitta. ‘‘He made some really
big saves."’

Offensively, the Generals followed
the game play, and that pleased Stag-
nitta almost as much as Costello’s
final save.

“I was happy offensively,’’ he

said. ‘‘We worked the ball around
and shot lay-ups. They have the best
goalie in the nation, and they sit back
in a zone and make you shoot from
12-15 yards and let him make the
saves. We just waited until we had a
lay-up, and he never had a chance.”’

W&L converted 10 of 25 shots on
the day. Junior Drew Anton made life
miserable for Dave Slomkowski, a
three-time All-American in goal for
the Shoremen. He led the way with
three goals while playing crease at-
tack. Slomkowski made a career-low
two saves.

Seniors Todd Garliss and Mike
Moseman, along with junior Jeff
Roberts each scored twice, and senior
Clark Wight also scored. Moseman
added three assists.

‘Going in, Coach [Stagnitta] told
us we had to be patient, to work the
ball around the zone,’’ said Mose-
man. ‘‘We tried to get eight to 10
yard shots. We got them, and we
converted them.’’

With the win, the 6th-ranked
Generals control their own destiny to
reach the NCAA Tournament. The
top eight teams in the nation receive
bids to the tournament.

‘‘Now we have our fate in our
hands,’’ said Stagnitta. ‘‘A lot of
people will see this win as a good
win for us. WC is a tough place to
win.”

‘Tt was a big win because we
knew after losing to Gettysburg and
Ohio Wesleyan, we couldn’t lose
another game if we wanted to make
the playoffs,’’ said Moseman. ‘‘That
made this game a marquis match-

up.
Ohio Wesleyan and Gettysburg are
ranked second and third in Division
Ill.

But despite the win, W&L (8-3)
still has three games left on the sch-
edule, all of which they need to win
to make certain of a bid.

‘*‘We got through the Washington
College game, but we still have three
very important games left,’’ said
Moseman.

W&L played at Virginia Wesleyan
on Wednesday and will take on
Hampden-Sydney Saturday before
playing VMI in the Lee-Jackson
Classic on May 4.

Stagnitta won’t let the team rest
on the laurels of its five wins over
ranked teams in Division III.

‘Practice after the Washington
game was great,’’ he said. ‘‘I won’t
let them look past anyone. We know
we've got to go out and play. Every
game is the season.’’

 

Baseball blows late lead in
playoff loss to Bridgewater

 

 

By Phil Spears
Staff Reporter

 

Early in the 1991 baseball
campaign Washington and Lee
head coach Jeff Stickley evaluated
his young team.

‘‘We’re playing pretty good 90
per cent of the time,’’ he said.
“The other 10 per cent just
seems to get us all at once.
We've got to be able to put
teams away.”

A greatly improved offense
and fine pitching from junior
hurlers T.J. Daly and Steve Mo-
morella have allowed W&L to
give just about every opponent a
tough game.

However, lack of depth and
overall consistency in the pitch-
ing, and shaky defense, have
proven costly for the Generals.
W&L has been unable to con-
sistently put teams away all sea-
son, and perhaps the most painful
breakdown occurred in _ yester-
day’s opening-round Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference tourna-
ment game at Bridgewater.

Leading 12-11 with two outs
and a runner on first in the bot-
tom of the ninth, W&L seemed
on the verge of advancing to the
tournament’s semi-finals. But the
final out came one batter too late
for the Generals. The next-to-last
Eagle hitter in the ninth delivered

 

 

 

 

Chris Kavanagh

a game-tying triple.

Neither team scored in the
extra innings until the bottom of
the eleventh when a bases-loaded
walk sent the winning run home
for Bridgewater.

The painful loss spoiled a
tremendous offensive performance
for the Generals.

The 13-hit, 12-run barrage was
lead by senior Chris Kavanagh,
whose three hits included a two-
run homer and 4 RBI. Daly had
three hits, and Mike Steinbrook
and Brian Harper added two hits
apiece in the loss.

The Generals, 8-11 on the
season, travel to Shenandoah this
Tuesday for their season finale.

Every March, ESPN brings you
what seems like every championship
game of every college basketball
conference in what it calls Champion-
ship Week.

While there will be no television
lights, no prime time exposure and
certainly no Dick Vitale, the spring
athletic teams of Washington and Lee
enter their own Championship Week
with seven teams competing for Old
Dominion Athletic Conference titles
and NCAA Tournament bids.

The The Ring-tum Phi now offers
its preview of this weekend’s ODAC
tournament action. ’

First, it’s off to the links, where
the W&L golf team, ranked eighth
nationally, looks to defend its ODAC
Title of 1990 in Ashland, Va. at
Randolph-Macon. Last year’s ODAC
Golfer of the Year Clay Thomas
again leads the way, averaging 79
shots per round in 1991.

The Generals will need to out-
shoot Hampden-Sydney to repeat as
champions. H-SC has beaten W&I.

and most recently by four at the 15-

shot 320 in the invitational, finishing
second. Thomas finished third in the
invitational, shooting a 77.

Thomas, a junior, will get help
from classmates Jay McKnight and
Brad Thoburn, who has shot sub-80
rounds his last three times out. Senior
Brian Kopet rounds out the top four
scorers for the Generals.

W&L takes a 29-2 record into the
two-day championship, which began
today. The Generals will also look to
return to the NCAA Champicnships,
where they finished seventh last year.

The women’s lacrosse team may
be the hottest team on campus right
now. With a 12-3 win at Sweet Briar
on Wednesday, the Generals have
won eight of their last nine games
going into the ODAC Tournament.

The Generals, seeded third, will
host Sweet Briar, and despite the
convincing win on Wednesday, senior
Melinda Conkling is still a little
apprehensive about penciling the
Generals into Saturday’s semifinal.

‘‘We were concerned going into
Wednesday’s game because they
played Guilford close and we went to
triple overtime against Guilford,’’ she
said. ‘‘Despite the win, we're still
apprehensive because it looked like
they didn’t really care because they
knew they would have to play us on
Friday. We don’t know if that was
the real team we'll see on Friday.’’

Real team or not, W&L was im-

pressive on Wednesday. Senior
Shawn Wert scored seven goals and
sophomore Lisa Dowling handed out
six assists in the 12-3 win.

‘Sweet Briar was more competi-
tive than they were last year,’ said
Conkling, who added a goal and an
assist. ‘‘Our attack worked really well
against they’re zone. Shawn could do
no wrong, and Lisa did a great job
feeding everyone. They are both
scoring machines right now.”’

W&L takes the field Friday after-
noon at 4:30 on Liberty Hall Field.

The men’s tennis team is also in
Lexington this weekend, serving as
host for the ODAC Championships.
The Generals are ranked 12th in the
nation and have the No. 4 player in
the nation in senior Bill Meadows
and are looking for their seventh
straight ODAC Title.

Meadows, the defending NCAA
Division III doubles champion, says
W&L’s 5-13 record shouldn’t be
looked at negatively going into the
tournament.

‘‘We haven’t had a lot of wins,
but we have had a lot of close mat-
ches with some really good teams,’’
he said. ‘‘We’ve improved our level
of play, and that’s important. In
Florida last week, we only got one
team win, but everyone played well
and got their games together.’’

ODAC Tournament to solidify the

“If we don’t win decisively, it

should win fairly handily.”’

Meadows and classmate Reid
Manley have been helped in the top
six by the addition of two: freshman
who have played well during the
year. Rob MacNaughton has held the
No. 2 spot all year, and Richard
Yates and Robert Wein have been
mainstays as well. MacNaughton is
ranked 30th nationally.

For Meadows, the notoriety is
something he is proud of, especially
in singles.

‘I’m really pleased with my sin-
gles this year,’’ he said. ‘‘I had been
disappointed in my singles in my
career, but this year things are com-
ing together. I’ve always been over-
shadowed, and now I’ve finally got-
ten a chance to prove that I can play.
Breaks are going my way. I’m cer-
tainly not going to complain.”

Meadows and company would not

complain with their seventh straight
ODAC title this weekend. Play begins
Friday at 8:30 a.m. and runs all day
Friday and Saturday on the W&L
courts.

The women’s tennis team will
look to regain the ODAC title they
lost to Sweet Briar last year, and
with a 7-2 win over SBC on Tues-
day, the Generals look in good shape
to regain their crown.

W&L is also looking to get their
first ever NCAA Tournament _ bid
with what might be their deepest
team ever. When play begins today,
two ODAC champions from 1990
will not get to defend their titles in
1991.

“T feel like this year we have
more depth than we've had before,”’
said senior Jean Stroman, a two-time
ODAC Player of the Year. ‘‘I feel
very confident about the whole
team’s ability to win.’’

Senior captain Kelly Martone says
the addition of three freshmen to the
top six has helped.

“This is the strongest team I’ve
been on,”’ she said. ‘‘We’ve got three
super freshman, and we’ve beaten
everyone in the conference already.
We will be disappointed if we don’t
win.”’

The three freshman should all
make a serious run to capture their
respective flights. Genia Foster goes
into the tournament with just one loss
at No. 2, while Mary Nabers and
Kim Dickinson hold down the fifth
and sixth spots on the ladder.
Stroman, Martone and senior Kathy
Leake round out the top six.

The Generals are ranked third in
the South region, which puts added
pressure on the team to play well to
make the NCAA tournament.

‘The possibility that we'll get a
bid looks good,’’ said Martone. ‘‘The
tournament has added a two extra
wildcards, and that helps us. Winning

ODACs~ doesn’t guarantee us
anything. We'll just have to wait
and see.’’

The Generals, 18-1 on the season,
take the courts today at Sweet Briar.
Play concludes on Saturday.

The track teams are also riding
high going into the ODAC meet. The
men are 3-1 and the women are 6-0
on the season. Both are coming off
strong showings at the Catholic In-
vitational going into Saturday’s meet
at Eastern Mennonite.

The men are led by seniors David
Johnston, Jeff Baucum and Craig
Irons. Johnston won the pole vault at
Catholic, and Irons came in third in
the long jump. Baucum has the
ODAC’s best time in the 800 meter
run with a 1:59.9.

in the best 1,500-meters with a time
of 4:09. Covey owns the fastest 400-
meter hurdles, finishing in 57.4.

For the women, seniors Sarah
Bolte and Sandi Dudley lead the way
in the high jump and javelin,
respectively.

The men have not finished lower
than second in the ODAC since 1984.
The women outpointed their ODAC
Opponents last year and will look to
defend their title, which is unofficial
because the ODAC does _ not
track as an

recognize women’s
official sport.
