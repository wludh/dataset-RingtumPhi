WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

AUGUST 30, 1990

omer pleads guilty, gets

six months and probation»

 

By Brian Root and Jason Kelley
of The Ring-tum Phi staff

 

Saying ‘‘I can never make proper
restitution for what I’ve done,’’ for-
mer Washington and Lee student
Charles Blakely Comer pled guilty
yesterday moming to involuntary
manslaughter and hit and run and
was sentenced to six months in jail
for the death of W&L freshman
Mary Ashley Scarborough in March
of 1989.

The guilty plea was part of a sen-
tencing agreement with the com-
monwealth’s attorney. In the agree-
ment, Comer waived his right to a
jury trial as well as his right against
self-incrimination during his trial,
which lasted only an hour Wednes-
day morning.

Judge Rudolph Bumgardner III
accepted the agreement and sen-
tenced Comer to five years in jail,
and, as part of the agreement, sus-
pended all but six months of the
term.

“‘We were relieved that he pled
guilty,’’ said Dr. D.E. Scarborough,
the victim’s father. ‘‘We did not
want to have to go through a trial.’’

Scarborough praised the Lexington
Police Department for its handling
of the investigation and its after-
math.

“‘Lexington is very lucky to have
dlice department like this one,’’
‘borough said.

It’s impossible for me to de-
be what my feelings are,’’ he

. “‘The only thing I can say is
to put yourself in our position, if
can.”’

‘This is a black mark on you,
© associates, and the instituion
*re you attended,’’ Bumgardner

1 Comer after announcing the
tence. ‘‘This tragedy is a low

nt for an institution known for its

lesty and integrity.’’

Bumgardner criticized the univer-

/ for allowing an ‘‘uncontrolled

vironment where such events

ald take place.’’

Commonwealth’s attomey Ray
Robertson said that W&L student
Ann Armentrout testified to the
grand jury that she had seen Comer
that night at a fraternity party.

According to Robertson, Armen-
trout said Comer was intoxicated to
the point that he ‘‘just slid down the
wall and hit his head against the
floor.’’

During the trial, Robertson dis-
closed that after hitting Scarborough
and fleeing the scene, Comer went
back to his house, known as Bear
Farm, and told his three roommates
what had happened.

‘*He went back to Bear Farm and
told his roommates ‘I just hit some-
one and I might have killed her,’’’
said Robertson.

The three roommates Richard
Brock, Greg Hartman and Dodd
Crutcher then told Comer that if he
did not plan to turn himself in, that
he should replace the car’s wind-
shield, which had been damaged in
the accident. Comer drove to
Northern Virginia that night and had
the windshield replaced.

“This tragedy is compounded by
the attempts to cover up the truth,”’
said Bumgardner.

According to Robertson, the three
roommates told Comer that he was
“*in no shape to drive.’’

 

“This tragedy is a
low point for an in-
stitution known for
its honesty and
integrity.”

— Judge Bumgardner

However, Robertson said Comer
claimed he could drive safely, saying
thast the accident had been ‘‘a sober-
ing experience.”

Although Roberson said that all
three roommates could ‘‘easily’’ be
charged with being an accomplice
after the fact, circumstances have
prevented it.

court confession

I, Charles Blakely Comer, do
hereby voluntarily make the fol-
lowing statement.

On March 16, 1989, in the
City of Lexington, Virginia, I had
attended a party at my fraternity
house on Henry Street. I was at
the party for approximately three
hours during which time I con-
sumed beer. I do not know exact-
ly how much beer I had had, but
I acknowledge that I had had
enough beer to impair my ability
to operate a motor vehicle.

I left the party around 2:00
a.m. and was going out Wash-
ington Street. I admit that I had
had too much to drink and was
operating my vehicle recklessly
when I struck Ashley  Scar-
borough, a pedestrian. I knew that
I had struck a pedestrian and that
I should stop. I was afraid,

panicked and did not stop at the
scene of the accident. I deeply
regret my negligent acts and ack-
nowledge that I can never make
proper restitution to the Scar-
borough family or to society.

I am making this statement
voluntarily because I want to tell
the truth in order to help me con-
front the guilt and remorse that |
feel. I want to publicly ac-
knowledge my responsibility and
express my regret and sympathy
for the Scarborough family.

I accept the shame that I feel
and the responsibility for the pain
I have caused the Scarborough
family and my family as a part of
my punishment.

— C. Blake Comer
August 28, 1990

 

 

According to Robertson, one of
the three was given immunity from
prosecution in exchange for his testi-
mony, and the others are citizens of
Texas. Because most states do not
extradite persons charged only with
misdemeanors, the state would not be
able to get them to Lexington for
trial.

Scarborough was killed at the
intersection of Washington and Estill
Streets at about 2:10 a.m.

Robertson also introduced the
results of the autopsy performed on
Scarborough, which determined that
she had died of a fractured skull, and
had been pronounced dead at the
scene of the accident.

The last piece of evidence intro-
duced by the prosecution was a pre-
pared statement, which Comer read,
admitting his involvement.

‘I accept the shame that I feel
and the responsibility for the pain
that I have caused the Scarborough
family and my family as part of my

punishment,’’ said Comer in the
prepared statement.

Following the sentencing, Comer
gave another, more emotional state-
ment.

“*T apologize to the court, to Lex-
ington and to the Scarborough family
for what I’ve done,’’ said Comer in
a halting voice. ‘‘I wish I could bring
back Ashley, but I can’t. I pray for
her and the Scarboroughs.”’

Robertson also disclosed that there
was a woman, also a W&L student,
in the car at the time of the accident.
However, according to Lexington
Police Chief Bruce Beard, she will
not be prosecuted because ‘‘there is
no evidence that shows she had any
knowledge of the accident.’’

Despite a lengthy investigation, the
Lexington police uncovered no sub-
stantial leads until Lexington police
officer Jerry Knick received an anon-
ymous phone call on Nov. 29 nam-
ing Comer as the driver of the car
that killed Scarborough.

Robertson said the anonymous
caller heard of the accident from one
of Comer’s roommates.

Knick traveled to Greenville,
South Carolina, Comer’s hometow::
and found the car, a blue Hons
Accord on Nov. 30. That same day,
Comer confessed to Beard after being
taken into custody on campus.

The trial, originally scheduled for
June 24, but was postponed when the
original prosecutor, Eric Sisler re-
cused himself from the case.

The Scarborough family objected
to Sisler’s previous work for the
university as well as his membership
in Phi Delta Theta, Comer’s fraterni-
ty, while a W&L student.

“I’m glad to see that you’ve taken
the first steps toward taking responsi-
bility for your actions,’’ Bumgardner
told Comer. ‘‘Perhaps the one good
thing to come out of this is that
students will reevaluate their own
standards and rededicate themselves
to honesty and integrity.”’

Swift, emotional trial closes case

 

“tf By Jason Kelley and Brian Root

of The Ring-tum Phi staff

the judge.

‘‘What do you plead to the first of these

charges?”’

 

“Guilty.”

Others in the room quietly chatted or left to get a

drink of water.

When the judge had reentered and the spec-

ector of Communications Beian ,

 

 

In one hour and fifteen minutes, 17 months of
questions were answered and a new chapter in the
lives of two families began.

When Dr. Scarborough entered the courtroom
alone, the Comer family was already seated in the
front row. There wasn’t any contact between the
two sides, but Mrs. Comer leaned a few times over
her husband’s shoulder to look over at Dr. Scar-

| borough. She never caught his eye.

Blake was escorted into the room by two
county jail officers and silently sat down at the
defense table with his lawyer, Thomas Spencer.
He and his lawyer talked quietly until the bailiff
called the court to order.

Judge Bumgardner entered and the clerk read
the formal charges against Blake. ‘‘Involuntary
manslaughter,’’ and, ‘‘felony hit and run,’’ were
the words that stood out.

The agreement between the prosecution and the

' defense was read by the clerk: five years, mostly

suspended, six months jail time.
Blake was then barraged with questions from

‘‘What is your plea to the second of these
charges?”’

“‘Guilty.”’

‘‘Do you understand what these charges mean
and what their penalties are?’’

“70, i.

‘‘Do you understand that in pleading guilty that
you waive your right to a jury trial?’’

“Yes, your honor.’’

The questions went on and on.

It was then the Commonwealth’s turn to present
the evidence. The people presented the autopsy
report: fractured skull, dead at the scene. The
people presented an accident reconstruction report:
tire tracks, blood stains. The Commonwealth’s
attorney read testimony of people)who had seen
Blake and Ashley before the accident.

When the people had nothing further, Blake read
his statement, and the judge then retired to his
chambers to consider the evidence and the agree-
ment.

Blake sat alone, silently at his table and waited.

tators were again seated, Blake and his attorney
remained standing. The judge asked if there was
anything more from the prosecution. No. From the
defense? Blake asked the judge for a few moments
to speak to the court, but the judge asked him to
wait a moment.

“Your plea of guilty will be accepted,’ the
judge said.

Blake was then allowed to speak.

He said many things but his voice faltered and
his mother cried as he said, ‘‘I can not bring
Ashley back, I wish I could. I pray for her and
for the Scarboroughs.’’

When it was all over a few family and school
friends came up to hug Blake or pat him on the
back. His parents did not and, he was handcuffed
and escorted out of the courtroom before they
spoke to him.

Mr. Scarborough left to speak with the press.
The Comers soon followed, but stopped to speak
with no one. And, as it was an hour and fifteen
minutes earlier, the courtroom was empty and
silent. .
