A Washington and Lee student
whose car was taken by an alumnus
over the weekend has chosen not to
press charges.

Junior Jeff Moore appeared in
district court Tuesday morning and
declined to prosecute James G. Chan-
tilas, ‘87, charged with unauthorized
use of a vehicle. sags

Moore said
he parked the “"™
car, a 1988 Moore

Chrysler LeBaron convertible, in the
Beta lot in Red Square at about 7:30
p.m. He said he left the keys in the
dash console and the top down.

When Moore retumed to the lot
an hour later, the car was missing.
He said he waited until 9 p.m., in
case a friend had borrowed the car.
He then called friends to see if they
had the car and searched in other
places for it.

At 10 p.m., when the car had not
been returned, Moore called the po-
lice and reported the car stolen.
Moore said the police issued a state-
wide all points bulletin on the car.

Gary B. Coleman said he spotted

For Dennis G. Manning, the newly ap-
pointed dean of freshmen and residence life,
Washington and Lee is the place to be.

Manning, associate headmaster of the Wood-
berry Forest School, will replace Kenneth P.
Ruscio as assistant dean of students in July.

Manning, who was in Lexingfon this week,
said the W&L position is the next and best step
for him.

‘Working at Washington and Lee and living
in Lexington just strikes me as an extraordinary
opportunity for me and my family,’ Manning
said.

an dean gets first taste of Lexington

‘Every time I've been here I get more and
more enthusiastic and excited about the dean of
freshmen position,’’ Manning said.

Manning received bachelor’s and master’s
degrees in English from Wake Forest in 1981
and 1983. He also worked as a graduate
assistant to the Wake Forest basketball program.

He took his first step into the field of
education when he accepted the position of
administrative assistant to the president of Wake
Forest for the 1982-83 school year.

Manning’s next move was to discover what.
he did not want to do with his life. He there-
fore spent a year studying for the MBA at
Wake Forest.

“‘T think it was the best investment of my
life,’’ Manning said. ‘‘For about $15,000 and

a year of my life, I found out exactly what |
didn’t want to do for the rest of my life.’’

Returning to the academic world, Manning
took a position at Woodberry Forest as an
English teacher, dormitory master, student
advisor, and basketball and tennis coach in the
summer of 1984,

A few years later, Manning won a fellow-
ship to study for his doctorate in English at
Rice University. But before he could leave, he
was pulled back to Woodberry Forest.

‘‘T was leaving Woodberry to go to Rice
when in February or March I got a note from
the headmaster and he appointed me to the
position of assistant headmaster for internal
affairs and student life,’’ Manning said.

‘‘T was responsible for every facet of the

residential life program for 360 students — and
at the same time was still coaching basketball,
teaching English, and serving as an advisor,”’
Manning said.

Manning soon appointed associate headmas-
ter, director of summer school, and director of
col ege counseling. These jobs especially pre-
par+d him for the job of dean of freshmen.

| ‘I've been at a secondary school where the
whole purpose of the four years is preparing’
students for a university experience, he said.

Manning said he will not teach during his
first years as assistant dean.

‘‘My first year or two here, I just want an
absolute, undivided focus upon my responsibili-
ties,’’ Manning said. Then ‘‘I’d love to teach
a composition class or a course in poetry.’’

 

driven south on Main Street and
intercepted it at the intersection of
Jefferson and Henry streets.

According to Coleman, the car
was being driven by Chantilas and
there were two other occupants in the
car. He said Chantilas admitted taking
the car and was arrested.

Moore, who talked to the other
occupants of the car on Saturday and
to Chantilas on Monday, said the
incident was ‘‘all a big misunder-
standing.”’

Moore said the alumni told him
that when they wanted to go get
some dinner their car was blocked, so
they took Moore’s. Moore said the
alumni went to Super 8 Motel, where
they were staying, to eat and fell
asleep.

Moore said the alumni were re-
turning the car to Beta when they
were stopped.

Coleman was not pleased Tuesday
when Moore dropped the charges
against Chantilas.

‘It does not set with a good taste
in my mouth,’’ Coleman said.

Coleman said that when he called
Moore Saturday night and told him
the car had been found, Moore said
he wanted to press charges.

Moore said police told him when
he reported the car stolen Saturday
that he should promise to press
charges against whoever took the car
or police would not look for it as
hard.

Moore contends that after he

found out on Saturday night that it
was an alumnus that took the car,
Coleman told him that Moore would
“‘have to talk to a judge about drop-
ping the charges.”’

The Panhellenic Council decided
not to fund the Contact Committee
after Executive Committee President-
elect Giles Perkins asked PHC Presi-
dent Dale Wyatt if the women’s
Greek organization would contribute.

**It would make a bad situation
worse for Panhellenic to start funding

Contact,’’ said Associate Dean of
Students Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins
Tuesday.

The  Interfraternity Council
withdrew their annual $10,000
support of the guest speaker
committee on April 30, leaving

Contact with only two-thirds of its
$30,000 budget.

IFC President Greg Hicks said the
men’s complaints stemmed from a
lack of fraternity representation on
the committee’s selection board. He
also felt it was unfair for Greek men
to be paying more than other students
to support guest speakers from which
everyone will benefit equally.

‘The fraternities already fund the
university’s social life,’’ Hicks said
last week, ‘‘but at least in that case
they have a say in where their money
is going.”

Atkins agreed that the fraternities
carry a disproportionate amount
financial burden

**It seems crazy for all students to
pay for SAB activities and then
fraternity men or women turn around
and pay twice,’’ Atkins said

Atkins said SAB and Contact
funding are weaknesses of the student
government at W&L and should be
addressed. The Student Activities
Fund should cover it all, Atkins said,

another

PHC funding of Contact would only
lead to the same problems that IFC
funding caused

secured bond.

A preliminary hearing is set for May 21 in
Lexington General District Court, where Elliott
faces up to five years in jail, more if found
guilty of malicious intent.

not mean to litter.

OPINION

Benchwarmers

It must have been an interesting sight for an alumnus
to step into the University Center this weekend and find
the benches in front of the GHQ overflowing with
publications.

For many years the Phi was the only general interest
publication on the W&L campus. This year, there were
no less than three W&L student publications (a fourth
didn’t make it to print for the weekend), and a national
publication with a W&L student editor. What do we think
of the competition? We love it.

After the demise of the Southern Collegian in the late
1960s, the Phi alone bore the heavy burden of providing
news, commentary, and opinion to the student body as a
whole. With the appearance of The Washington and Lee
Spectator two years ago, a new era of student
involvement arrived. Paul Lagarde and Ray Welder’s
Spectator, providing its own distinct brand of com-
mentary and reporting, was such a success that other
groups decided they, too, could publish magazines.

Common Ground, a journal of Christian news and
opinion, published its first issue in March. Close on
Common Ground’s heels, The Traveller galloped onto the
scene just last month, providing yet another forum for
student opinion and reporting. Earlier this year, Paul
Lagarde became an editor of the nationwide Campus
student magazine.

There are also numerous special-interest publications
(many of which have been active for a number of years)
produced by W&L students, including: Ariel, Una Vox,
The Outer Circle, The Star, Theatre at Washington and
Lee, Political Science Review, and the Journal of Science.

We believe the sheer number of publications found on
campus disproves the oft-stated opinion that the W&L
student body has suffered an intellectual death. We have
published numerous letters on this page from alumni,

professors, and administrators who complain that all
students at this school are interested in is partying and
landing high-paying jobs after graduation. We invite these
Nay-sayers to survey the writings on the bench and still
say that our campus is intellectually dead.

We are encouraged Not just the sheer proliferation of
journals, but also the wide range of their political For a
school stereotyped as of a solitary, universal and
conservative opinion, there are plenty of forums for

individual expression. There is na. longer. any excuse for .

you, the W&L student, to not share your point of view
with your peers. Go by the University Center, and you
will surely find a publication to your liking. We look
forward to hearing from you, both on our own pages and
on those of our new-found colleagues.

Law ban raises larger issue.
Gay alum speaks out against discrimination

 

MY VIEW
By Ed Joy

I was very pleased to see the law school’s ban
on employers who discriminate on the basis of
sexual orientation debated in Thz Ring-tum Phi.
The tone of the debate, however, was quite dis-
couraging. I would like to take this opportunity to
do something I was not prepared to do during my
days as a student at Washington and Lee. I would
like to speak up for the rights of gay people. In
fact, I feel I have an obligation to do so, since I
am gay.

The time has come for the university and the
student body to recognize that discrimination
against gays is wrong and to impose sanctions
against those who engage in such discrimination.
Of course, I realize that many at W&L would
disagree. The school has a proud conservative
tradition, but equality for gays is not a matter of
the political right vs. left, but rather right vs.
wrong. The prevailing anti-gay attitudes at W&L
_ Sh a See Eee eRe

. cannot be changed without debate, so I ask, at the

very least, that this editorial be read thoughtfully
and thoroughly. You are part of a great university
and one of the fundamental objectives of any great
university is the pursuit of truth through higher
education. Truth is not achieved through mere
acceptance of the status quo, but through question-
ing and examining the foundation of your values
and beliefs.

The need for change is great. As much as
‘‘fag’’ jokes serve to belittle the discrimination and
dehumanize gays and lesbians, the fact remains that
discrimination has real and harmful consequences.

Art chair
supports prof

Dear Editor,

Since the Spectator comes out less frequently
than the Phi, I follow the time-honored tradition
of using your paper as the vehicle for expressing
my dismay over their recent attack on my col-
league, Valerie Hedquist. All she did was to
write to two local businessmen who are known
to have socially conscious views and to ask if
they knew the content of the magazine they were
advertising in. She enclosed a copy of the Spec-
tator so they could judge for themselves if they
shared her view that the magazine carried racist,
sexist and offensively conservative material. She
did not attempt to start a campaign to undermine
the advertising revenue of the magazine. She did
not even threaten to boycott their businesses. She
simply asked them to read the magazine and
come to their own conclusions. For this she had
her classroom invaded by three angry editors of
the Spectator, who, when she asked them to
come back during her office hours, returned with
hostile accusations. Their confrontation with her,
and their subsequent conversation with me, were
not done in a spirit of civility and tolerance.

The great irony in reading the scurrilous
attack on Professor Hedquist in the latest issue of
the Spectator is that they accuse HER of in-
civility! I have never read anything so full of
misinformation, innuendo and hate-filled prose.
Valerie Hedquist is a superb art historian, an
excellent teacher, and a wonderful person. We
are very fortunate to have her at Washington and
Lee. She has the respect, admiration and full
support of all of her colleagues in this depart-
ment.

 

A recent study by the Department of Health
showed that the suicide rate among gay teenagers
is three times higher than their non-gay counter-
parts. Twenty-five percent of all gay men are
physically assaulted during their lifetime because of
their sexual orientation. An estimated 40-50 percent
of all homeless runaway teenagers are gay. Over
100,000 people have died from AIDS, including
one of Washington and Lee’s very own professors.
Yet, only $1 billion has been spent in search of a
cure since the discovery of the disease a decade
ago (the equivalent was spent each day to pay for
the Gulf War). Apathy prevails because AIDS is
largely viewed as a gay disease and gay lives
somehow do not matter as much. It is no wonder
that The Wall Street Journal referred to gay peo-
ple as America’s last true minority...

Discriminating against:someone on the basis of
his sexual orientation is bigotry pure 4nd simple.
People do not choose to be gay any more than
they choose to be black or hispanic. Prevailing
scientific knowledge indicates that one’s sexual
orientation is set by three years of age. If you do
not believe this and still think people choose to be
gay, then imagine for a moment that you were gay.
Look again at what I detailed above and observe
the many problems you would face. Now, listen to
your families, friends and the world around you.
Do you still think that you would choose to be gay
if there were a choice to be made?

Given that being gay is a characteristic of
mankind, it would seem wrong to think that there
is a right to be gay. It is more appropriate to say
that gays have rights, human rights. Yet, our
society does not extend fundamental rights to gays
and lesbians.

People justify discrimination against gays by
referring to the Bible and traditional moral values.
In the past, passages from the Bible were used to
justify segregation of blacks and subordination of
women. Past generations committed these wrongs
without even recognizing them. Now, our current
society does the same with respect to gay people.
The Bible does not advocate anti-gay bigotry,
rather it is more accurate to say that human beings
read their own prejudices and biases into the Bible.

LETTERS

When I last spoke to Cameron Humphries
(the Editor of the Spectator), I reiterated my
offer to get a group of people together for a
discussion of what we find objectionable in his
magazine. If he and his friends really think it
would be hard for anyone to point out examples
of racism and sexism in the Spectator, then I
would be delighted to give it a try.

 

Thank you,
Pamela H. Simpson, Chair

Alum criticizes
Phi cartoon

Dear Editors:

Some things never change. Leave it to The
Ring-tum Phi to include, in the Alumni Reunion
issue, a cartoon which implies continued denigra-
tion of women at this University. Many of us
who graduated years ago did NOT think women
were the sort of ‘‘sex symbols’’ implied by the
recent cartoon. We saw, especially in graduate
school, that their contributions to academic
institutions were every bit as worthwhile as ours.
Men are not here to parade around looking
attractive, and to portray women in this way
convinces me that you have not yet made this
the kind of University which welcomes women.

On another issue, might | also point out that
your editorial on sexual harassment misses a
major point. Stealing is an honor violation and
a criminal act; but we do not routinely tum in
thieves to the police. Would you prefer a system
in which these violations ARE handled by the
community? I think not. By the same logic, no

Tom Wolfe, best-selling author and Washington

Law School commencement Sunday.

The ceremony, to begin at 2:30 p.m. on the Lee
House lawn, will award 110 juris doctor degrees to
students in W&L’s 136th graduating law class.

According to Dean of the Law School Randall
P. Bezanson, Wolfe, 51, was the overwhelming
favorite speaker among third-year law students for

the May 19 ceremony.

In the event of rain, the ceremony will be

Bezanson said that despite the fact that Wolfe
is not a lawyer, the author should do a good job.

‘‘He is a wonderful speaker,’’ Bezanson said,
‘and he has a great deal to say, not only about the
legal system, but also about social issues that are
relevant to law and lawyers.”’

Wolfe is the author of such books as Bonfire of
the Vanities, The Right Stuff, and The Painted
Word. He has also had published a collection of

Although the drive will not begin

said RARA encourages students to
donate now.

RARA and its affiliate, Helpline
know that the end of the school year
approaches, and they hope that after
spring cleaning, students will decide
to donate. They encourage students to
give canned goods too.

RARA started over 10 years ago
in a volunteer’s kitchen and reached
a small number of people to alleviate
their financial problems. The organi-
zation grew bigger and is now able
to help many more of the needy in
Lexington, Buena Vista and Rock-

Lenfest’s Evita
starts Wednesday

Musical dramatizes life of Eva Peron;
show uses slides of real personalities

 

By Jennifer Gibson
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee’s theatre and
music departments will present Evita
May 22-25 as part of the official
opening of the Lenfest Center for the
Performing Arts.

The documentary-style production
follows the major events of Eva
Peron’s life through two acts.

Beginning as an illegitimate child
from the small village of Junin, Ar-
gentina, Eva rises to become a pow-
erful and controversial 20th-century
figure.

The play depicts Eva’s sordid
background as she leaves her home-
town and travels to Buenos Aires
with a popular Tango singer, Augus-
tin Magaldi. While in the capital, Eva
Duarte meets Juan Peron, a presiden-
tial candidate.

In Act Two, Eva, now the coun-
try’s first lady, is received more
enthusiastically by the people than the
new president. She basks in the glory
of her wealth and popularity.

bills, those in need of food, and
people just passing through town
without a place to stay are but a few
of those that RARA helps.

Once a person calls Helpline,
RARA will aid them in any way
possible, sometimes by giving meal
vouchers, canned goods, and even by
paying bills.

RARA refers donators and people
in need of relief to other organiza-
tions such as local churches, in order
to coordinate funds and relief for the
poor.

‘‘We’re kind of a clearing house
for other charitable groups,’’ a volun-
teer said.

The Helpline suggested several
places which are nearby W&L to
leave furniture, clothing, food and
even kitchen utensils. The food
houses include:

But eventually Eva’s health begins
to decline, and fier husband’s power
over the military weakens. In the
end, the dying Eva wants only to be
remembered as a loved and honored
countrywoman.

Although the basic plot is the
same, this show also differs from
other productions of Evita, agreed
cast members.

Because the stage directions are
vague, much is left to individual
interpretation, actress Jennifer Glad-
well said.

**J.D. Martinez, the director, has
added some nuances,’’ actor Robby
Aliff, who plays Che, said. ‘‘He is
trying to make it a clean production
centered on the show itself without a
lot of set changes or props.”’

This ‘‘docu-musical’’ will also
eature intermittent slide projections
above the stage showing real photos
of the actual Eva and Juan Peron.

Overall, cast members agreed that
it’s been a lot of hard work.

‘‘Everyone is dedicated to making
it the best show it can possibly be,”’
Aliff said.

The Washington and Lee men’s
tennis team, ranked 12th in the na-
tion, upset Emory University to ad-
vance to the quarterfinals of the
NCAA Division III tournament before
losing three times and finishing
eighth in the nation.

Sunday, getting wins from freshman
Rob MacNaughton at No. 2, 6-4, 7-
6 (7-5) over Todd Kennedy, and
senior Reid Manley at No. 4, 3-6, 6-
1, 7-5 over Jim Burs. Manley’s was
the last singles match to finish.

In the doubles, W&L’s No. 3
team of freshman Robert Wein and
sophomore Travis West were down a
set and 4-1 in the second before
rallying for a 6-7 (7-2), 6-4, 6-1 win
over Bums and Adam Brewer. The
No. 2 team of Manley and junior
Richard Yates topped Rick Grossman
and Colin White in straight sets, 6-

bles, W&L’s team of MacNaughton

O’Connell and Kennedy are the na-
tion’s sixth-best doubles team.

Emory had defeated W&L 7-2
during the season.

On Monday, W&L couldn’t ex-
' tend its upset string. The Generals
fell to fourth-ranked Swarthmore 8-

‘ singles, where Meadows blitzed Steve
' Tignor 6-4, 6-2. Meadows is the
nation’s 15th-ranked singles player.

W&LIFE

The Ring-tum Phi, May 16, 1991

 

Graduating law students look back

 

By Karen Lee
Special to The Ring-tum Phi

Three years is a considerable
amount of time to devote to any
activity, let alone one that forces a
person to forego any semblance of
normal, independent life. In fact,
voluntarily submitting one’s self to
three intense years of non-stop study-
ing, exams and papers could be view-
ed as nothing short of ludicrous.

While I review my time at Wa-
shington and Lee in terms of six
semesters, 87 weeks of class, three
mcct court competitions and indeter-
minate hours of studying, my friends
in the real world can’t believe it has
been three years already. But, I am
finally graduating; my three years of
fervor are over.

The best part of attending W&L
Law was the sense of unity and
belonging I felt as part of the law
school community. I enjoyed _per-
sonally knowing every member of my
class, sharing the joys and sorrows of
life and law school with fellow stu-

dents and discovering professors who
were genuinely interested in us as
unique individuals rather than just
another batch of bluebooks to grade.

I also appreciated the fact that
W&L Law School is not limited to
graduating a particular type of lawyer,
such as conservative, money-oriented,
or partnership-bound.

I have learned that having a law
degree is not a ticket to success;
success depends on the ticketholder.
What one ultimately does with a law
degree depends upon the personal
convictions and professional goals of
each person.

This encouragement of individual
diversity, along with the personal
attention students receive from the
faculty and staff, is what makes
W&L Law a special experience.

I hope to covey these qualities to
prospective students as a recruiter for
the law school next fall, after which
I plan to put my law deg-ee to use
by returning to Texas and practicing
in the area of elder law and esiate
planning.

has been anything but typical.

Nothing could have adequately
prepared me for the stress of the first
year of law school. On top of the
difficulty of the work, my wife was
living in a different city first semester
finishing up her masters degree.

How one reacts to the tremendous
stresses of law school is quite in-
dividualistic. I, for one, gained thirty
pounds in my first semester alone.
Some of my classmates started smok-
ing, some turned to drugs or exces-
sive drinking and a few managed to
keep their heads when all about them
were losing theirs, to paraphrase
Kipling.

Unlike Professor Kingfield in
‘The Paper Chase’’ (the movie is on
permanent reserve at the Law Library
for those of you who haven’t see it),
most of my first year professors
didn’t seek to intimidate and humil-
iate us. For the most part, they were
an engaging, enlightening bunch who
made what was of times boring

Grant with his wife, Terry, and

and tedious work reasonably refresh-
ing and meaningful. I will leave the
law school with fond memories of
them.

I ended my first year of law
school with a flourish. My first son
was born to my wife Terry and me
one week before final exams. While
this certainly wasn’t ideal timing, it
was preferable to his being born in
the middle of finals, as was Dave
Clark’s son during our second year.

The work load increased tremen-
dously second year, but at least some
of the anxiety about surviving law
school had lifted. Straight academics
were supplemented with moot court
competitions, mock trials, and extra-
curricular activities.

The things that stand out from my
third year are the birth of my second
son in February, competing with the
National Mock Trial Team at the
Regional Competition in Richmond,
Va. and serving as president of the
Black Law Students Association.

The BLSA this year especially
wanted to convey how race still plays
a significant role in the criminal
Justice system in this country. It was
only several years ago, for example,
that the Supreme Court struck down
the practice of excluding blacks from
the jury merely because the defendant

is also black.

1 leave school with many fond
memories of my classmates, the law
professors and the administration.
