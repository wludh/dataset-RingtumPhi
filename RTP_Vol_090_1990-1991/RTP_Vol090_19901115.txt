WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

Renaissance
costs soar

million

Inflation partly blamed for
$3 million increase in costs

 

By Pamela Kelley
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee’s Fraternity
Renovation program will cost $3 mil-
lion more than originally projected.

W&L Treasurer Lawrence Broom-
all said inflation and new items in-
corporated into the program led the
university to increase its initial $10
million estimation to $13 million.

Broomall said the university as a
whole is not ‘‘in the red,’’ but mon-
ey will be tight for the next year.
According to Broomall, the univer-
sity has already financed the projec-
tions for renovations by restructuring
its budget, drawing from two main fi-
nancial pools: two bequests to the
university’s endowment totalling over

Every fraternity must
take some shred of
responsibility for the
whole [of the Renais-
sance].

— John Wilson

$6 million designated for renovations
by the Board of Trustees, and almost
$6 million originally set aside for
improvements to existing university
structures and equipment now trans-
ferred to renovations.

The improvements will instead be
financed by a loan, Broomall said. A
loan was taken out for the campus
improvements rather than the fraterni-
ty renaissance because of complica-
tions with federal regulations. Broom-
all said the university hopes to recov-
er half of renaissance costs through
lease fees for renovated houses, room
rent and the newly imposed Greek
member fee. W&L President John D.
Wilson hopes the remainder of the
costs will be financed by a ‘‘capitol
campaign’ targeting alumni.

Police
probe SPE,
Fiji incident

By Kimberly Boots
Staff Reporter

 

 

 

 

Authorities continue to investigate
the incidents between members of
Sigma Phi Epsilon and Phi Gamma
Delta during the early hours of Nov.
3, including a shot-out window on
the first floor of the SPE house.

After an evening of conflict be-
tween the two fraternities, Peer A.
Soderberg, the vice-president of SPE,
allegedly fired a shotgun into the
ceiling and walls of the SPE house.
Apparently at some point during that
morning, a bullet was also fired into
the SPE house, breaking a window
and piercing the opposite wall in a
room that was locked and unoccupied
all night. SPE president John Flippen
said the broken window was discov-
ered the following morning.

Lexington Police Chief Bruce
Beard said the window is located on
the west side of the SPE house,
facing the Fiji house. Beard said the
path of the projectile showed that it
came from the direction of the Fiji
house but that police ‘‘haven’t con-
firmed that the Fijis were responsible
for it.’

Charles ‘‘Murph’’ Murray, head
of W&L security, said he and the
police searched for the bullet, but
could not recover it. Use of a metal
detector failed to indicate the pres-
ence of a bullet in the wall.

Members of both fraternities are
being questioned, Beard said. ‘‘We’re
just waiting for somebody to say
something, make a slip and say som-
ething,’’ Murray said.

Soderburg was charged with
maliciously discharging a firearm, a
felony. His trial date is set for Jan.
15, 1991.

Meanwhile, Broomall told soror-
ity members in an annual Panhel-
lenic Membership meeting Tuesday
evening they would not be charged
the university's Greek Member Fee
until September. Citing ‘‘poor com-
munication’ as the primary reason
for the delay, Broomall told Greek
women that Wilson decided to post-
pone collecting the fee after the met

with W&L sorority leaders Friday.

Associate Dean of Students Leroy
‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins said he hopes that
although sorority members will not be
required to pay this year, they will
voluntarily pay the fee to build equity
in order to match that represented by
the fraternity houses.

Although Greek women will not
be required to pay the fee until next
year, every fraternity is still required
to pay. ‘‘Every fraternity must take
some shred of responsibility for the
whole,’’ Wilson said including the
Chi Psi fraternity. Chi Psi is the only
fraternity financing renovations on
its own and refusing to pay the fee.

Broomall met with Chi Psi mem-
bers and parents two weeks ago.

Most Chi Psi parents said they
would support their sons if they
continued to refuse to pay the fee,
saying that the fraternity would gain
little by complying with it. Wilson
said he hopes to. meet. with. Chi Psi’s
House Corporation Chairman Andy
Dewing and Alumni Advisor George
Ray to discuss a compromise.

In response to concerns raised by
sorority members that they are being
charged the fee without representation
on several university committées,
Howison said he feels sororities will
eventually have a representative on
the SAC and in the meanwhile the
Panhellenic president will sit on the
committee as a non-voting member.
Also, President Wilson has offered
the PHC president a position on the
Fraternity Renaissance Committee.

Meredith blasts affimative action

 

By Gregory Patterson
Staff Reporter

 

The first black man to attend the
University of Mississippi told a Lee Chapel
audience last Wednesday night that affir-
mative action must be abolished in order
for blacks to succeed.

James Meredith, who enrolled at Mis-
sissippi in 1962 and who is the only black
person on the staff of Republican North
Carolina Senator Jesse Helms, spoke on
‘*Education and the Racial Question.’

He told the crowd that affirmative ac-
tion was a curse to competitive blacks, who
were then seen as ‘‘tainted because no
matter what the reason...they were in the
school or what their qualifications were,
they were suspect because of some special
program and that is a horrible thing.”’

Meredith went on to say the family has
been pushed out of the education process
as a result of the ‘‘takeover of the
educational machinery by the union move-
ments...I just don’t think a union can run a
school.”’

‘The only way that a large number of
black males between the ages of 10 and 16
can be taught is with the disciplinary as-
sistance of middle-aged black women. This

category of the black race has been pushed
out of the education system leading to the
situation we have today.”’

One of the first questions from the
audience asked why Meredith criticized the
federal government’s role in education
when it was the government that allowed
him to attend the University of Mississippi.
Meredith said it was not the government
that gave them the right to attend the
university, it was his citizenship.

Finally, Meredith was asked about his
ties to Sen. Helms, who has been accused
of using racist tactics in his most recent
campaign. _

Meredith said that Helms has consistent-
ly supported legislation to rebuild the
American family, which Meredith said is
an important step in making blacks suc-
cessful.

‘*For 27 years, I have tried to dispel the
image that I was a liberal, that I believed
in civil rights, that I believed in the non-
violence thing, but to no avail. But I
reasoned that if I became associated with
Sen. Jesse Helms, everybody would
immediately know that I was not a liberal.’’

Meredith also said that in the year he
has worked for Helms, he has not
encountered racism of any kind in the
organization.

Arrests
made for
burglaries

By Ashley Harper
Staff Reporter

 

 

Police have arrested three men in connection with
what Lexington police Chief Bruce M. Beard called an 8-
day ‘‘crime spree,’’ which affected both Washington and
Lee students and local residents.

‘‘We had quite a little crime spree going on here,"’
said Beard.

According to police, those arrested are responsible for
the thefts from the Sigma Phi Epsilon, Kappa Sigma and
Pi Kappa Phi fraternity houses, as well as from a law
student’s residence,

Lexington Police Officer Gary B. Coleman conducted
the investigations and recovered $13,000 in merchandise.
Some investigations are still in process, and more items
are expected to be recovered, Coleman said.

“‘November 10, it was brought to my attention about
who could possibly be responsible for the burglaries,’’
Coleman said.

Saturday the Chesterfield County Police Department
arrested Staunton resident Floyd E. Richardson in the J.C.
Penny’s store at the Cloverleaf Mall for forgery and for
using the stolen credit card belonging to W&L student
Chris O’Brien, Coleman said.

‘An informant gave me the location of the car,’’ said
Coleman. ‘‘There is no honor among thieves, so once we
’ arrested one, he gave information for favors.’’

One suspect is still at large, and three others including
a juvenile have been apprehended. Richardson, 19, was
arrested for breaking and entering and grand larceny.

‘William T. Carter III, 28, was the wheel man in
charge of the thefts,’’ said Coleman.

“I'd like to commend Officer Coleman on a fine job
in solving this crime wave,’’ said Beard. ‘‘He’s put a lot
of hours into it and I do appreciate that.’’

The ‘‘crime wave’’ began Oct. 29, when someone
entered the Pi Phi fraternity house. A computer, printer
and wallet were stolen before students woke up and ran
the men off. The printer was recovered, said police.

According to police, a man, armed with a butcher
knief, entered the Kappa Sig house. A student woke up,
saw the man. The student yelled, and startled the man,
who dropped the butcher knife and ran. An amplifier, tape
deck, receiver, a London Fog coat and a sports jacket
were stolen. The coat was recovered, according to
Coleman.

More burglaries occurred the night of Friday Nov. 9.
The first occurred at SPE, where a VCR, stereo receiver,
O’Brien’s car keys and his car were stolen. The car was
recovered, according to police.

That same night W&L law student Mitcl: Neurock’s
house was broken into. A computer and $3,000 of jewelry
were stolen. The computer and $1,500 of jewelry were
recovered, according to police.

‘The number of student robberies were down this

 

year until this crime wave,’’ Beard said.

EC considers amendments

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

 

A proposed change to the student
body constitution that would open
more Executive Committee delibera-
tions to the public was debated along
with other proposed changes at Mon-
day night’s EC meeting.

Constitutional Revisions Commit-
tee representative Walter Scott an-
swered questions from the EC Mon-
day night about five proposals to
amend the student body constitution,
including a clarification of executive
session which drew the most criti-
cism.

The proposal would allow the EC
to hold closed-door, executive ses-
sions only for honor investigations

interviews, disciplinary hearings, and
discipline in honor-related matters as
outlined in White Book Section O.

The measure forbids closed-door
or executive sessions for budget hear-
ings and deliberations, and committee
appointment deliberations.

This year’s EC has followed those
procedures except during committee
appointment deliberations, which have
been closed.

EC President Tom Hatcher,
third-year EC law Rep. Mark Cobb
and junior EC Rep. Caroline Wight
supported closed committee appoint-
ment deliberations so that the EC can
discuss statements by interviewees
intended as confidential.

‘‘We do take personal charac-
teristics into account,’’ said Hatcher,
“such as how people work with

of grade point average being a con-
sideration for some appointments.

EC Vice President Raymond Wel-
der, senior EC Reps. Willard Dumas
and John Fialcowitz, and sophomore
EC Rep. Kirk Ogden all advocated
that appointment proceedings be open,
including the interviews.

The 1990-91 EC last spring voted
to close its committee appointment
deliberations but agreed to post mem-
bers’ voting records.

Scott last spring called that vote
‘“‘against the constitution,’’ which
currently states that the EC may enter
executive session only for honor
matters.

Monday night, Wight did not
oppose a public voting record for
closed deliberations.

Scott said confidential statements

concerned EC members before open-
ing the door for public deliberation.
He added that the necessity for that
would probably be rare.

Other proposed amendments con-
cerned succession of Big Three elect,
special elections to fill vacant offices,
adjustments to allow earlier elections,
and the fiscal role of the Publications
Board as an ‘‘umbrella’’ organization.

The EC instructed Scott to reas-
semble the revisions committee to
consider the EC’s concerns about the
draft proposals and return to the EC
by early January with final proposals.

Constitutional procedure requires
a two-thirds vote of the EC or 50
student signatures to send an amend-
ment to referendum. Two-thirds of
the student body, with at least half
voting, must okay it in order for the

..committee chairman and

trials,

committee appointment  others.’’

Wight added the example

Phase One behind schedule

 

By Courtney Hall
Staff Reporter

At first glance, the construction in Red
Square might bring to mind the aftermath of
a tornado,

Almost everyone doubts that the houses
currently under construction in Phase One of
Washington and Lee’s Fraternity  re-
naissance will be finished by their target
date in two months.

Everyone, that is, except Capital Plan-
ning Coordinator Frank Parsons. Although
Parsons acknowledged he was ‘‘concerned
that the contractor of Red Square will not
have the houses done by the pre-determined
date of mid-December,’’ he said that the
contractor has reassured him that four of the
six houses will be completed.

Parsons said that completed houses,
probably Phi Delta Theta, Pi Kappa Alpha,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Nu, should
be ready for students during W&L’s Christ-

mas break. He said that the two houses
running behind schedule, Beta Theta Pi and
Phi Kappa Sigma, will not be ready for the
transition until February break.

Associate Dean of Students for Greek
Affairs said that the transition into Phi Kapp
might not occur until as late as Spring.

Atkins said the postponements will not
leave fraternity members out in the cold. He
said that they all have one-year leases on
their current residences and will only be
looking to sublet current accommodations,
so it is immaterial if they begin their search
in January or March.

‘We're just trying to work it out in a
nice, orderly way without trying to inconve-
nience everyone else,’’ Atkins said.

According to Parsons, the lags in Phase
One will not disrupt plans for Phase Two
construction to begin on five other houses.

‘Phase Two is minimally affected by
Phase One Red Square houses,’’ Parsons
said, ‘‘Our expectation is to begin [Phase
Two] as soon as possible.’’

Construction on all five Phase Two
houses had been originally slated to begin in
January. Parsons laid out a new, tentative
schedule for Phase Two construction:

* Renovation of the old Zeta Beta Tau
house for Kappa Sigma beginning in early
January.

* Renovation of Lambda Chi beginning
in mid-January.

* Renovation of Pi Kappa Phi and Phi
Kappa Psi beginning later in the winter.

eRenovation of Sigma Chi beginning in
early Spring.

Parsons said that Phase Two is different
from Phase One because the houses are
more widely distributed across campus.
Because of that, he said, Phase Two con-
struction can be staggered. Parsons said
there would be no change in the overall
calendar of the Renaissance.

‘There is no change in the schedule,’’
he said. ‘‘September of 1992 is the date we
expect fraternity houses to be in full compli-
ance.”’

by interviewees could be reiterated by

new rules to go into effect.

REMINDERS

 

— Washington and Lee Security reminds all students
and faculty going out of town for break to please
secure your room/apartments/houses, and keep all
valuables locked up.

According to security, students often leave such
items as bicycles unlocked during breaks, and they are
taken while students are away.

‘*Whenever we find bikes or things like that outside
[during breaks], we put them in our office,’’ said
Thomas Bane. ‘‘But a lot of stuff still gets taken. We
have an honor system here, but people should know it
doesn’t always apply to locals who want to come over
here and steal things.’’

— On a somewhat happier note, the Phi staff wishes
everyone a happy and safe Thanksgiving.

Things to be
thankful for

Students at W&L are often considered to be ingrates. That’s
not true — it’s just that we don’t express that thankfulness
that often. With that in mind, we would like to provide our
readers with a few ideas for what to say they are thankful
for when the family gathers around the big turkey and says
its blessing.

Seniors, be thankful that — you don’t have to live under
that contemptible no-keg rule for more than a few months;
you’re graduating before the demise of the well-rounded
W&L student becomes a reality; and you were admitted to
our school before it became harder to get in here than it is
to avoid the Greek Tax.

Juniors, be thankful that — you still have a year and a
half to play around before you have to get a job; you’ll be
around for Mock Convention next spring; and you probably
didn’t have to live in a fraternity house with a house
mother.

Sophomores, be thankful that — you’re not an aimless
freshman; you’re not a pledge; you don’t have to park in the
freshman parking lot; and people will for the most part
spare you from annoying questions such as Do you like
college and Does your roommate worship the devil.

Freshman, be thankful that — you have (at least) four
Spring Terms and four Fancy Dresses to look forward to;
the school’s academic reputation is getting better and better,
and by the time you graduate it will be through the roof;
coeducation is working superbly and the male/female ratio
is evening out; your hair hasn’t started to fall out yet; and
no one outside of your parents cares what your resume
looks like or what your G.P.A. is.

Most of all, we should all be thankful that we don’t have
to go back to VMI in two weeks.

Lloyd’s lost

It’s the end of an era. Just as Nevada lost one of its
landmark business establishments, the Mustang Ranch,
recently, Lexington has seen the demise of a part of its
tradition and heritage: Lloyd’s is no more.

Despite the image problems our favorite late-night diner
has had recently, the atmosphere was as healthy as the food
was Offensive. Pity the poor incoming freshman for next
year, who will miss the opportunity to test their stomachs
against Lloyd’s hearty fare — words can never illustrate for
them the experiences they will have missed.

Whether Lloyd’s was evicted from its building (or left on
its own volition, depending whom you listen to) the owner’s
plea for student help to bring the restaurant back should be
heeded. Certainly, this is one issue that can bring together
people on campus regardless of their political ideology,
Greek affiliation, grade point average or social preference.
If we cannot unite behind Lloyd’s, then perhaps we are truly
as apathetic as the community around us believes.

W&L, and the city of Lexington as a whole, needs
Lloyd’s, for the area loses a tremendous amount of color
with the collapse of the city’s only 24-hour culinary palace.
Let’s get together, and bring Lloyd’s back. Or perhaps not.

MY VIEW
By Robert Wilson

Isn’t this place great! W&L is

 

such a wonderful school. We live in’

a great environment chock full of
friendly students, awesome professors,
a beautiful campus and great opportu-
nities. I mean, what could be better?
Well guys, a lot could be better. This
wonderful environment in which we
live here is not the real world. This
microcosm of society shelters us from
the trying elements of the real world.
This characteristic of our W&L
world is conducive to apathy. There
are many people outside of our envi-
ronment here who do not have what
we have. There are people who have
no cars, no nice clothes, no educa-
tion, no job and not even a home.
You may not see them, but they are

there. They are on the streets of Lex-
ington. They are in the parking lot at
Walmart. They are living behind your
fraternity houses and next door to
your apartments. have you seen their
faces? Have you heard what they
have to say? iN ‘

What do-you think when you seé
a family of six packed into a run-
down compact station wagon? Have
you looked carefully at the holes in
their coats? Do you care? Do you
wonder where they live and what
they eat? I don’t think any of us
have ever lost sleep due to the hun-
ger pangs from missing dinner. We
are not aware of the pain they experi-
ence in their lives. I think its time
we should become aware.

I know what you're thinking
about now....‘‘He’s just another radi-
cal who’s jumped up on his soap
box, preaching about this and that.
Everybody has a cause, whether its

the poor, the hungry, AIDS, apart-
heid, whatever.’’ I mean really, why
should you pay attention to me?
Haven't I mostly told you things you
already know? Everyone’s seen the
commercials and read the pamphlets.

vverXou) saw, LIVE, AID on national TV,
_ Where . they. told the stories of the

homeless. Well, think about this....

We are all human. We have hu-
man dispositions and we have human
emotions. So do they. They live and
breathe and feel as we do. We have
the same passions and longings. We
want to live. The people of which I
speak are all part of this brotherhood
we call humanity.

Thus, we, as members of this
society, have an obligation to try to
understand the plight of their lives
and help alleviate the pain with
which they live day to day. Percy
Bysshe Shelley, one of the Romantic
poets, once wrote on human sympa-

thy in the preface to his poem
Alastor:

They who, deluded by no generous
error, instigated by no sacred thirst of
doubtful knowledge,...loving nothing
on this earth, and cherishing no hopes,
beyond, yet keep aloof from sympa-

‘thies with their kind, rejoicing neither

in human joy or mourning with hu-
man. grief; these, and such as they,
have their apportioned curse. They:
languish because none feel with them
their common nature. They are moral-
ly dead. They are neither friends, nor‘
lovers, nor fathers, nor citizens of the.
world, nor benefactors of their coun-
try.
We all have probleme in our lives
and we all have pain. But the best
way to beat this pain is to face it;
together. Our lives, need not be lived
alone; we can face it together and’
win. Think about them at your next
meal and do something to help.

Let SCC
decide —
FIJI/SPE facts

After reading the editorial of November 8,
proclaiming an alleged justification for FUJI’s
involvement in a recent conflict with Sigma Phi
Epsilon, I was dismayed by the misleading nature
of Yorio’s comments. As another law student
who attended Sig Ep’s party that night (and the
roommate of the ‘‘unidentified law student’ that
Yorio claims was involved in the ‘‘initial con-
flict,’’) I feel several observations must be made
to clarify the events of that night.

First and foremost, these are allegations.
Webster defines allegations as ‘‘assertions with-
out proof.’’ I would suggest to readers of The
Ring-tum Phi that they consider Webster's in-
sight. The facts of the initial conflict will prove
exactly the opposite of what Yorio would like,
that FIJI’s actions were entirely unjustified and

will result in disciplinary actions against mem-
bers of Phi Gamma Delta. I find it hard to
believe that he can justify the beating adminis-
tered to an outnumbered Soderberg by a pack of
FIIs, some of whom were carrying wooden
‘‘two-by-fours.’" Traditionally, such felonious
behavior has been labelled assault and battery.
Although I originally hesitated to even ad-
dress Yorio’s comments because their motivation
is so transparent, in defense of the truth, I feel
I must point out a few relevant facts. Yorio's
comments were an attempt to justify Phi Gam’s
actions. In fact, what he has succeeded in doing
is to confirm his undeniable lack of credibility
and his refusal to accept responsibility for Phi
Gam’'s actions. Instead of waiting for the SCC
hearings to make his case, FUI’s president has
desperately tried to sway the Washington and Lee
community with skewed facts.
For example, Yorio has subtly suggested that
“the initial conflict involved Sohonage against
three others. This was not the case. The conflict
to which Yorio refers involved two individuals

 

LETTERS

against two other individuals, with the ‘‘unidenti-
fied law student’’ intervening to prevent a fight.
Further, the conflict was not the first of two but
the second of three. The first incident involved
the over 30 FIJI brothers belligerently appearing
on Sig Ep’s steps, ready to fight over a supposed
anti-FIJI insult painted on the wall of Sig Ep's
cave during the Caveman Party. It was this
incident which began the unfortunate events
which occurred later that night. I could offer
further facts contradicting Yorio’s comments, but
there is no need.

The editorial tried to paint a picture of FUI
innocence. What Yorio has done in fact is re-
sorted to a cheap ploy to misinform readers of
The Ring-tum Phi in hope that this will somehow
excuse his fraternity’s actions. Why didn’t Yorio
allow FIJI’s guilt or innocence to be decided at
the SCC meeting? Because he is scared of what
the facts will show. His comments purport to
clarify matters, but they do not. The facts of this
unfortunate incident between Sigma Phi Epsilon
and FIJI will not be decided at the FIJI house,
but at the SCC meeting.

Sincerely,
Greg Garbacz, Law °93

Late-night fire
drills irritate

On the evening of Thursday, November 8, |
thought I might retire early to my luxurious suite
in Gilliam Dormitory. A most heinous cold had
been bothering me throughout the week, and I
was determined to get in some quality rack time
so that I could make it through the week without
coughing up a lung.

So there I was, asleep in bed, visions of road
cheese dancing in my head, when there was a
knock at my door. My roommate answered it,
and the ensuing commotion succeeded in waking
me up fully. It was a dorm counselor who told,
nay commanded, us to get some clothes on
because a fire drill was currently in progress.

After muttering several obscenities under by
breath, I managed to slip on my favorite bathrobe

and a pair of high-top sneakers. I gazed at my
watch on the way out — 12:15 am.! I asked

myself what kind of insensitive boob would call
a fire drill after midnight when we had classes
the next day.

During the next few minutes, I freezed my
doo-dads off in the chilly night air. I wondered
why these fire drills were performed at reason-
able hours when most people are awake.

The next morning, I woke up feeling like my
head was clogged with Lime Jell-O. My mind
failed to convince my body that my 8 o'clock
computer class was a necessary thing. Somehow;
through an unexplained miracle, I managed to
make it to all my other classes.

Of this person who schedules these drills, I
ask two simple things, neither of which is entire-
ly unreasonable:

1. No more late-night fire drills.

2. A public apology to myself and any others
who were awakened by this extremely unortho-
dox maneuver.

Sincerely,
Thomas F. Hespos, Jr.

Apology to
Lloyd's
employee

I want to apologize to Robert Rorrer, the
Lloyd’s employee I interviewed for my article,
‘‘Lloyd’s fights gang image.’’ I quoted him as
describing a group known as the L-Posse as ‘‘a
few local black teenagers with flattop haircuts
who wore L.A. Raiders caps.’’ Another employee,
who wished to remain anonymous, actually told
me this. Rorrer, who was standing nearby at the
time, merely nodded. I sincerely apologize to Mr.
Rorrer. Although I am sorry people were of-
fended by the article, I make no apologies for
the article and fully stand behind what I wrote.

Sincerely,
Chris Swann '92

SAB searches for theme, bands

 

By Tom Eisenhauer
Staff Reporter

 

Preparation for the 84th annual
Fancy Dress Ball accelerated this
week with the selection of a theme,
consideration of several band pos-
sibilities, and selection of the Fancy
Dress Steering Committee.

On Tuesday night, the Steering
Committee and the SAB voted on the
theme of the March 8th Ball. Ac-
cording to SAB President Katie Duw-
el, some ‘'14 or 15 random sugges-
tions’’ were originally considered,
with 6 or 7 surviving last week’s
elimination process.

The choice will not be revealed
until Thursday, February 28, but FD
Chairman John Flippen stated that
they ‘‘are hoping to get back to a
more general theme, one reflecting a

time period or area of the world.”’ It
will be ‘‘large, spectacular, and
simple,’’ he added.

Duwel said that senior David
Blank is currently ‘‘in the process of
booking the bands.’’ She mentioned
the Neville Brothers, Bodeans, Buck-
wheat Zydeco, and Three Dog Night
as examples of bands being con-
sidered. The Black Crowes remain a
slim possibility, but Duwel empha-
sized that ‘‘getting them would take
a lot of negotiation.”’

‘We might also have a surprise,”’
she said, ‘‘[someone] off the beaten
track.’’

The 34-member Steering Com-
mittee, which was announced by the
SAB last Friday, includes the follow-
ing 13 Sub-Committee Chairmen:

No action
yet in Pi
Phi case

No action has been taken by
the administration in the investi-
gation of Pi Kappa Phi for al-
legedly giving drugs to freshmen
during Rush, although Dean of
Students David Howison insists
the investigation is still open.

‘‘There has been no new
information whatsoever, but the
case is still open,’’ said Howison.

Howison said that neither the
Student Activitiés Committee, the,
Student Conduct’ Committee nor
the Confidential Review Commit-
tee has taken any action against
the house or against any of its
members.

When asked why he or one of
the other deans had not pursued
the case, Howison said, ‘‘The
case is still open. I have nothing
further.’’

Howison said when the char-
ges first surfaced, he and Asso-
ciate Dean of Students Ken Rus-
cio turned the matter over to Pi
Phi President Skip Sugarman, who
questioned each member of the
house about whether anyone had
given drugs to freshmen.

Sugarman said that each mem-
ber of his house, on their honor,
had told him that they had neither
given nor offered drugs to any

freshmen.

“T felt that his action was at
the time appropriate and I still
do,’’ Howison said, ‘‘I think Skip
Sugarman acted in a responsible
manner.”’

Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent Goodloe Lewis said the IFC
has not pursued the case.

‘*That was over the third week
of Rush,’’ Lewis said.

Store fears
IFC keg ban

The owner of Kelly’s Corner
said Monday that the proposed
IFC rule to ban kegs at fraternity
parties will damage his business.

“Tt will affect us quite a bit
and hurt our business a great
deal,’’ Miles Nye said.

Nye and his wife Sandy have
owned Kelly’s Comer, a con-
venience store located two and a
half miles west of Lexington, for
seven years. A large part of their
business has been supplying kegs
to Washington and Lee frater-
nities. Kelly’s Comer goes
through 1500 to 1800 kegs a
year, although not all are sold to
fraternities, Nye said.

The IFC keg rule will make
fraternities buy packaged beer, if
they buy beer at all, Nye said.
The only competition Kelly’s
Comer has had to sell kegs is
East Lex, another convenience
store in Lexington. Several gro-
cery stores sell packaged beer, so

NEWS BRIEFS

Kelly’s corner will now have to
compete with them.

‘‘Dealing packaged beer, we’re
forced to compete with others like
Kroger and Harris Teeter,’’ Nye
said.

Because Kelly’s Corner is
located out of town and cannot
afford to sell packaged beer as
cheaply as major grocery stores,
Nye thinks he could lose a great

deal of business.
Nye believes that the IFC rule

will do more harm than good.
Fraternities will buy grain alcohol
and hard liquor instead of paying
more money for packaged beer,
he said.

‘I think it’s very foolish,’’ he
said. ‘‘I think keg beer is the
safest way to consume alcohol. A
keg stays in one place.’”

Howison: Critical Pro is
not as bad as you think

 

By Jason Kelley
Senior Copy Editor

Critical probation is not as bad as
most fraternity members think it is,
according to Dean of Students David
Howison.

Howison told the Interfraternity
Council Tuesday night that critical
probation is the Student Affairs Com-
mittee’s way of telling a fraternity it
is having difficulty.

“It saying let’s work together to
fix the problems because the next
time (a house breaks the rules) it
could be suspended,’’ said Howison.

Associate Dean of Students for

Dorm fire alarms

 

By Chris Bray
Staff Reporter

 

Many Washington and Lee stu-
dents had to do the unexpected last
week — respond to a dormitory fire
alarm.

Last week, residents of the fresh-
man dorms (Thursday night) and
Gaines Hall (Tuesday evening) evacu-
ated the buildings as part of a fire
drill exercise,

According to Dean of Students
David Howison, under a new univer-
sity policy, all residence halls will
have one fire drill per term.

‘‘When I arrived here, I found
there was no systematic response to
the fire alarm system,’’ said Howison.

 

TALKBACK

Greek Affairs Leroy ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins
said under critical probation, minor
infractions of IFC rules would not be
considered grounds for suspension of
a chapter.

“‘T don’t see critical probation as
expecting you to have an incident-
free year,’’ said Atkins.

Howison said fraternity misdoings
are first investigated by the IFC, and
if circumstances warrant, SAC may
also review certain cases,

He said that if fraternity leaders
discipline their own members proper-
ly, SAC would most likely not put a
house on critical probation for an
infraction committed by only a few
members.

“The alarms go off inadvertently and
the students have learned to ignore
them.”’

Howison says the fire drills have
been instituted to help locate prob-
lems in the system as well as remind
students of evacuation procedures.

The fire drill in the freshman
dorms uncovered one fault in the
system. Dean of Residence Life Ken
Ruscio said the Thursday night drill
revealed that the system in Gilliam
was malfunctioning. The alarm did
not sound when pulled by security.

Director of University Tecinical
Services Thomas Tinsley says the
problem was resolved by Friday
afternoon, after campus electricians
located and fixed the glitch in the
system.

for this Thanksgiving?

 

Officer R.D. Clark, #0027, Lexi-
ngton, VA = ‘‘My family.’’

 

“If a leader of a house takes
strong action I would not recommend
critical probation,’’ Howison said.

Atkins said that fraternity leaders
should remind their members that any
action by an individual reflects on the
whole house. He said he has had
reports of some fraternity members
causing problems at some girls
schools in the past few weeks.

‘In some cases, their actions are
subhuman,”’ said Atkins.

‘When you go down to Hollins
or up to Staunton and do these
things, it isn’t just making you look
like a horse’s behind, it makes your
whole house look that way.’

checked

Washington and Lee’s Superinten-
dent of Buildings and Grounds James
Arthur says he was unaware of the
Gilliam mishap. Arthur added that it
is B&G’s policy to check the campus
alarm systems on a semi-anr.:ial basis.

According to Dean Ruscio, the
Dean of Students office is planning
to make a comprehensive assessment
of fire safety procedures in the dor-
mitories,

Ruscio says students will be con-
sulted in the evaluation of fire safety.
He says the evaluation would cover
fire alarm and evacuation procedures,
an understanding of the alarm system,
and policies for misuse of the system.

Ruscio plans on a system assess-
ment for sometime in the near future.

Generals defeat Hoyas in season finale

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

For the Washington and Lee foot-
ball team, the season could not have
ended any better.

The Generals finished the 1990
season with a 21-6 win over Geor-
getown last Saturday to even the
season record at 5-5. The win was
W&L’s fourth in five games after a
1-4 start and sent the seniors out as
winners.

The W&L offense sputtered early,
but the defense kept a high-powered
Georgetown passing attack in check,
intercepting quarterback Craig De-
Gruchy twice, once from freshman
Tom Mandia and once from soph-
omore Donald Dempsey, in a score-
less first half.

“Our offense was sputtering a bit
in the first half,’’ said W&L head
coach Gary Fallon, ‘‘and any time
that happens you really hope the
defense is doing its job, and it was.”’

In the third quarter, the W&L
defense again stood tall. After Geor-
getown had driven into W&L ter-
ritory, DeGruchy dropped back to
pass and was dropped by sophomore
Lyle Smith on a blitz. Mandia broke
up a pass on the next play, forcing a
punt.

The W&L offense took over at its
own 33-yard line, and after two runn-
ing plays netted three yards, junior
quarterback Fred Renneker went to
the air.

He found his man twice — senior
All-American split end Craig Irons
for gains of ten, moving the ball to
the Georgetown 44. Senior tailback
Mason Pope then ran six yards to the
38, setting up the first big play of the
day for the Generals.

On third down from the 38, out

handoff to the short side as everyone
else goes to the wide side. The play
worked to perfection. Kreis took the
handoff and got to the corner. Junior
guard Jim Henry blocked the only
Hoyas who had a chance, and Kreis
sprinted down the W&L sideline 59
yards for the touchdown and a 14-6
lead.

‘They had a free safety blitz
called on the play,’’ said Kreis!
‘‘Both guards pull on the play, and
[senior] Rob Roberton got caught up
in the backfield, but Jim Henry gor
out there and kept the defensive end ~
from getting out there. That was the
block that sprung the play.”

WA&L added a touchdown later, 4
one-yard run by Renneker set up by
a 20-yard punt return by Williamsori
and a diving catch at the three-yard
line by Irons. The defense sealed the
21-6 win with senior safety Brag

Goglia led the W&L ground attack
with 91 yards on 14 carries, both
career highs. Pope finished his career
with 75 yards on 28 carries.

The defense held Georgetown to
just 13 of 38 passing with four inter-
ceptions, two by Mandia. No team
completed S50 percent of its passes
against W&L’s defense.

W&L wrestlers
ready to start

 

,From W&L Sports Information

 

In 1989-90, Washington and Lee
wrestling coach Gary Franke had
‘trouble putting together a complete
foster,

He managed to do so with the
help of nine freshmen.

This year, Franke feels much
‘better about his team, mainly because
_those nine freshmen are sophomores
with a year of experience under their
rbelts.

Franke also has 93 percent of his
‘team scoring back from last year, led
iby his top three wrestlers in pins,
takedowns, reversals, escapes and
‘team scoring.

“It’s a good situation to have
“such a solid group coming back,”’
; Franke said. ‘‘We have some young
talent that really improved over the
‘course of last year. Now, it will be
, interesting to see how they come
along this year.’’

What makes Franke even happier
, about that solid young nucleus com-
"ing back is his group of veterans re-
, turning to guide them along. Two
former freshman wrestlers of the year
‘are back for another year, and the
, twosome should be Franke’s star
performers during the 1990-91 season.

The first is senior co-captain

, Larry Pilkey. Pilkey led the Generals
in five different statistical categories
y last year, most notably wins. Pilkey,
the Generals’ mainstay at 126
' pounds, brought home second place
, in the Virginia College Champion-

ships last year.
ra

j

The other is 167-pounder Peer
Soderberg. The junior co-captain, a
two-year letterman and the 1989
W&L freshman grappler of the year,
was second only to Pilkey in wins,
team points, takedowns and escapes
last year, and he had the best winn-
ing percentage on the team in dual
meets, winning four of his five bouts.

“Pilkey and Soderberg are two of
our more proven performers,’’ Franke
says. ‘‘They also should provide
some of the key leadership that this
young team will need.”’

Franke can also find some leader-
ship in senior Bill Avery, who has
struggled with injury throughout his
career but should be a key contributor
in the middle of the lineup. Avery
went 8-8 his sophomore year and is
a two-year letterwinner.

Ryland Scott, who figures to be
W&L’s top choice at 158 pounds,
registered four pins last year and was
named freshman wrestler of the year
last year. Rich Paini, back for a sec-
ond season at 118 pounds, led the
team in pins with five last year.

“T’m excited about the oppor-
tunities and challenges this season has
to offer,’’ Franke says. ‘‘I think
things are looking good, and I can’t
wait to get started.’’

Things got started for the
Generals last weekend at the VMI
Invitationals. Both Pilkey and Soder-
berg took fourth place in their respec-
tive classes, each finishing 2-2. The
Generals will next be in aciton at the
Lebanon Valley Classic Nov. 30 and
Dec.1.

SPORTS NOTEBOOK

Golf

The W&L golf team has been
picked seventh in the nation by
the Golf Coaches Association of
America’s current Division III
golf rankings.

The Generals return all of the
top six golfers from last year’s
team. W&L, the defending ODAC
champions, finished seventh in the
nation and had a final record of
38-6.

All-ODAC

The 1990 All-Old Dominion
Athletic Conference women’s
soccer and football teams were
announced, and W&L was well
represented on the first team.

Junior Nancy Mitchell was
named to the first team for the
second straight season. Joining her
was freshman Karen Stutzmann,
who led the team with 10 goals.
Junior Ashley Hurt was also
named All-ODAC. She made the
second team.

Three W&L football players
were also named first team All-
ODAC. Senior center Frank Sud-
ell, split end Craig Irons and
safety Brad Miller were all named
first team.

W&L was well represented on
the second team as well. Senior
offensive linemen’ Rob Roberton

and Rob Christensen, senior tail-
back Mason Pope, and senior
kicker Carter Quayle all made the
second team on offense. Soph-
omore defensive linemen Phillip
Spears and Thomas May, junior
linebacker Trey Cox and soph-
omore punter Bob Ehret all made
the second team on defense.

Women’s
soccer

Junior Nancy Mitchell was
named to the NCAA Division II
All-South women’s soccer team,
the school announced Wednesday.

Mitchell was one of the keys
to the best season in the short
history of W&L women’s soccer.
Mitchell led the W&L defense
that set school records for fewest
goals allowed in a season (16)
and most shutouts in a season (8).

Edwards, Hannah
selected for
all-region team

 

From Staff Reports

 

The Washington and Lee women’s
cross country team had its best finish
ever at the Division III South/South-
east Regionals, while the men’s team
recorded its best showing since 1986.

The women finished seventh and
ended the season at 8-1 (5-0 in the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference).

By finishing sixth at regionals, the
men completed the year with one of
its best performances of the season.

Junior Charles Edwards and soph-
omore Bo Hannah both finished in
the top 14 spots and were named to
the all-regional team.

Edwards finished 11th with a time
of 27:12 and Hannah was 14th with
a time of 27:27.

The men finished the season at 8-
2 (6-1 in the ODAC).

“T think our men have gained
confidence in their ability to compete
with the best, not only in our con-
ference but in the region as well,’’
said head coach John Tucker. ‘‘We
have nearly all of our top runners
coming back next year, so next sea-
son promises to be very exciting.’’

Taking over the track next will be
the W&L men and womens’ track
teams. Both have already started
training for the indoor and outdoor
track seasons.

After 10 years, Lloyd’s closes

 

By Joshua Manning
Staff Reporter

 

This weekend marked the end of
one of Lexington’s most curious
establishments. Lloyd’s of Lexington
stopped serving its ‘‘fine fast food.”’

Lloyd’s, as it is more popularly
known, has been open around the
clock since 1980. At its height, the
well known fast-food restaurant and
arcade was packed with people at all
hours. It was a popular hangout for
Washington and Lee students, locals
and cadets.

More recently, however, Lloyd’s
had fallen upon hard times. When
owner Lloyd Smith became ill seven
months ago, business dropped off. It
also suffered due to Fraternity
Renaissance which relocated a large
portion of the restaurant’s clientele.

Allegations of violence this year
severely damaged Lloyd’s reputation
among W&L istudents. Alisann
McGloin, who lives above Lloyd’s,
said, ‘‘It was just so loud up here,
we had to call the police several
times. With the fights and all, I don’t
consider it a loss.”’

Kathy Creek, Smith’s sister, had
been running the restaurant for seve-
ral months. Her main goal was rebui-

iding Lloyd’s reputation.

Several years ago, Smith put up a
temporary wall in the back of the
establishment. Last month, Creek was
planning renovations to build an
extension into the back parking lot
when the older wall collapsed.

Lexington City officials gave
either Creek or the landlord, Theo-
dore Macheras, 12 days to remedy
the situation. When Creek’s search
for a construction company exceeded
the limit, Macheras said he hired a

company to do the work. He then
billed Creek for the work, as per
Macheras’s understanding of the
rental agreement.

According to Creek, she received
an eviction notice along with the bill.
Macheras, however, denied having
ordered an eviction notice.

‘‘T certainly did not evict them,”’
said Macheras. ‘‘I’m willing to talk,
if [Creek] was short the money, we
could have worked out a settlement.
She has not even spoken to me.”’

Although the eviction notice Creek
claims to have received gave her until
the end of the month, she packed up
on Monday. By Monday evening,
only a letter to its patrons remained.

While the letter asked for help
fighting the alleged eviction, Creek
couldn’t stop the feeling that this was
the end.

‘‘T am just a single mother with
three children trying to keep Lloyd’s
business open. I really feel the city is
losing something worthwhile.”’

do in town over break

the consolation game. At 4, Friday’s
winners will meet to decide the tour-
nament championship.

On Monday, the Generals travel to
Marymount, and on next Saturday,
they'll play at Wesleyan.

VMI hits the road, too, and will
play at Virginia Tech next Saturday.

So we got entertainment, what
about food? Sorry, you’re on your
own.

The Evans Dining Hall, the Co-
op and General’s Headquarters will
all close Friday after lunch.

The dining hall will reopen for
dinner on Sunday, Nov. 25, and the
Co-op and GHQ will resume their
regular schedules the next day.

It’s okay, though, that there won’t
be any food served on campus, be-
cause you can’t take food into the
library anyway.

While not open 24 hours-a-day as

  
 

ae ot

usual, the University Library will be
open much of break.

Library hours during Thanksgiving
break are as follows:

Friday: Close at 6 p.m.

Saturday: Open 9 a.m. - 4 p.m.

Sunday: Closed

Monday - Wednesday: Open 8:30

a.m. - 4:30 p.m.

Thursday and Friday: Closed

Saturday: Open 9 a.m. - 4 p.m.

Sunday: Open at noon and resume

24 hour schedule.

If the library is just too much
excitement for you, you can always
go relax and watch a movie.

The movies playing through next
week at the State Theatre are:

Child’s Play II - a horror flick
about a doll that comes to life and
goes on a murderous rampage.

Memphis Belle - about a WWII
bomber crew trying to complete its

If you are here for break and you
still can’t keep yourself busy, take a
walk out by the river, visit the Stone-
wall Jackson house downtown, go see
the VMI museum or walk through
Stonewall Jackson cemetery. Visit
invite one of your
professors out to dinner with you, or
climb House Mountain.

During the busy rush of classes,
students often don’t get the time to
take advantage of the many histori-
cal, cultural and scenic things to see
and do in and around town.

A quiet week in Lexington might
afford that opportunity for those
staying here.

Maybe those sticking around for
break the lucky ones.
