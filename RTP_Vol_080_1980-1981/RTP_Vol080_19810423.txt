The more alcohol Washington
and Lee students drink, the
more apt they are to comment
favorably about their social life,
according to a poll conducted
during Spring term registra-
tion.

Among those who said they
drank from between 15-30
alcoholic beverages a week,
roughly 40 percent indicated
they were ‘‘very satisfied” with
W&L’s social life while almost
38 percent said they were
“somewhat satisfied.”’

The number of students who
do not drink at all but were
equally enthusiastic about the
social situation was substantial-
ly smaller, with only ten per-

cent saying they were “very ©

satisfied.”’ Almost 16 percent of
this non-aleohol consuming
group said they were “very
dissatisfied”’ with the social life
compared with but two percent
for those who drank up to 30
drinks a week.

The statistics were gathered
using a survey administered to
675 students by politics pro-
fessor William Buchanan’s
class in research methods. It
was commissioned by the Ex-
ecutive Committee following
committee discussions on
alcohol abuse at the university.

According to information
compiled by the class, figures
indicate that W&L students not
only average nine drinks during
the week, but that roughly 11
percent consume at least 25

Arita

drinks every seven days.

Fewer W&L students are non-
drinkers than have been found
in similar polls at other col-
leges. About eight percent said

 

said 4 *

idol

they never have a drink, three
percent lower than was found in
similar studies.

In results that could have an
impact on Student Activities
Board sponsored parties in the
future, the poll found that about
61 percent of all students ques-
tioned would drink soft drinks in
addition to alcohol if non-
alcoholic beverages were
available at parties. Thirteen
percent said they would drink
soft drinks instead of alcohol if
it was available while 23 per-
cent said they would drink
alcohol regardless.

According to the report issued
to the Executive Committee,
“the large proportion who
would take the soft drinks in ad-
dition to hard drinks suggests

that there is a substantial seg-
ment of the student body who
may be drinking liquor ex-
cessively when they would
prefer an alternative at some
point during the party.”’

Neil Sheehan, one of the seven
students who worked on the
poll, warned that because only
48 percent of all students
bothered to answer the ques-
tionaire, the results could be an
underestimate of drinking
habits at Washington and Lee.

Brooks Flippen, Michael
Gregory, James Herbert,
Thomas McCoy, Eden Li and
Mark Torres also were respon-
sible for the poll and report,
which will be available in both
the Executive Committee office
and library.

No Law Petitions
Received For UC

by W. Cope Moyers

Despite a recent controversy
involving the relationship be-
tween the undergraduate and
law campuses, not one petition
for law school positions on the
University Council was receiv-
ed at Monday night’s Executive
Committee meeting.

Petitions with 50 signatures
were due in the EC room by 6:30
p.m. Monday night, but at the
start of the meeting, committee
president Bob Willis announced
that none had been turned in to
the EC.

After the meeting, Willis said
he was concerned no law
students were interested in run-
ning for the University Council
position, especially since it has
been the council which has this
year examined why the two
campuses do not enjoy better
relations.

Willis also said that the coun-
cil needs a law student included
on it.

Led by Willis, the Executive
Committee recently sought to
discover why there is a rift be-
tween Lewis Hall and the Col-
onade. The split, which has
developed for reasons ranging
from separate graduation
ceremonies and _ staggered
holidays to different social

Jarrard
Receives

Award

The Virginia Psychological
Association presented Dr.
Leonard E. Jarrard, head of
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s psychology department,
with an award at the organiza-
tion’s meeting in Richmond last
week.

Jarrard received che associa-
tion’s award for Outstanding
Contribution to Psychology as a
Science.

As part of the meeting, Jar-
rard presented a paper, “‘On the
Hippocampus and Memory,”
based on his  contjnuing
research into the hippocampus,
a segment of the brain that is
associated with several serious
disorders including epilepsy.

“a

schedules, has apparently
angered some alumni and
members of the W&L Board of
Trustees. The matter was taken
up by the University Council
following the committee’s con-
cern.

Because there is a chance law
students may decide to run as
write-in candidates, the EC set
campaign guidelines. Can-
didates are allowed a five dollar
budget, 15 posters and no ban-
ners. In addition, posters are
limited to Lewis Hall.

Ina related matter, Willis an-
nounced that similar petitions
for undergraduate represen-
tatives to the University Coun-
cil are due at Monday’s EC
meeting, with the election May
4. The committee will set cam-
paign rules at the next meeting.

In other business, the com-
mittee heard a report from Eric
Myers and Neil Sheehan con-
cerning drinking at W&L. (See
article, page 1)

The committee also
unanimously agreed to recom-
mend that the Library Advisory
Committee provide sufficient
change at the front desk for
students wishing to use library
copy machines. Pete
Baumgaertner said that many
students had complained: that
there were never enough dimes
for change.

 

-W&L Bequeathed $1 Million
For Endowed Scholarship

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has received a bequest of
more than $1-million from the
estate of Egbert B. Doggett, a
1914 graduate of the university,
for the creation of an endowed
honor scholarship.

The Egbert B. Doggett
Scholarship Endowment will
fund scholarships that are to be
awarded on the basis of
academic merit, strong traits of
character, and financial need.

Doggett was a native of Dan-
ville, Va., who received his
bachelor of science degree in
civil engineering from W&l
After working as an engineer
for the city of Philadelphia im-
mediately following his gradua-
tion, Doggett served with the
603rd Engineers in the 5th Army
from July, 1918 through July,
1919.

Following the war, Doggett
joined the Bethlehem Steel
Company in Bethlehem, Pa., as
an accountant. He worked for
Bethlehem Steel from 1920 until
his retirement in 1961 as an ex-
ecutive in that company’s ac-
counting department and also
as an actuary for the pension
and relief plans for the corpora-
tion. He died on October 2, 1978.

In announcing the universi-
ty’s receipt of the Doggett be-

In other business, Sigma Nu
was reprimanded for throwing
bottles at Phi Delta Theta and
Phi Kappa Sigma. Sigma Nu
president, Beau Hodge, explain-
ed that the bottles were thrown
by a few individuals, and that
the fraternity itself was not
responsible. Hodge also stated
that his fraternity would pay for
any damage caused by the bot-
tles, and that Sigma Nu is tak-
ing disciplinary action against
those responsible.

quest, which totals $1,059,829,
Washington and Lee University
president Robert E.R. Huntley
said: ‘Mr. Doggett’s years at
Washington and Lee early in
this century were a tremendous
influence upon his life. Now,
through his foresight and
generosity, new generations of
deserving students will benefit
from the accomplishments of
his long life. We are grateful
and pleased that we are able to
honor his memory in this way.’

The Doggett Scholarship En-
dowment becomes an integral
part of the extensive financial
aid program Washington and

Lee administers annually.

Moreover, the Doggett be-
quest applies toward the goal of
$12.5-million in new endowment
that is included in the $26-
million second phase of the
university’s current develop-
ment program. After  suc-
cessfully completing the first
phase of the program in 1976 by
raising $37.5-million ($1.5-
million above the goal of $36-
million), the university has
$17.5-million in commitments
toward the second phase goal of
$26-million. The second phase is
to be concluded by December of
1981.

An unreal and ghostly mid-

Spencer Exhibits
Photography In duPont

An exhibition of the
photography of Nancy Spencer
is on display in Washington and
Lee University’s duPont
Gallery through May 8.

A 1969 graduate of Hollins
College, Ms. Spencer was a
staff photographer for
Washington and Lee from 1977
through 1979 and has been doing
freelance photography since
1978. Her works have been ex-
hibited in Richmond, Lynch-
burg, Charlottesville and
Winston-Salem, N.C.

Several of the works in the du-
Pont exhibition are the product
of Ms. Spencer’s recent ex-
perimentation with the
“Diana,” an inexpensive
plastic camera which produces
images reminiscent of the
earliest days of photography.

The ‘“‘Diana” camera, which
is no longer being produced,
may be best remembered as a
prize often awarded at car-

nivals. The camera must be
taped after loading each time to
make it light-proof. Ms.

Spencer has been working with
the ‘‘Diana”’ since participating
in a workshop in Maine in 1979.

The gallery is open daily trom
9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at no charge
to the public.

From Field

‘the staff learned control pro-
cedures the hard way — from
our mistakes. It taught us the
value of thorough coordina-

The mistakes fortunately
were few, and were corrected
during the course of the
maneuver. ‘“The FTX taught us
all the importance of flexibility
— of making rapid responses to
changing situations, and this
was true for all the cadets
here,”’ stated senior Cadet Doug
Shipman.

For the many sophomores
and freshmen who took part as
squad members, the FTX pro-
vided exposure to the military
field environment and a taste of
simulated battle — valuable
grounding for their future in
ROTC. :

John Fox summed up. “That

Film Notes

M (Germany, 1930) — Fritz Lang directs Peter Lorre in this
psychological thriller about a non-descript child-molester and
murderer finally apprehended, not by the Berlin police, but by his
fellow criminals. Originally entitled The Murderers Amongst Us,
production was halted on the film by order of the Nazi hierarchy,
who thought the title referred to the Party.

Boudu Saved From Drowning and A Day in the Country (France,
1932 and 1936) — Jean Renoir, son of the Impressionist painter,
centers his films on the water: in Boudu, the tramp of the title is
hauled out of the Seine by a bourgeois gentleman, in upon whom he
promptly moves — for good. After wreaking havoc amongst the
convential, he stands in severe danger of becoming respectable
himself, until he falls into the river again and floats away to resume
his former habits. Rather Chaplinesque.

In A Day..., Renoir adapts a tale of Maupassant’s dealing with
middle-class frivolity and seduction down by the riverside.

Baseball Team Qualifies,

Massacred By Lynchburg

by John Harrison

Perhaps the best news of spr-
ing break involved the
Washington and Lee baseball
team. The Generals reached a
milestone when they qualified
for the fifth annual Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference Cham-
pionship Tournament by taking
home doubleheaders from
Hampden-Sydney and Eastern
Mennonite.

The tournament, in which the
top four teams of the eight-team
league will participate, is the
first in which the Generals will
appear. Competition will be
provided by Randolph-Macon,
Bridgewater, and defending
champion Lynchburg. The
Hornets, loaded with talent at
every position, will host the
tournament on Saturday, April
25, at Lynchburg City Stadium.

“At the beginning of the
season I could see that we had
the talent to qualify,”’ said head
coach Craig Jones. ‘The real
key turned out to be our perfor-
mances last week. The chips
were down and we needed wins,
so the guys responded by not
giving our opponents
anything.”

Jones continued, ‘‘Early in
the season we dropped deci-
sions to some of the teams who
did not make the tournament.
We had no business losing to
these teams (Maryville and
Emory & Henry). This gave us
a poor conference record (3-5).
However, last week we got good
pitching, runs when we needed
them, and steady fielding.”

Pitching was the Generals’
strength last week, as all four
starting W&L hurlers threw
complete games. Junior Dave
Randall started off the week by
lasting all twelve innings in the
first game against Hampden-
Sydney.. Senior Tom Coates
singled in the winning run. In
the night-cap, Rich Hachen-
burg, making his last ap-
pearance before leaving for
Germany in a study-abroad pro-

gram, triumphed in a 6-3 deci-
sion.

bit more offense two days later,
against Eastern Mennonite.

The Washington and Lee var-
sity tennis team came away
with only one team victory on
their annual ‘‘southern swing’’
tour, which lasted from April
13-18.

However, by playing six
tough Division I and II teams in
as many days, the Generals
gained in match toughness and
experience what they lost in the
won-lost columns.

On April 13, the General
netmen faced Division I Emory
University and lost a 6-3 deci-
sion. Senior co-captains Pete
Lovell and Doug Gaker provid-
ed all three winning points for
W&L; Lovell won his singles
match 4-6, 6-4, 60, while Gaker
claimed his contest, 6-2, 3-6, 6-2.
Both men then combined for a
6-2, 7-5 win in doubles.

The following day, W&L
travelled to the University of
Central Florida, a Division II
team. The Generals lost the
contest 7-2, yet Gaker made it
two in a row with his 6-4, 6-4 win.
Freshman Charles Kalocsay
provided the other W&L point
with his 7-5, 6-0 victory in
singles.

While the Generals lost a 9-0
decision to Division I South
Florida on the 15th, W&L was

able to take one point off power-
ful Rollins College (Division II)
on the following day. The lone
win was registered by freshman
Scott Berman, who scraped out
his victory at fifth singles 3-6,
7-6 (5-4), 7-6 (5-4).

The only team win that the
Generals managed came
against Division I Stetson Col-
lege on April 17. Standout per-
formances were turned in by
sophomore Steve Denny, who
won his third singles match 6-2,
6-2; junior Wes Yonge, who won
6-2, 6-1 at the fourth spot, and
the freshmen Berman and
Kalocsay, who cruised to easy

victories.

The W&L netmen closed out
their southern tour with a 9-0
loss to Division I Florida on the
18th, before returning to host
the powerful University of
Maryland team on the 20th.

Although the Generals lost
the Maryland match 9-0 as well,
Lovell and Gaker turned in a
tremendous doubles _ perfor-

mance. After winning the first
set 6-2, Lovell and Gaker fell 7-5
(5-1) in the second set and 7-5
(5-2) in the third.

W&L’s next challenge will be
the ODAC tournament, schedul-
ed for April 24-25.

   

Golfers Place Fourth In Classic

by Scott Mason

Despite fears that the week-
long spring break would
hamper the steady progress of
the 1981 Washington and Lee
golf team, the Generals resum-
ed their season magnificently
by taking fourth place at the
Virginia Tech ‘‘Gobbler
Classic.”

The fourteen-team, two-day
tournament was held last Fri-
day and Saturday, and all the
players, remarked Coach Buck
Leslie, performed very well.
Leslie added that he was ex-
ceedingly proud and pleased

with the team’s effort and that.

they made a “‘strong showing
against high caliber schools ”

At the end of the first day, the
Generals jumped out to an early
lead and found themselves in
sole possession of first place.
However, due to strong perfor-
mances by Virginia Tech and
Elon College, the Generals slip-
ped the second day and rounded
out the tournament in fourth
vlace. Nonetheless, the

Generals deserve a hearty pat
on the back, said Leslie, and
should be proud of their suc-
cess.

5250 on Wilson Field. The
Generals, now 3-3 on the season
and ranked 13th in this week’s
U.S.I.L.A. Division I coaches’
poll, will travel to Chestertown,
Md. on Saturday, April 25 to
face Division III power
Washington College.

‘Washington is a team we
had better respect, especially
after a come-from-behind win
over Roanoke last Saturday,”

reports W&L head coach Jack

home runs (6) and RBI’s (18),
put the Generals ahead early
with a first-inning grandslam.
Junior Jim Brockelman held
the Royals in check, thus earn-
ing a 5-1 victory. W&L took the
second game of the twinbill as
freshman leftfielder Mike
Walsh contributed three hits, in-
cluding two doubles, and
sophomore pitcher Jim Stanley
completed the Generals’ finest
week in recent history by throw-
ing a complete game, 7-4 vic-
tory. The wins over Eastern
Mennonite, coupled with a
Randolph-Macon victory over
Hampden-Sydney that same
day, clinched the tournament
berth for W&L.

The Generals, to put it mildly,
were quickly forced to realize
the awesome capability of the
tournament competition when

opponent in the ODAC semi-
final game this Saturday, an-

improved to 8-3 following the
18-16 win over the Maroons in a
game where Roanoke held
leads of 9-3 and then 11-7 at
halftime. Washington has a
Wednesday, April 22 road game
at Western Maryland prior to
the match with W&L.

“We understand them to be
scrappy players, regardless of
the score, and ones who are
very good at coming from
behind. They are tough on their
home field, and we can’t brag
about being a good road team.
They gave us a good game last
year (a 9-7 W&L win on a soggy

Wilson Field) and we expect a

 

nihilated the Generals Tuesday
at Smith Field. The 24-4 final
score was an awesome indica-
tion of Lynchburg’s ability to hit
consistently and solidly. Even
the LC substitutes refused to let
up in the later innings and give
the Generals’ starters a chance
to make the score respectable.
Lynchburg’s bench was respon-
sible for nine runs in the final
three innings.

In yesterday’s action, the
Generals dropped a 6-5 decision
to Bridgewater, after having
led 5-4 entering the ninth inning.
W&L’s overall record now
stands at 10-9 overall, 7-7 in the
ODAC.

The Generals’ outlook for this
weekend's tourney does not look
good, and Jones admitted that
his team will be the underdog.
Prospects look even worse with

stronger one this season.”

Although Virginia proved the
stronger team last Saturday by
virtue of the final score, W&L
had its high points. The dif-
ference, according to Emmer,
was that the Generals didn’t
capitalize enough.

“We feel we had the right
game plan against Virginia, one
which allowed us to control the
ball and work for the scoring op-
portunities. We just didn’t
capitalize on the opportunities
we created. We missed some
point-blank shots and failed to
convert some extra-man_ at-
tempts.

“It’s an over-used term in the
coaching field, but we needed
better execution. When you play
control ball, you put more em-
phasis on making the most of
the opportunities you create.
We simply didn’t use all those
chances.”’

For the first twelve-and-a-
half minutes of play, neither
team managed to use any

W&L got on the scoreboard
with the first two goals of the se-
cond half to cut the UVa lead to
three. After the Cavaliers
countered with a score to make
it 6-2, sophomore attackman
Geoff Wood tallied twice to pull
the Generals within two early in
the final quarter. At that point
Virginia exploded for three
scores over a two-minute span
and took its largest lead, 9-4,
with 11 minutes left to play.
W&L scored twice in the final
three and a half minutes for the
9-6 verdict.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The Drinking Poll

Undoubtedly students and faculty alike will find the
results of the EC sponsored drinking poll of enormous
interest. After years of speculation, there is now some
reliable data as to how much alcohol the average
W&L student actually consumes.

Perhaps the most encouraging statistic is that
students would prefer non-alcoholic drinks at some
point during a party if they were offered. It is hoped
that the SAB, the IFC and individual fraternities will
take the hint and provide non-alcoholic beveriges at
their events.

Such a positive move will not only be benificial to
students, but will also be a step toward the improve-
ment of faculty-fraternity relations. Perhaps the EC
will next consider polling faculty members concern-
ing their drinking habits. The student body would un-
doubtedly find these results especially fascinating.

The Great Divide

The undergraduate-law school gap grew ever wider
this week with the failure of any law student to file a
petition for a UC position. Admittedly this is an unfor-
tunate situation, and Bob Willis and the EC should be
commended for their efforts to reconcile the two
schools. Nevertheless, it should be apparent by now
that neither undergraduates nor law students are
overly concerned in the affairs of the other.

There are just too many obvious differences in
schedules, curriculum and life styles for either school
to mesh congenially together. Besides, when neither
side is interested in interrelations with the other, how
can a solution be found?

For the present, most law students and
undergraduates are complacently resigned to the
status quo; therefore, until students’ attitudes
change, it is futile to make continuous overtures
toward unity between the two schools. Let it be!

Where Are They Now?

Noticeably absent from the Phi this spring are John
Billmyre and Bill Whalen, who have taken newspaper
internships in their hometowns. They are sorely miss-
ed from the staff as their service has been invaluable
throughout the year.

Billmyre as Editor-in-Chief and Whalen as News
Editor have continually been hardworking, efficient
and creative in their work. As journalists, they have
been consistently accurate, concise and ethical in
their reporting, always striving to maintain the high
standards of their profession.

Although their departure has left a wide gap in our
staff, we wish them the best of luck at all their jour-
nalistic endeavors.

Cockpit Needs More Support

Dear Editor,

Since the demise of the record
store it has been interesting to
hear the numerous comments
from persons who say ‘‘wish I
had known the record store was
in trouble, perhaps I would have
frequented it more.’’ There is
another campus facility that is
not being fully utilized and finds
itself in financial difficulty
—the COCKPIT.

It is my opinion that if the
Cockpit were located on Main
Street it would be doing very,
very well. However, we are not
on Main Street but rather hid-
den in the bottom of the Univer-
sity Center. Since we are not
allowed to advertise in the local
media we are locked in on a
rather small captive audience
— our own W&L Community.
Contrary to what, in some
cases, seems to be common
knowledge in the Lexington
community, the COCKPIT is
open to the public and we do en-
courage them, by word or
mouth, to try our cuisine. At
lunch you will routinely find a
dozen or so faculty members
who are regular customers, half
a dozen students and a few off-
campus guests. At dinner you
will see a dozen or so students, a
faculty member or two, and a
few outside guests. If you hap-
pen to come by on a night when
there is a band you will pro-
bably see the entire student
body (somewhat of an exag-
geration since we only have 160
seats). Why isn’t the Cockpit
getting more business from the
campus community? I doubt
there is much question that we
have the nicest room and the
cheapest prices in town for a
comparable menu. The food is
good as well as inexpensive. Ad-
mittedly, when we do get an oc-
casional rush the service may
be somewhat slower but a ‘‘nor-
mal work schedule”’ is based on
‘normal business’, and our
business at lunch and dinner is
slow.

We have made every effort to
attract additional student
business. We built a stage for
the SAB to bring in bands. We

 

took out the juke box and in-
stalled an FM/tape recording
system. We purchased a wide-
screen TV. We have offered
special after special: happy
hour, 30 cent hot dogs, '2 price
french fries, free popcorn, etc.,
etc. (See ad elsewhere in this
paper). We have a soup and
sandwich special and a salad

  

bar every day at lunch. The
COCKPIT provides numerous
student jobs with a payroll of
about $2500 per month and is
managed by students at night.
In conclusion, the COCKPIT
is your student tavern and it
needs your support. It needs the
continued support of the SAB,
providing bands for the student
body, that it got during the fall
term. We need your input as to
what more would you like us to
do to upgrade your tavern? If
the COCKPIT is a viable enter-
tainment center for you on cam-
pus and you want it to continue,
please let us know, by your
presence and your suggestions
— before it is too late.
Sincerely,
Gerald J. Darrell
Director of Food Service

Biography

Dr. Roger B. Jeans Jr.,
associate professor of history at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, has been awarded a
research grant from the
Maurice L. Mednick Memorial
Fund for study this summer.

Jeans will use his Mednick
research grant to further his
work on a biography of Carsun
Chang, a well-known 20th cen-
tury Chinese philosopher and
politician.

The Mednick Memorial Fund
is administered by the Virginia
Foundation for Independent
Colleges (VFIC), a joint fund-
raising consortium of 12 four-
year private colleges in the
State, including W&L.

Jeans’ research will include
exploration of the holdings on
20th century China of the Public
Record Office in London and in-
vestigation of the British
Museum’s collection of English
language treaty’ port
newspapers. He also plans
research at the National Ar-
chives in Washington and in-
vestigation of material

deposited with the Chinese Oral -

   
 

Asian history and has written
numerous articles on that sub-
ject.

The Mednick Memorial Fund
was created in 1976 after the ac-
cidental death of the young Nor-
folk industrialist. His family
and business associates
established the fund _ to
perpetuate his name and to
recognize his own strong in-
terest in higher education.

The VFIC administers the
fund to encourage the profes-
sional development of college
teachers and improve their
competence through grants for
research and advanced study,
and to assist highly qualified,
needy students in their up-
perclass years in college.

 

Robert P. Fure has been nam-

Stewart Composition

To Be Performed

A musical composition by
Washington and Lee University
music professor Robert Stewart
will be presented by the Brass
Chamber Music Society of An-
napolis, Md., on Sunday, April
26, in Annapolis.

The Brass Quintet No. 3, one
of the three concerts in the
series, was originally composed
as a ballet but has been per-
formed without dancers in the
past.

The Annapolis performance
will be the first with dancers.

The Murray Spaulding Dance
Theater will perform the ballet,
choreographed by Murray
Spaulding. The Annapolis Brass
Quintet will perform the piece.
The Quintet is described as ‘‘a

combination of rugged expres- _

sionism and lyricism in an
atonal idiom.”

Stewart, who received three
master of music degrees from
the American Conservatory in
Chicago, has been a member of
the Washington and Lee faculty
