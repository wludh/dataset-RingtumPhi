Watergate “mastermind” G. Gordon Liddy

O >

Liddy Speaks Monday

G. Gordon Liddy, a former
staff assistant to Richard Nixon
and the acknowledged master-
mind of the Watergate break-in,
will speak Monday night at 8
p.m. in Lee Chapel.

Liddy, whose conspicuous
silence set him apart from most
other Watergate defendants,
spent four-and-a-half years in
prison for his part in the break-
in and his refusal to cooperate
with investigators. In recent
months, Liddy has again caught
the public’s attention with his
new book, Will, in which he
discloses plots to kill fellow
White House plumber Howard
Hunt and columnist Jack
Anderson.

Liddy’s visit to Washington
and Lee is sponsored by Con-
tact, an organization directed
jointly by the Intrafraternity
Council and the W&L student

government. Liddy’s fee of
$3600 is considerably higher
than the usual $2500-3000 spent
to attract lecturers, but Liddy
brings with him some im-
pressive credentials.

According to former contact
member Bruce Poole, ‘Liddy
has been described by the
Washington Post as the most
sought after campus speaker of
his time. He should be an in-
teresting speaker.”’

So if you can tear yourself
away from studying for exams,
drop by Lee Chapel for what
promises ‘to be an interesting
lecture from the controversial
G. Gordon Liddy.

WLUR:

by Cope Moyers

Don’t let his title as assistant
professor of journalism and
general manager of Washington
and Lee’s radio station fool you.
Bob de Maria sometimes feels
like he’s managing a women’s
shoe store.

It is hard to find another radio
station quite like WLUR,
Washington and Lee University
Radio. With the exception of
two engineers, the entire staff is
comprised of students from the
university. Programming is
unique, offering the listener a
wide and varied range of news
and music, some popular and
some obscure. And the main
purpose of the station, accord-
ing to de Maria, is to train
future broadcasters and jour-
nalists.

Student

Sleuth

Recovers Goods

A Washington and Lee stu-
dent, performing a little detec-
tive work of his own, recovered
over $1500 worth of property
and helped Lexington police ar-
rest suspects in the incident.

Russell Rector, a junior,
claims that his house, located at
307 N. Main St., was broken into
twice during a five-day period
before Thanksgiving vacation.
Rector stated that he and his
roommate, Sam. Stroud, lost
over $1800 from the break-ins.

According to Rector, the first
break-in occured on Monday,
Nov. 10, at which time a stereo,
a box of cash, and a pair of
speakers, all totalling $1500,

were taken. Rector claims that
the second break-in occurred on

Friday, Nov. 14, at which time
he and Stroud lost a tapedeck,
an unknown amount of cash,
and a pellet gun, all worth over
$300.

Rector believes that both in-
cidents occured between 6:30
p.m. and 10 p.m., when he and
Stroud are normally out of the
house.

After the second break-in took
place, Rector said he went to a
location where he believed he
would find several people he
suspected to be involved in the
incidents. Rector claims he
found one of his missing
cassette tapes while at this loca-
tion, and he returned to his
house.

After waiting five minutes,
Rector said he returned to the
location, where he confronted a
youth who had since shown up.
Rector said the youth, who
claimed to be involved in three

“‘My job is so appealing be-
cause it’s fun watching students
grow into broadcasters while
having a good time,’’ de Maria
says. “It’s a growing ex-
perience.”’

Because the station serves as
both a public radio station and
journalism laboratory, mis-
takes that often occur don’t go
unnoticed by the public. Besides
dead air time associated with
students failing to make their
shifts and relatively minor
mistakes with pronunciation
and operating station equip-
ment, there are times when de
Maria feels his heart stop. He
recounts how one early morning
DJ played the actual emergen-
cy tape warning of an imminent
disaster instead of the test tape.

(See WLUR; page 9)

other robbery cases in another
state, promised to help Rector if
Rector promised not to inform
the police of his whereabouts.

Rector then claimed that the
youth appeared at Rector’s
house on Sunday, bringing with
him the missing stereo and a
tapedeck which apparently did
not belong to either Rector or
Stroud. Rector said his infor-
mant provided him with names
and information which led to
the recovery of $1500 of the
$1800 in missing goods.

Rector said his next move
was to call a friend, who had
also had some merchandise
stolen, and a member of the
Lexington police force. Rector
said he and the police officer
waited for the informant to
return, but instead, another
person appeared unexpectedly.

Rector said that the police,
once provided with names and
addresses of break-in suspects,
obtained search warrants. Rec-
tor said that the police have
since recovered over $3000 in

Judicial Board
Clarifies Penalty

Individuals Can Compete
In Intramurals

by Mike Perry

The Interfraternity Council
Judicial Board met Tuesday
night to clarify the punishment
it handed down to the Pi Kappa
Phi fraternity for hazing a
representative from its national
organization.

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee asked the IFC to decide
whether Pi Phi members will be
permitted to compete in in-
tramurals and under what con-
ditions, before the university
committee would review the the
IFC’s punishment decision.

IFC President Monty Briscoe
announced that Pi Phi mem-
bers may participate in future
intramural competition as in-

dividuals or in groups as long as
they did not compete under Pi
Phi’s name.

The Judicial Board also
decided to allow the Pi Phi’s to
hold a Christmas party for Lex-
ington children, but denied Pi
Phi’s request to allow women to
be permitted to attend and help
out. Women are forbidden
under IFC rules to enter frater-
nity houses during probation.

Pi Phi President Clyde Hark-
rader told the IFC that this rule
puts fraternity presidents in a
difficult position when they
must sign a statement at the
end of the probation period that
the fraternity has abided by all

Lexington’s police depart-
ment is also _ investigating
several fraternity house break-
ins over the Thanksgiving
break.

Police reports indicate that
on November 26 the Pi Kappa

Alpha and Beta Theta Pi frater-
nities were entered. Some fur-
niture was stacked in the PIKA
house, but nothing was stolen.

And, acting on a report,the
police went to the Sigma Chi
fraternity, where they chased
off several men.

Ariel To Be Released

The new issue of Ariel,
Washington and Lee’s biannual
literary magazine, will be
available at the end of next
week, according to co-editor
Channing Hail.

The 40-page edition will con-
tain five short stories, a number
of poems and an_ unusual
amount of photography, Hall
said. For the first time in recent
years the four winning entries
of the annual Mahen competi-
tion will be published in Ariel.

EC Holds
Meeting

Only two matters were
discussed at Monday night’s
Executive Committee meeting.

President Bob Willis read the
committee a letter from Lex-
ington Mayor and university
professor Charles Phillips con-
cerning university security.
The letter stated the city coun-
cil’s policy on security for W&L
students, promising more
cooperation between the police
department and students.

Secretary Bud White reported
that about $500 in new recording
equipment had been received
and would soon be in operation.
The committee had approved a
motion to buy new equipment
for EC use at
meeting. The meeting ended at
6:45 p.m.

The magazines, which will be
ready next Thursday or Friday,
have in the past been
distributed in stacks in the
University Library, the W&L
Bookstore and the Law School.
The practice is expected to con-
tinue this year.

Hall said he and co-editor An-
drew Trotter had a _ large
amount of written material to
sift through this year, and
photographs were chosen from
45 entries.

William Ashe reported to the
police on November 30 that his

_ house on 108 North Randolph

Street had been broken into and
a pair of speakers stolen.

Kevin Carney reported that
-wo speakers, valued at $160,
had been taken from his room in
the Graham-Lees Dormitory,
but that they were recovered by
che police and returned to him
later that same day.

Carney said he thinks the
thief used a pass key to get in
the room because there was no
sign of forced entry.

Head Dormitory counselor
Jake Purcell said that in the
past pass keys to the freshman
dormitories have been lost or
stolen and because the locks
have not been switched, there is
a possibility that people from
outside the W&L community
have the keys.

SeniorsChosen For
Business Conterence

Two seniors at Washington
and Lee University were chosen
to participate in a_na-

tional student conference spon-
sored by “Business Today’’
magazine on the topic of public

policy and private enterprise
last month in New York City.

Kevin B. Dwyer, an English
major from Leesburg, Va., and
Joseph Robles, a sociology ma-
jor from Vincentown, N.J.,
were among 200 students
chosen for the ‘‘Business
Tomorrow VI’ national con-
ference from among more than
1,400 applicants. The Founda-
tion for Student Communica-
tion, a non-profit organization
whose goal is improving com-
munication between students
and executives, sponsors the

   

Dwyer
program annually, in addition
to publishing ‘Business To-
day,” the nation’s largest
student-operated publication.
Participants heard business
executives and academicians
discuss business and govern-

mental concerns. Speakers will
include former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger and
former Secretary of Commerce
Juanita Kreps. ‘

Christmas Dance

by Frank Billingsley

Space considerations have forced the Student
Activities Board to limit ticket sales for tomorrow
night’s Christmas dance to 300 couples. The SAB
event will be held-in Evans Dining Hall and
feature Cymbol 8 and Board of Oz. Tickets are
$5.00 per couple and available at the University
Center.

When asked why the SAB is sponsoring a dance
that allows less than 25 percent of the student body
to attend, Co-chairman Pryse Elam explained
that 600 people is all the Dining Hall can safely
hold. This number was arrived at by counting the
number of squares on the dining hall floor and
allowing two persons per square.

During Fancy Dress many more people are
allowed in the dining hall, but Elam says the SAB
uses the entire student center for Fancy Dress and
even then the fire code is stretched. Elam added

people.

 

SAB To Limit Ticket Sales

that Gerry Darrell wanted the limit to be set at 200

Elam said that Doremus gymnasium was not

available for the dance because a basketball tour-
nament will be in progress in Warner gym. Zoll-
man’s Pavilion was also an impossibility because
the bands consider the facility ‘‘second rate’’ and
refuse to play there.

“It’s simply a lack of facilities. We face this
problem every time we have an event,’’ Elam
said.

Elam also said that the dance will be paid for
almost entirely by ticket sales, so the SAB is not
sponsoring a dance for a small percentage of peo-
ple with student body funds.

In reality, however, revenue from ticket sales
will only amount to $1,500 while the dance itself
will cost well over $2,500.

For those 600 people, Cymbol 8 and Band of Oz
will be alternating one hour sets beginning at 8:30
tomorrow night. Cymbol 8 is a soul-funk group out
of Charlotte, North Carolina, while Band of Oz
specializes in beach and shag.

The program is not merely a
speed-reading course. Its
techniques are designed to in-
crease reading speed, to
strengthen comprehension, to
improve recall, to sustain con-
centration and to deepen
analysis. A student uses his own
classroom reading materials
rather than mass-prepared in-
structional literature and
mechanical training aids.

This program will be con-
ducted on the Washington and
Lee campus by an instructor
from Baldridge Reading from
January 12 through February
16. Scheduling will be flexible to
accommodate individual stu-
dent schedules, and classes will
be small to permit necessary in-
dividual attention. Each stu-
dent will attend a total of twenty
sessions, five per week. Tuition
for the program will be $65,
payable by the start of the pro-
gram upon receipt of a state-
ment from Baldridge.

Further information and
registration cards may be ob-
tained from the Office of the
Dean of Students, Payne Hall 6.
Interested students should
register for the course as soon
as possible.

 

Dress is semi-formal and beer will be for sale.

Professors Stay On Despite Job Insecurity

by Chris Peacock

Three untenured English pro-
fessors are back this year
despite assertions to the con-
trary last year. The reason,
they say, is a lack of jobs and an
overabundance of job-seekers. -

Robert Fure, Carren Kaston
and John Swift, all fourth-year
assistant professors of English,
said last year that they were
leaving Washington and Lee
because any additional time
spent here would be detrimen-
tal to their chances of receiving
tenure at another college or
university. As Kaston said last
winter, ‘‘It’s not in our best in-
terests to stay here.”’

The problem with staying was
that the national teachers’
union guidelines give beginning
professors seven years to
receive tenure, and W&L’s
English department is ‘‘tenured
up.” Any chances for obtaining
tenure would have to be at
another college, and would like-
ly require several years in
residence for the professors to
prove themselves.

But when they began looking,
none could find a more accep-
table employment situation. So,
they are back, hoping for but.
not optimistic about securing.
tenured positions elsewhere.

Assistant Professors of

English Robert Fure, Carren
Kaston and John Swift took jobs
at W&L with the realization that
they probably would be unable
to receive tenure. The English
department has only one ten-
ured position open and it wants
to keep it open to allow for flex-
ibility within the department,
said Swift. This being the case,
all three are actively seeking
employment at other schools.

The glut of prospective

English professors in the
market has made landing a
position next to impossible.
Swift said he had been looking
for another job for ‘‘roughly a
year,’’ but has been unable to

find a comparable position.

 

 

Carren Kaston

 

“The employment situation for
teachers in general is not
good,” he said. ‘It’s an
employer’s market.’’

As is the case with Fure and
Kaston, Swift likes the mixture

 

John Swift

at landing a satisfactory teach-
ing position. He said that
because of personal and family
considerations, he wants a per-
manent job, even if he has to
leave the teaching profession to

nn.
‘The problems seems to boil down to
the fact that there are too many
teachers and not enough students.
So, despite spending a number of

years working on a Ph.D.

these

professors find themselves with little

job security’

 

of upper-and lower-level
courses he teaches at W&L.
However, he would not want to
teach exclusively at the begin-
ning level. And that is basically
the only type position he has
found available.

Fure has about given up hope

   
   

 

find one. “I will not take
another temporary position,”
he said. ‘“‘At 35 I don’t want
another year-to-year appoint-
ment. It’s too much of a
burden...Unfortunately, the
trend is toward temporary
jobs.”’

He emphasized the ‘‘tremen-
dous supply of cheap labor’’ in
the form of teachers available
to colleges, and cited a recent
survey study which showed that
in the next 10 years, 10 percent

of those with Ph.D.’s in English
would be able to land tenure
tract jobs.

Fure is pessimistic about the
possibility of landing another
teaching job for next year, and
predicts that he may well end
up in another field, such as
business. There, he said, he
would probably have a job
which would use his gram-
matical skills — ‘‘Vice Presi-
dent in charge of commas”’
—but which would take him
away from the study and
teaching of poetry.

Fure, who estimated that he
spends approximately 60 hours
each week on his work, pre-
dicted that should he take a job

in business, it would probably
mean “‘making more money do-
ing something which takes less
work.” But, he added, ‘‘I won’t
have the opportunity to make a
living doing what I love.”’

Kaston, who has one year of
her appointment remaining
after the current school year,
has also been looking for a per-
manent job. But she, like Fure
and Swift, has had little luck.

She said that persons in the
“assistant professor’ category
have an especially hard time
finding jobs. Most of the avail-
able jobs are for those just out
of graduate school. Swift said,
“This is because the salary
demands are lower, and begin-
ning teachers have more time
before a tenure decision must
be made.”

Kaston said, ‘“‘The profession
needs to recognize the fact that
we (assistant professors) are
valuable people.’’ She pointed
out that they have just as much
training as the beginners, plus
much more teaching ex-
perience.

The problem seems to boil
down to the fact that there are
too many teachers and not
enough students. So, despite
spending a number of years
working on a Ph.D. and writing
manuscripts and articles, and
doing additional outside re-
search, these professors find
themselves with little job
security. Fure said, ‘We are
confronted with a_ situation
where we cannot expect to con-
tinue in our profession. I’m still
looking, but not with much op-
timism.”’

He called his situation ‘‘some-

thing of a reversal” of one of
George Bernard Shaw’s quota-
tions. Shaw said, “Those who
Maybe it

can’t do, teach.’

should be, ‘Those who can’t
teach, do.

Live From New York... ”
Saturday Night Live ’80

 

Met With Boos and Hisses

by John Wells

Anyone who watched the premiere of Saturday
Night Live ’80 with high expectations was rightful-
ly disappointed. Although much of the material is
no worse than anything seen on the original, there
is an obvious void left by the old stars, who had
carried on successfully for a year after the major
loss of John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd to Holly-
wood. It seems impossible that any ensemble
could live up to the creativity, energy and ver-
satility that distinguished the original cast.

Television

 

The new show, which began last Saturday, was
met with a barrage of complaints and criticism.
Tom Shales, the vitrolic video pundit, reported in
The Washington Post that the NBC switchboard in
New York received more than 400 complaints
about the show, an unusually high number. Shales
himself described the show as ‘“‘Vile...a snide and
sordid embarrassment...haplessly pointless taste-
lessness...Cro-Magnon comedy...’ etc., etc.

Well, now, really. The show was nothing to cheer
about, but its content is no more snide or tasteless
than anything we’ve seen in the same time slot
since 1975. The old SNL was capable not only of
first-rate entertainment, but it would also be
tediously gross, and it often sent folks to bed be-
tween Weekend Update and the guest band’s sec-
ond appearance.

Many of the complaints registered were about
one of the opening skits, set in the Oval Office with
the Carter family. Except for the Amy character,
it was a letdown, no doubt brought on by memories
of Aykroyd and Laraine Newman, who portrayed
the presidential couple in several inspired
routines. The new skit was less subtle in its at-
tacks on the Carters, who are seen discussing how
the White House has affected their love life (‘It’s
the election or the erection’’). The first lady unbut-
tons her dress and reclines on the president’s desk
to wait for you-know-what.

If this is a bon voyage to Jimmy and Rosalynn,
heaven help Ronnie and Nancy during the next
four years.

Akron Beacon Journal Editor and Vice President Paul A. Poor-

Editor Addresses

Journalism Ethics

by John Ran Smith

The legal question of the
privacy of citizens is the biggest
problem of the future for jour-
nalists. Says Paul A. Poorman,
the editor and vice-president of
the Akron Beacon Journal. He
lectured during the seventh an-
nual Washington and Lee In-
stitute on the Ethics of Jour-
nalism, Friday night.

“The concept of freedom has
changed,”’ Poorman remarked.
“There is no law regarding the
privacy of private citizens, and
the courts will rule in favor of
the rights of privacy for the
citizen, infringing upon the
freedom of speech dictated by
the First Amendment.” —

Poorman cited two chal-
lenges for the newspaper in to-
day’s world: marketing and the
social responsibility of the jour-
nalist.

“Are newspaper investiga-
tions brought about to sell

papers or to correct society?”’
He asked the audience in his
Friday night speech.

It is imperative that a news-
paper make money to remain in
society, he said. The social
responsibility of the journalist
as the watchdog of society must
be remembered also.

“The journalist makes the
news by selecting and pub-
lishing what he believes is the
most important news,” he said.
“‘We have enormous power, but
we don’t always use it proper-
ly.”

Poorman stressed the impor-
tance of an absolute ruling of
the First Amendment as the
most important thing for the
journalist to have in his favor.

“‘T would like to live in a world
where the First Amendment
ruling were absolute,’’ he said.
“I believe that freedom of
speech is an absolute necessi-

ty.”

(continued from page 4)

Far funnier ridicule was heapea un the Carters
by the original writers and cast; they were also
responsible for equally questionable taste over the
years.

Remember the ‘‘Miles Cawperwaithe”’ series in
which Eric Idle emptied foul containers of drool
into a bucket? How about the Nixon skits in which
Pat was frankly portrayed as a foul-mouthed
alcoholic? Or anything conceived and written by
Michael O’Donoghue?

The stand-outs in the new cast were Denny’

Dillon, a chubby blonde, and a skinny lunatic nam-
ed Charles Rocket, who replaces Chevy Chase-
Jane Curtain-Billy Murray as anchorperson of
Weekend Update.

Miss Dillon is suitably whacky and came off
very well in several skits, as Amy Carter, and asa
Jewish talk show co-hostess in “Pinky and Leo
Waxman.”

Rocket, who is intermittently good-looking be-.

tween dire facial contortions, was very funny as a
singing telegram reader, and he pulled the news
off without a hitch (the news has returned to the
stark, unpolished format of the show’s early
days). Rocket may prove to be a more likable jerk
than Chevy Chase was.

The other members — Ann Risley, Gail Mat-
thius, Joe Piscopo and Gilbert Gottfried — all
display individual talent, but only time will tell if
they can develop as stunning a repetoire of char-
acterizations as any one of their predecessors.
But, again, who could replace even the most
underrated SNL veteran, Garrett Morris, who was
great as every remotely black male or female he
played, from Pear] Bailey to Anwar Sadat?

My guess is that the show will be commercially
successful, if not the artistic equivalent of the

Saturday Night Live

original. The format is the same, there is a new,
expensive-looking set, Don Pardo still announces
the opening credits over postcard shots of Manhat-
tan, and new features, like short films by famous
directors, will be shown weekly.

In the meantime, the Coneheads, Roseanna Ro-
seannadanna, the Widebutts, Enid and Lisa
Lupner, Samurai Hotel Clerk and the Bees have
all joined Edith Bunker, the Ricardos and the
Mertzes, Uncle Miltie and Gomer Pyle somewhere
in video heaven.

That’s all, folks.

Follow-up:

A week after writing this article I watched the
second installment of the new show. It, too, was
met with a barrage of outcries, this time regard-
ing a skit about Commie Hunting Season in North
Carolina. Now there is talk at NBC about per-
manently replacing SNL with a new series.

To consider dropping the show at such an early
date is unfortunate. Let it be remembered the
earliest broadcasts of the old series contained
some awful stuff, too.

The second show, hosted by Malcolm McDowell,
had some good material; a skit with McDowell
and Ann Risley in a Gothic romance bookstore
was especially clever. Charlie Rocket continued to
excel with a boffo newscast and hilarious ‘‘man on
the street”’ interviews filmed on New York’s Fifth
Avenue.

Again, I saw nothing on the new show which I
considered any more offensive than material from
the old one. It would be a shame to cancel it
prematurely.

FALL AWARDS

Several members of the
Washington and Lee soccer and
football programs have receiv-
ed post-season recognition from
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
terence. The honors, which in-
clude Coach-of-the Year,
Player-of-the Year, and All-
Conference laurels, were an-
nounced at the ODAC fall
meetings, which took place
Tuesday, Nov. 18in Staunton.

The conference’s soccer
Coach-of-the-Year award went
to W&L’s Rolf Piranian, who
had also received the honor in
1977 and shared it in 1979. Pira-
nian, who this fall completed his
fifth year as the Generals’
director, led W&L to a 9-4-0
record, the team’s first winning
mark since 1973.

Bryan Williams, a W&L
senior from Richmond, Va.,
earned the ODAC’s soccer
Player-of-the-Year accolade. A
three-year W&L starter,
Williams played in 12 games
this fall and scored four goals
from his midfield position.

Williams and teammate Brad
Poorman, a sophomore from
Wilmington, De., were both
selected to the eleven-man All-
Conference team. Poorman, a
forward, paced W&L in scoring
this fall with 18 points (six goals

and six assists).

In football, four Generals
received first-team All-
Conference recognition and six
more earned second-team
laurels.

W&L’s first-team award reci-
pients are: senior Chris Leiser,
a wide receiver from Chester
Heights, Pa. and, ironically,
W&L’s leading rusher this fall
with 555 yards; senior Chip
Nunley, a Bristol, Va. resident
and a three-year starter at of-
fensive tackle; junior Mike
Fogarty, a tight end from Alex-
andria, Va. and 1980 team
leader in receiving with 22
catches for 352 yards; and
junior Mike Pressler, a defen-
sive lineman from _ Wilton,
Conn. and second-leading W&L
tackler in 1980. :

Second-team W&L players
are: running back Chris
Cavalline, a sophomore from
St. Mary’s, Pa.; guard Jim
Forte, a senior from Cranford,
N.J.; center Jon Hendler, a
senior from Ambler, Pa.;
defensive end Tom Noble, a
junior from Pilot Knob, N.Y.;
linebacker John McKee, a
junior from Clarksdale, Miss. ;
and defensive back Don Keller-
man, a sophomore from Alex-
andria, Va.

 

 

Odds And Ends.

—First, some belated congratulations must go
both the football team and the soccer team. As
most everyone who reads this section knows, the
football team has long been the whipping boy of
our sports writers. Well, everyone has his day in
the sun, and the same held true for this year’s
gridmen. 6-4 may not seem like a big deal to alot of
people, but its a long way from 2-8 and 3-7 perfor-
mances. Meanwhile, the soccer team tied the
school record for most wins in a season, beating
the likes of Navy, which has knocked off Division I
playoff teams. Maybe in the future, someone will
realize that lacrosse and football are not theonly
sports played on Wilson Field.

—The basketball team has started — or has
anyone cared to notice? Does anyone care,
anyway” The basketball team plays tomorrow in
Warner Center, probably to its usual overflowing
crowd of 200-300 people. Someday, the student
body may realize that W&L basketball games are
a little more than an excuse to blow off studying.

—We're now less than four months away from
the beginning of the lacrosse season. We certainly
hope that a few members of the lacrosse team
decide to may a good contribution to the team this
year like managing not to flunk out of school.

—On the national scene, George Rogers walked
off with the Heisman Trophy — to no one’s sur-
prise since he is a running back. Maybe someday
the fine gentlemen who organize this award will
realize that there are more positions than running
back or quarterback. Perhaps more than one
trophy should be handed out. Perhaps there should
have been more than one winner this year.
Perhaps Herschel Walker will win the next three
trophies...

—The N.F.L. continues to grind through what
seems like the longest season ever. Looking for
early - favorites for the Super Bowl? Try
Philadelphia in the N.F.C. and whoever wins the
Central Division of the A.F.C. Meanwhile, look for

the Eagles, Cowboys, Lions (if they don’t gag their
division away), Rams and Falcons. In the A.F.C.,
the smart money is riding on the Bills, Patriots
(who will make it despite all efforts to throw it
away), Browns, Oilers, and Chargers. We won't
dare predict a final winner.

—Speaking of pro boxing — if you want to term
certain pro bouts as ‘boxing’ matches — the ver-
dict is still out on the Duran-Leonard fix, excuse
us, fight. Pity our poor amigo, Roberto, he fought
for almost eight rounds, suffered a bad tummy
ache, and only got $8 million for his efforts. It
should keep him in steaks and Alka-Aeltzers for a
long time to come — at least until his rematch with
Sugar Ray (surprise! ).

—College hoops have now officially gotten
underway, though they never seem to end. Can
Virginia finally achieve the national title it so
desperately craves to justify its sports program?
Will Louisville find life after Dunkenstein? Will
Syracuse and St. Johns bring respectability to the
Big East? Will the ACC play itself into the ground
again? Will they ever decide who really is No. 1?

—Back to college football, can “them Dogs”’
survive the loss of their coach and take the na-
tional title? It looks unlikely from our viewpoint,
there's something about facing the Irish in a title
game that strikes fear in the hearts of football
players (just ask the Bear). Of course, the Irish
never faced a horse like Mr. Walker. Expect a true
classic from the Superdome. You can have the
rest of the bowl games, they only count for money,
money and more money...

—At some distant point in the future, both the
N.H.L. and the N:B.A. will get around to finishing
its playoffs. As one magazine noted a few years
ago: ‘You know its summer when the grass needs
mowing, the kids want to go to the pool, the Pen-
nant races are haeting hope, and the N.B.A. finals
are beginning.”’

Enough thoughts for now. Enjoy what's left of
this term.

Fencing, A New Wrinkle In W&L Sports

by Ralph Frasca

A relatively new wrinkle in
W&L sports is the fencing team,
a non-varsity sport coached by
Dr. Jim Worth. In their season
opener, Worth’s charges de-
feated third-ranked U.Va. a few
Saturdays ago. However, be-
fore I go any further, perhaps I

should attempt a brief overview |

of this fast-paced throwback to
the Middle Ages, in which sharp
reflexes and keen hand-eye
coordination are requisite.

There are three divisions of
competition: foil, epee, and
sabre. The foil is a more basic
weapon than the other two. The
lone viable target is the torso,
which can be hit only by the
point of the sword. Hits are
determined by an electrical
device hooked up to the protec-
tive suit. Also, a ‘‘Right-of-
way” rule exists in this division
of competition, which states
that when a fencer has his arm
extended in an attack, his foe
must block that attack and may
not launch an assault of his own
until after the aggressor has
been fended off.

The epee has no such rule,

and differs from the foil in that
it is a larger weapon, and the

whole body is fair game. Simi-
larities are that the sword point
is the only method of contact
and hits are also electronically
measured.

In sabre competition, the
most aggressive and frenzied of
the three, hits may be scored
with either the point of the
sword or by slashing. The tar-
get is the waist upwards, and
like the foil there is a right-of-
way rule. There are no elec-
tronic measuring devices in
sabre, only judgment calls by
the referee.

In all three divisions, five hits
signifies a victory, and nine
bouts are waged. The overall
winner is determined by the
most victories of the 27 total
bouts.

So much for Frasca’s Short
Course on Fencing.

In the inaugural meet, the
W&L sabre team blanked U.Va.
9-0, as ace fencer Clyde Hark-
rader won all three of his bouts.
Rich Ordway, Todd Hanks and
Pat Berg each scored two vic-
tories.

U.Va. edged the W&L foil
team, 6-3. Steve King triumph-
ed twice, and Willy Mackie
chipped in with a victory. King

is a gutsy swordsman who
never gives an inch, whose bold
and flamboyant attacks are
reminiscent of Mick Jagger
prancing about on stage. Duel-
ling well but emerging winless
were Lee Kaplan, Glenn Wil-
mar, and Rebecca Lovingood,
an exchange student from Mary
Baldwin College who almost
stole the show with some fine

swordplay against U.Va.’s top
fencer.

The epee team fared little bet-
ter, losing 5-4, despite two vic-
tories from team captain Bill
Sherwin. Rich Hepler, last
years’s top-ranked Epee fencer
in Virginia, won one of three,
while freshman Rick Swagler

befell a similar fate.

One question looms ever
larger in the minds of Dr. Worth
and his fencers — should fenc-
ing become a varsity sport?

If the team opted to turn var-
sity, they could get school funds

   

to buy new and better equip-

ment. Currently, the team
members must buy all their
own equipment, which is very
costly. Several excellent
fencers were forced to refrain
from joining the team due to
their inability to afford the ex-
pensive gear. A varsity team

would have a full-time, salaried
coach which, despite his devo-
tion to the team, Dr. Worth is
not. The fencers could also re-
ceive a varsity letter and
Physical Education credits, as
is the practice with other school
sports. By restricting the par-
ticipants to those who are ‘‘good
enough,”’ a higher level of quali-
ty could be attained, and the
team would gain state-wide
recognition. Finally, varsity
status would force a commit-
ment from the Athletic Depart-
ment and ‘‘legitimize’’ the sport
in the eyes of the student body
and the fencers themselves.

On the other side of the coin,
the team practices may become
more rigid and demanding,
necessitating several hours a
day, five days a week from the
team members and Dr. Worth.
The team would have to limit its
competition to one league, as
opposed to the freedom it cur-
rently possesses in determining
its opponents. Inevitably, a cut
system would be employed, pro-
hibiting many interested
fencers from participating in
matches or even working out
with the team.
Cagers Win Opener

The Washington and Lee var-
sity basketball team opened up
its 1980-81 season by winning the
W&L Tip-Off Tournament held
November. 28-29-at the Warner
Athletic Center.

Along with W&L, the other
teams competing were Lock
Haven State College of Lock
Haven, Pa.; Mt. Union College
of Alliance, Ohio; and Thomas
College of Waterville, Maine.

“Obviously, we are pleased to
win,’”’ stated head coach Verne
Canfield. “But I was not totally
pleased with the team’s overall

performance. We lacked con-
sistency and a sustained inten-

sity — but that will develop as

W&L defeated Thomas in the
first round, 79-76. Senior center
Rob Smitherman led a balanced
scoring attack, netting a team-
high 18 points. Starting guards
Carby Hoy (senior co-captain)
and junior George Spears each
scored 16 points, while forward
R.J. Scaggs (senior co-captain)
added 13.

In the championship round
W&L faced Mt. Union, a team
which had defeated Lock Haven

erman was named the tourney’s
Most Valuable Player.

“I must stress the excellent
leadership that we are getting
from our three seniors (Scaggs,
Smitherman and Hoy),’’ noted
Canfield. ‘Scaggs had a great
tournament defensively and
both Smitherman and Hansen
grabbed a lot of important re-
bounds.’’ In the two games com-
bined, Smitherman and Hansen
pulled in 15 and 16 rebounds,
respectively.

“The offensive flow of the
team is beginning to develop,”’
Canfield commented on the pro-

 

gress of his team. ‘‘This team
does some things, such as ball
handling and the quick transi-
tion, extremely well. Yet we
must keep working in every
area, I have pushed this team
harder than teams in the past,
but that is because I expect
more of this year’s squad.”’

Togetherness Stressed

by Dale Park

Washington and Lee basket-
ball wants to use “‘TTT’’ during
the 1980-81 season.

“TTT,” or “Total Team
Togetherness,’’ is the phrase
adopted by the 1980-81 Generals
as they seek their fourth Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
title and their fifth trip to the
NCAA South Atlantic Regional
Tournament.

“‘Last season we proved what
togetherness was all about, so
we adopted it for this season’s
phrase,”’ said head coach Verne
Canfield. Canfield is now in his
17th year as the Generals’ head
coach and has compiled a
256-151 career record at W&L.

In 1979-80 the Generals,
although posting a 14-15 season
record, won the ODAC Tourna-
ment played at Hampden-
Sydney. W&L stood fourth in the
copference regular season
standings with a 5-5 record. Yet
in the tournament the Generals
defeated Emory & Henry (56-50
quarterfinals), Eastern Men-
nonite (95-84 semifinals) and
Hampden-Sydney (58-56 finals)
for the crown.

The Generals’ sights are now
on 1980-81, which includes ex-
panded ODAC competition
(eight teams are now eligible
for the title) and ‘‘the hardest
first-half schedule we’ve had in
my years here,”’ said Canfield.

Three seniors, all returning
starters, make up the heart of
the 1980-81 squad.

One of these seniors, R.J.
Scaggs from Roanoke, Va., is,
according to Canfield, ‘‘the best
defensive player I’ve coached
in my 23 years.”’ Scaggs will
replace graduated forward
Tom Jeffries, giving the team,
as Canfield commented, ‘‘more
consistent speed at forward.”

At guard the Generals cun
count on senior co-captain Car-
by Hoy from Bryn Mawr, Penn-
sylvania. Hoy averaged 22.6
points in the first five games of
1979-80 before missing the rest
of the season.

At center is Rob Smitherman,
a Mt. Jackson, Va.,_ resi-
dent who averaged 11.1 points
and seven rebounds last year.
Canfield stated, ‘‘the team will
only do as well as our three
starting seniors do this season.
We are counting on experience
early in the season while our
depth continues to form.”’

Behind these seniors are
three upperclassmen who will
give W&L a ‘“‘six-man starting
line-up”’ according to Canfield.
“It’s the first time in a long
time that we’ve had true scor-
ing threats at each position.”’

Juniors George Spears and
Clark New, and sophomore
Brian Hansen are the other
starters. Spears, from Annan-
dale, Va., averaged 10.4 points
as a point guard last season;
New, from Alexandria, Va.,
averaged 8.5 points as a sixth-
man who played in all 29 games
last season; Hansen, a Rock-
ville, Md., resident, averaged

9.7 points and 4.6 rebounds last
season as one of W&L’'s few
freshmen starters during Can-
field’s career.

Supporting these six players
is a group of eight reserves,
which includes juniors Craig
Dye (Buchanan, Va.), and Ken
Jaffe (Wellingford, Pa.); soph-
omores Frank Eppes (Green-
ville, S.C.), and Jary Fechtel
(Leesburg, Fla.), and Mark
Shaver (Quentin, Pa.); and
freshmen Bill Yates (Vienna,
Va.), Henry Bond (Gloucester,
Va.), and John Graves (Nor-
folk, Va.). Eppes is the lone
returning letterman in the
group.

“The team has an edge on
other teams in conditioning and
preparation,” Canfield noted.
“This is a credit to the players.
We looked better at our first
pre-season ~~ scrimmage, after
just three days of practice, than
we did after six weeks of prac-
tice last year.”’

Antebellum Residence Will House

A pre-Civil War former facul-
ty residence at Washington &
Lee University, situated at the
north edge of the Colonnade, a
historical landmark, will be
restored as a research and ex-
hibition center for the universi-
ty’s historic art collections.

The project, a_ faithful
restoration of the mid-19th cen-
tury design, will be undertaken
utilizing two anonymous dona-
tions totaling $500,000 that were
given strictly for this purpose.

Included will be the addition
of a smaller new wing at the
back of the house, which was
built between 1842 and 1845. The
restoration plans were approv-
ed Nov. 1 by the Washington &
Lee board of trustees at its
regular autumn meeting on
campus. The work will begin
next spring and is expected to
be completed in less than a
year.

The restored facility will
house W&L’s Reeves Collection
of 18th and early 19th century
Chinese export porcelain, which
has acquired worldwide
recognition in the past decade
as one of the most extensive
private study collections of its
kind.

Also housed in the center will
be the avant-garde paintings by

   
   

the turn-of-the-century artist
Louise Herreshoff. Those pain-
tings were discovered after her
death in 1967 and premiered
four years ago at the Corcoran
Gallery of Art in Washington.
Since then they have received
considerable attention
throughout the art world.

The center will be the first
‘“‘home”’ for the two major col-
lections. They have been widely
shown throughout the United
States and, in the case of the
Reeves porcelain, interna-
tionally. W&L currently has no
facility sufficient to house the
collections or to allow either
research or permanent public
display.

Facilities will also be provid-
ed for the first time for
Washington & Lee students to
study both collections. Students
have become increasingly in-
terested in both the Reeves and
Herreshoff collections as they
have achieved prominence in
recent years.

Various parts of the restored
house will accomodate seminar
rooms, a_ research library,
study areas, workrooms, and
specialized display rooms for
china porcelain intended for ex-
port to the Colonies and later
the United States, as well as

other ceramics which were part
of theoriginal Reeves Collection
or added by subsequent gift, in-
cluding porcelain made_ in
England, Germany, France,
and elsewhere on the Continent.

The addition to the building,
which will rise just eight feet
above ground level, will house
the nearly 100 Herreshoff pain-
tings and will also be used for
special exhibitions of other
works from W&L’s art collec-
tions.

The house was one of four
constructed in the 1840’s flank-
ing both sides of the Colonnade.
It was originally occupied by a
teacher of mathematics, the
Rev. Dr. Philo Calhoun, who
also paid $3,500 for it. The other
campus houses were similarly
financed, and the college
gradually bought them back
from the professors.

The restoration announced
this week is the second of four.
The largest of the four
antebellum residences, the Lee-
Jackson House, was restored in
1976-77 primarily through
another anonymous gift from a
different donor.

Student interest in the Reeves
Collection traces to discoveries
of Chinese export porcelain at
the nearby ruins of Liberty Hall
Academy, W&L’s 18th-century
predecessor, according to
James W. Whitehead, curator
of historic art at Washington &
Lee as well as secretary to the
Board of Trustees.

The archaeological excava-
tion at Liberty Hall and subse-
quent analysis of historical and
scientific data have been under-
way since 1974 under the super-
vision of Dr. John M. McDaniel,
an associate anthrolpolgy pro-
fessor at W&L as well as profes-
sional archeologist.

During the course of the
“dig,’”’ W&L researchers have
uncovered more than 4,400
ceramic artifacts, almost all of
which were imported, many of
which exactly matched items in

the Reeves collection.

Fraternity Reacts To Punishment

social probation requirements.

Briscoe agreed with Hark-
rader that the rule creates a
“precarious situation”’ and add-
ed that the Student Affairs Com-
mittee rejected the IFC’s at-
tempt to amend the rule last
spring. “The SAC felt that this
one clause is really what gave it
(social probation) its weight, he
said.

Senior Justice Chip Nunley
said the SAC members sug-
gested to him that affected
students could circumvent the
rule by borrowing the apart-
ments of upperclassmen.

Harkrader said he _ is
frustrated by his attempts to
discuss a rule change with
faculty members which he

believes is ‘“‘unjust’’. “I talked
to them seriously, but they see
us as kids and they’re parents.”

Harkrader is bothered by
another aspect of his perception
of the SAC’s intended objectives
of social probation as a punish-
ment for fraternities. On the
subject of not allowing women
in fraternity houses during
social probation period, Hark-
rader questioned whether “‘this
is the only way SAC conceives
of women, as entertainment, or
maybe they just see it as a good
punishment.”

Harkrader added that he
thinks the IFC has done its part
to correct any inequity in the re-
quirements of social probation,
but that the SAC has admitted

the rule is unfair but rejected
Student attempts to change it
and refused to suggest any
alternatives it might accept.

The Pi Phi President explain-
ed that he does not believe the
incident was part of a plot to
discredit by their chapter’s na-
tional organization.

Harkrader added that any at-
tempt to ‘‘set us up was Mike
Willis’ (Pi Kappa Phi National
Secretary) and not that of the
national organization.”’

Another representitive of the
fraternity’s nationaL national
organization has since visited
the chapter and advised Willis
not to initiate any legal action
against the Washington and Lee
chapter.

Automatic Rule Committee

To Meet Wednesday

The Committee on the Auto-
matic Rule will meet at 10:30 on
Wednesday, December 24, 1980
to consider the academic
records of those students who
have fallen under the
Automatic Rule:

1. Students who failed to meet
the conditions of Academic Pro-
bation required of them at the
end of the current Fall Term;

2. Students completing a full
academic year who failed to
meet the cumulative average
required of their class.

The Committee will consider
for immediate reinstatement
all students who fall under the
Automatic Rule. If any student
wishes to inform the Committee
of extenuating circumstances,
he may write a letter to the
Committee and deliver it to the
Office of the Dean of the College
before the Committee meets.

In general, the Committee
grants few immediate rein-
statements. A student who falls
under the Automatic Rule has
severed his connection with the
University. If the Committee
does not grant him immediate
reinstatement, he is not eligible
for reinstatement until after the
passage of at least one calendar
year,

As soon as possible after the
Committee’s meeting, each stu-
dent falling under the Auto-
matic Rule will receive a letter
explaining his status.

ACADEMIC PROBATION

Any student not subject to the
Automatic Rule in December
who fails to achieve the cumu-
lative average required of him
at the end of Fall Term, 1980
(see page 61 in Catalogue),

places himself on Academic
Probation for Winter Term,
1981.

Outing Club
Hikes In
Blue Ridge
Mountains

by Charles Atkinson

The W&L outing club took a
sojourn into the Blue Ridge
Mountains. The expedition con-
sisted of a two day trip with
Randolph-Macon and Sweet-
briar along a section of the Ap-
palachian trail between The
Blue Ridge Parkway and Route
501. On Friday evening, the
group hiked two and a half
miles to a shelter and spent the
night.

On Saturday, the group
climbed to the top of the ridge
and followed it to the summit of
Bluff Mt., then went down to the
Parkway. On the whole, it was a
fairly demanding hike, and the
group set a good pace. It only
rained twice during the hike on
Saturday, but the rain came as
a relief rather than a hindrance.

Though it was misty and
visibility was limited, the sur-
rounding mountains were visi-
ble, and the mist gave them an
eerie appearance. The hike on
Saturday was about eight miles
long, and the group arrived at
the pick-up point by four
o'clock.

WLUR

(continued from page 1)

Another time a DJ inadvertent-
ly aired a song containing
obscene words during the even-
ing opera broadcast.

“We had 15 calls in five
minutes,” de Maria said.

Yet de Maria credits listeners
with having patience and
understanding with on-the-job
training of students.

“Listeners are willing to put
up with the lack of professional-
ism because we have so much to
offer,”’ he said.

WLUR is financed each year
with about $10,000 of the univer-
sity’s money and is staffed by
students. The station was
granted its license in 1967 by the
Federal Communication Com-
mission as an_ alternative
community-oriented station
serving W&L, Lexington and
Rockbridge County. And
according to de Maria, the
primary function of station pro-
gramming is to serve aS a
public service station.

“We try to accommodate
everybody at least once during
the day whether it’s news and
public affairs or music,” said
de Maria. ‘We offer listeners a
cross-section of musical

forms.” As a result, it is possi-

     
   
    
      

eo
a

Alvin-Bennis

ble to hear music ranging from
classics and opera to jazz and
rock-and-roll, all between 7
a.m. and 2a.m.

The FCC requires that WLUR
conduct a yearly community
ascertainment survey to insure
that the station serves the
public interests. Done by
students in one of de Maria’s
journalism classes, the survey
attempts to determine what
problems of community inter-
est exist in Lexington. After do-
ing interviews with religious
and civic leaders as well as
public officials and residents,
de Maria said it is then possible
for the station to broadcast pro-
grams dealing with local public
affairs.

“The FCC wants us, and all
stations, to help in answering
the problems of the communi-
ty,”’ de Maria said.

Considering all the factors
which comprise WLUR, it’s pos-
sible to understand why de
Maria often feels like he is in
charge of the local women’s
shoe store. It is not enough to
stick with one kind of program-
ming, according to de Maria,
and thus, many different people
with numerous varying opin-
ions listen to the station.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Liddy

G. Gordon Liddy—Watergate Conspirator, former ~

Nixon aide, the man who wanted to kill columnist
Jack Anderson and fellow White House plumber
Howard Hunt. He is also the man who will speak to
members of the Washington and Lee community
Monday night as Contact’s fourth speaker of the year.
Unlike other contact presentations this year, Liddy’s
speech will probably be well attended. Liddy has pro-
ven to be a big draw at colleges and universities na-
tionwide. Regardless of your personal feelings toward
this man, his role in our recent political history com-
mands our interest if not our respect. We think all
members of the student body owe it to themselves to
go and listen to what Liddy has to say. One can
understand student apathy toward Contact consider-
ing the weak lineup of speakers earlier this year, but
no speaker this year is as fascinating as Liddy. Also,
none so far have demanded the fee which Liddy
requires—and you are paying for Liddy to speak.

We strongly urge you to see Mr. Liddy. It’s your
time—and it’s your money.

Crime Prevention

After reading our front page story of how a
Washington and Lee student went out and recovered
his stolen proerty, one has to wonder about the police
department in Lexington. We certainly don’t think
students should go out and take the law into their own
hands, we think maybe it would be a better job for the
police department. Perhaps it would be good for one
or two officers to patrol the streets on foot.

The university could help matters some by tighten-
ing security in the dormitories. Many students have
had property stolen out of locked rooms because
theives have pass keys. President Huntley says it is
too expensive to replace all the locks in the dorms, but
maybe new locks could be placed on the buildings’ en-
trance doors with students having a key to that door.

We cannot say we know much about law enforce-
ment or crime, but we can see it and we do think that
Lexington continues to have a crime problem which
the police department seems incapable cf dealing
with. We just hope it doesn’t come to the point where
students have to go out to protect their property
because no one else will.

To the Editor
Sir:

Good for you. You have
restored my faith in the system.
I am referring to your editorial
in the 20 November RTP. I was
among those who were enraged
over the last sentence in the
previous week’s editorial.

It takes a good man to admit
his error. I congratulate you for
your action. Well done.

Dear Editor:

I’m a freshman here at
Washington and Lee from New
Jersey, so maybe I’m _ not
familiar with the way some
things are done here in
Virginia, but I think I was the
victim of severely unethical and
cruel business practices last
Saturday when I returned from
the Thanksgiving break. I refer
specifically to the actions of
College Taxi Service of Lex-
ington.

I returned to Lexington about
8:00 p.m. Saturday evening ona
bus from Roanoke. Another
man that got off the same bus
called for two taxicabs, one for
him and one for me. Neither
showed up after about ten

I went over to the Lexington
Motel with my two suitcases, a
gym bag, and a pair of boots.
The woman behind the desk was
kind enough to call the College
Taxi Service and ask that a cab
be sent to the Lexington Motel.
She was told it would be there in
twenty minutes. I waited ap-
proximately forty minutes, and
when no taxi arrived, I called
the College Taxi Service twice,
and both times I was hung-up
on. I started to walk back to
W&L with my heavy luggage,
and luckily I was befriended by
the kind manager of the Royal
Hosts Inn, to whom I am deeply
grateful for giving mea ride the
rest of the way.

Not only has the College Taxi
Service lost a valuble customer
(as I don’t have a car of my own
down here yet with which to get
back and forth to the bus sta-
tion), but I think it was cruel to
let someone wait for a taxi when
other arrangements could have
been made. I would think the
College Taxi Service would try
to so elicit business, instead of
biting the hand that feeds it.
Washington and Lee and VMI
are the life-blood of this town,
and if the College Taxi Service
does not wish to acknowledge
that fact, maybe they would not
like to remain in business very
long.

Sincerely,
Scott John Fitzgerald

 
From The Editors

The Pi Kappa Phi reaction to their punishment raises once again
several questions about social probation as a. punitive measure,
and right of the Student Affairs Committee and the Interfraternity
Council’s to regulate the personal lives and rights of individual
fraternity members.

The IFC and SAC can bar women from entering fraternity houses
during periods of social probation. Aside from the discriminatory
restrictions such an action places upon the personal relationships
of fraternity sophomores and presidents — we’ll assume all frater-
nity members have knowingly agreed. to accept the risks
associated with social probation when they join a fraternity; one
cannot help but question the authority and right of any University
committee to prescribe such a punishment.

Several fraternities have offered social affiliation to women in
the past, referred to as “‘little sisters,’’ these women are usually
dues paying members with rights of access to Washington and Lee
fraternities; how would the IFC deal with them? Several women
study here at W&L through an exchange program with neighboring
colleges — should these students be denied entry into fraternity
houses while other male students are not? Does Washington and
Lee really want to tangle with the American Civil Liberties Union?

The IFC has also granted itself the right to prohibit members of
fraternities on social probation from gathering in groups larger
than five. Can the University, much less the IFC, really prohibit the
meeting of adult students in a public place or in a non-fraternity
situation? What if more than five affected fraternity members
reside together in an off-campus apartment or country home.

The IFC recently completed perhaps the most restrictive and
regulated fraternity rush in W&L history. Specifically, the ‘‘no con-
tact” provisions of fraternity rush represent very real infr-
ingements upon the personal rights of fraternity members. Can the
IFC really tell students who they can talk to, about what subject
and-when or where such a conversation can take place? A case can
be made that a fraternity member accepts these constraints when
he accepts membership in one of W&L’s social fraternities;
however, the widespread participation by students in fraternities
only underscores the question of whether any group has the right to
regulate the social behavior of other U.S. citizens in seeming viola-
tion of their ‘inalienable rights.”

We do not pretend to know how the University and the IFC should
deal with the inconsistencies and loopholes assiciated with its
policies, but we are certain these questions require attention, con-
sideration and eventual reform.

Student self-government appears to survive at
Washington and Lee, even though it often
stumbles, falls, and perishes at other colleges and
universities. The Ring-tum Phi generally supports
student self-government, particularly the way it is
practiced at Washington and Lee. We understand
that in some cases a certain degree of secrecy is

Editor’s Note

/

necessary. However, we also think and believe
that this secrecy can cause problems, such as the
one brought out in the article below. Unlike
students brought up on honor charges, students
brought before the student Control Committee can
not appeal their case to the student body. Cases
with two or more dissenting votes are reviewed by
the student Affairs Committee.

 

 

An Analvsis

Student

Control

And Discipline At W&L

by Tom Baker

At a Student Control Committee meeting early
this fall,.a senior was punished with one year of
conduct probation for assaulting another student
atafraternity party. -

Two weeks before that the SCC gave a freshman
who had a small amount of marijuana in his room
a week of dormitory probation, two weeks social
probation and a year of conduct probation.

The senior hit a freshman, knocking him down
and giving him a bloody nose. The senior’s punish-
ment consists of a warning that if, within a year’s
time he is guilty of another act of misconduct, his
next punishment will be more severe than the par-
ticular act may justify.

For having a small amount of a controlled
substance in his room, the freshman was not
allowed in the dormitories except between the
hours of 12 midnight and 8:00 a.m. for a week that
included midterm exams, was not allowed to par-
ticipate in-any University or fraternity sponsored
activities for two weeks and was given the same
warning as the senior.

“Fair but firm’’ were the words used by Jim
Averett, chairman of the Student Control Commit-
tee, to describe the goal of the committee when it
disciplines a student.

Averett — who has offered to take complete
responsibility for all decisions made by the SCC
—said that each case that brought before the com-
mittee is looked at separately and that any incon-
sistencies that might result-from the sentencing
process are as a result of the different facts of
each case and the individuals that make up the
committee. Averett said it is a diverse committee
in which every member has a say in what goes on.
Also, according to Averett, there are no prece-
dents set in any of these cases and there is no cer-
tain punishment for a certain offense.

Averett did make clear, though, that the student

ae

IVE

WHILE, ER, TO SEE ABOUT
DROP-APD SLIP MAY

who had the marijuana was dealt with forcefully
in order to impress upon the freshmen class that
the use of marijuana in the dorms is prohibited, in
part, because it can lead to raids by the police.

The two victims in these cases had differing
views as to the fairness of the punishments handed
out. \

The freshman who was knocked down, at first
angered by the fact that the senior who hit him
just received a year of conduct probation, later
felt that the punishment was correct.

The freshman with the marijuana felt that his
privacy was invaded when a dormitory counselor,
looking at a lacrosse stick, found the marijuana
and reported it to the SCC. He felt that his punish-
ment was unjustifiably severe when con-
sidering the punishments for cases that involved
marijuana in past years.

But, according to a senior who was on the Com-
mittee during his sophomore and junior years, a
person can not consider the actions of past com-
mittees because the make-up of the committee is
different each year.

The basic philosophy of the committee changes
each year because the membership, made up
mostly of class presidents and vice presidents,
changes every year.

This senior also brought up the fact that any per-
son who feels he has been treated unfairly has
always had the right to appeal his case and there-
by bring it before the Student Affairs Committee.

This senior also pointed out the move by Student
Control in the past few years toward punishments
that were more ‘“‘suited”’ to the individual as well
as the offense.

A fine for a wealthy student or social probation
for a non-fraternity member did not mean much
so the committee tried to give a punishment that

 

would suit the situation more appropriately. 4
