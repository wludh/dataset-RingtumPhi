Grant Received For

udio-Visual Center

A grant of $120,000 from the
funds of The Pew Memorial
Trust of Philadelphia, Pa., has
been made to Washington and
Lee University to help fund an
audio-visual center for the
university’s new undergraduate
library.

Announcement of the grant
was made by Washington and
Lee president Robert E.R.
Huntley.

Once completed, the library’s
audio-visual center will include

a modern, multi-purpose
system that will be used
throughout the campus.

The university’s $9 million
library, formally dedicated last
May, contains a 1,500 square
foot area that was architec-
turally designed to become an
audio-visual center.

Preliminary plans call for a
small video system to be
located in the center, providing
video materials to four seminar
rooms and two. conference

rooms located in the library and
equipped with video monitors.

In announcing the Pew
Memorial Trust grant, Huntley
noted that “the systematic
development of our audio-visual
capabilities has been a growing
need in recent years. This
assistance from the Pew
Memorial Trust will have a far-
reaching and gratifying effect
on many academic programs
where teaching effectiveness
can be enhanced by modern
technology andresources.”” —

The Pew Memorial Trust is
the second largest foundation in
the United States in size of
assets. It was set up by Joseph
N. Pew Jr., J. Howard Pew,
Mary Ethel Pew, and Mabel
Pew Myrin in memory of their
father and mother.

The $120,000 grant helps to
make possible one of the
specific needs in the universi-
ty’s $62 million development
program toward which $56
million has already been com-
mitted.

 

EC Assessment By Cope Moyers

Progress Made
Through Diligence

Future Executive Commit-
tees should take a hard look at
the efforts of Bob Willis & Co.
There is much to learn from the
outstanding if not sometimes
unusual job this year’s Ex-
ecutive Committee did.

It is indeed possible to come
to gripswith a complex and
crucial university matter, as
the EC demonstrated with its
handling of the White Book revi-
sions. Undoubtedly, the new
changes and clarifications im-
plemented by the EC have
strengthened the university’s
most important set of rules.
Next year’s committee should
remember this: nothing’s im-
possible.

But future Executive Com-
mittees should also remember
that as the year progresses, and
October. turns to May, it
becomes more difficult to
resolve important issues. Im-
portant matters, whenever
possible, must be handled and
resolved before the end of the
year.

Thus, when future EC’s
search for inspiration and in-
sight, they can remember that
this year’s committee rewrote
the White Book, even though at

times half its members were
absent. Indeed, the work got
done, but it was completed
without the benefit of input
from Jeff Edwards and Mike
Nogay, the two law represen-
tatives, and several of the
veteran members.

This years committee does
not claim as its sole achieve-
ment the rewriting of the White
Book. The committee is, accor-
ding to the Student Handbook,
“responsible. for the ad-
ministration of the Honor
System and also the supervision

of all campus activities.’’ And
that is exactly what the EC did.
Campus security was pro-
bably the one issue most of the
university community was con-
cerned with. Early in the year,
attacks on_ students’ by
townspeople occurred regular-
ly, as did thefts of students’ per-
sonal property. It was the Ex-
ecutive Committee which first
approached the problem,
discussing ways security might
be improved. Thanks to the
committee, the Lexington

White Ousted From SC

by Todd Smith
In an emotional, drawn-out
Wednesday night meeting, the
Executive Committee-elect
rescinded the appointment of
Bud White, Chairman of the
Student Control Committee.

Members of Student Control
challenged the White appoint-
ment claiming that their con-
stitution specifies that the
chairman come from the com-
mittee’s own ranks. White was
not elected to Student Control
for 81-82, although he had serv-
ed two years before.

The new Executive Commit-
tee closed the doors and decided
unanimously that they had the
right to name Student Control
Chairmen not elected to the
Committee. By consensus, the
new committeemen then
rescinded White’s appointment.

The EC-elect decided that it
was legally right but morally
wrong to have Student Control
chaired by a non-elected ap-
pointee.

The EC elect then selected
Barry Dunn as chairman, over
Peter Collins and other commit-

teemen. Collins, this year’s
freshman representative to Stu-
dent Control, had made a com-
plaint to the new EC after
White’s selection.

The Monday night meeting
was a measure of the new EC’s
performance capabilities. Of
the eight members at the
meeting, only three were retur-
ning representatives.

Barry Dunn explained during
the meeting, ‘‘These ten guys
can work with Bud. I like him.
But who is to say that future
EC’s may put in chairmen that
the students haven’t elected.”’

‘“‘We are here,’ stated an
emotional Collins, ‘‘because we
think it is not in the best in-
terests of the student body to
appoint a non-elected official.”’

“It is for us to decide what is
in the best interests of the
students,’’ retorted Secretary-
elect Bennett Ross.

Representative John
Vlahoplus advised Student Con-
trol to ignore the EC appoint-
ment and go to the faculty to
determine the extent of its
autonomy.

Four Receive

Mahan Awards

The English Department an-
nounced today the winners of
the Mahan Awards in Creative
Writing. Three awards of $150
each for prose entries from
sophomores, juniors, and
seniors were announced, and
one prize of $200 for a poetry en-
try from an undergraduate.

The winners in prose are Jack
Sharman, ’83, John A. Wells,
82, and Ben Keesee, ’81.
‘Whereas no single entry was
fully achieved,” in the opinion
of the judges, they wished to
recognize ‘‘the ambition and
promise’ of each of the prose
winners. No prize for freshmen
prose was awarded this year.

The verse award went to R.C.

Swagler, Jr., 84 for the “finely
compressed nature poems
“Bluff”? and, especially, ‘‘Pos-
ing.”’ In ‘Posing,’ the judges
said, ‘‘the Tetons come alive
through subtle shifts in rhythm
created by a physical sense of
pause and the weight of words.
Unexpected objects are quietly
brought into juxtaposition:
prairie dogs and blackbirds,
peanuts and children’s fingers.
In the last stanza, ‘a glacier
continues its unnoticed thaw/
and a_ buffalo shifts his
weight.’ ”’

The Mahan Awards were
established under the will of
George A. Mahan of Hannibal,
Missouri, a ‘‘Lee student’ who
died in 1936.

Sigma Nu Told |

 

To Clean Up. Act

by Tom Baker

Having failed a house inspec-
tion, missed payments on a
University loan and been the ob-
ject of numerous complaints,
the Sigma Nu social fraternity
is undergoing several changes
ordered by the Student Affairs
Committee to insure that the
fraternity meets basic universi-
ty requirements.

Several weeks ago the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee, the
organization which acts as the
final reviewing board for all
cases of fraternity misconduct,
met with Sigma Nu officers to
investigate the reports of finan-
cial negligence and complaints
of very poor house conditions
from alumni as well as others.

While the house officers did
admit to problems with the.
fraternity, they appeared to be
sincere, according to Professor
Robert J. de Maria, an SAC
member, in their efforts to cor-
rect the situation.

After a private meeting, the
SAC set up a series of measures
that would give Sigma Nu time
to get in physical and financial

order:

— No members will be allow-
ed to live or eat at the house un-
til significant repairs are made
on the house, but the fraternity
will be allowed to perform rush
functions in the house.

— The fraternity will be re-
quired to appoint a faculty ad-
viser as well as a scholarship of-
ficer.

— There will be an oversight
committee, composed of Dean

Murphy, associate dean of
students, the university
treasurer, Mr. Epley, two

representatives from Sigma Nu
natignal which is based in Lex-
ington, two members from
Sigma Nu fraternity corpora-
tion, and the fraternity faculty
adviser.

Dean Murphy stressed the
point that these were not
punitive measures but actions
taken to improve the chapter.
Prof. de Maria added that next
year will be the centennial an-
niversary of the chapter’s ex-
istence at W&L and that it
would be a ‘‘damn shame’”’ if
the fraternity didn’t make it.

Bogus Speed Hawked

by Robin Smithwick

When one first glances at the
headlines it seems incredible.
At the top of the page the bold
print reads ‘‘New Legal
Stimulants,”’ followed by a list
of 28 different types of prescrip-
tion amphetamines, commonly
called ‘‘speed.”’

Awestruck, one may ask
himself whether of not the Food
and Drug Administration has
taken a big turnaround and
legalized these potent pills. But
in actuality, the capsules are
only “‘look alikes,”’ imitations of

real speed.

Throughout the school year,
and particularly around exam

time, flyers advertising these
“look alikes” have been inun-

dating post office boxes of W&L
students.

The only “‘high’’ that can be
achieved from these brightly
colored pills is equivalent to
that of a strong cup of coffee.
They are simply high dosages of
caffeine or other mild
stimulants encased in
numbered capsules which are
supposed to simulate real am-
phetamines. They are effective
for a while, but they clearly do
not have the potency of real
speed.

The biggest tip-off that these
pills are not really what they
appear to be is their relative
low cost. One of these drug

Denny Awarded Rikkyo

International Scholarship

Stephen H. Denny, a
Washington and Lee University
sophomore from Bethesda,
Md., has received a Rikkyo
University International
Scholarship for study at the
Tokyo, Japan, university dur-
ing the 1981-82 school year.

Denny becomes the second
W&L student to receive a
scholarship under the new pro-
gram instituted by Rikkyo
University, which has an ex-
change agreement with four
American institutions — W&L,
the University of Chicago, the
University of the South, and
Kenyon College.

George Bartlett Peaslee, a
1980 graduate of Washington
and Lee, is currently studying

Students, Faculty Present

at Rikkyo under the same

scholarship program.
Denny, who plans to major in
East Asian Studies at

Washington and Lee, will work
with the Japanese faculty at
Rikkyo in the areas of business
and economics.

Rikkyo was founded in 1874 by
a Virginia missionary. It is
widely recognized as one of
Japan’s top-ranking private in-
stitutions.

James Takashi Yashiro, pro-
fessor of Christian studies at
Rikkyo, has spent the past
academic year at Washington
and Lee as the Philip Howerton
Scholar-in-Residence. He will

Serve as Denny’s adviser at
Rikkyo.

‘“‘dealers,’’ the Shehan-
Distributing Co. of Lewistown,
Pa., sells the pills in bottles of
1000 for only $25.

The most common “look
alikes” being sold at W&L are
imitation ‘“‘black beauties,”
which are usually sold for $1 a
“hit,” but can be purchased
here for as low as 30¢a pill.

While these pills do not have
the potency of amphetamines,
they. are a bargain when com-
pared to their commercial
equivalents. No-Doz and
Vivarin, two popular over-the-
counter stimulants, sell for
$4.21 and $3.64 a bottle respec-
tively at Super X in Lexington.

As exam time approaches
once again, the sale of these
‘look alikes” will probably in-
crease. But much of the effects
of these capsules are only
psychological because they are
clearly not the amphetamines
which they are supposed to im-
itate. If one feels he needs
something extra for a long night
of cramming, he can probably
get the same effect from a few
cups of Co-op coffee.

comparative history of religion
at Harvard University.

‘“Monumenta Nipponica”’ is
one of the two leading English
language journals devoted to
Japanese cultural studies.

Rogers, a B.S. graduate of
Virginia Military Institute who
also holds the bachelor of divini-
ty degree from Virginia

Named for the late Dr. J.
Shelton Horsley, a nationally
prominent surgeon who was the
academy’s fourth president, the
award is determined by a panel
of scientists from a state other
than Virginia.

Since the early 1960s, Jarrard
has been conducting research
into a small portion of the brain
called the hippocampus. His
award-winning paper examined
the relationship between
damage of that part of the brain
and behavior in _ laboratory
animals.

It was the second time this
year that Jarrard’s research
has been selected for an award.
Earlier, the Virginia Psycho-
logical Association presented
its award for Outstanding Con-
tribution to Psychology as a
Science to Jarrard.

Jarrard began his research
into the Hippocampus during
his first stint as a teacher at
Washington and Lee in the early
1960s. After leaving W&L in 1966
to teach at Carnegie-Mellon
University, Jarrard returned to
Washington and Lee in 1971 as
head of the psychology depart-
ment.

A native of Waco, Texas, Jar-
rard received the A.B. degree
from Baylor University and
holds both his M.S. and Ph.D.
degrees from Carnegie-Mellon.

Review:

 

 

 

by M. Shaw Pyle

Hi. Remember me? Yes,
that’s right; it is I, the New
Right Kritik. And it’s time for
another installment in the ongo-
ing struggle between your hum-
ble critic and the Ariel. So, here
goes, as I take up arms for
Truth, Justice, and the
American Way.

You may recall that I had cer-
tain criticisms, not of the fall
Ariel alone, but of the entire
school of writing it belonged to.
I will not repeat those cavils
here; suffice it to say that there
is some improvement in the spr-
ing issue. However, the im-
provement is not uniform, nor is
it anywhere near enough.

It is unfortunate that the Ariel
was not intended to be a sort of
Bartlett’s chock full of new
material, waiting to be borrow-
ed; the volume contains some
great lines. But great lines do
not necessarily form a great
issue, and the new Ariel has

some beautiful moments but
some godawful quarter hours.

The decent quarter hours are

The Men On The Ariel Trapeze

provided by Jake Jones and
Ned MacDonald, whose stories
really deserve the old term
‘finely chiseled.’ Jones’ Silent,

Sing the Steel Chords is possibly
his best work to date; certainly
it is one of the better stories I’ve
read lately. And MacDonald’s
Runnin’ from the Sixties is simp-
ly a must-read.

As for the also-rans, stories
that would have been the best in
the issue if the two discussed
above weren’t around, there are
Russell Clarke’s untitled hun-
ting tale and The Dance, the lat-
ter written in collaboration with
Ron Dionne. Too, there is Jones’
poem The Eye is Calm, two
poems by Rick Swagler, two
more by Lawrence Norford,
and one by David Collins.

To be specific, the flaws in
each of the above are minor or
nonexistent. The poetry re-
quires a good deal of careful at-
tention, but, with the exception
of Swagler’s work, is worth it.

 

French ‘New Wave’

Fi m To Be Shown

by Carren O. Kaston

The last movie this year is the
English Department’s foreign-
film-course series is Jacques
Rivette’s madcap comedy, the
magical Celine and Julie Go
Boating (France, 1974). It will
be screened Tuesday, May 26,
in Reid Hall 203, at one time
only — 7 p.m. The showing is
free of charge and open to the
public.

Rivette is one of a group of '

important French film critics
who turned to directing in the
late 50’s and early 60’s, and,
through their theories and prac-
tice, founded the ‘French New
Wave.”’ Many New-Wave
assumptions still dominate
movie-making as we know it
now. Besides Rivette, this
group of critic-directors in-
cludes, notably, Francois Truf-
faut, Eric Rohmer, Jean-Luc
Godard, and Alain Resnais.
Truffaut has been represented
in our series by Love on the Run
and The Man Who Loved
Women, and Rohmer by the
recently shown Claire’s Knee.
The puzzle-like Celine and
Julie is constructed around a
proliferating series of doubl-

ings, and enacts Rivette’s
predilection for ‘‘endless
stories, on the lines of an Ara-
bian Nights—or soap opera.”
Although it is virtually impossi-
ble to decide whether anything
in the movie “really’’ takes
place, the plot seems to concern
two young women who visit a
haunted house in which the
same melodrama is_ being
endlessly replayed. Each time,
they come away with a sweet in
their mouths that enables them
to relive the story. Eventually,
they go to the house together
and try to avert the conclusion
of the tale, the killing of a child.
Not until the end of the movie do
they ‘‘go boating.”’

The movie shows debts to
Hitchcock and Renoir, among
other directors, and to Lewis
Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland.

Next year’s season will open
on October 16 and 17 with
Bertrand Bliers comedy Get
Out Your Handkerchiefs
(France/Belgium), which was
selected as the best foreign film
of 1978. Our second movie will
be Reinhard Hauff’s superb
psychological thriller, Knife in
the Head (Germany, 1978),
scheduled for November 6 and
ti

 

This is not meant to denigrate
Rick’s poetry, either, so just
hold off on the letter to the
editor accusing me of fascism
or similar criminality. It is
simply that it is difficult to ex-
trapolate Swagler’s vignettes
into anything really enlighten-

ing. One should be able to con-

zntertainment

struct whole philosophies out of
a poem; in these works, we are
led to nothing new or striking.
This is the problem, to a lesser
degree, with the other poetry,
but the other works do come a
little closer to the mark, and at
least they find a fresh way of
stating the axioms.

As far as the rest of the issue
goes, The Dance fails in the final
analysis because of the authors’
apparent inability to univer-
salize the experience recounted

in the story. Friends of mine
(yes, I do have a few) from

Long Island assure me that the
piece is very significant... to
them. The fact that it is not
prima facie significant to me

argues that is not fully realised
aS an veuvre.

The work of Lawrence Davis
and Tom Southall is a succes-
sion of beautiful moments that

never quite form a time. The
similes and metaphors both

employ are remarkable, but I
can discern no_ structure
beneath. They’re just there: ic-
ing and no cake. Believe me, it
gets old.

This lack of core — a lack I

lamented at length in the fall
—is the rift in several lutes:
particularly those of Jude Mar-
tin and Phillip Welch; it and a
certain puerility of tone (if in-
tentional, overplayed; if ac-
cidental, painful) make Andrew
Trotter’s music mute as well. In
terms of the text, I’ve saved the
best for last: there is an untitled
poem, like a sudden spring in
a parched land, that could be
overlooked, but mustn’t be: it’s

Last Friday night, the Ap-
palachian Dance and Music
Ensemble performed a variety
of pieces on the stage at Lex-
ington High School.

The company is based in West
Virginia and _ performs
throughout Kentucky, and has
gained quite a reputation west
of the Blue Ridge range. The
company is supported by grants
from the Federal government,
private endowments, and the
West Virginia Council on the
Arts.

Included in their vast reper-
toire is the poetry of West
Virginia’s State Poet Laureate,
Dr. Louise McNeil Pease. They
have taken from Dr. Pease’s
book, The Elderberry Flood,
several poems representative
of Appalachia and produced
various choreographic, lyrical,
and instrumental interpreta-
tions.

The company is surprisingly
small — five dancers and four
musicians — nine in all. The ar-
tistic dance director Toreta
Manning is the principle
choreographer and is a heavy
set, tremendously talented
dancer. The other dancers, Bar-
bara Hopkins, Deborah and

 

Jennifer Donaldson (sisters),

The Appalachian

Dance Review:

Dance Ensemble

and Charles Baker are equally
talented. The musical director
John Yurick plays piano,
guitar, mandolin, and banjo and
also does the arranging and
composing. For the _perfor-
mances, Dan Manning,
Toreta’s husband, does the in-
troductions and plays guitar,
mandolin, auto harp, and an ex-
cellent penny whistle. The other
two musicians are Alan Martin

on bass and electric bass and’

Dan Bailey playing a highly
skilled classical guitar. Dan
Manning also does the singing
for all the lyrical pieces.

The name of the company,
Appalachian Dance and Music
Ensemble, is misleading, as
was demonstrated readily dur-
ing the university sponsored
performance. Although they
understandably have a wide
range of Appalachia-linked

pieces, they displayed a
tremendous’ versatility
throughout the show.

The first piece, ‘“‘SH Bheag,
SH’Mho’r,” was in a classical
ballet style set to a traditional
Irish Highlands tune. The
dancers portrayed maidens in
the meadows collecting flowers.
In this piece, Ms. Manning’s
choreography was particularly
well suited for Jennifer

Donaldson as she demonstrated
a lightning quickness in move;
ment and a_ seeming ef-
fortlessness.

The last number in Act I was
titled ‘‘Jubilee.’”’ Performed to
the taped music of Spyro Gyra,
this was a jazz number danced
by all the Dance Ensemble.
Previously, in SH’ Bheag, SH’
Mho’r Charles Baker seemed
stiff in the rigidly classical
Style, but to the ‘‘dancing
music’”’ of Spyro Gyra, Mr.
Baker was completely at home
with the jazz rythyms and
seemed to enjoy it much more.

The Ensemble as a whole put
on a fine presentation with no
visible rough spots in spite of
the adverse conditions. The
stage floor was hard to work
with and the company had very
little time to adjust as most of
them arrived less than two
hours before the performance,
leaving even less time to set up
and then practice or warm up.
But, even under the cir-
cumstances, the performers
are true professionals and
presented a fine production.
This was their first perfor-
mance here, but I hope that
after such a successful debut I
will have the opportunity to see
them more than once next year.

What can one say about a play
that ends in death, destruction,
and the remains of heavily
chewed scenery and yet fails to
offend, sorrow, or depress
anybody? A play with only
friendly violence, no sexual ex-
plicitry, and a total absence of
psychoanalytic this, that, and
the other? I mean, it simply
isn’t modern.

No, thank God, but it sure can
be fun. This is the appropriate
vehicle for scene-chewing, gun-
toting melodramatics. No
highbrow stuff here, no
demands on the audience to
analyze the leading man’s
dreams. In other words, it’s a
good time, and a whole lot of fun
in an amateur-night-in-Dixie

sort of way. The critic had a
blast (after he calmed
down...being deliberately in-
sulted by the cast and crew on
the way into the theatre is hard-
ly the foot off which one wishes
to start).

The play is a great deal like
parts of the Mississippi: it is
broad and by no means deep. If
one wants social commentary,
this is not the play one seeks.
(Historically, it’s tripe-and trite
tripe, too). But the latitude in
the play allows for any amount
of missed cues, muffed lines,
and garbled singin’ and hoofin’
— which was just as well on
opening night. But for what it is
— a romp — it went well
enough. The cast was adequate
and often better (and hammier)
than merely adequate; the sets,
costumes, and sundries rather
better than usual. It ain’t The
Wild Duck, but it’s by no means
a waste of time. Take the kids,
if you’ve got any. There is a

that Chris Flaesch will try to

Lovell And Gaker
Take Second

by Dale Park

Washington and Lee seniors
Pete Lovell and Doug Gaker
upheld the University’s reputa-
tion as a small-college tennis
power this past week when they
earned All-America honors in
doubles’ competition at the
sixth annual NCAA Division III
Championships, held Wednes-
day through Saturday, May
13-16, at Salisbury State College
in Maryland.

Lovell, from Bedford, N.H.,
and Gaker, from Middleton,
Ohio, finished second in a field
of 32 doubles entries to earn the
award and mark the fifth con-
secutive year a W&L entry has
claimed an All-America laurel.
Their performance marks the
third time W&L_ has
represented the doubles’ finals
at the NCAA event, the first
time coming in 1977 when Ben
Johns and Stewart Jackson won
the title, the second in 1978 when
Johns and Jackson finished se-
cond.

Lovell and Gaker began their
march to the finals by winning
their first-round match on
Wednesday and their second-
round contest on Thursday to
advance to quarterfinal action
on Friday. There they won 6-4,
6-3 over Rod Dowdle and Ben
Sheehy from Swarthmore (Pa. )
College to earn a berth in that
same afternoon’s semifinal
round, where they triumphed
5-7, 6-4, 6-1 over Rico Silveira
and Bill Harper from Millsaps

(Miss.) College. In Saturday’s
title match, Lovell and Gaker
bowed to Jim Hern and Shaun
Miller from Gustavus-Adolphus

(Minn. ) College, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5.

Their four doubles wins,
coupled with each one’s
opening-round singles’ win on

Wednesday, gave W&L six

points and a sixth-place finish in

the team standings. Swarth-
more and Claremont-Mudd

(Calif.) College collected nine

points each to tie for first;

Bates (Maine) College,

Kalamazoo (Mich.), and

Gustavus-Adolphus compiled

seven points each to deadlock

for second.
The All-America honor is

Gaker’s first and Lovell’s se-

cond, the first coming at the
1980 NCAA Championships
when he and_ then-senior
Stewart Jackson reached the
semifinals in doubles competi-
tion before bowing out. Gaker
had participated in the 1978,
1979, and 1980 NCAA events.
Their 4-1 record in the cham-
pionships gave them an 18-14
mark in overall doubles’ play
this spring.

Lovell and Gaker will now
compete in the 97th Annual
NCAA Division I Champion-
ships, held May 16-24 at the
University of Georgia in
Athens, Georgia. Every year
the champion and runner-up in
both Division III singles and
doubles are invited to compete
in the Division I event.

In what was the final game of
the season, the Washington and
Lee lacrosse team came out on
the short end of a 12-11 sudden
death overtime decision to the
University. of Maryland-
Baltimore.

‘We got off to a slow start,”
remarked W&L coach Jack
Emmer as the UMBC
Retrievers literally shelled the
Generals by scoring four goals
in the first four minutes of play.
The Generals, however, came
roaring back to tie the score at
5-5 at the midway point of the
game.

The second half saw a neck
and neck battle with neither
team ever maintaining more
than a two goal advantage.
Largely due to the play of the
W&L defense, the Generals
were able to keep pace with the
number 9 ranked Retrievers.
W&L goalie Ware Palmer turn-
ed in a particularly impressive
performance with 17 saves on
the day to keep the game tight.

With the score even at eleven
goals a piece at the end of
regulation time, the Generals
took immediate possession of
the ball on the face off at the
start of the overtime period.
W&L failed to connect,
however, and at just one minute
and three seconds into the over-
time, UMBC fired home the

game winning goal.

Despite the outcome of the
game, the Generals, according
to Coach Emmer, played hard,
with pride and competitiveness.
Among the scorers for W&L
credited with two goals were
Mike Schuler, George Santos,
Bob Carpenter, and Geoff
Brent. Others included Geoff
Wood, Jerry Broccoli, and John
Sancilio. UMBC boosted their
season record to 8 and 3 while
the Generals slipped to 6-4,
eliminating them from NCAA

Ass Lax ClosesWith Loss

Division I tournament competi-
tion.

Though the 6-4 season record
was a rather bitter disappoint-
ment, Emmer was pleased with
the ‘‘fine effort’’ his players
gave throughout the season.
Next year, with the loss of
several valuable graduating
seniors, ‘‘There will be a lot of
holes to fill,’ says Emmer. Yet
with the progressive experience
of some of the younger players,
W&L will, with luck, remain a
Division I threat.

ODAC Adds One

Pending re-classification this
June from NCAA Division I to
Division III status, Catholic
University was approved Mon-
day, May 18 as the tenth
member of the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference at the

league’s annual spring
meetings held here.
The vote, taken by the

athletic directors of the nine
present ODAC member col-
leges, approves Catholic for
competition in conference
championship events beginning
in September, 1982. The vote
carries the stipulation that
Catholic, iocated in
Washington, D.C., be given
Division III (no athletic

scholarship) status by the
NCAA Classification Commit-
tee at its June meeting. Catholic
petitioned the NCAA in 1980 for
the change.

Catholic will become the se-
cond non-Virginia college to
enter the league, which began
Operations in fall, 1976 with
eight Virginia colleges as
charter members: Bridgewater
College, Eastern Mennonite
College, Emory & Henry Col-
lege, Hampden-Sydney College,
Lynchburg College, Randolph-
Macon College, Roanoke Col-
lege, and Washington and Lee
University. Maryville College,
located in Tennessee, joined the
ODAC in the summer of 1979.

_ Experienced Gridders Show Promise

by John M. Cleghorn

The beginning of the 1981 foot-
ball season will be the first time
that head coach Gary Fallon
will have a team that he can call
his own. The upcoming season
will be Fallon’s fourth and the
team will be made up of players
that have all been recruited by
his staff. This might not be a
marked date for any other
school but for Washington and
Lee, whose football program is
in the midst of a turnaround, the
date only marks promise. The
records for the last three
seasons have improved
moderately from 2-8 to 3-7 to
last season’s 6-4 and _ the
Generals show potential for
continued improvement. In the
Falcon’s words ‘‘you don’t. get
too fancy too fast.”’

The Generals only graduate
six seniors leaving a team that
is very old in comparison to the
last several years. Coach
Fallon remarks, “‘this will be
the first time that we will be
looking at other teams eye to
eye instead of looking up to
them.” The biggest loss to the
Generals will be in the offensive
line. Three seniors will not
return leaving a line which in
Fallon’s words ‘“‘has the size
and the strength but not the ex-

perience, the boys will have to
grow up in a hurry.” Chris
Cavelline will return at
tailback, a player who last
season might have become
W&L’s first 1000 yard rusher
had not injury gotten in the
way. Several talented quarter-
backs return including the two
players that have shared the
position for the last three years.
The defense returns the bulk of
its talent running the 5-2 again
with several variations.

Many of the Generals have
spent their spring as members
of the Barbell club. The club
gives the players a chance to
maintain and improve their
strength in the off season. ‘‘We
encourage our kids to get in-
volved in it (the Barbell club),”’
comments coach Fallon, ‘“‘it
isn’t mandatory. Our kids have
taken onto themselves to be in
there and prove their size, their
strength, and their confidence.”

The Generals will report to
school on the 22nd of August and
begin their training for the
opener against Gettysburg on
the 12th of September. The
Generals will be joined by an
‘‘impressive’’ group. of
freshmen. ‘‘We’re getting
starters off of some outstanding
teams, with some fairly good

size for a change,’’ comments
Fallon.

The competition in the ODAC
will be no help to the Generals’
progress. ‘“‘Emory and Henry,
Randolph-Macon, Maryville,
Bridgewater, and Hampden-
Sydney are all contenders,”
says coach Fallon, ‘‘Anybody
can beat anybody on a given
Saturday. We’re only concerned
with who we play next.”

 

 

Fourth Year Head Coach Gary Fallon

With all the factors included,
the age of the team, the off-
season training, the leadership
and experience the Generals
have a good shot at continuing
the rising winning tradition at
W&L. Next season will bring
quality football at W&L pro-
duced by head coach Gary
Fallon which may lead to fewer
minks abandoning the second
half to refill their flasks.

Rugger’s Season Builds For Future

by L. E. Babits

The Generals rugby team
spent the entire season learning
how to play rugby. When the
spring season began, there
were three players who had
more than five games’ playing
time. In addition to these
“veterans,” five others had
played in the fall season and
knew some of the rudiments. A
good recruiting effort brought
out some very skilled athletes,
but they had to be trained.

Knowing that the Generals
would be short on experience
meant that far more time had to
be spent on basics and working
people into unfamiliar roles
which were vital to a team con-
cept. Match scheduling attemp-
ted to provide the ruggers with
opposition better organized and
more experienced than they to
hasten the learning process.
Playing against better op-
ponents meant that learning
would be more rapid but win-
ning might be difficult.

The first match against a
mixed Aside from Virginia
Tech showed how far the
Generals had come in_ the
spring practices but did not pro-
duce a win because the
Generals gave up 15 points in
penalties and lost 19-18. The
next two matches, against
Longwood and Lynchburg Col-
lege, were both won on the
strength of aggressive play and
a hard hitting defense. Exams
brought a respite from practice
and this break might have hurt
the team.

The Generals were next in ac-
tion on a five-game tour of
North Carolina. This tour was
designed to provide a concen-
trated, sink or swim, learning
exercise. Evaluation of the
results is difficult because the
Generals suffered so many in-
juries that the team was effec-
tively crippled at key positions
for some time. Nevertheless,
the tour must be considered a
success. The ruggers played
well but lost to UNC-Greens-
boro and Greensboro City RFC
on the first weekend.

Against UNC-Chapel Hill, the
ruggers were clearly outclassed
by the Tarheel backs, many of
whom were British studying in
the states. The Generals nearly
knocked off NC State, despite
playing with only 14 players for
most of the second half. Finally,
on the last day of the tour, the
Generals went ahead, fell
behind and then rallied
magnificently to defeat Cape
Fear RFC in Wilmington.

Immediately upon returning
to Lexington, the Generals
played host to Belsize Park, a
British touring side from north
London. An early lead was lost,
then regained and lost again as
the battered, tired Generals
were outfinessed by their
British opponents. The lessons
of that day were drummed into
the Generals at the party
following the match and the
results were seen quickly. Four
days later the W&L ruggers
took on powerful Roanoke and
jumped out to an early 10 point
lead before falling short in the
end.

By this time in the season,
virtually all the Generals were
playing two games because so
many players had given up or
had been injured. It is difficult
to guess about what might have
been had these summer soldiers
had the courage to stick it out.
Those who did stick it out all
erded playing on the first side
at one time or another. The
team also began to resemble a
bandaid brigade as the ac-
cumulating aches and pains
were continually aggravated by
more playing. Oh well, ‘‘no rest
for the weary”’ and all the other
cliches about tough going would
be redundant now.

Following the disappointing
loss to Roanoke, the Generals
went down to Blacksburg ex-
pecting to play VPI’s second
side. Instead, they were faced
with the Hokie A team which
had just made the final eight
teams of the Eastern Rugby
Union Collegiate Tournament to
pick an eventual national cham-
pion. The Hokies gave the
Generals fits, although W&L
never gave up. The next day,
the Generals rebounded and
battled Lynchburg City right
down to the wire before losing in
a light drizzle.

The players were so hurt and
tired that only one practice was
held the next week and that was
short and light before the final

two matches. Great things

come to those who wait and
persevere. In their final home
game the Generals thrashed

Winchester as they played a

tremendous second half. In

their final game, the ruggers
came from behind to defeat

New River RFC in Radford.

The final 5-9 record does not
reflect accurately on the perfor-
mance of the ruggers. Until
their last two matches, they
played teams far more ex-
perienced and with a better
source of players. Yet the

Generals probably should have
won two or three of those
matches and were competitive
in all but the second VPI match.
At the end, the team proved that
learning through competitive
play and teamwork could pro-
duce a superior team in due
time. It seemed a shame to end
the season just as the pieces
finally fell into position.

There were many notable
episodes and heroes aplenty
over the course of the spring.
Workhorses_ included Lee
Minetree and Tim Griffin in the
backs and Todd Alexander and
Gene Newton in the forwards
and there were other standouts
too numerous to mention. Herb
Funsten kicked the team to vic-

tory with his accurate toe. The
entire forward unit, as a group,
jelled quickly and held their
own against all opposition. The
more loosely organized backs,
hampered by injuries, inex-
perience and a lack of defensive
teamwork took longer to come
around, but their final matches
were quite good.

Despite the loss of seniors like
Griffin, Minetree, Herdlin, Gor-
don, Foy and Johnson, the team
now has a solid foundation with
which to start the fall season.
Replacement of players at
several key positions will be
necessary before the standard
of play against Winchester and
New River is attained again.
Potential Virginia Collegiate

players include Todd Alexander
at hooker, Gene Newton at
flanker, Herb Funsten at

Number 8 and Chris Leiser at
wing. A good turnout by the stu-
dent body might press these
players to keep their jobs and
that would have to help the
team immensely,

All in all, the ruggers achiev-
ed some success in creating a
core of players for the future
and won some games. Although
the initial pre-season goal of an
undefeated season was not at-
tained, the spring season must
be regarded as a highly suc-
cessful effort on the part of the-

players who struggled against
adversity for so long. Well done,
I say.

Nunley Is Scholar-Athlete

Lonnie D. ‘‘Chip’’ Nunley, a
Washington and Lee senior
from Bristol, Va., received the
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference’s Harry G. “‘Doc’’ Jop-

Counter-Culture At W&L

AOAOA: Expressing Difference Through Posters

by Ted Fletcher

Unlike most students at
Washington and Lee, AOAOA
members seem content to be
different from their peers, and
to express that difference
through obscure posters on the
Colonnade. The authors of this
‘xerox art’? maintain that the
original concept was derived
from ‘‘the seedier portions of
the somewhat pseudo-psycho-
surrealist portions of their
brains.’’ Calling themselves ar-
tists, they seek to expand the
consciousness of their
classmates by posting inter-
pretations and expressions of
‘some kind of reality,
something close to cabbage’ —
other members would say “‘car-
rots’’ instead — ‘‘and accoun-
tants.’’ They do not go together
very well, but they are both im-
portant. Needless to say,

The Four Certainties

 

 

 

AOAOA is an_ unusual, if
obscure, combination of enter-
tainment and alternative ideas.

And just what is ‘‘xerox art’’?
It is part of a new movement —
gastro-intestinal or otherwise —
in cheap surrealism. Basically
an obscure poster is created
and then submitted to an un-
suspecting Xerox machine,
sometimes causing the machine
to blink ‘‘Call key operator,” for
the rest of the day. To a large
extent, the posters are a reac-
tion to the dull and bland poster
campaigns of other campus
organizations. ‘‘The Xerox copy
is the king for communication
of events on campus, sO we
thought we would jump into the
act and throw in our interpreta-
tion of Xerox art.’’ Undoubtedly
the Dadaist and Surrealist in-
fluences are immediately ap-
parent; as one member said’:
“Essentially this is just an ex-
tension of the Dada movement
from the Teens and the Twen-
ties; Dada is just crazy, ran-
dom free association of words
and objects.” For AOAOA the
medium is to a large extent the
message.

The first AOAOA poster was
the poem entitled ‘‘Dear
Citizens of the People’s
Republic of the United States”’
which can be found in the back

  

robber fly attacking a grasshopper

of this fall’s Ariel. ‘‘We had
originally put a large number of
copies inside Lee Chapel for
Tom Wolfe’s speech last spring.
Unfortunately one of the little
old ladies who worked there
“spotted our efforts at obscuri-
ty, and took most of the posters
away before anyone could seem
them.’ Taking in stride the
snub of the Lee Chapel staff,
they returned in the fall with a
more determined effort. In the
early days of AOAOA copies
were put up late at night under
the cover of darkness.
Responses to the posters were
varied, ranging from applause
to perplexity to indignation. Of
course, any reaction was
welcome. One member said
this: “I can’t understand why
some people get excited about
people trying to be provocative,
so my intention in putting these
up is two-fold: one is to express
alternative ideas, and the se-
cond is to ingrate those people
who can not tolerate free ex-
pression.”’

Yet there is a message that
seeks to awaken the awareness
of the Washington and Lee com-
munity to alternative ideas
about energy, sex roles, social
values, and tolerance of dif-
ferent personal habits. AOQAOA
has been called W&L’s

desperate example of a
“counter-culture;’’ one person
called it the ‘‘pseudo-radical de-
viant fringe of an otherwise col-
orless, textureless,
homogeneous student body.”
When asked whether their
posters were a direct attack on
the common lifestyle at this
school AOAOA’s response was
ambiguous. Although the
posters are to a large extent a
social comment about the state
of modern life, they are also
poignant attacks at what some
students see especially lacking
at this school — sincere, effec-
tive communication in mean-
ingful inter-personal relations.
‘“‘Now wait a minute, let’s not
get too heavy with the high con-

sciousness Crap.”’

More than anything else
AOAOA’s posters seek to blend
humor, albeit obscure, with dif-
ferent, heretofore unvoiced,
ideas. ‘‘On the one hand we are
trying to expose people to dif-
ferent things, and on the other
hand we are just trying to be
entertainers.” They are trying
to make people think and go
‘‘huh?”’, but also to make peo-
ple laugh. One might say the
essential difference that
separates AOAOA from the
larger body of students is the
need to conform to pre-
established rules of conduct and
the need to express one’s in-
dividuality.

“The Boy Dean Proto-type”

They are roaming the campus by the droves

The Boy Dean Prototype is swinging low.

The boy-dean lurks in every room

His glasses fogged by his Daddy’s doom.

He acts like he is way ahead,

But his Mummy still makes his bed.

The Boy Dean wears his trousers high

Take his checkbook and he would die.

Their Mummies and Daddies are so proud
Their Boy-Dean Kiddies are like them now

The Boy-Dean prototype marches on

Am IL impressed?

The Boy-Dean’s favorite cocktail line,

Mummy's great and Missy's fine.

He gets his watchbands from L.L. Bean,

They could be pink, they could be green.

Take off your Ray-bans and open your eyes

And discover your feces still attracts flies.

| Two Receive Lature Awards

Two sophomores, Craig T.
Albanese and John C.
Vlahoplus, have received the
first Rupert N. Latture Awards,
presented by W&L’s chapter of
Omicron Delta Kappa.

Since Omicron Delta Kappa,
the national organization
recognizing outstanding leaders

on college campuses, is limited -

to juniors and seniors, the Lat-
ture Award was established to
recognize outstanding leader-
ship and service among
members of the sophomore
class.

Albanese, a chemistry and
biology major from Melville,
N.Y., is a member of Phi Eta
Sigma (freshman honorary
society), Alpha Epsilon Delta
(pre-medical honorary socie-
ty), the Student Recruitment
Committee, and the universi-
ty’s ad hoc committee on liberal
education. In addition, he is a
member of the W&L varsity
lacrosse team and an orderly at
Stonewall Jackson Hospital in

Lexington.

Viahoplus, en economics ma-
jor from Columbia, S.C., recent-
ly won the prestigious Harry S.
Truman Scholarship, awarded
to only one student from each
state. He is a member of Phi
Eta Sigma, the Student Recruit-
ment Committee’ the fencing
team, and Pi Kappa Phi social
fraternity. He was recently
elected junior representative to
the study body executive com-

mittee for 1981-82. Vlahoplus
also received the Phi Beta Kap-
pa Award in March in recogni-
tion of his perfect 4.0 grade
point average.

The Latture Award is named
in honor of the last surviving
member of Omicron Delta Kap-
pa. Latture, a 1915 graduate of
W&L, was professor of political
science at the university from
1920 to 1962. He now serves as
assistant to the president.

students who will be seniors in
high school this fall.

Dr. John F. DeVogt, pro-
fessor of administration at
W&L, is directing the program
which will be held from July 5
through July 31.

During the four-week period,
participants will take two
courses that they choose from
among 12 different offerings
ranging from ‘‘The Chemistry
of Life’ to “‘Leadership in the

particular interests of the
students involved — interests
such as music, dramatics,
radio/TV productions, _ jour-
nalism, photography, etc. —
which are outside the regular
course offerings.

There will also be extensive
recreational and social ac-

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

A Time Of Uncertainty

For most college seniors, this is a time of uncertain-
ty. For more than a decade, life has been molded
around education and learning. Summers always
meant long vacations, the remainder of the year
meant school. Now school is nearing its end and the
familiar surroundings are about to disappear.

But our education has prepared us for the uncer-
tainty of the future, an uncertainty that is real and
scary, but an uncertainty that we should look upon
with anticipation. We are somehow ready for this
uncertainty. And somehow we know that in the end,
we'll make it.

Uncertainty about the future is not restricted to
American college seniors. But here, our uncertainty
is over salaries and marriage, taxes and entertain-
ment. We do have the same concerns as millions of
other people around the world, an uncertainty about
all those things we as Americans take for granted.

In Israel, the people are uncertain whether tomor-
row means facing another deadly war with the Arabs.
In Poland, uncertainty whether a foreign superpower
will invade the Poles freedom starved country
prevails. In El Salvador, uncertainty means surviv-
ing the daily massacres by both left wing and right
wing fanatics. And in India, starvation magnifies the
uncertainty of waking up tomorrow.

With the education Washington and Lee seniors now
have acquired comes a responsibility to use the
education positively. Use your education to preserve
America’s hope for tomorrow. Use your education to
solve the problems America faces in the future. And
use your education to permit others to learn what you
have learned. Everyone should be as fortunate as
you, the class of 1981.

Law Students Irritate Undergrads

Dear Editor:

As the school year comes to a
close, it seems that many of the
members of the Law School
wish to withdraw their opposi-
tion to the unification of the Law
and Undergraduate Schools. It
appears that the Under-
graduate library has been in-

vaded by the ‘‘more important” °

law students studying for their
ominous finals. What these
students do not seem to realize
is that the Undergraduate
library is not the Law School
library and that it does not
belong solely to the ‘‘so much
smarter and superior than thou
(Undergraduates )’’ law
students.

We seem to recall a few law

! Dthe editor:

ekg ig

 

    

 

students expressing their opin-
ions on the opposition to the
unification of the Law and
Undergraduate Schools in the

March 12, 1981 issue of the
RING-TUM PHI. From the let-
ter, the sixteen included law
students believe ‘The two
schools should not be forced into
an unnatural unity, but should

instead be allowed a separate
and equal co-existence.” If this
philosophy were true, then the
Undergraduates should not be
forced to put up with the rules
and regulations inflicted on us
by the law students benefiting
from the use of our library.

The Undergraduates are
more than happy to accom-
modate the law students in our
library, but in the future, the
law students must remember
that it is our library and that
they do not run it nor do they
have the right to regulate the
Undergraduates who use the
library.

Respectfully submitted,

Commentary By Scott M

The Glorification Of An Ex-Con

Several months ago rock star John Lennon was
shot and killed. Earlier this Spring President
Ronald Reagan was struck by an assassin’s bullet.
And now Pope John Paul rests in critical condition
as a result of an attempt on his life.

Last Wednesday night in Lee Chapel I sat
fascinated as I heard the tale of ex-con Frank
Abagnale. At the conclusion of his story I gave him
a rousing round of applause and left Lee Chapel in
a State of utter enthrallment. I contemplated sen-
ding Mr. Abagnale a ten dollar check for his
autobiography, ‘“‘Catch Me If You Can’”’ when the
harsh realization of just what exactly I was doing
suddenly dawned. Frank Abagnale was a
criminal, a fugitive of the law. He stole, cheated,
lied, and literally ripped off millions, if not
billions, of dollars. Now Frank Abagnale, at the
age of 33, makes his living by using his reputation.
Frank Abagnale is not modest about telling his life
story, how many stunts he pulled, how many
phony checks he forged, and from how many
prisons he escaped. He is not modest about being
given the rare classification of ‘‘Master Thief”’ or
of having television shows and motion pictures
based upon his life. Frank Abagnale has, so justice
says, paid his debt to society. He no longer makes
his money by swindling innocent people. He is,
they say, no longer a criminal. On the contrary,

Frank Abagnale is now a nationwide hero.

Perhaps the greatest irony of it all is that Frank
Abagnale still remains a con. He and his company
take in over $10-million a year, and that money
comes largely from those of us who pay for Frank
Abagnale’s autobiography, his T-shirts, and his
other promotional knik-knaks. Perhaps the
greatest crime is owed to the American people in
elevating Abagnale from a thief toa saint.

The American people have been repulsed at the
death of Lennon and the attempted assassinations
of Reagan and Pope John Paul. Yet the American
people turn around and praise a man like Frank
Abagnale, a criminal, for his “fascinating”
pranks. It is, perhaps, the act of glorifying Frank
Abagnale which is so repulsive, which so utterly
degrades the human race.

As one fellow student put it, “‘Abagnale’s speech
would have been great if it had been a stand up
comedy act.’’ But it was real, and Abagnale was
speaking of real live people who fell prey to his
vicious schemes. Frank Abagnale is and always
will be a con. But if Americans continue to exalt
Abagnale as a hero then he has succeeded in conn-
ing us all. And that, my friends, is, indeed,
repulsive.

try again. By then it may work.
For the first time in many
years, the numerous subcom-
mittees under the Executive
Committee’s jurisdiction were
tightly controlled. The EC re-
quired every subcommittee
ranging from the SAB to Cold
Check to appear monthly with
financial reports. Committee
members, especially Marshall
Clark, often grilled the many
chairmen’ who _ presented
monthly reports, asking them
questions that had never before
been asked by an EC. The com-
mittee’s efforts appear to have
paid off; money is no longer
wasted (except by the SBA’s
social committee), and commit-
tees are more effectively
operated. There is no excuse for
this practice to be discontinued
in the future.

Similarly, it is hoped that
future EC’s, especially next
year’s, will bear in mind the
alcohol survey requested by the
committee. Usually, an Ex-
ecutive Committee concerns

necessary for keeping the stu-
dent government running. ‘Ins

year, however, junior EC
member Eric Myers perceived
a drinking: problem at W&L,
discussed the matter with the
committee, and initiated the
survey which was_ released
several weeks ago. Unfor-
tunately, it is again too late in
the year to do anything about
this important issue now, but
next year’s committee already
has the groundwork laid for it.
It will have to follow-up closely
the work of this EC.

The committee should also be
commended for its important
discussions about the disunity
that exists between the law
school campus and_ the
undergraduate colonnade. This
too is an extremely touchy mat-
ter and one that could balloon
into a crucial issue in the com-
ing years. Bob Willis & Co. met
with the SBA earlier this year in

an effort to figure out how the
two campuses can be united

‘spiritually’ if not physically.
Although it will take many
more meetings and many more
hours of discussion before the
matter is resolved, initial ef-
forts by the EC have again il-
lustrated that no issue was too

large for the committee to han-

dle.

The Executive Committee
has proved itself this year in all
aspects of student government
except for one — student elec-
tions. Elections for class and
student body officers and
amendment changes were con-
ducted in a manner which,
more times than not, dissuaded
students from voting. Polls
were not always manned, cam-
paign violations were common,
and once a poll actually ran out
of ballots. Put simply, elections
were a farce.

Board is partly responsible for
the serious problems, but the

ultimately responsible for en-
suring that committees do their
jobs effectively. The EC should
be credited for at least discuss-
ing the problems. Sophomore
EC member Pete Baumgaert-
ner even chaired a small sub-
committee examining the pro-
blem, But drastic steps need to
be taken now, before the next
elections in the fall. ue
the VRB should be staffed ex
clusively with EC members or
abolished forever.

Using this year’s Executive
Committee as a prime example
of how a student body should be
run, future EC’s should be able
to accomplish much of what
needs to be done. Probably no
E€ can ever do everything that
needs doing, but this committee
came close. It made a few
mistakes, and it could have
handled some issues more ef-
fectively. But students should
be pleased that they were well
represented this year. Future
Executive Committees have
their work cut out for them.
