Hartog Compares Admissions

by Mike Perry

The notion that it is difficult to
get into college may be out-
dated except for a select group
of well-known schools, accor-
ding to a new study by the Col-
lege Board.

The Board’s study contends
that it is becoming increasingly
easier for students to gain ac-
ceptance to American colleges
and universities. The study
reported that 83 percent of col-
lege applications were accepted
in 1978 and suggests that almost
every student applying to col-
lege found one to attend.

Director of Admissions
William Hartog agrees with the
report’s findings and says the
situation has existed throughout
much of the 1970’s owing largely

to an overbuilt public educa-
tional system. ‘College admis-
sion competition is far easier,
and it’s going to get easier, ex-
cept for these few colleges, like

‘W&L; Ihope.”’

Hartog says Washington and
Lee competes on a ‘‘fast track”’
with schools such as the Univer-
sity of Virginia, William and
Mary, Davidson and Duke for
qualified applicants; but he also
believes W&L has more than
kept pace with its competitors.

Washington and Lee accepted
56 percent of its applicants last
year and Hartog contends that
W&L’s ‘“‘degree of selectivity
has increased.’’ Washington
and Lee received 975 applica-
tions to its freshman class in
1978 while 1414 students applied

Small Talk With
SAB Co-Chairman

by M. Shaw Pyle

Jamie Small’s face wears a
harried, hurried look these
days, and the Student Activities
Board co-chairman says that
it’s all because of his position.
Small puts in at least 20 hours
each week for the SAB — more
as Fancy Dress approaches.
But he says his frown is not
because of the time involved,
but rather because of the lack of
involvement by his _ fellow
students most of the time.

Small and co-chairman Pryse
Elam have attempted to diver-
sify the type of entertainment
the SAB offers and increase the
numbers of social activities on
campus. So far, Small says, stu-
dent response has been dismal
at best. Attempts to plan pro-
grams to meet requests by in-
terested students, as was done
in the fall Backgammon Tour-
nament and the booking of a na-
tionally known soul group in the
Cockpit, ended in heavy finan-
cial losses when Minks stayed

As _ if Small didn’t have
enough on his hands, a feud
between the SAB and the Ex-
ecutive Committee may be im-
minent. Fueled by rumors, a
basic disagreement between
the two organizations has
started to assume the propor-
tions of a large conflict. Small
complains of the EC’s basic
lack of support for campus
organizations other than itself
and claims that it is so caught
up in mutual admiration among
the members that its effec-

last year. Hartog expects the
number to grow this year.

Hartog explained that a
variety of other factors will con-
tribute or make competition for
the most qualified students ‘‘ex-
cructiating in the next five
years.’’ The number of college-
aged students is expected to
decline by 23 percent.

College admissions officials
must be conscious of trends as
reflected in stastical data and
their effect on W&L’s potential
applicant pool, as-distinct from
national demographic changes.

Hartog cited Virginia as an
example in an article published
recently in Alumni Magazine,
“37,206 high school seniors took
the SAT and may thus be con-
sidered ‘college-bound.’ But
fewer than half of them — 16,486
— were men. And of the men,
only 2,005 scored at or above the
W&L averages on the SAT and
ranked in the top 40 percent of
their classes. And of those 2,005
in Virginia, only 891 came from
families with an income suffi-
cient to pay Washington and
Lee’s tuition.”

The problem of accepting
precisely the number of ap-
plicants which will result in a
freshman class of 350 is par-
ticularly acute this year due to
the campus housing shortage

‘the renovation of Graham-Lees

dormitory is expected to create.
‘‘We cannot have any more than
350 this year,” says Hartog.

W&L will probably accept
770-790 applications in hopes of
attracting a freshman class
which numbers as close to 350
as possible.

96-79!

Crowd cheers on the Tanevale in Tuesday night’s upset over

 

W&L Stuns Roanoke

by Dale Park

“We really appreciate the
crowd and the unknown fans.
Without them, we could not
have won the ballgame.”

The man who said these
words was Washington and Lee
Hea@ basketball Coach Verne
Canfield. The game he was
referring to was his team’s
stunning 96-79 trouncing of
Roanoke College, a team
previously ranked fourth in the
nation in the NCAA Division III
of the NCAA.

The win was W&L’s biggest so
far this season, stretching the
Generals’ victory streak to
eight games and pulling W&L
into a first place tie with
Roanoke in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference. Both
Roanoke and W&L are 4-1 in
ODAC play.

Although Roanoke brought a

perfect 14-0 record into the con-
test, Canfield explained that his
team tried not to ‘‘get up too
much for the game, because
after you get up, you can only
come down.”’ Canfield claimed
that his team has tried “‘to play
on an even keel”’ all season.

That ‘‘even keel’? might have
easily been rocked by the
Generals’ loss of senior forward
and co-captain R.J. Scaggs.
Scaggs broke his wrist in W&L’s
82-79 double-overtime victory
over Emory & Henry and will
be out for the remainder of the
year.

Filling in for Scaggs has been
junior forward Clark New. And
New, normally the team’s sixth
man, has done nothing short of
an outstanding job.

New has averaged well over
20 points a game in the con-

Four Alumni Inducted Into ODK

Four prominent alumni of
Washington and Lee University
were inducted as_ honorary

EC Hears More Midterms

by Bill Whalen
The Executive Committee
heard the last of the midterm
reports at Monday night’s two-
and-one-half hour meeting.

Following the reports, the EC
had heated discussions over its
role in both a student-sponsored
game and the Muscular
Dystrophy Danceathon. The
game the EC discussed is a
‘‘killer game’”’ organized by the
Phi Delta Theta fraternity for
the purpose of raising money.
At the end of the announcement
of the game, a statement ap-
pears explaining that the honor
system applies to the rules of
the game.

The EC’s main concern was
whether the statement is a
reference to an individual honor
code or the Washington & Lee
honor system.

After a lengthy discussion,
the committee decided that the
EC would take no direct part in
the rules of the game.

In the matter of the
Danceathon, the EC was con-
sidering whether or not to use
money from its reserve fund as
a donation to a proposed run
from Hollins to this campus by
a Washington & Lee student.

EC President Bob Willis first
brought up the proposal, argu-
ing that an EC donation would
“get more people involved”
with the MD fundraising drive.

Leading the opposition to this

move was EC Vice-President
Willie Mackie. ‘‘We should give
a check to the Danceathon
rather than an individual,’’ said
Mackie, who stressed that the
EC should look at ‘‘the merits of
each case.”’

After trying to pass measures
to either donate the money or
not participate in the run, the
committee resolved to take up
the issue at next week’s
meeting.

In the only financial transac-
tion, the EC approved an $850
grant to the W&L Rugby Club.
The club’s president, Alex
Richards, had requested nearly
$1200, but the EC decided that
the club could set back on
several expenses, including the
purchase of rugby movies and
Gatorade for games.

Speaking for the Admissions
Committee, Mike Perry an-
nounced the school has received
789 applications from prospec-
tive students, while the final
number should be almost 1440.
Perry also stated that the Ad-
missions Office is making an
effort to recruit more students
from the West and Midwest,
while taking attention away
from the Northeast.

Publications Board Chairman
Channing Hall reported to the
EC that the Pub Board has
named Craig Cornett and Prof.
Hampden H. Smith III as its
faculty advisors.

Hall was then questioned by

Willis over last week’s EC
resolution to financially review
student organizations. Hall ex-
plained the Pub Board’s role in
financial review, saying that
“the publications look over
each others’ budgets.”’

Junior Representative Tripp
Brower was in favor of the EC
taking a more active role in
reviewing the records of stu-
dent publications. ‘‘I can see ad-
vantages in the EC reviewing
everyone,’’ said Brower.
“We're not out to get anyone,
we're just trying to make sure
the money is where it is.”

Cold Check Chairman Mike
Malesardi told the EC that his
committee has received bad
checks totalling $1100. Malesar-
di said he sent out 35 letters con-
cerning bad checks, and was
able to clear up ten cases.

Contact spokesman Robert
McLean told the EC that his
committee has raised over
$17,000 from funds given by the
EC, the Intrafraternity Council,
and donations by parents. Con-
tact also announced a line-up of
speakers, which _ Includes
author John Barth, baseball
personality Jom _ Bouton,
political cartoonist Jeff
MacNelly, and famous im-
poster Frank Abagnale.

The EC will hold its next
meeting Monday night at 6:30
p.m.

Burn Hillympus

My ulcer is killing me. Woe is poor Prometheus, humble servant
to the grand race of Fraternal Greeks. Woe is poor Prometheus, a
fallen prince, who dared defy the gods atop Mt. Hillympus. I am
chained like an errant dog, a prisoner in the library; a martyr to
the cause, to the glories of Red Square.

Long, long ago, the gods lived happily atop Mt. Hillympus.
Ensconsced in the etherial bliss of academic, these arbitrary kings
knew little of the trials and tribulations of the angelic Greeks over
whom they ruled. Far removed from the glories of Narcotica and

the horrors of nosexia, the gods (notably one Dr. Seuss) decided to
abolish the entire human race, which is to say they desired to
destroy the Greeks. (For the sake of argument, we won’t include
the independent subspecies of a more simian nature).

The skies trembled and the fun-loving sportive, amorous, inno-
cent mortals ran for cover in their dilapidated sheds. They prayed
to Dr. Seuss to grant them mercy. They called on all the gods and
promised to reform; all they wanted was to go on as happy Greeks.
Again, the skies trembled and Dr. Seuss answered their prayers:

“IT smell a rat in the frat anda nat my flat. No Greeks, no frats ‘till

One god, poor Prometheus (that’s me) heard these ominous
words and the prayers of the poor Greeks. “‘Bring us fire! Bring us
fire! We will burn Mt. Hillympus. We will burn the Hill and all these
false and greedy gods!’’ So I brought fire and fire with a
vengeance. I brought the Greeks fire water! Delicious fire water
that inflames the soul and when consumed in large quanities makes
mortals immortal. Yes, every Wednesday — in defiance of the false
gods —the Greeks consume their fire water.

Yes, every Greek knows Prometheus brought fire to the Greeks.
Now I am chained; an eagle tears at my liver. But little does that
eagle know that I, too, consume fire water. I have no liver left! My

Latture Award Established

The Washington and Lee
University chapter of the na-
tional leadership fraternity,
Omicron Delta Kappa, has an-
nounced establishment of the
Rupert N. Latture Outstanding
Sophomore Award to be given
annually, in the spring, to the
W&L sophomore who best ex-
emplifies the ideals of ODK.

Rupert N. Latture, for whom
the award is named, is the sole

surviving founder of the
organization which orginated
on the W&L campus in 1914.

Latture, who now serves as
special assistant to Washington
and Lee president Robert E.R.
Huntley, celebrated his 89th
birthday on Jan. 18, the day
before ODK announced the new
award in his honor at its annual
induction ceremony.

 

Small

(continued from page 1)
tiveness is greatly diminished.
More specifically, he claims
that its policy of announcing
budget disbursements as late as
October leaves the SAB and
similar groups in a_ bind.
Waiting for funding to plan ac-
tivities may mean missing op-
portunities to book entertain-
ment groups with demanding
schedules; trying to guess at
one’s prospective budget can
lead to overspending, as Small
apologetically admits occurred
this past fall.

And the controversy over the
EC’s review of SAB finances is
a continuing source of conten-
tion. Small accepts the commit-
tee’s right to check the books of
any student funded organiza-
tion, but is furious with its man-
ner of doing so: ‘I told (Bob
Willis, EC president) if he’s
looking at our books to dump on
me or on Pryse or on anybody,
he can take my job and shove
,":

Rumors of another conflict —
a knock-down, drag-out bet-
ween Small and Pryse Elam —
are dismissed out of hand by
Small. He admits to a conflict of
tastes between the two, but at-
tributes occasional flare-ups to
the nature of co-chairmanships
and the personalities involved.
‘‘Pryse and I,’’ observed Small

‘fight a lot. We’re both bull
headed...but...don’t worry.”
Small is convinced that neither
problems with Elam and Willis
nor apathy on the part of the
student body and faculty will
mar Fancy Dress for the year.
Fancy Dress_ preparations
are, in fact, going smoothly and
a little ahead of schedule says

Small. This vear’s nush is to be
on the music. Small says decor

has peaked as an item of enter-

tainment, and his committee’s
shot at immortality will be
made by providing six of the
best bands they could find. John
Prine will play early Thursday
evening, to leave the night open-
ing for pavilion parties spon-
sored — in spite of administra-
tion grumblings — by any
organization willing to do so.
And the Ball itself has five
groups: ‘‘the’ best or-
chestra...we could get beside
Duke Ellington’s,” a ‘‘very
good” Chicago blues band, a
Dixieland jazz ensemble, a 50’s
hot rock group, and a country
and western set. In addition, the
SAB is providing comics,
mimes, magicians, and street
vendors.

Small’s comment on his job is
simple: ‘“‘I’ll help anyone...if
they need a group...but I wish
there’d be more participation
(apathy ) isn’t funny anymore.”
ODK ‘Taps’ 19 New Members

Nineteen undergraduates and
law students at Washington and
Lee University were ‘“‘tapped”’
Monday into membership in
Omicron Delta Kappa, the na-
tional honorary leadership
society. The ceremonies took
place as part of the university’s
annual Founders’ Day convoca-
tion.

Omicron Delta Kappa was
established at Washington in
1914 and now has chapters in
more than 160 colleges and
universities throughout the na-
tion. The society recognizes
superior leadership
achievements in one or more
fields — athletics, student
government, _ publications,
social and religious affairs, and
the creative arts. Students
“tapped”’ must rank in the top
35 percent of their academic
class.

As the date of the superdance
approaches, Superdance ’81 co-
chairman Jay Hemby wishes to
remind W&L students of the
necessity of their support for
both Daniels and Superdance
‘81. He has also attempted to
enlist the help of the VMI cadets
to dance and raise money, Un-
fortunately, the cadets cannot
attend a social event such as
Superdance ’81 without first
receiving a written invitation
from W&L. After the invitation
has been extended, the comma-
dent of the academy must ap-
prove the request. Due to this
cumbersome system, Hemby
believes that only a limited
number of cadets will be allow-
ed to actively participate.

Class Of 84 Posts Higher Grades

by Skeeter Miniter

As forecasted by the high
Scholastic Aptitude test scores
and high class rank, the class of
1984’s Grade Point Average was
considerably higher than first
semester grades in previous
years.

“The aptitude of the class of
1984 certainly was borne out by
the grades they received this
fall’ said Dean of Freshmen, H.
Robert Huntley. Compared with
last year’s freshman fall
semester G.P.A. — con-
siderably below 2.5 — the class
of 1984 had a “‘2.5 plus,” accor-
ding to Huntley. Also, although
last year’s freshmen had 10 per-
cent more students, the number
of freshmen who made honor
roll remained at 31. This year’s

freshman class has 63 Deans
List members also, as opposed
to 57 the year before.

“Overall academic improve-
ment occurred up and down the
line,” according to Huntley. He
defended his case by citing
“‘that only 29/338 were below
the 1.5 probation level as oppos-
ed to 43/365 in the class of 1983.”

‘Admissions sure is doing
their job,’ according to
Huntley. He further explained
that last year “more money
was spent in the search of new
students.”

Huntley also cited that the
success of the freshman class
continues at the same level out-
side the classroom.

“The dorm counselors have

called me with far fewer pro-

blems,’”’ declared Huntley.
“The first auspicious note oc-
curred after the Hollins mixer
when the Dean over there called
back with rave reviews of the
interesting and mature
freshmen from W&L.” Huntley
continued, ‘‘This year’s class is
more the old W&L type, the one
we write about in the catalogue.
The upperclassmen here tend to
be socialistic about grades.
They are concerned with what
they need to see in a course.”’
Perhaps the final tribute
Huntley or anyone else could
make occurred when he said,
“Freshmen maturity tends to

dissipate as Fraternal
foolishness increases. That
didn’t happen this year.”

22 public hearing before the
Lexington Planning Commis-
sion, the Kappa Sigs have com-
piled a list of 60 residences
around the house to plead their
case and hopefully obtain a
favorable concensus for the
hearing. Fraternity president
Scott Dacus said that most of
the residents have been con-
tacted and that he is optimistic.
The only opposition thus far,
has been from the occupants of
the residence behind the old
Kappa Sig house. Oddly enough,
the families on either side have
expressed no opposition.

The former chapter folded in

1970 for financial reasons but a
group of students applied for a
new charter last year and in-
itiated 14 members on May
17th.

The house is occupied, by
Genevieve Friedman, her
children, and a few boarders.
The price has been negotiated
at $90,000. The sale is contingent
on the decision of the Lexington
Planning Commission.

There is currently no area in
the city limits zoned for frater-
nity houses. Permission to
locate a fraternity in Lexington
requires a special exception of
the City Council which acts
upon the recommendation of
the Planning Commission. The
chairman of the Planning Com-
mission is W&L professor H.L.
Ravenhorst. He could not be
reached for comment.

The hearing will begin at 5
p.m. on Jan. 22 in City Hall.

Todd Hobin performed in the
Cockpit Saturday night. His
eyes were electric when he clut-
ched the microphone to his face,
when he ran his fingers through
his hair, when he danced about
in the limited confines of the
“‘stage”’ and into the audience,
taking his Ovation guitar with
him. Everything about his per-
formance was filled with a wild,
frenetic energy that more than
pleased the large audience.

Backstage (a term that can
only be used humorously when
referring to our Pit) Todd Hobin
sat quietly in a folding chair, his
eyes serene, his gestures small
and his voice so soft it was
sometimes drowned out by the
clatter of the other band
members. He Jovks like the guy
up there playing, but he doesn’t
act the same.

‘Everyone says that,’ he
laughed. ‘‘It’s the music. It’s
fun. Some people drink and do
drugs — music is a much better
high. I mean, I’ve chipped my
teeth on microphones before..”’

You can’t tell by looking at
him.

The Todd Hobin Band was
formed in 1975 by Todd, his
brother Shawn, Doug Moncrief
and Desi Desnoyers. Guitarist
Bruce Fowler joined the group
three years ago. Their technical
and vocal skills can be attested
to by anyone who saw them
Saturday. Most of the songs in
their repertoire are original,
although they included some
show-stopping numbers by Bob
Seger and Crosby, Stills, Nash

and Young.
The Band’s second album,
Passion and the Pain,was

released last week and has
already sold 10,000 copies (their
first album, released in 1978,
has sold 12,000 copies to date)
and Todd was swamped last
weekend by phone calls of
praise and congratulations. The
band records under the Aries
label, named after Todd’s dog.
The band’s’ performance
enhances songs that are
refreshing, if for no other
reason because the lyrics are
more than one-dimensional.
“Every song I write,” said
Todd, “Is about something
that’s very real to me. John
Lennon said he wrote on three
themes: love, peace, and ex-
perience. You can take all of
Willie Nelson’s songs, I think,
from the beginning up til now,
back to back, and you’d have a
musical autobiography.

The Todd Hobin Band

Serious, Energetic Professionals

“IT don’t do that. But what I
write isn’t boogie oogie oogie.”’

No, it’s not.

The band is a cohesive unit on
stage and a self-described fami-
ly on the road.

Doug Moncrief, keyboardist,
vocalist and guitarist said ‘‘The
best way to get a band together,
aside from auditions, is to see
how well everyone gets along
together.’’ The band is accom-
panied on road trips by a six-

 

4
Lae
Desi Desnoyers

member crew. Several band
members are married, but their
wives rarely travel with them.

‘My mother didn’t go with
my father to work,’’ said Mon-
crief,

The band travels frequently
up and down the East Coast.
They are planning a southern
tour for the spring and Todd
says the new album is selling in
Ohio and Michigan, where
they’ve never played.

 

 

Bruce Fowler walks over to
where Todd and Doug were be-
where Todd and Doug were be-
ing interviewed. ‘‘What lies are
demands. ‘‘That I’m 62 and
blond?”’

The band’s closeness is pretty
obvious. ;

They return home to upstate
New York to play a show with
the Allman Brothers this week
before coming back to Virginia
for appearances at Ferrum and

 

 

Shawn Hobin
Dabney Lancaster Community
College. Talk about passion and
the pain! Actually, they’re used
to small college towns; Todd
and Doug graduated from the
Crane School of Music in tiny
Crane, N.Y.

The Todd Hobin Band is a suc-
cess by any measure, certainly
they are hot. Without trying to
sound cliche, not much appears
to stand between them and the
top.

Alcohol Film

The film, ‘‘I’ll Quit Tomor- described. ‘I'he progress of the

row” is based on a book with the
same title, written by Vernon E.
Johnson.

There are three films with a
total running time of 88
minutes. The first film (30
minutes) will be shown on
Wednesday, January 28, as a
part of a workshop by the Fami-
ly Life Council of the Mental
Health Association of
Rockbridge County with help
from Alcohol Services of
Rockbridge (ASOR). The film
will be shown at V.M.I. at Le-
jeune Hall, second floor,
7:30-9:30 p.m. on Wednesday,
January 28.

The film belongs to ASOR and
all three films may be borrowed
by any local organization.

The story line:

The film tells of what happen-
ed to Steve Miller and his fami-
ly as he develops the illness of
alcoholism. How it progressed
in his family and work life is

disease is traced, how it was ar-
rested by a successful interven-
tion by the family and
employer, and how treatment
was given in a hospital setting.
The film describes the behavior
of the significant persons
around Steve and how they at
first enabled him to get sicker,
but later helped in his recovery.

Much valuable information
about clinical dependency is
given in a voice, over which
conveys facts about the illness
and treatment.

The film to be seen on
Wednesday, January 28th,
shows the mood swing syn-
drome and physiology of
chemical dependency and the
urgent need for outside help.

A Rocker Returns

‘Catholic Boy’ and the
Comeback of Jim Carroll

by RobinC. Meredith _

Take equal measures of Patti Smith, Tonio K.,
and the Boomtown Rats, blend thoroughly, throw
in a dash of Lou Reed to add an appropriately
streetwise atmosphere, and if your imagination
stretches that far you’ll have a decent idea of what
the Jim Carroll Band’s debut album sounds like.
That’s one reason I’ve had so much trouble
evaluating this record; the man appeals to my
natural instincts so thoroughly I find it hard to be
objective — listening to the Jim Carroll Band for

 

Recordings

 

me is like downing a favorite bottle of wine or
biting into a juicy thick steak. My problems aside,
the fact remains that Carroll has been causing
quite a stir in some rather high places lately;
Penthouse has already done an in-depth interview
with him, his album is doing quite well on the
charts (81 with a bullet after 3 weeks, a strong
showing for a debut), and the single from the
album, ‘‘People Who Died’, has been getting
more than its share of play on album rock radio.

Why all this fuss over a left-field debut effort?
One look at the ‘‘saga”’ of Jim Carroll and I’m su’
you’ll understand. Born and raised in Manhatt:
Carroll became addicted to heroin practic:
before reaching puberty. An_ extraordin.
athlete, he attended a private high school on .
basketball scholarship, and at the age of thirteen
wrote The Basketball Diaries, a collection of
autobiographical writing that prompted Jack
Kerouac to claim that ‘‘at 13 years of age, Jim
Carroll writes better than 89 percent of the
novelists working today.’

That was in 1963. Since then, Carroll’s work has

appeared in several literary journals, including
the Paris Review. His second volume of poetry,
Living at the Movies, was nominated for a Pulitzer
Prize. He kicked heroin in 1971. Now, at the age of
30, he has a band and analbum.

This is a classic rock’n’roll legend with a very
definite twist. It looks as though Carroll has
already gone through the personal catharsis that
marred the careers of other ‘‘legends’’ like Jim
Morrison, Brian Jones, and Janis Joplin. Carroll
“settled down” into rock’n’roll; consequently,
Catholic Boy lacks the urgency and, to be honest,
the borderline insanity that made debut efforts by
his spiritual brethren (Smith’s Horses, Tonio K.s
Life in the Foodchain) such breathtaking ex-
periences. Amateur passion is conspicuously ab-
sent here. Part of this has to do with Carroll’s own
instincts, which are remarkably mainstream for
this day and age. His songs are suffused with an
optimistic, melodic warmth that flies in the face of
New Wave dissonance. Reactionary musical
values and a lack of cutting edge passion make
this a curiously uninspiring record. |

There are moments here, to be sure. People Who
Died is a grisly obituary set at a breakneck tempo
over a wall of blazing guitars. City Drops Into the
Night is as good a piece of post-Springsteen street-
wise romanticism as anyone has come up with yet,
and Nothing Is True, an evocative ballad, shows
that Carroll’s restraint is not always a bad thing.

All in all, this is a very promising debut.
Hopefully, Carroll’s career won’t be plagued by ig-
norant journalists who expect him to live up to a
legend that he would probably rather see forgotten
(myself included). For this, we’ll just have to wait
and see. In the meantime, give Catholic Boy an A-
and pray that Carroll sees fit to include a lyric
sheet with his next album.

The Ring-tum Phi Presents A Midterm Ana

by W. Cope Moyers

This year’s Executive Committee has
done an impressive job during its first five
months in office governing the student
body. Unlike some previous administra-
tions, this committee has experienced few
internal squabbles and has actively wrestl-
ed with crucial issues important to the
university and students. The EC attempts
to change the pass/fail system, revise the
procedures governing student body elec-
tions and constitution and tighten the
budget should be applauded. Although the
committee’s efforts have far outpaced
results, this year’s committee has con-
tinued to work hard to affect changes it
believes are necessary.

One of the most positive. steps taken by
this Executive Committee has been tighter
control of the many university sub-
committees under EC jurisdiction. In past
years, many of these committees rarely
appeared before the EC and ran things as
they wished. In several cases, too many of
these sub-committee members were
answerable to nobody bui themselves.
That has changed since Bob Willis and Co.

PARR

   

JEFF EDWARDS

have taken a closer loak at sub-committee
operations. Each committee, from Contact
to Student Health, is now required to ap-
pear before the EC each month and pre-
sent written reports on past, present and
future activities. There have been in-
stances in which the EC has ordered a sub-
committee to return before the committee
because of unsatisfactory reports. These
actions have made the subcommittees
more efficiently and effectively run and
made them more answerable to the EC.
But the committee’s efforts to control all
the subcommittees has not been without
some controversy, as seen in the con-
tinuous tug-of-war between the Publica-
tions Board and EC. This confrontation
has generated unneeded animosity bet-
ween members of the two committees and
is still not completely resolved. Hopefully
this issue will be put to rest before the end
of the school year.

The committee should also be commend-
ed for actively pursuing the question of
adequate security for students while on
and off campus. The EC’s handling of this
matter has prompted the Lexington City
Council, Lexington police chief and even
university president Huntley to address
the issue with promises of more support.
The EC has done all it possibly could to
guarantee the safety of both students and
their personal property. It is now up to city
officials to implement the steps necessary
to keep students safe. Future Executive
Committees should take note of this com-
mittee’s actions on the matter, especially
if adequate security is absent in the future.

This Executive Committee has also
recognized the need for clarifications and
revisions in the honor system. President
Bob Willis has said he would like to rewrite
parts of the honor code, a massive yet im-

 

   

BOB WILLIS

portant project the committee has before
it. If the committee plans on instituting the

’ changes before the end of this year, it will

have to work against the clock — June is
approaching quickly.

Students are well-represented by this
year’s Executive Committee. Not only do
members concern themselves with pro-
blems inherent to the entire university
community, but they also have confronted
the individual problems common to each
of the four classes and the law school. If
the EC works as hard the next five months
as it did the first five, then Willis and Co.
will be remembered as hard working

 

  
   

MIKE NOGAY

tough, objective and — most important
—capable of recognizing the many pro-
blems synonymous with a small, private
university and complex honor code.

Bob Willis — The president of the Ex-
‘ecutive Committee knows what he is doing
and what the committee should be doing.
Senior Bob Willis is the kind of president
the EC and student body needed. He is a
leader, but he permits others on the com-
mittee to take the lead on many of the im-
portant issues. He is patient, allowing
anyone to talk who wants to, yet hauling in
the reins when necessary. He can be cool
under pressure, but he can get tough when
it’s important for him to be tough. He
discusses matters with the mayor, police
chief, professor and student alike, yet has
the ability to listen.

Most EC meetings proceed smoothly
because Willis is knowledgable on what’s
to be discussed even before the full com-
mittee meets. He knows the honor code
and constitution well enough to comment
freely and confidently on matters concern-
ing them. But he is never afraid to look
something up when he or the committee is
confused; meetings are sometimes
delayed a minute or two while Willis
checks the White Book.

This year’s EC has already tackled
several timely problems and Willis is
directly responsible. Amendments to the
constitution were already approved and
ready for student vote in late October, the
ongoing controversy with the Publications
Board was discussed at the first EC

WILLIE MACKIE

meeting and the security problem was
discussed quickly and without delay.

Willis also gets the credit for recent
changes in the pass/fail system. Although
he was fighting against heavy odds and his
original proposals were greatly trimmed
by an uncompromising courses and
degrees committee, Willis did change a
rigid system that has needed revisions for
many years.

Willis has once and for all made the
many subcommittees that operate at W&L
directly answerable to the EC. Gone are
the days when subcommittees did what
they wanted, wasted money and failed to
do what they were supposed to do. Willis
and the EC now watch these subcom-
mittees closely and question them on even
the most trivial matters.

Willis has also recognized that the honor
system needs some amending and he has
said he is going to affect the necessary
changes by June. He cannot do it alone, but
because Willis is a strong and well-
respected student body president, there is,
for the first time in many years, a real
chance the changes can be made.

It is still too early in the year to judge
Willis’ full impact as a tough, yet com-
promising president. That can only be
done in June, when the executive commit-
tee finishes up its work. A lot will happen
in the coming months and Willis is ready to
approach problems that will inevitably oc-
cur.

Willie Mackie — If there is anyone who
knows where the money is, where it’s go-
ing and why it’s going there, it has to be
vice-president and treasurer Willie
Mackie. He is in full control of all the
money allocated to the EC and ultimately,
the student body. Mackie is innovative
enough to deposit concert money returned

    

MARSHALL CLARK

from the Firefall concert in a account that
draws interest and makes money for the
student body. Yet he is conservative
enough to have allocated the numerous
subcommittees only enough money to
operate efficiently. Mackie has trimmed
the fat from the meat and has made
enemies because of it.

Money is not Mackie’s sole responsibili-

 

BUD WHITE

ty and he has often helped Willis guide EC
meetings in a constructive direction.
Mackie is a leader, yet he does not get in
the way of Willis, who is without a doubt
the boss. Mackie’s no nonsense approach
as a treasurer is often reflected in his sug-
gestions and comments at meetings; he
gets right to the point and does not dance
around an argument.

Like most of the other committee
members, Mackie is serious about his
work as an officer of the student body. He
works hard at a job loaded with serious
responsibilities and daily decisions. When
the time comes for a new EC treasurer to
assume control, he will not have to worry
about the committee’s financial position.
Mackie has things under control.

Bud White — The secretary of the EC
rarely has time to contribute to discus-
sions since he is busy trying to record the
minutes, a monumental task which posed
some problems for him earlier in the year.
The minutes were often difficult to read
and not as accurate as they should have
been. However, White has taken some
positive steps to resolve this problem and
recent editions of the minutes have
reflected his efforts.

Thanks to White’s dedication, each week
the minutes are posted at various points
around the campus — there can be no stu-
dent complaints that they don’t know what
the EC is doing. As long as the minutes are
accurate and readable, students can
review discussions and votes of the com-
mittee even without attending the

   

JIM VINES
meetings.

When White does get the chance to par-
ticipate in committee discussions, he often
makes interesting comments that usually
reflect the majority opinion of the commit-
tee.

Jeff Edwards — The law school may be
isolated way down at Lewis Hall, but it is
well represented on the Executive Com-
mittee. Edwards is one of the most vocal
and hard-working members of the com-
mittee who is not only concerned with af-
fairs having to do with the law school, but
also in matters of importance to
undergraduates. He was instrumental in
The Ring-tum Phi, January 22, 1981, Page 7

 

lysis Of The 1980-81 Executive Committee |

exposing many problems that have oc-
curred due to the lack of adequate security

~d is eager to ensure that the entire stu-
dent body, including the law school, has
proper security. During the discussions
about security, Edwards made certain
that the problems faced by law students
were included.

Edwards also figured prominently i in the
EC’s attempt to review the constitution,
co-authoring eleven amendment proposals
with Marshall Clark. Although the motions
failed to pass (not enough students voted),
Edwards’ efforts were not diminished and
he, along with other members, is still
working hard to make the changes that he
says are necessary to bring the constitu-
tion up to date.

Although Edwards’ influence on the EC
is strong, he is always willing to listen to
the other members who both concur and
disagree with him. His arguments are per-
suasive, he is constantly aware of the im-
portant and obscure issues which abound
at W&L and he is not afraid to raise them
with the committee.

Jim Vines — Without a doubt, this senior
is the most controversial, conservative
and hard-nosed member of the EC. He is
never afraid to say what he believes and is
willing to go out further on the limb than
anyone else. Much of the time he is in the

ERIC MYERS
minority on issues that committee votes
“n, but he cannot be intimidated and never
allows a proposal to come to a vote until he
has made his point.

After the eleven proposals that would
have amended the constitution had failed
because too few students voted, Vines mo-
tioned at a meeting to allow two-thirds of
the committee members to amend the con-
stitution instead of students. This was a
radical and controversial proposal that
failed. Only Vines voted in favor of it.
Although it would have put all the power in
the hands of the EC and was not the most
democratic method of amending the con-
stitution, Vines’ motion made a lot of
sense. Nobody else on the committee
would ever consider going as far as Vines
did and more often than not, his sugges-
tions are too much for others to swallow.
But he does not make proposals and argue

at meetings because it’s fun. Vines is —

serious about his position and won't let
anybody, not even his fellow ‘“‘legislators’’
intimidate him.

Vines always questions those who ap-
pear before the committee with sub-
committee reports and requests for
money. He wants to know where the
money is going before it leaves the EC’s
control. He never fails to offer his own sug-
gestions for doing things differently.
Although he is not the most likable
member of the EC, he is dedicated to his
work and not afraid to challenge even the
most popular opinion.

Marshall Clark — Like Edwards, this
senior member of the committee is hard

 

working and never afraid to air his opi-
nions on important issues. He always has
something to say but is not always in
agreement with the majority opinion of the
committee. On the security issue, he was
the first and only EC member who
demanded that President Huntley issue a
statement on university security.

Clark concerns himself with all issues.
With Edwards, he co-authored the eleven
proposed amendments to the constitution.
He is constantly quizzing the heads of the
many subcommittees who are required to
appear before the committee, asking them
about expenditures, operating procedures
and future plans. He was a member of the
fact-finding committee which examined
alcohol abuse at W&L and also is in-
terested in a similar committee to in-
vestigate drug abuse. He gets involved;
when he isn’t questioning or talking at a
meeting, he is listening. Clark can be
tough with both students and university of-
ficials. But he hears and understands both
sides of most issues and never fails to
speak his mind.

Michael Nogay — The second law school
representative on the committee, is also a
newcomer to the EC. He has only been a
member since early November and has
been somewhat overshadowed by Ed-
wards, the elder statesman of the commit-
tee. But Nogay contributes his personal
Opinions at Monday night meetings and
seems particularly concerned about com-
plaints from law students. He was very
vocal on the security question, telling the
committee about numerous complaints
from law students concerning the lack of
lighting on the Wilson Field bridge ann

 

TRIPP BROWER

Davidson Park, where many law students
live, He is aware of the attitudes of law
students and is always ready to speak-up
for them.

Nogay also made several suggestions
concerning the election of first year law
and freshman members to the EC, suppor-
ting run-offs as a means of determining
winners of the elections.

There is room at EC meetings for more
input from Nogay. As he becomes more
familiar and comfortable in his role on the
committee, he will probably contribute

more of his opinions. The law school is well
represented from, both Edwards and
Nogay.

Eric Myers — Although he is one of the
more soft-spoken members of the commit-
tee, Myers is always ready to challenge
other EC members or chairmen of the sub-
committees. He wants answers and ex-
planations and is not content until he
understands completely what the issues
are and what’s at stake. He is not afraid to

amined this controversial issue. :

Myers’ no-nonsense approach to his
responsibilities as a member of the Ex-
ecutive Committee, combined with his
ability to refrain from speaking during the
heat of battles which sometimes occur on
Monday nights, is often deceiving to the
casual observer. Myers could say more,
But when he talks, people listen, and it’s
then easy to see that this junior member of
the EC is definitely an important part of
the committee.

Frank Smith — This sophomore member
of the EC usually concurs with the majori-
ty opinion of the committee and rarely
votes against proposals which ultimately
reflect the EC’s attitude. Although he does
not participate in discussions as much as
other members of the committee, Smith’s
comments are useful and necessary. He

. participated in the fact-finding committee

— along with Clark and Myers — that in-
vestigated alcohol abuse at W&L, and he is
often willing to serve on the numerous
committees which the EC sets-up to ex-
amine problems at the university. Smith is
a conscientious and dedicated member of
the committee.

Peter Baumgaertner — Like Smith, this
sophomore rarely finds himself in
disagreement with the majority of the
committee. His comments, although not as
frequent as Smith’s, usually reinforce an
opinion of other EC members. Baumgaert-
ner is capable of either bringing an issue
before the committee or offering sugges-
tions on issues introduced by other com-
mittee members. Unfortunately he does
not do this often enough. His opinions are

as valuable as those of other commitee
members. There is room in the next five
months for more contribution by
Baumgaertner.

Tripp Brower — There is very little that
can or should be said about this junior
member of the committee. Since the first
meeting of the year in September, Brower
has said almost nothing. Although he has
yet to miss a weekly meeting and he
always votes on matters that require com-
mittee approval, his input into committee
discussions is negligible. Perhaps his in-
volvement in the muscular dystrophy
dance marathon prevents him from
dedicating more time to the committee.

Ben Hale — It. would be unfair to judge
this freshman member of the committee
on his record to date since he has only been
on the EC since early November. But he
has exhibited some positive qualities as a

/new member, especially as an ear and

voice for the freshman class. In the past,

 

BEN HALE

the freshman class has been ignored, or at
least placed on the back burner, ‘‘to be
considered later.’’ But Hale has often
brought up matters of particular interest
and importance to the freshman class at
EC meetings. His concern about the man-
ner in which freshman elections are held
resulted in important changes and he ap-
pears to have a sincere interest in becom-
ing a real spokesman for the freshman
class.

A Look At:

Gary Fallon’s Playing Years

Note: This is the first in a
series of articles by Sports
Editor Ralph Frasca.

Several issues ago I wrote a
short piece on the distinct spar-
sity of W&L athletes who have
gone on to grace or trammel the
playing fields of the profes-
sional ranks. This paucity does
not, however, lend itself to the
rugged souls who constitute the
Physical Education  depart-
ment. Although none have ever
been remembered as bona fide
luminaries in the annals of pro-
fessional sports, five (Fallon,
Lyles, Emmer, McHenry, and
Williams) have grabbed at the
mythical brass ring of success
in a world of big men who get
paid to play little boy’s games.

Gary Fallon played college
football at Syracuse University,
when that school was in its
gridiron heyday. Fallon was a
two-way player during the
twilight years of that anti-
quated ‘‘old -school’’ style of
play, seeing action at fullback
on offense and linebacker on
defense.

‘‘We had some great teams at
Syracuse during the late 1950’s
and early 1960’s,"’ W&L’s foot-
ball coach recalls. ‘‘I played in
the same backfield as with one
of the greatest running backs
ever- Ernie Davis. That man
was amazing.”

Syracuse won the national
championship in 1959, and

many players on that team
became highly coveted by the
pros, particularly with the
emergence of the American
Football League in 1960. Com-
petition between the NFL and
AFL soon became fierce, as

both leagues fervently sought to
obtain the best talent available.

“I was pursued by teams in
both leagues, but the two which

showed the most interest were
the New York Giants of the
NFL, and the Dallas Cowboys of
the AFL. Being from New York,
I wanted to go with the Giants,
who were a great team back
then.”’

However, the Minnesota Vik-
ings, a second-year NFL expan-
sion club, drafted Fallon in the
12th round. Head Coach Norm
Van Brocklin, on the lookout for
running backs, saw Fallon play
in the Liberty Bowl and envi-
sioned him as a workhorse
fullback. Fallon respected Van
Brocklin, a reknowned quarter-
back of days gone by, but found
him to bea harsh taskmaster.

“The rookies and free agents
had to report to training camp a
week before the veterans, and
we were put through the most
rigorous workouts we had ever
experienced. It was like a meat
market, and it was all we could
do tosurvive.”’

When the veterans arrived,
the rookies thought that prac-
tices would ease up, but this
was not the case.

Van Brocklin was just as
tough on respected veterans
like Hugh McElhenny and Mel
Triplett as he was on us. The
funny thing is that McElhenny,
a former teammate of Van
Brocklin, said that Norm was
very slack during his playing
days, often scrimmaging in ber-
muda shorts. You see, back
when Van Brocklin played, the
defense wasn’t allowed to touch
the quarterback in practice.

Wrestlers Go Tonight

by John Harrison

At a point in which team suc-
cess will be marginal, the
Washington and Lee wrestling
team has found that its
schedule, in addition to some
bad breaks, will prevent the
situation from getting much
better.

Having recently lost three
members who quit the team,
W&L is presently in the middle
of the most demanding part of
its schedule, hosting two mat-
ches and a tournament in less
that four days. After the Lyn-
chburg meet last night, the
Generals square off against
Richmond tonight at 7:30 on.

On Saturday the team must
get up fairly early in order to
prepare for the 11 a.m. start of
the day-long W&L invitational.
The field includes three
Virginia schools (Hampden-
Sydney, Longwood and Lyn-
chburg), and four more from
North Carolina (Davidson,
Elon, Pfieffer and Catawba).
Then it’s on to Hampden-
Sydney for a match against the
Tigers next Tuesday.

In the aftermath of leaving
the team, junior Mike McFad-

den has decided to serve as an
assistant to coach Gary Franke.
His responsibilities include
overseeing the practices and
giving pointer to the team dur-
ing meets. Coach Franke ex-
plained, ‘‘Mike feels that he still
has a responsibility to the team.
I don’t believe he wanted to let
us down.”’

Fallon fended off stiff com-
petition and made the Vikings
as a crack special-teams player
and reserve fullback in the
backfield of a young quarter-
back named Fran Tarkenton.

“*Tark was a brilliant quarter-
back. Only in his 2nd year, he
had the poise of a veteran. Van
Brocklin let him run the of-
fense, which is rare for a
sophomore’ quarterback,
especially ona young team.”

Fallon was used sparingly in
1962, seeing occasional action
as a blocking and short-yardage
back on a team which was
almost exclusively comprised
of rookies and over-the-hill
stars of the previous decade.

“IT was forced to give 100%

with the Vikings because they

 

were always looking to replace
people. Every week I'd see new
faces in the locker room. It was
a pressure-filled situation in
which I was never made to feel
secure. I liked playing under
those conditions.”’

He was not invited back for
the following Season. Coach
Van Brocklin told Fallon that he
lacked speed, but praised him
for his gung-ho attitude and hus-
tle.

“T never had any delusions
about my ability,” Fallon
remarked. ‘I knew that I was a
fringe player, and it was just a
matter of time before I would
get cut.”

Fallon tried out for the Jets,
but found them overstocked in
running backs. Waiting for

Sports

another crack at the big time,
Fallon played semipro ball until
the Hamilton Tiger Cats of the
Canadian Football League sign-
ed him mid-way through the
1963 season.

They later released him, but
Fallon latched on with the
Toronto Argonauts, another
CFL team, largely due to the
recommendation of his ex-
coach, Norm Van Brocklin.

From 1965 to 1967, Fallon
played for several minor league
football teams, the last of which
was the Scranton(Pa.) Miners.

“The Miners were a farm
team of the New York Giants.
During the day I taught high
school, and at night I played
football.

“In 1968, the team moved to
New York City and became
much stricter in terms of prac-
tices. They wanted total com-
mittment from me, but I
couldn’t give it because of my
teaching position.”’

Fallon eventually landed a
coaching job at Princeton,
where he spent six years.

“‘Due to circumstances which
developed at Princeton, I felt it
was time to look for another job.
I had coached against Jack Em-
mer in the past, and knew that
he was at Washington and Lee.
The football head coaching posi-
_tion was open, and Jack recom-
mended that I interview for it.”’

Athletic Director Bill
McHenry was vacating the
post, which worried Fallon.

“I was afraid that Bill, my
boss and the outgoing coach,
would constantly second-guess
me. Fortunately, that has not
been the case. He’s been great,
and lets me run the team my
way,” Fallon said.

Fallon recalled these anec-
dotes.

The Cowboys played the Vik-
ings in a scrimmage game, and
I was at fullback. We ran a pass
play in which I was to block
their middle linebacker, Jerry
Tubbs, if he rushed for the
quarterback. If he laid back, I
was to look for someone else to
block. Well, on the play he
didn’t charge, so I started look-

ing to pick up another defender. |
As soon as I turned, though, he
rushed in and nailed our
quarterback. Van _ Brocklin
really chewed me out for that
one! He sent me back in later,
when we were running the exact
same play. Determined not to
be folled, I watched for Tubbs,
He wasn’t coming. But as I
started to turn, I saw him
charge out of the corner of my
eye. I turned back and tackled
him. Tubbs was furious, but I
told him, ‘Hey, I just got chew-
ed out because of you, and I
wasn’t going to let you fool me
again.’ ‘In the pros, they don’t
care how you do your job, just
that you do it.”’

During the mid-1960’s, Fallon
played in the Syracuse U. Alum-
ni football game, against the
varsity, where he faced a young
fullback named Larry Csonka.

“I was playing linebacker in
that game, and at one point
Csonka broke loose running
down the sideline, and I was the
last defender in his path to the
goal line. Csonka wasn’t very
agile, he just tried to run over
defenders. Well, I managed to
tackle him around the legs,
Csonka was hopping mad, and
he remembered me for that.

“At the alumni game the
following year, Csonka and I
found ourselves in the exact
same situation — a one-on-one
in which I was the only one in
his way to a touchdown. Csonka
had developed a little head fake
since our last meeting, which
faked me out of my socks and
had me leaning the other way.
Seeing that I was off-balance,
Csonka ran over me and scored
the touchdown.”

Fallon, head coach at W&L
since 1978, holds a great deal of
respect for his ballplayers.

‘‘None of my boys are pro pro-
spects, and they get little
recognition for their
achievments on the football
field. I respect the fact that they
play because they want to, not
because they have to because of
an athletic scholarship.”

Next week- Jack Emmer and the
New York Jets.

Swim Team Loses Two Meets

by Phil Murray
The Washington and Lee
swimming team was defeated
twice last weekend, losing to
James Madison University on
Friday, 60-43, and Towson State
University, 74-38, the following

day.
While both schools compete in
Division I, Coach Page

Remillard did not believe that
either team had better swim-
mers than the Generals. “Their
people simply swam a lot better
on those days,” remarked the
second-year aquatics director.
In fact, several W&L swim-
mers turned in season high

marks but were beaten by
outstanding performances by
the JMU and Towson athletes.

Freshman Tim Rock con-
tinued his remarkable success
with the best dual meet times in
the 200-yd freestyle in the
Madison meet and in the 599-
and 1000-yd free against
Towson.

Versatile co-captain Herb
Gresens clocked a_ personal
high in the 200-yd fly versus
Towson, while Eric Peterson
earned a personal best as well
in the 50-yd free.

One of the most pleasant sur-

prises for coach Remillard this
season has been the performace
of freshman diver Richard
Rosser. ‘‘Richard has provided
us with strength we didn’t know
we had.”

But Remillard was quick to
give credit to diving coach-
JoAnn Jordan who has turned
Rosser into a top competitor
after she discovered him diving
recreationally at W&L. Rosser

finished first in the 3-meter dive
and second in the 1-meter dive

against Towson.

Remillard was not discourag-
ed by the defeats, which drop-

ped the dual meet record to 2-3.

A lack of depth has forced the
Generals to place more em-
phasis on individual achieve-
ment than team success.
Several swimmers have
already qualified for the NCAA
Division III Championships to
be held March 19-21 in Oberlin,
Ohio.

The Generals will host their
final home meet Saturday at 2
p.m. against Shepherd College
in the Cy Twombly pool. Coach
Remillard hopes to see a lot of
support for W&L’s fine swim-
ming team. As an added attrac-
tion, the Sweetbriar swim team
will face the Shepherd women.

Generals Pull Upset

contests he has started this
season, netting 22 points in the
Emory & Henry game and 17
points in the Generals’ 93-79 win
over Bridgewater on Jan. 17.
Still, New did not put together
his most impressive perfor-
mance until Tuesday night.
New led his team with a game-
high 26 points against Roanoke,
including 14 in the first half, as
WA&L struggled to a 39-32 deficit.
“In the first half, we didn’t
follow our game plan,”’ stressed
Canfield. ‘In the second half,
we followed it beautifully. In the
first half on offense, we would
beat the press but then let up. In
the second half, we would at
tack after beating the press.”
“Defensively, we kept them
to outside shots,” continued the
coach, ‘‘and didn’t allow them

to get into the middle.”
The second half statistics for
W&L are incredible. The

Generals shot 74 percent from
the field, scoring on 32 of 41
second half possessions At one
point, W&L scored on 15
straight possessions. And

is W&L’s second-half point total

Senior center Rob Smither-
man scored 22 points and grabb-
ed nine rebounds while junior
guard George Spears pumped
in 19 points and handed off ten
assists. Senior co-captain Carby
Hoy added 14 points for the
Generals.

Said Canfield: ‘“‘We are not
playing with a great bench; we
are basically relying on five
players. But while I can’t single
out any one player, Spears’ free
throws down the line were
critical. At that point, our oppo-
nent was not Roanoke but the
clock.”’

On the night, Spears hit 13 of
14 free throw attempts.

Asked if his team was peak-
ing now, Canfield replied that
his team has been playing well
the entire month. Canfield said
he hopes to avoid that problem,
adding: “I would fight any
signs of peaking this early.”

The Generals will face
another major test tonight when
they travel to Lynchburg to
take on the Hornets. Gametime
is 8 p.m. at Lynchburg College.

An Insider’s Guide To:

W&L’s Fencing Program

by Leigh Kaplan
Sports Editor’s note: Leigh
Kaplan is a sophomore fencer for

WEL.

A sport rarely mentioned on
campus is the W&L fencing
team. Few have more than a
layman’s_ knowledge of the

sport, fewer still have attended
a fencing meet. Hence, this in-

troductory article, in the same

vein as Ralph Frasca’s piece
earlier in the year.

Fencing existed at W&L
throughout the twentieth cen-
tury, but did not gain pro-
minence until 1941, when Tad
Humphries, now Fencing Coach
at VMI, was captain of the
team. In 1943, the team
dissolved due to the World War
II draft. Afterwards, various at-
tempts to reorganize a fencing
team failed until 1977, when a
serious and successful attempt
was made by Dr. Jim Worth,
W&L’s Psychological Adviser.

Worth’s desire to resurrect
the team stems from a genuine
desire to teach the art of fencing
and introduce the sport to in-
terested students. Dr. Worth
commented, “Fencing has a
swashbuckling quality, a
romantic aspect which at the
same time is quite aggressive.
Worth went on to say that he
liked fencing for its one-on-one
competition and emphasized
the fact that skill instead of
physical strength is requisite
for the sport. Analyzing fencing
in-depth, Dr. Worth feels the
sport ‘‘teaches winning, mental
discipline, courage, and ego
development. To sum it up, one
learns to compete.”

Worth offered an interesting
reaction to the nagging con-
troversy surrounding the pro-
spect of fencing entering the
ranks of varsity sports.

“T would like to try varsity

. Status,’”’ Worth remarked.
‘Although it would give up our
autonomy, we would have the
benefits and notoriety which ac-
company a varsity sport.”

Unless the fencing
achieves recognition,

team
some

team members fear dissolution
is imminent, particularly when
one considers

the sparse

    
  

It is time to place
your orders for
caps, gowns and

freshman crop of swordsmen.
Team captain Bill Sherwin
commented, ‘‘The team’s
chances for survival are good,
but we've got to recruit.

Recruiting is essential.’’

Asked how he would try to
recruit, Sherwin remarked,
‘“‘We need to present a fencing
exhibition before the student
body to illustrate the  in-
tricacies, quickness, concentra-
tion, and actual excitement in-
volved in this sport. If people
are interested, they should sign
up and try it out to see if they

"ike it. Another thing that might

help is to put up a few more
posters, advertise on radio. In
essence, we need a_ broad
publicity base.”’

Student sentiment regarding
the fencing team proved in-
teresting. One student with
whom. one shouldn’t ‘“‘mintz’’
words growled, ‘The fencing
team gets too much money
from the E.C.”’ Another student
commented, ‘‘Before I came to
W&L, I had never seen a fenc-
ing meet. I knew little about the
sport. For instance, I did not
know that such divisions as foil,
epee, or sabre existed.’’ One
freshmen said, ‘‘I would rather
see the fencing team remain in-
dependent than to become a
varsity sport. The fencers enjoy.
a certain freedom that varsity
status can not offer. For in-
stance, the ‘‘competitive edge”’
coaches look for in athletes
comes out naturally, instead of
from fear of being cut from the
team.”’

A number of students praised
the fact that muscle is not a fac-
tor in fencing, as opposed to vir-

at W&L. Rather, agility is the:
requisite attribute in fencing, a
fact that makes the sport so ap-
pealing to those who feel that
muscles do not necessarily
denote athletic prowess.

In fencing, three weapons are
used: epee, foil, and sabre. In
epee, accuracy is most impor-
tant; foil requires movement;
sabre mandates quickness.
Skills needed in all three
weapons are among others, con-
centration and proper form.
The object of the sport is to hit
the opponent five times within a
certain time limit. All fencing
must be done within a boundary
called a “‘fencing strip.” If one
strays outside of the fencing
strip three times, a point penal-
ty must be called.

When questioned about the
team’s prospects this season,
Bill Sherwin said, ‘‘We did beat
U.Va. for the first time since
our team’s inception in 1977, but
we should not anticipate an
easy time or an obvious win
against such upcoming op-
ponents as George Mason and
William and Mary.”’ Bill quick-
ly pointed out that, “‘On a good
day, we can beat anyone. Much
depends on mental attitude.”’

The W&L fencing team will
meet VMI and VPI at the lat-
ter’s school.

The Generals take on Duke
and George Mason on Feb. 7 at
VMI, starting time 1:00. Final-
ly, the Virginia State Cham-
pionships will be held at W&L
on Feb. 21. Dave Hepler, W&L’s
reigning state champion in epee
fencing will defend his title
against the state’s best fencers.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Dart Guns?

“The Killer Game”’ It’s hard not to be sarcastic
when we talk about a game in which people stalk
around shooting at one another with dart guns — all
for a cash prize. Though it sounds like something
from the gong show, there are posters all over cam-
pus advertising ‘‘the Killer Game”’ with the endorse-
ment for fairness that the honor system applies to the
playing of the game. The statement understandably

raised a few eyebrows on the Executive Committee -

and was the subject of considerable discussion during
the EC’s Monday night meeting.

Like the EC, we wonder why it was necessary for
the honor system to be mentioned at all. The Honor
System should pervade all aspects of student life at
Washington and Lee, so it really is not necessary to
mention that honor applies to the playing of a dart
game. Saying the honor system applies in this in-
stance almost infers that it does not apply in other
situations. The game is trivial and foolish, and for
that reason it does not seem right for a poster adver-
tising the game to endorse itself with the honor

system.

The EC was in a bad spot in that it was hard to say
that the system does not apply, yet it seemed absurd
to say that it does apply. We applaud the decision
reachedSimply to not get involved — and hope that in
the future the system will receive more respect.

January 20

Tuesday, January 20, will certainly go down in the
history books as a big day in American history — how
many countries in the world could change leaders and
end an international crisis on the same day? It may
sound corny, but we should pause and reflect on just
how good we have it as Americans, and how lucky we

are to be spending four years at a fairly peaceful
school.

You Can't
Keep A Good

Man Down

Dear Editor:

Poor Mr. Johnson! It’s a
credit to him that he was able to
win a Rhodes in spite of
Washington and Lee. The lesson
is clear: Not even W&L,
“‘violently’’ opposed to research
as it is (violently?) and hiring
liars to work in the admissions
office, can keep a truly good
man down. What he forgot to
mention is how the administra-
tion also wouldn’t let him
transfer out when he discovered
all this.

Sincerely,
Bob Keefe

‘77 Rhode

   

s Scholar

Responds To Johnson

Dear Editor:

As a 1978 graduate of
Washington and Lee and a 1977
recipient of a Rhodes Scholar-
ship, I would like to respond to
your interview with Ed
Johnson.

Treasurer Explains
Phantom Accounts

Dear Editor:

I would like to make a few ex-
planatory comments regarding
your January 16 story on mid-
term reports. I was not able to
attend the meeting because my
fraternity held elections that
night.

My purpose in drafting the
midyear report was primarily
to present receipts and expen-
ditures since the last report,
since I felt a complete review of
all transactions to date would
be both time-wasting and

redundant. I did include an ac- .

counting of total expenditures
of each account to date. The EC
ad-hoc member to the SAB con-
curred with me on this, but un-
fortunately, this was not
brought out at the meeting.
Therefore, the failure to list
receipts from one of our films,
which had appeared on the
previous report.

Regarding the drawing of
funds from apparently ‘‘emp-
ty” accounts: according to EC
Vice-President Willie Mackie,
standard procedure has been to
deposit EC funds into one
account and the SAB has been
free to allocate funds as it

wishes among its four accounts.
The writing of checks from
three accounts shows up as a
negative balance on the Univer-
sity’s accounting system,
balanced out, however, by the
single large deposit. Mackie
merely wished to insure that we
had allocated funds among the
accounts, since he has no other
way to verify this other than
directly questioning the SAB, I
would like to note, however,
that the amount we have
allocated for each account ap-
pears on every budget report.
Although I can understand
EC President Bob Willis’ con-
cern about financial review; in
the case of the SAB, every
transaction made appears on
our monthly report, although
minute items are often com-
bined for expediency. I would
be perfectly happy to let the EC
examine our books, if it wishes,
as I am Satisfied as to the ac-
curacy of our records and their
correlation to our monthly
report.
Sincerely,
Larry Wescott
Treasurer
Student Activities Board

First of all, I hope that many
of his comments were either
misquoted or distorted, I first
met him a week ago and he
seemed to be not only very
bright but also very nice. But if
his remarks were not taken out
of context, a strong reply is in
order.

I would term my liberal arts
education at W&L particularly
in History, German, Sociology
and Art as first-rate. In fact, I
believe that my education at
W&L was better than the one I
received from Oxford. For a
small, private university we
need not apologize to anyone for
our faculty, facilities, course
selection, or our student body.

Sure, there are areas in which
W&L could improve and every
man is entitled to his opinion on
this subject. But one also owes a
debt to the university which
gave him both his training and
the backing to win a prestigious
post-graduate scholarship. In
short, not only must a man be
incredibly lucky to win a
Rhodes but he also must apply
out of an institution which has
the required prestige ' and
recognition.

Harvard sends over 150 ap-
plicants a year into the Rhodes
competition. W&L does not even
send a fraction of that number
in five years of competition.
Yet, W&L has won four Rhodes
Scholarships in the past nine
years. No other comparable
school in the U.S. has done bet-
ter. It would seem; then, that
Washington and Lee must be
doing something right.

Yours most respectfully,
Mark A. Bradley ’78
‘Killer

Game’

Dear Editor:

Okay, I understand that the
“Ist Annual W&L Killer Game”’
is just that — a game. However,
it pains me to think that such an
activity could reduce our
awareness of the lives lost
because of the senseless use of
handguns. Thousands of people
in the U.S., including such
talents as John Lennon and Dr.
Michael Halberstam, were
shooting victims in 1980. There
is little chance of handgun con-
trol legislation in the new Con-
gress, but we could at least
begin to recognize the menace
of handguns by refraining from
the ‘Killer Game.”’

Johnson Article, Editorial Criticized

Dear Editor:

After reading the editorial in
last week’s edition of the Ring-
tum Phi, I was tempted to write
to each of the Rhodes Scholar-
ship committees in the nation in
order to inform them that they
wasted their time rigorously
assessing the qualifications of
each of this year’s Rhodes
Scholarship applicants. The
committees merely should have
forwarded all applications to
John G. Billmyre, the editor-in-
chief of the Ring-tum Phi. It
seems that via some unknown
process Mr. Billmyre is able to
determine just who is and who
is not ‘Rhodes Scholarship
material.”

Needless to say at this point, I
was not very pleased with the
tone of Mr. Billmyre’s editorial.
Nor was I pleased with Mr.
Whalen’s story about Ed
Johnson. I must admit that Ed
Johnson will never make a fine
diplomat (or even a mediocre
one); however, I must assert
that Mr. Whalen’s unfairness
both in what he chose to print
and in what he chose not to
print.

First, I question why Mr.

ae

GE EE LE IT LS LD ITO LE FF MF MF LL LL

Whalen believes that Mr.
Johnson’s office on the first
floor of Parmly Hall is isolated
from the university. It is, after
all, located less than fifty yards
from the new library, which is
supposedly the center of cam-
pus intellectual life. That Mr.
Whalen believes the office to be
“isolated from the rest of the
university” indicates that he
has certain prejudices concern-
ing which persons and places
contribute most to campus life.
Perhaps he allowed those pre-
judices to influence his repor-
ting.

Second, Mr. Johnson and I
discussed the story the day it
appeared in the Phi. In our con-
versation, Mr. Johnson told me
that in many instances Mr.
Whalen had paraphrased his
comments rather than quoted
them. Moreover, it seems that
Mr. Whalen was guilty of omit-
ting some rather important
points that Mr. Johnson made. I
will complete one quotation of
which only a portion was includ-
ed in the Phi: ‘‘...] was taken in
by all the liberal arts bullsh-t

—and I still am.” The fact that
Mr. Whalen chose not to com-

plete the quotation suggests to
me that he was more interested

_in sensational reporting than in

accurate reporting.

Third, Rhodes Scholars do not
attend Cambridge. They attend
Oxford. (Mr. Johnson, in fact,
gave his interviewer a pam-
phlet about Oxford.) Further-
more, Mr. Johnson is not from
Natchez, Alabama as reported
by Mr. Whalen; he is from
Huntsville. It seems that Mr.
Whalen only bothered to listen
to Mr. Johnson when something
that might provide sensationa!
print for the Phi was being
discussed.

I would like to add one final
comment. My opinions concern-
ing W&L and life in general are
vastly different from Mr.
Johnson’s. However, I
recognize that he is an extreme-
ly intelligent, knowledgeable
person; one who is perhaps
capable of making a significant
contribution to physics. Ap-
parently, the members of the
Rhodes Scholarship commit-

tees that interviewed Mr.
Johnson agree with me.

Sincerely,

Paul Bourdon

Editor’s note
Mr. Bourdon picked up two

points which | missed while
editing Bill) Whalen’s interview
with Ed Johnson. One, Johnson
lives on Natchez Drive in Hunts-
ville, Alabama, though he lists his
home address in the student
directory as Lexington. Second,
Johnson will study Physics at Ox-
ford, not Cambridge.

However, | stand behind Bill
Whalen’s article 100 percent and
would like to point out that-
Johnson did not make the state-
ment, “Twas taken in by all the
liberal arts bull-sh--t--and 1 still
am,” in his interview with Bill
Whalen. He may have wished that
he made that comment after the
interview, but Bill Whalen’s notes
show clearly that he did not
paraphrase Johnson and that he
followed his notes accurately. In
fact, Whalen’s story represents
well the comments Johnson made.
Whalen did include
some of the most: embarassing
comments: our Rhodes’ Scholar
made, In conelusion Td like to
add a quip printed in the Wall
Street Journal last year: “Most of
the people who claim to have been

nol

misquoted are merely sorry they
said it,”

The Band
Plays On?

Dear Sir,

This letter is adressed to
Jamie Small, one of the men in
charge of our student activities
board. Weren't the busboys sup-
posed to play in the Cockpit
from 8 til 10 on Tuesday night?
Click, Click. Some of us really
wanted to see them at 8; we
made plans one it, counted on
it; and no delivery. So, while I
sat and drank for the two hours
you caused me to waste, I was
treated to the sight of the band
drinking right behind me. I
guess they were waiting for a
crowd, huh? |

Lastly, contrary to your state-
ment announcing the change in
the schedule of the show, I don’t
think I got any more for my
money than I would have gotten
had the show gone on as you
advertised. The whole thing
really sucked wind. And I ran
out of beer money as a result.
Fortunately the band was well
worth the wait. We would like to

see them again; on time.
Signed,
