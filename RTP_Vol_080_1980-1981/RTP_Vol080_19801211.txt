Keydets Raid Fraternity

Students Attacked, Rooms Ransacked

 

G. Gordon Liddy

Critique, Recap

 

The Sphinx Speaks

by Markham Shaw Pyle

G. Gordon Liddy, renowned
equally for his part in the
Watergate scandal and his
ability to eat anything on his
plate, gave an SRO Lee Chapel
audience a forceful yet disarm-
ing address on his experiences
and his world view Monday
night.

The former FBI agent and
Nixon Administration ‘‘fixer’’
claims the problems facing
America today are not the
result of a spiritual malaise, but
rather of growing, increasingly
obvious inferiorities vis-a-vis
our ‘enemy — not ‘adversary,’
enemy,” the Soviet Union. Lid-
dy sees America as a
euphemistic, a dreaming socie-
ty. We have, he says, forgotten
as a nation that our position is
unique, our good fortune un-
paralleled; and because we
have forgotten, we expect
everyone else to be as comfor-
table, as secure, and as eager
for a peace that would preserve
their position. The ex-
intelligence operative accuses

the country and its leaders of
confusing the real world with
the world for which we hope.
“The world,’’ says G. Gordon
Liddy, ‘‘is a very bad
neighborhood — at two in the
morning.’’

Three Washington and Lee
sophomores and a student from
Hollins College were attacked
Saturday night when cadets
from the Virginia Military In-
stitute raided the Phi Kappa
Sigma fraternity.

Steve Jones, Tad Renner and
Ross Lynde, all members of Phi
Kappa Sigma, and Lynde’s
date, were watching television
in a third-floor room of the
house while cadets apparently
entered through a door on the
first floor. The four people were
alone in the house at the time
because the rest of the fraterni-
ty was attending a Christmas
party at the Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon house.

According to Phi Kap Presi-
dent Rob Brooke, the cadets
trashed parts of the house’s
first floor and then proceeded to

EC Claims Unnamed
Fraternity Slipped

Drugs In Drinks

By Mike Perry

Executive Committee Presi-
dent Bob Willis read a prepared
statement to fraternity
presidents and Intrafraternity
Council representatives at
Tuesday night’s meeting in
which he condemned the ac-
tions alleged by a ‘‘friend’’ of
the university ‘‘that a
Washington and Lee student
gave a guest at a fraternity par-
ty a beverage containing a

 

“only

hallacinagenic drug.”’

Willis further stated ‘‘the
guest drank the beverage
unaware of its contents. Conse-
quently, this person experienc-
ed both social and academic
problems which culminated in
the individual's withdrawal
from school."

The EC President explained
later that he spoke to the IFC
because the incident supposedly
occured at a fraternity party
and that ‘‘the Committee is not
asking any person or organiza-
tion to take any action with
respect to this particular of-
fense.’’ Willis added that ‘‘the
Committee has reason to
believe that this was not an
isolated incident.”

noted that the subject was not
discussed in any open EC
meetings. Willis added that

are discussed in closed

‘could have been discussed”’ as
an honor related offense. Willis
also said the incident involved
“a deceitful action.”

countered the group watching a
basketball game on television.
Upon running into the W&L
students, one of the cadets ap-
parently grabbed a fire ex-
tinguisher and sprayed the
group.

Brooke said he returned to the
house at 10:45 p.m. and noticed
that a first floor telephone had
been ripped off of the wall and
his own room had been ransack-
ed (including a seven-foot shelf
tipped over), heard a girl's
scream coming from the third

floor and called the police from
the phone in his room.

Brooke then raced upstairs
and saw the three Phi Kaps and
the one girl involved in a strug-
gle with the cadets. Brooke and
the three Phi Kaps followed the
cadets down to the second floor,
where more damage was done.
One of the cadets apparently
dumped a combination of
detergent and Jack Daniel's
whiskey into an aquarium, kill-
ing all the fish inside the tank.

Keefe Reflects On
W&L Experience

by Will Jackson

Robert S. Keefe began his
association with Washington
and Lee in 1964 as a freshman.
Two years after graduation he
was back, in the role of W&L’s
news director, a a post he’ 8 held
Paty years.

Now Keefe is leaving. Why?

It's not because he has
developed a grudge against the
school, or just gotten tired of it,
he is quick to point out. “T wish
there was SARE HING I hated
about W&L — jt would make it
so much easier to leave,”’ he
says. He's just looking for a
challenge.

That challenge will lie in his
new job, as an editor for
McKinsey & Co., a large inter-
national management con-
sulting firm — as ‘‘dramatical-
ly different’ a situation, Keefe
said, as he thought he ‘could

 

cope with." Keefe is not a
stranger to dramatically dif-
ferent situations.

After graduating from W&L
with a major in Political
Scietice and History, Keefe took
a year of graduate work in the
same beat ‘vandernit
year which squelched his desire
to become a political science
teacher. Keefe headed back to
his hometown, Milford, Ct., and
began work as a City Hall
reporter for the Milford Citizen,
a newspaper which was then in
the precess of going from week-
ly to daily circulation, for which
Keefe had spent summers
working during college. :

Those golden retrievers sit-
ting in front of the library or sit-
ting behind Washington Hall
may become a thing of the past
if the university has its way
next week.

At a meeting on Monday,
President Robert E.R. Huntley

noted that unleashed dogs are
making life on the Colonnade

hazardous for the average
traveler. Staring this Monday,
the university will bring the
local dog warden to the campus
with the purpose of taking away
any unleashed doggies.
According to University
Treasurer E. Stewart Epley,
the current dog problem is
nothing unique to this school.
Epley said that a dog warden
was brought in in 1976, after
another series of dog mishaps.
Epley noted that the dog
warden will definitely make an
appearance on Monday and
might possibly return on Tues-
day, depending on what he cat-
ches. Any dog found on campus,
wandering around without a
leash, will be considered fair
game by the warden.
To save your dog, Epley said
that the poochie needs a leash,

Tournament Preempts

by Frank Billingsley

Hopes for a large-scale con-
cert the Thursday night before
Fancy Dress have been aban-
doned by the Student Activities
Board because Warner-
Doremus Gym will not be
available.

The W&L athletic department
has rented the facility to Lex-
ington High School, which will
be hosting the Blue Ridge
District High School Basketball
Tournament. Dick Miller,
Associate director of athletics,
said the department contracted
with the high school last Oc-
tober and “there is no way I feel
I could cancel the tournament
when they booked the gym so
far in advance.”

However, Miller is working to
get the gym for the Thursday

and should be under control,
—be it by the owner, a tree, or a
building. The first fine for not
having a leash will be $5. After
the first incident, all fines will
go up an additional $5, with a
maximum penalty of $25. All
unleashed dogs will be taken to
the local Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals.

Epley listed a few examples
of the problem of unleashed
dogs, including:

-Last week, two dogs had a
fight inside Washington Hall.
-On Monday, an unleashed

night, said SAB Co-chairman
Jamie Smail.

Miller said the SAB approach-
ed him with the requests only
last week. Co-chairman Pryse
Elam confirmed that the SAB
only began ‘tossing around the
idea’ prior to Thanksgiving
vacation. Elam _ said, ‘We
thought. that three months ad-
vance (notice) would be
enough, and University basket-
ball ends on that Thursday.”’

Elam said he agreed with
Miller in that the contract
should not be broken but “‘in the
future, the gym should be for
the University first and the
local community  second.”’
Elam added, ‘‘We’re disap-
pointed, but will continue in the
tradition of the Pavillion.”’

The athletic department does

-Again on Monday, two dogs

frequent Washington Hall).

Liddy Discusses Trial

by Markham Shaw Pyle

According to G. Gordon Lid-
dy, the press is afraid to report
the irregularities he claims
were allowed or created by
Judge John J. Sirica in Liddy’s
trial. The following is Liddy’s
account of the trial, much of
which cannot be checked due to
the sealing of the records of the
court.

During the selection of the
jurors, the defense asked cer-
tain prospective jurors about
their exposure to pre-trial
publicity. Judge Sirica, ‘the
anointed saint of the media,”
refused to accept such exposure
as grounds for disqualification
and pushed the process of selec-
tion through to a rapid conclu-
sion. As a result, 11 of the 12
jurors had not been individually
interrogated.

Five of Liddy’s six co-
defendants switched their plea
to guilty mid-way through the
trial. The jury, sequestered
since the trial began, was told of
their decision in such a way as
not to affect the changes of the
remaining two defendants.
However, one juror was caught
talking to his wife in violation of
the orders of sequestration. He
was immediately replaced by
the alternate chosen for such

Fancy Dress Concert

have an agreement with the Ex-
ecutive Committee and Univer-
sity Council not to rent the gym
out locally more than twice a
year.

Elam did say that the
Pavillion has been procured for
the Thursday before Fancy
Dress although the SAB will
sponsor a party rather than a
concert. He said, ‘‘We have to
find a band that will play out
there and there aren’t too
many. We’re looking at some
substantially scaled down

bands for that night, possibly
Bruce Hornsby or Robin

Thompson.”” Elam noted the
recurring vroblem of proper
facilities for large-scale con-
certs and productions. ‘The
gym is not made for this type
function, the dining hall only

holds 600 people, and the
Pavillion holds less than that
—crammed in.” Many bands
refuse to play at the Pavillion
because they consider it ‘se-
cond rate.”’

Elam said the SAB is in no
political position to work for a
new facility. He said the idea
was presented last spring and
‘went down in flames.” Elam
said that the faculty saw the
idea as just another place for
students to have parties.

Elam suggested that there is
an all-around need for a new
facility. One, he said, that could
be used for concerts, Contact
speakers, theatre productions,
and so on. “We’re really in no
position to bring it back up
again, but we won’t stop ask-
ing,” Elam said.

   

eventualities, and to salvage a
potential mistrial, Sirica inter-
rogated the remaining jurors on
the record. It soon transpired
that one juror spoke only
Spanish. The judge struck the
interrogations from the record
and forced the trial to an end
with the bilingual jury. Liddy
was convicted and sentenced to
21 years in prison, a sentence
Sirica justified by falsifying
Liddy’s record. Due to a
typographical error, the record
was changed on the copy
published in the main, body of
397 Federal Supplements, but
not in the appended transcripts.
The discrepancy is a matter of
record.

Police Chief Urges Students To Lock Up For The Holidays

by Toit Baker

Besides having to worry
about studying for exams and
getting rides home, students at
Washington and Lee must
figure out how to avoid being
victims over Christmas break
of the usual wave of robberies
that occurs over holidays.

The escalating number of
burglaries and robberies that
has plagued the Lexington area
has made it evident that
students should take steps to
secure their valuables.

Charles Murray, the Univer-
sity proctor, made _ several

. gested

recommendations for students
in the dormitories as well as
students living in town. Murray
suggests that students living in
the dorms should put their
valuables in their closet and
lock it up. Also, remember to
lock the door to the room. The
side doors to the dormitories
are also locked by the janitors
after all students have left.

For students living in frater-
nity houses and apartments
around Lexington, Murray sug-
that they find the
strongest room with the
securest lock in the house and

put all thé Hose Valuables in
that room. Also, nail shut all the
windows to the house.

Chief James A. Kirby of the
Lexington Police Department
also suggested that -students
pool their valuables in one cen-
tral location and have someone
watch it over the break. Kirby
also said that taking valuables
home over break would be a
good idea. Locking or covering
up the valuables with a blanket
or box could also prevent theft.

A student can also prevent
thefts with such long-term pro-
jects as recording serial

numbers and renting a marking
gun and putting social security
numbers on valuables.

Both Murray and Kirby stress
that, regardless of all the
precautions the student takes, if
a thief wants to steal something
badly enough, he will find a way
of breaking into a student’s
room or apartment.

To avoid this problem, Mur-
ray recommended a security
service operated by Francis G.
Watts. Watts has a warehouse
under the Campus Corner and,
for a fee of $30 dollars, will take
students’ stereos, radios, televi-

sions, cameras, guns, and
whatever else they want to keep
secure. Watts is insured, licens-
ed, and sanctioned by the
police. Also, this $30 dollars
covers not only Christmas
break but also winter, spring,
and summer breaks.

Finally, Kirby and Murray
both stress that people besides
the student body at Washington
and Lee read the Ring-tum Phi
and these same people will
know how students are protec-
ting their goods.

Soon after freshmen arrive at
Washington and Lee, they are
told everything from how to get
to Sweet Briar to the location of
restrooms in the Commerce
School, says Junior Executive
Committee Representative
Eric Myers. But he adds, ‘‘they
should also learn about
alcohol.”

A concern about alcohol-
related problems, coupled with
a Ring-tum Phi article on the
subject, prompted Myers ‘‘to
make a motion to start a com-
mittee whose purpose would be
to look into the drinking pat-
terns and alcohol abuse at
W&L,” he says

After several weeks of resear-
ching alcohol education pro-
grams, Myers decided to try
starting a W&L chapter of BAC-
CHUS (Boost Alcohol Con-
sciousness Concerning the
Health of University Students).
The organization, which
originated in Florida’s state
university system, “‘is the first
of its kind in terms of a college-

Liddy: The Sphinx Speaks - And W&L Listens

(continued from page 1)

Liddy’s view of America’s
position in that world is not en-
couraging. He sees an America
crippled by regulation of its
economy and its intelligence
agencies; an America whose
dreams are the prelude to a
harsh awakening. According to
Liddy, the highly complex US
Army is staffed by mental defi-
cients; he foresees a draft. Our
Navy is vastly outnumbered by
that of the Soviets, and the
USSR ‘‘is not producing such
craft to protect the Baltic
fishing fleet.’’ The republic is
outclassed in the air, outfoxed
on the ground, and out-
numbered on the high seas, and
Liddy expects disaster.

 

oriented organization that em-
phasizes alcohol awareness,”’
Myers said.

An indication of the organiza-
tion’s purpose, said Myers, is
found a BACCHUS publication
which quotes L.S. Mullin in the
Journal of School Health:
“When alcohol information is
presented in a non-judgmental,
accurate fashion, students
would have a better background
for which they could make
responsible decisions.”’

“I’m pretty strongly in favor
of initiating a BACCHUS
chapter here, said Myers. ‘I’ve
gotten a great deal of interest
and support from both students
and the admininstration.”’

Such an organization would

be an alcohol-awareness group.
Myers emphasized that it would
have no moral or religious over-
tones, thus seperating it from
many other alcohol programs.
Also, BACCHUS, unlike similar
groups, is a preventative effort,
not a treatment-oriented group
such asAlcoholics Anonymous.

After his diagnosis of the na-
tion’s present difficulties, Liddy
outlined his career: in In-
telligence, in the Executive
Branch, and in the Federal
Penitentiary System — though
he calls the last a misnomer, as
he cannot recali having met any
truly penitent prisoners.
Recruited into Intelligence in
Korea, Liddy was kept on stand-
by until shortly after the end of
the Korean War, when he was
brought into the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

By the time he was 29, Liddy
had been seconded to the FBI’s
Front Office in Washington,
D.C., where he worked with the
late J. Edgar Hoover. He
retired from public life to prac-

The basic goal of the
organization is ‘responsible
drinking through knowing what
alcohol can do,’’said Myers. As
an example of irresponsible
drinking abundant today,
Myers cites the finding that
drinking-related accidents are
the leading cause of death
among college students.

“This type of organization is
something that has a place at
any school where anyone
drinks,” he said. “It’s almost
embarassing that Hampden-
Sydney is way far ahead of us in
tthis regard (alcohol awareness
}programs).”’

Myers said that BACCHUS
would have to begin on a small
scale, concentrating on
freshmen through their dorm
counselors. -

Myers labeled dorm
counselors the “‘main, obvious

vehicle to promote alcohol
awareness.”’ Many of them
have already supported the
idea, Myers said.

Yet he sees an effect of the
organization possibly causing

tice law in Manhattan with his
father, but became so disgusted
with the New Left of the late
1960’s that he became involved
with Republican Party politics.
Having distinguished himself as
assistant prosecutor in Dutch-
ess County, New York, he was
persuaded to run for Congress.
While his bid was unsuccessful,
his campaign attracted the at-
tention of John Mitchell, who
promised Liddy a post in
Washington if he would work for
Richard Nixon’s_ election.
Within the year, Liddy found
himself back in the Capitol as
special assistant at the
Treasury Department.

Liddy became involved in a
succession of quasi-legal ac-

changes in policy regarding
drinking at university social
events.

Students will by surveyed
next term in an effort to deter-
mine what their drinking habits
are. A possible result of this,
said Myers, might be that at
future SAB events, non-
alcoholic beverages may be
served.

Myers said the expenses are
small, but he hopes for financial
support from the university.
Myers claims he already has
the support of Dr. James Worth,
the university psychologist, and
Dean H. Robert Huntley, who
has agreed to be the group’s ad-
ministration sponsor.

Myers noted that a BACCHUS
chapter at W&L ‘‘would not be
as intense’ as those at some

schools. Florida State Univer-
siny, for example, has salaried
professional alcohol counselors.
The W&L chapter would take a
passive role, Myers said, by try-
ing to use part of freshmen
orientation period to distribute
materials and hold workshops

tivities on behalf of the Ad-
ministration, culminating in the
Watergate break-ins of May/
June 1972. He justifies his

Christmas Film Offerings

by John Wells

Hollywood is gearing up for
its annual barrage of Christmas
releases, praying for a hit and
remembering disasters of
seasons past. If you live near a
metropolitan area you can see
most of these over the holidays,
if not, wait and catch them in
the Big Lex come April.

Last year the emphasis was
on sci-fi with Star Trek and The
Black Hole the major big
budget offerings in that
category. This year there
seems to be more comedy even
though the major star-studded
$40-million 1941 was the major
bomb last Christmas.

Buck Henry, who has a
number of prominent film
credits in addition to his many
Saturday Night Live ap-
pearances, directs Gilda
Radner, Bob Newhart and
Madeline Kahn in First Family.
Kahn and Newhart play the
president and first lady with
Radner as their daughter in the
political satire which is
Warner’s holiday biggie.
Richard Benjamin’s in it, too,
and all these funny people
should be able to turn out
something worthwhile.

Paramount and Walt Disney
Productions have joined forces
and spent §$20-million on a
musical version of the cartoon
favorite Popeye, directed by
Robert Altman. Robin Williams
and Shelly Duvall co-star as
Popeye and Olive Oyl, with Ray
Walston as Pappy, Paul Dooley
as Wimpy and Paul L. Smith,
who grossed out millions as the
sadistic ape-like guard in
Midnight Express, as Bluto.
Altman hasn’t had a commer-
cial success since M*A*S*H or a
critical one since Nashville.

Honefully the film will be better
than the wooden clip shown last

month on the Tonight Show. I,

for one, will be disappointed if
Duvall/Oyl’s neck, arms and
legs don’t stretch to’ extraor-
dinary lengths like in the old
Max Fleisher cartoons.

Stir Crazy is a reunion for
Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor
after having been teamed in
Silver Streak with popular
results. The ‘‘story’’ according
to the advertisements deals

with the two zanies dressing up
like woodpeckers, getting fram-
ed for bank robbery and being
thrown in the hoosegow.
Directed by Sidney Poitier and
filmed before Pryor’s
celebrated drug fire last June.
Nine to Five features four
major attractions, Jane Fonda,
Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton,
in a comedy about secretaries
and, with Fonda’s name on it,

‘about sexism, of course. This is

Fonda’s first picture since last
year’s Electric Cowboy,

Private Benjamin, and one
would think the poster artists
would do her better justice in
the newspaper ads. If her name
hadn’t been printed with the
picture in the Sunday New York
Times, she’d have been a dead
ringer for Tammy Wynette. The
score is by everybody’s favorite
composer and talk show per-
sonality, Marvin Hamlisch.

The Mirror Crack’d is the
latest in the all-star Agatha
Christie period pieces. Instead
of Hercule Poirot, the detective

 

Shelley Duvil plays Olive Oyl to Robin William's Popeye in the
Robert Altman picture scheduled to open this week, Popeye.

Tomlin’s first since the
disastrous Moment by Moment,
and Dolly’s first, period. The
clip shown on the Carson show,
by the way, was extremely fun-

ny.

Chevy Chase and Goldie
Hawn are together again in the
Neil Simon comedy Seems Like
Old Times, from the play by
Neil Simon. Charles Grodin,
who with Bruce Dern has filled
the “discarded lover”’ slot left
by Ralph Bellamy and Gig
Young, is again typecast. Col-
umbia, reuniting Wilder and
Pryor, would like to repeat the
Chase-Hawn success of Foul
Play. Comedienne Hawn is
riding a wave of popularity with

in Murder on the Orient Ex-
press and Death on the Nile, the
sleuth is another Christie
favorite, Miss Marple, played
by Angela Lansbury, Her
characterization should be
quite different from Margaret
Rutheford’s Marple in the early
1960’s films. The setting is Lon-
don during the 1953 coronation;
Rock Hudson costars with. two
of his leading ladies from way
back when, Kim Novak and
Virginia’s own Elizabeth
Taylor. Novak and Taylor
should be amusing as two aging
film queens making a movie
together and bitching, bitching.

Be selective. At $4 to $5 a shot,
it pays to be choosy,

—J/, Lennon, Oct, 1980

Late in the evening on December 8th, after a
session at the Record Plant, a Manhattan recor-
ding studio, John Lennon and Yoko Ono returned
to their 72nd Street apartment, The Dakota. Less
than one minute after debarking from the
limousine, Lennon lay face down in a pool of blood,
shot four times with a .38 caliber pistol. Police
rushed him to nearby Roosevelt Hospital, where
despite the attempts of many doctors. to
resuscitate him, he was dead on arrival. Lennon's
assailant, Mark David Chapman, himself and
avowed Beatle fan and a one-time guitar player in
a rock and roll band, was arrested almost im-
mediately afterward.

John Lennon was born on October 9th, 1940 in
Liverpool, England. Neither of his parents was
willing to care for him, so his aunt and uncle, also
from Liverpool, took him into their home. Lennon
met Paul McCartney at a church social in 1956.
Two years later they formed a band called the
Quarrymen, and took on George Harrison as lead
guitarist. The Quarrymen broke up, and the
regrouped as the Moondogs. They later became
the Silver Beatles, who got their name from
manager Alan Williams’ nickname for Lennon —
Long John Silver. In 1960, after numerous
engagements in Liverpool's famous Cavern Club,
the Silver Beatles went to Hamburg. Here they
honed their talents by playing eight-hour gigs
every night at the Indra Club. Months later, they
returned to England, became the Beatles, and
rapidly rose to be the top band in Liverpool. In
1962, the same year that Ringo Starr quit Rory
Storme and The Hurricanes to join the Beatles,
John married Cynthia Powell.

The musical story of John Lennon from 1962 to
1970 coincides with that of the Beatles. His per-
sonal life was even more turbulent. After the mis-
quoted remark that the Beatles were ‘Bigger
Than Jesus” had made the headlines, the group,
but John in particular, was anathematized. An
apology helped assuage the public’s ire, but from
then on, there would still be friction between Len-
non and some of the public. In 1966, he met Yoko
Ono at an art exhibit in England. Two years later,
he and Cynthia were divorced, and she took
custody of their only son, Julian. John married
Yoko in 1969, and they have been together ever
since, with the exception of a brief separation in
the mid-seventies, The Beatles officially broke up
in 1971, and each member went his own way, John
backed by the Plastic Ono Band and then
Elephant’s Memory, continued to be musically
prolific until the release of ‘Rock N’ Roll’ in 1975.
He then disappeared from public life until 1980, He
had been bringing up his and Yoko's son Sean,
while Yoko handled the family business. With the
release of ‘‘Double Fantasy”’ this fall, his musical
career appeared once again to be soaring. His own
aspirations and the optimism of his fans concern-
ing his music were quickly crushed by Mark
David Chapman.

Joh Leniiot was & peliilis. His tilisit shows it
now, aid will combine (0 shaw It always. His
lalents, however, were not restricted soley solely
to music. His books In His Quan Write and 1
Spaniard In The Works have been widely acclaim-
ed by the literary world. His acting talent, as
shown in “A Hard Day’s Night”, “Help”,
‘Magical Mystery Tour’, and “How I Won the
War’, was by no means insignificant. Lennon had
a sharp wil, and although it manifested itslef at
times in a sardonic and dynical way, that was not
typical. He was a generous and concerned in-
dividual, who sought to reach people through his
music and help advance peaceful, worthwhile
causes.

Assessing a

Major Loss

 

When the news was broadcast late Monday night
that John Lennon had been gunned down in front
of his Manhattan apartment, a sickening shock
was inflicted on the lives of people throughout the
world. I am one who grew up with the music of the
Beatles.

The passing of ‘‘entertainment giants’’ has been
fairly common in recent years, with obituaries
and accolades for Elvis, Bing, Chaplin and the
Duke. But for ours, the post-Vietnam generation,
the music of Lennon and McCartney wove a
tapestry that through radio became the
background music of our childhood. It wasn’t until
the 1970's that we grew to appreciate the technical
superiority and lyrical significance of the Beatles.
The songs took on new dimensions and helped us
understand the 60's, which we had witnessed
through the tinted glass of our early years.

The much mourned death of Elvis three years
ago was met with a similar reaction associated
with the loss a major cultural figure, but there are
substantial and personal differences. The Beatles
permanently shoved Presley to the back burner
and to our generation he was practically ancient
history. While Elvis is generally credited with the
fusion of country and rhythm and blues, Lennon
brought to the music a unique creativity, wit and
intellectual diversity previously unattained and
still unmatched in style and influence. And the
spectacle of the gaudy, bloated ‘‘King”’ staggering
to his death at age 43 is in sharp contrast to Len-
non’s introspection and devotion to his family as
he entered middle age.

In the past dozen years, most of the major rock
casualties — Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Brian
Jones, Keith Moon, Lowell George — were drug
related deaths. Jim Morrison and Elvis Presley
were the ultimate victims of their excessive
lifestyles. How ironic that Lennon, who has been
credited with introducing American youth to hard
‘drugs (“Luey in the Sky with Diamonds") and who
crusaded in the early 70's for causes of peace and
freedom, died violently at the hand of a lunatic.
This gentle, brilliant man, who had spent the last
five years caring for his small son, reading, and
raising cattle, spent the last seconds of his life
coughing blood up from the bullet holes in his
body.

In recent months, as Lennon emerged from
seclusion to pursue new musical interests, he ap-
peared fairly frequently in the news. The August
recording session, his first since 1975, was follow-
ed by a rare interview in Newsweek magazine. He
had shed his radicalism and traded his famous
eyeglasses for new ones, On October 9, Lennon’s
40th birthday and son Sean's 5th, his wife Yoko
Ono had a skywriter spell out HAPPY BIRTHDAY
in the sky above Central Park West.

Yoko Ono has been the object of intense
criticism from Beatles fans over the years; it was
she who encouraged Lennon to break from the
group in 1970, (he said he’d wanted to quit since
the band stopped touring in 1966), In recent years
she ran the couple's estimated $230 million estate
as he admittedly assumed the role of ‘‘househus-
band’’. Whatever may be said about her enormous
influence on his life, their ‘undying love’’ referred
to by Letinon in ng. caniot be denied. Yoko’s
statetnent followitig Het Husbatd’s death was sad
and siinple: ‘Jolin loved atid prayed for the

uman race. Please pray the same for him.”

The day of John Lennon’s murder had been
unusually warm and balmy for early December.
The following day was appropriately dark and
rainy, a fitting atmosphere for the Lennon tributes
that blared forth on radio stations all day.

A major symbol of the 1960s, a self-described
‘‘peacenik’’, has been killed at a time when the
world is becoming an increasingly unpeaceful and
unstable place. As we contemplate the senseless
tragedy of Lennon's death, we realize how much
his thoughtful presence will be missed in the days
that lie ahead.

Letters To Santa

by Ralph Frasca

As that frenzied, expensive,
but thoroughly enjoyable time
of the year rolls around again
(Feliz Navidad’ for the
benefit of the Spanish depart-
ment, the laws of supply and de-
mand personified for the C-
schoolers, and a much-needed
period of recuperation from ex-
ams for everyone), bewildered
children wander from store to
store in search of the
dehydrated night crawlers that
Uncle Dwight wants so much.
Santa gets his wife into the act,
and the two may be seen cavor-
ting at more department stores
and parades than one would
think possible.

The most interesting aspect
of Christmas is observing the
children. They fret over
whether to put out Fig Newtons
or chocolate chips on Christmas
Eve so that Santa will be in a
good mood to read the
customary “Letter to Santa’’.
However, don’t be deluded into
thinking that small children are
the only ones who write such let-
ters. Oh, no. Doing our usual
thorough investigative research
(undercover, of course), we in
the sports department have ob-
tained a few letters to the
bearded guy from various peo-
ple in the sports world, and
thought you might be in-
terested.

Dear Santa,

We would like to play in a
World Series. We haven’t been
in one since 1945, when all the
best players on the other teams
were off fighting in ‘‘The Big
One,” WW Il. The Phillies
waited 30 years to make it, and
since we've waited 35 years, we
figure that it’s our turn. Of
course, we don’t have half the
talent of Philadelphia, so that is
why we're writing to you. Could
we in ve some pitching, Santa?

And while you’re at it, we need
fielding and hitting and
baserunning and hustle and...
Your favorite perennial
cellar-dwellers,
The Chicago Cubs

Dear Santa,

For Christmas I would like
Ed ‘‘The Mintzer’ Mintz to join
my team. The W&L sports pro-
gram misses his boundless an-
tics (shooting pennies across
the room with his bellybutton,
etc.).

We need the Mintzer, if only
to promote school spirit. We
lack a colorful sports personali-
ty at W&L, goodness knows we
tried to bring back Dash. That’s
why we need the Mintzer. He’s

_our last folklore legend. Fallon

had him for a year, now I want
him.

Sincerely,

A W&L Coach

Hey Santa!

Could I have the heavyweight
crown again? Everyone seems
to have forgotten me,

Yours truly,

Leon ‘‘The
Wonder”’ Spinks

Dear Santa,

I need a football team. A real
one. The kind that wins at least
once in three months. The kind
that doesn’t blow 35-7 leads. The
kind that doesn’t give up
halfway through the season.

One more thing. I keep telling
myself that Halloween is over,
but our fans don’t seem to
realize it. They keep coming to
our games disguisw. as empty
seats.

Sincerely,

The New Orleans Saints Head
Coach

Our own Christmas wish?
That professors aren’t too
sadistic next week, and that you
all have a good break. You
deserve it.

Toothless

by Phil Murray
When Page Remillard was
appointed aquatics director in
May of 1979, he wanted to
rebuild the once strong W&L
swimming program. It didn’t
take him very long.

Coming off a 1-10 record and
placing 32nd in the NCAA,
Remillard has built a fine
nucleus of freshmen and up-
perclassmen which has been
predicted to finish in the top ten

of Division III this year.

~ Swimmer takes off on the first leg

Swimmers Predicted Top Ten

   
 

All-American Swimmer Mike Bernot

Already, the swimming team
has a 1-1 record and finished
first among Division III schools
in the Virginia State Meet. In
addition, five swimmers have
qualified for the Nationals and
Remillard is confident many
others will before the season is
over.

Coach Remillard attributes
this amazing turnaround to two
factors. Of primary
significance is the hard work
and determination of the team

 

 

f a relay event.

members, who come to the pool
every night for at least two
‘hours. The other reason has
been tremendous recruiting
success.

Leadership is provided by
junior co-captains Mike Bernot
and Herb Gresens. Bernot, last
year’s MVP, earned All-
American honors in the 100 and
50 meter freestyle events. This
year, he has already bettered
his lifetime marks in the 200
free and 100 free.

Gresens was last year’s most
improved swimmer and best
distance man. He and Bernot
have already qualified to com-
pete in the Nationals.

Heading the group of new
talent is junior transfer Rob
Crawford, who set two school
records in the 100-meter breast
stroke and 200-meter individual
medley in the first two meets of
the season. Remillard believes
that Crawford ‘“‘could be our

premier swimmer.”’

Other talented newcomers in-
clude freshman Tim Rock,
Kevin Becker, and Jeff Gee.
Rock qualified for the Nationals
by dropping an incredible 40
seconds off his time in the 1650
freestyle within two weeks.

The swimmers are now look-

‘ing forward to a training ses-
sion in Texas over the holidays
in preparation for a home meet
with George Washington U. on
January 9.

Grapplers Off To A Slow Start

by John Harrison
The 1980-81 Washington and
Lee wrestling team faces two
obstacles that head coach Gary
Franke’s past teams have not
had to deal with.

The first is that the team will
not participate in a post-season
tournament. Hampden-Sydney
and Lynchburg Colleges are the
only other Old Dominion
Athletic Conference members
that have managed to sustain
their wrestling programs.

League rules state that fur 4

championship to be held, at
least four schools must com-
pete. When one considers that in
the four previous tournaments
Washington and Lee has cap-
tured first place three times
and finished as the runner-up
the other year, it is not too dif-
ficult to realize that this may
have an effect on the team.

The other problem is a lack of

experience. There are six
newcomers, including four

freshmen. Lacrosse captain
Jerry Broccoli and Barry
Thompson, a two-year starter
for the football team, are the
new upperclass members.
Junior Mike McFadden, who
Shares the captaincy with
senior Dave Stoeffel, has not
been able to lend his experience
on the mat since early last

season, when he sustained a_

knee injury. —
The team’s inexperience took
its toll in the first match, when

George Washington rolled over

W&L 50-0. The Generals later
rallied to defeat Longwood Col-
lege, 32-20. Coach Franke
realizes the team’s predica-
ment, so he is not ready to
panic. ‘Until we get some ex-
perience, which should come in
our matches before the
Christmas break, the team as a
whole will not do very well.
We've definitely got the poten-
tial to do well afterwards,
though.”’

Here is a look at this year’s

roster, with each member’s
weight class in parentheses:
Elbert Umila (118); Scott
Mason (126); Richard
Kopelman (134); Ray Houlihan
(134); Jerry Broccoli (142);

Roundball Works For Better
Execution, Ballhandling

by Dale Park

As the 1980 portion of the
1980-81 season draws to a close,
the Washington and Lee varsity
basketball team is still trying to
develop offensive consistency.

On Wednesday, December 2,
poor execution and sloppy ball-
handling resulted in a disap-
pointing 57-55 loss to Hampden-
Sydney on the Tiger’s home
court.

“It was just one of those
games,’’ commented head
coach Verne Canfield. ‘‘We had
several balls knocked away
from us, threw some passes
away and had a couple of our
shots blocked. On offense,
everyone was waiting for
everyone else to do the job.”’

Although holding Hampden-
Sydney to 38 percent shooting
from the field, W&L had only
two players in double figures;
junior guard Clark New scored
a team high 14 points and senior
co-captain Carby Hoy netted 11.
The game was the first ODAC
contest of the year for the
Generals. ;

On Friday, December 8, the
Generals hosted Lehman Col-
lege from Bronx, New York.
Against Lehman, the Generals
offense began to improve as
W&L erased a ten-point deficit
early in the second half and
coasted to a 56-44 win.

“Against Lehman we began
to reduce the number of times
we got the ball but were unable
to take a shot. We also began to
increase the amount of time
within which we could play sus-
tained defense,” Canfield said.

Defense has been the

Generals’ strong point so far

 

this season, and the Lehman
game was a good example;
W&L held Lehman to only 14
points in the entire second half,
and committed no shooting
fouls.

Offensively, the Generals got
a big lift from Hoy, who led all
scorers with 20 points, while the
other starting seniors, center
Rob Smitherman and senior co-
captain R.J. Scaggs, con-
tributed ten points apiece.

Last Monday the Generals
had their hands full, hosting the
Randolph-Macon Yellow-
jackets, the 10th-ranked Divi-
sion II team in the country. The
Generals trailed by twelve at
the half (52-40) and were behind
by as much as 25 points with on-
ly seven minutes left to play.
Yet an incredible surge, led
mostly by young W&L players
off the bench, cut the deficit to
only nine points with two
minutes left. This was as close
to the Generals were to come,
however, as the Yellowjackets
held on to win, 97-88.

“I am proud of the way our
young: players performed,”
stated Canfield. ‘They forced
Macon to keep their starters in
until the end of the game.”

Throughout the game the
Randolph-Macon offense
devastated the Generals, both
from the inside and outside.

Canfield noted “Our blue

‘team (the starting five) just

didn’t have it. Macon tore us up
inside because we didn’t box
them out.”

On the evening, the Yellow- .

jackets grabbed 49 team re-

bounds as opposed to 29 for the
Generals.

Yet while the Generals
managed to tighten up inside
defensively in the second half,
the R-MC sharpshooters hit an
incredible 69 percent from the
floor in the second period to
keep the game out of W&L’s
reach.

“It’s pretty tough to beat a
team that shot like Macon,”
remarked Canfield. “Yet we
came back from 25 points down
to nine points down, and that
shows something.”

Spearheading the W&L come-
back were three freshmen and
one junior. The freshmen, John
Graves at forward, and Bill
Yates and Henry Bond at guard
showed a great deal of
quickness and defensive tenaci-
ty, both in melting down a
sizeable lead and in forcing
Macon to stay with its starters.
Clark New, junior guard, came
off the bench to score eight of
his 15 points during the W&L
comeback.

Among the starters, junior
guard George Spears led his
team with 18 points, while Hoy
and sophomore forward Brian
Hansen each added ten points.

“Our blue players had a poor
game,” stated Canfield, ‘‘but
they are still our blue team and
they’ll be ready to go next time.
I scheduled Macon because I
thought playing a tough team
now would help us later. I think
that we’ve learned from this
game and that we’ve taken
another step in the development
of our depth.’”’

Rock Sets
Sights High

By Ed Gonsalves

Exhibiting characteristic
Texas eagerness, Tim Rock
aims to be one of Washington &
Lee’s top swimmers.

The freshman from SanAn-
tonio aspires to become the
NCAA Division III champion in
two events, the 500-yard and the
1650-yard freestyle swims. Two
meets into his W&L career,
Rock has already qulalified to
compete at the Division III
Championship Meet in both
events,

‘Qualifying is something I’ve
worked for,"’ said Rock, adding
that ‘‘subconsciosly, I probably
believed that I couldn’t do it.
But consciously I kept telling
myself I could. It is something a
swimmer shoots for, and now
that I’ve got it I can work hard
without so much pressure.”’

Rock’s goal this year is to
combine with 1980 Division II]
All-America performer and
W&L co-captain Mike Bernot
and place high at all the
freestyle events at the Division
III Championships, set for
March 20-21. Bernot, a junior,
has qualified to compete in the
90, 100, and 200-yard freestyle
events.

Aceording to second-year
coach Page Remillard, W&L,
in the persons of Rock and Ber-
not, could sweep the freestyle
events. ‘Tim is the type of guy
who, if he wants to, can do
anything; his potential is
unlimited," said Remillard.

The caoch adds that Rock's
potential not only lies in swim’
swimmins, but in academics as
well. ‘In my opinion, Tim's big-
gest success has come in the
classroom. He has won the big-
gest battle, adjusting to the day-
to-day pressure of college life."’

The reserved but fun-loving
Rock, nicknamed “Animal” for
his intense discipline and zany
pranks, came to W&L primari-
ly for the academics. ‘The
academic atmosphere is the
reason I'm here at W&L,"’ he
reports. ‘I am very impressed
with the honor code because I
like the principle that
everybody's ideas count. After
attending a high school larger
than W&L, I wanted to go to a
small school. W&L is like a
family for me since everybody
knows everybody else."’

“Tim is one of those in-
dividuals a coach waits a
lifetime for,’’ Remillard siad.
‘However, it seems as if my
whole team this yea year con-
sists of individuals who are

coaches’ dreams."’ The young
W&L team -two juniors, one
sophomore and a handful of
freshmen — is already good
enough to have earned a tenth-
place Division III prediction
form the American Association
of College Swim Coaches.

“Our team is picked to finish
strong because of people like
Tim,” said Remillard. “Now we
just have to work hard to earn
that prediction.”’

Making A Name

Supreme Court Justice Lewis
Powell. NBC newscaster Roger
Mudd. Virginia Senator John
Warner. This trio would make
for pretty impressive dinner
guests, huh? These dignitaries
once walked the hallowed halls
of W&L, desperately searching
for that elusive passport to a
decent job — higher education.

‘Well, what about luminous
sports figures,’’ one might ask.
Alas, there you have me. Our
school is notable for turning out
Southern gentlemen, hardcore
preppies, and generally suc-
cessful people, but W&L men
are a scarce commodity in pro-
fessional sports.

within five minutes of his call.

The cadets, who said they had

at Spanky’s, were hostile to the
police according to several eye-
witnesses and refused to be
taken into custody. Several eye-

police charged one of the cadets
with assault and two others on
counts of interfering with the
duties of a police officer and
resisting arrest.

Richard E. Collier, Jr., a se-
cond classman, was charged on

one count of assault with a fire ~

extinguisher and two counts of
disorderly conduct and
resisting arrest. Derle ‘“‘Gray”’
Hagwood, also a_ second
classman, was charged on one
count of interfering with the
duties of a policeman and one
count of resisting arrest.
Thomas N. O’Sullivan, again a
second classman, was charged
on one count of interfering with
the duties of a policeman.

The case was scheduled to be
heard Tuesday in General
District Court, but both parties
met on Monday afternoon and
decided to drop the assault
charge if the cadets agreed to
pay for damages occurred in
the raid. An official at VMI also
promised that the cadets would
be “‘strictly punished.”’

In Tuesday’s trial, the three
cadets each received fines from
Judge Joseph Hess. Collier was
fined $200. ($100 apiece for the
disorderly conduct and
resisting arrest charges) in ad-
dition to court costs. Hagwood

was likewise fined $200 for his
two offenses, while O’Sullivan
was fined $100 for his one of-
fense,

Collier and O'Sullivan both
entered the Phi Kap house on
Saturday night, while Hagwood
became involved in the incident
when it moved onto Washington
St.

In addition to the fines, the
three cadets received a stern
lecture from Judge Hess, who
warned that the practice of go-
ing down to a fraternity house
and “cleaning it out’? must be
stopped. Hess said that such
anti-social behavior on the part

of the cadets is detrimental not
only to the relation between
W&L and VMI, but the com-
munity as a whole.

The cadets were considering
filing brutality charges against
the Lexington police force, but
testimony by both the arresting
officers and four eye-witnesses
convinced Hess that the police
tactics were not unnecessarily
rough. The cadets had claimed
that the officers’ supposed use
of flashlights or nightsticks was
unnecessary.

The cadets, now that all
criminal charges have been
completed, face disciplinaty ac-
tion by their school.

Tucker Renovation Is
Nearing Completion

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s $1.1-million renovation of
Tucker Hall is running accor-
ding to plan, Frank Parsons,
Assistant to the President, told

the Ring-tum Phi.

According to Parsons, one
and a half floors of the former
law building are being
renovated and remodeled to ac-
commodate the university’s
psychology department and
computer center.

The project is being under-
taken essentially in two phases.

ft TARAASAAARAAAaTRaAVaaaaaeeaasaaay

Special orders and suggestions welcome

In the first, the old library
reading room, which occupied
the back half of Tucker Hall’s
main floor, is being readied to
house the computer and a se-
cond level is being added in the
middle of the room to provide
offices and classrooms for the
psychology department.

He said that the computer
center, now operating in tem-
porary quarters in the back
part of the Tucker basement,
will move upstairs to its perma-
nent location over the
Christmas holidays.

Maintenance Plan Draws Mixed Reviews

by Bill Whalen

After only three months in
operation, the fraternity
maintenance plan devised by
last year’s Ad Hoc Committee
on Fraternities is receiving
mixed reviews from the ad-
ministration and the frater-
nities themselves.

“We are tending to be op-
timistic about the plan,” said
President Robert E.R. Huntley.
“‘We’ll have to wait until things
get critical before assessing the
plan’s worth.”

Huntley went on to state that
the plan does possess certain
advantages, including the cen-
tralization of fraternity expen-
ditures and a guarantee of keep-
ing houses at an acceptable
level. But because no deadline
has been placed on the
maintenance program, Huntley
believes the current plan may
not be the final solution, but at
least a framework for future ac-
tion.

“You must remember that on
the economic front, the school is
managing units that are small
and have problems that even

the best management could not .

handle,” said the President.
“Under this program, the
university is providing a cen-
tralized program in which all
the houses have the same ad-

vantages.”’
In a letter sent to fraternity
presidents last summer,

~ Huntley announced that all
W&L fraternities are required
to participate in a maintenance
program under which the
houses are obliged to pay a fee
of $350 a month, or $2800 over an
eight-month period.
“We felt that the program
could only succeed if all houses

acted in the same way,” said:

Huntley. ‘We believed that if
given the choice, some houses:
would choose not to go along
with the plan.”

The fact that all fraternities
were forced into accepting this

plan bothers some of the house
presidents.

“I think the program is a good
idea,” said Phi Delta Theta
President Hill MacAlister, ‘I
believe it was instigated im-
properly, however.’’
MacAlister’s sentiment was
also shared by Sigma Phi Ep-
silon President Chris O’Connor.

“I got my letter in July, but I
don’t -think they (the ad-
ministration) put enough time
into the plan,” said O’Connor.
“It’s hard to gather any opposi-
tion over the summer, and after
rush, the plan was a fait ac-
compli.”

Huntley defended the quality
of his letter, stating that the
decision of the Ad Hoc commit-
tee had been discussed by both
the Interfraternity Council and
the University Council.

“The Board of Trustees has
not discussed the plan yet,”
said Huntley, ‘and they will
ultimately have the final deci-
sion.”

Huntley noted that should the
Board of Trustees vote down the
current maintenance plan, the
overall program will not be
crippled. ‘We have a respon-
sibility to go for a long-range
plan, so we’re looking for
benefits in terms of a few
years,”

Dean of Students Lewis John
believes that the program is
providing immediate benefits,
however. ‘“‘Of the three houses I
recently inspected,” said Dean
John, ‘all had shown signifi-
cant improvement. There have
been noticeable changes in at-
titude and respectability in the
houses.”’ John visits the houses
with the Fraternity Inspection
committee.

Another member of the ad-
ministration who is optimistic
about the program is Buildings
and Grounds Superintendent
James Arthur. ‘‘We’ve been
running into a few problems

and a few fraternities may be
dissatisfied with the work,”
said Arthur, ‘‘but I’m pleased at
this time.”’

Arthur listed two main pro-
blems with the maintenance

-program, including unforeseen

complications with heating
systems and insufficient man-
power. Because the school is
providing only one electrician
and one plumber, some houses
must wait before repairs are
made.

Arthur said most of the
repairs made so far have been
routine (‘‘no heat, no power,
etc.’’). Arthur also said his men
have run into a few problems.
One such problem has occurred
at the Delta Tau Delta house.

At the beginning of this year,
the Delt house arranged to have
a burnt-out exhaust fan
repaired. When the fan was
returned, it worked, but only at
one speed. The university took
over the project and claimed
that a new fan was necessary.
The cost of the new fan was
$174, but it was mot covered
under the monthly maintenance
fee. The Delts must now pay for
the new fan in addition to the
monthly fee.

“The $350 fee covers only
menial repairs,’ said Arthur.
‘Because the fan cost over $10,
and considering the cost for
labor, this must be considered a
major repair.”

Chris O’Connor found similar |
displeasure with the monthly
fee. ‘“‘We’re definitely not get-
ting our money’s worth,” claim-
ed the SPE President. ‘The
men are coming only once a
week, and that’s to do minor
work. Considering that the fee
doesn’t even cover major jobs,
there’s no way you can say the
work is contingent with the
cost.”

O’Connor explained that most
of the work entailed replacing
some faucet sets, rewiring the

boiler and replacing some light
bulbs. “All I can say is we’re
paying $2500 we can better
spend elsewhere,’’ said O’Con-
nor. ‘“This is an example of the
university overspending at the
hands of the fraternities.”

Hill MacAlister, on the other
hand, does not have any objec-
tions with the fee. ‘If you’re a
house working with a budget of
$100,000 and you’re spending on-
ly $300 for maintaining heating,
plumbing and electricity,” said

MacAlister, ‘‘then it’s a good

deal.”’

MacAlister said that his
fraternity was not severely af-
fected by the program, but only
because the Phi Delt house
maintains a separate
maintenance account. “I got
the letter after we had set dues
and house costs for the next
year,” said MacAlister. “I just
don’t know how equitable this
plan is.”

President Huntley said the
maintenance program will not
only be appraised at the end of
this month, but a new cost
evaluation will be made by the
end of the school year. We will
chave a reassessment in hope of

reducing the cost,” said Dean
John, “Next year, we can do
this on an experience basis.”

But O’Connor does not see
how the university can manage
to reduce the cost of the
maintenance program. ‘Con-
sidering the overhead involved,
the cost of the equipment and
the workers, I don’t see how the
program can be cut,’ said
O’Connor. “I don’t see how they
can reduce it enough to make it
worthwhile — it seems like a
waste to me.”’

O’Connor believes that the
university should still require
fraternities to pay the $2800 fee,
but the houses should be able to
acquire their own workers.
O’Connor claims that houses
would therefore be paying only
for mandatory jobs — and the
jobs would be done only on a
need basis. ;

“People are getting upset
with the plan, ‘“ said O’Connor,
“but what can they do when the
university either owns the land
the fraternities are on or hold
the house mortages.”’

O’Connor said that some
houses which did not plan for
the extra maintenance fee,
must now rely on alumni funds
pull or some other fund to main-
tain association with the univer-
sity.
Lamented Hill MacAlister:
“Some houses are really bet-
ween a rock and a hard place.”’

Keete Moves On After Facin

(continued from page 1)

“smorgasbord.”’ Keefe found
that experience valuable later,
especially at W&L where ‘the
diversity of topics of material
that crosses my desk is
unbelievable.”’

When the Citizen’s news
editor was transferred to the
larger Waterbury paper, Keefe,
due to “‘an incredible series of
good coincidences,’’ went
along. At Waterbury he held the
job of Public Relations chief,
but only for about six months.

Then one night, Frank Par-
sons, assistant to W&L’s presi-
dent, telephoned Keefe, telling
him that W&L’s news director
had resigned, and asked
whether he might be interested
in the job. It was a totally unex-
pected offer, Keefe says, and
one that stemmed basicaily
from his work at W&L as head
of switchboard operations for
the school and on the Ring-tum
Phi.

Keefe’s hesitation at taking
the position instantly was due
only to his uncertainty as to
whether he could handle it. The
idea of coming back to W&L
was overwhelmingly appealing,
though, and he took the offer.

Two years after his gradua-

tion, Keefe was back on cam-
pus. Two weeks after that came
the Cambodia riots of 1970, the
first real outburst against the
Vietnamese War seen at W&L.
Reaction to the war before

‘ Keefe’s graduation, he says,

was practically non-existent
Some posters, a few letters to
the Phi, but nothing more.

The Washington Post, in fact,
had written after Richard Nix-
on’s successful Mock Conven-
tion visit to Lexington in 1968,
that the ‘radical contingent at
Washington and Lee could fit in
the back seat of a Volkswagen.”
And, as Keefe explains, the
word “radical” then meant
nothing more than slightly
unorthodox.

Keefe was not quite sure how
to deal with the sudden outburst
of political emotion because, he
said, ‘at W&L we had never
had a_ situation when we
wondered if people would get
out of control.’’ Keefe — ‘more
a kid myself than a
‘bureaucrat’ ’”’ — lucked out.
The greatest unrest blew over
fairly quickly, to be replaced by
sit-ins and more passive forms
of protest.

Even at the height of the con-

flict, Keefe notes, ‘‘no one ever
became uncivil — there was
always at least a common
thread of respect.’’ During this
period,’ the Richmond
newspapers praised W&L’s
forms of protest as being more
productive than the rowdyism
prevalent at the University of
Virginia, for example.

In the fifteen years that Keefe
has known Washington & Lee,
he claims little has changed
—“‘even the music is almost ex-
actly the same’? — except,
perhaps, for a short period in
the early 70’s when there was a
greater fragmentation of the
student body, especially social-
ly, than at any other time in his
experience.

Strangely, that fragmenta-
tion occurred after the Viet-
namese war and, in recent
years, has been almost forgot-
ten in a subsequent return to
traditionalism — a_ tradi-
tionalism that Keefe claims is
now being felt in nearly all
aspects of American society.

In retrospect, Keefe con-
siders his years in Lexington as
practically ideal. He thinks the
style and ease of living
elsewhere will ‘‘never even

Hunting Licenses Selling Too

Well, Game Officer Worried

Sales of the new County Hunt-
ing Licenses have already ex-
ceeded previous fall sales of
county combination licenses,
according to Sam Putt, Game
Commission Administrative Of-
ficer, and this raises concern
that sportsmen may be pur-
chasing them improperly. ‘‘We
have had to reprint these
license books twice already,
after sending agents an initial
supply equivalent to the

number of combination licenses
sold last year,” Putt said.

County Hunting or County
Fishing Licenses are issued on-

purchasing sportsman resides.
Agents have been instructed not
to sell these licenses to non-
residents of the county and
sportsmen who might suc-
cessfully buy such a license in
another county would be sub-
ject to ‘arrest for hunting with

a license for any county in
which they hunt.

The increase in sales of these
licenses seems to be a reaction
to the increase in the fee for a
State hunting license, which in-
creased from $5.00 to $7.50 in
June, At the same time, the
county license was changed
from a $5.00 combination hunt-
ing and fishing license to
separate licenses priced at $3.00

each, Again, these licenses are |

only legally available to
residents of the county in which

remotely approach being as
good as here. This place is real-
ly like Brigadoon,” said Keefe,
“I’m going to miss it very
much.”’

Keefe confesses to a real love
for Lexington, and dismisses
the notion that it is a provincial
town. ‘In a lot of ways,” he
says, “this has been the op-
posite of a small-town ex-
perience in the ‘Petticoat Junc-
tion’ sense.”’

Keefe adds that the variety of
contacts one can make in Lex-
ington, from students to pro-
fessors to townspeople to
trustees, is what make it a vital
community and one that he has
found constantly stimulating.

The working situation at W&L
has been another definite plus,
according to Keefe. Despite his
working for a vested interest,
he said, “‘no one ever tried to
get me to shade things. I doubt
many people are given the
freedom — and the freedom to
exercise it — that I had.”

2 Challenge

While Keefe feels his handling
of the job has become more
refined with time, he notes that
“W&L never tgld me to do
things differently.”

Keefe has seen the job of news
director change over the years.
Hired originally simply as a
writer, Keefe has, in recent
years found his range expan-
ding to include work with the
admissions office and the
university’s art scene. Keefe
expects his successor, Jeffery
G. Hanna, to face a similar
diversity of tasks.

In short, Keefe said, “‘I’ll be
leaving a position with all kinds
of personal security and going
into a world where I’ve had no
experience before.’’ He’s done
that before, of course.

And the excitement of doing it
again seems to be enough to
make him put aside his regrets
at leaving W&L after all these
years.

Pleva Presents Paper
At New York Symposium

Dr. Michael A. Pleva,
associate professor. of
chemistry at Washington and
Lee University, is the co-author
of a paper presented at the
Eastern Analytical Symposium
recently in New York City. The
paper, entitled “A Scientific In-
strumentation Information Net-
work,”’ was written by Pleva
with Dr. Frank A. Settle Jr., a
chemistry professor at Virginia
Military Institute. The sym-
posium attracted more than

6,000 scientists from the New
York metropolitan area.

The two chemists will make
another presentation Dec. 10 at
the Southeastern-Southwestern
regional meeting of the
American Chemical Society in
New Orleans.

Pleva, a member of the W&L
faculty since 1969, received his
B.S. and M.S. degrees from
Trinity College in Connecticut
and his Ph.D. from the Univer-
sity of New Hampshire.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

On the Statement

On Tuesday night Bob Willis delivered a statement
from the Executive Committee to the Interfraternity
Council. The incident dealt with the statement involv-
ing an unnamed fraternity (see story, page 1) accus-
ed of dropping a drug into someone’s drink at a party.

Bob Willis’ announcement raises some important
questions — perhaps the most important is why he
chose to make it.

Granted the conduct of the W&L student alleged to
have been involved was reprehensible and warrants
the ‘‘compelling interest’”’ to the EC. Any yet the EC
has always turned its recognized methods of expres-
sion — statements at open meetings, posted an-
nouncements and letters to newspapers — adequate.
If this act does not constitute an honor code violation,
the EC is bound by the provisions of the White Book to
conduct its business in open meetings and utilize its
standard forms of publicity.

This incident may not in fact be the EC’s business.
The facts as related by Willis suggest that this is a
matter for Student Control and Willis has an obliga-
tion to aid the SCC in conducting its business.

On the other hand, the incident may have come to
light during an honor trial investigation or closed
honor hearing. If this is the case, Willis has com-
promised the confidentiality of an honor hearing. It is
doubtful Willis would do such a thing.

Although Willis is not ‘asking any person or
organization to take any action,” we think students
cannot help but be confused and this organization has

to ask what is going on

Clearly a clarification of this matter is in order.

Transsexual Plans Transfer

- To Washington & Lee

Dear Editor:

Enclosed the text of a letter
sent to the director of admis-
sions at your university. I await
an answer.

Dear sir,

I am presently a freshman at
The University of Chicago and
am interested in applying to
Washington and Lee for my
junior year of college. My
parents are moving South and I
am considering a more
Southern school. A friend of
mine, a student for two years at
W&L, tells me that W&L would
be a perfect school for someone
like me. Unfortunately, my
friend also tells me_ that
Washington and Lee is all-male.

This is my problem:

I, after considerable thought
and counsel, have decided to

UNICEF
Thanks
Skip

Dear Skip: —

Thank you so much for help-
ing with this years UNICEF
drive. The total collections from
Washington and Lee University
and the City of Lexington was
$502.91. A cashiers check has
been mailed to UNICEF Head-
quarters in New York.

Please thank your friends
who helped you in this canvass
and tell them we certainly ap-
preciate their work. Sincerely,

Arthur Beeton
1980 UNICEF Canvass
Chairman

Skip Cross was student
coordinator for the UNICEF drive
at Washington and Lee.

undergo a series of operations
that will alter my sex to that of
a female. I will not undergo
these operations until after
September of 1982: I will then
be a junior in college. In short, I
would like to apply to your
school as a male and then
change sex midway through my
junior year.

I realize that this presents a
serious problem for your admis-
sions staff — could you admit a
qualified (I hold a 3.5 here at
Chicago) student whose sex will
become female after entering
an all-male school? I must
clarify that I will not fully func-
tion as a female, but I will lose
enough male characteristics to
cloud any concept of manliness.
My friend is, however, mad
with enthusiasm as to my ac-
ceptance and says that I would

fit in amazingly well at
Washington and Lee.

I realize the long tradition
W&L maintains as to the sex of
its students and my friend tells
me that W&L will not become
co-ed anytime soon, hence my
chance of getting in has become

~an area of doubt for me. I am a

business major here at Chicago
and would like to- attend W&L
very much.

Needless to say, my fate has
become something of frustra-
tion for me and my family: it is
one reason why I opt to leave
Chicago. Reach me care of my
friend (address enclosed).

Sincerely,
Jefferson Cohen

Spectator:

More Lost In Space

Due to the most wretched and grevious predica-
ment inherent in any publication, a lack of finan-
cial support, ‘Spectator’ was not printed in the
Phi’s Thanksgiving issue. And due to the most
wretched and grevious predicament inherent in
this newspaper, mismanagement and indifference
towards high wisdom, Spectator’s column was lost
and could not be published in last week’s issue.
Horrors, indeed; is this anyway to run a
newspaper? And so to my devoted readers in the
bookstore and elsewhere, I offer you a double
feature to appease your whetted thirst for
knowledge.

When last I left you, Washington and Lee was
preparing to leave the now co-ed, and hence over-
crowded, facilities in Lexington and journey forth
to its new home in the Valley of Eros on the planet
Venus. The preparations went well enough, but the
journey was a disaster.

Due to a small oversight on the part of the
plumbers and electricians (who did such a splen-
did job, at a truly splendid cost, of repairing the
leaking faucets in the leaking fraternities), a key
component of transformer was not installed. When
the students and teachers were beamed up to
Venus, the results were catastrophic. Men were
plagued with female contraptions and ladies were
burdened with male appliances. A truly mix-and-
match affair; no one knew exactly what gender he
or she was. One could say, with appropriate hor-
ror, that Washington and Lee was once again, a
single-sex institution.

More Spectator

At any rate, the community coped as well they
could with what they had. Stimulators were turned
on and the waterbeds were filled up. New faculty
positions were created as the old chairs simply
would not suffice for these changed instructors.
So, too, new courses had to be devised in do-it-
yourself technology. But the sun smiled on these
happy creatures until...the dreaded Martians at-
tacked, and the clouds rolled in.

These dreaded Martians are gooselike creatures
renowned for their rude honkings and devastating
social failures. The lovely garden of Eros was tar-
red and feathered with dung and down; the alarms
and sirens clamored with the dreaded news:

“The social disease is here: The social disease is
here! Run, run for cover.”

But to no avail, for the geese were everywhere,
smothering the campus with their downy cen-
soreds. The head honker started hissing and
squeaked:

“Don’t run away, please don’t run away. We
Martians just want to play. We want to be like the
beautiful people of Washington and Lee!”’

Enter Spectator, your hero. With my shotgun
loaded with wit and humor, I personally wiped out
all the geese (not to mention the infamous Frodo
the Dodo bird). They are reduced to nothing more
than a pile of overly fragrant pate. They are but
feathers in the quill of genius. Or as they say at
Washington and Lee on Venus, ‘‘How would you
like to come back to my place and check out my
goose down comforter.”

A Christmas Carol?

Hark! The herald midwives sing
Glory to the rackdate king!
Piece of *** and parties wild,,
‘Studs and lasses reconciled! ,
Joyful, all of you arise,

Join the triumph of these highs;
With demonic boast proclaim
Your bastard son and his name!
Hark! The herald midwives sing
Glory to the rackdate king!

He, by all the ladies much adored,
Stud, the everlasting party lord;
Long desired behold him come,
Finding, here the frat his home.
Veiled in smoke, a king to see,

Watch him beg you pridelessly.
Pleased as man with dame to dwell.
Stud with flattery, does so well!
Hark! The herald midwives sing
Glory to the rackdate king!

Mild he lets his pride go by,

Born that would never cry,

When he sees her face so queer,
Born to raise the bastards here!
Rising with liquor on their breath,
New snakes chase in lasting quest.
Hail the kings of studliness!

Hail the Prince of Pridelessness!
Hark! The herald midwives sing
Glory to the rackdate king!

University Calls In Dog Warden
To Solve Dog Problem

Dogs on campus are becoming a problem, One jumped a campus
mailman recently. They are going into buildings and making
messes. They are fighting and disrupting classes, and they are
damaging campus plantings.

Dog owners are reminded that Lexington has a strict leash law. It

provides that dogs are not allowed to run at large; they must be
under the control of their owners or custodians by means of leash,
chain, or rope when off the owner's property. Fines ranging from

$5-$25 are prescribed for violations of the ordinance.

Please take notice that the University intends to invite the City
dog warden onto the campus to impound dogs running at large.
Dogs impounded will be taken to the local SPCA shelter where they
will be held until claimed for up to five days. Dogs not claimed after
five days may be disposed of.

EK. Stewart Epley
Treasurer

Trustee Has A Daughter, Too.

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

W&L men will perhaps be especially interested in knowing that
in addition to the three sons named in the article announcing his
election to the Board of Trustees, Mr. Ross Millhiser also has a
daughter, Mary McGue Millhiser.

Cheers ----
Bob Keefe

 

 

More Alumni At Wlur

Dear Editor:

Last week's story about
WLUR-FM contains an error of
fact which I feel needs correc-
tion. The error occurs in the se-
cond sentence of the second
paragraph, on page one.

The entire staff of WLUR is
not, repeat not students.
Besides myself, I know of at
least two other alumni who are
regularly active in broad-
casting over the airwaves of
WLUR. They are Jeff Badgett,
78, who is another unindicted
co-conspirator for the program
‘Russian Roulette’? with
myself and sometimes Mr. de
Maria, and Doug Harwood, ’74,
who has become somewhat of

aii institution with his Saturday
night ‘*Anti-Headache
Machine.”’

Lately I’ve heard a good bit of
griping about the type of pro-
gramming offered by WLUR. I
would remind those people who
are less than happy with the sta-
tion that no one is forcing them
to listen, and that the basic con-
cept underlying WLUR-FM is to
offer an alternative to the trash
which passes itself off as com-
mercial radio in these parts.

Last but not least, thanks for
the pic. I couldn’t have done
better myself.

Sincerely,
W. Patrick Hinely, ’73
