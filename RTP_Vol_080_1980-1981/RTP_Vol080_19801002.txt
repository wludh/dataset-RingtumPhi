Generals’ defense swarms over Emory & Henry’s backs.

Best Start Since I 963

 

Generals Win Again

by Dale Park

Off to a 3-1 start for the first
time since 1963, the Washington
and Lee varsity football team
made it two in a row last Satur-
day by handing Centre College
a 16-9 defeat on the Colonels’
home field.

“It seems that all our hard
work is beginning to pay off,”
said Head Coach Gary Fallon.

Although Centre struck first
on a one-yard scoring play in
the second quarter, the W&L
special-team unit blocked the
point after attempt. Sophomore
tailback Chris Cavalline’s one-
yard touchdown plunge late in
the same quarter and Bill
Devine’s successful extra-point

 

attempt gave the Generals a 7-6

lead.

Executive Committee,

Publications Board Clash

by Cope Moyers

The, Executive Committee
and the Publications Board
clashed Monday night on the
question of whether editors and
business managers of Universi-
ty publications should receive
salaries.

Publication Board President
Channing Hall reported that the
board voted unanimously last
January to pay the editors of
the Ring-tum Phi and Calyx a
salary of 22.5 percent of the
publication’s profits. Business
managers of both publications
were given $150 a year plus 25

percent of the profits.

But members of the Ex-
ecutive Committee questioned
the board’s authority in grant-
ing salaries.

“Article seven, section C (of
the Student Body Constitution),
states that members of the
Publication Board cannot vote
on salaries,” Willie Mackie
said,

Hall said he believed last
January’s vote by the Publica-
tions Board was actually an

for non-fraternity members.
The official statement of the
Board reads, ‘‘It is the opinion
of the SAB that holding Fancy
Dress on Friday night would be
in the best interests of the Stu-

.dent Body, putting entertain-

ment in the Cockpit on Saturday
night would also complete the
Independents’ weekend.”’

The vote wrapped up two
weeks of discussion on the pros
and cons of holding the dance on
either Friday or Saturday

amendment to the board’s con-
stitution.

There could be trouble, how-
ever, determining whether last
year’s vote is actually an
amendment because the
amended constitution is lost and
cannot be located.

“I don’t know if it’s deter-
minable whether it’s an amend-
ment if we can’t find the con-
stitution,’ Hall added.

Hall invited the Executive
Committee to a Publications
Board meeting at 7 pm next
Tuesday in the Calyx office to

‘further discuss the issues. The

student body is also allowed to
attend the meeting.

As the EC meeting progress-
ed, the salary dispute became
less. of an issue between the Ex-
ecutive Committee and
Publications Board. Instead,
the argument centered on the
relationship between the two
organizations.

EC member Jeff Edwards
said it was extremely important
for the Executive Committee to
determine what power it actual-

IFC To Examine Fraternity Report

by Mike Perry

Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent Monte Briscoe urged
fraternity presidents and
representatives to gather feed-
back from fraternity members
on the report recently released
by the Ad Hoc Committee on
Fraternities.

Briscoe termed the report a
“question of survival for frater-
nities’ and encouraged the
fraternity representatives to
report back to the IFC at its
next meeting. Briscoe sug-
gested that such a discussion by

the IFC could lay the ground-
work for an “open campus
forum,” involving faculty,
students and administration of-
ficials, to be sponsored by the
IFC and possibly held in Lee
Chapel.

In other business Briscoe
reiterated the concern of Lex-
ington community members
over the large amount of litter
found in the city’s streets on
weekend mornings following
fraternity evening activities.
Briscoe also suggested that
frtaternities gather com-
parative data on their respec-

tive food services in hope of
eliminating over-spending and
facilitating use of the programs
offered by University Food Ser-
vices Director Jerry Darrell.

The IFC Juducial Board fined
Sigma Chi $150 for a violation of
the IFC’s no-contact rules. In
what Briscoe termed a
‘flagrant violation,” the board
ruled that visits made by a
Sigma Chi sophomore to a
transfer student living in the
Lee House during periods other
than “‘dorm rush” were a viola-
tion of the IFC rush regulation.

ly has over the board.

“‘We may not even have the
power to regulate their
salaries,” said Edwards.

Executive Committee Presi-
dent Bob Willis added that he
was not even sure if the
Publications Board was a
standing committee of the EC.

Willis also said it was
necessary for the Executive
Committee to give the Publica-
tions Board some _indepen-
dence.

“It’s important to keep the
Pub Board autonomous from
the EC,’ he said.

Hall said the issues involved
will require further research
and could take several weeks
before they are resolved.

“Some time needs to be
taken,” said Hall.

In other business, the Ex-
ecutive Committee agreed to
suggest to the Courses and
Degrees Committee that there
be an overhaul of the pass/fail
procedure.

“I think the pass/fail pro-
cedure is really screwed up,”
Willis said.

Willis outlined his ideas for a
re-vamping of the procedure,
stressing the anonymity of
those students enrolled in
pass/fail courses.

He said the names of those
taking a course pass/fail should
not be posted on the colonade or
known to the professor.

Willis also described a

Class Of 84 Boasts Strong Credentials

by Charlie Thompson

According to statistics, the
class of 1984 appears to be bet-
ter qualified than its recent
predecessors. The number of
applicants jumped to 1413, of
which 770 students were ac-
cepted. Of these, 349 or 45.3 per-
cent chose to enroll at W&L.
This confirmation is down about
10 percent from recent years
(78—56 percent). According to
Mr. Van M. Pate, Associate
Director of Admissions, W&L
was competing in a ‘‘faster
track” last year, and the pool of
applicants simply had more op-
tions than in previous years.

The majority of this year’s
freshman class comes from
public high schools (59 percent)
and this is also somewhat dif-
ferent than in past years.
Throughout the 70’s, public and
private schools were repre-
sented almost evenly at
Washington and Lee. Similarly,
60 percent of the public school
students received admission,
while 49 percent of the private
school applicants were admit-

ted. Apparently this is due to
the fact that more self-
screening occurs in_ public
schools. Thus, the bulk of public
school applicants are ranked in
the top fifth of their class,
leading to the higher accep-
tance rate.

Demographically, Virginia
still leads the roll call with 74
students, followed by Texas
represented by 34. The other
states in double figures are
New York (28), Maryland (26),
New Jersey (21), Florida (19),
Pennsylvania (16); North
Carolina (15), Connecticut (12),
Georgia (12), and Tennessee
(12). Texas has the biggest in-
crease in numbers primarily
because of strong alumni con-
tacts and several schools sen-
ding clusters of students — the
St. Mark’s of Dallas School has
8 members in the freshman
class this year.

Sons of alumni submitted 74
applications of which 61 were
accepted, a noticeably higher
rate of 82.4 percent. Other ap-
plicants had an acceptance rate

of 52.2 percent. Mr. Pate admits
that alumni sons face less com-
petition for admission, and in
these cases the admissions of-
fice looks for indications of
“survivability.’’ In other words,
if the applicant would appear to
be able to make it through 4
years here, he will be readily
admitted.

Academically, more than half
of the entering freshmen were
ranked in the top fifth of their
classes; and the mean SAT
scores jumped to 1160 from a
reasonably level plateau of
about 1120 over the last 5 years.
In addition, there are 16
valedictorians and 12 National
Merit Scholarship finalists this
year, notable increases over the
past.

Whether this upsurge in ad-
missions statistics will continue
remains to be seen, but accord-
ing to Mr. Pate; inquiries con-
cerning admissions applica-
tions and information is up by
some 2,000 over the comparable
figures last year.

Theft Suspect Arrested

 

Rape Was Attempted

by J. R. Smith

Results from a rape test per-
formed at Roanoke Memorial
Hospital two weeks ago show
that a Hollins College freshman
was not raped. Lexington Police
Chief James A. Kirby said in a
report Tuesday that an attempt-
ed rape took place on Henry
Street.

Freshman
Caught
Streaking

A Washington and Lee
freshman was convicted in
Buena Vista Circuit Court
Thursday for his part in a
streaking incident at Southern
Seminary Junior College.

Sylvester Miniter, 18, had
been charged with public dis-
play, but pleaded guilty to a
reduced charge of streaking. He
was fined $50.

Miniter was arrested Sept. 15
at 9 p.m., when Buena Vista
police spotted him and another
person streaking on the Sem
campus. The other nude runner
was not caught.

Miniter said the incident was
prompted by a $40 debt, which
he could pay for by streaking.

An arrest has been made in
connection with the reported
theft of a car stereo system
belonging to a Washington and
Lee student.

Charles Russell Smith Jr., 19,
was arrested at 12:15 PM on
Monday and charged with
grand larceny in the theft of an
AM/FM stereo cassette player
valued at $870. Smith is an
employee of Washington and
Lee University.

The theft was reported by
George H. Weatherly Jr., a
W&L freshman, who stated that
the stereo was stolen from his
car parked in the lot on
McLaughlin Street. The report
was filed September 22.

According to the police, addi-
tional charges are pending in
the case. Smith is being held in
Rockbridge Jail on a $3,000
bond.

Two Virginia Military In-
stitute students were arrested
last week for trespassing and
destroying property of the
Stonewall Jackson House on
Washington Street.

Douglas K. Wells and John

rested on September 24 at 10:45
PM for destroying property at

completion of the university’s
$26-million capital fund-raising
objective, to be achieved by the
end of 1981. So far, W&L has
raised $13.5 million against that
goal. In an earlier phase ended
in 1976 of its decade-long
development program, W&L
raised $1.5 million beyond a $36-
million goal.

Sessoms is a 1956 B.A. grad-
uate of Hampden-Sydney Col-
lege who lived in Lexington
previously for three years when
he was sports information
director and athletic business
manager at Virginia Military
Institute. He left those positions
in 1963 to join Williamsburg,
where he was successively a
press bureau staff writer and
manager of broadcast services,
then assistant director of public
relations, and later director of
special events.

He is a former president of
Virginia’s chapter of the Public
Relations Society of America, a
former member of the
Williamsburg-James City Coun-
ty School Board; and a member
of the board of directors of the
Lynchburg Historical Founda-
tion.

The VFIC, of which he is now
associate director, is a fund-
raising consortium of 12 four-
year private liberal-arts col-
leges. In the year just ended, it
raised a record $2,1 million
from more than 1,000 con-
tributors, principally  busi-
nesses and industries with
Virginia operations, represen-
ting a 28 percent increase over
the previous year’s totals. The
VFIC is the most successful
among the 40 or more fund-
raising agencies of its kind in
the nation.

Earl McClanahan, class of ’82, hangs above the Maury River dur-

ing a recent ROTC mountaineering event.

ROTC On The Rocks

On Friday, September 26th,
fifty-seven Washington and Lee

- students and their guests re-

bounded down the VMI cliffs
overlooking the Maury River.
This was hardly a demonstra-
tion of lemming-like mass
suicide nor was it an elaborate
fraternity initiation.

Instead, it was an afternoon
of rappelling, sponsored by the
University’s Military Science
Department. This skill involves
alpine techniques used to scale
and descend cliff faces. Impor-
tance is placed upon secure
knots, rigging, and iron-clad
safety procedures. Many of the
cadets and their guests hurtled
down the rock face with calcu-
lated abandon, while others —
less certain of their moun-
taineering prowess — chose to
make a somewhat more ginger-
ly descent.

A number of the volunteer
mountaineers expressed real
astonishment both that they had
accomplished the seemingly
scary feat as easily as they did,

and that they had enjoyed such
safety in the rappelling.

“Wow, I can’t believe I ac-
tually went through with it!”’
commented Mrs. Debbie Lane
of Lexington, after completing
a surprisingly professional first
descent.

Some cadets in the program,
such as John Fox, class of ’81,
stressed the usefulness of such
training and its application to a
variety of military skills.

‘ccwenenuienanenes
by Will Jackson

The precedent established by
Washington and Lee’s year-old
undergraduate library has been
fulfilled in the completion of its
“new’’ commerce building.

McCormick Hall, W&L’s
library from 1906 to 1979, now
houses the school of Commerce,
Economics and Politics. While
maintaining its time-honored,
columned exterior, McCormick
is virtually a new building in-
side, a model of thoughtful and

efficient renovation.

Almost.

‘Basically we’re very pleas-
ed with the facility,”’ says Dean
Edward C. Atwood, ‘‘but there
are still a few problems.’’ These
problems include delays in the
receipt of some of the building’s
furnishings — tables, desks and
carrels. But, according to Dean
Atwood, ‘“‘the most frustrating
lack

 

i

Workmes add finishing touches to a Commerce School driveway.

is the lack of black-

boards.”

This lack has been noticed in
many cases as professors fight
over the few available portable
blackboards.

The success of the renovation,
Dean Atwood says, “‘is amazing
when you stop to think this was
the library, I don’t think you’ll
find anyone coming into the
building and saying ‘Oh, this is
obviously a conversion.’ ”’

Throughout, the building was
planned with an eye to conven-

 

ience, efficiency and versatili-
ty, as well as preservation of
the building’s original char-
acter. Elaborate woodwork and
mouldings were preserved
wherever possible. All original
windows were retained for

‘natural lighting.

Two spacious auditorium/-
classrooms and an electrical
equipment room command the
building’s central section,

 

  
  

which formerly housed five low-
ceilinged levels of library
stacks. Around this core are
ranged offices, classrooms,

study rooms, a reading room,
and_ student
lounges.
Altogether, the C-school has
three times as much room in
McCormick than in Newcomb
which had housed the

‘Disciple’ Opens This Month

by Markham §S. Pyle

The Irish are coming! Specifically, the late Irish
playwright George Bernard Shaw, whose satire on
life during the American Revolution, The Devil’s
Disciple, opens at the Troubador Theatre October
24th.

Unlike most of Shaw’s plays, which tend to be
staged lectures — rather like Politics 101 at lesser
universities, The Devil’s Disciple is an old-style
melodrama in which Evil gets its Just Desserts,
Good Triumphs, and Young Love Conquers All.
Only Shaw could use these hoary cliches to com-
ment on the nature of Justice and the character of
Revolution. Best of all, the play is witty, fun, and
(a rarity) a vehicle to let us laugh at ourselves.

Director Robert Mogavero quotes Shaw as
labeling the author’s role as ‘‘ ‘sugar-coating. You
make a comment on a social issue and then you
must cover it in comedy so you may present it to
the audience.’ ’’ Mogavero should know: he’s been
guest artist at W&L, Duke, NYU, and the
American Academy of Dramatic Arts. This, mind

you, in addition to his work in Actor’s Equity’s
Equity Library Theatre in New York, The Circle
Off-Broadway, and various upstate New York
summer stock companies. He has surrounded
himself with a professional staff, and is determin-
ed to present Shaw, warts and all. The cast is
drawn from the W&L/Rockbridge Community,
and includes Rick Kukucka as Richard Dudgeon;
Carla Dillon as Mrs. Annie Dudgeon, and Al Gor-
don as British General “Gentleman Johnny”
Burgoyne.

Robert Mogavero’s reasons for staging Disciple
are flattering: in addition to his delight in the pro-
fessionalism of the W&L Drama Department, and
the cast and crew of the play, he feels that Disciple
is especially appropriate to Lexington, where, he
says, “history is still alive.’ In addition,
Mogavero finds this ‘‘encomium to the American
Revolution” freshly applicable in this election
year.

The celebration begins Friday, October 24th.

What the Hell’s a Ring-tum Phi?

___—— Film Notes

Back in the days wnen tele-
phones (all 68 of them in Lex-
ington, an advertisement
boasted) were known as ‘“‘up-to-
date electric call bells,” back
when stealing a_bell-clapper
was called “a naughty-one’s
frolic,” in the same year that
the New York Post conferred on
this city (really) the title
‘Athens of the South” — there
came into being a little
newspaper published weekly,
“by the students for the
Washington and Lee University
community,” and named after
the most popular of that Univer-
sity’s football cheers: ‘‘Ring-
tum Phi.”

“Coincident with the ad-
ministration of President
Wilson begins the career of a
new publication at Washington
and Lee, the Ring-tum Phi. The
Ring-tum Phi is a weekly jour-
nal and presents a pleasing ap-
pearance. It meets a distinct
need in the University and

relieves the Collegian of what
formerly has tended only to clog
and retard.”
Literary Magazine
“The Collegian is primarily a
literary magazine, and when

 

 

Let’s give a rousing,
rumbling, roaring
yell. Ring-tum Phi,
stickeribum...

Football cheer, 1897.

 

 

the editors heretofore were
forced to cram in a limitless
number of locals, they always
bewailed the dismal incongrui-
ty. Henceforth, we rejoice to
say, the Collegian is freed from
matters of this kind, and will
not be compelled to try to serve
two ends at once...”

“Gentlemen of the Ring-tum
Phi, you have our best wishes.
Gentlemen of the Ring-tum Phi,
we give you our sincerest
thanks. Students of W. and L.,
we congratulate you on the ad-
vent of the long needed week-
ly!”

The year was 1897. The
Southern Collegian was still a
high-quality magazine, being
published by the Graham
Literary Society. The Ring-tum
Phi was designed to be a
somewhat lighter, perhaps even
ribald, complement to the Col-
legian.

The year the football coach had
to send away for a special
noseguard “‘to protect the col-
ossal proboscis which accom-
panies Mr. Fitzhugh’s coun-
tenance.” (‘‘Mr.”’ Fitzhugh was

Radio Show and it’s guaranteed to warm the cockles of your heart.
The show contains a sordid combination of off-the-wall humor, in-
terpolated with performances by rock and roll favorites. You'll
hear such classic artists as the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Led
Zeppelin and the Partridge Family. Yes, you'll hear these and
many more of rock’s most influential artists. Additionally, Buffalo
Bo and his cast of idiots will explore new vistas in the world of com-
edy. So, if you’re not hung over out of your mind, tune in each Satur-
day morning from 9:30-12:00 for the Buffalo Bo Radio Show. It’s an
experience you’ll not soon forget.

 

 
New Members Keep Up Yes’
High Standards In Drama

by Michael Sokolowski

Just as 1978’s Tormato makes
its first appearance in the cut-
out bins, the two new members
of Yes make their first ap-
pearance on the latest addition
to the Yes repertoire: Drama. If
the album was hurridly con-
ceived and recorded (Trevor
Horn and Geoff Downs joined
the band in May), it is hardly
noticeable. The new songs are
for the most part quite well
written and expertly perform-
ed.

Steve Howe and Chris Squire
as usual are at their virtuosic
best, while Alan White (the
weak link in the band since the
departure of Bill Bruford) pro-
vides us with his typically
heavy rythmic backing that is
at best functional and unob-
trusive and at worst ponderous
and obnoxious...White, a fine
rock and roll drummer to be
sure, simply does not have the
chops to adequately drive a
band whose music is as com-
plex as that of Yes. As a result,
the technical fireworks of Howe
and Squire are contrasted by an
often simplistic and
unimaginative drum line.

The good news, however, is
that ex-members Jon Anderson
and Rick Wakeman have been
satisfactorily replaced by
Trevor Horn and Geoff Downs,
who surprisingly enough, are
former members of the Buggles
(remember their unforgettable

classic, Video killed the Radio
Star?). Horn, admittedly, does
not have the range of vocal ex-
pertise to match Anderson, yet
he knows how to use what he’s
got, and with him Yes can main-
tain that signature ‘Yes
sound.”’ Horn also plays
acoustic and electric guitars in
concert and proves to be quite a
proficient fretless bass player
on Run through the Light. Geoff
Downs establishes himself as a
fine keyboardist whose solo
lines and synthesizer tonalities
are far more interesting than
those of Wakeman. Though

Downs’ technical abilities
perhaps fall short of Wake-
man’s, his conceptual

capabilities are light years
ahead of his’ tasteless
predecessor.

The biggest surprise of the
album is the fact that its two
best songs, Machine Messiah and
Into the Lens were both compos-
ed by Horn and Downs. Machine
Messiah, the record’s opening
selection, is undoubtedly the
finest composition to be found
on Drama: It is a thematically
well-developed song, replete
with rhythmic and dynamic
contrasts, featuring crisp, tight
ensemble playing as well as the
superb vocal harmonies for
which Yes is renowred. The rest
of the songs, with one exception.
are similarly well-conceived

On The Road To Sweet Briar

Many Washington and Lee
students will remember a
former Sweet Briar Ad-
ministrator’s words when he ex-
plained that married students
were not permitted to enroll
there because ‘‘only virgins
sleep in Sweet Briar beds.”’ But
a prominent insider’s guide to
colleges says he is wrong, and
we tend to agree.

Last year the Ring-tum Phi
described Sweet Briar College
in Amherst as ‘‘the most closely
guarded bastion of the Southern
gentry in the area, probably in
the entire South.’’ Overall,
Sweet Briar still runs the
tightest security with Randolph
Macon finishing a close second.
And yes, there are still some
fraternities banned from the
campus because of parties
thrown a few years back.

“Sweetbush”’ or simply ‘‘the
Bush,”’ as some Minks prefer to
call this lovely school, is blessed
with the prettiest campus in this

campus in the entire world, bar-
ring the Tibetan schools for
Monks in the Himalaya Moun-

tains. On the far side of campus
is the famous Boathouse, home

of the annual ‘‘Bums”’ dance, or
“bogus ball’’ as some call it.
The Boxwood house is on the
other side of campus from the
Boathouse and is a nice place to
stop for an unusual to bizarre
evening. For those of you enjoy
middle of the road action and
sublime entertainment, there
are the various dormitories.
But be selective, some of those
girls are closer than you think!
However, should you be talk-
ed into spending the night, The
Bush can be bad. You see,
before entering the Bush, you
must stop at a photomat stand
where a slow-witted security of-
ficer takes down your name,
license plate number and
whatever information he thinks
is relevant on a given evening.
At the witching hour he will
come looking for ‘‘male

Visitors.’”’ These guys mean
business and have been known
to search a few closets. You
might try hiding under the bed
or running down the fire escape
if things get too bad.

Like all parties at the sur-
rounding girl’s schools, Sweet
Briar’s parties offer a
miniscule amounts of warm
beer, smoky rooms, a variety of
bands and clothes which look
like patio furniture designs. As
you all know, the ‘“‘women’’ at
the Bush love to ride horses, a
campus activity they can well
afford with so much spare time
and an isolated campus.
Sometimes the bright clothes
and equestrian image form a
mellow blend which can provide
for a good time. Of course, there
are other times when the two
factors combine to make the
place rotten. On the whole, the
Bush is a good road trip, maybe
the best, though we cannot tell
you why.

Commentary:

 

Forget the Talk,
Ali Still Great

by Ralph Frasca

From the Washington Post to
the Kalamazoo Kaliedoscope,
so-called experts have been fill-
ing the sports page in the past
fewdays, expounding on how
Mr. Muhammed Ali will be
pulverized, pounded and
generally embarrassed by a
flurry of flying fists from one
Mr. Lawrence Holmes in
tonight’s pugilistic exercise.

To those of you who have been
involved in lifelong spelunking
expeditions, and who have
emerged just long enough to
partake of some overpriced
delicacies at the snack bar and
stumble across a copy of our
beloved Ring-tum-Phi, which
some industrious Woods Creek
student used for a birdcage
liner, let me explain the two
aforementioned gentlemen.

Mr. Ali, a would-be poet and
philosopher, has seen fit to take
flamboyancy to childish ex-
tremes. You see, ladies and
gentlemen, Mr. Ali is constantly
in need of some cash, which is
why he is emerging from retire-
ment for the umpteenth time.
He has not fought since
September of 1978, and during
the course of two years, the
millions of dollars he recieved
for beating the Toothless
Wonder, Leon Spinks, has
somehow been spent. Now, one
may wonder how some $6
million can be spent over the
course of two years. Overtipp-
ing the kid who delivered the
pizza? Who knows. Anyway, $8
million should be enough to hold
him over for a little while, until
he comes out of retirement
again.

Mr. Holmes is playing the
strong, silent type, the good guy
who has quietly vowed to
silence forever the boisterous
braggadocio of his Trampas-
like opponent. All of Ali’s recent
competition has opted for the
same image. After all, modesty
is one of this nation’s great

values, right? This attitude just
doesn’t seem to flourish in the
bizarre world of boxing,
though, and the consensus is
that the gregarious Ali is the
people’s choice every time.

Truth is, Holmes is probably
the best fighter Ali has faced in
the last few years, and this
match will be a challenge to see
if Ali can still stick it to the
other guy, like he did with such
good boxers as_ Frazier,
Foreman, and Liston, and such
human punching bags as Scott
LeDoux.

In my lead I mentioned the
“experts,’’ journalistic sages
who shove the box sceres of
also-ran baseball teams into the
nether reaches of the sports
section so that they may
nauseate us with unceasing
repetitions of Ali’s virtual
senior citizenship. The writers
have all but confined Ali to a
wheelchair in their prosaic
fashion. As a beacon of truth, let
me state that Ali is actually a
very healthy 38 years old. Yes,
he is in fine form, and yes, I
believe he will defeat Larry
Holmes.

Now, I didn’t say that Ali
would trounce or crush Holmes.
I don’t believe that Ali can do
that to so expert a fighter.
Therefore, the fight will pro-
bably be a fifteen-round en-
durance test.

Why would anyone want to
pick an allegedly bedraggled
old man like Ali over a seasoned
young lion like Holmes? Well,
when this writer was knee-high
to just about everything,
Muhammed Ali was champ.
When I entered elementary
school, Muhammed Ali was
champ. When I recieved my
first kiss, Muhammed Ali was
champ. In a pensive moment
during the course of writing this
article, it occurred to me that
Muhammed Ali will probably
always be the heavyweight

Booters Lose To WVW, 6-1;
To Host Davidson On Sunday

by Mark Schramm

With nine of its starting
eleven players having been
recruited from foreign coun-
tries, West Virginia Wesleyan
proved to be too strong for
W&L, walking off with a 6-1 vic-
tory over the Generals last
Saturday.

Two goals within the first ten
minutes, the first on a ball that
was miscleared by the defense
and rebounded into the net, the
second on a near-post corner
kick that eluded goalie Kevin
Carney, deflated a fired-up
W&L squad.

“Our youth showed in the de-
fense,’’ said Coach Rolf Pira-
nian. ‘‘We’re starting four new
fullbacks and they had to try to
keep up with guys that play on
an international level in their
home countries. Their ball
skills and speed were too
much.”

The loss of Defensive Back
Tad Renner to a leg injury
hastened the decline of the
defense. ‘“Tad is our key player
on defense,” Piranian said.
“The other guys look to him for
leadership. After he went out,
we became a bit disorganized.”’

Actually, were it not for some
breakdowns in the midfield and
some bad luck, four of WVW’s
goals could have been pre-

vented. Their fourth goal of the
first half was typical — a ball
lobbed toward the W&L goal
floated just over the outstretch-
ed fingertips of goalie Carney.
“Those garbage goals did us
in,’’ was-an opinion shared by
several of the players after the
game.

Despite the 4-0 deficit at the
half, the Generals continued to
play aggressive soccer and
began taking the play to WVW.
The Generals’ front line of Tom
Elder, Captain Mark Turner,
and Brad Poorman consistantly
applied pressure to the WVW
keeper.

Poorman had another out-
standing game as he unleashed
several shots from his right
wing slot and clearly dominated
his defender.

The Generals’ lone goal came
on a brilliant individual effort
from freshman center Roland
Simon, who stole the ball at
midfield and dribbled right
through the middle of the WVW
defense. Stopping at the 18 yard
mark, he fired a shot that found
the upper right corner of the
net, leaving the startled goal-
tender flatfooted.

Simon was voted Player of
the Game by his teammates.

The Generals continued to
work hard, but the cifects of a

five hour bus ride and the loss of
Sweeper Peter Collins caught
‘sp with them in the final 20
minutes.

Piranian didn’t seem too per-
turbed over the loss. “We’ve got
to look at this positively;” he
said. ‘‘Our offense played well.
The defense had some prob-
lems, but it’s nothing we can’t
fix with some practice.”

The Generals’ third con-
secutive road game is this
Wednesday at Hampden-
Sydney, in a renewal of one of
ODAC’s most heated rivalries.
“It will be a tough, exciting
game, and we’ll be gunning for
goals from the opening whis-
tle,’’ Piranian said. Their offen-
sive punch will be given a lift by
the addition of speedy Center
Ted Wilkerson, who is being
brought up from J.V.

The Generals’ first home
game is Oct. 4 against Division
One ranked Davidson.

In Brown Invitational

by Dave Johnson

The W&L water polo team
traveled to Brown University
last weekend for the Brown In-
vitational tournament, where
they dropped all three of their
games, losing to Brown 13-5, to
Harvard 10-7, and to MIT 10-7.

The losses came after the
previous week’s impressive 18-9
victory over Johns Hopkins.
The Generals travel this Friday
to the Slippery Rock Invita-
tional, to compete against
Bucknell, Indiana of Pa.,
Princeton, Millersville, and the
host team.

tinues to be in its defensive
play, where breakdowns at

Netmen Win Twice

by Phil Murray
The W&L Generals’ tennis
team ran into some tough Divi-
sion I competition this weekend
in Annapolis, coming away with
only two first-round victories.

Number one Peter Lovell cap-
tured a first round triumph in
the A Flight by defeating
Swarthmore’s Rod Dovdle in
straight sets, 6-3, 7-5. Lovell
could get no further, however,
losing to Navy standout Craig
Morrison, 1-6, 4-6, in the quarter
finals.

Doug Gaker was also in the A
Flight. Gaker, though, was un-
able to seriously challenge in
either of his matches, losing 1-6,
4-6, to Inaki Calvo of Maryland
in the first round and 10-3 in a
ten-game pro set consolation
match.

The number three and four
men, Steve Denny and Wes
Younge, suffered runaway de-
feats as well. Denny lost to his
Penn. St. rival 2-6, 0-6, while
Younge went down, 0-6, 1-6.

The only other victory of the
day came in the D Flight where
freshman Evans Crowe scored
a convincing 6-1, 6-3 victory in
the first round. Although he lost
a tough 10-6 second round con-
test, Coach Franke saw Crowe’s
performance as one of the
brightest moments of the
weekend.

The doubles team could not
muster a victory in their four
first-round attempts. The first
team of Lovell and Gaker had
the best chance, but lost a hard
fought match to the Maryland
team of Calvo and Kitty, 4-6, 6-3,
4-6. The other three, Denny and
Younge, Mark Williams and
Tim Baird, and Mike Reed and
Sumner Bouldnin, each lost in
straight sets.

This weekend the Generals
travel to Harrisonburg for a
four school round-robin tourna-
ment. The Generals face James
Madison Friday and Richmond
and VMI Saturday.

better testing ground for the

 

critical moments were respon-
sible for the losses. These
breakdowns were not individual
mistakes, but, instead, were
what Coach Remillard called
“mental mistakes that all
young teams make.”’

Remillard himself also took
responsibility for some of the
mental errors of the tourna-
ment,

The major bright spot for the
team was its obviously superior
swimming skills, which are the
result of intense preseason
training. The play of freshman
Rand McClain, who scored six
goals in the tourney and leads
the team with a season total of
nine, has also been impressive.

Despite the losses and the
poor defensive play, Remillard
expressed optimism for his
young team. “Our successes
may be a while in corning, but
when they do come, they will be
authentic and consistent.”

The water polo Generals’ first
home matches will be in the
Southern League Tournament
on Oct, 24-26. Perhaps then the

Reading Bestsellers

While most of us are busy
reading Business Law, Chaucer
and various other masterful
works calculated to improve
our fledgling minds, college
students around the nation are
mastering the complexities of
other literary works.

According to a list compiled
by The Chronicle of Higher
Education, some of the top
books college students are
reading include ‘‘Sophie’s
Choice”’ by William Styron and

‘The Empire Strikes Back” by
Donald F. Glut.

Styron’s book is about “‘star-
crossed lovers and the nature of
evil’’ and the latest Star Wars
Book speaks for itself.

But the most interesting book
on the list is “Petals on the
Wind’’, a masterpiece in which
“the children take revenge”’ in
a horror sequel.

And professors wonder why
college students are illiterate.

In the last issue, we presented
interviews with three of the six
new members of _ the
undergraduate faculty at
Washington and Lee: Pro-
fessors E. A. Vincent, Herman
A. Lauter, and Lawrence E.
Babits. In this issue, Iain S.
McLean, visiting professor of
politics; David Bausum, assis-
tant professor of mathematics;
and Richard F. Grefe, instruc-
tor and assistant reference and
public-services librarian are
featured.

McLean, who was born in
Scotland, is university lecturer
in politics at Oxford, where he
has been for two years. He is
here in the U.S. for the first
time through an exchange ar-
rangement between Oxford and
W&L, and is teaching a course
in British politics on Tuesday
afternoons.

While in the U.S. McLean
plans to study the 1980 presiden-
tial election for a book he is
writing on American politics
and government... McLean
recently returned from Denver,
Colorado, where he has been

following the campaign of
Senator Hart, and pursuing one
of his interests, railroads.

“Colorado has the largest col-
lection of preserved steam
railroads in the world,” said
McLean. He traveled on the
Cumbers and Toltec line,
“which must be one of the two
or three most spectacular
steam lines in the world.”

McLean noted one major dif-
ference between teaching at Ox-
ford and here is the size of
classes. “We (at Oxford) teach
in very small groups, especially
in our subject (politics), often
with just one student,”’ he said.
Students are required to write
an essay per week, and since
the teaching is on a one-to-one
basis, ‘che can’t escape.”

Among McLean’s other in-
terest are music, mountaineer-
ing, rugby and squash.

Richard Grefe is originally
from Jacksonville, Florida. He
came here from South Carolina,
where he was librarian for the

Education Consortium, a

work. He is now assistant
reference and public-services
librarian.

Grefe applied for a position
here last year, but was turned
down. However, his name was
kept on file, and when the cur-
rent position became open, he
was contacted, and, after
another interview, was hired.

Grefe specializes in the
reference aspect of his job, in-
cluding the reserve collections,
inter-library loans and com-
merce library.

Grefe said that around
February the library will
hopefully acquire on-line
bibliographic data bases: com-
puter terminals which will
enable students to make
“completely thorough searches
of particular topics within a
couple of minutes.”’

“It'll be an incredible advan-
tage if you’re doing any sort of
in-depth research project,”’ he
added.

More New Faculty Members Interviewed

Grefe “almost hesitates” to
list reading among his in-
terests, being a librarian, but is
also interested in films, hiking,
and sports like baseball, tennis
and softball.

Bausum graduated from high
school in Lexington, but has
also lived in Tennessee,
Chicago, Louisiana, Boston and
was born in Washington, D.C.

Bausum was teaching math
at the University of Minnesota
when he made a decision to ‘‘get
out of teaching math” and go in-
to photography.

He resigned his post, moved
back to Virginia and built a
house in east Lexington, using
his savings. However, he ran
out of money, and took his cur-
rent position at W&L after being

contacted when a member of
the math department went on
leave for the year.

Bausum spends about half his
time in photography now, and
intends to go into the field full-
time. ‘Photography has

.become a profession for me,

and in a way, mathematics is a
diversion from that this year,”
Bausum said.

Bausum is teaching three sec-
tions of math, including one
designed to help students who
had trouble with trigonometry
in high school.

Bausum’s parents live in this
area, and his father teaches at
V.M.I. He likes the mountains
and enjoys music, bicycle
riding and ‘‘building houses.”’

REVLEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The E.C.’s Dilemma

Clearly the Publications Board and The Executive
Committee are entangled in a dilemma. The EC op-
poses salaries and questions the Pub Board’s power to
give editors and business managers money for their
. services. The Pub Board questions the EC’s power
over the board and realizes the board must be
autonomous if it is to effectively act as publisher for
the university’s publications. The solution to this pro-
blem is simple; the EC must explicitly reaffirm its
support for an autonomous Publications Board. In
return, the board should surrender salaries and let
those who want to do the job for reasons other than
money run the school’s publications.

Briscoe’s Plea...

IFC President Monte Briscoe’s plea for fraternities
to scrutinize the content and ramifications of the Ad
Hoc Committee report on fraternities should not go
unheard. Few people at Washington and Lee are ina
better position to gauge what this report means and
where it will lead fraternities. Briscoe seems to have
a clear idea of what the Report entails, and he is con-
cerned.

Although everyone seems to disagree as to what the
effects of this report will be on the future of frater-
nities at W&L, the report calls its own recommenda-
tions “radical.” Briscoe says the report questions
‘the survival of the fraternity system at W&L.’”’ Dean
of Students Lewis John, the Committee’s chairman,
has called for ‘‘widespread discussion before any long
range action is taken.”

Clearly the ball is now in the fraternities’ court.
Needless to say, we support Briscoe’s efforts to
organize a campus-wide forum on the question. The
time has come for fraternities to rally behind their
elected leader, Briscoe, and examine closely the
fraternity issue. It is possible that the future of frater-
nities is at stake. Fraternity members, do you want a
radical change blamed on your apathy? If not, get a
copy of the report, read and discuss it. Look and see
what may be happening to your future.

On The Privileges Of Citizenship

by Jed Dunn

On the front page of any newspaper these days
can be found an article on the military conflict in
the Middle East. News of such world shaking wars
brings to mind the summer registration of this na-
tion’s nineteen and twenty year olds. That
classification includes about one half of the
students at Washington and Lee. The disturbing
fact is. that while these young men can be drafted,
they are simultaneously denied all the privileges
of citizenship.

While serving one’s country in the military may
be a noble and worthwhile endeavor, one is still
bearing the responsibility of citizenship with one’s
life in the balance. It seems fair that if a young
man can be legally drafted to protect our country,
he should also enjoy all the benefits of being a

responsible, voting citizen. But such is not the
case. It is a fact that in Virginia and several other
states a citizen must have reached the age of
twenty-one in order to purchase liquor (and wine
in Virginia). It is difficult to accept that legislators
(elected by us — citizens eighteen and older) can
fairly deny the privileges of citizenship. With a
potential draft just beyond the election, the time
has come for a consistent definition of ‘‘citizen.’’
The rational standard would see a voting-aged
person, who is eligible for the draft, as a regular
class citizen fully entitled to enjoy all the rights of
citizenship. Perhaps the best way to accomplish
this would be to implement a federal law requiring
that equality of rights under the law shall not be
denied or abridged on account of age, provided
that one is of voting age.

Student Warns Of Coup

The Washington & Lee
University administration has
been warned that if they con-
tinue on their relentless course
to destroy the fraternity system
here, a student led coup d’etat
will take place. The organizers
of this coup say they will allow

the administration only a few

more weeks to change its pre-
sent policies or drastic
measures will ensue. If ‘The
New Plan’’ is put into effect, the
organizers hope they can
assume control in a bloodless
coup, similar to the one which
was recently staged by the
Turkish military. However, in
the case of resistance by the
present administration, an ex-
ROTC commando unit, led by
the notorious ‘“‘Dr. Death,”’ will
be standing at ready. Precau-
tionary measures will soon go
into effect and special bazookas
have been sent from Paraguay
to prevent administration
members from attempting
escape via fast automobiles.
The F.I.A. (Fraternal In-
telligence Agency) reports that

the administration is fully
aware of the chances of a coup,
and already extortion, transfer,
and embezzlement of university
funds has begun. The coup
organizers do not seem to be
bothered by this. So said one,
‘‘As long as we control the
university itself, we shall have
no worries. Outside assistance
has been promised by both Qad-
dafi and the Che Guevera
Scholarship Fund. With this
money and fraternal order
mounted by Dr. Death’s com-
mando unit, Washington and
Lee shall always remain a prep-
pie hideaway from the outside
world.”

The organizers of this coup
did all of their planning in
secret, up until this fall when it
became known that the ad-
ministration was planning
another attack on the fraternity
system. Reports show that for
the past few years the ad-
ministration has wanted to take
control of the actual fraternity
houses, but has waited until this
time, now that they believe the

student body too apathetic to
stage any resistance. But now
that the coup d’etat is out of the
closet, so to speak, the student
body has shown wide support.
The F.1.A.-reports that once the
present administration leaders
have been deposed, the student
body favors Jefferson Davis
Futch as the new University
President.

The new administration plans
to run the University in a more
efficient manner, by allowing
the fraternities to operate along
their own guidelines; no longer
forcing students to pay $20.00 to
register their cars, and a com-
mittee that will be forthcoming,
subject to the approval of the
student body by referendum. If
this new constitution passes,
faculty salaries will increase by
54%, with many retirement op-

tions available, and each stu-
dent will be required to take

care of a domestic animal and
tend to a garden piot.

Oh, alas...alas. Woe is me. Numb is my nose. To what ill-fated
fortune, what fraternal fiendishness, what cold comic do I owe my
present sorrow, my ignoble imprisonment. When I last described
the preparations aboard the Golden Ale, I was a young indepen-
dent, a southern freeman with regal heritage and classic costume.
Doctor Snoblow by name and a druggist by trade, I had no disease,
no cankers, no acne. But I was kidnapped by these Foul Greeks and
am now two weeks aboard this slave ship, this floundering garbage
galleon. Forced to consume vast quantities of ale, ale and chips, ale
and hog, ale and chocolate, and later raped by the whoring sirens of
Maconia, I am now a blaze of red-sores and awash with silvery pus.
I fear I am not long for this world. ft is with a failing hand that I
relate to you the sorry events of this slave rush. Woe is the life of the
coca leaf-peeler.

On the third day out, I found myself in the company of the
bootblacks. They seemed happy enough scrubbing the decks for the
night’s pig roast and singing their gospel chanties. Their earthy
black skins were fading; soon they would be sophomores-second-
class. New slaves would toil in their stead. I felt sorry for the
pledges and allowed them to polish my boots, and offered my magic
snuff. Then that dreadful cry from the crow’s nest.

—Jolly Roger sighted on the horizon. All hands on deck! Man
your stations.

The accursed Captain High barked commands,

—You there, you scad, unchain me from this wench. Hand me my
bottle, and send this whore away. Away I say. Where be these
pirates and how many guns aboard? Where is Jack Black? Fire the
bongs and burn the hemp. We'll stone ‘em. Hi ho, Jack, what do you
make of it?

—They are Trojans, Captain sir, from the Institute...Ruthless
and bloodthirsty. Vile and militant. But ’tis worse, sir. They are im-
mune to our intoxicants and impervious to our diseased ladies.
Their only weakness is in the brain. Cunning words and fast double-
talk will defeat them. They cringe at knowledge and feed on ig-
norance.

—Good thinking, and just in time. The shaveheads are alongside.
Where is that fountain of wit, that tower of wisdom? Command him
to spew forth the seeds of knowledge and destroy these rub-

The next four days were hell. All I could hear was Moby Dick on
the amplifier. His terrible words still echo in my enfeebled mind.

But we survived, if you call this survival. We are docked in the
Dark Continent now. A slave rush team has already lured a tribe of
ebon babes. These poor innocents are already addicted to our
wares, to our parties. They have sold their souls to the devil for a
few highs. Tonight when the moon is low, the gaffs will be out.
Tomorrow they will be hooked. Sorry Freshmen. ..I can offer no ad-

1897: Year Of The Great Hell Scandal

(Reprinted from the Ring-tum

Scandalous Verse ~~

Eighteen and ninety-seven.
The year of the Great Hell Scan-
dal. It seems the very first
editor-in-chief, George
Houston, in the fourth issue of
the neophyte newspaper, pub-
lished a column of ‘Football
Songs,”’ one of which concluded
with this verse:

“Each other’s back, boys,

“‘Has got a knack, boys,

“For making gains, sir,

‘Round the end.

“And it’s a sin, sir,

“For Oberlin (a
player), sir,

‘To buck the V.M.I. boys’ line
so awful hard.

‘Then join the yell, boys,

‘‘And yell like hell, boys,

“Sure enough.

“To W&L U., boys,

‘‘And foot-ball, too, boys,

“‘Let’s give a rousing, rumbl-
ing, roaring yell.

“‘Ring-tum Phi, stickeribum,

of naughtiness which makes the
first rhyme in the last verse.
