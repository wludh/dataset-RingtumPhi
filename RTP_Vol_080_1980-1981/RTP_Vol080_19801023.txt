E.C. Dismisses WLUR Survey

by Cope Moyers

A motion that would have
allowed the Executive Commit-
tee to conduct a controversial
survey about music programm-
ing at W&L’s student radio sta-
tion WLUR, failed at Monday
night’s EC meeting.

EC member Jim Vines said
he wanted the EC to conduct the
survey about the radio station’s .
programming after hearing
several complaints by students
about the quality of programm-
ing at the station. But after a
lengthy discussion on the com-
mittee’s jurisdiction in the mat-
ter, the motion failed 7-3. Vines,
Tripp Brower and Willie
Mackie voted in favor of the mo-
tion.

Vines said the motion was not
an attempt to regulate WLUR’s

programming but was instead
aimed at getting more student
input into some of the musical
programming.

“I don’t believe enough time
is being spent by the station in
recruiting students to work at
the station,”’ Vines said.

Vines said the survey would
have been conducted during
winter registration in the
registrar’s office and possibly
during this week’s freshmen
elections. The questionnaire
was to be in three parts, asking
students if they were happy
with afternoon programming
and classical music program-
ming. The third question would
have asked students who were
interested in working for WLUR
for their names and phone
numbers, which would then
have been turned over to the
station.

members and a few EC

Sea Level Replaces
NRPS;Weekend Set

by Frank Billingsley

Sea Level, a jazz-rock band
from Macon, Georgia, will
replace the New Riders of the
Purple Sage as Homecoming’s
main attraction at the Friday
night concert in Doremus Gym-
nasium.

Last Thursday night the New
Riders of the Purple Sage, a
five-man group out of San Fran-
cisco, called the SAB to cancel
their engagement for Friday’s
homecoming concert. The band
was in studio recording an
album and fell behind schedule.
They felt that their album took
priority over the engagement.

What is the normal reaction
of a Student Activities Board co-
chairman when the homecom-
ing band cancels out a week
before the engagement? ‘‘Your
heart tremors,’’ Says co-
chairman Pryse Elam, and he
should know. ‘‘We had original-
ly wanted Sea Level, but they
were too expensive. They’ve
come down in price and we are
very happy about getting
them,” Elam said. Sea Level
dropped the price from $7,500 to
$5,600.

The New Riders of the Purple
Sage were not legally bound to
play at W&L because no written
contract had been finalized.
‘“‘We had the New Riders book-
ed, not contracted. All they
broke was a verbal agree-

ment,” Elam said.

The SAB had mailed the final,
signed contract Thursday mor-
ning, but by then it was too late
because NRPS already cancell-
ed. There were 68 sections and
riders that had to be approved
by co-chairman Jamie Small,
Advisor Mike Capetto, and
Elam. Details of a dressing
room for the band and adequate
power could not be finalized un-
til Wednesday night.

Elam said that last minute
cancellations are not terribly
uncommon in the music field.
“It happens, you just hope it
doesn’t happen to you,”’ he said.

Elam said he was ‘‘shocked’’
when he learned that the New
Riders had cancelled out. “I
was particularly worried that
homecoming would be a failure
and that we wouldn’t have a
band. But Sea Level is excellent
and we anticipate one of the
best homecomings ever,” he
said.

Will Elam buy the New
Riders new album when it is
finally released? ‘‘If it’s any
good,’’ he said casually.

The concert begins at 8:00
tomorrow night in Doremus
Gymnasium. Skip Castro will
play as warm-up band followed
by Sea Level. No beverages of
any kind will be served and
smoking will be confined to the
lobby area. Admission is free.

G-L Renovation Will Cause Problems

by Edward Gonsalves

Student’s regard the Univer-
sity’s proposed renovation plan
as an inconvenience, yet at the
same time see a necessity for
the renovation.

“The renovation will increase
conflicts next year,” says Jake
Purcell, head dormitory
counselor, ‘‘But there is no

alternative, Graham-Lees
should be renovated.

Next year, Davis, Gilliam and
Baker Dormitories will be oc-
cupied by displaced freshmen.
The three dormitories accor-
ding to William Hartog, Dean of
Admissions for the University,
will hold 280 students next year,
an increase of 104 students over

as we do in every other area of
Washington and Lee life, for
students to develop a sense of
responsibility for their own af-
fairs. That. is a part of the
educational philosophy of this

University, as I think you know
well.

We know, and have always
known, that students who leave
here will be expected by a dif-
ficult and uncertain world to
cope with the problems and

temptations that will confront
them, the digressions that will
always be at their feet. We
know they will be expected to
develop a sense of responsibili-
ty and will be expected to
discharge it as soon as they
leave these walls. Our effort has
always been and will continue
to be to expose our students to
as large a measure of respon-
sibility as they can take.

this year’s residents. The
Robert E. Lee Hotel will occupy
approximately 70 students.

“Many problems will occur
next year besides problems of
conduct,” claims Ken Lang, a
Gilliam dormitory counselor.
‘Complaints will be made, and
rightfully so, about the limited
closet and bathroom space.”’

But Frank Parsons, assistant
to the president of the Universi-
ty, believes that the renovation
won’t cause too many pro-
blems. ‘Single rooms are a
norm for this school. But at any
other school doubles are stan-
dard accommodations for
freshmen. In Gilliam Dor-
mitory, some freshmen will be
sharing rooms as small as 13 x
9. Due to the doubling of every
room, there will be eighteen
freshmen for every two
showers.

“In Davis and Baker Dor-
mitory the situation is similar,

Huntley Remarks On WE&L

...We need to keep a sharp
focus on the central purpose for
which this school exists — on
the increasingly critical impor-
tance of the liberal arts in the
world into which our students
will be graduated. In this day of
increasing specialization, it
seems to me that this is
especially important for pre-
professional and _ pre-business
students, as most of our
students are.

We have always sought and
will increasingly strive to pro-
vide the kinds of pre-
professional offerings that will
introduce them to the profes-
sions and careers upon which
they may embark when they
leave us. But our effort is not to
use those kinds of programs to
supplant the liberal arts or as
an alternative to the liberal
arts. These kinds of programs,
as we see it, must be taught and
structured into our curriculum
as complements to — indeed as
part of — the liberal arts objec-
tive.

Our intention here is to have a
small academic community
Where curriculum and views
are diverse but where there is a
shared commonality of purpose
about the broad reach of the
future of our ideals; where ex-
cellence and trust in each other
and respect for differences of
opinion can exist harmonious-
ly; where vitriol and jealousy
are ata minimum.

 

HUFFMAN’S

We want the young people
who leave here to emerge with
tough minds, with confidence in
their own ability to meet the
future: the kind of self-
confidence that is born of the
rigorous academic standards
Washington and Lee retains anc
intends to strengthen; born of
the confrontations our students
have here with personal deci-
sions about their lives — and the
values in their lives.

We want them to have the
ability to be trusting without be-
ing naive; to be confident
without being arrogant; to be
tolerant without being con-
descending — to be strong-
minded and humble at the same
time. Those are lofty ideals, and
they are not new ones for this in-
stitution. We do not intend to

abandon them; especially do we
not intend to abandon them in
these days. We shall never
wholly achieve them, of course;
but we shall continue to strive
for them.

(Our students) are the only
reason Washington and Lee is in
existence. What occurs to them
after they leave us is the only
test that matters of whether
Washington and Lee is a suc-
cessful university. Do they
leave here with characteristics
of the kind I’ve just attempted
to describe? Can they cope with
the kinds of complexities life
will present to them? Can they
have the attributes of tough
minds, self-confidence and
humility that we think the world
requires of them?

We think they can.

are plentiful.”

The inconveniences that will
arise are perceived by students
as something they will just have

EC member Willie Mackie
said the committee has a
responsibility to check into all
student affairs, including those
involving the radio station.

“It’s important to get discon-
tent into the open,’’ Mackie
said.

But WLUR General Manager
and professor Robert de Maria
reminded the committee that
the station is licensed by the
Federal Communications Com-
mission for Lexington and not
just the Washington and Lee
community.

“It is hard to program
because we’re trying to serve as
many as we can,’’ de Maria
said.

“Running the station is a jug-
gling act,’’ he added.

de Maria did encourage
students who have complaints
or suggestions to talk to him
directly. He also asked the Ex-
ecutive Committee to report

“If they don’t like what’s go-

Maria said.

In other business, the com-
mittee approved a motion by
Eric Myers that the EC form a
committee to investigate stu-
dent use and abuse of alcohol
for the purpose of ‘‘raising stu-
dent consciousness on alcohol
abuse.”’

Myers said many parents ex-
pressed concern last weekend
about alcoholism among
students, especially after a
story appeared in the Ring-tum
Phi. Myers, Marshall, Clark
and Frank Smith volunteered to
look into the problem.

The committee also heard the
monthly report from Contact,
which said it had scheduled
Senator Adlai Stevenson to
speak next Thursday. Senator
Richard Schweiker will speak
at W&L on November 3 and
economic reporter Irving R.
Levine will speak November 11.

The third annual Superdance

scheduled for February 6-8,
could be the most successful
ever. Last year the 30-hour
marathon raised over $18,000
toward helping those struck by
Muscular Dystrophy.

The goal this year is $20-
thousand dollars.

Co-chairman J. Hemby and
Tripp Brower are confident
that figure can be reached, in
part by the large turnout at the
first steering committee
meeting held Monday, October
20. They do‘say, however, that

The unique attribute of this
charitable event is that it also
provides for entertainment for

Last year the marathon
featured 22 hours of live music

Probably few students con-
sider where their tuition money
goes after they finish paying all
the bills. How this money is us-
ed is important, however,
because it helps determine the
quality of education a student
receives.

As explained by Mr. Stewart
Epley, the University
treasurer, the money that
makes up Washington and Lee’s
revenues, all 13.4 million
dollars of it, is acquired in
several ways, Money from. tui-
tion, gifts, and endowments is
put together to form the total
revenue, which for 1980-81 came
to $13,399,900.

Tuition; Where Does It Go?

This money is spent accor-
ding to a budget that is
prepared the previous spring.
The budget is planned in a
series of steps starting when the
department heads present their
estimated expenditures for the
following year to their respec-
tive deans. The deans take
these estimates, trimming
them where they decide expen-
ditures are not necessary, and
give them to the president and
the treasurer.

These men then make
changes to the estimates that
they deem appropriate and
compare these estimates with
the expected revenues for the
coming year. The deans, presi-
dent and treasurer may still
make changes after these
numbers have been compared.

Up until several years ago, the
numbers for the estimates and
revenues always matched.
However, because of inflation,
the estimates for expenditures
have exceeded the expected
revenues for the past few years.
The difference between
revenues and expenditures is
made up by gifts that the
University does not receive on
an annual basis, such as money
that is donated to the University
as a gift in someone’s will. This
years total expenses came-to
$13,548,800. This created a total
deficit of $148,000 that was
made up by these special gifts.
The
University would not release
the amount that each depart-
ment receives. This policy ex-
ists, explained Mr. Epley, to
avoid any animosity “

On The Road To Hollins

If one is willing to endure an
interminably long drive down
Route 81, Hollins College lurks
in the outermost reaches of the
bustling metropolis of Roanoke,
waiting to smother the un-
suspecting freshmen in _ its
southern hospitality.

The security is not as op-
pressive as some of the other
girls’ schools, but this fact will
scarcely seem imporian. 9
discriminating Minks, as
‘Hollie Honeys,’’ more com-
monly known as “Hollie Col-
lies’’ amongst realistic
freshmen, are rarely worth the
effort to jeopardize one’s well-
being at the hands of security
guards.

However, should a persever-
ing Mink encounter a Collie who
is not of a flighty nature, he
may wish to go to the
Rathskeller, Hollins’ answer to
our beloved Cockpit.

No self-respecting freshman
could ever forget the infamous
“Hollins mixer.’’ This was the
eagerly-awaited reward for en-
during a veritable sea of
speeches during orientation
week. Hundreds of hungry
Minks descended upon the
school in search of attractive
females. Hollins girls are, by
and large, the prettiest of all to
be found in the surrounding
girls’ schools; however,
numerous male _ participants
complained of the despised
adversity, ‘‘the blow-off.’’

Regardless, many enjoyed
themselves, although the crowd
around the beer table was
almost impenetrable. . One
freshman commented,

‘Whenever I had half an hour to
waste, I waited in the beer
line.”

The campus parties are fre-
quent enough, although the beer
customarily runs short and the
dance hall is insufficient for
more than two dozen shaggers.
The campus is pleasant,
although lackluster. Tinker
Mountain looms menacingly on
one side, and there is a com-
manding view of numerous
truck stop greasy spoons on the
other.

There are three distinctive
features at Hollins this year. A
sizable number of Texas belles
have flocked to the school in
search of four years of higher
education. Also, many Collies
have a deep-rooted fetish for
horseback riding, although no
horses can be kept on the cam-
pus due to the fact that the

Savory, Peeper Will

Conduct Seminar Here

The Washington and Lee
University Concert Guild will
open its 1980-81 season Tuesday,
Oct. 28 with a performance by
British pianist John Savory at 8
p.m. in Lee Chapel.

Savory, who was born in Lon-
don and began his musical
education there under Herbert
Fryer, was a lecturer for
several years at Oxford Univer-
sity. In 1954 he decided to
devote his musical talents to the
piano and left to study at the
Vienna Conservatoire.

While there, Savory began
giving concerts throughout
Europe including Salzburg,
Barcelona, Madrid and
Florence. Upon his return to
London he began performing
for the English public and giv-
ing annual concert tours in the
United States, including
lecture-recitals and workshops
at many important American
universities.

His W&L performance will in-
clude works by Haydn, Mc-
Cabe, Cardew and Schubert.

  

Savory and Quinn Peeper, a
junior at W&L and president of
the Concert Guild, will conduct
a pre-concert seminar Monday,
Oct. 27, at 7:30 p.m. in duPont
102 at Washington and Lee. The
public is invited.

Tickets for the concert season
may be purchased at a cost of
$10 from Robert Stewart, pro-
fessor of music and head of the
music department at

Washington and Lee, or at the
door on the night of the perfor-

Netmen Lose Twice
In W&L Invitational

by Phil Murray

The Generals’ 1980 Fall tennis
program ended Saturday ‘in a
rain-shortened match against
UVA after losing their first two
matches in the W&L Invita-
tional.

The netmen opened the tour-
nament Friday, losing to a
tough Maryland squad, 8-1.
Peter Lovell lost a tight match
with no. 1 Frank Apecechea 7-6
(5-4), 6-2, and fourth man Wes
Younge finally went down after
a long three-setter.

The only victory came in the
first flight doubles match,
Lovell and Doug Gaker combin-
ed to defeat the team of Myers
and Smith 74, 4-6, 7-5. Steve
Denny and Younge were also in-
volved in a close competition
but same up on the losing end,
5-7, 6-7.

On Saturday morning, as the
rain threatened the tourna-
ment, the Generals lost again to

Ohio, 7-2. Once again Lovell had
his usual fine match and handi-
ly defeated his opponent 6-4, 6-2.
Steve Denny also played well
but came up short, 6-3, 3-6, 1-6.

On the doubles courts, Lovell
and Gaker again turned in a
winning performance 6-4, 6-4
ending the program with a 4-2
record, with both losses coming
in three set matches.

Also noteworthy is the sur-
prising play of Freshman Scott
Berman who could open the
season in the five slot.

Coach Franke believes that
with practice and this in-
valuable experience against
Division I players, his team ean
come back to perform well in
the spring. Franke is especially
pleased with the play of Lovell
during the fall. Franke believes
Lovell has blossomed into a top-
notch’ singles and doubles
player.

Harriers Split Meets

by John Harrison
The W&L cross country team

went to Bridgewater last Fri- .

day uncertain how to approach
the meet with the Eagles.

With everyone back at full
strength after a strong showing
in the previous meet, in which
W&L defeated Norfolk State
and host Christopher Newport
but lost to Lynchburg, there
was cause to go into the fourth
meet of the season with an op-
timistic outlook.

On the other hand, W&L knew
that it would be facing the
toughest competition on their
schedule, Bridgewater being
one of the strongest teams in the
state.

It was no great surprise,
therefore, that Bridgewater
took first place, as the Eagles
had eight runners in the top
eleven spots. What was not an-
ticipated, however, was the way
in which the Eagles totally
dominated the meet, never
allowing the Generals a chance
to overtake them.

Sophomore Jon Kalafant was
the only W&L runner to finish
within a minute of the top spot.

Kalafant’s third-place clocking :

of 27:29 was 26 seconds off the
pace.

Freshman Angus McBryde
and senior co-captain Charlie
Warner, both of whom finished
more than a minute behind
Kelafant, completed the W&L
scoring with fifth and sixth
place finishes in the five-mile
event.

Coach Dick Miller offered a
rather blunt explanation for his
team’s unusually meager per-
formance, ‘‘We didn’t run very
intelligently. We _ let
Bridgewater get a huge lead in
the first few minutes and it was
impossible for us to make up for
.

From these observations, one
gets the feeling that it was a
combination of Bridgewater’s
sheer ability and W&L’s lower

Booters Win Twice As

Williams, Muskin Star

by Mark Schramm
It looks like there is a new
soccer power rising out of the
Shenandoah Valley, and its col-
ors are blue and white.

The Generals’ soccer team
continued to dominate its op-
position as sweeping both mat-
ches last week, first stomping
Gettysburg, 3-0, and then blank-
ing Pratt Institute 1-0, upping
their record to 6-2.

Bryan Williams’ two goals
were more than enough against
Gettysburg. Both teams were
sluggish at the outset and
neither took a distinct advan-
tage.

Midway through the period,
Williams was tripped in the
penalty area by a Gettysburg
defender. His penalty kick
skimmed just inside the post,
and W&L took a 1-0 halftime
lead.

The Generals picked up the
pace in the second half, and
their crisp passing and alert
play gave them several scoring
opportunities. It was outstan-
ding defensive play. However,
that led to their second goal.

As the Gettysburg forwards
lurked around Goalie Kirk
Mancer, Defender Tad Renner
stole the ball and lofted a clear-
ing pass to Midfielder Ben

Muskin. Muskin dished the ball
off to Craig Burns, and the
senior forward’s 25-yard blast
found the back of the net.

Bryan Williams got his se-
cond goal near the end of the
match. Ben Muskin er

another assist as he dropped a
perfect pass to the hustling co-
captain, who cooly placed a shot
in the upper left-hand corner.

The ‘‘No Goal Patrol’’ lived
up to its name as it frustrated
the Gettysburg offense
throughout- the game.
Defenders Tad Renner and
Mark Sullivan shared Player of
the Game awards.

A special award was given to
Goalie Keven Carney, whose
two first half saves broke the
W&L save record (383). As
usual, Carney down played his
role. “It’s nice to have the
record,” the veteran remarked,
“but it’s more important that
the team won. And don’t forget,
I’ve got a great defense in front
of me.”

Defense or not, it is still hard
to forget Mancer’s heroic play
of the past three years, when he
regularly faced 30 or more shots
a game. “I’d rather win,” is
how he puts it.

The Generals won their fifth
game in six tries as they beat
Pratt Institute, 1-0, on Bryan
Williams’ penalty kick goal.

W&L got off to their

customary slow start, but once
again it was the steady, cool-
headed play of Ben Muskin that

turned the tide for the Generals.
The Junior Midfielder, who best
resembles a bearded Franz
Beckenbauer, pushed his team-
mates upfield kept them calm
during Pratt’s offensive rushes.

the Generals dominated, and
they had several scoring oppor-
tunities. Brad Poorman had two
shots stopped in front and
Roland Simon’s diving header

off a corner kick was punched
out,

Teamwork and determination
overcame the superior skills of
the Pratt squad, as Pratt did not
penetrate beyond the Generals’
18-yard line during the final 15
minutes of the half.

The second half continued as
the first, and it became only a
matter of time before the
Generals would score. Craig
Burns unleashed several strong
shots from his right wing slot,
and Player of the Game Chris
Daniel put a shot on goal while
sprawled on the ground after
being flattened by two
defenders.

Finally, Bryan Williams was
fouled in the penalty box, and he
softly nudged his Penalty Kick

inside the right post for his third
goal of the week.
While the Generals

dominated the rest of the way,
(outshooting Pratt 31-8), they
were unable to score another
goal.

“It was really frustrating,”
said Sweeper Peter Collins. .
‘We were all over their net, but
we just couldn’t push it in.’’ Ben
Muskin summed it up best when
he said, “It’s a killer when
you’re pounding on a door and it
won’t open for you.”’

W&L applied pressure until
the end, and Pratt managed on-
ly three serious offensive
thrusts in the second half.

While the fans acknowledged
the excellent play, the biggest
cheers of the day were saved for
the referee, who smartly. red-
carded a stray dog that
wandered onto the field.

The surging Generals take on
ODAC rival Roanoke on
Wednesday .and then head
across the road to face VMI

Generals Beat H-SCE In Miracle Comeback |

by Dale Park
With only one quarter to play
and 13 points down, the

Washington and Lee varsity
football team erupted for seven-
teen fourth quarter points to
shock the _Hampden-Sydney
Tigers 17-13 last Saturday at
Wilson Field.

The win lifted the Generals’
overall record to 4-2 and raised
their ODAC mark to 2-1.
Hampden-Sydney, while losing
to W&L for the second straight
year, watched their record fall
to 2-4.

“At halftime I felt the team
was first,” said head coach
Gary Fallon. ‘‘We were doing a
bad job of tackling out there. On
offense we couldn’t get on track
— we were hurting ourselves
with penalties. Actually, we
were lucky that it was only 7-0
at the end of the half.”’

The Generals’ offense receiv-
ed outstanding second half per-
formance from some new and
old names.

Sophomore tailback Ken
Robinson carried the ball most
of the time during W&L’s late

third period scoring drive. On
the first play of the fourth
quarter Robinson dove into the
end zone from one yard out. The

Fit To Be

Tied

score cut the Sydney lead to
13-7.

Junior quarterback Rich
Hachenburg, replacing junior
Mike Wenke, teamed with
sophomore slot back Jerry
Thompson on several key pass
plays.

On third and twelve from the
W&L 42-yard line, Hachenburg
hit Thompson with a 34-yard
pass. On the very next play,
veteran slot-back Chris Leiser
dashed the remaining 34 yards

‘on a brilliant touchdown run.

Sophomore kicker Bill Devine
netted the point after, and the
Generals went ahead to stay,
14-13, midway through the
fourth quarter.

Fallon commented on Thomp-
son and Leiser: ‘Jerry got his
first opportunity for some play-
ing time and came up with some
clutch receptions. But his per-
formance doesn’t surprise any
of us. Leiser has made a great
comeback (from a leg injury)
this season, and has done well
under the pressure of replacing
Chris Cavalline (sophomore

tailback injured two weeks
ago).”

On the afternoon, Thompson
picked up 71 yards on only nine

carries, while Leiser added 54
yards on fifteen carries.

Through the air, Hachenburg
completed ten of eighteen for
122 yards. Thompson picked up
54 yards on four pass recep-
tions, while junior tight end
Mike Fogarty gained 40 yards
on two catches.

Kicking was an important
part of the General’s comeback
win. Freshman linebacker
Parker Schenecker did the pun-
ting for W&L (replacing the in-
jured Cavalline) and averaged

40 yards a kick, including one
fifty-yard boot. Schenecker
kept the Tiger offense deep in
its own territory early in the
game, placing one “‘coffin-
corner”’ kick out on the HSC one
yard line.

Reliable place kicker Devine,
while nailing down the goahead
extra point, added a crucial 28-
yard field goal with five
minutes left in the game. By
putting the Generals up by four,
Devine forced the Tigers to go
for a touchdown in their final
series. HSC managed to get as
close as the W&L nine yard line
with less then one minute left to
play before the Generals’
defense drove them back.

Leading the

 

Generals’

defense throughout the after-
noon was junior defensive end
Tommy Noble. Noble both in-
tercepted a pass and recovered
a fumble.

“Noble has really blossomed
as a defensive end this season,”
stated Fallon.

Next week the Generals take
on the University of the South in

W&L’s Homecoming game.

Fallon commented about
Sewanee: ‘‘When we played
them last year they were 6-0.
This year they are not as
strong, yet.it should be a wide-
open game. They have two
quarterbacks who like to throw,
so our defensive secondary had
better be ready.”

IFC Rush
Results

by Mike Perry

The Interfraternity Council
announced that 200 freshmen
have pledged Washington and
Lee’s seventeen fraternities.
These 200 men represent 61 per-
cent of the 1980-81 freshman
class.

Dean of Fraternities Affairs
Dan Murphy says this year’s
percentage is consistent with

“results since the mid 70’s of 60.

to 65 percent,” as well as last
year when 63 percent of the
freshmen class elected to
pledge a fraternity.

Murphy noted that the
relatively smaller size of this
year’s freshman class has
resulted in some fraternity
houses recruiting a small
freshman class, thus rendering
‘‘greater importance”’ to the list
of thirty individuals par-
ticipating in deferred fraternity
rush. “It will be important for a
few houses to put on an active
deferred rush program this
year,” Murphy said.

John Wells

Jimmy , Ronnie
and the Networks

As this, the longest presidential ordeal ever, fades into history
(and, perhaps, obscurity), it is interesting to assess media, par-
ticularly television, coverage of the spectacle — all most folks
know about the campaign is what they see through the network
camera lens.

We see Jimmy Carter, trying to convince us that an abysmal, in-
effective administration is better than one which is anxious to
launch our atomic salvos and end LifeOnThisPlanetAsWeKnowlt.

We see Ronald Reagan trying to tell us that, well, we just can’t af-
ford four more years of Jimmy Carter.

And John Anderson says we can doa lot better than that.

Since polls indicate that various percentages of U.S. voters are
trying to decide which of two or possibly three candidates is the
lesser of as many evils, it makes sense that the candidates are do-
ing their best to draw such distinctions among themselves, in their
rhetoric and campaign commercials.

Many network reporters seem to almost openly despise the presi-
dent, perhaps having experienced his deceptive, self-righteous
nature at close range. Starting with his Atlanta remarks about
Reagan’s hatred and racism, coverage of the Carter campaign
focused mainly on Jimmy’s long-standing habit of smearing his op-
ponents with outrageous, inflammatory falsehoods, which he would
piously deny later. Words like ‘‘mean’’ and ‘‘petty’’ were used to
describe his methods. Where were these terms when, during the
primaries, he refused to honor his promise to debate Ted Kennedy
and then called the senator ‘‘unpatriotic’’?

Now, since Carter’s extravagant rhetoric has become routine,
the so-called ‘‘war-peace’”’ topic — raised entirely by Carter to
divert attention from the defense posture he’s rendered impotent
—is treated as a genuine issue by the networks. Reagan has had to
answer to it in a paid political broadcast on CBS.

The Carter folks are upset, too, because they think the networks
have been giving Reagan a “free ride.’’ The number of times our
attention has been drawn to the GOP nominee gagging on his foot
attests to the validity of this indignation.

The White House has been careful of its image and is aware of
some areas of softness. For instance, the Big Gun in the family
quarters — the unofficial Democratic candidate, Rosalynn — has >
been kept in the wings all fall, except to giggle and grin at official
functions. The first lady, with her $600,000 staff budget and perceiv-
ed policy-making influence, has been one of many Carter con-
troversies, and she may be considered a liability.

Reagan aides, who probably have been paranoid about the press
for years, remain cautious.-Both candidates have been begged by
their advisers in recent appearances to stick entirely to the text of
their campaign speeches — otherwise the big story on the evening
news would be extemporaneous remarks such as Carter calling
Reagan a Marxist child-molester or Reagan saying fish cause
water pollution.

Someone wrote after the conventions that this campaign is more
fairly covered than any other because both candidates are hated
equally by the press. This says as much about the media as it does
about the candidates themselves.

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

EC vs. FCC

The Executive Committee escaped certain embar-
rassment Monday evening by defeating a motion call-
ing for a survey to determine student opinion regar-
ding WLUR programming. While the EC’s attempt to
serve the student body’s preference may seem
valiant and even correct, our student government is
clearly out of bounds and overmatched.

the radio station is complying with federal
regulations—the EC would have to deal with the
federal government in this matter. Good luck fellas.

Housing Follies

The housing plans for next year stir up images of a
tenement building or a slave ship—generally over-
crowded. One can picture four freshmen stacked in a
closet, forced to shower at the gymnasium. Freshmen
in the Robert E. Lee Hotel will have a bar just down
the steps, which could be a bigger problem than over-
crowding. We serioulsly doubt, as Mr. Parson sug-
gests, that many freshmen are going to walk across
the street every time they want to take a shower.
What will we have then, a freshman class of dirtballs
who look like Pigpen in Charles Schultz’s comic strip
‘Peanuts’?

We are glad to see the University is going to
renovate the Grahm-Lees Dormitories before they
burn to the ground, destroying half the freshman
class. But we wonder if the class will not be forced in-
to a bad situation which could hurt the University and
the class as a whole. Be serious, should a 14 x 9 room
hold two freshmen? Should freshmen be living in a
building with a bar. We urge the administration at
Washington and Lee to take another look at the hous-
ing situation.

Student Criticizes Sawyer

Dear Sir:

As the author of the article
urging students to vote that was
much maligned in last week’s
Ring-tum Phi, I feel obligated to
respond to the rantings of Mr.
C. K. Sawyer. Mr. Sawyer’s
contentions are an insult to the
sensibilities of all American
citizens, and I will not waste
space refuting his narrow,
selfish, shortsighted, and _ir-
responsible attacks on the role
of the American government.

What must be addressed,
however, is Mr. Sawyer’s
dangerous claim that voting
shows compliance with the pre-
sent policies of the federal
government. It does no such
thing. It demonstrates a com-
mitment to the democratic pro-
cess of government. If Mr.
Sawyer is opposed to particular
policies he is free, as are all
voters, to cast a ballot for any of

‘a number of parties that pro-

pose changes in public policy.
As Mr. Sawyer is well aware the
Libertarian Party represents

Spectator:

 

the alternate point of view he
expressed in his letter — he has

been active in distributing in-

formation on libertarianism on,
campus. The party’s candidate
is on the ballot in every state.
Other candidates are running
and promoting communism,
socialism, and yes, even
moderation. The effective
method to indicate a preference
for a change in policy is to vote

for the candidate of one of these
alternate parties.

Mr. Sawyer has urged
students not to vote in order to
express opposition to present
policies. But the vote does not
legitimize these policies — it
legitimizes the democratic pro-
cess. An attack on voting is in-
herently an attack on the
democratic process. An attack
on voting is inherently an attack
on the democratic system of
government. If that is Mr.
Sawyer’s radical change in the
system, I leave him to his grim
task of non-political revolution
and challenge him to quit play-
ing with radicalism. As for
myself, I much prefer to exer-
cise one of the many rights and
freedoms guaranteed by the
federal government to me, Mr.
Sawyer, and all Americans over
eighteen years of age — I will
take time for America and ex-
press my concern by voting in
the November general election.

Great misfortunes...hideous omens. Bad times
have fallen on Lexington and worse ones still to
come. In days gone by, glorious days, Lexington
was blessed with haute cuisine. Lexington, hungry
Lexington, where have all your Swiss Burgers
gone? Central Lunch is no more; Mr. Duck is
gone. And, woe, alas, in place of bacon, cheese,
tomato soybean delight...is, of all misfortunes, a
peanut factory. The infidels from Georgia are in-
vading Little Roma. Jimmy Carter’s campaign
headquarters is now located in Lexington’s most
cherished establishment.

Once you could go to Duck’s for a cold six of
America’s finest. Central Lunch was a symbol of
capitalistic ingenuity: the coldest beer, the
greasiest fries, the cheapest fare. Now Carter
brews insipid moonshine and economic disaster.
But let’s hope that Mr. Duck’s ingenuity and his

success don’t rub off on Carter. Yet, you can hear
that new Carter campaign slogan already ‘Yah
all come back and see us now, yah hear.”’ If Carter
is indeed elected it is because he has usurped, he
has stolen this nation’s most sacred image: the
greasy spoon.

Let’s face the facts, my hedonistic friends. If
Jimmy is elected, you’ll be languishing in the
same old homegrown blues. But if Bonzo’s friend
wins, you'll have a chance to tour the world. Im-
agine a real Afghanistan high! Think of the exotic
colors in a Persian rug; those carpet-weavers
really know what psychedelic. means. Amber
waves of poppy seed...Lebanese and Taiwanese!
So if you’re looking for the best buzz of your life,
then go with Ronnie. Take a trip on the seven seas,
and remember, the marinas are always looking
for a few good fish.
Soccer Star
Makes Apology

Dear Editor,

In reference to my interview
in the October 16 issue of the
Ring-tum Phi, I would like to
make public my apology to
Coach Rolf Piranian. It was due
to my poor judgement that a
grave misunderstanding took
place. I would like to make it
clear that I have the utmost
confidence in Coach Piranian’s
knowledge of all aspects of the
game of soccer.

It is his knowledge and ability
as a coach which is responsible
for our team’s success (6-2 as of
Monday). There have been
games this season that would
have been futile efforts without
Coach Piranian’s knowledge
and foresight. Furthermore, I
believe it must be apparent that
a team which has outscored
its opponents 18-9 has a coach
with exceptional knowledge in
the offensive, as well as the
defensive aspects of the game.
