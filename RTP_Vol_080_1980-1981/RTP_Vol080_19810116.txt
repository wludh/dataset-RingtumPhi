Burns Warns Blacks
Of Increased Racism

Speaking on the eve of what
would have been Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr.’s 52 birthday,
the regional director of the
National Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored People
(NAACP) warned a_ small
audience in Lee Chapel last
night that blacks in America
have the potential of becoming
like the Jews of Nazi Germany

The Rev. Dr. Emmett C.
Burns, regional director of the
NAACP in Virginia, Maryland
and the District of Columbia,
told the mostly black audience
that the United States is looking
for scapegoats and blacks may
be the ones the rest of the
country can blame for today’s
problems.

“The majority is beginning to
look for reasons why they are
doing poorly and I’m afraid
they are blaming the blacks,”
Burns said. “Just look at all the
violence and sudden conser-
vatism in this country.”’

Burns pointed to the wave of
killings in Atlanta, Georgia and
Buffalo, New York, the shooting
of National Urban League
President Vernon Jordan last
year, the increase in Ku Klux
Klan activities and the election
of Ronald Reagan as examples
of increasing hatred for blacks.

He said the majority of people
in the United States see high
taxes, busing to achieve in-
tegration and food stamps
asnothing more than  un-
necessary benefits for blacks at
the expense of white prosperity
and thus, blame the weak
economy on them.

“The future looks bleak for
blacks,” Burns said.

Burns also said he believes
the election of Ronald Reagan,
“whom we fear,’’ means less
for blacks and more for whites
in America. He said proposed
Reagan Administration policies
to aid the slumping economy
will guarantee profits for the

wealthy, maintain the status
quo and take back what blacks
have gained in the past 25
years.

‘Reagan wants to balance the
budget, cut taxes and increase
defense spending,” Burns said.
“Do you know how he’s going to
do this, by taking away what we
have gained.”

Burns’ talk, sponsored by the
Washington and Lee Student
Association for Black Unity and
the Office of Minority Affairs,
was titled “If Dr. King Were
Here—What?” But Burns, who
captivated the audience with
long quotations of poetry and
simulated dialogue with King,
turned the talk into an appeal
for black students at the univer-
sity.

“Now is the time for you,
those lucky to receive a good
education, to rise up and do
what we can for the American
system and for blacks,’’ said.
Burns.

“King died to get you here,
now don’t turn your backs on
your race. You have a
mission,’’ added Burns.

Burns said he believes racism
is “here to stay” and that the
Ku Klux Klan now spreads its
doctrine from ‘‘sea to shining
sea.”’ But he also said blacks

Midterm Reports Spur
New Review Policy

by Bill Whalen

The Executive Committee
passed a measure Monday
night which allows it to review
the financial records of student
organizations. The measure
passed, 8-2, with Senior
representatives Jim Vines and
Marshall Clark dissenting.

The E.C. brought up discus-
sion of a need for financial
review after hearing the
midterm report of the Student
Activities Board. The SAB’s
midterm report failed to list
revenues received from one of
its movies and, when question-
ed by E.C. Vice-President
Willie Mackie, SAB _ Co-
Chairmen Jamie Small and
Price Elam were unaware of
discrepancies involving SAB
accounts.

According to Mackie, the SAB
had been drawing money out of
an account which did not con-
tain any funds. The SAB has
three separate accounts with
the university. Mackie said that
another account paid for the
SAB’s expenses. Small and
Elam said they were unaware

of the empty account and at-.

tributed the mistake to an ac-
counting error.

E.C. President Bob Willis
then said the EC needs a pro-

gram through which its liason
members to student organiza-
tions can review financial
records. Willis also recom-
mended that the Publications
Board take up a similar policy.
“We give you the money,”
said Vines in response to a ques-
tion by Small, ‘‘that gives us the
right to check your books.”’
Elam responded to the E.C.’s
argument, claiming that “the

E.C. should not get involved in

checking what is being done in-
ternally in an organization.
Elam stated that the E.C. has
no right to know ‘“‘how money is
being moved around”’ within an
organization.
Willis then

listed three

 

 

EC Members Frank Smith and Jeff Edwards

reasons for the need for finan-
cial review, including: (1) that
the program allows the E.C. to
“physically look’’ at books, (2)
it allows the E.C. the opportuni-
ty to ‘see specifically the
details of expenditures.”’ (3) it
allows the E.C. ‘“‘the opportuni-
ty to protect organizations by
giving it a seal of approval.”’

Small was clearly angered by
the E.C.’s recommendation,
asking ‘“‘does anybody ever
audit you people?’ Elam voiced
a similar complaint, stating ‘‘I
don’t like anyone looking over
my shoulder.”’

The SAB also announced that
it lost over $2500 for the

Superdance Bands, Events Revealed

by Steven Perry
For the third consecutive
year, Washington and Lee
University is sponsoring a
dance marathon to benefit the
Muscular Dystophy Associa-
tion. As has been the case for
the previous two fund-raisers,
the event will take place in
Evans Dining Hall, from Feb. 6
through Feb. 8. Superdance ’81
consists of 30 hours of virtually
non-stop dancing during which
a fifteen minute break is given
every hour; and a two hour rest
between 4 and 6 on Saturday
morning. The dancers will also
receive free beer throughout
the marathon and five meals.
J.Hemby, co-chairman of
the Dancethon. for the past
three years, says the dance is
going to be better than ever.
Seven bands are scheduled to

' play at the benefit. The dance

kicks off Friday night at 8:00
with the music of Jimmy Bishop
and Turning Point. After three
hours of soul, the Good Humor
Band, a rock group, will play on
into Saturday morning. Satur-
day, after the dancers are given
breakfast, three more live
bands will be presented. From
seven until nine o’clock a
bluegrass band will entertain,

followed by two hours of Reg-
gae music performed by the
band Sunfire. Saturday after-
noon music concludes with
Steve Bassett and the Sweet
Virginia Breeze which will play
four hours of beach music.
Saturday night, the popular
rock band Tracks will play from
6 p.m. until 10 p.m. The final
live band, The Graudeurs and
Act Ill, will play from 10 p.m.
Saturday through 2 a.m. Sun-
day. In all, 22 hours of live
music will be played during the
dance marathon. The intervals
between bands will be followed
by taped music sponsored by
Playback. All seven bands are
playing at reduced rates for
M.D.

Throughout Superdance ’81,
door prizes will be given out to
the dancers. Hemby believes
that the door prizes along with
the live bands will help avoid
the monotony of 28 hours of dan-
cing. The Grand Prize for
Superdance ’81 will be awarded
to the contestant who raises the
most money for the dance
marathon, and includes a vaca-
tion for two in Key West,
Florida. Approximately every
four hours, one dancer or spec-
tator will be permitted to throw

a pie into a faculty member’s
face. This honor will go to the
highest bidder with all proceeds
going toward the Superdance
’81 goal of $20,000.

While many of the basic
features of last year’s Super-
dance remain unchanged, Hem-
by says. two areas that were
overlooked during the previous
years have received greater at-
tention. As co-chairmen of the
Superdance '81 committee,
Hemby and Tripp Brower
sought to increase the involve-
ment of the community of Lex-

ington in the dance-a-thon.
Several of the local civic groups
are donating money and spon-
soring dancers, while food is be-
ing provided by Wendy’s, Ken-
tucky Fried Chicken, Spanky’s,
and Kroger’s. The door prizes
are also being donated by local
merchants.

The Washington and Lee
faculty is also playing a larger
role in the dance-a-thon, with
lacrosse coach ‘Jack Emmer
serving as the faculty advisor of
Superdance °81. 30 secretaries

Huntley To Speak
At ODK Convocation

Robert E.R. Huntley, presi-
dent of Washington and Lee
University, will be the speaker

Hall.
As part of the annual

Founders’ Day ceremonies, a
number of, Washington and Lee
students and prominent alumni

will be inducted into Omicron
Delta Kappa, the national honor .
society recognizing outstanding
leadership. ODK was founded
at Washington and Lee in 1914
and now has chapters on more
than 160 college and university
campuses throughout the na-
tion.

Rupert N. Latture, the sole
surviving founder of ODK and
now assistant to President
Huntley, will participate in the
ceremonies.

IFC States Role of Scholarship Chairmen

by Mike Perry

Inter-fraternity President
Monty Briscoe cautioned frater-
nity leaders last Tuesday night
against initiating freshmen who
did not achieve a 1.9 grade point
average last term.

Briscoe read from a Student
Affairs Committee report two
measures which were adopted
by the University Council and
slated to be effective this year.

The Report states:

‘1. For a student to be in-
itiated into a social fraternity at

Washington and Lee, he shall be
required to be in residence here
for at least one full 12-week
term, with a minimum
cumulative grade point average
of 1.90.

2. Each fraternity shall ap-
point Scholarship Chairmen
whose primary responsibility
shall be to promote an at-
mosphere of scholarly concern
and an environment in which
academic achievement is
respected within the chapter.

As a minimum, his duties shall
be to (a) publish a list of all in-
itiated members and their ma-
jors; (b) publish a list of all in-
itiated members and pledges at
the end of each term, and (c)
provide the Coordinator of
Fraternity Affairs, prior to
each initiation ceremony, with
a list of those persons to

be initiated.”’

Dean of Fraternity Affairs
Dan Murphy stressed to the IFC
that these resolutions were

have volunteered to tabulate
the pledges at the end of the
dance-a-thon in order to ex-
vedite the billing process.

Superdance ’81, with the ex-
ception of Coach Emmer, has
been organized by students. A
steering committee, composed
of 25 members, has been work-

ing on the dance-a-thon since

J. Hemby Muscular Dystrophy D

September. Various sub-
committees involved in organiz-
ing the benefit include the
entertainment, security, and
the liason committees. The
liason committee is a new com-
mittee which has been added to
maintain a line of communica-
tion between the steering Com-
mittee and the _ individual
representatives at the women’s
colleges.

Hemby and Brower stress the
importance of participation on
a large scale by W&L students if
Superdance ’81 is going to meet
its goal of $20,000. They went on
to say that any student or Lex-
ingtonian may participate if
they are 18 or older. The
deadline for registration is
February 6th and all dancers
must have a minimum of $50 in
pledges. Hemby said ‘‘this

dance marathon is a perfect
chance to have a good time and
also benefit those who are less
fortunate, without any cost to
yourself.

Hemby believes that last
year’s net of $19,000 will be sur-
passed. He said ‘‘student
response has been much more
enthusiastic than last year, and
therefore we expect a

It is time to place

Hemby went on to say that all
the women’s colleges and
fraternities are represented.
Each fraternity has agreed to
donate 2 to 3 kegs to the dance
marathon. They have also
avoided scheduling any social
events for the Superdance ’81
weekend. As has been done for
the past two years, the Super-
dance committee will petition

- the meal plan patrons of Evans

Dining Hall in hopes that they
will donate the cost of their
Saturday night meal to Super-
dance ’81. The rest of the meals
will be unaffected by the dance
marathon.

If you have a gripe about the
Student Government, then con-
sider what they’ve done at the

University of Texas and the.

University of Virginia.

Both state schools have decid-
ed through votes of the student
bodies to abolish their student
governments. But these man-
dates are not unique, however,
as several other colleges have
made the same move in the past
two years.

Texas students originally
decided to abolish their govern-
ment in 1978 and similar actions
have taken place on the cam-
puses of the University of
Georgia, Auburn University

adopted by the UC because of
““concern about the direction
fraternities are headed with
regard to academics,”’ warned
fraternities against any at-
tempts to avoid compliance
with the SAC guidelines.

The IFC also passed a motion
calling for each house to donate
two kegs of beer to the Dance
Marathon to be held February
6-8.

The IFC Judicial Board met
to inquire into a complaint lodg-

ed by a Mary Baldwin College
student about the behavior of
members of the Phi Delta Theta
fraternity at a party held there.
Phi Delt Representative Henry
Clay explained that the frater-
nity had paid for all resulting
damages and clean up, adding
that a letter of apology had been
sent to the Dean of Students at
Mary Baldwin. The IFC Board
suggested that the Phi Delts
write another letter to the in-
dividual.

 

Dr. Bruce Herrick, head of
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s economics department,
was recently appointed general
editor of a series of books on
economics to be published by
Butterworths, a_ British
publisher.

The series is entitled ‘‘Butter-
worths Advanced Economics

 

Herrick Named Editor

Texts’’ and will be produced
with the aid of an international
group of consulting editors.

The first book in the series,
“Projects, Policies, and
Strategies: Cases in Economic
Development’? by Michael
Roemer and Joseph Stern of
Harvard University, will be
published in April.

 

 

participated in the dance
marathon, and over a thousand
people watched as $24,000 was
pledged. Unfortunately, only 75
percent of the money pledged
was ever collected. Hemby
believes that the reason this
figure was so low was because
several students were not

aware of where the money was
going. Of all the money col-
lected from the Superdance,
83.5 percent of the funds went
directly to research and
medical services, while only
16.5 percent of the money was
allocated to fund raising and
management.

End Government

~

and Northern Colorado (Nor-
thern Colorado? ).

At Virginia, a record 60 per-
cent of eligible student voters
turned out to kill the Campus
Council, one of the two houses
which make up U.Va.’s student
government. One member of
the deceased council claims
that students perceive the C.C.
as “a worthless _ institution
(which) slimey politicos see as
an avenue to power and
prestige.”

Critics of U.Va.’s system
maintain that the Campus
Council served mostly as an
organization which gave money
to groups which were rejected

elsewhere. Students also claim
that the C.C. was beneficial only
to students who wanted to play
big-time politician.

According to that same coun-
cil member, the U.Va. vote is.
indicative of a “growing desire
in schools across the nation to
emphasize what universities
are for: studying and scholar-
ships - not politics.’’

Students at Texas, home of
Longhorns and _ Longnecks,
seem to have abandoned all
respect for student government
years ago. In 1977, for example,
a student won the campus
presidential election simply by
wearing a clown suit.

“Why it’s squeezably soft,’’ the

might use up all 11,122 rolls. But
even this is no large order for a

of paperdom are renowned for
their awesome consumption
and revered for their profound

curious to find out whether they

inspecting the elevator, found

Marsh commented that it was
extremely unusual not only that
someone would make a bomb

be able to put a call through to

The ‘Best Three’ of 1980

by John Wells

The year just past probably won't be
remembered as anyone’s greatest and the cinema
is no exception. Actually the list of real stinkers
far outweighs those films with any redeeming
features, but then this is usually the case. At any
rate, I find myself unable to come up with a “‘top
ten’’ list due to the following reasons: however you
look at it, most films really were far below the
average in quality last year; Lexington and my
own hometown tend to have limited facilities and
selection of films.

The best of the films I’ve seen in 1980:

Coal Miner’s Daughter — Sissy Spacek is
remarkable as country singer Loretta Lynn. I’ve
never been wild about Hee Haw or Opryland, but
the eloquent simplicity displayed in an evocative
visual showcase make this a truly outstanding
film. Tommy Lee Jones and particularly Beverly
d’Angelo as Patsy Cline are excellent. Sissy
Spacek appears to be a shoo-in for the best actress
Oscar.

Ordinary People — Robert Redford’s directoral
debut is distinguished by superlative perfor-
mances from the entire cast. While the folks here
are ordinary neither financially or emotionally,

the film is full of very familiar and beautifully
captured human expression. Everything about the
movie rings true, from the people to their clothes
and furniture, and its frightening to realize that
the Mary Tyler Moore part is not at all a
caricature.

The Empire Strikes Back — Technically
superior and genuinely entertaining, a bit more
sober than its predecessor. Frankly I think the
whole sci-fi thing is becoming a bit tiresome.

A thin line-up, admittedly, but it excludes
foreign films and I was unable to see Raging Bull
or My Bodyguard both of which may well have
made the list. Of course none of these would be ap-
pealing to the movie goer who considered The
Blue Lagoon and Any Which Way You Can to be
the outstanding achievements of the year past.

The biggest disappointments of 1980:

Wise Blood — Bizarre, unclear and not com-
pletely faithful to the Flannery O’Conner story,
John Huston’s latest contains some fine acting by
Brad Dourif and, briefly, Ned Beatty. O’Conner
once wrote that she was pleased when an old lady
told her that reading Wise Blood left a bad taste in
her mouth. The film version leaves a weird taste

Film Notes

Frenzy (1972) Alfred Hitchcock returned to England to film what
turned out to be his next-to-last movie about a series of bizarre
stranglings in London. It’s interesting to see how Hitch worked in a
freer, less restricted environment under a considerably more
liberal code by the Motion Picture Association of America.
Presented by the SAB Friday through Sunday, January 16-18, at 7
and 9p.m. in duPont Auditorium. Admission is $1.

The Marriage of Maria Braun (1979) One of the new German
films by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, a complete discussion of
which appears on these pages. Presented by the Film Society Fri-
day and Saturday at 8 p.m. in classroom ‘‘A”’ of Lewis Hall.

 

 

 

 

Film Society Presents Fassbinder Classic

by Carren O. Kaston

The Washington and Lee Film
Society is pleased to present as
its fourth movie of the season
Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s
The Marriage of Maria Braun
(Germany, 1978). It will be
shown Friday, January 16, and
Saturday, January 17, at 8 P.M.
in classroom ‘‘A”’ of Lewis Hall,
free of charge.

Fassbinder is the most pro-
lific and diversely gifted of the
new West German directors,
and Maria Braun is his thirty-
second film in ten years. Often
experimental to the point of
recklessness, Fassbinder here
successfully combines

melodrama, slapstick, soap
opera, the panoramic historical
sweep of an epic, and black
comedy. Other movies directed
by him which have appeared at
Washington and Lee include
Chinese Roulette (1976), shown
our first year, and Fox and His
Friends (1975), shown last year.
Maria Braun is by all
measurements his best. It is a
movie that changes one’s ideas
about what movies can do.
During World War II in Ger-
many, a man leaves his new
bride to rejoin the fighting. The
movie concerns the daring,
anti-social assertions of style
and will by which the wife,

Maria Braun, survives the war
and makes her way up in Ger-
man society after receiving the
news that her husband is dead.
Her resourceful struggle to sur-
vive and her compromising suc-
cess coincide with and com-
ment upon the German
“economic miracle,’’ the post-
war period of recovery and
revitalization.

Morally explosive, Maria
Braun retains an unassailable
moral purity. Yet this purity
ultimately clarifies as a form of
coldness and, at the end, when
she and her husband are
reunited, they can hardly feel
anything. Most of all, Maria

desires still to control her
destiny, suddenly revealed to be
beyond her arrangement. The
film ends as it began, with an
explosion, which perhaps
foreshadows a political disaster
only different in kind from that
of the Hitler years.
Fassbinder’s admiration for
the energy of his heroine
(played with vulnerable
toughness by Hanna Schygulla)
leads him, despite reservations,
to charge the comic esprit of her
social ascent, and its volup-
tuous rigor, with the full play of
his technical inventiveness. The
camera work is elegent and wit-
ty in an almost literary way. In

one remarkable scene, we see

‘tobacco leaves at the end of a

cigarette in a close-up so huge
that they become more real and
beautiful than we ever imagin-
ed so ordinary a reality could
be. Fassbinder himself appears
in the film as a peddler.

The Film Society’s next
movie is Eric Rohmer’s com-
edy Claire’s Knee (France,
1970), scheduled for Friday,
February 6, and Saturday,
February 7. The three movies to
be shown after that will be
selected at a meeting of the
Film Society open to all
members and scheduled for
Thursday, January 29, at 7:30
P.M. in Payne 3.
 

 

A Guide to
_ The Blues

by Robin C. Meredith

One of the few things most theoretically-minded critics can agree
upon is the standard doctrine that rock’n’roll began as an
amalgamation of various elements of urban blues, country, and
jazz. Indeed, listening to records as diverse as the old big band
classic In The Mood, Hank Williams’ Move it on Over, and any
number of early Chicago blues numbers, it’s easy to imagine a
young Chuck Berry or Elvis Presley growing up hearing all these
things on the radio and piecing together a unique vision of popular
music that set the stage for all modern rock’n’roll.

The funny thing is, once rock’n’roll established itself as
(arguably) the most important development in the history of
American popular music, three things happened: 1) jazz shifted
radically to the left through the experimental work of John Col-
trane and Ornette Coleman 2) country music continued on its reac-
tionary, purist path throughout the ’60’s (remember, Dolly Parton
was ostracized for adding strings to her records in 1963 (3) the blues
entered into a holding pattern of sorts — every little blues work of
any great import was done during the ’60’s.

In the early ’70’s, however, a blues revival began which has con-
tinued sporadically since then. The old forms were still there, to be
sure, but the bluesmen of the early ’70’s showed-that they had been
listening to, and had learned from, what the Rolling Stones, the
Yardbirds, Jimi Hendrix, and others had done to widen the boun-
daries of blues playing.

Over the years, rock has had a significant, but largely pernicious,
influence on jazz. So-called ‘‘jazz-rock fusion’’ degenerated into
formulaic crap faster than any trend in recent memory. Country
has also changed over the past five years to the point where the
distinction between pop and country in many cases appears ar-
bitrary. But the whole ‘‘crossover syndrome’’ represents little
more than a search for bigger bucks and wider acceptance by a few
artists.

In contrast, blues and rock have consistently reinforced each
other in a positive fashion. Blues are everywhere, in one per-
mutated form or another, from Dire Straits to Steve Forbert to Pat
Travers. Also, thanks to bands like the Nighthawks, Allstars, Cat-
fish Hodge, and others, blues are gaining an increasing amount of
acceptance among rock fans at a grassroots level. -

There is one big problem here. As Amy O'Neal pointed out in a re-
cent issue of Living Blues, a rather fanatical Chicago-based blues
publication, most of the folks who go nuts over blues in live perfor-
mance would never think of going home and buying a blues record.
One reason for this is that blues record-hunting is anything but
easy; lousy production, misguided management, record company
deletion policies, and the fact that most stores just don’t stock the
damn things are only a few of the obstacles the rookie blues hound
must surmount. So, for those of you who might be interested in
making the jump from barroom blues to turntable blues, here is my
own five-step beginners’ guide to the blues:

1) The Nighthawks — Open All Nite — This record comes first,
not because it contains any truly definitive performances, but
rather because of the encyclopedic song selection. Muddy Waters,
Sonny Boy Williamson, Elmore James, Jimmy Reed and Junior
Parker are all represented by their best numbers, performed in a
style that should go down quite well with most rock-oriented ears.

2) Albert Collins — Ice Pickin’ and Frostbite.

3) Fenton Robinson — Somebody Loan Me A Dime and I Hear
Some Blues Downstairs.

4) Son Seals — Live & Burning, and Chicago Fire — All three of
these guys are black, young (when it comes to black bluesmen,
anything under 50 is positively juvenile), Texas-born guitarists. In
fact, they’re all hot guitarists, each in his own way, Seals being the
most fiery and rock-influenced, Collins the funkiest and most in-
novative, and Robinson the must traditional and refined. These are
all excellent modern blues records, solidly produced, featuring
mostly original material. (See GUIDE, p. 8)

Natural Bridge, a jazz-rock

will perform in the Cockpit Fri-
day night at 8 p.m. No cover will
be charged of Washington and
Lee students.

Natural Bridge consists of
five musicians: Greg Karukas,
keyboards; Wink Robinson,
guitar; Mike Manring, bass;
Joe Dougherty, drums; and
Steve Bloom, percussion.

The group plays its own com-
positions as well as classic jazz

works. Its sound is a blend of
jazz, progressive rock and
Latin styles.

Washington-area critics have
had a generally favorable reac-
tion to the music of Natural
Bridge. Harry Sumrall of the
Washington Post described it as
‘‘a new sound that is warm and
rich in musical detail. The
Washington Star’s Tim Warren
said, ‘‘One of the group’s major
plauses is that its members
take obvious care in their

music; their compositions are
painstakingly arranged.”’

Natural Bridge has shared
the stage with stellar musicians
such as be-bop giant Sonny
Stitt, vocalists Melba Moore
and Angela Bofill, and Brazilian
masters Egberto Gismonti and
Nana Vasconcelos. In addition
to its concert performances,
Natural Bridge has been work-
ing on its first album, ‘‘Free
Sample.”

Blues guitarist Bob Margolin
will play in the Cockpit next
Wednesday night. Although
Margolin has been periodically

, backed up by the Nighthawks

during the last three years he is
now touring with his own group
of musicians. This group calls
itself the Bob Margolin Blues
Band,

The guitarist was born in

Boston, Mass., in 1949 toa

This

certainly

musical family
background | has

shown in his talent and career.
Margolin played and recorded
with Muddy Waters for seven
years as Waters’ lead guitarist
and chief associate. Before this
period ended in 1980 Margolin
appeared on six Muddy Waters
albums. Four of these,
Woodstock Album, Hard Again,

i'm Ready, and Muddy
Mississippi Waters Live won
Grammy Awards. Margolin
even played bass guitar on I’m

Ready.

The Todd Hobin Band (Jan. 17
in the Cockpit), has matured in-
to a powerful, straight-ahead
group of rock and rollers,
without losing the intimate ap-
proach to performing that has
earned them a loyal following
all along the east coast. Todd
has refined a dynamic and in-
tense brand of rock and roll,
while retaining the unique, per-
sonal style of writing and play-
ing that has consistently im-
pressed audiences and critics
quickly developed into upstate
New York’s favorite. After
several radio broadcasts
brought their music to mass au-
diences, Todd Hobin became a
top telephone request on many ~
stations. Their first album, en-
titled The Todd Hobin Band,
followed shortly. It almost im-
mediately sold out, by word of
mouth and strong airplay.
Featuring New York Country
Sons and I Hate You, the album
alike. After New York City per-
formances, Variety declared
that this ‘First rate rock com-
bo...is most impressive.’ In
Buffalo, the Courier Express
added ‘‘good, hard, clean rock’n

“‘excellent.”’

Commentary

The Hype

by Ralph Frasca

Oakland and Philadelphia.
Philadelphia and Oakland. Jim
Plunkett’s “amazing’’ come-
back. Wilbert Montgomery’s
knee. Dan Pastorini’s possible
retirement. Dick Vermeil’s
“rah-rah”’ coaching methods.
Harold Carmichael’s favorite
color. Whether the heartbreak
of psoriasis will be a major fac-
tor in the final score.

Who really cares?

Unless you’ve just returned
from a stint as a Tibetan Monk,
you're aware of the celebrated
participants in the annual
Pigskin Parade who, in little
more than a week, will be par-
ticipating in what may be the
most relentlessly hyped event
in sports.

A week from Sunday NBC, in
their unmistakable Proud-as-a-
Peacock style, will bring us the
game in living color. Unfor-
tunately, the game is to be
preceded by hours of inane pre-
game chatter, in which a broad-
caster who sounds like he’s on
uppers, a few dumb ex-jocks,
and a woman whose knowledge
of sports would fit on an insignia
ring, will try to tell us what
we'll see, based on their self-
proclaimed ‘‘expertise.’’ The
appalling thing about these
odious pre-game assaults on our
intelligence is the sheer worth-
lessness of the information. By
telling us about who pulled what
muscle, by telling us the heart-
warming story of how some
player’s mother is suffering
from a hangnail and how the
athlete vows to ‘win it for
Mom,” and by burdening us
with reams of meaningless
statistics, these incessantly
jovial broadcast types and
“color analysts’ (who neither
analyze very well nor are the

least bit colorful) are attemp-
ting to arm us for the epic
gladiatorial struggle we are for-
tunate enough to witness. Per-
sonally, I’d just rather watch
the game.

Ah, but wait! There are still
more dullards who would have
a crack at plain old football
fans. This seedy lot is known as
the media, which includes jour-
nalists, ad men, and promoters
among its chief offenders. They
would have us caught up in the
“drama” of it all, much in the
same way as alarming numbers
of bored housewives involve
themselves in someone else’s
problems by watching soap
operas. For these individuals,
the entire game boils down to
‘Them Against Us,”’ ‘The Good
Guys Versus the Bad Guys,’ and
“The Joy of Victory and the
Agony of Defeat.’’ These bas-
tions of mediocrity imply that
there is some hidden moral in-
volved in the proceedings, as in
Grimm’s Fairy Tales.

Please don’t get me wrong.
I’m a dyed-in-the-wool football
fan whose eyes will be glued to
the set next Sunday, just like
everyone else, but my objection
regards the silly hype with
which we are bombarded, the
endless sea of meaningless
refuse which we must wade
through in order to watch the
Super Bowl. Vague moral im-
plications and _ worthless
analysis (’’Gee, Pat, I believe
that the team which can get the
ball into the endzone most often
is almost sure to win’’) are
nothing more than a conspiracy
to lull this nation into a state of
numbed listlessness.

One last thing — I pick
Philadelphia to win, 30-24.

 

Cagers Whip Hampden-Sydney,

Win W&L Invitational

by Dale Park

With the ‘‘Unknown Fans hex-
ing the Hampden-Sidney Tigers
into a 33 percent free throw
shooting performance, the
Washington and Lee varsity
basketball team rolled to an
82-59 victory over the Tigers
Tuesday night at Warner
Center.

The victory avenged W&L’s
57-55 loss to H-SC earlier this
season and improved the
Generals’ ODAC record to 1-1.
The Generals are now 9-3
overall.

‘“The Unknown Fans’”’ did a
great job and the crowd was ter-

rific,’”’ commented 17th year
head coach Verne Canfield, who
saw his team overcome a poor
first-half peformance to rout
Sydney. ‘‘In the first half we

tried to overpower H-SC,”’ said
Canfield, “‘but this team cannot
overpower anyone. We _ just
calmed down and played our

 

 

game in the second half - and
gradually built up a lead.”’

Although the Generals shot
only 42 percent from the field in
the first half (compared with
Sydney’s 65 percent), W&L held
a slim 33-30 halftime advan-
tage. But in the second half, the
H-SC shooting cooled off and a
tough W&L defense kept the
Tigers from moving the ball in-
side.

Noted Canfield: ‘‘We switch-
ed team defenses - first a
halfcourt trap, then going with
a team man-to-man, and kept
them guessing.’’

At 12:35 in the second half,
senior co-captain Carby Hoy hit
a jumper to give W&L a 37-34
lead. Hoy’s basket sparked a
nine-minute period in which the
Generals outscored H-SC, 20-6.
The W&L’s shooting had heated
up to 61 percent while Sydney
had fallen to 37 percent.

Leading the W&L effort was

,

 
   

 

Guard George Spears in action for the Generals

senior center Rob Smitherman.
Smitherman scored a game-
high 19 points and grabbed
seven rebounds. Hoy followed
with 14 points, while sophomore
forward Brian Hanson and
junior guard George Spears
scored 11 and 10 points, respec-
tively.

Canfield explained that “‘this
game gives us the momentum
we wanted as we enter our
ODAC schedule. Canfield also
claimed that this year, his team
has played ‘“‘one of the toughest
pre-ODAC schedules ever.”’

This past weekend, W&L fac-
ed two tough non-ODAC teams
in the 12th annual Washington
and. Lee Invitational Tourna-
ment.

The Generals claimed the ti-
tle with convincing wins over
St. Andrews College (79-72) in
the first round and Davis &
Elkins (68-52) in the champion-
ship game. _

Against St. Andrews, every
member of the W&L “‘blue’’, or
starting five, squad scored in
double figures. Hoy led his team
with a game-high 20 points,
while Spears scored 16. Both
Smitherman and Hanson con-
tributed 10 points apiece and
senior co-captain R.J. Scaggs
netted 12.

In the championship game, _
W&L committed few fouls and
turnovers as Hoy again led his
team, this time with 16 points.
Smitherman scored 15 points,
followed by Spears, who added
10.

In addition, junior guard
Clark New, the team’s sixth
man, contributed 12 points from
the bench as W&L coasted to the
victory.

Both Hoy and Smitherman
were named to the five-man All-
Tournament team.

‘“‘We have won all but one of
our home games,’’ remarked
Canfield,”’ and that is very im-
portant because the next few
teams we will be facing at home
want to beat us very bad.”

Three Wrestlers Quit ,W&L Loses Tournament

by John Harrison

It is not an insignificant oc-
currence when three members
of the same athletic team leave
their team. Such an action will
inevitably affect the rest of the
team, whether it causes resent-
ment, bitterness or even indif-
ference. Another effect is that
the team’s expectations will
undergo serious alteration for
the remainder of the season.

Such is the case with the W&L
wrestling team. Since Friday,
sophomore Barry Thompson,
junior Elbert Umila, and junior
co-captain Mike McFadden
have notified coach Gary
Franke that they have decided
to quit the team.

What makes this situation so

different from other cases of
W&L athletes leaving a team,
especially in mid-season, is the
feeling of uneasiness which per-
vades. The problem not only in-
volves the fact that the team is
seriously short-handed; a ma-
jor cause of concern is_ the
reasons which led the three

wrestlers to depart.

The decisive factor for Umila
and Thompson was a question
of academics. Franke com-
mented, ‘‘Neither were
satisfied with their grades and
thus they felt it would be best to
quit.”’ Franke added this about
Thompson: ‘After playing for
the football team, I don’t
believe that he was ready to

give the necessary time and

energy to a second sport. In
other words, he felt that one
sport was enough for him.”’

As for McFadden, his deci-
sion was prompted by a recurr-
ing knee injury. The general
consensus was that he would be
able to return after the
Christmas break, but it was
after he defeated freshman Tim
Valliere in a match to deter-
mine who would start in the 158-
pound class that he decided to
pack it in. McFadden said that
he had thought it over before
Christmas and decided that. it
wouldn’t be worth risking
another knee injury.

According to several team-
mates, the feelings between

McFadden and Franke were
strained and testy. Their
philosophies about how the

practices should be run and how
the team should be treated were
not compatible. One source
stated that coach Franke said
McFadden “‘couldn’t suck it up.
He was cowardly, and worried-
too much about pain.”’

How does Franke feel about
losing three important
wrestlers? ‘‘As a Division III
university which does not offer
athletic scholarships, a player
is free to leave the team at any
time. Because we recieve very
little publicity outside of the
school, it takes guts for a stu-
dent to come out for a sport.

Therefore, I really don’t think
this quitting business is that big
a deal.”
As a result of being short-
handed, the Generals forfeited
three weight classes to Duke
and two to Campbell College in
last Saturday’s meet in Warner
Center. In the matches which
did take place, Duke outclassed
both of its opponents. Campbell
needed the aforementioned
forfeits to defeat W&L 32-20.
Strong performances were
turned in by freshmen Tim
Valliere and Scott Mason.

W&L’s next match will take

place this Saturday in
Charleston, South Carolina
against the Citadel.
Life of a Wrestler

by Scott Mason

Editor’s Scott
Mason is a freshman wrestler at
WEL.

At precisely 3:45 every day a
group of about twelve young
men assemble for approximate-
ly two hours in a_ small,
rectangular-sized room. When
they come out their shirts are
drenched with sweat, their
arms ache, their legs feel like
lead, and, in general, they are
drained of all physical energy.
The room is 114 on the fourth
level of the Doremus Gym-
nasium, and the 12 young men
are Washington and Lee
wrestlers.

Many people do not enjoy
watching a wrestling match,
finding it dull, boring, and often
ridiculous. However, the thing
which seems to move the spec-
tator is the ‘“‘blood and guts”
element of the sport. Several
times I have seen the mouth of a
fan gape in astonishment as he
watches two opponents battle
with intensity. Spectators
marvel as both wrestlers ex-
haust every muscle in their
body until it seems as if neither
is able to stand, yet somehow
seem to reach down deep inside
and literally crawl back onto
the mat. Wrestlers are often
asked why they have such a
desire to punish themselves.
Perhaps the answer lies outside
the action taking place on the
mat.

The life of a wrestler is by no
means glamorous and I’m sure

Sports note:

that all wrestlers have, at one
time or another, wondered why
they chose to put themselves
through the tortures of wrestl-
ing. Aside from the physically
gruelling aspects of the sport,
wrestlers must sacrifice vast
amounts of time, starve
themselves in order to make
their designated weight class,
and inevitably experience the
nauseousness and butterflies in
the pit of the stomach just
before a match. Yet that which
almost always triumphs over
the pain and suffering of a
wrestler is the keen sense of
pride and determination which
binds a team together, and
which makes an_ individual
“‘suck it up”’ and go for more. It
is this same pride which
Washington and Lee coach
Gary Franke has often spoken
of during a typical rigorous
practice when he implores his
wrestlers to “‘take pride in what
you’re doing.”

The 1981 Generals may not be
a powerhouse or even a league
threat, but maybe winning is
not really what it’s all about.
Perhaps there is another type of
“winning” which manifests
itself in a wrestler’s ability to
overcome the sacrifices which
wrestling demands and to know
just how big a heart he really
has.

Whether the season is marked
by success or failure, one must
look beyond the mere team
record and understand the real

mark to 2-1.

“According to the scouting
reports, they should have
beaten us. But, we got some
super performances out of Jeff
Gee and Herb Gresens,”’
remarked Coach Page
Remillard, in addition to ‘‘solid
performances from the rest of

Indeed, Gee’s performance
was nothing short of spec-

Smitherman Develops Into

The Generals’ Big Man

by Ed Gonsalves

It may have been a long road
to travel, but Rob Smitherman
has arrived as a_ basketball
player.

A 6-7, 195-pound center for
Washington
Generals, he has progressed
from a self-acknowledged in-
ferior high school player to
peer- and coach-acknowledged
superior small college standout.
The three-year letterman and
‘wo -year W&L starter has
yecome one of the top big men
around.

“Overall, in high school I was
lousy,” begins the Mt. Jackson,
Va. product on the transition. “I
never really added anything of-
fensively to the game because I

was primarily a _ defensive
player. Since coming to W&L, I
feel I’ve improved physically
and matured as a ballplayer.”’

He began his W&L playing
days as a reserve center,
averaging 5.5 points and 4.7 re-
bounds as a freshman who did
manage to see action in all 28
contests. Having earned a star-
ting position as a sophomore, he
responded with 7.2 points and
6.0 rebounds per game. Last
winter the constantly improv-.
ing athlete poured in 11.1 points
and pulled down 7 rebounds per
contest, blocked 43 shots, and
led W&L in rebounding in 13 of
29 games.

‘When Rob came here four
years ago, he was timid and

   
  
 

  
    

    

NRE tintin

 

  

shy, afraid of contact,’ ex-
plains W&L head coach Verne
Canfield. ‘‘Now he has con-
fidence in himself as an in-
dividual and as a basketball
player.

“‘He’s developed a nice shot
for a big man and has become
an outstanding defensive
center,’ the Generals’ 17th-
year coach continues. ‘‘He does
an excellent job of what we call
‘helping’ by constantly backing
up everybody on the court.
“He's definitely the best big
man in our conference.”’

Smitherman came to W&L
primarily to play basketball.

“I came knowing that I would
get a chance to play within a
couple of years,’’ he offers, ad-
ding that “if I wanted to go to
school strictly for academics, I
would have gone to a state col-
lege.”’

Academics, however, have
also become part of Smither-
man’s forte. A history major, he
holds a prestigious Robert E.
Lee Scholarship and a plus-3.00
grade point average. The 1977
Stonewall Jackson Academy
graduate also participated in a
foreign study program, travel-
ling to Germany following his
junior season on the basketball
court.

     
   
    

dividual medley (2:04.71) and
200 backstroke (2:05.49),
registering victories both
times. Coach Remillard praised
the freshman’s rapid progress
this year. “Jeff is already
becoming a great swimmer. |
expect him to qualify for the
Nationals in two or three events
before long.’’

Co-captain Herb Gresens was
instrumental in the 400-meter
free-style relay victory and the
fine time in the 400 medley
relay.

All-American Mike Bernot,
freshman Tim Rock, and junior

Rob Crawford also posted:

outstanding times. Bernot cap-
tured the top prize in his two
specialty events — the 100 and
200 free-style. Rock also won
twice, in the 590 and 1000 free.
Crawford, a man of diversified
talents, finished first in the 200
breaststroke and second in the

1000 free and 200 individual
medley.

These outstanding
achievements were capped off
by a surprising effort from
freshman diver’ Richard
Rosser. Rosser placed first in
the three-meter diving and se-
cond in the one-meter diving.

Coach Remillard expects that
the great times turned in
against George Washington will
move the General swimmers
higher in the NCAA Division III
rankings. As of Jan. 7, Bernot
claimed the best time in the 200

free and second best in the 50
and 100 free. Rock was first in
the 500 free and second in the
1000 free event.

The swimmers face tough
Division I competition this
weekend away at James
Madison and Towson State.
They will return home Jan. 24
against Shepherd College.

‘Bus Boys’ Billboard Review

THE BUS BOYS—"‘Minimum
Wage Rock’n Roll,” Arista
AB4280.

(“I bet you never heard
music like this by spades.’’) So
sings Brian O'Neal on the Bus
Boys’ debut album. The only
problem with this is that he fails
to say rock'n'roll this fresh and
witty is made by few people of
any color.

The hard rocking “Dr.
Doctor’’ is an inviting opening
to the primarily black group’s
intoxicating meshing of styles.
Punctuated by an_ infectious
guitar riff, the song shows the
Bus Boys’ musical chops are up
to snuff.

It’s not until ‘Minimum
Wage’ though that the lyrical
talents of brothers Brian and
Kevin O’Neal—lead
vocalist/keyboards player and
lead
respectively— came to the
forefront. (‘How can I find
peace of mind/I’m not even liv-
ing on my own time/When
something's done wrong, what
can I say?/Someone could send
me back home today.’’)
Though performed in a
humorous, tongue firmly in
cheek manner, as is all the
album, the song touches on the

vocalist/bassist —

insecurities of contemporary
working class living. A sizzling
guitar solo by Victor Johnson
accentuates the track.

In “Did You See Me?’’ the
band mixes a_ stereotypical
black situation with one that is
atypical. Brian O'Neal plays a
“Shoe shine boy” who gets into
the new wave scene. That this
is danceable makes it even
more worthwhile.

Turning life inside out is the
Bus Boys’ speciality. In ‘There
Goes The Neighborhood,” a
black man is upset that whites
are moving into his area. (‘‘I
ain’t moving out for no Carol
and Bob/The inner city is too
close to my job,’’) complains
Brian O’Neal in one of the
album’s stellar cuts.

“Johnny Soul’d Out,” the
stand-out live track, loses
something in translation onto
vinyl. This 1950’s styled rocker
clicks in conjunction with the
onstage antics of the band.
Here, it is rather routine.

All is forgiven though on
“KKK,” which says more in its
short 1:41 minutes than most
songs three times its length.
Beginning with the recitation of
the Pledge of Allegiance over a
breakneck rock beat, it moves

into Kevin O'Neal's lament that
his skin color shouldn't hinder
him from joining that “all
American” organization, the
Klan.

On side two, ‘‘Anggie’’ is one
of the most rewarding cuts
musically. Here, Steve Felix’s
pounding drums serve to rein-
force the dynamics of the song.
Lyrically, this is a standard
boy-needs-girl plea.

Nuclear disaster is the focal
point of “‘D-Day.’’ Spearheaded
by the funky synthesizer work
of Michael Jones, the realities
of that modern day Franken
stein are shoved into the
listener’s face.

The trials of being working
class are explored again in ‘‘We
Stand United.’’ Set over a rock-
disco rhythm, Brian plays a
cocky guy who doesn’t know
what he wants but knows what
he doesn’t want. (‘Don’t want
to be no office boy/No
lightweight actors standup
toy,’’) he asserts.

The album ends with the
rock'n'roll gem _ ‘‘Respect.”’
While the lyrics may not be
suitable for some, the song con-
veys the Bus Boy’s disrespect
for boundaries of any kind.

The Todd Hobin Band

(continued from page 5)

was critically acclaimed.

The record’s success resulted
in a major break. The band was
selected to perform in the
Eastern conference of the Na-
tional Entertainment and Cam-
pus Activities Association
(NECAA) showcase. This led to
an invitation to perform on the
Mainstage showcase of the
NECAA in Washington D.C. The
NECAA conferences’ are
organized conventions that give
college programmers the op-
portunity to check out various
acts for potential booking.
Previous performers include
Linda Ronstadt, Boz Scaggs,
Chicago, and Earth Wind and
Fire.

The Todd Hobin Band is Todd
Hobin on guitar and keyboards,
Desi Desnoyers on bass, Bruce
Fowler on guitar, Shawn Hobin
on drums and Doug Moncrief on
guitar and keyboards. All con-
tribute superb vocals in addi-
tion to talented instrumentals.
The band’s distinct brand of
hard-driving yet personal
rock’n roll attests to their
fraternal as well as musical
tightness.

After 5 years of successful
performances, Todd’s . music
has evolved. Powerful and
melodic rockers, the band’s
style is vocal and tasty, yet

lacks nothing in dynamic rock’n.

roll. The band’s new album
Passion and the Pain, is the
perfect example of the polished,

gutsy energy that is the Todd
Hobin Band. Passion and the
Pain, is recorded evidence of
the band’s transformation into
inspiring and inspired artists.

(continued from page 5)

both produced by Johnny
Winter. Rolling Stone credits
these albums and Waters with a
revival of the blues. Obviously
much of this credit belongs also
to Margolin as Waters’ right
hand man.

While most of Bob Margolin’s
playing has been with Muddy
Waters he has recorded with
several other blues artists such
as the Nighthawks, Johnny
Winter, and Big Joe Duskin.

Do not think that Chicago
blues is all Bob Margolin can
play. He has also joined rock
and roll stars The Rolling
Stones, the Allman Brothers,
Bonnie Raitt, Eric Clapton, and
Bob Dylan. With this
background some may question
Margolin’s style, but the
prevailing influence has been
that of Muddy Waters. Bob
Margolin brings his unique
touch to blues and to rock and
roll. His talent is remarkable in
both kinds of music.

The Blues

(continued from page 5)

5) B.B. King — Live at the Regal — This 1964 classic takes us as
far back as we will go this time. This is slick stuff, very urban, horn
rather than guitar-based, possibly the best example of the work of
the most popular, individual, and, in some spheres, influential

bluesmen of the past twenty years.

We stop at 1964 simply because most records made before that
time suffer from primitive production (don’t forget, Chess Records
never made much money, and their Chicago studios were far from
state-of-the-art) that is just too much for ears weaned on high-tech
studio rock’n’roll. However, a few weeks ago Mark Wenner of the
Nighthawks recommended a few old Muddy Waters, Sonny Boy
Williamson, and Junior Wells records to me. I'll talk about these
and others pre-1965 recordings in part two of this series a few weeks

from now.

Sharman Qn Politics

by Jack Sharman

The umbilical cord of the New Year has been duly cut, most of the
drunks have sobered somewhat and returned to rewarding profes-
sions or stimulating academia, and President Carter winds down
his benumbing incumbency with all the grace of Arlo Guthrie at a
Shriners’ Convention. The Coming year may harbor more glad
tidings than the preceding one, and the actions of the President-
elect encourage hope, although the media have attempted to belit-
tle the incoming crew by focusing attention on everything from
Nancy’s haste to move into the White House to the simian Publick’s
disinclination to wear the semiformal attire that Reagan has called
for at the Inaugration, although such disinclination may be
justified, since stuffing the average Senator, staff member, party
leader, or socialite into civilized clothing is like unto putting a can
of Diet Dr. Pepper in a Chivas Regal sack.

But, lest we forget where we came from, as the Rastafarians and
the Ku Klux Klan are fond of saying, let us recall what took place in
1980.

Iraq and Iran, two of the globe’s more enlightened states, had
great pity on the rest of the world and started a war between
themselves, and the Soviet Union, ever caught up in the spirit of
Helsinki, invaded Afghanistan, an action wholly justified since the
Afghan military-industrial complex constitutes a no doubt grave
threat to Soviet security. In Miami, citizens played the fun family
game of ‘‘Race Riot,’’ and Yankee ingenuity held fast in the deserts
of Iran when an attempt to recue the hostages failed.

The year 1980 also gave us John Anderson, Presidential can-
didate, puerile reformer, and heir to the inter-twined myths of
Merlin and the Brothers Grimm. Teddy Ken-

the cast and the $40-million budget could’ve pro-

they’re strung together by hours and hours of

and sex and sex and sex and sex and it ain’t free!

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Three Sides

It seems there are three sides to every story in
which a conflict occurs. In the instance of our less
than gracious Rhodes Scholar, we have Bill Whalen’s
story which contains some outrageous comments Ed
Johnson made. Then we have Ed Johnson’s rebuttal
and accusation that in some places Whalen
‘paraphrased’ and and sanctioned the paraphrased
comments with quotation marks. The truth, or third
side to every story, probably lies somewhere between
Whalen’s story and Johnson’s rebuttal, but much
closer to the original story written by Whalen.

Whalen was nice enough not to add another com-
ment Johnson made. ‘I don’t care what you print,
I'm leaving this place Friday,” said Johnson.

Reflecting on Johnson’s scholarship and remarks, I
can't help but think he certainly is not Rhodes
Scholarship material. Chip Nunley, who recently won
an NCAA scholarship, is Rhodes Scholar material;
Jeff Edwards, third-year law representative to the
Executive Committee, is Rhodes Scholarship
material. But Ed Johnson seems to lack the special
quality that makes someone fit the Rhodes mold. The
Phi regrets the article did not come off as a piece of
‘fluff’ praising Washington and Lee. Yet I’m even
more sorry that Mr.Johnson has not found the liberal
arts education at W&L—I can’t think of a better place
to learn. I believe our school is one of the few bastions
of “liberal education”’ existing today and anyone who
has learned anything in four years here should have
the education to realize it.

Oppose
Change

vear Editor:

Our state legislature is once
again ready to pass a law which
will greatly affect our rights
and social activities. The
General Laws committee of the
House of Delegates in Rich-
mond will soon decide if a bill to
change the drinking age from 18
to 19 will be reported to the floor
of the House of Delegates.

This legislation is being in-
troduced because of high school

' students’ drinking activities in

northern Virginia. It appears
that 18-year-old Seniors are
buying beer and distributing it
to their younger contem-
poraries in and about the high
school grounds. Because of this
the high school authorities have
pressured certain special in-
terest groups into backing the
proposed law change.

This bill will be defeated only
if you make your voice heard by
contacting ‘your represen-
tatives, passing petitions, and
or sending a delegation from
your school to Richmond and
appear before the General
Laws committee.

We hope you will join in our
effort to stop this unjust pro-
posal.

Senior Questions EC

Role In Honor Hearings

‘lo the Executive Committee:

I am not writing this letter in response to any specific recent
event, but simply to share some thoughts regarding the administra-
tion of our honor system by you gentlemen. Recent discussions with
a former member of your committee and a rather unpleasant past
experience with the workings of the honor hearings have led me to
have some fear of the fact that inan honor hearing members of the
executive committee must serve not only as judges, but as jury,
and most importantly, prosecutor as well. Ideally, an honor hear-
ing is conducted to bring out the facts regarding any accusation of
an honor violation. Yet. in bringing out these facts in your question-
ing it is at times unavoidable that you must slip into the role of pro-
secutor. That is, you must assume guilt on the part of the accused.
It would seem to me that the only way you can evaluate the truth of
some testimony is to consider the possible falsity of that testimony
and thus guilt on the part of the accused.

My question to you then is simple. With this past term behind you,
have you in any of your deliberations come to believe the accused to
be guilty because you became wrapped up in your role as pro-
secutor? Have you at any time thought to youself, ‘I’ve got you
now.” or heard one of your fellows say: ‘‘We're going to nail this
guy.’’ (It has happened)? This is no doubt difficult to avoid at
times and I ask this question more to point out that it can occur
rather than to condemn its possible occurrence.

You gentlemen are entrusted with a considerable responsibility,
you are elected, yet your deliberations are secret and you can give
but one punishment. I hope this letter might in some way help you
with that responsibility.

Board of Direcotrs and Staff of
Alcohol Services of Rockbridge,
Inc., are using the month of
January, 1981, to heighten com-
munity awareness of the nature
of the illness and the available
local resources for prevention
and treatment. On Wednesday,
January 28, 1981, at 7:30 p.m.,
we will sponsor a workshop in

a panel of persons willing to
share how they have been af-
fected by the disease and
knowledgeable in the field of ad-
diction. Areas such as problem
drinking, detection of
alcoholism, and crisis interven-
tion will be explored, and ques-

We invite you to be part of this
learning experience. There is
no charge. The only cost to you
is your time, and the benefits
will be immediate.

Ubermann

Dear Editors:

I have only known him as
Maxwell The Pseudo-Overman.
Now I know his identity, his
name is Ed Johnson. Maxwell
has been playing around with
his billig rd ball models for far
too long. An education is not
somethi: g that one finds, but is
somethi:.z that one acquires
through ‘vork. The purpose of
Washing on and Lee is to help
the student acquire that educa-
tion, and that is why we are
known as a “teaching college,”
as opposed to a “research col-
lege.”

I must admit, however, that
Maxwell will make a good Zim-
babwe scholar. He seems to
possess a Steel-trap logical
mind, and is apparently free
from all sexual and emotional
hang-ups, but then again, these
are the attributes of any Uber-
mann right Maxwell?

Johnson
Responds

Dear Editor:

I am saddened by last week’s
Phi article and its air of rancor
about W&L. At the time, I was
not sure of the relevance of my
opinions on social and academic
life here — but I tried to answer
the reporter’s questions honest-
ly. Unfortunately, many of my
ideas were paraphrased and
many of these approximations
were sanctioned by quotation
marks. This created an impres-
sion of bitterness I certainly do
not feel.

To be sure, | feel very real
concerns about these aspects of
the University. However, I did
choose to stay here for four
years and my concerns should
be viewed in this context. Also,
my disillusion stems from com-
paring W&L with an imaginary
ideal school; one which may not
exist in this less than perfect
world. My suggestions were
meant constructively, to help us
achieve this ideal. Finally, the
Physics Department and other
faculty members’ have
dedicated ‘ an emormous
amount of time to special pro-
jects of great value to my in-
tellectual development. I am
deeply grateful for their efforts.

Our Rhodes Scholar:
Laughs And Goose Calls

Dear Editor:

Upon sitting down to dinner last Thursday night, I
overheard laughs and goose calls from my frater-
nity brothers. Looking over, I saw that they were
reading the Ring-tum Phi and that the noise was a
result of the article written about our new Rhodes
Scholar, Ed Johnson, who sits in his research
room in the bottom floor of Parmly Hall. Upon
reading the story myself, I was ashamed of my
brothers’ cruelty. I realized that it was due to their
ignorance of Cecil John Rhodes’ intentions for the
scholarship’s use. I will now enlighten them to
what Rhodes wanted, and I believe that once they
understand what makes a Rhodes Scholar, they
will certainly see that Mr. Johnson is a worthy
recipient.

In Rhodes’ will (found in the Encyclopedia
Britannica, Vol. 19), he gave his intentions in this
way: “my desire being that students who shall be
elected to the scholarships shall not be merely
bookworms, I direct that in the election of a stu-
dent to a scholarship, regard shall be had for (1)
his literary and scholastic attainments; (2) his
fondness for and success in manly outdoor sports.

(3) his qualities of manhood, truth, courage,
devotion to duty, sympathy for and protection of
the weak, kindliness, unselfishness and
fellowship; and (4) his exhibition during school
days of moral force of character, and of instincts
to lead and to take an interest in his schoolmates,
for those latter attributes will be likely in after life
to guide him to esteem the performance of public
duties as his highest aim.”’

I shall now try to show, using quotes from the
original article, that Mr. Johnson most adequately
fulfills these requirements.

Mr. Johnson shows literary attainment: “I was
taken in by the liberal arts bulls--t.’’“‘I’m not sure
if I am a confident student or if I am even
literate.’’ Showing both literary attainment and
his qualities of manhood, he says, ‘‘(W&L) is the
best school I know to get laid.’’(Can you picture it?
Washington Hall getting laid? ). ‘‘By the end of the
week everyone is horny.’ His qualities of
manhood are also shown in the statement, ‘“W&L
has caused him to have difficulty in working with
women.”

His success in manly outdoor sports is summed
up by this inspired quote: ‘‘I tried to go through
rush open minded.”

Interest in schoolmates: ‘‘The average friend in
a fraternity is artificial; he has no idea what you
have done or what you’re doing.”’

Courage: ‘‘It’s hard for me to talk professional-
ly toa woman unless I’ve danced with her first.”

Unselfishness: ‘‘W&L should increase tuition so
that more research equipment can be purchased.”

Instincts to lead and take interest in
schoolmates: “‘There are so few people here you
can talk to about physics.”’

And last, but not the least, devotion to duty:
“Johnson said he definitely would not return to
W&L.”’

I think Mr. Johnson has every right to move to
Great Britain.

Sincere

Condolences

Over
Constraint

Dear Editor:

I would simply like to offer
my sincere condolences to Ed
Johnson for being constrained
here at Washington and Lee for
four years. Furthermore, I feel
that I, as well as any fraternity
member on campus who has
been similarly deluded about
their friends, owe Mr. Johnson
a great vote of thanks for poin-
ting out the shallowness of our
lives. Finally, I believe that the
evaluation he offers of his un-
fortunate lack of a liberal arts
education is very appropriate.
A true appreciation. of the
knowledge offered by the
liberal arts should enable an in-
dividual to better understand
himself and others without un-
substantiated bias or cynicism.
I agree that Mr. Johnson has
not gained that appreciation
here at W&L, and I certainly
wish him better luck at Cam-
bridge.

Sincerely,
Edmund Perry, ’82

The President On Liberal Education

On Saturday, November 4, 1978 W&L President Robert E.R.
Huntley delivered a series of remarks to several hundred parents
and students entitled In Defense of Liberal Arts Education.

The word “‘liberal”’ is used in so many contexts with so many dif-
fering connotations that we may forget that its primary meaning
has to do with freedom: liberty and liberation. A liberal education
is an education designed to liberate the mind, to free it from ig-
norance and from the animal emotions and instincts which may
constrict and dominate it, and to free it from the aimless and
useless thrashings-about to which the untutored intellect is prone.

A liberal education is intenaed to cause the mind to become as
useful as it is capable of being. In this sense, the purpose of a liberal

education is the most utilitarian of all.

Let me mention a few of my ideas about the way in which a
liberal arts college like Washington and Lee attempts — or should

 

attempt — to provide its students the foundation of a liberal educa-
tion, to help its students develop useful minds.

The curriculum should include courses in all or nearly all the sub-
jects which time has proven to be fit for disciplined and orderly in-
quiry and which reveal and explore important segments of
mankind’s accumulated experience. It’s easy to discern certain
subjects which must be included —history and literature, for exam-
ple. Others come quickly to mind; the natural sciences, philosophy,
religion, economics, for example.

All these subjects, and some others, readily meet the two basic
criteria. I suggested earlier. Each is a fit subject for orderly and
disciplined inquiry. Each encompasses a massive accumulation of

thought and knowledge and wisdom of mankind over an extended

Huntley’s Comments On W&L Education

tion by the best minds of
the past. Thus, each can be

taught and learned in a
manageable way.
The courses, properly

selected and properly taught,
must be imbedded in a cur-
ricular structure which is well
ordered and purposeful. A ran-
dom array will not do. The
undergraduate student must be
guided into this cirriculum in a
way which will cause him to
achieve two immediate objec-
tives. First, he must have a
significant learning experience
in each of the several kinds of
Subjects which make ‘up a
liberal arts curriculum
—humanities, natural sciences,
languages, social sciences.

Furthermore, the student is
required to achieve approx-
imate mastery of at least one
liberal arts subject. He may
become a major in economics,
or physics, or English, for ex-
ample.

Note that this process, the
liberal arts process, is not the
Same as what is sometimes call-
ed ‘‘general education.’’
‘General education,’ if I
understand that term, seeks to
tell the student a little bit about
a lot of things — to produce a
well-informed and presumably
well-adjusted human being. A
liberal arts education
postulates that the student
should have the real experience
of learning and thinking in each
of several arenas of knowledge
where the greatest minds of the
past have plowed fertile ground
— and that in one of them, he
should become, as nearly as he
can, an expert. Its purpose is
not to produce well-informed
graduates, though it may in-
cidentally do that. Its purpose is
to produce’ well-educated
graduates, who can quickly
become well informed in almost
any field, and who can apply a
tough and discriminating in-
tellect to the information they
obtain.

The ideal of the liberal arts
tradition is not easily attained,
even by those institutions such
as Washington and Lee which
strive purposefully to attain it.

Education has been confused
with training. A bird dog needs
training, and if he is to be a good
bird dog, he must have training.
A human being needs educa-
tion, and if he is to be a good
human being, he must have
education. Human beings may
also be trained — whether or
not they are educated. But for
an important task, any in-
telligent employer except a
despot will always choose an
untrained well-educated person
over an uneducated well-
trained one. For human beings,
training is important;
education is vital.

It is also possible that many
of our large public institutions
— not all, but many — have long
since lost the battle to preserve
a liberal educational ideal. If
this is true, then the last line of
defense is the independent
liberal arts college, which is not
in a strong position to exert ef-
fective pressure on our educa-
tional system.

The public education system
faces its own problems. In re-
cent years we have all heard
much about the diminishing
college-age population. Most
private institutions — certainly
Washington and Lee — have

long since learned to live, and
indeed desire to live, with stu-
dent populations of stable size.

Most public institutions have
become accustomed to living on
what I would call ‘‘the margin
of growth’’ in the years since
World War II; in those years,
there have been rapid annual
increases in_- student
enrollments at nearly all public
institutions. At most such in-
stitutions, increased operating
income is a direct and im-
mediate result of increased stu-
dent body size, but the addi-
tional costs of enlarged size

tend to lag by several years.

Therefore, even if there are
no permanent unit economies of
scale to be derived from
largness, there will be an ap-
parent financial health provid-

ed by the margin of growth. As
that growth diminishes or levels
off to zero, the pressure on the
public institution to find
students will become increas-
ingly insistent.

Also as the numbers diminish
and at the same time,
legislators and _ legislatures
become more and more restric-
tive about their willingness to
keep open the faucet of
unlimited public funds, public
institutions all over the country
are turning to private philan-
throphy. I don’t blame them for
that, I simply cite it as a fact.

I would point out one or two
salient economic points about
that observation. For the public
institution, private philan-
thropy is the icing on the cake.
For us, it is the cake.

There are other threats of this
practical variety. There is
however, one _ philosophical
threat that is perhaps of greater
concern. :

I believe there is a growing
doubt among educators and
among the populace of America
about the value of the kind -of
education I’ve ‘ attempted to
describe. I am no longer as cer-
tain as I would have been twen-
ty years ago, no longer as cer-
tain as I would like to be, that
most persons in America agree
with my emphasis on the impor-
tance of liberal education.

I suspect that this grows from
several factors. The increasing
demand for practicality, for im-
mediate applicability of
everything learned, is one.
Another, more disturbing, is the
increasing distrust of reason
and rationality. You can see it
all around you — the turn to the
occult, to the metaphysical; the
eschewing of reason as the
primary basis for human ex-

istence.

To these kinds of criticisms,
education should respond
positively and with conviction.
It is my impression that it has
not yet done so.

At Washington and Lee, I
believe I can speak for the
faculty, the students, and Board
of Trustees in assuring you that
it is our determined intention to
retain our educational ideal. We

Midterms

Christmas dance held last term.
Elam said that of 300 tickets
available, only 122 were sold.

The E.C. also heard midterm
reports from other organiza-
tions, including the Ring-tum
Phi, the Calyx, the Student Bar
Association, the Ariel and the
Mock Convention.

Ring-tum Phi editor John
Billmyre was questioned by
Senior representative Marshall
Clark about the paper’s lack of
quality. The E.C. also decided
to inquire into the possibility of
the Phi using journalism equip-
ment, including a computer
system, in Reid Hall.

Speaking for the Calyx,
Editor Peter Eliades noted that
the yearbook is still having pro-
blems getting senior pictures
completed. Eliades said that
pictures will cost an extra $2
because of price increases
made by his photographer.

will survive as at least one in-
stitution that believes in the
liberal education, in the value of
the human mind and in the
aspirations of the human spirit.
With continued assistance, this
school, two hundred years from
now, will still represent the
traditions and the strengths
which it has represented for the
two hundred years that have
gone before.

 

Ariel Editor Channing Hall
announced that 200 copies of the
Ariel’s fall issue remain from a
total of 1200 printed.. Hall said
that he has $1200 to budget for a
spring issue.

Student Bar Association
Treasurer Hop Xing fielded
questions concerning the ex-
istence of an SAB outing club
and its events overlapping with
the W&L outing club. Xing said
the two club’s schedules conflict
too much for an agreement to
be worked out.

Junior Representative Eric
Myers noted that the Generals
of Jazz music ensemble is a
good example of an organiza-
tion consisting of both
undergraduate and law school
students. Xing noted that the
Generals of Jazz was founded
by law students, however.

The E.C. later agreed that a
combination of the two groups
would be a good way to improve
the program.
