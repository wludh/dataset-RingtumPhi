Interview:

Final Details Set For
Weekend-Long Superdance

by Steven Perry
As Superdance ’81 ap-
proaches, the long hours of
planning and preparation are
starting to pay off with over one
thousand registration packets
in distribution, and both J.
Hemby and Tripp Brower ex-
pect an increase in participa-

tion over previous years.
During the dance-a-thon, four
grand prizes will be awarded.
These special prizes fall into

two categories. The dancer with
the most money pledged
receives a trip for two to Key
West Florida. The runner-up
will be awarded a trip for two to
Greenbriar Resort. The re-
maining prizes will be awarded
for the two largest cash dona-
tions received during Super-
dance ’81. Brower stated that in
addition to the four grand
prizes, the dancers will be eligi-
ble for one of the door prizes

Houses Question
Noise Ordinance

by John Ran Smith

You’re at a Wednesday night
party at one of the fraternity
houses. It is late, well after mid-
night. There are a few people
still sucking down brews and
some good tunes are playing,
seemingly not too loud. Sudden-
ly an officer of the Lexington
Police Department pops into
the room and cites the president
or social chairman with a viola-
tion of the Lexington Noise Or-
dinance and also for failing to
obtain a ‘‘noise permit.”’

End of party.

This has been the scene in
many of W&L’s fraternities
over the last three years.

Finally, some of the fraternity

leaders have been so frustrated
by the ambiguity of the or-
dinance that they have begun to
take action.

Three houses charged last fall
with violations of the ordinance
challenged the charges in court
in December and were found
not guilty of violating the noise
ordinance. The houses were
found guilty of failing to obtain
a permit, however, which a
fraternity is unable to get for a
Wednesday night.

Phi Delta Theta, Kappa
Alpha and Sigma Chi were all
represented by local attorney
Eric Sisler in the case, and each
decided to appeal their convic-

Willis And The Honor System

 

EC President Bob Willis has long been a spokesman for the honor
system at Washington and Lee. In an interview with Ring-tum Phi News
Editor Bill Whalen, Willis explains some of his views on the honor
system and assesses the future role the EC must play in guaranteeing
that the honor system remains a credible doctrine.

Phi: First, Bob, give us your view of the honor system, not the
White Book’s.

Willis: The honor system at Washington and Lee, in my opinion,
is a system that students have established to govern themselves
and to ensure that a spirit of trust is the rule of life here at Washing-
ton and Lee. It pervades all aspects of life. The emphasis is on
students, and the definition of honor, in my opinion, has to come
from students and has to be defined by students of each student
generation. It is asystem by which students themselves govern and
set rules for themselves and interpret those rules as they perceive
trustworthy and honorable conduct.

Phi: In your own opinion, do you think W&L’s honor system
works?

Willis: Yes, I do. | think each year there are more and more
pressures from the outside world to circumvent the system, but I
think the system continues to work at Washington and Lee because
of the students’ complete control of the system. It works because
the administration remains out of it and the students put faith in it

and are more inclined to turn someone in to enforce it, to abide by
the decisions of the (Executive) Committee.

Phi: You mentioned some ‘‘outside pressures,’’ could you
elaborate on those?

Willis: There’s always the pressure, first of all, that as W&L
becomes more cosmopolitan, as we attract more people from a
wider ranger of socio-economic backgrounds, as we look toward a
greater diversity of students, then the EC and the student body
have a greater challenge of indoctrinating and orienting, if that’s a
better word, incoming students to the honor system because
“‘honorable”’ and ‘‘gentlemanly conduct”’ are terms that are more
foreign to some of the students coming in. What might be accep-
table in the Bronx may not be acceptable in Tracey City, Ten-
nessee. In that sense, there has to be a greater effort by the com-
mittee to field the different currents that are coming in to the stu-
dent body and to respond to those. Also, there is a general tendency
in society today, in my opinion, to do whatever you can so long as
you don’t get caught. I think more and more people have that im-
pression. For the honor system to work, it’s imperative that the Ex-
ecutive Committee orient people and tell them that we are not go-
ing to tolerate that at Washington and Lee — that honest is an
honest intention. That is, to perceive the facts as they are and not as

(See WILLIS, page 10)

given away every hour.

Interspersed with the twenty-
eight hours of dancing are
several pie throws. Dean Mur-
phy, who was last year’s most
popular target, remains the
favorite to raise the most
money this year. However,
students will also have the op-
portunity to peg Dr. Worth,
Dean Atwood, Mr. Leach and
Prof. Smith. When asked why
he would submit to having a pie
tossed in his face, Dean Murphy
stated that “It’s an excellent
way for the students to get in-
volved in the community.” He
went on to say that he hopes the
fraternities on campus will be
willing to pay a lot of money to
nail him.

Although the first registration
deadline for the Dance-a-thon
was yesterday, it is not too late
to sign up. The final deadline for
registration is 7 p.m. Friday.
When asked whether the $50
minimum for dancers would
decrease participation, Hemby
explained that the pledges could
be obtained over the phone, so
the contestants should have lit-
tle trouble finding sponsors.

In a related marathon, Chris
Daniels ran 48.1 miles — from
Hollins College to Zollman’s
Pavilion — to benefit Muscular
Dystrophy. By covering this
distance in seven hours and 55
minutes, Daniels netted over
$1,550 for the M.D. cause.
Daniels, running at an average
of 10 miles per hour was pleased
with his performance. This sen-
timent was later echoed by
Vince Coviello, who trailed
Daniels by car throughout the
marathon. Coviello stated that
Daniels was in good spirits
throughout the race despite two
muscle pulls.

Prometheus

The F.D. Bid

My finger trembled as I inserted it in the telephone dial. Did I dial

the right number? What will I say? Will she remember me? Sweat
trickled off the cold, hard receiver. Then...the rings, the rings, six
long, tortuous rings. Then...

“Hello, hello...”’

I was stunned. Speechless. Gaping.

“Er, ah, yes, this is, ah, Patrick Elior McAlister, III. Is, ah,
Elizabeth Christian Morgan at home?”

“Wait a minute; I'll get her for you...Lizzy, Lizzy.” Giggles. Gig-
gles. Giggles. All I could hear were giggles.

“Hello. This is Elizabeth Christian Morgan.”’

“Oh, ah, hi Lizzy; I mean Elizabeth; ah, do you remember me? I
mean, ah, this is Patrick Elior McAllister, III, and ah, I met you
last week at the mixer at the fraternity house, and you knew my
sister from high school in Fort Worth, and we talked about Dallas
and I was wondering if you like pizza, no I mean, I was wondering if
you wanted to go to Fancy Dress weekend with me up here at
Washington and Lee III, I mean at W&L.

“Ah, Patrick, ah, well, I don’t know, Patrick, when is it?

“The last weekend in February.’’

“Oh, Pat, I’m so sorry; I can’t make it. My grandmother died.”’
Click. That was freshman year.

My finger trembled as I inserted it in the telephone dial, I was so
drunk I could hardly see and I pretty well knew I wasn’t dialing the
right number. Cool confidence oozed through the receiver. I just
hope she can’t smell the liquor on my breath, I thought to myself.

‘Hello, this is Pat III. Is Tricia St. Clair around?”’
Ah, no you have the wrong number.”
~ “Oh, really who’s this?”
‘*(Sexily ) Sassy Crabtree.”

“Oh, really, great, great. Say what are you doing the last
weekend in February? Do you want to come up for a big party anda
wild time? If it gets boring, we can always go up to the Parkway
and drink some wine.”

“Sounds great, but where will I stay?” Click. That was
sophomore year.

My finger trembled as I inserted it in the telephone dial. I
wondered how a nice boy like me (Patrick Eliot McAlister, III)
could get into a situation like this.

““Hello...mom, mom...ah, could I speak to dad?”’

“‘What’s up, Pat III? Do you need some more money?”’

‘Well, ah no, dad, well, you see, you know, well, I’m down here at
the Second Precinct in Roanoke, and ah, well...me and the guys kin-
da got set up with these whores, nor really whores, more like
hookers, and ah, we got busted.”’

“That’s ok, Pat III. I remember how things were when I was at
Washington and Lee. You were probably just trying to get a Fancy
Dress date.”’

Click. That was junior year.

My hand trembled as I picked up the receiver. Two o’clock in the
morning and the phone wouldn’t stop ringing. Dumb broads won’t
let a stoned man sleep.

‘Hello...Pat III, here.”

“Hi, Patrick?” This is Mary-June Sterling. You remember me,
don’t you? We met last week at the Hollins mixer and you were
talking about some great party called Fancy Dress, or something
like that, and you told me ( sexily) that I had the most beautiful eyes
and an arousing southern accent, and then...

“Oh, Patrick, you told me you loved me and we...’’
Click. That was senior year.

Students Stay Away From EC Gripe Session

by Cope Moyers

If mere numbers are any in-
dication of how students view
life at Washington and Lee
University, then Tuesday
night’s special Executive Com-
mittee meeting proved that
almost everybody is content.

Despite a two-week advertis-
ing campaign which featured
numerous notices posted
_ around campus and in the Phi
reminding students and faculty
of the special meeting, not one
person came before the com-
mittee to ‘‘gripe.”’

‘Maybe we could stir-up
some interest if we lined the EC
up on the colonnade,” said
Senior Representative Marshall
Clark, who originally suggested
that the committee hold a
special session so people could
voice their complaints directly
to the EC.

Clark said that he was
bothered by the lack of student
interest but added that he hopes
the special meetings will con-
tinue.

“Eventually, maybe in a year
or two, people will once again
become interested in_ this
university,’’ Clark said. ‘‘I still
think it’s necessay to have them
(the meetings) in the future.”

Committee member Mike
Nogay did tell the committee of
a complaint brought to his at-
tention earlier in the week by a
law student. Nogay said the stu-
dent asked him if it would be
possible to post the hours
Warner Center would be
available for intramural
basketball games since the law
school has an extensive in-
tramural program involving 12
teams.

Sophomore member Pete
Baumgaertner reported that a
student had complained to him
about the price the Student Ac-
tivities Board charged for
tickets to Winter Weekend. Ac-
cording to Baumgaertner, the
student had asked him why the
student tax money acquired
from each student in September
is not applied to SAB activities
such as Winter Weekend.

President Bob Willis told
Baumgaertner the committee
will examine this complaint fur-
ther when the SAB makes its
monthly report next week.

Baumgaertner also proposed
that an Executive Committee
suggestion box be placed in the
Supply Store/Co-op so students
can make complaints or sugges-
tions without having to appear
directly before the committee.
His proposal was approved and
the box should be available for
students in the coming weeks.

Shortly before the meeting
adjourned, freshman represen-
tative Ben Hale suggested the
EC make a strong effort to re-
mind students that all Monday
night meetings are open for
students to appear before the
committee. Hale suggested that
the time and place of all com-

_ mittee. .meetings. be posted

along with the minutes.
Secretary Bud White said he
would see that all the pertinent
information was included each
week.

On Monday night, the Ex-
ecutive Committee held its
regularly scheduled meeting
and agreed to select students
and administrators next week
that might serve on the White
Book Revisions Committee.

Two administrators and three
students will be selected by the
full committee to help revise
the White Book. Three

members of the Executive
Committee, Eric Myers, Ben
Hale and Jim Vines, will also
serve on the subcommittee.
Vines replaces Bob Willis, who
said that time constraints make
it impossible for him to remain
of the subcommittee.

In other business, Willis
reported that a subcommittee
investigation into the possible
use of VDT equipment in Reid
Hall by the Phi is continuing but
that a recent discussion with
journalism professor Hampden
H. Smith III had revealed that it

would be impractical for the
newspaper to use the equip-
ment.

Willis said Smith had told him 1

that because the VDT equip- -
ment was ‘‘unreliable’’ and ex-
tensive time would be required
to operate the machines, it
would not be possible for the Phi
to use the equipment.

Bud White read a letter to the
committee from Dean Watt
regarding the EC’s earlier sug-
gestion that the university add
course titles to student report

is coming through.

cards. According to White, Watt
approved of the idea only if
there is enough space on the
present cards for the additional
information.

Unless room can be found
nothing can be done until the
present supply of cards js &*
hausted. White said the univer-
sity still has about 10,000 of the
old cards.

The EC will meet again at
6:30 p.m. on Monday, in the EC
room of the student center.

Review

_ Ariel Warfare

by M. Shaw Pyle

The last Ariel — the one that
raised eyebrows (and gorges)
on the Executive Committee
—is hard to deal with. One gets
the impression that the editors
and staff would have liked it
that way; which worries me.

The plupart of pieces are,
well, pointedly pointless; they
are terribly fashionable, for-
mulaic exercises in — who
knows what? Look, the type of
piece we’re talking about is all
too common: a narrative, often
in stream-of-consciousness
form, detailing an experience
almost on the fringe of reality in
its severance from life as most
of us live it. However mundane
this incident, the author
abstracts it as far as possible
from the context which could
alone give it sense, imbues it
with mystic overtones, inflates
it to mythic proportions, and re-
counts it as if it were a new
canonical Gospel. There is a dif-
ference between vignettes, like
Palmore Clarke’s award win-
ner, “Pavement,” and Steve
McCabe’s equally honored
“The Angelus,’’ and mere ex-
amples of deliberate obfusca-
tion: N. J. Brady’s “A Lost Part
of Their Journey,” the painfully
mannered attempts at mental
gymnastics of John Dyer Fort
(“While Society Sleeps’’), and
AOAOA’s untitled letter beginn-

ing ‘Dear Citizens of the Peo-

_ple’s Republic of the United

States...’’:: (the word
“sophomoric”’ is the kindest cut
I can deal that waste of paper
and ink).
Perhaps it is my Southern
heritage peeking out, but the
Jack Sharman ‘‘Alabama
Glands and Strawberries”
seems to me to deserve not only
the ’80 Mahan Poetry Award it
garnered, but careful attention
by everyone who can read. If
this doesn’t convince you, dear
reader, of the rot at the core of
our society — a rot compounded
of uxury, luxury, and a lack of
any philosophic values at all, at
all — why then, you are just too
far gone yourself: tunes like
‘the falcon sure as hell don’t
listen to the falconer in this
county...”” and ‘‘...days of our
strange, prophetless youth’”’
ought to be carved in stone
—and may yet, on the grave
marker of our generation. (Of
course, suicides aren’t
supposed to get Christian
burial...).
“The Heartland,” a poem by

J. Jacob Jones, also evokes a
real feel for a_ certain
philosophical paradigm I love:
it is sometime called ‘“‘the
American character.” Jones’
piece smells of the high plains,
and the foothills of the Rockies;
of wheat and turf and honest

 

toil.

As for the rest of the issue,
well, it’s unkind to speak too
harshly of the dead. The rot we
just discussed is deep — in fact,
it’s getting deeper. (Time for
those hip-waders, reader). Par-
ticularly reprehensible ex-
amples of the prevailing fad in
circumlocution are Jas. K.
Leva’s new ‘‘Izaak’’ and most
of the ((for want of a better,
printable word) ‘‘poems’’:
works like ‘‘Puddle Grave’ and
“On Wanting a Cookie...’’ If this
sort of verbal exhibitionism is
how English majors get their
cookies, it’s time for the legions
of literate lectors to panic.
These labored attempts to be
“cerebral” and ‘‘arty’’ — some
of which, God help us, won
Mahan awards — smell of New
Jersey and small Midwestern
literary socieities; of provincial
college in the ’20s and the
Chablis and Brie snoblets of the
world.

It is time for the chaps at
Ariel — and in the English
Department — to start thinking
for themselves. Failing that,
they can at least have the
courtesy to ape C. S. Lewis, J.
R. R. Tolkien, H. L. Mencken,
and other critics of the word
they have profaned.

No wonder the picture’s fuz-
zy: the Ariel’s on the blink.

‘Claire’s Knee’ to be Shown

by Carren O. Kaston

The Washington and Lee Film
Society presents next Eric
Rohmer’s philosophical com-
edy Claire’s Knee (France,
1970). It will be screened on Fri-
day, February 6, and Saturday,
February 7, at 8 p.m. in
classroom ‘‘A”’ of Lewis Hall,
free of charge. In support of the
muscular dystrophy dance
marathon being held on campus
this weekend, the Film Society
will make a donation amounting
to half the money collected at
the showings ofClaire’s Knee.

Claire’s Knee is one of
Rohmer’s last “moral tales,’’ a
series of six movies which ex-
plore modern ideas about
morality and sexual freedom,
and their relation to fantasy.
Other well known movies in the
series include My Night at
Maud’s(1969) and Chloe in the
Afternoon (1972). In explana-
tion of his genre, Rohmer has

said that ‘‘What I call a conte
.moral is not a tale with a moral,
but a story which deals less with
what people do than with what
is going on in their minds while
they are doing it.’’ Rohmer is a
former critic for Cahiers du
Cinema, the French film journal
associated with the rise of the
New Wave.

The moral tale in Claire’s
Knee grows out of a witty con-
ceit. Jerome, an engaged man
on summer vacation in the lake
country, becomes obsessed with
the knee of a young fellow
guest, Claire. His only desire is
to touch her knee without her
realizing that he has spent
weeks planning this, for him,
momentous event. Jerome
finally returns to his fiancee
with his reputation ostensibly
unsullied; Aurora, a woman
novelist friend, watches from
the sidelines, drawing material
for her stalled plot.

This conflation of comedy of
manners and rationalizing
philosophy produces a movie
that, to use a term from music,
is a fascinating, whimsical
caprice. In supremely civilized
dialogue, Jerome takes flight
from freedom and passion into
the clarity and security of self-
justifying intellectuality. On the
most disturbing level, his
intellectual obsession with
touching Claire’s knee is
perhaps even more ethically
provocative than outright
seduction because it lacks both
emotional involvement on his
part and consent on hers.

The Film Society has chosen
the following films for presenta-
tion this winter and spring:
Werner Herzog’s Aguirre, the
Wrath of God (Germany, 1973),
Luis Bunnuel’s That Obscure
Object of Desire (Spain, 1972,)
and Georgi Shengelaya’s
Pirosmani (Russia, 1971).

Campus Drama:

A Look Ahead

by M. Shaw Pyle

We woke up one morning and
nothing was were we'd left it.
Guest director Richard
Mogavero was gone — for per-
sonal reasons. The major pro-
duction for the winter term was
no longer Hot L Baltimore, but
Look Homeward Angel. And a
minister’s wife who just hap-
pened to move to Buena Vista
also just happened to be a
creditable MFA from the great

.| midwest, and is now teaching

W&L’s acting and directing
courses. (We see the Hand of
God in this one, folks.) Welcome
to W&L, Mrs. Langdon.

But despite the musical
chairs motif, our beloved
troubadors just keep troubbing
along. The snow is in the air;
can senior theses be far behind?
(Hint: the answers starts with
‘n”’ and means ‘“‘no’’...)
February 10, 11, and 12 will see
the Boiler Room Theatre aban-
doned to the coquettish wiles
and wanton cheer of the great
gloom monger Harold Pinter.
Homer Bliss will be sweating
nervously as he stakes his ma-
jor on The Dumb Waiter; he’ll
direct twice each evening, with
two different casts and inter-
pretations. Then Tom Zeigler
has an original play (you do
remember last winter’s hit,

Weeds, don’t you? The critics
do.) Tom’s latest, The Ninth
Step, is a psychological drama
about a woman who conquers
the symptoms but not the
causes of her alcoholism. |
Ginger McNeese and Pam
Simpson will star, March 4-7 at
8 p.m. While reservations are
not required, do hit the)
Troubador early — you know
what a shoe box the place is.

With Mogavero's departure,
Hot L. Baltimore has been
Shelved in favor of the stu-
dent/cast suggestion, Look
Homeward Angel. Angel, as
any Tarheel knows, is the
Pulitzer winning adaptation of
Thomas Wolfe’s novel. The
adaptation won the New York
Critics’ award for 1958 and is
quite an effective treatment of
Wolfe’s autobiographical yarn.
Doctor Gordon will preside over
this shot March 20-22 and 25-28
in the Troubador. Angel fears to
tread the boards without reser-
vations, so you'll have to ring up
the ‘Varsity’, 463-9111, ext. 371.

After these come April
showers: Mrs. Langdon’s ad-
vanced directing classes are
having One Act Evenings April
2 and 3 in the Boiler Room,
followed by discussions.

Hang on to your hats, folks.
It’s going to be quite a year.

ODAC Basketball
Tourney Is Just
Around The Bend

by Ralph Frasca

As such phenomena have a
tendency to do, the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference Basket-
ball Championship Tournament
is only three weeks away.
Slated for February 26-28, the
event sports a few new wrinkles
this year.

Two more rivals from the
ODAC have been added to the
fray, namely Maryville and
nemesis Roanoke, which boosts
the number of competing teams
to eight. When the ODAC held
the first tourney, way back in
February of 1977, only four
schools vied for the crown, as
was the case with the 1978 tour-
nament. The 1979 and 1980
championships were expanded
to include all six ODAC teams.

In addition to the expanded
field, this year’s event is the
first in which a neutral site will
be employed. The Salem/
Roanoke Valley Civic Center in
Salem, Va. is neutral enough, I
suppose, although it is in much
closer proximity to Roanoke
than any other school, ensuring
the presence of vast amounts of
Maroons’ fans.

The 1977 championship took
place at W&L; 1978 at Lynch-
burg; in 1979 the site was
Bridgewater; and last year’s
host was Hampden-Sydney.

The first-round action will
take place on Thursday,
February 26. The semi-finals

are on tap the following day,
and the title game commences
on Saturday. With the addition
of the awesome Roanoke club,
16-1 at this writing, W&L is
predicted to relinquish the tour-
nament crown they won last
year. However, the Generals
overcame staggering odds to
thrash Roanoke on January 20,
and one wonders if Verne Can-
field can prime his players for
another spoiler role. The
Generals also capped the 1977
and 1978 ODAC tournaments,
while the Lynchburg Hornets
took the 1979 crown.

The ODAC pairings are deter-
mined by the customary
“outside-in” method. The team
which finishes first at the con-
clusion of the regular season
plays the cellar-dweller, the
second-place team squares off
against the seventh-place team,
three against six, and four ver-
sus five. Roanoke will probably
face Emory & Henry, but the
other pairings are anybody’s
guess. Just a hunch, but I’ll bet
the Generals meet Bridgewater
in first-round competition.

The ODAC champion ad-
vances to the four-team NCAA
Division III South Atlantic
Regional Tournament, which is
the first leg of the journey
towards winning the National
Division III title.

I’ll return with the promised
Boyd Williams interview next
week,

Basketball Alumni
Play Saturday

18 former Washington and
Lee University basketball
players will visit their alma
mater on Saturday, February 7
to compete in the first annual
W&L Alumni Basketball Game.
The event will begin at 7:00
p.m. in W&L’s Warner Center
and serve as a lead-in to the
Washington and Lee vs. Lynch-
burg College game, set for an
8:30 p.m. tip-off.

“These alumni have done a
super job in organizing this af-
fair,”’ reports W&L head coach
Verne Canfield, who has coach-
ed all the participating alumni
during his 17 seasons with the
University. ‘‘Their efforts show
the committment they have to
the basketball program and to
the University. I look forward to

a fun evening with them.”’

Included among the alumni,
who will divide into two teams
and play a regulation game,
are: Tommy Cox (class of
1967); Norwood Morrison and
Stuart Fauber (’70); John
Glace (’72); Doug Clelan (’73);
Randy Raylor and Greg
Croghan (’75); John Podgajny
and Paul Maloney (’76); Kim
Sims, Bob Flint, and Don Berin
(77); Mike Wenke and Dave
Leunig (’79). Canfield’s first
season at W&L was 1964-65.

Preceeding the Alumni game
will be a W&L junior varsity
contest with Fork Union
Military Academy, set to begin
at 5:15. The W&L-Lynchburg
varsity contest is the Generals’
next-to-last home game of the
1980-81 season.

Generals Bounce Maryville
As Graves Becomes Starter

by Dale Park

‘My philosophy and pro-
cedure,”’ explained Washington
and Lee head basketball coach
Verne Canfield, ‘‘is that
whenever there is a problem,
we as a team stop and discuss
it. Good communication is im-
portant in dealing with pro-
blems.”’

After back-to-back losses to
ODAC rivals Lynchburg and
Eastern Mennonite, Canfield
and his team sat down last week
and, in a series of private con-
ferences, discussed the slump
the Generals had fallen into.

At least initially this “‘clean-
ing of the air,” as Canfield
referred to it, has paid off.

Last Saturday the Generals
took a step toward getting back
on a winning track as they roll-
ed past ODAC rival Maryville
College, 77-64, at the Warner
Center.

Late Score:

E&H 70
WA&L 60

Against Maryville the
Generals started a five-man
line-up which included, for the
first time this season, freshman
forward John Graves.

Senior co-captain Carby Hoy,
was moved to point guard to
replace the injured George
Spears. Junior Clark New join-
ed Hoy in the back court at the
other guard position.

Capitalizing on the changes in
the W&L line-up, the Scots ap-
plied full-court pressure early
in the game, forcing several

turnovers. But W&L began to
break the press soon
thereafter; taking control of the
game as the first half progress-
ed.

Commented Canfield: ‘We
put some people in some
strange positions and they
responded well for us. Clark

(New) and Carby (Hoy),
although they had a few more
turnovers than I would have lik-
ed, played well, considering the
situation.”

After holding a 34-29 halftime
edge, the Scots threatened
momentarily in the second half.
The Generals regained their
composure, however, and cruis-
ed to the 13-point victory.

W&L’s starting five scored all
but two of the team’s total
points.

New led the way with a game-
high 21 points, followed closely
by Smitherman, who con-
tributed 20 points and blocked
four shots. Hanson chipped in 14
points and grabbed seven re-
bounds, while Hoy and Graves
netted ten points apiece. In ad-
dition, Graves pulled in eight
rebounds.

“Graves did a good job star-
ting and will continue to play
that way for us,’ noted Can-
field. Yet Canfield added that
the Maryville game was impor-
tant because the defense had
again begun to respond.

Said the coach: ‘‘A basketball
season runs a long time and
people had begun to forget their
roles. Everyone was trying to
be a scorer. Against Maryville,
we denied them the easy
baskets inside.”’

Rich Suttle, Maryville’s
senior forward and leading
scorer, was held to just ten
points, making only four
baskets from the floor in 12 at-
tempts.

On Saturday, the Generals
will get a chance to avenge their
earlier loss to Lynchburg as
W&L hosts the Hornets at
Warner Center. Game time is 8
p.m.

Rugby Club Looks To Improve Program

by David Dehay

In its January 19 meeting, the
Executive Committee approved
an $850 grant to the W&L Rugby
Club. Despite the fact that the
club’s request for $1200 was
denied, sponsor Lawrence
Babits and club president Alex
Richards are quite happy with
the grant.

“T’m grateful for any kind of
support,” said Babits, who
teaches in the Anthropology
department. ‘“‘I think if the EC
gives us any money at all we’re
doing okay.”

“T think the EC has always
been real nice to us about fun-
ding,” added Richards, a
senior. “We keep real good
financial records, so they know
exactly where the money is go-
ing. Therefore, when we ask for
money, the EC really knows we
need it.”’

“We could have used more
money,’’ Richards concluded,
‘‘but I was very appreciative of
what we got.’’

Babits explained that a key
part of the budget was destined
for the construction of a scrim-
maging machine. ‘‘The football

ee
(el

ic

equivalent would be a blocking
sled, but the spacing between
the pads is different,’’ Babits
said. ‘‘They usually run around
$1200 to $1400, but we can buy
the lumber and build one
ourselves for $300 to $400. I’ve
built one before, and I figure we
can do it over the Washington
Holiday.”

Both Babits and Richards are
very optimistic about the
Rugby Club’s upcoming spring
season, beginning March 7 with
a home game against the
University of Richmond.

“I think we’re going to do real
well this spring,’ said Babits.
“We're going to have some
rugby players who didn’t par-
ticipate this fall.

‘“‘We’ve got a lot of players,
including many new people,”’
said Richards. ‘‘We had about
50 people at our last practice,
and I expect more to show up in
the future.”

Babits feels the team has im-
proved since the beginning of
the season last fall. ‘‘We played
six games and lost them all,” he

said. “We started with three
players who had played rugby
before and lost our first game,
42-0. In our last game we played
an even better team, shut them
out in the second half, and
would have beaten them if we
had had 10 more minutes. We
just made a lot of beginners’
mistakes at first.”’

Babits and Richards stressed
that anyone is welcome to join
the club, and everybody will
have an opportunity to play.

“We'll have numerous oppor-
tunities for players because we
have such a large schedule,,’
Richards said. The team has
about 18 games scheduled, in-
cluding a tour of North
Carolina. ‘“We’ve scheduled a

lot of double weekends on our
home games so that everybody
will get to play,’’ he added.

‘‘We’ll have a chance to play
some top-flight teams, and I
think we’ll not only be more
competitive, but win more
games than we lose,’’ Babits
Stated. ‘‘It looks a lot better now
than it did two games into the
season last fall.”’

Jones Named Baseball Coach

by Phil Murray

Craig Jones, a 1980 graduate
of Virginia Military Institute,
was named head baseball coach
Thursday night, filling the post
left open by last week’s resigna-
tion of Chuck Kroll.

Jones will function as interim
coach for the remainder of the
season.

Athletic Director Bill
McHenry termed the Norfolk,
Va., native ‘‘the most qualified
person for the job.”’ Jones’ im-
mediate availability also con-
tributed to his selection.

At VMI, Jones was a four-

year letterman in both football .
fw) wi

Aluin-Bennis

Since 1963

and baseball. On the diamond,
he played shortstop and pitched
in the starting rotation.

However, Jones is best known
for his achievements as the
VMI place-kicker. He was All-
Southern Conference in 1977,
78, and 79.

Jones was drafted by the New
York Giants, but sat out for the
entire football season with a
muscle pull in his leg. The
Giants, however, thought
enough of Jones to keep him on
the injured reserve list. He will
rejoin the team in July for
another try at professional foot-

 

ball.
Jones excelled off the playing

field as well. He graduated
with a B.A. in English and
received Academic All-
American honors three times.
He also distinguished himself
with two U.S. Army Superior
Cadet awards in 1977 and 1978.

Chuck Kroll resigned as head
coach last week to take a full-
time position at the Colorado
School of Mines, where he will
be an assistant lacrosse and
football coach.

Kroll had coached the team

for two years.

Indoor Track Season Begins,

W&L Places Third

by Rick Swagler

The W&L indoor track team
held its first meet last Thursday
night in Lynchburg. W&L plac-
ed third in a field of six, com-
posed of Lynchburg College,
Bridgewater College, High
Point College, Roanoke College,
and Radford College.

Individually for W&L, Russ
Rector placed fourth in the high
jump and fifth in the long jump.
John McKee placed fourth in
the shot put, while Alan Ar-
mitage took third place in the
60-yard high hurdles. The team
of Jenevein, Brod, and the
Kadesky twins collected the se-
cond place award in the 440-
yard relay.

Coach Norris Aldridge was
“pretty happy about the results
for this early in the season,”’ but

added that ‘‘we need a lot more
work.’’ Looking ahead,

Aldridge noted that “by the
ODAC championship (Feb-
ruary 28), we'll be in good
shape.”

Like most coaches, Aldridge
is using indoor track as practice
for the spring track season.
However, team member Jon
Kelefant believes that ‘“‘we
should just blow off indoor track
and save the money.”’ He refer-
red to the indoor season as a

series of ‘‘expensive time
trials.” He called Lynchburg *‘a
terrible place to run’’ because
of the shortness of the track (12
laps to the mile), and the fact
that it is unbanked, but remark-
ed that everyone else — except
Lynchburg — ran under the
same disadvantage.

Howard Herndon, primarily a
one and two-mile runner, looked
at the indoor season as “‘a train-
ing stage which should not be
considered as separate from the
outdoor season.”’ Herndon said
that he ‘‘must work harder’’ to
compensate for a lack of
natural speed. Herndon is op-
timistic about the outdoor
season, citing ‘‘more quality
with most of our key people
returning.” He also named
freshman Paul Chapman as an
up-and-coming team member.

When asked about the track
facility available at VMI, both
Herndon and Kelafant com-
pared it to a “community’’
track, saying that ‘‘when we use
it, it’s like our own.”’ Herndon
commented that if W&L were a
Division I school, construction
of an indoor facility could be
justified to improve recruit-
ment. Both Herndon and Kela-
fant stated that track was not
their primary reason for com-

ing to W&L.

The next meet will be the VMI
Relays this Saturday. Among
the schools expected to compete
are Davidson, VPI, U.Va., Ten-
nessee, Maryland (where the
world record holder in the in-
door 60-yard high hurdles and
outdoor 120-yard high hurdles,
Renaldo Nehemiah, ran until
several weeks ago), and a host
of other schools. The meet
begins at approximately 11 a.m.
Saturday and will end about
5:30.

SKLSAKKKSANWHNKKNHH HHH HH

You can expect the unusual
with Washington and Lee track.

During a recent distance run
in preparation for the upcoming
indoor season, a group of eight
Generals came across a
sizeable brush fire in a pasture
outside of town. Good deed
doers all, they risked new shoes
and warm-up suits to battle the
blaze to the finish. When the
work was done, the group
brushed itself off and, as the
local fire department arrived at
the scene, trotted off into
anonymity. As one General put
it, ‘‘we just collected ourselves
and headed into the sunset, just
like the Lone Ranger after a
day’s work.”’

Wrestlers Start Comeback,
Capture Two Matches —

by John Harrison
The performance of the W&L
wrestling team in its last two
meets was not surprising or
even unexpected, given the
strength of the opponents.
Nonetheless, for a team that
has had every break go against
it, last week’s wins against
Hampden-Sydney and _ Long-
wood were a strong indication:
that the team has realized if it
preseveres through the difficult:
times, then success will be
realized.

The 27-24 victory over the
Tigers was especially pleasing
for the Generals, according to
coach Gary Franke. ‘‘They (H-
S) placed higher than us in the
W&L_ Invitational,’ said
Franke, ‘because they have
better wrestlers in certain
weight classes and _ they
benefited from that. Overall,
though, I knew we matched up
well against them. It was a
question of whether or not we
would take advantage of the
situation.”

Deserving particular notice is
captain Dave Stoeffel’s pinning
of last year’s 177-pound ODAC
champion, Howard Cobb. Scott
Mason, Greg Coy and Win
Sisson also recorded falls over
their opponents, while Tim
Valliere posted an impressive
15-8 victory.

Some of the luster of last

 

Saturday’s 35-24 contest of
Longwood was diminished
because the Lancers had no
alternates and were forced to
cede several matches. In the
matches that did take place,
Valliere, Mason, Sisson and
Stoeffel had pins and Richard
Kopelman posted a 16-13 tri-
umph.

Their latest victory raised the
Generals’ duel-meet record to
4-5.

The remaining four meets
promise to be more challeng-

ing.

Next Wednesday’s

    

meet will be at home, as Divi-
sion I James Madison provides
the opposition in Warner Center
at 7:30p.m.

Before then, the Generals
must take on a tough field in
this Saturday’s Pembroke In-
vitational. The season will then
come to an abrupt end with
back-to-back meets with David-
son and Catawba on the 13th
and 14th.

Coach Franke knows that his
team will have to be at its best if
it hopes to win any of those
meets.

Scott Mason hangs tough.

George Spears

by Ed Gonsalves
_ It all began with a burnt
jersey.

As a freshman on the 1978-79
Washington and Lee University
basketball team, George Spears
encountered some _ unsettling
troubles with his uniform.

“I was not able to wear my
jersey because my name was
burned by the press which
prints the letters,’ the per-
sonable athlete from Annan-
dale, Va. begins. ‘I regretted
not owning a team jersey. It
may sound kind of funny, but at
the time I felt apart from the
team.”

As a sophomore, however,
things began to change. First,
he acquired the long-sought and

much-coveted jersey. Then,
unexpectedly, he acquired a
starting position for the
Generals.

As a freshman, Spears had
seen action in just three of the
Generals’ 27 games, scoring 12
points and registering six
assists. As a sophomore, he was
thrust into the starting line-up
at point guard and, after an
understandable period of ad-
justment, responded with a 10.4
scoring average and a team-
high 89 assists. W&L won its
conference tournament and ap-
peared in NCAA Division III
Regionals, where George earn-
ed All-Tournament honors.

‘It took me a while to become
comfortable with the starting
position,’’ he explains. ‘“The
team had to adjust to me, just
as I had to adjust to the team.

Le
Spears Excelling
At Point Guard

 

We had to mold together.”

Before the W&L team could
mold, however, Spears had to
be sure he himself had molded
to the guard position.

‘In high school I was a
shooting guard, always moving
without the ball so I could get to
the open spot,’”’ the Flint Hill
Prep graduate comments. “But
at W&L I’ve become the guy
who brings the ball upcourt and
looks for the open man. It re-
quires a bit more organiza-
tion.”’

While Spears has learned
basketball organization, he for-
tunately has not left the
shooting skills behind.

“George handles himself well
on the court,”’ offers head coach
Verne Canfield, presently in his
17th year as W&L basketball
mentor. ‘The players have con-
fidence now that George will
perform well, and George has
not disappointed them. He’s
proving himself to be a fine
point guard.”

He is also proving himself as
a student, something for which
he credits W&L’s basketball
program.

“Playing Fasketball, or any
sport for that matter, and going
to a school which is academical-
ly oriented, is tough. But if you
become disciplined enough to
think ahead, you can win. In
fact, Coach Canfield has
statistics to show that our team
carries a higher grade point
average while in season than in
the off-season.”’

Swimmers Beaten

By William & Mary

by Phil Murray
The W&L swimming team’s
hopes for a winning record this
season were dimmed last
weekend as they lost to William
and Mary, 71-42.
Coach Page Remillard had
little to say concerning the meet
in Williamsburg, which saw his
team’s record fall to 3-4.
Co-captain Mike Bernot and
freshman Tim Rock continued
to excel, as each earned two vic-
tories. Bernot was victorious in

the 100-yard freestyle (48.6) and
the 200-yard free (1:47.8). Rock
won in the 500-yard free (4:58.0)
and 1000-yard free (10: 10.4).

Remillard seems more con-
cerned with the Davidson and
Furman meets this weekend.
‘“‘We have two difficult meets
this weekend; if we’re tough
we'll win them, if we’re not we
won’t.”’

The Generals will be looking
once again to attain their goal of
a winning record.
