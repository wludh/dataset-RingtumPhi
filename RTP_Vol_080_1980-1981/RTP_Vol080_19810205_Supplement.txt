Fancy Dress Ball

ON BROADWAY

by Mike Perry
Washington and Lee’s
seventy-fourth annual Fancy
Dress Weekend, one of the na-

tion’s premier college
weekends, is slated for
February 26, 27, and 28.

Although the event has changed
a great deal throughout its long
history, the events’ style and
character is still best
represented at the Fancy Dress
Ball.

In the old days, Fancy Dress

CAMELOT

Mr. F.D.’s first stop will pro-
bably be in Camelot, formerly
Evans Dining Hall, the room

will be decorated to depict a

medieval castle scene complete
with flags and _ banners.

SAB plans to decorate the room
with white candlelit tables and
beautiful floral arrangements.
Harmonia Gardens will be fur-

of Broadway by the fact that
Lowenbrau light and dark beer
will be served.
42ND STREET

After leaving Harmonia
Gardens, Fancy Dress revelers
will be sure to notice the mar-
quis above the Cockpit entrance
to the University Center which
marks a-tribute to one of Broad-

   

 

   

A crowded dance floor is common at Fancy Dress, but no one seems to be complaining. This year’s

ballroom theme is ‘‘Camelot.’’

ticipants came attired in
elaborate costumes. Today,
black tie dress is the costume of
the evening but the seventy-five
keg gala affair serves to
perpetuate a rich tradition.
Each Fancy Dress is perhaps
best remembered for the
elaborate decorations
employed to depict the selected
theme. This year should prove
to be no exception. The Student
Activities Board has been work-
ing diligently to transform the
Early-Fielding Student Center
into a tribute to some of Broad-
way’s finest productions.
Utilizing the theme of ‘‘On
Broadway,’ SAB officials have
strained their creative genius to
produce the kind of event that
W&L students have come to ex-
pect at Fancy Dress. SAB co-
chairman Jamie Small claims
that this year’s extravaganza
“will be loaded with more
entertainment than ever.”
THEATRE LOBBY
Drawn to the student center
by two searchlights, this year’s
Fancy Dress goer and his date
will enter the ball through one
of the two entrances to Evans
Dining Hall, which will be
decorated to resemble a theatre
lobby. SAB members plan to

way play with a throne and
several court jesters roaming
about. The room’s main attrac-
tion, however, will be Peter
Duchin and his orchestra,
whose performance is expected
to be broadcast live on WLUR.
The SAB also plans to dispense
much of the beer from some of
the 75 kegs of Erlanger and
Milwaukee light slated for the
evening from a bar running the
width of the room.
THE WIZ
Upon leaving Camelot,many
Fancy Dress goers will venture
down the hallway above the
Cockpit along a yellow brick
road decorated to recreate a
scene from ‘the Wiz’’. The
hallway can also be identified
by the official Broadway poster
and a rainbow on the ceiling
featuring a spectrum of bright
colors.
HELLO DOLLY
Led by a green canopy rug,
Mr. F.D. and his date may elect
to enter Harmonia Gardens,
formerly the Cockpit — the area
will be transformed into the
restaurant in the Broadway hit
“Hello Dolly.” Room Full of
Blues, a New Orleans jazz band
will play a variety of Louis
Armstrong and other hits. The

way’s newest hits ‘42nd
Street.’’ The hallway’s Broad-
way motif will be further
enhanced by recreated theatre
fronts and publicity posters of
selected plays. Along the op-
posite wall, SAB organizers
plan to paint a city skyline with
a Silver sky and ‘‘thousands’’ of
tiny lights to depict stars and
lend an exciting, carnival-like
atmosphere to the scene.
SHOWBOAT

After a stroll down 42nd
Street, Mr. F.D. and his date
may elect to cross over a
wooden plank into Fairfax
Lounge and onto a recreation of
a steamboat. Riverbank foliage
and a ship’s railing will be used
to depict a Mississippi River
scene complete with signal flag,
ringbuoys, lanterns and a pad-
dlewheel. One of the Lounges
walls will be decorated to repre-
sent an entrance into the rest of
the boat.

WEST SIDE STORY

After disembarking, Fancy
Dress goers may choose to ven-
ture down the EC hallway
through an alleyway decorated
with bricks, trashcans and, a
fire escape to recreate a scene
from the Broadway smash
“Westside Story.’ Mr. F.D.

may even feel the urge to leave
his own mark on this year’s
event. SAB organizers realize
this and encourage Fancy
Dress. goers to bring magic
markers and write graffiti on
the alley’s paper walls.

OKLAHOMA

Mr. Fancy Dress and his date
may next be lured by the coun-
try and western sounds of
Riders in the Sky into the EC
room, decorated with
checkered curtains and
possibly a covered wagon to
depict a country barn. Ranger
Bob and Too Slim will supply
the room’s entertainment com-
plete with an electric campfire
and tumbleweeds.

A CHORUS LINE
When Mr. F.D. has had his fill

on Ranger Bob and Too Slim, he
may elect to escort his date
upstairs past the University
Center television rooms and
down ‘“‘A Chorus Line.’’ This
hallway will be decorated with
the play’s official publicity
poster and a silhouette of a
chorus line.

GREASE

After making a stage-left ex-
it, Mr. F.D. .and his date will
probably enter one of the two
T.V. rooms into an SAB recrea-
tion of the room will be
decorated as a parking lot com-
plete with rearview mirrors on
the walls and foam dice hanging
from the ceiling. On the
other side of a partition SAB
members plan to construct a
malt shop where Wedsel’s
Edsels is scheduled to churn out

year’s ball.

One of the two searchlights which will mark the location of this

a complete 1950’s style musical
show.
CABARET

After a couple of malts Mr.
F.D. will no doubt want to
‘‘bop”’ down to the Cabaret, that
is Room 114 redecorated as the
inside of a 1930s German burles-
que. Centerstage will feature
Bill Clary, a comedian-
magician who will dazzle au-
diences with such feats as saw-
ing third-year law _ student
Susan May in half and making
Carole Chappell disappear.

MY FAIR LADY

If you’re looking for a place to
relax, or maybe just pass out,
the SAB plans to furnish one of
the side dining halls with tables
and chairs in the design of the
grandstand from the hit “My
Fair Lady’’ complete with
flowers, a winners circle and a
gazebo — no horses.

THE KING ANDI
In the dining room across the
way the SAB plans to recreate a
Japanese tearoom decorated

with murals, buddhas and
geisha girls.
TICKET INFORMATION

Tickets for Fancy Dress ’81
are scheduled to go on sale Mon-
day, February 23 from 10 to 4
p.m. in front of Carole

Challelle’s office in the Univer-
sity Center. The price for a
ticket is $20.00. Souvenir grain-
cups will be sold at three for a
dollar, and posters for two
dollars a piece.

Duchin To Supply Swing

by John Wells

The SAB has chosen the Peter
Duchin Orchestra to play at the
main ball in Evans Dining Hall
during the Fancy Dress hoopla
in keeping with the On Broad-
way theme, the show
represented in the ballroom will
be Camelot.

Duchin may or may not know
about the Camelot selection.
But it doesn’t matter because,
among bandleaders or anyone
else, pianist Duchin has emi-
nent Camelot qualifications.
Not only was he raised by
Democratic stalwarts like the
Averell Harrimans, but his
band played for President John
F. Kennedy at the White House
and he has been a longtime
friend of the one and only
Jackie O.

Duchin maintains an aura of
that brief period in American
politics, and he certainly looks
like a jet-setter. It is especially
fitting that he comes to W&L’s
Fancy Dress immediately
following Bob Crosby and
Lester Lanin. Crosby is
representative of the big band

The Year They Cancelled

by Chris Peacock

The history of the Fancy
Dress Ball contains some most
interesting and_ colorful
moments. A look back at Fancy
Dresses past reveals themes
which range from the European
Courts of the Gilded Age to the
antebellum South to, and get
this, Heaven itself.

Those were the days when the
Age of Swing spread the fame of
Fancy Dress to wherever

 

     

Dress histor In

era in which Duchin’s father,
the late Eddy Duchin, made it
big. Lanin has made his name
playing for the privileged at
debutante balls, bar mitzvahs,
wedding receptions and various
country club dances. Duchin
plays big band (jazz is his
favorite) and has made big
bucks on the Lester Lanin cir-
cuit.

Duchin was born in 1937. His
father had married New York
socialite Marjorie Oelrich in
1933, and Mrs. Duchin died six
days after her son’s birth. She
had been a close friend of the
first Mrs. Averell Harriman,
and Peter was raised by the
Harrimans at their Manhatten
townhouse and country estate.
(Averell, you know, was Gover-
nor of New York before he was
FDR’s Moscow envoy.) His
youth was spent among power-
ful Democrats, high society and
show business _ personalities.
His father died of leukemia in
1951.

Duchin was a music major at
Yale, and studied piano and
performed in Paris for two

side the building reach about as
far up as the exclusive Fancy

reaches out.)

But if you want a really uni-

to look 10 years back.

returned to New York and
formed the Peter Duchin or-
chestra in 1958, and played for
two years at the famous St.
Regis Hotel. The band was a
huge success, playing for the
Kennedys, the Rockefellers and
the Duke and Duchess of Wind-
sor.

The extended St. Regis gig led
to other engagements; and
Duchin has been on_ the
debutante circuit ever since. He
has played at the White House
wedding receptions of both
Johnson girls, the 1976
Democratic National Conven-
tion, and the inaugural balls of
Jimmy Carter and Ronald
Reagan. Duchin is booked up
now past 1987.

A primary attraction of
Duchin’s music is the variety of
it. He can move from Bach to
Gershwin to Elvis to Rolling
Stones to Donna Summer with
relative ease. Fancy Dress Ball
and the Camelot theme will pro-
vide a suitable showcase for
Duchin’s talent and versatility.

That’s because there was no
Fancy Dress Ball that year.

Imagine that. ‘‘The outstan-
ding collegiate social event of
the south” didn’t even happen
in 1971.

(The New York Times made
that reference to the ball back
in the 1930s, but the phrase con-
tinues to be repeated each year
in newsletters to prospective
freshmen. )

In a way the demise, albeit
temporary, should not seem so
surprising, what with the way
traditions were dying by the

dozens here and elsewhere in
those days.

Everything from parietals in
W&L dorms to coats and ties
worn to class was biting the
dust.

Other things were markedly
different then, too.

The Ring-tum Phi observed
that ‘‘No one seems to be weep-
ing over the plight of the frater-
nity system.’

And Chicago Seven defen-
dants Jerry Rubin and David
Dellinger spoke at Wilson Field
to an assemblage called ‘‘The
Shenandoah Festival for Peace

No one seemed to notice the
death of Fancy Dress.

The Phi spent a _ whole
paragraph on the matter.

Nobody even wrote a letter to
the editor. Talk about apathy,
simple tables left in the rain
means a letter or two for the
SAB even in those days.

Even those who were in on the
decision could not agree on the
cause.

The Planning Behind Fancy Dress

by Frank Billingsley

Begin with one Student Ac-
tivities Board, stir in a theme
that will appeal to an entire stu-
dent body, add hundreds of man
hours of hard work, sprinkle in
a mere $35,000 — and you’ve got
Washington and Lee Fancy
Dress Ball 1981.

In the past, it’s been written
up in The Washington Post and
Time magazine, coined byTown

and Country ‘‘most prestigioius
social event of the
Southern collegiate communi-
ty’’ (or so rumor has it), and not
a student recruitment tour goes
by without some reference to it.
Fancy Dress is the event that
the old alums never forget and
that the new freshmen eagerly
anticipate.

And so it is. But most of those
people who attend Fancy Dress
never see more than brightly
colored wall-paper, fancy
decorations, good entertain-
ment, and long lost friends
—and this they see with blurred
vision. All it seems to be is a
$200, four-day drunk at the end
of February. Nobody realizes it
all began way back in
September...

Twenty-eight SAB members
close their meeting to outsiders
and lower their voices. The
Fancy Dress theme is about to
be discussed and choices of
bands has to be narrowed down.
First order of business is to look
at the budget — and that
resulted in a five-dollar raise in
ticket prices this year.

Perhaps the most important
task is finding a theme for
Fancy Dress. Everyone starts
throwing ideas around A
Western theme? The Orient?
Riverboat? Roaring Twenties?
Wizard of Oz? Carribbean? For
one reason or another, nothing
is quite right. But not to fear,
there always seems to be one
theme that everybody goes for.
This year it was ‘Broadway’.

But what could be better?
There are twelve rooms to fill
and Broadway lends itself to
enough sub-themes to do it.
Well, thank God, that’s settled.

Then the entertainment. Hun-
dreds of band names are
brought before the SAB for
voting. This one if we can’t get
this one, but if we can get this
one then don’t get that one,
unless we can’t get the other
one, but see if we can. Then
calls to talent agencies to line
up street vendors, comedians,
mimes, magicians, jugglers
and anything else that sounds
interesting and entertaining.
Can we get somebody to eat live
rattlesnakes?

Then subcommittees have to
be delegated. There are sub-
committees for papercutting,
artwork, entertainment, con-
struction, publicity, and sub-
committees for subcommittees.
Security has to be lined up,
building and grounds has to be
lined up, a photographer has to
be lined up, the beer supplier
has to be lined up, and the Din-
ing Hall and Cockpit to be lined

up. Someone has_ to
handle coats, and don’t forget
the baby grand for Peter
Duchin.

Then’ the ordering.
Everything has to be ordered.
Wall paper, posters, special
decorations, special lighting,
wood nails, hammers, saws,
staples, stapleguns, paper
cutters, glue, glitter, tape,
fabric. The FD grain cups, the
FD posters, the FD tickets, the
FD coins, the FD photos, the FD
souvenirs. Ordered, re-ordered,
sent back, and re-reordered.
And still no one knows if it will
all turn out right.

As the magic date gets closer
things get more definite. Con-
tracts are sent in, signed,
returned, signed, and sent back.

 

SAB member Danny Raskin, Co-Chairmen Pryse Elam and Jamie
Small, with member Ed Kramer.
‘I'ne artwork gets the final okay

begins. Day in and day out for
months paper is cut, measured,
and fitted for size. Re-cut, re-

measured, and re-fitted for size.

until seven o’clock Friday night
will the final touches be put on.
It’s a process that begins
unendingly in September. It
takes six months of prepara-
tion, thousands upon thousands
of dollars, and lots of sweat and
frustration. All for a four hour
party. If Town and Country
didn’t call Fancy Dress the
most prestigious social event in
the Southern collegiate com-
munity, they should have,

Thursday Night

by Ross Newell

Get ready to kick back W&L; John Prine is scheduled to open the
74th Fancy Dress festivities with a Thursday night concert in
Warner Gymnasium.

Prine is prime. His show, planned for 8 until 10 p.m., has been
billed as ‘“‘An Evening with John Prine.” During this evening don’t
expect to get pounded by a punk or swamped by a new wave. Prine
doesn’t wear funny sun glasses, and he won’t whip it in public.

He will provide a nice change of pace from the commercially
oriented material that dominates contemporary music. Prine has
never succeeded commercially. AM radio programmers have
traditionally overlooked the unique and engaging for the overwork-
ed and superficial and, Prine’s work, much to the artist’s credit,
has been no exception. He has yet to sell out and conform to the
wishes of recording agents or album executives.

Prine was an average American. After a stint in the army, he
returned to his native Chicago and started delivering mail. In 1970
he stopped delivering mail and began writing songs. The change of
pace did Prine right.

He’s not an average American anymore. His debut album, a 13-
song collection released in 1971, established him as a leading
American songwriter. His lyrics are direct and often biting. He
does not bore listeners with tales of teenage teases or other topics
typically covered by pop songwriters.

Prine does offer listeners as complete and interesting a course in
recent social history as any university professor could. Prine is a
social commentator, a realist with the ability to see the truth and to
tell it in his songs.

For this ability, Prine has received various honors. Time
magazine cited ‘‘Bruised Orange”’ as one of the top ten albums
released in 1978. Bette Midler and Joan. Baez have recorded his
songs, and Prine has been credited with the social observation of
Woody Guthrie and the emotional purity of Hank Williams. The
quality of his lyrics have led some critics to compare him to Bob
Dylan.

Some of Prine’s lyrics sting, others amuse. The lyrics in ‘Sam
Stone’”’ sting. The song, about a morphine-addicted Vietnam
veteran, leaves the listener wondering about the glory of being a
veteran of a foreign war. Prine describes the war’s human affect,
the ultimate result being ‘‘a hole in daddy’s arm where all the
money goes.”’

However, Prine has a lighter side. Songs like ‘‘Dear Abby”
amuse. The artist does mock versions of letters written to
America’s all around problem solver, Abby. Minus his touch of in-
sight and wit, Prine’s rendition of the letters seems to come from
the Dear Abby column in your local newspaper. As American as
station wagons and cook outs in the country is the young stud who
finds himself in a compromising situation.

‘Dear Abby, Dear Abby I never thought that me and my gir-
friend would ever get caught. We were sitting in the back seat
just shooting the breeze, her hair up in curlers, her pants at her
knees. Signed, just married.”’

The medium for Prine’s message has varied over the past ten
years. Initially his albums and concerts were characterized by an
acoustic approach. In this role, as a folk singer, Prine built much of
his reputation and following Prine’s debut album had two primary
parts, his lyrics and his work on the acoustic guitar.

However, Prine began moving towards a folk-rock style. He add-
ed a band both in the studio and on the road. In 1975 the album
“Common Sense’’ featured Prine’s new musical stet direction.
‘Bruised Orange’’, 1978, and ‘‘Pink Cadillac,”’ 1979, continued the

 

 

John Prine

artist’s personal trend towards a stronger rock orientation.

Yet, even when the rock influence was at its height Prine often
took time out during concert appearances to pull up a stool and an
acoustic guitar and return to his folk music roots.

Prine will appear at W&L as the folk musician and the songwriter
and without the addition of his band. In an attempt to make the con-
cert more personal, the Student Activities Board plans to seat con-
cert goers.in the bleachers. This should make the concert more en-
joyable for both Prine and his fans.

Also scheduled for Thursday night, beginning at 10:30 is a party
at Zollman’s Pavilion which will feature the rock’n’roll band
Tracks. The band, from Richmond, has played at W&L several
times and is scheduled to paly at the Dance-A-Thon. The admission
fee will be $2. No refreshments will be served, however, students
are encouraged to bring their own beverages.

The SAB originally planned to sponsor a Pavilion party after the :
Prine concert. However, SAB advisor Mike Cappetto advised |

 

 

John Prine
against such action. According to SAB co-chairman Jamie Small,
Cappetto felt the SAB lacked the man power and the time to pull off
two major events in one night.

Small said the SAB courted other organizations to see if they
would sponsor the party. No other takers could be found. The
university administration has never been overly fond of weeknight
parties and a fear of repercussions from the hill probably made
other groups think twice about sponsoring a weeknight party,
Small said.

At this point the party will either be sponsored by the Student Bar
Association or four or five undergraduates. The party is scheduled
to last until 1:30 a.m.

The SAB is sponsoring the John Prine concert and admission is
free. Prine is popular in Virginia and usually sells out his shows in
the state. He charges $6,000 for a solo concert appearance.
However, he promises to be worth the price.

So, around 8 p.m. on Feb. 26, break out your blue jeans, your
boots and your bowl, fit yourself with an illegal smile and wander
over to Warner gym. John Prine is a talented performer and an
awesome songwriter. If you miss him, you’ll miss more than a con-

cert.

 
 

Pavillion Party

Union

by Mike Perry

After spending a night on
Broadway, Fancy Dress con-
tinues on Saturday, February 28
at Zollman’s Pavilion with a
University grain party
sponsored by the Freshman
class. A class pass is required
for admission to the party
which is scheduled to start at 1
p.m. and continue until 6 p.m.

The event will feature two
bands and a variety of mixtures
containing 45 gallons of grain
alcohol in what Freshman Class
President Peter Collins says
will be “nothing out of the or-
dinary, but definitely a kickass
party.”

In selecting the afternoon’s
entertainment, Collins said he
tried to pick bands that would
be ‘“‘suitable to all tastes at
W&L.”’ Union Pacific, a ver-
satile band from Richmond, is
scheduled to start the afternoon

Fancy Dress Extras

by Charlie Randolph

Do you remember Fancy
Dress last year? Probably not.
Even if your date didn’t get
them all, you should remember
the souvenirs and memorabilia
you bought and or tore off the
walls of the student center. This
year, numerous reminders of
Fancy Dress will be made
available.

The Student Activities Board
will have 5,000 grain cups for
sale. The cup has a collage of
theatre marquees encircling it,
and it was designed by Len
Howard and Pryse Elam.

The SAB will also be selling a
Fancy Dress poster. The poster
was professionally designed
and printed by Silver Screen
Designs of Turner Falls, Mass.
They are the same designers
who printed the concert posters
for the New Riders of the Pur-
ple Sage and Sea Level. SAB co-
chairman Pryse Elam says,

Beginning at 4 p.m. and conti-

repertoire contains a variety of
rock hits by such artists as
Bruce Springsteen, Elvis

The fact that last year’s
Pavilion party was snowed out
doesn’t worry Collins who ‘“‘an-

weather.” Collins is, however,
concerned about the 65
freshmen who did not buy class
passes in September. Collins
urged everyone to buy a Pass

Designs wants to use this year’s
poster in their own ads because
they feel it’s the best work
they’ve ever done.”’ The posters
will cost two dollars each.

Fancy Dress commemorative
coins will also be given away at
Friday night’s ball. One side of
the coin has the face of Presi-
dent Washington and General
Lee. The other side has the
Washington and Lee general on
a rearing horse with a Broad-
way marquee in_ the
background. The coin was
designed by John Martin.

Three students will be selling
long-sleeve t-shirts. The shirt
has Fancy Dress: 1981 printed
on a front pocket, and the back
has a crowd of elegantly wasted
people on the corner of 42nd

was designed and printed by

Fancy Dress History

_ (continued from page 3)
would be no Fancy Dress
“because of a greatly reduced
budget and past history of stu-
dent disinterest.”’

Later, another Dance Board
member said the lack of funds
had forced the board to choose
between Fancy Dress and other
social. events. ‘“‘We thought it
was the weakest link in the
chain,”’ he said.

While no one seemed to notice
the official death of the eVent
back at the first of the school
year, come the beginning of the
calendar year and folks began
to take note.

One writer lamented in the
Phi that “The end of January
won’t bring eager young ladies
from all over the country whose
hearts have been set on ‘going
to the Fancy Dress Ball’ the
whole past twelve months. All
the end of January will bring is
income tax statements.

Think that guy took the loss
pretty hard? Then consider
what an alumnus wrote in a
state-wide magazine.

“For the old grad from
General Lee’s college it is the
most shattering break with the
past since the Generals dropped
out of big time football.”

In a more understanding tone
he added, ‘‘It would be idiotic to

 

PAA KEELE TIT ITETT

SHAWL COLLAR

expect modern collegians to
find the joy we did in a re-
creation of King Arthur’s Court,
broadcast live, no more than
they expect to find us at a rock
concert at Fillmore East.”’

As he wrote that, back at
W&L, on the weekend that pro-
bably would have been Fancy
Dress, was a concert featuring
the Allman Brothers Band and
Livingston Taylor. A month
later, the Allmans recorded a
live album at none other than
Fillmore East.

Also that weekend was a
Saturday afternoon party at
Zollman’s. Some things never
change, huh?

Well, almost. Instead of
grain, the freshman class pro-
vided ‘‘a limited bourbon mix
and steups for a Bring Your
Own Liquor party.’’ Music was
by The Eye.

So there was no Fancy Dress
10 years ago. That in itself is
hard to imagine.

Now try combining that with
the plans for the next year, and
contrast it with more recent
balls.

Fancy Dress was gone. But
not, at least in name, for long.

“Can Fancy Dress Return?”’
asked a Phi headline of March
10.

The problem, said an
editorial, “is not a lack of stu-
dent interest, but a lack of
funds.”’

The ball wasn’t such a bad
idea after all, it seems.

But the Dance Board wanted
a new affair. Forget the ‘‘com-
bination of imagination, in-
nocence, and _ snobbishness,”’
which is what that alumnus had
called the Fancy Dresses of old.

None of this black tie
business, either, said the
organizers.

“The cost is the inhibitive
thing,” said their chairman. “‘I
don’t want to spend more than
$2,500 to $3,000 on the thing.”’

And, said the newly-elected
Fancy Dress president, ‘My
philosophy is to bring it back,
but perhaps on a different for-
mat. I don’t want Peter Duchin
or...Glenn Miller. They won’t
attract enough people.”

So they had a '50s revival the
next year, with tickets costing
$5 apiece to see ShaNaNa in the
revival of the ‘‘outstanding col-
legiate social event of the
south.”’

And what about this year?

The price tag is about $36,000.

The dress is black tie.

The band is Peter Duchin’s.

ANYTHING TO GET OUT
OF A TRIAL

Here’s one way to avoid being
sent to jail. Tameka Easty, 26
of Houston, was facing a judge
for forgery charges when she
started screaming that she was
about to give birth. The
coutroom proceedings were
immediately stopped and an
ambulance was called. Easty
was taken to a nearby hospital
but officials said she still has
not given birth.

FAIRYLAND

“This is Fantasyland, not
fairyland’ a security guard told
admitted male ‘gays’’ who
were ejected from Disneyland
for dancing together this past
September on Date night. The
two gays then sued Disneyland
for violating their civil rights.
They sought damages and a
court injunction to nullify
Disneyland’s regulations pro-
hibiting persons of the same sex
from dancing’ together.
Although an Orange County
California Judge upheld the
Disneyland regulation, the pair
are determined to take their
case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

CHIMP TALKS WITH A BITE

Do you remember Washoe,
the talking chimp? — she’s the
first chimpanzee to learn
human sign language. Well, it
seems a prominent California
neurosurgeon was interviewing
Washoe and he reached over to
feed the chimp from a sack that
her trainer was_ holding.
Washoe must have interpreted
the move as an attack on her
trainer — she bit the doctor’s
finger off.

The doctor was told Washoe
flashed the sorry signal while
he washed off his wound.

GATORS AND MEAT EATING
FISH

Detroit police raided a
suspected dope headquarters
recently and found two four-foot
alligators and 30 flesh-eating
piranahas. Police say the
dealers used the animals to
scare people who bought drugs
from them.

And in other animals in the
news this week we have Agatha
the pet boa constrictor. It seems
the 6-'2 foot snake disappeared
for several months, only to
show up again a few blocks
away from home. Fortunately,
the snake had not eaten any of
the local residents.

NO MORE HASSLES
FOR HASSELMAN

A federal judge in New York
has ruled that a female lobby
attendant was wrongfully
dismissed from her job for
refusing to wear a “short,
revealing and sexually pro-
vocative’’ Bicentennial
uniform. Margaret Hasselman
had been previously employed
in a Manhattan building. “But
for her womanhood,” said U.S.
District Judge Robert Ward,
“Margaret Hasselman would
not have been required to
appear on her job...in a uniform
that subjected her to sexual
charassment.”’

Whatever happened to ‘‘if you
got it, flaunt it?”’

THE ABSENT-MINDED
PROFESSOR

From Orlando, Fla., comes a
report that a box containing
nearly 5000 pages of classified
material on nuclear propulsion
was accidently thrown away by
a Navy nuclear training school.
‘So who was elected to find the
documents amid all the
garbage? The students, of
course. Shifts of 15-30 students
spent three days looking
through piles of garbage for the
material, which accounts for
over 54 textbooks.

Almost half the papers, which
had been stored loosely or with
rubber bands around them,
were recovered in the search.
The rest of the papers are pro-
bably serving as seagull nests.

THE JURY FINDS THE
JUROR GUILTY

Serving on a jury can be ex-
cruciating, but missing it may
be even worse. Consider the
case of Karen Austin, 23, of Can-
ton, Ohio. Austin was supposed
to serve on a jury hearing a
rape trial, but missed the trial
because she overslept and
showed up two hours late. For
her negligence Austin, who had
spent the previous night
celebrating her 23rd birthday,
was fined $100 for contempt of
court and ordered to spend one
night in jail.

“Being in jail isn’t my
scene,’’ claimed Austin. ‘Here
I am Miss Straight and Narrow
of 1981, and I’ve been taken to
jail in a cruiser, fingerprinted
and photographed, and now I’m
a criminal.”

DON’T MAKE

In Baltimore, a _ Federal
district judge has upheld the ex-
pulsion of a Naval Academy
senior who participated in and
filmed a sexual encounter in-
volving five midshipmen, in-
cluding a woman, in an
academic dormitory. Judge
Joseph Young agreed with the
Navy’s decision to expell mid-
shipman Jamie Love for having
sexual intercourse with a
female classmate. Love said he
was disappointed with the deci-
sion, saying that he had been
only five months away from
graduating but now would have
to serve three years as an
enlisted man.

Apartheid at UVa.

The University of Virginia
should not manipulate its en-
dowment fund investments to
influence the issue of apartheid
in South Africa, the school’s
board of visitors decided this
week.

The statement came after
criticism from students who
urged the university to
withdraw its $23-million  in-
vested in firms with South
African operations. The board
passed a resolution which says,
“the university should not take
a position with respect to issues
of a political character.”

However, the resolution did
note that “assurance of a cor-
poration’s committment to
equal opportunity is a pre-
requisite to investment in the
firm.”

Only one member of the
board voted against the
measure.

YOU CAN HAVE YOUR
CAKE AND EAT IT TOO?
It sounded like a good idea
amid all the hoopla surrounding

President Reagan’s inaugura-
tion, but it proved to be a little
hard to swallow. Some zealous
bakers decided to create a
seven-foot, 3000 pound cake for
the inauguration, actually
made it, but then discovered
that the cake was too large to fit
through the doors of the
Kennedy Center and was too
soft to be reassembled.

So what do you do with a cake
of that size? Ship it to the first
person who wants it, of course,
which turned out to be the
Army-Navy Country Club.

ALL FOR A DATE

From Fayetteville, Ark.,
comes the news that a Universi-
ty of Arkansas freshman was
shot and killed by police after
apparently trying to get a date
at a local sorority. James
Taylor, 19, of North Little Rock,
was shot by police after ter-
rorizing a Delta Delta Delta in-
itiation dinner at gunpoint. One
sorority member said _ that
Taylor was apparently upset
with a woman who had refused
to date him.

Some of the women attending

‘ the dinner giggled until they

realized that Taylor was serious
about using his weapon. Police
say they opened fire on Taylor
after he aimed his shotgun at
one of the sorority members in
the dining room.

Weeknight
Party
Discussed

By SAB

by John Ran Smith

Several items were discussed
at Sunday night’s Student Ac-
tivities Board meeting, in-
cluding what co-chairman
Pryse Elam termed ‘‘a way
around” the administration’s
ruling that the SAB’s Thursday
night party during Fancy Dress
Weekend end by 10:30 p.m.

“The administration has said
that there will be no pavilion
party from 10:30 on,” Elam
said. Elam went on to mention
the ways in which the SAB could
hold the party, including the
facetious idea of having the
Executive Committee order the
SAB to sponsor the party.

A more practical idea Elam
mentioned, would be the plan to
have the party sponsored by
Bob Willis (EC President),
Willie Mackie (EC Vice-
President) and Elam. “That
way,” Elam continued, “‘if they
(the adminisration) come to us,
we can go to the EC.”’ The band
scheduled to play at the party if

TTES;
This weekend’s movie was

also announced by Elam.
‘Paint Your Wagon,”’ starring
Clint Eastwood and Lee
Marvin, is slated to be shown on
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
at8p.m. and7 p.m. Sunday.

Elam also announced that all
proceeds from the movie will go
to the Muscular Dystrophy
Danceathon.

In other discussion, last
weekend’s Winter Week-end
was termed a ‘‘big success’’ by
Elam. At Sunday’s meeting, no
count of the profits were made.

The progress of the work on
Fancy Dress was also dis-
cussed. 6,500 grain cups have
already been received and
posters are scheduled to arrive
on Feb. 25, according to Elam.
The price for the cups will be
three for $1 and posters will go
for $2 apiece.

The beer at this year’s ball,
according to Small, will be
supplied by the Joseph Schlitz
Company. Small said the SAB
uses a rotation method to
choose which brand of beer will
be served and this year was
Schlitz’s turn. Erlanger and Old
Milwaukee Light will be served
in the ballroom while dark and
light Lowenbrau will be served
in the Cockpit.

we wish them to be. And finally, of course, the third and, luckily,
the most insignificant at this time is the force of the courts. It is not
insignificant in the sense that it could radically change our entire
system like it could at UVa. or VMI. I think it’s radically different
because we've had very little interaction, comparatively, with the
courts. And I think the reason that’s the case is because students
control so much of the honor system.

Phi: You seem to be saying that much of the honor system’s
future lies with the EC’s ability to handle crises. What can the EC
realistically do?

Willis: It (the EC) can run a better orientation program. It could
run, maybe, a continuing type of education. It can strive to create a
better relationship with the law school. That was another outside
tension I failed to mention. Law students are coming from a
greater diversity of undergraduate schools in which they didn’t
have honor systems — that lying, cheating and stealing were handl-
ed by deans. We have to do a better job of getting those people into
our honor system and making them feel a part of it because they
are judged by a majority of undergraduate students. Many law
students call us ‘‘weanies.”’ We get no respect over there and part
of that is our failure not to go over there and help them have faith in
us. And, also, we have to be aware that in the handling of our cases,
that we remain loyal to the procedures that we outlined in the White
Book. From the White Book and the procedure therein, that’s
where we gain some type of ground legally — that’s where our
strength comes from.

Phi: Recently, a letter in the Phi criticized the role the EC plays
in honor hearings. What was your reaction to that letter?

Willis: The letter by Neil Sheehan? It’s a traditional argument
that’s brought up regularly and I hope that the committee on revis-
ing the White Book looks into it. There’s one thing, though, that I
would like to emphasize and that’s the word hearing — and I’m glad

you used that instead of the word trial which was in this letter. As a
matter of fact, I made the motion last year in the White Book
changes that the word trial be deleted in the few places it was in the
White Book. The purpose of an honor hearing is to see the facts of
the case and not to prosecute anyone. Indeed, there is no prosecu-
tion there. There’s no one that sets up a series of questions in an at-
tempt to trap the accused. As a matter of fact, when the witness
comes in, I read the statement that’s in there, and then I say, ‘“‘By
the way this is the way we usually run things, we’d like you to go in
a narrative fashion, telling us what you know about the possible
honor violation. Just tell your story and we’ll interject asking ques-
tions about specific, particular points.’”” And so what happens is
there’s no prosecution, it’s kind of an answer and facts session. As
far as being the prosecution, judge and jury, the prosecution, I
think, falls out. The judge as far as interpreting the facts or how the
procedure is run, the chairman has to rule on the admissibility,
the procedure and how things go, but is open to the advocates’ sug-
gestions. There’s no defense attorney, there are advocates — peo-
ple who give advice — and they didn’t even use to have that. I think
that’s an effort to shOw that although we don’t want to make it a
sort of adversary-type system, the need for objective advice is
there for the accused. It’s not an adversary-type system because
they don’t have anybody to attack. There’s only the committee and

the accused in there. If the EC ever turned to a system like, I

believe, at VMI where attorneys come from in town, the focus of the

committee would immediately deviate from the  truth-
ascertainment of the facts to who could present the best legal
arguments. There would be a twisting and turning of everything,
trying on one hand to convict the person. While on the other hand
getting him off. And we don’t want that. That ties into an argument
as to graduated penalties. One of the major arguments I have is
that when the EC finally deliberates, it doesn’t have to consider the
penalty, it can only consider the facts of the case and say to itself,
‘is this or is this not an honor violation?” They don’t have to con-:
sider which is more dishonorable, the theft of a five-dollar bill or '

cheating on a five percent question on a test.

Phi: You mentioned possible White Book changes. Being that
time of the year, what do you think ought to be done with the White

Book?

Executive Committee President ROB WILLIS
Willis: I hope that the White Book committee will first of all
revise many of the disjointed sentences and poor grammar. This
thing has been pieced together over the last five or ten years. There
used to be a President’s Handbook that had some of the procedures
and many of those have been incorporated into here. What I hope
the committee does would be to have a more explicit statement on
the explanation on page two. Finally, I would say that besides the
editing and deleting of repetition, I personally don’t think that
many of the things need to be in here as far as exactly what needs to
be said when a witness walks in. I hope that for statements like
polygraphs, psychological tests which allegedly determine the
truth or falsity of a witness’s statement, each EC will decide that.
Different cases and the validity of polygraph tests might change
over the years. I think the accused should be able to present any
evidence of any relevance at all as long as it has the slightest validi-
ty on his behalf. Finally, an overall look at the way the White Book
runs and the honor system — whether or not we’ve gone too far in
codifying honor in our procedures, whether or not we need to codify
more to protect ourselves from legal suits, and also whether or not
the hearing is set up in the best possible way. I wrote up a memo
that I plan to give to the committee which asks them to look into the
possibility of expanding the EC by two persons. That would provide
two people who would rotate on the committee as investigators,
they would investigate along with a third person from the school of
the accused. They would become witnesses in a hearing — more
adverse witnesses who would drop off the judging panel. The addi-
tion might come as a treasurer to the EC and another law student.

Phi: Two spring terms ago, we had a public honor trial. Two fall
terms ago, we had the Peter Engel trial. Last spring term we had
another public trial. Do you think there is a trend of people going
public with their cases and do you think the system is being abus-
ed?

Willis: No, although there is definitely a trend for people to go
public and I think part of that is because my freshman year, they
dropped the rule which said an appeal to a public hearing would go
on your university transcript. Assuming that all your best friends
know of the hearing or it’s a big thing, you really have no reason not
go to public. To me the main deterrent for going public has been
eliminated, and I think that’s fine because the EC is certainly
capable of making errors in judgment.

Phi: In a small community like W&L’s, do you think a student
can get a fair public trial?

Humanities Group Awards W&L Matching Grant

The National Endowment for
the Humanities has awarded
Washington and Lee University
a $200,000 challenge grant
which will be used to help
create a permanent endowment
for W&L’s innovative program
in applied ethics.

Under the NEH challenge
grant program, W&L is re-
quired to raise $3 in private fun-
ding for every $1 received in
federal monies.

That means W&L must
receive $600,000 in new or in-

Public Tria

creased private gifts by June,
1983, to qualify for the full
$200,000 grant.

The resulting $800,000 endow-
ment, which would also be part
of W&L’s $62-million develop-
ment program which is now in
its second and final phase will
provide permanent funding for
the program known as ‘‘Society
and the Professions: Studies in
Applied Ethics.”’

Begun in 1972 as an ex-
perimental project and later
developed under a three-year

grant from the Lilly Endow-
ment, the ethics program is
designed for undergraduates in
journalism, law, and medicine.
The program, directed by Dr.
Louis W. Hodges, includes year-
long seminars in ethics for the
undergraduates. As an integral
part of the overall program,
W&L sponsors annual three-day
symposiums during which prac-
ticing doctors, journalists, and
lawyers come to the campus to
join the undergraduates in an
analysis of the ethical dimen-

sions of their respective prufes-
sions.

A steering committee has
been established to spearhead
the fund-raising campaign over
the next three years. Included
on that steering committee are
Roger Mudd, Washington cor-
respondent for NBC-TV; Dr.
James H. Sammons of Chicago,
chief executive officer of the
American Medical Association;
A. Linwood Holton Jr. of
Washington, former Governor
of Virginia and vice-president

STEERER!

and general counsel of the
American Council on Life In-
surance; Matthew W. Paxton of
Lexington, president and editor
of the Lexington News-Gazette;
and Dr. A. McGehee Harvey of
Baltimore, professor of
medicine emeritus at Johns
Hopkins Medical School.

Washington and Lee was one
of 122 cultural and educational
institutions across the country
receiving NEH challenge
grants for 1981.

Washington and Lee was one
of 64 colleges and universities
across the country receiving
NEH challenge grants for 1981.

Phi: We ran an article last week about an honor trial at UVa., one

Willis: Yes. The efforts of confidentiality do not always work with
the EC but they work fairly well. We had prospective jurors in the
last public trial who thought they knew the facts of the case and
didn’t know anything about it at all. We were able to find students
who didn’t even know the accused or anything about the case.
Because most honor violations are on the undergraduate campus
and since the most impartial: people come from the law campus
because they know the least about it, the student has an advantage.

Phi: In the Engel case, the defendant went to a federal court and
had his trial reinstated. Do you think this set a precedent at
W&L, and is it a good or bad precedent, if it is indeed one?

Willis: Most of the handling of the thing was done by (Steve)
Abraham, Bo (Dudley), our counsel, the school’s counsel and the
President and the Dean. It is my understanding that there was a

reopening of the case on the position that it was to prevent in-_

justices. The case was reheard in its entirety. —

Phi: In this case, Engel said his Constitutional rights had been
violated. Does that, in effect, mean that any student found guilty of
an honor violation can go to a court and argue this?

Willis: Engel had a rehearing because the EC, for some reason,
voted to reopen the case. I don’t think there was any weakening,
legally, by the Engel decision because you can read back to Steve
Abraham’s letter to the Phi, which said that the decision to reopen
was not a Constitutional issue but to prevent an injustice.

Phi: Where, then, do you place the honor system and honor code?
Is it a law, a sub-law or what, exactly? _

Willis: That’s why I’m very hesitant to place it into a legal con-
text. I don’t know if we’re above or beyond the law, or anything like
that. I think we have to be aware of what’s going on in the real
world, but by the same token, I think we have to judge honor and
our procedures the best way we can. We must follow what we’ve
told people. We’ve been told by our counselor that the courts
change their opinions so much that we’re going to continue doing
what we do and let the court continue to do what they do until there
is such a clash that it becomes an issue. Even Engel, who ended up
suing the school, later came back and felt satisfied with the system.
He probably did not perceive that justice was done, but at least he
had faith in the system.

I think a lot of student governments:

are bogus - a lot of their activities

are meaningless. We hear the same

thing about our student government

at W&L.’

Phi: You read articles from papers that honor systems and stu-
dent governments are being voted down at large schools. Why do
you think this is occurring?

Willis: I think a lot of student governments are bogus — a lot of
their activities are meaningless. We hear the same thing about our
student government at W&L. And yet, I think we have three areas
which legitimatize our presence here. It gives student support.
First, there.are the committee appointments. Second, the alloca-
tion of money. Finally, the honor system. Because of that, I think
students realize consciously, if not unconsciously, that without the
Executive Committee, without the honor system being run by
students, that someone would have to enforce conduct here. The
logical choice would be administrators. It would make for a pretty
nasty place to live in.

which lasted three years. Do you think that this could occur at
W&L?

Willis: I don’t think so. I think the difference was a question as to
graduated penalties at UVa. I remember reading an article where
students were voting as to whether they wanted a single sanction
and Josh (Henson) was kind of bringing all this up so that if he was
found guilty, he could raise the question. The vote was part of the
deal, there was a bit of controversy around it. Here at W&L, I sense
a pretty definite committment to the sanction. There is also a belief
that if we follow the White Book, we can standy by our decision.
We’re pretty firm in our belief that we have a system which works
and our decisions are final. And we’re not going to belabor the
point. That might have been UVa.’s mistake. The whole size issue
of UVa. is another factor. They have such a diversity and their
graduate schools are so diverse.

‘We’re pretty firm in our belief

that we have a system which works
and our decisions are final. And
we're not going to belabor that point.

That might have been UVa’s mistake.’

Phi: What have been the major changes in the honor system in
your four years at W&L?

Willis: I think there are more procedural things which have been
added, more of an attempt to find clarity. I think also, judging by
records I have been able to see, the number of cases is increasing.
The number of investigations is increasing drastically. It seems to
me that over the past four years, the job of enforcing the honor
system has become more tedious work. There is more of a concern,
“are we following strictly the White Book?”’

Phi: What do you perceive the student body’s opinion of the EC to
be? Do you believe there is a sentiment that the EC is ‘“‘out to get
people?”’

Willis: I hope not. We shied away from some of the scare tactics
that old ECs used. I think there is always some questioning by
students because we do have to do things in confidence.

Phi: Do you think the EC should set up a separate honor commit-
tee, consisting either of students-at-large or EC members?

Willis: I think because of the increase of cases in the past five
years, it definitely warrants some considerations. Personally, I’m
not inclined to say that there should be a separate honor council
from the student government basically because the honor system
gives the EC a lot of legitimacy.

Phi: If you were to write a letter of advice to next year’s EC,
what would you tell them?

Willis: That would depend on how many people are returning
from this year’s committee. This year, I’m the only person who’s
returning. The years when there was only one returning member,
that person became the Nestor, ( the wisest and oldest of the
Greeks in the Trojan war) he had to answer every question.
Something that I constantly forget is to focus on good relations with
faculty members and the townspeople. There’s got to be more in-
corporation of the law school in everything we do. Every year,
we're severing the law school and that’s a terrible thought. That in-
cludes the honor system, it shows all the more when they put out
their own yearbook, their own newspaper. Finally, I would tell the
committee to keep a pulse on the student body as far as how to
perceive honor. Yet have faith in the system and enforce it to the
best of their ability.

How To Fight High Phone Bills

by John Heckert

Once a month, usually in the
second or third week, almost
everyone at W&L receives a let-
ter from the Centel Telephone
Company. Small though the
envelope may be, it usually
creates quite an uproar, com-
plete with a promise ‘‘not to call
that Hollins ------ again!”’

In a survey of more than 20
phone-bill payers, the average
monthly phone bill was in the
$20-$30 range. The high was
somewhere near $200. If you
find yourself somewhere in this
class of talkaholics then read
on. By familiarizing yourself
with long distance charges you
can save a neat sum.

If it’s not completely
necessary, don’t use the
operator. Operator-handled

calls include collect, coin and

credit card calls. We all know
collect calling is the biggest
money saver, but that is an en-
tirely different ballgame. As a
general rule of thumb, dial
direct. If, after several direct-
dial attempts, the call still
doesn’t go through then the
operator will put it through for
you and charge the lower rate.
Think twice about calling
person-to-person. The rates are
double those of any other call.

If you are calling long
distance to a business, say for a
job interview, make certain to
check for the WATS (Wide Area
Telecommunications Service)
‘800’ number, which can be
called toll-free.

If, during a call, you get a
wrong number, poor connection
or the line is cut off, call the
operator immediately so as not

to be billed.

Part of the problem that W&L
students face is the fact that
many of their calls are in-state
and long distance. There is
nothing to be done but suffer
these high rates. One benefit
Centel provides is ‘‘conference”’
calls wherein you can have a
multi-person conversation pro-
vided one person is calling long
distance.

Long distance rates are
reduced at different time of the
day. On weekdays before 5
p.m., full rates apply. After 5
p.m. they are cut by 35 percent.
At 11 p.m. rates are cut again
by another 25 percent making
the full reduction 60 percent.
This 60 percent cut is also good
on weekends prior to5 p.m.

Certain holidays of the year
also have reduced rates. Those

include New Year’s Day, July
4th, Labor Day, Thanksgiving
and Christmas. On those days,
the evening reduction rate ap-
plies to all direct-dial calls for
the entire day. On out of state
operator assisted calls, this rate
applies only to additional

   

€ typical habitat of the talkaholic. —

minutes.

If you follow these sugges-
tions and perhaps consider how
long you’re actually talking for

the amount you’re spending,

then your phone bill can be

reduced.

John Read: From Vietnam To Lexington

by Tom Baker

John Read’s personal history
sounds like something out of a
war movie witha happy ending.

After graduating from the
Virginia Military Institute in 1965
with a B.A. in history, Read began
a military career that he hoped
would culminate with his becom-
ing a general in the U.S, Army.

Read Vietnam,
however, and on New Year's Eve
1967, was shot three times by an
AK-47 rifle and spent three mon-
ths in hospitals in Vietnam and

went lo

Tokyo recovering. He was then
discharged from the Army for
medical reasons after being pro-
moted to Captain, and- awarded
the Bronze Star and Purple Heart.
His hopes of becoming a career
Army officer wiped out, Read em-
barked on a career in law by
entering Washington and Lee's
School of Law. To this day he is
“very grateful” to President
Huntley and the Law School for
allowing “a B to €C student” com-
ing out of an undergraduate pro-
gram not known for its history
department to study at W&L.

Regardless of his background,
Read attained a large amount of
success while at W&L Law School.
He was president of the Student
Law Association, and belonged to
Omicron Delta Kappa as well as
Who's Who.

After graduation, Read practic-
ed private law for several years
and in 1975 was elected to serve as
the Commonwealth's Attorney for
Rockbridge County and the city
of Lexington, a position which he
continues to hold.

One aspect of local government
that most Washington and Lee
students are ignorant of despite
its importance is the Com-
monwealth Attorney’s office.

The current Commonwealth
Attorney, Beverly C. ‘John’
Read has several respon-
sibilities within the local
judiciary system. Read is, in his
own words, “responsible for
prosecuting felony criminal
matters that occur within the ci-
ty of Lexington as well as
Rockbridge County.”

Read is responsible for pro-

secuting any and all misde-
meanor matters which he
deems to be appropriate. The
Commonwealth’s Attorney also
prosecutes serious game viola-
tions and any cases that a vic-
tim of a crime or police officer
asks him to handle.

The most common violation
of law that Washington and Lee
students experience is the
break-in or theft of property.
The Commonwealth Attorney’s
office has an established pro-
cedure that it follows in order to
prosecute in these matters.

Upon being informed by a stu-
dent that there has been a
break-in, the police investigate
the scene of the crime, follow-
ing the standard procedures of
taking fingerprints, making an
inventory of stolen items and
then beginning a general in-
vestigation of the crime. There
are usually few leads as to the
suspect in a crime like this, but
the police and the Com-
monwealth Attorney have
several sources to turn to.

Both parties maintain a list of
possible suspects and they also
maintain contacts with what
Read referred to as ‘‘people of a
Slimey nature’ around Lex-
ington. Over the years Read has
enlisted a group of informants
at what he terms the ‘grass
roots level.’’

After a suspect is discovered,
he is questioned, with arrests
possibly resulting.

Concerning his association
with the university, Read feels
he has a “‘very good relation-
ship” with W&L. He has a
“tremendous amount of
respect” for both the students
and faculty.

He noted, however, that there
are exceptions. He finds a
‘“‘very low percentage’’ of the
students do get involved in
serious incidents that involve
more than drinking or noise
violations. Among these
students, Read is primarily con-
cerned with those that use and
sell narcotics.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Weeknight Parties

With the approach of Fancy Dress midweek par-
ties, we hear new rumblings from the faculty concer-
ning ‘‘legitimacy”’ of such events. The question is
whether or not student organizations (fraternities,
IFC, SAB, SABU, EC) should be ‘‘allowed’”’ to sponsor
midweek parties. Past University Council pro-
nouncements ruled that no such party could take
place; the rationale being that students would suffer
adverse effects (hangover?) from pressure to attend
these parties. The consequences of such a paternal
decree include (1 the new prevalent pitch-in parties
and (2 more frequent road trips to parties sponsored
by surrounding schools. The pitch-in effort is a suc-
cessful evasive measure which going DTR invovles
long travel time — some which is late at night.

While it seems that professors may have genuine
concern of the welfare and academic awareness of
students, it is absurd to think that faculty evaluation
of students’ social lives will improve a students abili-
ty to make his own decisions. Of prime importance is
that W&L purports to be an institution which en-
courages maximum freedom for the student in all his
endeavors. It is a contradiction for this liberal institu-
tion to regulate the otherwise legal social choices of
students. College should not shelter a student from
real world decision making but should urge the
autonomy to make responsible, informed decisions.
As one W&L professor has quoted ‘‘A liberally
educated man is one who knows the consequences of
his actions and the sum total of their relationships.”’
In order to uphold this tenet, a student or his organiza-
tion should have the freedom and option to sponsor
social events whenever they feel it prudent.

In light of the midweek SAB Fancy Dress party, we
are pleased such school-wide events are allowed. Fur-
ther, we abhor any attempt by the faculty to impose
social values upon student organizations. An educa-

tion goes beyond the classroom and includes the total
life experience, especially the cultivation of the
capacity for one to make responsible decisions for

himself.
Hazing

Well, it looks like it’s that time of the year again, all
over campus we See fraternity pledges dressed to the
hilt, answering questions with yes sir, no sir, or main-
taining total silence. Yes, once again it is time for
fraternity initiation — the time when the “‘brothers’’
make pledges into real live actives. And once again,
we feel obligated to warn the pledges that initiation
may not be all that they think it might be. We are
referring, of course, to hazing, a rather unkind prac-

tice.
A few examples from recent history come to mind

and illustrate the types of things pledges should not
have to go through to become active brothers. One

practice is several hours of forced drinking followed
by a physical workout resembling grass drills in foot-
ball and ending with a chewing tobacco swallowing
contest. Another practice is lining pledges up outside
in the snow and freezing temperatures and spraying
them down with a hose. The list goes on but we simply
want to make one point — a pledge will not become a
better brother or person because he has been degrad-
ed through hazing. Hazing is certainly a despicable
practicewhich benefits neither the fraternity involved
nor the pledge who suffers.

Don’t Renounce The Deal

Dear Editor:

I am writing in response to a
letter in last week’s Phi titled
“Renounce the Deal.’’ While I
certainly do not oppose
criticism of Iran for its crude
treatment of our hostages, I
cannot adhere to Mr. Rudder’s
conclusion that Ronald Reagan
should renege on the agreement
which set the hostages free. Mr.
Rudder warns us about the
dangers of establishing a prece-
dent which honors agreements
that have been made with “‘bar-
barians;” however, welching

on the Iranian agreement would
establish an even more
dangerous precedent.

First of all, reneging on any
international agreement would
cause considerable damage to
our national reputation. There
can be no question that what the
Iranians did was wrong;
however, why should we further
aggravate the situation and at
the same time prove to the
world that our word in an inter-
national agreement is not worth
the paper that it is written

upon? Furthermore, our coun-
try was not the only party in the
agreement with Iran; Algeria,
West Germany and England’s
largest bank all played decisive
roles in the release of the
hostages. Reneging on the
agreement would place all of
these countries in a very em-
barassing position.

The reasons not to renege on
the agreement go beyond mere
expedience, however. It is
ironic that such a staunch sup-
porter of Ronald Reagan as Mr.
Rudder would even suggest that
Ronald Reagan welch on the
agreement. Throughout his
campaign Reagan loudly extoll-
ed the virtues of the American
character, Reagan has sought
to re-establish America’s
reputation as a land of honest,
hard-working people. America
the free, America the brave,
America the land of the people
who do not keep their word?
This description simply does
not fit the man’s image, or his
campaign rhetoric. For Reagan
the choice should be simple. It
is between irrational
belligerence and _ national
honor, hypocrisy and personal
| integrity. If Regean decides to
uphold the agreement, America
may be on its way to a ‘“‘new
beginning.” If Reagan re-
nounces the deal, he will have
sacrificed our national honor
simply to make life difficult for
Iran and perhaps be the subject
of another critical work of jour-
nalism. A catchy title soon
comes to mind: The President
Who Failed, Volume Two.

Henry. P. Wall ’81
SAB Co-Chairman Elam

Responds To Student’s Criticism

Dear Editor:

In last week’s letter to the
editor entitled, “‘Student Cites
Mismanagement,’’ the author
stated, “It appears that this
year’s Student Activities Board
is having serious difficulties in
carrying out its awesome
responsibilities — the ad-
ministration of thousands of
dollars of student activity
funds.”” Unfortunately, what
has appeared to Mr. Welch, the
author, was no more than an ap-
parition and more likely a
hallucination.

Claims of mismanagement
against the Student Activities
Board are not only unfounded
but absolutely scurrilous. Mr.
Welch has only used the word

 

‘“‘mismanagement’’ to sensa-
tionalize what he must believe
is a non-sensational complaint.
I find this cheap shot not only
annoying but maddening.
Therefore I will answer his ac-
cusations and lay to rest any
further questions about the
operation of the SAB.

Mr. Welch’s accusation of
mismanagement of student
body funds is a gross mistake.
We have exact records of where
each and every cent was spent
and will be spent.

To be sure that student body
funds are being spent as they
should, the EC checks the ex-
penditures of every student
organization, including the
SAB, every month. Further-
more, these budget reports are
given to the Ring-tum Phi and
are open for examination by
any student, faculty member,
or administrator. As a final
check, Willie Mackie, Student
body Vice President, has com-
puter print-outs of all student
body accounts, including the
SAB’s, to verify all four
records. All of these checks in-
sure the proper management of
student body funds and serve to

prevent any form of
mismanagement.
Having used ‘‘mismanage-

ment” to sensationalize his let-
ter, Mr. Welch reveals his real
complaint, the publicity for
Winter Weekend. While I agree
that publicity for Winter
Weekend was not proper I do
believe it was.adequate.

First off, two weeks ago we
replaced our original publicity
chairman, Quinn Peeper, with
Len Howard. The move was
made to allow enough time for
Quinn to work on Fancy Dress.
The result was this left Len with
very little time to get the
publicity out. Furthermore, the
poster was not finished by the
print shop until Monday. It was
supposed to be ready by the
preceding Thursday.

These major complications,
along with a few more minor
ones kept the publicity from go-
ing up until Monday. Mr. Welch
may not have seen it until Tues-
day, but we can neither afford
the money nor the time to place
posters on every student’s door.

These posters were placed in
obvious locations on Monday.
Although the publicity was not

proper, it was adequate enough
to fill the pavilion.

Finally, Mr. Welch claims
that the SAB can find the tables
used to serve beer during
homecoming ‘right where it
left them — outside on the law
school field to rot all winter.”’ I
would hasten to warn Mr. Welch
to get his facts straight before

making accusations. This
claim, like all other claims in
his letter, is clearly false. The
SAB did not serve beer that
weekend. The party on the law
school field that did serve beer
and probably left the tables
there “‘to rot all winter’ was
sponsored by the EC, ODK and
the SBA. The only connection
the SAB had with the party was
that we loaned them the money
to pay for it.

In the future, I would hope
that Mr. Welch will get his facts
straight before making any ac-
cusations and voice only his
complaints and try not to sensa-
tionalize them. And if he wants
to talk tables, talk to those
responsible for them.

The SAB is a smooth running,
efficient organization. I have
trust and faith in each and
every officer and _ board
member. And I know that they
will do their jobs as they should

Alf Goodykoontz, right, managing editor of the Richmond times-Dispatch, makes a point during a

 

presentation to Washington and Lee University’s chapter of The Society of Professional Jour-
nalists/Sigma Delta Chi. Also pictured are Hampden H. Smith, assistant professor of journalism at
W&L, and Howard Graves, national president of Sigma Delta Chi and Associated Press Bureau Chief in
Portland, Oregon. The presentation was part of swearing in ceremonies for new Sigma Delta Chi of-
ficers at W&L. The new officers are H. Christopher Peacock, president; Douglas R. Linton, vice-

president; and, Timothy J. Crimi, treasurer.

Noise

tions of failing to have a permit.

Nelson Ould, the president of
Sigma Chi, appeared at court
with Sisler. “We talked with
Mr. Sisler about the problem,”’
said Ould, ‘‘and we felt that we
did have a chance to win the
case, so we decided to contest
“

Sigma Chi eventually won
half of its case.

According to Ould, Sisler
pointed out how the noise or-
dinance was ambiguous. Ould,
who was individually charged
with the violation, was not par-
ticipating in the party and had
gone to bed sometime earlier.
Through this loophole, the first

charge was dropped.
Ould continued. ‘In the
future, the president, vice-

president, or the social chair-
man of the fraternity will be
charged as an agent of the cor-

poration.”’

But what is_ particularly
interesting about the case bet-
ween the three houses and the
city is that an amendment to the
ordinance is being attempted
with Sisler’s help.

‘‘One of the conditions that we
had when we hired Mr. Sisler
was that he was to help us get a
better working relationship bet-
ween the Lexington Police
Department and the frater-
nities,”’ said Ould. Ould also
stated that a group of fraternity
members from the IFC are
working up ideas for changing
the ordinance and are to meet
with Sisler to discuss the
options.

“The working relationship
right now is just not feasible
from our side,’’ added Ould.
Ould said he does see the
problem from both sides, that
the fraternities do need some
restriction in order to protect
the townspeople, but that the
times allowed by the permits
are not helpful.

Ould believes that one solu-
tion to the problem is to extend
the noise permit to 1 a.m. and to
allow a weeknight permit. ‘‘All

 

the fraternities could work with
that much easier and I think
that it would help,”’ said Ould.

The major problem, in Ould’s
opinion, is the city’s refusal to
issue noise permits on Wednes-
day nights. “That should be
changed,”’ said Ould. “I guess
you could say that by law, a
group of individuals are not
allowed to have a party on
Wednesday night.”’

Sisler refused to make any
comment about the case, saying
that “‘until the litigation is
finished, having any comments
on the matter in any type of
publication at this time would
not be good.”

When asked whether the
group of fraternity members
had approached him with ideas
for changing the ordinance,
Sisler replied that no one has
come up with alternatives yet,

but that another solution is:

being worked out.

The problem of the noise or-
dinance and noise permits con-
tinues to be a thorn in fraternity
members’ sides. However, an
answer may soon be found to
end the constant misunder-
standings of Lexington’s law.
