Textbook Prices Will Keep Rising,
Many Factors Contribute

by Dave Dallam

By all current indicators, the
prices of textbooks will continue
to rise dramatically, as they
have been doing over the past
three years, according to Betty
Munger, manager of the
Washington and Lee bookstore.
Increased publishing costs have

frequent editions of revised
texts, and the customary offer-
ing of discounts are other major
contributing factors. Unfor-
tunately, the bookstore is not in
a position to ameliorate these
circumstances, since, even
when it buys books sold at net
prices — prices marked down

   

The cost of new textbooks continues to rise.

dustry, which has effectively
passed them on to the student in
the form of steadily increasing
prices.

Inflation is not the sole cause
of price increases; increased
computerization in printing, the

Fraternity leaders met Tues-
day evening in a continued at-
tempt to resolve the problem
posed by Lexington’s noise or-
dinance.

Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent Monty Briscoe suggested
two courses of action: 1) work-
ing to extend the hours which
fraternities are allowed to play
amplified music to 1 a.m. in
return for pledges by fraternity
presidents to adhere more
strictly to the ordinance; 2) con-
test the violations in court.

from the normal retail rate to a
“library rate, which usually
amounts to a 20 percent
decrease — it must resell those
books with a markup of about 30
percent.’ Although such a
percentage increase may seem
unwarranted, Mrs. Munger con-

Sigma Chi President Nelson
Ould said that he has discussed
the matter with Eric Sisler, a
local attorney, who suggested
that if fraternities would
develop a ‘“‘more agreeable
plan” to replace the present ci-
ty ordinance he would present
such a plan to the City Council.

Phi Delta Theta President
Hill McAlister said that he
thought it would be futile to
work with the police to revise
the noise permits. ‘‘We have to
change the law as opposed to
just changing the permit hours,

tends that it barely allows her
operation to break even; it must
pay for staff salaries, accoun-
ting and recording materials,
and shipping of the books
themselves.

Many students have sought
financial refuge from the
phenomenon by buying used
books. According to Slisby M.
Jennelle, National sales
manager for Wallace’s College
Book Company, the youngest
and most rapidly growning
buyer and seller of used college
textbooks in the United States, a
thriving market exists for used
texts. Mr. Jennelle’s company
operates by sending represen-
tatives to campus bookstores
around the country to collect
books of current value — that is,
books which have a great poten-
tial for resale in the broad
market. The representative
gives the student approximate-
ly 25 percent of retail price for
those books which he considers
to be of resale quality:
books which are intact without
extensive markings. The com-
pany then ships the books back
to its warehouse in Lexington,
Kentucky, where they await
reshipment.

Jennelle says that Wallace’s,

the permit is virtually wor-
thless,’’ he said.

Holt Merchant, the IFC’s
faculty advisor, agreed that the
IFC can “‘petition”’ the city coun
cil, but cautioned fraternities
to “be nice to them, be
reasonable, negotiate with
them’’ rather than “‘outrage’’
them as he said former Ex-
ecutive Committee President
Beau Dudley did two years ago.

Merchant suggested that the
IFC enlist the aid of Executive
Committee Representative and
law student Jeff Edwards in the

Law Students Question Bridge Safety

by Tom Baker

Bad lighting on the footbridge
between Doremus Gymnasium
and Wilson Field has students
who use the bridge concerned.

Mike Nogay, the first year
law representative to the Ex-
ecutive Committee, has com-
plained at several EC meetings
that the lighting receptacles on
the footbridge, put in about two
years ago, are spaced too far
apart to do an adequate job of
lighting the bridge. Many law
students, especially women liv-
ing in Baker Dormitory who fre-

quently use the bridge at night,
have told Nogay that the
lighting is unsafe and could in-
vite unfortunate incidents;
although no students have ex-
perienced any serious problems
up to this point.

Bob Willis, EC President, is
looking into the situation and is
going to present these problems
to the administration.

The administration, however,
has already taken steps to cor-
rect the situation. James L. Ar-
thur, the superintendent of

buildings and grounds, explain-
ed that on the night of January
14, he and several other univer-
sity officials toured the campus
to view the lighting system. Mr.
Arthur, Frank Parsons, Assis-
tant to the President, E.
Stewart Epley, the University
Treasurer, and Tom Burrill, the
campus landscaper, took note
of the situation on the foot-
bridge and directed Burrill to
put together a plan correcting
the lighting situation, which he
is in the process of doing now.

private residence since 1970. All
fraternities are required to ob-
tain a permit before moving in-
to any of Lexington’s zoning
districts.

The fraternity was
represented by Washington and
Lee law student Bruce Myers,
who is director of an alumni
organization called New House
Corp. that is assisting the Kap-
pa Sigma chapter. Myers
acknowledged a ‘‘shocking lack
of concern’”’ for neighbors that
typifies fraternities but said
social activities would be close-
ly monitored by local alumni
and a house mother. He said
that local ordinances would be
abided by and that abuse of the
premises would not be
tolerated.

Myers presented five officers
of the new chapter whom he
praised for ‘‘trying to be good
citizens’ and for their involve-
ment in various school ac-
tivities and community ser-
vices. Myers said the students
were at the top of their respec-

tive classes.

A three-year-old honor case
involving a law student at the
University of Virginia was
dropped last week, ending one
of the longest cases in the 139-
year history of the UVa. Honor
+ Committee.

The defendant in the case,
Josh Henson of Falls Church,
Va., had gone through tw»
honor trials and had been ex:
pecting to appear in an un-
precedented third trial this

year. Henson was found guilty
in previous trials.

The incident occured in
September of 1977 when Hen-
son, who was President of the
Association of Student Interna-
tional Law Studies at UVa., was
accused of stealing a moot court
competition problem from the
desk of his organization’s ex-
ecutive secretary.

Henson was accused by
Michael Salovaara, a_ 1980

graduate of the law school.
After the case was dropped,
Henson enrolled in the law
school to complete his gradua-
tion requirements. Henson will
be able to receive a degree as
soon as he completes his course
work, said school officials.

Mike Baughan, chairman of
the Honor Committee, refused
to give anydetails as to why the
case was dismissed. Earlier,
Baughan had received letters

 

from Henson and his accuser.

 

Mock Convention

Receives Gift

The 1984 Mock Convention at
Washington and Lee University
has received a $25,000 gift from
the Hatton W. Summers Foun-
dation of Dallas.

The foundation made a
similar grant to the 1980 W&L
convention.

The W&L event, which is
organized strictly by students,
seeks to predict the Presiden-
tial nominee for the party out of
the White House, well in ad-
vance of the actual national
nominating conventions, With a
record of 12 correct predictions
in 17 attempts, it is historically
the most accurate such affair at
any college, and is also widely

regarded as one of the most
realistic.

The Summers Foundation,
established in 1949, makes gifts
to scholarship endowments and
to higher education institutions
and educational organizations
in general.

Watching the students’ Mock
Republican Convention _ last
May from the VIP balcony, one
of the Summers Foundation
trustees, Judge Charles E. Long
Jr. of Dallas, said: ‘Every
dollar we gave these men has
been seen in the work they’ve
put out. This is really practical
politics — and I love it prac-
tical!’’

EC Examines Whitebook For Revisions

by Bill Whalen

The Executive Committee ap-
pointed a sub-committee for a
possible revision of the
Whitebook at Monday night’s
hour-long session.

Following a move initially
started by Senior Represen-
tative Jim Vines earlier this
year, President Bob Willis
declared that parts of the
Whitebook do not ‘read fluid-
ly,” and should be reviewed by
a committee.

Following Willis’ statement,
the EC broke into disagreement
over the special committee’s
composition. Several members
also questioned this commit-
tee’s role.

“We should set up a commit-
tee to look at general headings
and get wording in the right
place,” said Willis. ‘“‘An over-
view should be taken and some
of the material should be con-
solidated.”’

Willis cited one part of the
Whitebook which deals with the
rights of an accused party in an
honor violation as an example
of sloppy writing. ‘“You will find
a section for the rights of the ac-
cused,” said Willis, ‘“‘and it is
repeated in the procedural sec-
tion.”

EC Vice-President Willy
Mackie furthered Willis’ argu-
ment one step, claiming that -w

urpose of a special committee
should be to examine both the
“stylistic” and ‘substantive’
parts of the Whitebook. The
discussion of the role of such a
committee ended when the EC
debated the actual make-up of
the proposed committee.

Senior Representative Mar-
shall Clark raised two points,
stating that the committee
should consist of people not on
the EC and then concluding that
the committee would only act
according to “their own writing
style and (their opinion of) what
should or should not be in the
Whitebook.”’

Third Year Law Represen-
tative Jeff Edwards jumped in-
to the argument, claiming that
there are enough changes need-
ed to be made in the Whitebook
that “if every person brought
one in, we would be here for two
weeks.”’ The discussion took a
pivotal turn when Jim Vines
questioned if faculty members
would be allowed on the revi-
sions committee.

Mackie argued that faculty
members should not be includ-
ed on the committee, though
they would be allowed to ex-
press their opinions.

Wiilis attempted to clear the
air by stating that the EC
should appoint three of its own
members to decide how the
committee will be made up.

Freshman representative
Ben Hale moved that the EC ap-
point a subcommittee con-
sisting of three EC members
and three students-at-large to
review the Whitebook. The mo-
tion passed, with Vines dissen-
ting because of omission of
faculty members on the propos-
ed committee.

In an effort to include some
form of faculty representatives
on the committee, Willis moved
that the EC also include “‘ad-
ministrators’” on the commit-
tee. The resolution passed, 7-5.

In explaining why he had
earlier voted against the move
to form a revision committee,
Vines first stated his belief that
faculty members should be in-
cluded on the committee, then
asked that his original dissen-
ting vote be changed.

Following the original 10-1
vote to form a committee, Vines
then proposed that the EC add
two faculty members who were
graduated from W&L. This
measure was defeated, but the
“administrator” version pro-
posed by Willis was passed later
in its place.

Prometheus

Killer At Large

My trenchcoat fluttered in the breeze. I was hiding, furtively,

_behind the newspaper. The class bell rang; soon, soon I would fulfill

my contract. I gripped the cold, hard plastic with my right hand. A
tremor seized my body. Yes, it was the distinct feeling of power,
and I held it in my fingertips. Power and I were alone. Power and I
would win.

I had stayed up all night studying my victim’s habits, class
schedule, family life, and high school activities. I knew him as well
as I knew myself. He was an animal; I was the hunter. The blood,
the blood. I craved victory.

I clipped the yellow rubber-tipped dart into the cool, hard, plastic
gun. The click sent a surge of anxiety through my heavy limbs. It
wasn’t a feeling of remorse, just emptiness. I knew my victim so
well I felt I would be killing a part of myself. None of this pathetic
foolishness, though, I thought to myself. I am an assassin. This is no
game; this is KILLER. (Dum de dum dum).

I studied the black and white glossy photograph one last time and
slid the evidence deep into the classified section of the paper. There
he was; an unknowing prep walking closer, closer, closer now. But
he stopped. He stopped and studied the bulletin board. Now is the
time. Now is the time. I walked up and shot him nobly in the back of
the head. ‘“‘Dead. Dead. You’re dead,’’ I shouted. I shouted. I
screamed in triumphant joy. ‘“‘Hand over your assignment; let me
caress the negative.” He did so, benumbed by my stealthy attack.

I walked the Collonade in a euphoric bliss. I had scored. My

yellow, rubber-tipped dart had done its work. I was an assassin.

The blur of success was tantalizing, blinding. Then, dum de dum
dum, I too was hunted. A yellow dart flew by my left ear. A miss. I
turned, ran, aware of my assassin’s pursuit. I heard the click; a
surge of anxiety assailed my heavy limbs. The thump resounded in
my ears, but I had swallowed the photo. No evidence, now. No

 

assassin would beat me.

 

 

Henneman Will Replace Schildt As Assistant Dean At Law School

Edward O. Henneman, assis-
tant- professor of law at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, will become assistant dean
of the School of Law on August
1. The announcement was made -
by Roy L. Steinheimer, dean of
the School of Law.

Henneman succeeds William
Mc. Schildt, who is leaving to
enter private practice in
Hagerstown, Md.

Born in New York City, Hen-
neman is an honors graduate of

Yale University and received
his law degree from Harvard in
1962. He was associated with
two New York law firms as a
specialist in trust and estate
law before coming to
Washington and Lee in 1972 as

associate director of dévelop- .

ment and director of deferred
giving programs.

Henneman became assistant
professor of law in 1978. He cur-
rently teaches courses in trust
and estate and family law.

Schildt leaves W&L after four
years as assistant dean. He
received his B.A. degree with
highest honors’ from
Washington and Lee in 1964 and
graduated from W&L’s School
of Law in 1968

From 1968 to 1972 Schildt was
assistant (later associate) dean
of students and admissions
director. In 1970 he was given
additional duties as coordinator
of the freshman year, then a
new position at the university.

Surprising ‘Popeye’

Shiver Me Timbers,
It’s Not That Bad

by John Wells

Popeye, a Christmas release which opens at the
State Theater on Friday, is a visually humorous,
though often inconsistent film representing a ma-
jor switch on the part of its director, Robert
Altman, and the execution of comic-book based
pictures altogether.

Critics and audiences have not been very kind to
Mr. Altman in the past few years. Although he has

 

Film Review

 

turned out more movies than most of his contem-
poraries since 1975, most of them have either been
very bad or labeled very bad by everybody from
Vincent Canby to Rona Barrett. Big budget pic-
tures with major stars fizzled. Buffalo Bill and the
Indians and Quintet, both with Paul Newman, and
the all-star A Wedding — as well as more modest
productions such as The Perfect Couple.His most
recent project, HEALTH, with Lauren Bacall,
Ruth Gordon and James Garner, is collecting dust
on a shelf somewhere, never released.

Most of the critics have nailed Altman again for
his departure to what must be called musical fan-
tasy, Popeye. I would say the major faults are
these: an occasionally sluggish pace, especially in
some of the musical numbers, and a tendency to
squeeze some gags for all they’re worth. It is so
different it cannot be intelligently compared to
Altman’s major works of the past.

 

The most charming features of Popeye are the
performers and the cartoon-like settings. In fact,
Popeye is nothing more than a living cartoon; all
of the characters are humorously decked out with
distorted big feet and other appendages, and the
locale is a decaying old sea town built in Malta for
20th Century-Fox. It looks like a stack of 1930s
comic books come to life.

The actors handle themselves with thoughtful
control. It would have been a mistake to make the
characters anything but the one-dimensional
figures they are and they or Altman realized this.

As unAmerican as it might sound, I have never
been a Mork and Mindy fan even though |
acknowledge Robin Williams’ unique talents.
Popeye is really no more than a sustained
characterization for him and he, like the rest of
the cast, used the old Paramount cartoon features
for his model. The resulting gruff voice and
distorted demeanor are consistent with
everything else but are drawbacks due to a) sheer
tiresomeness and b) the fact that his lines, spoken
and sung, are often difficult to understand.

Shelly Duvall has worked with few directors
other than Altman since she debuted in his Three
Women several years ago. Her Olive Oy] is skinny
with enormous feet and a whiney, fretful manner
which one associates with the animated cartoon.
About the only difference is her physical inability
to make her arms, legs and neck stretch like rub-

ber (See, POPEYE, page 12)

North by Northwest (1959) Alfred Hitchcock directed this fast-
paced contemporary thriller for M-G-M, casting Cary Grant as the
ordinary guy caught up in a bizarre set of circumstances. It’s ex-
citing and often quite funny, with chills as Grant flees from a killer
crop-dusting plane out west somewhere and, with Eva Marie Saint,
darting about the faces of Mount Rushmore. A lavish production
with pretension apparent only in some of Eva Marie Saiut’s haute
wardrobe (a bustle on one dress, please). Otherwise Hitchcock was
at his entertaining best. With James Mason, Leo G. Carroll and
Josephine Hutchinson. Shown by the Journalism Department on
Tuesday, Feb. 2 at 7 and 9 p.m. in Reid 203. Admission is free.

 

 

NRBQ Slated For Performance in Cockpit

NRBQ (who will perform in
the Cockpit, Wednesday Feb. 4)
has been praised by critics as
one of the most enjoyable, ec-
centric, ‘and unpretentious
bands in America. Many have
tried to label NRBQ and all
have failed. As James Isaacs of
Boston’s The Real Paper notes,
“One cannot categorize the
music of NRBQ except to note
that it thrives on the unexpected
and is consistently superb.”

What does NRBQ stand for?
Born as the New Rhythm ‘N’
Blues Quartet, NRBQ music is a
combination of R&B, Swing,
Rockabilly, and straight-ahead,
down-to-earth Rock ‘N’ Roll.
The members of the group con-
tinue to write new songs in all of
the above styles, blended and
presented with some of the most
arresting and inventive jazz im-
provisation happening today.
NRBQ is indeed all of these
things and much more; it’s
nothing if not eclectic. One
writer summed up the breadth
of an NRBQ set, as follows:

“For diversity of music, it’s
hard to top NRBQ. Besides
original material, their sets in-
clude rockabilly..., jazz..., and
when the mood strikes, the

theme song from ‘I Love
Lucy’!’: The originals of Terry
Adams, bassist Joe Spam-
pinato, and guitarist Al Ander-
son have the same directness
and vitality that characterize
the early, vibrant rock ‘n’ roll of

Buddy Holly and Little
Richard.”
Who comprises NRBQ?

NRBQ is a Quartet with a Plus.
On keyboards and sometimes
lead vocals is the co-originator
of NRBQ. TERRY ADAMS,
also known for his work with the
Carla Bley Band. On lead guitar
and gutsy, driving rock ‘n’ roll
vocals is BIG AL ANDERSON.
At Terry’s right hand is bassist,
another occasional lead singer,
and co-originator of the band
JOEY SPAMPINATO. TOM
ARDOLINO adds the drive and
ever-present beat that rounds
out the Quartet.

NRBQ’s ‘‘Plus’’ is’ the
WHOLE WHEAT HORNS.
DONN ADAMS, Terry’s
brother, is on trombone. While
KEITH SPRING is the band’s
regular on tenor sax, GARY
WINDO of the Carla Bley Band
is also a frequent guest. The
WHOLE WHEAT HORNS work
integrally with the QUARTET

i hh 2
on virtually all arrangements.
Together, NRBQ with the
WHOLE WHEAT HORNS is
creating and performing some

of the most engaging and enter-
taining rock music around to-
day. What’s more, NRBQ is a
group whose individual musi-

 

cians have never lost the joy
and love of playing.

New Rhythm and Blu

(continued from page 4)

A seasoned band with seven
albums, countless singles, and
rave concert, club, and college
dates behind them, it is to
NRBQ’s credit that their No. 1
priority has always been the
sheer artistry and genuine fun
inherent in the music itself. As a
result, NRBQ’s music
transcends styles, categories,
and periods, proving that good
music is truly timeless.

NRBQ is not only fun to listen
to, they’re also a lot of fun to
watch: NRBQ shuns gimmicks,
staging, or artificial effects in
its incredible live perfor-
mances, as in its studio work,
relying only upon the fun, vitali-
ty, and creativity of the group

itself. Always unpredictable in

content but never in quality, no
two NRBQ shows are ever the
same. NRBQ’s_ honest, no-
nonsense approach to the music
business as a business also
comes through loud and clear in
their musical statements, par-
ticularly refreshing at a time
when musical creativity and
complexity are often sacrificed
to the ever-escalating demands
of mass appeal.

Want good music? NRBQ is
your band.

‘tAh, here at last is a band to_
love! The group that calls itself
NRBQ is a glorious throwback |
to no-frills rock-and-roll played |
for the sheer fun of it... NRBQ is |
a refreshing relief from the |
cant, egomania, and pomposity |
of much of rock.”’
Joel Vance |
STEREO REVIEW

‘*..although the performance |
was...rowdy, almost chaotic, it |
was also thoroughly delightful. |
NRBQ came on like a)
neighborhood band from 1963 |
playing in a high-school gym-
nasium under the influence of |
laughing gas.” |

John Rockwell
NEW YORK TIMES

“I love NRBQ...To me, they
embody everything I look for in |
a rock band. They play and sing
well, have a sense of humor,
and write simple, wonderful
songs that I sing in the shower. |
Cliche that it is, this is one band |
that plays for the fun of it...”” |

The preceding was a press
release from NRBQ’s Rounder
Records, and while often this
hype should be dismissed as
hype, in this case almost any
superlative would be _ inade-
quate to describe NRBQ.

I’ve been fortunate enough to
catch the band twice, both
times in Charlottesville. They
have played there several times
at the Mineshaft and were also
featured as the opening for the
Atlanta Rhythm Section (1 hope
it’s no slight to ARS fans that I
left the concert before the main
attraction appeared).

NRBQ is a complete pleasure,
displaying consistently high
quality in musical performance
and humorous content. They’re
equally as good on a large or
small stage, although it’s a real
treat to catch them in a small
bar with a contingent of earnest
fans present (their fans are
nothing if not earnest).

Please go see NRBQ, you’ll be
sorry if you don’t. Jamie Small
and the SAB deserve commen-
dation for the top-drawer
musical entertainment they
have provided this year. — John

Jack Emmer’s Early
Years In Football

NOTE: This is the second in a
series of articles by Sports Editor

Ralph Frasca.

In this week’s look at the
athletic careers of our il-
lustrious denizens of the
Physical Education depart-
ment, I spoke with Jack Em-
mer, who was drafted by the
New York Jets and later played
minor league football before

embarking on a_ coaching
career.
Emmer graduated from

Rutgers University in 1967. He
starred in football and lacrosse.
The professional scouting

* : oe

  

i Fi

system at that time consisted ot
scouting combines, in which in-
dependent scouts evaluated a
player’s talent, -and_ then
reported their findings to any
team who subscribed to the ser-
vice. Scouting combines,
although relatively inexpensive
to the respective teams, were
less personalized than in the
past, prompting one scout to
sigh, ‘‘Combines take all the fun
out of scouting. They eliminate
all personal contact with the
players.”’

Emmer was_ scrutinized
under this system, and thus had
little knowledge of which teams
were interested in him. ‘I
thought I would be drafted by
Dallas, to tell you the truth,”’
said Emmer. ‘‘They were, and
still are a very thorough and
deliberate organization. They
seemed to have their eye on me,
and told me that I would be
drafted in the first six rounds.”’

As it turned out, Emmer was

 

chosen by the Jets in the 13th
round, as a wide receiver.
There were about eight
receivers in the Jets’ training
camp, and three veterans
—Don Maynard, George Sauer,
and Bake Turner — were sure
to make the team. As the Jets
had planned to carry only four
receivers, Emmer faced stiff
competition.

After’ surviving the early
cuts, Emmer’s primary com.
petition proved to be Tomm:
Burnett, a highly touted drat
choice who had been given a no-
cut contract; hence effectively
eliminating Emmer’s chances

é
to make the team.

“I don’t wish to sound bitter,
but I felt that the Jets didn’t
challenge us enough in camp. I
wasn’t given the opportunity to
prove myself in rigorous
physical competition. Also, they
did not take into consideration
the intangibles, the X-factor.”’
They were only concerned with
tangible things like statistics,
not desire, hustle, and other
qualities for which ther are no
stats,” says Emmer.

After being released by the
Jets, Emmer accepted an offer
to teach history and coach foot-
ball at a high school in Levit-
town, New York. Not wishing to
hang up his spikes, he played
for a Jets’ minor league farm
team in Waterbury, Connec-
ticut.

‘After a while, playing ball
proved very inconvenient. The
drive from Levittown to Water-
bury was 100 miles one-way,
and I just couldn’t devote that
much time.”’

  

To rectify the situation, Em-
mer latched on with a New York
Giants farm club in Mount Ver-
non, New York, much closer to
home. He played for the re-
mainder of 1967 and the 1968°
season, and was about to return
in 1969 when he received an of-
fer to coach at Cortland State
University, one of the SUNY
(State University of New York )
schools. After spending three
years at the upstate New York
university, Emmer came to
Washington and Lee in 1972,
where he became head lacrosse
coach and offensive line coach
of the football team. ‘‘I feel that
the facilities and people here at
Washington and Lee have made
this the best working situation
I’ve ever been a part of,’ Em-
mer commented.

In the fall of 1977, Jack Em-
mer was promoted to the posi-
tion of Assistant Athletic Direc-
tor.

“The University of Virginia
was courting me, and they
made a very interesting offer.
However, Bill McHenry enticed
me to stay here by offering me
the promotion.”

Emmer resigned his football
coaching post that year in order
to concentrate on the lacrosse
team.

“‘T think lacrosse can become
a very popular national sport
which eventually attains profes-
sional status, but it needs to be
developed on the high school
level.’’ Emmer_ continued,
‘There are two basic disadvan-
tages to the sport — it doesn’t
have the international appeal
of, say, soccer,and it requires a
player to pay a substantial
amount of money for equip-
ment.”

Jack Emmer, like most of the
coaches at W&L, does not
believe in granting athletic
scholarships to prospective
students who are outstanding
athletes.

“Coach Emmer believes that
when a person goes out for
lacrosse and works hard at it
because he wants to, that in-
dividual will learn responsibili-
ty,”’ said Kevin Walakovits, a
freshman lacrosse candidate.
‘‘We play top-notch scholarship
schools like U.Va. ° and
Maryland, and we’re just as
good as they are, even though
they recruit top players and
havé a much larger school
population. Coach believes that
teamwork and togetherness can
beat any scholarship school.”’

Emmer’s outstanding record
would seem to bear out that
bold statement. He has guided

 

Jack Emmer in 1966 at Rutgers University.

the Generals to the NCAA
playoffs for seven of the past
eight years, as well as ranking
in the top ten amongst Division
I schools nationally seven
times. A stickler for defense,
Emmer has produced an All-
American goalie every year
since his arrival, as well as a
horde of All-Americans at other
positions.

A highly respected coach both
locally and nationally, Emmer
reflected on his earlier years, in
which football had a higher
priority.

‘My high school didn’t have a
lacrosse team, so I was mainly
a football player. I developed a
great interest in lacrosse while
at Rutgers, but by the time I
was an upperclassman, I had
aspirations of playing profes-
sional ball. Since there is no
professional lacrosse league, it
had to be football.

“IT began thinking seriously
about playing pro football when
pro teams started to talk to me
about lucrative contracts,”
Emmer recalls.

Unlike some former athletes,
Emmer does not live in his

nostalgicly

coveting the glow of former
stardom.

“I wouldn’t like to be thought
of as Jack Emmer, the guy who
was drafted by the Jets. That
was only one part of my life.
I’ve retired from the playing ©
aspect of sports, and now I take
pride in my coaching.”” Emmer
went on to say, ‘‘There are
many ex-athletes who just can’t
accept the fact that they are no
longer the players who were
coddled and worshipped by the
public. I think fans associate
professional sports with tinsel
and glamour. They only see an
athlete as a heroic figure on a
gum card. They don’t see that
playing a professional sport is a
grueling, intense job which is
far less glamorous to the

athlete.”’
After his fling with profes-

sional football, Jack Emmer
has progressed to his current
job, which he does well. He does
not particularly care to look
back, but prefers to continually
move ahead, striving to meet
the next challenge.

Next week: Philadelphia Eagles
lineman Boyd Williams.

Indoor

by Rick Swagler

With tonight’s meet in Lyn-
chburg, the Washington and
Lee indoor track team begins
what will be, in the words of
Sports Information Director
Ken Ries, ‘“‘short, intense, an
important”’ season. Coached by
Norris Aldridge and Frank
Miriello, the team will compete
in only four meets this season,
including the ODAC champion-
ship.

Traditionally, indoor track
has been looked upon as merely
preparation for the more exten-
sive outdoor track season this
spring. However, freshman
Lars Keeley holds some very
nontraditional views about in-
door track. Keeley favors in-
door track over both cross coun-
try and outdoor track because
“more strategy is involved.”
He also remarked that there
was a “‘closeness’’ between the
indoor track teammates, which
he didn’t feel existed in cross-

Track Commences Short Season

country.

After cross-country, Keeley
optioned to run — sometimes as
much as fifteen miles per day.
It is this additional training that
Keeley will be counting on when
he runs the half-mile and two
mile races this season.

Vic Jaramillo, a senior ex-
change student from Peru par-
ticipating in his first year of
competitive track, is ‘‘very op-
timistic’’ about the season.
Jaramillo also cites
togetherness as an integral part
of the team’s quest for victory
in the ODAC championship.
Jaranillo has set some very
demanding goals for himself
which reach beyond college. His
ambition is to run for Peru in
the Olympic Games. “In my
country,’’ Jaramillo noted, ‘“‘it
is not very difficult to par-
ticipate in the Olympics.
Because we have so few
talented athletes, the govern-

ment cannot afford to be very

selective about its represen-
tative.”’ :

Indoor track is not solely
composed of runuing events. As
Charlie Alcorn pointed out, shot
put competition is also an event.

. Alcorn, a freshman from Vic-

toria, Texas, placed second in
state shot put competition in his
high school division. When ask-
ed about the reputation of in-
door track as being merely a
‘“‘warmup”’ he commented most
of the meets will be very com-
petitive but that ‘“We may be in
over our heads at the VMI
Relays.’”’ He remarked that
everything is being geared
towards the ODAC champion-
ship.

Alcorn commented that field
coach Miriello was “‘form con-

scious,’ an aspect Alcorn stated
was his weakest. As for the rest
of the team, Alcorn said
freshman Pete Whitehead looks
“pretty good’’ and junior John

McKee, in his first year, should
become proficient after his
form is refined. Alcorn is hav-
ing trouble adjusting to the
longer, plastic shot used in in-
door competition, and this is
causing him to make form
errors.

Keeley, Jaramillo and Alcorn
were highly critical of the W&L
facilities. Charlie Alcorn ques-
tioned the reasoning behind not
installing facilities such as
those found at VMI when
Warner Center was built. In
reply to this dissatisfaction,
Aldridge replied that he ‘‘didn’t
want to get into that.’’ He went
on to say that W&L is fortunate
to have high quality facilities
nearby. Aldridge expects the

ODAC championship to be held
at VMI next year, which should
give W&L a slight edge, he said.

Although the team is missing
R. J. Scaggs due to his committ-
ments to the basketball team,

and Billy Morris due to
pneumonia, Aldridge says that
team morale should remain
high, although Morris’ and
Scaggs’ talents will be missed.

When asked of the team’s
weaknesses, Aldridge cited the
jumping events — long jump,
high jump, pole vault, and triple
jumps — as problem areas, due
to a lack of depth. The team’s
strong points are Todd Howe
and Parker Schenecker in
hurdles, the Kadesky brothers
— Keith and Kevin — in sprints;
Russ Rector in the high jump;
and Alan Anouritage in the high
and triple jumps.

After only two and one-half
weeks of practice and problems
with the flu, the team travels to
Lynchburg tonight to begin its
season. Aldridge expects the
team to do fairly well, but
refuses to speculate on the ef-
fect of having the ODAC cham-
pionship meet and Fancy Dress
on the same weekend.

Generals Lose Invitational, Beat Hornets

by John Harrison

Inexperience, unrest
resulting from differences in
philosophy, injuries, and some
bad breaks have made it a
frustrating and disappointing
season for the W&L wrestling
team. The fact that the
Generals have posted only two
victories to date indicates a
marked decline from their suc-
cess in the past three seasons.

The Generals have won three
of the previous four ODAC
championships and were
runners-up last season, even
though they entered the event
with a lowly 3-8 record. This
season there is no conference
championship to look toward
once the regular season is over.

With five meets left and the
chance to finish the season with
a winning mark no longer possi-
ble, the Generals must look
within themselves to find the

necessary motivation to com-
plete the schedule. This is not to
suggest that coach Gary
Franke is incapable of main-
taining team spirit, for he has
certainly proven otherwise.

However, it looks like the
Generals will, from here on in,
be competing solely for pride, to
prove something to themselves.

There was some good news
for the Generals last week.
Elbert Umila, who left the team
less than three weeks ago, has
decided to return. His victory in
last Wednesday’s meet against
Lynchburg helped W&L defeat
the Hornets, 31-22. “Elbert
thought he may have acted
hastily when he quit. He decid-
ed afterwards that he still
wanted to be a part of the
team,’’ Franke explained.

The Generals were not as for-
tunate the following night, drop-
ping a 32-24 decision to the
University of Richmond. Team
captain Dave Stoeffel (167) and
freshman Tim Valliere (158)
posted wins in both the Lyn-
chburg and Richmond meets.

Saturday’s W&L Invitational
was dominated by the North
Carolina entries. Paced by Jay
Garish (150) and J.T. Hearst
(167), the Catawba Indians suc-
cessfully defended their title.

‘Sale Items Include:

They rolled up 571% points to
edge Elon, which finished with
54\%. Pfeiffer was third with 49,
and Davidson placed fourth
with 47 as the schools from the
Tarheel State swept the top four
spots. Elon’s Jay Lineberry, the
126-pound champion, was voted
the Invitational’s outstanding
wrestler.

Rounding out the scoring
were Hampden-Sydney and
Lynchburg, both of whom tied
for fifth place with 45 points.
W&L tallied 37, and Longwood,
which suited up only five
wrestlers, scored 11.

Tim Valliere was W&L’s lone
representative in the finals. His
attempt to come from behind

against Lynchburg’s Steve
Massengill fell agonizingly
short, 5-4.

W&L emerged with only one
injury, but it proved to be a
crucial blow to the Generals.
Senior Jim Forte, who wrestles
in the 190-pound weight class,
bruised some ribs in his match
and is lost for the season. Coach
Franke plans to move Dave
Stoeffel into Forte’s class. This
will create a vacancy at 167.

Kroll Quits, Replacement Sought

by Phil Murray

Chuck Kroll has resigned as
baseball coach at Washington

before the season starts.

opportunity to coach here, and
I've learned a lot,” said Kroll
earlier this week.

Kroll came to W&L in the fall
of 1978 as an assistant football
coach and was named head

Generals Get Bounced By

by Dale Park

Just as things appeared to be
going right for the Washington
& Lee varsity basketball team,
the situation took two turns for
the worse last night in the
Generals’ 80-70 loss to Eastern
Mennonite COllege at Warner
Center.

One bad turn was the loss
itself, only W&L’s second loss at
home all season, but their se-
cond straight loss to an ODAC
rival. The Generals watched
their ODAC record slip to 4-3.

The other bad news was the
shoulder injury to playmaker
George Spears, the team’s

On January 22, the
Washington & Lee varsity
basketball team dropped a
disappointing 87-79 decision to
Lynchburg College at Lyn-
chburg.

The loss lowered the
Generals’ ODAC record to 4-2
and brought their overall mark
to 12-4.

Against Lynchburg, W&L’s
previously red-hot shooting
cooled to a frigid 40 percent
from the field. All five General
starters managed double figure
scoring performances, yet only
two shot 50 percent or better as
W&L watched a 38-36 halftime
lead slip away.

“Obviously, it is going to be a
rough game when you miss
layups and dunks,” continued
Canfield. ‘‘We just played dumb
basketball — we lacked leader-
ship but we've got to keep work-
ing.”

Senior co-captain Carby Hoy
led his team with 15 points and
grabbed seven rebounds.
Classmate Rob Smitherman, at
center, followed closely with 13
points and seven rebounds,
while forwards Brian Hanson
and Clark New chipped in 12
and 11 points, respectively.

The Generals’ next game will
be Sat., Jan.31, when W&L hosts
Maryville College. Gametime is
8 p.m. at Warner Center.

 

Mennonite, 80-70

Senior co-captain Carby Hoy
hit 8 of 16 shots to lead the team
with 19 points. Brian Hanson
scored 16 points on 8-for-15

shooting, and grabbed 15 re-
bounds.

The three remaining starters,
junior guard George Spears,
junior forward Clark New and
senior center Rob Smitherman,
shot a combined 13 for 40 on the
night. Spears finished with 15
points, while New and Smither-
man contributed 12 and 10
points respectively.

Smitherman, like Hanson,
iad a big night on the boards,
dulling down 15 rebounds.

Swimmers Beat Sheperd, Even Record

The Washington and Lee
swim team moved a step closer
to its dream of a winning record
when it defeated Shepherd Col-
lege 57-48 this past Saturday,
Jan. 24, in W&L’s Cy Twombly
Pool. The Generals, who im-
proved their record to 3-3, will
strive to push above the .500
mark this Saturday, Jan. 31
when they travel to face
William & Mary.

‘“‘We said before the season
that we’d like to get the winning
record. At this point, with five
dual meets left, it looks like
we'll be one win over .500 or one
win under, and we’re not think-
ing about one under,’’ reports

head coach Page Remillard.

In the win over Shepherd,

offered. ‘‘We went without our
diver, who was ill, so Shepherd
got 10 points there. And we ran
our relays unofficially to let our

events, so Shepherd got 14 more
points. Our swimmers came

As CIA Is Weakened,

kp

alias,

 

by Jack Sharman
The Central Intelligence Agency was one of the
primary victims of the post-Watergate fallout (or
foolishness). If one ponders at length and with
energy, one can indeed remember the CIA. Sure,
sure, the guys in the coats. Intelligence,

kaboodle. Due to the revelation of its excesses of
the past, some of which did not, the ef-
ficaciousness of the Agency ‘vas reduced to the
point at which the only piece of information it
could retrieve from Moscow or Peking or Havana
was the price for digital stimulation administered
by streetwalkers in those metropolises.

Stansfield Turner, the present Director, has
demonstrated approximately the same com-
petence as that of the President under whom he
has served. Yet, quake not. President Reagan’s
designate for Director, William Casey, will do
much to raise the status of the organization and
once again instill motivation in its members.
Casey served in the OSS during World War II, and
he is a capable administrator, evidenced by the
fact of his successful management of President
Reagan’s campaign. One does not envision Casey
dismissing veteran agency administrators out of
hand, as Turner did, simply because Idaho’s
disco-era version of Romain Roilard, Senator
Frank Church, has apparently endorsed Mitchum

anti-perspirant and thereby evinces no concern
that the KGB might be doing something besides
holding church bazaars.

There is no question that we are behind the
Soviets in the area of intelligence gathering, a
position endangered by negligible public,
legislative, and executive support, by vitriolic or
irresponsible attacks by the press and various her-
bal individuals such as Phillip Agee, and by a
number of laws that allow almost anyone, should
he be sufficiently diligent, to find out what is going
on in the CIA. Two new bills are being considered
by Congress which, if passed, may rectify the
situation somewhat.

The first would simply exempt the CIA from the
strictures of the Freedom of Information Act. The
Act does, of course, have some notable qualities,
but not when it is applied to the CIA. The Agency is
not the junior league: it must function in extensive
if perhaps not complete secrecy, or it will not func-
tion at all. Making accessible to the public most
anything written down on paper within the CIA is
‘not a drive for above-board governance of the
Agency, it is an exercise in foolishness.

The second bill would make it a criminal offense
for any CIA employee, past or present, to make
public the names of CIA officials. Such a law
would do much to nullify the noxious activities of
individuals such as Agee to whom, one might
argue, could be applied the term ‘“‘traitor”’ in both
its moral and legal senses. Although the penalty
need not be as severe as that for treason — albeit
the case could be made that the transgressions the
bill defines are treasonable — the penalty should
be stiff enough to effectively inhibit the violator
from having a chance to commit the same act
again within the generation.

With these two bills, and a renewed, favorable
interest in the CIA on the parts of the public and
the President, we may yet be able to gather in-
telligence other than the votes of a Muscovite
bordello.

when reselling them, thus pric-
ing them at 50 percent of
original retail value. When the
Washington and Lee Bookstore
receives them, it in turn marks
them up another 25 percent. The
student thus pays 75 percent of
the total original retail value
when buying a used book.

But could independent selling
— the sale of books among
students themselves — serve as
a viable alternative ? Both
seller and buyer might stand to
profit in this situation, since the
seller could sell his books at a
price greater than that which he
would receive from the used
textbook company buy at the
same time less that that which
the student would have to pay at
the bookstore. It is practiced
among some students, but the
buying back of books by the
bookstore at the end of each
year tends to siphon off poten-
tial dealers in the direct-sell

market.
No viable solution to textbook
prices seems imminent;

students simply have to absorb
increased prices and increased
prices along with increased tui-
tion as a function of general in-
flation in the economy.

Year in and year out one of the dullest and least
noticeable events of the Washington and Lee campus
is the process on White Book changes. Sure, with Fan-
cy Dress around the corner and the Spring semester
not too far behind, it is hard to get excited over what
appear to be obscure semantic changes in a book that
most of us read only once, if ever at all. Yet now,
more than ever, these changes could be critical to the
honor system — possibly determining whether the
system retains the strength to remain intact or if it
will be forced into a change. Honor Systems around
the country have crumbled or wilted in recent years,
and while some still exist on paper they are virtually’
ineffective.

The Honor System at Washington and Lee is still
strong and remains one of the outstanding aspects of
this university. But nationally students are taking
honor cases to the courts and winning judgements
which either grant the defendent a new trial or place
him back into the school. If the Executive Committee
can find a way or ways to improve the system, we
urge it to do so. We know the EC has the university’s
best interests at heart, yet we urge that the White
Book changes be more extensive and handled dif-
ferently than proposed Monday night. Two ideas
which spring to mind are utilization of faculty
members in addition to the administration and input
from law students who have been involved in counsel-
ing students accused of violations. The faculty, legal
representatives from the law school and the Ex-
ecutive Committee all become familiar with the
system and White Book; it only seems natural that
the changes should include full participation by those:
who get involved.

Graduate Rebuts Johnson’s Comments

Dear Editor:

I have just read Ed Johnson’s
evaluation of W&L. I found
most of his remarks offensive at
best, and those regarding
research opportunities at the
university fallacious as well. I
was a Robert E. Lee Research
Scholar, albeit under. the
auspices of the Chemistry
Department, and found the ex-
perience educational and the
faculty both cooperative and en-
thusiastic. I do not imagine the
faculty in the Physics Depart-
mentwould go out of its way to
close the frontiers of research
to someone as talented as Mr.
Johnson. Even his talents must
have limits, however, as the

ability to transfer to a more ac-
ceptable campus seems to be
beyond his realm of ac-
complishment.

Then there is that lather of
lust that Mr. Johnson claims to
work himself into by the end of
the week. Strange, in my years
at W&L, the fact that women
were for weekends only was
never pointed out to me.
Thanks, Mr. Johnson, I'll
remember that!

I must however agree with
our proud scholar that the
Naval Academy would have
been a better choice for his
education. What, with all those
midshipwomen around for
close-order drills, he would

have never been lonely during
the week. As for his desire to
pursue his training in physics,
Annapolis would have been
perfect. The last physicist from
the Naval Academy that pops
into my mind is...let me
see...Jimmy Carter! The Navy
has its good points, however.
Mr. Johnson would have gotten
some drills in good taste along
with maneuvers in tact. He
could use them both.

So, congratulations on your
scholarship, Mr. Johnson, and
God save the Queen.

Sincerely,
William R. Schooley ’78

‘Renounce The Deal’

Dear Editor:

I am writing this letter for the
purposes of supporting the
views expressed in the Wall
Street Journal of January 21,
1981 and to inform others of
these views. The editorial was
titled “‘Renounce the Deal’’ and
its first sentence was: “The
agreement the United States
made with Iran for return of the
hostages has the same moral
standing as an agreement made
with a kidnapper, that is to say
none at all.’’ The editorial goes
on: ‘“‘This was not an agree-
ment, it was extortion. And it is
important for the world to know
that extortionists are not entitl-
ed to the same legal and moral
consideration as governments
operating in accordance with
international law.”

I strongly agree with these
views. I feel that the new ad-
ministration of the United
States is under no obligation
whatsoever to submit to the
terms of an agreement
negotiated with the Iranian bar-
barians. Indeed, the Iranian’s
treatment of the former
hostages graphically illustrates
their savagery. The 52
Americans suffered extremely
poor diets (often including wor-
my powdered milk), long
periods of solitary confinement,
beatings, fake executions,
games of Russian roulette and
being told of a parent’s death.
In this last instance, the
Iranians offered to free this
hostage in exchange for secret

information. To honor an agree-

ment in light of this and other
information is unthinkable and
sets an extremely dangerous
precedent. President Reagan

should not hesitate to renege on —

any part of the agreement made
with these brutal criminals. The
Wall Street Journal article ends
with this sentence: ‘‘We should
not hesitate to make it clear
that an agreement negotiated
under such conditions is wor-
thless and equally clear that
anyone who attempts the same
thing in the future will not be
treated so gently.”

I would also like to state my
belief that Jimmy Carter has
been given far too much credit
for the release of the hostages
(if indeed the word credit can

be ‘used under these cir- |

APRIL ‘81

NICAT

   

Prepare For:

cumstances). It was clearly the
Iranians’ perception of Presi-
dent Reagan as a strong and ef-
fective world leader that played
an extremely large role in the
release. Of course, former
Carter officials are partially
right when they attribute the
release to the economic sanc-
tions against Iran and the need
for U.S. arms in their war, but

this was still very gentle treat-
ment, as the Wall Street Journal
article indicates. The timing of
the release undoubtedly _in-
dicates the Iranians’ perception
of President Reagan as a man
of action and an aggressive
leader, and President Reagan
should be given a great deal

more credit

‘Killer Game’ Organizer Feels Distressed

Dear Editor:

I find it distressing that the
editorial staff has such a dearth
of material to choose from as to
resort to picking on the Killer
game. In a week which was
highlighted by two of the most
important events in recent
years, you chose to malign an
entertaining game which has
been enjoyed by literally
thousands of students all over
the country.

You suggest that I didn’t give

~ the Honor System the respect it

deserves. If you had bothered to
ask anyone on the Executive
Committee, you would have
discovered that I called Bob
Willis on my own initiative
before the E.C.’s last meeting.
We discussed the poster issue at
length. I explained that the
Honor System was included on’
the posters only to stress to par-
ticipants the importance of be-
ing honest between one another.
Bob clearly understood my in-
tentions and promised to fur-
ther these at the upcoming E.C.
meeting. I also told him that
you were considering having an
article written about the killer
game in last week’s paper
(which you did not do). I had
hoped that my intentions would
have been included in this arti-
cle.

So you ask for respect? I feel
as if I did my share. Now let’s
talk about you. Not only did you
do your best to destroy this
game in its most important
week of promotion, but you used
the Phi Delta Theta house as a
convenient tool to further
deceive the student body by
allowing that horrendous car-

     

toon to be published. You knew
damn well that the killer game
was.a private enterprise and
had nothing to do with the Phi
Delt house at all. To suggest
that the Phi Delts are shady and
dishonorable is inexcusable.
Not only is such ‘treatment
highly unprofessional, but I

 

would venture to say that it is
dishonorable on your part. An
apology to the Phi Delt house is
in order. I ask you then, is that
the kind of respect to which you
were referring? .

I am sorry that you are either
too busy or too above the game
to participate next week. For

Drennen

I attended the Jan. 19 EC meeting, at which time
Bob Willis referred to Mr. Drennen and the Killer
Game. In its discussion, however, the EC referred to
the game as “‘the Phi Delt Game.” Unfortunately, I
received the wrong impression as to who was organiz-
ing the game. I therefore apologize to the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity for any embarrassment caused to it.
Our editorial opinion concerning the Killer Game re-

mains unchanged.

Bill Whalen

those of us who will be playing, |
it will definitely be a nice break |

hours here at W&L. |

explain myself. |

Richard Drennen |

Phi Delt
Offended

Dear Editor:

As a member of Phi Delta
Theta Fraternity, I must take
offense at your misrepresenta-
tion of the ‘‘Killer’’ game adver-
tized about campus. The game
was not, as reported by Bill
Whalen, “‘organized by the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity for the
purpose of raising money.’’ The
game was organized by in-
dividuals, albeit Phi Delts, for
their own gain. Todd Smith’s
drawing, likewise, portrays a
gang of Phi Delts in the process
of subverting Robert E. Lee and
his Honor Code. While Smith’s
sketch is no doubt clever, it is
wholly inaccurate and irrespon-
sible to depict an entire
Organization in such a
derogatory light.

I resent being slighted for an
activity with which I have no
connection. I feel certain the
respective fraternities to which
the editors belong would not
care to be held responsible for
the reputation of the 1980-1
Ring-tum Phi.

Kappa Sigma Denied Special Use Permit

(continued from page 1)

James E. Gianinny of 523 S.
Main St. presented a petition
signed by 29 neighbors opposing
the Kappa Sigma move. Gianin-
ny said six families near the
house have children and that
this group felt the fraternity
would adversely affect the
neighborhood due to loud noise
and parking problems.

Myers responded by saying
that two points should be con-
sidered by the neighbors: 1) the
new fraternity members have
“decisively different attitudes”’
from students who occupied the
house in the late 1960s and 2) the
new house would be strictly
supervised.

The most vocal opposition to ,

the move came from those
neighbors who remember what

the area was like in the 1960s.

A. A. Adams III of 6 Edmond-
son Ave. recalled footballs
thrown through his windows,
beer cans tossed on his porch,
stereos playing full blast and
furniture and beer’ kegs
decorating the front yard of the
house. “I feel like the same
thing will happen again,” he
said.

Popeye — _

(continued from page 4)
un roller skates, ladders, eic. She manages to pull
it off rather well, and one of her songs, in which
she justifies her imminent marriage to Bluto, is
the best musical sequence the film offers.

Other highlights: Paul L. Smith as a panting,
bear-like Bluto, Ray Walston, who acts beautifully
without appearing to act as Popeye’s pap (he may
be forgiven for his token song), and an extraor-
dinarilly expressive child actor who plays the in-
fant Swee’pea. The part of Wimpy, played by Paul
Dooley, deserves better.

The photography is straight, nothing flashy, but
very bright and colorful and enhances some of the
bizarre costumes nicely. The blues, reds and
yellows are like brilliant reproductions of the old
comic books and animated cartoons. But it’s all
very relaxing and during the slow parts actually
sleep conducive depending upon one’s physical

of the unrealistic atmosphere the story affords.
There was an awful movie a year or so ago with
Kirk Douglas called The Villain (now seen
sporadically on HBO) which attempted to act out
what appeared to be scenes from old Roadrunner
cartoons, with Douglas as a human coyote.
Popeye is more successful because it takes
familiar cartoon situations that are physically im-
possible and makes them funnier than the
original. An example is one of the best scenes,
where Popeye punches out a no-good, swiftly
knocking his head back and forth like a punching
bag.

A little tighter editing may have made
Popeye better. Although it takes a while to get
there, the ending is well-executed. I was frankly
surprised that the whole thing was as good as it
was and am pleased to read in Variety that it is
beginning to earn back a portion of its $20-million

St. complained of past noise and
parking and violations ‘“‘when
they had a house mother”’ and

said that calling the police was ~

a. waste of time. “I’ve lived
there from 1960 to 1970 with the
fraternity and from 1970 to 1980
without it, and I prefer to live
without it,”’ she said.

Claude B. Colonna of 606 S.
Main St. said that the Planning
Commission had denied a 1972
request by an antique dealer to
move into the same address. He
said a new fraternity would
lower property value in the
neighborhood and urged the
commission to consider the
facts and to be “consistent in
every phase.”

Scattered support for the
special use permit came from
alumni and a few others who do
not live near the proposed loca-
tion. W. Gordon Saunders of 104
‘Colston St. said that the 16-
room, six bathroom dwelling is
ideally situated for a fraternity
house. Saunders did not give his

address until pressed by
Planning Commission Chair-
man Harry L. Ravenhorst.

When discussion was com-
pleted, City Manager John V.
Doane said that the overwhelm-
ing opposition to the permit
came from those directly af-
fected by it and moved that the
application be denied. The mo-
tion was passed unanimously
and was met with applause.

New House Corp. now has the
option to submit an application
for the special use permit to
Lexington City Council, where
approval seems unlikely.

“*T thought the handling of the
situation by the planning com-
mission was fair,” said Scott
Dacus, Kappa Sigma president,
earlier this week. ‘‘It seemed
concrete against us at the hear-
ing. I felt ‘that the decision
reflected the display of opposi-
tion that afternoon.”

‘‘We’re considering options,’
said Dacus. ‘‘We’re just going
to have to start over.”’
