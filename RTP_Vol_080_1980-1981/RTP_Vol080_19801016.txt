Election Rules Finalized

by Cope Moyers

With one week left before
freshmen and first-year law
student elections, the Executive
Committee and Voting Regula-
tions Board Monday night
finalized rules governing the
election.

Candidates are permitted to
spend a maximum of $10 on
their campaigns, can place 15
posters in selected areas
around campus and must
remove posters within a week
after the election, according to
rules approved by both commit-
tees.

The election will be held Mon-
day with a run-off Thursday if
no candidate receives a simple
majority of ballots cast. Can-
didates are running for posi-
tions on the Executive Commit-
tee, freshman president, vice-
president and university coun-
cil.

“‘We have to have a fair and
equal election,”’ Voting Regula-
tions Board co-chairman Mike
Drinkwater told the candidates
present at the meeting.

“If you have any questions,
ask me before you do it,”’ he ad-
ded.

Renovation Announced
After Newcomb Inspection

A $300,000 project to remodel
Newcomb Hall, Washington and
Lee University’s 96-year-old
former commerce building at
the south end of the Colonnade,
will begin almost immediately
to provide a new home with
substantially improved
facilities for four under-
graduate departments in the
humanities.

Offices in remodeled New-
comb for 22 faculty members in
history, sociology, philosophy
and religion will be ready as
early as mid-April. Work on
classrooms and seminar rooms
in the building will be com-
pleted over the summer, and
Newcomb will be in full use by
the beginning of classes in
September 1981.

The project will be under-
taken primarily by Washington
and Lee’s own Buildings and
Grounds Department, with out-
side subcontractors brought in

The candidates are also per-
mitted one banner that is not in-
cluded in the $10 limit. Posters
can only be placed in Evans
Dining Hall and the freshman
quad. Law students are permit-
ted to place their posters in the
dining hall and at the law
school. No posters are allowed
in the University Center.

EC member Jeff Edwards
made a motion that voters rank
each candidate on the ballot in
order of preference. Under Ed-
wards’ plan, voters would rank
each candidate according to his

(See ELECTION, page 2)

as the work requires.

The Newcomb remodeling
program will be similar to that
undertaken in Tucker Hall at
the North end of the Colonnade
to provide office and classroom
facilities for W&L’s foreign-
language departments.

The office and classroom
areas of Newcomb will be re-
partitioned to meet the needs of
the four departments. Acoustics
will be improved, and electrical
and plumbing fixtures will be
upgraded, although those basic

systems are in good shape, ac-
cording to the firm of Harris,
Norman, Giles & Walker, the
university’s structural
engineers.

That engineering study also
determined that Newcomb is in
good structural condition —
although the remodeling pro-
ject will also include cosmetic
repairs to the facade of the
building.

fessor of engineering and

Noise Violations

Outrage IFC

by Mike Perry

The Interfraternity Council
met last Tuesday night to
discuss recommendations
made in a report by the Ad Hoc
Committee on Fraternities, but
discussion abruptly shifted to
law enforcement in Lexington,
specifically the city’s noise or-
dinance.

“We need to know exactly
what constitutes a noise viola-
tion,’ Sigma Alpha Epsilon
representative Mason Ellerbe
said. Many fraternity represen-
tatives complained that the
police have been inconsistent in
their enforcement of the city’s
noise ordinance. A Zeta Beta
Tau representative charged
that the police issued his house
a summons and “gave no warn-
ing at all, but some houses get
warned.”

IFC President Monty Briscoe

added that the “police shift
back and forth’’ on the question.
Kappa Alpha President John
Northington suggested that it
was time the “IFC stood up and
did something”’ such as retain a
lawyer to contest noise or-
dinance summonses issued to
fraternity houses. Northington
also questioned the IFC’s policy
of automatically placing houses
convicted of a noise violation on
social probation for two weeks
as “just going along with the
police” with regard to the mat-
ter.

Briscoe was not sure whether
or not the policy was contained
in the IFC by-laws, but explain-
ed that the social probation
punishment was adapted in an-
ticrpation of rulings by the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee in such
cases. Briscoe added there are

Alcohol And Alcoholism At W&L

Dr. Worth sees the reason for alcohol

—~

Kegs — down the road. Hawaiian
party-rum punch. Tired of beer? Come to
a mixed drink party. Kegs, kegs, kegs.
More kegs.

GRAIN.

Variations on a theme. The style and
setting change — fill in your own frat,
etc. — but the main attraction on the
marquee is alcohol. At Washington and
Lee University, fraternity or
undergraduate social functions regularly
— inherently — _ include liquid
refreshments of an alcoholic nature. And
lat W&L, grain alcohol reigns supreme. A

 

But W&L students can’t be singled out
in their penchant for drink. A Time
survey of several New England cam-
puses a year ago revealed that 95 percent
of all undergrads were at least ‘‘occa-
sional drinkers.’”’ Twenty-nine percent
said they regularly consumed a six-pack
of beer or five shots of liquor at a sitting
—‘“heavy drinkers.’’ Time called the
escalating use of alcohol ‘‘the single
greatest drug abuse on any campus,” a
nationwide problem of proportions like
never before, and a problem which is
particularly prevalant among college

All true, says Dr. James Weldon Wor-
th, the counselling psychologist at
Washington and Lee, perhaps to an even
greater extent here in Lexington.

“W&L has a reputation as a hard-
drinking campus,’ Dr. Worth em-
phatically points out. “Drinking is
presented as a way to be accepted.
Freshmen get the message that to be
cool, you have to do a lot of drinking
—right from the word go.”’ (The Time
statistics show a higher percentage of
drinkers among freshmen than up-
perclassmen. )

abuse as two-fold, rooted in W&L’s “‘very
competetive atmosphere of academic
and social tension —a convenient way to
blow off bad vibes.”

In the academic realm he says, ‘‘Lots
of anger is generated by not doing as well
as one thinks he should be doing, and the
student drives for critical reasons, for
reasons of depression.”

Socially, students find themselves
under pressure as well. ‘To jump in a
car and go down the road to a mixer can

be scary,’’ he believes. “Trying to get 7

Outing Club Plans Activities

by Chris Peacock

The Washington and Lee
Outing Club has come about this
year in an attempt to meet the
interests of an increasingly
diversified student body, as
well as to take advantage of the
excellent terrain in the areas
surrounding Lexington.

Included in the university
budget this year is $2,500 to
meet the initial expenses of the
new organization. Dean H.
Robert Huntley, program direc-
tor of the club, used the money
to purchase backpacks, tents,
cooking sets, climbing ropes,
and other equipment to be used
in the club’s activities. Also, the
Student Activities Board voted
last spring to give its four
canoes to the club, a decision
for which Dean Huntley is
“very grateful.”’

Dean Huntley stressed that
the Outing Club is no new idea,
pointing out that Professors
Charles Boggs, John McDaniel
and William Pusey ‘‘laid the:
groundwork for such ant
organization some years ago.”’
However, they did not obtain
university funding and their
plans did not work out.

The club has’ scheduled

several activities for the re-
mainder of the term, including
backpacking, canoeing and cav-
ing. Most of these plus a

Christmas party are in conjunc-
tion with similar  organiza-
tions from Hollins and Sweet
Briar Colleges. Groups from
Mary Baldwin and Randolph-

preference with one being the
first choice.

“Under this system, voters
can pick their first choice plus
their run-off preference,’ Ed-
wards said.

“It’s pointless to start-off an
election knowing there’s going
to be two elections,’’. Edwards
added.

After a short discussion, the
committee rejected Edwards’

motion.

“Half the time they (the
students) don’t even know most
of the candidates, so voters
really couldn’t rank their

. preferences,’ EC member.

Marshall Clark said.

In other business, the com-
mittee heard monthly activity
reports from the Student Bar
Association, Mock Convention,
Calyx and Ariel.

Mock Convention spent $12.14
in September while the Student
Bar Association spent $4981.61
last month.

The Executive Committee ex-
pressed its displeasure that
both Ariel and Contact had fail-
ed to report properly to the EC.
A motion was passed requiring
both committees to revort back
to the EC at the next meeting.

Macon Woman’s Colleges will
join the W&L club for activities
later in the year.

-The Outing Club has approx-
imately 35 active members,
almost all of whom are up-
perclassmen. However, it is
open to law students and
members of the faculty and
staff as well as_ to
undergraduates. Dean Huntley
found it surprising that most of
the members are in fraternities
(excluding freshmen), because
one of the reasons for founding
the organization was, according
to ‘‘Outing Program Proposal,”
“the University’s increasing
concern for the social life of its
independent students.’’
However, he was quick to add
that he does not want the
organization to be considered
an alternative to either indepen-
dent or fraternity life.

Emphasizing that the group’s
activities are expanding more
quickly then he had anticipated,
Dean Huntley likened the pro-
gram to a great primeval atom
exploding into numerous ac-
tivities. Plans call for the club
to be subdivided into six clubs;
backpacking, bicycling, canoe- -

ing, climbing, rafting and ski-
ing. However, members of each
subgroup would be allowed and
encouraged to participate in the
activities of the other groups,
according to the proposal.

Dean Huntley has_ en-
countered problems in arrang-
ing transportation for the
Outing Club. “Originally we
had been led to hope for some
help from one or another of the
vans allocated to the Athletic
Department, thinking that they
had been intended for universi-
ty use.

“‘As Coach Dick Miller phras-
ed it, ‘It would set a bad prece-
dent if we made a van available
to just any university-sponsored
organization which needs it.’

“Fortunately the students
themselves have come to the
aid of the Outing Club,
volunteering their own cars
when university vans have sat
unused in the parking lot. The
particular occasion I have in
mind was on a Sunday morn-
ing.”

A bulletin board further
detailing the Outing Club’s ac-
tivities is on the Colonnade
across from Payne Hall.

New Art Exhibit Features Aquatints

An exhibit of aquatint pain-
tings by the Spanish artist
Francisco Goya opened this
week in duPont Gallery at
Washington & Lee University.
It is on loan to W&L from the
Virginia Museum of Fine Arts
and will remain on view
through Oct. 31.

The exhibit, entitled ‘‘Los
Caprichos”’ (‘‘The Caprices’’),
provides a cynical, witty com-
mentary both on life in Spain in
the 18th century and on life ina
highly organized society at any

time and in any place.

Goya, who lived from 1746 to
1828, came from a poor family
in the Spanish province of
Aragon. He became a member
of the Spanish Academy in 1780
and first painter to King
Charles IV of Spain in 1799.

The artist’s personal concern
with social ills was triggered by
the neglect, poverty and stag-
nant society that characterized
Spain in the 18th century. The
social ills were especially ironic
set against the background of

the so-called ‘‘Spanish
Enlightenment,”’ which held
that reason is the guiding force
of man — a philosophy which,
however, went unpracticed by
the corrupt and indifferent rul-
ing powers of the aristocracy
and the Church. Goya produced
‘“‘Los Caprichos” in 1799 to ex-
plore the pretentious world he
inhabited.

The W&L gallery in duPont
Hall is open to the public
weekdays from 9 to 4 p.m. No
admission is charged.

 

REDFORD IN ‘BRUBAKER’

A Compelling, Satisfying Entertainment
sided John Well

 

‘Srebaher, ‘scutes te open

tomorrow at the Lyric, is the
latest feature in Lexington’s
major retrospective Summer
Releases of 1980. A retrospective

- Called Christmas Hits will begin
probably sometime next Mar-
ch.

Praise for Robert Redford’s
directorial debut in last month’s
Ordinary People’ has
already eclipsed the few good
notices he received for
Brubaker. Condemned _ soon
after its release as a failure,
Brubaker went on to financial
success much greater than any
of the macho star vehicles
cranked out early this summer
(Eastwood’s Bronco Billy,
McQueen’s Tom Horn,
Reynold’s Rough Cut, et al).

Brubaker is filmed with those
elements that make a movie a
compelling, satisfying ex-
perience. From its easy,
understated photography to its
memorable characterizations
by actors who do them best,
Brubaker commands attention
throughout and provokes a good

deal of thought after its initial
impact fades.

Redford is Brubaker, of
course, the all-American blond
idealist who takes over as
warden of one of those prisons
in an unspecified southern
state. The prison, as is the
custom in these pictures, is in a
deplorable state of affairs. The
buildings are rotting, there are
beatings, the prisoners are
“loaned out”’ to local communi-
ty members for actual slave
labor, the food is swill not fit for
beasts, etc. One immediately
suspects that Redford, the
gleaming hero, will, after undue
hardship, impose sweeping
reform on the institution, and
that the final fade-out will show
clean, happy convicts carrying
the warden on their shoulders
amid cheers. It doesn’t turn out
that way.

Seems the local folks, who’ve
grown fat over the years
embezzling the prison, along
with the inmate ‘‘deputies’’
themselves, well, don’t none of
them take too kindly to this tow-

headed yankee coming down
and interfering with their
system by cutting off their free
food and labor, and stirring up
the boys.
finds its way to the prison’s
board of trustees, which in-
cludes the governor and a few
powerful state legislators. They
don’t really appreciate
Brubaker’s monkeyshines
themselves, and, except for the
governor’s attractive aide
(played by Jane Alexander)
they can’t find a kind word for
him, either. In fact, what they
essentially tell him is to quit all
this nonsense or go look for
another prison to screw up.
Then they tell him there won’t
be another prison to screw up;
he’ll be black-balled from the
entire region. Undaunted,
Brubaker proceeds with his
reforms.

Redford’s performance as
Brubaker is fine; like so many
bigger-than-life stars of another
era (Gable, Bogart, etc.), he is
Robert Redford on screen.

Film Notes

The Seduction of Joe Tynan (1979) Alan Alda stars in his first,
serious effort as a major performer, and the result is one of the bet-
ter Hollywood political dramas in recent years. Alda’s Senator
Tynan, a liberal with high political ambitions, is energetic and at-
tractive; as a father and husband he is negligent and even shoddy.
The acting is powerful from one of last years best casts — Barbara
Harris as the troubled wife, Mery] Streep as the southern activist
Tynan falls for, and venerable Melvyn Douglas, in his umpteenth
senior senator role, turns in a touching performance. It is in-
teresting to note that Miss Streep and Mr. Douglas each received
an Academy award for supporting roles in different films that year,
she for Kramer V Kramer, and he for Being There. Presented by

the SAB, Friday through Sunday October 17-19 at 8 p.m. in du-
Pont Auditorium. Admission is $1.

The General (1926) The silent classic, perhaps Buster Keaton’s
finest film. A comedy of masterful timing and execution, set in the

Weekend in Savannah

by Frank Billinglsey

Student Activities Board co-
chairmen Jamie Small and
Pryse Elam attended a Na-
tional Entertainment Con-
ference this past weekend.

The three-day convention,
comprised of 147 colleges from
the Southeast, was held in
Savannah, Georgia.

Jamie Small describes the
weekend: ‘The contacts we
met were the most important
benefit. We talked to printers,
film representatives, and band
representatives. We saw
specialty acts and attended
educational classes.”’

The contacts Small and Elam
made in the music field will
allow the SAB to book bands
without going through an agent.

Small said. This will afford a
savings of several hundred
dollars normally paid out in
commission fees. Small said he
could also get national bands
for the Cockpit at cheaper
prices.

The SAB also made a deal
with a film agent in which
rather than pay to rent the fil-,
SAB profits from the movie go
directly to the film agent. This
will also save the school hun-
dreds of dollars, Small said.

_ Educational classes that
Elam and Small attended in-
cluded crowd management,
publicity, and contracts and
riders.

Small said that the ideas for

BRUBAKER

(continued from page 4)
Gradually, subtly, he reveals
the character’s nuances and
complexities with good humor
anda sense of reality. Brubaker
is not a hero; such roles seem to
be reserved for science fiction
fantasies these days. In fact,
Redford has said in a subse-
quent interview that he would
have turned the part down if it
had been truly heroic.

The supporting cast works
very well, whooping it up with
southern accents as they fume
over Brubaker. Jane Alex-
ander, who seems to be doomed
to these below-the-title roles
with a hint of romantic interest,
plays a phony liberal who likes
Brubaker’s looks but not
necessarily his principles.
Yaphet Kotto, who was so good
in Blue Collar, gives another

memorable performance as one
of the more perceptive inmate
deputies.

I often base a decision to go to
a movie on what nationally pro-
minent critics have to say about
it. I therefore almost missed
Brubaker after I read that Rona
Barrett called it ‘‘a veritable
firecracker of a movie” or
something like that. In spite of
this advice, I went, and
discovered that sometimes
Rona is basically right, even
though her writing is awful.
Brubaker is as good a movie as
any that came out this summer,
different from most prison pic-
tures in its shifting point of view
and emphasis on the warden’s
office. It is entertaining,
suspenseful, and highly recom-
mended.

Pound Collection in
Rare Reading Room

A collection of letters,
writings and editorial notes by
the famed and controversial
20th-century poet Ezra Pound is
on display in the rare book
reading room of the Washington
and Lee University Library
through the end of December.

The owner of most of the
items, Eustace C. Mullins of
Staunton, a member of W&L’s
class of 1949, made the collec-
tion available to the library for
display. Mullins was friend and
confidant of Pound during the
poet’s later years and is the
author of a book about him,
“This Difficult Individual, Ezra
Pound.”

Pound is considered to be one
of the giants of 20th-century
writing. His works influenced

Small said that the long-range
benefits of attending the con-
ference will be in the money the

such writers as James Joyce,
Ernest Hemingway, William
Carlos Williams and Ford
Madox Ford. It was during
Pound’s 13 years at St.
Elizabeth’s Hospital in
Washington, D.C., that Mullins
became his friend, visiting him
weekly and trying to secure his

Generals Receive

Mid-Term Mark ks

by Dale Park

Now at the midpoint of their
1980 season, the Washington
and Lee varsity football team is
showing improvement as com-
pared with last year’s perfor-
mance.

After five games last season,
the Generals held a 1-4 record
and were last in the Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference. This
year the team is off toa 3-2 start
and shares second place in the
ODAC with Hampden-Sydney,
Maryville and Bridgewater.

One reason for this year’s im-
provement has been a change in
team attitude. Said head coach
Gary Fallon, ‘‘the loss to Macon
(14-10) was a big one, but we’ve

been trying to put all the games
we've played, either big wins or
big losses, behind us.”’

“Slowly,” stated Fallon, “‘the
team is maturing.’’ Many of the
starters on last year’s team
were sophomores, such as nose
guard Mike Pressler. The core
of this year’s offensive and
defensive units is made up of
“veterans’’ no older than
sophomores and juniors.

One big addition this year has
been sophomore tailback Chris
Cavalline. Switched from
quarterback, Cavalline has
been an offensive workhorse,
gaining 504 yards and scoring
five touchdowns in the first five
games.

Also, Cavalline filled a big
rushing gap left by the gradua-
tion of W&L’s all-time leading
ground-gainer, Stewart Atkin-
son. (Cavalline was injured in
the Macon loss, however. A
sprained knee makes him a
doubtful starter for Saturday’s
game.

The Cavalline switch also
helped unsnarl W&L’s quarter-
back problems. Last year, Mike
Wenke, Rich Hachenburg and
Cavalline constantly replaced
one another at that position.

This year, said Fallon, the
team has found its quarterback
in the junior Wenke: “There is
no question that Wenke is our
starting QB. But Hachenburg
has continued to work hard and
can be used in situations where
we need him.”

On the offensive line, Fallon
has been looking for another
guard to complement the
steady play of senior guard Jim
Forte. Candidates for this posi-
tion include three young
players; sophomore Ralph
Paris and freshmen Carl
Peebles and Dan Seal.

Another offensive plus has
been the development of junior
tight-end Mike Fogarty. Com-
mented Fallon: ‘Fogarty’s
blocking has improved a great
deal this season and he has been
important in replacing Syd Far-
rar (who graduated last year.)”’
At 6’3”, 215 pounds, Fogarty
proves a big target for Wenke to
throw to and a big problem for
opposing defenses to tackle.

W&L’s own defense, as Fallon
said, “is learning to work
together. Yet sometimes the
defense, especially the secon-
dary, is so intent on making a
good hit that it plays the man
and not the ball.”’

Ironically, the pressure has
become greater on the
Generals’ pass defense because
of the improved W&L offense.

Booters Bounce EMC;
Lose 2-1 Heartbreaker

by Mark Schramm

The soccer Generals split
their two matches this week,
first drubbing ODAC rival
Eastern Mennonite 4-1 and then
losing a heartbreaker to Rad-
ford, 2-1. Their record now
stands at 4-2.

After getting off to a slow
start against EMC, the
Generals rallied behind two
first half goals by Center
Roland Simon (his sixth and ©
seventh of the year. )

Both goals came off corner
kicks.

   

 

k Ben Muskin evades

The first was lofted toward
the far post by Winger Brad
Poorman, and Simon darted
between two defenders and put
a strong header behind the
EMC goaltender. His second
goal was scored through sheer
determination, as he fought his
way through a crowd in front of
the net and headed the ball
under the crossbar.

Play was somewhat sloppy
during the first half, and neither

Rad

team held a distinct advantage,
despite W&L’s two goals. The
goaltending of Kevin Carney
gave the Generals an edge,
however, as the veteran net-
minder turned away some early
scoring opportunities.

The Generals got back on
track in the second half and
dominated the rest of the way.
Midfielder Mark Carduna
tallied his first goal on a spec-
tacular individual effort. Weav-
ing in from the 18-yard line,
Carduna fired a shot on goal.

Brad Poorman scored his
fourth goal of the year on a shot
from his wing slot, as he outrac-

sideline. EMC scored on a
penalty kick, but the issue was
decided by then.

_ fluence on the outcome of the

fired-up group as they returned
home to face Radford, but they
seemed intimidated from the
start and dropped a 2-1 decision.

The lack of a supportive
crowd seemed to deflate the
Generals’ enthusiasm. “I ad-
mit, we were pretty disap-
pointed,’’ said Coach Rolf Pira-
nian. ‘‘Here we had a really big
game at home, and they had
more fans than we did. We had
a letdown.”’

plays that appeared to be clear-
ly offsides, yet the goals were
allowed to stand, despite vehe-
ment protest from W&L.

Piranian, however, refused to
blame the officiating for the
loss, ‘We beat ourselves” he
said simply.

Commentary:

by Ralph Frasca

“ True hustler.” ‘“‘The key to
the soccer team’s offense.” ‘An
athlete whose desire is reflected
in his intense, inspired play.”
This glowing praise has been
reserved for Roland Simon, the
freshman sparkplug of a fre-
quently dynamic offensive at-
tack which, teamed with the
“No goal Patrol’’ defense, nas
proved a formidable opponent
to its Old Dominion Athletic
Conference foes.

Simon was showered with ac-
colades during his high school
years, notably his election to
the first team All-State team
while laboring for Edgewood
High in Maryland, which he
described as a ‘‘decent team.”
Simon helped Edgewood reach
the state playoff for each four
years at that school. As of this
writing, the Generals sport a 4-2
record, spearheaded by goals
from Simon.

“Our offense started off slug-
gishly,” he relates, ‘‘but once
we got accustomed to playing
together, we gained the
cohesiveness we needed. We
have a lot of potential, and we’ll
continue to improve. With a
young team, there’s no telling
how far we’ll go.”’

Simon takes great care to
praise the defense, which he
feels is the big key to the offen-
sive attack. ‘“‘We have a very
strong defense, and _ they
deserve recognition. I like to
think that when I score a goal,
I’m thanking the defense for do-
ing such a good job.”

Coach Rolf Piranian, a defen-
sive player during his years at
W&L, is largely responsible for
the Generals’ tight defense,

which only Wesleyan has
permeated with notable suc-
cess. Simon laments, “I respect
Rolf’s intensity, but I wish he
was more knowledgeable about
the offensive aspects of the
game so that he could help me
improve.”

Simon came to W&L with the
intention of playing for a small
school, where he could achieve
some degree of recognition.

‘‘Although the odds are against
it, it would be the ultimate goal
to play professionally. But I’m
not holding that as my only op-
tion.”’ Towards that end, Simon
intends to major in Physics or
Engineering.

The young soccer team is
already looking towards gain-
ing an NCAA bid. Continued im-
provement by the offense and
steady play by the defense may
just earn them the bid. But, as
Simon warns, ‘‘there’s always
next year. With only three up-
perclassmen starting, the
nucleus of our team will be
together for a long time. We'll
be knocking on some doors,
that’s for sure.”’

Water Polo Back On Track
With Three Weekend Wins

by Dave Johnson

The W&L water polo team
returned to form last weekend
with three lopsided victories
and one close defeat in the first
half of the Southern Conference
Tournament. The Generals
trounced Georgia Southern 9-0,
J.M.U. 11-2, and Virginia 10-2,
before finally losing to Duke 9-7
in their final game of the
weekend.

The Georgia Southern
triumph demonstrated a
tremendous defensive effort by
the Generals; a shutout in a
fast-paced and volatile game
like water polo is always an im-
pressive achievement.

The fine defensive play con-
tinued through the James
Madison and U. Va. games, but
despite the Generals’
dominance, they lacked the
“killer instinct”? to make the
games as far out of proportion
as they might have been. In
either game, W&L could have
come away with twenty or
twenty-five goals.

This inability to capitalize on
scoring opportunities and turn
them into an insurmountable
lead may have been the reason
for the Generals’ one loss of the
weekend. After moving ahead
toa 5-2 lead, W&L was unable to
put the game on ice, as they
allowed the Blue Devils to come
back and win at the wire.

Coach Remillard feels that
his young team learned its
lesson from the Duke game, and
that the problem with intensity
is now a thing of the past. He
says that the Generals’ are
“hungry”? now, and that they
are ready to do the thing that
W&L water polo teams dream
about every year: beating Rich-

After last weekend’s half of
the conference tourney, Rich-
mond is in first place at 4-0, and
W&L and Duke are tied for se-
cond at 3-1. The second half of
the tournament will be played
at W&L on Oct. 24, 25, 26, and if
the Generals can beat Rich-
mond, who defeated Duke by a
one point margin, they have a
reasonable chance of winning
the conference.

Individual standouts for the
Generals last weekend included
Freshman goalie Andy Gates,
who put on an impressive show

classmate Tim Rock, who con-
tinues to make his presence
more and more apparent.

Perhaps the most encourag-
ing sign for the W&L.squad was
the play of junior captain Mike
Bernot, who seems to have
regained his shooting form.
Bernot scored on four out of
eight shots against Duke and
was impressive in the other
games.

This coming weekend the
Generals will play at home on

decided team, Richmond’s B

date puts pressure on the student’s sex-
ual importance, his masculinity.’’

It is for this reason, according to Dr.
Worth, that heavy drinking increases
before and during dating.

“Lots of meaningful experiences are
eroded because of drinking, and this is
one of the losses.

‘And probably lots of good sex, too.”’

The psychologist counsels only a hand-
ful of students each year exclusively for
alcohol-related problems, but he has
seen it as a direct and dangerous threat.
Last year one of his counselees had to
drop out of school and go toa sanitarium.

“Drinking is so overemphasized, while
the inherent dangers aren’t confronted,”’
Dr. Worth says.

‘And there is massive denial at
Washington & Lee. Denial is the major
problem.”’

Indirectly, he finds many of the others
who confer with him can trace their pro-
blems to drinking. ‘‘Alcohol creates
sneaky delusions,” he explains. “The
student can’t cope as well, but its very
subtle, and consequently he ends up hurt-
ing his program, social or academic.”’

And, of course, one of the greatest
hazards of alcohol abuse is not the im-
mediate one: alcoholism later in life. Dr.
Worth points to statistics which indicate
that one out of 12 dr, according to some

figures, one of nine, persons who drink

 

will be alcoholics or have drinking pro-
blems in the future. Those are conser-
vative figures, he adds. Applied to W&L,
a fraternity of 36 or 48 imbibers will pro-
duce three or four chronic drinkers.
There is no panacea, no cure-all, for
alcohol abuse, but Dr. Worth feels that

Alcoholism is a concern at Washington and Lee.

the university should at least take a role
in alcohol education. “I’m not ad-
vocating a holier-than-thou approach,
but the school should promote a model of
healthy use of alcohol. There absolutely,
absolutely should be more alcohol educa-
tion — there is nothing I know of now.”

 

pus Alcoholism

He is certain that awareness is the key,
and would like to see a W&L program in
conjunction with other schools; he envi-
sions a series of speakers, films and
discussions, with students contributing to
the planning.

“The education would not only be to
help students themselves, but to teach
them how to deal with the problems of
friends or family members.

“It’s a compassionate thing to do.”

But excessive and rampant drinking is
a dilemma not easily solved on the col-
lege campus. The University of Virginia,
legendary home of the serious drinker,
several years ago took measures to curb
the glut of revelling, abolishing the enor-
mous Mad Bow] bashes of Easters and
imposing other party restrictions. Yet a
story in the Richmond Times-Dispatch
last Sunday reports that little has chang-
ed, and the words of one U.Va. student
could quite easily be the testimony of his
W&L counterpart:

“It’s not just accepted, it’s encourag-
ed. Go to any party, at a fraternity or
football game or wherever, and some-
one’s always saying, ‘“‘Come on, have
another drink.’

‘Nobody cares if you get drunk. That’s
kind of expected; ...and the next morning
your friends all laugh about it, and, you
know, everyone thinks it’s funny, it’s
cool...”’

Lexingtonians Talk About Fraternities

by Will Jackson

Beer cans, plastic cups, 3
a.m. howls, squealing tires, pro-
fanity, the occasional trampled
flower bed, ‘“‘be young, be
foolish, but be happy’ again
and again and again...these are
some of the annoyances Lex-
ington residents who live near
fraternity houses have com-
plained of. In almost every
case, though, these irritations
are reduced by one over-riding
fact — friendship.

Older, life-long Lexington

residents seem to particularly
enjoy the proximity of the
fraternities, having been ac-
customed to college life for

Lee Avenue resident
years, and having gradually
become usedto the increasing
noise levels.

‘“‘Why, we chose to live here!”
said Mrs. Guy Agnor, who lives
with her husband, a 1918 W&L
graduate, in a house on Jackson
Avenue, in the former backyard
of Phi Gamma Delta. ‘‘We knew
the boys were there. We loved
them — we still do. They’ve
been lovely to us.”’

For Mrs. Ralph Daves there

 

was no such choice of residence,
but she has no regrets. She was
born at 110 Lee Avenue, two
doors down from Delta Tau
Delta, where she and her hus-
band still live. ‘“We’ve lived
very comfortably between the
fraternities for 55 years,’ said
Mrs. Daves, “‘and I have all my
life, of course.”

The Daves met while he was
playing football at W&L during
the winning years of the mid-
1920’s. According to Mrs.
Daves, her husband, originally
from Tennessee, ‘‘was going to
go to VMI but he felt that it look-
ed to much like a — well, you
can guess!’’ They married after
Mr. Daves graduated in the
class of ’26.

Another long-term resident of
the SPE/Fiji/Delta neigh-
borhood is Mrs. Scott Huger,
who echoed the sentiments. of
most of her. neighbors, saying,

“We've always had a pleasant

relationship — the boys are
friendly and very nice.’’ She
complained of parking lot noise,
but added that she figured that
was probably unavoidable.
bably unavoidable.

Younger residents of the area
were a little more specific in
their gripes.

One, the mother of school age
children, mentioned Wednes-
day night parties as her major
source of irritation. “It’s very
hard on those of us who have to
get up early to go to work or get
the children off to school,’’ she
explained.

She also noted expletive-
yelling and noise levels as ir-
ritants. ‘I detest rock music. I
listen mostly to classical and
bluegrass. It seems to me they
could do more to close windows
in the spring and fall.” Still, she
added, “‘They’re fairly good
neighbors — basically they’re
very considerate.”’

And things are improving, ac-
cording to this woman and some
of her neighbors. One man cited
his relief that fraternities were

learning to turn their speakers
in, rather than facing out of, the
windows. Also mentioned was a
reduction in post-party and
parking lot noise, particularly
so far this year. “‘A lot depends
on who are the presidents and
officers of the houses,” said
another neighborhood mother.
“If they make an effort, so do

but with certain reservations.
Mr. A. B. Claytor, who lives
next door to Phi Psi maintains a
general laissez-faire policy
regarding his neighbors. ‘“‘I
don’t bother them and they
don’t bother me,”’ he said. ‘‘The
fellows are honest and I like
their good will.’”’ But, Mr.
Claytor added, “If you go

 

‘T wish they’d get some new

records! They’ve been playing the

same two ever since we came here.’

the neighbors.”

One of the newest residents of
Jackson Avenue, Mary Visin-
tainer, who moved to Lexington
from Virginia Beach a month
ago said she and her husband
have encountered no real pro-
blems since Rush. ‘Then, the
noise bothered us because we
were just moving in.” And, she
said, ‘‘I do mind the fast driving
late at night, the cars squealing
around the corner.’’ But her
real complaint? “I wish they’d
get some new records! They’ve
been playing the same two ever
since we came here!”’

In another section of town, in
the vicinity of SAE, Pi Phi, and
Phi Psi houses, residents were
similarly ambivalent in their
feelings toward their youthful
neighbors, generally tolerant,

annoyance for Mr. Claytor. ‘I
have a bad back,” he says,
‘‘and I just don’t feel like pick-

contents of the cups pose
another problem. ‘‘Sometimes

Lexingtonians And Their Fraternity Neighbors

(continued from page 9)
the fraternity dates stay in his
house on weekends, but his
bedroom is on the back of the
house, protected from most er-
rant amplified chords.

The noise, in Mr. Wayland’s
opinion, isn’t much of a problem
“except is someone sounds like
they’re in trouble — a girl
screaming at 3 a.m. or
something. You know, anything
could be happening.”’

Mr. Wayland is a good friend
to the girls who spend weekends
in his house, some of whose
mothers stayed there when Mr.
Wayland first opened in the
mid-1950’s. The role of protector
and confidant is one which Mr.
Wayland obviously enjoys, even
though it monopolizes a lot of
his time. As an example, he
said, ‘‘Last Sunday was the first
time I’d been to church since
school started in September
—I’ve had to look after my
chicks!”

Mr. Wayland’s fraternity
neighbors seem to have as
much respect for him as he has
for them and their dates. With a
grin, Mr. Wayland said, “The
boys know I won’t put up with
any foolishness.” Indeed, in Mr.
Wayland’s house, they never

get past the first floor. .

Another resident of the
SAE/Phi Psi/Pi Phi
neighborhood expressed her
views on life among frats. ‘‘I
like all the boys,’’ she said.
“Taken individually, there’s no
one nicer — but that godawful
music!’’ ‘‘Wild animals’? was
her term for fraternity
members — en masse — on par-
ty nights. ‘‘And the girls,’”’ she
added, ‘‘the girls are worse
than the boys! All that squeal-

ing!”’
Not an objector to partying in
general, however, she sug-

gested that the trouble with
W&L fraternity parties is that
they simply go on too long. And
she hastened to add that some
weekends were exceptions to

the rule of rowdiness.
“This weekend,”’ she said sly-
ly, “will be heaven — it’s

Parents Weekend, you know!”’
Among townspeople _ in

general and among faculty who
live near fraternities (as on
University Place near Red
Square) in particular, a ,akpr
spirce of irritation is the
Wednesday night parties, a fair-
ly recent innovation in fraterni-
ty life. Professors seem to have
a real aversion to facing half-
empty classes and dozing or
pointedly hung-over students on
Thursdays.

Still, the attitude among Lex-

ington residents appears to be
that the fraternities, despite
their tendency to aggravate in-
somnia, are an integral part of
the W&L, and Lexington, com-
munity. Few advocate the
social lodge idea, and most
seem to enjoy life among frater-
nities, except perhaps on party
nights. In fact, Mrs. Agnor said,
“I’m sorry the fraternities are
having such a hard time. Phi
Gam’s so quiet this year we
kind of miss it!”’

Newcomb Renovation Set

(continued from page 1)
W&L’s resident architect, will
execute the detailed plans for
the project. The __ initial
Newcomb Hall space studies
were prepared by the Rich-
mond firm of Marcellus Wright,
Cox & Ladd, under the direction
of Frederic M. Cox, a partner in
that firm. Cox and the firm
have been W&L’s chief ar-
chitects in all its recent building
improvements and construction
projects.

Newcomb was completed in
1882 at a cost of just $20,000
—the gift of ‘‘a friend at the
North,” as a contemporary
chronicle described Mrs. War-
ren Newcomb. The portico and
columns were added in 1909. In
1936 the building was renovated
and fireproofed.

Originally the college library
and art building, Newcomb was
designated the home of the

nomics and Politics when that
division -was added to the
university in 1906. The com-
merce unit remained there until
last month, when a $3.5-million
renovation of McCormick,
W&L’s former library building,
was completed.

Newcomb has more than
11,500 square feet of usable floor
space. The four departments
which will move into it in 1981
are now scattered across the

whole W&L Front Campus, in-
cluding in the two antebellum
residences north of the Colon-
nade — the result of severe
overcrowding throughout
W&L’s undergraduate divisions
in recent years. In the
philosophy department alone,
as an example, which has just
five faculty members, offices
are currently spread among
two academic buildings and one
of the houses.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Student Alcoholism

There are many fine traditions at Washington and
Lee. These traditions of academic excellence and
honesty are good for the University and good for the
students. But it seems that another tradition is finally
becoming associated with Washington and Lee — the
reputation of a hard drinking school. We certainly
support the spirit of hard partying, but we do not want
to see W.C. Fields included on the Universlty Seal.

Lexington’s Law
Enforcement

It would seem that some action on Lexington’s law
enforcement problem is coming to stem the tide of
violence sweeping the town. Lexingtonians are pro-

bably just as outraged as we are about the situation. -

Doubtless few students or their parents would sit back
and watch law and order deteriorate in their own
home towns.

We’ve heard Monty Briscoe pledge that he will ad-
dress the problem in The Ring-tum Phi and The
News-Gazette. Student body Vice President Willy
Mackey has also written a letter (see page 13).
Earlier this week IFC faculty adviser Holt Merchant
suggested that the IFC leadership meet with Mayor
Charles Phillips and city- council member Thomas
Imeson. Merchant stressed the value of utilizing ex-
isting ‘“‘channels.”’

Well, we call that a good start and nothing more.
The University can mount the kind of campaign need-
ed to spur the town to action as no group of students
could. And yet, we’ve seen many student causes die in
“channels.” The lack of law enforcement in Lex-
ington affects students — students are being robbed
and beaten in the streets, not faculty members.
Students have the responsibility to make their sen-
timents heard and see that corrective measures are
enacted — the University should be receptive and
helpful.

Yes, this year crime in Lexington’s streets is a stu-
dent problem — next year it will be the University’s.

Student Sick Of Misconceptions

Dear Editor:

I am one of the women so elo-
quently described in the article
in the October 2, 1980 issue of
the Ring-tum Phi entitled ‘‘On
the Road to Sweet Briar — A
Freshman’s Guide.” I, for one,
am sick of defending myself
against misconceptions about
Sweet Briar and its students,
but I am afraid I can not let this
slanderous piece go by without
some response.

Besides the security force,
the article also managed to bad-

ed in criticizing our clothes, our
parties and the fact that a few of
us like to ride horses. What was
left? AH!, but there was some-

thing else. It was not hard to
miss sexual implications. (This
must be where the Phi did a lit-
tle investigative reporting!) I

Spectator And Mommy

“Oh no...mummy is coming tomorrow.” You
can hear the wail and how! all across campus as
young men cry these words and prepare for the
torturous festivities. Mummy is no Hollins girl,
and there is no rush of expectant bliss as our
mourning friends change fertile bedding. They
shower, shave and actually wipe their derrieres.
Cherished literature is devoured one last time and
stashed under the bed. Then, with prudent
foresight, it’s stashed under the roommate’s
pillow. Every precaution is taken to ensure and
preserve the angelic innocence that is expected
and so very, very valuable.

For money listens to the good and ignores the
drunken, the slovenly; money ignores the real
you. Each sock left in the corner is worth a six-
pack; each shirt a case; each bra your in-
heritance. This is the law of economics and you
don’t need a college education to figure it out. A
can of Lysol is the secret to a toke-master’s suc-
cess.

But what do you do with her once she shows up?
How do you escape? You can’t make her do your
homework anymore...she won’t understand it. Six
meals on Saturday at each of Lexington’s

gastronomic catastrophies?. .No, .no.,.Take ~her.

down to your fraternity house. Endear her to your
brothers, the house’s poverty, and your own. But
most of all, get her wasted! Flood her with Jack
Daniels and fill her with exotic brownies. Remind
her of your professor’s generous comments. Go
for it.

-Books were really expensive, mom. And I get a
haircut every week now. Not to mention the laun-
dry bills and the cost of a beer or two on week-
ends. And you remember how all the guys took you
out on super dates when you were in school, don’t
you mom? Well, a couple hundred dollars ought to
hold me for a while.

-Promise me you’ll be good, sonny,

-Oh, of course, mom, you know I’d never do
anything wrong. And I’ll even drive you to your
hotel.

You dig deeper into your pockets; you fumble
for words...wanting to escape, but caught by the
charm of her jewels, the warmth of her furs. And
there in the corner is the blond you desire, but you
can’t blow your mother off. Your girl flirts with
your brothers; you wink but she ignores you. Mom
won’t leave; she’s dazzled by the dean; she’ll
write the check tomorrow. Mothers are a pain, but
be sure.to clean the seeds off your desk. ....

Dear Editor:

In the midst of the storm of ©

bromides and cliches descend-

and’ its myriad of statist in-

ploring us to vote, it is clear that
a more radical analysis of the
issue involved is called for.

—totally subservient to the
sovereign individuals of the na-
tion — whose only proper func-
tion is to protect the rights and
property of those individuals
from violent infringement, for
any purpose, by any other(s),
including the government itself.

A 200 year history of switched
definitions, distorted concepts,
gradual decay of the sciences of

a government that is the great-
est single violator of individual.
right this country has ever
known. The government which

presently reigns over us has

developed, from a competent
guardian of legal justice which
impartially protects the
freedom and property of all
men because they are men and
these are their inalienable
rights, to a system designed to
sell to any person(s), for the
price of the favor of some
bureaucrat or 51% of some
mob, the “right” to “legally”
violate the rights of any other
person(s) via the use of govern-
ment coercion — direct or im-
plied. And in order to protect its
own power and security, the
government has and will violate

the rights of any and all.

In an article, telling us to
vote, of last week’s Ring-tum
Phi, we are fed, as an alleged
reason to vote, the slogan:
“Take time for America.’’ But
the fact is that this is already
done for us — coercively and
regardless of our consent — by
U.S. governments. For years
Americans have had their time
taken from them — ‘“‘for
America.’’ Today state and
federal governments force the
average American to spend 30%

Police Shortcomings Cited

Dear Sirs: .

In view of the. following facts,
I feel compelled to speak out.

Fact: Numerous _ students
have been assaulted and in
some instances injured in the
past month.

Fact: Many fraternities con-
tinue to be the target of inten-
sive police efforts to enforce the
discretionary ‘noise or-
dinance’; in some cases police
have delivered summonses to
individuals in their own rooms
for use of personal stereos.

Fact: At 1:15 a.m. Sunday,
October 4th four Lexington
policeman were seen (by
myself and others) drinking
coffee and playing pinball at
Hop-In; evidently they were
oblivious to the fact that the
12:30 a.m. — 2 a.m. period has
been a high crime. incident
period.

I believe that both students
and the town’s police force have
a responsibility in maintaining
a peaceful and safe environ-
ment. Our job is to ensure
responsible conduct for both
ourselves as well as for others.
The police’s job is, at the very
least, to provide effective objec-
tive protection to the town’s in-
habitants.
some instances of student
misconduct, I wager that no one

    
    
    
  

Ww e

 

has been injured or harmed in
any way by it. I cannot say the
same with respect to the con-
spicuous failure on the part of
the police to do their job. Both
the two-bit hoodlums and their
victims have surely been well
aware of this failure. As
misordered as the police
priorities evidently are (placing
noise enforcement above
physical security), the very
least they should do is realize
that we have common interests
in safety, that students aren’t
here to make their life
miserable, and that it is their
professional duty to ‘serve and
protect’ all town inhabitants.

What can we do, then, in the
face of both official harrass-
ment and negligence? A few
thoughts are offered:

1) We must act the better
man; give them no basis for
their oft repeated assertion that

“students have no regard for
the law.”

2) Support student efforts

pressing for poties sicoiktblli
ty and objective standards in
enforcement of laws. Most
specifically, a case is pending
which questions the lack of any
definable guidelines for en-
forcement of the noise or-
dinance (i.e., decibel meters):

3) Make a special effort to
travel in groups and help those
who need company or. protec-
tion.

4) Finally, don’t give up and
resign yourself to
‘vigilanteism.’ It will only
backfire. If you thought Officer
communities fare well enough
with students in their midst. I

It is sad to note how other
communities fair well enough
with students in their midst. I
believe that we must examine
ourselves and our actions, but
we should expect no less from
others.

Response To Freshman’s Guide

To the Editor:

It is likely that the article en-
titled “‘The Freshman Guide:
On The Road to Sweet Briar”’ of
October 2, 1980, that appeared
in The Ring-tum Phi was meant
to be slightly tongue-in-cheek.
Foot-in-mouth however, would
be a better description.

Sir, the Phi might consider
“the Bush (emphasis added) to
be a good road trip, maybe the
best,”’ but to us it’s a fine place
of higher education whose great
good fortune it is to be located
on the most beautiful 3,300
acres this side of the Blue Ridge
Mountains. (We are certain that
“the Tibetan Schools for
Monks”’ situated on that side of
the Himalayas do not com-
pare. )

Students, yes women, at
Sweet Briar will be the first to
acknowledge the College’s iso-
lation. This isolation, plus the
large female population at the
school, unhappily necessitates
certain restrictions on the stu-
dent body, the need for tight
security being foremost among
them. Precautions, although
sometimes bothersome, are
most definitely in the students’
best interest. The security may
be the target of jokes both at
Sweet Briar and surrounding
colleges; but assuredly if a

tragedy should occur because of
its absence, this lack of security
would be no laughing matter.
Continuing with the same no-
tion of security, especially in
the dorms, we would like to cor-
rect the phantom authors of this
piece, as they casually state,
‘should you be_ talked
(emphasis added) into spending
the night... We admire the
authors’ imaginations but
believe a more accurate state-
ment of the situation would be
that male students, “men,”
become temporary roommates
because they are too drunk to
locate rides back to their own
double (emphasis added) beds..
In general, we wish we could
thank the authors for their
almost begrudging compliment
to our College. However, we
cannot sit back and allow cheap
shots to be leveled at our Col-
lege. Resembling “patio fur-
niture designs” in our dress and
being ‘‘closer than you think”’ in
the dormitory can be translated
to the female counterpart of
looking like dinner mints in pink
button-down and khakis and
having a gay atmosphere at
men’s college. These aspersions
only serve to alienate Sweet
Briar and W&L from one an-
other and as a consequence call
into jeopardy the truly valuable

they would summarily take all
of our time via military con-
scription. These actions are all,
by strict dictionary definition,
forms of slavery; they are
characteristics of totalitarian
governments and among the
favorite tools of our supposed
ideological opposite, the Soviet
Union. That we should then be
told to take more of our time
and use it to give our sanction to
those who would so criminally
destroy our society and the lives
of the individuals who comprise
it is a blatant step in the faces of
reason and justice.

For, you see, our vote is
precisely that — our sanction

government. Government by
the consent of the people is what
we allegedly have and we may
give our consent by paying the

is our statement that we agree
to and morally sanction the
fundamental form, principles
and. actions by which that
government functions and that
we simply wish to choose the
particular men to carry out
those functions. If Americans
can give their consent to such a
flagrantly criminal and
destructive institution, then
they deserve the totalitarian,
Slave regime which the ruthless
logic of justice will surely visit
upon us all. But although de-
struction is a basic alternative
which any person may choose
for himself, no one has the right
to make that choice for another.
Do not help criminal govern-
ments to pretend, to themselves
and to others, that their
malevolent activity has the
sanction of its victims. Clearly
so small a minority can
perpetrate such atrocities on so
large a majority only by such a
sanction — even if it is a sanc-
tion by default. If you truly care
for America — for what it once
stood — for human life and
human liberty, then do not vote
and make clear your moral in-
dignation at slavery practiced

in human society. It is our only
‘ hope.

Police Outrage Fraternities,
Ad Hoc Report Discussed

(continued from page 1)
‘“‘ways” to avoid a noise or-
dinance conviction, citing an in-
stance in which the Pi Kappa
Alpha fraternity retained a
lawyer to represent them in
court and the case was
‘postponed indefinitely.’’

Uther representatives ex-
pressed outrage over violent in-
cidents occurring near fraterni-
ty houses. Briscoe reported that
he knew of an instance in which
several outsiders allegedly
threatened people at the Sigma
Nu fraternity house and created
a “potentially very dangerous
situation’ which resulted in a
brick being thrown through a
house window. Briscoe added
that the Sigma Nus notified the
police and were told an officer
would investigate the com-
plaint, but no officer arrived.

IFC faculty adviser Holt Mer-
chant assured the Council that
the Lexington community ‘‘is
beginning to understand that we
have a law enforcement prob-
lem” and that ‘‘students are
often the victims of crimes, not
the perpetrators.””. Merchant
suggested that the IFC meet
with Lexington Mayor Phillips
to discuss the problem. ‘‘I don’t
think they understand the
magnitude of the problem” he
said.

Briscoe asked for comments on
the recommendations of the
Report of the Ad Hoc Commit-
tee on Fraternities.

Phi Delta Theta President
Hill Macalester stated that the
implementation of the Report’s
Option C would ‘‘ruin fraternity
life and detract from the
University.”’

A representative from ZBT
stated that he considered his
fraternity to be ‘‘more than just
a place to gather socially,’’ and
that the implementation of Op-

tion C ‘‘would destroy »

something that is really great

and a benefit to the school.”’

Briscoe added that many of
the Report’s criticisms . of
fraternities centered around
house finances and urged
fraternity representatives to
“get in gear.’’ Briscoe also urg-
ed fraternity members to
“make suggestions and recom-
mendations through the Univer-
sity Council,’ which will
discuss fraternities in_ its
November 20 meeting. ‘I’ve
seen the IFC act apathetic in
the past, and the University did
just what it pleased. We should
at least address the issue.”’
