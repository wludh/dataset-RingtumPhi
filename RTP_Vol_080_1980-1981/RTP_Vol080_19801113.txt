IRVING R. LEVINE

Balanced Budget
Tough Task

by Frank Billingsley

Emphasizing that it will be
“exceedingly difficult’ for
Ronald Reagan to attain a
balanced budget, NBC
Economic correspondent Irving
R. Levine spoke on the ‘U.S.
Economy and the election’
from Lee Chapel at Washington
and Lee University Tuesday
night.

Noting that the Reagan Ad-
ministration will be faced with
a $59 billion federal budget
deficit next year, Levine warn-
ed that the President-elect’s
plans to increase defense spen-
ding and cut taxes could result
in as large a deficit next year.

Levine said that “‘the tax cuts
proposed by Reagan would in-
evitably make inflation worse.”
He suggested that inflation
should be dealt with by tax in-
centives that encourage invest-
ment and job opportunity, but
that, due to campaign pro-
mises, Reagan is ‘‘stuck’’ with
inflationary tax cuts.

“We may experience a W-
shaped economic recovery,”

 

MICHAEL D. BARTINI

    

Levine said. He noted that the
Reagan administration may
come into office with another
dip taking place in the reces-
sion.

Levine said the Reagan
economic assistants are deter-
mined to ‘‘move ahead on the

economic front,’’ although he
did not have much encourage-

ment for their success.
Reagan advisers have sug-
gested a freeze in government

Pi Kappa Phi Punished For

Hazing National Secretary

by Mike Perry

The Interfraternity Council
Judicial Board levied a five-
part punishment against the Pi
Kappa Phi fraternity Tuesday.
The punishment includes two
months social probation and
suspension from intramural
competition for the remainder
of the school year, for “‘hazing”’
a traveling national fraternity
representative.

The national fraternity
representative. is also consider-
ing possible legal action against

individuals he thinks were in-:
volved in the incident.

Pi Phi Field Secretary Mike
Willis read a detailed account of
how he was ‘kidnapped’ by
fraternity freshmen. Willis re-
counted how he arrived at the
Pi Phi house last Tuesday after-
noon for a scheduled visit and
presented fraternity president
Clyde Harkrader with the
chapter’s 1980 composite which
he had found on a visit to Drexel
University in Philadelphia.

Willis says he was warned by
former traveling secretary

_ George Ship, now a graduate

student at the University of
Virginia, and several up-
perclassmen at dinner of the

   
 

possibility that he might be kid-
napped. At approximately 7
p.m., Willis told the IFC he was
‘jumped from behind and forc-
ed to the ground,”’ at which time
he informed the Pi Phis ‘‘that
what they were doing was il-
legal and against my will.”
Willis added that he felt the
other six or seven older frater-
nity members present en-

couraged the activity.

“IT told the guy at least three
times he might be kidnapped,”’
Pi Phi member Madison Wood-
ward said. ‘It was almost like
he was waiting for it.”’

Several Pi Phi _ represen-
tatives indicated that Willis

should have known something
was amiss when the group of
freshmen entered the room
without removing their coats
and joked about the possibility
of kidnapping Willis. ‘‘He could
have run out the back door,‘
Ted McQuiston, a Pi Phi
freshman, said.

In his testimony Willis told
the IFC how the freshmen

 

Jamie Hall, Monty Briscoe, Brian Gibson, Chip Nunley

“bound my ankles and hands
with duct tape, gagged me with
a pillow case to keep my head
down,” and ‘‘took my wallet so
as not to have it lost.”’

The Pi Phis then put a tee-
shirt on their national represen-

Amendments Fail, EC Seeks Alternitives

by Bill Whalen

Eleven constitutional amend-
ments proposed by the Ex-
ecutive Committee were re-
jected last week because a ma-
jority of the student body failed
to vote.

In its meeting on Monday
night, the EC announced that
only 22 percent of the student
body voted on the amendments.
According to the student body
constitution, at least 50 percent
of the student body must vote on

by Chris Peacock

A number of Washington and
Lee upperclassmen feel that
they are coming up short on the
financial aid stick. But Michael
D. Bartini, director of financial
aid, says that the problem is
Uncle Sam’s fault.

Students on financial aid are
getting less money each year
they are here from the Basic
Educational Opportunity
Grants (BEOG). Senior Bill
Towler, a second year dorm
counselor, has seen his BEOG
total drop $320 in four years. In

an amendment to make it of-
ficial.

‘Obviously, something has to
give with this situation,’ said
Executive Committee Presi-
dent Bob Willis. ‘Certain
policies which needed to pass
did not, and some of these
policies should not have to wait
until the spring to be decided.”

Senior EC Senior Represen-
tative Jim Vines stated his
displeasure with the results of
the vote. ‘‘One problem was the

that period, tuition increased
from $3,100 to $4,050. Towler’s
overall package increased by
$1,080, but the balance came in
the form of loans and, this year,
a work-study job in the Admis-
sions Office. This is in addition
to the parents’ expected con-
tribution (determined by the
College Scholarship Service in
Princeton, N.J.) and the stu-
dent’s expected contribution.
This ranges from approximate-
ly $500 freshman year to ap-
proximately $700 senior year.
Towler, like many others in

way people voted,”’ said Vines.
“If they even bothered to look at
the list, and if they were in-
terested, they would either cir-
cle a whole line or vote on only a
few issues.”’

Vines went on to say that an
alternative way of voting should
be employed. ‘‘We need a public
forum on the amendments,”
said Vines. ‘Too many of the
voters went into it blind.”

Sophomore Representative
Pete Baumgartner also gave

similar situations, feels that is a
great deal of money for him to
be expected to pay, as it takes
most of his summer earnings.
Also, he is incurring a substan-
tial debt to be repaid after he
graduates. So, to help make
ends meet, Towler has worked
in the dining hall for most of his
four years at W&L. Being a
dorm counselor provides him
with a free room and one free
meal a day. Now, because of
federal regulations that are be-
ing imposed this year for the

lot of people claimed they didn’t
have the time to vote,’”’ said
Baumgartner, ‘‘and they just
walked away.’’ ‘‘A lot of people
said they didn’t want anything
to do with it because there was
too much bureaucratic. red
tape.”

Baumgartner, who worked at
the polls, claimed he was told
by several voters that the
amendments were the duty of

Board Approves
Housing Changes

One-year changes in patterns
of student housing at
Washington and Lee University
for 1981-82 were approved last
weekend by W&L’s board of
trustees as the first formal step
in a plan that will lead to a com-
plete renovation ofthe Graham-
Lees freshman dormitory.

The actual plans for remodel-
ing the “old dorms’”’ are .a-
pected to be approved by the
W&L board at its meeting in
February or May. The board
authorized preparation of work-
ing drawings and_ project
specifications last spring. Cost
figures on the 15-month renova-
tion, however, have not yet been
developed.

Next year’s W&L freshmen
will be housed in the universi-
ty’s upperclass dorm, Davis; in
the law students’ dorm, Baker;
in a house on Lee Avenue owned
by the university and now used
for housing upperclassmen;
and in rooms on three floors of
the Robert E. Lee Hotel in
downtown Lexington that W&L
will lease for the school year. In
all these facilities and in the
university's other freshman
dorm, Gilliam, freshmen will
live two to a room. Normally,
all the rooms in the law and up-
perclass dorms and most in the
freshman dorms are singles.

The students who otherwise
would have lived next year in

the upperclass and law dorms
or in the Lee Avenue house will
be given preference for vacan-
cies in other university-owned
housing, notably Davidson Park
on East Nelson Street, where
married students now
predominate, and in the Wood’s
Creek Apartments between the
new undergraduate library and
Lewis Hall, W&L’s law school.
The university has also arrang-
ed for limited off-campus hous-
ing to help meet upperclass and
law students’ needs.

and ‘I’m a fag, suck me,”’ ac-
cording to Willis.

Willis says a ‘“‘period of

tial, will begin as soon as the
current school year ends in May
and will be completed just in
time for the beginning of
classes in September 1982.

The Lee dorm was completed
in 1904, and the Graham in 1920.
In 1941 they both were com-
pletely renovated and remodel-
ed and were connected by addi-
tion of a middle wing to form a
U-shaped complex at the
southwest edge of the campus
area.

The Graham-Lees_ dor-
mitory now houses 241
freshmen and 16 upperclass
counselors. After the remodel-
ing the number of students it
will accommodate will be
slightly fewer because of
necessary space_ re-

arrangements.

Exchange Programs

Rikkyo University has
established scholarships for
students of foreign institutions
with whom they have exchange
agreements — W&L, the
University of Chicago, the
University of the South, and
Kenyon College.

Successful candidates will
receive an initial grant of
$1300-1500 upon arrival in Japan
and a $400-500 monthly living
allowance. Tuition is waived
under the existing exchange
program.

Several approaches for W&L
students who may consider
study at Rikkyo are possible:

1. Independent study on a
wide range of subjects under

harassment” then followed in
which he was covered with
shaving cream, peanut butter
and cologne. At this point Willis
says he managed to peek out
from under his blindfold and
observe president Clyde
Harkrader as the fraternity
members paused to take pic-
tures.

Later in the meeting
Harkrader admitted that the in-
cident ‘‘was definitely hazing,
but things did not happen as
violently as he (Willis) por-
trayed them,’’ and_ that
“brothers did not encourage the
pledges”’ at the time of the ab-
duction.

The Pi Phi freshmen then car-
ried Willis to a car and drove
him to the upper practice fields.
“They carried me over to a
short hill and rolled me down it.
I stopped myself after three
revolutions and they rolled me
some more,”’’ Willis said.

Freshman Ted McQuiston
told the IFC that Willis’ ‘‘kid-
nappers” told him that there
was a stream at the bottom of
the hill.

Willis told the IFC Judicial
Board that the Pi Phis then
drove him to the VMI parade
ground, placed him in a blanket
and left, instructing three
cadets who happened on the
scene to harass him. McQuiston
says the freshmen expected the
cadets to aid Willis and left only
after they saw the ‘VMI guys
untying him.”

Willis said VMI cadets Mark
F. Burmenschemkel, David B.
Openshew and Floyd Allen
helped him free himself and
remove the duct tape from his

hair. Returning to the Pi Phi
fraternity house at 9 p.m.,
Willis says he encountered no
one and left after he found his
wallet in Harkrader’s room.

The Pi Phi national represen-
tative went on to tell the IFC
that he did not consider the con-
duct of the individuals involved
in his abduction ‘‘characteristic
of a W&L student, a fraternity
man (especially a Pi Kappa Phi
member) or any other form of
human life I know.”

“I was here to help and did
nothing to provoke this action,”’
Willis said.

Harkrader explained to the
IFC that none of the Pi Phis had
anything against Willis per-
sonally.

The Pi Phi president added
that he was surprised by such a
“big over-reaction to a tradi-
tional prank” and ‘‘was pretty
much floored by this kind of
reaction to something that had
been going on for twenty
years.”

Gray Coleman, a '79 W&L
graduate and former Pi Phi, ad-
ded that the ‘‘traditional
prank” has ‘“‘been around as
long as I can remember’’ and
that while freshmen are never
instructed to kidnap visitors
from the national organization,
‘they hear about it.’’ ‘‘This is to
some degree more severe than
anything I have heard before,”
Coleman added.

Willis went on to explain the
“‘seriousness”’ of what happen-
ed and read from the Virginia
Penal Code the definition of ab-
duction and kidnapping. Willis
stated that the Pi Kappa Phi na-
tional organization will con-
sider possible’ punitive
measures against the W&L Pi
Phis after any actions taken by
the IFC or possible legal action
taken by Willis who added that
he wants “‘some positive out-
come.”’

Willis contends that he knew
of past incidents involving na-
tional representatives visiting
the W&L Rho chapter. ‘“‘These

guys are definitely anti-
national,’’ Willis said.

The Pi Phi Field Secretary
suspects this feeling may also
be shared by the Pi Phi’s facul-
ty adviser, Holt Merchant, who
is also faculty adviser to the
IFC.

Willis explained that he
telephoned Merchant Tuesday
evening at home to tell nim or
the incident and was told by
Merchant that he couldn’t talk
to Willis because he was in the
middle of watching an opera on
television.

Willis says he found Mer-
chant’s response ‘‘exemplary of
the chapter attitude,’ and
“shows an anti-national at-
titude tied in with the incident, I
believe.”’ Willis added that he
found Merchant’s attitude
much more ‘‘positive’’ the next
morning after he had learned of
the incident.

After hearing Willis’
testimony, Pi Phi represen-
tatives questioned his percep-
tion of several details of the in-
cident, but did not challenge his
version of what took place.

After deliberating for nearly
an hour, the IFC Judicial Board
outlined a five-part punishment
designed ‘“‘to reprimand quite
stringently’’ the Pi Phis ‘‘for a
gross violation of gentlemanly
conduct.” IFC President Monty
Briscoe then read a statement
calling for 1) a suspension of the
fraternity’s intramural _ par-
ticipation for the rest of the
year, 2) two months social pro-
bation, 3) active participation
by all Pi Phi members in com-
munity service through the
University Federation, 4) let-
ters of explanation and apology
to the Pi Kappa Phi national of-
fice and Mike Willis, ‘‘assuring
the discontinuance of such ac-
tions,’’ and 5) maintenance of a
closer relationship with the Pi
Phi national organization.

Mike Willis declined to com-
ment as to whether he planned
to inituate any legal action in
light of the IFC decision.

Antebellum Residence To Be Restored

by Robert S. Keefe
Three houses for professors
and one for the President were
authorized in April 1841 by the
board of trustees of Washington
College (Washington and Lee

University from 1871) — out of .

the belief that the presence of
the faculty ‘‘on the coHege
premises will have a restrain-
ing and improving effect on the
students incalculably more im-
portant than any other step that
could be taken for the manage-
ment of the institution.”’

But there was a problem
—money. (Plus ca change...)

The college couldn't afford
the cost of the houses — all of
$3,500 each.

The hitch was_ resolved,

however, when three of the pro- -

fessors agreed to pay for the
houses themselves, on the con-
dition that the college would
buy them back over a six-year
period for what they cost
(without even interest). The
professors even agreed to begin

 

«
s

paying rent to the college as

soon as the college had bought
the houses that the same pro-
fessors had subsidized.

“They were placed on the
grounds in such a way as to
form an architectural composi-
tion with the rest of the
buildings.” All four houses were
of the same general design:
two-story temple form with por-
ticoes, flanked by one-story
wings. The outside houses in
each pair at both ends of the
campus ‘had hipped roofs sur-
rounded in each case by a low
parapet. (The parapets have
long since disappeared. ) The in-
ner houses in each pair were

given pedimented roofs and |

gable-roof wings.

‘Almost no attempt was
made to decorate the interiors
of the houses. All the woodwork
was of the plainest type.
However, the mantels and door

enframements, as well as the:

doors themselves, had a very
Greek Revival feeling in their
almost-refined simplicity....The
building committee wished to
maintain the Classical style in-
troduced (in 1824) by (John)
Jordan in the Centre Building.”’

“While the Tuscan column
capitals in the porticoes of these
houses have the same odd pro-
portions as the order of the Cen-
tre Building, their bases were
made more academically cor-
rect with the addition of extra
molding bands. There is nothing

 

Tuition Raised To $4,800

_ The. comprehensive . tuition
fee at Washington and Lee

University will be $4,800 next -

year. Rae

The university’s. board of
trustees approved the figure at
its regular autumn meeting on
the campus Saturday: . -

Tuition this year is $4,050.

W&L’s policy is that: tuition
will cover approximately 60
percent of the ‘‘educational and
general’ operating budget each
year — that is, 60 percent of the
actual cost of each student’s
education. The difference is
made up chiefly through
unrestricted annual contribu-

tions from alumni and others,
earnings on permanent endow-
ment, and other gift, trust-fund
and investment income.

Next year’s increase follows
three years when the annual
rise in tuition was kept at an
average 9.3 pereent. The four-
year average thus will be 11.6
percent.

W&L’s comprehensive tuition
fee ranks as one of the lowest

among private liberal-arts col- .

leges and universities. Accor-
ding to a survey conducted
every year by Davidson Col-
lege, W&L this year is 20th
among 21 institutions surveyed
— far behind northern colleges

such .as Ambherst, Haverford
and Princeton, whose. tuition
fees exceed $6,000. W&L ‘is less
costly to attend than all
southern colleges participating

‘in the current-year Davidson

survey, including Vanderbilt,
Duke, Sewanee, Emory,
Hampden-Sydney and Davidson
itself — except Wake Forest
University.

The board also voted to in-
crease the university’s budget
item for student financial -aid
next year to match the tuition
hike and relieve its impact on
— receiving need-based
aid.

taken directly from the Greek
Revival style in the new houses,
but their generally heavier, less
elongated proportions and sim-
ple, almost austere details
mark the beginning of a change
(on the campus) toward this
Style of architecture. —

“Talbot Hamlin wrote in his
monumental work on the Greek
Revival (Greek Revival Architee-
turein America: New York, 1944)
that ‘the whole group with its

strong white accents of pier, .

pilaster.and column against the
red brick walls forms a
dignified monument.’ He also
called it ‘one of the most im-

pressive of (the) Southern col-.

leges.’

The brick for the houses was
made from clay dug on the cam-
pus itself. This accounts for the
unusual terracing of the front
lawn.

The campus of Washington

and Lee University ‘‘is compos-

 

 

 

 

 

ed of architecturally —har-
monious and spatially related
neo-Classical buildings that
together form one of the most

dignified and beautiful college
campuses in the Nation. The
central and most significan
element of this complex, the
Colonnade, along with the flank-
ing faculty residences, give the
impression of being the product
of a single architectural eon-
cept, but in reality this splendid
succession of columned and
pilastered buildings is an evolu-
tionary product of a building
program extending over nearly
150 years. As the school grew,
its administrators and builders
successfully:used this growth as
a means to enhance the visual

_ unity of the institution.”

have remained the visual sym-
bol and psychological heart of

Entertainment

 

 

In a scene from the Washington and Lee University Theatre's “An Evening of Tudor Entertainment"
are Beedle White of Lexington, William Woolfolk, a W&L freshman, Ellen Jervey, instructor of drama,
and Curtis Swisher of Fairfield. The production will be presented Nov. 18, 19, and 20 at 7 p.m. in W&L’'s

Troubadour Theatre.

 

The Washington and Lee
University Theatre will present
‘An Evening of Tudor Enter-
tainment”’ Nov. 18, 19, and 20 at
7 p.m. in the Troubadour
Theatre.

“Tudor Entertainment” is an
experimental production that
re-creates the plays of Tudor
England, which were actually
small scenes presented between
banquet courses. According to
Dr. Albert C. Gordon, professor
of drama at Washington and
Lee and director of the produc-
tion, the plays were known for
romantic, farcical and bawdy

‘Superdance’

The co-chairmen of
Washington and Lee’s Third An-
nual Superdance to benefit
those afflicted with muscular
dystrophy announced today
that registration for those who
wish to dance opens this week.

To kick off the registration ef-
fort, extensive programs will be
in effect throughout the W&L
community. There will be sec-
tional dormitory and fraternity
presentations during the next
two weeks in our attempt to en-
courage increased W&L com-
munity participation.

If you are not contacted by
either of these activites and
would like to dance, you may
register any day between 9 a.m.
and 4 p.m. with Carole Chappell

humor.

A Tudor banquet meal will be
served, and, in an attempt at
authenticity, there will be no
spoons or forks. The play
‘“Fulgens and Lucres’’ by
Henry Medwall, who was
chaplain to the Archbishop of
Canterbury, will be presented
between courses. First produc-
ed in 1497, ‘“Fulgens and
Lucres’’ is the story of a woman
who must decide whom to
marry, an aristrocratic playboy
or a virtuous poor man.

The lead roles are played by
William Woolfolk, a W&L

Announces

in the University Center.

In addition, registration at all
area women’s colleges will
begin next Monday. Senior co-
chairman J. Hemby pleads
“The W&L students need to
make a concentrated effort to
equal the expected phenomenal
turnout of participants from the
girls’ schools.”’

In an attempt to expand upon
last year’s success, there will
be many invitations this year.
Prizes will be awarded to the
top three money raising
dancers and to the dancer who
on the night of the Superdance,
presents the most ‘‘work.”
Entertainment for this year’s
event promises Tripp Brower
will also be vastly improved

freshman, as Fulgens, the
father; and Ellen Jervey, in-
structor in drama, as_ the
daughter Lucres. Carter
McNeese of Lexington and Cur-
tis Swisher of Fairfield are
suitors and Stan Nolan, a
junior, and Joel Bassett, a
sophomore, are servants.

Tickets for ‘“‘An Evening of

Tudor Entertainment” are $3
and reservations, which are re-
quired, may be made by calling
the University Theatre between
10 a.m. and 4 p.m. at 463-9111,
ext. 371.

Registration

over that in last year’s event.
Ten or more bands are expected
to grace the 30-hour fund raiser.
The co-chairmen encourage
all those interested in par-
ticipating in the Superdance to
register soon. The Thanksgiv-
ing and Christmas holidays pro-
vide excellent opportunities for
soliciting pledges. The number
of dancers will be limited this
year as there is expected a
record turnout. Hemby feels
‘*Now is an excellent chance for
the heart of the Superdance, the
W&L dancers, to make their in-
itial pledge. Please register to
dance and contribute to W&L’s
efforts to defeat muscular
dystrophic disease. Please
“dance for those who can’t.”

Carter Family Heiress

Hits Comeback Trail

If Linda Ronstadt’s a bit too
empty-headed for your taste; if
you like a lot of the country

| you’ve been hearing lately but

you're afraid to take a chance
on a whole album’s worth of the
stuff; if you’ve been searching
| for the perfect music to get you
through a Sunday morning in
Rockbridge County; or if your
tastes are somewhat outre and
you want something to play at
parties that will keep you happy
| without clearing out the room,
then Carlene Carter might be
for you. Chances are, your only
exposure to Ms. Carter to date
|has been through her co-
authorship of the title track
| from the new Doobie Brothers
| album (‘‘One Step Closer’’).
| She’s a rarity, an instinctively
| popular artist making very fine,
| mainstream, sometimes even
commercially-oriented music,

| who will never be more than a

| very minor footnote in the

history of rock’n’roll. This is
really quite inexplicable. She
has an unbelievable set of
credentials; not only does she
hail from the venerable Carter
family (Mother Maybelle
Carter’s granddaughter,
Johnny Cash’s step-daughter),
she’s also married to Nick
Lowe, and on all three of her
records she has worked closely
with the Parker/Costello/Ed-
munds/Lowe axis. She’s even
better-looking than Linda
Ronstadt!! So why does her
career seem destined to flop
before it even gets started???
The answer certainly doesn’t
lie in the music. Her first
album, Carlene Carter,
released in 1978, featured the
tastefully polished playing of
the Rumour (Graham Parker’s
band) and a passel of excellent
songs, including three fine
originals and a great remake
‘Between You and Me,”’ which
originally appeared on Parker’s
first album. This is one of those
quietly but insistently perfect
albums, the kind that stays with
you year after year. However,
despite a substantial promo-
tional push from Warner
Brothers, the album went
nowhere. The problem is that
this can probably be traced to
Warners’ failure to break a
single; the record was a bit too
pop-oriented for today’s buzz-

 

saw brand of album rock radio,
and most ‘‘top-40”’ or ‘‘contem-
porary”’ stations simply don’t
play album cuts.

Carlene attempted to rectify
this situation with on her second
album, 1: sides to Every
Woman, with unfsrtunately
| poor results. Pointless rocker .,,

some mediocre Fleetwood Ma
| ripoffs, and a disco-tinged title

cutout bins

track sunk the record, despite

two glorious moments, “Do It |

In A Heartbeat’’, co-written by
Carter and (at the time)
newlywed husband Lowe, and
Elvis Costello’s ‘‘Radio
Sweetheart.’ It wouldn’t be so
bad if the album had served its
purpose and rounded up some
fans for Carter, but, sadly, its
commercial success was equal
to its artistic merits.

One reason for the failure of
Two Sides...was an overdose of
slickness; the Rumour was
replaced by a bunch of faceless
L.A. session bets, and the glossy

sheen producers Lance Quinn |
and Tony Bongiovi laid on the |

record was far less suited to
Carter’s style than the
straightforward approach
taken by Brinsley Schwarz and
Bob Andrews on her first
album.

Coming after

Two,

Sides...,Carter’s latest, Musical |
Shapes, released just a few |

months back, looks like a major
comeback. This time out, she’s
backed by Rockpile, featuring
Dave Edmunds on guitar, and
sympathetically produced by
Lowe. On Musical Shapes
Carlene takes a whole new
direction, exploring her country
roots more explicitly than ever
before. All but three of the
songs are originals, and they’re
good ones, too. ‘“Cry’’ and
‘“‘Madness”’ have a rollicking,
rockabilly feel to them, while
“Bandit of Love’’ and ‘‘Ap-
palachian Eyes’’ are evocative
pieces that lean more toward
folk than C&W. “Baby Ride
Ease,” written by Canadian
Rich Hobson, features a

 

spirited vocal duet, with Ed-_
munds and Carter trading off

some humorously hokey lines,
and ‘‘Foggy Mountain Top,”’ an
old Carter family classic, is

respectfully updated. The only |

weak moments are ‘“‘Ring of
Fire” and ‘Too Proud,’’ on
which Carter is swamped by the
over-synthesized support of

Clover, a band she’s toured |

with, best known for backing
Elvis Costello on his first Ip.
Musical Shapes has already
died commercially, which
leaves one to wonder how long it
will be before Warners gives up

 

on Carlene. However it turns |

out in the long run, Carlene

Carter and Musical Shapes are |
highly recommended as two of |
the finest pieces of mainstream |
pop-rock to emerge in the past |
three years. So, if this descrip- |

tion intrigues you at all, you’d
better buy now, cause it won’t

W&L, Sweetbriar Groups
Spelunk in W.Va. Cavern

by Andrew Trotter

The W&L Outing Club joined
the Sweetbriar Outdoor Pro-
gram last Saturday in a
spelunking trip to Patton’s Cave
in Monroe County, West
Virginia. The combined group
of twelve students, eight from
W&L and four from Sweetbriar,
explored the cave for more than
five hours, guided by Jim
Richards, a member of the Blue
Ridge Grotto, an area caving
organization.

Richards said that the
privately-owned cave, which is
well-known to spelunkers, is a
good cave in which to learn
spelunking. The two and a half
miles of passages provide a
variety of cave conditions, with
ceilings from 1 to 30 feet high,

and with both mud slides and
rock obstacles. The group was
equipped with helmet
flashlights, which illunminated
the cave’s many beautiful
calcite formations.

After lunch at the extreme
back of the cave, Richards gave
the students an opportunity to
experience the spelunker’s
greatest challenge: finding the
way out. With Richards follow-
ing in the rear, the relatively
simple three-channel layout of
the cave suddenly appeared to
be quite intricate, because of
the numerous breakdowns, or
subdivisions in the limestone,
which make interconnected
passages appear to diverge.

Normally, a_ river flows
through the cave. But because

of the dry weather, this year the
cave is only muddy. One stu-
dent, however, managed to find
a subterranian pond and fall in-
to it.

Saturday’s trip was the se-
cond spelunking expedition for
the Outing Club. Other trips this
year have included canoeing,
backpacking and_ rock-
climbing. This Friday the Out-
door Club will go on a backpack-
ing overnighter on the Ap-
palachian Trail with the Sweet-
briar club and a group from
Randolph-Macon.

Announcements concerning
all outings are posted on cam-
pus, and all W&L students and
faculty members are welcome
to participate.

Commentary:

Fall Thoughts

by Ralph Frasca
As the fall sports season winds its way to yet another close, I feel
some compulsion to make several off-the-cuff observations on
various phenomena which, like regurgitated cat fur, defy explana-
tion. They simply exist for us to make of them what we will.

The water polo team must be applauded for the most abrupt and
welcome turnaround of any other team on this campus. Starting off
sluggishly with a young and relatively inexperienced crew, Coach
Page Remillard has unified his players into one of the best W&L
teams in recent memory. If only it weren’t for the dreaded nemesis
Richmond. Fans will have to content themselves with the slogan
‘‘Wait ‘til next year” as Brooklyn Dodgers supporters did on an an-
nual basis three decades ago. But in this case, a year may be all
that is needed.

The football team has played one nail-biting, edge-of-the-seat,
down-to-the-wire cliffhanger after another, demonstrating what
teamwork is all about. Without any major stars, the Generals have
had to rely on every member to contribute. Oh, there have been
noteworthy players, but the team has no gamebreakers, no one per-
son to be relied upon when the big play is needed. This ‘‘lack,”’ or
should I say advantage, seems to bring out the most in each player
and is frequently the characteristic of a winning football team.

Congratulations must go to the ardent W&L fans, who as any
athlete will readily admit, are like an extra man on the field of play.
When hundreds and hundreds of slightly rowdy, vociferous in-
dividuals cheer for a team, it is always conducive to inspired play.

Speaking of fans, is there anyone who did not get a miniature
plastic football? This halftime ritual never failed to provide
laughter and mayhem. On cue, a mass of otherwise outstanding
and respectable individuals were converted into a chortling throng.
With flailing arms and desperate pleas, they beseeched the
dispensers of the plastic ecstasy to smile upon them with the
ultimate munificence and launch a projectile in their direction. One
need have fast reflexes and sensitive hands, to be sure, but vast
numbers of fans were satiated. Such priceless tokens were furious-
ly coveted but, upon acquiring a mini-football, the average fan
shoved it into his/her pocket and then, after returning to the
relative security of one’s own private quarters, cast same into the
remote corners of the closet, never again to possess the magical
charm it once had.

It occurs to me that the plastic footballs were merely status sym-
bols of some sort, profusely desired but scarcely coveted upon snar-
ing one, They had no value if obtained by any means other than
plucking one from the air. It will be a very long year until plastic
footballs add spice to our lives once again.

Cross-Country Ends
On Unexpected Note

 

by John Harrison
The W&L cross country
team’s season ended last Satur-

day on an unexpected low note.
W&L was coming off of its

best over-all performance of the
year the previous Saturday at
Hampden-Sydney. In addition
to that, everyone was finally in
top-notch physical condition.
The team had peaked at the
perfect time and appeared to be
primed to cap one of its better
seasons in the last few years
with a good showing.

But this was not to be the
case. Any aspirations of going
to the NCAA Qualifying Meet in
Bethany, West Virginia were
quickly put to rest after a fourth
place finish in the five-team
event. It was, needless to say, a
let down after a promising
regular season mark of eight
wins and five defeats. ‘‘We fail-
ed to put it together in the big
one,” was Coach Dick Miller’s

explanation.

The results from the meet, in
which Roanoke took the first-
place trophy from defending
champion Lynchburg, are as
follows: Roanoke (45); Lynch-
burg (55); Bridgewater (68);
W&L (76); Hampden-Sydney
(92). Angus McBryde was
W&L’s top runner, with an
eleventh place time of 28:24. He
was followed by John Kelafant
in twelfth (28:30) and Greg
Branan in sixteenth (28:44).

If there is any consolation to
be found, it is that the team is
losing only two members,
seniors Howard Herndon and
Charlie Warner, who in the opi-
nion of Coach Miller did ‘‘a good
job” as co-captains. Otherwise,
next year’s team should have a
solid base of sophomores and
juniors. Greg Branan, the lone
junior this year, has been ap-
pointed the captain for 1981.

Generals Lose To Scots;
Season Finale Saturday

by Dale Park

After leading 20-10 late in the
third quarter, the Washington
and Lee football team dropped
a 23-20 decision to Maryville
College last Saturday at
Maryville.

The loss reduced W&L’s
season record to 5-4 and closed
out their ODAC mark at 2-3.

The Generals jumped out to a

14-10 halftime lead on an 80-

yard first-quarter scoring drive
and a 37-yard second-quarter
scoring drive. Senior fullback
Lee Minetree scored the first
touchdown by recovering a

fumble in the endzone, while .

junior quarterback Rich
Hachenburg threw a six-yard
pass to sophomore tailback
Chris Cavalline for the second
score.

“In the first half we moved
the ball effectively and ex-
ecuted our plays well,” said
head coach Gary Fallon.
“Defensively we were playing a
sound game, with guys like Ken
Mangeniello (sophomore defen-
sive end), John McKee (junior
linebacker) and Tommy Noble
(junior defensive end) giving
super performances.”’

Five minutes into the second
half, W&L stretched its lead to
20-10 as Hachenburg scampered
22 yards for a touchdown. The

Feature:

score was set up by Noble, who
intercepted a pass and returned
it to the Maryville 25-yard line.

Maryville rallied in the se-
cond half behind reserve
quarterback Bobby Boda.
Fallon commented: ‘‘Maryville
ran a lot of play-action in the se-
cond half. We had to take away
their running game, which is
the main part of their offense.
While our linebackers were
frozen watching the backs, their
receivers ran curl patterns
underneath our linebackers and
came up with some super recep-
tions.”’

W&L held ODAC rushing
leader Kevin Skipper to 39
yards, well below his season
average of 122 per game.

But while the Generals con-
tained Maryville’s running at-
tack, Boda sparked his team’s
comeback through the air,
throwing two second half
touchdown passes, the second
one a thirteen-yard deflection
with only 50 seconds left in the
game.

Boda completed 7 of 16 for 112
yards and two _ touchdowns,
while Hachenburg passed for
his third straight 100 yard-plus
performance for W&L, hitting
on 12 of 28 attempts for 136
yards and one touchdown.

Mistakes plagued a W&L of-
fense that had an otherwise im-
pressive afternoon of 308 total
yards.

After W&L’s final scoring
drive the Generals had posses-
sion of the ball seven more
times. Of these possessions
W&L punted three times, had
one pass intercepted, and lost
the ball three times through
fumbles.

“On the day,” stated Fallon,
“we turned the ball over eight
times. In previous games we’d
turn the ball over maybe two
times, but eight times caught up
with us. Not only did we put
more pressure on our defense
by having them on the field
more frequently, but we
couldn’t get the first downs in
order to eat up the clock.”

Next week the Generals play
their final game of the season
against the Hoyas of
Georgetown at Georgetown.
Fallon expects ‘‘a tight ball
game — they have a 4-3 record
and are looking for a winning
season, while we have a 5-4
record and are looking for our
first winning record in a while.
There is a lot of motivation for
us but we’ll have to make our
own breaks and take advantage
of any key situations.”

Rugby Gains Prominence

by Phil Murray

One of the best kept secrets on
campus is the existence of the
rugby club — and for good
reason.

For years the club has
languished on the verge of col-
lapse and has been sustained
only by a vague memory of a
national rugby championship
sometime in the late 60’s or ear-
ly 70’s (no one seems to
remember exactly when).

But this year a different at-
mosphere surrounds the club,
and after a few early troun-
cings, the club is beginning to
gain unity.

President Alex Richards
gives all of the credit for this
time around to one man, an-
thropology professor Larry
Babits, who has become the
first coach of the rugby club in
many years.

After coaching at North
Carolina State and taking part

in coaching seniors in England,
Babits has given the W&L club
new life. “If it wasn’t for him,”’
says Richards, “I don’t think
we’d have much of a team.”’

Indeed, it appears that Babits
has made great strides in
transforming this group con-
sisting of mostly freshmen and
sophomores into a competitive
rugby team. The first game of

the season was a disaster, los-
ing to a combination of the Va.
Tech B and C squads by a score
of 30 or 40 to 0 (no one
remembered the exact score,
not that it really mattered).

This past Sunday, however,
the club played a combination
of Tech’s A and B squads and
lost only 30-21. Earlier, the
Generals lost by a mere one
point to Hampden-Sydney.

The increasing skill of the
team is even more amazing,
considering that only three peo-
ple on this fall’s squad played
rugby for W&L last year and the
bulk of the team has played lit-
tle or no previous rugby.

Richards mentioned several
new players who have played
well and had especially kind
words for freshman standout
Herb Funsten.

Funsten, a placekicker in
high school, was 4-4 Sunday
against Va. Tech with three
conversions, a field goal, and a

“try” — the equivalent of a
touchdown.

Another tribute to Babits’
coaching abilities is the im-
pressive spring schedule he has
lined up, which includes a five-
match tour in North Carolina.

Should you wish to witness
this phenomena or simply have
nothing to do with your Sunday
afternoon, here are a few things
to look for.

The game is scored very
simply, four points for a try
(grounding the ball in your op-
ponent’s ‘‘in goal” area), two
points for a conversion after a
try, and three points for a field
goal which usually occurs on a
penalty kick.

You might also see a few
scrums, rucks, and mauls, uni-
que rugby methods of re-
starting the action. But perhaps
the most interesting rugby
tradition is that after the game,
both teams will gather around a
keg and forget their
animosities. After all, rugby is
a sport played by gentlemen.

Finish At 9-4

 

Booters Stun Navy, 1-0

by Mark Schramm

“To be honest with you,” a
reporter said to midfielder Ben
Muskin, “I didn’t think you
guys could do it.’’ Muskin smil-
ed and said, ‘‘You know, I
wasn’t too sure myself...but we
did it.” The “IT’’ was a stun-
ning, season-ending 1-0 victory
over Navy that gave the soccer
team a 9-4 record.

Both teams were fired up, and
there was up-and-down action
from the first whistle. ‘‘We had
nothing to lose,’’ said Coach
Rolf Piranian, ‘“‘we were the
underdogs, so we decided to
come out swinging.”’

The Generals pressed the
Midshipmen, who were coming
off a victory over No. 6 ranked
Old Dominion University, back
in their own zone, and winger
Brad Poorman launched a pair
of good shots that were turned
aside by the Navy keeper.

In the middle of the first half,
Navy came back and returned
the pressure. Goalie Kevin
Carney took charge, making
several incredible saves,
punching out corner kicks, and
directing traffic.

“Kevin played the greatest
game of his career,” Piranian
commented later. ‘‘He’s been
outstanding for a long time, but
today he outdid himself.”
Carney closed out his career
with a record 407 saves.

Another senior who finished a
brilliant career was Co-Captain
Bryan Williams, who played
despite a badly injured knee
that has hampered him
throughout the season.

The deadlock was finally
broken in the second half as
Brad Poorman scored at the
60:00 mark on a shot from 30
yards out.

“Ben Muskin got the ball to
me and I went wide on the
defender,” the high-scoring
sophomore said, ‘and the
goalie came out too far. I just
put the shot over his head and it
went in the corner.”’ The goal
was Poorman’s sixth and that,
combined with six assists, gave
him the team scoring title with
18 points.

Navy fought back gamely
after the goal and brought abo about

 

 

what one W&L player described
as the “longest 30 minutes of
(his) life.’’ However, the
Generals refused to yield.
Goalie Kirk Mancer preserved
the team’s seventh shutout with

some find saves, and the
defense on the whole turned in

another solid performance.

ly 7 goals each all year, and

and Tad Renner were picked as
captains for next year...All-Star
teams will be announced in a
week, and the Generals should
be well represented, with

Roland Simon dribbles past defender as Ben Muskin looks on.

At the final whistle a melee
ensued within the Generals’
team. They ran around the field
tackling each other and the
coaches as well. ‘You don’t ex-
perience that feeling too often,”’
Coach Piranian said later.
“That was the biggest thrill of
my career.”’

Piranian fulfilled his promise
to shave off his mustache if they
won, as did the assistant coach.
Ben Muskin, however, was able
to save his beard from the
razor, much to the chagrin of
his teammates.

“What a great way to end the
season,’’ Muskin said later.
“We really put it together. And
just think,’ he added with a
smile, ‘“‘we’ve got almost the
whole team coming back next
year.”’

Star Harrier

by John Harrison

Although several individuals
have contributed to the re-
juvenation of this year’s W&L
cross country team, there is lit-
tle doubt about who has given
the Generals the most consis-
tent and noteworthy perfor-
mances in every meet: Angus
McBryde. If you had to single
out one person who helped W&L
gain respectability in the
ODAC, the Charlotte, N.C.,
freshman harrier comes to
mind.

A review of his regular-
season statistics indicates why
he is so highly regarded. He was
W&L’s top runner in four of the
Generals’ six meets and finish-
ed in the first two spots in the
overall competition in three of
them. Perhaps even more im-
pressive are the facts that he
never finished lower than fifth
in any meet and that his slowest
time was better-than-averase

29:01.

McBryde has been a long
distance runner for many

years, so it is interesting to see
how he got started. As Angus
explains: ‘‘My father has
always been into running, but
that’s only part of it. In the
tenth grade a lot of my friends
were going out for spring
sports. I decided I’d get involv-
ed too, and partly because my
father was a long distance run-
ner I went out for cross country.
I’ve stuck with it ever since.”’

He is quite aware that the
leadership of senior co-captains
Charlie Warner and Howard
Herndon has contributed to the
improvement of the team.
“They aren’t the best runners
on the team, but they do a good
job of directing the daily prac-
tices and making sure that the
team’s morale stays up. You
have to remember also that it’s
an extra academic burden for
them, as seniors, to continue
playing an_ intercollegiate
sport.”’

(See McBRYDE, page 8)

McKee Typical Of

Generals’ Success

by Ed Gonsalves

John McKee regrets that he
has only four years to play foot-
ball for Washington and Lee
University.

The junior from Clarksdale,
Miss., missed out on seven
games during his sophomore
year when he broke his jaw dur-
ing practice following the third
game. As an intense athlete,
he’d like to stick around and
make up for the missed playing
time.

things again,’ McKee reports
concerning his return after the

EC Mourns Amendment Failures, Seeks Alternatives

the EC and not the student
body. ‘According to many peo-
ple, the EC should have
jurisdiction over the amend-
ments,”’ said Baumgartner.

Willis then stated that the
amendments were actually a
student body composition, and
therefore should be approved or
rejected by the student body.

After discussing why the
amendments failed, Vines pro-
posed an alternate solution to
officially act on the amend-
ments. Under a proposal by
Vines, which will be officially
presented next week’s meeting,
an amendment can be passed if
two-thirds of those students
voting vote in favor of the
amendment.

According to Willis, this is one
of the two possibilities the EC
has. The other solution, said
Willis, is to present fewer
amendments to the student
body. Willis said that the EC
will discuss these possibilities
next week.

In a report to the EC, Senior
Representative Marshall Clark
announced that letters concern-
ing the recent violent acts in-
volving W&L students had been
delivered to Lexington Mayor
Charles Phillips, City Council
member James Imeson and
W&L President Robert E.R.
Huntley. Clark also stated that
members of both the EC and the
IFC met Tuesday with Lex-
ington Police Chief James A.

Kirby.

Clark said he was surprised
that the City Council acted so
quickly on the letter, discussing
its contents at last week’s Coun-
cil meeting. The Council shares
our concern,” said Clark, ‘‘and
I’m positive that they want to
establish some sort of policy.”’

Willis mentioned that
students will only get better
protection if they do two things:
(1) press charges with the
police and (2) give specific
facts. Willis claimed that some
changes might actually be tak-
ing place.

“On Friday night, some
policemen staked out the area
behind the Centel building,
waiting for townies,” said

hiring. Levine said he did not
see much room for that because
Carter’s freeze last May could
make another freeze ineffec-
tive.

A reduction in government
regulations has also been
discussed among Reagan
assistants, but Levine said, ‘‘I
have doubts whether that will
be achieved.’’ He explained that
behind every agency lies some
constituency that placed it
there and when deregulation oc-
curs, these groups tend to rise
in protest. Efforts to deregulate
agencies often meet failure due
to heavy lobbying, Levine said.

Levine added that ‘‘the time it
takes for any sound economic
policy to run its course and
achieve its ends is longer than
the political cycle will allow.”’
His solution was to have stag-
gered six-year terms for Con-
gressmen and allow the Presi-
dent only one term lasting six or
seven years.

Levine described the U.S.
drop in productivity as a ‘‘fun-
damental problem.” He said
the main reason for this drop
was that the tax structure in
this country does not encourage
companies to invest the
necessary money in_ the
technology which is vital to pro-
ductivity.

He also said that Reagan
economic advisers fear that
soaring interest rates may
make a _ recession recovery
“short-lived.”

Speaking on the Presidential
election, Levine said he saw
“‘last Tuesday as less of an elec-
tion than a rejection of Presi-
dent Carter.”’

He attributed Carter’s loss to
several factors. Levine said
that the resurgence of the
hostage issue and_ tbe
Ayatollah’s fear of a Reagan
victory worked unfavorably
against Carter.

Jody Powell and Ham Jordan,
two men of limited experience
and no qualifications for their
roles, worked against the Presi-
dent, Levine said.

Levine also noted that Carter
appeared ‘‘cold’’ in the debate
and had _  ‘‘computer-like
responses,” while Reagan did
not come across as the war-
hawk Carter accused him of be-
ing, Carter’s referral to his
daughter, Amy, put him in a
position of ridicule which cer-
tainly did not help him, Levine
said.

Fearing he had painted the
economic outlook of America
too gloomy, Levine ended his
speech by quoting Supreme
Court Justice William 0.
Douglas: ‘I think the heart of
America is sound. I think the
conscience of America is
bright. I think the future of
America is great.’’ With that,
Mr. Levine received warm ap-
plause from the audience.

Willis. ‘‘I also heard that there
was a complaint at one (frater-
nity) house, and there was im-
mediate response by — the
police.”’

a 5-4 record with one game re-
maining. McKee thinks 1980 is
just the beginning to a string of
successful years.

“The attitude has improved
tremendously since I was a
freshman,”’ the 6-0, 200-lb. star-
ting linebacker relates. ‘‘Coach
Fallon put himself to the task
when he came here. He made us
work twice as hard as the teams
we play, and his program has
definitely changed the outlook
for the team.

A two-year letterman, McKee
is but one of the talented
players making a name for
himself and W&L. As a
freshman, he finished fifth on
the team in tackles. This fall, he
stands first after nine games.

His teammates elected John

led a squad which is turning the
W&L program around.

An engineering major,
McKee sees football in the same
light as his studies. ““You have
to work at both to attain high
levels of achievement. One
must prepare for a_ football

game the same way one
prepares for a test — by study-
ing.”

For McKee and his 1980
Generals’ teammates, the stu-
dying is paying off.

tell that he enjoys what he’s do-
ing. He is a very relaxed,
smooth runner. The key is that
he quickly adjusted from the
three-mile distance in high
school to the five miles in col-
lege.”

Miller relishes the prospect of
coaching a runner of such a
high calibre for three more
years, and W&L fans will be
seeing a lot of McBryde

Sex Roles Discussed In Joint

by Ralph Frasea

“IT was curious to find out
what W&L guys thought about
sex roles,’ said a female par-
ticipant of an inter-sex discus-
sion held at Skylark last Satur-
day through a cooperative ef-
fort by Randolph-Macon
Women’s College and W&L.

The seminar was jointly con-
ducted by RWMC psychologist
Dr. Sam Namenek and W&L’s
Dr. Jim Worth with the inten-
tion of bringing several
Students from each_ school
together to exchange ideas on
gender roles in a changing
society, the interests and
desires of both sexes, and the
problems of dating at single-sex
schools. ‘‘We talked about
everything from abortion to
pre-marital sex, the logistics of
, women in jobs to ERA,”’ said
one W&L freshman participant.

This writer was one of the 12
W&L representatives in the pro-
gram. The contingent included
fraternity members as well as
independents encompassing all
four years. There was but one
dominant factor amongst the
men: to seek alternatives to the
typical grab-a-beer, stand-
around, engage-in-small-talk
syndrome which seems to
predominate social life in all the
area unisex schools. A
sophomore stated, ‘‘I’ve grown
tired of the usual routine here at
W&L. With the isolation of the
schools, it’s difficult to establish
a serious, honest relationship
with a woman.”

Upon congregating at
Skylark, a palatial estate nestl-
ed in the George Washington
National Forest, the par-
ticipants engaged in a name
game which necessitated that
each person create an alliter-

native adjective to accompany
their first name. Such colorful
monickers as “‘Barbaric Bill,”’
“Typical Tom,” ‘‘Crazy Kim’,
and Tenacious Todd abounded.
A surprisingly effective way of
remembering names, everyone
was well acquainted with each
other in a short period of time.

After a collective statement
of the day’s goals, all embarked
on a “‘trust walk,” in which an
individual was blindfolded and
led throughout the extensive
Skylark property by a partner,
who gives the sightless one ob-
jects to identify through the use
of the four remaining senses.

After lunch, the participants
roamed the area for an obiect
which personified their femini-
ty or masculinity. Junior Tom
Southall selected a piece of bark
in this abstract task. Capturing
the sentiments of the entire
group, Southall explained that it
symbolized the protective
facade or mask worn by people
at such situations as parties,
where one may refrain from
openness and honesty to avoid
being hurt.

The group went on to discuss
the hindrances which prevent
good male-female _relation-
ships. The primary indictments
were a limited access to the op-
posite sex caused by the isola-
tion of single-sex schools, and
the lack of openness between
the sexes.

“IT feel that unisex schools
have a special responsibility to
provide a wide variety of means
to meet the opposite sex, as well
as to promote a sharing of feel-
ings and attitudes between the
sexes,’’ Dr. Worth said.

Having mentioned some

group discussions, five to a
group. Many described it as the
most interesting aspect of the
program. “I’ve always wanted
to just sit down with a woman
and talk about the whole male-
female process. I wanted to
know what went through their
minds about men in general,
and if they thought the wall
standing between honest and
open communication between
the sexes could be torn down. It
was fascinating to engage in a
frank, no-holds-barred discus-
sion about things that are im-
portant to all of us,”’ one partici-
pant expounded.

“IT felt that a sense of op-
timism pervaded,”’ Dr. Worth
said. ‘“‘Some of the cynicism due
to the lack of communication
was eradicated, and it seemed
that all felt there was hope for
this real and pressing pro-
blem.” —

A Randolph-Macon senior felt
similarly. ‘Now I know that
men are just as nervous and
protective as I am in party

situations. If I’m bored at a frat
party from now on I can call up
any of 12 wonderful men and
say, ‘Hey, I’m heie at W&L.
Let’s get a cup of coffee or
something.’ ”’

All participants readily
agreed that much had been ac-
complished. The ‘high anxie-
ty’’ situations which usually ex-
ist at parties were discussed,
with everyone agreeing that be-
ing more open with one another
is a necessity. A real insight in-
to the ideas of the opposite sex
was attained, and a satisfied
sense of mutual understanding
were achieved through discus-
sion.

Dr. Worth, whose sentiments
were heartily echoed by all,
stated, ‘‘I hope the respective
administrations will allow us to
hold more of these, and I hope
more people become interested
and sign up for these meetings.
I would like to start a program

There does, indeed, seem to
be a movement for increasing
honesty between the sexes and
for alternatives to the party
syndrome. Randolph-Macon
Student Body President Kim
Patterson has several projects
under way at her school. Closer
to home, the Outing Club, led by
Bob Forsyth, provides an alter-
native way to have fun and
meet women in an unpressured
situation. Also, a group called
OMSA (Organization of Men for .
Social Alternatives) is gaining
support while in_ its
developmental stages, as well
as future discussions planned
by Dr. Worth. Interested per-
sons should see him.

Clearly, there are alter-
natives to the stagnant and con-
stricting social life here. All are
encouraged to take advantage
of them.

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Let It Stand

In a few short days the Interfraternity Council’s
decision in the Pi Kappa Phi ‘‘hazing”’ case will be
reviewed by the Student Affairs Committee. For
those of you who do not know the discipline system at
Washington and Lee and as a reminder to those of you
who are familiar with the system, all IFC decisions
are reviewed by the SAC. What this whole adjudica-

tion and review process boils down to is a safety valve —

for the faculty and administration on fraternity self-
government.

While we think it is unfair-for the SAC to review all
IFC decisions, we-think the SAC will be doing a grave
injustice to the fraternity system if the IFC decision.

in the Pi Kappa Phi case is changed. The IFC has im-
proved itself vastly in the past few years. Its decisions
are more reasonable, and in this case the IFC is in the
best position to make a ruling. Fraternity members |
should be able to elect a disciplinary body which does
not have to look over its shoulder to see what the
faculty and administration think of its decsions. In
short, a viable ruling has been handed down. Some
people will say the fraternity should be punished
more harshly while others will say the fraternity
should not be punished at all. But the important thing
to remember is that the IFC has to make the decision»
and that decision should be up held.

One Bad Apple...

There is no reason that one bad apple should spoil
the whole barrel. The Pi Kappa Phi fraternity pledges
set out to have a little fun and got carried away. We

think the fraternity system should not be judged by .
the mistake of one fraternity. And to add a footnote,

we hope that faculty members will not throw their
arms up in dispair because of this mistake or the
IFC’s decision. We can not help but think back to the
boxwoods incident last year and some vocal outpour-
ings from the faculty. At least one of those faculty
members is quiet now...

oe a pi News :

Of all the tasks a reporter must per-
form, reporting criminal or legal pro-
ceedings presents the greatest
challenge. Because of their somber
nature, the reporter must make all
eforts to present the facts in a most
neutral and honest way.

Tuesday night’s IFC hearing involv-
ing a local fraternity and a member of
its national organization presented such
a problem. To begin with, there is the in-
ate temptation to bring a comic light in-
to the proceedings. Unfortunately,
nothing could be further from a
reporter’s professional obligation.

duty to go beyond ‘“‘party lines’’
_report what actually happened. Any

Secondly, one must be careful to pre-
sent both sides of the case, and present
them neutrally. In Tuesday night’s
discussion, the Phi found itself in the
situation of reporting news essentially
derogatory to Washington and Lee.

In this instance, we feel that it is our
and

feelings that we have about this case are
limited to the editorial page. We fecl
that the front page is not the proper
place for our opinions.

Without this principle, we could not
legitimately call ‘ourselves a

Phi Accussed Of Republican Slant

Dear Sirs: -

If one can make broad

' generalizations: about the at-

titudes of a given school, one of
the first to be made about W&L

js that this is a conservative in-

stitution, with a large student
contingient Supporting the
Republican Party. This is well
evidenced by the strength of
W&L’s Young Republicans, if

not also by the general state of .

jubilation on campus over
Reagan’s victory last Tuesday.

Why, then, does the Ring-tum

Phi feel obligated to appease its
Republican readership by prin-

- ting. biased reporting in a
- slanted format — reflecting
popular opinion at the cost of

objective journalism?

Last week’s front page bore
the headline: ‘‘Senators Defend
Party Platforms.” What follow-
ed, in fact, was a 469-word arti-
cle on. Republican Senator
Schweiker’s boosting his par-
ty’s platform. There was no
mention in the article of either
another senator or another plat-
form. Instead, coverage of
Democratic Senator Steven-
son’s speech was printed on
page two in an article of scarce-
ly 200 words. Moreover, the
story’s introductory paragraph
makes a subjective assumption
with no attempt at all to
disguise the ‘‘reporter’s biases:
“The Senator obviously thinks

candidates should be forgotten
also as he slipped and mention-
ed ‘President Reagan’ ”’’.

Spectator And The Year 2002

The year is 2002, and many amazing events are
going on at Washington and Lee. Would you
believe that the school is bisexual now? Yes, girls
actually stroll the stately campus; you can hear
the oohs and ahs as they drool over the macho col-
umns. An etheral bliss and an aura of productivity
pervade the quiet little campus that hovered at the
brink of sterility back in the gay 1980’s. But as the
Dean of Human Relationships has pointed out, the
students have been a little too productive.

We are in the process of an extraordinary baby
boom. There is severe overcrowding in the dorms.
We’ve had to double-up some of the accommoda-
tions, but this has resulted in some more serious
problems — notably those Greek-styled. affairs
that take place on the floors. We’re plum out of
matresses and king-sized pillows.

Perhaps, then, you’ll understand and sym-
pathize with the administration’s plan to move the
campus out of Lexington and off this planet. We
were all dismayed a number of years ago when the

School of Economics was converted into a nursery
(the only building with a shower for the baptismal
ceremonies), but more recent and disastrous
events really point up the need for a change. My
God, there are weeds growing through the hill’s
brick shuttle pad and grass is growing in faculty
window boxes! As the President, Ms. P.P. Pearl,
has stated, ‘‘Venus has a lovely and provocative
atmosphere.”’ Here is an excerpt from her speech
to the Board of Erectors.

The time has come for a change. We have wad-
dled in tradition for too long. I propose a new cam-
pus to be located in the valley of Eros on the planet
Venus. We need new and modern facilities; we
need a stimulator in every room. Besides the vene-
tian climate requires no clothes; we could get rid
of these damned preppy codpieces and be truly
liberated.

Needless to say, the Board of Erectors accepted
the President’s suggestions. The new Washington

and Lee opens next week in the valley Eros. Stay
tuned.

can be enjoyed socially as well,
if one’s “priorities are in
order.’’ As have no doubt notic-
ed, I’m writing this entire letter
in English to challenge your
mind immediately to better
prepare you for your ‘‘lessons.”’
I would appreciate from time to
time an “itemized accounting”’
in ‘“‘general categories” of your
expenditures. I won’t mind in-
cluding a couple of extra quid

for a ‘‘prom”’ or special occa-
sion. Although you were rather
vague as to what this “High
Table” nonsense is — I will
trust you to use your good judg-
ment that you not get involved
in some ‘“‘drug’’ or “‘religious
cult.”

I’m only mentioning these
things to jog your conscience a
bit so that your experience will
be fruitful as well as fun — will
follow up in a few days with a
little less serious note.

Love,
Raymond

The University cannot effec-
tively guarantee students or
others at Washington and Lee
that they will be insulated
against the increasing  in-
cidence of violence in society.

The University is reviewing
and will continue to review mat-

ters of campus security of per- .

sons and property. This review

will include matters such as .

campus lighting, building
patrols by watchmen, and the
number and role of persons who
are employed for security pur-
poses.

ame

The University will continue

to work closely

and |

cooperatively with city officials |
toattempt preventive measures *

and to apprehend offenders. In

this connection, it is vitally im- |

portant for students and others
who are exposed to acts of
violence or threats of violence,
or who witness such acts, to
report their experience to city
or University officials and to
assist in assuring apprehension
of offenders.

I encourage appropriate
representatives of your Com-
mittee to continue discussions
with Dean John and other
University officials to the end of
assisting in providing an effec-
tive response to the problems.

Sincerely,

Robert E.R. Huntley

Regulations Put Limit On Student Earnings

(continued from page 1)
first time, Towler may be
without the dining hall income.
“That’s just a rag,” said
Towler. ‘‘Here’s someone try-
ing to be ambitious and they try
to keep him from it.”

Jerry Broccoli, student ser-
vices manager at the dining
hall, is in the same situation.
‘They told me I couldn’t work
in the dining hall on my own (in
addition to a work-study job).
That’s stopping me from work-
ing extra and making ends
meet. The senior midfielder on
W&L’s lacrosse team added
that he did not know what will
happen to him when he reaches
the $1,000 earnings limit dic-
tated by the federal regulations.

Bartini, director of financial
aid since the summer of 1979,
said that the earnings limit is
not a new regulation. Previous-
ly, students holding work-study
jobs at W&L were not pro-
hibited from working other
campus jobs such as the dining
hall or the university switch-
board. Bartini said, ‘‘In the
eyes of the federal government,
a student on financial aid is
earning money in excess of his
need when he takes on an addi-
tional job. And since much of
the financial aid a_ student
receives is federal money, the
government feels it can
regulate the other monies a stu-
dent takes in. ‘‘The regulation

makes sense from the govern-

ment’s point of view,” he said,
adding that ‘enforcing these
regulations doesn’t mean that I
agree with them. Please
understand that I’m not doing it
to be a bad guy...It’s my job,
right or wrong.”

The regulation is not new, but
it is just now being im-
plemented at W&L because of
an increase in violations and a
corresponding increase in
crack-downs on violators. He
said, ‘‘I don’t think there were
as many violations (nationally)
in recent years,” he observed,
“Now the government has
started taking a stronger look.”’
Violators sometimes receive
penalties Bartini would like to
avoid: “If federal auditors find
that regulations aren’t being en-
forced, they have the authority
to take away federal funds. $500
from one student wouldn’t be
disastrous,’’ he said, but added
that getting caught has meant
‘the loss of all federal financial
aid to a university for a year or
so in some cases.”’

Students may be able to earn
extra money, but not at W&L.
‘“There’s a catch,’’ Bartini con-
ceded, ‘‘I have no control over
funds received outside the
university...(and) how will I
ever know about (jobs in Lex-
ington or during vacations)?”’
But he said he realizes that
there is a problem with the

availability of jobs for students
in Lexington, unlike the
metropolitan area where he at-
tended college and worked both
on and off campus.

An increase in the amount of
funds a student must provide in-
creases each year regardless of
his BEOG, parents’ contribu-
tion, loan or a variety of other
sources. Included in one’s finan-
cial aid package is the stipula-
tion that a student is expected to
contribute a certain amount
from his own resources each
year. This amount is usually
$500 freshman year, $600 for
sophomores, $700 for juniors
and $700 from seniors. An addi-
tional increase, both in time and
money comes after a student’s
first year in college. That year,
freshmen work five hours a
week and earn approximately
$500 that year on a work-study
job. But after that, students on
work-study are expected to
work 10 hours each week.

Bartini said that such is the
policy at W&L, unlike some
other schools, because the
university does not want a
freshman to have too many

time constraints in his first year

here. Still, that means that once
a student becomes a
sophomore, he must work an
additional five hours per week.
The $500 increase in work-study
money means that a student
loses $500 in grant money. So
while he continues to receive
that $500 (but in a different
form), he has an additional
time constraint of five hours
each week placed on him.

Sometimes as a student takes
on responsibilities to help con-
tribute to his expenses, he finds
little time for his work. Chip
Nunley is an assistant head
dorm counselor thie year. Also,
he has a work-study job in the
placement office. These posi-
tions provide him with a free
room in Graham-Lees dor-
mitory, two meals each day in
the dining hall and approx-
imately $1,000 per year. Nunley
also plays football and has serv-
ed on the Interfraternity Coun-
cil. His freshmen year, he did
not have a work-study job.
When he began one his
sophomore year it meant 10 less
hours of free time.

The next year he became a
dorm counselor, another drain

on his free time. This year, he is
an assistant head, meaning
even more responsibility. After
classes, his job, football prac-
tice and supper, it’s back to the
dorm in the evening. Once
there, he may have additional
duties as dorm _ counselor.
“There’s hardly any time for
work,’’ he lamented.

Nunley said he had been
under the impression that his
grant might be increased if his
grades were high. He has main-
tained a 3.3 average, but his
grant has gone down about $300
although the total package has
remained the same.

According to Bartini, the
BEOG determination is out of
his hands. “I don’t do anything
to determine that,’’ he said. A
student’s package is determin-
ed first of all by the federal
government, which decides how
much of a BEOG will be award-
ed. Then the work-study job’s
value and a National Direct Stu-
dent Loan (now about $1,200)
are added to the package. The
remainder is made up by
various grants, including
University grants, Bartini ex-
plained.
