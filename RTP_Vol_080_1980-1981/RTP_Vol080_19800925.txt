Violence Erupts In

Freshman Attacked On Henry St,
Phi Kap Prowler Suspect Arrested

by J. R. Smith

Several students were
assaulted by local youths in an
incident which took place early
Sunday morning.

According to Tommy Pritch-
ard, a W&L freshman, he, along
with a 1980 graduate of Wash-
ington and Lee and four Hollins
College students, were attacked
by a group of about ‘8 to 10”
black youths accompanied by
one black woman at approx-
imately 1:00a.m.

Pritchard’s group was walk-
ing from the Phi Delta Theta
house following a party there to
a car parked across the street
on Henry Street. The gang ac-
costed them at the car and
Pritchard asked them to leave
his group alone.

The group continued to
harass the students, and Pritch-
ard turned back toward the
fraternity house for help. The
youths stopped him and ordered
him to return to the car.

When he did return to the
automobile, the assailants
began shoving him around and
took the car keys.

The youths then began to
strike Pritchard. ‘‘They began
to hit me,” said Pritchard, ‘‘and
then someone struck me with
something from behind. I fell
and pretended to be un-
conscious.”

A few of the youths then fled,
but some of them remained and
kicked Pritchard and told him
to get on his feet. The girl in the
group helped the freshman to
his feet and into the car.

The other locals continued to
strike Pritchard and the other
students in the car. At that point
the group was able to drive
away to safety.

The incident occurred over a

period of approximately fifteen
minutes.
“What really bothered me,”
said Pritchard of the incident,
“was that, just a half a block
away, the cops were checking
the noise levels at some of the
fraternities.”

Nothing was stolen in th-
assault.

In a related incident, the Phi
Kappa Sigma fraternity house
was broken into on September
7. According to Tim Weed, a

sophomore living in the house,
he was awakened by a man
prowling through the rooms at
approximately 5:30a.m.

The prowler was armed with
a knife, which he dropped while
fleeing when Weed startled
him.

Major Changes Advocated

 

The Lexington Police have
charged a man with the break-
ing and entering of the Phi Kap-
pa Sigma house. Michael Cash,
30, previously charged with
assault, was charged Monday

Fraternity Study Released

by Mike Perry

University officials
distributed copies last week of a
report submitted by the Ad Hoc
Committee on Fraternity
Financial Relations appointed
by University President Robert
Huntley.

The report outlined a state-
ment on the current status of
fraternities, made short run
recommendations and recom-
mended ‘‘the construction of a
Fraternity Social Complex” as
a long run objective.

Model C, one of three models
suggested in the report, envi-
sions the construction and
maintenance of a number of
fraternity lodges on the back
campus behind the Law School.
Any equity from the sale of ex-
isting fraternity houses would
be applied toward the construc-
tion of the complex by the
University.

Dean of Fraternity Affairs
Dan Murphy, also a member of
the ad hoc committee, says he
expects student reaction to the
report’s recommendations to be
negative, but adds that ‘‘in the

long run Model C might be the
most viable approach’’ both in
terms of the economic survival
of fraternities at W&L and their
relationship with the Lexington
community.

Murphy admits that the im-
plementation of Model C will
mean more for fraternities than
a change of location. The plan
calls for construction of frater-
nity lodges, to be considered
“primarily social centers’’ and
‘not live-in houses.”’ Displaced
students would be expected to
eat in Evans Dining Hall which
could handle the _ increase
“simply my extending its serv-
ing hours.’’ The report adds
that expanded University hous-
ing would also be required.

Dean Murphy, a W&L alum-
nus and former fraternity
member, adds that the report
reflects the attitude ‘‘perceived
by faculty members that frater-
nities are just a place to party.”
Murphy says the ‘‘Administra-
tion continues to support the
idea of fraternities,’’ but is ask-
ing them to ‘“‘justify their ex-
istence. beyond being just a

place to party.’’ Murphy adds
that many fraternities have
“gotten away from their
ideals.”’

Dean of Students Lewis John,
chairman of the ad hoc commit-
tee, emphasizes that the report
is that of a preliminary commit-
tee and is intended to serve as a
basis for ‘‘widespread discus-
sion before any long range ac-
tion is taken.”’ John is hopeful
that the report will start some
dialogue ‘‘in which all prospec-
tives of viewpoints are given a
fair hearing.”

John also points out that Plan
C is one of three models, none of
which is ‘‘pure’”’ and any long
‘simply by extending its serv-
ing hours.’’ The report adds
we are not wedded to the
report,’’ he said.

Dean John says the Universi-
ty will seek to implement the
short run recommendation of
the report which includes the
administration of the fraternity
maintenance and financial ser-
vices programs. Dean John
states that the University plans

Hollins Student
Rape Reported

by Bill Whalen
and
J.R. Smith

Among the various crimes to
hit the Washington and Lee
community this past week,
perhaps the most important,
yet the most perplexing, is the
“reported rape” involving an
18-year-old Hollins College
freshman.

Reports on the incident vary
from administration to ad-
ministration. The only official
statement has come from Lex-
ington Police Chief James A.
Kirby, who labeled the incident
a “reported rape.”

“We are investigating it as a
reported rape,” said Kirby,
“‘but I’m not saying that it was a

rape.”
According to Kirby, the
‘reported rape’’ was not

reported to the Lexington
Police Department until 6:00
Thursday morning. Chief Kirby
did mention the woman was ad-
mitted to Stonewall Jackson
Hospital, where she stayed for
approximately one hour before
returning to Hollins.

The exact details of the inci-
dent are what remain a
mystery at this time. While Kir-
by labeled the matter a
“reported rape,’’ Hollins Dean
of Students Baylies Willey at
first claimed to have no
knowledge of the incident, then
stated that there actually was
no rape.

When reached by telephone, a
friend of the reported victim
claimed that the rape did occur
as reported. When also reached
by phone, the reported victim
herself refused to give any
statements.

Details of the incident vary
from source to source. Both
sources agree on the time of the
rape, between 11:30 p.m. and 12
midnight on Wednesday,
September 17.

The actual site of the incident
varies from account to account.
The police report states that the
action took place on Washington
St., somewhere between Lee
Avenue and Jefferson St.
Another account gives the site
as being somewhere near the
area between the Doremus
Gymnasium parking lot and the
Graham-Leés dormitory.

Fancy Dress Changes Debated

by Frank Billingsley

The Student Activities Board
is presently debating moving
the Fancy Dress Ball from Fri-
day to Saturday night, with the
co-chairmen at odds on the
issue.

Sophomore co-chairman
Pryse Elam agrees with the
idea. He said, ‘“‘When Fancy
Dress was started again in 1974
it was held on Friday so as not
to conflict with fraternity par-
ties. Now it should be the
highlight of the weekend.”

SAB advisor Mike Capetto
first approached Elam with the
suggestion after a recent study
of Independent life at W&L
showed that holding the Fancy
Dress Ball on Friday night was
inconvenient to Independents.
Their weekend is virtually over
after Friday.

‘Whatever serves most of the
students best should be done,”’
Capetto said. ‘‘If Saturday night
is not inconvenient to frater-
nities, and will make the
weekend better for Indepen-
dents, why not have it on Satur-
day night?”

Senior co-chairman Jamie
Small responded that ‘A Fri-
day night Fancy Dress would
make Saturday night entertain-
ment in the Cockpit possible for
those not desiring to attend
fraternity parties. A University
function on Sunday would also
prolong the weekend for In-
dependents.”

Small also noted that a Satur-
day night FD would follow a
Saturday grain party, and
many persons might miss the
dance. ‘Having the grain party
on Friday night might bother
the administration.’

Elam pointed out that if FD
were on Saturday night then
dates would have more time to
arrive on campus without being
rushed to the dance. This would
particularly benefit law
students who date outside the
surrounding community. How-
ever, Small disagrees. ‘‘Most
dates are here Thursday night
or early Friday. Everyone
comes late to the dance
anyway.”

Elam still advocated that the
Fancy Dress Ball should be the

highlight of the weekend. Small
countered, ‘‘But Fancy Dress is
the highlight of the weekend no
matter when it is. We could
have it at four in the morning
and people would still be here.”

SAB Secretary Blake Wither-
ington, agreeing with Small,
added, ‘‘If all the parties lead
up to Fancy Dress on Saturday
night, people will be too burned
out to enjoy it.”

A clear issue in the matter is
whether the SAB members are
willing to give up a large part of
their weekend for last minute
preparations. A Saturday night
Fancy Dress would require that
they do. Small and Withering-
ton both admitted they would
rather enjoy themselves, but
their first priority is to serving
the students.

Traditionalists should note
that Fancy Dress was always
held on Saturday night until the
dance was discontinued during
the Vietnam era.

A decision will be made at an
open meeting this Sunday night
at 7:00, Room 208, University
Center. All students with com-
ments or suggestions are en-
couraged to attend.

Professors On Leave

Seven Washington and Lee
University teachers are on
leaves of absence this fall,
undertaking research projects
that range from a study of an-
cient Greek economic theory to
physical education in the Com-
munist world.

Three faculty members are
abroad for the fall term: Nor-
man F. Lord, professor of
physical education, who is car-
rying out the research into
sports culture and_physical-
training programs in the Soviet
bloc; Clark R. Mollenhoff, pro-
fessor of journalism, who is in-
vestigating the relationship be-
tween the British press and
England's’ institutions of
government; and Maurice D.
Leach, Jr., W&L’s librarian,
also in England, studying
library support there for college

research programs.

 

Mollenhoff is participating in
the faculty exchange program
between W&L and Oxford
University, and is affiliated
with University College, one of
Oxford’s component _ institu-
tions.

Dr. S. Todd Lowry, professor
of economics, is studying the
economic and legal concepts
that characterized ancient

Greece, and Andrew W.
McThenia, professor of law, is
conducting research into stan-
dards for issuing injunctions
and on a problem in contract
damages.

by Dave DeHay

Six teachers have been added
to the undergraduate faculty at
Washington and Lee. Five of
those will be serving on a tem-
porary basis, either in ex-
change programs or to replace
W&L faculty members on
leaves of absence.

The Ring-tum Phi interview-
ed three professors: Herman A.
Lauter, visiting associate pro-
fessor of philosophy; Lawrence
E. Babits, assistant professor of
anthropology; and E.A. Vin-
cent, visiting professor of
geology. David Bausum, assis-
tant professor of mathematics;
Iain S. McLean, visiting pro-
fessor of politics; and Richard
R. Grefe, instructor and assis-
tant reference and_ public-
services librarian will be
spotlighted in the next issue.

Lauter has taught at Occiden-
tal College in Los Angeles for 17
years, and is currently asso-
ciate professor of philosophy
and chairman of the philosophy
department at Occidental.

‘“‘We’ve lived in Los Angeles
for 23 years, which I guess
makes us native Californians,”
said Lauter, whose wife came
with him to Lexington.

Lauter is at W&L through an
exchange program. ‘Professor
Martin (of W&L’s philosophy
department) thought an ex-
change program would be a
good idea and wrote to Occiden-
tal to see if anyone was in-
terested,’’ said Lauter. ‘‘We
corresponded a while, and I
decided to come here. It’s been
really nice so far.”

Lauter teaches Logic, and a
course entitled ‘“‘Personal Iden-
tity and Immortality,” which
has been taught by professor
Martin. Lauter taught a similar
course at Occidental, and says
that the students are ‘pretty
much alike, except there are

girls at Occidental.”’
Lauter’s interests include
music, movies and “travel

—one of the reasons I’m here.”’
He will be at W&L through the
fall term, then return to Los
Angeles.

Babits, who lived in Pro-
vidence, Rhode Island, before
coming here, is replacing a
W&L professor on a leave of
absence this year.

He also came to Washington
and Lee because he has ‘‘been
doing a lot of research oriented
toward the Piedmont south for a
long time, and there is also an
ongoing research program here
that’s related to my own in-
terests, which was very for-
tunate,”’ he said.

This fall, Babits is teaching
Survey Anthropology, Anthro-
pological Theory and Physical
Anthropology. In the winter, In-
troductory Anthropology and
North American Prehistory.

This spring he’ll be working
with a field group, which will be
making a dig at a site to be
determinated by the Survey An-
thropology class this fall.

“The Survey course is going
to accurately assess the
relative importance of a series
of sites in the western. part of
the county,” Babits said. ‘‘Bas-
ed on that analysis, then we’ll
decide which sites we’re going
to dig.”

The sites consist of ‘‘isolated
farmsteads, ruined log cabins,”
said Babits, and the survey
class will make preliminary
digs, which will be the basis for
‘“‘proper excavations’? in the
spring.

Babits is living in Lexington
with his wife and a cat, and
plays rugby and sews in his
spare time.

Vincent, visiting professor of
geology, is in the United States
for the first time. He is pro-
fessor and head of the depart-
ment of geology and
mineralogy at the University of
Oxford, and has been president
of the Mineralogical Society of
Great Britain. He has lived in
Oxford off and on for 30 years.

Interviews With New Members Of Faculty

 

New faculty at Washington and Lee University, from left to right: James T. Yashiro, visiting professor
of religion; Richard Mogavero, visiting instructor in drama; Herman A. Lauter, visiting associate pro-
fessor of philosophy; Ellen Jervey, lecturer in drama; David Bausum, assistant professor of
mathematics; E.A. Vincent, visiting professor of geology; Bruce H. Herrick, professor of economics
and head of the department; Samuel E. Stumpf Jr., assistant professor of law; Herbert Fingerette,
Frances Lewis scholar-in-residence in the School of Law; William S. Geimer, assistant professor of law;
Thomas L. Shaffer, professor of law; Richard F. Grefe, instructor and assistant reference and public-
services librarian; and Lawrence E. Babits, assistant professor of anthropology.

 

Vincent was invited to W&L
by Professor Ed Spencer, head

of the geology department, as

part of the exchange program
between Oxford and W&L. He
and his wife came earlier in the
summer and travelled through
Montana, Utah and Arizona
before arriving in Lexington.

Vincent is enjoying his stay in

Lexington ‘‘thoroughly. It
sounds trite, doesn’t it, but I
happen to think that everybody
is so extraordinarily friendly
and welcoming,’’ he said.
_ “So far,” Vincent said, ‘‘I
haven’t seen much difference
between the students here and
those at Oxford, but I’ll be able
to determine that better later in
the term. They’re all dedicated
young men.”’

Vincent is teaching a seminar
class in geochemistry, and may
also “take over bits of some
classes in mineralogy,” while
he is here for the fall term.

Film Notes—

Bonnie and Clyde (WB 1967) —- The glamorized treatment of the
Depression-era bandits was a landmark in movies, blending humor
and poignancy with (then) intense violence. Warren Beatty produc-
ed and starred as Clyde Barrow with Faye Dunaway in the role that
established her as a star. An extremely enjoyable film, with ex-
cellent direction by Arthur Penn, Academy Award-winning
photography, and Flatt-Scruggs music. The wonderful supporting
cast includes Gene Hackman, Estelle Parsons (hilariously shrill
and obnoxious), Michael J. Pollard, Gene Wilder, and Dub Taylor.
Presented by the SAB, Friday through Sunday, September 26-28 at
7 and 9 p.m. in duPont Auditorium. Admission is $1.

 

 

The Birth of a Nation (1915) —This Civil War epic by the legend-
ary D.W. Griffith was a milestone in movie making, and for many
years was considered the monumental achievement of cinema. It
changed the history of the medium. Lillian Gish, currently honored
ina major retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York
City, heads a ‘‘cast of thousands.’’ Shown by the Journalism Dept.,
Tuesday, September 30 at 7 and 9 p.m. No admission is charged.

 

The Washington and Lee Film Society begins its third year with
an organizational meeting on Tuesday, September 30th at 7:30 P.M.
in Classroom ‘‘3”’ of Payne Hall. The Film Society brings recent in-
ternational films of exceptional quality free of charge to the W&L
community. Anyone interested is encouraged to attend.

WLUR Announces Programs

WLUR signed on the air last
Sunday, Sept. 21, and the staff
has some special programming
planned. In addition to several
of the favorites from last year,
the basic format has been re-
worked to better meet the
preferences of the student body,
and the Lexington community.

One new weekly presentation
is the Sunday Concert Series.
This ninety-minute program
will feature un-released music
recorded live in concert. For
those who are interested in
building their tape library, this
show should be a welcome addi-
tion to the program schedule.

Afternoons at WLUR will con-
tinue to feature jazz. Afternoon
Jazz boasts both new releases
and the classics of jazz.

Classical Showcase will also
return this year. Classical
music will fill the airwaves
from 6-9:30 p.m. Sunday
through Friday.

The weeknight line-up has
also changed from last year. A
new program, Skyline, will run
from 9:30 to 11:30 p.m. Skyline
is electric music — mostly rock,

but fusion jazz will also be in-
cluded. This new show is an ex-
periment in non-commercial
electricity.

Another returning favorite is
Third Ear. Third Ear is free-
form radio ranging from elec-
tric jazz to obscure rock; from
bluegrass to electronics. There
is no standard format for Third
Ear; each disc jockey gives his
show its own flavor.

Besides musical entertain-
ment, WLUR features news,
sports and public affairs pro-
gramming. There are four
newscasts daily.

WLUR receives its state and
national news from the AP wire
service, while local news is
reported by staff reporters.
Public Affairs programming
deals with issues of both cam-
pus and local concerns.

This fall, several of the home
football games will be covered
by WLUR sports. The sports
department has also added a
new program to its line-up call-
ed SCOREBOARD. All the
day’s college and professional
scores will be covered just

Valley True Value Hardware

Thue Value

before dinner on Saturday.
Special programming makes
up the remainder of this year’s
schedule. Sunday boasts Two on
the Isle, A Broadway show
tunes program. Horizons will
start off featuring a different
artist each week recorded live
at the Ljublana Jazz Festival.
The Anti-Headache Machine is
back on Saturday evening — a
show which must be listened to
for appreciation. The broadcast
day is begun with Morning
Magazine: a mixture of rock
and jazz and talk which won’t

‘ blast you out of bed in the morn-

ing. Morning Magazine is
followed by AM on FM which of-
fers something different every
day — from blues to bluegrass.

x JAZZ REVIEWS*

 

Swingin’
Lester

by Mark Schramm

Reviewing the recordings of
Lester Young, ‘“‘The President
of the Tenor Sax,”’ is no small
task. The knowledge that he
was one of the greatest soloists
in jazz history, that he possibly
influenced more musicians than
any other jazz figure, and that
his melodic ideas led to be-bop,
rhythm and blues, and cool jazz
make an objective appraisal of
his work difficult. One of the
most recorded of jazz artists,
Young never released a sound
that did not merit attention
(Check the Rolling Stone record
guide — all but one of his listed
albums have five stars). The
latest of his works is no excep-
tion; LESTER YOUNG IN
WASHINGTON D.C. 1956
(Pablo 2308 219) should be an in-
dispensible part of every jazz
enthusiast’s collection.

These recordings were made
during Young’s stint at Olivia
Davis’ Patio Lounge as he was
accompanied by the Bill Potts
Trio. The empathy between the
group is obvious from the out-
set, and Young swings mightily
throughout. A Foggy Day
exhibits Young’s style of com-
bining light, swinging eighth-
note passages with some hard-
nosed blowing. He treats I Can't
Get Started with delicacy and
tenderness; his note bending
and subtle tone inflections com-
bine with his underlying sense
of melancholy to make this a
highlight. Fast B-Flat Blues is a
foot-stomping jam, and D.B.
Blues cooks as Young incor-
porates 16th and 32nd note
passages into his final chorus.
Tea for Two is a surprising
ringer, possibly because Young
eschews the mushy, overblown
treatment the song often
receives and imbues it with
vitality and humor; in the mid-
dle of a strongly swinging
chorus, Young suddenly gives
out seven perfectly syncopated,
cacaphanous honks from the

Blythe’

Spirit
by Spencer Leffel

Arthur Blythe’s latest release
provides further evidence that
he is developing into one of the
major jazz artists of our time.
His virtuosity on the alto sax-
ophone has never been in ques-
tion. But Illusions demonstrates
that his abilities as composer
and leader are reaching an
equally lofty plateau.

Blythe actually leads two
groups on this recording. One is
a traditional quartet composed
of sax, piano, bass and drums,
The other features an unusual
instrumental lineup (a Blythe
specialty) consisting of sax,
cello, electric guitar, tuba and
drums.

This latter group creates a
most interesting sound. To
begin with, in my opinion, no
one has ever played bass lines
on tuba better than Bob
Stewart. He is very smooth, he
swings with vigor and his play-
ing exhibits none of the flab-
biness which is too often
characteristic of jazz tuba.
James ‘Blood’? Ulmer sounds
somewhat like early John
McLaughlin, but he is both
funkier and more free (kind of
like a fusion between Funka-
delic and Ornette Coleman).
His playing stands out on Bush
Baby, a tune Blythe first record-
ed several years ago with conga
and tuba accompaniment.

The new version is much
funkier thanks largely to
Ulmer, but it still retains the
African feeling of the original.
Abdul Wadud displays innova-
tive cello style which could have
a great influence on future uses
of the instrument in jazz. His
main contributions are added
color and texture, as he circles
and plays-off of Blythe’s fervent
soloing.

While he has created a very
innovative sound with this
quintet, Blythe’s best playing
on the album is with the stan-
dard quartet. He receives sym-

EC Makes Appointments,

Returns Salaries To Editors

Appointments to the Faculty
Committee were made by the
Executive Committee at its
Monday night meeting.

The E.C. appointed Winston
Burkes and Al Hintz to fill the
two positions on the Courses
and Degrees Committee.

Mike Perry and Jay Dunne
were selected for the Freshmen
Admissions Committee.

Thomas Conners was ap-
pointed to fill the position on the
Lectures Committee.

Robert Neely, Ted Fletcher,
and Jed Dunn were chosen as
the three Library Advisory
Committee members.

Two of the three positions on
the Student Health Committee
were filled by Bob Burkman
and Bob Benue. The other posi-
tion is filled by a person chosen
by the E.C.

The E.C. appointed Frank
Eppes, Mike McFadden, and
Robert Nelly as University
Athletic Committee members.

Jack Sharman was appointed
to one of the Faculty Executive
Committee positions. Student
Body Vice-President Willie
Mackie is an _ automatic
member.

There were no applications
for the two positions on the Stu-
dent Financial Aid Committee.

All E.C. appointments are
made with approval of the
President of the University.

E.C. President Bob Willis mo-
tioned that instead of these
committees waiting until the
January meeting, that there be
an earlier meeting of these
committees to ‘‘see how they
are rolling.’’ His suggestion of a
meeting for October 27 was
unanimously passed by the
board.

In addition, he motioned that
the E.C. send out letters of
thanks to those who applied to
positions on the Faculty Com-
mittee.

Peter Eliades, editor of the
Calyx, and Ring-tum Phi editor
John Billmyre questioned the
validity of last year’s E.C. deci-
sion saying that no student was
to have his or her salary paid
out of student body funds.

Until last spring, the Calyx
and the Ring-tum Phi split 45

percent of Pub Board funds
with their business managers,
the other 55 percent going back
to the Pub Board.

Both Eliades and Billmyre
said that they were questioning
the validity of the E.C. decision,
since it came after the election
of officers by the Pub Board.
They agreed and emphasized
along with E.C. member Mar-
shall Clarke that it was the
“‘timing”’ of the decision, not the
decision itself that they were
questioning.

Eliades and Billmyre made it
clear that they agreed with last
year’s decision to curtail
editors’ salaries and that they
would just as soon see some
type of academic credit replace
the monetary reward gained
from the full-time job of run-
ning the Ring-tum Phi and the
Calyx.

As a result of their request,
the E.C. struck down last year’s
motion with a 6-3 vote.

Further discussion of the
matter will be taken up after
E.C. member Jim Vines can
make a full report on the situa-
tion.

In other business, Pryse
Elam, SAB film chairman, re-
quested approval by the E.C. to
raise the number of film com-
mittee members from 17 to 25.
He asked that two under-
graduates from each class be
added to the committee.

The E.C. granted his request.

The E.C. unanimously voted
that Not For Resale (NFR) at
Higher Price be printed on
University concert tickets so as
to avoid a recurrence of the
scalping which occurred at last
year’s ‘“‘Night Hawks” concert.

Believe It Or Not
Campus Vandalism

by Ralph Frasca

School Proctor Charles Mur-
ray believes that two incidents
of vandalism, one in the men’s
locker room of Doremus Gym-
nasium late Thursday night and
another in the Law School
lounge early Sunday morning,
may have been perpetrated by
the same individual, although
he discounts student involve-
ment.

“We do not feel that a
member of the student body
would have committed these
acts, as there is no apparent
motive which would lead us to
believe otherwise.’’

The defacing of numerous
lounge chairs and tables in the
Law School, and the destruction
of various sports equipment
items belonging to several
faculty members, notably Dean
Atwood and Professor Smith,
carries the same modus operan-
di — lengthy slash marks from

a sharp knife’ were
characteristic of each.
However, there were two

distinct incidents of theft which
also occurred last week.
Someone apparently used a
master key to steal approx-
imately $525 in checks and $300
to $350 in cash from the

Registrar Head's office last
Wednesday night.
“We believe it was an

amateur, because a_profes-
sional would not have bothered
to steal checks, which are of no
use to the thief,’’ Murray said.
He went on to say that there are
numerous individuals who
possess master keys to the
Registrar’s office, including the
secretaries, carpenters, electri-
cians, plumbers, and many key
University personnel — some
forty people in all.

Registrar Head suspects that
it may have been someone with
knowledge of the working of the
Registrar’s office. ‘‘We normal-
ly don’t have money in the of-
fice, but last week we happened
to, unfortunately. The thief
must have known that we had
money, and must have known
where to find it,’ Head
postulated.

The fourth incident occurred
last weekend. As with the
Registrar theft, someone utiliz-
ed a master key to enter the
maintenance building and stole
five rolls of wallpaper and one
box of wallpaper paste, valued
at $130. Murray does not think
that the two “master-key”
thefts were related.

pathetic and-inspired support
from John Hicks on piano, Fred
Hopkins on bass and Steve Mc-
Call on drums...The band’s
sound is seamless; the musi-
cians sound as if they have been
playing together for years,
rather than just one recording
date.

Sparks fly on 4s of Yet, a
hard-bop tune which swings
ruthlessly. Hicks and Blythe
deliver the two hottest solos of
the album on this cut. And
Hopkins and McCall, best

known for their work with the
avant-garde group Air, explode
the myth that free players can’t
swing. Another outstanding per-
formance by the quartet is My
Son Ra, which is as mellow as 4s
of Yet is hot, without losing any
emotional impact. Blythe opens
‘ine song ‘by soloing over a
meterless drone which is
reminiscent of middle-period
Coltrane. The group then swit-
ches into a sweet ballad in 7/4
time.

The accompanying group is
superb throughout, the piano of
Bill Potts being a particular
delight. Perhaps the success of
this album is due to, the sen-
sitivity between the musicians;
Potts quickly adapts to Young’s
ideas, and bassist Willie
Williams complements _ both
well. Drummer Jim Lucht
plays with a firm steadiness,
and he kicks home the up-tempo
numbers with a_ powerfully
stomping bass drum. The
cumulative effect is that Young
is obviously in comfortable sur-
roundings, and this leads to
some of his finest soloing of the
50s, comparable even to the
remarkable sessions of that
period with Oscar Peterson and

It has become fashionable in
some quarters to suggest that
Lester Young’s post WWII work
pales in comparison to his work
with Count Basie and others in
an earlier period. Certainly it
can be said that the racial
harassment and incarceration
for possession of marijuana
Young received while in service
scarred him, and his post-war
sound WAS different. Yet, in the
melancholy and romantic tone

he affected, Young’s genius
shines through just as brightly,
and his swing is no less power-
ful. Perhaps the value of
LESTER YOUNG IN
WASHINGTON D.C. 1956 is that
it will silence the critics of this
man who shaped and influenced
the future of jazz music more
than any other artist. Lester
Young was rightfully called
“The Pres’; this album is a
powerful reminder of that.

duce an album which has a
chance to be moderately
popular without sacrificing
musical quality. As Blythe says
in the liner notes, ‘‘(The music)
should be accessible to each
listener on a thematic level, but
still maintain a consistence of
not being repetitive.’’ Arthur
Blythe is far too creative to ever
become repetitive. And his
Illusions will hopefully enjoy
some commercial success, for
it is one of the best jazz albums
of the year.

Stolen

A student who parked his

meone broke into _ his

George Weatherly says he

find his car stereo equipment
missing.

Missing from Weatherly’s
truck are a Pioneer AM-FM

amp and a pair of two-way
speakers.

“The thief had to take a lot of
time, the amp was concealed,”’
said Weatherly.

that the majority of fraternity
houses need major renovation
and “‘the problem of structural
damage is as great across the
board.’”’ “‘It’s not completely
our fault, buildings, especially
fraternity houses, don’t last
forever,’’ said Briscoe.

Briscoe sees the Report as an
important signal from the
University, ‘‘the University is
fed up, we’ve been lax in our

wasted money lent to us’’ but
Briscoe insists he sees ‘“‘a

Briscoe believes the key to
the survival of W&L’s fraternity

and a more responsible attitude
toward their Lexington
neighbors.

“It’s definitely a sink or swim
situation for fraternities, but
I’m convinced that if we show

Soccer Team Hands

MWC 2-0 Setback

by Mark Schramm

If Head Soccer Coach Rolf
Piranian was concerned about
the lack of offensive punch ex-
hibited by his front line.during
three consecutive pre-season
losses, in which his troops were
held scoreless, it didn’t show.

“The other teams had more
practice than we did,” Piranian
explained ‘‘We’ve had less than
a week to prepare for these
games and the men up front are
still feeling each other out.
They'll get it together by the
time the season rolls around.”

The coach’s words proved
prophetic as the Generals total-
ly dominated a strong Mary
Washington team by scoring a

that was not as close as the
score indicated.

Midfielder Bryan Williams,
who has shed all doubts about
his ability to return from a pre-
season ankle injury, opened the
scoring in the 14th minute of
play. After intercepting a
wayward pass, the MVP for the
past two years dribbled down
the left side, faked past two
defenders and unleashed a shot
from 35 yards out that ripped in-
to the back of the net.

Williams’ goal fired up his

Read it again: 28-14.

What looks like a simple

You see, the Generals won last

That’s right, 28-14.

those are Division I teams —the

At Washington and Lee, a

blessing from heaven. That’s
why Saturday was such a big
deal. While rolling to their se-

{4 Generals Dump Wasps As

Cavalline Runs For 149

by Dale Park

For the first time in its last
seven meetings against the
Emory & Henry Wasps, the
Washington and Lee varsity
football team came away win-
ners with a convincing 28-14 vic-
tory.

The win lifted the Generals to
a 2-1 record, their best start
since 1973.

‘The offense is really beginn-
ing to gel,” said head coach
Gary Fallon. ‘‘We used Chris
Cavalline (sophomore tailback)
effectively, but when E&H look-
ed for him we were able to
counter with Jim Wenke (junior
quarterback) running the ball.”’

Cavalline and Wenke combin-
ed for 222 of the Generals’ 253
yards on the ground. Cavalline
rushed for 149 yards on 35 car-
ries, while Wenke picked up 72
yards on 15 attempts.

In addition, Wenke contri-
buted 68 more yards through
the air, including a crucial 33
yarder to junior tight end Mike
Fogarty. The pass set up a W&L
touchdown dive by Cavalline
late in the second quarter.

Both offensively and defen-
sively, the first three quarters
belonged to the Generals.
W&L’s first possession of the
game turned into a sixty yard
drive that took eight minutes
and fourteen plays and was cap-
ped by a one-yard Wenke touch-
down run,

Two possessions later the
Generals made it 14-0 as
Cavalline dove into the endzone
to ice a long, second quarter
drive,

“Yet,” said Fallon, “the un-
sung hero of the day was Lee
Minetree (senior fullback).

‘All afternoon Lee threw the
crucial blocks that sprung
Cavalline.’’

Rich Hachenburg (junior
quarterback) entered the game
to replace Wenke only minutes
into the second half. Explained
Fallon: ‘I want to keep both
Hachenburg and Wenke sharp,
and by putting Rich into the
game and keeping the pressure
on him, I know I have him later
if I need him.”

fourth quarter by _ sending
Cavalline over the top for his
third touchdown plunge of the
day.

While the offense remained
consistent, several lapses in the
Generals’ pass defense allowed
the Wasps completions, leading
to two fourth quarter Emory &
Henry touchdowns.

‘They are a good bunch of hit-
ters,’ said Fallon, ‘‘yet
sometimes they get so keyed up
that they tend to go after the
man rather than the ball.”

The Wasps gained 195 yards
through the air, compared to
the Generals’ 93.

Pass defense will be a big con-
cern of the Generals as they
take on Centre College away
next Saturday. Commented
Fallon: ‘Centre has a big, 6’3’’
quarterback who can throw the
ball and throws a lot. They also
have a good defense and will be
very tough on their home field.”’

Last year W&L shocked the
Colonels in Lexington by the
score of 14-10.

Generals Dunk Hopkins
In Water Polo Opener

by Dave Johnson

The W&L water polo team
successfully opened its 1980
season Sunday with an 18-9 vic-
tory over Johns Hopkins. The
home opener provided an ex-
citing offensive show for the few
spectators able to arouse
themselves for Sunday morning
action.

Johns. Hopkins opened the
scoring in the first minute of the
game with a quick, fast-break
goal. Hopkins immediately
followed up with another score
which put the Blue Jays in the
lead, 2-0, after only 1:27 of the
game.

W&L called for a time out in
order for coach Page Remillard
to make some timely comments
on his team’s defensive play

Preview:

and the Generals came back
with three quick goals to take
the lead. The first period ended
with W&L up by a score of 5-3.

After the big'scare of the first
quarter, the Generals settled
down and began to dominate the
game. Working with a fast pac-
ed offense and strong shooting,
W&L built an almost insur-
mountable lead by the time the
second half got underway.

The third period opened with
another temporary defensive
lapse as Hopkins once again
scored two quick goals, but the
Generals soon regained their
form and rapidly put the game
out of reach.

W&L’s scoring was very
balanced, with team captain
Mike Bernot on top with five

goals. He was followed closely
by two-freshmen, Don ‘“‘Shark”’
Smith and Rand McClain, with
four and three goals, respec-
tively. Also having good offen-
sive days were Bob Marshall
and Tim Rock, each scoring
twice on two attempts.

Coach Remillard was pleased
with his team’s play, but had
important reservations. The
defensive play was spotty and
at times the Generals seemed to
grow complacent and rely sole-
ly on their offense.

Remillard was disappointed
in the defensive play and feels
that a much stronger effort will
be necessary in subsequent
games.

This year’s team does show
great promise, however. There

Cross-Country Team Looks Balanced

by John Harrison

Balance, a_ characteristic
which past teams have sorely
lacked, will be the strongest
asset of the. 1980 Washington
and Lee cross country team.

Whereas in past seasons
Coach Dick Miller has had to re-
ly heavily on one or two run-
ners, this year’s team will pro-
bably not have any members
that stand out. Instead, about
half of its fourteen members ap-
pear to be capable of giving bet-
ter than average performances
each and every week.

As Coach Miller puts’ it,
“From what I have seen in
practice, I’d say there are about
six guys I can count on to do
fairly well. I have been par-
ticularly impressed by three
freshmen. There is a balance on
this team that I haven’t had in
quite a few years.”

   

Co-Captains Howard Herndon
and Charles Warner are the on-
ly returning seniors on the
squad. Other returning up-
perclassmen are sophomores
David Dallam, Ted Fletcher,
Howard Gill, Jonathan Helfant,
William Langhorne, Mark
Smith, Todd Smith and junior
Greg Branan. Rounding out the
team are freshmen Bill Benson,
Chris Coigne, Lars Keeley, and
Angus McBryde.

The season will open this
Saturday, September 27, in
Fredericksburg. Mary Wash-
ington will be hosting the
Generals, as -well as
Washington College and Divi-
sion I George Washington.

Coach Miller is reluctant to
make any predictions. His only
comment is that this is just the
third year that Mary Washing-

The outlook for the Generals
in the ODAC this season is, at
this point, difficult to predict.
The potential for a strong team
is definitely there, but just how
well that potential is used and
reflected in the standings is
anybody’s guess.

Fall Tennis Program
Opens In Annapolis

by Phil Murray

Washington and Lee opens its
1980 Fall Tennis program this
weekend at the sixth annual
Navy Invitational.

The tournament should be a
good test for the 1980-81 team
which must fill the gaps left by
the graduation of three four-
year lettermen: Co-Captains
Stewart Jackson and David
Constine and top doubles player
Pat Norris.

Coach Gary Franke remains
optimistic about this year’s
team which includes four let-
termen with varsity singles ex-
perience. Leading the Generals
are senior Co-Captains Petes
Lovell and Doug Gaker.

Lovell played in two and three
positions last year, finishing
with a 6-12 record, only one win
shy of the team’s 7-12 mark in
1980. Gaker, playing in the
number five slot, had a fine 9-8
record,

In addition, Lovell
distinguished himself in the
ODAC tournament with a Ist
place in the number two spot.

Sophomore Steve Denny
returns to the squad this year
after a solid performance of 10-8
in the sixth position last year.
Rounding out the top four is
junior Wes Younge.

While Younge did not play
singles in any of last year’s

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Time For Action

During the past week the Washington and Lee Com-
munity has witnessed several disturbing acts of
violence. More than a few people have been attacked
and Lexington Police are investigating what could be
the town’s first rape in over a decade. We have
already seen that it is not safe to walk the streets
alone past midnight, but there have been incidents
where fairly large groups were attacked. One has to
wonder if Lexington is receiving the type and amount
of protection it seems to need.

Upperclassmen cannot help but remember and con-
trast the events of the past week with the quiet Lex-
ington they first encountered a few short years ago.
For many the charm of historic Lexington may have
been a factor in the decision to move to Lexington or
go to W&L The futures of Lexington and W&L are
intertwined. We should all be concerned about any
crime or violence in Lexington.

Yet students can find little solace in the knowledge
that local police seem more concerned with issuing
parking tickets and noise ordinance violations than
dealing with actual crime. The same night on which a
freshman was brutally assualted, the police issued
three noise ordinance summons and a variety of war-
nings. On the same night police found a visitor to Lex-
ington unconscious, with an eight-inch gash on his
head. He had been beaten up. Yes, there were several
incidents, and the police did not see one of thein.

Do we have to wait for violence to hit someone on
city council before we see the police spend some time
and effort preventing real crime and less on minor
matters such as parking tickets? We certainly hope
not. The W&L community should offer its cooperation
in hope that the local police will mount an effective
campaign to stop violence before it starts.

Ticket him... he‘s expired

by Jed Dunn

It seems that in this new academic season, the
Virginia Commonwealth authorities continue to
enforce two separate policies of ‘‘justice’’ — one
for local residents and another for college stu-
dents. Selective enforcement of both traffic laws
and alcoholic beverage laws was evident this past
weekend. For example, undercover plainclothes
control officers harassed students for consuming
beer in the back seat of a parked car while local
residents openly drank beer and shouted obscen-
ities from the top of the Robert E. Lee Hotel porch.
Are we to believe that only Washington and Lee
students are susceptible to intoxication? Or liable
under the law? Doubtless many of you have seen
disgusting winos hanging out on the streets but let
one W&L student drink a beer in sight of the road
and what happens?

Further — this small town of Lexington should
be safe enough to stroll about in at night without
fear of being hurt. But again the Lexington police
seem to enforce a double standard policy. While
W&L students are sometimes arrested for walking
down the street at night (it really happened), rov-
ing bands of local youth rampage unchecked, liter-

ally terrorizing students and their dates. It is un-
safe to walk from the campus at night because of
these street gangs. The disturbing fact is that
these gangs have repeatedly mugged W&L stu-
dents over the past two years and the Lexington
police have taken no visible action to protect
responsible citizens. On any night can be found
clusters of these youth strategically hanging out
on Main Street and the Nelson Street Bridge, un-
questioned by police officers — but let a house
stereo play past midnight and what happens?
Notice please the summoning of three fraternity
presidents this weekend for nebulous “‘noise’’ vio-
lations while one student was violently beaten up
just fifty yards from one of those same fraternity
houses.

Students in Lexington have had enough of the
double standard. The time has come for fair and
equitable enforcement of the law. Protection from
the marauding youths must be demanded of the
Lexington police. No longer should these unsuper-
vised delinquents terrorize any citizen who wishes
to walk at night. Perhaps W&L and the Lexington
police can work together so that a safe environ-
ment can exist. But first, consistent enforcement
of the law must be a reality.

Stop Sending Trash!

pear W&L Students,

 

 

Even if I didn’t know what
time of year it is, I can tell you
are back in town and starting
classes again. Your presence is
apparent by litter everywhere
— paper cups, empty beer cans,
smashed bottles, discarded six-
pack containers.

First thing I had to do Satur-

day morning (September 13th)
was Clean up the debris that had
been dropped in front of and
around our office building.

I do think it would be most fit-
ting if a city “nuisance” tax
was levied upon each of you to
help finance the retrieval of lit-
ter which accompanies you.

Criticism Of Frat Maintenance Plans

Dear Editor:

We would like to voice our ob-
jections to the University’s new
maintenance plan for frater-
nities. From what we’ve heard
of this program, it seems to be
ill considered and hastily im-
plemented.

First of all, the committee
which recommended this action
included only one fraternity
member. We fail to see how one
member of a single fraternity
can possibly speak for the sixty
percent of the student body
which belong to one of seven-
teen fraternities.

Secondly, we do not under-
stand why the program was im-

plemented last summer before
most students, alumni, and
faculty members knew about it.
It seems that the administra-
tion did not see any reason to
give these vital members of the
Washington and Lee communi-
ty a chance to respond while the
program was in the planning
stages.

Finally, we cannot see any
reason for the administration to
give the I.F.C. member the
dead option of accepting the
program or losing recognition

of his fraternity by the Univer-
sity. If the administration has
the legal power to force this pro-
gram on the fraternities, it
should be done openly. To put
the program under the charade
of student self-government
poses a danger to what little we
have left.

We hope that some member
of the administration can
publicly clear up these objec-
tions so that we all may rest a
little easier.

Spectator At Sea (on the fraternal slaver)

By official decree of His Royal Highness, The Golden Ale lies in
port for extensive overhauls. Once the pride of the royal yachting
flotilla, this fine ship has been severely punished by the Inner Fleet
Council. For ’tis only three days before the west winds pick up, and
the fleet rushes off in search of young savages and new slaves. The
Golden Ale is beaten; she will miss the winds. The great Greek
himself could not accomplish the list of labors that awaits her
motley crew. Yet I spy a flurry of activity aboard, and the cry, “all
hands on deck”’ rings out. Great gators alive, there’s the bastard
Captain High.

—This ship doesn’t look too bad, now, does it, Matey? Our stately
white masts may be cracking and listing alee, our hull may be cav-
ing in some, but sure as snow in Columbia, we shall cast off in time
for the slave rush. Slap a little plaster around here, and she’ll look
as good as new.

—Aye, aye, sir.

—Get on with it then, you lazy scad, you good-for-nothing
sophomore. Hand me that bottle, too, or I'll have you drawn and
postered all over the Seminary. Where are the bootblacks,
anyway?

—Yah call’d, mastah, sah?

—On your knees when you approach, foul pledge; where are your |

manners, your pride, your sense of Fraternal tradition? Vile Ebony
— I loath the sight of your kind. Away before you spoil the sweet
aroma of my bourbon nectar. Hi-hu — what have we here? A royal
messenger...good tidings or bad?

—I fear they are bad, Captain High, sir. The King’s Inter Fleet
Council has instructed me to inform you of a 2,800 drachma tax to
be levied immediately ‘‘on all yachts and pleasure boats in need of
small repair and for which said tax will be ruinous.”’

—Ruinous, indeed. Oh, Hated Hill...Odious officials... Murderous
Meddlers. We shall fight, fight, fight! Never in all my drunken days
has my buzz been so heavy, my high so low. My sojourn to Ber-
muda, my grain parches, the slave rush all lost in one foul blow.
Call the accountant, call my broker, swab the decks. Oh mommy,
mommy dearest...I fear I shall faint.

Later, in his oak panelled study, Captain High listens to the
trusted council of his social chairman first-class, one Jack Black
Daniels.

—Aye, sir, take a hit off this here, and ponder this if you will. We
have full fodder: four hundred stone of hog, seventy-seven barrels
of ale, nine coils of hemp, a ton of munchies, and one soul tape. We
could set sail tomorrow and snare all the virgins in Amazon. Witha
little luck, the right wind, and a little dancing, you'll have a fine
rush, sir. I predict twenty new slaves before the first, or may I live
to join them on Hell Night.

—Small comfort, gentle Jack. What of the repairs, the decree, the
odious tax? We will founder, surely. Yet you give me courage,
hope. Let us pray for foul weather and great snows to strand the
fleet and deplete their coffers. Ah, here cometh the ship manager,
perhaps he’ll bring us new cheer. What news of the labors, Junior
Joint?

—The holes are patched, the masts aright, and the hull glistens
with fresh paint. Yet I fear the plumbing, sir. The head is overflow-
ing and the cook complains of it. The lower decks are flooded, too,
so I’ve boarded all up. The crew grumbles when they hang-ten to
the sea, but take no notice. The Royal Council enjoyed the musty
odor. The decree is lifted!

—Great omens! Great Greeks! Set the sails! Fire the bongs!
Raise the bottle! Raise the anchor, AHOY...full speed ahead (to be
continued).

other times in the last six years

In gaining win number two,
the Generals unleashed two new
stars to the gridiron. While their
names are familiar to anyone
who has followed this team the
last two years, the exploits of
Jim Wenke and Chris Cavalline
have seldom been as apparent
as they were last Saturday.

Running the offense was
Wenke, one of the three men on
last year’s quarterback roller-
coaster and one of the two men
embroiled in this year’s
quarterback enigma. For the
moment, Jim Wenke appears to
be the definitive quarterback.
All he did was run for 72 yards
(averaging almost five yards a
carry), pass for 68 yards (con-
necting on 55 percent of his
throws), and directed his team
to 21 first-half points.

Playing basically half of the
game, Wenke was able to pro-
duce over 250 yards of offense.
That adds up to somewhere
near 500 yards for the entire
game.

But don’t get the impression
that Wenke was the only factor
in the win. Take away the per-
formance of the Generals’ new
tailback, Chris Cavalline, and
W&L would have been without

Now you can understand the

day. If Emory & Henry moved

to roll out, Cavalline usually
ended up busting through the
