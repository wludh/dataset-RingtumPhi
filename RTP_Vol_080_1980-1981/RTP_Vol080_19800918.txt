Frat Maintenance Plan Unveiled

by Mike Perry

University officials met with
fraternity presidents and
treasurers Tuesday evening to
explain and discuss implemen-
tation of a new system whereby
the University will perform
maintenance services and pro-
vide bookeeping aid to
Washington and Lee’s 17 frater-
nities.

Dean of Fraternity Affairs
Dan Murphy explained that the
creation of the program grew
out of the recommendations in a
report by a special ad hoc com-
mittee on Fraternity Financial
Relations. The committee was
comprised of administration,
faculty members and last
year’s Interfraternity Council
President Syd Farrar.

Murphy indicated that the
need for such a program came
in response to the report’s con-
tention that fraternities have
problems obtaining satisfactory
maintenance services and need
a clearer understanding of
where they stand financially
from month to month.

The program is certain to be
adopted by the IFC because as
University President Robert

Huntley stated in a letter to all
fraternity presidents, “failure
to participate will mean
withdrawl of the University’s
recognition of’? any non-
complying fraternity.

Murphy went on to explain
that in an effort to make the
costs of the program ($2800)
“more palatable,” fraternities
obligated by University loan re-
quirements to set aside $3000 in
a reserve maintenance fund
will be permitted to divert pay-
ment of this year’s sum toward
the costs of the program, and
that efforts would be made to
alleviate any financial strains
placed on other fraternities not
receiving University loans.

Superintendent of Building
and Grounds Jim Arthur ex-
plained that he conducted an in-
spection of all but one fraternity
and designed the maintenance
program. Under Arthur’s plan,
each fraternity will be billed
$2800 for the year and will be
visited by a plumber and elec-
trician at least once a week.

Fraternities may call on one
or two additional Buildings and
Grounds staff members to
make repairs with the excep-

tion of ice makers,
refrigerators and other
household appliances. Arthur
also noted that fraternities
would pay for what he termede
‘“‘major repairs,”’ following con-
sultation with house officials,
and any supplies over $10 in-
stalled during a particular visit.

Under the provisions of the
maintenance program, fire ex-
tinguishers will also be refilled
at wholesale cost by the
Buildings and Grounds Depart-
ment.

University Treasurer E.
Stewart Epley outlined a finan-
cial services program in which
each fraternity will be required
to submit ‘‘a simple financial
statement,” or any similar na-
tional fraternity report, on a
monthly basis to the University.
Epley reported that the Univer-
sity has contracted a book-
keeper, the accountant to the
fraternities through the IFC, to
assist fraternities in the
preparation of these reports.

Epley emphasized that Miss
Lowery will no longer be
available to prepare other
reports such as state and
federal tax returns on behalf of

EC Sets Guidelines

by W. Cope Moyers

The Executive Committee
Monday night approved two
motions and issued a three-page
memorandum designed to
maintaining proper relations
between itself and the many
campus subcommittees.

At its first meeting of the new
academic year, the committee
issued its memorandum to all
subcommittees outlining its ex-

pectations concerning this
year’s budget requests and
monthly reports.

E.C. President Bob Willis
said in the memorandum that
the committee will not accept
budgets or requests for student
body funds unless the subcom-
mittees follow guidelines
established by the Executive
Committee.

panied by the amounts re-
quested and received by each
committee during the past two
years and a detailed account of
the final year-end expenditures
and assets for 1979-80.

The Executive Committee
will also require each subcom-
mittee to submit written month-
ly reports on its activities. In-
cluded in the monthly reports
are a report of recent activities
and planned activities; a cur-
rent financial statement and,
according to the memorandum,
“a concise, detailed financial
statement on specific events.’’

In addition to the memoran-
dum, the Executive Committee
passed two motions exerting
more control over subcom-
mittee appointments of
freshmen and first-year law
students.

The first motion passed re-
quires subcommittee chairmen
to appear before the Executive
Committee on September 29
and explain their policies on the
selection of freshmen and new
law students.

charged to each fraternity for
this service.

Epley also annouced that the
University is in the process of
developing a manual to assist
fraternity treasurers that
should be available by the first
week of next year.

Fraternity representatives

voiced concern over the origin
of the $2800 maintenance figure.

Dining Hall Wins Awards

Both awards were in the
category of residence hall din-
ing, one for W&L’s regular
residence hall menus and one
for a special-event menu.

Though many students are
quick to criticize the food in the
dining hall, compared to food
services at other universities
the Washington and Lee dining
hall stands up well.

Gerald J. Darrell,
Washington and Lee’s director
of food services, received two of
four first-place awards this
summer in a menu exchange
contest sponsored by the Na-
tional Association of College
and University Food Services.

It was the first time that
Washington and Lee entered the
National Competition which in-
cludes some of the largest
universities in the nation.

Chi Psi Renovates Ann Smith

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s newest social fraternity,
Chi Psi, has moved into its new
home in the former Ann Smith
School building located at the
corner of Nelson Street and Lee
Avenue. The structure houses
all of Chi Psi’s 20 members as
they gear up for this fall’s
fraternity rush.

Chi Psi’s. national head-
quarters has already chipped in

The award for regular
residence hall meals was based
on menus submitted from
Evans Dining Hall’s standard
four week cycle. The special-
event menu was based on a
Chinese Lantern Festival din-
ner celebrating the first full
moon of the Year of the Monkey
in March.

An authentic Chinese meal
was prepared by Evans Hall’s
Chef Charles Dunn with
assistance in planning by Mrs.
I-Hsiung Ju, wife of W&L’s
artist-in-residence, and the din-

more than $100,000 toward the
renovation of the building and
the total costs are expected to
reach $250,000. Renovation on
the building’s second floor,
where most bedrooms are
located, is complete, but
renovation of the first floor is
only partially complete. Work
has not yet begun on the base-
ment. When all the renovation
work is completed, the fraterni-

ing hall was decorated with
Chinese lanterns.

But Darrell said he is more
pleased with the award for the
regular menu _ because _ it
reflects what the dining hall can
do.

Darrell competed against the
other 500-member institutions
of the association at its annual
conference in Washington D.C.
in July. Runners-up included
Oklahoma State University, the
University of Pennsylvania,
and Kansas State University.

Darrell has been director of
food services at Washington
and Lee since 1969 and is vice
president of the association’s
regional organization.

several large meeting rooms as
well as bedrooms as well as
bedrooms for 30 additonal
students, although the
timetable is still indefinite.

Like W&L’s other frater-
nities, Chi Psi will pay full city
taxes on the value of the
building itself, but will be ex-
empt from property taxes on
the fraternity’s land which is

Smith Wins NCAA Grant| News Briefs

Scott E. Smith, a four-year
football letterman at
Washington and Lee has been
awarded a $2000 NCAA post-
graduate scholarship. Smith is
the eighth W&L student athlete
and fifth football player to earn
the award, which was initiated
for the 1964-65 academic year.

“Scott has been an outstan-
ding leader at W&L on the foot-
ball field, in the classroom, and
around the University com-
munity,” stated W&L athletic
director and physical education
department chairman William
D, McHenry. “He is one of the
finest offensive lineman we
have had in recent years; he
has performed admirably as a
sergeant-major in our ROTC
program; and has done com-
mendable jobs as a University
Federation tutor and as a news
and sports commentator on the

The second motion gives the
Executive Committee power to
veto any new appointments to.
the various subcommittees.

‘We need to assure selection
of qualified persons,” Willis
said.

In an attempt to keep itself in-
formed of subcommittee ac-
tivities, the Executive Commit-
tee decided to have its members

Dean’s List recognition eight
times and Honor Roll recogni-
tion six times. He will use the
scholarship at McGill Universi-
ty, located in Montreal,
Canada.

A four-year starter at offen-
sive guard, Smith earned Old

second-team honors as a
sophomore and first-team
laurels as a junior and senior.
This past fall he served as team
captain along with classmates
Stewart Atkinson, Jr. and Syd
Farrar.

Marshall Clark will serve as

vention committee and Voting
Regulations Board.

Jeff Edwards was appointed
as an ad hoc member to the
Cold Check Committee, Tripp
Brower to Student Control and
Frank Smith on Contact. Jim
Vines was appointed to the
Publications Board.

“Scott’s performance as a
W&L football player was
outstanding,” said Gary Fallon,
head coach at W&L since 1978.
“He was an intense, conscien-
tious, and unselfish worker who
gave our younger players con-
fidence and encouragement.

“There’s no doubt in anyone’s
mind that the success and pro-
gress we’ve had here at W&L is
largely due to people like
Scott.”

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s seven other NCAA post-
graduate scholarship winners

Purvis Out

Life went on at Washington
and Lee this summer even
though the students were scat-
tered across the nation and
world.

One of the top news items was
a decision by the city of Lex-
ington to dismiss Lt. Jack Pur-
vis from the police force.

Purvis, according to a memo
released by the city, violated a
city code for law officials. He
was given an opportunity to
resign following a hearing but
did not do so. Instead he waited
to be dismissed.

‘Best SBA’

Over at the Law School, the
Student Bar Association was
named ‘Best SBA’ in the
United States by the law student
division of the American Bar
Association.

And, believe it or not, the
W&L law school paper, The
Law News, tied with the Univer-
sity of Virginia law newspaper
for the “‘best in the southeast”’
honors. The paper is published
by the SBA.

Warm, Shallow ‘Lagoon’

Columbia Pictures Presents a
Randal Kleiser Film
The Blue Lagoon
Starring Brooke Shields
Introducing Christopher Atkins

Director of Photography
Nestor Almendros
Screenplay by
Douglas Day Stewart
Produced and Directed by
Randal Kleiser

by John Wells

The Blue Lagoon, which is be-
ing held for an additional week
at the State Theatre, is a
moderately entertaining, well-
photographed fantasy which
deserves more notoriety for its
salacious publicity than for any
actual content.

The story, based on an an-
cient novel and filmed in 1949
with British actress Jean Sim-
mons, concerns two young
cousins shipwrecked at an early
age who grow to maturity and
eventually find ‘‘natural love”
onan exotic island.

Fifteen year-old Brooke
Shields, who gained fame as the
bawdyhouse child in Louis
Malle’s Pretty Baby is found to
display more modesty in her
latest film. In those scenes re-
quiring her to go topless, the
young star wears hair pasted to
her cleavage which creates a
kind of immobile hairdo in
storms and underwater. Any
scene exhibiting more flesh
than television would permit is
filled by Miss Shields’ 33 year-
old double, These scenes are not
difficult to detect.

Some of the films most
humorous sequences deal with
the male star, a newcomer
named Christopher Atkins — as
he builds the two of them at hut
that puts the Swiss Family
Robinson to shame. The dwell-
ing, along with numerous items
saved and preserved from the
doomed voyage, actually brings
to mind the absurdities of
Gilligan!s Island. One half ex-
pects to see Atkins driving a
thatched car about, or Shields
pushing around a bamboo shop-
ping cart (ala Ginger and Mary
Anne) looking for food.

But now wait a_ minute,
there’s a plot here somewhere
—I think. Actually, what it boils
down to is this — they grow up
and discover natives on the
island and have spats and make
up and he discovers his
manliness before she discovers
he womanliness and he wants to
but she doesn’t and then they
have a big fight but then they
both, mutually and
simultaneously discover
‘natural love.”’

Brooke Shields is admittedly
the most beautiful child star
since Elizabeth Taylor in the
mid-1040’s. Without a studio to
guide her career (Liz had M-G-
M), Miss Shields has found
herself in several films which
have clicked neither critically
nor commercially (Just You
and Me, Kid, Wanda Nevada,
etc.) Lagoon affords her
beautiful camera angles and a
showcase for her untrained and
unremarkable — but certainly

Freshman Guide

 

not bad — talent. She comes
across as less stuck-up than her
Calvin Klein commercials
would indicate. And she sure
does look nice!

Christopher Atkins seems to
have taken the whole thing
more seriously — perhaps a bit
too seriously — than his co-star,
but comes across well in a scene
or two. Particularly after he
has thrown his natural bride’s
belongings from the second
floor balcony window of their
grass roof beach estate and
subsequently apologizes.

Since the dialogue is carried
on between two uneducated
adolescents who have more or
less raised themselves in an
adult-free world, the screenplay
is not of a scintillating nature.
Lacking the professional exper-
tise to effectively counter this

deficiency, the young stars are -

ultimately disappointing in
crucial scenes (of which there
are relatively few).

The entire production is
beautifully photographed, with
bright, colorful beaches, coral
and fish, and, certainly, the at-
tractive couple themselves who
always look perfect. This is a
light, reasonably diverting
entertainment which contains
sex, scenes which may tend to
disappoint: The ‘‘plot’’ is sus-
tained chiefly through occa-
sional shots of the stars’ (and
double’s) glowing bodies, and
ever-watching tropical wild life.
In fact, the animals appear to
be having a better time observ-
ing than we do.

Film Notes

Casino Royale (Great Britain, 1967) — Producer Charles K.
Feldman thought it would be a neat idea to make an all-star James
Bond movie, with a bunch of swell directors thrown in to do what
they do best. The resulting chaos is brought to us this weekend by
the SAB. The extraordinary cast includes Peter Sellers, David
Niven, Woody Allen (who co-wrote), Ursula Andress, William
Holden, Deborah Kerr, Orson Welles (who, in 1967, had not reached
his current dimensions), George Raft, Joanna Pettet and Terence
Cooper among others. The principal director (and the best known)
is John Huston. The result is intermittently funny, but you may
have noticed they never tried to do it like this again. Presented by
the SAB, Friday through Sunday, September 19-21, at 7 and 9 p.m.
in duPont Auditorium. Admission is $1.

 

 

NOTICE — The SAB will hold its first meeting tonight (Thursday)

at 7:00, in which a proposal to move the Fancy Dress Ball from Fri-

day to Saturday night will be discussed. The meeting is open to the

student body and we encourage any student input. We are located
in room 208 in the University Center.

ON THE ROAD : RANDOLPH-MACON

_/ sone who is willing to risk
life and limb on the 40-mile road
to Lynchburg might also be
willing to make a stop at
Randolph-Macon Woman’s Col-
lege. Affectionately called
‘“‘Randy-Mac”’ by a few of its
students, some of Lexington’s
Minks have been known to call
it the ‘‘Nunnery”’ and its women
“Macon bacon’’; one alum from
the class of 1923 says in his day
it was called ‘“‘Randolph’s Col-
lege for Makin Women.”

In any event, freshmen who
give in to a ‘‘Randy-Mac at-
tack”’’ will find a picturesque
college located on 100 acres just
inside Lynchburg. There are
pines house parties and the Dell
for warm weather outdoor par-
ties and Smith Hall for mixers.
The outside parties are usually
good but the Smith Hall parties
are crowded and beer runs
short. You can expect to pay
three dollars at the door and a

quarter a beer, if youcan get to ~

it while it lasts.

 

Dating Macon girls, or
women as they prefer to be call-
ed, can be interesting and a real
challenge. Macon’s security is
tight and seems to constrict
more each year, strongly con-
tributing to the monastic im-
age. Males must be accom-
panied by females when in the
dorms and unengaged_ up-
perclasswomen are quick to see
that underclasswomen do not
get all the dates and that males
do not freely roam the halls.

However, should you decide
to try your hand at roaming the
halls at Macon, there are two
good tricks. One is to head for
the bathroom in the main hall:
Once you are past the first
check point, sprint up the spiral
stairs and try to look in-
conspicuous. If that manuever
fails, try the fire escapes, but
don’t get caught! Security at
Macon warns us. that
trespassers will be dealt with
harshly. toa

By this time chances are you
have been thrown out of the
dorms and driven out of town.
But if you have not been run out
of town, you will probably want
to take your Macon date
somewhere beside the Macon
campus, and fortunately there
are some good night spots
around Lynchburg. The Sow’s
Ear provides excellent enter-
tainment, and several good
bars which occasionally feature
live music are on the other side
of town. Should all else fail, you
can go to Lynchburg College.

And when the night is done
and you have taken your date
back to the Main Hall fortress,
you will probably want a bite to
eat. The best late night snack
can be found at the Texas Inn.
Just ask for the Cheesey
Western, all the way. If you
don’t get killed in the parking
lot, the Texas Inn can be a great
place to stop before heading
back over the mountain-to.Lex:

the first Washington and Lee
baseball player named to an
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference all-league team, has
gained another first for the
Generals.

Ellis has been named to the
American Association of
Baseball Coaches NCAA Divi-
sion III third team, marking the
first time a W&L player has
received recognition from the
AABC. Ellis, who plays center-
field for W&L, is one of 11
players on the third team and
one of 33 recognized by the
Association.

Ellis started in all 18 games

W&L, VMI

If at first you succeed, then by
all means do it again.

In October 1979, the W&L golf
Generals joined forces with
their counterparts across town

this season to earn his second
varsity letter. He paced the
Generals with a .393 batting
average and 24 hits, and also
batted in eight runs as the
Generals compiled a_ 5-13
overall record and a 5-7 ODAC
mark.

“Thad did an exceptional job
in all phases of the game and
richly deserves the All-
American honor,’ comments
W&L head coach Chuck Kroll on
his team captain. ‘‘He handled
his responsibilities well as team
leader; he improved his batting
average by 60 points this spring
over his freshman season and
he kept base runners from scor-
ing with his accurate throwing.

“A further impressive note

about Thad is that he’s still im-
proving,” Kroll adds. ‘He
knows he hasn’t reached his top
form and won’t be satisfied un-
til he does. We expect him to be
even better next spring.”’

“He’s a super individual, a
super athlete, and a super guy
to coach,” concludes Kroll, who
this spring completed his se-

‘cond year at the Generals’

helm.

Ellis, who as a freshman also
led W&L in batting with a .329
average, played this summer
for the Waynesboro ‘“‘Generals”’
of the Shenandoah Valley
League. Next spring he will join
senior Tommy Coates as cap-
tain of the W&L squad.

men, the university said. There
were 1,413 applications for ad-
mission — the highest number
since 1966 and a 30 percent in-

The Washington and Lee var-
sity football team ended a seven
year opening game drought
with an impressive 12-8 come-
from-behind victory over the
Delaware Valley College Ag-
gies.

The Generals not only won
their first opening game since
defeating Hamilton College 29-7
in 1973, but avenged last year’s
30-0 loss at the hands of
Delaware Valley.

“We've come a long way
since last year’s 30-0 loss,”’ said
Head Coach Gary Fallon, now
in his third year. ‘Personality
wise, this is a very confident
team.”

Ten minutes into the game,
Delaware Valley blocked a

W&L punt attempt and
recovered the ball in the
Generals’ endzone to give the
Aggies a quick 8-0 lead.

W&L cut the lead to 8-6 late in
the second period as tight end
Jim Stanley recovered
sophomore tailback Chris
Cavalline’s fumble in
Delaware’s endzone.

Tailback is a new position for
Cavalline, who battled with
both Jim Wenke and Rich
Hachenburg for the starting
quarterback position last year.
Explains Fallon: “By moving

Cavalline to tailback we have
acquired a triple threat. He can

not only run and pass, but we
can also use him in quick-kick
situations.”

The Cavalline move is part of
Fallon’s plan to open up the of-
fense. W&L won the Delaware

For All Armchair Quarterbacks,
Verdict Still Out on Generals

by Bill Whalen

And so after two weeks of this
young football season, we still
have to sit back and withhold
any judgment on this year’s
W&L squad. The main reason is
that the Generals have played
two games and given two dif-
ferent types of performances.
The team that opened in Lex-
ington was, hopefully, a
preview of the future. The team
that played last Saturday in
Gettysburg was a reminder of
the dark past.

At this point, it would be too
easy to say that the Generals
were lousy last Saturday. It
would also be unfair. One has to
remember that this is still a
young team and, when you're
away from home, young and in
trouble, things have a way of
going from good to bad to worse
in a matter of minutes. Last
Saturday in Gettysburg, the
Generals went through that

type of cycle.

So if you’re still trying to
figure out what this team is
capable of, this Saturday’s
game will serve as a good
benchmark. Last year, the
Generals lost to Emory &
Henry, 12-6, in a game they.
could have won, probably
should have won, but didn’t.
Such a game is typical of the
way football has been in this
town over the past few years.

If the Generals are for real,
then we should be able to tell
after this week’s contest. Over
the past four years, W&L has
lost to E&H by margins of six
points, seven points and twice
by one point. If W&L has made
it over the hump of losing this
year, then a defeat of this type
of nuisance would serve as
strong evidence.

But win or lose, the Generals
have joined the ranks of
countless other football teams
in the adoption of a team gim-
mick. Look around the NFL,

and you'll find that most teams
have some type of nickname or
habit which a small group of
players have started. I suppose
this began a few years ago with
the Oakland Raiders and their
black towels, but now the habit
has spread to Lexington.

I’m referring, of course, to
the ‘‘Bald Eagles,’’ a group of
players who decided to shave
their heads. You may be repuls-
ed at the thought of this, but
don’t forget: these stints usual-
ly work. Remember the
Georgia Bulldogs of 1976? They
too shaved their heads, called
themselves the ‘Junkyard
Dogs’’ and went on to defeat
Alabama and go to the Sugar
Bowl (where they lost to No. 1
Pittsburgh). Anyway, it worked
for Georgia, maybe it can also
work for the Generals.

A little team spirit never hurt
anyone, especially in this in-
stance.

C

Chris Cavalline carries the ball around right end, following the block on Chip Forte (No. 64) and Andy

a

then raced 55 yards down the
sideline for the score.

Although the Aggies mounted
a late drive moving to the W&L
one-yard line, the Generals
made a goal line stand and, on
third and goal, recovered a bob-
bled snap to ice the victory.

Last Saturday the Gettysburg
Bullets evened the Generals’
record at 1-1, trouncing W&L
28-0.

Said Fallon: ‘‘We simply fac-
ed a better team offensively in
Gettysburg. We thought we had
the right game plan and stuck
with it, but they caught us with

. alot of misdirection plays.”’

The second quarter was
disastrous for W&L as_ the
Bullets scored three quick
touchdowns. The last Get-
tysburg score came on a 51 yard
drive late in the fourth quarter.

Cavalline led W&L’s rushing
effort for the second time in two
games, gaining 73 yards on 19
carries.

Overall, says Fallon, ‘‘the
team is looking ahead with con-
fidence. The defense is playing
as a cohesive unit and is made
up of several third year
Starters’? (such as Mike
Pressler, Dave Nichols and
Tommy Noble).

This Saturday the Generals
will take on Emory & Henry at
home in W&L’s first ODAC
game of the season. Fallon
describes E&H as a “scrappy,
hungry team that always gives
us a tough time.”

In last year’s meeting Emory
& Henry held off a W&L come-
back to win 12-6. Game-time is
1:30 at Wilson Field.

One of the first RE-ELECT PRESIDENT CARTER commercials
broadcast since Labor Day took place on September 3 at 10:55 p.m.,
following a T.V. movie on C.B.S. The ad, portions of which were in-
cluded in a film shown at the Democratic National Convention this
summer, seeks to portray the Chief Executive as a strong, sensitive
leader in an unstable world.

Gerald Rafshoon knows what to say and what not to say in a slick
package which looks pretty but which apparently is not aimed at
the thoughtful, intelligent voter. Since such voters were not crucial
in squeaking Jimmy over the top in 1976, these tactics are
understandable. The Carters have lived in the White House for
three and one-half years now, and Rafshoon has more impressive
footage for commercial use — a sharp contrast to the previous
campaign ads which relied heavily on colorful panoramas of fruit
trees and county fairs with spurts of country music lest we forget
Jimmy was from Plains.

In 1980 we see a presidential-looking Carter waving from
airplane ramps and discussing obviously important stuff with Jody
Powell inside a moving limosine. An anonymous, rather solid-
sounding voice tells how the president has become such a world
figure in recent years (this might come as a surprise to Mr.
Carter’s predecessors).

Against a background of symphonic music we see: the
Commander-in-Chief conferring with various world leaders; a
sober-faced Carter, in tails yet, laying a wreath at the grave of
Japanese Prime Minister O’Hira; the inevitable footage of the
Camp David Accord Hand Clasp (a clip which will undoubtedly be
yellow and grainy by election day). We are told by the narrator how
sensitive and intelligent the President is; so wonderful is. Jimmy
that he can carry on a “cordial” relationship with the Pope, and
still deal with the leaders of Communist China. Such awesome
public figures as the Vice-President, Sen. Inouye of Hawaii, and Lt.
Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York extoll His domestic awareness,
prowess in foreign affairs, and sheer brilliance, respectively. The
effort is to make Jimmy Carter look presidential.

Such an effort may also be found within the White House in
manipulating the President’s activities, and, indeed the govern-
ment, for political purposes.

The Republican National Chairman, Bill Brock, charged on
September 11 that Carter has abused the powers of incumbency in

 

Campaigning Carter Style

the current campaign. According to the Washington Post, the
R.N.C. is “filling 29 Freedom of Information Act requests with
government agencies for details of travel and public appearances”
by administration officials.

What about Carter’s media-staged events, which surpass any
charge against Ronald Reagan for playing ‘‘cheap politics’’?

A conspicuous example is the recent flutter of belated Medal of
Honor presentations since August. Before the Democratic conven-
tion, Carter was seen on national television with a World War II
veteran whose request for recognition had been lost somewhere in
the bureaucracy. Until it was suddenly found, so Jimmy could
make a dramatic presentation, embrace the obviously moved reci-
pient, and turn to the camera just in time to wipe an apparent tear
from his right eye.

And just last Friday yet another belated medal was bestowed
with many tears and hugs, this time upon an Italian-American
veteran in a Rose Garden ceremony which also marked the an-
nouncement of credit guarantees for Poland. This allowed Jimmy
to look human as well as presidential on the front page and grab a
few ethnic votes as well.

In a special report written earlier this year, Chief of Staff
Hamilton Jordan noted that President Ford had not used the in-
cumbancy to its fullest potential during the 1976 campaign. No such
charges can be leveled against Carter. He has used public funds for
countless “‘nonpolitical’’ White House briefings for ‘‘community
leaders.’’ Until law took effect this month requiring the campaign
funds pay for campaign travel, Rosalynn Carter hauled Air Force
One all over the country for single appearances. Her husband did
the same after world matters became more ‘‘manageable”’ last
spring and, the nomination sewed up, he left his crises in the oval
office. Now a smaller, less expensive military plane is used for
political trips.

Using cabinet secretaries to politicize their offices is a low tactic:
appealing to voter sympathy by turning a sacred honor into a cheap
photo opportunity sinks lower still. These methods are becoming a
hallmark of the President’s campaign, which seeks to highlight the
candidate as a man of the highest personal character.

Council Tuesday evening and outlined a maintenance ArT
program it thinks will get and keep fraternities in of ea
shape. Though the program will cost each house near- a y ay

8

' ly $3,000, it will more than pay for itself in the long
run. And the Administration has made a genuine and
sincere effort to, in the words of Dean Murphy, make
the “program more palatable.” In truth, the idea of
regular low-cost maintenance may be the saving
grace for the fraternity system.

The only problem with the whole scheme is the way
fraternities were handed the package. Most fraterni-
ty members read about the plan in the paper when
they got back to Lexington and house presidents
received a letter about the program this summer. But
on the whole, the program came as an unbudgeted
surprise and as a result caused no small amount of
resentment. In his inaugural speech, President
Huntley stressed the fact at Washington and Lee the
students and faculty entrusted with the largest
measure of freedom and choice possible. Yet the
President announced that any fraternities not com- ese : .
plying with the maintenance problem would no longer Fraternities e An endang ered species ?
be recognized by the University. That sounds like an
offer the Godfather could hardly turn down.

 

We think the program is a good one and will be a
great benefit to fraternities especially in the long run.
If the administration had pursued a more reasonable
strategy the maintenance program would have
received the kind of positive response it deserves.

Four score and seven days ago, I returned to the Hallowed Hill
for Studly Sons of Confederate Heroes. My urge to matriculate
quickly faded, for Little Mary’s School for Art-History Majors and
Aspiring Brides stirred within me a greater interest. This son also
rises. With a dedicated fraternity bro (John), I packed two prospec-
tive pledges, a case of Bud, and other essentials in my once fine
now trashed road mobile. As usual, I had blown off the C-School,
but what the hell...there’s a lot you can do with a 2.2 when you join
the family bank. The Ax has rusted in his shower, anyway.

The ride to Little Mary’s went well enough. After three years of
crossing the mountain, I knew the curves as well as my third score
five days ago. The freshman were quiet and scared by my apparent
ignorance of hairpin turns, so I tried to start some typically boring
conversation. As it turned out, one of the guys was bid material, but
his roommate played chess all summer and told me he really en-
joyed the the boiler Room Tour. Ball...

We made it through the three security checkpoints and arrived at
the mixer in the Rackcellar. Foamy 10* beer abounded and the
freshmen approached the bar in search of liquid courage. John and
I weren t too psyched by the soul tapes or pastels, but were amused
to see Boris Spasky grab three beers and wander up to some prime
potential. These young innocents giggled as Boris stumbled for an
opening line; “Ah, ehem, ah, d-d-do you d-d-d-drink beer?” Beer
dripped on his feet as he puffed up his shoulders with new-found
confidence. The responding chorus of southern laughter caught the
crowd's attention, John turned to me and said, ‘Man, this is too
much! Let’s cruise the dorms.’’ Another round of howls went as we
left the mixer. Boris had fallen and lay in a puddle. I wondered
who'd give him a ride back.

I found some action on fourth floor Sunker, and John said he’d go
check out some other dorms. The Allman Brothers were cranking
on the stereo down the hall; I’d brought the essentials, and things
were pretty cool. One girl had two jugs of Gallo and I couldn't
resist. We got to talking and she told me that she was an art major
and enjoyed raising caterpillars as a hobby. That sounded too good
to be true and I replied, “Really? This summer I worked on a tuna
trawler and caught tons.”’ She really dug that program.

I told her she was cute, special — even asked her if she was a
senior. But she wanted to hear “I love you.’’ Searching my vast
vocabulary for the right response, I thought, “Bummer, I can’t
handle these aspiring wives...or can I?”’ I fell silent and decided to
play it cool for a while. But she kept insisting: ‘Tell meh yah luv
meh..,.tale meh.”’ This airhead was getting to be too much, but by
the time we had finished the bottle of wine, I figured — go for it. I
didn’t want to lie to her, so I leaned over and drooled, ‘‘Ich
liebedich”’ (stud).

The next morning, I saw John and the freshman faceman munch-
ing happily on cantaloupes in the dining hall. We shot the bull and
decided that we had better head on home. As we were leaving town
I couldn’t believe my eyes. There was Boris thumbing for a ride
and looking like a Cheesy Western outside the Texas Tavern.

Five scores and eight days ago...

Plan Unveiled

(continued from page 1)

Dean Murphy said _ the
University is prepared to invest
‘$60,000 of its own’”’ funds in this
year’s operation of the
maintenance program.

Sigma Chi treasurer Robert
Neely criticized the Universi-
ty’s maintenance program’s
policy of billing all fraternities
the same cost, claiming that
this kind of ‘bad attitude’’
might prompt fraternities to
overuse the program as long as
they must pay a uniform price
regardless of service actually
received.

Dean John explained that all
fraternities will be required to
pay a uniform cost of $2800 to
“help defray startup costs’”’ and
that all costs will be reviewed in
December in hope of adjusting
fees so as to reflect actual use of
the service in the future.

Pi Kappa Phi representitive
Dutch Waldbauer complained
that his fraternity has already
lost ‘12,000 down the drain”’ on
inadequate repairs done in their
bathroom and asked if the
University would be willing to
help fraternities locate compe-
tent contractors to perform
“major repairs.’’ Buildings and
Grounds Superintendent Jim
Arthur said fraternities would
be free to consult him or his of-
fice.

He also accepted Sigma
Alpha Epsilon President
Richard Salmon’s suggestion
that the University Buildings
and Grounds office assist

staff, citing an instance in
which a University Building
and Grounds employee had
done faulty repairs on the house
when contracted privately.

Arthur responded by saying
all employees will be supervis-
ed by foremen and will answer
to the Universtiy’s office of
Buildings and Grounds.

IFC President Monte Briscoe
believes ‘‘the meeting went well
and most fraternities had their
questions about the program
answered.”

Briscoe added that he thinks
the program ‘‘will benefit
fraternities, especially in the
long run.”

W&L Gifts Up

Unrestricted gifts toward
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s day-to-day operating ex-
penses exceeded $1 million in
the year just ended, and addi-
tional records were set in the
size of the average gift, $177,
and in the numbers of gifts at
both the $100 and $1,000 levels.

Gifts through W&L’s annual
fund totaled $1,045,076 as of the
end of June, according to Carter
B. McNeese; associate develop-
ment director who is in charge
of annual giving programs. The
figure reflects an increase of 8.5
percent over last year’s unre-
stricted gift-income total of
$984,203.

In calculating annual-fund
gifts, Washington and Lee
counts only money actually
received by June 30 and in-
cludes no contributions that
carried restrictions or which
went into endowment or toward
other permanent puposes.

The average annual-fund gift,
$177, was up from the previous
year’s $170.

The number of $1,000-and-
above gifts was 319, up from 309
the year before,

Unrestricted income to W&L
through the annual giving fund
has more than doubled in six
years.

Golf Tournament

(continued from page 9)

nout and exciting finish (the
University of Virginia edged
Virginia Tech on the second
hold of a sudden-death play-
off), the teams will host the 36-
hole event again this fall. Play
is scheduled for September
20-21 on the Lexington course.

“It appears we;ve got a fine
annual tournament here,”’
reports Buck Leslie, who this
fall enters his seventh year as
W&L’s coach. ‘So far, we’ve
got every team back from last
year’s tournament and we’re
hoping to enlist a few more
schools.”

The Generals finished eighth
among all teams in the 1979 In-
vitational and’ second among

NCAA Division III] members in
the event.

“Having so many fine Divi-
sion I teams competing: makes
ita tough event for any school to
win,” offers Leslie. ‘‘We like to
think that with a home course
advantage and with some fine
players, W&L will challenge for
both team and _ individual
honors in future Invitationals.”’

Generals whom Leslie ex-
pects will strive for honors this
fall include junior and co-
captain Bill Alfano, classmates
Jim Kaplan, Titus Harris and
sophomore Bert Ponder. These
men helped W&L compile a 13-1
dual match record during Spr-
ing 1980.
