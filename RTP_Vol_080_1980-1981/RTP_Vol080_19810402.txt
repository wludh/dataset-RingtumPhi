Election Procedures Criticized

by W. Cope Moyers

Led by defeated sophomore
incumbent Pete Baumgaertner,
the Executive Committee Mon-
day night strongly criticized
procedures governing last
week’s student body elections.

Baumgaertner, who lost his
seat on the committee to John
Vilahoplus and incumbent
Frank Smith, expressed
dissatisfaction that polls were
not manned, election publicity
was unsatisfactory, campaign
violations were committed and
confusion was prevalent during
the general election and Thurs-
day runoffs.

Baumgaertner suggested that

the Executive Committee in-
vestigate ways in which elec-
tion procedures might be im-
proved in the future and agreed
to form an ad-hoc committee
with EC law representative Jeff
Edwards, the Voting Regula-
tions Board and_ several
members of the student body.

Executive Committee Presi-
dent Bob Willis agreed with
Baumgaertner, saying that the
elections ‘‘just weren’t run
right.’’ He also reminded the
committee that efforts in the
past to correct similar pro-
blems have not had impressive
results.

Two members of the commit-

Posters Attempt

To ‘Dump Smith’

by Todd Smith

“Dump Smith” read posters
placed extensively across the
main campus after dark on
Tuesday of last week.
Sophomore Executive Commit-
tee Representative Frank
Smith had just qualified for the
Thursday run-off for the two
Junior E C_ positions.

Smith was later reelected,
gathering 81 votes (more than
any of his opponents). The
posters were almost completely
removed by mid-Thursday. ‘‘I
took down four or five before I
realized I had no right to in-
terfere with someone else’s free
expression,” said Smith.

According to the anonymous
posters, it was ‘‘obvious”’ that
the sophomore class had the
‘poorest representatives.”’ The
University Printing Center pro-
duced 150 of the posters on
Tuesday afternoon.

The Printing Center called
EC Vice-President Willie
Mackie for advice on whether to

print the posters. Mackie
recommended the printing on
the basis that the EC had no
power of prior constraint
against free expression. ‘‘I told
the center to go ahead unless
the posters violated some norm
of taste,’’ said Mackie. He
reasoned that the posters could
be hand-made, anyway.

Frank ‘Smith said he received
an anonymous phone call at
3:45 a.m. on Wednesday morn-
ing warning him that the
posters had gone up.

“T have reason to believe,”’
said Mackie, “‘that the people
who put up the posters were ac-
ting in response to exaggera-

tions and misleading
statements on Frank Smith’s
posters.”

One of the unsigned posters
said ‘Smith Stinks” and asked
what he had ever done, and
what idea he ever had. Smith’s
poster had claimed that he
“was at work to change the

tee, junior Eric Myers and
senior Jim Vines, were
especially critical of the elec-
tions. Myers complained that
there were more campaign
rules violations this year than
ever before.

Vines told the committee of
an incident involving a
freshman candidate who lost
the election by less than ten
votes.

Vines said that the voting sta-
tion located in the freshman
quad, ‘‘one of the most strategic
polls as far as this candidate
was concerned,’’ actually ran
out of ballots in the afternoon.

But Voting Regulations Board
chairman Mike Drinkwater
defended the error, saying that
during the 30 minutes no ballots
were available, he told students
of other polling places. And
Drinkwater also said that only
one student showed up during
this time to vote.

Most committee members
were sympathetic to the main
problem encountered by the
VRB, which suffers from a
severe shortage of students
willing to watch the polling
places during the elections.

‘“‘We’ve been trying to recruit
people all year, but most just
think it’s a joke,’”’ Drinkwater
said.

Drinkwater also said that the
reason polls were not manned
all day during Thursday’s
runoff was due to the Phi Beta
Kappa ceremony, which altered
the usual class schedule.

In other business, Vines
reported on possible White Book
changes being considred by an
EC subcommittee.

Vines said that his subcom-
mittee will make its report to
the full committee on April 27,
at which time the EC will begin
discussion on whether to accept
the proposals.

W&L Beats Delaware,
Ends Losing Streak

by Rick Swagler

After dropping two games in
a row, one to North Carolina
State and another to Towson
State College, the Generals took
to Wilson Field yesterday and
beat the Delaware Blue Hens.
Going into the contest, the blue
cluckers were ranked number
thirteen in the national poll.

The Generals drew first blood
when Mike Schuler dashed
downfield and fired a quick,
shot. Both teams traded goals
throughout the game with
neither taking a decisive advan-
tage.

The fourth quarter proved to
be very fruitful for W&L as the
Generals scored four
unanswered goals before allow-
ing a Delaware goal with 4:42
remaining.

The final score did not reflect
the closeness of the game. Geoff
Brent commented that after
losses to Towson State and
North Carolina State, the
team’s “confidence had been
shaken,” and that the team
“thad doubts’’ about its ability to

come back. ‘‘I didn’t think we
should havelost the N.C. State
game, and it took us the Towson
game to get the ‘‘feel’’ back. It
paid off today though.”’

Senior midfielder George
Santos agreed with Brent, say-
ing, “The team is definitely
back of track, W&L is notorious
for coming back.’’ Santos con-
tinued, ‘‘A total team effort like
today’s helps you realize that if
the ball rolls by the goalie, it's
not necessarily all his fault."

Coach Jack Emmer was
“real happy”’ about the victory,
saying ‘‘we’ll take a win any
way we can get it.”” Emmer
echoed Brent’s sentiments say-
ing that the two losses shook the
team.

Emmer said he is looking for-
ward to the William and Mary
Contest of April 14 as a ‘‘con-
fidence builder,”’ adding ‘‘we
scheduled the game there for
that reason.”

Emmer emphasized the need
for fan support on the April 19
game against arch-enemy
University of Virginia.

 

by W. Cope Moyers

Mumblings of criticism and
expressions of disgust are
already circulating among
many of us who believe that
television’s coverage of Mon-
day afternoon’s incident in
Washington was distasteful, ir-
responsible and inaccurate. It
seems that each and every time
the television press informs the
public on important and often
fast-breaking news stories,
many are more interested in at-
tacking television instead of
praising it.

In the coming months,
\ Americans are going to be inun-

 

dated with scorecards and criti-
ques, debate and forums on how
well or poorly Dan Rather,
Frank Reynolds, Edwin
Newman and Roger Mudd took
control of the situation and fed
the public the fast breaking
story, one of the most important
events in American history in
the last 20 years. But before
jumping on the anti-news band-
wagon, there are a few aspects
of the drama the public should
bear in mind.

First, within nine minutes of
the shooting, ABC was interrup-
ting its regular programming to
inform its viewers that there

assassination. CBS followed
three minutes later, NBC 60
seconds after that. By 3 p.m., a
large percengtage of
Americans, those with the
largest stake in an event of such
magnitude, knew that
something significant and ex-
plosive had occurred involv-
ing the American government.
Thanks to the three networks,
the news was out and reaching
millions of Americans im-
mediately. Yet the critics will

conveniently forget this.
Second, although initial
reports said the President had
not been injured, this was not
the fault of the media. Such con-
fusion was not limited to the
networks, but prevailed at the
White House, which was caught
off-guard by the shooting and
initially was unprepared to shift
into overdrive. A White House
spokesman had at first said that
Reagan was unhurt and the net-
works went with the story as
told by the White House. Yet the
critics will conveniently forget
this, and assail the press .:as too
instantaneous in its coverage.

Third, the videotape of the
assassination attempt is
awesome. The camermen who
disregarded their own safety in
order to accurately record
events. will naturally receive
praise from the network heirar-
chy, but will most likely be
forgotten by the critics.

The opponents of television
news will instead focus on the
network’s running and rerun-
ning in slow motion and still
frame of the gruesome
shooting. What millions of us
Saw was certainly not pleasant.
It was real, it was vivid. Yet

From the perspective of more than three-quarters of a century,

published in 1932, elicited the following comments from reviewers:
“A distinct, unique note in modern poetry. A sort of blank verse
that seems to create a new brand of this form’’ (Contempo). ‘Lines
that are vibrant with melody and yet simultaneously place the em-
phasis upon scientific fact” (Portland Oregon Journal). ‘‘These
poems, apparently treating of complex subjects, are done with a
simplicity of expression which adds much to their beauty” (High
Point Enterprise). ““A superb work. Sanderson may rest assured

One on the Aisle:

A Fine, Evocative ‘Angel’

by M. Shaw Pyle

It was Saturday night at the
Troubador for the final perfor-
mance of Look Homeward,
Angel. Wouldn’t you know, we
finally get good weather for a
performance and — it’s SRO.
The ‘‘varsity’’ crowd was out in
full force, and we got our pre-
show kicks watching the Great
Seating Marathon as _ ticket-
holders engaged in nasty squab-
bling over seats. Apparently,
someone at the box office lost
track big time and there was a
Who concert-style free-for-all.
We must point out that the
Troubadour shoe-box —
whoops, we mean ‘‘theatre’’
is hardly suited for festival
seating. Director Al Gordon
tried frantically to straighten
things out, but to little avail: it
was like sending a priest to talk
lemmings down off the cliffs.

So, here we are, resembling
nothing so much as a tin of kip-
pered herrings. And, d’you
(figuratively, of course — you
know the Troub), no one no-
ticed. By which we mean, the
play was good. Very good. To
wit: the sets were evocative,
multi-purpose, well-
constructed, and most in-
novative: one could see the
whole boarding house, on
various levels and removes —
which contributed mightily to
dramatic flow. It was, however,
given the size of the stage, a bit
cramped — though nothing
compared with the audience, of
course. The lighting tended
towards extremes: utter
darkness or blazing glare. Part
of this may have been inten-
tional, but we are inclined to
ascribe most of it to the defi-

ciencies of the facilities at this

here renowned liberal arts in-
sty-tew-shun. The production

details (costuming, sound cues,
and so forth) were all neatly in
place (you never miss the water
till the well runs dry), and one
could concentrate on the perfor-
mance.

Actually, one could hardly
help doing so. The acting was
very much on the acceptable
side — except when it was bet-
ter than that. Frank Billingsley
turned in a fine performance as
Ben Gant, the small-town
newspaperman and _profes-
sional cynic, a workaholic set
for self-destruct (he’s been
watching John Billmyre again).
Laura de Maria’s Mrs. Pert was
simply adorable, as was Ginger
McNeese’s Miss Brown (a
return to her traditional casting
as a fluttery, small-time flirt —
a true Daughter of the Regi-
ment). Andy Butteg was
workmanlike as the _long-
suffering Hugh Barton, and
Beedle White and Rose Gordon
— well! As Helen Gant Barton
and Eliza Gant, they made
abundantly clear the root of the
difficulties facing the Gant
men. Kipling was right: certain
women should be struck
regularly, like gongs. Les Clark
has found his metier: it is hard
to infuse titanic motion into that
lanky frame, as those of us who
saw the ‘“‘comic”’ Pinter noted.
But, as the dyspeptic
moneyman Uncle Will
Pentland, Clark shone. Well,
glittered with a_ script-
promped dullness, at any rate.
As for Our Hero, the portriat of
the artist as a young whatnot,
Drew Perkins’ Gene Gant was

more than adequate, and, in
places, admirable. Bill Sherwin
was proficient in his role as the
disgusting Jake Clatt, and Pree
Ray was most acceptable-and
often hilarious — as his descript
and hostile mother. Shirley
Hughes hit pay dirt as the sex-
starved Florry Mangle, Greg
Glessner was pure Gall as the
{florid dance master Mr. Farrel,
‘and Scott Stanton handled
townie Tarkington perfectly
well. Paula Langdon was as
good as she could be as Laura
James, the Richmond belle with
whom our southern aesthetic
hero is smitten — but the script,
in attempting to make her a
symbol, leaves her forlornly on
the periphery. Richard Boaz’
W.O. Gant, the stonecutter with
artistic ambitions who becomes
obsessed with the stone angel of
the title to the point of isola-
tion from his family, achieved
almost mythic proportions. Ted
Petrides’ Luke Gant was well
crafted enough, and Earle
Greene’s Dr. McGuire was the
sort of GP we've been looking
for for some time. Finally — but
by no means insignificantly
—Marjorie Poindexter was fan-
tastic — but fantastic — in her
debut as the black madame,
Mme. Elizabeth. This critic
snickered himself sick. Kudos
to all the above.

In the final analysis, the play
was fine, while it lasted. But, as
Al Gordon points out, Eugene
Gant’s rite of passage to
maturity is one of many such in-
cidents in the literature: a
“universal theme.’’ Amen to
that. It’s a rich vein, but it’s get-
ting overworked even at that.
Oh, well, what do we know?

Record Slips To 4-8

by Dale Park

The Washington and Lee var-
sity tennis team brought its
overall record to 4-8 on the
season by winning two of five
matches in last week’s action.

On Tuesday, March 24, the
Generals lost to Division I VMI,
8-1. Senior co-captain Doug
Gaker took over at the number
one singles spot for the absent
Pete Lovell and provided the
Generals with their only win of
the day with an impressive 7-6,
3-6, 6-4 victory.

The following day, W&L got
back on track by clobbering
Division II Radford 8-1. The
Generals swept the top singles
flights and all three doubles
positions. Singles winners in-
cluded senior co-captain Lovell,
back again at the first flight;
Gaker at second singles;
sophomore Steve Denny at the
third position; junior Wes
Yonge at the fourth spot; and
freshman Scott Berman at fifth
singles.

In doubles, Lovell and Gaker
teamed up for a 7-5, 6-2 victory
at the first flight. Denny and
Yonge took the second position
with a 7-5, 2-6, 7-6 win, and Ber-
man teamed with classmate
Charles Kalocsay for a 7-5, 5-7,
6-0 triumph at third doubles.

The Generals made it two ina
row by pounding Division III
Greensboro 9-0 on March 26.
Significant in this match were
the performances by the
Generals’ two freshman
players, Berman and Kalocsay.

Berman breezed in his fifth
singles match, 6-4, 6-2, while
Kalocsay won easily at the sixth
spot, 6-3, 7-5. Both players
teamed at third singles for a 6-2,
6-1 romp.

W&L ended up this five-day
stretch by losing a pair of tough

9-0 matches to two talented
teams; the Generals bowed to
Division II Hampton Institute
on March 28 and Division I
Brown University the following
day.

Commenting on these two
teams, head coach Gary
Franke said, “Brown is an
outstanding team comprised of
mostly freshman and
sophomore performers. Hamp-
ton is still almost as good as
when they won the Division II
crown back in 1976, and they
have Six excellent foreign
players on their team.”

Beginning on April 13, the
Generals will begin a six-day
southern swing which includes
Emory University (April 13);
the University of Central
Florida (April 14); Rollins Col-
lege (April 15); Flagler College
(April 17); and the University
of Florida (April 18).

It was a long ride home Satur-
day, the Towson State Tigers
scored a decisive 19-11 victory
over W&L in lacrosse.

The Tigers scored two
straight goals at the end of the
first half, and left the field with
a 9-5 lead. In what appeared to
be the beginning of a second
half General rally, junior at-
tackman Mike Pressler scored,
bringing the total to 9-6.

However, the rally was short-
lived, as Towson scored four
unanswered goals. With the
score 13-6, Pressler again
scored twice. The Tigers
responded as they had before,
scoring five consecutive goals

and putting the game out of
reach.

Sophomore Geoff Wood, a
W&L attackman, scored 4 goals
and was credited with one

 

assist, helping him to earn the
W&L Player of the Game honor.
Pressler finished the game with
3 tallies and Rob Staugaitis
finished with one goal and four
assists.
Freshman Barry Waterman
commented, ‘Obviously we
weren’t pleased about the gang,
but is wasn’t an attitudinal pro-
blem.’’ He continued, ‘If we:
play our game, we can beat
anybody. N.C. State lured us in-
to playing their game.”’
Waterman said the team did
not seem to be bothered by the
latest USILA-Poll, in which
W&L was not ranked.

The next two weeks will be
crucial for W&L lacrosse. On
April 14, W&L will face William
and Mary at Wilson Field, and
on April 19, W&L will face their
toughest opponent of the year,

Towson Dumps Generals

the University of Virginia. If
W&L hopes to be chosen for the
NCAA playoffs, scheduled for
late May, they must turn the
season around.

A victory against William and
Mary would be a step in the
right direction, but of greater
importance would be a victory
over U.Va.

With U.Va. currently ranked
4 nationally, the lacrosse team
will encounter a_ situation
similar to that of the basketball
team in their game against
Roanoke. A victory would pro-
vide the opportunity for na-
tional recognition.

Although the game is schedul-
ed for the day before spring
term classes start, fan support
could turn the lacrosse team’s
season around.

 

Middle Rob Carpenter scoops up a ground ball in yesterday’s defeat of Deleware. The Generals evened
their record at 2-2 with yesterday’s win.

Golf ‘Blossoms’ With Weather

by Scott Mason
Now that spring has arrived
and weather conditions have
improved, so it seems that the
Washington and Lee golf team

has blossomed as well. Coming
off a wind and rain hampered
tournament of two weeks ago,

in which the Generals finished a

disappointing 13th, the team
around and
literally crushed Bridgewater

turned things

and Shepherd colleges in a

match played at the Lexington

Country Club course last week.

Furthering their undefeated

record of 3 and 0, the team is
performing well, according to
Coach Buck Leslie. In last
week’s match, W&L posted a
396 score to Bridgewater’s 445
and Shepherd’s 482. Several
players’ turned in impressive
scores on the 71-par course, in-
cluding Jim Kaplan’s 75, and
senior co-captain Gerry
Barousse’s 78. Steve Everett
chipped in with 79, Tom
Wohlfarth an 80, and junior co-
captain Bill Alfano with an 84.
The key, indicated Leslie, is
team balance. When one man

doesn’t perform well; the others
pick up the slack. Said Leslie,
“One guy picks up the other.”’

The Generals’ face
Bridgewater and Longwood to-
day, tbe toughest competition,
thus far in the season. “‘It will
be a good test today,’’ says an
optimistic Leslie, and with
superb weather conditions, the
team appears hopeful for
posting yet another couple of
wins.

The team will lay down their

clubs after today’s match for a
couple of weeks due to exams

and spring vacation, which,
comments Leslie, this could
prove to be a real handicap.
With the break, the team’s
momentum may be snapped,
and they will have to work hard
in regaining that tempo as the
season resumes. “‘It’s tough,”’
says Leslie, ‘‘but we’ve done it
before in the past.”’

Whether the Generals can
adequately maintain that tem-
po and prove equal to the test
will be revealed on the 17th and
18th of April when the team
travels to the Virginia Tech
‘Gobbler Classic.”

Baseball Team Loses Three of Last Four

by John Harrison
The W&L baseball team
finished its last week before ex-
ams by dropping three of four
games, as they fell below .500
for the first time this season.

The Generals returned to
Smith Field after splitting a
doubleheader at Randolph-
Macon last Tuesday. This was
the first game the Generals
have managed to take from the
Yellow Jackets since anyone
would care to admit.

An 0-5 Lock Haven St. (Pa.)
squad was the opposition last
Thursday, but the Bald Eagles
took an early lead against
starter Jim Halprin and went on
to claim their first victory. Lock
Haven scored in the first four
innings and held an 8-2 lead,
before coach Craig Jones called
in Jim Stanley to relieve
Halprin. Halprin was tagged for
three triples in the first inning,
and home runs by Chris Wilt in
the second and Ed Vaz in the
third.

After giving up three runs in
the fifth, Stanley settled down to
shut out Lock Haven for the
next three innings. He did allow
two unearned runs in the ninth.

While Stanley was nearly

perfect from the sixth to eighth |

innings, the Generals were
unable to do anything against

starter and winner Paul Haren-
char. W&L did score three
times in the fifth, but left the
bases loaded after Mike Walsh

 

 

Generals southpaw
game.

knocked in one run with a
sacrifice fly and Dave War-
renfeltz forced in another with a
walk. Warrenfeltz finished the

   
 

 

im Halprin

game with two RBI’s.

The rest of W&L’s offense was
provided by second baseman
Chris Cavalline, who went 4-5,
and rightfielder Don Dudley,
who had two singles and a walk.
Things didn’t get any better

     

through in an earlier

the next day when ODAC oppo-
nent Bridgewater took on the
Generals. W&L committed five.
errors, falling behind early

once again en route to a 13-3
loss. Junior Jim Brockelman
was a victim of the Generals’
porous fielding and his own in-
ability to throw strikes; five of
the nine runs he allowed
resulted from either walks, wild
pitches or his own errors.

Bridgewater’s Mark Puckett
showed why he made the ODAC
All Star team last year. The se-
cond baseman went 3-4 with 3
RBI’s, a walk, and a run scored.
Greg Maynard added 2 RBI’s
for the Eagles.

For the Generals, Cavalline
was 2-4 with a run scored, and
Walsh drove in a run. With
these exceptions, W&L couldn’t
do much more at the plate
against Tommy Thomas, who
pitched a complete game.

W&L split a doubleheader at
Maryville last Saturday.
junior Dave Randall was im-
pressive while throwing a
six-hit shutout in the first game.
Cavalline continued his hitting
tear by smacking a homer, and
Tom Coates had two hits in the

9-0 triumph. Rich Hachenburg
pitched almost as well as Ran-

dall, but received little offen-.

sive support as the Generals

dropped the second game, 3-1.
So, after the first month of the

season, the Generals’ record is
3-5 in the ODAC and 6-7 overall.

Some changes will be made in
the lineup when W&L returns to
action with home
doubleheaders against
Hampden-Sydney and Eastern
Mennonite on the 14th and 16th
of April. Hachenburg will be in
Germany taking part in a study
abroad program. Coach Jones
plans to move Dudley to his
place on the mound. Coach
Jones is hoping that Marty
Thomas will be fully recovered
from his elbow injury.

Jones expects that center-
fielder. Thad Ellis will raise his
average, to the .393 mark he at-
tained last year, when he was
named a third-team Division III
All-American. “It’s not that
Thad looks bad,”’ said Jones,
‘but he hasn’t looked super. He
still has a smooth stroke, and
the speed to help him catch a lot
of fly balls.”’ Finally, the coach
said that the two most consis-
tent performers so far have
been Randall, who leads the pit-
ching staff with 3 wins and three
complete games, and Cavalline,
who leads in doubles, triples,
and batting (.500). He has also
been pleased with the defensive
play of catcher Tripp Brower
and shortstop Jody Harris.

Track Team Splits Meets, Seven ODAC Marks Set

by Ralph Frasca

The Washington and Lee
track ream split two trimeets
held at W&L while setting seven
ODAC highs.

On Mar. 27, the Generals
defeated Newport News College
and ODAC rival Emory &
Henry. W&L was_ heavily
favored to win the meet, but
met stiff opposition from
Newport News, which scored 73
points to W&L’s 94. Emory &
Henry amasses only nine
points.

The Generals gave up some
points in the jumping events, as
one of their top jumpers was in-
jured. Russ Rector was sidelin-
ed with a pulled hamstring mus-

cle.
However, the W&L runners

turned in a superb perfor-
mance. Keith Kadesky
registered two of the six ODAC
top performances. He won the
100-meter dash in 11.36 seconds
and the 200-meter event in 23.19.
Jon Kelefant recorded a time of
16:31 in the 5000 meter run and
the W&L 440 relay team turned
in a 44.7 secind time.

ODAC standards were also
set in two other events. John
McKee captured the shot put
witha distance of 43 feet, two in-
ches and Alan Armitage posted
a 16:22 time in the 110-meter
hurdles.

‘‘We didn’t win the meet by as
great a margin as Coach
Aldridge thought,” Armitage
said.

On Mar. 31, W&L placed se-
cond in a tri-meet with
Christopher Newport and
Eastern Mennonite College.
CNC totaled 93 points to W&L’s
69. Mennonite placed a distant
third with 19 points.

“Christopher Newport beat
us in the sprint and distance
running events,’ Armitage
said. ‘“We were simply outclass-
ed.”

W&L’s Gene Fellin turned in
the ODAC high in the pole vault,
attaining a height of 12 feet.

Due to school regulations pro-
hibiting team practices for this
weekend and exam week, the
track team must endure a one-
and-a half layoff, a concern of
any coach. Lhe Generals’ next

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Election Follies

Last week’s elections for important student govern-
ment positions were a disgrace, and the Executive
Committee as well as the Voting Regulations Board
are responsible for a debacle that will hopefully be
remedied in the future.

One poll ran out of ballots, possibly costing a
freshman candidate his chance for election. Polls
were not manned the entire time, leading even the
casual observer to speculate as to the accuracy of the
election. Campaign posters were torn down, too many
were put up by several candidates, some in apart-
ment buildings blocks from the campus, and as junior
EC member Eric Myers observed, there were more
violations of campaign rules this year than ever
before.

Of the Executive Committee’s many respon-

sibilities, one of its more important jobs is to ensure
that the VRB does its job. The VRB complains that too
few students actively participate in its activities —
and the EC agrees. But what it really comes down to
is the fact that at least for the moment, both are sear-
ching for a way to put this issue on the back burner.

At Monday night’s meeting, sophomore EC
member Pete Baumgaertner volunteered to take a
closer look at this problem. When he asked for
assistance from other members, not one offered to
help. Only after nervous laughter and excuses from
most of the ten EC members did Jeff Edwards agree
to aid Baumgaertner. It is unfortunate the EC does

not believe the issue as crucial as it really is.

The problem can only become more acute in the
future unless action is taken now. The present Ex-
ecutive Committee has shown that it can tackle any
problem it chooses — if it wants to. Best we believe
that next year may be too late. Now is the time to act.
Drastic steps are needed in order to correct serious
defects in the election process at Washington and Lee.

Let’s hope the EC thinks so too.

Latture Award

Omicron Delta Kappa is now
accepting nominations for the
Rupert M. Latture Outstanding
Sophomore Award. The award,
established this year, is named
after the long time Washington
and Lee Professor and Ad-
ministrator who is a founding
member of Omicron Delta Kap-
pa.
The award recipient, to be
chosen by a committee of ODK
faculty and student members,
will be the sophomore who most
exemplifies ODK ideals. While
academic excellence will be a
major factor in the selection
process, other considerations
will include extent of extracur-
ricular interests, demonstra-
tion of leadership ability and
potential, and strength of in-
dividual character.

Nominations are due April 10
and should be delivered,in
writing, to Mr. Taylor Sanders
in Washington Hall. The award
committee will consider accom-
panying written material sup-
porting the nomination. Ques-
tions concerning the award
should be addressed to Mr.
-Sanders or to Sam Flax, ext.
245.

Correction

It was incorrectly reported
last week that three university
security men are currently
patrolling the campus and other
university property.

According to a letter from
Dean Lewis John, the number is
actually ten. These include Bob

one man at the athletic center
and six watchmen.

At the urging of a number of
students in the W&L communi-
ty, we are writing this to ex-
press our concern over the pro-
posed closing of the record
store. Although the record store
offers a share of current
popular music, it’s the only
place within the area which
makes available a selection of
alternative music such as jazz,
classical, folk, and imported
rock artists.

We feel that the service the
record store provides is essen-
tis] to the cultural environment
of the W&L community. A very
large amount of money current-
ly goes to pay for live entertain-
ment and social events many of
which students are not able to
attend or would even prefer not
!.0 attend. The record store per-
mits anyone to make his or her
own choices concerning music.
Of course, music available
through the store can also
enhance the experience gained
through a school sponsored
musical event.

Beyond the students, faculty,
and townspeople who make per-
sonal use of the record store, it

quality of programming in all
musical areas.

We are dismayed with the
manner in which the decision to
close the record store was
reached. We feel the issue
should have first been brought
before the community and
discussed prior to any final
decisions which you seem to
have made. Alternative pro-
posals for the successful opera-
tion of the record store do not
seek to have been given ade-
quate emphasis.

We believe .that altering
operating operating procedures
to achieve break-even status is
preferable to closing the store,
and even if the store continued
to incur a small deficit under a
more efficient operation, we
feel the use of student and/or
University funds to support the
store would be worthwhile.

Music is indeed an essential
element of a liberal arts educa-
tion. We urge the administra-
tion and the student body to ac-
tively push to keep this precious
resource flowing. and to recon-
sider their decision to close the
record store.

said something they shouldn’t
have. But it wasn’t the press.
The television audience,
which grew as the afternoon
progressed, got a good and ac-
curate look inside the
newsrooms of three of the most
expensive, comprehensive
news gathering machines in the
world. What one sees on the
evening news is the finished
product. The hard work, tur-
moil, decision-making and com-
plexities of reporting the news
is what few ever see. Reporting
the news isn’t easy, but it is im-

portant. Monday was no excep-
tion, nor was it basically dif-
ferent than what occurs every
day of the year.

The press, especially the net-
works, should be applauded for
the exceptional job they did.
Not only did they gather, inter-
pret and report the news quick-
ly and accurately, but they have
learned some lessons should the
inevitable occur again. Let’s
hope they don’t have to apply
these valuable experiences to
report a similar story in the
future.
