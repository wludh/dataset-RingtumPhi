Regulations Set For

Washington and Lee University

October Elections

by Cope Moyers

Rules and regulations govern-
ing student body elections were
presented to the Executive
Committee by the Voting Regu-
lations Board in Monday night’s
E.C. meeting.

The board presented a six-
teen-point plan, which will
serve as a guideline for the pro-
cedure to be followed in the Oc-
tober 20th election of the fresh-
man Class’s president and vice-
president, executive committee
representative, and university
council members. The plan also
applies to the election of the
first-year law E.C. represen-
tative.

The E.C. failed to reach a
definite conclusion over the
number of votes needed to win
an election, however. Although
the student body constitution
states that a candidate must
collect more than 50 percent of
the votes, several committee
members questioned what ac-

  

tually constitutes a majority.

EC President Bob Willis ask-
ed if the number of ballots cast
or the number of votes cast
should be counted toward deter-
mining the majority. After a
lengthy discussion, the commit-
tee decided to discuss the issue
at a later date, agreeing that
the issue more than likely will
not be a problem in the election.

On October 20, students will
be able to vote in front of the
library or at the law school
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Candi-
dates are prohibited from ver-
bal or physical contact with
potential voters within 25 feet of
the polling locations and cannot
place banners or posters within
ten feet of the area.

The VRB also set limits on the
amount of money each can-
didate can spend. The VRB also
required all candidates to at-
tend the EC’s next meeting on
Monday, Oct. 13. Petitions are

Renovations on Graham-Lees Dormitories will have freshmen living two to a room and cause campus-

wide relocation of upperclassmen.

Renovation To Cause Relocations

by Ed Gonsalves

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity will begin extensive
renovation of Graham-Lees
Dormitory on June 1, 1981 and
expects the work to be com-
pleted by September of 1982.

The University, in order to
house all the displaced fresh-
men, will use Davis Dormitory,
Baker Dormitory, one of the
Lee houses and three floors of
the Robert E. Lee hotel. All
freshmen will be two to a room.

Upperclassmen who want
University housing will have
the College Inn available to
them in addition to Woods
Creek Apartments and Lee

House II. “To help with the
relocation impact, upper-
classmen are currently being
interviewed to get some feed-
back on the matter,” cites
Frank Parsons, assistant to the
President...

Male law students will have
first priority for rooms in
Davidson Park, while female
law students have first priority
for rooms in Woods Creek
Apartments. Like the fresh-
men, unmarried law students
will live two to a room in David-
son Park unless they choose to
live with more.

Married law students will still

be allowed to live in Davidson

SAB Rejects SABU Proposal

by Frank Billingsley

A proposal to appoint a
representative from the Student
Association for Black Unity to
the Student Activities Board
failed 25-0-2 at an SAB meeting
Sunday night.

Co-Chairman Jamie Small,
who cast one of the two absten-
tions, proposed the motion at
the suggestion of SABU Secre-
tary Mark Smith. Smith, who is
also Head of Public Relations
for SABU, said he made the sug-

Park, but those rooms occupied
by married law students who
graduate this spring will not be
re-rented. Instead, they will be
used to house upperclassmen or
unmarried male law students.
Parsons says, ‘‘We will not
force anybody out of their
apartment. We do not wish to
create any undue hardship.”
‘We cannot guarantee that
everybody will be totally
satisfied,’’ continues Parsons,

“but there are viable housing

options available.”’ ,
If it is determined that the

University has not provided
enough housing to satisfy the

gestion because he felt that
‘““SABU had been apart from the
mainstream of social and ex-
tracurricular activities on cam-
pus, for reasons unresolved.”
Smith said, ‘‘SABU is trying
to make a greater effort to con-
tribute to the social and ex-
tracurricular life at W&L and
we felt the SAB could serve as
one of the vehicles for this.”’
Co-Chairman Pryse Elam,
voting against the motion, said,
“The members of SABU had

ample time to apply for a
member-at-large position on
the SAB and none of them did.
SABU will not be given any
special consideration that
wouldn’t be given to anyone
else.”’ Small also noted that
Smith approached him before
the deadline to apply for ap-
pointments this fall.
Responding to this, Smith
said, “I grant them we didn’t
follow the normal procedure for

Student Hit By Car

by John Ran Smith

A Washington and Lee stu-
dent was struck by a car early
Sunday morning in an incident
which occurred on the Hollins
College campus.

Garic Moran, a W&L fresh-
man, was standing in front of
the Hollins apartments around 1
a.m. when a Hollins student lost
control of her car and ran into
the yard, struck Moran, crash-
ed into another car parked
below and hit a brick wall.

The car knocked Moran ap-
proximately 20 feet, where he
landed on his hands and feet.

“It knocked me about six feet
up into the air and I did a double
flip,” said Moran. “I never
knew I was an acrobat before
that.”

Moran was then taken by am-
bulance to the Roanoke Com-
munity Hospital where he was
treated for a cut on his face, a
knee injury and released.

Moran said he is not pressing
charges, but that the Hollins
sophomore, whom he refused to
name, is to pay for the medical
bills involved with the accident.
No one else was injured.

Other news from the police
beat includes a pair of thefts.

Robert N. Joyce Jr., a law
student, reported October 1 to
the Lexington Police Depart-
ment that an estimated $200 to

$300 worth of goods was stolen
from his car while it was parked
in the upper law school parking
lot.

According to the police re-
port, an AM/FM cassette
player, about twenty cassettes,
and a pair of Nike shoes were
stolen from the car between
9:30 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. last
Wednesday. ; ‘

Edward J. Bedford, also a
law student, reported a silver
car cover was taken off his 1957
Triumph TR3 while it was park-
ed in the lower W&L lot on
Saturday. The estimated value
of the cover is $40 to $50.

WE&L Students Have Low Loan Default Rate

by Dave DeHay
Less than 10 percent of
Washington and Lee students
are presently in default on
NDSL educational loans, accor-
ding to Michael Bartini, Direc-
tor of Financial Aid.

‘We don’t have an_ un-
favorable default rate,”’ said
Bartini. “‘The rate is below 10
percent, which is acceptable by
the standards of the National
Direct Student Loan Program
(NDSLP). The default figures
for Guaranteed Student Loans
are not “generated for the
financial aid’ Bartini added.

Under the NDSL program,
the individual university

operates the loan, which is
sponsored by the _ federal
government on an 8/9 basis.
The university supplies 1/9 of
the loan.

The loan is to be paid back in
a maximum of 10 years, start-
ing nine months after the stu-
dent graduates, at a three per-
cent interest rate. Under-
graduate students may borrow
up to $5,000 in four years, not to
exceed $2,500 in the first two
years.

NDSLP loans are based on
need, and are extended to 100 to
120 students at W&L, at an
average of $1,100 per loan, ac-
cording to Bartini.

Tuition Increases

By 9.5 Percent

by Tom Baker
Just like everything else, the
cost of going to school is going
up. Washington and Lee
students now pay $4,050 for tui-
tion — a 9.5 percent increase in
last year’s tuition.

E. Stewart Epley, the univer- .

sity treasurer, cited inflation
and the failure of the Capital
Fund Campaign as the two
reasons for tuition increases at
W&L. The Capital fund did not
raise the amount of money that

it was supposed to within the
period that the campaign was
most active.

On a more positive note,
Epley pointed out several in-
stances in wnich the university
has saved or made better use of
its money. Epley and Louis
Snyder, the assistant treasurer,
have improved the Short Term
Cash Management System, the
university short term in-
vestments, to produce an added
$450,000 for the school budget.

The university also dug a well
to provide water for the air con-
ditioning system and put a com-
puter in the power plant to
monitor heating and cooling in
the newer buildings.

According to Epley, despite
all the cost increases, the
university has not had to cut
back on services or staff.

Finally, to add to everyone’s
concerns about higher prices,
the W&L board of trustees will,
in November, probably approve

another increase that will put
next year’s tuition at $4,800.

The GSLP accounts for about
$1 million in loans extended to
650 W&L undergrads. These
loans are not based on need, so
any full time student is eligible,
but the interest rate is higher
(seven percent).

Under the program, the stu-
dent’s bank or other lending in-
stitution operates the loan,
which can amount to-a max-
imum of $7,500 for under-
graduate work. The govern-
ment pays seven percent in-
terest on the loan while the stu-
dent is in college, and after
graduation the loan is paid back
in the same manner as the
NDSL.

Bartini noted that the interest
rates and maximum amounts of
these loans will change in 1981,
because of legislative  re-
authorization of the programs.
The exact nature of these
changes will be detailed in the
next issue of the Ring-tum Phi.

Concern over the default rate
on these loans has prompted the
government to take steps to im-
prove and standardize collec-
tion procedures, stated Bartini.

‘When the government built
the programs, it planned for a
revolving fund, wherein the
money paid back for loans
would then be loaned out
again,” Bartini said.

Bartini added that when the
national default rate on the
loans climbed to an unaccep-
table rate, there was talk of the
legislature wanting to scrap the
whole program and rebuild it,
but it was later decided to im-
prove the existing programs
and collection procedures.

Bartini pointed out that con-
trolling defaults on NDSLP
loans is important because in
the past the government has cut
back funds to the program due
to larger numbers of defaults.

W&L subcontracts collection
and billing agencies to assist in
ensuring prompt repayment of
loans, according to Bartini.

Ramsey Clark and the Berrigan Brothers

by Jack Sharman

So help me, I smell incense. Periodically, the
Sixties, like pubescent mantras, rise up with great
foolishness and foist themselves upon our own
Enlightened Decade. Last Sunday, as I watched
Easy Rider on television, Peter Fonda stared at
his tri-colored gas cap and muttered “freedom”
and ‘“‘split’”’ and “thing” for, catastrophically,
nearly two hours.

However, Easy Rider was amusing, if aught
else. Ramsey Clark and the Berrigans are not
amusing. No, coolie, they are not a band. Surely
you remember Ramsey Clark; former Attorney
General and Lyndon Johnson’s administrative
answer to Tinkerbell? Clark’s liberal posturings
put him in the limelight for quite some time during
the late Sixties and early Seventies. Since then he
has been mercifully quiescent, rising only now and
then in attempts to save us from ourselves.

The phoenix has risen again: Last June, Clark
went to Iran and spoke at an Iranian special con-
vention entitled ‘‘Crimes of America,” no doubt a
lucid and progressive assembly. So? The catch is
that the President had previously banned travel to
Iran, without special permission, on the part of
American citizens. As a result, the Justice Depart-
ment is currently considering a charge against
Clark of violating the 1977 International Emergen-
cy Economic Powers Act. Clark, little ghoul that
he is, is not bothering with the Justice Depart-
ment. On the contrary, he is urging Congress to set
up a special committee to investigate U.S. ac-
tivites in Iran. He has even begun a lecture tour:
at American University in Washington, he was
besieged by students demanding his autograph,
which causes one to reflect upon the insanities that
must be zinging about the halls of American
University late at night.

He does not have the right to

violate an act of Congress as
he opines and labors.

 

Very well. Ramsey Clark is a private citizen
—albeit one with a public following — and as such
he has a right to any opinion he cares to hold about
the American hostage situation in Iran. He also
has the right to state his opinion in public and to
labor to persuade the Administration to adopt his
views. He does not have the right to violate an act

of Congress as he opines and labors.

The question is as much a moral as a legal one.
Here is an individual who travels to a country
where American citizens are being forcibly held
by the state — or at least with the consent and sup-
port of the state — and who promptly prostrates
himself at a four-day-long propaganda buffet
prepared by a tyrant, a large cast of Persian buf-
foons, and a group of students whose most civiliz-
ed mode of communication is an AK-47 rifle (or,
more likely, a confiscated M-16). It is Ramsey
Clark’s option to speak and act on behalf of
Ramsey Clark and his beliefs. It is not Ramsey
Clark’s option to do so or not, nor is it his option to
make statements as an American representative
that are — I do not use the word lightly — coward-
ly. Clark’s action was intolerable, and he should
be punished.

 

Clark’s action was intolerable
and he should be punished.

 

About the same time that Clark was pirouetting
over American society as Attorney General, the
Berrigan brothers — Daniel and Phillip — were
making headlines for a number of protests,
pranks, and demonstrations on behalf of every
radical chic cause the Sixties had to offer. Daniel
is a priest, Phillip a former one, but the only badge
of office on Daniel is what appears to be a Green-
peace medallion, with which he surely plans to
buy a loaf of bread during the Coming Devalua-
tion. A couple of weeks ago, Daniel and Phillip and
a couple good ol’ boys from the Atlantic Life Com-
munity — an anti-nuclear group — broke into a
Minuteman plant in King of Prussia, Pennsyl-
vania, pounded a few nose cones with hammers,
and poured some of their blood on blueprints.

One does not know. Perhaps they had a buzz:
snorting ground conch shell will do that. Whatever
their motivation — which they said was to draw at-
tention to the “runaway arms race’”’ — their ac-
tion, like Clark’s, was inexcusable. Breaking and
entering a missile plant, and damaging materials
within it, is neither a prank nor a legal means of
protest, nor is it justifiable as civil disobedience,
since there was no government demand weighing
directly upon the Berrigans, and since their action
was not peaceful. It was a crime, and they should
be treated as felons.

Digital Santana is
‘The Swing of Delight’

Sessions With McLean;

‘Contour’ From the 50 s

 

by Spencer Leffel
Following two sub-par efforts (Inner Secrets
and Marathon), Devadip Carlos Santana has
bounced back to record one of the finest albums of
his career. The Swing of Delight (Columbia C2
36590) is indeed a delight for both its superb play-
ing and its clean, true digitally produced sound.
Santana’s working band is augmented on this ef-
fort by a host of jazz notables, including bassist
Ron Carter, drummers Tony Williams and Harvey
Mason, saxophonist Wayne Shorter and keyboar-
dist Herbie Hancock. Carter, Williams, and Mason
perform quite well; Shorter and Hancock are ex-
cellent and disappointing, respectively.
Everything Shorter touches on this album turns
to gold. His sinewy, twisting soprano sax is as
stunning as ever, particularly on “Love Theme
From Spartacus” and “Gardenia.” He also con-

tributes two beautiful compositions, “Shere Khan”

and “Tiger.” Hancock, by comparison, sounds or-
dinary. Creating music as bad as that of his two
most recent albums (Feets Don’t Fail Me Now and
Monster) has apparently affected him adversely.
Most of his solos sound flat and rather lifeless,
especially when juxtaposed against the inspired
playing of the rest of the participants. Herbie
finally breaks out of the fog on “Golden Hours”
when he programs a synthesizer to sound like an
electric guitar and trades licks with Santana. It’s
kind of gimmicky, but at least Hancock sounds ex-
cited on this one.

And what of Santana himself? Happily, he has
never sounded better. All of his trademarks are in
evidence: the sustained tones, the gracefully bent
notes and the flickering runs. Seldom has he used
them so skillfully. Carlos develops his solos with
engaging ideas, not the pointless series of fast riffs
we sometimes hear from certain other guitarists
of the jazz-rock vein. The structural unity of his
playing does not inhibit his emotional message,
but, rather, intensifies it. Santana has never
sounded more joyous. A good example of this
comes in a song called “Swampan Tari” written by
his guru and spiritual leader, Sri Chimnoy. Play-

by Mark Schramm

While it is true that the career of altoist Jackie
McLean has taken several different paths, one
could say that the most pivotal part of his career
occurred in the mid-fifties during his work with
Charles Mingus. It was at this time that McLean
broke free from the shadow of his early mentor
Charlie Parker and developed his own, im-
mediately recognizable, acid, angular tone. This
change in the McLean sound has been well-
documented in a reissue of two 1956 sessions:
CONTOUR (Prestige 24067). This album clearly
defines the emergence of McLean as a major force
on the jazz scene.

The first record of the set predates McLean’s
recording of Pithecanthropus Erectus with Mingus.
It is in every way a “blowing session” of the time,
with the only writing coming at the opening of Up
and the close of Inding, with the rest of the titles
based on the blues or standards. While the spectre
of Parker hovers over the record, we see McLean
just beginning to add his own touches. On Lights
out, McLean shows a stark, piercing, blues-rooted
sound; he also blows several phrases intentionally
flat, which gives the piece a wonderfully melan-
cholic, distant feel.

While 4 Foggy Day is certainly a nod to his
earliest influence, Lester Young, McLean shows
the first signs of his upper-register climaxes that
he would perfect by the early sixties: On Lorraine,
recorded by Parker as Embraceable You, McLean
expounds succinctly on Bird’s ideas, although he
chooses to quote directly at the end.

The second album, recorded several months
iafter the first, is the more enjoyable of the pair.
McLean’s maturity as a saxophonist is clearly evi-
dent from the outset, as he combines bird-like
phrases with his own embellishments. The greater
harmonic variety in the tunes from this session
also work to McLean’s advantage.

McLean swings confidently on When I Fall In
Love, and his light delicacy surprisingly recalls
Paul Desmond. On Abstraction, he shows he no
longer feels the need to deliver Parkerish multi-

vides the screening room, the
Washington and Lee Student
Executive Committee has con-
tributed $1,000 towards this
year’s budget, and numerous
people in the business and
academic communities con-

expects a season of nine or ten
films.

Angi Vera is the story of a
young woman’s experience with
love and politics in the newly
Communist Hungary of 1948.
Vera is chosen for political
education at a party school as a
mark of distinction for her
courageous outspokenness. She
falls in love with her teacher, a

married man, and ultimately
becomes more ‘“‘Communist”’
than he, consenting to a process
in which her spontaneity is con-
verted into a politically reward-
ing strategy. Her indoctrination
is horrifyingly complete.

The film is memorably shot in
cold blue-greens for the party
and indoctrination scenes, and
reds and flesh-glow tones for
the after-work scenes, especial-
ly those set in the team-room, a
color scheme which makes
palpable the irreconcilable op-
position the movie demons-
trates exists between the
private and political realms.

In a brilliant, moving scene in
the middle of the movie, the

workers at the school hold a
celebration at which couples,
among them Vera and the
teacher, dance forehead to
forehead balancing ping-pong
balls between their faces in'a
contest to see who can keep the
ball from falling longest.
Though this offers an alter-
native to the emotional severity
of earlier scenes, it also reveals
the impossibility of love and in-
timacy, even at a moment of
Supposed recreation and
romance.

At the end of the movie,
another masterful scene shows
Vera riding in a chauffered
limousine into a secure future
while a woman who attended

the party school with her un-
reachably recedes into the past
ona bicycle.

The Film Society’s second
movie is Yannick Bellon’s Rape
of Love (France, 1979), schedul-
ed for November 7 and 8. All
members of the Society are
welcome to attend a meeting on

ticular delight.

On Why Was I Born, McLean takes a surprising-
ly humorous, urbane approach that works well; he
also uses the lower register of his horn to further
strengthen his ideas and increase the emotional
extremes of his tones. The highlight of the com-
pilation is Confirmation, one of Charlie Parker’s
most challenging Works. On this cut, McLean is
joined by tenorman Hank Mobely, whose cushion-
ed muscularity provides a stark contrast to
McLean’s strident, relentless tone. The pair blow
mightily, with McLean’s strident, relentless tone.

- Santana’s current band is one of his best. One of
the album’s few drawbacks is that his own unit
doesn’t receive as much space as it might because
of the guest artists. Russell Tubbs is a fine sax-

only two songs, but he holds up well in comparison

album does not compare to McLean’s Blue Note
issues (Destination Out, or Let Freedom Ring) or his
recent release of The Source with Dexter Gordon,
it is an important foundation, as it allows us to
view the McLean career in retrospect. It shows us
the initial directions that guided this brilliant, far-
reaching artist to his eventual place as one of the
greatest altomen in jazz.

mon thread in all of Santana’s music, and this is no
exception. The group has two virtuosos in Raul
Rekow and Armando Peraza, and they add
rhythmic flavor and tension to every piece.

This is one of the few really good fusion albums
to come out in the last few years. A major reason

for this quality is that this music is truly a fusion of
various musical elements, not dressed-up disco

masquerading as jazz-rock. Santana combines
straight-ahesd jazz, heavy rock, Latin music and
his own soul to create a unique musical ex-

Abraxas, Caravanaerai and Moonflower as one of
Santana’s best works.

Commentary:

 

The Legends

by Ralph Frasca

The regular major league
baseball season has drawn to
yet another conclusion, resplen-
dent with the surprises, come-
backs and flops that char-
acterize every season. A few
teams were involved in pennant
races in the closing weeks, but
most were merely playing out
their schedule, trying to win
half of their games, —

Laboring on these teams were
some of the best players of the
1960’s and 1970’s, finishing out
careers in mundane, lackluster
fashion. Their roles serve as a
striking comparison to glory
years of their pasts, when they
were among the most danger-
ous hitters or craftiest pitchers.
Lately they had been reduced to
secondary duties for the most
part, lending stability and
leadership to their ballclubs.

Possibly the biggest news of
this baseball season was the
retirement of Willie McCovey,
who teamed with Willie Mays to
give the San Francisco Giants
the most feared one-two punch
in the National League through-
out the 1960’s. Fearing ‘‘Stret-
ch” might be slowing down a
bit, the Giants shipped him off
to the Padres in 1974 for a bag of
broken bats and some lawn fur-
niture. Shortly afterward, the
Padres sent him up the coast to
Finley Land, where McCovey
struggled mightily to revive a
crumbling Oakland ballclub.
His age, 39, weighing heavily
against him, the A’s returned
him to the Giants in 1977, who
accepted Willie more as a favor
to him rather than to fill a
specific need. All Willie did was
knock their socks off by smack-
ing a_ startling number of
homeruns. He followed with two
more prodigious years in 1978
and 1979, but this year Willie
turned 42, and a kid named Rick
Murray was making some noise
in the farm system. And so the
Giants dumped the still-
productive Willie, the best lef-
thanded hitter in history (521
home runs), and an excep-
tionally graceful filler around
first base.

But he was 42. He played with
the enthusiasm and skill of a
man half his age, but the fact
remained, and the arbitrary
and high-handed executives
were irked by a man coura-
geously defying his years, and
so they forced him to retire.

This season is also the best for
Lou Pinella, who has become a
more dangerous hitter with age.
He toiled in the torpid confines
of Kansas City’s Municipal
Stadium for five years before
being dealt to the Yankees in

19/4, where he earned the
recognition he deserved. He has
helped New York build a dynas-
ty of sorts, which has reached
the World Series three of the
past four years.

Lou, who has been seen of lave
frolicking with a bevy of pretty
girls and mugging his way
through a commercial for
designer jeans, has become
disgruntled with his relegation
to part-time status and will thus
hang up the spikes at age 37.
Lou will always be remembered
for his spectacular catches on
the Yankee Stadium outfield
wall, causing the crowd to cheer
while he crumpled to the
ground, still clutching the ball.

Jim Kaat has been pitching
for a series of mediocre teams
since 1959, and will probably
always be around to throw his
tantalizingly slow curve. Kaat’s
pitching can agitate fans and
spectators alike. Those cream
puffs make one’s palms itch,
and one is inevitably over-
whelmed by a desire to hop out
of the stands, saunter up to the
plate and take a few rips at this
guy’s pitching. The truth is, we
wouldn’t have much success
against Kaat, and neither have
major league hitters for the
past 22 years.

Jim was released by the
Yankees early this season, but
was snatched up by the anemic
St. Louis Cardinals, who have
the worst pitching staff this side
of the Southern Seminary soft-
ball team. Kaat has since prov-
ed to be their most effective pit-
cher, and has played a major
role in their climb to fourth
place, past my lovably stagnant
Mets.

These are just three of the
numerous fallen star's who are
winding out their careers in
relative obscurity. Friendly,
outgoing Manny Sanguillen has
since been relegated to sporadic
pinch-hitting duties, but he was
the best-hitting catcher during
the first half of the 1970’s, with
the exception of Johnny Bench.
Mark Belanger, one of the
greatest fielders ever, is still
playing at age 41, 30-year old
Woodie Fryman turned in
another spectacular relief job
for the Expos, and 38-year-old
Tony Perez is still a prodigious
hitter for the Red Sox. And so
on.

These aging legends made
their niche in baseball history,
but have yielded the limelight to
younger men. I hope they play
forever, because I grew up col-
lecting their baseball cards,
watching them perform their
own special brand of magic.

Generals Lose, 14-10, As
Comeback Effort Falters

by Dale Park

After falling behind 10-0 in the
first half, the Randolph-Macon
Yellow Jackets overcame the
W&L varsity football team with
two second half touchdowns for
a 14-10 victory.

The loss derailed the
Generals’ two game win streak
and dropped their season
record to 3-2.

‘‘We missed some important
scoring opportunities,’ said
head coach Gary Fallon.

After recovering an R-MC
fumble early in the first period,
W&L marched to the Yellow
Jacket 15-yard line before the
drive stalled. Sophomore kicker
Bill Devine then booted a 31
yard field goal, but R-MC was
offsides and the five yard penal-
ty gave the Generals’ first-and-
goal at the Yellow Jacket ten.
The offense again stalled, but
this time R-MC_ blocked
Devine’s 24 yard attempt.

Two possessions later, W&L
drove to the R-MC 12-yard line.
As was the problem all after-
noon, the General offense was
again stopped cold within the
twenty-yard line. On fourth-

and-two, Devine hooked a 30
yard attempt wide to the left of
the goal posts.

The Generals began putting
points on the board midway
through the second quarter as
Devine canned a 25 yard field
goal. Six minutes later, W&L
scored again on a nineteen-yard
trap play run by senior fullback
Lee Minetree.

But in the second half, both
the Macon offense and defense
came alive. Relying mainly on
their passing attack to get them
in scoring position, the Yellow

- Jackets scored on a twenty yard

pass play in the third quarter
and a 50 yard run in the final
period.

Although losers in almost
every category of statistics, the
Yellow Jackets racked up a
crucial 5.2 yards per play, most-
ly on the strength of their se-
cond half running.

Commented Fallon: “The
Yellow Jackets began blitzing
linebackers and seemed to run
right into everything we called.
Also, Macon’s quarterback

Sean Shull showed good

quickness and went to his alter-
nate recievers well.”

On the day, sophomore
tailback Chris Cavalline was
held to 62 yards on 23 carries as
the Yellow Jackets’ defense
swarmed over W&L’s newly
found offensive threat.

W&L staged a last-gasp drive
in the final three minutes of the
game, going all the way to the
R-MC one yard line. But an il-
legal receiver penalty against
the Generals put the ball back
to the sixteen yard line and the
game ended with Macon in-
tercepting a desperate W&L
pass attempt.

‘In the second half our
defense pressued itself too
much, and there was a
breakdown in_ individual
responsibility,’ said Fallon.

On October 18th, the Generals
will face a tough Hampden-
Sydney team. W&L defeated H-
SC 20-0 last year at Sydney.
Last Saturday, the Tigers
trounced Bridgewater, 35-6.

Game time is 1:30 p.m. on
Wilson Field.

Netmen Third In Madison Tourney

by Phil Murray

The Generals finished third
behind Richmond and James
Madison this weekend at the
James Madison Invitational
with a 1-2 record.

The netmen got off to a bad
start Friday on the fast
Madison courts losing to the
hosts 2-7, in the first of their
three round robin matches. No.
1 Pete Lovell earned the only
singles victory with a convinc-
ing 7-6 (5-3), 6-1 score. Doug
Gaker and Steve Denny both
lost tight matches, 6-4, 7-5 and
6-0, 2-6, 7-5 respectively.

The no. 1 doubles team of
Lovell and Gaker scored the on-
ly other win 1-6, 7-5, 7-5 against
the Madison team of Snead and
Salas.

The Generals seemed to have
a better feel of the quick courts
Saturday as they thumped VMI,
8-1, in the first of the two mat-
ches scheduled for that day.

The top singles players won-

easy victories over their Keydet
rivals and freshman Scott Ber-
man, playing in the number 5
spot, won his first varsity mat-
ch, 6-1, 6-1.

The doubles teams enjoyed
similar success winning all
three matches in straight sets.

Finally, the netmen faced a
well balanced Richmond team
which ended up winning the
competition. Although they lost
2-7, Coach Franke felt that the
team played much better than
in their first match against

Madison: “With a couple of
breaks, we could have come out
of the singles 4-2 instead of 2-4.”
Lovell and Denny each lost
tough three set matches which
went right down to the wire in
the third set.

The wins also came in close
contests. Gaker won 7-6 (5-0),
5-7, 74 (5-2), and No. 6 Mark

Williams, 6-4, 7-6 (5-4).

Overall, Coach Franke was
pleased with the performance,
especially of the top three
players. He looks for continued
improvement in two weeks
when the Generals host
Maryland, U.Va., and Ohio in
the fourth annual W&L Invita-
tional.

| _ Injuries more or less dictated
the outcome for W&L’s cross
country meet last Saturday.

In their home opener, the
Generals took on Roanoke Col-
lege and Norfolk State College
at less than full strength. They
‘entered the meet knowing that
they would be missing fresh-
man Bill Benson, who will be
out indefinitely. Sophomore
_John Kelafant aggravated a
| sprained knee which he injured
prior to the meet and was
unable to finish. To make mat-
ters worse, freshman Lars
Keeley became the victim of yet
another injury when he sustain-
ed a sprained ankle during the
meet. Under these adverse and
ill-fated circumstances, W&L
finished a distant third, with
| Roanoke and Norfolk State in a
_ dead heat for the first two spots,
respectively.

Coach Dick Miller was not
totally disappointed with the
outcome. “When you are miss-
ing three runners of their

 

Harriers Lose Tri-Meet

|

caliber, you can expect to do on-
ly so well. The rest of the team
gave it their best try and that’s
all I am looking for.”’

For the second time in as
many weeks, freshman Angus
McBryde led the way with a
second place finish, only nine
seconds off the pace. His time of
27:10 represents a reduction of
almost two minutes from last
week’s meet at Mary Washing-
ton. Rounding out the scoring
for W&L were senior co-
captains Charlie Werner and
Howard Herndon, tenth and)
eleventh respectively, and_|
sophomore Mo Gill, who came}
in fourteenth. |

The Generals will take their
1-1 record to Newport News this
Saturday and take on_ host
Christopher Newport College,
as well as Lynchburg College
and, for the second consecutive
week, Norfolk State College.
Whether or not Kelafant and
Keeley will be able to compete
is still uncertain.

 

 

 
by Mark Schramm
The Generals convincingly
swept both matches this week,
first blitzing rival Hampden-
Sydney 4-0 and then blanking
Division I ranked Davidson 2-0
in their home opener.

Two goals by freshman
Roland Simon, his fourth and
fifth of the year, were the dif-
ference against the Hampsters.
Less than two minutes into the
game, Simon was fouled at the
25-yard line. His indirect kick
eluded the defensive wall and
slammed into the back of the
net.

Thirty seconds into the se-
cond half, Brad Poorman bolted
down the wing and dropped the
ball to Simon. The powerful
center rifled a shot goalward; it

deflected off a defender’s leg
and rolled slowly over the goal-
line.

The Generals controlled play
throughout the match, with the
mid-field line of Captain Bryan
Williams, Mark Carduna, Ben
Muskin, and Paul Ritter rarely
letting the Hampsters penetrate
past midfield.

Play was aggressive from the
opening whistle, with both
teams tackling hard. The
superior-conditioned Generals
wore down the Hampsters, how-
ever, and by the middle of the
second half the issue was decid-
ed.

Mark Turner and Brad Poor-
man tallied before the game’s
end. Poorman’s goal came on a
corner kick; he hooked the ball

toward the far post, and the
goalie, attempting to bat the
ball over the crossbar, knocked
it into the net.

Player of the game laurels
were shared by Simon and
Defender Mark Sullivan, who
closed down the Hampsters’
best forward with no shots on
goal. The victory gave the
Generals their second road vic-
tory of the season.

The Generals’ second victory
of the week was an upset of
Division I ranked Davidson,
who entered the game with a 7-1
mark before bowing to W&L 2-0.

Winger Brad Poorman was
again a standout, as he scored
the two lone goals, his second
and third of the year.

Poorman started off early, as
he coralled a pass from Mid-

The Ring-tum Phi, October 9, 1989, Page 7

fielder Ben Muskin and beat the
Wildcat netminder just 2:30 in
the game.

Freshman defender Steve
Smith gained his first assist as
he lofted a pass to Poorman,
who flew down his wing slow
and tallied his second goal 12
minutes into the second half.

The match, played before an
enthusiastic W&L crowd which
turned out despite the wet con-
ditions, was another physical
one. The two teams had clashed
in an indoor tournament last
year (won by the Wildcats 2-1)
in which several fights broke
out; the intensity carried over
to this match.

Once again, the Generals
proved stronger, and by the end
of the game, they were
manhandling the Wildcats. ‘‘We

were hungry for this one,’’ said
Coach Rolf Piranian, ‘We
wanted to avenge that loss.”

The defense was tight the en-
tire match. The ‘No Goal
Patrol” shut down a_ potent
Wildcat front line and con-
tinually pushed the ball upfield.

Goalies Kirk Mancer and
Kevin Carney (who will break
the W&L save record before the
year is out) gained their second
consecutive shutout: The two
alternate halves and comple-
ment each other well, with each
making important saves.

After upping their record to
3-1, the Generals travel to Har-
risonburg to play Eastern Men-
nonite before returning home

Saturday to face Radford
(2:00).

Water Polo Slide Continues; Drop Three

by Dave Johnson

The W&L water polo team
travelled to Pennsylvania for
the Slippery Rock Invitational,
where they continued their
disappointing series of losses by
dropping four out of five games
last weekend.

The Generals won their first
game against Princeton by a
score of 13-7. They then pro-
ceeded to lose four straight
games to Penn State (8-7), Slip-
pery Rock (12-5), Millersville
(13-8), and Cornell (12-6). It is
interesting to note that
Princeton was the toughest
competition of the weekend, but
they were the only team that
W&L managed to beat.

The poor showing by the
water polo team this fall is dif-
ficult to understand after last
year’s impressive 20-7 season
and the number of promising
freshmen recruits. W&L
aquatics is blessed this year
with an abundance of young,
quality athletes, but they can’t
seem to get on the right track.

Perhaps the reason for the
lack of success lies in a prevail-
ing sense of complacency. The
team is dominated by freshmen
who for the most part are un-
challenged for their starting
positions. Maybe this satisfac-
tion with a starting role is what
has led to the mental
breakdowns’ which have
plagued the Generals all
season.

Despite their problems,
Coach Remillard has not lost
hope or confidence in his team.
He knows that they have the
potential to be successful, he

 

admits that some of the

season’s mistakes have been his
own, and he believes that the
Generals will play to their
capabilities soon.

Three of the freshman
members of the team had
notable performances in the
tournament. Rand McClain, the
“quarterback’’ of the team,
continues to show steady im-
provement on defense, while

fellow classmate Don ‘‘Shark’’
Smith lends valuable consisten-
cy. Another freshman, Tim
Rock, also the head football
cheerleader, came on strong in
the last two games of the
tourney, leading the team’s
scoring in both.

With all these freshman
names being mentioned, one
might wonder about the play of

Herndon Enjoying

by Ed Gonsalves

Howard Herndon is excellent
proof that Washington and Lee
athletics, often overshadowed
by the: University’s academic
reputation, offers a challenging
and rewarding experience.

A senior, Herndon had never
tried distance running before
coming to W&L. In high school
his forte was the bassoon, which
he played with enough expertise
to earn a pair of All-State band
honors.

‘“‘When I got to W&L, I knew I
wanted to try something else; I
wanted a challenge,’”’ he ex-
plains. ‘‘I had reached such a
point of proficiency with the
bassoon that unless I played 4-5
hours a day, my skill would
diminish. I wanted to start from
scratch and accomplish
something new.”

The motive to try cross coun-

try came from his sister,
herself a runner, and a good
friend who was a World Class

 

runner. “Another motive for
taking up the sport was the
health and physical fitness
benefit,’ Herndon adds.

The early miles, of course,

the older and more experienced
players on the team. Admitted-
ly there aren’t many up-
perclassmen on the squad, but

they have also made
themselves notably in-
conspicuous.

Despite this gloomy report,
the water polo Generals are by
no means out of reach of a fine
season, especially considering

were not easy. Prior to enrol-
ling at W&L, Herndon’s last
participation in a sport had
been during his sophomore year
in high school. ;

‘When I started out, the cross

country coach here (Dick
Miller), gave me a lot of en-
couragement,’’ he relates.

“Those first few ten-miles a day
were pure hell, but the guys on
the team were really great. We
were like a family, and that
helped a lot.”

Now with three full seasons of
cross country to his credit,
Herndon has indeed met the
challenge and made the ac-

overall and fourth among W&L
runners in the team’s first meét
this season. “If the captains
were the number one runners,
the workouts and meets would
be oriented towards an_in-
dividual rather than the team.”

The Hitching Post

by Louise Seymour

The traditional hitching post
battle held Sunday, September
28, was the new freshmen’s first
experience as a class at Sweet
Briar. They collected buckets of
diluted purple paint to wage
battle against the sophomore’s
blue.

Members of the two classes
attired, in worn sweat pants,
gym shorts, rubberboots, tennis
shoes and bandanas, gathered
at 8:30 p.m. to prepare
Strategies and raise spirit.
Sister classes crowded on the
wall in front of Benedict to spec-
tate and lend support.

At 9:00 p.m., following the
blast of a whistle, the excite-
ment began. The freshmen
formed chains, entwining

themselves around the post,
already colored a very weak
shade of purple.

The sophomores charged for

ee WARNER & POLE

For your extra pieces of furniture

the initial attack, hurling cups
of blue paint and pouring all of
their energies into loosening
their closely bound rivals. Foul
play, involving pulling, kicking,
and strangling, occurred. When
a casualty resulted, leaping on-
to the freshmen was outlawed.

The periodic rest breaks were
welcomed. When the paint sup-
ply ran low, water was used.
Still, the wetness, coupled with
the cool weather, did not
dampen spirits. By 10:15 when
fatigue set in and recruits were
not to be found, the sophomores
forfeited the post in favor of the
rock.

Cheers of ‘‘Who do we ap-

_ preciate’’ followed. Copies of a

freshman cheer were passed
around before the girls rushed
away to shower off the pale blue
paints covering them. Now the
purple post and blue rock stand
as tributes...until next year.

October Elections

(continued from page 1)
due at the meeting and the EC
will discuss all regulations per-
taining to the campaign and the
election.

After a lengthy discussion,
the committee decided to dis-
cuss the issue further at a latter
date, agreeing that the issue
probably will not be a problem
in the October 20th election.

The Student Activities Board
presented the committee with
its September budget report
and also reported on plans for
Homecoming the weekend of
October 25th.

The SAB spent $248.50 in
presenting three movies last
month and totalled receipts of
$212 in admissions charges. The
board now has $3,713.50 to spend
on movies for the remainder of
the year.

Co-Chairman Pryse Elam
reported that two rock bands
will play at Homecoming in
Doremus Gym the night of Oc-
tober 24th. Both Skip Castro and
the New Riders of the Purple
Sage will perform at a cost of
about $7,250. Included in that

figure is the agent fee, the cost

of setting-up and cleaning the
gym, security and a piano
tuner.

In other business, the Cold-
Check Committee reported that
it had collected $800 worth of
checks and fines since last spr-
ing. Chairman Mike Malesardi
also reported that the commit-
tee is having some problems
determining which students
might have paid during
matriculation since some
checks may have been stolen in
the burglary at the Registrar’s
office last month. He said the
committee hopes to clear the
matter up shortly.

The Executive Committee
also approved a motion to give
WLUR $200 for election cover-
age on November 4th. The
money will be used by the sta-
tion in an extensive effort to
provide Rockbridge County
with up-to-date election returns
and predictions on the local,
state and national elections.

The next meeting of the Ex-
ecutive Committee is 6:30 p.m.
on Monday in the Executive
Committee room.

New Economics Professor

From UCLA To W&L _

by Chris Peacock

Bruce Hale Herrick under-
went a dramatic change of en-
vironment when he moved from
U.C.L.A. to Washington and Lee
this fall to become professor of
economics and head of the
department. But he appears to
be most satisfied with his deci-
sion, as it is something of a
homecoming for the man who
grew up in rural Minnesota and
spent his undergarduate days at
a small Carleton College.

There are obvious differences
between W&L and U.C.L.A.
—they are nearly a continent
apart from each other; one is a
small, private undergraduate

  

 

s
villi

W&L and UCLA.

institution while the other is a
large state university; and Lex-
ington is a town of a few thou-
sand while Los Angeles is one of
the country’s largest cities. Dr.
Herrick has seen some of these
numerical differences in his
own classes. ‘‘My largest class
here does not even approach the
size of my smallest classes at
U.C.L.A.”’ he says, adding that
the large seminar rooms in Mc-
Cormick Hall could not begin to
hold any of his U.C.L.A. classes.

But he seems more impressed
with changes which cannot be
measured in such concrete
terms. The honor system here
provides a stark contrast to
U.C.L.A. where he ‘‘learned to
anticipate a constant drizzle of
cheating,’’ and ‘‘to expect very
little administrative support”
in combatting the problem. Dr,
Herrick emphasized, ‘“The pro-
blem is with a small minority
percentage-wise, but adds up to
five or six people in a class of
500.”” :

He is ‘‘very enthusiastic”
about W&L’s new
Undergraduate Library. While
there are fewer books in W&L’s

‘ . e sts Hey ee

 

   

a

library than in U.C.L.A.’s, the
smaller number of users means
their availability is much
greater, and thus more helpful
to his research. His expertise
has led him to co-author a text-
book (now in sevision for a
fourth edition) on the
economics in Third World coun-
tries.

At W&L Dr. Herrick has
found and been pleased with ‘‘a
lack of bureaucracy and a lot of
formalism.’’ Also, he considers
the school’s liberal arts em-
phasis a necessity. ‘‘I would in-
sist on liberal arts’’ to go along
with an education in economics.
“The aim in_ studying
economics,’’ he says, “is not
just how to make money.”

Along with W&L’s ‘“‘reputa-
tion of high quality’’ the oppor-
tunity to become head of the
department was a major factor
in his decision to come to W&L.
But he emphasizes that he does

. not see his role as that of a boss

of foreman. ‘‘That’s just wrong.
Yet it is something more than a
recording secretary at depart-
mental meetings.”’

Dr. Herrick was on the facul-
ty at U.C.L.A. ever since earn-
ing his Ph.D. in economics from
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1964, but has had
time off for such endeavors as a
sabbatical at Oxford and
several trips to South America
as a consultant for the World
Bank and USAID, the foreign

aid arm of the State Depart-~

ment. Also he has served as an
expert witness on the lost earn-
ings in cases of wrongful
deaths, estimating the lost
economic value of a husband or
wife killed, for example, by a
drunk driver.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Minute By Minute...

REGARDING MINUTES OF THE EXECUTIVE
COMMITTEE

1) Once again the previous week’s minutes were ap-
proved unanimously, that is 10-0.

2) The minutes, which might have never been
described in any circles as ‘“‘scintillating,” have this
year plunged to a new depth of mediocrity.

3) It is brought to our attention that portions of these
meetings are written in the present tense.

4) Other portions were written in past tense. A com-
mittee was appointed to investigate this startling er-
ror; members will subsequently be announced in-
dividually.

5) It is necessary that we put forth a resolution to con-
sider the implications which the grinding dullness of
said minutes have on personal attitudes harbored
toward That Body, The Executive Committee, and
the potential damage said attitudes might inflict upon
the committee’s future image with regard to bland-
ness and competence. The resolution, in the form of a
motion, reads: RESOLVED: The Executive Commit-
tee, while reserving its powers enumerated in the Stu-
dent Body Constitution, is strongly urged to place par-
ticular emphasis on the writing of clear, concise, in-
formative, grammatically correct minutes which are
unoffensive and not conducive to catatonia, and which
do not contain such notations as: ‘12. Mackie is
elected into getting rid of an old copier in the E.C. of-
fice.’’, followed up the next week with: ‘10. It was ap-
proved that Mackie could donate the E.C.’s old copier
and addresser to the Day Care Center...’’

Motion denied.

6) Nominations were placed for members-at-large of
the new joint ad hoc committee to investigate frater-
nity decay.

7) The meeting was adjourned at 10:30 p.m.

A Word From Dance Chairman

To the Editor:

As co-chairman of Washing-
ton and Lee’s 1980 Dance
Marathon For Muscular
Dystrophy, I would like to ex-
press a belated thanks to all
those (be they dancers,
workers, or spectators) who
contributed to the tremendous
success of last year’s event. To
quote an overused, yet accurate
cliche: ‘‘we couldn’t have done
it without you.”

More importantly, as co-
chairman of W&L’s 1981 Super-
dance to benefit those afflicted
with Muscular Dystrophy, I

‘would like to announce that we

are going to do it again!

Washington and Lee is going to
hold its third Annual Dance
Marathon. This year’s thirty-
hour celebration is to be held
February 6-8 and is sure to be
the most successful ever. We
are determined to present the
Muscular Dystrophy Associa-
tion W&L’s largest contribution
to date.

The planning and administra-
tion of this year’s dance began
last Tuesday, September 30
with the most well-attended
organizational meeting in our
short history. As all those pre-
sent were told, the success of
our marathon depends on the
dedication and effort of the stu-

dent committees and steering
committee. While many posi-
tions are already filled, we are
always in need of the aid of
others who have been unable to
contact us. If you would like to
help us in any capacity with
W&L’s largest fund raising
event ever, please inquire at the
University Student Center of-
fice with Carole Chappell.
Thank you for your continued
support and assistance in
Washington and Lee’s effort to

help defeat muscular
dystrophic diseases.

Sincerely,

J. Hemby ’81

Spectator

And you thought I was dead...that I had suc-
cumbed to the whoring sirens, my festering
pimples or some Fraternal Fungi. No, I am alive
and well, filled with new adventures and
venomous cynicism. I am a hero, too, admired,
honored, revered, loved, and envied by all. Read
on as I describe my awesome bravery during the
amazing Battle of Lexington.

You may have heard of this citadel of
lawlessness and corruption; Lexington is the
stage for such cinematic greats as West Side
Story, the French Connection, Saturday Night
Fever, and Animal House. The local gestapo,
though, are not concerned with violence. There
are 39 officers on the yellow line detail (in search
of errant autos and weak bladders), and the rest of
the force searches relentlessly for noise violators.
Chief Skurvey has made his position clear.

-I hate rock and roll. Social houses are whore
houses and drug centers. If we wipe them out, we
wipe out corruption; there’ll be no one left worth
robbing and no one left worth raping. The chain-
swinging, stiletto-equipped gangs that terrorize
the rich bastards will make our job easier.

Enter Spectator, your hero. The Battle of Lex-
ington had been raging for weeks. It was classic
Town vs. Gown warfare. The hoodlums had raped

two beautiful dates, stolen a cache of stereos, van-
dalized the stately fraternities, and attacked

... at War

scores of unarmed gentlemen. When I arrived on
the scene late one Saturday night, it looked as
though one of these bastions of gentility would be
overrun by these ruffians and sewer sluts. Broken
glass, silken bras, and bloody shirts littered the
entrance hall. At first, I figured this was a wild
and exciting party: lots of grain and lots of fun.
But then...

A green, slimy hand touched my date. A green,
slimy hand carressed her breast. A green,

slimy...I fainted. Yet as I fell, my head hit the

volume control on the stereo. ‘Tennessee Stud”’
could be heard all across campus.

Though the police had not heeded the emergen-
cy calls from the besieged fraternity, they arrived
in seconds to hand out a noise violation. When they
entered the house, armed with machine guns and
dressed in undercover clothes (khakis and izods) ,
the anti-sound gestapo looked like more fraternity
boys. The townies, infuriated, and none too in-
telligent, attacked the lead officer. A blaze of
machine gun fire and flashes of returning knives
and bottles filled the air. Hideous screams from
both sides told the tale of death and bloodshed.
And then there were none. The officers had shot all
the gutter urchins, and the urchins had wasted the
police. I awoke and heard one last voice.

‘Damn, this place is trashed. But what the hell;
let’s party!

Dear Editor:

Today I awoke, saw my fire
engine red corduroy trousers
with the large blue decorator
whales embroidered all over
them and for some reason
thought how beneficial tradition
has been for me. I think of how
it has enriched my life. After
all, I have a lot to be thankful
for. I’m a traditional man; I go
to a traditionally conservative
school; I’m surrounded by
traditional people of my own
choice; and I enjoy a traditional
life.

That’s all I really need —
tradition. Tradition is why I en-
joy an all-male school, like
Washington and Lee; it’s so
traditional, but still open-
minded and immensely
cosmopolitan. Tradition is what
keeps me from being surround-
ed by diversions like women,
whom I feel should occupy their
traditional place in life, flaky
intellectuals, and poor people.
Tradition is what enables us,
while associating with those of

our own choosing, to say,
‘‘We’re all men here!”’
Some say that we at

Washington and Lee blindly
follow tradition, but I don:t
believe this; after all, think of
all the significant social
dogmas that have been

eliminated here in the past

Robert E. Lee, our stellar presi-
dent, was a traditional man. In
his short stay here at W&L, he
broadened our science depart-
ment; he affiliated Lexington
Law School with W&L, he
started a business program and
instituted courses in journalism
which were the first such
courses to be offered at any col-
lege in the U.S. What could be
more traditional?

Some say that such acts were
liberal, open-minded, and way
ahead of their time, and that
Lee was ‘‘one of the most far-
sighted educational statesman
of the 19th century.” I’m sure

that everyone can see that Lee’s

dependence on tradition and the
conservative way of life was
what made him the great man
he was. That’s one of the
reasons I think Washington and
Lee should remain all-male:
General Lee would have wanted
it that way. But some liberals
I’ve talked to say that there is
bitter irony in the fact that Lee
was such a far-sighted in-
dividual, and yet the school he
brought to national attention
through his reforms has
become a bastion of conser-
vatism and sexism, and a slave
to misguided tradition which
enforces social atrocities, like

discrimination on the basis of
sex alone, which Lee would
have ceremoniously wiped out
had the times demanded such
action. To this I say, ‘‘pop-
pycock,’’ and advise, as I know
Lee would have done, that all
who don!t like it the way it is
should transfer elsewhere.

I agree with one faculty
member who advised against
coeducation because it ‘‘is
typical rather of Soviet Russian
and Red Chinese society,”’ and
was shocked when I read that a
couple of faculty members who
taught at co-ed schools, believe
that coeducation, ‘“‘tends to
widen the perpsective of the in-
structor as well as the student,”
and that W&L will become an
“enclave of the good old boys
sitting around discussing a
world that no longer exists.”’ I-
interpret this as saying that we
at Washington and Lee are not
keeping up with the times, but I
don’t believe this and I tell
myself it’s not true every time I
go to place flowers on
Traveller’s grave.

Law School

Favors Reagan

Ronald Reagan is the slight
favorite of law students at
Washington and Lee University
in next month’s Presidential
election, but independent can-
didate John Anderson showed
surprising strength as he nudg-
ed Jimmy Carter for second
place and reached within four
points of the marginal frontrun-
ner,

The poll, showing Reagan
with 31.5 percent of the vote,
Anderson with 28 percent and
Carter with 27, was conducted
by “Law News,” the student
newspaper in the law school.
Twelve percent of the law
students said they are still
undecided.

Of W&L’s 343 law students;
244, or 71 percent, took part in
the poll.

Anderson’s chief strength
came in the first — and third-
year classes, in each of which
he captured 31 percent of the
votes. Oddly, in the intervening
class, he received only half that
level of support, with 15.5 per-
cent of the second-year law
students.

Anderson came out on top
among law students~ who
characterize themselves as
political ‘independents,’ with
43 percent of that group, to
Reagan’s 20 percent and
Carter’s 17 percent. Half the

party Democrats went for their
party’s nominee, but Anderson
took a quarter of that vote too.
Among self-styled Republicans,
Reagan took 59 percent of the
vote, Anderson 20 percent and
Carter just 7 percent.

‘‘Independents’’ accounted
for a quarter of the poll par-
ticipants, Democrats for a third
of them, and Republicans 31
percent. Others listed no self-
characterization.

Males, who made up three-
quarters of the survey par-
ticipants, chose Reagan over
Anderson, 38 percent to 25 per-
cent, with Carter third at 23 per-
cent. Female law students, who
represented a quarter of the
participants, went for Carter
over Anderson by 37-to-32 per-
cent, with Reagan a distant
third, taking just 8 percent of
the law women’s vote.

SABU, we might as well appoint
one from the Cold Check com-
mittee or any other committee
that wants us to,”’ he said.

Smith disagreed. “I think
SABU is a special entity at

W&L, but if the SAB does not
see our situation as extenuating
then we are prepared to work
through other modes this year.
Next year we will definitely
have a representative in there.”’

Smith said, ‘I feel that a
SABU member could represent
the black minority here. I
believe we have something to
offer that would benefit the SAB
and W&L community as a
whole. We would like to con-
tribute and be heard.”

Both Elam and Small said
they hoped that SABU would not

be upset over the SAB decision
and emphasized that all
members of SABU are welcome
to attend open meetings.
However, Smith said he didn’t
think SABU’s presence would
be effective without voting
privileges.

Still, Elam said a personal in-
vitation to attend all open
meetings would be sent to Jim
Herbert, president of SABU.
Elam added that he could not
stress enough that anyone’s
views are welcome at the
meetings.

Apathy Expected Among Students

With the 1980 general election
less than a month away,
pollsters are predicting one of
the lowest voter turnouts ever
— and the group with the worst
voting record is young people
from eighteen to twenty-one
years old. If you are the
average Washington and Lee
student, the odds are that you

will not vote in November. Com-

pounding the problem of apathy
is the difficulty faced in
absentee voting.

In order to facilitate absentee
voting, copies of the Federal
Voting Assistance Guide have
been placed on campus. These

‘guides are located in the Uni-

versity Center office outside the
Cockpit, behind the circulation
desks of the University and Law
