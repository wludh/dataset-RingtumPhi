Losses Bring End To W&L Record Store

by Eric Fife

After eight years of opera-
tion, the W&L Record Store,
located in the bottom half of the
book store, closed its doors as of
2 p.m. today.

The decision to close the store
was made during a meeting bet-
ween University Treasurer and
E. Stewart Epley and Bookstore
Manager Betty Munger.

Mrs. Munger said that closing
the store is the result of two pro-
blems which have been reoc-

‘ ,

 

curring over the past few years.
The Record Store has had
operating losses of several thou-
Sand dollars annualy and
managers seldom stayed on for
more than one year at a time.
According to Mrs. Munger,
the Record Store has lost ap-
proximtely $3,000 this academic
year. Epley said that the total
loss, which includes Social
Security, insurance, workmen’s
compensation and utility ex-
penses, will equal almost $6,000.

Washington and Lee University’s Student Association for Black Unity (SABU) held its annual ball
recently as one of the highlights of Black Emphasis Month which has brought several nationally promi-
nent speakers, including actress Ruby Dee, to the campus.

“The basic problem with the
Record Store,’’ said Epley, ‘‘is
the low sales volume.”’ Accor-
ding to Epley, the Record Store
cannot advertise in town
because other record mer-
chants would complain of being
undersold. This is due to the
fact that W&L’s record store
has small overhead costs.

Mrs. Munger said her biggest
problem with the Record Store
has been retaining managers
for more than a year. She

 

‘es ’ ‘q

 

 

 

claimed that she has trained
five seperate managers in the
last five years.

‘“‘No one makes this their
life’s work,’’ Mrs. Munger said.
This is a way station. Often the
managers are students who
want the chance to stay around
Rockbridge County for an extra
year.”

Record Store Manager Jeff
Badgett said that low pricing is
the store’s top priority. Badgett
says he buys $7.98 list albums
for $4.75 and sells them for $5.50
—a 75-cent profit. An $8.98 list
album costs $5.20 and sells for
$5.75 at the Book Store.

Badgett said the function of
the Record Store was to in-
troduce students to music that
they normally- would not come
across. ‘‘If one person comes
across classical music while
he’s here, then our purpose is
accomplished,’ said Badgett.
‘‘When the store closes,
students will be deprived of a
cultural resource.”

Student and faculty reaction
to the closing of the store is ap-
pearing in the form of petitions.
Mrs. Munger said that several
students had expressed their
disappointment in the store’s
closing.

According to Mrs. Munger,
the remaining inventory will be
sold at cost on Monday in the
main level of the Bookstore.

City Council Rejects Kappa Sigma Appeal

by Bill Whalen

An appeal by the Kappa
Sigma fraternity to receive a
special use permit for a new
chapter house-was unanimously
rejected last Thursday night by
the Lexington City Council.

Thursday night’s ruling
marked the second time in two
months the fraternity has been
denied a request to use the
house, which is located at 516
Main St. On January 28, Kappa
Sigma was turned down by the
Lexington Planning Commis-
sion.

“It’s not a vote against the
fraternities, it’s a vote for the
neighborhood,’”’ said Gerald
Nay. Councilman Larry Mann
also commented on the deci-
sion, stating that the vote was
one of ‘‘public welfare.”’

The hearing lasted over 45

minutes, yet it was a time in,

which deep faith and deep
mistrust of fraternity life were
expressed. Kappa Sigma
argued that the establishment
of the fraternity at 516 South
Main St is necessary for the
fraternity’s survival.

Several residents living near
the house argued vehemently
that the reestablishment of the
fraternity would be a danger to
the peace of the neighborhood.

Jim Gianniny, of 523 S. Main
St., presented a petition with
the names of 35 Lexington
residents opposed to the grant-
ing of a special use permit.
Gianniny claimed that under
Lexington city code, a condi-
tional use permit cannot be
granted if: (1) it affects the
health or safety of people living
in the neighborhood, (2) it is
detrimental to public welfare or
neighborhood property, (3) it is
in conflict with the city’s adopt-
ing comprehensive plan.

According to Gianniny, the
reestablishment of Kappa
Sigma would be a danger to
public welfare because:

(1) students who attend Lex-
ington High School would pass
by the house and might possibly
be affected by fraternity social
functions ;

(2) the noise level of the
neighborhood would be substan-
tially increased;

(3) the neighborhood has
changed since Kappa Sigma
moved out of the house in 1970.
The current residents have
more children, Gianniny
claims;

(4) the fraternity could not
improve traffic flow or safety;

SAC Adopts

by Steve Perry

Several weeks ago, Sigma Phi
Epsilon was charged with a
violation of section 15-33 of the
Lexington. penal code. If you
haven’t guessed by now, the
SPE’s were issued a summons
for a noise violation.

But while this charge is quite
common for fraternities, the
resulting sentence was not. The
SPE’s were given no social pro
bation and paid only a $10 fine.

A fraternity is charged with a
noise violation when its
amplified music can be heard
more than 50 feet away from the
point of origin. The complaint
may come from a neighbor, as
in the SPE case, or from the ar-

(5) litter from the fraternity
would be a hazard to the
neighborhood.

Defense of the permit request
was given by Bill Lemon, a
Kappa Sigma. Lemon also
noted that the acquisition of the

University
Improving
Security

by W. Cope Movers
Executive Committee Presi-
dent Bob Willis Monday night
released a letter from Dean of
Students Lewis G. John outlin-
ing recent steps taken by the
university to improve campus

security.
The letter, dated March 18
and sent to Willis, was in

response to numerous student
complaints and an Executive
Committee investigation into
problems with security for the
entire university community.

Among action taken by Presi-
dent Huntley and the university
administration is the hiring of
an additional security staff
member, planned installation of
new lighting around the univer-
sity, and a training session for
security personnel, according
to John’s letter.

The hiring of another security
person brings to three the
number now working at the
university. Two have now been
hired in the past year, accor-
ding to John’s letter, and work
with university proctor Bob
Murray patrolling student park-
ing lots, the fraternity houses,
and other areas of the campus.

In addition to the hiring of a
third security person, the
university has also made a
“complete survey”? of campus
lighting with plans to install
new pole lights on the Wilson
Field footbridge and on the foot-
path to Lewis Hall.

According to the letter, the
university is also working to en-
sure that there is adequate
lighting around the campus.

A training session for campus
security personnel was also
held with Lexington Police
Chief J.A. Kirby. John’s letter

Social Probation Policy

resting officer.

After a fraternity has been
charged with a noise violation,
it is given a date to appear in
court. If the fraternity is found
guilty, it is given a mandatory
two weeks of social probation
by the IFC,

Sigma Phi Epsilon appeared
in court two weeks ago for its
misdemeanor. The SPE’s hoped
for dismissal on the grounds
that they had an excellent
record with the Lexington
Police Department.

In addition, SPE claimed that
it never received a warning
to turn down the music. Upon
hearing the case, the attending

judge issued SPE a minimal
fine of $10.

Although the fraternity was
given two weeks social proba-
tion by the IFC, the sentence
was later suspended by the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee. Again,
the reasoning was the SPE’s
record with the police depart-
ment,

IFC President Monte Briscoe
Stated that the SAC is now in
augurating a policy by which
social probation can be reduced
if a fraternity has a satisfactory
conduct record, In this way,
fraternities may stand a better
chance in battling noise viola-
tions,

CLS Spokesperson

Are there alternatives to
litigation? Should a lawyer ever
advise his or her olients not to
go to court? Is it a legitimate
part of a lawyer’s work to make
peace rather than fan the
flames of discontent? These are
among the questions which
Lynn Buzzard, Executive
Director of the Christian Legal
Society (CLS), will address in
his talk Thursday afternoon,
April 2, at Lewis Hall. The exact
time and location will be an-
nounced later.

Film Society Shows Bunuel

by Carren Osna Kaston

The Washington and Lee Film
Society will next show its first
Luis Bunuel film, the serio-
comic That Obscure Object of
Desire (Spain/France, 1977).
The movie will be screened on
Friday and Saturday, March 27
and 28, at 8 p.m. in classroom
‘**A”’ of Lewis Hall, free of
charge.

Bunuel’s long career in
movies has roots in his early
associations in Madrid with
Garcia Lorca, the Spanish poet
and playwright, and Salvador
Dali, the surrealist painter.
With Dali, Bunuel directed the
most famous avant-garde film
ever made, Un Chien Andalou
— (An Andalusian Dog)
(France, 1929). In its best-
known scene, Bunuel slits open
a woman’s eye with a razor in
order to shock the viewer into a

Student Art
Exhibit Opens

by Amory LeCuyer

The Fine Arts Department of
W&L will hold the annual stu-
dent art show exhibiting the
works completed in the first and
second semesters. The opening
of the exhibition will be Mon-
day, March 30 and will show
through April 17 in the DuPont
Gallery. A reception will be
held on April 3rd in the gallery,
from 5 p.m. to7 p.m.

The show will display the
works of students from Pro-
fessor Ju’s studio art and print
classes and Professor MclIlvain
drawing classes. Professor Ju
(artist-in-residence at W&L)
expresses that students are en-
couraged just to try. The result
is a wide variety of works in
several different medium and
styles.

The students showing will be
Frank Billingsley, Bill Comer,
Barry Eckert, Skip Epperson,
David Favrot, Randy George,
Kevin Kirky, G. Amory

new, uncensored level of
awareness.

Drawing on Freudian insights
into the unconscious,  sur-
realism thus confronts the spec-
tator with a world of illogic,
nightmare, fantasy, and forbid-
den images. The intention is to
dislocate the viewer, attacking
his position in an. artifically
stable, morally repressive
culture. Bunuel does this best
by combining surrealism with
social satire.

While Dali’s surrealist art has
become mired in repetitiveness
and a juvenile pursuit of the
bizarre and shocking, Bunuel’s
surrealist inclincations have
matured over the years in a
series of popular masterpieces.
These include  Viridiana
(Spain/Mexico, 1961), The Ex-
terminating Angel (Mexico,

1962), Belle de Jour (France,

In In Obscure Object of
Desire, Bunuel, as before, twits
society for the conventionaliz-
ing pieties which keep its life
safe, dishonest and boring. This
flamboyant movie focuses on a
man whose middle-class
moralism is tested by his con-
frontation with revolutionary
politics and an incendiary fan-
tasy woman.

The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1972) Pretty raw. A crude se-
quence of violent gore that has become something of a cult film,
with absolutely no artistry, social redemption or any of that stuff.
Probably the granddaddy of the current genre of mindless gut epics
(Terror Train, Fun House) now filling the screen, Guess the SAB

they're probably right. A light little entertainment to relieve the

Madame Rosa (France, 1977) Simone Signoret supposedly used
to make men melt, but it must have been many moons ago. In Ship
of Fools (1965) she looked awfully puffed up, and now she

which premiered earlier this
month. This matinee perfor-
mance will also be telecast live

Commentary:

 

The NFL Draft

by Ralph Frasca

Having only recently
recovered from the Oakland
Raiders’ tidy, definitive, and
absolute pasting of the
Philadelphia Eagles (I,
sagacious bettor that I am, had
my moolah on those bastions of
Brotherly Love), it occurs to me
that frenzied football action has
not yet gone into estivation. On-
ly three weeks away looms the
NFL College Player Draft.

The New Orleans Saints, by
virtue of their incomparable in-
competence, their unflagging
flaccidity, not to mention their
malapropos mediocrity, have
earned the first draft choice.
They plan to draft former South
Carorlina Gamecock and
Heisman Trophy Winner
George Rogers, a running back
of generous skills, who no doubt
will demand an overwhelming-
ly generous contract. If the
Saints pick Rogers, can’t you
just see a wild horde of beer-
guzzling sports aficionados,
veritable denizens of the cheap
seats, forming a rowdy Rogers
rooting section? What would

they call themselves? You
guessed _ it Mr. Rogers’
Neighborhood.

The second choice belongs to
one of the most curious teams in
the league, the New York
Giants. Not only are they wholly
unable to name themselves pro-
perly (years of playing in the
Meadowlands is enough time
for even the Maras to realize
that the club plays in New
Jersey), but they have had vir-
tually no success with first-
round draft choices. Although
Phill Simms has_ performed
adequately thus far, Giants fans
still groan when such deadwood
as Rocky Thompson, John
Hicks, and Eldridge Small
come to mind. Yes, Wellington
Mara, they were No, 1 draft
choices, and you can't deny it.

The question of whom the
Giabts will victimi- oops, I
mean draft, is quite interesting.
Pitt's Hugh Green looms as a
choice plum, and will probably
be chosen should the Giants
decide to create trade bait. If
they draft for their own specific
needs, the Giants will overlook
Green, for the last place the
Giants need help is the defense,
the defensive line in particular.
No, better they should opt for an
offensive player. Although far
from stable, the line has fewer
woes than other offensive sta-
tions. With Ernest Gray, Jim-
my Perkins, and recent Lions
acquisition Mike Friede,
nicknamed “The Great White

Hope,”’ the receiving corps is
satisfactory. Phil Simms. is,
well, Phil Simms, and any fair-
haired youth from the torpid
confines of Moorhead State Col-
lege who has the requisite skills
to quarterback an NFL team
(albeit the Giants) for two
years deserves a third try. In-
cumbent kicker Joe Danelo's
skills, with the exception of the
first half of last season, are
rarely found lacking, and he
will be challenged by current
W&L baseball coach Craig
Jones. Tight end Jerry Shirk
will hang on to his spot for
another year, and no one will
take the punting job from Dave
Jennings.

If you've been keeping track,
you'd know that I left out one
position. The Giants need run-
ning backs.

Oh, how the Giants wish New
Orleans would somehow
overlook George Rogers! Oh,

‘how the Saints lick their chops

in gleeful anticipation of not on-
ly acquiring the agile Mr.
Rogers, but snubbing the Giants
as well! Where will this leave
the boys from the Meadow-
lands? Why, in the NFC East
cellar of course, just like last
year.

Undaunted, the Giants will
probably settle for running
back James Brooks, an Auburn
product, to complete a ‘‘book
end’’ backfield: two short,
squat, bowling ball backs (the
other being Billy Taylor). What
do you expect from a team that
plays in the wrong state?

The New York Jets have the
third pick. Despite their uncan-
ny ability to land top-notch col-
lege ‘‘names” (Richard Todd,
Marvin Powell, Lam Jones are
a few recent examples), they
can’t seem to win very often.
There is an excellent possibility
that the Jets will tab Hugh
Green, for the Jets’ top two
choices of two years ago, defen-
sive lineman Mark Gastineau
and Marty Lyons, have not
lived up to expectations.
Besides, Hugh Green is a
“name.”

Seattle Seahawk coach Jack
Patera will be looking for
defense in the college draft, and
may select UCLA safety Ken
Easely or Green’s defensive
line partner, Randy McMillian,
as NFL pick number four.

The only team who flopped as
drastically as the Jets last year
was the St. Louis Cards, picking
in the fifth spot. They should be
looking for quarterbacks to
replace the fading Jim Hart,
and will probably come up with
Purdue's Mark Herrmann. Neil

Netmen Suffer Three Losses

by Dale Park

It has been rough going so far
this season for the Washington
and Lee varsity tennis team and
head coach Gary Franke.

Last Friday, March 20, the
W&L netmen hosted NCAA
Division II California State Col-
lege and lost a close 5-4 deci-
sion. Singles winners for the
Generals included senior co-
captain Pete Lovell at first
singles and junior Wes Yonge at
the fourth flight. In doubles,
Lovell joined with classmate
and fellow co-captain Doug
Gaker for a 6-2, 6-0 victory at
first doubles, while Yonge com-
bined with sophomore Steve
Denny for a 6-0, 6-2 win at the
second flight.

California State proved to be
the easiest team that the W&L
netmen faced all weekend. The
next day the Generals traveled
to Davidson College, a Division
I school, and were gobbled up
9-0. Although no W&L player
really threatened in his match,
Franke explained that ‘“‘we beat
Davidson in a tough 5-4 match
last year at home. This year we
played them much earlier in the
season and also we had to play
them on their clay courts — and
we don’t get to play on clay.”’

March 22 found the Generals
at home again against another

Lax Team Loses to Wolfpack

The Washington and Lee
lacrosse team, which found
itself ‘‘doubled-up’’ in defeat
this past Saturday, will travel to
Towson, Md. on Saturday,
March 28 to face Towson State
University in hopes of earning a
tenth straight win over the
Tigers. The Generals will take a
1-1 record, the Tigers an 0-2
mark, into the 7:30 p.m. con-
test.

‘Towson State is always com-
petitive with us, which makes
for a great series,’ says W&L
head coach Jack Emmer of the
game, the 18th meeting in a
series which the Generals lead,
12-5. “This year’s contest will
be interesting not only due to
this competitiveness, but also
because we've got two teams
which suffered convincing

losses last weekend and which
would each like to turn things
around.”’

W&L will look to rebound
from a 20-10 setback at the
hands of North Carolina State in
a game which took place Satur-
day, March 21 in Raleigh.
Towson, meanwhile, will open
its home schedule with hopes of
erasing a 19-3 loss to North
Carolina, which took place
March 21 at Chapel Hill. The
Tiger’s other loss is a 15-9 ver-
dict to Loyola on March 18.

“Our main concern in the
game will be for our players to
concentrate on their perfor-
mances, and for them to have a
proper attitude for this and
future contests,’’ the Generals’
ninth-year director stated.

‘*A lot of good teams pick up a

 

 

Track Meet Cancelled

The Washington and Lee
track team was thwarted in at-
tempting to even its record at
the Richmond Relays last
Saturday. The meet was
cancelled.

According to coach Norris
Aldridge, the contractor who
was slated to resurface the

University of Richmond’s track
before the season fell behind
schedule, and informed the U of
R that the only possible time to
resurface the track was last
weekend. Otherwise, theschool
would have to wait until next
year. Hence, the cancellation of
the meet.

loss early in the season, but the
truly good teams can come
back from a loss and be on top
at the end of the season. We
hope our players will keep this
in mind.”

Against the Wolfpack, W&L
had comeback on its mind
before the hosts ran off eight
consecutive scores. The
Generals battled from a 7-3 first
quarter deficit to close within
one, 8-7, early in the third
period. At that point, however,
N.C, State ran off the eight
tallies to take command and
take its first win in seven tries
against W&L.

“‘We knew they were an ex-
plosive team, but we also knew
we could control this

characteristic by putting the

ball in the goal ourselves,’’ Em-
mer offered. ‘‘But they beat us
on the ground balls (71-53), ex-
ecuted well in unsettled situa-
tions, and did well in the
faceoffs. Once they got that
type of game going, they were
tough. Our comeback didn’t
give us all the momentum we
needed.”’

The W&L offensive efforts
were keyed by seniors, the most
notable of whom was mid-
fielder Geoff Brent with three
goals and three assists to earn
the team’s Player-of-the-Game
honor. Attackman Pere Roberts
added two goals, midfielders
George Santos and John Kemp
a goal and assist each.
Two W&L Students Spend Extra Time
As Coaches Of VMI’s Lacrosse Club

by Rick Swagler

Every weekday afternoon at
4, W&L Senior Biff Hearn pulls
up to the practice field behind
VMI’s stadium in his old Buick.

At the same time, Ben
Muskin, a W&L junior, walks
across the two campuses to the
same field. There, nestled be-
teen the back of the stadium
and some houses on a nearby
hill, they coach VMI’s lacrosse
club. Although Hearn and
Muskin are the same age as
many of the players, they have
little trouble getting respect.

This year the team will only
graduate four seniors Clarkson
Meredith, and captains Peter
Nauta, Bruce Gitchell and
Mark Spears. As Gitchell said:
“They’re good coaches but
there’s not the same discipline.
Everybody’s out here to have
fun. Biff and Ben are pretty
laid-back.”’

All three captains would like
for the team to go varsity, but
they are happy with its club
status.

Nauta stated that ‘a lot of
people get to play, we aren’t
under a lot of pressure to win
and we aren’t so restricted as
varsity. Everybody’s out here
to have fun and utilize their
talent. We like it the way itis.”

One player who wished to re-
main anonymous said that

‘‘nobody wants to go varsity.’’
-He continued: ‘‘If we were to go
varsity, there would be too
many regulations.”’

According to Captain Mark
Spears, ‘‘the administrators is
leaning toward giving us more
money, but they don’t want to
support us unless they do so
completely. We'll be pretty
respectable if we get the
money. We want to be able to
play W&L, U.Va. and Roanoke
College without being em-
barassed.”’

The team is very appreciative
of the time and effort Muskin
and Hearn are putting into the
club. Spears remarked that
‘‘they make a good team. Biff is
good with overall strategy
whereas Ben is good with the
technical aspect of the game.”’
Spears commented that the two
coaches are both calm and
level-headed at all times.

Biff Hearn played two years
of junior varsity lacrosse for
W&L, but, in his words, ‘‘was

‘never able to play varsity.”’ It

was at this time that Howard
Smith called him and asked
Hearn if he would like to be an
assistant lacrosse coach.

When asking why he coached,
Hearn said “‘its fun and rewar-
ding. I know that sounds like a
‘‘typical’’ answer but I’ve found
that it’s really true.’”’

Hearn says that VMI is being
more cooperative this year
compared to last in that the club
now has its own field. Hearn's
only negative comment about
the club was “‘its lack of depth.”

Ben Muskin also tried out for
W&L’s lacrosse team after hav-
ing a successful soccer season
but was one of Jack Emmer’s
early cuts. Muskin harbors no
ill feelings to Emmer, commen-
ting that “‘he’s an excellent
coach.’ There were other peo-
ple available who could give the
team more than I could.”’

Muskin is primarily an offen-
sive coach although he will pro-
bably be the head coach next
year if the team still has a club
status. Said Muskin: “‘It’s a lot
different on the other side of the
whistle, When you’re a player,
you can hide in a group if you're
not performing well. But as a
coach, you have to be at your
prime all of the time.”’

Although the club is just that
— a club — the players take
their sport seriously. Just as in
a varsity sport, tempers flare
occassionally. The team and the
coach are, however, on a first-
name basis, which seems to im-
prove cooperation.

And in their first game, which
was played Saturday, the team
defeated Ferrum.

Golfers Finish 13th In Tournament

by Scott Mason

Hampered by 82-mile-an-hour
winds and a driving rain, the
Washington and Lee golf team
could claim only a disappoint-
ing 13th place of 18 par-
ticipating colleges in a two-day
NCAA District III, Division III
tournament held in Greensboro,

es

 

 

rerry Barousse

North Carolina this past
weekend.

The Generals did not perform
as well as Coach Buck Leslie
would have liked. At the end of
the first day of the tournament,
the Generals finished in a tie for
fourteenth place. But with help

from ‘senior co-captain Gerry

  
   

Barousse, the team climbed
from fourteenth to tenth posi-
tion on the second day,
cumulatively resulting in the
13th place finish.

Despite the setback, Coach
Leslie is confident. However,
his main worry seems to be in
filling spots 4, 5, and 6 on the
team ladder, and it appears
now that Steve Everett, Jerry
Moyer, Tom Wohlfarth, Del
Agnew, Bruce Blythe, and
Steve Jones are all very much
in contention. The team’s worst
enemy at this point, says Coach
Leslie, is a ‘‘lack of concentra-
tion among the players.’’ Due to
academic pressures, along with
the fact that it is still early in
the season, the golfers seem
very unsettled. ‘‘With hard
work,’’ emphasises Leslie,
“team stability will come.”’

The Generals’ faced
Bridgewater and Shepherd col-
leges today at the Lexington
Country Club golf course. The
team’s next match takes place
on April 17 and 18, where they
will compete in the Virginia
Tech ‘Gobbler Classic.’’ We
can look for improved strides in
the Generals’ performance and
hopefully a season as equally
successful as their 13-3 record
of a year ago. As Coach Leslie
states, ‘‘It’s too early to put the
hammer down yet,” for the
Generals are very much alive
and kicking.

 

 

As the Washington and Lee
baseball team continues its Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
competition this week with a
Thursday, March 26, home
game and a Saturday, March
28, road doubleheader, head
coach Craig Jones will be look-
ing for an aggressive necessary
if the Generals are to appear in
the ODAC Championship Tour-
nament. W&L, which owns 5-4
overall and 2-3 conference
marks, is hoping for a first-ever
appearance in the Tournament,
which is set for April 25.

“We've got the talent, the
skill to be contenders for this
tournament,”’ Jones begins, *‘so
it will simply come down to
whether we've got the hunger,
the fight, and the agressiveness
to make it. We need a killer-
instinct type of attitude, no mat-
ter what the scoreboard may
show.”

W&L's Thursday conference
encounter is at 3 p.m. against
Bridgewater College. Satur-
day's trip is to Maryville Col-
lege. In addition, the Generals
will be hosts for two non-
conference games this week: a
3 p.m. contest on Wednesday,

March 25, against Lock Haven
State, and a 3 p.m. contest on
Monday, March 30 against Col-
gate University. Following the
Colgate game, W&L is off from
action until April 14.

In action last week, W&L
bowed to defending ODAC
champion Lynchburg 13-2 on
Friday, March 20 and split with
conference foe Emory & Henry
on Saturday, March 21, losing
the opener 13-3 and taking the
nightcap 11-8. Last Tuesday, the
Generals split a doubleheder
with ODAC rival Randolph-
Macon. The Generals won the

opener, 6-4. R-M_ took the
nightcap, 3-1.
According to Jones, top

Generals in the game were:
first-baseman Jeff Haggerty,
who collected his third home
run of the season in the E&H
doubleheader ; second-baseman
Chris Cavalline, the team’s
leading hitter with a_ .480
average; lefthanded-pitcher
Jim Halprin, who earned the
win against Emory & Henry;
and catcher Tripp Brower,
“who is giving us excellent
defensive play,’ says the
coach.

Bernot, Rock Honored

by Phil Murray

Junior Mike Bernot and
freshman Tim Rock attained
All-America honors last
weekend at the NCAA Division
III Swimming Championships
in Oberlin, Ohio.

Bernot, of Hampton, Va.,
became the second man in
Washington and Lee swimming
history to capture the honor in
three individual events. Rock,
of San Antonio, Texas, earned
his honor in one of the two
events in which he was entered.

Bernot set two W&L school
records and a career best on his
way to an outstanding perfor-
mance. He finished fourth in the
90-yard freestyle event with a
21.40. However, he set the new
record at 21.33 during the
preliminaries. In the 100-yard
free, Bernot placed third and
broke his own school record
with a 46.63 time. His career
best came in the 200-yard free,
in which he finished 10th in the
competition. His time of 1:44.09

was also good enough to tie the
existing school record.

Rock’s distinction came in the
1650-yard free in which he
placed fifth with a 16:17.27. He
also competed in the 500-yard
free.

The 400-yard relay team, the
only other General entrant,
rounded out the year with a
season-best time. The team of
Bernot, junior Herb Gresens,
and freshmen Jeff Gee and
Gary Meyer turned in a 3:13.98
to finish 15th in the competition.

Obviously happy with the per-
formance, Coach Page
Remillard saw the Champion-
ships as a sign of continuing im-
provement in the W&L aquatic
program.

‘This sort of national recogni-
tion draws fine student-athletes
to W&L,”’ he said. “I think this
is a real indication of how well
we can do in dual meet competi-
tion next year.”’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Hitting a Low Note

The Washington and Lee Record Store, located in
the basement of the book store, officially closed as of
2:00 p.m. today. University Treasurer E. Stewart
Epley Bookstore Manager Betty Munger made their
decision to close the store for two reasons: the store
was losing money and store managers seldom stayed
around for more than a year or two. Yet only a few
hours after the closing announcement was made, pe-
tions to reconsider the decision were posted around
the campus. Only a few hours after the petitions ap-
peared on campus, they had several hundred
signatures. Signatures in the early stages were
balanced with faculty members and students both ac-
tively supporting keeping the record store open.

The petition, directed to President Huntley (see ‘‘A
Request For President Huntley”’ on this page), makes
several good points, but the bottom line of the petition
and thrust of the argument are the same; a record
store with a variety of material is an important con-
tribution to the liberal education. The record store
may lose money, but this is a university for learning,
not a corporation out to make a profit every year. We
agree with the petition and believe that the Record
Store should not be closed. Nearly any alternative to
closing the store would be better tor the university
than depriving its students, faculty, administrators
and other employees of this important service.
Washington and Lee should support the Record Store
for the same reasons it supports other organizations
which habitually lose money while providing an in-
valuable service.

If the location of the record store is a problem,
move it to the basement of the Student Center. The
former music room is a large area in the Student
Center which is not being used. Many schools have a
book exchange run by the students. Is there any
reason Washington and Lee could not try a record
store managed and manned by students? Students on
the work-study program could be used to run the
operation or the project could be handled as a
seperate job. Perhaps a combination record
store/book exchange would work. We think that any
alternative to the present situation of no store at all
will represent an improvement. We urge President
Huntley to reconsider the decision to close the
Bookstore.

The Security Report

Having complained of security deficiences for the
majority of this year, it comes as a relief to see that
the university has taken affirmative steps in trying to
solve this campus’s safety problems. The recent let-
ter sent from Dean of Students Lewis John to E.C
President Bob Willis is a reassurance that the ad-
ministration is indeed aware of the problem and
wants to end it.

We can only hope that this is the first of many such
measures to come. By adding members to its security
staff and improving lighting around campus, the
university is making the campus safer for all of us.
That is one idea no one can disagree with.

Too, the Bookstore has had an

tion to that education.

The record store is the only
place in Lexington where facul-
ty, students and townspeople
can purchase recordings of
classical and other fine music
at affordable prices. The clos-
ing of the store would effective-
ly deny the community the op-
portunity to explore and pur-
chase anything other than cur-
rent hits.

We believe the university
should support the record store
in the same way and for the
same reasons that it supports
the book store, the glee club, the
theatre, the speakers’ bureau
and similar organizations. If
the university is, nevertheless,
unable to accept the small an-
nual deficit accumulated by the
store, we request that rather
than close the store, the univer-
sity consider ways to improve
its operation.

We will be happy to meet with
you to discuss our request with
you in greater detail.

SABU’s
Program
Lauded

Dear Editor:

Last Wednesday night in Lee
Chapel, Mrs. Mignon Holland
Anderson read and discussed
one of her works of fiction as
part of the SABU-sponsored
Black Emphasis Month ac-
tivities.

As one member of the very
small crowd (of 20 or less) in at-
tendance at what amounted to
an impressive and moving
dramatic reading, I have to say
it’s a real shame that the crowd
wasn’t a whole lot larger. Mrs.
Anderson’s views on the effects
of racism in black-white rela-
tions deserved to reach a wider
audience.

SABU has my admiration for
arranging a notable series of
events focusing on subjects too
rarely considered in the W&L
environment.

Sincerely,
Will Jackson ’83
 

| Group Plans May
Anti-War Rally

To the Editor:

The People’s Anti-War
Mobilization (PAM), a broad
coalition of hundreds _ of!
organizations and individuals:
across the country as well as
other anti-war and progressive
groups have joined forces to
call for a massive demonstra-
tion on the Pentagon on May
3rd. The activity will protest the
U.S. war build-up, the increased
U.S. intervention in El
Salvador, and the wide budget
cuts by the Reagan administra-
tion.

Campuses nationwide have
been one of the largest
mobilizers for the May 3rd ac-
tivity. Student Coordinator Ray
Nandar, stated, ‘“‘The response
of the campuses’and students
has been phenomenal.”’ Student
government and other campus
organizations at schools like
Norfolk State, Fisk in Ten-
nessee, in Madison, Wisc., in
Boston and Amherst Mass., and
the University Senate of CUNY
(which covers over 170,000
students) have seen the impor-
tance of this march and have
actively begun building for it. It
can be the largest national
march in a decade.

“Students,” Ray continued,
“‘see that the money that is be-
ing taken from education and
social services is being used to
buy bullets to kill the people of
El Salvador. We will not stand
for it.”

Numerous press conferences
have been held across the coun-

 

try; coverage has been seen in
Atlanta, New Jersey; Norfolk,
Chicago, New York and other
cities.

PAM has available materials,
speakers, and is available for
interviews. Funds are also
urgently needed. Please call

The Great Gymnasium Cockroach Olympics

If I were a cockroach, I think Lexington would be a grand place to
live. And of all the plush hatching grounds that cater to roaches,
none would be more deliciously inviting than Washington and Lee’s
Doremus gymnasium. The accomodations would be perfect.

Just imagine the possibility of the annual Cockroach Olympics.
There would be a series of events to test the endurance, cunning,
and dexterity of the world’s most prolific creatures. The first event
would be the Dust Skating Roachathon, where we would don our lit-
tle roach skates and with a certain abandon and cockrobatic grace,
glide over the ancient film of dust and grease — through the rac-
quetball courts, up the walls, and up the stairs. The first million
roaches to reach the men’s lockerroom would compete in the next
event, while the losers could feast on the scrumptious mountains of
spittle that garnish the halls.

Strengthened by the powerful odors that pervade the lockerroom,
the roaches are now ready for the great Cockswim. The object here
is to splash enough water out of the stagnant pools in the shower
stalls so that the roaches can eat the hair that stops up the drains.
Washington and Lee gentlemen have truly delicious locks, but
nothing can compare to the fine flavor of hair that has molded in
drains for years and years.

After the Cockswim, comes the Fungi-Lick. For those who sur-
vived the great whirlpool (resulting from the sanitary drainage
system), the Fungi-Lick is one of cocksport’s greatest games. Dex-
terity of the tongue is the key to cleaning the bathroom floors of
Athlete’s Foot fungi (not to mention jock itch). But since the
bathrooms haven’t been cleaned in years, the roaches would have
to take time out and pump some iron. Welcome to the great
Cockpump Contest! And as you might have guessed, this is basical-
ly the most invigorating form of reproduction available to.roaches.
At any rate, strengthened in number and body, the roaches now
have no problem lapping up the tasty fungi that seem to carpet the
lockerroom tiles.

Yes, I would love to be a cockroach. I could feel as though J had
done my civic duty: the gym would be clean! After all, with
cockroaches, who needs janitors? But this is not the point; indeed I
neglected to inform you of the last event in the Cockroach Olym-
pics. After eating with such rabid abandon, cockroaches do, indeed
excrete, The roaches would march, en masse, to the fourth floor of
fices and leave their heroic droppings on the desk of your favorit
administrator.

Onp SMITH The Ring-tum Phi, March 26, 1981, Page 7

 

Dear Editor:

In the March 19, 1981 issue of
the Ring-tum Phi you included
an editorial titled ‘“E.C. Cam-
paigns.”’ I have the following
complaints:

1. The editorial concerned my
campaign only.

2. I was taken out of context.
The editorial stated only one
sentence from my poster, and

reply. The item was printed on when it is based on a series of

the Thursday before the elec-
tion, and any reply could only
be printed on the Thursday
following the election.

4. In the editorial, my cam-
paign is dismissed as a joke.
Strangely enough, my cam-
paign was one of two which, as
far as I can tell, actually stated
what the candidate would do
once in office. How can any
campaign be called serious

eye-catching yet meaningless
posters?

In conclusion, I can only state
that whoever wrote the article
must not have thought out the
editorial before submitting it.
The fact that you, as editor-in-
chief, didn’t examine it more
closely is a reasonable cause to
cite irresponsibility on your
part.

Yours truly,
Ralph Dosser

 

The editorial opinion of the Ring-tum Phi is generally agreed
upon by a group of senior staff members. Our final opinion is exact-
ly that, an opinion. The editorial which has incensed Messrs.
Dosser and Vaughan sought to address a problem we saw and still
see as Salient; you really cannot joke around when it comes down to
administering the honor system and handing out student body
funds. We simply picked out Dosser’s poster claim that if elected,
he would try to do as little as possible as an example for out point.
As for Chip Vaughan’s charge that Todd Smith’s cartoon lampoon-
ed Ralph Dosser’s campaign, we can only say that if one reads the
cartoon they will notice that Smith's candidate is running for re-
election. Ralph Dosser was not running for re-election.

furiated by your ‘‘paper’’, as

straw that broke this camel’s
back. For you to criticize one of
the E.C. candidates’ campaign
gimmicks just before the elec-
tion proves, at least to me, just
how unprofessional and tactless
you are. You showed your
readers, by this act, that you
are definitely not unbiased
reporters trying to present your
readers with an impartial view
of the election and the can-
didates but rather you showed

 

you call it,.in the past, but yo ur
editorial last week was the

nable propogandists.Surely you
must have realized that your
editorial could adversely affect
Mr. Dosser’s campaign! If not,
how then, did you get into this
university with such an obvious
lack of intelligence and com-
mon sense? I may not agree
with Mr. Dosser’s political
philosophy but I do believe that
his campaign, and whatever
campaign slant he chooses to
use, should be given as fair a

shake as all the other cam-
paigns and their particular gim-

micks. Further, I found Mr.
Smith’s cartoon equally as

that the cartoon was aimed

specifically against Mr. Dosser

and his campaign. Mr. Smith

must either be your pawn or

your equal. I have found that

the candidates and their cam-

paigns for this upcoming elec-

tion, including Mr. Dosser’s,

have been particularly in-

teresting in their variety and

enthusiasm and none of them

deserve the lampooning you

gave Mr. Dosser’s. I can tell |
you this; you have lost at least |
one reader. |

Kappa Sigma Denied Special Use

house is vital to the survival of
the fraternity.

“TI don’t know if we were
outstanding neighbors, but I do
know that we didn’t receive any
complaints,’’ said Lemon, who
was at one time a_ house
manager for the fraternity. “I
think these boys share the same
interest.”

Lemon mentioned that he as a
participant in a group that
would finance the purchase of
the house. Called Mu House
Corporation, the backers in-
clude Lemon and Dr. Frederick
Fedderman. If the permit is ob-
tained, said Lemon, the group
will receive a $65,000 long-term
loan from the university to
remodel the property and refur-
bish the house.

Lemon said that under the ar-
rangement, the Kappa Sigmas
would be watched by a house
mother. Lemon also said that he
was impressed by the current
members of the fraternity.

Other support for the fraterni-
ty was given by Bruce Myers a
law student at W&L. “We have
looked through Lexington high-
and-low,”’ said Myers. “If you
say ‘no’ to a fraternity at 516
Main St., then what’s implied is
‘no’ to a fraternity in any
residential district.”

Mrs. Charles Friedman, who
has lived in the house for the
past eight years, said that she is

unable to maintain the facility
and would like to sell it to Kap-

can maintain the house.

One resident of the
neighborhood, Mrs. Pat Ran-

But the strongest language
was provided by Arthur Adams,
a resident of 6 Edmondson Ave.,
which is located a_half-block
from the proposed fraternity
site.

 

“Fraternities in Lexington have a

long history of abuse against their

own property. Why should we be

subjected to another fraternity?”

dolph, did speak in favor of the
permit. ‘‘With fraternities, you
get the type of neighbors you
yourself are,’’ said Mrs. Ran-
dolph.

After this point, however, the
statements began to go against
the Kappa Sigmas’ bid. One
such critic was G.P. Whiteley, a
member of the neighborhood.
Whiteley’s criticism was
‘‘because of parties, because of
the record of other fraternities,
because of the possibility that
this area would become
blighted.’’ There is the chance
that other fraternities might
move to nice areas,’ said
Whiteley.

“It wasn’t quite as nice and
quiet as it really was,’ con-
tinued Whiteley. ‘I’m sorry for
the owner, but I’m afraid that if
this happens, the community
will change and we will not be
able to sell our home.”’

‘Fraternities in Lexington
have a long history of abuse
against their own property,”’
said Adams. “‘I see no reason to
have another place where they
can literally destroy at will the
responsible few who cannot con-
trol the mob.”

Adams claimed that on party
weekends, ‘‘with crowds of 150,
broken windows, broken _bot-
tles, fraternity behavior in this
town has been reprehensible
and offensive.”’ ‘‘Why should we
be subjected to another frater-
nity,” asked Adams.

Adams then gave a recent ex-
ample, in which, he claimed,
“the fraternity by the post of-
fice literally covered the street
in broken glass.”’ Adams said
he rode across the street at 8:15
a.m. and called the police two
hours later. Adams said that the
police forced some fraternity
members to clean up the glass.

“I said: “Did you charge
them?’’ and the police said:
‘‘No, not this time.’’ “‘Well, how
many times do you have to do it
before you get charged?”

Adams claimed that bottles
were thrown from 516 Main St.
in 1970 and, in 1968, a football
was kicked through every win-
dow of the house.

“Fraternity behavior is
reprehensible, offensive and
cannot be tolerated,” continued
Adams. ‘I thought Washington
and Lee was going to exert
more control over fraternities
this year. Apparently, they
have not.”’

‘Sentimental reasons will not
suffice for putting them back in

Permit

that house. Housing shortages
will not suffice. The zoning laws
will not suffice. What matters
here is what’s right and what’s
wrong.’

Thursday’s decision
represents the second of three
possible steps Kappa Sigma can
take to obtain a special use per-
mit. The only option now left to
the fraternity is an appeal to a
circuit court.

In order to overturn City
Council’s decision, Kappa
Sigma would have to prove that
the Council’s decision was, in
some way, discriminating. A
spokesman for the fraternity
said that his group has not yet
made any plans for an appeal.

 

EC

(continued from page 1)
said that cooperation and com-
munication with the Lexington
Police Department were em-
phasized at the meeting.

At Monday night’s EC
meeting, the committee also ap-
proved a motion giving the In-
ternational Club $75 for
organizational purposes.

The club, organized about two
months ago, is one of several in
the area. The club’s primary
purpose, according to president
Francisco Guzman, is to orien-

tate foreign students who come
to the university on American
culture and the Rockbridge
County area.

“The needs of foreign
students is much different than
those of American freshmen,
and it’s quite difficult for them
to learn about American
culture,’’ said Guzman.

In other business, Willis an-
nounced that petitions for the
April 1 EC election are due next
Monday.
