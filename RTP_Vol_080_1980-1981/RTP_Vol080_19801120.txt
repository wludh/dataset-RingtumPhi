Police Blotter

Requirements Eased By

Alternative Proposals

by W. Cope Moyers

In an effort to ease re-
quirements for amending the
student body constitution, the
Executive Committee Monday
night passed a motion revising
amendment procedures.

By an 8-4 vote, the committee
agreed to change current re-
quirements making passage of
any constitutional amendment
possible only when half the stu-
dent body votes. The new revi-
sion, should it be approved next
semester, would reduce the re-
quirement from 50 percent to 20
percent.

The changes, suggested by
Treasurer Willie Mackie, would
increase the number of votes
needed to approve an amend-
ment from 66 percent to three-
quarters. Voting would still
take place for three days but on-
ly two polling places would be
used.

The‘ committee’s action

followed last week’s rejection of .

eleven amendments that would
have, according to President
Bob Willis, made necessary
changes in the student body
constitution. Although all

Student Injured

by John Ran Smith
Several confrontations bet-
ween W&L students and local
youths occurred last weekend,
including one incident in which
a student was injured and
received medical treatment.

Five members of the Pi Kap-
pa Phi fraternity were return-
ing from the library to their
house around 1:30 Saturday
morning when they saw a group
of five youths .tearing down
clotheslines at the neighboring
Davidson Park Apartments, ac-
cording to Clyde Harkrader, the
president of Pi Phi.

The students went to stop the
locals from doing any more
damage, when they were

threatened by the youths said
Harkrader. Harkrader said he
then tried to get his friends to go
back to the fraternity house.

Harkrader received a biow to
the back of his head, which had
to be closed with stitches.

The police were called and ac-
cording to Harkrader, they said
that they knew the group.

Harkrader said one of the
youths has been identified, and
the students involved in the inci-
dent were going to identify the

other four juveniles on Wednes-
day.

Members of the Pi Kappa

Alpha house also had problems
with local youths Saturday mor-
ning.
According to Russell Stall,
the Social chairman at PiKA,
some high school-aged locals
entered their fraternity house
during a party.

“I think there were five high
school kids,” said Stall. ‘‘We
caught them stealing liquor bet-
ween 12:30 and 1:00 a.m.”’ Stall
said that PiKA is going to press
charges.

Blair Pritchett, a member of
Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity,
said that a receiver, pre-amp,
and amp valued at $600 were
stolen from his car. He
discovered the theft Saturday
morning.

There were no signs of forced
entry, he said. ‘It was as if they
had a key,”’ he continued. There
was also a wallet with cash in it
on the console, but it was not
taken.

Pritchett said the police
believe they knew who was
responsible for the theft, but the
items have not yet been
recovered.

eleven amendments were ap-
proved by students, only 22 per-
cent of them voted.

Earlier in the meeting, EC
member Jim Vines suggested
that there be no requirements
about the number of students
needed to vote in the amend-
ment procedure and instead
suggested that any amendment
be ratified if it is approved by
three-quarters of the students
who vote.

Vines’ motion also called for
three voting places instead of
two. The motion failed 7-5 with
Mackie, Bud White, Eric
Myers, Ben Hale and Marshall
Clark voting against. Two-
thirds.is necessary for the EC to
approve a motion.

Myers objected to both Vines’
and Mackie’s motions, saying
that it would be too easy to
amend the constitution.

“It should be difficult to
change any constitution, not
easy,’’ Myers said. ‘You are
going to have a small part of the
school making some potentially
important decisions.’’

But other members of the
committee pointed to the last
two attempts at amending the
constitution, both of which fail-
ed because not enough of the
student body voted.

‘“‘We must accept the fact that
students won’t vote,’ EC
member Jeff Edwards said.

The committee agreed to
delay the student vote on the
proposed amendment until Spr-
ing Term registration next
semester:

In other business, Clark
reported on his discussion with
Lexington Police Chief J.A. Kir-
by concerning security for the
university community. Clark
said Kirby had expressed his
desire to work with W&L in an
effort to reduce the number of
crimes against students. Clark
labled the meeting ‘‘very con-
structive.”

Edwards told the committee
of another incident of violence
at Davidson Park last weekend
between students and area
residents. He expressed his
dissatisfaction with the lack of
university security at the park,
which houses a number of
students.

The committee heard the
monthly report from the Con-
tact Committee. Chairman
Scott Cardoza reported that
Contact had spent $6,184 and
that G. Gordon Liddy, a one-
time defendant in the
Watergate trials, will speak at
the university on Monday,
December 8.

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

An Apology...

We would like to apologize for an unclear sentence
in last week’s editorial. Although we were referring to
Dr. Merchant in the last sentence of ‘“‘One Bad Ap-
ple...”, some people took the sentence to mean a
recently departed member of the faculty. The
sentence meant Dr. Merchant and Dr. Merchant only.

One of the greatest American rights is the right to
be wrong. Journalists often breathe a sigh of relief
because of the First Amendment. Yet the right to be
wrong is one right the press relies on far too often, the
Ring-tum Phi included. While we do not think our
editorial was wrong, we realize there is no excuse for
leaving in a sentence which is unclear or misleading.
We promise to exercise our right to be wrong more

cautiously in the future.

Letter To The Editor

 

Junior Criticizes Ring-tum Phi

Gentlemen:

After having had the opportunity to read your
newspaper for three months I feel compelled to
comment upon it. As a product comprised of news
reporting, opinion writing, editing, layout, and
printing, the Ring-tum Phi without question fails
in all categories and in so doing misrepresents and
disgraces the university it serves. The issues are
consistently poor; further comment on the ill-
conceived and miserably written smut occasional-
ly appearing in the ‘Spectator’ column, which,
along with your questionable decision to print it,
has been attacked by others both in your pages
and privately sufficiently to encourage me to
believe that a not insignificant number of others in
the university community share a real concern for
the Ring-tum Phi. I will confine myself to a few
observations on the most recent issue (Nov. 13).

Your brief editorial declaration of your obliga-
tions as a newspaper is instructive, especially
when read together with the letter concerning

- your reportorial biases submitted by Robert M.

Ferguson, whose point is well taken and cannot be
overemphasized. Perhaps the key to understand-
ing the apparent contradiction between your state-
ment regarding objective reporting (and your
questionable claim to legitimacy based on this
“‘principle’’) and the treatment of the news article
to which Mr. Ferguson’s letter refers lies in the

- words “In this instance...” The implication is that

the editors of the Ring-tum Phi found themselves
with a news item so significant, so worthy of objec-
tive reporting, that they hastily drafted a limited
policy of ‘‘professional obligation,” applied it to
this news event (which so sparked the journalistic
fire presumably latent in the staff that not one but
three editorials, the total output for the week, in

LEXINGTON HARDWARE COMPANY

23 South Main Street

fact, were devoted to it), and were so proud of this
novel form of journalism that they felt the need to
use the editorial page to call it to public attention.
In other instances, one infers, you do not feel the
same duty to report ‘‘what actually happened.”

The most casual perusal of your newspaper
reveals myriad faults: Misspelled headlines
(“‘Alternitives’’ on page 1), headlines lacking
verbs (“Star Harrier’’), photographs without cap-
tions, abundant punctuation and spelling errors
throughout, and, perhaps the most maddening
feature of this particular issue, an article which
fails completely to address itself to the topic of its
headline. I refer to the headline on page 3: ‘‘Ante-
bellum Residence To Be Restored.” This article
further annoys by having no stated subject, begin-
ning and ending arbitrarily without ever having
made a point, and consisting almost entirely of ap-
parently quoted material whose sources are not
once identified.

Implicit in your function not only as the primary
means of news dissemination on this campus but
also as the University’s ambassador to the world
at large is an obligation to the University com-
munity to strive for excellence. Neither your
reportorial and editorial policies nor the careless
and inconsistent product which you produce ac-
curately reflects the tradition, attainments, and
ideals of Washington and Lee. I write this letter to
offer criticism which I deeply hope will encourage
you to re-examine your obligations and your craft
with an eye toward a publication which truly
serves and represents the Washington and Lee
community.

Sincerely,
Lawrence Norford

Generals End Season With Victory

by Dale Park

After an early defensive
breakdown, the Washington and
Lee varsity football team over-
powered the Georgetown Hoyas
in a season-ending 36-7 romp
last Saturday at Georgetown.

The Generals finished with a
6-4 season record, their first
winning mark since 1967.

Said head coach Gary Fallon:
“I’m very happy for my
players. We can finally touch
something substantial as proof
that our hard work has paid
off.”’ The last time the Generals
scored more points was in 1976,
when they defeated this same
Georgetown team, 43-12.

Not only did the W&L team
finish on a good note, but senior
slotback Chris Leiser ended his
impressive career with a 152-
yard, one touchdown perfor-
mance; the TD came on a 71-
yard touchdown dash early in
the fourth quarter.

“Chris will be tough to
replace,” commented Fallon.
“He did everything for us
—rushed, returned kickoffs and
punts, and he also set a good ex-
ample for the younger

players.”’
Things started off slowly for

_the Generals, as Georgetown
quarterback Tim Marotta
scrambled 70 yards on the first

   

play from scrimmage for a
touchdown, putting Georgetown
in front, 7-0.

“There was an initial mix-up
on defense on our part,”’ stated
Fallon. Against. Georgetown’s
‘“‘wishbone”’ offense, individual
assignments became more
complicated and no one picked
up the wingback on that first
play. But we straightened
things out right away.”’

The Generals’ defense did
straighten out, and for the next
59 minutes and 42 seconds the
Hoyas did not score again.

The Generals’ offense, how-
ever, had no trouble scoring.

Late in the first quarter W&L
nose-guard Mike Pressler tackl-
ed Marotta in the Hoya endzone
to cut the Georgetown lead to
7-2.

The Generals followed with
three touchdowns in the next
twenty minutes. All three tallies
came from sophomore tailback
Chris Cavalline, playing in his
first game in five weeks.

On the first score, junior
quarterback Rich Hachenburg
hit Cavalline with a 27-yard
touchdown pass. The run failed,
making the score 8-7, W&L.

Cavalline’s other touchdowns
came on runs of three and two
yards late in the second and
third quarters, respectively, as
the Generals rolled to a 23-7

TP isats 71 yard burst early in
the fourth quarter expanded the
W&L margin to 30-7, and sopho-
more tailback Ken Robinson’s
two-yard touchdown plunge
with 30 seconds left in the game

 

closed out the scoring.
