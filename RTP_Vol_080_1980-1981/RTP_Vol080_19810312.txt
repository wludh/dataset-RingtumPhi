Internship Allows Students Chance To Watch Criminal Process

by Steve Perry

Joel Segall is examining the
file of a woman charged with
arson and grand larceny. After
locating the needed informa-
tion, he moves on to another
“rap” sheet. Segall is not a
lawyer, he is a W&L student
who, along with three other
seniors, works for the Com-
monwealth’s Attorney.

Al Hintz, Rob Brooke, Mike
McFadden and Segall assist at-
torney John Read in a program
known as the ‘‘victim-witness
assistance program.” The pur-
pose of this program is to
prepare the victims and
witnesses of a crime for their

day in court through pre-trial
conferences, which strengthen
a case and relieve the victims’
anxiety about testifying.

The VWAP allows W&L
students the unique opportunity
to participate in a criminal case
from the initial hearing to the
final sentencing. Although the
students enjoy virtually all the
aspects of their job, they agree
that watching their work come
together in court is the most in-
teresting.

They participate in all areas
of this program, including pre-
trial conferences, plea-
bargaining, and backroom
discussions over strategy.

The students’ experience has
not been limited to the court
room. They have also visited
the Richmond Penitentiary in
hopes of understanding the en-
tire process of criminal law in
the state of Virginia.

Although misdemeanors are

the most commonly tried cases -

in Lexington courts, W&L
students have had the oppor-
tunity to work in many felonies
as well. These felony cases in-
clude the Carl White. murder
trial, earlier in the year.

The intership program was
organized by Dr. David Novack
of the sociology department
upon a request by Mr. Read. Dr.
Novack believes that the VWAP

is a natural extension of the
liberal arts education offered at
Washington and Lee. He added
that there are many pre-trial
benefits derived from a_ pro-
gram of this nature, including
the presentation of a paper bas-
ed on actual work experiences
at the end of each term. Al Hintz
has been selected to present his
paper to the Virginia Social
Sciences Foundation, and
Segall is presently under con-
sideration for a similar honor.
The course is worth three
credits and requires a
minimum of six hours work
each week, with additional time
spent in court. The course is
designed for those students

seeking independent study.
Hintz noted, ‘‘the internship has
given me the opportunity to
learn on my own.” He added,
‘it was instrumental in my ob-
taining an internship for this
-Summer.”’

Although a large commit-
ment is necessary, the students
are glad they participated.

Dr. Novack said that the pro-
gram is open to anyone who
wishes to participate and even
though the deadline for
registration for the spring term
has passed, interested students
may sign-up for the fall term
during pre-registration, or at
the beginning of the term next
year.

* ELECTIONS: *

Myers, Ross Winners;

IFC To Hold Run-Ott

Eric Myers and Bennett Ross
captured two of the EC’s big
three offices in Monday’s elec-
tion. The vice-presidential race
failed to produce a majority
winner, and a run-off was held
today.

Myers, who is currently one
of two junior representatives on
the EC, received 314 votes or 68
percent of the 461 ballots cast in
the EC presidential race.
Myers’ chief competition came
from John Vavala, a second-
year law student and write-in
candidate. Vavala received 120
votes for 26 percent of the total.

In the EC vice presidential
contest, Bud White, a junior,
and Jim Averett, a sophomore,
advanced to today’s run-off.
White won Monday’s election,
gathering 222 of the 541 votes.
Bud White’s share represented
only 40.8 percent of the total.
Averett finished second with 180
votes or 33.1 percent.

The race resulted in a plurali-
ty because a junior, Blake
Witherington, received slightly
more than 24 percent of the
votes. Only the top two finishers
advanced to today’s run-off.

In the campaign for EC
secretary, Bennett Ross out-
distanced his opponent, Dennis
Roberts. Ross finished with 354
of the 5619 votes for a majority
of 57.2 percent. Roberts
gathered 249 votes, leaving him
with 40.2 percent of the total.

The EC’s proposed constitu-
tional amendments once again
failed because a majority of the
student body did not vote. Only

36 percent of the student body
voted on the amendments, leav-
ing the EC approximately 240
Short of legitimizing the
changes.

The LFC
Results

On Monday afternoon, elec-
tions were held for the offices of
IFC president and _ vice-
president.

The current IFC president,
Monty Briscoe, stated, ‘‘the
voter turn-out was very poor.
Only 350 ballots were cast.”’

While the fraternities were
successful in electing a vice-
president, John McIntyre of Phi
Delta Theta, they were undecid-
ed over the choice of president.

Fire at Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity

Causes Estimated $12-15,000 Dama

by W. Cope Moyers

An agent from the arson divi-
sion of the Virginia State Police
began sifting through the rubble
Monday afternoon following a
weekend fire that heavily
damaged the Phi Kappa Psi
fraternity house. The _in-
vestigator immediately ruled
that the blaze, which occurred
during a party, was either in-
tentionally or accidentally
started by someone.

Although the investigation
will probably not be concluded
until later in the week, special
agent L.R. Thomas said the fire
was not caused by an electrical
short.

“It’s hard to tell now what ac-
tually happened, but it was not
electrical,” said Thomas.

The blaze, which occurred
about 1:00 a.m. Sunday morn-
ing, did extensive damage to
the third floor library and
storage room, and caused some
water damage in other areas of

estimated at between $12,000
and $15,000.

Thomas said that the damage .

would have been far more ex-
tensive had several fraternity
members not been. alerted by
smoke detectors. Two fraterni-
ty members heard the alarms

Ruby Dee: Monday Performance Is

Actress Ruby Dee

 

by Tori Richardson

Ms. Dee’s one woman perfor-
mance, ‘‘An Evening with Ruby
Dee,’’ was surely a treat for all
those in attendance at Lee
Chapel Monday. Her dramatic
and satirical interpretations of
poems and plays written by
such well-known black writers
as Langston Hughes, Nikki
Giovanni, and Gwendolyn
Brooks made the evening a
most pleasurable experience.
With her abundant feminine
charm, Ms. Dee also enthralled
the audience with several
original works.

A guest speaker presented by
the Student Association For
Black Unity, Ms. Dee’s works
centered around the Black
man’s experience in America,
and how this is reflected in his
writings and unique cultural
background. A_ native of
Harlem, New York, Ms. Dee
divulged to the audience some
experiences she encountered as
a young black woman struggl-
ing to survive in a theatrical
world not readily open to
Blacks. Only through her self-
awareness as a black was she
capable of accomplishing so

Ray Scherer, former NBC White House Correspondent

by John Wells

Various aspects of the
presidential news conference
were discussed at Washington
and Lee University last
weekend by a distinguished
group of panelists familiar with
news conferences from both
sides of the presidential
podium.

A series of three discussions
Friday and Saturday in Lee
Chapel titled ‘The Presidential
News Conference: Problems
and Promises,” produced in-
dividual recommendations and
featured insightful, articulate
and often highly entertaining
discussion by experienced pro-
fessionals.

Members of the panel were
Bill Moyers, press secretary
during the Johnson administra-
tion, who served as moderator;
Ron Nessen, press secretary to
President Gerald R. Ford; Ray
Scherer, former White House
correspondent for NBC; Frank
Cormier, Associated Press cor-
respondent at the White House;
Clark R. Mollenhoff, former
Washington Bureau chief for
the Des Moines Register and
Tribune; and Bill Plante, CBS
White House correspondent.
Ex-governor Linwood Holton of
Virginia was a special guest.
The only no-show was Sam
Donaldson of ABC News, who
remained in Washington for
President Reagan’s news con-
ference on Friday.

ferences, the panelists discuss-
ed various aspects of the event
and the study’s recommenda-
tions. ;
Scherer read an overview of a
study he co-chaired with Gov.
Holton at the White Burkette
Miller Center of the University
of Virginia last year. The
recommendations, many of
which have so far been incor-
porated by the president, are as
follows:

News conferences should be
held monthly, on a_ regular
basis.

These large functions should
be staggered with smaller, in-
formal meetings held weekly
with a few reporters and no TV
cameras.

Reporters should remain
seated, raising their hands to be
called on by the president.

Reporters should be selected
at random in the form of a lot-
tery.

Most of the panelists opposed
the lottery system idea. Cor-
mier said it makes the event
“‘stilted...cut and dried.”’
Nessen said the seated arrange-
ment detracts from the drama
and liveliness of previous occa-
sions.

Regarding the lottery system,
which produced numerous
questioners from small publica-
tions, Moyers asked if
‘‘parochial represenatives”’
should be allowed to par-
ticipate.

Cormier, a White House
veteran from 1962-1980, flatlv
opposed the idea. Too often, he
said, White House press passes
are issued to reporters with
‘dubious credentials.’ Plante,

who has covered the new ad-

ministration since the January

VBVVUVVUVYVGL,

)

inaugural, gave a qualified yes,
saying most interests are best
served by the largest publica-
tion. Scherer answered yes,
saying that in a democracy,
“everybody should be given a
chance.”’

The panelists concluded that
the press conference began its
decline following’ the
Eisenhower administration,
and suffered severely under
Presidents Nixon and Carter
with a brief respite under Presi-
dent Ford. Ronald Reagan
received scattered praise from
the group, Scherer finding it
“‘refreshing’’ that the president
can say “I don’t know’’ in
response to a question, and
Plante saying Reagan has got-
ten off to a good start with the

press corps.
In his opening remarks dur-

ing Friday night’s session,
Moyers said that there has been
disorder in the White House and
society in general since 1961.
Since then, said Moyers, we
have had, for various reasons,
five unsuccessful presidents.

Beginning in 1961, said
Moyers, press conferences
were transmitted live on nation-
wide TV. Discussing the impact
of television of the news con-
ference, Cormier complained
that the TV cameras have at-
tracted “attention seekers’’ in-
stead of reporters during the
last two decades.

Mollenhoff said that
presidents have ‘“‘used’’ the
televised press conferences to
their advantage from the begin-
ning.

‘Jack Kennedy was more in-
terested in promoting himself
than democracy,” he said.
Mollenhoff said the late presi-

reporters he knew would ask

about scandals in the defense
and agriculture departments.
Presidents Johnson and Nixon
engaged in the same practice,
according to Mollenhoff, whc
concluded that television has
contributed to the superficiality
of press conferences and the ig.
norance of news editors.
Scherer said that TV has pro-
vided a great benefit in taking
the event to the entire country.
Nessen said the TV cameras
create tension by simultaneous-
ly changing the nature of the
vent and providing the presi-
dent with the best means of
reaching millions of people.
Plante called the TV camera
“‘an unrelenting observer’ and
said it has changed the nature
of the relationship between the

Moyers listed the goals of the
news conference as laid out by
the panelists. He said the goals
are:

To allow the president to be
questioned regularly.

To keep the president well in-
formed.

To communicate the presi-
dent’s ideas to the bureaucracy.

To make news.

To propogandize.

To demonstrate how the

SAB’s Fancy Dress Expenses

by Bill Whalen

The SAB announced the costs
for the 1981 Fancy Dress week-
end totalled nearly $33,000. The
SAB also announced at an EC
meeting Monday that receipts
for FD amounted to almost
$27,500.

According to a report submit-
ted to the EC, the net loss for
this year’s Fancy Dress was
slightly less than $5,500. But
after the SAB spends an addi-
tional $1,100 to cover the cost of
playbills, the deficit should
amount to almost $6,500.

The EC was initially critical
of several facets of the ball, in-
cluding security and the handl-
ing of the coat room, but later
praised the SAB for its produc-
tion. The main concern of the
meeting was to determine ex-
actly why the deficit occurred.

“Ticket sales were down by
200 from last year,” said SAB
Co-Chairman Pryse Elam, who
noted that the SAB tried to
make the Fancy Dress produc-

Gov. Dalton Claims

by Cope Moyers

In a 40-minute pep talk aimed
at the Washington and Lee
Young Republicans, Virginia
Governor John Dalton said last
night that the future appears
bright for the Republican Party
in the Old Dominion.

Dalton told a small audience
in Lee Chapel that the G.O.P. is
“on the move,’’ particularly
because the party has, in his
words, one of the best organiza-
tions in the United States.

The governor said he cut his
teeth in politics in Virginia
when he was president and
chairman of the statewide
Young Republicans during the
1950’s. Dalton went on to say
that the status of the
Republican Party has radically
changed since he was a student
at William and Mary College.

tion ‘‘totally self-sufficient.”’

The SAB’s other co-
chairman, Jamie Small, was
quick to defend this year’s ball
and claimed that entertainment
was better than usual. ‘We
spent almost $21,000 for music
this year,’’ said Small, ‘‘and I
think that made the ball.”’

Elam also attributed some of
the high cost to music, stating
that in John Prine’s Thursday
night concert, W&L “got its
Spring concert early.”’ By hav-
ing Prine, Elam said the SAB
had put nearly $8,000 into
Thursday night alone.

Musical entertainment did
provide a majority of the SAB’s
expenses. In addition to Prine,
the Peter Duchin Orchestra
cost $7,000, Roomful of Blues
cost $2,000, Riders In The Sky
cost $1,200, Wedsel’s Edsels
cost $1,000 and the Original Dix-
ieland Strutters and Bill Clary
each cost $600.

The EC spent a portion of the
session discussing the various

“Virginia has moved from a
one-party state to a very viable
two-party state between the
time I was state chairman of
the Young Republicans and
now,’’ said the governor.

Dalton used _ Virginia’s
previous voting patterns as sup-
port for this claim, saying that
when he was 20 years old, the
state had never voted for a
Republican candidate for any
position. But except for
Virginia’s support of Lyndon
Johnson in 1964, Dalton said the
State has voted for the
Republican Presidential can-
didate for the past three
decades.

The governor echoed the sen-
timent of the National Gover-
nors’ Association when he told
the audience that now is the
time to reduce the role of the

strengths and weaknesses of
this year’s ball. Senior
Representative Marshall Clark
was critical of the way the coat
room was run, saying that its
management was “‘a farce.”’ ©
Both SAB co-chairmen said
that the decorations had been
vandalized, with Elam noting
that someone attempted to steal
both a poster in front of Carole
Chappel’s office and the direc-
tory it was placed inside.
Discussing attendance, Small
warned that it would not be
feasible to move Fancy Dress
into the Doremus Gymnasium
because of the lack of time and
the conflict with athletic teams.
Small mentioned that it takes
‘nearly two weeks to set up in the
University Center, and it would
be difficult to have the gym for
a comparable amount of time.
One reason for moving to the
gym is the amount of people the
ball attracts. Fire regulations
allow only 2,500 people in the

Dalton defended his ad-
ministration’s efforts during
the past three years, particular-
ly in the trimming of tax rates.

The governor said that during
his administration, electric,
telephone, real estate and in-
heritance taxes have been cut,
resulting in a $250 million
decrease in state tax revenues.

Dalton said he supports the
Reagan Administration’s
budget cuts but hopes that both
the Appalachain Regional and

nn ln. Notes

Midnight Cowboy (1969) John Schlesinger’s seedy film about
seedy characters in New York City. Well-made, trashy and rather
pointless, but compelling and pretty accurate. The star perfor-
mances help make it, with Jon Voight as a Texas boy turned hustler
and Dustin Hoffman as the slimy, disgusting Ratso. Not exactly a
family flick; it helped usher in the age of ‘‘gutsiness’’ to movies and
received the Academy Award for best picture despite its X-rating.

Well Paced ‘Ninth Step’,
Kind Words For Cast

 

by M. Shaw Pyle

‘Ninth Step,’ Take Two.

The following, our Lenten
Penance, is an adaptation of the
version of last weeks’ review of
Tom Zieglers’ The Ninth Step,
uninterupted by commercials.
Don’t touch that dial. )

The Ninth Step is the story of
a woman who is striving to
overcome her alcoholism. The
symptoms, the drinking, are
escapable, the underlying
causes are not. For years, she
has been tossed hither and yon
(not to mention yon and hither)
by the pressure of other folks’
expectations: the demands of
her mother, her church, her
husband. Never had_ she
developed the inner core that
alone can stabilize the soul. As a
result, she drinks. Like a fish.
This is not food for her mar-
riage or her life, both of which
promptly fall apart. Finally,
she turns to A.A. to rebuild her
life; a process based on A.A.’s
12-step program. It is on the
“Ninth Step’’ — the necessity to
make amends to the other vic-
tims of one’s alcoholism — that

the herione becomes stalled.
The reconciliation she must ef-
fect with the 18-year-old
daughter she left behind eight
years ago is the point of depar-
ture for Ziegler’s exploration of
the ramifications of life without
guts.

The only saving grace of the
W&L drama department is that
it’s fantastically competent.
The facilities are cramped, the
weather is on somebody else’s
side (every production gets
rained on), and the critic we
freely confess, is a grouch. But
they just keep rolling along.

The script is, in a word,
superb. But scripts don’t make
for tolerable evenings. Acting
does — and did. Despite opening
night dialogue misfires, there
wasn't a bad performance in
the lot. Ginger McNeese as
Joanna, the alcoholic herione,
was so impressive as to make
us forget who she is in front of
the footlights. She didn’t act the
lead. She was the lead. Pam
Simpson, as the yenta mentor,

Eleanor, was the sort of friend
even sover people need. Nancy
Stone turned in a work of art
—not craft — as Joanna’s
employee/victim Maria.

Rachelle Erwin, who has the
charming earnestness of a
Hollins style of Gilda Radner,
did a bang-up job as the wrong-
ed daughter, Melissa, and Cyn-
di Weeks left us frankly aghast
as the street child A.A. member
Tracy — aghast at the
character, which is just what
Ziegler was aiming for.

The light and sound system
—and the voice over, echoes
from Joanna’s past — were
highly effective. But it is not in-
novation or even showcase per-
formances that makes Ninth
Step such an important as well
as an interesting work. That
rests upon Ziegler’s ability to
point out that people with no
convictions can be quite as
dangerous as those with no
scruples. Think about it, little
ones.

Writer to Speak

Author Mignon Holland
Anderson will present a lecture
in Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s Lee Chapel at 8 p.m. on
Wednesday, March 18, as part
of the university’s Black Em-
phasis Month.

A 1966 graduate of Fisk
University where she received
a B.A. degree in English and
comparative literature, Ms.
Anderson received a graduate
degree from Columbia Univer-
sity in 1970.

Ms. Anderson has written
numerous articles and short
stories which have been
published in magazines and an-
thologies. In 1976, a collection of
her short stories was published
by the Third World Press of
Chicago. The volume is entitled

‘Mostly Womenfolk And A Man
Or Two.”’

Formerly editor of ‘Black
Communicator,’’ a_ tele-
communications journal based
in Washington, D.C., Ms.
Anderson is an advisory and
contributing editor to The New
Virginia Review, Inc., and was
selected by The Virginia Center
for the Creative Arts to be an
artist in residence during
August, 1980.

Ms. Anderson, her husband,
son and daughter live in Dum-
fries, Va., where she is current-
ly working on a novel.

Black Emphasis Month at
W&L is sponsored by the Stu-
dent Association for Black Uni-
ty. Ms. Anderson’s lecture is
open to the public.
 

If the Class of 1980 is any in-
dication, W&L graduates are
doing quite well in today’s
crowded job market and com-
petitive graduate and profes-
sional schools. Members of the
university’s most recent bac-
calaureate class are — for the
most part — doing what they
want to do, according to
Michael A. Cappeto, associate
dean of students and director of
career development and place-
ment.

Cappeto bases this belief on
the findings of the Placement
Office’s annual survey of recent
graduates. More than 83 per-
cent of the 1980 graduates
answered questions about their
graduate study or jobs as well
as their salary, career plans
and orientation. The survey,
which was not undertaken until
October 1980, allowed
graduates ample time to con-
duct a job search or begin
graduate study.

While some graduates _in-
dicated they were not admitted
to the law, medical, business, or
graduate school of their first
choice, they were nevertheless
accepted somewhere, in most
every case their second or third
choice. Likewise, most
graduates who began looking
for jobs found them and in-
dicated they are satisfied with
the work they are doing.

Almost one-third, 30.2 per-
cent, entered graduate and pro-
fessional school as full-time
students, slightly less than last
year’s 35.7 percent. But, accor-
ding to Cappeto, ‘‘these
Statistics should not be regard-
ed as a valid measure of the
percentage of W&L alumni who
pursue graduate education,
since there is a growing trend
for students to work a few years
prior to pursuing a graduate
program.”

For the fifth year in a row,
more undergraduates entered

law school than any other single
type of graduate study — 14 per-
cent in all, a figure that has re-
mained fairly constant over the
years. The University of
Virginia topped the list of law
schools with 1980 graduates in
the first year class (five),

‘followed by W&L’s law school

(four). All told, graduates are
enrolled in 23 different law
schools, ranging from Duke to
Georgetown to Oklahoma to
Rutgers.

The number of graduates
entering other graduate or pro-
fessional programs, business

school, medical school, or
graduate programs, is down
slightly from a year ago.

Nearly three percent entered
M.B.A. programs at nine
schools, including New York
University, Tulane, and the
University of Texas. Nine
medical schools, such as Louis-
iana State, Virginia, and
Vanderbilt, were represented
by 4.3 percent of the graduates.
And nearly nine percent of the
Class of 1980 entered graduate
school programs other than
law, business, or medicine.
Graduates reported entering 18
graduate schools, including
Cornell, Dallas Theological
Seminary, the Pratt Institute,
and Texas A&M, to earn
degrees in nearly 20 different
fields, such as_ geophysics,
mechanical engineering,
psychology, interior design, and
architecture. Cappeto noted the
decline in recent years of
graduates entering humanities-
related graduate programs.

The second half of Cappeto’s
report deals with graduates
who went to work immediately
after graduation. Nearly 60 per-
cent of the graduating class ob-
tained jobs after graduation.
This figure is slightly higher
than the five year average, 57.4
percent. The business profes-
sions, education, and the
military were the most popular
careers.

 

The report distinguished be-
tween a job and a career — a
career being the type of work
composed of one or more
related jobs. The report noted
that ‘‘statistics show that dur-
ing his working life, the typical
college graduate will have three
different careers composed of
twelve different jobs. Also, to-
day’s college graduate is ex-
pected to keep his first job for
about two years. Therefore, it is
important to keep in mind that
the results of this study show
the types of jobs and (maybe)
the first careers entered by the
recent graduates. Results are
not predictions of future
careers of the Class of 1980.”

Slightly more than half of the
graduates who did not enter
graduate or professional school
received job offers on or before
graduation day. About 10 per-
cent received jobs in each of the
five months following gradua-
tion so that by late October
(when the survey was made)
only 7.6 percent of the class re-
mained unemployed. All but six
unemployed graduates _in-
dicated they had just recently
started their job search or were
not seeking work. Cappeto con-
cluded that ‘unemployment af-
fects only an_ insignificant
number of recent W&L
graduates.”

In terms of employment
quality or underemployment
(the underutilization of skills,
education and human resources
which is a serious problem in
labor markets today ) graduates
again fared well. Although 15.7
percent of job holders believed.
they were underemployed, only
8.7 percent saw no future in
what they were doing.

To measure the job satisfac-
tion of recent graduates, ques-
tions were asked about job
challenge, long range career
goals, salary, geographic loca-
tion, and type of work. In
general, the Class of 1980 seem-
ed satisfied with its jobs.

percent) said they were
satisfied with their salary and
even more (85.6 percent) with

Wittig To Lecture On
College Curriculum

Susan Wittig, dean of Tulane
University’s Sophie Newcomb
College, will speak at
Washington and Lee University
on “Community and Consen-
sus: The Structure of a College
Curriculum,”’ on Monday,
March 16, at 8 p.m. in Room 327
of McCormick Hall. Wittig’s
visit is sponsored by the Univer-
sity’s Ad Hoc Committee on
Liberal Education. The public
is invited to attend.

Wittig received her B.A. from
the University of Illinois and
her master’s and doctorate
degrees in English from the
University of California at
Berkeley. She taught at the
University of San Francisco
and the University of Texas
before becoming associate dean
of the Graduate School at Texas
in 1977. She has been associate
professor of English and dean of
Sophie Newcomb (the women’s
division of Tulane University)
since 1979. Her research has
been supported by such
organizations as the Danforth
Foundation, the Alfred B. Sloan
Foundation, and the National
Science Foundation.

An acknowledged expert in
the field of general college
education requirements, Wittig
is the author of more than 20
scholarly books or articles, in-
cluding “‘A Theory of Multiple
Meanings,” ‘‘Stylistic and Nar-
rative Structures in the Middle
English Verse Romances,’’ and
“The Computer and the Con-

cept of Text.”
The Ad Hoc Committee on
Liberal Education was

established last year at the re-
quest of Washington and Lee
President Robert E.R. Huntley
to study problems associated
with and offer suggestions for
strengthening liberal arts
education at Washington and
Lee. The committee will host a
reception following Wittig’s
talk.

ROTC

Awards

(continued from page 3)

In order to achieve their new
status, each of the students had
to accomplish a number ot
tasks, including competence in
land navigation and compass
reading, technical knowledge of

the M-16 rifle and military
radios, and a rigorous survival
Swimming course, most of
which was conducted in full
military equipment. Finally,
they had to pass an extremely

demanding physical fitness test
which required them to perform
six chin ups in one minute, 55
push ups and sit ups in under
two minutes per event, and last

to run a timed two miles in
military boots, carrying a rifle.
Good conditioning was obvious-
ly a significant factor in their —
selection as cadet Rangers.

Note: This is the fifth and final in-
terview in’ a series by Sports
Editor Ralph Frasca

Ah, we've come to the last in-
terview of the series. Not by ac-
cident, I've saved the top man
for last. When one speaks of
Washington and Lee faculty
members who have played or
nearly played professional
sports, Athletic Director Bill
McHenry must certainly be in-
cluded.

An alumnus of good ol’ W&L,
McHenry was a standout foot-
ball and lacrosse player for the
Generals. Playing center and
linebacker (they played two-
way in those days), he was the
last gridiron standout of the era
in which W&L was a major col-
lege football team.

The captain of the 1953 team,
he was voted the outstanding
athlete at W&L in his senior

 

Bill McHenry as he looked in his playing days.

 

Hoy Named Assistant
Basketball Coach

by Rick Swagler

Carby Hoy has been named to
the position of Assistant Basket-
ball Coach, effective next fall.
The announcement was made
by Head Coach Verne Canfield.

In a decision made last year,
Canfield created the position
especially for Hoy, who will
primarily help assistant coach
Howard Ainsley with the junior
varsity responsibilities,
scouting and recruiting. Hoy
will not be a full-time assistant,
next year and hopes to continue
his schooling.

When Canfield was asked
about Hoy’s involvement in
what has come to be known as
the “Boxwood Incident,’’ in

which a number of students,
mostly basketball players,
damaged 37 English boxwood
bushes on campus, he replied,
‘‘What the hell does that have to
do with his coaching and
teaching ability? That’s all
history. He’s paid his dues.”
Canfield noted that Hoy finished
his career with 920 points, and
had he not been suspended last
season, most likely would have
joined Rob Smitherman in scor-
ing over 1000 career points. On-
ly six players have accomplish-
ed this feat under Canfield.

Canfield commented, ‘‘Carby
has tremendous potential and
I’m pleased to offer him the
job.”

The Playing Days

of Bill Mc Henry

year. Other honors included
selection to the Blue-Grey
squad, as well as the College
All-Star team, which faced the
National Football league defen-
ding champion Detroit Lions.

Unfortunately, a shocking
cheating scandal which rocked
the foundations of W&L oc-
curred several days before the
class of 1954, Mc Henry’s class,
was to graduate. A number of
students were involved, most of
which were football players.

“Someone got the key to a
room where the final exams
were run off, and made more
copies of the tests. These were
distributed to all those involv-
ed,’ McHenry reports. ‘‘I didn’t
know anything about it.””

Because most of the guilty
football players held athletic
scholarships, the administra-
tion effected a drastic change in
the sports program.

“There were no divisional
classifications like there are
now. Back then, schools either
had major-college or small-
college athletic status. The ma-
jor colleges were permitted to
grant athletic scholarships, the
small colleges were not,”’
McHenry stated.

Due to the financial drain of
major-college status, W&L had
given consideration to swit-
ching over, but the embarrass-
ment caused by the scandal
forced the school to opt for
small-college status. Athletic
scholarships were’ thus
eliminated, although scholar-
ships held by W&L students at
that time were honored.

Regarded as one of the top
college football players in the
nation at that time, McHenry
was contacted by every one of
the NFL teams. He was even-
tually drafted in the sixth round
by the Washington Redskins.

“The Redskins’ owner,
George Marshall, showed a lot
of interest in me, and I an-
ticipated being drafted by
Washington. However, when it
came time to discuss my con-
tract, Marshall offered me only
$5,500 plus a $500 signing bonus.
That was a small amount of
money even in those days!"’

McHenry was then contacted
by the Hamilton Tiger Cats of
the Canadian Football League.

“The NFL had no American
competition in the 1950's,”
recalled McHenry. ‘‘Thus the
CFL engaged in ‘player piracy,’
offering better contracts to
athletes who were disgruntled
with the meager NFL wages.”’

However, two days before he
was to report to the Tiger Cats’
training camp, he was drafted
into the United States Army.

“It was at the tail end of the
Korean War, and I was all
ready to report for football
when I received my draft
notice. I asked the Army for a
deferrment so that I could play

~ coaching position,
Huntley asked McHenry to take’

football in 1954, but they denied
my request. As it worked out, I
wasn’t given my orders until
the following January. I lost a
year of football while waiting
tor my orders.”’

McHenry was discharged in
August of 1956, whereupon he
was again offered a contract
with the Tiger Cats, but he
chose to enter coaching. With a
wife, and a child on the way, he
was looking for security. Thus,
he accepted a coaching position
at Widener College. In 1958, he
took the job of head lacrosse
coach at Williams College.
Three years later, he became
the Athletic Director at
Lebanon Valley College, a post
he held until 1971.

Former W&L Athletic Direc-
tor Gene Corrigan, who current-
ly holds the same position at
Notre Dame, accepted the A.D.
post at Virginia in 1971. With the
job vacant, alumnus McHenry
was contacted.

“I was very excited about
returning to my alma mater,”’
he said.

When Buck Leslie stepped
down from the football head
President

over. He led the team for five
years, until he hand-picked
Gary Fallon as successor.

McHenry’s coaching days are
not over, though. He is beginn-
ing his second year at the helm
of the JV lacrosse team.

“I like to keep my hand in
coaching and maintain contact
with the students,”’ he noted.

The JV squad will primarily

play varsity opponents. They

open against the Notre Dame
varsity.

Rumors have been . cir-
culating about the prospect of
McHenry accepting the post of
Athletic Director at the Univer-
sity of Maryland.

‘“T have been contacted by
Maryland, but rumors that I
have been definitely offered the
job are premature. I’m not sure
that I would accept it even if it
was offered.”

The tall, ruggedly handsome
McHenry has served on the
NCAA Rules Committees for
both football and lacrosse, was
past President of both the
United States Intercollegiate
Lacrosse Association. and the
United States Lacrosse Coaches
Association, is currently Presi-
dent of the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference, Vice
President of the Virginia Sports
Hall of Fame, sits on the Board
of Directors of the Lacrosse
Foundation and Hall of Fame,
and presides over the W&L
Fellowship of Christian
Athletes, as well as many other
accomplishments.

It seems that the only direc-
tion for ex-college football star
Bill McHenry has been up-
wards. His achievements give
testament to his propensity for
success.

series of interviews, and I wish
to thank Coaches Fallon, Em-
mer, Williams, Lyles, and
McHenry for their cooperation.

Lacrosse Team Wins

Both Exhibition Games

by Robert Massie

The Washington and Lee
University lacrosse team com-
pleted an undefeated exhibition
season last weekend with vic-
tories over the Mt. Washington
and Chesapeake lacrosse clubs.

W&L defeated. Mt. Washing-
ton for the first time ever, by a
score of 12-11. The game was
close throughout, with the
largest lead of the game belong-
ing to Mt. Washington, 11-7, ear-
ly in the third quarter.
However, the Generals rallied
for five consecutive goals and
held off Mt. Washington for the
win.

Bob Clements, W&L alumnus,
went all the way for Mt.

Washington in the goal, and

- Ware Palmer performed well in

his first tough game as the
Generals’ goalie.

Other standouts for W&L in-
cluded George Santos, Geoff
Brent and Rob Carpenter.

Sunday’s game against
Chesapeake turned out to be a
little easier, with the Generals
emerging victorious, 15-12. The
game was close during the first
half, but sharp passing and suc-
cessful outside shooting by the
Generals opened up a 3-goal
lead.

W&L opens its regular season
this weekend at home against
New Hampshire. Game time is
2:00, March 15 at Wilson Field.

Golfers Open Season

Led by coach Buck Leslie, the
W&L golf outlook appears quite
promising this spring, and
coach Leslie hopes to match, if
not improve, an impressive 13-3
record of a year ago.

Although it is too early in the
season to tell, the team line-up
seems very strong, namely with
junior Jim Kaplan, senior co-
captain Gerry Barousse, and
junior co-captain Bill Alfano
leading the squad. Several

   

other members appear equally
promising, including senior
Steve Everett, juniors Del
Agnew and Tim _ Good,
sophomores Jerry Moyer and
Tom Wohlfarth, and freshman
Bruce Blythe. Coach Leslie em-
phasizes compatability, and
states that team balance is key
to a successful season.

The golfers face University of
Rochester on Friday. The
match will be held at the Lex-
ington Country Club.

for his squad.

“I thought we could win the
ODAC,”’ asserted Canfield. ‘I
assumed that by tourney time
we would get it together. We
had a strong nucleus of veteran
players and, although I knew
Roanoke was favored to win, I
thought we could beat them
—and we did. I guess that’s why
the rest of the season was so
disappointing.”

For the Generals, their 96-79
rout of the Maroons on January
20th proved to be the high-water
mark for W&L basketball this
season.

Beating the then fourth-
ranked Roanoke team
catapulted W&L to 16th place in
the NCAA Division III polls a
week later. The Generals stood
at 12-3 overall, and their 4-1
ODAC mark had pulled them in-
to a tie with Roanoke for the
ODAC lead.

Then, in the same manner
that they had flashed in the top-
twenty nationally, the W&L
hoopsters suddenly soured.

Even Canfield cannot pin
down the exact reason why the
Generals went 4-7 in the second
part of the season, nor why they
lost in the first round of the
ODAC Tournament. Canfield
can only offer factors that he
feels added up to his team’s
* downfall.

Track

by John Harrison
It appears that the W&L track
and field team will have little
difficulty in matching last
year’s 12-5 record.

A good balance in experience
in almost every event should be
the Generals’ strongest asset
when they begin the new season
this Saturday against Davidson.
The meet will get under way at
11 a.m. Senior co-captains R.J.
Scaggs and Billy Morris head
the list of sixteen returnees,
with sixteen freshmen and
other newcomers completing
coach Norris Aldridge’s roster.

“In the first part of the
season, our concentration was
good and our attitude was
super,’’ stressed the coach.
“‘We wanted to beat people.”’

In that same month of
January, the Generals had
defeated a tough Saint Andrews
team, 79-72. Saint Andrews
subsequently made it to the
NCAA Division III Tournament.
How could a team good enough
to beat S-A then begin losing to
ODAC rivals such as Lynchburg
and Hampden-Sydeny?

Canfield offered that, in the
second half of the season, ‘‘we
began playing not-to-lose, in-
stead of playing to win. Also,
key players began to relax their
mental toughness and became
more individualistic.”’

Only a team effort, maintain-
ed Canfield, spearheaded by an
aggressive defense, will win
games for W&L. Yet, as the
coach stated, ‘“‘we began to
score less from our defense in
the latter part of the season. We
began to play defense just to
stop the other team, and not to
keep them from going into their
offense. As a result, our offense
became less effective.’’

In addition, the loss of senior
co-captain R.J. Scaggs to a
wrist injury in mid-January
created problems that became
more apparent as the season

_ progressed. Scaggs, a talented

senior from Roanoke, Virginia,
opened the season as a starting
forward for the Generals and
averaged ten points in the thir-

Aldridge has an optimistic
outlook, based on the strong
performances given by several
individuals of the winter track

_ team. “Overall, I was really

pleased with the results. We
were inexperienced in a few
events, as we will be this spring,
but that should not keep us from
being a solid team.” He also
believes that in addition to be-
ing capable of equalling last
season’s mark, his _ present
team should do as well, if not
better, in the ODAC as did last
year’s team. In fact, two of the
returnees are conference cham-
pions: Scaggs (400 meter) and

Canfield Reflects On Season

teen games he played.

Yet Scaggs’ loss was not so
much a blow scoring-wise as it
was a loss in_ leadership.
‘Scaggs had the ability to get a
timely basket or cause a turn-
over when the team really need-
ed a break,” noted Canfield.
‘Also, he was one of the top
defensive players I’ve coached
in my 17 years with W&L.”’

With the season over, Can-
field is undertaking a complete
shakedown of his entire basket-
ball program — keeping the
positive things, and throwing
out the things which, in his
estimation, don’t work.

“I’m not just going to look at
the offense and defense,”’ com-
mented Canfield. ‘‘I’m also ex-
amining our recruiting pro-
cedures and other aspects of the
program. I think this change
will be a healthy and positive
thing, and there will be
noticeable changes made.”’

Among his top priorities, Can-
field is looking to establish: ‘‘re-
clarification of roles’’ to stress
the team-play aspect; more
defensive changes (more
presses, etc.) to avoid becom-
ing “‘stagnant”’ defensively; a
continuity-oriented offense that
can be played without a big
man.

To implement these changes,
Canfield’s philosophy for next
year is simple: ‘‘I’m going to be
firm in my demands early on,
and get tougher as the season
progresses ~— maybe even
downright mean.”

Team Previewed

Mike Fogarty (javelin).
Aldridge says that he does not
know much about Davidson.
“‘Last year’s meet was cancell-
ed by snow. We beat them two
years ago down there, 74-71. I do

know that they have some good
hurdlers and field event men,
but I have not heard anything
about their sprinters. It should

be interesting, since our
previous meets with them have
always been fairly close.”’

He adds that the team worked
hard during the winter to get
prepared and is looking forward
to getting the season started.

Top Athletes Wind Up Their W&L Careers

by Ralph Frasca

and Rick Swagler

In only a few short months, a
number of Washington and
Lee’s top athletes will graduate,
thus ending their collectively
outstanding college athletic
careers.

Many seniors participated in
most of W&L’s intercollegiate
sports, and all deserve con-
gratulations for their dedication
and effort. However, a handful
of athletes merit particular at-
tention for their leadership,
dedication, and excellence of
play.

Coach Gary Fallon will lose
six seniors from his football
squad. Notable among them is
running back Chris Leiser, who
led the team in rushing with 555
yards. “I probably won’t fully
realize that my playing days at
W&L are over until next year,”
said Leiser. ‘‘When the guys
start practicing next fall, I'll
feel as though I’m supposed to
be with them, but I’ll realize
that I can’t anymore.”’

Leiser, who is currently play- -

ing on the Rugby team has
given serious thought to contin-
uing his football career in the
Canadian Football League, but
his future plans call for him
to attend the University of
Florida for two years to earn a
degree in architecture.

Fallon offered glowing praise
for his all-purpose back.

“Chris was a fine punt and
kickoff returner, as well as an
exemplary running back. He
really wasn’t big enough (5’6’’)
to play college football, but he
overcame the odds.”’

In the words of coach Rolf
Piranian, W&L soccer “has
turned the corner.” Instrumen-
tal in this feat were seniors
Bryan Williams and Kevin
Carney. Carney has played
W&L soccer through what Pira-
nian calls ‘the lean years’’ to
see the team progress from a
3-10 season in his freshman year
to a 9-4 mark this year. Carney
holds the school records for

career saves and career
shutouts.

Williams, who transferred
from Denison University follow-
ing his freshman year, has been
named team MVP for all of his
three years here. Other ac-
colades include the All-South
squad, and playing in the
Virginia All-Star Game. A knee
injury, according to Piranian,
“really slowed him, especially
psychologically, but a Bryan
Williams with an injured knee is
as good as any other player on
the team.”

ee r

Williams has been invited toa
professional soccer tryout with
the Charlotte Lightnin’ and is
considering a _ professional
career.

When Howard Herndon, who
shared the responsibilities of
crosscountry captain with
Charlie Warner this fall, arriv-
ed on the W&L campus four
years ago, he had never run
competitive cross-country or
track. His early goal had been
to just ‘“‘hang in there during the
workouts.’’ Instead of merely
accomplishing his initial goals,
Herndon continually raised his

i

Lan SEMGULL

goals, thus motivating himself
to give extra effort.

Herndon feels that W&L’s
athletic program allows
students ‘‘to enjoy sports’’ and
the accompanying ‘‘team
togetherness’’ without the
pressure of a _ scholarship-
oriented program. Herndon
typifies the scholar-athlete im-
age, having been selected for
Phi Beta Kappa honors, as well
as being chosen the cross-
country co-captain.

The team which may ex-
perience the greatest loss to

   

is final season.
graduation is the basketball
team. Three of the tive
Generals’ starters (Carby Hoy,
Rob Smitherman, and R.J.
Scaggs) have played their last
games at W&L.

One of Rob Smitherman’s
primary reasons for attending
W&L was the opportunity to
play basketball.

“T’m glad W&L doesn’t offer
athletic scholarships, because I
wouldn’t have been able to play
much if I were competing for a
spot on the team with ‘paid’
recruits. The current system of-
fers students the chance to play

who ordinarily wouldn’t at a
scholarship school.”’

Smitherman doubts that he’ll
play organized basketball
again. Instead, he plans to

enter law school or teach high
school history.

Hoy, who has long wanted
to coach basketball on the col-
legiate level, was named to the
post of assistant basketball
coach (see related article)
Tuesday.

In reflecting on his years with
the basketball program, Hoy
will miss the camaraderie
which existed between players,
but notes that the team suffered
from a “lack of student body
support.”

Wrestling co-captain Dave
Stoeffel, a three year letter-
man, has proven that absence
does make the heart grow
fonder. As a junior, Stoeffel suf-
fered an injury which prevented
him from wrestling, but he
stayed close to the program and
was elected co-captain in his
senior year.

Coach Gary Franke _at-
tributes Stoeffel’s success to
“this willingness to work.”
Franke called Stoeffel an ex-
cellent example of ‘‘a good
leader” and a student ‘‘who
kept athletics and academics in
perspective.”

An interesting note about
Stoeffel is that until his
sophomore season at W&L, in
which the team finished with a
6-4 record, he had never wrestl-
ed for a winning team.

Stoeffel is a leader by exam-
ple who will surely be missed by
the grapplers next year.

Among the seniors which
W&L’s lacrosse team will lose
this year is George Santos. San-
tos stated that his first priority
is to help accomplish the team’s
goal of an NCAA playoff berth.
Secondly, he aspires to become
an All-American, and his third
goal is to “help the younger
players develop.”’

Santos believes that his
leadership role ‘thas become

more significant” but that the
‘leadership is spread out
amongst the other seniors.’’

The senior thinks that the
question of whether or not W&L
should offer athletic scholar-
ships is difficult and can see the
pros and cons. However, a com-
mon view held by W&L athletes
is that the lack of scholarships
motivates the players to beat
teams with scholarship players.

Santos is happy that more
emphasis has been placed on
conditioning, and states that the
team should be able to ‘‘out-
hustle’’ most of the opposition.

After graduation, Santos
plans to seek work experience
before enrolling in a Master of
Business Administration pro-
gram.

Tom Coates is the only senior
on a young baseball squad. With
14 new players on a 24 man
squad, Coates will be called
upon heavily to provide leader-
ship from his post as co-captain.

“TI really believe we can be
winners this season. We haven’t
had one in ten years.”’

Coates had an added incen-
tive for wanting to play with a
winner. His brother played with
the last winning baseball team,
and Tom wants to keep the
‘‘tradition’’ in the family.

The catcher has set numerous
personal goals for himself, in-
cluding a mid-.300’s_ batting
average, and a fielding percen-
tage of .980.

An accounting-business ad-
ministration major, Coates
plans to attend the University of
Baltimore Law School.

Golfers Jerry Barousse and
Steve Everett enter their final

season this spring.
Barousse has won All-
American and _  AIl-ODAC

honors, as well as many other
laurels under Buck Leslie’s
tutelage, and Everett has been
a dependable four-year per-
former.

Finally, the tennis team will
lose one of its most proficient
performers in recent years
when Pete Lovell graduates.
Lovell is expected to lead the
Generals to another fine season
under Coach Gary Franke.

Senior student-athletes such
as Leiser, Williams, Smither-
man, Coates, and others have
proved themselves as team
leaders and dedicated athletes.
The Washington and Lee com-
munity in general and the
athletic program in particulr
will miss the contributions of
these fine individuals.

Baseball Team Tops Robert Morris In Scrimmage

by Todd Barstow

While major league baseball
was revived in various Florida
and Arizona spring training
sites, wind-swept Lexington
was also the scene of diamond
action, as the Washington and
Lee Generals scrimmaged
Robert Morris Business College
Tuesday. The Generals took ad-
vantage of sloppy defensive
play by Robert Morris en route
to an 8-5 victory.

W&L drew first blood, scoring
four runs in the second inning.
Mark McLaughlin led off with a
walk. On a hit-and-run play,
Jeff Haggerty singled to center,
where the ball was bobbled.
McLaughlin steamed for home,
arriving safely. First baseman
Mike Walsh then singled, scor-
ing Haggerty. Walsh stole se-
cond, and moved to third on a
wild pitch. Don Dudley walked,
and another wild pitch sent
Dudley to second and Walsh
home. Catcher Tripp Brower
grounded out to short, but

Dudley alertly took third, scor-
ing on pitcher Rich Hachen-
burg’s sacrifice fly.

R-M came back in the fourth
with three tallies, the biggest
blow a two-run homer off
reliever Jim Halprin. A pair of
singles, a walk, and an infreld
out completed the run produc-
tion. With hurler Jim
Brockelman, who replaced

EC

(continued from page 3)
almost 3,000 people attended the
ball.

Small went on to add that
‘nearly 60 percent of the ad-
ministration attended the ball.”’
Junior Representative Tripp
Brower questioned whether
members of the administration
should be allowed to attend the
ball free of charge, but was told
by Small that ‘‘if you changed
the rule, I don’t think they'd
show up.”’

Before the SAB’s report, the
SEC heard a request from the
Students Association for Black
Unity. S.A.B.U. spokesman Ray
Magee asked the EC for $1,200
to help his group’s ball remain

free of charge. After considera-
tion, the EC agreed to give
S.A.B.U. only $750.

The EC agreed to give
S.A.B.U. the money out of its
funding account, which totals
$900. The EC decided not to
touch its reserve fund which has
a total, according to EC Vice
President Willie Mackie, of
more than $4,000.

Magee said that the band for
the ball will cost almost $1,500
and $850 would be needed from
the EC to partially pay for the
band. The rest of the $1,200
would be used, according to
Magee, for decorations.
Without the $1,200 total, he said
S.A.B.U. will likely be forced to
charge admission to the ball.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

A Coming Together?

The subject of law school and undergraduate rela-
tions will likely become a major topic of discussion by
student leaders until the law school commencement
on May 24. While the relationship between the admit-
tedly separate student bodies has been evident for

some time, no one has really approached the situation.

in terms of dealing with a problem. It seems now that
the Executive Committee is going to discuss the rela-
tionship with the Student Bar Association as though it
is a problem. The EC’s main goal, articulated by
president Bob Willis, is reuniting the two schools into
one entity. We wonder if both the law school and the
undergraduate school should, or even want to be
molded into one entity.

One strong tie between the two schools is the group
of law students who were graduated from Washington
and Lee. Year in and year out this group produces
strong representatives such as former student body
president Beau Dudley and EC representative Jeff
Edwards. These two leaders have played a significant
role on the undergraduate campus as well as in Lewis
Hall. Law students are also active in the intramural
program and participate in major events such as the
Mock Convention and Contact. Yet even though there
are other ties between the schools, it seems there also
exist some formidable barriers which seperate the
two campuses. .

The most noticeable obstacle separating the schools
is the physical barrier. Few students wander across
the footbridge to Lewis Hall and seldom do many law
students make it over to the undergraduate campus.
The gap or division connected by the footbridge is
deeper and wider than it appears. There is also an age
difference which separates undergraduates and law
students. Inherent to the age difference are distinctly
different interests. Law students are generally more
mature, older and much more serious about their
studies. Another difference is scheduling. Law
students are deprived of full access to certain ser-
vices when undergraduates go on break.

A comprehensive list of similarities and differences
should be drawn up and studied. If the Executive
Committee is truly interested in the situation, it
should investigate it closely. We think closer ties be-
tween the schools could benefit both groups, but we
also think it absurd to try reconciliaton and strive for
unity if neither group is firmly committed to improv-
ing ties. In short, one can not legislate attitude; if the
law school and undergraduate campuses do not want
to function as one entity, efforts in that direction will
probably be futile. We urge the Executive Committee
to test the current before hopping in and being taken

for a ride.
The Vote

It’s funny the way things you discard or throw away
can boomerang back and hit you in the face. Many
students threw away their votes this week — in both
the Executive Committee and Interfraternity Council
elections — and the same students will likely be the
first people to gripe next year when the EC or IFC
makes a decision that the non-voter does not like. The
fact that only a third of the student body turned out for
elections is disturbing, but we will have a chance to
vote this spring. Each election does make a difference
whether you come in contact with our student govern-
ment or not.

 

Some Law Students Opposed To
Unification Of Undergrad, LawSchools

Dear Editor:

We at the law school have
observed with interest the
growing concern that there is a
lack of unity between the
undergraduates and the law
students. Bob Willis noted in the
Phi last week that the E.C. was
“trying to find ways to unite the
campus” and that unadvertised
law school parties were not
helping in that effort.

We do not attempt to speak
for all law students, but many of
us have no desire to unify the
two schools. There are very real
differences between the

  
   
    

/~ cA \
fara be
_ 5 tae

undergraduates and the law
students which preclude any
harmonious unification. These
differences include divergent
work and_ study habits,
dissimilar social interests, and
a law school student body
which, realistically, includes
women.

We respect the rights of the
undergraduate students to have
their traditions as incidents of
their undergraduate education.
The law students, however,
come from a wide variety of
backgrounds and colleges, and
many of us have been out of

school for several years. We
have already experienced those
types of traditions and have no
desire to relive them.

To address the issue of
unadvertised law school par-
ties, we fail to see how they
could be of paramount impor-
tance to anyone but law
students. If the E.C. and the
Trustees are really concerned
about unity of the two schools,
why not see that the law
students have equal access to
all the facilities of the universi-
ty. Law students pay the same
tuition as undergraduates, and
we should have the same oppor-
tunities to use the gym, the din-
ing hall, and the infirmary.
The hours for these facilities
are drastically cut during
undergraduate vacations, but
they are not affected at all by
law school vacations. Thus, law
students are deprived of equal
access.

In sum, the two schools
should not be forced into an un-
natural unity, but should in-
stead be allowed a separate and
equal co-existence. Again, we
stress that the views expressed
are those of the undersigned
alone.

firemen arrived. Mattresses,
file cabinets and student’s per-
sonal belongings were stored in
the room.

One of the students who heard
the alarm and discovered the
fire, Dave Stevens, is a
volunteer fireman with the Lex-
ington Fire Department.
Stevens said that despite
repeated efforts by several peo-
ple to put out the fire with ex-
tinguishers, three boxsprings
and some boxes were already
on fire and flames were
spreading up the wall.

“We decided that it was too
much for us to handle,’ Stevens
said. “I told Gentner (Tom) to
get everyone out and I went to
the station.”’

About. 40 people were in the
house when the fire started but
had no trouble exiting. Firemen
did, however, have difficulty
getting the trucks close to the
back of the house. Cars lined the
driveway and parking lot, said
Lexington Fire Chief Bryan
Causey.

Causey said one fire truck
scraped against a car when the
truck was turning into the

“the blaze before

driveway. There was minor
damage to both vehicles, accor-
ding to Causey.

Stevens said that when he
returned with his equipment
and climbed to the third floor
with a hose, the fire was so hot
that it exploded flashlight bat-
teries in his back pocket.
Causey estimated that the fire
reached temperatures between
2,000 and 3,000 degrees
Fahrenheit, after it spread on
the ceiling and out a window.

Firemen were able to contain
it burned
through the roof. Causey said

that had the fire reached the
roof, it would have been more
difficult to control and damage
would have been more exten-
Sive.

“If it hadn’t been for those
smoke detectors, we would pro-
bably still be here,’ Causey
said. ‘“‘Everyone ought to have
them.”’

Members of Phi Psi were not
only shocked by Sunday morn-
ing’s fire, but were also
dismayed that the fire started
in a room rarely used by
anyone. Although almost
anyone can go to the third floor

library, especially on weekend
nights, president Tony Ierardi
said practically no one even ©
goes into the storeroom where
the fire started.

‘We hardly ever let anybody
who isn’t in the house up there,
and very rarely are there peo-
ple in that room,” said Ierardi.

‘“‘Not many of us have really
comprehended it (the fire) yet
and as a result, there are a lot of
stories about how it happened
going around,”’ he added.

The fraternity agreed Mon-
day night to give $50 to the fire
department for their efforts.
