Eleven Proposals Approved

In Three-hour Session

by Cope Moyers

Several sweeping proposals
to amend the student body con-
‘Stitution were approved by the
Executive Committee Monday
night and will be voted on by the
student body next week.

Among the eleven proposals
approved by the committee is
an amendment that would
change the number of votes
needed by a candidate in order
to be elected to office. Under the
proposed amendment, which is
aimed at eliminating some run-
off elections, any candidate
running for one position would
need a simple majority of votes
in order to be elected.

The constitution now requires
that the two candidates receiv-
ing the most votes be in a run-
off the Thursday after the elec-
tion. The candidate then receiv-
ing the most votes is the winner.

“This amendment is a com-
promise between what we have
now and abolishing run-offs
completely,’’ said EC member
Jeff Edwards.

Edwards, who co-authored
the ten proposed amendments
with EC member Marshall
Clark, said the present system
does not work effectively
because it permits a candidate
who did not receive a plurality
in the first election to still win

the position by winning the run-
off.

“It’s not fair to tell someone
they don’t win when they get the
most votes,’’ Edwards said.

The proposal also allows for
run-offs when two positions are
at stake. The candidate with the
most votes automatically wins
one of the two positions while

the next two candidates with the:
most votes are in the Thursday
run-off.

A similar rule would apply
when three positions are con-
tested. The two candidates with
the most votes would be
declared winners and the next
two candidates with the most
votes would face each other in
the run-off election. The winner
would gain the third position.

The committee also approved
a proposed amendment
designating the sixth Monday of
the fall term as election day for
first-year law students. The
proposal would permit the law
school to elect its second
member to the Executive Com-
mittee earlier than in past
years, giving them better
representation on the commit-
tee. The freshman position on
the EC would be filled the sixth
week after undergraduate
classes begin.

Another proposed amend-

W&L Employee Arrested

By John R. Smith

A Washington and Lee
employee was arrested by Lex-
ington police Monday on
charges including six counts of
breaking and entering and one
count of grand larceny.

Charles Russell Smith of Rt.
1, Lexington, has been charged
with breaking and entering the
W&L maintenance shop on five
different occasions, August 8,
12, and 15, and September 15
and 16. He is also charged with

breaking into a house at 112 W.
Nelson St. on August 13.
The grand larceny charge in-

volves the theft of a Pioneer

stereo system belonging to
George N. Weatherly, a W&L
freshman living in Graham-
Lees Dormitory. The stereo,
which was recovered, was
valued at more than $200.

Smith was also charged with
the theft of some 53 record
albums from Russell ‘“‘Beaker’’
Stall in the August 13

SAB Favors Price

by Frank Billingsley

Fancy Dress tickets will cost
$20, or possibly $25, this year if
a current proposal passes the
Student Activities Board Sun-
day night.

A five-dollar increase would
give the board $30,000 for the
dance while a ten-dollar in-
crease would allow $37,500.
Fancy Dress is paid for totally
by the sale of tickets, which
have cost $15 since 1974.

Co-Chairman Pryse Elam
who introduced the idea at Sun-
day night’s meeting, explained
that the additional funds are
needed to pay for entertain-
ment. ‘‘We’re spending a lot
more money this year for enter-
tainment and can’t afford to
lose any money out of our
budget,” Elam said.

The SAB says it cannot give
any specific justification for the
extra money without revealing

break-in of the Munster House
on W. Nelson St.

Police have also charged the
W&L employee with three
counts of petty larceny, all
stemming from the August
break-ins at the maintenance
shop. He is charged with the
theft of a fire extinguisher, an
automobile battery, and wall
paper, all belonging to the
University.

Proposals

May Never
Pass

Monday night’s Executive
Committee meeting resulted in
eleven proposals that may
never become amendments to
the student body constitution.

Calling the student body con-
Stitution ‘‘six years out of
date,’’ EC president Bob Wilis
stressed the importance of
amending it to include the
eleven proposals approved at
the meeting.

We’ve got to go out of our way
to get these passed,’’ Willis
said.

But the student body constitu-
tion specifically states that any
amendments to the constitution
can only be passed when fifty
percent of the entire student
body votes on the proposals and
they pass by a two-thirds ma-
jority. ’

The committee expressed
concern that none of the amend-
ments would pass because of
student apathy.

“T am really afraid that all
the work we did tonight will go
to waste because not enough
students will vote next week,”’
EC member Jim Vines said.

Vines proposed a motion that
would permit the Executive
Committee to amend the con-
stitution simply by a two-thirds
vote of the committee. Students
would not vote on the matter. :

Willis urged all members of
the committee to campaign ac-
tively for student participation
in the proposed amendment
vote next week. The EC will
post notices around the Univer-
sity as well as contact the
fraternities reminding students
to vote.

We’ve got to get these pass-
ed,”’ said Willis.

Voting will take place during
student registration for winter
term. Polls will be set up in the
freshman quad, the law school
and in the registrar’s.office and
will be opened during. class
hours.

IFC More Of Same,
Some Of Other

by Mike Perry

Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent Monty Briscoe reported
results of a discussion he had
with Lexington town Manager
John Phillips and Dean of
Students Lewis John. Briscoe
Stated that Dean John is
prepared to sign amplified
noise permits, thus enabling
houses previously issued noise
ordinance violations. Frater-
nities placed on Social Proba-
tion will not be issued noise per-
mits.

Briscoe believes the noise
problem will lessen during the
Winter months when
“everybody closes their win-
dows,” but warned fraternities
that police will begin pro-
secuting the individuals obtain-
ing noise permits. ‘I can’t say
exactly how the Judicial Board
will interpret this; but I think
we will view individuals as

responsible.”’

On the subject of law enforce-
ment, Briscoe related Mayor-
Phillips concern that the Lex-

understaffed. Mayor Phillips
and University Proctor Charles
Murray urged student crime
victims to cooperate with police
efforts to prosecute suspects.

Briscoe added that Officer
Colbert can be particularly
helpful in this regard. Rob
Brooke said the police were
very effective in solving a
crime at the Phi Kappa Sigma
house. “It’s not always an im-
pressive judicial process, but it
works,” he said.

The police believe “there is a
small group of individuals com-
mitting these crimes” and can
usually be easily apprehended,
said Briscoe.

Fraternity representatives
from four houses complained
about services rendered under
the new fraternity maintenance
program. A Sigma Phi Epsilon
representative said that the
heat in their fraternity house
shut off the day after it was fix-
ed. Briscoe added that he knew
of an instance in which the Phi
Kappa Alpha house was “billed
twice for 25 light bulbs.”

Lechers And Harlots: Asian Studies

Dr. Donald Gillin, head of
Vassar College’s east Asian
studies program, will speak
today at Washington and Lee
University on the intriguing
topic ‘‘Lechers and Harlots:
American, Chinese . and
Japanese Images of One
Another’s Sexuality from 1900
to The Present.’’

Gillin’s visit to W&L and his 8
p.m. slide-lecture in duPont
Auditorium are sponsored by
Washington and Lee’s Asian
studies program.

Gillin received his Ph.D. from
Stanford in 1959 and has taught

More Excerpts

 

at several universities and has
been awarded a number of
research fellowships in the
United States and in the Orient.
He is the author of ‘Yen Hsi-

shan in Shansi Province,
1911-45,” a portrait of one of the
most important Chinese

warlords. He has also published
an east Asian bibliography for
undergraduate libraries, a
series of scholarly articles, and
book reviews in leading jour-
nals of history and Asian af-

_ fairs.

He is now at work on a multi-
volume study of the Chinese

civil way of 1945-49, a chapter of
which will appear in the for-
thcoming ‘‘Cambridge History
of China.”’

This will be Gillin’s second
visit to Washington and Lee.
During his first, two years ago,
he delivered another talk il-
lustrated with slides on the
topic of misconceptions of each
other in Chinese and American
media in the 20th century. That
presentation has since been
issued commercially by the
China Council of the Asia Socie-

President Comments On Fraternities

Editor’s Note: The following
comments were taken from
President Huntley’s speech to
parents on Parents’ Weekend.
The excerpts were selected and
printed by the news office.

... There are now, and always
will be, rough corners that need
repairing or smoothing, and
new things that need to be done.

There are, for example, ques-
tions about the future role of
fraternities. We have taken
some initiatives that we hope, in
cooperation with the students,
will assist and strengthen the
fraternity system here. We
think there are advantages to
fraternities, and there are also
some disadvantages. We hope
to find ways of maximizing the
former and minimizing the lat-
ter.

One side comment about that.
Some of the difficulties frater-
nities have, and have had for
the last several years (and pro-
bably will have for a while) are
not entirely the fault of the
students who are here now.
Some of the difficulties they en-
counter in their physical plants
and — in some cases — in the
ways in which they carry out
their operations reflect pro-
blems they found when they ar-
rived here. Most of whatever
deterioration there has been
has probably occurred in the

Engineering, International Affairs, Journalism; Law, Public Héalth,

Social Work, and Teacher’s' oe

last 15 or 20 years, a relatively
slow process, and it will take a
while to repair the damage that
those 15 or 20 years may have
brought — not just the physical
damage to the houses but the
damage to the concept of the
system.

I think, though I do not know
for certain, that the road up toa
new role for fraternities that
will be constructive has been
begun. I think the students on
campus — largely — wish to
continue to have the kind of
responsibility they have had in
the past for fraternity life and to

discharge that responsibility
more ably than perhaps
students in the last decade have
been able to do.

Our role — the University’s
role — is to provide every op-
portunity we can in the area of
fraternity life, as we do in every
other area of Washington and
Lee life, for students to develop
a sense of responsibility for
their own affairs. That is a part
of the educational philosophy of
this University, as I think you
well know.

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has begun a year-long, $1.1-

miltion renovation and
remodeling of one and a half
floors of its former law

building, Tucker Hall, to ac-
commodate the university’s
psychology department and
computer center.

The project is being under-
taken essentially in two phases.

In the first, the old law library .

reading room which occupied
the back half of Tucker Hall’s
main floor is being readied to
house the computer and a se-
cond level is being added in the
middle of the room to provide
offices and classrooms for the
psychology department.

Simultaneously, the front
part of Tucker’s basement is be-
ing remodeled to become a
cluster of laboratory and work
areas for experiments in
psychology.

Once the new computer
facilities are completed, about
Christmastime this year, the
computer itself, now operating
in temporary quarters in the
back part of the Tucker base-
ment, will be moved upstairs to
its new permanent location, and
work will commence to convert
that part of the basement into
other labs, offices, and teaching
and research facilities in
psychology.

That second part. of the
Tucker project is expected to be
completed next summer.

The new ‘“‘mezzanine”’ level in
the former law library is being
constructed as a kind of island

 

in the middle of the two-story -

room, in order to preserve the
architectural character that
distinguishes it.

The new story will provide
two psychology classrooms and
four faculty offices.

The computer center on the
main level will provide ample
work areas for students,
teachers, and the computer
staff in addition to the computer
itself.
academic records.

When the basement is com-
pleted, it will become the
teaching and research center
for W&L’s psychologists.

In addition to another faculty
office, the basement will have
several small laboratories that
will be used by teachers and
psychology students for re-
search, and most of the labs will

experiments in a wide range of
subfields of psychology.

There will be two laboratories
equipped for research in de-

stance, another for electro-
physiological experimentation
such as measurement of brain
waves, a lab for research into
perceptual phenomena, one for
psyometric testing and another
for psyometric testing.

Each of those subfields is one
in which W&L offers course-
work, and at least one W&L pro-
fessor is also actively engaged
in research in each.

The two psychology class-
rooms, which have been
specially designed, will be
equipped with videotape play-

The Tucker renovation will

There will be several small
rooms devoted to animal ex-

the Tucker basement being
renovated in the first phase of
the project. Jarrard has long
been a leading researcher into
the role of the hippocampus, a
portion of the brain, in
psychological and physical
disorders, and his chief
research subjects have been
white rats.

Two new entrances to the
building are being added, one
into the basement on the north
side to the rear, and another in
the middle of the south side,
toward the center of W&L’s Col-
onnade.

Washington and Lee’s fine
arts department will move into
the space in DuPont freed next
summer when the psychologists
complete their move to Tucker.

The Tucker renovation, an
element in W&L’s decade-long
62-million development plan, is
part of a general program to
provide badly needed additional
classroom, office and research
space for many of the under-
gradute departments in the
social sciences and humanities.

Own’), Richard Mogavero, directing.

DISCIPLE is a chattering magpie of a play, and
as the dialogue goeth, so goes the production.
Well, the dialogue went very well indeed. The
opening night slips we expected — and there were
only three — were few and far between. As a
result, our pulse-rate and our side-splitting guf-
faws -- quickened in exact time with the script.

Staging was bare, essential, and flawless. The
comfortable colonial clutter of a New England
home was suggested beautifully by an arrange-
ment which made the stage look lived upon while
allowing the actors leg room — no small feat in
W&L’s shoebox of a theatre. (One doubts the
University mentioned our sardine syndrome when
angling for Mr. Mogavero. )

Sets, obviously, had to bow to the exigencies of

our cozy, domestic arrangements...but you could
never tell. The bare, essential rendering con-
tributed to the deliberate unreality of the stage:
that peculiar magic of the theatre. Kudos to Elenn
Jervey for a truly professional job.

An aside: Sound and Lighting deserve a victory
dinner of some sort or another. The technical
aspects of production were up to scratch by any
standards. Mogavero’s personal choice of inciden-
tal music, chosen from the musical literature of
the period and taking its cue from certain indica-
tions by Bernard Shaw himseif, went far towards
effecting a triumph such as, indeed, resulted on
opening night. If we may advise The Powers That
Be (or, this being the theatre, Not To Be), we sug-
gest that they get the portion of the upper floor
that is directly above the seats soundproofed.
While footsteps of Celestial Doom over our head
are effective during Dudgeon’s trial, ‘Hey, Louie!’
during the reading of Old Dugeon’s will is
somewhat enervating. On the whole, however, we
can find no aspect of production lacking.

Ah, and now to business: individual perfor-
mances and an assessment of the play as a whole.
Opening night was a critic’s bane. Having spent
years mastering the fine art of verbal assault, we
can find no faults on which to train our tongue. All
our best insults are left hanging.

Mogavero’s abilities to work with and around
the Troubador’s limitations leave me breathless.
Rick Kukucka in the title role bestrides the stage
like a colossus; his transition from drawling rebel
to sacrificial victim is an epiphany of the first
water. (Good news, sports fans: the guy’s going to
be around for some time, too...) Carla Dillon turns
in a definitive performance as the ultimate virago
whose failure as a mother turned her son from the
straight and narrow. A delightful lady offstage,
Ms. Dillon, behind the spots, is the least-likely-to-
be tamed shrew we have seen since ‘‘Kiss Me,
Kate”’ was last on the Late Show.

New From Bruce

Commercial ‘River’ Flows
by Robin Meredith

For a man who reportedly
doesn’t care much about money
or (at least until recently)
publicity, Bruce Springsteen is
really one hell of a PR man. His
last three records have been
legendary even before their-
release; his album (Darkness
On the Edge of Town and tour
of the summer of ’78 successful-
ly overshadowed the Stone’s

 

Recordings

 

tour (their most extensive ever
in the states) and album (their
best-selling to date) of the same
summer, and it could
reasonably be said that no artist
has ever been catapulted into
the national spotlight faster
than Bruce was by the events
. Surrounding Born to Run’s
release in 1975. Now, we have
The River. A two-record set,
released after months of edge-
of-the-seat anticipation (but
surprisingly little media fan-
fare), Springsteen’s fifth album
is his most commercially
palatable to date. It includes
what could well be his first ma-
jor single hit (“Hungry Heart’’)
and should win him legions of
new admirers. without
alienating any of the diehards
(something that could not be
said about Darkness). The
River is a great rock’n’roll
album, but when you’re dealing
with an artist of Springsteen’s
stature, one larger question
must be addressed; is The
River a _ great Springsteen
album??

The first thing you’re likely to
notice about this record (say,
by the time you get halfway
through side two) is how damn-
ed happy Bruce sounds. The
River puts Springsteen’s career

into perspective in impressive
fashion; four lines from ‘“Two
Hearts” — Once I spent my
time playing tough guy scenes
/but I was living in a world of
childish dreams / someday
these childish dreams must end
/ to become a man and grow up
to dream again’’ — summarize
the progression from Born To
Run to Darkness to The River.
Bruce has exorcised the
demons that made Darkness
such a downer; songs like
“Sherry Darling’ (his ‘Frat
Rock” song) and “I wanna
Marry You’’ harken back to
pre-1965 romanticism, and with
such hard-nosed rockers as
“Crush On You,” “You Can
Look (But You Better Not

Touch),” ‘I’m a_ Rocker,”
“Cadillac Ranch,’’ and
“Ramrod,” he has finally

begun to write his own versions
of the oldies he loves so much,
angry, rebellious, funny, guitar-
driven songs that rock harder
than anything he’s done before.

These are the songs that will
be especially attractive to those
whose first contact with Spr-
ingsteen comes through The
River. The funny typed into two
distinct groups. On one hand,
the songs mentioned above,
along with ‘‘Out In The Street”
and ‘‘Hungry Heart,” define a

Sea Level Cooks

by Ross Newell

Chuck Leavell shot basketball in Doremus Gym
Friday afternoon, retracing footsteps left by
Duane Allman nine years earlier when the Allman
Brothers played at W&L. Deja vous anticipation.

Sea Level was the best buzz available in Lex-
ington this weekend. They were the real rush, the
franchise of homecoming.

The rainy reality outside the gym contrasted
with the climactic bliss. Indeed, many thought
they were living in a dream as they watched the
piano pounding perfectionist and his band do it up
in a classic performance Friday night.

Leavell had been wearing gloves all afternoon to
keep his hands warm, and there seemed to be fire
in his finger tips as the band opened with “‘Fifty-~
Four.”

The crowd had fire in their eyes. The reception
they gave Sea Level would have made Jack Em-
mer jealous. Leavell appreciated it. ‘“‘One of the
most receptive crowds we’ve ever played to,”’ he
said after the show.

The second and third songs, ‘‘Anxiously
Awaiting’ and “Living in a Dream,”’ further
established the atmosphere of the concert. The at-
mosphere was charged with energy, but it was
controlled rather than rowdy. Just right for the
delivery of Sea Level’s jazz-rock music.

From the beginning, it was clear that the band
enjoyed the concert as much as the fans did. The
band’s new bass player, Paul Brodeur, played
some riffs that would have turned Stanley Clark’s
head. At times it was unclear which was moving
faster, Brodeur’s feet or his fingers. Rarely stan-
ding still, Brodeur contributed much to Sea
Level’s stage presence.

The band played all of the new album
‘“‘Ballroom’’ and the songs sounded better live
than they do on the album. Many critics consider
the album a switch in musical direction away
from jazz and towards rock.

However the transition was smooth Friday night
as: the band alternated between old and new
material with little trouble. Classic Sea Level
songs much as “‘Grand Larceny,”’ ‘‘That’s Your
Secret,” and ‘‘Rain in Spain,’ on which the band
built its early reputation as powerful instrumen-
talists, were well received by the audience.

And, when it came time to ‘‘Share a Leg,” a
song from the band’s first album, few of those on
the floor needed further coaxing. It was obvious
that the rope stretched in front of the stage would
fall before the crowd with as little difficulty as
Atlanta fell before Sherman, and with about the
same amount of smoke.

By the second encore the stage hands up front
had stopped saying ‘‘move back, get behind the
rope’’ and started yelling ‘“Go Chuck.’’ No sense in
being stubborn, it’s not everyday that a band like
Sea Level stops by Lexington for anything other
than a clean restroom or a cup of coffee.

Perhaps the highlight of the encores was
“School Teacher” from ‘Ballroom.’ Guitarist
Davis Causey and Jimmy Nalls switched off some
mean leads; Randall Bramblett belted out the
vocals; percusionists Matt Greeley and Steve
Kent established an energetic beat, and Leavell,
the all-bad, played the piano like only he can.

Poor acoustics in Doremus gym detracted from
the band’s music, which, unlike
much of the music on the market today, has a firm
basis in quality.

The emphasis on quality has persisted since the
band’s beginning in 1977. Early that year Leavell,
Jaimoe Johnson and Lamar Williams, of the
Allman Brothers Band, and George Weaver and
Jimmy Nalls recorded ‘‘Sea Level.”’

Later in 1977, Bramblett, on saxophone and
‘keyboards, and Causey, on guitar, joined the
band and contributed further variety to its music.

“Cats on the Coast” was released in 1978 and a
single from the album, ‘“‘That’s Your Secret”
made the charts and increased the band’s follow-
ing. Also in 1978, Sea Level went on a European
tour that included a performance at the Montreux
Jazz Festival in Switzerland. During this time,
Leavell’s ability on the piano and keyboards and
Bramblett’s ability on the saxophone and organ
won critical acclaim in the music world.

Following the tour Weaver left Sea Level and
was replaced by Joe English, who had been a
drummer for Wings. After this personnel change,
the band released ‘‘On the Edge.”

Between ‘‘On the Edge’’ and the most recent
release “Ballroom”’ Sea Level cut another album
never released in the United States because of con-
tractual problems with the now defunct Capricorn
Records. This album, ‘‘Long Walk on a Short
Pier’ was the beginning of a new direction
towards vocal oriented rock that characterizes
“‘Ballroom.”’

The road manager said the new musical direc-
tion was a logical outgrowth of the progressive
and innovative nature of the band.

Leavell said that the new direction and new per-
sonnel have given the band a stronger feeling of
unity and energy that existed in the past.

If the concert Friday night was any indication,
Leavell is as accurate in his analysis as he is in
playing the piano.

 

new style which shows Bruce

better than the live version

teen album? Probably. Through

 

emphasizing performance over
lyrical content for the first time
— lyrically, some of these come
close to being throwaways. On
the other hand, The River’s
ballads (‘‘Independence Day,”’
“Point Blank,” ‘Stolen Car,”
“Drive All Night,”’ ‘Wreck On
The Highway,” and the title
track) are as a group Springs-
teen’s most dramatic, powerful,
and moving work to date.
‘Point Blank” has been rewrit-
ten since the ’78 tour and is far

would have led you to suspect.
“Wreck On The Highway”’ is
heart-wrenching in its simplici-
ty, “The River’ a masterpiece
of storytelling, and ‘Stolen
Car’”’ the most sonically
devastating ballad Bruce has
done yet. The only problem with
this sort of fast/slow, hap-
py/sad dichotomy is the lack of
any truly heartfelt rockers in
the spirit of ‘“Thunder Road”’ or
““Badlands.”’

Is The River a great Springs-

it, we see a fun-loving side of the
boss that hasn’t shown its face
since ‘Rosalita.’’ Through it,
Bruce shows that he is still in
full command of all his lyrical
and musical powers. Through
it, we see the E Street Band as,
once and for all, the greatest
back-up ensemble of all time.
Through it, the production team

cessfully combined the hard-

Commentary:

A Stunning Victory

by Ralph Frasca

Coming off last week’s stun-
ning, inspiring victory, the
Generals looked like a sure bet
to enter last Saturday’s game
against Sewanee with their
heads in the clouds. It occurred
to more than one fan that the
Generals might be due for a
fall, according to the old axiom,
“What goes up must come
down.”’ But they simply refused
to be denied, and captured their
final home game of the season,
20-14.

The major concern of all in-
volved was the field condition.
It had rained the night before
the game, and a continuous
drizzle dampened the skin but
not the spirits of hardy fans
throughout the game. The field
degenerated to a quagmire, and
the contest could only be
described as ‘‘The Battle of Big
Muddy.”

After the Generals missed
two field goals, Sewanee should
have remotely considered the
possibility of a fake field goal on
fourth down and short yardage.
But they were caught complete-
ly by surprise when Chris
Leiser hauled in a pass from
field goal holder Rich
Hachenberg and carried it to
the one-yard line. It seemed on-
ly fitting that Leiser should
punch through the Tigers’
defense for the first score.

Tailback Kenny Robinson
was responsible for the second
tally. An overnight hero as a
result of his 71-yard perfor-
mance against Hampden-
Sydney two weekends ago,
Robinson moved the ball at will
against Sewanee’s porous
defense, finally driving to the
one, where the Generals
threatened on second down. A
substitute was then sent in,
much to the outrage of fans,
who shouted, ‘‘Put Kenny in!”
On third-and-two he returned,
no doubt bearing a play from
Coach Fallon. If you were in the

Varsity

by Phil Murray

The varsity lacrosse team
evened the series record at 3-3
with the Alumni this weekend in
the sixth annual Alumni
Lacrosse Game by defeating
the former W&L stars 18-10.

The Alumni team boasted a
number of former All-
Americans including three All-
American goalies: Skeet Chad-
wick ’74, Charlie Brown ’78 and
Bob Clements, and three U.S.
World Team members: Chad-
wick, Tom Keigler ’77, and Skip
Lichtfull ’74.

The Alumni team started fast

stands then, you knew the bail
was going to Robinson. He
scored on a right side sweep,
thanks to some crucial blocking
from the offensive line.

The third tally was registered
by Mike Fogarty, who was open
in the defensive backfield all
day long. One fan mused, “‘he’s
alwasy open because he’s too
big to cover.’’ That must cer-
tainly be the case, for the hulk-
ing tight end is certainly too
large to overlook. ‘Always
Open’ Fogarty’s touchdown
raised the score to 20-7, and fans
began streaming from the
stands. However, Sewanee’s
comatose offense suddenly
came to life and drove in for the
score, narrowing the gap to six
points.

It’s nice to have friends in
high places, though, and the
clock on the scoreboard was a
true comrade of the Generals.
Only a few minutes remained,
and the White-and-Blue crew
had simply to accumulate a few
first downs, and the game was
theirs. But first downs were in
short supply then, and the
Generals were forced to punt.

One touchdown could snatch
victory from the jaws of defeat
for the Tigers, and the two miss-
ed field goals and two unsuc:
cessful extra point attempts
loomed ever larger. However,
the Sack Pack defense
obliterated any designs on vic-
tory their opponents may have
possessed. Helping quarterback
Robert Holland examine the
field conditions at closer range
than he wished to, the Generals’
defense held tough, their efforts
culminating in a game-ending
interception by Gene Fellin.

The spectacular victory was
secure, the upset achieved.
There were no individual stars,
simply a consistent offense and
a voracious defense. Teamwork
earmarked this game, folks,
and the Falcon’s boys should be
proud.

But then the Varsity took com-

mand, scoring four unanswered
goals to lead 4-1 at the end of the
first period.

The varsity held onto their
lead through the second period
and led at the half 7-3.

But the Alumni came out
strong in the second half with
two quick goals and looked like
they might overtake the Varsi-
ty. They stayed within two goals
for most of the third period but
could get nv closer.

Booters Blank Keydets, 3-0

by Mark Schramm

It proved to be a tough week
for the Generals, as they drop-
ped a key match to ODAC rival
Roanoke 3-1 before rebounding
to beat VMI by the game score.
Although their record now
stands at 7-3, the loss dimmed
their hopes of reaching the
ODAC playoffs.

Despite convincing victories
in their last three games, the
Generals started poorly against
Roanoke and never seemed to
get untracked. Roanoke scored
early in the first half, and ap-
plied steady pressure.

The W&L defense was up to
the task, however. Fullbacks
Steve Smith and Mark Sullivan,
who shared Player of the Game
awards, aggressively attacked
the ball and cleared the zone,
and Goalie Kevin Carney made

 

several key saves.

The second half proved
frustrating. Roanoke scored
their second goal, but the tide
seemed to be swinging to the
other side, as W&L made their
presence felt around the
Roanoke net.

Their perseverence paid off,
as Brad Poorman was fouled in
the penalty area. The Generals’

Alumni

The younger players finally
pulled away as the Varsity
speed proved too much for the
Alumni and won easily 18-10.

Coach Jack Emmer was im-
mensely pleased with the play
of his team and came away “op-

timistic” about the upcoming
season,

Pere Roberts had an outstan-
ding game with four goals and
two assists. Also, Mike Lewers
and John Kemp contributed two
goals and two assists apiece.

penalty specialist, Bryan
Williams, was injured however,

and Poorman’s kick was wide of

the post.

Roanoke added another goal,
but the Generals refused to give
up, and Roland Simon tallied
his sixth goal. A ball was chip-
ped downfield, and Simon
outraced his defender to it. “I
had my back to the goal,” the
high-scoring freshman said,
“‘and I just twisted around and
got off a shot.” His 20 yarder

caught the goalie off guard, and .

the ball skimmed just inside the
far post.

The Generals had an addi-
tional opportunity when they
received another penalty kick,
but Ben Muskin’s blast was
stopped short by a quick lunge

_ from the Roanoke goaltender.

v

When asked if the earlier con-
troversy with Roland Simon
had a negative effect on the
team’s play, Coach Rolf Pira-
nian said, “That was no pro-
blem at all. Roland called me
the day the article came out and
explained everything. I think
that shows what kind of guy he
is.”

Simon, making the usual ex-
cuse, said, ‘‘My comments were
taken out of context.” “‘There’s
not a guy on this team that
doesn’t have the utmost respect
for Coach. I know he’s really
helped me improve my play.”

Their fortunes improved
against VMI, as the Generals
walked off with a 3-1 victory.

Despite playing without four
key players and having several
others out of position, W&L
scored early and the issue was
never in question.

Roland Simon scored at the
4:00 mark, as Brad Poorman
beat his defender down the wing
and dropped a pass right on
Simon’s foot just six yards from
the goal. Simon simply tapped
the ball into the open net.

“TI figure that if I don’t score
goals, I’m not doing my job,” he
said. “With guys like Brad
Poorman, Tom Elder, and
Jerry Moyer feeding me, I know
I’m gonna get the chance.”

Simon performed his sole
function as he scored in the se-
cond half. He intercepted a
wayward VMI pass and smack-
ed a shot on the volley just
under the crossbar. It was his
eighth goal of the season,

The Generals added a third
goal near the end of the match.
Tad Renner passed upfield to
Ben Muskin. The steady mid-
fielder headed the ball to Mark
Sullivan, who crossed to Simon.
Simon passed to Mark Turner,
and the senior forward’s shot
was right on target.

Steve Smith and Paul Ritter
shared Player of the Game
awards with Roland Simon.
“Steve is a big asset to our
defense,’’ Coach Piranian said,
‘“He’s not easily intimidated.”
Ritter was playing in his final
match for the Generals, as he
had to withdraw from school.
The intense midfield play of the
Pennsylvania sophomore will
be sorely felt.

Despite having only one
ODAC loss, the Generals

playoff hopes depend on the per-
formance of undefeated Lynch-
burg. Should they play im-
preeively in their final three
games, they should qualify for a
bid to the NCAA playoffs.

Generals Humble Sewanee In Rain, 20-14

by Dale Park

On a muddy Wilson Field last
Saturday, the Washington ‘and
Lee varsity football team made
it two in a row with an exciting
20-14 win over the Sewanee
Tigers.

The victory lifted W&L’s
overall record to 5-2.

“‘We have a knack for making
these games thrillers,’ said
head coach Gary Fallon. ‘‘But
it’s a lot more enjoyable to be
winning the close ones rather
than losing them.”’

In the first 16 minutes of play,
the Generals mounted two
substantial drives only to be
stopped inside the 25 yard line
both times. Although the
Generals had dominated play,
two Bill Devine field goal at-
tempts missed their mark and
W&L came away empty.

On the very next possession
following Devine’s second er-
ront try, the Generals drove to
the Tiger 11 yard line where the
drive stalled. Devine was then
sent out for an apparent field

goal try.

Instead, junior quarterback
Rich Hachenburg took the snap,
stood up, and fired a pass to
senior slotback Chris Leiser.
Leiser made it all the way to the

7 Mike Foggerty snares pass in action against Sewanee Saturday.

one yard line and, on the very
next play, dove in for the score.

‘Devine was a little off,”
stated Fallon, ‘‘and we had
been practicing a fake field goal
play since day one. Hachenburg
and Leiser did an excellent job
of executing it.” The extra point
was failed, and W&L led 6-0.

 

On the next possession
Hachenburg moved the
Generals 60 yards in nine plays
for a touchdown capped by
sophomore tailback Ken Robin-
son’s two yard scoring run (the
point after was again unsuc-
cessful.

“Robinson is a_ hungry

 

player,”’ commented Fallon,
‘and it shows in his play. He
gives our offense a new dimen-
sion and gives Leiser a
breather.”’

On the afternoon, Robinson
gained 83 yards on 17 carries,
while Leiser, the game’s
leading rusher, picked up 114
yards on 26 attempts. Said
Fallon, ‘“‘Leiser has those quick,
short steps which are important

‘in muddy conditions.”

In all, W&L_ outrushed
Sewanee 255 yards to 51.

Sewanee struck back on a six
yard touchdown pass in the
third quarter to cut the W&L
lead to 12-7. The Generals
responded early in the fourth

quarter as Hachenburg (who
completed 11 of 17 for 103 yards)
found junior tight end Mike
Fogarty in the end zone. A two
point conversion extended
W&L’s lead to 20-7.

“Fogarty came up with some
big catches for us,’ stated
Fallon. ‘“He’s a big target and
now other teams will have to
look at him more closely.”

Fogarty caught five passes
for 56 yards and one touchdown.

Sewanee was not finished,
however. With only three

minutes left to play the Tigers
scored on a one yard touchdown
dive. The successful point after
moved Sewanee to within six
points, 20-14.

But for the remainder of the
game the W&L_ defense,
especially the pass rush, stiffen-
ed. Sewanee’s final drive was
stopped short as sophomore
defensive back Gene Fellin in-
tercepted a Tiger pass and end-

- ed the game.
Commented Fallon: ‘With
Nickels (junior defensive

tackle) not at full strength and
with Davis (senior defensive
tackle) injured, our pass rush
relied on young players. Even
with the equipment getting
muddy and heavy, the line kept
the pressure on the Sewanee
quarterback all afternoon and
did an excellent job.”

The defensive effort last
Saturday was good practice for
next Saturday’s away game
against Bridgewater.

Bridgewater quarterback
Duane Harrison was last year’s
ODAC passing and punting
champ and ‘“‘kept us off balance
all game long last time,”’ said
Fallon.

Water Polo Team Triumphs In Tourney

by Dave Johnson

The W&L water polo team at-
tained one of their most impor-
tant goals for the season last
weekend as they defeated the
University of Richmond 9-4 in
the decisive game of the
Southern Water Polo League
Tournament. In their other
games of the weekend, the
Generals defeated Hampden-
Sydney by the lopsided score of
27-2, and rolled over the U.N.C.
‘“‘A”’ and “‘B” squads by scores
of 16-4 and 15-0.

These four games comprised
the second half of a tournament
that began two weeks before at
Richmond, and the Generals
trailed the Spiders by one game
coming into the weekend. Both
the W&L and Richmond teams
ended the tourney with seven
wins and one loss, but due to the

great number of goals scored by
the Generals as opposed to

goals against, W&L is the tour-
nament victor.

The Richmond game started
off ominously for the Generals,
as the Spiders jumped out to a

quick 20 lead in the first
quarter. W&L called a quick
time out, made some rear-
rangements in their offense,
and came back to take a 4-3 lead
at halftime. Despite the initial
two goals by Richmond, the
Generals appeared to be play-
ing a tighter, more determined,
and more cooperative defense
than has yet been seen this
year. Defender Bob Marshall
had an excellent game and was
what Coach Page Remillard

called ‘very effective’ in
aiding the W&L effort.
The two teams traded goals in

the third period, and with the
Generals in the lead 5-4 entering
the fourth period, the Spiders
seemed to lose some of their
composure and made critical
errors. Richmond committed

- numerous fouls and was forced

to play a man short in several
situations. They also allowed
two penalty shots, and thus suf-
fered a 9-4 defeat at the hands of
the Generals.

In citing outstanding players
for the weekend, Coach
Remillard named almost
everyone, down to the company

that makes the water polo balls,
but he was particularly pleased
with Marshall, junior Steve
Laprade, who played well as a
release man, and freshman
goalie Andy Gates, who earned
the tag “‘superb.” Junior Cap-
tain Mike Bernot directed the
offense and accumulated a
team high of 14 points for three

‘games, four of which came

against Richmond.

Remillard and his team were
also quite pleased with the
vocal and participatory crowd
that packed the pool gallery for
Said

the Richmond game.

  

Remillard, ‘““We were glad they
were there; they certainly
helped quench our thirst for vic-
tory,” and he offered a large
“HOOOYA, TOOOYAA” to the
.fans.

Next weekend the Generals
host the Virginia State Tourna-
ment, which will include many
of the same teams as last
week’s notably Richmond. The

tourney will be held on Sat. and
Sun., with W&L taking on Rich-
mond at 5 p.m. Saturday.

Elam said the board would
not arbitrarily push a raise just

but would consider whether the
way in which the funds were
spent would be worth the extra
cost to the students.

By order of the Executive

On The Road To Baldwin

For one reason or another,
many Washington and Lee
students do not make the drive
north: on Route 81 to Mary
Baldwin women’s college in
Staunton. Students at W&L
seem apathetic about one of the
most spirited colleges in the
area, yet has not been given a
nickname that we can print
without getting in trouble. It
seems the only time Minks go to
Baldwin is after all the other
schools and dates leave the
state for the summer. Then
there is no choice.

The drive to Baldwin is about
as exciting as grits. Route 81 is
boring and the fact the drive is
short is its only saving grace.
Upon arriving in Staunton, it is
not too difficult to find a parking
space, though one generally has
to know someone in the dorms
to get in. More so than at the

other schools, male guests haye
to be escorted at all times in the
dorms and it is difficult to
roam. If the average Mink is
fortunate enough to get a date
or happens to know someone at
Baldwin, the best thing to do is
grab her and hit one of the local
bars. The Red Line is an ex-
cellent place to stop for a drink.
Baldwin also has parties in the
Staunton Military Academy, a
building best described as too
big for a small party and too
small for a big party. Some

. have compared the hall to a

ceramic barn. Unlike some
other Mink party spots,
Baldwin has been known to
serve cold beer, though there is
seldom enough. But Baldwin
has also served minors and
there were major repercussions
with the State Board of Alcohol
Control. Try not to get caught
drinking on campus or within a

hundred miles of the ABC in-
spectors, wherever they are.

There is really only one thing
that makes Baldwin different
from any other school in the
area; the sidewalks are heated
in the winter. Unfortunately,
they are probably the only
warm things in the area. Minkss
can also compete with Wahoos,,
Hampsters and Keydets at
Baldwin. The strange thing is,
one quickly discovers how
similar the schools really are,
and how Minks, Wahoos, Vee-
Mees, and Hampsters are real-
ly after the same thing.

Probably the best way to
remember a trip to Baldwin is
to stop and eat at White’s Truck
‘Stop. Most students at W&L will
tell you that the food at White’s
is better than the parties at
Baldwin. But White’s doesn’t
have heated sidewalks.

 

Devil’s Disciple

Tom Conners, who’ll go far if he can keep a
‘straight face, was quite plausible as-the slow-
‘ witted bumpkin of a brother with whom Our Hero
is saddled (sound familiar? ). Jeff Wells, represen-
ting both Church and State — we promise not to
tell the Supreme Court — is a trifle campy, but
quite enjoyable.

And now — ruffles and flourishes, please — we
come to Al Gordon, who had to pull double duty
opening night by taking over the role of Uncle
Titus in the absence of Carter McNeese. As Uncle
Titus, Gordon is greased lightning — literally, for
the role flits but briefly across the stage and re-
quires the actor to pack sixteen centuries of
hereditary corruption and general oiliness into a
few seconds of dramatic life. And as the aptly
named ‘Gentleman Johnny” Burgoyne, Gordon
succeeds in actually stealing scenes from young
Kukucka — perhaps the only one who could. The
man doubtless prepared for the role by watching
‘Firing Line’? — he plays Burgoyne the way
William Buckley plays Buckley: the supra-mobile
face; the distaste for vulgarity — including the
word “vulgar”; the drawl; the overall,
aristocratic long-leggedness. A bravura perfor-
mance.

And — this is a pleasure — we come at last to the
delectable Nancy Stone. The lady was lovely-in
every sense of the word, her performance not least

 

(continued from page 4)

of all. It has been too long since we have seen such
projection. For a few brief hours, the distinction
between the Real and the Stage was non-existent.

Richard Boaz, who begins his demanding role as
the clerical embodiment of Extreme Unction and
must end it as a colonial Charlemagne...does.
That bespeaks no mean degree of skill. Laurie
Price as Essie the serving girl is quite a convinc-
ing peasant, Anthony Wallace is all we could wish
as the circumstantially pompous Major Swindon,
and Drew Perkin’s exquisitely played Sergeant
left us musing on Wellington’s assessment of his
infantry: ‘‘The scum of the earth, sir, the scum of
the earth.’’ Keith Shillington’s dignified portrayal
of Uncle Will charmed us, Laura de Maria and
Rose Gordon (whom Bernard Shaw wisely did not
promise us — she is a special treat whose presence
is yet another thing for which we thank Mr.
Mogavero) left us beaming, and the British
soldiers lived up to Swindon’s and Nelson’s expec-
tion by doing their duty. ;

If you go to see the play — and we think you
MUST — pay special attention to the reading of
the Will and to the trial. The play is at its best in
these comedies of manners.

We have only praise and a few faint damns for
the production. Oh, and one question: what, Mr.
Mogavero, will you do for a much merited encore?

Saga Of Georgia Professor
Transcends Boundaries Of Justice

by Jack Sharman

Hey kids, it’s time to once again play everybody’s favorite game,
Pin The Tail On The Sex Discriminator! In our shining republic’s
Long March towards an egalitarianism tackier than anybody else’s
egalitarianism, there have been suits brought against those accus-
ed of: discriminating against blacks, against whites, against
Chicanos, lesbians, homosexuals, the elderly, the young, girls be-
ing on football teams, boys being in Girl Scouts, men joining
sororities, and, unfortunately, against alcoholics.

But the golden issue is that of discrimination against women. Ah,
Feminism! How lightly the winds of enlightenment blow ’gainst
they indignant breasts! The answer, gentlemen, is simple:
mobilize Sweet Briar, and we shall never have to worry again about
the Red Chinese. The feminist movement has, of course, plumbed
the Marianas Trench of foolishness, but now the Cause has fostered
a serious development: the imprisonment of an innocent man.

James Dinnan is a professor of education at the University of
Georgia. This week, he was released from jail after serving ninety
days, before which he paid a $3,000 fine. For what noxious activity?
For refusing to reveal how he voted ata peer-review session that
considered faculty members up for tenure. On a vote of six to three,
the Georgia review committee turned down the application for
tenure of Maija Blaubergs, which constituted her third failure in
three years. Ms. Blaubergs is a psycholinguist and, naturally, what
else could a dignified female psycholinguist do, save file a
suit charging sex discrimination?

Wilbur Owens Jr. was the federal district court judge who heard
the case. Judge Owens, no doubt, eats Wheaties. This ain’t a case of
academic freedom, boy, Judge Owens intoned betweeen mouthfuls.

 

 

“Bll Rise"

You’re withholding evidence from me, under the Civil Rights Act of
1964. Dinnan adamantly refused to say how he voted, but asked, “If
academic freedom is not the right to judge one’s peers free from

outside pressure or intimidation, then what is it?’’ To this I could
not find His Honor’s reply, so I assume he opened another cereal
box. Owens fined Dinnan $100 a day for thirty days, then threw him
in jail. The case will go before the Fifth Circuit.

The question of Blaubergs per se can be disposed of with relative
ease. The University of Georgia’s vice-president for academic af-
fairs is a woman: Virginia Trotter, who was at one time Assistant
Secretary for Education at HEW. She said:

“T chaired the final review committee, and I feel Blaubergs had
every chance every step of the way. Over a three-year period, her
case was reviewed by nine committees. She did not present convin-
cing evidence of her teaching skills, and she displayed no sense of
growth in her academic specialty. (Time, October 6, 1980).”’

Apparently, Maija Blaubergs lacks sufficient competence to be
awarded tenure, and her suit is petty from its inception. Such ques-
tions as tenure are between Blaubergs and her fellow faculty
members.

A more important question is: What in the hell is Judge Wilbur
“Wheaties” Owens Jr. doing in there? The Civil Rights Act of 1964
is an important and wide-ranging document; it does not, however,
give ‘‘Wheaties’’ the right to toss a professor in the clink because
that professor refused to disclose how he voted in a private meeting
over an academic question, the privacy of that meeting being a
prerequisite for achieving the very impartiality Blaubergs and
“Wheaties” purpose to champion. Hell, let the media televise

_Teview committees from now on, with Barbara Walters mumbling

profundities on the sidelines, between cameo flashbacks, in color,
of Bella Abzug’s pubescent years. The saga of Blaubergs, Dinnan,

- and ‘‘Wheaties”’ transcends the boundaries of ‘‘justice” and makes

eyes at another title, that of “ubiquitous and _ tyrannical
foolishness.”’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK |

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Vote ‘NO’ Once

For three days next week the Student Body will
have a chance to update a student body constitution
which Executive Committee President Bob Willis ad-
mits is ‘‘six years out of date.’’ We urge students to
vote for all of these admendments, except one.

Once again, the Ring-tum Phi finds itself at odds
with the Executive Committee on the subject of the
Publications Board. Last year the Executive Commit-
tee saw fit to remove money from the Publications
Board Reserve Fund — an account the EC has no
right or power to touch. The EC returned the money
the next week, but one still must question exactly
what the Committee had in mind and if pressure from
the student body brought the money back to the Pub
Board. In another instance the Executive Committee
violated its own Constitution and the Publications
Board Constitution by taking salaries away from stu-
dent editors. The EC also failed to inform any other
editors that the matter was to be discussed.

We have no reason to believe anyone on the Ex-
ecutive Committee is trying to take over Ring-tum
Phi, CALYX, or Ariel — yet at the same time we see a
disturbing trend in which the EC goes out and takes
what it wants. This is apparent in the EC’s perfor-
mance of its administrative duties, the honor code im-
plications are frightening. If the Executive Commit-
tee cannot interpret a simple constitution, how can it
conduct an honor hearing?

The Executive Committee has asked to change its
power of appellate review over the publications to a
power of review. Jim Vines, the EC’s representative
to the Publications Board cast the only dissenting
vote. The one peron on the EC to have some ex-
perience with the Publications Board voted against
the Admendment. We think you should do the same.
We do not want the Student Body President writing
editorials nor directly influencing the editorial policy
of the newspaper. The Executive Committee has
deservedly been granted a large measure of power,
but it would be foolish to place the one autonomous
campus publication which can check this power under
the EC’s direct review.

Them Lexington Blues

Dear Editor:

I would like to address my
statements to anyone who has
been suffering from a case of
the Lexington blues. As a junior
here at W&L I’ve witnessed
numerous cases of this
disorder, especially among the
GDI’s. The L. blues find their
way into a suitable host via a
bored and restless mental con-
dition, usually in conjunction

with weekends. Symptomatic of
this illness is a gloomy, cynical

and sarcastic outlook on life in

the W&L community. Lexington
blues can lead to chronic
depression and _ discontent,
lasting up to four years in their
most extreme form.

To those of you who believe
themselves to suffer from this
grave malady, let me recom-
mend a generous dosage of

EC President Explains
Admendment Purpose

Dear Editor,

Last Monday evening, the Ex-
ecutive Committee proposed a
series of revisions for the Stu-
dent Body Constitution. The
purpose of these amendments is
to clarify ambiguous language
and to bring into harmony the
constitution and the current
operating procedures of student
government agencies.

For an amendment to be
adopted, at least one-half of the
student body must vote and two-
thirds of those voting must ap-
prove the proposal. Therefore,

the Executive Committee not
only urges all students to vote,
but also encourages them to
support its proposals. .

Students may vote at the
Registrar’s Office, the
Freshman Dormitories, or
Lewis Hall from Tuesday,
November 4, through Thursday,
November 6. Details of the
specific proposals are in this
week’s Executive Committee
minutes.

Thank you. Sincerely,
Robert H. Willis, Jr.
President

For the more robust there are

Spectator and Homecoming

“And the Homecoming Queen is...” ...Boo!

ting averages. The second and most common use

Hiss! Boo! I think I’m going to be sick. Is this a
cruel joke or is this just Washington and Lee? At
any rate, the mock beauty has her crown; the
great mock weekend is over; the grand parties

and wild weekends are but distant memories. The

fraternities are broke. But do not despair, for this
is springtime in the wooded hills of Lexington.
Yes, for one short week Washington and Lee is tru-
ly an exciting place. For this is mink week, or
mink-mating season, and all our furry friends
come inside when they bed down for the winter.

A few premature minks have already come in-
side, but this only a small problem. The majority
have stayed the urge; the warm caverns will be
truly inviting...a fine reward and deserved climax
to a bitter cold fall. Now the Lexington mink
(prideless fninkus) is a curious creature. He’s on-

ly fifteen inches long, but he has an eight inch tail,
which can be used in a number of ways.

First, since the tail is so long and wide, minks
are fine ball players and most have excellent bat-

is to show affection by the tail’s elevation and
rigidity. The mink also uses his tail to deceive his
mate. Since the rear and front of the beast are so
similar in size, shape, and fluffiness, the mink, if
he does not want a kiss to the lips, just offers his
flaccidtail. This maneuver requires great skill and
dexterity, though, as the female has been known to
take a bite or two. Perhaps you have heard of the
ring-tailed mink. In most cases, however, the
male mink is instantly affected and demonstrates
this with a corresponding elevation of the tail.

Now I hesitate to deccribe the fourth and last
use, but since this is mating season, I feel my
words have a certain biolosical necessity. After
all, you do want to know how it’s done, and we
don’t want any unsatisfied minxettes at the end of

the week. Well, the mink raises his turgid tail, and
with pronounced anal movements, he secretes a
powerful, rancid effluvium, which permeates the
female’s nasal orifice. This basically knocks her
out cold, whereupon the male does with her as he
pleases.
Briar Blasts Dwyer

A news article appeared in
The Sweet Briar News on Oc-

tober 9 which recounted the,

event of Sweet Briar women
protesting at Ronald Reagan
Headquarters in Lynchburg.
The article states that: ‘‘The
main reason for the protest was
against Jerry Falwell and the
fact Ronald Reagan would use
him to advance his political
standing.”’

The article also states:
“Jerry Falwell and Ronald
Reagan are both against the
ERA and that was another ele-
ment that inspired the protest.”’

The Sweet Briar News
received a letter to the editor
from Kevin B. Dwyer, W&L ’81,
which appears in the October 16
issue. Mr. Dwyer expresses his
concern over the protest and
begins his letter: ‘‘I was sur-
prised to read of a Sweet Briar
student protest at Republican
Headquarters in Lynchburg
against Ronald Reagan for his
Friday, October 3 visit to Liber-
ty Baptist College.”

Well, Mr. Dwyer, if you had
read the article carefully
perhaps you would have had a
better understanding of what
“the main reason for the protest
was...’’ I would like to question
your ‘‘surprise’’ — does it really
surprise you that some people
don’t share the same opinions
you do? Colleges today are sup-
posed to offer a different point
of view in the classroom — for-
tunately Sweet Briar does.

d

 

Mr. Dwyer proceeds in his let-
ter to point out several points
where Mr. Falwell and Gover-
nor Reagan disagree on issues.
The Sweet Briar women were
not protesting the fine lines of
political jargon, they were pro-
testing Ronald Reagan using
Falwell to advance his political
standing, as stated in the arti-
cle.

The letter from Mr. Dwyer
quotes a passage from the
Republican platform about
women. He also states how he
feels about the ERA. It is very
presumptuous of Mr. Dwyer to
think the women who par-
ticipated in the protest are not
aware of the facts. Mr. Dwyer
refers to his 19-year-old sister
having to register for the draft
if the ERA is passed. Frankly, I
don’t see what his sister has to
do with either article.

Mr. Dwyer says: “I was in
Detroit. Let me explain it to
you.” I find this holier-than-
thou attitude condescending,
and again Mr. Dwyer’s
presence in Detroit has nothing
to do with how some Sweet
Briar women feel about the
ERA.

Does he honestly feel that be-
ing at the Republican Conven-
tion gives him better insights to
political ideals?

magazines and newspapers also
give an accurate account of
representing issues to those
who are unable to attend con-
ventions. The point of a

facts, not to dictate opinions.
Obviously Mr. Dwyer has dif-
ficulty in discerning between

. the two.

In closing, Mr. Dwyer ques-
tions: “Isn’t attending a school
which excludes’ men
discriminating against them?”
and adds he believes that Sweet
Briar and W&L should stay
single sex — another non se-
quitur vis-a-vis the ten women
who expressed their opinion in a
quiet demonstration.

In any case, the article on Oc-
tober 9 was a news article and it
is not my place to put my opi-
nion in what was a factual ac-
count of an event that related to
the Sweet Briar campus.
Freedom of speech and
freedom of the press are na-
tional laws, and I am “‘surpris-
ed”’ that Mr. Dwyer is ‘‘surpris-
ed” by an opinion that differs
from his norm. I suggest that
Mr. Dwyer explore the realms
outside of Lexington more often
and see that there are a myriad
of people expressing various
different views.

The Sweet Briar News will
continue to report the news
without any judgmental over-
tones, and Sweet Briar women
will continue to exercise their
rights as free thinking in-
dividuals.

Response To Response

Dear Editor:

John Vlohoplus’s critique

about voting in the 10/23/80
Ring-tum Phi rang harmlessly
hollow, but unfortunately, so do
the heads of many who would
read him and be misled by his
superficial ‘‘analysis.”’

The democratic process in
itself is impotent and irrelevant
to questions of political ethics.
Democratic process is no more
than one particular mechanism
for selecting employees to
carry out the principles upon

, which a government is based,

and it is upon these principles
which that government must be
judged.

The principles of the US.
government were originally
contained in its Constitution,
but it is clear from the actions
of that government that its Con-
stitution has long ago been
spurned and is paid only the
most nominal lipservice. Every
major concept therein has been
distorted (i.e. rights, freedom,
etc.), and every key sentence
has been stretched in supposed
meaning beyond the point of
recognizability. This can be
most clearly seen in the opi-
nions of the very judges who
were appointed to protect the
sanctity- of this phenomenal
work of legal science and
political philosophy. Even the
most basic tenants of legal due
process have been subverted.
The principle that a man is in-
nocent until proven guilty, with
the burden of proof falling
always on the state has been

clearly violated by the nature of

antitrust laws, trials and legal
guidelines. Note, also, that the
Supreme Court has recently
upheld the principle that a
whole industry can be held
liable for the malpractices of
one firm. This is an outrage and
in flagrant disregard of justice.

A democracy without the
foundation of a clear and intran-
sigently respected set of
political and legal principles to
define and delimit the nature
and scope of its actions is reduc-
ed to no more than arbitrary
gang-rule. Such a government
is a massive headless monster,
left free to run amuck through a
society, trampling the lives,
freedom and property of
countless human beings. In this
case, a democracy is no less
totalitarian than a dictatorship,
with the exception that the
despot there is clearly responsi-
ble for any _ injustice
perpetrated; he has no means
to bury that responsibility and
cower behind a maze of com-
mittees, votes, and
bureaucratic blind alleys as
does despot in a democracy. ‘‘A
commitment to the democratic
process,’’ along is, morally, a
null concept; and such policy is
not to be left to the arbitrary
power of employees, but is to be
outlined in an inviolate code of
principles such as the U.S. Con-
stitution.

I repeat from my previous
analysis. When any government
adopts a set of principles (even
if blindly, by default) which
allows any one, including the
government itself, to violate in-
dividual rights with impunity;
then that government deserves
the type of condemnation ra-
tional beings have for any
criminal, only multiplied by the
several orders of magnitude by
which the scope of such institu-
tionalized crime outsizes the
violations of the criminal.

To vote in a democratic pro-
cess, is only to participate in the
hiring of civil employees, and it
presupposes that the principles
which control those employees
are clearly presented, moral
and upheld with ruthless
justice. If this is not the case,
the vote is, indeed, the sanction
of the victim,

Stevenson

E.C. Sets Eleven Proposals

(continued from page 1)

arose at the end of the year.

‘The increase basically pro-
vides for any disaster at the end
of the year,’’ Willis said.

Eric Myers expressed con-
cern whether it was necessary
to increase the fund by $1500
and asked if it might be better
to instead allocate a percentage
of student taxes in order to in-
crease the fund.

But Willis said it is easier for
the committee to increase the
reserve by appropriating
money directly from the EC and
the proposal passed unaminous-
ly.

Three amendments pertain-
ing to the Publications Board
were accepted by the commit-
tee. Proposal number 10 would
ease restrictions governing
membership on the board by
allowing students to serve on
the Pub Board.

The constitution now states
that the board ‘‘shall be com-
posed of all editors and business
managers, and all former
editors and business managers
still students.”

Two other amendments that
the committee proposes would
change the wording of Article 5,
Section G thus establishing the
EC’s “‘power of review of the
Publication Board ...”’. The con-

mittee’s power over the Pub

Board as appellate jurisdiction.
The final proposal would in-
crease the board’s reserve fund
form $2500 to $4000 and divert
all net profits from university
publications to the fund.

In other business, Willis
swore in the two new members
of the EC. Freshman represen-
tative Ben Hale was elected
over George Weatherly in last

week’s run-off and first-year
law representative Michael
Nogay defeated Ken Ter-
willeger.

The next EC meeting is at
6:30 p.m. on Monday. Student
security in Lexington and the
recent increase in violent crime
will be the main topic at the
meeting, which is open to all
students.
