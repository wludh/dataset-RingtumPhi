Washington and Lee University

Colvin Awarded
NATO Fellowship

Dr. Milton Colvin, professor
of politics at Washington and
Lee University, has received a
research fellowship from the
North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).

Colvin is one of only five
Americans receiving NATO

grants. There were 25
fellowships awarded world-
wide.

Announcement of the
fellowship was made by Dr.
Joseph M.A.H. Luns, secretary-
general of NATO.

The aim of

the NATO

  

Dr. Milton Colvin
Research Fellowships is to pro-
mote research leading to
publication of studies which ex-
amine aspects of common in-
terests, traditions, and outlook
of the 15 nations that belong to
the NATO alliance.

Each NATO Fellow receives
a grant to support his study,
which must be undertaken in a
NATO country other than the
Fellow’s home country.

Colvin will conduct his

 

research in Germany. His topic
is ‘“The Pursuit of Detente in
East-West Relations: The Im-
pact of ‘Finlandisation’ on the
Young in Germany.” According
to Colvin, ‘‘Finlandisation’”’ is
the growing movement among
German youth to take a neutral
stance for Germany outside the
NATO alliance, thus giving the
country more flexibility in
East-West relations. Colvin will
travel throughout Germany and
will work in several cities, in-
cluding Berlin, Hamburg,
Heidelburg, Munich, Stuttgart,
and Cologne.

A graduate of Yale University
with a Ph.D. from the Universi-
ty of Heidelberg (Germany),
Colvin has been a member of
the Washington and Lee faculty
since 1961. He taught previously
at the University of Montana,
Vanderbilt University, and the
University of Chicago. He has
held visiting professorships or
research fellowships at the Na-
tional War College, the Univer-
sity of Vienna (Austria), and
Oxford University.

Colvin has contributed ar-
ticles or monographs to the
‘Yale Review,”’ the ‘‘American
Journal of Sociology,’’
‘Military Review,’’ and
“Smithsonian Studies.’’ He has
been a member of several
boards, commissions, and
organizations, among them the
Yale Alumni Board, the Yale
Scholarship Committee, the
Virginia Wilderness Commit-
tee, the Sierra Club, and the
American Political Science
Association.

Ex-Criminal Enthralls Audience

by Scott Mason

He’s been called The Great Imposter, The
Skywayman. He's served as an airline pilot, a doc-
tor, a lawyer, and a professor all between the ages
of 16 and 21. He’s forged phony checks in over 26
countries and became a millionaire by the time he
was 19. His name is Frank W. Abagnale, Jr., alias
Frank Williams, alias Robert Conrad, alias Frank
Adams, alias Robert Monjo, and is, almost
without question, the greatest con man ever.

The phenomenal story of Frank Abagnale was
revealed last night to a captivated audience in Lee
Chapel. Born in Westchester County, New York,
Abagnale left home at the age of 16 and began his
fascinating career as a con man. With a genius
1.Q. of 140 and having a photographic memory,
Abagnale became a Pan American airline pilot at
the age of only 16. In a clever, swindling story,
Abagnale served for two years as a pilot, flying
over three million miles for free while cashing
phony checks at airport, ticket counters nation-
wide.

 

Frank W. Abagnale, Jr.

At 18 years of age Abagnaie moved to Atlanta,
Georgia where he posed as a doctor. By the time
he left Atlanta he had served as a distinguished
chief resident of one of the city’s finest hospitals
while possessing no medical background what-
soever.

Abagnale later became an assistant to the Loui-
siana District Attorney after having successfully
passed the bar exam, Only after he had served as
a professor of philosophy at Brigham-Young
University, had stolen thousands of dollars in
deposits from Boston’s Logan airport, and had
cashed hordes of Pan Am payroll checks did FBI
agents have a clue as to Abagnale’s identity.

Finally caught at the age of 21, Abagnale was
sent to serve in a French prison. In a barbaric ac-
count of his six month sentence in a five by five
cell, Abagnale suffered a tremendous physical
and mental deterioration as a result of total isola-
tion.

Sent to serve in Sweden and later a New York
prison, Abagnale repeatedly escaped from

(See ABAGNALE, page 8)

Aldridge received his B.S.
degree from the University of
Richmond and his M.Ed. from
the University of Virginia. He
joined the W&L faculty in 1969
and, in addition to his teaching
duties in the physical education
department, serves as W&L’s
head track coach and assistant
football coach.

Cline received his B.A.
degree from W&L in 1967 and
worked for five years in private
industry before earning both his
M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from
Oklahoma State University. He
has taught at Washington and
Lee since 1975. Cline has, at
various times, served as consul-
tant to the United States
Department of Agriculture, the
American Institute of Banking,
and the Futures Group.

Emmer is_ head __ lacrosse
coach and assistant athletic
director at W&L. A graduate of
Rutgers University with an
M.S. from Cortland State, he
has been named Coach of the
Year in lacrosse on _ three
separate occasions,.twice in the
College Division and _ once
(1974) in the University Divi-
sion. He joined the W&L faculty
in 1972.

Fralin has taught at W&L
since 1975 after teaching for
three years at Virginia Military
Institute. A Ph.D. graduate of
the University of North
Carolina, Fralin has presented
three papers at foreign
language conferences and is
currently working on a textbook
to be completed next year.

Grunewald joined the faculty
of W&L’s School of Law in 1976.
Prior to coming to W&L, he had
been associated with the
Washington, D.C., law firm of
Arent, Fox, Kintner, Plotkin

Fabulous FabulousT- hirds

Within the confines of the
music of the 80’s, the title of the
Fabulous Thunderbirds’ second
album is most assuredly a dou-
ble entendre. Their music is
“The Last Word.”’ As guitarist
Jimmie Vaughn puts it,
“Everything except for the
music is beside the point.”’

The Thunderbirds play
rhythm and blues, pure and
Review:

simple. They have been
together as the Fabulous
Thunderbirds for the past three
years. The story goes that Jim-
mie Vaughn was playing in a
bar in his home town of Austin,
when Kim Wilson asked if he
could sit in. Vaughn said ‘‘No”
but Wilson hopped up onstage
anyway and promptly blew the
harp player in the band off-

stage. That was that. At
Vaughn’s_ insistence, Wilson
packed his things and moved to
Austin.

Shortly thereafter, bassist
Keith Ferguson, who was work-
ing in a Mexican band, and
drummer Mike Buck joined up.
Corny as_ it sounds, the
chemistry was there. The

senior thesis production of
Bradley Alan Lewis, at the
Rockbridge Co. Courthouse,
Thursday at8 pm.

Inherit the Wind is a fic-

“Diamond Studs,”’ a musical
about the life of infamous bank
robber and folklore hero Jesse
James, will be presented by the
Washington and Lee University
Theatre on May 22-24 and May
27-29 at 8:00 P.M. in Lexington’s
Troubadour Theatre.

Directed by drama professor
Al Gordon, ‘Diamond Studs”
consists of scenes from Jesse’s
life, from the time he joins
“Quantrill’s Raiders” in the
Confederate Army through his
death.

Reservations are required,
and may be made by calling
463-9395 or 463-9111, extension

with the University, tickets are
$2.50 for adults and $1.50 for
students under 18.

fiance of a state law mandating
that the creation story and only
the story of creation be taught
in class. The prairie populist
and perennial presidential can-
didate William Jennings Bryan
took on the task of prosecuting
the hapless educator. Clarence
Darrow appeared for the
defense, and a cause celebre was’
launched in every paper in the
country.

Inherit the Wind follows the
trial in all its stages. Brad
Lewis’ adaptation, which in-
cludes only the court room
scenes, is a lot tighter than the

original play, which sows
almost as much wind as it
reaps

Reduced to these bare essen-
tials, the play becomes a debate
between the fundamentalist -
Brady (Bryan) and the agnostic !
Drummond (Darrow) on the
evolutionary theories of Charles
Darwin rather than on the law
itself. In the final analysis, the
question addressed is: ‘Is it con-
stitutional to think?’

The debate that attempts to
answer this fundamental pro-
blem turns on the right of the
majority, of Brady and his
followers, to prohibit a freedom
of expression that offends them,
that threatens their faith or
their prejudice: the tyranny of
the majority. It is, like Shaw, a
battle of words.

Consequently, it is imperative
that the lines flow, that no splut-
tering, no marble-mouthing oc-
cur. Sad to say, this was not the

case Wednesday night. Even
taking the opening night jitter
quota into account, Ralph
Frasca as Brady, Boy Orator of
the Platte, stammered and
splutter more than his righteous
indignation called for, and Todd
‘Minks’ Smith ran a close se-
cond as Henry Drummond. The
rest of the cast was also prone
to the sporadic stumble, but not
more so than the opening night
atmosphere would excuse; and
besides, it is in the speeches of
the antagonists, Brady and
Drummond, that the real
showdown comes, and it is ther
that clarity is so essential. I
might add in passing that
Ginger McNeese was good as
gold in this, as in every,
respect: in one speech there
were five stammers, true, but
each of her stammers were call-
ed for in the script.

Aside from this important but
hardly paramount cavil, the
rest of the play went relatively
well. Frasca is, I must confess,
a little hard to believe as, the
Prophet from Nebraska,’ but
Todd Smith was letter-perfect
in his acidulated liberal
enlightenment, Mark Smith
was quite good as the cynical
journalist Hornbeck, and
Ginger McNeese was typically
professional as the
schoolmarm. The cast as a
whole, in fact, was quite
capable.

And oh, yes, the set was real
nice, courtesy of the Court. All
in all, not a bad thirty minutes.

Lacrosse Team Loses To UNC, 18-9,

Elimated From Tournament Consideration

When it rained, it poured.
Literally.

Midway through the third
quarter of Washington and
Lee’s lacrosse game last Sun-
day afternoon against the
University of North Carolina,
the overcast skies let loose with
a downpour. Up to that point,
the Generals were having
enough trouble with a shower of
shots from the number-two
ranked Tar Heels. An additional

shower simply added insult to -

the injury of an 18-9 loss.
“They were worthy of the

fashion by turning away 22 in
the form of saves. ‘‘22 saves is
simply a helluva good day,”’
Emmer said.

The first quarter ended in a
2-2 deadlock, after the hosts had
held leads of 1-0 and 2-1. In the
second period, though, North
Carolina broke loose to outscore
the visitors 9-2. The Tar Heels
then increased their advantage
by scoring the first three goals
of the third quarter.

‘‘We’re not upset with our ef-
fort. Our players performed
well from an offensive stand-

Wood paced the W&L offense by
netting three goals. Senior mid-
fielder Geoff Brent and
sophomore midfielder John
Doub added two each. Junior
defensemen Dave Nickels
received the team’s Player-of-
the-Game honors.

W&L now looks to shower
upon UMBC, which stands 7-3.
“They’ve made the transition
from Division II, where they
won the national lacrosse title
last spring, to Division I, and
made it well,’ commented Em-
mer on the Retrievers, who

“They have an abundant
amount of offensive ability in
the form of two strong midfield
units, and an attack as potent as
exists anywhere.’’ The offense
is keyed by a group of seniors:
midfielder Craig Linthicum, at-
tackman Jay Robertson, and
midfielder attackman Marty
Cloud.

Saturday’s contest will be the
fourth meeting of the teams.
The last battle, a 16-7 W&L deci-
sion, took place on March 25,
1972 on Wilson Field.

 

 

Set For
May 21

The Washington and Lee
University department of
athletics will hold its annual All-
Sports Awards Ceremony on
Thursday, May 21 at 5:00 on
Wilson Field.

The department will present
its three major honors: the
Preston R. Brown Memorial
Award to the most valuable
senior athlete; the Wink
Glasgow Spirit and Sports-
manship Award; and the
outstanding freshman award.
The department will also pre-
sent special recognition awards
to eight friends and supporters
of W&L athletics.

In addition to the depart-
ment’s presentations, each of
the University’s 13 varsity
sports will announce their in-
dividual award recipients.
Seniors who participated for
four years in a sport will
receive lifetime W&L athletic
event passes.

University Athletic Director
Bill McHenry will provide the
Ceremony’s welcome. Presi-

Washington and Lee senior
Gerry Barousse, from New
Orleans, La., will represent the
University at the seventh an-
nual NCAA Division III Golf
Championships, set for Tuesday
through Friday, May 19-22, in
Pinehurst, N:C.

Barousse will make his third
appearance in the NCAA event.
In 1977 he was a member of the
W&L team which placed
seventh in the competition, held
in Gambier, Ohio. In 1979, he
earned All-America honors by
placing in a tie for 11th place in-
dividually . while leading the
Generals to an 11th-place team
showing in the tournament, held
in Richmond, Va.

Barousse served as _ co-
captain with junior Bill Alfano
for this spring’s W&L team,
which finished with a perfect
12-0 record under head coach
Buck Leslie. Despite the team’s

undefeated season, the NCAA
selection committee did not in-
vite the Generals to participate
in the Division III champion-
ships.

Barousse paced the team in

Leslie Has High Hopes
For Golf Team Next Year

by Scott Mason

During the course of roughly
two months, the Washington
and Lee golf team has put
together a perfect 12-0 record
under the helm of coach Buck
Leslie and captains Gerry
Barousse and Bill Alfano. ‘‘We
met a couple of our goals,”
remarked Leslie, somewhat
disappointed that the team was
not selected to compete in nhe
NCAA Division III Champion-
in Greensboro, North

Carolina. Team leader and
senior co-captain Gerry
Barousse was, however, chosen
to represent W&L as an in-
dividual player. The four day
tournament begins Tuesday,
May 19.

The key to the Generals’ suc-
cess, it seems, rested in the
depth and balance among the
team players. In addition to
Alfano and Barousse, Steve
Everett, Del Agnew, Jim
Kaplan, and Bruce Blythe all

contributed to the team’s
undefeated season.
Although the loss of

graduating seniors Barousse
and Everett may somewhat

hinder the Generals, next
year’s team, nonetheless,
“looks fairly strong,’ says

Leslie. Based upon incoming
freshmen, the team can only
hope for a season as equally
successful as this year’s has
proven.

 

 

Soccer Team Looks Ahead

by John M. Cleghorn

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team will complete their
spring practice this week and
show great promise for the up-
coming season. What was one of
the campus’ strongest teams
this year has developed and
matured to pose even more of a
threat next year.

The team started the prac-
tices May fourth and will wind

them up this week. The practice
is not one of strenuous work

or strict conditioning but rather
one that gives coach Rolf Piran-
ian a chance to start moulding
and adjusting his players for
next fall. ‘‘The spring isn’t in-
tended to get players in shape
but to evaluate their different
skills at different positions,”’
remarks Piranian. The players
did drills and scrimmaged in
the afternoon sessions which in-
cluded a game against an alum-
ni team last Saturday. The
Generals beat the alumni early
3-0 in a game that gave them a

Netmen Lose

To Va. Tech

by Dale Park

Last Friday, the Washington
and Lee varsity tennis team
dropped its final match of the
season, losing a 9-0 home deci-
sion to Virginia Tech.

Freshman Charles Kalocsay
was the only bright spot in W&L
singles competition. Kalocsay
captured the first set 7-6 (5-3),
yet went quietly after that, 6-0,
6-1.

All three doubles matches
were hard fought. Senior co-
captains Doug Gaker and Pete

At second doubles, junior Wes

team of Kalocsay and Scott Ber-

chance to get used to their
teammates.

The Generals of 1980
registered a 9-4 mark missing
an NCAA bid by virtually one
game. The team only graduates
five playing seniors and returns
the bulk -of its talent in
freshmen and sophomores. The
largest losses, coach Piranian
comments, will be in the
goalkeeper and the center mid-
fielder positions. Keeper Kevin
Carney and midfielder Brian
Williams leave the Generals but
their places will be aptly filled
by Ben Muskin and Curt Mant-
zer.

W&L will face a_ tougher
schedule next year adding the
challenge of the University of
Richmond and the University of
Virginia. Messiah College and
Haverford College are two
strong division three teams that
will also be added. ‘“‘It’s a
tougher schedule,” says Rolf,
‘but it gives us a better chance
in the NCAA’s because we
knock heads with real division
three powerhouses.’

Cuts will be made this spring
to reduce the squad to 22 and
final cuts will leave the roster at
20 next fall. The Generals will
open their schedule the 16th of
September against Mary Wash-
ington after a short ten days of
preparation. ‘‘We’re hoping to
have a good group of freshmen
next year,’ commented coach
Piranian, ‘‘It’s possible that one
or two might be able to help us
out on the varsity.’’ Two former
players will also return next
year, Billy Brown and Joe Or-
dinez, who both started for the
Generals before taking off a
year. “That's a real positive
note for us to have that ex-

perience coming _ back,”’
remarked Piranian.
‘We have more talent on

campus now than any other
time that I have been here,”
fifth year head coach Piranian
states. “I am very optimistic
that this will be a team that the
school can be proud of.”

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Better Late
Than Never

During the past week, the Executive Committee
has held three long meetings in an effort to revise and
update the White Book, the most important set of
rules governing W&L students. Although it is a
monumental task, the committee’s efforts have been
outstanding. The overhauling and fine tuning that
needed to be done years ago on the Honor System is
finally getting done.

All the revisions in the ‘‘new’’ White Book are still
subject to final Executive Committee approval, but
there is little doubt that all will get the necessary two-
thirds vote when the time comes. These changes, first
proposed by a subcommittee of university ad-
ministrators and EC members, have in the past week
faced even closer scrutiny by the committee.

Some of the changes are simple corrections in
grammar, replacing words like ‘‘feel’’ with ‘‘thinks.”’
But some of the revisions are significant, including
replacing the old book with two new ones. The first of
these new books outlines the basic philosophy and en-
forcement of the Honor System, and the second book
details procedural matters and the rights of the ac-
cused. The EC believes two books will appeal more to
incoming freshmen and prospective students, and the
committee is right.

The only disturbing aspect of the committee’s ef-
forts has nothing to do with any of the proposed
changes, but that the committee waited too long
before discussing them. Six members were absent
from the last meeting and not once has the entire
committee been present at any one of the meetings.
Law representatives Mike Nogay and Jeff Edwards
are taking final exams, and the senior EC members
are busy with post-graduate plans. Input is needed
from all 12 members sitting around the table at the
same time, but unfortunately they all cannot get
together.

Progress has been made however, and final action
on the revisions is not far down the road. The EC
should be commended for tackling this issue. In the
future, the 1980-81 Executive Committee will best be
remembered for its work on the White Book, which
was better late than never.

Academic Notice

The Committee on the current Spring Term.

Automatic Rule will meet at
10:30 a.m. on Tuesday, June 9,

The Committee will consider
for immediate reinstatement

1981. At that time the Commit-
tee will consider whether or not
to reinstate immediately the
following groups of students
who have fallen under the
Automatic Rule:

1. those students completing a
full academic year who failed to
meet the cumulative average
required of their class;

2. those students not com-
pleting a full academic year
who failed to meet the condi-
tions of Academic Probation re-
quired of them by the end of the

all students who fall under the
Automatic Rule. If any student
wishes to inform the Committee
of any extenuating cir-
cumstances, he may write a let-
ter to the Committee and
deliver it to the Office of the
Dean of the College before June
9.

A student who falls under the
Automatic Rule severs his con-
nection with the University. If
the Committee does not grant
him immediate reinstatement
(reinstatement is the exception
rather than the rule), he may

apply for reinstatement after a
minimum of one year. As soon
as possible after the Commit-
tee’s meeting, each student fall-
ing under the Automatic Rule
will receive a letter explaining
his status. His parents will
receive a copy of that letter.

ACADEMIC PROBATION

Any student who fails to
achieve the cumulative average
required for his class but who is
not subject to the Automatic
Rule in June because he does
not complete a full academic
year then will be on Academic
Probation for the Fall Term. He
and his parents will be notified
of his status.

(continued from page 3)

Thunderbirds began doing the
grueling rounds of one-night
stands around Texas. Word got
around quickly. It wasn’t long
before people like Bob Dylan,
Eric Clapton, Dickie Betts,
Delbert McClinton and Elvis
Costello were showing up at the
Thunderbirds’ gigs.

The group, in support of their
debut album, toured the U.S. for
three months, supporting the
likes of John Prine, and Asleep
at The Wheel. They recently
completed a highly touted Euro-
pean tour with Dave Edmunds
and Nick Lowe’s Rockpile.

When asked about influences,
Jimmie Vaughn shuffles his
feet, but finally admits to cut-
ting his teeth on the likes of T-
Bone Walker, Lightning
Hopkins, Magic Sam, and Fred-
die King. Questioned about his
style, Vaughn grows more in-
tense: “I don’t believe in the
concept of lead guitar....1 just
play guitar.’”’ Indeed, Jimmie
plays both the chords and the
melody — at the same time.

In Texas, Jimmie Vaughn
had been a teenage legend. At
age sixteen, he was headlining
with his high-powered lead
guitar stylings. He later
foresook the high energy and
volume, and returned to his

roots, that pure, unadulterated.

rhythm and blues guitar.

Kim Wilson says that he stole
something from every harp
player that he ever listened to,
though a primary influence was
George ‘Harmonica’ Smith,
one of the instrument’s unsung
heroes. Yet Kim’s style is his
own; he can make a six dollar

marine band sound like an en-
tire horn section.

The Fabulous Thunderbirds’
first album was on the Takoma
Label. What was in the grooves
was identical to what they’d
been doing on the bar circuit.
Now, with ‘“‘What’s the Word?”
they’re stretching out a bit. No,

Business Societies
Initiate Twelve

Several students, alumni, and
faculty members of Washington
and Lee University were in-
ducted into two honor societies,
Beta Gamma Sigma and
Omicron Delta Epsilon, during
ceremonies on the campus May
ts

Initiates into Beta Gamma
Sigma, which recognizes
outstanding achievement in the
study of business administra-
tion, were: W. David Jones,
assistant professor of ad-
ministration; Marshall A,
Clark, a senior from Memphis,
Tenn.; Stanley K. Doobin, a
senior from Rock Hill, N.Y.;
Brian J. Noonan, a junior from
Charlotte, N.Ci: = and. J.
Franklin Williams, a junior
from Danville, Va.

Initiates for Omicron Delta
Epsilon, which recognizes
outstanding achievement in
economics, were: Carl P.
Kaiser, assistant professor of
economics; and_ seniors
Lawrence G. Davis, of Wil-
mington, Del., Charles T. Ham-
mes of Boone’s Mill, Va., Ted
M. Kerr Jr. of Midland, Texas,
and Jerrell G. Nickerson oi
Hopewell, Va.

In addition, two alumni were
inductees into Omicron Delta
Epsilon. H. Reed Johnston, a
1928 graduate who is a founding
partner of Johnston & Lunger, a
New York brokerage firm, and
his son, William R. Johnston, a
1961 graduate who is chairman
of Agora Securities Co.

 

this isn’t a ‘‘new and different”’
Thunderbirds, just a little more
of their own material. And
there’s enough vintage rhythm
and blues here to keep the most
fanatical purist pacified —tunes
like ‘Juke Boy Bonner’s Run-
nin’ Shoes” and Lazy Lester’s
“Sugar Coated Love.’’ On ‘‘Last
Call for Alcohol,’’ Kim shows
his chromatic harp chops, and
with “Extra Jimmies,”’ you get
to hear Mr. Vaughn strut his
stuff. Then there’s ‘‘Los
Fabuloso Thunderbirds’: close
your eyes here and listen to the
sounds of Mexican radio.

  

Despite the air of good-timey
fun about it all, at the bottom
the Thunderbirds are the
quintessential ‘‘serious’’
musical journeymen. We’ !
leave the last word to Jimmie
Vaughn: ‘‘The best music —I’m
talkin’ about real hillbilly, sw-
ing, cajun, Tex-Mex, and of
course, the blues — has been
made by people who never
studied music. You don’t need
to analyze it or study it or talk
about it. You just know that it
makes you feel..." Vaughn
Stops to search for a phrase.
‘*...that it moves you.’’ Enough
said.

custody, and is the only man ever to have escaped
from the Atlanta Federal Penitentary.

Somewhat ironically, Abagnale now heads a
company aimed towards security and the preven-
tion of crime. The firm grosses over $10 million a
year and develops material used by over 17,000 in-
stitutions.

The long-running television series ‘It Takes A
Thief’ starring Robert Wagner is based on
Abagnale’s life. Abagnale has made numerous ap-
pearances on Johnny Carson’s The Tonight Show
and on M*A*S*H. “Catch Me If You Can,”
Abagnale’s remarkable autobiography, sold over

100,000 copies in the first 21 days of its publication
and has remained on the national bestseller list for
seven months. A motion picture portraying
Abagnale’s life is soon to be released with actors
Dustin Hoffman, Alan Alda, and Katherine Ross
all taking leading roles.

The life of Frank Abagnale is an utterly
fascinating tale. Yet, says Abagnale, his career as
a con man wasn’t worth it. Now at the age of 33, he
looks back on his youth with some remorse. ‘‘I’ll
never know what it’s like to be 16,’ remarks
Abagnale. ‘‘Life is a very beautiful thing, but life
is very short. Please don’t grow up too fast.
Everyone has the right to his youth.”
