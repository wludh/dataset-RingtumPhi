Black Emphasis Month at
Washington and Lee University
is focusing this year on a topic
unique for a mostly white, all-
male college: ‘“‘Black Women in
the Eighties.”

W&L’s Student Association
for Black Unity (SABU) is
presenting a month-long series
of events emphasizing the
outlooks and accomplishments
of black women in American
ociety. Three of the five
scheduled presentations have
lready occurred, featuring
lack women professionals in
he fields of law, religion,
ducation and the arts.

The speakers, according to in-
formation released by SABU,
address a number of issues
“centering around the goals
and aspirations of the black
woman in the upcoming
decade.’’ All events are open to

Experiences
Maintenance ~

Difficulties

by Tom Baker
Despite operating in what

most students think is a suc-
cessful manner, the University

Library has run into problems
with book inventory and
maintenance since it opened 27
months ago.

Maurice Leach, the Head
Librarian, stated there is a
problem with students who in-
advertently or deliberately take
books from the library without
checking them out. It is easy for
students to walk out with books,
according to Leach, because the
university uses no guards at the
library’s main door. Leach also
said there is much concern at
this time of the year, mainly
because research materials are
in high demand.

Leach stressed the mutual
trust that exists between the
library staff and the student
body, According to Leach, the
library must maintain a “we
trust you and you have to trust
us’’ attitude if the valuable yet
fragile relationship between the
library staff and the student
body is to continue. Library of-
ficials do not want to discon-
tinue the honor system by using

NUMBER 22

EC Receives Petitions;
Four To Seek Reelection

by W. Cope Moyers

Four incumbents are among
the 24 candidates running for
positions on next year’s Ex-
ecutive Committee, according
to petitions filed at Monday
night’s EC meeting.

Junior Tripp Brower,
sophomores Frank Smith and
Peter Baumgaertner, and
freshman Ben Hale are all seek-
ing re-election to their positions
on the next Executive Commit-
tee, which will be headed by
junior EC member Eric Myers.
Myers was elected president of
the student body in last week’s
‘‘Big Three” elections.

Four other candidates are
running against Brower for the
two positions on the committee
from the senior class. They in-
clude Bob- Bergmann, Ken

Lang, Colt Puryear, and Jim

ers for a ground ball during Sunday's 17-10 victory over the :

For junior class EC represen-
tative, six students are seeking
to unseat committee members
Smith and Baumgaertner, in-
cluding Kraig Aramantrout,
SAB co-chairman Pryse Elam,
Danny Fetterman. Randall
Jacoby, Jack Sharman and
John Vlahoplus.

The position with the largest
number of candidates is

sophomore EC representative, .

where Hale and nine others are
running for the two positions.
Todd Barstow, Eric Campbell,
Zandy Campbell, Curtis Cowan,
Jack Dent, Louis Jehl, Ted Mc-
Quiston, Markham Pyle,
Leighton Stradtman and
George Weatherly are all can-
didates.

At the Monday meeting, the
EC agreed to limit candidate

Lax Team Wins Opener, 17-10

The Washington and Lee

lacrosse team opened its season

with a come-from-behind 17-10
win over the University of New

Hampshire this past Sunday,
March 15. The Generals will

travel to Raleigh, N.C., Satur-

day to face North Carolina
State. W&L is undefeated in its
six previous contests with the
Wolfpack, who sport a 2-1
season record.

“This season’s N.C. State
team is similar to previous ones
in that it has an explosive of-
fense and tremendous

stickhandlers,’’ begins ninth-

year W&L head coach Jack Em-
mer, whose team earned a 13-11

win over State last season in a
game played in Buena Vista,
Va. ‘‘They have good speed, a
good transition game, and ex-
ploit the unsettled situations
well.

“They do, however, give up
some goals, and if we can con-
trol the ball, we can get those
goals.”’

Scoring goals is exactly what
the Generals did during the se-
cond quarter against New
Hampshire. Specifically, W&L
got seven consecutive goals
over an eight-minute span to
turn a 6-4 UNH lead into an 11-6
advantage. Then, following a
Wildcat tally which made the

score 11-7 at halftime, the
Generals put the game out of
reach by scoring the first five

and only five goals fo the third —

period.

‘‘When we were down, we
talked about keeping our poise,
executing our offense,’’ Emmer
explained. ‘‘Then we wore them
down by scoring 12 of the
game’s 13 goals during the se-
cond and third periods.

‘‘T was pleased with our well-
balanced attack,’’ the coach
continued, pointing out that
twelve Generals scored in the
game. “With this many people
getting a hand in the scoring, it
makes us a tough team to

Each candidate is allowed 15
posters and one banner, and can
only display them on the main
campus.

The committee also agreed
that candidates for sophomore
EC representative, class presi-
dent, and vice-president are
allowed to place posters only in
the freshman dorms and in
Evans Dining Hall.

Besides the 24 candidates for
the six EC positions, an addi-
tional 25 students are running
for various other class offices.

Four people have announced
their candidacy for senior class
president, including Jedd Dunn,
Scott Howell, Bill Leachman
and Doug Sheldon. With only
John Pakula running for senior
class vice-president of the
Sciences.

Del Agnew, Barry Dunn and

Bouton Explains Controversial Baseball Career

by Ralph Frasca
“The major league baseball
owners want to put a lid on
player salaries before the real
money comes in.”

The speaker was Jim Bouton,
former major league pitcher
and author of the controversial
best-seller, ‘‘Ball Four,’ ex-
pounding on the current conflict
between team owners and
players, which may result in a
baseball strike this year.

Bouton spoke at Washington
& Lee University Thursday
night, telling hilarious stories
which kept the audience
laughing before discussing the
rampant greed of owners,
player salaries and the virtual
deification of athletes.

One of his favorite subjects
during the evening regarded the
prospect of a Cable Television
deal, which, in Bouton’s view,
would provide hundreds of
millions of dollars in revenue
for baseball. Revenue which the
players invariably would de-
mand a large part of.

“The owners are trying to
prevent the players from hav-
ing access to that money. I don’t
believe that the owners or the
players are entitled to it. I
believe the fans should own the
teams,’ the adamant Bouton
argued.

Bouton’s plans?

‘At the next Mayor’s Conven-
tion, the mayors should go to
the Cable TV networks and of-
fer to field high-calibre profes-
sional teams that would soon be
major league in quality for
$10.00 per subscribed
home...fairly inexpensive for a
‘‘People’s League!”’

“There must be 5 million
homes that have Cable TV.

Generals’ baseball coach Craig Jones.

‘That would be 50 million,

which is as much as baseball
makes from regular network
television right now.

“To form the league, just
sign minor league players, col-
lege players, and draft choices.
There would be no competition
with the major leagues,
because the owners would be
kicked out of the stadiums that
they don’t own. If George Stein-
brenner wants to run the
Yankees, make him build his
own stadium. Why should he
use a stadium that belongs to
the taxpayers?”

Bouton was not all business
though, as he told many
humorous stories about his
teammates. It was just such
storytelling in ‘“‘Ball Four’’ that
made him one of the most con-
troversial figures ever to wear
a baseball uniform.

“fT was in spring training
camp with the Yankees in 1962,
trying to make the team. We
were playing an_ exhibition
game against the Cardinals,
and went into extra innings. I
came in to pitch in the 10th in-
ning, and threw 5 scoreless inn-
ings. In the 15th, my catcher,
John Blanchard, came out to
the mound and said, ‘What the

hell are you doing, kid? It’s get-,

ting late! Just let them hit the
ball!’ I said, ‘‘John, I’m trying
to make the team!’ To which he
replied, ‘Look, kid, you’re not
going to make the team.
Besides, I’ve got to play golf,
and Yogi’s got plans for dinner.
Just let them win so we can get
out of here!’ The Cards finally
scored off me in the 16th inning
when Blanchard started telling
the hitters what pitch was com-
ing.”’

Bouton did make the team
that year, though, and spent the
next six years with the
Yankees, winning 21 games in
1963. He was dealt to the Seattle
Pilots in 1969, the season he kept
a diary which eventually
became ‘‘Ball Four.”

 

‘‘T have to thank the Baseball
Commissioner (Bowie Kuhn)
for the success of the book,”
Bouton chuckled. ‘‘He called it
‘a terrible book for America!’
Naturally, people had to read it
to find out what was so terrible.

The book sold 200,000 hardcover
editions and over three million
paperback copies. I wrote a se-
quel to Ball Four, called ‘I’m
Glad You Didn’t Take It Per-
sonally,’ and I dedicated it to
the Commissioner. I felt it was
thedeast I could do for him.”’

Bouton wrote ‘‘Ball Four” as
a protest to the endless stream
of ‘“‘milk and cookies’’ sports
books, which painted
unrealistic pictures of athletes,
virtually deifying them. He also
lashed out at the media for
making unworthy athletes seem

-heroic. Bouton’s example of

such a player was Thurman
Munson, who was eulogized by
all branches of the media after
his death in 1979, in a plane
crash.

Bouton stated, ‘“‘To make him
into a great man is a distortion.
Roberto Clemente is my idea of
a real hero. He, like Munson,
died in a plane crash, but
Clemente’s plane was headed
for Nicaragua with medical
supplies for the earthquake vic-
tims. Unlike Munson, he did not

Schenecker, and Bill Thau are

president.

The EC discussed how it
might get enough students to
vote on the proposed amend-
ment change, which has failed
three times this year only
because the required number of
students did not vote.

The committee agreed to in-
clude the amendment on next
week’s ballots for the numerous
class offices, and also announc-
ed that although voting for class
officers will last one day,
balloting for the proposed
amendment will take place
through Wednesday.

At least half of the student
body must vote on the amend-
ment, as well as another that
would extend the tenure of of-
fice for EC members next year
from the day after
undergraduate commencement
to three weeks before.

This means that next year’s
Executive Committee will
assume its responsibilities dur-
ing the last three weeks of
spring term this year. EC presi-
dent Bob Willis said this amend-
ment is important, because it
makes the transition, especially
regarding spring honor trials,
easier for the next committee.

The EC also heard monthly
subcommittee reports from the
Ring-tum Phi and Cold Check.
The Phi reported that the cir-
culation problems have ap-
parently been resolved and that
it has about $6000 in remaining
funds for editions this year.

Mike Malesardi of the Cold
Check subcommittee reported
that the committee has about
$1500 in assets, and $282 was col-
lected from former students

Bogie Double Feature

The Maltese Falcon (1941) John Huston’s directorial debut, and
the first of many successful collaborations with Humphrey Bogart.
This is a first rate detective picture, from a novel by Dashiell Ham-
mett; done on a ‘“‘B’’-grade budget, it would open up a new world of
‘‘A”’ pictures for Bogart at Warner Brothers. Huston also wrote the
screenplay. Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Gladys
George and Ward Bond starred in the Hal Wallis production. To be

To Have and Have Not (1944) From the Hemingway novel,
although not entirely faithful to the plot, adapted for the screen
with the help of William Faulkner. Screen debut of Lauren Bacall,
age 19, who made the celluloid sizzle with her opening line,
‘Anybody got a match?”’ (Must be seen to be appreciated). This
got Bogey and Baby off to a successful co-starring career, on and

Why Jim

by Ralph Frasca

After almost two months of
interviewing coaches, it feels
good to resume banging out my
commentary column.

I did enjoy writing the inter-
view series on _ coaches,
however, and in fact spent three
of my four high school years in-
terviewing professional
athletes for a Michigan-based
sports magazine. Much of my
free time was devoted to dodg-
ing chemical plants in my
native New Jersey, searching
for former and current athletes
to interview for my column in
the twice-monthly — sports
periodical. I did have the
privilege of interviewing some
of baseball’s true stars, such as
Hank Aaron, Willie Wilson, Phil
Rizzuto, and Bobby Thomson,
but I searched in vain for one of
my heroes. Oh, I knew. he lived
near me, but I could never track
down Jim Bouton. Until last
week.

Bouton appeared at Lee
Chapel Thursday, and proceed-
ed to captivate his audience by
telling some outrageous stories
of baseball lockerroom antics.
His appearance was easily the
most successful of those spon-
sored by Contact this year, but
for me, that fact was obscured
by my realization of a longstan-
ding goal: To interview Jim
Bouton.

Bouton is a jack-of-all-trades
in a very real sense. A 20-game
winner with the Yankees in
1963, Bouton has also added the
titles of author, sportscaster,
television scriptwriter, actor,
talk-show host, and mentor to
his repertoire. However,
doubtless his greatest claim to
cocktail-party fame was his
book ‘‘Ball Four,’’ which
chronicled his on and off-field
experiences during the 1969
baseball season, when Bouton,
a Yankee castoff, found himself
with a lowly expansion team
called the Seattle Pilots.

Although I have developed an
appreciation for such literary
superstars as Hawthorne, Poe,
and Twain since the first time I
read ‘‘Ball Four,” the latter has
remained one of my all-time
favorite “works of literature.”
Alternately hilarious and pro-

vocative, raunchy ana
philosophical, “‘Ball Four”
revolutionized sports book

writing by drying up the stream
of “milk and cookies’’ sports
books and biographies.

I’m sure you all know what
genre of book I mean.
Remember roaming through
your elementary school library,
devouring such pulp as ‘The
Tom Seaver Story’’? I sure did,
and I swallowed all _ that
malarkey which sought to
define athletes, making them
appear’ unrealistically

wholesome and_ righteous.
There they were, pre-
senting themselves in print
as that cozy, understanding

older brother that you never

had.

James Alan Bouton read
those stories too, but once he got
to the major leagues, he found
out that our baseball card
heroes did not drink malts, nor
did they go to bed at midnight.
Instead, they boozed and stayed
up all hours of the night, just
like the rest of us.

Bouton decided to write a
book in protest to the ‘‘milk-
and-cookies’”’ syndrome which
long afflicted sports book
writing. He wanted to take
athletes down from their
pedestal and place them,
deservedly, on a level with
everyone else. Somehow,
athletes had been thought of as
demi-gods, and still are to a
large extent. However,
Bouton’s book struck a blow to
the ‘“‘milk-and-cookie”’ monster
which encouraged people to
seek heroes from a group of
men and women who possessed
physical superiority, but rarely
mental or moral superiority.
Bouton revealed that they are,
by and large, ordinary people in
an extraordinary setting (ma-
jor league baseball), which
makes them do strange things.

Needless to say, “Ball Four”’
enjoyed remarkable success. It
spent eight months as the best-
selling book in America, selling
over 200,000 hard cover and
3,000,000 paperback copies.
Well, as any devout capitalist
will tell you, the safest way to

Sports

make money is to copy that
which is successful.

They arrived in hordes. The
‘‘reveal-all’’ books suddenly ap-
peared in alarming quantities,
choking off the “I’m a good
boy”’ biographies on the store
shelves. Professing to reveal
startling secrets and super-
raunchy stories, these sorry ex-
cuses for ‘‘candid’’ books
sought to imitate ‘‘Ball Four.”
One daring book, written by ex-
Detroit Tiger backstop Bill
Freehan, even dared to exceed
the. prototype. The cover of
Freehan’s book boldly pro-
claimed, ‘‘Knocks ‘Ball Four’
into leftfield.’”’ Bouton com-
mented that Freehan’s book
“‘didn’t even hit ‘Ball Four’ for
a short pop-up.”’

Thus, devoted literature
students, we have two extremes
of sports books: the patronizing
‘“‘milk-and-cookies’”’ sagas, and
the ‘‘reveal-all’’ expositions
which ‘‘tear the cover off of pro-
fessional sports.”’ Either way,
you have worthless, distorted
pulp, with “Ball Four”’ standing
above it all.

Having read it three times
and looking forward to a fourth
reading this summer, I would
recommend to the minority who
have not read the book to par-
take of it at the earliest possible
convenience, possibly once you
have won this round of the
“textbook war.’’ Although,
strangely enough, the W&L
library does not have the book,
area bookstores are sure to ac-
comodate.

Now if only I could interview

Generals Place Five

by Phil Murray
In every sport, college
athletes work all season for a
chance to test themselves in
competition against the best in
the nation. For college swim-
mers, that means the NCAA

~ Championships.

On March 19, five Washington
and Lee swimmers will travel
to Oberlin College in Oberlin,
Ohio for the NCAA Division III
Championships.

Junior co-captain Mike Ber-
not has qualified to compete in
three individual events — the
50-yard free-style (21.88), 100-
yard free-style (47.69), and 200-
yard free-style (1:45.74) And as
a part of the 400-yard free relay
team.

Bernot registered his qualify-
ing time in the 100-yard free-
style as the lead relay man for
the free relay team whose quali-
fying time of 3:15.91. The team
is composed of Bernot, junior
co-captain Herb Gresens, and
freshmen Jeff Gee and Gary

In NCAA Championship

Meyer. :

Coach Page Remillard
believes the team has a good
chance to make All-American,
but will have to swim a 3:13 or
3:14 to achieve that goal.

Freshman sensation Tim
Rock will also make the trip.
Rock has qualified in the 500-
yard free-style (4:47.64) and
1650-yard free-style (16:17.27)
events.

Rob Crawford, who broke
three school records at the UNC
— Wilmington Invitational,
qualified in those three events,
but chose not to compete.

Looking back on the season,
Coach Remillard was pleased
and optimistic for the future.
Several swimmers, including
Bernot, Gee, Meyer, and Rock,
had lifetime best times in their
specialty events.

‘“‘We found out how good we
could be this year,” said
Remillard. ‘Next year we will .
set higher goals and hope for
more success.”

Track Team Loses To Davidson

 

Billy Mooris and R.J. Skaggs in the 400-meter race.

by John Harrison

The W&L track and field
team lost a lead which it had
held for the majority of last
Saturday’s meet with Davidson,
and went on to drop an 89-80
decision. Mary Washington had
four entries, but failed to score.

M.W. did prove to be a factor
in the meet, nonetheless. The
Generals had a chance to come
out with a tie, but were denied
the opportunity because M.W.
had no one to compete in the
last event, the pole vault.
Because this was a tri-meet,
every team had to have at least
one participant in every event;
thus, the pole vault was cancell-
ed and the Generals lost their
opening meet.

Several Generals had strong
showings, most of which came
in the first half of the meet.
Freshman Kevin Kadesky plac-
ed second in both the 100 and
200-meter races; co-captains
R.J. Scaggs and Billy Morris
came in first in the 400-meter
and 200-meter respectively;

Charlie Alcorn placed second in
the discus and third in the shot
put; Alan Armitage finished
first in the intermediate
hurdles; Mark Shaver (159’8’’)
and Mike Fogarty (157’9’’) pac-
ed the Generals in the javelin;
freshman Paul Chapman was
second in the 800-meter; and
Russ Rector placed second in
the high jump.

Coach Norris Aldridge wasn’t
totally displeased with the
team’s effort, even though it
collected only two points in the —
last four events, while Davidson
captured 29 tallies.

The Generals will not par-
ticipate in the scheduled Rich-
mond relays on Saturday due to
cancellation. Coach Aldridge
believes his team would have
benefited from going up against
the scheduled field of strong
Division I schools.

The Generals’ next meet is on
Friday, March 27 at 3:00 p.m.
Emory and Henry and Newport
News will provide the opposi-
tion.
Tennis Team Splits 4 Matches

by Dale Park
Led by senior co-captains
Doug Gaker and Pete Lovell,
the Washington and Lee varsity
tennis team split 2-2 in its first
four outings of the 1981 spring
season.

The Generals opened up their
season back on March 8 with a

’ solid 6-3 win over the University
of Charleston, with W&L seeing
the top four singles flights.
Lovell, who earned All-America
honors last spring by advancing
to the semifinals of the NCAA

 
   

Division III Championships,
outlasted his first singles oppo-
nent, winning 6-3, 7-6 (5-3),
while Gaker cruised past his
man at the second flight, 6-3,
6-3. Sophomore Steve Denny, at
the third position, walloped his
oponent 6-0, 6-0, and freshman
Scott Berman went the distance

in his 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 victory at the
fourth spot.

In doubles, Lovell and Gaker
teamed up for a 6-2, 6-0 win at

the number-one flight, while
Berman teamed with classmate

Charles Kalocsay at the third
spot for a 7-5, 6-3 triumph.

On March 13, the netmen
made it two in a row by narrow-
ly beating West Chester State,
5-4. This time the Generals
swept the top three singles
flights, as Lovell, Gaker and
Denny won easily. In doubles,

Steve Denny and Wes Yonge teamed up to top West Chester State.

Lovell and Gaker swept to a 6-1,
6-1 victory, while Yonge and
Denny teamed up for a 7-5, 6-4
win at the second flight.

The following day, however,
W&L ran up. against a tough-
ened University of Rochester
team. The Generals managed to
win only one singles and one

doubles position as they bowed
to the Yellowjackets, 7-2. Gaker
squeezed out his victory at
second singles, 7-6 (5-4), 7-6
(5-3). Later, Gaker combined
with Lovell for an easy 6-3, 6-2
win at the first doubles position.

In their first ODAC match of
the year the Generals dropped a
close 5-4 decision to Lynchburg
on March 16. W&L took number
two and three singles positions;

“Gaker remained undefeated

with a 1-6, 6-4, 6-4 comeback vic-
tory, while Denny won a narrow
7-6 (5-0), 74 (5-2) match. In

PO Stacia

doubles, Gaker and Lovell ran
their record to 4-0 at first
doubles with a 6-3, 6-2 win, while
the team of Denny and Yonge
finished off their second-flight
opponents, 6-3, 7-5.

The W&L netmen will host
California State College tomor-
row at 2:00 p.m.

Golf Team Tops Rochester

final score of 420 to 436.

Led by junior co-captain Bill
Alfano and senior co-captain
Gerry Barousse, it appears
quite evidence that coach Buck
Leslie has put together a strong
team, one that can look forward
to a promising season. Leslie
stated that he was concerned

Lexington (703) 463-7222

(703)463-7222

 

about the class distribution of
players within the line-up, and
emphasized that good team
balance was essential if the
Generals were to have any
hopes of improving last year’s
mark. Obviously, Leslie’s
strategy paid off on Friday.
What: the squad hopes to strive
for now and during the course of
the season is the improvement
of their stroke average, and
this, most likely, will gradually
develop as the season pro-
gresses.

The team participated in a
two-day NCAA District III,
Division III tournament in
Greensboro, North Carolina
yesterday and today. The
Generals are competing with
ten other teams, most of which
are from North Carolina. Leslie
remarked that the tournament
“will help determine the
strength of the area’s Division
II] teams.’ Next Tuesday,
March 24, the Generals play
host to Bridgewater and
Shepherd Colleges.

Baseball Wins
First Three Games

The Washington and Lee
baseball team, which swept a
three-game series from West
Virginia Tech this past
weekend, will open its Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
schedule this weekend when the
Generals travel Friday after-
noon, March 20 to face defen-
ding ODAC champion Lynch-
burg College.

The conference encounters
will continue on Saturday,
March 21 when Emory & Henry
College visits W&L for a 1:00
p.m. doubleheader, and on
Tuesday, March 24 when the
Generals travel to Randolph-
Macon College for another
doubleheader. The ODAC ac-
tion is preceeded by a Wednes-
day, March 18 contest at
Longwood College.

“This week marks the begin-
ning of some true challenges for
our players,” begins head
coach Craig Jones, whose
Generals’ own a 3-0 record by
virtue of the wins over Tech.
“And we feel that we're
prepared for them, on account
of the tough teams we faced
during our pre-season Florida
trip and on account of the con-
fidence we gained this past
weekend.”

W&L’s wins came by scores
of 14-1 on Friday, March 13, and
14-0, 17-0 in a Saturday, March
14 doubleheader. Junior
righthander David Randall
pitched the distance in Friday’s
contest, striking out eleven and

allowing five hits, all singles.
Junior righthander Jim
Brockelman took the win in
Saturday’s opener, classmate
and righthander Rich Hachen-
burg the victory in the nightcap
by pitching a no-hitter. Both
Saturday games were short-
ened from the normal seven in-
nings to five due to abnormally
windy conditions on Smith
Field.

In addition to the trio of
righthanded pitchers, other
W&L standouts during the
series were: sophomore Chris
Cavalline,who had seven hits in
ten trips to the plate; junior Jeff
Haggerty, who belted a pair of
home runs and collected five
RBI’s in Saturday’s second
game; senior Tom Coates and
junior Tripp Brower, who ‘‘per-
formed extremely well at cat-
cher’ according to Jones;
sophomore Jody Harris, who
“is getting comfortable at
shortstop” after starting in left
field last season; and freshman
David Warrenfeltz, who
“provided good baserunning
and strong infield defense,’’ ac-
cording to the coach.

The five upcoming ODAC
games are part of 14 conference
encounters for W&L as the team
seeks a first-ever appearance in
the conference tournament,
which will involve the top four
teams from the eight-team
regular season standings. The
tournament is set for April 25-26
at Lynchburg College.

defense.”’

Five Generals scored two
goals each: seniors Geoff Brent
and George Santos; junior Mike
Schuler, whose tallies came
during the seven-goal run; and
sophomores John Tunney,
Geoff Wood. Junior Rob
Staugaitis handed out a game-
high four assists while
sophomore Craig Albanese,
who controlled 11 of 16 faceoffs
and scored once, received W&L
player-of-the-game honors.

Saturday’s contest with N.C.
State will be a meeting of the
ninth- and tenth-ranked teams
in the first U.S. Intercollegiate

Lacrosse: Association coaches’
poll, which was announced
Monday. W&L stood ninth, get-
ting 62 votes, N.C. State tenth
with 52 votes.

‘‘We like to think we’ve got a
(NCAA) Tournament team here
at W&L, a veteran team which
deserves more than _ ninth
place,’ Emmer commented.
‘We had a fine 3-0 exhibition
season including a key win over
Mt. Washington and we ended
up fifth in last season’s final
USILA poll. We like to think
we’ll be improving in the rank-
ings.”’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Black Emphasis Month

For those of you who have not noticed that the
Student Association for Black Unity is once again
sponsoring Black Emphasis month, we would like to
bring this fact to your attention. The topic for the
month dedicated to blacks is Black Women in the
eighties. While the topic may seem far-fetched or
unusual for this last bastion of southern manhood, we
think it is an excellent topic for two reasons:

One is that many Washington and Lee students
have little or no understanding of blacks. The other is
that we really have little understanding that women
play a more significant role in society than road trips
may tend to suggest. There is something each of us
can gain from Black Emphasis month, whether we
simply go to the ball or attend the various lectures.
The topic serves as a thoughtful reminder that in just
a few short years or even months we will be back out
in the real world.

E.C. Campaigns

It’s that time of the year again. The lacrosse
season has started, the weather has ranged anywhere
from sub-tropic to sub-arctic, and many
otherwise invisible and silent students have crawled
out of the wood-work to run for the E.C. Don’t get us
wrong, we have nothing against students who want to
join the E.C., we only doubt the validity of some can-
didates. For example, can any concerned voter cast
his ballot for a candidate who claims that his main
function as an E.C. member will be to do as little as
possible?

There are certainly many aspects of the W&L com-
munity which can be lampooned. However, the effec-
tiveness of student government should not be one of
them. In voting for your E.C. representative, you are
directly influencing the quality of life at this schoo!
We certainly believe that this is nothing to joke about.

IVCF To Participate In Hunger Day

Dear Student Body:

We of the W&L community
are privileged in many ways
that most of us tend to take for
granted. I am referring to the
blessings of health, family,
education, economic security,
and abundant food each day.
The availability of food is so
basic and expected that most of
us do not consider the extreme
world hunger situation. Accor-
ding to the 1980 Presidential
Commission on World Hunger,
20 million persons are dying
yearly of hunger-related causes
in the world. This means that
over 50,000 people have per-
ished today because of this pro-
blem, not the nice quick clean
way as on television, but over a
slow gradual starvation process
of suffering, agony, and pain
until death occurs. This is
something that we here at W&L
are not in a position to com-
prehend. Can anyone?

According to Dr. Harvey
Conn of Westminister
Theological Seminary, for
every 1000 people in the world,
69 of them live in North
America. Yet these 69 people
consume two-thirds of the
world’s energy, one-seventh of
the world’s food, and have nine-
tenths of the world’s doctors. I
am not going to show you a pic-
ture of starving men, women,
and children beside a picture of
what each of us consumes (and
wastes) daily in food intake. I
have simply superficially
described a problem ap-
proaching crisis that is
catastrophic, growing, and,
W&L gentlemen, is going to in-
fluence our well-planned and
“secure’’ futures.

Can something be done about
the millions of starving people
in poor countries before the
most unparalleled suffering in
human history menaces our
planet? The obvious answer is
yes. People die of starvation
one at a time, and they can be
helped one at a time. We, in-

dividually and corporately, can
be of significant aid to the solu-
tion of the world hunger crisis
as we take the necessary
measures to combat this pro-
blem.

We of the Washington and Lee
Inter-Varsity Christian
Fellowship have designated
Wednesday, March 25 as World
Hunger Day on our campus. We
are asking all students and pro-
fessors, who would be willing, to
voluntarily skip a meal on this
day and to donate the cost of
that meal to the cause of world
hunger. Any individual’s par-
ticipation in this project is pure-

~, = a
iS age ghee Xs “ wo: i
Pee Oa a
ed ek a vee “

PY eae er eh Ree ee ©

ly voluntary. We have selected
a newly formed local organiza-
tion, the Community Pantry,
which is a part of the Concerned
Citizens of Lexington, to donate
half of the proceeds to. We have
also selected an international
organization, World Vision In-
ternational, for this world-wide
scope and low administrative
costs (15 percent) to donate the
other half of the proceeds to.

Mr. Darrell of Evans Dining
Hall has volunteered to donate
the raw food cost for everyone
who will give up the evening
meal on this day. We are also
encouraging the law school to

participate. We would like to
give each of the fraternity
houses an opportunity to par-
ticipate in the same way as
Evans Dining Hall if they so
desire. For those persons who
eat in Evans Dining Hall and in
fraternity houses who do not
wish to skip a meal but would be
willing to donate money, we will
provide money cans in the
fraternity houses and ground
campus where permission is
granted.

This project has been given
approval by the _ Inter-
fraternity houses and around
campus where permission is

      
 

participate in some tangible
way.

We would like to encourage
everyone to participate on
Wednesday, March 25, but more
even than this, to seriously con-
sider developing a lifestyle that
confronts rather than ignores
the present world food crisis.
Again, your participation, while
greatly appreciated, is volun-
tary.

Sincerely,
Frank Williams 82;
President
Inter-Varsity
Fellowship

Bouton was offered a job as a
sportscaster in New York, in
1970, and thus retired from
baseball. He spent six years as
a television sportscaster, where
his controversial mien got him
into more hot water. One of his
broadcasts was said to make
New York Giants’ head coach
Alex Webster, ‘‘look like a
dullard,’’ and the Giants took
Bouton’s employers to court.
Although the suit was eventual-
ly dismissed, Bouton was
branded a troublemaker, as he
had been when ‘‘Ball Four” was
published.

In 1978, the 39-year-old
Bouton attempted a major
league comeback ‘‘to find
myself,’ he reported. He, even-
tually pitched with the Atlanta
Braves after several trying
years in the minor leagues.

The personable Bouton still
looks as though he could hur! his
famous knuckle ball in the ma-
jor leagues, but he is occupied
with other things. He has just
written a new edition of ‘Ball
Four’, which includes a
chapter on what has become of
his old teammates.

He is also the inventor of ‘‘Big

{lakes which come in a pouch
made to look like tobacco.

in a letter to Dean White prior to
her lecture here, ‘‘has never ful-
ly accepted the responsibility
for conditions which exist
among the majority of Black
Americans. To a great degree,
white America thinks that it has
done good by us, that it has
tried, and that somehow,
despite failed efforts, it is now
time to pull back substantially
from those efforts.

‘“‘During my _ visit to
Washington and Lee (on
Wednesday), I hope to ac-
complish two things

simultaneously: One — to show,
demonstrate, how the ideas,
issues, concepts and feelings of
a writer can be translated into
fiction... Two — To express the
ongoing rage and bitterness
which Black people feel toward
whites; the aloofness with
which whites view Black
people.

“TI hope to share the beauty
and sweetness in Black people’s
lives, despite all that is life
threatening in that existence; to
examine, even if only in
shadowy form, the precept that

reconciliation and productive
partnership between white and
Black Americans is imperative
if we are to survive as a
nation.’

The substantial alseine’ vic- —

tory of Ronald Reagan, who
blacks voted overwhelmingly
against, has planted the seeds
of racial activism in this coun-
try largeiy absent during the
Carter administration. Any
black agenda for the 1980’s is
sure to include plans for over-
coming any obstacles the new
administration presents such as
its anti-busing stance and pro-
posed social program cuts.

Why, Dean White was asked,
was “‘black women”’ chosen as
a subject rather than another
topical aspect of black America
in the years ahead?

‘‘We examined the perspec-
tive of Washington and Lee as
an all-male institution,’ he
said. ‘‘We decided to give the
average student an opportunity
to look at the implications of
racism and sexism in society as
opposed to the more traditional
approach of racism in society.”’

Past speakers have included
the Rev. Jesse Jackson, come-
dian Dick Gregory and activist
Stoakley Carmichael.

Library Problems

guards.

One library procedure that
has been criticized by students
is the refusal of the library staff
to disclose the name of a stu-
dent who has checked out a
book that another student
needs. Leach said this pro-
cedure exists in order to ensure
the privacy of the student who
checks out the book and to avoid
“putting one student against
another for a_book.’’ Two
weekends after the book has
been checked out however, the
library staff will ask the student
to return it if another student
has made a request.

Leach also expressed his con-
cern over several problems the
library has experienced con-
cerning smoking and the casual
use of emergency doors. Leach
said that students using these
doors jeopardize the safety and
security of the library.

Leach also pointed out that
several smoking
areas which were installed at
the request of students. Leach
also noted that continued use of
the emrgency doors may affect
the operating hours of the
library. The University Library
currently is open 24 hours a day.

In the area of maintenance,

many students have voiced
complaints over the elevators’
lack of reliability. Jim Arthur,
Superintendant of Building and
Grounds, attributed the prob-
lem in part to the constant
pushing of buttons, which he
credits to ‘“‘human nature.” Ar-
thur said the pushing of buttons
wears out the elevators’’ con-
tacts, causing them to “go
down.”

According to Arthur, the
library’s elevators take a long
time to repair because the
maintenance crew at W&L is
not trained to repair elevators.
Elevator contractors in
Roanoke would likely take the
same time to repair a downed
elevator, so Arthur prefers to
have the W&L do the job.

Arthur also added that the
library’s elevators employ a
new kind of technology, which
can cause problems. Arthur
also said the library's elevators
are the most-used on campus
and are therefore susceptible to
breaking down. Arthur claimed
the -library’s elevators cost
three times more than any
other elevator on campus to
operate. The library itself has
one of the highest operating
costs on campus, according to
Arthur.
