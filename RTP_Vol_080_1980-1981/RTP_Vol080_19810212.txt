The number of local arrests
for breaking and entering and
larceny increased substantially
in 1980, according to a report by
Lexington Police Chief James
A. Kirby.

In a summary at the begin-
ning of the 21-page report, Kir-

    

by noted that the department in-
vestigated 54 break-ins and en-
tries last year, compared to 33
in 1979, an increase of 38 per-
cent. The number of reported
larcenies increased 26 percent.
Kirby said the amount of
goods stolen by breaking and
entering and larceny totaled

$76,661 and that his department
managed to recover $26,224 or
about one-third of the property
taken.

The number of juveniles
arrested in Lexington fell from
123 in 1979 to 100 last year. Ina
breakdown of figures, Kirby
called attention to what he con-

wo
Vi at

sidered “some of our most
serious crimes’: breaking and
entering (56 juveniles
charged); grand larceny (15
juveniles charged) ; and posses-
sion of drugs (1 juvenile
charged).

Kirby said some of the
juveniles brought to court were

repeat offenders.

The police chief said he took
pleasure in reporting that no
violent crimes ‘‘such as murder
or manslaughter’’ were
reported in 1980. Kirby did not
mention it in his summary, but
two instances of attempted

MD Superdance Raises
$22,000 In Pledges

by Steven Perry

For the third consecutive
year, Washington and Lee
University played host to a
dance marathon for Muscular
Dystrophy. An_ estimated
$22,000 was pledged to the M.D.
cause during the 30-hour Super-
dance.

150 dancers started the dance
marathon and 140 finished, an
increase of twenty finalists
from last year. Although less
money was pledged to the
benefit this year, Superdance
co-chairman Tripp Brower
believes that more of the money
will be collected.

Brower said that the help of 30
secretaries in compiling the
bills will result in a collecting

rate of over 90 percent, an in-

crease over last year’s 75 per-

cent.

In addition to the dancers,
more than 1,000 spectators
witnessed Superdance ’81 over
the course of the weekend.
Saturday night produced the
largest crowd, with over 700
people present.

As was promised, four
members of W&L’s administra-
tion fell victims to pie tosses:
Dean Atwood raised the most
money, with a winning bid of
$115. Ninety dollars was
pledged by Richard Drennen,
the remainder by Lexington
Mayor Charles Phillips.

Dr. Worth raised $85, and was
pegged by Jerry Darrell. Adlin
Goldstein offered $75 for the
chance to hit Dean Murphy, and

Chris Peacock paid $70 to nail
Ham Smith.

Bill Bourne won the grand
prize, a trip for two to Key
West, Florida. Bourne raised
the most money in pledges.

Mike Wyatt was the runner-
up, and received a free trip to
the Greenbriar. Wyatt was also
awarded the prize for the
largest cash donation.

For the first year, 22 hours of
the Superdance were filled with
live music. Hemby, master of
ceremonies of Superdance ’81,
said that the bands were quite
pleased with the crowds that
attended their performances.
Several of the bands were old
hands at doing benefit perfor-
mances.

John Barth Speaks
In Chapel Tonight

John Barth, widely acclaimed
as one of America’s best fiction
writers, will speak in Lee
Chapel on the Washington and
Lee University campus tonight
at8p.m.

Barth is a native of Cam-
bridge, Md., who received his
bachelor’s and _ master’s
degrees from Johns Hopkins
University and who is presently
professor of English and
creative writing at Johns
Hopkins.

A member of the National
Institute of Arts and Letters and

a fellow of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences,
Barth won a National Book
Award in fiction in 1973 for
‘‘Chimera.”’ Other Barth works
include his latest, ‘‘Letters,’’
and earlier works such as
“Giles Goat-Boy,” ‘‘The Sot-
Weed Factor,’’ and ‘‘The
Floating Opera.”’

Barth’s appearance at W&L
is sponsored by ‘‘Contact,’’ the
symposium organized jointly by
the Interfraternity Council and
the W&L Student Government.

Breeze has performed several
‘times at reduced rates. Bassett
later remarked that he enjoyed
helping the dancers achieve
their goal and his performance
was ample evidence of his
enthusiasm.

The remaining eight hours of
dancing was provided by

When asked if he was disap-
pointed by the lower amount of
monev pledged this year then in
previous years, Hemby stated
that the Superdance has sur-
passed its goal of $20,000.
Hemby noted that ‘‘any amount
of money we can raise for these
people is enough.”’

pledges are being forced to pay
$2,900 for a tree that they cut
down from a local resident’s
yard to use as a Christmas tree
in their fraternity house.

The pledges were first caught
by the Lexington Police Depart-
ment when the police, with the
help of University Proctor
Charles Murray, matched the
rings of the tree in the house
with the rings of the stump of
the 20-foot high Norwegian
Spruce. The rings were actually
matched in the police forensic
lab in Roanoke.

The local resident, Mr. James
G. Dunlap of 959 Thorn Hill
Road, reached an agreement
with an attorney, James W.
Osborne, whom the pledges
hired. The tree will be replaced

with the expenses paid for by
the pledges.

Usually, an incident of this
sort results in a felony theft
charge. According to
Commonwealth’s Attorney
John Read, his office maintains
a policy that, because the
pledges were able to reach an
agreement with Mr. Dunlap
over the replacement of the
tree, charges were not filed.

Mr. Dunlap also stated that
he was willing to reach an
agreement and not press
charges because he did not
want to see the pledges having
to face trial over the incident.

The Phi Kappa Sigma Frater-
nity was;“according to fraterni-
ty president Rob Brooke,
avoiding the situation and
allowing the pledges to work out
the situation on their own.

rape/sodomy were reported
last year for the first time since
1977, when one case was
reported.

Traffic accidents went down
by one, from 217 to 216. This
marks a continuing downward
trend since 1976, when the
figure was 247. Accident-related
property damage declined 15
percent to $22,248. Kirby ex-
plained that 11 percent of all
drivers in accidents had been
drinking.

The following violations
showed a marked increase over
the previous year; trespassing,
from 15 cases to 37; possession
of controlled drugs, from 7
cases to 15; drunk in public,
from 302 cases to 363; and
reckless driving, from 92 cases
to 104.

The number of persons
charged with drinking in public
decreased from 17 cases to six.
There were also declines in
some traffic violation
statistics: speeding tickets
went down to 174 from the 1979
figure of 295 and a high of 587 in
1977. Cases of parking in a
restricted zone went down from
783 cases to 768.

Although no mention was
made of it in the report, the
department faced some staffing
problems in 1980. The situation
was discussed at the last city
council meeting and in an inter-
view with City Manager John V.

Doane.

‘We had some _ turnover,

which I would not characterize
as unusual,”’ said Doane. ‘‘We
did have one continuous vacan-
cy for about six months.”
Doane said that the department
is now fully staffed.

Finally, the police chief

offered a list of services provid-
ed by the police in addition to
regular duties:

— During 1980 the depart-
ment checked citizens’ homes
while out of town for a period of
time. Checks are made random-
ly three times a week, involving
40 homes a day.

— Escorts are provided for
banks twice weekly when
transporting large amounts of
money to the bank or to the post
office for shipment.

— Doctors and nurses are
provided transportation, when
no other means is available,
when there is an emergency
situation at the hospital.

— Escorts are provided for
merchants as they make night
deposits after heavy shopping
days.

— Forty-two burglar alarms
from various businesses are in-
stalled at the police depart-
ment, keeping the dispatcher
constantly on the alert.

— The department assists
citizens (‘‘at least one call per
week’’) who have locked their
keys in their car.

 

— The department finger-

prints approximately 150 law
students, cadets and others for
various reasons.

— The department helps start

citizen’s cars late at night when
no mechanic is available ‘‘and
even looks for lost pets.”’

“We are glad to perform

these duties,’’ wrote Kirby. “I
feel good public relations be-
tween the community and the
police department are impor-
tant.”’

City Manager John Doane
said the report contains no sur-
prises. ‘‘It confirmed pretty
much what I’d been aware of,”
he said, ‘regarding trends in
criminal and non-criminal ac-
tivity. Of course I'm concerned
about the number of robberies,
breaking and enterings and
various juvenile problems. I
don’t think the statistics reflect
the relatively successful efforts
of the department in apprehen-
ding these perpetrators.

“I would characterize the
report as fairly routine infor-
mation, a useful analyzer of
trends and needs. I can’t
evaluate the effectiveness of the
department in terms of the
report alone, but their success
in dealing with major offenses
compares pretty favorably with
other city departments in the
state.”’

  

night's meeting.

Fraternities Can Expect
Lower Maintenance Costs

by Mike Perry
Dean of Fraternity Affairs
Dan Murphy told _Inter-
fraternity Council represen-
tatives they can expect the total
cost of the University
Maintenance Program to be

reduced by $8,000 for the 1980-81 »

school year. Savings to each
fraternity will vary in propor-
tion to their use of the program.

Murphy explained to the IFC
that he met with University
Treasurer Stewart Epely, and
Director of Building and
Grounds Arthur to review the
maintenance program’s first
six months of operation and pro-
ject the program’s 1980-81 cost
will be approximately $8,000

less than the $42,000 which was
previously estimated.

IFC President Monty Briscoe
announced that the IFC is plan-
ning to sponsor workshops for
fraternity presidents,
treasurers and food managers.

In other business, the IFC
Judicial Board questioned
representatives from the Sigma
Nu, Sigma Chi, and Phi Kappa
Psi fraternities regarding
funding of a joint Wednesday
night party. The fraternity
representatives assured the
IFC Judicial Board that funds
for the band and beer were
“chipped in’ by those in-
dividuals attending the party.

NEWS BRIEFS: Topless Jogging And A Record

Love Behind Bars

From Attica Prison, we have
the heartwarming news that
David Berkowitz, otherwise
known as ‘The Son of Sam,”
has fallen in love. The only pro-
blem is that Berkowitz’s in-
tended is a he and not a she.

Prison officials report that
Berkowitz’s object of affection
is fellow inmate Louis Quires, a
25 year-old transsexual. Quires,
who calls himself ‘‘Diane,”’ has
taken hormones and_ had
silicone implanted in his chest,
but prison officials have refused
to grant him a_ sex-change
operation.

Quires was moved to another
prison shortly after Berkowitz

apparently became enamored
of him.

Cat-Nipped

From Clifton Park, N.Y.,
comes this report of a feline
who overimbibed himself.

A couple was sleeping one
night when it was awakened by
the sound of its pet cat yelping.
The couple walked into the
living room where it discovered
the black-and-white beast flopp-
ing around and foaming at the
mouth, The couple immediately

rushed the cat to the local
veterinarian where the pro-
gnosis was given. Distemper?
No, drunk. Apparently, the cat
had knocked over a bottle of
bourbon in the kitchen while
prowling for food. The result: a
$77 bill for the owners and one
bad hangover for the cat.

The Naked Truth

Art and beauty are in the eyes
of “the beholder, or at least
that’s the opinion of the mayor
of McCall, Idaho.

At the recent annual McCall
Winter Festival, a_ local
sculptor had submitted a.
replica of the Mannekin Pis

statue carved in ice. Only one
thing bothered the festival com-
mittee, however, that being the
statue’s representation of a
naked body.

So on the afternoon that the
ice sculpture was supposed to
be put on display, a front-end
loading truck ran over the
sculpture. At least there was
enough ice for everyone.

Bustin-Out

From San Quinton Prison
comes the word that two con-

victs who escaped from the
prison in 1979 using a home-
made canoe, have for the se-
cond time in two months.
escaped the wrath of the jury.

The two suspects, both serv-
ing time for robbery, attempted
an escape from San Quentin
using a canoe made from wood
and plastic sheets. To convince
the guards, the inmates
painted ‘‘Rub-Dub-a-Dub,
Marin Yacht Club” on the-side
of the boat. One guard in the
prison’s watch tower was so
convinced of the canoe’s
authenticity that he hailed the
vessel, but only to see if tne two
paddlers were all right.

The two would-be escapees
said yes, and paddled on.

Topless Jogging

At a recent meeting, the Palm
Beach, Fla., town council
decided once again to address
the problem of topless joggers.
More specifically, the council
wanted to speak out against the
“unsightly problem of hairy
chested men jogging shirtless”’
through the streets of the af-
fluent community.

Palm Beach drew up a
“topless jogger”’ ordinance in
1979, but the ordinance was

ruled down as unconstitutional
by Florida courts. A revised
ban is scheduled to be drawn up
by the town council.

Record Hunt

The 1980 fall hunt season was
a record year for hunters who
killed 75,120 deer and posted

‘tags for 10,748 turkeys. Super-

vising game biologist in the
Charlottesville office of the
Commission of Game and—In-
land Fisheries Jack V. Gwynn
had predicted a total kill of
75,258 deer. One year Gwynn
missed the kill by only one
animal. And Gwynn may still
not be too far off since tags for
the kill usually come in about
one week after the season.

Visit Iran?

Looking for a fun and exciting
vacation? Why not Iran? Iran’s
second most, powerful religious
leader says that foreigners
could visit Iran without fear of
being taken hostage, but has
omitted information regarding
prisoners held in Iran’s jails.

The chief justice of the Ira-
nian Supreme court and leader
of the ruling Islamic

Republican Party Says any
foreigner who enters Iran with
a valid visa will be safe.
However, safety will only be
guaranteed as long asthe stay is
not in any way damaging to our
revolution. Sounds like a real
vacation bargain.

Faculty Members Placed On Revisions Committee

by W. Cope Moyers

The Executive Committee
moved one step closer to revis-
ing the White Book Monday
night when it approved a motion
including faculty members on
the White Book subcommittee.

The committee’s action
erases one of the final obstacles
before the subcommittee, which
will soon begin to review the
honor system and attempt to
revise those parts of the code it
thinks need to be changed.

Approval followed discussion
on whether members of the
faculty should be considered ad-
ministrators and thus, eligible
for membership on the sub-
committee. The EC had initially
favored only including two ad-
ministrators from the universi-

ty along with the three EC
members and three ‘students
that will also serve on the sub-
committee.

But at Monday night’s
meeting, EC member Jeff Ed-
wards’ motion including faculty
on the subcommittee was
approved 7-4, with Willie
Mackie, Bud White, Mike
Nogay and Ben Hale voting
against it.

Edwards’ motion followed the
committee’s rejection of
Marshall Clark’s motion that
would have considered the
faculty as administrators,
clearing the way for their inclu-
sion on the White Book subcom-
mittee and more importantly,
giving them the power to vote

on any recommendations the
subcommittee sends to the EC.
Clark’s motion was rejected as
all but three committee
members voted against it.
Clark, Jim Vines and President
Bob Willis were the only ones in
favor of the motion.

Mackie attempted to give the
committee tighter control over
which faculty members serve
on the subcommittee when he
made a motion requiring a two-
thirds approval of the full EC or
any faculty member that is a
candidate for the White Book
committee.

“This is serious business
revising the White Book,”’
Mackie said. ‘‘If we are going to
involve the faculty, we have to
examine them closer.”’

But the motion failed 3-8 with
Mackie, White and Nogay
voting in favor of the controver-
sial suggestions.

In other business, EC Presi-
dent Bob Willis announced that
petitions for the Big Three elec-
tions are due by March 3, along
with 150 signatures. Elections
for these three positions will
follow on March 9.

By March 16, petitions with 50
signatures are due for can-
didates running for class offices
and Executive Committee posi-
tions. Elections will be held one
week later.

The committee agreed to hold
the vote on the proposed con-
stitutional amendment change
February 24-26. The amend-

Survey Shows Freshman Career Plans

Nearly 30 percent of the
freshmen at Washington and
Lee University plan a career in
law, according to results of a
survey taken last fall among
entering students at W&L and
354 other colleges and univer-
sities throughout the nation.

Asked to indicate their
“probable career occupation,”’
29.9 percent of the W&L
freshmen surveyed selected the
“lawyer (attorney) or judge’
category. The national average
is 4.1 percent for all freshmen at
all the colleges which took part
in the study.

In past years, law has been
the leading career choice
among W&L freshmen in this
survey. Of those freshmen who
enrolled in the fall of 1979 and
took part in that survey, 25 per-
cent said they intend to become
lawyers.

The second most popular
career choice of the W&L
freshmen was ‘“‘business ex-
ecutive,’’ which was the choice
of 17.9 percent (as compared
with 10.1 percent on a national
basis).

Next came ‘‘physician,’’ with
13.6 percent of the W&L
freshmen selecting that career
(contrasted with 3.5 percent
nationally).

= SF Se =,

Monday.

Following those. three
categories were ‘‘writer or jour-
nalist,’’ which received 4.9 per-
cent response and ‘‘engineer’’
at 3.7 percent.

The survey was directed by
the Graduate School of Educa-
tion at UCLA, on behalf of the
American Council on Education
(ACE).

Law, business, and medicine
have been the leading career
choices at Washington and Lee
for the past decade or more,
according to these annual ACE
surveys.

As usual, a vast majority
—88.1 percent, to be specific
—of the freshmen surveyed in-
dicated that W&L’s ‘‘good
academic reputation’ was a
“very important” reason in the
decision to enroll in the school.
In the national survey of all 355
institutions, 50.8 percent of the
respondents checked ‘‘good
academic reputation” as their
reason for enrolling.

And also as usual, the W&L
freshmen characterized
themselves as politically con-
servative to a larger extent
than their peers around the
nation. At W&L, 42 percent in-
dicated that their political
orientation was conservative;
nationally, only 17 percent

chose conservative as_ their
political orientation. (The
Statistic for males in private
undergraduate colleges was
20.2 percent).

In response to several ques-
tions dealing with current social
concerns, 77.4 percent of the
W&L freshmen said they agree
(strongly or somewhat) that in-
flation is the biggest domestic
problem, 68 percent felt women
should be subject to the draft;
80.8 percent felt the Federal
government should do more to
discourage energy consump-
tion; 96.3 percent said all
college graduates should be

able to demonstrate some
minimal competency in written
English and mathematics,
while 29.7 percent agreed with
busing for school integration
and 24.1 percent favored
abolishing the death penalty.

As for their college expecta-
tions, 63.7 percent estimated the
chances are ‘“‘very good”’ that
they will join a social fraternity’
47 percent felt they will make at
least a ‘‘B” average; 67.7 per-
cent expect to be satisfied with
college; 17.2 percent anticipate
a change in career choice; and,
engaging in wishful thinking
perhaps, since W&L is an all-
male school, 1.6 percent expect
to live in a coeducational dorm.

ment, which would reduce the
number of students required to
vote from the present 3/4 to 20
percent, is intended to make it
easier for changes in the stu-
dent body constitution to occur.
Proposed amendments will still
need 75 percent of the ballots
cast before approval.

Two subcommittees made
monthly reports to the commit-
tee. The Phi reported that ex-
penses for issues 13-17 were
$1,290.46 and revenues
amounted to $3,166.20. The Cold
Check Committee reported that
about $467 had been collected
from students who had written
bad checks and that about $282
had also been collected from
former students.

Superdance: Bop til you Drop

by M. Shaw Pyle

It started three years ago
when W&L_ student Jay
Blumberg managed to create a
charity out of the void. Or
perhaps it started last year,
when W&L’s second Super-
dance made a tradition of an
innovation. But for most pur-
poses, planning for the 3rd An-
nual Washington and Lee
Muscular Dystrophy Super-
dance began in September of
1980 with an organizational
meeting that brought lots of
strangers away from their
books for a few hours; hours
which ended with a team of
friends where strangers had
been so recently. s

That September night was the
first in a series of meetings that
lasted every Sunday of classes
until January; in January, a
Thursday night meeting was
added to the weekly schedule.
These weekly meetings of the
Steering Committee required
the chairmen and often the
assistant chairmen to fake

hours away from books, black- |

jack, and bowl games to work
on a task that frequently
seemed both vain and infinite.

Beyond these few hours, in-.

dividual committees spent
many an additional night work-
ing patiently and quickly
toward...the Main Event.
Thursday night, February 5.
A final meeting to firm up all
the arrangements so patiently
and painstakingly created in
the preceding months. Minor
disasters: no lights, no mikes.
Feverish activity ensues;
scavenging turns up some last-
minute systems. The poster
designed to go over the door is
unfinished. The beer is going to
be tight. Team effort is
promised for the morrow.
Friday, February 6. The
promised teamwork
materializes. All morning,
crews work on transforming the
dining hall into a ballroom. The
afternoon sees the offices set up
for the finance people, who are
painting posters while enter-
tainment people work on
registration. After dinner, the
dining hall is finally emptied of

chairs and tables. The ring for
the dancers is set up. Sound and
light systems are checked over.
The first pledge sheets trickle in
and the adding machines begin
to chatter. Eight o’clock: Presi-
dent Huntley kicks off the
marathon. Gate receipts and
beer money mount. Food and
Refreshment chairman Nils
Herdelin begins his lifesaving
distribution of coffee to the
workers. Nine o'clock sees the
first hourly total: too low? The:
chairmen start to sweat, but
finance chairman Phil Browne
insists on conservative
estimates. J. Hemby and Tripp
Brower infect the crew and
crowds with a _ contagious
energy. The adding machines
rattle on. Slowly, the totals
begin to show signs of life.
Attendance is low at the gate;
sweat glistens on a few finan-
cial brows. Everything slows
down as the night falls into mor-
ning: only the music and the ad-

totals slowly rise. The dancers,
too, are rising a little more
slowly; blisters, headaches and
exhaustion are reaching
epidemic proportions. There‘s
hardly a spectator left, and
morale is beginning to falter.
Through the fog, the dancers
dimly hear an equally tired J.

so good.

By six, the dancers are back
on the floor, and staff is again
manning the _ barricades.
Herdelin is working’ on
breakfast, Townsend Oast and
Ed Kramer are coordinating
the sound and light to wake up
the dancers, and the adding
machines are still going. Hem-
by and Brower are floating in
caffeine. Bluegrass is better
than sleep, right, guys?

Oast is sweating. Brower is
sweating. Hemby is too tired to
sweat. The reggae band is late.
Very late. Too late; Oast cuts to
tapes. Knock, knock. It’s the
reggae band.

Silence, no; but even above
the bands there seems to be a
sound missing. The adding

machines are off. Brower and
this reporter relax and start on
another gallon or so of coffee..
The pledges are tabulated, and
Carole Chappel and the W&L
secretaries have donated their
time to handle the billing.
Finance is on autopilot;

Herdelin, the chairmen, and T.

are the only ones still running
hard. Lunch passes swiftly and
then the dancing resumes.

Dancing. Breaks. Dancing and

to stumble in. Cautious op-
timism begins to replace the
alternate euphoria and despair
of finance; the numbers are

there. Entertainment and the ~

This machine has_ been
around for at least 3 years. Un-
fortunately nothing is known

Seriously, rumor has it that it is

This machine, the newest
among all of the machines in

watch if not to play. The psycho-
suggestive aspect of this
machine (a voice synthesizer
alternately moans ‘‘OOOH”’
and signs ‘‘AAH’’ thus making
it pleasing to both genders)
scarcely needs to be com-
mented upon. The thrill of
“entering Xenon” and trying a
‘‘tube shot’’ speak for
themselves. Suffice it to say
that the flippers are referred to
as “‘thrusters.’’ If Freud were

Many people, claiming to be
purists, prefer the tangible
aspects of the standard pinball
machines. They claim that
playing video games is a rather
vacuous experience — not
unlike taking a shower in a rain-
coat. While such criticisms are
rather extreme, there are some
problems with this new form of
entertainment. First of all, time
cannot be taken in between
players as it can on a pinball
machine. More importantly,
you can never win a free game
— only an ‘‘extended play.”’ It is
in this sense that video games
are akin to cancer — you know
that you cannot beat it, the only
question is seeing how long you
can hang on. Nevertheless

  

 

these machines have become
increasingly popular and now
command the lion’s share of the
market.
Space Invaders

This is the machine that
started the whole video craze.
While its popularity has
diminished somewhat, it still
has a very loyal following which
will line up for what seems like
hours to play. It’s very easy —
using your barriers, destroy the
alien ships before they destroy
you. Very simple. Often very
expensive. Extra ‘“‘bonus laser”’
at 1500 points.

Galaxian

For many people this is the
machine. It is not unlike Space
Invaders, but with an added
dimension. While you try to
destroy the alien ships, they are
advancing and diving on you.
Hit two yellows and a red in
convoy and 800 points are yours.
Look out for the purple ships
and try to stay out of the

‘corners. Extra ship at 7,000

points.

MonacoG.P.

A rather juvenile game, this
machine is usually played by
only townies or freshmen. Any
serious student of reckless
driving will put his quarters
towards a six-pack and opt for
the road to Briar or Macon on a
foggy, rainy night. Anything
else pales in comparison.
Besides, it is too loud and ob-
noxious for such a pip-squeak
machine. Extra game at 2,000
points.

Asteroids

Although many people avoid
this game (for some its rather
austere white-on-black motif
renders it chromatically boring
if not downright hideous), it is
the staple of many video buffs.
Requiring a rather large degree
of dexterity and eye-to-hand
coordination, for many it has
become heir to the Space In-
vaders legacy. You get three
ships; hit the small ‘stroids and
deal on the flying saucers, and
the extra ship is yours.

Note: This is the third in a series
of articles by Sports Editor Ralph
Frasca.

Boyd Williams, long-time
assistant coach of the
Washington and Lee football
team, is the subject of this
week’s interview. Williams
spent a year with the
Philadelphia Eagles during
their glory years, when legends
such as Pete Pihos and Steve
Van Buren made the Eagles a
dominant force in the NFL.

Williams went to Syracuse
University during the war-torn
1940’s. Upon graduation he
joined the Richmond Rebels, a
minor league football team
which had a working agreement
with the Pittsburgh Pirates
(who have since changed their
name to the Steelers). Williams

Sports

The Football Career

Of Boyd Williams

spent the 1946 season with the
Rebels, where his dogged play
as a lineman attracted the at-
tention of pro scouts. Subse-
quently, the Philadelphia
Eagles purchased his contract.

Williams spent the entire 1947
with Philly, seeing action at
offensive center and defensive
linebacker (gridiron athletes
played two-way back then).

However, Williams’ primary
interest lay in the coaching
aspect of football.

“I’ve wanted to be a coach
since I was young,’’ he recalled.
‘Tt just couldn’t get . into
coaching fast enough. A good
coach needs playing experience
in his sport, though, and I
wanted to play in the pros for a
little while. All I wanted was a
small dose of medicine as a
player, which I assumed would
be sufficient in my search for

Matmen Get Troun

knowledge of coaching tech-
niques.”’

Williams could not have
learned from a more proficient
mentor than Eagles’ coach
Greasy Neale, now enshrined in
the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

“Greasy taught me to com-
pete. He used to tell me, ‘You’ve
got to work hard and be
dedicated, because someone is
out to beat you every day.’
Philadelphia had a_ great
organization, and, I was
priviledged to be a part of it.”

Williams married, and then
returned to the Rebels in 1948.
After the season, he was offered
the head coaching job of the
VMI football team. After a two-
year stint at the military school,
he assumed a similar post at the
University of Richmond. In
1954, he was lured to W&L to
revitalize a sagging football

_team, which had been scarred

as a result of a major cheating
scandal the previous year.
Prior to the scandal, W&L was a
major college football team in
Division I, having produced
such outstanding players as Bill
Chipley, Mike Boyda, and
current Jets’ head coach Walt
Michaels, as well as playing in
the Gator Bowl.

As a result of the scandal, the
1954 football schedule was
cancelled, and_ grant-in-aid
scholarships were abolished.

“The athletic department
asked me to come in and
reorganize the football team.
Well, I managed to get enough
players together, and we played
four games on the JV level,”
said Williams.

The Generals reappeared on the
varsity level in 1955, but this
time they participated on the
Division III level. The policy of

Pembroke Invitational

by John Harrison

The W&L wrestling team was
abruptly brought back to reality
last Saturday, as it began the
last month of the season by be-
ing totally outclassed by a
strong field in the Pembroke
State (N.C.) Invitational. As a
result, the Generals lost what
momentum they had picked up
in two duel meet victories at the
end of January in what proved
to be a disappointing anc
frustrating situation.

Duke, South Carolina, and the
hosting school, which has four
Division II All-Americans, kept
the Generals from ever serious-
ly challenging for a finish in one
of the top spots. With the excep-
tion of heavyweight Carlton

Peebles, the only General to
come up with a win, Richard
Kopleman, Tim Valliere and
captain Dave Stoeffel were the
only others who were ever in
their matches.

Coach Gary Franke had a
straightforward explanation for
the team’s performance: ‘‘We
came up pretty flat. It was a
disappointing showing and it’s
obvious we didn’t do a good
job.”’ Coach Franke added that
it was indicative of how the
team has done against Division
I and II competition. ‘‘Our pro-
blem was that in the classes
that we matched up fairly well,
we not only lost but were
pinned. That really hurt us in
the standings for team points.”’

The Generals held their final
home match last night in
Warner Center, a duel meet
with James Madison. The
Dukes are a strong contender
for the state Division I cham-
pionship. The season will end
next weekend with Friday and
Saturday duel meets at David-
son and Catawba.

The season will be extended
at least one week for freshmen
Valliere (158) and Peebles.
They will be competing in the
Division III Eastern Regionals
Saturday the 20th in Salisbury,
Maryland. The regionals are
the first step towards the
National Championships in
Cleveland, Ohio.

 

 

no longer offering scholarships
hurt the athletic program, the
effects of which plagued the
sports program for some time.

Williams was originally
slated to do nothing more than
rebuild the team, but the
coaching techniques to which he
was so dedicated earned him a
post as the assistant coach in
charge of defensive linemen, a
position which he has held to
this day. “‘I consider myself for-
tunate to be at a school like
Washington and Lee,”’ Williams|
stated. “I like the small-town:

there are many advantages toa
small college, particularly in
regards to athletics. For in-
stance, it is easy for a player to
counsel with his coach here,
whereas it is almost impossible
for an Alabama football player
to talk privately with Bear
Bryant.” Williams appears to
be satisfied with his niche at
Washington and Lee, and the
success of the defensive line,
especially this past season,
reflects his devotion to his job.

Generals Fall To E&H, Top Lynchburg

by Dale Park

It has been an unpredictable,
up and down season for head
coach Verne Canfield and the
Washington and Lee varsity
basketball team.

On February 4th, the
Generals dropped a 70-60 deci-
sion to ODAC rival Emory and
Henry on the Wasps’ home
court — the first time in seven-
teen years that W&L had lost to
E&H in basketball.

To make matters. worse,
W&L’s senior co-captain Carby
Hoy sustained an ankle injury
in the E&H game and will be out
for an indefinite period.

Hoy joins senior co-captain R.
J. Scaggs (lost earlier in the
season to a broken hand) and
junior guard George Spears
(who injured his shoulder
several weeks ago but who has
subsequently returned) in a
growing list of injured or ailing
Generals’ starters.

The consistent bright spot for
the Generals has been the play
of senior center Rob Smither-
man.

Smitherman alone generated
almosf half of the team’s scor-
ing in the E&H loss (he scored
24 points) and had about a third
of the team’s total rebounds (he
grabbed 15).

“Smitherman is playing the
best he has ever played, on both
ends of the court,” says Can-
field.

The only other W&L player in
double figures was freshman
forward John Graves. Graves,
who scored 11 points, has seen a
great deal of playing time as a
result of the injuries the team
has suffered. ’

On the night the Generals shot
a frigid 36 percent from the

floor.

Yet last Saturday night this
same W&L team hosted ODAC
rival Lynchburg College, a
team which defeated the
Generals earlier in the year,
87-79. Despite the fact W&L
played without Hoy and used a
wide assortment of make-shift
line-ups, the Generals got out to
a sixteen-point lead at one point
and held on for an exciting 80-75
victory.

But why the difference
between the Lynchburg and
E&H games? Further, why
have the Generals compiled an

- astonishing 13-2 record at home

while they have managed to win
only one game on the road while
losing four?

Although Canfield offered no
excuses, he did comment that
“one of our problems is our in-
consistency in getting ready for
a game and our respect for the
opponent we are playing. The
tougher the team, the better we
have played. Another problem
is that we don’t always play
together — too often everyone
tries to be a scorer and they
forget their roles.”

In the Lynchburg game
Smitherman again played his
“role” very well, scoring 22
points.and grabbing seven re-
bounds.

Spears and junior guard.

Clark New scored thirteen and
twelve points, respectively,
while sophomore forward Brian
Hanson added 15 points.

“The Lynchburg game was
pleasing,’ offered Canfield,
‘because we showed good ball
control and shot selection.”

As a result, W&L’s shooting
heated up to an impressive 64
percent from the floor.

The Generals now move into
the last part of their season.
Five games remain before the
ODAC Tournament; four away
games against ODAC rivals and
one home game against a non-
ODAC team.

In light of the Generals away-
game record, this last group of
games will be very critical.
While offering no particular
reason for their away game
troubles, Canfield did say that
“Teams just want to beat us so

other team on their schedule,

Rein and Lewis are “‘ex-
amples of how much a non-

gram,” according to Canfield.
‘People sometimes don’t
realize what Brad and Pokey
have done to help. They’ve
taken care of so many details
and done it willingly and
efficiently.”

Hoy, Smitherman, and
Scaggs started the season as the
nucleus to the team. Hoy, a
guard, and Smitherman, a
center, are still in the line-up.

Wrestling Team Problems Explained

Sports Editor's Note: The
following article was written b y an
“insider” on the wrestling team.

A recent issue of the Ring-
tum Phi detailed the woes and
tribulations of the 1980-81
Generals wrestling team. The
team, so the article reported,
was suffering from seemingly
insurmountable malaise. Three
squad members had departed,
including co-captain and ODAC
champ Mike McFadden. In
addition, the morale of the team
was reportedly very low. The
time, experience and success
have wrought changes upon the
grapplers.

Two of the three departees
have returned to the squad.
McFadden is now functioning in
the role of instructor for the
team, assisting eight-year
coach Gary Franke. In addi-
tion, Elbert Umila has re-
turned, and is now quickly
becoming re-acquainted with
the demanding program. More
importantly, the team’s morale

and relationship with Coach
Franke has improved. At the
first of the year, it appeared
that the season was a potential
disaster. Moreover, some of the
newcomers had some trouble
adjusting to Franke’s coaching
style, as well as his expecta-
tions for each wrestler. Franke
is a perfectionist — a hard-
driving man who demands 100
percent effort every day in
practice as well as in the match
situation. He asks that each
wrestler work hard to achieve a
greater degree of wrestling ex-
pertise. This pressure, coupled
with academic demands, may
have caused some of the first-
year members to be less than
effective on the mat.

But this tense atmosphere has
lessened greatly since the first
of the year. The hard work
devoted each day in the
wrestling room has begun to
show on the wrestling mat.
Regarding wins, the team has
surpassed the mark of last

year’s squad. The defeatist at-
titude that haunted the team
earlier in the season has disap-
peared,

A positive outlook has pervad-
ed since the Glassboro State
match, in which the team was
humiliated by a vastly superior
foe. A strong speech was given
by team captain David Stoeffel,
who admitted to the team that
he was tired of losing, tired of
the bad attitude on the team.
After that speech, most team
members began to look at the
season in a different light. This
new attitude resulted in the
gradual improvement of the
team’s fortunes.

However, a_ drastic

turnaround has not resulted,
nor is it likely to, since, as
Franke believes, the team is
still not mentally prepared to do
battle effectively inside the
white circle. He is still op-
timistic, though. In Franke’s
opinion, mental preparedness,
or, aS he calls it, ‘mental

toughness,”’ is equally as im-
portant as_ physical and
technical fitness. He feels that
the team’s poor attitude has
been a major contributing fac-
tor in the teams unsuccessful
season.

In the final analysis, the team
has probably been both its own
worst enemy and _ strongest
Supporter. Feeding on each
other’s bad attitudes at the
beginning of the season, the
team suffered from an “I
Can’t” syndrome. Now, albeit
too late, the attitude has im-
proved, but Franke is still
pressing hard to maintain the
improvement. As skills and con-
fidence increase, mental
toughness will become an in-
tegral part of the team in the
years to come. With his crop of
new and talented young
wrestlers, the enthusiastic
Franke should be able to lead
them to more successful and en-.
joyable seasons. Moreover, the

wrestlers of the future should
also keep in mind the dark days,
,and the inspiration they have
received from team members
who will soon graduate. Their
example is a fine one to follow.

Track Team Runs Into

Trouble At VMI Relays

by Rick Swagler

It was not a pretty sight. As
coach Norris Aldridge put it, it
was the kind of meet you “‘don’t
like to talk about.’’ Saturday,
W&L ran in the VMI Relays.
Because most of the teams com-
peting were Division I or II,
W&L — quite frankly — got
swamped. None of the com-
peting team members placed in
the top five of any events.

Despite the team’s perfor-
mance, both Howard Herndon
and Alan Armitage set personal
records. Herndon’s_ record
came in the mile and
Armitage’s in the 55-meter high
hurdles. In other events, the
team of Paul Chapman, Chester
Townsend, Jon Kelefant, and
Herndon combined to run the
distance medley — a relay com-
posed of the half-mile, the
quarter-mile, the three-quarter

mile and the mile. The team of
Bob Jenevein, Bill Morris, and
the Kadesky twins ran what
Aldridge called a ‘‘good 440
relay.” The best event for the
team was the shuttle relay.
Here, the team of Armitage,
Parker Schenecker, Todd
Howe, and Russ Rector placed
sixth.

In individual events, Rector
competed in the high jump and
Kevin Kadesky competed in the
55-meter dash.

The meet was packed with
talent. Two runners from Rich-
mond ran in the prestigious
Milrose Games the night before
and a runner from Norfolk set
an unofficial world record in the
55-meter dash. Aldridge com-
mented that the record would
not be allowed because it was
hand-timed, but remarked ‘“‘he
was flying.”’

Aldridge said that the team
should be in ‘‘better shape’’ by
the Lynchburg Relays on the
2ist. Expected to compete at
Lynchburg are High Point
College, Bridgewater College,
Fairmont College, Francis
Marion, and W&L.

In regard to the ODAC cham-
pionship on the 28th, Aldridge
stated that Bridgewater will be
the team to beat due to strength
in the field events, and the same
will be true for outdoor season.
Of the championship, Aldridge
said, ‘‘We could place 2nd if we
run well. I’m not saying it’s im-
possible for us to get ist. In
athletics you never know.”

The Lynchburg Relays will be
held Saturday, the 2ist, with
field events beginning at 2:00
and running events beginning at
3:00.

Track Program Examined

by Alan S. Armitage

The indoor track season has
begun, and the W&L track team,
has gotten off to a respectable
start. Placing third in a 6-team
meet in Lynchburg two weeks
ago and participating in the
V.M.I. relays against Division I
schools this past weekend, the
team has demonstrated
promise.

Many people seem to have
gotten the wrong impression
about indoor track. Most of
W&L’s opponents began train-
ing before winter break, and
are prepared for indoor com-
petition as a season, not as a
warm-up for the outdoor
season. However, Washington
and Lee’s track team does not
participate in indoor track in
this manner. The indoor season
is comparable to spring train-
ing games in baseball or the

Soccer

Washington & Lee senior
Bryan Williams, a three-year
Generals’ soccer standout, will
attend a closed try-out practice
on Saturday and Sunday, Feb.

14-15, with the Charlotte
Lightnin’ of the American
Soccer League.

Williams, a resident of Rich-
mond, Va., will be one of 75
athletes at the session, which
will be directed by Charlotte
Lightnin’ head coach Rodney
Marsh.

‘This is the type of opportuni-
ty Bryan has been working
toward,’’ W&L head coach Rolf
Piranian. ‘‘He’s proved himself
as a capable leader and
talented player in college. He

pre-season in football; it is a
way for the team to settle into a
competitive stance and to
evaluate its fitness, cohesion,
and spirit.

Spirit is an important part of

any team and the track team is
certainly not lacking in this
area. Even when exhausted in
the middle of their own
workout, team members still
cheer a teammate in_ his
workout. The athletes supportt
each other in their individual]
events. Even though the team
works out separately as
sprinters, distance men, and
throwers, no factionalism of
separation exists.

Intensive running and weight
workouts have gotten the team
in shape while work on in-
dividual events has prepared
the team for its meets. Coach
Aldridge has used the school’s

make a good showing.”

Coaches Aldridge and Miriello
the experience of the veterans

This year’s Washington and

potential, both in its rookies and
in its veterans. With the realiza-
tion of this potential, the team
should achieve another winning

Swimmers Are
Beaten Twice

by Phil Murray
The W&L swimming team
lost twice last Saturday to
Davidson, 72-39 and to Furman,
61-46, dropping the season meet
record to 3-6.

In terms of individual suc-
cess, however, the season is just
beginning for the Generals. As
Coach Page Remillard said,
“The most exciting part of our
season is yet to come.”’

The team has been gearing up
for the upcoming invitationals,
beginning in two weeks, and for
the NCAA Division III Cham-
pionships on March 19-21.

“Our goals have become
oriented towards the Nationals
and our training methods are
emphasizing that. One result is
tired swimmers,’ stated
Remillard.

workouts to get them in top

condition for the UNC-
Wilmington Invitational on Feb.
20. This weekend, the Generals
will face VCU, a tough Division
I school, and VMI in their final
dual meet of the season.

“‘We’re just looking for some
good individual times this week,
so that we can be rested and
healthy for the UNC Invita-
tional. We should be swimming
well in two weeks, and we’re
looking forward to some fast
times then,” Remillard opined.

While the meet record is not
as good as the team would like,
the individual performances
are up to Remillard’s expecta-
tions.

Six Generals have already
qualified to compete in the
NCAA Championships, and
Remillard expects three or four
more additions before long.
Mike Bernot has earned his
sport in the 50 and 100-yard
freestyle events, and freshman
Tim Rock will compete in the
1000 and 1650-yard free. The 400

Scaggs Discovers New Side
After Suffering Injury

by Fred Mumford

At the exact mid-point of the
present Washington & Lee
University basketball season,
R. J. Scaggs suddenly found
himself in a new role with the
Generals.

Scaggs, a talented senior
from Roanoke, Va., opened the
season as a starting forward for

_W&L. Thirteen games into the
team’s 25-game regular-season
schedule, however, he broke his
right (shooting hand) wrist

during the second half of W&L’s -

82-79 double-overtime win
against Emory & Henry College
on January 15. As a result,
Scaggs has now become a scout,
recruiter, and assistant coach,
responsibilities which,
understandably, are a new ball
game to the two-year starter.

‘Recruiting and scouting are
a lot harder than playing,” the
personable Scaggs admits, ‘‘but
I think I can offer a prospective
player certain things which
Coach Canfield (W&L head
coach Verne) can’t. For exam-
ple, my first-hand experience
enables me to answer questions
pertaining to Coach Canfield’s
coaching and his philosophies.”

Scaggs’ immediate coaching
tasks under Canfield, W&L’s
17th-year director, center
around attention to freshman
John Graves and sophomore
Franke Eppes. Graves, a 6-5
forward from Norfolk, Va., and
Eppes, a 6-9 center from Green-
ville, S.C., are reserve players
this season but could, with
Scaggs’ help, develop into key
components of future W&L
squads.

A key component — such was

Scaggs’ playing role prior to the
injury. He averaged 10.1 points
and 4.6 rebounds in each of
those 13. outings, statistics
which were substantial im-
provements over his junior
season (6.9 points, 4.1 re-
bounds).

“R. J. was given more of a.
green light on offense and
defense this year,’ explains
Canfield, who has seen Scaggs
develop from a freshman junior
varsity performer into a consis-
tent varsity starter. ‘“‘He has the
ability to get the timely basket
or cause a turnover when the
team really needs a break.

When basketball ends in

Dean’s List honors many times

door track team, where he holds

Gee: Epitomy Of

by Ed Gonsalves

Do not tell Washington & Lee
University swimmer Jeff Gee
that college life is difficult. He
will not believe it.

Gee, a freshman backstroker
from Johnson City, Tennessee,
has indeed succeeded in both
the pool and in the classroom at
W&L. Yet talking with the
modest student-athlete, you

would never know this.
Gee explains his role on the

Generals’ team as “‘basically
one in which I try to do what I
can when I can. I try to plug the
holes when the team needs it.”’
His coach, second-year director
Page Remillard, is less modest
about Gee’s contributions.

‘He is the type of person who
makes a coach look good,
because he is always putting out
100 percent and then some. I
have confidence that he will
qualify for Nationals (the
NCAA Division III Champion-
ship meet on March 19-21) this
year and continue to improve
during his years at W&L.”’

Jeff’s work and dedication to
the swim program is probably
best seen in his transition from
a small, coarse swimming pro-
gram at Johnson City to
Remillard’s extensive pro-
gram, which includes almost
10,000 daily yards of swimming.

“It wasn’t too hard to adjust
to the extra swimming, but it
did take time,’’ offered the
blond-haired Gee, who jokes
that “‘the hardest part was get-
ting used to the pre-season
morning practice.”’

Gee had no problem adjusting
to the academic demands of
W&L, earning a perfect 4.0

Student-Athlete

 

  

grade point average in his first

term. Gee attributes his
academic success in part to the
honor code. ‘I chose W&L
because it has an honor system.
I knew that the academic en-
vironment would be challeng-

ing.’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The Crime Report

Lexington’s annual police report contains some
good news along with alot of bad news. In his preface
to the annual report, Chief Kirby is quick to point out
there were no reported cases of murder or
manslaughter in the last year. Kirby said he was
pleased there were no violent crimes last year — yet
he admitted the fact that there was an attempted rape
— an act we certainly call a violent crime. And
anyone who has ever had the opportunity to get

jumped in Lexington can attest to the existence of '

violent crime in this small town.

We realize it would be ridiculous to think any town
— including little Lexington — could be totally free of
crime. At the same time we think it would be absurd
to say the police department is doing anything more
than a mediocre job. All year long we have observed
crime and tried to report on its consistently. Because
of certain laws, we can not cover most cases of
juvenile delinquency, but there are indications that
juvenile crime is also a problem here. The bottom line
is that Lexington really has fewer incidents of crime
than many cities; the crime statistics do not mean
much when crime strikes you or your friends. We
hope the police department can get its butt in gear,
spend some time working on ways to prevent pro-
blems, and maybe even hire someone who is
knowledgeable in crime prevention. Sure it is easy to
ride around in a quarter-ton tricycle writing tickets,
but it would be better to see some action toward clean-
ing this problem up.

Congratulations

After reading the crime report this week and before
packing to leave town, we thought we should remind
people to lock up for break. Take advantage of the
storage service, take your valuables home or leave
them with friends. It only takes a little time to lock up
and make sure you are protected for break — we urge
you to take the time and button up for the holiday.

Button Up

We would like to congratulate J. Hemby and Tripp
Brower for running a successful and well organized
Superdance. It is interesting to see a group take on a
project and show the type of responsibility necessary
to put on a marathon dance. While Rom Weatherman
makes a good point in his letter to the editor (he
thinks students should contribute to the local United
Way), we also support the Superdance and the im-
pressive job it has done in the last three years. There
are so many charities it is difficult to single one out
for special attention, but W&L seems to have found its
charity and should stick with one that is run so well.

Hall Criticizes Ariel Review

Dear Editor:

After reading the review of
Ariel in the February 5th issue
of The Ring-tum Phi, I feel com-
pelled to comment upon Mr.
Pyle’s criticism of the
“ magazine’s Fall edition.

Mr. Pyle suggests that the
Ariel staff engaged in a
deliberate effort to make the
magazine appear <“‘artsy.’”’ He
labels many of the works in
Ariel as merely feigned
attempts of circumlocution.
Ariel, he claims, is far too

' esoteric.

Yet, Mr. Pyle does not apply
the same standards he uses in
judging Ariel to his own review,
which is rather affected and
strained. The use of an expres-

sion such as “‘the legions of
literate lectors’’ seems quite
periphrastic to me. The review
itself commits the sins he
bewails.

I would agree with Mr. Pyle,
however, that much of the
material in Ariel is not of suffi-
cient merit to be included in, let
us say, Shenandoah or the
Sewanee Review. If the editors
applied the criteria of these pro-
fessional publications to our
student manuscripts, Ariel
would be a slim, if not non-
existent, volume. Few among
W&L’s current student writers
have won Pulitzer Prizes in
Poetry.

One must remember that
Ariel is a student publication,

and as such, must work within
the limitations of the material
submitted to the editors. When
examined with a_ sense of
perspective and with ap-
propriate expectations, the cur-
rent Ariel compares quite
favorably with not only past edi-
tions of Ariel, but also with the
student literary magazines of
other colleges.

Mr. Pyle could perhaps cor-
rect the malaise which he
perceives (if indeed one exists
at all) by encouraging the
growth of student writing at
Washington and Lee rather
than by condemning theAriel.

Lately they’ve given us Ron and

Pyle would serve admirably
He’s already polished off one
cadre of pinko college writers.
He could herald a new dawn in
American literature. The
slogans ring through the air:
‘“Imitate Tolkien, Lewis, and
Mecken!”’ ‘‘Down with ‘mystic
vvertones and mythic propor-

tions’!’’ ‘‘There’s a_ snoblet

Hinely Recalls Year Of No Fancy Dress

Fancy Dress of 1971 that never

recollections of my _ student
days at W&L during what has
come to be known as_ the
‘radical years’ (though I would
be more specific and accurate
in terming the early 1970’s as
the ‘relatively radical left
years.”

Traditions weren't really
dying, except for the speaking
tradition, which I still miss
—they were hibernating. Many
of us were more concerned with
the posture of defying authority
than in doing so with the ‘in-
telligence we wanted so badly to
claim and which we felt so
frustrated in seeking at an
institution which seemed so pro-
ud of its traditions that it refus-
ed to accept the fact that, like it

Superdance

For Local

United Way?

Dear Editor:

I know the Superdance is fun
and all of that — and all for a
worthy cause, too. Very com-
mendable. But doesn’t nearly
all of the money raised go off
somewhere?

I think Washington and Lee
students have an overriding
obligation of service to the com-
munity in which they study.
Why not stage a Superdance on
behalf of the local United Way,
which is now struggling every
year to meet its goal?

It would be a proper and
generous thing to do.

Rom Weatherman

the 20th century. Hunter
Thompson’s writings weren’t
stylish then, but made a lot
more sense on the gut level.

It is a fact that the SAB —
then the Dance Board Budget
couldn’t accommodate concerts
and a grand wazoo Fancy Dress
ball. The student tax was les.
than half of what it is now.

Many students preferred to.

spend their money on fun drugs.
A $20 per couple party of any
kind wouldn’t have gone over
any better than a lead balloon
unless the band had _ been
someone on the scale of Led
Zeppelin, and such bands’ going

rates for an evening were

higher than the total annual
budget for the Dance Board.
The Allman Brothers concert
was an extremely lucky fluke
and it was much better than any
Grateful Dead concert I’ve ever
heard. Those California boys
may have rhythm but they ain’t
got no soul.

As I recall, both ‘heads’ and

 

‘straights,’ and this place was
about 50-50 then, enjoyed the
hell out of that show. No one
bitched about there not being a
Fancy Dress because they
could still dress up for the frat
formal if that was their thing.

If there were gripers, they
“ast didn’t show, which was
easy enough; the alternative for
‘straights’ was to stay at the
frat house, tip a few more and
gator to the usual soul bands.
The lack of grain at pavilion
parties made no difference ex-
cept for fewer car wrecks and
fights. At the time, grass, LSD
and the like were enjoyed as a
more positively social alter-
native to alcohol in mass
quanitities.

All this bellyaching about the
SAB’s performance and integri-
ty lately seems rather nit-
picking to me. Having seen a
variety of well-meaning but
inept chairmen ‘(as well as a
few genuine lounge lizards)
over the past decade, the stu-

dent body should consider itself
fortunate to have the likes of
this year’s crew. Already they
have exceeded in both quality
and quantity. above anyone I
can remember. They may even
pull off an old pipedream of
mine: W&L’s first Jazz
Festival. Time will tell.

Last but not least, about Mr.
Pyle’s assessment of the Ariel.
As one who writes in the role of
a critic myself, I certainly
uphold the principle that critics
are entitled to their own
opinions. But over the years, I
have found that disdain is a
poor substitute for
knowledgeability in the field be-
ing reviewed and/or victimized.

All personal tastes aside, it
strikes _me as_ counter-
productive to criticize so
scathingly the only university-
sanctioned outlet students have
for the dying art form of
creative writing outside of the
classroom. (And the relation-
ship and priority scheme of

 

 

 

form vs. content within the
classroom is open to question in
too many cases).

So this is a thin year for stu-
dent writings. The Ariel people
haven't wasted any of their
space taking the Phi to pieces
for its many faults, though it
can be argued that Phi
coverage in too many instances
has given new meaning to the
idea that no news is good news.
So you might take that into
account and return the favor.

Without going so far as to sug-
gest that if you can’t say
anything nice, don’t say
anything at all, I will say that I
have learned to devote energy
and space only to good things I
wish to share with others. If
you’ve got ya-yas to get out, get
a punching bag. Ariel has had
the crap beaten out of it enough
already, though they do have a
way of coming up with more.

Reagan’s First Speech And Va.’s Beer Proposal

by Jed Dunn
Last week, President Reagan
addressed. the nation in his first

televised speech since taking

office. Immediately following
the speech, analysts on all three
major television networks
‘interpreted’ the President’s
message for their viewers. Con-
sider the implications of this.

To the average citizen, the
President represents respon-
sibility, authority, account-
ability and, by the virtue of
these attributes, can deliver his
message with its intended im-
pact. But due to the television
industry’s instantaneous
transmissions and _ quick-
thinking commentaries, an

editorial analysis immediately
assaults the viewer, denying
him the opportunity to assess
the impact of the speech
according to his own personal

criterion.

This power of the elec-
tronic/visual press. is_ indeed
awesome. By interpreting the
President’s remarks and
revealing selected insights
immediately following the
speech, the commentators can
manipulate and editorialize any
meaning the President might
have intended. While the
freedom and objectivity of the
press should be endorsed, it is
unfair to both the President and
the average citizen for
immediate analyses to be
made. Citizens should be given
the necessary time to make
reflective judgements of such
speeches unimpeded by any im-
mediate television editorial-
izing.

On Jan. 26, Virginia’s House
of Delegates passed a resolution
requiring an individual to be 18

years to purchase beer in
restaurants and at least 19 to
purchase beer in retail stores.

~The rationale~ behind..this..ab-_ .

surd proposal is to keep ‘‘beer
out of the high schools and off of
the road.”’ Certainly this is a no-
ble intention, but there are
some hard facts which need
consideration.

First, the now familiar argu-
ment that a voting-age citizen,
who is also eligible for the draft,
should not be arbitrarily denied
the privileges of citizenship,
e.g. the right to purchase beer.

Second, and perhaps more
importantly, the resolution is,
in effect, a government subsidy
for the restaurant industry. By
government decree, this pro-
posal entitles only restaurants
to meet the market demands of
18-year-old beer drinkers.
Retail stores are legally barred

from these sales and, therefore,
a substantial lessening of
competition may result. The

price to.consumers may go up

and the total revenue of retail
outfits may go down, both as a
result of government regula-
tion.

Finally, the aim to “‘get
drinkers off the road’’ is con-
tradicted by this proposal. 18-
year-olds who choose to con-
sume will be forced to drink in

restaurants, away from their
residences. What happens is
‘ that we find more drunks on the

highway trying to get home
from the restaurant because
they couldn’t buy beer to con-
sume at home.

What seems to be the solution
is undeniably worse than the in-
itial affliction. Hopefully, the
state legislature will see its
folly and opt this one to the’
trash bin.

d. On the day scheduled for

your SPRING COURSE RE-
QUEST CARD along with a
copy of your record. Take these

concept and conditions of
happiness, comparing and con-
trasting various views from
Aristotle to the present day.
Topics to be considered in-
clude: What relations do
pleasure, desire, need, moral
virtue, effort and knowledge
bear to happiness? Can one be
happy without knowing one is
happy? Does happiness vary
from person to person? Is
happiness a momentary state
or a life-long activity? Is hap-
piness directly proportional to
pleasure? Is happiness — or its
pursuit — a duty, a right, a
need, a (nearly-?) universal
desire, or what? Why is it
almost a tautology (is it?) to
say that ‘‘everyone wants to be

‘ happy’’?
