Simpson Named Johnson Selected Rhodes Scholar

Assistant Dean

. by Robert Keefe

Pamela Hemenway Simpson,
an art history teacher at
Washington and Lee University
since 1972, has been named
assistant dean of the College,
W&L’s arts and sciences divi-
sion, effective Sept. 1, 1981.

She succeeds Edward D.
Craun, who will return to
teaching in the English depart-
ment after three years in the
post.

Simpson is a Ph.D. graduate
of the University of Delaware in
art history. She earned her B.A.
degree from Gettysburg Col-
lege and her master’s from the
University of Missouri. Since
joining the Washington and Lee
faculty in 1973, her fields of
teaching have included courses
in 20th-century European and

Ed Johnson sits in his
research room in the bottom
floor of Parmly Hall. It is not
entirely coincidental that
Johnson’s room is isolated from
the rest of the university.

What makes Johnson unique
is that he was selected as a
Rhodes Scholar,.the first to be
chosen since 1977 and the 12th in
the hisotry of Washington and
Lee. Johnson, who is a senior
from Natchez, Ala., will earn
two degrees when he graduates
this year, one in physics and one
in mathematics.

“Don’t get me wrong, I have
nothing against the people in
the physics department,” said
Johnson,” this research set-up
is fine and the professors have
been terrific. But this school
has not been what I wanted it to
be.”

decision to attend Washington
and Lee was the result of apply-
ing to too many colleges and not
having any real advice on
where to go.

‘IT don’t believe I have found a
liberal education here,” said
Johnson. ‘‘I’m not sure if lama
confident student or if I am
even literate.”

Johnson chose to apply for the
scholarship in Alabama, where

Virginia law, the sentence for
statutory burglary can run
from one to 20 years.

Defense attorney Malcolm

Cash will be transported to a
state facility on Feb. 2, 1981.
However, before that time,
Cash will be under the supervi-

Parole time for Cash has not
been determined yet because of

No Thefts

by Tom Baker

Although students might have
come back to find bad grades or
cold weather, no one at
Washington and Lee came back
to find his dorm room, apart-
ment or fraternity house had
been broken into.

Charles Murray, the Univer-
sity Proctor, said that as of
Tuesday afternoon, no one had
been to see him to report a
break-in or theft.

Murray attributed the lack of
break-ins to several factors. As
he always does, Murray kept an
eye on the fraternity houses and
inspected them daily. Also,
many students took advantage

he felt he stood a better chance
to win. Ten people in Alabama
made the “‘first cut,’’ of which
two were chosen to attend the
regional finals in New Orleans.
Johnson found himself com-
peting against finalists from
Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkan-
sas, Texas and Oklahoma. Of
these 12 regional finalists, only
four were awarded scholar-
ships.

While he is attending Cam-
bridge University on his two-
year scholarship, Johnson plans
to study British science. After
his scholarship expires,
Johnson said he will ask for a
one-year extension so he can
complete a Phd. degree.

In contrast to his enthusiasm
over attending Cambridge,
Johnson said he has been disap-
pointed in his experiences at
W&L. Johnson also claimed
that the school’s research

that 10 years was a fair punish-
ment for the crime involved.

And while most Washington
and Lee students were taking
finals or heading home early
the week before Christmas,
Lexington police were busy
dealing with several incidents
of vandalism.

On Dec. 17 Dale Sutton,
manager of Adair-Hutton
Department Store, reported
that a leather coat was missing
from the store. He valued the
coat at $225.

Robert S. Culpepper, and
threatened with a stay in the

Murray, who felt that the new

Drunk Driver Hit Walking Home

On January 5 Los Angeles
police told a man to walk home
because he was too intoxicated
to drive. The man was injured
ina freak accident when he was
hit by a riderless motorcycle,
say police.

The 24-year-old man _ was
riding in a car with a friend
over the weekend when police
stopped them and cited the
driver for drunken driving. The
driver, who was not identified,
was taken away in a squad car,

but officers let Bryan go after
telling him he was too drunk to
drive and would have to walk
home.

A police officer said the
drunken driver turned into a
victim while he was taking his
belongings out of the car — a
driverless motorcycle hit him.
The motorcycle’s driver had
been thrown off moments
before in an unrelated accident.
Bryan was treated for injuries
at a local hospital and released.

Science Foundation Awards
Research Grant To Jarrard

 

L.E. JARRARD

Leonard E. Jarrard, head of
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s psychology department,
has received a $97,000 research
grant from the National Science
Foundation to continue his in- .
vestigations into a segment of
the brain known as the hip-
pocampus that is associated
with disorders including epilep-
sy.

Dr. Jarrard’s research on the
hippocampus has been sup-
ported by the NSF continuously
since 1966, and its grants to him
now total more than a third of a
million dollars.

The hippocampus, which
derives: its name from _ its
seahorse shape, was earlier
believed to be associated chief-
ly with memory, and some of
Jarrard’s research continues to
explore this involvement.

More recently, however, its
connection with serious
disorders, including hyperac-

tivity as well as epilepsy, has
become a central focus of scien-
tific investigation, including
that of Jarrard — who has
become one of the foremost
authorities in the field.

Recent studies have shown
that the hippocampus can be
damaged by lead in the air and
in drinking water — and also by
the drug Valium consumed dur-
ing formative years or by a
mother during her pregnancy.

- Jarrard uses specially bred
laboratory rats for his ex-
perimentation. His research
results with those specimens
have been borne out by subse-
quent studies undertaken by
other scientists on other
animals, including humans.

One of his new research
techniques employs a natural
chemical substance, kanic acid,
derived from a_ variety of
seaweed found off the cost of
Japan. Kanic acid allows lab
researchers to affect specific
parts of neurons (nerve cells) in
the hippocampus with much
more precision than previously
had been possible, and ex-
periments can therefore be
monitored and controlled with
greater accuracy.

An effect of kanic acid is that

- itis likely to induce an epileptic

seizure in a lab rat. But the
research has shown that the
same Valium that can damage
the hippocampus of a baby rat
may paradoxically relieve the
symptoms of epilepsy caused
by the kanic acid.

In his hippocampus work,
Jarrard is assisted by W&L
undergraduates, both through
the NSF grant and through the
university’s own Robert E. Lee
Research Program, created 20
years ago by a $250,000 gift from
an 1899 alumnus, the late Dr.
Gustavus Benz Capito of
Charleston, W.Va.

His research has generated
attention beyond the NSF; the
Environmental Protection
Agency is deeply interested in
his studies of the effects of lead
absorbed into the brain, and the
pharmaceutical firm that
manufactures Valium is supply-
ing that drug for his Valium-
based line of lab experimenta-
tion.

He has written three dozen
scholarly articles and delivered
a number of research papers to
conferences of his fellow
psychological researchers, in-
cluding an_ international
meeting last year sponsored by
the National Institute of Mental
Health.

Jarrard has taught at
Washington and Lee since 1959,
when he received his Ph.D.
from Carnegie-Mellon Universi-
ty in Pittsburgh, with the excep-
tion of five years from 1966 to
1970 when he returned to
Carnegie-Mellon, spending the
last three years there as chair-
man of the graduate program in
psychology. He returned to
W&L largely, he said, because
he missed having routine con-
tact with undergraduates.

Herreshoff Show Opens

by John Wells

Who was Louise Herreshoff,
and why are her paintings on
display in duPont Gallery?

She was a New York-born ar-
tist of considerable talent who
studied in Europe, lived in
Paris at the turn of the century
when it was the art center of the
world, and who stopped pain-
ting in 1927. In 1941 she married
a Washington and Lee Law
graduate, Euchlin D. Reeves,
who was 28 years her junior.
Upon their deaths in 1967, their
extensive porcelain collection
and her paintings were given to
the university.

One hundred years after her
birth, in the fall of 1976, an ex-
hibition entitled “Louise Her-
reshoff: An American Artist
Discovered’’ went on display at
the Corcoran Gallery of Art in

 

Washington, D.C. The exhibit is
currently being shown in du-
Pont until the end of the month.

It is indeed a show to see, an
impressive blend of styles from
the early 20th century. The ear-
ly works, portraits, reflect a
classical style attained when
Herreshoff studied under plein-
air artist Raphael Collin. This
influence continued when she
moved to Paris in 1898.

She returned to New York in
1903 displaying a passion for
color in her work. She painted
landscapes and still lifes ‘‘that
might well have been exhibited
next to the best of the Expres-
sionists in the Armory Show of
1913,” according to Norman
Hirschl or Hirsch] & Adler
Galleries in New York City. .

Herreshoff was extremely
devoted to a maiden aunt,

Aunt Lizzie, No. 2, 1926, Oil on Canvas.

Elizabeth, with whom she lived
for 15 years beginning in 1911.
When the aunt died in 1927, she
quit painting altoether and had
most of her canvasses put away
in the attic. The paintings were
brought to W&L along with the
barrels of bequeathed porcelain
in 1967.

The paintings, brightly col-
ored with bold strokes, are
enhanced by some _ personal
possessions of Herreshoff also
on display, including some fur-
nishings and a number of fami-
ly photographs. The newly-
refurbished gallery provides a
quietly posh setting for the
works, which are arranged in
chronological order.

It is a stunning exhibit; du-
Pont has begun the new year
with a burst of brilliance from
the past.

Commentary

 

by Ralph Frasca

Fans who attended the
basketball game against Rhode
Island College two nights ago
witnessed what could only be
described a romp. W&L simply
rolled over the Anchormen,
dealing them a 92-57 pasting.
However, this blow-out was dif-
ferent from the usual blow-out
in that the game was not a
debasing, circus-like humilia-
tion that one normally
associates with 35-point vic-
tories. Neither team played as
though the contest were one-
sided; the Generals merely ac-
cumulated the hoops in a very
patient and deliberate manner.

Head Coach Verne Canfield
has seen fit to employ a very
methodical and structured style
of play on his team, as opposed
to run-and-gun, razzle-dazzle
tactics demonstrated by not on-
ly Rhode Island, but a number
of W&L foes. Canfield obviously
believes in disciplined play, and
it works — witness the team’s

6-3 record. :
his penchant for structure is

most evident in the team’s
defense. Their 2-3 zone deserves

a kudos for its fine mobility, like

so many pseudopods of an
amoeba (how do you like that
analogy, Biology depart-
ment?). As is the case in so
many contests, Rhode Island
lost the game underneath the
boards. Rob Smitherman and
Brian Hanson shut off the key,
and the Anchormen found
themselves forcing outside
shots and trying to plow through
the wall of bodies for layups,
neither of which proved suc-
cessful. And it certainly doesn’t
hurt the Generals to have six
men over 6’3’’, while Rhode
Island had only one.

Yet another reason for the
staggering triumph was the
bench. When Canfield went to
his subs he found no lack of
talent. Freshman John Graves
demonstrated some sharp (six
for six) free-throw shooting,
while classmate Bill Yates ex-
ploded for seven quick points in
only a few minutes of playing
time. Ken Jaffe demonstrated
some aggressive defense, and
Clark New chipped in with ten
points. However, as is often the
case, Carby Hoy and Rok
Smitherman earned game
honors. Hoy netted 20 points
with some lethal outside
shooting, while Smitherman us
ed his picture-perfect shot t
score 11.

The Generals now embark on
a lengthy homestand, playing
six more times in the friendly
confines of Warner Gym before
taking to the road once again. I
heartily suggest that you check
out a basketball game, such as
the W&L Invitational Tourna-
ment on tap tomorrow and
Saturday.

Nunley Wins Scholarship

Lonnie D. “‘Chip’’ Nunley, a
Washington and Lee Universiny
senior from Bristol, Va. and a
three-year W&L football letter-:
man, has received a $2000
NCAA Post-Graduate Scholar-
ship.

Nunley is one of 33 college
football players from across the
nation to earn the scholarship
this year. He is the ninth W&L
student-athlete and sixth foot-
ball player to win the award,
which was first offered during
the 1964-65 academic year.

The 6-3, 220-pound Nunley
was a three-year starter at of-
fensive tackle, where he earned
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference (ODAC) first-team
honors his junior and senior
years. He has also earned three
varsity letters for W&L track.

An English and politics ma-
jor, Nunley carries a 3.36 grade
point average. He is a member
of Omicron Kappa Delta, the
national honorary leadership
fraternity founded at W&L in
1914, and the Phi Kappa Psi
social fraternity. He serves as
vice president of the Inter-

Fraternity Council and as an
assistant head dorm counselor.

With the 1980 portion of the
season complete, the

Washington and Lee wrestling
team doesn’t have any resolu-
tions for the new year. What it
does hope to accomplish in the
second half is to take every ad-
vantage of the experience ob-
tained in the first four meets.

The emphasis for most team
members at this point remains
to gain valuable mat experience
against its competition. With 70
percent of the squad made up of
newcomers, the Generals are
eager to improve on their 1-2
dual meet record and to recover
from a 41-9 loss to VMI in their
last meet before the Christmas
break.

Head coach Gary Franke sees
no reason to panic, particularly
with less than a third of the
schedule complete. ‘“‘We’ve got
good athletes, ones who will

achieve individual success as
the season moves along. And as
they earn it, we’ll see team suc-
cess.”’

Coach Franke is quick to
point out the caliber of W&L’s
competition in its previous
meets. “We hope that as a
result of having taken on Divi-
sion I an II teams, our guys can
learn and prepare for the rest of
the season.’ The competition
doesn’t get any easier for W&L,
at least not in the near future.
The Generals host both Duke
and Campbell College of North
Carolina in Warner Center this
Saturday at 1:30. The following
Wednesday, the Generals will
host New Jersey’s Glassboro
State College at 7:30. All three
schools have strong reputations
and should prove to be a
challenge for the Generals.

From the injury list comes
both good and bad news. The

latter is that freshman Richard
Kopelman (134) is out with a
foot infection. Sophomore Ray
Houlihan will take his place.
The former is that junior cap-
tain Mike McFadden (158) will
be able to return to action for
the first time in more than a
year; however, he will have to
earn his way onto the roster by
beating out freshman Tim
Valliere, who is currently the
starter in the 158-pound class.

Cagers Win Three, Drop One Swimmers Excel

by Dale Park

“We gave a good, solid team
effort on both ends of the
court,” stated W&L varsity
basketball coach Verne Can-
field after watching his team
crush visiting Rhode Island Col-
lege, 92-57.

Against Rhode Island, the
Generals were never threaten-
ed. After leading by only 12
points (39-27) at the half, the
W&L offense erupted in the se-
cond half to put away the An-
chormen.

Leading the Generals was co-
captain Carby Hoy. The senior
guard had his best game so far
this season, regaining his
shooting touch and going 10 of 14
from the field for a team-high 20
points.

The Generals’ balanced scor-
ing attack included six players
in double figures. Senior co-
captain R.J. Scaggs, a forward,
scored 12 points while his
classmate, center Rob Smither-
man, netted 11.

Junior guard George Spears,
the team’s leading scorer, con-
tributed: 10 points, while. the
final member of the starting
five, sophomore forward Brian
Hanson, scored six points.

The W&L bench provided a

big 20-point effort from two

players: both junior guard
Clark New and freshman for-
ward John Graves scored ten
points each.

“We accepted the fact that we’

have been playing under our
potential,”” commented Can-
field, ‘‘and against Rhode
Island we took one step toward
that potential.’’

Offensively, at least, the
' Rhode Island game compared
to the Generals’ surprising
108-104 win over Alderson-
Broaddus earlier in the season.

Said Canfield: ‘‘The
Alderson-Broaddus game was
obviously one of the best games
we've ever played here. They
full-court pressed us the whole
game and that tends to open

 

step with the quick A-B team,
and regulation play ended in a
98-all tie.

The score was again tied at
104-all with 1:42 left in the over-
time period, when George
Spears took control of the game.

Spears scored on an 18-foot
jumper with only seconds re-
maining as the Generals pulled

‘in front, 106-104. A-B, although

having no time-outs remaining,
called one anyway, resulting in
a teachnical foul. Spears then
iced the game with two free
throws.

“This team has the potential
to score big,’’ explained Can-
field. Hanson, Spears and Hoy
all scored 20 points apiece,
followed by Smitherman with
16, Scaggs with 13 and New with
10.

On Jan. 2-3, W&L competed in
the Washington & Jefferson
Tournamnent.

In the opening round, W&L
faced Rochester (ranked ninth
in the latest Division III poll
with a 10-0 record). Although
the Generals led by five points,
35-30, at the half, a poor
shooting performance in the se-
cond half, combined with 64 per-
cent shooting by Rochester,
resulted in the 82-68 loss.

George Spears drives against Rhode Island.

follow-up shots — both high
precentage types of shots.”’

None of W&L’s starting five
shot 50 percent from the field,
with Smitherman ‘and Spears
leading the scoring with 11 and
12 points, respectively.

In the consolation game
against Washington & Jeffer-
son, the Generals corrected
their problems from the night
before, scoring ten times on
easy lay-ups from the defense,
and coasting to an 84-66 victory.

Leading W&L was Scaggs
with 16 points. Other big scorers
wereSpears, who contributed 14
points, and Smitherman, who
chipped in 12.

The Generals have now won
three of their last four games.
Yet, as Canfield explained, ‘We
are still looking for consistency,
to avoid mental lapses which
cause us to lose the ball. Each
game is a step toward our
potential.”’

 

Although the NCAA Division
III Swimming Championship
meet is a full two months away,
Washington and Lee University
can already count on represen-
tation in six events thanks to
fine performances turned in at
the Virginia State Champion-
ships, which took place Dec. 4-6
at the University of Virginia.

Mike Bernote, a junior from
Hampton, Va. qualified for the
NCAA Nationals in the 50, 100,
and 200-yard freestyle events.
Bernot swam the 50-yard event
in 21:88 seconds (the qualifying
standard is 21:99), swam the 100
in 47:69 seconds (qualifying is
47:99), and the 200 in 1:45.74
minutes (qualifying is 1:46.78).

Tim Rock, a freshman from
San Antonio, Texas, beat the
qualifying time in two events.
He turned in a 4:47.23 clocking
in the 500-yard freestyle event
(qualifying is 4:51.4) and a
16:17.27 time in the 1650-yard
freestyle (qualifying is
17:03.59). His mark in the 1650
was 1.2 seconds off the W&L
school record.

The sixth event in which W&L
qualified was the 400-yard
freestyle relay. Herb Gresens,
Rob Crawford, Kevin Becker,
and Bernot teamed for a 3:15.90
showing (qualifying mark is
3:16.35).

‘These performances are the
best I’ve ever had a team swim
so early in the year,’’ remarked
head coach Page Remillard.
‘‘We often shoot for the moon
and are happy to reach most
anywhere out in space. This
time we shot the moon and
reached a few stars, too.

“I’m. pleased for our swim-

mers,’ the second-year direc-
tor’ continued. ‘‘When you get
new swimmers like Rock,
Crawford, Becker, into a new
school and with a new coach,
good performances like these
show they can attain goals
quickly. As for upperclassmen
like Bernot and Gresens, it
shows they can continue to set
and attain goals.

“In addition to the qualifying
times, I’m pleased that our top
performances came from some
of our top academic swim-
mers,’’ Remillard offered,
referring to Bernot, Crawford,
and Gresens.

The State Championship
event was W&L’s final listing on
the 1980 portion of the schedule,
during which the team also
compiled a 1-1 dual meet
record. Swimming against
Richmond and VMI in the
season-opener at W&L on Nov.
19 the Generals won over VMI
78-34. while bowing to the
Spiders 76-37. Crawford, a
sophomore from Ft. Walton
Beach, Fla., provided a pair of
highlights by setting W&L
records in the 200-yard in-
dividual medley event (2:03.95
to break a 1978 mark of 2:05.10)
and in the 100-yard breaststroke
(1:03.56 to break a 1962 mark of
1:04.40).

Over the holiday break, the
Generals will travel to San An-
tonio, Texas for a series of prac-
tices. Dates for the trip are Dec.
26 through Jan. 4. W&L will
resume its regular schedule on
Jan. 9 at home against George
Washington. The NCAA meet
will be held March 19-21 at
Oberlin (Ohio) College.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The Right Direction

The cliche no news is good news certainly applies to
Lexington’s current crime problem.That no student
residence burglaries were reported over the winter
break is remarkable considering last semester’s in-
crease of crime in various categories. It is interesting
to note that the vacation break-in problem seemed to
find a quick and simple solution — the action taken
against local juveniles by Judge Robert S. Culpepper.
We applaud Judge Culpepper’s efforts to curb
juvenile involvement in local crime. No doubt the
University did some effective prodding in this matter,
but Culpepper’s work in this area seems noteworthy.
When Charles Murray, alias ‘Murph’, our school
proctor, says someone makes a difference in stopping
crime, you know that person is on the ball. Murph
says Culpepper makes a difference (see ‘‘No Thefts
Over Break”’ page 1), and we thank Mr. Culpepper for
working so well on the juvenile crime problem.

But private business and initiative also seemed to
contribe to Washington and Lee’s rescue from crime.
Specifically, a local entrepeneur named James Watt
started a storage service and promised to provide
safe storage for student valuables year-round for a
nominal fee. And should anyone decide to burglarize a
house, they have to realize the consequences of facing
Judge Rudolph Bumgardner — the judge who handed
down a stiff penalty in the Phi Kappa Sigma burglary
case. We think Commonwealth’s Attorney Beverly C.
‘‘John”’ Read did a good job in prosecuting the state’s
case against the Phi Kap Prowler and Judge
Bumgardner did an excellent job of choosing a
sentence for the defendent. We hope both judges and
the prosecuting attorney keep up the good work and
put an end to the crime problem in Lexington.

Drop-ad slips. An institution of the first week of the new term.

Letters

Editor

 

 

Senior Pictures Explained

Dear Editor:

There is, with good reason,
some confusion among the
senior class concerning por-
traits for the CALYX. On behalf
of myself and Editors Peter
Eliades and Parker Roberts, I’d
like to clear up as much of this
confusion as possible. As of the
just-ended (and, as always, too
short) vacation, about 185
seniors had been photographed.
Many of you have justly been
curious about seeing the proofs
of your portraits. Well, this will
happen next week. Proofs will
be available for viewing in the
CALYX Office (Student Center
Room 200) from Monday,
January 12 through Thursday,
January 15, between 7:00 and
8:30 in the evenings. If you want
to purchase prints of your por-
traits, you can do so then.

About the other 100 or so of
you in the senior class who
haven’t been photographed yet:
this can still be done. I am going
to do one more week of
shooting, Monday, January 12
through Friday, January 16.

Sign yourself up in the schedul-
ing book in the co-op. There is a
$2 late fee, bringing the total
cost of your portrait to $10.
Why? Because you had all of
October, November and part of
December to get it together and
you didn’t do it. The CALYX:

staff (and myself) have other, .

things we need to be doing and
that makes this ‘make-up’ work
a hassle. So it costs you more
money since it costs us more
time.
Some of you have decided to
submit portraits of your own do-
ing or pictures shot by friends.
That’s fine, as long as the print
you turn in is in black and white’
and of sufficient quality to
reproduce satisfactorily. If this
is what you’re going to do, you
should have the print turned in
by Friday, January 16. Do this
during the proof showing hours,
since you'll need to fill out a
senior information sheet too.
Some of you seem to have the
impression that turning in your
own portrait will exempt you

from the $8 fee. Not so. Repeat:
not so. The cost is the same no
matter who does your photo.
From the standpoint of finance
(which is the reason nobody is
exempt from the $8 fee) the
CALYX will be just as happy if
you do turn in your own por-
trait, since they’ll get the $8
without having to pay me for
shooting you. And, frankly, I’ve
got enough work to do already,
so I won’t mind not
photographing any of you who
do want to submit your own
stuff. On the other hand, either
way, you’re shelling out the
bucks, so it won’t cost you any
more to have me photograph
you too...

Whatever, I’m ready when
you are. Overall, the Class of
1981 has been the most pleasant
Class of the 6 Senior Classes
I’ve photographed here, and I
thank you, Gentlemen, for your
civility and hospitality.

Sincerely,
W. Patrick Hinely, ’73
University Photographer

drop/add route, I found out that
my advisor had gone skiiing. No
dice. I received the Ax’s lecture
with all the excitement of a mid-
night phone call from Bob
Willis. And the only course I
needed to graduate meets GH —
effectively cutting into the first
quarter of General Hospital —
the segment
Baldwin looks good.

My favorite video game has
been moved and the same goose
who was hogging the Galaxian
machine when I left is still there
— this time with an eight-inch
stack of quarters. Things got

where Laura —

even worse at the post office. I
couldn’t find my key and the
check from my father was sit-
ting inside the box. So was a
four-inch thick letter from
CenTel — hardly a Christmas
card,

With my mind zonked and my
nerves frayed I turned to the
last resort — the ABC store.
And what did I find out, only
that the damn store is being
moved down the road, effective-
ly preventing a between-classes
sprint. There is one consolation
— the new store will be larger
and self-service. But it. still
won’t have a drive-thru win-
dow, or will it?

There's no Monday night foot-
ball but there was a special 60
Minutes program. I looked on to
see Dan Rather interviewing
my father. I couldn’t watch
after they got to the part about
income tax evasion. My alma
mater was left out of this year’s
favorite stocking stuffer. I settl-
ed down to read my favorite
book — The Painted Bird.

Another day in the life.

gram was to inform him of being

awarded the Fellowship.

Mollenhotf said the award
was a Surprise. ‘It’s the Hall of

ferent from most of his other
(numerous) awards. This
award falls into the category of
the Eisenhower Exchange

1960; the University of Arizona,
John Peter Zenger Award he

received in 1962; and the
University of Kansas, Allen-

1964. He said the similarity lies
in that ‘‘you don’t have any idea
you are even being considered
for the award.”’ There are no
publicly announced entries or

Johnson Discusses W&L

(continued from page 1)

available to every student at
W&L.

“It seems as if this school is
violently opposed to research,
Johnson said adding that ‘at
times, this school seems to go
out of its way to prevent a stu-
dent form doing research.”

This schortcoming of the
school, in Johnson’s opinion, in
allowing students to perform
research is a major factor in his
disenchantment. Johnson
believes, in fact, that his first
bad experience with W&L dates
back to when he was applyi for
admission to the school.

“T feel that I was lied to dur-
ing my (admissions) interview
when I asked about what frater-
nities do to a student,’’ claimed
Johnson. ‘‘All I got were glossy
answers, Still, I tried to go
through rush open-minded.”’

Johnson said that he lost all
respect for the fraternity
system early into the rush pro-
gram. “People don’t realize
that the only friends you make
in fraternities are social ones,”
stated Johnson. ‘‘The average
friend in a fraternity is ar-
tificial; he has no idea what you
have done or what you're do-
ing.”

Johnson was not entirely der-
rogatory of W&L’s social life, as
he declared that W&L “‘is the
best school I know ef to get laid.
By the end of the week everyone
is horny.”

Johnson believes, however,
that W&L has caused him to
have difficulty in working with
women. “It’s hard for me to
talk professionally to a woman
unless I’ve danced with her
first,’ claimed Johnson. “I
have never met a woman here

who has understood my
studies.”
The best solution for

Washington and Lee, Johnson
believes, is to drop the all-male
concept of enrollment and allow
women to attend the college.
Along with admitting women,
Johnson believes W&L should
increase tuition, so that more
research equipment can be pur-
chased.

“Basically, Washington and
Lee University is a boys’ high
school with nice facilities and
bright teachers’’’ said Johnson.
“But this school will never be
more than boys’ high school
unless some changes are
made.”

‘‘As far as I understand, both
the student body and the faculty
are in favor of coeducation,”’
continued Johnson, ‘‘ but the
board of trustees is against it.
All I know is that-it could be
money better spent.”’

And if he had to do it all again,
Johnson said he definitely
would not return to W&L. “I
probably would go to the Naval
Academy,’ said Johnson.
‘There are so few people here
you can talk to about physics.”

you are working on.’ It is possi-
ble to luck into a story situation
where what you’ve done on an
individual case is as much luck
as it is your talent,”’ he said.
Mollenhoff explained,
however, that the award is bas-
ed on the test of time and en-
durance of one’s overall
business record. It is never
given for one exceptional story.
He noted that when he began his
journalistic career, it was

beyond what he tought possible

— even beyond the Pulitzer.
Asked if there is enough room

on the walls of his award-

Lexington-Buena Vista

covered office for yet another
award, Mollenhoff boomingly
chuckled, ‘‘there’s a little space
at the top.”

Mollenhoff joined W&L’s
journalism faculty in 1976, after
30 years on the staff of the Des
Moines Register and Tribune,
and also now teaches a seminar
on constitutional law and in-
vestigative reporting in W&L’s
law school. In addition he is the
author of 11 books, including the
recently released best-:

Nevertheless, as the honors
mount the work continues for
the tireless Mollenhoff. ‘I have
two or three ideas in mind for
more books,’’ he said, ‘‘All deal
with the press and government,
mis-management and corrup-
tion. Hopefully this summer
when I have some time, I’m
thinking in terms of doing one
on the comparision of England
and the United States in their
government versus press rela-
tions.”’
