Center tonight.

by John Wells

Washington and Lee’s 74th
Fancy Dress Weekend will be
launched tonight at 8 p.m. with
a performance by
singer/songwriter John Prine
in Warner Gymnasium.

Since his first album was
released a decade ago, Prine
has built a strong and loyal
following without relying on the
exposure afforded most pop
stars by AM radio. He has
developed a_ distinct style

out as an_ acoustic guitar-
playing folk singer and reaping

 

throughout his career, starting:

critical acclaim as he moved
closer to folk rock and eventual-
ly rock and roll.

In 1978, Prine’s album
Bruised Orange was cited by
Time magazine as one of the
year’s ten best, and his songs
have been recorded by such ar-
tists as Joan Baez and Bette
Midler. Critics have compared
Prine at various times to Bob
Dylan, Woody Guthrie and
Hank Williams.

Prine is a fine performer, and
his lyrics contain humor and
pathos. He should get the
weekend off to a good start.

 

 

Secretary Confronted In

McCormick Parking Lot
While Gas Is Siphoned

by Tom Baker

A member of the Washington
and Lee University staff was
threatened and the cars of three
students were vandalized in
what appear to be two related
incidents over W&L’s recent
break.

At approximately 6:15 p.m.
on Monday, February 16, a
secretary left her office in Mc-
Cormick Hall and began walk-
ing from the front door to the

Opposite end of the parking lot

next. to the Commerce School
where her car, the only staff car

in the parking lot at the time,

was parked.

Although it was dark, the
secretary saw two individuals
who were in the process of
siphoning gasoline from the

tank of her car. Upon making,

her presence known, the
secretary claimed ‘the two in-
dividuals ran to their car, a
metallic brown hatchback
parked next to the staff
member’s car. With the car’s
headlights beaming in her face,
the secretary said the would-be
siphoners drove up on to the
curb in front of her in an ap-
parent and successful effort to
frighten her.

After the individuals had
driven off, the secretary called
the police who then inspected

the car with the exception of a
missing gas cap, the car ap-
peared to be undamaged.

The secretary, who asked not
to be named, believes that
because her car was the only
one in the parking lot at the
time, the two individuals
assumed that it was a student’s
car and proceeded to siphon gas
from her car.

The secretary expressed her
concern about the lighting in the
parking lot by stating that the
lighting ‘‘doesn’t seem _ ade-
quate anywhere on campus as
far as I'm concerned.”

While she admitted that in-
creased lighting might not have
been necessary in the past

Journalism Department To Hold

by Dave Dallam

On Fri., Mar. 6, and Sat.,
Mar. 7, the Journalism Depart-
ment of Washington & Lee
University will sponsor a panel
discussion entitled ‘‘The
Presidential News Conference:
Problems and Promises.”’

Participants include such
distinguished journalists as Bill
Moyers, former
Secretary to Lyndon B. Johnson
and currently a commentator
for PBS, who will serve as
moderator. Ron Nessen, former
Press Secretary to President
Gerald Ford, Sam Donaldson,
White House Corrrespondent
for ABC News and Bill Plante,
White House Correspondent for
CBS News, will also attend.

Also featured will be Ray
Scherer, former White House
correspondent for NBC News
and currently vice-president of
the RCA Corporation and Frank
Cormier, White House Cor-
respondent for the Associated
Press. Clark Mollenhoff, pro-
fessor of journalism at

Press _

Washington & Lee, will also at-
tend.

The purpose of the discussion,
according to Mollenhoff, is to
determine the history and pur-
pose of the Presidential press
conference as an_ institution.
The panelists will discuss its
achievements and failures, as

 

well as what improvements can
be made.

The medium of the White
house press conference is not
and has not been a perfect
method of conveying a balanced
picture of administration
policy. Mollenhoff, a veteran of

to the Truman administration,
cites limited access of the press
to the President as a potential
problem of each imcoming ad-
ministration.

As administrations strive to
create viable new ideas for
orderly proceedings, they may
impose a decorum so stifling
that the President will be able
to control the questioning in
that he will call only on those
reporters who ask ‘‘softball’’
questions. ‘‘Softball’’ questions
are those which pose no real
danger to an administration.

Mollenhoff believes that this
problem can be avoided
through the creation of an en-
vironment in’ which
prevails, but also in which
reporters will be able to ask all
“relevant”? questions without
the threat of being censored.

The problems of access and
censorship are but two of many
aspects of the Presidential news
conference which will be
discussed by the panelists. The

On the previous Saturday,
three cars parked in the C lot
next to the practice football

two of the cars were vandalized.

One car had a_ window

ray Said he is currently in the
process of investigating all .
these incidents.

sessions should give the public
an indication of what im-
provements should be made in
this medium.

Sessions will be held in Lee

EC Confirms Whitebook Committee Trio

by W. Cope Moyers

The Executive Committee
received January financial
reports Monday night from two
university organizations, and
unanimously approved the con-
firmation of three members to
the White Book Revisions sub-
committee.

Pryse Elam, co-chairman of
the Student Activities Board,
reported that the estimated cost
of this year’s Fancy Dress is
about $36,000.00. However,
Elam warned that final figures

for this weekend’s big bash
could easily change since
original estimates were made
last month.

The SAB expects to spend
$8,700.00 for Thursday night
entertainment and $13,000.00 for
Friday night’s ball, according
to Elam. The largest expen-
ditures are’ for John Prine,
about $6,000.00, and the Peter
Duchin Bank that will play Fri-
day night. The SAB agreed to
pay the band $7,000.00. Close to
$9,000.00 is expected to be spent

for decorations, the board
estimates, with the largest cost
resulting from the actual
decoration of the Student
Center.

Elam said ‘“‘other’’ costs, 1n-
cluding security, beer and
publicity would come to about
$5,400.00. The SAB estimates

receipts for the ball at
$36,273.00, leaving the board
with a $183.00 profit.

Ariel also made its report to
the EC, reporting that it had
about $1,200.00 remaining of the

$2,000.00 originally allocated to
the student publication by the
committee for this year. The
deadline for students to submit
work for the spring issue is
March 24. The issue will be
distributed on May 22.

The Executive Committee
approved the confirmation of
senior Rob Brooke and third-
year law student Walter Kelley
to the subcommittee examining
possible revisions in the honor
system. Craig Cornett, assis-
tant director of publications and

a 1980 graduate of the universi-
ty, was also approved by the
committee.

EC member Jim Vines,
himself a member of the sub-
committee, reported that a
sophomore will probably fill the
only remaining vacancy on the
subcommittee. He said a choice
will be made soon.

Religion professor Louis
Hodges will also serve on the
subcommittee, Vines said,
which expects to make its
recommendation to the full EC
later this year.

Going Down The Road With Gas Going Up

by Bill Whalen

D.T.R. Headin’ down the
road.

It’s quite a simple proposition
when you consider it. All you
need is a car, three or four
friends, and enough gas to get
you there and back.

Finding enough willing part-
ners never seems to be a pro-
blem. You can usually find a
car if you look hard enough. The
only setback the average mink
might find in going down the
road is coming up with enough
money to pay for the gas.

Times were when the most
popular member of the fraterni-

 

ty house was the one with the
biggest car. Remember Animal
House and the infamous road
trip to Emily Dickinson Col-
lege? All the Delts needed were
enough beers to last the trip and
Flounder’s shiny new black
Continental.

But those times have come
and gone, and the budget-wise
road tripper of 1981 will find
himself making most of his
trips to Hollins or Sweet Briar
crammed in the back of a four-
cylindered import. The major
reason for this? Gas, of course.

Since 1973, gas has increased
almost 500 percent in the city of

HIGH GAS PRICES make filling up an unpleasant experience.

Lexington. Where the price of a
gallon of gasoline once was
25-30 cents, the current prices
are hovering near the $1.50
mark.

One victim of the spriraling
cost of gasoline is Johnnie
Lynn, the proprietor of the
Texaco station located at the in-
tersection of Main St. and Rte.
60. Lynn, who has been in the
service station business for 24
years, is now considering sell-
ing his station.

“Prices are closing us down,”
said Lynn. “I’ve lost money
over the last four years and I
can’t last much longer.”’

For Lynn, the major problem
is one of making enough gross
profit off the sale of each
gallon of gasoline. According to
Lynn, a small-time service sta-
tion owner must make at least a
10-percent gross profit on each
gallon to stay afloat.

Currently, Lynn makes only a
seven-percent gross profit off
the sale of each gallon of gas.
And compounded with the costs
of maintaining the station, Lynn
finds himslef running in the red.

“I buy my gas from a Texaco
direct dealer for $1.29.7 gallon
and sell it at $1.39,” said Lynn.
“That means I make about ten
cents on a gallon, but not ten
percent.”’

$1.39 represents the cost of a
gallon of Texaco regular gas.
Lynn’s unleaded stock runs as
high as $1.49 per gallon. When
considered into road trip ex-
penses, this has devastating
results.

If one were to drive the
Animal House Continental
from Lexington to Hollins and
back for a month, the cost

would drive most students to
the poor house, if not the Cold
Check Committee. If the Con-
tinental got 15 miles per gallon
on the highway, for example
and a round trip from Lexington
to Hollins is approximately 100
miles, then the average road
trip would cost almost $10. Four
or more road trips a month
would probably be more than
the average student could
handle.

Johnnie Lynn sees two ob-
jects which help W&L students
through this period, however.
One is the small car. The other
is the gasoline credit card.

“A majority of the students
who come in here have credit
cards,” said Lynn, ‘‘so I guess
Daddy pays and they don’t real-
ly care about the cost.’’ I’ve

also noticed some students have
cut down.”

Lynn considers Lexington’s
college students his ‘‘lifeline”’
during the winter months. Still,
he notes that not enough gas is
being bought to make a profit.

Lynn therefore sees only two
alternatives for himself. One is
to increase the volume of
available gasoline in hopes of
getting more revenue. The
other is selling out.

‘“‘There’s no real demand for
gas right now,’’ said Lynn, ‘‘so
my only choice is to sell.”

Unfortunately for consumers,
their only choice is to buy — and
buy at prices which never seem
to stop rising. This is the dilem-
ma of the road tripper. It is also
a problem which we may have
to live with for a long time.

Gloom. Darkness. The

gnashing of teeth. Yes, its that ;

time again: Santa Pinter is
back in town, spreading cheer
and merriment.

This year, Homer Bliss’
senior thesis production was
Happy Harry Pinter’s ‘‘The
Dumbwaiter.’’ Twice. In one
night. For three consecutive
evenings, yet. I cannot fault the
choice, the direction, or the pro-
duction; just for the record,
though, a rainy night without
dinner is bad enough without
{two hours of gloom. I just don’t
care for Pinter.

But if I did, I would have been
celebrating opening night. The
sets were just stark enough for
the tale: two semi-imbecilic:
British agents in a cellar during
WWII. The lighting was not so:
harsh as to gall the audience’

spots may have been too ob-
vious; but, opening night may

_well excuse that.

Dumbwaiter has _ beautiful ,
moments but awful quarter

hours (as Rossini said of
Wagner). Its pure Pinter
(more’s the pity): the

characters take their shoes on
and off and talk about death,
crockery, and toilets for half an
hour. Then one of ’em pulls a
gun (one step ahead of the
critic). It’s the sort of perfor-
mance you sit down to at six,
and when you look at your
watch three hours later, it’s six-
fifteen (Rossini again).

Last night was experimental
theatre, after all; you could tell,
because the seats were rickety.

but so are coffins; why-is ex-

perimental theatre so often un-
comfortable theatre? Even the
program _was_ experimental.
(‘‘Washington and Lee...’ spell-
ing reform.in the Bernard Shaw
tradition). So, they presented
two different interpretations of
Dumbwaiter. Whimper.

The serious side was taken in
the first production, which
made the House of Usher look
like a Pavilion party. Lee Clark

as the irascible and_high-
handed Ben was quite
workmanlike, and George

larossi whined most admirably.
Perhaps if her were a trifle less
staid...The performance’s sole
difficulty of any magnitude was
a lack of that tension that might
have made the transformation
from ennui to frenzy easier for
all of us.

After the first production the
stage was readied for an at-
tempt at ‘‘Pinter with a lighter
touch.’’ The effect of this was to
dilute clinical depression to
mere suicidal melancholy. This
may have been ill-conceived as
an attempt but it worked
moderately well. The staging
was, unfortunately, rather con-
trived in the second production,
as Gus is shunted to stage right;
a position inconsistent with ef-
fective handling of stage direc-
tions. Still, Ted Petrides carried

The Sky Touch Ground Here Tomorrow

Riders In The Sky is one ex-
cellent band, one that cannot be
categorized. While based in
Nashville, Riders is not simply
‘‘country;’’ they represent that
music’s one-time other half —
“‘Western music.”’ -

Back in the 1940’s there was a
thriving musical genre that

drew on traditional cowboy
ballads and the lovely melodies
created by commercial
songwriters for Hollywood’s
singing cowboy stars. These
singing cowboys were
categorized by romantic
imagery of the West and its
scenery, and by harmony

 

singing and yodeling un-
matched to this day. Many of
these became so popular that
even the young people of today
are aware of them — ‘“Tumbl-
ing Tumbleweeds,’’ ‘‘Cool
Water,” ‘Happy Trails (To

- You), “Back In The Saddle

Again,” being good examples.

What Riders In The Sky has
done is brought back these
golden treasures, added some
hot instrumentals and original
tunes, and dressed the whole
thing up. with some fancy
western duds, sets, and skits.

The group guru is Doug
Green, a strappin’, big ol’
Midwestern. boy with all the
charm of Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid combined. ‘‘The
Big Fella,’ as he’s called on
Stage, has been a_ respected
Nashville musician for some
time, having appeared with the
Father of Bluegrass, Bill
Monroe, and sung gospel with
Emmylou Harris’ last touring
partners and back-up singers,
Buck White and the Down Home
Folks.

You've probably also seen his
byline as one of Nashville’s
freelance writers in most of the

major country music
magazines. A stint as the Oral

Historian of the Country Music
Foundation Hall of Fame re-

acquainted him with the joys of
western music. So he looked
around town for some like-
minded pickers.

Songwriter, singer, and bass
player extraordinaire Fred
LaBour joined first. Fred,
known as “Too Slim’’ in the
band, contributed the wit that
characterizes the group’s
make-believe radio show per-
formances. He’d known some
songwriting success, but once
with Doug, he gleefully began
pillaging the repertoires of
Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, The
Sons of the Pioneers, The
Riders of the Purple Sage, and
his other cowboy heroes of days
gone by.

But the trio was not complete
until the addition of Woody Paul
(Chrisman), whom they im-
mediately dubbed ‘‘The King of
the Cowboy Fiddlers.” This
superb musician has fiddled
with such luminaries as Wilma
Lee Cooper, Joe Sun, and rock
stars Loggins and Messina, yet
it seems he found his true niche
with Riders In The Sky.

Generals Lose Last Games,

Play In ODAC Tourney

by Dale Park
As a wrap—up to their 1980-81
regular season schedule, the
Washington and Lee varsity
basketball team dropped their
last three games ina row.

All three games were in the
ODAC, and all three games
were on the road. As a result,
the Generals ended up with a 2-7
away game record for the
regular season and will enter
the the upcoming ODAC Cham-
pionship Tournament with a 7-7
league record. The ODAC Tour-
nament will be held in Salem,
Virginia, February 26-28.

On Saturday, February 14,
the Generals travelled to
Roanoke to take on the national-
ly ranked Maroons. Earlier in

the season, W&L had dealt
Roanoke their only loss of the
season in a 96-79 rout in Warner
Center.

Although the Generals
scrambled to a 29-27 halftime
lead, the Maroons full-court
pressure broke the back of
W&L’s backcourt, forcing 27
turnovers, as Roanoke powered
its way to a 75-64 win.

‘We didn’t work against the
press as effectively as we did in
the first game,’’ remarked head
coach Verne Canfield. ‘‘I have
no idea why we. didn’t.
Sometimes our team lacks men-
tal toughness when it is backed
into a corner.”’

with 14 points, while classmate
Rob Smitherman, at center,
contributed 12 points. Junior
forward Clark New chipped in
11, and sophomore forward
Brian Hanson added 10 points
and grabbed 11 rebounds.

Tuesday, February 17, found
the Generals facing the Eastern
Mennonite Royals, one of only
two teams to hand W&L a loss
at home all season. Mennonite
was able to do the same on its
own court, with a 90-81 victory
over the Generals. Smitherman
paced his team with 20 points
and fourteen rebounds. In the
game, Smitherman topped the
1,000 point mark for his career.
Only ten other players in the
history of W&L basketball have
ever achieved this goal.

“Rob (Smitherman) has
worked the hardest to achieve
the 1,000 point goal and is one of
the most deserving to attain it.”
commented Canfield.

Following Smitherman were
Hanson and New, who scored 12
points apiece, and junior guard
George Spears, who added 11
points.

The Mennonite loss marked
the second time in two years
that the Royals have defeated
W&L in both regular season
games.

The Generals topped off their
away-game frustrations on Fri-
day, February 20, in a 78-67
final game loss to the Maryville
Scots. W&L’s shooting percen-
tage from the floor, erratic all
season, dropped to 43 percent
for the night.

Freshman forward, John
Graves, ina starting role for the
sixth time this season, lead his
team with 16 points. Graves had
been instrumental in W&L’s
final home game of the season,
a 92-69 victory over Mary
Washington back on February

12.

At home, the Generals fin-
ished with a 14-2 mark; overall,
W&L compiled a 16-9 record.

Canfield maintained that his
team should not have lost as
many games as it did, espec-
ially in the ODAC. Offered Can-
field, ‘‘I am disappointed in this
team. Our problem is not a mat-
ter of execution, it is a matter of
mental preparation and adjust-
ment for a particular game.”’

In last year’s ODAC Tourna-
ment, W&L entered with a 5-5
league record and a_ fourth
place seed (out of six teams),
and by virtue of three im-
pressive victories, won the tour-
nament.

This year the Generals will
face an expanded tournament
schedule in their bid to repeat
last year’s performance
(Roanoke and Maryville are
now eligible to compete for the
ODAC title).

More teams may be the least
of the Generals’ worries. Can-
field conceded that ‘‘last year,
we had pride and a season filled
with emotion. This season
we've had nothing like that —
nothing to bind us together. Our
players are not able to react to
every game situation, whether
it is a bad call, etc. If I knew
what the key was to bring the
team together, I would use it,
but as of right now, I don’t.”

Crawford Breaks Records To

Qualify For Championships

by Philip Murray

Rob Crawford set three
school records at the UNC-
Wilmington Invitational last
weekend, as a number of
outstanding individual _ per-
formances were turned in by
the W&L swimmers.

The junior transfer from Ft.
Walton Beach, Florida is now
beginning to live up to Coach
Page Remillard’s expectation

Crawford’s time of 1:00.95 in
the 100 yard breaststroke event,
broke the oldest record in the
W&L books, set in 1962 by Elliot
Maynard, at 1:04.40. That time
was also good enough for
Crawford to place first in that
event in the overall competi-
tion.

In the 200 yard breast,
Crawford finished fourth, but
set a new school record in the

preliminaries at 2:15.95. The old

record stood at .2:19.50.

Finally Crawford smashed
his own record in the 200-yard
individual medley by nearly

school record in the first meet
of the season at 2:03.95.
Crawford's times in all three
events qualified him for the
NCAA Division III champion-

Generals have _ previously
qualified for the competition.

at 3:43.117, breaking the 1979
mark of 3:44.20.

Another noteworthy _ per-
formance came from freshman
Jeff Gee. In addition to his con-
tribution on the relay team, Gee
posted personal best times in
the 200-yard backstroke and the
100-yard butterfly events.

Coach Remillard was _ ob-
viously pleased with the perfor-
mance of the team. A lack of
depth on the team forced the
coach to gear his training
toward the invitationals and in-
dividual efforts rather than
team competition. This tactic is
certainly paying off well for the
Generals now.

Herb Gresens will take part in

ing weekend for its final swim

Jones Takes
Positive View

by Todd Barstow

If this year’s baseball
Generals play as well as new
head Coach Craig Jones
believes they will, the
Washington & Lee 9 could be
headed for a very successful
spring. Jones, who was picked
unexpectedly by Athletic Direc-
tor William McHenry to head
the program, is a very positive
young man who appears to en-
joy his new position. His selec-
tion, he said, came as
something of a surprise to him
— he had expected to be only an
assistant to former head coach
Chuck Kroll.

The new skipper is happy for
two reasons: the atmosphere at
the school and the talent that he
sees on this year’s squad.

Jones feels that the ball

. players are more enthusiastic

since none of them are on
athletic scholarships. While he
sees nothing wrong. with
athletic scholarships, he does
believe that they are the ‘‘bot-
tom line.’’ He comments: ‘An
amateur is someone who plays
for the love of the sport.”

It will take more than en-
thusiasm to win baseball games
this spring, however, and Jones
is also excited about the talent
he sees developing, especially
with the numerous newcomers
to the dugout.

Defense will be stressed this
season. The outfield is especial-
ly strong and junior co-captain
and All-American center fielder
Thad Ellis comments: ‘‘this is
the first year we've had a solid
(defensive) outfield.’ Starting
will be Jody Harris in left, Ellis
in center, and junior transfer
Don Dudley in right.

Dudley is a former Lexington

High standout who, according
to local observors, has a
tremendous throwing arm.

The infield is also solid, with
sophomore Chris Cavalline at
short, freshman Kevin Golden
at -second,: and <untor
Jeff Haggerty at third. First
base is still open.

Right hander Dave Randall
and portsider Marty Thomas
are expected to anchor the
pitching staff.

Jones is firmly convinced that
pitching is essential for the suc-
cess of the team. The coach is
looking for consistent pitchers
who will get men out regularly.
Jones says that college ball is
demanding on pitchers, who
often have little time to prepare
themselves for the season.
Jones has been impressed by
the many new arms on the
squad, however.

Overall, Jones is impressed
by the hard work and the self-
discipline of the players. He
plans to use the individual
talents of each player as possi-
ble in the years’ games. The
starting lineup is not absolute.
Jones will play those who are
producing at the plate as well as
in the field.

Jones anticipates a successful
season if the pitching and hit-
ting develop as he hopes they
will. One problem in recent
years, offers Ellis, has been the
team’s attitude after the Easte -
break. Pitchers often lose their
timing; hitters have the same
problem. The team’s winning
attitude is often lost during the
pressure of exam week.

All in all, the 1981 diamond
stars are looking forward with
eagerness to a_ successful
season.

Track Team Slowed

In Lynchburg

by Rick Swagler
The W&L indoor track team

 

finished fifth at the Lynchburg
Relays on Saturday the 2ist.
This accomplishment was
somehow dimmed, though, by

| the fact that only five teams

participated. Coach Norris
Aldridge first said that he ‘‘was
a little disappointed’’ but upon
further consideration, he com-
mented that he ‘‘wasn’t disap-
pointed” with the individual
performances but the guys
‘didn’t perform well as a
team.”

Individually for the Generals,
Bob Jenevein, Rob Brod, Billy
Morris, and Kevin Kadesky ran
the 440 relay and collected the
third place ribbon. The mile
relay team of Paul Champman,
Morris, Kadesky and Russ Rec-
tor ran for a fourth place finish.
Aldridge also praised Howard
Herndon and John Kelefant for
their performances in the
distance medley.

One interesting aspect of
W&L indoor track is the number
of events each athlete par-
ticipates in. Russ Rector, for
example, an _ aspiring
decathlete, ran in the 880 relay,
the sprint medley relay, the
mile relay, and would have run
in the shuttle relay had the
team not been disqualified for a
false start. In addition, Rector
participated in the long jump,
triple jump, high jump, and
Shot put. In fact, the only field
event he didn't participate in
was the pole vault. simularty,
Billy Morris ran the 440 relay,
mile relay, 880 relay, and sprint
medley relay.

In regard to the ODAC Cham-
pionship to be held Saturday at
Lynchburg, Aldridge com-
mented that the team ‘thas a
tendency to come back.”
Bridgewater College is favored
to win, with W&L and Lynch-
burg expected to fight it out for
second,

Wrestlers End Up-And-Down Season

With Two Consecutive Defeats

by John Harrison

The W&L wrestling team end-
ed an up and down season with
consecutive defeats at David-
son and Catawba. The scores
from both meets were 36-13,
dropping the Generals’ final
duel meet record to 4-8.

As was the case during most
of the season, senior captain
Dave Stoeffel and freshmen
Tim Valliere and Carlton
Peebles turned in strong perfor-
mances. Peebles pinned his
Davidson opponent and had an
impressive 11-3 win at Catawba.
Vailiere and Stoeffel posted 7-0
and 16-5 victories, respectively,
at Davidson. Freshman
Richard Kopelman also came

un with a win. 16-13, at
captain Stoeffel and coach Gary

Franke. Stoeffel reshaped the
team’s defeatist attitude with a
strong speech he gave after the
Generals got off toa 1-4 start. At
the same time, coach Franke,
realizing he was working with
an inexperienced and usually
undermanned team, persistent-
ly made an effort to raise
morale and make everyone
prepared for each meet.

The team already appears to
have a strong nucleus with
which it can make an even bet-
ter improvement next season.

ood mat sense and quickness,
it is possible that '81-'82 will be a
winning season.

In spite of its problems on as
well as off the mat, the
Generals made a slight im-
provement on last season’s 3-8
record. The credit should go to
Catawba. The final week of ac-
tion raised Valliere’s record,
from both duel meets and tour-
naments, to 13-11, the best on

the team. Stoeffel was second at
13-15, followed by Peebles at
9-13.

11 Lax Players
To Miss Game

by Rick Swagler

As a result of curfew viola-
tions which occured during the
lacrosse team’s week of train-
ing in Florida, eleven players,
many of whom are starters, will
probably not participate in
Saturday's scrimmage game
against the Virginia Beach
Lacrosse Club.

In an effort to ensure devotion
to the week of practice, Coach
Jack Emmer imposed a 12:00
curfew. However, eleven
players violated curfew on one
night, according to reliable

sources. Most of those in viola-
tion were starters, and two
were All-Americans.

a very different story. When
asked if he had any
problems with curfew viola-

desire for dedication from his
team necesitated his adoption
of a ‘‘get-tough’’ policy regar-
ding the curfew.

The loss of the eleven will no

result of the proposed one-game

| Teams Enjoy
Florida Trips

by Rick Swagler

During the Washington Holi-
day, both the baseball and
lacrosse teams went to Florida
as part of their training for the
spring sports season. Although
Coaches Jack Emmer and
Craig Jones said that Florida
boasted of good weather and
superior field conditions, they
cited somewhat different objec-
tives for the trips.

Jones remarked that, ‘‘The
guys had been pent-up in the
gym, and we just wanted to
chew some tobacco and get in
the mood for baseball.’’ Jones
said a prime reason for the trip
was to evaluate his team in ‘‘an
outdoor situation.’’ Sophomore
outfielder Jody Harris stated,
“In Florida, we had the oppor-
tunity to play some excellent
ballclubs.’’ The three teams the
Generals faced, Rollins College
(whom W&L opposed three
times), Florida Central Univer-
sity, and Florida Institute of
Technology, are all nationally
ranked in Division II.

According to Harris, the
team’s strength lies in the solid
core of veterans who anchor
this relatively young team (half
of the players are rookies), but
admits that the primary
weakness lies in the pitching
staff. ‘At this point, we have a
definite weakness in the pit-
ching department,’’ states Har-

 
 
  
  

 

2.00 Cover

SDI WIT ar WWI Da,

 

ris. “With Rich Hachenburg
and Marty Thomas the only
veteran moundsmen, our inex-
perience is certainly a factor at
this point.”’

Coach Jones was so en-
thusiastic about shortstop Chris
Cavalline’s hitting that he was
switched from leadoff in the
batting order to fourth, a slot
normally reserved for a team’s
power hitter, and said, “If he
keeps hitting the ball, he'll stay
there."’ Jones also coted noted
that freshman Dave War-
renfeltz was impressive at third
base and relief pitcher. The
freshman’s performance at the
‘*Hot Corner,’ has been profi-
cient enough to force the
removal of incumbent third
sacker Jeff Haggerty to first
base, at least for the time being.

Although a curfew did exist, it
was not strictly enforced.

Lacrosse coach Jack Emmer
said that his team improved its
offensive and defensive
systems while in Florida. Em-
mer noted that he would have
liked to spend another week in
Florida. Despite the obvious
benefits of weather and field
conditions, Emmer wanted to
bring his charges to Florida so
that they could focus all their
attention on preparing for the
season, slated to start on March
7.

UC Discusses Chance Of

Intellectual Convocation

by John Wells

Washington & Lee's Universi-
ty Council yesterday passed a
motion to appoint a committee
to investigate the possibility of
a quadrennial student-run
‘intellectual convocation”
similar to the mock convention.

The motion followed a discus-
sion on a proposal by faculty
members William L. Sessions
and Thomas A. Williams, who
head a subcommittee on liberal
education. In an outline of the
proposal, Williams suggested a
combined — student-faculty-ad
ministration effort to create a
symposium dealing with ‘any
number of academic
disciplines’ in a time frame
and structure similar to that of
the mock convention.

Williams said the convocation
would feature opposing planks
on a topic of local or national
importance, with appropriate
guest speakers to be invited.
The symposium would produce
a white paper on the subject.
Williams mentioned world
hunger and the energy shortage
as two possible topics.

Sessions drew parallels be-
tween the proposal and the
mock convention and similar
events conducted annually at
the nation’s’ military
academies.

The proposal’s intent was met
with generally favorable re-
action by the council, although

there are some members who
doubted the sucess of such an

OTe ealty member Milton Col-
vin said that student participa-
tion in the convocation would be
critical to its success. Colvin
then said he seriously questions
the amount of student interest
in such a project during the
spring term.

 

“If there’s a grain party at
Zollman’s Pavilion the same
day, you might carry it off,”
Colvin said. ** But I'll bet the
ranch in Texas you won't.”

Albert C. Gordon, another
faculty member, pointed out
that the mock convention runs
concurrent with the US.
presidential election, a matter
of national attention. Inter-
fraternity Council President
Monte Briscoe said that the con-
vention was also unique in its
blend of social and political
motivation.

Discussion leaned in favor of
a meticulously planned con-
vocation to be held early in the
spring term to insure female
participation from the local
woman's colleges. It was
agreed that such an _ event
should be held every four years
to alternate with the mock con-
vention.

Faculty member Louis
Hodges said that while he
agreed with some of the ex-
pressed reservations, he was in
favor of looking into the matter.
Hodges moved to appoint an ex-
ploratory committee, and the
motion was passed unanimous-
ly.

The committee will be
selected by council co-chairmen
Lewis G. John and Joe Robles.
It will look into the feasibility
and desirability of holding a
convocation and report back to
the council at its April 29
meeting.

At the suggestion of Ex-
ecutive Committee President
Bob Willis, the next meeting .of
the council will deal with what
Willis described as ‘‘the con-
tinuing seperation of the law
and undergraduate campuses
at all levels of the university.”’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

While At The Ball

Once again the highlight of the W&L social season
is upon us. Across the campus rooms are cleaned, hot
tubs are hooked up, and final arrangements are made
for the university’s biggest blast. By now most of us
have purchased tickets for the Fancy Dress Ball and
had an opportunity to purchase souvenirs galore —
and these are the only souvenirs you should end up
with at the weekend’s finale.

We think that the decorations in the student center
should still be there after the night is over. Anyone
who has been around the student center this week has
seen the Student Activities Board work tediously set-
ting up for the event. These guys have really put out
the maximum effort to show the university a good or
amazing time. The budget is running a bit high this
year and it will help the board if we all purchase our
souvenirs, instead of stealing them. It would be
dishonest and highly inconsiderate to do so.

The Big 3

In a few weeks we will all have an opportunity to
vote for the ‘“‘big three’’ on our student body. The
president, vice president and secretary are important
posts in matters of administration and honor. It is im-
portant that qualified people hold these posts. We
urge anyone interested to go for the job and let your
credentials be known.

Congratulations, Mr. Johnson

Dear Editor:

Congratulations on_ the
wonderful honor recently be-
stowed upon you, Mr. Johnson,
by the Rhodes Committee. |
read it all in the Ring-tum Phi.

After reading the article, I
felt compelled to write. Overall,
Mr. Johnson, I must tell you
that when you _ leave
Washington & Lee to travel

across the ‘‘great water’ to Ox-
ford, you will not be leaving
your troubles behind you. No,
Mr. Johnson. They will go with
you because your troubles, in
good measure, are within you.

How did I come to that conclu-
sion? Let us analyze what you
stated in the Ring-tum Phi.

Early in the article we learn
that you will earn two degrees,
one in physics, one in
mathematics. Yet you state
that you chose W&L seeking a
liberal arts education but doubt
you received that. I doubt it,
too. Methinks that you did not
apply yourself in English,
Biology or Psychology, etc.

‘Your preoccupation with
‘research and_ research
facilities’’ probably
kept you from it. ‘Violently op-
posed to research?” Do you
really meah that, Mr. Johnson?
I give you an F in English Com-

position. By the way, while we
are on the subject of research,
just what percentage of the
population of any liberal arts in-
stitution is interested in doing

research as you are? Have you
taken an official query of your
fellow students to discover how
they feel? How can you feel that
it would be ‘‘money well spent”’

to put in the type of research
facilities you want when few
students desire to use them! F
in Economics.

I’m so glad you went through
rush open-minded. For that
statement you receive an F in
English Grammar. It should be
open-mindedly. By the way, did
any of the fraternities ask you
to pledge? And your statement

“only friends you make in
fraternities are social ones’’
leads me to believe you know
little about human nature. Your
unofficial grade in Psychology,
therefore is an F. (Did you
bother to take any Psychology,

Mr. Johnson?) Point of fact: all
friendships are ‘‘social ones’’ at
first. They must have time to
develop into more.

Now to the juicy stuff. Your

statement “W&L is’ the best
school I know of to get laid.”

How is that possible at an all
male institution? Did I

misunderstand your meaning,
Mr. Johnson? F in English
Sematics.

So you find it difficult to talk
to a woman professionally
without dancing with her first.
That is definitely your problem,

Mr. Johnson. One which I feel
you may be able to overcome as
you work on it. Give ita try.

And lastly, Mr. Johnson,
please tell me why you stayed
on at W&L for four long years?
How long did it take a bright

young fellow like yourself to
discover that W&L was all
wrong and you were all right?

I find you self-centered and a
bore, and I only read about you
yesterday. If you thought you
could “‘find few people at W&L
to talk to,” think how your dates
- the past four years must have
elt.

Nevertheless, I wish you luck
and good fortune. I hope you
find what you are looking for.
You will have to do some

Serious growing up first; and as
you are now in your twenty-
second year, it’s about time.

U.Va. Psychologist Claims Preppies
Subject To Anxiety, Depression

At a time when ‘“‘the prep
look”’ is advertised widely on
television and the sale of pink
and green is doing better than
ever, a psychologist at the
University of Virginia has
theorized that the current dress
fad may result in anxiety,
stereotyped roles and even
mental depression.

Dr. Thomas Gates, director of
UVa.’s University Counseling
Service, claims that being a
‘‘preppie”’ places an unnatural
strain on the roles of men and
women and is unfair to certain
socio-economic groups. Gates
also believes that the new wave
of prep fashions on college
fashions serves as a replace-
ment to the Army jackets and
long hair of the late 1960’s and
early 1970's.

“To be a really good preppie
forces stereotype roles for men
and women, which is something
society has been trying to
diminish,” said Gates. Gates
also claims that being a prep
is more exclusionary than inclu-
sionary, meaning it is more of
an elitist’s undertaking.

According to Gates, people
who wear clothes splashed with
generous amounts of stripes,
checks or flourescent colors are
“seeking a sense of who they
are through external factors,
which is about the most anti-
mental thing you can do.”

Gates said that his service

has experienced a number of
women who spend as much as
two hours getting ‘prepped
up,” only to wind up wearing
matching clothes.

Gates believes that the cur-
rent preppy fad is more difficult
for a psychologist to handle
than marijuana users of the
1960’s. ‘“‘The kids at that time
would confront you openly,”’
said Gates, ‘‘whereas these kids
will snub you quietly and polite-
ly.”

But preppies are now getting
into drugs, believes Gates.
While alcohol was once the only
drug used among the khaki
corps, Gates believes that co-
caine has now become the new
status symbol.

Gates said that among prep-
pies, a golden cocaine straw is a
sign of prestige.

Cocaine is a hit among prep-
pies, Gates believes, because of
its high cost and the resulting
high. Gates said that among
drug-using preppies, the ‘‘in’”’
thing to do is to snort some coke
and then go out for a spin in
their BMW. Gates said he has
seen this occur especially with
preps in their 30’s.

Gates believes that the
University of Virginia allows a
psychologist the opportunity to
see preps and non-preps of all
ages. With an enrollment of
over 16,000, UVa. offers a wide
assortment of graduates and

  

on:

undergraduates from both af-
fluent and non-affluent classes.

Where being prep once was
limited to a small minority of
the school, Gates said the fad
has spread through the campus.
Gates claims he has _ seen
loafers, button-down shirts and
Khaki-pants being worn more
this year than ever before.

Gates also believes that there
is a price to be paid for joining a
fad. “If they think getting
dressed that way is all of a sud-

den going to make them more

popular, they’re crazy,”’ said
the psychologist. ‘‘For the kid
who already feels bad about
himself if this doesn’t work for
him, it might be a confirma-
tion that he isn’t worth
anything.”’

Therefore, Gates is simply
warning all would-be preppies
that being accepted into this fad
may be an invitation toa unique
form of depression — a depres-
sion that is the result of being a
conformist rather than an in-
dividualist, according to Gates.

To avoid falling into the prep
syndrome, Gates says that the
individual should avoid being
taken in by handbooks and
other articles which glamorize
or romanticize the life of prep-
pies — a name derived from the
desire to imitate the products of
those exclusive preparatory
schools.
