Washington and Lee students
who live in Baker Dormitory
this year will likely be paying
substantially more next year
for University Housing.

Because Baker Dormitory
will be occupied by freshmen
next year, law students who live
there now year will have to
choose between living in Woods
Creek apartments, The College
Inn or Davidson Park if they

 

According to E. Stewart
Epley, Treasurer for the
University, Woods Creek apart-
ments will cost $920 on the
average. This is substantially
more than the $640-$700 that the
Baker rooms go for.

Single rooms in the College
Inn will cost $1000, while double
rooms will cost $600 a person.
There will be 10 single rooms
and 10 double rooms available
for the law students next year.

Each of the eleven rooms for
rent in Davidson Park will cost
$800. However, says Epley, two
people can share these rooms at
$400 each. 10 of the rooms are
two bedroom occupancies and
one is a three bedroom dwell-
ing.

Law students who planned to
live in Baker next year are a lit-
tle upset with the University.
Bill Lanning, a freshman law
student, claims ‘the use of

Baker for
undergraduate students is a bad
idea. Financially, Baker cannot
be beat.’’ Another law student,

financially motivated to stay in

at an inconvenient distance
from the law school, the rent is
cheap.”

Frank Parsons, Assistant to
the President of the University,
suggests that discontented law

students see either Dean Schildt
and Professor at W&L law
school or Mr. Mohler about
their housing options. Says Par-
sons, “The University will help
in any way we can. I sym-
pathize with the students but we
are being helpful.”

According to Parsons, Dean
Schildt is supposed to keep the
law students aware of the alter-
native housing choices.

Senators Defend Party Platforms

by Tony Walker

Sen. Richard S. Schweiker
(R. Penn.) spoke last night
about the Republican economic
policies for the ’80’s.
Schweiker began his address in
the same way that
Republican _ presidential
nominee Ronald Reagan has
begun several of his campaign
commercials, with an attack on
the Democratic record of the
past four years.

“Inflation has increased from
4.8 percent in 1976 to 13 percent,
eight million Americans are
unemployed now, seven million
were unemployed in 1976,” said
the Senator. President Carter’s
own indicator of the economic
situation, the “‘misery index’”’
has increased from 12.5 percent
in 1976 to 20.23 percent now. The
misery index is obtained by ad-
ding the inflation rate to the
percentage of unemployed
Americans.

Schweiker seemed confident
that the Republican party plat-

form will provide solutions to

the economic problems faced in

the United States today.

He quoted the Republican
platform to make his point that
the ultimate goal of his party is
a renewal of economic growth,
Schweiker stressed that the
private sector provides a large

majority of jobs in this coun-
try and that all efforts at
stimulating the economy should
be aimed at the private sector.
Schweiker said that the
federal government has grown
“as a middle-man between
employers and employees.”
“The government taxes the
worker’s income and forces him
to pay dearly for Social Security
benefits.” At the same time,
said Schweiker, the employer is
taxed and forced to pay similar-
ly for his employees’ Social
Security benefits. The federal

government lessens the ability
of both persons to make money.
Schweiker described this dou-
ble taxation system as_ the
“federal tax wedge’ and said
that it has grown too large. He
said that a change in direction
is necessary. He claims the
Republican proposals will work
to lessen that tax wedge at the
same time they will decrease
inflation and unemployment.
Schweiker and the Republicans
believe that by cutting taxes
and accelerating equipment

Security

by W. Cope Moyers

The Executive Committee
agreed Monday night to contact
several public officials in Lex-
ington as well as President
Huntley and express its concern
about security for the universi-
ty community.

Several members of the com-
mittee, including president Bob
Willis, will meet with Lexington
Chief of Police J.A. Kirby in the
coming week to discuss ade-
quate security for members of
the university.

“We owe it to the student
body to address this question,”
EC member Marshall Clark

said.
A letter will also be sent to
Kirby, Lexington Mayor

Charles F. Phillips, Jr. and city
council member Tom Imeson
requesting their help in stopp-
ing the recent increase in
crimes against W&L students.
Clark also said that he feels
the university has not address-
ed the security question ade-
quately and can do more to pro-
tect students and their proper-
ty.

Fancy Dress Ticket Price Raised

by Frank Billingsley

The price of Fancy Dress
tickets was raised from $15 to
$20 after a brief debate at the
Student Activities Board
meeting last Sunday night.

The board has recently been
embroiled in controversy over
whether to increase ticket costs
to $20 or $25, if at all and, with
no student attendance at what
was to be a public hearing, the
SAB members debated the
issue among themselves.

Law school student Susan
May said, ‘‘I wouldn’t pay $25 to
come to Fancy Dress!” She

noted that a ten dollar price in-
crease may drive people away
from Fancy Dress.

Senior Ed Kramer countered,
“I’m sympathetic to the view
that $25 may drive people away,
but three days of entertainment
for $25 is not that bad.’’ He add-
ed that $25 per couple could
make Fancy Dress ‘‘really
special,’”’ while $20 would make
it “pretty good.”

Co-chairman Jamie Small,
advocating the ten dollar in-
crease to help pay for a major
concert on the Thursday before
FD, said; ‘‘We should have in-

creased it (the cost) last year
by $5. All a $5 increase would do
is make up for the money lost
last year.”’

Co-chairman Pryse Elam,
compromising the situation,
suggested that $20 tickets would
cover the extra costs this year
and that concert tickets could
possibly be sold separately if
the money was needed. With
this suggestion, Elam made a
motion to raise ticket costs to
$20. The motion carried
unanimously.

The ticket price increase will

campus good security before it
builds another building,” said
Clark. :

Willis said he has been in con-
tact with Chief Kirby this year
and that Kirby told him the
police often catch those involv-
ed but then students fail to press
charges. Unless the victim
agrees to press charges in
court, the accused person must
be released.

Willis told the committee that
it needed to focus on specific in-
stances of crimes against stu-
dents and what might be done to
control the problem. He also
urged students who have been
victims of crime in Lexington to
talk with members of the EC
and the police.

“We need facts and goals if
we hope to resolve this situa-
tion,’’ said Willis.

Clark pointed to the latest in-
cidents of theft which occurred
last weekend at the Robert E.
Lee Hotel. Three Hollins Col-
lege students each reported
thefts from their hotel rooms
and a Sweet Briar College stu-
dent reported the theft of a CB
radio from her car. The EC also
mentioned that police arrested
a W&L employee and charged
him with six counts of breaking
and entering and one count of
grand larceny.

Law representatives Michael
Nogay and Jeff Edwards ex-
pressed concern about ade-
quate security for law students,
especially women walking be-
tween Baker Dormitory and
Lewis Hall.

Nogay said he was especially
troubled about the lack of suffi-
cient lighting across the bridge
leading from Wilson Field to the
gymnasium and said several
women had told him it was ex-
tremely difficult to see other
people on the bridge.

In other business, the com-
mittee approved a motion to

Elam explained the need for
the extra money by noting cost
increases in several areas.
Entertainment for Fancy Dress
is the major reason for the in-

main band will cost $7,000 and
two other bands cost in the
$2,000 range. Building and

Elam went on to say that the

the SAB voted not to allow

Rhythm Band

by Robin Meredith

Just between myself and those of you who read
this column, I think it’s about time for a confession
on my part; musically, I am something of a reac-
tionary (or “hopelessly unreconstructed’’ or
“downright backwards’’, depending on who you
ask). Nowhere is this more obvious than in my
taste in dance music. The extent to which I prefer
Otis Redding, Sam & Dave, or even Southside
Johnny over the Specials, Devo, or the B-52’s is
equivalent to W&L’s preference for Ronald
Reagan over Barry Commoner. What this all ad-
duto: up to is that, admitting a certain bias, in my
opinion Billy Price & the Keystone Rhythem Band
(Cockpit: 11 20) is the finest band you will ever see
in Lexington; if you attend one show this entire
year, make sure this is it.

I was fortunate enough to see Billy Price
headline a wonderful show with the Bill Blue Band
at George Mason University last weekend, and he
simply blew me away (for the third time, I might
add). To give you a little background, although the
Keystone Rhythm Band has only been around
since 1978, Price himself has been on the scene
since the late ‘60’s, when he formed a Pittsburgh-
based band called the Rhythm Kings. From there
he moved on to do a sting as Roy Buchanan’s lead
vocalist from 1973-76. He then abandoned music
and went back to school for a few years, and it was
while he was in school that the nucleus of the
Keystone Rhythm Band was formed.

Price and the KRB play a steamy, funky brand
of R&B, with an occasional Elmore James-style
blues thrown in for good measure. The KRB (two
horns, keyboards, guitar, bass, and drums) is as
solid a back-up unit as you could hope for; the ar-
rangements are tight and well-executed, and tbeir
solos stylish without being overly flashy. They
provide the perfect backdrop for Billy Price, who
is without a doubt the finest R&B singer I have
ever seen or heard. There’s not really much else to
say; the guy can belt, he can preach, he can rap,
he’s a consummate showman, even a great
dancer! ! If it sounds like I think he could move

mountains, well, that’s probably not too far from
the truth, either.

You can hear Billy Price & the Keystone
Rhythm Band for yourself on their debut album, Is
It Over, on Green Dolphin Records, which could be
a bit hard to find in Lexington, but which will no
doubt be on sale in the Cockpit on the night of the
show. Despite the fact that it was recorded without
too large of a budget in a small studio outside Pitt-
sburgh, the record does a fine job of com-
municating the band’s appeal onto vinyl, especial-
ly on Slip Away, which features a capsule version
of one of Billy’s gloriously soulful raps.

When you get down to it, this is probably
the perfect band for Washington & Lee, the long
sought-after compromise that will go down just as
well with the Spinners fans as the Nighthawks
fans. Thanks to the SAB for getting them ‘down
here, and once again, whatever.you do, keep
November 20 open for Billy Price and the
Keystone Rhythm Band in the Cockpit.

More local news — I finally caught up with the
Bill Blue Band at GMU, and I wish I had more
space because they damn near held their own with
Billy Price — they have a unique formula; a little
Seger, a little Nighthawks, a heavy, brassy sound
with lots of guitar — not to be missed — speaking
of the Nighthawks, they are about to begin work on
a new album, which is very tentatively set for
release next April — they are also repressing their
first album, Rock’n’Roll, originally released on
the now-defunct Alladin label, which according to
Mark Wenner is their best-ever studio effort...the
Allstars are about to split up, with Dick Green and
Lucille Schoettle each reportedly planning to get a
new band together...finally, on November 18 you
have a rare chance to see Muddy Waters in a set-
ting as intimate as our own Cockpit, the Mineshaft
in Charlottesville — advance tickets are on sale
right now, and bluesmen of Muddy’s stature don’t
often play the small clubs around here, so you
might want to move fast.

Film Society Continues Series

Friday through Sunday November 7-9, at 7 and 9 pm in duPont

by Carren Kaston

On Friday, November 7 and
Saturday, November 8, the
Washington & Lee Film Society
will present its second movie of
the 1980-81 season, Yannick
Bellon’s Rape of Love (France,
1979). The screenings will take
place in classroom “A” of
Lewis Hall, free of charge.

Rape of Love is a fictional ac-
count of a young woman who is
brutally and graphically raped
by four young men who seem
genuinely puzzled to discover
that she didn’t want it and
didn’t like it. The move con-
cerns the effects of the rape on
her relationship with her
mother, her friends, and, in par-
ticular, her boyfriend, whom
she is about to marry. Most of
all, it concerns her own
response — sexual, emotional,
and, ultimately, legal — to this
supreme invasion of self.

The rape scene at the beginn-
ing of the movie presents as a

graphic reality a sexual fantasy
which is common to both men
and women. Notwithstanding
thé critical controversy sur-
rounding the scene, it remains
essential to the movie’s impact
and significance. It shows that
whatever the fantasy may be,
the reality of rape is not sexy.
The scene is also important for
dramatizing attitudes on the
part of the rapists which, the
rest of the movie reveals, subtly
pervade and characterize our
society at large.

In fact, the ending is the only
place in which is sensitively im-
passioned film does not live up
to its possibilities.

Most of the movie is concern-
ed with showing how different
the world looks to the nurse
after she has been raped. In the
quietest way, the camera
becomes a kind of second eye.
We see a scene first as it would
look to a normal viewer and
then, suddenly, as it is narrow-

ed by the consciousness and
memory of the woman. In one
powerful scene, she stands
before a mirror trying on an
evening gown her mother has
made for her, and in that mirror
she sees the beautiful woman
her mother has raised her to be,
and is then repelled by the
recognition of her own
womanliness.

Perhaps, indeed, the greatest
loss the nurse suffers is this
blighting of her world, this
“rape” of her sense of love and
trust. ‘“Rape”’ literally means
theft.

The Film Society has schedul-
ed its next three moves. They
are Francois Truffaut’s Love on
the Run (France, 1978), set for
December 5 and 6; Rainer
Werner Fassbinder’s The Mar-
riage of Maria Braun
(Germany, 1978), set for
January 16 and 17; and Eric
Rohmer’s Claire’s Knee
(France, 1970).

AuditoriuM. Admission is $1.

Rape of Love (1979) A recent French film directed by Yannick
Bellon, a complete discussion of which appears in the Entertain-
ment section. Presented by the Film Society, Friday and Saturday
November 7 and 8 at 8 pm in Classroom ‘‘A” of the law school. Ad-
mission is free.

Roma, Citta Aperta (Opan City) (1945) Neorealism by Roberto
Rossellini, using real settings and real people to depict real Nazi
oppression, Italian style. Ingrid Bergman junkies may be in-
terested to know that this picture initially attracted the married
film queen to Italian director Rossellini which resulted in an inter-
national scandal in 1949. Presented by the Journalism Department,
Tuesday November 11 at 7 and 9 pm in Reid 203. Admission is free.

fell just short and lost a crucial
21-20 decision to Bridgewater
College at Bridgewater.

‘“‘We can’t expect to play only
one quarter of football and win
a game,”’ said head coach Gary
Fallon. ‘I was proud of the
team in the fourth quarter, but
the only way to win is to get it
into our heads early to play four
quarters of football.”’

The loss dropped W&L’s
record to 5-3 overall and 2-2 in
the ODAC. Bridgewater im-
proved its record to 4-2 overall
and 3-1 in the ODAC.

Two crucial factors con-
tributed to the loss. In the first
quarter W&L’s offense ran
against a stiff wind, which shut
down the Generals’ passing at-
tack. In addition, W&L averag-
ed only 19 yards per punt, giv-
ing Bridgewater excellent field
position all afternoon.

Commented Fallon: ‘‘We
thought-that if we could just run
the ball against the wind, then
we could open up our offense

with the wind. But even with the |

wind we couldn’t get on track.
We weren’t getting into’ our
blocks or executing our plays
effectively.’’

Sophomore tailback Ken
Robinson put W&L on the board
early in the fourth quarter with
a one-yard touchdown. Five
minutes later, junior quarter-
back Rich Hachenburg moved
his team to the Bridgewater
three-yard line. From there,
senior slotback Chris Leiser
drove in for the touchdown to
make the score 21-14.

For the second week in a row
both Leiser and Hachenburg
were the Generals’ offenive
stars. On 27 carries Leiser pick-
ed up 122 of W&L’s total 188
yards rushing. Hachenburg
completed 15 of 27 passes for 139
yards.

‘“‘Hachenburg has been very
consistent for us,’’ stated
Fallon. ‘‘He has improved his
ball-handling abilities and gives
our offense the added advan-
tage of a mobile QB. Leiser con-
tinues to do a great job for us
and has filled in well for
Cavalline (sophomore
tailback), who is still not at full
Strength.”

With under a minute left in

the game, Hachenburg
maneuvered his team to the
Bridgewater 29-yard line.
Hachenburg then found junior
tight-end Mike Fogarty in the
end zone for a touchdown with
only 27 seconds left.
.° On the afternoon, Fogarty
caught five passes for 62 yards
and scored his second touch-
down in as many games.

Rather than go for an extra
point and the tie, the Generals
tried for two points. Hachen-
burg flipped a short pass to
Leiser at the goal line, but a
Bridgewater defensive back
was right on top of the play,
shoving Leiser back and stopp-
ing W&L just inches short of a
come-from-behind victory.

Next week the Generals take
on Maryville College at
Maryville. Fallon described the
Scots as ‘‘a very explosive foot-
ball team, a team against which
we are going to have to score a
lot of points just to keep up with
them.’’

Booters Shut Out, 1-0

by Mark Schramm

“On another day, this game
would have been ours,’’ said
veteran goalie Kevin Carney,
‘but not today.”’ The Generals
had just dropped a 1-0 decision
to Lynchburg, and the loss end-
ed their hopes of receiving an
NCAA playoff bid.

Earlier in the week, W&L
kept their playoff hopes alive by
defeating a tough Virginia
Wesleyan team 1-0, on Winger
Tom Elder’s unassisted goal.

Bolstered by the return of
Midfielder-Captain Bryan
Williams from a leg injury, the
Generals refused to back down
from the aggressive Marlins.

opportunities, including a
brilliant corner kick by Winger
Brad Poorman that was re-
jected at the last second.

Later, Bryan Williams _ in-
tercepted a ball at midfield and
looped a pass to Craig Burns.
The speedy forward beat his
defender and unleased a shot
from the 20-yard mark that the
diving goaltender pulled out of
the far corner. :

 

Mark Turner and Ben Muskin move in to assist Sullivan.

 

At the 8:11 mark Tom Elder
scored his second goal of the
season. A Marlin defender at-
tempted to clear the ball
downfield, but Elder _in-
tercepted at the 30-yard line.

“T really wasn’t sure where
the net was,”’ said the tall, lean
sophomore, ‘I gave it a good
kick and all of a sudden it was in
the back of the net.”’

The goal was an important
one for Elder. ‘It’s been a
frustrating season for me per-
sonally; I haven’t been taking
enough shots, and I’ve only
scored two goals.’”’ However,
Elder’s aggressive tackling and
sharp passing has been a fine
complement to his high-scoring

front line teammates Brad
Poorman and Roland Simon.

The action continued into the
second half, with both teams
getting excellent scoring
chances. Roland Simon had two
one-on-one shots thwarted, and
a Tom Elder blast was slightly
wide.

The Generals’ defense gained
another shutout, with Goalie
Kirk Mancer making several

key saves down the stretch to
preserve the victory. Defender
Steve Smith earned yet another
Player of the Game award for
his brilliant efforts.

The season climaxed Satur-
day as the Generals faced Lyn-
chburg in a match that would
determine whether they would
get an NCAA bid. Lynchburg
entered the match undefeated
and unscored upon in con-
ference contests; in fact, they
have not lost an ODAC match
since the inception of the con-
ference five years ago.

Both teams were fired up, and
there was virtual non-stop ac-
tion throughout the match.
Brad Poorman got a pair of ear-
ly shots, and the Generals’
defense cleared the zone well.

“The fan support was a
definite factor,’’ said Coach
Rolf Piranian, ‘‘The crowd real-
ly kept us in the game.”’

Early in the second half, Lyn-
chburg pressured the W&L net,
and eventually scored. A Lyn-
chburg forward got behind the
defense and his shot just eluded
the outstretched arms of Kirk
Mancer. The play appeared to
be offsides, but the goal was
allowed to stand. !

‘We came right back,
though,”’ Piranian said. “I’m
really proud of our guys. We put
some hellacious pressure on
them; they knew they’d played
a game.”

In the past, previous Generals
clubs have choked in the same
situation, losing by scores of 3-0,
3-1, and 5-0, but this time there
were no tightened collars. “‘It
was the toughest match we’ve
had all year,’’ said a Lynchburg
midfielder, ‘‘Those guys never
quit.”’

Despite the loss, Piranian
seemed pleased. ‘‘This year we
learned how to win. We've got
most of our players coming
back next year and I think we
have a realistic chance of get-
ting a bid then.”

"Anytime you lose three
seniors and a player like
Stewart Jackson, it’s always a
rebuilding year; but this team
is every bit as capable as last
year’s.”

These were the words of ten-
nis coach Gary Franke in
assessing the 1980-81 General
tennis squad, which faces a big
challenge as it attempts to
maintain W&L’s tradition of
success.

The Generals carry two im-
pressive laurels into this
season. First, they have
dominated the ODAC since its
inception in 1977, winning all
four team championships and
30 of 36 individual titles. In addi-
tion, the netmen have finished
in the top five for the past four
years in the Division III NCAA
Championships.

The ‘80-81 Generals, perhaps
lacking some of the depth of
previous teams, certainly have
no lack of talent. Continuing in

the tradition of W&L greats Ben
Johns and Stewart Jackson is
Pete Lovell, NCAA AIll-
American in both singles and
doubles.

Since transferring to W&L
last fall, Lovell has proved to be
one of the most consistent
players on the squad. He im-
mediately moved into the
number two spot last season,
finishing with an 11-14 record.
Coach Franke was highly prais-
ing of Lovell’s play this fall.
‘“‘We now believe that he is one
of the best NCAA Division III
players.”

Playing behind Lovell will be
senior Co-captain and _ three
year letterman Doug Gaker.
Gaker had an inconsistent fall,
making the transition from
flight four to two this year.
However, Coach Franke points
to Gaker’s enthusiasm, which
should “‘help lead him and the
team to another fine NCAA
finish.” In the past three
seasons, Gaker has turned in a

Water Polo Takes Three

by Dave Johnson

The W&L water polo team
finished second in the Virginia
State Championships held here
last weekend. The University of
Richmond, a team that the
Generals defeated the previous
week, was the tournament
champion.

The Generals accumulated
three wins and two losses in the
tourney, with a 12-3 win over
V.M.I., and 9-5 and 12-4 vic-
tories over James Madison
University. Both of W&L’s
losses occurred at the hands of
Richmond by scores of 5-2 and
7-4. The weekend action brings

Tournament high scorers for
the Generals were Mike Bernot

each scored six goals. ‘“‘Shark’’
Smith’s shooting percentage for
the weekend was an impressive
67 percent. Also performing
well for the Generals were Tim
Rock and Rand McClain, who

One of the main weaknesses

W&L coach Page Remillard

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi i

F-D Tickets

In case you missed the Student Activities Board
meeting Sunday night, the annual controversy over
Fancy Dress tickets was seemingly resolved: As
usual, no one showed up from the student body and
the majority decided in favor of raising the ticket
price from $15 to $20. Unlike years past, this year the
SAB is not trying to make a profit from the universi-
ty’s biggest bash. Instead, co-chairmen Jamie Small

€

f

and Pryse Elam are going to put on a fine con-

glomerate of entertainment. Ticket prices have not
been raised since 1974, and the extra $5 per person
will give Small the type of money he needs to get a
good band.

We obviously favor the ticket price increase if it
means good entertainment. But we would like to see
Thursday’s entertainment picked in public meetings,
not closed ones. The SAB has done an outstanding job
thus far, and we think the board can plan some of the
best entertainment any Fancy Dress or this student
body has ever seen. The only way we can see the
entertainment choices is if they are discussed and
debated in public.

Housing

Whether you have noticed it or not, University hous-
ing is going to be pretty scarce next year. And unless
you want to spend your time sleeping in a pup tent on
the back campus, you had best start looking for hous-
ing now. We urge students to go to the university for
help and look for housing — to see what the University
is actually doing to house the student body.

An Apology

About this week’s paper. We are sorry that it is only
eight pages —- but a breakdown in equipment and a
letdown in advertising, have taken their toll. We will
try to Keep it from happening again.

EC Feels
Disappointed

Dear Sirs:

The Executive Committee
feels that last week’s Ring-tum
Phi editorial concerning the
proposed constitutional revi-
sions contained statements that
were both unfounded and irrele-
vant to the issue at hand. Your
question that “If the Executive
Committee cannot interpret a
simple constitution, how can it
conduct an honor hearing?”
contains a serious implication
based on more on a personal,
and misguided, opinion of the
relationship between the two
issues than on an informed and
objective assessment of the
facts.

We recognize that other opi-
nions about the student con-
stitution might very well exist,
but we expect that these will be
voiced reasonably, and in the
interests of the student body.
Further, we wish to express our
disappointment in the state-
ment cited above, as it serves to
circumvent an intelligent and
responsible debate of the issues,
by substituting emotion for
reason.

We welcome the active, if
possibly critical, interest of the
paper in all matters public. We
only want the Ring-tum Phi to
live up to the standards of quali-
ty journalism that we all know

Spectator, be a vegetable

Do you feel like a garbage collector when you
wake up in the morning to your same old face?
Overwhelmed by nausea when you smell your
same old girlfriend? Repulsed when you sift
through professorial trash, stale jokes and insipid
lectures? Disgusted by heathen bores and lying
virgins? Smothered by this hill-sized dump of
monotony?

Take heart, my friends, lovers of the unex-
pected, the exciting, the exhilarating. Washington
and Lee may be boring, but all is not lost to
tedium, to ennui, to dull routines. A new club is
afoot which is devoted to sensual pleasures of the
most extraordinary nature. This is Club Legume
with facilities in New York, Paris, and Lexington.
Membership is exclusive and dues are exorbitant,
but if you qualify, the benefits will be grand.

Wouldn’t you like to be a vegetable? You would
have no worries, no cares; the club attends to your
every need. All you do sit back and enjoy the good
life. Sun lamps provide you with a radiant and ripe
tan. You don’t have to worry about matrimonial
relationships, simply to reproduce. In a word, sen-

sualism is where it’s at. Vegetablish is truly a
natural high.

Club Legume ensures elitism; only the best
vegetables need inquire. No eggplants with horn-
rims have ever nor ever will be admitted. There is
a three year waiting list for those who vegetate as
cucumbers. It seems anyone in Lexington can be a
mere cucumber. Watermelons are decidedly
lower class. Mushroomers, though not of
vegetable class specifically or scientifically, are
certainly there in spirit. Shrooms really know how
to vegetate and are given lifetime membership.
Beans, carrots, celery and other rubbish are
frowned on. If you come as a broccoli, cauliflower,
or artichoke, it may already be too late as Club
Legume doesn’t take drooling vegetables.
Tomatoes require the proper Russian accoutre-
ment; squashes the correct mixer. No greasy
potatoes!

At any rate, if you think you qualify as a real
vegetable, and if you need a break, send your
resume to Spectator, c/o Ring-tum Phi. I’m a pep-
per — he’s a pepper; why dohkt-you be a vegetable,
too? be =~

The Student Activities Board
reported to the committee its
rationale for increasing the
price of Fancy Dress tickets by
$5 or $10.

Co-chairman Pryse Elam
said the increase would meet
the rising costs of entertain-
