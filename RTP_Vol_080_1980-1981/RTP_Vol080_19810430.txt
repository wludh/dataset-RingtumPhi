 

Leonel L. Kahn Jr., associate
professor of drama at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, died Sunday night in a Lex-
ington hospital following a
lengthy illness. He was 46.

A memorial service was held
at 2 p.m. Tuesday in Lee
Chapel. Rabbi Sheldon Ezring
conducted the service, assisted
by Dr. David W. Sprunt.

Kahn is survived by his wife,
Betty Spitzberg Kahn Of Lex-
ington; two sons, Jerome Ed-
ward Kahn of Dallas, Tex. and
David Carl Kahn of Lexington;
a daughter, Alyson Lynne Kahn
of Lexington; and, a brother,
Carl J. Kahn of Lafayette, La.

Kahn was born May 21, 1934,

 

in New Orleans where he also
received both his
undergraduate and graduate
education at Tulane University.
He earned the _ bachelor’s
degree from Tulane in 1957 and
the masters of fine arts degree
in 1959,

He taught for three years at
Delta State University in
Cleveland, Miss., prior to join-
ing Washington and Lee’s facul-
ty in 1965 as instructor in fine
arts and director of the univer-
sity’s Troubadour Theatre.

In his capacity as director of
the theatre, Kahn was chiefly
responsible for building W&L’s
strong theatre arts program.
He directed numerous plays,

 

starting with a 1965 production
of “Waiting for Godot.’’ Kahn
gained the reputation for not on-

ly producing plays of con-
sistently high quality but also
for selecting very significant
plays. Under Kahn’s direction,
for instance, W&L’s University
Theatre presented ‘‘Equus”’ in
1974 before the play had opened
in New York.

Kahn spent the 1970-71
academic year in Spain where
he studied contemporary
Spanish theatre. He also con-
ducted several spring term
study abroad programs in
which students studied theatre

both in London and Florence.

In 1975, Kahn was elected ex-
ecutive vice president of the
board of the American
Academy of Dramatic Arts.

Lee Kahn, Builder Of Theater Program, Dies

‘In the 16 years that Lee was
here, he was instrumental in
producing a strong university
theatre program which tapped
the resources of the entire
university community,” said
William J. Watt, dean of the col-
lege at W&L. ‘“‘The plays that
Lee staged were not only en-
joyable productions but also
served to educate the communi-
ty about the significance of
theatre in its many forms.”

The family has suggested that
instead of flowers, friends
might wish to _ consider
memorial contributions to
either the Lexington Rescue
Squad or Washington and Lee’s
theatre program.

EC Approves Changes
In Law School Elections

by Todd Smith

Amidst the confusion of Mon-
day night’s Executive Committee
consideration of constitutional in-
terpretation, someone called for a
ruling from Robert’s Rules of
Order.

“Iam Robert,” joked President

Bob Willis, “and I make the
rules.”

mented Frank Smith,
sophomore EC representative.

Disorder marked discussions
on motions by Senior Law
Representative Jeff Edwards to
move the election of the first

October to September, despite
the October date specified in the
constitution.

The Washington and Lee
lacrosse team downed the
University of Baltimore 15-7
yesterday at Wilson Field. The
game marked the Generals’
. sixth consecutive win over
Baltimore.
The Generals struck hard and
early, building up a 10-1 lead at
halftime. Baltimore came back

with six goals in the second half,
but it was too little, too late for
the SuperBees.

Standouts for W&L included
Geoff Brent, who scored three
goals; George Santos, Mike
Schuler, and Rob Staugaitis
each netted two.

The victory boosts the
Generals’ record to 5-3.
Baltimore fell to 4-7.

representation. At stake was
the constitutionality of the mo-
tion for September elections,
which was finally passed over
the votes of Willis, Vice Presi-
dent Willie Mackie, Secretary
Bud White and freshman Ben
Hale.

The constitution was written
when the law students and the
undergraduates used the same
calendar. Now, however, the
law school starts in mid-August,
almost a month before
undergraduates.

Edwards voiced “great con-
cern” that should a law student
be charged with an honor viola-
tion, the EC would have only
one law school member (there
is one representative for both
second and third year classes).

“I don’t see just flying in the
face of the constitution like
this,’ commented Mackie.

Retiring professor William
W. Pusey III and EC President,
Bob Willis, were among those
honored at yesterday evening’s
senior banquet, held in Evans
Dining Hall.

Pusey was recipient of two
awards, the first was a new
award honoring outstanding
faeulty members. It was
presented by the EC, and will
become an annual award bear-
ing Pusey’s name. Pusey’s se-
cond award came fron the Ring-
tum Phi, also to recognize his
lforty-two years of outstanding
‘service to the university.

KA Fined, Penalized
By IFC. Judicial Board

The judicial board of the
Interfraternity council met
Tuesday night to settle a
dispute involving members of
the Lambda Chi Alpha and the
Kappa Alpha fraternities.
Throughout the winter term,
members of the two fraternities
have traded bottle throwing in-
cidents and several fights have
erupted.

On return from spring break,
the window breaking and bottle
smashing continued.

Last Wednesday night, the
police were summoned by
Lambda Chi on reports that
several KA’s were breaking
their windows. Preston Moore,
KA president, denied the
charge and stressed the need
for clarification of such allega-
tions.

The police were again sum-
moned by Lambda Chi on Fri-
day night. They reported that
several KA’s had burned that
fraternity’s initials onto the
Lambda Chi front lawn. Subse-
quently, a fight broke out bet-
ween two members of Lambda
Chi and several members of KA
that the police dispersed.

The police were summoned to

Lambda Chi a third time on
Saturday night, after hearing
that a KA had broken several
more of their windows. Preston
Moore stressed that only a few
members of his house were
responsible for these incidents.

Moore went on to say that
those individuals responsible
were reprimanded and fined by
the fraternity. He also offered
to have the damage repaired by
those involved.

After a_ fifteen minute
deliberation, the judicial board
decided to fine KA $150 and
place them on conduct proba-
tion for the remainder of the
term. Conduct probation is the
equivalent of a severe warning.

If the fraternity in question
commits another offense, it will
then be placed on social proba-
tion for the remainder of the
school year. The KA’s were also
told to fix the Lambda Chi’s
front yard and thirteen broken
windows by today.

Although the Lambda Chi’s
were not fined, the fraternity
was warned that any additional
infractions by them would
likewise result in social proba-
tion.

Mellvain Exhibition Tours

Works by Isabel Mcllvain,
sculptor-in-residence at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, are currently included in two
major exhibitions and will
soon be part of a third exhibi-
tion which will travel in Europe.

One of Mcllvain’s recent
sculptures, ‘Standing Female
Figure,” is part of the in-
augural exhibition for the San
Antonio Museum of Art in San
Antonio, Texas.

The exhibition, which opened
March 1, is entitled ‘Real,
Really Real, Super Real: Direc-
tors in Contemporary American
Realism” and includes works
by such artists as Andrew
Wyeth, George Segal and
Richard Estes. The exhibition
will close in San Antonio on
April 26 and then begin a three-
city tour. It will be shown at the
Indianapolis (Ind.) Museum of

Art from May 19 through June
28, at the Tucson (Ariz.)
Museum of Art from July 19
through August 26, and at the
Carnegie Institute Museum of
Art in Pittsburgh from October
24 through January 3, 1982.

Another of Mcllvain’s
sculptures is in a traveling ex-
hibition organized by New
York’s Pratt Institute. Shown at
the Pratt Manhattan Center
Gallery last November, the ex-
hibition, ‘Sculpture in the 70s:
The Figure,’’ will be at Arizona
State University in Tempe,
Ariz., and at Dartmouth College
Museum and Galleries later
this year.

Mclivain, assistant professor
of art at W&L, is also one of four
sculptors whose works are in-
cluded in a book by Frank
Goodyear, curator of the Penn-

WLUR Radiothon

WLUR-FM, the broadcasting
service of Washington and Lee
University, will sponsor a fifty-
hour radiothon starting at 6:00
pm, Friday, May 8, and continu-
ing through to 8:00 pm on Sun-
day the 10th. The marathon,
non-stop broadcast will benefit
the Rockbridge Area Relief
Association (RARA), an af-
filiated agency of the United
Way. RARA provides emergen-

cy loans and _ financial
assistance for Rockbridge
County residents who are

underprivileged or are faced
with sudden, catastrophic ex-
penses, from fires in the home
to the need for a tow-truck.
During the radiothon, the
team of Eric Fife and Steve
Warren will remain on the air
playing selections requested by
‘ donors., The, format will remain

essentially the same as for most
weekends on WLUR: jazz, the
Metropolitain Opera, and Third
Ear. However, requests will be
entertained from callers who
make pledges to RARA, and
prizes will be auctioned off by
Fife, Warren, and such special
guests as other WLUR radio
personalities and officers of the
charity.

In weeks to come, workers for
the station and the United Way
agency will contact local
businesses, citizens, and frater-
nity houses to request pledges
for the marathon broadcast.
Special prizes will be given the
five highest donors; pledges
can be made now through the
station and RARA canvassers,
or during the radiothon itself by
calling the station at 463-9126.

sylvania ‘Academy, and will

also be part of an exhibition to
accompany the book. That ex-
hibition will travel in Europe
later this year.

A member of the Washington
and Lee faculty since 1975,
Mcllvain has had seven one-
woman shows including a 1977
exhibition at Gallery 4 x 10 in
New York. Her figures have
also been shown in many
galleries and museums and are
included in numerous public
and private collections.

Spring
Weekend
Sprung

by M. Shaw Pyle

You may not have known, but
a major part of W&L’s annual
Spring Weekend has already
come and gone. The Thursday
night of Fancy Dress was the
evening of the John Prine
concert, an event the cost of
which was a major factor in the
SAB’s contracting of an $8,000
Fancy Debt. Consequently, this
year’s Spring Weekend will be a
very laid-back affair. Friday
night will see another class
grain party, and Saturday will
be left free except for the
lacrosse game and a party in
the gym parking lot immediate-
ly following, with Southern rock
specialists the Ray Pitman
Band. There will be no SAB
films during Spring Weekend,
but the weekend of the 8th will
be set aside for a Woody Allen
filmfest. For further details of
Spring Weekend ’81, see the

Film Notes

Pirosmani (USSR, 1971) A W&L Film Society presentation, this
Soviet ‘great poetic biography’ is a tribute to the cunning of direc-
tor Georgi Shengelaya. Somehow, from the state-inspired
mediocrity of all post-Eisenstein film, a minor masterpiece. Friday
and Saturday, May 1 and 2, in classroom ‘A’ of Lewis Hall; 8 pm;
free of charge.

The Rules of the Game: (France, 1939) More Renoir. This time, a
film from that dreamy era between Munich and the start of the Se-
cond World War. Distressed by the appeasement in the
bourgeoisie’s mind, Renoir directed his own script of comic class
conflict to point up their failure. He became the most detested man
an France for his pains, and saw this, his last French film, canned
by a government fearful for ‘morale’ (read its own self-respect).
Thursday. Reid 203, free.

Blood Beach: Just when you thought it was safe to go back into
the theatre...here comes another dollop of gore. If you want an ex-
cuse to hold hands with your latest while she screams herself silly,
this one’s for you. Or, if you’re lonely and miss the beach, knock
back a cold six, round up the guys, and head for the movie house;
this is a great film to be snide about with the gang. At the Lyric ’til
tonight.

The Competition: Class struggle and Steinways in Old Moskva,
with heaping spoonfuls of saccharine and tears. The film stars
Richard Dreyfuss and Amy Irving as the starcrossed pianists (both
apparently made of cardboard). Bring Kleenex: the gals will be
sniffling and you'll need something to laugh (or lose lunch) in.
Through Thursday at the State.

The Conflict: Omen III: And you always knew politics was hell.
Eerie music, heavy evil, power politics, and eye of newt are the
main ingredients for the conclusion of the Omen trilogy. Whatever
floats your boat....At the Lyric, beginning Friday.

Hardly Working: hardly works. Jerry Lewis is running a little
low on cash, I guess, so he’s making a profit by making an ass of
himself on screen — again. A tired goulash of gags masquerading
as a film. Ten and under, maybe? Starts Friday at the State.

and in Buena Vista...

Any Which Way You Can: Apparently the title refers to what
Eastwood will do nowadays For A Few Dollars More. A delightful
and intellectually stimulating film about an orangutan who voices
social concern by defecating in police cars. But I guess it sells pop-

corn, At Cinema One.

The Washington and Lee
lacrosse team broke ahead
from seven tied-scores to edge
Washington College 15-14 last
Saturday. The victory raised
the Generals to a 12th-place na-
tional Division I ranking.

The Shoremen scored first,
before the Generals tallied five
straight for their largest lead.
Washington, though, battled for
a 5-5 deadlock, whereupon
seniors Geoff Brent and George
Santos scored to give W&L a 7-5
halftime edge.

The Generals went ahead 8-5
early in the third period, only to
watch the Shoremen knot the
game at 8. Deadlocks occurred
at 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14, with W&L
pulling ahead each time. The
game-winner, an unassisted

score by junior midfielder Bob
Carpenter, came with 4:57 left
_to play.

team’s Player-of-the-Game

The Generals conclude their
home schedule on May 2, when
they take on Roanoke College at
2:00 p.m. The Maroons, who
hold an 8-3 record after a 20-13
loss to North Carolina, are
ranked fourth in this week’s
Division III poll.

week,’’ begins ninth-year head

coach Jack Emmer, referring —

ing against Virginia.

“Roanoke is a competitive
club with a lot of scoring abili-
ty; hence, our contest may have

  

Jack Emmer listened to referee’s explanation.

‘Washington proved itself to
be a fine offensive team,’’ Em-
mer offered. ‘‘Fortunately, we
thought they’d be capable of
such scoring, so we simply tried
our best to stay ehead and not
get behind.”

Senior midfielder John Kemp
and sophomore attackman
Geoff Wood scored three times
each to pace W&L, which gain-
ed its fourth straight win over
Washington College. Brent,

a tendency to develop into a
shooting match. Our series has
been a well-fought one in the
past, and Saturday’s game
should be another emotional
contest.’”’

W&L leads the series with
Roanoke 10-2-0. Last spring in
Salem, the Generals tallied ten
consecutive goals during the se-
cond and third quarters on the
way toa 15-6 victory.

Generals Lose ODAC,

by John Harrison

After reaching a milestone
last week by qualifying for the
0.D.A.C. tournament, the W&L
baseball team will be going
after an even more significant
milestone this Saturday when
the Generals take on_ the
hapless VMI Keydets. Should
the Generals win both games of
the scheduled doubleheader, it
would be the first time since
1948 that a W&L baseball team
has won twelve games; this
year’s team is 10-12. The last
winning team was the 1972
squad, which posted an 11-10
mark.

Since the Keydets are a lowly
1-30, W&L’s chances of finishing
.500 look very good. On the other
hand, if the Generals drop both
games (as they did last year), it
would be a rough conclusion toa
season in which the team had
hopes of finishing with a win-
ning record.

In last Saturday’s semi-final
game with Lynchburg, W&L
played its best game of the
three which have been played
between the two schools this
year. After losing to the Hornets
during the regular season by
scores of 11-2 and 24-4, the
Generals scored four runs in the
top half of the first inning, and
were as Close as 8-6 after 7-1 in-
nings, before they lost 14-7. Lyn-
chburg’s Dave Smith, the
ODAC’s top pitcher with a 7-0
record and 1.48 ERA, threw a
complete game. Offensive stars
for LC were Chip Childress (2
hits, 4 RBI), and Wayne Har-

rison (3-5, 3 RBI). First
baseman Jeff Haggerty drove
in three runs for W&L.

The Generals could find some
consolation in the tournament,

in that Bridgewater could fare
no better against LC in the
championship game. The 12-3
victory allowed the Hornets to
capture their ninth consecutive
20-win season.

The Generals seemed to have
suffered a letdown after the
tournament in its final home
games this past Monday and
Tuesday, against Newport
News Apprentice and
Longwood College. With the
Generals going through the mo-
tions against both teams, who
interestingly enough have iden-
tical 23-12 records, the out-
comes were predictable.

Against Apprentice, W&L
yielded 20 hits, including 5 home

runs and 6 errors en route toa ~
15-8 defeat. The pitching and
defense improved slightly, but
the hitters did not capitalize ina
14-3 loss to Longwood.

The Generals did have
several bright spots during the
two games. Catcher Tripp
Brower drove in 3 runs against
Newport News, and was very
effective at blocking many
potential wild pitches, as he has
been all season. Rightfielder
Jim Daly had four hits in the
two games, and southpaw Mar-
ty Thomas, making his pitching
debut after months of arm trou-
ble, was outstanding on the
mound. He allowed only one run
in six innings of relief.

Golfers Boast Undefeated Record

by Scott Mason

Under the exemplary leader-
ship of Coach Buck Leslie, the
undefeated Washington and Lee
golf team won three times last
week, boosting their record to
10-0. With only two matches re-
maining, the prospect of an
undefeated season is very
realistic.

Last Thursday, the Generals
hosted Radford College in a
match which saw junior Del
Agnew lead the way for the
eventual W&L victory. Agnew
finishe. the day with a total
stroke score of 73, followed by
junior Jim Kaplan and senior
Gerry Barousse, with 75’s.
Junior co-captain Bill Alfano
finished fourth among the
Generals with an 80. The team

won the match with relative
ease, and the final score was
Washington and Lee 303, Rad-
ford 335.

The following day, the
Generals met with equal suc-
cess by downing Hampden-
Sydney and Bluefield Colleges
in a windswept match. This
time, Barousse led W&L golfers
by amassing a score of 75, quite

impressive under such condi-
tions. He was followed by
Agnew, Kaplan, and Alfano,
respectively. The team had lit-
tle difficulty, and came away
with a final score of 397 to
Hampden-Sydney’s 416 and
Bluefield’s 474

The Generals were not yet
finished. Last Monday, the

team travelled to Princeton,
West Virginia and defeated
Bridgewater College and, once
again, Bluefield College.
Freshman Bruce Blythe finish-
ed the day with a_ stroke
average of 75, with teammates
Steve Everett, Gerry Barousse,
and Jim Kaplan all following
close behind. :

On Tuesday, May 5, the golf
team will attempt to achieve
that undefeated season which
they so arduously seek by tak-
ing on Randolph-Macon and
Bridgewater colleges. Both
Leslie and his team are confi-
dent and optimistic, and with
luck, the undefeated season
which just one month ago ap-
peared a mere hope may now
become a reality.

netmen placed third in the Fifth
Annual ODAC Tennis Cham-
pionships, held at W&L April
24-25.

W&L could claim only one in-
dividual champion, while win-
ner Hampden-Sydney had five
individual winners and runner-
up Lynchburg three. W&L’s
senior co-captain, Doug Gaker,
true to his first-place seed at se-
cond singles, cruised through
two opponents on his way to a
6-4, 6-2 victory in the final over
Lynchburg’s Kevin Record.

The Generals had men in the
finals at four different positions
during the tourney, yet only
Gaker could claim his title.

W&L sophomore Steve Denny
made it all the way to the finals
of the third singles before fall-
ing to Blitz James of Hampden-
Sydney, 6-3, 6-4.

In doubles, Gaker teamed
with classmate Pete Lovell for
a second-place finish at first
doubles, falling to Scott Good-
man and Worth Remick of
Hampden-Sydney, 6-2, 6-2.
Likewise, Denny and junior
Wes Yonge succumbed in the

finals of their second doubles
flight to the H-S team of Jim
Cain and Angus McCauley, 7-5,
4-6, 6-4.

‘Three Generals took third
place in their singles brackets;
Lovell at first singles, and
freshmen Scott Berman and
Charles Kalocsay at fifth and
sixth singles, respectively.

Overall, Hampden-Sydney
finished with 62 points, followed
by Lynchburg with 58 and W&L
with 57.

The Generals resumed match
play last Monday with a 9-0 loss
to the Division I University of
Virginia on the opponent’s
home court. Standout perfor-
mances were turned in by Ber-
man, who lost a tough fifth
singles match 2-6, 6-0, 6-3, and
the first doubles team of Gaker
and Lovell, who fell 6-3, 4-6, 7-6
(5-4).

W&L will compete in the W&L
Invitational, to be held May 1-2,
and then take to the road to face
Radford University on May 4.
The Generals close out their
season with a home match
against Virginia Tech, May 8.

Boston Marathon Attracts W&L Runners

by Ralph Frasca

“When I reached the finish
ine, I felt a tremendous ex-
ilaration. I said to myself, ‘It’s
00 bad I’ll have to wait another
65 days to compete again.”
Obviously, Geology professor
‘red Schwab enjoyed his par-
icipation in the Boston
farathon, the annual, 26-mile
oad race. Other members of
1e Washington and Lee com-
iunity who participated in the
‘adition-laden event were
‘nancial Aid Director Mike
artini, and law school students
lave Engel and Dean Greer.
Held April 5, the Boston
[arathon is the only race which
2quires that participants post
qualifying time (dependent
pon one’s age group) in a
revious marathon to qualify
1em for admission into the
eld.

Schwab, age 41, is the veteran
' the foursome, this having
een his fourth Boston
(arathon. Schwab’s time was 2
durs, 57 minutes, and he finish-
1 ‘around 3000th’’ in a field of
yproximately 6800 runners. He
yted, ‘‘with the imposition of
lalifying times, you would
link that there would be fewer
inners. However, that isn’t the
ise. If anything, the field has
creased.’’ Schwab added,

“the qualifying times do ensure
that the runners are of a high
caliber.”

Mike Bartini completed the
road race in 2 hours, 37 minutes,
placing 690th. Like Schwab,
Bartini is no stranger to The
Marathon, having run it in 1979.

“My goal was to run it (the
Marathon) in 2:30 to 2:40,
preferably towards the former.
Although I’m not especially
pleased with my time of 2:37,
I’m satisfied. I did beat my 1979
time by a full 5 minutes,
though.”’

Third-year law student Dave
Engel is a relative newcomer to
distance running.

“T ran a little in high school,
but gave it up entirely in col-
lege,”’ he recalled. ‘‘A friend got
me to take it up again here at
W&L, and I caught ‘Running
Fever.’ ”

Engel, who ran the 26 miles in
3 hours and 5 minutes, stated,
“It was unlike anything I had
ever experienced. The spec-
tators were very supportive.
They were forever offering us
encouragement. A_ runner
couldn’t have asked for a better
crowd.”’

Bartini echoed Engel’s sen-
timents..

“The crowd was full of fun
people. Instead of going to the

 

Professor Schwab training for
marathon.

beach or a ballgame, they came
out to see the Boston
Marathon.”

The undisputed star of the
W&L contingent was Dean
Greer, a second-year law stu-

dent who placed 174th, with a

time of 2:26.

Several criticisms were of-
fered by the W&L runners.

“T felt that there was too
much commercialism surroun-
ding the event,’’ Engel opined.
“There were T-shirt, shoe, and
running magazine exhibitions,
demonstrating the ‘proper
technique,’ and informing
everyone of the only ‘accep-
table’ T-shirt to wear.”’

Schwab added, “The mile
markers were not very visible.
Since most runners pace
themselves according to the
distance they have remaining,
the markers should have been
easily noticeable.

‘‘However,” he said, ‘“‘the
most important change needed
is that female competitors
should be made torun topless.’’

A virtually unavoidable pro-
blem at all races is the
prescence of ‘‘unofficial’’ run-
ners, people who did not qualify
to run, but nonetheless want the
thrill of competing in the na-
tion’s most prestigious
marathon. Thus, they jump out
of the crowd and join the pack.

“There were some oddball
unofficials,’”’ Schwab related.
“One guy ran the whole race in
a Superman outfit, complete
with cape. Another one ran
wearing a buffalo head, while a
third ran all 26 miles in a ballet
tutu. There is even a guy who

every year runs the entire
course backwards. I hear he
gets a lot of neck pains.”’
Despite scattered criticism of
relatively minor aspects, all the
W&L runners came away with
only good feelings about the
race and the people involved.

“There is a tremendous feel-
ing of camaraderie which ex-
ists,’ Engel said. ‘‘You are in a
large crowd of runners, where
everyone is willing to help
everyone else. There is no
pressure when you are in a
crowd, because there’s always
someone to run with.”’

Schwab observed, “‘To run in
the Boston Marathon is a big
ego trip, and lots of fun. It sure
was more enjoyable than giving
a Mineralogy lecture.”’

Each of the four runners in-
tends to compete in next year’s
Boston Marathon. It seems that
running that famous course
gives them a special feeling, to
be experienced only once a

year. Perhaps the candid
Schwab summed it up best
when he said, ‘‘After the sense
of elation I experienced when I
completed the Boston
Marathon, it’s tough to readjust

_to life as a mild-mannered

Geology professor.”

W&L Third In Track Championship

by John Cleghorn
Last Saturday, April 25, the
ashington and Lee track and
‘Id team participated in the
inual ODAC championship at
‘idgewater College. At the end
the day, Bridgewater emerg-
| as the outdoor champion by a
ide margin, followed by
mchburg in second place and
&L in a close third. With this
lish Bridgewater continued
sir dominance of the Old

minion Athletic Conference, ‘

nning this year by an im-
essive 70 points.

‘We ran about as well as we
ld,” said head coach Norris

dridge. ‘It was tough
cause this was the
idgewater Coach’s last

)AC championship, and there
re a lot of alumni there in
sport. . Consequently, the
idgewater team was very
ed up for the meet.”’

Auch of Bridgewater’s suc-
is can be attributed to one
m member. Duane Harrison
ced first in two running
nts and three field events,
ere he tied the conference
‘ord in the long jump. ‘‘He’s
outstanding athlete,’”’ com-

mented Aldridge, ‘I’m just
glad he’s a senior.”’
In other field action,

Washington and Lee’s Gene
Fellin finished as the ODAC
pole vault champion. Fellin was
impressive in his victory, com-
ing off a badly turned ankle the
day before the meet. In addition
to winning the ODAC, Fellin’s
vault also broke the school
record which had been held
since 1954. Coach Aldridge
maintained that Fellin

“could’ve gone higher.’’ Eric
Nelson threw his best in the
discus, placing second in the
conference behind
Bridgewater’s Harrison, who
also won the high jump in addi-
tion to the long jump. John
McKee and Charlie Alcorn plac-
ed second and fourth in the shot
put, respectively, which was
won by Bridgewater.

In the running events,
freshman Keith Kadesky plac-

ed third in the 100-meter dash.
R.J. Scaggs finished third in the
400-meter, and Alan Armitage
also took third in the 110 high
hurdles, a race won by
Bridgewater’s standout, Har-
rison. Scaggs also took third

and W&L’s Billy Morris fourth
in the 440-spring relay. Paul
Chapman placed third in the

880. In the distance events,
freshman Angus McBride
finished a strong second in the

1600, and the W&L mile relay
team comprised of R,J. Scaggs,
Billy Morris, Keith Kadesky,
and Paul Chapman took second,
witha time of 3:29.51.

When asked about the season
overall, coach Aldridge noted
several bad breaks. ‘‘The last
meet we had was on April 30th.
When we came back from
break, the meet with Lyn-
chburg was cancelled. So, we
went into ODAC having run our

last meet almost a month

factor was the weather,
Aldridge remarked. ‘‘We
haven’t had good weather all
year long. The ODAC was the
same way. It was cold and win-
dy, so it was difficult to deter-
mine our progress.”’

Coach Aldridge was not mak-
ing excuses, though, and is op-
timistic about next year. ‘“‘The
outlook is encouraging. This
team only graduates four
seniors, leaving a very young
and talented team.”

Bridgewater has dominated,

given the Generals a chance to

Aldridge notes, “This meet

gives us a chance to come back

victory. We’ve always schedul-
ed this meet to keep up the

rivalry between the two
schools. We always enjoy run-

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Constitutional Chaos

Monday night’s EC meeting witnessed a great

 

 

Shoe Meets M. inks. i

1

 

Y/

FE
ip

debate over the constitutionality of a motion, pro-
posed by Senior Law Representitive Jeff Edwards, to
move the Freshman Law representative elections
from October to September. Although the motion
eventually passed, it did so only after drawn-out
disputes over the problems and possible repercus-
sions of altering the constitution without an amend-
ment approved by the student body.

The question at issue should not be whether to
adhere to the letter of the constitution, or to modify it
for the sake of practicality. Rather, the issue of con-
stitutionality must consider the intent of the framers
when it was written.

Looking back to that time, we see that both law and
undergraduate divisions followed concurrent calen-
dars. However, today this is no longer the case, with
the law school beginning almost an entire month
earlier than the undergrads.

It seems apparent that the constituion stipulated
the third week of October for EC elections to allow
freshmen of both schools time to adjust to their new
environments. It is extremely doubtful, at least in the
opinion of this newspaper, that there was anything
sacred or magical about elections in that third week.

Therefore to insist that elections take place at that
exact time is entirely missing the intent of that the
framers envisioned for the constitution.

Willis, Mackie and others who fear that this inter-
pretation of the constitution may be potentially
dangerous need not worry. The Ring-tum Phi is
always near, and we watch the EC’s every move.

The EC is commended for passage of this important
motion. It is always a good thing when justice tri-
umphs over mere law.

POINT/

COUNTERPOINT

 

 

POINT
By John Vlahoplus

y Mobil Oil, in a series of thinly
veiled parables, has undertaken
a major new media campaign
to push the traditional big
business — small government
view of economic organization.
The Grace Company is selfless-
ly and patriotically supporting
the president’s tax program by
running full page ads in
newspapers and carrying on a

running feud with the
Washington Post over the ef-
fects of the proposal.

Some of Mobil’s efforts have
been rejected by the networks
as too controversial, but after a
decision hailed by the company
as a victory for free speech,
some of them are now being
allowed on the air during cer-
tain restricted hours. Perhaps
these ads have as yet reached
few people, but the conse-
quences of allowing them to be
carried are nonetheless great.

Applying the right of freedom
of speech to a corporation is an
affront to men, in whom alone
reside inalienable rights. Cor-
porations receive through
charters’ only _ privileges
granted at the discretion of
men. Allowing them the
privilege of political advertis-
ing concentrates political power
in the hands of a few, forces de
facto government subsidies of
corporate political messages,
and denies stockholders the
right to use their share of the
company’s profits to support
their particular political
causes.

Modern advertising requires
a great deal of money, far more
than the average political
organization has available dur-
ing any time but election years.
But multi-billion dollar corpora-
tions like Mobil and Grace have
readily available ad budgets
that allow a constant media
presence.

Even if a group with opposing
views receives ‘‘equal time’ to
respond, it is extremely doubt-
ful that it could raise the money
needed to produce and run a
commercial. A concentration of
money leads to a concentration
of power, and at present very
few corporations control a
dominant share of the nation’s
wealth. But corporate political
ads do more than create a
dangerous concentration of
power — they also force those
who hold different political
views to help pay for the ads.

The corporations involved of
course deduct their advertising
costs as expenses. This allows
them to write off almost half of
the cost of the ads from their
tax bills. The effect is that the
government loses revenues,
and it (read you and I) sub-

sidizes the political opinions of
the members of the boards of
directors of those major cor-
porations.

When I see a Grace ad implor-
ing us all to be patriotic and get
behind President Reagan’s tax
plan I get an irritated and
helpless feeling knowing that
almost half of the cost of that ad
is being borne by the federal
government itself. This is an in-
direct way of forcing others to
subsidize controversial political
positions. The corporations in-
volved also directly force some
to ‘subsidize their political
advertising.

The people affected in this
case are, of course, the real
owners of the corporation — the
stockholders. The profits of
these firms belong to them, not
to some executive who wants to
preach laissez-faire. These peo-
ple have the right to receive
their dividends and to then
spend them as they see fit.

 
    
 
   

If they want to contribute toa
political party or a political ac-
tion committee so be it. But let
them “vote” in the political
market with their dollars just
as much as they “vote” in the
goods and services market with
those same dollars.

The corporate structure is in-
herently unfit for fair competi-
tion in the arena of political
advertising. A  corporation’s
owners are many with no prac-
tical control over the advertis-
ing policies of the firm. The
companies enjoy limited liabili-

vty, a grant of special privilege

not enjoyed by other
polemicists. We saw the abuses
that occurred with corporate
bribes and ‘“‘campaign contribu-
tions’”’ in the past two decades.
We needn’t allow much the
same thing to happen again.
Corporate privileges can
—and in this case must — be

Wi, Beaarieve. You May WANE
SEEN ME on oe

reined in in the interests of
political freedom. Mobil’s ads
may seem cute and harmless,
but they still carry a controver-
sial political viewpoint — and I
(and many stockholders and
other taxpayers) resent having
to help pay for them.

COUNTERPOINT
By Kevin Dwyer

 

Major American corporations
like Mobil Oil, Smith/Kline
Pharmaceuticals, and W.R.
Grace and Co. have become
more highly visible on the
American scene than before;
certainly part of the reason for
this has been the increase in the
number of ads run by these cor-
porations. Ads for products are
not new.

The which

ads find

themselves in controversy are

 

Fwy

ads. Some are alarmed by these
ads, and Mr. Vlahoplus_ has.
summarized some of the wor-
ries in his piece. Unfortunately
these lucidly-stated proposals
do not survive close scrutiny.

Vlahoplus makes three major
complaints with regard to the
ads. First, that they improperly
concentrate ‘‘political power in
the hands of a few.”’ Second, he
frets that current law “forces
de facto government subsidies
of corporate political
messages.”’

Finally, Mr. Vlahoplus claims
that such ads_ deny
“stockholders the right to use
their share of the company’s
profits to support their par-
ticular political causes.’’ Let us
address these issues in their
course.

First, these ads do no such
thing as concentrate political
power in the hands of a few.

the self-promotion or so-called
(see Mr. Vlahoplus) “‘political”’
vocating its interests. As a ma-
jor taxpaying entity, surely this
corporation should be permit-
ted to express its opinion on an
issue of national concern,
especially one which so vitally
impacts upon itself!

An analogy I believe to be
valid follows:

1. Grace sees Reaganomics in
its own best interest.

2. Procter and Gamble sees
increased sales of Crest in its
own best interest.

3. Both corporations produce
advertising designed to sway
public support and opinion:
Grace in the direction of
Reaganomics, Procter and
Gamble in Crest’s direction,
away from, let’s say, Colgate.

But wait, you cry. Dwyer’s
admitted Grace is trying to
sway public opinion; isn’t this a
concentration of political power

hd, Ili

in the hands of a few? I would
have to answer ‘“‘no,’’ especially
in light of the largely anti-
business attitude of the media
in recent years.

Far more people hear the
“scandalous and obscene”’ pro-
fits story than see Mobil’s ads.
If anything, the broadening of
the rights of corporation to
advertise in this way will help
keep in balance the “‘business-
is-bad”’ philosophy rampant in
media, academia, and the
popular mind.

Business pay taxes, they
should be able to speak out. Ex-
tension of free speech to oor-
porations is ‘‘an affront to
men”? Why? Is it because cor-
porations are wealthy institu-
tions, not people with limited
Corporate campaign contribu-
tions are expressly forbidden;
all W.R. Grace wants to do is

show that it believes that the:

The Legitimacy Of Corporate
Financing Of Political Advertising

Reagan economic plan is a) the
best course for America and is
b) also the best course for the
well-being of W.R. Grace and
Co.

This campaign is no mad
power grab; W.R. Grace is ad-
resources? If so, then the
churches and the labor unions ;
also wealthy institutions, not in-
dividuals, must be similarly
“reined in.”’

Would Mr. Vlahoplus agree? I
doubt it. Perhaps he just
mistrusts American corpora-
tions...I’m sorry, but that is an
inadequate reason to limit free
speech.

The other two charges are
easily dismissed if one accords
corporations the right to speak
out. On government subsidies:
If W.R. Grace, Smith/Kline,
Rockwell International, United
States Steel, et al, do not pro-
duce (in many cases) a Crest,
Clorox, Kleenex or other readi-
ly available consumer product,
such advertising is an excellent
means of obtaining public good
will.

Procter and Gamble can do it
with a product like Crest;
Rockwell cannot. It produces
the space shuttle, hardly a con-
sumer item. So it designs
patriotic ‘‘Congratulations,
America!” ads after the shut-
tle’s success. Why is this adver-
tising (or Mobil’s explaining its
profits, or Grace’s on
Reaganomics) somehow _in-

_ valid and therefore not entitled

to be considered deductible as
“expenses” like the ads for
Crest?

| Even if the so-called
“‘political”’ ads produce a shift
on an issue (Reaganomics,
shall we say), what is wrong
| with that? Grace advertising is
‘all business-related, even if on
| Reaganomics, and is therefore

legitimate ‘“‘expenses.”’

And, if W.R. Grace
stockholders disagree, they can
expel the board and chairman,
or force a binding policy vote at
a_ stockholders’ meeting to
change such ads, or abolish
them. This is done often and
successfully on questions of
trade (South Africa, communist
countries, etc.). So could it be
that stockholders in general
wholeheartedly concur?
Hmmm...

 

No one wants to return to the
abuses of the Nixon era with
regard to corporate involve-
ment in the political process.
But advertising by corporations
of this kind is not a step on the
way to that unhappy situation.
If subject to the same standards
of truth (i.e., no lying or libel,
etc.) of other advertising, this
phenomenon is just another
healthy expression of
America’s pluralism.

EC Debates Constitution Interpretations

(continued from page 1)
never ‘‘blatantly overturned”’
the constitution before.

“Do you want to weigh the
constitution, which isn’t follow-
ed anymore, against the rights
of law students?’ asked
president-elect Eric Myers.

“The constitution isn’t worth
the paper its printed on,” con-
tinued Myers, citing the office
of treasurer as an example of
the EC violating the letter of the
constitution. The EC has no
bonded, salaried treasurer,
despite Section XI, which sets
up the office. :

Actually, replied Willis, they

just “‘rubber-stamp’’ the
University’s choice of
treasurer. University

Treasurer Stewert Epley, and
assistant Louis Snyder, are the
bookkeepers for the EC.
Edwards’ first motion allow-
ed the first year law represen-
tative to stay in office until
replaced in October. When Law
Representative Mike Nogay
and Hale changed their vote
from abstention to nay, this fail-

Edwards next moved that
Section XI’s “The Executive
Committee shall provide for
other elections as become
necessary,” be interpreted as a
catch-all, including first year
law representative. The elec-
tions could thus be held in
September.

After Edwards noted that the
change would be subject to the
approval of next year’s EC, the
motion passed 6-4.

Mackie and others maintain-
ed that such an interpretation
was illegitimate. They noted the
clause preceding the special
elections clause, that said ‘‘the
general election for the
undergraduate freshman and
freshman law class shall be on
the third Monday in October...”’

“A constitution should trans-
cend time,” replied Edwards,
“and our constitution has failed
to do this. When the constitution
doesn’t apply, are we bound to
it?”

As the meeting closed,
Mackie declared that the pro-

A Ap an ent

ceedings were ‘‘void’’ because
the motion was out of order in
that the freshman law elections
were not special and the motion
thereby directly contravened
the constitution.

“Obviously the law students
don’t feel their rights are being
too grossly violated or they
would have turned out in higher
numbers for the referenda,”
Mackie said later.

On a university-wide ballot
last November was a constitu-
tional ammendment to move
the date of the freshman law
election up closer to the begin-
ning of the year. This and ten
other amendments were ap-
proved, but by only 22 percent
of the student body. The con-
stitution requires 50 percent for
passage.

Referendums have been held
several times this year to am-
mend and revise the outdated
and ambiguous sections of the
constitution. Despite their keep-
ing three to five polls open for
three days per referendum, the
EC has yet to get a majority of

“Changing the constitution by
committee,’ commented Willis
after the meeting, “‘erodes the
foundation of student
government—the students see
that it doesn’t matter whether
they vote or not.”’

“If you can’t convince the
students that (revising the con-
stitution) is a burning issue,
then I think you have to live
with the constitution the way it
is,’’ said Willis. ‘‘I have failed to
convince them; now it is up to
Eric’s committee.”’

Responding to criticism that
Edwards’ interpretation of the
special election clause was ab-
surd, Eric Myers said after the
meeting, “it may be an absurd
way (to interpret it), but it is a
practical way.

“In the short run, I think
motion will be in the best in-
terests of the law students,”
said Myers.

“At a time like’ this, the
students should realize they are
being penalized by their con-
Stitution,’” the junior EC
member concluded.

two sophomore positions. The
election will be held Monday,
May 4, and runoffs on Thurs-
day, May 8.

The EC set a $10 spending
limit, and candidates may hang

fifteen posters and one banner.
Subcommittee reports were

then heard from the Student Ac-
tivities Board, the Cold Check
Committee, the Calyx and the
Ring-tum Phi.

Pryse Elam, co-chairman of
the SAB, noted that this year’s
Fancy Dress spent $8558.46 over
what it took in. This was ap-
proximately equivalent to the
cost of the Fancy Dress
weekend’s John Prine concert.

Mike Malesardi, chairman of
the Cold Check Committee, re-
quested a loan to meet the unex-
pectedly high amount of bounc-
ed checks. His committee was
lent $300 until commencement.

Peter Eliades, editor of the
Calyx, explained that the year-
books should be in by May 22.
He is planning a dedication for
that date, and distribution

afterwards.
Trent Dickerson, business

manager of the Ring-tum Phi,
noted that advertisers had been

good about paying bills.
