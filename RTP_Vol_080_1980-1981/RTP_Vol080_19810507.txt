Fire Damages Pi Kappa Phi

by Tom Baker

A fire at the Pi Kappa Phi
fraternity house last Saturday
afternoon injured four firemen,
gutted the attic, and brought
water damage to the first and
second floors.

Two of the firemen passed out
due to excessive heat and
smoke inhalation, while the two
other firemen received minor
injuries while fighting the fire.

Clyde Harkrader, president
of Pi Kappa Phi, was not sure
how the fire started. He said on-
ly two fraternity members and
a band setting up for a party
that night were present when
the fire started at about 4:30
p.m. Harkrader was only cer-
tain that the fire started in the
attic.

As a result of the fire, most of
those living in the house have
moved into apartments with
other Pi Kappa Phis or into
university housing. Also, the
house’s electrical system was
burned out so the kitchen is
useless. They are now eating in
Evans Dining Hall.

Sophomore Steve Geary
credited Dean John and Gerald
Darrell, director of the univer-
sity food services, for their help
in promptly relocating frater-

nity members and setting up
their meal program. He said the
fraternity was thankful to the
Kerrs Creek, Buena Vista and
Lexington Fire Departments
and Buena Vista and Lexington
Rescue Squads for aiding in put-
ting out the fire.
The fraternity’s

company had not totalled the
damages to the house as of
Tuesday afternoon, but junior
Mark Altermatt said that a con-
tractor has been contacted and
repairs are expected to begin

The Lexington Fire Depart-

ment is investigating the fire.

Committee Explores Learning Climate

“There is a general concern,”
explained Dr. Sidney Coulling,
“that the students fritter away a
lot of time, that they read with a
course outline but nothing more,
that there is a lack of intellectual
seriousness,

By a majority of two to one,
the faculty began this academic
year by appointing an ad hoc
committee on liberal education.
As the year now closes, the
committee is preparing its
recommendations for the presi-

“There seems to be a general

‘About every ten years a

EC Given Final Draft
Of White Book Proposals

by W. Cope Moyers

In preparation for discussing
possible changes in the White
Book Thursday (today), the Ex-
ecutive Committee Monday
night received the final draft of
the proposed changes.

Senior EC representative Jim
Vines briefly outlined the new
revisions, which range from
simple changes in wording to a
complete rewriting of the in-
troduction and philosophy of the
honor system. Vines said most
of the proposed changes simply
consolidate the old wording.

“The changes basically
follow the same outline as the
current book,”’ Vines said.

Before anv changes to the
White Book can be im-
plemented, half of the Ex-
ecutive Committee first must
approve the changes, followed
later by a second vote. Two-
thirds of the committee must
then approve the changes on the
second vote. a
will begin deliberations on the
revisions Thursday afternoon,
with the possibility that
changes to the White Book
might, at that time, be im-
plemented.

In other business, the com-
mittee heard monthly financial
reports from the Student Bar

waeewrhd

Association and Ariel. Andrew
Trotter, co-editor of Ariel,
reported that the Spring edition
should be distributed during the
week before final exams. About
900 copies of the 32-page edition
are expected to be distributed
at a cost of $900.

Trotter also said the Publica-
tions Board will accept applica-
tions for editor of next year’s
Ariel until Friday.

Hop Xing of the SBA reported
to the committee that about $775
remains in this year’s general
fund. Xing said that the SBA
final report will probably not
differ much from the May
report, and that money remain-
ing in some committees will be
credited to the general fund.

EC president Bob Willis an-
nounced the winners for next
year’s University Council. Mike
Singer is the sophomore repre-
sentative, John Buttarazzi is
the junior member, and Eric
Kolts the senior representative.
Remaining positions will be
decided in Thursday’s runoff.

Senior committee member
Marshall Clark suggested that
the EC send a letter to the Lex-
ington Volunteer Fire Depart-
ment thanking them for ex-
tinguishing Saturday’s fire at
the Pi Kappa Phi house.

Cartoonist MacNelly Speaks

by Todd Smith

“If you're going to be a
political cartoonist, you have to
be totally cynical,’ explained
Jeff MacNelly, speaking to a
crowded Lee Chapel Monday
night.

‘Tam just nasty.”

Cartoonist for the Richmond
News Leader, MacNelly led the

audience on a cartoon tour of

the Carter administration,
among other things, at the
Contact-sponsored lecture.

MacNelly is well-known for
his comic strip ‘“‘Shoe"’, about a
newspaper staff of birds. The 32
year-old cartoonist used an
overhead projector to show
some of his syndicated artwork
as well as draw Shoe and
‘‘Perfesser”’ on the spot.

“The Perfesser is more
autobiographical than any of
the characters,’ said MacNel-
ly. ‘He's sort of an aging prep-
pie.”

‘Nobody understands my
cartoons. I feel like I'm in a 20th
century literature course —
every once in a while someone
comes up to me and says, “I've
got it, the perfesser is Henrv
and the tree is

One of his cartoons depicted
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter
as the class dunces. “This car-

toon shows how well you can use
children to represent national
leaders, if you can’t find rep-
tiles touse.”’

‘IT don't think I was cut out for
this business,’ said the two-
time Pulitzer winner. ‘I don’t
go for the jugular."’

MacNelly cannot see himself
as a crusader, the whole world
of politics is just too
“hilarious.”

‘My job is to come up with
something more ridiculous than
reality.”’

Delts Placed On Social Pro By IFC

by Steve Perry

Delta Tau Delta was placed
on a mandatory two weeks
social probation by the IFC
Tuesday night, following a noise
violation conviction by the local
authorities.

On April 29, the Lexington
police filed a complaint stating
that the party at Delta Tau
Delta was too loud. The law
States that if amolified music
can be heard from a distance of
more than fifty feet, a noise
violation has been committed.

The police then arrested
Delta Tau Delta president, Rich
Silberstein, and proceeded to
break up the party.

IFC representative, Lou
Close, stated that the Delts
were charged’ with both com-
mitting a noise violation
and not having a noise permit.
He added that the Delts, and
any other fraternity were
unable to obtain a noise permit
because it was held on a
weeknight.

and a Delt member, stated that
three other fraternities were at
the party, and he did not think
that the Delts alone should be
held responsible for the noise
violation. Vetterlein added that
the police tested the house for a
possible noise violation from on-
ly 20 feet, instead of 50 feet as
the law requires.

Delta Tau Delta will appeal
the decision to the Student Af-
fairs Committee in hopes of
having the two weeks social
probation rescinded. Their ap-

peal is based on a precedent set
recently by Sigma Phi Epsilon,
which states that if a fraternity
has not been placed on social
probation for a long period of
time, they may attempt to have
the penalty lifted on the basis of
their good record.

Phi Delta Theta and Sigma
Nu were also given two weeks
social probation for failing their
house inspection. Phi Delta
Theta plans to appeal to the
SAC.

Film Notes

_ J vitelloni (Italy, 1953): A Federien Fellini film, winner of the
1953 Silver Lion of Venice, The Layabouts is a tale of youth on the
coast. In other words, an Italian beach bum film (imagine
Lifeguard with subtitles). Fellini claims it is a fun film with no
message; critics tend to find deep philosophical meaning in it.
Worth the time, though — especially with what’s in town. Thurs-
day, May 7th, Reid 203; free. Single showing, 8 pm.

Shoot the Piano Player (France, 1960): Francois Truffaut’s New
Wave film is a reaction against the Maltese Falcon type of detec-
tive and detective film. He calls it his ‘gangster fairy tale.’ French
singer Charles Aznavour stars. Tuesday, May 12th, 7 and 9 pm,
Reid 203. No charge.

Blazing Saddles : another madcap Mel Brooks film which we’ve

all seen and intend to see again. And again. The West was never
this Wild — but don’t you wish it was? Starts Friday at the Lyric.

Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Gore without Vidality. A schlock
horror film dredged from the cutting room floor. Tess is delayed
and this is the stopgap, which brings us to the question, ‘Must the
essa go on?’ Starting F'riday at the State.

Spring
Parties
‘Planned

A succession of spring parties
is planned by ‘just about
everyone who can throw one
and has a reason — or an ex-
cuse. The result is likely to be
four Saturdays in a row that end
with a bang and four Sundays
devoted to whimpering.

The Cockpit will continue to
host ‘name’ bands and similar
SAB entertainment. But the in-
novative aspect of the term-
long party jokingly referred to
as ‘W&L Spring Semester’ is the
responsibility of the IFC and the
organizers of the upcoming
lacrosse rally that precedes this
week’s W&L - UNC clash.

The ‘Stomp the Heels’ party,
the main ingredients of which
are fifteen kegs of beer, many
decibels of taped music, and
school spirit (to: taste), is
scheduled for Saturday, May
9th, from 1:30 to 4:30 in the
afternoon.

The IFC-sponsored Fabulous
Thunderbirds concert is set for
Saturday the 15th from 4 to 7:30
p.m. The concert on the 15th is
to be held in the gym parking
lot, and it is suggested that you
not park there that day. The
concert schedule and an an-
nouncement of the special
guests likely to attend will be
printed in next week’s issue of
the Ring-tum Phi.

Finally, back at the Pit, the
All-Stars hit Big Lex on Thurs-
day, and May 13th sees rock and
roll from Creeds.

And if that’s not enough
partying for you, you know
where the brew stores are.

‘;

Dr. Pusey in class.

to serving on numerous faculty
committees.

Despite his many activities, .

he has no doubts as to what his
most rewarding experience at
W&L has been: ‘teaching

students.”’ Pusey cites his prin-
cipal objective in teaching as

that ‘‘students learn and as far

as possible enjoy it (learning)
(but not vice versa ).”’

His enthusiasm for teaching
has only one reservation —
grading papers, a task “‘which
requires more willpower every
year.”

In addition to teaching, Pusey
is also proud of his scholarly
work and of the many ad-
vancements which were made
during his term in the ad-
ministration. When he came to
W&L in 1939, he was interested
in comparative literature. The
tide of world events, however,
led him to publish Readings in
Military German, a book which

enjoyed great popularity until |

the end of World War II.

After serving in the Navy dur-
ing WWII, Pusey returned to
W&L and focused his research
on American literature in Ger-
many. The late Ollinger Gren-

shaw, a former professor of
history at W&L, provoked
Pusey’s interest in what is his
current field of study, the in-
tellectual and social history of
this area. He has written
numerous articles including one
to appear in the upcoming issue
of the Rockbridge Historical
Society Proceedings.

Pusey likes the close relation-
ship between administration
and faculty members at W&L
that does not exist at colleges

that hire professional ad-

ministrators. He stresses that
all the accomplishments made
when he was part of the ad-
ministration were ‘cooperative
undertakings.”’ Those which he
is proudest of include the ap-
pointment and retention of
superior faculty members, the
expansion in the number of
courses offered, and the re-
vamping of the distribution re-
quirement system.

Pusey remained in the
classroom during his ad-
ministration years, teaching
elementary Russian. Since that
time he has taught mostly
elementary German, elemen-
tary Russian, and a com-
parative literature course.

Over the years, however, he
has taught every course offered
by the German department,
and was once even called on to
teach Norwegian, a language in
which he claims to have no pro-
ficiency. He managed, never-
theless, by. remaining one
lesson ahead of the student who
requested it.

In his forty-two years of
teaching at W&L, Pusey has not
observed any decline in student
intelligence. In fact, Pusey
believes that, while they may
not have as much specific
knowledge as students of the
past, students today possess a
better background. Whereas
there may be a decline in

Dr. Pusey as acting President in 1967-1968 greets soon-to-be Presi-
dent Richard M. Nixon at the Mock Convention,

knowledge of the English
language, he believes it is due to
lack of exposure and does not
fault the students.

In retirement, Pusey plans to
continue his research into local
history and to work part-time in
the library’s special collections.
He will also be able to spend
more time hiking, which he en-
joys. (He is trailmaster for the
Rockbridge Fox-Stick Hiking
Club). He will also continue his
work as one of the directors of
the local League of Women
Voters and plans to travel with
his wife.

Pusey is optimistic about the
future of W&L. He sees
“something special’ here at
W&L. He says, ‘‘Washington
and Lee, when I arrived in 1939,
was friendly, as it is now.’’ He
believes that W&L can and will
maintain its ‘air of civility”
and the harmonious relations
among admrnistration, faculty
and students which made it
prosper in the past and will
cause it to prosper in the future.
Pusey only has one regret — he
says that he will miss the
classroom. And sadly, the feel-
ing is mutual.

Curriculum Question Raised

(continued from page 1)
rard and Sessions, its members
include Dr. John Handleman,
Dr. Thomas Williams, and
students Winston Burks, Craig

Albanese, Howard Herndon,
Willie Mackie, and Frank
Williams.

Meeting almost every week,
the committee has addressed
several aspects of the intellec-
tual climate on campus, in and
out of the classroom:

Housing: do living §ar-
rangements contribute to the
“fragmentation” of the student
body, or to the isolation of non-
fraternity members?

Athletics: to what extent do
athletics enhance or encumber
a Student’s education?

Coeducation: is a_ sexually
diverse student body necessary
to the liberal education, and
does this University have a
healthy mix of race and creed,
in addition to sex?

Curriculum: are distribution
requirements adequate in
giving the students a broad
background?

The curriculum question is
closest to the main concern of

‘‘What
accor-

the committee, which is,
kind of school is this?’’
ding to Sessions.

‘“‘We ought to reevaluate the
way we're going,”’ stated Hern-
don. *‘Do we want to become
professionals in college, or gain
the broad base that lets us go in-
to anything?”’

“There is a general concern
that the students fritter away a
lot.of time,’ explained Coull-
ing to the Phi, “‘they read within
the course outlines, but nothing
more. There seems to be a lack
of intellectual seriousness,
almost an anti-intellectual at-

titude among students.
“By intellectual attitude I
don’t mean_ solemnity,

bookishness or pedantry, but
the real pleasure in education
for its own sake,”’ said Coulling.

“The chief problem is the
fragmentation of the student
body,”’ said the English depart-
ment head, who lamented the
lack of the ‘“‘unifying force that
was present in his days as an
undergraduate.

“I saw a first rate perfor-
mance at the University
Theater last year and the

theater was half-full — I call
that scandal!’’ Coulling con-
tinued, ‘‘There are more oppor-
tunities than ever. I will not
argue that the students are bet-
ter than they were, or that the
faculty and courses are better,
but the facilities have been im-
proved to such a degree that
they are unrecognizable from
what they were 25 years ago.

“T think the lack of common
pursuit among our students is
related to our fragmented socie-
ty, in some measure,” said
Coulling.

Sessions also sees unity as a
critical problem for the intellec-
tual climate of the atmosphere.
He noted that the purpose of the
University, spelled out in the
catalogue, includes stressing
the student’s ‘‘harmonious rela-
tionship with his fellow man,
and his responsibility to serve
society through the product of
his training and talent.”

The ‘payoff’ of general,
liberal education, according to
Sessions, is not a vocational
talent, but “‘the type of person
produced.”

“‘We don’t ask how all this fits
together, how does this con-
tribute to the public good?”’
noted Sessions.

“It is not the liberation of the
individual as an individual that
makes sense, but the liberation
of the individual in a communi-

ty.”

Sports

Rock, Smith

Named All

Washington & Lee University
freshman Tim Rock and Don
Smith, both residents of San An-
tonio, Texas, have received All-
America recognition from the
College Water Polo Coaches’
Association and from Water
Polo Review, the official
publication for United States
amateur water polo. They are
W&L's first All-America per-
formers in the sport.

Rock was named to the se-
cond team by each organiza-
tion. He finished the 1980 season
with 34 goals, third on the team.
In addition to the water polo
laurel, Rock earned All-
America recognition in swim-
ming by finishing fifth in the
1650-yard freestyle event at the
March, 1981 NCAA Division III
Championships. He is believed
to be W&L’s first athlete to earn
A-A recognition in two sports.

Smith was selected first-team
All-America by the Coaches’
Association and honorable men-
tion by Water Polo Review. He
recorded 29 goals last fall,
fourth on the varsity.

-American

“These awards will be
beneficial to Tom and Don as in-
dividuals and to our team as a
whole as we set goals for the
coming season,’ explained
head coach Page Remillard,
who this fall will enter his third
year as W&L aquatics director.
“Tim and Don would agree that
they have teammates worthy of
such awards, teammates who
may join them with awards in
the future.”

Prior to enrolling at W&L,
Rock and Smith played for
coaches George Block and Kurt
Swanson in San _ Antonio’s
Northside School District. “A
lot of what Tim and Don have
done at W&L thus far is due
chiefly to their development in
the San Antonio program,”’ of-
fered Remillard.

W&L finished the 1980 season
with a 17-14-0 record and a
sixth-place finish in the eight-
team Eastern Intercollegiate’
Championships. The 1981
schedule includes nine events,
four of which will take place in
W&L’s Cy Twombly pool.

Lewis Named Basketball
Assistant At GWU

by Ralph Frasca

Brad Lewis, a senior drama
major who served as_ Ad-
ministrative Assistant to W&L
basketball coach Verne Can-
field, was named Graduate
Assistant Coach with the
George Washington University
basketball team.

Lewis, from Washington,
D.C., was offered the job
several weeks ago by GWU
head coach Jerry Gimmelstob.
Gimmelstob was acting on the
advice of Red Auerbach, Presi-
dent and General Manager of
the Boston Celtics. Lewis
worked at Auerbach’s basket-
ball camp for the past two sum-
mers,

“It was because of Verne
Canfield’s influence that I
became’ interested in
coaching,” said Lewis. ‘‘I never
gave it a thought before I met
him.”

Lewis had applied for the
position of Graduate Assistant
at the University of Utah, the
University of Nevada-Reno, the
University of South Alabama,
and Davidson College before
landing the GWU post, and is
still under consideration at
those schools. However, Lewis
doubts that he will give up his
GWU assistantship, should any

Lax Team Nips Roanoke

Staging “the best comeback Re
I've ever been associated with”
according to head coach Jack
Emmer, the Washington and
Lee lacrosse team registered an

exciting 14-12 win over fourth- 4

ranked Division III power
Roanoke College last Saturday
on Wilson Field, before 4,143
fans. The victory, the team’s
third in a row, gave the
Generals a 6-3 record which
they take into a Sunday, May 19
contest in Chapel Hill against
the University of North
Carolina.

“You have to give credit to a

(a

 

,

“y @ ;

 

lot of inspired athletes for that Bigg

comeback,’ remarked Emmer
on the team’s fight from a 9-2
third-quarter deficit to an 11-9
fourth-quarter lead. ‘‘There
have been several times we
were down three or four goals
late in the game, but never by
seven goals, five minutes into
the third quarter. The last time
I saw a team do something
remotely similar was at
Cortland State, when we were
down 6-0 in the first quarter
against Cornell and wound up
winning 14-8.”

Roanoke’s 9-2 advantage
resulted from a 7-2 halftime
lead, created by good goaltend-
ing and fine attack play, mixed
with two scores early in the
third quarter. However, at that
point the Generals caught fire
to reel off nine unanswered
tallies -while holding the
Maroons scoreless for exactly
15 minutes.

Sen... .wiuiteider Geott Brent
started the burst, scoring three
straight goals to pull W&L up to
9-5. His efforts were followed by
scores from classmate John
Kemp, sophomore John Doub,
junior Mike Schuler, junior Rob
Staugaitis, Doub again, and
senior’ George Santos to give
W&L the 11-9 edge with 10:42
left.

The Maroons, though, caught
up at 11-11 midway through the
final quarter and again at 12-12
with 4’:43 left. But Brent, who
received the team’s Player-of-
the-Game honor, rose to the oc-
casion to score the game-
winner unassisted with 3:55
showing. Senior Jerry Broccoli
provided an insurance goal with
37 seconds left by stealing a

osike Schuler maneuvers against Roanoke.

racing in for an unassisted shot.

“We needed some positive
things to happen against
Roanoke if we were to do a good
job against North Carolina and
then UMBC in our final
games,” offered Emmer. ‘““The
guys realized at halftime that it
would be a long two weeks if
they lost. For them to make the
comeback, even after Roanoke
scored twice to open the third
quarter, is a sign of positive
thinking.”’

In the match against North
Carolina, a 2:00 p.m. contest on
Fetzer Field, W&L will face a
Tar Heel squad which holds an
8-0 record and _ second-place
ranking in this week’s USILA
Division I coaches’ poll. The

 

 

of the aforementioned schools
offer him a job.

As Graduate Assistant, Lewis
will be in charge of keeping the
scouting and recruiting files up
to date, take part in active
scouting and recruiting, and
will sit on the team bench dur-
ing all games. As a _ bonus,
Lewis will be allowed to take
one graduate course at GWU
per semester, paid for by the
school.

Lewis plans to earn a
Master’s Degree in Health-
Physical Education, an impor-
tant step towards his goal,
becoming the head basketball
coach of a major college team.
‘It’s almost impossible to pro-
gress in the coaching field
without a Master’s,”’ Lewis
noted.

GWU is a member of the
Eastern Eight basketball con-
ference.

Track Men End Season
With Bridgewater Loss

by John M. Cleghorn

On Friday May list, a day
marked by the cool weather
which has become a regular
feature of Washington and Lee
track meets this year, the
Generals fell to ODAC cham-
pions Bridgewater in a dual
meet. Although the Generals
lost, 92-50, closing their season
with a 4-3 record, several
athletes set personal records.

On the track, freshman Kevin
Kadesky took first place in both
the 100 and 200-meter events,
setting times of 11.0 and 22.30
respectively. In the 200-meter,
Kadesky defeated the con-
ference champion established
last week at the ODAC finals. In
the 5000-meter, senior Howard
Herndon ran his best time of
17:10:5, taking third behind
Bridgewater’s Don Denlinger
and W&L’s John Kelefant.

In the field there were also
several personal firsts.
Sophomore pole vaulter Gene
Fellin continued his marked im-
provement by breaking the
school record which he had tied
last week. By vaulting a height
of thirteen feet and nine inches,
Fellin broke a record held for 27
years. Junior John McKee
launched his best shot, a
distance of 44 feet 9 inches,
beating the mark set by the con-
ference champ last week.
Charlie Alcorn also set personal
records in both the shot and the
discus. Alcorn placed second in
the discus with a throw of
117’’6’, and third in the shot,
reaching 40’’6-1 2’.

Head coach Norris Aldridge
sighted the contribution of
several seniors. ‘‘R.J. Scaggs
and Billy Morris have both
given us a lot of points over
their four years. Howard Hern-

don and John Schmidt have also
worked hard for us and both
recorded their best efforts in
the meet with Bridgewater.”

Assistant coach Frank
Miriello also offered remarks
about the accomplishments of
his weight event athletes.
Mariello cited two shot putters,
John McKee and Charlie
Alcorn. “John only started
throwing in January. He has the
tremendous strength, quickness
and basic ability to give him
potential.’’ McKee won the in-
door conference shot competi-
tion.

‘Alcorn made a good transi-
tion to the 16-pound shot and
shows great promise for his re-
maining three years.’’ Miriello
also noted Alcorn along with
sophomore Eric Nelson for a
good future in the discus. “Eric
threw his best in ODAC last
week. He has improved five feet
from last year and has the flex-
ibility and throwing style to
become a 200-foot thrower. Both
Alcorn and Nelson are potential
record holders for W&L.”’ Gene
Fellin was noted for his poten-
tial as a pole vaulter. ‘Gene
was coming off a badly broken
wrist this year and had to
regain his style. We hope he
qualifies for national competi-
tion,” remarked coach Miriello,
“he has the chance to become
one of the better vaulters in
Division III track.”

The Generals will graduate
only four seniors, and thus
return with a great deal of
talent. Under the coaching of
Aldridge and Miriello and the
leadership of captains Mark
Shaver, Russ Rector and Alan
Armatage, the Generals pro-
mise to be a challenging team
next season.

The Washington and Lee

baseball team concluding its
season by losing both games, of
a doubleheader against
.rosstown rival VMI, 8-7 and
11-10. What made the one-run
defeats that much harder for
the Generals to take is the fact
that’ the victories tripled. the
Keydets’ win total for the year.
The two wins gave VMI a 3-35
record, while the Generals
finished at 10-14.

John Friend’s RBI single end-
ed the Keydets’ 32-game losing
streak, while teammate Mike
Eden had seven hits in eight at-
bats on the day, the most

significant being a two-run

single in the bottom of the
seventh to tie the opener, after
W&L scored three in the top half
of the inning. Jeff Haggerty and
Chris Cavalline belted homers
for the Generals.

VMI continued its’ winning
ways ‘in the nightcap with a

Hubbard's ' two-run homer,

th. Haggerty contributed his se-
cond four-bagger of the day and
eighth of the year, giving him
the ODAC home run title. The
second game saw the Generals

lose a 6-0 lead. First-year head ~

coach Craig Jones, a VMI
graduate, offered these com-
ments on the doubleheader:
“The first game was truly nip-
and-tuck, a good example of two
teams battling for the win. In
the second game, we had pitch-
ing trouble and ended up giving
away four or five runs on
passed balls. That was the
key.”’

Coach Jones was slightly
disappointed that his team lost

_ its’ lastseven.games after a 10-7

start, but was quick to point out
that progress has been made
since last year, when the
Generals were 5-21. ‘He also
believes that the Generals have
the potential to finish’ 500 or
over next season. -

Golfers End Season
Undefeated

The Washington an Lee
golfers, in their bid for an
undefeated season, travelled to
Ashland, Virginia Tuesday to
play Bridgewater and Randolf
-Macon colleges. At its conclu-
sion, the Generals found
themselves with twelve wins
and no losses on the season and
had captured the undefeated
record they had so conegly pur-
sued,

Jim Kaplan was medalist
with a stroke score of 74, while
senior co-captain Gerry
Barousse followed with a 76.
Junior co-captain Bill Alfano,
senior Steve Everett, and
freshman Bruce Blythe con-
tributed to the victory with
scores of 79, 80, and 82 respec-
tively.

Coach Buck Leslie was ob-
viously happy with the results.
“Those things don’t come too
often,’’ he remarked of the no

loss season record which the |

 

‘ senior

team compiled over the eight
week season.

Unfortunately the team failed
to gain a spot in the May 19
NCAA Division three champion-
ships. Upon special invitation
only the NCAA selection com-
mitee elected not to invite W&L
despite their twelve win, no loss
record. The chance to play in
the NCAA tournament was
something the Generals had
hoped for since the outset of the
season.

“The boys gave it a valiant
try,” said Leslie, and there still
remains a_ possibility that
co-captain Gerry
Barousse will be asked to play
as an individual member. In
any case with or without an
NCAA bid, the Washington and
Lee golf team has come a long
way. To put together an
undefeated record in any sport
is a remarkable feat, and one
which the Generals can be
proud of.

had turned those games around,
the record would have been
more indicative of the team we
had,’”’ he reasoned. “Back on
the positive side, next season
looks bright beoause we’re only
losing one player to graduation
(catcher Tom Coates).”

dication of the extent of the

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Grades, Girls
& Grad School

The intellectual atmosphere among students at
W&L is not what it has the potential to be. This is not
to say that students do not study. Most study very
hard. But there is a difference between our hard work
and our attitudes toward our work.

For many, our diligent study in the afternoon is
motivated by our desire to be ‘‘down the road”’ in the
evening. Our course selections are often based more
on the grades we hope to get, rather than on intellec-
tual challenge in order to improve ourselves.

And yet most of us came to W&L with high educa-
tional ideals and a sincere desire to learn. Unfor-
tunately, somewhere between orientation and
graduation we replace our desire to learn with a
desire to succeed.

This is understandable considering the competitive
nature and long tradition of success at W&L, but it is
not a fair exchange for our intellectual development.
The two can go together, but it takes a consciouis ef-
fort from the individual not to abandon one in favor of
the other.

Our four years at W&L should not merely be an
obstacle on the road to “better” things, but an oppor-
tunity to broaden our educational base. We need to
see our educational objectives in terms of developing
our minds, instead of just strengthening our GPAs.

If our objectives are only grades, girls and grad
schools, how can we hope to have a meaningful in-
tellectual experience? With our rising tuition costs,

we cannot afford to miss the educational oppor-
tunities W&L offers.

E.C. Interpretation Disputed

Dear Editor:

I write this letter in some
distress over the recent deci-
sion of the Executive Commit-
tee to forego the process of
amending the constitution, as
outlined in that document, in
favor of expediency. I refer to
the vote on law school elections
in which a majority of the E.C.
members voted to interpret a
section of the constitution in
what seems to have been bla-
tant disregard of a specific
clause within that document.
While I certainly empathize
with the E.C. members who are
so obviously frustrated by the
lack of student participation in
amendment votes taken in the

(ete eer

sy
re 7 d iat

~ a

  

penn
Sees, |

oe

past, I nonetheless believe that
it is an error to move in ways
which directly contravene the
constitution. Eric Myers is
quoted in the Phi as stating that
“The constitution isn’t worth
the paper it’s printed on.” If
this is true then why not
disregard the entire document
and rule by will...or by whim?

 
     

When I cast my ballot in any
election it is with the under-
standing that my duly elected
representatives will carry out
the duties of their office in obe-
dience to the constitution under
which they were elected to
serve. I still believe this to be
the case and encourage the E.C.
to reconsider its decision.

Let me just add in parting
that I greatly appreciate the
many long hours of selfless ser-
vice which the members of the
Executive Committee log in for
the benefit of the entire student —
body. Your time and your effort
are not in vain. Thanks.

Sincerely,
Keith E. Goretzka

Commentary By John Wells

Praise The Lord And Pass The Plate

How many of you out there in TV land find it dif-
ficult to choose between Carson, CBS movies and
rehashed ABC trash weeknights after 12? May I
suggest a new alternative (actually it isn’t new) at
this hour on channel 20, Monday through Friday,
the Fernwood 2nite of religious programming, the
PTL Club.

Please let me stress that I am not anti-religious
or anti-God, so I am not loath to criticize a pro-
gram which reduces Jesus to a painted lawn orna-
ment amid pink flamingoes and sea horse bird
baths. PTL, by the way, stands for Praise The
Lord.

The tone of the show is set at the beginning and
strangely resembles the opening of the Tonight
Show. The announcer, ‘‘Uncle’’ Henry Harrison,
reads over a drum roll and music ‘‘The PTL Net-
work is proud to present...Jim Bakkerrrrrrrrr!”’
as Jim and wife Tammy Faye walk onstage to
thunderous applause (the name of the show is no
longer officially “‘PTL”’ but ‘‘Jim Bakker’’).

Jim is not tall, pale, baby-faced with tip-tilted,
brown and most sincere eyes and a mouth that
looks like nothing as much as a monkey’s in a cer-
tain clinch. His hair is soft-looking and blown back
and he sports an impressive wardrobe of dacron
suits and sport coats. He looks like an aging altar
boy selling subscriptions. Actually, he makes a
never-ceasing sales pitch for PTL, his ministry
and the gospel.

By his side is the irrepressible Tammy Faye,
the pert gospel songtress from Minnesota with a
nasal twang. Tammy’s face is a _ burst of
brightness which may be attributed not to ra-
diance but rather a dense application of makeup.
Did I say dense? Well, I can’t decide if she looks
more like a circus clown or a truck stop waitress.

The color of her complexion ranges from show to
show; her mouth is painted jungle red far beyond
the boundaries of her actual lips; her eyes are
thickly lined to the point of resembling Cleopatra
(really) and the real eyebrows have been shaved
and new ones penciled in about an inch above the
originals.

A physical description does not do justice to this
enchanting woman, although it should be pointed
out that her parade of frocks has been a boon to the
women’s fashion division of K-mart. And while
we’re at it, her hairdo: it used to be enormous,
curly and immobile-looking. Now it’s short, black
and mousey brown (someone has advised her
about hairdos and hairdon’ts).

Following banter with the PTL orchestra leader
(no Carson drug jokes) is a monologue, which
usually includes ribbing Tammy (not physically)
about her weight problem; a cute and/or par-
ticularly touching letter to the couple leading to a
sermonic plea (demand?) for money and repen-
tance as Armageddon draws near.

Then the chit-chat begins in a semi-lavish off-
Williamsburg reproduction setting with tufted
velour wingbacks. I have reconstructed a typical
dialogue, with actual quotes from several shows,
to give you an idea of what it’s like. Jim’s in a
chair, Tammy and Uncle Henry on a couch.

(Most of what is printed below is taken directly
from past shows, many quotes are out of context
and some connecting dialogue has been made up
as representative of ordinary small talk on the
show. At least one quote was published last year in

Jim: Well, folks, the phones here at PTL have
been ‘“‘ringing off the hooks” as the old saying
goes. And all you folks at home have to do is pick

up your telephone and if you pledge $15 a month or
more (presumably until death), you’ll receive this
beautiful, big color book all about me, PTL and all
our friends. Now, I know some of you folks are
saying ‘Jim, I just can’t afford $15 a month!”
Well, I think you can.

Tammy: That’s right Jim, you know I had a gal
write a letter to me whose husband hated Chris-
tian programming and whenever it came on he’d
just blow up and go outside ’til one day she went to
the door and said, ‘‘Honey, c’mere, I think there’s
something on you’ll like,’’ and he came in and they
watched the show, and after it was over she said,
‘“‘Well?”’ and he said, ‘‘Well, I like that,” and it
was PTL! (applause) So she said, ‘‘Well, I’m glad
you like it, cause it’s only $15 a month!’’ and she
pledged! Isn’t that marvelous? Praise the Lord!

Jim: Praise God. And those of you who feel you
can’t pledge that $15 a month, a gift of $100 or
more will get you this full color PTL book.

Uncle Henry: Don’t forget about the $1000
pledge.

Jim: Yes, a pledge of $1000 or more will get you
the special edition vinyl-covered PTL bible — and
— this acrylic on velvet rendering of ‘“‘Jesus and
the Children.’’ Tammy and I take special pride in

the fact that our son, Jim Jr., was used as a model
for one of the children.

Tammy: That’s our little boy!

Jim: Now before I go into a detailed description
of the PTL book, I want to mention three other
items which may also be obtained for a monthly
pledge. First, there’s Tammy’s first album called
Tammy Faye that has ‘‘We’re Blessed”’ on it, then
there’s Tammy’s book, ‘‘I Gotta Be Me!,”’ a really
wonderful book...

Tammy: Thanks, honey.

Jim: And her newest record, called Tammy
Faye Bakker: The Lord is on My Side. Any of
those for a monthly pledge of $15 or more, friends,
PTL needs your money to stay on the air.

Tammy: Praise the Lord!

Uncle Henry: Amen, Jim, show them the book.

Jim: Well, here is the book that can be yours for

$15 pledge (displays book with full length picture
of Jim on the cover ). This is a beautiful book, have
you seen all the pictures? Look (camera close-up
of book): There’s Efrem Zimbalist, Jr...there’s
Pat Boone...there’s Roy Rogers and Dale
Evans...awww, looky there (close-up of Tammy
photo suggesting a cross between Lucy Ricardo
and Dr. Frank-n-furter)...and finally...(applause
erupts at Jim photo with high school senior infor-
mal picture-type scenic background). Well,
anyway, you folks at home will be proud to hang
these in your kitchen — or your barn (yuk yuk).
Well, I’ll bet Roy Rogers and Dale Evans wouldn't
mind being hung in the barn!

Tammy: I wouldn’t even mind if they hung me
in the barn!

Jim: That’s right! (laughter and scattered ap-
plause) Seriously, folks, we need your money to
keep PTL on the air and spread God’s word. We
want to make Him a part of your everyday life!

Tammy: Praise the Lord! You know Jim, when
you say everyday, I hope folks’ll listen, cause
Christ is with me everyday, everywhere! Why, I
even take him to the supermarket with me! I just

say, ‘Find mea bargain, Jesus!”’
* kK OK OK

The rest of the show contains ‘‘witnesses’* and
“testimony” by numerous guests, songs by the
PTL Choir (I have yet to hear my favorite
“religious pop” song heard once on the radio,
‘Jesus Was a Hell of a Man’) and more,
preaching. An _ uninterrupted hour’s worth,
sometimes two shows back to back.

The Bakkers seem to be unpolitical, at least
compared to the Rev. Jerry Falwell, but they like
to be associated with whoever happens to be presi-
dent. During the Carter administration, a solemn
Tammy sometimes appeared alone to announce
that Jim was breakfasting ‘‘at this very minute”’
with Jimmy in the White House. Since November,
however, Carter has been rarely, if ever, mention-
ed, and dusty photos of Jim with candidate Ronald
Reagan have been unearthed for inclusion in the
PTL book. Certainly, at least in style and deport-
ment, the Bakkers most nearly resemble the
Plains Gang.

On a spiritual level I can boast no high from the
proceedings as apparently hard core fans do. In-
tellectually, the level of the show speaks for itself
although one cannot underestimate the cunning of
Jim Bakker. He has taken a road show ministry
and transmuted it into a private TV network rival-
ing Jerry Falwell in. geographical scope and
influence. Hawking Jesus paintings does more
than keep Tammy in layers of Maybelline.

Well, obvioiusly, the show must be seen to be ap-
preciated. I’ve tried to separate the concepts of
God and Jim and attack only the preacher,
although I’m sure if he could read this Jim would
classify me as an instrument of Satan. I laugh at
the show, and if I feel badly about it, it’s not
because I think they don’t deserve it. Perhaps I
shouldn’t find humor in cheapening the image of
Christ, which is what PTL, intentionally or not, is
all about, in my opinion.
