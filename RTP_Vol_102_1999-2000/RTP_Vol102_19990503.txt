“You had no clue you were in Lexington”

Beautiful weather, gigantic tents, ice sculptures, satellite uplinks, and great lacrosse made the bicenquinquagenary special.

There are few tents in

Rockbridge County that have run-
ning water, two jumbotrons, chan-

of all of the past leaders of the stu-
dent body.

The show also included live per-
formances by W&L thespians, as
well as the University Chorus and
the W&L Jazz Ensemble.

One part of the show which has
raised questions among current stu-
dents was the video that was inter-
spersed throughout the perfor-
mance, as well as aspects of the
speeches of President John Elrod

and Rector of the Board of Trustees,
J. Frank Surface ’60.

Although some students said that
the video was “adequate”or

“alright,” many others referred to the
series of narrated clips as “bad

infomercials,” and “admissions vid-
eos.”

“I was expecting a Ken Burns
masterpiece,” said one junior, “what
we got was a cliched plea for alumni

money.”

Some students who saw the show
also said that the speeches of Elrod
and Surface made them feel uncom-
fortable in the presence of so many
Alumni. These students were con-
cerned that both the speeches and

“You had no clue you were in Lex-

After years of anticipation and
planning, the 250“‘ Anniversary Na-
tional Day of Celebration arrived on
Saturday, and more than 3,000
alumni, faculty and students en-

“I was very pleased with how well

One of W&L’s most famous alums comes to town to speak, sign and celebrate 250 years

By Heather McDonald

COPYEDITOR

Never was a white-suited man so anticipated at Wash-

,‘ ington and Lee.

Last Thursday, author and alumnus Tom Wolfe, ’5 1,
showed up in his signature white suit, signed books and
gave the keynote address for Reunion Weekend. Fa-
mous for his style of writing, New Journalism, and his

4. immensely popular two works of fiction, “Bonfire of the

Vanities and A Man in Full,’’ Wolfe’s books gamed a
huge crowd to his books signing and his speech. Stu-
d/ents, faculty, alumni and townspeople waited in line-
some for nearly three hours-to get Wolfe’s signature.
When the doors closed at 5:30 p.m., much of the line was
turned away.

The speech was held under the tent on Cap‘n Dick

Smith Field. Smith was Wolfe’s coach while during Wolfe’s
days as a Generals baseball pitcher. Wolfe started out
the speech with the anecdote about the time he came
back to W&L for Alumni Weekend and received an Hon-
orary Doctorate. The speaker described Wolfe as an out-
standing baseball player. After the event, Wolfe said to
Smith, “I bet you didn’t know who they were talking
about,” to which Smith replied, “Wolfe, you tried.”

Wolfe’s speech. entitled. “The End of the Century and
the Spirit of Washington and Lee,” focused on the impor-
tance of W&L’s liberal arts education. Saying that the
modern trend for specific, technologically-oriented cur-
ricula proves to be limiting, Wolfe said that the tradi-
tional format of W&L’s education will get students far in
life.

Wolfe had to leave Lexington to celebrate the 250th
Gala with the New York City Alumni Chapter; he was

scheduled to be honored as a Distinguished Alumni.
However, freshmen Tom Grove ran into Wolfe before he
left.

“Micah Tollman and I were sitting in the D-Hall when
[Micah] looked up over my head and says, ‘Is that Tom
Wolfe?’” Grove said. “I saw a white suit approching, and
I knew it had to be Wolfe in a suit like that.”

Wolf sat down to eat breakfast with his wife. Grove
and Tollman went over to Wolfe and talked with him about
his speech. While Grove didn’t have a Wolfe book with
him, he did have “A Sickness Unto Death,” by Soren
Kierkegaard.

“I asked him to lighten it up a bit for me,” Grove said.
Wolfe signed the book “Tom Wolfe is fabulous-Soren
Kierkegaard,” and handed it back to Grove, saying, “I’m
sure that’s what Kierkegaard would have said.”

Waiting for the ‘Man in Full’

the historical content of the video
hinted too much at alumni dona-
tions.

‘‘I’m worried now that ifI’m not a
Inillionaire in ten years that W&L
won’t care about me,” said one
sophomore.

In addition, many students ex-
pected to partake of the much-touted
1/6 mile long buffet table. Because of
the heavily discounted ticket prices
students were given, organizers did
not plan for students to eat dinner at
the event. Many students were disap-
pointed, however, as they were not
aware that they would virtually be ex-
cluded from the ornate dinner.

Aside from these grievances, the
vast majority of those who at-
tended enjoyed the evening im-
mensely. Junior Andy Stewart was

the party at all, but is very happy
that he took part in the event of
the year.

“I’m deﬁnitely glad that I went,”
Stewart said. “I guess this type of
event doesn’t happen often, but the
level of sophistication and class ex-
hibited was impressive.”

According to Director of Food
Services Gerald Darrell, that level of
sophistication and class came at a
dear cost to W&L.

“It was the largest social event in
the history of the county, it was un-
believable,” Darrell said. “Spectacu-
lar. Everything went smoothly.”

The total bill Darrell will be send-
ing to the Alumni Association, how-
ever, for the festivities under the
tent, as well as numerous other ca-
tering events this past weekend,
nears $130,000.

Maybe those alumni contribu-
tions will come in handy after all.

By Brendan Harrington
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee base-
ball team came within an arm’s
length of capturing their first ever
ODAC championship. A pitcher’s
arm length, to be exact.

On Sunday afternoon at
Lynchburg’s City Stadium, the Gen-
erals fell to the Bridgewater Eagles
13-2 in the championship game of
the ODAC baseball tournament. It
was the Generals’ fifth game in less
than 48 hours.

“We ran out of pitching, and we
were also just out of gas to play,”
W&L head coach Jeff Stickley said.
“We were a half second behind on
our swings. We were just worn
out.”

David Sigler, who was pitching

on just one day of rest, got
roughed up early, and a host of
inexperienced W&L pitchers
couldn’t put out the fire.
Bridgewater (25-17) scored seven
runs in the bottom of third, and
Eagles pitcher Gene Crawford
gave up only two runs in nine in-
nings ofwork. Crawford, who also
pitched two scoreless innings
earlier in the day, was named the
tournament’s Inost valuable
player.

It was only the second time in
team history that the Generals made
it to the championship game. The
last time was In 1984, the Generals
lost 4-1 to Lynchburg College in
the finals.

The odds were staked against
W&L (21-12) making it as far as
they did. Because the Generals lost

the first game ofthe double elimina-
tion tournament 3-2 to the Virginia
Wesleyan Marlins on Friday night,
the Generals needed to win four
straight games in order to win the
tournament.

“Once we lost the first game, it
was a stretch to think we could go as
far as we did,” Stickley said. “We
just kept playing and good things
kept happening.”

On Saturday, the Generals
downed Emory & Henry Wasps 9-6,
giving the Generals their first ODAC
tournament win since 1989. Senior
pitcher Bob Weston gave up three
runs in six innings to win his eighth
game ofthe year, tying a team record
for most wins by a pitcher in one sea-

son.
Sigler tied the same record,

OPINION

 

The Weekend is over. Following a year of build-up
and hype, some of us donned tuxes and dresses and
marched out to the ruins, some of us sat in frat houses
and watched Cable 2, and some ofus just blew the 250"‘
off and stayed home.

For seventy minutes last Saturday night, a large part
of the Washington and Lee community sat around and
did something fairly routine; got drunk and watched TV.
And what we saw was a show that was neither moving,
nor thrilling, nor in some instances particularly repre-
sentative. ‘

Minority students ﬂashed across the screen with
regularity, with much more regularity than they are seen
on campus. Once again, W&L tried to portray itself as a
place where students from all walks of life gather in the
noble pursuit of higher education. And the end result
sounded somewhat hollow.

The student population is currently made up of5.5
percent minority students, strikingly low in compari-
son to the real world. The fact remains that W&L con-
tinues to be a hard place for many minority students to
be, while at the same time attempting to deny the fact
that we are overwhelmingly white, Southern and
wealthy.

Minority students who choose to live with others of
similar interests or backgrounds in the Chavis or Inter-
national houses are treated to decrepit, homely build-
ings. Students who choose to live with others with simi-
lar interests in sports and greek letters are treated to
houses that the university has invested $13 million in.
What kind of message are we sending? It’s okay to talk
about polo, but not racial issues?

While it can certainly be argued that in building up-
dated minority housing, we encourage polarization
among the student population (Dean of Students David
Howison has stated that he will never support it for this
purpose). We encourage polarization everytime we hold
Rush. Anyone can see that a fair degree of polarization

exists already (ever seen the D-hall?) between minorities

and the majority, yet nothing is being done to correct
this. Instead, we simply deny minority organizations the
opportunity to meet in a decent place that might justify
the costs of tuition.

W&L is not culturally diverse. Yet viewbooks, cata-
logs, other publications circulated by the university and
now even the 250"‘ video would have us believe that we
are. Steps are being taken, but we are still not who we
pretend to be, and certainly not who we pretended to be
last Saturday night.

It’s time to make up our minds. Either embrace diver-
sity in a real sense and begin admitting freshmen classes
that reflect reality, or simply accept that who we are and
what we’ve been is what we will be, and then publicize
that instead of fantasyland. Stop making like a damn os-
trich, and get your head outta the sand.

It was somewhat amusing, or insulting depending on
your point of view, to watch a celebration of250 years
ofa heritage we don’t have.

Tﬁeing £1 Ittnft [Barnett philnfnphii: effag on
the nereffitg of learning to laugh at uurfeluiza

I never realized how much fun it could be to be widely
despised.

In three years of writing for this paper, I’d managed to
generate a sum total of one complaint letter — and that
from a townie (God forbid I should make ﬁsn of the locals,
it’s not like there’s anything funny about any of them).

But all that changed last month. Since then, I’ve gener-
ated no less than three angry

predators each day?

Lighten up, people. I’m a humorist, and since I don’t
take anythingl write seriously I don’t see why anybody
else should either. I’m only kidding. I think there are two
perspectives you can take on the problems of the world:
you can either learn to laugh at them or sit around crying
and whining and writing complaint letters. Pardon me for

taking the more psychologically

complaint letters and two per-
sonal attacks from other excel-
lent campus publications, one of
which mispelled the name of my
fraternity and one of which

 

healthy path.

So now, in this court of public opin-
ion, I’d like to be able to respond to
some of the charges levied against me:

mispelled my name. Suddenly
I’m under ﬁre from all sides like a
Kosovo villager (sorry, Ashley).

Now that I’m semi-controversial, I feel . . . well . . . happy.
For one thing, I know that at least somebody out there is
reading my nonsense. And knowing that I’m offending
people’s morals — well, that just gives me a warm and
ﬁizzy feeling inside, somewhat akin to swallowing a gerbil.

Oh no! Oh no! That last sentence might have offended
gerbils and gerbil-lovers (not Richard Gere) everywhere!
Censor! Censor, lest we offend! How dare we joke about
the serious crime of gerbil-eating? How dare I be insensi-
tive to the millions of wild gerbils eaten by their natural

lic: My family’s Catholic. I was

baptised and conﬁrmed into the Catholic church. I spent

thirteen years in Catholic schools. I think that gives me the

right to say whatever the hell I want about the Catholic
church.

On the charge that I’m a coward: A coward? Insensi-
tive ——sure. Mean-spirited — you bet. But a coward? That’s
an awfully bizarre accusation. I mean, how does one prove
his bravery in newsprint? I don’t think the heroic ideal of
any civilization has ever included sitting down and writ-

and they skimped on plumbing. Ru-
mor has it that our plumbing cannot
serve a full capacity because the
project coordinators never thought
Gaines would be ﬁlled to capacity.
C’mon. That’s really poor planning.
Many of the alumni here this past
weekend never though W&L would
admit women, but it still did. Always
plan for the “worse-case” scenario.

I often run past the location where
sorority housing is being built. I pray
that these buildings will have top-
notch plumbing. When I make my sec-
ond million and donateit to W&L (be-
cause I’m keeping the ﬁrst million for
myself), I will only give it on the stipu-
lation that they expel the demons
from Gaines plumbing, and then in-
stall more-than-capacity plumbing in
that building.

So those of you living in Gaines
next year, good luck. I wish you luck
and give you this advice: go to Wal-
Mart and get a mop and a really good
plunger. And if your toilet begins to
overflow, say your prayers. It’ll be a

On the charge that my editors need to start censoring‘
me: Censorship? Come on. You’re supposed to be in col-

Here’s a message for those ********s who think censor-

On the charge that there are some things you just don’t

society is ﬁnally pulling its collective stick out of its ass.

Beneﬁts of  
getting    
towedin Lex.

Is there a worse way to start out your Sunday
morning recovery than to walk out in the blinding ;
sun: and find your car not where it was the night be-’“
ifore? we all complain about being towed and cough-
ing up the 60 dollars to get our cars back from ,
_Lexington’s impound on the hill, but it could be worse.

o On a recent visit to a friend at UVA I awoke to that 2
all too familiar feeling that It had been towed. This
time, however, there was no security office to which?:
drag my
sorry self, '
no Kia ,.:;~
8 portage
to cart me
back to my , , I ’ “
ride, and a long list of wreckers in the Charlottesville
yellow pages that may or may not have been the
people kind enough to remove my car from that un-
authorized parking place. i o
 I got the car back (youlwere holding your breath,
weren’t you?), and it wasn’t a case of a country boy
from Rockbridge county scratching his noggin with
bewilderment in the big’ ole city of Charlottesville.
At W&L we know what we’re in for and probably
the name of the person that busted that attempt at
squeezing one by the powers that be on the first ﬂoor
of Graham-Lees. Most anywhere else we will never
see the forces that worked to ‘start our day off on a
terrible note.  , ,1 ‘
j ‘ Here we have an opportunity to plead our case
and try to make someone understand why our cars
stay parked in the corral or behind gym for days on
\ end. We know that someone will at least listen to our .
sad stories of impending deadlines and cold walks
L back from wherever it is that our cars should be
parked.

It is that element of familiarity in all aspects of _
W&L life that we tend to overlook. l’ll be towed again
once I’ve left Lexington and I’m sure that the hassle
will be much worse than any of us ever experience at
the hands of W&L security.

While no one enjoys it, at least we don’t have to
spend time tracking our cars down and wondering if
there will be someone to unlock an office door for us
at any number of wreckers all over town. There will
never be an upside to being towed, but the personal
touch with which our money is taken and we are in-
convenienced can’t be beat.

minutes to make their fame.

Students packed the Ruse for the
recording of “The Ear” last Tuesday
at 8 p.m.

1 The live CD compilation of the
event featuring some of W&L’s best
bands will be available by the end of
Spring term.

Speakeasy, Edwards and Harvey,

The CD is the first annual produc-
tion ofthe SFA. All proceeds will go
to Night Owl Music and the Ruse.

“We thought it would be wonder-
ful to have a record of how much tal-
ent we have on this campus for every-
one to remember,” event organizer
Susan Slim ’0l said.

The SFA will try to have the CD
out by April 19 in time to make it into a
time capsule. “It will show future gen-

thee a r

 

accomplish outside of academia,” Slim
said.

“It was a wonderful meeting of ar-
tistic minds,” senior Fowl Temptress
member Chad Reynolds said. “I was
very excited about the showing, not
only among the artists, but among the
fans.”

Due to necessary recording atmo-
sphere, the Ruse had to restrict the
number of audience members.

“I thought it was kind of bad that
people were turned away,” Barclay
Honeywood and Edwards and Harvey
frontman Chris Edwards ’99 said. “But
on the other
hand, it was great
that that many
people showed
up. We were re-
ally happy with
the crowd re-
spouse.”

The sounds
on the CD range
from the rock of
Speakeasy to the
bluegrass of
B a r c l a y
Honeywood to the jazz of Six on the
Brain.

“I was really pleased with eclectic
musical styles,” Edwards and Harvey
keyboardist Josh Harvey ’O0 said.

“I was skeptical about how the jazz
poetry combo would turned out, but it
sounded great,” Edwards said.

“Blending the spoken word with
the jazz gives the audience a great ex-
ample of how different artistic genres
can mix,” Slim said.

frolicking is deﬁnitely fun, the returning sun-
phine can bring hazards with it that you might
not foresee. After a long winter of bundling up
and staying inside, here’s a refresher on sum-
mer sun safety. You might want to keep this
handy; it could help you out this season.
Despite the fact that, in recent decades, the

about the dangerous ultraviolet (UV) rays
coming from the sun, the media have also con-
tinued to portray beauty and happiness as
things contingent upon bronze skin. As a re-
sult, millions of people (including students right
here at Washington and Lee) continue to lie
outside during the summer months, soaking
up rays and building for themselves a nice fu-
ture of premature aging, wrinkles and possibiy
 cancer. ’ 

Although this article will probably not
change anyone’s mind about sunbathing, it
might remind you to take a few precautions
when exposing yourself to the light.

Wear sunscreen. And a sun protection fac-
tor (spf) of three won’t cut it here. Research

shows that, for the best protection, one must

' se a minimum spf of l5,ipreferably in water-
proof, frequently-applied fomi. When correctly
used, a, sunscreen with spf 15.means that, for a
given light condition, it takes 15 times as long
to develop redness with the screen than with-
out. Harmful UV rays are blocked, and you re-
duce your chances of frequent trips to the der-
matologist when you get older. So reapply the
sunscreen every two hours, even on cloudy
days, and make sure to choose one with a high
spf and a wide spectrum of UV protection.

Bearthis in mind: tanning oils, acceleration

you have lots of free time during spring term V _
to go frolic in the summer atmosphere. While H

media have bombarded viewers with warnings _

creams and other products should be avoided.
These generally do nothing to protect your skin
from the UV rays. Check labels for the spfvalue,
and keep in mind that the more expensive prod-

nets aregnot necessarily better for you. H
Keep this in mind, too: some medications

have photosensitivity effects, which means
that, if you are on one of these drugs, you may
be more likely to burn and suffer skin damage
from the sun than you would be if you weren’t
taking the drugs. Some kinds of antihistamines,
oral contraceptives, tricyclic antidepressants,

. tetracycline antibiotics, diuretics and anti-in-

ﬂammatory drugs, just to name a few, can cause

‘p problems depending on the drug and the indi-

vidual. Even everyday products like deodor-
ant, soaps and perfumes can have photosensi-
tivity effects. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist
if you are confused about a product’s photo-
sensitivity.

To ﬁirther protect yourself, wear a wide-
brimmed hat and sunglasses when outside.
Also, avoid reﬂectingsurfaces, as they can toss
up to 85 percent of the damaging rays back up
at you, hitting you twice. Finally, if you start to
feel uncomfortably hot or if your shadow is
gone (because the sun is directly overhead),

r seek shade.iYou will still get the outdoor sum-

mer experience, but you won’t ﬁy.

If you dovget burned, stay out of the sun
until you heal. Wear protective clothing and
sunscreens, and use pain medications and
creams to ease your discomfort. /Above all, pre-
vent further burning; you’ve already done
enough damage. Remember: most of one’s life-
time sun exposure occurs before the age of 20,
so be careful.

The best advice for today’s tanners?_ Spring
for a spa trip and get a sunless tanning treat-
ment. You will get an even, streak-free tan, and
your skin won’t spend hours being abused by
the sun. If you must be bronze, this is the best
way to go. Otherwise, you’re on your own to
practice safe sun.

telling her she needs to see, on you. It
gives her a great time, and all the little
details let her know that, far away as
you may be, you are thinking just of her.
6. CALL HER on Sunday! For some
odd reason that only mothers can un-
derstand, just the sound of your voice
makes her happy. So go for it. Make
up for all those times you haven’t
called home, haven’t e—mailed, or have
spent an entire phone call or e-mail ar-
guing with her or trying to have your
own way. Be sweet. It’s only one day
a year, so you can do it— make it special.
7. Be creative and think of some-
thing entirely new and original that
only you COULD think of— all the
other stuff is great, but nothing makes
Mom as happy as knowing you were
thinking specifically ofher. So incor-
porate an inside joke you have with
her when planning your gift. Have fun
with it. Let it be trademark YOU ®.

Coming home again

W&L alumni compare past, present

By Elianna Marziani
FEATURESEDITOR '

Jazz blasting over the front lawn,
huge tents by the Ruins, extra ban-
ners all over the place: the evidence
of Washington and Lee’s Alumni
Weekend and the 250th Celebration
was quite apparent last weekend.

Though the campus looked and
felt different to current students, it
was even more different for the
alumni from across the decades who
reunited over the weekend. All were
reassured by the overwhelming feel-
ing that, while the appearance of the
campus and student body may have
changed since they were students,

the traditions and general feeling on-

campus had not changed at all.

Five-star General Keri Van
deWater ‘4 I enjoyed coming back to
W&L and seeing all the old and new,
especially new female, faces.

“[The presence of women] has
added ‘considerably to what W&L is
all about. They certainly have raised
the standard,” Van de Water said.

Warren Dean ‘54, also noticed
some siight changes in W&L from
his time here.

“Ijust came from the restroom, and
the girls were in the men’s room, and
the men were on the other side using
the urinals,” Dean said. “You ﬁgure it
out.”

Though shocked with the most
noticeable presence of women at
W&L, Dean felt reassured that the
atmosphere of the university was still
the same.

Ernie Foster ‘54 found the most
shocking difference at W&L the lack
of a dress code.

“Co-education, that’s fine,” he
said. The most memorable part of
W&L for him was his great profes-
sors, especially Gaines, Gilliam, and
Leybum. '

‘xx’ 3’ Don Sigmund ‘59 said, “The
- 0f[W&L] is What it is still: the

their love for the university. Some -

students, the honor system, the in- V
telligence, the gorgeous countryside.
The best is it hasn’t changed. It has
just gotten better.”

Lee Halford .‘69, was also happy
to seethat W&L had not changed
it’s basics.

“One of the greatest things about
W&L is the way that it has been able
to preserve its tradition for excel-
Ience.”

He enjoyed coming back and see-
ing W&L after all the years. “I’ve had
a wonderful stay —- I couldn’t imag-
ine a better weekend. I thought the
video was exceptional. The whole
250th celebration couldn’t have been
better.”

Ted Vaden ‘69, is a journalist in
Chapel Hill, North Carolina. J

“The most impressive thing to me
was seeing the presentation from the
Lenfest center. . . realizing not only
the people here at Liberty Hall, but
also at 55 other locations over the US. ’
were gathered . . . it’s a great sense of
connectedness. It’s just a powerful
feeling.”

Vaden also was reassured by a
sense of continuity at W&L.

“It really hasn’t changed very
much,” he said. “It’s the same sense
of camaraderie. We all know each
other even though we don’t know
each other.”

John McCants ‘84, noticed one
major change at W&L and obviously
wanted to comment on it.

“The quotes I could give you, you
couldn’t print,” he joked. Then, get-
ting more serious, he said, “They
voted on [co-education] my senior
year. I thought it was a good idea. It
think it has worked well for the
school.” He said that ‘the greatest
things about W&L is “the old
ﬁiends...still friends.. .great people.”

» All of the alumni expressed their
happiness tobe back at W&L and

things never change.

Lax locks out Keydets9-3 at Le

By Tod Williams

SPORTS WRITER

It has been the year of the sopho-
more for the men’s lacrosse team.
Saturday’s 9-3 victory over Virginia
Military Institute in the Lee-Jackson
Lacrosse Classic was no exception.

The top-ranked Generals (12-1, 5-0
ODAC) were led by sophomore
midﬁelders Bernie Norton and Matt
Dugan in the romp of Divison I VMI.

It was the 1 1th straight win for the
Generals this season, and the 11th
straight at Lee-Jackson.

W&L got off to an early start as
Dugan scored two of his four goals
on the day, only to be followed by a
goal from junior Andrew Jones to give
the Generals a 3-0 lead at the end of
the first quarter. Late in the second
quarter, Norton added his two goals
to the Generals’ cause, taking the team
to the locker room with a 5-1 lead.

The second half began with three
goals, two from Keydets and the third
again from Dugan. The Generals ﬁn-
ished out the third quarter up 6-3, but
goals from junior Colin Dougheity, jun-
ior Greg Meyers and Dugan in the
fourth ﬁnished the scoring at 9-3.

Each year, the Worrell-Fallon Award
is given to the most valuable player
from each team. This year, Norton’s
two goals and two assists and Keydet
Cregg Burns’ 11 saves in goal merited
them the honors. Sophomore goalie
Wes Hays came up just short of Burns
with 10 saves of his own.

Norton said that although the game
“isn’t an ODAC game, no one takes it
for granted. lt’s a really big game for the
city itself, and it’s such a big rivalry.”

Even though the Generals don’t
underestimate the Keydets, Norton
said getting excited about a game could
be a problem.

“We were a little ﬂat going out
there. We were nervous with such a
big crowd.”

An estimated 4,500 fans attended
this year’s contest.

Aﬂer Virginia Wesleyan lost 6-5
to Bridgewater in the winner’s
bracket championship, the Gener-
als took on the Marlins for a sec-
ond straight night. This time the
Generals carne away with a 13-6 vic-
tory, as W&L broke a 6-6 tie with
seven runs in the bottom of the
eighth inning.

Junior first baseman Russell
Wrenn went two for three with three
RBI. Junior Chris Stakem went the
distance for the Generals and
picked up the victory to go to 3-3
on the season. The victory, the
Generals’ 20th of the year, set a new
team record for most wins in a sea-
son, breaking the old record of 19
wins, which was set in 1912.

had no other option but to bring
Sigler in to pitch, even though he was
coming off only one day of rest. Sigler
pitched out of the jam to record the
save, and the Generals hung on to
winl0-9, forcing a second game that
would decide the championship.

“I wanted to save David [Sigler] until
the second game and not pitch him at
all in the ﬁrst game,” Stickley said. “But
we had to use the best we had.”

Sigler had to sit around for over half 1

an hour before he could take the
mound in the second game. He gave
up three runs in the first inning, giv-
ing Bridgewater a 3-0 lead that they
would never relinquish.

“They were scared after we beat
them the first game,” Stickley said. “But
once they got to David, it was over.”

The Generals had five players 1

named to the all-tournament team:
Wrenn, Stakem, senior second
baseman Patrick Hall, senior catcher
E.J. Murphy, and junior left fielder
Schuyler Marshall.

Hall, Murphy, Weston, and the rest
of the Generals senior class saw their
careers come to a close on Sunday.

Hall ends his career holding the <

records for most career hits, runs
scored. and RBI at W&L, while
Weston holds the record for most ca-
reer wins with 23. Murphy had an out-
standing tournament, going eight for
18 with 4 RBIs.

“The key to the whole thing was
the seniors ~ they just made us a

tougher team,” Stickley said. “Open- -*1

for most wins in a season, having all
those guys make the all-toumament
