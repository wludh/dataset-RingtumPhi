Squeeze, Skins to start off

Homecoming

By Jason Kelley
Editor

 

 

For the second year in a row, Washington
and Lee’s Student Activities Board has been
able to book a nationally-known band for
homecoming.

This year, the English band Squeeze will
headline the Friday night concert at the Pav-
ilion. Last year, The Smithereens played for
homecoming.

‘Tt was really a coup to get Squeeze to
play here,’’ Dabney Collier, who is in charge
of booking bands for the SAB. ‘‘It’s really dif-
ficult to get nationally known bands to play at
small colleges.”’

Collier said
Squeeze will be
playing tonight in
Washington D.C.
where tickets will
be $24. Tomor-
row at W&L, the
SAB willonly be
charging $8.

Tomorrow’s
concert will be
only the second
time Squeeze has
played with its
new opening
band, The Candy Skins. According to Collier,
the members of the original opening band lost
their U.S. visas and had to return to Great
Britain.

Formed in South East London in 1974,
Squeeze was originally named U.K. Squeeze to
distinguish it from the disbanded American
Squeeze. The band broke up in 1982, but three
years later three of the original five members
of the band, Chris Difford, Gilson Lavis and

   

The Candy Skins

 

 

Weekend

Glenn Tilbrook, were joined by Keith Wil-
kinson to form the present Squeeze.

The band’s first hit ‘‘Take Me I’m
Yours,’’ came off their second album in 1978.
The cut was a top 20 hit in the U.K. that year.

Other early hits from the band include
‘*Up the Junction,” ‘‘Cool for Cats.’ Th
1981 they opened a series of concerts for Elvis
Costello’s U.S. tour. He in tum produced the
group’s fourth album, East Side Story, which
included their hits ‘‘Pulling Mussels from a
Shell’’ and ‘‘Tempted’’.

Later hits from the band include ‘‘La-
belled with Love,”’ ‘‘853-5937,’’ ‘‘Hourglass”’
and ‘‘Satisfied’’.

A compilation of their hits, Singles —
45’s and Under
reached number 3
on the English
charts in 1983.

Friday’s
opening _ band,
The Candy Skins,
released _ their
debut album,
Space I'm In, this
year in the U.K.
and the U.S.

Also from
Great Britain, the
band describes its
sound as ‘‘so-
mewhere between the lyricism of the Sixties
and the aggression of punk.”’

The Candy Skins songs display influences
ranging from Bob Dylan to the Sex Pistols to
the Beatles and the Byrds.

After W&L, Squeeze and The Candy
Skins will continue their U.S. tour in Philadel-
phia, Oswego, N.Y., Baltimore, New York
City, and 17 other cities. The tour will con-
clude in mid-November in Dallas.

Old football
rivalry up
for renewal

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

 

For the the first time in almost fifteen
years, Washington and Lee will carry its fierce
classroom rivalry with North Carolina’s David-
son College to the football field.

The two teams will collide Saturday at 2
p.m. on Wilson Field for the annual Homecom-
ing game.

While both colleges are strong academic
institutions which often compete for the same
students, this weekend's battle will call for the
clash of bodies and football pads, rather than
minds.

‘‘We put Davidson on the football sched-
ule because of the similarities between the
schools,’’ said W&L Athletic Director Mike
Walsh.

“TI know that both schools’ admission’s
offices cross-recruit,’’ he said, adding that the
two school’s traditionally attract top notch
students who are also quality athletes.

In a recent US News & World Reports
poll, Davidson and W&L were ranked together
in several categories. Davidson was ranked 21st
and W&L 22nd among the nation’s top liberal
arts colleges. W&L was ranked Ist and David-
son 2nd in the ‘‘Best Buy’’ category.

“T think you can underscore the sim-
ilarities of the schools with the US News &
World Report article,’ said Walsh. ‘‘We are
two schools with like-minded academic inter-
ests. The main difference though, is that while
we are strictly Division III, Davidson is
Division I with the exception of football.”’

Although students and alumni alike
participate in Washington and Lee’s
annual Homecoming activities, few are
aware of the rich history surrounding the
long-standing tradition.

Since its inception, Homecoming
has been observed and interpreted in
many different ways. This supplement is
dedicated to exploring several past and
present Homecoming activities that have
spurred its continuance.

For such spirit with which some
students view Homecoming also may
have inspired the creation many years
ago of a student publication named after
the following football song:

Each other's back ,boys, Has got a knack, boys,

For making gains, sir, Round the end.

And it's a sin, sir, For Oberlin a WerL player], sir,
To buck the V.M.I. boys’ line so awful hard.

Then join the yell, boys, And yell like hell, boys,
Sure enough.

To We&L U., boys, And football, too, boys,

Let's give a rousing, rumbling, roaring, football yell.
Ring-tum phi, stickeri bum!

‘We are the stuff from old Lexington’’

From staff reports

 

1925. The first Homecoming.
On Saturday, November 7th,
1925, thousands of people filled
Wilson Field, bleachers erected on
both sides and both ends of the
field, and all standing space to
watch the Generals under a steady
drizzling rain beat UVa 12-0. Alt-
hough the Homecoming crowd no
longer fills the stands and tra-
ditions changed, W&L still holds
the spirit of that first
homecoming.

The Alumni Magazine for
October 1925 announced the
“First Official Annual Home-
coming Day.’’ Tickets were $2
and the seats were reserved. Alu-
mni were invited to attend a
meeting of the Alumni Associa-
tion, Inc. where they would be
addressed by G.H. Denny, a for-
mer W&L president who had
gone on to become president of
the University of Alabama (which
was sharply criticized elsewhere
in the same issue of the magazine
for stealing the W&L Swing and
calling it the Alabama Swing).
Alumni were also invited to at-
tend classes that morning. ‘‘That
morning’ was Saturday. Things
have changed.

Accommodations were made
for 10,000 people. Fraternity
house managers’ names were
listed in the Alumni Magazine so
alumni could contact them if they
wanted to stay in their fraternity
houses. The railroads offered
special rates from all over the
state to Lexington. Game tickets
were on sale in Roanoke, Lynch-
burg and Staunton.

The night before the game a
pep rally was held and a thousand
people attended. There were
cheers, speeches and a bonfire.

Local merchants were asked to
keep their stores closed during the
afternoon so that everyone in
town could attend the game. It
must have seemed like everyone
in the state was there to watch
the Generals beat UVa. A dance
was held on Saturday night. The
First Official Annual Homecoming
Day was such a success that they
decided to keep doing it.

Many of the traditions which
grew up over the years are now
gone: fraternity decorations, fresh-
man parades, the 13 Club, pep
rallies, the ‘‘Opening Dance.”’

On Friday night, the night
before the big game, the fresh-
men, wearing pajamas, and other
students would gather in the gym
for a pep rally. W&L’s cheer-
leaders would lead the students in
cheers and speeches would be
given by the coaches and players.
In 1955, RJ. Reynolds Tobacco
Company gave 1,000 megaphones
to the students for the pep rally.

The parade must have been a
sight. In 1955 the Phi ran a pic-
ture of the parade. In the picture
was group of students wearing
pajamas, one of them bearing a
placard reading, ‘‘Shove It Up. a
Turkey--Gobble, Gobble.’’

13 days before Homecoming,
the 13 Club would begin its in-
itiation period for 13 new pledges
from 13 different fraternities who
each had paid an initiation fee of
$13.13, At some point during
these 13 days the statue of Cyrus
McCormick, the one standing
guard on front campus, the one
most visitors think is Lee, was
tarred and feathered, and the base
covered with number 13s.

What a fine time it must have
been.

The dates of Homecoming
weekend skipped around through
the years. It was possible for

COURT

HOUSE

 

Homecoming to fall anywhere
between mid october and late
november before settling down to
its present position of early oc-
tober. Homecoming has occured
every year since 1925, except for
1954 when the festivities were
cancelled. Every so often Home-
coming and Openings were com-
bined, like in 1962 and ’65.
Saturday of Homecoming
would usually begin with a foot-
ball game, just as it does now,
but without the liquid pleasure of
recent years. In the 1955 Home-
coming issue of the Phi the EC
stated that its policy against
drinking in public would be strict-
ly enforced at that year’s game.

Saturday service
set for Lee Chapel

 

By Joyce Bautista
Staff Reporter

 

“‘In essential respects his spirit
beautifully lives before and with
the boys. The ultimate monument
to him is the University which has
now linked his name with that of
Washington in its title. There was
a university which was dead and
he made it alive. It is alive today
largely in the mold he formed for
it; it breathes the inspiration he
brought.”’

-Dr. Francis Pendelton Gaines,
former Washington and Lee Presi-
dent

This Saturday marks the 121st
aniversary of the death of General
Robert E. Lee, president of, then
Washington College, from 1865 to
1870. Capt. Robert C. Peniston,
director of Lee Chapel, will be
the featured speaker for the un-
viersity’s annual memorial service,
sponsored by the W&L Alumni
Association and two Civil War
reenactment groups, honoring Lee.

“I accepted the offer to speak

at the memorial service with
pleasure,’’ Peniston said. “‘It’s a
great honor for a non-alumnus to
be asked to do this.’’

Peniston’s speech will mark
the first time he has delivered
featured remarks at W&L,
although he has served as direc-
tor of Lee Chapel for more than
a decade.

According to Peniston, his
speech is based on the West Point
motto ‘‘Duty, Honor, Country.”’
“Lee grew up under this motto,’’
said Peniston, a ’46 alumnus of
the United States Naval Academy
in Annapolis, Md. ‘‘I think the
whole country should take heed
GE At”

Peniston, a retired Navy cap-
tain after 30 years, says since
becoming director of Lee Chapel
his admiration for the Lee family
has grown. ‘‘He saved the place,’’
Peniston said, ‘tand set a standard
that presidents have been trying to
match ever since.”’

Peniston, an avid teller of
tales, recalls a Lee remark he
stumbled across in his reading:

“‘When [Lee] asked what rules
were in effect at then Washington
College, the general replied, ‘We
have no rules here except that
every student be a gentleman.”

Peniston says he will stress in
his speech Lee’s contribution of
an Honor Code similar to that of
his Alma Mater, West Point.
‘Very simply, this is his legacy
to the school he rescued from the
ash heap of war.”’

He also cited tangible signs of
Lee’s influence on the college,
such as the chapel, the Commerce
school and the school of Jour-
nalism, which were established
to provide students with choice,

which he said was very important
to Lee.

And Peniston should know the
makings of a a great man, for he
has been in the presence of of
formidable gentlemen. Because of
his profession and rank, he has
met numerous presidents, such as
Truman, and international figures,
such as Winston Churchill.

His career at Washington and
Lee began 15 years ago when he
was asked to be the new director
of Lee Chapel. His ties to the
university run even deeper. His
son graduated from W&L in ‘75
and his son-in-law in ‘76.

According to Peniston, the

memorial service tradition began
five years ago when he was asked
if it could be held in Lee Chapel.

As part of the ceremony,
Peniston personally rings the
chapel’s bells 19 times, the e-
quivalent of a 19 gun salute.
“That is how many he would
have been entitled to as the com-
mander-in-chief of the
Confederate forces,’’ Peniston
said.

The service will begin Satur-
day at 9:30 a.m, the time of
Lee’s death in 1870. At that
time, the Liberty Hall Volunteers,

The Ring-tum Phi Homecoming Supplement, October 10, 1991

It takes more than beauty to be W&L's queen

 

By Smith Carlson
Staff Reporter

 

‘‘We're looking for someone
with a strong sense of values;
someone who is intelligent. We’re
looking for the girl who best
represents Washington and Lee,”’
explained Robert de Maria, chair-
man of this year’s Homecoming
Queen Selection Committee.

“It is very difficult,’’ he said.
‘‘Last year any of them would
have been a great representative.’’

The judges, who are faculty
members selected by the Alumni
Relations staff and the student
alumni-relations group Kathekon,
include: de Maria, University
Librarian Barbara Brown, Cam-
paign Events Coordinator Chris-
tine Davis, former Director of
Security Charles Murray and
Chemistry Prof. Michael Pleva.

They have the responsibility of
interviewing candidates and deter-
mining which nominee is best
suited for the title. They will
judge the contestants on poise,
appearance, and activities.

The process begins with the
announcement of candidates from
various campus organizations. To
be eligible, an organization must
be officially recognized by the
university.

Mostly fraternities and
sororities submit nominees, how-
ever representatives from the
Minority Students Association, the
Independent Students Union, the
International Club and the W&L
Law School’s Student Bar As-
sociation, 24 in all, have been
announced.

In choosing a candidate, many
groups take far more into con-
sideration than simply appearance.

Sigma Chi fraternity took
several factors into account.
‘She helped us out a lot last
year,”’ said sophomore Trevor
Norris of the group’s nominee.
‘She hangs out at the house and
is a good friend.”’

An organization’s representa-
tive does not necessarily have to
attend W&L either. The only
current requirement for nominees
is that they attend a college or
university, although in past years
several wives of W&L students
have been elected queen. Some
fraternities have even dolled up
their members and presented them
in drag.

didate this year is a student at

Mary Baldwin. ‘‘We all know her
and we get along really well,’’
said an SAE member. ‘‘It was a
unanimous vote.’’

The International Club, which
elected a new vice-president and
a Homecoming representative at
the same meeting, went so far as
to make up ballots for their
nominations.

Contest coordinators Rob Mish
and recent graduate Chris Baradel
described the type of female they
think organizations tend to chose
as their nominee.

‘*Fraternities want a girl who
comes to the house, who is
known by the fraternity, and who
is well-liked,’’ said Baradel, him-
self a graduated Pi Kappa Alpha
member.

Others however, said they
consider other criteria. One frater-
nity member said his house’s
nominee was friends with only a
few of its members and probably
had not set foot in the house, but
the group chose her because ‘‘We
wanted someone who could win,”’
he said candidly.

On Friday, the proffered can-
didates will assemble for inter-
views with the judges. Each inter-
view lasts approximately seven
minutes and consists of three pre-
agreed upon questions.

The questions, explained de
Maria, are thought provoking.
“It’s important that we get to
know her,’’ he said. ‘‘And seven
minutes is not long to do that
fart

 

Following the interviews, the
judges will compare notes and the
process of elimination begins.
After careful consideration, the
judges come up with two finalists
an the queen.

According to Associate Alumni
Relations Director Robert Mish,
no duties go along with the title,
and that winners typically return
the crown to a university official
after half-time.

The court will officially be
presented during half-time at the
Homecoming game on Saturday.

Student Body President Giles
Perkins will introduce the court,
and amidst much anticipation,
announce the name of W&L’s
Queen for a day.

The Ring-tum Phi Homecoming Supplement, October 10, 1991

W&L can’t evade
football spirit

By Jacob Kimball
Staff Reporter

 

For well over a century, foot-
ball has been a part of the
Washington and Lee tradition. At
times the small campus has even
received national attention for its
exploits on the gridiron, and was
considered a force on the national
college football scene. During this
time span the game of football
changed drastically, as did its role
on this campus.

The history of W&L football
goes back to the year 1873, as the
first contest occurred only eight
years after the inception of the
now well-entrenched honor code.
The program consisted of a series
of games with the nearby Virginia
Military Institute and a few other
schools.

The schedule gradually expand-
ed to include a broader set of
opponents, while games with VMI
developed into battles for bragg-
ing rights.

In the early 20th century, W&L
started producing some sensa-
tional team and individual perfor-
mances. The revered Cy Young,

who earned sixteen varsity letters
along the way, led the first of the
college’s truly dominating teams.
The teams of 1912 to 1915 relied
heavily on Young’s talent as they
amassed a total of 32 wins against
only 3 losses and one tie.

In 1954 two players were
caught turning in tests with exact-
ly the same responses. The whole
situation was turned over to the
Executive Committee, and when
the dust had settled, 14 football
players and one cheerleader, had
withdrawn from the school due to
incriminating evidence.

This cheating scandal, coupled
with the debt that had accumu-
lated due to athletic scholarships,
forced the Board of Trustees into
making a decision concerning the
future of football at W&L.

The Trustees decided to de-
emphasize the program amid fer-
vent protests from some alumni.
This decision was based on the
conclusion that the university
could no longer continue to strike
a balance between _ strong
academics and big-time football.

After this decision the program
started from scratch, because most

of the remaining scholarship play-

Trustees to terminate athietic scholarships.

ers left, and expected freshman
recruits went elsewhere. Things did
not start to look up until Lee Mc-
Laughlin was hired as head coach.

In a tribute to McLaughlin’s
coaching ability and enthusiastic
play of his players, the Generals
turned in back-to-back immaculate
seasons.

The 1961 team received recog-

nition as the best small team in the
nation after its undefeated season.
This designation was given by the
Washington Touchdown Club, and
again the spirit of college football
gripped the campus.

The Trustees stuck to their
policy of no more athletic
scholarships with conviction, while
still retaining its high academic

only at

standards for those on or off the
playing field.

According to Frank Parsons,
long-time university publicist, the
men who composed the teams of
this new era were quality individu-
als with a strong sense of camara-
derie, that would be upheld to the
present.

Cheerleaders once led rallys, game cheers

 

By Alisha Johnson
Staff Reporter

 

They just don’t make
Homecoming like they used to.

Male cheerleaders no longer
lead spirited students in the
‘Washington and Lee Swing’’ at
pep rallies, and parades featuring
pajama-clad freshmen carrying
traditional homecoming torches no
longer march through downtown
Lexington.

Many of the activities which

enhanced the homecoming
celebration have fallen by the
wayside.

According to a former W&L
head cheerleader, Leigh Allen,
60, the most important activities
during homecoming week were

—VARNER & POLE

the fraternity decorations competi-
tion and the pep rallies.

‘The fraternities used to have
decorations for their houses, and
an award would be given for the
best decorations made,’’ Allen
said. ‘‘We also always had a pep
rally where the cheerleaders
would lead the students in cheers.
None of our cheers were really
unique to the school except, of
course, the good ole ‘W&L
Swing’ which all the students
liked.”’

Allen said that tryouts and
practices for the cheerleading
squad were not very intense, but
entertaining nevertheless.

‘There were about eight or
nine of us on the team,’’ said
Allen, who was cheerleader for
three years. ‘‘Different frater-

nities encouraged people to try-
out, and the captain of the squad
picked who he thought was best.
There was really no intense com-
petition. We just liked to have a
lot of fun. The cheerleaders
didn’t really take it too serious-
ly.”

At one time W&L had a six
female cheerleaders, who were
recruited from nearby Southern
Seminary.

Allen added that a cheerlead-
ing squad would help current
students get back into the spirit of
homecoming.

“I think it would be a good
idea for W&L to have cheerlead-
ing again,’’ Allen said. ‘‘Having
women on campus now would
make the team even better...at
least they would be much cuter to

watch. With a little leadership, it
[cheerleading] would be an addi-
tional feature at the ball game.’’

Assistant Director of Alumni
Programs Rob Mish agreed that
steps should be taken to stir up
homecoming spirit.

‘I don’t remember there being
anything really special about
Homecoming while I was here,”’
said Mish, who graduated from
W&L in 1976.

According to Mish, many of
the homecoming activities
embraced by W&L’s student body
through the 50s and ’60s got
pushed aside by the apprehension
of the Vietnam War.

“It seems that the parades
stopped in the early ’70s, around

Fa LaLa
‘W&L Swing’ is still popular

 

By Nicole Keeler
Staff Reporter

Though Washington and Lee
has long since deemphasized its
collegiate athletics department, the
‘‘Washington and Lee Swing’’
has remained for 80 years the
most popular and most widely
imitated fight song in collegiate
history.

According to a Washington
and Lee Alumni magazine article
written by Robert B. James Jr.
the ‘‘W&L Swing’’ has had ‘‘had
a history as stormy as it is fas-
cinating.”’

According to James, the
melody was originally composed
in 1905 by Mark Sheafe, a W&L
student from South Dakota.
Though he graduated the next
year the tune was kept alive by
members of the  university’s

Guitar Club with whom it re-
mained a favorite.

However, the song remained
without lyrics until 1909 when
two other W&L students, Thorn-
ton W. Allen and Clarence T.
Robbins heard the music and
composed its words, setting the
Swing apart as the first victory
song ever composed for a univer-
sity by its students.

The Swing was an immediate
success and was quickly adopted
by other universities. Many
adapted the lyrics with little
regard for copyright laws.

James related how both Tulane
and Alabama took the Swing as
their air. When they faced each
other in 1931, the clash caused a
great deal of confusion and anger,
he said.

The ‘‘W&L Swing” has also
been used as the theme song for

 

Cheerleaders on the 1960 squad practice for the next big game

John Davis, Democratic candidate
for President, and a W&L grad-
uate in 1892.

A copy of it was even carried
into space on the Shuttle
Columbia by U.S. astronaut
and W&L graduate G. David Low
a few years ago. Low and other
Columbia . crew members were
later roused by strains of the
Swing from NASA headquarters.

In 1958, Louis ‘Satchmo’
Armstrong played at a W&L
Homecoming ‘‘and ended on a
screaming note with ‘Washington
and Lee Swing’,”’ according to
one publication.

__ Al this in addition to spurr-
ing on countless college and high
school athletic teams to victory.

James said that despite its age,
the ‘‘W&L Swing’ is, ‘‘ the
most popular football song ever
written,””

the time that Fancy Dress went
out,’’ he said. ‘‘When students
found out they had the Vietnam
War to deal with, the idea of
Homecoming spirit wasn’t a
priority. Fancy Dress started up
again in 1974, but a lot of the
homecoming activities never came
back.’’

Mish expressed interest in
seeing the ‘‘Torchless Torchlight
Parade’’ return to Washington and
Lee. According to a Ring-Tum
Phi article dated Nov. 6, 1959,
the fiery parade through town
followed a pep rally each year to
open the festivities for W&L’s
homecoming weekend.

“Freshmen will wear pajamas
to the pep rally and for the
parade which follows,’’ the article
stated. ‘‘Leading the parade will
be...members from the ROTC and
University band. Following the
band will be cars carrying the
various fraternities’ Homecoming
queen nominees, and then the
pajama-clad frosh.”’

On behalf of the univeristy,
Mish said ‘‘The Alumni Office is
very aware that [Homecoming
activities] have gone by the
wayside. For this reason we have
given Kathekon’ more
responsibility with Homecoming
this year. In talking to the group,

the students seem _ very
interested.’
Kathekon President Laura

Pilachowski said she would like
to see the organization bring spirit
back into Homecoming. For ex-
ample, she said Kathekon is
trying to get the ‘‘W&L Swing’
printed on cups which will be
passed out at the football game.

Pilachowski said she would
like to see such activities as
fraternity decorations and parades
begin again, as well.

a group of W&L students and
employees interested in Civil War
reenactment, will march from
Washington Hall on the W&L
campus to Lee Chapel for the
memorial service, according to a
campus press release.

The invocation and benediction
will be delivered by Louis W.
Hodges, professor of religion at
W&L.

Joan Brooks of the Virgina
chapter of the United Daughters
of the Confederacy will also
speak, along with W&L
sophomore Christian Keller who
will read from Douglas Southall
Freeman’s R.E. Lee , the passage
in which the general’s last words
are spoken.

The service will end with the
music selections by Southern
Comfort and JubiLee, and will
include General Lee’s favorite
hymn, ‘*How Firm a
Foundation.’

On Saturday night a dance,
would be held in a lavishly dec-
orated Doremus Gymnasium.
Beginning in 1957 with the first
Homecoming Queen, the Queen
would be crowned at the dance.
Until last year, Dr. Shillington
had kissed all of the Queens with
very few interuptions.

The last mention in the Phi of
a house winning a decorations
award was Lambda Chi in 1969,
and a writer in that same issue
wrote, ‘‘It seems that for the most
part, an alumnus returning to
campus is a lonely experience.’’
By 1970, the only mention
made in the Phi of Homecoming
was that it existed and there
would be a concert Friday night
and the game Saturday followed
by a grain party in Red Square
sponsored by the sophmore class.

To the dear old college

 

In 1971 Homecoming was noth-
ing but a small picture in the Phi,

in the lower left hand comer of
the front page, of Shillington
kissing the Queen.

But W&L was never a big
school. The teeming thousands
that once filled Wilson Field are
back to a scale more in line with
a small college. But some things
here will never change.

On that first Homecoming
Day, back in 1925, former W&L
President G.H.Denny praised
W&L with words that still hold
true. ‘Take away from many a
college its endowment and what
is left?”” asked Denny, ‘‘But strip
the Washington and Lee Campus
of every building and every dol-
lar, and there are left some things
more precious than silver and
gold.’ That hasn’t changed.

Come You Back to Washington and Lee

By the banks of Old North River,
Winding lazy ‘round the hill,

campus

My thoughts are turning still;
For the college bells are calling,

And I know they say to me,
Come you back you old Alumnus,

Back to Washington and Lee.
Ship me back to Old Virginia

Where the summer skies are blue;
‘Where the gods walk on the hill-tops

In the sunsets rosy hue;
For I've heard their voices calling,

And its there that I would be,
In the shadow of the mountains-

Back at Washington and Lee.

 

 

Davidson and W&L haven't
met on the football field since
1978, during Head Coach Gary
Fallon’s first season at W&L.
Davidson, then Division I, won
easily 34-7. But in the two col-
lege’s football history, a Davidson
win has been the exception rather
than the rule.

Both schools were members of
the Southern Conference in the
1940s and early 1950s and did
battle on the gridiron for 13
straight years. W&L dominated
the series, winning 11, losing one
and tying one. In overall games,
W&L holds a 13-8-1 edge,
Davidson has won in the college’s
last four football games since
W&L dropped athletic scholar-
ships in 1954.

“The rivalry has seen good
athletic competition in the past,
and we look forward to continu-
ing the tradition,’ Walsh said.

Walsh announced that Satur-
day’s football game will be the
first in a string of renewed com-
petitions with Davidson. Because
Davidson is Division I in other
sports, he said it will be difficult

for W&L to maintain a rivalry
with the Wildcats.

“It’s a decent rivalry,’’ said
Walsh. ‘‘They are a school that
we want to play, and enjoy play-
ing against, but that’s mostly in
individual sports. They have a
little bit of an upper hand because
they are Division I.”’

Walsh said he hopes that the
athletic competition will again
grow to the level it had reached
before the teams stopped playing
each other.

Both teams will enter Satur-
day’s game with _ struggling
records. Davidson is 1-3 while
W&L is 0-4. Davidson's strength
lies in its running game, led by
freshman fullback Bruce Bannister
and quarterback Richard
Howell. Bannister has run for 287
yards on just 36 carries, and
Davidson averages 192 yards
rushing per game.

W&L has struggled offensive-
ly, averaging just 98 yards per
game. Senior Jeff Kreis leads the
team with seven catches, and
senior George Sakin and junior
Wade Robinett each have six.
