Wilson plans
new bul

Expansion of Reeves Center
could begin in December

 

By Leigh Allen
Staff Reporter

 

Construction of a new front-cam-
pus building to house a collection of
historic porcelains could begin as
early as December.

The gallery is to be built west of
the Reeves Center and north of Tuck-
er Hall. It is to house a donated
collection of antique Chinese furni-
ture, jade pieces and porcelain worth
at least $6 million to $10 million,
said President John Wilson.

Those items and funding for the
building are to be donated by Mrs.
William Watson, said Wilson. Mrs.
Watson and her late husband, Wil-
liam Watson ’29, are longtime bene-
factors of Washington and Lee.

Plans for the gallery are being
handled by Wilson personally, with
little input from W&L’s capital plan-
ning director and faculty.

University spokesman Brian Shaw
said the lack of faculty involvement
in plans for the proposed gallery has
upset some professors. And some
students also are opposed to the idea
of a new addition to the Hill.

“T don’t know why they need
another building to house a ceramics
exhibit,’ said junior Erika Lee.
“‘With all the money that was spent
on the Lenfest Center, I thought they
could have put it over there. That’s

the arts center.’’

But university officials said dona-
tions will cover the cost of construc-
tion and maintenance. And Wilson
said there’s nothing unusual about the
way plans for the building are being
handled.

‘*‘Mrs. Watson is a dear friend of
the university,’’ Wilson said. ‘‘Be-
cause of the outstanding relationship
that exists between Jim Whitehead,
myself and Mrs. Watson, I thought
that we could handle this project here
rather than through Capital Plann-
ing.”’

Whitehead, director of the Reeves
Center, which houses W&L’s current
porcelain collection, said the center
will remain the same. The new build-
ing will not be directly attached, said
Whitehead.

The architect’s model on display at
the Reeves Center shows a brick wall
separating the center from the new
gallery.

‘‘The wall is a little formidable,
and that plan will be revised,” said
Wilson. ‘‘The wall will be reduced.’’

Twenty students face charges
of underage possession of alcohol
after Lexington police and under-
cover Alcohol and Beverage Con-
trol officers patrolled W&L frate-
mity parties last weekend.

According to police records,
officers charged 16 W&L stu-
dents and four women’s college
students between 10 p.m. Satur-
day and 2 a.m. Sunday.

Lexington Police Chief B. M.
Beard said most of the students
were stopped while the officers
were on a routine patrol around
the corner of Henry and Jefferson
streets, near Red Square.

‘(The officers} sighted one
subject for possession of alcohol
under age, and then it was a
chain reaction,’’ Beard said.

W&L students wij} have to change the way they
party if they don’t want to be arrested or fined for
violating state drinking laws.

Generally ABC agents and police officers will only
ticket students who have alcohol outside fraternity
houses or on the street, ABC Special Agent Roger D.
Stevens said. Even students who are 21 may be
charged with drinking in public.

“You know the best way to stop all the viola-
tions? ’’ Stevens said. ‘‘Just stay in the [fraternity]
houses.

“We don’t go in without probable cause. If the
students stay in the houses, we have no need to go
in,’’

However, ABC agents are not prevented from
entering a party if they have reason to believe illegal
activity is taking place inside. Stevens said ABC agents
may legally enter a fraternity party if they either have
a search warrant or have seen a violation occur.

‘‘Remember, I don’t need a search warrant all the
time, and neither do the local police,’’ Stevens said.

ABC agents also may enter a fraternity party if

they are invited in, Stevens said. For example, if an
undercover ABC agent goes to a party, and a frater-
nity member lets him in, the agent may enter and issue
tickets for drinking violations.

Undercover agents are not required to be honest
about their identities, even if they are asked, Stevens
said. If a fraternity has a guest list, then the agents
shouldn’t be allowed inside the party, even if they lie
about who they are.

‘*We want to give the fraternities the opportunity to
prove that their party is closed,’’ Stevens said.

Most of the students ticketed last weekend were
caught walking down the street with beer bottles or
cans. However, Stevens said agents may not stop a
student for carrying a cup.

“*But if I see a straw-colored liquid with a foamy
head in the cup, then I may have probable cause [to
stop the student],’’ Stevens said. -

Stevens said the best way for fraternities to avoid
problems with ABC agents and police is to follow the
Interfraternity Council guidelines: Keep all alcohol
inside, and have a guest list for each party.

Stevens said these guidelines were agreed upon by
ABC agents, Lexington police and the IFC.

‘‘We’re not requiring the fraternities to do anything
they haven’t been told to do before,’’ Stevens said.

 

 

SAC to study plan
for black fraternity

 

By Rick Peltz
Editor

 

Historically black fraternal or-
ganizations colonizing at W&L will
be a topic at the next Student Affairs
Committee meeting.

Dean of Students David Howison
said that SAC, in response to a re-
quest from students, will study the
feasibility of Alpha Phi Alpha frater-
nity and Delta Sigma Theta sorority
joining the Washington and Lee com-
munity.

‘The goals of historically black
fraternities and sororities are com-
patible with the aims and objectives
of Washington and Lee,’’ Howison
said in a statement of his personal
opinion,

Two students concerned with the
effort to bring a black fraternity to
W&L declined to comment until their
plans are more secure,

Howison said SAC ‘‘approved in
principle the establishment of an
historically black fraternity and/or
sorority’? on May 31, but the com-
mittee must examine several issues to
determine if a new group could in
fact colonize here.

‘*There’s no way I would support
the creation of these fraternities or
sororities outside of our present sys-
tem,’’ Howison said.

At other schools, historically black
fraternities frequently solicit new
members outside the regular rush.

Freshmen start the three-day
Open House phase of Rush on
Monday by shaking hands with
fraternity members.

 

Once agaim, about 90 percent of
the male freshmen signed up for
Fraternity Rush, Interfraternity Coun-
cil Vice-President Rob Rambo said.

That's welcome news for the
fraternities’ Rush chairmen.

“Our numbers are pretty strong,
about the same as last year,’’ Phi
Kappa Sigma Rush Chairman Dave
Lefkowitz said.

The number of participants in
Rush this year rose from last year’s
total, because there are 40 more men
in the freshmen class, Associate Dean

C, ‘Buddy’’ Atkins said.

Many freshmen said they were
enjoying Rush so far.

accord:

Panhel, Pi Beta Phi to debate
size of sorority’s first pledge class

 

By Jennifer Mayo
Staff Reporter

 

Move over Chi Omega, Kappa
Kappa Gamma, and Kappa Alpha
Theta, because if national panhellenic
and sorority officers can reach agree-
ment on a rush quota change by
October 1, Pi Beta Phi will be the
next sorority to colonize at W&L.

The national leaders of all sororities
presently on campus as well as those
of Pi Beta Phi have been discussing
possible quota adjustments to make
colonization for the new group both
attractive and successful, Washington
and Lee’s Panhellenic President Dale
Wyatt told sorority representatives
Tuesday night.

Quota, the predetermined number
of members that each sorority chapter
aims to gain through rush, can be the
major determinant in a colony’s suc-
cess or failure. As Panhellenic learn-
ed last year, the lack of an effective
quota adjustment contributed to Delta
Gamma’s struggle.

‘*We have realized the importance
of an effective quota change during
expansion,’’ Wyatt said. ‘‘The DG
quota change did not work; we won’t
even try it again.’’

Wyatt reminded Panhellenic mem-
bers that when W&L extended a bid
to Pi Beta Phi last spring, it was
accepted on conditional terms.

Pi Beta Phi National Extension
Vice President Caroline Lesh ex-
pressed the sorority’s concerns re-
garding the strength of a colony.

‘*Pi Phi would like to see a new
chapter at W&L, but we also need to
assure ourselves that it would be
successful in competing with the
existing groups.”’

Lesh said that Pi Beta Phi is
looking to be of equal strength with
the other chapters within two or three
years after colonization. The sorority
is requesting a colony 60 girls, which
could be well over half of all girls
rushing.

But the idea of a colony of that
size does not seem to threaten the
Panhellenic members at W&L, who

 

will welcome a fourth sorority with
open arms.

‘*Kappa, Chi-O, and Theta should
see smaller pledge classes as a
benefit this year, because those three
groups are presently encompassing
the majority of women on campus
and they are getting too big,’’ Wyatt
said.

Despite anticipation on campus,
Wyatt said that the possibility of a
quota cut for the three present soror-
ities is worrying their national of-
ficers.

‘Our nationals are trying to com-
pare our situation to expansions on
huge campuses, like SMU,’’ Wyatt
said. ‘‘They think that smaller
pledge classes this winter might doom
us, but they need to realize our uni-
que size and situation would benefit
from them.”’

The main concern now for all
groups involved is finding an adjust-
ment that will be agreeable to all of
our sororities on the campus and
national level. Wyatt has been in
close contact with all of the con-
cerned national officers and advisors,
and the quota change proposal is out
of Panhellenic’s hands until October
1, when W&L’s Panhellenic must
approve it and present it to Pi Beta
Phi.

‘‘We will try to give them what
they need to succeed,’’ Wyatt added.
‘‘For now, Pi Phi is still anxiously
planning on being here.’’

The new art

The seemingly never-ending expansion of the Washing-
ton and Lee campus marches on. President Wilson has
secured funding for an art gallery to be added to the front
campus. The building, to be built next to Tucker Hall, is to
house a collection of Oriental art that dates from as early as
the sixth century. It is to be called the Watson Gallery
— so named for the gallery’s benefactress Mrs. William
Watson and her late husband of the class of 1929 — and
will be an extension of the Reeves Center. The Reeves
Center currently houses a collection of porcelain artifacts
donated to W&L in the 1970s.

Our first reaction to the proposed building was, ‘“Why
don’t you use the money for something we need more, like
bigger dorm rooms or more parking spaces or maybe
another performing arts center.’’ We imagine that’s what
most students will think at first.

But one doesn’t look a gift horse in the mouth and
expect to get another gift anytime soon. The fact of the
matter is, the money for construction and upkeep of the
gallery was all donated by Mrs. Watson, and it is her
collection of art that the building will hold. According to
Wilson, none of the money for the gallery will come out of
the university’s current operating budget. That is to say,
this money could not have been used to build dorms or
parking lots.

We will reserve judgement on the architectural plan for
the gallery until drawings have been finalized, but we will
say that if the owner of an impressive collection of art
would like to see that collection permanently housed on the
W&L campus, we should all feel honored.

Mrs. Watson could have easily decided to give her
collection to the Smithsonian or the Met. Instead, she felt
W&L would be a fitting place forit to be housed. We believe
this donation, as well as the donation by Justice Lewis
Powell of his papers to Lewis Hall, the Reeves’ donation of
porcelain, and numerous other gifts of historical and cultural
importance, serve only to bolster the prestige of this
university.

Yes, we agree that there are many other things the
university also needs and that Wilson should work to get
those. But, we are also grateful for those unexpected gifts
which come our way and serve only to benefit our
university. The Watson Gallery is one of those gifts.

The new Phi

Maybe you’ve noticed, maybe you haven’t, but the Phi
looks different.

The most noticeable change is probably the appearance of
a sports front on the back. It was our hope that the sports
section, and thus sports in general at W&L would receive
more attention this way. You simply need to flip over the
Phi and you can make believe you’re reading the sports
section of a real newspaper.

Second, W&Life has moved to the center spread of the
paper. This new placement should allow its yet unnamed
editor a little more freedom to display feature stories in an
interesting and eye-catching way.

Also, the page headers are different on all inside pages
and we are making an effort to liven up the front page with
more art and graphics as well as photos and headlines that
tell the story.

If you like the new Phi or if you think it sucks, please
let us know. But please, write us a letter, don’t accost us
at a party or at dinner while we’re all trying very hard not
to let the Phi run our lives.

Hell, music, a

  

 

 

tion allows a
less traumatic
entrance for

international and black students into the W&L com-
/ munity, there have been concerns that the program cau-

ses divisions in the student body at large. It does so by
allowing, or even encouraging students to form cliques,
segregating themselves from the whole of their new
society.

That is a valid concern. Certainly, looking around
myself, I can perceive a degree of stratification in our
W&L society. But can we be sure that the Preorientation
program is a significant contributor to this situation?

Preorientation has laid the groundwork for in-
numerable close friendships. It has aided many students
in adiusting to Lexington and W&L. Is there really
sufficient evidence to warrant the suspension of the pro-
gram?

I trust that the administration weighed the evidence
thoroughly before taking action which might prove detri-
mental to the notion of Preorientation, with all its
potential values.

Perhaps the ‘‘logistics’’ of bringing the necessary
amount of people to W&L early played the largest part
in the decision to suspend Preorientation this year. It
seems the logistical problems outweighed the comfort and
well-being of our international and black students. If that
is the case, the W&L administration ought to rethink its
priorities.

LET IT RIDE
By Chris Swann

 

HELL: the state of standing in line for all
eternity, waiting for a beer you will never drink as
the keg dies right when you grab the tap.

I made up this rather silly definition at a party
before school started last week when, after standing
for fifteen minutes surrounded by smoke and
sweat, I got a cupful of beer suds for my troubles.

I read somewhere that mystics and oracles used
to look for meaning in the entrails of sacrificed
animals, so I stared into my cup for a while as
people shouted at me to get out of their way so
they could get to the now-empty keg. People make
no sense sometimes. Anyway, my suds held no
answers to life’s mysteries, and I was getting a
headache and adolescent flashbacks from Duran
Duran’s ‘‘Reflex’’ which some fool had put on the
stereo, so I wandered into the living room and saw
that the TV was on. Unfortunately, it was on
channel 26.

Whatever happened to MTV? You used to get
The Police and Springsteen and maybe even old
Led Zeppelin clips if you were lucky. Now it’s
guys who all sound alike and rip off lyrics and
music from older, better groups. They call it
‘‘artistic renovation.’’ Sounds sort of like the
renovation of the fraternity houses, and works just
as well. The best is the new Motley Crue video,
‘*Primal Scream.’’ After hearing this, put in a copy
of Whitesnake’s album Whitesnake. (Yeah, I own
one too, it’s OK.) The Crue is ripping off from
Whitesnake, who stole theirs from Led Zeppelin.

I guess it was inevitable; music went from
R&B to white rock to hard rock to heavy metal
to... pretty metal. You know what I mean; big

Orientation praised

To the Editor:

I would like to take this opportunity to thank
publicly the entire W&L community for provid-
ing such a warm and enthusiastic welcome to the
class of 1995 during the Freshman Orientation
program. Of particular importance to the collec-
tive effort was the work of the Freshman Orien-
tation Committee, and its chairman, Michael
Patrick, and the Dormitory Counselors, all of
whom gave unflaggingly of themselves. Planning
and organizing ‘‘ice breaker’’ events and staffing
virtually every orientation event — from place-
ment testing to airport shuttles ~— made for a
very smooth opening week.

Kudos also go to: Jim Arthur and Randolph
Hare and their staff who saw to it that all the
dormitories and other facilities were in immacu-
late condition for Check-in day; Jerry Darrell and
John Taffe and their staff who furnished the
prandial touches for several meetings and special
occasions, including the Friday evening program
in the GHQ; Jim Farrar, Rob Mish, Chris Bara-
del, Southern Comfort, JubiLee, and Gordon
Spice for providing a festive Alumni Association
BBQ and choral program.

Presley nightmare from the late ’70s. Now I tum

On the other hand, we have the ‘‘artistic’’
music celebrities like... Sinead O’Connor. Excuse
me, but isn’t a woman who shaves her hair
because she feels its beauty creates an image that
detracts from her artistic integrity creating an even
bigger self-image by dancing around bald and
objecting to the violence found in our national
anthem? So what if she sang at The Wall concert

in Berlin? So did Bryan Adams, and nobody’s
nominating him for incredible artistic achievement
(although ‘‘Summer of °69’’ has got a catchy
beat...).

Then we have Madonna. I'll give her full
marks for business sense in manipulating 200
million people into buying her product, but I can
rent Debbie Does Dallas for $2.50 and get the
same pleasure as paying $19.95 for Madonna’s
video of her masturbating on stage with two guys
wearing brass bras. (NOTE: I do NOT watch
pornographic movies. My roommate does. I find
them degrading, personally. Sometimes I just
happen to be in the room when he’s watching
them. Purely coincidental. I’m kidding. My
roommate and I are pillars of society. All I know
is, he’s returning the video.)

“I swear to God, I am going to
drive my point home, and actions
speak the loudest,’’ said Russell
Hirshon, candidate for the 1992 De-
mocratic presidential nomination.

Tomorrow Hirshon will spread his
word at Washington and Lee.

Hirshon has been touring college
campuses all over the state, wearing
loud suits and distributing outrageous
flyers. One ad features Hirshon sitt-
ing on a toilet in front of the White
House. The caption reads ‘‘Russell
Hirshon’s position on drugs.... Edu-
cate Don’t Dissipate.’’

The 31-year-old Washington, D.C.
native says he knows he cannot be
seriously considered for the Oval
Office, because viable candidates for
the office must be 35 years old.

Hirshon is a bartender and never
finished college.‘‘I don’t aspire to be
great,’’ he said.

special attention to grade point re-
quirements, rush and pledging proce-
dures, and the fraternity-chapter rela-
tionship.

Interfraternity Council spokesman
Brad Peterson said a_ historically
black fraternity ‘‘is a great idea’’ for
WEL.

However, Peterson said that any
new men’s fraternity would be
expected to work in the Rush system.

“If you want to be a member of
the Greek system here, you have to
accept and join into the Rush pro-
gram,’’ Peterson said.

A chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha
opened at W&L once before, How- !
ison said, in 1974, but closed after
about three years.

Howison said he could find no
record of why the former chapter
closed, but he suspects ‘‘declining
membership’’ was a factor.

Matthews could not access the
fraternity’s records of the former
chapter by press time.

Despite Howison’s enthusiasm for
the students . interested in bringing a.

eon ye

historically black fraternity Or sorority. !

to W&L, he did assert personal reser-
vations.

“I am concerned with the broader
issue of race in America, and the
present trend that espouses race and
differences ahead of our common
traits as human beings,’’ he said.
‘We can emphasize our differences
too much.

“It would be very unfortunate if
these [organizations] were created and
became the exclusive option for our
minorities,’ he said.

Freshman Marilyn Baker, a black
student, said the presence of a
historically black sorority on campus
would not pressure her.

‘I would not go immediately to a
black sorority,’’ Baker said. ‘‘The
people here [at W&L] have been very
nice to me, and I don’t think there
should be a sorority to divide people
who are racially different.”’

Hirshon says the purpose of his
campaign is not to make fun of elec-
tions. Instead the pro-education, anti-
crime advocate says he is tired of
politicians skirting the issues, and
wants to jolt society’s attention to
issues that matter, like drugs and
schooling.

Hirshon describes his approach as
peculiar, but says, ‘‘It’s better than
sitting still and watching people not
act.’’

Operating on a $6,000 budget,
Hirshon doubts he will qualify for
campaign funds from the National
Election Committee, unlike other
candidates,

“Others started at a half-million
dollars,’ he said. ‘‘If I had that all
hell would break loose.”’

Still, he hopes to visit campuses
in other states and maybe even make
it to the Democratic National Con-
vention.

Hirshon is targeting his message
at college students and ‘‘every uni-
versity that will have me,’’ because

he says students ‘thave more open
minds and don’t know the meaning
of the word can’t.

“If I can make a difference, im-
agine what they can do,”’ he said.

This is not Hirshon’s first run for
public office. He made a bid for
mayor of Washington, D.C. almost
two years ago. That was when Mayor
Marion Barry was secretly videotaped
and charged with using crack cocaine,
then planned another to run for ano-
ther term.

Hirshon said of politics at that
point, ‘‘I was just pushed over the
edge.’’

Hirshon claims he doesn’t care if
people agree with his views, so long
as they become involved.

“If you’re mad at me, then act,’’
he said.

Hirshon will be in Fairfax Lounge
and around campus all day Friday to
talk to students. He will hold one
scheduled meeting for anyone inter-
ested at 2 p.m. in Fairfax.

Library goes

on-line this term

 

By Craig Burke
Assignment Editor

Finding a book at the Washington
and Lee University Library will soon
be as easy as pushing a button.

A new computerized catalog
system will replace the present card
catalog within the next few months,
University Librarian Barbara Brown
said.

“‘We’re phasing out the card
catalog, little by little,’’ Brown said.
“The new system should be on-line
in November.”’

The computerized catalog will
enable students to find library

holdings by typing in key words on
a subject, Brown said. With the card
catalog, students are only able to look
up author, subject, or title.

The new system will also hold a
listing of sources available at the
W&L Law Library, she said.

The Library is encouraging
students to name the new system.
Entry forms are due by Friday, Oct.
11 and are located in the University
Center, the library lobby, and the
Law library. The winner of this
contest will receive a $100 gift
certificate from the W&L Bookstore.

““We're definitely excited about the
new system and all that it can do for
the students,’’ Brown said.

Magazine honors
W&L community

Colonial Homes features Lexington’s
renovated houses and landmarks

 

By Carli Flippen
Staff Reporter

In 1824 the students and faculty of
Washington College gathered to cele-
brate the campus’ new central build-
ing at the laying of its cornerstone.

John Robinson, a wealthy Lex-
ington citizen who paid for a large
portion of the building, donated a 40-
gallon barrel of whiskey for the
event

Today Washington Hall, as_ the
building was later named, stands at
the center of Washington and Lee
University’s Colonnade. The Colon-
nade, overcoming its ignoble beginn-
ing, will receive the Heritage Presen-
tation Award from Colonial Homes
magazine Tuesday.

Colonial Homes is a national publi-
cation devoted to interior design and
architecture. The magazine gives the
award in appreciation of a com-
munity’s work in historic renovation
and preservation to restore buildings
to their original uses.

The city of Lexington, Virginia
Military Institute, the Historic Lex-
ington Foundation, Stonewall Jackson
House and the Willson-Walker House
will also receive similar awards next
week.

“Through our awards for historic
preservation, we are able to express
our appreciation and gratitude to
those who have helped maintain the
magazine's unique perspective on

America’s cultural design and
heritage,’’ Colonial Homes Publisher
E. Michael Peterson said.

**You’ll be struck with this com-
munity’s firm commitment to preserv-
ing the spirit and tangible reminders
of the history that gives their city its
special character,’’ Peterson said.

Colonial Homes dedicated a large
portion of its October issue to Lex-
ington. In addition to the Colonnade,
W&L’s Morris House, the Jackson
House downtown, and two private
homes in Lexington were featured in
the magazine.

The magazine describes the build-
ings’ histories and architectures, and
it includes extensive color photo
spreads.

Lexington Visitor Center Director
Martha Doss reported that visitors
from 14 states and Canada have come
to Lexington as a result of the maga-
zine’s story.

She said the Visitor Center con-
tinues to receive phone calls from
readers across the country who are
interested in visiting.

Lexington is the first Virginia
community to be honored with the
Historic Preservation Awards. In
1983, Colonial Homes saluted the city
of Concord, Mass., and in 1984,
selected York, Pa. for special recogni-
tion.

Colonial Homes is a_ Hearst
Magazines publication. About two
million people read each issue, ac-
cording to the magazine’s figures.

Mrs. Lee’s recipes put to ae test

 

From the W&L News Office

 

Gumbo, stew dumplings, sweet-
meat pudding and Mrs. Maury’s
muffin bread.

These are just a few dishes
prepared for the Robert E. Lee family
when when Lee was president of,
what was then known as, Washington
College.

Today the foods are being
recreated in Lexington kitchens, using
recipes recorded in a 119-page cook-
book ledger which is part of the the

Virginia Historical Society’s Lee
Collection.
The ‘‘receipts,’’ as recipes were

called then, were collected by Lee’s
wife from friends and acquaintances
more than 135 years ago.

They were copied down, either in
her own hand or in the script of
friends and family members.

Anne Zimmer, a great-
granddaughter of the Lees, obtained a
photocopy of her great-grandmother’s
recipe book several years ago.

Since then, Zimmer, who is a

free-lance writer in Upperville, Vir-
ginia has been researching the origins
of the recipes and testing them so
they can be re-created with modern
cooking techniques.

Zimmer found that most of the
recipes were collected during the time
the Lee’s lived in Lexington.

She determined this by matching
names of women found in Mrs. Lee’s
journal and some examples of their
handwriting identified with the help
of Virginia Historical Society experts,
W&L librarians, the Federal Bureau
of Investigations and others
knowledgeable about the Lee family.

Zimmer says her book will
provide several glimpses into the
Lee’s domestic and social lives while
they lived in Lexington, as well as
information about the local ladies
who passed their favorite recipes to
Mrs. Lee.

For example, Zimmer said ‘‘After
the Civil War, those southern women
who had been brought up to run
plantations were having to take on
moré= of =the domestic
responsibilities.”’

‘Though the Lees still had ser-
vants when they lived in Lexington,
there was a shortage of trained help,
and even more critical, a shortage of
food,’’ she said.

Zimmer, who has used a wide
variety of material in the W&L ar-
chives to research the cookbook. She
says she’s found enthusiastic support
among Lexington residents, and that
the work seems to have become a
community project.

Lexingtonian Adelaide Simpso
recruited 25 local women to test
approximately 35 of Mrs. Lee’s
recipes. Simpson tried to ask ladies
who were descendents of or in some
way connected to those who were
consulted for Mrs, Lee’s book. Al-
most all of the test cooks are
parishioners of Robert E. Lee
Memorial Episcopal Church, where
the Lee’s worshipped.

Each cook has been instructed to
prepare one or two dishes, following
the recipes as closely as possible,
using modern equipment and
methods.

After sampling each dish, the

cooks freeze the remainder for further
testing. Then, after an honest evalua-
tion of the results, they may alter
each recipe slightly, to improve it or
make it easier to prepare, keeping a
careful record of any changes.

A sample of the second prepara-
tion is also frozen for further evalua-
tion. All procedures are to be careful-
ly recorded, so the ‘‘character’’ of
the dish may be preserved.

Next Friday, the women will hold
a “‘tasting party’’ will take place at
noon in the R. E. Lee Memorial
Episcopal Church Parish Hall.
Simpson and her crew of test cooks
will present dishes made as closely to
the original recipes as possible, for
all to sample.

Zimmer will also be on hand to
taste the concoctions.

“This project has been more of a

treasure hunt than a testing of
recipes,’ said Zimmer. ‘‘In compil-
ing the book of my _ great

grandmother’s recipes, I have learned
a lot about my family and what life
was like for them and other families
after the Civil War.’’

Lenfest Center starts first full season

 

By Jennifer Gladwell
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee’s Lenfest Center for the
Performing Arts will soon begin its first full
season.

The multi-million dollar facility has already
housed over 85 performances since officially
opening its doors in January.

Fine Arts Professor Al Gordon says the facility
has provided much needed expansion for his
department and has enabled the scheduling of more
and better performances.

‘The machine started its engine last year, and
now jt’s really running,’’ Gordon said.

Two Concert Guild performances will be held
at the center in the next three weeks. The Canadian
chamber ensemble will perform Tuesday. A faculty
recital arranged by the W&L music department is
scheduled for Oct. 8.

A newly organized string of performances
called The Lenfest Series, will begin in November.
Gordon described the set of shows as ‘‘an eclec-
tic performance series.’’

Featured in that series will be The San Francis-
co Opera Theatre’s La Traviata, sung in English on
November 17.

A show by The King’s Singers, an English

The Alvin Ailey Repertory Ensemble, an ethnic,
jazzy, dance group, will perform Feb. 27.

The series is funded by the Lenfest Endow-
ment, the Lenfest Center’s capital campaign, and
the class of 1964.

Also scheduled for the upcoming year are four
productions by W&L Theatre.

Saint Joan of the Stockyards by German
playwright Bertolt Brecht, is set in the bloody,
turn-of-the-century, Chicago stockyards. The play
focuses on the forces of religion and capitalism in
a corrupt society. It was inspired by Upton
Sinclair’s novel The Jungle. It will run at the
Lenfest from Oct. 31 to Nov. 9.

The Perfect Servants by Donald Richie
resembles a style of humorous Japanese plays,
called Kyogen. It will run Dec. 6-10.

True West by Sam Shepard will be staged Feb.
7-12. The slapstick musical A Funny Thing Hap-
pened on the Way to the Forum, by Stephen
Sondheim, will run May 22-28.

Productions by senior theater majors will be
featured in a Festival of One Acts later this
academic year.

their tickets free of charge.

Theater series subscriptions are also being
offered for people outside the W&L community.
Patrons may pay a reduced ticket price in advance
for performances they would like to attend.

MC finally gets
candidates

By Spain Brumby
Staff Reporter

With the Democratic presidential
campaign finally taking shape, Mock
Convention political chairman and
state chairmen are busy at work.

Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder
entered the race for the Democratic
nomination Friday, followed by Iowa
Sen. Tom Harkin on Sunday.

“I’m happy to see we finally
have a_ race,’’ Mock Covention
Political Chairman Jamie Tucker said.

Wilder’s decision to seek the
nomination makes the job of Vir-
ginia’s delegation easier and more ex-
citing, Virginia State Chairman John
Flippen said.

‘‘That will help fundraising efforts
because businesses in Virginia will be
more attuned to the race,’’ Flippen
said. ‘‘Also, it will give our delega-
tion direction in finding out how
Virginia will vote.’’

Harkin’s decision to enter the race
makes the Iowa delegation’s choice
much easier, Iowa State Chairman
Craig Lang said.

‘I’m pretty sure he’ll win the
Iowa Caucus,’’ Lang said. ‘‘Other
candidates won't get early support in
Iowa, so they’ll look toward the New
Hampshire Primary.’’

Tucker said that state chairmen
will contact Democratic leaders and
elected officials in their states this
fall to determine how the states will
receive each candidate.

Car tax hits
freshmen, too

 

By Greg Patterson
Staff Reporter

 

This year’s freshmen were wel-
comed to life in Lexington this sum-
mer with a notice that they would
have to pay tax if they brought a car.

And indications are that the new-
est class at W&L don’t seem to be
any more willing to pay the tax than
the students already here.

A welcome packet sent out by
city officials included a notice that
students would be expected to pay
personal property tax on any vehicle
they brought with them.

‘The letter said we were required
to register our cars with the city,”’
said freshman Mike Witsil. He said
a card was included with the package
that would ailow students to register
their car by mail.

According to city Commissioner
of Revenue Courtney Baker, fresh-
men who sent the card back then
received a letter explaining that stu-
dents who pay the tax in their home
state or who plan to keep their car at
W&L less than six months might be
exempt from the. tax.

The tax also does not apply to
students who live in houses outside
of the city limits.

Baker said she was not sure how
many responses the city received
from the mailing.

The mailing is the latest move in
a dispute between city officials and
students over whether or not personal
property tax on automobiles should
be paid to Lexington.

The debate began last winter
when officials announced their inten-
tion to collect the 4.25 percent tax on
student cars. They maintain that since
a car used by a student is primarily
kept in Lexington for the majority of
the year, personal property tax should
be paid to the city.

Student leaders countered with the
argument that students contribute

enough to the city’s economy already
and thus should be exempt from the
tax.

Several meetings were held bet-
ween students and city officials last
winter in an attempt to mediate, but

na Wa&L

the meetings failed and _ students
threatened to boycott city businesses.

University officials remained
above the fray, on one hand refusing
to give the city a list of student cars
by citing student privacy rights, but
on the other hand refusing to de-
crease the voluntary monetary dona-
tion the university makes to the city
every year.

Last spring, city employees re-
corded license plate numbers of stu-
dent cars parked around town, traced
the owners, and then sent out tax
bills.

Many students tried to get exemp-
tions by counting vacations and
weekend trips as time away from the
city in order to get under the six-
month limit, a tactic Baker says is
not acceptable.

‘*There’s no sense in sending me
a list of weekends when you weren’t
here,’’ said Baker.

‘*As I read the law and as I un-
derstand the [state] attorney general’s
opinion, if you have your car for the
entire school year, then it can be
taxed,’’ she said.

As for last year’s collection ef-
forts, Lexington Mayor H.E. Derrick,
Jr. said that because the city began
its effort to collect the tax late in the
fiscal year, it ‘‘statistically didn’t
make the numbers’’ that officials
expected to collect.

City Manager Jon Ellestad said
the percent of students who paid the
tax last year was lower than the ratio
for residents and also chalked that up
to ‘‘getting a late start.’” He said he
hopes to ‘‘keep it [tax collecting] to
schedule this year.’’

Ellestad said the city estimates it
will collect $70,000 in student car tax
this year.

However, freshman don’t seem
anymore inclined to pay the tax than
their predecessors.

“I’m not going to pay it unless
they send me _ something,’’ said
Katherine Adams of Pembroke Pines,
Florida. ‘‘My dad said not to do it.’’

Jennifer Burdick said she did not
know if she paid a car tax in her
home state of Texas, but said her
mother told her ‘‘if someone came
after me we'd take care of it.”’

to the sixth century Tang Dynasty,’’
said Whitehead.

“The Watsons lived in China for
quite a while. Their collection is very
impressive,’’ Wilson said.

According to Wilson, the donation
includes over $800,000 to be used in
the construction of the gallery.

Parsons said
authorization
for the building
came directly
from Wilson.

“My office
had very little
to do with this
project. Presi-
dent Wilson
handled most
of it personal-
ly,” Parsons said.

Wilson said the Fraternity Renais-
sance program left Parsons with too
little time to handle the new project.

“Frank Parsons has very much on
his plate at the moment. We want to
focus Frank Parsons on Fraternity
Renaissance,’’ Wilson said.

Wilson said that because of the
timing and nature of the donation, the
Watson Gallery is separate from the
Master Plan normally used for univer-
sity development.

“We had been talking to Mrs.
Watson for a number of years about
making this donation. The three trusts
containing the Watson estate were to
have been donated to the university at

  

eee eee

the time of her death,’’ Wilson said.

Mrs. Watson asked that the money
be transferred to W&L early so that
she could be actively involved in the
new addition, Wilson explained.

Wilson said he hopes the plans can
be finalized for approval at the Oc-
tober meeting of the Board of Trus-
tees, so construction can begin in
December. If that’s not possible,
construction would probably be delay-
ed until next summer.

Construction would last a year,
said Whitehead. The William Hall
Partnership, a New York architectural
firm, is designing the new building.

The president said he sent the
faculty a memo outlining the gallery
proposal at the beginning of fall term.
He said he will make a formal pre-
sentation to the faculty at the next
faculty meeting in early October.

Wilson gave a number of reasons
for not revealing details of the project
to the faculty earlier.

‘‘We only consult with faculty
members who are directly affected by
the project,’’ Wilson said.

‘“‘There’s no conspiracy here. I
have not been trying to hide this
project by any means,’’ Wilson said.

No faculty members were involved
in the construction of Gaines Hall,
and only faculty members in the
drama department were consulted
when the university built the Lenfest
Center, Wilson said.

down the street with a group of
people when she felt a hand on her
shoulder.

“T thought it was one of my

friends, but it turned out to be an
ABC officer, and I had an open
Busch can in my hand,’’ Hardie said.
‘‘The others had beer in cups, so he
couldn’t do anything to them, but
gave us all a lecture about how we
shouldn’t drink.
(op {At, first’ he was kind of ob-
noxious, saying shame on you for
drinking. Then he was a little nicer,
probably because I got hysterical,’’
Hardie said.

“‘They said they were just doing
their job, and that if we were going
to drink, not to do it outside and not
with beer in cans.”’

The president of Phi Delta Theta,
Douglas Lindsay, said one ABC offi-
cer stayed in the Phi Delt yard most
of the night, handing out tickets. No
officers attempted to enter the house,
Lindsay said.

Both Hardie and Lindsay said the
ABC officers were dressed like stu-
dents.

“One was walking up and down
the street carrying a backpack and
looked just like a student. Then he’d
grab someone on the sidewalk and
give them a ticket,’’ Lindsay said.

ABC Special Agent Roger D.
Stevens said he and his partner were
only in plainclothes Saturday, but
wore badges and carried guns to

WO URC Ur Ui Me RN OUMEITORLT Ty

 

identify themselves as agents.

Hardie and the other students who
were stopped were not taken to the
police station, but were given a sum-
mons to appear in court in mid-
October. Hardie said the ABC of-
ficer told her the summons was like
a speeding ticket.

Lisa Dunlap, substitute court
clerk, said underage possession of
alcohol is treated as a class one mis-
demeanor, with the fines left up to a
judge. Dunlap said the fines would
probably be $15-25, but Hardie said
she was told her fine could be $50.

The students have the option of
waiving their right to a trial and
paying the fine after their court date,
but she said the fine cannot be pre-
paid, unlike most traffic tickets.

Some students thought the large
number of arrests were unusual.

‘This was the most arrests I’ve
seen since I’ve been here,’’ Lindsay
said. ‘‘It’s the biggest problem we’ve
ever had with people leaving the
party with beers.”’

Stevens said he and his partner
were on a routine visit last weekend
and were not in Lexington because it
was the first week of Rush.

“I didn’t realize it was Rush
week,’’ Stevens said. ‘‘It [the number
of arrests] came as a surprise to us
and to everyone involved.”’

Stevens denied that the arrests,
were a crackdown on students and at-
tributed the number of arrests to the
students’ carelessness.

Generals win F&M Invitational

 

By Sean O’Rourke
Staff Reporter

In 1990, the Washington and Lee
men’s soccer team opened the season
by winning the Franklin and Marshall
Soccer Tournament.

This year the Generals made it
two-for-two at F&M, winning the
season-opening toumament again,
beating host F&M in the final. Unlike
last year’s 2-0-0 start, the Generals
now stand at 1-0-1.

On Sunday, W&L beat F&M on

penalty kicks to win the tournament
for the second straight year. But
under NCAA regulations, since the
game was still tied after two
overtimes, it goes on the record as a
lie.

According to senior Bobby
Weisgerber, though, the team doesn’t
see things that way. ‘‘It was basically
a win,”’ he said. ‘‘We came away
{from the tournament] with two
wins.’’

Both Weisgerber and freshman
stopper Alan Christensen agreed that
the first game, a 2-1 win over York,

Cross country looks
for ODAC double

 

From W&L Sports Information

The Washington and Lee cross
_ country program asserted itself last
season by combining its first-ever
women’s Old Dominion Athletic
Conference championship with an
extremely strong men’s season that
saw the Generals just a few points
shy of a  never-been-done-before
ODAC double.

The success of last year’s seasons
make for high hopes in 1991, and
both men’s coach John Tucker and
women’s coach Jim Phemister enter
this year sporting a certain cautious
optimism.

“Obviously, we have high hopes
for the upcoming season,’’ says Tuc-
ker, who has a_ stable-full of
thoroughbreds ready to go the dis-
tance this season. ‘‘Our team is trem-
endously motivated to do well after
coming so close last year.”’

Phemister can speak from even
higher ground, as his women won the
league title by placing seven runners
in the top 18 spots at last year’s
ODAC Championships. But the
founding father of the women’s cross
country program has his share of
worries.

“‘We could be anything from an
embarrassment after last year’s season
to a team with the potential to be
even better than it was last year,’’ he
says. ‘‘The thing that really makes it
difficult is the paucity of proven
talent. We’ve lost four seniors. How
we do is going to depend on how
those spots are filled.’’

With four of his top five run-
ners back from last season, men’s
coach Tucker should have little
trouble filling the spots on his team.
Leading the way is senior tri-captain
Charles Edwards, W&L’s top runner
each of the last two years. Edwards
finished last season strong by earning
all-region honors. Challenging Ed-
wards at the top will be junior Bo
Hannah, a 1990 AIl-ODAC selection
and all-region selection like Edwards,
whose best time was just two seconds
slower than Edwards’ last year.

That twosome gives W&L a solid
one-two punch up front, but Tucker
has even more talent in reserve. Sen-
ior Lee Parker is a three-year letter-
man who’s run as fast as 27:38 in

his college career. Junior Keith Rinn
had a trio of top-three finishes last
season, and his best race was at the
ODAC Championships.

Aside from the fab four up front,
Tucker’s team will benefit from soph-
omore Jim Gilreath and senior David
Phillips, both returning lettermen and
both ready to step in should the
opportunity arise. A healthy stock of
new recruits is expected to arrive in
Lexington, as well, adding further
fuel to Tucker’s growing optimism.

‘‘We did a lot of work preparing
the summer training schedule,’’ says

the third-year W&L coach. “‘It’s the [J

most ambitious summer we’ve had. I
think that enthusiasm will carry over
into the season.’’

Phemister likewise is hoping for |_

some carryover for his women’s team

this year. Though some of it is un- |

tested, the talent is certainly there. In

fact, Phemister says it may be the |
Generals’ most talented squad ever. |

But there’s a big difference between
what’s on paper and what’s on the
course.

‘*We have some great talent com-
ing in,’’ Phemister says. ‘‘But my
rule is that until they’ve run in col-
lege, I’m hopeful but skeptical.’’

What Phemister does know is that
proven letterwinners Jodi Herring,
Kari May, and Susie Wootton do
return. Wootton, a junior who came

on the scene last year, leads the pack }

after finishing first for W&L five
times in 1990 and earning All-ODAC
honors. Senior Herring and soph-
omore May both were instrumental in
W&L’s victory at the ODAC Cham-
pionships. Behind that group of re-
turners is another group that is over-
due for an impressive debut. Seniors
Nicole Casteel and Jenny Nasser,
junior Betsy Kleiner and sophomore
Lisa Rosiello all ‘‘could be major
contributors,’’ Phemister says.

With a schedule that includes
meets with perennial regional power
Mary Washington, a stern early test
against a strong field at the Dickin-
son Invitational, and a first-ever
Washington and Lee Cross Country
Invitational, both the men’s and
women’s teams will not get a warm-
up lap in 1991. The Generals will
have to be ready, and while it may
not be easy to repeat or go beyond
the successes of 1990, both coaches

was dominated by W&L, but that the
Generals missed several opportunities.
They agreed that the F&M game,
won on the seventh penalty kick, was
a dogfight.

Freshman Eric Tracy converted
the deciding penalty kick to give the
Generals the win in the final.

say their teams are ready for the
challenge.

‘‘We could be hot this year,’”’
Phemister says in words that Tucker
might echo. ‘‘We have the potential
to be even better than we were last
year. A lot of this comes back to
potential, and there’s a ways to go
between potential and performance.
But I can’t wait to see what hap-
pens.’’

an assist in the two games, said the
team showed a lot of character in
both games.

The Generals played shorthanded
in both games. Senior midfielder
David Hooker missed both games,
and against F&M, W&L played two
men down at the end due to ejections
to Murphy and junior Greg Williams.

Head coach Rolf Piranian said the
team showed a lot of character.
“This is a different team from last
year,’ he said. ‘‘The second game
showed that the kids really want to
win and that they have a great deal

of character.’’

Despite the win, though, Piranian
still saw some potential problems.
The team didn’t take good care of
the ball and needed to play better
overall soccer.

The Generals will take to the
home fields at Liberty Hall for the
first time this year on Friday and
Sunday against Carnegie-Mellon and
Johns Hopkins respectively. W&L
will play the Friday game without
Murphy and Williams, who will both
serve the one-game suspension for
being ejected.

Polo looking for most out
of every offensive chance

 

From W&L Sports Information

Washington and Lee water polo
coach Page Remillard likes to say
that he doesn’t have any superstars
on his 1991 team.

Never mind that the Generals can
boast of an all-Southern Water Polo
Conference selection and an All-State
pick, and a total of three Division III
All-Americans, too. No, forget those
guys. The Generals, who were state
champions and Southern conference
semifinalists and finished with a 14-
9 record, did it in 1990 as a team.

Well, come to think of it, that just
might be how Will Davis, Chris
Hagge and Alan Herrick earned All-
America honors in the first place.
And it’s certainly going to be the
way the Generals will have to get the
job done in 1991.

“I think we will continue to move
in the direction that we established
last year of team-oriented success,”’
says Remillard as he begins his 13th
season at the W&L aquatics helm.
‘‘We will be lacking in superstars. If
we do have a superstar, it will be
team defense.”’

Well, while Remillard isn’t calling
seniors Davis and Herrick and junior
Hagge superstars, their career
productivity is doing it for them. And
it is upon their broad shoulders that
the success of 1991 will depend.

Herrick, a defensive stalwart who
scores at will, was an All-Southen
pick in 1990 and has led W&L in
both shooting percentage and steals
each of the last two seasons.

Davis, a defensive stalwart who
scores at will (sound familiar?), was
an All-State pick in 1990 after
leading W&L in goals scored and
finishing second to Herrick in steals.

Hagge, meanwhile, has earned
Remillard’s praise as a bit of a
Michael Jordan for W&L water polo.
Hagge’s offensive skills make him a
bona fide scoring and passing threat.

Those three will play leading roles
in 1991, but their supporting cast is
much more than a_ handful of
Hollywood extras. Sophomore Greg
Golub had an impressive first season,
and he will be the W&L 2-meter
man. Golub forced a team-high 25
kickouts in 1990, and that guile will
need to be part of his game again
this season.

Remillard said he also expects big
things from previous backstage types

like the markedly improved senior
John Kannapell and junior speedster
Andrew Pearson, who showed his
flexibility last season by filling at
goal.

The other key to the W&L unit
will be goalie P.J. Waicus, who is
more than ready to rough up the
waters after sitting out the majority
of last season with an eye injury. The
junior’s 6-4 size and accompanying
wing span make him an almost
prototypical big-time goalie, and he
showed a flash of that brilliance
when he made 12 saves in a game
against Richmond last year.

As Remillard stressed, defense
will be the key for the Generals.
Herrick and Davis combined for over
100 steals last year, and they will
have to pick up where they left off.

And anyone who thinks all the
talk about defense is so much
coaching rhetoric need only look at
the numbers from 1990. W&L was
11-1 when it held opponents to 9
goals or less last season. For a team
that averaged less than 12 goals an
outing, that kind of defense is key.

‘We need to play low-scoring
affairs to be successful,’’ Remillard
says, indicating that controlled tempo
will place a premium on possessions.
‘‘We need to deny our opponents
opportunities and utilize our
possessions effectively.’’

Offensively, W&L will try to use
its speed to great effect. Pearson is
the fastest freestyler at W&L, and
Hagge’s quick moves will be integral
to the Generals’ offensive plans.

‘*We need to accentuate our speed
and conditioning, and we have to get
the most out of every possession,”
Remillard says. ‘‘We need to get as
many kick-outs as we can. This is a
bright team. I think they have the
potential to do that.’’

If the Generals can do that, they
will find themselves in the thick of
the conference championship race
with perennial arch-rival Richmond,
perennial league champion Arkansas-
Little Rock and new league rival
Dayton, host of this year’s Southern
Water Polo Conference
championships.

‘‘Any one of those four will have
a chance,’’ Remillard says. ‘‘To be
successful, we are going to have to
pull off some upsets. We need good
leadership and commitment from our
players. If we get that, the upsets will
follow.”’

early losses

After a slow start, the Washington
and Lee volleyball team rebounded to
win two matches at Shenandoah
Tuesday night.

After losing four matches in the
Gettysburg Tournament over the
weekend, the Generals beat Shenan-
doah 15-12, 16-14 and Marymount
14-16, 16-14, 15-7.

‘We played really well Tuesday
night, especially against Marymount,’
said head coach Susan Dittman. ‘‘We
were match point down and came
back and won the third game de-
cisively. Hopefully, it will be a turn-
ing point for the season. We really
played together.’’

Senior Mena McGowin led the
team with 28 kills Tuesday night to
go with the 68 she registered over
the weekend. Freshman setter Michele
Ralston added 49 assists Tuesday in
five games. In eight games at Gettys-
burg, she had just 39. Junior Leslie
Hess also had a strong showing Tues-
day with 12 kills and 21 digs.

Dittman said the difference in the
turnaround was serve receiving. ‘‘We
made less than two errors per game
on Tuesday,’’ she said. ‘‘We made
twice that at Gettysburg.”’

The Generals host the W&L Tour-
nament this weekend. Matches start at
5 p.m. on Friday and 9 a.m. on Sat-
urday. The Generals play host to
Carnegie Mellon, Goucher, Meredith,
Washington and Jefferson, and Win-

Women’s soccer tops Lync

Washington and Lee women’s
soccer rebounded from a season-
opening loss with a solid 3-0 win
over Lynchburg Tuesday on Liberty
Hall Field.

The win came three days after a
2-1 loss at Denison to start the
season. Denison is ranked ninth in
Division II.

Head coach Janine Hathorn at-
tributes her team’s strong play to the
depth of the team. ‘‘The substitutes
and how well they played were really
the key,”’ she said.

Against Lynchburg, sophomore
Karen Stutzmann scored the lone goal
of the first half off an assist from
junior Andrea Cardamone.

In the second half, W&L wasted
little time putting the game away.
Stutzmann scored again off an assist
from junior Susan Moseley at the
41:03 mark, and classmate Corinda
Hankins scored 18 seconds later from
30-yards out to make it 3-0.

From that point on, the defense
took over, led by senior All-South
sweeper Nancy Mitchell and soph-
omore goalie Kate Stimeling, and
kept the Hornets off the board the
rest of the way.

“It was exciting — it’s always ex-

CROSS COUNTRY, FOOTBALL, SOCCER, VOLLEYBALL, WATER POLO

citing to win,’’ said Hathorn. ‘‘We
came very well-prepared to play a
tough Lynchburg team, and we
played a very good game.’’

Hathorn was pleased with Hankins
and Stutzmann, who will again be
looked upon to carry the offensive
burden.

Hathom was also pleased with
Stimeling’s play in the net. ‘‘It
could have changed the whole nature
of the game if she hadn’t made some
of the saves she did in the first
half,"’ she said.

“Tt was fun to see our potential
blossom,’’ she said. ‘‘I feel like
we’re that good, and it’s fun to see it
happen,’’ said Hathorn, who believes
her team’s success comes largely
from the fact that all her players put
in their best effort.

The team was mentioned in the

‘also receiving votes’’ category in
the latest rankings poll.
Against Denison, Cardamone

scored the only goal off an assist
from sophomore Angie Carrington
while Stimeling racked up 15 saves
in goal.

“‘T was really pleased with our
performance,’’ said Hathorn. ‘‘We
played a very tough team very well,
and I’m proud of our effort.’’

Stimeling kept the game even
with another strong performance, the
norm for her first two years.‘‘She

kept us in the game at some really
critical times,’’ Hathorn said. ‘‘I
thought Cardamone also played really
well.”’

The opening part of the schedule
was not an easy one, and Hathorn
was pleased with the way her team
responded to the challenge.

“‘T thought it was a great beginn-
ing,’’ the coach said. ‘‘It was a
tough one, but I thought we did
really well with it. It was the best
way to go.”’

The Generals are now 1-1, 1-0 in
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
play, and the outlook for the rest of
the season is good. Twenty-three of
25 lettermen return from a team
which came just one penalty kick
short of an ODAC title last season.

Despite the early success, Hathom
is not getting too excited too early.

‘*We are taking things like a one-
day-at-a-time team, just to keep
things in perspective. I’m very op-
timistic, but I don’t want to put the
cart before the horse,’’ she said.

Virginia Wesleyan will be the
next ODAC challenger for the
Generals at 2:00 p.m. Saturday at
Liberty Hall Field.

‘Every time we play Virginia Wes-
leyan, they’re always up for it and
very physical. We're expecting a
very tough game,”’ she said.

Wasps blank Generals in opener —

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

Washington and Lee head football
coach Gary Fallon knew that last
Saturday’s season opener against
Emory and Henry would key on his
defense.

“*T just hope that if the defense
bends,’’ he said, ‘‘they don’t break.’’

For 58 minutes, the defense held
strong, but in the 59th minute,
E&H’s Todd Lee scored his second
touchdown of the day, giving the
Wasps a 14-0 lead with 1:52 left.

The game was a defensive strug-
gle, and the E&H offense managed to
keep the W&L defense on the field
long enough to win the game. All
told, the W&L defense spent 36
minutes on the field, compared to just
24 for the E&H defense. E&H ran 77
plays, 64 running, to W&L’s SO.

“I think conditioning was sig-
nificantly in our favor,’’ said Fallon.
‘‘We were able to take the heat,
work hard and still play pretty cred-
ible defense.”’

It was junior Lyle Smith who
sparked the defense, making a career-
high 26 tackles. Senior John McCal-
lum showed his preseason All-Amer-
ica form, recording 15 tackles and a
sack. Seniors Trey Cox and Greg

Kiehl, sophomore Don Dempsey, and
freshman Jason Chartrand were also
in double figures in tackles.

“Kiehl and [sophomore Phil]
Spears played real well,’’ said Fallon.
‘*McCallum was outstanding. Smith,
Dempsey, [senior John] Ormdorff,
[senior] Scott Williamson and [senior]
Dave Frankhouser all have got the
capabilities of being outstanding
players.’’

Chartrand, starting in place of the
injured Thomas May, also made three
of his tackles in the backfield.

‘‘He made some freshman mis-
takes,’’ said Fallon, ‘‘but he is going
to be a good player.”’

It was the defense that provided
the offense with its best opportunity
of the game. Cox intercepted an E&H
pass late in the second quarter at the
E&H 38 with W&L trailing 6-0.

From there, the offense went on
its lone sustained drive of the after-
noon. W&L used the minning of
junior tailback Wade Robinett and
senior quarterback Fred Renneker to
reach the E&H 6 yard line.

On third down and one, Robinett
was stopped short of the first down,
and on fourth down, Renneker’s pass
was incomplete in the end zone.

E&H took over on their own six
but failed to get a first down, and
W&L almost got another break when

freshman Michael MacLane almost
blocked a punt but ran into the kick-
er, giving the Wasps a first down and
enabling thém to run out the clock.

On the day, the W&L offense
gained just 65 yards, 23 on the
ground and 42 through the air. Ren-
neker completed five of 17 passes
and was sacked four times. Robinett
led the ground attack with 30 yards
on 11 carries.

‘Offensively, we did some nice
things,’’ said Fallon. ‘‘We need to
get sharper on our pass routes and
getting open, but we did a pretty
decent job against a quick, big de-
fense. They were quicker than they
were last year.’’

On the whole, Fallon was pleased
with his team’s performance. ‘‘We
did a lot of nice things considering
they are picked to win the Old Dom-
inion Athletic Conference,’’ he said.
‘‘They are not a bad football team.
They were big, quick and deep. They
used three sets of running backs, and
they all were big strong runners.”’

Lee, who scored on runs of: two-
and 12-yards, was the second string
tailback.

Despite the loss, the team was not
discouraged with the loss. ‘‘We are
not discouraged at all,’’ he said. ‘‘We
prepared hard, and we are a little
disappointed because we went down

there to win and didn’t. But the first ’
thing the team wanted to know on,
Sunday was how could they get
better.”’

Next up for the Generals is the,
home opener against the University of
Alabama-Birmingham, in its first year ‘
of football. ;

W&L doesn’t know that much
about the Blazers except that they are /
big and deep and have a coaching .
staff on a par with many Division I
teams. ,

Former National Football League ,
running back Joe Cribbs and former
Canadian Football League quarterback '
Dieter Brock coach their respective ,
positions.

‘‘They have lost to two pretty’
good teams,’’ Fallon said. ‘‘They’ve ,
got speed, size and quickness and a
pro-style offensive attack where they ‘
throw to the backs. They’ve got 97 ,
kids who are all good athletes.

‘‘We’ll have to keep them from ‘
having success early,’’ Fallon said. ‘‘I ,
hope our defense can come up with
another strong performance, and we °
get our offensive performance ,
going.”’

Saturday’s game is W&L’s Hall ’
of Fame Game and will start at 1:30 ,
on Wilson Field.
