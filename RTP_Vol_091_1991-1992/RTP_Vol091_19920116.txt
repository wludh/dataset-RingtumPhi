Women wrap up
fourth Rush

 

By PAMELA KELLEY
Phi Associate Editor

‘

 

More than 100 women are ex-
‘pected to accept bids this evening
, from one of Washington and Lee’s

three established sororities or its Pi
* Beta Phi colony.
, _W&L’s fourth sorority Rush
ended last night. Rushees gathered in
» the university Dining Hall after the
, last set of parties to rank the sorori-
ties in order of preference.

According to Panhellenic Presi-
dent Dale Wyatt, 160 women attend-
ed the opening Rush parties on Fri-
day. Wyatt declined to release the
number of women who signed prefer-
ence cards last night.

Bid matching, the process by
which sorority representatives choose
new members, began this morning
and lasted into the early afternoon.

While Wyatt said she thought the
Rush was successful, PHC Rush
Chairman Brannon Aden said the
degree of its success depends on how*”
many girls pledge the new colony.

‘*We won’t know how successful,
until we find out what happened with
Pi Phi,’’ Aden said.

‘We knew this would be chal-
lenging,’’ Pi Phi Grand Vice Presi-
dent of Membership Carolyn Lesh
commented on the sorority’s first
Rush at W&L. ‘‘We feel very posi-
tive. We have put our best foot for-
ward.”’ :

Pi Phi is the second sorority
invited by the PHC to open a chapter
at W&L. Delta Gamma sorority left

ful colonization attempts.

In 1990 DG put off colonization
when too few women attended its
first Rush party. After last year’s
Rush, the sorority refused to colonize
because it said too few women select-
ed it as their first choice.

However, Lesh, who has worked
on the colonization for several months
said she is confident Pi Phi will suc-
ceed.

‘*We were very pleased with the
way the parties went. I feel like the
rushees responded,’’ she said.

Lesh said Pi Phi is committed to
do whatever will make the colony a
successful one.

“It is our number one priority,
extension-wise, for the year,’’ she
said.

According to an agreement be-
tween the Pi Phi national leadership
and PHC, Pi Phi may extend bids to
almost half the rushees. As a result,
the other three sororities were allowed
to extend bids to up to twenty girls
“wach: ier oe +

Lesh said she was hesitant to
discuss numbers. She said Pi Phi
hopes to gain around 60 pledges from
Rush week, and may later extend bids
to more rushees.

‘‘We are committed. If we don’t
reach that [number] we will not
leave,’’ she said.

This Rush also marked the last
for founding members of the first
three sororities. Sororities came to
WAL in 1989. The last set of charter
members of Kappa, Theta and Chi
Omega pledged the sororities as fres-
hmen and will graduate this year.

Perkins: Delt could be gone

SAC to render decision
on chapter’s fate Friday

 

By THOMAS EISENHAUER
Phi Senior Copy Editor

 

Executive Committee President
Giles Perkins said he ‘‘would not be
surprised’ if the Student Affairs
Committee kicked Delta Tau Delta
off campus Friday for vandalizing
much of the interior of its house.

“I would not be surprised if Delt
were expelled or suspended,’’ Perkins
said,

Delt President Chris Barker and
House Corporation President Taylor
Cole will report to SAC on the
damage to the house at 2 p.m. Friday,
Dean of Students David Howison
said. SAC will then either do nothing,
expel the chapter, suspend it for any
number of years or place it on
“critical probation,’ SAC’s strongest
waming, Howison said.

Cole said he discovered the
damage to the house on Dec. 22,
Windows were broken, walls
destroyed, ceiling tiles removed and a
brick bar dismantled sometime before
members moved out to make way for
the January renovation of the house.

Perkins said he hopes Delt can
explain its actions, but that the
damage appears to have been
intentional.

“I hope they can tell us that it’s
not as bad as it looks, but from the
pictures I’ve seen this is a very
serious breach of both the Standards
for Fraternities and the conduct we
expect from our students,’’ he said.

Perkins said he saw about 40
photographs of the interior of the Delt
house that suggest that members of

the chapter purposefully vandalized

their house.

 
   

  
  

“It looks like it was systematic
destruction of property,”’ Perkins said.
“‘It was more than someone putting
his hand through a window,”’ Perkins
said.

The Delt House Corporation
responded to the destruction by
suspending Delt’s participation in the
Fraternity Renaissance program
pending an investigation of the
damage. Additionally, the national
fraternity and the house corporation
have placed the chapter on probation,
according to Howison.

Howison
said SAC will
judge Delt in
the context of
the Standards
for Fraterni-
ties, which
regulate all
fraternity ac-
tions. He said
i SAC discussed
aie the issue initial-
Perkins ly last Friday.

“After last Friday’s meeting,
there was definitely cause for con-
cern,”’ he said.

Cole agreed that the house was
damaged seriously, but said the chap-
ter can overcome the episode.

‘‘The thing happened, and there’s
no excuse,’’ Cole said. ‘“The matter
now is to make sure it doesn’t happen
again here or anywhere else on cam-
pus.”’
He said critical probation would
be the most constructive measure for
Delt and the entire fraternity system.

“Critical probation gives the
fraternity and the house corporation
and the system as a whole a chance

said. ‘‘I hope it goes that way.”’
Despite the incident, Delt still has
a future at W&L, Cole said.

The largest fundraising
campaign in Washington and
Lee history will be unveiled
next month, even though nearly
half of its $127 million goal has
been raised already.

About $54 million has
been amassed since the confi-

He’s running six months late,
but Old George is finally coming
back to Washington and Lee — and
he’s bringing friends.

The old wooden statue of
George Washington that stood atop
Washington Hall for 150 years could
be back in Lexington as early as
March, according to Branko
Medenika, the sculptor from
Birmingham, Ala., who is restoring
the statue.

Accompanying Old George will
be two new statues, one made of
bronze and the other of fiberglass.

Although university officials
originally considered unveiling the
new bronze figure during Mock
Convention in March, — students
probably will not see the figure until
May.

According to Assistant Alumni
Director Robert Mish, the unveiling
of the statue will probably occur on
Alumni Weekend after the Friday
evening cocktail party on the Front
Lawn.

Mish said the Alumni Office has
contacted spotlight engineers and a
company to give a fireworks display
at the unveiling.

However, Director of
Communications Brian Shaw said
plans have not been finalized for the
unveiling ceremony. Shaw said the

It’s not easy keeping such

From the W&L News Office

Nobel Peace Prize winner and
former Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias will speak at Washington and
Lee on Jan. 23 on ‘‘Lasting Security
in the Post-Cold War Era.”’

Arias is the latest achievement for
the Telford Distinguished Lecture
Series, which also booked former
U.S. President Jimmy Carter to speak
in April.

The series was endowed by the
late Robert Lee Telford, °22, and
Arias will be its first guest.

A native of Costa Rica, Arias
holds a master’s degree in economics
and political science from the London
School of Economics and a Ph.D. in
political science he attained in 1974

 

from the University of Essex.
He was elected president of Costa

Rica in 1986. As president, Arias pro- }

moted development and democracy in

Costa Rica, propelling the small na- |

tion to notoriety as one of the most
peaceable, democratic and economi-
cally advanced nations in Central
America.

Arias’ efforts for Central Ameri-
can peace culminated with the Central
American Peace Plan in August 1987,
under which regional presidents com-
mitted to dialogue and consensus to
solve problems.

In 1988, Arias used the money
from his Nobel Prize to create the
Arias Foundation for Peace and Hu-
man Progress, which promotes the
welfare of the needy in society.

hurdle.”

Phi Staff Reporter

Michael Dukakis, the 1988
Democratic presidential candidate, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson and former Speak-
er of the House Thomas ». ‘‘Tip’’
O’Neill are slated to speak at this
year’s Mock Convention.

MC has also invited Virginia
Gov. Douglas Wilder and the six
remaining major Democratic candi-
dates, said MC Political Chairman
Jamie Tucker.

Wilder recently ended his bid
for the Democratic nomination, say-
ing that Virginia’s current budget
crisis took precedence over his na-
tional campaign.

Tucker said the candidates will
not commit to MC appearance until
after the Feb. 18 New Hampshire
primary.

‘‘We’re right before Super
Tuesday, and Virginia is not partici-
pating,’’ Tucker said. ‘“That’s kind of
a drawback, so we’re trying to plug
our Southerness.”’

MC Speakers Chairman Ted
Elliott said most candidates will be
campaigning in states holding prima-
ries on Super Tuesday during the
convention, but he remains hopeful.

‘*They’ve never had an actual
candidate at Mock Convention,”’
Elliott said. ‘But I have my fingers
crossed.”’

The national media will most
likely cover the convention, Elliott
said. He said he expects CNN, CBS,
NBC, and most Virginia newspapers
to be here.

Like all MC events, speeches will
be given in the Warner Center. Ac-
cording to Tucker, passes to the con-
vention floor are being printed for all
participating delegates. Other students
will be able to sit in the bleachers,

Elliott also said New Hampshire
Democratic Party Chairman Chris
Spirou will speak Jan. 23, three
weeks before the New Hampshire
primary.

Larry Sabato, a University of
Virginia politics professor and nation-

 

 

3 ally renowned political analyst, will

speak Feb. 27, Elliott said.

Bring back
Old George

For 150 years he graced the top of Washington Hall,
standing guard over our university through good and bad,
through the dark days of the Civil War, through the
presidency of General Lee, through two world wars, and
through the coming of co-education. But two years ago he
disappeared.

Old George is almost ready to come back, but the
tendency for our administration to make a special occasion
out of everything that might possibly generate some hype
will probably delay his return a few more months.

The university wants to plan an event for Alumni
Weekend, a great unveiling ceremony that will show off
George’s facelift and, no doubt, impress a few alums. But
that implies Old George is there for the alums, and he is
not. Old George represents Washington and Lee. He is
tradition; he is here for us.

Whether standing guard over the Colonnade during the
Battle of Lexington, dressed in a tuxedo for Fancy Dress, or
calmly enduring another whitewash, George has been there
in good times and bad. We, the current students, are the
heart and soul of this university. We want George back as
soon as possible. Don’t play politics with Old George. He
deserves to be back home. His empty pedestal serves only
as a constant reminder that someone is missing.

It is said George will be ready before Mock Convention.
Why wait three more months? What more fitting an
occasion can there be for George’s return than having the
first president of the United States watch the university he
saved do its small part in the presidential election process?

Our advice to the administration: don’t wait any longer.
Many of us have never even seen Old George, but everyone
knows where he belongs. It’s never a bad idea to celebrate
Old George, but don’t stall his return. Bring him back as
soon as possible, but throw a party over Alumni Weekend
anyway.

Don’t rush
winter Rush

The current Long Range Plan, written in 1989, calls for
the institution of fraternity winter Rush by January 1993.
While it is a foregone conclusion that the administration has
missed that deadline, the Student Affairs Committee has
been discussing the logistics of the move for about a month.

But let’s not forget the danger in such a move.
Washington and Lee is not ready for winter Rush, nor will
it be in the foreseeable future. Besides causing mass
confusion, the move would completely disrupt our carefully
balanced social system and financially destabilize several
fraternities by forcing each to host a full term of Rush-like
parties.

Winter Rush stands only in the very distant future, if at
all. It must be the last step in a redesigned social system.
The university is only in the planning phases of the first
step: the new student center. We should only begin serious
discussion of winter Rush after this phantom student center
is built, fully operational and serving the purpose its
supporters seem to think it will. Only then will freshmen
have another viable social alternative.

congratulations and to briefly introduce the ‘‘Tailgunner’’
to those Washington and Lee students who have not had ,
the opportunity to take any of his educational and highly
entertaining courses.

Statistics say that one out of every six college
women is the victim of rape, and surveys of the
freshman class each year back the fact up here at
WAL. Statistics, one way of looking at such a
terrible problem, allows us the luxury of non-
involvement. Unfortunately, this is an issue that we
must become involved in, because it does affect
each and every one of us. Name six women that
you know and try to figure out which one has been
through that horrible experience. I’m one of the one
of six women.

When I started my freshman year at W&L, I
was scared, like most freshmen. I was alone and in
a totally new situation with very little supervision.
I met quite a few people quickly and soon had a
circle of friends to eat with in the D-hall. One of
the guys in the group caught my attention, and
soon we were becoming close. It was nice to have
someone that I felt close to. I had been slightly
homesick before that.

We saw each other for a while and even went
on a few dates. One Friday night, about a month
into term, we went out on a date, dinner and a
movie. Then we went back to his place for a while,
since his roommate was out of town. We lay on his
bed for a while, the only piece of furniture in his
room other than the two desks, talking, laughing
and having a good time, when he decided to kiss
me heatedly. I told him before any clothes were re-
moved that I didn’t want to have sex with him.
Apparently, he didn’t hear me, because he pinned

To the Editor:

On the heels of the appalling wreckage of
the reputations of both William Kennedy Smith
and Justice Clarence Thomas, I am quite sur-
prised that any responsible person would not see
that publicity given to accusations is indeed a
questionable aspect of our society. In both of
these notorious cases, the innocent parties, whom-
ever you may perceive them to be, were consider-
ably damaged by the extensive press exposure.
And yet in last week’s issue of The Ring-tum Phi,
the Editor calls for the same type of publicity for
any individual in our community accused of even
the smallest discipline infraction.

No one doubts that the American press is an
invaluable asset in keeping government honest,
but here at Washington and Lee our obligation on
the Student Conduct Committee is to deal with
issues of discipline which, especially in such a
small world, can permanently affect the com-
munity’s perception of one of its members. As
everyone knows, denials and vindications rarely,
if ever, receive publicity equal to that given
accusations.

 

me on the bed, pulled my clothes off and raped me,
all the while I was trying to push him off me and
get away while repeatedly saying, ‘‘No!’’

This was a guy I trusted; a friend and some-
one I had been seeing for a month. This wasn’t the
first time that he had kissed me like that, and it
wasn’t even the first time that we had been alone
together. I thought that I could trust him, and I
learned the hard way how wrong I was.

 

Our system leaves millions of
women in the same position that !
was in; alone, afraid and with very
few options. Something must be
done to stop this.

 

So what was I supposed to do? He was just
as much a part of my circle of friends as I was. I
couldn’t ask my very new friends to take a side. I
was afraid that they would believe him, and I
would have lost my only friends at W&L. So I kept
my mouth shut and tried to deal with it without
telling anyone.

By the beginning of my sophomore year, I
had still told no one, and I came very close to a
nervous breakdown from all the guilt and shame of
blaming myself for something that was most
definitely not my fault. When I finally told one of
my friends, I discovered that she has been through
much the same thing. The more friends I told, the
more I realized that I wasn’t alone. With their help,
I started to put my life back together.

Today things are much better, but occasional-

LETTERS

A sharp distinction needs to be made be-
tween an investigative body, such as the SCC,
and an adversarial criminal system, such as in
American courts of law. Our commission is to
keep the community functioning smoothly and
uphold the norms of gentlemanly and lady-like
conduct. For this reason, we have as much re-
sponsibility to the accuser as to the accused.
After all, the real purpose that this committee
serves is to leave all parties involved in a happy
and productive relation with the university com-
munity, rather than crushing one side or the other
in the dispute.

The Editor attacks the $CC’s investigative
process because it lacks a process of appeal
equivalent to the Executive Committee’s open
trial. This analogy is imprecise. Honor violations
deal primarily with a student’s contract with the
community as a whole. Therefore, he has the
right to adjudicate his dispute in front of the
entire student body. In short, the EC keeps its
actions confidential until the individual accused
finds it in his best interest to do otherwise. By
contrast, the SCC, in most cases, deals with
infractions of the discipline code by an individual
or individuals, ranging from personal quarrels and
fights to violations of dormitory rules, which do
not, as a rule, involve the community and will

 

not merely concem |

economics, mathematics, philosophy or physics. From my
discussions and arguments with Professor Gunn, I learned :
that honorable behavior goes beyond the classroom and that |
Mozart is sometimes superior to Billy Joel. He showed me -
that unexamined political beliefs (including my unhealthy «
attachment to ‘‘supply-side’’ economics) are actually more _
dangerous than a lack of political conviction, that perhaps
the academic world has a little more to offer than the sterile «
but wealthy life of a commercial litigator, and that the
Socratic method is a valuable tool and not simply the °
weapon of choice for fascist-like professors. Finally, he «
demonstrated that friendship plays an indispensable role in _
the bond between teacher and student.

I believe that induction into Omicron Delta Kappa is ,
the highest honor that Washington and Lee can bestow,
since the society stands for the university’s core values: ©
preservation of honor, commitment to tradition, dedication .
to service and pursuit of intellectual inquiry. When one
considers the almost five decades of service that Professor ©
Gunn has given to Washington and Lee, he or she would ,
be hard-pressed to name another individual who more
reflects the principles of ODK. Congratulations, Professor '

ly I still get extremely depressed. I have trouble’
trusting men, but I’ve met a few that have con-,
vinced me that all men aren’t like that. I still panic
when I see him on the Hill or at a party. Just’
seeing him brings back some painful memories. ,

Our circle of friends drifted apart as the year
progressed, and last year I even told one of them’
what had happened. He said that, having heard both,
sides of the story, the guy didn’t look at what
happened in nearly the same way I did. He saw it’
as a mutually agreed upon action and couldn’t,
figure out why I was so hostile toward him when
he tried to take me out again.

So you see, date rape does happen at WAL,
I’m not road cheese, we were both sober and I
didn’t lead him on and then change my mind. Now'
think, out of every six women that you know, one,
may have a story similar to mine. Actually, the
figure is probably much higher because most’
women don’t report things like this, even in sur-,
veys. I didn’t when I filled out my questionnaire
freshman year because I didn’t see a purpose in it.’
I didn’t think anyone would believe me if I said,
anything, and it was all my fault anyway for having
been alone with him.

Our system leaves millions of women in the,
same position that I was in; alone, afraid and with
very few options. Something must be done to stop’
this, and it has to start with the potential rapists out,
there. Think before you act, because what you
perceive to be an agreed upon act may not be. I’
now realize that there were things that I could have.
done to protect myself, but I’m not the one who
forced someone to have sex with him. :

not affect the community as a whole. Therefore,
these issues are investigated and, if necessary,
adjudicated confidentially by the SCC,

More troubling than any of the above issues
is the Phi's serious misunderstanding of the
delegation of authority. The SCC operates as the
delegated authority of the W&L student body. It
does not operate as a body with an individual
agenda. This delegation self-evidently was made
precisely to spare all the parties involved of the
embarrassment of publicity over issues which
vary from unfounded charges to those of a more
serious nature, The whole point of delegating this
authority to a confidential committee is to keep
these issues out of casual Co-op chatter. Does the
Phi really want the reputation of every student at
W&L to be subject to the judgement of people
hearing complicated and sensitive matters in a
fragmented or second-hand way?

Everyone is familiar with the old joke that
a liberal is a conservative who has been arrested,
and a conservative is a liberal who has been
mugged. In our case, I think that The Ring-tum
Phi's argument for publicity is the argument of a
student that has never been threatened by the
destructive powers of a frivolous accusation,

the only living founder of ODK,
established by him and 11 others at
WAL in 1914.

Latture was a W&L student, a
professor of French and politics, and
special assistant to two university
presidents, Fred C. Cole and Robert

Pub Board appoints Walsh magazine

 

By JASON KELLEY
Phi Editor

The Publications Board Monday
night appointed junior Jimmy Walsh
sole editor of the new magazine it
voted to create in November.

Three applicants for the position
were interviewed by the board. Senior
Paul Mazyck, one of the three, was
asked and agreed to serve as business
manager for the magazine.

Amid Pub Board anxiety that the

by Teresa Williams

new magazine would become a
Traveller with student funding, Walsh
said he is committed to presenting
differing viewpoints in his
publication.

“I'd like to make it perfectly
clear that I’d like articles from
students with different ideals. The
Spectator staff can send in articles if
they want,’’ Walsh said. ‘‘The only
criterion the articles will be judged on
will be the quality of the writing, not
the political viewpoint.’’

Walsh is the former business
manager of the Traveller. He said
with the formation of the Pub Board’s
new magazine, the Traveller has
ceased to exist.

He said he hopes to publish the
new magazine once every six weeks.
Before the first issue, he will present
a tentative budget and plans for the
magazine’s layout to the Pub Board,
which will pay only the costs of the
first issue. A name for the publication
will be chosen by its staff.

The sounds of music at W&L
Prof. hits the big time!

 

By FRANCESCA KEFALAS
Phi Entertainment Editor

 

The song *“‘New York New York’’ says ‘‘if you can
make it there, you’ll make it anywhere.’ A Washington
and Lee professor is about to find out.

Margaret Brouwer, assistant professor of music and
composer in residence, will be in the spotlight on Jan. 31,
in New York City. Her composition Third From The Sun
will be played at 8 p.m. in the Alice Tully Hall of Lincoln
Center.

The Juliard Orchestra, one of the nation’s best
college orchestras according to Brouwer, will play Third
From The Sun, as part of the week long Focus Festival of
contemporary music. Brouwer said she believes her
composition will be the only orchestral piece featured.

Brouwer will also be one of several composers
featured at a round table panel discussion.

The St. Louis Symphony Orchestra played Third

 

 

 

 

 

Brouwer

From The Sun a few years ago, according to Brouwer.
After hearing the piece she decided to revise the first
movement citing that it was too long and just didn’t work
the way she had planned.

Brouwer said she completed the revisions in early
1991. The New York performance will be the first time
the piece has been performed in its current form.

“It will be very gratifying to finally hear it,’’
Brouwer said.

Christopher Kendell, associate conductor of the
Seattle Orchestra will be guest conductor of the Juliard
Orchestra. Kendell approached Brouwer about performing

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Third From The Sun, after hearing a taped recording of
the piece.

“It’s very difficult for contemporary composers to
get their music played. This was just one of those things,”’
she said.

Most pieces are commissioned, according to
Brouwer, which sets guidelines and restrictions on the
composer. Sometimes, however, a composer will be able
to write freely from their own ideas, which is the nicest
experience, according to Brouwer.

She will have such an opportunity soon. Victoria
Bond of the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra asked Brouwer
to compose a piece for the orchestra. Brouwer said she
had ideas for an orchestra piece last summer, but was
reluctant to spend too much time on it because she had no
idea if it would ever be played. Now she has a forum for
the piece

Brouwer has also had her compositions recorded. In
1987 Aurolucent Echo’ s, a piece for solo harp, percussion,
strings and what Brouwer calls echo harp was recorded.
The New Mexico Brass Quintet has also recorded her
piece Timespan.

Brouwer expects two more of her compositions,
titled Two Pieces For Viola and SCHerZOide to be
released in this summer.

Brouwer began her career as a violinist, before
choosing to devote more of her time to composing. She

| said she loves playing the violin, but has always done
various creative things such as writing poetry and music.

“I seem to be the type of person who needs an
outlet of creative expression,’”’ Brouwer said.

In order to make room for the time demands of
composing, Brouwer decided to teach college level music
courses, Teaching at W&L allows her to pursue both her
interests in the violin and composition.

“It is the job for me.’ Brouwer said.

Brouwer also founded, and is acting director, otf
Sonoklect, a new music festival held annually at W&L
during spring term. The festival features compositions
from well known contemporary composers, and students
from other schools who won the right to attend through a
competition. This will be the third year of existence for
Sonoklect.

Auditions were held last week
for four openings in Jubilee, W&L’s
most exclusive women’s singing
group.

The new members will help
continue the six-year-old Jubilee style
and manner of bringing music to
Washington and Lee.

Kristin Barnes and Christie
Davis founded the group in 1987.
Jubilee sings mainly pop songs from
the 30’s, 40’s and 60’s in addition to
occasional folk songs. Their
performances are usually scheduled
by the Alumni House. In the past
they have sung for local civic groups,

senior receptions, and of course at
choral concerts as often as three times
a month.

Jubilee is self-governed and
entirely self-sufficient financially.
Business manager Sarah Briggs
explained that decisions are a group
effort. This includes the choosing of
the music which the women vote on
before purchasing.

“Everyone is involved in
making decisions,’’ said Briggs.
Professor Alexandra R.

Brown is the group’s faculty adviser.
She assists with auditions and is
always present before a tour.
According to new member and
freshman Melissa Wolf, there is a
spirit of professionalism, friendship,

 

 

Calyx photo
Some of the 1990-91 members of Jubilee may be gone, but there are new members waiting in the wings.

Jubilee makes the music sing

and fun that is diffused throughout
Jubilee, which was as equally
attractive as the types of music they
sing.

She and the other new
members, sophomore Ellen Dean, and
freshmen Lucy Cavett and Mandy
Irons will join the eleven previous
members of the group. Jubilee
contains a fairly equal distribution of
altos, second sopranos, and first
sopranos.

Many of the Jubilee singers
are in the Women’s Chorus or the
University Chorus as well. Jubilee’s
next performance will be January 18
at the Independent Union’s ‘‘Winter
Picnic in Lex Vegas”’ in the Warner
Center.

The Ring-tum Phi, January 16, 1992

By RANDY DEVERE
Phi Staff Reporter

For those student broadcasters who got
cricks in their necks during Channel 9 newscasts,
and the sportscasters who lugged tons of equipment
to Generals’ games, the Journalism Department’s
latest acquisitions are indeed manna from heaven.

With a new computer system that includes
teleprompters, and a portable Telephone Interface
System for WLUR, Reid Hall has been transformed
into a broadcast center that would be the envy of
many professional stations.

The new ‘‘Electronic News Room’’ system,
with a price tab of between twenty and thirty
thousand dollars, was installed at the beginning of
the school year. There were several reasons for the
purchase, according to Professor of Journalism
Ronald H. MacDonald, who along with Professor
of Journalism and head of the department Hampden
H. Smith initially researched the system.

“There has been a sizable increase in the
number of journalism majors over the last four
years or so, and that was putting too much pressure

J-School moves into the 21st century

The system has now been fully implement-
ed, and has permitted a greater degree of coopera-
tion between the various upper-level broadcasting
courses.

‘*We can now integrate at least three classes
at once,’’ said MacDonald. ‘‘We can have students
from the Advanced Broadcast News, Broadcast
Newswriting, and TV Production classes in the lab
working together.’’

In addition to making the Channel 9 news-
casts sharper in appearance, the ENR has had
another effect.

 

The ENR, used by many small
professionals, is a boon for both
students and faculty.

 

‘‘T have actually seen improved writing
for the newscasts, which is something that I
didn’t expect,’’ MacDonald said.

The other new addition to the J-School

has benefitted the radio station. According to de

Maria, the new Telephone Interface is the result
of conversations between the department and
Richard Spence ’91 and Franklin Daniels ’91,
who were the chairmen of the Student Telephone
Union last year. Seeing the need for a new phone
system, STU donated the $900 system to WLUR,
a gift that primarily will effect sports broadcasts.

The Interface allows a student to broadcast
from anywhere in the country where the Generals
play sports, without the aid of others. While this
might suggest images of ‘‘Saturday Night
Live’s’’ Al Franken carrying a satellite on his
back, the Interface is actually no bigger than a
laptop computer. It can hold up to four microp-
hones, and it contains two phone hookups, which
allow for clear and easy transmission of athletic
events directly to WLUR. According to de Maria,
this new system not only benefits the J-School
and the university as a whole, but one student in
particular.

“‘Now Jay Plotkin has job security be-
cause he’s the only person who knows how to
use the thing,’’ de Maria said. ‘‘At least, he
thinks he is.’’

 

on a lab that was designed for a
newspaper,”’ said MacDonald.
““We knew that we needed a dis-
tinct broadcasting lab.”’

But there was a more read-
ily apparent motivation that prom-
pted the department to act.

‘When we saw the way
our newscasts looked, well, we
desperately needed telepromp-
ters,’’ MacDonald concluded with
a smile.

This facilitated the pur-
chase of the ENR, which, accord-
ing to Professor Robert de Maria,
"brings the newscast to a new
dimension." The system eliminates
the need for hard copy, as all
writing and teleprompting takes
place electronically. In addition,
the system receives the latest
Associated Press and UPI reports,
and allows for the cataloguing of
all broadcast tapes.

The ENR, used by many
small professional stations, is a
boon for both students and faculty,
according to de Maria.

“Tt provides a_ greater
opportunity for the faculty to work
closely with the kids, and it makes
the students more marketable as
they look for jobs in broadcast-
ing,’’ de Maria said. ‘‘It also

W&L students won't buy
Cheating at Bookstore

 

By JOYCE BAUTISTA
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Cheating just doesn’t sell at Washington
and Lee.

Although Cheating 101: The Benefits and
Fundamentals of Earning the Easy ‘A,’ a satiric
book on cheating written by a student at Rutgers
University, has sold well at other schools, the
W&L Bookstore would probably not carry it,
according to Helena Roller, manager of the
bookstore.

“The title is enough to repel me,’’ Roller
said. *“We don’t think a book of that sort would
interest the students of W&L.

“Our kids are a little scornful about the
cheating business,’’ Roller said. ‘‘Some may not
do all the work but they are ready to take the
lumps.”’

Using his Macintosh computer, Michael
Moore has published the 86-page book, which
has already sold 1,000 copies through mail order
ads in student newspapers at Rutgers, the
University of Maryland and Ohio State
University.

Moore has compiled cheating methods
from teachers and students at Rutgers and
several other colleges as evidence that most stu-

dents cheat. For example, he says students cheat
by hiding crib notes inside the holes of ripped
jeans.

Despite its popularity, the book has caused
such an outrage that most bookstores in and
around Rutgers have refused to carry the book,
according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.
Moore said he feels that professors are upset
because the book points out their shortcomings.

“‘Cheating has become the American
way,’’ Moore writes. ‘“‘There are so many
different cheaters to emulate that it is actually
hard to choose a role model.”’

But the concept of Moore’s ‘step-by-step
stroll along academic Easy Street,’’ does not
appeal to some W&L students.

*‘Cheating is such a non-issue here, it’s not
even on people’s minds,’’ freshman Megan
McCloskey said. ‘‘People don’t think about it.
People don’t care about it. It’s not a part of
people’s lives at W&L.”’

“I would be shocked if I came across the
book in the bookstore,”’ junior dorm counselor
Heather Cooke said. ‘‘Cheating is just not a part
of the university.”’

Moore has no regrets about the book.

“I wrote it to make money,’’ Moore said.
“‘That’s the bottom line.’’

Money talks not of W&L;
Admissions says, ‘So?’

 

By MICHELLE BRIEN
Phi Staff Reponer

Washington and Lee didn’t make it onto
Money magazine’s recently released compilation
of top-ranked U.S. colleges, but Associate
Director of Admissions Julia Kozak said that
does not necessarily reflect poorly on the school.

“Different magazines use different
criteria,’ said Kozak. ‘‘They use subjective data
varying from one survey to the next. Some
surveys might compare SAT scores, others
students’ liking of their courses.’’

Kozak said she dislikes these surveys for
just those reasons.

“Prospective students read magazines
ranking the ‘best’ colleges. But for whom?
Students shouldn’t compare colleges based on
SAT scores or magazine articles,’ she said.

Kozak said she also feels that college
ranking lists are simply money makers for the

magazines. She said often college issues of
major magazines are among the largest selling
issues annually.

“‘Colleges and universities do all the work
for the magazines. Then the magazine makes all
the profit,’’ she said.

W&L’s ranking dropped seven places from
15th to 22nd place in U.S. News and World
Report's September ranking of America’s best
liberal arts colleges. However, the magazine
ranked W&L first in its best buy category.

After the drop in U.S. News, Associate
Director of Admissions Dan Murphy said that
ranking would not hurt W&L’s reputation.

“‘As long as we’re appearing in the top 25
— as one of the elite liberal arts schools in the
country — we’re in good shape,’’ Murphy said
in October.

Dean of Students David Howison agreed.

“‘The important thing is staying ‘Best
Buy,’ ’’ Howison said in October.

IU to host
Superdance
fundraiser

By ERIN MCKINNEY
Phi Staff Reporter

 

 

The Independent Union will
host a ‘‘Winter Picnic in Lex Vegas’’
fundraiser Saturday in the Warmer
Center.

The festivities will start with a
Picnic dinner at 5:30. Casino games
and live music will follow at 8 p.m.

The Boneshakers and Lost in
the Supermarket will provide the
entertaiment along with Southern
Comfort and Jubilee.

All proceeds from the event will
go toward Superdance, W&L’s
traditional Muscular Dystrophy
Association fundraiser which is
scheduled for early February.

‘“‘Any money we make after
breaking even goes to Superdance.
None of the benefits will go to IU,”’
said IU President Erica Ingersoll.

Ingersoll said she is not sure
what to expect Saturday.

“Everything is last minute for
Students here,’’ she said. ‘‘It’s hard to
plan on numbers.”’

There are a number of
volunteers who are lending their time
and talent to the cause. Most of the
fraternities and sororities will be
represented, ‘‘which is nice to see,”’
said Ingersoll.

“I just came up with the idea
{of a picnic]. I thought it would be
fun,’’ she said.

 

 

New law forces change in security policy

 

By ERIKA BOLSTAD
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Beginning Sept. 1, prospective
freshmen will be able to compare crime
rates at Washington and Lee to other
schools when choosing a college.

The Campus Security Act, which was
passed by Congress in November 1990,
requires any college or university receiving
federal funds to prepare an annual report
outlining the institution’s goals for crime
prevention and reporting statistics on
several specific campus crimes.

“The purpose of the law is for
campuses to be forthcoming with crime on

campus,’’ Dean of Students David L.
Howison said.

The law is intended to make college
campuses safer, Howison said. Eventually,
the crime statistics gathered by the U.S.
Department of Education will be another
criteria for prospective students to use
when choosing a college, he said.

The report must include statistics on
murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault,
burglary and motor vehicle _ theft.
Universities must also release information
regarding the number of arrests on campus
for liquor law violations, drug abuse
violations and weapons possessions.

To comply with this legislation, W&L

plans to publish an annual brochure with
these statistics, compiled following the FBI
Uniform Crime Report, Howison said. He
said it will include specific university
measures to prevent campus crime.

The Campus Security Act was pushed
through Congress by the parents of a
student murdered at Lehigh University in
Pennsylvania. The family sued the uni-
versity for negligence and then lobbied
Congress to make the release of campus
crime information mandatory.

W&L will not release the names
of individuals involved in campus crimes,
Howison said. He said releasing names
would violate student privacy.

on, faculty and students.

After examining the plan, the
board, along with the development
Office, determined how much money
would be needed for implementation
and the amount of time needed to
Taise that money.

Once these goals had been
established, the university embarked
on a leadership drive to give the
Campaign the needed momentum
before taking it to the general public.

“First we took our needs to
those who know us best: professors,
parents, friends, alumni and a select
list of people who we knew would
Support the campaign,’’ McMillan
Said.

Besides momentum, McMillan
said this approach will give the cam-
Paign more credibility when taken
public next month.

The largest proportion of the
$127 million, $77 million, will be
used to greatly expand the univer-
sity’s endowment.

Endowment, money held by the
university in investments, produces an
interest yield each year that is used to
support scholarships, reward profes-
sors for achievement, aid in the up-
keep of the grounds, and keep tuition

costs down.

W&L currently stands in the
lower third of the nation’s top 25
liberal arts colleges ranked by endow-
ment per student. The Capital Cam-
paign aims to raise the university
above the median.

University Treasurer Lawrence
Broomall said this disparity exists
because W&L, unlike before, can
now be rated among this group.

“If we want to compete with
institutions that have been [raising
their endowment] in a more concerted
way for a number of years, we have
a lot of catching up to do,’” Broomall
said.

About $39 million raised in the
campaign will be used to fund several
well-known projects like the Lenfest
Center, the Fraternity Renaissance
program, the Lewis Hall addition,
updating science facilities and the
proposed student center.

Included in the money already
raised are the early contributions that
paid for the construction of the re-
cently-completed Lenfest Center for
the Performing Arts.

Also included in the early con-
tributions are $5 million of the money
used to pay for Fraternity Renais-
sance. The rest of the estimated $12
million needed for the program will

Capital Campaign plans for W&L’s future

be raised from other sources.

‘‘We thought that a fairly even-
handed way of raising the money
would be to collect about half from
the alums who used and degenerated
the houses,’’ McMillan said.

While plans for the student
center have yet to take a definitive
shape, the problems with the current
science facilities have been clearly
pinpointed.

“‘Howe Hall is in a deplorable
condition and, with the advent of
computer science, we need to greatly
expand that area’s facilities,’’ Mc-
Millan said.

The university plans to spend
about $8 million on the science wing.

The other $11 million represents
five-years’-worth of contributions to
the Annual Fund, gifts from predomi-
nately parents and alumni that go into
the university’s operating budget.
This category is included as part of

Mount Vernon on Feb. 12.

Mount Vernon, George Wash-
ington’s northern Virginia home, was
chosen because of the historical con-
nection between Washington and the
university, McMillan said.

“‘Washington’s gift to Liberty
Hall Academy was the first of its
kind to the school and the very begin-
ning of American philanthropy,”’
McMillan said.

At the campaign kick-off, the
results of the leadership portion of the
campaign will be announced. From
there, the university will take the
Capital Campaign to potential contri-
butors across the nation.

“While all fundraising cam-
paigns are educated guesswork and a
leap of faith, I’m continuously opti-
mistic that we can raise the $127
million and maybe even more,”’
McMillan said.

“‘Good things come to those who
wait...and we've waited a long time.’’

That’s how head coach Verne
Canfield expressed his relief after last
night’s basketball game at Lynchburg.

The Generals waited 39:58 while
Lynchburg jumped out to a 15-point
second-half lead before junior Bob
Ehret tipped in a miss at the buzzer to
give the Generals a come-from-
behind 74-72 upset win.

Ehret was forced into extended
action when sophomore _ starting
center Robert Miggins, who had 14
points and 10 rebounds in a 76-67
loss to Guilford Saturday, sprained an
ankle in practice Tuesday.

The Generals watched while
Lynchburg opened up a 12-2 lead
early and a 26-11 lead midway
through the first half. W&L chipped
away and had a chance to go into the
locker room down by just six, but
Brian Coleman made a steal and hit a
three-pointer at the buzzer to send the
Homets to the locker room up 40-29.

Lynchburg scored the first four
points of the second half to go up 44-
29 before the Generals finally began
to get back in the game.

Struggling offensively,
W&Llooked to the defense to get
them going.

 

 

 

Ehret

“We played some great team
defense in the second half,’’ said
Canfield.

W&L forced 21 turnovers for the
game and stole the ball 14 times in
erasing the lead. W&L’s two seniors,
Mark Melton and Courtney Penn, led
the defensive effort.

The duo combined to shut down
Lynchburg’s Daryle Dooms. Dooms
scored 18 points in the first half on
seven of eight shooting, but scored
just two points in the second 20
minutes.

**Mark Melton played half of the
first half with two fouls and stayed in

Wrestling grapples with lack of depth
problem due to injuries to key performers

 

By JACOB KIMBALL
Phi Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team went into its tri-match
at Davidson undermanned, but still
wrestled two tough matches.

In the first match, the Generals
used a combination of youth and
experience to take a lead over host
Davidson. After freshmen John
Cochran at 118 pounds, Adam
Williams at 134 and Beau King at
150 earned wins, senior co-captain
Peer Soderberg won at 177 to give
the Generals an 18-17 lead.

Williams and King each won
by technical falls [more than 15

 

points], and Soderberg by decision.

The four wins put W&L ina
position to win, but Davidson came
back to win the last two matches by
forfeit. W&L’s John Conkling and
Stewart Green were both unable to
wrestle due to injury and Davidson
captured a 29-18 win.

Conkling, W&L’s 190-
pounder, is out with a separated
shoulder. Green, W&L's
heavyweight, will miss the rest of
the season with a knee injury.

Head coach Gary Franke said
depth is this team’s problem.

“Our team has very little
depth,”’ he said, ‘‘so injuries severely
hamper our chances of winning,

because it is very difficult to be
successful as a team without being
represented in every class.”’

The Generals didn’t fare well
against Anderson, yet there were two
strong individual showings. Although
the team was defeated 42-9, the
bright spots were Soderberg, who
earned his second pin of the season,
and Williams, who decisioned Chad
Singleton 9-4. Both won twice and
evened their season records at 4-4,

With six of his 10 wrestlers
freshmen, Franke heads a young team
with little experience. As he waits for
Conkling to retum, the coach hopes
his team can start to show some
improvement.

This marks the second
consecutive year that the Institute
for International Sport has selected
a group of Sports Ethics Fellows
from diverse fields in the sports
world to conduct research relating
to ethics and sportsmanship.

Work done by the Ethics
Fellows will be linked to the
Institute’s second annual National

Sportsmanship Day, which will be
held on March 3, 1992. All
participants will engage in debate
and discussion with the assistance
of a ‘‘how-to’’ packet and
introductory video tape.

More than 1,600 high schools,
colleges and universities took part
in last year’s program. Well over
1,000 schools, ranging from
elementary schools to universities,
have already registered for this
year’s Day, including schools from
every state.

In an era when substance abuse
and illegal practices, both on the
college and professional level, have
proliferated in recent years.
National Sportsmanship Day is
intended to stress the importance
and long-term benefits of fair play
and good sportsmanship.

This year’s nationwide program

will again provide school
administrators, coaches, student-
athletes, parents and fans an

opportunity to discuss contemporary
issues of ethics with a view towards
establishing a _ national
consciousness of sportsmanship.

he called the time out.”’

The Generals spread the floor
and went for one shot.

‘““We went into our spread
offense where the guards are
supposed to penetrate and dish to one
of the big men,’’ said Ehret, whose
nine points and nine rebounds were
both career-highs. ‘“‘But we didn’t
start the play until nine seconds were
left.”’

Baker got the ball and took the
shot, a three-pointer, but it rimmed
out.

“I just tumed, and nobody
blocked me out,’’ said Ehret. ‘‘The
ball came right to me, and I just put
it back in. It was pretty easy,
actually.’’

Ehret also blocked three shots
and played 30 minutes, his longest
stint of the season.

Baker led W&L with 20 points.
Watkins added 14 and junior Bryan
Brading chipped in 12. W&L shot 50
percent in the second half and made
nine three pointers on the night.
Watkins made four, and Baker and
Brading made two each.

The win ended a two-game
losing skid and gave the Generals
their first Old Dominion Athletic
Conference win of the season. The
Generals are now 4-8 and 1-5 on the
season.

W&L comes
through with

ODAC win

If you get knocked off the
mountain, pick yourself up and climb
back up.

After being beaten twice last
week, the Washington and Lee
women’s swimming team rebounded
in a big way, winning 116-65 over
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
rival Mary Baldwin.

After last week’s loss to
Charleston, the Generals, depleted by
sickness hung tough but lost to
Catholic 116-77.

With only eight swimmers in
action, coach Kiki Jacobs was pleased
with her team’s performance against
Catholic.

‘All of the girls swam really
well,”’ she said. ““The meet was
close, but if we were evenly matched
[in size], it would have been closer.”’

Junior Claire Dudley won the
100- and 200-yard freestyles and took
second in the 200-yard breaststroke.
Senior Jodi Herring won the 500- and
1,000-yard freestyle and was second
in the 200-yard butterfly.

Freshman Susan Fisher had her
best meet of the year, finishing
second in the 200-yard individual
medley and the 1,000-yard freestyle.

On Wednesday, the Generals
got revenge for the two losses against
Mary Baldwin.

Fisher continued her hot streak
and got two wins, She won the 50-
and 100-yard freestyles, the first and
second events of the meet, to get the
Generals off on the right track.

Dudley also won twice, winning
the 1,000-yard freestyle and the 100-
yard backstroke.

Trio leads W&L men
past Buffalo State

 

By SEAN O’ROURKE

One of the most important
elements of a championship team is
the ability to rebound after a tough
defeat. The Washington and Lee
men’s swimming team showed that
kind of character this past week.

Last Saturday, the Generals
lost a heartbreaker to Catholic
University 106-91. Coach Page
Remillard thought the team should
have won.

“The times were too similar to
the last meet [Charleston]. We were
swimming against a challenging
opponent and we didn’t get the job
done,”’ said Remillard.

However, Remillard didn’t let
the loss change his outlook on the
team. ‘‘Catholic really wanted to beat
us. They did some things we save
until the championship season,”’
explained Remillard. ‘‘We don’t want
to win dual meets at the expense of
our athletes.”

Junior Andrew Pearson led the
Generals with 24 points, with another
first place finish in the 50-yard
freestyle. Freshman John Rowe
followed Pearson with 17 points and
a win in the 200-yard butterfly, while
senior Doug Brown rounded out the

double-figure scoring with 12 points.

“*We swam well,’’ said Coach
Remillard, ‘‘but our character is going
to be tested.’’

That test came Wednesday
night against Buffalo State, and the
Generals had a resounding answer to
the questions about their character.
W&L dominated the meet from start
to finish, posting a convincing 132-74
win, upping their season mark to 3-4.

The Generals’ swimmers
recorded first place finishes in 10 of
the 11 events, finishing second in the
opening race, the 400-yard medley
relay. The outcome was never in
doubt from the third race on.

Brown, Pearson and Rowe
each recorded two victories, while
freshmen Tony Diederich, Derek
DeVries and Grant Holicky all
registered one victory each. The
Generals old winners were
accompanied by three newcomers.
The Generals will need the newfound
depth ‘as the championship season
draws closer.

The Generals close out their
home season this Saturday with a
meet against Georgetown at 2 p.m.
This is the last home meet for the
Generals. After Saturday, the
Generals spend the rest of the season
on the road.
