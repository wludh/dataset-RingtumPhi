Knick

gets 10
In pen

. By Cathy Lopiccolo
_ News Editor

 

 

Former Lexington Police Officer
Jerry Knick was sentenced Wednes-
day to serve 10 years in the state
penitentiary for his wife’s murder.

In its Aug. 9 verdict, the jury that
convicted Knick of second-degree
murder had recommended the 10-

year sentence.

During yesterday’s hearing, Rock-

: bridge County Circuit Court Judge

George E. Honts II, rejected defense

' lawyer David Natkin’s motion for a

new trial. Natkin argued that some
evidence in the trial was prejudicial.

“I am satisfied the case was well-
tried. You were well-represented by
your counsel,’’ Honts said.

Honts did agree to a defense
motion that Knick serve his sentence
in a protected environment, since he

, could serve time with people he had

arrested and testified against as a

' police officer.

The sentence comes two weeks
after Honts ordered a_ psychiatric

| examination for Knick. In the court

' indications of mental

order, Honts said Knick ‘‘displays
illness and

; poses a threat to himself.’’

The results of the tests are seal-
ed, but they apparently did not affect
Knick’s sentence.

In August, a jury convicted Knick
of the Sept. 29, 1990, shooting of his
wife, Lisa. Lisa Knick died the next

_ day of a bullet wound to the head.

During the trial, Commonwealth’s
Attorney Eric Sisler claimed Knick
had killed his wife so he could be
with his mistress.

Knick’s attorneys, however, ar-
gued that the shooting was an acci-
dent. The defense said Knick had
taken out his gun because he was
angry to find his wife at home alone
with another Lexington police officer.
They claimed the gun went off when
Lisa Knick grabbed it.

Physical evidence in the case did
not prove conclusively how the gun
went off, but experts said that shoot-

' ing the gun takes deliberate effort.

i

‘

‘

In finding Knick guilty of se-
cond-degree murder, the jury ruled
that the murder was not premedi-
tated, but was malicious.

Knick may now appeal the court’s
decision to the state Court of Ap-

peals.

Tear night:

Behold the sounds of brother-
hood, bonding and beer slides which
will echo all over campus this week-
end on the night all freshmen have
been waiting for, Tear Night.

Those who have experienced the
adventure in year’s past will remem-
ber to wear an old t-shirt and jeans
and expect a crazy time.

“Tear night is a lot of fun, a
little out of hand, but something you
have to live through at least once in

, your life,’’ said senior B.J. League.

Freshman men and women, how-
ever, might not know what awaits

, them. Tear Night traditionally means

that a young man tears his member-
ship bid at the fraternity house of his
choice, thus beginning in a lifetime

" of brotherhood.

Tear Night also connotes tom

all over each other, and students

EC hears petitions
for student money

Mock Convention request strains coffers

 

By Greg Patterson
Staff Reporter

 

Campus organizations requesting
funding from the Executive Commit-
tee should not expect to receive any
more money than last year, according
to EC President Giles Perkins.

The EC is holding budget hear-
ings every day this week. They will
deliberate on the requests and pro-
duce a final budget next week.

“It’s not going to be a good year
for any increases,’’ Perkins said.

According to Perkins, the main
reason for the this year’s budget will
be so tight is because of Mock Con-
vention.

Perkins said that in years when
the MC is not held, the EC grants
$4,000 in order to build up for the
next MC,

However, this year’s MC request
is for $16,000, $12,000 more than
usual. Perkins says the EC budget
usually runs ‘‘about $185,000.”’

Perkins said the additional de-
mand on EC money, which is derived
from student activities fees, will mean
that other organizations can expect
the same or perhaps less of an alloca-
tion than last year.

MC is ‘‘an incredible experience
for this school and we’re obligated to
pay for it,’’ Perkins said.

The total budget for MC is pro-
jected to be about $192,000, accord-
ing to data given to the EC by MC

 

Perkins

Administrative Chairman John
Donaldson.
Two other organizations with

significant budget request increases,
insuring that pursestrings wil be tight,
are the Student Activities Board and
Contact.

The SAB is asking for $62,945,
over $14,000 more than the $48,450
it received last year. The additional
money is slated to fund two new
ventures; a series of comedians the
SAB wants to bring to W&L and a
program of showing twice-monthly
movies on campus.

SAB Special Events Chairman
John Flippen told EC members that
the comedian series is ‘‘a big project,
one that we’d really like to start.’’
Regarding the movies, he said that
the SAB would be showing ‘‘second-
run’’ movies, ones that are out of
most theaters but not yet available on
video.

Flippen said the new programs
would probably be cut if the SAB
does not get total funding.

Contact, the organization which
brings speakers to campus, is also
asking for more money than last year.
It is asking for $23,800, $5,800 more
than it got last year.

Chairman Tim Gallagher told the
EC Contact needs the money to make
up for the $10,000 a year previously
supplied by the Interfraternity Coun-
cil, which voted last spring to cease
support of Contact.

Gallagher said Contact is trying to
cut comers already by planning for
speakers to stay at the Morris House
instead of in a hotel and by having
pre-speech dinners catered by the
W&L Food Service instead of going
to a restaurant.

Another demand on the budget are
two new organizations which are
going through the EC budget process
for the first time. The Exhibitionists
Drama Club, a group which travels to
area cultural events and is planning to
sponsor a ‘‘Festival of Arts’’ in Oc-
tober, has requested $1,080.

Another new request has been
made by the W&L chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union for
$2,150. Requests by the chapter last
year for funding for specific events
sparked debates about whether the
ACLU had a political bias.

Past ECs have been reluctant to
fund organizations perceived as politi-

‘The CRC felt that they had an understanding
of the policy,’’ Shaughnessy said. ‘‘But there is
concern on the part of the student body on what
it covers.”’

Shaughnessy said the committee will actually be
continuing a process of review it began last spring
term.
“In the past, the CRC has discussed various
aspects, some of its procedures and the substance
of the [harassment] policy,’’ Shaughnessy said.

Howison and Shaughnessy stressed that the
student body will have a voice in the review.

Executive Committee President Giles Perkins

The Confidential Review Committee will soon
review its controversial policy on harassment.

Dean of Students David Howison said he will
“‘set in motion a formal review of the CRC and
the [harassment] policy’’ in about three weeks.

The current policy ‘‘is ambivalent,’’ Howison
said. ‘‘I hope [the CRC] can clarify it without any
ambiguity.’’

“I'd be very surprised if the CRC emerged
with a single, unanimous opinion,’’ Howison said.

CRC Chairwoman Joan M. Shaughnessy,

Perkins said that he hopes students on the CRC
will be directly accountable to the student body.

Many faculty members support the idea of a new
building to house a collection of Oriental art but are
divided on where the building should be located.

The proposed Watson Gallery is to house a collection
of antique Oriental ceramics recently donated to the
university by long-time benefactress Mrs. William Watson.

Current plans call for the gallery will occupy a plot of
front-campus land behind the current Reeves Center next
to Tucker Hall.

Faculty members are praising the donation as an
important addition to the art department, but are
concerned over the destruction of the university’s natural
landscape.

“IT oppose the location of the building,’’ Professor of
History J. Holt Merchant said. ‘‘I have no objection to
the university expanding its holdings in art objects. I just
feel that it is important that we leave grass and trees on
this campus. That patch of grass adds a great deal to the
atmosphere of the campus.’’

Merchant added that there are several other things the
university needs more than the Watson Gallery. He cited
increased student aid, an updated student center, and a
science center annex as examples.

Other faculty members share Merchant’s concern.

“I have no objection to the university receiving this
collection. I would just prefer to maintain the open
space,’’ said geology Professor Edgar Spencer. ‘‘The
building would occupy a very prominent place on campus.
I object to its location.”’

University President John D. Wilson responded to
suggestions that the collection could be housed elsewhere.

“This gallery is part of the Reeves Center. It wouldn’t
do much good to have it 400 yards away. I feel that it’s
appropriately located,’’ Wilson said.

Associate Professor of Romance Languages Russell
Knudson believes that the Watson Gallery will be a trem-

Founded September 18, 1897

 

Recycling is not
just for ‘e-halls’

Segregation is wrong. All segregation is wrong, and it
seems that the administration is finally waking up to that
fact. Their liberal experiments with dividing the freshman
classes by race and interest have been ended. We hope
they have been ended for good.

We have already praised the administration’s decision
to end the separation of the freshmen class through a
preorientation program which brought international and
minority students to campus early for the “‘special help”’
the administration felt they needed. We now find
ourselves again in agreement with the administration’s
decision to end segregation (albeit voluntary) of the
freshmen halls by interest groups.

Last year’s environmental halls gave incoming freshmen
the chance to voluntarily live on a hall with other people
concemed about environmental issues.

That idea makes you want to say, ‘‘Dean Ruscio, what
were you thinking?’’ Why not house together people who
like gardening? or people who like big trucks with KC
lights?

The freshmen who are concerned enough about en-
vironmental issues that they volunteered to live on the
specialty halls should be admired for their socially con-
scious views.

We should also give those folks some sympathy.

To outsiders, it appeared that the environmental hall
students were banning together for some noble but un-
popular cause. They were therefore segregated.

Students’ willingness to cooperate in the specialty hall
project in fact cost them a fair and equal shot at integra-
tion with the freshman class on the whole.

Moreover, other freshmen were deprived of the chance
to interact with their most environmentally conscious
classmates.

It is certainly possible to promote environmental aware-
ness without specialty halls. The presence of recycling
containers throughout the dorms this year is one way to
do that. Making students aware of activities by The Out-
ing Club’s environmental section is another.

 

 

Simply put, it was stupid for anyone to think they
would promote environmentalism by  cloistering
enviromentalists in a designated hall. We applaud the
elimination. of .‘‘segregated’’ halls and hope we never’ see
their return on this campus. ~a on

Some sort of time-space continuum exists
outside of Charlottesville to dump college stu-
dents at Foxfield, I’m sure of it. I just cruise
around on the backroads until I somehow end
up there (sort of the same experience as finding
yourself at Lee-Hi Truck Stop at 3 a.m. on
Sunday mornings). Just go north on I-81, go
east on I-64, get off at route 250, and head left.

Foxfield etiquette: make sure your fraternity
or sorority has a parking space on the infield,
where the five thousand plus people will be. If
you do not have a parking space, you are a
dweeb and should go home and watch football
on TV like you do every other Sunday.

Also, bring the correct liquor: bourbon and
vodka are key, gin is tolerated. Anyone carry-
ing a bottle that isn’t Beam, Absolut or Gor-
don’s will be loudly and immediately ridiculed.
(Tequila lovers have my sympathies.) You must
pour at least a cup of whatever you are drin-
king down both your shirt and someone else’s
(preferably not your date’s dress, although the
resulting fight would be highly amusing for
everybody else). Be prepared to eat a lot of
fried chicken and potato salad. Wear a really
ugly or individual tie (flowers are good, the
bigger and more garishly colored the better).
Boots are a good idea, unless you like getting
mud all over your nice loafers.

Most importantly, have fun: drink, dance,
talk, scam, whatever.

NOTE: somebody around here has to be
responsible. If you drive, don’t drink. Aside
from drunk driving being detrimental to your
health, and someone else’s, the Virginia High-
way Patrol camps out along the backroads and
I-81 after Foxfield. They have more of a field
day than you do. If no one is willing to drive,
hire a bus and shout at the driver for entertain-
ment. Makes for a really messy trip.

And, of course, the highlight: leaving. This
takes twice as long as getting in, and it almost
always seems to rain. Rule of thumb: make
sure someone in your car is wasted. He or she
will be happy to entertain you all the way back
to Lexington.

Ten years too
little for Knick

MY VIEW
By Rick Peltz

 

 

I went to the sentencing of former Lexington police
officer Jerry Knick yesterday.

Knick was found guilty on Aug. 9 of second degree
murder in the shooting death of his wife.

In Knick’s sentencing hearing, there were no tearful
pleas from family. There was just the account of the
crime, written from a transcript of the trial; a pre-sen-
tence report; and, of course, Knick himself. He looked
depressed — and introspective.

Knick was sentenced to the jury-recommended 10-
year term in the state penitentiary.

Though the Knick case was a rather different crime
by its domestic nature, it did remind me of a case in

Baltimore _last

If the state of ig 8. Canoe

I note, first,

a crime, then 20
years is what Knick
should have gotten.

that I imply no
similarities _ bet-
ween Knick and
Tirado insofar as
whether or not
they regret their
crimes.

Eric Tirado was found guilty last summer of murder
in the shooting death of Maryland state trooper Ted
Wolfe.

With the death penalty a possible sentence and the
sentence mostly in the jury’s hands, Tirado’s family and
friends did testify. They tearfully begged the court’s
mercy, explaining the tragedy that they experienced, not
unlike the tragedy Wolfe’s family faced.

Tirado himself took the stand. He said he regretted
what he had done.

The court ruled that Tirado serve life imprisonment.

One thing the jury did not know was that when
Tirado was led out of the courtroom prior to the sentenc-
ing, he made an obscene gesture at the victim’s family.
It didn’t look then like he regretted the crime.

It’s so easy to look at a convicted criminal in the
courtroom, like Knick or Tirado, and not picture the
brutal crime he committed. It’s hard to give a stern
sentence to the pensive, reticent defendant.

Tirado should have gotten the maximum penalty for
his crime, the death penalty. Knick should have gotten
the 20 years allowed for his crime.

Maybe the jury had doubts about their decision, and
they thought they would make it up to Knick with a 10-
year, rather than 20-year, sentence.

That doesn’t make sense. Knick killed his wife. That
fact was established in a court of law beyond a
reasonable doubt. If the state of Virginia permits only 20
years for such a crime, then 20 years is what Knick
should have gotten. i S

Where is the

Senior sees demise
of W&L institution

MY VIEW
By Read Folline

 

 

 

This ‘‘My View’’ was written after a conversation with
fellow senior Jim Cadranell.

Number one, this isn’t supposed to be a sermon.
Number two, this isn’t supposed to be a lecture. And
number three, I may be totally wrong about what I’m
about to say, but as a senior and having been here for
three years, I’ve seen a change take place.

Freshman year, I vividly remember a speech on the
Speaking Tradition. Along with the Honor System discus-
sion, this talk was the other one that really stuck in my
head during that amazingly fun Orientation Week (yes, I
am kidding about
how much fun it
was). Anyway, it
seems to me,
along with count-
less others I have
come in contact
with, that the
Speaking Tradi-
tion is heading

W&L was how friendly everyone seemed to be. I can
recount numerous times of striking up conversations and
new friendships just by speaking to someone on the
Colonnade, in front of the Co-op, and even while walk-
ing around town. I don’t know why this has changed. |
realize the school is much more competitive now, but
that doesn’t mean people have to stop being friendly. We
are here for an education, but we are also here to devel-
op lasting friendships. Hell, how can you make friends
when people either won’t speak to you or have too much
of an attitude to respond to a cordial ‘‘hello’’ or ‘‘what’s
up’’?

The Speaking Tradition is exactly what it sounds like,
for those of you who have never heard this phrase. It’s
a tradition of everyone speaking, and thus being friendly,
to one another. How hard is it to say something while
passing by? I'll tell you one thing, it’s a hell of a lot
harder to not say anything. I just hope this isn’t another
one of W&L’s famous traditions not able to survive in
today’s society. It has lasted for over 150 years... and it
Should last 150 more.

he does in Iowa and New Hamp-
shire,’ Associate Dean of Law Ed-
ward O. Henneman said.

Henneman, who is the head of the
Democratic Party in Rockbridge Cou-
nty, said that although Wilder’s sup-
port is low in Virginia, he appeals to
many middle-of-the-road Democrats
nationally.

Wilder’s approval rating is at 30
percent in Virginia, according to the
latest Washington Post poll.

“‘He hasn’t spent much time in
the state,’’ junior Jeremy Carroll said.
“It doesn’t seem like he is ever in
Richmond being governor.’’

Carroll, a native of Danville, Va.,
also said Wilder’s low approval rating
stems from his cuts in education

‘People in the rural communities
are mad because they were hit the
hardest by the cuts,’’ Carroll said.

Despite Wilder’s low approval
rating in Virginia, Carroll agreed it
was too early to tell how Wilder will
do in his run for the Democratic
nomination.

‘He considers himself a long
shot,’’ Carroll said. ‘‘He is trying to
present himself as a vice-presidential
candidate.”

Virginia democratic office holders,
including the governor, have tradition-
ally spoken at Mock Convention,
according to MC Political Chairman
Jamie Tucker.

‘‘Wilder’s decision to run_in-
creases Mock Convention’s desire to
bring him to W&L for the conven-
tion,’’ Tucker said, ‘‘but it’s too soon
to tell if he’ll get the nomination.”’

‘*What I missed most about W&L
was the involvement with students,’’
John said. ‘‘I just like being here.’’

John spent nearly a year away on
study leave to develop additional
courses. He retumed this fall as a
full-time faculty member.

Professors at W&L are given the
opportunity every five years to go on
sabbatical, John said. They may take
either one term or one year off for
schooling or pursuing academic pro-
jects and interests,

““My wife and I enjoyed travel-
ing,’’ John said.

John spent the 1990 fall term at
the London School of Economics and
Political Science. His winter term
was spent at University College at

Oxford as part of the W&L faculty
exchange
University.

John spent his spring term at the
University of Washington in Seattle.

“‘My wife and I took advantage
of all the cultural opportunites the
cities had to offer,’’ John said. ‘‘We
went to a number of plays and con-
certs.”

John is now teaching a class on
the British political system this fall
and a comparative public policy class
in the spring. He is also serving as
pre-law adviser.

John said his future plans do not
include any more administrative
duties. ‘‘Twenty-one years in ad-
ministration is enough.’’

‘91 alum
added
to staff

By Stacy Bogert
Staff Reporter

 

 

W&L alumnus Christopher Bray,
91, has recently been appointed to
the new position of administrative
assistant for residence life.

As administrative assistant, Bray
will primarily be concerned with im-
proving the quality of student life in
the freshman and upperclass residence
halls.

Bray said his goals for the year
include promoting health education,
increasing opportunities for com-
munity service, enhancing student-
faculty relations, and strengthening
the Dorm League intramural events.

‘‘Basically, Chris is charged with
trying to promote and improve the
quality of residence life at W&L, and
to make it more appealing for stu-
dents, especially upperclassmen, to
live on campus,’’ Dennis Manning,
Assistant Dean of Students for Fresh-
man and Residence Life, said.

Bray éncourages students to sub-
mit their own ideas for activities and
‘said ‘he believes in the power of
students’ ideas.

‘Any ideas, concerns, issues that
arise, they [students] should feel they
can come to any of the dean of stu-
dents staff,’’ Bray said.

‘*When I was a freshman,’’ Bray
said, "I felt like I wasn’t going to
make a difference. I got together with
a couple of my friends and we
thought about what we could do
about drinking and driving. The ideas
formed into Live Drive, an organiza-
tion that provides sober rides on
weekends.”’

As an undergraduate, Bray was a
resident assistant in Gaines Hall and
a dorm counselor in the Summer
Scholars program, 1989-1991.

Of his newest position, Bray said,
‘I've been lucky enough to find a
job with something I love. I love it
here. It’s a special place.’’

Hirshon makes his point

Candidate encourages voter response during W&L visit

 

By Cathy Lopiccolo
News Editor

 

In his red, white and blue striped
suit and American flag shirt and tie,
Russell Hirshon doesn’t look like
your average candidate for president
of the United States.

During his campaign stop at W&L
last Friday, Hirshon didn’t sound like
a presidential candidate either.

“‘All I ask is that people vote.
I’m not trying to get elected,’’ Hir-
shon said. ‘‘I can’t be elected legal-
ly, and I don’t want to be elected.’’

Hirshon, who is too young to be
elected president, said he is running
to make people and candidates more
responsive to issues. The 31-year-old
Democratic candidate said he doesn’t
even care who people vote for.

*“‘Any candidate can make good
changes, and I think the voters can
make a candidate better,’’ Hirshon
said.

‘‘Bush is going to win, but if our
voter turnout is high, then maybe we
can make Bush more responsive.’
Hirshon said he was willing to do
anything and go anywhere during his
campaign to raise the consciousness
of voters.

“‘T'll put myself in debt. I want to
go completely beserk this once,’’
Hirshon said.

A former bartender with only a
high school education, Hirshon said
he doesn’t read books, but he
watches a lot of television and
movies.

He decided to run for president
after watching Rocky, Dead Poet's

reactions,’’ Hirshon said.

W&L students said they liked
Hirshon’s reasons for running, but
they were glad he wasn’t seriously
persuing the presidency.

‘He was really funny. I respect
his taking the time to run with noth-
ing to gain monetarily or otherwise,”’
junior Jimmy Walsh said. ‘‘But I'd
never vote for him.”’

RR RSE SHAG SE ES. SSA UAC OE ce Ft,
“Bush is going to win, but if our voter tur-
nout is high, then maybe we can make
Bush more responsive.”

Society, and Mr.Smith Goes to
Washington all on the same day.

Hirshon began his political career
as a write-in candidate for mayor of
Washington. As a politician, Hirshon
said he has learned a lot about the
American political system and him-
self.

“‘T think the mayoral race was the
first thing I’ve finished since high
school.’’ Hirshon said. ‘‘Now I know
I can finish things.’’

Hirshon commented on the way
W&L students reacted to him.

“IT had expected some negative

— Russell Hirshon

‘“‘He has a basic grasp of prob-
lems but not of how to solve them,”’
junior Andrew Roper said.

‘If he were really running, he might
take votes away from _ other
Democrats and split the vote,”’ said
Roper. ‘‘But he does put a sense of
humor in the race, and that’s someth-
ing we haven’t had a lot of.’’

W&L students might not have
heard the last of Hirshon. Hirshon
said the Mock Convention staff has
talked to him about appearing on the
Washington, D.C., float in the Mock
Convention parade next March.

Wilde comedy featured at VMI

 

From the VMI News Office

 

Oscar Wilde’s classic Victorian
comedy, The Importance of Being
Earnest, directed by Joellen Bland,
opens Thursday, October 3 at 8 p.m.
at the Virginia Military Institute in
Scott Shipp Hail.

A parody of the most revered
values and ideals of the Victorian era,
this delightful play treats trivial things
seriously with sincere triviality.

Family life, love, marriage, man-
ners, education, literature, business,
politiics and even names are parodied
in Wilde’s cleverly contrived comedy
which opened in London almost 100
years ago.

 

 

 

Heading the cast as Jack Wor-
thington and Algernon Moncrieff, two
fastidious young gentlemen of leisure,
are Cadets J. Michael Morris and
James Cherry, both making their
onstage debuts with the VMI theatre.

A native of Ottawa, Canada,
Gaylard studied with Irene Wood-
burn Wright and later with Ross Pratt

University of Toronto in piano perfor-
mance and pedagogy, and a diploma
from the Mozarteum in Salzburg,

of performances at the Lenfest.

Specialty halls canceled

 

sy Fran Kefalas
staff Reporter

 

The voluntary experiment with specialty
ialls begun in the freshman dorms last year
vill not be tried again.

The decision to discontinue these types
f halls was made by Kenneth Ruscio,
ormer dean of freshmen and residence life.
it was the first time Washington and Lee
ad attempted such a project, and Ruscio
iid he was ‘‘skeptical of these kinds of
lings.”’

However, he did see it as a chance to
bring together people of different back-
rounds who had a common interest.

Ruscio said the very idea of specialty
alls ‘‘clearly went against the fundamental

yproach to freshman residence life’’ that
&L takes, but in this particular case ‘‘the
otential benefits outweighed the approach.

‘‘An awful lot of really good things came
out of the halls," Ruscio said.

Jody Herring, the women’s dorm
counselor for the environmental hall last
year emphasized the positive aspects of
specialty halls.

“Everybody got along great,’’ she said.

But Ruscio and Herring said that the
forum the halls provided for environmentally
conscious freshmen could easily be found
elsewhere.

‘‘Any freshman can get involved in The
Outing Club,’’ Herring said, which is deeply
concemed with the environment.

However, this was not the only reason for
discontinuing specialty halls.

Ruscio said many of the freshmen had
different expectations of what the
environmental hall would be.

“It was hard to convey to freshmen the
objectiveness of the hall,’’ Ruscio said.

Ruscio said he firmly believes that the
freshman year is not the time for a specialty
hall.

‘‘Freshmen don’t have a reference point
to judge whether this would be a good thing

for them or not,’’ Ruscio said.

Herring, who is a dorm counselor again
this year, said she felt it was important ‘‘to
have people with totally different interests
together.’”

Ruscio said he consulted dorm counselors
and students living on the halls at the time
the decision was made to discontinue the
halls.

However, he said the final decision was
completely his own.

Even so, Ruscio said this doesn’t mean
there isn’t a future for specialty halls at
WA&L.

“I think the ideal time for this is with
upperclassmen,’’ Ruscio said.

Dean of Freshmen and Residence Life
Dennis Manning said he believes in
‘integration rather than segregation,’’ but
would not rule out the possibility of future
specialty halls.

“It would depend on the group of stu-
dents’’ and on ‘‘what their endeavor would
be,’’ Manning said.

endous asset to the university.

“IT think it’s great,’’ Knudson
said. ‘‘These kinds of things do a
great deal for W&L. This gives the
campus an aspect of class that we
capitalize on. Nothing begets money
like money,"’ Knudson said.

Faculty members are not the only
ones who question the location of the
new gallery. Senior Ted Eades
thinks university expansion should be
concentrated away from the Hill.

‘We've got the Lenfest Center,”
Eades said. “I’m in favor of them
expanding the art department, but it’s
too crowded up there as it is.”’

Geology Professor Samuel Kozak
expressed his opinion on the loss of
space.

“It’s an open place at the end of ,,
the campus where there are few open
places,’’ Kozak said. res 8

‘There needs to be a little decen-
y, decorum, and a large amount of
maturity,’’said Atkins.

Atkins and Interfraternity Council
President Greg Hicks reminded the
fraternities at Tuesday night’s IFC
neeting that Tear Night can get out
f control with injuries. They said
hose are not the type of activities a
reshman should experience on the
rst night in his fraternity life.

“I don’t want to hear any horror
stories [about injuries] this year,”’
said Hicks.

“(The bidees] are supposed to
de celebrating their first night of their
\dulthood, without their parents,”’

iid Atkins. Instead, he said, police-
ien show up at fraternity houses
seing people acting like they are in
kindergarten, ‘half-naked, beating on
ots.’

Many upperclassmen remember
heir own tear nights.

Junior Jameson Leonardi re-
calls mantle diving, beer slides and a
lot of fun.

‘It’s probably one of the most
‘xciting nights of the year for
‘raternities,’’ said Leonardi.

Senior Bill Benson recalls his tear
night: he was out at the party, a
brother asked him to tear and then
everyone starting to scream, ‘‘Tear,
tear, tear.’’

Then everyone gathered around
him, and he tore off his shirt.
People poured beer and cups on him,
and soon he was up on someone’s
shoulders.

Benson also provides freshgnen
with some advice about tearing.

‘Don’t let anyone make your
decision for you, think over your
decision before the party,’’ said Ben-
son. ‘‘And if you don’t intend to tear
on Friday, don’t drink a lot.

Sometimes bidees tear at a house
where they did not desire member-
ship, he said.

One junior also provides a bit of
advice that he needed his freshman
year.

‘Don’t wear white boxers because
they cling,’’ he said.

Juniors P.J. Waicus and Fred
Haring suggest tearing between
midnight and 1 a.m.

‘‘Wait until there’s a lot of people
at the party before you tear,’’ said
Haring. He also reminds bidees that
the women at the parties always
notice the men who tear.

“IT had at least ten girls call me
the next day,’’ said Haring.

Freshman Roland Chase from
Idstein, said he’s Germany has heard
lots advice on what to expect this
weekend.

“I’ve heard to wear old clothes.
A girl said [the brothers] will
throw me down the stairs. If that is
what it’s like, fine,’’ said Chase.

One female counsels freshmen
men to try to stay in control and
remember what they’re doing at all
times.

‘Don’t ask someone to Foxfield
and then forget,’’ said the once-jilted
junior.

New weight room rules

 

From Staff Reports

The Washington and Lee Athletic
Department has administered a new
Policy for the weight rooms in both
Gaines Hall and the Doremus Gym-
nasium.

“The Athletic Department formed
a committee to evaluate both the
Gaines and Doremus weight rooms,’’
said Jim Stagnitta, who is in charge
of maintaining the weight rooms with
Gavin Colliton. ‘‘We evaluated the e-
quipment and the rules and regula-
tions to try to make them cleaner,
better organized areas. We wanted to
bring it up to Division III standards
both for students and athletes.’

The main area of adjustments
came through immediate changes.
There were minor changes in the
rules and supervision goveming the
weight room.

‘*The changes are minor,’’ Stag-
nitta said, ‘‘but we need cooperation
from everyone who uses the equip-
ment so the supervisors or work
studies aren’t put in awkward posi-
tions.’’

Most of the time, work study
students will be supervising the use
of the weights. ‘‘The work studies
are there to supervise, help people
with their training and to keep the
room clean. But they are not there to
clean up after others,’’ Stagnitta
stressed.

The new rules are as follows:

eShirts and athletic shoes must be
worn. (No sandals or flip-flops, etc.)

*No food or drinks allowed in the
room. Squirt bottles only.

eNo tobacco.

eBreak down weights and retumn
them to the racks after using them.

Those who don’t comply with
rules or suggestions from the super-
visors can lose their weight room
privileges.

Any problems or concerns can be
brought to either Stagnitta (463-
8678) or Colliton (463-8682).

out starters Reid Murphy and Greg
Williams as they served one game
suspensions for red cards.

Even without two offensive play-
ers, the Generals dominated this game
in terms of scoring opportunities, but
they still came away with only one
goal.

“The team did a great job of
creating opportunities, but they just
weren’t finishing them. It’s both a
mental and technical problem,’’ said
head coach Rolf Piranian about Fri-
day’s game.

The Generals took an early 1-0
lead when junior Kyle Fanning scored
off an assist from Mitchem. Carnegie
Mellon responded later with a goal
set up by their third corner kick of
the first half.

The real hero of Friday’s tie was
senior goalkeeper Lee Corbin. Corbin
made six saves, with the most impor-
tant one being on a one-on-one
breakaway with eight seconds to go
in regulation.

On Sunday against Johns Hopkins,
the Generals had Murphy and Wil-
liams back, but Mitchem was out
with his injury. Even without Mit-
chem, W&L came out flying. They

took the lead 1-0 on an individual
effort by Reid Murphy to keep con-
trol of the ball and get off the scor-
ing shot.

The game-clincher came a few
minutes later as freshman forward
Sam Drennan took a pass from class-
mate Britt Seal and put it past the
Johns Hopkins goalkeeper for a 2-0
lead.

JHU’s only goal came late in the
first half on a giveaway by the Gen-
erals in their own end.

‘‘We’re playing better, but we
could play even better,’ said Piranian
of the weekend. ‘‘We have to elim-
inate dangerous decisions, which
could have cost us both games.’

‘‘Our best soccer was the first 20
minutes of the first half in both
games,’’ said senior tri-captain David
Hooker. ‘‘The team let down after
the first goals. The defense was
good — good coverage and good
communication. But we need more
cohesiveness with the forwards.’’

Murphy explained why the for-
wards haven’t clicked yet. ‘We
haven’t played with our best 11 play-
ers, yet. Greg [Williams] and I were
out Friday, and then Mike [Mitchem]

was out Sunday. We haven't been
able to establish solid communication.
This also hurts because we haven't
been able to be more creative —
we've been just creative enough to
win.”’

In late action yesterday, the Gen-
erals opened their 1991 Old Dom-
inion Athletic Conference season with
a 2-0 win over Guilford.

Murphy opened the scoring with

a penalty kick midway through the
first half. The goal was Murphy’s
team-leading third of the season.
Sophomore Dan Rhodes added the
second goal off a feed from freshman
Eric Tracy. Corbin made four saves
to record his first shutout of the sea-
son.
The Generals’ record now stands
at 3-0-2, 1-0-0 in ODAC play. It is
the team’s best start since the 1964
season when the Generals went 6-0-
0 to open the season.

W&L’s next game will be Satur-
day at Bethany. The team’s next
home game will follow the Bethany
game on Tuesday in another ODAC
contest against Hampden-Sydney at
4:00 p.m.

day against Old Dominion Athletic
Conference opponent Randolph-Macon
Women’s College to try and get their
offense back on track.

Going into the game, Hathorn was
cautiously optimistic about her team’s
chances for a win.

‘*Because of Saturday’s game, we
want to come back and win, but
thinking that it’s going to be an easy
game is an easy trap to fall into,’
she said before the game.

   

‘*You can be the best team on the
field and still lose the game. We
need to prepare for a nameless, face-
less team and just assume that it’s
going to be a tough game.”’

The Generals took Hathorn’s

wariness into consideration. W&L
won the game 10-0, setting a school-
record for goals.

Sophomore Karen Stutzmann led
the offensive outburst, scoring three
times. Hankins added two, and Jeffer-

son had a goal and two assists. uve..
goalie Kate Stimeling got into the
act.

Out of the goal in the second
half, Stimeling scored a goal and
added an assist to cap the shutout
win. W&L out-shot R-MWC 46-3 on
the afternoon.

Next challenger for the Generals,
2-2, 2-1 in the ODAC, will be at
Guilford Saturday.

Volleyball
spikes MBC
in easy win

By Rob Robinson
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Washington and Lee vol-
leyball team opened its Old Dominion
Athletic Conference season with a
convincing win over Mary Baldwin
College Tuesday night.

The Generals took control early
and beat MBC in three straight
games, 15-3, 15-4, 15-11.

Senior outside hitter Mena Mc-
Gowin led the team with nine kills as
W&L improved to 5-7 and 1-0 in
ODAC play. Junior setter B.J. League
had seven assists and freshman Mich-
ele Ralston added six. Senior Marcy
Brown led the way with eight digs.

**We’re looking forward to many
more ODAC wins this year,’’ said
junior Leslie Hess, who added seven
digs.

Hess attributed the win to strong
practices and team unity.

Over the weekend, W&L hosted
its first ever tournament and finished
with a 2-3 record. McGowin had 32
kills in the tournament, and Hess
added 20. Ralston had 79 assists in
the tournament. W&L got its wins
against Meredith and Goucher and
extended both finalists. W&L took
runner-up Washington and Jefferson
to three games and lost a 16-14 game
to Carnegie Mellon.

The Generals will next play in a
tournament at Maryville College this
weekend.

 

Wa&L’s tennis
tournaments

From Staff Reports

 

 

The Washington and Lee
women’s tennis team opened its
1991-92 season with a strong
showing in the W&L Fall Tourna-
ment.

The Generals won two of
three matches, falling only to
Swarthmore 5-4 in the first match
of the tournament. W&L bounced
back to top Sweet Briar 7-2 and
Methodist 3-1. Sophomore Genia
Foster was a perfect 3-0 at No. 1
singles for W&L. W&L also got
a lift from freshman Marilyn
Baker, who went 3-0 at No. 3
singles and 3-0 at No. 3 doubles.
She teamed with senior Brannon
Aden and freshman Elizabeth
McCord in doubles.

The W&L men’s team will
open its season this weekend,
hosting the Rolex South Atlantic
Regional. The winner of the tour-
nament will advance to the na-
tional tournament on Nov. 1-3 in
Corpus Christi, Tex. W&L’s top
players are sophomore Rob Mac-
Naughton, last year’s NCAA
Freshman of the Year, senior
Rich Yates and sophomore Robert

 

Wein.

Polo drops three at Navy

 

By Andrew Fox
Staff Reporter

 

After an inconsistent start of the
1991 season, the Washington and Lee
water polo team is poised to return to
its mid-season form of a year ago.

After a convincing 14-5 victory
over Villanova in the first round of
the EWPA Varsity Invitational, the
Generals dropped their final three
matches to polo stalwarts Army,
Richmond (9-7), and Boston College.
Inconsistent play in each of the three
losses doomed the Generals’ chances
of bringing home the EWPA crown.

According to senior All-American
Will Davis, the team must play up to
its potential if it wants to experience
the success it achieved last year.

“‘At times we played well,’’ he
said. ‘‘However, we could not put
together a compiete game, especially
against Boston College.’’

For three of the four quarters the
Generals played the Golden Eagles
even, but let the match slip away in
the second quarter in the 9-4 loss.

Davis led the Generals in scoring
with eight goals, four assists and

seven steals. Sophomore Greg Golub
added six goals in the tournament,
and senior Alan Herrick added five.

Sophomore goalie P.J. Waicus re-
corded 35 saves in the tournament,
including 13 against Villanova. Davis
and Golub each scored four goals
against Villanova.

Both Davis and senior Stu Towns
agreed that the EWPA Invitational
showed the players what areas they
need to improve to be prepared for
the remainder of the season.

Said Towns, ‘‘We know what we
have to work on to become more
competitive. | am confident that we
will be ready to successfully face the
strength of our schedule in October
and November.”’

This weekend the Generals host
the Virginia State Championships.
Though arch-rival Richmond is not in
the field, W&L still faces a tough
task to win the tournament. Virginia
Tech, James Madison, Hampden-Syd-
ney, and Lynchburg form the field.

The Generals will play three
matches on Saturday followed by the
championship game on Sunday at
noon.

Cross country falls at
MWC to open season

 

By Jacob Kimball
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee women’s
cross country team gained some re-
spect in last Saturday’s meet with
Mary Washington College and also
emerged with an optimistic view of
the season ahead.

The Generals entered the contest
having never before placing a runner
in the top five against a MWC team
at full strength. Freshman Kim Herr-
ing took care of that.

In her first college meet, Herring
gave an astounding performance that
resulted in a third place overall finish
with a time of 20:04.5. Although the
team went down in defeat, there were
plenty of reasons for head coach Jim
Phemister to be pleased with the
Generals’ effort.

Kim Herring’s feat capped an
afternoon that saw the emergence of
a stellar freshman class. The second
and third place finishers were fresh-
men Teresa Lamey, with a time of
22:04.9, and Sue Deutsch, 22:32.9.

SERVICITAR.

The top freshman runners also in-
cluded Brandi Henderson who ran
well in her first ever cross country
meet.

Rounding out the W&L top five
were senior Jodi Herring, Kim’s older
sister, and Nicole Casteel with times
of 22:33.6 and 23:02.1, respectively.
Both runners return from last year’s
ODAC title team and showed Satur-
day that they are going to make
substantial contributions in W&L’s
quest to retain the title.

Another applaudable performance
was turned in by sophomore Kari
May. Her sixth place finish showed
that her work ethic continues to pay
off as she once again improves her
previous time, Phemister said. She
has run every college meet faster than
the one before.

Bolstered by the return of proven
competitors off last season’s team,
and a bevy of young talent, the team
should improve as the group meshes.
The array of accomplishments shown
in the opening meet bode well as this
group takes on the task of repeating ©
as ODAC champions.

For over three quarters on Satur-
day, the undermanned, undersized
Washington and Lee football team
kept the bigger, stronger and faster
Alabama-Birmingham Blazers at bay.

But in the fourth quarter, the size,
strength and speed took its toll on the
Generals. UAB exploded for 22
points in the fourth quarter to earn its
first ever NCAA win, 34-21.

“They were good athletes,’’ said
W&L head coach Gary Fallon. ‘‘You
can’t allow good, young athletes to
get momentum, and that’s what hap-
pened. They were much quicker and
more mobile, even with their size,
than we thought.’’

UAB’s quickness showed most on
defense, where they sacked W&L
quarterback Fred Renneker 10 times,
and at wide receiver, where Manuel
Philpott ran past the W&L secondary
for touchdowns of 32 and 30 yards.
Running back Pat Green also scored
twice while running for 113 yards on
25 carries.

‘Green is as fine a running back
as I hope we’ll see all year,’’ Fallon
said. ‘‘Their quarterback did what he
had to do to sting us.’’

Doug Gann keyed the air-attack
for the Blazers, completing 17 of 27
passes for 214 yards.

W&L took an early 7-0 lead when
junior Wade Robinett scored on a
two-yard run early in the second

quarter. It was W&L’s first score of

Philpott’s first score gave UAB a
12-7 lead, but W&L scored again
with five seconds left in the first half
to take a 14-12 lead at halftime.
Renneker engineered a five play, 61-
yard drive capped by a five-yard pass
to sophomore Wilson Moore for the
score. On the drive, Renneker hit
senior Jeff Kreis twice for gains of
29 and 26.

W&L got possession when fresh-
man cornerback Jon Wagner caused a
fumble at the W&L 39-yard line.

W&L extended the lead to 21-12
when Renneker hit Robinett with a
14 yard strike for a touchdown mid-
way through the third quarter. W&L
got possession of the ball after junior
Phil Spears recovered a UAB fumble.

UAB scored in the fourth quarter
on Philpott’s 30-yard touchdown
reception, a 10-yard run by Green,
and a 17-yard interception return by
Kevin Holden.

‘‘We scored some points,’’ said
Fallon. ‘‘We made some gains on
their mistakes, but we didn’t make
enough.”’

On the afternoon, Renneker com-
pleted 16 of 38 passes for 178 yards
and two touchdowns. Where the
Generals lost ground, though, was on
the ground. Through the 10 sacks, the
Generals ended up with a school-
record low of -37 yards rushing.

Defensively, W&L made some
mistakes in the secondary, but Fallon
was still pleased.

needs to play
wees than it perry ** Fallon said. ‘‘But
otherwise, John McCallum is playing
like an All-American. And Wagner
was a pleasant surprise.’’

McCallum, a senior defensive end,
made 12 tackles and registered a sack
for his second strong outing in a row.
Wagner made six tackles, caused a
fumble and broke up two passes
before breaking an arm.

“It was a physical game,’ Fallon
said. ‘‘They gang tackled and came
at us with reckless abandon, and it
took its toll. We lost a couple of
good players.’’

Along with Wagner, junior offen-
sive lineman Sean Gatewood damaged
a knee. He was replaced by senior
Steve Fugitte, who played well, said
Fallon, along with the other offensive
line players, despite the sacks.

“I can’t find fault with our ef-
fort,’’ Fallon said, ‘‘and that’s the
first thing we look at on the film.
We weren't discouraged with either
side of the ball. The mistakes we
made were correctable ones. I can see
us getting better each time out.’’

Next up for the Generals is
Centre College. Centre features one
of the best running backs in Division
Ill, Tim McDaniel. McDaniel was a

first-team All-American last year. _

Both teams are 0-2, and Fallon says
this game should resemble every
other game W&L has played against
Centre, a war.

“It’s going to be a real slugfest,
and we better be ready.”’

Women’s soccer dumps R-MWC

The Washington and Lee women’s
soccer team lost a game on dumb
luck on Saturday, and took its frustra-

two games last week.

Virginia Wesleyan scored in the
game’s first five minutes and then
held on to top W&L 1-0 at Liberty

“It was a tough game to lose,”’
said head coach Janine Hathom.
‘*We outplayed them in almost every
category but the score, and that was
the critical category.’’

Senior Morgan Warmer, soph-
omore Corinda Hankins and freshman
Amy Jefferson all caught Hathorn’s
eye with their effort. ‘‘They all had
really good games,’’ she said.

there played well. The people off the
bench carried more than their share

game.’’

Hathorn and the Generals consider
this game a learning experience. “It
was a really good game, but a hard
way to leam a big lesson about fin-
ishing the ball," she said.

Cross country falls as

Eagles nip

By Jacob Kimball
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee men’s
cross country team got off on the
right foot for the 1991 season with
an impressive showing in a show-
down with powerhouse Mary Wash-
ington College last Saturday.

The Generals, in their first meet of
the season, gave last year’s South-
eastern Regional Champions a scare
as they captured the top two places.
Co-captains Bo Hannah and Charles
Edwards led the charge as they cap-
tured first and second, respectively.
The W&L twosome ran neck and
neck with each other as Hannah's
time of 27:09.3 just bested Edwards’
27:09.6.

Both ran away from the pack. The
next finisher was a lengthy eighteen
seconds behind. Both runners are
coming off strong seasons and left
head coach John Tucker the impres-
sion that they are both ready and
willing to shoulder the attack as the
Generals vie for the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference title.

With Hannah and Edwards leading
the way, the Generals closed the gap
between themselves and the Eagles.
Last year, MWC won by 13 points.
This year, though, the Generals
closed the gap to nine points, losing
25-34.

Tucker noted that this year’s total
of seventy-five miles of running per
week is a considerably more am-

Generals

bitious training schedule than the
teams of the seasons past had en-
dured. This rigorous workload was
reflected in the team’s showing at
their first meet and Coach Tucker is
glad to see that it is ‘‘paying off.”

The freshmen runners, led by
Matthew Brock, showed by their
performances Saturday that they will
be instrumental as the team prepares
to challenge for this year’s ODAC
title. Brock, who finished eighth
overall, was W&L’s third place fin-
isher with a time of 28:13. Based on
his first collegiate meet, Coach Tuck-
er expects him to be ‘‘up with our
top runners’’ as the season progres-
ses.

Tucker said another name to rem-
ember is freshman Doug Boyles who
registered a respectable time of 29:52,
placing him seventh for W&L.

Rounding out the top five finishers
were returning lettermen Lee Parker,
another co-captain, and Keith Rinn
with times of 28:56 and 29:15
respectively. These two join Hannah
and Edwards in forming a solid core
of returners whose experience will be
heavily relied upon as the Generals
make their way up to Carlisle, Pa.,
for the upcoming Dickinson Invita-
tional on Saturday, September 28.

Tucker says his team will be
ready. ‘‘We will be competitive.”’
The invitational consists of several
strong teams, among them Mary
Washington.
