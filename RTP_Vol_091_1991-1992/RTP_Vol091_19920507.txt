SAN JOSE, Costa Rica --- Just south of
civil-war torn Nicaragua and northwest of po-
litically volatile Panama, between Pacific and
Caribbean coasts where lush green jungle cloaks

 

lies a political oasis, anation seated on a moun-
tain chain jutting from the sea, a home to some
3 million people governed not by a dictator,
and not by a crown, but by their peers.

Costa Rica boasts a shirt-sleeve democ-

beer.

At sodas, or cafes, politics dominates popu-
lar conversation, at least among the older clien-
tele. Legend has it that the last revolution, in
1948, was planned at the Soda Palace, a single,
large, high-ceilinged room just off the street in
downtown San Jose, where still today, mostly
men sit a formica tables scattered across a
concrete floor and drink Costa Rican coffee,

The people here are generally happy, or so
they will say, even though most make do with
far fewer material conveniences than most
Americans, and far more repetition in their
meals: a lot of rice and beans.

Costa Ricans live in the shadow of the
First World. The best movies and t.v. shows are
in English, either subtitled or dubbed. The best
music is sung in English, and the best videos
are on MTV. The best clothes are “Made in the
U.S.A.”; they are also the most expensive.
Costa Ricans learn early that knowing English
is a prerequisite for affluence.

Nevertheless, Costa Ricans, or Ticos, are
intensely proud of their country. They were
saddened by the race violence that followed the
Rodney King trial in the United States, and
newspaper editorials here called on the United
States to look south for an example --- to Costa
Rica, where by necessity of space and re-

prevails.

When Tico columnists write about Costa
Rica, they usually begin with some statement
like, “If we want our country to remain great.”
The Costa Ricans, unlike their U.S. neighbors,
seem secure in their national identity.

But if you ask the Tico if he is happy with
his government, the answer is often a reluctant
“no.” Reluctant, perhaps, so as not to give the
impression that he is not proud to be Costa
Rican, but “no” because, well, one need only
look around.

In a country famed for its bureaucracy,

Alumni
return...

By JOSHUA MANNING
Phi Managing Editor

More than 650 alumni will return to Lexington
this evening for a weekend of activities including the
long-awaited unveiling of Old George.

There are fewer alumni returning this year than
last, but Assistant Director of Alumni Programs
Robert Mish, attributes that to both smaller classes
and the economy.

“They do pay a reunion fee tocome back,” Mish
said. “But that’s just a drop in the bucket with what
they might have to pay for plane fare.”

This weekend’s festivities will feature the class
of 1942, celebrating its 50th anniversary, and the
class of 1967, celebrating its 25th.

 

Mish said the most part of the week-
end will be watching and being with the 57 members
returning from the class of '42.

“They really are the stars of the weekend,” Mish
said. “In fall of their senior year they had Pearl
Harbor, and upon graduation they all went into the
war. The weekend will revolve around that theme.”

For the first time, Alumni Weekend will feature
| amiemorial service Friday morning, in honor of the

IL.

‘Following the service, a special lecture by Pro-
fessor Barry Machado on “The Irony of World War
II” will be held for the new Five-Star Generals, The
lecture will be specifically designed to replicate the
feel of a W&L class in the 1940s, It will be held in
Robinson 6, a classroom that has not changed much
over the past 50 years.

A series of reunion seminars will be held all day
Friday, including a special discussion on Vietnam
requested by the class of '67.

“Like the class of ’42, the class of ’67 wentright
out of here to war,” Mish said. “But their situation
was very, very different.”

The seminar panelists, which will include sev-
eral Vietnam veterans and a conscientious objector,
will address the topic “Vietnam: An Oral History” at
2:45 p.m. Friday in Commerce School 327.

After a two-year absence, Old George will be
unveiled Friday evening in a ceremony on the front
lawn.

At 8:30 p.m., the Lee Chapel bells will ring,

By Amy YARCICH
Phi Staff Reporter

The unveiling of Old George this Friday
evening amidst a three-minute fireworks display
will coincide with the return of over 650 alumni
and their families.

“We thought alumni weekend was a time
when both alumni and students could j participate
in the ceremony,” said Director of Communica-
tions Brian Shaw.

The ceremony, which begins at 8:30 onthe
lawn in front of Washington Hall, will feature
various speakers as well as entertainment from
the Johnny McClenon Big Band.

University President John D. Wilson will
make the opening remarks followed by a few
words from Branko Medenica, the Birmingham,
Ala. sculptor who restored Old George.

James Whitehead and John Warner, '40, the
two men primarily responsible for the restora-
tion of Old George, will also speak.

Shaw said Warner proposed Medenica as
the sculptor for the project and also helped se-
cure funding for the restoration.

Whitehead, who has been the Director of the
Reeves Center for the past ten years, “oversaw
the project and was the force behind it,” Shaw
said.

The original wooden statue of George Wash-
ington was carved from a piece of driftwood in
1840 at a cost of $100.

The statue sat on top of Washington Hall
until two years ago when it was removed to be
renovated.

The original Old George will be on display
Friday in the University Library's Boatwright
Room.

By FRANCESCA KEFALAS

First-year law student Chris
Kowalczuk is appealing to the Virgin-
ia Supreme Court for the right to vote
in Virginia, after being rejected by
officials in Lexington three times.

Last Thursday, 25th Circuit Court
Judge Rudolph Bumgardner III up-
held Lexington Registrar Lucille
Joyce’s two refusals of Kowalczuk’s
voter registration applications.

Bumgardner's decision confirms
Joyce’s judgment that Kowalczuk is
not domiciled in Lexington
and thus cannot vote here.

Kowalczuk expects the
Supreme Court to be more
receptive than Lexington of-
ficials have been.

“This is a local issue
and there has been such an
aversion to studetns voting
for such a long time. Once
you're out from under that
kind of ‘pervasive attitude ...,”
Kowalczuk trailed off.

When Kowalczuk first tried to
register in March, Joyce rejected his
application because he listed Ohio, as
his permanent address. Two days later
he returned and declared his intent to
make Lexington his permanent home.

But Joyce maintained that Lex-
ington is not Kowalczuk’s domicile.

“T asked what had changed in two
days, and [Kowalczuk] said he had
changed his mind,” Joyce said. “I said,
‘Changing your mind doesn’t neces-
sarily change your domicile.’ ”

Additionally, Kowalczuk had not
paid state taxes or registered his car in
Virginia, two of the actions that would
show that he wanted to make Lexing-
ton his domicile, Joyce said.

Kowalczuk has said that Joyce
was correct in refusing to register him
the first time — when he listed Ohio as
his permanent address.

 

 

Jackson

But he argues that since then he
has stated his intent to make Lexington
his domicile. He said he is financially
independent, has a Virginia driver’s
license and last lived in Ohio in 1980.

“Everything I own is in Lexing-
ton,” he said. “When I leave Lexington
inthe summer, it’s for visiting people.”

One thing that puzzles Kowalczuk
about the controversy, he said, is that
Joyce allowed sophomores Matt Jack-
son and Ryan Dennard to register.

“Their situation is far more tenu-
ous than mine,” Kowalczuk said. He
said Jackson still lives in Pennsylva-
niaandhis parents claim him
as a tax deduction.

“Tf I’m not eligible
to vote, there’s no way in
hell that Matt Jackson is,”
Kowalczuk said.

Originally, Jackson
and Kowalczuk applied to-
gether. Like Kowalczuk,
Jackson listed his parents’
home as his domicile.

But when Jackson and Dennard
tried to register the second time, Joyce
said, Jackson told her that he misun-
derstood what she had asked him the
first time he applied. The sophomores
gave her a letter explaining why they
wanted to make Lexington their home
and detailing ties they have to the city.

“{Jackson] didn’t know exactly
what he was doing [the first time],”
Joyce said. “Mr. K [Kowalczuk] in-
structed Mr. Jackson, and this little
second-year [Jackson] followed him."

But Kowalczuk should have
known what he was doing the first
time he tried to register, Joyce said.

“T thought that anyone who was
just about finished with his first year of
law school would know what ‘domi-
cile’ means,” she said.

Kowalczuk said he expects the
state Supreme Court to hear his case
this summer.

“It is far from over.”

Five Washington and Lee students
have been forced to withdraw so far
this year after being found guilty of
honor violations.

The violations stemmed from 21
honor violation investigations and 10
closed hearings as of May 4, according
to figures from the Executive Com-
mittee.

EC President Giles Perkins, Sec-
retary Caroline Wight and Third- Year
Law Representative Jeff Kelsey said
there have been more investigations
this year than in the past, but the num-
ber of closed hearings and guilty ver-
dicts is about average.

Perkins said the EC has averaged
three or four convictions over the last
10 years.

Both Perkins and Kelsey said the
1990-91 year was abnormal with just
two closed trials ending in guilty ver-
dicts.

“The number of investigations
[this year] is real indicative of how
well the system works,” Perkins said.

Both Wight and Perkins said there
was abacklog of investigations in Janu-
ary, some of which were holdovers
from fall-term exams.

“Usually around exam time is
when you'll see someone looking off
into space, and wonder if they are
committing an honor violation,” Wight
said.

gestion last year at this time due to
winter-term exams.

Suspected violations reported dur-
ing spring-term exams will be tried the
following fall in the case of under-
classmen, and before graduation in the
case of seniors, Perkins said.

Forking and Wight said most of

Z the cases this year
have been re-
ported by stu-
dents, but Wight
said there is usu-
ally a professor
involved.

Perkins
said Lexington
community mem-
bers have also re-
ported suspected honor violations.

“T think it’s good — it shows
people outside the school respect the
system,”said Perkins.

Perkins said respect for the honor
system within the school comes and
goes.

“T’ve had indications that the fresh-
man class takes it [the honor system]
very seriously,” Perkins said. “It’s
much harder to convince the law stu-
dents to take it seriously.”

According to Perkins, the current
EC’s interpretation of the White Book
has been neither loose nor strict.

University President John Wilson welcomes senior Ellen Lewis to Lee House for
his annual cocktail party. Seniors ate, drank and made merry with Wilson
Monday and Tuesday nights in celebration of their approaching graduation.

 

 

Faculty members delayed making a decision on whether
to revise Washington and Lee’s student judicial system
Monday.

Professor of Politics Lewis John said the faculty de-
layed the decision on a Student Affairs Committee proposal
that would kill the controversial Confidential Review Com-
mittee because the issue was too complex for the them to
handle in one meeting.

“There wasn’t time to resolve all the different issues
that came up,” John said.

University President John Wilson called a special
faculty meeting for Tuesday and said that he hoped the
faculty would settle the issue then, according to John.

The SAC proposal would eliminate the CRC and
replace it with a Student-Faculty Hearing Board to hear
cases of physical sexual misconduct.

Cases of racial or religious slurs would first be handled
by a mediator with final authority given to the Student
Conduct Committee if the mediation process failed.

John said criticism of the SAC proposal came from
faculty with a variety of opinions, including some who felt
the proposal did not go far enough to protect a student’s
right to free speech.

Other faculty members expressed support for the revi-
sions proposed by the CRC in its self-evaluation study
released in March, John said.

In its extreme, that proposal said that students could be
expelled by the CRC for calling someone ugly or using
racist language.

John said that despite the hope of settling the issue
Tuesday, it is possible that a decision could be delayed until
next fall.

The menacing issue of the Confidential Review

from page one, the CRC’s future was NOT decided Mon-

faculty stalled the process once again.

Was it William F. Buckley who said he would rather be
governed by the first 100 names in the Manhattan telephone
directory than by the faculty of Harvard University? Perhaps
we can say the same about our governing faculty — if they
ever decide to govern.

During the recent debate on adding an additional student
to the Student Affairs Committee, Professor Kathy
Koberstein said that students should not be ‘‘burdened’’ with
majority representation on SAC because we are not capable
of making decisions on sensitive issues. Yet now it’s the
faculty that seems unable to make such decisions.

We are very disappointed in our faculty. Not only have
many of them proven that they have lost touch with the
student body, but this most recent failure shows that either
they are hopelessly divided on the issue, or are pleased
enough with the status quo to avoid making the difficult
decisions. Either way, like a courtroom jury, they must
continue until the decisions are made.

No one ever said the job of enlightening the minds of
2,000 young men and women is easy. We understand it’s
difficult. But we think this decision should be a easier than
most. After all, the choice is between a system that works
against enlightening minds and causes nothing but dissention
among all involved, and one that might cure this problem.

While we would certainly prefer a system without any
regulations on speech, one that is sustained by the ‘“‘decency
and civility’? within each of us as W&L students, we
recognize SAC’s efforts in hammering out a compromise.
It’s a compromise that makes a change for the better. A
system dealing with physical harassment (the Faculty-
Student Hearing Board), but leaving all speech matters to
ultimate student control (the Student Conduct Committee).

President Wilson has called the faculty into special
session Tuesday, and he has the authority to continue calling
special session faculty meetings — daily, if necessary —
until this issue is resolved. We urge him to continue to do
so until the faculty has made a decision. Do not allow this
albatross to remain around our necks until next fall.

Consider real life

As you probably know (or should know), a California
jury last week acquitted four Los Angeles police officers
of charges of brutality in the beating of Rodney King. As
we hope you also know, Los Angeles and other major
cities erupted into blood and chaos as citizens protested
what they viewed as a travesty of justice by a racist jury.

And in Lexington? Students frolicked in the Maury,
studied a little, drank a lot and enjoyed spring term.

Our point isn’t that students should have protested the
verdict by setting fires or stealing a few TV sets. And
we’re not trying to argue for or against the verdict. But in
a place where we’re supposed to be preparing for the Real
World, we think about reality far too rarely.

As W&L students, we are told from the moment we
set foot on campus that we are the ‘‘cream of the crop”’
and America’s future leaders. Invariably, however,
students — like the rest of the world — end up focused
upon their own immediate situations. And because life at
W&L is in many ways so idyllic and secluded, the
problems of the Real World often pass us by. We forget
about the America out there that we are supposed to one
day be leading into — and through — the future.

America needs leadership, someone’s leadership; that’s
obvious. W&L likes to say that its students can provide
that leadership. And we wholeheartedly believe that. But
unless W&L students make the effort — and in our
pleasant environment it is an effort — to plug ourselves
into the outside world, then each year commencement will
only release into the world 400 educated but
fundamentally ignorant future leaders. And that’s hardly
what this country needs.

My VIEw

and R. Scott Bell, '91

 

A tradition died at Washington
and Lee this spring, and we fear that its
passing is final and irrevocable. There-
fore, we are writing to give the Wash-
ington and Lee Men’s Glee Club a
proper obituary.

It is necessary to start off by not-
ing our admiration for and our loyalty
to, Dr. Gordon Spice (“Doc”), the head
of the music department. We do not
intend our remarks to be an attack that
calls into question Doc’s professional
capabilities or his personal attributes;
we consider him a good friend and an
outstanding instructor. However, we
do strongly disagree with his decision
to disband the Glee Club. We under-
stand that this year’s Glee Club per-
haps, at times, didn’t produce the same
quality of music that had become the
groups’s trademark. Neither of us
wants to see the Glee Club become a
mediocre group, but we are disturbed
by what we perceive as nary a struggle
to preserve what was, only two years
ago, a vibrant and talented singing
group. Maybe the group needed a bit
of surgery, but it didn’t need to be
killed.

The first explanation for the dis-
banding of the Glee Club is that the
music department didn’t have the nec-

- essary resources to adequately support

its myriad of singing groups. If this is
true, then we think that some of the
blame should be directed toward Wash-
ington Hall; this grave error might
have been avoided with the hiring of,
at the very least, a part-time musical

instructor. (Please note that our opin-
ions about the staffing of the music
department are ours alone; our state-
ments have not been encouraged by
any faculty member.) A case in point -
-- during the 1989-90 school year ---
“Doc” was doing his best imperson-
ation of Superman. Besides fulfilling
his duties as head of the music depart-
ment, he was conducting both the Glee

were no longer getting students who
were interested in singing in an all-
male group. If this is the true, then we
again note that this does not reflect any
personal agenda by “Doc” --- he is
passionate about the sound of an all-
male group, and he enjoyed his time
with the Glee Club. However, we do
think the demise of the Glee Club can
be attributed to the decision to make

resources were quite strained.

However, if the current budget-
ary reality is that the music department
couldn’tadequately support all its sing-
ing groups, then the Glee Club should
have been the last group before the
firing squad. After decades of produc-
ing damn good music and represent-
ing Washington and Lee as it toured
the East Coast, we think that the Glee
Club deserved special consideration.
Was the solution the cancellation of
the Glee Club, the oldest singing group
on campus, and the creation of another
mixed singing ensemble? Couldn’t the
Glee Club and the University Chorus
have been the two main groups on
campus?

The second explanation for the
demise of the Glee Club is that they

A decision was made that the Univer-
sity Chorus would become the touring
chorus at Washington and Lee, and
that it would represent our school
abroad and in its own series of con-
certs. Therefore, an effort was made to
attract the best talent to this group. The
Glee Club became the odd-man out,
and we believe that the available male
singers received the impression that
the Glee Club was no longer a unique
organization that represented our uni-
versity.

Some have suggested that the de-
cision to emphasize a mixed singing
group which directly contributed to
the death of the Glee Club, was afunc-
tion of co-education. We disagree. We
are both avid supporters of co-educa-
tion at Washington and Lee, but we do

&L's oldest singing group

think that some traditions of the “old”
Washington and Lee have a rightful
place in university life. The Glee Club
was one of those traditions. Co-educa-
tion didn’t bring about the destruction
of fraternities, but instead the univer-
sity made a concerted effort to save
them via Fraternity Renaissance. If our
university could spend millions and
millions of dollars to preserve one
unique aspect of the “old” Washington
and Lee, then couldn’t the administra-
tion have allotted funds for an addi-
tional faculty member in the music
department? And couldn’t Washing-
ton and Lee allow the Glee Club its
earned and deserved spot as a repre-

_ Sentative of our school? Not only was

the group a wonderful ambassador to
other schools via our touring, but count-
less life-long friendships were spawned
during practices, tours and joint con-
certs with other schools,

The Glee Club is gone; we fear
that no amount of alumni outrage and
protest will result in Lazarus-like
miracle. Therefore, in closing, we urge
the music department to cease their
alumni Glee Club concert. During our
four years at Washington and Lee, we
were involved in those concerts and
enjoyed them immensely. However,
we feel that the alumni concerts served
primarily to link the past members of
the Glee Club with a current Glee Club
that was alive and well. Since the stu-
dents and faculty have decided that the
Glee Club no longer has a place at our
institution, then let the group rest in
peace. If this year the alumni Glee
Club does perform, then please bill it
as the final concert of the organization
--- the group at least deserves a proper
and public funeral.

Sex confuses Swann

 

Let It RIDE

By Chris Swan

 

My roommate is watching Everything You
Wanted To Know About Sex, But Were Afraid To Ask,
another one of those movies that should have been on
my list in the last cloumn. I don’t know if you’ve seen
it, but Ienjoy the last scene the most. In it, the brain is
ordering various organs to perform their duties ---
Tony Randall from The Odd Couple is Mission Con-
trol, Burt Reynolds the Operator, and the various
organ groups such as Stomach, Eyes, Ears, and...
ahem... Privates are doing their best to function prop-
erly. It sounded like the bridge of a submarine: Dive,
Dive, Dive! Blow all tanks!

Woody Allen as the paranoid sperm is classic.
He doesn’t trust what the slides in Sperm class told
him about ovum and eggs; he wonders what’s out in
the dark void and fears it. His earlier fears about
“ending up on the ceiling” are replaced by, “What if
I get lost?” or moralizing over the appropriateness of
doing this to this girl at this particular time. With Tony
Randall screaming for Memory to start listing base-
ball stats so the Body can perform, I can’t help dying
of laughter.

Sex is one of those funny topics you’re not
supposed to talk about with your parents due to
reasons of sheer embarrassment. When my mother
was pregnant with my younger brother, my father
called me into his den, cleared his throat a little, said
something about bees, and handed me a book entitled
The Wonderful Origin Of Life. 1 learned that sperm
and eggs made a baby, even though Dad kept talking
about some bird looking for our house.

I learned nothing whatsoever about the process
itself, That was for my eighth-grade PE teacher, who
tried to instruct us on the mysteries of sex with apiece
of cinema we called The Film. The fact that the
teacher had just had a vasectomy sort of deflated his
facade of being “one of the guys.” The girls got to go
into aroom with a nurse, and came out one hour later
with very puzzled looks on their faces. They saw The
Film too, and as a result became feminist male-
bashers.

So high school inherited this mass of untutored
and inexperienced children who wished to stride onto
the field of sexual encounters like a bunch of Clint

Eastwoods --- say little, get the job done, and leave
with your gun in its holster and a whistle on your lips.
Going to single-sex boarding school in rural Virginia
put a damper on that idea. During mixers, teachers
would wander the grounds outside the gym and poke
into bushes and ditches with thousand-watt flash-
lights. “Necking” became exceedingly difficult to do
safely. One couple got caught in a dorm room, a
Cardinal Sin. I had a resident priest in my head who
looked like the Catholic priest on Cheers and shouted
about purgatory and burning fire. His counterpart, a
sly gentleman with a goatee, tail, and pitchfork, often
shut the priest up in a box and created erotic visions
of female dancers in my brain. Neither side won that
strange war. I felt like a battleground for the damned.

This environment created a number of very
frustrated young men who entered college, that won-
derful institution of knowledge that consists of en-
gaging teachers, challenging courses and absolutely
no rules whatsoever. At my boarding school, you
went to bed, ate dinner, attended class, rose from bed,
and performed in athletic events, all at a prescribed
time. In college, you can often sleep till noon, find
alcohol anywhere, and meet girls every single night.
Needless to say, I was a bit confused that these
creatures I had considered as incomprehensible sexual
tormentors were now sharing the classroom with me
and were often smarter than I was. A very liberating
and chaotic situation.

And the topic of sex became wildly different.
While I had once had a girlfriend at boarding school
whom I saw once every two months for five hours at
atime, I could now see girls twenty-four hours a day
and possess a real relationship if I so desired. I was
more confused than ever. I felt like Woody Allen,
fretting over the mysteries of what lay beyond.

eventually ended up witha girlfriend and doing
fine. I even became good friends with a few girls, an
unfathomable idea in high school since all relation-
ships with females were considered preludes to do-
ing the wild thing. The conflicting devil and priest
that had resided in my head took a vacation. I was a
new man in uncharted territory.

Sex is still a very strange topic But at least I can
ponder over its mysteries without having my con-
science create a shocked image of an old priest,
jabbing his finger at me in derision and shame, Oh
yeah, the little devil guy sends his best from time to
time. But of course I don’t listen to him.

Individuality
is irrelevant

My VIEw

 

By Brian Carpenter

 

Hostility to the welfare state, belief in laissez-
faire capitalism, or the attitude that government is

- the problem, are a few of the basic tenets of the »

Republican party. While most people who de-
scribe themselves today as “Republicans” would
agree with these positions, how many of them are
aware of the underlying concept: the individual,
and his actions, free of interference, are the best
way to the goal of a “good” society?

The individual is considered to be of the ut-
most importance. Operating on the fairly safe be-
lief that this is the ideological underpinning of the
Republican party’s policies, a simple look at the
world in 1992 reveals that the Republican party
ideology, or the “cult of the individual” is no
longer tenable --- individualism as envisioned by
the Republicans is dead.

Developments world-wide are slowly destroy-
ing the peculiarly American belief in the “‘cult of
the individual.” Population is increasing, and the
earth is not expanding. More and more people
must share an increasingly smaller pie. Asa whole,
societies world-wide are becoming more drawn
together, connected by electronics, trade, and tour-
ism. No longer can a
nation act without
considering theeffects
its actions will have
on other countries.

What does this
mean for the “cult of
the individual?” It
means that people can
no longer live and go about their lives in an isolated
bubble. One hundred years ago, any hardworking
American could move west, and given the small
population, live essentially on his own, his actions
affecting no one else's. As people are forced to live
closer and closer together, it becomes harder and
harder to cling to one’s individualism. We become
inextricably bound up in a world community that
is interconnected in a myriad of ways.

The United States is the only country in the
world that still clings to the “cult of the individual.”
This has been obvious in our society for time
immemorial. Our heroes are all individuals: Super-
man, the Lone Ranger and Rambo. The individual
is not worshipped, but idolized.

Our society is becoming increasingly
communitarian. We no longer hear of the
Rockefellers, the Vanderbilts and Co. Why? Be-
cause today the individual cannot master the in-
credibly large amount of information necessary to
run a large company. The result is the increasing
power of the middle management, those who con-
trol the technical information. The business world
is becoming communitarian, not just in the diver-
sified power of most large American companies,
but in such organizations as the World Bank, the
International Monetary fund and the European
Community. The Republican party clings to a
business philosophy that is irrelevant.

Continuing to believe that the individual is of
utmost importance in a world that puts increas-
ingly less power in the hands of the individual is
illogical. Promoting the individual’s actions as
noble and good, whatever they may be, isno longer
possible in a world where our actions affect the
entire world, America is the only place in the world
where individualism has been carried to such
lengths, Individualism may have been workable in
a world where one’s actions affected only one’s
self, but such a world no longer exists, and never
will again. Why does the Republican party cling to
an ideal that is rapidly becoming irrelevant?

Our society is
becoming
increasingly
commuitarian.

Phi staffers win
regional awards

To the Editor:

Ithought your readers might like to know that
Phi staffers won two awards in this year’s Society
of Professional Journalists Region II Mark of
Excellence competition. Former co-editor Rick
Peltz won the Spot News reporting category, and
Craig Burke and co-editor Tom Eisenhauer fin-
ished second in the In-Depth Reporting category.
Those were the only two entries the Phi submitted,
so Messrs. Peltz, Eisenhauer and Burke are batting
1.000.

Among the Phi’s competitors were campus
papers from the University of North Carolina and
the University of Maryland, with staffs several
times as large as the Phi’s.

Congratulations gentlemen, and may the Phi
submit many more entries next year.

Petowners should
be responsible

To the Editor:

Several months ago a big, beautiful, gentle
Tennessee Walker Coon Hound came to myhome.
He had an out-of-state phone number, which I
called thinking some hunter had lost his dog. I was
given the name and phone number of a W&L
student.

I have since then called Rick a number of
times to come after Beau. Let me stress that at no
time was Beau any trouble to me. I was afraid he
would get hit by a car, hurt by another dog or even
shot by a local farmer.

At this time Rick has never called me or come

. after his dog..Always.one.of his housemates has
-come afteyBeauss- 6+ + nen
Today my fear became real. Beau came to my
home dripping blood from some type of injury to
his neck, ear, and jaw. I secured him by a chain,
called Rick at about 4:00 pm, and told him Beau
was badly hurt and needed medical care. I do not
drive, so I could not take him to a veterinarian.

There was no use to call Animal Control or
the Sheriff, because when I have called before
they said it was a weekend, either tie the dog up, or
let him go. “Too bad if the dog gets hurt,” I guess.

After several hours Rick's housemate came
after Beau. I asked him to tell Rick that I was very,
very angry at him for the neglect of this big,
beautiful, gentle dog.

My point is this: please write (as if it would do
any good) and ask the students to please secure
their pets by chain or pen so they will not be hurt.

I cry thinking about this animal in pain, be-
cause his master was too lazy to secure him by

chain or pen.

Rick, if you can’t or won’t take care of Beau,
please find a good home for him. Give him to me

Catholics must
vote pro-life

To the Editor: ‘

All the Democratic presidential candidates
are pro-abortion, including Catholic Jerry Brown.
Speaking as a Roman Catholic who participates in
the holy sacrifice of the Mass each day and prays
the Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary daily, it is
my discernment that no Catholic may vote for a
man who will facilitate abortions by appropriation
and legislation if elected. A Catholic is morally
bound to abstain from supporting those who ac-
cept the murder of fetal human beings.

If a Catholic votes for a pro-abortion presi-
dential candidate, this individual commits a sin as
he or she becomes a voluntary participant in a
process which ultimately leads to murder. The sin
of murder is a serious manner and, therefore, a
mortal sin. Those who die unrepentant with mortal
sins on their souls go to Hell, instructs the Catholic
Church.

Catholic Canon Law asserts that the woman
who aborts her child and those who perform the
abortion as well as well as those who pay for the
abortion are automatically excommunicated. It
would appear that this excommunication applies
to the willful pro-abortion voter also. Academic
theologians and American bishops have not wanted
to make this assertion. The episcopates are main-
taining a strange silence about the moral implica-
tions of voting for a pro-abortion candidate.

If a Catholic does not wish to vote for the
Republican candidate, he may refrain from vot-
ing. There are no circumstances in which a Catho-
lic may vote for a pro-abortion candidate. Confes-
sion is required for absolution of this sin, a mortal
sin!

AIDS does not
differentiate

To the Editor:

I am writing about the article, “AIDS & the
Heterosexual,” by Marc Short, that appeared in the
March 1992 issue of the W&L Spectator. Mr.
Short confidently states, “But what students should
know is that if they enjoy healthy monogamous
relationships, then they are not at risk of contract-
ing AIDS.” (p.13) Unfortunately, many of the
students who are involved in “monogamous rela-
tionships” while in college had put themselves at
risk for AIDS even before they entered college.

 

According to the Department of Health and
Human Services, more than 40% of high school
students say they have had multiple partners. There-
fore, one’s college partner may not be as pristine
as one had hoped. While I agree that the use of
condoms does not guarantee immunity from the
disease, itis not “absurd,” as Mr. Short believes, to
strongly suggest the use of a latex condom. While
I agree that there is no easy solution, I do not
believe that Mr. Short should assume that the
disease only affects homosexuals, drug users and
people not as “intelligent” as W&L students.

My mother is a nurse on a hospital floor that
treats AIDS patients. Every day, she sees more and
more bright, young, heterosexual people walk
through the door to receive treatment for AIDS.
AIDS does not differentiate by one’s sexual pref-
erence, educational level or class. Let us not na-
ively believe that we are always “safe” here in our
W&L world.

Sincerely,
Sarah Drain, ‘94

Alternate PC will
stop the clock

To the Editor:
I am writing in response to Karen Orr and
Mitch Neurock’s recent “My View” article. You
would think that college graduates who had shown
enough intelligence in terms of GPAs and LSATs
to get into law school would also be able to know
the difference between grammar and style, but
alas, such is not the case. In their complaint against
Professor Handelman for asking her class to fol-
low the American Bar Association: style guide-
lines for using gender-neutral language, they claim
that their desire to use “men” when they mean
“people” and “he” when they mean “someone” is
“good grammar.” No it is not. It has nothing to do
with grammar. Take for example, a sentence such
as this: “A law student recently attacked a faculty
member for violating his rights to use the pronoun
of his political choice.” Grammar would dictate
only that the pronoun (here, “his”) be third person
possessive. Style, however, would be a matter of
deciding, do we want the reader to assume that the
law student in question is male? If not, if we want
to suggest that a woman might be a law student,
and that a woman might hold such views, then we
would search for a pronoun that would not elimi-
nate the possibility. The sentence might be plural-
ized: “Two law students recently attacked...etc.”
The point is that the problem is not grammar.
Some claim that they use the male pronouns be-
cause it is so difficult to find substitutes, but all it
takes is a little imagination and skill-qualities we
hope our students might possess, or at least attain.

In the real world, the world of professional
writing, Ms. Orr and Mr. Neurock will find that
most. professional organizations have published
style guidelines that ask that people use non-sexist
language. The ABA is not alone. It would be a
failure in our educational mission for us not to
prepare our students for what is going to be ex-
pected of them when they are called updn to be
professionals.

Asto the mind-boggling suggestion that “gen-
der-neutral language dictates favoritism toward
women,” how in the world does the use of such
words as “people,” “their,” or “his or her” do
anything except suggest that women are a fully
participating part of the human race? For someone
to try to perpetuate language forms that are out
dated and exclusive is not a matter of “good
grammar,” it is an example of an alternate version
of our political correctness that attempts to stop the
clock or turn back. Wake up and welcome to the
real world. There are now both men and women in
it, even in law school, even at W&L.

Pamela H. Simpson, Professor of Art History

Leary, Bensinger argue drug legalization, rights

By FRANCESCA KEFALAS
Phi Staff Reporter

The debate on drugs came to
Washington and Lee last Thursday
night when former Harvard psy-
chology professor Timothy Leary and
former Drug Enforcement Agency
Director Peter Bensinger argued over
legalization and individual rights.

Each speaker had 20 minutes to
make his point and five minutes for
rebuttal. They then took questions
from the audience.

Leary, an admitted LSD user for
30 years, argued that the federal gov-
ernment interfered in private lives
when it made drugs illegal.

Leary said the war on drugs is a
second civil war with the potential to
be as devastating as the first.

“How can you possibly use a |

metaphor for warfare when you're
talking about the private lives of the
citizens of our nation,” Leary asked.

Leary went on to compare
today’s federal government with the
U.S.S.R.’s under Stalin.

Bensinger disputed Leary’s pic-
ture of a tyrannical government im-
posing its laws on the private lives of
the people.

“When I was head of the DEA I
didn’t think I made the laws, the
federal government doesn’t make the
laws, the people do at county levels,”
Bensinger said. “No one has the civil
right to break the laws.”

Leary said he testified before a
U.S. Senate committee in 1964 about
classifying and legalizing drugs.

“We should educate people how
to avoid drug abuse, and the govern-
ment should license drugs just the
way you license the right to use a
car,” Leary said.

Leary said a person would have
to complete a training session on
how to use the drug before being
licensed. Leary’s plan would require
the person to pay for the training and
license, which would raise revenue
for the states.

Bensinger believes the police
need to get closer to people and es-
tablish trust in order to halt drug

Former Harvard psychology professor Timothy a Lee Chapel audience. Leary argued that U.S.
Leary states his case for drug legalization before drug laws interfere in people's private lives.

abuse. He also said education is vital
in keeping people from trying drugs.

“Tt’s more important to prevent
crimes than make arrests,” Bensinger
said.

However, Bensinger did say the
federal government should spend as
much on treatment of addicts as it
does on enforcement.

“There should be more money
for treatment,” he said. “The DEA
budget is $400 million -- treatment
dollars should equal that budget..”

W&L Professor of Psychology
Leonard Jarrard, who teaches a class
on psychoactive drugs, agreed with
both Leary and Bensinger.

“Most people in academia feel
that the real emphasis should be on
education,” said Jarrard.

Bensinger said that drug use does
not only affect the users, but the
people around them as well. He cited
an example where the post office in
Boston tested all new employees for
drugs. Those who tested positive for

illegal drugs eventually had more
accidents, were absent from work

more often and had more discipline
problems than those who tested nega-
tive,

“People that use drugs are less
safe and less predictable,” Bensinger
said.

Bensinger said England tried to
legalize heroin and found that ad-
dicts still bought street heroin, which
was stronger than the legal heroin.

Jarrard said from the data he has
seen that the English experiment was
not as great a disaster as Bensinger
portrayed, nor as much of a success
as Leary said.

Leary argued that legal drugs,
not illegal drugs, are the problem. He
said 600,000-700,000 Americans die
from using legal drugs every year.

“How does anyone die from an
overdose of cocaine, considering the

| expense and inflation,” he said.

According to Jarrard, Leary’s
statistics are inaccurate.

Leary said that making drugs
illegal is actually harming the public.

“Once you illegalize something
that people are going to do anyway,

you take away consumer protection,”
he said. “If the DEA is so worried
about the health of the people, why
don’t they put some money into the
environment?”

Leary said that, as a scientist, he
would love to have his theories
proven wrong, but said that bureau-
crats like the DEA would not allow
their theories to be similarly scruti-
nized.

Jarrard, whose specialty is physi-
ological psychology, was disturbed
by Leary calling himself a scientist.
Jarrard said Leary received his de-
grees and training in social psychol-
ogy, a field closer to sociology than
biology.

“He’s never had the training to
justify the kinds of statements he was
making,” Jarrard said.

Leary’s unorganized speech
prompted speculations from many
people including Jarrard.

“Either he is in the preliminary
stages of Alzheimer’s or he has taken
too many of the wrong kinds of
drugs,” Jarrard said. “Or both.”

23 N. Main St., Lexington
Open Mon. thru Sat. 10-5:30

 

 

 

Q: What will happen if you don’t
pay the infamous Lexington car tax?

A: You, or your parents, might be
called into court, have the amount taken
out of your paycheck, or have your
credit affected.

The city treasurer has filed “‘war-
rants in debt” against students and par-
ents who have received bills and not
paid the tax, asking them to appear in
court on May 13,

City Treasurer Pat DeLaney said
this is not the first time she has filed the
warrants and that it is a common pro-
cess when bills are not paid.

“We send these to anyone who
doesn’t pay their taxes,” DeLaney said.

DeLaney said that people usually
pay the bill once they receive notices to
appear in court.

“Of those that go to court, a fair
number will get a judgement against
them,” DeLaney said.

DeLaney said that if people do not
pay the tax after such a judgement, she
can have their wages garnished or have
their assets seized.

DeLaney also said a notice that

the tax has not been paid will appear on
the person’s credit record.

“Six months or a year down the
road, a person might find their credit
has been affected,” DeLaney said. “It
comes back to haunt you.”

Some students who were called
into court said they might pay the tax
now, but they won’t like it.

“T’m sure the judge will say ‘Pay

 

up’ and I suppose
I will,” second-
year law student
Maury Kroontje
said. “It’s a high
price for the small
privilege of driv-

 

ingoncity streets.”

“I’m not
planning on pay-
ing it,” junior Christopher Lee said.
“Tt’s ridiculous.”

Junior Sam Rock thinks more stu-
dents should go to court instead of
writing a check as soon as they see a
court summons.

“Only one person I know of has
taken it to court and he won,” Rock
said. “If more people would do that,
maybe the city would have to retract
the tax.”

W&L alumnus elected Tuesday
to Lexington City Council

 

By KATIE YDEL
Phi Staff Reporter

 

A Washington and Lee alumnus was one of the three
new Lexington City Council members elected Tuesday.

Greg Raetz, ’71, finished third among four candidates,
with 23 percent of the vote. Other winners were Reverend
J.B. Harris, with 26 percent, and Jane Ellington, with 32
percent.

Executive Director of Development at W&L Lex
McMillan came in fourth with 19 percent of the vote.

Mayor H.E. “Buddy” Derrick ran unopposed in the
election.

Raetz, alocal accountant, has lived in Lexington for all
but five years since coming to W&L as a freshman. He said
he thinks it will be helpful to have someone on the council
who has a good understanding of Washington and Lee.

Having been both a student of W&L and a resident of
Lexington, Raetz said he is in a good position to help
relations between the colleges and the community.

Raetz said the city needs to keep students at W&L and
VMI better informed on issues like the car tax and student
voter registration.

Raetz told The Rockbridge Weekly that the major issue
facing the city is upgrading the sewage treatment plant.

Harris, a five year resident of Lexington, is a pastor of
the First Baptist Church. Lexington native Jane Ellington is
currently a member of the Lexington School Board and is
a strong proponent of a plan to merge the city and county
school systems.

Ellington also said that encouraging area residents to
recycle will be one of her goals while a member of the
council.

Harris believes that a lack of affordable housing for
low and moderate income families and a lack of recreational
opportunities for local youths are major problems facing
Lexington.

The open seats on the Council were vacated be Sidney
Brown, Louise Moore, and W&L Director of Com-
munications Brian Shaw.

Shaw said that he did not run for re-election because
the Council required too much of a time commitment.

Shaw also said he became involved in conflicts of
interest with some issues involving the community and the
university, and that he often abstained from issues dealing
with the university.

Grad earns rice and beans

Recent alum teaches English in Costa Rican village

 

By RICK PELTz
Phi Central American Correspondant

SAN JOSE, Costa Rica - Amanda
Hughen, '91, is earning her rice and
beans in Costa Rica.

Hughen, a volunteer for the
Harvard Institute for International
Development World Teach program,
has been teaching English in the Pa-
cific-coast community of Quepos for
two months. She will continue there
until December, she said.

“I knew I was interested in travel-
ling after gradua-

 

yelling over other voices to be heard.”

Because Quepos is a popular des-
tination for North American tourists,
Hughen said the students are “very
open” to learning English.

She said her teaching style also
helps capture their interest.

“A lot of teachers here are still
using rote, repetition,” Hughen said. “I
teach .. . [with] the communicative
approach. We do a lot more talking in
Class, a lot less memorization, using
material rather than regurgitating.”

Because Costa Rica offers little

Quepos, Hughen said, is a three-day-
old international newspaper, or infor-
mation from the community’s one sat-
ellite dish, installed by the United Fruit
Company.

Hughen lives with a local family,
and said she had grown accustomed to
the culture, even “rice and beans, three
meals a day, every single day.”

But culture-shock works both
ways, and Hughen said her presence in
Quepos has unsettled the natives’ ste-

 

tion,” said Hughen, an
English major who
also took Spanish.
“But I didn’t want to

just travel city to city. pa
I wanted to stay in one -
country.”

In February,
Hughen and eight
other North American
volunteers travelled

 

to Puriscal, Costa 4 Queros
Rica, less than 20 5 Ista Dei Coco
miles from Quepos | © G0FO0€ Nicova
for three weeks of ori-
entation.

reotypes.
“People here see North Ameri-
cans as
‘Dynasty,’ ‘Cosby
Show,’ ‘Simpsons,’
movies and tourists,”

she said. “But some-
one living in their
community” gives a
more realistic image.
World Teach costs
about $6,000 per vol-
unteer, Hughen said.
Of that, each volun-
teer is expected to
raise about $2,300.
Costs cover room and
board, plane fare and
health insurance.

PANAMA

 

 

ground in Costa Rican schools, cul-
ture, history and environmental edu-
cation, plus “very intensive” lessons in
Spanish, Hughen said the volunteers
dispersed to assignments all over Costa
Rica, “mostly in rural towns.”

In Quepos, with a population of
about 13,000, Hughen said she teaches
fifth and sixth grades.

Her students range in age from 10
to 15.

She is the only English teacher for
two separate grade schools.

She said she also teaches adults at
night.

“So far, it’s been great,” she said.
“The kids are incredible, really happy.
They have a lot of energy.”

But teaching amid a foreign cul- °

ture took some getting used to, Hughen
said.
“Thekids are totally undisciplined.
You have to have a sense of humor,"
Hughen said. **I had get to used to

alternative to public school education,
Hughen said the schools are “incred-
ibly homogeneous, socioeconomi-
cally.” And the people that are all in
one society are not "snobs," she said.

World Teach, which also places
volunteers in China, Ecuador, Namibia,
Poland, South Africa and Thailand,
prepares its teachers for culture shock
and homesickness.

“In orientation, they gave us a
culture-shock chart,” Hughen said.

It said to expect “moments of ela-
tion” at first, then to hit “rock bottom
anywhere between the first month and
first six months we’re here . . . to be
frustrated with the culture and lan-
guage. They told us to call each other
and see other volunteers. We’ve al-
ready used that.”

Hughen said she has not yet hit
“rock bottom,” despite being “‘cut off
from North America.”

The most timely news available in

Hughen said volun-
teers are supposed to get a stipend
from the Costa Rican government of
about $38 per month, but that has not
yet arrived.

“The Costa Rican people are so
open and friendly,” Hughen said.
“They know we are volunteers ....
They’ll give you the shirts off their
backs.”

Hughen said she recommends
World Teach, which is “very competi-
tive,” to people “comfortable with be-
ing uncomfortable... . Someone inter-
ested in travelling, but seeing another
country from the grassroots.”

After her teaching job is over,
Hughen said she would like to bus
through Central America.

“Central America seemed like this
dangerous place” before she came,
Hughen said, “but in reality right now
it’s really peaceful, with the right pre-
cautions, not as dangerous as on the
nightly news.”

Looking for signs of suicide,
dealing with parents this summer

 

Ask Dr. Worth

By Dr. JAMES Wort

fe}: nana 4 there was a suicide at one of the
* nearby women’s colleges, and I’m wonder-
ing if there are any signs I should be aware

of that could tip me off if a student here is thinking of

doing something to himself.
a: signs or signals of suicidal intent. Perhaps
the most obvious is a threat, which could be
fairly direct or could be implicit. Most people who
threaten suicide do not actually kill themselves, but
most people who do kill themselves have made threats.
So if someone ever makes a reference about sui-
cide, explicit or implicit,

This is an important question. Yes, there are

this?
EN: that they are, cannot fully appreciate the

extent to which the breaking away process is
accelerated during your college years.

They have high school expectations of you, time-
honored rules and traditions about your conduct that
are often difficult for them to change.

So when you return home, they revert back to the

contrary, by asking, you give the healthy part of the
suicidal person a chance to be heard and even to ask for
help. You could save a life.

Almost everyone who is suicidal is also seriously
depressed.

If you have a friend you know to be very de-
pressed, they are more at risk for suicidal behavior.

Depression is not always easy to recognize. It’s
not just being sad or blue.

Clinical depression is characterized by apathy,
lower energy, tension and anxiety, irritability, mood
swings and/or changes in a person’s appetite or sleep-
ing patterns.

Anyone who is depressed and has a close friend or
family member who committed suicide is at even
greater risk.

Your parents may need more time to accept your
growing maturity and independence from them.

By your not challenging them too energetically at
first, they may be able to relax and lighten up later on.

If you are lucky enough to have parents (or even
just one parent) who are open to communication, sit
down and talk the matter over with them.

Bring up the idea that you are now used to making
a lot more of your own rules.

Tell them you don’t want to be disrespectful of
their values and attitudes but some compromises may
need to be worked out for everyone to be comfortable.

The most difficult part is handling your anger. If
you blow up at them, you appear to be the very child
you are claiming to have grown past.

But if you do nothing, you probably will feel
demeaned and unhappy. Be patient but direct. Point
out that all relationships involve compromise.

If you live under their roof they have a right to set
reasonable ground rules, and you need to acknowledge
that. At the same time it is not reasonable for them to
ignore your growth and development. As an adult, you
will relate to them mainly out of your enjoyment of
them, not dependence on them.

Let them know you look forward to a successful
adult relationship with them, one that will take patience
and understanding on both sides.

Wé&LIFE

 

 

He slices, he dices, he philosophizes

91 grad's new nels satirizes wal via Herman the Cockroach

 

By DAvip WILMINGTON
Phi Staff Reporter

 

“T subscribe to the nonsectarian
Relaxation, Leisure and Goofing Off
Ethic, the central tenet of which is that
summer vacation is a time for college
Students to sit around the house all day
drinking beer in their underwear.”

Thus begins W&L graduate Jon
Sbar’s new, and first, book to be pub-

lished.

through college life, including many |
examples from Sbar’s experience at |

W&L.

Referred toas “Exclusive Univer- |

sity nestled in the mountains of Tradi-
tional, Virginia,” W&L is depicted
through various satiric episodes.

Former Ring-tum Phi humor col-
umnist Sbar applies his familiar irrev-
erent treatment to everything from fra-
ternity Rush to Fancy Dress and ex-
ams,

Although most of the names have
been changed (to protect Sbar, not the
innocent), most W&L students will be
able to identify certain English profes-
sors, fraternity events, coaches and
local women’s colleges.

The book is loosely tied together
by the college adventures of Joe
“Black” Smith and his various friends.

Early on, Sbar mentions his ob-
session with a girl named Cassandra,
and the subsequent recurrence of vari-
ous characters with this name makes a
good running joke.

Other recurring themes include a
lovesick, philosophizing cockroach,
who writes entire pages of the book
while Jon is away from his computer,
and various references to Ernest
Hemingway, who writes a chapter him-
self (after being discovered alive on an
island with JFK, Jim Morrison and
Elvis).

The Hemingway chapter, in which
“Papa” narrates a Fancy Dress week-
end, is particularly hilarious because
characters from his own books keep
popping up and talking about how

in lieu of actual works, I would spend
my summer writing a book.”

Sbar, who graduated magna cum
laude in 1991 with an English/Com-
munications double major, is currently
employed at The Sun, a newspaper
located in “some of the few places in
Florida where it's legal to drive a golf

cart on the roa

During an interview from a pay
phone in a Winn-Dixie parking lot,
Sbar discussed his general opinions on
editors.

“Thate editors, they ruin my life,”
he said.

His current news writing assign-
ments are stories he likes to do. “I like
crime,” Sbar said.

He said the reason why he didn’t
geta full journalism major was becuase
he was too lazy to take the hard editing
class. He also said that most of the
professors he had at W&L are either
no longer living or out of the country.

“That could have something
to do with me,” Sbar said.

Sbar cites former Journalism Pro-
fessor Clark Mollenhoff as a major
influence during his time at W&L,
while crediting the entire English de-
partment with teaching him “a hell of a
lot.”

Sbar cites cockroaches as a major
influence on the actual act of writing.

As a self-proclaimed nocturnal
writer, he became obsessed with kill-
ing the hordes of cockroaches that en-
tered his home at night.

He does want to make it clear that
Herman, the cockroach who writes in
the book, “‘is real ... [maintain that that
is completely true.”

As to the allusions to W&L, Sbar
agrees that several incidents in the book
are based on some private W&L jokes.

He stresses that he hopes nobody
will take the jokes too seriously.

"The truth is, I love Washington
and Lee," Sbar said. " I hope that no
one thinks I meant anything even re-
motely negative."

As to descriptions of some of the
more earthly events in W&L life, he
says ,“Reality is my defense.”

Sbar defends his writing style and
the possibility of offending people. “If
someone is sensitive or offended, I
don’t care. But I don’t write to be
offensive, I just write to make people
laugh.”

Sbar’s book comes out this July at
the retail price of $9.95.

There is talk of a special price for
W&L students and a special mail order
for graduating seniors.

to teach at Moscow State University
in Russia
this fall.

Smith
said.

universtiy. Smith said he will take his
wife and family with him. He said he
plans to leave a little earlier than
necessary so he can visit former stu-
dents in England and Germany.

Although Smith will not lec-
ture in Russian, more than half of all
Russian youth understand English.

The Fulbright Scholarship is a
competitive program that gives scho-
lars the opportunity to do research or
teach anywhere in the world.

In other EC business, the
committee on Monday voted to
reduce the waiting period between the
end of an investigation and the closed
hearing from 72 to 48 hours.

According to Wight, both the
accused and EC members felt that 72
hours was too long to wait, but that
extensions would be granted.

“If I were accused I would
want to get it over with as soon as
possible,’’ said Wight.

The EC will vote again May 11
to ratify the proposal, which would
take effect in September.

rty-one students:

get research grants’

Recipients will work with professors

 

By KEITH GRANT
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Thirty-one Washington and Lee
students have been selected for this
year’s Robert E. Lee Undergraduate
Research Program.

The students will work full time
this summer on either a_student-
planned project with the supervision
of a university professor or assist a
professor in research.

Associate Dean of the Com-
merce School Kenneth Ruscio be-
lieves that one prime benefits of the
program is that students and teachers
work together outside the classroom.

“It’s a learning exercise much
different from the classroom,” said
Ruscio, who will be working with
junior Jay Darden. ‘‘In this project,
we're like peers.”’

Ruscio and Darden will spend
the summer on campus investigating
the legality of funding inequities
among Virginia secondary school
districts.

Ruscio said schools in Northern
Virginia receive more money from
the state per student than schools in
Southwestern Virginia, a trend that
has prompted some school districts to
take the issue to court because it may
be illegal.

consultant to Democratic party lead-
ers, he is now a visiting professor at
Georgetown University.

Nelson’s speech will focus on the
violence that has developed in the
“arc of crisis’’ from the Adriatic Sea
to the Caucasus Mountains.

“It’s finally clear that what we
see emerging from communism, is
not a free Europe, but a Europe divid-
ed and weak,’’ Nelson said.

He said that recent violence in
central Asia makes him unsure of
exactly what the most up-to-date
examples will be next week. Regard-
less, the lecture will center on Ameri-
can foreign policy in Eurasia.

we can still do, with an emphasis on

is paralyzed, forced to justify its ev-

Moreover, the constitution goes to
such lengths to protect the people,
critics say, that the country’s resourc-
es are no longer sufficient to meet its
demands. For example, low-cost
housing, social security, vocational
training, secondary education and
need-based university scholarships are
all constitutionally-stipulated govern-
ment responsibilities. The country
simply cannot pay for everything,
critics say.

In an effort to strengthen the
country financially, the Costa Rican
government is promoting the develop-
ment of tourist resorts on the Pacific

cited drugs as the issue that most

Nevertheless, Costa Rica is a

The future of Costa Rica is now

Generals drop finale; miss tourney

 

By SEAN O’ROURKE
Phi Sports Editor

For any athlete, there’s no tougher time of
the season than the off-season.

It is the time when all the bad plays creep
into your dreams and all the good ones are
remembered with a sigh.

The Washington and Lee men’s tennis team
‘ must now face that time, but they can do it with
, their heads held high.

The Generals faced a ‘‘do-or-don’t go”’
situation last weekend when they traveled to 8th-
ranked Swarthmore. If they won, in all likelihood
they go to the Division III tournament. If they lost,

‘ it was over.

Swarthmore 7, W&L 2.

The score is somewhat deceptive. Four of

' the matches were decided in the third set. The
_ Generals took one of the four.

Man-for-man we played very well,’’ said

: head coach Gary Franke. ‘‘It all came down to
losing the three three-setters.”’

The two most important came in the singles
competition. Junior Wes Ruggles lost at No. 4, 6-2,
3-6, 6-3; and sophomore David Schweppe fell 3-6,
6-4, 6-4, Added to Swarthmore’s three other singles
victories, the match was over.

‘‘The scores were indicative of a close

' match,’’ said senior Richard Yates. ‘‘If some things
went our way, we would have won.”’

Yates lost his No. 1 singles match 6-2, 6-2.
His doubles partner, senior Tom Mazziotti, also lost

at No. 3 singles, 6-1, 6-1. Nevertheless, the two
rebounded to post the Generals second win of the
day at No. 2 doubles, 6-3, 1-6, 6-3. It was the only
three-set match the Generals won.

WA&L picked up its only singles win at No.
2, as sophomore Robby MacNaughton continued
his impressive play by polishing off his opponent,
6-4, 6-1.

The Generals other three defeats came at
No. 6 singles, where sophomore Jon Ingram lost 6-
2, 6-3. The No. 1 doubles team of MacNaughton
and Schweppe lost the third three-setter of the
afternoon, 2-6, 6-3, 6-3; finally, the team of
Ruggles and senior Kelly Vandever lost at No. 3
doubles 7-6(7-3), 6-2.

“The four and five[singles] matches were
really close,’’ said Mazziotti. ‘‘If one of them won,
it could have turned out different. We played well,
but just came up short.”’

The Generals ended their season at 8-10.
Despite the sub-.500 season, the Generals had a lot
to be proud of.

They were ODAC champions for the eighth
consecutive year, and their ODAC dual-match
winning steak was extended to 40. Plus, they had
very good showings against some of the top teams
in all the college divisions.

‘*Overall we had a great year,”’ said Franke.
‘The only setback was the lost to Wooster.’’

Vandever, a W&L Scholar-Athlete, said not
achieving their preseason goal was the biggest
disappointment of the season.

“‘The season is a little The We

‘*Both [Head] Coach [Doug]

es on the day.

W&L senior goalie Coleman
Devlin didn’t allow a goal in the
game’s final 20 minutes while
making 14 saves on the day.

“Coleman was the first per-
son that Coach Bartlett went and
congratulated after the game,”’ said
Hope. ‘‘He’s an excellent low-ball
goalie, and we shot at his feet all
day. He came up really big.”’

Sophomore midfielder Colin

David Lefkowitz added two goals
each for W&L.

Ott made 16 saves for VMI

we had some tough defeats early in the season.”’

This is only the second time in the last eight
years the Generals didn’t receive a team bid to the
Division II tournament. The last time was in 1990.

Even with the tough defeats throughout the
season, all the Generals managed to post impres-
sive records.

Yates finished at 20-11, MacNaughton
ended at 18-8, while Mazziotti had a 10-16 record.
The bottom three singles also carried their load.
Ruggles finished 9-16, Schweppe ended at 14-10,
and Ingram went 8-8. Overall, the Generals singles
record was 85-80. The doubles teams posted a
record of 43-38.

The focus now shifts to the individual
Division III tournament. Yates has already qualified
for the event at Emory University in Atlanta, while
MacNaughton must now wait and see if someone
withdrawals because he is the first national alter-
nate.

Yates says his principal concern before the
tournament is being physically ready.

“‘The key is to stay in good physical shape
this next week-and-a-half, and to go in ready.
Anybody has a chance to win. There’s not anybody
head-and-shoulders above the rest.”’

For Richard Yates, Tom Mazziotti and Kelly §

Vandever, this is all she wrote. All three say the
things they will miss the most is the camaraderie
and the competitiveness.

This year’s race will feature 14
teams with seven riders each. Ten of
the teams are corporate-sponsored,
while four of the teams are amateur
national teams from Russia, Germany,
Belgium and the U.S.

Greg LeMond, the first
American ever to win the grueling
Tour de France, will be racing for
the “‘Z’’ team from France. He will
be wearing a light blue jersey with a
yellow and red Z on it. LeMond
finished 12th in last year’s race.

Defending Tour de France
winner, Laurent Fignon, will be
wearing Gatorade’s green, black and
orange jersey.

Spectators should look for the
rider with a yellow jersey, this
indicates the leader of the race up to
that stage.

The prize money for the 1992
Tour Du Pont is $200,000.

Five lax seniors leave on winning note

solid season nonetheless.

“*We had a lot of guys improve
toward the end of the year,”’ he said.
““We had a good season. Three years
ago, people would be doing backflips
for a 9-5 season.”’

But not this year. The seniors
will walk away from their lacrosse
careers with an overall record of 33-
22 and the knowledge that they
helped rebuild a once-proud lacrosse
tradition, Stagnitta is thankful for that.

“This is a class that achieved
because they worked real hard,”” he
said. ‘‘Huke couldn’t catch when he
was a freshman. Roberts and O’Brien
didn’t come from established lacrosse
programs. They all had to spend a lot
of time working on their own, and
hopefully the younger kids will real-
ize how hard they worked.”’

And they can also remember
that the last time they took the field,
they came away winners.

Seniors leave mark on men’s lax program

 

By JAY PLOTKIN
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Over the last four years, the
Washington and Lee men’s lacrosse
team has come a long way.

In 1989, the Generals finished
just 4-9, and just three years later, the
Generals had put together three
straight winning seasons, finishing
this season with a 9-5 clip.

As the team improved over the
years, so did its players, six of whom
will graduate in June. As freshmen,
only Drew Anton played significantly
for then-coach Dennis Daly.

Anton scored four goals as a
freshman playing both midfield and
attack, and was the team’s top fresh-
man, winning the C. W. Pacy award.
Goalie Coleman Devlin made one
start in 1989 and made 12 saves in a

loss to Roanoke.

Jeff Roberts and Tom Sned-
eker played as a defensive attackmen
and were used only on riding situa-
tions. Jeff O’Brien and Robert Huke
both didn’t see enough action to earn
a letter.

After winning their final game
of 1989, 10-9 in overtime against
Virginia Military in the Lee-Jackson
Classic, the W&L lacrosse program
underwent a changing of the guard.

Jim Stagnitta replaced Daly as
coach, and the program turned
around. The Generals went a remark-
able 9-4, earned a national ranking of
11th and were seemingly one game
away from an NCAA Tournament
berth. The sophomores, after sitting
for one year, played some significant
roles.

Devlin served as Tom Cost-

ello’s able bodied back-up, and Huke
was ready if W&L’s solid defense of
All-Americans Reid Campbell and
Mike Nunan and David Farace need-
ed a break. O’Brien played significant
minutes as the defensive midfielder,
and both Huke and O’Brien earned
their first letters.

But it was on the offense
where the sophomores made their
presence felt. Roberts was inserted as
an offensive attackman and played
consistently as the third attackman.
He scored 19 goals, the second high-
est on the team, and added nine as-
sists.

Devlin said the difference
between the two seasons was one
he’ll never forget.

“I remember the transition
that the program has gone through,
both in coaching and the results,’” he

W&L wins fourth Classic

 

By JAY PLOTKIN
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee is making
it a habit in the Lee-Jackson Lacrosse
Classic of starting slowly and rallying
for a win.

Twice in the previous three
meetings, the Virginia Military Insti-
tute held W&L in check before the
Generals mounted a late charge that
caught the Keydets.

In 1989, VMI led 9-8 before
WA&L rallied for a 10-9 overtime win.
In 1990, W&L led 6-5 at halftime
and exploded for 11 goals and a 18-7
victory.

The 1992 Classic was no
different. VMI led 3-2 at halftime and
5-4 in the third quarter only to watch
WA&L score the last nine goals to run
away with a 13-5 win.

Senior attackman Jeff Roberts
scored three of his four goals in the
second half to lead the explosion.

‘In the first half, their defend-
ers were trying to shut our attackmen

said. ‘‘I didn’t play much, and I never
expected we'd be playing as well as
we have over the four years.”’

Roberts was named the team’s
most improved player as a sopho-
more, but another improvement went
unseen.

The change came in the work
ethic of the group, something that
Stagnitta says the group passed on to
its younger teammates.

“‘T think the younger guys got .

an idea of what a great work ethic is

and what it takes to achieve what the ba

seniors did,’’ he said.
As juniors, they had their best
campaign, going 11-4 and reaching

off the ball,’’ said Roberts, who fin-
ished his career with 98 goals. ‘“That
made it tough for us to get the ball
and work it around. They lost their
legs in the second half, though, and
we were able to run by them.”’

VMI’s first half defense was
anchored by senior goalie Matt Ott,
who entered the game ranked fifth in
Division I with a .688 save percent-
age. Ott made six first half saves and
shut W&L out for the first 17 minutes
while his Keydets held the first half
lead.

“All year long, our strength
has been our goal tending,’’ said VMI
assistant coach David Hope. ‘‘Matt
Ott came up big like he has all sea-
son.”’

“Ott came out hot,’’ said

W&L head coach Jim Stagnitta, who
has never lost to VMI. ‘‘He made us
change some shots, but we also
missed some pretty easy shots. We
had our opportunities, but we were a
little nervous.”’

The Generals settled down at

the NCAA Tournament. Huke started Fa

halftime and claimed a brief lead on
back-to-back goals by freshman
attackman Andy Dutton and senior
midfielder Drew Anton. The Keydets,
though, answered the W&L charge
with back-to-back goals of their own
from junior midfielder Spencer Gill
and senior midfielder Richard Owens
to take a 5-4 lead, their last lead of
the game.

Junior midfielder David
Schiminger scored just 20 seconds
after Owens’ goal to tie the game at
5-5, and junior midfielder John Hunt-
er scored 18 seconds later to give
WAL the lead for good with 4:43 left
in the third quarter.

The Generals were able to
keep their momentum because faceoff
specialist Derek Hutton, a junior, kept
winning faceoffs. He won 13 of the
18 he took, including seven of eight
at one point, and scored just 12 sec-
onds into the fourth quarter after
winning the draw.
