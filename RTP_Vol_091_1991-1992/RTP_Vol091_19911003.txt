Two women

report

By Cathy Lopiccolo

 

' News Editor

Two women from area colleges
said they were sexually assaulted on
or near the Washington and Lee
campus during the past two weeks.

Neither of the women goes to
W&L, Dean of Students David Howi-
son said, nor has either woman iden-
tified her assailant as being from
W&L.

The first assault occured on the
weekend of Sept. 20-21, Howison
said.

“Our security guards found a
disoriented woman outside Gaines
Hall,’’ Howison said. ‘‘After talking
to her further, the woman indicated
that she had been sexually assaulted
by a man.”’

* Director of Security Michael

, Young said it isn’t clear why the

woman was walking on the W&L

' campus.

The second assault took place
about 4 a.m. Sunday. Howison said

» a young woman was walking between

Sweet Things and Red Square —
where she had been attending a

; party — when she was attacked by

two men and was raped.
Both women were treated at

, Stonewall Jackson Hospital and re-

description of her assailant, but

assaulted near Gaines Hall knew her
attacker.

As of Wednesday, Lexington
Police Chief B. M. Beard would not
comment on whether his department
is investigating the incidents.

Beard said neither woman has
pressed criminal charges.

‘“‘T want students to know they
should definitely report any similar
incidents to the police,’’ Beard said.

Howison and Young emphasized
that women must be careful while
walking alone.

“Our students must understand
that as wonderful as W&L and Lexi-
ngton are, they need to use common
sense and be careful,’’ Howison said.

Students must be especially care-
ful during the evening and early
morning hours, Howison said. Walk-
ing around alone or intoxicated puts
a woman at added risk, he said.

“If a student for any reason is
uncomfortable, she shouldn’t hesitate
to call our security or the Lexington
police,’’ Howison said. ‘‘It’s better
to err by being over sensitive and
careful.”’

W&L security (463-8498) is
available 24 hours a day and will
drive students home if asked,
Howison said. The Lexington police
phone number is 463-2112.

While Howison said he is pleased
with W&L security, he said he would
like to know student opinions on
additional safety measures, like emer-
gency whistles or better lighting.

“I’m open to any ideas to make
W&L a safer place,’’ Howison said.
‘But awareness and common sense
are some of the most important ele-
ments of safety.’’

SCC follows |

simpler

By Thomas Eisenhauer
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Student Conduct Committee
will follow a simpler and more direct
constitution this year, according to
Dean of Students David Howison.

Howison said the revisions, writ-
ten by the Student Affairs Com-
mittee, were designed to make the
SCC more open and responsible to
the student body.

“*The assessment of SAC was that
overall, students did not understand
the student conduct procedures out-
side the Honor System,’’ Howison
said. This year ‘‘we’re giving the
SCC greater authority.”’

Under the new constitution, the
student body will choose the SCC
chairman in a ‘‘Big Four’’ election
during winter term. That election
will replace the usual ‘‘Big Three’’
election of the Executive Committee
president, vice president, and secre-
tary.

Also, the SCC will release the re-
sults of all its cases, though it will
not reveal names.

Additionally, the Student Affairs
Committee will no longer review
SCC decisions. Instead, a Board of
Appeals now has the power to review
but not overturn SCC decisions. The
board, if it chooses to accept an ap-
peal, can send a case back to the
SCC with commentary for recon-
sideration.

The board includes the dean of
students, Howison; the president of
the EC, Giles Perkins; and the senior
faculty member of the SAC, Profes-
sor Robert de Maria.

The new constitution eliminates
previous distinction between major
and minor offense categories. It also
does away with law school advocates
for the parties involved and replaces
them with advisors.

SCC Chairman Christopher Ha-
ley, 92, said the position of advocate
was abolished to make hearings less
antagonistic and more informal. Ad-
visors, who will be appointed by the
SCC, will counsel those involved in
a case but will not speak in SCC
hearings.

‘Advocates were third-year law
students who came in and turned the

   

rules

SCC into a court room,’’ Haley said.
‘I think we'll be able to get to the
truth a lot easier [now].’’

The review was triggered by the
SCC’s inadequate response to two
important cases last year, according
to Howison. He said SAC felt the
SCC did not effectively handle the
conflict last year between Sigma Phi
Epsilon and Phi Gamma Delta, and
the bottle-throwing exchange between
a Sigma Alpha Epsilon member and
two Phi Kappa Psi members.

‘The SCC’s relationship to those
issues gave us concern about their
effectiveness,’ Howison said. ‘‘It
was time to look at a system that
some felt was not responsive.’’

SAC drafted the new constitution
in May with input from the EC and

Haley

According to the Student Hand-
book, the SCC exists ‘‘to control
student conduct.’’ The body was
created by the faculty, which claims
responsibility for student conduct.

According to the Handbook, ‘‘The
SCC investigates and acts upon com-
plaints of alleged student misconduct
except for violations of the Honor
System or cases which fall under the
jurisdiction of the Confidential Re-
view Committee.

“Its jurisdiction extends to all
conduct in Lexington and Rockbridge
County, including nearby colleges,
and conduct while engaged in Uni-
versity-related activity,’’ says the
Handbook.

Tear Night
to change,
deans say

By Maureen Levey
Staff Reporter

 

Due to an increased number
of injured and intoxicated stu-
dents during the last weekend of
fraternity Rush, Tear Night will
change next year, Dean of Stu-
dents David Howison said.

‘*Many houses acted in an ir-
responsible and dangerous man-
ner,’’ Howison said. ‘I promise
there will be differences in Tear
Night next year.’’

Associate Dean of Students
Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins warn-
ed members of the IFC at its
Sept.. 24 meeting that previous
Tear Night behavior was juvenile
and unacceptable. He urged
students to behave decently be-
cause of the potential danger of
injuries.

Atkins found instead on Mon-
day morming that many injuries
occurred over the weekend despite
his warnings.

EC slashes requests by $55,000

 

By Greg Patterson
Staff Reporter

 

The Executive Committee tenta-
tively passed its budget Monday after
slashing close to $55,000 from the
requests it received from student

organizations.

Beginning with over $225,000 in
requests, EC members deliberated for
three hours and cut from almost
every organization’s request to pass a
budget of $166,385 plus a Mock
Convention allocation to be deter-
mined later.

The Student Activities Board and
the Student Bar Association took the
biggest cuts. Monday’s session pro-
duced allocations of $49,500 for SAB
and $41,500 for SBA, down from
requests of $62,945 and $47,999
respectively.

While Mock Convention came in
with a request for $20,000, it re-
ceived no money. EC Vice President
Bo Russell said the money for MC
will be allocated on Monday with
funds from last year’s student body
reserve and from the Publications
Board reserve. Russell said MC ‘‘will
possibly obtain $14,000 to $16,000.""

SAB might also get more money,
according to Russell.

‘They won’t get all of what they
asked for, but we want to give them
enough so that they can make a run
at the comedian and movie’’ series

the SAB has planned, Russell said.

Two organizations did not receive
any funding Monday. The EC tabled
a request by the Women’s Basketball
Club, pending an inquiry into whether
the Athletic Department should fund
the team.

Funding was denied to the W&L
chapter of the American Civil Liber-
ties Union. The chapter had re-
quested $2,150.

Looking at a budget proposal
which asked for funding for speakers,
open mike debates, stationery and
field trips for members and officers,
second-year law Rep. Jay Sterne said
that ‘‘only the Speak Outs really
benefit the campus.”’

EC President Giles Perkins said
he had a problem funding a group
affiliated with a national organization
and that the ACLU chapter ‘‘should
want our money as little as we want
to give it to them.’’

The question of funding national-
ly-affiliated organizations came up
again a few minutes later with a
debate over the request by Amnesty
International for $965.

The EC has traditionally given the
Amnesty chapter $100 per year to
cover dues to the national organiza-
tion. The chapter also requested $865
for postage and envelopes.

First-year law Rep. Bill Callahan
said the actions of the Amnesty chap-
ter were ‘‘externally focused’’ and
the W&L community did not benefit

from them. He said he did not think
EC money should be sent to a na-
tional organization.

Sterne said he did not think of the
money as being sent ‘‘out’’ to a
national organization since it would
be used to help students beco:ne
aware of ‘‘things outside the borders
of Rockbridge County.’’

EC Secretary Caroline Wight said
that each group requesting money
from the EC ‘‘should be considered
individually’’ and she supported giv-

ing the chapter $100 ‘‘so that they
can exist on this campus.”’

Though Callahan and Kelsey voted
against granting money to the Amnes-
ty chapter, the chapter was granted
$100.

The funds for the EC budget are
drawn from an account of about
$205,000. This year’s student activ-
ities fees contributed $185,000, with
$15,000 left over from last year and
$5,000 coming from the Pub Board
reserve.

No need for CRC

In case you haven’t heard, the Confidential Review
Committee is reviewing the university’s harassment policy
and, presumably, the committee’s own role in student affairs.
There are a lot of reasons you might have missed this news.

First, everyone has been talking about reviewing the
harassment policy for so long, it’s hard to tell when the
review is actually taking place and when it’s just being
talked about.

Second, the review is not actually taking place, at least
not right now. Officials promise the CRC will take up the
issue in two weeks. This is a review, by the way, that the
CRC chairwoman said started last year.

If all this sounds like a bureaucratic manipulation of
events, that’s because it is. In fact, despite all the agoniz-
ing over W&L’s harassment policy that has graced student
publications not to mention wet the appetites of Richmond
newspapers, nothing has been accomplished.

The CRC remains as mysterious and secretive today as
it was four years ago, despite promises from administrators
and student representatives. Moreover, the revisions to the
harassment policy, if they materialize at all, promise to be
a poor reflection of student opinion. The CRC and its
upcoming revisions are nothing but a slap in the face to stu-
dent autonomy.

The administration argues in error that because third-year
law EC Rep. Jeff Kelsey sits on the CRC, the students will
have a voice in the revision. Though we respect Kelsey’s
ability as an elected representative, his voice is far from
sufficient. The CRC members are faculty, administration
and students who are appointed by President Wilson. And
given the principle of student autonomy, the ultimate fate of
the CRC should be in the hands of students chosen by their
peers. An objective, accurate review of the CRC can only be
conducted by an outside group. The notion that the CRC
will review itself is ludicrous.

There is however, little question as to what that fate must
be. There is neither need nor justification for a trying body
like the CRC at Washington and Lee. There is no case the
CRC can try that cannot be properly handled by the Execu-
tive Committee, the Student Conduct Committee, or a court
of law.

The only bodies that currently have expulsion powers in
matters of student conduct are the EC, in instances of honor
violations, and the SCC, in severe cases of misconduct. Both
of these organizations have clearly defined jurisdictions and
procedures. Both operate with the endorsement of students:

For the’ CRC; in contrast, the rules ate much more vague.
The Catalogue says the CRC handles cases of sexual assault
and ethnic, religious or sexual harassment. Sexual assault
cases belong in courts of law. As for harassment, the
university policy in the Handbook defines that very general-
ly. The definition says harassment includes ‘‘any conduct of
an ethnic, racial, religious, or sexual nature... adversely
affecting an individual’s quality of life.’’ That’s broad
enough to easily violate the principle of free speech. Non-
elected officials behind closed doors should not be allowed
to make decisions about student expulsions with that
definition.

The time has come to do something about the CRC. The
university should turn over the review process to the EC, or
at least one student committee appointed by the EC. That
group’s findings should be heeded.

Much diversity but scant brain function:

 

MY VIEW
By Robert G. Holland

The following excerpts are taken from the August
14 edition of the Richmond Times-Dispatch and is
reprinted here with permission from the author.

Someone committed a dastardly deed when Vir-
ginians weren't looking... The saboteurs infiltrated
an army of surgeons into university communities
and performed lobotomies on many of the presi-
dents, deans, associate deans and special assistants
to the associate deans.

How else but by the implant of some insidious
electronic device in their noggins can one explain

 

dents exhibit scant intellectual diversity by un-
animously mouthing platitudes about the joy of
being ‘‘different.’’

For example, ‘‘I think diversity is just as

important a part of the preparation for practicing
law as learning substantive law.’’

That is an astounding sentence. It says that all

those who studied law at 242-year-old Washington
and Lee prior to its admitting blacks and women
in recent decades received an inferior education
because they studied entirely in the company of
white males. It also says that students who choose

cians’ lips, while instead comes the repetition at"5-
second intervals, 24 hours a day, of just one word:
‘‘diversity’’... ‘‘diversity’’... ‘‘diversity.”’...

Perhaps we should be grateful that the surrep-
titious surgery did not install a more complex syn-
onym for having many kinds or parts or differen-
ces — ‘‘multifariousness,’’ for example...

But then, multifariousness might be preferable
at that, because it sounds like ‘‘nefarious,’’ which
comes closer to the sinister connotation that be-
nign-sounding diversity has acquired in the politi-
cized academy. The average Joe needs no doctorate
in communications to understand that diversity has
become a code word for the use of racial or
gender preferences to gerrymander the composition
of student bodies or work forces.

A noteworthy invocation of the Magic Word
may be found in the annual ‘‘Dean’s Report’ from

Tear Night story
discouraging

To the Editor:

I was more than mildly disappointed by the
tone of your article on Tear Night in the issue of
September 26. By characterizing drunkenness,
risky if not perilous activities, and ‘‘wreaking
havoc everywhere’ as something to be antici-
pated above all else by freshmen, you encourage
your friends and peers to break the law, to
endanger themselves, and to ignore all sense of
decency and consideration for others — students,
faculty and staff, and townspeople alike.

Just look at the language you use — “a
crazy time,’’ ‘‘a lot of fun,’’ (twice) ‘‘beginning
of a lifetime of brotherhood,’’ ‘‘exciting,’’ and
attracting the attention of lots of women who
‘talways notice the men who tear.’’ Is this the
current student generation’s understanding of
Lee’s standard of comportment to which you so
proudly subscribe?

It appears that President Wilson's convocation
plea to the seniors to take seriously their respon-
sibilities of introducing the freshmen to ‘‘us’’
was either missed or completely ignored, by the
seniors and by The Ring-tum Phi. In the future,
please take the high ground and leave the corrup-
tion of new community citizens to a less influen-
tial group.

Sincerely,
Scott Dittman

Defending E-halls,

To the Editor:
After reading your editorial in last week’s
Phi, | was offended by the suggestion that the

 

‘racial or gender preferences

composition of student
bodies.

to study at schools that remain basically homogen-
ous — predominantly black Howard University’s
law school, for instance — are being ill-prepared
to practice law.

It says that the ethnic background or sex of

one’s classmates is just as important as delving
deeply into Blackstone’s Commentaries or The
Federalist Papers. That is an idiotic premise...

Evidently, discriminating in law-school admis-

sions for diversity’s sake is peachy keen. The
diversity article concedes that it would be ‘‘naive’’
to think that ‘‘ethnic differences have nothing to
do with admissions decisions,’’ and the good dean
argues himself for the setting aside of Law School
Admission Tests when necessary for The Cause.

 

LETTERS

university’s experimentation with an environmen-
tal hall, or even that a preorientation program for
minorities and international students, was segrega-
tion.

In defense of the Preorientation program, it
does bring together traditionally segregated
groups for a few extra days to adjust to life at
W&L before everybody else gets here. Consider-
ing that a majority of these students have never
stepped foot on this campus before, and will be
the first trip to the U.S. for some, why not let
them have an extra day or two to learn their way
around before tossing them in with 400 other
freshmen where it’s easy for anyone to feel lost,
especially if English isn’t your native tongue.

The university’s brief experiment with an
environmental hall for the freshmen was a wel-
comed change, simply because it gave a few
freshmen a chance to live with people that shared
their same interests. Unlike most universities, all
W&L asks on the dorm application is if you
smoke or not. There is no opportunity to match
people with similar interests, leaving quite a few
freshmen feeling isolated by the time rush is
over. This experimentation at least allowed a few
freshmen an opportunity to meet people they
shared a common interest with, in a way like a
greek-letter organization. Both these programs
had good results and will be missed by many on
campus, especially in years to come.

who has more than once made Washington and

alleys, or cloak and dagger schemes to ruin the
‘‘patch of grass’’ beside Tucker Hall.

I would also like to direct attention to the
comment in Mr. Chapman’s letter (issue of
September 26) that the Reeves Center and its
future addition are of ‘‘no educational value’ to
the university. Had Mr. Chapman ever been
inside the Reeves Center, or more closely ex-
amined the proposed usage of the new building,
he would have seen how grossly he has erred in
his judgement. The existing building is host to a
plethora of educational activities — weekly lec-
tures on the decorative and fine arts, various
student research projects, not to mention the
dozens of East Asian studies and fine arts stu-
dents who have attended classes in the center,
Perhaps this information will place the ‘‘educa-
tional value’ of the Reeves Center in proper
perspective.

Ultimately, the purpose of the addition of the
Watson Pavilion is not to needlessly spend
student dollars. As I've previously noted, the
money has been (extremely generously) provided.
Nor is it to depredate our beloved Hill. Rather,
it is to expand the university’s collection of fine
art and give to it the educational and cultural
diversity that it so desperately needs.

Sincerely,

Low ranking ‘won’t hurt’ Plans for

W&L’s fall.

Washington and Lee's seven-posi-
‘tion drop in U.S. News and World
Report's colleges rankings will not
hurt W&L’s reputation, said Dan
Murphy, associate director of admis-
sions,

“I doubt that the slight drop we
\experienced will have  signifigant
|impact,”’ Murphy said. ‘As long as
we're appearing in the top 25 — as
lone of the elite liberal arts schools in
the country — we’re in good shape.”’

The magazine named W&L the
| 22nd-best national liberal arts college
jin its fifth annual guide to ‘‘Amer-
jica’s Best Colleges.’’ Last year W&L
was 15th.

Dr. Thomas Litzenburg Jr., '57,

assistant to the university president,
system and found nothing to explain

“It’s hard to see much of a pat-
the movement of schools
inside the top 25,’ Litzenburg said.
‘*Movement inside the group is of no
great statistical significance.”’

Despite the drop, W&L kept its
title as the ‘Best Buy’’ in its cate-
gory. W&L is the least expensive of
the top 25 liberal arts schools.

And this is the more significant
ranking, said Director of Communica-
tions Brian Shaw.

‘*We remain the ‘Best Buy’ in the
country, and that is very positive,”
Shaw said. ‘‘We’ve gotten a lot of
good press coverage out of it.’’

Dean of Students David Howison
agreed with Shaw.

“The important thing is staying
the ‘Best Buy’ among national liberal
arts colleges,’’ Howison said.

The overall rankings compare 140
national liberal arts colleges on the
basis of academic reputation, selec-
tivity, faculty-resources, total financial
resources and student satisfaction.

Many students were surprised by
W&L’s low student satisfaction rat-
ing. But University Registrar Scott
Dittman explained that the magazine’s
computation method, which used the
percentage of freshmen from 1983-
1985 graduating within five years,
does not fit W&L. He said W&L’s

IM Office says play by’the' rules.

 

By Rick Peltz
Editor

 

Fraternities playing intramural sports at Washington
and Lee will face penalties this year if they do not play
by the rules.

IM Student Director Courtney Penn said the IM office
is cracking down on rules violations it overlooked in the

ast.
r The most common offenses, Penn said, are late rosters
_ and forfeitures.

‘‘We were kind of slack,’’ Penn said. ‘‘If rosters

weren't in on time, well, that was okay. But this year we
_Teally don’t have time for all the goof-ups.’’

Penn said the office will not accept late rosters and
will impose penalties for forfeitures, which are automatic
if a team is not ready to play within 10 minutes of the
scheduled time.

The first forfeiture for a team will cost them eligibility
for the playoffs in that sport, according to the IM rules

‘ pamphlet. The second forfeiture brings a $10 fine, and

subsequent offenses cost $20 each.

Phi Kappa Sigma IM Chairman John McNeer said he
likes the new enforcement policy.

‘When we play small houses they don’t show up,”’
McNeer said. ‘‘It’ll be a lot more competitive if they
have to show.”

Monty Montcrief, IM chairman for Lambda Chi Alpha,
said he also likes the new policy, but he has some
reservations about how teams are grouped.

The new policy ‘‘is good, because it will make it a lot
fairer in some respects,’’ Montcrief said.

But the way houses are scheduled to play each other
seems to pit large houses against small houses early in
each season, he said.

Montcrief said the games would be more exciting if
smaller houses played smaller houses and larger played
larger in the first matches for each sport.

One advantage to rules enforcement, Montcrief said,
is that fraternities will not have an ‘‘anything-to-win
mentality,’’ because everyone will be governed by univer-
sally enforced rules.

“*You just go out there to have fun,’’ he said.

houses
approved

The Lexington Planning Commis-
sion last Thursday approved Washing-
ton and Lee’s site plan to build two
fraternity houses in Davidson Park.

The plan will add Sigma Chi and
Sigma Phi Epsilon to the five houses
already occupying the park. The new
buildings are part of Phase Three of
the university’s Fraternity Renaissance
program.

‘We are serving everybody's best
interests in building the new houses,”’
University Coordinator of Capital
Planning Frank Parsons told The
Ring-tum Phi two weeks ago.

The sight plan must win final ap-
proval by the Lexington City Coun-
cil tonight, but Councilman Brian
Shaw has said they rarely overturn
Planning Commission decisions.

The university decided to build
the houses because it would cost
more to renovate the two current
fraternity houses. Renovating the
current houses also would not allow
for separate party facilities, one of
the Renaissance’s goals.

Renovation of SPE’s house would
also require a conditional use permit
from the city, and the fraternity’s past
problems with its neighbors may have
stood in the way of approval.

The two new houses will be built
on the empty field west of the newly

| renovated Kappa Sigma house on

Nelson Street between Estill and
Randolph Streets. A basketball court
will be built between the two new
houses for use by all the Davidson
Park fraternities.

“‘Washington and Lee is very
deficient in informal recreational
spaces,’ Atkins said. ‘‘Fraternity
students are perceived as they are
because they are only seen listening
to loud music and drinking beer. But
until now, there have been no open
spaces where they can do other thi-
ngs.”’

Commissioner Sidney Brown has
opposed the court in the past and ef-
fectively argued against such a pro-
posal last year when it was included
in the site plan for the Red Square
fraternity houses on Henry Street.

. “While I'd’ prefer a site plan.
‘without ‘a’ ‘basketball court; Pm will’
‘ing ‘to compromise,’’ Brown said.

When the university first brought
the plan to the commission last sum-
mer, the panel requested that Parsons
find a way to shield the court from
view and limit the noise traveling
across Nelson Street.

At the commission’s request, Par-
sons included deciduous trees lining
Nelson Street in the site plan, but
doubted if the trees would survive in
the area’s rocky terrain.

The Planning Commission agreed
to approve the plan unconditionally if
the university would voluntarily
retum with an update of its efforts in
about six months.

“If a problem evolves, W&L will
try to be responsible about it, as we
have on other issues. Our record is
quite good,’’ Parsons said after the
meeting.

Gone With the Wind sequel blows into town

 

By Jennifer Latham
Staff Reporter

 

** IU think of it all tomorrow...’

Those famous words uttered by
Gone With the Wind heroine Katie
Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy
Butler may have come to mind for
Alexandra Ripley, who penned the
epic’s recently released sequel.

The sequel to the story written by
Margaret Mitchell, is entitled Scarlett
and has been available in book stores
for more than a week. Despite high
sales, the book has been deemed a
disapointment at best by many critics
and loyal GWTW fans.

Most published critics have agreed
the sequel, which one Washington
Post writer called a ‘‘bodice ripper,”’
does not parallel the original work
and predicted buyers would net pur-
chase the book with great expec-
tations.

Lexington’s two main book stores
The Best Seller and The Bookery LTD
received the book September 25. So
far, the two stores combined have
sold more than 65 copies of the more
than 800-page book.

Shirley Scott, who works at The
Best Seller, said the store has already
receieved feed-back from two readers
who liked it a lot.

‘One customer said it was nice to
be reacquainted with with the charac-
ters,’’ Scott said.

W&L Senior Pamela Kelley
finished the book four days after its
release. Her impression was not as
favorable.

‘The first thing I wanted to do
was pick up the first one and read it
again, so I could wipe the sequel out
of my mind,’’she said.

Kelley said she mainly wanted to
find out if and how Scarlett got her
husband back. She said she disliked
the novel and many times was
tempted to skip most of it and read
the last few pages to find out if the
two reunite.

“I almost regret reading it,’’ she
said, ‘‘but the temptation is there,
and if your a fan of GWTW, you
can’t help being curious about its

sequel.”’
Jeanette Baggs of Lexington, who

has not yet finished the sequel, called
it ‘‘strictly a romance’.

Like Kelley, she recommended
GWITW enthusiasts read Scarlett, not
for its literary value, but to satisfy
curiosity.

Baggs said she thought a writer
other than Alexandra Ripley might
have done a better job.

Ripley was chosen by a commit-
tee of lawyers for Mitchell’s heirs.
The family reportedly decided to
allow a sequel before the patent on
the original expires in 2011, while
members could control its creation
and the profits it would generate.

According to Life magazine Ripley
was chosen from dozens of authors,
one of whom claimed she was Mar-
garet Mitchell incarnate. Ripley, a
Charleston native appealed to
publishers because of her successes
with southern historical novels like

One Leaving Charleston and New

Orleans Legacy.

The sequel where its predecessor
left off more than fifty years ago. The
year is 1873 and 28 year-old Scar-
lett, the novel’s manipulative, spirited
protagonist, and the tomorrow she
refused to think about has arrived.

Scarlett has just been abandoned
by her husband Rhett Butler, who
utters some of the most famous
words in literary history: ‘‘My dear,
I don’t give a damn.’’ (Frankly was
added in the movie.)

According to Kelley and Baggs,
the book centers on Scarlett’s day to
day activities and her obsession with
getting Rhett back. Scarlett retreats
briefly to her homeplace Tara, then
follows Rhett to his hometown, Char-
leston, South Carolina and a string of
misunderstandings and missed oppor-
tunities ensue.

The bulk of the novel takes place
in Charleston or Savannah, Georgia
and Ireland, where Scarlett journies to
meet her relatives.

According to published interviews
with Ripley, the authoress decided to
emulate Mitchell’s writing style and
further develop some of her charac-
ters through the first part of the
book.

The second half, which introduces
a slew of Scarlett’s relatives and
many new characters in Ireland, and
is more economically oriented, ‘‘is

more my _ book,’’she told The
Washington Post.

In the same interview Ripley said
she did this in part because ‘‘it was
the dullest time in the history of the
United States,’’ with the exception of
what was called the post-Civil War
economic ‘‘Panic.’’ She said that led
her to set most of the story in
Ireland, where Scarlett’s family
emigrated from and there was a lot
of political unrest.

Kelley and Baggs pointed out
what they thought were several points
of interest in the novel: Scarlett’s
childhood nanny, Mammy, dies. Scar-

Boswell published in Playboy

Visiting instructor's fiction article is published in magazine’s October issue

 

By Joyce Bautista
Staff Reporter

 

“‘What was the big deal?... It's
like I've been in restaurants or what-
ever and a woman will walk in, and
from out of nowhere thes little voice
will say, ‘| wonder what she looks
like naked.’ You know the voice I'm
talking about? It's the same one that
Says, ‘I wish I had a million dollars,’
or, ‘I'd like to punch this guy in the
leeth.’ "’

--from ‘‘Bottoms Up”’

Here’s another wish: Imagine you
are a finalist in a writing contest
sponsored by Playboy magazine.

Pictures that may come to mind
are those of scantily clad women
named Bambi hovering over you as
you relax with an alcoholic beverage
by Hugh’s (you and Mr. Hefner are
on a first name basis of course)
refreshing pool.

Marshall Boswell, a visiting in-
structor and 1988 Washington and
Lee alumnus, came closer than most
to that vision almost five years ago,
when he won third place in the
magazine's annual College Fiction
Contest. :

His story, entitled ‘‘Object Per-
manence’’ did not make it into

Playboy, although it was published i.
the 1987 issue of W&L’s literary
magazine, Ariel.

The piece deals with a teenager
named Michael Baker who has a
crush on a girl in his psychology
class, Boswell said. She takes him to
a new wave club and then she dumps
him for an old boyfriend.

Contrary to many of his fricnds’
expectations, Boswell’s reward for
“‘Object Permanence’’ didn’t involve
any string bikinis, but it probably
opened up at least one opportunity
the suits couldn’t.

Although that story never graced
the pages of Playboy, the magazine’s
November issue will feature another
piece by Boswell.

‘Bottoms Up,’’ according to
Playboy, is about a college graduate
who gets a new kind of education
from the street-wise strippers who
happen to be his next-door neighbors.

Boswell’s ‘‘appearance as a
‘regular’ contributor (rather than as a
student) marks our first buy from a
former contestant,’ said Playboy.

According to Boswell, his latest
published work from two real live
strippers who actually did live next
door to him.

‘They were hilarious," Boswell
said. ‘‘After going over and talking
to them, I would rush back to my

Boswell is teaching two sections
of English 105 and a creative writing

‘course at W&L, as part of an inter-

nship for his doctorate. He is also
currently working on a novel en-
titled, ‘‘Falling and Ascending
Bodies.’’

“It’s a romantic comedy,’’ he
said.

‘‘The division between writing and
teaching is not so great,’’ Boswell
explained.

“Teaching freshmen writing
teaches me about writing. I constant-
ly leam new _ things in the
classroom,’’ he said.

Writing Center opens soon in Payne

 

By Ann Knop
Staff Reporter

 

The university will soon open a
new Writing’Center in Payne Hall.

The center, which opens October
15, will be available to students who
want to tighten up their penmanship,
as well as those who have real dif-
ficulties drafting their papers.

Tutors will be available in the
center 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. Tuesday
through Thursday.

According to Professor George
Ray, acting head of the English de-
partment, the center will be an
upgraded version of the university’s
existing writing lab with student

  

tutors.

Assistant Professor and Writing
Center Director Kary Smout, says its
tutors will no longer just proof-read
or edit papers for students, but try to
teach them how to improve thier
writing.

Smout hopes to bring in tutors
who enjoy writing and have a var-
iety of backgrounds.

‘‘We want people who are aware
of other kinds of writing outside of
English,’’ said Smout.

Tutors will attend weekly training
sessions to help them counsel stu-
dents more effectively.

The change in the tutoring
program is part of a new Writing
Across the Curriculum program,
designed to help professors teach

writing.

Ray said that the university over-
all is ‘‘doing a fairly decent job, but
could do better, in the amount, types
and quality of writing.’’

“This Writing Center will
gradually grow as we see how many
students are coming,’’ said Smout.

Senior Chris Swann, who tutored
at the Writing Center last year, said
‘“‘people in every department are
going to need help in writing. I just
hope that people come to use the
Writing Center. It’s a great asset to
the school.’’

Students may sign up for appoint-
ments on the bulletin board outside
of the center.

Professors may also refer students
to the lab with notes to specify the

“Our policy is to have a friend
“stay with an intoxicated person,”’
* Asbury said.

= ‘‘A lot of these friends have been
“drinking themselves and don’t want
‘to stay.””

; Students are often left for the
‘nurses in the Infirmary to monitor.

Asbury said that at one point Friday
night she was admitting two students,
working on one student, and taking
calls from Stonewall Jackson.

Associate Dean of Students Anne
Schroer-Lamont said drunks often
need medical help.

‘‘But what an awful burden to put

on one night nurse,”’ she said.

Dean of Students David L. Howi-
son agreed.

“The purpose of the Infirmary is
to care for those who need help,’’ he
said. ‘‘Certainly weekends like tear
weekend test the limits of the Infir-
mary personnel.’’

Howison said that last weekend’s
_activities are not something in which
» students can take pride.

IFC President Greg Hicks said
“Tear Night was ‘“‘ridiculous,’’ espe-
cially because of the complaints from
Stonewall Jackson Hospital's emer-

gency room.

“If a real emergency had come in
there with all those drunk people,
who knows what would have hap-
pened,’’ Hicks said.

Atkins told the IFC about the
situation with intoxicated students in
the emergency room.

“Think of how you're going to
feel if some local man dies of a heart
attack in the emergency room because
the staff is busy with a bunch of
drunks,’’ Atkins said. ‘‘There’s noth-
ing they can do at the hospital that
will cure immaturity, stupidness and
drunkenness.”’

Atkins said that fraternities should
feel responsibility for the students’

injuries this weekend.

“You ought to feel some respon-
sibility whether or not it occurred at
your house,’’ Atkins said.

Hicks said he is concerned about
the future of Tear Night if problems
continue.

‘‘We might have to go to a for-
mal Tear Night with a coat and tie,”’
Hicks said.

Student opinion of this year’s
Tear Night was generally positive,
but many students expressed concern
about the dangers and injuries.

“‘T thought it was cool, but that’s
only because | didn’t participate in
any of the things I could have gotten
hurt at,’’ freshman Megan Talbott
said.

Junior Susie Wootton said, ‘‘I
wish there was another way of having
Tear Night without anyone getting
injured.’’

Freshman Jamie Cann was one of
those injured.

Howison said, ‘‘Tear Night is be-

The IFC also reminded repre-
sentatives that pledgeship does not

‘“‘No clean ups, no study halls. I

Hicks said. ‘‘If we mess up, we'll

Health Committee
plans programs

 

By Jennifer i“
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee’s Health
Education Committee plans to address
topics such as alcohol and drug
abuse, sexual decision-making and
healthy eating through a variety of

programs this year, according to
Associate Dean Anne _ Schorer-
Lamont.

“Tt is essentially a student or-
ganized program,’’ Schorer-Lamont
says. ‘‘Aside from the money that the
university provides as a budget, the
students make the decisions on which
programs and speakers that they will
pursue.”

The committee has used their
$11,000 budget in previous years for
programs such as Alcohol Awareness
week, Substance Abuse week, Sex
Education week, and a heart-related
health program.

Last year W&L hired Jan Kauf-
man, a health educator from Duke, to
work part-time with the committee.

According to Schorer-Lamont, this
year, committee members and peer
counselors will be trained to present
health programs in the freshmen
dorms.

The committee also plans to ex-
iend Alcohol Awareness to a one
month study. They will be sponsor-

Phi. Kapps aid
special olympians

 

From staff reports

 

Area Special Olympians got a
little practice help from members of
the Phi Kappa Sigma House Wednes-
day.

The Phi Kapps hosted nine play-
ers from the Buena Vista and Rock-
bridge County Special Olympic Vol-
leyball Team for a few games in the
Phi Kapp volleyball pit.

The leader of the Special Olympic

team said she called the Phi Kapps
and asked if they would play the
team because the team needed some
competition to prepare for the upcom-
ing state Special Olympics.

The team practices about two
hours a week and last year won a
gold medal at the state tournament.

She said the Special Olympics are
a non-profit organization providing a
forum for competition for mentally
handicapped people. The organization
is non-profit and ‘‘always looking for
volunteers to help,’’ she said.

 

ing a suicide teleconference in col-
laboration with 300 other campuses
later this month, which will include a
panel of doctors and students talking
about signs of suicide.

In November they plan to bring to
campus the Offstage Theatre from
Charlottesville to present ‘*But I Said
No,”’ a play about acquaintance rape,

Schorer-Lamont says that their
budget allows for some interesting
programs and well-known speakers,
but without more student interest and
participation, no amount of money
will be able to educate the com-
munity.

‘‘We can never have enough stu-
dents on the committee. I would like
to see representatives from every
group on campus — greek men and
women, law students, international
students, freshmen and _— upper-
classmen,”’ said Schorer-Lamont.

‘*Health education is available
here at W&L, and with the high
statistics of drinking, drugs, sexually
transmitted diseases and pregnancies
on college campuses, I would hope
that people want to learn the options
and the consequences of their be-
havior,’’ Schorer-Lamont said.

The committee meets every Thurs-
day at 3:00 p.m. in the Arlington
Women’s Center and the whole W&L
community is invited and encouraged
to attend, she said.

Russian
reflects on
coup

By Stacy Bogerty
Staff Reporter

 

 

In August, the world watched as
hard-line members of the Soviet com-
munist party attempted and failed to
overthrow President Mikhail Gor-
bachev.

A young Soviet who saw the coup
attempt is an exchange student at
Washington and Lee, and shared his
views on his nation’s time of uncer-
tainty.

‘‘The coup was like a bad

, parody of a coup ih a novel, but it,

wasn’t funny,’’ said Leo Morozov,
from Ulyanovsk, Russia.

“It was like everything stopped
in one day. I was sure there was
nothing good in our future,’’ said
Morozov.

By August 21, the waiting was
over as Gorbachev and Russian
Republic President Boris Yeltsin
regained control and Soviet republics
called for independence.

‘‘These changes should have been
done a long time ago,’’ Morozov
said.

However, Morozov said he is
optimistic about the future. When
asked about the direction the Soviet
Union is taking, he said, ‘‘The right
one.’’

Cross country gets
faster by the week

 

By Jacob Kimball
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee women’s
cross country team followed up last
weekend’s impressive opening act
with another respectable showing at
the Dickinson Invitational in Carlisle,
Pa.

The Generals finished sixth over-
all against an eight-team field stock-
piled with quality competition.

While the Generals made ‘‘Great
strides as a team,’’ head coach Jim
Phemister also noted that every run-
ner turned in improved personal.

The team was again led by fresh-
man Kim Herring, whose time of
20:61 was good enough to place her
18th overall. Herring improved her
previous week’s time, but she was
not the only one.

personal records.

**That’s our best individual perfor-
mance in two years,’’ said Phemister.

Nicole Casteel joined Herring in
the sub-21 club, finishing second on
the team in 20:59, a personal best.
Also finishing in the team’s top five
places were Teresa Lamey, 21:37;
Sue Deutsch, 22:13; and Brandi
Henderson, 22:41.

The times turned in by Deutsch
and Henderson were personal records,
as was Kari May’s time of 22:56.
Henderson also added to the list of
remarkable individual showings by
slicing more than two minutes off her
previous time against Mary

Generals hard-luck losers AMEE oRHeMontH
Stimeling keeps |

foes out of goal ;

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

If the Washington and Lee foot-
ball team hadn’t had bad luck in
Saturday’s 24-7 loss to Centre Col-
lege, it wouldn’t have had any.

That would have satisfied head
coach Gary Fallon just fine.

In the first quarter, W&L’s Bob
Ehret hit a punt that appeared to roll
out of bounds inside the Centre 1-
yard line, but the officials ruled the
ball hit in the end zone.

In the second quarter, W&L
‘couldn’t field a kickoff because a
short kick took a bad bounce and
Centre recovered.

After gaining momentum in the
second half, a receiver is hit while
catching a pass and the ball ends up
in a Centre defenders arms for an
interception.

’ “The kickoff and the punt call
.were bad breaks, but we can’t make
excuses for the loss,’’ said Fallon.

It was the second quarter that did
the Generals in. Centre ran 30 plays
in the quarter to W&L’s 10, keeping
the W&L defense on the field for
‘6:33 in a row and 10:17 all told.

The Colonels scored on a 27-yard
pass from Jeff Ratanapool to Eric
Horstmeyer and then, after recovering
the bad-bounce kickoff, on a 1-yard

‘run by Tim McDaniel to take a 17-
0 lead into halftime.

‘‘We didn’t get much going in the
first half,’’ said Fallon. ‘‘We dropped
some passes that hurt us, and we
never threatened them.”

At the half, W&L had managed

 

 

 

Jon Orndorff
..9 tackles & fumble

just one first down and 19 yards of
total offense.

In the second half, W&L started
strong. After the defense forced the
Colonels to kick after three plays, the
offense took over.

Senior quarterback Fred Renneker
engineered the most impressive drive
of the season, taking the Generals 70
yards in 13 plays. Junior Wade Rob-
inett capped the drive with a touch-
down dive from two-yards out.

On the drive, junior Mark Goglia
carried for 23 yards on three carrie.,
and Renneker hit seniors George
Sakin and Jeff Kreis and freshman
William Probst with key completion
before Robinett scored the touch-
down to cut Centre’s lead to 17-7.

Given new life, the defense held
again, and the Generals got the ball
back after a punt on the Centre 49.

Then disaster struck. On second
down, Renneker’s pass was knocked
loose from Sakin and intercepted by

 

   

Lyle Smith

18 tackles
Centre.
‘We got things together early in
the second half,’’ said Fallon.

“Everything was clicking. Our offen-
sive line was firing out and moving
people off the line. We were getting
big completions, and then the air
came out after we tumed it over.”’

After the interception, W&L never
crossed midfield again, getting only
as far as its own 32.

Centre used a ball-control offense,
led by All-American tailback Tim
McDaniel, to run out the clock. In
the second half, McDaniel carried 17
times for 57 yards and a touchdown.
The touchdown came in the fourth
quarter with 2:19 remaining against a
defense that spend 36 minutes on the
field.

“If we had put another drive
together in the second half, we would
have gained confidence and made
them worry,”’ said Fallon. ‘‘It would
have made them wonder if they could

“It was the greatest team. perfor-
mance since I have been here.’’
That’s how Washington and Lee
men’s cross country coach John Tuc-
ker enthusiastically reflected upon the
Generals’ strong showing at the Dick-
inson Invitational last weekend.

Led by junior Bo Hannah, W&L
placed third out of five very tough
teams that included nationally-ranked
nemesis Mary Washington College.

Hannah stayed near the front of a
field of highly competitive runners
and finished second overall, only
fourteen seconds off the pace. He
finished in 26:10.

Hannah was not alone as a top
overall finisher. He was joined by
ever-consistent senior co-captain

Charles Edwards, who recorded a
personal best of 26:28 to place him
fifth overall and second on the team.

For the second straight meet,
Matthew Brock came in third for the
Generals. His personal best of 27:01
placed him eleventh overall. Brock
showed considerable improvement as
he finished ahead of three MWC run-
ners that finished ahead of him the
week before.

Senior David Phillips also posted
a personal record time of 27:47.
That put him just ahead of W&L’s
fifth finisher, junior Keith Rinn,
whose time was a career best of
28:02.

Eight of the 12 W&L runners
tumed in personal records as the
team showed it is solid from top to
bottom. Rounding out the top eight
are senior co-captain Lee Parker,
freshman Doug Boyles, senior Frank

Martien, sophomore Matthew McCol-
lum and freshman Larry Hautau.

Messiah ran away from the field
to win the Invitational, Messiah fin-
ished with 26 points, Mary Wash-
ington 55 and W&L 62.

The Generals continue to gain on
regional power Mary Washington.
The Eagles, ranked 18th in the nation
and defending regional champs, did
not have a runner finish ahead of
either Hannah or Edwards.

The Generals plan on continuing
to ride this wave of improvement as
they host Shepperd and Roanoke in
this Saturday’s 12:00 tri-meet. This
contest pits them against an Old
Dominion Athletic Conference rival in
Roanoke, and thus should be a bar-
ometer for the team as they ready
themselves for a run at the ODAC
title.

Depth, defense lifts women’s

soccer in two to

 

By Sarah Gilbert
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee women’s
soccer team earned two key Old
Dominion Athletic Conference wins
last week to run its record to an
impressive 4-2, 4-1 in the ODAC.

On Tuesday at Randolph-Macon,
the Generals went down to the wire,
winning 1-0 in overtime on a goal by
senior Morgan Warner.

“It was a really tough win,’’ said
head coach Janine Hathorn, ‘‘Ran-
dolph-Macon is always a very physi-
cal and hard-played game.”’

Not only was Warner a star, but
the entire bench got Hathorn’s atten-
tion with its effort.

“The bench is what makes us
good. They are really solid, and they
always play really well,’’ said
Hathom. ‘‘Any of the substitutes
could be a starter on other teams.
We have a lot of depth and — one
more time — this is the reason why
we won our game,”’

Though the Generals faltered in
the first half of Saturday’s game at
Guilford, they held on in the second
period to shut out the Quakers, 2-0.

Sophomores Angie Carrington and
Corinda Hankins provided the game’s
only goals. Hankins chalked up the
first off a corner kick and a goalie
error, and Carrington was successful
in a breakaway for the second.

“It was a really good game,”’
said Hathorn. ‘‘It wasn’t a really
great first half, but we pretty much
dominated from the beginning of the
second half, and were by far the best
team.”

She felt this game was a turning
point for her team.

us. We were involved in a very close
game, and finally were able to win
in that situation,’’ she said.

‘*We exhibited a lot of poise and
patience. We really did our best job
so far this year of playing a con-
trolled game.”’

Along with Warner and soph-
omore Aspen Yawars, Hathorn was
again pleased with the non-starters.

‘The bench was critical. That we
have so many players that can main-
tain a certain level of play is really
nice,’’ she said.

Having shut out their past three
opponents, the Generals are in good

form to meet a tough Gettysburg
team Saturday at 3:00 p.m.

‘After a big win we've got to
find a way to buckle down and get
back to work. It was a close game
last year, and playing away can add
to the difficulty, so we have a tough
game on our hands,’ Hathorn said.

“‘T just can’t say enough about the
way my team plays together and the
way they work hard and play hard
every minute of the game.”’

Saturday’s game will be played at
Gettysburg.

hang on, but we never got it going
again.”’

On the day, McDaniel gained 100
yards for the third straight time
against W&L, but he earned them,
rushing 37 times for 110 yards.

Goglia led the W&L rushing at-
tack with 43 yards on nine carries,
and freshman Michael MacLane
added 41 yards on eight carries.

Defensively, junior Lyle Smith led
the way with 18 tackles. Seniors Trey
Cox and Scott Williamson had 14
each, and Dave Frankhouser had 13.

Next up for the Generals, 0-3, 0-
1 in the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference, is a trip to take on ODAC
rival Randolph-Macon.

Fallon says his Generals should
have their hands full.

“Offensively, they're never out of
a game because of their passing
game. They throw it all over the
place. They live by the pass, and
they can use it as a ball-control of-
fense. Defensively, it’s like playing
King Kong and his quadruple
brothers. They’re fast and strong and
they flock to the ball.’’

King Kong is former ODAC
Player of the Year Jody Kane, who
missed last year with a knee injury.

Despite the early struggles, Fallon
is optimistic.

“We haven’t given up yet, and
we're not going to,’’ he said. ‘‘May-
be we'll have one of those days
where it all clicks for us. -

‘Nothing can beat the feeling of
a little success coming your way.
We’re hungry and we're hoping for
our first win.’’

W&L drubs
everyone in
state meet

The Washington and Lee water
polo team ran away with the title in
Virginia State Championships this
past weekend at Twombly Pool, but
the Generals are keeping their success
in perspective.

Despite resounding victories over
rivals James Madison, Lynchburg,
Virginia Tech and Hampden-Sydney,
the team must now face the toughest
part of their schedule,

According to W&L head coach
Page Remillard, ‘‘We played a dif-
ferent caliber of teams this past
weekend than we had at the Eastern
Water Polo Association [tournament]
in Annapolis two weekends ago.’’

Though the Generals were heavily
favored to run away with the VSC
title, overconfidence did not detract
from their play on Saturday. The
Generals opened the tournament with
an impressive 14-5 victory over JMU
and followed with victories over
Lynchburg, 19-5, and Va. Tech 22-
3,

“Overall the VSC was a good
tuming point to get back on track
after the EWPA,”’ said junior Chris
Hagge.

After a slow start Sunday in the
championship game against H-SC,
W&L rallied to clinch a 14-4 victory.

Winning aside, Remillard felt that
the player’s mental preparedness was
somewhat lacking. ‘‘After a terrible
warmup and first half against Hamp-
den-Sydney, we loosened up in the
second half to pull away,’’ Remillard
said.

He added, however, that because
of the Generals’ sub-par first half
effort, bench action was limited in
the H-SC game. Senior All-Amer-
icans Alan Herrick and Will Davis
carried the brunt of the scoring
against H-SC with 3 goals and 4
goals, respectively.

On the defensive end, junior
goalie P.J. Waicus had 33 blocks for
the tournament while only allowing
15 goals. Herrick, Waicus, and senior
John Kannapell were voted to the all-
tournament team.

This weekend the Generals will
face the toughest test of the season at
the Southern Polo Conference Tour-
nament to be held in Lexington at
Twombly Pool.

On Friday evening, W&L will
play a crucial match against Dayton
at 8 p.m. followed by matches
against arch-rival Richmond on Satur-
day at 3:30 p.m. and Arkansas-Little
Rock on Sunday at 10:30 a.m.

Remillard said he looks forward
to the challenge of playing stiff com-
petition to see if the players can rise
to the occasion.

Washington and Lee soph-
omore Kate Stimeling came a long
way to go to school at W&L. But
Stimeling has made the most of
her home-away-from-home...away-
from-home.

If her Lexington residence is
her home-away-from-home, then
anchoring the defense as goalie on
the women’s soccer team is her
home-away-from-home-away-from-
home. And she doesn’t like much
company at her home on the field.

Just six games into her soph-
omore season, Stimeling has al-
ready tied the school record for
shutouts in a career with 12 and
has four shutouts already this year.

In six games, Stimeling has
allowed just three goals and regist-
ered 51 saves for a .944 save
percentage in helping lead the
Generals to a 4-2 start.

For her accomplishments,
Stimeling is The Ring-tum Phi
Athlete of the Month for Septem-
ber.

“I’m just focusing on having a
consistent game,’’ she said. ‘‘I’m
getting mentally prepared, and
focusing on making game winning
saves and keeping things to-
gether.”’

Perhaps her greatest ac-
complishment this year was keep-
ing things together in Tuesday’s 1-
0 win over Randolph-Macon. She
turned away 19 shots in the over-
time win.

‘We really came on in the
second half against Macon,’’ she
said of the team’s performance.
“Everyone played their best, and
the adrenaline was there. It was a
sweet win for everyone, but the
seniors especially.”’

Stimeling has been at her best
all season. She has allowed just
one goal in ODAC play, to Vir-
ginia Wesleyan and has not al-
lowed a goal in 340 minutes,
including 120 minutes in the over-
time win against R-MC. Against

Denison in the season opener,
Stimeling recorded 15 saves.

While she stands out in the
goal, Stimeling also can play in
the field, as she showed against
Randolph-Macon Woman’s Col-
lege. After shutting out R-MWC in
the first half, Stimeling played in
the field and scored a goal and
handed out an assist.

“T love playing with my feet
[in the field],’’ she said. ‘‘I miss
it a lot. I got out on the field and
I loved it — but I like playing
keeper too. That’s where I'll play
until we win an ODAC title.’’

That should be a relief to head
coach Jan Hathorn, who looked
long and hard, and far, to find the
goalie that just might bring Hath-
orn’s first Old Dominion Athletic
Conference crown to Lexington.

Kate Stimeling

From San Diego, Ca., Stimel-
ing said she was turned on to
WA&L through some alumni.

“San Diego has an incredible
alumni chapter,’’ she said. ‘‘I
filled out a questionnaire about the
school and it got fed back through
the alumni. ‘It was a small school
in the south with a soccer program
and a good english department.
The alumni sold me on it.”’

And Hathorm and the rest of
the W&L women’s soccer pro-
gram are glad she’s here.

Congratulations to Kate Stime-
ling, The Ring-tum Phi Athlete of
the Month for September.

Men’s soccer boucnes |
back in rout of H-SC

 

By Sean O’Rourke
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee men’s
soccer team was handed its first loss
of the season this past Saturday, and
the Generals weren’t too happy about
it.

National power Bethany College
beat W&L soundly 4-0. The Generals
came back with a vengeance on
Tuesday, though, dominating Old
Dominion Athletic Conference rival
Hampden-Sydney, 3-0.

With the win, W&L’s record
stands at 4-1-2, 2-0-0 in the ODAC.

Head coach Rolf Piranian looked
at the Bethany game in a positive
light. ‘‘No one got hurt,’’ he said.

Still though, he was clearly un-
happy with the loss. ‘‘The kids have
to get back to doing the things
they’re capable of doing. They
didn’t execute, so they just have to
do things better,’’ he said.

Senior tri-captain Jeff Zeiger said
he saw one positive aspect. ‘Bethany
is a good team and they exploited
our weaknesses. We know now what
we have to work on.”’

The Generals obviously worked on
the right things preparing for H-SC.
They dominated play from beginning
to end.

W&L’s first score came 40 min-
utes into the contest as junior Kyle
Fanning took a pass from classmate
Reid Murphy and deposited his shot
into the upper left corner.

Fanning struck again early in the
second half. He took a perfect pass
from freshman Eric Tracy and guided
it into an open goal for a 2-0 lead.

Later in the half, Tracy scored an
unassisted goal from 30 yards out for
the Generals’ final score of the after-
noon.

‘I thought we started off well,’’
said Murphy. ‘‘Usually we need a
few minutes to get into the game."’

Murphy also said that Saturday's
loss helped lead to Tuesday’s win. ‘‘I
think we learned from Saturday's loss
and just went out and played better

today.”

Piranian had a mixed review,
though. ‘‘We played well, but some-
thing was missing. There wasn’t
enough intensity and it wasn’t a very
emotional effort. I saw some im-
provement from Saturday, but Bet-
hany and Hampden-Sydney are two
totally different teams. So we'll have
to see,”’

The H-SC game marked the half-
way point in the regular season for
the Generals, and Piranian likes that
his team is still improving.

“I'd like to have our 11 best
players out there, but we’re still
playing better soccer. However,
there’s still a lot of room for im-
provement. I don’t believe this
team’s played its best soccer yet.'’

 

 

 

 

 

Mike Mitchem

The Generals are still without
junior Mike Mitchem (knee). He con-
tinues to be on a day-to-day basis.
The team might also be without
senior goalie Lee Corbin, who hurt
his foot in the first half of the
Hampden-Sydney game and was
forced to sit out the rest.

The Generals would like both of
these players for Saturday as the
Generals take on ODAC rival Roa-
noke at Liberty Field at 2 p.m.

On Tuesday, the Generals hit the
road for another tough ODAC chal-
lenge at Randolph-Macon, A win in
either of these games would match
the team’s win total of three against
ODAC opponents last year.
