SCC
suspends

Miller

By Jason Kelley
Editor

 

 

Marcus Miller, the senior found
guilty in court of trespassing in a
woman student’s home in August, has
been suspended from Washington and
Lee for the remainder of the school

a year.

+ He was suspended after being
tried by the Student Conduct Com-
mittee for the August trespassing
incident.

Miller was arrested Aug. 6 and

. charged with breaking and entering
and attempted rape, police records
show.

In a plea
bargain agree-
ment reached in
September,
Miller pled
guilty to tres-
passing and
received a one
year suspended
prison sentence,
a $500 fine,
and was or-

dered to serve 50 hours of com-
munity service,

SCC Chairman Chris Haley said
the case was brought before the SCC
by ‘‘someone not directly involved in

{ the incident.’’ :
Haley said any student may bring
i alleged misconduct to the attention of
p  esee

“It is correct that students need
not be directly involved in the case,”’
he said. ‘‘Any member of the student
body may bring a case to the atten-
tion of myself, any member of the
SCC, or the dean of students’ of-
fice,”’

Haley added that some cases have
been referred to the SCC by W&L
security officers.

According to a ‘statement released |

by the SCC, an appeal was filed in
the case but the conviction was up-
held by the SCC’s Board of Appeals,
comprised of Dean of Students David
Howison, Executive Committee Presi-
dent Giles Perkins, and Student Af-
fairs Committee Senior Faculty Mem-
ber Robert deMaria.
According to SCC rules, the ap-
' ,  peals board can either uphold an SCC
: sanction or remand a case back to the
*  $CC with a recommendation for re-
, consideration.

Perkins said he was pleased that
the changes made in SCC procedures
had worked well in this case.

‘‘The new system worked well,
and I applaud the SCC for their

i efforts,’’ he said.

Changes to SCC rules were made
by SAC earlier this year that included
the elimination of law school advo-
cates for parties involved and re-

’ moved the previous distinction bet-
ween major and minor offenses.

The 1991-92 SCC is made up of
the elected presidents and vice presi-
dents of each undergraduate class and
the presidents of the law classes.

Victory over Hoyas averts no-win record

Staff Reporter

 

The Publications Board Monday
approved a format for a new student
news magazine and began accepting
applications for editors and a business
manager.

The monthly news magazine will
include a ‘‘point/counterpoint’’ sec-
tion with opposing opinions about a
selected topic, an editorial section and
at least one in-depth news article,
according to sophomore Matt Jack-
son’s format proposal.

Jackson is a founder and editor of
The Traveller, an independent student
magazine.

Jackson said he does not know if
he will apply for the editorship of the
new magazine.

Jackson said he is also unsure of
The Traveller's future. He said this
week’s issue might be the last.

“I don’t think both [The Traveller
and the new magazine] can coexist,"
Jackson said. ‘‘It will be either the
staff of The Traveller and some peo-
ple from the W&L community work-
ing on the new magazine or everyone
will stay on The Traveller and the
new magazine will fail.’’

The format was approved by a 3-
2 vote. Ariel, Calyx and Journal of
Science voted to adopt the format,
while The Ring-tum Phi and Political
Review voted against it.

view, said a new magazine would be

Che Ring-tum Phi

Founded September 18, 1897

Think before you
vote tonight

In an attempt to sway IFC’s vote in favor of approving
Alpha Phi Alpha, Interfraternity Council President Greg
Hicks moved Tuesday’s vote to tonight.

He seems to hope that given more time to think about
the issue, and given more time to feel guilty about deny-
ing the petition of their fellow students, many fraternity
men might change their minds to the politically correct
opinion favoring Alpha Phi Alpha.

We expect the postponement to have the opposite
effect. Fraternity men will become more frustrated with
the unresolved issue and forget the practiced rhetoric of
Alpha Phi Alpha’s representative, who spoke Monday.

But the facts in the case have not changed. We main-
tain that a vote for Alpha Phi Alpha is a vote to stall
Washington and Lee’s movement toward integration, if not
reverse it.

Alpha Phi Alpha’s presentation Monday was more an
appeal to emotion than logic. There were no new facts.

The student petitioners for the new fraternity argued
two main points: Alpha Phi Alpha will fill an intangible
social need of black students the current fraternity system
does not; and Alpha Phi Alpha is fundamentally different
from other fraternities, primarily in its service orientation.

These arguments are contradictory. While the petitioners
tout Alpha Phi Alpha as different from a social fraternity,
they say they need it to upgrade their social lives.

Contradiction aside, however, the petitioners failed to
allay fears that the Alpha Phi Alpha chapter here will not
further segregate the community. While they began their
arguments by denouncing generalizations like “*black’’ and
‘‘white,’’ in the end they themselves used these terms like
everyone else.

The representative from the fraternity also failed to
shed any new light on the issue.

First of all, he has only visited campus two times since
September, and neither visit was a lengthy one. Accord-
ing to Hicks, he will not return to W&L prior to
Thursday. This lack of involvement raises some doubt
about Alpha Phi Alpha’s commitment to a W&L chapter.

More importantly, his contribution to the discussion
centered on Alpha Phi Alpha’s admirable work with the
Boy Scouts of America and high school students nation-
wide. It gave an impression that voting against Alpha Phi
Alpha would be un-American. Overall, he made a very
good sales pitch. That’s okay; that’s his job.

But while a W&L chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha might
contribute a great deal to the Lexington community, its
effects on the W&L community will not be constructive.
Yes, the IFC would become integrated. But when students
walked out the IFC doors, the black students would go
one way and the white students another.

Black student involvement in the fraternity system,
unheard of 20 years ago, is increasing today. National
fraternities that may be called historically white are na-
tionally overcoming racial separation. At most houses
today, the question is not how to keep black students out,
but how to change to make them feel welcome.

Many fraternity members are undoubtedly reading this
editorial as they sit together at dinner. We urge them to
take this time to consider the facts and let their IFC
representative know what they think. We believe their
consideration will lead them to the difficult decision to
deny the petition for Alpha Phi Alpha. But whatever
decision they make, they should take care to be certain of
their convictions, as there will likely be repercussions
from this vote for many years to come.

I tumed on Headline News the other day
(Cheers wasn’t on yet) and heard that Oral Roberts
has written a letter to one million of his ‘‘closest
followers’’ asking EACH for $500. There is
apparently a ‘‘satanic conspiracy’ against his
congregation: It’s bad enough he HAS one million
followers, but the sad thing is, those dumb saps
who inexplicably love him will probably fall for it
again.

Is the world going completely nuts or is it just
me? Forget evangelists; Judgment Day seems to be
coming. Fires have destroyed about five billion
acres of forest out West this year, playing a recent
engagement in Oakland’s backyard. A ‘‘former’’
Neo-Nazi KKK Grand Dragon nearly won the
governorship of Louisiana, and the guy who finally
did win that election is about as appealing as Ted
Kennedy. And the latest reports say David Duke
wants to run for PRESIDENT in 1992.

And let us not forget that the entire state of
West Virginia was recently on fire and sent a ton
of smoke and soot to good old Lexington. I got
asphyxiated each morning as I walked out of my
apartment. My roommate kept muttering about a
mass exodus of coal miners and inbreeds into the
Shenandoah Valley (actually, I said that, but it’s
more fun to blame my roommate; and West
Virginians, don’t get mad, I live in Georgia). The
ozone hole is expanding, the blue whales are
dying, the Democratic party seems to be getting
organized, and I can’t find my dress socks.

Face it, Armageddon is nigh. Michael Dukakis
is coming to speak for Mock Convention, and I
keep wondering if there is a lost verse in
Revelations about a short Greek presidential wanna-
be visiting Washington and Lee. If that isn’t a sign
of doom, what is? I’d rather see locusts on the
Colonnade.

And speaking of the Colonnade, we might be
getting an addition in the form of a new arts
building. Thanks, guys, why bother giving us
something we really need, like a new computer
room or an expanded research library... or a bar?
Next thing you know, when we all come back in

Spectator cover
insults staff

To the Editor:

Well, we've gotta hand it to the Spectator.
One always expects the worst of them, and they
never fail to deliver. Take the latest cover.
Remember it? The one with the cleaning-lady
bent over her task in some fraternity house, the
words ‘‘Just what are we paying them for any-
way?’’ emblazoned across her face? I know this
letter follows the event rather belatedly; I’m just
now getting over my disbelief. That cover was so
appallingly offensive, it was almost surreal.

At first glance, I was startled. ‘‘Did that lady
give her permission?’’ I instantly wondered. I
mean, it struck me as rather too powerful an
image for a story that was objecting to the
condition of these overworked, underpaid people.
But no. Silly, silly me. The Spectator was not
championing W&L’s dedicated and competent
maintenance staff. No, it was training upon them
its well-tried arsenal of smarmy, whining der-
ision. The cover photo was intended not to invite
sympathy for its subject, but to provoke contempt
for her ever-so-far-beneath-us function at this
university and, unbelievably, outrage at her
arrogantly-implied shiftlessness and greed.

The article to which this photo ‘‘relates’’
concerns the alleged mismanagement of contrac-
tual arrangements for the post-Renaissance main-
tenance of fraternity houses. Possible misdoings
on the administration’s part, and on the part of
upper-level staff at Stonewall Management Ser-
vices, are involved. The character of the latter
firm's lower-level employees is not involved.

 

twenty years, the Colonnade will be painted bright
green, the fraternities will all have become
administration filing cabinets or hold valuable
collections of extremely rare Mongolian silverware,
and John Wilson will still be university president.

On top of all of this chaos, I’ve got to try and
convince myself that Nostradamus was wrong; the
world won't self-destruct in 1997, and I have to
find a job.

Underclassmen, don’t think for a second that
any senior worth his or her GPA wouldn’t switch
with your seemingly-insignificant lives. You see,

I’ve got to convince myself
that Nostradamus was
wrong; the world won’t
self-destruct in 1997, and I
have to find a job.

being interviewed for responsible positions in
society after spending four years in a ‘‘country
club’’ (thanks, Dad) can be a mite stressful. Goals?
I'd be happy to work at East Lex after graduation,
or maybe open a bar (how many of you have has
that dream? Get in line and take a number, I’m
ahead of you).

Back to my roommate, the C-school major (yes,
I know, he must be insane). He tells me horror
stories of interviews by big businesses. They make
the Inquisition sound like a preliminary for the Girl
Scouts of America. Some people supposedly induce
stress into the interview to see how you handle it.
Sounds like some of my teachers.

Anonymous English prof.: ‘‘You really have
NO idea what Milton is saying, do you?”

Grovelling English major: ‘‘No,
Worshipfulness.’’

Abominable Academian: ‘‘I have a collection
of retarded children in my classroom. Western
civilization is doomed. Now why don’t you
paraphrase verses 1-10 for the entire class?’’

Try this on for size: You get in one of your
father’s old suits, even shave for a change, and
head for your first interview at Greedy
Corporation, Inc. The interviewer is the company’s
59-year-old CEO. The room has two chairs, a desk,
and a 1000-watt naked bulb over your chair. You
sit down to discover that the right front chair leg

LETTERS

They are just doing their job, and even the
Spectator, by a miracle of forbearance, does not
suggest that they’re doing it poorly. But it does
include unnecessary, condescending images (on
the cover and on pages 12-13) of these people
hard at work cleaning W&L’s opulent new rich
kids’ clubs. The gratuitous representation of these
images, in a clearly dispataging context, is a
profoundly obnoxious reflection of the Spectator’s
pervasive cheap-shot-taking snottiness. It is an
insult to everyone whose economic status has
them cleaning our halls, whether they work for
Stonewall Management, W&L, or anyone else. I
assure you, Spectator, any money we are being
overcharged for maintenance does not land in the
pockets of these ladies or their co-workers, to all
of whom you owe an apology.

We at Washington and Lee are privileged to
inhabit one of the most unutterably lovely and
impeccably well kept-up college environments in
the world. Don’t the snivelling, cossetted mama’s
boys behind the Spectator have anything better to
do than go out of their way to insult and demean
the hardworking men and women who keep it
that way?

my class at Harvard Law School. What can YOU
offer the company?’’

Is my finding a job, getting married, raising
two-point-seven kids, and slaving away for their
benefit worth all this? Hell no, I said. So, I’m
unemployed. My father also announced that on
June 4, the free ride is over. Swell. As Peter
Benchley said, the Western economy is about to
implode, and I’m broke. I suppose The Washington
Post could pick me up to do a bi-weekly column
(just look how well I’m doing now). Did college
prepare me for the big bad world? Well, my social
skills are certainly down pat. Wouldn’t that look
nice on a resume?

50 percent of last year’s class. Although,
considering who I’d be working for, maybe I
should just become a shoe salesman like Al Bundy
and raise a family of morons on my cwn TV

Plans for the last house to go through Frater-
nity Renaissance passed the Lexington Planning
Commission Nov. 14 after arguments concerning
where residents would park their cars.

W&L will make its final request for the condi-
tional use permit to renovate Delta Tau Delta, at
106 Lee Avenue, to the Lexington City Council
lee. 2:

“I’m happy to move on to the city council,”’
W&L Coordinator of Capital Planning Frank
Parsons said. ‘‘While it’s always good to get past
the planning commission, the city council is likely
to address much the same issues.’’

Making Delt conform to the city’s one bed, one
parking spot rule brought the meeting’s most
intense discussion. Currently, Delt has room for
six parking places on the property, but the renova-
tion plans will lower that number to three.

Delt now holds a non-conforming use permit
exempting it from the parking rule, but the house
must give up that permit before renovations. It will
need 17 additional spaces within 500 feet of the
house to bring it up to code.

In its site plan, the university proposed renovat-
ing the parking lot behind the Chi Psi house, on
the corner of Lee Avenue and Nelson Street, to
accomodate both Delt and Chi Psi parking require-
ments.

However, commission members were concerned
that the proposed plan would require double-load-
ing eight cars into the lot.

In the end, the committee realized double-
loading was not a factor in the decision on Delt.

Vice-Chairman Robert Akins noted the Chi Psi
house, which was formerly an elementary school,
is in a ‘‘commercial’’ zone and is therefore exempt
from the parking rule.

While the university will still expand the Chi
Psi lot, the eight double-loaded spaces will not be
included. Chi Psi will offer all additional parking

¥ Gong
sounds
in GHQ

By Pamela Kelley
Associate Editor

 

 

Washington and Lee’s Kappa
Alpha Theta sorority struck a chord
on campus Wednesday night with its
second annual Gong Show.

More than 200 people crowded
into the General Headquarters for the
show, a fund raiser for Theta’s na-
tional philanthropy and the Rock-
bridge Area Recreation Organization.

The annual fund raiser is a spoof
of a popular 1970s game show with
the same name, in which celebrity
Judges scored acts and sounded a
gong to stop the worst ones.

Most of the Theta show’s 11 acts,
which included lip-synch numbers and
comedy routines, were performed by
fraternity and sorority members.

Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity’s
pledge class won the show’s $100
cash prize, with a rendition of Monty
Python’s ‘‘Lumberjack Song.”’

Seven Chi Psi pledges captured
second place with their portrayal of a
day in the life of Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’
Atkins, W&L associate dean of stu-
dents for Greek affairs.

Third place went to a group of
Phi Kappa Psi fraternity members,
who lip-synched the rap song ‘‘Good
Vibrations’? by Marky Mark and the
Funky Bunch.

Among the other acts, Phi Gam-
ma Delta fraternity members per-
formed a partial strip tease to Jimmy
Buffet’s ‘*Volcano.”’

History Prof. Taylor Sanders,
Assistant Politics Prof. Mark Rush
and Associate Prof. of Romance
Languages Gwen Campbell judged
the competition.

Sanders, who wore a tuxedo, also
performed ‘‘Rawhide’’ a capella for
the crowd.

The show was hosted by Univer-
sity Registrar Scott Dittman, who
posed as an unknown comic until he
was unmasked.

Gong Show Coordinator and Theta
member Denise Brainard said the

 

event raised more than $800 from
ticket sales and the show’s acts.

that Delt needs, and the university will allow Delt
residents to park in the Corral or other designated
student parking areas, Parsons said.

Chi Psi residents will be guaranteed eight
spaces in university parking areas.

In another discussion on Delt, the commission
rejected a Delt neighbor’s request for a brick wall
to separate him from the fraternity house. Instead,
the commission adopted the university’s plan to use
a six-foot cedar fence and hedges to shield the
fraternity house from its neighbor.

1992 FOC picks 25

 

By Rick Peltz
Editor

 

More than 60 students applied for
the 1992 Freshman Orientation Com-
mittee, largely because of this year’s
successful program, FOC Vice Chair-
man Teresa Williams said.

FOC named 25 to its ranks, 10
more than Williams and Chairman
Robert Wilson had planned to name,
Williams said.

‘‘We just had a tremendous inter-
est in FOC,’’ Williams said. ‘‘We
interviewed a lot of people who said,
‘Orientation didn’t seem as much fun
as what the freshmen did this year.’’’

Icebreaker games were the most
talked-about addition to this year’s
orientation program. Freshmen broke
down into small groups in the War-
ner Center, where they played games

like ‘‘Bob, Bob George,’’ a variation
on the children’s game ‘‘Duck, Duck

‘The freshmen may have
complained a lot about the games,”’
Williams said, ‘‘but the [members of
the] class of ’95 know each other
better than classes ahead of them.’’

While icebreakers will be retained,
Williams said other aspects of the
orientation program will be changed,
such as the Freshman Record, or face
book.

She said the book will include
more candid photos and pictures of
deans and dorm counselors.

‘‘Our book is an embarrassment’’
compared to other schools’ books,
many of which are like ‘‘mini-year-

She said some FOC members

A Washington and Lee theater major is
bringing 15th century Japan to W&L.

Senior Chris Smith’s one-act Kyogen
comedy, called ‘‘The Perfect Servants,’’ ex-
amines relationships between the nobility and
their servants.

The show opens in the Lenfest’s Johnson
Theater on December 6.

Kyogen, which means ‘‘a comic interlude,’’
is a type of Japanese dramatic performance,
which dates back to the 15th century, Smith
said. The one-act Kyogens were staged between
acts of a Noh drama, which is longer and more
complicated stylistically, he said.

Although the two dramas were traditionally
performed together, Smith said he is only
presenting the Kyogen.

*‘My view was to isolate the Kyogen from
that setting to heighten its appeal to the W&L
audience,’’ Smith said.

The play’s author, Donald Richie, is an
American authority on Japanese film who lived
in Japan for 45 years.

Smith said the play will mark his directing
debut, and according to Richie, the first perfor-
mance of the Kyogen in the United States.

Smith said Richie called the Lenfest per-
formance the ‘‘American premiere’’ of the
Kyogen.

Smith cast two males in female roles
because he said it would add authenticity to the
play. He added ‘‘It will add to the comic
element of the play and lead the audience to-
ward a different perspective, especially with the
suggested love scene.’’

W&L sophomore Jeff Mikita prepares for his upcoming role as a female maid.

Kyogen to debut at W&L

Smith said the Kyogen is especially
difficult for actors because very body movement
expresses an emotion in this acting style.

Sophomore Jeff Mikita, who plays a
female maid, agreed. He said he found it
difficult to imitate feminine vocal and body
movements.

‘*The most difficult aspect has been the
choreography and characterization,’’ Mikita said.

Senior Ben Worth said playing a woman
is challenging, but amusing. However, he said
he was most interested in introducing a new
theater expression to W&L.

In order to communicate these aspects of
the Kyogen technique and gestures in his show,
Smith said he asked senior Karen Halsell, who
has extensive dance experience, for assistance.

Halsell, who knew nothing about Japanese
choreography, said she picked up the style by
watching several hours of Noh and Kyogen
drama on video.

Halsell said it was difficult to make Mikita
and Worth appear feminine and complimented
the cast, who she said was ‘‘willing to experi-
ment.”’

‘*They all met with their tasks extremely
well,’’ Halsell, a biology major, said. ‘‘It was
such a wonderful experience to finally get out
of the science buildings and work in the
Lenfest.’’

All the cast members noted that Smith re-
acted well with them as a director, and ex-
pressed confidence in the results.

“It’s more of a relaxed atmosphere with a
student director,’’ junior David Phillips said. ‘‘It
allows for much freedom in communication.’’

‘*We’re more willing to voice our opinions
and experiment with Chris [Smith],’’ Mikita
said.

Thanksgiving

Students scatter for the holiday

 

By Joshua Manning
Staff Reporter

After ten weeks of school, most Wash-
ington and Lee undergraduates look forward
to the long-awaited start of Thanksgiving
vacation Friday.

Most of the W&L student body will be
scattered across the country during the
holiday.

While junior Keith Rinn, from New
York, joins his entire family in San Francis-
co to visit his brother in law school, senior
Pete Trammell questions the use of Thanks-
giving without a big football game.

Trammell will be in College Station,
Texas, Thanksgiving Day watching Texas
A&M play the University of Texas
in an annual intra-state rivalry.

Senior John Flippen will travel to
New York City with several friends
for the first part of vacation before
returning home to Florence, Ala. for
the holiday.

“They have tickets to see
Phantom of The Opera while
I’m at a job interview,’’
Flippen said. ‘‘One of the
guys has never been to New
York before, so I guess we’ll
do the touristy things.’’

Some students, like soph-
omore Mandy Keegan of
California, will be getting a
head start on winter.

=

“I’m going skiing in Deer Valley, Utah
for part of vacation,’’ Keegan said. ‘‘Then
I'll be writing a psychology paper.’’

But the vacation will not be a vacation
for members of the basketball team. With
the W&L Tip-Off tournament this weekend,

said. ‘‘There will be no formal supervision

reasons.”’

A food service official said Evans Din-
ing Hall will close Friday at noon. Students
remaining in Lexington will be responsible
for feeding themselves.

But, for some. students, the American
holiday of Thanksgiving doesn’t carry the
same meaning. Sophomore Miko Nyberg, of
Norway, and exchange student Masahiro
Yamashita, of Japan, will spend the time in
Georgetown, possibly traveling on to New
York. What will they be doing?

‘Dos Equis, Heineken and maybe a few
shots of tequila,’ said Nyberg. ‘‘It’s sort of
a Thanksgiving tradition where I’m from.’
How about some Coronas or Molsens, or
maybe a couple of Kamikaze shots.

Other international students will be

spending vacation very differently. Akino ©

Tsuchiya, of Japan, will be traveling to
South Carolina to spend the holiday with
friends. Junior Hui-Chu Mou and exchange
student Takato Yabusako will import friends

to Lexington from Boston and Ohio respec- °

tively.

Meanwhile at the W&L Law School, it -

will be business as usual until classes end
Nov. 26.

Reading days will continue until finals
begin on Dec. 5, most of the law students
will leave Lexington for a brief Thanksgiv-
ing, but a dedicated few will stick around to
study. <
“I’m in the minority,’ said Mike
Carlson, a third-year law student.
‘“‘But it doesn’t disturb me because
I'm expecting an invitation from

Dean Henneman for Thanks-
giving dinner.”’

Dinner invitation or not, vaca-
tion can’t arrive soon enough
for senior Susan Watkins.

‘I’m ready to be taken care
of again and not have to do my
laundry myself,’’ Watkins said.
Whether you're off to an island, going
home, maybe visiting a friends house, or
even staying right here in Lexington, don’t
forget to have a great vacation.

Also, remember even if it will be a
holiday filled with work for school, you
don’t have to get up for classes in the
morning.

Have a very happy Thanksgiving!

Students push politics

 

By Joyce Bautista
Staff Reporter

Every Sunday evening two sets of students square off
for a broadcasted battle of political ideologies called ‘‘The
Shooting Gallery.’’

The show, which started a month ago, is sponsored by
the Washington and Lee Foreign Affairs Club.

During the hour-long program, which begins at 8:30
p.m., the pairs debate several timely political issues.
Sophomores Matt Jackson and Ben Eggleston argue as
representatives of the Democratic Party. Their opponents,
first-year law students Tom Kleine and Chris Kowalczuk,
represent the views of the Republican party.

“It’s basically a debate format in which we discuss
national politics and some local issues,’’ said Jackson.

The four agree upon sparring topics about half-an hour
before each show.

On earlier shows the group has debated over Oliver
North’s new book Under Fire, civil rights, and the
politicians vying to become the U.S. Democratic
Presidential candidate.

““We've handled a good amount of sensitive topics,”’
Jackson said.

The participants say the aim of the show is to make

Imagine working 3-hours away from home four
days a week, and spending weekends writing a
doctoral thesis. For Jarvis Hall, newly appointed
assistant professor of politics, it’s all in a week’s
work.

After teaching classes in the Commerce School
from Monday to Thursday, Professor Hall hops in
his car and drives to Durham, NC to work on his
dissertation at Duke University.

Hall’s wife is an associate dean of [7
student counseling at the nearby
University of North Carolina at Cha-
pel Hill. The choice of Durham as a
home base actually serves to simplify
logisitical matters.

“‘The arrangement has generally
worked out quite nicely,’’ says Hall,
who lives in a university-owned fac-
ulty apartment when in Lexington.
‘*Although I haven’t had much of a

  

here,’’ he said. ‘‘It’s an excellent environment, par-
ticularly for a younger teacher, because the stu-
dents push you to be better prepared as a teacher.’’

Last year, Hall traveled to Duke to begin his
thesis, which is titled ‘‘The Relative Autonomy of
the State in Black Interest Articulation.’’ While he
spends most of his time there at the computer
terminal, he has had some exposure to Duke
academics.

‘I was a teaching assistant in a class of 200,”’
Hall said with a smile, noting the difference in
class sizes among schools.

listeners think about what’s going on in U.S. politics.

One listener, W&L freshmen Andy Wright, said he
thought the show was a good idea ‘‘but it seems the
debaters have little respect for each other. Things got way
out of hand.”’

According to Kleine, the group hopes more people
will get involved so the show can feature a rotation of
different debaters.

“A different person from the four is chosen each
week to act as the mediator and break to commercials,”’
he said.

Usually at the end of each show the group chooses,
what they call, the ‘‘Goat’’ and the ‘‘Hero”’ of the week.

“The ‘Goat’ of the Week is the person each of us
feel has been most offensive that week,’’ Kleine said.
“The ‘Hero’ of the Week is someone who has done
something remarkable recently.”’ Jackson said the
four have learned about themselves from the debates.

“We've learned that we're not as liberal or
conservative as we think,’’ Jackson said. ‘‘You find out
that you can’t label people strictly liberal or conser-
vative.”’

Jackson added that he, Kleine, Kowalczuk and
Eggleston welcome callers and input from the audience.

“If you don’t become politically enlightened at
college,’’ Jackson said, ‘‘where will you?’’

Before coming to W&L in the fall of 1989,
Hall taught at Saint Lawrence University in New
York. Although he enjoyed his stay there, Hall said
he has found W&L to be more challenging in-
tellectually.

‘‘The students are more capable and engaging

‘There is still much room for diversity, both
nationally, and here at W&L,’’ Hall asserts. ‘‘The
only way for you to strengthen your perspective is
to be more aware of the opposing perspective.”’

Hall said one of the advantages of teaching
here is that he is allowed to pursue his interests
inside and outside of the classroom while enjoy-
ing a good deal of support.

‘“‘All of the teachers here are committed to
teaching, but they actively engage in research as
well,’’ Hall notes. ‘‘There is a reasonable balance

So while Hall continues to do both, he looks to
the end of the year, when his thesis will be com-
pleted. Will he continue his commute?

‘*As of now I plan to stay here.’’ Hall said.

He said he made up his mind
when the Alpha Phi Alpha represen-
tative told him that ‘‘few, if any’
black students pledge other than
historically black fraternities on cam-
puses where students have a choice.

‘The school, gradually, has been
moving in the right direction... The
establishment of a black house would
be a step backward,’’ Perkins said.

John Harris, one of three seniors
who spoke in favor of Alpha Phi
Alpha, disagreed.

“Try to relate to what we’re
going through [as black students],”’
Harris, a former member of Chi Psi,
said. ‘‘I gave it [the fraternity sys-
tem] a shot for two years. It was not
what I want in fraternity.’

Senior Courtney Penn said Alpha
Phi Alpha can meet needs for black
students that the current fraternity
system does not.

‘Blacks do not party in the same
kind of way whites [do]’’ he said.
Alpha Phi Alpha would ‘‘upgrade the
social life for blacks.

Harris also echoed another point
Atkins made about integration at the
Nov. 12 IFC meeting.

and told, ‘integrate,’’’ he said. ‘‘Inte-
gration goes both ways.’’

Administrators seek student help
in teaching responsible drinking

 

ALCOHOL from page 1

bers and pledges, extreme drunkenness, and behavior
resulting from alcohol abuse.

Howison mentioned physical violence, sexual assault,
driving under the influence and arrest as behavior re-
sulting from alcohol abuse.

Drinking among underage students and alcohol abuse
among faculty will not be addressed.

Howison identified fraternities as being major abusers
of alcohol and called on fraternity presidents and Inter-
fraternity Council members to suggest ways to use alcohol
more responsibly.

“We are especially targeting fraternities and sororities
to take an active role in solving this problem,’’ Howison
said.

Associate Dean of Students and Counseling Psycholog-
ist Anne Schroer-Lamont said that she would like to see
students suggest a plan similar to the one currently in
place at Dartmouth University.

According to Schroer-Lamont, students at Dartmouth
are assigned as ‘‘party monitors’’ and make sure that
guests do not get overly intoxicated.

‘‘We need to train student leaders to follow models on

how to party and not have physical or mental damage,”’
Schroer-Lamont said.

Howison said that much of the violent behavior that
often accompanies excessive alcohol use could be elimi-
nated if fraternities and sororities were more willing to
discipline their members.

“If someone knew that he would have to face
disciplinary action from the fraternity as well as the
Student Conduct Committee, that might be a sufficient
deterrent to breaking the rules,’’ Howison said.

Associate Dean of Students Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’
Atkins called on fraternity chapters to take a broader look
at alcohol problems in their chapters and not just focus
on violence and vandalism.

Atkins also emphasized that fraternities have a respon-
sibility to enforce laws in the IFC constitution.

‘‘The University is not going to move in and enforce
these laws unless the fraternities simply refuse to do it
themselves,’’ Atkins said.

Schroer-Lamont said students who are interested in

proposing ideas to combat alcohol abuse should attend a

meeting of the Student Health Education Committee. It
meets Thursdays in the Arlington Women Center.

‘Students need to learn how to drink without passing
out. That’s not healthy,’’ Schroer-Lamont said.

The Ring-tum Phi, November 21, 1991

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

Over the past few years, the tradi-
tion has seemed to get away from the
Washington and Lee basketball pro-
gram. In 1991-92 head coach Verne
Canfield will try to put the tradition
back into W&L basketball.

‘‘We need to get back the neces-

sary pride and discipline that W&L
teams have had in the past,’’ said
Canfield, whose 429 career wins
place him among the all-time Di-
vision III leaders.
‘Ahead of him lies a formidable
task. Gone from last year’s 12-14
team are a group of seniors that
scored more points as a class than
any before it. Led by 1,000-point
scorers Chris Jacobs, Ed Hart and
Mike Holton, the senior class grad-
uated with 5,943 points.

Jacobs, Holton and Hart were all-
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
performers, and Jacobs was the
ODAC’s Player of the Year in 1989.
Craig Hatfield led the ODAC in
rebound in 1990. Pat Gallavan was
capable and did carry the team over
‘stretches with his three point shooting
yability. Jim Casey holds W&L’s
single-game record for three pointers
‘made with seven.

' While the task may not be easy,
‘Canfield is looking forward to mold-
‘ing a young team into one that will
exemplify what W&L basketball is all
about.

: ‘We've got a checklist of about
eight things that we want to do,”’
Canfield said. ‘‘All of them deal with
unselfish and hard, aggressive play.”’

' But more than just the statistics
‘ate gone. These players played the
majority of the minutes over the last
three seasons. That means the group
that will form this year’s nucleus will
be thrust into the limelight for the
first time.

‘When I say that we are young
and inexperienced, it’s not just a
cliche,’’ Canfield said. ‘‘Even our-
returning players haven’t had set
roles.”’

The leader will be captain Mark
Melton. The 6-foot-4 senior started
just four games last year, and will
have to adjust to a starting role. Last
year, he was Canfield’s ace in the
hole off the bench, playing as many
as four different positions.

‘*Mark is providing leadership we

haven’t had in a while,’’ said Can-
field. ‘‘He’s the type of player that
can sit on the bench and be a leader.
He’s a terrific team player.’

Senior Courtney Penn is the heir
apparent to Hatfield’s role of re-
bounder, defender and bruiser. At 6-
foot-4, Penn is a ferocious re-
bounder — he hauled in nine in just
19 minutes in last year’s 88-77 win
at Emory and Henry, and he just
might be the ODAC’s best defensive
forward.

‘*We won’t expect much from our
big men in terms of scoring,’’ said
Canfield. ‘‘We want our big men to
set screens, pass the ball back out to
our perimeter shooters, and rebound
and play post defense.’’

If this team has one strong area,
it should be the backcourt. The Gen-
erals return four guards, and Canfield
has found a couple of freshmen who
will blend into the rotation.

The point guard job belongs to
Bryan Brading. The 5-foot-8 junior
came on strong to close last season,
including back-to-back double figure
scoring games against Roanoke and
Eastern Mennonite.

‘‘He has developed in a short
period of time into one of the best
point guards we’ve ever had,’’ said
Canfield. ‘‘He will be called on to
set the table, and he can shoot the
three-pointer as well.”’

Along with Brading, sophomore
Paul Baker should see a lot of play-
ing time as the off-guard. Baker,
along with junior Bryan Watkins, was
a part-time starter at guard last year.

‘‘We've got some young guards
coming on,’’ said Canfield of the pre-
season workouts. ‘‘Baker is looking
good. We’ve got six people in the
backcourt, three at each position, who
could contribute this year.’’

The center position might be the
Generals’ biggest question mark. The
Generals return no one who has
played in the middle on the college
level. Sophomore Bryant Pless prac-
ticed at center last year, and he and
sophomore Robert Miggins will rotate
with two freshmen. Canfield says all
are unproven entities in the W&L
system.

‘There will be no stars in our
program,”’ said Canfield. ‘*Everyone
will have a set role, and it will be a
matter of meshing everyone’s roles
together. We’ve got eight or nine
players who will rotate. That has kept
everyone on their toes and ready to

Brading

play.’’

Canfield has been extremely
pleased with the way the team has
responded in the presesaon.

‘*This is my kind of team,’’ said
Canfield. ‘“‘They are very coachable,
and they are giving everything they
have on the court. I’m _ especially
pleased with our seniors. Mark and
Courtney have bent over backwards
to help the freshmen pick things up.’’

And the freshmen have picked
things up very well. After keeping six
freshmen on the roster, Canfield is
tossing around a Dean Smith-ian idea.

‘I’m thinking about playing five
freshman as a unit to go after it for
about a minute or two,’’ he said.
‘They definitely won’t embarrass
themselves out there.’’

Canfield has a young team, and
he knows that the team will make
mistakes. He can live with that.

‘‘We’ll make a ton of mistakes,”’
he said, ‘‘but they will be growth-
producing ones. I want to, see some
mistakes, because if we aren’t making
mistakes, that means we’re being too
cautious, and I want us to be aggres-
sive.”’

What he doesn’t know is how his
team will do in the won-loss depart-
ment, but Canfield won’t measure his
team’s success through just wins and
losses.

‘One thing is certain,’’ he said.
‘*We will go out and give it everyth-
ing we have each night, and after the
game we'll think about the next
game.”’

And it will be that effort that
eventually puts the tradition back in
W&L basketball.

‘*Sooner or later, the success will
develop,’’ Canfield said, ‘‘and people
will say W&L basketball is back.’’

Wrestlers look to veterans to

From W&L Sports Information

 

Washington and Lee started the
wrestling season two weekends ago at
the VMI Keydet Invitational and will
return to action December 6-7 at the
Lebanon Valley Invitational, an event
that annually brings the top Division
III teams in the East together.

Head coach Gary Franke has
some talented upperclassmen this
year, but will also have to rely on
the youth of his team as five of the
10 weight classes will probably be
manned by freshmen.

The top returnee is senior co-
captain Peer Soderberg. The 177-
pounder has racked up three straight
winning seasons, including a 14-10
mark last year with a team-high nine
pins. Soderberg was injured at the
end of last year, but should make a
run at the Eastern Championships this
year.

The other co-captain is 126-
pounder Rich Paini. The junior had
three pins last year after posting a
team-high five as a freshman. He will
be making a move up from the 118-

pound weight class this year.

Three other returnees with ex-
perience include 190-pounder John
Conkling, heavyweight Stewart Green
and 134-pounder Doug Lamb. Con-
kling, a junior, has shown big im-
provement each year and finished
fourth at the VMI Keydet Invitational
in the heavyweight class.

Green, a junior, also plays football
for the Generals but had to sit out
this season with an injury. That lack
of activity should make him hungry
to return to the mat.

Lamb, also a junior, will battle
with freshman Adam Williams at the
134-pound class. Lamb wrestled at
both 134 and 142 last year and will
probably see action at both classes
again this year.

Franke has several talented fresh-
men, but expects the biggest damage
to come from Williams and 158-
pounder Lea Abercrombie. Williams
was a two-time district champion
wrestling at Cave Spring High School
in Roanoke and Abercrombie com-
piled a 35-9 record at George Wash-
ington High School in Danville.

The Generals early season lineup

should be as follows: freshman ohn
Cochran at 118 pounds, Paini at 126
pounds, either Lamb or Williams at
134 pounds, freshman John Cherry at
142 pounds, freshman Josh Helton at
150 pounds, Abercrombie at 158
pounds, freshman Beau King at 167
pounds, Soderberg at 177 pounds,
Conkling at 190 pounds and Green at
heavyweight.

After wrestling just three dual
matches last year (1-2 with a win
over Georgia Tech), the Generals will
have six duals this year: Davidson,
Greensboro, Anderson, Johns Hop-
kins, Western Maryland and cross-
state rival Longwood. In addition
W&L will take place in five in-sea-
son tournaments, including the 15th
annual Washington and Lee Invita-
tional in late January.

Another highlight of the schedule
will be the Virginia State II-III
Championships at Norfolk State in
early February.

The Generals had no state cham-
pions last year, but Peer Soderberg
finished in second place and three
Generals finished in third place, in-
cluding Conkling at heavyweight.

New sath
same results

From W&L Sports Information

 

 

Washington and Lee’s women’s
swimming season gets underway with
the dual meet challenge this weekend
at the Twombly Pool. It will be a big
early season test for the Generals as
Allegheny, Centre and Ithaca will all
come to Lexington.

The swimming program at W&L
has undergone a facelift this year,
with Kiki Jacobs taking over as the
women’s head coach. But you can
expect some of the same results from
W&L as you've seen in the past.

Jacobs inherits a women’s team
that has won four straight Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference titles and
last year won its first Atlantic States
tile. Two key returnees from last
year’s championship team are senior
captain Jodi Herring and junior Claire
Dudley, a national qualifier last year.

Herring was W&L’s freestyle
specialist, notching W&L’s season-
best times in the 200, 500, 1000 and
1650 free. The three-time All-ODAC
performer won the 200, 500 and 1650
free titles at last year’s Atlantic
States Championships and she is a
member of every one of W&L’s
school record relay event teams.

Dudley qualified for the nationals
in the 200 breaststroke last year after
earning All-America honors as a
freshman. She holds six school re-
cords, including individual records in
the 100 breast, 200 breast, 200 in-
dividual medley and 400 IM.

Three other returning letterwinners
that will aid the Generals’ cause are
senior Louise Adamson, and soph-
omores Jeanette Burgess and Kari
May.

Remillard’s expectations
high for young swimmers

 

By Sean O’Rourke
Staff Reporter

 

As most students head home for
Thanksgiving, the last thing on their
minds is hitting the water to swim.

But for some students who choose
to stay in Lexington, swimming is the
only thing on their minds.

The Washington and Lee men’s
swimming team will open its 1991-
92 season by taking on Allegheny,
Centre and Ithaca this coming week-
end.

The three meets at Twombly Pool
will mark the thirteenth year of
men’s swimming under the leadership
of coach Page Remillard. After a
tough season last year, the veteran
coach is excited about this year.

“T have a lot of optimism about
this year,’’ he said. ‘‘I can just tell
things are going to go well. We've
been working hard and everyone’s
goals are the same. Now we just
have to implement those goals.’’

Remillard also feels that this
season will be much different from
last season.

‘Last year was a struggle for
us,’’ explained the coach. ‘‘This
year it’s going to be a struggle for
the other teams.”’

The other teams will be facing a
very young Generals team. W&L
will field a team with 10 freshmen,
four sophomores, three juniors and
one senior.

The talented crop of freshmen
bring new blood and enthusiasm to
the team, but they also carry a degree
of inexperience with them. Even so,

Remillard is still expecting a great
deal out of them.

“I’m expecting a lot from the
freshmen group,’’ Remillard said. ‘‘I
need Doug Brown [the only senior]
to lead them because he’s been
through it all. There’s a big dif-
ference between collegiate swimming
and high school swimming.

‘‘The freshmen will be the nu-
cleus of this team, but right now,
they need to gain experience,’’ he
said.

Brown won't be the only one
Remillard will rely on. Juniors Chris
Hagge, Marc Lotano and Andrew
Pearson will have to carry some of
the burden throughout the season.
The sophomores won't be ignored
either.

Even if Remillard seems unsure
about the team’s experience, he’s not
unsure about his team’s speed.

“I think our kids will be sur-
prised at how fast they’re swimm-
ing,’’ he said. ‘‘They’ve been work-
ing hard and their times are good. I
feel we’re real strong in the freestyie
events, but we’re still untested in the
stroke events [breaststroke, backstroke
and butterfly].”’

With such a young group, Remil-
lard says his expectations are reason-
able.

“T want to have a_ winning
season, and I want to get guys to the
nationals,’’ he said. ‘‘I think, looking
at the team, that we have a great
chance to accomplish both.”’

The Dec. 4 meet against VMI will
be the student body’s first chance to
look at the team while school is in
session.

Defense leads way to year’s only win

WIN from page 8

 

the first eight games of the season
before moving back to defense, where
he played for his first two and a half
years.

‘“‘The move wasn’t that tough for
me,”’ he said. ‘‘The players and the
coaches were patient in teaching me
the system. It wasn’t that big of a
change since I had played before. I
just needed a refresher course.’’

Kiehl said the win to end the

season was as rewarding a win as he
could ever get.

“It doesn’t get much better than
this,’ he said. ‘‘But it’s tough to
play that well and realize that you
don’t have any more games to play.”’

“It was the perfect way to end up
a season like we had,’’ said Fallon.
“The seniors feel good because they
won their last game, and the younger
players are excited about next year.’’

Fallon said that the team never
gave up during the season.

‘*We never slacked off,’’ he said.

“They believed in preparing and they
gave everything they had. The Guil-
ford game indicated that. We were
down 25-0 at the half and could have
packed it in. But we didn’t. We came
out and hit hard and shut them out.
The kids hung tough all year, and
they deserve credit for that.

“‘We knew the last game was
going to be tough. They were a good
team. It was a challenge,’’ Fallon
said. ‘‘I guess it was a storybook
finish to our season.”’

Freshman William Propst breaks a tackle on his way to a 61-yard
gain in W&L’s 27-12 win over Georgetown.

 

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

The Georgetown University foot-
ball team must be sick of seeing the
Washington and Lee Generals line up
across from them — especially when
the Generals have extra incentive to
win the game.

In 1975, the Generals went into
the last game of the year looking for
their first win, and got it against the
Hoyas 28-26.

In each of the past two seasons,
the Generals have needed to beat the
Hoyas to keep from having a losing
season. Each time they succeeded.

And this season, the Generals
needed to beat the Hoyas to eam
their first win of the season.

‘‘T guess we have their number,”’
said a jubilant Greg Kiehl as the
Generals left Kehoe Field Saturday
after a 27-12 win to salvage the
season with a 1-9 record.

The Generals scored 21 points in
the last four minutes of the first half
and intercepted the nation’s best
passing offense seven times to eam
the win.

“It’s been a tough fall,’’ said
senior comerback-turned-quarterback-
turned-cornerback-again Fred Ren-
neker. ‘‘No one ever wanted to give
up during the season, and it finally
was our tum to win.”’

The defense dominated all day
long for the Generals, mostly because
of a new package that defensive
coordinator Frank Méiriello installed
especially for Georgetown.

‘‘We went with a dime package,”’
he said. ‘‘We thought we could
match-up better with two extra defen-
sive backs for two reasons. One, it
gave us better coverage, and two, it
gave us better speed coming off the
corner on a blitz. It was pretty effec-
tive.’’

The Generals blitzed the Hoyas
relentlessly and successfully all after-
noon, much to the delight of a sur-
prisingly pro-W&L crowd.

“It was wierd that we had more

fans at the game than they did,’’ said
Kiehl. ‘‘But it was great to see
everyone cheering and singing ‘The
Swing’ when we scored.”’

Led by senior defensive end John
McCallum, the Generals sacked Geor-
getown quarterbacks eight times, and
when they didn’t sack them, they
intercepted them a_ school-record
seven times.

‘*Sometimes the best pass defense
is a good rush,’’ said head coach
Gary Fallon. ‘‘We put all kinds of
pressure on them and forced them to
throw when they didn’t want to.”’

All of the interceptions came off
of backup quarterback Bill Jenkinson,
who took when Aley Demarest left
the game with a separated shoulder
late in the second quarter after he
was hit by freshman defensive tackle
Jason Chartrand.

Neither was effective on the day.
Demarest completed just three of 10
passes before he left, and Jenkinson
seemed like W&L’s best weapon,
completing just 12 passes to his own
teammates.

‘Once we got the interceptions,”’
Fallon said, ‘‘we really got rolling.’’

W&L trailed 3-0 when Demarest
left the game. After Jenkinson
couldn’t move the Hoyas on his first
try, the Generals took over on their
own 28-yard line.

Operating out of the run and
shoot offense, on third down at the
W&L 35, freshman quarterback Geren
Steiner hit freshman wide receiver
William Propst for a 61-yard gain to
the Georgetown four-yard line.

Two plays later, junior fullback
Mark Goglia blasted into the end
zone to give the Generals their first
lead since the second week of the
season against Alabama-Birmingham,
7-3 with 4:26 left in the half.

The Hoyas intercepted Steiner on
the Generals’ next possession but
immediatley returned the favor, open-
ing the floodgates for the Generals.

On the next play from scrimmage,
sophomore cornerback Bill Harker
picked off Jenkinson’s pass and re-
turned it to the Georgetown 35.

Hannah, Edwards qualify for national meet

The Washington and Lee men’s
and women’s cross country teams
emerged from the Southeastern Re-
gional meet with honors for their
respective top runners.

Bo Hannah and Charles Edwards
earned berths at the National Cham-
pionship meet by finishing fourth and
seventh respectively in a field of
eighty-five competitors. Kim Herring
became the first W&L female all-
region runner. She earned the honor
with her 13th-place finish.

‘Bo and I were both very close
to making it to nationals last year,’’
said Edwards. ‘‘We really wanted it
this year and getting so close [last
year] gave us extra momentum.”’

Edwards’ time of 26:22 along
with Hannah's time of 25:51 were the
best times each had ever recorded.

Also running personal best races
were Keith Rinn, who landed a 16th-
place finish in a time of 27:10, and

Lee Parker whose 27:28 time placed
him 20th overall.

Matthew Brock rounded out the
solid team performance which gave
the Generals a fourth place overall
finish out of twelve teams represent-
ing the competitive region that ex-
tends west to the Mississippi River
and north to the Virginia border.

W&L finished with 92 points,
trailing only Mary Washington Col-
lege, Emory University, and the stel-
lar Lynchburg team that recorded a
score of 35.

Head coach John Tucker said,
‘‘Considering that 67 points won it
last year, Lynchburg just ran an in-
credible race.”’

The women also ran against stiff
competition, yet managed an eighth
place finish out of seventeen schools.
Once again Kim Herring paced the
team, finishing with a time of 19:49.
Herring, W&L’s best first-year runner
ever, already has seven of W&L’s
top times ever, and has run all but
one of her races under 22:00 this
year.

Nicole Casteel capped an excel-
lent season with her seventh consecu-
tive second place finish on the team
with a time of 20:53. Diedre Dene-
chaud showed that she is the most
improved runner on the team by
placing third. She was only placed on
the traveling squad at mid-season.

Sue Deutsch and Brandi Hender-
son rounded out the top five. Cap-
tain Jodi Herring ran a competitive
race to culminate a season-long battle
with her health, said coach Jim
Phemister.

Her hard work and determination
inspired and led the young team that
improved steadily throughout the
year, and with all of the top five
runners returning, the Generals plan
on returning to the thick of the hunt
for the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference championship.

As the women lay designs on next
year, Hannah and Edwards prepare
themselves for the biggest race of
their lives.

Edwards, a senior co-captain, was
quick to acknowledge the role Tucker

played in their success.

‘We both improved a great deal
this year, and that can be attributed
to Coach’s intensity,’’ he said.

Tucker worked the team harder
than previous seasons, and the rig-
orous training is paying dividends for
the duo.

“TI could not be prouder,’’ he
said. ‘‘They did everything I asked of
them and more. It is quite an ac-
complishment just to make it to na-
tionals.”’

They each know that it will be a
tough NCAA field, but they are ready
to meet the challenge.

‘‘T know what I have to do and
who I have to stay with,’’ said Han-
nah, who has led W&L in every race
this year. ‘‘It is just a matter of
doing it.’’

Edwards is preparing to make his
last race his best one.

‘*The field will be so much more
competitive, but I am just going to
go out as fast as I can and give it
everything I have,’’ he said.

Given a reprieve, Steiner found
senior Jeff Kreis for a 27-yard gain
to the eight-yard line to start the
drive, and then capped it with a five-
yard scoring pass to sophomore Wil-
son Moore.

W&L took a commanding lead on
Georgetown’s first play after the
kickoff. Renneker intercepted Jenkin-
son’s pass and returned it 25 yards
for a touchdown, giving the Generals
a 21-3 halftime lead.

“The receiver just ran a stop
route, and the ball was supposed to
be there when the receiver got
there,’’ Renneker said. ‘‘I just hap-
pened to be there, and the ball hit me
in the chest. I looked up and there
was nothing in front of me but green
turf.”’

Renneker’s score had the Generals
celebrating as they left the field for
halftime, and that concerned Fallon.

‘‘Fred’s was a big, big play,’’
said Fallon. ‘‘All of our success came
so quickly, but we still had a whole
half to play. We hadn’t won anything
at that point.”’

Both teams struggled offensively
to start the second half. Georgetown
managed a third quarter field goal to
cut into the Generals’ lead, and then
struck again with their defense early
in the fourth quarter.

Jim Bolger intercepted Steiner’s
first down pass and returned it 34
yards for Georgetown’s only touch-
down, cutting the lead to 21-12. The
Hoyas went for the two-point conver-
sion, but McCallum hit Jenkinson as
he tried to pass and broke up the
play.

The Generals’ defense then took
over. W&L intercepted Jenkinson the
last three times Georgetown had the
ball. Freshman Jon Wagner’s inter-
ception helped set up the Generals’
final touchdown.

After the Generals abandoned the
run and shoot to eat up more time,
junior Wade Robinett carried for nine
yards to the Georgetown 28, and
Kreis carried for 26 more on a re-
verse to the two-yard line. On the
next play, freshman fullback Matthew

Mogk powered in for the touchdown
that iced the game, 27-12.

‘It was a nice victory for our
kids,”’ said Fallon. ‘‘Especially for
the seniors I’m tickled to death.”’

On the day, the W&L offense
registered a season-high 305 yards.
The offensive line anchored by sen-
iors Steve Fugitte and Jim Henry
gave Steiner enough time to pass for
235 yards, 134 of which went to
Propst, and the defense held Geor-
getown's passing attack to just 105
yards. The Hoyas entered the game
averaging 307 yards passing per
game.

Renneker and Harker each had
two interceptions, and Wagner, senior
Scott Williamson and freshman Marc
Newman each had one.

McCallum made seven tackles,
had four sacks, registered three tack-
les-for-losses and forced a fumble to
lead the way.

‘We had a hey day rushing the
quarterback,’ said Kiehl, W&L’s
senior nose guard. ‘‘It must have
been scary for their quarterbacks to
go back and pass. McCallum was all
over the place, and the rest of us
weren’t far behind him.’’

Of the Generals’ sacks, junior Phil
Spears and senior Scott Williamson
each had two and Kiehl and junior
Lyle Smith each added one of their
own,

‘The pressure our line put on
was the key,’’ said Renneker. ‘‘When
you can pressure the quarterback and
make him worry, it makes a tremen-
dous difference in the game.”’

Fallon said that the had a good
idea of how to stop the Hoyas’ pass-
ing attack.

“‘Since we were running the run
and shoot, we did a lot of things that
they did,’’ he said. ‘‘We knew what
would give us trouble, and that gave
them trouble too. And the defensive
coaches came up with a great game
plan.”’

Renneker should know what pres-
sure can do to a quarterback. He

From W&L Sports Information

 

The women’s soccer season has
long since passed, but the honors
keep rolling in for Washington and
Lee's regular-season Old Dominion
Athletic Conference championship
team.

Senior defender Nancy Mit-
chell was named the ODAC Player

first time all-ODAC performer,
anchored the stingiest defense in
the conference. The Generals al-
lowed less than one goal per
game.

Mitchell headed a list of three
first team selections. Sophomore
goalie Kate Stimeling, who re-
corded a school record nine shut-
outs and posted a .904 save per-
centage, and sophomore forward
Corinda Hankins were also named
to the first team.

The all-conference and_all-

THE ALPHA PHI ALPHA VOTE

  

IFC votes to OK colonization
of proposed black fraternity

Alpha Phi Alpha, the historically black
fraternity, has IFC endorsement to colonize
at Washington and Lee after an IFC vote
of 11-4 in favor, IFC President Greg Hicks
said at the council meeting tonight.

The 11-4 vote represents 73 and one-
third percent of the voting council mem-
bers, slightly short of the constitutionally
mandated three-quarters approval.

But under Robert's Rules of Orders,
which govern the IFC under the council’s
constitution, that difference may be roun-
ded, depending on precedents set by the
voting body, according to Lewis LaRue,
alumni professor of law.

Hicks could not be reached for com-
‘ment after he left the University Center
tonight and before 9 p.m. press time.

Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Kappa Sigma,
Pi Kappa Alpha and Sigma Chi voted
against the new chapter. Sigma Alpha
Epsilon was absent.

According to IFC Treasurer Thomas
Snedeker, SAE President Gene Pride was
late to the meeting and said he would have
voted in favor of Alpha.

Phi Kapp President Marc Short said
one argument against Alpha was that it
might segregate the campus. He also said
that any house voting against Alpha would
have to commit to improving the social
lives of W&L’s black students, if Alpha
did not pass.

Sigma Nu President Heath Dixon voted
in favor of Alpha, though he said he hopes
historically single-race fraternities will
become obsolete as all fraternities become
racially integrated.

opportunity for black students on campus

Freshman William Propst breaks a tackle on his way to a 61-yard
gain in W&L’s 27-12 win over Georgetown.

 

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

The Georgetown University foot-
ball team must be sick of seeing the
Washington and Lee Generals line up
across from them — especially when
the Generals have extra incentive to
win the game.

In 1975, the Generals went into
the last game of the year looking for
their first win, and got it against the
Hoyas 28-26.

In each of the past two seasons,
the Generals have needed to beat the
Hoyas to keep from having a losing
season. Each time they succeeded.

And this season, the Generals
needed to beat the Hoyas to eam
their first win of the season.

“*T guess we have their number,”’
said a jubilant Greg Kiehl as the
Generals left Kehoe Field Saturday
after a 27-12 win to salvage the
season with a 1-9 record.

The Generals scored 21 points in
the last four minutes of the first half
and intercepted the nation’s best
passing offense seven times to earn
the win.

“It’s been a tough fall,’’ said
senior cornerback-turned-quarterback-
turned-cornerback-again Fred Ren-
neker. ‘‘No one ever wanted to give
up during the season, and it finally
was our turn to win.’’

The defense dominated all day
long for the Generals, mostly because
of a new package that defensive
coordinator Frank Miriello installed
especially for Georgetown.

‘‘We went with a dime package,”’
he said. ‘‘We thought we could
match-up better with two extra defen-
sive backs for two reasons. One, it
gave us better coverage, and two, it
gave us better speed coming off the
comer on a blitz. It was pretty effec-
tive.’’

The Generals blitzed the Hoyas
relentlessly and successfully all after-
noon, much to the delight of a sur-
prisingly pro-W&L crowd.

“It was wierd that we had more

fans at the game than they did,’’ said
Kiehl. ‘‘But it was great to see
everyone cheering and singing ‘The
Swing’ when we scored.”’

Led by senior defensive end John
McCallum, the Generals sacked Geor-
getown quarterbacks eight times, and
when they didn’t sack them, they
intercepted them a_ school-record
seven times,

‘*Sometimes the best pass defense
is a good mush,’’ said head coach
Gary Fallon. ‘‘We put all kinds of
pressure on them and forced them to
throw when they didn’t want to.”’

All of the interceptions came off
of backup quarterback Bill Jenkinson,
who took when Aley Demarest left
the game with a separated shoulder
late in the second quarter after he
was hit by freshman defensive tackle
Jason Chartrand.

Neither was effective on the day.
Demarest completed just three of 10
passes before he left, and Jenkinson
seemed like W&L’s best weapon,
completing just 12 passes to his own
teammates.

*‘Once we got the interceptions,”’
Fallon said, ‘‘we really got rolling.’’

W&L trailed 3-0 when Demarest
left the game. After Jenkinson
couldn’t move the Hoyas on his first
try, the Generals took over on their
own 28-yard line.

Operating out of the run and
shoot offense, on third down at the
W&L 35, freshman quarterback Geren
Steiner hit freshman wide receiver
William Propst for a 61-yard gain to
the Georgetown four-yard line.

Two plays later, junior fullback
Mark Goglia blasted into the end
zone to give the Generals their first
lead since the second week of the
season against Alabama-Birmingham,
7-3 with 4:26 left in the half.

The Hoyas intercepted Steiner on
the Generals’ next possession but
immediatley returned the favor, open-
ing the floodgates for the Generals.

On the next play from scrimmage,
sophomore cornerback Bill Harker

tumed it to the Georgetown 35,

The Washington and Lee men’s
and women’s cross country teams
emerged from the Southeastern Re-
gional meet with honors for their
respective top runners.

Bo Hannah and Charles Edwards
earned berths at the National Cham-
pionship meet by finishing fourth and
seventh respectively in a field of
eighty-five competitors. Kim Herring
became the first W&L female all-
region runner. She earned the honor
with her 13th-place finish.

‘Bo and I were both very close
to making it to nationals last year,”’
said Edwards. ‘‘We really wanted it
this year and getting so close [last
year] gave us extra momentum.”’

Edwards’ time of 26:22 along
with Hannah’s time of 25:51 were the
best times each had ever recorded.

Also running personal best races
were Keith Rinn, who landed a 16th-
place finish in a time of 27:10, and

Lee Parker whose 27:28 time placed
him 20th overall.

Matthew Brock rounded out the
solid team performance which gave
the Generals a fourth place overall
finish out of twelve teams represent-
ing the competitive region that ex-
tends west to the Mississippi River
and north to the Virginia border.

W&L finished with 92 points,
trailing only Mary Washington Col-
lege, Emory University, and the stel-
lar Lynchburg team that recorded a
score of 35.

Head coach John Tucker said,
‘‘Considering that 67 points won it
last year, Lynchburg just ran an in-
credible race.’’

The women also ran against stiff
competition, yet managed an eighth
place finish out of seventeen schools.
Once again Kim Herring paced the
team, finishing with a time of 19:49.
Herring, W&L’s best first-year runner
ever, already has seven of W&L’s
top times ever, and has run all but
one of her races under 22:00 this
year.

Nicole Casteel capped an excel-
lent season with her seventh consecu-
tive second place finish on the team
with a time of 20:53. Diedre Dene-
chaud showed that she is the most
improved runner on the team by
placing third. She was only placed on
the traveling squad at mid-season.

Sue Deutsch and Brandi Hender-
son rounded out the top five. Cap-
tain Jodi Herring ran a competitive
race to culminate a season-long battle
with her health, said coach Jim
Phemister.

Her hard work and determination
inspired and led the young team that
improved steadily throughout the
year, and with all of the top five
runners returning, the Generals plan
on returning to the thick of the hunt
for the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference championship.

As the women lay designs on next
year, Hannah and Edwards prepare
themselves for the biggest race of
their lives.

Edwards, a senior co-captain, was
quick to acknowledge the role Tucker

played in their success.

‘‘We both improved a great deal
this year, and that can be attributed
to Coach’s intensity,’’ he said.

Tucker worked the team harder
than previous seasons, and the rig-
orous training is paying dividends for
the duo.

‘I could not be prouder,’’ he
said. ‘‘They did everything I asked of
them and more. It is quite an ac-
complishment just to make it to na-
tionals.”’ ;

They each know that it will be a
tough NCAA field, but they are ready
to meet the challenge.

‘I know what I have to do and
who I have to stay with,’’ said Han-
nah, who has led W&L in every race
this year. ‘‘It is just a matter of
doing it.’’

Edwards is preparing to make his
last race his best one.

‘*The field will be so much more
competitive, but I am just going to
go out as fast as I can and give it
everything I have,’’ he said.

Given a reprieve, Steiner found
senior Jeff Kreis for a 27-yard gain
to the eight-yard line to start the
drive, and then capped it with a five-
yard scoring pass to sophomore Wil-
son Moore.

W&L took a commanding lead on
Georgetown’s first play after the
kickoff. Renneker intercepted Jenkin-
son’s pass and returned it 25 yards
for a touchdown, giving the Generals
a 21-3 halftime lead.

“The receiver just ran a stop
route, and the ball was supposed to
be there when the receiver got
there,’’ Renneker said. ‘‘I just hap-
pened to be there, and the ball hit me
in the chest. I looked up and there
was nothing in front of me but green
turf.’’

Renneker’s score had the Generals
celebrating as they left the field for
halftime, and that concerned Fallon.

‘‘Fred’s was a big, big play,’’
said Fallon. ‘‘All of our success came
so quickly, but we still had a whole
half to play. We hadn’t won anything
at that point.”’

Both teams struggled offensively
to start the second half. Georgetown
managed a third quarter field goal to
cut into the Generals’ lead, and then
struck again with their defense early
in the fourth quarter.

Jim Bolger intercepted Steiner's
first down pass and returned it 34
yards for Georgetown’s only touch-
down, cutting the lead to 21-12. The
Hoyas went for the two-point conver-
sion, but McCallum hit Jenkinson as
he tried to pass and broke up the
play.

The Generals’ defense then took
over. W&L intercepted Jenkinson the
last three times Georgetown had the
ball. Freshman Jon Wagner’s inter-
ception helped set up the Generals’
final touchdown.

After the Generals abandoned the
run and shoot to eat up more time,
junior Wade Robinett carried for nine
yards to the Georgetown 28, and
Kreis carried for, 26 more on a. re-
verse to the two-yard ‘line. On the
next play, freshman fullback Matthew

Mogk powered in for the touchdown
that iced the game, 27-12.

“‘It_ was a nice victory for our
kids,’’ said Fallon. ‘‘Especially for
the seniors I’m tickled to death.’’

On the day, the W&L offense
registered a season-high 305 yards.
The offensive line anchored by sen-
iors Steve Fugitte and Jim Henry
gave Steiner enough time to pass for
235 yards, 134 of which went to
Propst, and the defense held Geor-
getown’s passing attack to just 105
yards. The Hoyas entered the game
averaging 307 yards passing per
game.

Renneker and Harker each had
two interceptions, and Wagner, senior
Scott Williamson and freshman Marc
Newman each had one.

McCallum made seven tackles, ¢

had four sacks, registered three tack-
les-for-losses and forced a fumble to
lead the way.

From W&L Sports Information

 

The women’s soccer season has
long since passed, but the honors
keep rolling in for Washington and
Lee’s regular-season Old Dominion
Athletic Conference championship
team.

Senior defender Nancy Mit-
chell was named the ODAC Player
of the Year. Mitchell, a four-time
first time all-ODAC performer,
anchored the stingiest defense in
the conference. The Generals al-
lowed less than one goal per
game.

Mitchell headed a list of three
first team selections. Sophomore
goalie Kate Stimeling, who re-
corded a school record nine shut-
outs and posted a .904 save per-
centage, and sophomore forward
Corinda Hankins were also named
to the first team.

The all-conference and ll-
South region selections for the
other fall sports were also an-
nounced,

In cross country, Charles Ed-
wards, Bo Hannah, Nicole Casteel

and Kim Herring eamed all-
ODAC honors. Edwards, Hannah
and Herring were also all-region
performers. Jim Phemister was
named ODAC women’s Coach of
the Year.

In football, punter Bob Ehret
was named to the first team, and
offensive lineman Jim Henry and
defensive linemen John McCallum
and Phil Spears were named to the
second team.

THE ALPHA PHI ALPHA VOTE

  

IFC votes to OK colonization
of proposed black fraternity

Alpha Phi Alpha, the historically black
fraternity, has IFC endorsement to colonize
at Washington and Lee after an IFC vote
of 11-4 in favor, IFC President Greg Hicks
said at the council meeting tonight.

The 11-4 vote represents 73 and one-
third percent of the voting council mem-
bers, slightly short of the constitutionally
mandated three-quarters approval.

But under Robert's Rules of Orders,
which govern the IFC under the council's
constitution, that difference may be roun-
ded, depending on precedents set by the
voting body, according to Lewis LaRue,
alumni professor of law.

Hicks could not be reached for com-

¥Yment after he left the University Center
tonight and before 9 p.m. press time.

Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Kappa Sigma,
Pi Kappa Alpha and Sigma Chi voted
against the new chapter. Sigma Alpha
Epsilon was absent.

According to IFC Treasurer Thomas
Snedeker, SAE President Gene Pride was
late to the meeting and said he would have
voted in favor of Alpha.

Phi Kapp President Marc Short said
one argument against Alpha was that it
might segregate the campus. He also said
that any house voting against Alpha would
have to commit to improving the social
lives of W&L’s black students, if Alpha
did not pass.

Sigma Nu President Heath Dixon voted
in favor of Alpha, though he said he hopes
historically single-race fraternities will
become obsolete as all fraternities become
racially integrated.

[Now], in reality, there is not enough
opportunity for black students on campus

as far as the fraternity system,’’ Dixon
said,
Sophomore Maurice Cole said the IFC
vote will have a positive impact on W&L.
“It’s a positive statement being sent
out that the other houses and the school in
general will not neglect a group of students

who desire to participate in the fraternity

Senior Courtney Penn, one of the
students who petitioned for Alpha, refused
to comment on the vote.

‘Those articles [opinion columns] have
been sent to Alpha Phi Alpha, and believe
me, The Ring-tum Phi does not want to
fuck with Alpha Phi Alpha,’’ Penn said.

Staff Reporters Thomas Eisenhauer,
Joshua Manning and Greg Patterson con-
tributed to this story.

Staff members Jason Kelley, Rick Peliz,
Pamela Kelley and Cathy Lopiccolo pre-
pared this Special Report.

The Ring-tum Phi prints special reports
when particularly newsworthy events occur
and the Phi's regular publication schedule
does not allow coverage in a timely fashion.
