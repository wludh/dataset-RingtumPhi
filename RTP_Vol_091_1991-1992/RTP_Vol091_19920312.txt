MARCH 12, 1992

Hudnall cleared of rape and sodomy charges

 

By CATHY LOPICCOLO
Phi News Editor

Chad Edward Hudnall, a former Virginia
Military Institute cadet, was acquitted Wed-
nesday of raping and sodomizing a W&L
freshman in her dormitory room Oct. 13.

After the trial, one juror said the jury
didn’t have enough evidence to prove Hudnall
was guilty beyond reasonable doubt, as the
law requires.

‘*We had to go on the evidence,’’ the
juror said. ‘‘We could not just look at her [the
freshman] weeping and convict him.”’

On hearing the not-guilty verdict, Hud-
nall was visibly relieved, slumping over the
table where he sat with his lawyers. His
mother, seated behind him, burst into tears.

On the other side of the room, the
woman who charged Hudnall with sodomy
and rape began sobbing and ran from the
courtroom, with her mother and friends fol-
lowing to console her.

According to a Rockbridge Regional Jail
spokesman, Hudnall was released Wednesday
night on bond. One of Hudnall’s attorneys,
William Bobbitt Jr., of Waynesboro, said

 

Hudnall’s original $25,000 bond was reduced
after he was acquitted.

The 5-man, 7-woman jury deliberated
over two and a half hours before reaching the
not-guilty verdicts. After two hours, the jury
had reported it was unable to reach a unani-
mous verdict after three ballots. A juror said
after the trial that 10 jurors favored acquittal
while two favored conviction.

Rockbridge County Circuit Court Judge
George E. Honts III ordered the jury to con-
tinue deliberations and take another vote. The
verdict came 30 minutes later.

Commonwealth’s Attorney Eric Sisler
presented almost three hours of testimony,
but no physical evidence or medical reports.
He would not comment after the trial on why
no medical reports were entered as evidence.

The 19-year-old complainant testified
first, repeating her claim that Hudnall un-
dressed her while she slept in her Gilliam
Dormitory room, and that he put his penis
into her mouth. She said Hudnall then with-
drew and proceeded to rape her vaginally.

‘‘There was a man at the end of my bed
with no clothes on, lifting my body [to take
off my underwear],’’ the woman said. ‘‘He

climbed on top of me and started kissing my
breasts.”’

The woman, who cried during much of
her testimony, said Hudnall jumped off her
bed when she told him to stop and asked his
name. She testified that she put on a shirt and
ran to a friend’s room.

Several of the woman’s hallmates and
friends testified that she was crying and
shaking when she came out of her room.

‘She jumped on my bed, shaking and
sobbing like crazy, mumbling, but not making
sense,’’ one hallmate testified.

Students on the hall that night said that
Hudnall at first refused to give his name, and
that he said he was looking for junior dorm
counselor Christin Harvey.

‘“‘He told me he had come on the hail
because he knew Christin Harvey and had sex
with her twice before,’’ sophomore Kenney
Bullock said.

However, Harvey testified that she had
only talked with Hudnall. ‘‘My relationship
with him was very superficial,’’ she said.

Students detained Hudnall in the dorm
until W&L security and Lexington police
officers arrived.

 

Hudnall said
he had been look-
ing for Harvey

because he needed
a place to sleep
during his weekend
pass from VMI. He
said he had had sex
with Harvey once,
the night they met.

Hudnall and
the woman testified

 

 

 

 

they did not know
each other before
Oct. 13,

Hudnall said he saw the complainant
about 2 a.m., when her friends were taking
care of her while she was drunk.

Hudnall, who was also upset during his
testimony, testified that he entered the wo-
man’s room later, at 4 a.m., by mistake and
thought at first she might be Harvey.

Hudnall said that when he went to the
side of the bed, the woman took his hand. He
testified that they then started ‘‘kissing and
touching each other’’ and that she helped him
unbuckle his pants.

ANALYSIS

 

‘The Principle’

The revised CRC, according to
the proposal, would have jurisdiction
over all breaches of ‘‘The Principle of
Civility and Decency.”’ According to
the commentary section of the report,
the Principle is in the W&L tradition
of ‘‘measuring actions against [a]
general standard, not a code of specif-
ic rules,”’

The report says that the EC and
the Student Conduct Committee are
within this tradition. However, the
CRC’s present harassment policy has
come under attack because it is out-

Aggarwal considers open SCC trials

 

By JOYCE BAUTISTA
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Newly-elected Student Conduct Com-
mittee Chairman Reggie Aggarwal is consid-
ering opening the doors on SCC trials.

Aggarwal said he hopes to educate
students about the SCC’s function.

‘*T don’t want the students to view the
committee as some surreptitious, elite
group,’’ Aggarwal said. ‘‘I want to get stu-
dents familiar with the process while guard-
ing confidentiality.’’

An SCC trial would be opened only
upon the request of the defendant, he said.

His proposal comes in the first year the
SCC has conducted business under its new
constitution. The Student Affairs Committee
revised the SCC constitution last year, in-
creasing SCC autonomy and allowing it to
release the results of — but not the names of
those involved in — the cases it hears.

‘“‘The newly autonomous SCC reflects

the trend of student government,’’ he said.
‘*It shows that the university has faith in its
students.”’

If the SCC decides to recommend to
the Students Affairs Committee that defen-
dants be given the option of an open trial,
the recommendation would then have to get
faculty approval.

Dean of Students David Howison,
chairman of SAC, said, ‘‘At this point we
[SAC] have to wait for what the SCC has to
say.”’

Howison said he likes the idea of
educating students about the committee, but
refused to comment on the possibility of
open trials before receiving an SCC recom-
mendation.

Aggarwal said there are ramifications to
having open SCC trials.

‘*Many defendants who choose to have
open trials may play the public,” he said.

Current SCC Chairman Chris Haley
agreed.

policy within the tradition of the Hon-
or System as a general standard.

Ides, however, calls the Princi-
ple ‘‘a cloak designed to cover the
proposal with an appearance of tradi-
tion and legitimacy.’’ He points to the
procedural section of the proposal
which states that violations ‘‘relating
to sexual misconduct, or harassment
or discrimination based on the basis
of race, ethnicity religion, or sex’’ are
to be reported to the CRC. Ides cites
this statement as proof that the CRC
will not operate in a context beyond
these violations.

‘*This strikes me as a peculiarly
circumlocutious manner to get at the
problem,” he says.*‘if the ERC is
going to police sexual assault and
specified categories of harassment,
let’s just say so,”’

Constitutional questions

The Principle states that since
WA&L is a private school, ‘‘while our
discussion is appropriately informed
by the constitutional and legal requir-
ements placed on government regula-
tion of speech,
we are not
bound by such
j constraints.’’

The proposal’s
commentary
elaborates on
this point,
stating that
many facets of
W&L might be
considered
unconstitution-
al.

“‘Cardinal elements of this insti-
tution, such as the honor code, the
fraternity system and the workings of
the Student Conduct Committee, have
historically operated in ways which
might be subject to challenge on free

“I’m against it for a number of rea-
sons,”’ Haley said. He cited the possibility of
trials becoming a media circus and of stu-
dents becoming afraid to bring up cases.

“The cases we hear are sometimes
sensitive,”’ he said. ‘“There is no reason to
bring up people’s mistakes into the spotlight.

“{ don’t think any of this in the near
future will be brought up... [to] SAC,’’ Haley
said. “I’ve talked to a few people on the
committee, and they’re not in favor of it.’’

After Tuesday’s SCC meeting, Haley
said he concluded that the members of SCC
are against open trials.

“Everyone was pretty adamant about
keeping them [the trials] closed,’’ he said.

However, the idea of a mock trial was
brought up at the meeting as another possible
tool to educate the student body about the
SCC, Haley said.

“The only reason Reggie [Aggarwal]
wanted to look into the possibility of open

 

SCC trials was to educate,”’ he said.

Founded September 18, 1897

Clinton in ’92?

So, we had a first ballot surprise. Only two other times
since 1908 has Mock Convention nominated a presidential
candidate on the first ballot: William Jennings Bryan in
1908 and Ronald Reagan in 1980, one known as ‘‘The
Great Orator’’ and the other ‘‘The Great Communicator.”
Both faced very little opposition as the convention met.
Does Bill Clinton deserve such undisputed recognition?

Questions of military service, questions of sexual
impropriety, questions of financial mismanagement. Any one
of these have been known to kill political careers. Clinton
is plagued by all three. Many say Clinton is a damaged
candidate who will be slowly crucified during the general
election this fall. If this is true, the Democrats cannot afford
to nominate a candidate with such an uncertain background.

If a more pressing issue had not come up last week, we
would have run an editorial last week endorsing Paul
Tsongas for Mock Convention’s nomination. Pro-business,
with a clear, long-range economic plan, Tsongas does not
follow ideological lines. This could make him popular
among moderate, dissatisfied Republicans in November.
Tsongas, quickly developing a charisma of his own, also has
his impeccable reputation going for him. As Tip O’Neill
said this weekend, ‘‘Paul ... portrays decency and honesty to
the American people.”’

Yet Tsongas is another Greek Democrat from Massachu-
setts. His campaign is very unorganized (as his campaign
chairman explains, they never really expected to get this
far) and terribly underfinanced. Clinton has a strong political
machine, well-financed and boosted by the schedule of the
primaries. Despite his background, Clinton is clearly the
frontrunner, especially after the Super Tuesday returns. He
might very well take the nomination on momentum alone.
In this way, Clinton was an understandable choice for MC.

But don’t give him the nomination yet. Clinton controls
only about 780 pledged delegates of the 2,145 needed to
win. Tsongas, while holding only about 400 pledged
delegates, can easily catch up with strong showings in the
upcoming contests in Illinois, Michigan and Connecticut. The
contest is far from over. Super Tuesday did exactly what it
was supposed to: it gave a giant boost to a native son.
Clinton has yet to win a primary not in the South. He may
prove to be just as regional as Tsongas. Despite pleas from
Mario Cuomo for an early decision, followed by a
concentrated attack on the president, this race is likely to
remain in question until the real convention this summer.

snorkel, Homer

In the spirit of Mock Democratic Convention, the
university is taking a new approach to solving the car tax
problem. They’re throwing money at it.

In a memo recently circulated among Lexington City
Council members, City Manager T. Jon Ellestad thoughtfully
thanked university Treasurer Larry Broomall for W&L’s
allotment of $50,000 to the city for, what else? A snorkel
fire truck, of course.

We don’t know exactly what sets a snorkel fire truck
apart from other kinds of fire trucks, but we can already
imagine its sleek, red beauty gliding gracefully down the
streets of Lexington, which are themselves freshly paved,
thanks to car tax revenue. That’s student dollars at work.

Meanwhile Broomall maintains that the university
supports the students’ fight against the car tax. This latest
allotment, which adds to the $40,000 Broomall says has
been donated to the city so far this academic year, only
strengthens our case, he says. One of the best arguments
against the car tax is that we already give money to the city
via university gifts. Well, Broomall reasons, now we can
make that argument even more forcefully.

‘*Mayor Derrick, if you don’t do something about this car
tax, no more snorkel fire trucks for you!’ ‘

It’s time for the university to take a stand on the car tax
issue and opénly back student concerns. Not handing over
the student car list because of the Buckley Amendment was
a weak endorsement of the student position, but turning
around and handing more money over to the city is just a
stab in the student-body back.

your parents that tax bills may be coming, whether or not
you own a car.

This case raises some important questions about the «
city’s tax policy and the methods it is using to carry it out.

‘

Student chides President Wilson, administration on gallery placement and Delt decision’

 

My VIEW

By Colin J. Wynne, ’94

I have been at Washington and Lee for fifty
weeks, and there have been times at which I felt a
certain indefinable dissatisfaction with, for want of
a better term, ‘‘the way things are done.”’ I have
finally pinpointed the source of this angst, thanks
to a comment made by Prof. Wayne Dymacek.
Recently, in a conversation, he said the following:

 

“Before it makes a decision, the administration

1

should ask itself ‘How will this improve the ‘inter-
action between the ‘faculty and students?’ If their
answer is ‘It will not,’ then the action in question
should not be taken.”’

I came to W&L, as I believe most students
do, because of the particular atmosphere of aca-
demic camaraderie between a student and his
professor that encourages the passing on of knowl-
edge, which is the true strongpoint of the universi-
ty; and the aforementioned interaction is paramount
toward maintaining such a state.

And I feel the administration has done several
things to damage that interaction. Certainly, the
controversy over the Watson Gallery deserves
mention as such. Despite hundreds of signatures

Student strikes
back at critic

To the Editor:

“‘How we infuriate people when we speak
of the things which belong to their peace!’’ The
long-of-memory out there will recall all the
flattering attention I’ve been receiving on these
pages of late. Oddly enough, there have been
sounded amid the babble of imbecilic voices a
few notes worth commenting upon; when the
number of better things I have to do declines, I
may address them. For the moment, though, I
shall take up only one point, raised in the Feb. 27
letter from ‘‘Martha Miller, Law Wife.’’ Since
Martha held us all rapt with her rivetting life
story, I feel justified in answering her on whether
I have ‘‘ever had the opportunity to broaden [my]
visions outside the continental United States.’’

As a matter of fact, Law Wife, I spent the
first 19 years of my life (I am happy to say)
“‘outside the continental United States.’’ I have
drifted through Scotland, England, France, Spain,
Germany, the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia,
Greece and spent an entire summer working in
Italy. And in all my travels, I have joined the
intelligent and informed people I have met in
howling with laughter at modern American
“‘democracy.”’

Contrary to my experience of the wide
world, Martha’s convinced of ‘‘just how powerful
the American voting right is...”’ Oh, Martha. Poor
Martha. Don’t you get it? It costs $30 million
even to be considered presidential in contempo-
rary America. No human being who can raise that
kind of money is going to represent the people at
large. He or she (let’s be realistic and say ‘‘he’’)
will represent oil, or aerospace, or banking, or
this-time-I-won’t-take-no-for-an-answer-cut-the-
capital-gains, Above all, he will work for some
sector or sectors of the corporate wealth of the
country, which all reap immense profit — directly
or indirectly — from obscenely inflated ‘‘de-
fense’’ spending. He will be of very little use to
the people who are suffering from the deteriora-
tion of American society. And the people, in
larger and larger numbers, are coming to realize
this.

But all this truth threatens to mar the
sweetly naive afterglow of MC, so I leave off by
noting one final irony. When the proud Law

 

    

protesting the addition of a building to the Colon-
nade, even by several East Asian Studies majors
who feel a strong need for the purpose of the
gallery, the construction goes on as intended by
President Wilson. The faculty, to the best of my
knowledge, had no say in the matter because it was
“not an academic decision,’’ yet the offensive
location was chosen because of the academic
impact it would have on the East Asian Studies
Department. How can a decision which is opposed
by both the faculty and the students be for the

‘benefit of either?
“Also, I was disappointed with the finagling

that occurred after the Student Affairs Committee’s
initial decision concerning Delta Tau Delta fraterni-
ty. I do not have enough knowledge of the situation
personally to claim whether the original decision
was justified or not, nor would I wish to do so.
However, I do understand that, after reviewing the
information of the case, SAC decided on a five-
year suspension of the fraternity in question. Then,
after President Wilson ‘‘interceded,’’ according to
Delt House Corporation President Taylor Cole (in
a quote on the front page of the Feb. 27 issue of
the Phi), the sentence was reduced. The last I
checked, the ‘‘S’’ in SAC stood for ‘‘Student.’’

Delts thank W&L
for support

To the Editor:

The Brothers of Phi chapter of Delta Tau
Delta would like to extend our sincere thanks to
the many individuals involved in the recent
mitigation of our suspension. Without their
efforts, the 100-year history of Delta Tau Delta at
Washington and Lee would surely be drawing to
a close.

We owe our greatest debt to President
Wilson. Were it not for his time, consideration
and insight, our appeal would not have traveled
beyond his desk. His recommendation, in light of
a difficult situation, is greatly appreciated. Fur-
ther, we wish to acknowledge the careful work of
the Student Affairs Committee. SAC’s choice to
reconsider the case and act on President Wilson’s
recommendation was quite honorable. At no time
did the Delt brotherhood feel it would be appro-
priate for SAC to permit the chapter to go with-
Out penalty. We are pleased with the current
decision — both for its fairness and the message
it carries.

Without the support of the IFC, we would
never have chosen to appeal the original SAC
decision. The support of our fellow Greeks was
very important to us and those deciding our
future. We were flattered to receive it.

Enough cannot be said about the selfless
dedication of Phi chapter House Corporation
President Taylor M. Cole, '75. Taylor’s under-
standing, perseverance and diligence have not
gone unnoticed by the chapter. He is deserving of
special pride in the fact that the continued pres-
ence of Delt at Washington and Lee is a direct
result of his hard work. The letters and telephone
calls of our other alumni must also be recognized.
It appears that President Wilson considered the
concern of these men to be a positive force in
shaping the future of Delt. For this concern, we

whose scope are limited thereto should be handled
as such: by students. If Delt had evidence or
circumstances that would have warranted a lesser’
sentence, they should have presented them to SAC,
not President Wilson. Wilson himself adds to the
muddle by claiming ‘‘... the penalty... should’
punish the current chapter without jeopardizing... ,
the fraternity.”” That being the case, he ought to
have kept in mind that the five-year sentence exists’
because that is the length of time in which it can.
reasonably be expected that all current chapter
members will have graduated or otherwise departed ’
from W&L. By his own reasoning, the initial ,
decision should have stood. (Then, with the renova-
tion of the Delt house postponed for some five '
years, the half million or so dollars could be used
to reduce the planned tuition increase...)

All in all, I would hope for President Wilson,

or some of the trustees, to read this and take note.

of one thing: Washington and Lee is an educational
community, a place for professors to teach and
students to learn. Inasmuch as the administration ,
allows that to happen more smoothly, they are
necessary and welcome. But in the end, Washing- '
ton and Lee is for us, the studentc, and not a,

  

pedestal on which to display and record monuments

to an administration.

are deeply indebted.

We are quite thankful that at no time
during the past two months were we ever placed
in doubt as to whether we would have the back-
ing of Delta Tau Delta International. They quick-
ly rallied behind us and showed the chapter what
true brotherhood is. We thank them for opening
our eyes.

Lastly, we wish to thank the University
community as a whole. Without the casual posi-
tive comments from our professors, administrators
and fellow students, our morale would have been
instantly defeated. These people showed us that
Delta Tau Delta does occupy a special place at
Washington and Lee.

We appreciate the support and trust that it
will greet the return of Delta Tau Delta in 1993.

Sincerely,

Civility principle
shows CRC’s flaw

To the Editor:

Any member of the W&L community so
naive as to still believe that an administration-
appointed committee can effectively represent his
interests should take a discerning look at the
embarrassingly nonsensical ‘‘Principle of Civility
and Decency’’ recently proposed by the berserk
authoritarian kooks that rule the CRC. Flying in
the face of student opinion and the wishes of the
Board of Trustees, not to mention common sense,
the proposal openly embraces the concept of
political correctness in its lewd and vulgar entire-
ty while offering nothing more than an awkward
machinery for legislating as to the proper expres-
sions of interpersonal respect, something best left
to Emily Post's Book of Etiquette. If Washington
and Lee plans to continue luring prospective
students with grandiose tales of student self-
government, then the principle of honesty dictates
that it should immediately disband the obviously
unrepresentative CRC and return matters of
student discipline to the appropriately-elected
bodies.

Students challenge tuition increase

With the 6.5 percent tuition increase for the
1992-93 school year, many students have begun to

feel that what goes up must ... go up.

‘The tuition has gone up considerably over the
past five years,’’ said first-year law student and

WA&L alumnus James Rambeau, ’91.

The Board of Trustees decided at its Feb. 15
meeting to raise the undergraduate tuition from
$11,575 to $12,330 and law tuition from $12,830

to $12,050 next year.

Many students seemed wary of how the univer-

sity will spend the money it receives.

‘‘What new buildings are we financing, what
frat houses are we going to renovate, or are we
buying chairs for the Lenfest Center?’’ junior Erika

Lee asked.

‘‘Here we spend $80,000 on crepe paper and
cups for Fancy Dress, a college prom, while I’m
busy buying $35 worth of xerox copies in the
Religion Department because it can’t afford pa-

keep the tuition low,’’ Rambeau said.

address the convention because he
was giving a television interview.

Coming in third at MC with 120
MC delegates was Iowa Sen. Tom
Harkin, who Monday announced he
was dropping out of the race. Former
California Gov. Jerry Brown received
107 delegates, and even though he
ended his campaign the day before
MC voted, Kerrey received 12 dele-
gates.

MC gave the vice-presidential bid
to New York Gov. Mario Cuomo on
the second ballot. Cuomo had spoken
to the convention just before the
balloting began.

In a press conference after his
speech, Cuomo told reporters he
would ‘‘absolutely not’’ accept a vice
presidential nomination, but New

Mario Cuomo, New York
Gov. — ‘‘Abraham Lincoln.”’

 

York Chairman Jason Robinson said
he nominated Cuomo ‘‘as a gesture of
respect and appreciation.’’

After the balloting for both nomi-
nations was finished, MC Speakers
Chairman Ted Elliott asked journalist
Roger Mudd, a 1950 W&L graduate
who was covering the convention for
PBS, what he had thought of the
proceedings.

‘‘This was a joke,’’ Mudd said.
“‘The national media is calling this a
disgrace. The whole thing was run
rather sloppily, and it’s a big embar-
rassment for W&L.”’

As Mudd spoke, Elliott’s face
turned red and his lips began to quiv-
er. Mudd smiled.

‘‘Just kidding,’’ Mudd and the
other reporters at the press table
laughed. ‘‘This was a fine convention
and a great day.”’

Elliott looked relieved.

‘The only thing I
would say is that they
are increasing tuition
and also putting up
huge galleries,’’ Carr
said. ‘‘They should
look at fixing up the

Rambeau said he

mall, the hike in tuition expenses pay for faculty
and staff increased salaries and fringe benefits.

Broomall said the increase will also go to
departmental operating budgets which cover materi-
als needed for classes, utilities, telephone service
and travel to conferences.

‘Broomall said that on occasion the tuition
subsidizes other projected expenditures, such as the
Jesse Jackson lecture in 1989. But tuition does not
build galleries or fraternity houses, he said.

In spite of some students’ disapproval of the
tuition increase, some say the hike is necessary.

“The tuition increase is something inevitable in
order for the university to keep up with inflation,”’
sophomore Laina Ewan said.

Sara Deutsch seemed pleased with

W&L’s low tuition.

‘Compared to a lot of schools the tuition here
is a lot less,” Deutsch said, noting that a friend of
hers at Columbia pays over $20,000. ‘‘I think it’s

Gallery approval sparks
student jeers and cheers

Phi Staff Reporter

 

Many Washington and Lee stu-
dents say they wish the Board of
Trustees had decided to move the
Watson Gallery from its proposed
position on the Colonnade, which the
board approved last month.

Petitions from Sigma Nu, Pi
Kappa Alpha and other student orga-
nizations were signed in protest of the
placement of the building, which
would house an Oriental art collec-
tion.

‘The gallery would be a fine
thing to have if it were somewhere in
the back [of the campus],’’ said Sig-
ma Nu member Tim Wolff, who
signed the petition.

‘I’m not real fond of it,’’ junior
Elizabeth Miller said. ‘‘It would ruin
the look of the Hill.’’

Other students say they like the

idea of an Oriental art gallery, but
agree that the Colonnade would be
too crowded with another addition.
After seeing the building’s architec-
tural design, one student dubbed it
‘*Gaines on the Colonnade.”’

‘*T think it’s a shame to have it
crammed in when there are enough
buildings on the Colonnade already,”’
freshman Chris Albert said. ‘‘While it
might get more use on the Hill, the
collection should be put in or by the
Lenfest Center.’’

Other students, _ particularly
those involved in work-study at the
Reeves Center, approved of the new
addition to the Colonnade.

Landscaping, a sculpture garden
and the art itself ‘‘will enhance the
campus,”’’ freshman Jon Van Dyke
said. ‘‘It should be a good center of
attention around the admissions, sci-
ence, and art buildings; when it’s
built, people will appreciate it more.”’

Ides, CRC clash over report

speech, equal protection or due pro-
cess grounds,’’ the report says.

-» ew 'This does not mean that these,
features of this institution are inappro-

priate,’ the report says. ‘‘Exactly the
opposite, it means that we are free as
a private university to act to meet our
educational mission in ways which
are not open to state schools....”’

Ides says a university should
protect free speech.

‘‘We are educating young peo-
ple who will live both private and
public lives in a democratic society, a
central tenet of which is freedom of
speech,’’ Ides says. ‘‘If speech can be
curbed on campus, why not in more
general contexts?’’

Discriminatory or not?

The report’s commentary refers
to the Principle as ‘‘equally applica-
ble to all students.’’ The report goes
on to explain that if both parties
agree, any case may be tried by the
SCC. But if either the accuser or the
accused wants to keep the matter

private, the CRC must hear the case.

The latter provision is neces-
sary, the report says, because minori-
ties and women have recently become

Mainstream. members at W&L...

“Until we have made substan-

tially more progress on truly integrat- ©

ing all of our students into all facets
of the life of this University, we
ought not dismantle the single Uni-
versity enforcement mechanism that
was identifiably established for the
benefit of women and minority stu-
dents,”’ the report says.

Kelsey, in his dissent, calls this
statement proof that ‘‘a major moti-
vating force behind the policy is the
perception that white, southern males
cannot act responsibly toward any
minority group on this campus.”’

He says of such a targeted poli-
cy, “‘To say that one person’s pain is
any less real because he lacks a histo-
ry of oppression is to ignore the reali-
ties of life.’’

Ides concludes, ‘‘The Principle
is not meant as an invitation to im-
prove oneself, but as a threat to be
enforced through a specified and
organized adversarial process.”’

Frenzied fun.

Washington and Leé’s 20th Mock
Convention was just that, and much more.

The convention kicked off with a bit
of luck on it’s shoulder. The Friday-morning
skies looked like they literally wanted to rain
on the parade.

“Its like
someone was looking
down on us,” said
Dean of Students
David Howison.

Sophomore
Nathan Dunn, a del-
egate from Alabama,
said the parade was a
huge success.

“Everyone’s
having so much fun,”
Dunn said, “that’s
what it’s all about.”

For most
students this was the
first and last MC they
will experience. Many
said they believed that
this contributed to the
anticipation and ex-
citement of the event.

“The excit-
ing thing is that it’s
new toeveryone,” said
Roger Sullivan, a Vir-
ginia delegate.

Another
Virginia delegate,
Caroline Tsuji, said
she thought a good aspect of the convention
was that it was one of the few Washington and
Lee events that did not revolve around the
fraternity system.

“T like it because there are no barri-
ers,” Tsuji said. “It’s been a positive atmo-
sphere everywhere I’ve been.”

The prevalent opinion of students
and faculty was that the convention surpassed

any of their expectations.

“T was really surprised everything
went off,” said Illinois delegate Muriel Neel.
“It’s one of the best times I’ve ever had at
W&L.”

Robert Wilson, a delegate from
Texas, said that the massive event was well-
executed and that he was astonished at the
media coverage.

“It’s more far-reaching than I ever
thought,” he said.

tric. However, some delegates had hangovers

playing the proper convention enthusiasm.

“It’s like Fancy Dress only political,”
Michigan delegate Krista Taurins said.

Others said MC was more of aconve-
nient precursor to FD,

“Mock Convention makes scamming

student.

Another student, however, said he
hopes delegates at real conventions are more
sober than W&L students were.

“Tf this is the
way the real con-
vention runs, we're

Ohio delegate
Andy Barrick said.

Morrison (right) and his sparring partner during a workout at VMI.

Boxer trains at VMI

 

By JAMESON LEONARDI
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Heavyweight boxer and actor Tommy
“The Duke” Morrison is currently training at
Virginia Military Institute for a March 20 fight
against Wimpy Halstead on ESPN.

The 23-year-old fighter has amassed
a 29-1 record and is a contender for a champi-
onship fight as early as 1993. Morrison had
been ranked as high as eighth by the World
Boxing Council, but after his loss to Ray
Mercer, his WBC ranking dropped to 18th.

Ring Magazine editor Steve Farhood
said he believes that Morrison is a good fighter
with a lot of talent.

“Morrison is very strong and has an
excellent left hook,” Farhood said. “He also
has good size and good punching ability.”

However, Farhood also quickly
pointed out that Morrison needs to do a lot of
work before he gets a championship fight.

“Heneeds to work on his stamina and
defense,” he said. “He also needs to learn to
relax in the ring.”

Morrison’s trainer is Dr. Tom
Virgetts, a former assistant professor at VMI.
The boxer said Virgetts is responsible for
bringing him to VMI.

“{Virgetts] used to coach here from
1979 to 1985,” Morrison said. “It’s a great
atmosphere to be in if you want to totally get
away from everything. It’s almost like being in
prison.”

While at VMI, Morrison said he is
working to improve his defense and add more
weapons to his boxing arsenal.

“My left hook is something I’ve been
noted for for along time” he said. “As you rise
in competition, your opponents get tougher
and you have to learn to rely on other parts of
your arsenal.”

Morrison said he sees a weakness in

Wynton Marsalis and his band will be bringing their form of traditional Jazz to the Lenfest Center on Sunday March 15.

Marsalis grooves into Lenfest

 

By DAVID WILMINGTON
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Wynton Marsalis once said of Duke Ellington’s devotion to jazz and
the blues, “Somewhere out there are the kind of people who will not accept the
premature autopsy of a noble art form.” Marsalis, who will play two shows at
the Lenfest Center March 15, might as well have been describing himself.

With the release of his latest project, a three-part blues cycle collectively
entitled Soul Gestures in Southern Blue, Marsalis has solidified and epitomized
his personal approach to jazz.

He sums up this development as “‘comprehensive and always dealing
with the fundamentals of the music.” For him, the fundamental is, of course, the
blues.

Marsalis says that the “high usage” of the blues is what ties all great
jazz musicians together. The term “high usage” refers to the manipulation and
mastery of all aspects of the blues: the chord changes themselves, the instrumental
technique, the emotional expression and the “groove.”

Despite its disco connotation, the groove is a complex rhythmic
accompaniment to the melodies and harmonies supplied by the horns, piano and
bass.

The man responsible for providing this groove since 1988 is Herlin
“Homey” Riley, the drummer in Marsalis’ band.

During an interview Monday, Riley described Marsalis’ approach to
music as “meticulous,” noting that he considers this the mark of a professional
musician.

He said that playing Marsalis’ music requires great sensitivity to the
subtle changes and definite forms involved.

“It’s not just a bunch of guys getting together to play a gig,” Riley said.

However, Riley said that Marsalis’ clearly delineated forms still allow
plenty of room for expressive soloing.

Riley said his own theory of playing drums consists of “keeping good
time and laying down a cushion of rhythm for the rest of the band.”

His ultimate goal in 2reating music, Riley said, is toreach acompromise
between satisfying himself, the other members of the band, musicians in the
house and the audience.

Riley said that the “instrumental pop music” that masquerades as jazz
is making it difficult for serious young musicians to learn the traditions
necessary to treat jazz as an art. This is an opinion that Marsalis has been known
to express frequently as well, much to the chagrin of the producers of commercial
jazz impostors.

Despite early pressures from the recording industry to produce such
instrumental pop music, Mar salis stuck to the traditions taught by his father and
the legendary drummer and alent scout Art Blakey. The result of his ongoing
history lessons is a startling new style that earns the right to be called new by the
very fact that it encompasses and utilizes so much of the old.

Cuomo
impressed
by MC

By JOSHUA MANNING
Phi Staff Reporter

 

 

Arriving on the Mock Conven-
tion platform 15 minutes late as hun-
dreds of delegates cheered ‘‘draft
Cuomo,”’ perennial presidential possi-
bility and three-term New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo delivered a keynote
address Saturday which catapulted
him into a mock vice-presidential
nomination.

“I’m extremely impressed with
how they do it here,’’ Cuomo said
during a brief press conference after
the speech. ‘‘I went on stage assum-
ing that this was the real Democratic
convention,”’

Rumors that Cuomo might use
the appearance to enter the presiden-
tial race just in time for Super Tues-
day did not come true. The gover-
nor’s speech focused on the failures
of twelve years of Republican presi-
dents.

The Republicans, he said, took
a ‘‘radical theory that failed 65 years
ago’’ called trickle-down, or supply-
side, economics and put it into use.
The current recession is the result of
that failure, Cuomo said.

“*Supply-side wound up supply-
ing the wealthy with bread from the
poor and middle class,’’ Cuomo said.

Accompanying this economic
policy, he continued, were failed at-
tempts at reform, the destruction of
the welfare system, the abandoning of
American cities and the Supreme
Court’s intrusion into personal liber-
ties.

‘*The American dream is gradu-
ally fading as the president seems less
and less capable of leading us to
higher ground,’’ cried Cuomo. ‘‘Even
now, in this winter of our economic
discontent, he has held his course:
straight for the cliff.’’

Cuomo said Bush’s greatest
problem is that he has been unable to
admit that problems exist. Instead he
said the president has been blaming
the powerless for the problems his
administration has created.

“‘Let’s do less blaming and
more building.’’ Cuomo said. ‘‘We
need a whole plan, a real, effective
economic growth strategy based on
inclusion, not exclusion.’’

Cuomo called for a Democratic
agenda based on health care, job
training, family leave for women.

on rebuilding the infrastructure of
American cities and a variety of plans
to help children and students.

““This is not just a handout,’’
Cuomo said. ‘‘We do this as an in-
vestment in our human resources.”’

Cuomo said the money to fund
these programs already exists, it just
needs to be discovered.

said. ‘““How can you say that we have
not the wealth to deal with these
problems? It’s simply a matter of
priorities.”’

The next president of the United
States will have to make many hard
choices, Cuomo said.

‘The Republicans have pro-
duced a calamity,’’ Cuomo said. ‘‘As
in 1932, the Democrats will lead us
out of it, away from the cliff.

“We have to stop making war

concluded. ‘‘I want to be part of a

What if the Democrats threw a
convention, passed a Republican
platform, and nobody came?

By the time the Mock Conven-
tion platform debate ended Friday
night, two things were clear. First,
that the majority of students believe
that the Democrats should adopt more
conservative positions. Second, the
majority of delegates didn’t care to
discuss the platform in the first place.

There were 869 delegate ballots
cast on the first contested plank, but
fewer than 300 on the third.

“‘L_was pleasantly surprised with
how the debate went, and that a lot of
people stayed around,’’ said Platform
Committee Chairman Heath Dixon.
“It wasn’t of the highest academic
quality, but some relevant things were
said. After all, it was Friday night and
people had been drinking.”’

“The platform is necessary to
the convention,”’ said Virginia Chair-
man John Flippen. ‘‘But I think ev-
erybody was ready to go to their keg
parties.’’

All the speakers at the conven-
tion proposed what they called a
‘New Vision’’ for the Democratic
party: a breaking away from the tra-
ditional, liberal moorings that have
characterized the party since the time
of Franklin D. Roosevelt.

And the platform drafted and
passed by the convention reflects this
new, more moderate stance.

Although it contained some
traditional Democratic planks, such as
support for ‘‘reproductive freedom’”’
and reduced defense spending, the
platform’s positions on such issues as
tax credits for industry to encourage
research and development and the
possible elimination of some affir-
mative action programs are much
more conservative than those of past
Democratic platforms.

“It think it’s clear that you can
look around the country and see
things that aren’t going the way they

 

should, even if you’re a Republican,”’ .

Dixon said before the convention.
‘*We tried to propose things that are
different from the traditional, liberal,
interest group platforms that the Dem-
ocrats have put out before.’’

During most of the convention,
delegates were supposed to act like
their real-life counterparts, even if

pass.

a

they had to fake it. But the platform °
debate gave students the chance to «
support their own conservative views.

The platform committee spon- —
sored debate on three of the many
issues addressed in the 12-page docu-
ment. On each of these issues, the —
traditionally-Republican student body
voted overwhelming for the more
conservative of their options.

The first contested issue was
gun control. The platform stated,
““We are opposed to the ease with
which guns may be purchased, ...we »
support federal control of the pur-
chasing process.”

Senior Will Thomas, a member »
of the MC Steering Committee, pre- _
sented the.convention with another,
more conservative option, which ,
eventually was passed 516-353.

“‘Gun control has to be handled
by the states, not the federal govern-
ment,’’ Thomas said. ‘‘Why spend
millions of dollars on a program we
know won’t work?”

The second contested issue
concerned health care. Midwest Re-
gional Coordinator Cottie Miles «
presented a more liberal position than ,
that of the platform: that medical
care, like legal representation, should »
be given freely to those who can’t |
afford it. The minority report was
rejected easily by the convention.

“Health care is already supplied
in an adequate way,’’ Mississippi
Delegation Chairman Richard Yates °
said in response to Miles. ‘“‘To na- |
tionalize it would threaten our right to
the best health care possible.’’

The final issue was tax reform.
Platform Committee member Todd
Ammermann proposed in his minority °
report, which also passed easily, the
same 13-percent flat tax espoused by
Democratic candidate Jerry Brown.

“For too long, we have thought
that to raise taxes was the only solu-
tion,’” Ammermann said. ‘‘What we
need is tax simplicity and fairness.”’

But perhaps the most attention-
getting issue on the convention floor
was on a sign in the California dele-
gation that read ‘‘The Right To Bear
All Full Frontal Nudity.”’

“‘If you’ve got the right to bear
arms, then you’ve got the right to
bare anything else,’’ said Melton, one
of the two delegates holding the sign.
“‘All these issues should be up to the
states. This is just a way to grab .
people’s attention.”’

Although the focus was sup-
posed to be on national issues, it was
the local car tax issue that drew the
attention of speakers in the opening
session of Mock Convention.

Washington and Lee President
John Wilson made the first reference
to the tax in an address welcoming
the convention to W&L. The speech
poked fun at university food, the city
and even the president himself,

“‘While you are here, we invite
you to dine at our four-star restaurant,
visit Old George guarding our cups
and saucers in the Reeves Center and
make sure you register your automo-
bile with the grand assessor of tax-
es,’’ Wilson said.

U.S. Representative Buddy
Darden, D-Ga., told students they
should register to vote in the city if
they wanted to abolish the tax and
pointed to the tax as an example of
why people should vote.

“They are going to do it to you
like this your whole life unless you
vote,’’ Darden said.

Virginia. Democratic Party
Chairman Paul Goldman even invited
students to ‘‘come down and talk to

U.S. Representative Jim Olin (D-Va.) addresses the Mock Convention’s first session.

later said about the offer. ‘‘It sounds
like taxation without representation to
me. I'd be happy to share my experi-
ence and help you talk to people [in
State government].’’

through the afternoon session was the
irony of a largely conservative student
body pretending to be Democrats.

U.S. Representative Jim Olin,
D-Va., got a laugh when he beg2n his
speech by addressing the crowd as
“Fellow Democrats....’’

“When you're older and

said. ‘So for now let’s all be Demo-

The Washington and Lee
men’s lacrosse team has yet to gel
completely this year. The Generals
can play one strong quarter and
follow it with a not-so-strong quarter.

Just take Saturday's game at
Franklin & Marshall.

In the second quarter, the
Generals erased a 3-0 Diplomats lead
to take a 4-3 halftime lead. The
Generals led 6-4, but were shut out in
the fourth quarter as the Diplomats
rallied for a 9-6 win.

“I thought we did a good job
coming back from the early hole,”’
said head coach Jim Stagnitta. ‘‘But
we didn’t play very well, and that put
us in a position where anything could
happen in the fourth quarter, and it
did.”’

The Generals had to kill off
five fourth quarter penalties and never
had a legitimate opportunity mount an
offensive threat. But it wasn’t the
fourth quarter penalties that did W&L

in.

‘*We didn’t shoot the ball well
early,’ Stagnitta said. ‘““We had
opportunities in the second quarter to
put the game away, and we didn’t.
We got stuffed a couple of times, and
we need to convert those shots.”’

W&L scored just six goals on
their 32 shots. Juniors John Hunter
and Wiemi Douoguih each scored
twice to lead the Generals.

The loss to the 13th-ranked
Diplomats served as a wake-up call
for the Generals, ranked seventh in
Division III.

““You never like to lose a
game,’’ said Stagnitta, ‘‘but maybe
we can learn from this loss.”’

The Generals showed some
improvement on Wednesday against
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
foe Lynchburg, but still followed a
good quarter with a not-so-good one.

Stagnitta knew going into the
game that Lynchburg would be a
challenge for his team.

‘“‘Every single time we walk
out on the field, it’s a challenge,’’ he

said. ‘‘We need to play well and
hard, because if we don’t, we’re not
good enough to win.”’

WA&L jumped out to a 5-1 lead
after the first quarter sparked by two
goals from sophomore Colin Higgins,
but watched as Lynchburg took a 6-5
lead late in the second quarter.

The Hornets’ run woke the
Generals up. Douoguih scored to tie
the game at 6-6, senior Drew Anton
scored just 16 seconds before
halftime, and Douoguih scored early
in the second half to give the
Generals an 8-6 lead on the way to a
16-9 win.

Lynchburg made the score 8-7,
but Hunter started W&L on an 8-2
run to finish the game. Hunter’s goal,
his second of the day, was followed
by goals from senior Jeff Roberts and
Anton before the Hornets scored
again to make it 11-8.

The Generals broke the game
open with two straight goals from
junior David Schiminger, the second

coming off an alley-oop feed from
Douoguih.

Douoguih and Anton led
W&L with four goals and an assist
each. Hunter, sophomore Colin
Higgins and Schiminger each added
two goals.

Senior goalie Coleman Devlin
anchored the defense. Devlin saved
12 of the 29 shots he saw. Lynchburg
managed just 11 second-half shots.

W&L improved to 3-2 on the
season, 2-0 in the ODAC. The
Generals will put their 10-game
ODAC winning streak on the line
against 1lth-ranked arch-rival
Roanoke in a game that is important
if W&L wants to return to the NCAA
Division III tournament.

“*TWith the loss to F&M], we
get to see what this team is made
of,’’ said Stagnitta. ‘‘If its goal is to
make it to the tournament, then we’ve
got our work cut out for us.”’

W&L begins its home
schedule on Wednesday. The
Generals host Virginia Wesleyan.

Baseball drops tough double-dip

 

By SEAN O’ROURKE
Phi Staff Reporter

One of the most difficult tasks
for a coach is to keep a team’s
confidence level up after a loss.

Washington and Lee baseball
coach Jeff Stickley has the unenviable
task of trying to keep his young
team’s confidence high after a
double-header loss to Mary
Washington College on Sunday.

However, Coach  Stickley
doesn’t think it will be that difficult.

‘*They’re [MWC] a good
team, a legit tournament team,”” said
Stickley. ‘“‘I think that type of
competition is good for us, it helps
gain experience. I don’t think the
guys are down, we had some decent
opportunities against a very good
team.”’

The Generals did have some
good opportunities in the first game,
but they just couldn’t seem to

 

Senior Richard Yates hammers a forehand in a recent match. Yates
helped lead W&L to a 5-4 win over Hampden-Sydney.

capitalize. Their best chance came in
the second inning of the first game.

With the Eagles up 2-0, senior
T.J. Daly lead off the inning with a
walk, freshman Bates Brown followed
with a single and junior Pete
Klinglehofer followed that with
another single, but Daly couldn’t
score. A double-play and a ground
out killed the rally, though.

‘*We had bases loaded and no
outs, but we just couldn’t get any
runs across,” said Stickley. ‘It was a
good opportunity for us, but it wasn’t
totally disheartening.”’

The Generals held their own
until the bottom of the fourth, when
the Eagles exploded for five runs.
They followed that up with a six-run
fifth to put the game out of reach.

The Generals did make a mini-
comeback in the seventh when they
scored five runs on four hits, but
couldn’t get any closer. The Eagles
claimed the first game 13-5.

The Generals had a chance to
redeem themselves in the unscheduled
night-cap, but it wasn’t to be. Mary
Washington picked up right where
they left off in game one. Six players
crossed home plate in the bottom of
the first and two more in the bottom
of the second.

MWC held the Generals to
just two hits and no runs, and swept
the Generals by winning the second
game 8-0.

Brown had an excellent day
for the Generals going 4-for-6 and
raising his season average to .313.
Klinglehofer also had a good double-
header by going 2-for-6.

The Generals’ pitching staff is
off to a disappointing start with a
team ERA of 8.31. These are not the
type of numbers Stickley was looking
for.

Tennis extends streak

 

By SEAN O’ROURKE
Phi Staff Reporter

 

It’s been ten years since the
Washington and Lee men’s tennis
team lost an Old Dominion Athletic
Conference match. The last team to
top the Generals was Hampden-
Sydney.

Last Thursday the Tigers came
close to ending the Generals decade-
long hold over ODAC opponents. But
W&L squeaked by, 5-4, to extend its
ODAC winning streak to 29,

“Tt ended up being a good

el match for us,” said head coach Gary

Franke.

The Generals took the match
with their singles line-up. Richard
Yates, Robby MacNaughton, Tom
Mazziotti, Wes Ruggles and David
Schweppe all recorded victories. It
took a three-set victory by Mazziotti
at No. 3 singles to clinch it for the
Generals. Mazziotti won the nail-biter

way they’re going to get better is to
face better hitters. I believe they’ll
start to come around and get things
together,’’said Stickley.

“Scoring runs was a problem.
Bates Brown had a good day, but we
weren’t hitting well as a team, and
that’s the only way we're going to
win.”’

The Generals dropped to 2-4
on the season and they were supposed
to start their 1992 Old Dominion
Athletic Conference season at home
Tuesday against Bridgewater but the
game was rained out. It is
rescheduled for Monday at 3 p.m.

So, instead of Bridgewater the
Generals will open the ODAC season
at home against Eastern Mennonite
today. They will stay home for a
double-header on Saturday against
another ODAC rival, Randolph-
Macon.

6-4, 4-6, 6-3. He was the last singles
player to finish, and his win insured
the team win for W&L, regardless of
doubles.

‘*‘We won third singles, so we
had them beaten,’’ said Franke. ‘‘I
believe we just let up a little too
much in the doubles and lost them.”’

The win upped the Generals
season mark to 4-0, 3-0 in the
ODAC. However, Franke still isn’t
sure if his team is where it should be.

‘It’s kind of hard to tell if the
kids are match-tough yet,’’ he said.

The Generals played James
Madison today. It is the first of three
tough matches for the Generals. After
hosting JMU, W&L hits the road for
matches at Emory and Davidson on
Saturday and Sunday, respectively.
Both are ranked natioanlly.

“‘They’re going to be tough
matches, and either way it turns out
it’ll tell me where the team stands.”’

Generals win three straight

The Washington and Lee
women’s lacrosse team opened the
1992 season with three straight wins
against conference opponents.

In the best start in school
history, W&L ran off impressive
victories against Old Dominion
Athletic Conference foes Guilford,
Sweet Briar, and Bridgewater.

The Generals have done it
with offense and defense alike. That
control was most apparent in a re-
cord-breaking performance against
SBC.

The Generals poured in 19
goals, the highest total in W&L histo-
ry, and also recorded the first shutout
ever in the 19-0 win over the Vixens.

In a game filled with individu-

al stars, Annie Salisbury led the way
with five goals and three assists for a
school-record eight points. Lisa
Dowling had four goals and an assist,
and both Paige Henke and Nicole
Ripken netted three goals each.

The team showed the potential
to improve on last year’s record in
the first game of the season, as they
easily handled Guilford 15-2.

W&L was led offensively by
Dowling and Angie Carrington. Each
had four goals and two assists. Kim
Bishop also contributed four goais.

On Wednesday, Bridgewater
gave the Generals a closer game, but
the Generals still were able to control
the game, winning 8-4.

The Generals will attempt to
continue their winning ways at Ran-
dolph-Macon on Saturday.

It is Dudley’s third straight
trip to the NCAA meet. She will

Dudley earned All-America

weekend.

 

Washington and Lee’s golf
team, a top 10 finisher at the last
two NCAA Division III Champion-
ships, tees it up for the first time in
1992 this weekend at the Gordin
Collegiate Classic in Surfside
Beach, S.C.

 

The event is one of the
most prestigious in any division of
collegiate golf and draws the best
teams in Division II]. W&L fin-
ished seventh in last year’s event.

The Generals will be led by
All-American seniors Brad Tho-
burn, Jay McKnight and Clay
Thomas. Cliff Burrow and Pearce
Smithwick will also make the trip

The Washington and Lee
Athletics Promotions Committee is
sponsoring ‘‘Varsity Days’’ this

from each out-of-season team to
come out and support in-season
athletes. Other students are wel-
come to support teams as well.

On Friday, there will be
two events sponsored. At the track
meet against Bridgewater, the
W&L Food Services will be giving
away free food and drinks for
everyone who attends. At the
women’s tennis match against
Denison, free Domino’s Pizza will
be given away.
