Trustees up
tuition by
6.5 percent

By JASON KELLEY
Phi Editor

 

 

The Board of Trustees approved a tuition hike of six
and a half percent for next year, an increase that outpaces
inflation by more than two percent.

Undergraduate tuition for 1992-93 will be $12,330, up
from this year’s $11,575 fee. Law students will pay
$12,830 next year instead of this year’s $12,050.

The board, acting at its Feb. 15 meeting in
Washington, D.C., also approved room and board rate
increases. University housing will cost from $1500 to
$2300 next year and full board at the Evans Dining Hall
will run $2400.

For example, a single room in a suite in Gaines Hall
that costs $2130 this year will run $2200 next year.

University Treasurer Lawrence Broomall said his
office requested the increases based on projected expenses
and revenues for next year.

Broomall said increased staff compensation and other
outlays led to a projected expense increase, while certain
factors in the economy will slow down the growth of non-
tuition revenues.

The increase ‘‘is nothing we have to apologize for,”’
he said. ‘‘Our tuition level is still lower than that of similar
universities.”’

Broomall said faculty and administration salaties and
benefits are increasing.

“Fringe benefits have gone up substantially. Our
medical plan has faced 20 and 30 percent increases in
premiums in the last two years,’’ Broomall said.

He said the university must continue to increase
faculty salaries despite the weak economy to remain
competitive with other comparable schools.

According to John DeCourcey, W&L’s financial aid
director, the trustees also increased the total financial aid
available to students by about 14 percent. He noted that no
tuition money goes toward financial aid. Instead aid comes
from endowed scholarships and a special fund specifically
for financial aid.

DeCourcey said his office has seen an increase in
requests for aid recently, and with the tuition hike, they
expect even more.

‘You've got a lousy economy and people who
weren’t on financial aid before are coming in to see me
now about it,’’ DeCourcey said.

__He. said his office had requested that the board
approve close to $3 million for aid next year. The board
approved $2.7 million.

The Student Affairs Committee
reduced Delta Tau Delta’s punishment
for vandalizing its house to a one-
year suspension and three subsequent
years of critical probation Tuesday,
following university President John
Wilson’s recommendation.

Last month SAC suspended Delt
for five years after members of the
chapter broke windows, knocked
down walls, removed ceiling tiles,
disassemble lofts and destroyed a
brick bar before moving out of the
house on Dec. 22.

But President Wilson recommen-
ded that the penalty be reduced after
he investigated the situation in res-
ponse to Delt’s appeal.

“The penalty needed to be re-
thought,’” he said. ‘‘At the hearing
SAC held with chapter leaders and
the house corporation, SAC wasn’t
able to get to all of the circumstances
surrounding the last few weeks of fall
term [when the damage occurred].””

“T think the penalty ... should
punish the current chapter without
jeopardizing the prospect of a re-
newed and strengthened presence of
the fraternity at Washington and
Lee,’’ the president wrote in his rec-
ommendation to SAC.

President Wilson said SAC was
unable to completely understand
Delt’s situation during the original
hearing because SAC was investigat-
ing the nature of the destruction while
the chapter wanted to focus on its
plan for correcting the situation.

 

 

Sophomore Angie Carrington works against senior Whitney Hopkins in a
women’s lacrosse practice. Carrington and the Generals will open their season
March 7 on the Liberty Hall Field against Guilford.

He said he spoke extensively with
Delt President Robert Wilson, Vice
President Pat McCabe and House
Corporation President Taylor Cole,
°75, in order to determine the motiva-
tion for the damage.

SAC slices
Delt sentence

Panel follows Wilson’s advice

“There were elements I thought
were intentional and malicious [like
the destruction of the bar], and others
reflected a dissatisfaction with the
way their renovation plan had been
drawn up,”’ President Wilson said.

But the graffiti on the walls was
not malicious or vulgar, he said. The
broken furniture and other trash was
not cleaned up because the members
were moving out for renovation, the
president said, and they expected the
construction company would tear the
house apart anyway.

The new penalty, which takes
effect immediately, suspends the cha-
pter until July 1, 1993, but invites
Delt to apply for renovation by Aug.
15, 1992. If the application is ap-
proved, renovation would begin in
September on the Delt house and be
completed by Sept. 1, 1993.

SAC also asked Delt’s interna-
tional fraternity to turn over the chap-
ter’s charter to an ad hoc alumni
committee. The alumni committee
and the Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent would review the chapter’s cur-
rent members and remove those who
do not support the fraternity’s ideals
and the university’s ‘‘Standards for
Fraternities,’” according to a memo
detailing SAC’s decision.

Cole said that Delt would want to
participate in Renaissance.

“I’m very grateful that the presi-
dent decided to review the situation
and make a recommendation to the
Student Affairs Committee that I
believe helped with the penalty reduc-
tion,’’ Cole said. ‘‘I know the alumni
will be thankful that he interceded.”’

Robert Wilson said he thinks the
revised penalty is fair and Delt will
be able to rush successfully in 1993.

“More or less [the five-year
suspension] would have been a death
penalty,’’ he said.

Construction of an $800,000 art gallery on
Washington and Lee’s front campus will begin as
early as April.

Final approval of the project was granted by
the Board of Trustees at its meeting Feb. 15,
despite strong opposition to the location of the
gallery by students and faculty.

““Student concems were very strongly
considered,’’ said Brian Shaw, W&L director of
communications. ‘‘In the end, the board decided
that this was the best location for the building.”’

The gallery will house a collection of
Oriental ceramics, jades, and furnishings donated to
the university by Mrs. William Watson of Lynch-
burg. Watson, whose husband graduated from
W&L in 1929, is also donating $800,000 for con-
struction of the gallery.

Students circulated a petition in October to
oppose the location of the gallery, which will be lo-

lably big crowd,” he said.

Jim Olin (D-Va.) and Buddy Darden (D-

The second session is at 7:30 p.m.
Friday. Former Speaker of the House
Thomas ‘‘Tip’’ O’Neill and former Mas-
sachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis will

will have their own passes to get onto the
convention floor.

Donaldson said free passes for ses-
sions will be available to students and
their guests through the MC office in the
University Center. Passes will also be
handed out at the MC memorabilia sales
next week, also in the University Center.

Remaining passes will be available

cated between Tucker Hall and the Reeves Center.
Shaw said many faculty members also sent
letters to the Board of Trustees and the administra-
tion in opposition to the location of the gallery.
The board then delayed making a decision
on the gallery until they considered other locations.
Shaw said the board considered three
alternative sites, two in the gully across from the
Alumni House and one behind the Lenfest Center.
All three sights were rejected by the board.
Beverly M. DuBose, chairman of the bo-
ard’s capital planning committee, said the board
determined that the architecture and location of the
gallery were compatible with the front campus.
According to the architect’s model, the
gallery will be constructed of red brick with white
columns to conform to the surrounding buildings.
Shaw said the board voted unanimously to
approve the location and style of the gallery.
“They felt that the Watson Gallery needed
to be in close proximity to the Reeves Center for
them to complement each other,’’ Shaw said. ‘“The

other locations were just not close enough.”’

Construction of the gallery is being delayed
while architects decide whether the new gallery can
be connected to the Reeves Center by an under-
ground tunnel.

Shaw said the tunnel from the Reeves
Center will probably be the only entrance or exit so
that access to the gallery can be more easily con-
trolled.

Shaw said that when the Watson Gallery is
completed, he expects to see more students use the
Reeves Center.

Shaw said students will be able to research
the origins of Chinese porcelain and jade back to
the 10th century using the Watson collection.

‘*T think that the Reeves Center will become
a more viable part of the university with the addi-
tion of the Watson Gallery,’’ Shaw said. ‘‘It will
add tremendously to East Asian arts studies.’’

Shaw said Watson will bequeath money for
a professorship in East Asian studies to the univer-
sity at the time of her death.

Warner Center, Donaldson said. ‘‘If room

Young said the passes are a good
idea so the gym is not overcrowded.

The university’s alcohol policy will
apply to all MC events, including the
Friday morning parade, Young said. ‘‘In
the past it’s been a problem.”

Young said ABC officers will be on
hand at the parade, as will Lexington
police officers.

Young said security members will
be watching for alcohol at float construc-
tion.

““We’re concerned about the safety
of people on the floats,’’ he said.

The Confidential Review Committee’s self-evalua-
tion is complete, but will not be released to the university
community until next week.

Dean of Students David L. Howison said he has
received the results of the CRC’s six-month long investi-
gation into possible procedural reforms. He will present
the report to the Student Affairs Committee Friday, after
which it will become a public document.

‘‘From the beginning, the report was supposed to be

a report to the SAC,’” CRC Chairman and Associate
Professor of Law Joan M. Shaughnessy said. “‘I have left
the decision of when it will be spread beyond that
committee to Dean Howison.”’

Howison said he wanted SAC to see the report
before it is released.

He said the report will be considered by SAC until
early April, when it will be presented along with SAC
recommendations to the faculty. He said the faculty will
vote on any changes to the CRC in May.

‘*We will have a enough time to look at the review
very carefully,’’ Howison said

Meanwhile, students are being asked to fill out a
survey about the CRC by members of a research class
taught by Professor of Sociology David R. Novack.

Novack said the survey is a class project, but the
results will be made available to anybody who is interest-
ed. He said the project should be finished in three to four
weeks.

Howison said SAC would welcome any input from
the survey, if it is completed on time, but SAC will
concentrate on the CRC report.

“‘We are not building our review around the
survey,’’ Howison said

That’s the home phone number of Lexington Mayor
Homer E. Derrick Jr.

We bring Homer’s phone number to your attention this
week because it’s the best way we can think of for
Washington and Lee students to voice their disapproval
of the car tax, the latest bills for which were recently
mailed out.

The way we see it, if the mayor is willing to put his
home number in the phone book, then he’s got to figure
that someone might call. So we suggest you take Homer
up on it.

If he answers, we'd like you to tell him that the car
tax is an unfair infringement on people who live here
nine months a year yet have no voice in city government.

If Homer doesn’t hang up after that, you might
mention that W&L students and their families constitute
a large percentage of the city’s income through such
means as shopping in town and paying the inevitable
parking tickets.

At this point in the conversation, Homer may become
somewhat hostile. But don’t worry; just keep talking. Tell
him that, although the university is exempt from local
property taxes, W&L gives the city large amounts of
money each year so that the city might recover some of
that lost income.

If that doesn’t work, try reminding Homer that the
university, as part of the Master Plan, donated over
$100,000 to the city so that it could build the Rockbridge
Consolidated High School. Or perhaps you should
mention that the city will net littlke money from what
amounts to little more than an attempt to harass students
who are not as well off as many city residents think.

Homer is by nature a very understanding man. We’re
sure he won’t mind taking time out from his day to hear
your concerns. So go ahead — give him a call.

 

Hooray for
progress

Guess what boys and girls! Starting next year, on
your way from the language lab to clapping for credit,
you can stop by and research some tenth century mugs
and saucers. And if those crazy W&L architects have
their way, you will even be able to take the secret tunnel
eastward toward the Reeves Center where you can
research some 18th century dinnerware. And that’s not
the best part of the deal the trustees have cooked up for
us. You know that dreadful grassy area by Tucker Hall?
Yeah, the one with the shade trees and squirrels. That'll
be bulldozed in April to make way for more bricks and
mortar.

All sarcasm aside, while we understand how dishes do
add to the prestige of any institution, we just can’t for
the life of us figure why they gotta be put in one of the
last green areas on the Hill. It’s probably too late to
change things, but if we had our way, those dishes would
be put in the Lenfest Center where people who like
delicate things hang out.

Oh, by the way, if the trustees are interested, we got
a great deal on 23,462 place settings of very small, late
20th century silverware at a Pan Am liquidation sale.
We’d be glad to donate them to the university if they can
promise they’ll build an adobe museum on that terrible
grassy patch between Washington Hall and Lee Chapel.

College cheats start
on a slippery slope

 

My VIEW

By Erma Bombeck

 

Michael Moore, a 24-year-old junior at
Rutgers State University, thinks he is breaking
new ground with his paperback, “‘Cheating
101: The Benefits and Fundamentals of Eam-
ing the Easy A.”’

His dream of elevating cheating to an art
form offers such i as wearing a
Walkman, using the stick-shift method (which
indicates multiple choice directions) and being
paged by a beeper during a test and getting
answers from friends on an outside phone.

You call that creative? I knew people in
college who cheated 30 years ago. They
wrote answers on breath mints and ate the
evidence, recorded answers on the ends of
their fingernails and then bit them off. A few
put notes on the soles of their shoes, and
several rummaged through wastebaskets in the
mimeograph room looking for master sheets.

But there is one glaring difference. The
“‘they’’ were scum who were dishonest and
brought shame and embarrassment to a uni-
versity. Without integrity, they missed what
education was all about. They were neither
admired, accepted or the stuff of which books
were written.

According to Moore: ‘‘It’s understood
between students that cheating is a reality.
You take it for granted that they have [cheat-
ed] in the past and will in the future.”’

I want to be disgusted with Michael Mo-

ore, but he has to wait his turn, First, I have
to show my real contempt for politicians who
lie and captains of industry who are con-
sumed with greed, for plumbers who over-
charge and lawyers dedicated to exploitation,
for law enforcement officers who take advan-
tage of people’s trust and writers who accept
Pulitzer Prizes for stories they invented.

They are the ones who paved the way for
Michael Moore’s book. Before any of us is
too complacent about putting the blame on
those mentioned above, look into your own
lives. What kind of message are you sending
to your children?

You can’t break into a car, but it’s OK to
fish without a license.

You can’t steal a bicycle, but it’s all right
to filch a few office supplies.

Don’t lie to your mother, but you can’tell
the person at the box office you’re big for 1!.

The. fall from integrity doesn’t happen
when you stub your toe over a large lie in
your path. It’s stumbling along a rough road
mined with one decision after another of what
is right and what is wrong.

The important thing to remember is that a
lot of books have been and will continue to
be written on ‘‘cheating.’”’ Most of the au-
thors, however, are serving time.

LET IT RIDE

 

By Chris Swann

Mock Convention: booze, ticker tape and Democrats.
Who would’ve pictured it at W&L (the booze, not the
Democrats, that is)? This is an event so famous (or infa-
mous) that the Virginia ABC board has bottles of Jim
Beam made with Mock Con labels.

Being like most of you, and deeply concerned with
politics, the Democratic party and Election Day, I have
volunteered my time and effort to lend whatever help I
could to Mock Convention. The Steering Committee,
however, found little use in a somewhat-humorous colum-
nist, so I gritted my teeth and joined a state delegation. As
a result, I have spent hours fretting about the political
makeup of Texas, a large and somewhat dubious area to the
Southwest.

Politics is a strange
animal, like a cat: you

‘Who all’s in have to stroke it just the
the parade? right way to get any reac-

; tion. This is especially
Well, we've got true of Democratic state
Dukakis, Tip chairmen or, more specifi-

cally, of their secretaries.
How many times can one
be put on that awful limbo
of the business world,
“‘hold?’’ It boggles the
imagination. I am a mem-
ber of the Texas political
committee, and as such I have spent innumerable hours
(three) on the phone to a state in which I have never set
foot so I can ask the executive director of the Texas
Democratic Party exactly what he thinks of Paul Tsongas.
Since that particular candidate has all the personality of a
dead mouse, I can guess his answer, but state delegations
need official comments.

Behind the calm facade of the Mock Convention
office room lies confusion, panic and punchy humor. The
Steering Committee deserves either a large amount of cash,
or alcohol (preferably both), for their efforts in managing
this mess. To fully appreciate what this is like, here are
some excerpts from genuine conversations:

‘Donkeys? Hell yeah, we got donkeys. They’re
coming in from Natural Bridge.”’

“OK, Dukakis comes in at 11:45. At 12:37 he has to
be in the press conference room, you'll say ‘Hello, wel-
come to Mock Convention,’ all that BS, then get him in the
car by 1:14...””

“Hello, my name is Chris Swann and I’m calling
from Washington and Lee University. I'd like to talk to Mr.
Slagle about the Democratic — yes, I'll hold.”

‘‘And he said L.L. Bean won’t support Maine ‘cause
they only contribute to certain people, so I said, ‘Really,
well I only shop at certain stores, screw you.””’

“‘He’s not there? Well, when-do you expect him in?
Well, can I leave a message? How about a phone number?
Excuse me, but do you speak any English whatsoever?’’

‘‘Who all’s in the parade? Well, we’ve got Dukakis,
Tip O'Neill, Mario Cuomo and Miss Teen Rockbridge.”

“‘Tsongas’ secretary is more boring than he is.”’

“Hello, this is Edward Blake from the National
Enquirer, we have a rumor that Bill Clinton was seen
dancing naked on stage at the 1988 Mock Convention,
could you confirm or deny that, please?’ — actual phone
call, I swear to God.

‘*Tucker’s not here. You want to talk to John Donald-
son? How about Jay? Well, who the hell am I supposed to
pass the ball to?’’

“The Lexington police? Oh, they love us. We’re
giving them a reason to exist.”’

“So what is Dukakis riding in, a convertible, a limo,
what? Oh hell, just put him in a tank.””

‘‘Hello, this is — yes, I'll hold.”’

O’Neill, Mario
Cuomo and Miss
Teen Rockbridge.’

Exercise your
right to vote

To the Editor:
I must disagree with Mr. MacKenzie’s

to the corrupt nature of our democratic system
and government. Although I am not enamored

not, I truly believe that voting is necessary and
simply one of the greatest rights in our Constitu-
tion.

When I was a lofty 18-year-old undergradu-
ate, I voted for issues: legislation against land-
fills, legislation against gambling, legislation for
the appropriation of lands as animal reserves and
occasionally I had the pleasure of voting for a
candidate who best represented views similar to
mine. Not all I wanted became law — most
notably, gambling was not legalized in my home
state — but believe it or not, many issues I did
want became law.

After putting myself through college, I
entered the work force and, subsequently, paid
more taxes, health and car insurance, and rent —
just to name a few of the more mundane aspects
of life after college. Then, as an inspired, idealis-
tic 23-year-old, I decided I wanted to travel, so I
sold my car and hit Europe, then moved to Japan
for a year. It was the only year I did not vote.
But, trite as it may sound, if you have ever
traveled extensively and studied a foreign coun-
try, you will realize just how powerful the Ameri-
can voting right is... but I do not presume to
know if Mr. MacKenzie has ever had the oppor-
tunity to broaden his visions outside the continen-
tal United States.

Lastly, as a practical 31-year-old, with a
child, mortgage, more health and car insurance
and a third-year law husband, I not only vote to
express my ideology, but also because of tax
legislation, school boards, sheriffs, health insur-
ance and senatorial wage increases.

Although the motivations for voting and the
reasons for casting your votes in particular ways
may change, there is always a good reason to
vote. If you abdicate your responsibility to vote,
you guarantee your voice on the issues will never
be heard in any meaningful way. Even one whose
views are as misguided as Mr. MacKenzie’s
sound should avail himself of the right to vote.

 

 
   

recent opinion regarding the evils of voting due

with the way the government operates, or does

 

LETTERS

Again, I haven’t ‘‘won’’ on all the issues,
but voting is one of the most painless and cheap-
est ways of getting my point across.

Simply, Mr. MacKenzie, when you no
longer get tax rebates, when you have to pay for
your own car and health insurance, when a
cogeneration plant puts a bid in your community,
when your child goes to public school, when
your park’s 100-year-lease expires, you may just
want to vote — that is, if you have an opinion or
care.

But I must admit, if Mr. MacKenzie aspires
to run for a political office, he would inspire me
NOT TO VOTE for him.

Registered-to-votely yours,
Martha Miller, Law Wife ’92

Leap babies have
reasons to party

To the Editor:

Finally, I must admit the truth. I am 5, and
I am Washington and Lee student. I can’t hide
any longer. It is time I came out of the closet and
faced reality — I am a leap baby. I’m birth-
dicapped. A leap-er. The world’s youngest Re-
publican. I need help, counseling. I need a birth-
day!

Well, it’s not quite that bad. The “‘Happy
Fifth Birthday”’ cards are already pouring in. It’s
always been fun having the rarest of birthdays.
However, it was quite frustrating trying to explain
to my elementary school classmates that I wasn’t
really only two years old, Equally so, arguing in
junior high school that I was allowed to have a
party on another day. Being a leap baby has
certainly had its advantages — I’ve gotten out of
a heck of a lot of birthday punches!

True, I technically can’t vote until 2044,
drink until 2056 or run for president until the
year 2112. And in 2232, retirement!

But, hey, it’s not a birth-defect. So, come
this Saturday, leap-ers of the world unite, it’s
your birthday!!

Sincerely,
Keith E. Grant, Leap Class °72, W&L °94

 
   

MDA Superdance
breaks its goal

To the Editor:

We along with Joe Slay, 72, would like to
give our thanks to all of those that helped contri-
bute to MDA Superdance this year. Not only did
Superdance reach its goal but surpassed it. The
total amount raised was $30,024! This money is
earmarked for research in the area of Spinal
Muscular Atrophy, Andrew Slay’s particular
disease. Speeding up the research, the money
raised will also help buy additional technology
and equipment needed in the gene decoding pro-
cess. Many people and organizations devoted
time and energy into helping make this event
possible and successful. Committee members,
pledges, faculty, administration, parents, citizens

Candidate clarifies
SCC comments

To the Editor:

I wish to correct a statement in your Febru-
ary 6, 1992 issue of The Ring-tum Phi. | did not
say that the SCC ‘‘is not the right place for
sensitive matters.’’ I believe that the SCC is
completely capable of handling issues of verbal
harassment. I also believe that the SCC is not the
appropriate avenue for matters of a sexual nature.
Obviously, an elected group of students with the
power to ask someone to leave the university is
capable of handling a sensitive issue. I have
confidence in the class officers and in the SCC as
a whole.

Sincerely,
Blair Hixson, °94

Kirkland jazzes u

    

 

By Basui SINHA
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Kenny Kirkland, one of the
most acclaimed young pianists in jazz
today, will play at the Lenfest Center
at 8 p.m. Feb. 28.

As a musician equally at
home playing European classical, jazz,
Afro-Cuban, rock, fusion and rhythm
and blues, Kirkland promises to be an
exciting performance.

Kirkland said the program
will feature music from his latest al-
bum, Kenny Kirkland, which spent 13
weeks in the top ten on Billboard
magazine’s Traditional Jazz Album
chart and was hailed as a “Best of
1991” pick by USA Today and the
L.A. Daily News.

The L.A. Daily News also
praised a performance by Kirkland’s
quintet.

“In one of the most fiery and
involving acoustic jazz performances
seen in some time, pianist Kirkland
led asuperb group ... through a set of
futuristic music that was nothing but
arcane,” the newspaper article said.

Most of the album consists
of Kirkland’s original contemporary
jazz compositions, he said, although
he does interpret the works of great
jazz artists like Bud Powell, Wayne
Shorter, Ornette Coleman and
Thelonious Monk.

Kirkland is currently
interested in Afro-Cuban music and
Latin rhythms. He spent several years
working with the Afro-Cuban jazz
ensemble The Fort Apache Band.

“Jerry Gonzales from Fort
Apache and the percussionist Don
Allias, they are my teachers, they’ve
hooked me up with Afro-Cuban
music,” he said in an interview in The

MH

INNS

New York Times.

Kirkland said his mother is
Puerto Rican, and he grew up listening
to Afro-Cuban music so it is natural to
him.

“I feel I can be more
rhythmically exploratory with Latin
rhythms than I can be with mainstream
jazz,” he said.

Kirkland, who is from
Brooklyn, N.Y., said he began playing
piano atthe age of six, after convincing
his father to buy one.

“T lost interest after a few
lessons and wanted to quit, but my
i wasn’t going for that,” Kirkland
said.

Kirkland said he did not
develop his passion for jazz until he
began studying at the prestigious
Manhattan School of Music, where
he was influenced by Herbie
Hancock’s album Headhunters. He
said he then switched his major from
classical performance to theory and
composition.

Nonetheless, Kirkland said
he remains partial to the piano.

“T play electric keyboards
for certain effects, but the acoustic
piano is my first love,” he said.

After touring with the likes
of Branford and Wynton Marsalis and
Sting, Kirkland said, he is just
beginning his solo career. His “special
projects” for the future include playing
with Wynton Marsalis on the Jay Leno
Show in May, he said.

The concert is sponsored by
the Student Activities Board, and will
feature Kirkland andhis quintet, which
includes Charnett Moffett on bass,
Jeff “Tain” Watts on drums, Joe Ford
on saxophone and Milto Cardona on
percussion. Tickets are on sale for $5
in front of the Co-op this week.

Seniors lead W&L
scoring explosion

 

By JAY PLOTKIN
Phi Sports Editor

 

Seniors Jeff Roberts scored four
goals and had four assists to lead the
Washington and Lee men’s lacrosse
team to a season-opening 25-8 win
over Greensboro Wednesday.

“It’s a good start to the season,”
said head coach Jim Stagnitta.

Senior Drew Anton scored four
first-half goals as the Generals
jumped out to an 114 lead.
Greensboro had tied the score at 2-2,
but Anton sparked a W&L run that
pushed the lead out to 9-2.

The run included five goals in the
first 3:18 of the second quarter.
Junior Wiemi Douoguih, Roberts,
Anton, sophomore Colin Higgins and
junior John Hunter did the scoring.

W&L then got three goals each
from Roberts and Higgins as part of

a 9-0 third quarter run to nail the
door shut on the Hornets.

“Our seniors stepped up like
we've waited for them to do,”’ said
Stagnitta. ‘“Drew [Anton] and Jeff
[Roberts] had an opportunity to take
charge, and they took control early.””

Eleven different Generals scored
goals, Juniors John Hunter, Douoguih
and David Lefkowitz each scored
twice, as did freshmen Andy Dutton
and Matt Willis. Junior David
Schiminger had a goal and dished out
three assists. Freshmen Michael
Alessi and Ty Tydings also scored.

‘We played a lot of people, and
they responded,’’ Stagnitta said.
‘*Schiminger has come into his own
and has gotten a lot accomplished.
The freshmen — [Andy] Dutton,
[Shawn] McKenzie, [Ty] Tydings and
[Michael] Alessi — did a nice job.
They'll be a big part of what we'll do

this year.”’

Defensivley, the Generals held
Greensboro to just four goals in the
first three quarters. Senior Coleman
Devlin and junior David Hunter
anchored the defense, which held
Greensboro to just 14 second-half
shots. W&L got off 56 shots on the
day, 29 in the second half.

‘I believe the kids will hit their
peaks at the end of the season at the
championship meets.”’

Washington and Lee men’s
swimming coach Page Remillard
made that comment in the beginning
of January. It is now the
championship season for the
Generals, and by the looks of things,
Remillard’s prediction was right on
the money.

But before the Generals could
worry about their championship meet,
they had to finish up their dual meet
season. The Generals ended their
season with a convincing 133-49 win
over Radford. It was the team’s fifth
victory in a row and upped their
record to 7-4, a major improvement

 

over last year’s 1-5 finish.

The Generals won eight of the
ten events against Radford despite
most swimmers not swimming in
their regular events. Still, Remillard
said, the team looked good.

‘We're definitely happy with
the Radford times,”’ he said. ‘“They
swam off events to help fine tune for
the invitational, but they showed that
they are ready to swim their season-
best times.”’

Senior captain Doug Brown and
freshman John Rowe each won twice.
Brown took the 200-yard and 500-
yard freestyles. Rowe won the 400-
yard individual medley and the 100-
yard backstroke.

Junior Andrew Pearson swam
off with 50-yard freestyle, and

freshman Derek DeVries rounded out
the first-place finishers by winning

100-yard butterfly.

The 7-4 record is the best since
the 1989-90 season, but that is not the
goal the team set for themselves at
the beginning of the season. The team
wanted to show that they belonged
with the major Division III schools
like Wabash and DePauw, Remillard
said.

They get their chance today at
DePauw University in Indiana, where
the Generals begin swimming in the
three-day Liberal Arts Invitational.

“This team is anxious to show
what they can do with the big guys of
Division III swimming,’’ said Coach
Remillard. ‘There is really no outside
pressure on them, just their drive to
do well, and I believe they are going
to do well.”’

Dudley reaches NCAAs

 

By ERIN MCKINNEY
Phi Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
women’s swim team walked away
from the Atlantic States
Championships and the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference Championships
with two second place finishes last
weekend, thanks largely in part to a
different scoring system.

In the ODAC portion of the
meet at Radford, a new scoring
method gave higher scores to lower
finishers. This helped Hollins College
end W&L’s streak of four ODAC
Championships, 660 to 609 although
WA&L actually won more races.

In the Atlantic States portion of

I’m very comfortable with both of the meet, W&L finished second to

them in the goal.”’
The Generals, ranked eighth in
Lacrosse Magazine’s pre-season poll,

the host school. Junior Claire Dudley
did everything she could to avoid that
result, though. She qualified for the

return to action Saturday against NCAA Championship meet by
traditional state rival Virginia in Winning the 200-yard breaststroke
Charlottesville. The Cavaliers are with a school-record time of 2:30.49.

ranked sixth in Division I.

Dudley also took first place in
the 200-yard individual medley and

the 100-yard breaststroke. Her three
wins earned her Swimmer of the
Meet honors for the Atlantic States
meet.

Senior Jodi Herring shined in
the ODAC meet. She captured first
place in both the 100-yard and in the
200-yard butterfly. She also finished
second in the 500-yard freestyle race.
Herring’s performance won _ her
Swimmer of the Meet honors for the
ODAC meet.

Coach Kiki Jacobs was
impressed with the Generals relay
teams, who won all four races.

“They won all of the relay
races in the ODAC meet and 3 out of
the 5 in the Atlantic States,’’ she said.

Every W&L swimmer claimed
a season-best time last weekend.

Jacobs stressed that the Generals
lost once again strictly because they
only have nine swimmers.

“*We lost because of numbers,
not because of our swimming,’’ she
said.

The Washington and Lee
basketball team saw its season end
one game shy of the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference tournament.

A loss at Eastern Mennonite
over Washington Holiday dashed
W&L’s tourney hopes, but the
Generals still finished with a hope
for a strong 1992-92.

After beating Mary
Washington Feb. 17 78-62 behind
19 points from senior captain Mark
Melton and 15 from junior Bryan
Watkins, the Generals fell behind
early at EMC before having to foul

 

 

Generals’ season ends with loss

to catch up.

The Royals thwarted W&L’s
effort by making 30 of 39 free
throws for the game. Vaughn
Troyer hit all 13 of his foul shots
and scored 30 points to lead EMC
to an 80-74 win.

Sophomore Paul Baker scored
a career-high 24 points to lead the
Generals, and sophomore Robert
Miggins added 12 points and 11
rebounds. W&L went to the foul
line just six times on the night.

The loss eliminated W&L
from the ODAC tournament picture,
but W&L still needed a win against
Randolph-Macon to close out the
season on a high note.

The Yellow Jackets, though,
got 20 points from Jeff Taylor and
scored 29 of their 66 points from
the foul line in stopping W&L 66-
53.

Miggins scored two quick
baskets to cut R-MC’s halftime lead
to just 34-31 to start the second
half, but W&L could get no closer
despite a career-best 22 points from
freshman John Rogers.

WA&L ends the season with a
7-18 record, 3-15 in the ODAC.
Next year, the Generals return five
of their top six scorers from this
year’s team, including Watkins
(14.4) and Baker (10.2). a
