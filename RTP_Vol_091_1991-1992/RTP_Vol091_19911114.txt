SAC votes to support
new black fraternity

 

By Joshua Manning
Staff Reporter

 

The Student Affairs Committee
voted Nov. 1 to support the propo-
sed re-establishment of Washington
and Lee’s chapter of historically
black fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha.

SAC President and Dean of Stu-
dents David Howison announced the
decision to the presidents of W&L’s
16 existing fraternities Thursday,
Nov. 7.

Howison said the decision reflect-
ed the committee’s commitment to
student self-determination.

‘*The SAC believes the interested
students have the right to try and
make this thing work,’ Howison
said. ‘‘We did not want to stand in
their way.”’

W&L had a chapter of Alpha Phi
Alpha in the 1970s, but it dissolved.
About 10 students asked the uni-
versity to look into reviving the frat-
ermnity, Howison said.

SAC, made up of faculty mem-
bers and leaders of student govern-
ment, has been discussing the issue
since May.

According to the Interfraternity
Council constitution, after a propos-
ed fraternity gains approval from
SAC, it must also be accepted by a
three-fourths vote from IFC.

Howison said SAC approved the
fraternity only after they were sure it
would be able to conform to the
IFC’s rules.

“SAC only considered it as a
social fraternity,’’ Howison said. ‘‘I

Meese praises Supreme Court

Former U.S. Attorney General
Edwin Meese III came to Lee Chapel
Tuesday night to sing the praises of
a Supreme Court he sees beginning
to leave behind the recent tradition of
judicial legislation.

chip away at Roe v. Wade, the 1973
decision legalizing abortion, as it has
in recent decisions.

‘Once they get in the legislating
business, they find they have to keep
going,’’ he said. ‘‘I suspect they’ll
nibble at the edges of Roe v. Wade
until they have one of the more clear
cut cases where they will have to go
to the root and overturn it.

“‘T just get the impression that he
was some sort of a sneaky charac-
ter,’’ said one junior.

As Attorney General from 1985-
88, Meese met with considerable
criticism and charges of politicizing
his office. He was twice investigated
by special prosecutors of Congress’
independent counsel, once for alleged

 

financial misdoings and once for the
Wedtech scandal involving Meese
aids accused of taking illegal pay-
ments. Meese was cleared of any
wrongdoing in both cases.

In a question and answer’ session
following his speech on the history of
the federal judiciary, Meese said the
Supreme Court would continue to

Che Ring-tum Phi

Founded September 18, 1897

 

Vote no on
Alpha Phi Alpha

The Interfraternity Council faces a decision on Alpha Phi
Alpha next week; its members know that. What they might
not know is that a vote for Alpha Phi Alpha could set race
relations on this campus years behind.

The desire for a new fraternity on the part of the petition-
ers is understandable. Only 21 of W&L’s 996 undergraduate
men are black. In an era when racism is far from absent at
W&L, those 21 men have a lot in common. And their num-
ber is often too small to muster a collective voice in campus
politics.

The fraternity in question is a good choice. Alpha Phi
Alpha is admirable for its achievements in the education of
black youths, high academic standards for its members, and
networking in the professional world. In that regard, it would
offer the fraternity system something it now lacks.

But the most important point in this debate is that Alpha
Phi Alpha will stall this campus’ movement toward bridging
racial gaps.

Alpha Phi Alpha provides only a temporary fix to the
problems of integration by creating a separate but equal
social outlet for black students. In the long-term, the frater-
nity will serve only to draw a clear line between black and
white. As students struggle to overcome racial stereotypes
and integrate socially, Alpha Phi Alpha will stand as an
obstacle, a monument to racism.

The IFC president argues that an IFC ruling against Alpha
Phi Alpha would violate the principle of student autonomy
by going against the wishes of the student petitioners. That
is nonsense. Should IFC hesitate in issuing Rush fines for
fear of violating the autonomy of offenders? IFC is exercis-
ing student autonomy in making a decision. If 612 fraternity
men tum down the petition of 10 students, that is not un-
healthy autonomy.

Many IFC representatives favor Alpha Phi Alpha because
they are in fact indifferent and do not want to go to the
trouble of opposing the new fraternity; that opinion is in fact
an attack on student autonomy. The IFC holds the power of
decision on this matter because the university trusts the
council to know the issue and do what is best. A council-
man’s failure to make an educated vote is a failure to per-
form as an elected fraternity official.

It will not be easy for any chapter to vote against Alpha
Phi Alpha. It seems presumptuous to disappoint the fellow-
student petitioners based on an educated estimation of future
events. But the right course of action is frequently the most
difficult.

W&L fraternities and students on the. whole are gradually
taking to integration. It is the nature of evolution, even
social evolution, that the process is slow. We must all be
patient lest today’s quick remedy become tomorrow’s poison.

Magic’s lesson
is for us, too

Magic Johnson’s announcement that he is infected with
the AIDS virus saddened many of us. It was painful to see
him issued the death sentence that is an HIV-positive test
result.

Unfortunately, many of us at W&L seem to have missed
the point of Magic’s announcement. He contracted the AIDS
virus doing something almost all of us have done before: he
had intercourse with a member of the opposite sex and did
not wear a condom. We kind of doubt many people on
campus have changed their habits as a result.

Surely, if a W&L student became infected with the AIDS
virus, people here would begin to think about protecting
themselves. Let’s just hope it doesn’t have to come to that.

Quote of the Week

They're into a lot of service and high academic standards,
not what we’ re used to.

black fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha

Law students
demand changes

To Dean Randall P. Bezanson:

Given the recent racially intolerant incidents
centered at the School of Law, measures, both
reactive and proactive, must be addressed.

In the August 1991 letter Executive Commit-
tee President Giles Perkins distributed to the
(Law) Class of 1994, he says, ‘‘You may live,
study and pursue your goals in an atmosphere of
unparalleled freedom that is available to the
Washington and Lee community only because of
the Honor System.’’ He goes on to say, “‘...the
students are those who exemplify the highest
standards of personal integrity.”’

After eight weeks here, even the First Year
Law students know this is definitely not the
reality. What Washington and Lee offered was
the (seemingly) ideal microcosm where students
could leave their personal property at their
carrels without the fear of it being pilfered or
destroyed. No longer will we, as students, be a
victim to this myth. Last month, an African-
American student found on his/her carrel, a
message. The message was written on a picture

representing Black art which was of both sen-’

timental and real value. The item of personal
property was defaced and devalued. Moreover,
the message it gave was one full of hate and
bigotry: ‘‘NIGGER’S (sic) MUST DIE.”

This is a clear message to law and under-
graduate students of African/African-American
decent. It should also impact upon other minority
students at this institution that prides itself on ‘‘a
community of honor.’’ Such a blatantly racist
statement not only shot terror in the heart of the
recipient, it struck a chord in all of us. One who
is not a member of a minority group can only
begin to understand exactly how deeply occur-
rences such as this hurt. It is enough to know
that in this world, there will be people who
despise you simply because of the color of your
skin. When in an undergraduate academic setting,
this remains the prevailing reality. By the time
we reached the professional academic environ-
ment, perhaps we let our guard down. Really
now, how could we think that in a rigorous,
nationally-heralded law school, the racial climate
would be any different? We realize that it takes
just a few to spoil it for all. But hopefully, one
day, the entire student body, faculty and staff
will feel the harm members of minority groups
feel when such senseless and immoral acts occur.

In a February 28, 1991 letter from you, you
write, ‘‘Washington and Lee is a school that
takes seriously its obligation to your educational
training.’’ We hope to broaden that interpretation
of the word ‘‘educational.’’ Because the School
of Law is unique in its scope, it has the poten-
tial to affect positive change. Unfortunately, in
this incident of late, the appropriate authorities
may not find the perpetrator of the offensive act.
But, this does not mean that some beneficial
outcome cannot result.

Now is the time! The university can seize
this moment to educate and further enlighten the
entire community. It will take a great deal of
one-on-one interaction at the small-scale level,
but the long-range outcome is guaranteed to be
well worth the effort. The School of Law needs
to let the students know, definitively, that such
acts are not honorable and not in keeping with
the guidelines as provided by the university
student body in the Honor System pamphlets.
This is an opportunity to prove to the student
body that ‘*...mutual trust and respect form the
bedrock of relationships within the community.”’
The university has already mandated that this
ugly circumstance be dealt with effectively and
with forthrightness, ‘‘No violation of this trust is
too small to be ignored, for we understand that
honor is not measured by degree.”’

To assist the university in taking the steps
necessary to develop a truly honorable com-
munity, a community in which students of
diverse backgrounds (along with majority stu-
dents) can feel comfortable and flourish both
personally and professionally, we offer these
options:

1. Promote the recruitment and retention of
racial minorities as students.

2. Creatively and earnestly retain racial
minorities as teacher and scholars. These first
two points serve as examples/role models to both
majority and minority students. Their contribu-
tions would afford the entire university com-
munity the ability to be more open and respect-
ful of those different from oneself. Of the high-
est priority is to keep the single African-Amer-

 

LETTERS

ican male professor at W&L and attract at least
one African-American female professor, in the
hope that she would eam tenure here.

3. Celebrate the national holiday of the great
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday.
Forty-eight other states have adopted the long-
awaited holiday, as well as the majority of top
institutions. Should not W&L set an example to
its students by conceding that this individual
played a monumental role in the advancement of
race relations?

4. Hold mandatory seminars on multi-cul-
turalism, especially for the undergraduate com-
munity’s awareness. Given that Washington and
Lee has grown from the date of its founding, it
is necessary to ensure that the student body
grows culturally along with it. Educate and
expose the community to ideas, cultures, eth-
nicities and lifestyles that may be different from
their own. It is an obligation for teachers and the
administration to provide the students with the
useful skills that will provide them with the
means to function positively and effectively in
this cultural mosaic we call our world.

5. Allow the Black Law Student Association
to contribute to pre-orientation for minority

‘students. Not only is it beneficial.to hear from-

faculty and staff ofthe university, it would
provide an even deeper view of student life if
the minority faculty/staff and BLSA introduced
themselves or even conducted a portion of the
orientation.

6. Support the claims of honesty and civility
regarding the academic environment by harshly
quashing infractions thereof (expulsion). As it
stands, a letter to each law student’s carrel is
simply not enough. Because the carrel mail
system is flooded with many handbills and
flyers, utilizing this medium does not effectively
reach the student body. Our hope is that your
letter was merely a preliminary measure that will
be followed by a more assertive stance.

7. Encourage a remedy though there is not
always a perpetrator. In the recent case, the

offender has not been identified. This should not
mean that the Executive Committee’s ‘‘hands are
tied’’ nor the Confidential Review Committee’s,
There are ways to deter acts of racial hatred
other than punishing the offender. Promote
awareness at the classroom level with the careful
selection of topics ranging from history to
biology. Require that resident assistants devise
programs to encourage interaction between their
residents, whoever they may be. Other univer-
sities have an established multicultural cur-
riculum that is required not only for incoming
students, but also for students before they grad-
uate. This applies to the undergraduate campus
in particular. There are many schools around the
country after which Washington and Lee can
model their program: University of North Car-
olina at Chapel Hill, Brown University, etc...

With the vast resources we know are avail-
able outside of Washington and Lee, as well as
the resources listed in many of the recruitment
catalogs/brochures, we feel that all such options
can be adopted within a reasonably short amount
of time (one calendar year).

We hope that you will take these ideas
seriously and would like to thank you in ad-
vance for your time that will be spent on making
these above suggestions a reality.

Spectator editor
points out error

The following is an excerpt from a letter ad-
dressed to Charles S. Rowe of The (Frederic-
ksburg) Free-Lance Star. The author writes to
Rowe after a recent meeting offering updated
information. The letter concerns a change in the
1991-92 Catalogue.
November 12, 1991
Dear Mr. Rowe:
..Of far greater consequence than whether or
not any legal proceedings occurred whatsoever,

   

 

surrounds the latter half of the Spectator article
concerned with the suspension. In the 1991-92
Catalogue, the President’s power of suspension
has been radically redefined. It now reads,
“‘Students may be required to sever their connec-
tion with the university for a specified period of
time for non-academic reasons by the President
or by other disciplinary action as outlined in the
Student Handbook.’’ | read this as stating that
the President may suspend at will, and my
discussions with both the President and Dean
Elrod have served to confirm that analysis as
being absolutely correct and valid.

In my discussion with both the President and
Dean Elrod, they informed me that they were
totally unaware of the catalogue change until I
had brought it to their attention. Unquestionably,

they appeared embarrassed by what they describ:
ed as ‘‘an unauthorized change’ and told me
that the existing policy followed the previous
catalogue. Finally, they both said that some form
of public correction would be issued in the Phi.
I want very much to believe and accept both
their promise and the sincerity of their embar-
rassment. Ten days have passed since I first
brought this to the administration’s attention. But
no letter has appeared in the Phi. No public —
correction has been offered. In fact, to the best

-of my knowledge, nothing other than a denial of

the court settlement has been made to the facul-

Nearly twice the time has elapsed that Presi-
dent Wilson required ‘‘to lose faith in student
government’’ before suspending three students
last year and still there has been no action; no
acknowledgement of the error in the catalogue.

I want very much to believe and accept both
their promise and the sincerity of their embar-
rassment, but I find that I can no longer do so.

Whether or not the catalogue change was a
mistake, whether or not President Wilson was
aware of the change, and whether or not he
authorized it is absolutely immaterial. It is on
the books. If the administration wishes to change
that fact, they must issue a public correction. Of
course, I am no lawyer. But common sense
would dictate that they should issue a statement
to every student and each of their parents.
Furthermore, someone needs to justify to the
Board of Trustees exactly how such a radical
change could be implemented without administra-
tion or Trustee knowledge, much less approval.
Finally, the current procedures by which the
catalogue is written and edited needs to be
changed, perhaps under Trustee auspices, to
insure that an unauthorized change of such
monumental proportions never occurs again.

The President’s and the university’s reputa-
tions are at stake...

Bikers banned
on Chessie Trail

To the Editor:

Since the opening of the Chessie Nature Trail
in 1981, the usage regulations have prohibited
vehicular traffic along the route and signs at
each entrance to the trail have made that policy
clear.

Recently, many bikers have begun using the
Trail. The VMI Foundation, Inc., which owns
and manages the facility, has received a number
of complaints from pedestrian patrons. As a
result, we must more stringently enforce the
‘pedestrians only’’ regulation. We are contacting
a number of groups who regularly use the
Chessie Trail to ask for their cooperation on this
matter.

Bicycles may be legally and appropriately
ridden along many public roads. The Chessie
Nature Trail provides a rare special environment
for pedestrians — hikers, runners, bird-watchers,
fishermen, etc. It is our responsibility to keep it
safe and pleasant for them.

Thank you for your assistance and coopera-
tion.

Sincerely,
Louise K. Dooley
Chessie Nature Trail Committee Chair

EC dips into
reserve funds

Pub Board takes no action
on student magazine proposal

 

By Greg Patterson
Staff Reporter

 

The Executive Committee had to tap into an emer-
gency reserve fund Monday night in order to grant $1,700

to the men’s volleyball club.

The volleyball allocation used up the $1,202 left in
the EC working reserve and the $374 in the student body
working reserve, EC Vice President Bo Russell.

Russell said the EC will draw money from a student

body ‘‘historical reserve’’ to make up the difference.

The historical reserve is an interest-bearing account
which is made up of funds from the student activities fee
which are not used by the EC, Russell said.

He said the account was created ‘‘for years like this

when money is tight, and the EC has used most of it.’’
Russell said he will probably transfer around $4,000
from the emergency reserve for use by the EC ‘‘in case

any more clubs come in.”’

The volleyball team requested $2,890 in funding. EC
President Giles Perkins said because the team came in
late in the funding year and because the EC funds were
so low, he thought the team should only get $1,500.

However, the committee voted 7-4 to give the team

$1,700.

In other news, the Publications Board could not
choose a format for the proposed new campus magazine
Monday night because it did not have a quorum.

Representatives of The Ring-tum Phi and Political
Review attended the meeting, but Calyx, Ariel, and Jour-
nal of Science representatives were present.

Calyx, Ariel, and Journal of Science voted last week
to create the new magazine, while the Phi voted against
the motion. Political Review was absent last week.

The next meeting is scheduled for Monday, Nov. 18
at 8 p.m. in the Phi office. All students with proposals

are invited.

Men in Confederate uniforms and women in
hoop skirts packed Lexington’s City Council
chambers Thursday night to protest the absence
of Confederate flags at a ceremony honoring
Stonewall Jackson this past summer.

Rudy York, who spoke for the Sons of
Confederate Veterans, told the council that his
group was not allowed to carry Confederate

IFC to vote on fraternity

and Lee.

He said if IFC votes to allow
Alpha Phi Alpha, ‘‘philosophically,
we... [would be] going against the
greater view that we want an in-
tegrated campus.

“But this school is big on student
autonomy,’’ Hicks said. ‘‘to get [A-
Ipha Phi Alpha] turned down goes
against a lot of what this school
stands for.’’

IFC has the final word on wheth-
er the historically black fraternity re-
establishes a chapter at W&L. Three-
fourths of IFC must vote for re-es-
tablishment for it to pass.

 

Chi Psi President Trevor Hil-
debrand said he supports Alpha Phi
Alpha coming to W&L even though
some of the men soliciting the black
fraternity were Chi Psi members.

““We’ve had three black guys
deactivate,’ Hildebrand said, ‘‘but I
think these guys should be able to
get the most of their college ex-
perience.”’

Only one representative at the
meeting challenged approval of Alpha
Phi Alpha, and he would not give his
name.

“It won’t keep integration in
houses,’’ he said.

Chi Psi Brandon Neblett said he
expects approval for Alpha Phi Al-
pha.

“Everybody seems to be in favor
of it,’’ Neblett said.

Cameron Humpries, ’93, Dallas,

Texas — ‘‘Why not. It will be
nice not being the new kid on the
block any longer. And it’s cer-
tainly fun watching the Phi sweat
out the threat of new competi
tion,’’

 

 

 

Emily Greer, ’92, Marion, Va.
- ‘I don’t have time to read
another magazine unless it’s going
to present some new ideas.’’

‘‘There are some segments of our com-

munity that might not have felt comfortable

attending a ceremony where a symbol that has
suffered the abuse of misinterpretation was dis-
played,’’ Shaw said.

York said the misinterpretation of the
Confederate flag should not have stopped the
planners from displaying the flag.

‘*Because a large proportion of the popula-
tion cannot distinguish between history and
hate, we have been wronged,’ he said.

York asked Lexington Mayor H.E. Derrick
to send letters of apology to leaders of the Sons
of Confederate Veterans and the Jackson family.
Derrick said he did not think he owed any
apologies.

understand that the original chapter
was not a member of the IFC. This
is unacceptable.”’

Support for approving the frater-
nity was strong, but not unanimous.
Howison refused to release the actual
vote of the SAC members.

‘Everyone kept an open mind
throughout this. process,’’ Howison
said. ‘‘Many of us shifted opinions.’’

While the social goals of the
fraternity, as a bridge between W&L
and Lexington’s minorities, are ad-
mirable, Howison said the SAC de-
bated the chapter’s viability without
more students involved.

The possibility of failure con-
cerned SAC member Cinda Rankin.

“T realize that they need diversity
as much as the white students do,’’
Rankin said. ‘‘They need the avail-
ability of varying choices. Our system
as it stands now doesn’t give them
many options.’’

The committee also examined the
pressures that would be put on in-
coming black students, possibly de-
tracting from the fraternity system.

But Howison noted that Alpha Phi
Alpha’s policy of holding winter rush
would give interested freshmen a
chance to go through fall rush first,
exposing them to the standard frater-
nity system.

Senior John Harris, a spokesman
for the W&L students who petitioned

 

   

 

 

Howison

Alpha: Phi Alpha, found the vote
encouraging.

‘I’m very pleased that the SAC
approved it,’’ Harris said. ‘‘I’ve been
working on this for a year and a half
and I’m overwhelmed. I just hope the
IFC makes the same decision."’

Yet Harris realizes the battle will
not be easy.

“I think the IFC’s biggest ques-
tion is how Alpha Phi Alpha will fit
into the rush program here on cam-
pus,’’ Harris said.

Howison said the opinions of the
fraternity presidents were mixed. The
presidents favored giving an oppor-
tunity to those minority students not
interested in the existing fraternities
but thought inviting Alpha Phi Alpha
might encourage a segregated system.

Howison said he expects a de-
cision from the IFC before Thanks-
giving break.

“It was a heated and interesting
discussion, but now it’s out of my
hands,’’ Howison said.

possibly cover everything and it’s
not really a forum for political
debate.”’

Several Washington and Lee students say they think their participation as
student coaches in local recreation programs for children have improved the
college’s standing in the Lexington community.

The Rockbridge Area Recreational Organization brings the students
together with local children between ages eight and 13 to form, football, soc-
cer, basketball and lacrosse teams. According to RARO Program Coordinator
Chad Joyce, the student coaching has met with great success.

‘The kids intermingle really well with the students,’’ Joyce said, ‘‘kids
kind of look up to them.”

The student coaches say they enjoy the kids as well.'

‘Coaching is fun and the kids are cool,’’ said W&L junior Hobson Barnes,
who coached soccer.

When the program began three years ago however, many area parents were
so outraged at the idea that they took their children to other youth leagues,
according to Joyce.

“‘T think there was a lot of resentment when we first started letting stu-
dents coach,’’ Joyce said.

Parents gradually got used to seeing college kids coach their children,
Joyce said, and that now some parents even appreciate the advantages of
student coaching.

W&L seniors Will Jones and Spencer Patton, who have coached RARO
football for three years, agreed that the program’s popularity has increased.

‘It has become a lot more competitive since my sophomore year. This

| W&LIFE
Students and kids make RARO \ work

was the best team I've had,’’ Patton said.
‘The parents get a better view of W&L students,’ Jones added.
All the coaches urged other students to get involved.
“I think [RARO’s] a good thing,’’ Swift said.
“It’s really good for a positive relationship between the school and com-

munity,’’ he said.

Joyce said he thinks the kids react better with the students because they
are younger and can still remember when they were kids.

“It’s not another kid’s parent they have to listen to,’’

The absence of parental authority, however, can cause disciplinary pro-
blems, according to W&L junior Whit Swift, who coached soccer.

“*You have trouble with a few kids [who] don’t respond to you as well
Swift said.

Junior Key Foster, who coached 13- and 14-year-olds, said that his soccer
team had a few disciplinary problems also.

“*At that age they’re a little rebelious and a little hard to handle,’’ Foster

as they would to an adult,"

said.

“But generally they were really good,’’ he added.

W&L junior Walter Todd coached a football team that won only one
game, and he stressed that winning is not the focus of RARO.

‘You're just trying to instill in the kids good sportsmanship,”’

Swift agreed, saying the hardest part of coaching is balancing the kids’
desire to play with the coaches’ desire to win.

“It was hard keeping everyone happy as far as playing time is con-

cemed,”’ Swift said.

He added ‘‘You really want to win, but you also want to make sure

everyone had a good time.’’

Several Washington and Lee
groups have planned projects to
aid local help agencies during
Thanksgiving.

The Washington and Lee Inter-
fraternity Council will conduct a
canned food drive to help the
Community Outreach Program of
Lexington, which encourages
neighborhood involvement in help
programs.

As part of the drive, various
W&L fraternities and _ sororities
will put grocery bags donated by
Harris Teeter on __ residents’
doorsteps.

A week later, more nonperish-
able foods will be collected and
distributed to families in need.

Similarly, Chi Omega sorority
will conduct a canned food drive
to supplement donations collected

by the R.E. Lee Episcopal Church.

‘*A lot of area citizens have
been hit hard by the recession,”’
said member Amy Beall, ‘‘so the
community will be appreciative.’’

Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity
members will collect food and
money for Habitat for Humanity
next week.

Other organizations sponsoring
food drives are Alpha Phi Omega
Service fraternity and Campus
Crusade for Christ. The contribu-
tions will go to needy Lexington
residents, as well as the Buena
Vista Food Bank.

‘*The students do what they
can to help, and we've had
tremendous response from _ the
community in the past, huge boxes
were filled at places like Kroger,”’
said an organizer of one of last
year’s drives.

Delta Tau Delta fraternity will
sponsor a skeet shoot for the
United Way. Teams of three may

 

 

Holidays are a time for help

participate for $30 on Saturday,
November 16 from 1 to 6 p.m.

Winners will receive dinner for

“You bring the shotgun, and
we’ll provide the shells,’’ said Delt
member Rob Wilson.

Kappa Alpha Theta sorority
will hold its annual Gong Show, a
singing/lin-synching competition
Wednesday night in the Pit.
Proceeds from the show will be
split among several charities.

Theta) members have also
begun working on Christmas dona-
tions for needy area children.

According to Theta Service
Chair Morgan Warner, the group
has obtained names of over 100
children its members will
anonymously donate gifts to.

Gladys House Director of
Volunteers Mac Crawford said
many local organizations like the
homeless shelter will need extra
help during the holidays season.

Cadets fight blazes for fun

 

By Babli Sinha
Staff Reporter

 

About sixty of Virginia Military Institute’s students
have been in the hot seat all year. The members of the
college’s volunteer Fire Squad have been called to
fight three nearby forest fires since August.

Most recently the cadets battled last month’s 1500-

acre Piney Mountain Fire near Buena Vista. Squad
members were called to fight the five- acre Mas-
sanutten Fires in Rapahannock Co., Virginia. They also
fought a twenty-five acre fire in Bridgewater, Virginia.

The group was trained by the United States
Forestry Department and the Virginia Forest Service.
The Forestry Department calls members to help area
fire departments fight blazes, and assigns them the part
of the fires they work on.

Senior fire squad member Alex Jackson described
the squad as ‘‘laborers.’” The group’s main respon-
sibility is to build firelines to stop the spread of the
ground fires, which burn through the root systems and
take longer to put out completely. This involves encir-
cling the fire with water hoses and five-gallon sacks of
water, called ‘‘Bladder Bags.”’

According to Senior Chris Bergstol, who heads the
fire squad, squad members are issued fireproof
clothing, helmets, and combat boots,.as; .wells-as

equipment like fire rakes and axes to combat the fires,
by the Forestry Department.

Senior fire squad member Clint Seybold said the
most tedious job come after the fire, when the cadets
perform ‘‘cleanup,’’ which involves searching out
patches of stray flames and putting them out.

The squad breaks into crews of twenty, which work
in twelve-hour shifts. They are escorted only by a
Forest Service worker who knows the terrain.

Sometimes the cadets may fight fires for days at a
time without sleep. When they must camp out at a site
or stay overnight to fight a fire, The Forestry Depart-
ment pays for all costs. Squad members are still ex-
pected to attend classes upon their arrival back at VMI.

The cadets must also be ready to leave VMI in a
hurry if they are called to a fire. Bergstol said he is
notified of the fire by the Forestry Department through
the college. He informs all of the other members of the
assignment.

Although fighting fires can be very dangerous, there
have been no major injuries among squad members in
the past years.

The cadets said fighting fires is grueling work.
They say they often work in the bitter cold and walk
for miles with burdensome equipment on their backs.
According to one, most get "excited about going’’.

Some, like Clint Seybold, plan to go in to the
forest. service. after waduaiion, 2

Late prof’s poetry published in book

 

By Jameson Leonardi
Staff Reporter

A book of poetry by Clark Mol-
lenhoff, the late Pulitzer-prize winn-
ing journalist and Washington and
Lee professor, has recently been
published.

Mollenhoff, who wrote 11 other
books, was famous for his inves-
tigations into government fraud and
corruption. He was a professor at
W&L from 1978 until his death last
March.

Ballad to an lowa Farmer and
Other Reflections, Mollenhoff’s only
book of poetry, contains almost fifty
poems expressing his feelings on
common subjects like childhood,
being a young man away from home
in the army, and being a good parent.

Several of Mollenhoff’s poems
found fame during his lifetime. The
poem ‘‘Teacher,’’ first published in
the Des Moines Sunday Register in
1957, gained national attention in
1982 when then-President Ronald
Reagan used it in a speech on educa-
tion.

Another poem, ‘‘Music Man,’’ was
used in Meredith Willson’s musical
of the same name. The poem focuses
on Mollenhoff’s brother, a high
school band director.

People might wonder why Mollen-
hoff, a journalist famous for objec-
tively pursuing the truth, would write
poetry. Hampden Smith, head of the
W&L journalism department, bel-
ieves that Mollenhoff wrote poetry in
order to keep his emotions out of his
reporting.

“‘Clark was big, blustery, and

worldly,’’ Smith said. ‘‘He was
driven by a great sense of right and
wrong. His humanity shows up in
his poetry.’’
The following is an excerpt from
Ballad to an lowa Farmer and Other
Reflections. Mollenhoff wrote the
poem as a tribute to John Atanasoff
who along with graduate student
Clifford Berry, designed the first
digital computer. Previous to a fed-
eral court decision in 1973 it was
commonly believed that John Mauch-
ly and Presper Eckert were the inven-
tors. They in fact derived their ideas
from Atanasoff.

Ballad To John V. Atanasoff

At lowa State
in thirty-eight
John turned our world around,
With vacuum tubes,
he theorized,
Swift answers could be found

For problems that

had stumped the world
Of science and of math.
John reasoned that

a base of two
Could guide him on his path.

It started with
a long cold drive,
A drink, a quiet thought.
In darkened bar,
John found the theme
To solve what Babbage sought.

At lowa-State

in thirty-nine
His theories met the test
Of prototype,

then desk-sized frame-
A stimulating quest.

With Berry's help,
John built the rig
To test his theories out.

Then as a team
they built the frame
To banish any doubt.

The job was done
when Mauchly came
To view the new machine.
Naive and proud,
they told him all.
John saw no need to screen.

What Mauchly saw-

what Mauchly read.
This scholar was no knave.
This man of letters

would not steal
Or soil the trust they gave.

Then John and Cliff
turned to the work

Of science in the war-

No draft deferments
to pursue

What could have mattered more.

John left the fate
of patent work

In hands he thought were sure
To follow through

in steady ways.
His right would then endure.

But Mauchly broke
his trust with John
And built the ENIAC.
The plans derived
from Cliff and John
Were clothed in secrets black.

And Mauchly took
the bows for years
For concepts that he stole.
He dodged and weaved
and outright lied
To hide John's rightful role.

For thirty years,
he pushed his lies
For profit and for power,
In deposition,
under oath,
Old Mauchly’s "truths" turned sour.

In trials in court,

the truth prevailed.
Judge Larson said it all:

Entitled to stand tall-

Mogk’s running spurs offensive surge

 

From page 8

 

‘‘We put our three receivers on
one side and brought Wilson under-
neath the coverage,’’ Fallon said.
‘Geren put the ball in the perfect
spot for the way Wilson had beaten
the defender.”’

Moore was able to make an over-
the-shoulder catch for his second
touchdown on the season.

After Moore’s score brought the
Generals to within 25-7, both defen-
ses took over, shutting the other team
down, and Guilford left Lexington
with the 25-7 win and a share of the
ODAC tile.

On the day, Mogk led the offense
with 89 yards rushing on just 12

carries, by far W&L’s best rushing
day of the season.

‘*Mogk has shown a lot of prom-
ise as a ball carrier,’’ said Fallon.

Mogk’s effort keyed W&L’s sea-
son-high 229 yards of total offense.

Despite the loss, Fallon takes
pride in the fact that his team hasn’t
been blown out.

‘‘No one has really blown us off
the field and embarrassed us,’’ he
said. ‘‘] look around and their are
other winless teams losing 55-0.
We're still fighting and playing
tough.

“Our kids are concerned about
play, of course, but not down,’’ Fal-
lon said. ‘‘I have to admire these
kids because they’re still working
hard.’’

The Generals get one more chance
to win a game this season Saturday
at Georgetown. The Hoyas’ feature
the best passing attack in Division
III, averaging 307 yards a game.

“Georgetown will be a chal-
lenge,’ Fallon said. ‘‘It’s been no
fluke because they’ve played some
good teams. If you compare scores,
then we shouldn’t even show up.”’

The Generals, though, are not in-
timidated by the Hoyas.

‘We're going up to get our first
win,’’ said Fallon. ‘‘Win, lose, or
draw, Georgetown will know they’ve
been in a game.”’

The Generals, who have been
allowing 131 yards passing, received
a defensive boost when senior Fred
Renneker moved back to defense

against Guilford.

‘‘We knew we had Guilford and
Georgetown coming up on the sched-
ule,’’ said Fallon. ‘‘Also, Geren has
had some success running our regular
I-formation offense. So we put Fred
back on defense, and that’s where
he’s practiced the last two weeks.”’

Renneker played defense for the
first time in 15 games and registered
four tackles and blocked two extra
points in limited action. Renneker
started at quarterback for the first
eight games of the season.

The Generals have not had a
winless season since 1957. W&L last
went into the last game of the season
winless in 1975. The Generals beat
Georgetown 28-26 to get their only
win of the year.

Lynchburg tops
W&L for title

Polo pulls off Eastern upset

 

By Andrew Fox
Staff Reporter

 

Lynchburg College nipped Wash-
ington and Lee’s men’s cross country
team 28-36 in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference championship
meet held Saturday at Hampden-Syd-
ney College.

The Generals gave a solid team
performance, but it was not enough
to overtake LC.

“When you place five runners in
the top ten, you usually win,’ said
coach John Tucker. ‘‘But Lynchburg
ran a great race.”’

Lynchburg, paced by all-American
Greg Cavaliere, captured four of the
top five places. However, the race
was far from over after these four
finished.

The Hornets’ fifth runner lagged
far behind the Generals top five, all
of whom finished under 27:45.

‘‘This was the best race overall
for our top five since I have been
here,’’ Tucker said.

Yet, the strong effort fell just
short as the LC fifth runner finished
sixteenth, which was just good
enough to secure the victory.

Bo Hannah ran a personal best
time of 26:06, only eleven seconds
behind Cavaliere, to finish third over-
all and lead the Generals. Charles
Edwards also ran well as he finished
sixth overall and second for the team
with a time of 27:16.

Hannah and Edwards both earned
all-ODAC honors for their efforts.
The duo will look to extend their
excellent seasons by placing well in
next Saturday’s regional championship
meet.

‘“‘Bo and Charles are both strong
contenders to qualify for nationals,”’
Tucker said.

Also making a strong contribution
was Dave Martin, a heralded track
athlete, who volunteered to run for
the team and finished eighth overall
and third for the team in his only
meet of the year. Personal bests were
turned in by Lee Parker and Keith
Rinn, who finished fourth and fifth,
respectively, for the Generals.

W&L, ranked fifth in the region,
now head into the Southeastern cham-
pionships at Christopher Newport
College in Newport News, Va. The
Generals will look to even the season
series with the Hornets at two wins
each,

The experts predicted that the
Washington and Lee water polo team
would not win a game at the Eastem
Conference Championships.

Those predictions appeared ac-
curate at first when the Generals
dropped the opening match of the
tournament to top-ranked Slippery
Rock by a score of 13-3. However,
W&L rebounded in their second
match to stun 16th-ranked University
of Massachusetts 14-13 in triple over-
time.

After suffering a lackluster offen-
sive performance against Slippery
Rock, the Generals responded with a
courageous effort from senior All-
American Will Davis and sophomore
Greg Golub. Davis stymied the
UMASS defense with five goals to

keep the Generals close and Golub
added two goals, including the game
winner.

“Though we were clearly the
underdogs of the tournament, we
proved the critics wrong with our un-
intimidated and aggressive play,’’ said
Davis.

The Generals aggressive play car-
ried over to their third match against
20th-ranked Bucknell University.
Despite losing 9-6 in double over-
time, the team proved that their win
over UMASS was no fluke. Goalie
P.J. Waicus was impressive in the net
with 10 blocks, but the offense ran
out of gas in the second overtime,
dooming the Generals’ chances for
another upset victory.

Despite the heartbreaking loss to
Bucknell, W&L head coach Page
Remillard was exuberant with his
player’s performance all season.

‘‘While other teams wanted to

party in September and October, we
wanted to wait until November before
celebrating,’’ he said.

Apparently the success was worth
the wait. The Generals secured key
victories in November over the Univ-
ersity of Richmond and UMASS, the
runner up of the New England Con-
ference.

‘‘This was the best team I’ve had
here at W&L,”’ said Remillard. ‘‘We
had great leadership from the seniors
and great cooperation from the under-
classmen. From the seniors on down
to the freshmen, we showed class all
year.”’

It was this leadership and class
that allowed the Generals to improve
each game at a faster rate than their
opponents. After a few tough losses
early in the season, W&L rallied in
October and November to close with
a 15-11 record.

Juniors Andrew Pearson and Chris
Hagge concluded that ‘‘the team
really improved over the course of
the season, something that our op-
ponents didn’t do.”’

Next year the Generals will miss
the leadership and productivity of
seniors Davis and Alan Herrick. Both
players lead the team in scoring with
59 and 57 goals respectively, and
also were the steal and shooting
percentage leaders. Despite their
absence, Remillard feels that the team
has the depth needed to be successful
again next year.

The play of veterans Golub, Hag-
ge, and Jake Berman will be comple-
mented by the talents of freshmen
Derek Devries, Reuben Munger, and
Tony Diederich. In addition, if goalie
P.J. Waicus can improve on his 198
blocks this season, the Generals will
once again be tough to beat.

Herring, Casteel lead women to third place

 

By Jacob Kimball
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee women’s
cross country team finished the sea-
son on a high note as the Generals
finished third in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference championship
meet and reaped individual post sea-
son honors.

Kim Herring and Nicole Casteel

were both named to the all-ODAC
team, and coach Jim Phemister re-
ceived coach of the year honors in a
repeat performance.

W&L battled Roanoke College for
second place, but wound up a close
third. Eastern Mennonite was first
with a score of 37, Roanoke’s 51
was second, followed by W&L’s 53.

Kim Herring finished off what has
been the best year ever by a fresh-
man runner to finish fourth overall

and first for the team. She posted the
third fastest time ever for a W&L
runner at 19:50. With her personal
record time on the collegiate level,
Herring completed a string of seven
straight first place finishes for the
team out of seven meets on the year.

Also running a personal best was
Nicole Casteel whose time of 20:15
placed her seventh overall. Her time
was the sixth fastest time ever for a
W&L runner.

 

 

Freshman quarterback Geren Steiner surveys the situation in
W&L’s 29-7 loss to Bridgewater two weeks ago. Steiner will start
for the second straight week against Georgetown Saturday In what

should be an aerial battle. Georgetown Is the nation’s best passing
team, and W&L has thrown the ball 144 times in its last three

Along with Herring and Casteel,
the other runners in W&L’s top five
also recorded personal records. Sue
Deutsch finished in 22:07, Brandi
Henderson in 22:20, and Deidre
Denechand in 22:20.

The Generals are a young team,
six of the top seven finishers are
freshmen, that is on the upswing as
the team heads into the Southeast
Regional championships this weekend

GC keeps W&L winless

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

The Guilford Quakers had been
one of the hottest football teams in
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference up until two weeks ago.

That was when Randolph-Macon
toppled the team that beat mighty
Emory and Henry. That loss kept
Guilford from winning the ODAC
title.

So the Quakers came to Lexington
last weekend to take on the Generals
in a rather unhappy state of mind.
Add to that the fact that the Generals
had upset the Quakers from running
through the ODAC undefeated last
year. Guilford was mad, and wanted
especially to get after the Generals.

On Saturday, the Generals were
able to cool Guilford down for a
while, but it was a penalty on a hot-
headed General that aided Guilford’s
cause,

After Guilford received what he
thought was a favorable mark on a
fourth-down play allowing them to
get a first down and maintain a drive,
W&L head coach Gary Fallon pro-
tested too much and was hit with a
15-yard penalty.

“It is the first penalty I’ve had in
14 years,’’ he said. ‘*And that penal-
ty really turned out to hurt us.”’

The penalty put the ball on the
W&L 15-yard line, and two plays
later, Calvin Hunter scored to give
the Quakers the lead.

The Generals got another bad
break when, on their next possession,
a snap went over punter Bob Ehret’s

Conkling pins
way to fourth
place at VMI

From Staff Reports

 

 

The Washington and Lee wrestling

team kicked off the 1991-92 season -

last weekend participating in the VMI
Keydet Invitational last Sunday.

Against a field of largely Division
I opponents, the Generals had one
wrestler place in the tournament.
Junior heavyweight John Conkling
placed fourth.

Conkling also recorded W&L’s
only pin of the tournament, puttir ,
Brallio Lopet of Davidson at the 1:4.
mark of the first period.

Volleyball fights
tough in loss
to Guilford

From Staff Reports

 

 

The Washington and Lee vol- |

leyball finished up its season with a
loss in the quarterfinals of the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference Tour-
nament.

After disposing of Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College in the first
round, the Generals ran into the
regular season ODAC champions in
Guilford College.

As expected, W&L had its hands
full. The Quakers quickly ran off the
first two games before W&L was
able to apply some pressure.

In the third game, the Generals
opened up leads of 2-0, 5-2 and 11
5 before the Quakers called time
and regrouped. After the break, Guili-
ford ran off the last 10 points to win
the game and the match.

The Generals’ season ended with
an 11-21 record. Guilford -vent on to
win the tournament, upping its mark
to 34-4,

W&L got outstanding seasons
from senior Mena McGowin, who
finished her career with over 800
kills, and Leslie Hess, who set a
school record with 52 blocks.

The Generals also found a nucleus
for the coming years in freshmen
Jennifer Garrigus and Michele Ral-
ston. Garrigus led the team in digs,
and Ralston had W&L’s third-highest
assist total of all-time.

head into the end zone, where the
Quakers recovered for their second
touchdown and a 13-0 lead after one
quarter.

Early in the second quarter, the
Quakers added to their lead. Hunter
scored on a 12-yard run to make in
19-0 on Guilford’s first possession
and later in the quarter, Pat Tull.
scored from 14 yards out to close the
scoring in the half at 25-0,

“It could have gotten ugly,’’ Fal-
lon said. ‘‘But our kids shut them
down in the second half and we got
some confidence. We hung in
tough.’’

The Generals shut out the Quakers
in the second half, and the run-and-
shoot offense got untracked after
struggling against Guilford’s blitzing
defense in the first half.

Freshman = quarterback ~— Geren
Steiner led the team on an 88-yard
drive, getting unexpected help from
the running game.

With freshman Matthew Mogk
running for seven and eight yards a
carry, the Generals were able to
loosen the Quakers’ secondary. When
the defense keyed on Mogk, Steiner
was able to find freshman Michael
MacLane open down the field for a
44-yard gain.

Steiner completed the drive with a
perfect 10-yard touchdown pass to
sophomore Wilson Moore.

‘“Wilson’s catch was as pretty a
catch as I've seen all year,”’ said
Fallon.

The catch was a confidence builder
for Moore, who was wide open but
dropped a pass on the previous play.
