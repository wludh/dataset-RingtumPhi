Petition
protests

gallery

By Leigh Allen
Staff Reporter

 

 

Student opposition to the location
of the proposed Reeves Center expan-
sion project is being expressed throu-
gh a petition aimed at preventing
construction of the front campus
building.

Junior Richard Chapman is or-
ganizing the petition drive to oppose
the location of the Watson Gallery.

“I’m not opposed to the Univer-
sity accepting the gift. I’m just
opposed to the location of the build-
ing. I don’t think we need another
building on the front campus,’” Chap-
man said.

The proposed Watson Gallery will
be built directly behind the current
Reeves Center and next to Tucker
Hall. It will house an Oriental arts
and ceramics exhibit donated to the
University by Mrs. William Watson
and her late husband William Watson,
a graduate of the University.

Funding for construction and
maintenance of the gallery will also
be donated by the Mrs. Watson, ac-
cording to University President John
D. Wilson.

Final approval for the gallery has
not been granted by the Board of
Trustees.

Chapman said he plans to submit
his petition to the Board when it
takes up the matter at its Board meet-
ing next Thursday.

‘I just want the Board to be
aware of the fact that there is student
opposition to the location of the
building,’’ Chapman said.

Chapman has been collecting
signatures in front of the Co-op duri-
ng the day and in Evans Dining Hall
in the evenings. Copies of the peti-
tion have ,also been distributed to
fraternity chapters.

According to Chapman, he has
collected between 700 and 800 signa-
tures to oppose the building and has
been pleased with the response.

‘I’m hoping to collect signatures
from at least a majority of the stu-
dents before going to the Board,”’
Chapman said.

A VMI cadet has been charged
with rape and sodomy in connection
with the sexual assault of a W&L
freshman in her Gilliam dorm room
Sunday morning.

Chad E. Hudnall, 18, of Newport
News, Va., is being held in Rock-
bridge Regional Jail in lieu of
$25,000 bond.

Hudnall, a sophomore at Virginia
Military Institute, entered the
woman’s unlocked room about 4 a.m.
and attacked her while she slept,
Lexington Chief of Police Bruce
Beard said.

There are conflicting reports of
how the woman escaped.

Beard said three Washington and

Lee men heard her scream and rushed
into the room. The men called W&L
Security and held Hudnall until they
arrived, Beard said.

Michael Young, W&L director of
security, said the woman awoke,
escaped Hudnall, and ran screaming
into the hall. Some W&L students
detained Hudnall there and called
security, Young said. Security then
called Lexington Police.

The woman said she did not know
Hudnall, according to Beard.

Police in Newport News are in-
vestigating a separate charge of a
sexual nature there involving Hudnall,
Beard said.

In addition, Hudnall was indicted
on one count of burglary and one
count of grand larceny in Newport
News _ Tuesday, said B.B. Under-
wood, deputy clerk of the Newport

News Circuit Court. An additional
burglary charge involving Hudnall is
now before a Newport News grand
jury, Underwood said.

Hudnall’s attorney, Anita Filson,
did not return three phone calls Wed-
nesday.

The Rev. Charles C. Caudill, VMI
chaplain, said he had spoken with
Hudnall, but could not reveal the
nature of their discussion.

This is the fourth reported inci-
dent of sexual assault at W&L since
August. In the first case, W&L senior
Marcus Miller was charged with
breaking into the home of a female
WA&L student’s home and attempting
to rape her after she had passed out.
In a plea bargain agreement, the
defendant pled guilty to trespassing.

Young and Beard said Hudnall
entered the hall through an unlocked
door.

Although W&L Security locks the
doors to every freshman hall every
night at 11 p.m. and checks them
periodically, Young said students
generally unlock them or prop them
open.

“‘The security patrol system is
adequate, and the checks are made

said. ‘‘It’s when the doors are

He stressed that students must

not any safer than other communities
across the country.

Students test alcohol
tolerance at the GHQ

 

By Alisha Johnson
Staff Reporter

 

Sixteen students received free
drinks last night, compliments of
Washington and Lee's Health
Education Committee.

The committee, with the Student
Activities Board and Food Service,
sponsored its annual controlled
drinking experiment in the Generals
Headquarters.

Junior Dionne Blyden,  co-
chairwoman of Alcohol Awareness
Month activities, said the experiments
Wednesday night tested the body’s
alcohol tolerance, comparing three
categories of drinkers.

‘The categories consist of
drinkers who stop eating after 4 p.m.,

those who eat dinner before drinking,
and those who eat dinner and munch
high protein snacks while drinking,”’
Blyden said.

Males and females of various
weights participated in each category
and were encouraged to drink at their
own pace.

Throughout the night Lexington
police officers administered a
breathalizer test every 30 minutes to
participants and other curious
students. That test measured the time
it took for individuals to reach .10

percent blood-alcohol content,
Virginia's legal threshold of
intoxication.

Results showed that small-framed
individuals who had not eaten since 4

p.m. became intoxicated faster than
the other drinkers

Rally, sign-up ope

A women’s fraternity rally and
Rush sign-up will welcome Pi Beta
Phi sorority to Washington and Lee
Friday afternoon.

From 4 p.m. to 5:30 p.m., all
university women, including fresh-
men, upperclass students and present
sorority members, may attend a mixer
in the Baker-Davis-Gilliam quad.

Women may register for Rush and
hear a presentation given by Pi Beta

Phi.

‘*All of the present W&L soror-
ities will be there in support of Pi
{Beta] Phi and rush sign-ups,’’ Pan-
hellenic Council President Dale Wyatt
said.

‘“‘We want to encourage all
women to attend,’’ Wyatt said. ‘‘It is
important that everyone appreciates
and stresses the inclusiveness of our
system.”

Including Pi Beta Phi at W&L
has meant promising that its chapter
size will be comparable to that of the
other sororities in just a few years.

Wyatt said Pi Beta Phi’s pledge
class this year will be significantly
larger than that of the other three
sororities.

She declined to estimate how the
rushees will be divided among the
four groups.

Wyatt indicated that the new
pledge classes for the three es-
tablished sororities will be a lot smal-
ler than the 34-member groups they
received last year.

Wyatt says she hopes the
decreased chance of joining one of
the three existing groups will not

meet with PHC to discuss January

If women are unable to attend the

Campus in crisis

In the past two and a half months there have been three
rapes and one sexual assault reported on or near the
Washington and Lee campus. In a report released Monday,
five sophomores said they were raped during their freshman
year. Since school began, there have been reports of
burglaries in the dorms, beatings in the streets, mayhem at
fraternity parties.

Clearly, this university is in crisis.

Never before have we been assaulted with such shocking
evidence of the violent nature of life at W&L. Our veneer
of gentility and civility has been stripped away and the raw,
cold, heartless underside of our community has been
exposed for the whole world to see.

There are two problems that need attention in these
matters: first, the well-meaning but ineffective leadership of
the administration and the student government, and second,
the tolerance of the student body of clearly inappropriate
behavior.

Will those in leadership roles on this campus simply try
to cover the exposed ugliness and replace W&L’s mask of
perfection, or will they take this opportunity to repair the
decay underneath? Will students recognize the violent nature
of their actions or will they continue blindly, believing that
recent events are an exception and not the rule?

The first step toward healing has already been taken. The
victims who had the courage to report crimes against them
and to press charges against the accused have begun the
process of healing for the university. It is unfortunate, but
true, that they will be blamed by many people for being
trouble-makers. Rather, they are the heroes who have opened
up the wound so it can be cleaned.

In the coming weeks, we will offer suggestions to both
students and university leaders as we all, together, begin the
process of rebuilding what at one time must have been a
true code of gentlemanly behavior.

Still unaware

In this designated week and month of alcohol awareness,
it is clear that most of the effort expended on the program
is going to waste. The university’s approach to the subject

is so mundane that students are tuning out the message.

There are three basic flaws in the current approach to
alcohol awareness programming: public relations, overkill,
and outlook. These, flaws explain the. ‘programa’ s, limited
success. «4 3) oats

Most students: who went to hone! ‘guest inaiieer aad
recovering alcoholic Mike Green found his presentation both
entertaining and constructive. But not many students went,
mostly because the poster advertising the event was boring
with only a picture of Green’s face, his name, the topic of
the talk, and when and where. That is an example of bad
public relations.

Simply that the talk had to do with alcohol awareness
might have been enough to turn students away. The univer-
sity’s blitzkrieg approach to alcohol awareness generally
leaves students more sick of the topic than they get from
drinking too much. Alcohol awareness meets you at every
turn. That is overkill.

Among the leaflets available in the University Center is
a survey that asks the reader to answer 20 questions,
including, number one, ‘‘Do you lose time from classes due
to drinking?’’ Most of the questions ask for no account of
frequency or habit. If you answer yes to only three ques-
tions, the survey says you are problem drinker. That is
simply not definitively true by any realistic standard.

The goals of the Alcohol Awareness Program are noble
and justified, but there is tremendous room for improvement.
First, improve public relations, being aware of the audience
and competing interests. Second, overcome overkill; rather
than one week of overkill and 29 weeks of ignorance, the
program’s resources would best be spread over the year.
Third, have a realistic outlook; don’t promote resources that
insult a student’s ability to drink responsibly.

Judge Thomas: examining the jury

 

MY VIEW
By Richard E. Hill, Jr.

 

A few observations regarding the confirmation

hearings of Clarence Thomas:
The Winners

Clarence Thomas — By the time that this goes
to press, hopefully he will have already been
confirmed. If not, it is my feeling that the hearts
of the American people go out to him and his
family. He has experienced not the American
dream, but an American nightmare. He has been
dragged through the mud by the liberal
establishment and by the media and I am ashamed
as a fellow citizen of this nation that he has had to
endure such a thing.

Arlen Specter and Dennis DeConcini — Both
voted against Bork and both support Thomas.
Specter’s performance last weekend did justice to
his reputation as a vigorous and_ successful
prosecutor. DeConcini has earned my respect by
standing by Thomas, despite the fact that his
Democratic colleagues on the committee seem to
want to stop at nothing to derail his nomination.

Orrin Hatch — As usual, the senior Senator
from Utah has demonstrated his capacity as a
brilliant legal mind and as a pillar of honesty and
fairness. But, he can be a firebrand when he wants

to, and there were times, during. these , hearings _
when he showed. this. country what he is made of..

there will

Hopefully, be a Supreme Court

nomination in his future.:Let’s see! the liberals try |

Miller responds
to Phi article

To the Editor:

After reading last week’s headline story, I
was appalled and thoroughly disgusted in the
way that I was treated in that article. I was
shocked to discover that quite a few details of
the article were either misleading or not fact-
based. It seems to me that accurate reporting
means covering a story from both sides and not
choosing one. Last week’s article violated these
principles in the fact that only the person
pressing the charges was interviewed. My side of
the story was never told and, as a result, thou-
sands of people now only see me in the eyes of
my accusers. Several of the accusations against
me were biased and false. The term slander
comes to mind at a time like this. I feel my
character and rights as a person have also been
unjustly violated. I would point out that I was
charged with simple trespass, a very minor
offense. I would hope that my fellow students
would realize that if the allegations of my
accusers were true, then neither the judge nor the
prosecuting attorney would have agreed to reduce
the charge. I would also like to thank all those
who have been behind me in all this, and I think
it is now time to let this issue rest.

Sincerely,
Marcus L. Miller

EC President
urges caution

To the Editor:

I write to you in reaction to the troubling
events that have plagued our campus during the
last few weeks. I want to share my perspective
as to what has happened and how we should
react.

Primarily, 1 urge caution. We all enjoy the
benefits and freedoms that stem from living in
an environment of trust. However, this trust has
been violated, and we must now recognize that
all individuals on this campus must protect their
personal safety.

Furthermore, we have a duty to look after
one another. Do not let fellow students endanger
themselves. We also have a duty to send out our
support to those who have already been harmed.
Rape is a crime against our very society, and the
survivors should not be subject to rumors or
ridicule,

Finally, I want to ask you to join together in
dealing with the problems before us. We are
most effective as a community.

Sincerely,
Giles Perkins
Executive Committee President

 

with Robert Gates,
Constitution. The founding fathers would be
appalled if they saw what advice and consent has’

and dig up sleaze on him.

Allen Simpson — He told Nina Totenberg off!
What else needs to be said?

The Jury Is Still Out

Joseph Biden — I saw a rare side of Biden this
weekend, but it wasn’t always consistent. At one
moment he would come across as exceedingly fair
and impress the pants off me; yet, in the next, he
would do something that made him look rather
ridiculous. He did make a statement on polygraphs
that demonstrated to me that he is not simply a
partisan tool. It went something to the effect of
“‘our country has reached a sad state of affairs
when polygraph results become the deciding factor
in a dispute.’’ Hats off to you on that one, Joe!
(He even got commended by Thurmond and Hatch
on that statement.) He could really impress me by
changing his vote and supporting Thomas, but I
don’t think that is likely to happen.

Howell Heflin — He voted against Thomas, but
he has a sharp mind and strikes me as being fair
and honest.

The Losers

The Confirmation Process — When a Senate
confirmation hearing degenerates into an
inquisition, the likes of which this country hasn’t
seen since the days of McCarthy, the voters of this
nation and every member of the U.S. Senate have
some major soul searching to do. What this
country has witnessed, not only with Thomas, but
is a_ disgrace to the

become.

 

LETTERS

 

Cartoon biased,
ignores issue

To the Editor:

I am a resident of Massachusetts and as such
would be the first to admit that Senator Ted
Kennedy often displays a lack of common sense,
to say the least. For this, he deserves all the bad
press and criticism the media can muster. How-
ever, Tim Molloy’s recent cartoon concerning
Senator Kennedy and Ms. Anita Hill showed a
total lack of understanding as to the real issue at
hand. Molloy’s cartoon was totally lacking in
good sense and taste, not to mention fact!

The fact that you, the editors, allowed this
cartoon to be printed shows a lack of good
judgement on your part. I was under the im-
pression that the purpose of The Ring-tum Phi
was to produce as professional a newspaper as
possible. I seriously doubt if any professional
publication would print such a blatantly hostile
piece. Mr. Molloy’s cartoon certainly shows a
predisposed dislike for Senator Kennedy. This is
unfortunate as it serves only to belittle the
serious charges that have been placed before the
Judiciary Committee.

Rather than making baseless charges against
Senator Kennedy and Ms. Hill, would it not
have been more constructive to do an editorial
on sexual harassment, after all, that is the real
issue here. These hearings, whatever their out-
come, have raised very significant questions as
to the occupational ethics of many Americans.
These questions are not going to go away, no
matter how much people like Mr. Molloy ‘‘poke
fun’? at them. To me, Mr. Molloy’s cartoon
shows either a fear of this issue or a total lack
of understanding as to the severity of sexual
harassment. Either way, I would hope that in the
future the editors and staff of The Ring-tum Phi,
would consider more carefully the profes-
sionalism of that which they choose to print.

Sincerely yours,
Patrick McDermott, '94

(Ed. note: This letter and the next were written
before the Senate voted 52-48 Tuesday to confirm
Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.)

Ted Kennedy — i"!
I must laugh! When are the voters from
Massachusetts going to wise up? A man such as
this doesn’t deserve to sit in judgement of Attila
the Hun, let alone Clarence Thomas.

Howard Metzenbaum — I never knew that one
individual could be so cruel, so partisan, and so
downright nauseating. If it is proven that he or his
staff leaked the F.B.I. report to the press, than he
should have an ethics hearing that makes this one
look like a court date for a speeding ticket. I
apologize to Robert E. Lee for mentioning him and
Kennedy on this campus.

Herb Kohl, Patrick Leahy, and Paul Simon -
- Each is useless in their own right. I feel sorry
for the states that they represent.

Anita Hill — I feel sorry for her, because her
life will never be the same. It is difficult to pass
judgement on her. I have a feeling that she is
being used by people who couldn’t give a damn
about her feelings, and she just doesn’t realize it.
It is also conceivable, and, perhaps, even likely
that she honestly believes every word she told that
committee.

The allegations of sexual harassment had to be
addressed, I don’t question that. It is simply the
way that it was handled that infuriates me. To steal
an expression from the movie True Believer, only
three people know the truth of these allegations:
Anita hill, Clarence Thomas, and God. Thomas
and Hill are diametrically opposed on every
account. God isn’t talking. I believe Clarence
Thomas, ‘and I support him. He'll make a fine
addition to the Supreme Court.

 

cial branches. Thomas has stirred up debate
across the United States for two fundamental
reasons. First, he opposes abortion, and secondly,
he opposes affirmative action. For thes two
reasons, many special interest groups have fran-
tically sought for any way to block his entry
onto the Supreme Court. Their last, and final,
assault came with the claim that he sexually
harassed Anita Hill.

At a fundamental level, those in Congress
who oppose Thomas have done so all along on
political grounds, and not for reasons of his lack
of capability or integrity. If Thomas loses the
battle, this will prove that Congress now has
supreme power over the Judicial branch of
government, and that Congress will only confirm
those who pay homage to special groups, and to
liberal congressmen and congresswomen. Gone
are the days when a judge can think for himself
or herself.

A simple message for judges aspiring to
serve on the Supreme Court: Do not make
decisions based on what you really believe, but
on what will gain you the least harassment from
Congress.

Frank Martien, '92

Next week, the Lexington Planning Commission will debate granting Delta Tau Delta
a conditional use permit for renovations on their fraternity house, shown above. Delt
is the last fraternity house that must appear before the commission.

City to discuss Delt

 

By Joshua Manning
Staff Reporter

 

The Lexington Planning Commission will
hold a public hearing next Thursday to discuss
granting a conditional use permit to the Delta
Tau Delta fraternity house.

Scheduled to undergo the Fraternity Renais-
sance program in January, Delt is the final
fraternity house that needs planning commission
approval.

Lexington Building and Zoning Ad-
ministrator Bill Blatter told the planning com-
mission last Thursday that he sees only benefits
from approving the permit application.

“Delta Tau Delta can continue to exist as it
is if we deny the application, and I see that the
proposed renovations will only make the house
better,’’ Blatter said. ‘‘The question is, how
will the public respond?”’

Delt currently has a non-conforming use
permit which allows the fraternity to remain
indefinitely in violation of Lexington zoning
laws. But, the complete renovation of the

house, called for by the Renaissance plan,
invalidates that permit.

University Coordinator of Capital Planning
Frank Parsons said that parking is bound to be
the most controversial issue before the plann-
ing commission.

Under the Renaissance plans, Delt residents
will park in the Chi Psi parking lot in order to
adhere to Lexington’s one bed, one space rule.
Delt currently has only six parking spaces.

The house’s proposed renovations to the
site include trees and a fence, both intended to
reduce noise coming from the house.

The public hearing, on Oct. 24 at 5 p.m. in
City Hall, will allow the public a chance to
address the planning commission before it
votes. If the planning commission approves the
plan, it must also win approval from the Lexi-
ngton City Council.

Parsons does not see any major roadblocks
in front of the petition.

“I think the Delts are pretty good ne-
ighbors for the people they live around,’
Parsons said. ‘‘There shouldn’t be a problem on
this, but I’ve misplaced my confidence before.’’

CDs missing
from dorm

By Summer Brown
Staff Reporter

 

 

 

Students in Graham-Lees dormitory lock their doors
since more than 70 compact discs were taken from an
unlocked room Oct. 5.

Whitney Bludworth, a freshman, left his room un-
locked and found his compact disc collection missing.

Robert Eison, a friend of Bludworth, returned a
borrowed CD around 11 p.m. and noticed the others
missing. Bludworth returned about 2 a.m. and informed
Washington and Lee Security and the Lexington Police
Department.

Eison said he had seen two unfamiliar men in the hall
three different times that night but didn’t think much of
it.

“I haven’t seen them on campus before. They would
leave every time I walked out into the hall,’’ Eison said.
“‘T wasn’t suspicious until I found out the CDs were
missing.”

The strangers were described as two white males age
18-22. One was 6 feet, 200 pounds with black hair, and
the other was 5 feet 10 inches, 150 pounds with a flat
top, Eison reported.

Mike Young, head of security, urges students to keep
their doors locked and report any suspicious people.

‘Students have got to be more aware of their own
security,’’ Young said.

Students often don’t lock doors because of the Honor
System, Young said, but other people enter W&L build-
ings all the time who have no concern for students’
property or the Honor System.

“The Honor System is wonderful for students who
live on campus, but people who don’t live here don’t
abide by it,’’ Young said.

Alex Cross, a freshman living in Baker Dorm said that
he never locked his door, but he said he will now.

‘Everyone is keeping their doors locked now,’’ Cross
said.

Bludworth said that no one on his hall locked their
doors because there was never any reason to.

‘“‘Now I lock my door every time I come out,’’ he
said.

The missing CDs have the letters ‘‘BLUD”’ written on
them, and some CDs were in a case.

Convention, The Waller Family, a
motown band, will perform at an MC

‘It is important to get everyone

This year marked the fifth year in a row
that a Washington and Lee woman captured
the Homecoming Honors.

On Oct. 12 senior Jodi Herring was
crowned Homecoming Queen. Herring
represented Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, and
was escorted by Joel Shinofield.

Herring is very involved in the W&L
community. She is captain of the cross-
country team, and is co-captain of the swim
team with Doug Brown. Herring is also a
second year dorm counselor. This year she
has the added responsibility of Assistant
Head Dorm Counselor.

It’s essentially ‘‘a 24-hour-a-day job”
said Herring. She also leads responsible
behavior seminars along with the crises that
occur on her 3rd floor Davis dormitory.

Herring said her job as assistant head
dorm counselor entails being a ‘‘link bet-
ween freshmen and the administration.”

When asked about winning the crown
Herring said she was ‘‘very surprised’’ and
was ‘‘really honored just to be nominated.”’

W&LiFE

_|Herring crowned queen |

After her nomination Herring received a
letter from Kathekon notifying her of a
‘*get-to-know-you”’ interview with the judg-
ing committee. Each nominee was inhter-
ge for approximately 5 minutes on Oct.

x

The judges were Charles F. Murray,
former director of Security; Robert J. de
Maria, Professor of Journalism and com-
munications; Barbara J. Brown, Professor
and University Librarian; Micheal A. Pleva,
professor of chemistry; and Christine L.
Davis, Campaign Events Coordinator,
Development.

Friday night each nominee and her escort
gathered at the alumni house for a reception
with alumni. Herring had the opportunity to
speak to many Five Star Generals as well as
hear stories of W&L days gone by.

Herring said she got the chance to tell
men who graduated before co-education
about ‘‘what it’s like to be a woman at
W&L.”’

After Saturday’s game there was another
alumni reception, which Herring attended as
Queen. The event capped off the official
festivities of what Herring called an ‘‘cxc
iting weekend.”’

Hunting season
will begin soon

Sophomore Jim Gilreath of

 

Last Wednesday, Mike Green, a former alcoholic who’s been sober for 14
years, delivered the keynote address in Lee Chapel for Washington and Lee's
annual Alcohol Awareness Week.

Green now tours college campuses lecturing on alcoholism. He urges
students to drink wisely so that they can continue to drink for the rest of their
lives.

Greenville, S.C. gets his shot-
gun ready for the quickly ap-
proaching season. Look for a
special feature on the opening
of fall hunting season in next
week's Phi.

“One of the biggest problems is that we don’t teach drinking,’ said Green.
He went on to list different types of drinkers: developed, controlled con-
sumption, social, negative, non-controlled, and dependent.

Green explained that developed drinkers never drink, and controlled con-
sumption drinkers get drunk only about five times a year. Green said that
social drinkers get drunk 6-25 times a year.

Green said that negative drinkers get drunk 26-100 times a year, and non-
controlled drinkers get drunk 100-150 times a year. Green said the most
abusive drinkers, or dependent drinkers, get drunk 200 or more times a year.

‘“‘Why would you want what I have? Would you really want to give up
your alcohol?’’ Green asked.

He said there is a happy medium between alcoholism and abstinence.
‘You can have your alcohol and not be an alcoholic,’’ Green said.
Green concluded, ‘‘Don’t stop [drinking], slow down!”

Semester At Sea, administered by
the Institute for Shipboard Education
and academically sponsored by the
University of Pittsburgh, is a program
that takes about 500 students from
colleges and universities across the
Unites States and abroad, each fall
and spring semester. Students can
choose from 50 lower and upper
division courses in a variety of dis-
ciplines.

Courses offered are accredited by
the University of Pittsburgh and are
fully transferable to the students

with closed circuit television capabi-
lities, a library, theater, student union
and cafeteria. It also includes a
swimming pool, basketball and vol-
leyball court, and a weight room. A

City to debate
zoning law

By Rick Peltz
Editor

 

 

A proposed change to city zoning laws might block
students from new housing opportunities and will be the
subject of an 8 p.m. public hearing at City Hall today.

Current law mandates that no more than four unrelated
people can live in a single family home. Exceptions to
the law are allowed with permits renewed annually.

One proposed amendment will forbid the issuing of
new permits, though owners with permits can continue
to apply for annual renewal.

Another proposal will reduce the number of unrelated
people allowed to live together from four to three.

On Nov. 1, 1990, the city council unanimously
imposed a one-year moratorium against issuing permits.

At that meeting, community leaders and Washington
and Lee students debated the issue.

Dorothy Cecil, president of the Rockbridge Area
Neighborhood League, urged passage of the moratorium
as well as a phase-out of existing large-capacity houses,
those protected by permits.

Cecil said there had been complaints about students in
all areas of Lexington.

A letter from Donald and Patricia M. Thomas of
Morningside Drive also supported the moratorium.

‘Each new student housing unit makes it increasingly
difficult for local residents to find affordable housing and
furthers the process of disruption and the eventual
destruction of this community,’’ the Thomases wrote.

Young discussed the access VMI
students have to W&L housing.

‘I was distressed to find that
VMI first-classmen are able to come
and go as they please on weekend
nights. If they are not legitimate
guests, however, they have no busi-
ness here,’’ said Young.

According to VMI Public Infor-

and sophomore cadets who are
granted weekend leave and do not
live in Rockbridge County are re-
quired to remain outside the county
until Sunday at 11 p.m. If the cadets

barracks.

VMI seniors may spend their
weekends in or outside of the county.

‘‘The problem, however, is that
these liberated students are trying to
stay overnight with our women in the
dorms,”’ said Young.

‘‘The cadets are welcome as long
as they are invited here, are in the
company of W&L students, if they
behave themselves and most impor-
tantly as long as they are within the
rules of VMI,’’ said Young.

Young stressed that W&L’s guest

Fifteen of the women who were
raped or sexually assaulted said al-
cohol was a factor in the incident.
Schroer-Lamont said when alcohol is
involved, people blame the victim and
the victim often blames herself.

‘‘Whenever alcohol is involved,
women become more judgmental of
each other,’’ Schroer-Lamont said.
‘*There’s not room for judgement in
these cases.”’

All together, 31 of last year’s
freshman woman reported being vic-
tims of sexual assault, rape or incest.

Schroer-Lamont said several women
were victims of more than one inci-
dent of sexual abuse.

Many women choose not to report
rapes or sexual assaults to the police
or W&L administration because they
are afraid they might be blamed for
the incident or they may be shunned
by friends, Schroer-Lamont said.

The Confidential Review Commit-
tee, which handles cases of sexual
assault or rape involving W&L stu-
dents, provides an alternative to re-
porting incidents to the police or not
reporting them at all.

However, Schroer-Lamont said the
CRC does not have a reputation for
confidentiality because of the way the
two cases they have adjudicated were
handled.

“With the first two cases, the
university was learning the system
through the cases,’’ Schroer-Lamont
said.

‘The first two were not very con-
fidential, because of people talking
about the cases. I think if there had
been more cases, then the CRC
would have a different reputation.”’

The worst thing a sexual assault
or rape victim can do is try to forget
the whole incident, Schroer-Lamont
said.

‘“T just want to put it behind me’
is one of the worst things a woman
can say,’’ Schroer-Lamont said.

“Until she deals with the incident
in counseling, it will just crop up in
some other way,’’ Schroer-Lamont
said.

with optimism.

“Our whole bench thought we
were going to win the game,”’ said
Fallon. ‘‘We got the onside kick, but
then we had a miss in communica-
tions.’’

Needing just over 25 yards and
out of timeouts, Fallon called for
Steiner to try to hit Kreis with a
deep pass. Kreis cut one way, and
Steiner’s pass went another and was
intercepted, and Davidson held on for
the win.

“T hadn’t worked with Jeff long
enough to know that if he saw his
route was covered that he’d break it
off,”’ said Steiner. ‘‘It was painful to
lose that way, but it was a good
feeling to play that tough anyway.”’

Steiner hit 10 of 16 passes for
153 yards and two touchdowns, the
, best day by a W&L quarterback this
year. Seven different Generals caught
at least one pass. Kreis led the way
with three catches for 54 yards and
one touchdown.

Defensively, the Generals were led

by senior John McCallum who regist-

ered 18 tackles and a sack on the
day. Senior Scott Williamson and
Smith each had 12 tackles. Smith
now has 93 tackles through five
games.

Though the loss dropped the Gen-
erals to 0-5 on the season, Fallon
said you wouldn’t know the team was
0-5 from looking at them.

‘I’m encouraged with the way we
came back,’’ he said. ‘‘I like the
style in which we did it. The kids are
playing their fannies off. They aren’t
playing like they are 0-5. They
weren’t off the field yet Saturday
before they were thinking about
Hampden-Sydney. They’re fired up
about the game, and that’s what it’s
all about.”’

The Generals will play the Tigers
at 1:30 Saturday in Hampden-
Sydney, Va. The Tigers are 2-2-1
overall and 1-2 in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference. They average 27
points a game offensively, but yield
almost 26.

It’s not if you win or
lose, but how you play...

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

It may be one of the biggest cliches in the book, and one I’m sure you
heard when you were growing up, but now more than ever, it can be
applied right here at Washington and Lee. It’s not whether you win or
lose, it’s how you play the game.

Washington and Lee is an NCAA Division III institution and is one
of the top academic schools in the nation. W&L does not offer athletic
scholarships, and it is a frequent — and almost required occurrence — to
see athletes miss practice and the occasional game due to academic
responsibilities.

This is not Southern Methodist University, where the alumni reward(ed)
football players with substantial amounts of money. This is not Ferrum,
where a student-athlete is more the athlete — especially during football
season — and almost not a student. This is Washington and Lee, where
it is an unchallenged truth that academics comes before athletics.

And at W&L this fall, our football team is struggling. It is winless in
its first five games. But, if ever there was an instance to apply the cliche,
this is it. Aside from the academic responsibilities of his players, head
coach Gary Fallon has had his work cut out for him.

He was perhaps the hardest hit coach by 1991's graduation. On
offense, seven starters did not return to the team, including four offensive
linemen, the school’s second all-time leading receiver, and the school’s
fifth leading rusher and third leading scorer. On this year’s offense, only
three players are starting where they started last year. One moved over
from defense, one changed positions on the line, and one moved from
quarterback to split end. This team may be the most inexperienced team
Fallon has coached.

Last week against Davidson, for various reasons, Fallon’s team had
nine freshmen play a majority of the minutes.

So look more at the way the team is handling itself on the field rather
than at the scoreboard. Last week’s game with Davidson showed that the
team has far from thrown in the towel. They continue to work hard, as
Fallon says, harder than you might expect an 0-5 team to work.

And remember one thing, they aren’t here to play football. They play
because they love the game. And despite the losing, they are still working
hard. ‘‘They are fired up about the game, and that’s what it’s all about.”’

Sooner or later, the hard work will pay off and the team will get that
first win. So don’t get down on them because they haven’t won. They’re
working hard and having fun, and at this level, while winning is nice, it’s
more about how you play the game.

Harriers top
Lynchburg
in upset

By Jacob Kimball
Staff Reporter

 

 

“Sweet victory.”

That’s all that Washington and
Lee men’s cross country coach John
Tucker could say as he savored the
stunning upset his Generals pulled off
in Washington, D.C.

W&L faced host Catholic Univer-
sity at the meet, as well as Lynch-
burg College, the top team in the
Division III Southeast Region. Make
that the former top team in the
region.

Lynchburg came into the meet
undefeated and fully expected to
leave that way. But that was not to
be the case.

Carried by the outstanding perfor-
mance of W&L’s tandem of Bo
Hannah and Charles Edwards, the
Generals easily outdistanced Catholic
18-37, but barely out-pointed LC 27-
28.

Tucker said the race was “‘thri-
lling from a spectator’s perspective,’’
although for him it was a nail-biter.

 

 

 

 

Bo Hannah
..has led W&L In each race

Showing that his early season
success is no fluke, Hannah ran neck
and neck with LC’s all-american
Greg Cavaliere. In a personal duel
throughout the race, Hannah forged
ahead by the slightest margin as the
finish came into view, but he was
outsprinted to the line.

Hannah’s finish of 26:24 was just
four seconds off the pace. Edwards,
with a fourth place overall finish in
26:56, is beginning to approach peak
form as he ran his best race of the
season to date.

But, Tucker was quick to point
out that Hannah and Edwards are not
a two-man team. ‘We could not have
won without the tremendous showings
from our third, fourth , and fifth
runners,’’ he said.

Keith Rinn, Matthew Brock, and
Lee Parker, respectively, all finished
ahead of LC’s fourth runner. Rinn
led the trio with a personal record
time of 27:54. Close behind with the
finishes that insured the victory were
Brock at 28:05 and tri-captain Parker
at 28:21.

“Tt was a satisfying win and
confidence booster,’ said Tucker.
“The guys are pumped up and
focused [for next week’s meet]."’

On Saturday, the Generals run in
the Virginia State meet. W&L will
run against the Division II and III
schools in the state, including a re-
match with Lynchburg.

There comes a point in every
team’s season when they face a mo-
ment of truth: one play, one quarter,
one half that becomes a catapult to a
higher level of play.

For the Washington and Lee
men’s soccer team, that moment of
truth was the second half of Satur-
day’s 2-1 victory over Greensboro.
And by the look of the team during
Wednesday’s win over Old Dominion
Athletic Conference foe Eastern Men-
nonite, 4-1, the team has been cata-
pulted to a higher level of play.

Prior to the Greensboro game, the
Generals had lost three of their last
four games and it looked like their
impressive beginning was all for
naught. The first half of the Greens-
boro game lent itself to this thinking
as well.

A give-away on a goal kick led to
the first Greensboro score, and it was
the type of play that takes the wind

ghts ship

out of some teams’ sails.

However, after the goal the Gen-
erals began to play sharper soccer.
They put the clamps on Greensboro
and allowed them only one good
chance the rest of the game.

“It was pretty nice [the defensive
play],’’ said head coach Rolf Pir-
anian. ‘‘The first half was spotty and
sloppy. The second half, though, was
one of the best halves of soccer this
year.”’

The Generals came out in the
second half and played inspired soc-
cer. This type of play paid off mid-
way through when senior tri-captain
Jeff Zieger scored his first goal of
the season, It tied the score at one,
the goal also ended a scoring drought
which had reached five halves.

But the play of the game, the
game-winning goal, signaled a new
attitude for the Generals. Bobby
Weisgerber sprinted 20 yards to save
the ball from going out of bounds,
then turned down the sideline, beat
his defender, and laid a beautiful

On a day when many who had
played Washington and Lee football
in the past were in attendance, those
quite new to W&L football gave
them quite a show.

With former All-American split
end Craig Irons looking on, there was
freshman William Propst making a
diving catch at the Davidson five-
yard line with just over one minute
left.

With W&L’s leading rusher from
the past three seasons Mason Pope
looking on, there was freshman runn-
ing back Michael MacLane catching
a 12-yard touchdown pass for the
Generals first score.

And with all the former stars in
attendance, freshman quarterback
Geren Steiner stole the show.

Entering the game with W&L
trailing 16-0 late in the third quarter
when starting quarterback Fred Ren-
neker went down with an ankle in-
jury, Steiner rallied the Generals, with
a kick start from Davidson.

After sacking Steiner on his first
two plays to set up a fourth down
and 54 at the W&L 18, Davidson
committed the biggest faux-pas in
football. They ran into W&L punter

Bob Ehret, giving the Generals a first
down.

Given new life, Steiner took over.
He marched the Generals 67 yards in
12 plays, hitting tight end Wilson
Moore for a gain of 16, fullback
Mark Goglia for a gain of 12 and
then MacLane for the final 12 and
the score. The two-point conversion
failed, and Davidson led 16-6.

Steiner said he wasn’t that ner-
vous being forced into action. ‘‘I
didn’t know I was going to play.
Everything happened so quick that I
really didn’t have time to get ner-
vous,”’ he said.

“The roughing the kicker was a
big break for us,’’ said head coach
Gary Fallon. ‘‘It gave us some mo-
mentum back and got our defense
some valuable rest. The offense was
on the field for 26 straight plays and
came away with a score.”’

W&L’s well-rested defense then
gave the offense the ball back when
junior Lyle Smith recovered a David-
son fumble. Davidson got the ball
back, though, when the offense came
up short on fourth down.

“I have to admire our kids,’’ said
Fallon. ‘‘When we missed the first
two-point conversion, they could have
thrown in the towel, but they didn’t.
Then we give the ball back to them,
force a fourth down, and they fake a

with two wins

crossing pass in front of the goal,
where Reid Murphy deftly directed
the ball into the lower comer of the
goal for the winner.

“Emotionally, it [the Greensboro
win] was the turing point,’’ said
keeper Mike Steinbrook. ‘‘The at-
titude of the team has definitely
changed. Now we have to keep the
intensity level high.’’

“Tt was an inspiring half of soc-
cer,’ a pleased Piranian said.
‘*Things weren’t looking too good in
the first half. It was a good win.”’

However, the victory would have
been empty if the Generals hadn't
solidified it by beating Eastern Men-
nonite on Wednesday. And they won
emphatically.

Freshman Sam Drennan opened
the scoring late in the first half when
EMC’s goalie left a rebound out. in
front of the goal. The Royals came
back to tie the game early in the
second half, but that was it.

Junior Michael Hill scored the
next two goals within three minutes

of each other to give the Generals a
3-1 lead. Again, both goals came as
a result of the keeper leaving re-
bounds out in front of the goal. Mur-
phy closed out the scoring with his
team-leading fifth goal on a penalty
kick late in the game.

“It’s nice to have a big win with
a lot of goals,’’ said Weisgerber after
the Eastern Mennonite win. ‘‘We’re
having a good time now. Players and
coaches are in a good mood. We
have a new motto, every time we’re
out there it’s ‘a great college soccer
practice.’ It’s just fun to be out
there.’’

The two victories upped the Gen-
erals’ mark to 6-3-2, 3-2-0 in the
ODAC. The ODAC win total matches
that of last year’s team with two
games to go. Saturday, the Generals
take the trip to Va. Beach to play
powerhouse Virginia Wesleyan.

The following Saturday, the Gen-
erals play their final game before the
ODAC Tournament at Lynchburg.

 

 

 

Senior Alan Herrick defends against an Army defender in action
from a year ago. Last week at the Eastern Water Polo Association

 

By Andrew Fox
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee water
polo team traveled to Rhode Island
this past weekend with revenge on its
mind,

Though W&L faced tough
matches against the University of
Massachusetts, Army, and Villanova
the Generals were determined to
avenge two early-season losses to
Richmond.

According to W&L head coach
Page Remillard, the EPWA allowed
the Generals strong bench play to
shine despite losses to UMass, 6-5
and Army 16-12.

In the opening match against
1Sth-ranked UMass, the W&L de-
fense was characteristically stingy as
sophomores Greg Golub and Jake
Berman contributed five steals apiece
while goalies P.J. Waicus and
Michael Flippen combined for six
blocks. The scoring load fell on the
shoulders of seniors Will Davis and

John Kannapell, who scored two
goals each. Alan Herrick, another
senior, added the other goal.

W&L had its chances offensively,
but could not capitalize on seven
man-up scoring opportunities doomed
their chances for victory and wasted
the defensive effort.

Against Villanova, the W&L
offense exploded in a 14-12 double
overtime win receiving five goals
apiece from Davis and Herrick. Des-
pite the high offensive production,
Remillard felt the close game with
U.Mass caused the Generals’ perfor-
mance to be lackluster at best.

‘*We were still feeling the effects
of the previous game,’’ he said, ‘‘but
we showed we have the ability to
come from behind to win a match.’’

After trailing early in the first
half, W&L rallied to take an 8-7
halftime lead. In the third and fourth
quarters both teams played even until
the second overtime when W&L
outscored their opponent 2-1 to se-
cure the victory.

tournament In Providence, R.I., Herrick scored eight goals in two
wins, Including the game-winner in overtime against Villanova.

Polo gets revenge against Richmond

Against Army, the emotional drain
of two close games appeared to have
caught up with the Generals, Similar
problems that plagued W&L in the
UMass game cropped up again in
their 16-12 loss. The Generals offense
was only able to take advantage of
four of seven man-up scoring oppor-
tunities, while Army hit on three
goals on four attempts. Though W&L
was clearly outplayed by Army, Rem-
illard felt that with work the team
could be just as good if not better
than Army.

Despite Remillard’s confidence
after the Army game, frustration
plagued the Generals in the first half
of their final game with Richmond.
After falling behind 5-0 in the first
half it appeared as if the Generals
were headed for their third straight
defeat at the hands of the Spiders,

‘After falling behind 5-0, we
called the team together and dis-
banded with any strategy and went
back to the basics,’’ Remillard said.

Apparently, the tactic worked as
the Generals outscored the Spiders

12-4 in the final three quarters to win
12-9. Though W&L suffered prob-
lems early, excellent play by the
bench was one of the main reasons
for the team’s come from behind
victory.

“Our bench players have im-
proved more than Richmond's bench
players and the starting lineup is
confident that they can come into a
game and preserve leads,’’ Remillard
said.

Though Remillard is pleased with
bench performance, he hopes that the
play of the goalies will become more
aggressive.

‘Our goalies must compete better
to deny opponents from scoring,’’ he
said. ‘*We still have the best goalies
in terms of talent but they need to
find the desire to be the best they
can be.”’

W&L, 9-7 on the season, will
take a break from game action. Next
up for the Generals is the Southern
Conference Tournament to be held at
Twombly Pool in three weeks.

punt and get a first down. And our,
kids still don’t throw the towel in.”

W&L didn’t give up, they buckled’
down and forced the Wildcats to punt,
again, this time getting the ball at
their own 25 with 2:32 left.

Immediately, W&L went on the,
attack. Steiner hit senior Jeff Kreis
for a gain of 32 on the second play.’

Steiner said that once the offense
got going, confidence just kept build-’
ing. ’
“The play to Jeff let everyone,
know that we were still in the
game,’’ he said. ‘‘But the biggest,
play was the one after that. William
made a great catch.”’

Two plays later, Steiner hit the,
diving Propst for 39 yards, setting up
a nine-yard scoring pass from Steiner ‘
to Kreis. On the play, Steiner bob- ,
bled the snap but was still able to
recover and hit Kreis for the touch- ;
down.

Down by four with 51 seconds’
left, Steiner took care of the two-,
point conversion himself, running for
the score after his receivers were '
covered. ;

W&L then attempted and re-
covered an onside kick. When senior :

ball, the Generals were overflowing '

performance of sophomo-e goalie
Kate Stimeling, who had 13 saves in
the Emory contest.

She also commended the play of
senior Ashley Hurt and sophomore

Aspen Yawars, who scored the lone ,

goal against Emory, commenting that
they both have been ‘‘incredible’’ in
the past two games.

“‘We played a very good team in
Emory. What we needed for that
game was something I wasn’t sure
we had,’ Hathorn said. ‘‘But we
played a whole new level of soccer
that we have never been tmily able to
keep up with before.”’

She was also pleased with the *

team’s performance at Roanoke.

“The Roanoke game was the first
year that we just played even with
them the whole game,’ she said.
“*We were just as good as they were
in every respect, and that was a giant
step.”’

The Generals, now 4-1-1 in the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
and 4-3-2 overall, met Hollins Wed-
nesday in an away game.

“If we get complacent and think
that Hollins is not a tough team, and

play down to their level, we could ”
walk away with a scary near win or ,

even a loss,’’ the coach said.

She need not have worried. After
a scoreless first half, the Generals
scored twice in the second half for a
2-0 win. Sophomores Angie Car-
rington and Corinda Hankins scored
the goals, and Stimeling registered
her 14th career shutout. She made
just two saves as the Generals out-
shot Hollins 23-2.

Hathom, though, is still worried
about W&L’s lack of offense.

“Once we can start putting the
ball in the goal a little more often,
that’s really the last thing we need to
work on,”’ she said.

Offense is the expertise of first-
year assistant coach Shari Krasnoo.

‘The players need to fill the goal
with the ball in response to what she

has taught them,’’ Hathorn
“‘Shari’s done a great job.’’

The Generals will get the oppor-
tunity to score against Methodist
Saturday on the Liberty Hall Field,
Methodist reached the NCAA semi-
finals last year.
