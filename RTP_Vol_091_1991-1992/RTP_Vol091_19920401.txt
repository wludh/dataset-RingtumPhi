Washington and Lee's Con-
fidential Review Committee forcibly
took control of all university depart-
ments and services Monday and be-
gan implementing what it called ac-
tions “appropriate and necessary to
rid the school of unsensitive persons.”

Beginning at dawn, members
of the CRC, along with 2500 gun-
toting PC mercenaries from the Uni-
versity of lowa, went through every
building on campus and removed de-
partment heads from their offices, leav-
ing in their places physically-, men-
tally-, sexually-, ethnically-, and ver-
tically-challenged persons to maintain
control.

According to the always-

W&L alumni line up for the firing squad Monday afternoon. Their bodies were dragged back to
campus and tied to the cqlumns on the collonade where passing women and minorities were

encouraged to spit on them.

SPES get
new name

 

straightforward University Public
Relations Director Brian Shaw, there
was only minimal opposition to the
takeover from faculty members. But
at least 73 white male students were
killed or wounded while defending
Dr. Jefferson Davis Futch's office be-
fore it, too, was taken by the CRC.
After his capture, Futch was beaten
senseless by CRC henchwoman Anice
McCloud and left for dead on the front
lawn.

Moments after the takeover
was complete, CRC Chairwoman Joan
Shaughnessy had herself crowned
Empress of W&L. She allowed CRC
member Allan Vestal to be crowned
emperor, but said Vestal agreed to be
under her control at all times.

“Vestal is an enlightened man
and he realizes he needs to be opressed
by me a little to make up for what his
ancestors did before he was even con-
ceived,” Shaughnessy said. -

By noon, with her CRC
troops firmly in control of the school,
Shaunessy was able to begin her “‘pro-
gram of enlightenment” which in-
cluded mass executions, public cas-
trations and mandatory multi-cultural
slideshows and lectures.

A group of 13 alumni was
executed by firing squad on the prac-
tice football field at 1 om.
Shaughnessy explained her reasons
for ordering their deaths.

“They were white men, that's
all the reason I needed,” she said.

Next, Shaughnessy turned
her wrath on sophomore Billy John
Baker.

“I was in the bathroom and I

overheard two girls in the next stall
say Billy John had whistled at one of
them,” Shaughnessy said. “The boy
needed to be taught a lesson.”

Baker was taken to arally in
the gym and castrated, without
anasthetic, in front of hundreds of
cheering, bra-waving W&L women.

Later that afternoon, the CRC
voted 5-2 to execute EC President
Giles Perkins. He was burned at the
stake.

On Tuesday, Shaughnessy
held a press conference before her
first full day of work as Empress of
W&L.

Shaughnessy said she
recieved had calls of support from the
deans of seven, well-respected north-
eastern schools. She plans toremain in
control of W&L indefinetly.

“My committee's continued
control is necessary to set things
straight, uh, ' mean right, uh, no, I
mean correct,” * she said.

Who survived the coup?

University President John Wilson: dismissed from post but.

jithout injury, “He's never around anyways,” CRC said. -
Dean of Students D d Howison: remains Dean, butno
longer allowed to attend SAC meetings. “Maybe we'll get dut of ©
meetings faster since we won't have to ‘chat’,” said one member,
EC President Giles Perkins: Burned at the stake. Shaughnessy |
herself lit the copies of the U.S. Constitution used as fuel.
IFC President Greg Hicks: left in post, but forced to go on a
date with 6'5" woman lacrosse player who rapes him since ‘she
paid for dinner.” CRC hopes iFC will now help curd date rape.
PHC President Carrie Eubanks: Promoted to under-empress of
W&L. PHC also given de facto control over fraternities,
University Infirmary: now must perform abortions on demand. —

 

 

Delts get none

University President John D. Wilson announced
today that he is overriding the Student Affairs Committee
and lowering Delta Tau Delta’s penalty for its December
house-trashing to nothing.

“T really didn’t understand what happened at
Delt because SAC screwed up so bad,” Wilson said. “The
Delt president and v p showed me the light.”

“Basically we told John that one of the Phi
editors was solely responsible for all the damage to the
house, and the whole Phi staff collaborated in a con-
spiracy to make Delt look bad,” said the Delt vp “Really,
it’s true. That’s why we expelled him. He would do
anything within his power to hurt us, even witchcraft. We
think there’s been witchcraft.”

Wilson said it was clear to him that SAC asked
all the wrong questions of the Delts.

“SAC asked questions like, ‘what happened?,’
‘what did you do about it?,’ etc.,” Wilson said. “That was
all wrong. I wanted to talk about the future.”

“Talking Jeger the past is always so difficult,” ¢
Delt spokesman said, “Then you might really have oe
responsibility for your actions. Talking about the future
is easier, because since it is hasn’t happened yet, nobody
knows what’s true and what’s not.”

SPECIAL PHI INVESTIGATIVE REPORT

Hoping to cash in on the
wave of sensitivity sweeping the cam-
pus since the CRC's takeover, mem-
bers of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity
announced this morning that mem-
bers are offended by the term “SPE.”

SPE President Ivan Attitude
said SPE has not always minded be-
ing called SPE, but since SPE nation-
als said SPE nationally is broken up
about the SPE term, SPE should go.

Attitude said SPE members
would rather be known as “that sen
sitive bunch of guys at the end of Lee
Avenue,” or “TSBOGATELA,” pro-
nounced, “SBOGATELA,” just like
“Tsongas,” who is not a SPE.

W&L Empress Joan
Shaughnessy said even though the
SPES were abunch of men, she would
issue a decree than anyone calling the
SPES SPES would be shot on site
(unless they were women, minorities
or ugly).

The Ring-tum Phi of course
offered its full cooperation to SPE,
saying the newspaper would hence
forth call all SPEs something differ-
ent than SPEs, so that the newspaper
could affect and alter people’s opin
ions and vocabularies, just like every
one knows they try to do.

“We're really excited about
changing SPEs to somet
than SPEs,” a Phis Sf ag in, who is
not a SPE, said. “The SPEs will be
eSPEcially happy with us.’

Composite Q. Reporter did not turn
in a story this week because s/he
wasn't feeling well, and s/he had

trouble getting in touch with
people. Oh yeah, s/he also can't
write the story, because Dean
Howison asked that we not write
anything about that

 

 

Did Mock Convention's
nomination of Bill Clinton
influence Paul Tsongas
decision to quit?

 

So at first we were going to just
stay up ‘til 3 a.m. and write the
story ourselves like we usually do
Then we decided to just stop the
presses and not come out this
week at all. Finally we decided, oh
well, it's not the reporter's fault,
after all. Let's just put a nice box
there instead

Lost March 26, 1992

R.T. ‘Smiley’ or
Weekly World?

This week we present you with two views of the Phi
of the future. The choice is yours. Which one do you
want?

R.T. ‘Smiley’ Phi — This is the official ‘‘news’’paper
of the idyllic Washington and Lee that the administration
and most students dream about. Nothing bad ever happens.
Everybody knows and respects one another. Students,
faculty and staff walk around 24 hours a day with a smile
securely painted on their faces. Too bad such a place
doesn’t exist, but this is the Phi everyone seems to think
they want ...

The Weekly World Phi — So you thought you could
compare The Ring-tum Phi to a supermarket tabloid? We
don’t think so. This paper leads with an exclusive expose
on Dean Atkins’ genitalia and goes down from there. It
truly lives up to its ever present motto: ‘‘We’re Gonna
Get Ya!”

That’s all folks,
we're outta here!

OK ... on a more serious note ... take a deep breath
and relax. As you’ve probably guessed, this is the Phi’s
annual parody issue. None of the news stories this week
are either real or serious. In fact, any resemblance to
persons either living or dead are purely intentional.
Particularly to those who are living.

By this time every year, the paper has usually pissed
off so many people that we take this opportunity to
shamelessly pander for your affection by trying to make
you laugh. But if that doesn’t work, we really don’t care.
It’s our last issue! Today we begin a futile attempt to
make up a semester of work in just eight days. In the
spring, the new Editorial Board will take over ... and if
you think you’re happy to see us go, you can’t possibly
comprehend what it means to us.

Have a nice day.

The Ring-tum Phi is published Thursdays during the undergraduate
school year at Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Virginia.
Funding for The Ring-tum Phi comes primarily from advertising, but,
sadly, also from a portion of the student activities fee. The Washington and
Lee Publications Board elects the chief editors and business manager, but
The Ring-tum Phi is otherwise independent and likes it that way.
Letters, submissions and dirty pictures must be in the Phi office, Room
208 of the University Center, by noon Tuesday to appear in that week’s

I’VE CHANGED

By Nile “The River” Macado

 

  

Those of you who know me realize that I am rarely
aman without words (that is, rarely a man). But here I am
speechless. I am so ashamed of the things I have said on
these pages during the past months. It is now the time for
true confessions.

I’ve changed. While reading the Law Wives’ calm
and polite response to my last diatribe, I realized that they
are correct. They are not the ones that misunderstand, I am.
It’s not the values of this fine country that are warped and
twisted, I am. It is not the Spectator that is vomit, I am. I
am, in fact, not part of the solution, I am part of the
problem.

The good Law Wives were quite correct at pointing
out that I am Canadian. I would like to apologize to my
fellow countrymen remaining north of the border for the
embarrassment I have wrought. I am a hypocrite. Every-

s thing has been handed to me, and I have given’ back

 

 

nothing but trouble. That settles it, from now on I’m a
Republican. No more letters from me. I feel right at home
here at W&L.

Ed. note: Yeah, right. Nile, oh Nile, you are puerile, vile
and make me smile, Get back to your Parisian memoirs.

Administrators plan CRC takeover

 

My BRAIN’S FRIED

By John ‘‘Zero-Point-Zero’’ Blutarski

 

A member of The Ring-tum Phi’s intrepid
investigative reporting team sneaks a microphone
into an executive meeting in the President of the
University’s inner sanctum. Names have been
altered to protect the not-so-innocent. The evil
plotters are: University President Johnny Stilson,
Dean of Students Davey Howler and Dean for Co-
educational Affairs Mrs. Scheer-LaRoue.

ek
Stilson: This meeting will come to order, with me
in charge, of course (ha, ha, I love power).
Howler: Oh, yes sir, that sounds quite good to me.
Scheer-LaRoue: Why does he get to be in charge
all the time, hmm? Sounds like male chauvinism,
if you ask me!
Stilson: We didn’t. (Bangs gavel) We are here to
discuss that muckraking, back-stabbing rag, that
filthy piece of yellow journalism, that ... student
publication.
Howler: The Spectator?
Stilson: No, you idiot, the Phi!
Howler: (Fawning) Oh yes, quite right, sir!
Stilson: And that sneaky little columnist of their’s,
Sparrow —
Scheer-LaRoue: Swann.
Stilson: Sparrow, swan, parakeet... who cares? This
libelist should be strung by his ...
Scheer-LaRoue: Go ahead, say it, sir! Go ahead,
you can do it!
Stilson: Vulgarity doesn’t fit my new urbane
image. By the way, Davey, are the students going
for it?
Howler: Oh, sir, yes sir, they love it. Your popu-

Cramps bother
depressed dean

Dear Phi Guys:

I have this little problem, and I hope you can
help me. Upon returning from a relaxing Christ-
mas break, I sat down at my desk with about
1,200 upperclassmen fall term grade reports.
You know, parents love to see their little kid
complemented on his report card ...

I was in the middle of writing my little
messages ... you know the type: ‘‘Your son is a
really nice kid. I see him in my office all the
time.’’ ‘‘Don’t worry Chris has a full year to get
his grade-point-average above a 2.0.’’ and the
ever popular, ‘‘I failed calculus, too!’’ When
just then I began developing this sharp pain in
my arm which eventually spread to my neck and
the rest of my body.

So, I began consulting with doctors and
chiropractors. I took medication and attempted
neck-extension therapy with Tom Jones in the
Training Room. When all else failed, I resorted
to acu-puncture treatment. I was finally told to
sleep on my side instead of my stomach. BUT
1 ALWAYS SLEEP ON MY STOMACH! I
CAN’T SLEEP! I AM BECOMING UNSTA-
BLE! This has been going on for 11 weeks
now. What should I do? I’ve considered filing
law suits against W&L for on-the-job-abuse,
against the students for getting grades and
against the doctor who told me to sleep on my
side. Please give me some advice. I have to do
the grade reports again in just two weeks!

Eagerly awaiting your reply,
Davey Howison
Dean of Students

Ed. note — Listen Davey, sue the university,
they'll just raise tuition to cover it. But don’t
sign the agreement until you get your own
building on the Colonnade. Just think of it:
Howison Hall ... your name in lights. No more
being forced to sit in front of the Co-op for you!
Next, make up a stamp that says ‘‘Your doing a
great job. — DH’’ and see to it that everyone
gets straight A’s ... Oh, yeah ... don’t forget to
sleep on your side.

 

 

Listen in as the university
president and his crack team of
barracudas destroy civil liberties
on this campus forever!

 

larity is catching up to the President’s!
Stilson: Excellent ... now about this Swann charac-
ter.
Scheer-LaRoue: Obviously a sexually-deviant
male, or highly repressed. Needs a mother figure.
Stilson: All I know is the sneaky little bastard
verbally assaulted Leroy last fall.
Howler: Oh, that wasn’t nice, sir. Certainly not
good at all to attack the Dean of Social Affairs and
Promiscuity.
Scheer-LaRoue: Called him a toad, didn’t he?
Obviously referring subconsciously to himself.
Definite sexual problems.
Stilson: And that entire staff! Who do they think
they are, mucking about with the Delt decision?
Howler: That’s right, sir, if they hadn’t blabbed
we'd have kicked those punks right off campus.
Stilson: And who the hell leaked the car tax bit?
Bettcha it that do-gooder Brian Shaw had some-
thing to do with it. Everything he says is bullshit!
Scheer-LaRoue: Too bad Homer’s deal with the
University fell through, isn’t it? I would have
gotten a whole new Womyn’s Center, too.
Howler: Uh, sir? You don’t think there’s ... well,
a microphone hidden somewhere in here, do you?
**Tense silence**
Stilson: (Guffawing) You mean The Spectator?
I’ve got those fools in my back pocket. Next week
they’ll attack the Buildings and Grounds people

LETTERS

A message from
Her Majesty

To the Editors:

There have been many false and truly
harassing reports of what precipitated my recent
ascension as “The Almighty Empress of
Washington and Lee, Protector of the
Everlasting Honor.’’ This letter is to set the
record straight. I don’t expect ya'll to
understand, after all you’re both white males
(and soon to be dead).

The tension on this campus has been growing
steadily for about the past 250 years: fraternities
are bad, this school is named after two dead
slave-owners, the white male-dominated elector-
ate continues to vote for other white males and
just yesterday somebody implied that I was
ugly. Obviously something had to change.

But the changes will be minimal. The school
will remain where it is, we will just be changing
the name to Homerville Community College.
The Honor System and other vestiges of student
government will remain intact, they will just be
carefully overseen by members of the CRC.
Free elections will continue, as usual, just we
will screen the candidates and implement a
proportional voting system to benefit the under-
represented minorities. Finally, we will not
tamper with the civil liberties of the students
here unless they do not know when to censor
themselves.

The current 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. curfew should
only be necessary for a few years. So, sit back
and relax ... there’s nothing you can do. Have
fun with you issue this week — it’s your last.

 

Regally yours,
Her Royal Majesty
Queen Joan |

Ed. Note: To all you who wrote
to us this past year ... | hope |
never see another letter again!

instead of me... AGAIN.
Scheer-LaRoue: When you say ‘‘back pocket,’’ do
you mean anything inherently sexual about —
Stilson: Oh shut up. To continue ... what do we do
about this deranged columnist?
Scheer-LaRoue: I suggest extensive psycho-thera-
py. Put him ... I mean, the case, into my hands.
Howler: I don’t know, sir, he’s got a cult follow-
ing among the students. It could backlash.
Stilson: A following?
Howler: Sick people, sir, but extremely loyal.
Stilson;: How come / don’t have a following?
Check on it! Can’t the CRC do anything about
him?

** Pquse**
Howler: My sources say he was seen drinking at
the Palms last weekend. And he was seen dancing
at the Fiji house.
Scheer-LaRoue: Definitely sexually-deprived.
Stilson: No, the entire student body drinks at the
Palms, so do the profs... So do I. And the Fiji thing
won't wash, either — that might make him desper-
ate, but not immoral.
Scheer-LaRoue: Maybe I could persuade some of ‘
my female disciples to —
Stilson: No, the man’s an English major. Moral
character’s too strong.

** Pquse**
Howler: I’ve got it! (murmured whispers...our
intrepid reporter can’t catch the words)
Stilson: By God, Davey, that just might work!
Now nobody on this campus will be subject to
ridicule or harassment ever again ...

CRC takes control;
reign of terror begins

Lawyers thankful
for building sale

To the Editor:

As a law-firm having recently moved to
Lexington, we would like to take this opportuni-
ty to publicly thank the Washington and Lee
University administration for the warm welcome
they have extended to us. Specifically, we refer
to the brochure we received detailing the scho-
ol’s excellent opportunities to express monetary
generosity.

Since, having originated our firm in Houston,
we have gobs of liquid assets with which to
paper this municipality, the aforementioned
brochure was particularly helpful. Our original
intent of giving the city a fleet of brand-spank-
in’ new parking scooters was clearly upstaged
by the recently donated snorkel fire truck. So,
instead we have decided upon item C in the
brochure: ‘‘prominent Colonnade building
named for donor, with endowed professorship.”’

Frankly, we were at first concerned with
defacing the natural greenery and beauty of the
Colonnade, but the information packet from
President Wilson and the Board of Trustees
quelled any such fears. The Faculty/Student
Opinion Cross-Section was what really did the
trick. We found the comments of a Dr. Satz in
the mathematics department most moving:
‘There just aren’t enough buildings around here
to piddle on!’’ Satz said. ‘Besides, each new
slab of concrete means one or two less trees for
cats to climb up.’’ Even now, we stifle tears at
the beauty of that sentiment.

One again, thank you.

Sincerely,
Dewey, Skrewum and Howe
Attorneys at Law

Theater men
dress up and
get down

By Homo Puosic
Archie Bunker Wanna Be

 

 

After a long year of thought provoking
drama, three senior theater majors dress up in their
most stunning outfits and dance the night away to
their favorite Village People tunes. Theirimpromptu
performance of "Kick Me There, I'll Kick Your Ass"
received a standing ovation from students assembled
in front of the co-op.

Butch Browning, donning a pink tutu and
stunning pink toe shoes, felt the performance was a
success.

"The woman inside me has finally had the |) > Jigaly set

said. "I represent women and their role as thé op-
pressed insignificant other, tightly bound by society's
tutu."

Blaine Dixon, sporting an oh-so stylish
umbrella, agrees with Browning.

"It was great fun," said Dixon, "and Butch
will make a great FD date."

According to Dixon, he represents the hope
of a future free from racial and sexual tension getting
shafted by the oppresive white male of contemporary
society. "It's deep," Dixon said. "It really is."

Paul Tsmith, says the oppresive male char-
acter he portrays is the complete antithesis of what a
truly sensitive guy he is. "I am a sensitive kind of
guy," Tsmith said. "I really am."

Members of the audience also believed the
performance to be a success.

"It was great," one student said. "It was
better than Cats."

Homer vacations with
YOUR tax money

After more than 12 months of
saying that he had nothing to do with
the car tax, Lexington Mayor HE.
“Homer” Derrick admitted Wednes-
day that the tax has paid for his re-
peated trips to the Bahamas.

“Look, my trips to the Baha-
mas are my own business,” Homer
said. “Just because the city collects
money from students and then pays for
meto have alittle fun in the sun doesn’t
mean that the two are connected.

“The trips have nothing to do
with W&L or the car tax,” Homer said.
“Bryan Shaw [W&L’s public relations
man, who is not a SPE] is right, tying
the car tax to anything is bullshit.”

Homer, who is not a SPE,
rejected the idea that a flat tax on all
cars, regardless of their value, is fair.
He said that the 4.25 percent tax rate is
needed to cover the increased road and
sidewalk maintenance costs that ex-
pensive cars incur.

“The more expensive the car,
the more damage it does to the road,”
Homer said. “Look, kids with more
expensive cars are richer. Richer kids
have less regard for nature. And Kids
with less regard for nature litter more.
Therefore, expensive cars damage
roads more than cheap cars.”

Besides, if those W&L
babies don’t like it,
they can just vote me out
of office next time!

— Homer

 

 

Additionally, Homer said, the
tax is justified by the income hehas lost
at the College Town Shop, which Mrs.
Homer runs.

“Ever since the Phi printed
my phone number, students have
stopped coming into the little woman’s
store,” Homer said. “I figure the bas-
tards owe me.

“Besides, if those W&L ba-
bies don’t like it, they can just vote me

out of office next time,” the mayor
said.

Homer said that students sim-
ply must register to vote with the city
registrar, Lucille “I am the Law” Joyce.

The registrar, the mother of
Assistant Commonwealth’s Attorney
Robert Joyce Jr., said students are wel-
come to try to register.

“I dare them to come down
and try it,” the Law said. “When stu-
dents grow up and get out in the real
world, then they can vote.”

While students do have
certain rights, Joyce said, voting is not
necessarily one of them.

“Here in Lexington, no one
votes unless I say so,” the Law said,
“and I don’t like students --- or their
fancy cars.

“If anyone has a problem with
that they can file a lawsuit. What, is my
son gonna prosecute me?”

On perhaps the only bright
side of this whole issue, Homer did get
a serious sunburn on the top of his bald
head during his last trip to the bahamas

In a strange turn of events, the
1992 Summer Olympic Games will
be held at Washington and Lee
University in Lexington, Va., U.S.A.
rather than in Barcelona, Spain, as
originally planned.

Olympic officials said that Spain
funded its bid to host the Games with
drug money and elected to move the
games. Although W&L did not make
a bid, they were awarded the games
for free because of its history of
honor.

“*For nearly a month, W&L will
become the focal point of the world,”’

said University President John
Wilson. ‘‘That can do nothing but
bolster the University’s already

perfect image. And we're getting it
for free.”’

Olympic officials said that despite
the small size of both Lexington and
W&L, ‘‘the games must go on. We’re
positive that W&L will prove to be
both an adequate and an outstanding
host to the countries of the world.”’

The Games will be held begin
July 26 and end August 15.

There had been some question as
to W&L’s ability to run the Games
smoothly because of its size and the
lack of a large city in the immediate

Washington and Lee coaches
must now be wary of the way they
treat players or even the way they
criticize their performances.

The Confidential Review
Committee released an amendment to
their conduct code recommendation,
calling for coaches to be put under its
umbrella of influence. The
amendment states that coaches may
no longer ‘‘single out, punish or
demean players because of their
physical or mental shortcomings on

W&L to host Summer Games

vicinity.

“‘That’s bullshit,’ said W&L
spokesman Brian Shaw. ‘‘There are
two cities within an hour that are
more than capable of handling the
consumer rush the Olympic Games
will bring. And as far as the athletics
goes, we have more than enough
fields, stadiums and gymnasiums. We
have no doubts that the Games will
go smoothly.’’

Staunton, to the north, and
Roanoke, to the south, will be the
primary distribution points for Olym-
pic merchandise. There will also be
stores in downtown Lexington.

“We see this as a great oppor-
tunity to put a lot of money we had-
n’t counted on into the economy,”’
said Lexington mayor H. E. ‘‘Buddy’”’
Derrick.

The opening ceremony will be
held July 26. For its final leg, the
Olympic torch will be run from Fair-
field down U.S. route 11, past the
Lee-Hi Truck Stop and Restaurant —
caterers to the Olympic Games — into
town, past VMI, across the foot-
bridge and onto Wilson Field, where
the teams will enter.

W&L history professor Taylor
Sanders will carry the torch on its
final leg.

“This is a fine opportunity,’
Sanders. *‘

’ said
Just as the Greeks consider

it an honor, I do as well.’’

To honor the ancient olympians,
Sanders will jog the final leg naked,
as the Greeks did.

The venues for the sporting
events will be spread out across cam-
pus. The track and field events will
take place on Wilson Field and the
football practice field. The basketball
competition will take place in the
Warner Center. The gymnastics com-
petition will take place in the Dor-
emus Gym, adjacent to the 2,500 seat
Warner Center.

Soccer will be held on the Liberty
Hall Field, and baseball will be
played at Smith Field. Swimming and
water polo will be held in the Cy
Twombly Pool, and the weightlifting
competition will be held in the War-
ner Center weight room. Tennis will
be played on the Varsity Courts.

Boxing and wrestling will be held
at the Pavilion.

“*The athletic facilities will be in
tip-top shape,’’ said W&L Athletic
Director Mike Walsh. ‘‘They are
some of the finest fields in America,
and we are proud and ready for the
world to take to them.”’

American athletes didn’t seem
concerned with the lack of size of the
arenas.

“*T’ve never played in a gym with

less than 10,000 seats,’’ said

basketball player Michael Jordan. ‘‘I
think it will be neat. Plus, they have
a McDonald’s so I’ll be able to do
some endorsements. Don’t they?’’

Swimmers expressed some
concern about W&L’s shorter-than
Olympic length Twombly Pool
(capacity 500). The pool is 25 yards
long and only 12 feet deep. Standard
olympic pools are 50 meters by 15
feet.

“I’ve never had to do a flip-turn °

in the 50-meters,’’ said Matt Biondi,
who stands six feet, seven inches. ‘‘It
should be really interesting, also.”’

Walsh insisted that the facilities
would pose no problems for the
athletes.

“They are the world’s greatest
athletes, excepting of course the
athletes of Major League baseball,”’
he said. ‘“‘They should be able to
adjust to their surroundings without
complaining.”’

The Olympic Village for athletes
will be comprised of W&L’s student
housing facilities. Athletes will reside
in the four dormitories, Gaines Hall,
Woods Creek and the dormitories in
the lower levels of the Warner
Center.

“‘As always, the women will
reside on the third floor of the fresh-
men dorms,’ said W&L_ security
officer Baner. ‘‘Even though the

students aren’t here, we can’t have
any trouble now — buddy.”’

The University, however, will not
open the newly renovated fraternity
houses to the Olympic athletes.

““We have spent too much time
and effort renovating them,’’ said
Wilson. ‘‘We can’t run the risk of
these strangers to our community
coming in and doing damage to
them.”’

The Olympic committee spoke
with W&L about using some of
VMI’s athletic facilities, but decided
not to press the ‘issue when both
Wilson and Walsh said W&L’s
facilities were more than sufficient.

‘Really, we saw no need to bring
VMI into this,”’ said Wilson.

“This is our project and we are

more than capable of handling it,’’
said Walsh. ‘‘We have worked long
and hard and we don’t need to give
VMI some free notoriety after all our
hard work.”’

Despite the unexpected and untold
amounts of money that the Games
should bring into the city, Derrick
said he would not consider changing
any of the city’s tax structures, most
notably the taxing of W&L student
automobiles.

““We’ve gone around and around
about this in Council,’’ said Derrick.
“The bottom line is, that no matter
how much money we make from the
Olympics being here — and it is sure
to be a lot — the students will return
after the Games. And if they have
cars, then they’ll have a tax.”’

reign; W&L coaches join the growing list of CRC victims

the playing field.”’

According to the CRC, this
amendment will secure a player
against the obvious abuses of any
athletic coach.

‘‘What are ‘shortcomings’?
This is going to cause major
problems for us,”’ said one coach.

This doesn’t bode well for
W&L coaches trying to discipline
their players and get them ready for a
season. This amendment will produce
repercussions on every team at W&L.

Head football coach Gary
Fallon can no_ longer criticize
offensive linemen for missing blocks

| Harris Teeter

which result in the massacring of the
quarterback.

Head basketball coach Verne
Canfield can no longer make a player
run extra suicides for refusing to play
because an opposing player said he
needed to use deodorant before
games.

Men’s swimming coach Page
Remillard can no longer make a
swimmer swim extra laps for deciding
during a race to take a break and
walk the rest of the way.

Women’s lacrosse coach Jan
Hathom can no longer bench a player
for refusing to remove her pink

 

spandex and replace them with the
regulation black ones.

Head soccer coach Rolf
Piranian can no longer bench a player
for scoring a goal in his own net
because he was mad at the keeper for
stealing his date at a frat party.

Head baseball coach Jeff
Stickley can no longer yell at a player
for missing a fly ball because he was
checking out the girls lacrosse team
practicing on Liberty Field.

Women’s tennis coach Cinda
Rankin can no longer make a player
Tun extra sprints for smashing tennis
balls over the fence because she

wants to protest the lack of a
women’s mud wrestling team.

I could go on, but I think you
get my drift. This new amendment is
a travesty. f

“It will probably cause total
anarchy for a while,’ said one
anonimous CRC representative, ‘“but
after some time, the coaches will get
used to the change.”’

An even bigger travesty is the
fact this amendment doesn’t include
some of the professors who level
students with unnecessary
punishments, such as grades.

A woman who says she

cision to take steroids was wrong.

“Men justdon’tunderstand

doesn’t matter if you’re four-foot-

you’re hung like a bull.”

So why did he take the
plunge into drugs? CRC Chairman
Joan Shaughnessy, a self-proclaimed
.experton the male psyche, said Bud-
dy’s problem was self-esteem.

“Like most vertically chal-
lenged men, Buddy did not think he

Senior dorm
counselor Nancy Noname
and Ring-tum Phi yellow
sensationalist Molly
Muckraker disemboweled
each other yesterday in
front of the Co-op, to the
horror of 25 students who
witnessed the event.

Witnesses said
Muckraker, 20, was
emerging from Reid Hall at
the same moment Noname,
21, left the C-School.

They spotted each
other across the expanse of
juniper bushes and the
battle was on.

Muckraker, who
was carrying a 3-foot brass
anchor used for the annual
‘Revive Delta Gamma”
benefit, struck first, blud-
geoning Noname_ and
wounding her severely.

Noname produced a
sword she said had been
given to her by a former
Marine, with whom she
denied sleeping.

Noname drove the
sword into Muckraker,

penetrating her and
partially disembowel-
ing her.

From there, the
battle raged on as the wom-
en, interlocked in a bloody
tangle, circled the C-School
seven times, leaving a trail
of intestines.

Politics Professor
Lewis John, who happened
to be looking out his office

during the encounter said
he saw nothing.

MacFarland said. ‘‘This

incident was not an asset to

Noname finally got
the upper hand in the bat-
tle when she caught Muck-
raker around the neck and
smashed her brains out
against the ODK benches.

Victorious, Noname
attempted to drag Muck-
raker’s body off to show
the girls on her hall in
Gilliam Dormitory. How-
ever, Noname got only as
far as the steps to the Co-
op before she died from her
wounds.

Student Conduct
Committee President Chris
Haley said the incident was
a ‘personal dispute’’ be-
tween the two women and
that the SCC would not get
involved.

Will she croak? Bagenris

 

By DASTARDLY DAMIEN
Phi Evil Doer

Mrs. Betty Bucks, donator
of fine pottery, spiked a 102 degree
fever and was admitted to the hospital
yesterday,

Bucks, whose life has lin-
gered longer than university officials
expected, is supposed to croak this
time, according to her doctor Elmer
“Buddy” Fudd.

“She’s old,” said Dr. Fudd.
“Old folks don’t fight off fevers too
well. This is it.”

According to Fudd it’s dif-
ficult to nail down just how much
longer Bucks will continue to breath.

“Tt could be an hour, or it
could be a week, but it can’t be too
long ‘cause we need the extra beds,”
Fudd said.

When told about Bucks’
recenthealth scare, W&L’s greatcom-
municator Brian Shaw said “No shit!”

“The university has been
looking forward to the day we would
get all the Bucks stuff with bated
breath,” said Shaw. “I’m so thrilled I
could weep.”

President John D. Wilson
also expressed positive feelings to-
wards Bucks fastapproaching doom.

“AssoonasI heard, I called
dining services and had them put 80
cases of champagne on ice,” Wilson
said. “As soon as the old girl drops
dead I’m popping the first cork.

Wilson asserted that the
champagne would be for everyone
who has supported the plans for the
Bucks estate.

“You think I’m going to
share the champagne with all you
scum who opposed my plans for the
estate? No way,” Wilson said. “Buy
your own damn champagne, this is
my party and I'll invite who I want
to.”

Wilson did pause a mo-
ment in his reverie to ponder how
Bucks was holding up emotionally
during the final ticks of her biological
clock.

“The reaper will be knock-
ing at Bucks’ door any day now, I
wonder if she’s scared,” Wilson asked.
“Aww, what does it matter, I bet she
thinks her old man’ll be waiting for
her on the other-side anyway.”

Both Shaw and Wilson
agree that Bucks’ donation will do
good things for W&L’s reputation.

“U.S. News and World
Reports can’t ignore us now,” Shaw
said.

Wilson seems to think that

Bucks’ death will raise even more
money for W&L than she has do-
nated.

“After she agreed to give
us all her stuff, the faculty and admin-
istrators took out a betting pool for
the day she would die,” he said. “No
one placed bets for the next three
days, so if she goes soon W&L gets
the money, and it’s a fair sum of
dough.”

One professor seems to
think she has a good chance at win-
ning the money. French Professor
Kathy Jo Koberstein put money on
everyday of next week.

“Tjusthad this really strong
feeling,” Koberstein said. “I’m sure if
Mrs. Bucks knew a woman had a
chance of winning a lot of money if
she would just live a few more days,
she would hang on.”

Koberstein, however does
not know where she stands with Wil-
son.

“T was against this whole
Bucks Estate Plan in the beginning,
but the trustees made me see the light,
and then again I didn’t really have a
choice,” she said. “I just hope Pres.
Wilson knows I’m all for itnow, and
lets me have some of that champagne
I’ve been hearing about. I’m sure it’s
better than that stuff they serve at the
moose lodge.”

W&L NAILED WITH VEGAS VIOLATIONS!

 

By RICHARD F. PERRY
Phi Las Vegas Gambler

 

A Nevada grand jury
today indicted the Washington
and Lee athletic department in
connection with numerous NCAA
violations at U.N.L.V.

“‘T said all along that we
ran a clean program and that the
NCAA was out to get us,’’ said
relieved and reinstated U.N.L.V.
basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian.
“Now maybe the NCAA will get

off my back and let me get back
to coaching these fine people.’’

W&L president John
Wilson was shocked at the news
of the indictment, but kept his
composure about the matter.

‘This is a delicate mat-
ter,’” he said, ‘‘and I’d rather not
talk about it until I get in touch
with our lawyers.”’

The NCAA has yet to
state what action it will take
against the tiny Division III
school, since the normal penalty

includes limiting of scholarships
and W&L doesn’t give scholar-
ships.

W&L head basketball
coach Verne Canfield denied that
he had anything to do with sabo-
taging UNLV.

“Why on earth would I
want to do that?’’ he said. ‘‘It’s
been years since I had my heart
set on getting a Division I job.’’

W&L Athletic Director
Mike Walsh, who is in just his
third year at the helm, denied

can add up quickly.

What else makes SRAs
so special? A broad range
of allocation choices, from
the safety of TIAA to the
investment accounts of
CREF'’s variable annuity;

 

 

knowledge of the charges.

“I think, if all this actu-
ally happened, that my predeces-
sor had to be behind it,’’ he said.
“I’m not saying anything hap-
pened, but I want to stress that it
didn’t happen before I got here.’’

Former W&L basketball
player Mike Holton said the
NCAA is behind tis new charge.

“There is no way that
anyone from around W&L set up
any of the Vegas violations,”’ he
said. ‘‘I think that one of the

At. 5, Box 379

Vegas players won the jackpot at
Caesars or some place like that,
and then paid the courts to drop
the charges against them and
come after us.”

Canfield agreed with his
former player on passing the
blame.

“The NCAA has to be
in on it also,’’ he said. ‘“They
must have said, ‘hey, let’s go
after a small, academically proud
school with a tradition of honor
and really screw with it!’’’’

Infirmary scraps
AIDS teaching

Students just don't need it

By Lone D. SILVER
Phi Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee Infir-
mary has scrapped all plans to educate
students about AIDS, because everyone
knows that those kinds of things just
don’t happen here.

“I confess that, when AIDS hys-
teria first came about, I was a bit ner-
vous,” said Dr. Jane Horton of the Infir-
mary. “Now, I realize W&L is too good to
allow that kind of low-class disease. Why,
if the virus were to attack someone here,
it would just be thrown right out of the
body.”

Horton attributes this incredible
ability to repel the HIV-virus to a rare
antibody known as amazingus
arrogantus. It is believed that the anti-
body is passed on to freshmen when they
go through matriculation in September.

“For some reason, God has
blesses these wonderful students with the
superhuman power to defy all the laws of
nature,” Horton said.

Horton said that she was con-
tinuing herresearch, and that itis possible
that W&L students are also immune from
other common problems as well.

“It’s possible that this is the be-
ginning of some sort of master race. You
lucky men and women may never have to
face such ailments as heart disease, male
pattern baldness or the heartbreak of pso-
riasis,” Horton said. “Wouldn’t that be
wonderful?”

Jury lies, says EC member stole

 

By H.V. TRULY
Phi Staff Reporter

A member of the Executive
Committee was convicted Friday of break-
ing and entering and grand larceny, but
since all W&L students are honest, moral
people, it’s obvious the Rockbridge
County Circuit Court jury was wrong.

The sophomore EC member was

sentenced to one year in the state peniten-

tiary, but is eligible for parole in early
August. The Phi is withholding his name
in case he wants to run for EC again after
his release.

The sophomore denied that his
conviction would affect his ability to judge
honor trials in the future.

“T just don’t think it’s relevant,”
he said. “In fact, it’s none of anyone’s
business. How dare the Phi go snooping
in public records like this!”

The jury found the EC member
guilty of breaking into another W&L
student’s room and stealing a television
and stereo. The victim, a junior, refused
to comment on the crime.

“T really don’t want anyone to
know that I am a crime victim,” said the
junior. “I mean, what would people think
if they knew my life wasn’t perfect? It

As a result of a generous
promise of a $10 donation from the
conglomeration Pepsico, Washington and
Lee officials say they will slightly
restructure Lee Chapel to honor the gift.

A Pepsico spokesman presented
a giant, mock check, along with a bucket
of Hot Wings, to highly esteemed W&L
President John D. Wilson, at one of the
scheduled global Capital Campaign

 

stops.

Wilson said Pepsico hinted
there might be more where that came
from, but they didn’t specify whether
they meant money or Hot Wings.

“‘Regardless, we’ve decided to
move the clock on top of Lee Chapel
and replace it with that jaunty red and
white Kentucky Fried Chicken roof.”’

Wilson said the gift actually
stems from a forgotten clause in the will

Students

virgins,

new survey says

 

By U.B. KIDDING
Phi Staff Reporter

 

A very bored Dean of
Student Sexuality and other
Moral Dangers Mrs. Larry La-
mont announced today that a
new survey on student sexuality
revealed that all W&L students
are virgins saving themselves for
their marriage night.

““My hard work all
these years has finally paid off,”’
said Mrs. Lamont. ‘‘Students
have seen the light and are ab-
staining.”’

Mrs. Lamont said most
students said they hardly ever
think about sex, never watch or
read pomography, and report
living very fulfilled lives.

Lamont also said, how-
ever, that 20 percent of the stu-
dents said they had kissed some-
one on the first date and a hand-
ful said they had seen a member

of the opposite sex in the nude.

‘“‘Hopefully these few
students will understand the
danger of being tempted into the
pit of carnal desires, a life of
hellfire and sexually-transmitted
diseases,’’ Mrs. Lamont said. ‘‘]
just hope these at-risk students
will come in for counselling.’’

Similar surveys at area
women’s colleges show that their
students are sexually frustrated,
and that some have resorted to
travelling to Hampden-Sydney
for the one-night stands they
used to enjoy at W&L.

“‘T don’t know when the
W&L guys got so frigid, but
they just don’t want to do the
wild thing any more,”’ said Ima
Slut, who attends a Buena Vista
finishing school.

When told about the
survey results, Pretty Boy Brian
Shaw had just one comment.

“*Bullshit.”’

would ruin my reputation as a
normal W&L student.”’

The - prosecution
presented several hours of
testimony and evidence linking
the EC member to the theft, but
obviously it was all lies.

Dean of All the Perfect
Students David L. Howison
testified on behalf of the EC
member during the trial.

“T’ve known _ [this
student] since he came to W&L,
and he has always seemed to be
a fine, upstanding citizen,’’ said

Howison. ‘‘I just don’t see why
should convict him solely on
physical evidence. This is a
travesty of justice.”’

To avoid any confusion,
the Phi staff would like to make
it perfectly clear that we all
believe the EC member and have
no faith whatsoever in the
United States criminal justice
system. Students can all trust
each other and leave their doors
unlocked all day and night,
because everyone knows that
bad things just don’t happen at
W&L.

We're all on your side,

Pepsico officials hinted that

rumors make it doubly fitting
that future KFC gifts be ushered
with a change in a sacred W&L
structure like Lee Chapel.
“*Since the Colonnade is
scheduled to be bulldozed in
June to make way for the Wat-
son Mausoleum, I mean Gallery,

logical choice to take it on the

God knows, the president of
W&L can do no wrong.

“That old chapel has
needed a little ‘spicing up’ for a
long time anyway,’’ chortled
Wilson. He’s so clever.

Wilson said the chapel’s
interior might be redesigned as
well. For example, the first 100-
gallon deep fryer Sanders ever
used will be displayed in Lee’s
office, as will a shrine detailing
the evolution of KFC’s “‘Original
Recipe,”’ and a lock of Sanders’
hair.

W&L Director of Truth-
ful and Complete Information
Brian Shaw said the modification
to Lee Chapel is in no way a
kickback to Pepsico.

“Tying together the
issue of the red-and-white roof
on Lee Chapel and the Pepsico
donation is bullshit,’’ Shaw said.

But of course no stu-
dents made that connection any-
way, because nothing ever hap-
pens behind closed doors at
WAL. We all trust each other.

Shaw said the KFC lead
may have sparked a rash of Pep-
sico donations, sighting discus-
sion of a Taco Bell mezzanine in
the Lenfest Center.

““We’re just not sure
theater crowds can handle the hot
taco sauce,’’ Shaw said. ‘‘Bull-
shit.”’

A truly

By Wenpy O’Micop
Phi Woman At Large

 

Mrs. Betty Bucks, kind and generous
benefactor of the Bucks Estate and all that neat
pottery, has come down with a 102 degree
fever.

Bucks’ doctor Elmer“Buddy” Fudd
said he expects Buck to be fine in a few days.

“It’s just a fever. Don’t ya'll at that
university get fevers,” Fudd asked. “Don’t
worry, she’s not going anywhere just yet.”

Bucks condition has caused great
concern throughout the university community.

“We're quite concerned with Mrs.
Bucks health,” President John D. Wilson said.
“She’s such a fine old gal, we’re going to see
what we can do for her.”

Brain Shaw, W&L’s great commu-
nicator said every effort is being made to let
Mrs. Bucks know W&L is pulling for her.

“Several students have come to me
saying we should start a massive letter writing
campaign, and by gosh that is just what we’ve
done,” Shaw said.

According to Shaw, the first truck-

load of cards should have arrived early yester-
day morning. Mrs. Buck’s butler Buford T.
Winthrop confirmed the delivery of the get well
letters and cards.

“Oh! Mrs. Bucksis so thrilled! youre
nice Mr. Wilson sent her flowers,” Winthrop
said.

Mrs. Bucks herself telephoned this
reporter because she wanted to express her
extreme gratitude to the W&L community.

“T never thought that many strangers
could care,” she said. “I’ve decided that I need
to do something more for the kids.”

So Mrs. Bucks has decided to make
yet another donnation of the porcelin kind.

“T’ve decided to give the dining hall
my everyday dinner dishes,” Bucks said. “I
hear they are in desperate need of clean dishes
over there.”

Director of food services Gerald
Darrell is ecstatic about the donnation.

“T hear they have a lovely light blue
floral pattern on them,” Darrell said. “They
should match very well with our existing dinner
ware.”

Mrs. Bucks did assert that the

“T’ll just use my good china,” she
said.

Many students on campus are very
pleased with the new donation.

“She’s such a sweet woman,” said
student Kirsti Krunch, “I’m looking so forward
to gazing at pretty dishes while I eat.

Student Joey-Rob Doogin also had
an interesting perspective on the new dishes.

“Tt’s cool, but what happens when
we use them all? They'll be just as bad as the
rest,” Doogin said. “I guess it doesn’t matter
though, ‘cause this Bucks chick is alright.”

Student Tammy Tootin summed up
the whole issue perfectly.

“Wow, I wrote heraletter, but never
dreamed she would be this generous,” Tootin
said. “It just goes to show how fara little human
kindess will go.”

However, there was at least one stu-
dent who does not understand the meaning of
generosity and kindness.

“What do I care? I don’t eat in the
damn dining hall anyway,” said Bad Attitude

Duke’s Parks says hello W&L

By MULDOON
Phi WHO?

 

For all those fanatical
Duke fans that I know, and I
know of only one, I have some
good and bad news for you.

The good news is that
your team survived to the Sweet
Sixteen, how I will never know.

The bad news is that
Cherokee Parks will be leaving
Duke next year to attend, and
play basketball, at our humble
institution, Washington and Lee
University.

Pretty neat, ain’t it?

I know your probably

pulling your hair out over this,
but just think, you'll be able to
see him up close(not with Roy
Firestone) and personal. That’s
got to be some consolation to
you.

The reasons Parks gave
for his sudden decision was the
lack of playing time he was
receiving behind All-American
Christian Laettner.

Parks said he felt left
out by Coach K.(I’m not even
going to attempt to spell it), and
that he wanted to be a bigger part
of a team. He also said that
Laettner was the biggest ball-hog
he’d ever played with.

Despite Parks

impressive credentials, head
basketball coach Verne Canfield
says Parks may need a little time
to adjust to the Generals system.

“I’m not sure he’ll start
right away,’’ said Canfield after
he heard the news.

“Parks is a great talent,
but there are others in front of
him that know the system better.
I figure he’ll have it down by the
third or fourth second of
tryouts.”’

Two members of next
year’s team look forward to the
addition of some size underneath
