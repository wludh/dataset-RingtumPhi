In an effort to make Halloween
safer in Lexington, several
Washington and Lee students will
help Lexington children trick-or-treat
tonight.

Kappa Alpha Theta will sponsor
‘*Witch Watch’’ for the second year,
junior Jennifer Gladwell said. With
the aid of about 50 cadets from Vir-
ginia Military Institute, Theta mem-
bers will patrol Lexington streets that
children tend to visit on Halloween.

The students will help kids cross
the street and make sure older child-
ren don’t pick on the younger ones,
Gladwell said. She ‘said everyone

involved with ‘‘Witch Watch’’ will
wear reflector tape or reflector vests.

“Our program is a preventive
measure,’’ Gladwell said. ‘‘We hope
our presence on the street will keep
vandalism and harassment of little
kids to a minimum.”’

Senior Amy Beall said that mem-
bers of Chi Omega and Sigma Phi
Epsilon will escort children through
Gaines Hall and through residential
areas of Lexington as they trick-or-
treat.

Parents can bring their children to
the Fairfax Lounge in the W&L
University Center tonight between
5:00 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., she said.

“This might take the burden off
parents who don’t want to go trick-
or-treating,’’ Beall said.

 

 

 

Black fraternity visits

 

By Cathy Lopiccolo
News Editor

 

Alpha Phi Alpha, a historically
black fraternity, is aiming to re-es-
tablish a chapter on campus this
winter, a fraternity representative said.

Alpha Director for District 7 and
Virginia President Byron Bullock
called his Oct. 23 visit to Washington
and Lee ‘‘informative.”’

“It provided me an opportunity to
talk to people here about what alter-
natives were available and about the
logistics of a chapter,’’ Bullock said.
‘ W&L students interested in bring-
ing a historically black fraternity to
campus contacted Alpha in the spring,
Bullock said. W&L had an Alpha
¢hapter in the 1970s, but it folded.

Bullock spent his day meeting
with administrators, students and the
Student Affairs Committee.

Associate Dean of Students for
Greek Affairs Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’
Atkins said Bullock clarified some
issues for him.

‘ “It really had not been explained
how Alpha would mesh with our
Interfraternity Council,’’ Atkins said.
« Atkins said before an Alpha chap-
ler could colonize at W&L, SAC

must determine. if a chapter could
succeed. If SAC approves, inter-
ested students would petition the IFC
to invite Alpha onto campus.

Bullock said an Alpha chapter
would be an active member of the
existing IFC. He said Alpha’s
‘‘membership intake process’’ would
have to be approved by the IFC,
because it is slightly different from
W&L’s rush.

Alpha does not limit its member-
ship to black men, Bullock said, but
only men who have completed 12
credit hours are eligible. That means
Alpha would not accept freshmen for
membership during fall Rush.

Bullock said Alpha is most wor-
ried about the W&L chapter’s size.

‘*We would be interested in work-
ing with the chapter to make certain
it has the numbers and keeps them
up,’’ Bullock said. ‘‘It would be a
priority, since we know it may be a
problem.”’

He said other Alpha chapters have
from seven to 30 members.

Atkins said a small Alpha chapter
might not be able to pay the IFC
fees paid by other fraternities. He
said an exception coud be made for
Alpha since their programming would
be different.

Brice said his goal for the
coming year will be to ‘‘encourage
class unity.’’ He said that while he
supports the idea of freshmen join-
ing fraternities early in the year,
he would like freshmen to be able
to ‘“‘hang out with each other
sometimes."’

Stewart said he and Brice hope
to hold a freshman class mixer
‘*sometime before Christmas.’’

King said he is honored to be
able to ‘‘uphold the tradition of

“The great thing about the
Honor System is that it doesn’t put
fear in people, but instead people
respect it,’’ King said.

Trustees postpone
decision on gallery

Board asks for review of alternate sites

 

By Cathy Lopiccole
News Editor

 

Construction of the proposed Watson Gallery
will be delayed at least two months while the
Washington and Lee administration reviews
possible alternative sites for the building.

During its meeting Oct. 25-26, the W&L
Board of Trustees requested the review, partial-
ly in response to student concerns about the
building’s placement behind the Reeves Center
and the Colonnade.

“The board asked the administration to
make sure alternatives had been examined,”’
University President and Trustee John D. Wil-
son said.

Board members voted during their meetings
not to make individual statements about the
Watson Gallery and appointed Wilson as their
spokesman on the issue, W&L Communica-
tions Director Brian Shaw said.

Money to build the controversial gallery was
donated by Mrs. William Watson, the widow
of a W&L alumnus, to house her $6 to $10
million Chinese art collection.

The board had been scheduled to give its
final approval to the gallery last weekend, and
construction was tentatively scheduled to start
in December.

However, Wilson said now he must meet
with the board’s Capital Projects Committee in
late November to discuss alternative locations.
He said the building’s construction will not be
approved until the board’s next meeting in
February, and construction could not begin
before then.

Junior Richard Chapman circulated a petition
protesting the building’s location on what he
called the last natural area on the Colonnade.

He said he was pleased with the board’s deci-
sion.

‘In a perfect scenario, it would have been
great if they had just said, no, we definitely
won't build it here,’ Chapman said. ‘‘At least
they did go back to square one.”’

; icant Chapman met with
the Capital Projects
Committee chairman,
Beverly DuBose, dur-
ing the board’s meet-
ing, and spoke to him
once over the phone.
Chapman said DuBose
im explained the problems
involved with trying to
‘jchange the location of
the gallery.
Chapman said he
was told the trustees’
main concern is that
Wilson the Watson Gallery
and the Reeves Center stay together. If the
Watson Gallery is built in another location, the
university may have to spend its own money to
move the Reeves Center also.

In addition, Chapman said the trustees want
to place the gallery in a place where it will be
used by students.

Wilson said the board was pleased with the
architectural design for the building.

‘One trustee observed, in his time here, it
is the most exquisite architectural concept he’d
had a chance to see,’’ Wilson said.

In other business, the board discussed the
recent incidents of rape and sexual assault on
or near campus, but did not take any formal
action, Wilson said. He said the board is en-
couraged that W&L students have begun trying
to protect each other.

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

NEw Houses,
NEw RULES

No one ever said it would be perfect,
and at the midpoint of the Fraternity
Renaissance Program, that’s what mem-
bers of the renovated fraternity houses

have realized.

While most fraternity men concede that their houses look
better, they claim university rules hinder their ability to enjoy

themselves.

“The fraternity system at
W&L has changed from one
with almost no constraints to
one with the university par-

enting us,’’ Phi Kappa Sigma President Marc Short said.

The renaissance program, which began with Sigma Alpha
Epsilon in April 1990, has renovated eight of the 14 participat-
ing houses. The other finished houses include Sigma Nu, Phi
Delta Theta, Pi Kappa Alpha, Phi Kappa Sigma, Beta Theta Pi,
Lambda Chi Alpha, and Kappa Sigma.

Washington and Lee has spent about $7.6 million on the first
eight houses, Coordinator of Capital Planning Frank Parsons
said. He said the university expects the entire program to cost

about $13.1 million.

Despite the investment of time and money, several other
fraternity men agreed with Short’s assessment.

Sophomore Alex Cruikshank, a
member of Phi Delta Theta, said the
main drawback to living in the new
house is the complex system of rules
and regulations governing behavior in
and upkeep of the renovated houses.

‘And it’s probably not as much
fun as living in the old house,”’
Cruiskshank said.

Sigma Nu sophomore Jason Aiken
complained about university regula-
tions as well.

‘The way the university is crack-
ing down on fraternity behavior in
the new house is a real pain in the
butt,’’ Aiken said.

Campus in crisis:
ideas for us all

Three weeks have passed since the latest incident
of sexual violence at Washington and Lee, and in
many minds the shock has passed. For those
students involved in this and other recent, similar
incidents, things will not soon be forgotten, but for
the rest of us, these events are beginning to fade.

We, as a staff, have learned a number of things
from our close attention to these events. Through our
discussions with police, victims, the accused,
administrators and student leaders, we have seen
things from a number of viewpoints. We thought it
an appropriate closing to our three-part editorial to
Share some of the things we have learned.

There are the obvious warnings that we have all
heard time and time again; they deserve repetition:

We all need to have the common sense to lock our
doors at night. No one, especially a woman, should
walk around after dark alone, particularly while
drunk. You need to figure out how you’re going to
get home from a party before you go, and stick to
the plan. Never hesitate to call W&L Security or the
Lexington Police if you have been attacked or feel
threatened.

The most important point of all, and ironically the
one everyone already knows, is that abuse of alcohol
makes everyone more vulnerable.

From the woman who sends unclear signals about
what she is willing to do sexually, to the man who
can’t tell what she wants, everyone’s judgement is
hampered by overuse of alcohol. That is not to say
that women always send unclear signals, but it does
happen. Alcohol abuse is not something many people
want to address at W&L, but students should at least
recognize that it is the root cause of many other
serious problems.

For three weeks now, we have labeled this
university a campus in crisis. We know it’s hard to
believe there is a real crisis while classes go on as
usual for most everyone. But for a few of our
classmates, the past months have been traumatic
times that have changed their lives forever. For them,
it has been a crisis. Our. goal in our coverage of
these events and in our editorials has been to bring to
everyone’s attention that bad things do happen to
people in our usually honorable community. We hope
students have gained enough awareness to protect
themselves and each other in the future.

That said, we still believe that W&L is a special
place. We have seen some terrible things happen, but
we can be proud of the fact that ours is a relatively
safe, caring, honorable community where no one has
to endure their pain alone. That’s more than most
colleges can say.

No, things won’t be perfect here in the future.
They’ve never been that way. But if we know what
to expect, we'll be better prepared to avoid or deal

with the dangers.

As a community, we should move on and enjoy
our time here. We should not forget the lessons we
have learned.

Ever notice how there’s always that one person
in your class? You know who I’m talking about:
the guy (or girl, but I’ll stick with the generic guy;
feminists, too bad, read another column) that
always has his four pencils sharpened to a dagger
point, the guy that always reads ahead, the guy
that always has his hand up in class to answer the
most impossible of questions. Yes, we’re talking
about the Sycophant Student. No, he isn’t a sick
elephant; for all you non-English majors out there,
“*sycophant’’ means ‘‘bootlicker.’’ (I know, maybe
a few dim souls outside of Payne Hall know the
word, but I’m feeling superior today, even though
the Braves lost the World Series last night; but
how many teams get to boast of a 14-5 victory?
Steve Avery is God, amen.)

Thinking about types of students got me
wondering about every single person in my classes.
The English Department is nothing if not widely
varied in its students (joined by the occasional C-
school major who realizes he needs a lit
requirement to graduate; you recognize them
straight-off by their need to spout off flow charts
and supply-demand curves — the 20 pound Econ
textbook is a good signal, too. I confess, I took
two courses in the C-school, but only after severe
financial prodding by my father, the banker). So, .
let’s check out the typical W&L classroom (get out
your pens and turn to page 1 of Swann’s
Dichotomy of a Classroom). NOTE: I would

describe all of my professors, but supposedly one
of them took offense at a quotation about Paradise
Lost in last week’s column, so in order to preserve

Prof. demands
return of scanner

To the Editor:

Perhaps this will add a bit to the on-going
discussion of security, honor, crime, and some-
times punishment that has marked the beginning
of this school year.

As part of the equipping of a new electronic
news laboratory in Reid Hall, a new Uniden
public service radio scanner was installed. Just
sitting. on a desk, happily squawking out police,
fire, first aid, and, yes, even W&L security radio
messages, the little fellow called attention to
himself. After about a month on duty he disap-
peared, Stolen? Probably. By whom? Someone
knows.

Has someone suddenly shown up with a
Uniden Bearcat model BC-147XL radio scanner?
Here's a small opportunity to test our system of
trust. Maybe make a statement that things aren’t
as troubling as they have seemed lately. Are
they?

Recruitment chair
criticizes the Phi

To the Editor:

On behalf of the Admissions Office and the
Student Recruitment Committee, I would like to
respond to last week’s editorial. I believe the
editorial concerning the SRC was not only
misleading, but bordered on an outright lie.

First of all, I would like to clarify the SRC’s
purpose. The committee members are chosen for
their enthusiasm and love for Washington and
Lee. They tell prospective students about their
own experiences at W&L. Consequently, mem-
bers do not pull stories out of the blue and tell
them through ‘‘rose-colored glasses;’’ they simply
reiterate their own experiences at W&L.

As for the inaccurate quoting of Mrs. Kozak,
I would like to mention that the editor left off
part of what she told him in the interview.
Although Mrs. Kozak did say that the SRC
would not have another formal meeting until
January, she also said that she was spreading the
word through the committee’s chairmen that
members should not give the impression that
W&L is a ‘‘safe haven.’’ Letters have already
been sent out informing members of her mes-
sage.

Finally, I would like to add that the SRC also
tells prospective students about the superiority of
Washington and Lee’s journalism department.
One would hope that the school newspaper would
reflect the strength of Reid Hall; however, unsub-
stantiated editorials and bad interviewing techni-

 

  

whatever grade I may have left in his classes, I'll
hold off on that. Until next week.

The Sycophant — mentioned above. Usually
either somebody with an irritating voice who
babbles constantly, or, more rarely, a person of
lower intelligence attempting to ingratiate himself
with the teacher. Easily spotted by their arm
shooting up in the air before a professor’s question
is finished. Most teachers recognize these students
and use them for great amusement.

The Wit — this is usually the person who
forgot to do their homework and gets by with
making the teacher and the class laugh for five
minutes. Always engaged in a battle of words with
the professor, who either ignores the Wit or, more
fun, rolls up his sleeves and joins in a verbal
barrage and test of male ego to the delight of the
other people who didn’t do their homework either.
Almost never a girl; they all do their homework
anyway and get by with one or two caustic lines
to the teacher each semester.

The Individual — this is the guy who stands
out in a crowd, usually by what they’re wearing.
I know one who wears typical W&L attire: button-
down shirt, Duck Heads, and a baseball cap over
unwashed hair. Then he puts on bright green shoes.
Diverts the teacher’s attention long enough for you
to speed-read the assignment. Usually the most
interesting person in the class.

The Cynic — there’s always one of these, never
agreeing with the teacher’s reading of a poem or
translation of a line of French prose. Usually fills
the gap, of silence after a teacher's explanation of
a passage with ‘‘I don’t think he means that at
all.”’ Initially funny, eventually tiring because they
never seem to believe in anything whatsoever.

The Brooder — this is the Marlboro-smoking,
squinty-eye-looking, depressed- or bitter-sounding

LETTERS

ques certainly do not exemplify this. I suggest
that, in the future, the editor quotes people more
carefully so that Student Recruitment members
are not portraying W&L’s journalism department
‘‘through rose-colored glasses.”’

 

Sincerely,
Heather M. Midkiff
Student Recruitment Chairman

Problems call for
renewal of spirit

To the Editor:

The recent events of rape, theft, and general
craziness at Washington and Lee have left all of
us shocked. The Phi has labeled us a ‘‘Campus
in Crisis.’ Have you sensed, as I have, a great
sadness gripping the student body the past few
weeks? Why do we feel so confused and empty
at a place that has been so warm, friendly, and
secure for us? We sometimes feel so helpless in
solving our problems. With all the rapid changes
happening at W&L, we question whether the
sadness and coldness can be removed. Can we
reverse the bad trends and revive the honored
traditions?

As discouraged as I was reading Chris Sw-
ann’s article entitled ‘‘Religious Fundamentalism
and the Braves’’ in last week's Phi, I will say
that what W&L needs was answered, although
awkwardly and unintentionally, by his article. As
a Christian, I was disheartened by the main
points that Chris made. But there are two state-
ments that he made which I feel hold the key to
renewing the real W&L.

Chris made the point that ‘‘even Christ gets
mad and knocks down all the merchant stands in
the temple.’’ This story, found in John 2, tells
how Jesus found people selling animals and
exchanging money in the temple. Jesus showed
human anger as he demanded, ‘‘How dare you
turn my Father’s house into a market!’’ I feel the
same kind of anger as I look at my school.
‘‘How dare you tum my beloved campus into a
regular old college!’’ There are people, students,
and faculty who are selling out our university
and, just as Jesus got mad, I think we should be.
Each of us has a responsibility to uphold the
traditions and honor that brought us here.

The second statement that Chris made con-
taining real power came near the end of his
essay. After questioning the source of hope in
life, Chris says, ‘‘I think Jesus Christ is the
greatest person ever to exist.’’ Chris, thank you
for pointing out the real hope and meaning of
life and the best source of renewal for our
campus. God really is awesome, and He can do
great things on our campus ‘if we let him.

 
  

individual at the very back of the room. Never,
speaks and looks either downright pissed-off at the’
world or very melancholy. You either want to puti
your arm around this person and reassure them that.
the sun won’t implode for another five billion’
years, or sit five aisles away and hope they never,
look at you with that New Yorker stare.

The Popular One — typically Mr. or Mrs.'
W&L. Their hair is perfectly combed, teeth,
straight, dress impeccable, and they’re surrounded
by a number of other students, like lesser satellites!
around a gas giant. They always have their,
homework done and, while not the brightest one in’
the class, they can always say something. You end,
up wanting for this person to either include you in
his or her entourage or hope they die because they’
make you want to vomit. Sometimes, however,
they’re the nicest and most sincere people in m
class,

The Genius — here’s the one that iow
everything, studies five hours a night in between
filling out Rhodes Scholarship applications and
writing an honors thesis. Usually friendly but in a
big hurry to do their next thing —  type- A
personality in a big way. Sometimes can be one off
the above models (see Brooder, Individual, or even
Cynic). At times very superior, sometimes very’
nice, but always looking for something else oni
which to flex their synapses.

The Perfect Student — does homework all the
time, but not so much as to appear sycophanticy
Friendly to all students, regardless of category.
Likes. to. hassle the teacher once in a while, but
never insulting him or her openly (funny at times
but eventually degrading and in bad taste). Goes to
the Palms on occasion after writing a term paper:
Doesn’t exist anywhere near Lexington, at least in
my experience.

Would you say that our campus was moving
in a good direction when Robert E. Lee was
president of the college? When Lee became
president he made the following statement: ‘‘I
dread the thought of any student going away
from the college without becoming a sincere
Christian.’ Lee made clear that the spiritual
renewal and growth of the student body was
“the leading object that brought me here.’
[General Robert E. Lee After Appomattox, p.
193]. Lee did not force students to go to daily
devotions in the chapel of conform to Chris-
tianity. Yet, students were influenced and in-
spired by his character and faith.

It’s 1991, and I am further saddened because
I just finished watching the Braves lose the
World Series to the Minnesota Hankies. The
Braves lost, but W&L doesn’t have to. I believe
that today our campus is spiritually dry and is
crying our for renewal. The renewal calls for a
return to faith and trust in God. Won’t you give
God a chance to move our campus in the best
direction? Chris, I couldn’t have said it better:
‘Christ is the greatest.’’

Sincerely,
Nathan Dunn, ’94

Exchange student
Clarifies quotes.

To the Editor:

In a somewhat belated response to your recent
article about me, let me first say that its author, |
Brian McClung, fastidiously quoted me verbatim. |
Thus, the misunderstandings contained below
arise only from unintentional misinterpretation '
and from my sloppy use of the English language |
during our interview.

First, while the women at W&L are indeed |
‘tabsolutely gorgeous,’’ they are not what I like
best about the university. Call me old-fashioned
if you want, but intellectual inquiry just sneaks |
in.

Second, I do not think that all Americans tend
to act, look, and dress the same: however, | {
believe this can be said for most W&L students
(Duck Head is presumably laughing all the way
to the bank).

Please also note for the record that my room-
mate was not au naturel when I disturbed him
‘‘at play’’ with his girlfriend. He had, of course, |
the requisite good taste and sense of decorum to
wear a robe when he came to the door.

Yours etc.,

Counselors teach
alcohol awareness

By Maureen Levey
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee peer coun-
selors are expanding their roles from
hotline operators to alcohol awareness
educators.

Under the guidance of University
Counselor of Psychology Dr. James
W. Worth, the peer counselors are
promoting an outreach program in the
W&L dormitory halls on the effects
of irresponsible drinking.

“The outreach program is for
students to promote greater awareness
of the effects of alcohol and one’s
own values,’’ Worth said. ‘‘We want
to get more people talking about it.’’

Six groups of three students will
tour the dormitory halls with a twen-
ty minute video and follow with a
discussion period. The group is com-
prised of peer counselors

accompanied by a few Health
Education Committee members wha
will provide interested students with
health awareness information.

Head Peer Counselor Roger Sul-
livan, a senior, stresses ‘the
educational aspect of the program.

‘‘We’re = going to emphasize
responsible drinking because we all
realize that alcohol is an aspect of
the W&L social life,’’ Sullivan said.

‘*We are not here to tell people
what they can and cannot do, or
should and should not do with al-
cohol,’’ Worth said.

Associate Dean of Students Anne
Schroer-Lamont said she hopes
student leaders, especially those in
fraternities and sororities, will ask the
peer counselors to speak to their
organizations.

‘‘The best programs are the ones
developed by students,’’ Schroer-
Lamont said.

 

Two local youths were accused of shoplifting from the Ee
Washington and Lee Bookstore Tuesday, Lexington Police

Chief Bruce Beard said.

The juveniles, ages 14 and 15, walked out of the >
bookstore about 11 a.m. with three cassette tapes worth

about $30 in their jackets, Beard said.

Thomas A. ‘‘Baner’’ Bane, university traffic control };
officer, said he noticed the youths after they walked out |,
of the Alumni House and headed for the bookstore. Bane
said he and Director of Security Michael L. Young
followed them out of the bookstore to outside Lee

Chapel, where one boy dropped a tape.

The two have been charged with petty larceny, Beard

said.

Young said many items have been stolen on campus
this year. The school’s trusting nature,

an easy target for local thieves.

‘Everybody just assumes that everybody else will act
honorably,’ Young said. ‘‘Everyone in town does not

abide by an honor code.

SAB checks in
$9,000 ahead

 

By Greg Patterson

The Student Activities Board is
running $9,000 under budget so far
this year, according to a report given
to the Executive Committee Monday.

SAB Treasurer Susan Wootton told
EC members that a ‘‘tremendous
showing’’ at the Homecoming concert
featuring Squeeze brought in $7,000
more than expected.

Wootton also said SAB saved
money on security for Homecoming
and gained additional revenues from
beverage sales.

Wootton also attributes the surplus
to good attendance at the two SAB-
sponsored bands that have performed
in the General Headquarters so far
this year.

She said the savings, along with a
cut in the number of movies and
comedians the SAB plans to bring to
campus this year, has allowed the
organization to cut its projected bud-
get for the year from $62,000 to
about $53,000. The EC granted the
SAB $55,500.

In other business, the EC granted
$1,020 to Women’s Club Basketball,
bringing the EC reserve under $400.

Also, the EC this week announced
appointments to Fancy Dress positons.
Elizabeth Vallotton, ’92 was ap-
pointed chairwoman. Lewis Perkins,
93, was appointed vice chairman,
and Lanie Merryweather, '92, auditor.

STU donates surplus

 

By Missy Curtis
Staff Reporter

 

Extra money that has built up over
the years will be donated by the
Student Telephone Union to or-
ganizations in the W&L community.

According to STU Tri-President
Jason Jenkins, STU is obligated by
contract with Centel and Virginia
Power to keep a certain amount of
funds available to cover fees if stu-
dents default on their phone bills.

Tri-President Jason Robinson ex-
plained that even if a student de-
faults on his or her bill, STU is only
liable for up to $100.

“‘But under the Honor System,’’
Robinson said, ‘‘students pay their

he said, makes it

Bane urged students to report any suspicious activity

they observe to security.

‘‘When you see a non-student who doesn’t look like
he should be here, call security so we can check him out

immediately,’ Bane said.

 

Angela Mims, ’93, Petersburg,

I wouldn’t want parents to

bills pretty diligently.’’

Jenkins agreed. ‘‘Over the course
of three or four years, money builds
up due to successful operation,’’ he
said.

Robinson said STU currently com-
mands a budget of about $24,000.
This year, STU has already donated
approximately $1,000 to WLUR-FM
to replace outdated equipment. Last
year, $12,000 was given to Live
Drive to purchase a new van.

“It has been decided in the past to
donate the extra money to a worthy
organization that will help out the
W&L community at large,’’ Jenkins
said.

So far this year, STU has received
requests for donations from Mock
Convention and the Outing Club.

The Reeves Center has been a hot topic in the news lately because of
possible endowment. Meanwhile the existing building has gone largely
unnoticed by students.

The Reeves Center for Research and Exhibition of Porcelain and Painting
houses over 2,000 pieces of Chinese and European ceramic pieces and decora-
tive art. The Center opened in the fall of 1982 and according to its director,
welcomes thousands of visitor each year.

“The Reeves Center is not a museum, it’s a research center,’ James
Whitehead, director of the center said. Whitehead has been the director since
it first opened and was greatly involved with initial acquisition of the 18th,
19th, and 20th century ceramics given to W&L in 1967 by Mr. and Mrs.
Euchlin D. Reeves of Providence, R.I., which makes up 98 percent of the
center’s collection.

“Interns and work-study students at the Reeves Center have a chance to
leam how to research pieces from scratch,’’ said inter Ulysses Hui.
According to Hui, work-study students and volunteers learn to research pieces
and apply those skills to a project.

‘‘The center gives people a chance to learn about art that you don’t get
anywhere else on campus,’’ junior Amanda Stewart said. According to
Stewart, though her intended major is politics, she chose the Reeves Center
as her work-study assignment because of her interest in art.

Whitehead said the majority of the work-study students are not art ma-

jors but have a strong interest in art.

Administrative Assistant Jeanna Chapman said Mr. and Mrs. Reeves
collected most of the ceramic pieces during their 25 years of marriage. The
center’s collection is especially rich in Chinese Export porcelain. Their most
spectacular piece is the ‘‘Hong’’ punch bowl which was made between 1785

and 1800.

‘‘Many contributors like to donate pieces to a center such as ours, be-
cause they would be used for research and not just looked at, as in a
museum,’’ Chapman said. ‘‘The students and volunteers learn the way
collectors would learn.’’

Whitehead said he has also spent many years trying to bring the art
world’s attention io the work of Mrs. Reeves, who as an artist is known
either by her maiden name, Louise Herreshoff, or Louise Eaton, after her first
husband. She stopped painting in 1927 after the death of her biggest
supporter, Aunt Lizzie. Chapman said Whitehead rediscovered Herreshoff’s
work accidentally, when the university first received the Reeves’ gift.

Chapman said her later paintings are reflective of her visits to Europe and
have won critical acclaim. ‘‘She has been called one of the leaders of post-
impressionism in America by renowned critic, William Gerdtz,’’ she said.

There are five major exhibition rooms in the two story center. These
include Chinese export porcelain for the American markets, Chinese export for
the English and continental markets, English ceramics, European ceramics, and
German porcelain. Herreshoff’s work is dispersed throughout the Reeves
Center. The armorial service that pictured the coat of arms of many
American patriots can be found in the center as well, including that of the
Lee family.

Tours and visits are available Monday through Friday between 10:30 a.m.
and 2:30 p.m. Please call 463-8744 for an appointment. There is no charge
for admission. For Parent’s Weekend the center will be open 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
friday and 9 a.m. to 12 p.m Saturday.

“Unless by word of mouth through students that work here, students
don’t ever know the Reeves Center exists,’"’ Chapman said.

‘The Reeves Center gives a chance to learn about the historical, political,
social, and religious aspects of the 18th and 19th century,’ Whitehead said.
‘The art gives us a better understanding of our history and the founding of
this university and this nation.’

ot. Joan helps the poor

 

By Jameson Leonardi
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee theater dep-
artment kicks off the 1991-92 season Thur-
Sday with Bertolt Brecht’s play St. Joan of
the Stockyards.

The play, which features a cast of 17
W&L students and one alumnus, presents a
case for simple, human values, said J.D.
Martinez, associate professor of drama at
W&L and the play’s director.

“I was getting tired of everything being
judged on economics,’’ Martinez said.
‘Money seems to be the only thing people
value. This play addresses the fact that
there are things of value other than money.”’

Martinez said that the play, which is set
in the Chicago stockyards, revolves around
a character similar to Joan of Arc. In the
process of attempting to help the poor, she
discovers the the inadequacy of religion and

then dies, Martinez said.

“It’s a play dealing with an immoral
economic system," Martinez said. ‘‘It can be
either communism or capitalism. It shows
that people in power are contemptuous of
those beneath them.”

Juniors Erin Walsh and Rich Cassone
will play the lead roles of Joan and Maul-
er.

The three- story set designed by senior
Macon Miles is the largest yet to be used in
a Lenfest Center production.

For additional effect, Larry Stene, as-
sociate professor of art, created 14 paintings
for the set.

“They are huge sculpted paintings of
slabs of meat and cows’ heads,”’
tinez. ‘‘They add a certain mood to the
set.”

The play will be presented in the Len-
fest Center’s Johnston Theatre on Nov. 1, 2

said Mar- §

7 and 9 at 8 p.m. and Nov. 3 at 2 p.m.

Dream comes true for Boreyko

 

By Jennifer Latham
Staff Reporter

 

Several local musicians will ex-
perience the Russian interpretation of
their music when Soviet conductor
Anderey Viktorovich Boreyko leads
the Washington and Lee University-
Rockbridge Symphony Orchestra in a
concert on Saturday at 8 p.m.

Dr. Barry Kolman, who is a
W&L music instructor and the con-
ductor of the URSO, said the visit
has been in the works for more than
a year and a half. A New York
agency that helps coordinate conduc-
tor exchange programs linked Kolman
with Boreyko. Kolman will conduct
Boreyko’s Ural State Philharmonic

Symphony in November.

Saturday’s concert will kick off
the orchestra’s fifth season. According
to Kolman, the URSO tries to get at
least one foreign conductor each year,
according to Kolman.

He said the group already has
guest conductors from Czechoslo-
vakia, Romania, Israel and Australia
lined up for the next several years.
He added that last year’s guest,
Brazilian conductor Florentino Dias,
is eager to return.

The URSO, which is comprised of
high school or college students and
local musicians and professionals, is
slightly smaller than Bereyko’s or-
chestra in Svedlovsk. Bereyko has
also. guest-conducted _— various
symphonies in his native country and

in Greece, and
Germany.

Kolman said securing Boreyko as
this year’s visiting conductor was
very exciting because such exchange
programs have not been possible in
the Iron Curtain countries before.

‘‘This is a brand new thing, not
just for musicians. Five years ago
many Soviets never thought they
would leave the country,’ Kolman
said,

Kolman said members of the
orchestra will not only experience
Bereyko’s interpretation of their
selected music, but gain a little
knowledge of soviet attitudes toward
the United States.

“Tl have a few students in the
orchestra who want to talk to him in

before Parents

For the kids:

1. DO hit your parents up for money. They're at their
most vulnerable this weekend.
2. DO get your hair cut before your parents arrive. If
they can recognize you as their offspring, they'll
probably give you more money.
3. DON’T forget to clean your room. Especially pick
up the month-old pizza boxes and hour-old beer

4. DON'T take your parents to class Friday morning.
Your parents will be the only ones there, and then
you'll all look like geeks.
5. DON'T let your parents pick you up for breakfast
on Saturday or Sunday morning. Tell them you'll
meet them there -- and make it brunch.
6. DON'T introduce your parents to any close friends
who don't have parents in town. Your friend will feel
free to embarrass you with stories about all the really
stupid things you've done in the past seven weeks.
7. DO ask your “(in)significant other’ about what's
okay to say around his or her parents.

Weekend do’s and don'ts
For the folks:

1. DON'T call your son “Binky” or other embarrassing
names in front of his friends.

2. DON'T tell the professors about how smart your
child is. Most of them won't believe you anyway.

3. DON'T bring back your son's favorite stuffed
animal or security blanket he left at home this fall.
4. DON'T call your son/daughter early Saturday or
Sunday morning. Chances are, he’s not in. (We'll let

them explain why.)

5. DON’T be nervous about your son's pledgeship.
It really is a growing experience.

6. DO stock the refrigerator for your kid. He/She
hasn't eaten a decent meal in weeks.

7. DON'T believe your child's room is always that

Parents converge
for 37th Weekend

 

By Jameson Leonardi
Staff Reporter

 

Parents from all over the country,
anxious to see their kids for the first
time in weeks, will converge on the
Washington and Lee campus this
weekend for the 37th annual Parents’
Weekend.

According to Chris Dieghan, assis-
tant director of development for infor-
mation services, 784 families have
pre-registered and 1,699 people are
expected to attend.

“A lot of families don’t register,
however,”’ Diegan said. ‘‘We really
expect more than 1,699 people to
attend,’’

A wide variety of activities have
been planned for the parents. Among
them are three concerts and one play
to be performed in the Lenfest Cen-
ter.

On Friday at 4 p.m., the Women’s
Chorus, Glee Club, Jubilee, and Sout-
hern Comfort will join with the Uni-
versity Wind Ensemble for a concert
in the Lenfest Center’s Keller The-
atre.

A second performance will be held
at 8:30 p.m. in the Keller Theatre
featuring the University Chorus,
Southern Comfort and Jubilee. They
will be joined by the University Wind
Ensemble.

According to music department
head Gordon Spice, this will be the
first year the choral groups and Wind
Ensemble will give two performan-
ces,

“All our concerts are now given in
the Lenfest Center, rather than Lee
Chapel,’’ said Spice. ‘‘The seating
capacity in the Lenfest Center is less
than it is in Lee Chapel, which cre-
ates the need for a second concert.”’

The University-Rockbridge Sym-
phony Orchestra will also perform in
the Keller Theatre on Saturday night.
Andrey Boreyko, the music director
of the Soviet Ural State Philharmonic
Orchestra, will be the guest conduc-
tor.

The Washington and Lee theatre
department will begin performances
of St. Joan of the Stockyards on
Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. and on
Sunday at 2 p.m. in Lenfest’s John-

son Theatre. The. play features 17 |

sentry my

W&L students and one alumnus.

Several athletic events are also
planned for the weekend, including
the annual Parents’ Weekend football
game. W&L, currently 0-7, will meet
Bridgewater College at 1:30 p.m.
Saturday on Wilson Field. Bridge-
water comes to Lexington 1-6,

Head Coach Gary Fallon said he is
expecting an exciting game.

‘Bridgewater is always tough,”’
Fallon said. ‘‘You can expect a very
rough game with lots of hitting.’’

The W&L Rugby Club also plans
a game for that afternoon. They will
play Longwood College at 12:30 p.m.
on the upper athletic fields.

In addition, several academic ac-
tivities are planned.

Many of the academic departments
will hold open houses on Friday
morning, and a special open house
for freshmen and their parents will be
held in the Lee House Friday after-
noon from 4-5:30.

University President John D. Wil-
son will deliver his annual report to
parents at 11:30 a.m. and again at
12:10 p.m. in Lee Chapel on Satur-
day.

Due to limited seating, those par-
ents whose names begin with A-M
are asked to attend the earlier session,
and the remainder are asked to come
at 12:10.

The Independent Union and Stu-
dent Activities Board will sponsor a
wine and cheese party for students
and their parents on Friday in Fairfax
Lounge from 7-10 p.m. The IU will
also sponsor a concert featuring Wild-
grass in Doremus Gym on Saturday
night.

The Minority Students Association
will sponsor an open house and rec-
eption at Chavis House on Friday at
7 p.m.

Freshmen expressed mixed feelings
about seeing their parents.

“‘Every day I forget a little more
just why I wanted to leave home,”
said Joyce Haynes from San Diego,
Calif.

Brent Avery from Marietta, Ga.
said he has mixed emotions.

‘*Parents’ Weekend will be inter-
esting,’ Avery said. ‘‘I’m sure
they’ll check my room in the middle
of the night to see if I’m drunk or
not.’’

Common Campus Colloquialisms

 

By Courtney Hall
Senior Copy Editor

 

Parents: you thought that the communication gap ended after puberty.

You assumed that as a mature, worldly college student, your son or
daughter would be able to communicate with you on an entirely new level.

But for the past seven weeks, your children have been busy either renew-
ing their mastery of or learning for the first time the intricacies of Wash-
ington and Lee lingo. (This may account for those low mid-term grades.)

In order to facilitate your weekend dialog, I’ve compiled the following
short list of commonly-heard campus colloquialisms:

* beat — an adjective that describes any unpleasant situation.
typically expressed in the phrase, ‘‘Awww, that’s beat.’’

« bummin’ hard — a passive verb that denotes serious distress; this phrase
is often heard resounding through the library late-night during mid-terms.

This is

"NS SORES GO ORE et
-* *
a! r é

vy Waals © ARES
ee ey 7 °3

¢ chafe — a noun referring to someone or something that rubs you the
wrong way. See road-cheese.

¢ did me wrong — this one is pretty self-explanatory, for example, ‘‘That
burrito at El Rodeo did me wrong.”’

¢ the Hill — refers informally to the main campus, but can also refer to
the administration; be careful to avoid ambiguous usage.

* maggot — this refers to your son if he is a freshman and a ‘‘new mem-
ber’’ of a fraternity.

¢ points — the absolute essential element to survival at W&L. These are
supposedly the equivalent of dollars; in effect, points allow students to eat
free. (This explains the survival of the menu at the Co-op.)

* road-cheese — refers to students from area women’s colleges. See chafe.

* score — action not restricted to the football team alone. (Ask your son.)

...That should be enough to get you through the weekend. Good luck,
and may your new knowledge serve you well.

The Ring-tum Phi, October 31, 1991

Fraternity members confused by Renaissance regulations

 

HOUSES

from page 1

 

Parsons said he understands the
students’ reactions.

“There are people living in the
[new] houses who are having to
adjust to a whole new level of expec-
tations,’’ Parsons said.

Many complaints from fraternity
members center around the univer-
sity’s inspections of their houses.

These inspections have resulted in
several fines for Phi Kapp, House
Manager Kevin Emerson said. He
said the infractions behind these fines
are often trivial.

‘*We’ve been charged a few times
for having ‘excess party dirt,’’” Emer-
son said. ‘‘What does the term excess
party dirt mean?’’

Lambda Chi junior Bill Donnelly
said the university has regulations for
every aspect in the house, no matter
how small.

‘*We actually had someone come
in and tell us our plants were in the
wrong place,’’ Donnelly said.

The university is simply protecting
its investment, Dean of Students
David Howison said.

‘The operational procedures were
designed to maintain the property in
a high standard and keep individual
houses responsible for [the houses],’’
Howison said. ‘‘We’re simply not
going to permit the houses to disin-
tegrate to the point they did 20 years
ago.”’

Emerson also said the fraternities
are supposed to be given 24 hours to
clean up after a party. However, Phi
Kapp has received fines the morning

after a party on two separate oc-
casions, he said.

W&L Assistant Construction Man-
ager Jim Boyd said he inspects each
house weekly.

“*My inspections are completely at
random,’’ Boyd said. ‘‘I don’t even
know when the parties are held.’’

Each fraternity does have 24
hours to clean its party room, said
Leroy ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins, associate
dean of students for Greek affairs.
However, the rest of the house must
remain clean regardless of the frater-
nity’s social schedule.

“The rest of the house is not
supposed to be messed up after a
party,’ Atkins said. ‘‘That’s why we
spent all this money to build such
nice party rooms.”’

Boyd said he sends a report
detailing the condition of each ren-
ovated house to Atkins, Howison, and
University President John D. Wilson.

Atkins explained that the univer-

stand,’’ Donnelly said. ‘‘{Boyd] will
just show up and tell you you broke
the rules.

“And the university, as far as the
administration goes, hasn’t been giv-
ing us any guidance at all,’’ he said.

Howison said the fraternities are
responsible for knowing the regula-
tions.

“It is a very systematic and regu-
lar system of accountability,’’ he said.
‘‘[The regulations] are there if people
want to take the time to understand
them.’’

Howison said fraternities can work
through their house mothers and the
Interfraternity Council to change any
regulations they dislike.

“We [the university] look to the
IFC for guidance,’’ Howison said.
“The IFC has real authority here.’’

Fraternity members living in the
renovated houses should be thankful
for their new houses, Sigma Nu
House Mother Beverly Coxey said.

 

‘And the university, as far as the ad-
ministration goes, hasn’t been giving us

any guidance at all’

— Junior Bill Donnelly

 

sity does not actually levy fines.

“The university doesn’t fine any-
body for any infractions of university
regulations,’’ Atkins said. ‘‘The busi-
ness office sends bills to the house
corporations for any maintenance we
have to do beyond normal.’

Several fraternities also said the
system of regulations is complex and
bureaucratic.

Donnelly said the fraternity does
not know what it is allowed to do.

‘‘We don’t know where we

“Anyone can nitpick and find
problems,’’ Coxey said. ‘‘I don’t
think the boys realize the cost behind
renovating these houses.”’

But many fraternity men said they
find the problems with their new
houses to be more than trivial.

Paint started to bubble and cracks
began forming in the walls of Lamb-
da Chi only two days after members
moved back in, Donnelly said.

“We told the workers about the
cracks in the walls,’’ Donnelly said.

 

 

‘‘They said it was to be expected,
because everything was rushed for
completion.’’

Coxey said she thought hurried
construction led to several minor
problems in the Sigma Nu house.

Additionally, Phi Delt House Mot-
her Mata McGuire said that while she
is pleased with the way the house
looks, she thinks some of the sub-
contracting could have been better
supervised.

“It wasn’t our intent to accept
anything substandard,’’ Parsons said.
‘It is possible that something was
done substandardly. We depend on
the architects to tell us when all the
specifications have been met, and
sometimes they don’t catch everyth-
ing.

Sinks, stalls, and towel hooks are
falling out of the bathroom walls at
Phi Delt, House Manager Rick Sum-
ner said.

““We're basically happy with our
house,’’ he said. ‘‘But we’ve been
telling the university about the prob-
lems with the bathroom all year.’

doors were kicked in or the posts
bent, Boyd said.

‘Any problem with the Phi Delt
bathroom resulted from misuse by the
brothers, not from faulty installation
or materials,’’ he said.

Parsons said work on some of the
houses didn’t meet specifications, but
these problems were promptly fixed.

“If the sinks [at Phi Delt] are
falling out now, it’s the Phi Delts’
fault,’’ Parsons said.

Several problems at the Sigma Nu
house have not been corrected, Presi-
dent Heath Dixon said.

He said the showers are clogged
about once every two months. Addi-
tionally, the toilets empty only after
they are flushed three times, and the
new fire-alarm goes off at least once
a week, Dixon said.

These problems can be easily
corrected with the replacement of
faulty parts, Boyd said.

Parsons said that problems with
Bass Construction, the Phase I gen-
eral contractor, have left some houses
with a few defects. But he said the

The Ring-tum Phi, October 31, 1991

Hannah, Herring pace W&L in firs

 

By Jacob Kimball
Staff Reporter

 

The first-ever Washington and Lee
Invitational cross country meet was
marked by a solid team effort as the
Generals placed their top five runners
in the top nine overall to clinch a
first place team finish.

In the six-team field, W&L’s
overall score came to 25. The next
competitor was Eastern Mennonite
with 45 followed by Mercyhurst,
Bridgewater, Hampden-Sydney, and
Randolph-Macon.

The top four finishers for the
team all ran the course in personal
record time. Junior Bo Hannah's time
of 27:08 secured first place overall
for him. Senior Charles Edwards was
strong again, finishing second overall
in 27:34.

The team ran without junior Keith

Rinn, a consistent third-place finisher,
but the Generals did not lose a step.
Senior Lee Parker stepped up to
finish sixth overall and third for the
team with a time of 28:56.

The top five was rounded out by
Matthew Brock in 29:03 and David
Phillips who recorded a time of 29:51
as they finished seventh and ninth
overall, respectively.

Also turing in personal bests
were Frank Martien, Justin Peterson,
and Larry Hautau.

Coach John Tucker was thrilled
with the number of personal records.

‘‘We ran with greater intensity
this week than in any previous
meet,’’ he said.

However, he is hoping that the
team can tum up the intensity yet
another notch for the upcoming meet
with H-SC and EMC. The meet will
conclude the regular season as the
Generals hope to ride into the Old

Dominion Athletic Conference cham-
pionship meet at peak condition.

Although still hindered by injuries,
women’s cross country coach Jim
Phemister felt that the team gave its
best effort of the season in the W&L
Invitational.

Without four solid runners the
Generals finished third out of eight
teams, behind Dickinson and EMC.

The results were different from
the recent meets with different run-
ners filling out the top five, but the
team’s top runner remained the same.
Freshman Kim Herring paced the
Generals again, finishing sixth over-
all, but this time she did so in record
fashion. Her time of 21:23 surpassed
Paige Cason’s record time of 21:49
set in 1987 for the fastest run by a
General on the home course.

Helping lead the way was Nicole
Casteel, who finished at 22:06 and in

eighth place overall finish. Both
Casteel and Herring shaved over a
minute off of their previous times on
the course.

Despite the work of the regular
top finishers, the improvement came
from the runners who stepped up to
fill the shoes of those who were
sidelined. Brandi Henderson, Amy
French, and Deirdre Denechaud chop-
ped their times considerably as they
clinched the third place finish by
coming in third, fourth, and fifth,
respectively for W&L.

Run and shoot falls short vs. Sewanee

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

When you haven’t won a game
six weeks into the football season, it
doesn’t hurt to throw caution to the
wind. Or a lot of footballs.

In last Saturday’s game at
Sewanee, the Washington and Lee
football team scrapped its familiar I-
formation attack and went with its
own version of the run and shoot
offense.

‘*We hadn’t spent a whole lot of
time on it,’’ said head coach Gary
Fallon. ‘‘But it upset Sewanee’s
defensive rhythm and allowed us to
move the ball up the field and get a

Although the Generals effort came
up short on the day 21-13, the of-
fense showed an ability to control the
ball for extended periods of time for
the first time this season. That came
as a relief to the defense.

“It was a great confidence builder
for the defense,’’ said defensive end
John McCallum, who had a team-
high 16 tackles. ‘‘Watching the of-
fense move was worth its wait in
gold. Even though we didn’t get long
rests because the run and shoot
moves quickly, there’s nothing like
the good psychological lift watching
the offense move.’’

W&L went to the run and shoot
in the second quarter with freshman
quarterback Geren Steiner. At the end
of the game, Steiner had thrown 50

passes, completing 27 for 203 yards.
His favorite target was classmate
William Propst, who caught 12 passes
for 114 yards.

W&L trailed 14-0 before the
special teams got the Generals on the
board. Freshman Michael MacLane
returned a blocked punt for a touch-
down, cutting Sewanee’s lead to 14-
7 at the half.

After the Tigers scored to make it
21-7, Steiner tried to rally the Gen-
erals. He capped a long drive with a
14-yard scoring pass to Propst to
make it 21-13, but he could bring the
Generals no closer.

‘‘The offense caught fire and had
some success,”’ said Fallon, ‘‘and that

second half.’’

Next up for the Generals, 0-7 on
the season, is Old Dominion Athletic
Conference rival Bridgewater. The
Eagles come into the game 1-6 over-
all. Both teams are looking for their
first ODAC win.

Bridgewater is one of W&L’s
fiercest rivals, and some bad blood
exists between the schools.

McCallum said the rivalry goes
beyond bad blood.

“It’s pure hatred,’’ he said.
‘They hate us and we hate them.
And neither team wants to finish at
the bottom of the ODAC. It will be
a fight.’’

From W&L Sports Information

 

The Washington and Lee vol-
leyball team suffered a tough loss
in its final regular season match
on Wednesday.

Hollins topped W&L 15-13,
15-12, 16-14 to drop the Generals
to 10-20 on the year. W&L led in
each of the three games.

The loss drops W&L, 3-7 in
conference play, to eighth place in
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference. The Generals will host a
first round tournament game on
Nov. 5.

The loss soured W&L’s four-
game win over Sweet Briar on
Thursday. W&L topped the Vixens
15-6, 15-8, 9-15, 15-4.

W&L was led during the week
by senior Mena McGowin. Mc-
Gowin’s 19 kills put her over the
200 mark for the third straight
year.

Polo dunks H-SC twice

The Washington & Lee water
polo team continued its domination
over Hampden-Sydney this past week-
end while tuning up for the Southern
Conference Championships.

Due to the cancellation of the Fall
Classic two weeks ago, the Generals
scheduled two matches against Hamp-
den-Sydney to prime themselves for
the remainder of the season.

In the first match, held at Hamp-
den-Sydney on Tuesday, senior Alan
Herrick and freshman Tony Diederich
combined for three goals apiece to
pace the Generals’ attack in an 11-6
victory.

As has been evident all season,
the reserves rose to the occasion and
preserved early leads in both games
against the Tigers. Freshman Derek
Devries contributed two goals in the
first game while reserve goalie
Michael Flippen looked strong in the

 

Twombly Pool on Friday, the Gen-
erals received two goals each from
Herrick, John Kannapell, Greg Golub
and Andrew Pearson to cruise to a
10-8 win.

In addition to the strong offen-
sive play, Remillard was encouraged
by the play of goalies Flippen and
PJ. Waicus.

“Our goalies’ confidence is re-
turning,’’ he said. ‘‘They have to
focus on blocking future goals instead
of worrying about goals that have
gotten by them.”’

Such confidence will be a must to
subdue the potent offenses the Gen-
erals will face at the Southern Con-
ference Championships.

Despite being ranked third in the
field of five teams, the Generals feel
they will be an aggressive underdog
when they match up against rivals
Arkansas-Little Rock and Richmond.

weekend,”’ said Kannapell. ‘‘We fecl

ATHLETIC CONFERENCE SOCCER TOURNAMENTS

Murphy-led men steal 3-1 win from H-SC

 

By Sean O’Rourke
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee men’s
soccer team is off to the semifinals
of the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference tournament.

The Generals earned a four-hour
bus ride to Virginia Beach, Va.
where they will tangle with the na-
tion’s second ranked team, unbeaten
Virginia Wesleyan.

W&L will take the field with a
modest four-game winning streak.
The Generals’ most recent conquests
came over Lynchburg, 4-2, and
Hampden-Sydney, 3-1. The win over
Lynchburg clinched the Generals
home field advantage in the first
round of the ODAC tournament, and
the win over H-SC came in the first
round of the tournament.

The Lynchburg game was yet
another gutsy come-from-behind vic-
tory by the Generals in a season of
come-from-behind wins. The team
found themselves down 2-0 before
senior Winthrop Allen scored on a
pass from classmate David Hooker.
Allen’s goal cut the Hornets’ lead in
half and gave W&L some momentum
heading into halftime.

The offense exploded in the
second half and took the game away
from upset-minded Lynchburg. Soph-
omore Dan Rhodes tied the game
with an unassisted goal. He then
assisted on the game-winner scored
by junior Kyle Fanning a few min-
utes later. Reid Murphy closed out
the scoring barrage with his team-
leading sixth goal of the season.

‘“‘T saw a lot of character out
there,’’ said head coach Rolf Pir-
anian. ‘‘We hung tough, there was a
lot of fight in the kids, and it was a
great comeback.”’

The win gave the Generals a
home game in the first round of the
tournament, and the Generals didn’t
disappoint their fans.

Despite a scoreless first half, the
Generals dominated H-SC, controlling
the action throughout.

W&L’s offense got some help
from the H-SC defense. The Tigers

box, and the ever-present Murphy

When the goalie misplayed a high
bouncing ball, Murphy scored again
to reclaim the lead. W&L iced the
game a few minutes later when Mur-
phy completed his hat trick, taking a
feed from freshman Sam Drennan,
who put the ball in front of the goal,
and knocking it home as he collided
with the goalie.

Piranian seemed pleased with his

team’s overall effort.

“*We had a few good stretches in
the first half, and a solid second
half,”’ he said. ‘‘We just haven’t
played a full 90 minutes yet.”

season, will need a full 90-minute

ODAC rematch vs.

The Washington and Lee
women’s soccer team shut out
Sweet Briar 2-0 Wednesday in the
first round of the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference tournament,
setting up a rematch of last year’s
championship game.

This time, though, W&L and
Roanoke will play in the semi-
finals, Friday afternoon at Lynch-
burg. The Generals are this year’s
top seed, while Roanoke is the
defending champion. The teams
played to a 0-0 tie earlier this
year.

Senior Katie Seeman and
sophomore Corinda Hankins each
scored a goal early in the first
period to give the Generals the
lead, which they kept easily for
the remainder of the game.

‘We've had a good week,”’
said head coach Janine Hathorn.
“T felt like we were successful in
the ways we should have been.’’

With a 1-0 win over Messiah
Saturday and a 4-0 decision over
Sweet Briar last Thursday, the
Generals clinched the ODAC title
and brought their regular season
record to 7-4-2 overall and 6-1-1
in ODAC.

“IT was proud of our play,”’
said Hathorn. ‘‘It’s fun when you
execute well.’’

Against Messiah, sophomore
Aspen Yawars chalked up the
lone goal in the early minutes.

‘We played a strong team in
Messiah,’’ said Hathorn. ‘‘Some-
times when you work hard you
get lucky.”’

impressive 4-0 win over the Generals
two weeks ago.

Despite the tough challenge, Pir-
anian is very optimistic.

‘*We're excited for the rematch,”
he said. ‘‘I think it comes down to
us being prepared to play our game a
little bit better than last time. We
need to approach it as a team.”

2-0; earn

She commended senior Nancy
Mitchell and sophomores Allison
Lewis and Karen Stutzmann, who
“really played well.”’

Sweet Briar was overcome
easily with goals by senior Mor-
gan Warner, junior Andrea Car-
damone, Stutzmann and freshman
Amy Jefferson.

“The whole team is playing
very well,’’ Hathorn said. ‘*Some
of the fruits of our labor are
showing.”’

If the Generals are successful
against rival Roanoke on Friday,
they will return to Lynchburg on
Saturday to play the winner of
Randolph-Macon vs. Lynchburg
for the championship.

‘‘We feel deserving of our
number one seeding, and we want
to show people that we are,”’
Hathom said. ‘‘This is where you
see what your team is made of.”’
