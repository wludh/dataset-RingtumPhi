MC on
track with

budget

By Jennifer Latham
Staff Reporter

 

 

Mock Convention remains in
stronger financial shape than its 1988
predecessor while providing more
speakers and other activities, said MC
Treasurer Jay Darden.

““We’re spending very well and
getting a lot more for our money,”’
Darden said.

He said MC’s mailings and
phone-a-thon bring in revenue daily,
and funds raised last spring term
have also increased revenue, giving
this MC greater financial resources
than the previous one.

 

‘*We have
access to a
great deal
more money
than the last
convention
had,’’ Darden
said.

While MC
spent about
$136,000 in
1988, this con-
vention expects
to spend bet-
ween $175,000 and $190,000, Darden
said. So far, MC has spent about
$30,000 to $35,000, he said. The
convention has about $95,000 remain-
ing and expects individual states to
raise the final $40,000, Darden said.

“Each state is responsible for
raising the money to supply its own
activities,’ Darden said. ‘‘If they
raise less than that, then they will
make do with less.’’

The convention's greatest expenses
have come from new offerings to the
student body, Darden said. He cited
events like the November Presidential
Gala and the Spring Kickoff.

‘‘For Spring Kickoff, we spent a
little less money [than the 1988 con-
vention] and provided more for stu-
dents,’’ Darden said.

Alpha awaits OK
from nationals

IFC votes 11-4

By Rick Peltz
Editor

 

 

Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity may
begin colonization at Washington and
Lee whenever it is ready, but that
will not be until 1992-93, if at all.

The Interfraternity Council voted
11-4 on Nov. 21 to approve re-es-
tablishment of the W&L chapter of
the historically black fraternity.

Now the proposed chapter must
receive approval from the national
fraternity at its next convention in the
summer of 1992, according to Karen
Sullivan, a spokesman in Alpha’s
membership department in Baltimore.

If Alpha does open here for 1992-
93, it still will not participate in fall
Rush, as its academic requirements
will bar freshmen until winter term.
So the soonest Alpha will solicit
freshman members is 1993.

Sullivan said Wednesday that
Alpha’s national Committee on Stan-
dards and Extension will review the
proposed W&L chapter to determine
“if there’s a need for it,’’ she said.

‘‘There’s no guarantee it'll be
approved,’’ Sullivan said.

Meanwhile, Alpha has met all the
requirements of the W&L fraternity
system.

The IFC vote in favor of Alpha
represents 73 and one-third percent
of the voting council members, just
short of the constitutionally-mandated
three-fourths.

Under Robert's Rules of Order,
which governs IFC under the coun-
cil’s constitution, the difference may
be rounded if a precedent of rounding
has been set, according to Lewis La-
Rue, alumni law professor.

IFC President Greg Hicks said
Tuesday he did not know at the time
of the vote that 11 out of 15 was
less than 75 percent. But he said he
is comfortable with setting the prece-
dent of rounding, because 11 out of
15 is closer to three-fourths than 12

out of 15 is.

Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Kappa
Sigma, Pi Kappa Alpha and Sigma
Chi voted against Alpha.

IFC Treasurer Thomas Snedeker
said SAE President Gene Pride was
late to the meeting but said when he
arrived he would have voted in favor
of Alpha.

Hicks announced his support for
Alpha at an IFC meeting on Nov. 12,
11 days after the Student Affairs
Committee approved Alpha.

‘*This school is big on student
autonomy,’’ Hicks told IFC. ‘‘To get
[Alpha] turned down goes against a
lot of what this school stands for,’’
because students are petitioning to
bring Alpha, he said.

Senior Courtney Penn, one of the
petitioners for Alpha, said Wednes-
day that the re-establishment of the
fraternity represents his most im-
portant contribution to W&L in his
four years here.

‘*We’ve worked hard,’’ Penn said.
“This will be a pretty big graduation
present.”’

Sophomore Maurice Cole, a black
student who attended the vote, said
that the vote on Alpha was a step
forward for W&L.

“It’s a positive statement being
sent out that the other houses and the
school in general will not neglect a

the latest possible start. So we were
left with shortening Christmas break
to two weeks,’’ Dittman said.

The committee, which is com-
prised of five appointed faculty mem-
bers, proposes the schedules several
years ahead of time. The university
faculty must approve the recommend-
ed calendars.

Over the past few years, several
proposed amendments to the current
system have been rejected by the
faculty, or were not supported by
student who were polled, Dittman
said.

Suggested changes have included
creating a three-day weekend in Oc-
tober and starting school earlier, he
said.

The schedule currently includes
two 12-week terms and a six-week
term in the spring. In addition to
December break, the calendar allows
for 10-day breaks before spring term,
during Thanksgiving and for Wash-
ington’s birthday in February.

Dittman said calendars have been
scheduled through the 1995-96 school
year, and those will remain un
changed unless some new ideas are
addressed by the committee.

Superdance 1992 will make a donation to MDA in the name
of Andrew Slay, son of Joe Slay, '72. The boy has spinal
muscular dystrophy.

 

 

dance will raise money for one of
W&L’s own this year, according to a
press release from Superdance Co-
Chairman Fred Renneker.

All proceeds from this year’s
event will go to the Muscular Dystro-
phy Association in the name of And-
rew Slay, the five-year-old son of Joe
Slay, ’72, Renneker said. Andrew is
confined to a wheelchair because he
suffers from spinal muscular dystrop-
hy, a neuromuscular disorder.

Superdance grossed more than
$30,000 last year. Renneker said the
goal is to raise even more money this
year.

Superdance Co-Chairman Laura
Hendrey said researchers are close to
finding the gene which causes MD.

‘‘They’ve narrowed it down from
three billion possible genes to just
two million, and that means it’s real-
ly within striking distance,”’ she said.

Superdance, which will be held
Feb. 8-9 in the pavilion, will feature
a ‘‘Battle of the Bands’’ and a dance
band Friday night. On Saturday night,
the winner of Friday’s contest will
open for The Truly Dangerous
Swamp Band.

 

 

Two top-level Soviet economists
will spend next Monday and Tuesday
lecturing at Washington and Lee.

Vladimir Koblov and Yuri Yare-
menko will give two public lectures
as part of the newly created William
Lyne Wilson II Symposium Series.

Koblov, acting chairman of the
State Military Industrial Commission,
is a member of the Soviet cabinet.
He is charged with changing the
Soviet economy from a military base
to civilian control.

Koblov will speak at 7:30 p.m.
Monday in Commerce School 327 on
“The Political Economy of Reform.’’

Yaremenko, chief economic ad-
visor to the State Council, is charged
with reorganizing the Soviet economy
from a command base to a competi-
tive free market.

Yaremenko will speak at 7:30
pm. Tuesday in C-School 327 on
‘The Political Economy of Crisis.’’
. Arriving Saturday, just ahead of a
threatened Soviet pilot’s strike, they
will spend until Wednesday meeting
with classes and having dinner with
faculty and students.

“It is very unusual for cabinet-
level officials to travel out of the
country for so long,’’ Program Direc-
tor Craig McCaughrin said. ‘‘They
will be traveling directly to Boston to
sign the latest Soviet aid package.”’

The two Russians will be accom-
panied by official interpreter Oksana
Kozhina. Kozhina was an exchange
student at W&L last year.

“*T think the credit for setting all
this up really goes to Oksana for
being our contact,’’ McCaughrin said.

William Lyne Wilson I, '27, the
grandson of the late University Presi-
dent William Lyne Wilson, was a
frequent W&L benefactor before his
death in November 1989.

Now you know
how it feels

Well now, it seems our fine hosts in this fair city have gotten
a little taste of their own medicine, and it doesn’t look like they
like it a bit.

The Lexington City Council and many area residents have
been in a tizzy of late over Adelphia Cable’s $3.00 rate hike.
Mayor H.E.‘‘Buddy’’ Derrick spent most of a recent council
meeting whining that the increase was unfair and unjustified,
and, darnit, he was mad.

‘The city is powerless,’’ he said. ‘‘We’ve scheduled a public
hearing to amass public opinion to show [Adelphia] that people
disagree with what I consider to be an excessive increase.”’

What we find funny is that he and his compatriots seem most
upset over the fact that they have no control over the cable
company’s rate schedule. Lexington’s contract with Adelphia is
not up for review until 2003, and short of suing the cable
operator, it looks like viewers can’t do a thing except sit back,
pay their three bucks, and enjoy the moder miracle of cable
television.

Let’s look into our scrapbook and see if we can’t remember
the last time people around here were upset that they were being
charged a fee they had no way of avoiding and no say in
implementing.

Here it is, just a few pages back. It seems the ol’ Lexington
City Council itself thought it would be a great solution to its
budget problems if it started charging W&L and VMI students
a tax on their personal property.

“Yeah, why don’t we tax their cars,’’ the council reasoned.
“Since students don’t have any say in city government, we can
force the students to pay anything we want. And the best part
of the plan is those rich little kids can’t do a thing about it.’’

Now we’re not so sure we’re on the side of Adelphia.
Unregulated monopolies do tend to do bad things, but somehow,
we’re just plum out of sympathy for our city council members
and their fearless leader, Buddy.

Dear Santa,

We know it’s still 20 days till Christmas, but since this is our
last issue until January, we figured we’d better get in our wish
list now. We’re not asking for much this year, things have been
going pretty well for us. However, there are a few other people
we know that could use a thing or two. They might not include
these things on their own. lists, but we know what they really
need: :

For President Wilson: a colonnade of his very own on which to
build as many art galleries as he wants.

*For Brian Shaw: a red-phone hotline to the Phi office so he can
alter or spike any story he feels might jeopardize the good
name of Washington and Lee.

*For the Generals: a one-game season, preferably only a last
game season.

*For the EC: a reserve reserve fund.

*For Pi Phi: a oor a .

*For the student body: magazines! magazines! magazines!

*For the IFC: a calculator.

*For Dean Elrod: a new schedule book so he won’t be able to
complain if he misses another deadline.

Quote of the Week

Imelda, Part Two:

She made a surprise farwell visit Saturday to her late husband's
shed-like wooden crypt outside Honolulu. After aides opened the
tomb and then the casket, she spent more than an hour with the
corpse. She wept, prayed, dabbed its shiny forehead, held its stiff
hand, ran her fingers through its black wig and whispered in its
waxen ear. She twice invited photographers up to the wooden
platform to record the ghoulish scene.

Jolly old Santa Claus in Lexington? Join in singing as Swann gets the perfect gift

 

LET IT RIDE
By Chris Swann

 

Contrary to popular belief, I am
not an alcoholic, but the following
piece probably won't dissuade you
from thinking that I am. Merry Christ-
mas and Happy New Year, and may
Santa visit you as well...

’Twas the night ‘fore exams
And all through the school

Not a student was studying,
As a general rule.

Our stockings were hung
By the coldbox with care,
In the hopes that beer bottles
Soon would chill there.

John Wilson was settled
All snug in his bed,

And visions of arts centers
Danced through his head.

(My roommate was snoring
And having a dream;

For him, Santa poured
Some vodka, it seemed.)

While all alone (sob)

I could not wait ‘till later;
I had just settled down

To write my term paper.

When out on Main Street
There arose such a clutter
I sprang from my desk
To pull tight the shutter.

 
   

Columnist objects

A full moon did shine
On the new-fallen snow,
Brightening the drab scene
With an ethereal glow. By the damn reindeer
When what did I see fly,
Like a bat out of hell,
But a miniature sleigh

I'd be glad to provide it
Pulled by eight tiny elves.

For a reasonable fee.’

And over the groans
Of the elves did I hear,
A deep gravelly voice
That was no reindeer.

He shook his head sadly,

‘On you dumb little sprites,
Or I'll fix you quick,”’
Yelled a voice that could only

Belong to St. Nick.

I sighed to lament this,

Like a cool mountain

To the end of the street
And not a bit more,

Cried the elves with one voice,
‘‘Our damn feet are sore.’’

I asked him to spare me

He said, ‘‘Excuse me,

Then I noticed with horror

That they sped toward my home,
Eight maniacal elves

And me, home alone.

So I told him my story,

The roof they did hit
With a shattering smash,

And all tumbled in quickly
Through the hole with a crash.

We're heavily in debt,
California’s on fire,

I won’t bore you with details
On how St. Nick looked;
You know well enough
If you read a Christmas book.

He gave me a lollipop,
Said, ‘‘Here you go!

Not a word did he say
But went straight to his task,
Grabbed a beer from the fridge
And chugged in a flash.

I yelled, ‘Stupid elf!
You fat, greasy slob!

I don’t want your gifts,
I just need a JOB!”’

LETTERS

NBC if he was to say on the air that Mike Dit-
ka’s errors in coaching the Chicago Bears led

 

I whispered, ‘‘What happened
To Donner and Vixen?’’
The elves muttered, ‘‘Strike

St. Nick winked and said,
‘‘Any item you need?

I said, ‘‘Nice five-four blonde,
Are there any around?’’

Said there’s none to be found.

Then pulled out some Beam;
Said, ‘‘Here, this goes down

The commercial palaver
But just what is the matter?’’
Said I was tired of the world;

How we've just had a war
And th’economy’s absurd.

And I’ll probably go bankrupt
‘Fore my parents retire.

This’ll help bring you out
From your miserable low.’’

   

Then I trembled and shook

At the deed I had done;
I had just screamed at Santa Claus,
union.”’ Our patron of fun! ‘
But Santa just chuckled

And said, ‘‘Is that it?
I think I’ll find something
: That you will find fit.’’

And out of his bag
He slowly withdrew
A small wrapped-up package
That read, ‘‘From Santa to you.”’

And when I had opened it
I shouted for joy;
In my hands lay a JOB,
stream.’’ Better than any toy.
I turned ‘round to thank him
For the heavenly gift,
But as I said thank you,
His spectacles slipped. ,

He looked not a whit
Like Santa Claus then:
To my utter astonishment,
It was SAINT BOB, our friend!

With a pull on his ear
And a sneeze through the nose,

He just disappeared; '
Through the roof-hole he rose.

The elves all did cheer
Upon leaving my room;

Yet Saint Bob said nothing,
Just flew up to the moon.

But I did hear him say,
‘Fore he passed out of sight:
God rest ye southern gentlemen
Y’all drink well and sleep tight!

to Neurock firing

To the Editor:

Forget the fact that I am a humor columnist
whose every word leaves you quivering with
glee. I’m pissed off today.

Three weeks ago, WREL-FM radio in Lexing-
ton fired disc jockey Mitch Neurock. They fired
him for doing his job. While commenting upon
a Lexington High School football game against
Buena Vista, which the Lex High team severely
lost, Neurock said that he believed bad coaching
calls led to the defeat.

After the game, Coach Nola of the Scarlet
Hurricanes heard about Neurock’s commentary.
He subsequently called WREL and complained
about Neurock’s opinion. Consequently, WREL
fired Neurock.

Does this seem strange to any of you? That
a ‘‘sports commentator’’ (and the only thing
close to a professional disc jockey that WREL
had), commenting on a game’s coaching dec-
isions, got canned because the coach whined to
the radio station? I don’t know who to be more
mad at, the station or the coach.

Let me insert that Mitch Neurock is a friend
of mine, but he is also a third-year law student
at Washington and Lee. In other words, he’s a
member of our student body.

I’m not advocating anything as drastic as
marching on WREL or fire-bombing the owner’s
home. But the fact that someone got fired be-
cause of the fragile ego of a high school football
coach leaves me appalled. ‘‘Neurock at Night’’
may not have been the best radio show ever
produced, but it was the only one I listened to in
Lexington. Would Dan Dierdorf be fired from

them to lose a game? The whole affair is absurd.

I have not spoken to WREL or Coach Nola
because I’m in the middle of exams. But I would
definitely like to, and I plan to find out more.
Somebody ought to call or write the station and
tell them to get their best DJ back, or they'll be
awfully lonely broadcasting to radios switched to
‘off.’

Sincerely,
Chris Swann, ’92

Peer counselors listen more than tr

Peer counselors are not ‘‘mini-

Ologist James W. Worth says that’s a
common misconception students have
about the group.

“They are not advice-givers, they
are not ‘Dear Abby.’ They are not
there to rescue people,’’ Worth said.
“They are only there to listen and
help people learn what is best for
themselves,"’

New group
will revive
old forum

By Nicole Keeler
Staff Reporter

 

 

A group of Washington and Lee
women are trying to revive the old
Women’s Forum, which was replaced
by Trident a couple years ago.

Sophomore Kate Stimeling is part
of a 13-woman ‘‘core group’’ she
said believes Trident lost its influence
when sororities came to W&L. The
new group wants to provide a place
for women to meet regardless of their
sorority affiliations, she said.

The group, which held its first
meeting on Nov. 21, is currently
writing a charter and making plans
for future activities.

Erika Lee, a member of the gro-
up, said Women’s Forum plans to
bring well-known female speakers
like U.S. Rep. Pat Schroeder and
television correspondent Diane Saw-
yer to W&L, as well as foster discus-
sion groups on topics like bulimia
and anorexia, date rape and nutrition.

Stimeling said the group also
wants to include W&L men in its
membership. She said the group will
try to increase men’s understanding
of women.

‘‘Men are the antithesis of
women,’’ Stimeling said. ‘‘They’ll
give [us] an opposing opinion.’’

SAB to feature
MTV comedian

By Missy Curtis

The Student Activities Board is
bringing actor and MTV comedian
Dan Wilson to the General Head-
quarters 8 p.m. tonight.

Wilson, who has performed on
MTV’s ‘‘1/2 Hour Comedy Hour,’’
in the movie Dog Fight with Keanu
Reeves and at more than 100 col-
leges, headlines Christmas activities
this week, said John Flippen, SAB
special events coordinator. Kevin
Jones, another comedian, will open
for Wilson.

The SAB will sponsor more com-
edians Wednesday nights in the GHQ
and bring a ‘‘really big comedian’ to
WA&L in the spring, Flippen said.

He said the basic premise is that
‘sometimes students are not ready to
talk to a professional counselor be-
cause they don’t want to or because
it’s not that big of a deal.’’

He said the peer counselors are
mainly trained in listening skills
because ‘‘being listened to by some-
body can be a very nurturing ex-
perience.”’

Additionally, peer counselors are
taught problem-solving _ skills
‘because 90 percent of students have

their own problems,’’ Worth said.

Worth said that the majority of
problems counselors deal with are
“the common daily hassles of college
life that get you down,’’ such as time
management, or problems with room-
mates, friends or romances.

But Worth stressed that peer
counselors are trained to know their
limits and what types of situations
they can handle.

“Students who come to a coun-
selor with bigger problems such as
eating disorders, depression, sexual
assault or a desire to commit suicide
are to be referred to myself or Dean

dean of students and counselling
psychologist],’’ Worth said.

“‘We are not trying to tum stu-
dents into mini-psychiatrists,"’ Worth
said. ‘‘That would be impossible and
irresponsible to try.’

Counselors said they mostly hear
from people they already know, rather
than people who call anonymously.

“Several times I’ve had people
come up to me and start talking to
me, and gradually I'll realize that
they’re talking to me as a peer coun-

group of students who desire to par-
ticipate in the fraternity system,’’
Cole said.

Sigma Nu President Heath Dixon,
who voted for Alpha, said he opposes
historically single-race fraternities in
principle, but believes the current
W&L fraternity system does not meet
black students’ needs,

Phi Kapp President Marc Short
said Nov. 19 that one argument agai-
nst Alpha was that it might segregate
the campus. But he said any chapter
voting against Alpha would have to
commit to improving black students’
social lives if Alpha did not pass.

The IFC vote on Alpha was post-
poned from the regular Nov. 19 IFC
meeting to Nov. 21 by Hicks. He
wanted to give fraternities that did
not attend the Nov. 18 information
session more time to talk to the Al-
pha petitioners.

The information session was led
by Penn, seniors Jonathan Harris and
William Toles, and a representative
from Alpha.

In this season of final papers and exams,
what's your favorite way to reduce stress?

At that Nov. 18 information ses-
sion, Executive Committee President
Giles Perkins urged fraternity mem-
bers to vote against Alpha.

‘‘My... reservation about... Alpha
..is that it will promote segregation
on this campus,’’ Perkins. said.

Petitioners for Alpha at the Nov.
18 session objected to Perkins state-
ment, saying that the W&L fratemity
system does not meet their needs.

“Try to relate to what we’re
going through [as black students],’’
Harris, a former Chi Psi member,
said. ‘‘I gave it [the W&L fraternity
system] a shot for two years. It was
not what I want in fraternity.’’

IFC members on Nov. 18 also
asked petitioners why the Alpha
chapter at W&L in the 1970s closed.

Penn said that chapter closed due
to low membership, and Harris said
that will not be a problem with the
new chapter.

“All we're asking for is an
honest shot,’’ Harris said. ‘‘Let’s not
hypocrisize about numbers.’’

Drive promotes
registration

 

By Jennifer Mayo
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington. and Lee College
Republicans will sponsor a voter
registration drive after December
break to encourage students to par-
ticipate in their hometown elections.

Chairman of the College Repub-
licans Amanda Stewart said it is not
easy to get students politically in-
volved at home while they are at
school.

“We really can’t do much to
register students,’’ Stewart said.

But the drive should make it
easier for students to obtain absentee
ballots and participate in their home-
town elections that they might have
otherwise missed, Stewart said.

She said students should register
to vote during December break.

“They have to go to city court-
houses at home to register, but we
can obtain absentee ballots in Lex-
ington for those students who sign up
to receive them.’’

entangled in the plots of feature
films.

Get out your stockings and trim your trees! Christmas
is coming and Lexington is pulling out all the stops. For
the sixth year in a row the Lexington Downtown Dev-
elopment Association is coordinating ‘‘Merry Lexington’’
and ‘‘Holiday In Lexington.’’

One of the big events this weekend is the Community
Christmas parade. There will be floats, and marching
bands, and ribbons in six categories and prize money in
two.

The parade route will travel down Houston Street to
Main Street. It will travel down Main Street until
Washington Street where it will take a right and travel
down to Varner Street. The parade will begin at 11 a.m.

Senior Gabrey Croft is assisting LDDA with the
parade.

Croft, parade chairman for Mock Convention, said she
would be helping LDDA with the marching order and
placement of stakes where there will be a need for people
ready to help in case of problems on Friday night. On
Saturday, she will be at the parade early to help out.

“I’m trying to help the interaction between W&L and
the community,’’ Croft said.

The Christmas spirit is not confined to town. W&L
will be the sight of many holiday activities as well. The
fraternities will be hosting Christmas Weekend parties and
decorating for the holidays, and many students are
decorating their own rooms.

University President John Wilson and his wife Anne
Wilson are also preparing for the holidays. The pres-
idents house will be a feature of the ‘‘Historic Holiday
House Tour’’ on Saturday, and will be decorated for the
event. Mrs. Wilson said the LDDA requested that the
Wilsons allow the Jefferson Florist to decorate the house.

“IT usually do the decorating myself. We like to
decorate with a lot of greenery such as magnolia, and
wreaths along the staircase, which the Jefferson Florist
will be doing,’’ Mrs. Wilson said.

The large Christmas tree outside is a different story.
At press time Mrs. Wilson had not been able to find out
from Buildings and Grounds exactly when the tree would
be decorated and lit.

rated.

Mrs. Wilson said she believed it would be decorated
before the tour.

The Wilsons will be decorating the indoor tree
themselves.

Merry Lexington will begin on Sunday Dec. 8 and
will continue until Jan. 6 Merry Lexington is a com-
bination of open houses for 57 business, holiday concerts,
theater events and much more.

LDDA’s main role is to coordinate the open houses with
the other events and produce a calendar of events for the
month. The calendar may be found at many of the
participating stores.

‘Merry Lexington is a good combination of public
and private coming together,’’ said Herrick.

Most of the open houses will offer refreshments and
a discount of some kind, and many will be ready with
Christmas gift suggestions.

Beth Thompson of The Best Seller said ‘‘it benefits
the community, it’s fun and it makes Lexington look like
a fairy land.”’

Some merchants are working in conjunction with one
another to offer new gift ideas. Paula Cushman of
Postmarks and Pleasures said that they will be working
with Harbs’ to create gift baskets. Spanky’s is also

offering gift baskets.

Cushman said Merry Lexington ‘‘is wonderful. I’m
from a big, big city and there’s nothing like this. It’s a
feeling of unity and it restores your faith.’’

The final event of ‘‘Merry Lexington’’ is Twelfth
Night Bonfire, which will be held at Lime Kiln Theater.

LDDA along with Aldelphia Cable helped to dec-
orating the town. Adelphia has donated their basket truck
to help decorate the taller, private buildings in town. The
Lexington Public Works Department decorated all of the
public building and streets.

Starting this Friday will be ‘‘Holiday In Lexington,”’
a weekend event that begins with an open house at
Cambell House, and end with two performances of The
Nutcracker Ballet.

W&LIFE

in Lexington wy

WSL featured on tour

 

By Cathy Lopiccolo
News Editor

This weekend two Washington and Lee
fraternities are expecting a few guests -- about
1,000, to be exact.

The newly-renovated Beta Theta Pi and Pi
Kappa Alpha houses will be open to the public
Saturday afternoon as part of Lexington’s
Historic Holiday House Tour. The tour, spon-
sored by the Lexington Downtown Development
Association, features eight homes in the city
and on the W&L and Virginia Military Institute
campuses.

The tour, which will run from noon to 5
p.m. Saturday, is being presented as part of the
annual ‘‘Holiday in Lexington’’ weekend.

The LDDA included the fraternity houses on
the tour because of the public interest in the
recent renovations, LDDA Executive Director
Diane Herrick said.

“The public likes to see the changes that
have been made, especially with them being
decorated for Christmas,’’ Herrick said.

Beta Housemother Marnie Stewart said she
volunteered the Beta house for the tour at a
meeting of fraternity housemothers.

‘Our home is so nice and new, so I thoug-
ht we’d show people the big change,’’ Stewart
said. ‘‘I think all the people will be pleased.”’

The Beta house will be decorated outside
and on the first floor, including the house-
mother’s quarters. Stewart said Town and
Country Garden Club members will be trimm-
ing the house and will act as hostesses for the
afternoon.

“(The garden club members] thought deco-
rating a fraternity house would be a great
challenge,’’ Stewart said. ‘‘All the ladies have
been by to see the house and plan the decora-
tions.”’

Stewart said several fraternity members will

also be on hand to answer questions about the
house.

The PiKA house will be decorated simply,
but elegantly, Housemother Ann Davis said.

“*The feeling of the house was that less
was more,”’ Davis said. ‘‘The gentlemen didn’t
want the decorations to be fussy.”’

Davis said PiKA will be decorated with
greenery and garnet bows to complement the
house’s simple Shaker furniture.

The university provided both Beta and
PiKA with Christmas trees grown on the W&L
property at Skylark, Davis said.

In addition to the fraternity houses, homes
on the tour include the residence of Mayor H.E.
‘*Buddy”’ Derrick, Stonegate, the Pendleton-
Coles House, the VMI Superintendent’s Quart-
ers and George C. Marshall Library, and the
Lee House.

The first level of Lee House will be shown
on the tour, and will feature Lee family heir-
looms. Visitors will see an 18th century grand-
father clock in the central hall, and will visit
the drawing room, the dining room, the library,
which was originally Mrs. Lee’s bedroom, and
the music room which served as the Lee family
sitting room. Featured in the music room will
be the Lee piano, and photographs of the house
during the Lee years.

Twelve members of Chi Omega sorority
have also volunteered to sell tickets and con-
duct house tours on Saturday, Chi-O Service
Chairman Amy Beall said.

‘*All we have to do is go to certain loca-
tions and help guide tours through the houses,”’
Beall said.‘‘The LDDA really wants to make
the tours nice this year, and they appreciated
the help.”’

Tickets for the tours are $6 for adults and
will be available Saturday at tour locations and
at the tourist center on Washington Street.
Tickets can also be purchased in advance from
the Jefferson or University florists.

Generals top Sewanee to open year, fall to ranked teams

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

Despite losing three of its first
four games, the Washington and Lee
basketball has not pressed the panic
button as it heads towards exams.

‘“*We’ve got ten new players,’’
said head coach Verne Canfield. ‘‘We
have played a very difficult schedule
so far, and we’re struggling to get
everyone acquainted with themselves
and our system. But we’ll come
around.”’

The Generals won their first game
of the year, but since have dropped
three games in a row to teams ranked
nationally. Seventh-ranked Wooster,
11th-ranked Hampden-Sydney and the
preseason pick to finish fourth in the
South region Bridgewater represent
W&L’s three losses.

The Generals opened the season

with a 67-58 win over Sewanee in
the first round of the W&L Tip-off
Tournament. Sophomores Paul Baker
and Robert Miggins led a second-
half charge that erased a 19-6 first
half deficit.

Baker scored seven of the
Generals’ first 12 second half points,
and Miggins scored seven points in
the second half, including the basket
that gave W&L the lead for good.
Once W&L got the lead, Sewanee
never got closer than six.

Junior Bryan Watkins scored a
career-high 17 points to lead the way,
and Baker added a career-high 11.
Junior Bryan Brading was also in
double figures with 10 points, and
Miggins added nine points and nine
rebounds in the win.

Wooster dominated the champion-
ship game, using a balanced inside
attack. The Scots opened up a 34-12
first half lead behind tournament

MVP Stan Aukamp’s 11 first half
points: The Generals made a late run.
Miggins scored seven points late in
the half to cut the Wooster lead to
36-21 at the half.

Wooster pulled away in the sec-
ond half. The Scots 55-31 when
W&L made a run to make the score
respectable. Sophomore Matt Newton
scored seven straight points and
freshman John Rogers added four and
the Generals cut the lead to 63-47
before falling 76-53.

Miggins led W&L with 13 points
and a game-high nine rebounds and
was named to the all-tournament
team.

‘Robert has some nice tools that
will be useful,’’ said Canfield. ‘‘He
does some good things at both ends
of the floor.”’

After falling to Hampden-Sydney
84-55, the Generals looked to even
their record at 2-2 against Bridge-

water last Sunday.

Rogers scored 12 points in the
first half, and the Generals opened up
a 35-31 halftime lead despite playing
without starting point guard Brading.
Newton filled in with five first half
points.

The Generals went cold in the
second half, shooting a miserable 28
percent, and Bridgewater used a dunk
and blocked shot from Ashley Wat-
son to overtake the Generals and pull
away for a 74-61 win. Watson hit all
seven of his shots, and the Eagles
shot 59 percent for the game and 63
percent in the second half.

Watkins led the way for the Gen-
erals with 16 points. Rogers did not
score in the second half and finished
with a career-high 12.

“IT was disappointed with the
Bridgewater game,’’ Canfield said. ‘‘I
thought we should have won, but we
didn’t run our offenses and didn’t

execute on defense.”’

Despite the disappointing loss,
Canfield is pleased with his young
team’s early effort.

‘‘We’re playing hard,’’ he said.
‘I’m pleased with our attitude. We're
correcting our mistakes and making
progress every day.’’

The Generals will look to move
the progress from the practices into
the games this weekend. The Gene-
rals play Pomona-Pitzer in the first
round of the Washington University
Lopata Basketball Classic in St. Louis
Friday night. Washington U. plays
M.LT. in the other first round game.
The consolation and championship
games are Saturday.

“It’s nice to be amongst academic
teams that have similar priorities to
us,’’ said Canfield. ‘‘But it’s tough to
play teams we don’t know much
about.’

The Generals return home next

 

week to take on Emory and Henry
before breaking for exams.

Hannah saves best
race for last meet

 

By Jacob Kimball
Staff Reporter

 

After running a strong race in the
regional meet, Bo Hannah and Char-
les Edwars returned to Newport
News, Va. to run in the NCAA Di-
vision III Championship Meet on
Saturday, Nov. 23.

Just the week before, they had
recorded their respective fastest times
of the season, and they returned to
try to better their times, and to run in
the most competitive race of their
lives.

Hannah and Edwards found them-
selves among the mass of 177 run-
ners that earned a birth by either
being a member of one of the top 21
teams in the nation, or by finishing
in the top five of one of the eight
regions across the United States.

Hannah, a junior, ran with the
lead pack for,the first three miles and
finished the race 40th overall. He
bested his fastest time ever by 30
seconds as he finished in 25:22. With
that finale, Hannah had recorded a
personal record time in each of the
last three races of the year, each the
biggest of the year at the time: the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference,
regional, and national championships.

“Bo ran as well as I thought he
could in Regionals,’ said coach John
Tucker. ‘‘Then he took thirty seconds
off that time. It was incredible. He
ran a stronger middle and also looked
stronger coming across the finish
line.’’

Charles Edwards, a senior, also
finished very strong in the last race
of his collegiate career. Edwards’
finish brought him in 107th in a time
of 26:25. Edwards finished his stel-
lar career and season strongly. He
recorded the same personal record
time in his last two races.

The winning time was 24:26, and
the top 15 runners were all under 25

Editors and a Business Manager are wanted for the new
monthly news magazine sponsored by the Publications
Board. Applications for these jobs should consist of a letter of
interest, including qualifications. Applications are due to Rick
Peltz at P.O. Box 40 on Dec. 20. Applicants will be contacted
to set up interviews, which will be held on Monday, Jan. 13,

beginning at 8 p.m.

This will be the mission of the new magazine:

 

BASKETBALL, INDOOR TRACK, SWIMMING, WRESTLING

minutes. The 25 finishers receive all-
American designation, and Hannah
was only 15 seconds off that pace.

However, this was an exceptional-
ly competitive race according to
Tucker.

‘‘Bo’s time would have won
Regionals last week, and would have
brought him in the top 25 at Nation-
als last year.”’

Hannah’s performance was _ the
second best in W&L history. Only
Angus Mcbride and his 10th-place
finish at the 1984 National Cham-

pionships.
Edwards and Hannah turned in
remarkable individual accomplish-

ments throughout the year, but Tuck-
er was also pleased with the overall
team effort this season.

‘In all of the years I have
coached, this was the best team as
far as improvement and performance
level when you look at where we
began and where we finished.’’

The Generals finished 8-1 and
were the only team to defeat #1
ranked Lynchburg in a scored meet.
Tucker noted that the team really
came together at the end of the sea-
son. Eight out of the twelve team
members ran personal records in the
last or next to last race of the season.

The team is poised to have a-
nother strong season next year.

“We will lose both Charles and
Lee [Parker] out of our top five, but
I look to freshmen Matthew Brock
and Doug Boyles along with junior
Jim Gilreath to be strong contributors
and help fill the void,’’ said Tuck-
ee”

And don’t forget Hannah. He led
W&L in every race this season, and
will return next year to try and top
this year’s effort.

‘Coupled with Lynchburg losing
their top two runners, the prospects
for winning ODAC’s may be brighter
than ever.’’

Two weekends ago, the Wash-
ington & Lee men’s swimming team
opened its season with three suc-
cessive meets, two against Allegheny
and one against Centre in the W&L
Dual Meet Invitational.

The outcomes of those meets sent
out mixed signals as to the type of
season the Generals were going to
have. The team opened on Friday
against powerhouse Allegheny, losing
119-67. W&L returned on Saturday
to trounce Centre 134-42. The Gen-
erals then met Allegheny again on
Sunday losing again, but by a more
respectable score of 123-79.

Despite the roller coaster scores,
coach Page Remillard was upbeat
about his team’s performance.

“I was pleased with how we per-
formed. We swam well, and if this is
a starting point, it’s a great one.’’

The Washington and Lee women’s
swimming team had a promising
showing at their first official meet of
the 1991-92 season back on Nov. 23
and 24.

The Generals hosted the first
annual Dual Meet Challenge against
Allegheny and Ithaca, both of whom
are nationally ranked, and Centre,
who offered an evenly matched team
both in skill and numbers.

The Generals beat Centre 95-87
behind junior Claire Dudley. Dudley
won the 100-yard freestyle and the
200-yard breaststroke.

First year coach Kiki Jacobs was

by Dudley’s performance.

It was especially great for Doug ,

scored a meet-high 53 points.

Pearson followed with four wins, ,
and Rowe, only a freshman, added

Remillard wanted his team spirited
when the Generals took on VMI in a’
meet last night. Remillard said the ,
Keydets made some negative remarks
about W&L’s swimming team. '

‘‘We can’t be too pumped up for
this meet,’’ he exclaimed prior to last '
night’s meet. ‘‘Their comments in,
their school newspaper were unedu-
cated, and therefore, wrong.‘ !

The Generals definitely proved the
Keydets to be wrong with a convinc- '
ing 137-67 drubbing of their in-town ,
rivals. W&L was again led by
Brown, Pearson and Rowe. The trio’
was responsible for seven wins.

The win brings the Generals to an

Freshman Susan Fisher also won ‘
twice. She won the 200-yard back-
stroke and the 400-yard individual
medley. '

W&L also got strong showings
from seniors Jodi Herring and Louise '
Adamson, sophomores Kari May and,
Jeanette Burgess, and freshmen Stacy
Cofield and Brandi Henderson. :

Allegheny and Ithaca both topped ,
the Generals soundly, but the Gen-
erals displayed some strong individual’
performances. ‘

Cofield took first in the 100-yard
freestyle on Friday and Fisher won‘
the same race against Allegheny.

The Generals will next swim in
the Cy Twombly Pool against Sweet:
Briar on Dec. 10. The meet, which
opens the Old Dominion Athletic’
