of the Phi Staff
The for-
mer VMI cadet W&L
charged with | freshman
the October | testifies
rape of a W&L_ | Hudnall raped

freshman will
face a Rock-
bridge County grand jury Feb. 3.

Chad Hudnall, 18, faces charges
of forcible sodomy, rape, breaking
and entering and grand larceny.

In a preliminary hearing Dec.
17, Judge Joseph E. Hess heard
testimony from an 18-year-old W&L
woman who said Hudnall raped her
and forced her to perform oral sex in
her room in Gilliam Dormitory.

The woman said she awoke at
about 4 a.m. on Oct. 13 and found
Hudnall naked and on top of her.

The woman testified that she
asked Hudnall to stop. She said when
he later released her and began
looking for his clothes, she demanded
to know his name. According to the
woman, Hudnall replied, ‘“That’s not
important.”’

The woman said she threw on a
sweatshirt, ran into the hallway and
screamed for help. Three male
students detained Hudnall in another
room until W&L security arrived.

The woman, who testified she
had been drinking earlier that
evening, said her bedroom door was
unlocked.

The woman said she did not
know Hudnall, but had seen him
visiting Christine Harvey, a dorm
counselor in Gilliam.

Hudnall, who did not testify

her

that he stole more than $300 from
Harvey’s room the same evening.

Harvey testified at the
preliminary hearing that she met
Hudnall at a W&L fraternity party
and he had visited her several times
in her room.

Harvey, who was not in her
room at the time of the alleged rape,
said she returned to her room later
that evening and discovered the
money was missing. Harvey said she
had left her door unlocked.

Harvey testified that someone
had also drawn on her mirror in
lipstick and burned part of a
photograph in her room.
r Lab tests
later identified

the scorched
photograph as
belonging to
Hudnall.
Police
officer Gary
i: Coleman
Pestitied
Hudnall Hudnall told
him he had been drinking the night of
the alleged rape and wanted to see
Harvey. Coleman said Hudnall later
asked if Harvey would drop the
charges if he got her money back.
Coleman said a_ search of
Hudnall’s room at VMI did not tun
up the money. He testified that the
$354 was turned over to police a few
days later after another cadet found
the money in one of Hudnall’s boots.
Hudnall, a resident of Newport
News, Va., withdrew from VMI
within days after the charges were
filed.
He is currently being held in the
Rockbridge County Regional Jail.

set of women’s formal Rush parties begin tomorrow night, with
over 160 rushees expected to attend.

Competitive Rush predicted this year

 

By JENNIFER MAYO
Phi Staff Reporter

 

Panhellenic Council members
say this year’s sorority Rush may be
the most competetive one yet for the
approximately 160 rushees who will
participate.

Washington and Lee’sororities
will kick off their fourth Rush Friday
night with Open House parties.
Rushees will meet members of the
three existing sororities — Kappa
Kappa Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta
and Chi Omega — and Pi Beta Phi,

which hopes to form a chapter on
campus this winter.

“‘Because so many girls are
going through, it will give sororities
themselves more choice because we
will be releasing girls earlier. If
they’re really interested in one they’ll
have to work to let its members
know,’’ said Panhellenic Delegate
Amanda Stewart.

This year’s Rush will differ
from those in the past because of a
new arrangement designed to guaran-
tee Pi Phi a large number of pledg-
es.

According to an agreement
between Pi Phi nationals and the
W&L sororities, almost half of the
women who complete Rush will
receive bids from Pi Phi. The
remaining rushees will be divided
among the three other sororities.

Sororities must release a large
number of women after the second
set of parties and will invite fewer
rushees back for their third and fourth
sets of parties this year.

Rushees must also drop one
sorority from their rush dates. After
the last parties on Wednesday night

rushees will rank their three favorite
sororities on preference cards.

The sororities will issue bids
Thursday afternoon.

Outside of the formal Rush
parties, no-contact rules for sorority
members and rushees remain in effect
until next Thursday.

‘“‘So far, there have been no
rush violations, but we have a week
to go,’’ said Panhellenic President
Dale Wyatt. ‘‘I hope every one can
keep a clean slate.”’

Washington and Lee is considering moving

| fraternity Rush from fall to winter term, but the
} move would leave male freshmen with nothing
| to do during their first semester at college,

university administration said.

“‘Right now, [winter rush] is not possible
because there is no tangible example of a [so-
cial] alternative,’’ said Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy”’
Atkins, associate dean of students for Greek af-
fairs. ‘“There have to be some other things for
freshmen to do.”’

Dean of Students David Howison said the
Student Affairs Committee, which has discussed
the move for about a month, is following a
recommendation in ‘‘The Washington and Lee
Institutional Long Range Plan 1990-2000,”
which was written by students, faculty and
administrators in 1989 following an extensive
study of the university.

“Beginning in January 1993, provided the
university introduces other changes, we recom-
mend that fraternities institute a winter rush,”’
the plan states.

Howison said the issue needs to be dis-
cussed.

 

'SAC urges discussion
of holding winter Rush

“I feel it is appropriate for SAC to consid-
er this issue because of the charge of the Long
Range Plan,’’ Howison said.

But Atkins said W&L has not made the
plan’s ‘‘other changes’’ upon which a move to
winter rush is conditioned.

“‘T agree with winter rush, but first we
need to meet certain conditions,’’ Atkins said.

Specifically, he said W&L has not met the
plan’s recommendation for a new and expanded
student center. Without one, Atkins said, either
male freshmen will have no social outlets, or
fraternities will be forced to unofficially rush
freshmen throughout the 12-week fall term,
placing an unreasonable financial burden on
them.

The plan also classifies construction of a
new Student center as ‘‘critically important.”’

Darren Braccia, president of Pi Kappa
Alpha agreed with Atkins.

**Winter rush would be really tough on
us,’’ Braccia said. ‘‘Everybody hates it [Rush]
now. Imagine if it lasted 12 weeks.’’

Professor Lewis John, who was dean of
students in 1989 and headed the committee that
reported on freshman life, agreed that a winter
rush would require the university to provide
more social opportunities for freshmen.

The Delt bar

Delt renovations on hold, SAC to punish chapter

 

 

 

 

Photo by Leigh Allen, The Ring-tun Phi
Vandalism left a hole in a wall at the end of a bedroom hallway
upstairs in Delt.

The Delta Tau Delta House Corporation tempo-
rarily suspended the fraternity’s participation in the
Fraternity Renaissance Program after vandalism to
the house, and the chapter faces at least critical
probation from the university.

According to Dean of Students David L. Howi-
son, the Interfraternity Council, Student Affairs
Committee and Student Conduct Committee are
looking into charges that Delt members broke win-
dows, destroyed walls, dismantled a brick bar and
removed ceiling tiles in the chapter house.

“The house was reduced to general mayhem,
but there was no serious damage,’’ Delt junior
Patrick McCabe said.

The Delt House Corporation had agreed to
transfer the title to the house and property at 106
Lee Avenue under the Rennaissance program.

Delt House Corporation President Taylor Cole
said he discovered damage to the house on Dec.
22. He then reported the damage in letters sent to
Howison and Associate Dean of Students for Greek
Affairs Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins.

In the letter, Cole said he was suspending the

transfer of the title until the situation is resolved.

Howison said, ‘‘I’m waiting on the official
report from the Delt president. Things are on hold
until then,’’

W&L Director of Capital Planning Frank
Parsons said he expects the delay in Delt’s Renais-
sance participation to be temporary.

‘*We’re ready to go ahead with bids to contrac-
tors once this situation is resolved,’’ Parsons said.

According to Atkins, Delt has been referred to
the Student Affairs Committee. SAC can vote to
terminate or suspend Delt, or put the chapter on
“‘critical probation,’’ he said.

Delt appeared for an IFC judicial meeting Tues-
day night. IFC referred the matter to SAC, recom-
mending critical probation.

IFC President Greg Hicks refused to comment
on the results of Tuesday’s meeting saying only,
“‘The IFC is handling the situation.’’

Delt President Chris Barker also refused to
comment Tuesday night.

Despite the investigation, Cole displayed
confidence in Delt’s future at W&L.

“In the past this has been one of the best
houses on campus,’’ Cole said. ‘‘The house will
have huge potential after Renaissance.”’

No justice in
judicial hearings

Just last month our nation celebrated the 200th
anniversary of the adoption of the Bill of Rights. These first
10 amendments to the Constitution guarantee the basic
liberties of speech, press and assembly, and they establish
rules of faimess in judicial proceedings. Over the years these
laws have been clarified and expounded by the United States
Supreme Court. The trend has been toward open
government, especially in matters that concern us all.

It is ironic that as we celebrated the Bill of Rights, two
major organs of justice at Washington and Lee were hiding
behind closed doors: the Interfraternity Council and the
Student Conduct Committee.

The bylaws of IFC give the body broad powers to close
its meetings. IFC’s Executive Committee can arbitrarily
decide what parts of the meeting shall be closed, and all
hearings before IFC Judicial Board are closed.

Decisions made by the Judicial Board affect the future
of W&L’s fraternity system. Such decisions are important
not only to the members of houses involved, but, in the long
run, to all men affiliated with the fraternity system (about 80
percent of W&L men). Moreover, there is no way to ensure
equitable punishments without the check of a free press. The
system can only benefit from opening these judicial hearings.

The judicial functions of SCC are even more deeply
shrouded behind a veil of secrecy. Students called before
SCC are students accused of disturbing our community’s
peaceful existence, possibly abusive behavior and certainly
behavior that warrants community attention. With all
hearings on the matter shielded from view, the community
can not give such hearings the attention they deserve.

But more importantly, the closed hearings afford SCC
the ability to abuse the power they have been granted by the
student body. While the judicial functions of the Executive
Committee deal with a single sanction, SCC may impose a
variety of sanctions that might or might not fit the crime.

Further, while those accused by the EC have the
undeniable right to an open trial, those accused before SCC
may appeal only to a closed session of the Student Affairs
Committee, a body dominated by faculty and administrative
interests. Nowhere, at no time will an SCC defendant be

given the right to plead his case to the public.

Clearly, SCC and IFC have to weigh the benefits to the
accused by maintaining secrecy against the benefits to both
the accused and the community through an open judicial
process. We maintain that the benefits to the accused are
marginal while benefits to the community, paired with
additional benefits to the accused, are great. At the very
least, an open judicial process should be an option for the
accused.

Secrecy is outdated. The accused, both individuals and
fraternities, wishing to hide behind the secrecy clauses will
be less inclined to break the rules if they know they will
face the public.

This week we were informed that SCC was punishing a
member of our community. Was the individual given a fair
hearing? Was the punishment reasonable relative to the
offense? We may never know the truth in that case or any
other.

The tale of the
lonely beer bottle

 

My VIEW

By Frederick Ryan

 

 

 

 

 

Be aware that

 

Once upon a time — along a windswept bay, a long- _
necked brown bottle blew buoyantly ashore. When the
waters receded, it was plain to see that this was no ordinary .
bottle. Inscribed upon the glass was this special message:

Caution: ‘‘The contents herein contain Alcohol, a
mood-altering drug. Consumption of small amounts has _
Proven to be a reliable source of good cheer; larger
amounts, conversely, have proven quite hazardous, and

. have resulted in loss of sobriety, consciousness, health and
life. Be aware that Alcohol is an addictive drug; excessive ’
consumption and its associated hazards can remain unchal-
lenged for a lifetime. Be especially aware that deception
remains a subtle but powerful characteristic of this drug; its - *
abuse has caused many to erroneously believe that the
associated destructive effects can be avoided by adopting

a personal attitude of apathy,
defiance or denial.”’
Brewer’s Recommen-

dation: ‘‘It is the sincere

powertul ed for someone else. We

of this drug. tion.””

An old man slowly
lowered the bottle. With a

renewed sense of hope, he believed that somewhere,
perhaps ages ago, people young and old cared; cared
enough to read each bottle faithfully, and always drink in
moderation. The bottle slipped carefully into his coat
pocket as he started for home. While he walked, he
wondered. When? When would the generations of his
society be so blessed to understand that Alcohol is a drug
and fully realize that it is destructive?

Swann’s predictions for the new year

 

LET IT RIDE

By Chris Swann

 

I’m sure we all want to start off 1992 with a
big Happy New Year to the Athletic Department
for holding gym sign-up Monday moming at 8
a.m... NOT. I mean, do these guys want to make
it difficult for me to graduate, or what?

1991 was a fairly interesting year, all things
considered. Communism fell, unemployment rose;
the Braves almost won the World Series, a bona:
fide sign that God does exist; and, of course, we
can’t forget the little target practice session George
Bush held in the Middle East. I sometimes think
CNN staged the Gulf War so they could get all
those Nielsen rating points. The new year promises
to be just as interesting. I see it going something
like this:

January — January 21 will become National
Activists Day to celebrate all the wonderful rebels
out there. The date is chosen to coincide with
Martin Luther King, Jr. Day on the 20th (my
birthday, for all loyal fans who wish to send gifts)
so government workers get a four-day weekend.
(Not to ridicule one of the greatest peace activists
ever, but we need another national holiday like we
need more music from Skid Row and Cinderella.)

February — Yitzak Shamir, facing wavering
support in Israel, finishes the job and nukes Sad-
dam Hussein’s bunker in Iraq, thereby placing a
five-thousand-year moratorium on the world’s oil
supplies. Shamir becomes the Israeli answer to
George Washington... Medical experts discover
that red M&Ms really do give you cancer.

AIDS coverage

To the Editor:

shows media flaw

 

The now fading memory of our nation’s
outburst of concem with the AIDS virus in
response to Magic Johnson’s contraction of the
disease exposed the deplorable state of media
coverage in this nation and the perverted per-
spective it provides our society.

For years since the initial outbreak of AIDS,
with its attendant homophobic paranoia and
scorn for the sick, people have been dying.
And as they have been dying, the issue has
slipped to the back page or even disappeared
altogether. Like every other important issue, the
press forgot about AIDS until something sensa-
tional happened — something people would care
about. Somewhere along the line, the press ran
out of concern. But the people were still dying.

What does it say about our society when
one famous athlete’s contraction of AIDS
focuses more attention on the issue than the
miserable deaths of innocent thousands?

Maybe the best thing for our response to
AIDS in this country would be the contraction
of the disease by more of the only kind of
people that seem to provoke widespread inter-
est in the issue — celebrities. It made me
tremble to watch the swell of attention lavish-
ed upon AIDS in response to one man’s con-
traction of the disease. Where was the media
when the others were dying? Where were the
calls for more research when the people who
were not famous were suffering? Now Magic

energy plant, thus off-setting the loss of all that
nuclear-poisoned oil. Another California group
protests that the sun’s rights are being violated,
beginning a 19-month lawsuit.

April — The Democrats decide to nominate
Franklin D. Roosevelt as their presidential candi-
date. Bush’s popularity plunges even further... For
April Fool’s, Iraq invades Yugoslavia and declares
a cease-fire. Serbs and Croatians unite peacefully
for the first time in living memory to eradicate the

fools. ‘

 

A cure for AIDS? President
Quayle? a, Burgers? National
Activists Day? Canadian
annexation? What else will the
future bring?

 

May — Salman Rushdie, the famous author-in-
hiding of The Satanic Verses, is discovered to be
Jimmy Hoffa. Puzzled Moslem fanatics withdraw
their assassination requests as the Teamsters enter
their own... Germany retakes the former German
part of Poland and annexes the Baltic states just
for the hell of it.

June — The Commonwealth of Independent
States, formally the Soviet Union, attacks Japan as
a goodwill gesture toward the United States...
Doctors discover a cure for AIDS in an effort to
save Magic Johnson.

July — Just to join the warfare trend in the
world, and to give the military a reason to exist,

America should have annexed them... Bush cuts

Student arrests
drop last term

To the Editor:

Last year, in an effort to increase awareness
of student disciplinary issues and promote more
responsible behavior in our community, I
compiled the student arrest records in the City
of Lexington beginning fall 1988. One-hundred
Washington and Lee students were arrested
during fall term 1988 for alcohol-related be-
havior that included DUI, possession, drunken-
ness, noise and litter. During fall term 1989, 74
students were arrested.

In fall term 1990, with the cooperation of
the Interfraternity Council, the Lexington City
Police and the Lexington Community Council,
a coordinated effort was made to improve
communication between the University and the
Lexington community. Our goal was to address
issues before they became problems. The
periodic meetings between IFC leaders and
Bruce Beard, Chief of Police, were especially
productive.

Perhaps as a result of these efforts, the
number of Washington and Lee students arrest-
ed during fall term 1990 dropped to 45. For the
just concluded fall term 1991, 35 Washington
and Lee students were arrested for alcohol-

August — Reporters discover that Magic
Johnson never had AIDS, but merely said so in
order for the government to get off its collective
butt and give enough money to medical research-
ers to discover a cure... The NFL announces it is
disbanding due to a lack of coaching personnel.
Dan Dierdorf and John Madden offer their servic-
es, thereby dooming professional football for the
coming decades.

September —-+ Ina desperation move, the
Democratic party nominates Dan Quayle for
president, hoping to place all blame on him.
Quayle accepts the nomination on the grounds that
Pee-Wee Herman be his running mate... Steven
Spielberg films Bad Man in Baghdad, casting Burt
Reynolds as Saddam Hussein and Clint Eastwood
as Norman Schwarzkopf.

October — The Atlanta Braves win the World

player Ron Hrbek joins the World Wrestling

November — Dan Quayle wins the presiden-
tial election, forcing masses of Americans to flee
north and free Canada. George Bush is elected

America... Mikhail Gorbachev, final president of
the former Soviet Union, opens a fast-food fran-
chise in Miami. ‘‘Gorby Burgers’? become the
rage, and the profitable restaurants inject masses of
dollars into the economy, thus ending the reces-
sion.

Phi Staff Reporters

Dick Vitale of ESPN and
ABC Sports fame will speak in
Doremus Gymnasium on Jan. 29
after the Hampden-Sydney
basketball game.

Known for his unique
sportscasts and coaching career,
Vitale will address goals and
victories in his presentation.

Vitale has been recognized
for his talks on SportsCenter’s
‘Fast Breaks.’’ He also coached
the Detroit Pistons and recently
chronicled his 1990-91 season
in the book Time Out, Baby!

Vitale’s newspaper columns
and motivational ‘‘Say No To
Drugs’’ speech have also earned
national publicity.

Contact and the
Interfraternity Council are co-
sponsoring Vitale’s appearance.

‘Historically, the IFC has
provided one-third of our
budget,’’ said Contact
spokesman Marc Short. “‘Last
year, the IFC voted to
discontinue this and Contact lost
a big portion of its budget.

‘“‘This year, we asked the
IFC to fund one speaker. They
agreed to Dick Vitale,’’ Short
said.

While the IFC is providing
money for Vitale’s appearance,
IFC President Greg Hicks said,
*‘Contact is taking care of all
the details.’’

IFC is contributing to the
Vitale agreement from a fund
collected from chapters on a
per-head basis. Hicks would not
say how much the IFC
contribution is.

Tim Gallagher, chairman of
Contact, said Vitale’s speech
will be ‘‘great for the basketball
program, because he’s the best
in the business.’’

Shoplifting rise

Holiday

made their | suspect

together in
many local recent thefts
store windows
last month,

Several local merchants placed
warnings that ‘‘ALL Shoplifters will
be prosecuted’’ on their shop
windows and doors, an action that
some owners had never considered
before.

“*(Shoplifting] has become a
reality and a concern, and it is what
we are addressing now,’’ said Diane
Herrick, executive director of the
Lexington Downtown Development
Association.

Herrick said that she suspects
that W&L students have been
involved in the thefts, but not
exclusively.

Linda Plogger, manager of
TGIF Outlet Stores at 30 S. Main St.,
said she experienced a couple of
instances with W&L students.

‘We have had an instance last
February where a couple of
Washington and Lee girls put on
bathing suits under their clothes and
left,’ Plogger said.

Plogger said the girls had left
the store before she had a chance to
stop them, and she didn’t file a police
report.

‘‘T know who they were, and if
they come back in here, I'll be
watching them,’’ she said.

But Plogger said that her
experience with W&L students has
been almost entirely favorable in the
past.

‘*Most of the [W&L] kids who
come in here are very good,’’ she
said. ‘“There is generally no problem
because they are on the Honor
System.”

W&L Dean of Students David
Howison said the fact that W&L

_ Under _ White’s . leadership,.. the __ library, [j

collection was cataloged, probably for the first. .. }

 

She is indispensible, she has the answers, she
stays up all night long and she is a computer.

The Washington and Lee library’s new
computerized catalog has been named ‘‘Annie’’ in
honor of Annie Jo White, founder of the Fancy
Dress Ball and former university librarian.

The committee chose the name because it is
‘‘short, easy to pronounce and spell, and one that
had a significant Washington and Lee connection,’’
said University Librarian Barbara Brown, who

headed the committee.

‘More importantly, it is appropriate that we
honor a woman who was such a friend to

students,’’ Brown added.

The committee came up with the name, rather
than choosing one from the about 150 entries in a
campus-wide contest it conducted last fall, Brown
said. The committee could not agree on any of the

entries, she said.

White, known as ‘‘Miss Annie Jo” to W&L
students, was appointed university librarian in
1895. She retired in 1928 and died in 1938.

time, Brown said. White also increased library
hours and supervised the move of the collection to
what is today the Commerce School.

White was known by students for raising
money for theater projects and athletic teams. A
crew boat in the 1890s was named Annie Jo.

White founded Fancy Dress as a costume ball
in 1907 with a $42 budget. She attended every FD
except one until she died.

Known for her spirited nature, White had an
encounter with the law during Prohibition when she
purchased bottles of Scotch and rum through the
mail. Then University President Henry L. Smith
intervened to prevent a grand jury indictment.

The 1908 Calyx said of White, ‘‘Admiration
of her is stamped forever on our minds; love for
her is seated deep in our hearts; respect for her is
impressed indelibly on our souls.”’

The library system, which went on line during
Thanksgiving break, cost about $600,000, including
the cost of bar-coding every book, Brown said. The
catalog allows students to search for books by
author, title, subject or keyword.

  

students were suspects in the
increased crime ‘“‘came as 4a
surprise.’’

‘It is an issue students should
be aware of,’ Howison said. ‘‘I
think we should consider the scope of
the problem and how [seldom] it
refers to W&L. But I also want to
remind students to honor the Honor
System. W&L is a partner with the
community.’’

Howison stressecd that the
Honor Code does apply to student
actions in the city of Lexington.

Herrick said the shoplifting
signs, made by the LDDA, were
distributed to approximately 30 local
business representatives who attended
the association’s shoplifting workshop
on Nov. 21.

The Lexington Chamber of
Commerce and the LDDA sponsored
the shoplifting workshop, where the
business representatives watched a
video produced by the Small Business
Advancement Institute.

‘“‘We heard that various
shopkeepers were starting to feel the
effects of shoplifting and we wanted
to find ways to prevent it from
happening,’’ Herrick said.

The video addressed several
issues, including how to prosecute a
shoplifting case and what to do to
make shoplifting more difficult.

‘The business owners] were
very receptive to the information,”
Herrick said. ‘‘Many felt it was very
helpful.

‘‘One of the points we feel is a
deterrent to crime is publicity, talking
to the media. We publicize when
good things are happening. We also
need to let people know when bad
things happen.”’

Herrick said she feels people
do not realize the effect stealing has
on business owners in a closely-knit
community.

‘*Some of the owners do take it
personally,’’ Herrick said. ‘“‘It does
hurt when someone takes something;
not only because the prices must go
up, but also because the owners care
a lot about their stores.”’

  

 

White

Brown said the circulation system will be
automated by March. Students will check books
out with the university card and be able to tell by
computer whether books are checked out.

Brown said the library also plans to add
periodical holdings and books on order to the
catalog in the summer.

W&L AT WAR!

 W&LIFE |

The Ring-tum Phi, January 9, 1992

 

50 years ago this week, students returned after break
to find their school and their lives turned upside down

 

By JASON KELLEY
Phi Editor

 

It is January 1942,

The United States has been at
war with the Empire of Japan and
Hitler’s Third Reich for one month.

The Ring-tum Phi reports, ‘‘after
23 years and eight months of uneasy
peace another generation of
Washington and Lee students — like
those of 1776, 1812, 1840, 1861,
1898, and 1917 — realize the historic
significance’’ of their own era.

As 895 men return to begin the
winter semester, there is a sense that
WA&L has changed and will never be
quite the same again.

Gone are the dances for which
the school was famed. Road trips
have been abolished to save gasoline
and tires. The football team will not
take the field again until the fall of
1946. Students are checking with
their draft boards to see what their
status with the armed forces is.

Today, fifty years later, there
are only a scant few men left in
Lexington who were part of that
group of 895 who returned to find
their world and their school tumed
upside down.

Ewing Humphreys, °44, is one
of them.

Humphreys came to W&L as a

freshman in the fall of 1940,
following in his father and
grandfather’s footsteps.

‘*When Pearl Harbor happened,
it changed all of our lives,’’ he said.
“‘T was riding to see my girlfriend at
Hollins and we stopped to get a Coke
and the news was being broadcast on
the radio. We were stunned.”’

Humphreys said in January of

1942 he went to Portsmouth to join
the Marines. The commanding officer
swore him into the reserves and told
him to go back to school.

‘*He said they’d call me when I
was needed, and he said they might
make me an officer,’’ Humphreys
said.

Humphreys spent about a year
back at W&L before he was called to
active duty.

Enrollment at the school
plummeted from 941 in February of
1941 to only 97 students by the fall
of 1944,

According to a 1943 Phi article,
WA&L lost a larger percentage of its
student body to the armed forced than
any other college in the United States.
In the eight months of the 1942-1943
academic year, fully two-thirds of the
students left to fight.

Humphreys said he was the only
one left to close up the Phi Delta
Theta house in 1943.

‘I was eating at the Beta house
and there were army officers living in
some of the other fraternities,’’ he
said.

 

‘Washington and Lee has
seen the disillusioning,
almost disastrous effects
of World War Il. She
reeled, she staggered,
but she kept on.’

 

Those army officers were on
campus to conduct the Army’s school
for personnel services which was run
at W&L from 1942 through 1946.

To make up some of the lost
tuition revenue, University trustees
rented Tucker Hall, the dining hall,

the student center and use of the gym
and athletic fields to the army to train
older enlistees to run athletic leagues
and other morale boosting programs
for troops overseas.

Humphreys said that in January
of 1943, the army ran a big recruiting
drive in Lexington, persuading about
150 W&L men to join up.

‘The army told them they could
be officers and they wouldn’t be
called up until after graduation,’’ he
said, ‘‘but they were all called up
about three weeks later and sent to
the Battle of the Bulge. A lot of those
boys were killed there.”’

The Marines called Humprheys
to active duty late in 1943, and since
he had enough credits to graduate at
the time, his diploma was sent to him
in the mail.

The few students who returned

to campus in the fall of 1944 were
welcomed by an editorial in The
Columns, a weekly publication that
stood in for the dormant Phi from
1943 through 1946:

“‘Today, Washington and Lee is
a far cry from the school in its
heyday. Little of the old life is left,
little of the social activities, little of
the sports, but the basic love of
learning and of fellowman is left.”’

Each week, The Columns’
headlines were grim reminders to
those left on campus:

“Alumni Office Reports
Koontz, Bagley Deaths”’
“Three Killed in Armed

Services Action in Germany and Iwo
Jima”’

The paper contained weekly
reports on regiments W&L men were
serving in, and recorded acts of

‘bravery and tragedy.

“Herbert Grooms Smith, Jr.,
2nd Lieutenant in the Marine
Corps...a graduate of the class of
1943 and a member of Pi Kappa
Alpha...was shot in the chest and died
almost immediately. His body was
found after a week of searching and
buried at the Third Marine Division
cemetery on Iwo Jima,’’ the paper
reported in 1943,

After the Japanese Navy and Air
Force attacked the Pacific Fleet in
Pearl Harbor and the U.S. declared
war on the Axis powers, the Librarian
of Congress got nervous about the
safety of Washington D.C. and asked
that historic documents from the
national archives be moved out of the
city.

the Commerce School) was one of
five depositories that secretly held
original copies of the Declaration of
Independence, the Constitution, and
an original of the Magna Carta that
Britain had sent to the U.S. for
safekeeping. Four military guards
were on duty in the library 24 hours
a day to protect the documents.

Before Phi editor Ed Jackson
left for the service in 1943 he wrote
of the mood present at W&L at the
time:

“Washington and Lee has seen
the disillusioning, almost disastrous
effects of World War II. She reeled,
she staggered, but she kept on.”’

Humphreys went on to serve as
a second lieutenant in the Marines
and saw action in the Pacific Theater.

He said after the war, all those
who had received their degrees in
absentia like he had were invited back
to participate in the graduation
ceremony in June of 1946.

“That night we were all
together again singing and drinking,”’
he said. ‘‘In the moming everyone
went their own separate ways.’’

Humphreys said although the
war changed W&L in a lot of ways,
there is one thing he thinks nothing
can change about the school.

“The thing that has never
changed is the love the students have
for their school,’’ he said. ‘‘Even in
the face of all this PC stuff and after
the liberal decades, the students keep
their love for their school alive.

‘That distinction has belonged
to the student body. The faculty and
administration never had it. That

special mystique and honor, that
alone belongs to the students, just like
it always has.”’

Panati, author of Extraordinary Origins of Everyday Things. Back then,
the ancient Babylonians swore they were going to start off the new year
right. They made resolutions such as these two most common: paying off
outstanding debts, and returning all borrowed farm equipment.

Nowadays, modern Americans still hold fast to this time honored
tradition, though what we hope to achieve at this new beginning varies
somewhat from our Babylonian forbearers. You may ask what the most
common contemporary resolutions are? To go on a diet and/or to quit

On Campus some of the most common resolutions being made (and
most likely broken) are: to run every day, to lose ten pounds, to get
better grades, and to be more tolerant. No one was willing to go on the
record, however, in order to protect the privacy of their own bad habits.
Most students, are content with their lives as is, and have decided to pass
up resolution making for 1992.

From Payne

in search of the elusive A

 

By JOSHUA MANNING
Phi Staff Reporter

Continuing a Washington and Lee trend, last term’s
student grade point average rose to 2.93, almost a solid B,
but that’s only part of the story.

“We are awarding a greater percentage of A’s and
B’s,’’ University Registrar Scott Dittman said. ‘‘That is
reflected in the average student GPA.”’

The 1991-92 Registrar’s Report, released over break,
highlighted the fact that over 70 percent of the grades
awarded were either A’s or B’s. Failing grades dropped to
a 28-year low of 1.6 percent.

In the grade distribution breakdown for the 1990-91
academic year, the music and theater departments topped
the list of most A-range grades — A-plus, A, or A-minus

— awarded with 67 and 55 percent, respectively. Other
disciplines with top-heavy grade distributions included
military science, physical education, Greek, Chinese, art
and biology.

Greek also lead the list of most failing grades with
5.9 percent. Other disciplines with high failure rates
include mathematics and Latin.

While the distribution of grades by department
remains generally constant over the years, Dittman said
larger departments, such as English, would tend to have
more median grades, while smaller departments, such as
Greek, Latin and Chinese, would show a more erratic
distribution.

The numbers agreed. The English department
awarded the fewest A-range grades — 18 percent. The
Commerce School trio of administration, economics and
politics followed suit.

English Professor James Warren was surprised by
the distribution.

“*T would have thought that some of the departments
known for being difficult would have been lowest,’
Warren said. ‘‘One interpretation of this could be because
the English department places so much of an emphasis on
writing. Getting a superior grade on an essay is more dif-
ficult than on a mathematics or economics exam, for ex-
ample.”’

Warren, who has never given a final grade of A-
plus, believes his personal grade distribution of just below
3.0 is pretty close to the overall department average.

““It’s not easy to get an A, but anyone ought to be
able to get a B,’’ Warren said.

While the music department’s top-heavy grade dis-
tribution may have been affected by the large number of
students in the music ensembles, Music Professor

Where the A’s are

Departments you’re most likely to get an A In:

Music: 68.5%

 

Theatre: 55.2%

Chinese: 51.7%

Departments you’re least likely to get an A in:

English: 18.6%

Economics: 20.3%

Administration: 20.4%

Figures are percentage of total grades given
that were in the A-plus to A-minus range.

Margaret Brouwer said it’s pretty hard to get an A in the
academic courses.

Brouwer, who grades most of her courses on a
straight curve, does not remember ever giving an A-plus
in an academic course.

The current grading system has been in place since
1983 when the plus and minus system was introduced,
Dittman said. Despite questions about the viability of the
A-plus grade, a survey a few years ago failed to find a
strong faculty preference either way.

“There are still people who don’t like to use it,”’
Dittman said. ‘‘As far as I’m concerned, A-plus should
only be given out in extremely unusual circumstances.”’

Theater Professor Albert Gordon said many of the
high grades in that department come in practical and
studio performance courses. Grades in these courses are
based on improvement and commitment, Gordon said.

Although Gordon hesitates to give out an A-plus
grade, his department leads the university in the category
with 12.8 percent.

Twelve o’clock and all is well
with the Co-op’s extended hours.

The Co-op remained open an
extra hour during weeknights for a
trial period during fall term.

‘The students are satisfied with
the hours so we are keeping them,”’
said Snack Bar Manager Donald
Burch.

Co-op Student Manager Marcy
Brown said that between 11 p.m. and
12 midnight only bagels and grilled
cheese sandwiches will be offered
from the grill.

A survey of Co-op customers
showed the grilled cheese to be the
most popular item after 8 p.m.

“‘Because of its popularity, we
will have a grill on the sandwich bar
that will make four sandwiches at
once,” Burch said.

Sophomore Aimee Wood said
the extra hour each night provides
motivation to study.

“I can get a boost of energy by
taking a Co-op break,’’ Wood said.

carefully during Rush week, and
rushees must share the responsibility
for obeying no-contact rules.

“‘T think all sororities have done
a good, job trying to protect

burden is really going to be falling on
the freshmen women. If they go out,
they'll be putting themselves in

Meanwhile, some of Pi Phi’s

Slow W&L’s Brown

 

By SEAN O’ROURKE
Phi Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
men’s swimming team opened up the
Second part of their season last
Saturday with a 123-82 loss to a
tough College of Charleston team.

The meet was W&L’s first
since their triumph over VMI prior to
Christmas break. Despite the loss,
Coach Page Remillard was pleased
with his team’s performance.

 

 

Soderberg
paces W&L

By JACOB KIMBALL
Phi Staff Reporter

On December 6, 1991, in
only their second tournament of
the season, the Washington and
Lee wrestlers competed in the
Lebanon Valley Tournament.

The field consisted 20
teams and included some of the
top Division II wrestling
programs on the East Coast.
W&L finished 18th overall and
had some strong individual
performances.

Senior co-captain Peer
Soderberg won his first two
matches in the 167-pound
weight class. He advanced to
the quarterfinals, only to fall 4-0
to Anthony Spagnola of
Moravian.

Joining Soderberg in the
quarterfinals were freshman
Adam Williams and junior 190-
pounder John Conkling.
Williams advanced by upsetting
fourth seeded Todd Rupp of
Lebanon Valley 11-7 but fell in
the quarterfinals as did Conkling
after he recorded his team high
second pin of the season against
Tim Ayers of Albright.

The Generals return to
the mat after a long layoff on
January 11 in the Davidson
Quadrangular against Davidson,
Greensboro, and Anderson.

 

 

 

 

 

‘“‘We swam real well,’’
Remillard said. ‘‘In essence, we
equaled first term times, which is a
significant accomplishment
considering how hard we worked over
the last 10 days or so.”’

The hard work will pay off,
Remillard said.

“You'll see times improve
because we have the kids following a
system that will help them peak at the
right time.”’

The right time for senior Doug
Brown seems to be every time he
dives in the pool. He posted another
three win-meet against Charleston, the
only General to post a win. It was the
third straight meet in which Brown
has won three times. He captured the
500-yard freestyle, the 200-yard
freestyle and the 200-yard butterfly.

‘Doug swam real well,’’ said
Remillard. ‘“The team as a whole,
though, is in good shape. The
disruption in the season is a little

hard, but we used the break well and
I believe the kids will hit their peaks
at the end of the season in the
championship meets.”’

The layoff wasn’t long enough
to cool Brown down.

‘‘The layoff wasn’t that long.
We’ve been back training pretty hard
and we’re in good shape,’’ said
Brown. ‘‘We expect to peak just
before the championship meets and in
the past we've had over 90 percent of
our guys swim there best times,’’ he
added.

Remillard, despite the loss, is
confident in his team’s attitude.

“Our kids have what every
championship team has, an upbeat
and focused attitude. They believe in
themselves and each other. Once they
get into the competitive phase of our
plan, they will definitely see times
getting consistently better,’’ Remillard
said.

Right now, Remillard’s biggest
fear is the outbreak of the flu. He
says that with everyone coming back,
and many of them sick, he fears his
team will fall prey to the epidemic.

Flu or not, the Generals must Senior Jodi Herring also had her best

Marlins end Generals’ streak

 

By JAY PLOTKIN
Phi Sports Editor

 

After shooting well over 50
percent in winning the Washington
and Lee Invitational over the
weekend, the W&L basketball team
found out what life is like when the
ball doesn’t bounce the right way.

The Generals led Virginia
Wesleyan 27-26 at halftime in
Wednesday night’s game in the
Warner Center after shooting 52
percent in the first half. But W&L
went cold in the second half,
shooting just 35 percent, and the
Marlins were able to come back for
a 64-56 win. W&L shot 42 percent
for the game.

The loss was frustrating for
head coach Verne Canfield.

‘‘We didn’t get beat, we
lost,’’ he said. ‘‘We didn’t shoot
well because we didn’t work our
offense and we didn’t establish an
inside game.”’

Without an inside game, the
Generals were forced to rely on
outside shooting. Junior Bryan
Watkins’ hot hand turned cold in the
second half. Watkins led the way for
W&L with 16 points, but scored just
four after intermission on two of 11
shooting.

Freshman John Rogers
showed the hot hand, scoring 13
points (a career high) on five of
seven shooting and two three point
shots.

Rogers scored four straight
points midway through the second
half to give the Generals a 42-41
lead, but that was the last time the
Generals led. Rick Chalk scored 14
of his game-high 18 points and
grabbed 11 of his game-high 13
rebounds in the second half to lead

the Marlins to the win.

“‘We had a great first half,
and we were nip and tuck with them
in the second half,’’ said Canfield.
“‘Then we missed some shots and
had to go for the bali at the end.”’

W&L rallied late and forced
some turnovers (18 on the night),
but couldn’t make the shots fall to
catch the Marlins. A Rogers three-
point shot brought the Generals
within four at 56-52 with 1:11 left,
but Chalk made six free throws in
the final minute to ice the win.

“‘I can remember three times
where three-point shots went around
the rim and came back out,”’ said
Canfield. ‘‘That will happen. We
got disheartened when it happened,
and we can’t do that. When that
happens, we need to really work the

Watkins leads

General
tourney

By JAY PLOTKIN
Phi Sports Editor

One game does not a career
make, but that one game sure can
help turn a season around.

Last weekend in the Washington
and Lee Invitational, the Generals got
career highs from two players on
back-to-back nights and won the
tournament, beating Bowdoin on
Friday and Colorado College on
Saturday.

“We finally put some things
together,”’ said head coach Verne
Canfield. ‘‘We’ve been urging the
kids to succeed, and we did.”’

On Friday, junior guard Bryan
Watkins emerged from a season-long
shooting slump to score a career-high
25 points on nine-of-14 shooting,
including four three-point goals and
sophomore Robert Miggins added
career-highs in points (14) and
rebounds (13) as the Generals topped
Bowdoin’s Polar Bears 77-67.

 

 

   

 

 

Bowdoin led 22-21 with 7:51 left
in the first half, but Watkins scored
eight of his 17 first-half points in a
row and found Miggins for a basket
as the Generals reeled off an

11-2 run to take control of the game
and lead 39-32 at the half.

In the second half, W&L opened
up a 15-point lead on_ several
occasions and held off a late Bowdoin
rally for the win.

W&L shot 56.8 percent for the
game, the first time all season the
Generals had shot better than 43
percent.

““We worked on our shooting
more during the break,’’ said
Canfield, ‘‘and it paid off. It is
something we will continue to work
hard on it.”’

On Saturday, the Generals
continued their hot streak from the
field against a Colorado College team
that brought a nine-game winning
streak onto the floor. The Generals
also got career-high performances
from two other players to aid the
cause.

The Generals quickly jumped out
to a 7-0 lead on baskets by senior
Mark Melton, a three-pointer from
Watkins and sophomore Paul Baker.
Colorado came back to take a brief
lead at 19-18, but the Generals
opened up a seven-point halftime

lead. Watkins was the leader again,
scoring 14 points in the half, and the
Generals shot 64 percent.

 

 

 

 

Miggins

In the second half, Melton took
over the game. His basket started the
Generals on a 14-6 mn_ before
Colorado began bombing away at the
lead. The Tigers hit seven second half
three-pointers forcing head coach
Verne Canfield to use four time outs.

But each time Canfield called a
time out, W&L responded with a
basket. After one time out sophomore
Bryant Pless hit two free throws to
start a 6-0 run to force a Colorado
time out. Melton scored immediately
after another time out to push the lead
back up to 55-45.

Colorado got within one point at
79-78, but junior Bryan Brading
rebounded a missed three point shot
and made both free throws after being
fouled with 16 seconds left, and
Baker iced the game with two more
foul shots with three seconds left to
preserve the 83-78 win.

““We beat a team that was clearly
better than we were,”’ said Canfield.
“Everyone did his part. Mark
[Melton] took the ball to the hole and
scored. Watkins penetrated well and
hit his three point shots. Our two
point guards [Brading and sophomore
Matt Newton] had just two turnovers
between them. That’s terrific.”’

Melton scored 14 second half
points on six-of-six shooting and a
career-high 20 on the night on nine-
of-10 shooting and Baker added 12
points and eight rebounds, both career
highs in the win. Watkins finished
with 18 points.

While Melton and Watkins led the
way, everyone contributed.

“‘Miggins is coming on,’’ said
Canfield. ‘‘He’s getting a lot of
deflections. [Sophomore Bryant] Pless
(nine points vs. Colorado) and
Newton didn’t dress last year, but
they stuck it out and both contributed
some big plays down the stretch.”’

The two wins upped the Generals’
record to 3-6 on the season.

Watkins scored 43 points on 17 of
27 (63 percent) shooting to earn
tournament Most Valuable Player
honors. He came into the tournament
shooting a paltry 34.6 percent from
the field. Melton was also named to
the All-Tournament team.

Division gap too wide for women’s swimming to bridge

 

By ERIN MCKINNEY

The Washington and Lee
women’s swimming team returned to
the pool after a long lay-off and was
rudely splashed in the face.

The Generals got a taste of the
difference between Division III

swimming and Division I swimming
when the College of Charleston
flexed its Division I muscle by
topped the Generals 143-39 last
Saturday.

Coach Kiki Jacobs thought her
team swam well, all things
considered. The team entered the
meet fresh off a week of intense

training.

“‘The team swam really well,”’
Jacobs said. ‘‘Most of the team
remained at their [early-season] times
or were a little bit better.’’

Junior Claire Dudley won top
honors for the Generals. She came in
second in both the 200-yard
individual medley and the 500-yard

freestyle. Against the Division I
opponent, Dudley’s season best times
weren’t enough to win.

Sophomore Kari May swam
her season’s best time in the 1000-
yard freesytle, the 200-yard individual
medley and the 200-yard backstroke.
