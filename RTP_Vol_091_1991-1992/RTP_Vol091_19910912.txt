LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

SEPTEMBER 12, 1991

Religion professor Rogers dies of cancer at 61

By Sarah Drain and Courtney Hall
Of The Ring-tum Phi Staff

 

A memorial service for Washington and Lee
professor Minor Rogers will be held Sept. 17 at
noon in Lee Chapel.

Rogers, who taught religion and specialized
in East Asian studies, died August 25 at the
Columbia Medical Center in New York City.

He was 61.

neurologist at Columbia University.

Born in London, Rogers came to Lexington
in 1948 when he entered Virginia Military
Institute. During his Army service in the
Korean War, Rogers first encountered Japanese
culture, a subject which became the focus of
much of his later professional work.

In 1958, Rogers was ordained an Episcopal
priest at the Virginia Theological Seminary. He
served as a missionary in Kyushu, Japan, from
1961 to 1965.

Rogers received his doctorate from Harvard
University’s Center for the Study of World

the Washington and Lee faculty as an assistant
professor. He served as head of the religion
department from 1984 to 1989. :

Rogers helped develop W&L’s East Asian
department, which includes an exchange
program with Rikkyo University in Tokyo and
Kansai University of Foreign Studies in
Hirakata, Japan.

Rogers was the author of many journal
articles and papers on Japanese Buddhism; he
presented several of them at national and
international academic meetings. Fluent in
Japanese, Rogers translated many Japanese

Rogers’ wife, Ann Tutwiler Rogers, is an
instructor in Japanese at W&L.

“Those of us who studied Asian religion
with Professor Rogers were often impressed
with the eccentric reverence he always brought
to the conversations,’’ remernbers Jason
Robertson, a Rogers advisee.

‘*He would often stop thoughtfully when a
student made a_ particularly _ insightful
comment,’’ Robertson continued. ‘‘A smile
would come across his face and the realization
that the Buddha and Wheel of Samsara were
also real and alive in his students.

Rogers suffered complications from
widespread cancer that was diagnosed in early
July, said his son, John D. Rogers, a

Program
cut for
freshmen

By Jennifer Gibson

The class of 1995 ends its Ori-
entation Program Sunday, just one
week after international Asian stu-
dents completed a Preorientation
Program very different than in years
past.

“We didn’t have the program in
a traditional sense,’’ Associate Dean
of students Anece McCloud said.

In Preorientation, a group of
freshmen representing diverse geo-
graphic, ethnic and racial back-
grounds are brought together a week
before Freshman Orientation to help
them become accustomed to W&L
and Lexington, McCloud said.

‘We invited blacks and other
minorities, all international students,
both exchange and four-year, and
whites from areas not well-represen-
ted in the student body,’’ McCloud
said of the program in past years.

Minority Student Association
President Rita Poindexter _ap-
preciated béing included in Preorien-
tation her freshman year.

‘It’s not easy to be a minority
here,’’ Poindexter said. With Preori-
entation, “‘you have someone to
bond with. When the flock comes
in, it’s easier if you have someone
to share your experience.’’

But last year the program grew
to almost 40 freshmen.

“*Preorientation was getting too
big and causing a lack of continuity
in the freshman class,’’ Dean of
Students David Howison said,

With athletes included, ap-
proximately 60 freshmen arrived
early, creating logistical problems
for the university, McCloud said.

Howison proposed to discon-
tinue the program on a trial basis
this year. But Professor Harold Hill
of the East Asian studies department
still saw a need for Preorientation
for international Asian students.

 

“They have a greater language

and cultural problem in adjusting
here, both living in the U.S, and at
a university,’’ Hill said.
International Club President
Hui-chu Mou agreed with Hill on
the issue of Asian students, but has
reservations about the need for
Preorientation for black students,
“T think it’s good for the
Asian students, because they get
more attention,’’ Mou said. ‘‘The

black students, they are American. I
don't think they need any help in
opening bank accounts and getting
P.O. boxes.”’

The Asian students who at-
tended this year’s Preorientation
were glad for their early arrival. But
they said they would have liked
more interaction with American
students.

Diver
dies at
falls

By Jennifer Mayo
Staff Reporter

 

 

One last dive ended in a fatal
accident for a 21-year-old Falls
Church, Virginia woman at Panther
Falls last summer.

James Madison University student
Larkin Smith and her friends were
preparing to leave Panther Falls on
the afternoon of June 5 when Larkin
said she wanted to take one more
dive. Smith plunged into submerged
rock, cutting her head and breaking
her neck on impact. She died four
days later.

Smith and her friends had been
jumping and diving off the rocks all
afternoon, said Katrina Miller, another
JMU student and friend of Smith’s.
Bul when she dove from the rock to

ver's dark waters.

Washington and Lee graduate
John McManus, ‘91, and his family
were at the falls when Smith was
injured,

“T saw this one girl doing a lot
of dives," McManus said of Smith
‘*She tried to do a pike, and I guess
she didn’t get out far enough, be
cause she hit a rock and floated to
the top, She was tuming blue, and
we tried to give her CPR, but she
wasn't breathing.’

McManus’ brother Tim pulled

carried her a mile through the woods
and rocky terrain to the parking lot.

“Tim, a guy from JMU, and |
carried her up the trail over rocks
and roots,"’ McManus said. ‘‘It took
us about 10° minutes; we were
running as fast as we could.”’

From the parking lot, John drove
ten winding miles down the mountain
on U.S. Route 60 to Buena Vista,
because none of the JMU students
knew the way to Buena Vista or
Lexington.

“IT was really scared because the
cut on her head was so deep,”
McManus said. ‘‘We could see into
her head, but I concentrated on driv

 

Sigma Chi and Sigma Phi Epsilon
will move to two new fraternity
houses to be built in Davidson Park,
according to new university plans.

‘“We are serving everybody’s best
interests in building the new houses,”’
said Coordinator of Capital Planning
Frank Parsons.

While architects complete their
drawings for these two houses and
the rest of Fraternity Renaissance
Phase III, work on the program’s
Phase II houses is being completed.
Also, some minor work is being done
on the previously-completed Phase I
houses.

Parsons explained even if the
current house Sigma Chi occupies
were renovated, it would still not be
able to have a separate party facility,
meaning the dining room would have
to serve ‘‘double duty.’’

“IT think it’s unfortunate that
we're losing our prime location, but
it is in the best interest of the chap-
ter,’’ Sigma Chi President Charles
Edwards said.

Parsons also said that in the
course of renovating the current
house, the number of members able
to live in Sigma Chi would actually
drop from 15 to 12.

He said the cost of building a
new house in Davidson Park will
probably be equal to or less than the
cost that would have been incurred
attempting to renovate the current
house.

According to Parsons, the current
structure will be renovated and most
likely used by the university’s De-
velopment Office.

SPE will get a new house for a
number of reasons, Parsons said.

First, Parsons said, the estimated
cost of renovating the SPE house is
about one million dollars.

“The cost is far more than we
should spend on renovating one
house,’’ he said.

Another reason, according to
Parsons, is the opposition the univer-
sity would expect to encounter in
obtaining a zoning permit from the
city before any work could be done.

Because SPE is in a residential
area, it is one of the few houses on
campus that would need to obtain a
conditional use permit if it were to
be renovated.

Parsons said that since SPE has
had ‘‘problems with its neighbors on
both sides,’’ enough opposition might
be raised so that the request for a
permit would be denied by the city.

Parsons said the university might
sell the current SPE house or might
renovate it so it can be used as hous-
ing for visiting faculty.

Parsons said the university will
submit the site plan for the two new
Davidson Park houses to the city
planning commission this week. If all
goes well, he said, construction could
begin in January and members could
move into the houses in January
1993,

Meanwhile, work is almost com-
plete on some of the Phase II houses
and planning has begun for Phase III.

Parsons said workers are finishing
up the basement of Lambda Chi
Alpha and that members, who are
already living in the house, will be
able to use the basement in time for
Fraternity Rush.

“The university and the contrac-
tors have been extremely coopera-
tive,’’ Lambda Chi President Shane
Kimzey said. ‘‘They assure us the
basement will be done in time for
Rush, or they will work around our
schedule,”’

The house being renovated for
Kappa Sigma should be completed by
mid-September, Parsons said, and

Where’s the party?

Hollins students vote to curtail traditional fest

 

By Jason Kelley
Editor

 

 

“Last year, you couldn't even walk here,’ the fresh-
man heard the upperclassman say as he pointed to the
street between the second and third rows of apartments.
“This is nothing like it used to be.’’

The upperclassman was right. The traditional day
before-classes-party at the Hollins College Apartments
Tuesday night was nothing like it used to be

‘We used to get about 1500-1600 people at the
party,’’ said Hollins Director of Security Robert O. Wills.
“This year I'd estimate there were only about 400-450

people in the apartments.’

According to Christine Knight, Hollins Coordinator of
Special Events, the school’s student leadership last year
decided they wanted to diminish the size of the apartment
parties because of the risks involved with mass, public

drinking,

“Last spring,’’ Knight said, ‘‘the student leaders
proposed to the student body in a ‘town meeting’ that
they all try to downsize the parties, and the students

voted to approve it.”’

Knight said the possible loss of the school’s liquor
license was also a consideration for the students.

threatened the school with loss of its license. He added,
though, that a new agent had taken charge of the Roa-
noke office since the last apartment parties were held.

Wills said Hollins’ security had to intervene in only

a few incidents during the parties.

is for everyone

The arrival of the class of 1995 might mark the
beginning of a new era of cohesiveness in the Wash-
ington and Lee community. This step forward is
attributable not so much to the Freshman Orientation
Program as to the trial elimination of a program
called Preorientation.

Few people know about Preorientation, though it
has gone on for years. Minority students, including
black and international students, as well as American
students from areas infrequently represented in
W&L’s student body, all arrived in Lexington one
week prior to their freshman classmates. They par-
ticipated in activities like those of regular Orientation,
including icebreakers and academic prep seminars.
The students also received optional guidance in open-
ing bank accounts and getting post office boxes.

The immediate result of the program seemed posi-
tive. The students had fun. They got to know each
other better than they did the sea of freshmen who
arrived on move-in day. Amid the regular Orienta-
tion’s often chaotic constraints, the Preorientation
students were able to turn to each other for support.

But this year the administration cancelled Preorien-
tation, responding to the long-term effects of the
program, which were not as rosy as their short-term
counterparts. The problem was that Preorientation
worked too well.

You will never forget the first people you met at
school. If they are not your closest friends now, they
are at least people to whom you talk in the Co-op,
people with whom you like to keep in touch. So it
was for the Preorientation group; consequently, bar-
riers arose between the Preorientation students and
their freshman classmates at large. The bonding that
resulted when freshmen experienced the regular Or-
ientation Program together too often did not incor-

porate the earlier bonding of the Preorientation group.

Even more alarming is that the people who ex-
perienced that premature bonding were the same
people who needed the most help adjusting to W&L’s
conservative atmosphere. The president of the Minor-
ity Students Association said that being a minority on
this campus is not easy, and she is right. Why com-
plicate matters by isolating minorities from the start?

We applaud Dean Howison for his bold step in ex-
perimenting with a new approach to Preorientation.
Though we do agree that minorities who face the
barrier of language must be brought in early, there is
no need to divide the freshman class any further.
Preorientation, as it was handled before this year,
only contributed to the cultural and racial hurdles that
the W&L community must overcome in order to
carry our fine traditions into the 21st century.

Real diversity

True danger lies in refusing to listen to differing opinions

MY VIEW
By David Bernstein

 

‘Diversity’ is the new catch phrase of the
self-appointed campus race monitors. They demand
‘‘diversity’’ of almost every kind — race, gender,
sexual orientation, even physical ability. What these
folks won’t countenance, however, is diverse
opinions.

As a black college student at the University of
Maryland, I learned this truth the hard way. As a
black conservative, I was ostracized by the very
people who claimed to value difference because I
was, well, different. They didn’t mind that I was
black, of course, but College Park’s politically

tical to the idea of a uni-
versity education.

correct student leadership seemed to prefer ideo-
logical lockstep within their ‘‘diverse’’ student
body.

Fortunately, I was never subjected to the kind
of overt intolerance that many black conservatives
endure, but there was always a palpable disdain for
me and my views among other minority students.
One black sophomore, for example, explained to
me that ‘‘white people are putting those ideas in
your head.’’ Another of my peers wrote in the
student newspaper that black conservatives must be
‘*neutralized’’ (whatever that means). Still another
person once complained, ‘‘you just don’t under-

 

 

Wilson welcomes
students

To the Students of the University:

At the invitation of The Ring-tum Phi, I
happily take this special opportunity to welcome
you to the beginning of another academic year -
- the two hundred and forty-second in the life of
Washington and Lee University. I hope for us all
a successful year as we once again set about the
essential business of the University.

The year before us will unfold quickly and,
implausible though it may seem, will conclude all
too soon. I know you will use this precious time
well and will take up your studies with enthu-
siasm and in the confidence that your energy and
talents are sufficient to ensure the achievement
and satisfaction that surely await you.

In celebrating the beginning of a new year, I
hardly need remark that there is much here in
which to take great pleasure — not only chal-
lenging classes and demanding intellectual tasks,
but the fellowship of old friends and new ac-
quaintances, the camaraderie of a caring com-
munity, the thoughtful counsel and support of
faculty and staff, and ever so much more. Take
time in these early days of the term to appreciate
anew the beauty of this place in which you are
privileged to live and work, and give thought to
the stewardship of those whose benefactions have
made your stay here possible. This University
truly is a blessing, and gratitude forever becomes
us.

It is good to have you here. I wish for each
of you a wonderful and rewarding year.

President of the University

stand.’’ It came as no surprise then, when the
president of Maryland’s Black Student Union
refused to work with me and the other black
College Republican when we wanted to bring
conservative black speakers to campus.

Like many black college students, I found the
student leadership’s attempts to insulate me from
diverse opinions condescending and antithetical to
the idea of a university education. Black collegians
should learn to appreciate the rich heritage of
intellectual debate and dissent that has defined the
black American experience. Men like W.E.B.
DuBois, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Wash-
ington, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King, Jr.,
did not share a single set of ideas. Each came to
his own conclusions through study and honest
reflection. If any of us hope to understand the
‘“‘black thing’’ referred to by those popular t-
shirts, we must try a little study and reflection of
our own.

In 1905, W.E.B. DuBois scolded a young black
girl when he explained that, ‘‘there are, in the U.S.
today, tens of thousands of colored girls who
would be happy beyond measure to have the
chance of educating themselves that you are
neglecting.’’ He further warned her that, ‘‘ignor-
ance is a cure for nothing... every time a colored
person neglects an opportunity, it makes it more
difficult for others of the race to get such an
opportunity. Do you want to cut off the chances of
the boys and girls of tomorrow?”’

The campus diversity mongers should ponder
DuBois’ words. Each time we refuse to consider
diverse opinions, we are ‘‘neglecting an oppor-
tunity’’ to leam. Each time a minority student
leader demands ‘‘solidarity’’ from his peers, he
makes it more difficult for others of the race to get
such an opportunity. And ignoring or extinguishing
“‘western culture’’ in the curriculum is truly a cure
for nothing.

versity community about a problem we are
having in the Snack Bar. Over the years, we
have had a policy in the Snack Bar that if any
member of our community ‘‘forgot’’ their money,
we have allowed them to make a purchase, so
long as they returned, no later than the next day,
with payment.

This liberal policy, based on the Honor
System, has gotten out of hand. Every day
members of our staff observe students taking
food — candy, ice cream, and beverages —
and walking away without making any effort to
pay.

In the past, students at least used to inform
the cashier that they had forgotten their money
and asked if they could come back and pay. I
now have the impression that students genuinely
believe they don’t need money when they come
into the Snack Bar. Because of our unique Honor
System, they believe they can come, take what
they want, not tell anyone, and come back to pay
at some time convenient to them. This is not the
policy.

The policy is as follows: any person wishing
to make a purchase at the Snack Bar must do so
with his/her University Card or cash. If a situ-
ation does arise when a member of the Univer-
sity community finds that, upon arriving at the
Snack Bar, they have forgotten their wallet, they
may get in the cashier line, and leave their name
and dollar amount of the purchase with the
cashier. That person should then come back and
pay within 24 hours. | stress that this must be
the exception, not the rule.

the average American did not believe that all

Similarly, I would rather not toss aside many of
the great works of science, philosophy, and lit-

GHQ Tavern.

The Student Activities Board will continue
their ‘‘Wednesdays in the Pit’’ program again
this year. Students are reminded that the GHQ,
unlike the Pavilion, which is not licensed by the
state, does hold an ABC license that allows us to
serve beer and wine in the restaurant. Unlike the
Pavilion, the GHQ stands to lose its license to
serve beer and wine if the laws are violated.

The following rules are in effect for the GHQ
on band nights:

1, Only those 21 years of age or over may
purchase and consume alcohol.

2. Non-W&L students under 18 years of age
will not be admitted.

3. All students will be required to show two
forms of identification; a valid driver’s license
and a college I.D.

4. No pitchers will be sold on band nights,
only glasses.

5. Everyone purchasing beer will be required
to show the bartender their ‘‘legal age’’ hand
stamp.

6. Any student caught giving beer to a minor,
or any minor caught consuming beer will have
his/her W&L I.D. confiscated, be ejected for the
evening, and banned from GHQ band nights for
a month. I.D.s may be picked up the following
morning in my office in Evans Hall. Second
violations will result in banishment from GHQ
band nights for the remainder of the year, in
addition to being reported to the Student Conduct
Committee.

Remember two things: using a false LD. is a
possible honor violation, and, secondly, you do
not want to be the one responsible for causing
the University to lose its privilege of offering the
sale of beer and wine on our restaurant menu.

The message is clear. Come on down, ‘‘get
down"’, have a good time. Enjoy our expanded
alternative beverage menu. If you are 21, you
may continue to purchase your favorite cold
beverage.

Bigger battle looms

VMI has won the opening battle
over single-sex admissions, but the
U.S. Justice Department will carry on
the war.

In June, lawyers for the Virginia
Military Institute won their fight in
U.S. District Court to maintain VMI's
single-sex status. But on August 13,
U.S. Attomey General Richard
Thornburgh announced the Justice
Department will appeal Federal Judge
Jackson L. Kiser’s decision.

Kiser ruled that single-sex edu-
cation benefits men and women.

*“VMI’s single-sex status and its
distinctive educational method rep-
resent legitimate contributions to
diversity in the Virginia higher educa-
tion system, and...excluding women is
substantially related to this mission,”’
Kiser wrote.

In addition to praising VMI’s
policy, Kiser, a graduate of the then
all-male Washington and Lee Law
School, condemned the state of Vir-
ginia for its lack of a state-supported
all female school.

“‘The criticism which might be
directed toward Virginia’s higher
educational policy is not that it main-
tains VMI as an all-male institution,
but rather that it fails to maintain at
least one all-female institution,’’ Kiser
wrote.

VMI lead attorney Robert H.
Patterson Jr. expressed confidence in
the school’s chances before the Rich-
mond appeals court.

“It is regrettable that VMI will
have to spend the time and resources
that an appeal will take,’’ Patterson
told the Lexington News-Gazette in
August. ‘‘But we intend to stay to
the end, and I am optimistic that we
will prevail.”’

VMI has spent more than one
million dollars defending its admis-
sions policy, a VMI spokesman told
The News-Gazette.

ministered CPR.”’

Smith's heart was beating, but she had stopped
breathing. Once in Buena Vista, they were able to flag
down a police officer who called an ambulance. Smith
was taken to Stonewall Jackson Hospital, where the
doctors told Miller that Smith’s neck had been instantly
broken. ’

Smith was transported to Charlottesville where she
remained in a coma for three days and died early Sunday
morning.

Miller said Smith was a good diver and enjoyed
Panther Falls several times before the fatal accident.

‘People have to learn that you cannot dive there, even
if you have done it before,’’ McManus said. ‘‘The water ,
level goes up and down, and you just can’t tell where the
rocks are.’’

Kathy Hall, an information officer from the Pedlar
District Ranger’s Office said that ‘‘NO DIVING”’ signs
have been posted there before, but are often dismantled *
and used for campfires. ‘

“Diving should be prohibited there. It’s so impera-
tive. As much as I love Panther Falls, I’ll never go »
back,’’ McManus said.

A sign at Panther Falls that used to read ‘‘DANGER

Parsons said work on both of those houses has gone

Lambda Chi ‘‘let things slide’ towards the end, hence the
continuing work on the basement.

But many students doubt the Phase II houses will be
ready on time. ‘‘For anyone [involved with Phase I] to
have truly believed they would have been living in their
house by last January would have been silly, and people
who believe they will be in on time for Phase II are
being unrealistic,’’ Phi Kappa Sigma President Marc Short

Knick convicted of murder

 

From The News-Gazette

Former Lexington Police Officer
Jerry Knick was found guilty Aug. 9
of second degree murder in the shoo-
ting death of his wife.

Knick had been charged with
first-degree murder after his wife,
Lisa Vincent Knick, died Sept. 30 of
a single bullet wound to the head.

Commonwealth’s Attorney Eric
Sisler had sought a first-degree mur-
der conviction, but the jury did not
agree that the murder was premedi-
tated.

Knick remains free on bond until
his sentencing hearing Sept. 25. The
sentence for second-degree murder
can range from five to twenty years.
In its verdict, the jury recommended
a prison sentence of 10 years.

During the four-day trial, Sisler
sought to prove that Knick had plot-
ted to kill his wife. He said Knick
was having an affair and wanted Lisa

, Oui of the way.

The defense attorneys, Bernard
Natkin and David Natkin, argued that

the gun had gone off by accident.

David Natkin tried to persuade the
jury in his opening arguments that
Knick was angry at his wife because
fellow Lexington Police Officer Sgt.
A.M. ‘‘Bucky’’ Miller was at their
Battery Lane home the night of the
shooting, Sept. 29.

Miller and Knick testified that
Miller and Lisa were not having an
affair, but Knick questioned Miller’s
intentions.

While on patrol Sept. 29, Knick
arrived at his home to find the door
locked and Miller with Lisa inside.
When Knick returned again about an
hour later, Miller was still there and
left at Knick’s request.

About a minute later, Lisa was
shot; she died the next day in a Roa-
noke hospital.

The defense attorneys tried to
prove that the accident had been
caused by Lisa Knick, who apparently
grabbed the gun before she was shot.

However, prosecuting attorney
Sisler argued that Knick’s jealousy
and rage prompted the shooting.

‘‘This man is no stranger to vio-

lence,’ Sisler said, referring to tes-
timony given by-Knick’s first wife,
Deborah Gibson. Gibson said Knick
had put a gun to her head on two
separate occasions while they were
separated and threatened to kill her
and himself.

Sisler said Knick wanted to kill
Lisa so he could be with his mistress,
Cecilia Grubb. Grubb is a Stonewall
Jackson Hospital employee and was
working the night Lisa Knick was
shot.

Knick testified that he has resu-
med his relationship with Grubb since
his wife’s death.

Experts testified that Knick’s
pistol can only be fired when the
squeeze cock mechanism on the gun
was activated. Lexington Police Sgt.
Torben Pederson said pulling in the
squeeze cock, which takes 25 pounds
of pressure to activate, has to be a
deliberate effort.

Physical evidence indicated that
Lisa Knick had probably grabbed the
gun, but did not prove conclusively
how the gun went off.

Two houses break Rush rules

 

By Maureen Levey
Staff Reporter

Two fraternities received rush
wamings this week for violating
Interfraternity Council contact rules,
bringing to question the meaning of
*‘casual contact.’’

The Judicial Board of the IFC
handled the infraction, which involved
fraternity members giving freshmen
rides, Associate Dean of Students
Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins said. He
did not say which fraternities were

* involved.

‘

¢

‘

‘

Casual contact means that chapter
members may extend greetings to
freshmen, but no conversation about
fraternities or Rush may take place,
Atkins said.

Associate Dean of Students Leroy
‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins reminded fraternity
members to refrain from talking to
the freshmen.

Rules for fraternity Rush are
written in the Student Handbook.
Between now and Saturday, the ca-
sual contact rule is in full force.

One fraternity’s rush chairman,
Frank Martien, said he finds the
casual contact rule difficult to follow
while welcoming freshmen to campus.

“I think it’s extremely awkward
to just say ‘hi’ and not talk about
anything of substance,’’ Martien said.

Beginning Saturday, the casual
contact confusion will end, but frater-
nity Rush will begin with a new set
of rules to follow. More rules often
mean more ‘‘dirty rush.’’

“Dirty rush’’ involves any infr-
ingement by a fraternity to the rules
during Rush, particularly houses talk-
ing about other fraternities.

He said another type of dirty rush
involves parties hosted by women.

A woman may invite anyone to
her residence, but rush rules still
apply if more than five members of
a particular fraternity are present,
Atkins said. Freshmen should un-
derstand that open contact with a
chapter member endangers the rush
privileges of a house, he said.

Fines chapters face are usually
proportional to the severity of the
rush violations, Atkins said. Three
Rush violations result in the loss of
Rush privileges which might per-
manently harm a fraternity’s status on
campus.

Freshmen Carrie Southgate and Rachel Smith are a little too close
for comfort in their room in Davis dormitory.

Freshmen feel
squeeze in dorms

 

By Leigh Allen
Staff Reporter

 

The freshman class is larger this
year and some students are feeling
the pinch.

Dorm rooms that served as singles
last year have been converted to
doubles. Also, some rooms that were
used as lounges have been turned
back into bedrooms.

Assistant Dean of Students for
Freshmen and Residence Life Dennis
G. Manning said that there has not
been an increase in the number of
complaints from freshmen regarding
the living arangements.

“If we put two freshmen in the
most capacious double available, and
two more in a shoe box, we'd get the
same amount of whining,’’ Manning
said.

Manning added _ that the
problem was further complicated by
what he calls the ‘‘inexact science of
admissions.’’

‘*We were told to expect 410 fresh-
men. 423 actually arrived,’’ Manning
said.

Associate Director of Admissions

Julia Kozak attributes the problem to
what she calls ‘‘summer melt.’’

‘Every year we have a number of
students who for whatever reason
decide not to attend Washington and
Lee,’’ Kozak said.

Students are obligated to inform
the university on May 1 as to wheth-
er they will attend W&L. According
to Kozak, 430 students accepted
admission by May 1.

The Admissions office estimated
that 20 students would not show up.
Admissions then informed the hous-
ing office to prepare for 410 fresh-
man.

‘*For whatever reasons, our ‘su-
mmer melt’ was small this year. I
think it was a national trend,’’ Kozak
said.

Freshmen Carrie Southgate and
Rachel Smith share a room the size
of many singles, but don’t seem to
mind the close quarters.

‘The room next door is bigger
than ours and it’s a single,’’ Smith
said, refering to her room on the
second floor of Davis dorm. ‘“‘It’s
worked out well so far. A little
more room might be nice....’’

One word sums up the first few
weeks of the freshman experience:
adjustment.

The class of 1995 has spent the
past five days adjusting to new sur-
roundings, new rules, new friends and
new freedoms. Today they had their
first taste of adjusting to new aca-
demic expectations.

Washington and Lee professors
who teach introductory level courses
have some time-tested opinions on
why freshmen often find the acade-
mic adjustment particularly difficult.

“I think the biggest adjustment I
see freshmen having to make is in
the work load,’’ Assistant Professor
of Chemistry Steven Desjardins said.
“I think there are very few high
schools, public or private, who really
prepare freshmen for a college work
load. It isn’t a matter of intelligence,
it’s a matter of time management.”

Gwyn Campbell, assistant profes-
sor of Romance Languages, also
believes freshmen struggle with the
increased work load and the added
responsibility of completing work
outside of class.

“In most of our beginning level
language classes, it is the student’s
responsibility to learn and complete
grammar exercises before they come
to class,’’ she said. ‘‘That’s quite
different from high school, where
most of the learning is done in
class.’’

Assistant Professor of English
Kary Smout pointed out that a big
part of the academic adjustment from
high school to college is mental.

“Freshmen come in feeling their
writing skills are very good,’’ he
said. ‘‘They have a false sense of
complacency in the beginning and are
usually surprised when their grades
aren’t very high right at first.”’

Campbell sees another major

Tips for academic

Survival at W&L

Keep in mind that this isn’t high school. You probably won't be able to
get by with the same amount of studying you did in high school.

        
   
 

‘Try to keep things in perspective if your grades aren't as high as they
have been in the past. Everyone who made it here is a good student, but
not everyone can be the best.

*Don’t panic if you are overwhelmed at first. There are 400 other
freshmen with anxieties similar to yours.

*Keep a smile on your face and a good sense of humor.

*Do your best not to miss any classes. Absences tend to have a snowball
effect.

*Don’t fall behind in your reading or assignments. Do some work every
day to keep from getting backed up. Cramming 12 weeks into one all-
nighter before exams isn’t much fun, and it doesn’t work very well
either.

*Get to know your professors and talk to them whenever you have
problems or questions. Take advantage of the fact that the faculty at
W&L tend to have an informal open-door policy.

*Don’t be afraid to ask upperclassmen for advice. They have been
through it all before.

*Be courageous. If you have a question to ask during or outside of class,
speak up. Class participation and extra help never hurt.

eLearn to discipline yourself and prioritize. Put your study time to good
use and don’t let anything drag you away from it.

 

‘‘Most freshmen are going to undergo
some sort of crisis of self-esteem.”

Professor Marshall Jarrett of the
history department finds that fresh-
men in his classes have difficulty
delving into a deeper understanding
of the subjects they are studying.

“It’s fairly easy for a freshman to
grasp the basic facts, but it’s a lot
harder to build those facts into inter-
pretations,’’ he observed. ‘‘It’s even

harder to understand and appreciate
and empathize with the idea of his-
tory as a foreign land one visits in a
time warp.”’

Jarrett said professors have to start
slowly and patiently with beginning
students while they develop discipline
and understanding.

Campbell agreed that self-dis-
cipline, patience and organization
skills are the key ingredients incom-
ing freshmen need to develop to be

successful in the college environment.

‘The social element of college is
a very important part of the learning
experience, and it’s very hard to
adjust, organize one’s time, and get a
sense of priority,’’ she said. ‘‘Fre-
shmen need to be aware that time
management and prioritizing are skills
that will need to be practiced, be-
cause they play an important role in
one’s success from the beginning.’’

eAvoid tuming in first draft papers. Take another look at what you've
written and think about how it could be revised and improved before you
turn it in for a grade.

*Don’t be too hard on yourself. Realize there is an adjustment period.

*Relax and have fun. But, don’t forget why you’re here.

Malapropism:
A ludicrous misuse of a word

These misguided quotes were col-
lected by Journalism Professor John
Jennings from papers written by for-
mer students in Journalism 338, Con-
temporary Motion Picture.

If one has to make mistakes, they
may as well be laughable...

“‘a close-up from the waste up.’’

“These years were one of the most
historical periods in our nation’s
history.”’

“An example of this jux of posi-
tions...’’

“He catches the eye of a buxom,
red-headed wrench.”’

** «heroine addiction...”’
** «her timid manor...”’
**...forced to flea the country...’’

‘All tolled, Leni Riefenstahl acted in
nine films.’’

‘*..Gallop pole...”’
“In the climatic scene...’’

' “People will accept only those facts
| which jive with their previous be-
liefs,’’

‘Death is not a new or innovative
concept.”’

“‘As his party travelled the length
and breath of Mexico...’’

‘“‘The lack of narrative in the pro-
logue is what makes the impact quiet
build up to intense action to zero let
down or consequence.”’

‘*...must be put in respective.”’
**...good-verse-evil...”’

‘* .he cuts to shots of wrenched

fists.’’
(on Hitchcock) ‘‘..to capture our
interest in his macabre tail.’’

On November 1, 1901, twelve young men at Richmond College in
Richmond, Virginia banded together to create a new organization that
offered a fraternal experience not available at any of the existing or-
ganizations. Based on the three cardinal principles of Virtue, Dili-
gence, and Brotherly Love, their new fraternity thrived and spread
across the nation. What started with those twelve men has grown to
the largest fraternity in the nation with over 16,000 undergraduates.

Now, almost ninety years later, seventeen men on the campus of
Washington and Lee have decided it’s time to re-create the true frater-
nity experience. Fueled by a new attitude and an internal _re-
organization, Sigma Phi Epsilon is looking to the future. And, our fu-
ture holds a fraternity with the right balance between social, philanth-
ropic, and academic pursuits.

Lofty yet attainable goals have been set that will move Sigma Phi
Epsilon into a position where we will set the pace for W&L’s greek
system in the Nineties. Our National Headquarters has focused great

energy on helping us in any project we desire, while other Virginia
chapters have agreed to lend a hand. Some of our goals have already
been met, such as ridding our pledge program of the degradation of
hazing.

Now, we need a group of men who want to join a fraternity where
they can make a difference from day one. We are looking for a group
of men who are not satisfied with a one-dimensional fraternity experi-
ence. We want men who would rather stand out than simply fit in.

What does all of this mean to you? As a member of the W&L com-
munity, look for Sig Ep to provide support and leadership for campus
activities. As a member of the Lexington area, look to Sig Ep to pro-
mote and support charitable causes.

Finally, as a male going through rush, look to Sig Ep as the only
alternative choice today... and the only real choice tomorrow.

Watch out for the new Sigma Phi Epsilon.

didates to set up the likes of monster
outside hitters Mena McGowin and
Leslie Hess. Senior McGowin and
junior Hess combined fu almost 60
percent of W&L’s kills last year, and
both are poised to be Dittman’s go-
to gals this fall.

Next to McGowin and Hess are
proven performers like sophomore
Tara Burns and senior Marcy Brown,
who were third and fourth respective-
ly in kills last year.

Those letterwinners give Dittman

plenty to feel good about, but not one
of them is the setter that the Generals
will need. That special person is a
mystery, although junior B.J. League
may be just the woman to solve it.
League got a chance to show her
stuff early last season when Jay was
sidelined with injury, and the feisty
Floridian didn’t disappoint. League
came off the bench to dish out 47
assists in 10 games at the Haverford
Tournament in September. League
only saw action in nine games after

that point, so her lack of experience
will be a concern.

The Generals will have to be
strong from the beginning if they
expect to contend again. An ODAC
semifinalist each of the last two
years, W&L will be pushed to the
limits with the addition of Guilford to
the ODAC. The Quakers, along with
perennial powers Bridgewater and
Eastem Mennonite, will make the
ODAC as tough as it’s ever been.

after scoring a school record 32 goals
last season, but there may be nothing
more secure than the W&L defense
this fall. Anchored by three-time All-
ODAC and 1990 All-South sweeper
Nancy Mitchell, the Generals set a
new school record for fewest goals
allowed in a season last year. Hat-
horn would like nothing better than
more of the same in 1991.

Mitchell is back for a fourth
season patrolling the W&L defensive
zone. She will be joined by three-
year letterwinner and 1990 All-ODAC
selection Ashley Hurt. Other defen-
sive key players include striker Aspen
Yawars and fullback Allison Lewis.
both of whom started nearly every
game last year. Multi-purpose player
Ann Shaughnessy gives the Generals
a whatever-it-takes-type of player to
patrol the midfield area.

‘‘Defense will have to be a strong
part of our game,’’ Hathorn says.
‘And that’s good because that’s
where we have the most experience.
Our defense should keep us in con-

tention in all of our games.”’

That’s especially true given the
emergence of sophomore Kate Stimel-
ing as one of the league’s best goal-
keepers. Stimeling, who recorded a
school-record tying eight shutouts,
played every minute of every game
for the Generals last year and set a
school record for best goals against
average at 0.89.

With a number of interregional
contests and the always brutal ODAC
slate, the Generals will be tested
tough in 1991. Two of the best teams
in the South in Methodist and Emory
will come to Liberty Hall Field, and
Hathorn says games like those are
challenges her team is ready for.

‘‘We will run up against some
tough competition this season,’’ the
W&L coach says. ‘But we’d like to
be respected in our region as one of
the best teams, and you have to play
those teams to get there.’’

The Generals open the season
Saturday on the road with a game
against regional power Denison.

the cormerbacks. Also back is pre-
season All-American punter Bob
Ehret.

‘*We knew our defense was going
to be our strong suit, and it has
been,’’ said Fallon. ‘‘The front seven
are playing pretty good football.
We've got some new faces in the
secondary, but we’re pleased with
what they’ve shown us.”’

Falion’s hope is that the team will
not beat itself. The opponents will be

tough enough to beat. ‘We can’t
give away chances against any of the
teams we play, especially not in the
opener.”’

The Generals open Saturday at
Emory and Henry, the pre-season
favorite to win the ODAC. ‘‘We’ll
have to play our best game coming
off the preseason. We’re as green as
we can be offensively, and we're
hoping the defense will keep us hang-
ing tough.”’

efense to lead football in 1991

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

In 1990, Washington and Lee
head football coach Gary Fallon came
into the preseason with a monster
hole to fill. He needed to find a
quarterback to replace two school
record setters on a team where the
only player to throw a pass in a
game was the tailback.

After going 5-5 last season, Fallon
has more, and bigger, holes to fill in
1991, most of them on offense. In
the season opener Saturday at Emory
and Henry, only four offensive play-
ers will be starting at a position they
played last year.

Senior Fred Renneker is back to
run the team at quarterback, and
classmates Jeff Kreis and Jim Henry
are back to catch passes and block,
respectively, and junior Mark Goglia
will again hold down the fullback
position.

To try and fill the void left by
All-American split end Craig Irons,
Fallon had senior George Sakin move
from quarterback, where he started
five games last year, to split end.
Junior Josh Levinson returns as the
tight end, where he was a part-time

After four years as team MVP
and over 1,400 assists, the Lisa Jay
era in Washington and Lee volleyball
is Over.

Jay, who dished out nearly every
assist W&L had in the last three
years, leaves a gaping hole in her
position on the floor. Head coach
Susan Dittman knows she will have
to find a way to fill that spot, but
she also knows that if she does, she
can expect the Generals again to be

starter last season.

After two years as the backup,
junior Wade Robinett will look to fill
the shoes of workhorse tailback
Mason Pope, who was the team’s
leading scorer for three straight years.

While there were big holes to fill
in the backfield and at split end, they
pale in comparison to the holes on
the offensive line. Henry is the only
returning player who saw significant
playing time.

Henry will be joined on the line
by sophomores Derek Boggs and
John Surface, juniors Sean Gatewood
and Evans Edwards, who played all
of last season as a hard-hitting line-
backer.

As many holes as there are offen-
sively, defensively, the Generals may
be as good as they have been in
Fallon’s 13 previous years.

Nine starters return, including

last year.

From W&L Sports Information

 

After winning the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference title in 1989, the
Washington and Lee men’s soccer
team slipped in 1990, finishing below
500 and below just about every-
body’s expectations. But looking at
things from a 1991 perspective, last
year’s rough campaign may end up
being just as important if not more so
than the success of 1989.

‘I think we’re going to approach
this season as a team that has ma-
tured considerably from a _ season
where we performed below our ex-
pectations,’” says 1Sth-year head
coach Rolf Piranian, ‘‘I think we
have some mature upperclassmen, and
we'll be able to combine that with
real, solid freshman class. I’m look-

returns punts. Lyle Smith, who made
69 of his 77 tackles in the last five
games of the season will play along-
side Cox.

The only losses on defense came

ing forward to it.”’

There wasn’t much to look for-
ward during the trials and tribulations
of last year’s 7-8-2 season. W&L
won just twice in its first eight out-
ings last season, and then, just when
things turned a corner, the Generals
suffered a pair of overtime conference
losses.

Of course, there are some posi-
tives that he won’t have to look too
hard to find. First of all, four all-
conference picks from last year return
to this year’s team. Juniors Reid
Murphy, W&L’s leading scorer last
year, and Greg Williams, the league’s
preeminent sweeperback, won first-
team All-ODAC honors last year.
They will be the foundations upon
which Piranian will build his offense
and defense, respectively.

The Generals also have junior

in the secondary, where safeties Clark
Wight and Brad Miller graduated. To
take their places, Jon Omdorff will
move from backup linebacker to
starting strong safety, and Donald

Mike Mitchem and senior Dave
Hooker returning after earning
second-team all-league honors last
year. Hooker, Mitchem and soph-
omore Dan Rhodes, who was second
on the team in goals, should give
W&L its offensive spark for 1991.
The threesome are the core of the
Generals’ strong midfield unit that
also includes veterans Bobby Weis-
gerber and Winthrop Allen and soph-
omore Mike Hill.

It is up front where Piranian’s
worries begin. Murphy was the Gen-
erals’ marquee player last year, but
without a running mate for the
talented third-year starter, W&L will
have a hard time challenging for a
title.

In 1990, the Washington and Lee
women’s soccer team set 11 school ,

| records, including most wins, and
|| advanced to the final game of the ©

Old Dominion Athletic Conference ,
tournament.

Head coach Janine Hathorn played *
a young team last season, and this
may be the year she reaps the re-
wards of youth. W&L returns all 11 °
starters and a total of 23 letterwin- ,
ners. The prognosis for 1991 is good,
maybe even very good when you
consider that last year’s squad came
just penalty kicks short of winning its
first ODAC title last year. ,

It all has Hathorn more than a
little bit excited and just a little bit
concerned. Suddenly, there’s a lot at
stake for women’s soccer at W&L.
It’s kind of nice, but it’s kind of '
scary, too. ;

‘‘There is pressure based on what
we did last year,’’ Hathorn says as

defense. But his presence may be the
only familiar sight back there as
Piranian promises a ‘‘major restruc-
turing’’ in the Generals’ defense.
Whatever happens, expect senior Jeff
Zieger and juniors Chase Davis and
Kyle Fanning to battle for playing
time. Defense is crucial, Piranian
affirms.

And the annual question mark for
Piranian again is at keeper. Lee Cor-
bin and Mike Steinbrook shared time
last year, and while together they
stopped 83 percent of the shots on
goal they faced last year, neither
provided the consistency Piranian
wanted.

‘“We had too much of a Jekyil-
and-Hyde situation last year,’’ the

W&L coach says. ‘‘Each of them

don’t want to fall flat on their faces,
There’s pressure to maintain that
level of play.’’

Up front, W&L is blessed with ,
athleticisrn, speed, and scoring power.
Sophomore Karen Stutzmann had a
strong debut to college soccer, scor-
ing a school-record 10 goals and
eaming first-team All-ODAC honors.
Joining Stutzmann most likely will be
former All-ODAC selection Ashley
Gray, who after on-and-off battles »
with injuries for the last two years is
ready to return to the form of her
freshman season. t

Veterans Katie Seeman, Andrea
Cardamone, Morgan Warner are all
proven goal-scorers (each has had
multi-goal seasons in the past), and
they will further strengthen the W&L
attack. Sophomores Corinda Hankins
(7 goals and All-ODAC in 90) and
Angie Carrington (3 goals in ’90) and *
junior Susan Moseley (4 goals in '90)
provide offensive punch in the middle
of the field, as well.
