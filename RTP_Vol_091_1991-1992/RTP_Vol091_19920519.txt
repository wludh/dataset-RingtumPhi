Statons Falls accident

A W&L freshman died Monday after-
noon after falling over the edge of Statons
Falls in Amherst County.

Lisa Anne
Corwin, 19, of
Olympia,
Wash., was pro-
nounced dead at
the scene about
5:30 p.m. Mon-
day. She had
spent the after-
noon swim-
ming and pic-
nicking at the
falls with three
friends.

Freshmen
R.H. Powell, Heather Loveland and Dou-
glas Boyles were at the falls with Corwin
preparing to leave when they noticed Corwin
was missing.

Powell said the three students then
looked over the edge of the falls and saw
Corwin sliding down the falls into a pool at
the bottom.

Powell said none of the group saw or
heard Corwin fall over the edge.

Powell said he ran to the nearest house
to get help while Boyles and Loveland
climbed down to the pool and tried to find
Corwin, who was trapped under the water.

The Pedlar Rescue Squad arrived first
and pulled Corwin’s body from the water at
5:30 p.m.

The body was taken to Virginia Bap-
tist Hospital in Lynchburg. An autopsy is
being performed to determine the cause of
death,

Statons Falls is 17 miles east of Lexing-
ton in the George Washington National For-
est, A large flat rock at the top of the falls
looks over a 50 foot almost-vertical drop
down to a series of shallow pools.

“The falls are really quite dangerous,”
said Duval Doss, investi-
gator for the Amherst
County Sheriff's Depart-
ment.

“With all the rain
we've had, there is a lot
more water moving over
them, It’s just a tragic ac-
cident,”

Doss said an investi-
gation of the death is con-
tinuing, but that it has al-
ready been ruled an acci-
dent.

“We have no reason
to believe this is anything
other than a tragic acci-
dent,” he said.

The university is
planning a memorial ser-
vice for Corwin before the
end of the year.

“The university com-
munity is saddened by this
terrible tragedy,” Univer-
sity President John Wil-
son said Tuesday.

“Lisa Corwin was a
fine young woman and we
truly grieve for her family
and friends.”

Corwin was the
daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

 

Alan Corwin of Olympia, Wash. Her father
is a member of the Washington and Lee
class of 1962.

This Special Report was prepared by
staff members Thomas Eisenhauer, Cathy
