Honor Study:
‘Weekly Report’

Last Wednesday several members
of the honor system study group
interviewed the Chairman of the
Honor Council at the University of
Virginia, Tom Bagby. The purpose
of the trip to Charlottesville was to
compare the effectiveness and struc-
ture of their honor system with our
own, During the discussion several
differences in the two system be-
came apparent

First of all, UVa‘s system places
considerably more responsibility on
the individual than does the system
at W&L. At UVa the procedure
leading to an honor trial is as fol-
lov the student who observes a
possible honor violation (the ac
) approaches the accused and
» explain his actions; if
is unable to provide a

reasonable explanation, the accuser
takes it upon himself to ask the
accused to leave the university. I
the accused willfully leaves the unt
versity, the case is never brought
before the Honor Council. But if
the accused refuses to leave, the
matter is taken to the Honor Coun-
cil, and an investigation ensues
However, if a reasonable explana
tion is given by the accused in the
first place, the whole matter ts
dropped
Secondly, UVa seems to have a
more extensive orientation program
to their honor system, Newly en-
rolled students first hear a speech
on the system; then they discuss
the system at length with their
dorm counselors; and finally they
are given a chance to question mem
hers of the Honor Council. The goal
is for freshmen and transfers to
have a thorough knowledge of the
svstem from the very Start
Thirdly, UVa‘'s Honor Council
xists as a separate entity from the
body responsible for their student
government. The Honor Council is
made up of officers from each
school of the university {these
officers afc fo the most part
niors). There are no class repre
sentatives, and this has caused prob
lems in determining the views held
h respect to the honor system
by the “student generation involv
ed
Procedurally. UVa's honor trials
are much more legalistic than those
at W&L. Law students are chosen
to argue for and against the ac
cused and are given several days

may be opened of closed as the a

may be opened at any time upon

day of George Washington, the uni-
versity’s first great benefactor.

President Robert F. R. Huntley
will be the principal speaker, and
is expected to deliver a far-ranging
address on the state of the uni-
versity.

Dr. John Newton Thomas of
Richmond, rector of the Washington
and Lee board of trustees, and
John M. Thomas of Dallas, Tex..
a board member and chairman of
its development committee, will join
Mr. Huntley in addressing the con-
vocauion

Attendance of all students at the

Convocation is expected. The fac

for the academic procession on the
300 level (the floor below the basket-
ball court). There is direct access
to this floor from the Washington
Street entrance.

There will be a shortened class
schedule as follows:

Mock Convention Head
Outlines Progress To E.C.

By JOHN ZINK

The Executive Committee heard
from the chairman of the 1972
Mock Convention Mike Campilongo
on the progress being made to pre
pare for the Mock Convention to
be held in early May. Campilongo
expressed his concern that the pres-
ent rate of progress was not great
enough

Campilongo said. “We are not as
far along as I would like to be
This thing (the Mock Convention)
is not magic: it does not have to
be a full time job, but it does
require some concentrated effort.”
When asked by Glenn Azuma, E.C.
vice-president, what shape the state
delegations are in at the present
time, Campilongo explained that all
state delegations have chairmen ex
cept for three states. He also point-
ed out that 17 state delegations are
full at this time and that 300 to
400 people are active in these
delegations.

The work of the state chairman
was stressed as being an important
factor in the progress of the Mock

Convention. “I am not pleased by
the progress, or I should say the
lack of progress on the part of the
state chairmen,” complained Cam
pilongo, He did add, however, that
the state chairmen have had a very
difficult job because they must con-
tact the state chairman to the real
National Democratic Convention
for the state that they represent.
“Some of these guys (the Demo-
cratic Chairman) will not even give
us the time of day,” said Campi-
longo. For this reason, he urged
that all Mock Convention state
chairmen start this part of their
task immediately.

The main question posed by the
members of the EC concerned the
financial position of the Mock Con-
vention at the present time. Campi
longo said that the Mock Conven-
tion now has $6,000 cash reserve
on deposit with a local bank and
the University. He pointed to the
largest expenditure so far as being
in the area of fund raising activi
ties and telephone costs. “We have
paid out slightly over $1,000 at this
time. two-thirds of which has been
for fund raising and about $100 for
phone bills.” commented Campi-
longo. He continued by saying that
the telephone cosis should go up,
predicting that phone costs would
be between $1,500 and $2,000 for
the period from now until the con-
vention date

Several EC members expressed
concern over keeping the telephone
bills at a minimum. Lock Handley
asked. “How js the security on the
phone?” Campilongo responded by
saving. “We have not had any
trouble with people misusing the
phone so far; there is always some-
one in the Mock Convention office
whenever it is open

hour (1:30).

Students are requested to be in
their seats before 12 o'clock so that
the assembly can begin promptly.

The Founders’ Day will represent
a departure from a long standing
tradition at Washington and Lee
University. Even National Review
commented on the date change from
Lee's birthday to Washington's
birthday.

According to university by-laws
Lee’s birthday is to be a_ holiday
with an assembly. But this year the
faculty voted to move the event
back about a month. Bob Keefe,
Director of Public Information,
said it was only under “extraordin-
ary circumstances” that the date
vas altered. Keefe said the faculty
postponed the celebration because
of an upcoming Board of Trustees
meeting that might affect President
Huntley's announcement.

The faculty has already approved
next year’s calender which provides
for a holiday on Lee's birthday. So
the Founders’ Day assembly will be
held once again next year on Janu-
ary 19.

Week Set For
Black Culture

By LARRY D. JONES
Assistant to the Dean of Students
and Advisor to S.A.B.U,

In America today, where we are
constantly made aware of the po-
larization of the races; where we
find more time and money to sup-
port our outer-space ego; where
many students across the nation
are being more enlightened by
“speed” and “pot” than anything
else. | am happy to note that Wash
ington and Lee University has taken
a more constructive attitude. | am
elated to announce that a dream
which | have had for the past
couple of years is finally approach
ine reality. That dream is to have
a Black Culture program here

On the dates February 28-March
4. 1972, Washington and Lee will
witness an educational first. That
week has been dedicated “Black
Week.” My Brothers have worked
to establish a program which we
hope will be an on-going tradition
among the many traditions at W&l
We wish to thank President Huntley,
the administration, the organiza
tions, and the many faculty mem
bers and students who have sup-
ported us in this effort

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Third In A Series

W G&L: Where It Has Been, Where It Is Going .. .

Development Offic

By J. HAGOOD ELLISON

The Office of Development is one
phase of the University administra-
tion with which students rarely have
contact. Yet this office plays a key
role in the short-run operations and.
long-term growth of Washington
and Lee, Not only are the Develop-
ment. staff responsible for meeting
any immediate costs, but they are
charged with the financial develop-
ment of the school.

This office is relatively new on
campus, scarcely over a decade old.
With operating expenses spiraling.
WAL, like all universities, has had
to open separate committees and
offices to meet the ever-increasing
needs. The “Self-Study Report of
the University, 1964-1966," called
for “more formally established de-
velopment services, on a continuing
basis, to meet the University’s
financial requirements of the future.”
This was reiterated in the “Report
of the Visiting Committee to Wash-
ington and Lee” by the Southern
Association of Colleges and Schools.
in November, 1966. Their ten-man
committee acknowledged that the
University had, by then, taken signi-
ficant steps toward a “more so-
phisticated development program.”

The following is taken from an
interview with Director of Develop-
ment Farris Hotchkiss, who has
served in that capacity since 1962.
He talks about the role of the De-
velopment Office. the problems en-
countered in funding the addition to
Doremus, and the financial prob-
lems of coeducation.

Ring-tum Phi: Why was the De-
velopment. Office started?

Hotchkiss: The proper way to put
that is that the Development Office
was reestablished in 1968; W&L
had a development function as long

ago as 1950, In fact, for a small
school, we were one of the leaders
in the development area. Mr. James
Whitehead who is now our Trea-
surer, came in 1958 to become
director of development and stayed
in that job through 1962 approxi-
mately, when he became Assistant
to the President and then Treasurer.

The great difference though is
that for many years Washington and
Lee and other private schools de-
pended very heavily on a reservoir
of goodwill and generous feelings
from people that we assumed would
simply emanate naturally from their
having had contact with our school,
This was not an unrealistic way to
look at it. Presuming that you
turned out a good product, that
is your students, and presuming that
the school remained admirable in
all respects, it could be expected
that people» of wealth would na-
turally come to your aid, both
through gifts during their lifetime

and through their estates. What
happened, though, is that the
school realized that we could no

longer rely on what | suppose you
might call “good public relations”
to carry on in regard to our fund
raising.

So the Development Office was
organized or reorganized in 1968
with three specific functions in mind.
The first was, to raise each year
the necessary amount of money to
make up the difference between
what if cost to operate during an
academic year and our revenues,
For instance, last year it took $737,-
000 to make up that difference and
keep us in the black. This part of
the development function is gen-
erally called Annual Giving; it is
the Alumni Fund, the Parents’ Fund,
certain gifts that come from

activity in-as-emuch as you don't
have squads of class agents and
others running around the coun-
try. It tends to be a quiet, individu-
alized approach with people who
are known to have the resources
that are sufficient to make large
gifts. Generally speaking. in this
office, this is carried out through
the efforts of the President of the

University, and through my own
efforts.

called Deferred Giving and this is
probably one of the most exciting
and encouraging areas in educa-
tional development work today. You

Ring-tum .Phi: What problems do
you foresee in going coed?

Hotchkiss: Well, from. a_ de-
velopment standpoint, T'll have to
answer your questions. two ways.
From a fund raising standpoint, |
don't think there would. be any
particular problem. | think there. is
no doubt that there would be some
of our alumni who would at
first hearing that Washington. and
Lee would become coeducational,
might be somewhat dismayed. just
as they were when W&L | stopped
subsidizing athletics back. in the
early 1950's. But, in the long .run,
| think that our alumni and most
of the people on whom we depend
primarily, would not stay so un-
happy. with that decision that. it
would hurt us from a fund raising
standpoint. There might be a little
bobble on the other side of the
fence: coeducation is a very ex-
pensive consideration, as you might
assume. You first have to house
ladies somewhere on campus and

make what is called a deferred
gift and that is a way for a person
to give over to the university, on
an irrevocable basis, certain assets,
but retain the income from those
assets for his lifetime and. if he so
chooses, for the lifetime of one
of his beneficiaries. That is the kind
of giving that lets you have your
cake and eat it too. You get your
tax deduction, you get the pleasure
and joy of seeing a gift thai is
working for your alma mater, and
at the same time. if income is im-
portant to you, you havent given

You also have other considera-

things that you at first don't think
of; such things as facilities in the
buildings you already have, and
ours are old buildings. Security,

that we have been told are an
absolute must. There would have to
be some additional staff in line with
having ladies on campus: His
probable that you would have to
have a dean of women . And,
lastly, there are comsequenees upon

a forecast for fund raising develop-
ment .for the next ten years?,

Hotehkiss:. Well,.in the next ten
years,. Washington and Lee will see
a comprehensive. development .. pro-
gram that will call for the addition
to the-campus of several buildings
like the .gymnasium,.like the law
school. building,. like the | library,
and. some. refurbishing. of buildings
that are already. on our campus
that are perfectly sound in most
respects. but need work. There is
a good deal of planning with land-
scape. architects. that is going on
right now in order to decide how
to develop what we might. call the
expanded campus, the part of the
campus that. falls on the. western
side of the ravine.

In addition to that, we know that
WA&L simply will not be in healthy
financial shape.in say, 1980,. if
between now. and then there hasn't
been a drastic increase in our en-
dowment.. We-have an endowment
that fluctuates of course from month
to month. There.is about a 20 to
22 million. dollar endowment, and
it is generally. considered that .the
endowment is going to have to
grow by perhaps a like amount in
the next decade. Washington and
Lee ought to be having twice the
endowment earning available to it
in 1980,.as it does now,

So we are talking about a de-
velopment. program that is obvi-
ously in the tens of millions of
dollars. The trustees are in the final
stages of capping that kind of pro-
gram off. We already are raising
money even though we don't have
an announced program on our
hands. We are not letting that hold
us back from talking to foundations
and corporations. and people who
are in the position to make major
gifts. Some of these gifts have al-
ready been fortheoming, like the
Keenan gift for instance. a $600,-
000, that was announced at gradua-
tion last year, and like some of the
scholarship funds that have come to
us as endowment additions, and the
gymnasium gifts. We are not letting
the fact that we dont have a
finely polished and ‘all the ques-
tions answered’ development pro-
gram, prevent us from going ahead
and raising substantial funds.

Ring-tum Phi: As far as looking
back on the last ten years, will
you comment on the success or
failure of the development pro-
gram?

Hotchkiss: Well, looking back
ten years, | think that WA&L’s fund
raising efforts have been remark-
ably good. I really do. The Trustees
of this university have taken an
unusual hand in seeing to it that
we remain. financially healthy. All
you have to do these days is pick
up most any newspaper. | see the
Chronicle of Education. once a week
and hardly a week goes by that it
isn't announced that one school or
another. is in serious financial
trouble, going in the red more and
more. The wealthiest schools in the
U.S.. the wealthiest schools in the
world, are in the red. and I think
the fact that WAL has stayed in
the black, without having to cut
its services is commendable. We
are not reducing our faculty, we
are not depriving our students of
anything that they have enjoyed in
the past.

In fact. in modesi ways we are
offering them more than they did
enjoy in the past. and with all of
that we are staying solidly in the
black. Our annual giving programs.
that, probably more than any of
the others, are specifically respon-
sible for this kind of success and
have been going up nicely every
year. | guess the most dramaiic
thing that | can point to along
that line. is the fact that the trustees
established the Robert E. Lee As
sociates Program in 1968; this pro
gram is designed for persons who
take an unusual interest in the uni
versily and express that interest
quite frankly, monetarily. This as-
sociation now has over 300 people

hat Is Its Role?

in it, and this | think points out, to
a certain extent, the kind of mo-
mentum and response that we have
been able to generate.

Let me say just one more thing.
| have a thought that | would like
to share with you that | feel very
strongly about. This country of ours
must have, it seems to me, a_bal-
anced. educational system. I think
that we would be greatly harmed
if we ever got to the point where
all of our schools were state schools,
or all of our schools were private
schools, or all were church schools,
and since W&L University repre-

We should always maintain a mix,
sents the private or independent
sector of education, | think that all

of us who have anything to do
with it — whether we're students
under that system or work for

that system, or are alumni of that
system, or whatever — need to re-
member that the very definition of
what a private, independent school
is, is partially that the school has
from the beginning assumed that it
must raise its own funds to meet
its Own expenses without receiving
help from church or state. So often,
I think, people who are connected
with private schools fool themselves
by assuming that fund raising for
these private institutions is some-
thing you had to resort to. It's some-
thing that has come upon you
anew. But, this just simply isn’t
so. This was part of a plan from
day one. And, if it should ever fail
to be part of the plan then you
would have negated one of the
primary definitions of an _ inde-
pendent, private school. | think that
is important for us all to remember.

Ring-tum Phi: [| would like to
know why the Development Office
has been so slow in funding the
new gymnasium? As | understand,
the payment has not been com-
pleted.

Hotchkiss: Well that is a good
question, and one that has a very
interesting answer. Washington and
Lee has been for the past two
years or more now under the
direction of John Stemmons (trustee
from Dallas, Texas), who is making
very, very thorough and extensive
plans for the university's compara-
tively long-run future. There is no
doubt whatsoever that Washington
and Lee must have in the next few
yeats some new buildings on this
campus and a greatly increased en
dowment. You don't grab these
things out of the air, and when you
put the university in the position of
asking for help that is very, very
large in its dimension, you want to
be sure that you are absolutely cor-
rect in your assessment of what
your needs really are.

What happened, though, in re-
gard to the gymnasium, was that
there was absolutely no disagree-
ment whatsoever that the gymnasium
was something that the school had
to have. Added to that from an
architectural standpoint, there also
was no problem whatsoever in how
to bring about the desired result.
lt wasn’t a hard thing to figure out
There was no massive relocation of
buildings involved. It didn't mean
that we had to swap any facilities
So for all of the physical reasons,
and for all of the planning reasons,
it seemed that the gymnasium in-
deed was a facility that we need
not wail to go ahead with, if we
could raise the requisite amount of
money. The gymnasium is an ex-
pensive facility: it is a $3,000,000
facility.

Washington Lee had only
once if its entire history, in an
organized way. tried to raise $3
million and that was in 1949 when
we celebrated our bicentennial. In
1959 and 1960. Washington and
Lee atiempted to raise $2 million
and was successful in doing so, for
mew science facilities and for re
furbishing Reid Hall. So we decid
ed that the gymnasium was some
thing that had been promised the
studenis and the faculty for nearly

Letters To The Editor...

Wreden’s Rebuttal

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

In a letter to the Phi-last week,
Lock Handley asserts that my argu-
ments against a coed W&L could
have been used in 1965 to argue
against admitting blacks to a lily-
white school, Then he asks: “How
is sexual segregation different from
racial segregation?

In my opinion, my arguments
could not have been used in 1965
because the reasons Washington
and Lee stayed all-white and the
reasons W&L remains all-male are
completely different. There is a big
difference between racial and sexual
segregation,

Washington and Lee had moral
responsibility to admit blacks in the
mid-sixties. Blacks needed and de-
served as many opportunities to at-
tend quality academic institutions in
the South as whites did, and W&L
opening its doors gave blacks that
needed extra opportunity.

This school has no similar moral
responsibility to admit girls. Again,
if someone wants to go to a coed
school, he has more than enough
opportunity and choices already. It
is one thing to admit blacks to give
then a needed educational oppor-
tunity in the South; it is another
to become the one hundred thous-
andth school to admit girls.

I suspect that W&L remained
all-white mainly because of reg-
ional practices and prejudices, not
because of worry about alumni do-
nations or a desire to provide an
all-white haven, If this school had
been in another part of the country,
undoubtedly it would have admitted
blacks long before it did .

Washington and Lee has remain-
ed all-male because of tradition and
a desire to offer a high quality
choice. Despite this school’s baud-
able tendency to view traditions
with a critical eye, | believe that
WAL would be all-male in any part
of the country today.

Racial segregation is different
from sexual segregation, Racial
segregation is based upon a feeling

that one race is superior to another.
No one defends sexual segregation
by arguing that females are superior
to males or vice versa. Racial
segregation is based on fear of
some sort, No single-sex institution
keeps the other sex out because
they are afraid of them or use terror
tactics to make them want to stay
out. Racial segregation is usually
set up by one part of society to
avoid competition from another seg-
ment. No one contends that an insti-
tution should remain single-sex in
order to avoid competition, aca-
demic or otherwise, from the op-
posite sex,

After noting the differences be-
tween the two, can one still argue
that sexual segregation is the same
as racial segregation and therefore
just as odious?

Kurt Krumperman, in another
letter to the Phi last week, said
WAL is not living up to its educa-
tional philosophy because it is not
admitting girls. He said, “What it
would mean (W&L going coed) is
that at last Washington and Lee
will begin to practice that philo-
sophy, The exclusion of women as
a group contradicts the emphasis
we put on the individual, It contra-
dicts our interest in learning and
understanding when we intention-
ally restrict women from participat-
ing in the learning environment.”

Krumperman seems to think ad-
mitting girls would magically trans-
form Washington and Lee into an
intellectual Utopia. And until this
school admits girls, W&L will re-
main a closed institution not really
interested in individual emphasis
and intellectual achievement.

I disagree. Washington and Lee
does dedicate “all of its resources
to the development of man’s ca-
pacity and desire to learn” and
would hopefully continue to do so
if the school goes coed, Being all-
male has not put a stranglehold on

intellectual creativity or achieve-
ment,
Somehow, | do not understand

how the exclusion of women as a
group contradicts W&L's emphasis

on the individual. Individual em-
phasis is a person-to-person affair,
and should be affected very little
by outside groups, whether exclud-
ed or not,

I also do not understand Lock
Handley’s comment that W&L is
“a type of ‘game preserve’ for male
chauvinism.” Chauvinism is an ex-
aggerated loyalty to a cause, and
I don't feel that most W&L students
are devoted to the creed of male
superiority because they go to an
all-male school,

I am not against coeducation per
se; | am just against a coed W&L
tll more compelling arguments are
presented other than sexual segrega-
tion is just like racial segregation
or W&L can bloom intellectually
only if girls are admitted,

A final note: If Washington and
Lee does go coed, it should not
expand its enrollment to 1800, The
administration should avoid — the
overwhelming temptation to get
more money by packing a few extra
students in one class, a few more
in another. Quality education can
never be measured by the number
of students in a classroom.

Nick Wreden ‘74

Lack of Spirit Lamented

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:
I read Lex McMillan’s article last
week with both head-nodding ap-
proval, and teary-eyed sadness.
Though the new Doremus is a great
benefit to the students and the
Athletic Department, I think I share
a feeling with many when I re-
member the weeknight varsity bas-
ketball games in Old Doremus. The
spacious new gym lacks the ca-
pacity for burning tempers and
effective shouting and harassing
which were so characteristic of the
old gym. The close quarters of
Old Doremus brought everyone
present together, so much so that
some teams refused to come to
Lexington to play. That was spirit.
However, listen for a moment at
our next game, and see if it doesn't
sound like a wrestling match which
you might see on television. It's a
new era in basketball. I wish some-
one would turn up the heat in the

new wing.

Clarification Given

lo the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

In view of misunderstandings that
have arisen from my letter of last
week regarding coeducation, | would
like to underline the fact that I
in no way agree with the views
expressed in quotation marks as to
the disadvantages of racial integra-
tion. To the extent that the letter
may be read as perpetuating a
stereotyped image of Black people,
| am extremely sorry that it was
ever published. Nor did I mean to

Black History Week

This week is celebrated through-
out the nation as “Black History
Week.” Although some individual
schools and so-called leaders of the
people still do not understand the
relevance of Black history, there
are some who feel that this is the
time for Americans to recognize the
real Black American and praise him
for his contributions to the world.

| have decided to devote this
week's article to my fellow Black
brothers and sisters who still may
be indoctrinated with old definition
of “liberty and freedom for all.”

My Dear Black Brothers and Sisters.

First. | ask you to forgive your
mother and father for telling you
to “always turn the other cheek,”
They thought that they were doing
it for your well being. | can not
foliow the old be passive and wait
upon the Lord advice while I look
around and see that for over three
centuries Black people have been
subjugated simply because they were
thought to have the wrong skin
color. | can not follow teachings
of that nature while I look around
and see my Indian brother excluded
from society, The Indian was the

first one here on this land bui
yet remains the last to be cared
about

Brothers, did you know that the
Indian has the highest suicide rate
among teenagers of any racial group
in America’ Did vou know that the
Indian has the highest infant mor-
tality of any racial group in
America’? Finally, did you know
that the American government, a
sovernment that is assumed to he
conceived in liberty and dedicated
io the proposition that all men are
sill
Indian brothers on a

created equal holds your

reservation’

imply that the discrimination which
besets women in our society is as
serious a problem as that with
which Blacks are faced.

A Glorious Experience

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Previously, | was not disposed to
regard coeducation at W&L with a
moral perspective, but after read-
ing those most profound letters
from last week's publication, I be-
gan to really see the light. It was
this glorious experience of finally
having the truth revealed which
has inspired me to confess my
“sexist” iniquities and lay bare my
prejudices for the benefit of future
posterity.

What is the truth, you say? Kate
Millet, in her “divine” wisdom, has
told us that American society is so
constituted, and American politics
so structured as to completely ex-
clude women from any meaningful
chance to participate in the work-
ings of our system. And of course
we as students ought to realize that
this university is but an arm of
this “male Chauvinist” system of
ours, It is “self-evident” then, that
only through coeducation can our
salvation be attained and those ideals
for which this university exists be
realized,

But it is also “self-evident” that
this virtuous crusade cannot be al-
lowed to stop here. For if it is the
society which is the source of this
intolerable evil, then our egalitarian
effort should “and of right ought
to be” directed against it. I have
it from the highest authority (i.c.
Betty Friedan in The Feminine
Mystique) that a quasi-conspiracy
exists among major advertising
agencies, “women’s magazines,” and
the media for the purpose of pro-
gramming women to accept the sub-
missive, family-oriented role within
society, and to look upon herself as
inferior in abilities and desires to
men, It is all so very clear to me
now.

| realize how totally irrelevant
the family, as an institution, is in
present day society. How could any
self-respecting women possibly re-
gard such prehistoric concepts as the
family, the home, and children to
be the only things of importance for
her life. How can one not recognize
the degrading condition which our
male-dominated society imposes
upon every female through _ its
sinister tools of “sexual segrega-
tion,” “unisexual universities,” career
stagnation, economic-political en-
slavement, men’s clubs, fraternities,
Playboy clubs, beauty contests, TV
quiz shows, soap operas, bras,
girdles, cross-word puzzles, bridge
games, the fiendish typewriter, the
library, and many more items and
activities which ruthlessly attempt to
establish a rigid framework in which

his is just a glimpse of the few
unjust practices by a government
and an institutional system which
considers itself just. In paraphras-
ing the words of a political theorist,
man is free, but everywhere we
look we find him in chains.

Brothers and sisters. you may
consider yourself the new breed of
“Black Awareness.” Sometimes
when you are approached by some-
one of the opposite race, you may
go into your bag and come out
someday truculent and brutish be-
cause you do not want any one to
consider you a softie, | think it my
duty to remind you that your grand-
mother and grandfather were re
calcitrant sometimes, It is beneficial
sometimes and also harmful some
times, This recalcirant attitude to
others may be something you and
your grandparents have in common,
but now your grandparents are
dead, Their bodies may be alive
physically, but spiritually they are
dead as a nail.

Your grandparents believed some
thing which I hope you will never
come to think of as almost or
possibly being right. Deep down
inside and af the bottom of their
hearts, your grandparents believed
what the white people of America
said about him. Now, can you see
why the white people rever Booker
tT. Washineton but detest Marcus
Garvey, Angela Davis and Mal
com X? I assume that you are of
no part of the holiness men like
Booker T. Washington, but are of
another time and era.

Brothers and sisters, the primary
goal of your lives should be learn.
ing how to listen for yourself, to
see for yourself and to think for
yourself. Tf you follow this patiern

By MARC JAMES SMALL

The greatest single cause in the
collapse of the American educa-
tional system has been the mania
of educators to convert their col-
leges and universities from places
of learning to hotbeds of “social
engineering.” By thus shifting the
emphasis from education of the
mind to the moral character of an
individual, they have not only sacri-
ficed the intelligence of a nation
and a civilization but have as well
taken upon themselves a_ senseless
and impossible task whose only out-
come will be the thorough confu-
sion and illiteracy of a generation
or more of those who should be
leading this nation.

We have suffered this change
here at Washington and Lee, It
was not too many years ago that
this school had a student body com-
prised almost entirely of what is
now derogatorily referred to as
“homogeneous” body. Yet, this
homogeneity was not, in itself, an
evil, for it formed a student body
which could work together  effici-
ently and avoid those tensions we
are now suffering. It allowed the
Honor System to be maintained.

Most importantly, it did these
things without harming the educa-
tional processes and upsetting the
very purpose for which Washington
and Lee exists, In spite of this, we
have abandoned this principle and
now are drawing into the student
body students who are unable to
work together and who have be-
tween themselves tensions that, if
not soon checked, might destroy
W&L as a serious institution of
higher learning.

Even as I write this, proposals

are being considered that would ex-
pand Washington and Lee’s student
body to two thousand. We have
been suffering the pangs of ex-
pansion ever since World War II:
space has become a premium, we
lack classrooms, library space, and,
perhaps the most irritating, we have
a drastic parking problem. Any
further expansion of the student
body would only aggravate these
already-crucial problems without
bringing into the school any benefits.
Even with the new construction
being considered — which would,
in most cases, only accomodate
current needs — we would still be
terribly overcrowded. At the same
time, such expansion would have
adverse effects on the education
offered here, for it would lower the
faculty-to-student ratio and would
put us well on the way toward be-
coming another “diploma mill.”
The faddishness of the academic
world is sometimes beyond belief.
Why should this school sacrifice
time-honored and proven principles
only to become but one out of
many nameless, faceless, and bland
schools? Is it not enough that we
are what we are? It it not enough
that this school has its own unique
and particular identity which no
other school has? Is it not enough
that W&L offers an education mark-
ed by its high quality and close
faculty-student ties? Why should
we sacrifice all that we now have
for the nebulous and all-too-typical
mediocrity of many other schols?
The unique quality of education at
Washington and Lee is its own de-
fense: we have little to gain but
much to lose by attempting poorly-
considered and ill-advised changes.

Generals Fall To R-M, Trounce
York; Season Record Now 13-7

By PALMER TRICE

If we had to do it over again,
we'd do it exactly the same way.”
The Generals four point loss to
Randolph-Macon was a__heart-
breaker. In most ball games, it’s
impossible to point out turning
points, but in this one, Coach Verne
Canfield) pointed out five errors
committed by the Generals as being
the keys to the contest. The five
included two turnovers, a
blocked shot, and a pair of de-
fensive errors. Otherwise, the game
was one of the best played games
by the Blue team of the year.

Wednesday night’s visit to Ran-
dolph-Macon was a particularly im-
portant road trip for the W&L B-
ballers. Several goals were on the
line, among them being the chances
for a twenty win season, a win at
Macon, and a big in-state victory
fhe Generals were “up” for the
game. Though they trailed by as
many as eight in the first half, they
refused to quit. Down 24-16 with
five minutes remaining in the first
half, the Blue closed to within four
at the half, 35-31.

The Generals faced a_ tough,
physical Yellow Jacket defense, and
handled it well. The Yellow Jacket
defense included a new twist—a
double or triple team on Mike
Daniel. The tactic succeeded in hold-
ing the leading scorer to only 14
points, far below his season's aver-

errors

Seniors To

Five senior players will be honor-
ed Saturday night during their last
regular season home basketball game
at Washington and Lee.

rhe five are forward Mike Daniel
of Cincinnati; center John Glace of
Carlisle, Pa.; and guards Ellie
Gutshal lof Elkins, W. Va., Dave
Stone of Chicago and Scott Wood
of Chatham, N. Y.

Daniel, the team captain and
leading scorer with a 24.0 average,
has played regularly since his fresh-
man year, and currently ranks fifth

age. Paul McClure responded with
19 points and 9 rebounds, Skip
Lichtfuss added 18 points.

With 11:37 remaining, the Gen-
erals took the lead for the first time
in the ball game, 47-46, but this
did not last long. With 2:52 re-
maining, the Yellow Jackets boosted
their lead to five on a fast break.
A McClure jumper pulled the Gen-
erals to within three, 68-65, but the
Jackets ran it back up to five. With
1:30 remaining, McClure once again
brought the Blue to within three.
A Skip Lictfuss jumper at the 1:07
mark brought them to within one.
70-69. With 25 seconds remaining.
Lichtfuss stole a pass from Dennis
Howard. The Generals ran the clock
down to the :12 second mark. The
ball went inside to Daniel, who put
up a lay-up. It rimmed in and out.
Dennis Howard was fouled on the
rebound. He made his first. try,
missed the second, but came up
with the rebound, He was fouled
by Doug Clelan with eight seconds
left. and sank both free throws,
which accounted for the final 73-
69 margin. It was a disappointing
loss, as the team played well. Coach
Canfield failed once again to win
at Randolph-Macon, and hopes of
a twenty game season were dashed,

Saturday night's seven o'clock
contest with York College was not
much of a contest. The Generals
played everyone, and came up with

Be Honored

on the all-time list of W&L scorers
with 1,514 career points. He needs
only 48 points in his remaining six

an impressive 92-62 victory, Except
for the early goings, the Generals
dominated the contest on both ends
of the court. The Blue used their
height to good advantage, as they
ran and ran and ran. Paul Me-
Clure had an outstanding night,
as he tallied 24 points and 12 re-
bounds. The Generals used a wide
variety of defenses, including sev-
eral presses, the matchup, and the
man for man, Thanks in a large
part to the number of easy shots
taken at the end of the fast break,
the Blue shot an excellent 51%.

Thursday, the Generals travel to
Dickinson College, in Carlisle, Penn-
sylvania. Dickinson has a 12-5 rec-
ord, the Blue, a 13-7 record, Satur-
day night’s contest with Davis and
Elkins College will be the final
regular season appearance for this
year’s seniors. A program will be
held at some time during the eve-
ning in their honor,

If the Blue can close fast, a
post-season tourney berth might be
possible. The CAC Tourney is com-
ing soon, and it should be tougher
than usual, The word is that Se-
wanee has a 7-footer,

Coach Bill Stearns of the swim-
ming teams says, “We could do
better in the state and conference
meets. We have several individuals
who show up better in big meets.”
The swimmers have a record of
4-6, the first losing season since the
1940's,

The freshmen basketball squad
has been called “The finest since
I've been here,” by the coach Tom
Davies. Davies has guided the frosh
for five seasons. Three major col-
lege opponents have met the Baby
Blue: Virginia, VMI, and Navy. The
squad's record is now 9-2 with a
pair of contests left on the schedule.

“Eight or nine players could make
the varsity next year,” Davies add-
ed. “Six will, for sure.”

Stu. Nibley continues to be the
big gun for the rookie team. He
leads the team in assists, field goal
percentage and points-per-game at
20.7. Guy Kerr is hitting at a 12.1
point clip and has more steals in
11 games than any freshman team
player has compiled in recent mem-
ory. Guy is third in rebounds and
second in assists, Randy Taylor is
the top rebounder for the frosh
although he has suffered from a
foot injury. Burr Datz has been
credited by Davies for fine “clutch
performances,”

Senior Captain Mike Daniels takes a 24 point average into Saturday’s last home game against Davis and Elkins

WRESTLING STATISTICS

Duncan DeGraff continues to
lead the W&L grapplers in statistics.
Duncan has 36 team points to his
credit, the team high mark. His
record in competition is also. best
for the squad—seven wins and two
losses. In his nine matches DeGraff

Coach Verne Canfield’s team its
sixth straight winning season. In
the past five years W&L has posted
season records of 20-5, 19-6, 18-5,
17-8, and 17-8, and currently stands
13-7 with six games remaining.

It will be a homecoming of
sorts for two W&L cagers,  start-
ing guard Doug Clelan of Harris-
burg, Pa. and key reserve center
John Glace of Carlisle. Clelan is
scoring at 7.6-per-game clip, and
is threatening to break the all-time
season record for assists, set by Mel
Cartwright two years ago. To date,
Clelan has 90 assists, and needs
just slightly more than five in each
of the remaining games to_ break
Cartwright’s mark of 120,

Glace is the fifth-leading scorer
for the Generals with a 6.6-mark,
and also is fifth in rebounds with

53 for the year. He has frequently
started for W&L in his four years
on the varsity.

WAL ended its only losing streak
at two last Saturday night with a
92-62 breeze over another Penn-
sylvania team, York College. Prior
to that, the Generals had been in-

volved in four straight close ball
games with Virginia opponents,

winning the first two but dropping
the last pair.

The Generals edged Hampden-
Sydney, 78-75 in overtime, then re-

one of his patented driving layups
with 12 seconds. left. that would
have given W&L a one-point lead.
Daniel continues to pace the Gen-
erals with a 24.0 scoring average,
despite relatively low-scoring efforts
(14 and 18 points) in the last two
outings. Sophomore Skip Lichtfuss
is averaging 15.6 points a game, and
6-8 junior Doug McClure is scor-
ing at a 12.8 pace and. is the
leading rebounder with 11 per game.
After Dickinson Thursday night,
the Generals return for their final
regular season home game Saturday
night against Davis & Elkins.

Washington and Lee's swimming
team closed out its regular season

Honor System:
Weekly Report

(Continued from page 1)
justice a case may be reheard by
the Honor Council
In response to our questions on

ome issues that directly relate to

the situation here at W&L, repre
sentatives of UVa said that they
have not observed any weakening of

their honor system which they can
attribute solely to the increase in
ive of their student body, Nor have
they seen any ill effects on the
honor system resulting directly from
the presence of women within the
student body

The interview at the University
of Virginia leads us to the final and
most important phase of the honor
system study—that phase which di
ctly involves the W&L_ student
body itself, Next Wednesday, Febru
ary 23, questionnaires concerning
the honor system will be available
in the Co-op for students to fill out
Also. on Wednesday and Thursday
from four o'clock to six o'clock
members of the study group. will
be in Room 208 of the Student
Center to listen to any students who

sh to make comments or express
opinions concerning the honor sys
tem. And finally, a random sample
poll of student opinion will be con
ducted next week, hopefully leading
toward an accurate notion of what
WAL students today feel about the

honor system

that it would cost about $2,000 for
the setting up of the convention

He pointed out that the Mock
Convention must also hire members
of the University work crews fot
extra-hours work. “The parade will
take a budget of about $500, and
the limited printing of the Platform
wil cost another $300,” he said.

Campilongo expressed his concern
at cutting costs whenever possible
He pointed to the last Mock Con
