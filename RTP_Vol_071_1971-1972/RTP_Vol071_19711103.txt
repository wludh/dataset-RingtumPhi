. T. C. Imesen reported that
the Student Affairs Committee had
met and had removed parietal regu-
lations from the Law and Upper-
class dormitories. The committee
also interviewed counselors and re-
viewed polls from freshmen; at the
next meeting, the S.A.C. will inter-
view freshman class officers in order
to further explore the possibility of
abolishing parietals in the freshman
dormitories.

Freshman University Council Re-
presentative Bob Keatley said fresh-
man officers and representatives
from each section had met before
Thursday's meeting and that the
“general consensus was that each
dorm section should establish its
own limits concerning social rules,
A consensus preferred that parietals
be removed.”

The current registration system
for freshmen demands that they reg-
ister for all three terms in the fall of
their freshman year. There was
strong sentiment on the UC that
freshmen should be allowed a term-
by-term registration rather than the
full-year registration that now exists.

Dr. Evans then opened discussion
on an ombudsman for the Univer-
sity. He recommended a student-se-
lected faculty member for the post,
who would act as an advertised
dividual to “look into student prob-
lems.” Rob Schatz commented that:

. (such an ombudman) presents
a challenge to the faculty members
by taking away their authority or
sovereignty.”

Dr. E. L. Pinney noted that: “His-
torically, the Swedish Ombudsman
went about setting right certain grie-
vances. The ombudsman soon found
that he was occupied with trivial
matters. It seems to me this kind of
man, requires great ability, so as
not to become engulfed in trivial af-
fairs.”

The tone of these sessions is to be
informal, according to Gerald Poud
rier, the weekend's director, and
while parents are requested to attend
the Seminar group assigned, they
should feel free to come and go as
they wish, and to ask whatever ques-
tions they feel are important.

Following the seminars and the
Report to Parents, guests may attend
the Parents’ Luncheon in Evans Din-

are $1.75 per person and may be
purchased at the Registration Desk.

At 2:00 p.m. on Wilson Field,
Washington and Lee’s Football Gen-

A wide-range of extracurricular
activities will also be presented to
the parents. In addition to the de
bate, parents may take in a concert

The final discussion of the even-

Dr. Imeson said that the SAC had

two or three hours about their prob-

‘A Lawyer Looks at Ci

Ed. note. The following excerpts
from an article by Lewis F. Powell
Jr., W&L’s Supreme Court nominee,
were first presented on April 16,
1966, as the annual John Randolph
Tucker Law Lecture at W&L. They
indicate not only the superlative
quality and breadth of his legal
scholarship and of his analytical and
expository abilities, but also in a
substantive sense it clearly demon-
strates his commitment to justice,
particularly to racial justice, and to
the equal application of the law to
black and white alike,

BY LEWIS F. POWELL, JR.

We have witnessed, over the past
decade, the rise of a heresy which
could weaken the foundations of our
system of government, and make
impossible the existence of the hu-
man freedoms it strives to protect.
This is known as the doctrine of civil
disobedience. Its basic approach is
that the ancient justification for re-
volt against tyranny can somehow
be transmuted into a rule for day to
day life under a system of govern-
ment under the law. Putting the old
wine of revolution into the new
wineskin of constitutional govern-
ment, it argues appealingly that:
some laws are “just” and others “un-
just’; that each person may deter-
mine for himself, in accordance with
his own conscience, which laws are
“unjust”; and that each is free to
violate the “unjust” laws—provided
he does so peacefully.

The doctrine of civil disobedience
has been associated with the civil
rights movement, and for this reason
it has gained a wide and respectable
following. One would have supposed
that lawyers, trained in logic, and
the guardians of our legal system,
would have rallied promptly to de-
nounce civil disobedience as funda-
mentally inconsistent with the rule of
law. Yet most lawyers have remain-
ed silent, and of the few who have
expressed opinions a surprising num-
ber have written in justification. .. .

Most of what has been said and
written on this subject has related to

civil rights. This has inevitably
clouded perspective and prevented
dispassionate analysis. If it were

possible | would like. for the pur-
pose of this paper, to disassociate
civil disobedience from civil rights
and consider the doctrine solely on
its merits. Despite the fashion to the
contrary, one may understand and
condemn—as | certainly do—the in-
justices which initially provoked civil
disobedience without condoning or
approving a concept which in the
end could produce even greater in-
justices.

It is true that the Negro has had.
until recent years, little reason to re-
spect the law. The entire legal pro-
cess, from the police and sheriff to
the citizens who serve on juries. has
too often applied a double standard
of justice. Even some of the courts
at lower levels have failed to admini
ster equal justice. Although by no

means confined to the southern
states, these conditions—because of
the history, economic and social

structure of that region, and its pop
ulation mix—have been a way of
life in some parts of the South
Many lawyers. conforming to the
mores of their communities, have
generally tolerated all of this. often
with little consciousness of their
duty as officers of the courts. And
when lawyers have been needed to
represent defendants in civil right
cases, far too few have respond
cd

These conditions, which have sul
lied ovr proud boast of equal jus
tice tinder the law, set the stage for
the civil rights movement. Engrafted
thereon——both as a slogan
justification of tactics——was the
cept of civil disobedience. Articulat
ed by Martin Luther King in his
much publicized Letter from a Bir

and a

con

mingham Jail, this quickly gained
nationwide attention and support
outside of the South. It met the

needs of intellectuals and theologians
for a moral and philosophical justi

and to civil disobedience as a con

cept of general applicability

Nebuchadnezzar to the Boston Tea
Party and the American Revolution.
There have been many situations
in history where the tyranny of
regime has justified revolution .
The chances of success may be re-
mote—as the Freedom Fighters
found in Hungary—but few would
deny the moral right of a people to
overthrow tyrannical rule where no
other means of redress are available.
The American colonists were in that

position, and the product of their
courage is our present system of
government,

But the irrelevance of this type of
revolution as a precedent or moral

justification for civil disobedience
must be apparent, even to most of
those who rely on it. There is no

parallel situation in America today
where, despite some conditions of in-
justice, wrongs can be and ultimately
are redressed in the courts, the legis-
latures and through other established
political institutions, It must be re-
membered that revolution, conceptu-
ally and in fact, is outside of and
designed to supplant the existing
governmental system.

Henry David Thoreau and Gandhi
are relied upon as the modern in-
spiration and authority for civil dis-

obedience. One may wonder how
many of those who cite Thoreau
have actually read him Thor-

eau’s political philosophy is simply
a doctrine of anarchy.

Nor is Gandhi's heroic struggle
for India’s independence an_intel-
lectually honest precedent for civil
disodedience in America today. In-
dia was a colony, and Gandhi was
forced to use techniques of disobedi-
ence as democratic processes and
lawful remedies were wholly un-
available.

American precedents loosely in-
voked as justification for civil dis-
obedience include Shay’s Rebellion.
the Whiskey Insurrection, evasion of
the Fugitive Slave Law, and the
civil disorders in our labor move-
ment. These may prove that we have
had episodic disobedience of law
and even some violence in our past.
But they fall far short of any body
of genuine authority for a doctrine
which affirms the right of every man
in a representative democracy to
choose which laws he will obcy.

THE NATURAL LAW
CONCEPT

Ihe philosophical justification of
civil disobedience is even less im-
pressive to a lawyer than the mis-
cellany of precedents cited in its
behalf. In essence. it is that there is
a higher law than man-made law.
namely, the law of God or of na-
ee

But where does this philosophy
leave us in a complex modern soc-
iety governed by the rule of law? .. .
There is rarely a wide consensus,
much less unanimity, as to which
man-made laws are in fact just and
fair to all concerned. This diversity
becomes chaotic when we enter the
subjective realms of morality. God's
law and natural law

As has been observed:

lf the decision to break the law

really turns on individual con

science, it is hard to see in law

how Dr. King is any better off

than former Governor Ross

Barnett of Mississippi, who also

believed deeply in his cause and

was willing to go to jail

Whatever may be said for the
idealism of a view that permits each
man to apply his own predilection a
io a higher natural or moral law, it
affords no basis for a system of of

ganized society

and it also attracted—for the rea
sens indicated above—widespread
public and political support. It nev

ertheless resulted in a flood of ar
rests and litigation. Most of thin oc
curred prior to enactment of the
Civil Rights Aci of 1964, and

broadly speaking—two types of cases
reached om a Court: (i) sit
sated facilities. tesiing
ilk validiey | of alaie and local «

ifs ili <e

hon und anti trespass laws: and (i)

and it was—as

demonstrations, resulting in arrests
under “breach of peace” laws.

In all of these cases the Court re-
versed the convictions under state
or local laws, These results repre-
sent a striking vindication of some of
the tactics associated with disobedi-
ence, But the Court has been careful,
even in decisions which have pro-
foundly disturbed dissenting Justices,
to indicate limitations on these tac-
tics, and certainly there has been no
endorsement of civil disobedience as
a right or doctrine. . .

Two decisions of the Court, each
decided by 5 to 4 margins, merit
special attention, In Hamm v. City
of Rock Hill, the majority held that
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 abated
convictions of sit-in demonstrators
in an eating establishment covered
by the Act.

The majority opinion in Hamm
does indeed go far toward sanction-
ing certain disobedience tactics, rath-
er than resort to prescribed legal
means. This, it seems to me, is an
unnecessary and regrettable inter-
pretation of the Civil Rights Act.
But it is important to remember that
this sanction is limited to peaceful
(e.g., “non-forcible”) action in the
exercise of rights expressly conferred
by the public accommodations sec-
tion of the Act. There was no blan-

 

ket approval of sit-ins either gen-
erally or even to implement rights
under other provisions of the Act.

The second Supreme Court deci-
sion of special interest is Brown v.
Louisiana, in which convictions for
sit-ins at a public library were re
versed ...

There seems litthe doubt that the
Court would sustain the nondis
eriminatory enforcement of a
perly drawn statute regulating con
duct and prohibiting sit-ins or other
demonstrations in lbraries, In short,
the issue of racial discrimination
thence denial of equal protection)
was probably decisive Brown v.
Louisiana.

But even this rationalization leaves
Brown as an unwelcome and disturb
ing precedent. One would have hop
ed that libraries would be protected
from the disruption of all disobedi
ence tactics. including those direct
ed at racial discrimination

ESCALATION AND
PROLIFERATION

On another occasion | commented
that the frightening thing about civil
disobedience is that its use and tech-
niques tend inevitably to escalate. If
this is a justifiable concern, it is a
most serious one. Let us examine—
briefly as we must—the record.

Not Confined to “Unjust” Laws

Most of the court cases have in-
volved direct disobedience of state or
local laws deemed to be unjust...

But as the use of disobedience
tactics has expanded, the relation-
ship between the act of protest and
the law protested has become in-
creasingly attenuated. For example,
when James Farmer and _ other
CORE workers were arrested for lie-
downs at the World’s Fair in New
York, the breach of the peace law
they violated was not questioned .. .

Another example of indirect co-
ercion, involving organized violation
of admittedly valid and unjust laws,
is the school boycott used in New
York and elsewhere by Negroes to
protest failure to accelerate inte-
gration and by whites to protest bus-
ing of children from neighborhood
schools, Whether the protest was for
or against integration, the compul-
sory attendance laws were wilfully
and extensively violated to the detri-

ment of many thousands of inno-
cent children.
Not Confined to South

In its relatively short life civil dis-
obedience has become encrusted with
a number of myths. One of the more
persistent is that it is a doctrine con
fined, in its conception and applica-
tion, to conditions in the South . . .

Civil disobedience tactics undoub!
edly accelerated the pace of legisla-
tive reform. But the ultimate price of
ths acceleration may be costly in-
m terms of racial bitterness
and discord. and particularly in the
disrespect for law and order engen
dered and the lawlessness in the
streets which the doctrine of disobe
dience has encouraged. Moreover, if
our system is to survive, worthy ends
can never justify resort to unlawful
means

But one may view the
justification for its use, civil disobed
ence has not been limited either in
theory or in practice to the
South

The fact is that civil disobedience
has been preached and practiced in
all sections of the country. Many
eXamples come to mind: the sit-ins
in public and buildings. in
cluding those of the Governor of
New York. the Department of Jis
tiee and even the White House: the

ifitially the use of disobedience cc

November 3, 1971

curred predominantly in the civil
rights movement and its most arti-
culate advocates have been the lead-
ers of this movement.

Yet, just as its use has exploded
geographically across the country,
so have the “causes” proliferated,
First, the civil tights objectives have
broadened from specific diserimina-
tory laws and practices of the South
to the limitless problems of bias,
poverty and unemployment -every-
where. Other causes in which disob-
edience tactics have been used in-
clude such - sweeping subjects as
American policy in Vietnam, peace
generally, disarmament, control of
the poverty program, and the “par-
ticipatory democracy” now advocat-
ed by elements of the New Left. . .

Civil Disorder

The concept that civil disobedi-
ence is non-violent and peaceful—
indeed even “loving”—has been per-
vasively and skillfully woven into the
speeches and literature on this sub-
ject. It is fair to say that the more
responsible leaders of the civil rights
movement also have made a genu-
ine effort—and with considerable
success—to prevent serious disorders
in most of the organized demonstra-
tions.

This has resulted in a carefully
nurtured impression that disobedi-
ence is essentially a peaceful (non-
violent) procedure, resulting in little
or no disorder and practiced without
infringement of the rights of other
citizens, Like the other myths, this
impression will not stand eritical ex-
amination.

An unauthorized sit-in on public
or private property is normally a
trespass and a violation of law. It is
also “one of the surest ways anyone
can pick out to disturb the peace.”
This is especially true where groups
physically block or occupy, by sit-
ins or lie-downs, public offices and
private property. In short, a sit-in is
not a peaceful act and it frequently
provokes actual disorder. The Su-
preme Court has sustained the vali-
dity of civil rights sit-ins under the
circumstances discussed above, but
one may be confident that in a pro-
per non-civil rights case the Court
will reaffirm traditional concepts of
trespass and breach of peace...

Moreover, even the nonviolent
demonstrations frequently exact a
high price from the public generally.
They disrupt traffic, create discor-
dant noises, litter the streets, and
deny the streets and sidewalks to
other citizens .. .

The problem—and a very diffi-
cut one indeed where multitudes
take to the streets and are told that
only just laws need be obeyed—is to
strike a balance which preserves the
liberties of all. There is mounting
evidence of imbalance and that the
use of demonstrations is getting out
of hand.

Relationship te Riots

Possibly the most serious aspect
of the expanding use of protest
methods in the name of civil disobe-
dience is the resulting incitement to
mob violence. No one knows the
extent to which the doctrine of dis-
obedience, and especially the wide-
spread resort to the streets, has con-
tributed to the general deterioration
of respect for law and order and
specifically to major outhreaks—such
as riots in Harlem. Rochester, Phil-
wleiphia. Chicago and Watts
Yet few objective observers would
deny that the contribution has been
significant

The disquieting question is wheth-
er there will be further and more
serious outbreaks . . . It is possible
for the masses—especially the eco-
nomically deprived and emotionally

inflamed—to draw fine distinctions
between “just” and “unjust” laws or
between various methods of dis

obedience? Can we reasonably ex
pect throngs in the streets to under
stand and observe subtle differences
between peaceful protest. disorderly
conduct, and mob violence?

No one has warned against the
probable answers to these questions
more eloquently than Mr. Justice
Black

Experience demonstrates that it

* nota far step from what to

many seems the carnest. honest,

patriotic. kind-spirited multitude

of today to the fanatical

threatening. lawless mob of to
morrow. And the crowds that
press in the srecis for noble

eoals today can be supplanted
tomorrow by sireet mobs pres

suring for precisely opposite

11 Disobedience’

ends....

Although there can be no doubt
that civil disobedience has contribut-
ed significantly to lawlessness in the
streets, it is a justification rather
than a fundamental cause, The cen-
tral causes of unrest in urban slums
involve complex and deep-seated
social and economic problems. These
constitute, together with the related
problems of crime, the most serious
domestic crisis of this decade, |
have spoken of this, and the urgency
of an adequate poverty and educa-
tional program, on other occasions,
But this is a paper on civil disobedi-
ence, and my conviction is that due
process and democratic procedures,
even though painfully slow at times,
are a far more dependable and cer-
tainly less dangerous means of cor-
recting injustice and solving social
problems.

THE FUTURE: WHERE
DOES CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE
GO FROM HERE?

So much for a review—obviously
an incomplete one—of the origin,
characteristics and proliferation of
contemporary civil disobedience. It
is perhaps now appropriate to ask
where America may be headed—if
we continue on the widening path of
disobedience . . .

We are blessed in America by a
system of government which pro-
vides expressly for the accomplish-
ment of change by orderly processes.
The Constitution, both by amend-
ment and interpretation, has proved
to be a remarkably flexible and re-
silient charter of government and of
personal liberty. The street mob and
massive civil disobedience, so fami-
liar in countries not governed by the
rule of law, have had no place in our
country.

The question now being seriously
asked is whether we are making a
place for these techniques of coer-
cion and lawlessness. The record of
the past decade is sobering to anyone
concerned with due process. We
started with massive disobedience of
Supreme Court decisions by segrega-
tionists. The concept of disobedience
was then adopted and enlarged, far
more skillfully and effectively, by
integrationists in the civil rights
movement. More recently we have
witnessed an ever-growing diffusion
and expansion of the use of civil dis-
obedience, of the causes in which it
is employed, and in the character of
oe

Those drawn to civil disobedience
by the worthiness of causes might
reflect that the doctrine is urged as
one of universal application, with
its moral imperatives and techniques
available to all. If sit-ins and mas-
sive demonstrations are justified for
the “worthy” they are equally justifi-
ed for the “unworthy.” as under this
doctrine each man may determine
which laws are unjust, and each has
the “moral duty” to disobey them.
The fortunate fact that the Ku Klux
Klan has not yet engaged in massive
disobedience against civil rights leg-
islation suggests no unique respect
for law by Klansmen but rather a
lack of numerical strength and o:
ganization, elements which it could
acquire...

The logical and inescapable end of
civil disobedience is the destruction
of public order. and in the anarchy
which follows. all liberty would be
lost,

Although many voices still call. ir
responsibly [| think. for “enlarge-
ment of the role of civil disobedi
ence,” We may assume that most of
these would draw the line at some
point——if they could. But there may
be real doubt whether the forces
and passions already set in motion
can be reversed short of grave dam
age to basic values of a free «x
—_...

Moreover, the very rights and
ratses now sought to be vindicated
through these tactics can. in the end
be assured only so long as laws are
observed and due process followed
It has been wisely said that “min
orily groups are the ones who
always suffer the mosi when <ircet
multitudes are allowed to substitute
their pressures for the les« glamor
ous but more dependable and tem
perate processes of the law

The ultimate danger is to the rul
of law and the framework of govern
ment which sistains if Hit
has demorsirated thai once A un
ety condones organized defiance of
law and due process, it becomes in
creasingly difficull to protect its in
stitutions and to safeguard liberty

Generals’ Defense Shines
As Sewanee Falls, 21-14

For the first time in two years the
Generals put together a two game
varsity football win streak with a
21-14 decision over Sewanee last
Saturday. It was the second week in
a row that the Generals’ ground
game sparkled, while the passing at-
tack left quite a bit to be desired.

Once again, the defense played a
beautiful game, limiting the Tigers
to a meager 42 yards rushing and
forcing them to go to the air. That
effort also proved futile as Sewanee
Quarterback Walters completed only
8 of 34 attempts and threw two in-
terceptions.

WAL carried on its trend of being
a first half team, as they tallied all
21 points in the first two periods. In
fact, the Generals have been able to
produce a total of only seven second
half points through six games this
season.

The Blue got the first break of the
game late in the first period when

the Sewanee punter was forced to
run after getting a bad center snap.
Jon Markley caught him on the
Tiger 23, dropping him for a 22
yard loss, Fluharty then guided the
Generals in with the aid of his able
runners,

JoJo Martin put W&L ahead with
a burst off tackle for three yards
and the score. Doug Chase added
the PAT and with 2:27 left in the
first quarter the Generals were ahead
by a 7-0 margin.

Sewanee returned the kickoff to its
own 33, but that proved to be the
Tigers’ deepest advance. On the sec-
ond play from scrimmage, Sims
fumbled and Al McWhorter fell on
it for the Blue at the Sewanee 35.

Once again, through the combin-
ed efforts of Martin, Lat Purser, and
Jim Farrar, the Generals struck pay-
dirt with the final thrust coming on
a seven yard run up the middle by
Farrar. The point after was good,

giving W&L a 14-0 lead.

The third General score came in
the same period following another
Tiger error. A fumble gave them the
ball on the Sewanee 18, but two five
yard penalties pushed W&L back to
the 28. On third down and twenty,
Fluharty found Chappy Conrad
open in the end zone and hit him
with a scoring pass. With the extra
point, the Generals took a 21-0
lead with less than two minutes left
in the half,

Sewanee took the ball at their own
42 following the kickoff and drove
58 yards in nine plays. The extra
point was good, and at half time the
score stood at 21-7 in favor of the
Generals.

The second half turned into a de-
fensive battle as the Generals’ of-
fense stalled and gained but two first
downs in the final two periods. How-
ever, the Blue defense held the Tig-
ers to only one touchdown, that on
a 74 yard pass play, and W&L had
its second victory of the season.

Chappy Conrad continued his
good play with four receptions and
a 46.9 punting average.

The Generals will meet Southwes-
tern in a CAC game next Saturday
at Wilson Field in what promises to
be an excellent Parents’ Weekend

Generals Finish
Second Overall,
In Water Polo

BY CLIFF OVERCASH

Washington and Lee’s first water
polo team made a big splash at the
state tournament, held in Charlottes-
ville last Friday and Saturday. The
Generals finished second in a strong
field that included UVa., Lynchburg
College, Old Dominion, VMI, Rich-
mond, and William and Mary. The
Generals were undefeated in their
division, out-battling Lynchburg Col-
lege 16-10, Old Dominion 18-5, and
Virginia
Generals lost to a very strong UVa.

“A” team 12-9, Excellent defensive |
work kept UVa.’s high scoring of- }
fense below its average. The Wahoos {
had scored at least 22 goals in each |

previous game. The defensive success
was due largely to W&L’s goalie,
Senior Bim Clark, who was a un-
animous selection as All-State. An-
other All-State performer was fresh-
man captain Dick Barber, who scor-
ed 29 goals in the tournament, the
highest total of anyone there.

Even though it is was the first
state water polo meet, the response
was so good that it is certain to be-
come an annual event. Washington

LaRue’s

BY BOB “LASH” LARUE

“The University has announced
plans to build a $2.2 million addi-
tion to Doremus Gymnasium and to
construct a separate $500,000 field
house in the vicinity of Wilson Field
and its surrounding outdoor fields.”
April, 1969 issue of the
Washington and Lee Alumnus

Is the construction of a $500,000
field house in Washington and Lee’s
future? For that matter, is any field
house? As much as the Athletic De-
partment and a lot of students and
even some faculty would like to see
one built, the prospects for the
much-needed building are dim, What
started out as a promise in the spring
of 1969 has drifted into obscurity in
the fall of 1971.

It has been stated many times pre-
viously in this column that a multi-
purpose facility is virtually a neces-
sity. The structure would serve as a
headquarters for participants in eight
intercollegiate sports: football, base-
ball, lacrosse, track, soccer, cross-
country, golf and tennis, The field
house would provide indoor space
for instruction in these sports and
house locker and dressing facilities
for physical education classes and
athletic teams participating in out-
door programs.

Presently, the facilities beneath the
stadium are, in a word, detestable
Two shower areas force athletic par-
ticipants to wash in shifts; usually,
half of the sprinklers do not work or
emit a poor trickle. Drains clog
daily in the drafty premises; ath-
letes’ foot ranks behind pneumonia
as the most common ailment con-
nected with the facilities. Team gear
is crammed into spare corners as
adequate space is scarce. Who can
blame the freshmen (or anyone) who
gets turned off W&L athletics by
miserable facilities?

Why, then has the University been
dragging its feet on the field house
issue? According to Mr. Frank A.
Parsons, assistant to the President,
money is the biggest drawback. Most
funds are being channelled into the
prospective law school and the new
library. Mr. Parsons has also cited

the fact that winter weather is not so
inclement as to impede practice.
When asked about the possibilities of
renovating the stadium facilities,
Parson replied that the University
was hesitant to proceed until it had
decided on the field house’s future.

Thus, at present, the plans for a
new field house, or at least for re
modeling the stadium area, are in
limbo,

Money seems to be the question
(which | do feel it should be), what
are the possibilities of student amor-
tization or a bond issue? Granted,
with student amortization, the stand-
ard shell-type field house may have
to be discredited tor the less expen-
sive bubble variety, like the one in
use of Harvard, which go for around
$150,000. But, such an edifice could
be quickly paid off by charging
each student and faculty member
five dollars a year. Student amortiza-
tion of this type has worked success-

For almost two years now, the
student body has been a bit misled,

For reasons which it has deemed
sufficient, the University has decided
not to build the promised field

house, nor does the University foster
immediate plans for such a structure
in the future. How can this be jus-
tified?
