Honor Study:
“Weekly Report’

After about three weeks of in-
terviews, the first phase of the
honor system study is almost com-
plete. This phase was structured to
gather opinions and observations
through interviews with various
members of the faculty and ad-
ministration at Washington and Lee.
From here, the study will move
on to interview both people from

other schools — representatives of
the University of Virginia, for
example, will be interview today
—and, most importantly, members
of the W&L student body itself.
It is this last series of interviews

which is expected to yield the most
result, since the present honor sys-
tem is designed, in its own words.
to reflect the values of the “stu-
dent generation involved.” There
are. of course, informative observa-
tions to be gained from inierview-
ing faculty, past students, and stu
dents from other schools; however,
the end product of this study, what
ever that may be. must finally draw
most heavily on the ideas of the
students at Washington and Lee
today, or clse this study will not
reilect the very attitudes that are
supposed to form the backbone of
the henor system itself,

To report on some of the observa
collected to date—one point
continues to receive almost
universal mention is the point of
indoctrination. Practically everyone
interviewed so far has stressed that

frous

which

‘if an honor system such as the one
navy at Washineton and Lee is to
survive. that thorough indoctrina-

ticn is necessary. This area has
impressed several people as beine
somewhat weak in recent years. and
several have suggested that many
of the system's current problems
may stem from faulty or incomplete
indoctrination,

In the area of procedural change
ene suggestion has been made with
regard to public student body hear-
ings. The opinion was expressed
that some recent public student body
hearings have had a somewhat
circus-like atmosphere. tending to
hinge on histrionics rather than the
facts at hand. For this reason. it
was suggested that in the event
of a student's appeal to a public
hearing, the Executive Committee
should randomly select twelve and
only twelve students to serve in its
place. This new group would com-
pletely rehear the case without the
presence of any other students
(Executive Committee included) with
the possible exception of the student
body president, whose sole purpose
would be to act as an impartial
agent of procedure. No official
counsel would be allowed either
side, and the group would rule on
the case with the exact powers of
the original Executive Commitice
This procedure would, it was felt
preserve the right of appeal to the
student body while avoiding a situa-
tion which could be inconducive to
a fair hearing.

This is only one suggestion which
has come out of the faculty inter
views; there is much more material

to be gone over and assessed by
the study group, From here, the
honor system study moves on to

interviews with students from other
schools, and finally, to interviews
with WAL students themselves

will be sold on the premises.

While Dance Board officials are
confident of a large turnout for
the Fancy Dress Ball, they are wor-
ried about the possiblility that stu-
dents will try to bring their own
drinks and flasks into the dance.
This is expressly forbidden because
the beer sold at the dance, it will
be sold by the authority of ARA's
liquor license for the Cockpit.
Should the license be revoked this
Saturday for any infraction of the
state liquor laws, the Cockpit would
lose its license. The result is that
if anyone is seen at the ball with
any kind of drink or bottle othe:
than the beer being sold, he will
either be removed from his bottle,
removed from the dance or both.

W&L: Where It Has Been, Where It Is Going .. .

W&L Faculty: How Competent Is It?

By JOHN ROBINSON

About 130 men and women make
up Washington and Lee’s faculty.
In recent years W&L has pointed
with pride to its faculty as one
of the school’s strongest academic
assets. The purpose of this article
is to evaluate how good the faculty
is; how it can improve and to reveal
some of the inner workings of this
body.

“Washington and Lee maintains
a strong faculty, so says the Wash-
ingtow and Lee Bulletin. This Uni-
versity publication emphasizes sev-
eral outstanding features of the
faculty: a large number of Ph.D.,s,
financial assistance for research,
liberal leave policy, youth, and
good salaries.

Such a declaration is expected
from an institution of higher learn-
ing. Would you anticipate any school

saying it maintained a weak faculty?
But what do educators say about
the faculty at W&L?

In 1966 a Visiting Committee
from the Southern Association of
Colleges and. Schools submitted a
report on W&L. That report, com-
piled over five years ago, said, “In
general the Visiting Committee
found the faculty of the University
competent for and. dedicated to its
task of providing outstanding educa-
tional opportunities for the students
of Washington and Lee there
is evidence of successful: teaching,
productive scholarship and re-
search, and - effective participation
in professional associations and
scholarly societies (there is)
an excellent spirit of freedom among
the faculty.”

Dr. James Leyburn, a former
Dean of the College, has been cited

 

| QUTLOOK and REVIEW

Wednesday, February 9, 1972

In a terribly trivial manner Washington and Lee has out-

grown its innocence. Recall the days when male W&L stu-

dents felt that there was at least one refuge of total masculine

supremacy

Doremus Gymnasium, Not many semesters ago

a W&L man could saunter unabashed and unclothed through-

out the labyrinth of Doremus’ locker room, If one felt a degree

of modesty, a towel quickly dispelled any chance of embar-

rassment, But the epitome of that era of innocence was skinny-
dipping in the tranquil waters of the school pool.
But alas, that age has passed. As other great. and not so

ereat, W&L traditions

have

vanished, so has swimming

“buck” (as the vernacular goes). The Athletic Department
has proclaimed that such an endeavor is an act of heresy in
the NEW $3,000,000 Doremus. Strangely, towels are no longer
de rigueur among the surrounding sweatshirts, lockers and
benches. Clothes must be worn. Perhaps, gentlemen should

not ever become naked. Or perhaps, the seasonal wave of

coed-mania has led everyone to suspect (or wish) women

are behind every corner and column,

Fellow W&L gentlemen, it seems a bit absurd. What pos-

sible harm does swimming naked entail? After all, as was

first mentioned in this passage, it is such a trivial matter. Yet

one must ponder if our institution has achieved such a cosmo-

politan level that this tiny bit of innocence must be sacrificed ?

Two years ago American campuses erupted over the U.S.

invasion of Cambodia. Several prestigious universities closed

their doors for the remainder of the spring. Kent State was

a tragic example of the violence that. developed at some
schools. The editor of the Daily Princetonian, proposed that
instead of revolting against the system, why not work within

the electoral system?

Princeton supported this concept of allowing its students

to utilize the existing system to facilitate change. The re-

sult was the “Princeton Plan.” It allowed for a class break

hefore the November, 1970 elections. Princeton students could

participate in election campaigns. Similar election recesses

were instigated by other institutions of higher learning.
\ccording to the New York Times the “Princeton Plan”
is dead, The Times reviewed a Princeton Alumni Weekly

article entitled “Princeton Plan, R.1P."

The piece explained

that the faculty defeated a proposal for the possible 1972

remstatement of the plan by a vote of 97 to 36. No student

protest was voiced,

Three factors combined to put the

“Princeton Plan” in a

premature grave: cost, time and apathy

During the 11 day break

in 1970,

400 athletes had te

remain at the school because of fall sports. The bill was $53,

715, Also as a result of the election break, summer recess was
curtatled. This move cost the students an estimated $300,000

in wWayes from summer jobs,

The time argument was presented primarily by faculty

inembers

schedule.

They said a “Swiss cheese effect” resulted from the

\pathy was a key rationale for scrapping the “Princeton

Plan.”

\ 1970 poll indicated that 25 per cent of the students

were actually involved in campaigning. The Princeton Alumni
Weekly article observed that student interest in this upeom

iw « lection was

“all but nonexistent.”

\ithough the story will not make the Education Page of

the Times, a parallel phenomenon has occurred at Washing

as an “Outstanding Educator in
America.” The Professor of Soci-
ology is largely recognized as being
responsible for some of the basic
upgradings in the faculty. He stated,
“One of the first things to impress
me here was that full professors
taught classes at every level, especi-
ally freshmen classes. | came from
Yale, and the teaching was. better
here than at Yale. There is a great
deal of response or give and take
due to the small classes. Profes-
sors know from class reactions
when they are getting across.”

The president of W&L’s chapter
of the American Association of Uni-
versity Professors, Dr. Milton Col-
vin, adheres to the belief that our
faculty is quite outstanding. He
commented, “We have a_ strong
willed and strong minded faculty.
We are the envy of all schools in
the Commonwealth, One reason is
that we have a very institutionally
loyal faculty.

A strong faculty is similar to a
strong student body in at least one
essential sense. That is recruitment.
An excellent faculty will wither and
die unless a concentrated, conscienti-
ous and continuing effort is made to
acquire and retain new teachers.

According to the Southern As-
sociation of Colleges and Schools,
“The institution has a good plan
for the recruitment and selection of
faculty. Its salary scale is  suffici-
ently flexible and adequate to permit
employment and retention of the
strong individuals needed to up-
grade the faculty.” The Association's
1966 report also states, “The aca-
demic preparation of the faculty is
good. The members hold degrees
from a variety of excellent uni-
versities.”

The mechanics of hiring and fir-
ing professors is centered in each
academic department. The appro-
priate academic dean approves the
hiring recommendations from each
department. In addition the Presi-
dent of the University meets and
accepts each candidate before he
or she is hired.

Where do the faculty come from?
There is a trend for W&L profes-
sors to attend southern undergradu-
ate institutions. The largest faculty
contingent calls WA&L its alma
mater. Exactly 25 per cent of last
year’s faculty attended W&L. Other
undergraduate institutions that pro-
duced several of our faculty mem-
bers include: UNC, Davidson,
Oberlin, Virginia, Duke, and Har-
vard. When you review the graduate
schools that the faculty attended,
you. discover that over a_ third
went to at least one of four uni-
versities: UNC, Virginia, Harvard,
and Columbia. Eight professors
went to law school or graduate
school at W&L (the University had
a master’s program at one time).
Considerably more faculty mem-
bers went to Ivy League graduate
schools than attended Ivy League
undergraduate schools, One trend is
obvious——-W&L has a considerable
number (32) of alumni faculty.

Anther trend is quite marked in
faculty hiring at W&L. The Uni-
versity almost exclusively _ hires
white. male teachers. Only two
women are teaching faculty mem-
bers; no blacks are on the faculty
even though the school has been
integrated for four years,

The pair of female faculty mem-
bers, Dr. F. H. Gray of the Biology
Department and Miss Margaret
Brown of the Psychology Depart
ment, do not have tenure, Both are
temporary. Neither feels W&L dis
criminates against women teachers
Dr. Gray said, “I think people
should be hired on their ability. If
women are qualified they should
be hired like men. In many cases
men get the jobs because people
feel men will stay with the job
longer, even though statistics doen't
bear this out.” Miss Brown is at

W&L only for the winter and spring
terms. She commented, “I'm very
happy with the teaching set-up. It
seems, if W&L hired me, it can-
not be negative to women; if it's
appropriate and the women = are
qualified, then they can be hired.”

Dean of the College, William
Watt expressed his view on. the
female faculty member shortage, “I
have no definite plans to hire a
woman for the faculty, but I have
no definite plans not to. There are
no restrictions of race, sex, or relig-
ion whatsoever in hiring.”

Once a teacher joins the faculty,
tenure becomes important. Perhaps
in an oversimplification, tenure can
be defined as a teacher's job security.
Tenure insures a professor of his
position and income. A key group
that watchdogs the tenure system
nationwide is the American Associ-
ation of University Professors.
(AAUP). The Southern Association
of Colleges and Schools 1966 re-
port concluded that, “In regard to

the field; (7) willingness to review
courses and undertake new  techni-

(humor),

“Judgment of a faculty member's
intellectual achievement should in-
clude the following considerations:

equivalent terminal degree (2) pub-
lished books, articles, and reviews

equivalent; (3) scholarly activity
leading to greater breadth and depth
in courses taught; (4) general intel-
lectual development and_ interests;
(5) papers to professional societies,
or the equivalent; (6) stimulation of
the work of colleagues both within
and outside the University; (7) sum-
mer study or teaching; 8) office-

cieties,

tenure the general recommendations
of the AAUP are followed by the
University.”

Closely linked with tenure is the
problem of promotions. Washing-
ton and Lee adopted a “University-
wide Policy on Salaries, Reappoint-
ments, and Promotions” in February
of 1971. This document provides
the prime criteria for promotion
as well as salary increases. Accord
ing to this policy statement, “Every
faculty member should be a good
academic citizen, loyal to the Uni-
versity with freedom of thought
and expression, ready to cooperate
with other faculty members, willine

Linked with the University's
policy on promotion is a schedule
of compulsory retirement. In order
to make room for promotions and
io encourage youth, all department
heads and administrative officers
must retire at 65. Retired depart-
ment heads and other professors
may continue to teach until 70

ous promotions in the eyes of many
is from teacher to dean. Although
this form of promotion falls under

ip cent for a “xine profes aire

for both assistant professors and

instructors,

Dr. Colvin added some insight
to these AAUP figures, Colvin said,
“Only two thirds of the colleges
and universities submit their salary
figures to the AAUP. So, compari-
sons of salaries are not exact. In
general W&L has the second high-
est salaries in the Commonwealth,
Only the University of Virginia pays
more. Most schools in the South
pay lower teaching salaries than
schools in other sections of the
country. So for the South W&L
ranks high, with only Vanderbilt,
Duke, UNC, and Virginia offering
better salaries, It must be remem-
bered that universities with gradu-
ate schools ordinarily pay better.
Cne thing is certain, W&L ranks
within the top 100. colleges in
America in faculty salaries,”

In addition to W&L’s salaries, the
University offers a retirement plan
and lucrative fringe benefits. The
Southern Association of Colleges
and Schock, cited these benefits in
its 1966 report on W&L: “Financial
sec. rity is provided for the faculty
by an excellent program of fringe
b_o-fits to supplement the salaries.”

Some of the most salient issties
facing the faculty are handled by
faculty committees. One criticism
that a younger faculty member voic-
ed was the predominance of W&L
alumni on the most inflential com-
mittees. Checking with the Wash-
ington and Lee University Bulletin
1971-72, this claim was confirmed
to a certain extent, Last year’s Fac-
ulty Advisory Committee consisted
of 50 per cent WAL alumni (how-
ever three of the six members were
selected ex officio) The Faculty
Executive Committee was made up
of one quarter W&L men (again
four of the eight members were
selected ex officio), The faculty
representation on the Student Affairs
Committee last year was 60 per
cent alumni. The point being made
by the criticizing professor was that
teachers from undergraduate schools
other than W&L seem to be neglect-
ed on policy formulation commit-
tees. One faculty member, a WAL
alumnus, felt that this phenomenon
was understandable. He said an
alumnus would inherently be more
interested in committee work al
his alma mater than someone from
outside the university.

What happens when a faculty
member is dissatisfied with a situation
existing on campus? What grievance
aliernatives are available? Accord-
ing to Dr. Milton Colvin a pair of
routes exist. The first route is to
work within the local AAUP. “A
faculty member asks the organiza-
tion to speak with the President,”
Colvin explained. “During the three
terms that Ive been president of
the chapter, I've been to President
Cole and President Huntley about
half a dozen times. Each problem
was quickly and satisfactorily re
solved. | might add to my amuse-
ment, er annoyance, that each in-
stance involved a non-union man.”

The second pattern of grievance
setilement according to Colvin is
guaranteed by the faculty by-laws.
If a person with tenure is fired,
then that person is entitled to a
trial by a jury of his or her peers.

Washington and Lee prides itself
on a close student-faculty relation
ship and small classes. The size of
the faculty is a vital factor in
boih cases. What is the student
fuculity relationship here and at
other places? That depends entirely
on whe is classified as a faculty
member, Some institutions classify
their school lecturers as
fucully. Lovejoy’s guide to colleges

By LEX McMILLAN

Like a giant geometric leviathan
the new structure stands firmly if
somewhat incongruously amidst the
classic lines of Greek Revival archi-
tecture and the graceful curves of
the Shenandoah’s natural endow-
ment, Its recent arrival is reflected
in the surrounding ground which still
loudly mourns its scars. But hidden
within this youthful intruder is a
world of wonders and an invitation
to new adventures. Walking in
familiar entrances one recognizes
old sites which have been face-
lifted, This serves as a transitional
buffer to the complete newness
which lies further in,

Passing through the same old
locker room and glancing aside you
notice the familiar showers you've
used since you first arrived, The
characteristic smell of chlorine mix-
ed with the steam and sweat
weighted air indicates that the pool
you plunged into from the fore-
boding balcony still remains, Then
you notice the dead end that was,
is dead no longer, Indeed, a verit-
able cornucopia of athletic — life
greets you enveloped in shiny new
glass, bold steel beams, highly
polished woods and all the extras
that modern man has devised. In
short, you are in the new gym.

A bold addition to the campus
costing well over three million dol-
lars, it will inevitably affect a
change in campus life. The staff has
already noticed the influx of new
faces, new spare tires and new
muscles, It seems quite likely that
the new gym will spark a rebirth
of enthusiasm for physical pursuits.

This new interest in the physical
has a mildly comical side. Most
of you are aware that there has
been some criticism leveled at the
administration for this particular
undertaking. You know the kind:
“We need a new library, a new
Law School, a new building for the
‘C’ School and what do we g7t.
a new gym!” or maybe this com-
ment; “The P.E. department is one
of the largest in the University, as
long as we're building a new gym
why not have a major in P.E.” or
better yet: “I came here to learn,

 

“Letting Go”’

RERAEA LEGA EGE

to gain knowledge, not to be a
jock; I could’ve gone to ie
State if I wanted to be a jock.
They're wasting my tuition on a
gym” (indignant tone), I’m sure
you've heard them all and I won't
attempt to argue with these com-
ments. The funny thing is that a lot
of these “anti-bodies” are finding
themselves enamored with the broad
spectrum of facilities contained in
the new gym.

You can see these former com-
plainers turning into jocks before
your very eyes. Two buddies (who
alt some time in the recent past
had sat in the Cockpit bemoaning
the distorted priorities of the Uni-
versity reflected in the building of
the new gym) run into each other
in the locker room. As the first
student pulls on his handball gloves
his friend rounds the corner sweat-
ing and trembling having just
emerged from a forty minute Sauna.
The ensuing conversation consits of
nervous laughs and some passing
comment aobut ‘jocking-it-up’, ete.

The point is that this new gym
is an alvantageous and peneficial
addition to the University. It may
serve to re-emphasize the signific-
ance of developing your body as
well as your mind, This is nothing
new, the Greeks of the Sth century
B.C. were enthusiastic in their pur-
suit of this sort of balanced life.

Those who have eagerly anticipat-
ed the completion of the gym know
that the final completion has be-
come an enigmatic figure always
just around the corner. This has
caused frustration for all concerned.
Now that the gym is almost com-
pleted it is becoming clear what
type of facility we have and what
the range of its offerings are. Un-
questionably the range is impressive.

However, now that we can get in
there and actually use the facilities,
certain problems are arising which
interfere with the fullest possible
use of the new gym. For instance,
the basket system is set up with
open backs so that they could be
serviced with periodic laundering
and a regular change of the towels,
yet this is not done. It you want

Price of Beer To Be
Reduced On Wednesdays

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

I wish to inform the student body
that beginning Wednesday, February
16, beer will be reduced to 15 cents
a glass in the Cockpit from 4 until
6 p.m. This policy was decided
upon by Mr, Sumner, manager of
the Cockpit, working in conjunction
with the University Center Comit-
tee,

We hope that the student body
will take advantage of these special
prices, and make this relaxing, mid-
week break a regular habit,

Sexual Segregation, Is It
Different From Racial?

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Imagine that the year is 1965
and a debate is raging at W&L as
to whether the university should
open its doors to black students, In
a letter to the Phi, a student makes
the following comments:

“Washington and Lee offers a
choice that fewer and fewer col-
leges are offering—the choice to
attend an all-white school. There
is a very wide choice of integrated
schools and an_ increasingly nar-
rower choice of segregated insti-
tutions, Anyone who wants to go
to an integrated school has more
than enough opportunity.

“Also a long term view must be
taken about alumni donations, Per-
haps one could study the alumni aid
of Howard and Tuskegee and see
whether it compares favorably with
our alumni gifts. My guess is that
black alumni would not give as
much because most blacks take jobs

 

Blows Against The Empire

as janitors and shoeshine boys,

_ “A white outlook is the nature of
this institution in the same way
an athletic viewpoint is the nature
of the NFL. To argue that it is
‘unreal’ is irrelevant; one might as
well argue that our society has an
unreal atmosphere because the white
outlook predominates,”

These are, of course, the argu-
ments advanced by Nick Wreden’s
letter of last week, and the sub-
ject was women, not blacks. If Mr.
Wreden’s points are valid, however,
they are equally valid as to both,
Yet no one has been heard lately
advocating that W&L resegregate in
order to provide a “unique” haven
for the racist point of view, The
reason is that there is a consensus
today that racial segregation was
wrong; even the Richmond Times-
Disgrace pays lip service to it.

The question | would like to ask
Mr. Wreden and the other op-
ponents of coeducation, and the
question they will have to answer to
change my stand on the issue, is
this: How is sexual segregation dif-
ferent from racial segregation?

Geographical Distribution
A Source of Diversity?

The time has come again for me
to get oul my pen and express
my views. They are on three cur-
rent topics.

missions at W&L, the advantage of
wide geographical representation of
the student body was given strong
emphasis (“national” in boldface),

State Of The Uni on

By W. PATRICK HINELY

Since | myself am not an expert
economist, | shall quote one who
is. He is Karl Schiller, Finance
Minister of West Germany, a nation
which has come a long way since
1945, Last month, he told the West
German Parliament that the nations
of the world should institute a multi-
national monetary system, since the
U.S. dollar is no longer capable of
supporting the economies of the
Western world.

Schiller didn’t even explore the
possibilities of a truly GLOBAL
monetary system, which would in-
clude the nation which is destined
to become the next superpower as
the U.S. fades a bit from the
scene: the People’s Republic of
China, But then, people who are
really into money can only see so
far.

In Schiller’s words, “Monetary
policy must become free of the
accidents of the American balance of
payments,” We're not so perfect
after all, On January 28 last, Uncle
Walter told us on CBS News that
the USSR had outproduced the U.S.
in steel during 1971. The figures
were 132.8 million tons for the
Russkies to our 120 million tons.
During 1971, the U.S. also ended
up in the red in world trade for
the first time in history.

Could all this mean something
significant?

The British people came to a
great shock when they realized that
the sun was indeed setting on their
empire. However, they have since
accepted their place in a com-
munity of nations, They have finally
been admitted to the Common
Market, which means the British are
being accepted by their neighbors
on an equal basis. (As soon as they
give the people of Northern breland
a free voice in deciding their civil

affairs, they'll be in pretty good
shape.)

The U.S. isn’t in quite as com-
promised a position yet, but the
figures | cited above are indications
that our once unquestioned world
superiority is crumbling. Can we as
a people accept that?

| certainly hope so, and would
strongly recommend it. The fool-
ishly proud “we're the best and it's
my country right or wrong” attitude
which seems to permeate the Penta-
gon can get us into a lot of
trouble. With the nuclear weapons
at our disposal, we are capable of
destroying the world. Of course.
once we start, we'll have plenty of
help from Russia, China, and then
there are our allies who will natur-
ally want to get their own two
megatons into the game.

This is only a possibility, We also
have the choice of turning the
Pentagon on its side and painting it
purple and green and then using
the power we have left to persuade
the world, through respect and
example rather than money and
coercion that we are indeed what
some Americans in the past have
claimed we are: the greatest nation
in the history of man.

A few years ago, some “weirdo”
types started yelling at us from
obscure places like Greenwich Vil-
lage and various progressive cam-
puses (most of which, by the
way, are coed . . .) that we should
stop our materialistic rat race and
start examining the QUALITY of
our lives. This is the old maxim of
“quality, not quantity.” Lyndon
Johnson envisioned this in his
“Great Society,” but being too
human, he got into Vietnam too
deeply, and we are still triyng to
get out of that one,

But you can't say he didn't try
Nor was he the first, It is up to
us to see that he wasn't the last

scores of ways. A recent (1970)
example was the decision of Ivy
League colleges in the United
States to de-emphasize geogra-
phical considerations in their ad-
missions policies . . . Between
the 1930's and the 1950's, for
example, Harvard cut in half the
percentage of its students from
homes in New England and New
York. Today, says an official of
the university, “We're pulling back
on this geographical distribution
thing.”

Place is now recognized as no
longer a primary source of di-
versity . . . Says the dean of
admission of Yale, ... Yale
has virtually dropped geography
altogether as a consideration in
selection. And his counterpart at
Princeton reports: “It is not the
place they're from, really, but
rather some sense of a different
background that we're looking
for,”

Second, the pros and cons of
coeducation at W&L. My _ biggest
complaint is that there are no coeds
here, but this school’s outstanding
qualities and my getting accustomed
to this place has kept me _ here.
| had thought, “sure, girls would
be nice here”, because that would
make things better for me. Yet now
I realize that W&L should maintain
its distinctiveness and offer an al-
ternative to coeducation. I don’t
feel an all-male school is better,
but | think that that is W&L’s
role,

Third, a student last week com-
plained of inadequate parking space
on campus and pleaded for more
spaces. I believe a better point of
view is that there are too many
cars, And there are probably too
many spaces already, This campus
can be degraded like any city by
being overwhelmed by cars. If only
necessary cars were on campus —
those of dorm residents, of people
who live far away, and of visitors—
then, I believe, parking would be
easy. Walking and bicycling could
substitute, and be good for you too,

Gary Sprunk, °72

A Matter of Ethics

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:
| am writing this letter both as
a member of Students for Coeduca-
tion and as an individual deeply
concerned about Washington and
Lee and it’s future. Above all other
matters, coeducation is the most
pressing issue we face, The major
component of this issue has been
lost in the discussion of Plans I
and Il, dormitory space, curricular
design, etc. The issue is one of
philosophy and ethics, not eco-
nomics and logistics. No one is ask-
ing Washington and Lee to be-
come coeducational without plan-
ning for it so that the best interests
of the university are met. All that
is secondary to the examination of
our educational philosophy and the
morality of an all male school.

I quote from the official educa-
tional philosophy of this university.

“Fundamental to all other as-
pirations of Washington and Lee
are two basic purposes:

—the dedication of all its re-
sources to the development of
man’s capacity and desire to learn,
to understand, and to pass on to
others the varied benefits of this
intellectual growth.

—the pursuit of its educational
purpose in a climate of learning
that stresses the importance of the
individual, his personal honor and
integrity, his harmonious relation.
ship with his fellow man, and his
responsibility to serve society
through the productivity of his

training and his talent,”

The admission of women to this
university would require no change
in this philosophy. What it would
mean is that at last Washington
and Lee will begin to practice that
philosophy. The exclusion of women
as a group contradicts the emphasis
we put on the individual. It contra-
dicts our interest in learning and
understanding when we intention-
ally restrict women from participat-
ing in the learning environment, We
have limited our intellectual and

Dicantintaininieein iiss nia died

Odds and ends put together while
reflecting on last Saturday's halftime
show . the W&L Athletic De-
partment is rightfully concerned by
the latest show of Women’s Libera-
tion. As you've probably heard,
girls have been showering with boys.
mixed couples have been entertain-
ing themselves in the sauna, and
girls, naturally attired, have been
seen riding the gym elevators . . .
To combat this problem, members
of the coaching staff are taking
shifts policing the area, especially
the elevators Meanwhile, a
number of girls have complained
about the lack of facilities for
the females . . . And speaking of
saunas, a big midwestern school is
having similar problems in which
couples have been taking advantage
of the salubrious effects of the
Swedish steam practice One
of the best deals that the Athletic
Department has set up is the $42
skiing deal with The Homestead
Not only can students get a lesson
and a day on the slopes for about
$7 «a shot, but they get gym
credit The average cost for
a day, without lessons, for anyone
else is $10.50. . . At those savings,
who can complain? Hats off and a
big round of thanks to all those
who made last Saturday's WLUR-
Ring-tum Phi half-time  extraxa
ganza. John Hughes as the refree

was particularly entertaining
And the rumor running around the
Phi office is that a re-match is
inevitable . . . The second best
show of the night was a_ perform-
ance by Emory and Henry’s coach,
“Arnold.” Although his childish
chair-kicking, which netted him a
technical foul is not to be con-
doned, Arnold nevertheless had a
legitimate complaint. The umpiring
last Saturday night was some of the
most atrocious this writer has seen
in four years at W&L ... As a
matter of fact, the entire season
seems to be marked by an over-all
decline in the quality of the referees,
in Which all teams have suffered
Maybe the Minnesota affair
involving the suspension of Corky

79-72 Lynchburg Loss fo
Gives W&L 12-6 Mark

By PALMER TRICE

fhe Generals saw their undefeat-
ed college division in-state record
go down the drain in a thriller on
Monday night, 79-72,

The opponents were the Lynch-
burg Hornets, who stormed back
from the brink of disaster to catch
the Blue in the second half. The

game was good, the crowd was
right, but the Generals couldn't
come up with the killer instinct

when they need it.

Last Wednesday’s contest with
Hampden-Sydney proved even
tougher than many had figured, The
Tigers, playing at home, came up
with a fine game, and took the
visitors into overtime, before drop-
ping a 78-75 decision. The game
was marked by three technicals, one
each on the respective coaches, and
one on the Tigers big center,
Burness.

The Generals led at the half by
four, 36-32. With 9:10 remaining
in the game, Hampden-Sydney tied
the score at 53, At the 5:30 mark,
the score was knotted at 58 apiece.
With six seconds in the regular
playing time, guard Charlie Strain
missed a foul shot. Burness hauled
down the rebound, and called time
out. The Tigers, stifled by the Gen-
eral defense, failed to get off a shot
in regulation.

Early in the overtime period, the
Generals fell behind by four. They
took the lead for the: first time
with 1:48 remaining, 71-70, on a
Doug Clelan jumper. Skip Lichtfuss
added two more, and the Generals
final margin of three occurred. The
Hoopers employed a match-up de-
fense, mixed in with a full court
press. Coach Canfield was proud

of his ball club, “They kept their
poise.”

Saturday night saw the Generals
come up on the long end of another
thriller. Emory and Henry came to
town with revenge on the brain,
They almost got what they came
for. The game was much closer
than the final 75-73 score indicated.

The Blue fell behind the Wasps
early. In the season’s first encounter,
Emory and Henry had dropped a
93-72 decision to the Generals.
When the visitors grabbed an early
19-14 lead, many in Doremus were
surprised, including the Generals,
Not too surprised, the home team
stormed back, using a good fast
break, to grab a 45-38 lead at the
half.

The game stayed tight through-
out the second half. The Wasps

grabbed the lead for the first time,
at the 7:06 mark in the second half.
Charlie Strain put the Generals
back in front on two foul shots,
72-71, with 1:46 remaining in the
game. Doug Clelan’s foul shots
boosted the Blue lead-to four, 75-71,
and gave them the insurance tallies
that they needed to offset a last
second basket by the Wasps. The
game was marred by many tense
calls, one of which prompted the
E&H coach to kick over one of
the chairs in his bench. This one
might have been more of a squeaker
than the one in Death Valley.
Mike Daniel, as usual, led the
Generals. He had 28 points, and
14 rebounds, Paul McClure added

“Letting Go”

(Continued from page 3)
clean gym clothes you take them
out and do them yourself else-
where. The gym does offer you a
clean towel as frequently as you
desire to change it. Of course you
can only change it when the equip-
ment room is open and that is from
am. to 6 p.m. Monday thru
Friday. This points out another
problem and that is the equipment
room's limited availability. It is
never open in the evenings nor on
the weekends. The same is true for
the pool. The old pool can be used
only when the equipment room is
open, The new pool is not yet open

at all to the campus public.

Thus, it is clear that the total
utilization of the new gym is hamp-
ered. What is the central problem
behind this? In talking with Mr.
McHenry, the Director of Athletics,
last week, the one main obstacle to
greater use of the gym appeared to
be too few personnel. People are
needed to man the equipment room,
to handle laundering and to life-
guard the pools before the gym
can expand the availability of its
facilities. Mr. McHenry pointed out
that the gym is for the entire
campus community, not just the
athletes, It is his desire to make the
sym as available as reason allows.
But he also points out the simple
logistical reality of the thousands of
square feet that have to be cared
for by the custodial staff,

The lack of adequate staffing ts
attested to by dusty handball courts
and corridors, absence of soap in
the showers and muddy floors in the
shower area. This is not meant to
criticize but simply to point out
that the gym needs more manpower.
Of course, part of the problem will
be eliminated when the gym ts
officially turned over the University
by the contractors and the workmen
leave the building. But, undoubtedly
the Athletic Department will need a
lareer custodial staff if the Uni
versity community is to fully benefit
from the new gym. As long as we've
eone this far, we might as well
ro 6a little further to make the
facility optimally functional.

Another issue which is of interest
to an ever-growing minority is the
question of facilities for women.
Mr. McHenry has informed me that
a very large and comfortable locke!
room is being prepared for the
women at WAL. It is located on
the first floor next to the pool in
the Northwest corner of the build-
ing. Mr, McHenry hesitated to name

date for completion because of
the many delays he has already ex-
perienced. However, after looking
over the room, it was clear that the
completion shouldn't be too far in
the future

Mr. McHenry expressed his in
terest in knowing what students are
thinking and noted that he wel-
comes suggestions for improving the
eym's capabilities. The new gym: is
in good hands and it will un-
doubtedly broaden the spectrum of
WAL’s attractive features. However,
it is clear that certain rough edges
need smoothing. It would. be. a
shame to fail to carry the possibili-
ties to their reasonable ends and
stunt the young gym's growth and
development
