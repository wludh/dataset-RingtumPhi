nauguration:

Official “Tip-Off’ Tonight

Washington and Lee's Doremus
Gymnasium addition, a project offi-
cially announced in March of 1969,
will be inaugurated tonight with a
basketball game against the powerful
University of Virginia Cavaliers,

A whole series of special events,
including a tip-off ceremony, and an
open house will highlight the even-
ing’s activities.

Virginia, on the rise in Atlantic
Coast Conference circles, will be a
rugged opponent for the gym’s open-
ing encounter. The Cavaliers went
15-11 last year, their first winning
season in 17 campaigns. Coach Bill
Gibson is blessed with a strong re-
turning cast, including a proven big
man in 6'10° Scott McCandlish and
a strong All-American candidate in
junior guard Barry Parkhill.

Washington and Lee will counter
with ten returning lettermen from
last year's solid 17-8 club, Captain
Mike Daniel, who passed the 1,000
career point plateau at the close of
last season, will lead the Generals
into tonight's encounter. Coach
Verne Canfield’s squads have posted
five straight winning seasons.

Tip-off time for the varsity game

is 8:30 p.m. The Washington and
Lee freshmen face the Cavayearlings
at 6:00 p.m.

Prior to the game, a brief “tip-off”
ceremony, featuring remarks by
President Robert E. R. Huntley and
visiting dignataries will be con-
ducted.

Phe $3.25 million addition includes
facilities for all of Washington and
Lee’s winter athletic teams, as well
as other additional features, The new
gym currently seats about 2200 fans
and can eventually be expanded to
a capacity of 4000.

Also included in the new building
is a six lane, 75° swimming pool.
Seating capacity for this area is
roughly 250.

A spacious new wrestling practice
room is also a new addition, al-
though most home matches will be
held in the new gym. The wrestling
squad conducted elimination bouts
to pick its starting lineup this after-
noon.

Also housed in the addition are ten
handball and squash courts, a new
weight room which includes a uni-
versal gym, a sauna bath, new team
and locker room space, and offices

winner, and with a little luck, Lex-

plus some very promising freshmen

only one starter from last year's 15

ing is All-American prospect Barry
Parkhill. Coach Bill Gibson's boys
had little trouble out-rebounding the
Generals last year at Charlottesville,
and unless this changes, the Cava-
liers could enjoy another runaway.
Coach Gibson says that he expects
to be running and pressing more this
season, so this one should be an ex-

The Washington and Lee Generals
also return their eleven starters from

from the Canfield philosophy of bas

2 THE RING-TUM PHI

Page

 

 

Tonight is the “inaugural event” for Doremus Gymnasium,
All the folks in the Athletic Department would quickly add
that “inaugural event” is not synonymous with “grand open-
ing.” A great deal of the work is still uncompleted. Nonethe-
less, the New Doremus facilities are partially finished, as evi-
denced by this evening's basketball game against the Univer-
sity of Virginia.

The grandiose expansion of the antiquated Doremus Gym-
nasium into an athletic complex has been costly for Washing-
ton and Lee University. Three million dollars is no meager
sum in this era of tight money. Yet, W&L appropriated
$3,000,000 in addition to its current operating budget in order
to give the school a first-rate basketball court and swimming
pool, Construction of the new wing to Doremus spanned an
approximate two year period. During these months, parking
spaces vanished, roads became muddy ruts, and inconvenience
often abounded. Old Doremus was largely shut down for
renovation. W&L men lacked locker facilities, showers and
dressing rooms. Physical Education participants were told to
take showers in the dormitories.

But the costs of New Doremus in terms of dollars, time and
inconveniences are balanced by undeniable benefits. The in-
tercollegiate athletic teams are the most obvious beneficiaries,
The basketball, swimming and wrestling coaches can finally
show prospective athletes the inside of the gym, It used to be
that high school athletes were rushed by the 1915 structure
with hopes they would not want a closer glimpse. Intramural
athletes are able to calm their athletic frustrations in the vast
labyrinth that is Doremus. In years past IM sports took a
back seat to the varsity sports. There simply was not enough
time or space to let intramural and intercollegiate basketball

more tickets mean more money ; more money means better en

letics, intramurals, the Mock Convention or the Dance Board,
you can take solace, You may just saunter into the red brick
monolith and swim or shoot baskets unhindered by teams or

hundreds of would-be or has-been jocks.

Doremus is almost through, its completion is imminent.
But once the finishing touches have been completed on the $3
million structure, what will come next?

Other physical improvements and construction are crit-
ically required if W&L wishes to remain a superior university.
The list below outlines some of the specific needs of the school.

*\ LIBRARY. The Cyrus Hall McCormick Library is in-
adequate. Even with some of the 235,000 volumes farmed out
to six departmental collections, McCormick is terribly cram-
med full of books, magazines, study areas and classrooms. The
Music and Sociology Departments are housed under the
McCormick roof, due to a lack of space. Washington and Lee
has hired an industrious librarian, Maurice Leach, who has
purchased a considerable number of volumes. But the ques
tion remains unanswered—where can the books go? A new li-
brary, not a library-classroom-studyhall conglomerate is des

perately needed,

*DORMITORIES “The Old Freshman Dormitory is not
conducive to studying, sleeping or even showering at times
W&L requires most entering freshmen to live in this structure.
It is not on par with the dorms at many, many universities in
the nation, Aside from the freshman problem, few upperclass
men can be accommodated in John W. Davis Hall. With an
expanding undergraduate population and a decreasing apart
ment market, the university should try and give more upper
classmen students a place to live. Despite the need for both

With tonight's inauguration of the
new $3.25 million addition to Dore-
mus gymnasium—complete — with
tours, open house, basketball game,
and pre-game “tip-off” ceremony by
President E. R. Huntley and visiting
dignitaries—Old Doremus seems to
fade off into oblivion.

Yet Old Doremus is more than
just the place where, up to now,
W&L students worked out and ath-
letic competitions took place. Some-
how the spirit and tradition of Wash-
ington and Lee and the two men for
which the University was named are
integrated into the concrete, wood,
and steel of its structure.

For Old Doremus sprang, almost
full-blown, from that pervasive spir-
it. It stands as a monument to an
unknown student who was friendly
to a casual visitor, That student plac-
ed his books on the ground and of-
fered to escort the visitor around
campus, identifying the points of in
terest. That visitor happened to be
Robert Parker Doremus of New
York.

Mr. Doremus was so impressed
with the student's action that upon
his return to New York, without
ever speaking with any University
official, he made provision that, upon
the death of his wife, his entire
estate should go to W&L.

In 1913, after Mr. Doremus’ death,
Mrs. Doremus donated, in memory
of her husband, the gymnasium com
plete with pool, at a cost of $100,
000. Former athletic director Cy
Twombly believes it would cost “a
million and a half” to build the same
gym today. At that time, it was the
finest gym in the South. With the
death of Mrs, Doremus, the entire
estate of $1.5 million came to the
University, the largest single gitt in
the history of W&L.,

The story is not just another leg
end, another part of the Washington
and Lee mythology, as some now
believe the Honor System and the
and tie, even the W&L “gen
tleman” are. No, the story has been
verified by Mrs. Doremus’ sister to
Dean Emeritus Gilliam, and stands
as a memorable moment in W&L's
216-year history.

coal

But the magic of Old Doremus
doesn't end with the story of its
aquisition. For many, like Coach

Twombly and Cap'n Dick, former
athletic directors, the gym holds
many memories, memories of an era
of WAL athletic greats and old-time
problems. Just to begin to mention a
few

In 1936, the National Collegiate
Wrestling Championships were held
there. It was the days when Okla-
homa and Oklahoma State were the
wrestling powerhouses. Oklahoma
won that year, but WAL didn't go
out the back door unnoticed. The
Blue put a man in the finals to vie
for honors as a heavyweight. A
good many Southern Conference

Wrestling Championships were held
there throughout the years when
W&L and V.M.I. dominated the
wrestling in the Southern Confer
ence. As Coach Twombly tells it;
“Yeah. We held the final affair a
good many times in the gym. One
year going into the finals, we had
every one of W&L’s wrestling team
going into the finals, except the
heavyweight. And most of them
won.” And the gym served to house
some major prep school tourneys
back in those years, especially South
Carolina and Woodrought, Under its
roof practiced the South’s first box-
ing and wrestling teams—an honor
shared with U.Va.

Coach Twombly remembers also

And the renowned Mock Conven-

what it was like to be athletic direc

that though; it’s just like a real con-

licate. They'd get red ink and cigar-

to give me a fit.” But Old Doremus
withstood it all, took it all in,

Selective Service Revisions Explained

BY CURTIS W. TARR

The agent for progress and im-
provement is participation. The Se-
lective Service System has undergone
many significant changes in the past
two years, Many of the changes are
directly attributable to the young
men and women who participated
responsibly during this difficult per-
iod of change.

Our chief mechanism for this
youth involvement has been the Se-
lective Service Youth Advisory Com-
mittees, Established in every state
across the country, the groups have
discussed the ideas, suggestions and
criticisms of youth on a wide variety
of draft topics.

The new draft law and regula-
tions reflect nearly two dozen signi-
ficant changes in the system, Of the
thirty-six suggestions put forward by
over 600 youth advisers, eighteen
have been implemented by law or
regulation. Six are being studied
further for possible future imple-
mentation. Ten were beyond the
jurisdictional control of the Selec-

 

 

tive Service System and were refer-
red to the Executive Branch or Con-
gress for consideration. Only two
were disapproved.

One of the more important changes
brought about concerned the age of
local draft board members. The
youth committees suggested lower
ages and a curtailment of the length
of service on local boards. Regula-
tions previously stated that citizens
could not be appointed to local
boards unless they were at least 30
years old. They could not serve be-
yond their 75th birthday or for more
than 25 years. The new regulations
and law limit service on local draft
boards to 20 years and set a maxi-
mum age of 65 years. A minimum
age of 18 has been set for appoint-
ment to local boards,

In accord with our youth advisers’
recommendations, the new law abo-
lished student deferments for all col-
lege students who were not enrolled
during the 1970-1971 academic year.
In other words, from now on, no
more college deferments will be

granted. But the law also provides
that both undergraduate and gradu-
ate students who receive induction
orders will have their inductions
postponed until the end of their cur-
rent academic term, quarter, or se-
mester, A student in his last acade-
mic year can have his induction post-
poned until the end of the school
year, allowing him to graduate.

The advisers were concerned that
draft calls varied from community to
community ,and they sought a more
uniform approach to selecting men
for service.

In the past a system based upon
total registration was used to ap-
portion the national draft call to the
state headquarters, who in turn ap-
portioned the call to individual local
draft boards, The new regulations
removed the requirement to use this
system and instead established a uni-
form national call. Now all young
men in the nation with the same lot-
tery numbers who are available will
receive induction notices at nearly
the same time.

It was recommended that young
men be afforded a judicial review of
appeals to local and state boards in
classification matters, The new law
provides a realistic move in this di-
rection, permitting a young man ap-
pealing his classification to bring
witnesses and present his appeal to
a quorum of the board. The young
man also is allowed now to make a
personal appearance before the Sen-
ate and Presidential appeal boards.
Further, a registrant can require a
board to give him a written explana-
tion of its denial of his claim.

Among our advisers were con-
scientious objectors who believed
that they should be provided an op-
portunity to work in jobs that betier
serve the national health, interest
and welfare. Under the old law con-
scientious objectors performing al-
ternate civilian service were under
the control of local draft boards.
Under the new law the National Di-
rector of Selective Service has the

W&L Ends 4-5 Season Beating Washington, 38-6

BY LEWIS HIXSON

The Washington and Lee Generals
ended their season Saturday, Novem-
ber 13 with an impressive victory
over Washington University in St.
Louis. This was the fourth’ win. in
the last five games for the Generals
giving them a 4-5 record on the
season.

The General defense must once
again be commended for an excel-
lent job as it gave up zero points
to the Washington offense and tal-
lied six points of its own. The Blue
offense must also be congratulated as
it more than doubled its opponent in
total yardage. There were many in-
dividual’ heroes for’ the Generals.
Steve Fluharty hit on ten of 14 for
101 yards and a touchdown. Tom
Van Amburgh gained 152 yards on
30 carries and scored three touch-
downs; one coming on a 13 yard
pass play. Chappy Conrad caught
seven passes tO finish the season
with a total of 47 receptions for 573
yards, Jim Farrar picked up 51
yards in only five carries to-average
over ten yards a shot. Marshall
Washburn intercepted a Washington
pass and retutned it 63 yards for a
touchdown. Dave Brooks and Tim
Haley also had a good game on
defense as they ended up the year
with the most tackles. For the
season Brooks totaled 89 tackles
and Haley had 85 tackles to his cred-
it,

Washington University © “scored
first on a fluke play midway into
the initial period. A’ pitchout in-
tended for Van Amburgh was picked
off by Poelker for Washington who
carried it 75 yards for a score. The
conversion was unsuccessful ~ and
Washington held an carly lead, 6-0.

Neither team: was able te get into
the end zone again before half.

In the third quarter W&L got a
break when Scott Neese fell on a
fumble at the Washington 40. Flu-
harty then drove the Blue offense
downfield mixing passes with runs by
Van Amburgh to gain needed yard-
age. Van Amburgh finally got the
tally with a plange over right tackle.
The point after was good by Chase
and at the end of the third quarter
the score had the Generals up by a
single point 7-6.

In the fourth quarter everything
broke loose, as far as the Generals
were concerned, as they scored 31
points by capitalizing on mistakes
by Washington. Doug Chase led off
things by kicking a 31 yard field
goal with 9:32 left in the game. The
next score came on a ten yard pass
from Fluharty to Conrad, That
made it W&L 17, Washington 6
with 6:16 remaining in the quarter.

WAL kicked off to Washington
who held it for six plays before
Washburn picked off a pass at the
W&L 37 and returned it all the way
for a touchdown. The ‘point ‘after
put the Blue ahead 24-6,

It took Washington only one play
to give up the ball at their own 29,
as Jon Markley fell on a loose ball
for the Blue. Then, it only seemed
fitting, that the Generals would take
one play to score. Van Amburgh
seampered around:end for the 29
yards needed to put the game out of
reach. The conversion was true once
again and with only 2:29 left on the
clock; thé Blue team led, 31-6. It
had taken the Blue only 18 seconds
to score two touchdowns. The Gen-
crats managed to score once more in
the last play of the game on a 13

yard pass from David Otey to Van
Amburgh. The final score read:
W&L 38—Washington 6.

Washington and Lee University’s
turnaround. football. season should
serve notice on next year’s oppon-
ents: the Generals will be tough in
1972.

Coach Buck Leslie’s team lost the
first four games of a very tough
schedule, but then jelled to win four
of the last five, including impressive
victories over Coast Guard and
Washington University of St. Louis.

Most of the team returns for next
year. Only nine of the 62-member
squad are seniors,

The Generals capped off the turn-
around’ season with last. Saturday's
38-6 victory over Washington, rally-
ing from a 6-0 halftime deficit. The
score was still only 7-6 after three
quarters, the Generals exploding for
31 points in the fourth quarter.

“| think the turning point of the
season was the Bucknell game,” said
Coach Leslie. Although the Generals
lost, 27-0,-they moved the ball well
against the much bigger Bisons, par-
ticularly in the second half.

“The team felt they could play
in a tougher league,” Leslie explain-
ed. “The first victory followed the
next week against Western Mary-

land, and from there it was a matter
of momentum.”

The season’s statistics bear out the
reversal, By season’s end, the Gen-
erals had held their own or out-
gained the opponents in all cate-
gories, including scoring. Surpris-
ingly, thanks to the last two games,
W&L gained more yardage on the
ground than in the air.

The ground-gaining was shared
about equally among four runners:
senior JoJo Martin compiling 315,
soph Jim Farrer 305, junior Tommy
Van Amburgh 248 and junior Lat
Purser 236,

Meanwhile, the passing game, pac-

ed by junior quarterback Steve Flu-
harty and junior receiver Chappy
Conrad, was equally as impressive.
Fluharty completed 74 of 170 passes
for 940 yards and seven touchdowns.
Conrad caught most of them, 47,
for 573 yards and four scores,

Ihe kicking game also played an
important part, Conrad consistently
got off long, booming punts, averag-
ing over 40 yards a kick. Sophomore
placement specialist Doug Chase was
perfect on extra points, 18 for 18,
and hit three of five field goals to
end up the leading scorer,

All of the above players, except

W&L Opens With U.Va;
' Tournament Comes Next

Although Washington and Lee
might have a slight home court ad-
vantage in tonight’s game, Bill Gib-
son’s team from the University of
Virginia has to be favored, The pre-
season word from Charlottesville is
that the Cavaliers will be even bet-
ter than last year when the Wahoos
fashioned a 15-11 record, their first
winning season in 17 years,

Included was a 92-70 breeze past
WAL in University Hall, a game in
which talented sophomore guard
Barry Parkhill (they call him “Mr.
B.P.”) killed the Generals early with
his scoring and steals, Already draft-
ed by the pros, the rangy, 6-4 play-
maker is back to do his thing out
front, and that merely entails shoot-
ing a basketball perhaps better than
any guard in the country. It’s a sure
thing he'll be the best player to hit
Lexington this season.

With big, 6-10 Scott McCandlish
lurking underneath, the Wahoos are
a balanced outfit, with plenty of ex-
perience to go around, Besides Park-
hill and McCandlish, two other start-
ers from last year’s team return
guard Tim Rash and forward Frank
DeWitt—and they are joined by a
newcomer, 6-7 sophomore forward
Bob McCurdy, who averaged 24.9
points a game with the Baby Cava-
liers last winter, Other top talent
comes from Jim Hobgood, Bob Me-
Keag, Lanny Stahurski, and Lexing-
ton’s Chip “Litthe Weenie” Miller,
son of a former W&L_ basketball
coach, L. F. “Weenie” Miller.

The Generals will counter with an
experienved (10 lettermen) team that
features considerable balance and
depth. although short on height. Sen
ior forward Mike Daniel, the W&l
capta'n, had a 19.1 scoring average
last year aud looked impressive in a
recent workout against VMI. He's an
aggressive sort who doesn’t mind
driv'ng against taller men, a char-
acteristic that will be put to a severe
test here tonight, Daniel will have to
be in top form if W&L hopes t>
eve Virginia a good game.

At 6-8, junior center Paul Me
Clure has the potential to neutralize
McCandlish. McClure did it often in
last year’s game, and this particular
match-up will be important to the
Generals this evening. McClure was
a vital ingredient in W&L’s 17-8
record last year, the Generals’ fifth
straight big winning season, albeit
against competition not quite on the
same level as the ACC-member
Wahoos,

Besides Daniel and McClure, the
lettermen include seniors John
Glace, Ellis Gutshall, and Dave
Stone; juniors Hatton Smith, Doug

SPORTS
FHORTS
SHORT:

Coach Buck Leslie revealed the
bizarre circumstances of WAL’s last
play touchdown against Washington
University. Leslie told the officials
that only the quarterback could call
timeouts. With only seconds left and
the Generals way ahead, David Otey
went into the game for the Blue, He

asked how much time was left and
the officials thought amid the con

(Continued on page 6)

Clelan, Charlie Strain, and John
Dumas; and sophomore Skip Licht-
fuss, The only newcomer is senior
guard Scott Wood, a likely starter
who returns after a year’s absence.

If anything is going to be changed
this year, Verne Canfield says it’s
going to be the way his team con-
ducts itself on the floor, not in be-
havior but in style of play. Once
known as a ball control club, with
an emphasis on defense, please, the
new Generals are going to open it
up with fast breaks (remember those)
and a gung-ho offense with points
in mind,

With that considered, and appreci-
ating the fact that Virginia has a
pretty fair running attack of its own,
then fans at tonight’s game should
get their money’s worth, One thing
is certain. Things should be loud,
what with these two teams getting
together in Lexington, The last time
Virginia tried playing W&L here,
the Wahoos were lucky not to have
been tarred-and-feathered, so ada-
ment was the crowd to see their de-
mise, Which it helped along, 78-68.

W&L Tournament

Host Washington and Lee will
play Lycoming, and Drexel will op-
pose West Virginia Tech, in the first
round of the W&L Invitational Bas-
ketball Tournament Friday night.

“aa

ship game.

All four teams appear about even,

for the tournament. W&L and Ly-

coming have met just once before,’

in the opening round of the 1967
Randolph-Macon Tournament, with
Lycoming winning, 78-70. The Gen-
erals recently split a pair of games
with West Virginia. Tech, winning
47-36 at W&L three years ago and
losing, 85-70, at Tech two years ago.
The Generals and Drexel have never
met,

W&L will be led by 6-3 senior
forward Mike Daniel, the team cap-
tain who averaged 19.1 points a
game last year and ranks sixth on
the all-time. W&L career scoring
list with 1,034 points.

West Virginia Tech, in a rebuild-
ing year, is paced by 6-3 John Gour-
ley, who averaged 18.2 points a
game last year. Lycoming has a raft
of sophomores, the best of them 6-4
Rich Henninger, who scored 503
points last year as a freshman.
Drexel is paced by 5-10 guard Jerry
Glick, who averaged 14.1 points a
game last year, and 6-4 forward

Vince Morrison, who averaged 12.1.

 

Eid

WAL's top returnce is senior Mike Daniel who averaged 19.1 points
last season. Standing 6-3 Daniel was the second leading rebounder with

an 8.6 mark.

Old Doremus its magic, some will
see this article as a last memorial to
Old Doremus, But | would hope not.
Creditable as it may seem, I have no
desire to have written Old Doremus’
eulogy. No, Old Doremus must live
on, held up by its heritage and sym-
bolizing what W&L was, is, and
must remain. And | would hope,
that the new addition, although not
yet formally dedicated, will with to-
night’s game begin to assimilate
through the activities to be held in
it the same spirit and tradition that
now lives in Old Doremus, And that
years from now, the new addition
will be so steeped in that heritage
that “New” and “Old” Doremus will
merge into one, simply Doremus.
Doremus gymnasium, conceived by
two great traditions, living on in that
heritage, and safe in General Lee's
one rule,

Armstrong, and Rolf Piranian, W&L
has never placed as many men on
the All-Star roster before. After a
series of losses early in the season,
the soccer team won four out of
their last six contests to finish 5-6.

Baseball practice commences in
January. Pitchers are the most prec-
iously needed commodity according
to Coach Joe Lyles, The batting cage
ought to be in action very soon, If
any freshmen are interested in play-
ing baseball, Lyles encourages them

New Boxwoods

By PAUL LANCASTER

“The gift enabled us to get bushes
we otherwise could not have dream-
ed of having...” This was the
consensus of Mr, Farris Hotchkiss,
Director of University Development,
on the recent addition of 36 English
Boxwood shrubs to the W&L
campus,

Mr. Hotchkiss said that the shrub-
bery was a gift of Wilmer S. Poynor,
of Birmingham, Alabama, whose
son, John, was a 1962 graduate of
the University, Hotchkiss noted that
“18 months ago, Poynor found
these specimen bushes in Wytheville,
Virginia,” and, in gratitude to the
University, he donated them,

Hotchkiss cited the value of the
English Boxwoods, “They cost up

Hotchkiss could not praise the
valuable donation enough. “In these
(the boxwoods), Poynor has given
us a gift that is unusual in subject

. it has benefited the university
in an extremely valuable way.”

He emphasized the value of these
particular English Boxwoods in rela-
tion to other species. “The English
Boxwood grows much more slowly
than the American variety, and it
is therefore much more valuable.”
Hotchkiss also cited the size of the
bushes as another major factor in
the worth of the shrubs,

As for the total cost of the
project to the University, W&L paid
for the transportation of the bushes
from Wytheville and the installation
of the bushes. This cost, Hotchkiss
noted, was minimal with respect to
the overall value of the gift.

Draft System Undergoing

Significant Changes

(Continued from Page 3)
mum age requirements of the law.
While the draft system will suffer
from the loss of these dedicated men
and women, we are eager to take
advantage of this opportunity to re-
place them with young men and
women reflecting the ethnic, educa-
tional and social backgrounds of reg-
istrants across the nation,

Appointed by the President upon
the recommendation of the state
governor, the local board member
holds, perhaps, the most important
position in the Selective Service Sys-
tem. A young man or woman who
might be interested in serving on a
local board or in assuming other
volunteer positions in the Selective
Service System should contact the
office of his or her governor.

Many young people are asking
themselves these days with a greater
degree of seriousness than was dis-
played by previous generations
where their values lay, what activi-
ties make their lives meaningful, and
how they can better contribute to
society. | hope that many young
men and women will recognize these
new opportunities to serve in the Se-
lective Service as a worthwhile
means of social involvement and
public service, We need their help.

Those familiar with Jean Cocteau
can witness his first venture into the
medium of film as a form of expres-
sion, “The Blood of the Poet.” The
well-known work will be presented
by the WAL Film Committee free of
charge to students and faculty at
8:30 p.m. next Wednesday.

Wood. Behind or in front of these
three are Dave Stone, Hatton Smith,
and Charlie Strain, With some luck,
the team will get more scoring sup-
port from this year’s backcourt.

In an interview before the holi-
days, Coach Canfield seemed very
pleased with his defense, insisting
that it was already better than it was
at the end of last season. The ball-
players are scrapping more. When a
loose balls on the floor, they are
usually on it, Coach Canfield also
seemed pleased with the remarkable
experience of his squad. This could
be a crucial factor in some of the
closer games.

academic year at 91.5 (FM), Student
broadcasters are entirely responsible

dents at the university provide it
with the area's only locally gathered

The Generals will be a more ex-
citing team this year. Their schedule
is a rough one, including such as
Lehigh, Navy, and tonight's big en-
counter.

This weekend marks the first
Washington and Lee Invitational
Tournament. The three other teams
will come from Drexel, Lycoming,
and West Virginia Tech. The games
will be on Friday and Saturday.

Our encounter with the Cavaliers
should be an interesting one. One
has to pick the Cavaliers, but don't
sell W&L short. Whatever the out-
come, it should prove to be an in-
teresting and exciting ball game.
Come out and see all the stars.

that’s a pleasant thought for the

winter.
