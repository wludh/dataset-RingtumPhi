WAL students must prove they
are residents of the district in which
they attend school in order to meet
the requirements of voter registra-
tion in that area. As reported in the
News-Gazette, Virginia Attorney
General Andrew P. Miller delivered
his opinion to Mrs. Gerald S. Ma-
han, president of the State electoral
board, in a letter dated in late July.

The question of whether or not a
college student may vote in his cam-
pus community has become a hot
political issue ever since a court-
ordered ban on California residency
requirements resulted in a radical
majority in Berkeley's city govern-
ment, Since 18-year-olds may now
vote with the June ratification of the
twenty-sixth amendment, similar reg-
istration drives, as took place in
Berkeley, could produce a similar
effect in other college towns with
swollen student rolls, such as Am-
herst. Massachusetts, Gainesville,
Florida, or Princeton, New Jersey.

Locally, students in both Lexing-
tion and Charlottesville have com-
plained that, if taxed by their cam-
pus community, they deserve some
voice in the determination of local
political administration, State laws
on the matter vary widely, accord-
ing to the Richmond News Leader,
whose survey has found that 11
states under no condition allow col-
lege students to participate in town
elections, that 12 states require
proof of financial independence be-
fore registration; and that 11 other
states offer various conditions as ob-
stacles to student voting

According to the News-Gazette,
“the Attorney General's letter placed
the burden of proof of residency on

the student requesting registration
Local registrars, however, must pass

both domicile and abode, and the
difficulty is in determining domicile.

He said that the Virginia Supreme
Court has held that establishment of
new domicility includes physical or
bodily presence in the new locality,
an intent to abandon the old domi-
cile, and a concurrent intent to adopt
another domicile in the new location.

“The first requisite is clearly met
when a student enters a given juris-
diction to attend an institution of
learning,” Mr. Miller stated, “but as
to the second and third requisites,
the registrar must ascertain the in-
tent of the student and manifested

in his words and actions.”

Thus, more than the mere fact of
attending W&L and living in Lex-
ington or Rockbridge County is nec-
essary to indicate a legal domicile. A
student must show an intention to
make the city or county a perman-
ent home in order to register in the
respective area. For instance, the 12
month rental of an apartment in
Lexington does not, in itself, satisfy
the requirements, stated Mrs. Eva
Moore, the general registrar for the
City of Lexington.

mining the validity of residency

72 Convention Scheduled

In Doremus

Planning has been under way this
summer to prepare for the 1972
Mock political Convention, which
will be the 15th version of one of
WA&L's most famous traditions. In
the advance enactments of the out
of-power party's Presidential nomi
nating procedure, the students have
been correct all but four times since
1908 in predicting the outcome.

Next May's activities will com
mence with the traditional gala par-
ade through the streets of Lexing
ton to the “convention center.”
Doremus Gymnasium. Nationally
known politicians will be in attend
ance,

The convention is not a reflection
of the student delegates’ own preter
ences, but rather a sober attempt to
foresee exactly what the actual party
delegates will do. Any WAL stu-
dent may assume a delegate’s roic
and each state's chairman will be
committed to directing research into
the way his real counterpart will act
during this summer's Democratic
Convention in Miami Beach

During the fall semester most of
the work will focus on the logistical
problems of hook-up telephone line:
with actual state delegations, with
setting up platforms, and with ac
quiring the basic financing for the
project. This effort will be directed
by the co-chairmen of the 1972
Mock Convention; Mike Campilon

Fairfax County, Virginia, and Tom

Faculty Additions And

Promotions Announced

Eleven new appointments were
made to the faculty during the sum-
mer months, in addition to promo-
tions announced for nine professors
already members of the W&L fac-
ulty, Nine of the new members will
teach in the College of Arts and Sci-
ences; one, in the School of Com-
merce, Economics, and Politics; and
one more, in the School of Law.

Named to be full professors were
James Boatwright of the English de-
partment, editor of W&L’s literary
journal, “Shenandoah,” and also Dr.
Gerard M. Doyon, head of the art
department.

Promoted from assistant professor
to associate professor were Charles
B. Brockman of romance languages,
Drs. David Gordon Elmes of psy-
chology and Frederic L. Schwab of
the geology department, and Joseph
E. Ulrich of the law school.

Newly promoted assistant profes-
sors are Dr, Harold C. Hill of the

German department, [-Hsiung Ju,
artist-in-residence and art faculty
member, and William J. Stearns,

swimming coach and assistant track
coach in the physical education de-
partment.

Returning to W&L in the College
division will be Dr. Leonard E. Jar-
rard as professor of psychology.
Formerly chairman of the graduate
psychology program at Carnegie-
Mellon University, Dr. Gerrard has
received a grant from the National
Science Foundation of $20,000 to

claims is a personal statement by
the applicant that he intends to re-
main in Lexington for an indefinite
period. This intention may be sub-
stantiated by indicating that one pays
local automobile taxes, has a job in
the area, or has made a declaration
of personal property to the com-
missioner of revenue. However, the
intent of the student is the crucial
factor.

The News-Gazette also reported
that Mrs. Dan Tetlow, the former
general registrar for Lexington,
thought that some students “Have
falsely claimed an intention to re
main in Lexington after graduation.”

Saturday, October 2, is the last
day one can register for the Novem-
ber general elections.

:

support new research into motiva-
tion and behavior.

Dr. Jarrard taught at W&L from
1959, when he received the Ph.D.
degree from Carnegie-Mellon, until
1966. Under his direction, the W&L
project will focus on the relationship
between the hippocampus—a_ seg-
ment of the brain—and motivational
actions, for instance; hunger, thirst,
and exploratory activity. Dr. Jar-
rard will assume head of the depart-
ment in 1972, when Dr. William H.
Hinton, the current chairman,
reaches the mandatory retirement
age for department heads,

Other appointments: Named as-
sistant professor of biology was Dr.
Faith Harriet Gray, formerly a re-
search associate at Ohio State Uni-
versity. A 1968 Ph.D. graduate of
Ohio State, Dr. Gray has taught
part-time at Mount Holyoke and
Ohio State in addition to her re-
search activity, and from 1968 until
1970 held a post-doctoral appoint-
ment at the University of Miami
(Florida).

Dr. Charles W. Hickox, who re-
ceived the Ph.D. degree in geology
from Rice University last spring,
will join the faculty for one year as
assistant professor of geology, re-
placing Dr. Frederic Schwab, who is
spending this year in the British
Isles under a National Science
Foundation grant. Dr. Hickox was a
teaching assistant at Middlebury
College, the University of Arkansas,
and Rice.

Named instructors in the College
were Edward D. Craun and Phillip
M. Keith, both in the English De-
partment; Scott B. Cummings, socio-
logy; J. David Lazor, geology, Barry
F. Machado, history, and William
L. Sessions, philosophy.

Craun, a B.A. graduate of Wheat-
on College, is a Ph.D. candidate in
English at Princeton. Keith is for-
merly an instructor in English at
Swarthmore College, and holds the
A.B. degree from Amherst College
and the M.A, from Bryn Mawr.

B.A. graduate of the University of
Maine and earned his M.A. degree
from San Jose State College.

Lazor, a graduate of Wooster Col-
lege and Indiana University, will re-
place Dr. Edgar Spencer, head of
the geology department, who will be
on leave this year under a Sloan
grant.

History instructor Machado ex-
pects to receive his Ph.D. from
Northwestern University, where he
received the M.A. in 1969. He also
holds a B. A. degree from Dart-
mouth,

Sessions will hold a one-year ap-
pointment at W&L while Dr. Har-
rison J. Pemberton, head of the
philosophy department, is on leave
under a Ford Foundation grant. Ses-
sions is a Ph.D. candidate at Yale,
and holds the B.A. from the Univer-
sity of Colorado and the M.A, from
Union Theological Seminary.

Dean Atwood announced that
James S. Wafler, a Ph.D. candidate
at the University of Minnesota, will
join the W&L faculty for one year
as instructor, replacing Dr. William
Buchanan, head of the department,
who will be on leave in Ireland un-
der a National Science Foundation
grant. Wafler received his B.A. de-
gree cum laude from St. Olaf Col-
lege and the M.A, from Minnesota.
For the past year he has held a
management internship with the En-
vironmental Science Services Ad-
ministration and has taught at Minn-
esota and at the National Science
Foundation’s quantitative methods
institute for political scientists.

In the School of Law Dean Stein-
heimer announced the appointment
of James Bond, formerly at the Uni-
versity of Virginia, to be assistant
professor of law. Bond is a B.A.
graduate of Wabash College and
received the LL.B. degree from Har-
vard University and the LL.M. at
Virginia. He has served as instructor
in the international and comparative
law division of the Judge Advocate
General's School in Charlottesville
and has worked on an Army-wide
project to rewrite the law of war.

brought limited co-education to
Washington and Lee. This year a
total of 23 women from other Vir-
ginia colleges, will attend the Uni-
versity, including 15 from Hollins,
2 from Sweet Briar, 5 from Mary
Baldwin, and | from Randolph Ma-
con Woman's College.

The opportunities the program of-
fers to Washington and Lee students
to study at one of the other seven
colleges (Davidson, Hampden-Syd-
ney, Hollins, Mary Baldwin, Ran-
dolph-Macon, Randolph-Macon Wo-
man's and Sweet Briar) have been
for the most part overlooked. Ap-
plications are now being accepted
for next year’s program, and the
first deadline for application is Octo-
ber 10. The program is designed for
juniors who wish to broaden the
scope of their educational experience
and take advantage of course offer-
ings, special programs, and lines of
study not available at Washington
and Lee

According to Dean William J.
Watt, who co-ordinates the program
at Washington and Lee, the two-fold
increase of exchange students on
campus was not a universal experi
ence among the colleges involved in
the program. Also, while some
courses—notably Journalism—which
are unavailable at the other schools
have been particular atiractions, the
exchange students are enrolled in a
wide variety of courses in both un
dergraduate divisions of the Uni
This indicates that the
change in academic environment of
fered by the program is also a signi
fieant factor in the decision to ex
change. Although 23 women will
participate in the program at WAl
this vear, some of these will attend
for only one term

|OUTLOOKandREview| Road Changed :

September has returned to Lexington and (select one)
a. unavoidably
b. unfortunately
c. big deal
d. sadly
e. all of the above
with this issue in your hands the Ring-tum Phi has likewise
reappeared on the Washington and Lee University scene.

Hopefully, you will continue to be an ardent subscriber and
reader long after September has passed. As a brief enticement
to you ladies and gentlemen who are stil unconvinced, here
is a synopsis of what to anticipate. With the aid of an eager
staff the spectrum of life in lovely Lexington will be un-
folded right before your eyes. Our joint effort will be to in-
form you, entertain you, motivate you, humor you and maybe
irritate you.

Another object this year will be to tell you not only what is
transpiring on “the Hill” but beyond. Simultaneously, our
staff will strive to inform you why things are happening here
and perhaps more significantly, why not.

Your academic year 1971-1972 will span a series of exciting

goings-on. More specifically, we refer to: the opening of ex- ,

panded Doremus Gymnasium (not to overlook the U.Va.
basketball game or the NCAA small college swimming cham-
pionships), the Mock Convention, Contact '72, rush, the ap-
pearance of over 20 somewhat shapely coeds, and possible the
reincarnation of the Fancy Dress Ball.

That ought to be a sufficient introduction and forewarning.
Turning to more vital matters, each of you is surely eager to
learn what has been taking place in Lexington duling your
summer vacations, The answer shall be brief since, as you
might expect, very little has changed. In the short amount of
space left in this 4x12 inche column of type we will attempt to
capsulize the traumatic events of the summer.

Most obvious of all the driveway in front of the Freshman
Dormitories is no more. Yet wait, it has only been remodeled
along with the parking lots nearby. Consequently, the 180 de-
gree hairpin turn on Washington Street has been removed.
Another proud W&L tradition bites the dust.

Probably, the largest gathering of W&L men during the
summer occurred at Indiantown Gap Military Reservation.
You may wonder what the occasion was? Junior ROTC cadets
were attending summer camp. The whole thing was worthy of
visitations by Deans Wiliam Schildt and Lewis John, and
not much else.

The Co-op remained the nerve center of the campus
throughout the summer months despite its abbreviated hours
of operation. Sadly, prices suffered a considerable boost. The
only nickel cup of coffee, served exclusively in our Co-op,
jumped to the all time high price of a dime. Even President
Nixon's wage-price freeze cannot save the death of one of
Washington and Lee’s finest traditions.

Lee Chapel was painted. Undoubtedly, that is a tradition
that has been a long time in appearing.

“Virginia is for lovers” buttons popped out across the
campus. Supposedly, Bob Keefe acquired a large cache and dis-
tributed the buttons to staff, faculty and students alike. That
could be the genesis of an outstanding new tradition.

You are certainly up to date by now, It must seem apparent
that not a great deal occurred during your absence. We hope
that the next year will be more eventful and notable. None-
theless, the “Phi” will be there every Wednesday, so why
not read it? Even if you do not savor what it says, it serves
nicely as a fishwrapper. Amen. j.W.R.

The maze of concrete, mud, and
new pavement at the entrance to
the campus between Doremus Gym-
nasium and the old Freshman Dor-
mitory is the beginning of a major
re-designing of Washington and
Lee’s road and parking system,

The first phase, being undertaken
at a cost of more than $100,000 is
scheduled for completion in Octo-
ber.

A new entrance road alongside
the new Doremus Gymnasium addi-
tion, running between Washington
Street and the existing roadway be-
hind McCormick Library has been
completed just in time for the influx
of students. The old entrance road
required cars travelling east on
Washington Street to make almost a
180-degree turn to enter the campus,
but it has been eliminated alto-
gether.

ed for the second phase of the pro-
ject which will be undertaken some-
time after the new gym addition is
completed, and will be finished next
summer, Included in this phase is a
complete revision of the parking and
roadway scheme on the southern
part of the rear campus. New walk-
ways will also be incorporated in
the plan, leading from the parking
lots below and to the west of Dore-
mus Gym. Parking will be eliminat-
ed in the triangular area in front of
the gym, replaced by a series of
walkways.

Overall the project is intended to
enhance the beauty of the part of
the campus most often used, by
creating a park-like atmosphere,

while at the same time making ac-
cess less difficult from Washington
Street. A long range goal is to elimi-
nate the intrusion of as many ve-
hicles as possible into the middle of
the campus.

Freshman Class

Washington and Lee welcomed
the class of 1975 last Tuesday with
a barrage of placement tests, con-
ferences, and speeches. The 353 man
class is smaller than last year’s rec-
ord total of 383. The freshmen are
drawn from 36 states and one for-
eign country, with Virginia, Texas,
and Pennsylvania claiming the larg-
est representation.

Also arriving in scenic Lexington
were 23 girls from Hollins, Sweet
Briar, Mary Baldwin and Randolph-
Macon Womans College. They will
attend W&L as exchange students
under a program begun a year ago.

Letters To The Editor

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

As a freshman, | felt as if I had
been pushed into going to school.
Washington and Lee University was
my choice, whether or not I would
go to college was not. | went with-
out question. This can create a prob-
lem when one attends college for
awhile only to realize after a cer-
tain length of time that he is at-
tending with no conception of a pur-
pose.

I believe that if | had some defin-
ite reason for attending college plac-
ed before my mind, | might have un-
derstood this university sooner, thus
taking advantage of the preliminary
months of my freshman year. I
imagine there are some if not many
freshman and some upperclassmen
whose thoughts revolve around the
questions: Why am I here? What is
the purpose of the university?

In the hope this will be of indi-
vidual benefit to others, | would like
to put forth the suggestions of others
which might be of help in answering
these very basic questions.

As a start, | would like to print
the bulk of a letter written by Rob-
ert E. Lee on January 17, 1867 for
the benefit of parents who need “to
consider the fundamental principles
to be observed in the education of
their children.”

“In its broad, comprehensive sense
education embraces the physical,
moral and intellectual instruction of
a child from infancy to manhood.
Any sysiem is imperfect which does

 

not combine them all and that is
best which while it thoroughly deve-
lops them, abuses the coarse animal
emotions of human nature and
exalts the higher faculties and feel-
ings. A child has everything to learn
and is more readily taught by having
before it good examples to imitate
than by simple precepts. He should
therefore as far as circumstances
will permit, be encouraged to associ-
ate with his parents, for heart must
be affected, his feelings moved as
well as his mind expanded. He may
be taught that it is criminal to steal
and sinful to lie, yet be unable to
apply this knowledge to the govern-
ment of himself and it will therefore
be of no value to him unless the
principle is confirmed into a habit.
Obedience is the first requisite in
family training. It should be made
sincere and perfect and to proceed
as much from affection as a convic-
tion of its necessity. To accomplish
this great prudence and the exercise
of much patience are necessary. By
firmness mixed with kindness, ihe
child by repeated experience will
learn that he is not to follow his
first impulse and that self control,
which even an infant can understand
is necessary to his comfort, Neither
violence or harshness should ever
be used and the parent must bear
constantly in mind that to govern his
child he must show him that he can
control himself. One of the most
common errors in the management
of children is irregularity of behav-

= ; *

 

ior towards them. They are as skill-
ful as pertinacious in their attempts
to gratify their self will; at one time
trying to evade authority, at another
to oppose it. If they once succeed
they are encouraged to perseverse
and it is necessary for the parent to
meet the first attempt with firmness
and not permit himself to be baffled
either by evasion or resistance. Al-
though a child may not yield to
threats and may defy punishment he

Profile Given

Although it is still early to judge
the new arrivals—both male and fe-
male—their academic statistics show
them to compare favorably with
previous classes, said an Administra-
tion spokesman. Almost 200 of
them graduated in the top one-fifth
of their senior class, so they should
be prepared for the rigors of cam
pus life.

Long-time observers of the fresh-
man scene have grimly noted that
this class has followed the current
dress trend, and all but abandoned
the coat-and-tie tradition. Even the
early fraternity rush functions, once
a hot-bed of traditional dress, saw
the freshmen wearing everything
from tank shirts to jungle fatigues.

This does not infer that the class
of ‘75 contains the seeds of anarchy.
Rather, that they are following a
national trend away from such ma-
terial manifestations. Dean William
Schildt, chief coordinator for the
freshmen noted that this class con
tained a “wide diversity of interests
and talents,” with a “higher profile
of independence and individualism.

Mothers, do not despair. General
Lee's college still has more tradition
behind it than the Daughters of the
Confederacy. While _ their
might not match Brooks Brothers
standards, their inquisitive nature
has already made a positive impres-
sion on campus.

Upsets; Frisco; Worster

BY BOB “LASH” LARUE

Some reflections while wondering
what kind of season Washington and
Lee’s football team will have... .
it's looking to be that kind of
screwy year that one runs into every
once in a while. Southern Cal and
LSU, highly regarded favorites
among sports writers, both bit the
dust over the weekend .... The
Trojans, ranked by Sports Hlustrat-
ed as the nation’s third best grid
team, was the first 1971 victim of
that magazine’s infamous “jinx”,
falling prey to Alabama 17-10....
And speaking of topsy-turvy, who
would have thought that San Fran-
cisco would stay out front so long?
Granted the Giants aren't in the
playoffs yet, but then, few felt the
team would make it any higher than
second with a strong wind... . I
still like Frisco’s chance as the West-
ern Division winners, although Pitts-
burgh’s fantastic Pirates will be the
National League’s representative for
1971's October Classic. . . . Former
University of Texas star Steve Wor-
ster’s run-in with Canadian authori-
ties added some substance to the
widely held rumor that something
grassy was going on last New Year's

Rebuilding Gridders
Face Tough Schedule

BY LEWIS HIXSON AND
PALMER TRICE

When students begin their annual
trek out to Wilson Field to watch
the first home football game, there
will be no surprises. “We will be
underdogs in every game,” Head
Coach Buck Leslie emphasized in a
preseason interview.

Coming off a dismal 2-7 season,
the Generals are once again facing
“a rebuilding year.” Last year the
Generals fashioned an exciting pass-
ing attack. It featured sophomore
Steve Fluharty at the helm, throw-
ing to Bruce Green and Steve Ma-
haffey. Steve Mahaffey ended up
leading the country in receptions
yast year, grabbing 74 catches for
897 yards. With their (Green and
Mahaffey) departure, the coaching
staff has two key question marks to
answer, Passing was the gridders’
game plan last year, and this year it

will probably be a replay. To fill the
gaps, Coach Leslie is turning to a
new group of receivers. Fighting for
the flanker spot are Mark Lane, Bob
Hessler, and Rich Romanelli. Chap-
py Conrad and Bill Baldwin have
looked good at the end spots. These
guys could be the key to the W&L
season.

“Three yards and a cloud of dust”
will not be the cry bursting from
Wilson Field, Instead of the “Seven
Blocks of Granite”, the Blue offen-
sive line will take a different tack.
This is, to a large part, due to the
offensive line, which will average
about 185 pounds. The Generals
will rely on a moving pocket, simi-
lar to that used by Len Dawson and
the Kansas City Chiefs. When mov-
ing on the ground, the interior line-
man will depend on the use of traps
and slant blocking.

when Notre Dame crushed Texas in
the Cotton Bowl. . . . Worster con-
tributed nicely to the Irish cause
with several fumbles. . . . Whatever
side of the fence one takes, the in-
cident saddened more than a few.
... If I had three wishes to make
for this baseball season, I would
hope that Vida Blue would win
thirty games, that Willie Stargell hit
fifty home runs, and that the two
could meet up in the World Series.
. . . Wishes one and two look dis-
tant, but the third is a distinct pos-
sibility. . . . For those of you who
have been asking where soccer and
baseball coach Joe Lyles is, word
has it that he has been involved in
the Miss America pageant. .. .
While everyone agrees that the new
addition to Doremus Gym is super-
spectacular, a number of people,
myself included, are wondering what
are the chances for repair on the
locker room showers beneath the
stadium. . . . As any, football, base-

 

ball, lacrosse, or track man_ will
testify, the facilities are pretty poor;
nozzles spit only a tiny spray and
drains back up, creating a horrible
mess. The situation is embarrassing
when other schools use the showers,

with Notre Dame and Nebraska as
this year’s Number One college
team. Make my choice Notre Dame;
somebody from the Big Eight will
knockoff the Cornhuskers . . . and

pened to Tom Dimitroff?

AD Bill McHenry Ponders Gym, CAC

QUESTION: What are some of
your reasons and feelings about
coming back as athletic director
after having played here as an ath-
lete?

McHENRY: Well, I can tell you
this it is a great thrill to be return-
ing to W&L. I had four very happy
years here in the early 1950's under
a different type of program and I
enjoyed my association with Wash-
ington and Lee, I have tried to keep
my friendships over the years with
the people that | knew here but of
course as you get away from a
school you make new friends and
new associations. It has been a great
thrill to come back and the recep-
tion that we have had has just been
tremendous, | am _ really looking
forward to many happy years in
Lexington and at W&L.

QUESTION: We would like you
to comment on scheduling, especi-
ally since our football team plays
such powers as Bucknell and Coast
Guard this season, both of which
appear out of our league.

McHENRY: Well number one,
the scheduling was done before |
came here. Football scheduling is
done 4 or 5 years in advance, | will
be handling the football scheduling
in the future along with our football
coach Buck Leslie and I will cer-
tainly follow any recommendation
that he makes. | agree Bucknell may
be out of our class, but I do not feel
Coast Guard is out of our class.
When I was at Lebanon Valley for
the past two years, we played Coast
Guard, As a matter of fact W&L
fills our spot. We beat them 21-7
two years ago and last year we
lost 27-21. Two real fine games, and
I certainly feel that W&L will have
an excellent chance in this ball
game and | don’t think they are out
of our class at all.

Bucknell is a different story. They
are big time in football, relatively
speaking. It is a fine school, and of
course the type of school you would
like to be associated with, but not
compatible with our football pro-
gram. | am sure our kids will do a
real fine job and I think in general

our football schedule is a very chal-
lenging one this year. But I think
from what I have been able to ob-
serve so far, with the outstanding
spirit and attitude that the kids have
shown I am confident that they are
going to be in there in every ball
game. I have the greatest confidence
in the program that we are running
here. As far as our scheduling is
concerned, we don’t have conference
scheduling to be concerned with.

eee

 

Each individual coach handles his
own scheduling with my approval. I
have asked the coaches to do this
immediately following the season. |
want to be involved with the sche-
duling, yet | want the coaches to
have the right to pick and choose
the teams that they want to play
wherever possible.

QUESTION: What kind of tour-
naments, CAC tournaments, cham-
pionships or any other kind of
sporting events are to be held in
the new gym?

McHENRY: Well, first of all, in
the new gym we are hoping that
everything will be completed and |
am confident that everything will be

completed before December | when
we open our season with UVA here
which will be an outstanding event.
Immediately following that we have
the W&L Invitational Basketball

Tournament on the 3rd and 4th of
December and the last week in Feb-
ruary our CAC Basketball Cham-
pionships will be held here. This
year unfortunately the CAC will be
down to four teams in basketball.
Washington University has dropped

 

Pi

oe

“Pm convinced that the program we are operating now is the only type of

out of the basketball league and
they have been placed on probation
and have been given one year to get
back in order on this. We are hope-
ful that they will come back into it
the next year. If not they will be
dropped from the conference. We
also have the NCAA college divi-
sion swimming championships here
in March.

QUESTION: You just happened
to mention Washington University.
What do you think is the future of
the CAC? What if Washington
doesn't get together and come back
in. Do you think the CAC will just
stay with four teams? Do you
think any other schools will drop
out because of budgetary matters?

McHENRY: Well this is a diffi-
cult question for me to answer right
now. | have been involved in one
CAC meeting which was held last
May and I was very disappointed at
that time to learn that Washington
University had dropped basketball
and that Southwestern University
had dropped swimming from their
programs. There has been a great
deal of talk about further expansion
in the CAC and I personally believe
that something has to be done in
order to have the conference sur-
vive. | don't think we can go along
with 4 teams or 3 teams in some of
the areas and I would like to hope
that we could bring in and attract
some schools that have similar phil-
osophies and programs that we are
trying to have at our schools and
perhaps add some schools to the
conference. The biggest problem as
far as | am concerned with our con-
ference right now is with the travel.
In addition we don't seem to have
the natural rivalry with some of
these schools that are so far remov-
ed from Washington and Lee, There
of course is the possibility that we
may eventually venture into some
other type of conference arrange-
ments, This is very premature and
nothing has been done so far.

QUESTION: What do you think
about the intercollegiate sports here?
Do you think that they will decline
or that they are declining in favor
of intramurals considering the num-
ber of freshmen that come out for
the different sports?

McHENRY;: I don't think so at
all. I think that we are in an age
where there is a lack of participation
in some areas and yet I don't think

it has affected our athletic program
here. When you look at the number
of people that we have out for foot-
ball, right now we are well over 70.
and we have a good nucleus of
freshmen that are out. Also, we
have a good nucleus of freshmen
that are out for soccer, I think that
the participation at Washington and
Lee in our athletic program is excel-
lent. I just talked to a close friend
of mine who used to coach here and

athletics for this type of institution.
I think in the next 10 or 20 years
we are going to see a polarization of
schools that are going to have major
programs but this will be a very,
very small number of schools. I also
think that many of the schools are
going to have to follow the same
policy and philosophy that Washing-
ton and Lee adopted some 16 or 17
years ago.

QUESTION: | can think of some

 

program a school of W&L’s size and basic philosophy can operate under.”

who is now the athletic director and
football coach at Haverford College.
They are having some severe prob-
lems. And we noticed some changes
and participation in the last few
years when | was in Lebanon Valley
College but | think Washington and
Lee is in a very healthy situation
We want a good strong sound intra-
mural program. I think Coach
Verne Canfield is doing an excellent
job with our intramural program.

QUESTION: What do you think
some of our advantages are of stay-
ing in the CAC? Are there any?

McHENRY: One of the advant-
ages of course is that we are cur-
rently associating with some fine
colleges and universities that have
similar philosophies to Washington
and Lee University. I think there is
always an advantage to associate
yourself with other people and other
universities that have the same basic
philosophy. | would say this is the
basic advantage right now. The
greatest disadvantage that I mention-
ad before is the travel factor and
the lack of real rivalry here. We are
not a scheduling conference. Except
in football, we do not play the other
schools in regular schedules at the
present time. We are just a cham-
pionship conference.

QUESTION: How do you feel
about scholarships? I understand
that you were here at school when
we were carrying on the scholarship
program and you have seen it from
both sides. What do you think?

McHENRY: Well I'm convinced
that the program that we are oper-
ating right now is the only type of
program that a school of Washing-
ton and Lee’s size and basic philoso-
phy can operate under. | grew up
under the old system for I was here

enjoyed it very much and I must ad-
mit that at the time the decision was
made to change that I felt, as so
many other alumni, that it was a
poor decision, Now | am convinced
more than ever that what we have
done has been the right philosophy
to follow. | have coached now for
the past 16 years under a non-sub-
sidized program where the philoso-
phy is similar to what we have here
and I am convinced that this is the

examples of schools who are smaller
than we, such as Davidson and |
think VMI is at least keeping its
head above water. How is it com-
parable to continue such a program,
and I point to Davidson especially
where they have been in the top ten
in basketball. How can they accom-
plish this where as you don’t think
we can?

McHENRY: Well | think in the
cases that you cited, both Davidson
and VMI have had some fantastic
problems in the last few years.
Davidson is, currently, as | under-
stand it undergoing some real
changes in their thinking in the type

of program that they are involved
in. They have had a severe cut back
in their football program for ex-
ample. In basketball apparently they
are still trying to maintain the image
that they set a few years ago. VMI
certainly has had great difficulty
with their program, they have main-
tained a major college program but
| read the other day where they
have had the poorest won and loss
record of any college in the United
States in their three major sports—
football, basketball and baseball. I
would not be inclined to say that
they are keeping their head above
water. I have the greatest admiration
for their coaching staff and in what
they are trying to do but I think
they are swimming up-tide right
now.

QUESTION: How is the W&L re-
cruiting effort? | know that this
time last year we talked to Athletic
Director Corrigan and he said that
WAL is really going to have to try
to get the alumni and students and
the coaches and everybody out to
help with the recruiting. Have you
found that you are getting the kind
of athletes to build a successful pio-
gram?

McHENRY: Well we are it some
areas, in other areas we need to im-
prove upon our recruiting efforts
Certainly with the success that our
basketball team has enjoyed in the
last few years—they won 4 out of
the last 5 CAC championships and
they have had very fine seasons. |
think Coach Canfield has done an
outstanding job of recruiting. Coach
Szlasa has done an outstanding job
of recruitment of lacrosse players
and in the latest ratings that just
came out a couple of weeks ago we
are seventh in the nation and rated
the finest small college lacrosse
team in the country. We hope to
have the same type of success in all
of our sports and in order to achieve
this we must get help from our stu-
dent body an dour alumni. You stu-
dents are in the best position to sell
your friends from your hometowns

Rebuilding Year

(Continued from page 4)

In the backfield, behind Fluharty,
will be senior co-captain JoJo Mar-
tin. “JoJo is a tough competitor, and
has looked good in practice,” Leslie
commented. For once, the coaching
staff thinks that it will have good
depth in the offensive backfield.
Sophomore Lewis Powell is the
number two quarterback. He lacks
experience, but is capable of running
the ball club, Both quarterbacks will
have difficulty developing a ground
game, and the rush will primarily
be used to keep the defenses honest,
and as a diversion.

Coach Leslie called this the tough-
est schedule that has been played by
his program. It is certainly the
toughest in recent memory. New
this year are Bucknell and the Coast
Guard Academy. Returning from
last years grind are Hampden-Syd-
ney, Towson State, and Western
Maryland.

“We haven't scheduled a win,”
grinned Coach Leslie. That is an un-
derstatement. General fans should
see some excellent football teams
this fall. Defensively, the Blue must
improve, They gave up 250 points in
nine games last season. Returning to
anchor this year’s version will be co-
captain Dave Brooks, Marshall
Washburn, and Tim Haley. Several
of the quicker freshmen have switch-
ed to the defense. The coaching staff
promises an improvement, If it
comes, the Generals could have a
real competitor.

With the return of Fluharty and
The Bomb, the W&L gridders will
definitely be an exciting team to
watch. There will be a lot of ques-
tion marks to fill, and with a few
timely breaks, the Generals could be
an outstanding team.

As a unique educational enter-
prise W&L’s Mock Convention has
traditionally allowed students an in-

by the real delegates themselves. In
addition, this year’s convention will
serve a second purpose—as Campi-
longo explained, “Because of re-
forms that have taken place in the
last few years, we will have an un-
usual opportunity to test the efficacy
of those changes prior to Miami. In
effect, the 1972 Mock Convention at

Chambers Brothers,

(Continued from page 1)

Senior Bert Meem, President of
the Dance Board, has already an-
nounced the visiting artists for two
concerts this fall. On October 23,
the Chambers Brothers will high-
light Homecomings weekend. On
November 20, Canadian folk star
Gordon Lightfoot will appear in
concert.

A highlight of winter Dance
Board activities may well be the re-
vival of Washington and Lee's tra-
ditional Fancy Dress weekend,
which may feature 5 to 8 hour con-
cert-dance. Among those being con-
sidered for a Fancy Dress appear-
ance are Littke Richard, Chuck
Berry, and Bo Diddley.

The Board is also considering ne-
gotiations with Rod Stewart, Leon
Russell, Rita Coolidge and The
Grateful Dead for possible appear-
ances later in the year.

Meem is hopeful of adding extra
events to the regularly scheduled
five concerts. He urges students to
purchase dance plans, to aid not
only in obtaining the best possible
talent for the regular shows but also
in providing possible additional per-
formances.

play “Luther” will be held at the R.
E. Lee Episcopal Church on Friday
evening, September 17.

The drama depicts the life of the
man whose spiritual struggles led
him to split Christendom apart and
arouse some of the most bitter pas-
sions and bloody wars in the history
of Western civilization. The play-
wright, John Osborne, shook the
British and American stage in the
mid-1950's with his drama, “Look
Back in Anger.”

Though “Luther” chronicles the
story of a famous leader of the Re-
formation, it is not regarded as a re-
ligious play to draw or repel one
denomination or another; rather, it
is a human drama of insight and
fiery emotional power.

Though Martin Luther did man-
age to provoke bitter controversy,
not to mention 200 years of religious
wars, Osborne's play about him
drew no particular controversy in
its original Londen and New York
runs, Audiences of all faiths regard-
ed it not as religious history, nor
even as pure biography, but rather
as a sweeping drama of size and
power about the most profound
human feelings

The New York drama critics be
stowed on “Luther” their annual
Critic's Circle Award as the best
play of the 1963.1964 season

The performance of “Luther” will
begin at 7:30 p.m. on Friday, Sep
tember 17. Tickets for the play are
$1 and may be obtained from the
office of the R, E. Lee Church dur
ing the hours of 9 to 4 tomorrow or
Friday of at the door on the even
ing of performance

Letters To The Editor .. .

 

 

(Continued from page 2)

cannot resist patient kindness and
gentle admonition.

The love of truth is equal in im-
portance to habitual obedience.
Every encouragement, even to the
pardoning of offenses, should be giv-
en to its cultivation. Children are
naturally truthful and they should
be accustomed to hear the truth al-
ways spoken; and candour, integrity
and confession of error, with a de-
testation of falsehood, dishonesty
and equivocation should be sedul-
ously inculcated. A strict adherence
to promises made to them is of the
utmost importance, as well as the
removal of all temptation to mis-
conduct. They should also be pre-
pared and warned against its attacks.

Sentiments of religion should be
early impressed upon the minds of
children by personal explanation
and systematic instruction. As the
intellect expands its sacred truths
will be comprehended and felt and
its motives and principles be stren-
gthened and confirmed by practice
and habit. An essential part of the
education of youth is to teach them
to serve themselves and to impress
upon them the fact that nothing
good can be acquired in this world
without labour; and that the very
necessaries and comforts of life must
be pursued by earnest and regular
exertion. They should also be taughi
to know that after having been rear-
ed and educated by their parents,

they should not expect them to fur-
ther provide for them; and that
their future subsistence and advance-
ment must depend upon themselves.
Parents sometimes commit the mis-
take of allowing their children after
having reached the period of life
when they ought to be engaged in
making a livelihood, to rely upon
them for support. This encourages
them in injurious idleness and de-
stroys that spirit of self dependence
which is necessary for their advance-
ment in life and causes them to ap-
pear so unreasonable as to depend
upon them, after having arrived at
the age of being able to think and
act for themselves,

The choice of a profession is not
of so much consequence as the man-
ner in which it is pursued, If habits
of self control and self denial have
been acquired during education the
great object has been accomplished,
Diligence and integrity in any useful
pursuit of life will be sure to secure
prosperity and fame and success will
result from engaging in that business
in which the generality of mankind
are interested,”

Copies of this letter can be ac-
quired in the museum below Lee
Chapel. Any other suggestions on
the purposes of education will be
welcome,
