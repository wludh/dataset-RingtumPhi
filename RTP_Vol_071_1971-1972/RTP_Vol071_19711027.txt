W&L Trustee Nominated For High Court

Franklin Powell, Jr, a
Washington and
and law schools and
a member of the University’s Board
of Trustees since 1961, nomi
nated for a position on the Supreme
Court by President Nixon _ last
Thursday uight.

Nixon ended weeks of speculation
by seeking congressional approval
for nominations of Powell, 64, and
Assistant Attorney General William
Rehnquist to fill the vacancies creat
ed by the retirements of two As
sociate Justices: the late Hugo Black,
and John Harlan.

Contacted by telephone yesterday
night, Powell said he was glad to
hear from the Ring-tum Phi again.
He told an anecdote about his de
either to run for editor-in
chief of the paper or for President
of the Student Body in 1929; he
ran for President and was elected.
Mr. Powell admitted “my life is
bedlam now,” but he agreed to alter

his interview policy to talk with the

Ring-tum Phi.

We asked Powell if he would
remain a trustee of Washington and
Lee. “I will stay on the Board if
it is compatible with the canons of
judicial ethics,” Powell stated. He
explained that there had already
been a “big row” over federal judges
sitting on the boards of corporations,

Powell cited the case of former
Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas,
who had been criticized for being
on the board of directors of a
corporation that was involved in a
before the high court. Since
Powell claimed that “a number
of judges have resigned from such
boards.” Powell expressed his desire
to remain on the University Board
of Trustees, saying he would be
“most reluctant to sever my con-
nections with W&L.”

Powell added that he planned to
appear before the Senate Judiciary
Committee in a hearing soon, “I

was told the hearing would be held
November 4, and that my presence
would be required.”

The W&L graduate was asked
when he found out about his nomi
nation by President Nixon, a ques-
tion he has previously declined to
answer for the reporting press,
Powell commented to us that “dis-
cussions had been made about my
possible nomination over a two-day
period. | was officiously told a week
ago tonight” (October 19).

“This nomination couldn't have
anything but beneficial results for
the school,” University President
Robert E. R. Huntley said. “This
constitutes recognition of the out-
standing achievement of one of our
law graduates, alumni, and most
loyal supporters.”

Huntley, a law professor himself,
continued, “Powell is the epitome
of achievement in his profession, He
stands for the kind of achievement
law school graduates can aspire to.

As a Board of Trustee
Lewis has performed with the same
hard work, full intelligence and good
advice he has shown in other fields.”

“My initial reaction was selfish,”
President Huntley added, “I felt
pride in my alma mater, which is
quite healthy, At further reflection
I sent a telegram of congratulation
to President Nixon on the selection
of a man of such stature as Mr.
Powell. I think he is unsurpassed in
qualifications, it would be especially
difficult to beat his handling of
difficult questions.”

Powell is currently senior partner

in the firm of Hunton, Williams,
Gay, Powell and Gibson, which he
joined in 1937. He served abroad

during the Second World War, ris-
ing to the rank of colonel and
receiving numerous honors from
both the American and French gov-
ernments.

The W&L graduates has served on
both the Richmond Board of Educa-

member,

National Commission
and Admini-

tion and the
on Law Enforcement
stration of Justice.

He is currently President of the
American Bar Foundation and has,
in the past, headed both the Ameri-
can College of Trial Lawyers and
the American Bar Association.

Powell, who holds a Master of
Laws degree from Harvard, gradu
ated from Washington and Lee with
a B.S. in Commerce, magna cum
laude, in 1929, In 1931, he received
his LL.B., emerging with the high
est academic average in his twenty-
one man class.

The High Court nominee served

a term as Student Body President
in 1929-30, and was also assistant
editor of The Ring-tum Phi. He

was elected to both Phi Beta Kappa
and Omicron Delta Kappa, and, in
1929, he was presented the Algernon
Sydney Sullivan Medallion, as that
student “who excels in high ideals
of living, in spiritual qualities, and

in generous and disinterested service

In 1960, Washington and Lee pre-
sented Mr. Powell with an honorary
Doctor of Laws Degree in recogni-
tion of “his generous and wise
leadership at the Bar, in civic en-
terprises, and in public service.”
The nominee holds honorary
degrees from Hampden-Sydney, Wil
liam and Mary, and the University
of Florida.

The New York Times quoted
President Nixon as praising Powell
as “a man who has accomplished
everything he has undertaken with
distinction and honor, both as a
lawyer and a citizen.”

“Lewis Powell is from Virginia,”
the Nixon quote in the Times con-
tinued, “But Lewis Powell is
recognized by his legal colleagues
throughout the nation as being a
man who represents not just Vir-
ginia and the South—he is first and
foremost a very great American.”

OuTLOOKandReview! Be

Wednesday, October 27, 1971

At the completion of rush for the last few years the
Ring-tum Phi has cast itself in the role of a grim prophet.
The prophecy espoused by this paper was the doom of the
fraternity system at Washington and Lee University. Such
a prophecy would not be quite apropos this year.

Judging from the current climate, the fraternities are not
dead. Yet, they appear to be infected with several cancers
which need treatment.

Rush itself emphasizes the numerous inadequacies of
W&L’s 15 houses. Almost any outsider who witnessed the
quad “riot” October 8 would have categorized the participants
as insane, inhumane, childish and barbaric. ABC fraternity
men were at the throats of XYZ members. Fights exploded
all across the brick courtyard. Somehow all this exuberance
seems sadly channeled. How does punching out people
prove that your house is the best? It was a wonder that some
brothers believed that their pledges were impressed, The
whole debacle was so out of hand that the university slapped
a small minority of the mob with social probation for various
offenses stich as smashing windows.

The preferential card system was run quite lackadaisically.
On Monday, October 11 freshmen were told by the Interfra-
ternity Council officials that they should fill out preferential
cards with their first, second, and third choices. The IFC did
not follow through with its end of the operation. Late that
afternoon an unmanned ballot box was placed in the fresh-
man quad, The number of cards accompanying the box was
limited, so several sheets of notebook paper were left there.
The result was that most freshmen did not complete their
preferential cards on that Monday. Actually, up until October
25 the IFC did not know for sure who had pledged for the
entire class.

Also rush seemed to drag on forever this fall. The de-
ferred system theoretically gave freshmen more time to pick
and choose among fraternities. But once again, a sizeable
portion of freshmen accepted bids to join the first evening of
rush dates. Freshmen to a large extent expressed their dis-
pleasure with the month and a half process. Upperlassmen
also quickly tired of the weekend-wrecking rush schedule.

These developments during rush form a concrete indict-
ment against the fraternities. But in the defense of the IFC
and its member fraternities, these complaints are not original,
just look back in the previously mentioned Ring-tum Phi
issues. The quad riot, a preferential card concept and delayed
rush have been criticized before.

So a defense can be raised for the fraternities. Kncourag-
ing to Greek advocates has been the pragmatic attitude taken
by the Interfraternity Council President Rob LaRue. LaRue
contends that fraternities must change. He believes that
houses can no longer depend on an influx of potential pledges.
Lakue emphasizes that freshmen now can operate vehicles,
plus have girls and liquor in their dormitory rooms. In previ-
ous years fraternities rushed hard on a triumvirate of wheels,
booze and dates. Under LaRue’s leadership the rush principles
have altered. A quick glance at the 1971 rush book will tell
you that the publication differs from those of the past. The
IFC rush book is not giving individual fraternities an op-
portunity to boast of their assets, as much as it is trying to
sell the fraternity system as a whole.

Despite all this criticism, some other aspects of rush were
encouraging. More freshmen participated in rush this year
than last year. The decline in pledging seems to be leveling
off, evidenced by approximately 61 per cent of the freshmen
class pledging. And that figure may increase. The phenomea
of increased pledging, combined with a trend of declining
depledging, may spell a more realistic percentage of men in
fraternities at Washington and Lee,

The fraternity system at W&L is not dying. However,
a look at rush amplifies the tremendous problems of the
Greek system. W&L continues to need the fraternities in a
very real sense. The various houses provide sleeping quarters
for many students and feed even a larger number of men
\lso the fraternities continue to be the keystone of social
life on campus. The university could not handle the obliga
tion of providing these services, currently rendered by the
fraternities. But if the fraternities want to Improve their lot,
they must act as a unit. Fifteen, feuding fraternities acting
individually will accomplish little. For a start some houses
would do well to listen to and learn from their IFC President
and seek some pragmatic solutions to their common problems

Editor’s note: Dr. William Bu-
chanan, W&L professor of Poli-
tics, is on leave during 1971-72
and is doing research in Belfast,
Northern Ireland. A former Edi-
tor of The Ring-tum Phi, he was
asked to comment on the current
‘situation there.

The first striking thing on the Bel-
fast scene is how easy it is to
disrupt the life of a major city
by determined sporadic violence on
the part of a few people—how easy
it is to do, but how hard to have
any political effect. The IRA activists
probably consist of a few thousand
persons (nobody really knows), al-
though a great many more are sym-
pathetic to them and even more
are intimidated by them.

Their objective is to bring the
center of Belfast to a halt by
Christmas by random bombing.
They may well succeed before that
time. Streets are far from empty,
but business is off 20 per cent in
the stores and 30 per cent in the
pubs, due as much to bomb scares
which require them to be emptied,
every threat being a credible one,
as to the actual bombs, The effect
is to make every trip of mine down-
town a minimal one.

The U.S. consulate had all its
front windows blown out from a
bomb in a police station across the
street. The bank where I have my
account had all its back windows
blown by a bomb in a parking lot
across the alley, and only the spun-
glass curtains prevented injury to
the clerks from flying glass. When
it came time for a check-up on
my new VW, I was advised to stay
away from one dealer, who was
in the Falls Road and had been hit
once; the other had so much work
as a result that he couldn't take me
for a month; so I drove out to a
town about 20 miles away for the
job.

We hear one or two explosions al-
most every night. The loudest last
week was a couple of blocks away,
in a bank next to where we buy
the daily paper. It injured two pass-
ers-by and blew the windows out
of the launderette where we leave
our washing.

Since 1 started to write this, 1
have marched downstairs and stood
on the campus with everybody else
in the social science building for a
brief drill. A security guard at the
entrance checks everybody as we
enter the building. (incidentally, the
Political Science department is in a
beautiful new building, dedicated a
year or two ago by Her Majesty,
and featuring these large areas of
glass characteristic of modern offices.
1 could do without the glass.)

The army is in evidence, mostly
patrolling the streets in Land Rovers,
one soldier facing forward, the other
back, with guns at ready. On the
way home the other day I saw one
in front of a nearby chemist's shop
(drug store), facing the street, gun
in hand. It turned out that there
was nothing more serious than that
his partner needed an aspirin, but
they must go in pairs with one on
guard when the other is preoc-
cupied.

Now the point of all this is that
with the vast amount of nuisance
it causes, and the enormous financial
loss to businessmen and to workers
who are laid off, many things go

last Situatio

on quite as usual because there
really isn’t much else one can do.
By noon the next day a very
efficient team from the city has
moved in and boarded up the win-
dows, and by the following week,
glass is usually back in and the
frames painted. Since the targets are
random, we are about as safe one
place as another. Aside from avoid-
ing the central city at night and
losing opportunities for theatre, din-
ing out and so on, people go on
about their business.

Life must be hellish for those in
the barricaded areas, with rock-
throwing, sniping, searches, and
women beating garbage can lids—
and children wandering though it
all—but I can’t describe that first
hand, and you probably see it on
TV as clearly as I do. These are
the people closest to the IRA
in sympathy. The rest of the city
goes on, far from normally and with
huge financial losses, but still effecti-
vely. | am reminded of the Strategic
Bombing surveys afer the Second
World War which staggered the Air
Force by showing how little effect
on production the truly disastrous
bombing of the cities had achieved.

The greatest nuisance at the mo-
ment is the water shortage. House-
hold water is cut off from 8 a.m.
to 8 p.m. We have a storage tank
in the attic which tides us over
if we don’t flush the toilets too often.
The shortage is due to the weather,
not the bombers, but they cooperat-
ed by blowing up a storage reservoir,
letting a few days supply run down
the gutter, and making one section
of the city dependent on tank trucks.

The almost instinctive approach of
an American political scientist to the
situation is: how can a_ solution,
or a compromise or an adjustment
between two sides be reached? The
answer is quite simple: it can’t. The
IRA is split into two groups, one
Marxist, the other reactionary;
neither recognizes the other and
neither will negotiate with the gov-
ernment, since they contend, as they
have for 50 years, that the govern-
ment of Northern Ireland is illegiti-
mate. There is a group of Social
Democrats in Parliament who are
fairly representative of the Catholic
community, but they refuse to ne-
gotiate with the government until
the 200 persons the government in-
terned (apparently a mixed bag of
genuinely dangerous gunmen and
elderly IRA has-beens) are released.

The moderates on the Protestant
side—the government—say they will
release the internees when the bomb-
ings stop, but of course the Catholic
moderates, with whom they would
negotiate, can't control the bombers.
The Protestant extremists—Paisley
and his cohorts—say the government
is being too lenient, and should
intern even more people, At the
moment Paisley appears to be efecti-
vely holding in check his red-neck
followers in the Shankill road, who
would like to move into the Catholic
area and conduct a real massacre,
and apparently have the guns to
do it. If this were to happen, the
only defense the Catholics would
have would be the IRA, so they
can't afford to discourage them.

The reason the Protestant es-
tremists are holding their followers
back is that they believe the IRA
is trying to provide them into overt

aggression. If they can bring down
the moderate government and take
their places, they might manage to
conduct their pogrom legally. So
Paisley and his M., P.’s have moved
across the aisle to sit on the op-
position bench which the Catholic
moderates vacated when they decid-
ed not to negotiate, At the moment,
the Faulkner government can prob-
ably maintain a majority without
them, but any actions that woul:
bring the Catholics to negotiate
would probably lose enough right
wing supporters that they wouldn't
be there themselves to negotiate
with them.

By LEX McMILLAN

In the Washington Post on Octo-
ber 18 was an article which was a
follow-up of a story run about two
weeks ago. Briefly the story was
that on October 4, 1971 a man
by the name of George M. Giffe
kidnapped his estranged wife and
with the aid of a friend hijacked a
privately owned plane and ordered
the pilot to take him to the Ba-
hamas. Well naturally the pilot was
pretty co-operative since he had a
45-caliber automatic rammed into
the back of his neck.

However. he didn’t have enough
fuel to get him from Nashville,
their point of departure, to the Ba-
hamas. He therefore made arrange-
ments to stop in Jacksonville. The
FBI was notified and was there wait-
ing. The news story of October 4
simply said the outcome was that
Gifle flipped out and shot the pilot,
his wife and then himself. All three
died,

The story of October 18 throws
a good bit more light on the story
and the reason for the deaths. In
fact the FBI shares a large part
of the responsibility for the deaths
beeause of their irresponsible “cops
and robbers” bravado and attempted
daring.

What the Pest obtained that shows
the FBI's inexcusable action is the
transcript of the communications
between the pilot and the control
tower. This transcript shows that
the pilot was led to believe that fuel
would be provided and cooperation
would be the tone of the handling
of the affair. However, when he
landed he was instructed to taxi over
to a hanger and wait, He saw no
fuel truck and asked about this.
He was put off until finally the FBI

 

“How were the ‘Chambers Brothers’ 7”

This is of course a vast over-
simplification, since it ignores the
pieces of the action held by the
British army, the British govern-
ment, the Eire government, the Ca-
tholic church, the Orange order, the
American groups which are supply-
ing money for gelignite (as they
have done for a century) and
Bernadette Devlin (who attracts
much less attention here than she
does in the U.S.) But it is enough
to indicate why the assumption that
something might be done, or that
the situation might get untangled, is
considered the most naive American
optimism.

   

 

took over the radio and informed
him that no fuel would be provided,

The last words of the transcript
provide a poignant indictment of
the federal agents who handled the
affair, Pilot: “This is 58 November
(plane's code name). Uh, this gentle-
man has about 12.5 pounds of
plastic explosives back here and. . .
uh, I got no... uh, yen to join
it right now so I would please
expr... uh, appreciate if you
would stay away from this air-
plane.” Downs, the pilot, then was
informed by an FBI agent that there
would be no fuel. His reaction was
fear and supplication for a reversal
of this decision. Pilot: “Uh (gasp),
look, I don’t think this fellow’s kid-
ding—I wish you'd get the fuel truck
out here.” Tower: “58 November,
There will be no fuel. I repeat.
There will be no fuel.” Pilot: “This
is 58 November, You are endanger-
ing lives by doing this, and, uh, we
have no other choice but to go along
and, uh, uh, for the sake of some
lives we request some fuel out here,
please.”

Well the FBI refused and the
outcome was that Giffe panicked
and committed the two murders
and then suicide, But that’s o.k.
because the FBI got their man.
Hooray! Of course 1 know they
would have prefered a live capture
and no dead innocents. Those dead
innocents are such gosh awful P.R.
Heard on the FAA tape recording
of the communications was the com-
ment, “you can't win ‘em all.” And

and sauntered off into the sunset.

The absolute lack of reason in
those three deaths is physically sick-
ening. It makes one begin to ponder
the type of man that must be an
FBI agent. | personally get an
image of an individual who can't
seem to find enough excitement in
life as it is today so he wants to
do some kind of “adventurous”
work, Now there are several options
open to this soldier of fortune
type. He could join the army and
kill little yellow people. Of course
that’s not exactly popular right now
and besides there doesn't seem to be
a very promising future in it
Though the FBI is under consider.

a pretty staid institution and there
aren't any concrete indications tha

The real lesson to be learned fron

Wednesday, October 27, 1971

By STEPHEN C, WOODRUFF

‘ a mixture of disparate,
unrelated subject matter, an eucrasy
of junk, an alloyage of garbage, a
miscellany of musings, a hodgepodge
of belief, a hotchpotch of idle
thoughts . . . That’s potpourri (no
question about that), and that’s what
this is.

Note that it took me four issues
to get this mess together (and prob-
ably another four to get it printed);
use that to judge as you will its
quality, There are at least two
Why ...

Unheeded parietals live on, while
the dorm resident never does know
when it is safe to go take a shower...

If Cottier has nothing better to
rat about than the unusual liason
between the management of the Co-
op and the upper echelon of the
Nixon administration, maybe he
should look into the strange simi-
larity in body design of the Ford
Pinto and the Chevrolet Vega.

Student Body President Steve
Robinson redefines Honor System as
“atmosphere of trust”. . . . Items
vanish from Co-op . . . Books dis-
appear from McCormick, Bookstore

. University Center Committee
has members do guard duty at
dances .. . Evans Dinning Hall has
pictured ID cards made up for
contract students . Instructor
feels he cannot define what he
expects on “pledged” homework . . .
Money disappears from open gym
locker . . . The Honor System is
alive and thriving at W&L. Or is it?

Ah, yes . . . | almost forgot
the single item that was my inspira-
tion to write this in the first place
. . « What evil lurks in the strange
area of the basement of Washington
Annex II? Word has it (although
through a most  undependable
source) that not even the president
of this university really knows what
takes place there. And, of course,
the author of all this scandalous
commentary never bothered to ask
him (or anyone else who might
know, for that matter), all in the
interest of good journalism. But
speculation, even professed knowl-
edge, concerning its function
abounds . . .

. naturally, all of the unusual
and unknown here is incorporated
into the clandistine atmosphere sur-
rounding the double-locked door and
the bricked-up windows . . . For
instance, why is it that snow is
never present but always melts on
the walk connecting Washington
Hall and Washington Annex I??.. .
And what of the mass of electrical
cables entering the computer center,
when an IBM 1130 can run on
house current? . . . and the strange
pipes that leave and re-enter the
basement? . . . And, better yet,
what about those four enormous
fans that seem to serve no function
other than to blow air at those
mysterious pipes? ...7? Or,...
why don't they tear down the old
furnace building on the back
campus???

But enough of the unknown, what
of the scholarly efforts to put all
the puzzle pieces together? Spies
have gathered information on the
coming and going of personnel, have
studied the physical aspects of the
building in question, and have even
made efforts to trace the electrical
cables (who says they have to be
incoming power cables) to the
ROTC building or the basements
of the freshman dorms. Other data

Miscellany Of Musings:

has undoubtedly been collected,

Word has it that the building
serves a national security function,
(but that is a boring hypothesis and
engages little discussion), Others
claim it and the old furnace build-
ing serve as entrances to a cavern
beneath the colonade and Lee
Chapel... They attest to the pres-
ence of an underground network
of electronic cables and devices . . .
Proponents of this theory hold that
the basement of Washington Annex
IL houses equipment to control the
environment within the cavern.

Speculation as to the function of
the cavern is not in dearth, either. . .
Word again has it that the Consti-
tution was kept there during the
war (this is an almost universally
accepted belief, although nobody
seems to know which Constitution
or which war,).

Being (like Lex MeMillan) not
inclined toward paranoia, I won't
venture to claim or even suggest

  

| Potpourri

or speculate that the freshman-dorms
are bugged or that we are victims
of a diabolical plan to control men’s
minds . .

In response to Mr. Small’s  be-
wailment of the academic situation
... Yes, “crib” courses are many,
and most of us know which they
are. And yes, many do seek them
out. But . » such courses and
people exist everywhere . . . and
do additional graduation: require-
ments “challenge” an individual, do
they add to his store of ‘useful
knowledge on his departure from
this institution, do they permit him
to follow his field of special interest
to any real height? Perhaps, prob-
ably not. The value of an education
can only be dependent upon what
the individual will let it become.
Some do not hunt out “crib”
courses. There’s a lot to be learned.

Very seriously — while in that
vein—I must commend the EC this

Selection Method Being
Challenged In Court

By JOHN F, ZINK

The methods used by the national
political parties to choose delegates
for the national conventions, to be
held next year, are being challenged
in court and may be changed by the
Supreme Court.

The situation involves’ the applica-
tion of the Supreme ‘Court’s “one
person, one vote” doctrine; the out-
come of which will ‘affect the politi-
cal power of the ‘states in the con-
ventions. Any ruling by the Supreme
Court could determine, to a great
extent, who will be nominated dur-
ing the conventions,

In the past, the method of dele-
gate selection has been determined
by a plan devised by each party
at its national convention. The plan,
to take effect for the next conven-
tion, is generally based on a “pro-
portional-representation” basis, The
plan, which is to be administered
by the party’s national committee, is
fixed and is unchangeable until the
next convention.

Two lawsuits have caused the
court action. One is sponsored by a
group of “liberal” Democrats, while
the other is sponsored by the State
of Georgia and was issued while
Lester’ Maddox was Governor in
1970.

The law suit brought by the State
of Georgia asks that the number of

» delegates be determined by the pop-

ulation of the state. This would
be the “one person, one vote” rule
and would give the Southern states
the power to dominate next year’s
Democratic convention. The plan
proposed by the “liberal” Democrats
calls for a “one Democrat, one vote”
rule in determining the number of
delegates allocated to each state.
Meanwhile, the Democratic National
Committee opposes these actions and
maintains that its present plan is
quite adequate.

The three plans for the seating of
Democratic delegations, as reported
in “U. Ss News & World Report,”
are as follows: Democratic National
Committee Plan, number of «dele-
gates is to be determined by a
formula which is based on a states
population as well as the number
of Demoeratic voters in the -past
three presidential elections, “Liberal”
Democratic Plan, number of dele-
gates to be determined by the Demo-
cratic vote in a state in the recent
presidential elections. Georgia's
Plan, number of delegates would be
determined by the total population
of a state without regard to. party
affiliation.

Joseph A. Califano, Jr. general
counsel for ‘the*Demoeratie National
Committee was quoted in “U.S,
News & World Report” as saying,
“the Supreme Court could wind up
in dictating the delegates to both
national conventions next year.”

W&L Captures First Win
As W. Maryland Falls 14-7

Awesome Rushing Game
Balances Attack; Purser
Totals 130 on 24 Rushes

By LEWIS HIXSON

The Generals must have
pleased with the homecoming
tion at halftime because they
out of the dressing room to
a touchdown and break a 7-7 tie
in winning their first game of the
season, Yes, on this rain soaked
Saturday before a good homecoming
crowd the W&L Generals defeated
the Green Terror of Western Mary-
land by a score of 14-7 to erase the
zero in the win column.

If one had to pick out a hero
in this game, it would have to be
Lat Purser. He came into the game
in the second quarter to run for
130 yards on 24 carries and scored
one touchdown. Steve Fluharty was
unable to use the pass effectively
due to the rain so he stayed on the
ground, using the ability of his back-
field to grind out 227 yards rush-
ing. Because of this, the Blue con-
trolled a majority of the time on
the clock and gave the defense add-
ed rest. The defense reciprocated in
allowing the Green Terror only one
touchdown in the first quarter.

he first score in the game came
after an interception of a Fluharty
pass by Orndorff of Western Mary-
land. With the ball on the Western
Maryland 44, on the first play from
scrimmage, Brockmeyer swept right
end for 56 yards and a touchdown,
The point after was good and with

been
selec-
came
score

11:12 left in the half, Western

Maryland led 7-0.

Back came W&L after Purser re-
turned the kickoff 26 yards to his
own 33. Getting all of the yardage
on the ground, the Generals moved
down for the score in 13 plays.
Purser carried the ball 9 times for 51
yards in the drive before Fluharty
went over for the score from the
one. Doug Chase added the extra
point and with 7:05 remaining in
the half, it was 7-7. That terminated
the scoring in the first half.

In the third quarter W&L got the
ball at the Western Maryland 47
after a Yates punt, Once again, gain-
ing all of the yardage on the ground,
the Blue marched for a touchdown
in nine plays. Again, it was Purser
who was the workhorse of the opera-
tion. He gained 29 yards in five
carries and also went in for the score
from five yards out. The score came
with 49 seconds left in the third
quarter and with the addition of the
PAT the scoreboard read 14 to 7
in favor of the Generals.

Neither team was able to move
the ball in the fourth quarter. The
only threat coming on a fumble
by Purser at the W&L 42. The
Green Terror managed to make one
first down moving the ball to the
W&L 25 before Bill Wallace in-
tercepted a Bricker pass at the 23
and returned it 14 yards to the 37
The game ended with W&L on the
right end of the scoreboard by a
14 to 7 count.

The Generals should be up after
this win and they will have to stay
up if they are going to beat Sewanee
next week. Sewanee has a tough

team and a reputation of being
unbeatable at their home field, where
the game will be played, this Satur-
day. The remainder of the Gen-
erals’ schedule looks awesome with
three CAC opponents yet to come
and a lopsided tilt with Coast Guard.

Booters Capture

Third Victory

The W&L soccer team traveled to
Williamsburg last week to meet a
William and Mary squad that was
tough, Away came the  booters
though with an easy 3-2 victory that
improved their season’s record to
3-4.

Two of the General's scores came
in the first quarter as the booters
commanded the game early, Rolfe Fr",
Piranian headed the first score and ©. & _r
Mike Shaffer soon added another
goal on a left-footed goal mouth
shot. William and Mary could not

Ruggers Crush
Virginia, 19-6

If going out on a limb and main-
taining the possible win against
seemingly formidable odds, as was
done in this space last week, gives
the W&L Rugby Club the needed
edge, | should follow up and do the
same for the NC State game to be
played there this Halloween (Sun-
day). Of course, last week’s com-
ments didn’t bring the additional
support they solicited, just good
rugby. And, unfortunately, there is
no real evidence that it was the
words printed here that brought the
win. Perhaps it was the new jerseys.

But enough of the mystical power
of words appearing in this paper.
Yes, the rumors you have heard
are true, W&L did defeat U.Va. in
rugby competition on Alumni Field
Sunday. And it was the ruggers
who won it, no words, great or
small, regardless of where they ap-
peared, spoken or printed.

Boasting an incredible defense
and a strong scrum, the Blue
fought their way through a score-
less first half. Pursuit and good
tackling was the key to stopping
U.Va.’s always powerful offense. The
U.Va. offense was quick and handl-
ed the ball well.

At the beginning of the second
half, the word was out among the
WAL ruggers, “hit ‘em hard here,
early, The game’s going to be won
or lost in the first five minutes of
this half.” Things looked tough at
the outset, as U.Va. gained pos-
session of the ball near the W&L
goal line only seconds into the half.
For a few brief minutes (or were
they hours), the Blue held a tre-
mendous goal line defense, and fin-
ally a W&L kick placed the ball
well down field, and the Blue were
out of trouble, For a time, the ball

| have not had the opportunity

Pittsburgh Pirates played — like

Some of these scores sound like

race early between Cornell’s Ed

Basketball

Turnout

Impresses Canfield

W&L basketball is in full swing
with coach Verne Canfield’s team
looking to improve last year’s 17-8
record.

Twenty-one candidates turned out
for the start of practice, among
them, ten letermen, all of whom
started at least one game. Canfield
was pleased with the turnout but
complained that he had to cut some
fine players, “It’s good for the pro-
gram but it’s tough to tell a good
kid he can’t make it.”

Among the returning players is
senior captain Mike Daniels, who
should move into the third spot in
career scoring at W&L. A strong
corps of guards returns with Hatton
Smith, Doug Clelan, Ellie Gutshall
and Charlie Strain. Paul McClure,
Bob Pop, Dave Stone and John
Glace will help out underneath.
Scott Wood, a senior who played
freshman ball, is back to help out
in the backcourt.

Canfield is also pleased with what
he calls “the best group of fresh-
men in the past five years.” Stand-
outs among the freshmen include
Guy Kerr, Boman Williams, and
Stu Nibley.

Canfield stressed that he will not
have a set starting five. “We like
to play a lot of people,” said the
coach. “We like to get people to
feel like they’re contributing to the

Thus Canfield feels that this year’s
team is better than last year’s, but
that their overall performance will
depend on “how fast the kid’s get
together,”

Canfield’s team in recent years
have depended on a controlled style
of play and the scoring of the big
men. This year’s team will run and
press more, resulting in what Can-
field calls “a more exciting and
open game.” Quickness and speed
will make up for a general lack of
height.

The Generals open the season on
Dec. 1 against U.Va., one of their
toughest opponents, in the new gym.
Their will be 16 home games, in-
cluding the annual W&L Invitational
Tournament and the C.A.C, Tourna-
ment. There will be a frosh game
before most of the home games.

cg * Eo

B-ball notes:

Over the past five years, Canfield’s
teams have won better than 68%
of their games, making hime one of
the winningest coaches in W&L his-
tory.

Students will be allowed to play on
the new courts, despite rumors to
the contrary. Coach Canfield said
there was never any plan to bar
students from the new gym, add-
ing that such a move would be

program no matter how much they completely contrary to W&L’s

Spong Gives Convention Keynote

(Continued from page 1)
people running as delegates be elimi-
nated, to allow. better qualified
people, who could not previously
afford the luxury, to run for that
position,

Spong also cited the need for
reform in the field of campaign
costs, He hypothesized that candi-
dates are actually involved in two
campaigns, one wit hthe voters and
campaigns, one with the voters and
jected the spending of 400 million
dollars in 1972, and he warned of
the danger of this increased spend-
ing.

“It's approaching the point where
an independent may be barred from
public office” because of his in-
ability to muster up the necessary
campaign funds, the senator noted,
He also alluded to the fact that
a large donor, such as a big business,
would force the candidate to take
up its issues rather than those of
the people.

He then proposed that campaign
expenditures be publicly reported to
bring campaign spending under con-
trol. He suggested that disclosure
of financial connections, both pub-
lic and private, would help put
campaigning into a feasible position
for any serious candidate wishing to
run for office.

The native of Portsmouth then
expressed his greatest disappointment
in Congress thus far—its “failure
of reform of the Electoral College.”
He proposed an exit of the “faith-
less slector,” who casts his vote as
he pleases, not necessarily in ac-
cordance to his state’s wishes. He
also proposed a new voting system

mount any attack and they played
the majority of the first half in their
goal area. The poor field conditions,
pot holes and torn turf along with
mud, hampered both teams consid-
erably.

The last W&L score was a goal
mouth shot by Jim Fox. With a
comfortable 3-0 lead, the Generals
settled down and a roused William
and Mary team converted two quick
goals in the early fourth quarter.
This was the only slack the Generals
hit as the entire team added their
abilities to the cause. If anyone can
be singled out, it would be captain
Meade Kampmueller for his leader-
ship.

This Wednesday afternoon ai the
Liberty Hall field the Generals meet
the Keydets of VMI. On Saturday,
the Midshipman, ranked fourth na-
tionally, play host to W&L at An-
napolis,

which would combine the popular
vote with the electoral vote in de-
termining the president.

He concluded that all of these
reforms are necessary in today’s
political scene. Spong ended his
speech by noting that these reforms
“will enhance public trust of the
integrity of those who make and
administer the law.”

Spong then entertained questions
from the audience. Some of the
major points of discussion, and his
views, are as follows:

Supreme Court nominations:
Spong feels that Lewis Powell will
be confirmed with little trouble, but
he labelled himself unqualified at
the time to make any predictions on
William Rehnquist.

Third parties in 1972: The senator
expressed the distinct possibility of
third and possible fourth — party
movements next year, especially if
certain factions of the Democratic
party are not appeased by the
nomination of that party.

The draft: The speaker seriously
doubted if the needs of security
could be met by an_ all-volunteer
army at this time. He personally
supported a one-year extension of
the draft rather than the two-year
form which was passed, He cited
cost of, and divisiveness over, the
war as prime factors in the future
of the draft,

only by their extensive advertising
which proclaimed “the cheapest
prices” among the towns’ eight sta-
tions. Although their prices are less
than most stations within the city-
limit, they hope to draw on the
large student clientele, now pur-
chasing from the fixed-price mer-
chants,

Ihe idea for the station grew out
of the four roommates’ need for a
garage to rebuild and work on
motorcyles. They approached Hamm
about renting the garage portion for
their workshop. He in turn pro-
posed they take over the entire
operation of the then dormant sta-
tion. After a week's deliberation,
they jumped into the business with
all the high-hopes of any young
businessman. After only two weeks
they have “cleared” all their initial
investment.

They have purposely lowered their
prices hoping to attract students,
Thus far, however, most of their
business has come from tourists.
With the end of the price war in
scenic Buena Vista, they anticipate
increased sales.

chines are affecting the jurisdiction
of the Honor System.

“If | were a student from some
high school visiting W&L and was
told how well the Honor System
worked here,” said Secretary Rick
Gray, “if the first thing I was asked
was for an ID card in the Dining
Hall, | might have some doubts,”

JoJo Martin moved that the
present discussion be tabled until
the following week and that, in the
meantime, a poll be conducted to
determine the desire of students who
eat in Evans Hall to remove the
machine procedure. There was some
debate as to whether or not a poll
of this nature was germane to the
central question, i.c., whether the -
machines effectively serve as a de-
triment to the Honor System. The
motion ultimately passed, 5-4, with
one abstention.

The final topic of the evening was
the annual Honor System survey.
Steve Robinson, President, asked
whether or not the EC felt that a
survey at this time was necessary,
and if so, in what form, Rick Gray
doubted “how many people sincerely
answer “such surveys, citing the poor
response of students to last year’s

survey.
It was stiggested that students
could conceivably be bombarded

with surveys this year, and the EC
decided to table the question until
“it can be determined if the poll
is really needed.”

Honest man will work for room and
board with another from Nov. 1.
