E.C. Supports Coeducation

By JOHN F. ZINK

The Executive Committee, meet-
ing Monday night, heard arguments
by committee members and specta-
tors for and against the proposal
that Washington and Lee go co-
educational in the future. After the
various opinions were voiced on the
subject, a vote was taken endorsing
coeducation, nine to three,

Steve Robinson, President of the
Student Body, stated that he was
in favor of the move towards co-
education. Robinson said that
coeducation is essential to main-
tain the high quality of education
at Washington and Lee. One repre-
sentative raised the question of
whether or not it was proper for
the Executive Committee to make
a statement concerning the subject
of coeducation before the matter
comes up before the entire student
body in the form of a referendum
during the spring.

Robinson then asked for remarks
from the audience. One student said
that the objection raised against co-
education on the basis that it would
disrupt the course structure was un-
founded. He pointed out that the
courses are in a constant state of
change regardless of coeds or not.
He also voiced the opinion that a
move towards coeducation would

improve the financial position of
the university by making it a more
attractive recipient of government
and private donations.

Objections to coeducation were
raised by Mike Brittin, sophomore
representative. Brittin§ stated that
there were no immediate plans for
expansion of the campus facilities.
He stated that the increase in stu-
dents would add too many students
to an already over-extended student
body. Other objections were that the
admission of women would hurt the
science courses, make the Honor
Code unenforceable, cause the
alumni to lose their identity with
Washington and Lee, and would
cause WAL to lose an aspect of its
uniqueness,

Representative John McCarthy
stated that the Executive Commit-
tee’s function was not to lay out a
plan for coeducation, He = said
“There are many ways to impliment
the coeducational idea.” McCarthy
also stated, “The point now is to
come out with a statement; to get
the student body behind this issue
is the only way to get it going.”

Glenn Azuma, agreeing with Mc-
Carthy, said, “The Executive Com-
mittee must lead the students,”

Rick Gray. Executive Committee
Secretary, stated that the E.C.

should act as an educational body;
the student body should know all
of the facts and figures.

Lock Handley, Senior Law Rep-
resentative, said, “We should dis-
cuess it (coeducation) in public in
order to be fair to those who hold
the minority opinion.”

Several members of the audience
voiced support for coeducation. One
student said that, “We are limiting
ourselves as a university.” He stat-
ed that by going coeducational, the
education we receive will be com-
plete. Another student stated that
as it stands now, the supposition
is that the male/female relation-
ship is rather unimportant. He
continued, “You (Executive Com-
mittee) do have powers of sug-
gestion to the faculty and student
body. This is a matter which re-
quires your attention.”

John McCarthy, urging a formal
statement, said “We should make
it an important issue. We should
either say that we are for it, or
that we are against it.” With that
statement, Glenn Azuma, Vice-
President of the Executive Com-
mittee, made the motion that the
Executive Committee endorse the
concept of coeducation at Washing-
ton and Lee. Before the vote could
be taken, however, Lock Handley

Stewart Udall Opens ‘Contact’ Forum

By PAUL LANCASTER

Stewart Udall. former Secreta*y
of the Interior with the Kenned
and Johnson administration, kicked
off this year’s “Contact” program
last evening by “unloading (his)
environmental hay” in a talk on
ecology.

Udall opened with excerpts from
his latest article, “Robert Frost,

Kennedy, and Khrusechev: A Memoir
of Poetry and Power,” in which he
presented a brief study of the three
men in relation to one another. The
speaker expressed hopes for the
article to be published by a na-

28 Students Chosen

tional magazine in the near future.

Udall then turned to ecology,
basing his speech on quotations
from two eminent scientists: Dr.
Albert Schweitzer—“Man lacks the
capacity to foresee and forestall...
he will destroy the earth.” and
Loren Eiseley—“The Terror of our
age in man’s conception of himself.”

Udall then noted “Mankind’s last
broad and basic change occurred at
the Rennaissance. We've come to
the climax of that period in the
the vast, futuristic thinking of “pro-
past few years.” He stated that
ductivity weapons and

space missions” just a decade ago
has been seriously questioned.
People “thought growth was a good
quantitative yardstick.”

He specified Rachel Carson and
thing and measured (progress) by
her book, “Silent Spring.” as the
beginnings of the change of thought
we afe now experiencing. The en-
vironmental issue grew and de-
veloped until the point where we
are finally realizing that “the doubl-
ing and re-doubling of everything
could not continue. The ecosystem
will not tolerate for all the people
of this planet, which increased in

Phi Beta Kappa List Revealed

Twenty-eight Washington and

“Growth at this point is incom-

mental quality.” Udall continued.
We've begun “to pay attention to

the topsoil is thin . the atmo-
sphere is thin . . . and the life
zone of the oceans is just a few

he stated, citing that we are but
six percent of the population of the
world while at the same time we
are utilizing 35 per cent of the
world resources. But Udall was
optimistic. “This (present environ-
mental concern) could be, may very
well be, a period of historic change.

We have to recognize our limits

man's concept in himself.”

Udall hinted that we are learn-
ing from our mistakes. “The great-
est contribution of the space pro-
gram was a look at our-
selves .. . and that the solar system
is dead pretty conclusively. Earth
is where we'd better concentrate
our efforts.”

The former Cabinet member
turned to the population problem

the pollution on this planet. The
feeling is growing that if we want
to save the environment, we've got

enormous changes in the lives of
our young people.

“For the first time in history,
the growth of a city or a nation
is not particularly good. For the
first time in our history, the birth
of a child is more tragedy than

volved that we've only begun to
talk about.”

Udall concluded by proclaiming
that today's youth “is the generation
that must begin (to attack the prob-
lem) before the century is out,”
Their great task involves “being

responsibilities of the future, and
rediscovering ourselves, humanity.

asked if he could give his reason
for an affirmative vote. Handley
said, “Our society is changing, one
change is in the way men and
women look at each other; an all
male school does not fit into this
change.” Handley continued, “I
would rather see this school fall
on its face going in the right di-
rection, than for it to continue as
a type of ‘game preserve’ for male
chauvinism. We are avoiding our
responsibility if we do not realize
the trend today.”

President Robinson then called
for a vote on the Azuma motion;
the motion carried in favor of co-
education nine to three. Robinson
also stated that at next week’s meet-
ing there would be a similar dis-
cussion on the concept of re-institut-
ing required English courses.

Here Feb. 12

Slicked-back hair, undershirts,
dirty jeans, white socks and ciga-
rette packs rolled up in shirt sleeves
will all return to Lexington a week
from Saturday when Sha-Na-Na
rolls back into town. This year's
Fancy Dress concert should even be

better than last year’s show by
Sha-Na-Na which had to be the
all-time favorite concert at W&L.

The reasons are this year’s costume-
dance format and the sale of beer at
the dance.

Leading off the February 12
activities will be the University
Cocktail party at the Buffalo Creek
Pavilion. Grain will once again be
served and continuous music will
be provided by two bands, but the
length of this year’s party has been
doubled to four hours, from 2 p.m.
to 6 p.m. It's even expected that
the grain will last that long.

Dance Board officials are hoping
that there will still be enough people
standing after the cocktail party to
come to Sha-Na-Na’'s concert-dance
in Evans Dining Hall that evening.
Admission will be restricted to those
wearing 1950's style outfits or
formal clothes, The former is ex-
pected to prevail along with greas-
ed hair. The dance will begin at
9 p.m. and last until | p.m. The
Embers will start the music and
will be followed by Sha-Na-Na
sometime after 11 p.m,

In addition to the music and
costumes, the dance will feature
some thirty kegs of draft beer to
be sold at a nominal price. Be-
cause the beer will be sold under
ARA’s liquor license, students will
not be allowed to bring liquor into
the dance. Anyone caught doing so
will be either relieved of their bottle
or ejected from the dance with or
without their bottle. Tickets may
be purchased either in the Co-op
or at the door for $5 per person.

| OUTLOOK and REVIEW

Washington and Lee has spent several thousand dollars
over the last three years to improve the university parking
situation. Despite the school's efforts, the parking problem is
clearly worse than three years ago. Here is a brief review of
what has happened.

Four parking lots have been constructed, One is at the
foot of the Colonnade across Jefferson Street from the Phi
Kappa Sigma house. This lot is packed to its limits. Any late
evening you would discover that the small lot is far from
empty. Red Square residents and apartment tenants in the
vicinity merely leave their vehicles there almost around the
clock for days.

The second new lot is over one half mile from the univer-
sity academic buildings. Deserted is the best deseription of
this gravel blunder. Nobody uses the lot except for intercol-
legiate and intramural games on the Upper Field. Well, al-
most; it seems that some students drive up there to consume
alcohol or to try to enchant their dates, or a combination
thereof, Aside from that, who would dare leave his automobile
in the boondocks completely unprotected ?

Third on the list of new parking facilities is the area adja-
cent to the Library and Old Dorms, This region teems with
four-wheeled monsters from 7:30 a.m. until 11:00 p.m, Dorm
Counselors and their charges tend to have an established
monopoly in this region.

Finally, a fourth parking area is located below Doremus
Gymnasium near Route 60. The lot is not well used, and if
used, entails a grand uphill trek in order to reach the campus.

Four new or improved parking areas exist. So what is the
problem ?

The answer to this question is complex. Coupled with the
appearance of these parking spots was the dramatic disappear-
ance of an almost unlimited parking haven, That haven was
the expansive acreage behind old Doremus Gymnasium, With
construction of the new gym this refuge was gobbled by the
new building. Also as a result of the construction, workers
had to park in places that students, faculty members and ad-
ministrators might have put to good use.

Another answer is that the number of students operating
cars has zoomed, Increased enrollment has meant more
vehicles. In addition the faculty approved two resolutions in
recent years that aggravated the crisis. The first was permit-
ting scholarship students to operate cars. The second was al-
lowing freshmen to also operate cars within Rockbridge
County. These limits had effectively held the automobile
population down, Freshmen, who must live on-campus, ob-
viously wish to have their vehicles close by .The result is that
the few parking places along Washington Street around the
Student Union are jammed with freshmen cars.

If the above situation was not miserable enough, the City
of Lexington compounded the quandary, “NO PARKING”
signs popped up on Washington Street opposite the Dutch
Inn. Then meters installed on Lee Avenue between
Washington Street and Preston Street,

Sounds bad? It will get worse. The area immediately in
front of Doremus will soon be converted into a plaza-type
space. So, kiss those few spaces goodbye.

With a majority of W&L students living off-campus, what
can they do? Many live in the country and must drive to and

were

from classes, as well as extracurricular activities. There often
is just nowhere to squeeze in a car near the campus, These
souls have few options but to park illegally and run the risks
of acquiring a ticket.

Last year W&L did not distribute parking stickers to men
who lived within a half mile of the university, This regula-
tion has faded away. Perhaps, it should be reincarnated.
However, it would simply constitute. a short-run, stopgap
solution.

The vital problem is this:
greatly outdistancing any growth in parking facilities. Stu
dents are spending too much time hunting for crevices for

the car population growth is

their cars. Plus, the faculty is increasing in numbers, yet its
parking domain remains constant in size, With the new law
school on the drawing boards, you can bet more student
lawyers soon will be attending W&L. More students mean
more cars. Already visitors and prospective students are un
able to even get near W&L, If over $3,000,000 can be coughed
up for a gym, why cannot just a bit more be produced so that
people can park their automobiles within a sane distance of
this institution ?

various areas and aspects of
Washington and Lee.

DAVID ROGER MUNSICK, JR.

Washington and Lee's students
are, in general, a diverse group.
There are few overriding generali-
zations that unite all of them. It
is perhaps fitting, then, that The
Ring-tum Phi series on aspects of
the University begins with one of
these seldom-found common  de-
nominators, Regardless of their cur-
rent academic standing, their social
mores, their political views, each
of Washington and Lee’s undergrad-
uates passed at one time through
the school’s admissions process.

Admissions at Washington and
Lee, as at other similar schools, is
a time-consuming, expensive, often
subjective phenomenon, one that
shapes the character of a student
body, and yet one that is prey to
national trends that extend far be-
yond the college campus.

According to James D. Farrar,
Director of Admissions, Washington

mittee is occupied by decisions on
borderline candidates, of whom
many may be qualified, but of
whom, due to size limitations, only
a relatively small number can be
selected,

Service on the committee is usu-
ally undertaken in three year terms.
Last year, student representation on
the committee on questions of over-
all policy, though not questions on
specific applications, was initiated
for the first time. Greg Wilson °72,
and Griff Steel ‘73 are this year’s
student representatives.

Successful applicants to the Uni-
versity will be notified on or about
March 25. They need not, how-
ever, reply until May 1. Unsuccess-
ful applicants receive word from
Washington and Lee by April 1. It
is during the spring period that the
rate of confirmations from those
accepted is watched carefully. A
predetermined number, (it will be
roughly 350 for the class that will
enter this September) of freshmen
has been established, and it must
be discerned if, to achieve that
figure, more acceptances should be
issued to men placed on the wait-

 

 

Director of Admissions, James D. Farrar, talks about the selection process,

and Lee may spend more than a
year in some form of contact with
a prospective applicant; a period
ranging from sometime during the
candidate's junior year in high
school until notification of accept
ance of rejection in the spring of
the senior year

Initial correspondence, then, for
individuals seeking to come to
Washington and Lee as freshmen in
the fall of 1973, will probably
begin next month. High school
juniors inquiring about the Univer
sity will receive return letters and
publications from the Admissions
Office. Files will be opened. Next
September, application forms will
be mailed to all those who have
expressed interest, By November |
completed applications are due from
those seeking an Early Decision

a decision on these applicants by
November 15, and confirmation of

cants is due by December |
(Last fall, seventy men, an all

time record, applied to Washington

and Lee under this program. Fifty
five of these candidates were ac
cepted.)

The greater bulk of WAL candi

dates, those applying under the

normal admissions procedure, must
submit their papers, (and the $10
applications fee) by February 15

selection of Washington and Lee
by more than an anticipated num-
ber of those accepted, can lead to
overcrowding and large class sizes,
(This was the case with the class
that entered the University in the
fall of 1970)

Thirteen men make up the ad-
missions committee, and it is clear
that each possesses his own ideas
about what factors are characteristic
of the best candidate for Wash-
ington and Lee. Some certain de-
nominators are required of all W&l

applicants, All must take the
Scholastic Aptitude Tests in the
verbal and quantitative fields, as

well as the English Composition
Test and at least two other Achieve-
ment Tests of their own choice
Also, while the varying qualities of
different secondary schools are
taken into consideration, all appli-
cants are required to take a certain
series of courses, made up of six
teen college preparatory units, In
addition these include
four units of English, three of
math, two in a foreign language,
and at one in a laboratory

At times one vexing problem,
and one of which both high school
college counselors and college ad-
missions officials are apparently
keenly aware, is the role of extra-
curricular activity in a candidate’s
consideration. Washington and Lee,
for the most part, appears to be
reluctant to accept men who, in
Dean Farrar’s words, “have been
unwilling to give of themselves and
contribute to their school.” At the
other extreme, the admissions com-
mittee must be on guard against
“professional extra-curriculars,” men
whose meticulously cited records
list a wide variety of highly super-
ficial endeavors,

The solution, or at least, the at-
tempted solution to this problem,
on the part of Washington and Lee,
is to seek the academically qualified
applicant, who has demonstrated an
in-depth interest in a relatively small
number of activities, a man who
shows some promise of continuing
such activities in colleges. In the

Washington and Lee admissions
situation, one’s participation — in
athletics is evaluated in a manner

similar to other activities, (drama,
debate, publications, music, art, etc.)
but Dean Farrar is quick to point
out that visits of coaches to dif-
ferent areas has been a real asset
in bringing Washington and Lee to

the attention of outstanding  stu-
dents, athletes and non-athletes
alike.

The role of alumni is yet another
factor to be considered in an indi-
vidual’s application. Consistently
placing high among initial contacts
for secondary school applicants
with Washington and Lee is the
reputation of alumni. Frequently,
graduates of the University submit
recommendations in behalf of candi-
dates. In recent years, more organiz-
ed activity in behalf of admissions
has been organized in five areas;
Atlanta, Chicago, the Tri-city reg-
ion in North Carolina, Philadelphia,
and Cleveland. Each area has an
alumni chairman who heads a group
of from eight to ten men in the
respective city. Under the program,
which is largely coordinated by
Dean William Schildt from Wash-
ington and Lee, the groups seek to
attract outstanding high school stu-
dents for Washington and Lee, to
interview personally as many area
applicants as possible, and to at-
tempt to contact the successful
applicants in order to urge them to
choose Washington and Lee. Balti-
more is now the sixth city involved
in this program,

A further influence of alumni
comes on the question of the admis-
sion of the sons of graduates called
“among the most sensitive of all
areas” by Dean Farrar. Sons of
Washington and Lee alumni are not
automatically accepted by the Uni-
versity, but they do receive special
considerations, Many general appli-
cants who are rejected by WAL are
in fact qualified to do the work in-
volved; they fail to be accepted
only because others, for a variety
of reasons, are considered to be
more qualified, Alumni sons, how-
ever, do not face this situation. They
are judged only on their own
ability to perform successfully at
Washington and Lee, If it is felt
that they can, they are accepted;
if not, they are rejected. They are
not confronted by what can be a
very intense general competition for
places in a WAL freshman class.

Last year, 85 alumni sons sought
admission to Washington and Lee
and 64, roughly 75% were accepted
This is in contrast to an acceptance
figure of about 64% for all other
applicants, The highest alumni son
acceptance ratio was 76% in 1967

admissions is a situation of
individuals and procedures, In the
final analysis, however, the picture
becomes one of cold hard figures
In order to fill the aforementioned
$80 spots in a freshman class, Wash-
ington and Lee generally must ac

tions rise each year, back up to
last year’s figure of 1260. Applica-
tions for this year, are, at this
writing running 5% ahead of last
year’s pace (1107 as compared to
1054 a year ago). Dean Farrar
attributes this continuing small rise
to two factors, the University’s
strong reputation in many areas of
academic life and Washington and
Lee’s long-standing desire to be a
national institution. (Although 20%
of W&L students come from Vir-
ginia, the school also draws heavily
from such areas as Texas, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and
Ohio.)

Nonetheless, Washington and Lee
has felt the financial trends domi-
nant in the nation, Confronted with
the choice of sacrificing to attend
Washington and Lee, or living easily
at a larger, less expensive school,
an individual of moderate resources
will often choose the latter al-
ternative if he receives two ac-
ceptances. Worse yet, he may not
apply to Washington and Lee at
all, and the pool of applicants is
thus reduced. The loss of such stu-
dents, in both ways, is reflected in
admission statistics, 66% of all ap-
plicants had to be accepted to fill an
eventual enrollment of 356 a year
ago. While the average W&L fresh-
man continues to be ranked in the
top 19% of his secondary school
class, average SAT scrores stood at
575 (verbal) and 615 (math), a very
slight rise from the year before.

Even more striking is the effect
of the financial plight on the whole
question of financial aid. Up to
1969, every successful applicant who
demonstrated the need was offered
the necessary assistance to attend
W&L. But this past year, due to
the fiscal situation, that number
shrank to 140 of 176 such appli-
cants, (Still a high figure for a
liberal arts college of this size.)
But students that Washington and
Lee wanted; individuals who may
well have wanted Washington and
Lee, went elsewhere as a result.

The situation is also made ap
parent in an examination of applica-
tions from underprivileged students.
In 1970, 38 such applications were
received, 26 were admitted, and
17 enrolled. Last year, there were
34 applications, 19 were offered
acceptance, but only 6 enrolled, in
part at least, because of the fi-
nancial aid situation,

It is difficult then to evaluate the
overall state of admissions at Wash-
ington and Lee. No one questions
that improvement is desired; few
can fail to see that some improve-
ment is being made on what is
already a solid foundation, Financial
limitations are indeed regrettable,
but they are part of a national
situation, one that Washington and
Lee certainly cannot solve by it
self, one that it has still resisted
through outstanding personnel and

a continuing sense of institutional
purpose, The great coeducation
question that confronts the Uni

versity certainly would have effects
on admissions, but there appear to
be highly varied opinions on how
much such a move would lend to
the academic excellence of WAI
applicants,

There is, however, one resource
that can be employed immediately
to aid the overall admissions picture;
one way that the present makeup
of the school can improve that pool
of applicants, and can influence
more of those who have been ac
cepted here to make Washington
and Lee their school, This is through
the use of Washington and Lee's
students, One such program already
exists of course; the Student Re
cruitment Committee has succeeded

More Letters On Coeducation

Group Urges Change

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

| composed this letter with a
zest, an assurance, and a hope that
has been vacant from my life here
in Lexington. Until recently, it was
assumed by (most) students that
W&L was, structurely, something
that was just lived with. With the
birth of an active interest in co-
education, the students may have
awakened from a long slumber.
Apathy is slowly being put off; put
away. W&L is again alive.

The group | am representing is
not only offering a way of con-
tinuing this rarity of commitment,
it is offering a tremendous transi-
tion for W&L living. It is offering
(hopefully) a sexually and racially
more equal place to live. It is hop-
ing to alter the barriers that now
forbid girls from attending this
school,

As a group we are actively press-
ing for this change. We were at the
E.C, meeting this past Monday, we
will be at the next U.C. meeting
on coeducation, and we have met
(hopefully by the time you read
this) with President Huntley. We
were present when the U.C, decided
to put a coeducation referendum on
the upcoming election ballots.

We (THE STUDENTS FOR CO-
EDUCATION) are seeking to make
Washington and Lee a better school
and a better place to live. When I
say this, ideas of equality and fair-
ness, and of a healthy, normal life

 

 

By MARC JAMES SMALL

The President's proposed eight-
point peace plan may well have
been an effective ploy to quiet the
dovish opposition to the Vietnam
War, yet how effective will it be in
the settlement of the conflagration
in Southeast Asia? May the Presi-
dent not quite possibly have sacri-
ficed the lives and effort of the
American nation in return for short-
term political gain?

The most disquieting aspect of
the peace plan is the possibility of
a coalition government. Coalition
governments have been tried in
many areas of the world since
World War Il, yet they have been
notoriously unstable and have, with
the exception of Austria, fallen
through internal subversion to the
Communists.

Due to the divided loyalties of
Communist agents operating in such
a political establishment, the coali-
tion government eventually becomes
a system in which one portion of
the structure operates for the good
of the state while another portion
operates for the advancement of
one political party; with the out-
side resources the Communists are
able to call on, at the proper time
a coup d'etat becomes a certain
success for them, Considering the
extremely unstable situation in Viet-
nam, a coalition government would
be the worst possible means of re-
storing peace, prosperity, and indi-
vidual liberty to this nation,

Another disturbing aspect of the

Students for Coeducation

Consider Alumnae Gifts

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Coeducation, which promises to
be an issue for the next few years,
should be looked at rationally in-
stead of emotionally, In other words,
despite the fact that it would be
very nice to have girls around, the
advantages of coeducation must
outweigh the disadvantages in order
to justify such sweeping change in
this institution,

The pro-coed arguments do not
convince me that the advantages
outweigh the drawbacks of coedu-
cation for several reasons.

First, Washington and Lee offers
a choice that fewer and fewer col-
leges are offering—the choice to at-
tend an all-male school. Probably
becattse WAL offers this option, ap-
plications to W&L were up last year
while many other schools suffered a
decrease in applications,

Somehow, it is comforting to
know that students come here pri-
marily to get an education, not to
look for a marriage partner or use

clause. Victorious nations do not
pay reparations to defeated op-
ponents; while a political compro-
mise may well present a settlement
in Vietnam, complete American sur-
render appears slightly out of line
with the utter failure of the Com-
munists to win a military victory.
We should be in a strong bargain-
ing position at the peace talks, yet
our proposals have all the familiar
stamp of defeat,

We did not send in the Marines
so the Communists would have
prisoners to treat as hostages.
Rather, we entered the Vietnam con-
flict with vague yet tangible goals;
if we still have these same goals,
then this is not the time for col-
lapse, while, if we have changed
our goals, then a complete revision
of our Vietnam policy is in order.
It is not compatible with our policies
to the present in Vietnam for us
to seriously propose such a contro-
dictory and discordant plan as the
President has suggested.

It appears that the Communist
forces will not accept this program.
This rejection would be a definite
mistake on their part, for it is
difficult to envision another plan
so tractable to their interests while
failing so miserably to safeguard
those goals that so many Americans
have given so much to achieve.

Who Is Actually Hurt By Busing?

By JOHNNY E. MORRISON

Much concern and upheaval has
come about because of busing. |
believe that anybody who really
understands what busing is knows
that not the Whites but the Blacks
are the victims of desegregation.
Maybe the Nixon Administration
and the local school authorities feel
that if “they—Blacks—want inter-
gration then let them pay for it.”

The Supreme Court’s decision to
alleviate the dual school system is
now running into a major conflict
with Mr, Nixon's Southern Strategy.
Mr. Nixon and his Administration
continue to sweet talk us mis-led
Southerners with a piece of pepper-
mint candy in the form of a “hands
off policy” toward busing. This at-
titude of the Administration is
reminiscent of the former Republi-
can President Hayes who withdrew
federal troops from the south, gas-
sing the enforcement of federal laws
to protect the Black minority.
Whereas The Department of Health,
Education and Welfare withhold
funds from some Southern districts,
it only passes the funds to a more
reluctant Justice Department who
distributes it to others who promise
they will comply with the law.

When Elliot Richardson announc-
ed that all but 76 of the South's
2,700 school districts were integrat-
ed, he used a criteria for desegrega-
tion which is very deceiving. His
remarks that 90.5 per cent of
Blacks and Whites in the south at-
tend schools in “unitary” systems
are also deceiving. He uses the
terms desegregation and unitary in

a functional manner. Its task is to
function in such a way with figures
and numbers and not cold facts,
The way the Administration is
counting students is the same way
a conductor would count the train
car and not the passengers. It is
possible that the train cars could be
mixed—even if only three out of
eighty passengers in only two of
the 100 cars were Black. If one
looks at the quantitative aspects of
HEW's figures and the real figures
he will find a great flaw. Must we
remind the Administration that the
integration movement must not be
weighed on qualitative aspects only
but also on quantitative aspects.

When the General Accounting
Office (an investigating arm of Con-
gress) charged that $75 million in
emergency funds appropriated to
facilitate integration had been mis-
used, the Administration's desire to

buy Southern votes was seen. Jack-
son, Mississippi was allocated $.3
million for desegregation before it
filed it’s application for funds. It
was also discovered that Talladega
County, Ala. received $168,247
after telling HEW that there was
no discrimination against Black
teachers. The Administration always
investigates; why did not they in-
vestigate that lie? Since President
Nixon had personally ordered “to
get that money out there,” maybe.

HEW's goal was to do just that
with any means possible. Some of
these desegregation projects follow
racist overtones—that Blacks have
special defects in behavioral pat-
terns, that Blacks are best suited for
menial jobs and most have very
poor hygiene. Some of the projects
have very little to do with de-
segregation and are very irrelevant
to bringing the two races together.
Instead of making harmony these
projects sometimes make a conflict
a derivative,

In the long run some of these
funds may help the South resist
desegregation. (The Southern leaders
should tell the Administration to go
and play politics in the North).
Whites think that they are being
affected by busing and desegrega-
tion. | ask them this question, “What
schools are being closed—Blacks’ or
Whites’?” Yes, Black schools are
transformed into vocational centers,
warehouses and administration
buildings. Then the white schools
are enlarged to accomodate the in-
coming Blacks. The Blacks are the
ones who have been taking long
bus rides for years, The Blacks are
the ones who have to see the only
landmark in town which they can

How does two-platoon baseball
grab you? Rather than one set of
nine ballplayers, why not use eigh-
teen? In the field your pitchers and
eight others are your best de-
fensive players; at bat, you em-
ploy the nine best hitters. Crazy,
huh? Yes, but in a time when base-
ball is gradually losing its hold on
the American public, such an in-
innovation would do the game more
than a litthe good, And if baseball
Coach Joe Lyles has his way, W&L
may play a couple of games to
practice the idea.

Oh, it’s been tried in the past,
but without success, largely because
the public was enthralled with the
old style. But now, people are los-
ing interest in baseball and are
turning to other sports such as
football and basketball. Why that

sociological study; but from: my way
of thinking, twoplatoon baseball
may do more than provide a design
to spur lagging interest. More im-
portantly, it would create an op-
portunity for more people to play.
Baseball suffers from a one-way
substitution rule; once a player is
taken out, he cannot return. Thus
a coach is often reluctant to take
a starter out, for fear that he may
by weakening the over-all line-up
by replacing him with a_ second
string «perfermer. None of these
other sports face this problem. Stu-
dents going out for the team, par-
ticularly freshmen and sophomores,
see only a carer of bench warming,
and soon decide to bag it. This is
particularly true at the larger uni-
versities but is equally adaptable to
smaller institutions like W&L.

Secondly, baseball is a sport
which does not rely as heavily on
specialization as other sports. In
football, a flanker must be fast and
able to catch a pass, and a tackle
must be able to move someout out.
But in baseball, a player must be
able to hit, run, throw, and field
with equal ability or he is on the
bench,

Sure, you can change the -sub-
stitution rule, but that would mean
playing time for only a few more
participants. With an eighteen man

game is all about. A close look at
the W&L student body would reveal
that there are a number of potential

Generals Defeat Hopkins, Rhode Island, Bridgewater;
Emory & Henry Here Saturday

Record Now 10-5;

By PALMER TRICE

Besides winning three of four
games last week, Coach Canfield
learned something about scheduling.
You don’t play four games in a
week, It is too hard on your ball
players. That was the excuse for
the solitary W&L loss. “We just
ran out of gas,” said General Hoop
Coach Verne Canfield. “Loyola had
a good ball club.”

Last Tuesday night, the Generals
started off their big week, at home,
with Johns Hopkins. The visitors
had won but one game before their
appearance at Doremus, The Blue

outrebounded, outhustled, and out-
scored their opponents, and came
away with a 93-65 victory. It was
an auspicious beginning for the
Generals. Mike Daniel, as usual,
led the home squad with 23 points
and 10 rebounds, Skip Lichtfuss
added 19 points and 10 rebounds,
Doug Clelan, whose game has re-
cently taken an upsurge, tossed in
13 points, and added 9 big assists.
The Generals played good ball, but
still did not reach their potential.

Friday night brought one of the
the
opposition

biggest crowds of
Doremus. The

year to
was to

be provided by the Anchormen of
Rhode Island, who sported a 9-3
record, and an All-American named
Bo Wilson, Wilson carried a 26
point average into this game with
the Generals.

“Rhode Island is certainly one of

the toughest teams that we will
play,” said Coach Canfield before
the contest. He was right. After

viewing the pre-game warm-up, one
wondered if the Generals had a

chance. Rhode Island, who started
a 6-9, 6-8, 6-3 backcourt, was
taller and, perhaps a little quicker

than the home team. But, for the

first time this year, at home; the
Generals seemed to have that honed
edge of excellence. The Blue were
a fired up ballclub Friday night,
and nobody was going to -beat
them.

From the opening tap, there was
no doubt that this was to be a
fiercely contested ball game. The
Blue opened a quick 6-0 lead, but
were not able to pull away. With
7:13 left in the half, the Anchor-
men pulled up to even, at 26
apiece. The score was tied again
at 30, and then the Blue pulled
away to a 43-40 halftime lead.

The Generals, who played tough
defense throughout the game, con-
tinually came up with the big
basket. Mike Daniel led the hoop-
ers with 15 points, while Rhode
Island was paced by 6-8 Co-captain
Karl Augenstein, who had bagged
8 of 9 shots from the field, for 16
points. The Warwick, R.I. senior
hit his shots from anywhere and
everywhere,

Rhode Island came out in a man
for man defense, and quickly pulled
within one. But the Generals ran
and ran, and managed to stay at
least even, or better. Their greatest
lead was six points, at 59-53, From
there out, the game got progressively
tighter. Both teams were hitting the
boards and shooting well.

With 3:27 left in the game, Karl
Augenstein tied the score at 80.
At the 2:15 mark, Mike Daniel put
the Blue up by two, on two foul
shots, Augenstein’s lay-up at the
1:17 mark tied the score. The Gen-
erals missed their attempt, and with
‘50 seconds left, the Anchormen
called time out. Then they proceed-
ed to run the clock down to :15

seconds, and called another time
out. With about four seconds re-
maining, Rhode Island tried to

whip the ball underneath to Augen-
stein, and an alert Blue defense
intercepted the pass. The buzzer
went off, and the Generals went
into overtime.

The Anchormen scored first on
two foul shots, but Mike Daniel
tied the game at 84 apiece, with
3:43 remaining in the five minute
overtime period, With 1:25 remain-
ing, Doug Clelan put the Generals
in front on two foul shots. With
eleven seconds left in the period,
Skip Lichtfuss sank two more free

throws, which nullified Augenstein’s
two points at the :07 second mark.
This was perhaps the greatest Gen-
erals victory in the last two years.
The 88-86 triumph was a classic in
team play and hustle. Coach Can-
field went to his bench less than
usual, but then he had no reason.
Mike Daniel had 33 points, and
Skip Lichtfuss garnered 21, But the
star of the game was big Karl
Augenstein, who had 35 points, on
16 of 21 from the field, and found
time to haul down 11 rebounds.

In spite of the fact that Rhode
Island outrebounded us and shot a
better percentage, the Generals made
up for it in hustle and big plays.
This was their finest hour,

On Saturday night, the W&L
Hoopers finally ran out of gas.
They fell behind early to a tough
Baltimore Loyola team. The Gen-

erals came back, but ran out of
steam in the stretch. They were
tired, and emotionally exhausted.

They were also playing on hostile
territory, and that did not help.
The Blue shot only 37%, compared
to the Greyhounds 48%. They were
also. outbounded, and outhustled.
The final 71-62 margin was dis-
appointing, but not unexpected, con-
sidering the physical and _ psycho-
logical condition of the team, and
the caliber of the opponents.

wants to go to a coed school has
more than enough opportunity.
Also a long term must be
taken about alumni donations, Since
this school depends a great deal on
alumni help, a study should be
made as to whether future alumnac
would give as much help as alumni
Perhaps one could study the alum
nae aid of Hollins and Mary Bald
win and see whether it compares
favorably with our alumni gifts.
My tentative guess is that alumnac
would not give us as much as our
alumni because most girls get mar
ried and often forfeit a job which
would enable them to more easily
donate gifts to their alma matet
Coeducation advocates often at
eve that WAL is an elitist institu
tion because there are no girls here
This is wrong. Washington and Lee

it is all-male, but because of its aca-
demic excellence. Harvard, Yale and

bring us down to the level of “non-

If we look at HEW’s figures

Now we see segregation within the

the desegregated schools have been
left out of the mainstream of the
school, They must sit back and
listen to “Dixie,” witness the wav-
ing of the Confederate flag at half

usually is “Rebel.” I wonder how
the Whites would feel if they had

When the Black students protest ot

are fired for insubordination. The
