University Council Says
Housemothers Optional

The Interfraternity Council's pro-
posal to render the employment of
housemothers optional for W&L
fraternity houses, effective Septem-
ber 1972, finally passed last Thurs-
day when the University Council
held their regular monthly session.
In addition there was considerable
discussion about student parking
problems.

The University Council's decision
on the housemother proposal is
contingent on the IFC's presenting
next month a satisfactory plan for
phasing out housemothers and giv-
ing proper notice to those who
might be affeoted.

“We are very pleased with the
vote,” said IFC President Bob La-
Rue, “However, there won't be any
rush to dump housemothers. Many
houses have already expressed the

Souvenirs Taken From
Lee Chapel Museum
After SABU Concert

BY PAUL LANCASTER
Over $182 worth of souvenirs
were taken from the Lee Chapel
museum fast Thursday night
Most of the items were of little

spoons, and other souvenirs—made

The theft apparently occurred
Thursday night during or after a
concert put on by a group of Roa
noke school children as part of
SABU's Black Culture week activi
ties, “The kids had supervi

With University President R. E. R.
Huntley and Student Body President
Steve Robinson presiding, the Coun-
cil debated the IFC Housemother
proposal for nearly one and a half
hours. The proposal, which had
been defeated by the Student Affairs
Committee several weeks ago, was
re-introduced before the UC by
IFC President Robert LaRue and
IFC Senior Justice Joe Garten.

LaRue and Garten argued that
many fraternity housemothers really
have no real duties, and therefore
present an unnecessary burden on
many houses. It was emphasized
that some houses now may be in
precarious position financially, and
that any possible economizing may
become quite necessary

Defending SAC'’s denial of the
proposal, Student Control Commit-
tee Head Rob Turnbull and SAC
member Dr. Tom Imeson maintain
ed that the IFC's reasons were not

sufficiently compelling to lift the
university requirement for house
mothers, In addition, they argued
housemothers were often a needed

“civilizine” influence in a house
whose behavior may tend to get out

over the IFC

W@&L: Where It Has Been, Where It Is Going ==

Administration Viewed As A Personalized Force

BY ANDREW G. SIMPSON, JR.

The following article is meant to
provide a study of the “they” of
Washington and Lee, “They” con-
sists of the people and organization
responsible for University policy.
“They” guides and directs the uni-
versity. “They” gets credit when
things go right on a University-wide
scale. “They” also gets blamed when
things go wrong. “They” is the Ad-
ministration,

Organization is a vital element in
determining the effectiveness of any
governing body. Yet, “they,” better
refers to the Washington and Lee
establishment than does the term
“administration” because it implies
personalization, This study — will
hopefully go beyond what a mere
organizational diagram would pro-
vide because the Washington and
Lee administration is not so much a
structure or organization as it is a
personal, human force.

There are three academic deans
within the administration: the dean
of the College; the dean of the
School of Commerce, Economics,
and Politics; and the dean of the
Law School: The latter is concerned
with graduate study; the two former,
undergraduate,

emphasize in discussing his role as
an administrator that, “Although I
am Dean of a particular School, |
am more a part of Washington and
Lee University than of the indivi-
dual School.” This outlook is a
shared one among administrators.
Decisions are made with the good
of the University as a whole in
mind. Within his own School, Dean
Atwood notes, “Everything is aimed
at the best possible undergraduate
edueation—all programs and peo-
ple—and anything that does not aim
in that direction just doesn’t fit
here.”

Dean Atwood is alone “at the
top” in the School of Commerce,
Economies, and Politics. There is
no Assistant Dean, as such, But the
School is not run by Dean Atwood
alone. Four departments of Ac-
counting, Economics, Politics, and
Administration with appropriate
faculty and department heads con-
stitute the School along with Dean
Atwood. The set-up works well for
the Dean. Much of his time is spent
at innumerable, but necessary com-
mittee meetings with his own de-
partment heads and other admini-
strators. Such communication ses-
sions bring problems and solutions
to the surface. Curriculum changes,
degree requirement modifications,
and a new emphasis on computer

Mareh 8, 1972

Have you ever attempted to cash a check or even pay a bill
with a check in Charlottesville, or any other large university
town? The result is appalling. You are treated somewhat like
a criminal. Identification, addresses and telephone numbers

must be presented.

A\ similar rigmarole may not be far off in the future for
WA&L men in Lexington. Current student checks are bouncing
at an alarming pace, and as a result instilling well-founded
concern in the minds of community entrepreneurs.

The existing situation is markedly gloomy. So far this aca-
demic vear between $800 and $900 worth of bad checks have
heen written, Over 400 students, one quarter of the student
hody, have erred in figuring out bank balances, either inten-

tionally or otherwise.

Albeit these difficulties exist, Washington and Lee is for-
tunate to have a group—the Student Financial Relations Com-
mittee, perhaps bettet known and better described as the
Cold Check Committee—-with the goal of easing this predica-
ment. Actually the committee has a threefold purpose:

1. to handle unpaid accounts accrued by students with

local merchants,
}

ington businessmen,

2. to collect bad checks on a regular basis from Lex-

3. to discipline students with fining power for delin-
queney in financial matters,

Khett Tucker, a committee member summarized, “We must

show the freshman class and all students that we are here

to help them, not simply to punish them. | can say that if our

committee did not exist, a lot more merchants would not ac-

cept checks.

Chuck Lee, chairman of the Student Financial Relations
Committee commented that the “local merchants work on a
low cash basis: they simply cannot afford to take a loss on a

bad check.”

That is the problem; what is the solution? In rudimentary,
candy-covered terms W&L students must protect this check-
cashing privilege by covering their checks, Merchants cannot
accept the loss, but more importantly neither can the stu-
dent body. Remember that “gentlemen” who whip out their
checkhooks and scribble bogus checks are overlooking their
deep responsibility to fellow students,

Concerning the Student Body Elections, the Ring-tum
Phi wishes to extend credit where credit is due. Congratula-
tions to Bob Brennan, President-elect of the Student Body ;
Lewis Powell, Seeretary-elect of the Student Body; “Door-
stop” Jones, President of Faney Dress 1973; John Conrad,
new President of the Interfraternity Council; and John Fol-
sum, the new Vice President of the same body, Each gentle-
man has the potential to transfuse new ideas into student
yvovernment and student activities.

Yet, the question which caused the maximum student

response was, “Do vou believe that coeducation is desirable

for Washington and Lee?”
38 voted ves

\ total of 535 students voted no,
More students voted on this issue than voted
for candidates for any political office,

\pparently, students

feel pretty deeply about coeducation, And equally apparent is
that recent agitation for coeducation at Washington and Lee
has been largely dispelled by so-called conservative, apathetic,
old-fashioned reactionaries. Thank heavens for the conserva

tive, apathetic, old-fashioned reactionaries! It is encouraging
tw survey the students and conelucde that the Ring-tum Phi
does not solitarily oppose regularly enrolled women in the
undergraduate school, As was printed before, credit is ex-

iended where credit is due

J.W.R

application in courses are examples
of the types of academic matter con-
sidered at such meetings:

Even the most recent and big-
gest problem for the School, that
being lack of adequate space, has
found a solution in the young $56-
million building program announc-
ed by the University recently. Pres-
ently the School is “jammed in its
facilities’ in Newcomb Hall. With
the new building plans, the Scheol
will be moved into a renovated Mc-
Cormick building, a move which
Dean Atwood enthusiastically sup-
ports not only because it means ade-
quate space, but because “it will
keep us on the main campus, which
is very important becatise we are
an integral part of the undergradu-
ate program.” This building prob-
lem can be taken as one example of
the types of problems handled by
the administration, and Dean At-
wood’s office in particular.

Department heads are generally
referred to as faculty members and
not as administrators despite the
fact that their duties do involve
some administrative work. They
and the Dean share responsibilities
for academic counselling of  stu-
dents (as do individual faculty mem-
bers, as well) and work closely with
the Dean in making improvements
in the academic program of the
School. Dean Atwood sees no need
now for any enlargement of his
staff. Of his own particular job as
Dean, he says, “I feel | can perform
without assistance at this time.” The
smallness of the University as a
whole and of his School specifically
(it is the smallest school in the
American Association of Collegiate
Schools of Business) aceount for the
adequacy of the present administra-
tive organization within the School,
along with the acknowledged com-
petence of the staff.

The basic functions of the Dean
of the College, William J. Watt,
Ph.D., correspond to those of the
Dean of the School of Commerce,
Economies, and Politics. Similarly,
his unit of responsibility is within
academic aspects of the University
and not in non-academic affairs.
However, his area of responsibility
is much larger in terms of number
of students, faculty members, de-
partments, and department heads
than is that of Dean Atwood. In
addition, the Office of the Registrar
falls under Dean Watt's office. Of-
ficially, the Dean of the College is
the second ranking officer in the ad-
ministration and acts in the presi-
dent's place in the event of the lat-
ters absence.

It is to be expected then that the
Dean of the College have some as-
sistance, and he does in the position
of Assistant Dear of the College,
which is filled by Robert W. Me-
Ahbren, Ph.D. “Assistant Dean Me-
Ahren and | switch around on some
occasions, but the general roles stay
the same,” explains Dean Watt.
Certain aspects of this office's sche-
dule allow for modification so that
at least one of the Deans should be
on hand at all times. The Dean has
the responsibility of proposing, ex-
plaining. implementing, and direct-
ing the policy of the College. He
works closely with the heads ef each
department and with the other ad-
ministrators as must all the Deans
of the University,

His work involves interviewing
and evaluating prospective em-
ployees of the College; evaluating
the present curriculum, exchange
program, and degree requirements;
writing various recommendations;
and providing academic counselling
for students. Much time is spent on
formal committee work, but also
there is an emphasis on informal
contacts with faculty, students, and
other Deans. A characteristic of
this office is the constant procession
of students and faculty members
who enter seeking advice and in-
formation,

While Dean Atwood, Dean Me-
Ahren, Dean Watt (and Dean Stein-
heimer at the graduate school) are
concerned with academic matters,
the Dean of Students is left to han-
die non-academic affairs. As Lewis
G. John, Dean of Students, him-
self describes it: “My responsibili-
ties run the gamut from student or-
ganizations to individual counselling
and, too, to student discipline
through the Student Affairs Com-
mittee.” Reporting directly to Dean
John’s office are the Office of Ad-
missions, Office of Financial Aid,
the Chaplain's Office, the Infirmary,
and the new Office of Coordinator
of the Freshman Year

The Dean of Students has per-
haps the wildest area of concentra.
tion because of its non-academic na-
ture. He has to be thinking in a
number of directions simultaneous-
ly. Whereas, a phone call to an of.
fice of one of the academic deans
would concern more definite mat

ters; a ring on Dean John’s line
could concern an Honor Code vio-
lation, a student misconduct case at
a local girls’ school, a complaint
against a fraternity, a dormitory
counsellor’s problem, a question on
admissions procedure, news on
school loans or scholarships—or
just about anything else a student
could conceivably be involved with
outside of actual classroom work,

Keeping up with such matters
would seem an impossible — task.
However, the administrative officers
of the offices named above bring
order to the confusion of affairs,
Additional administrative officers do
not seem necessary here. Although
the Coordinator of the Freshman
Year has-been. “very helpful” ac-
cording to Dean John, it is believed
that too many more officers would
only add confusion. The present
structure “maintains the necessary
degree of structural flexibility” he
believes, and also maintains a high
degree of personalization, or direct
involvement by those in charge,

The entire administration of
Washington and Lee ean be char-
acterized as young in age. Perhaps
more than any other unit in the
administration, the Office of the
Dean of Students and the related
offices. display this characteristic.
This youthful atmosphere is con-
sidered especially important in deal-
ing direetly with student personnel,
with social behavior questions, and
with other young personalities as
the Dean of Students does.

The Student Affairs Committee,
the Executive Committee, the Stu-
dent Control Committee, the Uni-
versity Council and the Interfrater-
nity Council are the organizations
through which student opinion on
non-acadentic matters is formally
voiced. These organizations fall un-
der Dean John’s office. He considers
student opinion “necessary and very
valuable” for effective functioning
in the University. In fact more
involvement by students is sought
“to help beef up the admissions pro-
gram” and to help increase student
financial aid funds. The Student Re-
cruitment Committee works with the
Admissions Office in the Univer-
sity’s attempt to realize those goals,

It is in the area of academic affairs
where student control seems less
effective than in non-academic af-
fairs. The University Council is de-
signed to give students increased in-
volvement on all matters concerning
students. More directly, the Curri-
culum Committee exists to offer
constructive criticism and sugges-
tions. Student opinion is not without
representation at Board of Trustee
meetings either. The president of
the student body is invited to the
Fall. and. Spring meetings of the
Board, and the president-elect ac-
companies him at the latter.

However, actual student voting
power is neither desirable nor neces-
sary in the opinion of administra-
tors, As Dean Watt sees it, “Stu-
dents are people, like the trustees
and have the same feelings.” It is
believed that things really would
not change that much if students
were given voting power anyway.
Most important in this issue is the
fact that powers of ultimate auth-
ority and responsibility are invested
in the Board of Trustees. The Board
has to be careful as to the extent to
which it delegates authority like
student self-government because, in
the end, it is the Board and not the
students who are held responsibile
for University actions.

As the students’ authority and
respousibility is limited in many as-
pecis, so, too, is the University’s,
Just where the University acts in
a loco parentis capacity is a difficult
question to answer, Just where does
Washington and Lee draw the lines?
According to President Huniley,
the University tries not to act in a
loco parentis capacity to any greai
extent. First of all, the Latin, legal
term bothers President Huntley as,
in his words, “it implies that the
choice is between nothing and par-
ental influence. We cannot be tot-
ally unconcerned about the non-
classroom activities, but we do not
ry to get students to conform to a
predetermined patiern of ours, There
are some who make life chaotic for
the rest and we can't ignore them,
but anything the University does
needs to be tied to its basic function.
Our impact should be through ex.
ample and precept. The values of
Washingion and Lee are shared
values. values of self-respect and
respect for others, You cannot en-
force Vague concepts.”

It appears that the methods of
example and a continuing effort to
foster respect for the Honor System
prove most effective. There is a pre-
ventative rather than punitive em-
phasis. The result has been mini
mal action in a loco parentis capa
ely on the part of the University.

Yet.to be considered is the highly
visible office of the chief executive
of the University, The President of
the University is flanked by a Treas-
urer who is responsible for budget
formulation and control and direc-
tion of all business and develop-
ment services (e.g. University Serv-
ices, Building and Grounds, Data
Processing, University Development,
and Financial Services) and also a
Legal Advisor, Such advisors help,
but cannot greatly reduce the vast
number of responsibilities and duties
of the president,

To say that the president is elect-
ed by the Board of Trustees (of
which he is an ex officio member)
and acts to communicate between
the trustees and the campus leaves
a lot unsaid as to the nature of his
job. President Huntley recognizes
the fact that actually one “could
make a full-time job of any aspect
of his job—but that is not neces-
sary.” The President, above all else,
cannot escape being the principal
spokesman for the University on or
off campus. The President gets the
problems that do not find solutions
any place else.

In his capacity as spokesman off-
campus, the president is expected to,
and does, make numerous trips to
associations and other schools, meets
with executives of other institutions,
makes speeches to various acade-
mic groups, gathers with alumni—
and performs these and other func-
tions with appropriate business, aca-
demic, and social attitudes depend-
ing upon the situation, At all times,
he is conscious of the fact that what
he says and does will reflect upon
the University.

On campus, his activities are like-
wise varied and numerous. There
was a time when President Huntley
made the effort to attend every
social function on campus, but now
that is deemed unnecessary. He at-
tends such functions when he desires
and is able. A typical day on cam-
pus means a full schedule for the
president. He admits, “Everything
has to be compromised. I cannot
operate a completely open-door
policy. I try to get to see people by
appointment.” Appointments are
had with alumni, students, faculty
members, and campus visitors, He
has an average of two to three ap-
pointments with students every day
on campus. His lunch time is often
a working affair where he meets and
discusses matters with Deans, the
Treasurer, the Librarian and others.

Spontaneous phone calls, whether
they be from alumni, possibly legis-
lators, administrators from other in-
stitutions, or arriving spokesmen
must be answered. In addition, the
president manages to conduct a
seminar in the Law School. There
was a time when he taught some
regular classes, but that is no longer
feasible.

Naturally, his job necessitates
close cooperation with the Board of
Trustees on all matters—develop-
ment, planning, investment, budget,
and finances. It entails his keeping
the Boatd apprised of University
activities and his keeping himself ap-
prised of the Board's activities,

The president is required to act
on seemingly infinite occasions,
playing roles of both initiator and
reactor. “There is no way the Presi-
dent has time to do everything”, ad-
mits President Huntley, but this is
viewed as inherent in the nature of
the position, Added assistants or a
change in administrative structure at
this time is no cure for this situa-
tion. Instead, emphasis has been
placed on maintaining well-estab-
lished working relationships. “It is
the nature of the University and
particular people and not so much
the actual organization that is im-
portant here,” believes President
Huntley.

In the present administrative per-
sonnel and advisors to the president,
“there is no frequent buckpassing;
our people do a very good job.”
This limits the number of “insol-
uble” problems that end up on the
president's desk considerably, Thus
there are no plans for modifications
in this arrangement which neverthe-
less keeps the president so busy, “li
is generally agreed that the system
works well for us, It is not awk.
ward.”

The alternative, of additional as
sistants like someone who would
deal with institutional research ex-
clusively, would mean “too much
insulation.” in President Huniley’s
view, This condition ef greater in-
sulation resulting from added of-
ficers is purely speculative, but does
seem reasonable speculation, A
more personal, open aimosphere is
supposedly more easily attainable
and, therefore, desirable at a small
school like Washington and Lee
than at a larger school. It seen
right then for the University to
guard against an increase in “insula

tion” whenever possible.

For many, the Board of Trustees
consists of nineteen unknowns, It
is a body physically removed from
the University most of the time,
But, its powers are very real, defin-
ite and permeative. The Board's
knowledge of the University com-
munity exceeds the community's
knowledge of it for the most part.

The size of the Board is a matter
for consideration. Presently at nine-
teen, there is the provision to aux-
ment it to a maximum of twenty-
one. The size of the Board is con-
sidered to be small enough to be
manageable, yet large enough to
provide diversity.

It matters little really how many
members are on the Board or what
diversity they provide if they do not
hold an active interest in the Uni-
versity. President Huntley is con-
vinced that the Board displays an
active interest in the University.
Dean Atwood comments, “In my
experience, this present Board is the
best board.” At the least, the Board
is the largest, most diverse, and, by
virtue of its unique decision to im-
plement a six year term member-
ship (which stipulates that trustees
are elected for a six year term, no
present or future trustee may serve
more than two terms, and that there
is mandatory retirement at the age
of seventy regardless of time served!
in place of the old voluntary retire-
ment plan, has demonstrated gen-
erous capacity for change within i's
own structure. That interest is high
among members who take their
positions seriously and not merely
in an honorific sense is best demon-
strated in the statistic that the last
time the Board failed to meet a
quorum was over four years ago.

The trustees have the ultimate
responsibility for providing leader-
ship, direction, and stability for the
University. The Board oversees every
facet of University progress—the
enrollment, faculty, facilities, and
financial resources. It is The gov-
erning board, It elects and can re-
move its own members, assigns du-
ties to all the administrative offcials
including those discussed above,
and elects a president who is chief
executive of the University.

Three formal meetings—one in
the Spring, Fall, and Winter are
held annually by the Board as a
whole. Much of the work in the in-
terim period is done by committees.
An evaluation in the 1964-66 Self
Study Report of the University stat-
ed, “It appears that compared to
governing boards of other private
institutions, the Board of Trustees
of Washington and Lee has pro-
vided effective and competent lead-
ership and is well organized to do
so in the decades ahead.” The Self-
Study Report was not without some
recommendations for even further
improving the Board, however.

lt is perhaps indicative of the
Board's active interest in the better-
ment of the institution that these
recommendations have been largely
implemented. An evaltative study
today would find, as that of 1964-
66 recommended, standing commit-
tees in areas such as development,
nominating, and finances and also a
continued policy of appointing
special commitiees to meet unusual
requirements,

In addition, there is a functioning
Executive Committee of the Board,
to which all reports on academics
are made first before being presented
to the whole Board at one of the
three annual meetings.

A primary responsibility of the
Board is that of fund-raising. Money
is raised with a heavy reliance upon
volunteers. The Board and the
President stimulate annual giving
by other volunteers, such as Pareni
Groups, Regional Groups. the State
Planning Council, and the Robert
E. Lee Associates, by their own pri-
mary examplcs of giving and will-
ingness to communicate to others,

There is a shared history of past
identification with the University
among adminisirators. All have
served the University in some capa-
city prior to their assuming their
present duties, They have not only
taught at the University at some
level in the past, but continue to do
so even while performing as Deans
Such associations foster, as Dean
John calls it, “institutional loyalty
and identification.” “It marks some
things easier and some things har
der” notes President Huntley, but
all in all it is considered a great as
sistance. The danger inherent in such
a situation is that a lack of fresh
ideas could develop, but the ad-
ministration believes it has avoided
this pitfall

There is an consensus among ad-
nunistraiors interviewed above that
the present internal structure and
communications work well, There is
a definite “personalized nature io

BY LEX McMILLAN

| read. Bob Ford’s letter in this
paper last week with a great mixture
of emotions. He raised some very
important questions concerning the
racial situation at Washington and
Lee which I feel should be care-
fully scrutinized. However, ‘there
are no easy answers to the ques-
tions. The solution of the racial
tension which is so undeniably pres-
ent here will not be easily found.
There is no easy solution; no one
action by one group will end. the
misunderstanding and __ ill-feelings
which exist between the Blacks and
Whites at W&L,

Though Mr. Ford’s letter was pri-
marily. concerned with the unen-
thusiastic response by the majority
of students to the First Annual
Black Culture Week, in a larger
sense his letter was a revealing re-
flection of the racial situation at
Washington and Lee.

He touches on a variety of re-
sponses to the ‘week’ which reflect
the variety of responses to the
Blacks at W&L. His first example
is of a racist response. It is a waste
of time to try and enlighten this sort
of individual, The malevolence and
hate which consumes the racist will
be his own reward, As he sows, so
shall he reap.

It is undeniable that there are
racists at W&L. I don’t know if we
have more than our fair share but it
is possible that a perverted under-
standing of our heritage and tradi-
tions serves to attract racists. This
is conjecture based on rather un-
scientific methodology. The point is
that we do have racists and there is
very little you can do with a firmly
convinced racist. They resist en-
lightenment with considerable ten-
acity, (Hate is a very powerful
force.)

Thus | will not concern myself
with this minority (hopefully) of
students. Rather I will address my-
self to the students whose opinions
fall somewhere between racism and
color-blindness. That is, the major-
ity of students; the mildly antagon-
istic, the indifferent and the bleed-
ing-hearts. Undoubtedly this is an
over simplification, but it repre-
sents a spectrum of racial attitudes,
which is the most realistic way to
view the situation.

Thus, just as | had ambivalent
feelings about Mr. Ford's letter, I
would say that most of W&L’s
White students’ racial opinions are
characterized by ambivalence. In
some cases the ambivalence turns
into indifference. Most White stu-
dents have no real antagonism for
the Black students, just as most have
no real dedication to racial har-
mony and understanding. Thus you
get indifference. | would say that
the indifference is an outgrowth of
ambivalence and the ambivalence a
result of uncertainty as to what
Blacks want,

Now obviously the way to dis-
cover what Blacks want is to par-
ticipate in such activities as were
offered by the Black Culture Week.
So why the poor response to this
“week”? | would say that in a sense
it was too late, Not irretrievably
late but late enough to receive an
indifferent response, But why in-
difference?

The Black Movement is old
enough to have acquired a rather
substantial history. In the course of
this history the ‘movement’ has gone
through several stages. At some

point in the struggle Whites. began
to see. the very real and. justifiable
complaints of American Blacks.

Thus, the Whites of America (not all

of them by any means) began to
gravitate toward the Blacks. Com-
munication and understanding were
hailed as means to solve the racial
problem. Integration began with the
idea of equality in terms of social,
economic and political rights and
opportunities,

The Whites who embraced integ-
ration eventually confronted a very
real shock and that is the apparent
desire of some Blacks to maintain a
cultural separatism. Thus many
Whites have experienced a certain
rejection which is hard to cope with,
They figured they'd just be human
to Blacks; treat them like you'd
treat anyone else. Then the shock-
ing realization comes that you can’t
treat them like anyone else. It is a
sort of culture shock. Mr. Ford's
use of the concepts of “Racial ident-
ity” and “Black Culture” underline
this separatism which has caused a
progression in once concerned
Whites from ambivalence to indiff-
erence.

It seems that many whites have
come to feel that whatever it is that
the Blacks want is utterly alien to
American culture. In other words,
the feeling has arisen that Blacks
want to maintain a cultural separ-
ateness to avoid becoming part of

Letters To The Editor...

The Motivation of Honor

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Mr. Small's column in the March
first edition of this paper proposed
that the key to salvaging Washing-
ton and Lee's Honor System is a
greater willingness on the part of
students to police other students.
Although such action would reduce
the amount of “lying, stealing and
cheating” I question whether such
a system could correctly be termed
an “honor system”. As Immanuel
Kant wrote in the 18th century,
“Can he be called virtuous, can he
be called honest, who would like to
yield to his favorite vices if only he
were not frightened by future pun-
ishment?”

Robert P. Beakley *72L

And what do we see, again, in the

or by anybody else.

Never mind, at the moment, the
fact that this “reference service” of-
fers to remove the remaining chal-
lenge before students who, in large
numbers, are already functionally il-
literate. Never mind too the fact
that one of the co-sponsoring or-
ganizations claims to be “a spec-
ialized agency of the United Na-
tions dedicated to peace,” which
brings up a whole new range of
questions.

“Your reference service is almost

‘Middle Class Dreams”

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Incredible. Absolutely astonishing.

It is 1972 and the consciousness of
the American college student has
supposedly changed. He is “sup-
posedly” more intelligent and “sup-
posedly” more aware of what is
really important in this thing called
life.

Yet I see the appalling figures
before me. For coeducation; 438
Against coeducation 535,

Now come off it fellas. Don't you
know yet that you have been depriv
ed of a really normal life here?
Haven't you even sensed it while
freezing your posterior on the way

back to Hollins Sunday afternoons?

I won't say a whole lot here. I'm
really a bit disgusted. A week from
now I'll undoubtedly pick up a Phi
and find myself “logically” disputed
by a student who got 1500 on his
college boards, but who's never used
his brain for anything more im-
portant.

I think one of my professors made
my point perfectly today. In speak-
ing about his students of just a few
years ago, he said that he’s always
interested in seeing that they all
bought the “Middle class dream.” In
connection with two cars, status,
$25,000 a year, three screaming
kids, and cocktail parties, he said,
“They all have gorgeous wives now

. and one on the side some-
where.”

In short, these W&L gentlemen,
at 30 and 40, are still “down the
road.” After all most of them never
knew anything else about girls, Ap-
parently we aren't going to either.

THE RING-TUM PHI

BY W. PATRICK HINELY

L certainly hope Richard Nixon
relaxed his old Joe McCarthy-ish
sense of anti-communism he has
had for so long while he was visit-
ing the People’s Republic of China.
“Red” China, by the way, is an ob-
solete term. It will be in vogue
again when the Chinese begin refer-
ring to our nation as the Imperialist
States of America.

Assuming Nixon did set aside his
prejudices while in China, he could
have learned a lot. The progress
made by Mao’s government since
1949 is astounding, though not read-
ily perceptible to Americans who
have been brainwashed against see-
ing any possible good in any type
of communism.

As I watched the President tour-
ing a “model” commune near Pe-
king last week, several of my fellow
tube boobs remarked, almost in
unison, as Nixon looked around a
“typical” family home: “Ha! They
don’t even have electricity or plumb-
ing. You call THAT progress???”

Yes. When you look back half a
century or even less and compare
the way things are NOW with the
way they were THEN, it is easy to
see how far the Chinese have pro-
gressed. Their housing is not yet up
to middle American standards, but
they don’t owe mortgages to anyone.
No longer do the Chinese people
live and slave for an aristocratic
master, knowing that their children
are doomed to a similar fate. In
China, such a form of repression
was part of the government. The
nobles filled the roles of local tax
collectors and magistrates and made
the law. In America, such robbing
functions have been quite capably
filled by private corporations, with
the government backing them up.

Of course, the Chinese govern-
ment now fills the role of lord and
master, and they have propagandiz-
ed the people. Mao’s little red book

fills the place of the Bible. The gov-
ernment imposes a constant sensory
bombardment upon the people. Here
in the U.S. advertising fills a similar
function. It is merely a difference in
who controls the pap fed to the
citizenry; here it is done by con-
sumer industries, there it is the
government. However, the U.S. gov-
ernment is now collaborating openly
with private industry by using
“slick” selling methods for armed
services recruiting. Today’s Action
Army wants to enjoin you.

While Nixon was in China, he
saw what great resources of man-
power can do. When he went to the
Great Wall, itself a monument to
what great manpower can do, he
had to travel miles of road which
had been snowed under the night
before. The Chinese didn’t clear
the road with plows; they probably
don’t have any. They do have plenty
of able-bodied men, so they called
out the Chinese equivalent of the
National Guard and gave them snow
shovels.
had the techno-
logy we have, they could progress
much farther and faster than we
ever will if we continue using our
present methods, They have the
manpower to go much faster, and
the method as well. Their system is
based on teamwork and coopera-
tion. They work WITH one another
to yield the most they can for every-
one. Here in our own paradisiac
hell, the competitive system pits one
man AGAINST another.

Ihe Chinese are even getting rid
of the concept of money. Workers
earn credit points instead of yen.
The points are used to obtain need-
ed goods, and when there are points
left over, wanted goods as well, re-
ferred to in the U.S. as “luxuries.”
Like in the Soviet Union, luxury
items are usually hard to find, but
in both nations, there will be more

the 1972 schedule. The Generals will

Stickmen Look Good In Scrimmage

BY BILL BALLARD

The springtike weather of last
week brought the upcoming lacrosse
season to the minds of several W&L
students. They recalled the pleasant
afternoons of last spring when
Washington and Lee rose to national
recognition as one of the nation’s
top teams, The outlook for the year
js just as bright.

About 30 players have been think-
ing about this season for a while
longer than the average student.
The defensemen and goalies have
been practicing since February |,
and the others have been working
out individually since February 21,
when practice officially began.

In helping prepare for the season,
the team scrimmaged Mount Wash-
ington Lacrosse Club, sort of the
Los Angeles Lakers of the lacrosse

world. Mount Washington usually
has players who were All-Ameri-
cans in college. The Saturday scrim-
mage showed that W&L has the
ability but needs a little more work.

Coach Dick Szlasa was a little
disappointed in the scrimmage, par-
ticularly the first half. He said that
“we are stronger than we showed in
the scrimmage.”

He added that “the first half was
theirs, but the second half was
ours.” This improvement toward the
end, eased some of the disappoint-
ment.

The scrimmage allowed Coach
Szlasa and Coach Bill McHenry to
try a few innovations and experi-
ment with a few players in different
positions. The game was video-tap-
ed and as a result, some plays have
been changed, Jim Farrar has been

placed on the defense, and Ed Tog-
netti has been put at midfield where
he had played before a temporary
switch to defense.

Coach Szlasa singled out the mid-
field of Ted Bauer. John Lalley and

Chip Tompkins and defenseman
Don Eavenson for their perfor-
mances Saturday. He also made

special notice of the four seniors on
the team. They have helped the
WAL go from rags to riches in la-
crosse. Team Co-Captain Scott
Neese was honorable mention All-
America, last year. Defenseman
fommy Smith has been an unher-
alded but consistently good player
for the past three years. At mid-
field, Jim “Piggy” McCane became
an outstanding player after having
played little in high school. And
the fourth, Chuck Robson, has pro-

vided leadership for the team while
backing up at goal.

Probably the two most impres-
sive members of the team are Sam
Engelhart and Skip Lichtfuss, Last
season, Engelhart was first team
All-American as a sophomore, while
Lichtfuss gained first team All-Divi-
sion as a freshman.

Depth and conditioning are the

keys to this year’s team. Coach
Szlasa expects to run three and
sometimes four midfields during

the season. He rates the midfields as
strong as any in the country. In ad-
dition, he anticipates using five de-
fensemen and attackmen almost in-
terchangeably.

With three games in four days,
this depth will be important, but
conditioning may make the differ-
ence. The outcome of the season
could hinge on someone receiving
or avoiding an injury.

This Saturday, the team journeys
to Colege Park, Md., to scrimmage
the University of Maryland. Mary-
land was runnerup to Cornell in the
national tournament, last year. Al-
though it is a scrimmage and will
not count for or against WAL’s rec-
ord, the team will prepare for it as
if it were a regular season game.
This scrimmage will be the last test
before the regular season; the Yale
session had to be called off because
of a conflict in Yale's schedule.

Solution for Racial Situation Suggested

(Continued from page 3)

the hodge-podge of American soc-
iety. Ostensibly they fear being
dominated by the White culture.
This is a reasonable fear but it is
unlikely that a minority as large and
as self-aware as American Blacks
could be eclipsed by the so-called
dominant White culture,

| would rather not plunge into the
argument surrounding the above
issue. The point is that as long as
many Whites at W&L encounter
hostility from Blacks it is unlikely
that any interest in “what Blacks
want” will arise, If White students
feel threatened and see separatism
in the activity of the Blacks, it is
unlikely that any barriers will be
broken down and any understand-
ing achieved.

Now the obvious response to this
is that the Blacks do not feel hostile
nor remain separate by choice but
rather as a reaction to hostility and
separatism on the part of the Whites.
And thus we get to a chicken and

egg question as far as the W&L
community 1s concerned, with good
reason to believe that the Whites
instigated the cycle.

Thus, it becomes imperative for
the cycle to be broken because it is
endless. How to break out? The an-
swer is not new and it is the point
of this column. Obviously human
charity is the only solution. This
will take courageous action. It will
require White students to offer
themselves while fearing rejection
and Black students to accept while
fearing insincerity and ulterior mo-
tives. In other words, a concerted
effort at mutual trust. This can not
possibly be easy, but it is impera-
tive.

This is an urgent call for under-
standing. The Blacks at W&L must
know that all White students don’t
resent them, don’t hate them, and
don’t desire to see them suppressed.
Most are indifferent and though
better than hate, it will not do,
What is required is not a commit
ment to social crusading. Racial har-
mony will not be the result of reach-
ing out for organization but of per-
sonal action.

It has been a long battle, It might
never end, There are no winners,
Surely we are weary. Cannot we
now put down the hateful swords
and simply begin to live together?

If you didn’t work, you didn’t get

of work for everyone; they have a
hard time getting enough food for
everyone, Since not everyone can
work in the fields or paddies, other
work is found for them, such as
clearing roads for visiting American

We could do the same thing here.
There is certainly a lot of work that

The usual assessments of the
People’s Republic of China in the
U.S., to this point in time, have
been, on the whole, pretty unfavor-
able. The general line of reasoning,
or more appropriately, UN-reason-
ing, has been much like that of the
lV viewers | mentioned earlier.

Theirs is a_ basically one-sided,
ignorant, and therefore wrong point
of view from which to approach the
subject .If you compare the pro-
gress of the Chinese nation from
1949 to the present with the pro-
gress of the United States from the
Revolution (that is, the FIRST
American Revolution) up to about
1815, which is an equivalent amount
of time, you can easily see that the
Chinese have progressed much fas-
ter.

Some would agree that they have
had more manpower and_techno-
logy to work with than we did in
our nation’s early years. This is
true. However, the Chinese have
an immensely greater number of
people than we did. So I think the
comparison will show that the Chin-
ese have done much better than we
did. This is a great blow to our na-
tional ego, but the truth sometimes
hurts things like the ego.......

The Chinese have gone farther in
23 years than we did in 80 or 90.

only looked, but saw. Not only
heard, but listened. He had a mar-
velous opportunity,

the education and contacts” at
Washington and Lee according to
Dean John. The school is small
enough so that a great degree of in-
formal communication is possible—
not only between administrators but
also between them and other mem-
bers of the University community.

The abundance of communica-
tions channels at Washington and
Lee creates, at least, the feeling, if
not the actuality, that one’s ideas
and opinions and complaints are
considered seriously and sincerely.
The actuality that the University is
indeed receptive is best demon-
strated in the nature of reforms that
have taken place at the school over
the past few years. Relaxation of
parietals, revised curriculum, new
course offerings, the exchange pro-
gram, and the new $56-million
building program are some of the
examples of how the administra-
tion—from the trustees on down—
have responded to the need for
change.

If the actuality (and, too, the feel-
ing) of competence, flexibility and
concern on the part of the admini-
stration are not evident to or realiz-
ed by a segment of the University
community, the cries of the dis-
pleased have been faint and few.
There is an obvious but not ob-
structive air of confidence and op-
timism on the part of administrators
themselves with regard to the job
