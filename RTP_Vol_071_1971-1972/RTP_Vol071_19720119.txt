Raising Hogs For Fun and Profit

ton Post columnist and television
personality, and Joseph Heller, cele-
brated author of the comic war
novel Catch-22, will be featured
speakers during the upcoming ‘Con-
tact’ symposium. In addition, it
was announced that prominent Vir-
ginia artist Barclay Sheaks will visit
the W&L campus under ‘Contact’
auspices.

According to ‘Contact’ co-chair-
men Roger Munsick and Skip Pau-
kert, von Hoffman will talk about
“The Problems of ‘loday’s Jour-
nalist.” His address is scheduled for

Wednesday, February 2, at 8 p.m.
in Lee Chapel,
Heller will be the concluding

speaker in this year’s ‘Contact’ pro-
gram, slated for Wednesday, Feb-
ruary 9, also at 8 p.m. in the Cha-

pel.

The remaining speakers in the
symposium will be revealed next
week,

Von Hoffman, who is considered
to be in the vanguard of the “New
Journalism” movement, is well-
known to Post readers for his regu-
lar commentary on the front page
of the ‘Style’ section. He is also fre-
quently seen debating issues with
James J. Kilpatrick on CBS televi-
sion’s “Sixty Minutes” and the
“CBS Morning News.”

The outspoken von Hoffman has
been a Post staff writer for five
years, His books include “Mississip-
pi Notebook,” “We Are the Chil-
dren Our Parents Warned Us
Against.” “Two, Three Many More,”
and “Left at the Post.”

CR’s Sponsor Congressman

Heller is a Phi Beta Kappa gra-
duate of New York University and
received a Master's degree from
Columbia, He subsequently studied
at Oxford as a Fulbright Scholar.

After flying more than sixty mis-
sions as a B-25 bombadier during
the Second World War, he worked
as an advertising copywriter until
beginning Catch-22 in 1953, Work-
ing after hours and during vaca-
tions, he completed the work eight
years later,

Heller's play, We Bombed in New
Haven was produced on Broadway
and was termed by Newsweek, “very
likely the most powerful play about
contemporary irrationality an
American has written.” He has
written a stage version of Catch-22
which is headed for Broadway.

Heller's second novel, Something
Happened, is scheduled for publica-
tion in the near future. He is also
the author of several articles and
film scripts.

Barclay Sheaks, one of Virginia's
most prominent painters, is a gradu-
ate of Virginia Commonwealth Uni-
versity, and the Richmond Profes-
sional Institute. He will present a
demonstration of watercolors and
acrylics in the Student Center on
Monday, February 7.

Sheaks has exhibited paintings
in museums throughout the country,
including the Mobile Art Gallery,
the Virginia Museum, the Corcoran
Gallery of Art, and the National
Academy of Design. His work has
been reproduced in “Prize Winning
Art.” and he has written pamphlets

Robinson To Speak

Congressman J, Kenneth Robin-
son will speak on Thursday, Janu-
ary 20 at 7:30 in Lee Chapel. He
is a member of the U.S. House of
Representatives from the Seventh
District of Virginia. His speech is
being sponsored by the Washington
and Lee University Republican
Club.

Mr. Robinson will be introduced
by Mr. Charles Phillips, Mayor of
Lexington and an Economics Pro-
fessor at Washington and Lee. Con-
gressman Robinson will speak on
the topic of “Military Appropria-
tions and U.S, Defense Posture”

A Republican, Robinson was

elected to Congress for the first
time in 1970. He was recently ap-
pointed to the House Appropriations
Committee, a great honor for a
Freshman Representative. During
his first term, Robinson has earned
a reputation among Democrats and
Republicans alike as being an ex-
ceedingly hard working representa-
tive, a reputation which greatly con-
tributed to his being named to the
House Appropriations Committee.

Following the address, there will
be a reception for Congressman
Robinson in the University Center
Cockpit, Both functions are open
to the public.

Group To Study
Honor System

A special study group is being
formulated to provide an extensive
review of the W&L honor system,
and this week the four juniors
spearheading the effort are calling
for help from any interested stu
dents.

The study group will conduct a
series of interviews with
persons, ¢.g., professors,
dent body officers,
sels of past public honor trials, and
representatives of other schools who
might shed some light on the pres
ent problems and possible solutions
concerning the system. The
will then disseminate the gathered
information by publishing reports
weekly in the Ring-tum Phi.

“Our interviews will be followed
by an overall review and appraisal
of the accumulated material,” said
a spokesman for the group. “This
data and the groups evaluation will
then be presented to the student
body.” The nucleus of juniors re
sponsible for the idea included Bob
Brennan, Archer Frierson, Rick
Gray, and Bill Merrill

The study group has been sanc
tioned by the EC, but it was em
phasized that they will operate on a
totally independent basis. The pur
pose of the weekly
Ring-tum Phi will be to inform the
student body as the examination pro

| OUTLOOK and}

January 19, 1972

In 1914 Omicron Delta Kappa, America’s foremost lead-

ership fraternity, was founded at Washington and Lee Uni-2

versity. One of the original undergraduate founders, Rupert
Nelson Latture, is still actively contributing to the Univer-
sity.

It was Latture and his roommate who were instrumental
in the founding of the society. They had hoped to form a
group where leaders of both the student body and faculty
could interchange ideas. At, that time. this undergraduate
served the University as a student instructor in French. The
two roommates concluded that a society was needed “to,
recognize all campus leaders.” The concept was warmly re-
ceived by professors at W&L and Dr. Henry Louis Smith,’
president of the school.

It was Latture who drafted the design of the Omicron
Delta Kappa key. In his words “I took two coins out of my
pocket and drew a circle incorporating the letters ‘ODK’ and
15 stars, representing the 15 founding members.”

Latture commented, “It never occurred to us that the soe-
iety would spread as it has to other universities.” However,”

the leadership fraternity has grown to more than 115 chapters

on campuses nationwide. OD is recognized as the most
prestigous honor for collegiates outside Phi Beta Kappa .

Although Rupert Latture is: best known perhaps as a
founder of ODK, his contributions and loyalty to W&L are
astounding. He received his bachelor’s degree in 1915 with
the highest grades in his class, and acquired his master’s de-
gree just a year later from Washington and Lee. After an
absence of a few years (service in World War I and the Croix
de Guerre), he returned to teach once again at W&L. Lat
ture was a teacher of Political Science for the next five de-

cades. At the age of 70 Professor Latture left his teaching ... The Ring-tum Phi has received

tasks and became a special advisor to the president of Wash-
ington and Lee University. Today Rupert Nelson Latture
works full time in Washington Hall, which brings you to the
point of this entire editorial: Monday was Professor Latture’s
cightieth birthday. Professor Latture, you have done so much
for this institution over a period of 60 years that it boggles
the senses. The Ring-tum Phi thanks you for what you have
done, and are doing. Congratulations on your eightieth birth-
day!

J.W.R.

Another service organization bites the dust. The Circle
K Club. directionless and discouraged, decided to fold last
week. Not only did its members lack the enthusiasm needed to
make a service effort successful, but the community response
as well had been apparently lackluster.

The fact is that, in-past years,“W&L service clubs have
largely depended on fraternities for recruitment and organiza-
tion, Since the fraternities have rapidly lost about every ves-
tige of their one-time campus control, many worthy activities
have ironically suffered as a result, The once-touted Student
Service Society, for instance, is a campus mystery. It has
lately crept in and out of the-eampus scene, like the fog, with
nary a good deed left behind to affirm its existence.

One wonders whether or not it is worth the trouble to
once more decry that proverbial W&L malady; Apathy, But
despite the demise and/or dormancy of the organizations
mentioned above, there still remains plenty of work to be
done, and ample channels exist to direct sincere community
involvement.

The premier outlet for student energy is the University
Federation. A group whieh has threatened to founder at its
moorings during the last several years, the Federation has
now become an active, dynamic focus for social projects under
the leadership of Bob Foley, Blessed with a sizable budget
and a conscientious membership, the University Federation
is surely the organization to join for those who wish to follow
through on their community concern.

A second opportunity for student involvement is offered
by the tutorial program conducted in conjunction with the
Lexington school system, This project has been praised by
local teachers and principals, but student participation: has
fallen off since Christmas. Those who have worked in the pro-
gram have attested to its rewards, and students are asked to
devote no more than one or two hours a week to help Lexing-
ton children learn. Contact Professor Ray (Payne 3218) or
Professor Imeson (Howe 313) for details.

Washington and Lee had seemingly been transformed two
years ago, when suddenly, after Kent State and the Cambodian
venture, the students were lifted from the daily routine and
mobilized to express boldly their concern. The action and in-
volvement during that well-remembered May was unpre-
cedented.

What has happened since? One is tempted to fall into eyn-
icism, to suggest that all that stirring social concern lasted
only as long as the students felt the threat of their own per-
sonal reeruitment into the Vietnam ranks,

Those who profess true social concern must prove the
cynies wrong; it is up to them to demonstrate that their ideals
are more than mere ephemeral notions, It is time for all W&L
students to consider giving up just one or two hours out of the
week to offer the underpriviledged in the community some-
thing more than words.

Despite my growing unrest over
the Nixon administration, 1 have
seen no viable alternative that can
produce anything but the same
bland statism the President has been
engaged in for the past four years.
No major figure in either camp is
anything but a hollow echo of
Nixon; none of these presidential
hopefuls would return to us any of
our personal liberties or work in
any way to reverse the trend of
mania which is rapidly turning free
citizens into blind slaves of an om-
nipotent state.

Nixon’s own party has no real
choice except retention of the Chief
Executive as their standard-bearer.
Not only is Nixon too firmly en-
trenched within the Republican
power structure to be unseated with-
out a destructive struggle, but he
has, as well. an exposure to the
public eye that very few potential
rivals can equal, Both ef Nixon's

A co-curricular program sponsored
by the YWCA provides many op-

in such inner-city activities as
the Headstart Program, a training
school and hospital for the handi-
capped, and recreation programs in
Lynchburg. Extracurricular activi-
ties include the Student Govern-
ment Association, an award winn-
ing newspaper, a literary magazine,
the yearbook, and many clubs and
committees. FOCUS, a lively and
ambitious student group, sponsors
programs on problems of modern

focus on consumerism and the key-
note speaker will be Ralph Nader,

The class schedule at R-M is de-

no classes on Saturday. A wide var-

I'm sorry that we are unable to

the men to arrive here between 9:00
and 9:30 so that they can have a

Odd Thoughts

BY BOB “LASH” LARUE

A few-odd thoughts born over the
weekend while breaking the ice in
my battery . Washington and
Lee’s swimming team made an in-
auspicious debut in their new aquar-
ium, losing to a youthful Virginia
Tech crew. But, if a sense of vic-
tory is reflective of one’s environ-
ment, the Generals should win all
their remaining home contests...

Swim Coach Bill Stearns’ new
playpool is one of the swankest
around, with upper level stands and

closed circuit television for those ‘

patrons who cannot see the action
/ My only complaint is that
Coach Norman Lord, who acted as
starter for swim meet, should  at-
tempt to find a muffler for his start-
ing gun. He’s got mufflers, but I'm
afraid the fans do not.

The city of Dallas came away
a double victor this past weekend.
The Cowboys cruised to a 24-3 win
over Miami in the Super Bowl to
claim the NFL championship, while
Terry Daniels, a product of SMU,
impressed viewers as a tenacious op-
ponent despite his fourth round
TKO loss to Smokin’ Joe Frazier.

Word has it that W&L Athletic
Director William McHenry is chair-
ing a Steering Committee which is
investigating the possible formation
of an athletic conference made up
of Virginia’s small colleges.

Contrary to popular rumor, | am
no relation to “Bruiser LaRue”,
whose interview has been aired fre-
quently over the radio stations. This
character, in a less than masculine
voice, affirms his love for piling on

On the whole, I was a bit dis-

Dallas victory was a classic example
of experience triumphing over a
team unfamiliar with big-game pres-
sure. But, if the Dolphins can bol-
ster their defense with the addition
of a seasoned linebacker, Miami
could be the AFC’s team of the
20's . . . And don’t be surprised

Generals Fall 86-68;

BY PALMER TRICE

The Hoopers of General Lee's
University challenged the Quakers
of Guilford College last Friday
night and Jost another tough con-
test, Few in Big Lex have heard of
this small North Carolina school.
the host team carried a 7-4 record
into the contest. Known mostly for
their run and shoot offense, the
Crimson and Grey had averaged al-
most 96 points per game during. this
no longer young season. The Quak-
ers figured to be tough to run with,
ind so the Generals sought to. avoid
this, The Blue were outrebounded
and outshot, even though they suc-
ceeded in making the home team
play W&L’s game for much of the
contest.

fhe Generals started off quickly,
grabbing an early lead. Led by the
scoring of captain Mike Daniel and
he rebounding of big Paul Me-
Clure, the Blue owned a 29-21 lead
with 4:55 to go in the first half.
Then the Generals hit a cold streak,
during which they gained only two
points. At the end of the first half,
re team trailed by 37-31.

The Generals refused to roll over
ied die. They stormed back early in
the second half, and gained a tie at
39. But from there on out, the Gen-
erals fell slowly but surely behind.
t in foul trouble and stayed

McClure fouled out, and
Daniel and Lichtfuss ended with
four apiece.

[hev g

mn tM,

The Generals played exception-
ally well for much of the first half,
but then ran into trouble. The Quak-

Florida Pres. Next

ers, who play out of the Carolina
Conference, certainly proved to be
no pushover, as the final 86-68
score indicates. The Blue faced a
tall, quick team in Guilford’s Quak-
ers. They played well, but couldn't
quite put it all together. The de-
fense has proved consistent, but
the offense has been erratic, and
anything but well-balanced,

VPI Dunks
Tankers, 63-50

The Virginia Tech Gobblers, be-
fore a capacity crowd at the New
Doremus swimming pool, spoiled
W&L’s inaugural event by defeating
the Generals 63-50. After taking an
early lead, W&L, still looking slug-
gish after Christmas break, fell vic-
tim to the young but talented VPI
team. Good performances by Bim
Clark and Bert Meem, winners in
the 50 yard free style and 200 yard
butterfly, respectively, were not
enough. The 400 yard medley relay
was also won by the W&L line-up
of Hal Catlin, Rick McCain, John
Lawlor, and Bim Clark. VPE took
every other event.

Friday's defeat left the Generals
2.1 for the season. This weekend
they travel to West Virginia Wesle-
yan, It will be interesting to see if
WAL, very strong in the freestyle
and butterfly, can beat a well bal-
anced team, such as Duke, Virginia,
or Johns Hopkins.

teristic of Republican Party dogma
and doctrine. He hasn't made these
changes out of moral enlightenment
but for the purpose of political
power.

So the cynics say what's the prob-
lem, all men are guided by self-in-
terest and we should only be happy
that Nixon's self-interested activity
is working toward the advancement
of the country, This may be true
but I tend to think that in spite of
the predominance of contrary evi-
dence there are moral men in this
world guided by other motivations
than pure self- interest. I mentioned
that though there are indicators of
a regeneration of our country we
are still sick, The sickness comes
from corrupt leadership through-
out the nation, The corruption has
become so common that it is gradu-
ally becoming acceptable. Accom-
panying this acceptance which some
would call realism and others would
label as sophistication is an un-
avoidable loss of innocence which is
pervaded by corruption itself. In
other words, the lack of morality on
the part of the leadership of any
group will inevitably infect the
whole people. Result? The decline
of the people and ultimately self-
destruction,

KEEPSAKE DIAM

HOW TO PLAN YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND WEDDING

Thus, we are confronted with a
paradox which | stated above, that
is, the coming forth of good from
evil, How will history judge Rich-
ard Nixon? History deals in facts
and thus it is not unreasonable to
predict a favorable evaluation of
the Nixon years. The presence of
immoral leadership is a difficult
thing to document and it is likely
that any such speculative evalua-
tions as this will be largely ignored,
Thus if the fruit is succulent and
sweet except for a maggot-infested
cores was the consumed sweetness
from a rotten fruit?

Nixon hopefully will fall prey
to the handy maxim that you can't
fool all the people all of the time.
For despite his surface doctoring of
the desperately ill patient he will
not heal the deeper sicknesses of
cynicism, expediency and disillu-
sion, Only moral leadership will
heal these ills.

So what is the answer? Indica-
tions are that Nixon will be re-
elected (after all he's been cam-
paigning for four years) and the
men who appear to be morally
principled can't break into the com-
plex semi-permeable membrane
which envelopes the leadership hier-
archy of our country. I have given
as much of an answer as I have, |
have only the observation that the
direction we are going is being
speedily followed and the potential
damage of another four years of
Tricky Dick is frightening.

Small: No Alternative To Nixon

(Continued from page 2)

from these renegades, Although
Yorty could present a strong and
decisive campaign quite able to
topple Nixon's carefully engineered
politics, he does not have the back-
ing from his party fellows to win
the nomination. Wallace, on the
other hand, will cut heavily cut into
Nixon's vote without any more
harm aside from, quite possibly, re-
placing one political mechanic with
another.

This is not a year for charisma
and youth, It is rather a time of
slick campaigns and slicker politi-
cians. The Common Man cannot
hope to win in this election: with
some luck, he might manage a draw,
but that basic requirement of cour-
age and conviction which could toss
the statists from their mighty
thrones appears to have deserted the
major rivals and left behind an in-
sane desire to follow the trend of
oppression we have become accus-
tomed to. It is not a pleasing pro-
spect: we can only hope that the

future will produce statesmen more
concerned with public welfare than
in the cheap gamesmanship of poli-
tics.

UC Discusses Coeducation

(Continued from page 1)
He suggested that a commitment
could thus be made anytime to go
coed, and that this commitment
would be fulfilled when the univer-
sity has expanded,

A concern was also expressed by
Jarrett on alumni reaction to an
immediate move to coeducation, A
“loss of identification with W&L”
was feared by most observers.

Lewis Powell, student, then ex-
pressed that W&L has “a respon-
sibility to remain male.” He noted
the recent trend in Eastern schools
to go coed and theorized that if the
trend continued, there would deve-
lop a definite limiting factor in giv-
ing men a choice as to whether they
would prefer to attend a coed in-
stitution or not. He also expressed
the fear that coeducation and ex-
pansion in general might adversely
affect the Honor System.

Steve Robinson, President of the
Student Body, then summed up his
feclings as a student on the issue.
He noted that if W&L expanded,
there would be a need for more
room, but if it remained at its pres-
ent size and went coed, the athletic
program and the fraternities would
be threatened. On the other hand,
he stated that coeducation would
“help Lexington . . . It’s good to
have women in the classroom, too.”

Dr. Edward Pinney then express-
ed what he thought might be a “de-
ceptively simple” opinion on the is-
sue and rhetorically asked, “Why
can't we just take 10, 50, 75, 100,
or even 300 women this fall? The
only thing stopping us is the rule
disqualifying women.” He mention-
ed that there would thus be no need
to physically “replace” men, but
rather, W&L would assimilate
women year by year.

Dr. Jarrett stated in support of
the issue, “If you hold out on na-
tional trends (going coed), it puts
you in a difficult position.” He of-
fered that W&L would draw a
“much finer student body” by going
coed, The doctor again cited the in-
crease of applications at Yale,
Princeton, and other colleges recent-
ly going coed, and noted that a
much finer selection of students

would result,

Dr. Hodges then brought up
subject of W&L’s unique statur
and said, “if a small liberal arts co
lege is to survive, it must be uniq
and there must be a demand for i
uniqueness.”

On this, President Huntley e)
pressed the unique quality of W&l
“There is no other institution in tl
United States of our size with th
breadth of curriculum which w
have, The values of a small colleg
campus—that is our quality, Ot
potential for uniqueness is that w
are small, deep, and broad in aci
demic terms, and we do it operatin
in the black.

“What will a significant variabl
(coeducation) do?” he continued, “
is a question of whether coeducatio
is important enough to have to b
introduced as a variable .. . whet!
er or not it is undesirable for W&
to seek and achieve cocducation ¢
its present size.”

The meeting thus closed on a
air of uncertainty as to what kins
of stand the U.C. would take o
the issue of coeducation at W&l
It was motioned that both coedu
cation and the Honor System b
brought up for discussion at th
next meeting.
