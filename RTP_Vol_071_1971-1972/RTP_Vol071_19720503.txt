Mock Convention delegates de-

the proposed platform must register
with either of the two Co-chairmen

or Administrative Assistant, Brad
Moore.
Ihe deadline for registration is

According to Moore, “We

issues, but at the same time we do
not want to needlessly drag out the
platform debate. We want the dele-
gates to be ready for the nomina-

all, that is the main purpose of the
Mock Convention.

The proposed platform, outlined
in last week's Ring-tum Phi, was
made public earlier this week.

Already it has sparked consider-
able controversy on campus. Pro
posed planks include the nationali-
zation of major industries and
guaranteed income.

each plank

According to Moore "The

The proposed rules
call for platform debate to be de
cided by voice vote. A roll call vote
may be substituted if requested by
either ten delegation chairmen or by

Faculty Cancels Classes

Mock Convention Starts Friday

BY PAUL LANCASTER

The tradition and festivity of
American party politics arrives at
W&L this weekend as students act
out their version of the 1972 Na-
tional Democratic Convention, So
that siudents may participate more
fully in the Mock Convention, the
faculty has cancelled all classes for
Friday, May 5.

In conjunction with the event,
Charles F. Phillips, Jr. Mayor of
Lexington, has declared Friday and
Saturday to be “Mock Convention
Days” for the city.

The festivities will begin Friday
at noon with the traditional parade
through downtown Lexington. Vir-
ginia’ Attorney General Andrew
Miller will preside as parade mar-
shal. The parade will feature more
than 50 floats sponsored by state
delegations and candidate commit-
lees.

At 3 p.m. that day, the first official
session will be called to order. At
that time, Governor Jimmy Carter
of Georgia will deliver the keynote

address in new Doremus Gym-
nasium,

Friday night at 7:30 p.m., the
second session will be called to

order, and the platform will be pre-
sented to the student delegates by
the Platform Committee. Amend-
ment and approval of the platform
will be conducted, followed by the

Change Platform

The platform debate is scheduled
for the Mock Convention's second
session at 7:30 Friday night.

Major points of the platform in

acceptance of the approved plat-
form by Alaska Senator Mike Gra-
vel on behalf of the national Demo-
cratic party.

The platform itself will reflect
nationwide student opinion on top
national issues, This is in contrast
with the balloting for the party's
Presidential nominee, which will at-
tempt to predict the outcome of the
National Democratic Convention to
be held in July.

The student delegates will recon-
vene at 9 a.m. Saturday morning to
begin the balloting to pick the De-
mocratic candidate for president,
At this time, the Chairman will ae-
cept names to be placed in nomi-
nation for the Democratic candi-
date. This year, potential nominees
must have at least 50 delegate votes
—with no more than 20 per state
counting as valid—to be officially
nominated,

The roll call of the state delega-
tions for the selection of a candi-
date will follow the nominations.
[he order of the roll call this year
will not be in alphabetical order, as
it has been in the past. Rather,
positions on the official role have
been determined by lot. At the
Mock Convention, Arkansas will
be the first state on the role, while
Colorado is the final delegation of
the list.

It was stressed by convention of-

 

Senior Banquet

The WA&L Alumni Associa-

in honor of graduating seniors at
7 p.m., Wednesday, May 17, at
Evans Dining Hall. A reception
at the Alumni House will pre-
cede the banquet, commencing
at 5:30 p.m. All Academic and
Law seniors, as well as those
who will graduate in the fall and
winter of 1972 or in February
1973, are invited to attend.

The seniors who expect to gra-
duate in the fall and winter of
1972 or February 1973 are asked
to notify the Alumni Office if
they will attend the banquet.
Notification must be made prior
to May IS.

Mr. William Washburn, Exe-
cutive Secretary of the Alumni
Association, said that the ban-
quet is given by the Association
to honor the seniors and wel-
come them into the membership

may not qualify to be officially

nominated, delegates may still cast
their ballots for that candidate.
After the selection of a Presidential
nominee, the winning candidate will
be contacted by convention officials
and asked to address the convention
itself,

After the Presidential nomination,
which is expected to take place at
around 3 p.m. Saturday afternoon,
the chairman of the convention will
accept nominations for the office of
Vice-President. The convention will
adjourn upon the selection of a

thinks that Muskie will make his

The Wilbur Mills camp, headed
by floor leader Mark Grobmeyer,
may present a twist to the conven-
tion that has been in speculation
for some time. “Basically, we think
that Mr. Mills wants to keep his
Arkansas delegation for his own
manipulation — possibly for the
Vice-presidency,” said Grobmeyer.
He suggested that a Ted Kennedy-
Mils ticket may be in the mind of
the powerful Arkansas Congress-
man. “They've been travelling to-
gether at times recently, and it's
been hinted at the Mills office.
Chere’s been a lot of talk, It just
might be what's going to happen.”

Senator McGovern’s camp ex-
presses optimism, as MeGovern is
the current leader in the overall
primary race. The co-floor leaders,
Steve Woodruff and John Ham-
mond, admit that the real conven-
tion will be “hard to figure. We
cant be clairvoyant.” They also
said that their primary tasks will in-

Changing of the Guard

The changing of the Guard at the Ring-tum Phi comes but
once a year, and, first of all, it’s time to thank our veteran
staffers. They have endured, it seems, one long harried ex-
perience to get this paper out on time week after week. Editor
John Robinson deserves our special gratitude for his guidance
in the craft of Putting It All Together journalistically. As a
result, we have acquired all kinds of invaluabe and creative
techniques, not the least of which is learning to spell “Ring-
tum Phi” with the dash in the right place.

Secondly, this is the time to take stock of the publication—
where we have been and where we can go with it next year,
We are not deaf to the criticisms and complaints that have
come our way this year. There is no doubt that the Ring-tum
Phi should be improved, and there is no reason why these
pages cannot see considerable change—in style, content, and
format. Any publication must be vigilant to avoid stagnation ;
any newspaper has to remain topical and lively to preserve its
own readership.

Obviously, though, idle mutterings do not make construc-
tive criticism. If you have some imaginative ideas and willing-
ness to put them to the test in print, we urge (cajole, implore,
even beg) you to come see us in the Reid Hall office. The
ranks of the new staff will have several openings, among them,
reporters, editors, columnists, circulators, and reviewers.

There will also be a Spring organizational meeting for the
staff next week. Watch for posters announcing time and place.

Who’s Killing the Honor System?

Here we go again. We have just witnessed the third public
honor trial of the year, a phenomental record indeed. Before
last year there had been only four public honor proceedings
in the history of the university.

We do not intend to comment on the trial that has recently
concluded; the defendant was innocent of an honor offense,
as was decided by the jury. But there is no escaping the im-
pression that there is something terribly wrong with the state
of the Honor System at Washington and Lee, not as a result
of this or any other single occurrence or factor, but rather
as a result of a compendium of factors vital to the well-being
of any community of trust.

No doubt the Executive Committee has been partly culp-
able, and they would perhaps be the first to admit it. The
education of freshmen during Orientation Week last Sep-
tember seemingly failed to drive home the scope and jurisdic-
tion of the Honor System here. Plans are already in the works
to amplify this aspect of orientation for next year’s incoming
class; dormitory counselors will be given greater responsibil-
ity to emphasize the function and operation of the Honor
System,

But let's face it—-the increasing occurrence of honor trials
have not involved only freshmen. One most distressing fact
was brought before the EC by law student Rudd Smith, who
serves as a member of the university Athletic Committee.
Evidently, $775 worth of equipment (not $75 worth as was
mistakenly reported in these pages last week) has been stolen
from the new Doremus Gymnasium since its opening in mid-
January.

Secondly, the library has been plagued with missing books
all year. Many professors and students can attest to the fact
that books on the reserve shelf, needed for research and sup-
posedly available for everyone, have been removed illegally
for weeks until the shelves are nearly empty.

And as a result of these occurrences the use of identifica-
tion cards has been suggested once again, just when we
thought we had dispensed with the problem in the Dining
Hall. But can we blame those members of the university com-
munity who are suffering from this breakdown of trust to try
to find some solution for it? If the students don’t respond,
the response will be made for them,

Many have complained that a student can no longer be
convicted of an honor violation, because the absolute penalty
is outmoded; a student jury, it is reasoned, is reluctant to
dismiss a student from the university on the basis of a single
offense,

But whether or not this premise is valid (and it certainly
is questionable), it is unrealistic to look for a solution through
amendation of the Honor System itself. To change the ab-
solute penalty would require a change in the university char-
ter which stipulates it. And this would take a two-thirds vote
of the student body to effeet, a vote which anyone knows
could not be mustered in the foreseeable future.

No, we must look in another direction for a cure for our
ailing honor system, We must, first of all, recognize that
thieves do exist at Washington and Lee and must bring this
point to bear on the indifferent students among us.

There is reason to hope, With an improvement in fresh-
man orientation, our Honor Code may probably weather this
particular threat, but it will take the attention and aid of every
student to preserve the trust that we have known here,

Eyewitness Account

This letter was received by the
Mock Convention Office this week,
written by 84-year-old Wheatley M.
Johnson who helped to organize the
first Mock Convention at W&L
back in 1908, At that time Four-
time Presidential Candidate William
Jennings Bryan spoke in Lexington,
and here Mr. Johnson clears up a
few historical points about that oc-
casion. Mr. Johnson plans to visit
Lexington again this weekend for
the upcoming proceedings,

—Ed.

The account of the start of these
Conventions in “General Lee’s Col-
lege” is the only incorrect item that
I have seen in the excellent book,
when it states that William Jen-
nings Bryan made a speech in Lex-
ington in his campaign for the third
time for the Presidency.

While it is true that a speech by
Mr. Bryan started the idea, it was
not a political speech.

Mr. Bryan’s appearance in Lex-
ington that year, was of a type that
all of the candidates this year would
be glad to have an opportunity to
fill.

He came as a paid speaker as one
of a series of events in a Chautauqua
series. It is almost impossible for
the present generation to envision a
world without television, radio or
even speech amplifiers but in 1908
that was the case and in order to
properly educate the public, most
sections of the country had these
series of entertainments, usually a
musical one, an acting one, and a
speech by a good orator and tickets
were sold for the series (three, four
or more appearing about two or
three weeks apart). This was the
reason for the appearance of Mr.
Bryan in Lexington and his speech
was non-political, “The Price of
Peace”.

Of course he was not only paid
for the speech but also had an op-
portunity to campaign on the trip.

At any rate, a few days later, W.
Jett Lauck, assistant professor of
economics and politics conceived the
idea of a Mock Convention and
called together several of his stu-
dents and we took a list of the stu-
dent body and made up the state
delegations,

In that year Bryan was the lead-
ing candidate for the Presidency
and while there were no primaries,
his only opposition was Gov. John
A. Johnson of Minnesota, the choice
of the conservatives, and he died of

Costs Revealed

For Convention

The total cost of this year's Mock
Convention, according to Co-Chair-
man Mike Campilongo, will be ap-
proximately $12,500. The student
body has already contributed $3,800
towards that goal.

Each student contributed $3.00
which was taken up in the matri-
culation line in September,

Law student David Walsh, in
charge of finances for the Mock
Convention says that he is confident
that $12,500 goal will be reached.
“The deficit will be made up by
contributions from alumni and ad-
vertisements in the Mock Conven-
tion Journal. Contributions are con-
tinuing to flow into the Convention
office.”

According to Walsh, revenue from
Journal advertisements totals $1,500.

Principle expenses for the Mock
Convention include acquiring and
decorating facilities for the actual
convention ($2,500). The Mock
Convention is allowing $2,500 for
political research and $2,000 for
telephone expenses.

Credentials Committee Chairman
Fred Franke notes that these figures
represent over six months of work.
“The Mock Convention has been
working all year long. We brought
several speakers to Lexington in
hopes of helping state chairmen with
their research.”

Facilities Chairman Lou Hannah
has reserved five telephones exclu-
sively for the press covering the
Mock Convention. He also has
worked with the telephone company
in arranging a hook-up which will
allow the winning candidate to ad-
dress the convention via telephone.
There will also be telephones re-
served for State Chairman to make
last minute calls to political experts.

The Meck Convention Journal
was printed in the Journalism Lab-
oratory Press at a cost of $1,800.

Protocol Chairman Jeff Twardy
was budgeted $1,500 to cover the
expenses involved with transporting
and housing the Mock Convention's
principle speakers, U.S. Senator
Mike Gravel and Georgia Governor
Jimmy Carter

Other expenses incured by the
Mock Convention include the cost
of the parade, mailing of letters to
alumni, printing of the platform,
press relations, printing of posters,
imsurance, clean-up and stationery.

a heart attack several weeks before
the national convention.

The nominees of our convention
were Bryan and Senator Culberson
of Texas as Vice President. We had
a very nice letter from Culberson
when we notified him, but he stated
that he was not a candidate.

Some of the Virginia papers ap-
proved of the idea of the Mock
Convention and some had editorials
saying that we would have been bet-
ter off doing the studies in the Col-
lege Courses.

How we put over the Convention
with practically no funds and why
it has lasted | don’t know but | do
think it has helped to give the stu-
dent body of Washington and Lee a
better insight into the problems that
confront us and a better knowledge
of finding solutions for those prob-
lems.

History of The Mock Convention

A Backward Glance
BY PETE FUREY

As Wheatley M. Johnson ‘08
writes, William Jennings Bryan
visited Lexington in the spring of
his senior year, That speech spark-
ed a sudden and keen interest in na-
tional politics. Prof. W. Jett Lauck’s
spur-of-the-moment idea has regen-
erated itself 13 times. The Mock
Convention which convenes _ this
Friday will mark W & L’s fifteenth
convention.

The Mock Convention has proven
itself correct in ten of those at-
tempts. The last mistake came in
1948. Since then Lexington prognos-
tigators have enjoyed an unblemish-
ed two decades.

Newsweek wrote in 1960, “The
occasion was W&L’s twelfth conven-
tion, the most realistic of the dozens

‘Convention Mockery.’
A Dissenting Viewpoint

BY PAT HINELY

The leadership of the Mock Con-
vention seems to be avoiding one
of the basic questions they must
face in order to justify all the time
and money which has gone into the
extravaganza scheduled for this
weekend.

That is the question of deciding
between putting on a good, realistic
show or putting on a good, realistic,
show, along with some positive di-
rection coming out of the whole
thing.

American politics being as cor-
rupt as they are, it would seem that
such an “intelligent” group of young
people would want to do more with
an opportunity such as the Mock
Convention than play along with
old folks’ games.

Not so, it seems. Nearly all the
participants in this mock mockery I
have talked to discuss the whole
matter in the same way 10-year-old
boys act when they're playing such
intellectual games as “cowboys and
indians” or “cops and robbers.”

Some of the convention officials
have been a bit close-mouthed about
releasing very routine-type infor-
mation. The back rooms are already
filling with smoke, and it's not the
right kind of smoke. They say the
rest of us should just “play along
with the game.”

Well, the game is SICK. Those
people must have realized that by
now, That is why | was surprised
to learn that these supposedly in-
telligent persons are content, even
happy. to play along with it them-
selves.

If all the Mock Convention is
going to be is a replica of Conven-
tions in the past. it is a waste of
time as well as money, It would be
a Mockery in more ways than one,
A mockery of the U.S. Constitution,
and thus a mockery upon all of us
as Americans. This is the bad dream
we don't wake up from: men play-
ing games with our government, our
money, our lives. This is what we,
meaning our generation, have to
change. That begins with you, dele-
gales.

Wheeling and dealing in the
“usual” manner will undoubtedly
give you participants in this mock
mockery some kind of childish sat
isfaction for having power and for
having used it, Richard Nixon is
involved in these kinds of activities
daily, on a worldwide scale.

Face it though. youre losers in
a small world, If you get any more
satisfaction from playing hide-and-
go-seek with your votes than you de
from relieving a case of constipa-
tion, there's something wrong inside
your heads. Constipation of the

mind?

Our generation is the hope of
America, or so it seems. This nation
has great potential; it’s up to us to
see that the potential is realized. If
all we're going to do is play along
with the game as it is, we don’t need
to do anything at all. Nixon, Mit-
chell, and all the rest of THEM
have been playing it much longer
than we have, and they know the
rules quite well. The most frighten-
ing thing is that they MAKE the
rules,

All we have to do is sit back and
wait for that knock on the door, or
on the head. And they don't even
have to knock anymore... .

Thus, the only logical thing to do
with this Mock Mockery is to nomi-
nate George McGovern, It would be
a pleasant change to have an honest,
believable man in the White House.

George Wallace, a man who
stands by his beliefs, though I don't
agree with many of them, made one
observation in 1968 which is still
so true that it hurts. That is that
there isn't a dimes worth of differ-
ence between Hubert Humphrey
and Richard Nixon.

Humphrey represents, and caters
to, old-line Democrats, men like
Richard Daley, That is a mockery
upon the party's name as well as the
principles it is supposedly founded
upon.

George MeGovern is a viable and
preferable alternative. At a gather-
ing of professional journalists I at-
tended a few days ago, the prevail-
ing view of McGovern is that he is
a very HUMAN candidate. Some
also said he is filling the gap Robert
Kennedy's death created. Either
way, McGovern needs to be nomi-
nated. Not for his sake, but for
ours,

So let's do it, Hf the W&L Mock
Convention is everything it claims
to be, its results will be listened to,
looked at, or whatever. There is no
other candidate the Democratic
Party can logically neminate. You
in the Convention have the oppor-
tunity to help George McGovern.
Do it. So much for endorsements

Cietiing back to the manner in
which the Convention is being con-
ducted, | can only say that men who
play small games are themselves
small.

When we have a chance to do w
much. something that will produce
posilive results and do something
for ALL. of us, why should we do
so little and just “play along?”

Enough of games, let us de some-
thing which has a larger—and bet-
ter——purpose than creating a replica
of something which is not worth be

of similar affairs held on U.S. col-
lege campuses each election year.”

An aide to Nelson Rockefeller
said in 1964 that the W&L conven-
tion was the Governor’s next most
important goal after two state pri-
maries.

At the first convention, a fight
broke out in the Kansas delegation,
politely referred to as a “heated set-
to.” Delegates streamed out of the
gymnasium to settle their differences
outside.

William Jennings Bryan emerged
as the winner, and student partici-
pation in'this simulated political pro-
cess had its precedent.

In 1912, the students narrowly
missed electing a dark horse candi-
daet after Woodrow Wilson took
the lead on the first four ballots.

With the second Mock Conven-
tion in 1912 came the first mistake.
The man destined to win the actual
Democratic Convention, Woodrow
Wilson filed in the voting for four
ballots at the W&L Convention. But
for reasons now somewhat obscure
the Mock Convention predicted the
nominee would be Judson Harmon,
Who?

Charles Evans Hughes was cor-
rectly chosen in 1916 as students
eliminated eleven other candidates.

There was no convention in 1920,
setting the stage for perhaps the
most remarkable Mock Conventions
of all time.

For 23 ballots the Mock Con-
vention was deadlocked by support-
ers for Al Smith and William Me-
Adoo. The simulated convention
nominated W&L alumnus, John W.
Davis on the 24th ballot as a com-
promise candidate. Later that year
in New York, it took the Democrats
a record 103 ballots to determine
that the college men in Lexington
were right after all.

Their credibility now respected
across the country, the 1928 Mock
Convention responded accordingly
by accurately nominating Al Smith
on the 17th ballot.

FDR was an easy choice in 1932.
His extended administration ending
in 1945, caused confusion among
Republicans. The GOP's inability to
pick a winner was also reflected in
Lexington. Spurious nominees were
produced at both the 1936 and the
1940 conventions. There was no
convention during the war year of
1944. The year 1948 brought the
convention's last incorrect nomina-
tion, The students chose Senator
Arthur Vandenburg to break a dead-
lock between Thomas Dewey and
Robert H. Taft.

From 1952 on, the Mock Conven-
tion put together a string of correct
guesses. In 1952, California gover-
nor Earl Warren sent a telegram to
his delegates, releasing them to vote
for Dwight D. Eisenhower.

1956 saw the first Democratic con-
vention in 24 years at W&L. Sena-
tor Alben Barkley of Kentucky, the
keynote speaker, suffered a fatal
heart attack in old Doremus Gym-
nasium. The convention recessed
but reconvened at Mrs. Barkley’s in-
sistence and went on to nominate
Adlai Stevenson on the fifth ballot.

Harry Truman came to Lexington
for the 1960 convention. Although
the crucial West Virginia primary
had not been paid, the convention
selected John F. Kennedy with the
help of such political leaders as
Carmine de Sapio of Tammany
Hall.

1964 was a difficult period to
access. While most colleges favored
Henry Cabot Lodge, W&L nomi-
nated Barry Goldwater on the sec-
ond ballot. The senator replied per-
sonally to the convention via tele-
phone.

Richard Nixon wen the 1968
nomination with a strong display
of organization both here and na-
tionally. He visited Lexington
shortly before the nomination.

Space Program:
A Dying Dream

BY MARC SMALL

The dream that put man on the
Moon is dead, Although the Ameri-
can space program has been an
outright success from the White
Sands experiments of the late 40's
through Mariner 9%, boosting the
economy, imereasing our scientific
knowledge and giving us tremend-
ous feedbacks into the commercial
sphere. the dynamic effort that saw
Mercury, Gemini. and Apollo push
our frontiers to the edge of the ter-
restrial system has collapsed be-
neath a welter of cynics who have
questioned its worth and advocated
a “re-ordering of priorities” to uti-
lize money now “wasied” on the
space program in more “relevant”
ways

These questions are not without
merit. Undoubtedly there were those
at the court of Queen Isabella who
advised her not to squander her
gems on the useless schemes of the

BY RAY SWAN

The W&L lacrosse team plays its
most important game of the year to-
day, coming off a shaky 13-11 win
over North Carolina last Saturday
at Wilson Field.

Towson State invades Lexington,
led by attackmen Tim Havens and
Craig Saxon who scored six goals
against Virginia. Like W&L, Tow-
son is nationally ranked and unde-
feated in conference play, having
lost only to a major national power.

“Towson is just so much better
this year than they were last year”
said head coach Dick Szlasa. In ad-
dition to deciding the conference
champs, the game will also decide
who gets the invitation to the
NCAA national tournament.

Last Saturday, both teams got off
to a shaky start but UNC got the
first three goals. Sam Englehart
shoved in two rebounded saves but
North Carolina answered with one
more goal to lead at the end of the
first period.

Scott Neese scored twice in the
second period, assisted by Ed Tog-
netti and Ted Bauer, Brian Chasney
helped Chip Thompkins — score
W&L’s fifth goal, but the Tarheels
also scored three in the period to
lead 7-5 at half. Prior to this game,
the Blue had trailed at halftime only
once, to Navy.

Chasney scored first in the third
period on Jim McCane’s assist with
10:49 left. UNC answered wit hone

Parade Begins
Gala Weekend

Not even VMI could rival the
spectacle that Bill Andrews, parade
chairman, has planned to kick-off
the 15th Washington and Lee Mock
Convention.

The traditional parade will begin
Friday at noon with the simultane-
ous ringing of Lexington’s church
bells. Containing eighty units, the
parade will feature six high school
bands, more than fifty floats spon-
sored by state delegations and can-
didate committees (including one
spectacular float titled U.S.S, Hol-
lins, with appropriate decoration),
numerous Southern Seminary Beau-
ties, Miss Virginia, and several sym-

 

bolic donkeys.

Two of the units which will high-
light the parade are the excellent
Norfolk State College band and the
Kazim Temple clowns, hailed to be
the best in the nation.

Presiding as parade marshal on
Friday will be Virginia’s Attorney
General and high-ranking Demo-
crat, Andrew P. Miller.

The parade, which is expected to
stretch for a mile and a half, will
form at Lexington High School,

scored unassisted to bring W&L
within one, 7-8, Englehart and
Tompkins scored with Chasney’s

assist, and McCane scored unassist-
ed to give the Generals the lead
10-8. Penalties left W&L two men
short and the Tarheels scored again
and trailed 10-9,

Englehart scored twice on assists
by Chasney and Neese. UNC re-
taliated with a goal with 10 minutes
left in the game. The defense im-
proved in the middle of the period,
but broke down with seven minutes
left as UNC closed to within one,
12-11. In the final minutes W&L
spread the Tarheel defense with a
slowdown attack until Englehart
broke free and scored his sixth goal
with the help of Chasney’s fifth as-
sist. Time ran out with North Caro-
lina trying to get off a shot,

Despite the close score, the Blue
beat the Tarheels in several impor-
tant categories. W&L grabbed 88
ground balls to UNC's 44 with Ted
Bauer scooping up 14, The Generals
outshot Carolina 53-39 but the
UNC goalie stopped 20 shots,

Szlasa credited John Lalley for
his play, even though he didn’t
score. Lalley was sick most of last
week and there was some question
as to whether he would play.

Szlasa said he has made no major
changes for today’s game.

a fine performance in this talented
field beating University of Florida
12-3 after succumbing to Princeton

WAL scored first against Prince

tain Fred Fletcher but from there on
the Generals were the ones who
committed the penalties. Five off-
side calls resulted in 9 points in
penalty kicks for the Tigers, who

failed to score on the ground against
a tenacious Blue defense led by Al
McWhorter, Charlie Gregory, and
Brian Greig. The W&L scrum got al-
most all the scrumdowns through

A Dying Dream

(Continued from Page 2)

mad Italian Columbus. Undoubtedly
there were those who recommended
that Henry VII not subsidize the
futile fantasies of John Cabot, Tho-
mas Jefferson was ridiculed for the
Louisiana Purchase; Alaska was re-
fered to as “Seward's Folly.” Yet
these dreams paid off in the long
run: our world teday would be non-
existent except for the faith of these
leaders in the progress of mankind.

It is beyond question that we de-
rive important benefits from the
space program. Every dollar spent
on the exploration of space returns
severalfeld in spin-offs from the

technology we gain. Television,
communications, nuclear energy,

evbernetics—all have been boosted
far beyond expectation by the re-
search originally undertaken for the
space program. Our technology—
with its direct impact on the highly-
industrialized world we live in
has been increased dramtically by
mans drive into space.

Yet. these material benefits are
not the truly important part of the
program, Underlying it there is a

dream. This is the dream of Colum-
bus, Vespucci, Leif Erikson, Magel-
lan, and Drake. This is the dream
that comes from horizon fever and
the urge to know what is beyond the
next ridge. This is the dream that
brought man to America and made
it a nation that provides more free-
doms and material benefits to more
people than any other nation in the
world.

We dare not kill this dream, for
if we do, then we kill as well the
spirit of the nation. Yet we have
killed this dream by strangling it in
red tape, legislative studies, and
cut-backs, so that our space pro-
gram is now but a shadow of its old
self. Our aerospace industry is on
the verge of collapse, the highly-
trained company of engineers that
provided the knowledge behind
Apollo and Mariner are un-employ-
ed, and we are on the verge of los-
ing the technology so laboriously
garnered during the past two de-
cades,

We dare not sacrifice our spirit

This sketch depicts the seating arrangements for delegations and public in “Mock Convention Hall,” New Doremus Gymnasium,

in the interest of cheap polemics

will provide but temporary benefits
and will set us on the course of
collapse. The spirit behind Apollo
must be resuscitated: we must con-
tinue our drive into the universe if
for no other reason than to fan the
flames of our spirit and to keep
alive the dreams that founded this
nation on the vision of the few.
