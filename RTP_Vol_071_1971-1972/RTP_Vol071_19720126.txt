W. H. Auden is considered by
many critics to be the greatest
living poet writing in English, In
addition, the versatile and_ prolific

Auden is known as a reviewer, es-
sayist, dramatist, translator, libret-
tist, educator, and editor.

He has been the recipient of num-
crous awards, including the Pulitzer
Prize, the National Book Award,
the Bollingen Prize for Poetry, the
Guinness Poetry Award, and the
National Medal for Literature,

Auden was born in York, England,
and was trained in biology at Gres-
ham’s School, Holt. While attend-
ing Christ Church, Oxford, from
1925 to 1928, he became part of a
literary circle, which included Step-

hen Spender, C, Day Lewis, and
Christopher Isherwood, His friends
saw him during those college days
as somewhat of a deliberate clown-
er, “a peculiar amalgam of mental
surgeon, witchdoctor and buffoon,”
according to critic Dennis Davison.
An early verse play, Paid on
Both Sides written in Berlin in 1928,
was termed “brilliant” by T. S. Eliot,
and the young poet began to make a
stir in the British reading public of
the Thirties. During his days in
Berlin, Auden married Erika Mann,
daughter of the famed German
novelist Thomas Mann, in order for
her to gain passport to England.
Auden, however, continued to
travel, to Iceland, China, and Spain,

along
with the left-wing
struggles there. The two
surprised England in 1939
when they left to reside in the
United States, Auden continued to
confound the literary public when
he soon professed his acceptance
of Christianity.

The poet has been an American
since 1946, living in New York. He
also maintains a spring and summer
home in Kirchstetten, Lower Aus-
tria. Auden served as Professor of
Poetry at Oxford from 1956-1961.

He has authored several volumes
of verse, among them, About the
House, Homage to Clio, The Age of
Anxiety, and Selected Poetry, Col-

where he became indentified,

Uncertain World, In adition to au
thoring two plays with Christopher
Isherwood, he has scored libretti
for operas by Stravinsky (The
Rake’s Progress) and Benjamin Brit-

Seven Deadly Sins.

Coed Referendum
Planned For Spring

The Executive Committee has de-
cided to place a referendum to as-
sess sentiment concerning coeduca-
tion on the ballot for Student Body
elections in the spring. Meanwhile,
they announced their intention to
take an official position on the is-
sue themselves, after all EC mem-
bers have read the report of the
faculty Coeducation Committee.

Junior Kurt Krumperman appear-
ed before the EC in their Monday

meeting to request action on the
coeducation issue. He said it was
time for a representative student

voice to respond to the co-ed re-
port, and that the EC “has every
responsibility to act.”

At their last session the members
of the University Council discussed
the question for over two hours
without resolving a position. They
plan, however, to resume their dis-
cussion at their next meeting on
February 3. Student Body Presi-
dent Steve Robinson has urged all
interested students to attend the
open discussion of the UC at that
time.

Krumperman suggested that the
faculty's coeducation report, written
by a team headed by Religion Pro-
fessor Louis Hodges, contains “sev
eral underlying assumptions about
the nature of women and their
needs which may be invalid.”

the thrust of the report, which
was completed just recently, is that
the cost of bolstering several de-
partments (e.g., Fine Arts, English)
to accommodate women in an exX-
panded university of 1800-2000 stu
dents would be considerable. The
report also said, however, that if the
university decided to gradually ad-
mit women, keeping the present
size of enrollment stable, the costs

OUTLOOK and REVIEW!

January 26, 1972

On Coeducation.

Coedueation is a blossoming issue at Washington and Lee.

Through necessity it seems, the School of Law recently de-
cided to accept coeds next fall. The law school had, to establish
an open door poicy for women and minority groups in order to
remain accredited by certain orgapizations,, Despite this turn-
about in formal admissions policy, most observers do not
anticipate a deluge of skirts:in Tucker: Hall. Truthfully, this
move to partial coeducation appears inconsequential con-
cerning the W&L community,

What appears more consequential is evidence of a grow-
ing undergraduate desire for regularly enrolled women at
WA&L. This desire can largely be coupled with a degree of
frustration. This frustration was obvious at the dast Univer-
sity Council meeting. Quoting from@ast week's Ring-tum Phi:
“The University Council . . . deliberated for,over two hours
and adjourned without resolution on the subject of coeduca-
tion at Washington and Lee.” The Council heard from Dr.
Louis Hodges, chairman of a recent comprehensive study on
the issue of coeducation. Dr. Hodges relayed the committee's
sentiment, “It was unanimous that it would be in the best
interest of the university to become coeducational.”

Some students may have been severely disappointed that
the University Council did not take a stronger stand either for
or against coeducation. Realizing that only the Board of
‘Trustees can alter W&L's centuries old male-only philoso-
phy, students are asking how they can express their thoughts
to the Trustees? One approach was investigated a week ago.
More than 30 students and. a faculty member met to examine
the possibility of endorsing a Student Body President candi-
date who would take an outspoken pro-coeducation stand.
Surely; the Trustees would have little difficulty: interpreting
such a candidate's victory.

The results of this meeting in Fairfax Lounge were quite
intriguing. Kurt Krumperman, an organizer of the session,
claimed that “the elections around here have been basically
issueless.”” Many people in attendance last Wednesday en-
couraged that coeducation be made into an issue this spring.
After all, the Student Body President is the most highly aud-
ible undergraduate spokesman. Krumperman shunned the
idea of getting anyone in particular elected, “Coedueation is
the main purpose of this meeting not polities.”

Bob Brennan attended this caucus and raised a logical ob-
jection to this election approach, Brennan stated that “the
President of the Student Body handles honor trials; that is
his chief responsibility. A  pro-coeducation candidate might
not be capable of conducting the proceeding of the Honor
System. Once this issue (coeducation) is gone you're stuck
with someone who couldn't help maintain the Honor System.”

This idea of making candidates take a stand on central
issues makes sense, but not at the risk of deluting. the Honor
System. This does not connote that the Honor System is
above suspicion or change, but it does mean the election of the
chief protector of the Honor Systeme the President. of the Stu-
dent Body, should not be decided on an issue he cannot settle.
Remember, only the Trustees can bring about coeducation.
Nonetheless, W&L students should express their views con-
cerning coeducation in the upcoming Mareh voting. Candi-
dates for the University council should be needled into making
stands on such salient issues as coeducation, Or possibly, as
another conerete measurement of the undergraduates’ senti-
ments, a referendum for a resolution could be voted into
effect during the regular March balloting, The resolution
could implore the Trustees to consider the student viewpoint,
Similar resolutions and certain amendments to the Student

tody Constitution have been previously attempted during the
spring electioneering period.

The faculty, administration, and student body are all con-
cerned about coeducation at W&L. The faculty and admini-
stration have made their study, The student body had better
voice a “yea or nay” soon, or this issue could be settled with-
out its influence. Via the March Student Body cleetions the
will of the undergraduates can be gauged, But please, do not
allow the next President of the Executive Committee to be
cleeted solely beeause of his inconsequential views on the
merits or faults of coeducation, Better methods of expressing
your views are available.

Letters On Parking, Girls...

Parking Causes Dismay

To the Editor of. The Ring-tum Phi:

As one of the members of Wash-
ington and. Lee’s large apathetic, seg-
ment,it is a rare phenomenon that
should motivate me. to, write to the
Ring-tum Phi, The reason for this,
of course,,is that 1 have come. to
expect little or nothing to come of
such efforts to. change something.

| have often wanted in the past to
express my dismay over several bad
aspects of what is otherwise a very
fine institution, I have been dis-
tressed, for one thing, over a school
within, this school . which, provides
some of. its professors, with strange
ego, trips, in. the form of giving
grades one grade below other de-
partments. | have yet to see the
benefits of this other. than: (1) It
serves to lower cumulative averages
and keeps more students off Dean's
List, (2) helps to create a feeling in
the  grader’s mind, similar, perhaps
to successful completion of a
Charles«Adas course, and43) helps
w reaffirm that all-important fear
of the Big C which Washington and
Lee students must maintain,

| have-also wanted, in the past, to
state my feeling that it is wrong
for a W&L student in the year 1972
to still have to verge on a sexual
fit when an attractive Hollins girl
walks through Lexington on a Wed-
nesday. The exchange program has
obviously been an optimistic attempt
to appease our natural desires for
natural relationships with members
of the other sex, But when one con-
siders that on any two “big week-
ends” W&L students will travel. in
the neighborhood of a quarter of a
million miles just to get dates, one
must judge the program as a failure
in this respect. It has failed in many
other more important areas too, as
girls on this campus will attest.

But the true incentive for this

Blows Against The Empire

“letter to the editor” comes .ncither
from my feelings about genuine co-
education or Newcombland, Rather,
it pertains to what should be a far
more. simple problem to solve:
PARKING! Indeed, after three years
of shouting at the walls of my room
over these other problems the great
motivational force to put. my gripes
in public print-came as a result of a
soggy white piece of paper jammed
under the windshield wiper of my
Volkswagon, “Your car is parked
in a ‘Restricted Parking’ area,” it
said, “2nd offense.” Whammo!!.. .
$5.00.

Now this makes me very unhappy.
Where, if 1 may ask,.am I supposed
to. park?. At the beginning of this
year | bought from Washington and
Lee University, at the price of
$15.00, a little yellow. sticker which
I thought entitled me to park my
car for classes, No one informed
me at the time that this meant park-
ing it half-a-mile away, from Wash-
ington.and Lee University.

Some students, | know, can park
in the lot in front of the Hill. This
is fine if you want to get up at 7:30
am, to find a space for your E
hour class. Also it provides. you
with an early morning challenge to
see if you can get by Rick Middle-
ton’s white Electra, the W&L dump-
ster tractor, the rest of the over-
night Phi Kap cars, and into that
seven foot slit between Alvin's and
Dennis’ cars. Other students have
chosen the VMI lot nearest duPont
Hall. This too is fine if you wish to
challenge the elements by charging
up and down a thirty foot ravine
where one also finds the true mean-
ing of mud and campus dogs.

Surely there is a better way. I, for
one, am now out $21.00 to this
school for the “privilege” of playing
hide and seek games with Murph
(who, | might add is only doing his
job). | find this incredibly ludicrous

Controversy Brewing

BY W. PATRICK HINELY

We have a potential controversy
brewing here on our otherwise nor-
mally apathetic campus, If we as
students decide to make an_ issue
of coeducation, we CAN have great
power in determining the outcome,
It will take some doing, but so did
the events of May, 1970. That got
WAL into the 20th Century.

There will be no danger from
outside agitators. Coeducation is a
very dead issue most everywhere.
Other colleges, for the most part,
have recognized the artificial na-
ture of sexually segregating their
student bodies, I have read remarks
of some leading educators who ar-
gue that sexual segregation is detri-
mental to a good education, and
very few disagree with them, |
can’

It is certainly true that W&L
would lose one of its distinctions
which makes this school so “uni-
que;” we would no longer be the
oldest all-male school in the United
States. | am sure the handkerchief
business in Lexington would enjoy
a great boom, singe we'd all be cry-
ing so much if we lost such a mean-
ingful distinction.

At the last meeting of the Uni-
versity Council, Dr, Louis Hodges
reported on the findings of the com-
mittee set up to investigate coedu-

ally unfavorable administration view
toward them have pushed a few of
the weaker houses over the edge,
but most have weathered the storm

porary,
meaningful enough to survive,
Someone said WAL has a respon-
sibility to remain all-male in order
to give those who wish to attend a
men's school a wider choice of
schools to attend, It is equally
valid to say we have a responsibil-
ity to go coed to give potential WAL
students of BOTH sexes a wider
choice of coed schools to attend,
Besides, no one of either sex would
be FORCED to associate with mem-
bers of the opposite sex outside the
classroom, though | would have my
doubts about the normality of those
who might wish to segregate them
selves, Of course, everyone is en
titled to their own bag. Many her
mits live in New York City; Im
sure our campus has room for a

few. The statement that coeducation
would threaten the honor system
was also made. I have yet to glean
any meaningful enlightenment from
that assertion.

Dr. Hodges pointed out that most
schools which have recently gone
coed have enjoyed “happy” results,
This seems logical, especially for the
students. He also cited the fact that
going coed has raised those schools’
academic calibre, in general.

There are three main choices un-
der consideration for W&L: (1) go-
ing coed and expanding, (2) going
coed and remaining at our present
size, and (3) maintaining the status
quo. Choice No. | was most favor-
ably received at the U.C, meeting,
but No, 2 makes more sense if
WAL is to retain the advantages of
being a small school. If we expand
and go coed, we'll be just another
moderately-sized coed school. Re-
maining at our present size and go-
ing coed will keep us more acade-
mically sound, as far as calibre of
students is concerned, and we as
students will continue to enjoy the
superior qualities of being educat-
ed in a small school. Choice No, 3
has no supporting arguments, unless
you happen to enjoy driving at
least ten miles for female com-
panionship, and often forty or fifty.
(Sem just isn't big enough for all
of us, nor does it appeal to all of
us.)

Last week, a group of students
met to discuss the possibility of
putting up a candidate for student
body president whose platform
would be based on favoring coedu-
cation, This certainly wouldn't hurt
the political process at WAL. Sev-
eral observations came out of that
meeting:

An all-male institution creates

an unreal atmosphere in which

the masculine view point is dom-
inant,

WAL presently functions as an

elitist institution.

THERE IS NO LEGITI-

MATE REASON WHY WA&L

COULD NOT GO COED.

| certainly can't argue against

those statements.

Unfortunately, the Board = of
Trustees, who must be persuaded to
favor coeducation, can and very
well might argue with those state-
ments, | just hope they will listen to
what Dr. Hodges’ report has to say
Let us hope they will see the rea
soning in favor of coedueation and
put an end to the socially artificial
and at times farcical nature of WAL
as it now exists,

If they don't, we as students owe
it to ourselves and those who will
take our places when we get out into
the “real” world to make our opi-
nions heard, If we voice them loud
enough and in the correct manner,
| am sure they will be listened to
We have the power to make sure

they ARE listened to,

and as,a result I shall not. pay my
latest fine until some administra-
tion member explains what is to be
done about this problem and when.
I suggest that other students do the
same,

1 do not think that Washington
and Lee should be discussing new
housing, law schools, and libraries,
until it completes unfinished busi-
ness. Parking facilities are unfinish-
ed_ business.

Is Coeducation Justified?

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

One point which I think has been
neglected in the discussion on co-
education at W&L is that in order
to justify such a sweeping altera-
tion of the University, the advan-
tages to be gained must significant-
ly outweigh not only the direct dis-
advantages of change but also the
considerations which militate against
abandoning the traditional nature
of the school.

None of the arguments presented
in last week's article on the Univer-
sity Council discussions promises
such an adyantage. The academic
standards here are already high,
and no one can promise more than
a marginal increment from the ad-
mission of women. The fact that it
would allow the admissions office
to send out more rejection notices
somehow does not strike me as a
plus.

An “improvement” in the social
and academic “atmosphere” is a
questionable plus also. W&L pro-
vides exactly the atmosphere it pro-
mised to provide—partly because it
is all male, There are many coedu-
cational institutions, all of which,
presumably, provide a co-ed “at-
mosphere.” The fact that W&L does
not cannot be construed as an indict-
ment. Remember, this issue con-
cerns not the function of the Uni-
versity, but the manner in which it
goes about performing that function.
Does anyone imagine that instruc-
tion will improve in response to
coeducation?

Finally, it is the least weighty
argument of all which seems to en-
joy the greatest credence. The fact
that Washington and Lee does not
adhere to “national trends” is its
glory, not its shame, and if its
character as the oldest all male col-
lege in the nation is a difficult posi-
tion, then it seems to be maintain-
ing that difficult position with little
adverse effect. The notion that
“national trends” have some com-
pelling force on this University is

Book Picking
Described As
Art & Science

BY BETTY MUNGER

The best thing which could hap-
pen, of course, would be that the
University turn over to the Book-
store that beautiful new gym, sauna
and all, Then, I think we might just
have enough space to stock all the
books we would like to carry. Until
that happy day there has to be some
kind of selection of what is available
for purchase,

How. are such choices made?
What determines which books are
carried and which books are avail-
able only through special orders?
After five years of operation a cer-
tain pattern has emerged at the
Bookstore. It is a combination of
wide reading of reviews (no book-
store. manager has much time for
the reading of many books—just re-
views!), a great deal of listening to
what people ask for and are inter-
ested in, plus a second sense—call
it radar—of what will be in demand
in the next few months. (Or no
sense at all, when you goof.)

There are professional tools which
are used all the time such as a
publication called Publisher's Week-
ly, a combination Bible, Koran and
Torah for booksellers, The maga-
zine looks ahead to what is com-
ing, gives short reviews and tips on
the books that are selling big all
over the country. It is strong on the
college market, Even then a man-
ager can miss something.

A year ago the publication of the
Greening of America got by me
and I had no idea of the book until
the first printing was all gone, so I
was way behind on stocking it. But
then, Random House, the publisher,
missed it too, for they only printed
5,000 copies on the first run. It
eventually went on to sell well over
100,000 copies in hardback. Here it
was the biggest hardback seller of
the Bookstore’s history (after we
finally got our hands on some) ex-
cept, naturally, Dr. Crenshaw’s Gen-
eral Lee’s College.

The primary purpose of the Book-
store is educational—exposure to
books, In that sense we teach. Yet
the students and others spend money
here voluntarily so there is no point
in stocking books they don’t want
(or should want?). Therefore we do
a great deal of listening and keep-
ing track of what sells. We must
never be out of such books as Her-
man Hesse’s novels, ee cummings’
poetry or Friedmann’s Capitalism
and Freedom, for instance.

1972 Mock Convention Report

1005 Student Delegates Attend

State Chairmen are looking for

prospective delegates to complete
their delegations.
Exactly 1005 delegates will fill

Doremus Gymnasium when the con-
vention is graveled to order on

May 5. Co-chairmen, Mike Camp-
ilongo and Tom Gillespie point out,
however, that the duties of delegates
begin long before the formal con-
vening in May.

“Not only do the delegations have
to have a firm knowledge of Demo-

cratic trends in their state, but also
they have to set up a network of
contacts,” says Campilongo.

The state chairmen have begun
the process already, But Gillespie
adds, “This is where the delegates
themselves come into play, so that
on the fifth or sixth ballot, each of
the delegations will have some idea
how they should vote.

The aim of the Mock Convention
is to predict the Democratic nomi-
nee for President. Both Co-chair-

 

Traditional Parade Stars
Cl ydesdales, Beauty Queen

BY BILL ANDREWS

The Mock Cenvention parade is
perhaps the most festive tradition
of the entire phenomenon. This
year the parade will begin at noon
on Friday, May 5.

In past years, the parade has
heen covered by state newspapers
und television stations as well as the
major wire services. We expect the
same co-operation with the media
this year

Among the ninty units anticipated
to march down Main street will be
the Budwieser “Clydesdales” and a
float bearing Miss Virginia. (Any
body know of an empty stable’...
for the horses, not Miss Virginia.)
Each of the state delegations is ¢x
pected to enter a unit in the parade

There will also be individual
floats representing the major con
tenders for the Democratic nomina
tion. In addition, the Mock Conven-
tion parade committee anticipates
several maching bands including
local high school bands, and the
‘Highty

lighties” of Virginia Tech

will invade V.M.1.’s home town.

The surrounding women's col-
leges are reportedly entering units
for this years parade. And, of
course, there will be clowns and
political figures. (Only discriminat-
ing parade views will be able to dis-
tinguish between them.)

The parade will begin at the Lex-
ington High School field. From
there the procession follows Main
Street until it intersects with Wash-
ington Street. The parade turns
down Washington and passes by the
reviewing stand near President
Huntley's house.

Cash prizes will be awarded to
the best entries. The judging will be
done by the assistant parade chat
men or their representatives.

The assistant parade chairmen
include Tommy VanAmburgh, Bill
Wallace, Paul Perkins, George
Wolfe, Craig Fines, John Folsom,
Bliss Hickey, Smitty Smith, Larry
Dunkle (custodian of the standard
bearing Donkey), and Don Cart
wright

men point out that the convention
does not necessarily reflect student
political views, but the nation as a
whole.

“Not only will the delegates par-
ticipate in the casting of votes on
the convention floor, but also in de-
signing and building floats for the
parade down Main Street,” says
Gillespie.

When queried as to who are elig-
ible to become delegates, Campilon-
go responded, “Of course all W&L
students and their wives, transfer
students, and we hope to find some
delegates from the surrounding
women’s colleges.

Why 1005? “I’m glad you asked
that,” replied Campilongo,” the
Mock Convention is actually a one
third scale reproduction of the na-
tional convention, so we divide the
number of delegates by a third and
come out with 1005.”

The delegations are not yet full
according to Gillespie, “The state
chairmen are trying to contact every
student to interest them in their
delegations.”

“Any student wishing more in-
formation or desiring to join a dele
gation can contact either Mike, ot
myself, or any of the state chair
men.”

be published one week following the
convention to record the outcome
of the two day affair, The supple
ment will also be available to stu
dents, politicians and advertisers.

Advertising is being solicited by
each of the state delegations. Ad-
vertisers include not only Lexington

Roundballers Defeat Tritons,
Wasps; Rhode Island U. Next

PALMER TRICE
nls the glory days have fin-
Ihe Generals finally put
together two good games in a row.
Wednesday night the Blue traveled
to Emory and Henry, where they
took on the home standing Wasps.
Ihe Wasps are always tenacious at
home, but the Washington and Lee
hoopers simply overwhelmed them
with good, basic basketball. Led by
Mike Daniel's career high of 37
points, the visiting Generals march-
ed to a 93-72 triumph, perhaps their
most impressive of the year.

[he Blue put forth an outstand
ing team effort. Aside from Daniel's
sterling performance, Paul McClure
put together his best game of the

ally come

season. McClure was good for 15
points, 12 rebounds, and six blocked
shots. He dominated the inside
game, intimidating the Wasp attack
Charlie Strain, who had 8 points
and 5S asists. “played his usual good
floor game, directing traffic on of
lense and defense.” Coach Canfield
also said that he got another good
game from Doug Clelan. Pre-game

strategy called for the Generals to
run from the moment of the open-
ine tip-off, and run they did. The

ington on Saturday night. They left
feeling like a fish out of water, com-
ing out on the short end of an 81-72
decision. The game was a momentu-

ous one. Mike Daniel took over
fitth place in the all-time list of
WAL scorers. His 27 points gave

him a total of 1,294, five more than
recent star Mike Neer. For the
first time, the Blue put together a
sound game on their home floor.
The margin could have been more,
as the Generals led by 17 at the
half, 42-25. With a nine point lead,
and 14:42 remaining in the game,
Coach Canfield displayed his confi-
dence in his bench by substituting
his first five with five from the
bench. Much like Dean Smith's Tar
Heels did in a_ similar position

against Virginia, the reserves held
their own. Florida Presbyterian was
unable to capitalize, and the Gen-

erals coasted for the rest of the ball
game

Lexington was the middle stop
for the Tritons on their northern
trip. They also took on Franklin and

Marshall College and St. Andrews
College. The Tritons had the mis
fortune of running into Skip Licht

fuss’ best game of the year. Skip hit
on 10 of 18 shots from the floor,

Blue had a good floor game. Doug
Clelan highlighted it, as he con-
nected for 8 assists. The Generals
also outrebounded the visitors.

As a prelude to the Florida Pres-
byterian contest, the W&L frosh-
entertained Massanutten Military
Academy. With their 91-75 victory,
the freshmen boosted their record to
4-2. The team is an exceptional one.
Stu Nibley is an exceptional guard,

In Scoring

Senior .captain. Mike. Daniel. has
been giving record-setting perfor-
mances lately, and the Washington
and Lee basketball Generals will
need more of them in a pair of
tough games coming up this week.

Last week Daniel scored 37 points
against Emory and Henry and 27
against Florida Presbyterian, both
Generals’ victories, to raise his sea-
son average to 23.6 points a game.
He also passed Mike Neer on the
all-time scoring list and now ranks
fifth with 1,294° career points,

At his present pace, Daniel could
easily rise to fourth on the all-time
list, just behind Mel Cartwright.
The all-time top scorers are Dom

Flora 2,310, Jay Handlan 2,002,
Cartwright 1,800, Lee Marshall

Others. who have scored ovet

Both played just three years.

The Generals will need as many
of those record-pacing points as
they can get against opponents
Rhode- Island College and Baltimore
Loyola. W&L plays Rhode Island
at home Friday night (8 p.m.), fol-
lowed by the away game in Balti-
more Saturday night.

At last report, Rhode Island
boasted a 9-3 record, was averaging
over 100 points a game, and ranked
fourth nationally in shooting accur-
acy. Their big gun, 6-3 Ricky Wil-
son, is averaging over 26 points a
game and was a second team All-
American selection last year.

Baltimore Loyola, with a 7-6 rec-
ord, has everyone back from last
years Mason-Dixon Conference
championship team, and is always
tough at home.

To top off the hectic week, the
Generals get very little rest before
entertaining Bridgewater at home
next Monday night. That will be
three games in four nights.

The W&L freshmen, now 4-2 on
the year, will play 6 p.m. prelimi-
nary games prior to the Rhode Is-
land and Bridgewater games. The
opposition. will be the VMI Rats
Friday night, and the Bridgewater
frosh Monday night.

downed West Virginia Wesleyan,
62-49, last week, raising their sea-

son mark to 3-1, but face potent
Johns Hopkins and VMI this week.

In the medley relay, the team of
Harris, McCain, Lawlor, and How-
ard captured a first, as did Steve
Johnson in the 1000 freestyle and
Alan Corwith in the 200 freestyle
Freshman Wilt Brotherton captured
the 400 MI. while Senior Bert Meem
ran away with the 200 fly. Clark
and Barber swept 1-2 in both the
100 and SO freestyle, and John Law-
low took first in the 500 free. Harris

added a third in the 200 backstroke
as did Rick McCain in the 200

LaRue’s Pressbox g,

Future of W&L Athletics

Last December I hired a swami
to look into his crystal ball to tell
me what was going to happen at (or
to) Washington and Lee, particular-
ly among the Athletic Department,
during the first six months of 1972.
This would have been printed earl-
ier, except my prognosticator could
not find my address, So here goes.

In January, Bowie Kuhn_ hires
Jim Bouton as pro baseball's Num-
ber One public relations man in or-
der to offset the effects of the Rozelle
Poll which claimed football to be
the nation’s favorite sport. Immedi-
ately, Bouton collaborates with his
assistant John Hughes in an inter-
view with W&L coach Joe Lyles,
the result of which is to vault the
National Pasttime into the fore-
front and Lyles into prominence as
baseball’s next Casey Stengle (watch
for this one sometime this week).

In February, W&L wrestling
coach John Piper, constantly kidded
about his boyish looks, goes on a
crash diet, loses forty pounds, and
enters himself as a W&L partici-
pant in the 180 pound class. But he
gets pinned anyway.

Among the first in. a series of
many shake-ups in the W&L Athletic
Department comes the March an-
nouncement by Athletic Director
William McHenry that Dick Miller
will replace Buck Leslie as head
football coach, Miller’s first move
as headcoach is to order fifty dozen
pairs of white socks. His second
move is to be late for his first pre-
season practice because there are
no clocks in the gym.

Meanwhile, in his spare time,
Murph has been working on a secret
formula which stimulates the rapid
growth of human hair. First to try
it is swim coach Bill Stearns, who,

 

 

with his new ornament, achieves
self-confidence and throws away his
copy of How To Pick Up Girls.

In Apirl, golf coach Cy Twombly
moves over to lead W&L’s formed
water-skiing team. Coach Norman
Lord replaces Twombly and im-
mediately starts to get his golfers in
shape by making them run up House
Mountain.

Also that month, trainer Tom
Jones is hired as the University
Physician, and Kelly Buell is recom-
mended as his replacement.

In May, the W&L Courses and
Degrees Committee approves P.E.
305, 306, and 307 (Skills in Base-
ball, Basketball, and Football Tri-
via) for the 1972-3 year, in response
to the First Annual W&L Sports
Trivia Contest, held in April when
everybody has nothing else to do.

Meanwhile, coach Dick Szlasa
becomes the backfield coach under
Miller and immediately installs the
Wishbone-T with Ed Kowal as the
option man, Dean Farrar is hired as
the lacrosse coach .

To the Editor

(Continued from page 2)
one which must be resisted at all
cost,

None of the justifications thus far
extended can even overcome the de-
sirability of our present and tra-
ditional position, much less cope
with the dangers—expansion, loss of
revenue, and potential damage to
the athletic and fraternity situation
among them—which  coeducation
promises, There simply is no case.

Lee: A Non-Person?
lo the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

It was commendable of The Ring-
tum Phi to have remembered the
birthday and contributions of a liv-
ing member of the Washington and
Lee family. It is with some regret,
however, that it must be noted that
the birthday of a spiritual contribu-
tor to the heritage of our university
was forgotten. Has R. E. Lee be-
come a non-person?

Mrs. Munger Outlines:
How Books Are Chosen

For The W@L Bookstore

(Continued from page 2)

We watch special orders care-
fully and when there have been two
or three for a particular book we
get it for the shelves. The sudden
flash of a best seller like Love Story
keeps us trying to guess how long it
will last and should we order 20 or
50 copies more? After selling 125
copies in 3 months we have not
sold a single copy of Love Story
since July. So it goes, as Vonnegut
says in Slaughter House Five.

It is inevitable that a Bookstore
takes on to some extent the Char-
acter and interests of the book buy-
er. This must be guarded against but
can also be used. The range of en-
thusiasms of the person who makes
the decisions can expand horizons,
and dimensions to a student's inter-
ests and even a light touch at times.
However, the radar of the manager
has to be finely tuned or we find
ourselves way off the main track.
The Bookstore stock must be a bal-
anced one and we welcome people
into the act.

Each year seems to be different,
This year the range of concerns is
more diffuse, less concentrated and
activist, And yet we have never been
as challenged by the variety of sub-
jects which people are delving into.
The diversity of curiosity keeps us
jumping—with, of course, more
chances for not making the right
selections. Unhappiness is not hav-
ing a book that is asked for or be-
ing scared when the prices go up.
One thing for sure, tomorrow won't
be like yesterday, and today in the
Bookstore is never dull.

ally changed over the years: “If
there is something radically differ-
ent in this generation that would
make the Honor System inapplic-
able now or ineffective now, what
is it that has changed? | think the
burden of evidence then would have
to be on the students themselves
who want the changes to come.”

It is the hope of the study group
that in the course of its examina-
tion of the Honor System it will
gather as many different opinions
and observations as possible. The
aim is to be objective, and to arrive
at valid conclusions from honest in-
vestigation. The two men interview-
ed this week certainly have contri-
buted to the study; and it is also
hoped that the study will encompass
the ideas of the students of whom
Dr. Leyburn spoke, those “who
want the changes to come.” The re-
sults of these interviews will con-
tinue to be reported (or at least
sketched) weekly in the Ring-tum
Phi; whether any satisfactory con-
clusions will be reached remains, of
course, to be seen.

doubts and fears”, said Lee Kahn,
drama professor and Troub direc-
tor. “This is what we're trying to
work for in this production.”

Excerpts from Luther were staged
last October at R. E. Lee Memorial
Episcopal Church. Mr. Kahn said
the abbreviated version emphasized
Luther's preaching but did not deal
sufficiently with Martin Luther as a
human being. The conflict between
Luther and his father also was not
dealt with.

Luther is only one of several
plays by John Osborne. The English
playwright is perhaps best known
for Leok Back in Anger, written in
1957. His other plays include Hotel
in Amsterdam and Inadmissable
Evidence.

University Federation Asks
Volunteers For Programs

The University Federation is still alive and it needs volunteers for its

activities,

There are still kids in town who need a “Big Brother” or “Big Sister”
to whom they can look up to and respect not only as an older person but
also as a friend. Volunteers are needed for this program.

Tutors are needed at a school in Lexington called Central School.

Volunteers are needed to go to Chatham Nursing Home to visit with the
old folks and hopefully brighten their day.

Students are needed at Western State Mental Hospital in Staunton to
help the patients out, That place is like a jail to some people.

Students are needed to help the handicapped children of Rockbridge
County overcome their psychological handicaps.

The University Federation needs volunteers.

Congressman Robinson Presents
Legislative Action Program

BY PAUL LANCASTER

Congressman J. Kenneth Robin-
son, representing the seevnth dis-
trict of Virginia, emphasized in a
speech here last Thursday that the
future military budget of America
will be based on “what we will need
for the safety of the country, and
what it will cost.”

The congressman, brought here
by the College Republicans, cited
three reasons for an increase in mili-
tary spending this year—‘inflation
.. . proliferation of tensions in the
world .. . and the limited hopes” of
the people of the world in general.

Robinson, serving his first term in
the House of Representatives, noted
a myriad of problems limiting the
cutback of defense spending. Among
these were the inadequacies of our
present arsenal, the need for devel-
opment of the greatest possible sec-
urity system with the smallest
amount of manpower, and the at-
tempt to draw high quality per-

Evidently, due to the fast-paced life
he leads, that formula works well
for him. Since his departure after
two years at Washington and Lee,
Labro has returned to the United

States a total of twenty-six times.

The premiere is scheduled for
7:30 p.m. at the State Theatre with
a possible second showing at 10:00
p.m. for those unable to be accom-
modated by the 690 seat capacity of
the theatre. Labro will speak after
the first screening, answering any
questions the audience might have
concerning the film.

sonnel into the military with high
pay.

He stated that the Navy would
get the most consideration this year
in the budget. The representative
said we must increase our weapons
technology in the Navy to “prevent
the Indian Ocean from becoming a
Russian lake this fall,”

Robinson summed up his discus-
sion of the military budget by de-
claring that “defense spending is
going to get a close look by Con-
gress this year.”

The Congressman then presented
a “laundry list of concerns” coming
up before Congress this year be-
fore concluding his talk with a brief
question-an-answer period. Among
the items on his list:

—an increase in social security bene-
fits of about five percent.
—welfare reform, at least “hope-
fully . . . it’s presently a mess, a
total mess.” Included with this would
be a possible guaranteed annual
wage.

— increased expansion of water pol-
lution control,

—consideration for an increased
minimum wage.
tightened enforcement against

racial discrimination in hiring.
——consumer legislation, particularly
to enforce product warranties,
—consideration on a national health
insurance program.

——a look at reorganizing the execu-
tive branch of the government.

Leyburn Cited
At Ceremony

Dr. James G. Leyburn, Professor
of Sociology, who will retire after
the current academic year, was
honored in a brief ceremony during
the opening of an African art ex-
hibition on Thursday afternoon in
the Bookstore.

President Robert E, R. Huntley
spoke shortly to express his gratitude
for the contributions made by Ley-
burn to the life of the school and
the inspiration he provided to count-
less numbers of students. During
Leyburn’s second year at WAL.
Huntley had been enrolled in one
of his courses, so he said he spoke
with the experience of a student
also,

Earlier Mr. James E. Loesel, In
siructor in Politics had given a
brief background description of the
various examples of sculpture,
woodwork, painting, and clothwork.
The majority of art objects came
from East African nations. Dr, Ley-
burn then gave a short speech on
art and its relation to African soc
rely

Glenn Azuma questioned whether
or not an EC appropriation would
be proper if spent toward the Pavi-
lion party which the club has plan-
ned for the visiting teams.

The request was tabled until
February 4, when the Rugby club
can present an itemized breakdown
of their expenses.

The same action was taken on a
request by Bob Ford, on behalf of
the Student Association for Black
Unity (SABU), for $200 to bring
the LC, Norecom High School choir
from Portsmouth for a concert dur-
ing SABU's upcoming Black Cul-
ture Week. Ford said that the choir
would present a program of “Black
Music Through the Ages” on March
2 in Lee Chapel.

This request was also tabled until
Ford may present a breakdown of
the choir's expenses at next week's
meeting.

EC meetings will henceforth
start at 7:30 p.m, instead of 7 p.m.
