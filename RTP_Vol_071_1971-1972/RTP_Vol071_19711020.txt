Chambers Brothers Highlight Weekend

Highlighting the upcoming week-
end will be a Homecoming football
contest, a Red Square cocktail

party, and the concert appearance of
the Chambers Brothers at Doremus
Gymnasium on Saturday night. This
will be the first area performance

by the group since their sellout con-
cert at the University of Virginia
two years ago,

The afternoon activities will begin
with the game, beginning at 2 p.m.
on Wilson Field, between Washing-
ton and Lee and Western Maryland.

This will be followed with a grain
party in Red Square (no one who
does not possess a card signifying
his payment of class dues will be
served).

The Chambers Brothers are prob-
ably best known for their recording

A delegation of 16 seniors has
recently been selected to represent
Washington and Lee University in
“Who's Who Among Students in

Their concert will be held in Dore-

ginning with Gordon Lightfoot on
November 20, will be held in the
new gym. There will be no seats, so
bring a blanket and some pillows.

Senator Spong To Speak

Senator William B. Spong of Vir-
ginia will deliver the fall keynote
address for the 1972 Mock Conven-
tion in Lee Chapel at 8 p.m. next
Monday, October 25. Senator Spong
will be speaking on the subject of
Democratic politics in the coming
decade. Because of the diversity of
assignments given him in the USS.
Senate he is highly qualified to speak
on the topic.

Although he has been in the Sen-
ate for a litthke more than four years,
he has just been seated on the pres-
tigious Foreign Relations Commit-
tee. The only other Democrat nam-
ed to the Committee in this Congress
was third-term Senator Edmund S.
Muskie of Maine. Spong is also a
member of the Commerce Com-
mittee. Earlier this year the Senator
was named to fill the seat of retiring
Senator Eugene McCarthy on the
Select Committee on Standards and
Conduct. This was recognition of his
continuous efforts in the area of eth-
ics of elected officials. He has spon-
sored legislation in every Congress
since 1967 to require full public dis-
closure of assets and liabilities.

Senator Spong has voluntarily
made such disclosures each year
since he entered the Senate. He has
also advocated similar disclosures of
the sources of campaign financing.
The Senator also serves on the Mon-
dale Select Committee on Educa-
tion and the influential Democratic
Steering Committee of the Senate.

Spong’s brief Senate career has
often involved him in controversy.
In 1969 when Senator George Mc-
Govern was dramatizing the prob-
lem of hunger in America, Spong
made a series of trips through his
own state to investigate the impact
and efficacy of existing programs.

Initial editorial reaction was un-
favorable to his tour, but Spong
completed it as planned and uncov-
ered the fact that many people elig-
ible for existing programs has either
been left unaware of their availabil-
ity or lacked sufficient training in
nutrition to make use of the food
provided. His personal intervention

here made the programs more effec-
tive while eliminating some misun-
derstandings about the problem of
hunger and the approaches to its
solution.

There has been some speculation
on Spong as a possibility for the
Supreme Court. Spong has not en-
couraged this speculation, but his
own votes on nominees to the High
Court have focused attention on him
in recent years when the Court has
been a public issue,

Senator Spong is a native of Ports-
mouth. He is a graduate of Hamp-
den-Sydney College and the Univer-
sity of Virginia Law School.

OUTLOOK andREVIEW |

October 20, 1971

During the Special Alumni Conference last weekend, stu-
dents and administrators stressed the need for alumni sup-
port to Washington and Lee. Two specific types of support
were emphasized: reeruitment and financial.

Dean of Students, Lewis John, explained the key role that
alumni play in attracting superior students to W&L,. Accord-
ing to the dean, more current W&L freshmen learned about
this institution through alumni contacts than any other means.
Therefore, alumni were continually informed last weekend
that their recruiting efforts would be a great boon to the
university.

Perhaps a more obvious type of alumni support Washing-
ton and Lee University seeks is donations. Alumni Fund gifts
constituted 6.64 per cent of the educational and general ex-
penses incurred during the 1970-1971 fiscal year. Washington
and Lee simply could not balance its budget without alumni
help.

After the alumni heard this two-fold plea for support from
their alma mater, the W&L graduates countered with their
own two-fold plea to the students. First, the alumni expressed
growing concern over the possible decline in the spirit of
W&L. They pointed to the diminishing esteem of certain tra-
ditions: conventional dress, the speaking tradition, and the
Fancy Dress Ball. Second, alumni suggested that students per-
sonally help defray the cost of their education along these
lines. A unique idea was fostered by Robert P. Smith Jr. of
Jacksonville, Florida, and a member of the class of 1954. Mr.
Smith proposed that he and other interested alumni would
match one dollar contributions made by students.

The plan makes sense. As Mr. Smith pointed out, alumni
rarely give regular donations to the university until a decade
after their graduation. The result is a lag for alumni during
which they are not involved in the institution’s operation.
Getting soon-to-be-alumni into the habit of financially support-
ing W&L would help alleviate the lag.

Mike McCall, a senior on the Student Development Com-
mittee, is in charge of developing this innovative approach to
raising money. A total of nine alumni have pledged matching
funds to cover donations by most of the student body. So, we
will await the implementation of this plan. Mr. MeCall ap-
parently must overcome only minor logistic problems to fulfill
Mr. Smith’s idea,

Parietals. The subject must be getting a little dated to the
W&L administrators. However, parietal regulations seem
equally dated to dormitory residents who must live under
them.

A few recent occurences should have direct effeet on this
unsettled issue of having or not having female visitation in
the dorms. The dormitory counselors, at the urging of coor-
dinator of the freshman year, William Schildt, have met con-
cerning parictals. The counselors are attempting to present a
written consensus of their views to both the Student Affairs
Committee and the University Council, The desire of the coun-
selors is to present a fair picture of the current status of
parietals in the dorms to the bodies that govern student af-
fairs.

In addition a newly elected freshman representative will
take part in the next University Council session. Inherently,
freshmen are the students most directly affected by dormitory
regulations. It is hoped that this elected individual will pre-
sent to the council the views of his peers, the members of the
class of ‘75,

What these two occurences mean is that more debate de-
joth the SAC and the Uni-
versity Council will convene tomorrow. Neither group plans to

serves to be heard on this issue.

discuss parietals or more correctly, stated, neither has debate
concerning parietals on the agenda.

This course of action would disregard the previously men
tioned developments. At the very least the dormitory coun
selors should be heard. After all, according to published
criteria for dorm counselor selection, these “positions are con-
sidered to be the most responsible entrusted to Washington
and Lee students.” Such a group of responsible men plus duly
elected officials of the freshman class, should be allowed to
present their cases.

Some think parietals are not an issue any more. Yet, the
issue cannot rationally be settled until those directly affected
express their criticisms and praises of the existing parieta!

University Federation Offers
Variety Of Volunteer Activities

BY DOUG McNEEL

Ever get the feeling that this old
world is turning sour with bitterness,
cynicism and despondency? There
are some people who need warmth,
tenderness, respect and __ interest.
They can do without the bitterness,
cynicism and defeatism. Consider
the physically handicapped, the men-
tally ill, those bordering on juvenile
delinquency and the old. These peo-
ple can’t afford to let ugliness creep
into their lives. They need hope to
be able to cope with their problems.
They need help from people like
you.

The popular song “You've Got To
Try A Little Kindness” points up
the problem and its solution. Some
are “standing by the road with a
heavy load” while others are “fall-
ing by the way”. These are people
who need and want your help.

The University Federation is a
community service organization de-
signed to involve students in meet-
ing the problems of the community-
problems such as mental illness, juv-
enile delinquency, physical handi-
caps and the isolation of the old.
These are very human problems
which will always be with us. Just
because these problems won't be
licked 100% does not mean that it
is futile to work towards a better
situation. On an_ individual level,
someone might work his way out of
a mental institution, someone might
learn to accept his or her physical
handicaps, someone might decide to
get out and stay out of the rut of
juvenile delinquency and someone
whose body has atrophied might
come to feel young at heart. Even
though a problem is not totally solv-
ed, even though we do not and shall
not ever live in an ideal world, you
can lend a helping hand to someone
and make his world a little nicer.

One of the opportunities for this is
volunteer work which the University
Federation is sponsoring. There are
six volunteer programs outlined be-
low which you are welcome to take
part in.

Old Folk Homes

Picture a house of old people who
have little to look forward to in
life. At the front of the room sits a

television which is almost constantly
on. The people in the room stare
blankly into the distance. Some are
even looking at the television and
possibly some are actually interested
in the program. There is little con-
versation and of course nothing to
talk about. There are old folk homes
like this all over the country.

The University Federation is fund-
ing the visits which Washington and
Lee and Sweetbriar students are
making to the State District Home
for the Aged in Chatham, Virginia.
Once a month students talk and
joke with the people who live at
Chatham House. The visit to Chat-
ham not only brightens the lives of
the folks there, but it can also be
rewarding to the visitor.

If you would like to visit the folks
at Chatham, please contact Tim
Bookas at 463-2914,

Western State Program

How would you like to be com-
mitted to a mental institution? Ever
thought about what it would be like?

Thirty-five miles north of here is a
state supported mental hospital,
Western State, in Staunton, It has
been allocated a lot of money for
material resources. It has a nice re-
creation center with pool tables,
ping pong tables, a basketball court,
a stage and a coffee shop. But, for
some reason, Western State is not
sufficiently staffed. Manpower is the
big need. Many patients who need
psychiatric help or attention are
stuck in Western State without ade-
quate professional help. One psy-
chiatrist, to my knowledge, is re-
sponsible for 200 patients. Seeing
one patient a day, every day, this
psychiatrist would be able to attend
to all of her patients once in a little
over half a year's time.

The burden of helping the pati-
ents rests on the shoulders of volun-
teers and that means you. Students
from Washington and Lee are going
up to Western State on a weekly bas-
is, spending fro mone to two hours
talking, playing football and just
plain horsing around with patients
who need, want and appreciate help.

You don't need to know anything
about psychology to participate in
this program. What we have tried to

do in the past is to have a good time
with the patients in the hope that
this may somehow help them. Al-
ways, you. must be ready to talk
seriously with the patient whenever
he has something pressing to say,

To get involved in this program,
give Michael Edwards a call. His
office answers with a tape recording
machine when he is not in so in that
case, state your. wish, give your
dorm, room number, telephone num-
ber and day or days when you
would best be able to work at Wes-
tern State. If you can go Sunday,
there is a car which leaves here at
1:00 p.m. and returns by 5:00 p.m.
Just show up in front of the Cockpit
at 1:00.

Tutoring Slow Learners

The Central School tutoring pro-
gram is the latest volunteer effort
undertaken by the University Fed-
eration. It is a joint school effort,
utilizing volunteers from both South-
ern Seminary and Washington and
Lee. The majority of those to be tu-
tored are slow learners. The pro-
gram involves tutoring on a one-to-
one basis for an hour a week. All
those interested should contact Bob
Pilling (463-6003) or Bob Foley
(463-6268).

Big Brothers-Big Sisters

The Rockbridge County Welfare
and Probation Offices have supplied
the University Federation with a list
of youngsters, most of whom have
committed very minor offenses, who
might need an older friend to pro-
vide guidance and stability in their
lives. Hopefully the influence of a
Big Brother or Big Sister would en-
courage this person to stay out of
juvenile delinquency.

The ages of the young people
range from 8-14. The Big
Brother or Big Sister must spend at
least three hours a week with the
youngster. Activities include playing
football or basketball with the boys
or even helping them on homework.
The common denominator, though,
is friendship with the model of an
older brother or older sister.

The program is designed to be
open-ended. The Big Brother or Big

The “Star Of America” Rises

BY J. HAGOOD ELLISON

If honesty is indeed the best pol-
icy, then certainly the Lexington
community is witnessing one of the
greatest wholesale public relations
campaigns for human morals, with
the advent of “The Star of Ameri-
ca.” This monthly newspaper incor-
porates the small town style of
numerous one-man papers but is
preaching the gospel to an interna-
tional audience.

It has already raised many eye-
brows and will, with a litle help,
raise a lot more if its editor and pub-
lisher, Dr. Edwin Pleasants con-
tinues his work. Pleasants, a former
college professor, sees the “Star” as
a “substitute for teaching”; his hopes
to impart an “honest influence either

 

Dr. Fdwin Pleasants

editor of “The

in the classroom or through the
paper” can be readily seen upon
quick persual of the first three edi-
tions.

The thin, graying professor in-
tends to “restore and enrich honor
in order to work in academic free-
dom.” Lexington is the headquarters
but his proposed scope calls for glo-
bal circulation. He hopes that by
drawing on the examples of several
prominent educators, notably Lee
and Washington. he can spread his
doctrine.

Dr. Pleasants. a 1942 graduate of
U.Va.. holds MA and Ph.D. de
grees in Spanish, has written one
Spanish novel and translated an-
other, and has taught at his alma
mater, as well as the Rutgers and

Sta of \merka”™

Columbia University. He has also
taught in Peru and Venezuela.

Regardless of one’s opinion, the
“Star of America” is a totally difl-
erent piece of journalism on the
Lexington scene. It combines rec-
ord and book reviews, Mom's apple
pie and the editor's own diary of
Dixie, all with a coating of the
honor code.

Where does the 50-year-old author
editor-publisher stand politically?
Reading his paper would only con-
fuse you, but he is eager to point out
he is “definitely a write-in candidate
for Lieutenant-Governor of Vir-
ginia.” His platform? You guessed
it—"“The Star of America.”

If you are not taking the first few
issues at full stock, Dr. Pleasants
notes that at least some people are.
Copies have been mailed to all Vir-
ginia congressmen, both senators
Gov. Holton, and a conglomeration
of notables including President Nix-
en. Emperor Hirohito of Japan and
Prince Charles of England.

When questioned as to President
Nixon's capabilities as a national
leader, Pleasants labeled the Chief
Executive “half-crook and half-try-
ing to reform. Like Lincoin, he is
weak on the honor code.”

With quick eyes refleciing a hyper
active mind that refuses to hold back
any opinions. the editor rapped out
at Women's Liberation, calling i a

casionally there are group outings
involving all of the participants in
the program.

If you are interested in this pro-
gram, please contact Bob Foley.

Handicapped Helped

Within Rockbridge County there
may be from 100 to 150 handicap-
ped children. This includes the deaf,
blind, physically handicapped and
children with speech impediments.
These children not only suffer physi-
cally from their handicaps but some
also suffer from mental blocs or psy-
chological problems.

A program is being established to
ease any psychological problems
which any of these children might
have. The University Federation is
funding a _ recreational program
which will give these children an
opportunity to get out and go places,
to develop their abilities and per-
sonalities, to establish friendships
and to have fun being themselves.

Volunteers are needed for this
program. If you are interested in do-
ing some work, you must take three
one hour training courses which will
be held sometime in the evenings
next week. The program will get un-
der way the first week in November
when training has been completed.
Call Ben Smith at 261-3601 if you
are interested.

Training School-Hospital

There are three general categories
of people who are mentally retarded:
those who cannot be helped, the
trainable, and the educable. In Lyn-
chburg, Virginia there is a Training
School and Hospital for those peo-
ple. The hospital is now overcrowd-
ed with 3000 patients, most of whom
are children. The goal of the hospi-
tal is to get the patients self-reliant
enough to leave the hospital and to
“go out into the world.”

There are work opportunities de-
signed specifically for these people
so that the patient will not be totally
lost when he gets into the main-
stream of society. Organizations such
as Goodwill Industries and the Sal-
vation Army are equipped to give
jobs to people who need some sort
of sheltered working conditions.

As was mentioned before there
are three general categories of pati-
ents. The ones with promise of im-
provement are the trainable and the
educable. A trainable person is one
who can learn to do some routine
physical task successfully such as an
assembly line-type jobs. The educ-
able person is capable of that and
also has the potential to learn to

Army Graphologist Evaluates Personality
By Analyzing Samples Of Handwriting ©

Reprinted from the October 8, 1971
edition of The Voice.

According to the men in Company
R, 3rd Battalion, Quartermaster
School Brigade at Ft. Lee, Va., who
work with PFC Stephen M. Sturm,
a word to the wise is—‘type.”

Private Sturm, a company clerk,
is an expert in graphology—the sci-
ence of handwriting analysis. By
looking at a person’s handwriting he
can delve into his personality.

Private Kelsey explained the sci-

handwritings are alike, just as no
two fingerprints are identical.

“In an attempt to evaluate the
personality from handwriting, many
studies have been conducted in
which script was analyzed into its
component elements. Each of those
elements has a specific meaning, not
only by itself, but first of all, in
correlation with other factors, There
are times when one feature may in-
dicate different personality traits and
this is when one considers this stroke

 

 

in relation to other features,
“For example,” he continued, “by

ence, “Graphology teaches _ that
everybody writes differently. No two

itself, wide handwriting means that
the writer is an extrovert and is soci-
able. It can also mean restlessness,
flight from one’s problems, morbid
curiosity and neurotic need for af-
fection, Thus it is as always impor-
tant to remember that a single fea-
ture can never be evaluated alone,

To test his ability, Private Sturm
was given two samples written by a
Civil War general—one written be-
fore and the other after the war.
Private Sturm knew only that the
man lived during the Civil War era,
nothing more.

He analyzed, “Here was a far-
sighted, practical man with a spirit
of enterprise that I’m sure aided him
in whatever his endeavors were.
There was a dynamic impulse in him
combined with strong ambition and
determination to help him get what
he wanted. In fact, this is probably
his strongest characteristic. He was
fortunate enough to have the intel-
lect and mental mobility as impor-
tant means to his ends, as well as the
capacity for depth of thoughts and
abstract thinking.

“He was easily adaptable to cir-
cumstances so that in times of dras-
tic change, or perhaps when faced
with fierce competition, he would be
able to withstand whatever obstacles
he faced. | am sure that he was a
leader in his field, or that he at least
had the potential to have been one.

“On what | would consider his
negative side, I found that he was

slightly narrowminded — to

thoughts of others. He was not sen-
sitive, and his emotions certainly
were not flexible. He definitely did
not allow his emotions enough ex-
pression, and in fact, he repressed
his impulses instead of trying to un-
derstand and control them, This

Film Shows Horror And Reality

BY MARK McMINN

A crowd in excess of 200 saw
Tod Browning's 1932 film FREAKS
last Wednesday night in duPont
Auditorium.

Browning, an ex-vaudeville comic,
actor, scriptwriter and assistant to
D. W. Griffith, was responsible for
many of the films during the Thirties
dealing with the grotesque, two be-
ing DRACULA (1930) and MARK
OF THE VAMPIRE (1935).

In FREAKS, Browning's mani-
pulation of reality gives the viewer
a glimpse into another world where
physical reality is unimportant, The
acceptance of their condition as ex-
emplified by the freaks in the film is
contrasted with the inhumanity of
the normal people.

The prologue to the film tells the
viewer that in anscient times any
deviation from the so-called “nor-
mal” was indeed an evil omen. Here
Browning draws heavily on the code
of behavior among the freaks: “the
hurt of one is the hurt of all.” And

in this sense, the hideous yet ap-
propriate revenge upon Cleopatra,
the trapeze artist, by turning her into
a “chicken woman,” restores reality
by turning a normal person into a
freak. —

A ban of thirty years was imposed
by the censors upon FREAKS and
only in 1962 was it lifted. Yet the
film still retains a wierd brilliance
and admiration, largely because of
Browning's conception and treat-
ment of the freaks themselves.
Browning lowers his camera to the
midget level and thereby tells the
viewer that sadism and evil lie
behind the magnificent physiques of
Cleopatra and her strong arm lover.

The simple dignity and restraint
characterized by the freaks trans-
cends their distorted appearance.
Perhaps it is this concept of human-
ity and sympathy, contrasted with
the revenge gained at the end of
the film, that enables FREAKS to
hold its own as one of the truly
great horror films of all time.

On Betrayal

BY MARC SMALL

Although the middle of the last
decade was a low tide for American
conservatives, there was a strong and
vibrant hope that united us through
the horror of the Johnson years: a

throne in a glorious crusade of truth
and virtue. And lo! it came to pass,
for we waxed mighty in 1966 and
rose to victory under the Sign of
the Slippery Richard two years later.
We rejoiced at the triumph we
thought we had achieved and were
mightily pleased in our Leader,

But three years have passed under
the guiding hand—or should one say
fist?—of President Nixon, and these
have been years in which he has
drifted, slowly but steadily, to the
left. Where is the Nixon of yester-
year? The Nixon who placed prin-
ciple above victory, and so loyally
decried the failings of the Johnson
Administration during those lean
and hungry years? Where is the Nix-
on who supported free enterprise,
the Nixon who believed so much in
individual liberty? Sometime in the
past three years Nixon the States-
man died and rose again as a politi-
cian, a Republican in name alone.

The transition has been gradual:
the Nixon of laissez-faire sentiment
still lived this past winter when he
objected to Congressional action giv-
ing him the authority to impose
wage and price controls, The Nixon
of conservative bent yet survived
last fall when he displayed such
great effort to aid the campaigns of
conservative Republicans, Yet, now
this Nixon has disappeared and we
find in his place a Nixon whose only
goal is re-election in 1972, and who
will betray every principle that the

Republican Party has held in such

There’s a mad scramble for the ball during last week’s rugby match

 

Ruggers To Face U.Va.
After 10-0 Loss To H-S

Hampden-Sydney nipped the Blue
10-0 in rugby action at Sweetbriar
Sunday, before an unusually attrac-
tive audience, Although the Blue
found their efforts to score thwarted,
they managed the most effective de-
fense yet this season, holding Ham-
pden-Sydney to one try each half (H-
§ also got one of two 2-point kick-
after-try attempts).

The ruggers troubles seem to stem
from a lack of game experience an
a disunity on the field, caused by
fielding a different combination of
men each week,

But in the “B” game the Blue
fought to a scoreless tie. And al-
though the match was played pri-
marily in the vicinity of the H-S goal
line, the Blue simply couldn't get
across for a try, Due tribute must be
paid the Hampden-Sydney defense.

The beer bash following the game
carried with it an unusual clement.

 

For possibly the first time in the his-
tory of W&L rugby, not one rugger
became drunk. Fighting their way
through the mob of Sweetbriar girls
surrounding the keg to get a sip of
brew with which to dampen the
parched throat from the chick sitting
atop the keg was just too much,
Consequently, nary a rugger had a
chance to come anywhere near in-
toxication, and the Blue rose to the
singing of the traditional songs with
a hitherto unknown sobriety.

Next Sunday, the ruggers face up
against U.Va. at 2:00 P.M. on Alum-
ni Field. It’s just the game to see to
top off the “big” weekend, A big
turn out, and, who knows, although
the game is billed by some as the
rugby counterpart of the Bucknell
football game, yes, who knows, the
Blue may get back in the old groove
and come up with a win.

Pari-Mutual Gambling

Lately, a commission made up of
several Virginia citizens appointed by
Governor Linwood Holton has been
exploring the possibilities of pari-
mutual gambling in this state. Natur-
ally, as with any political war, the
state has divided into two basic fac-
tions, not surprisingly known as the
pros and the cons.

It is not known to what extent the
gambling system shall be utilized.
Pari-mutual wagering consists of the
division of the winnings among those
who bet on the winner, with a per-
centage taken out of the gross by the
management. This form of betting is
most commonly used in horse racing
but can also be applied with equal
finesse to auto racing, football, base-
ball, basketball, and virtually any ath-
letic competition.

Proponents of the gambling system

contend that pari-mutual betting
would create a giant boost in much-
needed tax revenues, a boost which
could forestall raising other taxes.
Sources of income might be found in
licensing fees and a percentage of the
wager outlay, using the “skim-the-
ream-off the-top” concept employed
elsewhere, Those who favor the legis-
lation of betting claim that the state
should take advantage of the existing
state of affairs; the nags run in West
Virginia and Maryland, and much
Virginia money flows out of the state
and into the neighbors’ coffers. Be-
sides, the slight initial outlay would
be quickly recomponsed. In addition,
more tourist dollars might find their
way into Virginia’s treasury, especi-
ally since the weather would permit a
racing schedule as heavy as from
April to October or even into early
November.

On the other hand, many feel that
pari-mutual system is morally wrong,
a vicious wickedness which should not
penetrate into the Old Dominion.
Others argue that to allow gambling
to establish itself in the state is to
issue an engraved invitation to or-
ganized crime to operate here. The
first point is moot and subject to a
religious perspective; the second is

possible but not altogether probable.

However, an aspect of pari-mutual
betting overlooked by other states be-
fore they took the plunge should be
considered by our state’s commis-
sioners; the money that pours into
the wager system is money that might
ave been spent elsewhere. That is,
dollars which earlier were spent on
luxury items like books, a television, a
new fishing rod, or even a car will
ow be spent at the track. The subse-
vuent loss in income for the business-
man leads to increased bankruptcies,
higher unemployment, and fewer rev-
enue dollars to the state. The experi-
ence of other states is that this loss
has more than offset the gain pari-
mutual income.

Perhaps this is being mulled over
by the distinguished panel; but if pari-
mutual gambling is approved, I'm
placing my money on the probability
that next weekend will be rainy again.

CC Team Falls
In Home Meet

Washington and Lee’s Cross-Coun-
try team fell victim Saturday to
Christopher Newport College, 26-
29, dropping their record to two
wins against three losses thus far this
season.

Bill Kalal, a sophomore who has
been running the best for the team
all year, placed second in the meet
with a time of 28:41, only thirteen
seconds behind the winner, Bill Ilto
of Christopher Newport. Doug Mc-
Neel placed fourth in the meet
(29:34) with his best effort this sea-
son. Carter Glass, co-captain, finish-
ed third for the team and sixth in
the meet, followed by Harrison
Turnbull (eight) and Bob Sherwood,
also a co-captain, ninth. Each team
placed five runners in the top ten.

read, This person's stumbling block
is abstract thinking.

In order for a person to progress,
he must have some individual at-
tention and guidance. With help, a
person can learn and develop, With-
out this attention the child loses any
desire to learn and falls back into
the rut of oblivion,

The Lynchburg Training School
and Hospital is working with the
situation in the following way. They
have taken the children who have
shown the most promise, and isolat-
ed them from the other children. By
placing them in suites instead of
wards the hospital staff hopes to
make some progress. A ward is a
large open room with sometimes ten
beds in it. A suite on the other hand

usually houses about two or three
students and is more self-contained,
There are from 150-200 children
living in these suites. The hospital
wants to direct its manpower into
this area first since these are the
most promising children. Then as
these children are prepared to leave
the hospital, children from the wards
can move into the self-contained
units and hopefully be helped too.
What is needed to make this pro-
gram work is dedicated volunteers.
One member of the hospital staff
said that if Washington and Lee sent
them 1000 volunteers, he could put
them all to work immediately. Ap-
parently, there is a definite need for
more help. The volunteer would be
responsible for one child only. His
job would be to act as father, broth-

er, counselor, and most important of
all as a friend to the child.

To be effective, the volunteer must
visit his little friend at least one Sat-
urday a month, He could take him
to a movie in Lynchburg, or just
take him out for a drive in the coun-
try. If the volunteer is not constant
about going, the child, anticipating a
visit, will be depressed when he dis-
covers that his volunteer has not
come, This experience could greatly
hamper any progress the child may
have been making.

tail, 27-0. The game ended with that

score; the Generals’ never getting on

the scoreboard.

Once again, the defense did an
excellent job, even allowing 27
points, against the big and tough
Bucknell eleven. It is easy to see
that the General's major weakness
this year has been the offense, which
has managed to score only 17 points
total in its first four games. If the
Generals are to rally this year, it
will be the offense that will have to
start moving.

probably led to his not being free or
easy going around people.

“He had a certain obvious charm
about him, however, but only on the
outside, as inwardly he was cold
thinking and intuitive. I would go so
far as to say he was even deceitful at
times. He was not an impressionable
man, and he would not bend to com-
promise. This person was authori-
tarian, cautious and extremely self-
controlled, Finally, I am not sure if
he was stingy with his money and
time, or just thrifty, but there is a
distinction here and I'm not quite
sure to which way he leaned more
strongly.

“Basically this man showed a dis-
trust of others, which may have led
to the drastic change I noted in a
sample of his writing done several
years later, In his later writing, poor
health or a psychic disorder (mental
or nervous breakdown) shows, pos-
sibly due to the fact that he was
lonely, and always had been, for
true friends he wished he had but
would not allow himself to have. Or
perhaps an unfortunate incident oc-
curred and he was getting too old to
handle the impact.”

The man was Robert E. Lee.

earlier in the week in Norfolk,
where they had lost to Christo-
pher Newport; this score was
unofficial, however, since the two
teams were to run in a dual meet at
Washington and Lee Saturday. The
better showing by Washington and
Lee in Saturday’s meet could partly
be attributed to the rougher course
on W&L’s campus, which includes
more hills than Christopher New-
port is accustomed to in their Tide-
water area,

from the Nixon ranks, there is little
hope for a conservative resurrection
next year. All the hopes and ambi-
tions that Nixon symbolized to us
in the mid-sixties have turned to
ishes in our mouths, and we are
once again at the point of defeat.
Nixon is too firmly entrenched to be
unseated at the convention unless he
should blunder far more seriously
than is probable. Yet, some of our
faith is dead, and I doubt if those of
us who gave so much in the John-
son Interregnum shall again work so
hard or devote ourselves so totally
to this particular candidate. Nixon
shall win re-election, and shall con-
tinue to operate in a manner similar
to that of his first three years—but
he shall never again have the total
commitment he once had from con-
servatives, and his  prevaricating
vacillations shall gain him a second
term only at the cost of his honor
and the sanctity of his party’s prin-
ciples,
