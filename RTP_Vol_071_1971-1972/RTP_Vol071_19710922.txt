S. Robinson:
Honor Code

BY STEVE ROBINSON

By now, you have heard quite a
bit about the Honor System. Much
of what you have heard has prob-
ably confused you and might even
have caused doubts to arise in your
mind as to the system’s aims. All
that could be definitely attributed to
the Honor System was the phrase:
“A Washington and Lee student is
to conduct himself as a gentleman
in matters of honor at all times; he
is trusted, and he assumes the obli-
gation to be trustworthy.”

What does this new statement
mean? Has the Honor System been
changed? Is it no longer a breach of
the Honor Code to lie, cheat, or
steal?

 

Due to the current widespread con-
cern over the Honor System at
W&L, the Ring-tum Phi has decided
to reprint the remarks made by Stu-
dent Body President Steve Robinson
at the Opening Assembly, The text
appears here in full.—Ed.

 

To find the answers to these ques-
tions, one must delve into the his-
tory of the Honor System. The
Honor system at W&L was an un-
written rule for over a century. The
South had long espoused a concept
of gentlemanly conduct which in-
cluded honesty, So in 1867 when
Robert E. Lee, then President of
Washington College, told his stu-
dents, “we have but one rule here,
and that is that you be a gentleman,”
it was nothing more than the first
crystallization of the Washington
and Lee concept of honor.

It was in this form that the W&L
Honor System existed for over 75
years. Not until after World War Il
did the phrase “lie, cheat, or steal”
become associated with the Honor
System.

There has always been a question-
ing of the Honor System, but in-
quiry into the idea of “lie, cheat,
and steal” increased markedly in the
past few years. The Honor System
works because the students have
faith in it, not because the Execu-
tive Committee enforces it. There-
fore, if the students at W&L no
longer thought that “lie, cheat or
steal” embodied the spirit of the
Honor System, the terminology of
the Honor code had to be reviewed,
and a change was made.

There is another reason for the
change in wording; the simple
phrase, “A Washington and Lee stu-
dent will not lie, cheat, or steal” is
very definite and does not encom-
pass the thought processes used by
the members of the Executive Com-
mittee during an honor violation, A
major consideration in all hearings
is the intent of the individual in-
volved.

Due to these reasons, in the spring
of 1971 a change was made in the
written statement about the Honor
System. There were two choices (1)
A codified detailed statement listing
every type of a possible violation,
and (2) an alternative to this, a gen
eralized statement similar to the
one made by General Lee over a
century ago, The reasons for choos-
ing the latter course seem fairly ob-
vious,

This new statement does not
change the meaning of the Honor
System at all,

It is not a retreat from the
foundations of honor at WAL, On
the contrary, the new phrase allows
for more flexibility and interpreta
‘ion by both the EC and the other
members of WAL’s student body

Washington and Lee is a com
munity of trust, and by your pres
ence here you have become a part
of that community, The advantages
are many, You can go to classes
leaving your door open without fear
of someone coming in and taking
something, you can take exams with
out proctors, and you can schedule

our own final exams, But the big
eest benefit of the Honor System is
overlooked by many people—that of
having your word taken as the truth
by anyone in Lexington—a profes

or, another student, a merchant in
town

One cannot expect, however, to
reap the benefits of the Honor Sys
tiem without assuming the respon
ibilities required of a student who
lives under the system's jurisdiction

The first of these obligations is to
abide by the system's provisions and
io help perpetuate this way of life
And this brings us to the question
what is a dishonorable act?

Concert Series Debuts

The Washington and Lee Con-
cert Guild opens its 1971-72 season
on September 27 at 8:00 p.m. in
Lee Chapel with Diane Borgus, so-
prano soloist.

Miss Borgus, a native of Lexing-
ton, received a Bachelor of Music
Performance from the University of
Michigan. She has studied with Har-
old Haugh and received scholarships
throughout her four years at Michi-
gan, She sang in the University
Choir, and had principal roles in
“The Merry Widow” and “Manon.”
In addition, she has done solo work
at Zion Lutheran Church in Ann
Arbor.

She was also first runner-up at the
1970 Miss Michigan Pageant.

The program will be the one
which she sang at her graduation re-
cital, It will consist of Italian,
French, German and American art
songs, including a group by Robert
Schumann. She will conclude with
a group of spirituals, including one
by Stephen Foster,

Miss Borgus will be accompanied
by Mr. James T. Cook of the
Washington and Lee music staff,

This concert will be followed by
six others.

On Oct. 4, the Guild will present
Bernard and Naomi Zaslav, a viola

and piano duo. The Zaslov duo was
started in 1948 and has been most
active since 1961, They have per-
formed at Carnegie Hall, La Mai-
son Francais of New York Uni-
versity and Columbia University,
among others.

In addition to the established rep-
etoire they have actively promoted
new works written for them by
American composers,

Huntle

President Robert E. R. Huntley
warned Washington and Lee stu-
dents to guard against the loss of the
“community of spirit” and “esteem
for one another” that characterizes
the W&L experience. He spoke on
the occasion of the University’s tra-
ditional Opening Assembly conduct
ed last Wednesday at noon in Evans
Dining Hall.

Huntley, after welcoming the stu-
denis back to Lexington, related in
inimatable fashion some of his own
recreational activities of the past
three months—the fishing, hunting.
and summer planning. His summer
reflections led to the observation

Is Keynote Speaker

One of the South's most promi-
nent “new” Democrats, Governor
Jimmy Carter of Georgia, will de-
liver the keynote address next spring
at W&L’s 15th mock political con-
vention.

Carter, who previously held of-
fice in the Georgia State legislature,
was catapulted to the governorship
after upsetting former Governor
Carl Sanders in the primary contest
and proceeding to defeat the Repub-
lican candidate in last November's
general election. He achieved na-
tional political prominence by de-
claring in his inaugural address: “I
say to you quite frankly that the
time for racial discrimination is over.
Our people have already made this
major and difficult decision.”

Carter’s speech will follow the tra-
ditional kickoff parade through
downtown Lexington May 5, ac-
cording to the announcement issued
this week by the student chairmen
of the convention, Tom Gillespie
and Mike Campilongo.

As keynoter for the mock Presi-
dential convention proceedings, Car-
ter follows the footsteps of former
President Harry S. Truman, who de-
livered the address in 1960; former
Vice-President Alben Barkley, 1956;
former Rep. Walter Judd, 1964,
four years after keynoting the ac-
tual GOP convention, and Gov,
Claude Kirk of Florida, 1968.

“Previously we have usually tried
to get someone of long-standing
prominence to appear as keynoter,”
commented Campilongo. He pointed

that “new yardsticks” are needed to
measure the changes that are occur-
ing constantly at W&L and all over
the nation within colleges and uni-

versities. “Current literature warns
us that the day after tomorrow
every institution we have known

could be unrecognizable.”

Huntley remarked that much of
the innovation at W&L has been ob-
served through the rather unreliable
perspective of “the nostalgia phe-
nomenon, an affliction of WAL sup
porters perhaps to a greater degree
than most other institutions.”

“Washington and Lee has a way
of getting under your skin.” said

out that Carter exemplified the for-
ward-looking spirit of this year’s
convention, having “enunciated a
clear break with the old issues and
past politics.”

“He is particularly appropriate,”
continued Campilongo, “for the pur-
pose of this year’s Mock Convention
is not to imitate national politics in
its old forms, in the sense of looking
backward—but our aim is to look
ahead to anticipate the changes and
reforms which will come about in
party politics over the next four to
eight years.”

“If we were just to put on a two-
day carnival, we might as well not
have it,” Campilongo emphasized.

Carter was recently featured in a
recent issue of TIME, which explor-
ed the “new breed” of progressive
Democratic governors who were
swept into office in 1971, including
Askew of Florida, Bumpers of Ar-
kansas, and West of South Caro-
lina. “We all ran against the estab-
lishment,” Carter stated during a
recent forum in Atlanta, and most
of these contests were rated as up-
sets by political observers.

Born in Plains, Ga., where he
continues to operate his family’s cot-
ton and peanut warehouse, Carter
was graduated with distinction from
the U.S. Naval Academy, and then
served two years on battleships and
five years on submarines.

In statewide politics only since
1962, Carter made his first try for
the governorship in 1966, coming in

Huntley, and he went on to em-
phasize that the nostalgic tendency
of alumni is to remember “only the
good, tangibly indicated in customs
of dress and speaking.” “But,”
Huntley added, “the man who oc-
casionally applies his intellect to re-
call the way it really was,” may also
recognize that “a certain intangible
quality of Washington and Lee may
be drifting away.”

“A unique esteem for one another,
a self-respect, community of spirit,
gentleness, integrity . could be
lost here,” continued Huntley. The
President concluded his address by
calling on the present students of
Washington and Lee to assure “that
these intangibles will not disappear,
but that indeed they will be strength-

 

President Huntley demonstrates his fly-casting technique before audi-

third behind the winner Lester Mad-
dox. Four years later he won with
almost 60 per cent of the vote, with
Maddox elected as his Lieutenant
Governor,

Carter describes himself as a poli-
tical conservative, believing that the
“future of Georgia will be determin-
ed by leaders who believe in self-
reliance, local control, and indivi-
dual participation in government.”

Thus far the Carter administration
has witnessed its share of contro-
versy. Carter further surprised and
angered some of the old party regu-
lars with his appointment of a fel-
low “new” Democrat, David Gam-
brell, to assume the U.S. Senate seat
of the late Richard Russell. Carter
has also been in the forefront with
his programs for state governmental
reorganization and environmental
protection. All this, not to mention
the friction emanating from Lieu-
tenant Governor Maddox's office
over the control of the Georgia
Democratic party.

Nevertheless, political commenta-
tors agree that Carter will be among
the most influential Democrats at
the 1972 party convention in Miami
Beach.

In previous mock conventions,
held for the party that will challenge
the incumbent, W&L students have
been correct nine times, wrong just
four—giving them a better record at
judging the mood of the parties than
either party at judging the mood of
the voters.

ened , . . to give life and meaning to

Huntley's remarks were preceeded
by a series of introductions, recog-
nizing the new Dean of the College,
Dr. William J. Watt, and the new
Assistant Dean of the College, Dr.
Robert W. McAhren. The invocation
was offered by Dr. David W. Sprunt,
the University chaplain.

Following Huntley's address Presi-
dent of the Student Body Steve Rob-
inson called for a “mutual trust” on
the part of the students to “uphold
the heritage” of the W&L Honor
System. The teat of Mr. Robinson's
remarks appear elsewhere on this

OUTLOOK and REVIEW | Jour nalism Labor ator y Press

September 22, 1971

“SECTION 1. The right of citizens of the United States,
who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be
denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on
account of age.

“SECTION 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce
this article by appropriate legislation.”

That is the Amendment XXVI to the United States Con-
stitution, What it means is that almost all W&L students
can vote in the 1972 Presidential elections. But will the mem-
bers of the newly enfranchised under-21 set take advantage
of this Amendment?

Judging from current evidence, the answer seems to be no.

For those of you who are still unfamiliar with the proce-
dure for voting, there is a simple mandatory requisite before
you are allowed to cast a ballot. You must register to vote.
That seems to be the problem—not very many W&L men (or
women) have registered. Such a feat may be accomplished in
City Hall. However, the City Registrar, Mrs. Moore, reported
Friday evening that, “only ten W&L boys have registered
and most of them have lived in Lexington all their lives. And
not a single VMI cadet has registered.”

Last week's Ring-tum Phi carried a front page article en-
titled “W&L Men Can Vote Here”. That story explained the
details about registering to vote in this city. For the sake of
brevity, the requirements of registering can be summarized
simply :

1. residence evidenced by domicile (a require-

ment fulfilled by attending the university )

2. residence evidenced by abode
The City Registrar reported that she would decide on an in-
dividual’s fulfillment of the second requirement “by some in-
tent of staying in Lexington.” In making such a decision the
following factors would weigh heavily: whether students re-
turn home over vacations, payment of personal property taxes,
and being employed in town.

Undoubtedly, most out-of-town students remain uninter-
ested in the intricacies of Lexington and Virginia political up-
heavals. Perhaps, these gentlemen, who are here for only a
four year stay, pay greater attention to hometown politics,
somewhat in the vein of remaining relatively true to a home-
town honey. This is understandable and even laudable. But for
these individuals, the absentee ballot is their voice in local
government.

Utilization of these absentee ballots is favored by Attor-
ney General John Mitchell and others, Of course a concen-
trated, well organized electorate can dominate an election.
The slate of officeholders in Berkeley, California is ample
evidence of this possibility. Thus, townspeople might argue
that students are just passing through and actually have no
stake in Lexington’s future.

To guard against such transients controlling local elections
is a personal statement that the applicant intends to remain in
Lexington for an indefinite period. That may be a pragmatic
solution for the city, but we wonder if it is equitable? When
others are trying to gain their privilege of voting, no such
statement is needed, Everybody is not asked if they will re-
main in tow for a period greater than four years.

Enough has been said about the mechanics of registering.
More needs to be said about the motives for registering. Think
back to the summer of 1968, Thousands of youths caused tur-
moil in Chicago during the Democratic National Convention,
Many of these people had a single complaint—they had no
voice in a government that was sending them off to die in
Viet Nam. The vehicle of opposition or support of this war is
now available. Many of these individuals can protest with a
more effective tool, the vote.

In early May Washington and Lee will stage the Mock
Convention. A great number of people are engrossed in the
preparation of such an undertaking. It would be a sad com-
mentary on our student body, if a proportional number of
students did not register to vote for the real thing, the 1972
elections,

The Ring-tum Phi does not especially care where you cast
your vote. There are two previously explained options; one
is voting in Lexington and the second is casting an absentee
ballot. You alone can decide that issue,

What we do care about is that many people have struggled
in our behalf to get the privilege to vote for 18 year olds. So
kindly get off your ass, go register and vote.

During a recent visit to the jour-

struck by the notion that I was tot-
ally ignorant of how our own Ring-

other publication here at W & L is
published. In a desperate attempt to
sate my constant quest for truth
(which is probably more a matter
of meddlesome curiosity), | found

myself talking to two gentlemen who P

The men: Ed Walker and Ed

Journalism Laboratory Press. A fi-

Can Reclamation

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

The Washington and Lee Ecology
Club has begun a can reclamation
project. We would like to collect
both aluminum and non-aluminum
cans from the fraternities, individual
students, cafes, and townspeople
here in Lexington. While rush is in
progress, we are just concerned with
the fraternities.

If you are a member of a frater-
nity and would like to help us in this
project, we would appreciate it if
you would have your fraternity keep
its used beer cans separate from the
garbage. We would like to collect
all of the cans, aluminum and non-
aluminum, and this cannot be done
when cans are scattered randomly
through your plastic sacks of general
trash. If you could place the cans in

 

 

 

ra

  

a separate container apart from the
trash, the ecology club will be able
to collect all of the cans without
having to rummage through all of
your garbage. When enough cans
are collected, they shall be sent to
a scrap metal place in Roanoke for
reprocessing.

The Ecology Club intends to col-
lect on a regular basis during rush
on the Saturday or Sunday after the
rush date combo party. We would
really appreciate your help. Thanks.

Though A Spyglass

Although it may seem to be a
romantic figment from a long-dead
past, Washington & Lee once took
a certain amount of pride in its
academic reputation. While some
fulsome words of self-praise may
still on occasion be mouthed by
various reactionaires across campus,
those attempting to abide within the
honor code are forced to remain
mute on the subject. Has Washing-

—committed academic suicide?

For those who have came in late,
the “new” curriculum was a plan
adopted by the faculty in the Spring
of 1969 which enables students to
graduate fron W&L without taking
college-level courses in a foreign
language, to take a reduced load of
general liberal arts study, and, in
general, to replace academically
stimulating courses with inane and
often, to concur with President
Pompidou, “maladjusted” disciplines.

Should not college education be
made as difficult as possible, in or-
der to better challenge our intellects”
Should not the time and effort we
spend here be best spent in learning
the greatest possible amount and in
broadening our horizons so as to
best put this increased knowledge
into effect? Does not this slackening
of standards allow the incompetent
to clutter up the college with warm
but insensient bodies which take up
spaces that might otherwise be used
by those who desire to learn?

It does not take a detailed exami-
nation to reveal the general relaxa
tion of criteria that has taken place
in the two years since the revised
curriculum came into effect. One of
the more prominent department
heads told me last week that his
freshmen advisees were asking what

Student Body President
Discusses E.C. Plans

BY STEVE ROBINSON,
Student Body President

The year 1971-72 could be a mile-
stone for the Executive Committee
at Washington and Lee. For in addi-
tion to the normal duties of student
government and the Honor System,
this is a year in which the Executive
Committee will lessen the role of it-
self and the standing committees.

The faculty has hesitantly admitt-
ed, by the formation of the Univer-
sity Council, that students are able,
and should be allowed to play a
more significant role in the decision-
making processes of the University.
It is a great waste of time and ef-
fort for the students and faculty to
each have committees dealing with
the same subject, Several commit-
tees, such as the ones studying the
curriculum, admissions and the li-
brary, suffer from this duplicity.
However, the Faculty Curriculum
Committee is officially an ad hoc

body, despite the fact that it has
been in existence for a period of
four years, The apparent, and in my
opinion, best solution for this prob-
lem is joint student-faculty commit-
tees; not just groups on which stu-
dents have but one representative,
but committees that are equally di-
vided as to student-faculty composi-
tion.

The advantages of such member-
ship for the previously mentioned
committees is obvious. Initially, this
would eliminate the tandem opera-
tion of these organizations. Joint
committees would allow for a better
exchange of ideas between students
and faculty. This increased com-
munication would eliminate the con-
flicts of dual proposals and the prob-
lems that result from trying to re-
solve such plans, This should also
lead to better results from the indi-
viduals working in these groups.
Finally, this new plan would give
students the opportunity to be a

more vital force in Washington and
Lee’s policy-making.

However, until these ideas are
realized, the Executive Committee
will continue to serve as the focal
point for student government at
Washington and Lee. In keeping
with the attitude of last year’s Exe-
cutive Committee,
give
much autonomy as possible, in an
attempt to ease this change towards
joint student-faculty endeavors. For

hopefully, the day will come soon

when the Executive Committee and
its sub-committees will be concerned

only with the Honor System and |

Several administrators and faculty
members of Washington and Lee
University will play major roles in
state and local affairs as a result of
their elections or appointments to
significant government posts this
summer,

Dr. Charles F. Phillips, professor
of economics at W&L, has taken on
three significant positions outside
the university, Early in May of this
year Dr. Phillips was elected unop-
posed as Mayor of Lexington. He
had served as a member of City
Council since 1967.

In the same election Dr, Thomas
C. Imeson, associate professor of
chemistry at W&L, was elected to
the city council. Dr. Imeson is also
a leader in the effort to obtain a
municipal swimming pool for Lex-
ington and in the children’s break-
fast club program conducted at the
Robert E. Lee Memorial Episcopal
Church.

Both W&L faculty members were
sworn in to their positions at the
City Council meeting on July 1.

Also in May Dr. Phillips was
named to the board of the Lexing-
ton office of the First National Ex-
change Bank. In June he was elected
Chairman, for a one-year term, of
the Central Shenandoah Planning
District Committee. He moved up
from the vice chairman position by
defeating Staunton City manager
Edwin D. Martin by an 11-5 vote
with Mr. Martin abstaining.

Washington and Lee President
R.E.R. Huntley was appointed to a
special committee of the State Board
of Education last June. The three
member committee was appointed
by Preston C. Caruthers, President

find I must take issue, however,
with your front page article of the
first edition, Your headline, “W&L

to register to vote here last month
and was unsuccessful. I was able to
convince the registrar, then Mrs.

cause I had not declared my per-

not mention the fact that declara-
tion of personal property, which in
most students’ cases will amount to
their automobile, is a prerequisite to
voting registration. This is not to
slight your article, because the cause
of student voting is both an admir-
able and democratic one; however,
your piece makes it sound as if the

tennis, or volleyball. But can you
imagine the look on Coach Lord's
face when he finds he’s got a girl in
his wrestling class? And I'm willing
to bet Coach Stearns would have

The basketball court, with a seating capacity of 2,000, will be officially inaugurated with the first basketball
game against U.Va.

Doremus To Open December 1

Four months behind the projected
18-month construction timetable and
3.2 million dollars later, the new
WAL sports arena, more commonly
referred to as a gymnasium, will of-
ficially open on December 1. Al-
though certain facilities will be
ready and in use before that date,
Athletic Director Bill McHenry
foresees the W&L vs. Virginia bas-
ketball game as the opener of not
only a_ successful basketball sea-
son but also a successful gym.

A Press Day tour of the multi-
million dollar complex, conducted
by McHenry himself, revealed little
doubt that the gym would not meet
its opening. Upon entering the new
complex from the old Doremus en-
trance, one faces the basketball
court. While still located on the
same level as the old court, two
elevated landings rise on both ends
of the baskets, to be used primarily
as recreational areas and for gym-
nastics. A press level runs along the
west wall midway between the floor
and the ceiling. Rollout bleachers
line the main floor with a capacity
of just over 2,000, Additional seats
can be arranged in those elevated
areas on both ends of the court for
an added capacity of 300.

Below the court rests three and
one half floors, the first of which
houses team rooms and showers, On
this floor and also the one beneath
it are eight handball and two squash
courts. This floor is the last one con-
nected with Doremus and it opens
into the current student locker
rooms, which are in the remodeling
stage. The second floor down again
houses team rooms and classrooms.
The third level is the home of the
new pool and diving area. While
only 25 yards long, the pool meas-
ures 200 yards wide and 12 feet at
its deepest. A three meter and one
meter board will be installed. Per-
manent concrete stands on one side
will seat approximately 300 to 500
spectators, The last and bottom half
level, holds the pool’s operating
equipment.

According to construction plans,
the circular drive in front of old
Doremus will be broken up and
grass planted. All gym parking will
be assigned to the three levels of
parking on the south side of the
site. Access to the lot will be from
Highway 60. The parking area could
be the only part of the plan not
completed by December 1.

As mentioned, parts of the gym

will be open prior to official dedica-

tion. The new basketball court
should be ready for the team to be-
gin practice in late October, The

pool will not be opened beforehand.
Several handball courts should also
be available in middle to late Octo-
ber,

Sophomore quarterback Steve Fluharty flings pass in loss to Randolph-Macon

Generals Bow To Randolph-Macon;
Team Meets Towson State Saturday

BY LEWIS HIXSON

It was a gallant but futile effort
on the part of Washington and Lee
Generals here Saturday in a losing
scrimmage with Randolph-Macon.
There were a few bright spots but
they came only in the mist of an
overall losing cause.

Steve Fluharty, though continu-
ously harrassed, showed he still has
the arm that enabled him to capture
a high position among small college
passers last season. Fluharty com-
pleted numerous passes to Bill Bald-
win and Chappy Conrad as the pair
showed they have the ability to be-
come excellent receivers. Lat Per-
cer and JoJo Martin gained good
yardage on quick openers and end
sweeps.

Even though there were good in-
dividual performances the W&L of-
fense as a whole was unable to put
together any sort of a concentrated

scoring effort. It still looks like one
of the major question marks this
season will be the offensive line.
Randolph-Macon’s defensive _ line
was continuously breaking through
to put pressure on Fluharty and any
sort of straight ahead plunge was
usually repulsed with ease. If W&L
is to have any sort of a successful
season this offensive line will have
to improve quite a bit.

When looking at the defense one
would have to wonder whether or
not the defense will be able to hold
this year’s opponents to the 250
points that were allowed last cam-
paign. The defensive secondary had
more holes than a slice of swiss
cheese. Randolph-Macon hit on
passes at will. The Generals’ de-
fensive line had its good plays and
its bad ones, the bad ones hurting a
great deal. One end sweep went for
a 35 yard touchdown,

When looking at the overall team
one can see that there will have to
be a significant improvement before
the Blue team can match powerful
Towson State in this year’s opener.
“We couldn't have picked a tougher
opening game,” commented Coach
Buck Leslie. Towson State promises
to have a big, strong team and the
Generals are certain to have their
hands full.

WAL dropped a 30-14 opener last
year to the Tigers.

Towson has one game already
under its belt, a 49-6 rout by Cen-
tral Connecticut that W&L Coach
Buck Leslie says is deceiving.

“Towson fell behind 24-0 in the
first quarter after a lost fumble and
several interceptions,” Leslie noted,
“and had to play ‘catch-up’ the rest
of the day.”

As a result, Towson threw 46
passes, completing 15 and having
five intercepted.

“| don’t look for them to throw
as much against us,” Coach Leslie
commented. “We know they prefer
to run more.”

Needless to say, Coach Leslie
will be stressing the goal line offense,
tackling and team pursuit in drills
this week in preparation for Satur-
day's 2:00 p.m. kickoff at Towson.

Baseball Note:

There will be a meeting of all
those interested in playing varsity
baseball tonight at 8:00 p.m. in the
meeting room upstairs in Doremus
Gymnasium.

Soccer Looks To Opener

BY CLIFF OVERCASH

“Once this club jives, it should be
a nice scoring machine,” commented
Coach Joe Lyles about this year’s
soccer team. Although a very young
team, this squad 1s laden with ex-
cellent depth; at present two full
starting teams could be fielded. The
team has been working hard, and
this has taken its toll in injuries.
Several players are hurt, among
them Jim Kahn with two bad knees,
Barry Gruters with a pulled groin
muscle, Rolf Piranian with a twisted
ankle, and several others with knee
and leg injuries. However, this has
failed to deter the team’s competi-
tiveness, and, as Coach Lyles point-
ed out, “it will be hard to keep this
team still.”

With the arrival of several out-
standing freshmen, including Gard-
ner Britt, Barclay Armstrong, Mike
Kurilez, Robert Crawford, John
Embree, and Chuck Alexander, the
team should have a youthful look.
The excellent play of one freshman,
Jimmy Fox, has been quite impres-
sive, and he is listed as a probable
starter. Having such a young team
has posed some problems that will
not and cannot be answered until
the season begins. Coach Lyles

stressed the importance of the play-
ers learning each other’s key moves
and said he really needs some more
scrimmages in order to accomplish
this. With only seven lettermen re-
turning from last year’s squad, most
coaches would be quite concerned,
but Coach Lyles said that this team
could receive Washington & Lee’s
next invitation to the National
Tournament.

The 1971 team, led by captains
Meade Kampfmuller and Brandon
Herbert, has on its schedule power-
ful foes such as William & Mary,
Dickinson, Madison, and Navy. The
Dickinson game, the team’s first, will
be played Saturday, September 25,
at 3:00 p.m, at home. This promises
to be a tough battle, as the W&L
team wants to revenge last year’s 1-0
loss. The Generals also have a re-
turn clash with V.M.L, a team that
has improved greatly over last year.
Coach Lyles promises that this will
be “spirited game.” On October 30,
Washington and Lee travels to An-
napolis to face the Naval Academy
in a game that should be quite ex-
citing. It is doubtful the Washington
and Lee team will have any trouble
getting up for this game, as Navy
always is ranked high in the collegi-

ate standings.

Although a lot has been said of
the excellent group of freshmen try-
ing out for a place on this year’s
team, there is also a fine array of
upperclassmen who will add the
needed experience to help this club
jell. Among them are Mike Shaeffer,
Bill Spofford, Rolf Piranian, John
Buckley, Dave Campbell, Kampf-
muller, and Herbert. They will be
leading the team’s probable 4-3-3
formation, one that will stress more
offense than defense. However, as
Coach Lyles put it, “a good defense
is your best offense.” For the first
time in a couple of years, the team
finally has some good “insides”, and
they won't have to rely on one or
two players to carry the burden of
work,

Also for the first time Washington
& Lee will have a JV team headed
by Assistant Coach John Griffith
from West Virginia Wesleyan. Coach
Griffith is presently a law student
here, and Head Coach Lyles says he
is doing a very fine job.

This year’s soccer team has in
front of it a very challenging season,
an dif the club lives up to the ex-
pectations of Coach Joe Lyles, it
could be a very successful one.

Harriers Ready
For ’71 Season

The W&L Cross-Country team
opens its 1971 season on Saturday,
October 2 against Centre College of
Danville. Kentucky, Coach Dick
Miller feels that the harriers will be
at least as strong as last year’s team,
which recorded a 7-3 record, al-
though they may not have as much
depth. Two a day practices were be-
gun on September 8 and the runners
quickly worked up to 10 or 12
miles per day.

Looking especially impressive dur-
ing the early practices have been
Bill Kalal, Bob Sherwood, and
freshman Harrison Turnbull. Hope-
fully returning runners Doug Me-
Neel, Jim Hornor, Carter Glass,
Tim Kearney, Prent Eager, and Jim
Haydon will provide the needed
depth. Other freshman prospects in-
clude Jeff Fischer, Dave Wallace,
and Dave Mycoff. Sherwood and
Glass are serving as co-captains this
fall.

of the State Board of Education, and
its purpose is to study the advan-
tages and disadvantages of school
consolidation.

The committee, along with several
local school superintendents and
other educators, including Dr. Phil-
lips of W&L, attended a meeting on
the question held in Richmond.

Dr. John DeVogt, head of the
W&L Department of Commerce,
was chosen to serve on the newly en-
larged City School Board. City
Council selected Dr. DeVogt and
three others from a list of 28 names.

He was appointed on May 20,
1971, and will serve a three year
term. The other members chosen
were Joseph Murchison, Mrs. Wil-

Robinson On Honor Code

(Continued from page 1)

Honor is a relative matter. What
was considered dishonorable in 1910
may not be similarly judged today.
The key to the judgment of some
action as dishonorable is the values
and opinions of the students at W&L
today. Thus, you can see how your
own idea of honor is important.
Hopefully, this personal concept is
consistent with that of your contem-
poraries. However, if your ideas of
honor are vastly different from those
held by the rest of the student body,
it is advisable for you to discover
what thoughts of honor are held by
the majority of students, For it is
against these accepted provisions of
honor that you will be judged if
your honor is ever questioned.

The second responsibility is one
to all others who live under the sys-
tem. The honor system is not effec-
tive if those who violate it are not
discovered, Possible violations must
be brought to the attention of the
EC. By advising the Executive Com-
mittee of a possible honor violation,
you are not betraying the man. By
not telling the EC of a possible vio-
tion, you are failing to support the
honor system, and thereby helping
to destroy it.

If you are ever accused of an
honor violation, the EC will meet in
a preliminary hearing to consider
the evidence; if the committee feels
that there is sufficient evidence to in-
vestigate the circumstances  sur-
rounding the alleged violation, the
regular hearing will be held.

This hearing is not a criminal
proceeding; the Executive Commit-
tee is not trying to prosecute indi-
viduals. On the contrary, this hear-
ing is an investigative session. The
EC is only to discover the facts sur-
rounding the incident.

The Honor System has but one
penalty for a violation, and that is
dismissal from the University. There
has been considerable criticism of
the absolute penalty; many people
have thought a system of graduated
penalties would be more desirable
than the present system. But there
are no gray areas in the issue of
honor. And since a man knows
about the Honor System when he
comes to WA&L, if he does not
choose to perpetuate the ideas by
which we all abide, he need not re-
main.

System is Washington & Lee. I do
not believe this. Without the Honor
System, however, W&L, as we know
it, would disappear, for the honor
system does embody the spirit of
Washington and Lee. And for that
reason, it is something we must per-
petuate,

The fact that you are here indi-
cates that you have at least made the
initial commitment to the Honor
System and your own sense of
honor. Yet there is no assurance that
you will always abide by the Honor
System during your four years at
W&L. To violate the Honor System,
however, is to shirk your responsi-
bility toward the system, and to par-
tially destroy a way of life at Wash-
ington and Lee.

The Honor System has existed for
so many years because students be-
fore you have accepted an defended
its values. Every class before you
has been able to gather the benefits
of the honor system, preserving it
for future W&L students, It is up to
each student to maintain this heri-
tage.

Watercolors

In Bookstore

Fifteen watercolor paintings by
Prof. Marion M. Junkin, noted
American artist and former head of
Washington and Lee University’s
fine arts department, are on exhibi-
tion currently in the university
paperback bookstore.

The show will continue through
late October, according to Mrs. Ro-
bert Munger, manager. Hours are
from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. and 8 p.m.
to 10 p.m. each weekday.

In addition to his watercolors,
Dr. Junkin will have on exhibit
specially created copper etchings,
one of the Washington and Lee
campus and another of neighboring
Virginia Military Institute. The etch-
ings — already matted — will be
available in limited editions of 100,

signed by the artist, at $25 each,

Prof. Junkin, a native of Korea, is
a 1927 graduate of Washington and
Lee. He headed Vanderbilt Univer-
sity’s fine arts department before re-
turning to his alma mater in 1949 as
founder and head of the department.
In that year Washington and Lee
awarded him an honorary doctorate
in fine arts.

He is exceptionally well known
for his murals as well as his paint-
ings. He has painted frescoes in
corporate and public buildings and
colleges throughout the nation, and
his paintings are included in many
of the country’s most noteworthy
collections,

Though he retired from admini-
strative duties in the fine arts de-
partment in 1969, Dr, Junkin con-
tinues to teach full-time and to
paint.

Graduate Record Exam
Will be Given Oct. 23

Educational Testing Service has
announced that undergraduates and
others preparing to go to graduate
school may take the Graduate Rec-
ord Examinations on any of six diff-
erent test dates during the current
academic year.

The first testing date for the GRE
is October 23, 1971. Scores from
this administration will be reported
to the graduate schools around De-
cember 1. Students planning to regi-
ster for the October test date are
advised that applications received
by ETS after October 5 will incur a
$3.50 late registration fee. After
October 8, there is no guarantee that
applications for the October test
date can be processed.

The other five test dates are De-
cember 11, 1971, January 15, Feb-
ruary 26, April 22, and June 17,
1972. Equivalent late fee and regis-
tration deadlines apply to these
dates. Choice of test dates should be
determined by the requirements of
graduate schools or fellowships to
which one is applying. Scores are
usually reported to graduate schools
five weeks after a test date.

Full details and registration forms
may be obtained in Dean Watt's of-
fice.

Concert Guild Starts New Season

(Continued from page 1)

Mr. Zaslav is the violist with the
Fine Arts String Quartet.

On Nov, 2, pianist John Savory
will perform in Lee Chapel. Mr.
Savory stresses modern works in his
repetoire along with the more tra-
ditional compositions. This will be

Bassoonist Maurice Pachman
comes to Lexington on November 8.
Mr. Pachman is presently first bas-
soonist at Radio City Music Hall

soon and emphasizes contemporary
pieces in his concert. Mr. Pachman
was presented at Washington and
Lee in 1966,

The Stradivari Quartet will appear
in Lexington on January 25. The
Quartet, in residence at the Univer-

strong discipline and range of emo-
tion. Their repetoire encompasses
both classical and modern quartet
literature.

Ohemes, violin, John Ferrell, violin,
William Preucil, viola, and Charles
Wendt, cello.

Dr. James G. Leyburn, Washing-
ton and Lee Professor of Sociology,

color humor.” The group sings
without accompaniment and incor-
porates a four-part harmony.

Founded in 1956 by a group of
drinking buddies who, as Gillespie
noted, “just got together to sing,”
the Sazeracs perform annually at
Parents Weekend, at nearby girls’
schools, conventions, and serosts.
The highlight of the year is their
spring trip to Palm Beach, Florida
where they perform for one week at
the Taboo Club.

For any interested freshmen, the
Sazeracs are holding tryouts next
Monday and Tuesday nights, from
8:00 to 9:00 in the Music Room of
the Student Center.

Washington and Lee in 1947, Dr.
Leyburn has performed several re-
citals, accompanied visiting artists
and played the organ for many
church services in Lexington.

Dr. Leyburn’s program may be
entitled “18th Century Composers
and Their 20th Century Admirers.”

On March 14, the Philador Trio
will present a concert of Baroque
music. Each of the performers have
been members of the New York Pro
Musica, for several years, They are
Elizabeth Humes, soprano, Shelly
Fruskin, baroque flute and record-
ers, Edward Smith, harpsichord,

All concerts are free to Washing-
ton and Lee students.

the right to vote. He is married and
works for the university in the Ad-
missions Office. Therefore, he must
be classified a relatively stable resi-
dent, evidenced by the fact Bill re-
mained in Lexington this summer to
work. The rationale utilized by the
City Registrar appears to be some-
what lacking indeed. JWR

‘“Non-events”’ cited
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Just a footnote to your editorial
comments last week on this past
summer's non-events. There are two
things you failed to mention which
I consider significant. One is the
Lexington Fine Arts Workshop held
on this campus during the four
weeks of July. Offering daily courses
in art, music, drama, and dance, the
workshop was attended by some
sixty children from the Lexington
area. The staff included a large num-
ber of people from the W&L com-
munity.

The other event is the emergence
of a new community trouble center
called Reach-Out. This referral and
counseling center will serve the Lex-
ington Rockbridge area and is being
staffed by trained volunteers. Here
again, the staff includes a number of
people from the campus community.

These two events, I feel, are signi-
ficant new breakthroughs in our
town-gown relations and deserve
recognition,
