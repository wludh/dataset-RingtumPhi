Lewises Give W&L $9 Million,
Largest Gift In School’s History

Sum To Endow
Legal Center

Yesterday Mr. and Mrs, Sydney
Lewis, of Richmond, gave $9 mil-
lion to Washington and Lee Uni-
versity. The gift is the largest in
the 200 year history of the institu-
tion.

The gift will help make possible
construction of a $7 million law
building, which will bear the name
Lewis Hall. It will also establish the
initial endowment for a law center,
to be named the Frances Lewis Law
Center in honor of Mrs. Lewis.

Robert E. R. Huntley, president
of the university, announced the gift
and disclosed detailed plans for the
new building and law center in
Richmond,

Mr. Lewis is an alumnus of both
Washington and Lee's undergradu-
ate and law schools and is a trustee

of the university. He is founder and .

president of Best Products Inc.,
the Richmond-based catalogue mer-
chandising firm.

Joining in the announcement were
Dr. John Newton Thomas of Rich-
mond, rector of the board of trus-
tees; John M, Stemmons of Dallas,
Tex., president of Industrial Prop-
erties Corp., and Roy L. Stein-
heimer Jr., dean of the School of
Law.

Mr. Stemmons is chairman of the
“Achievement Council,” the organi-
zation created by university trustees
to direct a comprehensive develop-
ment program, announced last
month, which secks to raise $36
million by 1976.

Mr. and Mrs. Lewis’ gift brings
to $18,528,469 the amount com-
mitted to date toward the $36 mil-
lion goal, Of the current total, $11.5
million represents contributions
from all 19 members of Washing-
ton and Lee’s board of trustees.

The Frances Lewis Law Center,
Dean Steinheimer said, will permit
Washington and Lee law students
and faculty to undertake “pioneer-
ing investigation and analysis” of
matters regarding current and future
development of law and legal pro-
cesses.

Both theoretical and practical, of
“clinical,” approaches will be en-
couraged in the Law Center, he
added.

Construction of the new law
building is expected to begin before
the end of the year, President Hunt-
ley revealed. Architectual plans and
specifications have been in prepara-
tion for more than two years, he
said, and the university anticipates
that they will be ready to be sub
mitted for bids by the end of the
surmmner.

Mr. Huntley said the new facility
is expeoted to be ready for occu-
pancy by September, 1975

The building will contain 117,219
square feet of space-——more than
six times the 18,813 square feet in

the existing law building, Tucker
Hall. Tucker was constructed in
1935 to accommodate a law stu

dent body of 76

At present, law enrollment is 252
The new building is designed to ac
commodate 350 students, the en
roliment figure the university has
determined to be most desirable for
a quality law program of the
character of Washington and Lee's

The School of Law was founded
independently in 1849 and incorpo-
rated by Robert E. Lee, then presi-
dent of Washington College, as a
division of the institution in 1866,

The School of Law numbers five
former presidents of the American
Bar Association among its alumni—
including Mr. Malone (1958-59) and
Supreme Court Justice Lewis F.
Powell Jr. (1964-65), both Wash-
ington and Lee trustees. Only two
other law schools, those at Colum-
bia and Harvard Universities, have
seen more alumni elected to head
the A.B.A.

More than 100 graduates of the
School of Law are currently judges
at every level throughout the na-
tion. Three of the 25 largest cor-
porations in the nation have Wash-
ington and Lee law alumni as
general counsel or executive ad-
ministrators of the legal staff: Gen-
eral Motors, U.S. Steel, and Union
Carbide.

The new Frances Lewis Law Cen-
ter at Washington and Lee will
make possible a “comprehensive, in-
depth program of studies—in class
and out—relating to the awesome
problems which face the law in
American society,” according to
Roy Steinheimer, the university law
dean.

“lt will permit the development
of effective research methods on
the problems themselves, and pos-
sible solutions to them,” he said.

An important function of the Law
Center, he said, will be designing
proposals for changes in existing

laws and in the administration of
justice.
The Law Center will provide

leaves for law teachers to conduct
extensive investigation into problems
on ‘the frontiers of the law, he said.
In addition, the center will sponsor
seminars, symposia and institutes in
which experts from across the na-
tion, both lawyers and laymen alike,
will participate with Washington
and Lee law faculty and students.

Another important function of
the Frances Lewis Law Center will
be publication of the results of pro-
jects, Steimnheimer said, both in the
traditional manner, in books and
periodicals, and in innovative new
ways—by electronic videotape, for
example.

The principal intellectual asset of
the Lew Center will be the uni-
versity’s own law faculty, the dean
said, together with its student body,
library, and other resources.

A particularly distinctive feature
of the Frances Lewis Law Center
will be its association with a law
program that awards only the first
professional degree in law. Wash-
ifgton and Lee has no other gradu-
ate programs and plans to add none

The undergraduate faculty at
Washington and Lee will add still
another crucially valuable dimension
to the center, he noted

im

Mr. and Mrs, Sydney L

ewis donated $9 million to Washington and Lee

     

University to support the development of the law school and an innovative

center for research in law.

A number of programs in opera-
tion at Washington and Lee for
several years will be incorporated
in the Law Center's scope of opera-
tion, Steinheimer said, including
legal aid and legal research activi-
ties.

When the new law facility is
completed, President Huntley said,
a major concern will be an ap
proximate doubling of the size of
the law faculty from its current
10. A director for Law Center
activities will also be added, he
said,

Mr. Lewis is a trustee of Wash
ington and Lee and of Virginia
Union University, and a member
of the boards of the Meditertanean
Society and Jewish Family Services
Mr. Lewis has served as president
and campaign chairman of the Rich-
mond Jewish Community Council,
president of the Southern Region
Council of Jewish Federations, and
board member of Temple Beth
Ahaba and the Richmond Area
Community Council

In all, $16,500,000 for the School
of Law—$14.5 million for building
and endowment and an additional
$2 million, contributed through the
