“To promote literature in this rising
empire and to encourage the arts
have ever been amongst the warmest
wishes of my heart.”

Tonight

House,

Chapel

By ANDY SIMPSON
Approximately 70-80 — students
and members of the W&L com-
munity gathered in Fairfax Lounge
last night to arrange a schedule of
peaceful protest events in Lexing-
ton designed to show President

Nixon that not all people “are
standing in support of his war

policy, but are standing away from
it.” The meeting was prompted by
Nixon's television announcement
Monday evening stating his plans to
mine Haiphong harbor.

A number of suggested avenues
of protest were discussed at the
meeting. For the present, the fol-
lowing moves have been planned:

—starting at 7 p.m. this evening,
a peaceful rally given to prayer and
meditation for peace will be held
at the county courthouse,

—following the prayer session
there will be a peacful march from
the courthouse to Lee Chapel.
the campus, speakers, in-
cluding university professors and
community leaders, will be heard.

—"telegram tables,” hopefully
one each at Kroger’s shopping cen-
ter, the courthouse square, Wash-
ington Hall, and the Student Center
will be set up until 6 p.m. tonight.
Volunteers will assist people desir-
ing to add their names to a joint
telegram and/or petition with word-
ing of protest against the Nixon
war policy. These will be s nt to

the White House and to Senator
Spong (D-Va.).
—encouragement for individuals

to send their own telegrams at $1.25
for 15 words to their representatives.
The toll free number for the tele-

grams is 1-800-542-5769,

The group refrained from out
lining definite plans for future action
beyond today’s activities as the rally
itself is intended to be an informa-
tive, discussion-type affair, out of
which will come ideas for future
action. The rally is scheduled to
coincide with the time of a speech
to be given by James Roche, former
Chairman of the Board of General
Motors, at Lee Chapel. The group’s
aims are to avoid disrupting Mr.
Roche's talk, keep the event peace-
ful and to invite Mr. Roche to
address their own gathering. It is
also hoped that many of those at-
tending the Roche lecture will later
attend the rally.

The suggestion was also made by
Steve Robinson, after confering with
the National Student Lobby in D.C.,

that people urge their senators to
support the latest Frank Church
(D-Idaho) amendment concerning
limitation of presidential war
.powers, The bill is due for a vote
in the Senate on Friday.

Bill Mcllhany, representing as he
termed it, “the individual right,”
said he and those of his persuosion
were also opposed to Nixon’s policy
and were interested in a “dump
Nixon” movement. Mr. Mcllhany’s
presence at the meeting prompted
the comment: “Politics makes
strange bedfellows.”

In the course of the meeting, Pete
Swart made the comment that al-
though the desire was to have a
total community effort, “one should
not undersell the significance of a
small southern school protesting the
Nixon policy.”

“The proper education of youth re-
quires not only great ability, but I
fear, more strength than I now
possess.”

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, MAY 10,

Sentor Edward Moore Kennedy
of Massachusetts emerged last week-
end as the W&L Mock Democratic
Convention's nominee for  presi-
dent this year. According to the
convention, Kennedy will team
with Wilbur Mills to complete the
Democrats’ president vice-president
slate,

Kennedy came on strong follow-
ing the third ballot, where front-
runners George McGovern and
Hubert Humphrey appeared dead-
locked at 1489'4 and 1390 votes
respectively. Changes in that ballot
were allowed to be made by con-
vention officials, and the finalized
count for the third ballot left Mc-
Govern with 1140 and Humphrey
with 1333'3 votes, while Kennedy
picked up 531'% votes.

McGovern started out on the first
ballot with a strong lead, and ap-
peared as the early choice of the
convention for the nomination, pick
ing up 1204'5 votes to Humphrey's
754 tallies. The decisive factor in
the first ballot was the commitment
of the California “winner-take-all”
bloc of 271 votes to McGovern.

McGovern tallied 135514 in the
second ballot. and reached his
highest total of 14891!4 votes—just
19's votes short of the total needed
for nomination——on the third ballot
b-fore several state delegation made
their changes. The introduction of
Kennedy as a “compromise candi-
late” hurt both the McGovern and
fiumphrey camps.

Kennedy's ially steadily progress-
ed through the fourth ballot. with
912', votes, and the fifth ballot.
where he procured 1476 votes, just
33 short of the 1509 votes needed
for the nomination,

A 90-minute break after the fifth
ballot slowed Kennedy's momentum
somewhat. His total dropped to
1335 votes, while Senator Edmund
Muskie of Maine made a sirong
comeback with 951 votes after his
ipparent disappearance from the
ace after the third ballot.

The seventh ballot brought a
head-on confrontation between the
Kennedy and Muskie forces. A
caucus of southern states appar-
ently boosted the Muskie bid con-
siderably, as he picked up votes in

TEER EAS

|OUTLOOK andREVIEW
The Choice Of Ted Kennedy

Another wild Mock Convention is now behind us, and this

  

year’s was certainly wilder and more exhaustive than most. The
ultimate choice of Senator Kennedy for President was a big
surprise; but while the accuracy of the outcome may be questioned,
the convention's effectiveness is not.

As little as a month or two ago, one could have justifiably won-
dered if the whole project was coming off at all. If one phenomen-
on could have characterized the American college student this year,
it was his apathy toward Establishment politics, and our student
body was no exception. ‘The Mock Convention leadership faced
an uphill battle all the way to infect our student body with their
own brand of enthusiasm—-and the most remarkable thing about
last weekend's proceedings was the extent to which they had suc-
ceeded.

While the preliminary remarks of both Governor Carter and
Senator Gravel were somewhat less than rousing, Friday's fight
over the platform was a marvelous warm-up for the more serious
business of nomination on Saturday. ‘The patience and durability of
Mike Campilongo (permanent chairman) and Mike Guroian
(Convention clerk) on the podium was commendable.

The inescapable question is: was it accurate? And the answer
is, well, maybe. This has been a bad year for predictions; a couple
months ago Stewart Alsop (and everyone else) said, barring
miracles, Muskie was a shoe-in. The miracle happened, and Mus-
kie’s Presidential star plummeted.

The fact is that anything can happen between now and July
when the Democratic Party will convene in Miami Beach, Four
years ago at this time, Robert Kennedy was still alive and sweeping
like wildfire through the primaries. We live in an age when politi-
cal events and circumstances seem constantly in the process of
tumbling.

If the convention in Miami deadlocks (as ours did Saturday
night) between Hubert Humphrey and George McGovern, Ted
Kennedy will be the logical man to turn to. The Democratic dele-
gates have already witnessed how lackluster Md Muskie is on the
campaign trail, so his hopes to be the compromise candidate must
be counted as slim. If the Democrats have any hopes of beating
Nixon in November, they will turn to Kennedy.

But even if they do, will Kennedy run? Most assuredly, yes.
We don't doubt Kennedy's sincerity when he insists he is not a
candidate; the task of facing an incumbent President is unenviable
for anyone, and another four years would further erase the
memory of the bleak Chappaquiddick incident.

But Kennedy could not refuse a draft this year and still ex-
pect the nomination in 1976, A man cannot abandon his party in
time of crisis.

Our odds-on guess is that there will be no deadlock in July,
and that HLumphrey will once more be his party's standard bearer.
While McGovern seems to be gaining strength in the primary cir-
cuit, our Mock convention showed that he probably will fall short
of the necessary momentum. Saturday he came awfully close to
capturing the nomination on the third ballot, but he had all of the
California and New York votes in his pocket, votes which are
in reality still way up in the air,

Another interesting twist revealed by our Mock proceedings
was the quick decline of support for George Wallace. If this
holds true for the actual convention, Wallace will end up with
little real bargaining power over the other candidates.

There was some initial despondency among the Mock Conven-
tion organizers over the Kennedy nomination—they feared they
were seeing all their year-long efforts for accuracy coming to
naught. But Credentials chairman Fred Franke said that, given
what the students had to go on at this particular time, the outcome
was substantially correct. We are inclined to agree with him. The
state chairmen, for the most part, approached their job seriously
and researched their votes well,

In any event, both ‘Tom Gillespie and Mike Campilongo de-
serve thanks for their dedication and determination to see the Con
vention through to success. Hopefully, as a result of their efforts,
Wl, students will follow through to become involved in the actual
political process this year, through working and voting. We trust
what we saw was not Mock Enthusiasm.

The Mock Convention protrudes
in one’s memory as a conglomer-
tion of politics, placards, speeches,
music, excitement and boredom.
From the perch of the press bal-
cony, the whole event produced
endless variety for the statewide
reporters,

Upon entering the gym, dele-
gates were infected with the con-
vention atmosphere. The basket-
ball arena had been transformed
into a red, white, and blue, star-
studded bedlam. Candidates’ pic-
tures were omni-present. Fake
straw hats (with the everpresent
red, white, and blue trim) dotted
the floor. And as if General Lee
had returned and rejuvenated
conventional dress, suits or at
least coats - and - ties-abounded.
Simply stated it was the greatest
show in town,

To set the stage for the two day
extravaganza, was the Mock Con-
vention Parade down Washington
Street. Propriety was abandoned,
as “floats” stressed double-enten-
dre, and the ridiculous throughout
the hour long procession.

The convention itself was crowd-
ed the first day. Students with
white-painted faces meandered
among the delegates, gaining lit-
tle attention amid the festive at-
inosphere. Most participants, hav-
ing never seen a Mock Conven-
tion, did not know what was re-
quired of them, and became intent
on just having fun. Quickly, dele-
gates realized that their role in the
affair was quite minimal. There-

Sulls Records A Winner

BY PAT HINELY
Stephen Stills: Manassas
Atlantic SD2-903

Steve Stills has proved with this
2-record set that he IS capable of
putting together an album with a
good sound. A certain amount of
retrogression is evident; some of
the songs on Manassas sound so
much like Buffalo Springfield that
I almost hear Neil Young singing
harmonies.

Stills finally has gotten rid of
the BS&T-Al Kooper brass &
soul backups. It's about time. His
new band has a sound which fits
type of music much better. Joe
Lala on conga & timbales adds
just the right touch of latin-San-
tana rhythm, complementing Dal-
las ‘Taylor's hard-driving style on
traps quite well. Paul Harris’ key-
boards shine through at the right
times—-only the right times. There
are no more organ runs fleeting
uselessly through the background.

The music is still heavily pro-
duced; if the band can play this
music as well in coneert as they
can in the studio, it would be quite
an accomplishment. However, un-
like Stills’ earlier solo efforts, the
sound doesn't overpower the lis-
tener with its intricacy. Its virtue
is its wholesomeness.

Stills hasn't given up on socio
political lyrics, but a song like
“Fallen Eagle” is artistically solid
enough toe stand on its own as an
appeal to stop killing birds or just
good country tune. Byron
Berline, who has played fiddle
with the Byrds, adds the finishing
touch to the old CSN&Y
harmony. Chris Hillman, himself
an ex-lved, can be heard on man
dolin and rhythm guitar, Al Per-
kins on steel guitar is the first
steel plaver to give Jerry Garcia
competition, and Perkins might
come out on top.

Hot Tuna: Burgers

Grunt FTR-1004

Jorma Kaukonen, on Burgers,
has put together his first studio
album. Some of his cuts on earlier
Jefferson Airplane albums have
been quite nice, but he did this
whole album, and the results make
it obvious. The only conclusion to
be drawn is that he can do without
the Airplane, but the Airplane
couldn't do without him.

Kaukonen tracked himself to
perfection on a par with Hendrix.
The blend of electric and acoustic
is iucid enough to make you
reach into the speaker and try to
pick the strings.

Papa John Creach and his elect-
ric fiddle are in evidence on every
cut except “Water Song,” and he
adds the fourth dimension to
every song he plays on. After fifty
vears of playing violin, Creach has
perfected his technique so com-
pletely that he probably could talk
with it if he needed to.

Papa John has a way of moving
up the scale rather than down, and
the squeaky-squirmy sounds he
puts out bridge any gap that might
between St. Louis and San
Pranciseo. Jack Casady proves
that it IS possible to get a melody

drummer, is perfect for this group

The nomination of the Presi-
dential Candidate consumed most
of Saturday. Nomination speeches
were largely lackluster with the
exception of Lawson Turner's
stirring appeal for Wilbur Mills.
Seven ballots were conducted.
However, nine would be a more
accurate total. This convention's
state chairmen had a strange ha-
bit of demanding the right to al-
ter votes. Two times states were
given the chance to change their
minds, Hach ballot brought swirls
of people around state chairmen
as deals were made and remade.

Kennedy voted for basketball
coach Adolph Rupp for Presi-
dent. Duncan Pace described
Klorida as the home of “blue

water, green grass and red necks.”
The Kentucky delegation in later
antics, walked out enmasse to see
the Derby on the tube. Chaos
people, whoever thev are, waved
signs such as: “KILLER KEN-
NEDY” and “END THE LIES".

After half-a-day of voting the
convention turned out to be dead-
locked. Muskie, Kennedy, MeGov-
ern and Humphrey had all made
strong bid, but none received the
1500 plus votes. Constant calls of
“Marshals, clear the aisles!” rang
across the hall, now depleted by
departed lacrosse fans and tanked
delegates. Frustration grew and
nobody looked capable of winning
the nomination and more impor-
tantly the roll calls would appar-
ently continue until doomsday.
The more populous states finally
went to Kennedy and that was the
big push that put the Senator on

top.

Wilbur Mills took the Vice
Presidential voting race. He
soundly defeated Terry Sanford

before an empty auditorium.

The whole thing was totally un-
predictable, which lent it a large
degree of magic. Minute changes
in voting were duly noted by the

aloud, “Will he take it?” And

everybody else answered in exas-

Curriculum Committee

The Student Curriculum Com-
mittee was first organized during
the course of the extensive dis-
cussions that resulted in the new
University calendar and the mas-
sive curriculum changes initiated
two years ago. While many long-
sought reforms worked out by
faculty and students were achiev-
ed at that time, the need for an
‘official, responsible student or-
vanization to channel opinion on
curriculum still persists.

member should possess some ideas

of his own on the state of the
curriculum; each year much of the

itself. At the same time, it is de

datery, that the applicant possess

a reasonably knowledgable aware

Financial Relations

One privilege a W&L, student
has in Lexington and surrounding
communities, but which he often
that of cashing
checks. The purpose of the Stu-
dent Financial Relation Commit-
tee is to preserve this privilege.
The committee will make good
cold checks. The student passing
the bad check is then contacted to
appear before the committee in
order to find out why his check
bounced. The committee must
then decide on the students guilt
and fine him accordingly.

The first offense draws a fine of
between $1.00 and $5.00. For a
second offense there is a fine up to
$10.00, Third offenders may be
fined up to $25.00 and asked to
appear before the .xecutive Com-
mittee.

Committee is to provide

laree. This year’s programs have
included regular weekend combo
parties, weekly folk-singing jams,

a Sunday popular movie program,
and Wnhednesday happy hours, all
taking place in the University
Center Cockpit. In addition, the
committee has been sponsoring
frequent student art exhibits, a
Saturday outdoor musical festival,
and a bridge tournament

Other tasks include running
book collection drives for the Uni
Center Library, selecting
Inaeazine subscriptions for that
une library, and acting as an ad-

visory board to the University
Center Director and to the man-
ager of the Cockpit.

Besides continuing with the
above programs and responsibili-
ties, plans for the future include
considerable expansion of  pro-
erams. Possibilities for the future
include more types of tourna-
ments, such as pool, ping pong,
and chess; a possible student art
festival; more faculty-student dis-
cussions and get-togethers; and
an increase in programs that of-
fer new ways for W&L, students
to get together with students from
surrounding colleges.

The committee seeks members
who display imagination since
fresh ideas are always welcome.
But along with this, members are
also needed who are willing to
work. At the weekly meetings, as-
signments are given which must
be carried out if the committee is
to function properly.

Student Control

he Student Control Committee
tries to serve the best interests of
both the University and the W&L
students by enforcing reasonable
standards of behavior for the stu-
dent body. By taking an active
concern in the behavior (or misbe-
havior) of students, the Commit-
tee tries to promote good relation-
between Washington and
Lee and the Lexington commun-
ity. Because of our unique social
setting, the Committee's jurisdic-
tion is extended to include rela-
tions with the surrounding girls’
s¢ hools also Misconduct or viola-
tions of civil law are viewed as in-
jurious to the reputation of W&L
and unbecoming of a student at
this University.

Destruction of property, inde-
cent exposure, “pranks,” flagrant
financial irresponsibility, and con

ships

duct endangering other persons
may be viewed as unreasonable
student behavior.

It is the task of the Student

Control Committee to assess the
degree of misconduct in each case
and, in interaction with the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee of the
faculty, work to maintain reason-
able standards of conduct through-
out the W&L community. The re-

Sunday the Generals scored early
and held on to beat the neighboring
Keydets. Gutshall tripled Doug
