Administration Positions

Schildt Joins Law Firm

William McC. Schildt, Associate
Dean of Students, is resigning his
Washington Hall post to assume law
practice in Baltimore. Schildt has
been a member of the Washington
and Lee administration since 1968.

He will be replaced on August |
by William A. Noell, who presently
Financial Aid Director.
Schildt will then join the firm of
Miles and Stockbridge, where he will
be involved with corporate law.

As Associate Dean of Students,
Schildt's duties have been diverse
and varying. He has served as a pol-
icy-maker as well as an interviewer
in Admissions, as co-ordinator of
Freshman year, and as head of the
Dormitory counselor personnel.
Dean Noell said that his responsibili-
ties will be essentially the same as
Schildt's

“| don't look forward to leaving
Washington and Lee.” Schildt told
he Ring-tum Phi. Bui [| have al-

both.”

He stated that what he will miss
most is the student related work. “I
worked almost exclusively in admis-
a year or so,” he said. “I
vas also able to teach on a limited
basis in the undergraduate school,
is well as in the law school.’

Schildt expressed the fear that
he will lose “the personal dimension”
f his when he becomes in
volved in corporate practice. “May

In the academic realm, Schildt
noted a “general increase of interest

that it would be to W&L’s advantage
in the long run to respond to this
interest,

Schildi finally confessed a fond-
ness for his destination, Baltimore.
“| find it to have a more ‘small-

Noell Appointed

One promotion and two additions
to the staff of Washington and Lee
student services personnel have been
announced by Lewis G. John, dean
of students at the university.

William A. Noell Jr., currently di-
rector of financial aid and
assistant dean, will become associate
dean and coordinator of the fresh-

EC Discusses Gym Thetts,
Possible Student Trustee

Joim F. Zink

The Executive Commitice focused
its attention during the first meet
ing after the spring break on the
rising problem of equipment loss in
the gymnasium: Rouss Fletcher of
the Adhle€ec Committee reported
that about $75 worth of equipment
has been stolen since the official
opening of the facilities last year

Fletcher said that people are
signing out equipment under false
names and then failing to return the
equipment. Darcy Didier, EC mem

Mock Platform Ready

Nationwide student opinion will
form the core of the 1972 Mock

emocratic Convention Platform, to
be released tomorrow to various con-
vention officials.

The multi-faceted platform, to be
accepted during the convention by
Alaska Senator Mike Gravel for
presentation to the National Demo-
cratic Committee, will first be modi-
fied and voted upon by the state
delegations.

The Convention will be held May
5 and 6, with the platform being ac-
cepted at 7:30 the first evening.

As pointed out by a convention
official, excerpts from the platform
itself presenting its major points
would appear to be “the most radical
part of it (the platform).” He ex-
plained that the vocabulary of the
document will de-emphasize the ap-
parent boldness of the platform's
major ideas.

Major points of the platform in-
clude:

—possible abandonment of the
free enterprise system, substituted
by the nationalization of certain
corporations.

—the endorsement of busing until
such a time as various social and
economic inequities can be dealt
with,

—the legalization of all drugs
and the establishment of a nation-
wide system of methadone mainten-
ance centers for drug addicts.

—the legalization of all “victim-
less’ crimes, such as prostitution
and gambling.

—amnesty for all draft evaders
and armed forces deserters.

—the withdrawal of all military
government personnel and all busi-
ness investments from Southeast
Asia,

—retribution by the United States
through international monetary or-

Beaty, McMinn Chosen
‘Contact’ Program Heads

Jim Beaty and Mark McMinn will
head next year’s Contact speaking
symposium which is sponsored by
the Student Body and the Interfra-
ternity Council.

Beaty is a rising junior from
Memphis. He majors in pre-medicine
and philosophy. McMinn is a rising
senior from Columbia, Tennessee,
with an independent major in phil-
osophy and psychology. He has serv-
ed as Chairman of the Washington
and Lee Film Committee. Both
Beaty and McMinn were members of
the 1971-72 Contact Committee.

The Contact co-leadership was
chosen after consideration by a se-
lection committee which included
the rising president and vice presi-
dent of the Student Body, two Inter-
fraternity Council officers, and the
two previous Contact co-chairmen.
Student Body President-elect Bob
Brennan said that the final decision
was “very close” and was made only
after protracted discussions over a
two day period.

At present, the program for next
year possesses no single theme. As
McMinn explained, “It is difficult at
this early date to project anything of
a concrete nature, such as definite
speakers, dates, etc. What Jim and
I are concerned with at present is
the formulation of a basic direction
encompassing a diversity of interests
on this campus. At the same time.
it is our desire to give the program
as much depth as it can contain.”

“We will strive.” he continued,
“as far as our capabilities and limita-
tions permit, to touch every student
with at least one aspect of next
year’s program. Perhaps a main de-
parture from this year's program
will be our effort to broaden the
appeal into certain non-academic
areas.”

Contact was begun in the mid-
sixties by Washington and Lee's In-
terfraternity Council. Its themes
have included “The City.” “The

 

Professer of

Sorman PF. Lord,

Crisis in Education,” and, this year,
“Contact ‘72” which sought to spon-
sor a wide variety of speakers with
each guest dealing with a specific as-
pect of his expertise.

Since its inception, Contact has
sponsored the Washington and Lee
appearances of many prominent in-
dividuals, including Charles Percy,
Mark Hatfield, W. H. Auden, Ram-
sey Clark, and Tom Wolfe.

Page 2 THE RING-TUM PHI

 

   

|\OUTLOOK andREVIEW.

For over 70 years The Ring-tum Phi has existed at Wash-
ington and-Lee University. During that period the publication
has been transformed from a football spirit sheet to a weekly
student newspaper. The life of the Phi has been characterized
by periods of great success and eras of distinct disrepute.
Regardless of the Phi's standing, spring has been it’s annual
season of metamorphosis. Each year a fresh editor breathes
new life into The Ring-tum Phi. The transition is no different
this April. Skip Paukert has quite ably taken over the reins
of editorship and brought in a new and promising staff. Dur-
ing this period of incoming and outgoing editors, two methods
of analysis automatically come to mind, One can either recall
what the paper has done this year or one can conject about its
future. The former route seems a bit more apropos for an out-
going editor. Therefore, here is a summary, a scorecard if you
prefer, of what The Ring-tum Phi has done editorially this
year, and what it has failed to do.
ss September the Amendment XXVI_ (eighteen-year-old
vote) was cited on page two. Students were encouraged to
register and exercise their right of enfranchisement. The re-
sult—less than 20 students registered to vote locally.

Another editorial emphasized the problem of disappearing
personal property at W&L. The value of trust among W&L
men was reiterated. The results—an increase in pilfering,
locked doors in McCormack Library, identification cards in
Evans Dining Hall, hundreds of dollars of athletic equipment
unaccounted for, and obviously a decline in the Honor Code.

Parietals in university dormitories were opposed on mul-
tiple occasions. The result—abolition of parietals under the
auspecies of the University Council.

The Phi criticized the rush system calling for more over-
all organization and cooperation from fraternity houses. The
results—the Interfraternity Council has made few inroads into
improving rush and upperclassmen are currently leaving fra-
ternities at an alarming rate.

A November editorial lashed the University Council. The
student-faculty body was accused of failing in its purpose as
a forum of university opinion. The UC was criticized for ab-
senteeism, lack of discussion, shortage of planning, loss of
direction and benign acceptance of university policy. The re-
sults—later the council addressed itself to salient issues such
as coeducation, the Honor System, and independent exams.

W&L's enrollment has climbed by about 300 in seven
years. The wisdom of this population increase was seriously
questioned, Result-—it was decided to increase the School of
Law enrollment by 100 students.

When W&L finished the addition to Doremus, additional
building needs were outlined within a December editorial: a
library, dormitories, and a law school. The results—a $56 mil-
lion development plan far exceeding the imagination of most
students.

It was pointed out that the Cockpit was operating in the
red and needed to be remodeled or rearranged to turn a profit.
Result—no remodeling, no rearrangement.

The Ring-tum Phi suggested that W&L investigate a Pay
as You Earn scholarshi psystem similar to Yale's. Result-
no investigation seems to have been carried out, or even con-
sidered.

Coeducation at Washington and Lee was vehemently op-
posed in the March | edition. The results
resolution was strongly defeated 535-438.

A plea was presented for more parking space. Result-
two new lots were built

a pro-coeducation

at the foot of the abyss next to
Doremus Gymnasium,

An emotional editorial asked that W&L men be allowed
to swim naked in the old indoor pool, Result
crackdown for decency seems to have subsided,

Considering some of the problems W&L has experienced
with the College Athletic Conference, the Phi strongly sup-
ported the move by the Generals to join the Virginia College
Athletic Association. Some of the results
next year with Virginia colleges.

The overkill of election posters was lambasted. It was ree-
ommended that the posters be banned by the EC. Result
ban.

In seven of the above instances editorial stands in The
Ring-tum Phi have caused zero results, Five of the above edi-
torials were met with action although in some cases the paper
honestly had only a mild casual relationship with the action
\nd in a couple of cases, i.e. the parking problem and the
doldrums within the University Council, things have im
proved but not enough. Therefore, judging from Volume
LXXI, the power of the press appears to be less than devastat
ing. Mr. Paukert, hopefully you will generate more results

Performs

A special presentation for celloist
Pablo Casals highlighted the W&L
glee club’s recent concert tour of
Puerto Rico over spring vacation.

The special concert for the 95-
year-old master was arranged as a
result of one of the group’s five sche-
duled concerts. One of the island's
top composers, Hector Campos-Par-
si, heard the glee club’s presentation
of “Nigra sum”, a composition of
Casals’, at a concert at the Institute
of Puerto Ricon Oulture. Obviously
pleased by the performance, Cam-
pos-Parsi made arrangements for
the group to appear before Casals.

Pieces by Anton Dvorak, Orlando
di Lasso, Vincent Persichetti, Hans
Leo Hassler, and, on a more modern
note, Paul Simon, were sung by the
glee club for the noted celloist. Sim-
on’s “Sounds of Silence” and “Sear-
borough Fair” were the first of the
writer’s works overheard by Casals.

The 31-voice gless club is directed
by J. Tucker Cook, instructor in
music at Washington and Lee, The
arrangements for the tour of Pureto
Rico were due in large part to the
efforts of Glee Club president Paul
Weeks, a resident of the Island,

The Glee Club's performance of
Casal’s own works brought raves

Profiles of Three Major Democratic Contenders

The following biographical pro-
files of the three major candidates
for the Democratic Presidential
nomination were written by the can-
didates’ floor leaders at the upcom-
ing W&L Mock Convention. They
are: Ben Sherman for Humphrey,
John Hammond for McGovern, and
Mike Agee for Muskie.

—Ed.

Humphrey

Hubert Humphrey was born May
27, 1911, in Wallace, South Dakota.
In his youth Humphrey learned
the value of hard work as he work-
ed his way through the University of
Minnesota. He majored in political
science and graduated Magnum Cum
Laude and Phi Beta Kappa. He
then went on to get his master’s de-
gree from Louisiana State Univer-
sity.

In 1945, Humphrey was elected
Mayor of Minneapolis and led a
crackdown against organized crime
who had looked upon Minneapolis
as a haven against prosecution—iill
Humphrey came to office.

In human rights Humphrey was
the leader as he spearheaded a fight
for a strong Civil Rights plank at the
1948 Democratic Convention. He
carried that fight to the Senate floor
where he was its chief spokesman in
seeing that the 1964 Civil Rights Act
was passed.

Humphrey is a firm believer that
in the Youth of America lies our
greatest resources, He has worked
consistently on programs for their
benefit. Among them are federal
education loans, The Peace Corps,

Trustee Named
Navy Secretary

John W. Warner, a 1949 gradu-
we of Washington and Lee and a
member of the Board of Trustees,
was named by President Nixon last
April 7 to become the new Secre-
tary of the Navy. He succeeds John
Chafee, who resigned to run for the
U.S. Senate from Rhode Island,

Mr. Warner holds a B.S. in phy-
sics and engineering from WAL and
a law degree from the University of
Virginia, He was elected to the
Board of Trustees in 1968, when he
was a member of the Washington,
D.C. law firm ef Hogan & Hartson.

He was nominated by the Presi-
dent to the number two position in
the Department of the Navy in Janu-
ary 1969. The new Secretary had
worked with Nixon's Campaigns in
both 1960 and 1968,

Mr. Warner is the son of a dis
tinguished Washington and Lee
alumnus, the late Dr, John W. War
ner, who received the B.A. degree in
:1903 and practiced medicine in
Washington, D.C, Since 1961 a
memorial scholarship honoring Dr
Warner has assisied pre-medical stu
dents.

From 1955 until 1960, Mr. War-
ner was an assistant United States
attorney for the District of Colum-
bia, serving in the trial and appel
late divisions of the U.S, Atiorney’s
Office, and concluding with two
years service in the criminal divi
sion tfial staff for the U.S. District
Court

VISTA, The Youth Opportunity
Program, The Headstart Program,
and many others.

The quest for a durable peace has
been the keystone of Humphrey's
record, He was the sponsor for The
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the author
of the bill creating the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency
and the Peace Corps, and Food for
Peace programs.

McGovern

Senator George McGovern is a

McGovern is a graduate of Dako-
ta Wesleyan University and North-
western University in Chicago. He
holds a PhD degree in history. Prior
to his entrance into the Congress in
1962 he was a professor at Dakota
Wesleyan.

During World War Il, McGovern
served as a pilot in the Army Air
Corps and was awarded the Distin-
guished Flying Cross for bravery.

In 1960, he became a special con-
sultant to President Kennedy and
was the first director for the Food

Other full-length concerts were

was part of the United States Park
Service’s celebration of its 100th
anniversary. Also, who could for-
get singing around the Hotel Shera-
ton’s Pool with a 20 mile-an-hour
wind attempting to blow all the
music into the pool!

There was plenty of spare time to
relax, drink, gamble and run. Tours

Petters To The Sditer...

Grieg Loves Letters

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi

I am glad to see that the Phi is
finally becoming interesting reading
again. My reference is to the cur-
rent numerous debates raging in the
Letters to the Editor section. In my
four years at W&L I've seen the Phi
go from a bi-weekly four-page paper
to a weekly six-page paper to a
weekly six-page paper with no pages
3 or 4, But as | mentioned, outside
writers have come to the call, and
through their letters made the Phi
exciting.

In recent issues some healthy con-
troversy has arisen in the form of
1) students against Mr, Dick Miller;
2) Black students versus White stu-
dents; 3) students versus the univer-
sity “medical” services; 4) drunk,
hell-raising, obscene fraternity mem-
bers versus “sober, less than qualifi-
ed critics”; 5) an unhappy loser; and
6) a slur on poor Bert Meem. | ap-
plaud all who wrote either initiating
or concerning the above, for they
have made it worthwhile to trek to
the library to get a Phi.

1 would like to stir up some nests
and jump on this letter-writing band-
wagon. Where was page 3-4 in the
March 29th issue? Isn't that like
putting page number 15 at the top
of the last page of your eight page
statistics term paper? And further, I
think that Bert Meem is owed an
apology for being included in that
stupid letter in the 3-29 Phi.

nor defend, per se. | consider the

Case No. 2: On any given Sunday
this winter, one might have noticed
activity within the old gym, that last
great old bastion of white supre-
macy. Inside, believe it or not, were
youths of both races (of the Lexing-
ton Recreation League), playing bas-
ketball side by side, enjoying the
Miller-sanctioned use of the gym for
their games.

Case No. 3: Today, April 3, Mil-
ler entered the new gym while a
white law student and | were playing
basketball with some blacks from
Lexington High School. He politely
asked those who weren't W&L stu-
dents, or sons of parents working on
campus to leave, upon request, he
allowed us to finish the game then
in progress.

| regret that | do not know Jon
Swann, and know nothing of the Jon
Swann Incident save what | have
read in the paper. Unfortunately, the
student who took it upon himself to
circulate the anti-Miller petition ad-
mitted, when asked, admitied that
he knew nothing more of the incident
than |. My only contention here is
that if one decides to publicly attack
another for an alleged injustice, he
should take the time to question the
parties involved, or at least, for
Christ's sake, one of them, I remind
those who blithely signed the peti
tion that they have publicly made
serious charges against an individual
who, unlike themselves, permanently
resides in the Lexington community
I hope they undertook such action in
good faith and in full knowledge of
the facts. To think of them doing
less is rather pitiful

A lot is heard these days about

“What can | do?” A great many
students on this campus clearly don't
care, for care of the environment in-

Studenis might counter “But I

often rush to some place only to
stop to talk to a friend for several

One is in harmony with nature, One

How can this damage be stopped?
I see only two ways: rules and fines
could be made very great—doubt-

respect and this seems
doubtful, If the students would only

W&L to Host Rugby see

N.C. Championship

This week the National Collegiate
Rugby Championships will begin at
8 a.m. on Saturday April 29 when
Washington and Lee takes on Prince-
ton University on the Upper Rugby
Field. Matches will be played thro-
ughout the day with quarter-finals
beginning at | p.m. and semi-finals
at 5 p.m.

The Championship game will be
held on Sunday at 2 p.m. on Wilson
Field. Wilson Field has been do-
nated by Washington and Lee Uni-
versity to the Rugby Club which is
sponsoring the Championships; but
there will be an admission charge of
$1 to defray the expenses incurred
in running the Championships,

The teams participating in the
two day competition are Prince-
ton, Harvard, Brown, Navy, Ten-
nessee, Kentucky, U.Va., South
Carolina, Georgia, LSU, Texas,
Michigan, Notre Dame and Palmer
College.

The Washington and Lee Rugby
team dropped a pair of games to in-
trastate rivals this weekend. The
ruggers were defeated 14-3 by Wil-

liam and Mary on Saturday and
24-4 by VMI on Sunday, The “B”
team also lost to VMI 18-0.

The William and Mary Contest
was delayed 2% hours by rain and
when finally played the field turned
quickly into a quagmire. The mud
worked to the Generals disadvantage
as speed merchants Rob Hessler and
Lat Purser were unable to break
away while the slower and heavier
William and Mary team was able to
wear away at the scrum, The W&L
team led 3-0 at the half but fell
apart for two minutes at the begin-
ning of the second half allowing 10
points by the Indians,

On Sunday, the party weekend and
previous day's injuries took their
toll as Washington and Lee never
really got untracked. The giant Key-
det machine rolled for its first score
with ten minutes gone in the first
half. Following this the Keydets con-
trolled the game throughout, Charlie
Gregory was an outstanding player
in this losing effort, scoring the only
try and contributing greatly to the
scrum effort.

mann’s performance but turned in a
good game making 12 saves,

Sunday's victory brought W&L’s
record to 8-1, the only loss being to
third-ranked Navy, Navy has beaten
Virginia and lost only to Maryland,
who has beaten everyone in sight.
The USILA ranking showed W&L
in the seventh position behind Tow-
son State, and UVa. in fourth. A
win over Towson and a good show-
ing against Virginia should assure
the Generals of a berth in the cham-
pionship tournament.

WA&L’s lacrosse team went 2 for 3
over during Spring break, beating
Massachusetts and Connecticut Wes-
leyan but losing to powerful Navy.

Goalie Skeeter Chadwick led The
Blue’s 9-5 win over Massachusetts,
chalking up 21 saves. John Lalley
paced the scoring with 3 goals. Sam
Englehart and Skip Lichtfuss each
scored 2, Ted Bauer and Brian Chas-
ney chipped in | apiece for the
Generals.

balls from the Middies, 62-59. Bauer
and Lichtfuss each scored twice and
Lalley, Englehart, Tognetti and
Neese scored once as the Blue was
held to its lowest point total of the
season

Sam Englehart scored seven goals

to a 13-6 victory over Washington

Generals one step closer to a na-

Despite the seven goal difference,

erals rallied for four more runs, A
single by Don Hathway, a freshman,
was followed by a walk to Grayson
Fitzhugh and a double by Jim Nolan
which scored two runs. The inning
was capped by a two run homerun
by Bo Brookby. The final score was
9-5 with Grayson Fitzhugh picking
up the victory in relief of the starter
Rod Ferrendino. The next day in a
windy rain abbreviated seven inn-
ing ballgame, the Generals behind
the strong pitching of Captain Ellie
Gutshall, beat Oneonta 9-4, The
heavy hitting was provided by a two
sun-scoring double by Scott Breen, a
homerun and suicide squeeze bunt by
Dave Traylor, 4 RBI’s, and a triple
by Doug Clelan which scored three
runs. The game was finally called
after seven innings, and the final
score Was 9-4,

On Monday, April 10, the Gen-
erals opened their Florida schedule
optimistically against Florida Pres-
byterian. However, in this game and
in the three remaining games the
team did not play as they had four
days earlier on Smith Field in Lex-
ington, Putting aside the usual ex-
cuses of bad umpiring, excessive
heat, and bad hops, the team was
clearly plagued by a rash of fielding
miscues, Texas League singles, and
stranded base runners, In each game
the impossible continued to occur

Florida Presbyterian twice, 8-2, 5-2;
to St. Leo, 15-2; and to Tampa, 13-4.
Overall the Florida trip produced
a 0-4 record, a season's record of 3
wins and 6 defeats, and a dishearten-
ed team. Why disheartened? The
Florida teams were good ballclubs,
but not unbeatable. Had the team
played tighter defensive ball and
produced more than their meager
average of two runs a game, the
trip would have been much different.

Bright spots were few during the
trip, but there were two very notice-
able ones. One was the emergence
of Don Hathway as the team’s lead-
ing hitter and a fine defensive ball-
player. At the end of nine games,
Hathway was hitting at a .538 clip
and also had five RBI's. The second
bright spot was the fine pitching per-
formance turned in by Haller Jack-
son, Jackson worked eight innings
against Florida Presbyterian giving
up only two earned runs, Although
he lost the game by a 5-2 score,
Jackson exhibited a live fastball,
two good breaking curve balls, and
a vast amount of maturity and poise.
Overall, Jackson leads the pitchers
with a 1,59 ERA, Other team lead-
ers are Jim Nolan hitting at .387
and Dave Traylor with three home-
runs and eleven runs batted in,

Both games this past weekend
were cancelled due to rain. The
Generals face Hampden-Sydney
away this Friday but return home
Saturday to meet Richard Bland in
a doubleheader.

and that “26,500 men are on aler
or standby for shipment to South
east Asia.” No sources of informa-
tion are given, the government has
said little, if anything, concerning
these movements, and | have been
unable to find any confirmation of
these charges. How can we be sure
NSA is telling the truth?

NSA siates that: “In January
there were 45 B-52’s in Southeast
Asia, today there are over 150.” At
the time the poster was printed,
there were 80 B-52’s in Guam and
Thailand, with 20 more on_ the
way over, 80 plus 20 equals 100,
not 150, Source: Time, April 17,
1972, pg. 37.

NSA that: “In January,
there are nine.” This is a lie. There
were 4 carriers there as of NSA’s
printing, with a Sth and 6th on the
way. Source: Time, April 17, 1972,
pg. 37.

NSA charges that: “The White
House has hinted that it was con-
sidering sending U.S. ground forces
into “rear areas” to. . . maintain
the troops of dictator Nguyen Van
Thieu.” NSA then calls Thieu “the
president of a corrupt and repres-
sive regime .. .” In fact, “The Presi-
dent directed that the 6,000 USS.
combat troops currently stationed in
Vietnam should not be shifted from
their defensive positions . . . to aid
ARVN’s fight against the North
Vietnamese.” (Time, April 17, 1972,
pg. 36.) The terms “dictator”, “cor-
rupt and repressive” could apply to
many governments, including that
of North Vietnam. Also, NSA for-
gets that Thieu received a 97°,
vote of confidence last year, with
the world watching, and his nation
under assault,

NSA concludes by stating that
“Richard Nixon has exposed his
concept of a ‘generation of peace’

Muskie

Of all the Democratic contenders,
Senator Muskie of Maine has had
the broadest top-level experience in
both legislative and exectitive
branches of government.

As Director of Price Stabilization
for Maine (1951-52) he successfully
administered the campaign against
inflation in that state. He won praise
from both businessmen and con-
sumers for his administration of the
controls,

As Governor of Maine for four
years (1955-59) he significantly up-
graded state schools, hospitals and
mental institutions, He also brought
about reforms in Maine’s prisons,
spured the state’s economy and in-
stituted programs to improve the
water quality in Maine’s rivers,

As a United States Senator for the
past 13 years, Muskie has built a

reputation as one of the most effec-
tive and respected members of that
body.
