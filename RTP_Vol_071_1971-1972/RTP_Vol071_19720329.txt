Rusk Addresses ODK Meeting;
20 Students and Alumni Tapped

BY PAUL LANCASTER

A total of 20 Washington and Lee
alumni and students were “tapped”
into Omicron Delta Kappa, the na-
tional leadership fraternity founded
at W&L, in a ceremony held yester-
day in Lee Chapel. The ceremony
was highligted by a speech by for-
mer U.S. Secretary of State Dean
Rusk,

Glenn Azuma, president of the
Alpha chapter of the ODK, which
was founded here in 1914, qualified
those tapped as “men of a high
standard of efficiency ... the repre-
sentative men of college life
and (those) bringing together the
faculty and student body on mutual
interests and understanding.”

After the tapping, Rusk delivered
his speech upon the theme, “You
and those in school with you are
destined to make up a unique chap
ter in the history of the human race.”
He cited this statement as one being
repeated many past genera-
tions, but he also went on to qualify
the statement through a discussion
of five major questions, These ques
Rusk theoried, were the ones
which today’s youth

upon “must

reach a solution before the end of
ihe century,”

The Rhodes Scholar first turned
io the question of nuclear weapons.
There are now thousands of mega
ns of nuclear weapons lying
around in the hands of frail human
beings,” he stated. “We had our
chance to pick ourselves up after
World War II. We shall not have
a chance to pick ourselves up afte:
World War III,” Rusk grimly stat
ed, referring to the devastating
force of present nuclear stockpiles.

“How do you prevent World War

111?” he asked. “Armament con-
tinues the (arms) race is mov-
ing.” He noted that within only a
few years we will multiply three- or

four-fold our cache of deliverable
nuclear weapons in this “race that
is inherently mad.” He noted that
even at present stages, “Each (the
U.S. and the U.S.S.R.) can destroy
the other no matter who strikes
first

Rusk consequently noted that the
solution of a “durable peace” lies in
many elements, particularly the
“deepening and broadening of in
ternational law.” Rusk is a profes-
sor of international law at the Uni-
versity of Georgia.

Finally, Rusk hypothesized, the
country must seek to accomplish
“major realignments of goals in
economic fields.” He flatly stated

lation while utilizing “almost 50
percent’ of the world’s resources.

distribution of the world’s economy.

Black Focus

 

BY JOHNNY E. MORRISON

“The Identity defined by action
is present and past; it may also fore-
tell the future, but not necessarily
so.”” —Allen Wheels

This year’s Washington and Lee
University Democratic Mock Con-
vention has set out to forecast the
future. The question remains to be
answered. Who will be the lucky—
or perhaps unlucky—one to be
nominated to represent the Demo-
cratic Party in the 1972 Presiden-
tial election?

Many intricate problems are con-
fronted whenever one tries to kick-
off something of the Mock Conven-
tion’s nature. Everybody, from the
chairman of the Convention on
down to the state delegate repre-
senting his respective state, must
have a total commitment if the
Mock Convention is to be a success.

If one thinks that the Mock Con-
vention can be organized with sim-
plicity and apathy among the state
chairmen, then he is totally mis-
taken. The state chairman is con-
sidered one of the most important
offices. The selection of the chair-
man is done selectively because he
is the battery of the convention.

he first task of a state chairman
is to organize his delegates and to
try to show them the importance of
being a body of workers dedicated
to making their state the best or-
ganized representation. The state
chairman's delegation comes from
volunteers and as time progresses,
its number dwindles. This comes
about because of the hard work and
pressure which increases as the Con-
vention day approaches. A_ state
such as California with its seventy-
plus delegates functions in an or-
rainized manner, through various
committees which can keep every-
one busy.

There are many responsibilities
charged to each state delegation.
rhe major responsibility which each
bears is that of acquiring
money. Whenever the word money
is mentioned, people sometimes tend
to become uneasy. The state chair-
men are not immune to this feeling
of uneasiness because after all, they
are human too. The budget for eact
state includes expenses for station-

scale

ery and posters, telephone calls,
and accommodations for visiting
dignitaries, There is also the cost

of the various parties and entertain-
ment festivals which are carried on
by various states. The type of enter-
tainment and parties is left up to
the state chairman's discretion. Each
siate is responsible for displaying

The Mock Convention

a float representing their state. The
costs range from fifty to one hun-
dred dollars.

One of the problems that a state
chairman confronts is the knowl-
edge about his state’s actual conven-
tion. A state chairman usually re-
medies this by performing as much
research as possible. When this pro-
cess is in operation, the state chair-
man may confront political leaders
and panty chairmen of his state who
are reluctant to relinquish informa-
tion, The reasons for this action
vary, but the most prevalent one is
the lack of time the real political
leaders and state chairmen have.
Most of these men are professional
lawyers, businessmen, doctors, etc.-
and are always pressed for time.
This handicap is usually alleviated
by getting Virginia’s Democratic
State Chairman to contact the states
who did not respond originally.

To know the political mood of
the state is also of great importance
to the state chairman. It is his duty
to know how the state he represents
feels about certain issues and how
each candidate stands on these is-
sues. Most of this information is
gathered by talking to the political
leaders and state chairman of each
state. Another path is reading the
state’s major newspaper and trying
to deduce which “hot”
and which are “cool”.

Phe Mock Convention will not be
in the shadow of knowledge because
it is one event which is considered
of great importance to many of the
political aspirants of Democratic
National Convention. Most of this
is due to past publicity and the
Mock Convention's almost perfect
record,

The true mark of excellence when
discussing the Mock Convention is
its ability to represent the many
different sectors of the political soc-
iety. Here, at the Mock Convention,
we have 200 plus students trying to
fore-cast how millions and millions
of Americans will vote in Novem-
ber. Mike Campilongo, co-chairman
of Washington and Lee’s Mock Con-
vention, summed up the main goal
of the Convention as being “able to
be as diversified as possible to be a
true representation of a diverse soc-
iety.”

Although the students who make
up this Mock Convention are not as
American people,
their success in trying to exemplify
a diverse society will be seen by
whomever is nominated at Washing-
ton and Lee's Democratic Mock
Convention.

of student life and weld them into
a unity to promote the best inter-

University. Some of the other foun-
ders were student instructors so in
some sense this represented a group
of rather serious minded students
who were earnest in their desire to
contribute anything they could to
the best interests of the University.
We already thought of ourselves as
being public spirited and willing to
serve the University in anyway we
could,

So the two of us talked over
things and when we had some gen-
eral agreement we went to see the
president of the University, Dr.
Henry Lewis Smith, and he seemed
to have liked the idea, We talked to
Dr. De La Warr B. Easter who was

idea and gave us some advice and

the mental midgets congregating on

their masculinity and shouted ob-

of thing is not unique to the frater-

Significance Of ODK Explained

ous phases of student life in those
days,

We had a public announcement of
the fact that Omicron Delta Kappa
had been organized. This was De-
cember 3rd or 4th, 1914. We
thought of it as primarily for the
Washington and Lee campus, but it
wasn't long until others became in-
terested. They established a circle
at Johns Hopkins University, then
the next one was at the University
of Pittsburgh,

Ring-tum Phi: Have you noticed
any basic changes in ODK since it
was founded?

Latture: Surprisingly enough | really
think it has continued essentially
as it was originally conceived, There
is a good deal of flexibility in the
organization from school to school,
from small schools to big schools.
So it is not a very rigid organiza-
tion. I think sometimes a school
which does not have Phi Beta Kap-
pa tends to use ODK as almost the
equivalent of what Phi Beta Kappa
represents in the schools which do
have that society,

In many schools it has a great

deal of prestige and is very active.
In some schools they are directing
recreational activities, fund raising
drives and things of that kind, which
has not been true here. The idea
on our campus has been for the
most part to discuss, more or less
behind the scenes, the nature of
problems on the campus and then
to encourage different groups, be-
ginning with the Executive Com-
mittee of the student body and other
organizations, to serve in these areas
as successfully as they can. So that
has been the way in which the pur-
pose has been carried out in differ-
ent schools. Here it has been rela-
tively modest in its achievements
and in its publicity. In many schools
it has a more conspicious public
image than on our campus.
Ring-tum Phi; Could you tell us
what ODK means to you person-
ally?
Latture: Of course, | have taken a
very deep personal interest in ODK
all along and | have had an excep-
tional opportunity to be associated
with Alpha circle from the begin-
ning and have witnessed nearly all
of the elections in the past. I was
away from the campus for 4 years
but otherwise I have attended all
of the election meetings and practic-
ally all of the meetings held for any
purpose in all that time. I am con-
fident that the central idea is a
sound one of bringing people to-
gether who have different interests
and different points of view to dis-
cuss and exchange ideas and to try
to work out differences of opinion
and promote some idea of policy
that is of significance for the Uni-
versity.

| might say that I have had the
view that where ODK is active and
effective a great many issues be-
tween faculty and administration
and students could be resolved with-
out too much adverse publicity or
conflict. The idea of course is to
have students, faculty members, and
members of the administration in a
situation where they can express
themselves freely and frankly and
come to a mutual understanding
under conditions that ought to be
constructive and helpful to all con-
cerned.

Now
ally, I

of course, for me
think | would say that the
most valuable experience that I
have had is to become better ac
quainted with the members of ODK
| have became better acquainted
with many boys through ODK and
within the past few days actually I
have written notes to 15 or 20 alum
m whom | remember as members
of ODK. | could of course wish that
ODK were more active than it is
One of the big problems with re
gard to ODK is that we elect most
of the members as seniors and they
are soon gone from the campus
Also, we have a relatively
number of seniors and they are not
a sufficient number to wield
of influence on the campus
There are so many other organi
vations. for example, the Executive
Commutiee and the Student Con
trol Committee, so ODK is largely
an hon organization somewhat
comparable to Phi Beta Kappa. It
is essentially a

Ring-tum Phi: Do you believe that
ODK has had a significant effect on
the W&L campus?

Latture: | think that in the earlier
days when the student body was
smaller it was able to wield a more
significant influence than at present.
As I have said the other organiza-
tions have taken over many of the
functions that might have been exer-
cised by ODK,

I might give as an illustration the
fact that we had a hazing problem
on the campus when ODK was or-
ganized. There was what we called
indiscriminate hazing. A few boys
would take some freshman or other
unpopular boy and give him a good
beating, and that was sometimes
seriously objectionable.

One of the first things that ODK
did was to try to solve that problem
by setting up what we called an As-
simmilation Committee which func-

tioned effectively until fairly re-
cently .Now the Student Affairs
Committee and Student Control

Committee have taken that over but
for many years the Assimmilation
Committee, which was made up of
responsible persons, gave offenders
a hearing and avoided the violence
or the hazing that had been prac-
ticed on the campus before.

We also sent students to speak to
high school groups and preparatory
school groups to possibly recruit
new students. Also I recall one in-
cident in which a group of students
was very much displeased with the
University physician and they were
getting ready to have a big spread
in the Ring-tum Phi attacking him.
ODK was able to talk to the leaders
of that group and persuade them to
appoint one person, who was a
member of ODK to go to the phy-
sician and tell him what the com-
plaints were. That happened and
the problem was solved; there was
no outburst, and nobody was hurt.
It accomplished a purpose in a quiet
but effective way. So I think ideally
that is what ought to be done.
Ring-tum Phi: What do you feel is
the role of ODK on today’s cam-
pus? Has it remained meaningful
and what is the future of the or-
ganization?

Latture: | have already intinvated
that its present role is that of recog-
nizing student leaders as far as that
is possible. To be chosen from the
student body is apparently still rec-
ognized here as an honor. It is what
we would call a prestigious organi-
zation. I think that's generally true.
I have heard it said on many a
campus that ODK would rank with
Phi Beta Kappa. It interests me that
even alumni who are invited back to
honorary membership will travel
halfway across the country to be
here to be tapped. And I think that
indicates that it does command
some respect off the campus as well
as on the campus.

There certainly is an opportunits
for leaders to get together and to
consider questions that are of im
portance to the campus and to try
collectively to do something abou!
it, As to what the future is, | know
that there are still applications be
ing made to the national organiza
tion for charters in other schools
Right now there are 3 other schools

Stickmen Dispose of UMBC, 17-7

BY BILL BALLARD

After winning three — straight
games W&L coasted home with a
17-7. victory over University of
Maryland, Baltimore County, Sat-
urday afternoon,

The defense, Don  Eavenson,
Harry Rogers, Tom Smith, and
Jimmy Farrar, seemed almost invul-
nerable. While goalie, Skeeter Chad-
wick, shut out UMBC in the first
half, he had only four saves to his
credit. Coverage was very aggressive
and close; the defensemen and mid-
fielders were able to go after their
opponents because they were back-

ed up and were able to
when overcommitted.

The offense was equally impres-
sive. They scored five goals in each
of the first two periods, to have a
commanding 10-0 lead at half. Skip
Lichtfuss was high scorer for the
game with four goals and two as-
sists. Jim “Piggy” McCane followed
with two goals and two assists, Nine
other players contributed to the
game total of 16 goals.

Despite the tenacious defense, the
Generals allowed the highest goal
production of the season. Chuck
Robson made seven saves but could

recover
