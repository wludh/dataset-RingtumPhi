Law School Awaits Coeds

By PAUL LANCASTER

The Washington and Lee Law
School will accept applications from
women for the first time next year.
The decision to do so came on
the recommendation of the faculty
of the School to the Board of
Trustees,

“We had been discussing it (going
coeducational) since | came down
here as Dean of the School (in
1968),” Dean Steinheimer revealed.

Roy L. Steinheimer, Dean of the

Law School, forésees no increase in
the school when it becomes a co
educational institution next fall.
“The enrollment will remain the
same,” the head of the Law School
said, “mainly because of the school’s
physical limitations.”

The decision was somewhat hast-

ened by a recent ruling of the
American Association of Law
Schools. The AALS has recently

decided to accredit only those law
schools whose admission policies are

Student Committee
Accepts $20,000 Gift

In their meeting Monday night the
Executive Committee announced a
substantial foundation grant for the
Student Recruiting Committee and
also selected the first female student
to sit on that body. The EC also
heard progress reports from the
Planning and Development Commit
tee and the W&L Pre-Law Society.

Student Body President Steve
Robinson revealed that the Hillsdale
Foundation of Greensboro, North
Carolina, has delivered a $20.000
contribution for the recruitment of
underprivileged students. The Stu-
dent Recruiting Committee received
its first grant last year of $5,000,
which has already been significantly
bettered this year.

The EC also voted to select
Debby Veale, an exchange student
from Wilmington, Delaware. to sit
on the Student Recruitment body.

In further business, Mike McCall
discussed the progress made by his
Planning and Development Commit-
tee and to determine the working
status of his group. McCall said that
thus far the committee has served
in the following capacities: (1) to
help prepare present students to ac

cept the responsibilities of alumni
following graduation, (2) to improve
“town and gown” relations in Lex

ington, (3) to work with the Uni
versity's Development Office in
alumni relations, (4) to have an

active role in advising future physi-
cal improvements on campus.

McCall complained that his com
mittee did not have the sufficient
direction and back-up from the stu
dent government to perform effectiv-
ely in these areas. “When we try to
work with the alumni office or the
development office, they're not sure
who we are and what we're sup
posed to do,” he said,

Bob Brennan, a junior who also
serves on the Planning Committee,
agreed, saying “we are beating our

heads against the wall” in trying
to determine the purpose and the
status of their committee.

Rick Gray suggested that the

Planning and Development group be
made a “full-fledged” Standing Com
mittee of the EC. McCall added that
his committee has produced a maga
zine to send to alumni, but that it
has received no support fer publica

Restores Hundred-Y ear-Old Church

Jim Swann Refurbishes

By “MOON” ELLISON

The University catalogue stoutly
maintains a “common living experi
ence has been found to be valuable
during the first year of college.” If
surviving in the dorms is valuable
then living in one of Jim Swann’s
churches should rate as high with
the faculty as Saturday classes and
Lee's birthday.

Swann, a senior from Clearwater
Florida, is in the process of com
pletely renovating
his second church. The independent

not discriminatory in regards to the
applicant’s sex. Dean Steinheimer
pointed out that it would be wrong
to say that the decision “didn't
have something to do with the tim-
ing of the decision.”

The number of applications from
women is in question. “I don’t have
any idea how many applications
we'll have,” the Dean stated. “We've
been contacting girls’ schools in Vir-
ginia and elsewhere.” At the present
time, there are 252 males attending
the Law School,

The move to go coeducational was
made independently of the question
of the undergraduate school of W&I
admitting women. At the present
time, the undergraduate school
would suffer significant economic
problems if it were to go coed,
according to the President of the
University, Robert Huntley.

The Law School was founded in
1849, and it currently consists of a
faculty of 12 professors and two
visiting lecturers. Five of its alumni
have been elected president of the
American Bar Association, includ-
ing Ross Malone, vice-president of
General Motors Corp., and Lewis F.
Powell, nominee to the Supreme
Court.

Dr. Charles Light, a member of
the Law School's faculty, antici-
pates no problems in the classroom
next year. “I've taught in coeduca-
tional institutions before, and it cer-
tainly didn’t seem strange. I don't
see any great problems at all next

year,” Dr. Light remarked.
Commenting on the relation of
the decision of the AALS to the

institution’s decision to go coeduca-
tional, Dr. Light noted, “That cir-
cumstance (the AALS decision) is
obviously relevant to the problem.”
Dr. Light explained the importance
of being accredited by the AALS,
as it and the American Bar Associa
tion are the only two major ac-
crediting bodies in the United States

ing. The building is presently for
sale or rent and Swann is quick to
point out that he wants only a 20%
return on his” investment. His
motives are as uncommercial as the
structures he works with, and doesn't
seem the least perturbed about mak
quick sale. His reward, it

The decision to go coeducational
was announced two weeks ago by
President Huntley, In contrasting the
situation in the Law School to that
of the undergraduate school, Presi-
dent Huntley cited more problems
involved with the latter in  trans-
forming it into a coed school, He
noted that the undergraduate divis-
ion would have to be increased in
its enrollment by at least 30 per-
cent, for both social and academic
reasons.

However, the undergraduate ques-
tion still remains and is being closely
scrutinized for a comparison of pros
and cons of the situation, The Board
of Trustees has received a detailed
faculty report on the implications of
coeducation, and it has followed
the experiences of colleges similar
to Washington and Lee which have
recently gone coeducational.

The Law School's decision. then
will present a new facet of life at
WAL. For the first time, women will
be a full-time asset of the uni-
versity.

Supposedly, the University Council is a forum of univer-

sity opinion. It is not.
The council has become a large body characterized by ab-
senteeism, lack of discussion, shortage of planning, loss of

direction and benign acceptance of university policy.
\bsenteeism has been evident for the last four meetings
of the body. The situation was criticized in an editorial last

spring in this paper. That editorial cited some students for

shirking responsibility. This phenomenon has shown to be
contagious because administrators and faculty members have
begun to stay away. The discussion in the group has declined

Reporters are informed that the meeting is “closed” (with a

Rush Views Disputed

fo the Editor:

I wish to take issue with several
misconceptions in the editorial on
Rush in the Ring-tum Phi of Octo-
ber 27. First, to say the “preferential
card system was run quite lackadaisi-
cally” does not make sense and
quite unfair, On Monday afternoon
| personally manned a preference
card box in the Freshman Quad
from 4:00 to 5:15 in the afternoon.
At 5:20 | moved that box to the
foyer of Evans Dining Hall and
maintained it until 6:15. That box
was not unmanned at any time. On
Tuesday, October 13, at 9:00 in the
morning. the preference box was
again placed in the Quad. It re-
mained there all day, being manned
by three IFC officials at various
times during the day. It was not
manned at all times for the entire
day, but, just as on Monday, the
box was moved to Evans Dining
Hall for the dinner hour. On Wed
nesday, information was placed in
this paper explaining how to hand in
the bid cards even though the box
was no longer in operation.

ton and Lee, Lupton said, “The
Executive Committee is quite effec-
tive; it is a vital and functioning

part of student government.” Duke
Stevens stated that while it has

weak spots, “It is good. I am not
trying to knock it just help it.”

Each of the new representatives
stated that he had specific objectives
in mind for the coming year, Keat-
ley stated that his major objective
will be to represent the views of
the Freshman Class and be re-
sponsive to the majority will. The
importance of remaining in com-
munication with the class members
was voiced by Lupton. He said, “I
want to stay in touch and hear the
minor issues as well as major issues
concerning campus life.”

When asked if they believed that

on Monday, Tuesday, and the notifi-
cation in the paper, the IFC was
able to inform fraternities on Tues-
day evening, October 19, of the re-
sults of Rush (not “October 25”).
Furthermore, since that time there
have been relatively few changes in
the tabulation of fraternity member-
ship.

What may be concluded from the
results of the preferential cards?
First. some 65 people refused to
even respond to the requests of
handing in preferential cards. These
people probably either dropped out
of Rush early or have decided not to
join a fraternity. Second, frater-
nity membership is down from last
year.

The second comment in the article
that lacks clarity is the tagging of
the long S-week Rush as a “concrete
indictment against the fraternities.”
The S-week Rush plan is only the
result of a recommendation of the
Student Affairs Committee approved
by the University Council last spring.
The IFC had to follow these recom-
mended guidelines. There was no
choice. If there was, the fraternities
themselves would probably have
structured a shorter Rush.

greater than originally existed.

The UN is strikingly similar to
the League of Nations: both bodies
were powerless, both bodies lacked
leadership. and both bodies were
held in esteem only as long as the
great powers allowed them a sham
of reputability. The League collaps-
ed when it failed to prevent the
Second World War. How effective
ean any rational person. judging
from its past history and the meager
promise it provides, feel the UN
would be in preventing another
world conflagration?

The expulsion of Nationalist China
brings up an even more frightening
point: where will the UN go. now
that it has decided to pick and
choose only those nations it regards
as ideologically suitable? How long
will it be before the UN begins cast-
ing out any other nation that refuses
to agree to its lunatic plans?
though we are not in danger of ex
pulsion, since we provide one-third
of the UN's budget, still it may not
be too many years until we are the
lone non-communist nation left in
this august body

The late Robert Alphonso
once said of the UN. “Lets go it
alone.” His wise words were ignored
at the time, but it is not too late for
us to quit the United Nations. It is a
silly thing to spend money on. it is
a worthless thing to listen to. and
most importantly, if is a dangerous
body to belong to. All the aggrava

several of the new representatives
expressed disappointment at the
turnout during the recent elections.
Lupton stated that with only about
two-thirds of the class voting, he
would have liked more participation.
Stevens said, “I don’t feel that they
realize that we can help them. Some
are reverting back to the ‘high

City Plates Required

lo the Editor:

Questions have recently arisen
concerning the requirement for stu-
dents to purchase city license plates
for their automobiles, particularly in
their senior year. | believe clarifica-
tion of the policy concerning this
matter may be helpful.

City Council considered the situa-
tion of a senior student being re-
quired to purchase a license by April
15 and leaving the community a few
weeks later. Their deliberations in-
cluded similar circumstances of
other citizens who for some reason
moved from the city, and were
therefore in a position of holding a
license for an unused period of time.
Refunds for an unused portion of a
license fee is regulated by State law
which provides for such refunds only
in event of disposal of the vehicle
without replacement. City Council
ruled that senior students, like other
citizens, would be required to pur-
chase license plates.

In an effort io compensate some-
what for the rigidity of the laws
concerning refunds, the Council
adopted a policy of requiring the
purchase of license plates by stu-
dents to become effective after Oc-
tober | at the beginning of any
school year. This is the date on
which these licenses are reduced to
one half of their annual cost, and, of
course, is beneficial to students only
upon making an initial purchase of
city license plates.

The only exemption which stu-
dents who reside within the city have
from purchasing City of Lexington
licenses is that they have displayed
on their vehicle a valid city or coun-
ty license from a Virginia political
subdivision.

Changes Cause Despair

fo the Editor:

Washington and Lee is changing.

This is not surprising, for WAL is
not an isolated community, but a
microcosm of or society. Change in

itself is not bad, but most of the
changes here make me unhappy.
even despair. In particular, I see

WEL losing smallness, warmth and
ideals. Most of my complaints deal
with the “physical plant.”

The terrace in front of the old
freshmen dorm seems particularly
useless and ugly. A lot of concrete
was poured and brick laid. There
are & foot-wide sidewalks and curbs
everywhere. Why? How often will
50 people gather there? The quad
does quite well. Landscaping, like
there was before, would have done
alright.

Consider the addition to the Red
Square parking lot. at the entrance
to the school. Lawn was torn up,
and replaced by crushed stone and
concrete curbs. For $35,000 we now
have a sometimes muddy, rutty place
for our metal conveyances, where
once there was grass and where
boys played football, And it is in-
adequate. For all the parking lot
additions and improvements, there is
not enough space. | know of one
faculty member who had to park
at Wilson field or beyond because of
no closer space. WAL is truly a re
flection of the larger society. It gets
more chewed-up and uglier, and still
the problems increase. This problem
could be eliminated in a simple
fashion: everyone within a mile of
two could walk, or ride a bicycle
But people would have to change
their ways or maybe sacrifice. As ii
is now. only three or four of the
faculty, and a handful of students

Group Plans Varied Concert Series

“Without music, life would be a
mistake.” These words appropriately
sum up the sentiments of the spon-
sors of The Rockbridge Concert-
Theater Series.

Since the early 40's, the Rock-
bridge Concert-Theatre Series (not
to be confused with the Concert
Guild of W&L), has provided Rock-
bridge County with top names in
the area of fine music and drama.
With our own Dean William Watt
as its head, the series will this sea-
son sponsor four attractions, includ-
ing “The World’s Greatest Jazz
Band,” Lilian Kallir—pianist, The
Munich Chamber Orchestra and The
Turnau Opera Players.

The concert-theatre series is a
non-profit association which relies
entirely upon the financial and physi-
cal contributions of its patrons, of
whom more than half are students
at Washington and Lee and V.M.1.
The people who actually make the
program work (a board of 50 di-
rectors), are described by Dean Watt
as, “A very heterogeneous group
which arranges for performances
which they hope will be appealing to
both college students and local resi-
dents.

By LEX McMILLAN

One afternoon last month a W&L
student was walking out of his apart-
ment when he was approached by
one of Lexington’s law enforcement
officers. Establishing the identifica-
tion of the student, the officer in-
formed him that he was under
arrest, He was informed of his
rights, taken “downtown” and book-
ed. Fingerprints, picture (front and
profile) the whole thing. The charge
was conspiracy to fraud. This is a

pretty serious charge and needless
to say our fellow student was some-
what upset.

The reason for the charge was a
bad check which the student had
written to the Red Front Grocery.
Rather than following the well-
known procedures set up by the
Student Financial Relations Com-
mittee, the people at the Red Front
called the cops.

Now there might be some mitigat-
ing circumstances which justify this

Coffee House Sponsors Events

By MIKE HAMMOND

The Dutch Inn Coffee House, sup-
ported primarily by donations, is still
in operation, Since opening in Octo-
ber at least four programs have been
held on Saturday nights ranging
from folk singing to breadmaking.
According to board member Chris
Bowring the crowds have been large
and the upcoming events are equally
varied, It would seem that the Coffee
House has found a substantial foot-
hold in the Lexington community
and the W&L student body.

The Dutch Inn Coffee House was
begun a year ago last fall by a
group of Lexington townsmen and
WAL students. The group was form-
ed to give students and the com-
munity residents a place to go
Saturday nights to enjoy an eve
ning’s entertainment. The original
organizers also conceived the Coffee
House as a place to hold organiza-
tional meetings of clubs and in
lerest groups. It was available for
those who were interested in creative
writing, dancing, poetry, and relig
ion, Even more groups have applied
to use the facilities this year. The
Coffee House was organized with a
dedication to community involve

ment with as few economic hind-
rances to that involvement as pos-
sible.

By January of last year a separ-
ate project was being organized and
built within the Coffee House, The
idea was to launch a lunch pro-
gram. Necessary items for the res-
taurant business were obtained and
installed. By February the health
department had granted a license
and the restaurant opened under the
management of Christopher Bowring
and Ricky Blair. The lunch pro-
gram will open this year under
the auspices of prospective manager
Crosby Turner,

Meanwhile the Coffee House con-
tinues to provide Saturday night
entertainment consisting of student
films, guitar playing, folk singing,
poetry recitals, and appearances by
various and sundry guest speakers,
On Saturday nights the doors open
around eight o'clock, The crowds
filter into a receptive aroma of
coffee which is in plentiful supply
Other activities range from chess to
three dimensional tick-tack-toe. Rec
ords are played, and someone is very
likely to start playing a guitar. Dis
cussion groups are prominent and
any topic is likely to be discussed

The Delts received the opening

The first quarter ended with no
score, but the Delts moved the ball,

As the second quarter got under

until an interception stopped the
drive. Each team intercepted again,
and the Law School generated its
first offensive drive, mostly on short
passes to interior linemen. But the
drive stalled, and Bauer returned the

Somehow the Blue could not put

U.Va. two weeks ago, and the

in for a score six times,

The Blue were not prepared for
the razzle-dazzle Carolina strategy

with the greater UNC size and speed
gave the Tarheels the winning edge.

But all was not lost. Washington

be as great a spectator sport as any

nothing of playing in an irregular

Footlong up on Main Street was
being torn down. This gourmet

establishment was our headquarters
four years ago when we were stang-
ers to old “Lexburg,” looking for

a place we could call our own
Being the first ones in town, we
soon coaxed other freshmen upon

their arrival to partake of some of
the Footlong’s culinary delicacies.
The place featured its own singular
version of hamburgers, hotdogs, and
french fries.

But this depot was famous coun-
try-wide not for its exemplary food
but for two beverages. First of all,
it was about the only place in town
where anybody could buy Dr. Pepper
over-the-counter with food, Now,
not everybody appreciates this car-
bonated “prune juice,” | know, but
to eat a snack without a Dr. Pepper
was to some Southern boys criminal.
However, if one’s mind was not set
on this kind of refreshment (or on
another variety of liquid nutrition,
which we, as football players, were
unable to sample), then we would
purchase the Footlong’s Speciality of
the House-——a thick, creamy milk-
shake in either chocolate, vanilla, or
strawberry. For only a quarter—a
mere twenty-five pennies—we could
enjoy one of the finest treats this
side of Interstate 81.

The footlong was not an institu-
tion with its doors open to just us

selfordained “jocks.” No, sir. Our
eatery served both student and
townie alike. One thing about the
Footlong, it was one of the most
colorful night spots in this part

of the Old Dominion, Anyway, back

during the days of a one week fra-
ternity rush system, when the final
rush date of each night was over at
eleven, one of. the last places to
close (despite what it said: Monday-
Saturday, 10 a.m. to Midnight, Sun-
day, Noon to 10 p.m.) was our little
haven. We debated the merits of
one house with those of another,
munching fries or sipping succulently
on milkshakes, Many heady decis
ions were made in those rickety
booths. Then, as the school year
advanced on us, and despite its dist-
ance from the dorms, the Footlong
was still a focal point for those of
us who longed for a midnight break.

But now, the vaunted Footlong is
but a memory, one of the dozens
which embellished our first innocent
year at Washington and Lee. Per-
haps the place even qualifies for
recognition as an institution. But
whatever, the Footlong which figur
ed so notably in our past is no
longer present; a pile of charred
remains, located between the Pit
and the White Front serve as a
temporary gravestone. Main Street
Footlong, rest in peace.

Southwestern Wins 35-25;
Generals’ Offense Dies

By LEWIS HIXSON

With the stands at Wilson Field
creaking from the largest crowd of
the season, the W&L Generals
dropped a 35-25 decision to South-
western in an important CAC Con-
ference game. It was Parents’ Week-
end and both teams put forth good
efforts in making this one of the
most exciting home games in re-
cent years,

The game contained many high-
lights with each team contributing
several sparkling plays. Dave Brooks
was outstanding on punt returns as
he had two long returns of 79 and
64 yards, the first going for a touch-
down. Chappy Conrad did a good
job of punting as he averaged 46.5
yards a boot. His longest kick of the
day travelled 69 yards. Conrad also
hauled in three passes, one of them
going for a score. Tim Haley also
played a fine game on defense.

The Generals’ problems involved
a combination of things. Steve Flu-
harty was intercepted three times,
two of which proved very costly, as
they set up a pair of Southwestern
scores. The defensive secondary was
beaten several times long, one South-
western pass going tor a 50 yard
touchdown. Another problem was in
containing Southwestern’s quarter-
back; he rushed for 109 yards,

The Generals scored first on a 37
yard field goal by Doug Chase at
the end of the first quarter giving
the Blue a 3-0 lead. However, the

lead was short-lived as Southwestern
came back with a score on a 16
yard run by Warren early in the
quarter. That made the score 7-3
in favor of Southwestern, and it was
only the beginning of a 52 point
quarter. The Blue fought back for
another score following a fumble
by Southwestern on their own 26,
The scoring play came on an eight
yard pass from Fluharty into the
corner of the end zone where
Conrad was waiting. Chase’s extra
point was good and with 9:47 re-
maining in the quarter the Generals
led 10-7,

Southwestern was unable to move
following the kickoff and was forced
to punt. The punt came to Dave
Brooks on his own 21, he broke to
his right and found running room
down the sidelines. He went all the
way for a 70 yard punt return
and 6 points. The extra point made
the score 17-7 and ended the Gen-
erals’ scoring for the quarter. There
were still 21 points to be scored
before half-time and they all went
to Southwestern, The first of the

three touchdowns came on an 80
yard pass play and the next two
were running plays of three and

eight yards,

After a thrilling halftime show by
the Southwestern band, things got
under way again. Late in the third
quarter Southwestern was again
forced to punt and Brooks again
made an excellent return.

This time

he went for 64 yards before being
caught on the Southwestern 18. The
Blue moved all 18 yards on the
ground, scoring on the fifth play of
the drive on a three yard plunge
off tackle by Fluharty. That moved
the Generals within three points,
28 to 25,

Southwestern came right back
after taking the ball on their own
38 following the kickoff. They
moved the length of the field in
11 plays with Morris finally going
in from the five. That put the score
at 35-25 and that’s the way it
stayed,

Next week the Generals take on
the Coast Guard Academy here in
what will prove to be a tough con-
test. The Coast Guard will be
another big team that the Blue will
have to match up to. This will be
the last home game of the season
and one of the final two chances the
Generals have to improve on last
year’s record, The final game of the
season will be in St. Louis against
Washington on November 20.

Freshman Parietals Abolished;
Head Counselor Gives Opinion

By J. HUDSON ALLENDER

Traditions and rules have fallen
as of late around W&L like the
leaves which now cover the campus.
The last such leaf to contribute to
the pile has been weekend parietals
in the Freshmen dorms. The Student
Affairs Committee last week voted
six to four with one abstention to
remove the overnight restriction for
female visitation during the week-
ends.

Those of us who will graduate in
June easily recall a Freshman year
of no girls or alcohol allowed what-
soever in the dorms. Since then all
has transpired in a flurry and the
notion of drunken orgies in Dorm
I is now, at least, a possibility if
not a probability. The astonishing
chain of events leading up to this

crowning step by SAC began in
the Fall of 1969 when alcoholic

beverages were seen for the first
time (legally, that is) in the dorms,
The following fall brought parietal
hours to provide for female visita-
tion, the restrictions of which were
considerably liberalized during the
following year and brought the trend

As a lawyer, Huntley
Powell, “he has without exception
the keenest analytical mind I have
encountered, and is able to apply
this disciplined talent with a disin-
terested judgment which is under-
pinned by deep commitment to hu-
manity and concern for the rights

All the accolades were similar and
equally generous, and it seemed to
crown the occasion when Mr. Waller
Craig, a circuit judge on the Federal
bench in Arizona and (you guessed
it) a past President of the ABA, rose

said of

to speak for his friend, William
Rehnquist. Before he even got

around to his considerably more
desperate colleague, Craig bestowed
considerable praise on the Virginian,
saying he was one of the most
qualified lawyers in the nation.

During Rehnquist's interrogation,
all the aspirations and jealousies that
motivated the senators became ap
parent, under a guise of parliament-
ary courtesy.

On one side of the semi-circular
commitee table sat the stars of the
opposition: freshman John Tunney:
quiet, bearded Philip Hart: Ted
Kennedy (the murmurs that broke
out when he entered the room seem-
ed to suggest that Kennedy glow has
rendered the shadow of ,Chappa-
quidick dim, dimmer); and the leader
of the squad, pesky Birch Bayh of

not always coherent, but excitingly
relentless.

to the current school year.

Following the interim adjustment
period, each dorm section was al-
lowed to set up its own rules and
regulations including its own hours
for female visitation. However, there
were certain limits imposed on the
hours by the University. There were
to be no overnight guests in the
dorms nor were women to be pres-
ent between midnight and 2:00 the
following afternoon during the
week. The spirit of the University
restriction was resented and ques-
tioned by many.

A little over two weeks ago the
dorm counselors drafted a statement
to present to SAC with respect to
their views of parietals. In effect
they suggested that the overnight
restriction was hazy and _ therefore
hardly enforceable; freshmen are
more mature than they had been
given credit for and could success-
fully govern their own sections; there
is the injustice of requiring fresh-

men to live in dorms and to live
under university determined rules
without freedom of choice. After

hearing the counselors’ presentation
and discussing its ramifications fot

On the other side, the line-up
included the persistent Hiram Fong.
a surprisingly reserved Strom Thur-
mond, Charles MacMathias of
Maryland, and the prime defender
of the administration’s nominees and
one of the last men in the Senate,
since Everett Dirksen’s passing, to
display a real oratorical flair, Sena-
tor Roman Hruska of Nebraska.

In the center sat the chairman
Fastand, cigar clenched in his teeth,

representative Clarence Mitchell

were relegated to unimportance by
the symbolic absence of one man.
Phe questioning of Rehnquist was

quite a while, SAC tabled a motion
regarding parietals until they could
hear from the newly-elected Fresh-
man officers,

Freshman officers did answer
questions at SAC last Thursday and
the motion was brought off the
table. For various reasons the over-
night restriction was lifted giving
open dorms between noon Friday
and midnight Sunday for weekends.
SAC chose to keep the 2 to mid-
night limits on weekday visitation,
however, with a watchful eye on
possible study problems. This monu-
mentous bit of legislation had been
foreshadowed a week earlier when
all parietal restrictions had been
lifted for upperclass dorms.

It is now up to each section indi-
vidually to determine what hours it
wants for visitation. They can now,
however, experience overnight guests
without fear of reprimand. This is
viewed as a victory of principle —
these men can have further say over
how their lives are to be run.

So long little leaf of administrative
babysitting. What next will this
breeze of change blow off to add
to the fast-growing pile?

Then the battle ensued between
Bayh and Hruska, who claimed that
another past nominee, Thurgood
Marshall, had declined to answer
questions on matters that might ap-
pear before the court at a later
time and that no one had questioned
that then.

“After accepting a series of nomi-
nations over the years, all of a
liberal bent, | see no reason why
we should not take every advantage
of this happy prospect of two con-
servative nominees,” Hruska said,
caressing his vowels so as to get
everything he could out of each
and every word.

In the end Rehnquist did more or
less answer all of Bayh’s questions—
but not to Bayh. The fact that
Rehnquist delayed his answers until
the Republican Mathias had his turn
at questioning revealed the firmly
rehearsed political interplay that
underlies a hearing of this sort,

Many seem to foster the illusion
that a Supreme Court justice is
somehow above politics — and per-
haps as a presiding servant he is.
But beneath that outward dignity
of these hearings, there have been
obviously some intricate partisan
machinations going on — so that
when it comes time for the nominee
to open up, it is before one of the
President's men, and not before the
zealous Presidential aspirant from
Indiana.

Another fascinating story behind
these nominations is that of the act-
ual choice itself, which seems to have
arisen im numerous versions in the
dispatches of the press. Immediately
after the President's announcement
a few week's ago, the wire services.
the Post, the Times, and every major
source declared that the decision to
go with Powell and Rehnquist came
at the last minute, after the ABA
had mixed the rumored favorites,
William Friday and Mildred Lilley

But it eventually came to light,
as Mr. Powell told the Ring-tum
Phi in an interview two weeks ago,
that the decision had been made at
least 48 hours before the President's
announcement, casting an
entirely different light on the White
House decision-making.

duo now under consideration? The
choice of two such laudable
men—particularly the distinguished
Powell—has had just that effect,

for a time at least.

The final question that eventually
arises is that, if the media account
can be so inaccurate in this one
case with which we at W&L are
specifically familiar, one must ask:
how often does a crucial error by
the press delude us into the wrong
conclusion about events of which
we do not happen to be locally
knowledgeable?

Steve Robinson urged that the
Planning and Development Commit-
tee’s primary area of concern should
be to improve alumni relations. Mc-
Call said that many alumni were
surprised at changes on the W&L
campus, due to the fact that they
had not been educated as to these
occurrences through university pub-
lications.,

It was pointed out that the Uni-
versity Bulletin present a strained
effort to preserve the illusion of
conventional dress on campus. To
correct some of these misapprehen-
sions, said Lock Hanley, “it seems
to me we'd be in direct conflict
with what the administration is try
ing to do.” He agreed, nevertheless,
that this type of alumni education
must be ensued.

The newly-formed Pre-Law So
ciety outlined their purpose. and

their purpose is (1) to work with

count was closed. There seems to be
some pretty sloppy business activity
involved here but that is not the
main point of this column.

The point is that the people of
Lexington are rapidly losing any
trust or confidence they ever had in
W&L students. Students have in-
creasingly abused their privileged
position of credit which they have
traditionally had in Lexington. Last
year the number of cold checks
handled by the Student Financial
Relations Committee was phenome-
nally greater than in past years,

Another student was also arrested
for fraud last month for a bad check
to Kroger’s I don’t know the details
of this case as well as the other
but what is clear is that if you go
around carelessly writing bad checks
and expecting the Committee to keep
your records you may find your-
self spending the night (or even
longer) in jail. Hopefully, the people
of Lexington can be reassured. It
will take real effort on the part
of the students to rebuild the confid-
ence that once was there, Perhaps
most students don’t really care
enough to make this effort. Well if
