Dr. Linton Lomas Barrett, a
professor of romance languages,
critic and translator, died Wed-
nesday in Charlottesville follow-
ing a long illness. He was 67.

Only last year Dr. Barrett had
been named cooridnator of an
innovative program funded part-
ly by a grant from the National
Endowment for the Humanities
and the Council on Library Re-
sources, seeking to design a
method to increase the Washing-
ton and Lee student's familiar-
ity with the resources and serv-
ices available in the university
library system.

Dr. Barrett was the author or
translator of more than a dozen
major volumes, including 10
novels, histories and texts trans-
lated from the Portuguese, Most
recently he was translator of
“The Americas and Civiliza-
tion” by Darcey Ribiero and au-
thor of “A Simplified Approach
to Don Quixote.”

He is survived by his widow,
the former Miss Marie McDavid,
who collaborated with him on
several translations; and two
children, Arthur Lomas Barrett
of New Jersey and Ellen Marie
Barrett, a graduate student at
New York University.

The family has asked that in
licu of flowers donations be
made either to the R. E. Lee
Church or to the Botetourt-
Rockbridge Regional Library.

Born in Lanett, Ada., Septem-
ber 1, 1904, he earned his de-
grees from Mercer University,
the University of Virginia, and
the University of North Caro-
lina. Prior to joining Washington
and Lee’s faculty in 1948, Dr.
Barrett taught at Virginia, Ala-
bama, Furman, Princeton and
Kansas.

He was head of the romance
languages department at Wash-
ington and Lee for 10 years until
his retirement from adminisira-
tive duties two years ago.

Bill Merrill carried his lead from

The last minute canrpaigning by
Frierson and his unexpected endorse-

Frierson endorsements, considering
them to be “dirty politics.” The final

opponem, Jim Farrar, did not ap-
pear on the ballot. However, the
final vote gave Taylor a big lead
over all contetnders with a total of
281 votes to that of 86 for all write-
ins, Fewer students voted in the
Dance Board contest than in the
EC race.

The President-elect of the EC Bob
Brennan, has begun to assume the
responsibilities of his new office by
attending a Faculty EC meeting
concerning the future of the inde-
pendent examinations. Brennan re-
ported that the faculty agreed to

cep the independent examinations
on a trial basis. ,

Later, Brennan explained that the
independent examinations are. still
being conducted as an experiment.
He pointed out that they were not
permanent and have not proved

mselves to the faculty as of yet.
When asked how the faculty arrives
upon a judgment concerning the
future of the independent examina-
lions, Brennan said that the faculty
takes into consideration the opinions
of the students along with their own
personal observations.

Brennan expressed his opinion
that by keeping the independent ex-
aminations on a trial basis, students
will be less likely to take advantage
of them. “Right now, it is in the
hands of the students whether or
not they want to keep independent
exams. The most important thing
for the students to realize is that
they (independent exams) are not
permanem and can be lost,” Bren-
nan noted,

Commenting on the transfer of
the Freshman orientation back to

Natural Bridge for next year, Bren-
nan said, “I think it will help, The
Administration has told us that dur-
ing orientation is the time when
the new Freshman are the most in-
terested in learning about the school,
so that it is the best time to tell
them about the Honor System.”

Pointing towards a theme of the
new EC Brennan said, “What we
are trying to do is to bring the EC
back to the student level.” He ex-
pressed the concern that the EC
must become. involved in student
life and not exist as a group above
the students, Brennan said that some
people do just what they think is
better for them and have no regard
for others. He called for a “sense of
community” which would give new
life to the school. Brennan stated
that the maltreatment of the facili-
ties in the Student Center is an ex-
ample of what is wrong at W&L.
He explained,” A student can not
put himself first; this campus be-
longs to all, it is not the possession
of any individual.”

Candidates for Class offices and
EC posts were announced during
the Monday night EC meeting. They
are for Sophomore Class President:
Bill Lassetter, Chip Martin, Duke
Stevens, and Bill Biesel; for Sopho-
more V.P.: Michael Kurilecz, John

OUTLOOK and REVIE

Washington and Lee is joining a novel athletic associa-

    

tion, the Virginia College Athletic Association, The move is
engineecred-to “encourage more play among the natural intra-
state rivals.” according to W&L Athletic Director Bill. Me-
Henry. At least for the time being, the Generals will remain
associated with their current athletic conference, the College
\thletic Conference.

Actually) Washington’ and Lee: has been=a principal -pro-
ponent for this new "state-wide association Bill MeHenry ts
the group's interim vice president.

Nine schools will be VCAA members: W&L, Lynchburg,
Emory and Henry, Hampden-Sydney, Madison, Clinch Valley,
Roanoke, St. Paul's, and Hampton Institute. ‘The association
has no word from Christopher Newport, Eastern Ménnonite,
George Mason and Randolph-Macon, which have all been
approached, The criteria for membership include that the
school have a male enrollment under 2000; plus be a member
of the National Collegiate Athletic Association or the Na-
tional Association of Intercollegiate..\thleties.. Under these
euidelines Virginia Union, Virginia Wesleyan and) Luther
Rice would be eligible to join. VMI, a Southern Conference
school, has declined an offer to join.

ball, wrestling, track, cross country, tennis, golf, swimming,
and soccer, Association teams will not “be required: to play
one-another but increased scheduling among. VCAA members
is likely. McHenry reported, “We don't intend to set up the
sort of organization which would be telling people whom they
had. to play. We have too many different kinds of schools in
the state to try and do anything like that.”

The VCAA planners anticipate all-association teams and
championships. Because a football tournament is impossible,
a committee vote might decide the top team. .\ field of four
teams could be chosen for an association tournament in base-
ball and basketball. All other sports could cap off their season
with two day meets for all teams.

Washington and Lee has acted sensibly in joining the
VCAA vanguard: The University has plenty to gain by sign
ing uprand very little to lose. W&L does not have to sacrifice
its standing in the CAC. The scheduling problems might be
cased, especially in sports other than football, basketball and
lacrosse, with a statewide association of nine schools. All
VCAA teams will give outstanding W&L athletes a degree
of recognition that does not presently exist. Travel costs can
be immensely trimmed by playing teams closer to Lexington,

Certainty’ someof the Blue's fans might question this as-
sociation. They might wonder what W&L has in common
with many of these institutions except geography. The col-
leges in the VCAA are diverse in scholarship policy, admis-
sions standards and academic credibility. But recall that

W@L: Where It Has Been, Where It 1s Going... -

Library Facilities Evaluated

With the announcement of a new
$5.25 million undergraduate library
as part of W&L’s $56 million deve-
lopment program, it is appropriate
to examine the resources and prob-
lems of the current library system
and to see how well it is accomplish-
ing its goats,

“Fundamental to all other aspira-
tions of Washington and Lee are two
basic purposes:

—The dedication of all its re-
sources to the development of
man’s capacity and desire to learn,
to understand and to pass on to
others the varied benefits of this
intellectual growth.

more problem which is very ap-
parent when the harmonies of the
piano ring throughout the building.

Some limited changes are planned
in the present facilities, but there is
no intention to invest a large sum
of money with the new library on its
way. Air conditioning will be in-
stalled in the rare book room and
additional lights will be installed,
while more painting will be done
throughout the library, The one
major renovation of space will be
to create better shelving space for
new books within the limitations
of the present facilities, For ex-
ample, in the archive and rare book

 

McCormick Library will be renovated to house the School of Com-
merce, Economics, and Politics following completion of the new library.

~The pursuit of its educational
purpose in a climate of learning
that stresses the importance of
the individual, his personal honor
and integrity, his harmonious re-
lationship with his fellow man,
and his responsibility to serve
society through the productivity
of his training and talent.”
Certainly the central goal of W&L’s
library system is to support the siat-
ed aspirations of the University and
to be the central area for intellectual
advancement. Also the library seeks
“to support the intangible
cultural forces of the University.
—to create an environment
which is conducive to learning,
to developing decision-making
skills, and to the enrichment of
the total man.
to support the development
of inter-library agreements.”
McCormick Library was built ori
ginally in 1908 and was extensively
remodeled in 1941, The inadequacy
of the physical plant was seen dur
ing the preparation for the Self-
Study Report of Washington and
Lee University of 1964-66 and was
further substantiated in 1968 by a
leading library architect, Russell
Bailey, and in 1969 by Ralph Ells
worth, a professional library con
sultant, each of whom recommended
a new library
The simple lack of space in Me
Cormick and the six departmental
libraries is the most noticeable prob
lem in the current structures, Me
Cormick has room for approximate
ly 20,000 more volumes before
shelves will begin to line even the
office of the Librarian, Mr. Maurice
Leach. Also, comfortable and effic
ient working quarters for the faculty
and staff members are desperately
lacking. as evidenced by the moving
of the microfilm out of the biblio

graphy room to the rear of the
smaller study area on the main
floor, The staff is also seriously

hampered by lack of space on the
ground floor where the magazines
are checked in and the cataloguing
is done, Because of the architectural
design of the wails, which prohibits
fundamental altermtions in the sizes

mended the completion of the sixth
jack level by the installation of
storage type shelving, which would
provide space for about 40,000 vol

room new shelving will be added
for books from the fifth level of
the stacks.

The new library will hopefully
solve all of these problems and
provide facilities for much better
service. Regarding the progress with
the planning of the new facility
Mr. Leach stated, “We hope to have
the schematic drawings for the
building completed this Spring.
Once they are completed it will take
somewhere between a year and 18
months for what they call the speci-
fication drawings. Then assuming
that bids are let and the financing
complete it will take roughly two
years after that to complete the
building. Our original timetable is
geared to moving into the new
building in the summer of 1975, It
would be determined ultimately by
the financing of the building. There
is a reasonable sum of money al-
ready committed towards this end;
its roughly a third.”

Mr. Leach emphasized that the
basic idea of the new library will
be “to open up the library in the
sense of making the book and study
facilities available to the user in
one place. Le. we dont want to
create the barriers that the walls do
at the present time between the ref-
erence room and where the bound
magazines are shelved for example.”
Thus an integrated bookstack and
reading area will comprise the bulk
of the building. To provide ade
quate room for future acquisitions,
the new library will accommodate
$00,000 volumes, excluding the
Law Library

Seating will be provided for 800
patrons compared to about 530 in
the present facilities, Three-quarters
will be individual
carrels which will be less distracting
to the person studying and part of
them will be wired to enable use of
tapes or possibly T.V. in the future
Opening off the stacks will be semi

enclosed study or conlerence rooms

As President Huntiey indicated, the

Doremus Gymnasium in width and

depth, so to prevent it from tower

March 15, 1972

in the near future, which large uni-
versity libraries are beginning to
use, This decision is based on three
factors, The cost is prohibitive for
sets of books as the Encycleopedia
Britannica, i.e. ten cents a page and
thus a $40 investment for a 400
page book. Other microfilm books
are much cheaper but the problem
is the different equipment and the
staff needed to service the material.
It is not feasible to make this equip-
ment available on a_ self-service
basis. Also because Lexington is
isolated, repair workmen must be
called from Roanoke, Lynchburg, or
Charlottesville. Finally, the library
staff feels students and faculty mem-
bers prefer to handle books over
film at the present.

One of the more controversial as-
pects of the plans for the new
library is the eventual elimination
of the separate departmental facili-
ties, excluding the Law School.
There are no objections to the de-
centralized concept itself, but pro-
fessional service can't be rendered
effectively at the separate locations
and it would be more economical
to run a unified system. However,
no department will be forced to
consolidate its present holdings, but
Mr, Leach hopes they will all be
persuaded to do so, Only the Com-
merce School has consented to this
proposal so far, The departments
will be encouraged to keep “current
awareness collections” —_ including
periodicals for five to ten years,
standard reference works, and biblio-
graphical resources,

The Self-Study Report emphasiz-
ed two areas: outside the « physical
plant that needed much improve-
ment. These were the inadequacy of
the staff in terms of numbers and
the insufficient budget. At the time
of the report there were four pro-
fessional workers and two full-time
and four ‘part-time non-professional
adults. Today the staff has been in-
creased to six professionals and 12
supporting staff members. Mr. Leach
feels that this number is adequate
for McCormick Library, although
proper service for the departmental
libraries cannot be provided at the
same time. Thus considerable im-
provement can be noted in this cate-
gory.

Regarding the budget expenditures
for the library Mr. Leach feels that
“the University has supported the
library well.” The Southern Associa-
tion of Colleges and Schools recom-
mended that at least 5°, of the
total educational and general ex-
penditures of the University should
be allotted for library expenses. In
1964-65 3.3°7 of this general bud-
get went to support the library,
while in 1970-71 this figure had in-
creased to 56°). Even book ex-
penditures rose from $44,834 in
1967 to $100,534 in 1969-70, This
increase has been needed and should
continue if only to combat the forces
of inflation alone. For instance, the
average price of books in general
increased from $11.60 in 1970-71 to
$13.50 in 1971-72, a rise of 17°).

The Self-Study Report also rec-
ommended that attempts be made to
utilize any possible federal funds
Over a five year period beginning
in 1966-67 the library was given a
total of just over $31,000 by the
federal government. However, as of
this year, W&L no longer meets the
requirements necessary to receive
these funds, Because of a decrease
in the allotment of such funds in
the federal budget the qualifications
were tightened, The funds are now
used primarily in “economically-de-
prived” library situations,

The Librarian, Vir, Maurice Leach

Regarding the number of periodi-
cals available in the library, Mr.
Leach admitted the number is low
compared to most other similar in-
stitutions but he insisted that no
real complaints have been heard
from the students or faculty. The
faculty members are given the op-
portunity to check the lists of peri-
odicals in their field and to recom-
mend others each year. W&L does
subscribe to 768 periodicals by title,
and Mr. Leach noted that they are
the most expensive purchases since
they must be continued,

Attempts are being made to ex-
pand the special services rendered
by the library to the University com-
munity. One of the most important,
is in the area of inter-library agree-
ments. For at least 40 years VMI
and W&L have exchanged the au-
thor entries in the card catalogues
of each school, and it has been
agreed that each library will loan
materials on an equal basis. In
special collection purchases, if one
of the libraries has the item, then
the other will not buy it. Also the
George Marshall Library at VMI is
encouraging W&L students to use
its facilities.

Another inter-library agreement is
the Inter-Library Loan System, Un-
der this setup books are exchanged
upon request with almost any library
in the country. The service is limit-
ed however primarily to students en-
gaged in research work, as for honor
theses. W&L borrows an extensive
number of books from the Univer-
sity of Virginia, while demands
made on W&L’s books are rare. Mr.
Leach plans to issue a small hand-
book this Spring which will em-
phasize the availability of this serv-
ice. Hopefully it will be made ac-
cessible to more students in the
future.

Another example of increased in-
ter-library cooperation was exhibited
just a couple of weeks ago when
Dr. Steven McCarthy, the Execu-
tive Director of the Association of
Research Libraries spoke on issues
confronting libraries, which atiract-
ed a large number of staff members
of libraries around the state.

Mr. Leach noted that there have
been no recent complaints concern-
ing the hours that McCormick is
open for use. Extended hours are
provided during the exam periods,
and the library no longer closes on
the Saturdays of football weekends
or Fancy Dress, as it did at one
time.

A completely new program aimed
at bringing about a more effective
and efficient use of the library re-
sources by students and their pro-
fessors will begin this Spring with a
matching $50,000 grant from the
Council on Library Resources of
the National Foundation of Hu-
manities. The five year program as-
sumes that few undergraduates have
a great deal of bibliographical skill.
A course will be offered, called In
terdepartmental 190, which will at-
tempt to make the student aware of
all the library's reference services
and inter-library loan arrangements
especially in his own particular field
of study, Instruction will be given
jointly by the library staff and the
faculty of the individual Jepart-
mens, Courses will be given this
Spring by the departments of Eco-
nomics, Spanish, French, and Ger-
man, but the program will ultimate-
ly invelve more of the areas in the
Humanities and the Social Sciences.
Student assistants will be selected to
receive additional training and will
be paid to work at the reference

Letters To The Editor...

Power To The People!
To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

One truly, truly sympathizes with
the indignant junior whose letter ap-
peared in the Phi March 8, and
with the Student E.C. and indeed
with all advocates of coeducation
at W&L who imagined that the re-
cent referendum on the matter
would go their way. What we saw
here last week was another remind-
er of one of the great revelations of
modern American (and Western)
politics, viz., that the elite—the
political “classe dirigente,” the in-
telligentsia, the “socially conscious”
Jaycees and other businessmen of
the “relevant” sort—is almost al-
ways well to the left of the popula-
tion as a whole. It’s a puzzling state
of affairs for all concerned. Why,
one positively hestitates to poke fun
at democracy these days; King De-
mos is usually on one’s own side.
Evidently Disraeli knew what he
was talking about after all,

Many politicos, unfortunately,
have grasped what is happening
(even though the sponsors of the
coed referendum failed to). Just a
week ago the Virginia legislature
turned down a _ referendum bid,
aware that the voters would over-
ride an important decision which

the lawmakers were determined to
force through. Earlier, Senator Fred
Harris underscored this point in a
memorable speech at the University
of Maryland (June, 1968). And the
zealots of radical chic will tell you
any day that the intellectual-litenary
clite knows best, and that the re-
actionary demos is a blind beast.
Alas, the organizers of the referen-
dum on coeducation have probably
learned their lesson too well; when
they are themselves community
leaders, years from now, they'll
know better (unless they turn con-
servative in the meantime) than to
trust “the people” to support “pro-
gressive” causes, The next step, no
doubt, is for the Right to take over
the New Left slogan: Power to the
people!

Endorsement Criticized

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:
It was with a sense of regret that
I read the statements by Messrs.
Azuma and Robinson endorsing one
of the two candidates for Vice-Presi-
dent in last Thursday’s run-off elec-
tion, Such an endorsement is, in my
opinion, regrettable for two reasons:
1.) in an election process such as
that for the position of Executive
Committee V.P., that is one in
which there are no parties per se,
this kind of partisanship on the part
of those already in office is out of
place; 2.) such a statement provides
a supposed guide to those unfamil-
iar with the candidates in that it is
expected, or at least insinuated, that
those who signed such a statement
being elected officials should know
which is better. Being blind by their
own officialdom this is often not the
case, As it turns out, the W&L stu-
dent body has more intelligence than
Messrs. Azuma and Robinson would
give it credit for having: the record
of this year’s E.C. officers obviously
did not carry enough weight to lend
substance to their recommendations
and the candidate opposing their en-
dorsee has won. I hope that he will
exhibit more good sense and tact
during next year’s elections than did
the current President and Vice-Presi-
dent of our Executive Committee.

Liberal Arts Education?

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

With the announcement of the
new $56 million building program,
it would appear that the individuals
governing this university are making
a great effort to make W&L a na-
tional institution, Although I ad-
mire these men for their dedication
my strongest wish is that they would
take time to study why W&L fails in
its attempt to provide a liberal arts
education.

Every breath that this university
takes reflects its desire to cater to
the needs of a professional institute.
Questionnaires given to entering
freshmen show an unusually * high
percentage of W&L students desir-
ing to become lawyers, doctors, and
businessmen, The wishes of those
departments catering to these stu-
dents receive top priority. Shall we
ever see the day when W&L grants
the art, music, and drama depart-
ments the recognition and financial
support such departments receive at
more progressive universities?

The neglect of the philosophy
basic to this institution has resulted
in an administration, faculty, and
student body devoid of any creativ-
ity and characterized by a lack of
imagination,

One need not go past first semes-
ter of freshman year to discovet

that students are seldom, encouraged
to use their minds unless it is to me-
morize that “all important list” soon
forgotten. Teachers who do open up
their classes to discussion are often
puzzled by the lack of interest de-
monstrated by the students. Stu-
dents seldom take the time to even
return course evaluations distribut-
ed by a teacher,

This letter is not solely condemn-
ing the faculty, for the student body
presents a fairly bizarre picture in
itself. Living within a system so
strongly oriented to grades and
grinding, one naturally looks upon
those things he truly enjoys as hav-
ing little intellectual value. Educa-
tion cannot function when pleasure
is removed, Not only does the abil-
ity to learn decrease but what then
is the answer?

Student and teacher should co-
operate to find what they both de-
sire from their educational inter-
course, Course format should be
open to constructive criticism. Ex-
perimentation with student-initiated
courses might result in an improved
course selection for the whole Uni-
versity, While the independent study
program freed from rigorous con-
trol dutifully provided by bureau-
cratic committees would allow stu-
dents to pursue personal interests.
Professors who realize this need are
now forced to cover for students
who wish to initiate their own sub-
ject material. The sad fact is that
these are the students who are seek-
ing an education and their needs are

LaRue’s Pressbox
Honor System and Jocking it Up

BY BOB “Lash” LARUE

his column should be the last
place that anyone would find a dis-
cussion of the Honor System. In-
deed, some might even look upon
this space as a refuge from the
heady stuff on page one. Yet here
it is on the sports page. What con-
nection does the Honor System have
to do with jocking it up?

While articles have been disap-
pearing from the campus with some
frequency in recent years, the Ath-
letic Department has remained re-
markably free of major thefts. Un-
til now, that is. In the last two
weeks, several items have been “li-
berated” from the locker area be-
neath the stadium. Although none
of the items are expensive by them-
selves, the sum of their loss easily
‘xceeds $100. Missing are a half
dozen wool and cotton undershirts,
known as “fifty-fifties”, which sell
for ten dollars each; several baseball
caps at about three and a half dol-
lars each; a number of cotton under-
shirts, five dollars apiece and untold

belts, and even a pair of baseball
shoes
This equipment was removed

from the players’ lockers or from
the table on which some of it was
piled. Hung up one day, gone the
next, why? Probably for the novelty
of having taken something, or per-
haps to have something emblematic
of W&L. That is, | doubt that any
of the goods will wind up in a pawn
shop, deposited by a cash-short thief

These five-fingered discounts were

most likely students who felt they
had better use for the articles stolen
than did the players.

And still is ask, why? I mean, I
understand (sort of) the motive, but
the reasoning is unfathomable. What
is it about people that allows them
to walk in, see something they like,

W&L. To Host: NCAA
Championship Thursday

The NCAA | College Division
Swimming. championships open. this
Thursday in the new W&L natator-
ium. Bim Clark and. Bill Brother-
ton in the freestyles along with the
440 freestyle relay, composed of
Clark, Brotherton, Sharp and Cat-
lin, will. represent the mighty Blue
against 375 of the top college divi-
sion swimmers in the country.

Bill Milne,.a sophomore. at Johns
Hopkins University, is entered in
six events this. weekend.

Milne has the best time recorded
this year in six events. And in most
cases his nearest. competitor is sev-
eral seconds., behind him. For in-
stance, in the 400-yard individual
medley, Milne is seeded No. 1 with
a time of 4:18.1. His closest com-
petitions No, 2 seed Dean Hardy of
the University of South Florida,
whose best time is 4:26.9.

In the 500-yard freestyle, Milne
has recorded a 4:48.0. The next best
time is 4:54.2 by Alan Cardwell of
the University of Alaska.

Because of Milne, Johns Hopkins
is a strong contender for national
team honors, along with last year’s
defending national champion,
University of California at Irvine.
Other strong favorites are Eastern
Michigan, Springfield, Kenyon and
South Florida, which was runner-up
to UCal-Irvine last year.

Individuals who are expected to
place high, besides Milne, include
Kenyon’s Richard James, South
Florida's Ricke Morehead, Mark
Roy of Monmouth, Jeff Rogers of
Ashland, Western. Illinois’ Ramsey
VanHorn, Jim Fergus and Jim
Cooper of UCal-Irvine, Steve Bat-
tin, Jerry Roster and Jeff Lamb of

Chico State, Antherst’s Gary. Haag,
Mark Horning of Johns Hopkins,
Pete Sansone .of Springfield,..Haru
Naito of Oneonta, State. and + Deni-
son's Henry: Netthing.

Springfield will be heavily favored
in the relay. events, having posted
the best times-this. year .in both the
400-yard medley relay and the 400-
yard freestyle relay. Their. strongest
competition. is expected to come
from the :relay.. teams of Eastern
Michigan, UCal-Irvine,» Kenyon,

Lacrosse Opens Season,
Roanoke Here Friday

BY BILL BALLARD

Friday afternoon, the lacrosse
team opens its season in the friendly
confines of Wilson Field against
Roanoke College. WAL did not lose
at home last year, but Coach Dick
Szlasa is concerned about the first
four games, all at home. He em-
phasized that not one of these is an
cusy game.

Despite the fact that W&L beat
Roanoke in a scrimmage last year,
and again this fall, Roanoke is not
a team to be underestimated. They
are loaded with underclassmen,
who showed a lot of composure in
a loss to Duke. Following the bus
trip to Raleigh, Roanoke gave up
five quick goals but buckled down to
play Duke even for the remaining
three quarters of the game.

Williams, likewise, looked good
while playing under adverse condi
tions. They scrimmaged Hofstra,
who was in the national tournament
last year, at Hofstra on Astro-turf.
The game is apparently very differ-
ent on this type of surface, yet Wil-
liams Jost just 3-1, They have a
sophomore all-division goalie, a
solid defense and will run three mid-
fields, deep by any standards.

The third opponent in four days
is Ohio State, While many people
do not regard midwestern lacrosse
too highly, they may recall that
WAL held a few scrimmages against
Ohio State, about three yoars ago,
and never beat them. Ohio State
had a 7-4 record last season and
can be counted on to have a supply
of good athletes who will run and

hit.

Although the fourth game, against
University of Maryland, Baltimore
County, is only eight days after the
first, the two which intervene are
enough to make it seem like a dis-
tant contest, Coach Szlasa feels that
these four will set the tone for the
season, Despite the exam and spring
break, the teams lessons will carry
over.

One lesson it should have learned
is the value of running. In scrim-
mage Saturday, Maryland came out
running and ran until they went in,
The scrimmage proved worthwhile
by allowing mistakes to be made
now rather than in a game. Coach
Szlasa said that the defensemen,
John Rogers, Tommy Smith, Jimmy
Farrar and especially Don Eaver-
son, played well. In the goal, Skeet-

er Chadwick had a much better day
than against Mount Washington.
Disappointment lay in the perfor-
mance of the midfields, supposedly
the strength of the team. John Lal-
ley proved an exception to this, and
the relocation of Ed Tognetti at mid-
field seems to have the right move.

Monday's game against Williams
has a special meaning to Coach
Bill McHenry. He was head lacrosse
coach there ,for three years, turning
out a good record and some excel-
lent players. While at Williams, he
was selected as head coach of the
North All-Stars in the North-South
game and faced a South squad
headed by his brother, Bob.

The first three games, on week-
days, will begin at 3:15, and the
fourth, on Saturday ,will begin at
2:00.

Ruggers Fall to Old Dominion,
Beat UNC: Face American Next

The WAL Rugby team bounced
back from their 11-10 defeat at the
hands of Old Dominion to crush
previously undefeated University of
N.C, 18-12 this past Saturday, but
fell to Duke the following day as
a combination of injuries and fati-
gue plus a strong, fresh Blue Devil
team led to numerous errors and a
40-3 drubbing.

Saturday, led by backs Tom Bar

ton and rookie Lat Purser, the Gen-
erals got two breakaway scores as
the whole Carolina defense was left
in the dust of a poorly kept field,
Fullback and captain Fred Fletcher
gained back his kicking touch as he
scored 10 points. Six of these pro
vided the first half point margin of
12-0, The second half was a com-
bination of tenacious defense by the

Track Opens
March 22 Here

BY HUD ALLENDER

Coming off an encouraging indoor
season, the Washington and Lee
track team should_offer stiff competi-
tion to those it will meet on the
track and. in the  fielg. this Spring.
Coach Norris Aldridge and his
squad have developed a number of
bright prospects which promise to
reverse the previous trend in W&L
track. We have some definite win-
ners.

The indoor season has served in
the past as basically a prelude to
the outdoors in the Spring. How-
ever, this winter has proivded our
track fortunes with some highlights
in its own right, At the Lynchburg
College Invitational Indoor Relays
on February 26, the Generals took
an overall fourth place in the six
team field. However, it was. more
the individual performances which
were encouraging.

In a day of team reldy action the
Blue harriers started off on a su-
perb note by taking the mile relay
in a good time of 3:39.8. The team
of Tim Fowler, Steve Darsie, Dave
Lawson, and Brandon Herbert fin-
ished well ahead of the other teams
teams in the impressive victory.
This same quartet in a tri-meet last
week again at Lynchburg College
bested the field and coasted to an

isy 3:38.6 victory. They capped
off the indoor season last week at
the State Meet at VMI in good form
with a fourth place finish in the
State in an excellent 3:32.0, The
emergence of a formidable mile re-
lay team is a just indication of the
improving fortune in W&L track.

Another reversal of previous per-
formance is the strong dominance
of the track over the field events.
The best we could muster up in the
tri-meet at Lynchburg in filed events
was a fourth place-in the high jump.
On the track, however, Bob Sher-
wood won the mile in a convineing
4:39.1, Brandon Herbert and Dave
Lawson finished one-two in the
600-yd. dash. Freshman Tim Fowler
looked good in the hurdles with a
second in the 60 highs and a third
in the 60 lows. Stu Nibley and
Sherwood teamed up for a first and
a fifth, respectively in the two-mile.
Captain Steve Darsie led freshman
Harrison Turnbull to a two-three
finish in the half. The excellent track
performances will be. equalled in
the field events. Coach Aldridge
feels, when all our field events can
come around outside,

The new season promises to be
an exciting one with a realistic slate
f opponents. Sherwood and Nibley
will be tough men to beat in the
long distances, as will Bill Kalal in
the three-mile. Johnny Newman,
Phifler Helms, and Dave Estes will
hold down the sprints. Darsie and
Keith Shaner, once he gets healthy
again, will run the half. Fowler will
icam up with Bill Wallace to pre-
sent quite a headache to opposition
rdiers, Other solid performances
are expected from Captain John
“the Sloth” Glace in just about any-

pointed by the President with the
advice of the E.C, also serve on the
committee. This group is concerned
with the development of general
policies while operational decisions
remain in the hands of the Librarian,
Although book selection is primar-
ily in the hands of the faculty, stu-
dents can recommend the purchase
of books through the use of the sug-
gestion box in the library.

In general W&L’s library system
compares favorably with schools of
a similar size. In terms of the num-
ber of volumes and __ periodicals,
WA&L has fewer than small northern
schools, but among similar southern
schools the library stands high. For
instance, compared to our 235,000
books and bound periodicals, Am-
herst has 449,321, Bucknell 374.,-
803, Vassar 416,338, Franklin and

Marshall 212,586, Dickinson 202,-
633, Davidson, 172,893, Hollins
122,225, and Randolph-Macon
120,139,

Washington and Lee does have
one big advantage over most of
these schools. That is the Honor

System. Because of a greater re-
spect for library material, W&L
students enjoy the easiest access to
the stacks of any library Mr. Leach
knows. However, if trends continue,
this tradition may slowly die. The
number of missing books and the
amount of mutilation has been in-
creasing. In the inventory conducted
in 1969 for the previous twenty year
period, 2200 books were missing.
In 1971 an inventory covering the
preceeding two years revealed 1300
books were missing. One result
of this trend has been _ the
locking of the stack doors in
the locking of the stack doors on
the ground floor at 5:00 each day. If
necessary Mr. Leach says they could
revert to the practice of allowing
only one entrance to the stacks at
all times, that being directly behind
the circulation desk. Ultimately if
the situation were to grow intoler-
able a guard could be employed to
check all books at the front door,
a practice which many libraries at
big universities are already using.
Hopefully student integrity will re-
main high enough so that such a
drastic measure will never be neces-
sary.

With the current plans for a new
library the physical deficiencies of
McCormick will soon be remedied
and the present budget appears to
be more in line with the goals of
the University. Although the library
system is not free of problems,
with the continued efforts by its staff
to extend its services and resources
McCormick Library is moving clos-
er to its goal of supporting and en-
couraging imellectual growth.

being stifled by the very institution
which is purporting to provide a lib-
eral education.

Occasionally, friends who are in-
terested in attending W&L and dis-
play creative talent and maturity,
ask for advice in selecting a college.
Until faculty and students here can
come together to develop a truly
liberal arts program, there is only
one reply I can give: look else-
where.

scrum and the ability of the offense
to keep Carolina pinned in their
own territory. Despite a comeback
effort by the Tar Heels which
brought the bulge down to six,
W&L won the day due to the fine
team play of both scrum and backs.
At Duke the game was really
over in the first ten minutes of play
as the Blue Devils put across 15
points before the Generals’ defense
could adjust. Duke, led by wrestling
coach Bill Harvey, known in area
rugby circles as the “Silver Fox,” is
undefeated in four games and has
yet to have a goal scored on them.
Creditable performances were
turned in by president Bill Ander-
son who filled in at fullback, Ron
Vaught, a substitute wing, and
scrummers Bob Deaderick, Al Mec-

Whorter and Leland Clemens.

The Ruggers will play a strong
American University in Washing-
ton on March 18 and return to
Sweet Briar College March 22 for
the season highlight with its tradi
tional rival U. Va. The game will
begin at 3:30 and entertainment will
