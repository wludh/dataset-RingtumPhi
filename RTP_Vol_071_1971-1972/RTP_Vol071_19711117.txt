1 W&L Op

Openings weekend kicks off this
Friday night with a University
combo party in the Cockpit, but
the highlight of the weekend will
be Gordon Lightfoot’s Saturday

night Doremus concert. Then, there
will always be those who won't

make it past the Saturday afternoon
grain party at the Pavillion.

After a series of highly successful
combos in the Cockpit featuring
varied types of music, the Student
Center has turned this week to the
Dill Brothers, an inventive blues
band, to put the weekend off to a
good start. The band will play from
8 to 11 p.m., but the beer, of course,
will flow until 11:30. Admission will
be $1.00 per person.

Phe ever popular University cock
tail party will be hitting Zollman’s
Buffalo Creek Pavillion on Saturday
afternoon. The refreshment served
will be called grain punch, but
there's no telling how long it will
last so it would be best to come
early. The party is scheduled for
4 until 6 p.m. with a group, Side
show, providing the music. Entrance
will be restricted to those carrying
their class identification cards.

After a quick dinner students can
then rush Doremus Gym-
nasium where Gordon Lightfoot will
be featured in concert by the Uni-
versity Dance Board. Unfortunately,
the 8 p.m. concert must be held in
the older basketball court, because
the entrances to the new gym have
yet to be completed, but the popular

Concert Impressions: Spring ’71....

Lightfoot Sings

By SKIP PAUKERT

It was a humid, drizzly night in
Washington, the rain making a mud
flat of the capital, where the Mora
torium people had camped the week
before—not a good night for a
concert. But inside massive Consti-
tution Hall they waited, 3,100 of the
faithful (myself included), milling
around their seats, glancing around
for familiar faces, wondering when
the lights would dim and the Big

Canadian would stroll out, their
Lightfoot
And when it was time the audi

ence settled and, with scattered clap
ping, the players emerged: first Red
Shea, lead guitar, with red hair,
grinning. then Rick Haynes, bass
guitar, tall, intent. Then the ap
plause broke loose, and quickly
Lightfoot was out, standing before
the audience, already beating out a
new tune, “The Summer Side of
Life.” on his 12-string Gibson

A broad-shouldered man with a
husky, room-filling voice, he stands
dressed in jeans, big boots, black
vest. He finishes three songs, all
new compositions, before he
a word to the crowd. Then, after
a quiet, carefree version of Kris-
tofferson’s “Me and Bobby McGee,”

Says

one of the two or three songs he
will sing this evening which he
didn't write himself, he eases into

some old Lightfoot favorites, and the
crowd knows them and applauds the
recognizable first chords:

“Softly as she comes

Whispers the breeze with het

passing

In secret love she is laughing

Softly as she comes in the
night.”

And we are quiet, attentive, as
Lightfoot picks gently at the melody
and caresses each word in fine voice,

honest lyrics, poetry. College stu
dents, teeny boppers, business men,
wives, just people, and beards and
jeans, and folk lovers, all listening
humming, catching every word. They
all feel the glow.

Soon, another one they know, an
early Lightfoot original which Peter,
Paul, and Mary made
few years ago, and they love it as
Lightfoot strums and sings:

“In the early morin’ rain

With a dollar in my hand
With an achin’ in my heart
And my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home
And I missed my loved one so,
In the early mornin’ rain.
With no place to go.”

.. Gordon Lightfoot was born
some 33 years ago and grew up in
a little town in the hills of Northern
Ontrio. He finished high school and
faced the inevitable choice of where
he'd go from there. He finally de
cided on a now-defunct music school

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

“Certain qualities distinguish Washington and Lee: Wash-
ington and Lee is small. With an enrollment of about 1500
in its divisions—the College; the School of Commerce, [co-
nomics and Politics; and the School of Law—the University
has remained small by choice. While there is no virtue in
smallness itself, experience has shown that it does encourage
close personal relationships between students and professors
and between students themselves. An atmosphere of friendli-
ness and respect prevails throughout the University. No stu-
dent is lost in the crowd or becomes a victim of ‘assembly-
line’ education.”

Washington and Lee University espouses the philosophy
of remaining a small institution of higher education, But, the
total enrollment is clearly swelling.

Several factors have spurred on this growth. The enroll-
ment of law students has increased sightly from 1965-1971.
The total number of students in the School of Law in 1965
was 194; this year the figure is 252. Yet the School of Law
trend is not too terribly pronounced. For the 1969-70 period
the School of Law enrollment fell to under 190 men, ‘Tucker
Hall is not the scene of the enrollment crime.

A higher percentage of men are graduating from W&L,
which has boosted our enrollment. Fewer men seem to flunk
out, join the service, or simply give up. In essence, more upper-
classmen stay in Lexington than in years past. This pheno-
menon of relatively content upperclassmen is compounded by
more and more transfer students especially from junior col-
leges and community colleges. And certainly, nobody can
forget the new students with skirts, who first attended last
fall. Coeducation has pushed that enrollment total a bit higher.

This year's freshmen class is one of the largest in W&L’s
history. Eight hundred forty-one men were chosen out of
1260 applicants, that is 66.74%. Three hundred fifty-two are
attending.

All these extra students mean several things to the Unt-
versity. Some people would be eager to point out that each
additional undergraduate means an extra $2,200 in Compre-
hensive Tuition Fees. That is a fact, and a good argument
for supplementing our University enrollment with more stu-
dents. But that appears to be the sole argument for increasing
enrollment.

\ larger student body eventually results in a larger demand
for University services: room, board, class space, teachers,
parking lots, and recreational facilities. W&L would welcome
the tuition fees but surely would not welcome the burden of
providing first-rate service to its resident population. The
University dormitories were not plush three years ago, perhaps
with the exception of the New Dorms. The Dutch Inn, Pres-
ton House, and Nelson House have been pressed into service
in recent semesters to hold the overflow of students needing
housing. Those three structures are even desirable
than the Old Dorms. They were either abandoned by private
concerns or were left vacant when fraternities folded,

less

Where will W&L house resident students next year, the
stadium? They have to live somewhere,

How big does W&L want to be? The only answer appears
to be BIGGER. Davidson College, with whom W&L often
is compared, has stabilized its student body at 1000 men.
If W&L is earnest in remaining small, then something must
be done to similarly reverse this growth trend, First, the
University can most easily regulate its size via the Admissions
Office. This may entail the concept of accepting fewer stu
dents, Second, W&L’s hierarchy should determine what the
optimum size for the University should be. Then a suggestion
would be that the University maintain that size and not just
adequately take care of the needs of its students, but rather
make W&L even more attractive by providing first-rate ser-
vices to all its student body,

Currently, the — Interfraternity
Council is studying the present rush
structure with an eye towards pos-
sible adjustments and recommenda-
tions for next year. This activity
has become an annual function of
the IFC’s standing Rush Commit-
tee. Although any proposals which
might be brought forward will not
be tendered for some weeks, a few
conclusions may be drawn from this
year’s rush,

At this writing. statistics indicate
that the 1971 rush was no _ less
successful than last year’s, when al-
most 65% of the freshman class
pledged a fraternity, While the per-
centage of rushees increased this
year (85%) over last year (75%),
roughly the same percentage pledg-
ed, Just over three quarters of the
rushees joined a fraternity. Mean-
while, some twenty-five freshmen
have indicated a desire to defer any
decision concerning fraternity mem-
bership. It would appear that 1971
will resemble 1970 very closely in
terms of Greek rush,

Nevertheless, certain observations
made during rush indicate that some
alterations may be necessary. As is
generally Known, this year’s rush
was reduced from seven weeks to
five since it was found that the
last two weeks of the 1970 rush
were superfluous; most decisions
were made in the first five weeks.
Whether this principle can be ap-
plied this year to the five week
plan remains to be seen. as the com-
mittee is in the process of analyz-
ing rush data on bid acceptances,
house by house. Although the length
of rush was a familiar complaint of
the freshmen, the committee does
not expect to find that a three week
rush would be more beneficial than
one of five weeks on the basis of
critical decision time.

Yet a major criticism of the five
week plan from the freshman point
of view was the dragging nature of
fraternity rush. In response to this,
the committee is considering the
elimination of a set number of open
houses and rush dates in favor of
a somewhat more flexible system of
interaction with the freshmen.

A second complaint common
among the rushees was the lack of
an organized effort to inform the
prospective rushees thoroughly about
rush procedures, This difficulty stems
from two sources. First, the IFC
has had great problems finding a
publisher who can meet a mailing
deadline for the Rush Book. In an
effort to better familiarize freshmen
with rush, the IFC plans to improve
the situation by employing a more
responsible publishing company than
those which have been used in the
past. An IFC committee has been
formed to find a suitable firm.

However, the IFC also intends to
request, on behalf of the incoming
freshmen, the opportunity to explain
procedural matters of rush before
an assembly of freshmen during next
year’s Orientation Week. The cur-
rent University policy, in its at-

 

tempt to be fair to all campus
organizations, is unfair to the fresh-
men themselves, in that they are
at a penalizing information disad-
advantage,

From an administrative point of
view, a more formal method of de-
termining final fraternity pledging
is needed, This year, freshmen re-
sponse to the use of preferential
cards was poor; perhaps this was
due in part to a lack of information
concerning this final procedure,

Already, an ugly consequence of
rush has been resolved. In light of
this year’s Quad riot on the last night
of rush, the IFC passed legislation
which makes the Freshman Quad
area off limits to upperclass fratern-
ity men from eleven o'clock on.
Stiff fines and social probation could
result from the violation of this
rule.

Thus, while the five week plan
served the basic needs for a success-

From Various Perspectives
From The I. F. C. President...

From A Rush

By J. HUDSON ALLENDER

Upon returning to Lexington this
past fall, upperclassmen were met
with a somewhat dismaying situa-
tion, The expected rush on the new
gym never materialized and it is
yet a long way from completion. In
addition there was no hurry in
putting the final touches on the new
parking lot. However, where the
University wasn’t really rushing, fra-
ternities on campus were hurriedly
preparing to do so.

Each September at W&L students
return in anticipation of beer at
Goshen, BS sessions of summer ex-
periences, and road trips to Hollins.
By the same token, most fraternity
upperclassmen also arrive on campus
with a dread of a rush chairman’s
orders and a resignment to the
tedium of six unending weeks of
rush. As if the week and a half
preceeding the beginning of classes
isn’t bad enough, filled with scrub-
bing, printing, endless meetings and

From A Freshman...

By PRESTON SIMPSON

As a freshman going through
Rush for the first time, I found
it one of the most interesting ex-
periences of my life. Never before
have I met so many people in so
short a time; but there was more
to it than that. Rush gave me a
valuable lesson not only in the art
of conversing with strangers, but, at
the same time, in evaluating these
strangers and myself.

One of the most difficult aspects
of Rush for me was the simple
problem of finding a conversation
topic of mutual interest to me and
the fraternity members with whom
| was speaking. Yet once that
obstacle had been met successfully,
another presented itself. I had to
decide whether | was compatible
with this group, and IT had to decide
whether | shared with them some
common interests and philosophies.

And at the same time I knew I
was being scrutinized very closely
by the members. Not only did |
have to worry about evaluating
others, | also had to examine my
own strengths and weaknesses, won-
dering how much of each to show.
| suppose the general rule for a
rushee is to be himself, but that
maxim is not so easy to follow
as it is to state. | knew it was
important to let the fraternity
know something about me, but T was
nearly as afraid of making known
my streng points for fear of seem-
ing boastful as | was afraid of
revealing my weaknesses. In fact, I
was often prompted to stop and
examine myself in order to decide
what actually were my strengths and
weaknesses and to consider how they
might be suited to a fraternity.

The structure of Rush leaves little
to be criticized; in general it was
well organized and efficiently run.
| do think it was extended over

too long a time. I would like to see
the same number of Rush dates in

the future, but they should be com-
pressed into a shorter period of
time. However, I do not think |
would like Rush to be only one week
long like it was previous to. last
year. | am glad it lasted a few
weeks so that I had time to think
about certain problems for several
days before having to make decis-
ions. It also gave me a chance to
discuss problems with other people,
both freshmen and upperclassmen,
who helped me resolve doubts and
make up my mind. However, the
process did begin to become mo-
notonous at the end, and for this
reason | think it should be shorten-
ed slightly. I also think Sunday after-

Chairman...

clinics, the only relief is yet six
weeks following. Until then, beer,
potato chips, BS, and more meet-
ings are one’s only comfort.

The actual rush situation itself can
almost be valuable and fun—but
only almost! The initial open houses
and rush dates are informative and
exciting. New faces and ideas are a
novelty to the established regimen
of a fraternity. The conversations are
still fresh and the enthusiasm
genuine, But that soon changes, It
gets to be a drag for all con-
cerned as the dates get longer and
pledge classes form. The only
sources of any kind of pleasure are
those few instances with each date
when a guy pledges or “tears.”
Weekend plans revolve about enter-
taining prime. rushees and keeping
them happy with dates, Freshmen
also soon tire of this routine, For the
last few rush dates there were more
freshmen at Hollins, Baldwin. and
Macon than there were at the fra-
ternities. Who can blame them?

This was, thank God, my last
rush and it went well for our house,
Yet in the face of this success, |
still wouldn't wish the same ex-
perience even on my future father-
in-law, The structure of rush was
hard on the freshmen and even
worse on upperclassmen, After two
weeks or so all was pretty much
anticlimatic. For the most part,
minds have been made up by the
third week and it makes sense that
it should end then, For that small
percentage of rushees who aren't
sure by then there is always de-
ferred rush,

Rush is no longer a rush. True,
there is a better opportunity for dis-
crete selection but I wonder how
many times this opportunity is
utilized. I contend that the-name of
rush should be changed—let’s call
it Drag.

From A Faculty Member . . ,

By DR. THOMAS C, IMESON I

Any opinions or evaluations | may
have of the present fraternity rush
program are derived from a vant-
age point considerably removed
from the focus. As a faculty mem-
ber, my interest in the program only
extends to the point that it touches
the academic endeavors and the gen-
eral tenor of the institution. For the
most part, the actual mechanics and
resultant effects of rush are, I think,
the sole province of the Interfratern-
ity Council and its respective fra-
ternity membership. However, this
does not mean that there exists a
dichotomy between fraternities and
the university vis a vis a rush pro-
gram, for such a program should
work for their mutual benefit with
neither having cause to feel or ex-
perience penalty.

In my opinion the present rush
program is adequate. The extension
of the rush schedule over a period
of five weeks permits the freshman
to place possible fraternity member-
ship within a perspective relative to
his other campus activities. He is not

“Honor System In The Dining Hall"?

subjected to an intensive one week
rush (as previously was the case) and
thereby is not caused to assume the
first legitimate collegiate enterprise
to be fraternities. Therefore, the
rush schedule would seem to be the
Most important aspect of the present
system.

The liberalization, this year, of
the “contact rule” creates a more
realistic climate for relationships be-
tween freshmen and upperclass fra-
ternity members, Fraternities are to
be commended for putting aside
their mutual suspicion and distrust
in the adoption of this attitude.

No doubt, when compared to the
Previous rush schedule, the present
one requires additional expenses and
energies on the point of fraternities.
However if fraternities are to sur-
vive, their membership can not be
drawn from individuals initially act-
ing on @ capricious or hasty decision,
The present rush program would
seem to enable a more rational and
objective judgment on a freshman’s
part.

Draft Deferments
Can Be Dropped

Before December 31

Young men who wish to drop
draft deferments in favor of 1-A
classifications may still do so. Local
boards will continue to grant these
requests even though the young men
continue to meet the conditions for
which the deferments were granted,
Six categories are included: 1-S, high
school students; 2-A, occupational
deferments or vocational/technical
students; 2-C, agricultural defer-
ments; 2-D, divinity students; 2-5,
undergraduate college students; and
3-A, hardship deferments.

This policy was instituted in late
1970 and was of particular interest
fo young men with random sequence
(lottery) numbers above the highest
RSN called for induction, By drop-
ping their deferments at the end of
the year, they became part of that
year's prime selection group, On
January 1, they were placed in a
second priority position. Because of
this, they are not subject to induc-
tion until the manpower supply in
the first priority selection group is
exhausted: a development likely only
if a major national emergency
mecurs

The policy was reaffirmed in a
Local Board Memorandum sent fast
week by Draft Director Curtis W.
Tarr to all 4,000 local draft boards.
Registrants who desire to take ad
vantage of the policy in 1971 must
have been born in 1951 or earlier.

Recently when Vice-President
Agnew was visiting some African
nations he made a statement some-
where along the line that “the Black
leaders in America could learn a
lot from the Black leaders in
Africa.” Maybe Mr. Agnew didn't
know that the civil rights motives
in America and Africa are on dif-
ferent platforms.

I now take the pleasure to school
our great, wise and honorable Vice-
President about the differences of
Black-Power in America and Africa.
(Brutus was an honorable man when
he stabbed Caesar).

First, Mr. Agnew and his sup-
porters must be told that in most
African nations the Blacks comprise
most of the population. In Nigeria
99 per cent, etc, The objectives of
the political movements in these
countries are therefore to capture
the legislative, executive and judicial
branches on a national level. In the
United States Blacks only comprise
around 12 per cent of the popula-
tion and do not claim to or expect
to capture the Supreme Court, Con-
gress and the Presidency for “our-
selves.” Since the objectives are dif-
ferent, so must the strategy also be
different. If the colonial situations
in Africa are to be compared with
the political situations in America
on the same basis then people will
be misled.

We must note that struggle for
Blacks in America is unique. The
appropriate strategies are formed by
the trial and error method because
of this uniqueness, The Black ex-
perience in America is a great trial
therefore a great deal of error is
inevitable. We as Blacks must learn
to make good use of these errors
though. No individual, group,
organization, state or nation is in-
fallible.

The goals and tactics of Black
power in America must be aligned
with the American reality. In re-
spect to integration and equal rights,
the struggle has been in the form
of the Black-Power movement. The
best means for the Blacks to achieve
their share of the fruits is by first
going through a stage of temporary
self-segregation. This is what we as
Blacks mean by “Separation.”

Most of the minorities of America
have passed through a stage of
temporary segregation. America
really is a country where different
people of different races work side
by side without integration, We must
discard the myth of America being
a “melting pot.” Intergration is ac-
complished only between seven
o'clock in the morning and four
o'clock in the evening. This is the
time of the day when both Blacks
and Whites go to work together in
the banks, schools, stores and fac-
tories. After four in the evening
every group returns to its neighbor-
hood. That neighborhood usually has
its own stores, schools and doctors.
Although the Italians and Poles are
both white Catholics they don't dare
to marry each other.

This self-segregation is used by
those who do not want to lose
themselves (cultural identity) in the
American pool. This type of segrega-
tion is a norm of today mainly
because most Americans believe in
cultural pluralism.

Therefore, the Black-Power move-
ment goes along with the American
tradition when we say that there
are certain areas and communities
that are Black neighborhoods where
the Black doctor, preacher, grocer,
teacher, and politician should be
able to fulfill roles which are not
open to them—de facto-—in other
communities,

What Black-Power is saying now
is that both the North and South
should recognize that the official and
middie class jobs in these Black
neighborhoods belong to Blacks who
are not permitted to hold jobs of
this caliber in Gentile, Polish, Italian
or other ethnic communities, What
we as Blacks are saying is “give
us control over our own institutions”

community and neighborhood
power, Maybe this is why the Blacks
in the South are a “little better off”
than the Blacks in the North. The
Blacks in the South have a little
more control over their community

 

“Black Focus”

because of the overt stand of | the
segregationist.

The American economic life is
dominated by a few large corpora-
tions which do the bulk of the busi-
ness. Half of the country’s assets
in manufacturing are owned by
about 100 corporations. We may
find a Black store in the Black
neighborhood but never will we find
a Black General Motors, Penn-Cen-
tral, Standard-Oil Co. or Union
Carbide. We only make up about
12 per cent of the population, In
the African states there should be
a Black General Motors, Penn-Cen-
tral, Standard Oil Co., etc. because
the Blacks there have a vast ma-
jority.

The problem in America is similar
to the economic problem in Africa
but on a smaller scale. Whereas we
comprise about 12 per cent of the
population, we have only 2 per cent
of the jobs at the top, 4 per cent

Letters To The Editor

Robinson Answers Editor

To the Editor:

In your November 10 issue, Edi-
tor-in-Chief Robinson continued his
series of attacks upon the University
Council, He described this group as
“characterized by absenteeism, lack
of discussion, shortage of planning,
loss of direction, and benign ac-
ceptance of University policy.” This
statement is just another example of
the misinformation published by
the Ring-tum-Phi concerning the
University Council.

As for absent members, particu-
larly faculty members to whom Mr.
Robinson refers, there were, to my
knowledge, two faculty members
absent at the October meeting. Both
of them came to me, since I was
Chairman for that meeting, and pre-
sented very valid excuses. Their two
legitimate absences brought the total
of faculty absences to a total of
three for five U. C. meetings.

Concerning the “lack of discus-
sion,” all the sessions of the council,
with the exception of the last one,
have extended past the prescribed
time for termination of debate. This
does not seem to be a “lack of
discussion” to me.

The editorial also mentioned a
“shortage of planning” and a lack
of agenda, For the information of
the Ring-tum Phi, which seems to
have a lack of investigative report-
ing, agendas are handed out to all
interested parties at the start of
each meeting. It is the responsi-
bility of the individual placing a
topic on the agenda to prepare in-
formation for the discussion, and
in most cases, this planning has
been done.

The editorial also refers to the
closed part of the meeting. At this
part of the meeting, minutes of fac-
ulty committee meetings, are dis-
cussed. These minutes include act-
ions of the Committee on Courses
and Degrees and the Faculty Execu-
tive Committee concerning petitions
of individual students. These pro-
ceedings are confidential, and the
students on the U.C. are well aware
of this. There is no reason for the
Ring-tum Phi to be informed of
these actions; it would not benefit
anyone, and could lead to embarass-
ment later.

As for Mr. Allender’s article, |
believe there are also grounds for
dispute, In addition to the false,
grossly misleading headline, Mr,
Allender has his facts a little con-
fused, During the discussions of
parietals in SAC with the dorm
counselors, these men, primarily the
author of the article in question,
assured SAC that the freshman were
very concerned with the ideal of
self-government as well as having
women in their rooms, While talk-
ing to the freshman class officers
in the SAC meeting two weeks later,
self-government was not mentioned
by the freshmen as a reason for the
change in social hours. In fact, these
men denied, when asked, that self-
government Was even a considera
tion of the freshmen. The freshmen
just wanted to have women in their
rooms,

The editorial, as well as the article
on parietals, are marked by poor
factual reporting. Mr, Robinson
states that there was no discussion
on the grade F matter at the U«
If he had attended the September
meeting of the U.C. he would have

been able to listen to a lengthy
debate on the issue. Mr, Allender
states that the SAC vote was 6-4-1.
Only ten members of SAC can vote;
where did the extra vote come
from? The editorial states that “the
student newspaper is a responsible
forum,” and questions whether the
U.C., is one. In my opinion, as well
of that of most other people, the
primary responsibility of a news-
paper is accurate reporting. If the
shoe fits, wear it.

Government Problems

To the Editor:

This university is presently faced
with a series of problems which, if
not solved, may lead to complete
chaos in and disenchantment with
the governing councils of the student
body. In reaction to the difficulties
presented them, the many and varied
governing committees and councils
run around frightened and confused.
Why?

The student government is afraid
to come to grips with any of the
problems. They seem to want to
ignore them and hope that they will
somehow disappear. Different coun-
cils are paranoid about public ex-
posure of the agendas and pro-
cedures of their meetings. There is
no cause for such fright. The gov-
erning councils here are public
forums, not secretive power cliques,

An attempt to hush an issue up
is worse than trying to solve it
openly. If this continues, a public
mistrust of government proceedings
and decisions may result. These com-
mittees and councils are also too
remote from the individual student.
Due to the variety of committees, a
student does not know where to turn
to seek answers or reforms. He has
no clear picture about what is going
on and who is making decisions for
him. The individual student tends to
feel helpless because of this,

Another factor involved in the in-
creasing inefficiency of the govern-
ment is the multiplicity of commit-
tees and councils, On the issue of
parietals alone, two separate com-

mittees would have had legal justi-
fication in handing down a final de-
cision. What would have happened
if both had, and the decisions con-
flicted? Where would the students
turn for the answer? Four separate
committees may call a student in to
answer for his discipline and actions.
The powers and jurisdictions of these
different committees and councils be-
gin to dangerously overlap.

The Honor System, a long cherish-
ed bulwark of the university, is
dying due to the inability of the
governing bodies to cope with the
situation, It is not all the structure's
faults, but the government structure
can not be held blameless. Whoever
dreamt up this system ought to be
ashamed of himself. The system has
conflicting committee jurisdictions,
and a veritable jungle of governing
councils, It seems as if a commit-
tee is created to deal with every
problem that arises.

Last year, as I understand it, an
effort was made to restructure the
government. The effort failed due to
a poor voter turn out, which indi-
cates student apathy. But student
apathy results from a_ frustration
with the government, and an in-
ability to communicate with it. This
is the governing system's fault, not
the students’ fault.

Another cause for the student
apathy could be an ignorance of the
faults in the system. The student
body will not become overly con-
cerned until they are harmed in
some manner by the processes of the
system. By then it will be too late.

A better system would be one
where the power of government is
concentrated into one legislative
body. its officers, and its standing
committees (composed of members
of the legislature). A proportional re-
presentation should be employed,
and the constituencies should be

THE RING-TUM PHI

Page 3

 

By MARC SMALL

It is a curious thing that both
Left and Right can claim that they
alone represent the forces of per-
sonal freedom: while much of this
ambiguity results from mere politi-
cal rhetoric, still a great part of it
comes from conflicting and confus-
ing definitions. The Left of Hubert
Humphrey, for instance, supports the

 

vast corpus of civil rights legisla-
tion which has done much to in-
fringe on the liberties of all in
return for only tokenism, while the
Left of Eugene McCarthy ostensibly
stands opposed to the thoughtless
expansion of federal laws; in the
same way, the Right of Phillip Ab-
bot Luce has repeatedly spoken out
against the draft in opposition to
the Right of Strom Thurmund, In
spite of these seemingly contradic-
tory positions, certain truths can still
be drawn from these often mean-
ingless labels.

It is the conservative who is
loathe to utilize the legislatures as
problem-solving bodies, preferring
instead the “private sector.” It is

ein /\ Sayglass Darkly...
Definitions

   

the conservative who sees each addi-
tional law as another burden on the
individuality of every citizen. It is
the conservative, in short, who feels
that it will ever be impossible to
settle every dispute and problem
that arises, and accordingly thinks
that moderate solutions not disrup-
tive of personal liberty are prefer-
able to drastic legislation which,
more often than not, restricts initia-
tive needlessly while providing tem-
porary and slipshod answers to
eternal conflicts,

The liberal, on the other hand,
sees the central government as a
buffer for the individual against
vague and phantasmagorical oppon-
ents. Whenever a problem arises, the
liberal is often inclined to disavow
any private solution whatsoever, and
seeks heavy-handed solace from the
government: this, obviously, tends to
be a chain reaction that, seemingly
innocuous in the beginning, soon re-

sults in a serious surrender of
rights each time federal help is
sought.

The federal government is a con-
glomeration of humans, each one
susceptible to human frailties and
as imperfect as you and I, It is
as corrupt, as power-mad, as liable
to error as any large corporation,
any labor union, or any other large
and ponderous body. Power, once
yielded to any central authority, is
frequently abused and rarely sur-
rendered: how soon will it be that
we see the end of Nixon's sup-
posedly temporary Phase Two eco-
nomic plans? All too often, it is
the crux of wisdom to restrict
political action to sources outside

not be a member of the extended
priority selection group. Moreover,
they must submit their request in
writing. To be considered as part of
the 1971 prime selection group, the
requests must be postmarked no
later than December 31.

RSN 125 has been set as the year-
end ceiling for 1971 draft calls. Un-
like 1970, when the year-end ceil-
ing was not necessarily reached by
all local boards, the authorization in
the 1971 draft amendments of a
Uniform National Call insures that
all eligible registrants will be con-
sidered for induction if they: (1) are
in Class 1-A on December 31, (2)
are 20 years of age or older on
that date, and (3) have RSNs of 125
or below. If young men meet these
criteria, but are not inducted dur-
ing 1971, their liability for induc-
tion will be extended into 1972.
They will be prime candidates for
induction during the first three
months of the year along with other
men who are now in the extended
priority selection group.

ping of deferments, Dr. Tarr said:
“Young men holding lottery num-
bers of RSN 126 and above can
effectively limit their vulnerability
to the draft by being classified into
1-A by the year’s end. Since the law
allows young men to apply for de-
ferments, we believe those young
men granted deferments should be
able to drop them if they desire.”

“Our purposes” Tarr added, “are
to achieve fairness to all registrants
in determining their priority status
on January | of the mew year and
to limit the uncertainty that young
men with high random sequence
numbers face. Registrants with stu-
dent, occupational, paternity, agri-
cultural, and hardship deferments
will be eligible to take advantage of
this policy.”

The Memorandum also amends
Selective Service policy on allowing
record changes in birthdates upon
submission of adequate evidence.
Starting Dec. 10, if a birthdate
change is submitted after the regis-
trant has received a lottery number,
the records will be changed, but the
registrant will retain his original lot-
tery number.

Former Athletic Director Richard A, Smith and, Supreme Court Nominee Lewis Powell reminisce about old times.

“Cap'n Dick” Remembers
Lewis Franklin Powell, Jr.

Portions of a column by
Chauncey Durden, Richmond
Times-Disptach sports editor, that
appear below are reprinted from
that newspaper.

AMONG THE TELEGRAMS
Lewis F,. Powell Jr. received after
being nominated to the U.S. Su-
preme Court by President Nixon was
the following:

THRILLED FOR YOU, W&L
AND THE COUNTRY. LEIGH
WILLIAMS WOULD APPROVE.

The telegram was signed “Cap'n
Dick.”

“Cap'n Dick” is, of course, Rich-
ard A, Smith, who retired as Wash-
ington and Lee's Director of
Athletics in 1954 after 33 years in
that position. And Cap'n Dick, who
is still going strong in Lexington,
had a story about his telegram to
the distinguished Richmond lawyer
who had to have been, as an under-
graduate at W&L, the youngest re-
cruiter ever “put on the road” by
an athletic director or coach.

“Lewis Powell,” Cap'n Dick re-
called, “was the manager of the foot-
ball team his senior year (1928-29)
at W&L. He was a brilliant young
man with a persuasive tongue and a
marked dedication to whatever was
the job at hand.

“When football practice first began
his senior year, I called him to my
office and said, ‘Lewis, I've got a

Norfolk 10-0 and downed American
University 15-6,

The Blue squad had to endure
back to back games on Saturday
and Sunday. Pacing up to the always
powerful Norfolk Rugby Club on
Saturday, the Blue fought through a
scoreless first half. The big Norfolk
ruggers simply were not able to
break the strong, alert W&L defense
But Norfolk matched the WAL de-
fense, paralyzing the Blue's offensive

Entering the second half, both
teams were hungry for scores. A

“He said, ‘But I'm the manager
of the team. I'm needed here.’

“Il told him, ‘There is a boy in
Norfolk who is the greatest athlete
in the State. His name is Leigh
Williams and he’s going to VPI
unless we convince him otherwise.
We need him badly here at W&L.
I want you to go to Norfolk and
bring him back with you.”

“I'll do whatever you want me
to do,” he said.

“1 said, ‘Good. Get in that Ford

there until you can bring Williams
back, trunk and all.”

“I don’t remember how many days
Lewis was in Norfolk,” Cap'n Dick
continued, “three or four, but
Leigh’s parents fell in love with him.
They agreed W&L was the school
for Leigh—with one proviso. “We'll
let him go with you,’ Mrs, Williams
told Lewis, ‘if he can room with
you.”

“That posed a problem for Lewis

out by getting Leigh pledged to the

words, “was the greatest all-round
athlete in W&L’'s history.”

Williams was a fine end in foot-
ball, a good baseball player and
track man, but basketball was his
strongest sport. He stood three or
four inches over six feet, which
height made him a “tall ‘un” for
those years. Cap'n Dick was WA&L’s
basketball coach back then. He says
Williams was the best player in the
South.

“Leigh was almost a one-man
team,” Cap'n Dick said yesterday
“We had no subs, that is subs who
could play basketball, We made a

sophomore season and on successive

nights, defeated North Cuarolina

the small college classic, the Knute

one game all year, and that game by
one point. Washington and Lee has
shocked quite a few teams over the

LaRue’s Pressbox
Picking the Bowl Games

By ROB “LASH” LaRUE

It would be absolutely insane for
me to try to forecast any bowl
games at this point, since so much
has yet to be decided. But insanity
seems to be this columnist only
virtue, and I will therefore attempt
to untangle the 1971 football snarl.
One thing is practically certain -
this year’s bowl games, for a change,
will feature some strong teams.
None of this 6-5 stuff which we
had to suffer through last year,

The two weakest games will be
the Rose Bowl and the Cotton Bowl.
In each of those games, at least
one team has been beaten twice.
In the Rose, Stanford will take on
Michigan. In Dallas, a sub-average
Texas squad will probably host
Georgia.

The Orange Bowl and the Sugar
Classic are looking to be the big
ones this year. The Orange will in
all likelihood feature a pair of un-
beatens and will probably be the
conclusive battle for setthement of
the No. | position. The winner of
the Big Eight Conference, either
Oklahoma or Nebraska, will meet
the winner of the Alabama-Auburn
contest, for the Orange game, while
the two losers will travel to New
Orleans for the Sugar Bowl.

Think that sounds right? | don't
either, and here’s why. Penn State
has to go somewhere, especially if
it stay unbeaten. Now if Tennessee
can bump off the Nittany Lions,
then the problem is solved, as the
Pennsylvanians would likely end up
Gator Bowl bound. If Penn State re-
mains undefeated, they could re-
place Alabama or Auburn in either
the Sugar or the Orange, sending
these teams elsewhere, Penn State
could conceivably look westward to
the Cotton, but the Dallas im-
presarios would be loathe to give
the Nittanies a shot at a weak Texas
team.

The bowl picture becomes a little
more clear (?) when looked at in
these terms:

Rose Bowl—Stanford v. Michigan

Cotton Bowl—Texas v. Georgia

Orange Bowl—winner, Oklahoma-
Nebraska v. winner, Auburn-Ala-
bama

Sugar Bowl—loser, Oklahoma-Ne-
braska or loser, Auburn-Alabama v.

Ruggers Win One, Lose One

(Continued from page 5)
characterized by mass confusion,
with the ball popping in and out of
players’ hands and then bouncing
into the end zone, Norfolk scored,
as both a W&L rugger and a Nor-
folk one simultaneously downed the
ball. The extra point was good, and
the Blue trailed 6-0. The Blue were
out to get the score back, and suc-
ceeded in two breakaway runs, only
to have the man stopped near the
opposing goal and the ball rapidly
returned downfield by the well
organized Norfolk club. It was just
such a play that set up the final
Norfolk try. But the kick-after-try
failed. For the remainder of the
game the Blue tried valiantly to
score but were always stopped by
the big Norfolk defense. The Blue
defense held Norfolk far from the
goal and when the final whistle blew,
Norfolk had a victory, 10-0, keep-
ing their record blemished by only
one loss this year.

Sunday, saw the Blue again suited
up for action to face American Uni-
versity. The Blue came out on the
field looking good right away. The
Blue defense crippled the American
University offense. Even more im-
portant the Blue moved the ball
forward, and the action for the
entire first half took place on the
A.U. side of the field. The Blue
brought the ball in hear the goal
line twice before Mike Truda, with
the weight of the entire scrum be-
hind him, finally scored. Fred
Fletcher kicked the extra point, and
the Blue led 6-0. Action was much
the same soon after and it was not
long before goal line action de-
veloped again. Bill Martin took it
in for the try. Fred Fletcher again
made the kick-after-try good and
the Blue had a solid 12-0 lead.

But then, with the first half nearly
over, the W&L club got the wrong
end of a bad break. A kicked ball
hit an American University rugger
and bounced high over the head of
the W&L defenders who were farth-
est back. An A.U. rugger already
sprinting upfield grabbed the ball

tions, and an innate sense of pinball
strategy.” Hindsley went on to point
out that, while a novice’s game
might be finished in a few seconds,
a player blessed with the tools can

make a dime last an entire after-
noon,
Hindsley has complemented his

keen insight into the sport’s mores
with the operation of five machines
in Lexington. Of these, his favorite
is “Paul Bunyan,” which is situated
in the basement of the PIKA house.
“This machine has six flippers,”
Hindsley points out, “exemplifying
the technological achievement that
put man on the moon.” With a bow
to sentiment, Hindsley went on to
point out that the machine also fea-
tures chimes similar to those heard
in churches.

Kelly Buell, also a senior, stressed
the amusement aspect of the activity
while firing shot after shot at a
confusing array of changing patterns,
permutations and “features” in a
downtown Lexington machine. He
has watched individuals battle ma-
chines for as long as four hours
at a stretch.

young pinball superstar consented to
ask himself the question, “Why do
I go back?”

Shaner cited the challenges of
pinball as the sport's fundamental
drawing card. “It's all the same,”
he points out, “there are no alibis,
the machine can destroy anybody.”

Gamesmanship is a special forte
of Shaner, who calls “Aces and
Kings” at the Quid his home ma-
chine. “I like to go first,” he says,
and then watch my opponent try
to catch up.”

Like Hindsley, Shaner views pin-
ball as a true test of atheltic capa-
bilities, a contest calling for timing.
fingertip dexterity, mental toughness,
and body control,

Students are not the only indivi-
duals touched by pinball influence.
Mr. James Toler of the University
Co-op, admits he had misgiving
when he introduced pinball about
two years ago. “I was hesistant at
first, and could use the space for
something else. But the students
seem to enjoy it to quite an extent,
and as long as they seem to enjoy
it, Tm for it. fm not against some
revenve on it either.”

When operative, (at this writing
the Co-op pinball assembly is tem-
porarily incapacitated) the conces-
sion nets between $40 and $50 a
week .which is divided between the
Co-op and the company that pro-
vides the machines. Mr. Toler has
noticed that the same people seem
to frequent his machine and he at-
tempts to change the unit occasion-
ally to insure variety.

Ernie Lawhorne of The Para-
mount Inn believes his four machine
compiex is a financial succes. An
accomplished pinballer himself.
Ernie finds it a “great game,” but
one whose intricate skills can be
accomplished only through rigorous
practice

Hence pinball appears to be a
true bond between generations in
this troubled era. It seems to pro
true enjoyment. as well as
aiding an individual to develop
qualities crucial in laier life: self-
discipline, patience. devotion to
something greater than oneself

Yet pinball. like any other pres
sure packed athletic endeavor, pos
its detractors. One student
admitied pinball was “a tremendous
fad. everywhere,” and could be play
ed for “pride and amusement.” At
the time. however, he
forced to admit that his own career
was at an end. Looking on wistfully
as a friend rolled a high, satisfying
the ex-ballplayer acknowledg
ed. “I used to play a lot, but it's
addictive.”

noon Rush dates should be eliminat-

that they were inconvenient for
freshmen and fraternity members
alike.

I came to college woefully inept
and inexperienced in the art of
meeting and evaluating others, and
although Rush has hardly made me
an expert at it, the process did
give me much-needed practice in
skills I will have to employ for
the rest of my life. For these rea-

Lightfoot Highlights
Openings Weekend

100,000 copies in Canada alone. His
songs have been recorded by the
likes of Bob Dylan, Judy Collins,
Glen Campbell, Barbra Streisand,
Johnny Cash, and Richie Havens.

And now, more than two hours
have passed (swiftly), after an encore
of his Top Ten single, “If You
Could Read My Mind,” the end of
his concert approaches.

The Great Song is coming. the one
he wrote for the Canadian Centen-
nial Celebration, an exciting, tradi-
tional ballad written in an age when
genuine folk songs are rare....
Lightfoot begins his “Canadian Rail-
road Trilogy”

“There was a time in this fair land

when the railroad did not run,/

When the wild majestic moun-

tains stood alone against the
sun./

Long before the White Man, and

long before the wheel./

When the green dark forest was

too silent to be real.”

The spotlight shines on the man,
his forehead sparkling with beads
of sweat, his big hands beating out
the locomotive rhythms, Red Shea's
fingers flying fast over his guitar,
the sound—flowing, full, rolling out
to us... And everyone leaning for-
ward attentive,

“We are the Navvies who work

upon the railroad, /

Swinging our hammers in the

bright blazin’ sun./

Livin’ on stew and drinking bad

whiskey, /

Bending our backs till the

railroad is done.”
With the last stanzas, the song ends,
and the applause breaks out, loud
and grateful. Lightfoot smiles, nods,
says thanks. I'm on my feet, then
he’s gone...

I still cherish that concert. |
think about the songs, the energy,
the electricity of a performer really
committed to sharing his life with
audience. Lyrics that reach out to

Outlook Good

For Admissions

By ANDREW SIMPSON

At a time when many of the 352
freshmen of the Class of 1975 are
still settling down to college life,
news comes from the Director of
Admissions, James Farrar, that 55
early decision candidates have al-
ready been accepted for the Class
of 1976,

The 55 were chosen from a field
of 70 early decision applicants and
represent the highest number of
early decision candidates ever ac-
cepted by Washington and Lee. In
1967, 47 such candidates were ac-
cepted, the greatest number before
the Class of 1976 figures. Judging
from past experience, Dean Farrar
expects “all of the 55” to enroll at
Washington and Lee next September,

As far as regular admissions for
the Class of 1976 is concerned,
Dean Farrar notes that, “the figures
are still a little bit ahead of last
year’s.” As of November 11, 272
applications for regular admissions
had been received, which is an in-
crease of 15 applicants over last
year’s figures for the same date. Al-
though Dean Farrar cautions against
overemphasizing the significance of
this increase at such an early date,
he is optimistic that the trend. the
“good news,” will continue.
