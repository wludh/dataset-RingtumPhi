One Vote Kills

The University Council, in its first
monthly meeting of the year Thurs-
day night, defeated a move to
abolish parietal regulations by a one-
vote margin. As a result, dormitory
sections in both the freshman and
upperclass dorms will proceed this
week to draw up visitation hours
within the established guidelines for
approval by the Student Control
Commitee.

The Council, a joint body of both
students and faculty, was chaired by
Student Body President Steve Robin-
son and University President R. E.
R. Huntley. First conceived last
year, the University Council serves
as a sounding board for recom-
mendations to the administration
and the student EC, and also serves
as the highest authority over student
affairs,

In other business Thursday, the
group approved the curriculum and
reviewed the actions of various fac-
ulty committees made since the last
session, discussed Professor Edward
Pinney’s proposal to abolish the
grade F, and discussed the feasibility
of merging the faculty and student
committees on Curriculum, Library,
and Admissions affairs.

The debate over parietals began
when Dr, Thomas Imeson, a repre-
sentative of both the Student Affairs
Committee (SAC) and the University
Council, outlined the changes ap-
proved by SAC in the area of
women’s visitation in university
housing. He pointed out that hours
were to be drawn up by each sec-
tion, having been defined with their
individual counselors, and that the
outside guidelines for weekend hours
had been extended to from 5 p.m.
Friday to Sunday midnight. Imeson
also announced that the Student
Affairs Committee had relinquished
the power of immediate review of
section parietal regulations to the
Student Control Committee, a body
entirely composed of students, as
opposed to the joint faculty and stu-
dent make-up of SAC.

Then sophomore Lewis Powell
asked, “Is it necessary to have a
rule if it won't be followed?” [meson
replied that there was an apprecia-
tion that violations did occur under
the parietal system last year, but
that it was up to the dormitory
counselors to see that it was up-
held. Powell countered that viola-
tions went on “with the knowledge
of the dorm counselors” and that it
was difficult for the university to
“legislate morality” among the stu-
dents,

Muskie

By RAY SWAN

Mr. and Mrs, Robert Squier,
media planning consultants for
Maine Senator Edmund Muskie,

spoke to a group of students in
Reid Hall last Monday afternoon.

Sponsored by the Washington and
Lee Mock Convention and the
Journalism Department, the Squiers
explained the process of projecting
a candidate's personality and plat-
form over the electronic media,
especially television.

“Our job,” said Mr, Squier, “is to
design a very effective and efficient
communication system.” According
to a Gallup poll, less than 9 per
cent of the electorate had personal
contact with any candidate at any
level. In spite of this, television has
“brought politics into the living
room,” said Mr, Squier.

Studen

There are signs that the state-wide

contreversy concerning college stu

dents registering in their campus
towns may affect the situation in
Lexington. In one instance, Bill
McLeod, a WAL junior and presi
dent of the University Republican
Club, has contacted the American
Civil Liberties Union and has

threatened to file suit “if need be to
protect my right to vote.”

McLeod attempted to register at
City Hall on Monday, and Mrs, Eva
Moore, City Registrar, who handles
this for Lexington
weording to McLeod, that she was

The factor of privacy was entered
into the discussion when Imeson
said he would expect hours to be
delineated within the guidelines to
insure “some time” within the week-
end for the privacy of others in the
dorm section. It was also pointed
out that peer pressure within the
sections would lead to each student
approving the most liberal hours,
“whether he really wanted these
hours or not.” Dean Lewis John
suggested one reason for the parietal
guidelines was perhaps to “protect
the minority of students aginst them-
selves.”

“Last year as a freshman,” Powell
countered, “I never found that my
privacy was impeded. In fact, when
girls stayed in the section, most of
the freshmen enjoyed it.” Senior Bob
Carrere agreed, saying that any in-
adjusted

convenience could be

among the residents themselves “just
as when a stereo is played too loud.”

The Council then overwhelmingly
passed a motion to reclaim authority
from SAC concerning _ parietals.
Dean Edward Atwood objected, say-
ing the University Council's action
had “put SAC into an almost im-
possible situation.” He emphasized
that the present parietals procedure
was drawn up by the Student
Affairs Committee last spring after
more than three weeks of varied
testimony and that it had received
“the almost unanimous acceptance
of both faculty and students on the
committee.”

Powell put his proposal to abolish
parietals altogether in the form of
a motion, and an amendment sug-
gested by Mr. Thomas Vinson was
attached, “that each dormitory unit
be required to produce some sort

of visitation hours for women or
instead declare that there are no
restrictive hours.”

Law School representative Charles
Hofheimer observed that “there
seems to be an almost even split,
with one or two exceptions, between
students who live under the system,
and the faculty and administrative
officials, who do not.”

Commented Steve Robinson, “I
personally think that having girls
in the dorm all week under un-
limited conditions is a distinct in-
vasion of privacy.” Dr. Marshall
Jarrett protested that it was “impos-
sible” to make a judgement without
the advantage of testimony which
SAC had heard.

“I hardly get my chair warm,”
said Dr. Edward L. Pinney, “and
find that we are emasculating the
late lamented SAC It seems

Mr. and Mrs. Robert Squier, Media Consultants for Maine Senator Edmund Muskie among others, appeared
for a presentation and press conference in Reid Hall Monday. This was a first of fall semester programs
sponsored by W&L’s Mock Convention,

Media Man Speaks Here

The Squiers decide how their
clients can best use the mass media
to project the desired image. They
begin by getting to know the candi-
date, personally getting to know his
family, personal background and
political philosophy. The Squiers do
not work for candidates they don't
personally support. They also will
not work with a candidate who has
no “media potential,” that is, one
who cannot present a good image
on television,

The Squiers stressed that because
television is relatively new, much re
search must be done in the field
of mass media image-building. They
are pioneers in media polling-inter
viewing the electorate during the
campaign to determine the effective
ness of promotional techniques

The Squiers have guided twenty

five campaigns in the three years
since they incorporated to form the
Communications Company of Wash
ington, DC,

In 1969, the firm advised Presi
dent Ferdinand Marcos of the
Philippines in his successful re-elec-
tion bid. In last year's election, the
company worked for eight different
candidates, including Governor Mar
vin Mandel of Maryland, Governor
Johv Burns of Hawaii, Congressman
John Brademas of Indiana and Sena-
tor Muskie. As a part of their work
for Senator Muskie, the Squiers pro-

Pinney protested that it was for
the Council to usurp SAC’s decision
on parietals, saying “I believe the
larger group is hardly ever able to
improve on the judgement of the
smaller group.”

After discussion ended, the motion
to remove parietal restrictions was
defeated, 11 to 10, All the student
representatives voted in favor, with
the exception of Robinson and
Marshall Washburn; the only faculty
member to vote for the motion was
Dr. David Elmes.

The Council then moved to return
responsibility to review parietals to
SAC, with the understanding that
SAC take into consideration the
sentiments expressed concerning the
current parietal structure.

In other business, Dr. Pinney sug-
gested that the grade of F be
abolished and that a student who
failed a course simply not be granted
credit for the course. He said grade
F was “academically undesirable”
because it “penalized” the student
for taking the course.

ove To Abolish Parietals

Elmes said that such an action
“could allow the student to mani-
pulate his Grade Point Average.
“This would decrease the sensibility
of the grading device used to de-
termine a student’s performance.”
Dean Atwood agreed, saying “I
don’t want to see a student who has
flunked ten courses getting a degree
from Washington and Lee; | think
it would degrade the degree.”

EC Announces Elections,
Limits Campaign Costs

Elections for freshman class
representatives to the University
Council and Executive Committee
and other class officers will be held
Monday, October 18. The E.C. an-
nounced this election date in its
Monday evening meeting.

In other business the committee
selected Fred Paone and Rudd Smith
as student representatives for the
Committee on Intercollegiate Athle-
tics, set a limit of $20 in election
expenses, and heard reports from the
standing committees.

The E.C. said that petitions are
being sought from freshmen candi-
dates for four positions: University
Council representative, E.C. Repre-
sentative, class president and class
vice president. Petitions are due
Monday, October 11. Petitions must
have 60 signatures; freshmen are
allowed to sign more than one peti-
tion. All candidates must submit
their petitions by 6:00 p.m. on the
eleventh to either Rick Gray at
the PiKA House or the E.C. box
in the Student Union.

Elections will be conducted by
Executive Committeemen on the fol-
lowing Monday, October 18. Run-
offs will fall on October 21, the fol
lowing Thursday.

In executive session the E.C. chose
two new members to the Commit-
tee on Intercollegiate Athletics: Fred
Paone and Rudd Smith. Paone is
a senior who plays varsity baseball,
Rudd Smith is a freshman in the
law school. He also serves as an
assistant football coach,

Student Body President Steve
Robinson initiated discussion of
limiting the number of posters that
appear on campus during election
campaigns.

Student Body Secretary Rick Gray
argued that, “the only way is
to limit how much is spent.”

Vice President Glenn Azuma com
mented, “we could limit where stu
dents buy their posters.”

only effective way to prevent this
is limiting the amount of money
spent.”

Gray said a limitation on the
amount a candidate could spend on
his campaign would “have them (the
candidates) come out on issues, not
to come out with names on posters.”
However, Gray did not think the
places that posters could be dis-
played should be limited. He argued
that posters “don’t do that much
damage to the grandeur of the
Colonnade.”

Senior Moon Yee stated that hav-
ing candidates “come out with a
platform is a good thing.” However,
Yee supported the idea of limiting
the placement of posters on campus.

Lock Handley, law representative,
moved that the amount of money
spent be limited in all elections, This
motion passed 6-2.

Senior Jo Jo Martin moved that
itemized lists of election expenses
be submitted to the E.C. by all
candidates. This motion passed 6-1
with one abstention.

Junior Archer Frierson moved
that a $20 ceiling be placed on all
upcoming freshman election cam-
paign expenses, with the under-
standing that this limit could be
altered later. This motion passed 6-2.

Immediately afterwards the presid
ing officer, Steve Robinson moved
that the E.C. pay for space in The
Ring-tum Phi which would allow
candidates to present their plat
forms. This motion also passed with-
out opposition.

Handley announced that the Stu

| OUTLOOK and REVIEW

Wednesday, October 6, 1971

Dormitory parietals came within a single vote of being
eliminated Thursday night. The University Council, which
has authority over student affairs, voted down 11-10 Bob
Carrere’s proposal giving dormitory residents greater freedom
in determining visiting hours for women. The senior from
New Orleans began discussion of this issue last spring. This
year he called for a showdown at the council's first session.
oo. voting was interesting. Only two students voted
against the idea of discontinuing dormitory parietal limits
on “overnight visitation.” These gentlemen were President
of the Student Body, Steve Robinson, and M arshall Washburn.
A sole faculty member, Dr. D. G. Elmes, voted in favor of
Carrere’s proposal.

from the trio of individuals who were menti

\side from these sentiments, The Ring-tum Phi opposes
university limitations on female visitations for several reasons.
Among these reasons stated in an editorial last year in the
May 12 issue are:
1. “The parietals are on the books for appearance, not
enforcement,” i.e. the rules appease parents and alumni
who are not forced to endure these regulations.

quired to become unreasonable informers on
fellow students.

3. “Girls have stayed in the dorms, are staying in the

dorms and probably will continue to stay in the dorms.”

This means the parietals cannot be effectively enforced

as they now exist.

| Such rules contradict Washington and Lee Univer-

sity’s aspirations (according to its formal statement of

institutional philosophy) of “the importance of the
individual, his personal honor and integrity.”

Therefore, the existing parietals allow the W&L students
living in the dormitories only a limited ability to develop their
own integrity and honor. The Ring-tum Phi for these reasons
maintains that parietals should not be tolerated.

But opposition to such an abolition of parietals was voiced
hy students and administrators alike. First on the list of
defenses for parietals was the right of privacy. Steve Robinson
argues that having no guidelines for visiting hours would work
a hardship on some students. Simply taking a shower in
private would be a difficulty with girls present at any hour.
\lso manv W&L students have defended the unisex policies
of WK&L by claiming that girls are too distracting. With girls
running throughout the dorms at any hour the distraction
problem might become acute.

\nother argument, which might be raised by proponents
of parietals, is the unjust rule of a majority of students ov er
a minority. Currently, parietals are endorsed by a vote of
the individual dormitory sections, Theoretically, some indi-
viduals might object to completely open hours and = their
privacy would suffer due to a majority vote. Accordingly, the
limitations of the parietals give these individuals some relief
from the tyranny of the majority.

These arguments are legitimate. But they are fostered by
men who possibly overlook the rational capacities of W&L
men. If some members of the University Council envision
these difficulties, undoubtedly the dormitory dwellers will
envision them also. If these men living in university housing
fail to do so, or forget, at least dormitory counselors are there
to help them remember.

So, the two positions have been presented, The presenta-
tion was not exactly unbiased, but neither is the goal of this
editorial—to help eliminate parietals at W&l

More this The

vraduate proponents of this parietal-free concept need better

action should be taken on issue under
planning to accomplish their objective, Before any additional
discussion can be made, the opinions of W&L freshmen should
he made known. In the very least, the freshman class repre
sentative to the University Council should be heard, In addi
tion the dormitory counselors ought to determine the con
ensus of their outlooks on parietals. All these considerations
this issue is too important to be cast aside

WLUR Begins Fifth Year

By STEPHEN C, WOODRUFF

When I was asked to do a story
on WLUR-FM, I said “Sure,” never
imagining that it would be any dif-
ferent from any other story. I had
a lot to learn, Tracking down station
manager Bob Griffin was my first
problem; I finally found him where
I ought to have looked in the first
place, on the third floor of Reid
Hall, sometimes, although not al-
ways, recognizable as the offices and
studios of WLUR-FM, and in doing
so got a first hand taste of the be-
hind the scenes action that makes
WLUR-FM come out smoothly
(usually) on the air. Any good crea-
tive journalistic atmosphere is a
zoo—Edward Hannibal proves that
in selected portions of “Chocolate
Days, Popsical Weeks” — WLUR’s
offices certainly were Monday.

After waiting an hour and a half
of “be right with you” while Griff
hecticly tried to get things worked
out with a new programing schedule,
we finally took seats in the room

full of cluttered desks known as
“Operations” and talked about
WLUR, that is, between ringing

telephones, clacking teletypes in the
next room, and important interrup-
tions, amid the wall plastered with
posters, papers, and certificates, and
over the drone of Kirk Kirpatrick’s
voice as he pored over a computer
printout and made programing
changes.

This year WLUR plans to cele-
brate its fifth anniversary, on the
air, with as much of a collection
of the original staff as possible,
perhaps even recreating that first
night on the air, February 27, 1967.
At that time Fred C. Cole, then
acting president of the University,
made some remarks which to this
day underline the philosophy of
WLUR. “The purpose of our new
broadcasting station is to enrich the
life of the University and of Lex-
ington and Rockbridge county.”

But a lot of changes have taken
place since that first night on the
air. Originally WLUR’s musical fare
was limited strictly to classical. At
that time also, WLUR was on the
air approximately twenty hours a
week, compared with this fall's ten
or more hours per day. Until May
of 1968, the station played “rock”
music only before football and bas-
ketball games. A Ring-tum Phi edi-
torial at that time stated that students
were “more interested in listening
to Simon and Garfunkle than Bee-
thoven,” and “since the students
finance the station, the station should
cater to their wants with at least
one hour a day of rock ‘n roll
music.” More rock music began to
be aired by WLUR.

Special programs include Sherlock
Holmes, old radio drama, news spec-
ials, and FORUM. WLUR receices
special programs from distributors
for possible airing. Sitting in the
office now is one called “The Ameri-
can Indian.” Anybody want to hear
it? December 11 WLUR will be
again broadcasting the Metropolitan
Opera.

Today WLUR is known as “Lex-
ington's other radio station.” Griff
was happy to elaborate on that say-

ing, “The whole idea of WLUR is
to provide an alternative to the
radio listener. You could go all the
way across the country just pushing
the buttons on your radio and you'd
always hear the same thing. The
voices would change, but that’s
about it. We program music and
programs which commercial stations
cannot or will not.”

Bob went on to stress “WLUR
has something for everybody. We're
a service station, a listener’s station,
If somebody would like to hear
something, all they have to do is
let us know and we'll try to give it
to them, whether it’s a certain type
of music or a special on VD in
Rockbridge county.” WLUR _ is
classified as “educational” radio, and
Griff says that’s what they are;

“WLUR provides the people of this
area with information—news, sports,
public interest programs, discussions
of current problems.”

Currently WLUR'’s
contains a large dose of public
affairs — FORUM, a WLUR pro-
duction, discusses current issues of
interest—a wide range of music—
country-western, jazz and blues, big
bands, gospel, underground rock
(Ghunga’s Revenge), classics, soul,
and top forty rock (The Mighty
Moog)—and complete coverage of
news and sports. WLUR’s “Home
Edition” is the only source of daily
news in Rockbridge county, As all
of you avid radio listeners know,
WREL also pitches in and carries
WLUR’s production of “Home Edi-
tion.”

programing

 

January is the target date for
WLUR to become an even larger
news center than it now is. At that
time WLUR is to begin acting as
a clearing house for Associated Press
Voice transmissions for the state of
Virginia. For example, if a Rich-
mond station has a tape of Governor
Holton making some newsworthy
comments, they send it to WLUR,
WLUR informs all the other stations
in the state that they have it. If
one of them wants to use it, they
call WLUR, and get hooked up to
the tape. It is a subscription service
of A.P. which WLUR gets to use
free for its service.

“We always have some attrition
after we post the travelling squad,”
W&L Coach Buck Leslie said. “We
only took 44 people to Towson out
of 65. Twenty-one had to be left
behind.”

Ford said he and White are not

Ever since the passage of the
twenty-sixth amendment, granting
the franchise to all those over the
age of eighteen, it has become virtu-
ally axiomatic to urge the newly
entitled to register. However, the
recent action of Federal Judge
Robert Merhig ordering the regis-
tration lists, originally scheduled to
be closed last Friday, to be held
open for one additional week, makes
it all the more imperative for Wash-
ington and Lee students who are, as
yet, unregistered to attempt to
register here in Lexington.

There are problems with this, The
City, for all its fine words, has
done its best to discourage students
from exercizing their franchise, and
it accordingly requires some di-
plomacy and discretion to fight
through the bureaucratic red tape
and convince the County Registrar
(who is, incidentally, located in the
County Courthouse on the corner
of Washington and Main), that one
is a decent, deserving citizen.

Important elections are to be held
here in Virginia this November.
Both houses of the State Legislature
are up for election, and, most im-
portant of all, a Lieutenant Gov-
ernor is being selected to fill the
remaining term of the late J. Sargent
Reynolds. These races are, perhaps,
of merely academic interest to those

from outside Virginia, yet they are
reflections of a popular sentiment
shown by all residing here: if you,
as a student, have any concern for
this state, then by all means speak
up and show your feelings by taking
the time and interest to register and
vote.

It is often said that the student
vote is of little import, for it is
watered down by the ballots of the
native populace. Yet, there is so
much more to politics than merely
the casting of votes! Student political
groups, where well-organized and
well-run, have had a_ considerable
impact on the political constitution
of a locality; here at W&L, the Uni-
versity Republicans, for example,
have been a significant factor in the
shift of Rockbridge County from a
one-party to a two-party area which
now has not only a Republican
State Senator but, in addition, a Re-
publican Congressman. The Young
Democrats, for many years mori-
bund, have been resuscitated and
may—with student support—play as
important a role in local politics as
has their sister club. Each candi-
date, in addition, can well use any
help that you—as individuals—are
able to tender.

One of the local candidates for
the House of Delegates has pointed
out the discrepancy between the per-
centage of lawyers in the General
Assembly — 67% — and the much
lower percentage among the general
populace. While it is important that
only those who understand the com-
plexities of the law be authorized
by the electorate to amend and frame
legislation, still there is tremendous
room here for some form of broad-
ening the power base through which
we are ruled,

Utilize your right, or else it shall
through apathy, atrophy and dis-
appear, and then—when you have
deservedly been penalized for your
unthinking sloth—none shall be-
moan the iniquities of your fate as
much as you!

As the dealine for submitting fra-
ternity preferences draws near, many
freshmen who have participated in
Rush have been dragged through a
multitude of pro-fraternity informa-
tion and are now wondering as to
whether there even exists an al-
ternative to joining a fraternity at
Washington and Lee. Socially, athle-
tically, and financially, they compare
fraternity life to that of independ-
ence without actually being able to
explore the independent aspects of
living at W&L.

and more of an important role at
WA&L. According to Dean of Stu-
dents Lewis G. John, the trend to
day is definitely towards independent
life. “Ten years ago, 85 per cent
of the students were associated with
fraternities,” Dean John said. “The
percentage is steadily dropping.
Freshmen are finding more and
more alternatives to fraternities.”
The University has aided in pro-
moting independent life at W&L for
students who cannot, mainly for

Generals Fall to Colonels 17-7

With All Scoring in First Half

By LEWIS HIXSON

The Washington and Lee Generals
dropped a 17-7 decision to Centre
College here Saturday with all the
scoring coming in the first half.
The score did not really indicate the
type of game that took place as
WAL gathered more total yardage
(260 compared to 212) and made
several drives into Colonel territory
during the second half.

Centre won the toss to start the
game and elected to kick, defending
the south goal. John Loising took
the kickoff on his own 8 and re-
turned it 18 yards to the W&L 26.
Steve Fluharty then guided the Blue
team down the field mixing two
pass plays to Conrad and Baldwin
with runs by himself, Jim Farrar
and Jo Jo Martin. With 8:12 re-
maining in the first quarter Fluharty
followed a block by Farrar to score
from one yard out, Fluharty had
guided the Blue offense 74 yards in
14 plays to put the Generals ahead
by a 7-0 margin following the point
after by Doug Chase.

The folllowing kickoff was re-
covered by Centre on its own 47
after an attempted onside kick by
the Generals failed. A personal foul

penalty for piling on moved the ball
into good field position for the
Colonels—the W&L 38. It looked
like the visitors were going to
follow suit as Harry Sykes moved
his team to first and ten at the
WA&L 13. It was then that the Blue
defense went to work and held the
Colonels to nine yards on four
plays to regain the football.

The General offense was held to
six yards in three plays reaching
only their nine yard line and Chappy
Conrad was called on to punt it
away from his own end zone. He
did a beautiful job, punting the ball
49 yards to the Centre 42 where it
was downed by Bill Baldwin.

Centre then moved to the W&L
33 where on first down Steve Camp-
bell swept right end for the 33 yards
and the score. The extra point was
good and it was 7-7 with 13:24
left in the half. W&L received the
kickoff and moved to its own 43
before the Colonel defense stiffened
and the Generals were forced to
punt. Greg Ely received Conrad's
punt on his own 13 and almost
broke loose returning the football to
his own 43 before being tripped up
by John Newman.

Centre and W&L then exhanged
punts when neither team was able to
move, with the Colonels getting the
better end of it and achieving good
field position on the W&L 33. Sykes
and Ely then combined efforts to
move in for a touchdown with 3:50
remaining in the half. The PAT was
good and the Colonels held a 14-7
lead.

W&L’s Loesing returned the kick-
off 19 yards to his own 27. On the
first play from scrimmage Fluharty
fumbled after a eight yard gain and
Leising covered it for Centre on the
Blue 38. The colonels moved to the
General 25 where on third down
Dave Brooks broke up a pass from
Sykes to MacQuarles. This brought
on Tom Bennett to attempt a field
goal. The kick was good from 35
yards out and with 29 seconds left
in the half, Centre had jumped out
to a 17-7 lead. The Generals were

Ruggers Drop Opener 23-0

Washington and Lee’s Rugby
Club started this season the same as
they did the last, dropping the
opener to the always tough Virginia
Tech, 23-0, Sunday on Alumni Field.

Although the final score indicates
a lashing at the hands of quick, well-
organized Tech, the W&L men were
not so much outplayed as they were
outlasted in the grueling hour of
no substitution, no time out play.

At the half Tech held a narrow one *
try lead, 4-0. Washington and Lee °

had gotten the ball moving around
in the backfield for a couple of long
runs but failed to get the ball over
either time.

But in the second half, W&L’s in-
experience and lack of practice
showed up, and Tech scored two
more quick tries and got one of the
kicks for two extra points. Later
in the game Tech scored three more
points on a penalty kick and then
put the lid on things with another
try and kick after. Tech’s standout
back, scored three of Tech’s four
tries, as the W&L ruggers simply
weren't able to hold him down.

Putting in noteworthy perform-
ances for the home club were full-
back Fred Fletcher, who often kick-
ed the ball safely downfield in the
face of a maddening rush, and
Tom Barton, who defensively allow-
ed nothing to get past him, (caus-
ing his Tech counterpart to spend
most of the game on the ground).

The W&L ruggers faired slightly
better in the “B” game, aided by
several Tech rookies, as the Blue
fell a few men short of making up
a second team while Tech boasted
bodies to spare. The “B” team fell
20-14, on Tech's five trys, while
W&L picked up two from a Tech
wing back, one from their own Carl
Cassidy, and two points on a suc-

week to play Old Dominion on

Saturday, the ninth, and will play
Duke at Sweet Briar on the 17th.
You can see the ruggers at home
again on Alumni Field on the 24th,
pitted against U.Va.

Action can get extremely rough during a crum.

The ruggers could use some sup-

affinity for violence and a body to
contribute is welcome to join the
WAL striking force. And for those
who do... well, there’s always the
traditional bash afterwards to heal
those battle scars.

(Continued from page 3)
financial reasons, join a fraternity.
The relaxation of university regula-
tions in recent years, on subjects
such as automobiles, dormitory
drinking, and entertaining girls in
dormitory rooms, has, in essence,
attempted to make domitory social
life equal that of a fraternity. Also,
the establishment of the Student
Center has helped to bring inde-
pendents social equity with fraterni-
ties through the sponsoring of
dances, mixers, and the like.

Athletically, the Independent
Union handles an extensive intra-
mural program for those students
not affiliated with fraternities, Any
independent who has an interest in
the intramural program may partici-
pate through the Independent Union
for a small fee used to cover the
University’s intramural fees.

Financially, students generally find
independent life somewhat less ex-
pensive than that of fraternity liv-
ing, especially in his freshman year,
since all fraternity assessments then
are in addition to the normal uni-
versity expenses. In the freshman
year, pledge and _ initiation fees
usually make up a fairly large
amount of this assessment. In addi-
tion, monthly social expenses, which
may exceed what a student would
plan to spend socially whether he
joined a fraternity or not, are also
tacked on to these assessments.

As an upperclassman, the financial
comparison is complicated by the
problem of independent housing at
Washington and Lee, At the present
time, fraternal life shows a major
advantage here, at least for the
sophomore year, when fraternity
members generally reside in the
houses.

There is presently a distinct on-
campus housing problem at W&L.
Approximately 75 room openings
are available in the upper-class
dormitories, University officials and
student advisors will soon begin
planning for construction of new
upperclass dormitories which, ac-
cording to Dean John, “could be
opened by September, 1973.” How-
ever, judging from the experience of
Washington and Lee with construc-
tion work at the present time, the
tentative date of Fall, 1973, would
probably be extended into the school
year of 1973-74, so that 1974 would
be about the most realistic date for
the full use of these proposed dormi-
tories.

Here, then, fraternity life pre-
sents a distinct advantage for up-
perclassmen, particularly sopho-
mores. However, the folding of sev-
eral fraternities in recent years has
offset this security, of having a
place to live, with its own insecurity,
of perhaps encountering the financial
woes of a highly unstable fraternity.
Again, even with the shortage of
on-campus housing, independents
may reside in apartments, of which
there is a fairly adequate number
in Lexington. These apartments may
be rented normally for prices com-
parable to that of a dormitory or
fraternity room.

Elsewhere financially for upper-
classmen independents, board is at
least on par with if not usually less

SECS SS

expensive than that of a fraternity.
Social expenses are an added assess-
ment in fraternities, and they may or
may not exceed what the student
may plan to spend socially, Also,
added expenses must be accounted
for in fraternity life, such as those
for house upkeep.

Another question in the minds of
freshmen is whether association with
a fraternity is an advantage to run-
ning for an office in a campus
organization. “To the extent that fra-
ternities encourage their members to
join organizations, I think this is
true,” states Dean John. “It de-
pends on the individual. Being in
a fraternity is no longer the prere-
quisite for high campus office that
it once was.” In general, the election
of a student to a campus office,
then, relies more upon his individual
personality than upon his fraternity
association.

There is, then, a strong alterna-
tive to fraternity life at Washington
and Lee. More and more students
are shunning fraternal association
for the life of an independent. There
are advantages to both fraternity
and independent life, and the choice
must be made by the student as to
what to do. He must come to a
decision, through presentations by
both sides and through his own
observations, as to whether to join
a fraternity or not, and above all,
the decision must be his own.

Re: Mock Convention

(Continued from page 2)
was a major antecendent of the dis-
cretion of the chief executive and
Jefferson did not even seek anything
like a Tonkin Gulf Resolution to
make it.

We share the apprehension about
perpetuating some elements of the
established order. Like “law and
order,” “working within the system”
has become a code phrase. To many
it connotes repressive tolerance.
Even with that in mind, it should be
noticed that the Democratic Party
has been attempting to reform it-
self since 1968. Sen. George Mc-
Govern, a man well-known to this
campus, and Rep. Donald Fraser, a
former chairman of the Democratic
Study Group, headed one and Rep.
James O'Hara, a progressive Michi-
gan Democrat, headed the other, It
could be that the work of these
groups will insure that the next
Democratic Convention will be dif-
ferent from and better than Chicago.

Nicholas von Hoffman, a writer
not known for his kind regard for
national politicians of any stripe,
has commented that the next Demo-
cratic nominee would probably be
chosen by a more truly democratic
process than our generation has
seen, That, in his opinion, made the
Democratic nomination worth pursu-
ing in 1972. It could be that the
process has something to offer us
yet. None of us can know unless
we try it. If we reject it out of
hand, we abdicate our right to make
our own history.

Sierra Club

There will be a short meeting
for those students, faculty and
townspeople who might be interested
in knowing more about the Sierra
Club. The meeting will be at 7:30
p.m. Monday, October 11, 1971, &
Room 8 Newcomb Hall on campus.
The Sierra Club is perhaps the lead-
ing conservation group in the nation.

Long associated with conservation
efforts in the far West the Sierra
Club has recently become active in
the East and a Virginia chapter has
been started. Prof. Milton Colvin,
a member of both the Sierra Club
and the Wilderness Society, will
briefly outline some of the program
to be undertaken here in Virginia
and answer any questions about the
general purpose of the club and
explain what one has to do to join,

Soccer

It was one of those games when
you wish the outcome was decided
by which team played the best
last Tuesday as the Washington and
Lee soccer team lost to Eastern
Mennonite, 4-2. The Generals out-
played, outhustled, and outfought
Eastern Mennonite, but when the
final whitle blew, the Blue was be-
hind in what really counts — the
score.

Except for the first eight minutes
when Eastern Mennonite scored four
goals, the Generals were in com-
mand all the way. Freshman Jimmy
Fox provided both of W&L’s goals,
as the Blue squad outshot their op-
ponents 22 to 10. Jim Kahn started
at goalie for the Generals but was
replaced by Paul Devine, who held
the opposition scoreless.

On Friday the team travelled to
Madison for a game, but found the
field under too much water to play.
Madison officials were reluctant to
have their new field torn up, so the
game has been rescheduled for
October 11, weather permitting. The
Generals also have another game
today at Lynchburg College. Satur-
day the booters will face Old
Dominion.

unable to move following the kickoff

Although there was no scoring in
the second half, The Generals domi-
nated the game for 30 minutes. The
Blue defense held the Colonels to
only 46 yards total offense and three
first downs in the last half, The
Blue offense collected nine first
downs and 156 total yards but were
unable to put it together for a score.
The General defense appears to
be greatly improved over last year
on the basis of these first two games.
The offense has shown that it can
move the football. With a little more
experience the team will develop
into a well operating unit. Conrad
and Baldwin have proved that they
are capable receivers and Fluharty
seems to be back in the groove, hit-

ting on 14 of 21 attempted passes.

Operation Of WLUR Explained

say just how many people work on
the station.” Journalism classes do
writing for the station, thirty people
do news, about thirty more do air
work, and there are two staffs of
ten to twenty people each that do
special programs. Of course, there is
some overlap. There is a core of
about ten people who are the heart
of the station and keep everybody
else in line; among these are Griff,
of course, Chet Burgess, Chief Engi-
neer, Jay Denny, Program Director,
Tom Rowe, News Director, Kirk
Kirkpatrick, Operations Director,
and Prof. R. H. MacDonald, Gen-
eral Manager, affectionately known
by the staff as “Boss.”

WLUR hasn't had any trouble
finding bodies (maybe the athletic
department should come to them);
Griff put it this way, “We don't
have any trouble finding people to
push buttons over there (in the
control room). Pushing buttons is
fun, but there is a lot of work be-
hind it.” After being in that office,
I'm not going to contest his state-

credit, added, “Air time is a benefit.
You have to do all the work first.”

Wayne Baker can tell you how
much work there is to do over
there. In his early days with the
station, he came over to do the five
o'clock news, and got stuck with the
six as well, and then the 7:15 busi-
ness report and reading the editorial.
That included going through all the
information off the teletype and the
whole days list of stock quotations,
when, as he said, he “hardly knew
anything about it.”

Bob Ford, who does a jazz blues
show on WLUR, summed it all up
when he said, “WLUR is all other
radio stations rolled into one; it
brings you everything you could ask
for,”

One Vote Kills Move To Abolish Parietal Control

(Continued from page 1)

“Twenty-five years ago,” said
President Huntley, “many thought
it wrong to allow students to stay
for more than four years until
they accumulated enough credits,”
Discussion was tabled until the next
session.

In the final topic of the evening,
it was recommended by representa-
tives of the various student commit-
tees of the EC that the advisory
bodies be merged with their parent
faculty committee. “There is a
considerable beauracracy involved,
which is no one’s fault,” said Roger
Munsick, chairman of the Curri-
culum Committee. “It would be bet-
ter to have people on the spot to

offenders.”

Lee said, “one problem is that
people are slow to show up for
meetings concerning fines for bad
checks picked up and honored by
the committee.”

Lock Handley asked Chuck Lee
how many of the offenders were law
students. Lee reported that last year
only three or less of the total 250
offenders were law students, Lee
went on to say about $2,000 in bad
checks were honored by the commit-
tee last year.

“Some people feel the school
should not have responsibilities over
their financial matters,” Lee con-
tinued.

The E.C. took no action regard-
ing the Student Financial Relations
Committee but did make recom-
mendations. It was recommended by
E.C. members that fines might be
raised and that notification of bad
check hearings be sent through the
office of the Dean of Students.

Larry Evans submitted the Stu-
dent Recruitment Committee report.
Evans told the E.C. that some com-
mitteemen had already made a re-
cruiting trip to Martinsville, Virginia
this year. He claimed that seven

make decisions, to say yes or no,”
The consensus seemed to conclude
that student committees would have
to be reduced before any such
merger, and that students could not
be included on any matters except
general policy on the Admissions
and Financial Aid Committees,
“Arriving at a workable number
for commitee representation would
be the big point of contention,” said
Dean of Admissions James Farrar.
Dean Atwood suggested that per-
haps “it could work both ways” so
that instead, faculty members could
sit on student committees to provide
the necessary liaison. Discussion on
this matter will also be continued
during the session next month,

additional recruiting trips were plan-
ned before November.

Larry summarized the two-fold
goal of his group as “recruiting un-
deprivileged students and
securing funds for their support.”

The University Center-Orientation
Committee report came from chair-
man Stan Harris. Harris said the
University Center had held two
dances at a loss of about $100. A
film company has agreed to supply
the University with movies for 50c
commission of a 75c admission
charge. The first film is “American
Dream,” scheduled to be shown in
mid-October.

Steve Robinson voiced a complaint
about the service in the University
tavern, the Cockpit. Robinson stated
that the people who work in the
Cockpit “are as slow as molasses
when it comes to service.” Harris
promised to investigate,

Steve Greene turned in the Stu-
dent Control Committee report.
Only organizational meetings have
been held so far, No cases have
come before the committee to date.

Library Committee Chairman Bill
West sent his report. The student
committee has voted to merge with
the Faculty Library Committee.
Steve Robinson explained that such
a merger might be wise since the
two duplicate each other, and each
serves only in an advisory capacity.
