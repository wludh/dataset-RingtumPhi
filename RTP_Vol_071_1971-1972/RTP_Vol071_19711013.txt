Freshmen To Vote Monday

The Executive Committee announc-

ed during its Monday night meeting
that petitions had been received for
the Freshman class elections, which
will be held Monday, October 18.
Polls will be open in the Freshman
Quad from 8 a.m, to 4 p.m., and any
resulting run-offs will be decided in
voting on Thursday.

Members of the Class of 1975
will choose from a field of seven
candidates for Class President; four,
for Vice-President; five, for EC rep
resentative; and three, for University
Council representative.

The following freshmen have filed
for President; Bill Biesel, Carl Cas
sidy, Jon Clark, William Datz, Jeff-
rey Fischer, Louis LeLaurin, and
John Keith,

Running for Vice-President are:
Tom Lancaster, Bill Lasseter, David
Rigby, and Duke Stevens. In the EC
Contest are the following freshmen:
Duncan DeGraff, Tav Lupton, Paul

Malin, William Scott, and Barney
Skelton. Running for University
Council seat: Bob Keatley, Larry
Lyles, Steven Mehaffey.

In other action the EC decided to
procure the removal of the identifi-
cation machines recently placed in
the Evans Dining Hall. Student Body
President Steve Robinson presented
for consideration a petition, initiat-
ed by senior Gary Sprunk, which
bore 57 names calling for the re-
moval of the card-punch system.

Robinson said that the manager
of W&L’s Dining facility, Jerry

Darrell, had indicated that it was
possible that the machines be phased

out. Darrell said that the ARA-Sla-
ter Food system, with which the
WAL facility is contracted, requires

identification cards for any school
serving more than 500 meals. But, it
was pointed out, the University in-
volved could reject the machines if
they had reason to do so,

“I think there’s a valid point on
honor to be made here,” said Law
representative Lock Handley. “There
needs to be instances on display to
show where the honor system works
—it seems to me the Dining Hall
would be happy to go along with it.”

Robinson said that many students
who are not contracted with, but
who eat often in, the Dining Hall,

W&L Students Tutoring

Ihe program through which W&L
students volunteer to serve as tutors
in the Lexington schools will be get-
ting under way this week. Students
who offer their services are assigned
to assist regular teachers at either
the local elementary or the junior
high schools, usually for one hour,
twice a week,

At present the program could use
20-25 more volunteers to complete
the current schedule. Anyone inter
ested should see one of the two liai-
son directors on the W&L faculty:
Dr. George Ray in Payne 32B or
Dr. Thomas Imeson in Howe 313.

Dr. Ray explained that the work
involves helping a regular teacher,
either at the Waddell Elementary
School or the Lylburn-Downing
School (grades 5, 6 and 7) at some
period during regular school hours,
8:30 am. to 3:00 p.m. The needs
seem to be primarily in mathematics,
science, English, social studies, and
special education.

Ray added that the volunteer help
may involve, if desired, more than
academic aid, perhaps by taking on

“big brother” function outside of
class for underprivileged children
who for some reason need special at-
tention and companionship.

“The student volunteer may be
used more imaginatively by the
teacher,” said Ray. “He may con

ceivably help with the entire class or,
as is usually the case, work with in-
dividual pupils on a one to one
basis.”

The program was begun two years
ago under the aegis of the PTA. It
has been enthusiastically received by
the local principals, and the teachers
themselves have expressed apprecia-
tion for the invaluable help given by
the W&L students who have worked
with them in the past. With recent
budget cuts, the schools are finding
an increasing need for volunteer aid
to help maintain the quality of the
schools,

“By and large, the students have
been doing it because they really
feel the need; they realize its some-
thing beneficial, not just eyewash,
but a real help,” Ray remarked.

It was emphasized that the pro-
gram can use as much or as little
time as a student feels he can af-
ford. In fact, there have been several
spin-offs from this program in the
past years, which sometimes have re-
sulted in academic credit.

Bruce Ritz, a W&l junior
from Lexington, has undertaken a
related project under the auspices of
a Robert E. Lee Research Grant.
He will explore the individual modes
of instruction in the elementary
classroom.

Senior David Raine taught poetry

“very successfully” to a sixth grade
English class during the spring se-
mester, in an accredited project with
a R. E. Lee Grant-in-Aid. He work-
ed up a proposal whereby 40-50 stu-
dents might be involved in a similar
effort.

“This program has helped to
break down some of the community
prejudices, and the local teachers
have been very happy to receive this
help,” Ray concluded. “But the stu-
dents are not in it for their image,
they’re in it because they want to

. and because they want to see the
quality of the system improved.”

After discussion the EC passed
Glen Azuma’s motion, accepting
Sprunk’s petition and calling for the

emphasized that the Honor System
does indeed apply to the Dining
Hall, and that those who fail to pay
are risking an honor violation.

Lastly, the EC discussed what sort
of limitations should be instituted on
student election campaigns. After
restricting freshmen to $20 per can-

EC debated whether or not a cost
limit was the correct course,

Russ Fletcher said that the spend-

any EC action regarding future elec-

“I think what we've done,” said
Robinson, “is to force candidates to

Handley pointed out that it would be
difficult to police any such restric-

future date when the results of the
freshman election may give some in-

The Hand Chair was (naturally) hand-carved,

War Research Is Possible,
According To Karl Deutsch

portance in today’s world to that of
a “study of infection in the age of
the Black Death.” The Czechoslo-
vakian-born professor developed his
topic in five steps: a definition of
war, a study of recent war history,
a comparison of limited war to all-
out war, a discussion of the causes
of war, and the presentation of pos-
sible deterrents to war in the future.

In defining war itself, Professor
Deutsch suggested four criteria. He
implied that battle deaths are overt
the level of 1000 men in a war, as
compared to a skirmish, incident, or
the like. He also theorized that “war
is prepared for in advance,” citing
growing defense budgets, military
training, and weapons build-up as
prerequisites to a war,

The guest lecturer noted,
wars are legitimized by the state,”
as a third defining quality. “They
(the citizens of a country) are being
aught that someday their govern
ment may call on them to fight
The nations, then, teach their citi
zens to accept war. As a final requis
ite to war, Professor Deutsch noted
the institutionalization of war in a
country. “Men spend their lives pre
paring for war; wars are a part of
the normal life of nations.” He cited

also

Macbeth’

armies, navies and military budgets
as some of the many institutions of
war.

The speaker then gave a_ brief
study of recent war history, particul-
arly the period from 1816-1955. He
noted the occurence of 100 wars in
that period of time, at the rate of

one every 18 months. “On the
whole,” he said, “usually less than
three per cent of the countries of

the world are at war at one time.”
He pointed out that for a specific
country, war usually follows a rhy-
thm of 15-20 years, because the
effect of a recent war tends to pro-
mote peace in the country’s mind
for such a period. However, he cau
tioned that “you still can by all
means have wars in off-peak years.”

Dr, Duetsch also noted the growth
of war in recent history, attributing
this growth to greater and more
complex alliances and to an increase
in war's “deadlines”. He
gested that wars may be
vastating than statistics imply, as
seen in the fact that, though there
8.000.000 battle or direct
deaths in World War Il, there were
also approximately 42,000,000 more

OUTLOOK ani REVIEW

October 13, 1971

Alumni Questions, Answers

Last weekend Washington and Lee University sponsored
an alumni conference. The event was characterized by lunches,
banquets, cocktail parties, speeches, and some very serious
discussion.

About 60 alumni attended the three-day program. Many
represented the various alumni chapters across the nation,
Others participated in the affairs because they were invited
class agents. And still other alumni appeared simply because
they were concerned.

The entourage had widely dispersed origins. Some alumni
journeyed from as far as Los Angeles; others lived right here
in Lexington. The oldest W&L man to appear was Will H.

sarrett, class of 1921. At the opposite end of the spectrum was
Matt Cole, a June graduate, and the most recently departed
alumnus to attend.

Twenty-seven faculty members, students, and administra-
tors fielded questions from the alumni. Those questions touch-
ed on almost all aspects of the operation of Washington and
Lee University. The alumni were especially interested in stu-
dent life on campus. Some of their key questions were:

Are fraternities dying?

What are students interested in?

What is the admissions picture?

Is student activism a problem ?

How bad a drug problem exists at W&L?

What has happened to conventional dress? Here are the an-
swers:

The alumni were told that fraternities do have a place at
Washington and Lee. Fraternity membership has declined in
recent years; three houses have gone out of business. Inter-
fraternity Council President Rob LaRue hypothesized that fra-
ternity membership would level off at about 50% of the stu-
dent body.

Concerning what are the interests of today’s students, the
alumni received a general answer to their question, According
to Dean William Schildt, W&L men are expressing growing
interest in creative fields. Over half of the undergraduates are
exposed to the arts, music, or drama through courses or extra-
curricular activities.

Dean of Admissions James Farrar shed light on the ad-
missions situation for the benefit of the alumni. He said 350
freshmen were accepted for the present freshman class out of
1260 applicants. The number of applicants was up from about
1250 last year. Farrar compared this increase of applicants
with as much as a 20% decrease in private eastern colleges,
especially the Ivy League. Dean Farrar felt more men wanted
to attend W&L because the school “continued to be a superior
institution.”

Student activism is not very evident this year the student
representatives explained, Only a few radicals were openly ad-
mitted to be attending W&L. Steve Robinson, President of
the Student Body, concluded that “the student body is basic
ally conservative, more liberal than in the past, yet still con-
servative.”

The alumni were informed by students and administrators
that drugs were not a insurmountable problem at W&L. The
use of hard drugs was thought to be extremely rare, but all
the students concurred that a majority of their peers had tried
marijuana. Also the school’s tripartite approach of counseling,
educating and punishing drug users was explained in detail to
certain alumni,

One of the major problems in the eyes of the alumni is the
recent decline of conventional dress i.e. coat and tie. Students
justified their rejection of conventional dress for a pair of
reasons, First, it was argued that dress is an individual thing
and should not be enforced by others. Second, students con-
tended that the tradition was not vital to maintaining the
spirit of Washington and Lee. They said the coat and tie ap-
pearance was only a superficial aspect of what WAL. truly
stands for.

\ final concern of W&L alumni was the recruitment of
blacks. Dean Farrar related te the W&L graduates the Admis
sions Office's six year effort to interest blacks in attending
our institution, The actions of the Student Recruitment Com
mittee were cited in this effort,

The questions and incomplete answers presented here have
a direct effect on you and your brief stay in Lexington, The
We&L graduates usually contribute a significant portion of the
total cost of every student's education at Washington and Lee
through alumni donations, These contributions allow the uni
versity to operate. Therefore, the alumni have a vital interest
in protecting their investment, W&L.

The Rockbridge Area Problem
Center, located at 323 North Main
Street in Lexington, is slated to open
on October 30. Legally known as
the Lexington Crisis Center, Inc., it
is a non-profit corporation staffed by
trained volunteers and designed to
serve three basic functions: 1) to
provide immediate aid and comfort
to those people faced with a prob-
lem situation; 2) to supply available
information and 3) to refer those in
need to already. established sources
of aid.

Following a name contest open to

all local residents last summer, the
core committee of the center chose
“REACH-OUT” as an_ unofficial
name. The center will be open 24
hours a-day, seven days a week, and
all its services are free. It is designed
for the use of the entire community,
and it will seek the support of the
community as a whole, It is empha-
sized that REACH-OUT is not sim-
ply a drug center, but will handle
all types of problems in all areas.
Immediate aid will be given over
the phone or in person to deal with
problems like drug emergencies,

runaways, personal hang-ups or
other crises of a less serious nature,
Volunteers will be prepared to ex-
plore objectively with a person the
possible consequences and alterna-
tives of a problem or an impending
decision.

The center will supply factual in-
formation about public agencies al-

Admission Policies Reflect
State Of Today’s Economy

BY ANDY SIMPSON
“Although the University is locat-
ed in the South. its student body rep-
resents broad geographic. social, and
economic cross sections of the na-
tion . . . The University seeks stu-
dents without regard to race of re-
higion and strives to achieve econo-
mie and sdcial diversity among its
students . . . Economic backgrounds
of students vary widely, and the
University is able to give financial
assistance to all studenis with need.”
The Washington and Lee Board
of Admissions, the Department of
Finaneial Aid, and the Student Re-
cruitment Committee are concerned
with the above policies as stated in
the 1971-72 BULLETIN. Their task
in trying to fulfill these objectives
for the good of the University is
considerable and, in the words of
James Farrar, Dean of Admis<ions,
is a perpetual battle. Still, though.
these victories gained in this Pattle
are important enough to rule out
any withdrawal of troops, That is.
the University has no intention of
giving up the fight.

Statistics, although sometimes mis-
leading, can tell part of the story.
For instance, geographical distribs-
tion in the freshman class includes
representation of 34 states, D. C..
and one foreign country. Last year.
42 states, D.C.. two US. territories,
and seven foreign countries were
represented. In this respect, WAL is.
for a school of its size, among the
top in the nation.

Yet, as Dean Farrar sees if. “geo
graphic diversity probably means
less than it did years ago. say in
1920. Everyone drives the same hind
of cars, drinks the same Cokes, end
wears Levi's, There are no ten
gallon hats to distinguish the Texan
from ‘the Massachusetts student.
There is very little regionalism, as
such.” However, social and econc-
mic diversity are becoming increas
ingly important and it is in the pro
cess of striving for these two goals
that admissions people confront their
toughest foes.

“You recognize the importance of
this social and economic diversity
but your funds have to grow to
make it possible.” Dean Farrar
notes, ft is in this area of increas
ing funds that the biggest headaches
are realized. Funds, or the lack of
them, is the biggest, single barrier to
increased economic and social di
versity at WAL. Por that reason the
Student Recruitment Committee. un
der President James Davis, consid
ers fund-raising as its number one
priority the year. The S.R¢

from the Calder Foundation of New
York last year and, although erate

The University, through its own
funds and those available
federal programs

lhrotigh

provides tehitly

more than $500,000 dollars in finan-
cial aid. This figure includes granis,
loans, and scholarships for 23-24%
of the student body which is a slight
but definite drop of one to two per-
centage points from the percent
aided in previous years.

Rising costs and the burden of
previous commitments to returning
upperclassmen on financial aid make
it impossible for the University to
now guarantee “assistance to all stu-
dents with need.” This condition
greatly affects the behavior of the
S.R.C. as its concern is the recrvit-
ment of students, with emphasis on
those who would be considered un-
derprivileged. In its recruitment of
underprivileged students, the Com-
mittee has to be careful not to over-
sell the University. That is. they
have to impress upon the student
that the University wants them and
that they should apply, but that
there can be no guarantee of finan-
cial aid.

Any recruitment of applicants to
day contends with the competitive-
ness of low tuition ai state schools:
a present preference for larger. more
urban schools; and the trend toward
co-education, For these and various
personal considerations, applicants
may turn down offers from Wash-
ington and Lee. Thus to attract can
didates WAL has to have something
to offer and has to let it be known.

“You still have to let all the public
know that WAL exists and offers ex-
cellent programs—you have to let
all strong students regardless of
background learn about WAL.”
Dean Farrar believes that the Uni
versity that fails to do this will find
itself dependent solely upon that se-
lect group which can afford the ex-
pense of a private education. With
limited diversity such as that. the
prospects for a quality education are
also limited,

In its recruitment ef underprivil-

eged students and those applicants
without financial need, admissions
people “do not aim for tokenism.”
assures Jim Davis, President of the
S.R.C, “Te do so,” he contends
would be detrimental to both the
school and the student.” The results
of successful recruitment of quali
lied students are “an enrichment of
life here at W&L,” as well as the
opportunity for a quality education
on the part of the student. To assure
these benefits, “we have to be care
ful not to lower standards by accept
ing unqualified underprivileged stu-
denis.”

There are cighteen students now
at WAl who are considered under
privileged by admissions people, As
a fule, admissions people dislike
classifying applicants as such (we
are making ‘people’ decisions.” as
Dean Noell puts it and dealing with
individuals and individual criteria)

a student whose parental contribu-
tion to his educational costs is less
than $600. Eighteen such students
out of a total student population of
1600 does not alone constitute social
and economic diversity. More diver-
sity is evident in that about 23%
of the student body receives some
sort of financial aid.

Thus, the diversity now at W&L

the person to medical, psychiatric,
legal, or religious personnel who are
best qualified to handle the situation.
In this role the center will attempt
to coordinate all the existing com-
munity services and programs. It
has compiled lists of professionals,
paraprofessionls, clergymen and lay-
men who might be of help.

Ail exchanges with REACH-OUT
will be held strictly confidential in
order to maintain the trust necessary
as a basis for problem solving. Every
call and visit to the center will be
recorded to keep the program on a
professional level.

REACH-OUT originated in discus-
sions among Ken Lane, the Univer-
sity Center Director; the Rev, Mich-
ael Dwinell; and interested students
almost a year ago, when a need was
seen for trained personnel to heip
with drug abuse. A core group of
people, headed by Rev, Dwinell,
who is now the president of the
board of directors of the corpora-
tion, decided that a community
problem center was needed and not
simply a drug center involving pri-
marily university students, Some in-
spiration and training was provided
by a similar Roanoke program call-
ed TRUST.

REACH-OUT has been funded by
private donations so far, but at-
tempts are now being made to ac-
quire a state grant through the
Rockbridge Area Drug Council,
which coordinates all drug abuse ef-
forts in this area. The house on
North Main Street was donated by
V.M.I. and is being renovated pres-
ently.

About 50 volunteer workers have
completed the rigorous 36 hour
training program. Applicants were
screened both before and after the
training cycle. Included were ses-
sions on counseling, human rela-
tions, and drug abuse treatment with
doctors, psychologists, social work-
ers, and lawyers. Dr. Charles Hol-
land from Hollins College handled
sessions on primary relations, while
Rev. Dwinell explained general
counseling techniques. Tim Rodeli
from the TRUST program gave
talks on drug abuse, and Bill Hoff-
man from the Roanoke Total Action
Against Poverty group presented the
sessions on community relations,
Finally role plays dramatizing typi-
cal situations were used during some
sessions, The trainees met four

nights per week for two weeks.

So if you have a problem give
REACH-OUT a call any time of the
night or day. (463-7301).

fortunately little experience in deal-

til now generally refused to put
much faith in plots. Nor have |
ever relished those individuals who

For truly I do see a plot at hand and
it is the duty of those connoisseurs

Now perhaps you are becoming

However, surely you must realize

the heat is now on

Nevertheless | feel it is my duty
to now expose the plot. Though not

I have alluded to above.

And so with teeth bared but trem-

BY MONTY COTTIER

‘The wage-price freeze lately in-
stituted by our President (and re-
member if you can’t say anything
nice . . .), While it was originally
couched in terms of a polite request
that later hardened and toughened
into a rocky consistency faster than
a Chevrolet executive's face when
he found himself accidentally at a
Ralph Nader testimonial dinner, has
apparently had a little trouble infil-
trating down to the grass-roots level.

somewhat, for a variety of reasons.
To begin, it is the first word we have
ever written about the wage-price
freeze. We wanted to be known as
the only hack-writer in America who
hadn't waxed satirical on the sub-
ject.

right with me, what the h--I are you
kicking about?), presupposes that
this thing will be printed while the
freeze is still on. It would be a good
joke on me if they held it back until
the spring of 1973, by which time
various pundits have predicted that
there will be no economy at all,
much less a wage-price freeze; and
there T'll be, hopelessly out of date.

But if we must go ahead and talk
about the freeze (and, after writing
this much, I guess it’s really too late
to back out now), it might be inter-
esting to see just what effect the
Nixon Paralysis has had locally.

It should, by now, come as no
great shock to most of the members
of the W&L academic community
(many of whom haven't had a good
jolt since the revelation that the
1958 Entertainment Committee was
considering replacing the costly party
concoction known as Grain Punch

Rebuttal by Ford

To the Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

From the administration and
others involved, | was given the im-
pression that nothing would be said
about the incident involving Johnny
White and myself leaving the foot-
ball squad; therefore, | declined
comment on the matter. Now, it
seems, that impression was false due
to Coach Buck Leslie’s statements
in the last Ring-tum Phi.

As far as the reference to not in-

forming me as to the time of sum-
mer practice because he (Coach Les-
lie) did not know of my intent to
play football, I believe that is a false
statement,

I had never heard of W&L until
my high school football coach in-
formed me of a recruitment meeting
held at my school by Dick Szlasa,
who was then offensive line coach of
the football team. I attended that
meeting and definitely spoke of my
desire to play football,

After being accepted at W&L, |
came to the school and spoke with
Coach Leslie who told me that the
team needed help in the line, a pos-
sible reason why | was converted to
a defensive end last season.

it is standard procedure for high
school coaches to provide player
evaluations to college coaches for
their prospective college players.
This was done by my coach at City.

Blows Against The Empire

BY W. PATRICK HINELY

Last Friday night. as anyone within
earshot could tell, there was a big
event in the quad. Earshot in this case
would include most of Rockbridge
County, | am sure. Yeah, well, it
just happens once a year .. . why not
whoop it up a little?

What happened in the quad last
Friday night, under federal law, re-
sults in charges the same as those levi-
ed against the Chicago Eight. You're
just lucky John Mitchell was a frat
man. Think about that one,
“straights.”

I cannot speak to critically of the
fraternity system which sponsored
last Friday's performance without ap-
pearing to be a hypocrite, (which
many would assert anyway), because
| myself affiliate with a house. If
someone was judging the system on
last Friday's merits, | would indeed
be ashamed to admit that | am a part
of such a group. | do feel justified
enough to say that what happened
was disgusting.

What happened right here at WAL
was much more disgusting than what
happened in Chicago in 1968, or Paris
in 1970, or any other number of cases
which might be cited. At least the
“bums” in the streets are doing what
they are with a meaningful purpose
in mind. All you “straights”’—and I
saw a lot of you out there—think
about this: What you did was worse
than what Jerry Rubin does for a
living!

Of course, you can shrink behind

Draft Number

The Selective Service System an
nounced on Tuesday, October § that
Random Sequence Number 125
would be the ceiling for induction
into the military for young men in
the 1971 first priority selection
group—that is, those registrants born
in 1951 of earlier who received lot
tery numbers in 1970 of 1969 and
are available for induction during
1971

The Department of Defense an
nounced a 10,000 draft call for the
remainder of 1971. Draft Director
Dr. Curtis W. Tarr said that Selec
tive Service local boards would de
liver 6.500 of these men in the per
November 1-18 and the fe
maining 1.500 in the period Novem
ber 29-Decemebr 9. Tarr said that
he has directed local boards to give
at least

ind

10 days notice to all regis
trants facing the induction process in
coming months. Current draft regu
lations require 10 days notice

Tarr sant that the uniform fa

several defenses: at least you had the
decency to do it on private property,
it's all in fun, it’s a tradition, at least
it wasn’t a bunch of long-hairs out to
make trouble, and so on. The excuses
are endless.

The face remains that the behavior
exhibited by a great majority of the
mob in that quad was not unlike that
of apes. Or perhaps I do injustice to
the apes, who can plead the innocence
of being animals anyway. A more ac-
curate comparison should be to PRI-
MITIVE humans.

The mentality which encourages
this kind of periodic letting off of
steam to celebrate events with the
magnitude of the end of rush has
manifested itself today in a group of
people known as “rednecks.” The pri-
mary characteristic of this type of per-
son is that while their bodies have
reached adulthood, their minds have
not. This is on the assumption that
they even have minds, which I often
consider doubtful. Their five o'clock
whistles are only recess bells. Remem-
ber “play period” way back in ele-
mentary school?

I was indeed fortunate to have the
vantage point of a second-floor win-
dow to watch the circus. In case you
wondered who the devil kept taking
pictures, it was me. My thanks to you
who were there for being such inter-
esting subjects. Thanks also to who-
ever threw that rock through the
window about four inches from my
head; it added a little excitement to
an otherwise boring evening. | am

1971 group who is 1-A and qualified
with a RSN of 125 and below that
he will receive an induction notice in
the near future. Tarr pointed out
that some of these men will enter
the Army in January, February or
March of next year because of the
extended liability provisions of the
Selective Service regulations

“Equity of treatment for all regis
trants requires that all men with
RSNs of 125 of lower face the in
duction process.” Tarr said

only glad that such a W&L gentle-
man had the sense not to throw a
rock carelessly; I am sure he aimed it
right at that one windowpane so that
all it would do is add another sound
effect to the living movie he was act-
ing in. | know he wouldn't have
thrown it if he thought it might hurt
someone.

When I showed some of the pic-
tures to a friend of mine from another
school, a school without fraternities,
and thus hopefully a less biased judg-
ment of the fraternity slystem, his
comment was that if | cropped the
dorm out of the edge of the shots and
put police uniforms on a few of the
subjects, | could make a lot of money
selling them as real live riot pictures!
Who needs violence?

I could only agree.

Basically, I just don't see how it
was humanly possible for the coach
to not know I wanted to play foot-
ball at Washington and Lee.

I would also like to state that not
making the Towson State game was
not my reason for quitting. Johnny
and I had talked to Coach Leslie the
Tuesday before that game and com-
plained, for the last time, about the
unfair practices we had been receiv-
ing. The Coach gave me the impres-
sion that something would be done.
When I finished Thursday's prac-
tice—I have biology lab on Wednes-
day—I saw that nothing had been
done; therefore, I decided to leave.
It just so happens that the traveling
list is posted after Thursday's prac-
tice (sometimes it's posted on Fri-
day).

The only questions I have for
Coach Leslie, in regards to race, are
why, if not for color, was I “weed-
ed” out of practice and why was
Johnny not taught his new position?
Also, why did he say that “some of
his best friends” were of my race:
what's sometimes referred to as a
standard line?

Honor System Riddles
To the Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

I'm really confused. | came to
Washington and Lee completely as-
sured that the Honor System works.
Two weeks ago my bicycle got a flat
tire. | put it into the dorm until |
could get at it to repair it. Someone
promptly stole my tire and broke my
gears.

Today | went to check my bike
once more. | had already moved it
to the basement to protect it from
the “townies” that everyone tells me
messed it up. The other tire had a
tack driven into it. Whoever did it,
I'm sorry he wasted his time like
that. | hope he's sorry, too.

W&L Offense Fails To Move Piggy
As Hampden-Sydney Wins 16-3

The Washington and Lee Gen-
erals once again bit the dust Satur-
day afternoon the Blue took on the
undefeated, untied, and unscored
upon Hampden-Sydney Tigers be-
fore a homecoming crowd of sev-
eral hundred. The 16-3 score did
not really indicate how the game
went as the Generals dropped their
third straight game this season,

Hampden-Sydney took the open-
ing kickoff but was unable to move.
On fourth down, and one yard to go,
the Tigers punted to the WAL 31
where Dave Brooks made a_ fair
catch. Steve Fluharty went in to
guide the Generals and on the first
play from scrimmage he went
around end for eight yards, On the
following play Jim Farrar picked up
a first down on a four yard plunge
up the middle, Farrar and JoJo Mar-
tin then combined their efforts on
the next two downs for a couple of
five yard gains and another first
down. With the ball on the Tiger 47
the Blue was only able to gain six
yards in three plays and Chappy
Conrad dropped back to punt, Con-
rad came through, as he has all sea-
son, punting to the Hampden-Sydney
one yard line where a Tiger returned
it two yards to the three.

Bobby Long went in to guide the
liger offense but was unsuccessful
as the Blue defense once again held
their ground. Jay Fulcher did a
great job dropping Long for losses
of five and six yards. Marshall
Washburn also intercepted a Long
pass (pardon the pun) but it was
nullified on an offside penalty
against the Blue, On fourth down,
nine yards to go, from their own
five, the Tigers elected to punt, It

was a short kick of only 33 yards
and Washburn returned the ball
two yards to the Hampden-Sydney
36.

Once again, the Blue offense came
in to see if they could get some-
thing going. They moved down to
the Tiger 21 after an interference
penalty on third down. From there,
the Generals were able to move only
two yards in three plays and on
fourth down Coach Leslie sent in
Doug Chase to attempt a field goal.
Chase made good on the 36 yard
try and W&L went ahead 3-0, This
was the first time the Tigers had
been scored upon all season.

Both teams exchanged the ball on
punts and turnovers without having
any success until mid-way in the
second period when Hampden-Syd-
ney had the ball on their own 14
yard line following a Conrad punt.
On the first play from scrimmage
the Blue defensive unit made its only
bad mistake of the game when it
allowed Owens to sweep right end
for 75 yards before being hauled
down on the General 11, The Tigers
moved to the one on an_ interfer-
ence penalty and Owens took it in
from there. The extra point was
good and Hampden-Sydney now
led by a 7-3 margin with 7:16 left
in the half. There was no more scor-
ing in the rest of the first half.

Hampden-Sydney kicked off in the
second half and Martin returned it
to the W&L 24, From there Flu-
harty moved the Blue down to the
liger 25, the big play in the drive
coming on a 28 yard pass play to
Conrad on third down. However, the
offense was unable to move as the
Tiger defense stiffened for four plays

and regained — possession at that
point,

Neither team was able to move
until late.in the third.quarter when
Conrad dropped back to punt with
the ball on the General 17 yard
line. The snap went over his head
and into the end zone for a safety.
This meant that the Generals would
have to kick it away from their own
twenty. with the score now. 9-3, Con-
rad punted down to the Tiger 40
where Richmond returned it 47
yards to the Blue 13 for the Tigers.
Five plays later Owens took it over
from three yards out to put the Tig-
ers in front by a score of 15-3. Page
added the extra point and with 14:40
left in the fourth quarter it was 16-3.

W&L took possession on their
own 24 following the kickoff. Flu-
harty then took the team down the
field to a first and ten at the Tiger
11. The big play in the drive came
on a 38 yard pass from Fluharty to
Mark Lane. On the first play at the
11 Fluharty’s pass was intercepted
at the Tiger four. Neither team scor-
ed the rest of the game as the final
score was 16-3 in favor of Hamp-
den-Sydney.

Next week the Generals will take
on Bucknell at home in what pro-

mises to be a tough game. Div. |

WGL Ruggers
Fall Short
A gaimst ODU

The W&L ruggers again fell vic-
tim to their second-half jinx, as they
fell to Old Dominion at Norfolk
Saturday. The Blue arrived in Nor-
folk with a mere sixteen men, as a
number of usual starters were un-
able to make the game, illness or
conflicting activity prevailing. They
were replaced by six inexperienced
players from this fall’s recruits. -
three of those six in the crux of the
offense, the backfield.

Sull, at the half, Old Dominion

held only a narrow 6-0 lead. But ,

with the start of the second half,
ODU scored a couple of quick trys
and kept moving from there, until
the final whistle sounded their vic-
tory, 30-3.

The Blue’s troubles came with an
Old Dominion change of strategy,
initiated by the temporary absence
from the game of one of the W&L
ruggers, due to a cut above the eye.
While the Blue were playing one
man short with 14 men, ODU mov-
ed one man out of the serum and
into the backfield, crippling the
Blue offense and pressuring the de-
fense.

Fred Fletcher scored the only
W&L points with a successful pen-
alty kick for goal. The scrum did
an outstanding job, notably Truta
and Sandy. Fred Fletcher did an all
around outstanding job, Bill Ander-
son at hooker and Larry Cohen at
scrum-half also performed well for
the Blue.

The Blue go against Hampden-
Sydney at Sweetbriar on the 17th,
returning to Alumni Field to face
U.Va. on the 24th,

Lacrosse Practice Opens Next Week

The W&L lacrosse program gets
under way with fall practice start-
ing next week Tuesday and intra-
mural lacrosse organizing this week.
Lacrosse coack Dick Szlasa stressed
that the intramural program is open
to all students who have not played
for the varsity. “We want everyone
on campus to feel like they can play

lacrosse”, said coach Szlasa.

The IM program will lead up to
the JV program. Szlasa hopes that
even though a student dees not go
into the JV program, they will know
more about the game and will appre-
ciate it more as a spectator.

Fall practice for the varsity will
be highlighted by a scrimmage
against Roanoke on Nov. 20. It will
allow players to experiment at differ-
ent positions and give the coaches a

look at the freshmen and transfer
students.

Coach Szlasa expressed disappoint-
ment with a number of freshmen
recruited to play lacrosse, but feels
that their overall ability is excellent.
Five seniors and 12 juniors will be
returning from last year’s squad,
having lost only 3 through gradua-
tion, Szlasa enumerated the team’s

goals for this year. “First of all, we
want to win the conference title out-
right. Second, we want a berth in
the NCAA playoffs. We have to beat
either Virginia or Navy.”

“Last year we depended on Vir-
ginia to get us in the playoffs, This
year, we have to do it ourselves.”
The W&L lacrosse team was ranked

in the top ten last season. The squad
was ranked as the nation’s best col-
lege division eleven, With most of the
team returning this year the chances
of retaining the conference title are
bright.

l.aRue’s Pressbox

BY BOB “LASH” LARUE

Kicking the ball around the odd
zone while collecting my eager
money ... although Buck Leslie
would have cherished a win over
Hampden-Sydney last Saturday,
many consider the three points scor-
ed on the Tigers something of a vic-
tory in itself . . . the Generals field
goal was the first points scored on
Hampden-Sydney this season in four
games ... And while we're on the
subject of points, never has any team
run up so many on one of Darrell
Royal’s Texas squads as did Okla-
homa in the Sooners 48-27 romp
Ironically, while Oklahoma
showed its superiority, the team may
not even reach a bowl game, since
the Big Red must face top-ranked
Nebraska and number five Colorado
just to win the Big Eight Conference
title . . . Meanwhile, the Longhorns
will probably walk into the Cotton
Bowl again this year as the South-
west Conference's representative . . .
It’s this writer’s opinion that Wash-
ington and Lee Athletic Director Bill
McHenry came across extremely
well this past weekend during the
several talk sessions with visiting
alumni. , . Overheard comments in-
dicated that the alumni were favor-
ably impressed . . . While few alumni
these days now argue against Wash-
ington and Lee’s non-subsidization

program for intercollegiate athletics,
some still question W&L’s 1954 de-
cision . . . Anyhow, McHenry was
very convincing in his defense of
non-subsidized athletics . . . While
my heart is with the Pirates, my
money is on the Birds .. . Earlier I
felt the Buccos could extend the
World Series to seven games, but
the fabled Pittsburgh Pirates hitting
has faltered, and the pitching, ade-
quate at best, has collapsed .. . It
seems that the 1971 October Classic
adds more strength to the maxim
that good pitching will always han-
dle good hitting .. . And the rainout
Sunday which forces the cancellation
of a day of travel from Baltimore to
Pittsburgh is definitely to the Oriole’s
advantage, since the Pirates need
the time to allow their meager hill
corps to rest up... . Don’t count the
Bucs out in four games; make it
Baltimore in five, at the outside six
. . . Incidentally, this is the twenty-
fifth World Series to be televised . . .
I'm still worked up about that Big
Eight showdown . . . Should Okla-
at Thanksgiving . . . Should Okla-
homa beat Colorado this week, and
if both the Sooners and Nebraska
remain undefeated until their meet-
ing in Norman, that Turkey Day
confrontation may determine not
only the conference title but also the
national championship.

Policy on Admissions Reflects
Dim State of Today’s Economy

(Continued from page 2)

is not one of extremes (i.e. very rich
and very poor), rather one some-
where in the middle. This state re-
volves around the critical decisions
made by admissions people: whether
to give a larger sum of money to
one student or smaller sums to a
number of students. It is the most
difficult of all the decisions faced It
does little good for the University or
the applicant if the school can only
provide a portion of what a student
needs to attend the school, The ap-
plicant would be forced to attend
another school where his financial
needs are met or afe not as great.

On the other hand, if the Univer-
sity were to agree to meet the needs
of a student with great need, it
would) mean a concentration of
funds in one area and maybe mean
that a number of students with jesser
needs would be deprived of help.
“Individual decisions, subjective de-
cisions, have to be made,” says Dean
Noell, “and they are not easy.”

Although they can never help all
the people they would like to help,
admissions people are pleased with
the calibre of student they have
been able to attract. In fact, Dean
Farrar remains “very heartened”
about W&L’s showing last year. The
number of applicants has continued
to rise (total of 1260 for 1971). Also,
there has been a slight rise in aver-
age S.A.T. scores over the scores of
previous classes. (Verbal-575; Math-
615).

Dean Farrar does not perceive
any great differences, but believes
that “the calibre of students this year
appears a little stronger than last
year's.” He terms this “very encour
aging” at a time when the majority
of small, private institutions are ex-
periencing problems and even hav-
ing to compromise. Many of them
choose, because of financial reali-
ties, to go coed, hoping to capitalize
on the present trend in college edu
cation. W&L’s position, although not

as financially confident as it used to
be (as is the case with virtually all
institutions) is not in any real seri-
ous trouble, either. That is, the Uni-
versity although it is always study-
ing the possibility, has “no present
plans to go coed”, according to Dean
Farrar. No great expansion of the
exchange program which brings 23
females from surrounding schools to
the predominately male W&L cam-
pus is anticipated.

The University will continue, then,
along its present path of trying to
reach geographic, economic, and
social cross sections of the nation
within the limitations imposed by
an all male population and, more
exactly, within the limits dictated by
its financial aid pocketbook. Recruit-
ment at local high schools by the
S.R.C. and at schools across the na-
tion will continue with the intention
still that of attracting quality stu-
dents to quality education,

Sha-Na-Na Coming

For February Concert

Headliners for W&L’s first three
concerts have been announced by
the University Dance Board, with
the promise of at least two more
concerts to follow suit,

Homecoming weekend will pro-
vide the scenario for the first con-
cert of the year when the exciting
Chambers Brothers come to Lexing-
ton. The concert has been set for
Saturday night, October 23, in the
old section of Doremus Gym. All
subsequent concerts will be held in
the new section. Tickets may be pur-
chased at the door for the 8 p.m.
performance at $5 per person. Dance
plans for the entire season will be
available in the Co-op at $40 until
Friday, October 22.

Gordon Lightfoot will be on hand
in a Nov. 20 concert, followed by
the return engagement of Sha-Na-Na
on Feb. 12. The most popular attrac-
tion to hit W&L for years with their
concert last year, Sha-Na-Na will
share the bill with one of the leg-
ends of yesteryear they re-create,
probably Bo Diddley.

Additional concerts are planned
for the first or second weekend in
March and the first, in May.

with a much more economical, and
equally devastating, brew derived
from reconstituted orange drink and
a good, healthy dose of Sterno) that
prices in the Co-op have risen mark-
edly, in some cases by as much as
100 per cent.

Even though, on the surface, the
fact that the price increases went
through on August 3 should absolve
those concerned from all guilt, we
find that the coincidence of timing in
this matter is simply too great to be
mere coincidence (did you get that,
or must we go through it again?).

Further, it goes without saying
(although, due to a lack of anything
else to fill the space, I'm going to say
it anyway) that W&L is no longer
the rich boy's school it once was.
Can we silently endure the piteous
spectacle of countless student, many
of them from deprived backgrounds,
falling victim daily to advanced cata-
tonia in classrooms all across the
campus, simply because the life- and
face-saving grace of hot coffee (from
five cents to ten cents), hot tea (like-
wise) or iced coffee (from 16 to 21
cents) have been priced beyond their
reach? There are laws governing
public menaces such as diptheria
carriers, purse-snatchers, and Bad
Men who make dishonest livings off
the savings of widows and orphans;
shall this new plunge go untrammel-
ed? (f seem to be asking an awful
lot of questions. Don't bother an-
swering themb, please).

To return to that remarkable exer-
sise in forecasting by which the price
increase in the Co-op preceeded the
freeze by a scant 12 days (one of
the benefits of writing a column like

this is that one need not necessarily
make a fetish out of literary organi-
zation), considering the vast mone-
tary sums involved, it is too much to
ask for an investigation into the poli-
tical connections and considerations
enjoyed by the staff and manage-
ment of the Co-op? While it is true
that Harding’s administration was
destroyed by some scandal or other,
and Grant's chicaneries finally ruin-
ed his health and forced him to
write interminable memoirs (I'm
working entirely without references
or notes on this, so I feel that a little
laxity in the matter of historical data
can be overlooked. There is such a
thing as useless pedantry, you know),

Intramural Football

BY RAY SWAN

Intramural football climaxes next
week with two division races still un-
decided. In division 1, the PiKAs
must beat the Law School tomorrow
and then win the rest of their games.
The Sigma Chis must do the same
against the Delts in Division 3, Divi-
sions 2 and 4 are pretty well wrap-
ped up by the Phi Delts and Phi
Gams, the only two undefeated
teams.

The present division leaders are
favored to hold onto their positions
until the playoffs. After that, any-
thing can happen, but I'll go with
the Phi Delts and Phi Gams in the
divisional playoffs.

For the championship, the Phi
Delts seem to have the edge, especi-
ally in the backfield. The Phi Gam
line relies on strength to penetrate
and will have to depend more on
speed to contain the Phi Delt backs,
led by QB Charles Comly.

Calls For Research On War

(Continued from page 1)
indirectly caused by the war. In
Vietnam thus far. there have been
about 1,500,000 listed casualties,
while the indirect death toll has risen
above the 3,000,000 mark.

Here the guest speaker, using
World War II and the Vietnam War
as examples, separated all-out wars
from those of a limited basis. “A
limited war (such as Vietnam) is
limited in its means .. . the nations
do not use all effective means at
their disposals.” He cited unlimited
submarine warfare, genocide, and
the dropping of the atom bomb
at Hiroshima as examples of all-out
warfare. Dr. Duetsch also suggested
that wars are generally limited in
their means, as well as their aims,
among nations of equal strength,
while wars between imbalanced pow-
ers are generally all-out. He gloom-
ily theorized that if we ever do have
an all-out war between major pow-
ers at the present level of military
armament, “there is a good chance
that we will never have another one
.. . there is a good chance that it
would be the last.”

In further research into the period
from 1816-1965. the professor ask-
ed, “Who initiated the wars? Did
the initiator win? After all, there's
not much rationality in starting a
war that you're going to lose.” In
the 1800's, he noted that 80 per cent
of the wars were won by the initia-
tors (whom he defined as the gov-
ernment who moved mass troops
and materials across an international
boundary with the purpose of re-
maining there).

However, Professor Deutsch then
pointed out that. since 1910. over
60 per cent of the wars have been
lost by the initiators. He cited that
a combination of less diplomatic

Statesmen, a more complicated
world, and the overburdening of
governments as compared to the
1800's was probably the major fac-
tor in this percentage drop.

He then probed the causes of war.

To begin with, the Harvard doctor
listed ten levels of the present world
social system, ranging from the in-
dividual to the United Nations, each
of which could commit an act in-
creasing the likelihood of war. Pro-
fessor Deutsch then suggested ten
steps towards war, the first being the
nature of an individual, and the last
being escalation as a result of an
international crisis. He noted that if
each of these steps could be diverted
away from the homing signal of
war, “we can make war less likely.”

He reasoned that war, like the
once-accepted practices of cannibal-
ism and slavery, can be wiped out,
implying that our thoughts and feel-
ings towards war can and will
change.

In conclusion, Dr. Deutsch stated
that. in our present world, “two
more headaches must go—mass pov-
erty and war.” He claimed mass
poverty'’s elimination as a distinct
possibility of the near future. “It can
be done tomorrow if we really
want.” He then alluded to a simi-
lar solution, through research, to
war, concluding, “we are living in
the greatest period of transforma-
tion ever. We must change this habit
of mankind (war) so that mankind
can live at all.”

+s AND THAT MEANS
You, 0!

    

still we must not shy away from dis-
covering the facts behind this matter.

However, perhaps it’s all for the
best. College, if it does nothing else,
should prepare us to take our place
in the outside world, and, in this day
of inflation, paying five cents for a
cup of coffee lends an aura of fan-
tasy to our everyday lives which is
as sinister as it is all-pervasive,

In this light, it is probably all for
the best that the prices have gone
up. There are few enough of the old
traditions around, and it is fitting
that nickle coffee has gone the way
of the beanie and the three-piece
suit. You can’t have your tie, and eat

Election Is Monday, Five Run For EC.

Duncan DeGraft
Exectutive Committee

Each year, the freshmen along
with the upperclassmen should, after
close analysis of the System and of
themselves, dedicate themselves to
the goals of the Honor System, If
everyone did commit themselves,
they would be abiding by the state-
ment: “A Washington and Lee stu-
dent is to conduct himself as a
gentleman in matters of honor at all
times; he is trusted and he assumes
the obligation to be trustworthy.”
This common goal of trust among
all Washington and Lee students is
a bond which not only gives respect
to the individual but also gives one
an ideal he may live by. Belief in
one’s fellow man is easier to achieve,
if all Washington and Lee students
are striving for the same ideal.

As a candidate for the Freshman
Representative to the Executive
Committee, I would, if elected, try
to unite the Freshman Class in order
to achieve the cherished goal of
trust among men. Trust can be
obtained from men of varied back-
grounds only if there is a common
purpose, Our purpose will be to
endorse the Honor Code.

The best way to endorse the
Honor Code is to vigorously put it
into use. Whether one is in the
cafeteria or in the classroom, the

ULC.

Bob Keatley

As newcomers to W&L, the fresh-
men may not fully understand the
workings of W&L or its student gov-
ernment, but there are a few things
that we, as freshmen, have already
noticed. I've had the opportunity to
talk with several people in the dorms
so far and I've been given some
ideas on what these people feel are
issues affecting freshmen.

One idea was that contract food
in Evans Dining Hall should be op-
tional after the fall term of the
freshman year. Another is to keep
the Supply Store and Co-op open
during the day on Saturday and on
Sunday afternoons. A third was to
not allow townspeople in the game
room of the University Center. The
University Center is for W&L stu-
dents and their guests-not for use as
a community recreation hall.

The freshman class should be
given a chance to meet their candi-
dates for office. I feel that an open
house one evening in the student
government office with all the candi-
dates present would give freshmen a
chance to come by and find out who
the candidates are.

These ideas are not necessarily
mine; but rather they are the ideas
of the freshmen I've had a chance to
talk with. If I'm elected, | plan to
do exactly the same thing-that is,
talk to you and find out what you
feel needs to be done. Its not my
voice that needs to be heard but the
voice of the freshman class.

Larry Lyles
The University Council, unlike
the Executive Committee. is not
familiar to the large majority of

Code should be in effect. Through
this active use, the individuals who
abide by the code will gain the
respect of his fellow classmates.
Respect will be the main theme
uniting freshmen to themselves and
to the rest of the college community.

Tav Lupton

Of primary importance to the Exe-
cutive Committee is the role of the
Honor Code. I believe the Code
should be responsive to the student
body and, in return, be actively sup-
ported by the students. The success
or failure of the Honor Code rests
with each individual student's will-
ingness to make it work,

In view of this, then, the E.C.
should, in hearing an honor trial,
consider the intent of the individual
as to whether a possible violation
was committed maliciously or not,
and any or all mitigating circum-
stances should be taken into con-
sideration, As the freshman repre-
sentative, I would keep these
thoughts in mind.

However, the Honor Code is not
the sole function of the E.C.; the
Committee oversees all forms of stu-
dent government. I will be working
for the best interests of the freshman
class in all matters such as curri-
culum changes, dormitory regula-
tions, and any change in student
government. As an elected freshman

representative, [| will have consider-
able influence with the administra-
tion officials concerning any wishes
or recommendations of the freshman
class.

As for a list of promises, I can’t
give you one. If elected, | am only
one member of a council of twelve
people and must accept any decision
made by a majority of that group.
What | can promise is that I am
willing to devote all the time neces-
sary to do the best job I possibly
can in representing the freshman
class.

Paul Malin
Candidate for EC Representative

Student government is playing an
increasingly stronger role in student
affairs. Ten years ago parietals were
dictated by the school administra-
tion. Last week a composite com-
mittee voted on W&L parietals. We
as W&L freshmen are reaping the
benefits of years of progress in stu-
dent government.

W&L student government has two
major branches — the Executive
Committee and the University Coun-
cil, All campus activities and pos-
sible violations are under the juris-
diction of the Executive Committee.
Formed last year, the University
Council decides university policies.
As a member of the U. C., students
have a direct voice and vote in

eat Contested

WA&L students. The chief reason for
this is that it is a new body, con-
ceived only last year.

The Council serves as the highest
authority over all student affairs, ex-
cept the honor system and curricular
matters. It is responsible for the
regulation of student and fraternity
conduct, F.C. activities, and dormi-
tory rules.

Probably the issue of greatest in-
terest to Freshmen is that of parie-
tals. Recently, the Council voted
only to extend parietal guidelines
rather than abolish them. This action
has made even more obvious the
uselessness of retaining rarely en-
forced rules. If a dorm section votes
to have full parietals, the week-end
restrictions—noon Friday to mid-
night Sunday, with no overnight
visitation—are virtually impossible
to enforce. The clause concerning
overnight visitation is certainly on
the books for appearance only. and
should be abolished. (The same
argument might be applied to week-
day restrictions, but further consid-
eration is in order before these are
cast aside.)

Another regulation which will be-
come of interest to many Freshmen
is that requiring fraternities to re-
tain housemothers. This is another
“appearance only” rule, and in most
cases. the housemothers constitute
an unnecessary financial burden.
Space limitations prohibit discussion
of other important matters, but it is
within the scope of the Council's
power to effect many needed
changes. Concerned students need to
let their representative know their
opinions so that he can represent
them both responsively and respon-
sibly.

Andy Mehaffey

We are all aware of the bitter
confrontations between students and
faculty in universities all around the
country concerning the right of the
students to govern themselves and
have a say in formulating university
policies. I feel that the only efficient
and sensible way to express dis-
satisfaction and bring about con-
structive change is to work within
the framework of the university. We
here at Washington and Lee are
fortunate in that our school has
given us a good framework for
change in which to operate; this is
the University Council. One of the
great problems of any very old uni-
versity is that of tradition. Tradition
has always been very strong at
Washington and Lee as well it
should be, for we have a_ great
heritage at this university. However
we must be careful not to let tradi-
tion become our master. The tradi-
tions must be adapted to ever chang-
ing customs in order to maintain
their relevancy. | feel that the Uni-
versity Council is vital in bringing
about constructive change while up-
holding the great traditions and
heritage of WashingtOn and Lee. It
is you the students of Washington
and Lee that are even now con-
tributing to the heritage of this
institution, and your most direct
path towards a meaningful contri-
bution is your University Council.
As freshman candidate for the Uni-
versity Council, I should like very
much to be the voice of the fresh-
man class in shaping the heritage of
Washington and Lee, and I will
always try to be available to hear
your suggestions and complaints.

Four Seeking Vice-Presidency

Tom Lancaster

The freshman of WA&L look upon
this election and student govern-
ment as a whole from many view-
points. To many, this campaign
means they don't want the endiess
number of posters cluttering their
dorm halls. To others, those who
would really like to put the best man
in office, the myriad names and
faces only confuse maters. Probably
few truly know enough of what is
going on to make a wise choice or a
sound opinion, Furthermore, the of-
fices themselves, and their respon-
sibilities, are even more vague. Tm
not claiming to be any different. I
am running because | would like to
get involved and find out from the
inside, what is happening in our stu-
dent government. This means my
winning the election. My only pro-
mise is total involvement, not solely
in upholding the responsibilities of
the Vice-Presidency, but in repre-
senting the opinions of all freshman
| would appreciate your vote.

Bill Lassetter

Because I feel that | can make a
substantial, worthwhile contribution
to class government, | have become
a eandidate for the office of Vice
President of the Freshman Class
Teo often the duties of Vice-Presi
dent are ignored because they are
considered unimportant. | hope to
make full use of the powers of this

office to benefit both the Freshman
class and the university as a whole.

Specifically, | am opposed to the
collection of exorbitant class dues
when little explanation of their in-
tended use is given. | intend, if elect-
ed, to put the good of the university
above the good of the class, and
will strive to encourage active par
ticipation of freshmen in all politi-
cal areas, inside as well as outside
the influence o [this school.

| would appreciate your support
in these endeavors.

Bill Lassetter
David Rigby
lo the freshman class:

Many Washington and Lee fresh-
man are faced with a new and chal-
lenging situation here. There are
several aspects of college living
which are different from high school

our lives not only for today, but
also for the future

Duke Stevens

fo the Washington & Lee freshman
class:
Up until this time, there has been
a lack of unity in the freshman class.
This is due primarily to the lack of
leadership. True, we have not had
anyone in power to this date, bui we
are about to settle this deficit. 1 feel
thai with my pasi exposure to stu-
dent government and my strong feel-
ings toward having a supreme gradu-
ating class. | can. and will. do a
good job in the position of vice
president
I realize. also. that there has
been a lack in the upholding of the
Honor Code. Every student that ix
admitted info this institution knows

about the Washingion and Lee
Honor Sysiem. We are only one
month into the «school vear. and
numerous thefis have already oc
cured. |, myself. have had a vers
expensive Watch <iolen from ay

policy issues such as parietals. The
recent formation of the U.C. ex-
emplifies increasing student control
of W&L’s future.

In the first U. C. meeting, the stu-
dents and administration voted with
few exceptions in blocks. When
future issues come up, I foresee that
these lines between student and fac-
ulty will fall. When this happens,
the student government will not be
fighting the “system” but exerting
its will through it. To accomplish
this we must elect to all government
positions men who will work toward
this as a goal.

I want to be a part of our
progressive system of government.
I am seeking the E.C. post in order
to become a constructive part of the
WAL student government. I will up-
hold the Honor System and strive
to keep it strong. By doing this I
hope to contribute to the overall
strength of the student government.
| am coming by this week to talk
with each freshman and look for-
ward to hearing your ideas on stu-
dent government.

Will Scott
Freshman Representative to E.C.

I have three reasons for running:
1) to help represent the views of the
freshman class honestly, 2) to have
a direct say in the decisions made
while we are at W&L. 3) to serve
the freshman class as it deserves to
be served.

Upon my election [I will fulfill six
objectives: a) the upholding of the
Honor Code at it is at W&L, b) to
give the frosh a clear, distinct, and
intelligent voice to the rest of the
community and be a strong sounding
beard for their ideas, more specific-
ally, c) | endorse the concept be-
hind Lewis Powell's resolution
abolishing parietals, but understand

the bind this would put on President
Huntley and many fund raisers, d)
| support the maintainance of a
strong fraternity system and at the
same time will insure that the inde-
pendent’s life can be meaningful,
productive, and enjoyable, e) I will
investigate the rule concerning
“townies” on campus and the en-
forcement measures used, and very
importantly, f) I support the Student
Association of Black Unity, because
it is from this organization that
“Black Power” will be supplied with
brainpower.

Certainly my leadership qualifica-
tions, 1) Past President of the Rich-
mond area Teenage Republicans, 2)
Past President of the Brotherhood
of St. Andrew's, 3) pledge of Phi
Kappa Sigma fraternity, and 4) the
fact that | am serving my country
via ROTC (of course my draft
number is 25) gives me as good
qualifications as anyone else.

I do want to serve and I would
like to win. Thank you, very much.

Will Scott

Barney Skelton
The idea of listing specific cam-
paign promises rather turns me off,
so you won't hear any. | will,

though, tell you what to expect, in
general terms, if you do elect me to
the Executive Committee.

You can expect me to be first and
foremost, an advocate for the Fresh-
man class in the general affairs of
the school. I don't believe that I
am the only one who is tired of
hearing a number of subtle, but de-
finitely impugning remarks concern-
ing our class. I address this griev-
ance particularly to the crack edi-
torial staff of the Ring-tum Phi, who
seem to delight in sniping at us
weekly about one trivality or an-
other. They observe with disdain
that some of us err from traditional
dress. They seem to think that we
have it too easy, now that we can
more or less choose our own courses,
In general, it seems that we are sim-
ply not up to par.

Obviously, we are “up to par.” In
fact we are as strong or stronger
than any class that has ever been
here. We believe in Washington and
Lee, its Honor Code and its tradi-
tions just as much as any class has.

If you wish to have a person serv-
ing you on the E.C. who is for the
Freshman class, for the Honor Sys-
tem, but most importantly, for
Washington and Lee, | would ap-
preciate your vote.

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, OCTOBER 14, 1971

President To Be Elected

Bill Biesel

My name is Bill Biesel. | am a
candidate for Freshman Class Presi-
dent, an office which carries with it
not only administrative responsibili-
ties but social responsibilities as well.
The President becomes a member of
the Student Control Committee and
also assumes a place on the Planning
and Development Committee. From
the social viewpoint he is in charge
of one of the big weekends and is
on the University Dance Board.
Now in this capacity, | would be in
a position to support existing regula-
tions, but also, and more important-
ly, to change them or institute new
ones as necessary. A few proposals
I have in mind are installing a mail
box between the old and new Fresh-
man Dorms. and attempting to get
more hot water for the old dorm.
Realistically, though, | would have
little power other than that of influ-
ence, but with your votes behind me.
the chances of carrying oul any pro-
mises will be greater. Your support
is the key to the betterment of the
Class of ‘75. Remember me. Bill
Biesel.

Carl Cassidy

Next Monday, you will choose a
class president. In the past, his only
duty has been the supervision of the
Springs Weekend. The traditional
unimportance of the job reflects the
lack of emphasis placed on the class
as a body. People have tended to
identify exclusively with their fra-
ternity brothers rather than with
other members of the class. I would
like to see the class get together for
at least one party which could be
financed by a money-raising project
rather than out of your pockets.

if elected. | would represent the
class, not the administration. on
such questions as parictals. Most
students seem to desire unrestricted
visitation on weekends. | would sup-
port this and any other cause popu
lar to the members of the Class of
go.

Jeffrey Fischer

Without a doubt. the reason be-
hind my candidacy for Freshman
President is that | want to change
his image and function. In the past
years, his main responsibility has
been to run the Fancy Dress cock-
tail party. something | will continue

to do, in the tradition of great
WAL. erain parties.
However the age of the party

boy president is fading fast and to-
day's student leader must realize his
duty and right to help shape the
institution around him. This year
for the first time, the Freshman
President will sit on the Planning
and Development Committee. As the
role of the fraternities in housing
stidents decreases. this body be-
comes increasingly important in
planning new upperclass dorms, as
well as the new library and law
school
This is but one example of how
I plan to develop the office of presi-
dent into a meanineful and signifi
cant part of WAL government and
life

The powers and duties of the
President of the Freshman Class

I believe the Presidency can be-
come a meaningful and relevant
position with channels through
which Freshmen can voice approval
or disenchantment with University
policies affecting them. One such
program which I am sure Freshmen
would like to air their views on is
the planning of orientation. | would
like to form a committee to review
and improve the program for future
classes. | would also like to set up a
suggestion box where Freshmen
could let their opinions be known
and acted up.

If elected | would like to imple-
ment these and other changes which
would make the Freshman Class
Presidency a working office and not
just a status symbol.

Louis LeLaurin

John Keith

I propose to end the war in Viet-
nam, establish peace in the world,
and stop all poverty.

This platform is just as reason-
able as anyone's here because as
conditions at Washington and Lee
stand today any issue that suggests
change is rejected by the University
faculty.

Therefore | won't make promises
to abolish rules that the University
keeps primarily to look good on its
books.

| feel that our problems can not
even be discussed until the faculty
can be shown that we, the students,
have changed considerably in the
past few years. Then and only then
will there not be any University
blocks of changes that are needed
for our class.

With your support, | will take
the truth to the administration and
sincerely try to show them that poli-
cies can change as students change
without losing the high ideals that
Washington and Lee has possessed
for over a century.
