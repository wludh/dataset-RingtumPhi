Law School Officers Elected

EC Grants Appropriation To SBA

BY DICK AMRHINE
Facing a considerable amount of

new semester business, the Execu-
tive Committee convened this week
and decided unanimously to give

the Student Bar Association of the
Law School $437.50 ($1.75 per stu-
dent) to facilitate various Law
School needs.

Charlie Hofheimer, fall president
of the SBA spearheaded the discus-
sion as to whether or not these
funds would have to be shared with
the Law Review. The EC deter-
mined that a separate amount would
be alloted to the periodical. The re-
quest will be formally presented by
Lock Handley, Law School repre-
sentative on the EC, at a later date.

Also the EC announced the re-
sulis of the Law School Elections

held a week before the holidays.
Running for president of the win-
ter term were Tom Gosse, Pete
Wimbrow and Lawson Turner, with
lurner emerging victorious in a run-
off. The office of vice-president was
contested by Mac Squires and Jim
Stalnaker, with Squires winning.
Larry Croft ran unopposed for sec-
retary as did Ridge Porter for treas-
urer.

In other business Monday night,
the EC heard several committee re-
ports. Curriculum Committee
Chairman Roger Munsick present-
ed a number of ideas being studied
by his committee.

In exploring possibilities of
courses concerning other cultures,
the commitee conducted a poll the
results of which favored such

Former Secretary of the Interior
Stewart Udall and Tennessee Sena-
tor William E. Brock are among
the distinguished figures who will
participate in this year’s ‘Contact’
Symposium, to be held during the
first two weeks in February.

According to Roger Munsick and
Skip Paukert, co-chairmen of the
‘Contact’ Steering Committee, the
names of the other lecturers ap-
pearing throughout the program
will be revealed during the next
few weeks. “We are making a bold
departure from the essentially sin-

gle-theme programs of the past,”
said Paukert. “We feel that this
freedom has allowed us to create

a program of wide-ranging appeal.”

Mr. Udall will inaugurate the
‘Contact’ forum on Tuesday, Febru-
ary |, with an 8 p.m. talk in Lee
Chapel. His topic is expected to con-
cern environmental issues. An in-
formal seminar will be held with
Mr. Udail in the Student Center Li-
brary that afternoon.

Senator Brock will appear on
Thursday, February 3, with an ad-
dress at 3:30 p.m. in the Lee Cha-
pel. Following the Senator's speech,
there will be a reception for him
sponsored by the University Repub-
licans, also in the Student Center,
to which the public will be invited.

Senator Brock, whose narrow vic-
tory over incumbent Albert Gore
in 1970 heartened the Nixon Ad-
ministration, is a 1953 graduate of
the W&i. Commerce School. The
4i-year old Chattanooga native had
served in the United States Congress
for eight years before winning the
Senate seat.

Though the Republican Brock
generally voted along party
lines during his legislative career,
many liberals have applauded his
civic activities in his home city.

In one such effort Brock spear-
headed a literacy drive in Chat-
tanooga and personally taught
reading and writing to impoverish-

! blacks in the area.

Brock’s election battle was a fo-
cus of national attention two years

Administration target. Brock emer
eed victorious by about 42.000
votes. He serves on the Committee

for Banking. Housing and Urban
\llairs as well as on the Govern-
ment Operations Committee.
Stewart Udall served for eight
years as Secretary of the Interior in

the Kennedy and Johnson admini-
strations. He has since served as
Visiting Professor of Environmen-
tal Humanism at Yale and as Chair-
man of ‘Overview,’ an environmen-
tal consulting group for govern-
ments and industry.

Udall is a graduate of the Uni-
versity of Arizona. He practiced law
in his home state before serving
three terms in the U.S. House of
Representatives. He was appointed
to the Interior post in 1961.

As secretary, Udall was among
the early proponents of ‘the new
Conservation,” a long-range plan of
environmental protection. He also
participated in talks with former
USSR Chairman Khruschev in 1962
while on a tour of Russian hydro-
power facilities.

He is the author of two books,
“1976—Agenda for Tomorrow”
and “The Quiet Crisis.” Udall has
recently been prominent for his
vocal support of his son, who is a
draft evader exiled in Canada.

Letter Donated
To Archives

The Lee Archives contain the
most complete collection of ma-
terials and manuscripts relating to
the Lee family. Dr. Allen Moger,
Professor of History and head of
the archives notes that “dozens of
letters have been added to the Lee
Archives through the generosity of
people who prize them, but wanted
them to be in a safe place for the
sake of posterity.”

Dr. Moger also stressed the im-
portance of the way in which let-
ters are catalogued. Letters written
by Lee are catalogued under the
recipient's name, while those ad-
dressed to the Civil War leader are

grouped under the name of the
writer.

Three of the Lee family manu-
scripts have been presented to

Washington and Lee by Mrs. Stan-
ley Brown of Leesburg. Mrs. Brown
also donated a two page handwrit-
ten letter by Mary Custis Lee, writ-
ten in September, 1872, and a pass
signed by Lee when he was a cadet
adjutant at the United States Mili-
tary Academy in 1829.

Washington and Lee's policy is to offer financial assistance
to any admitted student who without assistance would be
unable to attend the University. No student who believes he is
qualified for admission should fail to apply because he lacks
financial resources.

The aid rendered by Washington and Lee may be a schol-
arship or a grant, a long-term educational loan, a part-time
job on campus, or a combination of any of these. Annually,
the University provides approximately $500,000 to more than
300 students and is seeking constantly to broaden its financial
aid programs.

—from the Washington and Lee University Bulletin

 

Recently the Student Recruitment Committee obtained a
grant of $20,000. The sum will be allocated to four students as
scholarships.

Over the brief period of two years the committee has done
quite a job, Several thousand dollars have been raised and
earmarked for minority group students. Also the group has
encouraged several youths to seek an education at W&L,
youths who might never have considered enrolling in our in-
Overall the Student Committee's
deeds have been quite successful and worthy of congratula-

stitution, Recruitment
tions. These students have scrambled for minority group stu-
dents and money to get these students through W&L.

Unfortunately, this scrambling, especially for money, has
hecome a necessity. The Comprehensive Tuition Fee is $2,200
a year. Next year the same fee is expected to rise even higher
to $2,300. With tuition increasing, and a basic scholarship
fund of half a million dollars, fewer men will get scholarships
or people currently on scholarship can anticipate a propor-
tionally devalued sum next year.

There is an alternative to this scholarship squeeze. Yale
University has developed a unique solution to this educa-
tional expense problem. Yale President, Kingman Brewster
Jr. hypothesized that, “Unless we use some ingenuity we must

either lower our quality or close our doors to those who

cannot pay the increased cost of quality.”

The Yale plan is basically GO TO SCHOOL NOW—
PAY LATER. The “Tuition Postponement Option” has been
labeled by the media as Pay as You Earn (PAY: incident-
ally is the accepted abbreviation).

The mechanics of the system are quite simple. .\ student
asks for a loan. The sum is repaid over a 35 year period, Un-
der the present setup, the repayment period is between five
and ten years at most colleges and universities. The alumnus,
however, does not pay back the amount borrowed. Instead, the
former student pays a fixed percentage of his yearly income.
The suggested rate for Yale was 4 per cent for every $1,000
borrowed. Here is an example of how it would work: a stu-
dent borrows $5,000 and earns $10,000 a vear, he would repay
$200 annually.

Under this system the amount eventually repaid would
vary greatly for the individual debtors. Doctors with high
salaries would pay a higher return than a modestly paid
social worker. Some would pay a great deal more back to the
college than was originally borrowed, and some individuals
would repay considerably less.

Limitations on this system of PAYE are secant. Graduate
students as well as undergraduates can take advantage of
the program. The original ceiling of a loan is $800, which
must be spent toward exclusively educational expenses, That
ceiling is expected to rise as soon as it is deemed feasible

Understandably, this new approach was quite a bomb
shell to college administrators nationwide, The basic concept
of scholarships was being altered some people claimed, The
cost of education is being placed on the beneficiaries, not the
parents of the student, or on the public in the case of state
supported schools, By assuring needy students that money
would be available, Yale has guaranteed qualified students a
right to attend. And as a corollary, the enrollment of minority
vroup students is predicted to jump,

Cite a few universities are awaiting the early outcome ol
this experiment, The Ford Foundation was impressed enough
with the plan's promise that $500,000 has been approved for
the study of Pay as You Earn loans nationwide,

It would be a truly tragic thing if W&L ever had to turn
away qualified men simply because scholarship money was
hort. The young men would suffer and certainly the Univer

sity would suffer, Such a situation does not exist, but is a

definite possibility. The Pay as You Earn plan should be con

a possible soln

BY GAIL DUDLEY

A man and his son are traveling
in a car together when they have a
bad accident. The man is killed,
and his son is critically injured. The
boy is rushed to the operating room
of the nearest hospital. Upon look-
ing at him, the surgeon says, “I
can't operate. This boy is my son.”

This anecdote puzzles even the
most enthusiastic women’s libera-
tion advocate. The irony, of course,
is that the surgeon is a woman.

It is apparent that there is a
difference between the aspirations

and achievements of most American
men and their female counterparts.
Do the surrounding women's col-

 

leges and this universiiy, supposedly
“separate but equal” educational in-
stitutions, enforce this discrepancy’
Perhaps some insight can be gained
through a comparison of two
schools——-WA&L and Hollins.

There are a few surface similari-
ties. Both schools are privately own-
ed liberal arts colleges. They are of
approximately the same size. Both
schools are unisex, Here the parallel
ends.

At Washington and Lee, there is
a much higher degree of professional
orientation. Por example, the Uni-
versity has both a school of com-
merce and a journalism school
There are more course offerings in
the sciences, economics and politics.

There is much greater emphasis
on the arts, English and Philosophy
at Hollins. The only business course
offered is one which “develops ac
curacy, rhythm, and speed in touch
typing; trains students to take
tation and to transcribe accurately
from shorthand notes: and teaches
office procedures, methods of filing,
and the preparation of business re

 

 

Separate But Equal?

  

coneert netted the biggest financial
gain ever for the board and even
surpassed the still talked about Sha-
Na-Na date of last season. With
the past concerts, the upcoming
Fancy Dress, and the future plans
in mind, Dance Board President.

Bert Meem says he anticipates a
year in

“good remainder of the

Hollins:

 

ports.” Hollins also offers educa-
tion courses; W&L does not.

The course of studies at Hollins
is flexible enough to provide for
the student who is considering a
profession. However, such a stu-
dent is treated as an exception; at
WA&L, the profession-oriented  stu-
dent is the rule.

At W&L, there is not a_ single
woman professor, There are female
lab technicians, assistants and secre-
taries. However, the reverse is not
true at Hollins. Approximately 68%
of the teaching faculty is male.
Women comprise a disproportionate
number of lecturers and visiting
professors, however none of the de-
partment chairmen are women, The
president of the college is a man-—
so are the dean, the psychologist,
the chaplain, the business manager,
the physician, and the chairman,
vice chairman, and secretary-treas-
vrer of the Board of Trustees. W&L
even employs a gynecologist; Hol-
lins does not.

Another major diflerence between
the two schools is in the life styles
of the students. The W&L student
has the freedom to choose where
and how he wants to live. Dormi-
tory living is only one option. Stu-
dents can also live off-campus and
function as members of the com-
munity in their dealings with the
landiord (or lady), the grocer, the
gas company. At Hollins, there is
no alternative to on-campus resi-
dence. A student may live in her
ewn room, with another student, or
in a college-owned apartment.
Meais and all other necessities are
provided. Consequently, the Hollins
student has littie direct contact with
the community, and she is required
io make few decisions outside the
academic realm.

The W&L world is not a five-
day one. H exists on week-ends,
too, Despite the introduction of
parietals at Hollins, dormitories
which house large numbers of
women impose restrictions. The
standardization of dormitery rooms
presents a sharp contrast to the
personalized atmosphere of a stu
dent apartment or house. One is a
place where a student stays (or is
kept) for a year; the other is a place
where a student lives.

The Hollins student exists in two
worlds, the academic and the social.
Often. there is little connection be
tween the two. Hollins is the center

of her academic life; she usually
chooses to leave campus for social
purposes.

Segregation of the sexes by plac-
ine them in separate schools makes
it veritably impossible for a man
and a woman to maintain a friend-

ship. The very distance between
WAL and Hollins makes it difficult
for friends to talk to each other

when they need to, and for them to
see each other within an academic,

keeping with a very satisfying first
part.”

Sha-Na-Na is scheduled to invade
Washington and Lee again with its
wild antics and songs on Saturday,
February 12 to entertain at the an-
nual Faney Dress dance. Sha-Na-
Na will perform for one-half of the
evening, to be preceeded by a group
called The Embers. The four hour
dance will open doors at 9:00 p.m.
at Evans Dining Hall. Bert Meem
describes the affair as a “greasy
dress, costume deal with dress out
of the 1950's, for example a tuxedo
styled around 1950 or other fashions
in the Sha-Na-Na tradition.” Beer
and wine will be sold at a fraction
above cost and Fancy Dress en-
thusiasts are prohibited from bring-
ing their own beverages, or as Presi-
dent Meem advises, “no B,Y.O.L.!"

Beyond the popular Fancy Dress
date, Dance Board plans are not
definite. Negotiations are under
way with Black Oak Arkansas and
Brewer and Shipley for the March
{1 concert date. That concert will
be the first held in the new gym-
nasiiim and as a result more con-
cert-goers will be able to be ac-
commodated. As it was for the
Gordon Lightfoot concert last No-
vember in the old Doremus gym,

customers had to be turned away
at the door.
For the Spring term, April 29 or

May 13 are the possible dates and
the group being considered is one
from Atlanta which performs The
Who's rock opera, “Tommy.”
Neither the group fer March 11
nor the date or performers for the
Spring concert have been definitely
decided upon, but the groups above
do represent the direction in which
the future plans of the Dance Board
are heading.

The Dance Board acts upon sug-
gestions by board members, who
are in turn acting upon names
heard from people around campus.
Names heard from what Bert Meem
calls “a reasonable number of peo-
ple, say 25-50" are considered at
Dance Board meetings. According
to Meem, “The board maintains
the best possible set-up with its
agent. In fact. he came down for
the Lightfoot concert.”

Price of the groups and availabl:
Dance Board funds are the deciding
factors in negotiations and eventual
bookings by the board. Meem notes.
“We are limited to up-and-coming
or dying groups. We prefer the for-
mer. Although we cannot effectively
compete with the larger universities.
we do extremely well for a school
of our size.”

Whether the Chambers Brothers
or Gordon Lighifoot can be con-
sidered up-and-coming or dying or
either may be debated. In any case.
the drawing power of such enter-
tainers here at Washington and Lee
cannot be disputed. The Dance
Board believes its offerings for the
rest of this season will prove as suc-
cessiul as those of the past.

P.E. Skiing Course
Offered At Homestead,

Draws 108 Students

BY PRESTON SIMPSON

A physical education course in
skiing is being offered to Washing-
ton and Lee students for the first
time this winter. The University’s
athletic department has made ar-
rangements with the Homestead, a
resort in Hot Springs, Virginia, to
allow students to take skiing lessons
from professional instructors at a
reduced rate.

The course may be taken for
credit in physical education or on
an audit basis. It is also open to
faculty and their families. Partici-
pants must pay a fee of $30.00 if
they provide their own equipment
or $42.00 if they rent equipment
from the Homestead. They must
also provide their own transporta-
tion to and from the Homestead.

To complete the course a stu-
dent must spend any six weekday
afternoons at the Homestead be-
tween January 10 and March 3. He
will receive a two-hour lesson from
a staff of professional ski instruc-
tors directed by Sepp Kober. The
rest of the afternoon is for free
practice on the slopes,

The course has never before been
offered to W&L students, but it al-
ready appears to be a success ac-
cording to Coach Dick Miller of the
Washington and Lee Athletic De-
partment, who made the arrange-
ments with the ski school. There
are 98 students taking the course
for credit with another ten people
auditing. Coach Miller stated that
the University is trying to make
physical education more attractive
to students, and he hopes the new
course will be successful toward that
end,

$20,000 Grant
Given To W&XL

Student efforts at Washington and
Lee University have been rewarded
with a $20,000 grant from a North
Carolina foundation to be used in
offering scholarships to economically
disadvantaged students. :

The grant from the Hillsdale
Fund, Inc., of Greensboro was made
as a result of a proposal designed by
the Student Recruitment Commit-
tee at Washington and Lee. an
agency of the student government.

The $20.000 is to be awarded at
the rate of $5,000 a year for four
years, according to terms of the
erant. The first scholarships to quali-
fied students will be awarded in
the 1972-73 year

The Hillsdale Fund award will be
administered by the University Com-
mittee on Student Financial Aid, as
are all scholarship and loan funds.
Student representatives serve on that
committee in matters of policy but
not in the consideration of indivi
dual applications.

the Hillsdale grant is the second

Generals Edge Navy, Fall To Lehigh,

BY PALMER TRICE

Even the greatest of all sports
teams go through periods during
which they search for the right
combination, for that certain in-
tangible asset which determines a
championship team. Some teams go
for years without finding it. There
is no guarantee that they ever will.
Tom Landry and his Dallas Cow-
boys have searched since the early
60's for this asset. Not until Coach
Landry decided to start Roger Stau-
bach did the Cowboys find this mys-
terious trait. Well, Coach Verne
Canfield’s Generals are still look-
ing for this key person or combina-
tion. There can be no doubt that
W&L has the talent. Last year's
squad found it early, and ran off
an impressive 17-8 record, Every-
one is back, except that champion-
ship mystique,

This is not to say that the 1971-
72 Generals are to be declared a
major disaster area. There is too
much talent to do that. | would be
the first to admit that this year’s
schedule is tougher than those in
the past. Unlike no. 1 ranked
U.C.L.A., the Generals’ December
schedule was a tenacious one. The
coup detat, of course, was opening
with soon-to-be ranked no. 11 Vir-
ginia. Despite the difficulty of their
early schedule, the Blue B-ballers
took a winning record into the
Christmas holidays.

The hoopers returned early, in
order that they be ready for their
January 5 encounter with the Naval
Academy, at Annapolis. The rivalry

between these two schools has devel-
oped over the last several years, es-
pecially on the basketball court.
The Generals went into the game
with four shooters averaging dou-
ble figures: Mike Daniel, with 22
points a game, Paul McClure, with
15.2 points per contest, Skip Licht-
fuss, with 14.6, and John Glace,
with 14 per game. Offensively,
Washington and Lee was scoring at
a rate of about 85 points a game,
but the usually tough defense was
giving up a little more.

Against the Middies, the Generals
played fairly good ball, until the last
five minutes of the game. Then, for-
tunately for us, Navy wouldn’t even
take the game on a silver platter.
No doubt the Blue defense was
tough during those closing minutes,
but the offense was non-existent.
Charlie Strain’s two foul shots, with
about a minute and a half left, were
all that saved the visitors from de-
feat. Up by as much as 12 during
the second half, the Generals lost
their scoring punch as the game
came to a close. The Midshipmen
closed to 55-52, with 1:45 remain-
ing. Strain’s two foul shots put the
Blue up by five. With 52 seconds
left in the game, the Naval Acad-
emy closed to 57-54, and five sec-
onds later they came within one, At
the 38 second mark, the Middies
controlled a jump ball, The Gen-
erals fell back into a 2-1-2 defense,
and the Middies held the ball for
the last shot. With six seconds re-
maining, they worked the ball in-
side and put it up, only to have big

Paul MeClure block the shot and

game!

On the sixth, Washington and Lee
entertained the Engineers of Lehigh,
within the not so friendly confines
of New Doremus Gymnasium.
From the outset, it was apparent
that the gods on Mount Olympus
were not to be with us, Mighty Zeus
had decreed that the ball should not
and would not go through our bas-
ket. Defensively, Coach Canfield
tried to keep us in the ball game by
employing a variety of defenses, in-
cluding the 1-3-1, the 2-1-2, and a
full-court press. Lehigh scored only
32 points in the first half, but the
host team could only muster 18
points.

In the second half, the Generals
came out pressing, and, amazingly
enough, the ball went through the
hoop. Slowly but surely, the home
town club crept up on the visiting
Engineers, With 5:05 remaining,
Paul McClure pulled the Generals
to within two, 59-57, Perhaps the

with 4:33 left, Mike Daniel picked
up his fifth foul. The Generals stay-
ed within range, but never quite got
there. No one was able to hit their
crucial foul shots as the game wan-
ed. The final statistics showed W&L
hitting on only 5 of 21 free throws.
The Generals showed sparks of
their past glory, but still failed to
come up with that one big win.

Monday night, the squad travelled
to Bridgewater. The official statistics
are not yet in, but the Blue seems
to have finally put it all together in
nailing down a convincing 85-70
victory. Paul McClure led the Gen-
erals by scoring 22 points and block-
ing six shots. He also hauled down
18 rebounds in the Blue’s best game
yet. Mike Daniel hit for 20 points,
and Doug Clelan added 18, most of
them coming on long jumpers. The
Generals hit on over fifty per cent
of their shots from the floor and
13 of 16 from the foul line. Maybe

Trial of the Boobirds

BY BOB “LASH” LARUE

Perhaps a lot of people are
going to be angered by what I have
to say this week, but to those per-
sons | reply with one of Coach
Boyd William's favorite aphorisms:
if the shoe fits, wear it. Thus fore-
warned, read on,

Last week at the Washington and
Lee basketball game with Lehigh, I
noticed among the audience the ap-
palling predominance of a species
of spectator similar to the boobirds
who thrive in such sport cities as
Philadelphia and Baltimore. This
creature finds fault with the officiat-
ing, both the opposing and the home
teams, and just about anything and
everything connected with an event.
The Philadelphia variety have been
known to boo the National Anthem.

Fortunately, this type of boobird
has not reached the southwestern
Virginia area in great numbers.
‘True, there exist some cynics who
laugh at the athletic efforts of not
just the W&L basketball players but
also those in baseball, football and
other sports. And it is only a natural
part of the environment, meaning
our home court, that we would find
a large number of individuals who
criticize the referees, especially
when they rule against the Gen-
erals. As I say, these are somewhat
natural and may be unavoidable.
Nevertheless, | hope neither variety
increases in size in the Lexington
area, for | feel both would be harm-
ful to W&L athletics.

However, to return to the ob-
ject of this excursion, I have no-
ticed that a particular species of the
boobird has taken root here and are
in abundance in the new W&L
gym. This spectator, whenever an
opposing player steps to the foul
line. unloads with a series of whis-
tles, shouts and cat calls designed
(he thinks) to rattle the baliplayer
into missing the foul shot. All kid-
ding aside, this is one of the most
immature and ineffective tactics that
a fan can possibly use. In a word,
its bush. Not only does it reflect
on the school. but it makes one
wonder what kind ef yo-yo donkeys
are sitting in the stands. It is a
thoroughly disgusting gesture, out-
done in stupidity only by the throw-
ing of pennies onto the court. some-
thing which was also childishly pop-
ular over in the old gym a couple

of years ago. And for those of you
who seem to think otherwise, such
noises rarely, more likely never, dis-
turb the foul shooter into missing.

All I can say is, clean up your
act, boobirds. And if there is any-
one who can possibly concoct a de-
fense for such behavior, you're wel-

Captains Named
for ’72 Football

Quarterback Steve Fluharty, of-
fensive lineman Don Eavenson and
linebacker Tim Haley have been
elected tri-captains of the 1972
WA&L football squad,

They were elected by their team-
mates at a post-season squad meet-
ing. All are rising seniors.

Fluharty has won All-State, All-
Conference and All-American
honorable mention honors during
his two years as the Generals’ quar-
terback. As a sophomore, the St.
Petersburg. Florida native ranked
seventh in the nation in passing and
twentieth in total offense. In his
two-year career, he has completed
205 of 427 passes for 2,398 yards
and 14 touchdowns.

Eavenson has been a regular for
the past two years in the W&L of-
fensive line, alternating at guard
and tackle, and consistently graded
high on the offensive line charts.
fhe Abington, Pennsylvania pro-
duct also is a starting defenseman
on W&L’s nationally-ranked lacrosse
team.

Haley called defensive signals for
the Generals from his middle line-
backer post this year. He was sec-
ond in tackling—behind 1971 team
co-captain Dave Brooks—with 66
individual tackles and 19 assists. In
his sophomore season he initiated
52 tackles and was in on $0 more.
He is from Winchester, Virginia.

When a Hollins student comes to

to like his friends and adjust to his
