Szlasa Named
Coach of Year

For Lacrosse

Washington and Lee lacrosse coach
Dick Szlasa Saturday was named the
1971 national “lacrosse coach of the
year” for the NCAA college division,

The award, voted by his fellow
coaches, was presented to Szlasa
during the concluding banquet of
the U.S. Intercollegiate Lacrosse As-
sociation (USILA) convention at At-
ltnic City, N.J.

Richie Moran, coach of Cornell's
national champion lacrosse team,
was named the top coach for the
university division,

Now in his fifth year at W&L,
Szlasa turned teams which had rec-
ord of 2-7 and 1-8 into teams which
posted records of 8-3 and 11-2. His
1971 team shared the South Atlantic
Division co-championship and was
voted the top college division team
in the country and ranked seventh
in the nation over-all,

With most of the 1971 team re-
turning, Szlasa’s 1972 Generals are
expected to contend for the national
championship.

The W&L schedule this year in-
cludes bouts with Navy, Johns Hop-
kins, and Virginia, among others.

New Course In

African

BY PAUL LANCASTER

A new course in politics will be
offered for the first time during the
spring term in 1972, in which stu-
dents from W&L will travel to East
Africa to view the political situation
in developing countries.

“The course, known as Politics
255, will be offered every two years,
if the necessary arrangements can
be made,” says Mr. James Loesel,
instructor of politics and the person
who will instruct this new course.

The course is similar in theory to
Politics 254, “Political Problems in
Underdeveloped Nations”, but, as
Loesel says, “It is an attempt to take
people out into the field to see what
it (the political situation) really looks
like. It's difficult to imagine how it
all fits together without seeing it.”

The course itself is worth six cred-
its, and Politics 101, “Comparative
Government”, is a prerequisite. Stu
dents enrolled in the course will
leave for East Africa April 10 and
will stay until around the end of
May

Loesel estimated that the costs ol
the course would estimate at $1200
$1500 for the entire term, with
about $850 of that needed for trans
portation, A maximum of 12 stu
dents will be taken into the course,
and seven students have already in

explain the substance of the course.

“We'll continue to Uganda to
Kampala, and stay for one week
paying particular attention to the
political problems of Uganda (which
is now under military rule). We'll
return to Nairobi then take a
field trip to Tanzania, particularly to
the capital of the East African Com
munity, Arusha. We'll be returning
to Nairobi via the coastal city of
Mombasa, to study the Arab influ
ence on East Africa.

“The course would conclude in
Nairobi, and the students would be
free about the time when exams fin
ish at WAL. I intend to stay in East
Africa, and I'll strongly encourage
the others to stay. I feel that they'll
have the savvy about travel, accom
modation, and sights to see after the
course, so that touring the area
would be far more profitable than it
would be without this preparation

Loesel emphasized that the course
is not only beneficial to politics
majors, but to other students as well
“The students will be free on week
ends to take advantage of one of the

“This will be an opportunity foi

Loesel contemplated the unique
ness of the course, “East Africa is a
most desired place for tourists, but
few have had the chance to actually
get inside the society. Most profes-
have the necessary con

and generally, students are limited
to an exchange program with the

EC Reminder

BY STEVE ROBINSON

President of the Student Body
On Saturday, for the third
time, Washington and Lee men
will begin independent exams,
There are a few things that
should be emphasized before the
exams begin.
1. Independent exams are a priv-
ilege, and one that benefits the
students greatly. We have this
benefit because of the Honor
System and the faith that is
placed in it by the faculty as well
as students.
2. Tests during independent ex-
ams will be given repeatedly
throughout the exam period, un-
like quizzes given during the reg-
ular semester, Hence, any com-
ments made during the exam
period may give information to
someone who has not taken the
test yet. Therefore, to insure the
integrity or each exam to every
student, students should refrain
from making comments about
tests until the exam period is over
at noon on Friday, December 17.

In light of these conditions, the
Executive Committee made the
following statement Monday
night:

The Executive Committee re
minds students that identical ex
aminations are given throughout
the examination period, and
therefore, the E.C., in the pos
sible strongest terms, discourages
vay comment about the examina
tions during the examination per
iod, Any comment, regardless of
iis nature, may be treated as a
possible honor violation,

Huntley Reveals
Student Selections

Upon the recommendations and
with the advice of the University
Council, the EC, and each of the
committees concerned, President of
the University R. E. R. Huntley
made the following student appoint-
ments to faculty standing commit-
tees. The announcement was releas-
ed by the president's office this week.

All of the following appointments
are made for the remaining portion
of this academic year:

(1) Admissions Committee, There
is currently one student serving on
this committee, James Gregory Wil-
son, ‘72, The student representation
is increased to two with the appoint-
ment of Griff Steel, °73. Both stu-
dents will have voting privileges on
all matters except those pertaining
to individual applications.

(2) Athletic Committee. The stu-
dent representation of two is in-
creased to three with the addition
of Johnny Lee White, °74.

(3) Curriculum Committee, David
Roger Munsick, Jr., °72 and Steven
Edward Lewis, °72, both current
members of the Student Curriculum

Committee, are appointed to serve
on the faculty body as well,

(4) Financial Aid Committee. Two
students are added to this committee
who shall have voting privileges on
all matters save those pertaining to
individual applications or determina-
tions, The men selected are James
Davis, °72 and William Bradley Hill,
i Th

(5) Library Committee, Currently,
the Chairman of the Student Library
Committee, Bill West, '72, serves as
a member of this committee. Two
other students have been added, Jim
Zeppieri, ‘73 and Carlyle Gregory,
‘74. Since the Student Library Com-
mittee has been disbanded, the three
remaining members, Bill Miller, °72,
Bill Woodward, ‘72, and John
Tucker, ‘72, have been asked by the
President to serve for the remainder
of the academic year as non-voting
advisory members.

(6) Student representation on the
Courses and Degrees Committee
and the Faculty Executive Commit-
tee remains unchanged. Each com-
mittee has one student member.

UC Explores Endowment,
Black Admissions, Tenure

With University President R. E. R.
Huntley and Student Body President
Steve Robinson presiding, the Uni-
versity Council held its December
meeting last Friday afternoon.
Topics discussed by the joint student-
faculty body included financial aid
funds for black students, the overall
state of the endowment, and the
procedure for granting faculty ten-
ure.

In response to student question-
ing, members of the administration
outlined the current state of efforts
to recruit black students for W&L.
It was pointed out that though the
amount of financial aid available for
this purpose was smaller this year
than in previous years, this was to
be expected since grants to black
students already enrolled have had
to be continued. There were sixteen
black students admitted the first year
of the program, about half of the ap-
plicants accepted by the university.

“We accepted the same number
this year,” remarked Dean William
McC. Schildt, associate Director of
Admissions, “But we lost out in the
competition with other schools, more
so than the previous year.”

Senior Bob Carrere asked whether
the university had considered taking
some students “with less than a col-
lege preparatory background and
then supplementing his learning with
some remedial work through a Black
Union or whatever =

Schildt said that in order to be
fair with such students, the univer
sity would have to be prepared to
make up any deficiency. He added
that the “Upward Bound” remedial
program had been explored by

Lexington just

held its

WAL two ago, but it was
found that federal aid is
forthcoming only for larger univer
sities,

In the review of black applicants,
Schildt said, grades and class rank
are considered “the better predic-
tors” as opposed to College Board
scores. There have been no excep
tions made concerning the minimum
standards of secondary school credits
and distribution—‘“the Admissions
Committee feels confident that it
can get a sufficient number of stu-
dents who meet these requirements,”
Schildt stated.

In the segment of the
meeting, University treasurer James
Whitehead summarized the current
state of the endowment. As it stands,
the endowment totals between $20 to
$22 million. Steve Robinson
tioned the interest from this total,
which last year yielded some $355,
000. Mr. Whitehead replied that this
figure was misleading, because it did
not take into account the total divi-
dends and appreciation from the en
dowment,

Whitehead explained that opera
tional University services
were going up, and that price rises
have been planned for January in
the Cockpit. The tavern registered a
$4000 last year, which was
not offset by small profits in the
Supply Store and the Bookstore

| OUTLOOK and REVIEW |

Not many colleges or universities can claim’an on-campus,
school owned and sanctioned tavern. Washington and Lee
University is one of the few. We have the “Cockpit” located
in the University Center.

The new Early-Fielding Memorial Building has been a
great asset to the University, The structure houses television
rooms, meeting rooms, offices for student organizations, and
a gameroom. At long last the independents, as well as frater-
nity men, have a place to congregate, socialize and just get
drunk if the need be.

Despite these advantages the University Center has had
some significant problems. First, townspeople regularly would
take over the Cockpit and not exactly conduct themselves like
ladies and gentlemen. Mixers were especially trying events for
members of the University Center Committee who oversee the
building’s functions. With regularity visitors would start
swinging and it was the Cockpit which received the real dam-
age. Aside from the fact the tavern was built with W&L stu-
dent customers in mind, the Cockpit is a public business. Only
with great difficulty and some recent luck has this problem
diminished.

The most obvious problem today is that the Cockpit is not
recording a profit. Over the last two years the tavern and
gameroom have not been self-supporting. Mr. Marshall Sum-
ner, manager of the Cockpit, admits the excess of expenses
over income. He claims that there is little that can be done
under the existing situation, “This whole problem is just
coming to light,” he added.

According to Sumner there was an oversight in the plan-
ning of the Cockpit. Originally, a food service was not antici-
pated by the building’s designers. The planners as far as
Sumner can surmise, wanted a rathskeller set-up, which would
serve only beer. The Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control
Board did not think that was such a super idea. It seems that
state statutes will not allow the exclusive sale of beer. “The
ABC said we must sell food, if we sell beer; and at least 50
per cent of our sales must be food,” Sumner added. He also
pointed out that ABC men check his receipts monthly just to
make sure,

In the Cockpit’s construction only a bar and a storage
room were provided for. Sumner had to convert the small
storage room into a cramped, hot kitchen. Sumner observed

that, “I’m operating out of a storage room. It was a last min-
ute decision to throw in a grill and a deep-fryer.”

I-xpansion of the kitchen or would-be storage room seems
necessary if the Cockpit can operate within the law and make
a profit. Mr, Sumner admits that “the bar is not very efficient.
It is a beautiful New York style bar but it should be out
among the booths, where it could be serving more folks.”
Such an expensive expansion seems tragic only two years
after the building’s completion, but the mistake was made. It
should be corrected. With the Cockpit losing money, it is ap-
parent that the enterprise cannot raise the funds on its own.
Only the University is capable of underwriting such an un-
dertaking.

Some people might say this expansion is unneeded. They
would encourage the Cockpit to try harder to make a profit.
But, currently the tavern serves about 250 people daily. Sum-
ner wishes that he could serve “lots more”, but the grill is “at
its maximum in food production.” During an average month
the Cockpit has about $8000 in sales. In recent months sales
have risen,

Although sales have gone up, the profit margin has not,
Sumner summarized the reasons for this phenomenon. “The
wage-price freeze hit us hard this summer. There have been
no price increases since last January.” Sumner plans a price
increase next month at the beginning of the Winter Term.
According to the government's guidelines, there will probably
be a two-and-a-half per cent hike.

Also the Cockpit employs mostly student waiters, Often
student workers are not the most efficient from a business per-
spective. When exams and test periods come, it is often hard
to get enough student workers, But Sumner emphasized that
“the school would like for me to use students.”

Still another cause for the absence of profits in the Cock-
pit is the exclusive sale of 3.2 beer, Many bars in Lexington
sell 6.4 beer. Why should anybody drink 3.2 beer when he can
drink 6.4 in plenty of other spots? Because the school is ad-
hering to the law, i.e. selling 3.2 beer to the under twenty-one
year-olds, it is probably losing some possible business,

With these facts in mind, it seems that the Cockpit is not
operating without some restraints, The bar should be expand.
ed, at the very least, so that the tavern can serve its customers
a bit better. Having this tavern can be quite a boon to the

University, As has already been said, few colleges have as nice
a place to go, so close to campus. Yet, unless the tavern can
pay its own way, it is quite a burden,

Like numerous characteristics of
Washington and Lee, tenure is a
tradition. Yet, unlike many of the
University’s other traditions, tenure
does not belong to Washington and
Lee exclusively. Tenure is an ac-
cepted feature at just about every
institution of higher education in the
United States. Widespread accept-
ance does not, however, assure un-
contested existence for the tenure
system at American universities.

As it has done numerous times in
the past, the academic community is
currently re-debating the system and
its implications, That the tenure sys-
tem survives and has survived for so
long is in itself, some advocates be-
lieve, comment on tenure’s value,
Tenure is not free from critics nor
free from questioning however.
Much of the debate can be decided,
first of all, by an explanation of ten-
ure and its intended purpose.

The purpose of tenure is to assure
academic freedom for professional
teachers and scholars by providing
a certain degree of job security fol-
lowing a period of probationary em-
ployment. A tenured faculty member
is not exempt from dismissal, but
can only be dismissed for “adequate
cause” and by due academic pro-
cess, with an emphasis on self-peer
group evaluation,

Academic freedom is appraised to
be that atmosphere in which acade-
micians openly discuss new ideas
and theories, however unconven-
tional; indulge in extensive research
and investigations; and publish re-
sults of such activities, if they so de-
sire, free from institutional censor-
ship and fear of unemployment.

Proponents of tenure stress that
the ultimate end of tenure is pre-
servation of this academic freedom
and that the resulting degree of pro-
fessional ‘security is merely a means,
and in their opinion, the best means,
of attaining this end. As taken from
Washington and Lee's faculty and
Board of Trustees approved state-
ment on “Faculty Appointments,
Tenure, and Academic Freedom”,
“the functional purpose of the prin-
ciple of academic tenure is to create
an atmosphere of mutual good faith
and dedication in achieving a stimu-
latifg intellectual exchange between
members of the University commun-
ity.”

The greatest debates are not con-
cerned so much with whether or not
academic freedom should be main-
tained, Such freedom is, with its en-
couragement of professionalism and
learning, considered a vital element
of society's process of self-improve-
ment. Rather, the debates center
around: determining exactly what
“adequate cause” for dismissal en-
tails; those standards institutions set
and require their candidates to meet
in order for them to gain tenure; the
problem of tenured faculty members
who discredit the confidence and
dodge some of the responsibilities
invested in them after their having
attained the degree of job security;
and finally, since it has such debat-
able points about it, whether or not
there is a better system by which

It is highly indicative of the cur-
rent state of world affairs that In-
dia—a nation that has for the past
Six years repeatedly condemned the
United States with “imperialism and
colonialism” in Vietnam—is itself
currently engaging in both these ac-
tivities in its relations with Pakistan.
In spite of its feverish denunciations
of the American position on South-
east Asia, India has now seen fit to
attempt to imperialize and colon-
ialize East Pakistan by turning it
into the satellite state of “Bangla
Desh.”

Over the past twenty-four years
India has found itself in constant
and bitter conflict with Pakistan; al-
though an uneasy truce has been in
effect for most of that time, still a
potential state of war has existed
and has broken into armed conflict
on three occasions, The first two
conflicts, however, did not involve
East Pakistan, where there was in
both campaigns but limited action.
Now that India has seen an oppor-
tunity to utilize the ancient axiom of
“Divida et Impera,” she has moved
aggressively and dynamically to sep-
erate the two halves of her enemy
and thus to weaken the western state
while making the eastern part into a
subservient colony similar to Nepal
or Sikkim.

India’s move at this time was a

India and Bangla Desh

academic freedom can be assured,
Tenure at Washington and Lee
parallels the 1940 “Statement of
Principles On Academic Freedom
and Tenure” as it was formally
drawn up by the American Associa-
tion of University Professors in con-
junction with the Association of
American Colleges, This statement is
the principal foundation for the
tenure system in the United States.
At Washington and Lee, awarding
of tenure to a faculty member is
preceded by a determined number of
term appointments, that is, a pro-
bationary period during which the
faculty member's performance is ob-
served and evaluated. For Instruc-
tors and Assistant Professors, the
total period of service on term ap-
pointments cannot exceed seven
years, For Associate Professors and
Professors, the maximum period of
service is two years. Any appoint-
ment which extends beyond these
service periods is considered a ten-
ure appointment. A faculty member
whose term renewal and, therefore,
tenure has been decided against is
given notice far in advance of the
date of his dismissal. Tenure may
also be granted before expiration of
a term appointment or even upon
initial appointment to the University.
A hierarchy of committees and
administrators is involved in the
tenure granting procedure at Wash-
ington and Lee. The Board of
Trustees is the final authority in the
matter. The Board receives its rec-
ommendations from President Hunt-
ley who, in return, relies upon the
advice of the Advisory Committee
which is comprised of the three
Deans: William J. Watt (of the Col-
lege), Roy Lee Steinheimer (of the
Law School), and Edward C, At-
wood (of the School of Commerce,
Economics, and Politics) and also
three faculty members elected by the
faculty. From here, the procedure
depends upon the various depart-
ment heads and their experiences
with their faculty members. The
recommendations are based upon in-
formal observations and the relation-
ships created within the University
community rather than upon any
systematic process. Some depart-
ments employ team teaching and, as
a consequence, quality of teacher
performance becomes known.

As Dean of the College, William
J, Watt is concerned with tenure and
its application and meaning here at
Washington and Lee. Regarding this
topic of the formation of recom-
mendations, Dean Watt notes, “We
also hear from students, student
feedback you might call it. There are
many things involved that you can’t
help but observe, things that every-
one on campus discovers, There is a
great advantage in being small, too”,
he points out, “as relationships be-
tween faculty and administrators are
easily had. Everyone knows each
other.” In a community as small as
Washington and Lee's, word gets
around,

In evaluating a candidate for ten-
ure, the University uses basically the
same criteria as it does for granting
salary increases, reappointments, and

careful and well planned action de-
signed to take into account the cur-
rent tension within the two halves
of Pakistan. India did not fare as
well as she had hoped in the last
war: with a large portion of her
military force restricted to guarding
the critical Chinese border, she was
unable in a western war to obtain a
direct victory, With the possibility
of fighting a weak and divided Pak-
istan, though, India has provoked a
conflict in which her opponent is
forced to split her forces between
fighting a civil war and repelling the
invader. While the military situation
is still not clear, and while prelimi-
nary indications are that Pakistan is
holding her own, still the situation is
now far more favorable to India
than it was in the 1965 war.

The conflict is not a clearly re
wived issue for the United States
although India has allied herself re-
cently to the Soviet Union, Pakis
tan has made self-defense pacts of
a similar nature with Red China
Whichever way we turn might well
reinforce either a Soviet or Chinese
presence in the Indian Ocean basin
and further weaken western power
im this crucial region, There is no
absolute right or wrong in this crisis,
and no clear-cut path for this nation
we can only work to bring both sides
to the truce table and attempt to
end this open aggression by India

students, his willingness to keep on
his subject and his preservation of a
sense of balance or humor. More
readily measured signs of the candi-
date’s merit are: degrees earned, any
publications, professional papers,
summer study or teaching, and simi-
lar signs of scholarly activity.

After tenure has been granted,
new implications arise. The most
significant is in deciding just what
constitutes “adequate cause” for dis-
missal. The University policy states
that, “a faculty member shall have
permanent and continuous tenure,
which is defined as meaning that his
services shall not be terminated or
his academic rank reduced except
for adequate cause, or because of
attainment of the established retire-
ment age, or under extraordinary
circumstances because of financial
exigencies,”

The problem of determining “ade-
quate cause” has not arisen too fre-
quently here at Washington and
Lee. “My general impression is that
most people work out,” says Dean
Watt. As possible examples of “ade-
quate cause” for dismissal, he cites
instances of “noticeably ineffective
teaching, inclusion of irrelative mat-
ter in classroom discussion, or per-
haps some flagrant moral violation,”
The Dean stresses the “each case
has to be judged on its own merits
and such cases are not very common
at the University.” A financial exig-
ency might be the elimination of a
department, thereby causing unem-
ployment. University policy also
states that a tenure appointment ex-
pires the June following the teach-
er’s 65th birthday. In such cases, the
teacher may be reappointed for one
year terms up to his 70th birthday.

It is clear, then, that tenure does
not provide life-long employment
security. Tenured people face many
uncertainties even though they are
few compared to the non-tenured
person. The most significant differ-
ence between the tenured and non-
tenured teacher has to do with the

BY JOHNNY MORRISON

My first article seems to have
caused many students to see the rele-
vance of community control. I have
been approached by both those who
agree with me and also those who do
not agree with me. My fellow stu-
dents who find it quite arduous to
understand why we Blacks advocate
community control may agree with
us after reading this article.

Recently, demands by groups that
have traditionally had litthe power—
mostly Blacks and affluent White
students—for larger and enhanced
roles in the making of policies that
affect their lives have been both
hailed and condemned. | think that
those who condemn these demands
are what we call “advocates of the
status quo.” These are the people
who are characterized as being very
conservative and traditional, When
| say conservative, | am talking
about the American concept of con-
servatism and not the British con-
cept, Any student of political sei-
ence or of any knowledge of the
political make-up of the British gov-
ernment knows that many programs
which were carried out by the Con-
servative Party would be considered
a drastic and radical change by the
Americans who incidentally happen
to be conservative,

The hope of Blacks to become the
inttiator of inputs which may be
helpful or detrimental to their life
has brought into being a key issue of
the political agenda for the last
twelve years, It was reported during
the 1968 Presidential campaign that,
“Mr, Humphrey's private polls have
shown that what voters of all per
suasions Want most is a sense of
participation in the political process,
a feeling that they can be heard and
have their doubts addressed.”

Any student who has had a course
in American History knows that feel
ings such as the above are not new
among Americans, The early colo-
nists main argument with the
mother country (Great Britain) was
that they were being treated as see

ond-class cilizvens and being sub
jected to “taxation without repre
sentation,”

Most of the times when Black

spokesmen demand more and great

economies apparatus of their respec

burden of proof, In the case of the
tenured teacher, the burden is on the
University to provide proof for dis-
missal, In the case of the non-tenur-
ed teacher, the University is not un-
der any such obligation,

How does Washington and Lee
deal with the tenured professional
scholar or teacher who apparently
takes advantage of his position and
fails to perform up to the expected
standards? Channels are available
for anyone with a complaint against
a certain teacher. For instance, any
student with a complaint is urged to
take the matter up with the teacher
himself, or with the department
head, or a Dean, or even all the way
to the Board of Trustees until he
gains satisfaction. Dean Watt con-
tends that “they should feel free to
come to any of us,”

Many in the academic community
see holes in the structure of tenure,
the largest being this possible pro-
tection of professors who “take ad-
vantage.” One suggested remedy in
this area is proposed by a Mr. Henry
Saltzman, president of Pratt Instit-
ute, in the November 8, 1971 issue
of The Chronicle of Higher Educa-
tion. Mr. Saltzman calls for the for-
mation of a National Tenured Pro-
fessor Accreditation Board which
would evaluate the performance of
each tenured faculty member ac-
cording to “objective, balanced, rea-
sonable standards and criteria.” Mr.
Saltzman urges the academic com-
munity to adopt such a self-policing
system “before other groups within
society (e.g, students, parents, legis-
lators, taxpayers, and university ad-
minisirators) move to impose stand-
ards that may be harmful to the
community of scholars.” Dean Watt
feels “this is something that needs to
be studied just as the University will
continue to study all of its policies.”

Although there is this hole to fill
in the tenure system, the academic
community seems at a loss to devise
any new system which would, most
importantly, preserve academic free-
dom and also command professional-
ism at all times. The community
would rather attempt to fill the holes
in tenure than to scrap the entire
policy in favor of another less effec-
tive one or in favor of none at all.

tive locales, their usual list of re-
forms includes the following: A) de-
volution of as much authority as pos-
sible to neighborhood communities;
B) more representation of the com-
munity on the city council, the board
of education and other policy mak-
ing bodies; C) strong and vigorous
application of public resources to
facilitate the development of Black
controlled businesses; D) more Black
representatives on all levels of public
service——not just token numbers
either; and E) Black representation
in union and labor forces and gov-
ernment contractors,

There are many facets to the
meaning of community control, One
is restructuring and reorienting the
government, What we Blacks across
the country want are federal, state,
and local administrations and policy
makers which will give top priority
to the attainment of racial equality.
We want the type of government
which is inclined and committed to
making policies “with” rather than
“for” the people of their community
—whether they be Black, White,
Jewish, Chicano, etc. What we
(Blacks) want are administrations
which will train us in all areas of the
political and economic make-up of a
community,

In essence, We want to stop being
colonies and want our independence
from the ruling outsiders. To para-
phrase the words of Frantz Fanon,
we will not be moliified by the pro
visions for a few of our number,
who, by adopting the so-called right
speech and cultural and behavior
patterns, do not become an insiru
ment for us (Blacks) but only an in
sirument of the institutions.

My claim that in most revolutions
impatience is usually caused by a
little progress can be made valid if
one only examines the different ap
proaches and techniques used by
Hlacks in the fifties, sixties and now
As one can notice. if he has any
sense of comprehension, the more
progress made the more impatient
we become. This mood is not only a
unique characteristic of the Black
Power movement in America but
can be traced back to past revolu

Cavaliers Whip W@L 113-80

Generals Even Record At 2-2

BY PALMER TRICE

The W&L_ basketball Generals
opened their new Doremus Gym-
nasium last Wednesday with a cele-
bration unmatched in Washington
and Lee history. The fanfare was
overwhelming, as the Generals
sought to open their latest season on
a winning note. But, alas, neither
President Huntley’s opening re-
marks, nor the presence of “Cap'n
Dick” and Cy Young could save the
B-ballers.

W&L set out to accomplish sev-
eral things, few of which succeeded.

‘The Blue were unable to run success-

fully on the quick Cavaliers, The
cross-mountain rivals enjoyed a vast
height advantage, which the home
team was unable to neutralize. They
also were much cooler in their first
test under fire. Even though the
Wahoos did not quite live up to their
advance billing, they overwhelmed
the Generals.

Except for Skip Lichtfuss’ open-
ing drive, and McClure’s tap in at
the 7:13 spot, the Blue stayed in
arrears of the Cavaliers, The Wa-
hoos dominated the game, with Scott
McCandlish racking up both re-
bounds and points. Over a third of
their points were garnered under the
boards,

The final score reflected how
close the Generals actually were in
contention. The 113-80 score was
determined in a large part by the
excellent play of the Virginia subs,
Bob Mckeag, Bob McCurdy, Chip
Miller, and Al Drummond never
eased up on the Generals,

The Wahoos consistently broke
the Generals 1-3-1 press, which re-
sulted in many easy baskets. This de-
stroyed Coach Canfield’s attempts to
use John Dumas, and forced him to
concede size, in hopes of making up
for it with quickness. This didn’t
work,

However, as Coach Canfield said
after the game, don't judge the
players on this performance. The
Blue admittedly looked sloppy, but
they were contending with ACC
competitor Virginia, who just recent-
ly upset always tough Duke, at the
Blue Devils home court.

What turned out to be the third
Washington and Lee Invitational
fournament was played here on Fri-
day and Saturday nights. The open-
ing rounds saw two rather boring
games. In the first one, Drexel de-
feated West Virginia Tech by a score
of 74-63. Both teams played sloppy
ball, with the exception of Drexel’s
sophomore guard, Dave Williams.
Williams got the big baskets for his

Philly team when they needed them.
Steve Lilly also aided his team’s
cause by grabbing 20 rebounds, and
adding 13 points to Williams’ 20.
Lilly had plenty of help under the
boards, as Drexel’s rebounding took
its toll,

Friday night's second game match-
ed up Lycoming College with our
Generals. The first half proved to be
a real see-saw battle, with the home
team finally grabbing a 51-49 lead
at its end. W&L was hurt by sloppy
passing, poor defense, a hot shooting
Lycoming ball club, and an inability
to hit the outside shot, The second
half told a different story, as the
Generals stormed into the lead,
aided by sloppy Lycoming ball han-
dling, and by a Lycoming cold spell.
The Blue ran and ran and ran. For
a change, the ball went through the
hoop. W&L made their own breaks
and capitalized on them, A Gutshall
lay-up launched the Generals over
the hundred mark for the first time
this year. The final score of 107-83
showed two things: the Blue are
going to be more exciting than last
year’s deliberate ball club, and they
also play less defense.

The Generals scoring was well-
balanced. Mike Daniel had 28, John
Glace, 20, Paul McClure, 19, and
Skip Lichtfuss, 18,

Saturday night’s Consolation game
match West Va. Tech against Ly-
coming. W.Va. won this one in over-
time, 74-71, Both teams improved
their performances over those in
Friday’s games,

The championship was Washing-
ton and Lee's first real contest. The
game against U.Va. was a runaway,
and the Lycoming game had turned
into one in the second half, Drexel
was coming off a 7-17 season last
year, but they had won their open-
ing contest, They had two quick
guards in Mike Fee and Dave Wil-
liams, Steve Lilly had proved his
ability as a “big man” (6°3) in the
opening game. Drexel wasn't too big,
but they were quick.

Even with all this in mind, one
had to go with the Generals, They
had all their starters returning from
last year, they were playing at home,
and they had won convincingly the
night before. But from the beginning
things went array. Drexel hit 10 of
their first 12 shots from the field.
Mike Fee and his teammates broke
the Generals 1-3-1 press with ease.
They played good defense, but most
of all they just didn’t miss.

Drexel crashed the boards, giving
WA&L only one shot at the basket.
Panl McClure, meanwhile was hit-
ing 9 of Il from the field, but these

were from outside, and Paul had
little success on the boards, With the
shooting of McClure, and a brief
cold spell by Drexel, the Generals
got back into the ball game by half-
time, 40-36.

Early in the second half, the Blue
press began to work and Drexel con-
tinued its shooting failures, With
11:08 left in the game, the Generals
grabbed a 52-51 lead. But this did
not last long. The Blue were unable
to penetrate the Drexel 1-2-2 zone,
and fell behind once again. This
time, Drexel put it away. They pull-
ed away steadily, with their bench
aiding in the final 86-72 margin,

After the game, President Hunt-
ley awarded the team trophies, and
announced the — All-Tournament
team. It included W.Va,’s John
Gourley, Lycoming’s Rich Hennin-
ger, who averaged 29 points a game,
W&L's Mike Daniel, and the co-
MVP's Mike Fee and Steve Lilly.

In their first venture away from
the not so friendly confines of New
Doremus, the Blue travelled to
Lynchburg Monday night, to take
on the Lynchburg Hornets, This was
a game with some vengeful over-
tones. The Hornets had upset the
Generals last year in a hotly con-
tested battle in Lynchburg. They

Daniel’s 28 points and Charlie
Strain’s 9 assists, the B-ballers walk-
ed off with an 85-75 victory. Coach
Canfield juggled his starting line-up
in an attempt to get more punch out
front. His strategy worked, as he got
a fine performance from the Garden
City, N.Y. junior,

Canfield said it was the best team
effort of the year. “The kids deserv-
ed to win the way they played.” He
was encouraged by the team’s im-
proved rebounding. The Generals
kept the Hornets away from the
boards, and hope to do the same
tonight against the Tigers,

Strain and John Dumas started for
the first time Monday night, “It en-
abled us to start a big lineup”, said
Canfield, with Dumas at 6-4 and
Strain the biggest guard at 6-1, Du-
mas helped out under the boards
and on defense, Strain had five
steals.

Hopefully, the Generals are over
the hump. They entertain a young
Hampden-Sydney ball club on Wed-
nesday night. The Tigers, longtime
rivals of Washington and Lee, lost
their front line from last year’s club,
They also have a new coach at the
helm. Tonight's game will be the last

University Council Views Tenure

(Continued trom page 1)
that any student belief that the text-
book division of the Supply Store
makes inordinate profit was fallaci-
ous.

The final question discussed was
the matter of faculty tenure. Presi-
dent Huntley explained to the Com-
mittee the procedure for granting
tenure, and that every faculty mem-
ber comes under consideration after
a specified number of years. A fac-
ulty member is either given tenure
at that time or he is dismissed.

Professor Mike Pinney suggested
that many students were under the
misapprehension that, once given
tenure, a faculty member cannot be
removed. If there is reasonable
cause, he said, a professor may be
dismissed after a hearing and the
consent of the Board of Trustees.

Salaries and promotions are con-
sidered separately, and neither are
not necessarily dependent on the
length of a professor's career here.
Steve Robinson stated that some stu-
dents feel that certain teachers had

slacked off in their efforts after re-
ceiving the assurances of tenure.
“There is a possibility that a profes-
sor could be goofing off,” comment-
ed Dr. David Elmes, “or perhaps the
professor just doesn’t know he is
being ineffective.”

Several faculty members suggest-
ed that any student who feels his
professor has room for considerable
improvement should let him know
directly. “I wonder how concerned
students are,” Dr. Robert Huntley
remarked, “considering the response
last year to the Curriculum Commit-
tee’s teacher evaluation poll.”

Professor Pinney said that he had
real misgivings about the validity of
any formal poll on teacher evalua-
tion, and he encouraged students to
take their criticisms to the professor
concerned, “Students are always
ready to lampoon a professor they
felt treated them unfairly,” he said.
“I personally have always been hesi-
tant of the over-formalization of the
evaluation technique.”

(Continued from page 2)
clear for one to accept the use of the
colonial analogy now that its valid-
ity is highly questionable. When the
inferiority of Blacks was enforced by
law and custom and when most
Blacks were denied a right to vote,
the validity of the colonial analogy
was indisputable. Now that formal

discrimination has been outlawed
and some institutions are giving
“some” Blacks preferential — treat-

ment, it may seem hyperbolic to one,

To those who still find it ardous to
accept the validity of the colonial
analogy, | can only say to you that
although things have changed some,
we (Blacks) still remain a small and
impoverished minority, We are still
subject to a large degree, in the pub-
lic and private sectors, to institutions
in which our representation at the
top is very minimum and negligible.
Since the white majority as a whole
is unsolicitous of our interests, goals
and aspirations, it is valid to speak
of a white majority tyranny. If we
take recent world history into consid-
eration, the use of the term “colo-
nialism” by Blacks is understand-
able, and felicitous politically if not
analytically.

There is one thing agreed upon by
both Blacks who are committed to
total integration and those bent on
separatism. This one thing is the
colonial analogy. The language of
Black people plays an important
factor with this point also. Most
Black intellectuals and activists have
already agreed that the language of
Blacks and Black politics is used to
explain why Black political and eco-
nomic power is vital and essential
to the molding of self-respect in
Black communities, why the mobili-
zation of the Black masses is a pre-
requisite to equality, and why equal-
ily is a prerequisite to integration.

Blacks’ demands for more com
munity control can be compared to
the societies of the past and the pres-

ereo

 

order, at a tremendous discount.

Fisher selected this student because |):
is uniquely qualified to act as your Fisher
representative. He knows a lot about high fidelity
He's a reliable person. And since he’s a student
himself, he knows what students need in the

vay of stereo equipment.

And since he's the Fisher representative,
\e's got what you need. Because Fisher

makes practically everything.

We invented high fidelity

ent cry for a complete system built
on the theory of participatory de-
mocracy. Many whites today agree
that administrative decentralization
is needed in the nation’s large cities.
Most of them also believe that a
good administration is one which is
sensitive and responsive to its cli-
ents’ desires,

Along this line of reasoning, one
will also find that what most whites
usually have in mind is the delega-
tion of authority from bureaucracies
to field officers (e.g. school board
members and principals) who will
probably seek good community rela-
tions—but, if by chance they “go
native”, they can be brought down
by demotion by their superiors.

Sometimes, one may oppose com-
munity control because of  self-in
terest. Political theorists of the past
said that most people who are hold-
ers of the political and economic
power will be very reluctant to give
it up. Today, one will find that civil
servants Oppose community control
for fear of their profits, etc.

Aside from self-interest, most
whites just simply disbelieve that
Blacks have a legitimate complaint
about the operation of city govern-
ment. They think that we (Blacks)
only have ourselves to blame for our
impoverished condition.

Ihe Kerner Commission in 1968
conducted a survey in fifteen large
cities and asked these questions. “On
the average, Negroes in your urban
area have worse jobs, education, and
housing than white people. Do you
think that this is due mainly to
Negroes having been discriminated
against, or mainly due to something
about Negroes themselves?” This is
how the white respondents answered:

Mainly due to discrimination 19%
Mainly due to Blacks them-
selves 56%

A mixture of both 19%
Don't know 6%

It is shown here that there seems
whites with respect to the causes of
white’s with respect to the causes of
the impoverished conditions of
Blacks. The system—from the cultu-
ral and behavioral patterns to the
political, educational and economic
—is the cause of our impoverished
conditions, Some may think that I
am being “too” blatant in putting
the blame on the institutions and the
system. If we (Black and white alike)
want to make this a real “land of
liberty for all” and a “land of the
free” then let us start accepting the
real causes—no matter how much it
hurts—and work to alleviate them.

For those who believe that social
discrimination is real but are “dis-
inclined to favor community control
because they think that community
control would be a step toward
racial separatism and would only in-
tensify rather than alleviate social
friction, | will write next week’s ar-
ticle for your sake,
