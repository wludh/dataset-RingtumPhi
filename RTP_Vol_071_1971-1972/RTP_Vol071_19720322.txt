EC Run-off Required

‘Contact’

Monday’s balloting for EC repre-
sentatives and class officers has re-
turned Archer Frierson and Rick
Gray to posts on the EC for the
Class of 1973. In the three way race
for sénior class president, Gary
Poliakoff and Lee Thalheimer were
the top vote getters and will face
each other in a runoff tomorrow.
The entire vote for vice presidents
of the arts, commerce, and science
schools was thrown out becatise
most students had voted for more
than one candidate.

The race for the two junior posts
on next year’s EC will be settled in a
runoff tomorrow. In that balloting,
Mike Brittin, Beau Dudley, Steve
Green, and Robert Johnson were
the top four votegetters. Berry Long
easily won the office of class presi-
dent over a small write-in vote, as
did Neil Lutins in the race for class
vice president,

Bob Keatley walked away with
one of the sophomore seats on the
EC. However, Murray Holland and
James Overton will be on the run
off ballot tomorrow for the remain-
ing spot. In the contest for
president, Bill Biesel and Chip Mar-
tin will compete in the runoff. John
Ratzel was elected vice president.

The run off polls will be located
in the freshman quad, the Co-op
and Washington Hall.

President Steve Rob'nson stated
that applications are being accepted
for the position of Chairman of
next year’s Contact program. Ap-
plications should include possible

with a request by the University

Senator Gravel, a _ native of
Springfield, Massachusetts, has serv-
ed as Speaker of the Alaska House
of Representatives. He was elected
as only the third senator in the
state’s nine-year history in 1968.
After defeating incumbent Senator
Ernest Gruening in the Democratic
primary, he succeeded in winning
the Semate seat in a three-way race.

According to Mock Convention
officials, Senator Gravel will make
some general remarks orientated
toawrds the issues drawn up in the
platform of the Mock Convention,
To do this, he will have a copy of
the proposed party platform before
he travels here to make his speech.

After the keynote speech by
Georgia governor Jimmy Carter on
Friday afternoon, May 5, the party
platform, as drawn up by the plat-
form committee, will be presented
to all the delegations for a vote, At
this time, the delegations will be
allowed to modify the platform.

The platform will be designed to
represent the views of the issues as
seen by WAL students and young
people in general. A Mock Con
vention spokesman pointed out that
this will be different from the con-
vention itself, where the students
will try to reflect the opinion of the
nation in the nomination of a candi

son College, and was a Rhodes
Scholar, He served in the State De-

pantment from 1946 until 1951,
when he joined the Rockefeller
Foundation,

Omicron Delta Kappa now has

chapters at more than 100 colleges
and universities throughout the ma-
tion.

March 22, 1972

On $9 Million Gift.

ty this time, everyone involved with Washington and
Lee has learned about the $9 million Sydney Lewis gift to the
University. Certainly, the donation was most generous and
everyone here, the students, faculty, administrators and other
members of the W&L community, is most grateful. Yet one
thing concerning the gift has beem largely overlooked ; that is
Mr. Lewis’ attitude concerning his support of W&L. The
Richmond trustee stated that he’ gaye what he felt able to
sacrifice to his alma mater.»He believed everyone should
share that conviction. That is food for thought for all the
soom to be alumni.

On Election Posters .

A recent comment on campussweat something like this:
“Is that a building behind all those posters?” The unfortunate
ansaver is yes, yes, yes!

There are over 4000, count ‘em, 4000, election posters plas-
tered acress W&L. The University-.Journalism Press has
printed an averageof 200 posters for each of 28 politico pat-
rons during this 1972°clection season. The result is posters
everywhere. Posters adorn trees, statues, sidewalks, stairs,
chairs; benehes, doors, floors, columns, fences, windows, and
walls,

No candidate has yet been able to give a legitimate ra-
tionale for this sophisticated mannerof littering. Usually one
candidate gets out his masking tape and goes to work merely
because his opponent or oppowents have already splattered
their names on every conceivable surface. This is understand-
able as a form of genuine competition, but the remnants mar
“the hill” long after the competition and polling are past.

Perhaps, as a sad commentary on the electorate (or at
least the candidates’ estimation of the voters), the red, blue,
orange, yellow, and pink placards haves NOTHING to say.
The posters only reproduce the candidates’ names in large
hold face type; naught is mentioned abeut qualifications, pro-
grams or issues at all. Election posters: fundamentally are
the equivalent of wedding or graduatiow notices ; they inform
the unknowing populace that “Hey, looka here, I'm running!”
So what?. Judging from these phenomena surrounding the
9 x 12 sheets of paper, what good-are-the things at all.

This is what the Student Executive Committee wondered.
The EC attempted to curtail the unsightly eye pollution by
establishing a ceiling for candidate spending: An existing
limit of $25 has not solved the eye sore-of blossoming posters.
According to a University Journalism Press employee, $25
will buy about 1000 posters. That is not much of a limitation,
Therefore the monetary. ceiling is not the key.

A more sensible approach would be to ban posters, The
LC could casityaccemplish the task, althoughthe group would
certainly be weeusing itself of wrongdoing, after the fact, if it
banned posters. Remember, all the EC members were cand-
idates at one stime, gusta few months ago. But at least be
thankfel for one blessing—the Interfraternity Couneil abo-
lished posters during its March elections. Consider how much
more hideous the campus would have appeared-with another

1000 posters.

On Recent Championship

A championship. was deld in Doremus Gymnasium not
long ago. That championship was not the NCAA College
Swimming and Diving Championships. Rather in this cham-
pionship the Jayeces erushed Pres Brown's 37-30. The league
was Lexington’s Little League basketball. organization,

The championship, and andoubtedly the whole season,
went almost without avtice by W&L students. The young.
sters fought it out early every Saturday morning in Doremus
while the college folks were customarily recovering from
hang-overs or five days of 8 o'clockclasses, It was a nice thing
for the sehool to do for the comnmnity, and it becomes even
nicer when you consider it was done without any thought of

recognition,

W@L: Where It Has Been, Where It Is Going...

Community. Involvement Examined

Ken Lane is Director of the Uni-
versity Center. He is a W&L alum-
nus, who served as Editor-in-chief
of the Ring-tum Phi.

BY KEN LANE

A feature of Washington and
Lee that is broad, complex, and

often ignored is the relationship be-
tween the University and the region
—Lexington and Rookbridge Goun-
ty—whieh surrounds it.

The subject is vast because there
are so many levels, some more sub-
tle than others, at which that re-
lationship exists. It is an easily
ignored subject because many, edu-
cators and students alike, view a
university as a_ self-contained and
independent entity, with its aims
and functions remaining internal
and unrelated to the environment
around it.

Traditionally, a university is sep-
arated from the rest of society by a
wall (which, for example, explains
the derivation of words like “intra-
mural” meaning “within the wall,”
i.e. within the university). Yet, es-
pecially today, universities inevit-
ably influence their environment,
and affect the social structure, if
not the lifestyle, of the communi-
ties where they are located. This
would above all be true of a univer-
sity such as ours which is situated
in a small town in a predominantly
rural setting.

That Washington and Lee has a
wall which divides town from gown
should not take much convincing,
even though that wall is not physi-
cal or always that visible. At the
same time, not all walls are inher-
ently evil and some are, in fact nec-
essary for survival. For example,
we are by definition a private, not a
public, institution, We are thereby
bound in certain ways in terms of
how we can apply our money and
resources; we are not an institution
for “public use.”

In other ways, however, walls
between the University and its sur-
rounding community, walls that are
not so necessary, are becoming less
distinet. Over half of the Univer-
sity’s 1600 students live in rooms,
aparuments,..or houses off- campus.
Of the total of 862 students living
off-campus, most (578) live in Lex-
ington; the rest (284) live in the
county.

Students are also an integral part
of the local economy. There is little
doubt that many businesses and res-
taurants would not exist without
students as customers. Moreover,
some students have joined the ranks
of merchants, Last fall, several stu-
dents began operating their own
filling station in town, Several weeks
ago, four students opened a new re-
tail store, the “Oz,” on Main Street.

The most significant area, how-
ever, where | see University “walls”
coming down lies in the newly
emerging trends of student volun-
teer service, This is the area which
| would like to examine in the re-
maining part of this article.

a year-round recrea- ..

Another illustration of a signifi- -

cant breakthrough in the area of
community service has been the for-
mation of Reach-Out, a community

- problem center for the ‘Lexington-

Rockbridge area, This project came
about as the result of a joint effort
of townspeople and students,

Reach-Out originated in October,
1970, when several students con-
cerned about the increase«in local
drug abuse met witha number of
community leaders to discuss the
need for drug education and a drug
crisis center. During the next-twelve
months, a planning group of stu-
dents and local residents met regu-
larly to move towards setting. up a
center that would help meet these
needs. The size of the group varied
between
with much turnover in membership,
but by the following summer (1971),
the center, called Reach-Out,. be-
came incorporated and things be-
gan to fall in place .

V.M.I. donated an old abandon-
ed house on Main St. which would
house the center. Washington and

Lee donated building supplies. Stu-»
alike ©

dents and local residents
chipped in to help renovate the
house and put in plumbing and
electrical wiring. Other residents
donated furnishings and money: Gas
heaters were installed, and by Oc-
tober of last fall, the house was
ready for use.

The requirement for all volun-
teers was that they undergo: an in-

tensive two-week training program ©

that included courses on commun-
ity and interpersonal problems, the
physiology and psychology of drug
and alcohol abuse, first aid, and
counseling techniques. Two train-
ing cycles were held early. in the
fall, and on November 1, 1971,
Reach-Out opened with two tele-
phones and a full staff of some
thirty trained volunteers.

From opening day, Reach-Out
has operated on a twenty-four hour
a day, seven days a week basis. Two
volunteers are on duty at any given
time, with the average weekly shift
for cach volunteer being six to eight
hours,

Though some days are busier than
others, the center has been active
in its first five months of operation.
Since part of the subsidy comes from
a Federal grant, the staff keeps ac-

contacts, Le. the number of times
calls or visits are made te Reach-

(All information of a personal na-

considered to be “significant..con-
tacts”, that is, instances when a per-
son -visits or telephones  specific-
ally for the purpose of seeking help,

The majority of Reach-Out’s calls
for help have been related to pover-

ty, rather than to drug abuse. As a>»

result, the center has an extensive

list of community agencies to which =

they can refer people. Some ongoing

work -nevertheless has to do with
drug-related problemsy-The'type of
cases ranges froma caller seeking
general information ao someone
coming in who is suffering from a
serious overdose.

At present, of some _ forty-five
volunteers on the Reach-Out staff,
fifteen are Washington and Lee stu-
dents. Several others are wives of

_ students or of faculty members.

Legal: Aid

Another «significant..arca of stu-
dent voluntcereservice is the egal
Aid Association of the aaw School.
The organization is comprised of
seventy-five second «and third-year
law students, with a student -presi-
dent, John Wolf, andra faculty ad-
viser, Professor Lawrence ‘Gaughan
of the daw Sehook.

Authorized +y the Buena Vista-
Rockbridge Bar Assdciation, the vol-
unteers man-a Legal «Aid “Office in
the Court Howse~square in Lexing-
ton. The officeserves low-income
area residente-whoeannet afford a
lawyer. The standard is based on
$3000 or less annual income for a
family of four, even if the family is
not on welfare. Standards. are pro-
portionately lower or higher for
larger or smaller families.

The student volunteer sereens ap-
plicants for Legak,Aid> to determine
their eligibility, then assigns each
qualifying applicant to a lawyer,
There are a total of sixteen sareas
lawyers who voluntece theireservices
on a rotating» basis,

A law student in the Legal Aid
program is chosen to assist the law-
yer when aecase-assiganaentds made.
If atthesized by the lawyer he is
helping, the velumteer may do what-
ever a practioing- lawyer is entitled
to do in carrying out his case re-
search, For example,»he has access
to many files and other information
otherwise! considered ‘o¢onfidcatial.
However, the voluntcer may not ap-
pear in court as the client's kawyer.

Almost all of the eases handled
through Legal Aid are either seri-

ous misdemeanors or civil suits, such

as cases involving bill collection,
welfare, social security, and divorce,
The Legal Aid Assosiation was

stanted in 1966, but only in the last -

couple of years has it begun to ex-
pand significantly. For example, the
number of volunteers rose from
twenty last year to seventy-five dur-
ing the current year.

A new Legal Aid office opened
this past winter in Staunton, serving
residents of that city and .Augusta
County. The office is staffed by stu-
dents from the School of Law, as-
sisted by jonior and senior students
from Mary. Baldwin College.

This coming summer, a Legal
Aid office will open in Harrison-
burg, to be staffed by our law stu-
dents. According 10 Legal Aid ad-
visor, Professor Gaughan, a pro-
posal is being submitted to the local
bar 4 permit expansion of our
Legal .Aid services to cover the en-
tire five counties of the Sixth Fed-

®

eral Planning District; in which we
are located, Along with that expan-
sion, Gaughan added, he would like
to begin to recruit undergraduate
students to assist in the program.

University Federation

A third and final new area of
significamt student volunteer serv-
ice is the work of the student organi-
zation, the University ..Federation.
This is a community service group
currently. under the office of the
University Chaplain. Although the
organization is a descendent of the
University .Ohnistian «Association, it
is today a secular group, sponsor-
ing no feligious activities as such,
Its main function is to coordinate
and channel studeat) voluateers,.into
new -SeTVice.. projects... “-

The Federation-ourrently has five
operating: programs: the .Big Broth-
er-Big Sister program, the Tutoring
program,» the Children’s Winter
Clothing Drive; weekly student aid
visits to Western State, Mental, Hos-
pital in Stawaton; and: monthly stu-
dent. aid visits to Chatham Nursing
Home in Chatham, Virginia.

The’ Federation has a total volun-
teer force of some forty-five Wash-
ington and Lee students; Also, ten
volunteers from Southern Semin-
ary are working in both the Big-
Brother-Big Sister Program and the
Tutoring Program. A couple of vol-
unteers from Lexingten High.School
have joined. the Western State Pro-
gram.

By far the two. strongest pro-
grams, the Tutoring and Big Broth-
er projects, have. developed. within
the hast year. »

Starting bast fall, the Tutoring
program is the newest~ and most
popular of the programs. Last .se-
vester, the Federation placed sev-
enteen volunteers in Central Elc-
mentary Scheel.- Six were from
Waskington and. Lee; eleven from
Southern Seminary, This semester.
there are twenty-two volunteer tu-
tors at Central who are Washington

» and bee students.«Some tutors. are
on a, one-to-one basis; other tutors |

are given an entire section of a
class. The program requires a com-
mitment of at least one hour a
week from each volunteer.

”

The other major project, the Big. -

Brother-Big Sister Program, has ten
Washington and Lee students and
two Southern Seminary students.
Each volunteer is matched with a
child who is informally “adopted”
as a little “brother (or sister). The
local welfare and probation depat-
mentseseleet the children who are
little brother candidates. Each de-
partment also matches the volun-
teer with the little brother, and each
big brother is given an adviser from
the referral agency who is person-
ally with the child, The volunteer is
assigned to visit with his little
brother at least three hours a week.

In The Future

In response to the rising new in-
terest in volunteer service, the Uni-
versity has plans next year for an
administrative office through which
students can be channeled into com-
munity service projects. The nucleus
for the new organization is this
year’s University Federation, | have
been appointed by the University as
Executive Director of the organiza-
tion along with my job as Univer-
sity Center Director. The Volunteer
Office will operate out of the Uni-
versity Center Office and several
students on the University’s work

EES: 28

BY W. PATRICK HINELY

Page 15 of the new catalog says
“the Washington and Lee campus is
renowned for its beauty and charm.”
Whoever wrote that didn't take into
account certain exceptions, such as
the time preceding student “gov-
ernment” elections.

It is ironic that students make
such strong accusations about credi-
bility gaps in the recruitment-orient-
cd catalog, saying that the book
covers up shortcomings of the Uni-
versity, In some oases, the students
are completely right. In most, there
are various shades of gray none of
us can really sort out, but in the
case of the election posters which
have blanketed our campus, we stu-
dents have the writers of the cata-
log to thank for not telling the story
like it really is. It would run some-
thing like this:

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Student government at W&L is
basically a shallow and disor-
ganized organization. But like
everything else at W&L, it is
unique. It has so much power
that it transforms the campus
several times every year, Be-
fore elections, which are in-
geniously timed and arranged to
keep the same cadre of people
in office, candidates for all its
superfluous offices change the
campus to resemble Wall Street
during a parade in which not
only ticker tape, but also larg-
er and more obnoxious pieces
of paper flap about in the
breezes which waft through
lovely Lexington, and cover
the beautiful, tree-shaded cam-
pus like snow, only more color-
fully and in a much more taw-
dry manner. What is indeed un-
fortunate about these student-
created phenomena is that un-
like snow, they don't melt.
They must be picked up (or
off) or else will continue to be
eyesores for weeks.

It isn’t enough that the posters
should be so prolific, not only on
buildings, which is the lesser crime,
for buildings are man-made, but
the sacred domain of nature has
been invaded. If trees could scream
for every staple or tack driven into
them for the inane purpose of hold-
ing up campaign posters, classes on
the hill would have to be cancelled.

Through A Spyglass Darkly...

Blows Against The Empire...
' Student Government

 

&
Earmufls would be needed for pro-
tection from the noise, regardless of
the temperature.

I'm not saying every candidate
should hire an artist to design his
posters,

What I'm saying is that the stu-
dent “government” should at least
be responsible enough to control
such periodic thrashings of the cam-
pus, If our “leaders” can tear them-
selves away from such top-level de-
cisions as what kind of booze to
buy for the next cocktail party,
they might take enough time to ap-
propriate a comparatively small
sum of OUR money to purchase a
few bulletin boards, which could be
placed at prime advertising loca-
tions around campus, on which and
ONLY on which candidates for of-
fice would be allowed to display
their propoganda,

Or there is an alternative plan.
Pass a rule requiring all candidates
to have their campaign literature
printed on rolls of tissue paper,
which would be placed at their
obvious logical locations around
campus. This plan has the most
advantages, since it assures com-
plete saturation of the student
body, probably within 24 hours, It
is also a more effective means of
advertising, because surveys have
shown that people would much
rather get something free that they
can USE than something they can
only look at.

Of course, there is a third alter-
native, and one which is most likely
to be followed by our student “gov-
ernment.” That is to do nothing.

If that is the case, the administra-
tion could justifiably interefer in
student affairs and place _restric-
tions on ALL student originated pos-
ters. Sooner or later, this would in-
terfere with First Amendment rights
of free expression.

Then the question would be one
of free expression vs. controlled ex-
pression. If the student “govern-
ment” would make a move to regu-
late ITSELF—not to regulate the
students as a whole, but to control
THEMSELVES—then maybe stu-
dents and administration alike
would come to look at them as more
than a Mickey Mouse operation .

Talk to your “officers” about it.
At least you'll find out who they
are.

 

On The Referendun

BY MARC SMALL

The commotion from the coeduca-
tion referendum has died, and the
results have become a part of cam-
pus history. Many of us were shock-
ed: memories of the Freak Week
vote and of the straw vote on the
coed issue held three years ago ran
deep, and it became almost a cliche
to state emphatically #hat the results
were decided even before the vote
was taken. Yet, even the heavy turn-
out worked agaifst the reformers,
the fraternities poured forth in
considerable strength, and another
nail in the gallows on which the
University was to be hung has been
thankfully bent beyond use.

lt is obvious that the vote was
not overly importam, for the final
decision is in the hands of the
Trustees, a body that has in the
past displayed a streak of individual-
ism and a willingness to fight to pre-
serve the Washington and Lee they

study program will assist in the run
ning of the organization.

A student director will work with
me, along with a core group of the
students who are chairmen of the
different projects, In addition to
continuing and reinforcing the pro-
jeots already in existence, the Volun-
icer Office will be working with
various community agencies in an
effort to develop new service pro-
jeols,

A strong recruiiment drive is
planned for next fall, Sign-up sheets
will be available to students when
they go through the registration line
The Volunteer Office will then place
volunteers according to their inter
ests and act as a liaison between
the volunteers and the cooperating
agencies, providing a structure for
on-going training and evaluation.

Hopefully, the three developments
discussed above, Reach-Out, Legal
Aid, and the University Federation
Office, are trends of further break-
throughs between the University and
the community, Both worlds, the
campus and the community, have
much te offer each other in the
way of enrichment and broadening

perspectives

think should exist. Hf the vote had
gone the other way, it would not
have meant immediate action now
or in the near future—but it would
have meant one more argument in
the hands of those who have worked
tirelessly and dynamically to bring
females into the student body of
this University, As it turned out, the
unwillingness of the students them-
selves to sacrifice a beneficial facet
of student life, coupled with faculty
and administration opposition to the
change, may well keep Washington
and Lee in its present state for some
time.

lt is hard to deny that the admis-
sion of women as degree candidates
appears at this time to be inevit-
able, since the fadishness of the
concept will soon erode any sirong
academic opposition to the idea,
Professorial types tend to be incred-
ibly vulnerable toward favoring
whatever Yale, Harvard and the
other Ivy League schools adopt.
ed as the cause celebre of the
month. Unless the coeducation issue
should miracubously become defused
through some presently unseen ac-
tion from om high, then within a
decade this school will be unable to
resist the pressures of maintaining
our face with other schools, and
will fall prey to the subtle inanities
of “keeping up with the Joneses.”

Men of Washington and Lee, you
amazed me, The vote was close—
but for once the urge to be “in” ap-
pears to have been overcome by
common sense and the realization
that this school can only continue
to offer its particular benefits as long
as certain standards are maintained
Yot, the victory is in many respects
a hollow one, since H will have but
a temporary effect in stopping thove
who see the future of Washington
and Lee in becoming but, as one
student said, “another drop in a
large and exceedingly drab bucket.’
lt will be only through hard effort
and constant reminders to the fac-
why and administration of all-male
sentiment that we can continue to
provide here a place for those who
wish the unique privileges accrued
by attending a school with the cour
age to stand out from the crowd
and speak loudly with the voice of
individualism and conviction

 

 

Article Tells of Black Alumnus

The Washington Star, in its Week-
ender magazine of February 19,
1972, printed an article about John
Chavis, a nineteenth century Negro
educator and Presbyterian minister.
The article by George Reasons and
Sam Patrick relates that Chavis was
born free in 1763 in North Caro-
line, served as a soldier in the
American Revolution, and later be-
came a minister and teacher in
Orange County, North Carolina.

The most interesting thing about
Chavis, however, is that part of his
education was obtained at Wash-
ington Academy, now Washington
and Lee University. The Reasons

and Patrick article gives no dates
for his attendance here, but Dr.
Ollinger Crenshaw, in his book,
General Lee’s College, mentions
Chavis as having been here in 1795,
and the Washington and Lee Alum-
ni Directory lists Chavis as having
attended for eleven years, from
1789 until 1800.

It is not certain whether or not
Chavis was the only Negro to at-
tend Washington and Lee before
the twentieth century (some evidence
indicates he was not), but, never-
theless, the Chavis story brings to
light one aspect of W&L history un-
known to most people connected
with the University.

THE RING-TUM PHI

  

BY LEX McMILLAN

I ran into a friend at the bakery
last Saturday and after I had helped
him pick up his sweet rolls from the
floor | began to consider his situa-
tion. He graduated last year and
after a brief absence returned to
Lexington for what appeared to be
an extended stay. He is only one of
many who apparently has experienc-
ed what I would call the “revolu-
tion of falling expectations.” It is
what Charles Reich would call a
manifestation of Consciousness III;
the beginning of the greening of
America.

It is a widely observed pheno-
menon and a very curious one. One
of the major ‘interest’ magazines
recently had a cover story on Ivy
League grads who were doing man-
val labor, blue-collar work, etc.

What is causing this “revolution
of falling expectations” and what
kind of results is it going to have?

One widely supported explanation
is a search for ‘meaningful’ work
(I think ‘meaningful’ has replaced
‘relevant’ in the terminology of the
beautiful people; far out. . . etc.).
It is this idea that really interests
me. Though the terminology reeks
of rhetoric it still appears that many
seek ‘meaningful’ work in a very
sincere way. Undoubtedly there are
other explanations for the “revolu-
tion of falling expectations,” some
noble, some not so noble, For in-
stance, two such polar examples
might be first, a rejection of the ma-
terialistic rapaciousness which has
characterized this country in the
past and secondly, emotional imma-
turity characterized by a fear of as-
suming the responsibilities of an
upper-middle class adult. It is signi-
ficant that this ‘revolution’ is more
commonly observed in the ranks of
the the affluent than among the
sons of blue-collar workers. They've
seen their fathers doing ‘meaning-

“Letting Go”

Page 3

 

ful’ work for years and they view
a willful plunge in this direction
with some degree of disbelief. That
‘9-5 grind’ probably sounds pretty
good in contrast to a 7-4 job fol-
lowed by a 5-11 p.m. moonlight
job necessary to keep body and soul
together,

A rude shock may be encounter-
ed by these scekers of meaningful-
ness after they have so immersed
themselves in the blue-collar world
that they cannot escape. Of course
it is entirely possible that an indi-
vidual with a prep school, Ivy Lea-
gue, 125 plus 1.Q. background will
be happy house-painting, doing car-
pentry or working on automobile
engines. It is possible, but not prob-
able.

Reich and many of the ones who
have a so-called ‘green conscious-
ness’ would have us believe that the
rejection of materialism and search
for ‘meaningful work’ is an all-per-
vasive phenomenon cutting across
class lines, I think they are wrong.
However, it is a rather pervasive
characteristic of the affluent young
and it is because of this that there
will very likely be a trade-off which
will have a profound effect on our
society. The upper-middle class
seekers for meaningfulness will
move down and the sons of blue-
collar workers who already know
what meaningfulness means will
move up. Neat, yes?

Actually I think that the greening
of America will not have this sort
of effect. At best, the enlightened
young upper-middle class will move
into the same allegedly meaningless
jobs but with a less materialistic
viewpoint. Remember. this is at
best; at worst, Consciousness Ill
was a figment of Charlie Reich's
imagination.

All I can say is that, when these
seckers of ‘meaningfulness’ have re-

Letters To The Editor...

Privacy Invaded

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

The recent removal of parietals
seems to have worked satisfactorily.
WAL gentlemen are now given the
convenience of attending to the
comforts of their guests overnight.

Recently, however, parictals have
backfired on me. It seems that the
sanctity of my room in the old
freshman dorm, often referred to as
the zoo, has been broken. I have in
recent nights awakened to a steady
crunching sound emitted from the
walls of my room.

Realizing that restrictions concern-
ing overnight visitation by human
life have been done away with, |
wish that the proper University of-
ficials would institute some form of
reguhations concerning the presence
of other life forms . . . mainly in-
sects.

Help! My room has been invaded
by termites!
David Canto ‘75

Actions Criticized

lo the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

At a recent intramural basketball
game | was amazed by the actions
of some of our black students who
we played . Perhaps “amaz-
ed” is not the proper word. In fac
the attitudes of these “ es” is
that attitude which we white stu-
dents have come to expect. When
they have to. use a basketball game
io create issues for their plastic
radicalism, just to keep up with the
“cause,” and manufacture problems
that some of their “brothers” are
really experiencing, then perhaps
segregation is the only real solution
acceptable to them (aside from black
supremacy), Equality in its true
sense will never be reached when
the slightest conversation is con-
strued as an act of white aggression,
and then in complete “innocence”
the black “victim” hides behind his
three hundred years of slavery,

Since one cannot talk to these
individuals as equals then perhaps
members of this small sampling (
trust Ht is a small sampling) will
consent to respond with a letter to
the editor, Perhaps my impressions
are wrong, but they are recurring

Chris I Lundgren 74

Plea For Troubadours

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

After considerable time, | have
come to realize the full worth of
the effort, time, and mindy spent
on Alumni Association Busywortk
| have just received the latest bul
letin—a copy of the press release
eoncerning ‘President Huntley's
Founder's Day AQnnouttceemem. The
three singlespaced pages explain
im detail the University’s plans to

collect $36 million by 1976. The
various purposes for which the
money will be raised include the
gymnasium, renovation of MeCor-
mick, Tucker, and Newcomb Halls,
construction of ample student hous-
ing units, expansion of athletic faci-
lities, a program of general campus
improvement, and “restoration and
preservation of several pre-Civil War
homes and academic buildings on
Washington and Lee's historical
front campus.”

My concern is this: no mention
of any addition, renovation, preser-
vation of the Troubadour Theatre
was made. The number of students
served, the artistic involvement pro-
vided, the community enjoyment
delivered — all by the Theatre—are
sufficient, significant reasons for
such concern. The Commerce and
Law Schools, the Library, and the
gymnasium are of undoubted impor-
tance. lt seems valid to say that the
dramatic curriculum and its physical
vant are of equal importance to
those involved, Needless to say, i!
would be absurd to spend identical
amounts of money on the Theatre
and the Library. Proportional
amounts do seem rational.

Rufus T. Wright, ‘71

Changes Suggested

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

ht often requires a somewhat re-
moved view of a situation for a per-
son to openly express the feelings
of those in that situation, Jon
Swann’s letter in the past weck’s
Ring-tum Phi describing the dis-
courteous ejection of two black
children from Doremus Gymnasium
(while obviously her guests) appalled
many, but surprised few, for this is
the same type of treatment that most
students receive from Coach Miller
A simple change in one's schedule
causés this man to react with un-
qualified rage, To schedule the P.E.
course one desires for a later somes
ter may be beyond his understand
ing. To look unlike a WAL student
while using Doremus facilities may
bring attempted ejection in a man-
ner which is rude, at best, We think
that this indicates the gross inability
of Dick Miller to act appropriately
in situations dealing with WAL stu
dents, Were he in any other posi
tion, Professor Miller's inadequacies
might be easily overlooked, How
ever, as assistant athletic direotor
we find that he is constantly placed
in the position of reflecting what
one would wrongly believe to be
the collective attitude of Washing:
ton and Lee.

We suggest that a change in Couch
Miller's responsibilities is in order,
unless his manner should suddenly
become unusually subdued. at least
for him. This is not merely an om
nion of a few students, The gym be
longs to the students, not one man

W&L Lacrosse Wins |

First Three Games.

W&L’s lacresse team. began its
season this week. with three strong
wins, defeating ..Ohio, State 16-2,
Williams 20-5 and*Roanoke, 22-4.

Against Williams last Monday, the
Blue recovered from a. shaky. first
period and went on to win 20-5,

W&L, was. sloppy and inconsistent
on offense in the first, period, but

Doremus Liberation Front

BY ROB: “Lash’}, LaRue

Athletics, particularly . those , at
Washington and Lee, rarely get mix-
ed up in campus , politics; Indeed,
even at a national level, the «spon-
sors of sport have until recently
avoided smoke filled rooms of the
sort which.gharagterize Washington.
In the past, few years, though, Con-
gress, the dnternal Revenue Service,
and the Supreme, Gourt are. just a

few of the wheeler-dealers who have,,

shown a new, interesin athletics.
Just look at, the Gurt Flood case, the
AFL-NFL merger, the withdrawal
of the Senators from D.C,, and the
rumored consolidation of the two
pro basketball leagues,

Following the trendy W&L | stu-
dents are now experiencing an awak-
ening of interest. in. the school sports
program, The freshest example. of
this is the organization entitled.the

lective effort put together by Bob

E. Michigan Takes
NCAA College Team

Title In Swimming

Eastern Michigan University came
on strong on the last day to win the
NCAA College Division National
Swimming Championship last week-
end, It was the first NCAA swim-
ming meet Eastern Michigan has
ever entered,

The Hurons just joined the NCAA
this year, and next year hope to ad-
vance to University Division status.

Eastern Michigan trailed in fourth
plage after Thursday's events and
moved up to second after Friday's
activities. The leader both days was
the University of California at Ir-
vine, which had won the event the
last three years in a row,

Then on Saturday Bastern Michi-
gan scored big in all events, parti-
cularly in diving where they cap-
tured first, second and fifth places,
to run away from the rest of the
field. EMU ‘piled up 222 points. U.
Cal-Irvine and San Fernando Valley
tied for Second; each with 164
points. Other top finishers were
Springfield fourth with 150, South
Florida fifth with 143, Johns Hop-
kins sixth at 133, and Northern
Michigan seventh at 117.

Host -Washington and Lee had
qualified several individuals and a
relay team. for the national «meet,
but none made the finals and thus

W&L failed to score a point.

Individually, the outstanding
swimmers were U. Cal-Irvine’s Tom
Boughey and Johns Hopkins’ Bill
Milne, Boughey upset Milne in the
500-yard freestyle and also captured
two other firsts, the 400-yard indivi-
dual medley and the 1650-yard free-
style. Milne came back to take first
in the 200-yard and 100-yard but-
terfly events, Ricke Morehead of
South Florida won two events, the
200-yard individual medley and the
200-yard breaststroke.

Three new NCAA meet records
were set. Boughey shaved over four
seconds off the 400-yard individual
medley record with a 4:19.76 clock-
ing. Morehead’s time of 2:13.28 in
the 200-yard breaststroke was a new
record, as was Richard James’ time
of 1:59.60 in the 200-yard back-
stroke,

Boughey undoubtedly missed an-
other record when a mixup by an
official in the lap count caused him
to stop before he had completed the
1650-freestyle which involves 66
lengths of the pool, Boughey stop-
ped at the end of 64 lengths and
lost several seconds before realizing
he had two more laps to go. He still
swam the event in just 14% seconds
over the record,

The second -half..went better than

field. However, W&L could not
score while Ameriean U. scored a
penalty kick and a try just before
the game ended to win 14-6.

The “B” team proved to be more
interesting as the W&k second team
clearly dominated. the contest 16-
10. Lacking in personnel. some
members: of the 2A” scanmscrum
filled in on the..“B” scrum and
proved te be the winning advantage.
The scrum consistently got the ball
out to the backs and the W&L line
took advantage of their opportuni-
ties and moved the ball well. Two
fine scoring runs were made by
\lan Corwith and Rob Hessler. AU
couldn't seem to muster much of-
fense as Washington and Lee won
going away, 16-10. Scott Brown
scored on a long run just. before the
end. Cited for their outstanding
play were many of the WAL scrum-
mers who played both games:. Don
Gribble. Al McWhorter, Brian
Gregg and Steve Annand. The
team is now 2-2 for the season.

Today the W&L ruggers travel to
Sweetbriar to face an always strong

match will begin at 2:30. On Sat-

(Continued from page 1)
which is its lifeblood, we cam ef-

fectively prevent the Conspiracy
from achieving its goal, which we
call the Great Merger. So what we
want to do is get the United States
out of the UN, and to put all con-
ceivable, honorable pressure on the
federal government to get the UN
out of the United States.

Ring-tum Phi: Then, do you see the
President’s Ohina trip as patt of this
Conspiracy?

Melthaney: Yes, we do, and Mr.
Welch at the Council dinner was
asked this question and said, “We
see President Nixon's Ohina policy
and trip to China as an integral step
in the Conspiracy’s accomplishment
of establishing a world govenment
and we consider this as just possibly
the most disgraceful event or action
taken by a high level American offi-
cial, particularly a President, in the
history of the United States.” The
only thing we can think of to com-
pare with this was the determined
policy of General Eisenhower at the

of World War IL which was respon-
sible for the murder of between
two to five million anti-Communist
Eastern Europeans and Russians,
known as Operation Keel Haul—
but at that time Eisenhower was not
President, so Nixon’s betrayal of
Chiang Kai-Shek may be worse.
Ring-tum Phi: What was the sub-
stance of your talk earlier this
month before the Council dinner?
Mellhaney: Well, the emphasis at
the dinnet was the increasing acti-
vity of youth in the Society. |
opened the series of talks with a
brief presentation on the histori-
cal level, concerning the Conspiracy
which is approximately 260 years
old and has been working all that
time to destroy all traditional gov-
ermental systems, all religious and
moral codés and institutions and
out of the chaos, produce a one-
world dictatorship. I also spoke of
the present conflict in Ireland, and
also of some of the interesting foot-
prints of the Conspiracy which I
saw on my trip to the Soviet Union
in the suamer of 1969,

Over 100 years ago Negroes were
set free but without their share of
the country’s wealth they helped to
build. They had nothing to start off
with except their sweat and blood.
For the past century economic,
legal. cultural, educational and color
barriers have been placed in front
of them. Even an enlightened law
school such as Washington and Lee,
which turns out some of the most
outstanding lawyers in the country.
stood by in the 30's and allowed
a school system to be set up in Lex-
ington where there was a_ high
school for white youngsters and
none for Negroes, although it was
a single tax district.

Albeit Virginia Military Institute
and Washington and Lee have open-
ed their doors to Negroes, the bar-
riers will not be broken down until
the Negro can move into the main-
stream of American society. The
white public will have to understand
the Negro: what he has _ been
through, what he has been denied
and what are his expectations. The
“rap sessions” are a good attempt
at making this breakthrough but
what is needed most is an education
of the general public. Although
these sessions were opened to the
public, they were not well attended.

John Lalley scored on Bauer's

sistent pressure on the Buckeye’s

Slauson. Dave Warfield scored with
