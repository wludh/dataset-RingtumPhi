EC Amends Honor Trial Procedure;
Faculty Selects UC Representatives

the Executive Committee, at-
tempting to eliminate what was
termed as the “circus-like atmos
phere” of the public honor trial
procedure, put into action certain
crucial amendments which would

transform a public trial into less of
an adversary operation

The major change is that a de
fendant may no longer have “ad
vocates” (who have usually been
law students), but instead he will
have a counsel or advisor who may
not address the jury directly

Some observers have seen this as

a move to bolster the convicting
powers of the honor system. Bob
Brennan, next year’s EC president,

“if handled properly,
the defendant will have proper pro-
tection

however, said

In other university government
action, the faculty has elected nine
men to serve one-year terms on the

dent-faculty commitee with principal
jurisdiction in the field of student

OUTLOOK andREVIEW
On Cashing Student Checks

Up until now, W&L students have enjoyed an easy,
convenient arrangement with local merchants with regard to

 

cashing checks. But no more.

Late last year and early this year, signs began going up
in Lexington stores and restaurants declaring in bold letters:
“Checks Cashed For Amount of Purchase Only.” So far this
year, the Student Financial Relations (affectionally known,
as “Cold Check”) Committee has had to reimburse over 800
hounced checks, totaling more than $2000. These checks were
written by around 15 per cent of the student body, according
to information we received from the committee's chairman,
Chuck Lee.

This all-time record of financial irresponsibility on the
part of W&L men has thrown the Cold Check members and
the EC leadership into a minor panic. The problem is further
hampered by the continual failure of student violators to
appear before the committee when notified; hence, the com-
mittee’s money gets tied up in reimbursements for old checks
on which they can't seem to collect, and merchants become,
in the process, ever more reluctant to take a student's check.

As the old saying goes, something’s got to give. And the
consequences, if the situation worsens at the present rate,
could be disastrous. Some are already suggesting that the
Cold Check Committee, and hence all student protection, be
eliminated, And President Huntley himself, discussing this
problem with Bob Brennan, Steve Robinson, and Lee, sug-
gested the possibility that check cashing privileges might
eventually have to be suspended in university facilities. That
would mean no more check-cashing in the Co-op, in the
Cockpit, or the Bookstore.

As an immediate response, the Student Financial Relations
Committee has decided to cease purchasing all bad checks
written after May 10. This is approximately a week earlier
than usual. As plans stand at this time, however, the com-
mittee will resume normal operations in September.

Whether they will be allowed to continue throughout
next year without some drastic changes depends on the
students. This much is clear: the latent consequences of
continued student negligence are scary. And only those stu-
dents who have heretofore thought nothing of bouncing a
few checks can provide the essential remedy.

has recruited the personnel that has boosted the W&L record
to 11-2 each of the last two seasons. A second factor is the
team itself. While most students have been engulfed in the
“country club semester,” the squad has been hard at work
earning its top ten ranking. Instead of sauntering off to the
beach or elsewhere during spring break, the stickmen went
north to play more lacrosse games. Certainly a third influence
on the lacrosse success story has been the fans. Who can
forget the large, and enthusiastic (if slightly inebriated)
crowd that gave the Blue squad a_ standing

A Question of Morality

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:
On the very evening that a group
of concerned people gathered to
protest not only the immorality of
a certain war, but immorality in
general; on that very evening at
least one heart was deaf to the
message. He was a sad exception in
an otherwise sincere assemblage.

As the story goes, some careless
fool lost his wallet that night. Grate-
fully, the wallet was returned. Do
not get the fool wrong, now. He
sincerely thanks the returnee.

Still, considering the spirit of that
evening, he would also like to
express the hope that whoever it
was that lifted the small sum of
money from the wallet before it
was returned, did so with the inten-
tions of contributing to the cause
of morality.

As the story closes, be relieved
to know that all was not lost. The
unfortunate fool's draft card was
returned, untouched with the money-
less wallet. After all, who'd want
another one of those?

Bill Datz On The Prowl

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

a basketball, an album and cash

Daniel Named
All-American

By ROGER MUNSICK

It has been a balmy spring in-
deed for Washington and Lee's
athletic teams. After a frantic finish
against Virginia's Cavaliers last
Saturday, the lacrosse team, at long
last, received a coveted bid to the
NCAA championships. Even at this
writing, the baseball team, one of
three Generals squads to bring home
CAC titles from last weekend's
Spring Sports Festival, is itself seek-
ing an invitation to the NCAA reg-
ional tournament.

Aimost lost amidst these final
exciting weeks, however, has been
another significant athletic accomp-
lishment for the University, the
selection ef basketball captain Mike
Daniel, as an honorable mention

NCAA College Division squad and
as an Academic All-American on
the team chosen by College In
formation Directors. Washington and
Lee has produced only a handful
of basketball plavers who have
reached such a level of distinetion,
and Daniel's statisties alone qualify
him for this elite group. He played
four varsity scoring 1665
points for a 17 points per game
average, Though only 63°. he re
bounded at a career clip of 7.2 a

ought to start to proctor your tests
more closely because nowadays it
seems that gentlemen do cheat and

Those students who have gotten
away with honor violations in the

the ground afraid of possible
recognition. The word “trust” is not

“Letting

By LEX McMILLAN

One year ago this month “Letting
Go” first appeared in this paper.
The first line of that column was
the bold assertion: ‘the honor sys-
tem is dead.’ A year has passed and
the system has been discussed, studi-
ed, defended and attacked. It seems
appropriate at this time to re-
consider what was said a year ago.

In brief I asserted that the honor
system was a primitive and out-
moded structural survival which was
ineffectively persisting in a modern
bureaucratic society. | suggested
that the geographic, social and eco-
nomic diversity of the student body
was a hindrance to establishing a
consensus as to what honor is. In
view of these factors | suggested

that codification was the solution
for the salvation of the honor
system.

After a year of consideration it
appears that this evaluation was
somewhat shallow. Indeed, codifica-
tion and many measures of so-called
reform (such as a graduated pen-
alty) are fundamentally contradic-
tory to the ideals and the purpose
of the honor system. The very na-
ture of the system excludes half-way
measures and to proceed in such
a manner at this time would only
speed the sickness which now char-
acterizes the honor system and in-
sure its ultimate demise

In addition, | must say that the
pronouncement of the honor sys-
tem’s death was certainly premature
a year ago and, though an easy
and perhaps defensible assertion at
this time, it is still premature. We
can look around and. with a certain
focus, say with some justification
that the henor system no longer
functions here. However, there are

Snakes Sighted

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:
Anyone who has played tennis on
the clay courts has, at one time
or another, had the annoyance of
losing a tennis ball over the fence
in the tangle of weeds bordering
the courts on two sides. When one
is lucky enough to find the ball he
usually can’t avoid the briars and
the poison ivy. With the situation
already bad enough, there is now
a new added hazard—snakes.

still numerous students who are
completely dedicated to the system,
its ideals and purpose and to ignore
their determined existence, even
though perhaps a minority, would
be a failure to view the entire
spectrum of attitudes.

It appears that many students are
suffering from a failure of con-
viction. Many still nominally sup-
port the honor system but are un-
willing to see it enforced. The
spirit of tolerance which is pro-
moted by a liberal arts education
is certainly a benefit to man but to
carry tolerance to extremes involves
a severe loss of balance. The world
is not so diverse nor morality so
relative that honor cannot have
basic enduring absolutes. In fact,
once a society begins to refer to
honor or morality in purely rela-
tive terms it has opened the Pan-
dora’s Box of its own destruction.

Theft is dishonorable. To steal
from a thief is dishonorable. And
yel, we now allow the presence of
theft in this community. Our stu-
dent generation, represented by a
jury of twelve, has in fact endorsed
a form of theft. This does not mean
that honor is changing or evolving.
It means that honor is dying.

Regardless of the underlying
motivations, it is a fact that many
students do not support the honor
system. It is chiefly in this sense
that the system is dying. People
talk of the application of the honor

system to certain specific areas,
This is an indication of what is

There is an old but often mis

unimportant battles of the periphery
of an enemy's land, but, rather,

voluntarily picked up by a com-
munity dedicated to living the moral
life.

It appears that the honor system
is rapidly becoming a yoke rather
than a shield. It is time to recognize

this. C. 8. Lewis once noted that
there are two positions one can
take toward evil and both are

equally dangerous. One is to deny
its existence and the other is to be
attracted to it. It will insure the
death of the honor system if we
fail to realize the crisis that con
fronts us and act upon it.

The solution? | would no longer
say codification is called for be-
cause that would merely obfuscate
the issue. We don't speak of living
the honor system; we speak of liv-
ing under the honor system. The
distinction is crucial. It is unquest-
ionable that society needs systems
to preserve stability and order and
insure the safety of its members.
Thus, W&L also needs such a sys-
tem. However, it is blasphemous to
refer to a system of law as a system
of honor.

The time has come for each indi-
vidual to examine himself and de-
cide if he is truly dedicated to liv-
ing the honor system. If he is noi
then his voice should be heard. If a
majority of students no longer de-
sire to struggle for the ideals of our
honor system then we should drop
the pretense and cease to congratu-
late ourselves on having a com-
munity of trust. On the other hand,
if there are still many who are dedi-
cated to our honor system, then
those who do not feel capable of
meeting its requirements should
seck their education elsewhere.

It seems that we are rapidly ap-
proaching a crucial juncture. To go
on without a positive sense of
dedication and direction will result
in a system which functions in a
lopsided and paradoxical fashion,

Washington and Lee has long
been proud of the honor system.
It has had reason to be proud. Stu-

Baseball Squad
Wins Title,
Seeks NCAA

By DON McMILLAN

After a false start on Friday, May
12 the Generals’ baseball team was
finally able to open up its segment
of the CAC Baseball Tournament
the next morning, Saturday, May
13 at Southwestern. The team ar-
rived in Memphis with a 8-7 won-
lost record following consecutive
victories over Lynchburg College
and VMI earlier in the week. Their
first game was originally scheduled
for Friday morning, but after two
innings with the score tied 1-1 the
skies opened up and a steady down-
pour washed out the game.

The field at Southwestern was
finally ready for playing on at
10:00 a.m. Saturday morning and
so the Generals restarted their game
with Sewanee. Because of the rain
all remaining games had to be play-
ed on Saturday and they were
limited to 5 innings, the minimum
official playing time.

Grayson Fitzhugh took the mound
against Sewanee and picked up a
close 2-1 victory. Ellie Gutshall and
Dave Otey provided the timely hit-
ting which produced the needed
runs. Gutshall’s over the shoulder
catch in the last inning with the
tying run on second clinched the
win,

In the second game _ lefthander
Hal Jackson got the nod against
Centre and coasted to a 10-1 vic-
tory. Jackson was provided with a
very comfortable lead primarily due
to power hitting of Gutshall, who
had 2 doubles and a towering 4
bagger, and of Don Hathway,.

Going into the third game against
Washington University, the peren-
nial favorite, both W&L and WU
had identical 2-0 records. It was
clear from the outset that the winne:
of this game would at least have a
share of the championship, Rod
Ferrandino started for the Generals
as the home team’s pitcher.

From the first inning of the game
both teams threatened to score but
fine fielding especially by the Gen-
erals kept the game scoreless until
the bottom of the fifth. In the last
inning the loaded the bases
with a single by Hathway, a walk
to Gutshall and a fielder’s choice
by Doug Clelan. One out later
Coach Joe Lyles pulled his trump
card and sent Fitzhugh up to the
plate to pinch hit.

With the count of 2
strikes Fitzhugh pushed a ground
ball single through the right side of
the infield for the game winning
run. The final score was 1-0 and
gave the team a 3-0 record

Generals Grab ‘Big Bell’
For CAC Champtonship

Washington and Lee University’s
charter airplane was considerably
heavier returning last weekend from
Memphis, Tenn., where the Gen-
erals picked up a 300-pound bell,
symbolic of the College Athletic
Conference overall athletic champ-
ionship,

The W&L athletes also won three
smaller bells, for winning competi-
tion in golf, tennis, and baseball.
The W&L track team tied for third
place.

All the hardware was won during
the three-day Spring Sports Festival
staged by the conference at South-
western University. The big bell is
representative of the overall champ-
ionship following competition in
nine sports among the five con-
ference member schools,

In tennis, the Generals swept all
four opponents, beating Washington
University 7-1, and defeating Centre,
Sewanee and Southwestern by
identical 6-3 scores. Individual
champions were Marshall Washburn,
no, 5 for the Generals in singles,
lim Thompson in no. 4 singles,

Thompson and John Embrey in the
no. 2 doubles and Washburn and
Stan Taylor in the no. 3 doubles,

The W&L golf team won _ the
36-hole chamionship with a 598
total, four strokes under runner-up
and defending champion Sewanee’s
602. W&L’s Jack Marquess was the
medalist on the first day of competi-
tion with a 74.

In track, the Generals’ conference
champions were Robert Fallis in
the discus with a toss of 137-8,
Stu Nibley in the mile with a time
of 4:24.88 (a new W&L record),
and Steve Darsie in the 880 with
a 2:00.5 clocking. W&L compiled
45 points to tie Sewanee for third
place in the track meet, won by
Southwestern with 95 points. Wash-
ington University was second with
71,

For W&L it was their third over-
all championship since the confer-
ence was formed in 1962, the other
titles coming in 1967-68 and 1968-
69. Washington University has won
the title six times and Southwestern
once,

“Letting Go”

(Continued from Page 2)

dents have enjoyed the luxuries of
unlocked doors, unproctored exams,
and unguarded possessions, We have
perhaps taken for granted the in-
estimable compliment of being trust-
ed. It is difficult to imagine that
anyone would desire to sce the end
of these things.

A wise man once said the fol-
lowing to the members of his com-
munity:

It is not my business to pass

judgement on those outside, Of

those who are inside, you can
surely be the judges ‘

You must drive out this evil-

doer from among you.

This was St. Paul speaking to the
Church at Corinth but the wisdom
of his words is quite applicable to
our community here. We come to-
gether with the understanding that
we are all honorable men. In so
doing we implicitly place ourselves
in a position to be judged by tne
other members of the community.
fhe presence of honor is crucial to
the community. If we fail to en-
force our own code then we are
undermining the very base of the
Washington and Lee community
and are paving the way to mediv-

crity. No one likes to see men
kicked out of school, but surely we
don't want to see the end of our
community.

Individualism is essential to
complete personal development but
when an individual comes into a
community he must surrender sone
of his personal freedom for the
good of the community as a whole.
If you are offended by the implica-
tions of this column, then you have
failed to understand the value of
community honor and you don't
belong at Washington and Lee.
There is room for great diversity
and personal freedom at Washing-
ton and Lee but when the purely
selfish desires of the individual be-
gin to destroy the special treasure
of a community such as ours then
the community has the right and

the responsibility to remove this
influence.
Inevitably the individual must

surrender part of his personal frec-
dom to the group. If you think
the destruction of the honor system
will mean greater individuality, you
are mistaken. The alternative is a
community without trust, ordered
by a system of law rather than
honor; a system which is a yoke
rather than a shield,

game. With all due fairness to Fer-
randino both teams were more in-
terested in getting the necessary five
innings in before the twilight faded
for good. Southwestern scored 3
runs in the bottom of the fourth
inning and won 3-0,

This left the team with an over-
all 3-1 record, but Sewanee beat
Washington University 1-0 and this
gave the W&L team undisputed pos-
session of first place.

the Generals
were Ellie

Gutshall with a .S00 avg., Hathway

Daniel Named
All-American

(Continued from page 2)

ways. As Washington and Lee coach
Verne Canfield puts it. “Mike is an
outstanding young man in every
respect. We have had no player in
my years here, who has received
as much recognition, as many
honors, as Mike has, No player has
ever had more respect from his
teammates,”

The record would seem to bear
out Canfield’s assesment of the
esteem in which Daniel is held.
Twice, he has been chosen team
captain. A Dean's List student. he
was named an Academic All-
America at the close of the 1970-71
season, and elected to ODK here
at W&L last March. Twice, Daniel
was a member of the CAC all-
tournament team, and he was the
conference MVP after his junior
season,

Daniel who comes from Cincin-
nati, and who was recruited by a
service academy and an Ivy League
school, came to Washington and
Lee largely as a result of the Un'-
versity’s small college atmosphere.
“| liked the idea of a liberal aris
education,” he recalls, “I wanted
a math or physics major and the
classes were small. | also felt I
could play ball here. It was reall,
friendly—-a lot different from the
big city.” Reb Bauer, the Washing-
ton and Lee player who acted as
Daniel's guide during his visit, also
influenced the young prospect to
come to Lexington.

Looking back on his four years,
Daniel says he wouldn't change any-
thing if he had the chance. “There
have been a lot of challenges,” he
says, “a lot of competition, a lot of
feelings, even some hate.” He ai-
tributes his own success to his team-
mates, especially Doug Clelan, who
amassed many of his record assists
on feeds to Daniel for baskets.
Indeed, it has been team play that
has marked Daniel's years at Wash-
ington and Lee. “We don't have
better’ players,” he comments, “we
have better teams. Our schedules
are harder the next few years, but
we'll never have a loser as long as
Coach Canfield is around.”

Fresh off what he believes ha,
been an outstanding recruiting year
Canfield himself nonetheless admits
that a player, and more importantly.
an individual, of Daniel's caliber
will certainly be missed. “You don’t
replace a kid like that,” he states.
He's one of the best ballplayers
and captains I've had in fifteen years
of coaching. He's had to work,
he’s not a natural. But when the
ball is tossed up, Mike Daniel be-
comes a great ballplayer.”

 

Editor's Blasted

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

After reading John Robinson's
article on his impressions of the
mock convention, I find once again
that | must take my pen in hand,
Mr. Robinson's article might have
been better titled “mock impres-
sions,” especially when his com-
ments make it clear that he must
have been daydreaming up there in
the press box. The tenor of Mr.
Robinson's article was, to me, a
bit offensive; I don't care for that
kind of subtle snideness.

Perhaps I should enumerate what
was not only an attack but an
article fraught with blatant inac-
curacies. 1) Why Mr. Robinson has
such a low opinion of coats and
ties and General Lee, I'll never
know. But for some reason he seem-
ed to feel they were improper for
such an occasion, 2) The platform
was 42 planks, not 41, and there
was debate scheduled only on 20,
and there was not to be a roll call

vole o nevery plank, only those
petitioned,

3) | wonder if Mr. Robinson was
there during Senator Gravel’s

speech. He implies the Senator was
well received. | would say the dele-
gates were nothing short of rude.
4) There is nothing strange about
changing votes, especially in late:
ballots. 5) Mr. Robinson had no
experience on the floor to be able
to cal Ithe convention only remotely
educational—had he witnessed the
confusion that caused Massachusetts
to desert McGovern, the confused
challenges, the exasperation of a
floor organization, his comments
would surely have been different.
Having finished with Mr. Robin
son, | must take a turn at Skip
Paukert in the editorial column. |

“Our odds-on guess is that
Humphrey will once again be the
party’s standard bearer. While Mce-

our Mock Convention showed that
