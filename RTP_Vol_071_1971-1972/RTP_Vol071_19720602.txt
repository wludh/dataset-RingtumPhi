322 Students Get Degrees

Degrees were awarded to 322 stu-
dents in commencement exercises
yesterday. By tradition, President
Robert E. R. Huntley delivered the
principle address before a large as-
sembly of graduating students and
their families.

Degree totals included a_ juris
doctor for 60 students in the Law
School, and some 262 Bachelor
of arts or science degrees conferred
to senior undergraduates.

Activities began formaily on
Wednesday with the Baccalaureate
sermon, delivered by Dr. James
Graham Leyburn, who retires this
year after 25 years at Washington
and Lee, including ten as dean of
the university. Dr. Leyburn spoke
on “The Seventh Deadly Sin.”

Dr. Newton Thomas of Rich
mond, who also retires this year
from a 32-year teaching career at
Union Theological Seminary, pre-
sided at the service held in the
Evans Dining Hall.

Dr. Leyburn identified the seventh
deadly sin as that of sloth. “The
Greeks, as usual, had an excellent
word for it,” noted Leyburn.
“*Acedia’ adds to ‘sloth’ the con-
notiation of apathy, of heedlessness,
of not permitting oneself to feel the
kind of sympathy that leads to
action,”

“Do we see the loneliness of
those whose lives touch ours, the

1955 until he was named ninth
president of the institution in 1963,
the first alumnus to be elected.

 

misery and suffering and need, the
yearning for affection and reassur-

ance?” And if we see it, do we
give the personal response that
might relieve the distress of the

mind? If we do not, we have been
guilty of sloth; and true to its
insidious nature, that indulgence is
the first step toward allowing our-
selves not to perceive in any real
sense the need of people around us,
so that We may remain uninvolved.”

Leyburn asserted that the solution

to the pitfalls of laziness and
indolence lies in the meaning of
W&L’s own latin motto, Non

incautus futuri (translated, “not un-
mindful of the future’).

The American Dream, Leyburn
continued, “was the work of vigor-
ous and active men; and at its best
reflected a humanity, an essential
kindliness that lifted men’s hearts.”

“In recent years we have heard
that the American Dream is fad-
ing.” the sermon concluded, but “our
Dream will come to new life be-
cause of those who renounce the
comfortable lethargy of sloth and
stir up the gift that is in them,
because of all those who willingly
accept the call to be true men.”

Leyburn’s address was well-re-
ceived by the large crowd of stu-
dents and parents in attendance. He
had previously been named in the

|OUTLOOK and REVIEW.

Friday, June 2, 1972

A Welcome To The Freshmen

For many of you incoming freshmen, this copy of the
Ring-tum Phi may be one of your first contacts with upper-
class students at Washington and Lee. We would like to
welcome you to the university and hope that it lives up to
all your expectations,

 

Your is one of the largest freshmen classes ever to come
this way, numbering nearly 400. We imagine, therefore, that
those first hectic weeks of getting to know the school and
each other in September will be even more hectic than usual.
As a preliminary, we'd like to offer a few lines of advice culled
from our own past experiences,

Kirst of all, when you arrive you will be subjected to a
long, and sometimes tedious series of activies, known affect-
ionately as Freshman orientation. During the first days, you
will be herded en masse around the campus and out to the
Natural Bridge Hotel for a series of talks, presentations, and
discussions concerning all sorts of campus activities and
academic matters. While all of these programs will certainly
not interest you, pay attention as best you can. Particularly
important will be the day-and-a-half at Natural Bridge where
you will be able to ask questions of the dormitory counselors
who will be staying with you and where the Executive Com-
mittee wil be available to clear up any misunderstandings
you may have about the operation of the university's Honor
System,

As you know, the Honor System at Washington and Lee
is one of the most distinctive aspects of the university. Your
understanding of its scope, jurisdiction, and purpose is ab-
solutely essential to your future years as a W&L student,
for you will no doubt at some point encounter a case in
which a fellow student will be asked to leave the university
after conviction for an honor violation.

After orientation is out of the way, then comes Rush. It
is obvious to anyone who has kept up with W&L during
the past few years that fraternities have lost considerable
strength here. But nevertheless, they are still a vital part of
campus life, and you cannot afford to ignore them. We recom-
mend that every freshman, whether or not he plans to join
a house, go ahead and sign up for Rush. Though it may be
demanding, strenuous, and, at times, a little bit wild, fra-
ternity rush remains the best way we know of to meet upper-
classmen and get to know them during the opening weeks of
the semester. It is well worth your while, and there is plenty
of time during the rush period to decide which, if any house,
you think is right for you.

We look forward to seeing you in Lexington next fall
and hope you give some thought to these few words of
guidance before you arrive,

—N.ELP.

A Few Words of Gratitude

It is rare indeed for a man to serve just four years as
an administrator and, during so brief a tenure, to leave
such a large impression on his university as has William
McC, Schildt, Dean Sehildt has seen W&L pass through some
momentous changes—a revamped curriculum, a liberalization
of student social regulations, the inauguration of a bold, new
building program. And while this has happened, Bill Schildt
has been at the heart of the decision-making operations in
Washington Hall—as Associate Dean and Aeting Dean of
Students, as Associate Dean of Admissions, and as the co-
ordinator of Freshman Year.

Last month Dean Schildt resigned to take a new turn in
his fast-moving career, to join the law firm of Miles and
Stockbridge in Baltimore this August.

His decision to leave for corporate practice is certainly an
understandable one, but we cannot allow Bill Sehildt to slip
away without first expressing our thanks for his outstanding
service and dedication to Washington and Lee, Since growing
with W&L, first as an undergraduate, he has acquired a love
for the university which is immediately evident to anyone
who talks with him, After he graduated from the W&L Sehoo!
of Law (number one in his class) and joined the law faculty,
the question of how far Bill Schildt would be going became
a favorite topic for student speculation,

Most of all, Dill Schildt has gained the admiration and
respect of the dormitory counselors, who have been directly
responsible to him for handling all the problems of the first
year men, Faced with even the most delicate dilemmas. thes
have found Dean Sehildt to be a straightforward, fair-minded

advisor in all manner of affairs.

Fortunately, the university has found an able replacement
for Sechildt by appointing Financial Aid Direetor Hill Noell to
assume his duties, but may we register not only our thanks
to Bill Sehildt for the job he has done, but also our hopes that,
for the good of the university, he will remain associated with
WAL in the future

‘Serve Your Neighbor...’

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

I address this to all incoming
freshmen. Class of °76.

Thirty-eight miles north of Wash-
ington and Lee University is a
mental institution. For a number
of years, Washington and Lee has
supplied volunteers to work with
patients on a regular basis through-
out the school year. | am_ inviting
you to join our volunteer program.
The volunteers spend about two
hours in the hospital visiting and
another two hours in transportation
to and from the institution, Ideally,
the volunteer should visit on a
regular basis, either weekly or bi-
weekly. Progress with the patients
can be made much faster though if
the volunteer visits once a week
every week, In coming to Wash-
ington and Lee I hope you will
consider this opportunity to serve
your neighbor on a regular basis,

Finnell Attacks Woodruff
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

For the last two years, letters
from Stephen C, Woodruff, as he
brazenly signs himself, have ap-
peared with distressing frequency
in the Ring-tum Phi, their tone
bordering between forensic indigna-
tion and whining anxiety. His

vitriolic pen has touched heavily
upon all facets of human endeavor
and human nature, and his rasping
barbs of criticism have pierced the
tranquility of countless, hapless
students,

Stephen C. Woodruff’s latest line-
up of innocent victims, as witnessed
in the last issue, included Skip
Paukert, Brian Greg, Bert Meem,
John Robinson, and the Goose
Creek Symphony, God only knows
who else, in his rush to condemn,
Stephen C. Woodruff forgot to list

E. Lee, who Stephen C. Woodruff
seems to have adopted as his very
own patron saint.

In the aforementioned installment,
Stephen C. Woodruff pronounced
judgment on John Robinson for hav-
ing miscounted the number of
Mock Convention planks by one,
and for using a tone of “snideness”
that Stephen C, Woodruff, the self-
proclaimed master of nuance, found

 

Natural Food Shop Opens

By DON MARSHALL

Ever since ecology replaced Viet
Nam as the main topic for discus-
sion, people have become conscious
of the world around them. As a
direct result of this environmental
consciousness, natural foods have
become very popular.

Last year, Lexington saw it first
natural food store, offering an
ample selection of edibles relating to
microbiotic theory. The store closed
and, after a brief intermission, the
Shenandoah Valley Natural Food
Store has sprouted and started to
grow. The owners, Nancy and
Howard Ferguson. are extremely
friendly and very optimistic about
its success. Possessing a great deal
of experience with natural foods,
they decided to open the store when
they moved east from California.
Afier looking at different cities in
the area, they decided that the
Shenandoah region best suited their
life style.

Most people are unsure as to
what the terms organic and natural
really mean in relation to food.
Nancy explains that “organic foods
are those grown without sprays or
pesticides and also those grown on
soil built up through addition of
humus and organic fertilizers.
rather than artificial fertilizers.”

“These foods are better,” she con-
tinues, “because what you eat gives
your body benefits, (vitamins, min-
erals, etc.) instead of empty calories.
Most people are surprised at how
good natural foods really taste.”

The last statement is the hardest
thing to get across to those who
have never enjoyed the natural
flaver of these foods.

Although the store has been open
only two weeks, townspeople and
students, (many of them who were
originally just curiosity seekers)
have wandered into the shop and
enjoyed the friendly atmosphere.
Most beginners are cautious and
select a sampling of foods which
bear names similar to their custom-

arty favorites. Hence, peanut and

are popular choices. Once hooked

“a bit offensive.” That's just “a bit”
amusing, considering that Stephen
C, Woodruff’s writing has always
struck me as grossly offensive, and
his manner exceedingly offensive.
Ah, well. What is the antidete
for Stephen C. Woodruff’s misguid-
ed conscience and bombastic utter-
ings other than cotton for our ears?
Thank you for printing this. I
purposely waited until the Ring-tum
Phi's last issue to write, so that I
wouldn’t have to endure Stephen C,
Woodrufl’s irate rebuttal, knowing
that the best way to stop his fatuous
mouthings is to throw a protective
obstacle in his path: summer vaca-
tion.

Dress Criticized

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Having attended many athletic
events on the Washington and Lee
Campus since I was a student, I
have been most impressed by the
change in behavior and dress over
the years. After seeing the lacrosse
game with the University of Vir-
ginia, | am compelled to comment.

Just as dress and polite language
do not necessarily make the man,
neither do undress and obscene
language make the man.

Without making a value judgment
myself, I would like to remind stu-
denis at Washington and Lee of
a Maxim attributed to Aristotle, that
true virtue is placed at an equal
distance between the opposite vices.

Views Local
Vietnam Protest

Guest Column
By J. P. WOODLEY

The days of the Strike are over.
A new generation of W&L men has
come, students who don't even
remember the events of 1970 in
Lexington. Those who were here
remember with disgust the antics
which interferred with their aca-
demic pursuits in May cf 1970. The
events of the three weeks ago stand
in marked contrast to the frenzied
reaction to Cambodia, and a few
observations are in order concern-
ing the differences.

The hand-out which the antiwar
groups prepared and disiributed
reads more like something the Na-
tional Taxpayers’ Union would
come oul with than a peace mani-
festo. There was even a swat at
the national debi, that perrenial
target of right-wing abuse. The thing
was almost rational, indicating that
perhaps the antiwar forces have
learned a dangerous lesson, Another
feature which was missing was the
deliberate misspelling of “America”
as “Amerika.” | always thought that
one was kind of cute, but it seems
to have gone the way of all flesh.
A pily.

I have been told that in ‘70 the
protests didn't even get off the
ground until the studeni govern-
ment jumped on the bandwagon.
Fhis year the EC seemed to be act-
ing with more sense. Presideni
Robinson has gone on record ask-
ing people to write their congress-
men, of something like that. but no
consensis is available from the
body as yet. Opinion leaders, in the
end, are betier seen than heard,

The danger seems past, so we
can all breathe a sigh of relief,
But ii would be definitely in orde:

iO =OXPfess appreciation to the
organizers of the protest for its
orderly mature. The line between

eXereising one’s own First Amend-
ment fights and violating someone
else's is a thin one, but it was
scrupulously respected by everyone
concerned three weeks ago,

A Message to the New Students
COLLEGE TOWN SHOP

The traditions of Washington and Lee University require conven-
tional dress. Our shop, in keeping with these traditions, is desgned
solely for the W&XL man and features the natural
shoulder style prevailing on our campus

as well as the “shaped look”.

The correct appearance of both “on and off” campus is so very im-

portant throughout the school year .. .

Our long experience with W&L men enables us to soundly advise
and fill all your complete clothing requirements in the beginning

and throughout the school year.

You, as a student of W&L, hold the privilege of an open charge ac-
count, either billed direct to you or to your home, or both, whatever
the case may be. We hope you will make use of this and our many

other services.

 

We cordially invite your correspondence on particular apparel prob-
lems that you may have. You may be assured of our personal and

prompt attention to each and every inquiry made.

Daniel, McWhorter
Receive Top Awards

Mike Daniel, a senior from Cin-
cinnati, whose leadership qualities
on and off the basketball court
made him one of Washington and
Lee’s most honored competitors, has
been chosen W&L’s Most Valuable
Athlete for 1971-72.

Al McWhorter, of Montgomery,
Alabama, a veteran mainstay in the
Generals’ football line, was award-
ed the Wink Glasgow Award for
spirit and sportsmanship. Stu Nibley,
a rising sophomore and a student in

both basketball and track was
chosen Outstanding Freshman
Athlete.

They were presented their awards
during W&L’s annual Spring Sports
Barbecue, which winds up the
athletic year, In all, 199 monograms
and 112 numerals for participation
were presented to the 327 students

who took part in intercollegiate
athletics during the year. That repre-
sents nearly 25 per cent of the

overall undergraduate student body.

During the athletic year, W&L’s
11 varsity sports posted an overall
record of 93 victories against 71
defeats and one tie. Winning sea-
sons were posted by basketball
(17-9), golf (7-2), lacrosse (12-3),
tennis (13-7), track (4-3) and base-
ball (11-10), while the wrestling
team was even at 6-6-1. Conference
championships were won in basket-
ball, swimming, baseball, golf and
tennis, while lacrosse won the
South Atlantic Division title.

W&L won the overall champion-
ship in the College Athletic Confer-
ence, its third title since the con-
ference was founded in 1962.

Daniel, whose 1,665 points placed
him fourth on the all time Generals’
list, was a four-year letterman and
a two-time basketball captain. He
was three times an all CAC pick,
and twice received Academic All-
American honors, He was named an
Honorable mention College Division
All-American at the close of his
senior season.

MeWhorter was honored for the
dedication and inspirational quali-
ties he demonstrated during three
seasons of varsity football play.
Nibley, from Westgate, Maryland,
averaged 19.7 points per game for
the freshman basketball team, and
also set two track marks for Wash-
ington and Lee. In capturing indi-
vidual CAC title in the mile and
