BY JOHN ZINK
The Executive Committee — last
Monday discussed the up-coming
elections, the controversy over the
Cold Check Committee, and the
plans for a more thorough explana-

tion of the Honor Code to next
vear's Freshman Class, President
Steve Robinson announced — the

names of those persons who had at-
tained the required number of
signatures to be placed on the bal-
lot for the “Big Five” election to
be held next Monday,

The candidates are. for Presi-
dent; Robert Brennan, Rick Gray,
and John Runge; for Vice-President:
Robert Bruyere, Archer Frierson.
and Bill Merrill: for Secretary: Bill
Clark, and Lewis Powell; for Presi-
dent of the Fancy Dress Commit
tee’ Richard Jones. There were no
nominations for the Vice-President
of the Dance Board. Robinson also
announced that all candidates are to
turn in a list of their expenses by
6 p.m. on Sunday, March 5 in the
E.C, room. The failure to turn in
an expense list will result in the
eandidate’s name being dropped
from the ballot.

The campaign expenditure limit
was set at $25 by a motion pro-
posed by Senior Law Representative

Lock Handley at last week’s EC
meeting. At that time JoJo Mar-
tin. Senior Representative. noted

that a limitation “will bring equity
into the campaign costs.” When the
Handley motion came up for a vote
it was passed by a vote of six to
three.

The controversy which has arisen
over the duties and performance of
the Cold Check Committee was dis-
cussed this week. The Cold Check
Commitiee was called before the
EC in order to work out some of
the difficulties. Chuck Lee. chair-
man of the committee, outlined the
present situation. He said that so
far this year the cammittee has had
from $800 to $900 of bad checks

from about 400 students. Lee also

pointed to the fact that at the begin-
ning of the year, the local mer-
chants believed that the committee
had “folded”. The merchants then
stopped taking students’ checks.
Lee stated that the merchants are
again aware of the committee's ex-
istence; but the “local merchants

orandum circulated to chair-
men by the Mock Convention Cre-
dentials Committee member John
Gee that the Mock Convention
would have to solve problems in
delegate selection that the Demo
crais would not have to face until
July. According to Prof. David
Democratic officials have agreed on

Black Professor Speaks

BY PAUL LANCASTER

Dr .Alan Colon. Head of Black
Studies at Virginia State College,
called on blacks to help themselves
if they are to improve Black educa-
tion. His speech Monday night in
Lee Chapel opened the Student As-
soication for Black Unity’s first an-
nual “Black Culture Week” at
Washington and Lee.

Colon opened with “a basic real-
ity... that the black people are op-
pressed with respect to education

and that the education of the
oppressed cannot equal that of the
oppressors.”

He then presented a_ historical
overview of the “educational en-
slavement” of blacks. which began
with the inception of slavery. He
noted that “we've all been trained
io think that Africa is nothing but
sicaming jungles, This is a
poor stereotype.”

Colon suggested instances which

very

“facilitated the machinery of sla-
very. He mentioned laws which
prohibited slave education, based

on the belief that to keep a person
ignorant is to control him. Also.
sirong movements existed which at

Honor Study:

‘Weekly Report’

BY ARCHER FRIERSON
To date, the Honor System Study
Group has reported on its inter-
views of approximately 15 faculty
members and administrators here at
WL, has presented its conversa-
tion with the President of the U.Va.
Hones Council, and has made avail-
able to all students the opportunity
to fill out a special Honor System
questionnaire, the results of which
are now being tabulated. We are
now in the process of completing
the last and most important phase
of our study-—student . interviews;
and we wll have our conclusions
and recommendations made public
before final exams. In order to faci-
litate matters, we would like to en-
courage any student
be interviewed, make comments, or
ask questioas, to drop his name and
phone number in a box that will be
provided on the table located at the
front doors of the Student Center,
This week, two students with first-
hand knowledge of the Honor Sys-
tem, and particularly the procedu-
ral aspects of an honor hearing,
interviewed, The first student,
A, was accused cf a possible honor
violation earlier this year and was
acquitted by the EC at a private
Rearing. The seccad student, “5,”
was also accused of a possible
honor violation this year,
was found guilty by the EC at a pri-
vate but was acquitted by
a ‘tudent jury at a public hearing.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

March 1, 1972

Since Christmas, coed-mania has swept this campus like
an infectious plague. Every winter contemplation of this utopia
seems to be relapsing as the principal indoor sport. This sea-
son, the results are a bit more tangible than ever before.
Actually, the score is coeducationalists 3—~all-male chawvinis-
tic pigs 0.

Three diverse assemblages have endorsed a coeducational
future for Washington and Lee University. These bodies
were the Student Executive Committee, the University Coun-
cil (composed of faculty, students, and administrators) and
the Faculty Committee on Coeducation, The rationale of
this threefold endorsement centers on several arguments:
improving the academic stature of W&L, providing a more
wholesome and natural social environment, insuring an equal
opportunity for women and keeping current with the trends
at prestigious American institutions of higher learning, ¢.g.
Harvard, Princeton and Yale (which have all weleomed coeds
during recent semesters).

During Monday's Big Five Elections—-you, the students,
can make your stand on the issue of coeducation, The Stu-
dent Executive Committee has included on the ballot this
question, “Do you think coeducation is desirabe for Washing-
ton and Lee?” The results from this survey will generate a
concrete measurement of student sentiment on the issue.

Well, now the score is coeducationalists 3—all-male chau-
vinistic pigs 1. The Ring-tum Phi dissents. Coeducation should
not be allowed here; the two-century-old precept needs to be
maintained.

Initially, let it be known that there is no genuine, immmedi-
ate impetus for transforming W&L into a coeducational uni-
versity. Contrary to recent rumors, W&L is not a substand-
ard institution merely because females do not attend on a
regular basis. You may be pleased to hear that the quality of
education is improving here without the presence of women.
If you are unconvinced, investigate the projected consequences
of the $56 million development scheme which soundly pro-
vides for the future of W&L.

Coeducation will be expensive. The Report of the Com-
mittee on Coeducation made estimates of the pecuniary con-
sequences of admitting females. Four different plans were
provided with cost estimates. The total increase in yearly
deficit (amortization cost of capital investment over 20 years
at 81/4 per cent annual interest minus the change in annual
operating budget) ranges from $779,767 to $1,166,659. These
figures are based on November 1969 prices.

Coedueation will certainly affect the admissions picture.
According to Dean of Admissions, James Farrar, the number
of applicants is steadily rising. Coeducation in simple terms
means saying “NO” to more and more of these fine male ap-
plicants. Somebody has to go when an evalanche of women
arrive,

Coeducation infers an inflation in enrollment. The Faculty
Committee Report on Coeducation of 1970 continuously re-
ferred to a planned student body of about 2000. If W&L
swelled to that size, it would greatly endanger the university's
precept of remaining small by choice. Remember that Wash-
ington and Lee's enrollment has dilated from 1400 to 1600
in a fleeting four year period. The forthcoming School of Law,
when it is full, will boost the student population by another
100, making the total around 1700, Does W&L need more
students? One must be dubious. Size sparks the immense dan-
yer of sacrificing the Honor System. One crucial factor that
continues to make our code viable is the close-knit nature of
the student body. The more people that attend here conse-
quentially reduce that virtue of closeness, The expanded en-
rollment that seems to be a part and parcel of most coeduca-
tional schemes, poses a great threat to the maintenance of
the Honor System,

If you have ventured this far down this editorial column,
you have encountered enroute four motives for resisting co-
education, They are four seemingly logical justifications for
this paper's position on this primarily individual and emo-
tional issue,

ut the crux of this quandary is that coeducational en-
dorsements or rejections by students, student committees, stu-
dent referenda, or student publications are fundamentally
moot. Students will not resolve this controversy. Students
may vote unanimously in favor of eoeducation Monday; so
what? Think back to the most recent referendum on an im-
portant question facing W&L. It might be an ego-crusher
for undergraduates to recall the spring of 1970, when 85 per
cent of the voting students expressed a desire to shut the
school down. We are now on the verge of the spring of 1972
and W&L shows little intention, as of yet, to close its doors,
lhe lesson to be learned here is that students are virtually
powerless concerning coeducation.

If this theory of student subjugation in university deei-
sion-making can be accepted, one thing is clear, You can kiss
coedueation goodbye, until the gentlemen in Washington Hall
wholeheartedly support the idea, That is because they along
with the alumni-dominated trustees, run this place, not the
students, Lately, these people show no signs of embracing
coeducation as the savior of W&L, instead they seem quite
hestitant to even regard coeducation as one of the more
salient problems to be dealt with,

Oh yes, returning to W&L's greatest indoor sport. The
score? It has been updated to all-male chauvinistic pigs 5
coedueationalists 3.

1.W.R,

Elections Set For Monday

President

Bob Brennan

1 feel that the main issue in this
campaign is the Honor System, for
it is the president of the student
body who carries the main respon-
sibility for its continuance,

Having initiated the current study
of our Honor System, | have been
involved. in an examination of its
conceptual basis as well as. its pro-
cedural mechanism. My participa-
tion in this study has exposed me
to one particular area of the Sys-
tem where I believe its strength
and greatness lie: Over the past few
years, it seems that this area has
been de-emphasized—de-emphasized
to the point that the Honor System
is no longer respected and conse-
quently no longer effective.

My experience of the past sev-
eral weeks has reaffirmed nmty belief
that the Honor System under which
we, as members of the University,
live is in essence not intended as a
binding concept but a liberating one;
that is to say, what is important
about the system is that it works, not
because of a fear of what will hap-
pen to us if we cross the boundaries
which it sets, but rather that it fune-
tion as a concept which allows us a
greater sense of freedom in owt ac-
tions. The ultimate goal of the
Honor System is to create within our
community an atmosphere which
permits us to live without the aca-
demic or personal limitations which
exist in some communities in which
lying, cheating and stealing may not
be considered dishonorable. What
all this says is that I believe the
coneept of our Honor System is
valid—now, why isn’t it working?

In my opinion, there are two
basic reasons for the present inef-
feetiveness of the Honor System—a
lack of personal responsibility to the
system by those living under it and
a lack of a sense of community
among the members of the univer-
sity. | believe that both of these
problems can be overcome by a new
approach on the part of the Execu-
tive Committee in their presenta-
tion and handling of the Honor
System and by an attempt by that
body itself to generate the sense of
community needed to allow the sys-
tem to work,

My main coneern if elected presi-
dent of the student body will be to
see that steps are taken to accom-
plish these two goals so that we may
once again live in a community of
mutual trust and respect.

Rick Gray

I'm very fearful that the Honor
System has become the Honor Sys-
tem of the E.C. and not that of the
student body. I visualize an Honor
System with which every student
can identify and know that he can
influence those administering the
system. I would like to suggest:

1. having completely open F.C.

meetings

2. the posting of a summary of
the facts (excluding names) follow-
ing each honor trial (except where
the accused opts for a public trial)
and the verdict. This would inform
the student body of the workings
of the Honor System and it would
force the E.C. to be responsive to
student opinion.

3. completely revamping the pre-
sent public trial procedure in re-
gards to the process of jury selection
and the doing away with the E.C.
and defense councils, | advocate
having the jury consist of the first
12 names the computer picks who
do not know the accused and have
no pre-trial knowledge that would
prevent them from forming an ob-
jective decision, | believe the jury
ought to act as the E.C., question
the accused, and call any witnesses
it deems important and likewise the
accused could say anything he want-

ed and call any witnesses in his be-
half. | believe that this would in-
sure the best. interests of the ac-
cused and the Honor System in that
I feel under our present procedure
the councils divert attention from
the the issues and cloud the facts
with their presentations.

This year the E.C. has made many
mistakes from orientation to actual
honor hearings. These mistakes, in
my opinion, were not caused by a
lack of effort or desire, but by a
lack of experience. Next year is a
crucial year for the Honor System
and we can not afford to let the
same mistakes occur, thus I firmly
believe my experience will be a
great help.

I promise to do the best job |
possibly can and to give that job as
much time as it takes to get it done.

Vice-
President

Archer Frierson

It seems to me, as a candidate for
the office of Vice-President of the
Student Body, that the first and
foremost consideration in casting
one’s ballot for next year’s Execu-
tive Committeemen should be a
concern that twelve dedicated and
interested students be elected to in-
sure the proper implementation and
maintenance of the Honor System.
After serving this past year as a
representative to the E.C. from the
Junior Class, it has become my
staunch conviction that the work-
able preservation of the Honor Sys-
tem, subject only to the prevail-
ing sentiments of the student gen-
eration involved, is clearly the sin-
gle most important task of this body.
Certainly it is important and ex-
pected that these student representa-
tives express their views on current
topics such as coeducation, curri-
culum changes, future physical ex-
pansions of the university, and other
pressing concerns, and that specific-
ally in the case of the Vice-Presi-
dem, he be able to fulfill his two
chief duties: 1) advising a person
accused for an honor violation of
his rights, and, 2) managing accur-
ately the Central Student Body
Fund. But it is imperative, I be-
lieve, that these issues be met and
dealt with when they arise, that they
be basically secondary concerns,
and that the attention, time, and
energy of every E. C. member be
channeled primarily to a fundamen-
tal appreciation of the Honor Sys-
tem, tempered and directed by a
constant process of re-examining and
re-evaluating its application to our
lives here at W&L. So on Monday,
1 hope that you, after considering
these thoughts and weighing the
alternatives, will give me the oppor-
tunity to carry out this vitally im-
portant job.

Bill Merrill

The duties of the Vice-President
are, first, to fulfill the duties of the
President in his absence; second, to
manage disbursements of Student
Body Funds; and finally, to act as
the advisor to the accused in an
honor trial.

Sinee the first of these is basic-
ally that of a stand-in, | would like
to briefly address myself to the
problems attendant to the last two.

Through custom or tradition or a
combination of both, student body
funds have not been managed as
carefully as they should have been.
The rising costs of tuition and the
fact that Student Body Funds come
from an activities fee payable upon
registration make it imperative that
the fands not be wasted, but used to
serve the best interests of the stu-
dent body.

To insure that the maximum pos

sible benefit accrues to the student
body, all E. C. expenditures should
be itemized and tallied. This infor-
mation should be readily available
to all students.

Having served on the E.C. and
having been one of the founding
members of the current study group
on the Honor System, I believe that
| have acquired insights, experience
and an understanding of the Honor
System which will enable me to
better assist the accused in the event
of an honor trial.

The mutual trust and confidence
engendered by the Honor System
should also be applied to the accus-
ed, and the Vice-President should
be responsible for the assurance that
the accused enjoys the benefits of
the Honor System up until the time
that his guilt has been established.

An effective student government
requires the support of the student
body, so no matter whom you vote
for Monday, at least vote.

Secretary
Bill Clark

During my three years of enroll-
ment at Washington and Lee Uni-
versity, | have served as an assistant
to our Basketball team, a fraternity
Vice-President, and as a member
on the sophomore council in 1971,
| think it important that a junior
run for the office of Student Body
Secretary, if not for having three
years of experience in the Univer-
sity community, then because some-
one who is holding the office as a
senior has aspirations which are
solely for the betterment of the Uni-
versity and not for any future per-
sonal advancement.

As Student Body Secretary my
main concern aside from perform-
ing the functional duties that my of-
fice calls for, is with the Honor
System and with upholding it as it
now stands, I feel that there should
definitely be an Honor System at
Washington and Lee University but
this is not at all feasible if the sys-
tem is inflexible. Inflexibility has al-
ways crumbled under pressure. Con-
stant scrutiny of past and future
events concerning the Honor Sys-
tem should continually occur and
then, if necessary, relevant changes
should and must be made in order to
maintain the survival of a system
that will be an asset and not a detri-
ment to a working University com-
munity.

The primary function of the Exe-
cutive Committee is the mainten-
ance of Washington and Lee’s Hon-
or System. My candidacy for Stu-
dent Body Secretary is a result of
my growing concern for the vitality
of the Honor System. My concern is
twofold.

First, freshman orientation has
been sadly inadequate, Not only is
it important to make information
available to entering students, but

Black Focus

The New W&L

BY JOHNNY E. MORRISON

The turn of the sixties brought
about a change among the previous-
ly all-white institutions of higher
learning. This has caused some white
intellectuals and students to rejoice
because of this “new era” and some
to be the victims of “a back to nor-
maley” desire.

This new era is the presence of
Black students on formerly all-white
colleges and universities, When |
speak of back to normalcy, | am re-
ferring to those students who still
have their mothers’ and fathers’
sickness—the belief that white peo-
ple are superior and Blacks are in-
ferior, The purpose of this concise,
but provocative editorial is to ex-
pose the true experiences of a Black
student on a previously all-white and
now a predominately white campus
such as Washington and Lee Univer.
sity. This vis-a-vis essay will only
touch upon some of the things which
we Blacks encounter at Washington
and Lee.

1 will try to cause the reader to
use the mechanics of his intellect to
ponder upon the matter. My only
hope is that those who have never
gone through this experience do not
say “I know how you feel” because
that will be a lie beyond comprehen
sion. | think ut will be more ap-
propriate for you to say “I am in
sympathy with you.”

When one touches upon the social
aspects of the Black students, he
will find a consensus of “not too
good and sometimes very bother
some.” The following are responses

 

an active effort should be made to
disseminate this information to
freshmen, That the Honor System be
thoroughly understood is a necess-
ity, and a more vigorous orienta-
tion effort by the E.C. is essential to
this understanding.

Secondly I feel that more precau-
tions should be taken to ensure the
secrecy of E.C, investigations into
possible infractions of the Honor
Code. The possibility of an open
hearing makes this especially criti-
cal. For when secrecy is compro-
mised, students often come to the
open hearing already having decided
for themselves. The ill-effects of
such a situation are that open hear-
ings often degenerate into circus-
like trials full of Perry Mason
theatrics. Such trials stand in open
mockery to the letter and spirit of
the Honor System.

Should I be elected [ shall seek
an intensification of the E.C.’s
orientation effort. In addition to this
| would hope that open hearings are
returned to a proper level of honest
and sincere investigation.

| envision the 1973 Fancy Dress
as a Golden Marathon of Joy, un-
precedented in the history of W&L
Big Weekends. After great dedica-
tion and thought | have witnessed
the true vision of an epic festival of
entertainment. To help in the ful-
fillment of this vision, | shall distri-
bute a questionnaire to all the peo-
ple for a preference of entertain-
ment, dates, and locations for the
1973 Dance. | feel that current dis-
satisfaction over this year’s over-
crowded, underentertained Fancy
Dress, spiced with only 3.2 beer
can be greatly improved with the
aid of such a student poll,

I am decidedly in favor of an in-
formal theme party, without the
stilted formalities which have mark-
ed previous Fancy Dresses. If at all
feasible | will try to explore the
possibility of holding Fancy Dress
in the Spring with afternoon con-
certs with varied popular enter-
tainment on Wilson Field. Further,
| promise that the featured “Big
Name” entertainment will perform
for the majority of the Ball, rather
than be used merely as a “come-
on”,
| wish to utilize the spirit and
dress which marked student parti-
cipation in this year’s Fancy Dress
in the 1973 Dance. It is hoped that
the Student Poll proposed above
will help me produce a weekend in
keeping with the sentiments and
preferences of the whole student
body. It is my dsire to combine the
party spirit of previous Fancy
Dresses with the tastes and modes
of today’s students, Finally, I exhort

from some Black students to the
question, “How has social life been
at Washington and Lee University?”

Student I: “As far as getting down
to girls’ schools, it was difficult be-
cause no brother has a car, but you
could sometimes get a ride with a
white guy, On that angle, you never
knew when you had a date. In gen-
eral, social life was a day here be-
cutise this is where we are based at.”

Student Ik: “Miserable, unthink-
able, The most exciting things were
being turned away from a free con-
cert, kicked out of a fraternity's
open party and occasional encount-
ers with red-necks.”

Student Hk: “There is no social
life for a Black student. The geo-
graphical location of Washington
and Lee is geared for the middle and
upper-class white students who can
afford to get a car, | do net con
sider it a social life to sit around
and watch white guys have fun.”

The social life at Washington and
Lee has changed to a large degree
for the best. Now that Black students
see themselves as not only students
of Washington and Lee but also as
an integral part of the Black citi
zens of the communities, there are
more things to get invelved in and
more places to go. All of the Blacks
here agree in general that besides
being bogged down with arduous
study to make decent grades, playing
pool, going to a movie, playing bas-
hetball or sitting together talking
among ourselves. we are finding a
mich better soxial atmosphere he

Rebuttal On “Hazing”

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

In view of Mr. Sherman's re-
marks which appeared in this paper
last week, I feel somewhat. obligated
to offer a reply. Although I person-
ally feel that fraternities have much
to offer, | do not mean to appear
as an offended member of Phi Kap-
pa Sigma speaking out in blanket
praise of everything that fraternities

(Phi Kappa Sigma in particular) do.
Rather | hope that what I have. to
say will point out to Mr, Sherman
that he was wrong in trying to por-
tray some type of cruel and inhuman
treatment given to pledges on cam-
pus.

To begin with, if Mr. Sherman
feels that duck-walking across Jeff-

he has all my sympathy. Second, to

contracted pneumonia due to the
dousing they received, and again if
Mr. Sherman feels that this is ex-
tremely degrading then he is the
object of only pity from me,

To suggest that one could only
surmisey what took place after the
pledges entered the house is entire-
ly true. The point is that Mr, Sher-
man. did. not. have any idea of what
took. place and therefore had no
justification for trying to give the
impression that some type of harm-
ful treatment was administered to
the pledges once they entered. I
can assure him and everyone else
that nothing of the sort took place.

In. checking the records I have
found. that Mr. Sherman didn’t even
go through fraternity rush this year
and so has virtually no knowledge
of how the system works, I find it
inconceivable that he can offer
criticism to something that he has
never been associated with.

As far as Phi Kappa Sigma is
concerned, not once in recent me-
mory have we lost a pledge due to
the supposedly “degrading” nature
of our pledging activities. On the
contrary, hazing (or whatever you
wish to call it) is looked back on
by pledges and actives (of all fra-
ternities here I believe) as a worth-
while, unifying, and even enjoyable
experience. But it is perfectly natu-
ral for Mr. Shrman to be unable to
appreciate. these feelings—he has
never been involved in the system
which promote them,

| hope that in the future Mr,
Sherman will confine his advice and
letters to the Editor to subjects
about which he has some well-
founded criticism rather than tearing
down something which he knows
nothing about,

Is This A Free Spirit?

Last night I was in the periodi-
cal room of the library and was
witness to the usual lizzard sprawl
of students. This I take in stride
(well, almost), But one student was
barefooted and casually picking his
toes. Now the question arises: is
this a free spirit or a barbarian?
Is this a liberated man or a spoiled
brat? And, finally, what in the hell
goes on over there in terms of dis-
cipline and self discipline?

Disappointment Shown
To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

This week the Student Associa-
tion for Black Unity of W&L is pre-
senting its first annual Black Cul-
ture Week. This series of events has
been advertised through the Ring-
tum Phi, WLUR, the school calen-
dar, posters, flyers, and many, many
other sources,

The point of this letter is this: the
white students of W&L are, in my
opinion, taking a negative attitude
to Black Culture Week. For the last
few days | have heard or heard of
student statements such as “what
are these savages doing putting up
this Black s. .t” or “why are these
Blacks having a Black Culture Week
that doesn't relate to me.” It has
been stated over and over again that
the ‘week’ serves to help the Black
students to maintain their racial
identity (which WA&L doesn't do
much for) and to serve as a means
of educating the white students and
community of W&L as to what
Blacks and Black culture is all
about. |i is one way of answering
the proverbial white statement ‘I
can't understand Blacks, What do
they want?’

O.K. We have the week. Do the
students respond? No! Monday
night. Prof. Colon spoke at Lee
Chapel to an audience made up of
WAL faculty and administrators.
people from Lexington, some girls
from some school, and VERY FEW
WAL STUDENTS, For a student
body that can pack Lee Chapel to
hear some poems, listen to political
talk, and hear a good amateur play
piano—even when they are broad-
casted on WLUR—this is stupid.
lt is ridiculous, Contact was during

 

mid-terms but the talks were pack-
ed,

Saturday, S.A.B.U. is having a
‘Black Ball.’ This is the only social
affair put on in the ‘W&L tradition’
since I've been to this school. Are
students attending in groves? No.
Every member of SABU was to sell
ten reservations, I've sold 24. Only
one has been purchased by. a stu-
dent, I've even gone to students
rooms to announce the week, Some
students have shown interest and
said “I don’t have the five bucks on
me now but | am going.” However,
most have said “if I buy a ticket,
I'll get it from you” or “I've got bet-
ter things to do like studying.” Stu-
dents have time during exams to
see the stag flicks at the Lyric. They
always complain about nothing to
do, Give them something interest-
ing, relevant and financially cheap
and they don’t come.

I am pissed off to say the least. It
seems to me that the white students
are trying to ignore Black people.
For students like that I feel sorry
for you. You are acting like that
great president Calvin ‘if you ignore
it it'll go away’ Coolidge. Black peo-
ple must not and will not be ig-
nored! Ignore us and you will truly
suffer in the long run, (For years

Survey Results Announced

Almost half of the 352 men who
entered Washington and Lee Uni-
versity as freshmen last autumn
plan to become physicians or law-
yers—more than triple the propor-
tion among their counterparts across
the nation, according to results of
surveys made by the American
Council on Education at 326 col-
leges throughout the country in Sep-
tember,

The A.C.E. survey showed that
34.5 per cent of our freshmen are
planning careers as lawyers and 14.1
per cent as medical doctors or den-
tists, Nationally, the respective aver-
ages for men in four-year colleges
were 8.5 per cent and 7.0 per cent.

More than two-thirds here—69
per cent—said they keep abreast of
political affairs, 21 per cent more
than the men’s average nationally.

Our freshmen also described them-
selves as slightly more liberal than
their predecessors had one year
earlier. Politically, they were more
“far left’ or “liberal”—42.1 per
cent—and slightly less “conserva-
tive” or “far right"—26.7 per cent
~-in 1971 than the freshmen class
of a year earlier, when the figures
had been 36.2 per cent and 27.9
per cent. Middle-of-the-roaders ac-
counted for 36.2 per cent of the
freshmen in 1970 and just 31.2 per
cent this fall. Nationally, the score
was; “far left”—3.6 per cent to our

  

Students As Gentlemen

BY MARC SMALL

The Honor System is dead. It died
a lamentable death sometime dur-
ing my freshman or sophomore
year, along with the conventional
dress and the homogeneous student
body. It lives on in memory—a con-
venient way to raise money from
alumni and a saccharine sop to en-
tice potential freshmen—but in me-
mory alone, for the student body
supports the concept but not the
workings of an effective honor sys-
tem.

It requires moral courage to main-
tain such a moral code, It requires
substantial courage not merely to
live by an honor system—for that
is a measure of integrity the great
majority of us willingly agree to live
by—but rather to enforce it upon
others: it is not a pleasant thing: to
turn in a compadre or to warn a
friend that you may have to explain
some case involving him to the Exe-
cutive Committee. It is the courage
involved in turning in others that
has failed, and it is in this failure
that the Honor System has passed
away.

Yet, herein lies the crux of the
matter, since any moral code, like
any law, is only effective if en-
forced, We ourselves may live by
the code, but that code will be a
mockery and thoroughly unreliable
unless we are sure that all others
within the student body are com-
pelled also to abide by it. The im-
perfectibility of the human animal
requires that we, it we hope to be
judged by certain standards our-
selves, be willing to police the Honor
System to insure its proper function-
ing.

We are a select gathering of men,
well above the average in intellect
It should not be, and until recently
was not, impossible to function un-
derneath the firm standard of the
Honor System. Yet if we are to be
regarded as gentlemen, then it is
imperative that we behave as such,
no matter where we are or during
what part of the school year it may
happen to be. The concepts of integ-
rity and dignity know neither the
bounds of time or space: it is our
duty, both as individuals and as a
body, to insure that the respect for
our honesty gained over the past two
centuries shall not be sacrificed
thoughtlessly and needlessly,

The Honor System is dead, and
almost certainly beyond resurrec-
tion, lt would be far better for us

to vote it a quick and a clean deat
than to continue to mock its ghost
with every passing theft, falsehood,
and civil violation that a Washing-
ton and Lee student commits, The
students have shown with near un-
animity during the past two years
that they have no faith in the sys-
tem. The faculty have voiced their
concern by their disgust for inde-
pendent exams. Those groups work-
ing most closely with the Honor
System have found it wanting.

It is time for both the students
and the faculty to re-assess_ their
regard for the Honor System and to
examine its value. If the students de-
sire to realize that privilege implies
responsibility, then let us by all
means revive the Honor System. If
the students feel they are not will-
ing to police this student-run sys-
tem, then indeed it is time for us to
abolish the Honor System and, at
least, show to ourselves an honesty
we refuse to show to our fellows.

 

1.5, “liberal” — 38.0 per cent to
W&L’s 40.6 per cent, “middle of the
road”—41.4 as compared to our
31.2 per cent, “conservative’— 16.1
per cent to 25.8 per cent here, and
finally “far right” at 0.9 per cent all.

In their self-descriptions, Wash-
ington and Lee men see their acade-
mic talents as more abundant and
their families more affluent than the
national averages, They are some-
what less pessimistic than their peers
about the ability to change society;
36 per cent here against 47 per cent
nationally said they believe the in-
dividual has little influence. As may
be expected, then, they also intend
to vote this fall in heavier propor-
tions than the national average; 89
per cent as against 77 per cent
among male freshmen nationally.

The “average” W&L freshman
differed significantly in his attitudes
from his fellow freshmen nation-
ally in a number of fields, including
responses to the notion of abolish-
ing college grades (favored by only
27 per cent here, and 42 per cent
nationally), and to the idea of giving
preferential treatment to students
from so-called “disadvantaged” back-
grounds (favored by 40 per cent on
a national basis, 29 per cent at our
school).

A majority of freshmen both at
Washington and Lee and nationally
thought criminals had been given
“too many rights’—S7 per cent
here, 53 per cent in all four-year
colleges. And while 61 per cent of
their counterparts said they think
everybody should have the oppor-
tunity to go to college, only 43 per
cent of our freshmen said they
thought so.

Exactly half the male freshmen
nationally said they believe the fed-
eral government is not implement-
ing desegregation quickly enough,
but just 37.1 per cent at W&L said
they agree. More than 90 per cent,
however, both locally and na-
tionally, said they thought the fed-

Generals Barely Win
CAC Championship

The Basketball Generals stayed
home with a College Athletic Con-
ference Tournament Trophy and 17-
9 record in spite of dropping the
season's finale to Southwestern-at-
Memphis 79-78. The loss was a dis-
appointing one but was not a total
surprise. The Generals had won the
last two games by a total of three
points, 78-76 against Sewanee, and
76-75 against Centre.

All three teams were out to pick
off the defending champions. The
result was a three way tie for first
place. W&L ,Centre and Southwes-
tern all had 2-1 tournament records.

lwo generals were selected for
the CAC All-Tournament Team.
Mike Daniel was a repeater and
Skip Lichtfuss made the elite outfit
as a sophomore. Centre's James
Mason was chosen as the Outs and-
ing Player.

Thursday night the Generals
downed Sewanee. The opposition
was led by 7-0 center Bill Kosick

who grabbed 15 rebounds and
pumped in 33 points. Mike Daniel
led the W&L scorers with 25, Licht-
fuss hit for 18. Charlie Strain got
13, John Glace did a good defen-
sive job against Kosick.

The next evening W&L collided
with Centre, James Mason earned
his berth on the All-Tournament
team against the Blue. He clobbered
the Generals with 24 points, 19 re-
bounds and a blocked shot, It was
no surprise to see captain Daniel
sparkplug the Generals from 15
points behind, Mike connected for
22 points, nine rebounds and three
assists, It was Skip Lichtfuss who
cooly put the game away with his
7 for 8 marksmanship at the foul
line. Skip completed the game with
11 points. Doug Clelan had 11 also,
Paul McClure contributed 10 points,

rhe final game W&L ran out of
come-from-behind victories. Doug
Clelan established a new school rec-
ord for assists during the game. His
season total was 122, the old record
belonged to “Magic” Mel Cart-
wright. Washington and Lee fell be-
hind but as Coach Verne Canfield
said, “They never quit.” Lichtfuss
and Daniel were top Blue scorers
with 22 and 23 respectively. South-
western’s Cardwell, who tied a CAC
record with 34 points against Se-
wanee in the preliminaries, threw
in 27 against the Generals. But it

was foul shooting that won the game
for the visitors, The Lynx missed
only six shots in 37 tries—83 per
cent,

The calibre of the CAC tourna-
ment was relatively high. The four
entrants were evenly matched, The
six games were determined by a
total spread of 22 points,

Looking back on the 1971-72
season, the games were predom-
inantly tight up until the buzzer.
Canfield admitted, “We had too
many, too close.” During the season
eleven games were decided in the
final minute including all the CAC
Tournament games. Despite scoring
over 80 points per game, the Gen-
erals were a defense oriented team.
The high scoring average was due to
a potent fast break. The break was
especially devastating off a missed
foul shot. The Generals acquired a
low degree of balanced scoring. In
spite of the surge of sophomore
Skip Lichtfuss, the opposition knew
for the big play, the Blue would de-
pend on Mike Daniel.

Without a doubt, the star of the
17-9 season was senior Mike Daniel.
Daniel edged up to fourth on the
all-time W&L scoring list. This win-
ter, he averaged over 24 points a
game, and shot over 58 per cent
from the floor, On four different
occasions, the Academic All-Ameri-
can scored in excess of 30 points.
Emory and Henry Coach Arnold
Mellings said of the All-American
candidate, “He could play for any-
body in the country.”

The year had many high points
and many low ones for the b-ballers.
The victories over Centre and Rhode
Island (88-86) were outstanding.
The Blue was at its best. In both
games, the Generals played excel-
lent team basketball. The Blue re-

under pressure. Perhaps the most
disappointing aspect of the cam-
paign was the lack of consistency.
The Generals were hot only in
spurts, failing to put together long
winning streaks.

season continued, Daniel of course
was outstanding. Skip Lichtfuss
came on strong about mid-season.

By now, almost everyone knows
that Washington and Lee hosted the
College Athletic Conference basket-
ball tournament this past weekend,
and most know that the Generals
finished in a three-way tie for the
championship, losing the final game
by a mere point to Southwestern at
Memphis. So now its time for all
the armchair quarterbacks, or play-
makers, as the case may be, to em-
ploy their twenty-twenty hindsight to
analyze the tourney. And that in-
cludes yellow journalists like me,
Forthwith my comments on the
weekend:

The Generals could not buy a re-
bound. The only thing that kept
WAL in the games at all was some
hot outside shooting. If the Generals
had not come charging back in the
second half of each game, using an
aggressive defense and an outside
game, they might have been blown
off the court. Had the club been
able to command the boards, the
Generals would have been easy vic-
tors. It was just a bit too much to
expect a team to pull three games
three nights in a row out of the fire,
as W&L did the first two games.

One of the best shows of the year
came to Lexington and played to a
big crowd Thursday night, specific-

los tried hard to rate his own Sports
IMustrated article a la Bill Mussel-
man of Minnesota, succeeding only
in costing his team a victory and in
making a spectacle of himself, In-
deed, the Generals hit all three foul
shots awarded them due to Davalos’
technical fouls, beating the Purple
Tigers by two points. The Sewanee
mentor seemed itching for a fight,
and later that night he almost got
one with W&L’s Boyd Williams.
Anyhow, Davalos seemed to add his
name to the growing list of basket-
ball coaches who ought to be in
football somewhere.

And just out of curiosity, what
was the reason given for the loss of
lighting Saturday night? Rumor has
it that somebody hit the light switch,
If that’s the explanation, well, never
mind, but it seems silly that such a
possibility could occur,

And finally, congratulations to
Mike Daniel and Skip Lichtfuss for
their All-CAC performances and to
Coach Verne Canfield for his res-
traint in the Davalos matter in
which the latter cast aspersions up-
on Canfield’s ancestry. Oh yes, con-
grats to the swimming team for its
CAC championship and to the
wrestling team for its third place

Swimmers Win CAC Crown;
W&L Wrestlers Place Third

Washington and Lee successfully
defended its College Athletic Con-

ference swimming championship
during the conference meet last
weekend at Centre College, Ky.,

setting several new records in the
process. Meanwhile, the wrestling
team finished a close third in their
CAC competition.

The Generals’ Beach (Bim) Clark
of Atlanta was named the “Out-
standing Swimmer” after winning
two individual events, placing sec-
ond in another, and swimming on
two winning relay teams. He set
new meet, pool, school and confer-
ence records in winning the 200-yard
butterfly, and tied the meet and
pool records in winning the 100-yard
butterfly. He also finished second in
the 50-yard freestyle and swam on
the winning W&L medley relay and
freestyle relay teams,

WA&L’s John Lawlor set new meet,

pool, school and conference records
in winning the 1650-yard freestyle,
and also won the 200-yard breast-
stroke, was second in the 400-yard
individual medley, and was on the
winning medley relay team,

Other winners for W&L were
freshman Steve Johnston in the
500-yard freestyle; sophomore Rick
McCain in the 100-yard  breast-
stroke; the 400-yard medley relay
team of Hal Catlin, Lawlor, Clark
and freshman Bill Brotherton; the
400-yard freestyle relay team of
freshmen Dick Barber and Jim Ho-
ward, Aven Sharp and Clark; and
the 800-yard freestyle relay team
of Catlin, Johnston, Alan Corwith

and Brotherton .

Sewanee finished second to W&L
in the conference meet, followed by
host Centre and Washington Uni-
versity of St. Louis,

Meanwhile, the Generals wrest-

ling team finished a close third in
the season-ending College Athletic
Conference meet last weekend, but
new W&L Coach John Piper sees a
bright outlook for his young charges.

Wa&L tallied 6914 points to run-
ner-up Centre’s 7214 and winning
Sewanee’s 10214. Washington Uni-
versity of St. Louis was fourth with
3614, and host Southwestern (Tenn.)
was fifth with 7.

All of W&L’s wrestlers placed in
the tournament, and the Generals
had two champions in 126-pound
Rolf Piranian and 177-pound Doug
Ford, Runners-up for the Generals
were 142-pound captain Bill West,
167-pound Sam Lewis and 190-
pound Lanny Rainey.

Finishing third were 118-pound
Dunean DeGraff, 134-pound Rick
Marsh and 150-pound Jim Stieff.
Fourth-place finishers for the Gen-
erals were 158-pound Perry Sowell

 

Wrestling team captain Bill West goes to work on his man in the Hampden-Sydney match. West was a run-
ner-up in the 142-pound class at the CAC Tournament.

cause we know most of the Blacks
in the community.

The educational aspects relating
to Black students can be shown
by simply saying that the Black,
upon entering a school with Wash-
ington and Lee's caliber realize that
he is behind. He is behind in his edu-
cation because his secondary edu-
cation gave him limited access to
quality educational material and
facilities simply because the school
was predominantly Black. Since cal-
culus is the lowest math course here
and no remedial course is offered in
English, the Black student has to
spend some of his time trying to
learn what was not offered in his
high school.

We now generally agree that the
administration and the faculty is
seeing that this is no longer a homo-
geneous student body but is now a
heterogeneous student body. When
we Blacks first entered Washington
and Lee University and discovered
the problems which existed, we gave
the administration and the faculty
a chance to alleviate them. Al-
though the administration and facul-
ty are not faultless and flawless, all
of us — Black students — recognize
their help and determination to get
rid of the problems. Unlike most
administrations and faculties at pre-
dominately white institutions, Wash-
ington and Lee recognizes that she is
dealing with something unique and
is trying to work out things in re-

absolute penalty. He said that it
would be a rare instance in which
he would agree with permanent dis-
missal as an appropriate penalty,
and expressed the opinion that the
ostracism resulting from widespread
scrutiny of a public notice of an
honor violation would be a suffici-
ent penalty in nearly all cases.

“B” also suggested several pro-
cedural changes in the EC's job of
administering the Honor System.
He advised that a much more in-
tensive and lengthy orientation pro-
gram be implemented and re-em-
phasized throughout the year, It
was also his idea that a “pre-trial
hearing” would be valuable in con-
sidering a possible violation, and
that, in the event it was determined
by the EC to proceed to a private
hearing, the accused be permitted
to have advisors, probably law stu-
dents, sitting as advisors, He also
felt that, in the event of a public
hearing. the first twelve students
chosen at random by the computer
with no prior knowledge of the case
be taken as jurors, and that the
hearing should remain public, with
the accused having the option of
determining its location.

sponse to this uniqueness. Many
problems still remain and many ob-
stacles still block the road to suc-
cess but we as Black students hope
that the administration will continue
to communicate and work along
with us so we can have an amelio-
ration of these problems and ob-
stacles.

Black students have come a long
way since last year. Other than the
two Black students in law and the
two Black seniors, all the other
Blacks are freshmen and sopho-
mores. Organizing ourselves into a
group whose goal is to facilitate
the eradication of the problems
came quite easy. We, the Student
Association for Black Unity, con-
ceive of ourselves as an_ essential
organization for both the Univer-
sity and the Black community, Our
intention is to show the things need-
ed at the University—from  curri-
culum revision to recruitment-and
to propagate throughout the whole
and the community what Blackness
really is. This is one of the main
reasons for Black Culture Week.

This week began on Monday,
February 28 and will end March 4.
Professor Herbert Marshall of Nor-
folk State College will be the guest
speaker tonight. This speech is in the
memory of Leslie Smith, the first
Black Law student to graduate from
Washington and Lee University.
Smith was slain while working for
the Justice Department in Washing-
ton, D.C, this year. The Black stu-
dents from the Roanoke Public
school will give their Black History
Presentation titled “Legacy of Free-
dom” on Thursday.

We previously tried to get LC.
Norcom High School from Ports-
mouth, Virginia. This fell through
because of our—Student Association
for Black Unity—tlack of funds to
meet the cost. We hope and are
diligently working toawrds having
them during the latter part of
March. There will be a symposium
Friday and its theme will be “On
Being Black—In a White Society”
The Black students of Washington
and Lee and surrounding colleges
will make up the panel. The last
event of Black Culture Week will
be held on Saturday night. This will
be a formal or semi-formal Ball and
the music will be given by The Dy-
namics of Lynchburg.

Yes, this is the first time that
something of this nature has ever
been given at Washington and Lee
University. | did not elaborate on
the white students’ concern and at-
titude toawrds Blacks and Black-
ness but their concern or indiffer-
ence will be shown by their pre-
sence and support during the first
Black Culture Week at Washing-
ton and Lee University. This school
is no longer the same as it was five
years ago. This is now the new
Washington and Lee University.
