W&L Opens $56 Million Development Drive

President Robert E. R. Huntley
announced a $56 million university-
wide development program for the
1970's during the Founder's Day
Convocation yesterday. According to
Mr. Huntley, $36 million should be
raised by 1976. This program consti-
tutes the largest undertaking of its
kind by a school of W&L’s size.

Also taking part in the develop
ment announcement were two trus-
tees: Dr. John Newton Thomas of
Richmond, rector of the board of
trustees and John M. Stemmons of
Dallas, chairman of the “Achieve-
ment Council.”

Dr. Thomas told the audience in
Doremus Gymnasium that over $9.2
million had already been acquired
toward the goal, with the board of
trustees unanimously pitching in for
a total of $2.5 million.

The total figure of $56 million
can be broken down into three ma-
jor categories. First, $24 million in
new endowment funds will be rais
ed, Second is $24 million for con-
struction and major renovations,

The remaining $8 million is to sup-
port the academic programs through

|

the annual Alumni and Parents’
Funds,

Two new buildings will be con-
structed, a School of Law, and an
undergraduate library, The law
school wil Icost about $7 million;
the library is price tagged at $5.25
million,

In his speech President Huntley
asked his fellow institution members
to “recommit ourselves to the
future.”

Before announcing the scope of
the development plan, the president
outlined some of the “general
premises” that guided the two year
study involved with the project.
Huntley said, “the university should
remain small.” Although this idea
was considered relative, he said that
for W&L size was also an absolute
concept,

“The University will need to main-
tain and enhance its long standing
commitment to the premise that the
best in liberal education and the
best in professional or pre-profes
sional education can and should be
combined at Washington and
Huntley added, “There is

Lec,”
no di-

 

President Huntley: “Never has W&L sought to solve its needs a decade
in advance and never so seriously pursued such a goal.”

chotomy between them but rather
each re-enforces the other and they
become inextricably interwoven to
the enhancement of both. Therefore,
the depth and scope of Washington
and Lee’s curriculum must be re-
tained,”

Next Huntley turned to the busi
ness of graduate schools. “Washing
ton and Lee will not in all likehood
wish to add further graduate pro-
grams, but will strive to do its thing
in the best possible way.”

The President added that “the
faculty, which this university has
attracted is its greatest single

strength. The faculty must be large
enough to create the opportunity for
close relationships with the students
and with each other, must have the

capacity, the training and the in-
tegrity to act as the intelelctual
stimulus to the campus and must

be dedicated to the conviction that

Hotchkiss Talks
In The Cockpit

The W&L alumni have challenged
the student body to raise funds for
University. The alumni promise to
put up three dollars for every one
dollar donated by the students. Stu-
dents may respond to the chal-
lenge in the Co-op.

This concept of gaining monetary
support for the school came out of
the Alumni Conference this winter.
Alumni felt this approach might
encourage students to acquire the
donation habit early.

With this in mind, the Executive
Committee designated a_ student
“planning and development” com-
mittee to work as a go-between,
the student committee, headed by
Mike McCall, will explain and in-
form the students of the importance
of their future support and explain
how the University is managed.

Starting last Sunday night the
committee began a campaign com-
plete with radio announcements,
posters, tapes and personal contacts,
culminating tonight with an informal
seminar in the Cockpit, Farris
Hotchkiss of the Development
Office will be present. The program

will emphasize the importance of
alumni paritcipation in = school
affairs

The program will be unique for
two reasons according to the com
mittee chairman MeCall. McCall
stated “It is the first such program
organized by students in a Virginia
college and the path of
WAL's educational future may be
guided by the outcome.”

Huntley continued with his “gen-
eral precepts”: “For every area of
the formal curriculum there must

be a selective but rich array of non-
curricular and co-curricular opor-
tunities for our students and faculty
... the university's bold step in the
1950’s to an athletic program, for
all here who wish to avail them-
selves of it, was the right step.”
“The university must have an en-
larged capacity to provide financial
help to students who share Wash-

ington and Lee's philosophy of
education who wish to be a part
of it but who cannot afford to
attend without assistance... fi

nancial integrity and soundness are
essential.”

west of its current site in Tucker
Hall. The enrollment of the law
school will rise from 250 to 350
when expansion is complete. The
current floor will increase six-

fold.

The new undergraduate
will be located in the area of the
Washington Annexes and will de-
scend into the ravine. It will be
four times larger than the current
structure. The cost is estimated at
$5.2 million.

When the library is moved out
of McCormick Hall, the Commerce
School will move into that structure.
Huntley commented, “the library.

Both the vacated Newcomb and
Fucker Halls will be remodeled and
turned over to undergraduate de
partments that are “tucked in attics”
according to the president.

Ground should be broken within
six months on new unmarried hous
ing in the ravine area. The dormi
tories will be modular in construc-
tion. Around 200 units are sched-
uled for completion by 1976, th

During his remarks on the con-

stressed a “close-knit community of
buildings,”

An additional $24 million is hop-
ed to be raised for endowment.
Included in this total is increasing
student financial aid by $6 million.
Another $18 million can be spent
to maintain facilities, and continue

projects,

The final category of the $56

President Huntley claimed that
“never has W&L sought to solve its
needs a decade in advance and
never so seriously pursued such a
goal this is an objective we
must aspire to.”

In his brief remarks, Mr. Stem
mons assured the assembled students
that the board of trustees “is dedi

cated to excel

lence.” Mr. Stemmons drew particu
lar attention to the $8 million in
annual giving. He called it “the

catalyst that keeps this excellence
alive.” The Texas trustee also ela

Athletic Program’s Problems

By ROB LaRUF

As a perusal of page thirty-eight
of the Washington and Lee Univer-
sity Bulletin will attest, athletics are
looked upon as “an integral part of
the educational program.” That is
to say, the athletic program receives
the consideration of the University
without its becoming the all-im-
portant image-making colossus that
it has become at many large institu
tions of higher learning.

However, the W&L program is
not without its problems. Although

Letters To The Editor...

Gentlemanly Behavior?

To The Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Washington and Lee University
has had the reputation of being a
school where “the conduct of gentie-
men” is expected at all times from
the members of its community.

This past Friday night, I, along
with others, who walked along Jef-
ferson Street on our way to the
Troubadour Theatre’s excellent pro-
duction of “Luther” witnessed a
scene at the Phi Kappa Sigma
House which certainly was not
“gentlemanly” in nature, I question
whether the actions witnessed could
be considered humane. It was the
eve before the formal initiation of
the Class of 1975 pledges into the
house. The scene was one in which
supposedly rational college students
were subjecting fellow supposedly
rational college students to degrada-
tion, Both actives and pledges were
wrong. The actives for initiating
such hazing, and the pledges for
willingly going through it for the
sake of entrance to the house,

The actual scene I witnessed was
a pledge strutting across the street
from the parking lot side of Jef-
ferson and up the stairs mimicking
a duck the whole time. He was then
subject to a douse of cold water
from a third floor window—this
while it is snowing and the pledge
clad in a t-shirt. He was then swatted
up to the door where he begged
pounded and hollered “hellos and
yes sirs” to gain admittance to the
foyer. From that point the passer-
by can only surmise as to what
next falls upon the victim.

This type of severe hazing is
not restricted to just one or two
houses but is typical of the fratern-
ity system. Some say they enjoy
it and cite it as an “example of
brotherhood” and “an experience
worth going through.” I, and I am
sure others do also, find such state-
ments a poor justification when the
goal of “brotherhood” can be pro-
moted in a more constructive way.

Should any one person be subject
to such physical abuse in order to
have the opportunity to join to-

gether in a_ social-living arrange-
ment? | say no, Certainly there
will always be some hazing,. but let
it be in a less sever manner, Pro-
mote the desired comradship through
group social, service, and athletic
activities rather than degradation
and fear currently used. The end
result will be a much more sincere
relationship.

I don’t wish to give the impres-
sion that this letter is aimed at the
Phi Kappa Sigma House, It is not.
Some of the best people on campus
are found among its actives. and
pledges. What I am objecting to is
the approach taken by the fraterni-
ties as a whole. | am asking that
they and the University reevaluate
themselves and the means by which
they reach their desired goals and
that they seek means that are more
civilized and suited to the spirit
of “brotherhood” they espouse.

Unnecessary Frustrations

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

As a member of Students for
Coeducation and as a sincerely con-
cerned student interested in upgrad-
ing the quality of education at
W&L I would like to give one of
many arguments in favor of co-
education. I chose this argument
because it is particularly applicable
to myself and has convinced me
that coeducation is a valuable asset
to a college education. I hope it
will do the same for others.

Because W&L is an all male
school, students cannot relate prop-
erly to women. We can not get to
know women. Almost the only con-
tact we have with women is on
dates. For this reason we can't get
to know attitudes, emotions and
feelings a woman has at different
times. Furthermore, segregation of
the sexes is an unnatural thing and
should be avoided. Men and women
are meant to live together. This is
one of the few natural laws I
believe in. Separation leads to un-
necessary frustrations.

Like everybody tells us, the col-

Studied In Law Course
Juvenile Justice System

During the past semester at the
Law School, twelve second and
third year law students were en-
rolled in a new course designed to
study the juvenile justice system.
The Juvenile Justice Workshop was
conceived by and conducted under
the auspices of Professor Wifred
J. Ritz in an effort to provide an
overall view of all aspects of the
juvenile justice process.

The need for study in this field
is revealed by the alarming statistics
concerning youthful offenders, For
example, violent crime by children
increased 148 percent during the

1960's; persons under 25 account
for over 59 percent of the crimes

By LEX McMILLAN

The Ring-tum Phi is one of the
favorite objects of criticism for the
student body, It is accused of being,
one-sided, poorly written, grammati-
cally weak and full of errors, These
are impressive charges and in many
instances they are correct. Indeed,
oftentimes the “Phi” is boring. This
might be a result of the fact that
WAL is boring; it is you know.
The only really “un-boring” sort of
things that go on here are intel-
lectual and academic. | would wager
that if the “Phi” devoted itself
exclusively to the intellectual and
academic there really would be an
outraged student body (e.g., We get
enough of that in class.) After all,
most W&L men don't come here
for enlightement. They come for
social advancement, potential job
security, freedom to choose a lucra-
tive position in the “real world”
and of course because “it’s the thing
to do.”

In regard to the charge of “one-
sidedness,” | can only say that this
is not intentional (it it exists.) It is
very easy to get your opinion ex-
pressed in the “Phi”. Letters to the
Editor are always encouraged and
special column space is frequently
provided for students who are not
even staff members. If the “Phi” is
one-sided it is because of students
being more enamored with idle
criticism than with active efforts to
change the situation,

In fact, considering the stagger-
ingly large number of high school
newspaper editors and writers that
enter W&L each year, I am sure
that the “Phi” could be an extra-
ordinary college newspaper. We have
the talent, but it goes wasted and is
merely reflected in the authoritative
mumblings of those who can tell
you how to do it but don't have
the necessary qualities that would
enable them to do it themselves.

The other criticisms which I men-
tioned above and any others that I
can think of could be eliminated if
those who have the talent would
step forward, In other words, “Put
up or shut up.”

Well the above shouldn't be a very
earth-shaking revelation, It is the
obvious solution. For a long time
the handful of dedicated souls that
grind out the “Phi” every week
have hoped that their sad smallness
would be someday supplemented
by a journalistic renaissance. (Please
don't accuse me of self-adulation in
the above comment about the “de-
dicated souls”.) | readily exclude
myself from that group, All 1 do
is sit down a couple of times a
month and relieve some inner ten-
sions, This is not too difficult and
it's fun. There is a formidable num-
ber of other activities which consti-
tute the assembling of a newspaper.
| help with none of them.

The other solution is the appear-
ance of a completely independent
competing newspaper. We used to
have two “Phi's” but their relation
was not as much competitive as it
was symbolic, They existed to an-
tagonize one another and indulge in
petty back-biting. Fortunately these
two mirrored images became a

specter,
But now an alternative has ap-
peared (so they say) With im-

measurable audacity The Tango has
arrived, billing itself as the al-
ternative to the “Phi.” When I
heard of the upcoming appearance
of this “journalistic endeavor,” |
was rather impressed and enthused.
The idea of a competing forum to
raise the quality of student journ-
alism is an excellent one, However,
having read as much of The Tango
as | could stomach Owhich was al-
most all; | have a very strong
stomach) | turned from it with a
mixture of negative emotions. In-
deed, | hardly know where to start,
| feel somewhat embarrassed that
such an incredibly puerile combina-
tion of nonsense and bad taste
could have been produced by Wash-
ington and Lee students. Particularly
offensive is the blasphemous and
tasteless story concerning the cir-
cumstances of the birth of Christ
In addition, the story by the

“Letting Go’

anonymous Hollins coed is not only
a gross exaggeration but also a
rather poor reflection of the men-
tality of the writer (if the writer
was a Hollins’ coed at all),

I could continue but I think few
will have difficulty in realizing the
multitudinous deficiencies of this in-
sult to the campus public. (1 hope
this abortive attempt at cuteness
will not reach any public outside
of the Washington and Lee com-
munity. After all, we are used to
excesses, but the general public
might rise up in arms,

The real danger that I see is ad-
dressing myself to this subject at
all is that the producers of The
Tango can simply fall comfortably
back on their own insubstantiality
and claim that my very criticism
is what they intended, Their self-
proclaimed “daringly existentialist
(sic)” format was meant to be every-
thing I condemn it for. Yuk, Yuk.
Well, if that is the case then my
condemnation is doubled because
their insult is premeditated rather
than the product of an inexperienc-
ed first try at humor and satire.
(1 would like to think the latter.)

Either way the spectacle is
affrontive to the dignity, the intelli-
gence and the reputation of Wash-
ington and Lee. The Tango is not
supported by school funds, It is an
independent profit-making venture.
You can vote for its demise by
the simplest democratic means avail-
able: don’t buy it!

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

enerals End 15-8 Season;
AC Tournament

By PALMER TRICE

With only one week remaining
in the 1971-72 basketball season,
one can only look back at the
season as a successful one, The
Generals have assured themselves of
another winning season, Their rec-
ord of 15-8 is certainly nothing to
be ashamed of, especially if one
considers the fact that this team
played without the obvious advant-
ges of Old Doremus, and the fact
that the 1971-72 club played one
of the toughest schedules lined up by
this university. The Blue have been
an exciting team, having lost and
won many squeakers.

Ihe Generals entered this week
wiih one goal: to win the rest of
their games. If they could do this,
they held a chance of obtaining an
NCAA bid for the post-season
tournament. Last Thursday, the
Blue traveled to Carlisle, Pennsyl-
vania, to take on the outstanding
Dickinson College hoopers. In what
seems to be the usual General
they fell behind early. At
one point in the first half, Dickin-
son led by as much as 11, They
were being led mostly by Frank
“The Gnat” Noonan. The Blue
closed to five at the half.

the Generals charged out in the

fashion,

second half, and tied the score at

44, with 14:50 left in the game.
Mike Daniel gave the Blue their
first lead on a three point play.

With 10:56 left in regulation, W&L
led by 50-48. With fifty-nine sec-
onds left in regulation, Skip Licht-
fuss put the Blue up by seven. Led
by the 5°3° Noonan, Dickinson tied
the score on a last second shot,
70-70, W&L jumped to an early
lead in the five minute overtime,
and maintained it. The lead was
eight at one time, but it dwindled
to the final 80-76 score.

Little can be said about the
Davis and Elkins game. The final
99-68 score speaks for itself. Every-
one played, and just about every-
one scored. The contest was in
honor of the five graduating seniors,
who were presented with honorary
certificates before the game. Mike
Daniel had 23 points, John Glace,
17 points, Ellie Gutshall, 10 points,
and Dave Stone, 8 points, Tall
Paul McClure had 14 points and
14 rebounds. Mike Daniel's 23
points pushed him up to fourth on
the all-time list of W&L scorers,

Monday night, the Generals
traveled to Belmont-Abbey. The
close ones caught up with them

ext

a tough loss to take. The Blue
dropped a 73-71 decision, Once
again, the Generals fell behind

early, They trailed by as many as
11 in the first half, but managed
to gain a tie at the half, 38-38. In
the second half, the Generals open-
ed up quickly. They opened up five
point leads on three separate oc-
casions. But with 1:25 left, Bel-
mont-Abbey led by 71-69. They
made two foul shots, to match the
Blue’s basket.

Belmont-Abbey was a_ running
team, They made more turnovers
than the Blue, but managed to over-
come them, Mike Daniel had 24
points and 9 rebounds, while Paul
McClure had 9 points and 17 re-
bounds. Skip Lichtfuss had 18 points
and 10 rebounds. The Generals
three man show wasn't enough to
overcome a Belmont-Abbey team
effort.

The Generals carry a 15-8 record
into the C.A.C, Tournament this
weekend. The round robin format
could hurt the Blue’s chances, al-
though they still should be the
favorite. Too bad about _ the
NCAA's, but better a bridesmaid
than nothing at all.

Wrestlers Reach .500

Washington and Lee has its first
500 wrestling team since 1964-65
when the Generals went 7-3-1. So
far the Blue has a 6-6-1 mark at
the conclusion on the regular sea-
son, The CAC tournament remains
to be completed this weekend.

The grapplers have pulled off
three straight wins: 45-6 against
Lynchburg, 41-9 against Galluadet,
and 24-16 against Hampden-Sydney.

Duncan DeGraff has continued to
lead the squad with a 10-2 record,
consisting of six pins and 42 team
points. Rick Marsh at 126 pounds
has turned his trend around and
won four straight matches by pins,
after losing his first four clashes.

Concerning the CAC tournament,
Coach John Piper says, “We're more
of a competitor than last year.”
The team finished second last winter
in the annual championships.

Next year should be just as

promising according to Piper, Only
one senior will be lost through
graduation—captain Bill West. De-
Graff is only a freshman. And
supposedly, the recruiting is com-
ing along real well.

As the wrestling program said
Monday evening, “You've come a
long way, baby.”

Weight Room Features
Universal Gym

By NEIL LUTINS

[he new weightroom opened
about two weeks ago in Doremus
Gymnasium, It is on the 300-level,
below the coaches’ offices. On the
wooden half of the floor are the
old stock of disc weights, bars, and
benches that have been repainted,
patched, refinished and are now on

about $2200, This remarkable piece
of equipment has fifteen stations
and comes in two parts. The major
part contains devices for leg presses
up to 760 pounds, chest presses to
230 pounds, high lat pulls to 210
pounds, curls and dead lifts to
160 pounds. It also has stations for
chinning, dipping and hip flexing.

ing while finishing second in the
100-yard freestyle. Johnston also set
a new school record in the 500-yard
freestyle with a time of 5:20.3.

WAL will be favored to repeat
as conference champions in the an-
nual College Athletic Conference

lege in Kentucky. Afterwards,
Clark and Brotherton, and possibly
others who may yet qualify, will

believe it would lessen the occur-

day and not just on the weekends.
Unnecessary frustrations and built
up emotions (horniness) would not
be as great. Misunderstanding re-
sulting from this would be less fre-
quent but, more importantly, a boy
would get to see a girl in dif-
ferent contexts, He would at these
times regard her in terms other than
sexual. The important thing is to
regard a girl as a person and not
an object of pleasure,

Twelve Law Students Explore
Virginia Juvenile Justice System

(Continued from page 3)
of violence each year; the recidiv-
ism rate for juveniles is nearly
75 percent, which is higher than
the rate for adult criminals.

In attempting to discern the par-
ticular problems involved in the
juvenile justice system, the course
has eschewed the traditional lecture
and case book approach. In addi-
tion to basic reading assignments,
the course has utilized field trips
to juvenile detention and
tional facilities, individual student
attendance at juvenile court pro-
ceedings throughout the State, and
on-campus panel discussions with
authorities in the field.

corree-

The various field trips have in-
cluded tours of the new and ex-
perimental Robert F. Kennedy
Youth Center in Morgantown, West
Virginia, the Beaumont School for
Boys, the Bon Air School for Girls,

the Petersburg Federal Reforma-
tory, and several other facilities
concerned with juvenile correction
and rehabilitation. The visits by

Workshop members included not
only an inspection of the physical
plant, but also a question and
answer period with the administra-
tors.

Although some institutions were
more progressive and better equip-
ped than others, the emphasis at
all the juvenile facilities was re
habilitative rather than punitive and
custodial, For example, most do not
have fences, guards, lock-up facili-
ties, etc. At some, tours were
partially conducted by members of
the institution's population, thus
affording uninhibited answers to

some pointed questions regarding

Guest authorities for on-campus
panel discussions have been interest-
ing and quite varied in their in-
volvement with juvenile programs.
They have included, among others,
Frank Kelly, Director, Governor's
Council on Narcotics and Drug
Abuse Control; Carroll Minor, Di-
rector, Division of Youth Services,
Virginia Department of Welfare and
Institutions; Judge Lawrence L.
Koontz, Juvenile and Domestic Re-
lations Court, City of Roanoke, and
other law enforcement and admini-
strative officials involved with juve-
niles. All panel discussions empha-
size spontaneity and permit each
student the pursue the specific area
that holds the most interest for
him,

Juvenile justice is a many faceted
problem with few, if any, clear
answers. Workshop members have
found the topic both interesting and
timely and the course has provided
an effective, overall view of the
juvenile justice system.

W&L Athletics

(Continued from page 2)

In addition, upper level physical
education courses will become
more sophisticated. A “Care and
Prevention of Athletic Injuries”
course will be offered and will be
complemented by an “Administra-
tion and Physical Education” offer-
ing. Hours have not as yet been
decided. The care and prevention
course may include practice by the

student as a trainer. McHenry em-
phasized that the object of the
academic aspects was to reflect the
changing needs and attitudes of the
students,

These are some of the difficulties
which face the Washington and Lee
University Athletic Department.
They present a challenge to the
philosophy to which the school so
strongly adheres, and yet they are
not so insuperable with the proper
handing. W&L has shown that it
has successfully made the conver-
sion from a_ big-time high-cost
athletics to non-subsidization; it has
sought to improve its athletic physi-
cal plant; it is maintaining an intra-
mural program which Athletic Di-
rector William McHenry calls the
finest he’s seen; it has expanded
academically; and it has grappled
with the perplexing dilemma of
competitive scheduling.

All of this has been conducted
on a financial framework much
smaller than the littlest of big-time
schools. Indeed, the Athletic De-
partment has successfully met every-
one of the recommendations made
to it by the 1964-66 University
Self-Study Report. While the Athle-
tic Department is not without
problems, it is also not without
a desire to solve them,

The aparatus contains no danger-

principle of leverage. One of the
best features about the Universal
Gym is that no spotters are neces-

by merely moving a small pin. A
