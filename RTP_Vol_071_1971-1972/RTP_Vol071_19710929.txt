er director for London's Royal

Court Theatre, arrived in Lexington
last Monday to begin preliminary
work on the student production,
which he will direct under endow-
ment from the Glasgow Foundation.

Bergman Film Screened
In Reid’s Cinema Series

One of the most brilliant cine-
matic efforts by the Swedish director
Ingmar Bergman, “Wild Strawber-
ries,” will be presented Monday,
October 4, beginning at 7:30 p.m. in
Reid Hall Auditorium. The film is
the second in a series of classics pro-
cured for Professor O. W. Riegel’s
introductory course on the Motion
Picture; anyone interested is invited
to attend the screening.

“Wild Strawberries” appeared in
1957, and immediately the film cap-
tured critical accolades for its intro-
spection, imagination, and superb
performances, It is noted especially
for its dream sequences, through
which Bergman traces the develop-
ment of a Swedish family through
three successive generations.

The film focuses on the elderly
character of Isak Borg, warmingly
portrayed by Victor Sjostrom, who
Bergman follows through a series of
dreams which recall his past and his
fear of death and sterility, An in-
strumental character in his images,
the Sara of Isak's youth, who repre-
sents the product of a strictly moral
and inhibited upbringing, is contrast-
ed with the later Sara of Isak's eld-
erly years, who portrays freedom
and responsibility from familial sup
pression

Though the regulars of many of
Bergman's later works, Max Von Sy
dow and Liv Lilman, are absent in

Wild Strawberries,” this early film
does mark one of the first appear

ances of Bibi Andersson as the two
Saras, Andersson has been recently
acclaimed for her performance of a
tortured Swedish housewife in love
with Eliott Gould in Bergman's first
English language production, “The
Touch.”

Critics and Bergman fans have al-
ways regarded “Wild Strawberries”
as a hallmark in the Swedish artist's
brilliant, though uneven, career, It
has always been one of Bergman's
most cherished films, because in it
Bergman was able to achieve an
unsurpassed degree of tranquillity
and resolution, Bergman's films, in
addition, have always been noted for
their stark, textured photography
which simply fills the eye, and
“Wild Strawberries” is no exception
in this respect.

The first film in the WAL series,
an uncut version of D. W. Griffith's
“Birth of a Nation” was shown to
SRO crowds for two nights. Motion
pictures to follow throughout the
season are classics by such noted di

rectors as Murnau, Renoir, Rene
Clair, and Carol Reed.
Basketball Pep Band A Band is

being formed to play at the open
ing of the new gym and other home

Candidates must be nominated by
Liaison Officers of their undergra-
duate institutions by November 1,
1971. The Foundation does not ac-
cept direct applications for the Fel-
lowships.

Those who receive the fellowship
get four years of financial assistance,
with a maximum annual living sti-
pend of $2,700 for single Fellows
and $2,950 for married Fellows,
plus tuition and fees. Dependency
allowances are available. Financial
need is not a condition for consid-
eration.

Danforth Fellows may hold cer-
tain other fellowships such as Ford,
Fulbright, National Science, Rhodes,
etc, concurrently and will be Dan-
forth Fellows without stipend until
the other awards lapse. They may
also be designated honorary Wood
row Wilson Fellows,

The Danforth Foundation, created
in 1927, is a philanthropy concerned
primarily with people and values.
Presently the Foundation focuses its
activities in two major areas, educa
tion and the city. In these areas the
Foundation administers programs
and makes grants to schools, col-
leges, universities and other public
and private agencies.

The last WAL recipient was form-
er Student Body President Marvin
C,. “Swede” Henberg. who went on
to graduate study in Philosophy at
the University of Texas. Henberg
will continue as a Danforth Fellow
following his two years with the
Rhodes Scholarship in Great Britain

 

1965. Finding that he disliked act-
ing, he became interested in stage
managering and directing. His di-
rectorial credits include “The Re-
storation of Arthur Middleton” by
David Storey and several plays by
Christopher Hampton, including
“Total Eclipse” and “The Philan-
thropist.” The latter is playing its
second year in London and is pres-
ently a hit in New York with Alec
McGowen.

Kidd has also recently done work
for Grenada Television, with such
noted actors as Alec Guiness,

Mr. Lee Kahn, W&L professor of
drama, spent last year on leave in
Great Britain and Europe, met Kidd
there, and asked him to come to
WA&L to work with the Troubadour
rheatre.

“It's something I fancied doing
for some time,” said Mr. Kidd. “I'd
rather work in this environment than
in some taddy old reportory theatre
in North Scotland.”

His approach to Macbeth is not
yet firmly plotted. “You would like
to tackle it as you would a new
play,” he remarked. “It's a young
man’s play. You do it as truthfully
and as accurately as possible.”

He acknowledged that the langu-
age of the play is archaic and will
pose a problem to the student actors,
but expressed hope that the produc-
tion will still be new and vital

EC Establishes
New Committee
To Plan Dorm

The Executive Committee, meet-
ing in regular session Monday night,
established a student advisory com-
mittee to aid University officials in
the planning of the new upperclass
dormitories to be built in the ravine
in the back campus. There will be a
general meeting of all interested in
serving on such a committee next
Tuesday, October 5, at 7 p.m. in the
EC room of the Student Center.

In other business, the EC estab-
lished dates for a Dance Board con-
cert, approved the purchase of a
new photograph reproducer for the

under a grant from the Glasgow En-
dowment Foundation, which brings
prominent lecturers and teachers in
the arts and literature to the W&L
campus. The last visitor under a
Glasgow grant was author Reynolds
Price, who spent three weeks in Lex-
ington last spring to work with stu-
dents and to lecture on fiction.

The production of “Macbeth” will
be presented starting Wednesday,
November 3, and will continue
through the following Saturday, No-
vember 6. The Troubadours will fol-
low this with a presentation of John
Osborne's biographical drama, “Lut-
her,” in February.

Lewis G. John and Assistant to the
President Frank Parsons have re-
quested student representatives who
can join them in preliminary meet-
ings with the architect concerning
the new dormitories, The purpose of

On W&L Shoplifting,
Honor Code Validity

If you venture into the Co-op, bookstore or library of sev-
eral American colleges or universities, you would be shocked,

Spanish Inquisition.

course to curtail the spiralling rate of pilfering, shoplifting

“disappearances of |

On this page is a letter from an employee of the Book-
store. Briefly stated, that letter points to a growing problem.
Evidently, some expensive books are missing from the shelves
and there are no records indicating sales of these volumes.
The student employees of the Bookstore usually do not remain
at the counter like watchdogs, rather a great portion of their
labor is spent among the shelves or in the workroom. The
opportunity for “five finger discount” is virtually omni-present.

Along a similar vein, several reference books also “dis-
appeared” from McCormick Library last year. Many volumes
just could not be located in the Reference Room. Encyclo-
pedias were quite liable to be unavailable for use to interested
students.

The Bookstore and McCormick Library cannot smilingly
absorb such losses. Individuals at both locations are account-
able for these books. Their only alternatives to such problems
may be crackdowns on student privileges.

The central issue is not purging violators via honor trials.
It is facetious to believe that such a course of action will cause
the books to reappear or stop “disappearances” in the future.

Instead, the central issue must be will the W&L students
allow their privileges under the existing Honor System format
to “disappear” as these books have? Would you like shop-
lifting mirrors in the Bookstore? Does the idea of having un-
proctored exams appeal to you? Do you enjoy having your
word taken for the truth? Does it mean anything to you to
trust your fellow members of the Washington and Lee stu-
dent body?

If you value these privileges and traditions, then do some-
thing to preserve them. Rededicate yourself to the spirit of the
Honor System. That does not mean you automatically assume
the role of a Gestapo agent. It does mean conducting your-
self with honor and demanding that your fellow students do
the same. The alternatives are both plain and unappealing.

Thanks To V.M.L

Washington and Lee University and Virginia Military
Institute are not exactly intimate although their campuses
adjoin. The last football game between the colleges (around
the turn of the century) almost resulted in the leveling of
Lexington. Most W&L men do not know a single “Vemee”
and the closeness is reciprocated by many cadets.

But the university now stands in debt to VMI. While
Doremus Gymnasium is under construction, V MI has allowed
the boys from down the street to use their handball courts
and weights.

Over the last year a significant number of men have taken
advantage of this opportunity, The university itself conducts
Physical Education courses in handball at VMI.

When the new handball courts are ready for use in Dore-
mus sometime next month, the crowds will return to W&L
But it would be ungrateful to omit a word of thanks to VMI
for its tolerance, Therefore, VMI, thank you, Perhaps the two

The Spring Term this year will
see a second group of Washington
and Lee students studying in Europe,
sponsored by the foreign language
departments. This program, which
began last year, is open to students
of virtually any major, and is in
fact particularly beneficial to a non-
language major. Materials that a

student might never have access to
in the U.S. can be used while in
Europe, greatly enriching the stu-

dent's experience. The benefits for a
language major are obvious with the
constant contact of a foreign langu-
age and the chance to “live” a langu-
age, rather than just practice it. The
program then, has great potential
for all who participate.

To be eligible for the program, a
student must not be on academic
probation; he must be an upperclass-
man except in very special circum-
stances; and he must successfully
complete French 161-2, Spanish 161-

“Letting Go”’

 

BY LEX McMILLAN

The world stirred with the then
treacherous blasphemy of individual
freedom, equality and democracy.
Out of the turmoil was born Ameri-
ca of the Eighteenth Century. With
dreams once thought madness and
scoffed at by much of the rest of the
world America attempted to find a
method of government which would
forever rid men of monarchy and
selfish autocracy, In the dream was
the vision of a government which
would select leaders in such a way
as to draw out the very best men.
Through democracy and education
it was hoped that the most moral
most enlightened men would come
front to lead the people.

Those were the illusory days of
idealistic young radicals when the
country, as yet still struggling out of
the womb, was in a state of purity,
The purifying agent being flux and
turmoil, Men were performing at
their best because the ground be-
neath them constantly moved and
forced the heroic out of them,

Now our country is settled, The
wild savages have been fenced in,
the land “conquered”, the moon
brought to earth. Now in spite of a
new turmoil the leaders are compla
cent, overfed and entrenched. The
new rebellion is used to feed the
fears of the comfortable and further
guarantee the perpetuation of the
“established order”

Within that order is the well de
fined structure for election to high
office, specifically the Presidency. In
the tradition of government by the
people and stemming from the great
faith in the enlightening power of
education stands the institution of
the Washington and Lee Mock Con
vention

Proudly boasting its record of
realism the Mock Convention is a
stage play skillfully produced and di
rected by children in rigid and ob
edient immitation of their irrevoc
ably corrupt adult counterparts

The Convention system is so rigid
and calcified that it has shaken the
belief that any man can be Presi
dent. Any man cannot be President
Bright faces dart past our view and
are obliterated in the play of power
politics in our Corporate State. In
1968 there was the hope of men like

Robert Kennedy and Eugene Mc-
Carthy. One killed and the other ex-
cluded, The election was a non-
choice. One had the right to select
between two examples of mediocrity.

All indications are that in 1972
we will have the same lack of
choice. It also seems that this trend
will continue indefinitely with in-
creased rigidity. And of course our
Mock Convention will accurately
predict this. They will carefully
study the political situation in each
state, in the nation as a whole and
very like select the very man who
will be selected several months later
in the real convention, Won't that be
wonderful? Then W&L can proudly
sit back and chalk up another accur-
ate prediction to fortify its record of
realism. How utterly gratifying.
How positively exhilarating!

In so doing we help perpetuate
the corruption of the system. On the
other hand, why couldn't we at-
tempt to set a moral example? The
political situation could be studied
and realism strived for but at the
same time alternatives sought to our
present National Convention system.
With all the time, money and intelli-
gence which goes into a mimickry,
why couldn't W&L attempt to show
America that there might be a way
to again guarantee the people a real

2, or German 261-2, or the equiva-
lent. For the French and Spanish
program he must also have $1000,
for the German, $900.

If all requirements are met, he
must then be approved by the For-
eign Study Committee. A student
going on the program can expect to
spend most of his spring vacation in
Lexington doing extensive prepara-
tion for the trip.

While these trips are certainly an
excellent opportunity to have a great
time, there is still some work in-
volved. A project that is worth 3
credits in the student’s major field
must be planned and approved be-
fore departure, and executed during
free time in Europe, The program is
good for three additional credits in
the appropriate language, and is the
result of the classes and experience
that comes with the trip. Classes
generally occupy three hours every
morning, with visits to museums
some afternoons, and the theatre
and opera at nights, Otherwise there
is ample free time to work on pro-
jects and to enjoy the surroundings.
some weekends are reserved for
short trips, while others are free.

The French program is headquar-
tered at Reid Hall in Paris, a build-
ing that belongs to Columbia Uni-
versity. While students live with
families in Paris and eat breakfast
and dinner with them, they attend
their classes and eat lunch at Reid
Hall. Respected teachers give lec-
tures on contemporary theatre, mod-
ern art, and literature. Students
from the Sorbonne come for infor-
mal discussions,

Sex Book Ripped Off

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

Our society being what it is today
(which, according to one’s predilec-
tions, may mean virtually anything),
sex has become a topic both of
frank discussion and explicit pictor-
ials. The Bookstore has briefly ac-
quired one of these pictorials com-
plete with frank discussion. The Sex
Book: A Modern Pictorial Encycleo-
pedia has been published by Herder
& Herder, that once staid, straight-
lace religious publisher.

We quote Publisher’s Weekly:
“Werner Linz, vice president of
Herder, who was instrumental in

getting The Sex Book-originally pub-
lished in Germany—rewritten for
the U.S. and published here, calls it
‘pioneering in an area where major
re-education must take place.’ News-
week called it ‘bold and useful’;
Time said it was ‘explicit and hu-
mane’, we say simply that it is very
beautiful and about time.” Mr. Linz
is confident, by the way, that it will

 

g to kurope

While it costs more to be in Paris,
the French capital has everything

that the students need for their
studies and to keep them busy,
While. many Parisians speak Eng-

lish, and therefore oceasionally there
is slightly less opportunity to pract-
ice French, this factor is not of
major importance, as the program is
not solely for learning the language.

The Spanish program is located in
Madrid, and while prices are high,
the city has the best in museums,
theatre, folklore, and bullfights. The
students in Madrid also live with
local families, and attend the same
sort of classes as the French students
do. They attend the Institute Inter-
national with native instructors. Sev-
eral one day visits outside Madrid
are planned,

The German pregram is the only
one that is not located in a major
city. Because the students live in
Bayreuth, there is less and
more weekends are allowed for paid
travel. To get the feel of the larger
cities, the program spends the last
week or so seeing places such as
Munich. In Bayreuth students attend
classes at a teacher's college and
follow much the same routine in the
mornings as the other programs do.

Since Spring is still many months
away and students have not been
registered and approved for the pro-
gram, many details of the time spent
abroad, departure and return dates,
and the like have not been deter-
mined yet. In a few weeks, a meet-
ing will be held where all interested
students can talk with teachers and
“veterans” of the program.

‘The Birth of A Nation’ Shows

sGriffith’s Cinema Innovations

BY MARK McMINN

“The task I’m trying to achieve is
above all to make you see.”
D. W. Griffith

Not since the recent interment of
Traveller (hopefully for the last
time), has an event on this campus
been greeted with such enthusiasm
as was the September 20 screening
of D. W. Griffith's The Birth of A
Nation,

The SRO audience, comprised of
three generations, witnessed the
work of a primordial poet of sorts.
David Mark Griffith created the art
of film, refining many elements such
as the close-up, camera angle, edit-
ing and lighting into a new language,
a fresh syntax of cinema. The Birth
of A Nation is, in this sense, an ex-
ample of the contribution which
D. W. Griffith left to the world of
film.

Our schooling in the cinema has
been diametrically opposed, in ways,
to our education in the other arts,
ie., we tend to start with the pres-
ent and work toward the past. This
places us at a disadvantage in that
we tend to take for granted the dy-
namics of the close-up or a jump
cut, dismissing the early film-makers
as somewhat primitive.

Griffith had to overcome the ad-
vantage of the three dimensional
stage and develop a technique which
would impart, with effectiveness, his
imagination and perceptions onto
the two dimensional screen. He fre-
quently changed the position of his
camera, taking advantage of the
lighting, to give his characters a
greater dynamism. He would fill the
frame with face, be it the Little
Colonel or Elsie Stoneman, and
force the viewer to see only what he
wished him to see.

Likewise, he discovered that the
length of time a shot would appear
on the screen was directly propor-
tional to the tension it would pro-
duce: the shorter the shot, the great-
er the excitement. Thus, in the shot
of the Clansmen riding to the rescue
of the people in the shack, the emo-
tion of the audience was allowed to
rise as the climax neared,

Griffith was the first to utilize
the still photograph in the motion
picture. With the shot of the dead

25 YEARS GUARANTEE;

 

man on the battlefield, he was able
to convey to the viewer the feeling
that time no longer moved.

Griffith also possessed the ability
to avail himself of the audience’s
sense of equilibrium to the fullest
extent, establishing time and place
with a minimum of footage. He fre-
quently jumped from the middle of
one action to the middle of another
and yet the audience understood.

In his lifetime, David Mark Grif-
fith made some 432 films, sometimes
at the rate of two a week. No
theme was too ambitious for him;
and despite the fact that his films

The famous (or infamous) “War-
ren Court” is now dead, in case you
hadn't heard. The two vacancies to
be filled by the Nixon administra-
tion will make it a Nixon-dominat-
ed Court. This would indeed be un-
fortunate for the American people,
whether they think so or not at this
time.

Nixon and his various lackeys are
now involved in the process of ex-
cavating some suitably moderate
conservative and most especially
non-controversial men to fill the
seats left empty by Mr. Justice Har-
lan and the late Mr. Justice Black.
Chances are their replacements will
be mediocre, but then this would
make them fit in well with many
of the Nixon appointees in the Exe-
cutive branch of the government;
the President is consistent in some
things.

This would create a new-found
harmony between the Executive and
Judicial branches of the government,
most likely of a type that Richard

grossed over 60 million dollars, he
was unemployed at the end of his
life.

Nevertheless, James Agee wrote
of Griffith: “He was a primitive poet,
a man capable, as only great and
primitive artists can be, of intuitively
perceiving and perfecting the tre-
mendous magical images that under-
lie the memory and imagination of
entire peoples .. . There is not a
man working in movies, or a man
who cares for them, who does not
owe Griffith more than he owes
anybody else.”

The public saw and understood,

  

EES

Nixon wholly approves of as long as
he is President. FDR had somewhat
the same idea; he just went about it
in a more forward manner, which is
not the way Richard Nixon does
things.

The two new Justices will un-
doubtedly be somewhat to the right
of what is known as liberal; they
will probably be men who favored
the Lockheed loan, which is a good
example of the new version of “the
American Way” we all love so
dearly, in this case a matter of big
business influencing government
more than it should. Things such as
the Lockheed loan and certain in-
dustrial interests of long standing
which have managed to keep our
involvement in Indochina going
strongly have managed to change
the U.S. image around the globe in
a somewhat unfavorable way, Dollar
diplomacy just isn’t selling too well
any more,

But to get back to the supposed
subject of the Supreme Court, it
must be said that a conservative
leaning by the Court at this stage
of our nation’s development could
easily create in whole or in part
what many people, albeit ignorantly
for the most part, want at this time:
some form of a police state. This is
closely linked to the idea that “law
and order” is something which can
be maintained through force. It
can. A shining example of a govern-
ment which did this is Adolf Hitler's
Third Reich, to shoot again a very
dead but very true horse.

The idea of security for personal
material property has far overridden
the considerations the creators of
the U.S. Constitution and especially
the Bill of Rights were so careful to
insure: the rights of the individual
over against the society. A striking
observation I and many others have
made is that people, myself included,
usually acquiesce to the various
forms of repression imposed on us
until we AS INDIVIDUALS re-
ceive the proverbial shaft from the

the manners and mores of Life in

Returnees to the Heart of the

  

 

 

system, which I have found to be
happening to a lot of people lately.
Only when this occurs do we realize
that “law and order” is a very sharp
two-edged sword,

Granted it is in a few instances
necessary to tread on an individual's
rights for the protection of the rights
of “the many,” the exercise of such
power is constantly bordering on an
ever-changing fine line between jus-
tice and tyranny. It is the case of
using power for its own sake rather
than with a useful and good purpose
in mind,

Our prison system is a sparkling
example of what this kind of think-
ing can result in; there are a quar-
ter of a million people in prisons in
this country, and one and a half
million will pass in and out of penal
institutions during 1971, according
to the Associated Press. The indi-
vidual rights which should protect
these people as well as ourselves, are
what the “Warren Court” was pri-
marily concerned with. They recog-
nized a responsibility to the Con-
stitution at a time when “public
opinion” was in favor of taking a
somewhat different course for our
nation, back in the dark days of the
Cold War, Joe McCarthy and other
outstanding happenings of the
1950's. It is fortunate for us today
that while the legislative and execu-
tive branches of the government
were becoming increasingly involved
in what are termed “shady” activities
at the least, that the Judicial branch
could figuratively step out of the
situation and see our nation in a
more complete perspective, and
make their decisions from this ad-
vantageous viewpoint.

Doing this is the function of the
Court, though not many people
know it. The Court's decisions don't
seem to make sense at times, but
they are designed for long-term use
and most importantly to uphold the
Constitution as it applies to each of
us. As individuals this is made ob-

Blue Ridge Mountains will find a
few unusual things (newcomers will
find almost EVERYTHING unus-
ual). They are advised to retreat into
smug superiority, to try to become as
one with their environment, or for-
get about it.

Once again, many of the local eat-
eries have changed management.
One suspects that the same people
are always in control of the hash
houses, and they are simply playing
a game of Musical Cash Registers.

It will come as no surprise to me
(but then, what does, any more?)
that most of you have forgotten
what life here is really like.

However, after you have gotten
wall-eyed five times in a week, and
it’s only Tuesday, after you have sat
in a darkened movie house watching
“Bride of the Nephew of Franken-
stein’s Cleaning Lady Goes Ha-
waiian or Worse” so many times
you can chant the lines right along
with the best of them and are in
serious danger of O.D.ing on stale
popcorn; after you have gone down
the road so many times that the
faculties of Southern Sem, Hollins
and Sweet Briar are thinking of
charging you a matriculation and
off-campus student fee, then perhaps
you will remember.

By then, of course, it will be too
late, and the insidious plot laid
generations ago by Subversive
Forces posing as local rednecks,
carpetbaggers and other native fau-
na, a plot designed to take some of
America’s finest young minds (and
you thought that for a minute there
| was talking about YOU, right?
You should live so long) and turn
them into lifelong mental cripples,
birdbaths, or John Birchers, will
have claimed another victim.
However, by carefully following

 

the suggested activities presented
here by the editors of this paper, in
a humanitarian effort to save you
from yourself, you just might pull
through. Then again, you might not,
but at least this way you'll have a
sporting chance.

1, Go around in a_ three-piece
suit (preferably blue) and wingtip
shoes (preferably brown), Wear a
skinny tie. Tell everyone you see
that you are an Undercover Hippie.

2. Ask a policeman if the swal-
lows really aren't coming back to
Capistrano this year.

3. Write the words to the “W&L
Swing” on the head of a pin. Stick
yourself with it.

4. Call up any nearby airport
and ask them when the Hindenberg
dirigible is due to dock.

5. Stop someone on the street and
tell them that you are Calvin Cool-
idge. Ask if anyone’s missed you yet.

6. Go to someone’s house and
knock on the door, Tell them you
are there for the Venetian blind. If
they give you one of those things
hanging in the window, _ say,
“Thanks. This will buy a lot of
dark glasses and canes,”

7. Write Ann Landers and tell her
you know who she is, what she does,
and you have photos to prove it.
Really give her something to worry
about!

After spending a week or so con-
centrating on these pleasant, divert-
ing activities, you should be ready
for anything Lexington, Washington
and Lee, or anything else has to
offer. Doing them in two or three
days should prepare you for any-
thing the world has to offer. Doing
them all in one day should prepare
you for a nice session of shock
therapy.

Good luck!

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

BY BOB “LASH” LARUE

There’s no joy in Mudville, since
Casey Jones struckout. Translated in
1971, that line might read no joy in
Washington, D.C., since Bob Short
missed three straight. Never has the
Capital City been as furious since
the British burned the burg during
the War of 1812. Casting covetous
eyes towards the Lone Star State,
Short moved his baseball Senators to
Dallas—Fort Worth, the crossroads
best noted for right-wing politics
and cattle drives, respectively.

To be sure, there is method in
Short’s seeming madness, While the
switch may provoke some legislative
wrath, the baseball lobby will prob-
ably ease any political resentment by
moving the San Diego Padres into
Washington.

This turnabout is feasible despite
the avowed veto by Baltimore's
Jerry Hoffberger, whose action to is-

| aRue’s Pressbox
Senators to Dallas?

olate D. C. is effective only against
the movement of American League
teams. Much to Hoffberger’s regret,
the Padres belong to the National
League.

Anyway, Short’s withdrawal for
points west is probably a wise ven-
ture from a financial view. The Dal-
las-Fort-Worth fans who have been
brought up on a diet of minor lea-
gue baseball.

With the Houston Astros to the
south, the North Texans, who earl-
ier travelled to see the Dome, will
now be able to view major-league
teams in their neck of the woods. In
addition, the transplanted club will
atract baseball-crazy fans from the
adjoining states of Oklahoma and
Arkansas.

Secondly, Short would have been
committing economic suicide to stay
in RFK Stadium under the leasing
conditions provided by the D. C.
Armory Board. Granted, Short’s pe-
cuniary miscues accelerated his
crisis, but with the rental hardships
placed upon him by the stadium's
keepers, the retreat would have been
a mere matter of time.

However, the lords of baseball
should not let Washington suffer the
permanent loss of its team. A Wash-
ington without baseball is as custo-
mary as Hollywood without movies
and movie stars. San Diego, a desert
in an oasis of baseball teams, has

Junior quarterback Steve Fluharty races out of the pocket to gain yardage in W&L’s 10-7 loss to Towson
State, Fluharty was hurt on the play and sophomore Lewis Powell guided the offense the remainder of the game.

Towson State Scores In Final
Minutes Hands W&L 10-7 Loss

BY LEWIS HIXSON

The Washington and Lee Gen-
erals lost a close game in the final
minutes last Saturday against Tow-
son by a 10 te 7 score. The Gen-
erals led by a 7 to 3 margin for
most of the game until Bobby Roche
passed to Stu Remeto for a 13 yd.
score with 2:26 left in the fourth
quarter. John Glass added the extra
point to give Towson a 10 to 7 lead
and eventually the game.

The Generals received the open-
ing kickoff and John Loesing re-
turned it 18 yds. to the 35. Jim
Farrar was then sent into the line 3
straight times gaining 12 yds. and a
first down. Steve Fluharty went to
the air, after a 2 yd. loss by JoJo
Martin on a pitchout, but was un-
successful and W&L was forced
to kick it away. Chappy Conrad
punted 44 yds. to the Towson 16
where Mike Wells fielded it and
returned it to his own 30, The Gen-

eral defense then started off the
season on the right foot by holding
the Tigers to 1 yd. on their first 3
downs and forcing them to punt it
away. Dave Brooks received the
punt on his own 33 yd. line and
returned it 24 yds. to the Towson
43. With the ball in good field posi-
tion the Blue were able to gain only
2 yds. in 3 downs as 2 Fluharty
passes fell incomplete. Conrad never
got his punt away as the Tigers
came through to block it and obtain
good field position in General ter-
ritory at the 36. Richard Young and
David Franklin then combined their
running ability to move the ball to
the Generals 17 yd. line. The Blue
defense then got it together and
stopped the Tigers to make it 4th
down and 9 yds. to go. In came
John Glass for a field goal attempt.

His kick was true and with 6:42 re-
maining in the Ist period, the Tigers
lead 3 to 0.

Neither team was able to score
the rest of the first period. Near the
end of the second period Steve Flu-
harty was racked up after gaining
7 yds. and was forced to leave the
game. Lewis Powell was sent in with
the ball on the W&L 36 to re-
place Fluharty. Powell then pro-
ceeded to move the Generals down-
field hitting on almost every pass to
such receivers as Conrad, Martin,
and Lane. Then with two seconds re-
maining in the half, Powell found
Martin in the end zone with a 10
yd. scoring pass. Doug Chase boot-
ed the extra point and the Generals
held a 7-3 halftime lead.

Towson then kept W&L in the
hole on two series of downs under
the leadership of Mike Ciceie. The
General defense then made a terrific
goal line stand holding the Tigers to
no yards in 4 plays.

Towson then kept W and L in the
hold on two series of downs until a
beautiful 52 yd. punt by Conrad put
them back in their own territory.
Both teams were unable to gain any
advantage until late in the 4th quar-
ter when Towson got the ball on
their own 32 after a Conrad punt.
With Bob Roche at the helm again,
the Tigers drove deep into the Gen-
erals territory. On 4th down 7 yds,
to go on the General 13 yd. line,
Roche dropped back and hit Reme-
fo with a pass in the end zone for a
score. Glass added the point after,
and with 2:26 remaining in the

Booters Fall 2-1
On Ref’s Error

Sentiments and anger flew last
Saturday afternoon when Dickinson
captured a non-league game from
the Washington and Lee soccer
squad by a disputed 2-1 margin, in
the second overtime period.

It was an offside call against Bill
Spofford that nullified his go-ahead
goal and sent the game into over-
time. What really handed insult to
injury was the fact that the referee
who initially called the infraction
later admitted the call was wrong
but could not change his mind.

The game began completely in
the Generals’ hands. A quick, aggres-
sive offense, controlled from the
wings, kept Dickinson on the de-
fense the entire first half. The total
number of shots taken by W&L
climbed near fifty. Junior co-cap-
tains Meade Kampfmuller, left wing,
and Brandon Herbert, half-back, led
the brigade.

Neither team scored until the sec-
ond half when sophomore Bill Spof-
ford laid a beautiful center from
Kampfmuller in the corner of the
goal, Dickinson did manage to move
against the half-backs on defense,
and they scored soon afterwards on
a penalty kick. Then came Spofford’s
disputed goal. Amidst continued ar-
guments, the referee admitted he
was wrong. Holding to the “Ref’s
Golden Rule”, he wouldn’t change
his initial call.

The first overtime saw little of-
fense, but it was evident the Gen-
erals were fired up. With only two
minutes remaining in the second

VMI Bounces
Ruggers, 14-0

A powerful, well-disciplined VMI
rugby squad took advantage of a
lack of leadership to whip the
Washington and Lee Rugby Club
14-0 last Saturday in a preseason
scrimmage.

Leadership and size, coupled with
the General's inexperience, were the
names of the game as the Coley
Roffo led Keydets displayed a merci-
less defense and a quick offense. The
Generals were definitely at a disad-
vantage even before the game had
begun, having had only four squad
practices beforehand and having lost
a few essential players to conflicting
outside activities.

VMI's size helped make their de-
fense impenetrable to any type of
offense the Generals could muster.
VMI stuck for four early tries and
one out of three extra points. A try
is equivalent to a touchdown in
football but is worth only three
points. The extra points are worth
two a piece. The scrimmage was not
played at full period time and it
last about one hour, Because of the
lack of any preparation the W&L
scoring machine continually bogged
down. Some of the members were
playing in their first rugby match
and were not familar with rules or
game conditions. Notable standouts

WA&L goalie Jim Kahn lunges in a futile attempt to stop a penalty
kick. The goal was Dickinson’s first as they went on to win 2-1 in
double overtime.

overtime, Dickinson managed their
winning goal on persistent net shots.
W&L did not give up as_ they
mounted a flurry of goal shots with
less than one minute to play. But
the clock was not generous enough
and Dickinson emerged the 2-1
victors.

Shouts of protesting the game
were heard immediately after, but
rules forbid the protest of a soccer
game. As any type of consolation,
the match was only a non-league
scrimmage.

Look for only good things to im-

merge from the soccer fields this
year. Standouts in this contest were
the goalie, Jim Kahn; right wing,
Mike Schaeffer; full-back, Rolf Pir-
anian; along with Spofford, Kampf-
mueller, and Brandon. The squad
fields five freshmen as starters, all of
whom have had previous soccer ex-
perience in high school. These young
hopefuls include John Embree,
Jimmy Fox, Gardner Britt, all line-
men, and backfield men Barclay
Armstrong and Chuck Alexander.
The team faces Madison away this
Friday.

vious by looking back at public re-
action to major decisions in the past
twenty or so years, which has been
on the whole quite unfavorable. But
the Supreme Court cannot be con-
cerned with public opinion and its
primary victim: the politically con-
trolled segments of our government,
which include everything but the Su-
preme Court at most times. The nine
Justices must consider the good of
the country in the long run. If you
can lose your probably bloated sense +
of self-importance in this nation you
can begin to realize the manner in
which the Justices must think.

For this reason [| can only hope
that Richard Nixon, by some quirk
of fate, will come up with qualified
men to fill the seats, though this
doesn't seem to be in the offing. If
he doesn’t, Nixon will only be bring-
ing us much closer to the day when
we must face the somewhat ultimate
question of whether or not the Unit-
ed States is to be what it COULD
be: the greatest government in the
history of man.

What we have now is no better
than Rome in the days of its deca-
dent Empire, to shoot another dead
horse. The icing on our cake at this

Tom Gillespie, Co-Chairman of
the 1972 Mock Convention, an-
nounced the appointment of several
students to be chairmen of ten state
delegations to the Mock Convention
next May. Senior David Harbert
will have the task of predicting Cali-
fornia’s June winner-take-all primary
for 271 delegate votes. 1950 are re-
quired to nominate. Senior law stu-
dent Louis Flynn is Connecticut
Chairman. His real counterpart is
John Bailey, who once rallied New
England delegates to John F. Ken-
nedy before becoming Democratic
National Chairman.

Florida delegates, chosen in an
early mandatory primary, will be led
by Duncan Pace and Jim Swann.

and the tournament at the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology, in
Cambridge, on November 1-2, One
of the most honored of these tour-
naments will be the one at Chapel
Hill, since the hosts presently reign
as national champions.

All in all, the W&L team antici
pates a successful season. “I think
we can almost guarantee ourselves
a place in the top ten of at least
half of the tournaments,” remarked
Harkey. Certainly the packed sche-
dule assures the squad the abun-
dance of experience that any young
team needs to restore a national rep-
utation.

ley, once described as “the only
American politician with an Oriental
mind.” Gentry Ferrell and Mike
Brooks will be co-chairmen for In-
diana, another primary state. Brooks,
the son of the Democratic nominee
for mayor of Evansville, Indiana,
will also lead the campus efforts on
behalf of Senator Birch Bayh.

Archer Frierson and Ken Murov
are co-chairmen for Louisiana. Mike
Agee will lead Maine delegates for
their favorite son, Senator Edmund
Muskie. Freshman Ben Sherman is
Minnesota Chairman, a Humphrey
supporter, who acknowledges that
former Senator Eugene McCarthy is
still a strong favorite of a wide seg-
ment of his native DFL Party.

Texas delegates will be led by
Brian Grieg and John Keck. Robert
Giammittorio, a law school junior,
is making his second appearance as
a state chairman, this time for his
native Virginia, At the last Mock
Convention he led GOP delegates
for Alaska’s favorite son, Walter
Hickel.

NOTICE

There will be a meeting of the
Washington and Lee Ecology Club
at 6:45 p.m. on Tuesday in Room
112 of the Student Center. This is a
permanent meeting time. We need
new members so that we can expand
our activities, so please come if you
are interested.

“Letting Go”

Letters

' To the Editor

(Continued from page 2)
Lexington’s Registrar of Voters, not
allowing students to register to vote
unless they first file a declaration of
personal property with the Commis-
sioner of Revenue.

The rationale is this: City govern-
ment is largely, perhaps even pri-
marily, the matter of finances—how
to raise money (and how much), and
on what to spend it. A man or wom-
an whether a student or not, who
refuses to accept his or her full
share of the burden, including pro-
perty taxes, has neither the right nor
the business demanding a say-so in
how to use the money of those of
us who do accept that responsibility.

It seems to me that you are de-
manding—lI infer that you are de
manding, from your statement that
“the battle,” as you choose to call
it, remains to be won—it seems to
me that you are demanding that
Lexington extend the franchise to
students but exempt them from the
obligation that legally binds the rest
of us to declare our property (that is
to say: declare its eligibility to be
taxed), The result of that, of course,
would be to create two distinct
classes of citizens—those on the one
hand, students for instance, who
are granted representation but with
de facto immunity from taxation,
and, on the other hand, everybody
else,

If a student who can demonstrate
electoral eligibility in every other
respect wishes to vote in Lexington
—and surely every such student
should wish to vote here: after all,
students have to pay the local sales
tax and the city car-tag fee, and so
students already have a small vested
interest in the city’s management—
then that student, like every other
Lexington resident, must declare his
personal property (and pay his taxes
on it). It is as simple as that. And
once he does, once he vests as com-
plete an interest in this city’s man-
agement as the law requires of every
other bona fide resident, then the
Registrar of Voters must enroll him.
That, too, is as simple as that.

choice. Instead, will we go along the
well worn path and like marionettes
serve to further endorse and prolong
the life of an American institution
which no longer serves the people?

It would be a great challenge and
a great moment if Washington and
Lee when briefly thrust out of its
usual obscurity into national atten-
tion were to show the nation a new
path rather than a mirror image of a
scene already too well known.

near there in order to replace the
woefully inadequate facility still be-
ing used in Richmond.

Slayton recounted his efforts at
mustering popular support for pri-
son reform by admitting numerous
news media personnel who produced
feature stories and T.V, documen-
taries on the deficiencies of the pres-
ent facilities.

Supt. Slayton indicated that over-
crowding; unsuitable design of the
interior of the prison; and the diffi-
culty of employing enough staff
members in view of budgetary con-
siderations all combined to create an
atmosphere of mere crisis solution
and custody rather than true re-
habilitation.

The questioning students bore
down heavily on the lack of criminal
procedure books in the prison li-
brary; the alleged inadequacy of the
administrative procedure by which
“good time” reduction decisions are
made; and the absolute necessity of
forcefully selling the concept of pri-
son reform to the general public.
