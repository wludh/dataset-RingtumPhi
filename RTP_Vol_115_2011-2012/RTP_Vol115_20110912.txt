 Not your grandparents’

Johnson gift, Strategic Plan lead to record ﬁrst-year class and changing demographics

By Kelly Mae Ross
STAFF WRITER

The 259 men and 238 women who just experi-
enced their ﬁrst Washington and Lee Orientation
Week have already secured a place in the school’s
history: the class of 2015 is the largest ever to walk
the Colonnade. ‘

To put this 497-student class into perspective, the
class of 2014 had 471 students as of October 2010,
the class of 2013 had 472 as of October 2009, and
the class of 2012 had 454 as of October 2008.

Provost Robert Strong says the larger-than-
average class size was not intended. The school’s
yield—the percentage of accepted students who de-

cided to attend W&L—went up this year, resulting
in the larger freshman class.

The yield for Johnson scholarship offers also in-
creased. The class of 2014 has 34 Johnson scholars
in it, while this year’s freshman class has 53. lfyou
average these two numbers, you get about 44 John-
son scholars per class, which is the target that the
university shoots for each year.

Going co—ed

W&L is changing. Data collected by the univer-
sity show a steady evolution of the student body
since 1985—the ﬁrst year women were admitted to
W&L.

In 1985, 105 freshmen women and 10 upper-
class women transfer students began attending
classes at W&L, according to an article from The
Washington Postpublished in September 1985.

Today, more than 25 years later, women make
up almost exactly 50 percent of the undergraduate
degree-seeking population. According to data from
the Ofﬁce of Institutional Effectiveness’ Common
Data Sets, women overtook men as the majority of
the undergraduate degree-seeking population for the
ﬁrst time at the start of the 2009-2010 school year.
The student population that year was 49.86 percent
male and 50.14 percent female. With such a small
total student body, however, for all intents and pur-

poses the split was 50/50 that academic year and last
academic year (2010-201 1) as well.

Back in 1985, not everyone was excited about
the change. According to the same Washington Post
article, then-student body president John B. Lewis
said he felt “betrayed” by the school because he be-
lieved changes to the campus were being made too
quickly.

In an opinion piece published last year, fonner
student Michele Farquharson said that her own fa-
ther was originally against the idea of coeducation
at W&L, even going so far as to adhere ‘a bumper
sticker to his car that read “W&L,
Better Off Dead than Co-ed.”

In 1985, women made up about
8.5 percent of the undergraduate
' student population. But the male to
female ratio has been close to 1:1 for
several years now, and the university
has begun to focus its efforts on di-
versifying the W&L student body in
other ways, according to the univer-
sity’s strategic plan.

The Strategic Plan

In 2007, the university revealed a

plan outlining its goals for the next
decade of new student recruitment
and other aspects of running the uni-
versity.
I Debbie Dailey, assistant provost
10 for the university’s Ofﬁce of Institu-
tional Effectiveness, compiles and analyzes the de-
mographics ofthe university each year. She said she
hasn’t noticed any big changes.

She did say that a more diverse student body has
been a goal of university administrators ever since
she began working here four years ago.

“I think a lot ofeffort is being expended by W&L
to increase the diversity of the student body,” said
Dailey. But she also

undergone “dramatic changes” over the past decade.
According to the May 201 1 Board Book-- prepared
for the Board ofTrustees --in the year 2000 the uni-
versity allocated $10.3 million to its ﬁnancial aid
budget. By 2010. that number had more than tripled
to $34.1 million.

This year’s ﬁnancial aid budget, which has not
been ﬁnalized, sits at about $32 million, says James
Islaster, Director of liinancial Aid at “W&L.

Kaster says the university is “absolutely” offer-
ing more need-based aid now than it has in the past,
thanks in large part to the Johnson gift.

says that because of the program W&L is “compet-

was before.

The timing of the Johnson gift allowed the uni-
versity to continue to offer higher levels of ﬁnancial
aid despite the downturn in the economy.

“It’s a big commitment,” Kaster says. But, he
adds, “the university is beneﬁtting like crazy from

According to Strong, Johnson scholars had an
average GPA of 3.642 after last winter term. Of
the 20 students inducted _into the Phi Beta Kappa
academic honor society last year, 11 were Johnson
scholars, and half of the students inducted into the
Omicron Delta Kappa national leadership honor so-
ciety were Johnson scholars.

That doesn‘t mean Johnson scholars are the only
movers and shakers on campus. But Kaster says
that the university’s ability to bring in brighter and
brighter Johnson scholar students spurs the entire
W&L student body to strive for academic improve-
ment.

Dailey says she believes the university is “mak-
ing great efforts to enhance [the] experiences of
students by increasing the diversity that is here,”
largely through the Johnson Scholarship program.

“[W&L] is diverse,” says Kaster. “You have to
think ofthe history."

Extreme home makeover: Washington and Lee edition

English department, Alpha Delta Pi and ﬁeld hockey team get new homes thanks to summer construction projects

By Leigh Dannhauser
5 TA F F w R I T E R

Returning students may have noticed a slightly
modiﬁed campus, thanks to Washington and Lee‘s
annual summer makeover.

Payne Hall, the English depar1m'ent’s home
on the Colonnade, now features two refurbished
classrooms, the department library, larger ofﬁces,
wheelchair access to the ﬁrst floor, a separate con-
ference room on the ﬁrst floor and a student lounge
area on the second ﬂoor.-

“For the ﬁrst time, English faculty can meet stu-
dents inappropriately sized, comfortable offices.
A more professional atmosphere has been created,
without sacriﬁcing comfort,” said department chair
Suzanne Keen. .

Keen said she hopes the lounge will encourage
students to spend more time in the building. “We

see the renovated building as a home for the liter-
ary arts,” she said. . ‘

Meanwhile, the restoration of Washington Hall
is underway. The project will be similar to the res-
toration of Newcomb and Payne halls. Unlike those
buildings, the refurbished Washington Hall will
feature an “Honored Benefactors Wall,” according
to a W&L news release.,The wall will contain the
names ofthose individuals who have given $1 mil-
lion or more to the school.

Away from‘ the Colonnade, the women ofAlpha
Delta Pi ﬁnally moved into their newly completed
house.

“lt’s nice having a place to.call your own,” said
sophomore Bella Zuroski.

During their ﬁrst couple of years on campus,

members of ADPi lived on a designated hall in
Gaines. Chapter meetings were held in the Hillel
House on Mondays, and the sisters had chapter din-
ners together on Tuesday nights in the Kappa Delta
house.

The house “brings it all together,” Zuroski said.

On the athletic front, the ﬁeld hockey turf was
replaced this summer.

The Generals continue to compete on a carpet

turf, the only team to do so in the Old Dominion

Athletic Conference. Other teams in the conference
use ﬁeld turf, similar to the football turf, on which
the ball is slower.

, Although the same type ofturf is used, the new
turf has its differences. The old turf, which was
also used for intramurals and as the alternate ﬁeld

for soccer, football and lacrosse, had worn down.
There also have been improvements in the produc-
tion of the surface since the old turf was installed
ten years ago.

A major difference is the addition of a sprinkler
system. The turf gets watered before each game to
make it safer for the players.

“The water makes it safer for your face, and if
you fall you don’t get burnt,” said sophomore de-
fender Riley Hampsch.

The next game on the new turf is September
l7 at 2 p.m.

Rules are rules for a reason  

Campbell Burr explains how following the system helped her escape unwanted attention at work and in school

My ﬁrst day
of work, my
boss told me that
my pants were
too tight.

, Yes, they
. were skin-tight,
but that’s how
they were «sup-
posed to ﬁt. I
was informed
- that I was in
violation of the
restaurant’s rule
that all bussers
and servers were
to wear “docker” style slacks, a.k.a.
the most unflattering, shapeless pants
in the world. Considering I was work-
ing for tips, not a hospital, the restric-
tion seemed a little counterproductive.
To add insult to injury, on top we wore
short-sleeved button-down shirts a la
1998 Limited Too. Yuck. Going into the
summer, I couldn’t imagine why some-
one in a position of authority would
want to put me through such torture.

As my summer unfolded, I began to
understand. Among the mostly normal,
friendly wait and kitchen staff, I dis-
covered a few characters who gave me
pause. Bill, a bartender in his late ﬁf-
ties, was one of these creepers. He was
balding on either side of his head and
had wide arms that would have looked

large, round belly protruded from under-
neath each of his Hawaiian shirts. An-
other busgirl had been forbidden from
going near the bar because Bill had once
ordered that she turn around so he could
give her a neck massage. Rumor had it
that he had asked another young employ-
ee on a date. Because one of my respon-
sibilities as a busgirl was bringing dirty

comment came lots of genuine compli-
ments. I could not decide whether to be

weird-

ness was only his odd sense of humor
and I blamed myself for thinking that his
words were creepy rather than ﬁinny. On
my second night of work, Bill watched
from behind the bar as I stacked glasses
by the dishwasher. “Give it to me baby,”
he said in a deep, raspy voice.

,When I looked up, a little taken
aback, he continued. “You can take that
anyway you want.” Not knowing how
to react, I looked down and smiled.

given him a greener light if I tried.

Bill’s next move was begging me to
run away with him. For a week, every

On one horrible occasion, Bill
teamed up with Jeff, a short waiter in his
forties who was also anxious to speak to
young waitresses. Another busgirl and
I were preparing to clear a table while
Bill and Jeff began jokingly ﬁghting.
We had trays and towels and were on the
way out to the dining room when Bill
stopped us.

and whip Jeff with them.”

Jeff smiled at us and then looked
back at Bill. “The only problem, Bill, is
that I would really enjoy that.” Eeek.

“What are your tattoos?” I
asked.

“Oh, well this one on my left
arm is of the Grim Reaper, got it
after my divorce. And my other
one,” he said as he inched his
shirt to expose his left chest—
very appropriate for work—“is a
heart with my children’s names
in the center.” His children, apparently,
had been estranged for four years.

Later on that night, he asked if I was
considering getting a tattoo. I told him
no, but he made it his goal for the night
to recommend a design and placement
that I would like. His ﬁrst recommenda-
tion was a picture of the globe on my
ankle. “For Earth Day,” he said. Riiiight.
When I told him I enjoyed reading and
writing, he suggested a tattoo of my
favorite book open on my arm. “Some-
thing meaningful,” he explained. I can-
not even repeat Bill’s ﬁnal tattoo recom-
mendation.

Sweetheart say the word “like” during
the millionth argument between herself
and Ronnie? In addition, how much are
these fools getting paid to drink, party,
ﬁght and not speak Italian?

The answer is simple. The “Snitch-
uation” has reportedly brokered a deal
with MTV that will land each cast mem-
ber $100,000 an episode for a thirteen
episode season. If you thought you had
it good going to a top liberal arts institu-
tion, think again.

If only I were Italian, I could have
pretended to be from New Jersey and
ruined a perfectly good family beach
Vacation spot. I instead took the color-
ful route of being Irish and pursuing an
accounting degree. I am so interesting.
Child please.

OK, enough with the hatred. I actu-
ally enjoy the show and have been an
avid viewer since day one. Since we
are all fans of the beloved show, I am
sure we have all seen the trailer display-
ing highlights of the upcoming season.

There were some pretty shocking and
graphic events that presented them-
selves in this preview.

Since the entire world (and your sis-
ter’s sister) heard news earlier this year
that Snooki ran her car into the back of
a police car, the trailer had to show foot-
age of this event. In classic style, Snoo-

lenses are actually slabs of black plastic.
In the world of eyewear, this would be
classiﬁed as a “sleeping mask.”
Footage in the trailer also shows a
fairly intense verbal argument between
the Situation and Ronnie that appears
to turn into a physical altercation. Ob-
viously no punches are shown in the

tion for the ladies, and Snooki does not matter. Ever.

ki stopped paying attention to the road
just long enough to ram her vehicle into
a Florence policeman’s rear, ricocheting
it into a nearby guardrail. The cause of
this accident is unclear, although early
speculation shows that Snooki’s sun-
glasses are so deeply tinted that the

preview, but we do see the Situation
unconscious and lying on the ground ac-
companied by paramedics. I think it’s
safe to say that Ronnie’s record has just
improved to 4-0 with three knockouts
lifetime.

The episode portraying this ordeal

A week from my last day, Bill called
me over to the bar to share an idea he
had. He suggested that instead of thank-
ing each other every time he took a glass
off of my tray, we say something else.
When he shared his idea for that “some-
thing else,” I did not smile. Rather, I
considered suggesting an addendum
to the employee code that consisted of
forbidding makeup and requiring cen-
ter hair parts. If I was getting this much
unwanted attention looking like an old
maid, I could not imagine what would
have ensued had I dressed in my pre-
ferred clothing.

My take-away from the summer: the
rules are there for a reason. Naturally,
we complain about some of the rules
at W&L—no smoking in the donns, no
kegs in fraternity houses, no open con-
tainers on Traveller—but they may be
important to follow. Dressing in baggy
clothes every day for work was about
as frustrating as pouring out a full beer
to get on Traveller. Yes, the restaurant
could have just ﬁred Bill, but in an ef-
fort to complicate things, I’ll give them
the beneﬁt of the doubt and be grateful
for my restrictions. 1 can only hope that
such inconvenience in my life staves off
at least some unwanted attention, be it
from a possible pedophile or the good
old Lexington Police.

Jersey  

aired last week, and one can ﬁnally see
how manipulative and nasty MTV actu-
ally is. They led us to believe that this
would be the ﬁght of the century, while
in fact the Situation was the one who
knocked his own ass out. In a ﬁt ofrage,
a verbal altercation turned into a head
butt of a concrete wall.

TKO. Kiss the baby.

Aside from this ﬁght, the season
has been fairly plebian. J-Woww, also
known as J-Care Face, has seemed to
turn into a skeleton over night. Vinny is,
and will always be, a snide little trouble-
maker who everyone loves. Pauly D is
the shit and I would buy him a beer any
day of the week, even on the Sabbath.
Deena seems to have grown a particular
appreciation for the ladies, and Snooki
does not matter. Ever.

Tune in to the Jersey Shore Septem-
ber l5th. Trust me, I’m from Jersey.

Forced consumerism challenge in Virginia

John ‘Paul Beall explores constitutional issues surrounding the challenges and protections of the healthcare law

This last
week the 4th
Circuit Court
of Appeals
in Richmond
heard two chal-
lenges to the
Healthcare Act,
sparking con-
troversy. Over
the last year,
several attempts
against the law
have been made
in Federal Cir-
cuit Courts of
Appeals with mixed results. The 6th

l Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati
upheld the disputed law in a 2-1 ruling
in June, and the 11th Circuit Court in At-
lanta ruled against the law, 2-1. The 4th
Circuit Court ruled that a case against
the law could not be made until some-
one had received a penalty for refusing
purchase of health insurance.

COLUMNIST

The court ruled in favor of the law
on grounds that judges are forbidden
by federal law from ruling on tax chal-
lenges until the tax is collected, adding
yet another layer to an issue. already
riddled with layers of Constitutional and
ideological elements. Opponents of the
Court’s ruling expected the federal court

not owning insurance would be based
on taxable income, the ﬁne inflicted on
non-owners is in fact a tax. Furthermore,
Motz states that the law strips all judges
of the right to make a ruling on the mat-
ter until the law is in effect. Judge James
Wynn concurred, stating his belief that
the law was constitutional; Judge Andre

dent that the high court will ultimately
uphold the law and rule that Congress
has broad power to regulate the health

are high for the Obama administration.

Whether or not the penalty is
a tax, the fact still remains that
the core of the issue is not one of taxes,
but one of Constitutional interpretation.
The broad interpretation of the Interstate
Commerce Clause (Article 1, Section 8,
Clause 3) and the Elastic Clause (Article
1, Section 8, Clause l8) has reached a
new frontier under the Healthcare Act.

Proponents of the law claim that Con-
gress has such power over the regulation
of interstate commerce that it can force
every able citizen in the United States
to purchase a good or service in spite of
preference. ’

Frankly, that argument does not
stand well to begin with, since insurance
policies vary state by state and are of-
ten non-transferable across state borders
because of state laws. Those laws are a
restriction of interstate commerce and a
violation of the ﬁill faith and credit that
states are supposed to have for items
from other states. Yet as long as those
laws exist, I question whether insur-
ance markets can truly be considered,
interstate commerce, since current in-
frastructure clearly favors the states in
the issue. Regardless of personal belief,
this controversy is but one more reason
that the 2012 Election (and the upcom-
ing Mock Convention) will be exciting,
interesting and important.

ColumnistAli Greenberg pleads for the women of W&L to end the hate and be the change they wish to see on campus

Partially

year, here is

revised ver-
sion of an

" " ;.' article that

By All reenberg was quoted

COLUMNIST in the New
York Times.

It is my understanding that a school
paper should be a medium to discuss
things that are actually current and im-
portant on campus, so I ﬁgure, why not
take a shot at a serious article. Start the
year off with a bang while at least the
freshmen are still reading the Phi.

From gender relations to inter-Greek
camaraderie to our attitudes about drink-
ing and partying, we have very twisted
perceptions about campus life at Wash-
ington and Lee. And these issues are just
that: self—evident truths that can be hard
to accept and harder to ﬁght or change.

We live in a warped reality. A bubble.
And while I may joke about the differ-
ences between Yankees and debs, the
differences are very real. Similar di-
vides persist between those who come
from private or public schools, white
and multicultural students, and Greeks
and independents.

These divides are generally unspo-
ken. They seem to exist without rules
or formal segregation, yet the social at-
titudes and cultural or background dif-
ferences remain ever apparent.

One of the largest divides I ﬁnd is
the one between those who claim to be
united. Within and between our Greek
organizations there is tension, especially
in the Panhellenic community. And as
much as it hurts me to admit _it, I am of-
ten disappointed by the nature of lunch
and dinner discussions at the sorority
houses.

The former conversations generally
follow a “boys and beer” pattern, while
the latter usually consist of talking about
other girls. And while this obviously
isn’t all we talk about, I have heard and,
admittedly, taken part in many con-
versations of girls judging other girls.
“Do you think she is pretty?,” “She
gets around,” “Why

we need to recognize this and make a
change. Treating each other like lesser
beings by making generalizations and
judgments about groups or individuals
is wrong and should stop. We are better
than that.

In the words of the Reverend Jeremi-
ah Wright, “Different does not mean de-
ﬁcient, it just means different.” We are
neither better nor worse than each other.
Not everything has to be black and white
in the sense of prettier or uglier, fatter
or skinner, smarter or dumber, better or
worse.

When we ﬁnally recognize this, may-
be we can realize that we all have bigger
issues at hand to be dealing with. Like

turn south.

I cannot wrap my head around why
we participate in negative and detri-
mental conversations. Perhaps because
it makes ourselves feel better, because
we ﬁnd it funny or harmless, or maybe
we are simply bored. Whatever the rea-
son, it is clear that we have all forgotten
about the Golden Rule.

So the next time you sit down at srat
dinner, try to talk about politics or sports
or clothing or travel. You can talk about
food, sex, books, class, celebrities, any-
thing. Just don’t talk about each other.
Don’t call someone your best friend and
say you love her to death even though
she is a total bitch.

Because when

are guys into her? I
just don’t see it,” or
“Who is the pretti-
est girl in that pledge
class?”

Rarely are there
complimentary con-
versations about girls
for something other
than being thin or
dressing well. For-
get about being acknowledged for be-
ing smart, a leader on campus or a kind
person.

If another girl dates your ex, you are
automatically “so much cuter than her,”
especially considering that she became a
slut and a bitch overnight.

Ladies, the problem with gender rela-
tions on our campus starts with us. We
treat each other with little to no respect,
and give so little credit to those outside
our inner circle.

We can be mean, mean girls, and

Rarely are there ‘complimentary conversations
about girls for something other than being thin or 1
dressing well. Forget about being acknowledged for
being smart, a leader on campus or a kind person.

President Obama said: “We do not have
time for this kind of silliness. We have
more important things to do.”

We are students, sisters, daughters,
leaders, employees, athletes, presidents,
volunteers and friends. We are all strong
individuals who have something to of-
fer. So why can’t we show that?

There is nothing fundamentally
wrong with sitting around and shooting
the shit every now and then with a little
light gossip. But it is when the conversa-
tions turn into a roast that things take a

you do this, you be-
come the total bitch.
And if I were a guy,
wouldn’t respect
any girl who treated
her “friends” with as
little respect as we do
most days. We blame
everything on the
boys, but we don’t
take accountability
for our own actions and realize that we
are putting forth negative perceptions
about others and ourselves.

We sit there and listen as others lam-
bast our peers. Sometimes we partake.
Sometimes we walk away. But it is
rare that someone ever says, “Let’s talk
about something more positive”.

We cannot put all the blame for gen-
der relations on the high sexual assault
rate or the lack of women on the E.C.
We have the ability to make this school
a better place, a better environment for

women. All it takes is being nicer to one
another, and actually supporting each
other instead of tearing each other down.

Because, to be honest, to an outside
observer, we come off as privileged,
selﬁsh and spoiled; We seem to have
inﬂated egos and elevated opinions of
ourselves, and for what? Because we got
into W&L we are suddenly better than
others? Because we got into a “higher-
ranking” sorority we are cooler or pret-
tier or better?

I am going to let everyone in on a se-
cret. While you may be making friends
for a lifetime, or establishing a network
for later job or social opportunities, what
organization you were in and whether or
not you were “cool” in college, doesn’t
really matter in the real world. It just
doesn’t. No one cares.

What people care about is your char-
acter: your kindness, your honesty, your
consideration and your trust. These are
the traits we are supposed to be building
here as well-rounded students.

We all, myself included, contribute
to this negativity at one time or anoth-
er, which is why I used the royal “we”
throughout this article (or technically
the editorial “we” in this case.) And if
I am able to admit that this behavior is
wrong, we should all be able to take a
step back and seriously reassess our ac-
tions.

So let’s ﬁx this. Let’s stop the silli-
ness and the sassiness. This is a brand-
new year. Let’s make conscious efforts
to be kinder, to be positive, to not make
judgments, to be nice girls. Because at
the end of the day, it is always better to
kill them with kindness.

Textbooks: a thing of the past‘?

Sally Platt explores the beneﬁts of trading in printed books for a lighter, greener and newer option of e-books

By Sally Platt
COLUMNIST

. Last Thursday, as I lugged home an
impossibly heavy bag of books from
the University store, I couldn’t help
wondering—how long until textbooks
go extinct? The University of Phoe-
nix has already done away with paper
textbooks. Instead, professors order the
needed number of “e-books” from a
ﬁrm and distribute them to students at a

much-reduced cost. Often a $250.00
chemistry text can be purchased for as
little as $35.00. At Meridian Intemation-
al College in Taguig City, administra-
tors make it even easier for students by
providing iPads for all, free of cost. At
the University of Texas at San Antonio,
iPads are on hire in the library with the
required reading pre-loaded. Although

It is the mission of THE

this kind of generosity may be a stretch
for even the ﬁnances of our school it led
me to wonder#what would be the ad-
vantage of Washington and Lee going
the e-book route?

First of all, the e-book route is the
paperless route. To be politically cor-
rect, our institution has to adhere to the
popular cries of “save the planet” and
“reduce, re-use, recycle.” While many
see little sense in the notion that drink-
ing coffee from a recycled paper cup
will somehow make up for the mounds
of carbon dioxide released into the at-
mosphere when we drive our cars every
day, it is comforting that we are “saving
the planet” with so
little motion.

and say, “Hey, I managed to make my
books only cost $150.00 this semester.
Does this mean I get to keep the extra
$500.00?!” He might just say yes. It
would be worth a try. The price of text-
books almost tripled between 1986 and
2004, and the last seven years have seen
no reduction. The typical American stu-
dent spends about a $1000.00 21 year on
books. And not all people have the op-
tion of simply “swiping home” this little
problem. For some students, the cost of
books can inhibit them from attending
college at all.

And even if it this is not a problem
for you, think what could be done with

the doors of all of its 399 stores. As digi-
tal books outstrip the traditional, I know
many of us will remember with fondness
(and not a little regret), our childhoods
ﬁlled with the old kind of books, the
“real” books. We might remember cud-
dling up next to our parents for picture
books before bed (remember Goodnight
Moon, Curious George, and Amelia Be-
delia?), or the ﬁrst time we were able to
read a book through on our own (skip-
ping all the big unpronounceable words,
of course). And then of course there was
the long wait and joyful celebration ev-
ery time a new Harry Potter arrived on
the shelves.

Then again, peo-
ple like what they

Being Superman
has never been so
easy. It is hard not
to love the sense of
well-being one gets
from deciding not to
print that PDF but
to read it online, or
choosing to take the
extra time to ﬁgure
out which of the many colorful trashcans
one’s plastic Coke bottle is supposed to
go in (I sometimes do this when I am
depressed—quite the mood-booster.)

I am not sure that our University
administrators get a mood-boost from
enforcing the policy of being environ-
mentally friendly, but it is certainly
taken seriously. D-hall has plastic to-go
containers, the library printers are often
set to print double-sided (much to the
chagrin of someone trying to print a pa-
per), and the lights routinely go off in
my hallway if I take more than the allot-
ted ﬁve seconds to reach my destination.
If our university does all this, shouldn’t
we do away with the great waste of pa-
per traditional textbooks represent? One
tree only makes about 200 books. That
is a lot of sad trees.

A second factor in favor of e-books
is the cost. Maybe I could go to my dad

Maybe I could go to my dad and say, “Hey, 1 man-
aged to make my books only cost $150 this semester.

Does this mean I get to keep the extra $500?! ”

$500.00 in extra change! I could totally
buy that new Coach bag I’ve been day-
dreaming about (Coach Classic Leather
Madison Satchel, in vermillion).

Speaking of bags, the introduction
of e-books would make it essential that
I get that bag. Without heavy pounds
of books to carry, the nature of the on-
campus item holder would be radically
changed. Away with the bulky backpack
and in with the cute carry-all, designed
to be just big enough to carry an iPad
and a few other essentials. In fact, I
could probably use any of the purses I
have in my closet. (But don’t tell my
dad! I really want that bag.)

Finally, e-books are simply the way
of the future. In July of 2010, Amazon
announced that for the ﬁrst time ever in
the past three months, its sale of e-books
was greater than its sale of hard-copy
books. In July of 2011, Borders closed

son can get used to
anything. So when
all of us now in col-
lege ﬁnally have kids
they will probably be
perfectly happy with
their e-readers and
iPads, watching Cu-
rious George jump
across the screen to the Man with the
Yellow Hat instead of the old page-tum
otherwise used to get him there.
Considering all these things on my
walk to my house on Thursday, and
arriving there drenched in sweat from
mental exertion and the weight of my
heavy book-load, was quite the trying
experience. My conclusion is that it is
alright for things to go extinct some-
times. If they are outdated, outmoded or
obsolete, they should go. To hold onto
them is to make oneself obsolete. Now
let’s just hope W&L comes to the same
conclusion soon, so we can hold onto

our new, shiny and bright Forbes #25 V

listing.

“friendly”

eye contact.

NOTE: Know the difference between
“friendly” and “creepy.” Friendly means
fewer than three seconds. Creepy means

more than ﬁve seconds.

3. Introduce yourself. Then pause
to let the other person do the same.

NOTE: You do not need to pay much
attention to the name the person says.
You’ll forget it by the time you cross the
quad back to your room, anyway.

4. Ask a question.

NOTE: Favorites include “What
dorm are you in?,” “Where are you
from?,” and of course, the W&L staple,
“Are you going out tonight?” Small talk
can stem easily from each answer given,
e.g. “Oh, Graham-Lees? That sucks—
no A/C.” Or, invariably, “Graham-Lees?
Awesome!” High ﬁving may ensue.

5. Say goodbye (or any of its

variations).

6. I Rinse and repeat.

NOTE: Of course, next time pick a
different person. Try at least to remem-
ber whether or not you’ve already in-
troduced yourself to someone. This will
save you from plodding through more
inane chatter than necessary.

As a ﬁrst-year, I’m wonderingAAre
any of my other classmates also tired of
having the same conversation again and
again? It’s like experiencing intermina-
ble déja vu. Especially when you have
the same conversation with the same
person you met just last Saturday, but
don’t actually remember.

Of course if you don’t introduce

yourself, then you won’t familiar-
ize yourself with anyone. And if I’ve
learned anything in my ﬁrst week, it’s
that living social is quite the priority at
W&L. The speaking tradition speaks for
itself (wink, wink, nudge, nudge).
Corny jokes aside, I really do feel a
bit washed out of my desire to repeat the
standard dialogue.’ Each of us is play-
ing a tired role, using a tired script, and
ignoring the fact that perhaps meeting
so many people, so quickly is actually
ineffectual. I don’t remember half the
people ‘I’ve met, especially as I haven’t
talked to them since our hasty introduc-
tions. But what can be done? It seems
as if going through the motions is man-

dated by the status of “new student,” or
“ﬁrst-year.”

Either way, I admit my premature so-
cial ennui. I just hope it isn’t so heavy
that it cannot be lifted or shattered by
any single surprise in conversation.
And, of course, I do retain vast stores
of hope for the coming days of the year
when our cordial urges will be satisﬁed
(for the most part). Eventually, we will
be familiar enough with our surround-
ings to do social improv., that is, to be
ourselves.

Stereotyping W&L ﬁrst-years

Former editor Stockton Bullitt lists the types of students he suspects students will recognize in the incoming class

I
thought
that se-
nior year
of college
would be
similar to
senior year
of high
school. All
I would
have to do
is wax po-
etic about
every
meaningless last I ever did, and drench
my prose in nostalgic phrases with
meaningless inside jokes. Throwing in
an extra “Do less” or “Move it, football
head” would be enough to prove that, as
a senior, I am properly keeping an eye
on the past while moving way too fast
towards graduation and the future.

However, senior year hasn’t really
worked out this way so far. Instead, I
ﬁnd myself doing two things I usually
chide others for doing. I talk way too
much about getting old, and I give way
too much patronizing advice to fresh-
men at parties. I hate these two aspects
about myself because 22 is not terribly
old, and my advice in the past has guar-
anteed Louisville over Moorehead State
and Germany winning the World Cup.

So even though I’m right about most
things (e.g. the J-School and everything
I’m writing in this article), please do not
let me get to Yoda levels of patronizing
advice. It gets boring after a while.

With that said, every freshmen class
is unique in its own way, but, c’mon, this
is Washington and Lee, where unique
has been a relative term for over 250
years. So, here are some stereotypes that
will probably be in the freshman class
this year. I’d add more of an introduc-
tion, but I might throw my back out in
my old, decrepit age.

The Tyler the Creator kid

This is the spot reserved for the to-
ken crazy freshmen. Most upperclass-
men, especially sophomores, are eager
to challenge any over-aggressive fresh-
men during the beginning of the year.
Usually all these upperclassmen have to
do is find the blond freshman with gel
in his hair surrounded by all the cute
freshmen girls and challenge his author-
ity in public. You’ve seen this plotline
on “Planet Earth” hundreds of times,
and 99 percent of the time, the freshman
backs down and sulks in the comer.

However, the Tyler the Creator kid is
never even approached by upperclass-
men because he is freaking crazy. There
may be plenty ofolder guys complaining
about his presence, but they will never
do it to his face. The Tyler the Creator
kid does not have to prove that he is
crazy like Arnold did in that episode of
“Hey Arnold.” Rather, It’s something in
his eyes. Guys will not mess with him
no matter what he does to them.

You are probably wondering why he
is named the Tyler the Creator kid. Well,
Tyler the Creator is the epitome of this
persona. He recently won MTV’s Best
New Artist Award, but I have a feeling
you don’t know who he is, and if you
are older than 25, you deﬁnitely do not
want to know who he is. Watch the mu-
sic video for his top single “Yonkers,”
and you will either characterize him as
crazy good or crazy evil; it all depends
on your music tastes.

Whether you like him or not, Tyler
the Creator is on top of his game now.
He is the Kevin Durant of the hip hop
genre. His album “Goblin” was released
right around the time the Thunder made
it to the Western Finals, and his summer
releases have coincided perfectly with
KD’s Rucker Park and other exhibi-

tion masterpieces. Tyler’s R&B buddy,
Frank Ocean, is looking very similar to
Russell Westbrook after being featured
on three songs in Jay-Z and Kanye’s
“Watch the Throne.” And his little cous-
in, Earl Sweatshirt, bears a striking re-
semblance to James Harden. It all ﬁts!

Long-Distance Relationship kid

Enough movies have been made
about this for me not to have to go into
great detail, so instead l’ll give some
patronizing advice. As this kid’s friend,
it’s not your job to keep the relation-
ship going or break it up. Like Miley
Cyrus’ career, the relationship will end,
and it will end quickly. Even President
Ruscio knows about the Turkey Drop.
As the friend, your job is to make sure
that when your friend goes public, his
IPO price is adequately high. Don’t let
him screw up his single life by apply-
ing early decision to his safety school.
You also have to make sure that he isn’t
just applying to Ivies because he thinks
that hot girls will like him just because
he was nice to his high school girlfriend.
Overall, just be careful because these
new commodities are especially volatile
in the market.

Fifteen Pounds Girl

I’m not going to go into much detail
because anywhere I go with this will
get me into trouble, so here’s a quick
description: every freshman class has
one girl who gets the freshman ﬁfteen
and one girl who drops the freshman ﬁf-
teen. Regardless of what happens, there
will be some passive-aggressive con-
versations about it in her friend group.
If she added ﬁfteen pounds, she will
vehemently avoid and dismiss any con-
versation topic about weight. If she lost
ﬁfteen pounds, she will leave hanging
sentences just so you can compliment
her on her looks.

The worst part of these situations is
how much needless worrying and fo-
cus is dedicated to these ﬁfteen pounds.
Your weight is kind of like your pet:
nobody else cares about the intricacies
of maintaining it. No one minds a single
dog story, but everyone hates the person
who never stops talking about his or her
cats. It’s the same way with weight. If
you start saying the word calories more
than ﬁve times a day, people are going to
start hating you, and that’s a fact.

Will Ferrell kid

Just like most Will Ferrell movies, '

you probably don’t like this kid right
now. His jokes aren’t funny, and there
seems to be something a little off about
him. By October, you might be telling
your friends that this kid has all the
signs of a GDI. Look, I had the same
feeling when I ﬁrst saw “Anchorman” or
even “Land of the Lost.” At ﬁrst glance,
none of Will Ferrell’s movies are that
great. But just like “Grandma’s Boy”
and “Family Guy,” Will Ferrell’s mov-
ies get exponentially better with each re-
peat showing. You hear the same dumb
jokes, and suddenly Veronica Mantooth
is funny as hell. It’s the same way with
this kid. It’ll start with his freshman
friends swearing by him. It will prob-
ably take you a while to warm up to
this kid, the same way that it took you
a while to warm up to the idea of Will
Ferrell befriending a T-Rex, but I prom-
ise you it will happen. And by May, you
will swear by this kid and be quoting his
jokes religiously. Know that the next
time you’re glaring maliciously at that
dumbass freshman with his dumbass
grin standing nonchalantly at Windfall.

Judgy friend

No matter what your "interests are or
how many friends you have, there will
be one of these kids for every group of
friends in the freshmen class. This is the
kid that will raise his or her eyebrows
condescendingly when you whip_ out a

_ stupid reasoning, just

handle or decide to go home with some-
one. This is the kid that quietly smirks
when you mention you might be inter-
ested in checking out the Hillel house.
He or she is the friend dedicated to lim-
iting your fun and adventure this year.
Just know two things: 1) these kids get
shit on all four years for being downers
and 2) if you aren’t doing a couple of
new things your freshmen year, whatev-
er they are, then you are deﬁnitely doing
something wrong. Just look at Jay-Z.

Before this summer, when was the
last time you saw Jay-Z smile? No, not
on the “Hard Knock Life” video, that
was a smirk at best. He’s been so suc-
cessful with the corporate, serious busi-
nessman rapper image that he hasn’t had
to exert himself or even play around in
the last decade. But just look at him in
the “Otis” video, and you’ll see a grin-
ning adolescent who never imagined
that a Maybach could look like the Bat-
mobile. His carefree attitude on that
video changed the- entire “Watch the
Throne” album for me. The album was
characterized as a

pate in all that popularity stuff because
she is above all of that. Just notice where
she is during sorority meetings and how
she acts at Windfall after a couple of
drinks. Suddenly the girl who bakes her
own bread and lectures you about what
“real art” means is twirling her hair
looking deep into the eyes of some Phi
Delt. Plus, she’ll tell you that The Girl
with The Dragon Tattoo is a trashy read
that is not worth her time.

And that is NOT the case. The Girl
with the Dragon Tattoo is easily the best

beach read novel of the past decade and I

will own the box oﬁice when the movie
hits theaters during Christmas. l’ve
spent more time defending this series
than I have defending “Entourage” to
non-adolescent males, and that’s saying
something. The Girl with the Dragon
Tattoo series is so far above The Da Vin-
ci Code, it’s a crime to compare them.
The Da Vinci Code is just another reason
why English teachers from Exeter have
needlessly high opinions of themselves
and what they do.

Phase kid

This kid will spend his entire college
career ﬁnding that one thing he wants
to do for the rest of his life. The only
problem is that he will change his mind
every couple of months. The key with
this kid is to make sure he or she has
a genuine interest in the new calling.
See, about half of the phase kids just go
through different phases of interests be-
cause they are searching for something
they feel passionate about. That’s ﬁne.
But the other half make their decisions
based solely on whether other people
think what they’re doing is cool. There’s
no deﬁnitive way to know if your phase
kid friend is a leader or a follower, but
know that if he or she is in the Dub-
step Phase, SEC Football Coach Phase,
ROTC Phase or Drug Phase, you should
be especially vigilant.

By Colleen Moore

Incoming ﬁrst-years gave this year’s
Volunteer Venture the most positive re-
views yet, said Jenny Davidson, Student
Service Learning Coordinator. Ofthe 99
participants, 80 percent said they plan to
volunteer in Lexington and on campus.

The one-week service learning pro-
gram took place in Roanoke, Lexington,
Washington, Greensboro, Charleston
and Richmond, the most recently creat-
ed trip. The program aimed to introduce
ﬁrst-years to each other, to poverty is-
sues and to upperclassmen who can help
them become involved on campus and
in the Rockbridge area.

“The Volunteer Venture trip was
probably the best possible way I could
have picked to start my time at Wash-
ington and Lee,” said one participant.

“It was an incredible experience that al-
lowed me to help others while getting to
know classmates and upperclassmen.”

After choosing between the two pre-
orientation options of Volunteer Venture
and Appalachian Adventure, the future
W&L students picked which service
trip they wanted. Then they arrived one
week before regular move-in day and set
off for their particular city.

Thirty-three student leaders guided
the ﬁrst-years through the week. These
leaders had to undergo an interview pro-

cess and Poverty 101 before leading a'

trip. The Student Service Learning team
aimed for a diverse group with experi-
ence in volunteering and a strong in-
volvement in campus activities.
Leaders’ two-day training included

a talk from Dr. Horton, the director of
health and counseling service, to in-
form them about any medical issues that
might have arisen during the trip. _

Shiri Yadlin, the student coordinator,
played a huge role in the organization of
Volunteer Venture. As a ﬁrst-year, she
went on the D.C. Volunteer Venture trip
with similar goals ofmeeting people and

getting acquainted with W&L.

Having volunteered in high school,
she wanted to get involved on campus
and with the Shepherd Poverty pro-
gram. Her sophomore year, she led the
Lexington trip, which help to introduce
ﬁrst-years to not only W&L but also the
surrounding area.

“It encourages ﬁrst-years to get out-
side campus and get involved in the

nts to bond

community to places where nobody
typically goes,” said Yadlin.

As ajunior, Yadlin worked with Vol-
unteer Venture by creating and coordi-
nating the Richmond trip. As Student

Coordinator her senior year, Yadlin led s

the orientation for the trip leaders and

visited each site. ‘‘I got to see all the ,

trips in action,” she said.

Students interested in volunteering

on campus‘ can attend Nabors Service
Day, which places students at different
agencies where they can continue to vol-
unteer if they choose.

“If you can ﬁnd a place or an activ-
ity that you’re passionate about, it’s not
a burden. You will actively keep going
back to it,” said Yadlin.

F irst-years and trip leaders survive ﬁve days roughin ’it on the Appalachian Trail

By Paige Gance
ARTS & LIFE EDITOR

After ﬁve days ofbackpacking along
the Appalachian Trail, all 108 ﬁrst-years
and 36 trip leaders made it back to cam-
pus safely. This is the largest group ever
to go on the Appalachian Adventure pre-
orientation trip, now in its 16th year.

James Dick, Outing Club director,
said there are typically eight to nine
groups, but this year 12 groups hiked
sections of the trail from Mountain
Lake, Va. to Shenandoah National Park,
covering anywhere from 25 to 35 miles
total.

“We want people to truly meet a
small group of classmates, get to know
them, be themselves, in a non-forced
setting,” said Dick. “its a great way to
enter W&L.”

Fishing and rock climbing used to be
offered as pre-orientation trips, but Dick

said they moved to only backpacking
because the groups seem to form tighter
bonds.

Groups consist of three trip leaders
and nine ﬁrst-years all working together
to cook, set up tarps, start campﬁres and
carry everything the group needs on
their backs.

Trips ranged from moderate to chal-
lenging, based on total miles and eleva-
tion changes. Some trips had abundant
water sources, but others needed to car-
ry multiple 10-liter water bags to hold
them over until the next potential water
source.

Many participants were able to expe-
rience some of Virginia’s natural won-
ders for the ﬁrst time, like Devil’s Mar-
bleyard, Tinker Cliffs, McAfee’s Knob
and Dragon’s Tooth. The Outing Club

also organizes day trips to hiking desti-
nations like these during the school year.

The weather for the trips was gener-
ally in the campers’ favor, with only one
afternoon thunderstorm causing trouble
for a group caught on a high ridge.

An’ ongoing criminal investigation
also caused a fright for a few groups
camped near the James River, with one
group choosing to get picked up the
night before their scheduled departure.
Several forest rangers and law enforce-
ment ofﬁcers were in the area and spoke
to at least two groups.

They said their investigation con-
cemed the body of a hiker found a few
weeks prior on the trail, but assured one
group that they were “as safe as any-
where else on the trail.”

Beside the group that evacuated,

only one other person was picked up
early due to a cut that made carrying a
backpack painful.

“Overall though, it went well,” said
head sherpa Zach Zoller. He said the
work he and fellow head sherpa Ali
Pedersen put into the trips was akin to a
part-time summerjob.

Six sherpas coordinated the behind
the scenes aspect ofthe trips, like plan-
ning new routes, ordering hundreds of '
pounds of food, and communicating
with the incoming students via e-mail
over the summer.

Next year, Zoller said there may be
as many as four head sherpas as Appala-
chian Adventure gains more trip leaders
and participants.

Those interested in leading a trip

. next year need to take PE 180: Wilder-

ness Leadership in the winter. Leaders
also receive additional’ training in the
week before the trip, which includes
Wilderness First Aid certiﬁcation.

Next year, James said leaders will re-
ceive the advanced wilderness certiﬁca-
tion. Training will once again take place
at Camp Blue Ridge. Leaders went there
for the ﬁrst time this year because the
university had sold Skylark Farm, the
former training spot.

Senior Tal Jacobs, who has now lead
three trips and participated as a ﬁrst-
year, said leading pre-orientation trips
has been “one of the deﬁning elements
of my W&L career, and helped me ﬁnd
a group ofcool, interesting people in the
Outing Club.”

ootball starts season 2-0

After last year’s record-setting season, the
Washington and Lee football is off to a hot
start with an undefeated 2-0 record, boosted
by a comfortable 31-14 win over Sewanee in
Lexington on Saturday.

The win marked the Generals seventh
straight win over the Tigers and their ninth
straight regular season victory, a streak that
extends into last season.

W&L’s offense overcame its struggles
from the week before as senior quarterback
Charlie Westfal threw for two touchdowns
and ran for another to help the team roll up
414 yards, compared to the previous weeks
228 yards.

The Generals scored ﬁrst whenjunior run-
ning back Sasha Vandalov took a 16-yard run
into the endzone, topping off a 10-play drive
that covered 73 yards.

The lead grew with a 27-yard touchdown
pass ﬁ‘om Westfal to senior wide receiver
Cody Smith on a gutsy 4th and 8 play with
just over four minutes left before the half,
putting W&L up by 14.

Senior placekicker Peter Alston added that

lead with a 35-yard ﬁeld goal, and a dominant"

defense kept the Tigers scoreless for the ﬁrst
half, giving the Generals a comfortable 17-0
advantage at the break.

Sewanee came out strong in the third quar-
ter, ﬁnding the end on its ﬁrst possession less
than ﬁve minutes into the second half. A fake
punt on 4th and 1 1 extended the Tigers’ drive
and helped them get on the board.

W&L responded with back-to-back scores,
the ﬁrst a 14-yard run by Westfal and the sec-
ond a 16-yard pass from Westfal to sophomore

end Alex Evans, to go Lip 31-7 with just over
seven minutes of playing time remaining.

The Tigers came up with a late score in
the ﬁnal minute to help close the margin of
victory.

The Generals’ defense held Sewanee to
only 256 yards for the day. Senior defensive
back Jake Pelton led the team with 11 tack-
les, nine of which were solo, and recovered a
fumble, whilejunior linebacker Stephen Peck
recorded a sack and seven tackles.

A week earlier, W&L started the season
with a 24-10 win over Franklin & Marshall
a week earlier, snapping a three-game losing
streak to the Diplomats.

A dominantdefense made up for early of-
fensive struggles as the team forced ﬁve tum-
overs and came up with ﬁve sacks while hold-
ing F&M to only 14 rushing yards, though the
Generals were outgained on the day 316 to
228. ‘

After a scoreless ﬁrst quarter, W&L found
the end zone ﬁrst 44 seconds into the second
quarter when Westfal connected with Evans
for a 10-yard touchdown pass to go up by
seven.

 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
  

The Diplomats responded with a 25-yard
ﬁeld goal on their ensuing drive and threat-
ened to score again on their next drive as they
got to the W&L 11-yard line. Senior line-
backer Rob Look was able to preserve the
Generals’ lead by intercepting a pass on the
9-yardline.

On their third drive, F&M again got within
scoring distance ofthe end zone but missed a
31-yard ﬁeld goal as the clock ran out ‘at the
end of the half, allowing the Generals to go
into the break with a 7-3 lead.

W&L put three more points on the board
with a ﬁeld goal at the end ofthe third quarter,
and then added a touchdown by junior run-
ning back Brett Murray to go up 17-3 with
10:29 left to play.

Three minutes later, the Diplomats added
a touchdown of their own, but the Generals
put away threats of an upset by scoring once
again, this time a six-yard run by Westfal, to
secure the win with less than four minutes left
to play.

The team will head to Centre College on
Saturday for a 7:30 p.m. contest, but will be
back in Lexington the week after to take on
Alma.

Volleyball kicking ace

The Generals are 0/?" to a 8-0 Start and have dropped only two of their 26 sets

By Angela Williams
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee volleyball team
is off to an undefeated start highlighted by
winning their own tournament last weekend
for the third time in four years.

The Generals breezed through the W&L
tournament, dropping only one set out of
their four games.

in the opening match Friday afternoon,
W&L overcame Averett University to win
3-0. Averett challenged in the ﬁrst set before
falling 26-24. The Generals took off in the
next two sets, posting wins of25-16 and 25-
1 1.

Sophomore hitters Allison Rouse and
M.A. Boles dominated the nets, recording 11
and seven kills, respectively. Rouse also add-
ed seven digs while Boles served three aces.

W&L took on Elizabethtown College later
the same day with similar results.

Boles lead the team with 15 kills in the 3-0

sweep, taking down the Blue Jays with scores

of 25-16, 25-16 and 25-11. Senior blocker
Lindsey Dee managed eight kills out of only
10 swings.

Junior libero Cameron Hill came up with
14 digs, which gave her 1,127 career digs and
moved her into sixth place all-time at W&L.
Hill also recorded 15 digs against Averett.

In addition to their killing and digging tal-
ents, the Generals aced 16 serves. Sophomore
setter Meghan Meleski, ﬁrst-year defensive
specialist Kelly McManus and senior defen-
sive specialist Megan Toinlinson each con-
tributed four aces.

Day two staited against Southern Vir-
ginia University and led to the Generals’ one
dropped set. After easily taking the ﬁrst set
25-16, W&L slipped in the second to lose 17-
25. The team quickly recovered to ﬁnish the
game with 25-12 and 25-13 victories.

Meleski set a personal career-liigh with 50

assists, while Boles again led the team with

19 kills. She was far from the only offensive
power, as Dee contributed 1 1 kills andjunior
hitter Taylor Maxey added nine more.

For the ﬁnal match of the tournament,
W&L took down Gettysburg 3-0, winning
the sets 25-18, 25-18, 25-21 to take home its
eighth championship in this tournament.

Boles was dominate again, notching 20
kills and nine digs, and Rouse put in a strong
game both offensively and defensively, re-
cording 13 kills and six digs.

W&L’s eight straight wins mark their best
start to a season since 2008.

The team has talent and contributors at
every position, suggesting that the season’s
early success is just a taste of what the Gener-
als can accomplish.

The Generals will travel to Guilford on
Tuesday, but will be back on the courts in
Lexington on Friday to take on Hollins at 5
p.m.
