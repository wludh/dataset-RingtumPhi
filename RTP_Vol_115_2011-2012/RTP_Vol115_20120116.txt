Occupy W&L: Fighting debt

Members of the so-called“0ccupy” generation ﬁnds creative ways to combat lingering student loan debt

By Mickey Gorman
STA F F WRITE R

Far from Zuccotti Park, in the back
of Washington and Lee’s performing arts
center, Tony Lawrence is ﬁghting back
against the one percent in his own way.

The scene shop in W&L’s Lenfest
Center for the Arts is in, shambles. The
destruction is the result of countless
hours of carefully disassembling the
scenery from recent plays. Lawrence,
the theater’s technical director, is re-
sponsible for building and taking down’
the set from each play. For the sake of
cost efficiency he must deconstruct the
scenery down to the last two-by-four so
the materials canbe reused.

. But after everyone else has left the
shop, Lawrence pushes all unﬁnished
projects and debris to the side and begins
work on his second job.

In an effort to pay off his student
loans, the theater’s technical director
uses his.skill as a carpenter to craft fra-
ternity paddles with the W&L trident to
sell to students in Greek organizations.

The 29-year-old Lawrence ﬁnds him-
self in what some people are now calling
the Occupy generation. Like many of his
peers, Lawrence is trying to make ends
meet while dealing with the weight of
student loans on his shoulders — $70,000
in loans, that is.

Despite reports in June from Colleg-
eGrad.com that hiring for entry leveljobs
increased 22 percent from last year, the
Occupy Movement spread like wildﬁre
to college campuses. Students express
concern about rising tuition costs, stu-
dent loan debt, and weak job prospects.

Students at schools like Harvard Univer-
sity and University of California, Berke-
ley, have tied these problems directly to
the Occupy Wall Street movement.

However, more relief seems to be on
the horizon. Interest rates are dropping
to eye-opening lows. Students may see
rates as low as 3.4 percent, Liz Weston
reported on MSN Money.

“I am going to reﬁnance my loans be-
cause interest rates are crazy [low] these
days,” Lawrence said.

This has been part of Lawrence’s pro-
active approach to overcoming the “one
percent”: trying to save a buck and make
a buck wherever possible. As far as the
rest of the occupiers, Lawrence tries to
-be sympathetic.

“I understand their plight,” he said,

“but you can’t expect to get a job if you
went to college for something useless...
like underwater basket weaving.”

In its newest survey CollegeGrad.
com, which bills itself “The #1 Entry
Level Job Site,”, reported that the col-
lege majors drawing the most entry level
job offers were business administration,
engineering, and marketing. Lawrence
majored in theater and went to graduate
school to receive a degree in theater with
an emphasis on technical direction.

With such a speciﬁc skill set acquired
through his unique education path, Law-
rence says that he has never worried
about job security. '

“People are always going to want
stuff,” Lawrence said. _

His newest example of “stuff” to

make and ‘sell are customized, hand
crafted fraternity paddles. He has not
determined a price for each paddle yet,
but is convinced he can beat the “inﬂat-
ed” prices of the W&L bookstore. The
bookstore, a popular outlet for fraternity
paddles, sells paddles for $15 in the win-
ter term.

Lawrence plans to go door to door
at fraternity houses giving his best sales
pitch. Every paddle is one step closer to
having his loans repaid.

“It is nothing to retire on, but any-
thing to help lighten the load of all that
debt,” Lawrence said.

ITS responds to student needs

New smart phone access maybe added after summer improvements to wireless networks and the stable

By Neil Haggerty
STAFF WRITER

Information Technology Services is
using the results of a May 2011 survey
to improve technology at Washington
and Lee.

According to the 444 survey respons-
es to the ITS survey, the main issues that
students at W&L felt needed to be ad-
dressed were “wireless network capac-
ity, wireless network coverage, and reli-
able and available University network.”

In response to these complaints ITS
informed students that they added wire-
less coverage to the archaeology labora-
tory, the Alpha Delta Pi sorority house

vice was also enhanced in the Intema-

During Thanksgiving break, ITS
made more improvements. The “entire
wireless system” received an upgrade,
according to a recent e-mail sent to all
students. That upgrade, ITS reported, has
helped ease “continuity in service when
students are moving between buildings.”

been upgraded, according to the ITS
report. This includes the automatic con-
nection of network computers to printer,
new software, and training at the Smart
Zone for students who wish to learn how
to access local storage.

“The stable has been a huge blessing.
I no longer have to run around campus
to a desktop computer to access docu-
merits,” senior Ben Ersing said.

Another improvement that ITS made
in the classroom is the implementation
of Tegrity, a service that allows protes-
sors to record their classes.

 

According to the ITS response to
students, “The tool is now available in
about 25 percent of undergraduate class-
rooms, but many faculty members have
not embraced the tool.”

Some students, like Ersing, wish that
program was utilized more.

“I would love to be able to listen to
recordings of classes,” Ersing said, cit-
ing the difﬁculty of taking notes in cer-
tain classes that move at a very fast pace.
He said has not seen Tegrity used in any
ofhis classes in the Williams School.

Future improvements are also com-

ing. According to ITS, students may
soon be able to access school informa-
tion with smart phones.

‘ According to the e-mail, “ITS is test-
ing tools that would provide improved
access from smartphones to grades,
course listings and other University
data.”

Analyzing gender relations

After spending a semester abroad Francesca Wilson sheds light on gender relations ’ issues on W&L ’s campus

' In mid-
, December I
I returned to my
hometown of
San Francisco
after a fantas-
tic semester
in Madrid. I
had originally
intended to
spend the win-
ter studying in
London. How-
ever, after just
a few weeks at
home and suf-
ﬁcient time to catch up with my Wash-
ington and Lee friends, I realized that I
couldn’t bear another semester sans Lex.
Some urgent phone calls were made dur-
ing the first week in January but luckily
I arrived in Virginia just in time to start
the semester, which as you all know, co-
incides with sorority and fraternity rush.
I have to say that I grossly underes-
timated how overwhelmed I would feel

by my sorority’s recruitment efforts. The
exuberance of the singing, dancing and
cheering that deﬁnes rush week could
not have clashed more awkwardly with
the tranquility of my extra-curricular-
free study abroad experience. Needless
to say,Il spent the last week dazed and
confused in some form of reverse culture
shock that has only just begun to wear
off.

Throughout my week of re-integra-
tion I began to notice the stark gender
divide that exists within our community.
I think that before my sojourn on the Eu-
ropean continent I had become de-sensi-
tized to the issues of gender relations on
W&L’s campus. I wasn’t disturbed by the
fact that my only interactions with males
occurred in the classroom or on Wind-
fall. Of course I realized that our school
exhibits peculiar dealings between males
and females, but I had become so inte-
grated into the W&L social network that
I wasn’t bothered by such apparent mu-
tual objectiﬁcation of the sexes.

Nevertheless, after returning to

school, I am thoroughly perturbed by
the nature of gender relations at W&L.
I realize that my previous statement may
appear a bit dramatic and is likely large-
ly inﬂuenced by re-entering our school

By the end of the week the entire student
body is grouchy, fatigued, behind on
homework and desperate to drink. Satur-
day night eventually rolls around and the
males and females of Washington and

Needless to say vomit, Health Center trips, the oc-

casional ER bound collegiate, Plan B popping and

moral hangovers deﬁne Tear Night and certainly

account for an eventful start to the semester

 

during a particularly divided week. That
said, the stressful schedule of rush is cer-
tainly not conducive to a gender healthy
start to the semester. Freshman women
stress about placement, division of friend
groups and outﬁt choices, while boys are
invited to sumptuous dinners, receive
their bids (usually mid-week) and are re-
warded with copious amounts of alcohol.

Lee stagger onto Windfall and reconnect
while (sometimes anonymously) locking
lips and jamming to Ike and Tina. We all
know that the Dance Floor Makeout is
the hallmark of Tear Night.

Needless to say vomit, Health Center
trips, the occasional ER bound colle-
giate, Plan B popping and moral hang-
overs deﬁne Tear Night and certainly

account for an eventful start to the se-
mester. As Sunday evening approaches
the student body at long last crawls out
of bed, sidles into the library and delib-
erately avoids eye contact thus perpetu-
ating a negative environment of gender
relations on our campus.

My goal with this column is to ex-
plore fraternity and sorority centric
atmosphere of W&L and the ways in
which it specifically perpetuates issues
of gender relations within the univer-
sity. I am by no means pretending that
I have not at many points enabled this
particular gender divide. However, af-
ter leaving for a semester I believe I am
able to somewhat objectively critique the
gender dynamic on our campus. Galva-
nized and somewhat shocked by what
I observed last night, I hope to bring a
fresh and ﬁghting perspective to the con-
tinuous problem of mutual objectiﬁca-
tion between the sexes.

From free beer to slavery: four stages of brotherhood

Opinions Editor Campbell Burr describes how the Greek system controls the attitudes and actions

. . W At a school
I with the highest
percentage of
students who go
Greek, it is no
surprise that rush
and pledgeship
affect the mind-
sets and attitudes
of the students,
especially the
boys. After a lot
of observation

  
   

3‘, Campbell gun. and analysis,
OPINIONS Eniron 1 have broken
freshman year

into four phases based on the way boys
behave. This piece is not only meant to
inform you of the ways in which college
boys change overtime, but also to let you
know how you should expect to interact
with the boys in each stage.

So without further ado, I present
“The Four Stages of the Freshman Boy.”

Stage 1: Wow, Hot Girls and Free Beer

Stage 1 consists of the first two weeks
of school, when freshman boys are invit-
ed to all parties, surrounded by cute girls,

and given as much free alcohol as they
want. They have just been dropped off at
school and had their rooms decorated by
their mommies, who sent them with ex-
tra blankets, in case they get cold, and a
nightlight, in case they need to go to the
bathroom in the middle of the night. For
some, this may be their first time away
from their moms, and for others, their
ﬁrst experience with alcohol, and boy
do they think drinking is cool. Soon the
picture of John holding his baby cousin
will be replaced by a poster of two girls
making out (yes, they do sell this in the
school store).

If you walk through D-hall, you may
overhear some boys spitting the Alco-
holEdu terms they’ve been aching to use
all summer. “Dang it dude, I engaged in
some high-risk drinking last night and
casually browned out. Calculated that I
had 6 ounces of tequila in an hour. If that
isn’t binge drinking than I don’t know
what is.” These boys will make trip after
trip to reﬁll their cups with blue Pow-
erade in D-hall, just to show their class-
mates that they go hard.

This is also the period when the
health center has more overnight visitors

Every freshman boy gets a little bit
cocky as this stage progresses, but I
guess anyone would if a group of up-
perclassmen were worshipping him and

As much as we like to laugh at
these boys, we can’t. Whether you went
through this stage in 8th grade, llth
grade, or the ﬁrst week of college, you
went through this stage. Independence is
cool and so is free alcohol—some just
enjoy it later than others.

Stage 2: “Time isn’t wasted when
you’re getting wasted”

Stage 2 consists of the rest of ﬁrst se-
mester, when boys are trying to win the
respect of upperclassmen boys. They’lI
talk to them about sports, and the num-
ber of girls they’ve hooked up with at
school. All I can say is remember the
Rule of Three.

In this stage, boys are invited on rush
trips. These may consist of getting bel-
ligerently drunk, getting on a bus, going
to an Italian restaurant, passing out in
a restaurant booth, getting back on the
bus, throwing up, and passing Out again.
Strippers may also appear at events,
making some boys feel more guilt than
excitement over what they are witness-
ing. Fraternity informal rush consists of
anything that would be strictly forbidden

attending to his every need. The boys en-
joy “playing pong” after class on Fridays
and going back to fraternity houses to
hang out “late night.” They are also in-
vited to fraternity formals, always bring-
ing hot dates to impress the brothers.

Tear Night is their ﬁnal night of free-
dom and last chance to do outrageous
stuff to impress Older brothers and get
out of some pledgeship duties. If a fresh-
man boy says something along the lines
of, “I like kinda saw her bra,” he may
be granted an ‘extra hour of freedom that
week.

Stage 3: Eight Weeks of Slavery

The morning after Tear Night begins
the longest eight weeks of a freshman
boy’s year. They must attend to their re-
sponsibilities in school, as well as their
big brothers’ every need.

Pledgeship is also a weird period for
freshman girls. D-hall clears out, the ﬁrst
and second floors of Graham-Lees feel
vacant, and whenever you see a male
classmate, he looks tired and a little bit
miserable. You know it’s bad when your
male classmates have been wearing the

The most “tear”riﬁc night of the

same shirt for a week and look like they
have lost twenty pounds because they
“can’t ﬁnd time to eat.” Wish I had that
scheduling problem. Besides offering re-
assuring smiles and occasional laundry
service, there is little girls can do.

Even though pledgeship seems mis-
erable, it accomplishes what it is meant
to accomplish. Pledge brothers become
absurdly close, closer than they could
become singing songs and baking cook-
ies together. By the end of pledgeship,
they are so in love with each other that
some boys contemplate why they needed
girls around in the ﬁrst place.

Stage 4: The Ego Boost

The same poor souls who wore dirty
clothes for eight weeks, failed tests, and
were deprived of sleep and food have
made a comeback. If you thought your
male classmates were cocky before
pledgeship, wait until you see them af-
ter. They are enjoying the hugest ego
boost of their lives, and have become a
different breed than the shy little fresh-
men their mommies dropped off at the
beginning of the year.

Topics of conversation with this new
breed: how awesome they are; how they
cannot wait to get their hands on the in-
coming group of “biddies” in the fall;
how nothing could compare to what
they have been through. They have been
through a lot and deserve our respect,
but beware that they may be a bit big-
headed.

Freshman year is ﬁ.1ll of changes for
boys. SO ifyou see a ﬁrst year who is un-
shaven and appears a bit stressed, don’t
feel too son'y for him. In eight weeks,
he’ll be going 70 mph down Washington
Street, blasting Widespread Panic and
thinking he’s the man.

Rooney and Zuroski describe Tear Night, an annual holiday at W&L

   

By “Bella Zumslii and
Bridget Rooney
C D L U M N15 TS

Congratulations — if
you’re reading this, you
survived Tear Night 2012!
(Hopefully you didn’t end
up in the health center/
hospital, but if you did —
there’s always next year!)
The following is a (hypo-
thetical) walkthrough of a
typical tear night:

If you’re a girl, you
start out with a nice car-
bo-loaded dinner at the
sorority house to prepare
yourself for the night (the
chefs know what’s up).
Next, you head to an off-
campus house for some
nice pledge class... bond-
ing. After a few hours of
dancing to “Rack City”
over and over (and over),
you ﬁnd yourself being
herded by your sober sis-
ters into the sorority ve-
hicles (typically SUV’s
covered in Greek letters
and exclamation points
— saooooo cute and spir-
ited!) to a fraternity house
to officially begin Tear
Night festivities. There,
you might ﬁnd yourself
in a number of situa-
tions, including bonding
with your new sisters on
the dance floor (oh-em-

gee! I I I) or “bonding” with
new fraternity pledges on
the dance floor. From
there, anything goes.
From around 10-12,
activities may include
romping around from
fratemity house to fra-
ternity house until those
Greek letter-clad SUV’s
come back to herd you
to the midnight breakfast
(There’s bacon! Presi-
dent Ruscio will be there!
You’ll love it I swear).
Naturally, you hear the
word “bacon” and run to
the car. At the midnight
breakfast, you will ﬁnd
yourself entranced by the
buffet of eggs, bacon, bis-
cuits, etc. However, you
may be among the few
who approach President
Ruscio angrily complain-
ing about the lack of pan-
cakes (common miscon-

ception about the name of
the event — it’s Midnight
Breakfast, not Pancake
Breakfast, people).

After the breakfast,
you have it dead set in
your mind that you are
making it to Windfall this
year. But when you get
there, the band is already
on its last song (but hey,
you made it!). So you
round up your freshmen
and bring them back to
the house to introduce
them to thejnirvana of
Frank Parsons Way — the
snack table. You might
walk around the halls
singing “Rack City” to
yourself for a while more
(you just can’t escape
that song), then hash out
the night and retreat into
snuggle mode, curling up
on afuton to fall into a
sweet Tear Night slumber.

The next morning, you
wake up and run around
the house (still in your
Tear Night ensemble),
rounding everyone up and
hashing out the night in or-
der to ﬁnd out who scored
the best DF M . Hypotheti-
cally, you get a freshman
to swipe you into D-Hall
for brunch (it’s no lon-
ger a rush violation!) and
watch the poor freshman
boys march off to the ﬁrst
day of a fabulous 8 weeks.

Although it’s sad that
the night that deserves to
be recognized as a nation-
al holiday is over, we’ll
always have the memories
(at least some of us will).
Only 365 days until the
next Tear Night!

  Outing Club Welcomes students back

Students snow-tube, hike, zipline and ice skate to celebrate the beginning of a new term and to escape the stress of rush

By Travis Wakeman
STA F F w RITE R

Non-Greek students and those need-
ing to escape the stress of rush week
could zip-line, hike under a full moon,
and go snow tubing and ice-skating as
part of the Outing Club’s “Welcome
Back Week.”

Starting with a full-moon hike on
Tuesday, a rollout rappel on Friday and
snow tubing and ice skating over the
weekend, the Outing Club offered ample
opportunities to release the stress that
many Greek students feel this time of
year. To independent students, the activi-
ties offered a chance to get off campus
while their Greek friends were busy.

James McCullum said after the
Wednesday hike, “When I left for this at
8:30 tonight my entire dorm was empty,
no one was there, there were no students
because I assume they were all pledg-
ing and its a little disheartening to be the
only one there, so getting out and being
with other students and friends is amaz-
ing.” '

While the main attendees were inde-

pendent upperclassmen and freshmen,
James Dick, the Outing Club Director,
said, “I really would like to tap into the
juniors and seniors who have had as
much Natty-light as they can handle in
the same basement, with the same DJ,
with the same friends, the same collared
shirts, how much can you do that before
your bored out of your mind?”

A number of “Greek students who
have tired with the same old-same old”
were in attendance at events through the
week, taking advantage of the time to
unplug and get away from it all.

At Wintergreen Resort, students
zipped down the equivalent of a l0-story
building at speeds of up to 30 miles per
hour, covering the distance of 3 football
ﬁelds in a matter of seconds.

‘The Outing Club’s “Winter Welcome
Week” activities have been a regular of-
fering for the past nine years with some
years featuring more caving or winter
sports depending on weather and student
preferences.

One of the toughest parts of making
Outing Club activities successful is get-
ting the word out. Students who partici-
pate often in events fonn a solid nucleus
of “networkers” who get other students
involved by word of mouth.

This year, the weekend snow tubing
trip was particularly popular and a great
bargain with an Outing Club fee of 10
dollars for tickets usually worth 30 dol-
lars. Even though the snow has been
sparse, the slopes at Wintergreen were
covered with a thick layer of man-made
snow.

For those who prefer to climb, the
rollout rappel allowed students to scale a
40-foot tree before dropping from a plat-
form and swinging like a pendulum. An
extensive belaying system ensured com-
plete safety for the climbers and those
waiting their turn below.

For a less physically demanding ex-
perience, aspiring astronomers and hik-
ing enthusiasts enjoyed an easy ‘hike
to the summit of Cole Mountain for

Stargazing. A clear night sky offered a
beautiful view of the moon and with a
telescope, students could view Jupiter
and three of its moons. Just fewer than
20 students braved the crisp night air and
were rewarded with hot chocolate and
apple cider.

Future events to look forward
to include the Everglades Kayak
trip over February Break (only
a few seats still available) ’
and possible ski/snowboard-
ing day trips to local resorts.
Disc-Golf and Geocaching
are available daily and can be
inquired about at outing@wlu.
edu. Trips are formed largely
based on student interest.

The Outing Club challenges stu-
dents to do something completely dif-
ferent and unique on at least one of the
nights normally devoted to partying.

“Its the same Pole house, its the same
beer, its the same- mostly- the same
people,” said Dick. “Come do one new

thing: rappel off of Chambers Ridge,
learn how to ﬂy-ﬁsh with me, do an
o1'ienteer- ing course, do a geo-
cache, come
caving.”
