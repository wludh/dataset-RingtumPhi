Joe and Eddie began singing to-|

performing at sorority and fraterni-

Again through the urging of their |
high school director, they auditioned |
for a San Francisco television pro-
gram. They were so successful that
they were immediately signed on
for two weeks at a local night club,
the Crescent—an engagement which
was later extended for eight more
weeks.

Since then, they have appeared

Some of the other songs which
have made them popular are “Didn’t|

One of the best known and most
popular of the big name bands, the
Glenn Miller Orchestra, will appear
for the Fancy Dress Ball Friday
night, January 29, from 9-1. Original-
ly founded prior to World War II by
Glenn Miller, the Band is now direct-
ed by Ray McKinley, a close friend
of Miller’s. During World War II Me-
Kinley was a sergeant under Miller,
who was a major. After the war when
Miller was killed, McKinley was the
logical choice to take over the orches-

popular
Fancy Dress concert Saturday afiernoon

Since 1963 their records have been
consistently at the top of the hit
charts. “Where or When,” “Come
Back Silly Girl,” “The Way You
Look Tonight,” and “That’s My De-
sire” are among their most popular.

Their albums have been equally
successful, including ones such as
“Once Upon a Time,” “A Song For
Young Love,” “The Lettermen in
Concert,” and “College Standards.”

The Lettermen—Tony Butala, Jim
Pike, and Bob Engemann—had been
group vocalists in quartets and trios
for some time before they came to-
gether. Jim and Bob had been
friends at Bringham Young Univer-
sity. When Jim and Tony discovered
that their voices went well together,
Jim remembered Bob’s singing tal-
ent, and he was called in, and the
Lettermen were formed.

They were an immediate success.
Their first engagement was at the
Crescendo in Hollywood—the night
club in which Eddy and Joe also
launched their career. This was fol-
lowed by an appearance at the Pa-
ladium, and from then on they have
toured night clubs all over the coun-
try from Las Vegas to Washington,
D.C., to Pittsburgh to San Fran-
cisco. Recently they gave a concert
in the famous Hollywood Bowl.

Television audiences have heard
and seen them on many programs
during the past few years, includ-
ing the Ed Sullivan, Jack Benny,
Steve Allen, and Tonight shows. Red
Skelton was so impressed that he
had them back three times. Many
other entertainers agree with come-
dian George Burns that “the Letter-
men’s sound and performance will
send them through the roof of show
business.”

College audiences agree, too; the
Lettermen have given over 350 col-
lege concerts and being asked
back for more.

Part of the Lettermen’s style is
their attitude that they enter-
tainers well vocal group.
All of them do solos, since they be-
lieve that this makes for a more in-
teresting Their night club acts
have been known to include comedy,
vocal impressions, and instrumentals,
as well as songs

According to their fans, of course,
the Lettermen style really lies in the

Comments on Contact

The projected IFC sponsored CONTACT Weekend has
received favorable comment from many quarters as a student
endeavor to promote intellectual achievement. Some of the
most significant comment has come from several of the guests
that have been invited, but because of previous arrangements
will not be able to attend the Weekend.

The following quotes are an example of the comment and
encouragement that have been received by Chairman Blaine
Brownell of the CONTACT Steering Committee:

“Clearly, this will be a student-speaker forum quite out
of the ordinary, I only wish it were possible for me to be pres-
ent during the sessions this March...I hope you and your
associates ... will accept my best wishes for a succesful year

of CONTACT.”

NORMAN COUSINS, Editor
The Saturday Review.

*

“The CONTACT symposium .

*

. . which you have dis-

cussed with me, promises to be exceptionally useful and inter-
esting. The year’s careful planning which will have gone into
it should ensure the high standard of content, participants, and
organization for which you and your colleagues have so con-
scientiously striven. I wish you all success in your work.

*

DEAN ACHESON
*

“T certainly agree with Dean Acheson that this unusual
and greatly needed program should prove exceedingly worth-
while. All those who helped bring it into being are to be con-
gratulated on their sound and imaginative approach. It is sure

to be a stimulating experience .

.. | wish you a highly success-

ful beginning for this fine endeavor.”
DAVID ROCKEFELLER, President
The Chase Manhattan Bank

*

*

“Tt sounds like a most stimulating pprogram, and I am truly
sorry that I cannot accept your most gracious invitation.”
JUSTICE ARTHUR GOLDBERG
United States Supreme Court

*

*

In addition to these written comments CONTACT has re-

ceived, is a call from ADLAI

STEVENSON ’s personal sec-

retary assuring the Steering Committee that “the Ambassador
thought highly of the goals and organization of CONTACT,
and would come if it were not for the heavy demands of the

U.N. Security Council during the monh of March.”

*

*

The contact Weekend promises to be a worthy intellectual
endeavor. The work and planning that has gone, and is going
into the Weekend assures that it will be successful from the
viewpoint of planning, but it can only be truly successful with
full student support and participation.

By BRUCE W. RIDER
I have just slid from the innards of
my piggy bank six dimes and three
nickels, which combine to make the
seventy-five cents necessary for the

procuring of one copy of Ariel,
Washington and Lee’s foremost

magazine of student literary endea-
vor. Having read Ariel through and
through I will provide you, the
reader(s) with some jolly thoughts
concerning same.

(Just because the Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi people made mention of
Ariel in their Tuesday—or was it
Wednesday—edition of this week
is no reason for me not to tackle
the subject. We of the Friday staff
don’t talk to that Tuesday bunch
anyway and we certainly don’t read
their newspaper.)

Allow me to state first of all,
proximally and for the most part as
we say in Philosophy 275, that I
like the color of the cover. A truly
great shade of yellow, a veritable
golden sun-drenched literary cover.
I do wish they had used some sort
of transparent ink instead of that
heavy black stuff for listing the title
on the cover—I had a devil of a
time trying to read what was going
on underneath. I was really getting
interested in what Pro. was saying

to Mira. and what Ari. said when he
came bursting in on them. And in
the thick of things Mira. had to fall
asleep. It looked like they all were
having themselves quite a little time
there.

The two illustrations were really
magnificient. The inside front cover
is a close-up of a tiny section of
Van Gogh's Sunflowers, and the back
inside cover is a photograph of a
coward eating a lemon.

Turning now to the more literary
aspects of Ariel, I should like to
point out that in listing the staff
on the first page, all the names come
out to the end of the line, which
is one hell of an accomplishment.
Good work men.

Incidentally, I liked the stories
and other stuff, but found some of
the poetry to be a little, well, dirty.
Perhaps the poets are trying to
qualify for the big time: the South-
ern Collegian.

The best writing, of course, was
the shirt ad on the back cover. Talk
about your clean-cut style, mighty
metaphors and socking  similies.
Whoo boy.

Other features which endear this
issue of Ariel to the reader are its
nice size—it fit well into the hand—

By BRETT W. HAWKINS
Assistant Professor of
Political Science

One of American conservatism’s
most frequently-voiced complaints
against reform liberalism is that the
latter’s plans usually bring about
“unintended consequences.” Thus
Professor Warren Nutter recently
noted in an address at Washington
and Lee that urban renewal pro-
grams destroy more housing units
than they replace, thus forcing
people to double up and exacerbating
the social problems caused by con-
gestion. Milton Friedman, another
conservative economist (or “liberal”
if you prefer), has been most effec-
tive in cataloguing the undesirable,
unintended consequences of many
of the specific programs which liber-
als have gotten through Congress.
And Senator Goldwater himself has
frequently urged that when changes
are proposed the burden of proof
should be on the proponents of
change ,who must demonstrate in
addition that the means they employ
will not bring abount unintended
consequences.

Homework Undone

In a word, the concept of “unin-
tended consequences” is a favorite
of American conservatives, and yet
most of them appear to have over-
looked the probable consequences
of the kind of Goldwater defeat that
virtually every informed observer
was predicting. The reasons for this
are not entirely clear. A few con-
servatives, perhaps, were pure
ideologues (whether classical liberal
or neo-conservative) and uninterest-
ed either in the future of the Repub-
lican Party or in the future of the
two party system ;a few, perhaps
possessed a kind of political death
wish ;but most, it seems to me,
simply failed to do their homework.

Knockout Blow

What are the probable conse-
quences of Goldwater's massive
failure and, more to the point, how
many of them were predictable
before the campaign got under way?
Within the Republican Party, of
course, the likely consequences is
a marked revulsion against those
“responsible” for the debacle. Such
a reaction is both traditional and
understandable. The point, how-
ever, is that by supporting Gold-
water in 1964 the conservatives,
whose power had always stemmed
from their stragetic position in the
Republican Party (although not ex-
clusively so) and in Congress—not
from numbers—placed their best
weapons in grave jeopardy and at
poor odds.

Look at from a slightly different
standpoint, the November election

 

 

also delivered a knockout blow to

Unintended Consequences
Of Goldwater’s Candidacy

“Goldwaterism,” however one wishes
to define that term. If this phenom-
enon reappears at all it will almost
certainly be in a much altered form.

Conservative Victories
In addition the election endang-
ered a whole series of substantive
victories which conservatives had
been winning over the years. Among
such victories, according to Will-

Hank Williams’ Biography
Subject Of Good Flick For
Country And Western Fans

By JAMES JENNINGS

In To Kill a Mocking Bird, Scout
talks of bringing Boo Radley into
the limelight and says that if Boo
is brought out it will be like killing
a mockingbird. Your Cheating Heart
deals with the same kind of thing
only the mockingbird is Hank Wil-
liams, who in the movie is brought
into the light and killed.

Hank Williams, who has been
dead for over ten years stands as
the outstanding figure in Country
and Western Music. His songs are
sung every Saturday night over
WSM, and periodically a wave of
Hank Williams memorial albums hits
the market. This man still has fans
everywhere and Your Cheating
Heart will probably bring on another
wave of Williams’ memorials, for
Country and Western fans are among
the most loyal to their idols, and
will never let their man go as long
as there is a record to be heard.

Your Cheating Heart is handicap-
ped by the fact that much of Hank
Williams’ life cannot be disclosed if
he is to remain a popular figure in
the city as well as the country.
However, fear of success, his desire
to just live as he pleases, and his
love for down home music. George
Hamilton does a commendable job
portraying Hank Williams and at
times even resembles the Alabama
boy.

The movie leads us to believe
that Hank’s wife drove him to his
aleoholic state which brought death
and that it was she who killed the
mockingbird by trying to make him
sophisticated. There is probably some
truth in this, but Hank Williams
loved the spotlight and his fear was
of losing it, something which is only
intimated in the movie.

Your Cheating Heart is a good flick
even if you do not like Hank’s type
of music. It is in line with many
biographical flicks that have come
out, but it has a better script than
most, and far better acting than just
about al lof them. “The good Lord
willing and if the creek don’t rise”
you ought to go see it.

Fact and Fiction of Interfraternity Snowball Fight

Fact

By JIM AWAD
War Correspondent

The usual serenity of Lexington
was shattered this week as W&L
students had their final fling before
entering that horrible exam period.
It was a typical Monday afternoon;
the students were cither busy pre-
paring to meet their creator the
following week or recuperating from
the previous weekend. With snow
still on the ground, the DU’s and
Kappa Sigs indulged themselves in
a small snowball skirmish

But the skirmish developed into
an idea. The enemies decided to
unite and launch surprise attacks
on a number of unsuspecting houses.
SPE was the first target; “Operation
Surprise” had begun. There being
too few people in the SPE house

for a good fight, a few windows were |
broken and the force moved on down |

the street to the Sigma Chi House

Here too, most of the members
had dispersed to lab, library,
apartment. Resistance by the few
remaining Sigma Chi's was short-
lived and futile, and Sigma Chi suf-
fered casualties amounting to
windew panes. “Operation Surprise”
was a succem

Massive Retaliation
Unbeknown to the DU's and Kap-

sik

pa Sigs, however, the battle was
far from finished. At 7:00 p.m., the
thoroughly inflamed Sigma Chi's

and SPE's gathered before the SPE
house for “Operation Retaliation.”
They were joined there by some
FLJI'S from next door. The leaders
gave the word, and around 150 stu-

denta moved silently toward the
DU house
All was quiet at the DU house at

 

or’

been finished some time before, and next tried to drive the attackers,
off with a barrage of coke bottles, |

the DU’s still in the house were set-
thing down to their regular study
routine. Then suddenly, unexpect-
edly, all hell broke loose. The front
yard was filled with screaming at-
tackers. A barrage of snow and ice
went smashing through the most
vunerable front windows. The raid-
ers quickly removed the window
screens from the windows that had
them, and a fresh set of panes were
destroyed.

As a couple of Lexington squad
cars stood helplessly by, the DU's
tried in vain to fight back. An at-
tempt to rally out the front door
resulted in the DU front hall being
raked with snaw balls. The DU's

=—

—

but the only effect of this tactic was
to provide the raiders with fresh, and
much more effective, ammunition.
Someone even threw a chair down
from the third floor.

After the annihilation of the DU
house, the strike force moved on
Kappa Sigma. The Kappa Sigs were
forewarned, however, and were able
}to push the attackers out of range
of the house before too many win-
dows could be trashed.

The Sigma Chi's SPE’S, and FIJI's
next retired to their houses to pre-

pare for a counter-counter-attack
The SPE’s barricaded their win-

 

dows with bandstands, and the Sig-

 

ma Chi's shoveled away all the
snow in the vicinity of their house.

Further bloodshed was avoided,
however, by the Hill, whose benign
influence made both sides see the
wisdom of an armistice—at least
until Fancy Dress is over.

7:25 pm. Monday night. Dinner had! rather vicious consequences, i resulted in an unparalleled interfraternity snowball, botile, and brick battle,

All was quiet in the fraternity
house. The brothers had settled
down in their rooms for a night of
study; the close, pipe-smoking group
had taken its usual place in the
corner of the living room. (Tonight
their topic was the book of Job.)
Some had gone to bed early.

Outside the house, a blanket of
snow covered and silenced. Harold
Goon had just fallen asleep when
the phone rang:

Hullo?

Hullo?

You hear? Dean Rodriquez. Is the
president of your house there? Hf
so, tell him Id like to speak to
him.

Yes sir! (pause) I'm sorry sir, but

nol too tired to listen to what Harled

Generals Lose 12 Straight
Seek Win Here Tonight

By GUY UNANGST

Washington and Lee’s basketball losing streak is reaching
record-making proportions—but it could end tonight.

Last night’s 87-63 defeat by Bridgewater is W&L’s 12th
*non-win” of the season, and 13th in succession.

The all-time General futility record
game of the 1957-58 season through*————

the first 15 games of the following
year, before W&L finally beat Ran-
dolph-Macon by six points in the
season finale.

The whole disaster began March 1,
1958, in Dom Flora’s final game.
Flora, with 2,310 points holds the
school’s career scoring record, but
he couldn’t stop Villanova. The Wild-
cats started the 16-game streak, 71-
46..

Tonight W&L gets a shot at No.
14—or No. 1—against North Car-
olina Wesleyan here. The Methodist
school is also having a bad year, and
lost to Lynchburg College before
Lynchburg had Wayne Proffit and
Ronnie Pugh, who combined for 57
points as Lynchburg edged W&L by
six. Game time is 8:30.

Both Jeff Twardy and Larry Per-
rault are unlikely to play, Twardy
because of a twisted knee, Perrault
a sprained ankle

One Win in 23 Tries

If it weren’t for a lapse late last
season, when W&L beat RPI, that
record would have been broken long
ago. The Generals have lost 22 of
their last 23 games.

Still, it’s only the school’s third
best losing streak. From the fall of
1951 through the winter of 1953,
W&L lost 15 straight. The 1957-59
streak, however, had the benefit of
what may well have been W&L’s
worst loss—to Virginia Tech by
105-24.

Freshman guard Perrault, lately
a starter, missed Monday’s Pfeiffer
game because of a Naval Reserve
meeting .He’d missed so many they
said they’d draft him if he didn’t go.

For a change, Monday’s 81-69 loss
can’t be laid to fouls and rebounds
True, W&L fouled 25 times, but no
one fouled out and Pfeiffer made
only 21 one-pointers. W&L scored
almost as many, 19 in 21 attempts,
and out rebounded the Falcons, 46-
44, a truly unique experience.

The problem was a 25 per cent
first half shooting performance. W&L
hit only 10 of 40, fell 10 points back,
and never could catch up. In all, it
missed an even dozen shots from
directly under the basket.

Sweitzer Leads Scorers

Latest statistics, through Monday’s
game, show Steve Sweitzer still
leading team scorers. He’s averag-
ing 12.6 points a game to lead Dick
Livingston (12.3) and Fred Mindel
(11.7).

Sweitzer also leads the team with
a 50.5 accuracy mark, although Min-
del leads from the foul line with a
78.6 percentage on 33 of 42 free
throws. Bob Spessard leads re-
bounders with 9.9 per game.

W&L opponents, however, con-
tinue to make all this academic.
They're averaging 95.5 points a game.

Frosh Lose To Bridgewater

Washington and Lee’s freshman
basketball team kept its perfect
record intact yesterday as they lost|
to the Bridgewater College JV’s in
a game there by an 86-62 score.
W&L is now 0-7.

Bridgewater jumped off to a quick |
lead carly in the game and never |
were in any trouble. They took a}
48-23 lead with them into the dress-
ing room after the first half.

The second half featured a W&L
comeback, but it was the old story
of too little too late. Bridgewater
was outscored by Washington and
Lee 39-38 making the final score
86-62.

John Hulsizer led General scorers
in the game as he came up with 15.
Jim Madison chipped in with 13
and Bill Rassmussen added 10.
Leading all scorers was Bridge-
water’s Fischer who scored 17, Ellis
added 14 and Moore bucketed 10.

they will go against Virginia Bpisco-

A batch of W&L swimming rec-

That was the prediction of coach
Norris Eastman, who described
the Carolinians as “the best we'll
face all year.” The Greenville, N. C.,
school, which is a traditional swim-
ming power, went on from a 57-38
win over the Generals last year to
take second in the NCAA College

best times of the season, Eastman
said. The meet is set to begin at

Bowling Tops
I-M Activity

By JOHN BEAGLE

Due to exams, this has been a
slim week in intramurals. About the
only thing happening was bowling
on Tuesday night. Sigma Nu defeated
DU by forfeit, NFU upset defending
champs Kappa Sig, 3-1, and Phi
Kap beat PEP, 4-0.

To all those interested in hand-
ball, there will be a summary after
exams with the favorites heading
into the finals.

Phi Kap Leads Overall

At the halfway point in the intra-
mural season, Phi Kap leads the
standings with 495 points, followed
by SAE at 463 and ZBT with 461. It
looks like any one of these three
could be the overall winner.

None of these three are strong in
handball, but both SAE and ZBT
should make the basketball finals.
All three should also make the
bowling finals. Look for a real fight
all the way to the end.

In the standings for the Intercol-
legiate Trophy, unofficially Delt has
regained the top it had held over
the last six years, except for the
last year when it came in second.
Pick Delt to win this race with no
trouble.

Strictly predicting, the race for the
Grand Athletic Championship will
again be tight this year. Delt and
Phi Kap have the best chance and
ZBT should be rated as the best
dark-house. Indeed the second se-
mester will see some stern competi-
tion among the fraternities for the
top prizes.

Hawkins On Repercussion Of Goldwater’s Loss |

(Continued from page 2)

moore Kendall, a leading neo-conser-
ative political scientist, were the re-
strictive immigration laws, the refus-
al to evpand public power, the suc-
cessful defense of the House Com-
mittee on Nn-American Activities,
the relatively loose income tax laws,
and a minimum of federal aid to ed-
ucation. One should probably also in-
clude medicare and the heretofore
largely successful defense of the
strong committee, weak party sys-
tem in Congress.

All of these conservative victores
have been placed in the gravest peril
bv the Johnson landside, not only
because the liberals can claim some
kind of a mandate for liberalism but
also because the new Congressional
line-up includes scarcely a corporal’s
guard of conservatives. The loss of
key committee positions is also per-
tinent here.

Blind Conservatives

Moreover the conservatives have
continued to play directly into the
liberals’ hands in an almost comic
manner. For example, one of con-
servatism’s best arguments against
liberal majoritarianism is that the
latter’s assumptions about majority
mandates cannot be adequately sup-
ported. But Senator Goldwater has|
claimed time and again that his 27
million votes are “conservative”
voes, thus inviting, if not forcing,
the counterclaim that Johnson's 43
million votes are “liberal” ones.

Another matter of interest to some

 

people calling themselves conserva-
tives is the fact that the civil rights |
movement (considered generally) |
has been sustained almost entirely |
by judicial and executive power—|
not legislative—and that there has|
never been a clear expression of |
national suppor for it. The problem |
of the lack of legislative support)
was met prior to November 3, and
the problem of a national “mandate”

Still another serious loss for con-
servatism stems from the fact that
during 1964 a  disproportionately
large number of new _ voters
registered Democratic. It is true, of
course, that more new voters had
been registering Democratic than
Republican in any case, but the evi-
dence suggests that in 1964 this
tendency was accelerated. For a
party still suffering from the enor-
mous disproportion that developed
during the depression such a ten-
dency raises the gloomiest of pros-
pects.

Other conservatives and/or Re-
publican losses include the enormous
reshuffling of state legislatures,
which is doubly important in view

The Collegian
Arrives For FD

(Continued from page 1)

Young called a meeting of the pub-
lications board and suggested a re-
volving board of editors composed
of those boys who had previously
worked under Baur.

The revolving board of editors
consists of Ken Caro, photographer;

Peter Kintz, staff cartoonist; Jim
Crothers, managing editor and in

charge of lay-out; Scott Miller and
Denny Niedringhaus, staff writers;
and Jim DeYoung and Buck Wood-
ford, business manager and assist-
ant business manager, respectively.
With DeYoung acting as overall co-
ordinator, the revolving board of
editors will act as one editor and
be responsible for the overall co-
ordination.

and the two firm silver staples in the
center of the booklet. I would have
perhaps liked to have seen more
Ariel photography, but maybe that’s
just the Futurist in me.

All in all I would without equivo-

buy. The cover alone is worth the
price.

Dean R: ‘We’re

small ... Tiny.’

(Continued from page 2)

(Dean Rodriquez then proceeded
to tally up the damages the other
houses had incurred upon each
other).

“Now gentlemen, I’m sorry to have
kept you so long—especially sorry
for those of you who overcut by
missing their 8:25—but I think there
are some things we’ve got to get
straight! This is not a big university,
gentlemen. We are small, gentlemen.
Very small. Tiny. And we intend to
keep it that way. We operate in a
backward, stagnant, and poverty-
stricken little town, gentlemen, and
I assure you that they are doing all
they can to keep it that way. We've
got to hold up our end, gentlemen!
That is all.” (The fraternity presi-
dents then left. Outside, the snow
had begun to melt.)
