Eleven fraternities held initia-
tion rites last weekend, with
the remainder scheduled to
initiate new members in the
near future. Sigma Chi initi-

ated 16 to lead all houses this
year, but the Phi Psi’s stole the
show from them by initiating all
their pledges for the first time in
the history of the house.

Among houses which did not initi-
ate last weekend, most will hold in-
ductions next wekend. Phi Ep will
initiate on February 21, and ZBT
on March 6.

Sigma Phi Epsilon
SPE was the first to initiate its
new members, with ceremonies on
Friday night. Those who received
the official badge were Coleman
Blake, Tom Doss, Mike Dunn, Strait
Fairey, John Godehn, Jim Lowe,

Grebanier Speaks at VMI
In University Center Plan

The University Center in Virginia
will present its first speaker of a
series at VMI’s Scott Shipp Hall,
room 318, on February 23. Profes-
sor Bernard Grebanier, a prolific
author and noted Shakespearing
critic entitles his topic “A Measure
of Shakespeare as Poet and Dram-
atist.”

Born in 1903, Professor Grebainer
studied to be come a concert pianist.
But during his last weeks as an un-
graduate at the City College of New
York, he was offered a_ position
there teaching Shakespeare the fol-
lowing year, and accepted. In 1930 he
received his Ph.D. from New York

the IFC, your columnist for the

The first and most startling news
of the evening was the IFC financial
report. It included approximately
$2,000 income and $3,965 expendi-
tures, thus contributing to an over-
all $1,542 deficit plus the foreign
student assessment of $1,200 yet to
be paid. The total for the year will
probably reach at least $2,742. Faced
with this deficit, the IFC voted to
pay off the debt with a general as-
sessment of all the houses

between 1928 and 1962, Mr. Gre-
banier completed more than fifteen

Writing criticism or Shakespeare,
however, was has not been the
professor’s only interest. Various of
his stories, essays, and poems have
appeared in such nationally known
periodicals as The New Yorker,

in the Washington and Lee Review,
entitled “Lady Macbeth of London,”

Ideas for Change

Among the various proposals for
change in the policy the following
were considered the most construc-
tive by Brown. The membership of
the committee should be larger and
subject to election by the students
rather than appointment by the EC.
There was also a plea for open hear-
ings and more lenient discipline.
Finally, one student proposed a sys-
tem of enforcement through the fra-
ternities. The fraternities would be
held responsible for violations of
their members.

Cold Check Report

W&L students have become re-
sponsible in their financial dealings
(Le., via cheeks), as the number of

to Jim Slay, chairman of the Cold

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

The University Infirmary

On Saturday night a junior varsity wrestler broke his
arm in two places in a match in Doremus Gymnasium.
Coach Norris Eastman correctly diagnosed the arm as
broken and sent the man to the infirmary. There, how-
ever, the victim was told that his condition was not very
serious, and that since the case was not an emergency,
he could not be sent to the hospital and the University
physician, Dr. Feddeman, could not see him.

On Sunday the arm was x-rayed and the double frac-
ture discovered by Dr. Feddeman, who wrapped the arm
back up in an Ace bandage and told the victim to come
back the next day, when the swelling would have subsided.

In this case the policy that a student must go through
the infirmary before receiving any medical treatment in
Lexington, could have resulted in serious trouble—and it
wouldn’t have been the first time. There is absolutely no
reason why a college man should be hindered in going to
the physician of his choice or in going to the hospital
when he thinks it necessary. Of course, the infirmary re-
plies that there is really no rule that W&L men can’t go
to outside physicians; but if this is so, where did the hos-
pital get the idea of an infirmary “okay” for W&L Men?
And why does a coach tell the men on his team they must
go through the infirmary? Worst of all, why does the
University refuse to accept an absence excuse from any
doctor other than Dr. Feddeman?

Beyond the usual exaggeration in stories about a
school physician, there is considerable justification in com-
plaints about the W&L infirmary. There is also consider-
able substance to some of the stories about students who
have been “mistreated” at the hands of the infirmary
staff; the sample case of last weekend is not one of the
worst examples. Criticism from the Ring-tum Phi has been
consistently modest, but it would not be difficult to find
students with stronger opinions on the subject of Dr. Fed-
deman and the infirmary. In this year of complete self-
study we hope the University will not neglect its infirmary
program, and that this long-standing problem area will
be improved in some measure.

 

The Collegian Answers Critics

The Fancy Dress issue of the Southern Collegian con-
tained one of the most hopeful developments in student
activities this year:the revival of the Collegian as a serious
vehicle of campus criticism. For the first time in recent
years the Collegian printed an editorial focusing its at-
tention chiefly on the danger that academic excellence
may be reached at the expense of the social graces which
supposedly characteize the “W&L gentleman.” The edi-
torial also commented on the library, the possibility of
separating the law school from the college, and the possi-
bility of allowing dates in the dormitories.

Each of these issues deserves the fullest consideration
of the administration as well as the student body. (Mem-
bers of the administration who have treated themselves
to the privilege of not reading the Collegian for many
years, would do well to give it one more chance.) In par-
ticular, the inadequacy of the library is a problem which
should be sharply outlined in the present self-study pro-
gram and ought to receive immediate attention.

The “new look” of the Collegian is less an innovation
than a return to traditional policies of the magazine, which
is in its fourth quarter-century of publication. It is defi-
nitely a change for the better, one which gives the maga-
zine a purpose other than to revel in its own obscenity—
a remarkable tendency of some past issues. And the Fancy
Dress reversion to a serious purpose, whether by coinci-
dence or not, was matched by some of the best articles—
and more of them—which have appeared in recent col-
umes of “the South’s most maligned magazine.” The
Fancy Dress issue is a good answer to the Collegian’s
critics, who were becoming more and more vocal.

The Vestiges of Hazing

Despite the fact that the administration and the IFC
have officially abolished Hell Week and “Help Week,”
several fraternities managed, as usual, to preserve last
week the essentials of their programs to degrade their
pledges. It is amazing that there exist such barbaric haz-
ing practices as were carried out in the last week; it is
even more fantastic that college men could pretend to
believe that this medieval terrorism can induce brother-
hood in the typically sophisticated young men of Wash-
ington and Lee's freshman class. And perhaps it is also
amazing that a college junior or senior should be willing
to waste his time in the horseplay of brotherhood-by-
degradation.

It is incumbent on the Interfraternity Council to
be more active next year in preventing Hell Week prac-
tices. Even more, it is incumbent on this year's pledges
to remember what hazing is like from the viewpoint of
the pledge. If they are able to retain a realistic viewpoint,
they will not support hazing next year as sophomores. Let
the freshmen remember that it is only a desire for ven-
gence which perpetuates hazing, and let them resolve now
that next year they will have no part of such “revenge”;
that they will have no part of activities which waste the
time of all concerned, which can benefit only the twisted.

Tuesday Columnist
It was just a lazy winter day. The
sun was shining, and it was warm.
It would have been a perfect day
to go off into the hills somewhere,
sit in the snow, and study for exams.
But on the Washington and Lee
campus, the students were so excit-
ed, they could hardly study. This
was student assembly day! Terrified
lest they break The Absence Rule,
(“We have but one rule...”) the
law students streamed forth from
Tucker Hall and raced to the mag-
nificent Doremus Auditorium. Huff-
ing and puffing in the other direc-
tion, a French professor slid past
the library on his way to his office.

He had forgotten his robe.

The students filed into the rear of

the auditorium, respectfully saving
the front seats for the faculty. The
place was packed. Some couldn’t
even see, and had to sit on the
wrestling mats on the balcony.

Soon the students were all seated,
awaiting the picturesque pageant
which was about to unfold for them.
The procession began with a dramatic
blast, as a scratchy recording of
Tachaikovsky’s “March of the Wood-
en Soldiers” blared forth from the
public address system. First came
someone carrying a beautifully dec-
orated wooden club on a_ velvet
pillow, but no one was quite sure
who he was. Then, bedecked in their
colorful black regalia, in all their
academic splendor, in marched the
faculty!

Delighted, the students with awe

  
 

drank in the sight of these men
marching past them—these men who
had guided them; these men who
had broadened their horizons; these
men who had nurtured their intel-
lectual curiosity; these men who
would be giving them exams the
next day. Some freshmen students,
woefully ignorant of their military
obligation, wondered why the ma-
rines in their dress blue uniforms
had infiltrated the academic line.
The procession completed, Presi-
dent Cole announced that Dr. Hodges
would give the invocation. Enthusi-
astically rising to the occasion, the
students stood up. Following the
invocation Dean Sprunt to a captive
audience gave a talk on Robert E.

Rives Looks Forward to “Thunderball”

 

Critic Praises “Man from Rio”

By MAC RIVES
Cinema Columnist

Sometimes there’s nothing to write
about. Not about movies, at least,
which are then discussed, inade-
quately (sic), through random notes.

Two Women has returned to the
Lyric. It’s from the Moravia novel
of the same name, which is to say it’s
bittersweet. The direction is by De-
Sica, in deterioration since Bicycle
Thief, but who still composes with
precision, an unusual, if here unex-
citing, characteristic. Moreover, the
acting is good, just as it was three
years ago, when Two Women first
played at the Lyric, and as it will
be the same time hence, in Lexing-
ton. Due preda. Raf Vallone is par-
ticularly good as the truck driver.

Goldfinger is completing a week's
run at the State. One either laughs
with Bond or he doesn't. The reac-
tien isn't so much conditioned by

one’s taste as it is at his frame of
mind (an extremely subtile distinc-
tion which can be overlooked). Still,
reluctantly, I am looking forward to
Thunderball and a better seat, the
latter with a concomitant absence
of anterior remarks, not previously
referred to: “She's terrible:” “They
expect me to believe that?”
Critics, reviewers, writers continue
to pose intelligent, much as another
personality pretends, again to have
scheduled an interesting array of
movies. Recently, an associate, en
route to High’s lee Cream, was drag-
ged into the foyer highlighted by
a blurred flame profie of Richard
Widmark. He was ,obviously enough,
then informed of the _ ensuing
month’s program. “I've got some real
good ones. “Yeah.” Aictually he has
booked That Man from Rio, chosen
Best Picture of 1964 by the New
York Film Critics, yet appropriately.

It features Jean-Paul Belmondo and
Francoise Dorleac and poison darts
and Brasilia. Carping becomes tire-
some and it is nice to be able to
praise and anticipated a movie, the
success of which, one judges, is to
be credited to the wild direction of
Philippe de Broca and the music of
Georges Delerue as well as to the
principals mentioned above. One can
apply the current criticism of God-
ard to de Broca—he allows private
film jokes to mar is work (ie., Dele-
rue’s score is a parody of that from
Black Orpheus); but it is more
likely that the viewer will forget
such relations, if he happens to be
aware of them, and enjoy the movie.
It's hard not to.

Also coming: The Magnificent Sev-
en, The Girl with the Green Eyes
and The Silence, the last predict-
ably exploiting the now-famous s-t
elisions.

The Pressure Mounts at Ampersand:
Dean Rodriguez Himself Is Stricken

By ARTHUR McBLAIR CROWLEY

In last week's article, I reviewed
the plight of the Eastern universit-
sity student, using the unfortunate
Chaz Bimberg as an example, At
the time of the incident, it was
generally believed that the stu-
dent was the only victim of col-
legiate pressures. This supposi-
tion was satisfactorily invalidated,
however, when:

At 8:00 in the morning on may 7,
1964, Hugo Redriguez, Dean of Men
at Ampersand University, was found
under his desk by the local authori-
ties. This led to immediate conjec-
ture among the members of the
demic community a to the reason
behind such a move on the Dean's
part. Was he hiding? Was he search-
ing for something that had fallen
en the floor? Was he dead”

Speculation rapidly mounted until
two weeks later when an official
statement was released by the Ad-
ministrative Committee which de-
elared: “The Dean was examining
the weave of his office rug.” Al-
though this did much to dispel the
apprehensions of many, other
skeptical individuals pointed out that
there were quite a number of anoml

“ca

more

alies in the report: a) There was no
carpet in the Dean’s office; b) It was
impossible to see the weave of the
carpet under the desk because it
was dark there; c) The Dean had
been under his desk for more than
a week ample time to discern not
only the pattern of his rug, but
that there was, in fact, no rug at all.

Twin Beds and a “Vague Unrest!”

Other embarrassing questions were
raised. How had the Dean's absence
gone unnoticed for such an extend-
ed period of time? To this query,
there were interesting replies

Mrs. Lolita Rodriguez: “Huge

have twin beds.”

(The following letter was not
written for the Ring-tum Phi but
was addressed to a member of the
W&L administration. It is printed in
the belief that the author, an alum-
nus, would wish his thoughts to be
made public.)

Dear Sir,

Thank you for Washington and
Lee University. This is not meant
to be dramatic or trite, but from
the heart. As an alumnus one isn’t
confronted with the rigors of the
academic world, although one never
forgets the honor system as a stu-
dent, or the importance thereafter of
being an honorable man.

The Air Force Academy scandal
portrays all too vividly the lack of
integrity in so much of our populous
today. How can one fail to differ-
entiate between telling on your six
year old sister, and upholding a code
of honorable conduct.

Washington and Lee was so for-
tunate to have been able to choose a
Student Body dotted by scholars
both above average and _ below,
thinkers, conformists. Christians and
Jews, but all of whom respected
and revered the system of honor.
This, more than any other quality
makes the phrase School of Gentle-
men meaningful.

Very Sincerely
WARREN R. WELSH

To the Editor:

I would like to protest the letter
from Mr. Naaman Fletcher printed
in the Friday Ring-tum Phi. Mr.
Fletcher is entirely mistaken in his
concept of the Benevolent and Pro-
tective Order of KKK, and indeed
he seems to attempt to lead the read-
ers of your paper into accepting an
image of our organization which is
highly unjust to it.

Actually the KKK is a service or-
ganization, not unlike the SSS, MM,
NOTO, and SWMSFC, and many
others. It performs many highly val-
uable services to the University and
the student body; indeed, without
the Loyal Order of KKK, as we are
also known, who knows what might
happen to the grand traditions of
W&L?

It is true that we favor a return
to the ancient traditions of the Old
South, but this University itself
sands for some of these traditions.
We only go a bit father.

The KKK, is, I might point out,
non-discriminatory. How could an
organization which backed Barry
Goldwater be discriminatory?

In closing, I would like to add that
I hope Mr. Fletcher and his ilk see
the light and cease and desist. If they
don’t, they are likely to find the
Loyal Order of the W&L Un-
American Activities Committee
breathing down their necks.

Sincerely,

THE GRAND LIZARD

W&L Is Third
In ‘Who’s Who’

Washington and Lee ranks third
among private liberal arts colleges
for men in number of graduates list-

Following Williams and Ambherst,
W&L has held the number three po-

appendix to the 1964-65 addition of
Who's Who states that “Williams,
Amherst, and Washington and Lee
seem to be the perennial leaders”
in number of graduates listed in
their category.

The other colleges in the top ten,
in order, are Haverford, Bowdin,

Six Records Fall In ODC Swimming Meet

Exam |Rigors Fail to Slow
Swimmers in 60 - 31 Rout

By SKIP CHASE
Tuesday Sports Writer
Supposedly out of shape after a two week exam lay-off, the
Generals, under the command of Coach Norris Eastman,
mastered five school records and one pool record while crush-
ing the Monarchs of Old Dominion, 60-31, in last Saturday’s

meet. .

team is far ahead of its opponents

In recently released statistics, the Washington and Lee wrestling

feat of the season swimmers Nelson
Head, Kester Denman, Bill Wildrick
and Bart Taylor smashed the pool
record set by Maryland in the open-
ing medley relay with a time of
3:41.3. In this same event freshman
Head set a school record for the
100-yard backstroke with a time of
57.8 seconds.

The next record to fall was the
200-yard individual medley in which
George Bokinsky lowered his own
mark to 2:09.1.

Wildrick followed suit by lower-
ing his own mark in the 200-yard
butterfly a significant three seconds
to 2:06.

In the most surprising feat of the
day, sophomore Taylor broke the
record for the 100-yard freestyle
with a time of 48.7.

The final record of the day was
set by Head who slashed eight sec-
onds off the existing school mark in
the 200-yard backstroke by going the
distance in 2:07 minutes.

Such surprising strength shown
Saturday prompted Coach Eastman
to look hopefully for an upset vic-
tory over American University in
Washington this Saturday.

Cagers Lose Fourteenth;
Jackets Stomp Generals

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team added a new distinction
to this season by becoming Saturday
night the 42nd consecutive victim for
Randolph-Macon on the Jackets
home court. The Ashland, Virginia,
ball club found victory number 42
easier than most as they rolled to
a 119-65 conquest of the Generals.

with 22 points, while Bob Minuetello
added 18. Fred Mindel led the Gen-
erals with 21 points. Dick Livings-
ton had 14 and Bob Spessard got 10.
The Generals had a phenomenal
shooting percentage from the foul
line, hitting 19 of 22. Mindel was
13 for 13 on charity tosses.

The Generals’ record is now 1 and

How many of you can give the
starting line-up of the 1950 Phila-

whiz kids? Better yet, who was the
pitcher who served up Roger Maris’
61st home run ball?

Do these sound like ridiculous
questions? They are no more ridicu-
lous than trying to find something
worthy of mention on the local ath-

 

a good reason for the team’s 6-1 record.

W&L has, in the individual matches, outscored the other men, 188-
128. If this does not seem too overwhelming, the General grapplers
have added 19 pins and five forfeits to their total, while holding the
visitors to five pins and no forfeits.

As a team, Coach Miller’s charges have outscored the opposition
171-60 on their way past such foes as Duke, N.N.C., N.C. State, and

Prior to Saturday night’s abor-

Macon, Coach Canfield’s “whistle-

“Whistleball” has replaced basket-

the Generals from oblivion.

Speaking of Livingston, I might
mention that it is a pity that Dick)
has had the misfortune this year
to play on a team that has been able
to win only one game. Livingston
deserves more credit than that which
he receives from the students and

playing for a losing ball club is not
conducive to getting more than local
recognition. I hate to think how

The Wall, a one-page bulletin pub-
lished by THRUST will make its
first appearance on Wednesday,
February 10. It will be, according
to a THRUST spokesman, a collec-
tion of “brief opinion, sharp satire,
cornball homilies, and pithy com-
mentary.” Material for The Wall will
come from students, faculty, and a
varied group of periodicals.

Bob Stack, an SPE pledge from
Silver Spring, Maryland, will be ed-
iting the bulletin, with assistance
from a committee which includes
Senior Craig Cotton; Junior Jeff
Skarda; and Freshman John Godehn,
Ric Berard, and Steve Saunders.

Styled after the model of a posted
newssheet of the same name at the
University of Edinburgh, The Wall
will be placed on all campus bulle-
tin boards every two weeks. When
asked if there would be any prob-
lem with bulletins being ripped down
by dissenters, Stack said that, “There
is always the group which is going
to display its intolerance of ideas
not in agreement with its own. How-
ever, we believe that the majority
of the Student Body is sufficiently
mature and responsible to see the
foolishness of such a course. We
don’t expect a big problem in that
area.”

The Wall may be mailed to P.O. Box

The turtleneck identifies the HOOT. A high-
standing, fold-over turtleneck of rugged rib-
knit, or a “mock” turtle—the high crew-neck—
gives the HOOT a handsome, masculine look.
Heavier, bulkier yarns, and bold patterns, especially the Scandina-
vian designs, are the thing. Brilliant blues, greens, reds and golds
in solid or multi-colored combination stripes and argyles make the
HOOT Sweater an eye-catching invigorating new campus fashion.
HOOT Slacks in tan and bronze corduroy are tapered, trim and
pleatiess, and coordinate perfectly with all ingredients of the HOOT
LOOK.

BABY, IT’S COLD OUTSIDE! But with the proper accessories, you

won't have to worry about the outside weather story. Gloves, often
ignored by college men, are much more than hand-warmers; they
are an integral part of the fashion picture. Sturdy pigskin in the
natural “cork” shade with linings of lambswool or fur are favored
on the cold-weather campus, as are tan knitted wool gloves with
leather palms. Crisp and correct are woolen mufflers in solid colors
or bold Tartan designs. In scarves, the knitted cross-stripes or
border stripes have the edge.

INSIDE OUT, the new reversible outercoat is a

lively, practical way to add variety to your out-
erwear wardrobe. An offshoot of the Tow Coat,
it has a bold plaid wool on one side, and cordu-
roy on the other, and is characterized by a
bulky-knit shaw! collar that stands or rolls down
flat. Rugged and lightweight, it makes an ex-
cellent addition to your mid-winter apparel.

LET IT SNOW! With a sturdy lining to seal out

the cold, you'll be ready for that time-honored

 

 

campus tradition: the annual snowball fight.
There’s a wide-open, warm-up selection to
choose from in color and type of lining. Pile
fabrics, ranging from natural-fiber, natural
color alpaca pile and acrylic fiber piles in bril-
liant colors are high on the popularity list, as
are bright, nylon fleece linings. A real pace-setter is the zip-out
ning of patterned knit. Many linings spill over on the collar fac-

ing for a snappy exterior accent.

So much for our mid-winter checkup. Next month, we'll survey
the exciting fashion news in stretch fabrics. Button-down collar
shirts, sportswear and rainwear will all fall under the fashion eye
So long until then,
