Statement
In summing up his candidacy,
Mindel said:
“I do not believe the Executive

Committee has lived up to its poten-
tial nor fulfilled its responsibility in
taking the lead in student govern-
ment this year, and strongly feel
that something must be done to re-
verse this situation. I find a crisis in
leadership on our campus where
the principle of “active representa-
tion” has been neglected, and my

office is to provide responsible gov-|
ernment which actually, rather than
theoretically represents student con-,|

sencus. I feel I learned a tremen-|
dous amount serving this year on

;the EC, not only in regard to what
| this body did or has done, but also in
| regard to what it did not do or has
not done in the past.

“This experience, coupled with an
energetic drive and a spirit of open-
mindedness which I feel 1 have es-
tablished, gives me a sincere con-
fidence in my ability to provide lead-
ership which will initiate well
as oversee, and which can bring
back a fundamental contact with the
student which to a large degree has
lost.”

eae To Run For Secretary

Miller Goes After Fancy Dress

Nominations on the University Party’s slate for the up-
coming Big Four election are Chuck Walker for President,
Dave Marchese for Vice President, Joe Framptom for
Secretary, and Joe Miller for Fancy Dress President. Party
Chairman James Jennings announced these choices shortly
after the Party’s clique meeting last Wednesday night. Their
nomination came one week prior to the University election
which will be held next Thursday in the Student Union.

The initial response by clique representatives and others
inside the Party was that their slate was qualified, balanced,
and as Chairman Jennings put it “unbeatable.” Optimism was

high in the University Party for its success not only i in this
election but in the not-far-distant*
class elections. Outside observers |
were somewhat surprised at the
University Party’s apparent unity.
Most had anticipated a party break.

The big news in this election so
far is that all the University Party’s
candidates except Walker may run
unopposed. The nine houses outside

THE RING-TUM PHI

Instant Politics

Ah, spring has come. As the snows melt and the days grow
longer, Pan skips through the Shenandoah Valley, announcing
the annual phenomenon whose all-encompassing affects exempt
not a soul,

To Lexington, Pan carries the expectation of great events:
Goshen becomes congested with inner tubes, Tanya returns,
and the throbbing political id of W&L erupts in campus elec-
tions.

This year, as in every year, the campus will immerse itself
in the art of “instant politics,” where within two weeks it makes,
destroys, and reconstructs strong parties to select, endorse,
campaign for, and elect officers to guide the student body
through the forthcoming year. And finally, as a farewell tribute
to both its efforts of the preceding two weeks and its newly-
elected, the campus promptly devoids itself of political afhlia-
tion, and returns to reap the benefits of Pan, Goshen and
Tanya.

Although this system itself has undergone considerable
criticism, the Ring-tum Phi recognizes its value as a practical
experience in political entanglements. Consequently it en-
courages everyone to participate regardless of party (or
parties). As is reflected in campus attitude, the importance lies
not in the results of these two weeks, but within the activities

yielding these results. H. S. E.

A Realistic Outlook

From all reports and appearances, the clique nominations
for the University Party was a fair and conscientious effort by
the Party to put forth the best candidates available. The nomi-
nations were entirely free of the back-stabbing, appeasements,
and open hostilities which have plagued the unstable political
parties of the past. Though we regret that the University Party
will have no unified opposition, it is nevertheless a healthy sign
for the political condition of this campus that a clique can
operate in such a fashion as to produce efficiently a slate of in-
dividuals who represent the Party as a unit and not as the fac-
tions within it.

As a result of the unity displayed by the University Party
in its nominations, it should be a strong block in the Big Four
elections and, having to assume its success there, should be
doubly strong in the Class Elections.

Although we don’t think it is our function to support or
oppose any of the candidates who have been named so far, we
would very strongly urge that students do not vote on the basis
of whether a candidate has or has not the support of a party.
Though this is a trite election request, we justify it in that votes
against the Party and not positively for either candidate could
be a real danger in this election as a result of the unrealistic
efforts of some groups to malign the party name as necessarily
unrepresentative. Those who have sought to do so obviously
did not realize the ability of the clique to operate in such an
exemplary fashion as it did last Wednesday night.

The candidate’s personal ability to fulfill the responsibilities
of his office should be the electorate’s concern, not the nature
of his backing or the image he conveys.

‘Too Harsh
This editorial appeared in the March 18 edition of the
Hollins Columns during the fraternity controversy aired by
Mr. Beardslee.

The time has come when we can no longer refrain from
adding our two cents to the Beardslee-W&L controversy. At
a penny a word—"Too Harsh.”

Not only too hard on the boys, Mr. Beardslee, and unfair
to single out W&L for the lashing, but too hard on us. We're
self-respecting, we go to the fraternity houses, and have every
intention of continuing to go to them, because we see very
little of what has been discussed as the “usual.” Having at-
tended a goodly number more fraternity parties at W&L than
the chaplain is likely to have attended, I’m ready to defend
them. Not too many of the boys can be called ‘golden drunks”
and even fewer can be “loose lipped”’ before one of their fra-
ternity brothers steps in to protect our virgin ears. (And
speaking of virgin ears—they hear a bit more in the Hollins
dorms than they do in the Lexington fraternity houses—so
maybe the clean-up ought to begin at home.)

In other words, everybody talks about the “numerous”
gross incidents, but it seems likely that when one occurs every-
body discusses it and exaggerates it so that it seems, by the
amount of conversation, to have happened ten times. Neither
can we be called whores for not taking a drunk girl being strip-
ped from a fraternity house if we've never seen a drunk girl
being stripped.

Finally, we'd like to defend the fraternities on general
principles. Different fraternities are made up of different types
of boys and when you date in a particular house you generally
find a whole group of boys that you like, and that have similar
party manners to the person you date, If he respects you, so
will his fraternity brothers. Also, it is the brother who looks
out for his other brothers—and keeps them in line. If there
are houses at W&L where all sorts of crudities occur, then I
agree with Mr. Beardslee, I wouldn't want to go in them. How.
ever, I haven't been in one yet and am inclined to think that
there aren't many there.

 

By ANN JONES
Hollins College

The problem, I think, was born with the man. It is not that
we lack at Hollins the possibility for controversy, the potential
for vital discussion, the other sides of the question. It is that
we are unable or unwilling to ask with honesty the questions
that are meaningful.

We live in our 670 individual worlds as they have been
given to us and defined for us, and we are afraid to wonder.
We live in “that seasonless world where we laugh, but not all
our laughter, and weep, but not all our tears.” We neither

Individual, Social Aspects of Man Discussed

BY CHRIS BARGHOLTZ

February 25th there was a very interesting question asked
in the Hollins Columns, The question, or rather the “theory
with a big question mark,” was put forward by Anne Jones.
As I felt it was a very important one, I would like to contribute
a few question marks and exclamation points to the discussion.

What Anne Jones seems to say is that we ought to stop for
a moment to think, and not to hesitate to ask the basic ques-
tions: what? and why? about life. I wonder what we are sup-
posed to find. The article suggests that we will run into a fear
somewhere deep inside, a fear that we have to fight, and “by

 

Why? Perhaps it is uneasy fear.*
Perhaps we sense that if we look
below our make-up and MecMullens;
our liberal doctrines or our conserva-
tive protestations; our reputations
and images; our letters from Bill and
dozen long-stemmed red roses; our
distinguished families and accept-
able friends; our debutante initiation
or our staunch and pietistic refusal
to be one; the SAE’s and Candy and
Camus, or our imperceptive judg-
ments against them; our convincingly
intelligent and apparently intellec-
tual comments and questions in class;
Beethoven and James Brown and
Picasso and Morgenthau; our judg-
ments about others; Boston, Paris,
Atlanta; our refusal to commit our-
selves or our commitment to so
many things that is no commitment;
behind all this, we silently fear,
there is nothing worth a damn. We
have let all this produce us; we
know it, and we cannot admit it. We
are happy this way, we say, some-
times. Most of the time we don't
wonder about happiness; we are

know we are not joy-filled and we
have been told so many times that
college is the time to be happy, to
enjoy the last hours of freedom. If
we admit we are not happy, we
don’t want to know ultimately why,
for we are afraid of the answer.

We are ultimately dishonest, and
honesty is the basis for any intel-
lectual and meaningful venture. We
accept our rationalizations and our
escapes with ingeniously devised
reasons, so intelligent that they de-
ceive ourselves.

Se we read and talk and think
and act, but we do not know why we
do and we cannot or will not ask.

How can it be that we are so old
in years and so child-like in our
lives? Perhaps it is because we have
never been confronted with a ques-
tion from which there is no exit,
from which we cannot escape by the
means we are so adept at employing
unconsciously. Perhaps we have
never known a person whose very
existence inescapably threatened
ours, whose way of life denied our
own and from whom we could not
turn to our friends and defenders.
Perhaps we have never allowed our-
selves to be alone, and to stand
alone. Perhaps we don’t care at all;
perhaps we care so much that it is;
agony, and we have been told that
suffering is evil and to be avoided
Perhaps we have been loved so long
by so many that we don’t know how
to love.

As long as we allow ourselves to
live this life of half-conscious pas-
sivity and of dishonesty, we can-
not talk about the intellectual cli-
mate at Hollins. Intelligence is not
automatically intellectual; relevant
and piercing commentary in class is
not automatically meaningful; debate
and discussion can be fruitless, if
they lack subjective honesty.

Due to the somewhat vague knowl-
edge that the average student has
concerning the Student Control
Committee, this writer shall en-
deavor to clarify the purpose, the au-
thority and the functions of the
Committee.

The Committee consists of a Chair-
man, two members-at-large, and a
representative from the Law School,
the senior class, the junior class, and
the sophomore class. Members are
appointed to the Committee by the

A Judiciary Board

To be a little more definite than
the University catalogue the Com-
mittee is not a law enforcing agency,
but rather a judiciary
hears complaints. Complaints about)
student behavior generally fall into
one of three categories: complaints
from other colleges; complaints from
the town of Lexington; and com-
plaints from students. These com-
plaints usually reach the committee
respectively from the following
sources: Dean Atwood; Mr. Bob
Murray; and Joe Wheeler, the Com-

siraid to affirm our disgust. Wel Lege Sets U P Standards
Of Collegiate Good, Bad

By JANET P. PINKERTON
Assistant Dean, Hollins College
Lecturer in English

Because of the inappropriateness
of bringing up some of these things
in class, I would like to present here
the following worldview:

Things That Are Bad:

The great American middle class.

“Individualism,” because usually a
justification for selfishness.

Founder's Day.

Surburban Protestantism.

Station wagons.

Edgar Allen Poe.

Expectations of “democracy” in
countries (most of the world) ‘hat

do not have Anglo-Saxon traditions. |

Patriotism.

The sacredness of the American
Revolution but the villainy of all
others.

The circumstances of the arrest
of Walter Jenkins.

Middle-class morality, because hy-
pocritical.

Belief that the whole world will
be good when they think and act
just like us.

The _ Eisenhower - Khrushchev
standards of art.

The Reader's Digest, The National
Geographic, and the Encyclopedia
Britannica.

Things That Are Good;

Sympathy with groups (like the
Black Muslims which exist because
of our callousness, injustice, and re-
fusal to understand and sympathize
with others who weren't raised just
like us.

Refusal, therefore, to judge such
groups by our own outraged stand-
ards.

| Honesty.

Herman Melville.

Bob Dylan.
Revolution in certain Latin Amer-
jican countries in attempt to over-
| throw long-standing injustice.

Acceptance of methods of over-
throwing injustices that nevertheless
do not conform to sacred Anglo-
Saxon traditions.

 

An uncompromising, compassion-
ate humanism.

Refusal to be smug and compla-|
cent.

Antonioni movies.

Beards, because they reject the|
gray-flannel-suit image.

fighting this uneasy fear’ we can create ourselves in the re-
sicunemper saree ——————=kfusal to continue to let ourselves, all

unaware, be created.” But is this
really true? I'm afraid we will find
nothing, a finding that will throw
us only deeper into our despair.What
we need is not to find what is wrong
with us but rather to see that we
share our weaknesses with other
people. ...This sounds like an old
recipe preached for the first fifty
years. But let me explain myself.

I do not believe in the idea that
everyone can and has to help him-
self. We cannot tell people to ask the
ultimate question if there is no an-
swer. What we search for is a mean-
ing in and for life. The traditional
solution is to focus our struggle on
the distant end when we pass into
another world. Today, when the old
religion is losing its grip on us, we
ask for a meaning now, not then, But
what is there to live for? Anne Jones
suggests we have to search ourselves
to find the answer because “we are
all in the end alone.”—No! We are
not.

We must not accept the notion that
we face the most important prob-
lems of life alone. After all, we all
share the same old universe. The old
argument that all of us face death
alone, for example, is totally irrele-
vant. As I see it, death is the least
important occasion in life. We should
not concentrate our struggle on the
evening of our own life, but rather
on the morning of other’s. We are all
members of the community of man-
kind and this is what we have to
live for...not through giving our
citizens better cars, but by partici-
pating in life.

The idea of the individual creat-

/ing himself is absurd. As it has been

said: “People need people to be peo-

ple.” We will not find the answer

in our selves but in our fellow men.

What we lack is enthusiasm and in-

A “warning” may be issued, which
is nothing more than just that—a
warning. “Conduct Probation” is for
a specific length of time but does not
infringe upon the student's social life
in any manner. It merely warns the
student that he had better watch

might ensue. “Social Probation” pro-
hibits the individual from being on
the premises of his own fraternity
for any reason whatsoever for a

however, prohibt the individual from

other seventeen fraternities. “Com-

The most severe action the Com-

to the Faculty Administration Com-

Phi of last March 12th; and, assum-
ing that he is serious and that he is
not just attempting to be an amateur
iconoclast, 1 find his attitude rather
difficult to understand, especially in
view of the fact that he has lived
with the Honor System for nearly
four years and thus far has managed
to get along with this Olympian
“deity.”

Mr. Harrington has gone entirely
too far in labelling as “heinous un-
truth” the proposition “that intel-
lectuality is not the cardinal test of
a college's worth.” If there is one les-
son which history (particulary intel-
lectual history) makes thoroughly
clear, it is that the human intellect
is incapable of ensuring rectitude in
human conduct.

The desideratum, then, is not an
Honor System which is simply “a
footnote to, an enhancement of, an
added asset of, the Washington and
Lee Community,” however splendid
the community may be. If the Honor
System is worth anything, if it is
fit to be a “system” or a “structural
method” at all, if it is not to degen-
erate into a joke, it must continue to
invade and pervade and, in fact,
deepen all the necessary intellectual-
ity which exists at Washington and
Lee and without which, as Mr. Har-
rington has pointed out, the college
would certainly fail in her intellee-
tual commitment

I should hope that it will be ad
mitted that a scholar whose learning
is informed with honor will neces-
sarily be a better scholar by the
very way in which he possesses and
handles his learning. For one thing
as compared with statements of the
mere servant (who, as some are
may be dishonest), the statements
which the honorable
intellectual will have to say and

crupulously

write ean at least be depended upon

In any case, the lectures and pub-
lieations of the careful and honorable
scholar ‘the Washington and Le
type) will naturally have a more en-
during value. And I offer this as one
conerete (non-sentimental) reason
why there are those of use who cher-

Bridgewater Gives
W&L Its Latest Loss

By LOCK HANDLEY
W&L baseball coach Joe Lyles believes that every team has

one game coming to it each seas
right.

on in which it can’t do anything

Coach Lyles’ squad played theirs Wednesday.

The Generals lost to Bridgewater Co
on paper, by a 16-1 score. W&L com-* —

mitted 11 errors, walked 11 men, and!
committed innumerable judgement |
errors, wild pitches, and passed balls.
On the offense, the team got seven
hits, once loaded the bases with no-
body out, but scored their lone run
on three walks and an error.

Starting pitcher Jim Cooper, who
was fairly effective despite being
charged with the loss, gave up one
run on a pair of singles and an in-
field error in the first inning. In the
General half of the frame, Eric Sis-
ler singled, Dave Kirkpatrick was
safe on a fielder’s choice, and Skip
Chase came up with another single
to fill the basses; but all three died
there, and that was as close as W&L
came to being in the contest. The
Generals kept making errors and
the Eagles kept piling up runs off
Cooper and relief man Pete Heu-
mann, Terry Herman, and Bill Ras-
mussen.

Wednesday’s loss was the sixth
straight for the horsehiders, as they
lost all five games on their spring
trip. The first defeat was at the
hands of Elon College by a 3-1 score.
Errors told the story once again as
the winning runs, off reliefer Heu-
mann, came on only one hit. The
General run also came on an error
after Skip Chase singled and Tom
Crenshay walked in the fifth inning.

W&L then moved on to Fort Bragg
for a three-game series. In the first
game with the service team, the
Generals came up with their highest
run total so far, but were outgunned
and lost 9-4. The next day, a fine
performance by pitcher Cooper went
to no avail as Wally Malphrus pitch-
ed a no-hit no-run game to blank
W&L, 2-0.

In the final Fort Bragg game, start-
er Bill Rasmussen was pounded for
eleven runs in the first inning as
sixteen men came to the plate. Terry
Hermann, who finished the game on
the mound, got the only General hit
as the horsehiders were shut out
again, 17-0.

The final stop on the trip was at
Frederick College. Here another
good pitching performance, a five-
hitter by Chris Wigert, was nulli-
fied by errors and weak hitting as
the Generals lost 5-1. Tom Cren-
shaw drove in the lone W&L run.

The Generals travel to Lynchburg
College tomorrow for a 3 p.m. game,
with Wigert expected to start. Next
home game for the team is set for

Doremus Gym Was

Once Considered
“Finest in the South”

By GUY UNANGST
Friday Sportswriter

With plans for a new field house

in the making, and Washington and|

Lee University undergoing its first
“self-study,” the critical eye has

And to think it was once lauded as
“the finest gym in the south,” even
if it was W&L which did the laud-
ing.

That was back in 1914, when Mrs.
Jessie R. Doremus’ gift of the build-
ing was announced. It was to have
“a massive swimming pool, an ade-
quate indoor running track, and
ample seating space.” All that and
handball courts too.

It was modeled after the gym at
Princeton, constructed in the colon-
ial style and cost $100,000. The archi-
techt was Benjamin C. Flournoy,
class of 1897, and it opened January
4, 1914. It was then that the school’s
first compulsory physical education
classes were held.

The gym’s floor is the original, 50
years old after surviving mock cor -
ventions, dances, and ROTC drills
in addition to athletic events. The
first athletic event there was a
basketball game between Fishburne
Military School and Randolph-Macon
Academy. Fishburne won, 17-13. It
was built in memory of Robert Park-
er Doremus, financier and yachtsman
who left the school $1,903,000. W&L’s
largest single endowment now, his
bequest has a market value of more
than two million dollars.

Legend has it that Doremus, while
vacationing in Hot Springs, probably
in 1912, visited the campus and was
so impressed with the courtesy of
a student who showed him aro id
that he gave W&L his entire for-
tune. Maybe he had that rich look

ing an admirable handlebar mous-
tache.

Lacrosse Team Loses to Ohio State;

 

NHU, Hartwick Next General Foes _

With a record of 0-1, the Wash-
ington and Lee lacrosse team will go
after its first two wins of the sea-
son this weekend in games here.

The Generals take on the Univer-
sity of New Hampshire this afternoon
in a game at 3:15. Then tomorrow
afternoon the Generals will face
Hartwick College in a 2:30 game.

The Generals opened the season
with a 7-6 loss to Ohio State right
before spring vacation. The game
went into overtime before the Buck-
eyes were able to come out on top.

The game was well-played in spite
of being held on a very muddy field,
in what Coach Dana Swan described
as “deplorable conditions.” The Gen-
erals had a 6-5 lead going into the
final minute of play, but Ohio State
scored the tying goal with just 49
seconds left.

The Generals had possession of
the ball for much of the game, top-
ping the Ohio club 63-46 in ground
balls and 11-5 in face offs. Pat Rob-

In this special 64-page supplement
in the April issue of Harper's Maga-
zine, 14 distinguished writers discuss
the delicate relationships between
South and North, between Southern
white and Negro; the moods and
fears of the Southern people; the
changing faces of the land and its
cities.

Together, they have placed the last
century in historical perspective,
and created a portrait in depth of
the South today that will surprise
and inform every American.

Contributors include Southern his-
torian C. Vann Woodward, who
shows how the North helped but-
tress and condone racial seerega-
tion: James J. Kilpatrick, conserva-
tive editor of the Richmond News
Leader, who believes that the South
will solve its racial problems quicker
and with greater maturity than the
North: Negro author Louis E. Lo-
max observing the changes in both
races in his home town of Valdosta,
Georgia: Fonathan Daniels, editor of
the Raleigh News & Observer, dem-
onstrating how Southern industrial
growth continues to make victims of
its people; child psychiatrist Robert
Coles investigating the human im-
pact of school desegregation

Among the other contributors are
novelist William Styron, British his-
torilan D, W. Brogan, novelist
Walker Percy, Whitney M. Young,

ertson alone was responsible for 19
of the ground balls.

General goals were scored by |
Jackson, Pittman, Bowersox, Daes-|
ner, Michaels, and Robertson. Assists
were turned in by Michaeles, Robert-|
son, Klinglehofer, and Ostroff.

The big problem for the Generals
was they didn’t take enough shots.
They took just 26 in the game. As
a result Coach Swan had the Gen-
erals working on offense in practice
this last week. He said, you really
need about 50 shots per game to do
well.”

Ohio State is rated as one of the
top teams in the country. They're
listed as the team to beat this year |
in the Midwest Lacrosse Federation. |

Looking ahead to this weekend's
games, the one this afternoon against
New Hampshire rates as a real tough
one. The team is described as big and
aggressive,

Tennis Team
Opens Season

With 9-0 Win

From the results of their first game,
it looks like the General tennis team
could be headed for a good season.

Wednesday the Generals opened
the season with a 9-0 victory over
Bridgewater in a match there. And
the top three General racketmen
didn’t even play.

Sweep Singles Matches

Forrest Dickinson opened the af-
ternoon for the Generals with a 6-2,
6-1 victory over Tom Scordaas. Phil
Thompson took the next match, beat-
ing Andy Hayes 8-6, 6-2. Howard
Busse then added a victory over
Kirk Stokes by 6-1, 6-3. Other vic-
tories were taken by Fred Webb over
Eddie Higgs, 6-1, 6-1; Dick Bradford
over Gordon White, 6-2, 6-0; and
Dick Crook over Jay LaViolette,
6-0, 6-0.

The Generals also swept all three
double matches with the team of
Dickinson and Thompson beating
the team of Scordaas and Hayes,
6-2, 6-2. The team of Busse and
Webb then added a 6-0, 6-1 victory
over Bridgewater’s team of Stokes
and Higgs. The final General victory
was picked up by the team of Steve
Case and Torrey Armstrong over
White and LaViolette of Bridgewater
by scores of 6-0, 6-1.

Face Hampden-Sydney Next

The next game will pit the Gen-
erals against Hampden-Sydney
here a week from today at 3:15. This
should be a good match as Hamp-
den-Sydney opened the season with
a 9-0 win over Lynchburg. The Gen-
erals are expected to be in top shape
for the game. Coach Canfield de-
clined to predict a winner, saying
it should be a close match.

‘We Must Be Honest Alone’

(Continued from page 2)

And the beauty and the wonder
of it is that by fighting this “un-
easy fear’ we can create ourselves
in the refusal to continue to let
ourselves, all unaware be created.
As Gibran has said,

“You shall be free indeed when
your days are not without a care
nor your nights without a want and
grief,

But rather when these things girdle
your life and yet you rise above
them naked and unbound.

And how shall you rise beyond
your days and nights unless you
break the chains which you at the
dawn of your understanding have
fastened about your noon hour?”

This answer to the question
“Where lies the problem.” is by its
nature tentative and uncertain. My
purpose in writing is to ask a ques-
tion more than to offer an answer
or a solution: Is what I have said
meaningful to you? Do you think
part of the problem lies here? It
is in your answers and in the dia-
logue which might result, among all
of us, the younger students, who pay
to be here and the older students
who are paid, that we can begin to
learn, to grow, to have an “intellec-
tual climate” at Hollins. We are all,
in the end, alone, and we must be
honest alone. Yet the attempt to
communicate and in so doing to open
ourselves to the risk of rejection,
or the joy of human love, is essen-
tial to the process of becoming alive.

So we can still wear our McMul-
lens, listen to Beethoven, read Candy,
get high, rollerskate around front
quad, scream, cry, laugh—for these
things in themselves are neither
good nor bad. What matters is why.
This I do believe, for the time be-
ing.

terest, interest in the life of others.
The despair of man is not the result
of a fruitless search for the basi:
values in himself, but rather the re-
sult of a lack of understanding.

“There is a light at the horizon
that I don’t see

There is a voice in the darkness
that I don’t hear

There is someone somewhere
..- 1 don’t understand.”

Our problem is not that we are
alone, but that we think we are.
We cannot see that we are surround-
ed by people and life, and that we
are a part of it. But how are we

they get here. Yesterday they played
Duke, and the day before North
Carolina.

The Generals are in pretty gbood
shape for the games although two
players have complained of back in-
juries. The big trouble for the Gen-
erals remains offense. Coach Swan
expressed the belief that this last
week’s practice had helped clear up
that problem.

The Generals’ game against Hofs-
tra, which was cancelled because of
rain and muddy fields, on March 27,
has been rescheduled for April 28.

search ourselves we do not find any
answer. The solution might be par-
ticipation in life, in our own as well
as in others’. When I say we lack
enthusiasm and interest, I do not
mean enthusiasm “a la” P.T.A. but
rather that of a general “I want” and
“T can.”

I think there are two main ideas
with which we have all been indoc-
trinated and which make for our
despair: the idea “the basic values
which are to be found through
knowing yourself,” and “the theory
of the overall ranging importance of
death as a time when our life is
being judged.”

...Perhaps we all have to cre-
ate the values by Living together.

... Perhaps we need other people
in order to understand ourselves

... Perhaps the idea of life is Life
and not death.

If this is so, we must not, through
isolation, kill each other.
