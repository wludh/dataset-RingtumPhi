The above policy changes were

The Executive Committee believes
that the great majority of students
wish to live under the conventional

the Assimilation Committee as it

James DeYoung Receives

Frank J.

James DeYoung, Phi Kap senior
from Kenilworth, Illinois, received
the Frank J. Gilliam Award Wed-|
nesday night as graduating seniors,
members of the Alumni Association,
feculty, and guests filled Evans Din-|
ing Hall for the 26th annual Senior
Banquet.

The award was established in 1963)
by the Executive Committee in hon-
or of retiring Dean Frank J. Gilliam.
t is given annually to the graduat-
ing senior who, in the opinion of the!
committee, has made the most out-|
standing contributions to Washing-|
ton and Lee, and who exhibits most!
closely the principles and dedication
that characterized Dean Géilliam’s
career with the unversity.

In making the presentation ad-
dress President Cole pointed out that
the selection is made completely
without regard to a candidate’s po-
litical record on campus, and that
it is not necessary to have held any
particular office or belonged to any
particular organizations.

He paid tribute, however, to De
Young’s wide variety of interests as
reflected in his record of extracur-
ricular actiivties, which include
membership in ODK, Pi Sigma
Alpha honorary political science fra-
ternity, and Beta Gamma Sigma
honorary commerce school fraternity.
He has also served as president of
Phi Kappa Sigma, captain of the
varsity tennis team, business man-
ager of the Southern Collegian, and
a member of the Student Service
Society and Student War Memorial
Scholarship Fund Committee.

In reply, DeYoung said: “I am
deeply honored in receiving this
award. But I am also mindful of
the splendid cooperation of many
others. With humbleness I say,
‘Thank you very much’.”

The winner of the award receives
$100 outright and an additional $150

ideals of the past American presi-
dents Woodrow Wilson and John F.
Kennedy, both of whom advocated
the preparation of a world society
“with a place for divergency.” Thus
the white government of South Af-
rica is dedicated toward the preser-
vation of the white culture located in
the vicinity of the Cape area. And
to accomplish this the government is
enforcing a program of “vertical de-
velopment” which will theoretically
allow each culture to develop to its
highest potential without contami-
nating others.

In this light, Mr. Winsled went on
to say, it is unreasonable for the
world to expect such policies as in-
tegration or universal suffrage to be
embraced by South Africa. For, al-
though existing international opinion
frowns on the idea of one sociologi-
eal group dominating another, no
other course of action would be feas-
ible in a society whose economy is
run and directed by a white popu-
lace which finds itself outnumbered
five to one. If, Mr. Winsled contin-
ued, South Africa believed that it

of the white culture, it}

For Next Year

At a meeting of fraternity presi-
dents and rush chairmen last night,
several changes in procedure for
Rush Week next fall were made, with
minor wording changes in the Inter-
fraternity Council constitution also

accepted.
In place of three of the six Open
Houses scheduled for Monday of

Rush Week, two “Open Rush Dates”
will be held in the afternoon. These
“Open Rush Dates” will be much
like Open Houses, except that beer
may be served, and each will last
ifor an hour and fifteen minutes.
| Their purpose is to give freshmen
who are not satisfied with or not
asked back to the fraternities they
saw on previous Open Houses a
chance to see at least one other.
Each fraternity is required to hold
jone “Open Rush Date”, with the
second being optional.

Another rush change will add a
third hour of Open Dorm Rush, to
be held on Sunday of Rush Week
from 12:55 to 1:55. Open Dorm Rush

The Eternal Juke

Ten pledges stand before the hypnotic
monster which emits jarring shrieks. The
shrieks of the Machine are matched only by
those of the hypnotized.

“Juke! Juke! Juke!”

“Through its emphasis in the liberal arts
and sciences, Washington and Lee’s curricu-
lum tends to involve studies that free the
mind, lead to understanding, create humility
and tolerance, and afford a basis for continu-
ing study and learning.” — Washington and
Lee catalogue, page 14.

A strange yet true syllogism emerges some-
what like this: Socialism is considered a liberal
tendency. Wé&L is considered a conservative
school. Yet W&L is socialistic in the worst
connotation of that term.

Social Initiative

“No one attends the University who does
not become aware of new dimensions of gen-
tlemanly conduct and honor whose traditions
stem from when General Robert E. Lee was
president of the institution.”” — Washington
and Lee catalogue, page 15.

W&L is a killer of initiative.

First, W&L is a killer of social initiative.
One wonders what the W&L man did before
the combo party and bourbon. One wonders
how the self-perpetuating social animal could
ever have been otherwise than it is now. Our
mores, values and social ethics were defined
for us long before we entered as freshmen.
Freshman camp was the indoctrinary starting-
point of a long assembly-line complete with
the Osmotic Committee, Jack Daniels, and a
Playboy sexual attitude which is representa-
tive of our consideration and treatment of
other people and things.

The freshman sees the sophomore and
molds himself after the upperclassman. That
current sophomore saw this year’s junior last
year, who in turn saw the sophomore before
him, now a senior. And so the perpetual mo-
tion Machine reproduces itself in a giant self-
carnivorous circle. The fact that this circle
cannot, or at least has not, liberated itself, is
a proof of our lack of social and ethical ini-
tiative.

We live in a James Bond world at W&L.
We have no open values or enthusiasms other
than sex, booze and non-involvement. James
Bond attains the level of a god. We may
laugh at his exaggerated sophisticate values,
but we will return from the movie to emulate
them. Just as in Bond movies, it is the image
that is important, the image of a hollow, self-
conscious “individual.” Just as Bond is self-
consciously aware of his image, we too are
concerned in projecting the social impression.

If you do not believe it, consider the pride
you take in preparing for a quiz with less ef.-
fort and time than your classmates. We lack
spontaneity, initiative, drive. We even get
drunk in a self-conscious way. The image is
ever before us, and we preserve the image.
We are afraid to criticize, to analyze, to ques-
tion. We are afraid to break out of the social
mold that has come to dominate W&L life.

The reason we consider the social first is
because this is the essence, the hub around
which everything else revolves. Many of the
social aspects are not inherently evil, but in
the conformity in which their uniformity ex-
presses itself, they crowd out and overshadow
more important considerations and responsi-
bilities.

Intellectual Responsibility

ef

in the course of four years he is
confronted with much basic knowledge that is
of inestimable value, no matter what his ulti-
mate role in society may be. But he also im-
proves his ability to think — deliberately, crit-
ically, and analytically. He develops new
powers of reasoning that enable him to arrive
at sound, defensible conclusions. He learns
where to seek answers to questions and prob.
lems. And through it all, he is drawn ‘into
fuller and deeper life,’ the good college en-
gendering in him ‘processes of learning’ that
are continued throughout his lifetime’ —
Washington and Lee catalogue, page 15.
Perhaps the first of these is the intellec-
tual. We are ashamed of working hard and
therefore doing well. We are not ashamed of

working superficially and doing well. In our
world the “pursuit of learning’’ lacks integ-
rity. If anything, we pay mere lip-service to
the intellectual. Our social syndrome is partly
the culprit here, but neither is the classroom
exempt from criticism. We are not allowed to
immerse ourselves in personally valid educa-
tion. Instead, we are given lists to memorize
and facts to be regurgitated. We are not given
responsibility to learn for and by ourselves
with the guidance of a professor. Because we
do not have this responsibility and because
memorization leaves little time for reflection
and pursuing personal curiosity, our sense of
intellectual responsibility withers. Our leth-
argy is a cause of our professors frustrations,
but their methods are, conversely, the causes
of our lethargy. We the students, and more
importantly, the administration, refuse to ques-
tion our faculty. Our faculty refuses to de-
mand a personal learning for fear of losing
their sacred lists in advocating the philosophy
of “no think.”

And what do we return to? The same
cancerous cycle, not the progress of a straight
line. If we are not given the responsibility, we |

lackadaisically accept the lack of responsibility, || R

we slip into a socialistic world devoid of intel-
lectual initiative.

Religious Non-Involvement

“The second ‘enduring adherence’ of the
University is its dedication to the Christian
Ideal.” —- Washington and Lee catalogue,
page 16.

The third area, so much less in vogue
than the social or even the intellectual, is the
religious. Fully aware that the rest of this
paragraph will go unread, we hold that this,
itself, is the most striking example of our un-
willingness to examine, to step out of the
norm, to consider something more important
than the latest flick. Many of us may priv-
ately hold beliefs, but because we are afraid
of social ostracization, we discount, or hold,
these beliefs in shame. We have put the
purely social above religious conviction.

It is fashionable, intellectually and otherwise,
to believe that God is dead. We demand a
tangible proof which is in itself evident that
we understand little of subjective matters,
much less faith. We label each other “lizards”
if we maintain a belief, simply because relig-
ious conviction is held to be powerless and
unsophisticated. Someone once said, “For
I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ for
it is the power of God unto salvation to every-
one who believes.”

Who among us will maintain that we do
not need salvation, if “only” from ourselves?
Institutional Pride

We show wide-spread stagnation in our
institutional pride. We have moved in to a
cocoon of self-centered existence and fear
showing any pride and allegiance to our Uni-
versity. In continually damning our institution
and its leaders, we fail to present any alterna-
tives to our present situation. We fail in two
respects. First, little or no thought is integrat-
ed into ideas we may have; and, secondly, if
our basic premises are sound we lack the
initiative and drive to stand up for what is
tight. Those who do possess this quality are
immediately labeled as true self-centered ego-
tists who are out for themselves. Consequent-
ly, progress in the true sense of the word is
forced from our minds, whether we wish to
admit it or not.

A student at W&L has two responsibili-
ties. He has a responsibility to himself to gain
the best education possible; more importantly,
however, he has a responsibility to the Uni-
versity.

A university can be no better than the peo-
ple who inhabit its academic environment.
Therefore, if W&L is to ever become a
“Great’ institution, it will require the efforts
of its students, faculty and administration.

Ten seniors stood before the provincial
god of lack of initiative. Ten seniors bowed
down to social conformity, intellectual stulti-
fication, and religious unconcern. Ten sen-
iors refused to analyze, to question, to be in-
volved. Ten seniors shrieked, “W&L! W&L!

 

Professor Publishes Rat Results

 

Dr. Jarrard Studies Rat Brain Damage

A Washington and Lee professor
and one hundred fifty rats are the
principals in a series of experiments
being conducted in duPont Hall, in
an attempt to determine how brain
functions control behavior patterns
in animals and in man. Dr. Leon-
ard E. Jarrard, professor of psy-
chology, discussing his research ear-
lier this week, commented that while
all work done thus far has been
“strictly experimental”, the results
have been encouraging, and that
continued experimentation should
significantly increase our knowledge
in the field of neuro-psychology.

For the past three years, Dr. Jar-
rard and several Robert E. Lee Re-
search Scholars have been testing
the effects of various types of brain
damage on the rats, with recent em-
phasis on the hippocampus, a rela-
tively small brain area, centrally lo-
cated, and of uncertain functions.
These experiments, Dr. Jarrard
noted, have apparently discredited

 

one theory that the hippocampus
controls short term memory; his re-
search has shown that it seems to
influence several different types of
functions.

This spring, experiments have been
conducted using an unusually com-
plex apparatus called “Operant Con-
ditioning Equipment”, which releas-
es food pellets to the rats at ran-
dom times as the rats press bars
in their cages. Not each press will
release a pellet; the rats must learn
to keep pressing the bar. The learn-
ing times of normal control rats
are compared with those for rats
with brain damage resulting from
the administration of drugs and from
removal of various parts.

Other work has concerned “taste
threshholds.” The rats are placed in
cages containing identical dishes,
one of water and the other of water
mixed with quinine. As the rats
learn to avoid the bitter quinine, it

 

 

is further diluted, to the point where

they are unable to notice the taste.
Again, the “taste threshholds” of
control rats are compared with those
for the injured rats.

Records are kept of the effects of
brain damage on the basic, “instinc-
tive” body functions of the animals.
They are observed day and night,
and times spent on every activity
are noted,

These experiments have been
sponsored under the National Sci-
ence Foundation Undergraduate Re-
search Participation Program. On
leave next year, Dr. Jarrard will
continue his research at the Univer-
sity of Florida College of Medicine,
under a National Institute of Health
Special Fellowship. Florida’s school
of medicine, noted for its neuro-
anatomy-physiology programs, is the
center in the South for epilepsy pa-
tients and conducts extensive brain
surgery; Dr. Jarrard plans to check
his theories at the human level there.
He pointed out that while animal
experimentation is a necessary start-
ing-point in such research, results
cannot always be generalized to a
human level, and that next year’s
study will therefore be essential.

A graduate of Carnegie Institute of
Technology in Pittsburgh, Dr. Jar-
rard has long believed in the use-
fulness of student participation in
research. When he came to W&L in
1959, he was engaged in research on
the effflects of radiation on animals.
He recalled that at first, his research
“was not too popular.” Now he has
more applications for research as-
sistantships than he can use. This
year, he has been aided by Robert
E. Lee, Ill, Ken Marion, Ralph O’-
Connor, and Andy Smith. Remain-
ing at W&L this summer to continue
work with the rats will be Smith,
Roger Sphar, and C. B. Manning.
Dr. Jarrard feels that such student
research invaluable in showing
students all that is involved in the
study of one small area of psychol-
ogy.

Preliminary results of Dr. Jar-
rard’s research have been published
in numerous American and interna-
tional journals of psychology. Earlier
this year, he delivered papers at
meetings in Atlanta and Chicago.
Each of his students, last week, gave

Stickmen End Season

 

In Loss To Virginia

By KIP ARMSTRONG
The varsity lacrosse team ended
its season Wednesday with an out-
standing losing effort against arch-

rival Virginia on Wilson Field. The}

final score was 12-7.

The seniors on the team — tri-
captains Michaeles, Pat Robertson,
and Klingelhofer, goalies Morgan

and West, and middie Jackson (who
will play next year as a law stu-
dent) all climaxed fine lacrosse ca-
reers at W&L with outstanding con-
tributions in their final game as Gen-
erals. It was evident throughout the
game that the Generals had their
hearts in this one — they wanted
a win badly — and as Coach Swan
said, “They almost pulled it off.”
The Generals opened the scoring
with two minutes .gone as Frost
found Klingelhofer open, and Car-
roll fired it by Brandt. The Virginia
team stung back a minute later, as
mid-fielder Stewart tallied two goals,
and the Wahoos added two more to
give them a 4-1 quarter lead. The
game was closer in the second pe-
riod, as the Blue traded goals with
the vistiors until late in the period,

final goals to bring the margin to
12-7 when the gun sounded.

The conditioning and speed of the
small General team was clearly evi-

Dickinson Named Next
Year’s Tennis Captain

George Forrest Dickinson, a junior
from Loretto, Virginia, has been se~-
lected tennis captain for the 1965-66
school year. The action came this
week after this year’s squad closed
jout the season Tuesday with a 6-3
| victory over Randolph-Macon.
| For Dickinson, a member of Phi
Kappa Sigma, this was his third year
|on the tennis squad. For most of
the season he played number three
singles, but for the last match
against Randolph-Macon he played
number two singles behind Jim De
Young. Dickinson also played on the
doubles team.

Commenting on his selection as
captain, Coach Verne Canfield ex-
pressed the belief that Dickinson

 

“will make a very good captain.”

when McGill put Virginia ahead 8-4. ;

Bruce Jackson scored on an extra-
man play, and Klingelhofer and
Daesener got the other
goals in the second quarter.
Bowersox, who played his finest

game of the season, controlled the

opening face-off of the second half,
and the stickmen scored quickly on
a goal by Pittman. Michaeles cut
the margin to two with a_ well-
placed shot at 2:04 of the third quar-
ter. Virginia stormed back to lead
my three.

Klingelhofer tallied the final goal
on a fantastic shot in the upper left
hand corner one inch from the edge
of the net. At 7:40, Prusmack of
U.Va. was given a two mintue rest
when he swung at Billy Andrews in
retaliation for a beautiful block. In
the final quarter Virginia tallied its

Netters Defeat

Washington and Lee’s varsity ten-
nis squad closed out its 1965 season
Tuesday afternoon with a 6-3 vic-
tory over the Randolph-Macon net-
ters.

The General victory was primarily
a result of the squad’s superb dou-
bles play, with W&lL sweeping all
three doubles matches after breaking
even in six singles matches.

Victories in singles play were
picked up by Lindsey Short over
Scott Hanson, 6-3, 6-3; by Phil
Thompson over Tom Hodges, 6-3,
8-6; and by Fred Webb over Len
Harper, 7-5, 6-1. Jim DeYoung lost
his singles match to Monroe Baisden,
6-1, 2-6, 9-7. Other defeats for W&L
came when John Wolff downed For-
rest Dickinson, 6-2, 5-7, 6-3, and
when Ed Kellogg picked up a win
over Howard Busse, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4.

In the doubles competition, the
team of Short and Dickinson defeat-
ed Baisden and Hanson, 7-5, 6-1
DeYoung and Thompson then
teamed up for a 6-3, 6-1 victory over
Wolff and Hodges. Webb and Dick
Crook won the final doubles match
over Turner and Kellogg, 6-2, 6-3.

With the victory over Randolph-
Macon the Generals ran their ree-
ord to 5-1 in dual meets. They were
0-3 in the tournament competition

so the final overall record for W&L
is 5-4,

Coach Verne Canfield, after the
final game, said it was an odd sea-
son. He pointed out the Generals
went from comparatively easy
matches like the ones against Bridge-
water and Lynchburg, to real tough
competition in the Cherry Blossom
Tournament. On the whole, he felt
the team had a pretty good season.

Looking ahead to next year, Can-
field
team which compiled a 4-2 record
this year. Particularly outstanding
on the frosh squad was Wick Vell-
ines, although Canfield added there
were about ten on the squad who
all played good ball.

Canfield also said that the num-
ber two high school player in the
state of Virginia has enrolled at
Washington and Lee for next year.
He is Tom Rueger of Virginia Beach.
Canfield said he should be able to
make the varsity squad.

Three letter winners will be back
from this year’s squad. They are
captain-elect Forrest Dickinson, Phil
Thompson, and Dick Crook. Can-
field added that they should provide
the nucleus for a good team next
season.

Basketball Chances Improve
As 33 Prep Players Enroll

the person, who, in the opinion of |

Head basketball coach Verne Can-
field is a happy man these days.
This is highly unusual for a coach
whose teams dropped seventeen of
nineteen starts last season. But Can-
field has 33 good reasons for optim-
ism hanging on the bulletin board in
his office. On 3 by 5 index cards,
he has recorded the names, heights,
weights, positions and College Board
scores of 33 topnotch freshmen who
have confirmed acceptance at W&L
for next year.

Coach Canfield has attracted the
33 by means of fifteen trips through
nine states, a weekly newsletter, and
over 1,000 personal letters and tele-
grams.

“All the boys with whom I talked

play just about every game this
year and was very impressed with
his rebounding ability. In the Dis-
trict tournament, Earl pulled down
84 rebounds in three games.”

Others with a good shot at making
the varsity are 6-4 Rick Lohrman
from Webster, New York, Rob
Bauer, 6-1, from Pensacola, Florida,
and 6-2 Jim Philpott of Lexington,
North Carolina. All three have won
All-Conference or All-District hon-
ors this last year.

were very serious about their edu-
cation,” he says. “I had very little|
trouble selling them W&L on this|
point.” |
“I also told them that they would
be taking part in an extensive bas-
ketball improvement program while
working on their education. I men-
tioned that there would be three
coaches working with them next
year and that we would have an im-
proved and more practical schedule
including a December trip to Flor-
ida.”

“T told them that in years to come
we will include more games and
tournaments in out-of-state areas
such as Kentucky, Tennessee, and
Connecticut.”

Next year’s prospects come from
16 states. 23 of them are over the
six-foot level, with size ranging
from 6-5, 200 pound Earl Edwards
of Lexington down to Gil Fitzhugh
of McLean at 5-8 and 150 pounds.
College Board scores average out to
587 verbal and 627 in math.

Asked if 33 freshmen would be
too many, Canfield said that some of
the prospects had a chance to play
with the varsity next year to fill the

 

lacrosse team ended the season Mon-
day with a 9-5 loss to the University
of Virginia.

The Baby Generals held a 2-1 lead
after one quarter, but the Cavaliers
stormed back in the second period to
take the lead 5-3.

Washington and Lee’s goals were
scored by Dave Johnson, Kester
Denman, Lars Holtan and Cris
Hart. Hart scored two.

The Generals finished the season
with a 2-6 record, but according to
coach Bob Van Rensselaer the team
was just beginning to come along.

Van Rensselaer said that the last
two games were the best because the
team finally started to click on of-
fense. “Offense only comes with ex-
perienced stick handlers and the last
two games showed vast improve-
ment,” stated the coach.

Cris Hart lead the freshman team
in goals for the year with 14. Griffin
lead in assists, while Harold Stowe
and Bruce Commander received par-
ticular praise for good, consistent
defense throughout the season. Van

we want Conventional Dress, and,
if so, do we want it backed up by
an Assimilation Committee. You see,
the ultimate decision lies with us. If
we decide to allow each student to
dress according to his own taste,
then that decision is final — the fac-
ulty ean do nothing about it. Brown
underestimates the power of the stu-
dent body and the interest that can
aroused in them concerning cru-
cial issues. What does he think we
are — a mass of warm bodies just
ready to accept whatever the faculty
hands down? Be serious, man;
there’s more to us than that. Inci-
dentally, if students here were to
become genuinely interested in the
academic side of the university, then
their interest in the University as a
whole would be enhanced. There-
fore, they could easily be incited
to take issue with the faculty if the
latter were to hand down a decision
such as the one Brown indicates
they're currently considering. (1
wonder if this is what the faculty
fears by considering taking student
dress into their hands). So I guess
Brown loses out on all sides.

“Open Rush?”

To the Ring-tum Phi:

It's come to our attention that the
LF.C. is continuing its policy of
publishing two separate lists of in-
coming freshmen — one Jewish, the
other Christian. Why should this
be necessary? How can the LF.C.
sanction an open rush program and
at the same time negate the possibil-
ity of accomplishing this? Is not the
LF.C. simply condoning the perpetu-
ation of an intolerably hypocritical
and prejudicial system of discrimina-
tion, whose ultimate purpose is the
obvious exclusion of an otherwise
anonymous group from membership
in the vast majority of fraternities?

We feel that Washington and Lee

Winsled Clarifies Apartheid

(Continued from page 1)

Winsled called attention to the suc-
cess of vertical development in oth-
er historical instances — notably, the
political policy of modern Switzer-
land and the economic structure of
the German Zollverein prior to 1871.

In closing, Mr. Winsled reiterated
the rights of the white culture to
preserve itself and ended by stating
that South Africa will not knuckle
under to the pressure of world opin-
ion as long as apartheid continues to
be as successful as it is today.

A lively question-and-answer pe-
riod followed, in which the follow-
ing answers were given to random
queries from the audience. “No,

there is no ‘psychosis of fear’ behind |

the enforcement of apartheid.” “The
independent states of the Confeder-
ation will not accept Communist aid

because the Communists cannot
match the 30% of the tax dollar
which South Africa puts into the
development of the states.” “The
United States will not boycott South
Africa because it would be economi-
cally unfeasible” (it appears that
South Africa is the leading producer
of platinum, a metal required in
much space-age production). “No,
there is no anthropological reason
for apartheid. The coloured races
are equally as adept at working in
a mechanized society as the white
man, if not more so, because of his
willingness to learn.”
