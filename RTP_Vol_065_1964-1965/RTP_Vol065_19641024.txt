Freshman EC Election Rescheduled F

Troubadour’s First Play

Is “Merchant of Venice’

In observance of the four hun-
dredth anniversary of William
Shakespeare’s birth, the Trouba-

dours from Nov. 18-21 will present
the Shakesperian play, The Mer-
chant of Venice. The play is per-
formed by W&L students and facul-
ty and produced and directed by Dr.
C. O. Jones.

In the starring starring role, Lew
Davis will portray Shylock, a Jewish
usurer and the villian of the play.
Antonio, the merchant of Venice,
will be played by Peter Stelling. In
other leading men’s roles Charles
Bright will play Bassanio, Mare
Rehr, Gratiano and Jeff Williams,
Lorenzo.

In major supporting roles Tom
Holden will take the part of Salerio;
Steve Millard, Salanio. Sid Parham,
Ward Briggs, and Gay Reading will
take the roles of Prince Morocco,
Prince of Argon, and Duke of Ven-
ice respectively. The acting exper-
ience of Bright and Reading dates
from Dr. Faustus last year back
to Othello four years ago.

Lockhart Handley and Jay Hight
will take the low comedy parts of
Launcelot and Old Gobbo. Handley
had experience last year as Andro-
cles while Height has also had two
years experience in comedy. As Dr.
Jones aply asserted, “Dr. Shilling-
ton will have his annual appearance
in a part which will show his ample
acting ability.” Dr. Shillington will
portray Tubal, a rich Jew friend of
Shylock.

Filling a variety of roles as ser-
vants, attendants, and officials are
Tim Webster, Paul Cheever, Jim
Settle, John Crigler, Roger Clarke,
Don Raybold, Evan Jeffries, and
Jay Cady.

Mrs. Martha Evans, wife of Pro-

 

fessor John Evans of the English
department, will star as Portia. Al-
though Mrs. Evans will appear for
her first time on the stage at
W&L, she has had previous acting
experience elsewhere. Kendall Jam-
ison, a senior at Lexington High
School, will portray Nerissa while
Joan Parham will take the role of
Jessica.
Plot Summary

The rich, fair, and wise lady Por-
tia of Belmont has many suitors, one
of whom is Bassanio, a penniless,
attractive, young Venetian gentle-
man. In order to court Portia, Bas-
sanio is foreed to borrow money
from his generous friend, Antonio.
Antonio then borrows money from
a rich Jewish usurer, Shylock. Shy-
lock shrewdly agrees to lend the
money to Antonio with no interest,@
but a stipulation that Antonio will
forfeit a pound of flesh if he fails
to repay his debt on time.

Meanwhile back at the ranch,
Bassanio wins the hand of the fair
Portia, while his friend Gratiano has
married Nerissa, Portia’s waiting
maid. However, Antonio has failed to
repay Shylock on time..

Bassanio and Gratiano go back
to Venice to try to get Antonio out
of jail. Without anyone’s knowledge,
Portia and Nerissa, disguised as doc-
tors attend the trial of Antonio as
judges. They corner Shylock and
he is lucky to leave the court at
all. Then they tease Bassanio and
Gratiano and get their wedding
rings back as a gift of their services.

When Bassanio and Gratiano re-
turn to Belmont they discover that
their wives had disguised themselves
as judges. The ending is a happy
one for all but Shylock.

 

 

The Troubadours, who will present the “Merchant of Venice” Novem-
ber 18-21, have been practicing nightly during the past week for the up-
coming production. Here Charles Bright (left) discusses his lines with
Mrs. Martha Evans, while Mare Rehr and Kendall Jameison listen.

WE&L Student Aid Program
Increases Nearly Five-Fold

A nearly five-fold increase in un-
dergraduate financial aid over the
past decade was reported Monday
at Washington and Lee.

Lewis G. John, assistant dean of
students and director of the Univer-
sity’s financial aid program, an-
nounced that 257 Washington and
Lee students are sharing in $218,180
in scholarships, loans, and campus
jobs during the 1964-65 academic
session.

Dean John said that the total
represents a 487 per cent increase
over the level of undergraduate aid
ten years ago, when only $44,970
was available.

Glasgow, an engineer and honorary
alumnus of the university. Mr.
Glasgow died in 1955. His will di-
rected that income from the legacy to
Washington and Lee be known as

“promote the arts of expression by
tongue and pen.”

The current assistance also rep-
resents a significant increase over
1963-64 aid levels, when 246 stu-
dents shared $191,365 in aid funds,
Dean John said.

He pointed out that the under-
graduate totals do not include schol-
arships and loans awarded in the
School of Law where a separate
program of financial aid is adminis-
tered by Dean Charles Light, Jr.

Dean Light reported that 41 law
students are sharing in $24,372 in
financial aid this year.

Among undergraduate aid recipi-
ents are 60 freshmen who are re-
ceiving a total of $63,840, compared
to 1963-64 figures which show that
50 freshmen received $46,560 in aid
funds.

Dean John said that the average
amount of aid extended to under-
graduates is $810, while the freshmen
average is $1,064. He said the high
freshman average is the result of
joint efforts of increased expenses
for entering students and a substan-
tial inerease in the average need
of new students seeking financial
aid.

All financial aid at Washington
and Lee is based on need, academic

merit, and promise of successful
work at Washington and Lee. A
faculty scholarship committee is re-
sponsible for selecting aid recipients
among applicants for financial aid.

Scholarship funds awarded for
| 1964-65 total $128,547, awarded to
| 180 students. The most coveted
awards at Washington and Lee are
George F. Baker Scholarships, sup-
ported by the George F. Baker Trust

|

 

of New York, and the Robert E. Lee
Scholarships, suppored by an anon-
ymous benefactor.

There are 12 Baker Scholars at!
Washington and Lee, sharing a total)
of $13,250 in aid, including fresh-
men who are receiving $3,950. Lee
Scholarships are held by 16 under-
graduates, including six freshmen.
Of the $16,650 Lee funds allocated
this year, $7,400 went to the first
year men.

A total of 120 students are par-
ticipating in a loan program in-
volving $63,633. After graduation, |
students will repay the low interest
loans over a ten year period.

‘Dining Hall Removal of R-t P’s

Causes Delay Of Frosh Election

By GUY UNANGST

The Executive Committee

has set for Monday the post-

poned run-off election for freshman committeeman.

In a statement made after

its special meeting last night,

the committee said it has postponed the run-off originally
scheduled yesterday morning, to investigate rumors resulting

from the disappearance of the
from the coramons.

A waiter had taken the news-
papers “in order that the freshmen
would not prolong their evening
mea,l” the statement said.

“The basic reason (the election was
postponed) was the fact that there
were so many unfounded rumors
going around in the freshman dorm,”
Jim Kulp, student body president,
said last night.

The lead story in Tuesday’s news-
paper was on the original freshman
committeeman ballot, in which none
of the four candidates were able to
gain a majority vote. A banner head-
line had said, “Independent Fresh-
men Stop Clique.”

It was variously rumored that sup-
porters of Richard Nash, the Uni-
versity Party candidate, had ob-
jected to the headline and removed
the newspapers, that supporters of
Steve Saunders, an independent!
candidate, had removed them so as
to blame the University Party, and
that the Executive Committee would
take no action, Kulp said.

“We postponed the election to
find out who took them (the papers)
and why,” explained Kulp. “Politics
did not enter into the picture.”

The run-off, between Nash, who
received 111 votes last Monday, and
Saunders, who received 83, has been

 

STATEMENT OF THE EXECU-
TIVE COMMITTEE CONCERN-
ING THE POSTPONEMENT OF
FRESHMAN EC ELECTION:

Due to the number of unfounded
rumors circulating in the Freshman
Dormitory resulting from the dis-
appearance of the Ring-tum Phi
on Tuesday from Evans Dining Hall,
the Executive Committee determined
that it would be unfair to both can-
didates to continue the election, It
was the opinion of the committee
that until such times as the true
facts concerning this occurrence
were brought to light, the election
would be postponed.

From an investigation conducted
by the Executive Committee it was
revealed that the newspapers had
been removed from their usual place
by a waiter and placed in a side
room of the dining hall. On several
ocassions in the past waiters have
removed the newspapers in order

tion further revealed that the waiter
who removed the papers Tuesday
did so for the above stated purpose
and not to promote the election of
either candidate,

The Executive Comimttee will
take the appropriate action to in-
sure that the above practice does
not reoccur in the future.

The election for Freshman EC has
been rescheduled in Washington Hall
on Monday 26 October 1964 from
8:15 am. until 1:00 p.m.

 

scheduled for this Monday from
8:15 a.m. until 1 p.m.

Two other candidates, Jody Kline
and John Reynolds, both running
independently, had failed to make
the run-off.

Remarking on the missing news-
papers, Nash said last night, “It
might have added a little comic re-
lief to the whole thing. I only want
to urge that the freshmen look at
the candidates not be prejudiced
because one candidate is supported
by a party.”

Nash forces had charged, in a
Wednesday statement, that Saun-
ders had campaigned for the Pro-
gressive Party nomination and then,
when that party was dissolved, had
“championed the cause of the inde-
pendent.”

In reply to the University Party
charge, Steve Saunders stated that
“after the second (Ring-tum Phi pre-
ferential) poll, there was a period
in which I was not going to run
because I came out third, and I
thought the nominations would go
to the top two. The Progressive
Party never did make a nomination.
After the party realignment, I felt
there might be a chance for an in-
dependent candidate.

“If elected, I would put out some
kind of a regular bulletin... to keep
the freshmen aware of what the
EC is doing. Past freshmen commit-
teemen didn't find out what the
freshmen wanted—what the fresh-
men thought.”

Of the two candidates who drop-
ped out of the race in the primary,
only John Reynolds has publicly
supported either candidate. Rey-
nolds, who received 31 votes Mon-
day , has said he favors Saunders.

Rey de la Torre has been heard
by country-wide audiences in re-
citals and concert appearances, and
in various television shows such as
the “Guitar” Show on CBS-TV. He
has also been guest on such tele-
vision programs as the Jack Parr
Show, Today Show, and Camera 3.
Among distinguished appearances for
Rel de la Torre was his porform-
ance of a concerto for guitar by
Joaquin Rodrigo in premieres for the
United States with the Cleveland
Orchestra.

As an artist, Rey de la Torre is in
close touch with contemporary musi-
cal developments, particularly of the
United States and Latin America, with
special interest for his youthful asso-
in Havana. Many of h works
written especially for him by a
variety of major Latin-American com
poet

During the spring of 1962, Rey de
la Torre was heard in recitals in
Beigium. France, West Germany,
Greece, Iran and Lebanon. After the

Choice Of The Freshmen

The election has been postponed.

Freshmen Candidates State Views

Richard Nash

I am glad to have this opportunity to express myself to you
and clear up a few things. For it is only by learning the truth
that you can make an honest desicion and vote for the better
qualified candidate.

Steve Saunders

I want to thank all those freshmen who worked and voted
for me during this campaign. Without their electoral,
moral, and financial support our campaign could not have
gotten started.

The most probable reaction of this has been, “Oh, no,
not another four days of this political chaos, complete with
propaganda and name-calling.” However, the interest and
energy which this campaign has generated is a healthy sign—
it reveals a new sense of freshman responsibility, a concern
with the election of the most qualified candidate.

Many of those freshmen who are pledges of houses in
the University Party will be told that it benefits their house if
they vote for, and elect, the party’s candidate. Two things
should be considered by these freshmen: first, party instability
in the past points to the possibility that those in the party to-
day may not be in the same party tomorrow. Thus, their par-
ticular house may easily be merely a vehicle for another house’s
gain.

Secondly, and more importantly, this political fury is
transient; its death is near. The student government must
operate throughout the year. It is therefore evident that the
choice of the man, and not the mandate of the party, is of more
importance in the long run.

The fact of Nash’s party nomination doesn’t make him
any less qualified a candidate. Likewise, the fact of Saunder’s
lack of clique nomination shouldn’t detract from his being
given equal consideration as an able candidate.

Both candidates are qualified men, or they wouldn’t have
gained such strong support in the primary last Monday. We
wish, however, to emphasize the fact that the freshman Execu-
tive Committeeman should be elected as the freshman’s choice,
and not as the upperclassmen’s. This is a free election; you
have the right to vote for the man of your choice; don’t let
anyone deprive you of that precious freedom.

Because the freshman EC post should be held by the man
of the freshmen’s choice, we present here statements from
candidates for the voters’ consideration. We hold no party
lines, nor do we endorse any candidates. We have our prefer-
ence, of course, but above all else we'd like to see the freshman
class making up its own mind.

We present the men. We urge freshmen to meet them,
Question them. Decide which of the two candidates is your
choice as the most qualified. Then vote for the man of your
choice, without paying attention to anything but the man him.

self.

Editorial Freedom

“I do not approve of what you say, but I will defend to the
death your right to say it.” —Voltaire

Tuesday’s editorial endorsement of Steve Saunders has
generated a great deal of controversial feeling to the effect that
the Ring-tum Phi has no right to endorse either one candidate
or the other.

Friday's Ring-tum Phi feels that the choice of the freshman
Executive Committeeman should be left up to the freshman.
We choose therefore not to endorse either candidate.

No matter how differently the two editions of the
paper may feel about this, the belief of this staff is that
the Ring-tum Phi has the right to express any opinion
it may so desire in an editorial column,

Editorial opinion is editorial opinion. It is there for the
student’s consideration. In its editorial opinion, the Ring-tum
Phi is under obligation neither to anyone nor to any ideology
or representation of the majority student opinion. That the
opinion expressed should be in good taste goes without saying.

The Friday staff may not always approve of Tues-
day’s editorial policy, but it will defend its right to say
whatever it pleases. This is, after all, the essence of a

 

free society. ,

First I would like to straighten out something concerning

the University Party. When I was asked to run for the Execu-
tive Committee by the fraternities in
the party, I made it a point to find
out one thing—“Will I have any ob-
ligations?” And I can honestly say
to you that I had no obligations then,
I have no obligations now, and if
elected, will have none in the fu-
ture.

Remember, you are not electing a
party, but one man to serve you
on the Executive Committee. You
want a man that is mature enough
and level headed enough to make the
right decisions. The only man that
can do that is the candidate that
is most like you, one that knows
and understands how you feel and
what you want. I cannot believe that
you, a freshman at Washington and
Lee University, will vote for a can-
didate for the Executive Committee
on the basis of whether or not he
has the support of a party.

If you have taken the time to
read this letter, thank you very
much. And please, if you have any

his sexual proclivities. (Jenkins, 60
years old, has probably been prac-
ticing homesexuality for 30 or more
years. Men ordinarily do not, the

ning in their 20’s or even earlier).

That he was not is a fact worth

Perhaps he was particularly use-

And this is the real tragedy. Why

of his homosexuality, but rather be-
cause of society's unrealistic view-

posedly, experiences sex with a

It is widely known among psy-

average adult homosexual can lead
a productive, enriching life—if he is
allowed to do so. Because of the
legal and soeal sanctions against
him, however, he is forced to live
in two worlds, forced to be constant-

Needless to say, such a state is

at hand. For the past week, we have
forcefully presented a positive cam-
paign, based on positive ideas and a
positive candidate. We urged the
freshman class to “Vote for Leader-
ship,” not against anybody or any-
thing. We did not seek to advance
my candidacy by defaming my op-
ponent. Unfortunately, there are
those who apparently believe such
defamation adds to the success—if
not the moral luster—-of a campaign.
They believe that inept and crude
rumor tactics will impress the fresh-
man class. They think that if a lie
is big enough and loud enough, it
will drown out all voices to the con-
trary. They believe that the end will
justify the means.

But they are wrong. No end of
theirs is noble enough, no lie big
enough, and no false rumor be-
lievable enough to sway the body
of the freshman class. They can no
longer hide behind the facade of
innocence and humility which has
been so painstakingly created. Their
bag of tricks is empty. They now
stand before our class as the cyni-
cal and ruthless power-magnates
that they are .I need not go further.
All freshmen can decide the “truth”
for themselves. I do not choose to
leap down into the gutter to counter
the attacks of my opposition. Nor do
I believe that anything will be

but the central issue in this cam-
paign: qualification for office.

I offer for Executive Com-
mitteeman because I believe I have
the experience and ability necessary
to do the best possible job of repre-
senting the freshman class. It is my
feeling that this cireumstance has
not changed, neither has the issue
of qualification. If some deplore the
extent of our campaign, I hope they

‘Shot in the Dark’ Is Sill
Despite Emphasis On Slapstick

By JAMES JENNINGS

Inspector Cloiseau is back, and
this time he does a few things

oe) ae we right and even
gets the girl. Pet-
er Sellers, as
Cloiseau, teams up
with Elke Som-
mer, Hollywood's
new sex-machine,
to find out who
fired the “Shot in

the Dark” at

George Sanders’

chateau. The

movie is funny,

Jennings sexy, funny, tir-
ing, funny.

The opening scene of the movie
reveals everything but discloses
nothing. Apparently everyone in
Sanders household has a lover some-
where in the house, and there is
quite a bit of moving about every
night. Unfortunately, somebody does
not like the way that things are
going and a person is killed. Cloiseau
is called in on the case and four-
teen deaths later the case is closed,
and Cloiseau has solved a very com-
plicated series of murders. Among
the dead are a gardener, a couple
of nightclubbers, a Cossack, and a
doorman who just happened to be
standing around when Cloiseau is

present.

Tiresome
Sellers is very funny as usual,
but after sitting through “Pink

 

Panther” and part of “Shot in the
Dark,” one gets tired of Sellers’ no
longer subtle humor. He has be-
come very slapstick and American-
ized. Toward the end of the movie,
he is somewhat of an adult's Jerry
Lewis, only not as funny. The viewer
is prepared for most of his bits,
and he never disappoints us by pass-
ing one up. In his earlier movies,
Sellers is not so anxious to be fun-
ny every minute and, as a result,
his early movies are extremely fun-
ny and not so tiring as “A Shot in
the Dark.” The viewer never gets
a chance to catch his breath or really
think about the plot in this flick.
There has to be some seriousness in
a comedy so that it will not fall
flat on its face. There is none because
even the Commissioner, who should
be serious, out-does Sellers in some
of the scenes. Sanders, who would
serve a8 a serious counterpart, is

never on the screen except as
Sellers’ fall guy.
Successful

However, “A shot in the Dark” is
a successful movie, even if it does
not follow a sensible formula for
comedy. Sommer and Sellers make
a great team and are able to hold
our attention even though they
wear us out. Naturally, Elke Som-
mer is not allowed to dé any real
acting for the benefit of the movie,
and her own career as well, Need-
less to say, those things which she
is allowed to do she does quite well.

Generals, Tigers Clash Here Tomorrow

Lipscomb Leads Hampden-Sydney,

Team Has 4-1 Record This Year

By GUY UNANGST
Hampden-Sydney has scored 14 touchdowns en route to
four victories in its first five games. Quarterback Whitey Lips-
comb, only a junior, has had a hand in eight of them, several

in a spectacular way.

He has scored twice on short runs, returned punts 23 and}
74 yards for scores and passed for touchdowns of four, six, |
48 and 68 yards. *

[Stats Reveal General Air, 7

Lipscomb became a_ starter in
the last two games of his freshman
year, when All-Little Eight quarter-
back Fredie Mitchell was switched
to halfback. Last season he received
enough votes not only to be the
only sophomore on the All-Little
Eight team, but to be its captain as
well. He was also named the Tigers’
Most Valuable Player.

The 6-foot 185-pounder, who is
22 years old, does everything well,
trite though that may sound. He
starts at safety as well as quarter-
back and his two long touchdown
returns attest to his ability to re-
turn kicks.

Fifth in Virginia in scoring last
year, the Richmonder is probably
second only to Virginia Tech’s Bob
Schweikert among state quarter-
backs.

Lipscomb is not all the Tigers
have. Thirty-four men, including 18
lettermen returned from last year’s
team, which posted a 6-3 record and
defeated W&L, 12-11.

Five returnees earned All-Star
honors last year. The best are end
George Heilig, who has caught two
of Limpscomb’s touchdown tosses,
and tackle Sandy McLaughlin, a
senior and Washington and Lee
coach Lee McLaughlin’s nephew.

The two are co-captains of the
Tigers. Heilig holds the school re-
ceiving record while McLaughlin,
who missed first team All-Little
Eight honors by one vote last sea-

(Continued on page 4)

 

Ground Games Equal

Stastically, Washington and Lee’s
Generals are a much better team
than their 1-3 record indicates. Of-
ficial statistics for the Generals’ first
four games show that the W&L of-
fense has gained more yardage than
the defense has given up...even af-
ter last week’s game against Sus-
quehanna.

Through these first games, the
Generals have gained a net of 886

yards while their four opponents|'

have gained a net total of 806 yards

from scrimmage. The statistics had|

been even better before last week’s
Susquehanna game when the Cru-
saders gained a net of 365 yards
compared to just 156 from W&L.

Statistics also reveal a remarkable
balance in the Washington and Lee
offense. Through the first four games,
the Generals have gained exactly
443 yards rushing and 443 yards
passing for their total of 886 yards.

The pass defense reveals itself
to be outstanding. Opposition teams
have tried just 18 passes against
General defenders and have com-
pleted only six for just 79 yards. The
General rushing defense has been
slightly porous, having given up 727
yards.

W&L’'s red-hot soccer team (pictured above in their 5-1 victory over
Belmont Abbey) put their unbeaten record on the line this afternoon
against King College at Bristol, Tennessee. The Generals, possessors of

 

 

a 5-0 record, were rated as slight favorites in today’s game despite injuries
to several key men, Starting outside left Wes Horner did not make the
journey due to a badly bruised hip, opening up a gap in the front line
which was worsened by the absence of substitute forward Pete Heumann,
kept at home by a heavy test schedule. John Laimbeer will take over
Horner's position. Another second-string forward, inside Claude Rogers,
was afflicted with tendonitis and was not expected to be able to play.
And All-American candidate Dave Redmond was hampered by bruised
ribs, weakening the fullback position which has been the mainstay of
Coach Lyles’ booters this season.

Before its meeting last year with

Upsala also defeated the Crusad-

for the only two losses Susquehanna
has suffffered during coach Jim Gar-
rett’s four and a half seasons as
head coach. Garret’s record is 36-2-1.

“We want Upsala and we want
them badly,” Garrett said. “Our
team knows that we didn’t play
well against them and it has irri-
tated us ever since. We want to
win Saturday to regain our pride.”

 

Shooters Start Practice

Prospects for this year’s Washing-
ton and Lee rifle team are looked
on as uncertain, according to Ser-
geant Jim McSheffrey, coach of the
rifle team.

The team has been practicing for
more than a week now for its sea-
son opener on November 20 when
the University of Virginia squad
comes to Lexington for a dual meet
at the VMI rifle range. The squad
this year has a ten meet schedule.
Junior Harold Klick is captain of
the squad.

The freshman team, also coached
by McSheffrey, will open its five

‘Key Injuries Again Hamper W&L;
‘Brookby Novinger Are Doubtful

By JOHNNY GRAHAM

The Tigers that invade Wilson Field torommow afternoon
|| will be in football pads rather than gasoline tanks and will
| provide a severe test for Washington and Lee’s comeback-

Hampden-Sydney carries a 4-1 record into this crucial con-

test that may prove to be a grudge bout on both sides. The
* Tigers defeated W&L 12-11 last year

in a contest that many observers
called a fluke win. Hampden-Syd-
new is always primed for the W&L
game, considering the Generals their
major Virginia smal lIcollege rical.

The game has a history of being
a close bout. In the last four years,
there has not been over a one touch-
down margin. The Generals hold a
13-6 margin in the history of the
series.

Coach Lee McLaughlin will have
nearly his entire squad for tomor-
row’s contest. John Anthony, the
team’s leading ground gainer from
his fullback position, returns from
an injury that sidlined him for the
entire Susquehanna game. Jeff Nov-
inger, who sustained a shoulder in-
jury against the Crusaders, is a
doubtful starter. Halfback Henry
Brookby will be able to play, but
is a doubtful starter since he has
been unable to practice all week.

Hampden-Sydney is the first team
that the Generals have met all sea-
son that likes to pass. Thus far
in the campaign, four W&L oppon-
ents have completed six passes for
79 yards while the Generals have
connected with 42 passes for 443
yards, the same as the rushing yard-
age. The Generals’ rushing total of
two yards against Susquehanna is
misleading, by the way. The team
rolled for 42 yards from scrimmage,
but several long losses cut into this
yardage.

With 19 lettermen returning from
last year’s 6-3 team, Hampden-Syd-
ney shows a ballanced attack that
has punch both on the ground and
through the air. Quarterback Whitey
Lipscomb is one of the state’s best
and is ablely backed up by a trio
of running backs.

Coach MeLaughlin, although not
pleased with the showing, did see
some good points in last week’s game.
“We came out of a tough game
with the right mental attitude,” he
stated. “We never quit, and were

still hitting hard in the fourth quar-
ter.”

It occurred to me at the time
that they would have come to see
her no matter how she phrased it.

Similarly, no matter how my Eng-
lish teacher would have said it...

Getting there

Have you ever had the feeling
that you never are going to Get
There?

What I mean is this: whenever you
arrive at some great point in life
the powers that be always say that
the next place is the ultimate one.

I remember ’way back in kinder-
garten they said that grade school
was it.

That sounded fine to me, but in
grade school I learned that life
would really unfold in junior high.

Patiently I waited.

Now at last. But junior high}
pointed to senior high, and, yes,
senior high directed me to the Col-
lege of My Choice .

So here we are.

After being led from hope to hope
we arrive at the great door of
knowledge only to be told that our
dreams will be fulfilled after col-
lege, in the Market Place or in the
Higher Academy.

Each fraternity will be allowed to

The possibility of shortened classes
on the Saturday of Homecomings
was discussed and placed in the
form of a motion to petition the
Faculty Committee. With shortened
classes, fraternities could serve the
mid-day lunch earlier, thus en-

It was also moved by the EC to

KA National

Locates Here

Plans have been confirmed for
the locating of the national head-
quarters of Kappa Alpha Order in
Lexington and the erection of a
headquarters building on the site of
the Barclay house on Lee Avenue.

The national fraternity, which re-
cently purchased the Barclay prop-
erty will raze the present house and
build a colonial-style structure to
cost an estimated $110,000.

The total invesment of the frater-
nity in the headquarters property
will approximate $150,000 according
to Henry J. Foresman, a member of
the executive council of the Order.

Confirmation of the plans to con-
struct the headquarters here came
at a meeting of the executive coun-
cil in Atlanta last weekend. The
Order expects to break ground for
the headquarters next August during
its 100th anniversary convention.

The centennial convention will
open in Roanoke Tuesday, Aug. 24.

It will adjourn to Lexington, the
site of its founding, Friday, August
27 for commemorative and ceremon-

 

ial events.

Complete room and board for these
boys is provided by the host fra-
ternity, while tuition for two of
them is absorbed by the school with
the third receiving a_ scholarship
given by alumnus I. M. Scott. There
are usually seven or eight houses
on campus that wish to have a for-
eign students live with them for
the school year. they submit a re-
quest to the IFC and then consider
the applicants to see which one they
want. Final selection is made by
a pot-luck picking of names when
more than one fraternity is inter-
ested. Rarely, however, does one
house sponsor a boy for two years
in a row.

ulty co-ordinator of the program,

pean universities do not accept credit
given in the United States, the ex-
perience of the boys participating
is one of a practical nature rather
than specific, with the knowledge
learned something to be carried all
their lives.

er facets of their personalities, and
not as a heinous “crime against na-
ture?”

Yes, the Jenkins affair was “unfor-
tunate.” That such a thing can ever
happen is most unfortunate.
