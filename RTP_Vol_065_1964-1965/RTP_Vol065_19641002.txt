Releases IFC
Rush Report

Editor’s note: The following is
the official report on the 1964 rush
week by Interfraternity Council
Rush Chairman Mike McCord. It
was written with the assistance of
the individual fraternity rush
chairman and represents the offi-
cial conclusions of the IFC,

By MIKE McCORD
IFC Rush Chairman

Aside from minor problems, such
as a rushee signing up for two open
house dates or a fraternity failing |
to pick up a rushee, the IFC feels
that the new rush system went
smoothly. Nevertheless, there are a
few more major problems which
need to be ironed out.

One major problem which could
have developed was fortunately
avoided. It came about when a
rushee signed up for a rush date |
when he was supposed to be signing ©
up for an open house only. When
the matter was taken up by the
Judicial Board it was found such |
practice had not been

le

covered by |
the constitution, and they were able
to fill the gap before such procedure |

became common practice.

Problems, Problems

Another problem that arose, how-
ever, will not be solved so easily.
This is that the fraternities which
have the better-known national |
names obtained a far greater per-
centage of rushee at the open house
dates. This was especially true on
Thursday. To prevent this it has

Sazeracs Plan ’64 Calendar
Eight New Members Added

The Sazeracs, Washington and
Lee's nationally famous singing
group, has launched what is expect-
ed to be their finest season. The
group, which has cut a record and
made numerous appearances on the
east coast, this week added eight
new members and a new repertoire.

“We're making plans to do more
things this season and do them in a
new, and we hope, better manner,”
said Chuck Griffin, president of the
student organization.

Among the eight new members
are first tenor, John Ballentine;
second tenors, Roger Blair and
Warren Stewart; baritones, Mike
McCord, Al Byrne, and Roger:
Brown; and basses, Bob Lohman
and Harold Hobart.

Time Problem

The strict time limits for the open
houses presented quite a problem
during the first day. A number of
fines were levied, however, and the
problem seemed to work itself out.
This does not mean, however, that
some minor changes are not in order.
Perhaps a fifteen minute interval
might be more satisfactory for the
fraternities and the rushee.

On the brighter side, the whole
rush week went very well from the
IFC’s viewpoint. There were no
major infractions of the rushing
rules, the rushees were enthusiastic,
and the fraternities got their pledges.
It is hoped that the system can be
improved in the years to come, but
without the continued cooperation
of the fraternities such improve-
ment will not be possible. The IFC,
therefore, urges both the freshmen| There is room for all eight new
and the fraternities to suggest ways| members, but it will be necessary to

Therefore, all must go through a five
week probation period before a
final decision can be made.

“They're all fine singers,” ex-
plained Griffin, “however, if some-
one can’t blend with the group then
our whole effect could be ruined.
This is the reason for the probation
period.”

The nucleus of the group consists
of its seven returning members.
They are first tenor, Scott Darrah;
second tenors, Bud Goodheart,
Pete Hendricks, and Marke Gee;
baritone Rob Vaughn; and basses
Chuck Griffin and Dave Streetman.

“Our itenary for this season is
really shaping up,” said Rob Vaughn,
business manager.

Concerts have been scheduled at
all five neighboring girls’ schools, an
appearance in Richmond, and the
group's annual trip to Taboo
Club in Palm Beach, Fiorida.

The Sazeracs first appearance
en the Washington and Lee cam-
pus will be on Parents’ Weekend.

“We really enjoy performing for
the parents,” said Griffin. “By that
time we hope to have the new rep-
ertoire down and all fifteen voices
blending well.”

Griffin stated that once the new
group reaches the point that they
blend well together and once the
new repertoire is mastered, then
the Sazeracs will cut their second
album.

“Sales from the first album were
very good and we'd like to try it
again,” noted Griffin. “If everyiaing
goes well, we might be able to
record again this fall.”

Jim Kulp Selects
EC Committee
For Who’s Who

(In order to dismantle the shroud
of mystery which has seemed to sur-
round the EC, the Friday Ring-tum
Phi will be represented at all the
meetings of the Executive Commt-
tee to report the actions taken by
the student government.)

At the EC Tuesday night meet-
ing, President Jim Kulp appointed
a committee to make recommenda-
tions to the EC for Who's Who.
The committee is composed of Jim
DeYoung, Chairman, Bob Pless,
Rick Carrell, Dave Geer, and Chuck
Walker.

A motion was passed authorizing
that $1,000 from the Publications
Board Reserve Fund be spent to set
up a darkroom for the campus pub-
lieations.

A letter from the National Col-
legiate Magazine urging the student
government to support subscriptions,
as well as to contribute a short col-
umn was discussed. The suggestion
was made that the letter be given
to the Student War Memoria! Schol-
arship Fund Committee.

Brooks Brown, Chairman of the
Assimilation Committee, discussed
with members of the Executive-
mittee the policy that his commit-
tee will follow during the next
year. It was emphasized that the
spirit of conventional dress, rather

than a definite code of appropriate |

clothing, be stressed. Active sup-
port from all campus groups will
be solicited in this effort.

lar music. No other female group
can claim as many hit records, or as
long a period of success as these
four singers.

Shirelles’ Success Story
The Shirelles originally came from'
Passaic, New Jersey, where they.
were discovered by the president of
Scepter Records who heard them)
sing in a high school show. Their)
first recording, “I Met Him on a
Sunday,” became one of the biggest
hits in the country, and earned them
a long term contract with Scepter
Records. At present the Shirelles are
still recording for Secpter Records.
The Shirelles continued their suc-
cess with the subsequent recording
of “Dedicated to the One I Love.”
This song has now become somewhat
of a standard with lovers of popu-
lar music. Other hit recordings of
the Shirelles include “Tonight's the
Night,” “Will You Love Me Tomor-
row,” “Mama Said,” “What a Sweet
Thing That Was,” “I Don't Want to
Cry,” “Baby It's You,” “Big John,”
“Soldier Boy,” “A Thing of the
Past,” and many others.

 

 

Unique Singing Style

Many people attribute the suc-
cess of the Shirelles to their unique
singing style and sound. lt is pos-
sible for any one of the group to
sing lead, without the group loosing
its distinctive style.

For the first few years of their
eareer, the Shirelles toured the

Dance Board Announces
First Informal Dance Set

MILLER

Assistant Editor
The University Dance Board has announced that the inter-
nationally famous Shirelles will be the featured attaraction
of this year’s Opening Dance. Featured with the Shirelles will

from New York.

The appearance of the Shirelles on Friday night, October
16, will be their second appearance in the

past three years at

 

country as part of a road company
of rock and roll stars. Their recep-
tion was tremendous , and was

matehed by audiences during their
tours of Australia, England and
Frence.

In 1962 the Shirelles joined with
King Curtis, lesder of his own nae
tionally fomous band, to tour the
country in personal appearances and
3 t Tais uniting of two great
nome dded tremendously to the

both ec2reers. This combi-
nation, however, did not last, as it

 

  
 

broke up shortly efter its eppearznce
at W&L in 1°62. A permanent record
9f this unique combination is pre-

red in their hit album, “The
Shirelles

and King Curtis Give a
Twist Party.”

Six recent Hit Albums

More recently the Shirelles have
continued to record nothing but hit
songs. In addition to their impres-
sive lists of hit songs, the Shirelles
have recorded over six albums, all
hits.

Steve Hibbard, President of the
University Dance Board has an-
nounced that Dance Plans are still
available. They may be purchased
at the Co-op as late as October 15 for
the price of thirty dollars. This rep-
resents a savings of at least fifty per
cent from the cost of attending each
individual concert and dance.

 

Telephone Frauds
Becoming Serious

Several recent laws concerning
telephone long distance have result-
ed in arrest and jail sentences of
students who apparently are not
aware of the seriousness of such a
matter. Fines of $500.00 and jail
sentences of 6 months can result
from toll misuse.

Recently three Cornell University
students received fines and jail sen-
tences for attempts to defraud. Even
closer to home, a University of Vir-
ginia student was fined $100.00 and
sentenced to 90 days in jail for giv-
ing a wrong number on $18.00 worth
of toll.

The new laws involve the use of
wrong numbers or telephone credit
ecards to pay for long distance calls.
Also covered under the new pro-
vison is the illegal use of any type
recording to simulate bell tones on
pay telephones.

The new laws would also fall un-
der the Washington and Lee honor
system which could mean removal
from the University as well as the
removal from the University as
well as the fine or jail sentence re-
ceived

Editorial Policy

The foremost consideration in the determination of the
Friday Ring-tum Phi editorial policy will be what it considers
to be in the interest of the well-being of Washington and Lee
University.

 

While we recognize the importance of the concensus of
opinion, we do not concede its eternal validity; therefore, our
editorial position will never be assumed in order to express
the wishes of a majority of students or faculty, merely because
they are in the majority.

Editorials will express the opinions of the editorial board
of the newspaper. Second page bylined columns express the
opinion of their authors; they are not necessarily the opinions
of the newspaper, but serve to provide a forum for student
expression.

Letters to the Editor are encouraged and serve as another
means of student expression. All letters received will be pub-
lished, except those in poor taste or of extreme length.

While acting as a student forum the staff will try to remain
as fair as possible, prescribing to the codes of good newspaper
journalism.

It is through these standards that we, the Friday Edition
of the Ring-tum Phi, hope to serve the student body and ad-
ministration of Washington and Lee. Your comments and
interest will be appreciated.

The Dodo—Gone Forever

In the third issue of last year’s Ring-tum Phi, the following
editorial opinion was expressed:

 

“At the outset of every school year there appears
at Washington and Lee a last vestige of the days when
freshman hazing was sanctioned by the university and
by the student body. This last evidence that freshmen
are not really full human beings, this holdout of the
collegiate dark ages, is, of course, the ludicrous
“beanie.” It is truly farcical that the W&L student gov-
ernment expends effort to enforce conformity to the
wearing of this asinine skullcap ... .

Fortunately, for the whole of W&L as well as for
the freshman class, the beanie has disappeared from the
campus vogue; it has been buried like the dodo or the dinosaur,
hopefully, never to return.

The purpose of the beanie was, it seems, aside from intro-
ducing upperclassmen and Lexington merchants to new stu-
dents, supposed to instill a sense of pride in the indivdual. That
it did this is somewhat doubtful. Instead, it made the fresh-
man a marked man, setting him disgracefully apart from the
rest of the community.

A former chairman of the Assimilation Committee stated
in his R-t P column that “The traditions to which the student
body subscribes are constant values in an age in which the
very meaningless relative value too often is the standard against
which we judge our actions.”

We of the Friday Ring-tum Phi submit that not only was
the beanie a very meaningless tradition, but also that it was a
detriment in the assimilation of new students. On the other
hand, we believe that the name tags do have meaning in the
assimilation of freshmen. Not only are they more individualistic
in nature, they are also much more characteristic of a gentle-
men. It goes without saying that they better fulfill the pur-
pose for which they were intended—the incorporation of new
students into W&L life.

We applaud the Assimilation Committee and the Execu-
tive Committee for ridding us of this valueless dodo.

Of course—

Nothing can express the deep grief we feel at having
such a time-honored tradition untimely ripped from the Wash-
ington and Lee scene.

Nothing can replace the beanie.
Thank Goodness!

 

Sincere Appreciation

If you observed an article in the lower left hand corner
on the front page of last Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi with the head
“James Ambler Endowment Fund To Increase Faculty Sal-
aries” at all, you probably didn’t read it. To some it seems in-
consequential that a W&L alumnus granted this University
$100,000 in order to increase faculty salaries,

However, it is not frequently that such a generous
endowment is made to W&L. If so, it seems that com-
mon gratitude dictates that we express ourselves more
obviously than to hope that Mr. Ambler will infer the
appreciation that we feel.

The fact is that Mr. James C. Ambler of New York and
Montclair, New Jersey, who is Chairman of the Board of
Trustees of Ginn & Company, has granted Washington and
Lee $100,000 to support the James C. Ambler and James C.
Ambler, Jr., Endowment Fund.

Both Mr. Ambler and his son are alumni of this University
classes of 1918 and 1958.

Certainly we do feel gratitude that someone as distinguish-
ed as the Chairman of the Board of Ginn & Company has seen
fit to make such a generous grant to the University.

We do sincerely thank you, sir.

  

 

Is It Because We Didn’t Know?

 

Marshall Library Not Part of VMI

By KEN McGRAW

Since the completion of the George
C. Marshall Research Library last
spring, it has drawn very little stu-
dent attention. This seems to be true,
because we have the idea that the
library is part of VMI. I know that
this was the case for myself, and

I suspect that it is for many others
as well. This idea, however, is a
gross misconception as are a number
of others commonly held by students
concerning this library.

First, the library itself belongs to
the Marshall Foundation. It was

Hazing—A Thing Of The Past
“If You're Smart,” Freshman

By TRACY HARRINGTON '

Freshmen are settling down, now,
to the changless routine of Wash-|
ington and Lee life.

Those who are fraternity pledges |

will soon begin to realize that peo-
i Ple mean by “ral-

| lies,” “line-ups,”

and “fun and
games.” That is,
they'll fall into
the same old bout)
with the barf)
cocktail — unless |
they’re smart.

If they're smart, |
they'll tell the!
fraternities to take |
it in the appropri-
ate aperture—and
refuse to subject themselves to a
lot of senseless push-ups, duck
walks and infantile activities de-
signed to satisfy the sub-human
humor of sophomoric upperclassmen.

If they're really smart, the fresh-
men will wake up to the fact that
not a single fraternity can do
without a pledge class; that all
they have to do is say “no,” and
the houses’ hands are tied: that
threatened walk-out by a pledge
class would seare any fraternity
into rescinding a ridiculous tra-
dition; that the only way hazing
is ever going to end is by just
such radical action on the part of
freshmen.

 

carriugton

If they're smart they will agree
to do constructive labors, as a part
o fthe pledging period; they will be
skeptical of all the arguments used
to justify hazing, to wit: it united
a pledge class, it makes you appre-
ciate the fraternity more, it's a
tradition; they'll find a few honest
upperclassmen who'll admit that)
none of this is true, that the only!
purpose hazing serves is whetting a}
few sadistic appetites; they'll realize |
that nobody is “shaped up” by it,|

i

nobody profits from it |

 

If they're smart, they'll organize; |

they'll get together and work out
a plan of dealing with the houses:

they'll stick together and accom- |

plish one of the most needed
changes at Washington and Lee:

they'll come to this columnist, and |

a few other upperclassmen he can
name, and find out where to hit
the fraternities in their most vul-
nerable spots.

All this they'll do, if they're smart,
smarter than any freshman class so
far has been. But that’s pretty
doubtful.

Rider Proposes
Letter Solution

By BRUCE RIDER

Of all the banes of existence of
the modern college student, Writing
Home is about the baniest.

Yes, you are taking your vitamins.
Yes, you will look up Fred's neph-
ew over at VMI, but you just can’t
be expected to dash off a letter home
every month.

A college man’s time, as we all
know, is extremely valuable, and it
must be used wisely.

Therefore, it is necessary for you
to figure out some practical and ef-
fective school-to-home communica-
tions system whereby you will both
sooth the parents’ fears and free
your time for greater and grandier
things.

Here are a few suggestions, then,
concerning the means of solving the
problem of writing hime.

(1) Seratch out your name on
the envelope and write “Return to
Sender” on all letters from home. If
they recognize your handwriting
they will know that you are at least
safe, and most probably sound. Even
a brief “hi there” or “things are
swell at W&L” or I'm really enjoying
P.E. 1” scrawled on the back of the
envelope will be warmly received on
the home front.

(2) Or, you can get together with
nine or ten other students and or-
ganize a Letter of the Month Club
Each month one member of the
| Club will write a form letter for the
| whole bunch to send to their respec-

 

| tives homes. Thus you will only have
| to write one letter home per college
| year, or, if you are a long range
| planner only four letters per college
ieareer. Of, if you really don't want
| to go back home, and you go to law
| school instead, you need only to
| write a total of seven letters

puses of W&L and VMI, at General
Marshall’s suggestion through pri-
vate funds. The only official connec-
tion which these two schools have
is that their heads, Dr. Cole and
Major General Shell, are ex-officio
members to the Board of Directors.

Marshall’s Life

Another reason for the lack of
student interest may stem from the
fact that many of us do not realize
the importance of this project. A
short presentation of facts and fig-
ures should clear this up. Beginning
with Gen. .Marshall’s life, it is no
empty statement to call him one of
the most important men of the 20th
century. Between 1901 and 1945, he
occupied every commissioned rank
in the United States Army. He held
decorations from sixteen countries
as well as more than a dozen decor-
ations and service medals from the
U.S. He had bestowed on him six-
teen major civilian awards, including
the Nobel Peace Prize; fifteen hon-
orary degrees from colleges and uni-
versities, and was U.S. representa-
tive to fifteen international assem-
blies. He was author of the Mar-
shall Plan and held the positions
of Chief of Staff, Secretary of De-
fense, and Secretary of State in our
government. It should humble us to
think that through the Marshall Li-
brary, which is no more than a three
minute walk from campus, that we
have the most complete insight into
his life available.

Foundation Heads

| To point out further the import-
; ance of this library, we can look at)
the men behind it. One is former!

 

 

President, Harry S. Truman, who
first suggested the Foundation in
1953. Another is Gen of the Army,
Omar N. .Bradley, the present Pres-
ident of the Foundation. Acting as
Director for the Research Library is
Dr. Forrest C. Pogue, a well-known
author and educator, and there are
many other impressive names that
could be mentioned. .

At present, only the exhibit rooms
of the library are open. Designed
by the Smithsonian Institution, the
displays are impressive and exciting,
and succeed in giving an insight
into Gen. Marshall’s life. The most
memorable part of the exhibit
though is the half hour show put
on by a 9x12 feet electric map. By
means of flashing lights and a tape
recording, the map tells the entire
story of World War II. It was built
at a cost of $25,000.

Outstanding Library

In two years time the building will
house a large collection of docu-
ments, books, and records, including
Gen. Marshall’s personal papers. The
process of collecting and cataloguing
these is going on now. When fin-
ished, the Marshall Library will be
the most complete library on 20th
century diplomatic and military his-
tory in the South. The entire build-
ing and organization is a monument
to the words of Winston Churchill
who said, “Succeeding generations
must not be allowed to forget his
achievements or his example.’ I
would hate to think that W&L stu-
dents could be so apathetic as not
to take both interest and pride in
this project.

 

Beatles Make
In ‘A Hard

By JAMES JENNINGS

It seems that every singer wants
to make movies and every movie
star wants to sing.
I suppose that if
a person can do
both he becomes
a true entertainer
in the tradition of
Frank Sinatra or
maybe Gary Cros-
by or Fabian. Pro-
ducers and script
writers have a
rough time taking
a teen-age idol
and putting him
on the screen in a work that justi-
fies serious consideration or even
notable mention.

The Beatles solve all the prob-
lems of plot, characterization, and
justification of production by simp-
ly being themselves in “A Hard
Day's Night.” We watched these
clowns prepare for a TV show in
a way that not too many perform-
ers prepare for anything. They go
through rehearsals, night clubs,
each other, press conferences,
everybody else, and finally appear
on the show with their usual
sympathetic detachment.

The strong point of the movie is
the personalities of the Beatles. They
are delightful with quick wits and
a large capacity for enjoying them-
selves. They seem to enjoy being
together, working together, and
most of all making millions together.

John Lennon's bathtub scene is
amusing, Paul's grandfather offers
diversity, George is just there, but
he has his moment in the field, and
Ringo, “the middle-aged young
man,” has a sequence that is remin-
iseent of Charlie Chaplin or perhaps
Buster Keaton. The pantomime in
the field has been compared to
those of the Keystone Cops. It is
a very enjoyable frolic that enters
the film abruptly and departs in the
same manner.

One of the more striking as-
pects of the staging is that we do
net have to watch the Beatles

Military Virtue

By RICK SIMON

The tedium of classes has already
begun to lay heavy on the mind that
yearns to be free, and on the body
that yearns for something better
than the discomfort of the seated
position associated with study. That
is, it becomes increasingly evident
that it is indeed possible to yearn
while you learn. As the back stiffens
and, once again, takes on the con-
tours of a ribbed-back library chair,
we savor the less pleasant aspects
of the seat of learning.

As we look forward upon the
coming semesters there is a glint in
the eye, a pounding of the heart,
a trembling sensation in the pit of
the stomach in the general vicinity
of the navel, and united we say—
“YECH!” But let us not be dis-
trought. For the Peace Corps we
need a degree but not for the army.

. + >

The girl who called the house and
invited us to the Sem mixer sounded
sincere, but I cannot be certain. The
Mink has again run a valiant second
to the Veemi. Seems as though our
military counterparts are intent upon
maintaining their six-mile extension
of power. The young ladies of “the
hill” are so found of the uniform-
the symbol of discipline, of restraint,
of mannered conduct, of quiet and
calculating strength. How can we,
the very antithesis of military vir-
tue, even conceive of excluding them
from our house parties?

This week's rain has in no way
enhanced the already questionable
beauty of Lexington. But, discount-

W&L Meets Oberlin;

Both Lose

Openers

By GUY UNANGST
Like Randolph-Macon, Oberlin entertains Washington and

Lee’s football Generals after a season-opening loss.

The Yeomen fell last week

to Hiram, 23-6, a score which

is not as bad as it looks. The halftime score was 6-6 and last
year, when it was 6-2 for a second place tie in the 15-team

Ohio Conference, Oberlin
52-0.

Oberlin’s strongest point is its of-
fensive line, all seven members of
which returned from 1963’s first

string. It lists only guard Bert La-| Oberlin quarterback Dave Guerrera, |
' | injured last Saturday, would not be |

tran, a 210-pounder, as weighing
more than 200 pounds, but is noted
for minimizing its assets.

Dave Guerrera has switched from
defense to quarterback, where he
threatens a frequent roll-out option.
He threw 21 passes last week against
Hiram.

Power runner Bob Jenkins, a
halfback converted to fullback, does
most of the ball carrying. Last sea-
son he averaged 4.3 yards per carry.

The Yeomen run from an unbal-
anced line with split end Ed Siggers
being Guerrera’s favorite pass tar-
get.

Defensively, Oberlin lost several
starters, and freshmen must fill the
gaps.

The five-member College Athlet-
ie Conference opens its third season
of football competition Saturday
when Centre and Southwestern meet
in Memphis.

Other members of the conference—
Sewanee, Washington University and
Washington and Lee—move into ac-
tion in weeks following, with most
league play falling in late October
and early November.

For the first time since the “ama-
teur” conference was established in
1962, each member will play all
four conference opponents.

Defending champion Sewanee
bumped four league foes enroute to
a perfect 8-0 season in 1963, includ-
ing a dramatic, last minute 14-13
victory over Washington in the sea-
son's final game.

Intramural Week

 

Flunk-Outs Ruled I neligible

By JOHN BEAGLE
Students who have fallen under
the automatic rule and been rein-

stated by the university are in-
eligible to compete in intramural
sports, athletic director E. P. “Cy”
Twombly ruled Wednesday.

In the special ruling, handed
down at the request of the intra-
mural board, Twombly said there
had never been a set policy on
the matter in the past. Any rein-
stated student is also ineligible for
intercollegiate athletics, he said

The intramural board, meeting
with Twombly, also voted to ex-
tend the time limit in football from
eight to ten minutes running time
per quarter. The fraternities had
requested the action

| Ohio, and a clash with the Yeomen
of Oberlin College.

Injured in last Saturday's 8-0
loss to Randolph-Macon were ends
Bob Barclay, Bob Stauffer and Phil
Thompson. Running back Mike
Goode has been slowed by the flu
and probably will not see action to-
morrow. Sophomore Rob Reading re-
places Barclay who will handle
only the punting duties.

Center Jeff Novinger, who sat out
last week’s game with an injured
hand, will be in the lineup for the
first time this season. Another
change moved in fullback Tommy
Sparks as first team defensive line-
backer.

Coach Lee McLaughlin cited four
players for outstanding play in the
season opener. The passing combi-
nation of Larry Craig-to-Bill David,
which connected six times for 107
yards received special recognition.
McLaughlin also praised guard Joe
Miller for his job at linebacker,
and tackle Jack Kelley for his of-
fensive play

MeLaughlin also praised the way
quarterback Bryant Kendrick moved
the second offensive unit. Co-captain
Tommy Crenshaw was the big
ground gainer from his right half-
back position

The Generals, normally a grind-
it-out team, picked up 130 yards
through the airways against the
Yellow Jackets, only eight less than
their rushing yardage. Finding the
defenses keyed to a ground game
was the factor that led to the suc-
eess of the passing attack. McLaugh-
lin indicated that passing might be
the key to defeating Oberlin

In spite of a host of game mis-

takes—busted signals and four non-
eontact fumbles—MecLaughlin said
that the team “showed some real

good football. We just barely missed
on some running plays and made

some defensive errors.”

Behind the defensive play of
goalie Bob Larus and its three full-
backs, Washington and Lee’s soc-
ser team defeated Lynchburg, 2-0,
here Tuesday.

Larus made 12 saves and full-
backs Pete Preston, Howard Busse
and Dave Redmond played all 88
minutes in shutting out Lynchburg,
which was runner-up to Virginia
in last year’s state tournament.

John Van Bork, a foreign ex-
change student from Amsterdam,
and Dave Kirkpatrick kicked the
goals. Van Bork scored in the sec-
ond quarter on an assist by Kirk-
patrick, who took Brad Shinkle’s
pass for a third period score.

Linked with last week’s win
against Pfeiffer, coach Joe Lyles
said the victory indicates a success-
ful season. “It was something more
than a regular game,” he said.

Lynchburg, which does not play
football, strongly supports its soc-
cer team. “They had more fans than
here than we did,” Lyles said.

Lyles has moved All-State cen-
ter forward Tim Henry to right
wing and All-State right halfback
Wes Horner to left wing in order
to open up the middle. Van Bork
and senior Steve Hibbard replace
them.

The first string is strongly vet-
eran—“It’s the best first team in
the history of W&L,” Lyles said—
but the second team is composed
entirely of freshmen and sopho-
mores.

Today his team played at Ran-
dolph-Macon. The Generals won
last year, 6-1.

Frosh Open Season Tomorrow
Against Woodbury Forest

Washington and Lee’s freshman football team opens its
season against prep power Woodbury Forest here tomorrow.

Woodbury Forest, which won last year’s game, 28-0, de-
feated Collegiate 20-0, Saturday. Tomorrow’s game is at 2:30
p.m.

Coach Dana Swan will look to his squad’s depth—43 men
are out for the team—and it’s probably a safe bet his quarter-
backs—Andy Bloom, Richard Nash and Tom Pittman—will
do quite a bit of passing.

With 17 backs, as compared with six last season, Swan will
go with two both-way teams. The freshmen posted a 4-2 rec-
ord last year.

The cross-country team looks for its second win when it
runs against Lynchburg during the game. Coach Dick Miller’s
team defeated Roanoke, 15-50, last Friday.

Miller lost none of last season’s runners to graduation.

A final tabulation, complete with
breakdowns of the class voting, will
appear in the Friday edition.

Two voting stations were set up;
one in front of Washington Hall,
and the other at the entrance to the
Freshman Quad. Both were manned
from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. All un-

students were eligible to vote. Facul-
ty members were encouraged to
cast their ballots, but these were not
counted with the student votes. The|
poll was not announced prior to
today, so that the results would not
be affected by block-voting tactics.
Students were on their honor not to

The movie is designed to make

than the 69-vote plurality he receiv-
ed. Predictions overheard at poll-
places included: “It’s Barry with
90 per cent.” and “He’ll win (Sen-
ator Goldwater) 5 to 1.” There were
no voices raised in anticipitation of
a Johnson victory, but these first
returns ended Johnson supporters’
fear of a complete rout. The fact that
the ratio was four and one-half
to 5 and one-half in favor of Senator
Goldwater was encouraging in itself.
Final returns may trim the Repub-
lican’s plurality considerably.

The poll was arranged and con-

Kodak Contributes $1,800

To WG@L

To “Meet Rising Costs” of University

Washington and Lee University
has received an unrestricted direct
grant of $1,800 from Eastman Kodak
under the company’s aid-to-educa-
tion program for 1964.

Washington and Lee is one of 62
privately supported colleges and uni-
versities to receive direct grants
from the company this year. The
grants are based on the number >f
graduates from these institutions
who joined Kodak five years ago
and are presently employed by the
company.

Kodak has contributed $3,800 in
direct grants to Washington and Lee
since 1955. This year’s grant is based
on Joseph E. Kling, 52, who is em-
ployed at Eastman Chemical Pro-
ducts, Ine.

The grants are designed to help
compensate schools for the difference
between the actual cost of educat-
ing men and women now with Ko-
dak and the amounts these grad-
uates may have paid in tuition and
fees.

“Through these direct grants, Ko-
dak recognizes the importance of
higher education in the supply of

said Kodak president William S..
Vaughn.

Under the direct grants plan,
Kodak contributes $600 for each full
year of academic work completed
by an employee who has received
a bachelor or graduate degree at a
privately supported college or uni-
versity.

Over-all, Kodak’s contribution in
support of higher education will
total $1.5 million in 1964. The pro-
gram includes direct grants, research
grants, grants to liberal arts col-
leges, special gifts in support of
capital or endowment programs, and
a number of other contributions.

The company’s program of finan-
cial aid to higher education is de-
signed to help schools meet rising
costs and to recognize and encourage
excellence in American colleges and
universities.
