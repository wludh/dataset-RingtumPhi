His swift rise in Illinois polities and
impressive showing in his first try

speculation about Perey as poten-

for the Republican gubernatorial
nomination. Percy visited 44 county
fairs, shook 125,000 hands, and cov-
ered more than 140,000 miles by

plane, bus, train, and car.
ord primary election that saw over
a million registered Republicans
turn out, Percy beat his opponent
by more than a quarter of amillion
votes.

He lost to his Democrat opponent
in the November elections which
followed.

Popularity Rises Still

Perey has received mumerous
awards and special accolades in the
course of his active business and po-

degrees, is chairman of the board of
a Ford Foundation sub-committee,
and is a trustee of the California In-

Benevolent Dissolution

The building and grounds crew probably didn’t like it, but
last night’s elections were a success for the student body. The
University Party, which was gracious enough to disband for
one election but which predicted that the election would by
the absence of itself become a “travesty,” was wrong. The
student body managed quite well without a political party this
time.

Without the damper of Clique nominations an unpre-
cedented number of candidates seized the initiative and ran
on their own, the most healthy thing possible for student gov-
ernment. Although all the class elections were not decided last
night due to the necessity of run-offs between some of the
candidates, many races were decided. For the rest of the races,
last night’s voting was essentially a primary. The result will
be that the officers elected in this election are going to be the
ones chosen by the students themselves on the basis of candi-
dacies offered on individual initiative. It is hard to see how
such a neglect is a travesty — it is democracy.

Last night’s relatively poor turnout points to an improve-
ment which could be easily made in class election procedures
by the E.C. — to offer voting all day, as in student body elec-
tions ,instead of just for a few minutes one night. The nomi-
nations and speeches could be held the night before, and al-
though attendance might not be the best, as is the case with
student body elections, recent elections have tended to hit the
student body via literature and individual campaigning prior
to the speeches anyway. The run-offs for the present election
are being held only for a half-day; it is hard to see why the
E.C. cannot or should not hold the polls open for a whole day.

The Executive Committee seems to have been strangely
unprepared for the multiple candidacies which caused, as any-
body could have foretold, run-offs in many cases. The E.C.
spent a lot of time last night arguing over who to include in
the run-offs, but such procedure is explained in Robert's
Rules of Order. According to Article IV, Section F, of the
student body constitution, the E.C. should be following this
procedure.

Trends in the voting last night would be hard to point
out; perhaps they will appear more definitely after Thursday's
run-offs. At the present time, the important factors in this
election that can be commented on is that no political party
chose any nominees — the nominees ran for the offices if they
had the initiative. This is a fantastic improvement over past
elections, and the fact that the elections went successfully
proves that parties are unnecessary in essence. In the future,
perhaps parties will assume their rightful role in elections: that
of running free and fair primaries in advance of the elections,
and of organizing campaigns for the winners of their pri-
maries. In this way way nominees could be saved most of the
expense which many candidates had to shoulder in the present
election.

least it is hard thought in the right
direction, and the result is for the
most part very fetching indeed.
Also, Donner demonstrates a tal-
ent for getting the best out of his
actors: if Millicent Martin as a mod-
ern upper-class miss (snooty but
sexy with it) is appreciably miscast,
Alan Bates haas exactly the neces-
sary mixture of charm, and

formance as the instructor who
makes over his own past into the
hero’s future. Indeed, it is a pity in
more ways than one that he has to
be murdered two-thirds of the way
through the film. Apart from any-
thing else, this does play havoe with

any satirie point the plot may have|

had as a representative case (if the
meteoric rise of the hero can only

be achieved by way of murder, that!

many fewer junior clerks in the au-
dience are going to try it.) But as a
light (visually speaking, at least)
often witty fantasy,Nothing But the

tertainment value to send one, if
not cheering, at least purring quite

It came to me at 8:50 during my

into my mind: a) who was Dean
Pinto?; a) what was he dean of?;
c) why did he want to see me? All
I could do was wait until 11:10.

Which I did, in the library, mull-
ing over old Ring-tum Phi's, dis-
covering no clue as to Dean Pinto’s
identity or how one R-tP could be
distinguished from another. (J firm-
ly believe that in 1948 an original
copy was printed and since that time
has been distributed twice weekly
among the faculty and student body.
There is no way to prove or dispute
this claim, however.)

By TOM CARPENTER

This past Saturday was the horse
raving fan’s delight, what with the:
Kentucky Derby and the Virginia
Gold Cup Races. One had his pick)
of sitting at home and watching the)
kine of the flat races in the United
States or going to Warrenton, Vir-
ginia, and seeing in person a combi-
nation of flat, hurdle, and timber
races. Some ingenous souls did both
by taking along to Warrenton bat-
tery-powered portable televisions.

Gold Cup Event

The Gold Cup quite social
event in Virginia, as the crowd con-
sists of ambassadors to the every-
day working-man. Anyone willing
to shell out fifteen bills is weleome
at the Gold Cup with one guest.

Equipment for such an outing con-

 

is

a

ts of a blanket or chairs, an ice
cooler filled to the brim with cold
beer or some stronger concoction,

and a pieniec lunch. This year um-
brellas also were the call as a thun-
derstorm became an unexpected part
of the day’s events.

Bookmaking Shops

The Gold Cup Committee also pro-
vided the man with a flare for gamb-
ling with the necessary opportunity
to satisfy himself by allowing any-
who willing to pay fifty
bueks for a Federal Gambling Stamp
to set up a bookmaking shop at the
base of the hill.

one Is

One might regard these gentle-
men as crooks as soon as he sees

the odds they offer on the horses
running in the Kentucky Derby and
in the Gold Cup. It seems safe to
aassume that they enjoy a profitable
day's work.

The biggest preblem one has is
making logical selections of winners
in the Gold Cup races because in-
formation on the horses is hard to
come The clue to their
ability the weight allowances,
which are often based on past ree-
ord. Besides, the best horse in the

jump.
Hill Obseures View

The track itself is laid out around

'a large hill, which most of the spec-

tators sit on the side of another hill

| outside of the racing area. Thus, vis-

ion of a race is obscured when the

| horses go behind the hill in the cen-

ter of the track. A unique experi-
ence I suffered on my first trip to
the Gold Cup was watching my
horse go behind the hill, never to
be seen by me again. For all I
know he may be buried back there.

There are six races on the day's
agenda, although this year
were seven because of an unusually
high number of entries in the last

race. After the fifth one the public;

address system is used for the broad-
east of the Derby, although this year
the fire at Churchill Downs delayed
activity until after the sixth race.

Kentucky Derby

The Derby was interesting this
year in that heavy favorite finished
next to last and a longshot almost
managed to pull out the victory. Of
the four tickets of various kinds and
owned by various people that I was
holding, nene was worth a blade of
grass.

Flag Raiser, on whom a friend

had placed five dollars to place, led

early and faded. Tom Rolfe, on
whom the group had two $2 win

tickets and one $5 place ticket, just
did not have the speed to do the
trick and finished third.

Reports from Louisville indicate that
a large delegation from W&L was in
atendance at the Derby and various
related functions. Although the infield
at Cehurchill Downs was particularly
hot, some of the real excitement and
color of the race was found here rather
than on the nearby track

In the Viriginia Geld Cup race,
the main event of the day, I took my
chances with an older horse, who
naturally finished last and was so
far behind he skipped the last two
jumps and still was unable to gain

tary Institute to gain their fourth
consecutive Virginia collegiate track
title on Saturday in Wililamsburg.
The Washington and Lee track team
tied for eighth place in the meet
which attracted thirteen of the state’s
top track outfits. In the freshman
division the Generals placed seventh
with 9'2 points as William and Mary
also took that title with Virginia a
distant second.

For the Generals, the outstanding
performance for the afternoon was

a war 4,000 miles from its own terri-

tory?

In an accompanying article, Dr.
Colvin speaks of the difficulties in
convincing Americans of various po-
litical persuasions that our ultimate
desire is a withdrawal on acceptable
terms. If we have trouble convinc-
ing those who have been brought up
in an atmosphere permeated with
American international benevolence
of our good intentions, how are we
to convince those whose background
has been dominated by anti-Ameri-
can feelings of one degree or another?

If the United States is to lose this
bad name it seems to have acquired
in many places, it must broaden its
“official line.” Our present “holier
than thou” stance is regarded as
hypocritical among even the friend-
liest of our overseas allies. People
are getting tired of hearing how we
have been selected as God’s chosen
people to save the teming millions
from communism, the greatest evil
ever conceived by man.

We must show that we oppose
communism not just because it is
communism per se, but because it
happens to be antithetical to certain

rights which we consider to be in-
violatable. In other words, our dis-|
taste for communism should be

shown to fit into a previously form-|

ulated framework of unacceptable

political practices, rather than being!

one unto itself.

The fighting in Vietnam and the)

intervention in the Dominican Re-
public in themselves do not really)
bear on the question; what is im-
portant, however, is why
fighting and intervening. Viewed in
this light, the key to our success in

the world arena will rest in the rev-)

to be)
to be
labeled

elation of what we consider
certain evils which happen
wrapped up in a package
“communism.”

votes. Lee Staniar came in last with

In the race for class historian, Bob
Priddy polled 62 votes, Tom Hardin
polled 28, Rob Reading polled 29,
and Tim Crowley trailed with 15
votes. Priddy, Hardin, and Reading
will face each other in the run off.

Morris Chairs Meeting

Malcolm Morris, student body sec-
retary, acted as chairman of the
meeting. As the meeting opened, a
motion was presented and carried
by voice vote that allowed only the
candidates for executive committee-
men to make speeches. All other
candidates were nominated without
comment.

The remarks by the four men
seeking the E.C. positions were on
the whole very brief. All the candi-
dates stated their support for the
honor system. Various changes were
suggested by all four candidates.
Kirk Follo promised to work for a
new and more just cut system and a

change in the grading system which
he has already presented to the exe-
cutive committee of the faculty. Bill
Jeffress suggested that the E.C. work
toward better facilities for non fra-
ternity students, drinking at univer-
sity sponsored athletic and _ social
actiivties, and the abolishment of
Saturday classes. Jody Luck, who
placed third in this race, attacked
the present E.C. for ignoring the
needs of the student body.

Bill Grant, who trailed in the exe-
cutive committeeman election, prom-
ised to seek a concensus of student
opinion and ideas rather than trying
to put across only his own.

Vice President-elect Alan Wade
was opposed by Buddy Nicklin, a
nominee of the Do Nothing Party.
Wade won with 100 votes against
Nicklin’s 37, The Do Nothings also
nominated Tom Hardin for historian
and will get another try at that posi-
tion in the run off. It had been an-
nounced that Do Nothing candidate
Duncan LaMonte would seek the of-
fice of secretary, but LaMonte with-
draw yesterday.
