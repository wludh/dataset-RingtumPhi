The new W&L chapter of Circle
K, international college service club,
met last night to organize commit-
tees and plan of relection of offi-
cers.

Cirele K was started at W&L last
spring when a small group of stu-
dents met to discuss the possibility
of a club forming this year. The
group, headed by Jody Luck and
Dave Shuffelbarger, contacted the
Lexington Kiwanis Club for help.
Wiwanis is the parent organization
for Circle K.

As a result, the Kiwanis Club
vote dto send Shuffflelbarger and
Luck to the International K Con-
vention in Chicago. On their return,
they made a report to the Lexington
Kiwanis Club. This year, on No-
vember 4 an organizational meeting
took place and the machinery was
set in motion to work toward a per-
manent organization.

At the first organizational meet-
inf, the Governor of the Capital Dis-
trict of Circle K Clubs, Graham Per-
kins, and one of his Lt. Governors,
James Wyatt, were present and ex-
plained to the students assembled

E.C. Sets Date of Dress Referendum,
Rejects Proposal for Election Reform

 

 

Junior Class

Poll Reflects

Opinion on Dress, Committee

By STEVE SAUNDERS

Results of a poll on conventional
dress taken among members of the
Junior class at the beginning of
the semester by Junior E.C. repre-
sentative Fred Mindel were released
today. Sixty per cent of the class
filled out the questionnaire. Results
indicated definite approval of con-
ventional dress, but wide-spread dis-
enchantment with the Assimilation
Committee as presently constituted.

Three Questions

The questions posed in the Mindel
poll were similar to those which will
appear on the December referen-
dum ballot. They were: 1.) “Do you
favor conventional dress?”; 2.) “Do
you think an Assimilation Commit-
tee is necessary to uphold this tra-
dition?”; and, 3.) “Do you favor the
Assimilation Committee as it pres-
ently exists?” Ninety-one per cent
of those possed answered affirma-
tively to the first question. Fifty-
eight per cent of those polled said
“yes” to the second. However, only
twenty-seven per cent answered af-
firmatively to the last question, re-
lating to the Assimilation Commit-
tee as it now stands.

Mindel’s Purpose
According to Mindel, “...the pur-
pose of this questionnaire was to

| class on some the major issues con-

fronting the Student Body.” When
asked for comment on the results,
Mindel replied, “I believe the school-
wide referendum will show these
same results; that the large majori-
ty of students find themselves com-
patible with the principle but not
the enforcement of conventional
dress. Their objections and criticisms
stem from the enforcement of the
principle by the Assimilation Com-
mittee.”
Requests Suggestions

A fourth question posed by Min-
del in his Junior class questionnaire
was: “What improvements would
you suggest?” Most of those who
took part in the poll suggested im-
provements dealing with liberal-
izing present enforcement.

Ideas mentioned most frequently
were: permitting wheat jeans and
sweaters with tie as acceptable con-
ventional dress; removing restric-
tions on Saturdays, Sundays, and
after dark; and on stressing a general
neat appearance rather than specific
attire.

Also repeatedly expressed was the
wish to see a more definite Assimi-
lation Committee policy. Indicated as
well was a feling that the Assimila-
tion Committee should be more rep-
resentative of the Student Body and

December 9 was set as the date for a student body refer-
endum on conventional dress and the Assimilation Committee,
as the Executive Committee acted last night on a petition to
bring the enforced tradition of coats and ties to an opinion
vote. The EC also selected the wording of the four choices
which will be offered students on the ballots in the referendum.

“Mark One Only”

Each student will be able to vote
for only one choice in the referen-
dum, which cannot concreately af-
fect the present traditions or its
administration, since to do so would
require a constitutional amendment.

The referendum will be held in
Washington Hall, from 8:15 a.m.
till 2:00 p.m. on December 9. The
results, said student body president
Jim Kulp, will be made available
to the Ring-tum Phi before Christ-
mas vacation.

Last night's action by the EC
was the result of a petition insti-
gated by a small group of students,
the spokesman for whom has been
Sigma Chi Warren Montgomery. The
EC had requested the opinion of the
Assimilation Committee before
it acted on the petition, and Assim-
ilation Committee chairman Brooks
Brown appeared before the EC last
week.

Freshmen Appointed

Freshmen appointed to serve on
student body committees were
Chuck Fatzinger, the Library Com-
mittee; and Emory Waters, the Cold
Check Committee. In selection of
the freshman representative on the
Assimilation Committee, the BC vot-
ed to have personal interviews with
five freshmen next week.

The five picked for interviews
are Dave Dougherty, Steve Shep-
herd, Luke Crosland, Jody Kline,
and Harold Stowe. These men
were all “strongly recommended”
by a subcommittee which went
over all applications before the

Huxley’s Literature and Science will
be reviewed by Sid Parham.

The issue will be put on sale in
the student co-op and in local book-

 

 

stores, but Ledbetter said that sub-
scriptions are still available. Led-
better and junior Grayson Powell are
co-editors of the magazine, which
is in only its third year of existence.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Why Not Gracefully?

The Ring-tum Phi prints today a letter to the editor
which is good evidence of the probability that some peo-
ple will never be able to adapt themselves to some of the
changes which have occurred in the last few years. The
author of the letter shows his littleness by refusing to
capitalize the word “Negro,” which is capitalized by Noah
Webster, among others; this man’s attack is not serious.
There is, however, a somewhat more serious attack tak-
ing shape on campus in the form of a student petition
which protests the Board of Trustees’ recent announce-
ment that there will be no racial discrimination in W&L
admissions policy.

The extent of the petition’s circulation, and the suc-
cess it is having, are unknown because the thing is evident-
ly an underground movement so far. Perhaps the origina-
tors of the petition are ashamed to have their identities
known at large. At any rate, underground movement is
what can be expected of the kind of people who are fight-
ing integration. These are people who have gone into hid-
ing from the vast majority of Americans, and indeed from
the twentieth century. These are people who must go un-
derground to save themselves from reality. These are
people who have failed to present a single effective argu-
ment for inflicting their prejudices on the rest of us;
their only weapons are those which force them under-
ground.

The Board’s announcement of non-discrimination
was made because Washington and Lee could no longer
hold its head up as a leading educational institution until
it removed itself from the suspicion of prejudice. The
announcement did no more than affirm the simple old be-
lief that all men are entitled to equal dignity, regardless
of the color of their skin. The question is no longer wheth-
er to integrate or stagnate—that has been decided—the
question is whether Washington and Lee can integrate
gracefully.

The students responsible for the present petition
may be able to create a regrettably awkward situation;
this is the most they could accomplish. It is inconceivable
that the faculty, which has long waited for integration
and which now has been given control over admissions,
would reverse its present course. We urge students to
listen to the plea of Jim Kulp, president of the student
body, and to continue to support the university in its
policies. We urge that the decision be accepted gracefully.
Last year’s student body president, Bill Noell, gave the
same advice—on the same subject—many times, as did
the only class representative to the EC to speak at
last month’s leadership forum. Only the men who are car-
ride along blindly by their own prejudices—or by those
of their parents or friends—can disregard this respon-
sibility to the school; in doing so they will also be disre-
garding a responsibility to themselves.

 

 

Hardening of the Arteries

The decline of Washington and Lee’s only prestigious
student discussion group is a sorry sight. The Liberty Hall
Society, once a serious and productive organization, has
fallen into such disrepair that perhaps it no longer ever
lives up to its name of an ‘intellectual discussion” society.
The specific reasons for the failure of Liberty Hall are not
for us to know, since the society is semi-secret; but the
root of the trouble seems to be what must be Washington
and Lee’s biggest trouble: intellectual apathy. “Apathy”
is a notorious cry, it is true; but if Liberty Hall can attract
only five or six “intellectuals” to its meetings, perhaps
student inertness has really reached a new peak.

Perhaps it is time to take a point from Sylvia Doughty,
the Hollins editor who last week condemned Washington
and Lee men for their “adolescent preoccupations.” Time
for Washington and Lee to reconsider the fact that if a
man does not give his time to intellectual pursuits while
he is in college—he is unlikely ever to be affliated with
these pursuits. Time for the fraternity system to take a
look at the effect it has on the college career. Time for
somebody to realize that, whether the accusation of
“apathy” is parochial or not, it is accurate.

The ailing Liberty Hall Society is not the only evi-
dence of this. Nineteen sixty-four was an election year,
but the presidential campaign made literally no impres-
sion on this student body. Lectures and concerts go poorly
attended. Neither student nor university sponsored liter-
ary magazines get much student support. In fact, the
only thing which has aroused prolonged student activity
here in the last few years is the Conservative Society and
its newspaper, the Southern Conservative.

It is possible that the “Contact” organization will pro-
duce a discussion weekend which will overcome indif-
ference, Or that Ariel will become a vehicle for intellectual
expression. Perhaps the Liberty Hall Society can be over-
hauled and regain the stature it had when it undertook
such projects as the examination of the college’s curri-
cula. The new “Circle K"’ club may become an active serv-
ice club and involve more students in outside activities.
Maybe some professors will break through the barrier to
intellectual enthusiasm. But if so, it would be a very
noticeable change.

This has been a bad year for
movies. At least in Lexington.
Whether to blame it on the local
empresarios, on the distribution
procedures which handicap them, or
on the actual products of recent
industry and individual efforts, I
don’t know. But the regrettable and
expensive fact persists that movies
are worse than ever: regrettable for
obvious reasons; expensive because
people, well, students, continue pay-
ing to see films of mediocre quality,
if only for want of something else
to do.

All of which is not to say that
there has not been occasional re-
spite from the dull pattern spun
by such regulars as Anthony Quinn,
Henry Fonda (D-N.Y.) Stefanie
Powers (she surfs), and Shelly
Winters. For a few enjoyable films
have appeared: Billy Liar, The Five
Day Lover, A Hard Day’s Night,
Viridiana, and, surprisingly, Topkapi.
Billy Liar triumphed because of the
essential appeal of its title character
—or, perhaps more accurately be-
cause of the ease with which one
could identify with his situation. The
Five Day Lover was interesting for
its Flamboyance, instances of which
were incorporated by Truffaut in
Jules and Jim.

Phillipe de Broca, who made The
Five Day Lover in 1960, is a director
worth watching, as his That Man
from Rio (1964) will verify—though
Andrew Sarris, a bad American
critic writing for a bad American
mwspaper, calls de Broca a bad

"Viridiana’”’ Best So Far

 
 

 

Rives Calls 1964 Bad Year
For Flics; Picks Top Five

By Robert Mac Rives

French director making bad Amr-
ican movies. Weismuller has voiced
the same criticism.

To continue, however: A Hard
Day’s Night—the Beatles are uni-
maginative in their rebellion, man-
ufactured or no, against society; they
really don’t have long hair; they
can’t sing; they’re queer, ete. But
A Hard Day’s Night is probably one
of the best and certainly one of
the most outstanding movies of the
year.

Viridiana is the one singularly out-
standing film to have played at the
Lyric or State since September. It
is not a profound movie; deliberate
though he is Bunuel plods mainly
on the surface. But it is an almost
perfectly structured one. That is a
very general assertion, and I hardly
have space here to support it. Yet
granting me that the framework of
Viridiana is so precisely ordered, one
still, I must acknowldge, is justified
in quibbling with its content. Subtle-
ty is not a Bunuel trademark; and
he might have done well to have
ommitted some of the more blatantly
symbolic elements of Viridiana.

Finally, Topkapi, despite excess-
es of acting by Peter Ustinov and
Melina Mercouri and of direction
by Jules Dassin, emerges a divert-
ing picture. Topkapi is supposedly
the light version of Dassin’s Rififi;
and though some would argue that
the latter itself was rather comic
in effect, Dassin’s success in render-
ing Topkapi amusing is considerable
and, this time, intentional.

The five films mentioned above
represent the best that has been of-
fered Washington and Lee movie-
goers this fall. Undoubtedly there
are those who would disagree with
me, but not seriously—for the level
of the movies given us hasn’t beeen
sufficiently high to provoke much
interest, still less debate.

The problem of screening poor
films is not a new one at the State.
Tied to chiefly domestic production,
the State management has small op-
portunity to show more than a
minimal number of premium fea-
tures. The Lyric, on the other hand,
with more leeway in contracting,
has heretofore been able to present
a more varied and stimulating fare.
Such, however, has not quite been
the case lately.

It isn’t that the movies at the
Lyric have been so bad; it’s rather
that they’ve been average—a ques-
tionable adjective to use when
speaking of what is purportedly art,
but which nonetheless seems to ap-
ply here. “In between” is what I
mean to cannote: not good, not bad,
just there.

Movies such as The Seven Sa-
murai, the Chaplin masterpieces, the
Hindu Trrilogy of Ray, the Magician
and even The African Queen are
available. Maybe, of course, there
isn’t much demand for them; but
I for one would like to see them
replace the neutrality of, say, The
Four Days of Naples and Phaedra
(coming).

 

Ed Walker, The Man Behind the Scenes

 

The Real Boss in the

By EAGLE SCOUT DEAN

The Sphinx now asks a new ques-
tion: “Who can beat Hobby Mor-
rison at pool, set the fastest head-
line around, break the biggest gamb-
ling join in Reno, and lead the
Rockbridge Boy Scouts to victory?”
There is only one man around that
I know could begin to liv up to all
these noble attributes, and that is
naturally Edwin T. Walker, Jr.—
“Prince of the Print Shop.” By now
you probably know I'm talking
about “Ed.” You see, many people
never get to know Ed really well
unless they work in the print shop,
play a superior game of pool, or are
a Boy Scout. I'm in th Scouts, so
that’s how I know.

The first time I saw Ed was as
an innocent little freshman who had
to turn in my first story at the
print shop. Well, I walked in a
little nervously, and all of a sudden
this great big guy pops up from
behind the stove and says in a
gruff voice, “Well, what do you
want?” From the tone of his voice

I could tell he meant business but
I just couldn’t get anything out
quickly. And, then before I knew
what was up, I had lost my Scout

couldn’t figure out how I had lost
so much, but I was to get used to it
in the years to come. You see, Ed
runs the notorious BBB (Better Bet-
ting Bureau).

One thing about Ed, he never
loses an argument. Usually you
never get to second base arguing
with him, but if you really have a
good point and Ed is hard pressed,
he resorts to his famous “argument
crusher”: “Well can you whip me?”

The funny thing is, Ed’s usually
right.

There is a story (though I don’t
believe it) that there was once an
editor who could put Ed down. No,
it wasn't Steve Smith—his name was
Lanny Butler or something like that.
One version goes that Lanny took
up Ed's challenge one day and pin-
ned him. Naturally Ed protested that
Lanny was out of his 137 weight
class. The other version has it that
Lanny and his whole staff took on
Ed with the help of a few lead print
bars and got the best of him. That
was the first time the Ring-tum Phi
did not come out on time. Once I
asked Ed about Lanny and he simply

MAMA Sends Help to Lexington:
Sponsors Petition to Save University

By ADDISON BROKENBOW

She was the first little old lady in
tennis shoes I had seen on the W&L
campus, so naturally I stopped. “Ex-
cuse me, madam, are you looking for
your date?”

“No indeed,” she says. “I've come
all the way from Nashville to visit
your beautiful campus as a represen-
tative of the Mothers for a Moral
America, I have a son about your
age myself, you know. Does your
MAMA know you never cut your
hair?”

“Well, ma’m, that's
style in these parts.

“Well, and I guess it's also the
style to vote a gangster and a tool
of the Communist Conspiracy into
the White House, and I guess it's
also the style to write columns de-
fending hideous perversions. Have
you read this book,boy?” The right
tennis shoe kicked me in the shin.

“Well, ma'm, that’s sort of the
I have it, all right.”

“Right! That's right! The leftist
conspiracy is creeping more and
more boldly into power. Do you
know that 48 per cent of college
presidents have been proven to be
socialist orientated? And that's why
I'm here, you know.”

“Oh, you're here to check out our
administration, eh? I understand that
several members of the faculty have
traveled to Russia at one time or
another.”

“Yes, I'm keeping an eye out for
that, too, but that's not exactly why

the sort of

I'm here. MAMA is watching you
young men all the time, you know.
And we think there is something sin-
ister going on here which you may
not even realize. Here, read this
petition.”

I read the petition, which had dot-
ed lines on the right side only. The
petition was for the condemnation of
any moves to dilute the character
and quality of the student body of
the university. It had already been
signed by scores of students. MAMA
had evidenly not rested from its mis-
sion.

You sign that petition, boy, and
you'll be helping to save your school
from the hideous perversions which
the Liberal Conspiracy has inflicted
on all the other schools in the coun-
try. Yes, this may be the only school
which we can save from prog—radi-
cal changes. Thank goodness, there
is still Washington and Lee carry-
ing on the grand traditions of
Jefferson Dav—I mean George
Washington.

“And after you sign this, boy, you
go back to your apartment—you're
not one of those radical perverts
who live in the dorms, are you—and
write a letter to your congressman.
Tell him how you feel and tell him
about the uphill crusade which
MAMA is waging. Understand?” She
got me in the shin again.

“Yes, ma'am, and while you're
here why don’t you go by and see
Coach Lord. He needs a little old

lady like you in the middle dist-
ance.”

“Don't be a smart-alec, young man.
Now you just take one of these pe-
titions, and you get all your friends
to sign. I understand the Mongolian
Finks are a strong right-wing group.
You get the Mongolian Finks to sign
up, every one. How would you like
to have one of those radicals date
your sister, eh? Think about THAT

“And be careful. You never know
what those extremist are going to
try next.”

“Yes ma'am.” I had to agree with
that.

“What can we do?” I asked an-
xiously.

“The petition! Start with the pe-
tition! MAMA loves you young men.
The Daughters of the Confederacy—
that’s one of our parent organiza-
tions—endorses this petition fully.
Also the Children of the Confeder-
acy.

“And—this is strictly confidential—
the Knights of the White Camelia
are 100 per cent behind this! They
consider our petition fully as im-
portant as the petition to reverse
the decision of the Scopes Trial.”

I snapped to attention. “My great-
grandfather was a Knight of the
White Camelia! If the Knights are
behind it it can't be wrong.” I
headed up to the Paramount to find
some membres of the Mongolian
Twinks. I mean Finks. 1 knew they'd
sign.

Student Says Hollins Girls
Ask For It: Stud Image Is
Demanded By Party Girls

To the Editor:
Dear Miss Doughty,

Surprise! We knew it all along,
Yes, we realize that we conform to
the image. We realize that we are
knaves.

What we never suspected was that
you Hollins girls might be so dif-
ferent. If, as you say, “fewer upper-
classmen at Hollins are exemplifying
the aimless party-girl mystique,”
then the ones who are left must be
intensifying their activities

As you say, the sensitive and in-
telligent young man who enters
Washington and Lee (without excep-
tion) is soon overwhelmed and re-
molded into the stud image. How-
ever, let me point out that one of
the main forces in this process is
the opinion of the girls the sensitive
and intelligent young man meets. It
is the girls who demand the stud
image. They get it.

If a Hollins girl had a date with
one of the sensitive and intelligent
young men you mention, you know
what she’d do. Sure. She’d dump
all over him. She would make her
“inordinate availability” available to
the biggest stud she could find.

Because Hollins girls are really
cool. Just like all the other girls
from all the other women’s colleges
around here. Cool, just like all the
men from all the men’s schools.

But, nevertheless, Miss Doughty, I
see a ray of hope for all you Hol-
lins girls who “are demanding a
wholesome and creative way of life.”
Me. Yes, me. Actually I'm probably
the only guy at W&L who has not
been overwhelmed by the fraternity
system and the stud image. I never
had a chance with the stud image.
So I'm still sensitive and intelligent.

Why don’t you send me the names
of some of these girls who have “re-
treated to more genuinely satisfying
pursuits.” Because so have I. And
maybe we could do our homework
together or something.

Alumnus says Integration
At W@L Insane; Disagrees
With Statement By Kulp

To the Editor:

I am opposed to negro integra-
tion at W&L. “Civil Rights” do not
include having a negro in the next
bunk at Freshman Camp, in the next
room in the dormitory, in th next
chair at the Freshman Dining Hall,
or having the next dance with my
date at a dance.

W&L is a private institution. No-
body is told to buy the “product” by
advertising or selling. It is imprac-
tical, insane and ridiculous to have
one or a few negroes in a student
body as tightly knit as W&L’s.

I object to the following statement
attributed to Jim Kulp, Student
Body President, quoted from the
Oct. 30 Ring-tum Phi:

“In reference to the integration
statement, he (Kulp) stated that
the students must aid in the imple-
mentation of the integration pol-
icy, no matter what the individual's
personal feeling were.”

This is still a free country and
any student who does not believe in
integration DOES NOT HAVE TO
AID IN THE IMPLEMENTATION
OF THIS INTEGRATION.

Wigert Replies to “Lamb”
Column; Betas Refuse
Cassius Clay Award

To the Editer:

In response to the witless attacks
of an article “Lamchopped Awards”
in the Tuesday edition of the Ring-
tum Phi, the Beta house would like
to state at this time its sincere be-
lief that the article was not written
by Lamar Lamb but was actually
intended as a clever and vicious as-
sault on his intelligence and in-
tegrity .

By writing something that would
obviously be accepted as the work
of a petty fool and then attributing
it to the unfortunate Lamb, the real
author has undoubtedly attempted
to slander Lamar more maliciously
than his piece has slandered certain
institulions and personalities of our
University.

Therefore, for the bitier and ap-
parently unmotivated slash at our
fraternity, the Betas hold to blame
not Lamar but the small-minded
individual who signed Lamar’s namy

The Washington and Lee
soccer team is now officially
the second best college soccer
team in the United States, The
national soccer association di-

vides the good soccer teams in- |
to two classifications, universities
and colleges. Washington and Lee
is considered a college for these
tournaments because of its size.

Four teams were chosen for the
tournament, the choosing being done

After holding onto a slim 14-13 lead throughout the second

Elected As Grid Captains

In Saturday's post-game football
meeting, captains for the 1965 edi-
tion of the Generals were elected.
Two linemen and a back were chosen
as Tri-Captains for next season. Two
Delts, Billy Andrews and Joe Miller,
and a KA, Jeff Novinger, will lead
the Generals.

Andrews, a scatback from Roa-
noke, Virginia, has been a standout
defensively this year in his safety
position. From Nashville, Tennessee,
| Miller ha seen action since his soph-
omore year at both offensive guard)
‘and defensive linebacker. Another |

linebacker from Tennessee, Novin-|
ger, has sparkled in his first year of

‘dent plays the pivot position on
offense and backs up the line on de-
fense.

One time Ed saved this student's

gotten his coat caught in the fer-

his plan before the student body for
a vote, the proposal will be prepared
as a constitutional amendment.

Nation’s plan provides for a free
system of primaries which would re-
move political control from any party
organization and place the elections
completely in the hands of the stu-
dent body as a whole.

Nation himself has stated that he
is not as much concerned with the
adoption of his plan as he is that
'his presentation of a plan will stir

After a week’s absence from con-
troversial “columnizing’—I _ slept
through last week’s meeting—it’s
time again to review the significant
and and sometimes not  ossignifi-
cant, events of the IFC

First a note to students interested
in participating. Yes, there is an
opportunity to participate in IFC
sponsored activities. You may ex-
press your praise, concern, or criti-
cism through your IFC member.

These committee represent a
cross-section of activity. The Social
Committee is headed by Ed Allen;
Chuck Griffin is chairman of the
popular Bus Committee. Roger Mi-
lam is head of the Charity Commit-
tee. Blaine Brownell is chairman of
Contact. Geoff Butler is chairman of
Town Relations Committee. And
Brooks Brown and Paton Adams
are chairmen of Financial and Con-
stitutional Committees respectively.

If you have an idea, why not ex-
press it to one of these committee
chairmen. No doubt they will appre-
ciate your interest. For example,
last night members discussed the
possibility for sponsoring an IFC
float in the Lexington Christmas

IFC Names Committee Chairmen

Parade. If you have an idea, or
wish to help in construction, con-
tact Geoff Butler, town relation
chairman.

For all those students and even
faculty members who find Lexington
a last outpost for cultural exper-
ience, the IFC has established an
intercollegiate calendar, which can
be found on the IFC bulletin board
in the student union. The calendar
wil lannounce coming events in the
cultural, social, and athletic realms
on such campuses as W&L, UVa.,
Randolph-Macon, Hollins, Sweet
Briar, and Mary Baldwin.

Those fraternities remaining with
outstanding financial statements are
as follows: Delta Tau Delta; Delta
Upsilon; Kappa Alpha; Kappa Sig-
ma; Phi Kappa Psi; Phi Kappa Sig-
Ma; Sigma Nu; Phi Epsilon Pi; Pi
Kappa Alpha; and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon.
