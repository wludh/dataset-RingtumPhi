English Seminar

Features Poet,

Miller Williams

By PETER WITT
“Poetry for the Non-Poetry
Reader” was the subject of the
fiftieth Washington and Lee
Lee Seminar in Literature con-

ducted last night by Miller

Williams, poet and member of
the English faculty at Louisiana State
University.

Williams’ own title for the talk was
“Nobody here plays the piano, but we
like to have it in the house.” He sug-
gested that poetry has become to most
people a useless ornament similar to

oo in the living room which no- Py. Miller Williams talks with students after his lecture Monday

play.
Get a Radio

“Poetry has been an ornament so
long that we no longer understand it,”
he said. Continuing the comparison
with the piano, he said people ought to
either “trade the piano for a radio,”
or learn to play it.

From infancy children are hindered
from appreciating poetry, said Wil-
liams. “We cripple the poet and the
child” when we teach them to expect
answers to all the questions. Teach-
ers and textbooks, the poet said, teach
only literature with “morals to them,”
literature which must be acceptable to
the “Daughters of Everything.”

Neatnik Poems

This type of literature Williams
characterized by the “Neatnik” poems
which are counterfeit with rhythm and
rhymes and a ribbon of sweetness, and
have a label which says, “Caution
contains truth.”

Mr. Williams characterized failings
in poetry which prevent people from
understanding good poetry when they
see it. The first failing he singled out
was sentimentalism, which tries to
make the shallow important.

“Push-Button Poetry”

“Push-button emotionalism” is the
use of worn-out phrases which im-
mediately call up a worn-out response
from the reader. Mr. Williams gave
several examples of “grotesques,”
which is his term for a type of bad
metaphor. The grotesque is something
which “if you painted they wouldn't
let you hang.”

At the end of his lecture Mr. Wil-
liams answered questions from the
audience. The seminar was followed
by coffee in duPont Hall, outside the
auditorium.

Williams has been awarded a Bread
Loaf Fellowship in poetry and received
the Amy Lowell Travelling Scholar-
ship for 1963-64. He has recently pub-
lished the first volume of his poetry,
which has appeared in many literary
magazines including the W&L review,
Shenandoah.

Notice

The Executive Committee of the
Faculty has set a two-day limit as
the maximum time allowed any stu-
dent wishing to leave school for
work before the Christmas holidays.
The student must be in attendance at
classes on the day before he leaves
to accept employment

Mock Trial

Washington and Lee University
law students took over Rockbridge
County’s court room today to stage
the School of Law’s annual mock
trial.

Student lawyers will argue a
complicated civil case before Judge
Jack M. Matthews of Virginia's 21st
Judicial Circuit, which includes
Grayson, Wythe, Pulaski, and Car-
roll counties.

Judge Matthews’ participation
marks the first time in recent years
that a judge, and not a law pro-
fessor, has heard the mock trial
case.

Another innovation this year will
be the 12-member jury panel made
up of Lexington townspeople, instead
of other law students.

Law senior Jim Bowie of Galax,
mock trial chairman, hopes the lay
jury will render a more impartial
verdict than has come from student
juries in the past. “Law students on
the jury tend to evaluate the case
in terms of what they know or think
they know about the law,” he ex-
plains. “A jury of laymen will offer
a more realistic viewpoint.”

Because the mock trial is expect-
ed to draw a number of spectators,
its location has been shifted from
the customary moot court facilities
of Washington and Lee's Tucker Hall
to the main court room at the Rock-
bridge County Court House.

The case involves an action for
property damage and personal in-
jury arising from an accident caused
by a farm animal that strayed onto
the highway. It is similar to an ac-
tual case recently heard in Halifax
County Cireuit Court, Bowie says.

Arguments for both sides will be
| handled by teams of three student
| lawyers each.

 

| Chief defense counsel is John L.!

| Kowalski, Jr. of North Falmouth,
| Mass. He will be assisted by Sam-
i uel W. Coleman, Hl, of Gate City
land Rudolph Bumgardner, It, of
| Staunton.

| Chief counsel for the plaintiff is
| Philip H. Shafer of Middlefield,

Baremore Is Outstanding Debater
At American University Tourney

A strong showing at a tournament
at American University this past
weekend highlighted an active week
for the Washington and Lee debate
team.

Tom Baremore, a W&L freshman
was chosen as the fourth best speak-
er out of sixty in the Delta Sig-
ma Rho-Tau Kappa Alpha tourney
and also won the award for the top
negative speaker. Sam Frazier placed
third in the After-Dinner Speaker
Contest, part of the same tournament
held on the campus of American
University in Washington, D.C

The four man W&L team consist-
ing of Baremore, Frazier, Bill Grant
and Hal Hiegenbottem, won four
debates in the team competition
while losing the same number

Washington and Lee played host
te four nevice teams in the area last
Wednesday in regional novice
tournament. Teams from Bridge-

a

| water, Randolph-Macon College,
end VPI competed with W&L in
i three rounds of debate. Washington
and Lee novice debaters who took
part in the tournament were Bob
Imholt, Steve Meidner, Bill Tim-
merman and Bob Cogan. The team
from Roanoke College won the
tournament

Next week will again be a busy
week for the W&L varsity team
On Wednesday, Ed Fitzgerald, Kaz
Herchold, John McMurry, and Dave
Marchese will put on a debate ex-
hibition at a high school in Roanoke
Several rounds of practice debate
will be held here next Thurs-
day aainst sixteen debaters from

Each team of lawyers has been as-
sisted by four research men in pre-
paring arguments.

Witnesses testifying in the case
will be twelve law students and
one wife of a law student.

Bowie says the mock trial offers
valuable court room experience to
participants that is unavailable in
the law classrooms. The mock trial
is classified as a student extra-cur-
ricular activity, but it receives full
backing of the university's law facul-
ty, Bowie adds.

 

Troubadours
Will Present
‘The Merchant’

By KIP ARMSTRONG

At 8:15 Wednesday night the cur-
tains of the Troubadour Theater will
open on the first play of the 1964-65
season, Shakespeare’s most outstand-
ing romantic comedy, The Merchant
of Venice.

Lew Davis, the former comedian,
will play the enigmatic character
of Shylock. Portia, another of
Shakespeare’s eternal creations, will
be played by Mrs. Martha Evans.

Pete Stelling and Charles Bright
complete the cast as Antonio and
Bassanio.

The extensive and rather “extrav-
agant” sets designed by Gay Reading
should go far to create the appro-
priate atmosphere. The entire pro-
duction is decidecated to the 400th an-
iversary of the birth of Shakespeare.

Also of interest will be the treat-
ment of the contrasting worlds of
Vience and Belmont. A decidedly
different atmosphere surrounds each
of them. Belmont supports a theme
of romance and joy, while Venice,
the site of an attempted murder, is
ruled by money and prejudice.

The Trowbadours have spared no
effort in making this production
worthy of the significant occasion.
For reservations through Saturday
night call the box office at 463-2181,
ext. 273.

The supporting cast includes many
veterans of past Troubadour pro-
ductions. Lock Handley has one of
the most important of the supporting
parts as Launcelot Gobbo, the fool.
Dr. Keith Shillington is playing the
part of Tubal, friend of Shylock.

Last year, the Troubadours pre-
sented Marlow’s “Faustus” in com-
memoration of his 400 anniversary.

 

Mayfield, Saunders Appointed

Interim Convention Chairmen

The Executive Committee announc-! tional Committee be set up with a

ed last night the appointment of David
Mayfield, sophomore from Durham,
N.C., and Steve Saunders, freshman
from Elmont,, New York, as the Co-
Chairmen of the Mock Convention
Coordinating Committee.

President Jim Kulp stated that the
committee was formed to meet two
immediate problems which require
long range planning. According to
Kulp the committee will be respon-
sible for taking the necesary steps to
obtain a ruling from the Internal Rev-
enue Service to make tax deductable
all donations to the Mock Convention.
In addition the committee will set up

Saunders

a permanent location for all records
and materials concerning the plan-
ning and organizing of the Mock Con-
vention

In an interview with the ELC.
Mayfield suggested the possibility of
a national advisory board composed
of key members of the Republican
Party to work with the Coordinating
Committee over the next three years.
In this way Mayfield felt that the
Mock Convention would receive a
great more support from the leaders
of the party and at the same time
benefit from their extensive knowl-
edge.

Steve Saunders stated in his inter-

 

view with the E.C. that an organiza- |
tion similar to the Republican Na-'

number of regional representatives
who would familiarize themselves with
the political “pulse” of these areas
over the next three years in order to
insure accuracy in the 1968 Conven-
tion.

As a member of the 1964 Mock
Convention Secretariat, Mayfield was
assistant to the publicity chairman. He
is also on the Dance Board Advisory
Committee, assistant to the editor of

 

the Ring-tum Phi, and a particiipant

Fiftieth Anniversary For
ODK Tapping Assembly

By FRANK L, FAIRCHILD, JR.
Dr. Samuel Reid Spencer, Jr., President of Mary Bald-

win College, has been selected t

ODK Tapping Assembly. The

o speak at the 50th Anniversary
assembly will be held December

Bean To Address
Civil War Club

“Robert E. Lee and the Battle of
Seven Pines” will be the subject of the
meeting of the Washington and Lee
Civil War Round Table scheduled for
Thursday evening, November 19. Dr.
William G, Bean, profesor of history
emeritus, will be guest speaker, ac-
cording to program chairman Steve
Saunders. Second in a projected series
of eight programs, the Thursday night
meeting will be conducted in duPont
105 beginning at 7:30 p.m.

Bean War Expert

Dr. William G. Bean served as head
of the history department from 1930
until his retirement in June 1962. He
had come to Washington and Lee as
an assistant professor in 1922. One of
the foremost authorities on the Civil
War, Dr. Bean is a member of the Vir-
ginia Civil War Commission’s Execu-
tive Committee.

He is a member of the Southern
Historical Asociation and the Virginia
Historical Society, and has written
articles for the South Atlantic Quar-
terly, the New England Quarterly, the
Virginia Magazine of History and
Biography, and the Journal of South-
ern History. In 1959, his most recent
book was published, Stonewall’s Man:
Sandie Pendleton.

Dr. Bean received his A.B. at the
University of Alabama, and both his
M.A. and Ph.D. at Harvard Univer-
sity.

General Robert E. Lee took com-
mand of the Confederate forces at the
Battle of Seven Pines in 1862, and pro-
vided the vigorous leadership which
had only been sporadic previously. For
this reason, Seven Pines is especially
significant. Dr. Bean's treatment of
the battle is expected to be both in-
teresting and enlightening. Students
and faculty are welcome to attend. A
question-and-answer period will fol-
low Dr. Bean's talk.

Dr. Charles Turner

W&L’'s Civil War Round Table was
formed at the ebginning of this semes-
ter. Dr. Charles W. Turner, professor
of History, is faculty advisor.

 

SPE Wins

Lee Chapel saw the return of the
Interfraternity Song Fest to the
Washington and Lee campus last
night. The program, beginning at
8:30, found four fraternities, SPE, |
Sigma Chi, Pi Phi and Lambda’
Chi, teking part in the competition.

* Dr. Spencer, described as a dy-
namic orator, received his A.B. de-
gree from Davidson College in 1940.
Graduating summa cum laude, he
later attended Harvard University
where he earned his M.A., and Ph.D.
degrees. After a brief association
with Vick Chemical Co. and Green-
ville Clark Co. he returned to
Davidson in 1951 to become assist-
ant to the President. He was subse-
quently made Professor of History
and Dean of Students. Leaving
Davidson in 1957, he assumed the
Presidency of Mary Baldwin College.

While studying at Harvard, Dr.
Spencer received an Austin Fel-
lowship, a Rosenwald Fellowship
and a Kent Fellowship from the
National Council on Religion in
Higher Education. A member of
Phi Beta Kappa, Dr. Spencer has
written several books, including
Decision for War 1917 and Booker
T. Washington and the Negro
Place in American Life. He wes
initiated into ODK twenty-five
years ago in Lee Chapel in a spec-
ial service commemorating the
25th anniversary of the leadership
fraternity.

Concerning the selection of Dr.
Spencer as a speaker for the Anni-
versary Assembly, ODK President
Steve Smith commented, “It is very
appropriate that we will be hearing
the President of a neighboring in-
stitution, since W&L students have
little contact with these schools ex-
cept on a very informal social level.”

The assembly will be the fiftieth
in which ODK has chosen members
from the student body, and facul-
ty. The Chapter also expects to tap
an unusually large number of alum-
ni this year in view of the signi-
ficance of the anniversary celebra-
tion.

Omicron Delta Kappa is an honor-
ary leadership fraternity founded at
Washington and Lee in 1914 for the
purpose of “bringing together cam-
pus leaders in a more relaxed at-
mosphere. Dr. Rupert Latture, re-
tired political science professor, was
one of the founders. In the past fifty
years chapters or circles have been
established in more than one hun-
dred colleges and universities located

THE RING-TUM PHI

Tuesday Edition

Washington, And Lee

The self-analysis which is being conducted by Wash-
ington and Lee this year has as one of its objects of study
the proposed separation of this university into a Washing-
ton College and Lee College. Certainly one of the most
perplexing problems raised by the proposed halving, and
one which should be thoroughly examined by the self-
study group, is the effect which the separation into two col-
leges would have on the character of the student body.

The outstanding characteristic of Washington and Lee
is the body of tradition which has been carefully given and
no less carefully preserved for many student generations.
If Washington College and Lee College were to be twin in-
stitutions, offspring of the present university, they should
naturally be possessed by the same heritage. If we did not
believe this, then we would not believe our traditions are
suitable for preservation in the school as we now have it.
But what would be the effect of transplanting the honor
system to the new college: Can a good honor system be
transplanted at all?

The W&L honor system was not actually “started” at
any one point. It grew and was given form only very grad-
ually. The new college would immediately face the prob-
lem of initiating an honor system from scratch without the
reality of tradition which the present system enjoys.

To transplant tradition to the new college, the univer-
sity would have to transplant a large number of students
from the old Washington and Lee. Tradition cannot be
handed to freshmen without the example of upperclass-
men who can say about the honor system, “Yes, it really
works”; who are there to make it work. But probably
this is the method contemplated by the proponents of the
two-college plan. If so, the problem becomes this: Who
will transfer to the new college? The university would have
to ensure a representative transfer of students, and not al-
low only those students to make the change who have
nothing to give up by a change. A lack of upper-
classmen capable of passing on the honor system would
probably be fatal to it.

Paradoxically, the effect of the separation on tradi-
tions other than the honor system would almost certainly
be invigorating. The experience of most new schools has
been an unusual friendliness which would give a new life
to the speaking tradition. The common bond of a new
adventure should also be in itself the most powerful en-
forcer of conventional dress. But these traditions, though
important, are matters of conformity in outward appear-
ance. The honor system, a moral concern, is something
entirely different. It is, of course, entirely a student matter
insofar as its administration is concerned, But it would
be a mistake for the university to ignore the effects which
such a move as the proposed split would have on the honor
system. A continuum of student tradition may in the lang
run be fully as important as the obligation to the future
which is the reason for considering expansion.

Besides effects on the usually recognized traditions, the
results of separation on the fraternity system are worth
consideration. It is possible that the administration would
seize the moment of transition to abolish fraternities at
both schools. But if the fraternity system at the time is
healthy and receives support from alumni, the most likely
event is that the entire system would be transferred to
the new college. It would be unfortunate if the old stu-
dent body retained a fraternity system and the new col-
lege had none; the result would be two completely dif.
ferent student bodies, with a minimum of things in com-
mon, and perhaps with antipathy toward each other.
The situation would attract different types of applicants
for each college, and would build different types of men
during the college years. It would hinder an effective
intercourse between the two schools, On the other hand,
if the existing W&L fraternity chapters were allowed
to establish chapters on the new campus, a means of con-
stant intercourse would be provided instantly. Such an
exchange would help the new college develop the tradi-
tions which make Washington and Lee a distinctive insti-
tution, and would also help entering classes over some of
the problems which beset any new college students.

We are playing the devil’s advocate in this editorial
because we are frankly skeptical of the Washington-Lee
Colleges idea. Even more than we dislike the snug and
smug comfort of our sheltered community, we fear the
possibility of turning Washington and Lee upside down.
As much as we recognize the university's responsibility
to the multiplying numbers of high school graduates seek-
ing college education, we believe that this responsibility
stops short of dissolving the distinctions which makes
Washington and Lee a great school. The plans may be dis-
tant in the future but consideration of student traditions is
not academic merely for this reason. Instead, this consider-
ation ought to be part of any plans which are made, along
with or even before those of where to build the buildings
and where to get the money. The plan for separate
colleges under one administration has succeeded else-
where, and perhaps it can succeed here; perhaps we are
obligated to enlarge the university's capacity, But in an
expansion, we hope the heritage which makes W&L
worth doubling will not be weakened.

 

 

  
   
       

  

Tired of the usual classical mu-
sic presented nightly by Radio
Washington and Lee? (If you listen
at all.) In a recent, candid inter-
view with Messrs. Ell Betts and
Tim Crowley, your reporter ex-
plored the how, why, and what
that surrounds Radio W&L’s new
weekly radio program: “The World
on Tap.”

R-tP: I wonder if you can tell me,
gentlemen, just what exactly is
“The World on Tap?” In _ other
words, what makes it distinctive
from the other programs presented
on Radio W&L?

Betts: Well, let me say first of all
that that was a mighty stupid ques-
tion, but since you asked it, I guess
I might as well go ahead and an-
swer it. I'd say that the “The World
on Tap” is completely different.
There is one similarity, however.

R-tP: Oh? What’s that?

Crowley: Nobody knows we're on
the air but our mothers.

Betts: But that doesn’t make too
much difference because reception
gets kind of fuzzy past the Liquid.

R-tP: Say, Mr> Betts, I notice that
you speak with somewhat of a drawl.
You wouldn’t be from Texas, would
you?

Betts: Yeah. Say, I notice that you
talk with a rather pronounced speech
defect. You wouldn’t be from the
Ring-tum Phi, would you?

Some “Mighty Stupid Questions”

 

Paper Attempts to Interview
‘Radio W&L’ Comedy Team

By Charles Newman

R-tP: Tell me. How did you come
to produce the “World on Tap”
series?

Betts: Well, first we came to Reid
Hall. Then we went into the first
fioor and looked around for the
radio studio. It wasn’t there.

Crowley: Then we went up to the
second floor and looked for the radio
studio. It wasn’t there either.

R-tP: Seriously now, what in-
spires you to produce this program?

Crowley: You might say we enjoy
laughing at everything sacro-sanct
in the world.

Betts: We satirize anything that’s
current. TV shows commercials,
heads of state, political institutions,
and even everyday situations, plus
occasional interviews with interest-
ing personalities such as Yokohama
Nagasaki, the world famous karate
expert.

R-tP: About how long does each
show last?

Crowley: We're on from 8:05 ‘ul
8:20 every Wednesday night.
ult-tP: And how long does it take
you to compose these programs?

Betts: Oh, anywhere from five to
ten minutes. Of course sometimes
it takes even longer.

R-tP: How large do you estimate
your listening audience to be?

Crowley: About two-hundred
thousand, I guess.

R-tP: Two hundred thousand!

Why that’s amazing!

_ You're pretty amazing your-
seu.
R-tP: Say. I notice that the two of
you are wearing costumes—for ex-
ample that rabbit suit Mr. Crowley
has on. Do you wear these get-ups
when you record your show?

Crowley: Yes. You see, Ell and I
take every role in skits that we do.
We have to portray so many differ-
ent characters that it helps us in
our interpretations if we appear
physically the way we want to sound
to our listeners.

Betts: Don’t you believe him. He
wears that rabbit suit wherever he

goes.
...R-tP: But doesn’t he get assimil-
ated walking around the campus?

Betts: No, man. As long as he’s
got on a tie they can’t touch him.

R-tP: And Mr. Betts, you're
dressed up like a cowboy, I suppose,
with your boots, hat and gun.

Betts: Of course. That’s what I
want to be if I ever grow up.

Crowley: Yeah. And I want to be
a big rabbit when I grow up.

R-tP: But doesn’t it bother you
to live such uninhibited, insincere
lives?

Betts: No. Not in the least. The
day we start taking things seriously
is the day Tim takes off his rabbit
suit.

A Look At Quiet Desperation

 

Finny Praised For ‘Saturday Night’

By WARD BRIGGS
Cinema Columnist

“I am what I am and anybody who
tries to say what I am is a bloody
liar. Only God knows what I am.”
This is the philos-
ophy of Arthur
Seaton as por-
trayed by Albert
_ Finny in “Satur-
' day Night and
Sunday morning”
which played yes-
terday at the Ly-
ric. This was Fin-
ney’s first catapult
ts Hes
brought his sul-
len frown, his
transfixing smile, and his penetrat-
ing gaze to the attention of the inter-
national film audience. He has a fan-
tastie presence on the screen which
comes close to that of Marcello Mas-
troianni in standing at the very
heart of every scene, and making
you constantly aware of this mag-
netic individuality. He superbly
mimics the bourgeois factory work-
ers of modern England, in this
bourgeois protest directed by Karl
Reisz and produced by Tony Rich-
ardson.

Arthur is symbol of quite despera-
tion of the British factory worker

Briggs

who works in the shop for five days
a week and goes to the local pubs
on the weekend. His weekends are
filled with fighting, fishing and a lot
of drinking, leading only to the
dreary Monday morning when he
must return to work. In the shop,
the tools form a contant drone which
is constantly brought to mind when
cars pass in a busy street or a trash
can lid falls. Chained to his job,
Arthur never has hope for advance-
ment and seeks his release by plunk-
ing his neighbor with a BB gun.

Arthur is like a conglomeration of
many small pits with trap doors,
waiting to devour any experience
that befalls him. Every trap door is
constantly open, and with every ex-
perience, getting his friend's wife
pregnant, or getting beaten nearly
to a pulp, Arthur delights in the liv-
ing of life until he faces the threat
of being cramped. The baby looms
as a horrible spectre in his mind
and he abandons the adultress
(Rachel Roberts). After getting
beaten up, he seeks solace from his
girl-friend (Shirley Anne Field)
closing out that part of the world
responsible for his beating (the
cuckolded husband). As he says,
“I'm out for a good time, all the
rest is propaganda.”

Like too few British movies, this

one overcomes several problems of
making movies in England. Those
who wish to make good, intelligent
movies are often plagued by the
economic instabilities of high pro-
duction costs, and lack of actual
fervor and creative interest. In
Britain the film temperature is com-
paratively low as compared to France
and Italy, where films are an accept-
ed art form. In these countries,
novelists, playwrights and scenarists
switch back and forth from one
medium to another without criticism.

Yet with the exception of John
Osborne and a few others, this is
not true in England. British movies
seem to be far too involuted and
distant from the outside world, as
detached from the continental flics
as they tried to be from continental
politics. British audiences feel that
the only wohthwhile novels are
those made in their country, for
only those delve into the true prob-
lems of the world, those of Britain.

“Saturday Nite” has a touch of
this, but the magic of Finney’s act-
ing gives greater depth and authen-
ticity to the movie and in the end
we are left with the epitome of his
philosophy: “Just because I don’t
live like you, don't think that I

Burch’s Concept
Of GOP Victory
Called Pyhrric

By STEVE SAUNDERS

In the wake of the Republican dis-
aster on November 3, a number of
GOP leaders have taken to that
brand of optimism which sees victory
in defeat and regeneration in degen-
eration. Not least among these hardy
prophets of The Greater Meaning is
the chairman of the Republican Na-
tional Committee, Dean Burch.
Viewing the lop-sided returns, Burch
cheerfully observed in his own in-
imitable way that the election sig-
naled the emergence of a two-party
system in the South and a “victory
for conservatism.”

Chairman Burch’s sense of pro-
portion is questionable. He puts us
in mind of the words of the Greek
general, Pyhrrus, after an especial-
ly costly battle: “Another such vic-
tory, and we are undone.” If Burch
is allowed to continue planning such
“victories for conservatism,” the Re-
publican party might very well go
the way of the Populist, Socialist
Democratic, and Roosevelt Progres-
sive parties. These parties cam-
paigned not so much to win as to
reduce the plurality of the opposi-
tion. If Burch’s inept leadership con-
tinues, the Republican party will
have as its chief purpose the reduc-
tion of Democratic victory margins
“victories for for conservatism.”

New Jersey Loss

Of what do these “victories” con-
sist? Bureh points with pride to
the election of a Republican con-
gressman in Mississippi. But what
of the loss of control of the New
Jersey Congressional delegation to
the Democrats for the first time in
history. This “voctory” Mr. Burch
doesn’t mention. The defection of
Georgia from the Democratic column
for the first time in history is a
source of great conservative joy.
However, Mr. Burch overlooks the
fact that Vermont went Democratic
for the first also.

Burch waxes eloquent on the
Murphy win in the California sen-
atorial race, but what does he have
to say about the senatorial cam-
paigns in New York, or Ohio? He is
ecstatic over Republican Daniel J.
Evan’s. victory over incumbent
Washington Governor Albert
(“Rosy”) Rossellini, a Democrat. The
defeat of Goldwater-aide Richard
Kleindeinst in Arizona does not ex-
cite the same effusiveness.

Burch thinks, to be sure, in terms
of Greater Meaning Of It All.
Twenty-five million votes, consider-
ed per se, is an impressive number
of citizens opting for Goldwater
conservatism. When considered,
though, next to Johnson's thirty-
eight million votes, it is puny. But
it is a victory for conservatism, we
are assured.

The full impact of the Democratic
sweep cannot be felt until one looks
at the local and state elections. And
this is where Burch’'s “victories”
hurt the Republican party most.
New York's legislature, Republican
for 28 years, went Democratic. Six-
seven-, eight-, and nine-term Rep-
resentatives were defeated through-
out the Northeast by political neo-
phytes. Young beat Taft, Kerner
beat Percy, and in Oklahoma, State
Senator Fred Harris trounced Re-
publican Bud Wilkinson, who had
been favored to win. Thanks to
Burch's “victories for conservatism,”
the Republicans are now the weak-
est “major” party since the Whigs.

Grenier Due Credit

It can't all be blamed on Burch.
John Grenier, erstwhile Alabama
GOP leader, can be credited with
urging the expenditure of fantastic
amounts of money on local congres-
sional and state-wide races in Ala-
bama, Florida, Mississippi, Louis-
jana, South Carolina, and George.
As one of Burch's top staffers, Gren-
ier channeld streams of money to
Republican office-seekers in these
states, reducing the funds for East-
ern and Midwestern candidates to
a trickle. Pennsylvania's peppery Re-
publican Senator Hugh Scott felt
the bind, and was the first to ac-
cuse the national committee of dis-
criminating against Eastern candi-
dates by withholding money. Seott
cried foul and Burch pleaded econ-
omy. A “victory” for sound finance,
no doubt.

If ever a Republican national
chairman deserved to be removed,
Dean Burch is that man. When the
National Committee meets on Jan-
uary 10, it would be well-advised to
remove Burch and clear out his
“vietory”-minded crew. Idaho Gov-
ernor Smylie would make an ex-
cellent chairman; he is personable,
capable, a militant moderate, and—
hopefully—acceptable to both lib-
erals and conservatives.

Burch’'s imposed leadership of the
National Committee has been repu-
diated in dozens of state, in thou-
sands of precinets, and by millions

Generals Blank Lynx For Third Straight
Booters Place 2nd In State; ‘Record Now 8-2-1

Kickers Prepare
For NCAA Play

By BOB CARTER
Tuesday Sports Writer

Washington and Lee’s soccer team
defeated Randolph-Macon, 3-2, and
tied the University of Virginia, 2-2,
to gain a second place finish in
the Virginia Intercollegiate Soccer
Tournament held at Lynchburg Col-
lege on Saturday.

The Generals gained an opening
round bye because of their second
place seeding behind the University
of Virginia. In the semifinals the
Generals were able to turn back
Randolph-Macon with a strong of -
fensive show and an alert defense,
Center forward Tim Henry and left
inside Dave Kirkpatrick each scored
a goal in the second quarter while
wing Wes Horner tallied the last
W&L goal in the fourth quarter.

Cavaliers Win Tourney
Although Washington and Lee
tied UVa., the Cavaliers won the
tournament on the number of corner
kicks by an advantage of 7-4. The
Generals led the Cavaliers 2-0 at
the end of the first quarter, but the

Generals simply ran out of steam*

Goals by Tim Henry and win Wes
Horner gave the Generals the 2-0
advantage but Virginia bounced back
and scored in ‘the second and third
quarters.

The Cavaliers controlled the game
and were much better rested than
the Generals who had only an
hour’s rest between the semi-finals
and the finals. The Generals simp-
ly did not have enough energy left
to keep up with the well-rested Cav-
aliers.

Booters Record Now 8-2-1

Washington and Lee finished the
regular season with a record of
8-2-1, the best in the school’s his-
tory. Dave Redmond was named the
outstanding defensive player in the
tournament and Wolfe of Randolph-
Macon the outstanding offensive
player.

 

Dave Redmond, W&L’s candidate
for a fullback spot on the All-Amer-
ica team, was outstanding in this
tourney and as mentioned before,
was noted as the best defensive back.
Tim Henry was also lauded for his
offensive work as this center for-
ward led the Generals in scoring
during the regular season.

The W&L defensive unit played its
usual fine game throughout the tour-
nament with goalie Bob Larus mak-
ing numerous saves. The Generals
leave for Tufts College Noc. 18 to
play in the Eastern division of the

NCAA Playoffs.

Harriers Down
Fairmont, 19-44

By ROGER MILAN
Tuesday Sports Writer

Saturday afternoon, Washington
and Lee’s cross-country team con-
tinued to stay in the winner's col-
umn as they defeated Fairmont
College, 19-44.

The Generals took all but second
place out of the first seven. Fresh-
man George Parker took first place
finishing the 4.1 mile course in 24
minutes, 21 seconds.

Harriers Race Highpoint Next

Next Saturday at 2:45, the harriers
close the season with Highpoint Col-
lege. This year’s team has been not
only a tremendous success but also
a great improvement over past teams
at W&L as they finished third in the
state meet.

A particular highlight of the meet!

was the fact that only one minute!
separated the first and seventh men.
Lee Johnson placed third for the}
Generals with a time of 24:33. Andy

| Kilpatrick and Rick O'Conner had

 

times 24:41 and 24:49 to place fourth
and fifth respectively.

To the Editor:

 

Having read Friday’s edition of the
Ring-tum Phi, I can see what Barry
Goldwater said about being misquot-
ed. The article containing the story
on combos is one which shows the
misinterpretation that can arise from
telephone canversations.

Thursday night I was contacted by
a columnist and asked to make a state-
ment. What appeared Friday does not
say what I said. The columnist said
that he thought that he had the gist
of what I had to say, I see now that
he did not.

First, all groups here have not been
booked by one agent. Many of them
are, perhaps a majority of them are
handled by one agency. True, many
have complained of the higher prices
of combos, but this complaint comes
from all quarters and is aimed at all
agents and combos. These gripes have
been mounting in the past years, es- |
pecially when the cost of fraternity |
social activities are topic of conver-

 

sation on the Hill or at the individu-
al’s home. As far as the bad service
is concerned, I said that I felt there)

could be changes in procedure. |

At the meeting today, Ted Hall, |
alone, came to represent his agency.
This seemed to indicate that he is |
more interested in social life at W&L
than his competitor: Spotlight Attrac- |
tions. What the above mentioned are |
ticle says about the latter’s selection |
of groups is correct (namely that they
have groups which other agencies do!
not), as is the statement that their
prices are lower. But, Spotlight has
quoted lower prices on which they are
unable to deliver. When confronted
with these prices, they denied them.
Ted Hall stood firm on all prices quot-
ed by himself in the past. This leads
myself as well as other social chair-
men to the opinion that Ted Hall is

amples of past trouble with groups
and told all present how to handle

late combos, drunk ones, combos
which did not bring all their members
and other questions. The fifinal im-
pression which I received was one
which one would have having seen
the past election’s results (with Ted
Hall as Johnson).

The meeting today answered many
questions in different social chairmen’s
minds and put Ted in the fore. Te also
quoted prices for the Dance Board
which are considerably lower than
those paid at present to Stan Rubin in
New York. I shall cite a few examples:
we paid Fats Domino $2100 three years
ago, Ted’s price $1250, we paid Bo
Diddley $1000, as opposed to $650, and
Hank Ballard and the Midnighters
$1500, to $950. These prices are con-
firmed and it seems to me that maybe
the Dance Board could make use of
these prices and save the school mony.

Finally, any doubts that myself or
anyone else may have had about Ted
Hall are gone. He has presented his
case and his opposition has not. He
has made himself a strong new tie
here and I think that the Dance Board
should make use of his service.

Sincerely,

ED ALLEN
IFC Social Chairman
