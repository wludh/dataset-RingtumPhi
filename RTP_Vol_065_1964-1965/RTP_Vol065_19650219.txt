Hinton

The Washington and Lee Self-
Study Program, subject of the ODK
Leadership Forum conducted Wed-
nesday night, was introduced by Dr.
William Hinton, chairman of the
study. Hinton opened his brief ex-
planation of the program by saying,
“The responsibility for this self-study
lies with the University. Unless
those involved receive full support
of the Washington and Lee Family,
the self-study will not be able to
fulfill the requirements of such an
analysis.”

The official reason for the study is
not only to fulfill the requirements
of the Southern Association of Col-
leges, but also to produce something
which will serve as a guide to a
productive future, he stated.

Hinton outlined the structure of
the self-study program, emphasiz-
ing the role of the steering com-

mittee into which he said other
committees would funnel their
findings. In getting everyone in-

volved in such a program, you
create a wide base of responsibility
and interfere less with the various
duties of the faculty and admin-
istration.

The st study will define the objec-

tives of the University—its philoso-
phy of education, its needs, and its
aims. Various members of the steer-
ing committee have drawn up state-
ments, tentative in nature, and sub-
ject to the revision of the commit-
tee as a whole.

The steering committee found it
necessary to set up several sub-
committees to deal with such facets
of the university as the honors
program, pre-medical curriculum,
grades (on this committee, Hinton
said, quite a bit of use had been
made of student opinion), leave of
absence policy, alumni evaluation of
a W&L edueation, and class sched-
uling. Hinton emphasized that the
faculty was in the same stage of
ignorance concerning the self-study
in late November as the student
body is now. He went on to say that
student involvement was less easily
obtained than faculty involvement.
More student involvement is needed,
he felt.

“If I’ve given you nothing but the
feel of the self-study, this meeting
has been successful. The self-study
goes beyond the requirements of
accreditation into the future of
W&L.” Hinton concluded before the

meeting was opened for questions
from the floor.

The first question to come up
concerned the place Lee College
was to fit into the self-study. Hin-
ton answered by saying that the
proposed extension didn’t come in-
to consideration at present; how-
ever, he did say that if the needs
are sufficient, they might suggest
expansion in such a direction.

in answering to questions con-
cerning the availability of the results
of the analysis, Hinton said that the
final draft would of course be avail-
able and that tentative results might
be discussed at some future meeting.

Dean W. W. Pusey, a member of
the steering committee, stated that
students would be brought into com-
mittees in areas where student opin-
ion is important. These committees
have not yet gotten underway.

It was brought out that both Dean
Atwood and President Cole have
had experience in compiling self-
studies at other schools in the past.

In answer to a question as to
whether any opinions of the sub-
committees had come in yet, Hin-
ton replied that there had been
few. Dr. Wise pointed out that such

 

tentative opinions might not neces-
sarily be open information.

Troubadour Review

By WILLIAM F. HANNUM, I

The Troubadour Theatre presentation of Henrik Ibsen's

vigorous positive response from its

audience. Such a response should be especially gratifying in light of
the fact that the play is difficult to wrest from its topical late 19th century

frame of reference. Dr. Cecil Jones, the Troubadours’

director, has clearly

succeeded in delivering the play of its explosive universal force, the ever-
lasting ironical conflict between different kinds of truth, without allow-

ing its Mid-Victorian socio-political

trappings to interfere.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Friday Edition

Administrative Responsibility

Administrative responsibility at neighboring girls’ schools
includes the behavior of girls’ dates and punishing any behavior
which that college regards as improper. In most cases, the ad-
ministrations themselves take action, they call in the police if
necessary, and finally report such misconduct to the respective
men’s schools, W&L, UVa., Hampden-Sydney, etc., for their

action.

However, the W&L administration seems to feel as though
we are all “Virginia gentlemen,” and that all students’ dates
are “Shenandoah belles.” Even if the girl is six-five, weighs
two-twenty, and is totally uncontrollable after one scotch and
water, it is the student’s responsibility to see that her ladyship
never misbehaves in public. So the girl, after knocking out a
few windows or charging down the street drunk or emerging
from the fraternity house like a modern Eve, misbehaves. It’s
not her fault; she’s a lady. Instead, the responsibility lies with
the man; he’s the villain. Girls are incapable of misbehaving
or of encouraging misbehavior. It is, however, the fraternity
that’s put on social probation; it’s the man who suffers. Not
that the W&L man is any Sir Philip Sidney, but the responsi-

bility is not his alone.

The point, though, is that the administration accepts no
responsibility for the conduct of girls who date at W&L on
weekends. When asked by an official of one our neighbor-

ing schools what would happen if one of their students was
found weaving up and down the street drunk at two in the*
morning, one of our administrative officers replied that the
case would not be reported to the girls’ school, nor would any
action other than possibly from the Lexington police force be

taken against the girl.

The responsibility for controlling his date’s conduct does:

lie with the boy, but sometimes the girls’ misbehavior is not his
fault. This must be taken into consideration. It is not always

the boy or the fraternity that should be punished.
It may be that one reason W&L is so much criticized is be-
cause W&L men are held responsible for both their dates

Beardslee Questions Fraternity S ystem

For the former there is a severe pen-

Faculty Stars
Clash With IM
Stars Monday

By TOM WHITE

On the theory ‘that you can’t lose
‘em all, the 1965 edition of the intra-
mural basketball all stars has be-
gun to practice for its meeting next
Monday night at 7:30 with the facul-
ty stars.

To refresh your memory just a bit,
the IM stars last year were humiliat-
ed by the faculty in a game where
the scorekeeper was pretty much on
his own. He introduced a_ helpful
rule wherein faculty baskets counted
twice as much as student baskets.
Naturally, no accurate record of the
score was kept.

Anyway, hope springs eternal in
the human breast and IM coach Gor-
don Gay reports an enthusiastic
bunch showed up for last night's
first practice session. The starting
line up is still not known on the
IM side. However, coach Gay has a
good selection to choose from.

Sixteen houses have already se-
lected their representatives for the
game (each house gets to pick one
of its IM players). At the time of
this writing the players were: Beta,
Tom Burton; Delt, Lindsey Short;
DU, Chuck Boggs; KA, Skip Chase;

—, Lambda Chi, Dick Drew; Phi Delt,

: . peers P ee g | Barry Crosby; Phi Ep, Brax Tabb;
Spring Football Practice Underway; 27 Lettermen > ‘irzeairgn Pees Be:

Among 58 Candidates For Varsity Squad Positions

Phi Gam, John Morgan; Phi Psi, Bob

Dick Bradford; Sigma Nu, Buck
Clement; SPE, Roy Stallings; and
ZBT, Ron Laupheimer.

No word has been received from

|coach Shillington yet on the exact

make up of the faculty squad. How-
ever, some greats of the past in-
cluding the likes of Dean John, Dean
Atwood, Dr. Emmons, Dr. Cook, and
Mr. Hannum are expected to mak
the liniment squad. It is hoped that
a few more will brave the student
catealls to do their best.

Impartially officiating the contest
will be two of the most popular and
able area officials, coach Norm Lord
and Buddy Deaver. They have prom-
ised to be fair toward both sides

Admission for the game will be on«
dollar. Proceeds will go to the P.E
department for use on some project
deemed to be worthwhile. Right now
it looks as if the money will be used
to help finance a new scoreboard for
the football field.

Last year between five and six
hundred dollars was raised by the
game. Proceeds from last year’s game
went to pay for an original member-
ship for Washington and Lee in the
basketball hall of fame. Last year's
game was the first in this current
series.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi
The Ring-tum Phi is published Tuesday and Friday during the college
year. It is printed by the Journalism Laboratory Press, Washington and
Lee University. The mailing address is Box 899, Lexington, Virginia.
Entered as second class matter September 20, 1946 at the Post Office,
Lexington, Virginia, under the act of March 3, 1878.

Editor-in-Chief Business Manager

 

Ring-tum Phi Play Review
(Continued from Page 1)

Duvall gives a sensitive performance of filial dedication in the violent
crisis of the final act, and Miss Prohaska is consistently poised and ef-
fective as the sincere, perceptive Petra.

The gentlemen of the press, vox populi, are quite well played by Jay
Hight, Lew Davis and Bob Hudson. Mr. Hight, as the moderate Mr.
Aslaksen, publisher of the town’s newspaper, is winningly self-righteous
and super-cautious, giving a properly restrained and credible performance
in his first major role.

Once again the Troubadour production staff has distinguished itself,
overcoming some obvious physical disadvantages in the theatre to put
together imaginative and functional settings. Our congratulations to
them, and to Dr. Jones, with gratitude for his exceptional energy and
creative ability.

 

Bergman’s ‘The Silence’ Tiring

(Continued from page 2)

She is convinced that she com-
municates with her audience leaving
with it an overpowering sen-
sual feeling. If a horselaugh is
the response growing out of a sen-
sual experience, then I guess she
does. Someone ought to find Ann-
Margaret an Italian lover and ship
her off to Syria to make movies for
the Shell Oil Company, or at least
give her to Walt Disney so that he
can make another nature movie.

Ingmar Bergman’s The Silence is
now playing at the Lyric and is not
at all worth what it costs to see it.
The Silence is the second movie in a
triology, following Through a Glass
Darkly and is not quite up to the
fine first movie. The Silence seems
to be Bergman playing at being

small, well-trained and highly paid
group of professionals. The service
academies are sufficient for provid-
ing the officers for such an army,
and there are enough people who
would choose the military for a ca-
reer to fill up the ranks.

If we consider the soldier as a
weapon, we see that he is a five
times more powerful weapon today
than he was in World War IL. The
soldier, however, while an effective
weapon in Korea or Vietnam or in
any future trouble spot, would not
be of major importance in a large
scale war. If we ever again come
to the point where we have 200,000
men opposing each other, as we did
at the Battle of the Bulge, it will be
no conventional war and nuclear
weapons will take the place of the
soldier in the field.

Inefficient Army

The large army which we maintain
today is outdated and _ inefficient.
Citing from his own personal exper-
ience, Dr. Colvin stated that when
he returned to Ft. Bragg in 1957 to
train guerilla troops, neither he nor
any of his fellow officers had the
vaguest idea how to use the equip-
ment they were given. After two
years in this position, he could only

understand that it amounts to cut-

part of which contains much imagery
essential to the symbolic patterns.
To say that this movie is bad is
unfair to Bergman but to say it is
tiring is fair to the prospective view-
er. Those who are interested in
Bergman flicks will want to see it
for it marks the progression of Ing-
mar Bergman who is one of the truly

So until more funds are provided to

work odd hours, I am afraid my only
suggestion is that students remember
the five areas that remain open when
the stacks are closed during the sup-
per interval and arrange to transfer
some materials when the warning
bell rings each afternoon. I could
ramble on with statistics about the
size of our staff and the unusually

fense. The fact that the draft is al-
ready being phased out is evidenced
by the recent cut in the reserves and
the elimination of ROTC programs
from several university campuses.
Dr. Colvin’s personal feeling is
that this gradual cut down will con-
tinue over the next five years un-
til eventually the Draft Act is re-
pealed. He was quick to add, how-
ever, that his opinion is only an
opinion and that no one should
blame him if the big arm of the draft
were to pick them up in the near
future.

Dave Geer, as well as the manager-
ial swansong of six-year veteran
John Heinzerling.

The General JV’s closed out their
season Wednesday as Lynchburg
beat them 49-45. A disqualification in
the final freestyle relay, one of three
in the meet for W&L, led to the up-
set loss and brought the season rec-
ord down to 4-1.

Taking firsts in the meet for the
Baby Generals were Joe Huston in
the 50 and 100 freestyles, John Thor-
sen in the 200 free, and the medley
relay team of John Baker, Pat Cos-
tello, Bill Clay, and John Ballatine.
Shortly before today’s Ring-tum
Phi went to press, it was learned
that the Georgetown team will not
be able to show up for tomorrow’s
meet due to an epidemic of influenza
in Washington. According to Coach
Eastman, the meet will be resched-

uled for sometime next week.

You see, I don’t attack fraternities
for their painfully unimaginative
dating habits. It takes two to ruin a
date, I guess. No self-respecting wo-
man would go into some of your
houses.

No, I question your pledging prac-
tices. Serious universities have re-
formed this most obvious point of
abuse. I am solemnly assured that
your question cannot change. Let it
die on its feet then, one last noble
posture.

Panel Discusses Fraternities

“the democratic form of a social
organization,” “the ancient free-
doms and particularly the liberty
of the mind with its attendant
right of inquiry,” “the dignity of
the individual,” and “the dignity
of man,” as well as the universi-
ty’s “Christian ideal.”

With this background, the panel
will go on to discuss what respon-
sibilities the fraternity has toward
helping the university live up to
those goals, and what in turn is the
faculty’s and administration’s re-
sponsibility to the fraternity. Special
attention will be paid to the frater-
nity’s own ideals and goals.
