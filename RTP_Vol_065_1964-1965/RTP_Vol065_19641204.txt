By BILLY CANNON
News Editor

The national leadership fraternity,
Omicron Delta Kappa, today tapped
thirteen students and five alumni at
its 50th Anniversary “tap day” as-
sembly.

The national honorary fraternity
which was founded at Washington
and Lee in 1914 selected 5 seniors,
3 juniors, and 5 law students at the
noon-hour assembly. Presiding at
the convocation was Steve Smith,
president of the W&L chapter of
ODK.

Membership in ODK is extended
only to those students who rank in
the upper 35 per cent of their class
and who have made significant con-
tributions in the fields of scholar-
ship, athletics, publications, social
and religious affairs, speech, music
and dramatic arts.

Dr. Samuel R. Spencer, Jr., pres-
ident of Mary Baldwin College, ad-
dressed the assembly (see related
story). President Spencer also
figured in another anniversary of
ODK event at Washington and Lee.
When the society observed its 25th
birthday, he was among those initi-
ated into membership in ceremonies

 

held in the university’s Lee Chapel.

Edition

Last April, the national Golden
Anniversary convention of ODK
made a special one-day pilgrimage
to Lexington for special ceremonies
commemorating the founding of the
society which now has chapters on
111 American campuses.

Professor Rupert N. Latture, pro-
fessor emeritus of political science,
is one of six surviving men who were
among the 15 who founded ODK
at W&L. He participated in the an-
niversary assembly. Another of the
original founders of the orgam.’.i-
tion, Dr. James E. Bear of Union
Theological Seminary, was also on
hand for the ceremony.

An unusually large number of
alumni were tapped. Smith ex-
plained that it was done in honor
of the 50th Anniversary of ODK.
The alumni included James Som-
erville, James C. Ambler, John
M. Stemmons, Major General
Archibald A. Sprowl and S. L.
Kopald, Jr.

Among the seniors tapped for the
honor were Stephen Todd Hibbard,
Loyle Shannon Jung, Forrest Lamar
Lamb, Larry Maurice Meeks, and
Jon Allen Supak. The junior honor-
ed included David Nicholas Mar-
chese, Frederick Myers Mindel, and

 

Charles Ganal Walker, III. The four
law students were Jimmy Delp
Bowie, Frank Eugene Brown, Rob-
ert Theodore Mitchell, Jr., and Rob-
bert Stephen Pless.

In one of the real surprises of
the ceremony, potential initiate La-
mar Lamb declined to the “tap”
saying, “Steve, I appreciate the hon-
or, but I cannot accept the tap.”
Lamb gave no reason for his refusal.

Somerville, Class of 1912, received
both an A.B. and a M.A. from
W&L. While a student here he was
editor of the Ring-tum Phi and was
elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Mr.
Somerville resides in Washington,
D.C.

Ambler, Class of 1918, is from
Montclair, New Jersey. He has serv-
ed as superintendent of schools in
Fauquier County and is now Chair-
man of the Board of Directors of
Ginn and Company, publishers of
educational books. Mr. Ambler has
been one of the University’s most
loyal and most generous supporters.

Stemmons, Class of 1931, is from
Dallas. He is president of the In-
dustrial Properties Corporation, and
is head of the important Dallas
Citizens Council. With his brother,

 

Storey, Mr. Stemmons is promoter

of the Trinity Industrial District, the
Trinity Navigation Project, Stemm-
mons Towers, and the Stemmons
Expressway.

Sprowl, Class of 1937, is from
Staunton, where he is vice president
of the W. J. Perry Corporation and
president of the Perry-Sprowl Cor-
poration, a mortgage investment
company. General Sprowl was dec-
orated for distinguished service as
a combat officer in World War II
and is now commander o fthe 29th
Infantry Division of the National
Guard.

Kopland, Class of 1943, is from
Memphis, Tennessee. He is a vice
president of Humko Company and
has the position of president of the
Rotary Club, Chairman of the Com-
munity Chest Campaign, vice pres-
ident of the Chamber of Commerce,
and a director of the Federal Re-
serve Bank.

Fitzroy MacleanCompares
Past and Modern Russia

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

Thursday night in Lee Chapel,
Brigadier Sir Fitzroy Maclean,
British Conservative Member of
Parliament, addressed a large audi-
ence on “Russia Yesterday and To-
day.” Sir Maclean, who is on a
speaking tour of the United States,
was invited here by Dr. Milton Col-
vin of the Political Science Depart-
ment.

In his hour-long speech and dis-
cussion, Brigadier Maclean compared
conditions in Stalinist Russia with

those of today and discused the
West's best approach to Soviet
Communism.

Sir Maclean was with the British
embassy in Moscow during the
purges of of 1937 which sent one-half
of the poliburo and general staff to
the wall. In 1937, Russia was under-
going “a reign of terror unequalled
in the whole bloodstained history of
Russia,” Maclean remarked. The
Russian people were terrified and
suspicious of everyone from for-
eigners to members of their fam-
ilies.

Fatal Date

Contact with foreigners especiai-
ly was “the kiss of death.” Illus-
traiting his point, Sir Maslean told

of his experience in once dating a_

Russian girl. That same night she
was dragged away from her home
by the secret police, never to be
seen again.

Sir Maclean then described his re-

Russia is still totalitarian, but less |
obviously so. Though it is still “hard- |
er to buy a toothbrush than a grand}
piano,” consumer goods are increas- |
ingly available. A permanent aristo-|
cratie ruling class has flourished, |
unlike in Sialin’s time when the|
governmental classes were first on|
the liquidation list. In general,|
standard of living and overall h yp-|
piness have immensely increased
since Stalin's death.

Increased Freedom from Fear

The Russian metamorphosis can
be explained, said Sir Maclean, by
a change in attitude of the govern-
ment. “Stalin learned only late in
his life that if you shoot all the
people all the time, they soon stop
really caring.” Khrushchev saw that!
maximum effort could not be achiev-
ed unless the people had some sem-
blanee of civil rights. He consequent- |

mented Sir Maclean.

Spencer Delivers Address;

Earlier this afternoon in

Doremus Gymnasium, Presi-

Implications

Of Referendum

By BROOKS BROWN
Chairman

With the referendum on traditional
dress scheduled for next Wednes-
day, Brooks Brown, Chairman of
the Assimilation Committee, revealed
that everything was set to hold the
referendum.

Looks Forward

Brown said this week that he and
and the members of the committee
looked forwatd to next Wednesday.
“We welcome the opportunity to

on dress and the committee,” said
Brown. “This is the first time that
sich a referendum has been held
so far as I know, and it represents
the best way for the committee to
find out exactly what students want
our standards to be.”

Study of Results

The results of the referendum will
be studied by the Assimilation Com-

tion rules reflect the opinion of the
student body as a whole. Brown said

realize that this was their chance
to speak for any changes they
wanted made. He further stated that
one of the main purposes of the
referendum was to prove to the
students that the Assimilation Com-
mittee wants to represent the cam-
pus as a whole and not just the
members of the commitice

Fears Lack of Thought

One of the major fears of the
committee apparently is that many
students will vote without thinking
Brown stressed the need for respon-
sible thought by each student before
his vote is cast

“Our that students will
vote against the committee or good
dress standards without really con-
sidering the implications involved.”
Chairman Brown said that he was
convinced that a vote for the aboli-
tion of the Assimilation Committee
was as good a vote to abolish tradi-
tional dress

*campus leader must, at the e-me time

he is a scholar and as a prerequisite
of being a politican, also be a campus
critic. .. . The ultimate object of so-
cial criticism is constructive change.
Before he can effect constructive
change, the campus leader must
first be able to analyze intelligent-
ly and discriminate between what
needs to be changed and what does
not.”

“The liberal studies which engage
us in our primary function as schol-
ars make critics of us all,” continued
Dr. Spencer. “It might even be
claimed that if liberal education is
doing its job, the degree of criticism
and unrest on a college campus is
a measure of the curriculum’s effec-
tiveness.”

“But the same liberal education
which informs its disciples with a
penchant and a capacity for criti-
cism must ... also give the critic an
awareness of the fact that he does
not act in vacuo, but rather in an
established framework of temporal,
spatial, and human relationships.”

Dr. Spencer went on to describe
the pitfalls open to a campus critic,
stating that “...the campus critic
must be, though it is often unexcit-
ing to do so, relatively temperate if
his criticism is to remain consistently
valid.”

President Spencer is an honors
graduate of Davidson College and
holds M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from
Harvard University. After serving
as professor of history and dean of
students at Davidson, he was inaug-
urated as president of Mary Bald-
win in 1957

Twenty-five years ago, Dr. Spen-
cer himself was initiated into ODK
in Lee Chapel. He is a member of
Phi Beta Kappa and the author of
several historial and biographical
volumes

“On the campus as well as in so-
ciety at large,” continued Dr Spen-
ser, “the exchange of old problems
for new, or at least of old problems
for the Same ones in new form, has
been the essence of social history
The real leaders are rarely mere
defenders of the status quo; they are

usually those who have been abl
to analyze intelligently the ills of
their own time and to exert som

influence toward constructive
+} ze. They have

cases, by being not just critics but

THE RING-TUM PHI

A Reasonable Proposal

In last week’s editorial entitled ‘Paternalistic Discipline,”
we revealed the need for abolition of Saturday classes. This
change would allow both students and faculty a chance for
uninterrupted research, in addition to other benefits mentioned.
To summarize these, the student’s could use the uninterrupted
day for the writing of term papers, doing Honors work, and
studying for comprehensives. For the faculty, the extra day
would mean chance to do research at perhaps the Library of
Congress, Duke or Johns Hopkins. At present though such ac-
tivities require cutting classes.

The major difficulty in making such a change is obviously
the re-scheduling of Saturday classes. However, when local
colleges such as Hollins or Randolph-Macon, are able to
schedule their curriculum to avoid Saturday classes, surely we
can do the same. We do not propose the establishment of two
“reading days” as exist at Macon, but we do wonder why
something along the lines of the Hollins system cannot be
worked out. Hollins students are required to sign up for fif-
teen hours a semester just as W&L students are, there are
five periods for morning classes just as there are here, but
classes meet only five days a week. Or consider a hypothetical
system. The lack of Saturday classes would result in the length-
ening class periods on Tuesday and Thursdays, so that there
would be only four morning classes and the fifth period classes
would meet Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. Why could not
such a system be effected at W&L, provided of course that
fifth period Tuesday and Thursday classes thus scheduled
be liberal arts courses which would not generally conflict with
science labs?

We do not have an infallible or concrete solution to pro-
pose. We do wish to show that effective systems, avoiding
Saturday classes, have been worked out at other institutions
of comparable reputation. Any change in the present system
would involve a great deal of study; perhaps such a change
is not feasible at W&L from the technical point of view.

We do feel, however, that the question of abolishing Satur-
day classes merits the consideration of both the students and
the faculty and administration. The revised freshman curricu-
lum which went into effect in September, 1963 was the result
of a faculty committee which had been studying the question
and preparing a solution to the problem for a two-year period.
Why could not, or should not, such a study be made for the
purpose of determining whether the abolition of Saturday
classes is a practical possibility? This study would not necessi-
tate the doing away of Saturday classes; it would merely
study the possibility and determine whether any solution would
be a practical one. Its proposals would hardly be mandates;
they would be merely a solution set up for the consideration
of the student body and the faculty.

Lamb, Frazier, Defend, Oppose Integration

By LAMAR LAMB
Guest Writer

“Twenty-six million Americans can’t be wrong.” There
are petitions decrying integration because it leads to miscegen-
ation. There are bitter and cynical references to a very slowly
progressing Board of Trustees for being too liberal. All of
these are evidences of an element which is irrational in defeat
as it has been in conception. The fact is, integration is a dead
issue. The fact is, this column should not have to be written.
But, unfortunately, there are those who would revive the issue.
There are those who would reject the whole march of history,

intellect, and humanity in order to preserve their perverse and
immoral petty prejudices.
Right of Association

The sole plea of these men is
that their right of association is at
stake. There has not been, and ap-
parently cannot be, a rational de-
fense of their real aim: to avoid the
Negro, to preserve the basis for
pitiful paranoia. Instead the defense

is an irrelevant one—“my right
not to associate.”
The defense is one which is

thought to be philosophical and
designed to cover the real motiva-
tion which is recognized to be
indefensible. The real reason for
the outcry causes guilty feelings
which only makes the outery more
desperate, more unreasonable, and
more dangerous.

“The right of association stands
as the reason for segregation” is the
proclamation which stands for a
multitude of sins. There is no de-
fense for racial prejudice in the
proclamation, no analysis of the
problems racism brings; there is
really nothing relevant in the whole
defense.

No Justification

The fact that there can be no jus-
fication for segregation is reason
enough for Washington and Lee to

 

 

 

 

By SAM FRAZIER
Guest Writer

There is an old saying that the only good cause is a lost
cause. If this is the case, segregationists call themselves “good
guys,” because the idea of absolute segregation is now no-
where triumphant. There is no state which does not have at
least one integrated school, no place of business which can
feel securely segregated with the placard, “We reserve the
right to refuse service to anyone,” and no employer who
can assure himself that no member of the NAACP will ever
work for his company.

Even back home in Alabama, those who once cried
“Never! Never!” have changed their
plea to “Later! Later!” With the an-
nouncement that Washington and
Lee university—the Shrine of the
South, the Tomb of Robert E. Lee—
had opened its doors to applicants
of all races, the last fortress fell.
The cause is now lost, and even
George Wallace cannot save it.
Truth in Saying

There is, however, a_ certain
amount of truth in the old saying
about lost causes. The main argu-
ment which can be advanced for
integration is that it offers a greater
amount of freedom to a vast num-
ber of Americans. However, it would
be as big a mistake to assume that
segregationists are not concerned
with freedom as to believe that all
of us regularly burn crosses and
bomb churches.

The most basic of all our free-
doms is the freedom to choose. Our
elections are nothing else but the
exercise of this right. Futhermore,
we are not required always to make
the “right” choice in order to re-
tain the privilege of choosing; we
may discriminate. All of us chose to
come to Washington and Lee. For
most of us the racial coloration of
the student body was not the basis

 

accept Negroes as students. There
are many reasons for us to aid in
the break down of a decrepit sys-
tem whic hhas left us with a pro-

As Others See Us

 

of our choice, but for some, per-
haps it was. As a result of the re-
cent change in admissions policy,
these students will no longer have

prerogative of attending a

fusion of problems. There has been Sweet Briar Agress With Hollins, Sle school and remaining o

no responsible study of the problem
which has not come to the same
conclusion: that racial segregation
is an anathema to everything West-
ern Civilization has sought or hoped
for.

Still, the cry is right of associa-
tion, Let me ask those who make
this ery one question: If I, for no
defensible reason, decide 1 didn’t
want to associate with blue-eyed
people, would I have the right to
demand that this school, or any
organization, keep blue-eyed peo-
ple from me? In fact, there are
people at Washington and Lee
with whom I am perfectly happy
to have absolutely no association
at all. Yet, I do not demand, I
could not demand, that Washing-
ton and Lee send those people

To the Editor:

We are delighted to be presented
with the opportunity to evaluate
Washington and Lee students and
since the Editor of the Hollins Col-
ums thoroughly expressed our senti-
ments, we may sound repetitious.
Sorry, boys, it must be catching.

The allegorical fantasy which
appeared in the November issue of
the Ring-tum Phi brought up
many sound points. We of Sweet
Briar agree that although the
Washington and Lee “gifts to wo-
men” think they have their
“honeys” from “Sweets,” if they
are not careful, they will have

 

 

away.
How can you make this childish

plea? I should think you would be)

embarrassed to speak so loudly
where you are so obviously wrong.
First let us see a rational defense
of your position, first let us see
honest examination of your motives,
first let us see one, just one, rea-
sonable argument for your point of

Political Horizons

 

Goldwater’s Southern Strategy Analyzed

By BRETT HAWKINS
Assistant Professor
of Political Science

The so-called Southern Strategy of
conservative Republicans was
grounded in the belief that virtually
all of the states of the Old Con-
federacy would support Senator
Goldwater. This belief was buttress-
ed by arguments that the South was
inately conservative and liked Sena-
tor Goldwater, that it preferred a
tougher foreign policy, and that it
would respond with ballets to Gold-
water's vote against the Civil Rights
Act of 1964

These arguments were not neces-
sarily unreasonable, But certain
other factors were also in need
of serious consideration, among
them the fact that Johnsen was a
Southerner (or at least spoke with
a Southern accent), that the grow-
ing Negro vote would be over-
whelmingly Democratic, that the
South was heavily Democratic in
registration, that many Seuthern
politicians would seek to use the
coattails of the President, and that
some of Senator Goldwater's dis-
abilities would affect even South-
erners.

extraordinary firmness of partisan
allegiance, the degree of support for
social security and TVA (Gold-
water's actual positions here are ir-
relevant; his vulnerability is what
counts), concern about farm price
supports, and the probable loyalty
of many popular Democrates raised
serious doubts about the Strategy.

And there was a much weight-
ier problem. What effect would an
appeal to the South, especially if
it could be labeled “racist,” have
on many traditional Republicans
whose conceptions of the Party in-
cluded vague notions about Abra-
ham Lincoln and even, in some
places, the Grand Army of the Re-
public? This problem, of course,
raised the spectre of gaining the
South while losing many “tradi-
tional” Republic states.

In all, however, it must be ac-
knowledged that the Southern Strat-
egy was not an impossibility. But
the belief that solidly Republican
South could be used as a founda-
tion to erect a Goldwater victory,
especially against Johnson, was not
very convincing

Even less convincing was the no-
tion that the Republicans unde
Goldwater could make decisive in-
reads into the normally Democratic
allegience of the “ethnic minorities.”
Relevant political

opinion leaders (particularly labor
leaders) and have little appreciation
of abstractions (such as the econom-
ic order) or what the two parties
stand for. Futhermore, Goldwater's
candidacy was certain to provoke
a massive effort by organized labor,
which regarded the Senator from
Arizona as a grave threat to its
interests

In order to succeed in its ethnic

Student Novel

By BRUCE RIDER
Friday Columnist

This week I thought I would dis-
cuss my latest book, Happiness Is a
Warm Date.

I really didn't want to write a
book, but somebody has to represent
the University in the great world of
the printed page.

At many colleges, universities, and
cigar stores the faculties are forced
to Publish or to Perish. Not so at
Washington and Lee. Handball or
Perish, maybe, but not Publish or
Perish.

Thus it is up to us, the dynamic
undergraduates, before we turn
inte overgraduates, to take up the
responsibility of breaking into
print,

Here, then, are some of the par-
ticulars of my particular book. It
will be published by the University
Press—that is, if I can find it, I
went looking for the Press the other

This was emphasized recently when

little for the friend who was avoid-

any lack on the part of the Univer-

in the individual who was “too

at a conference who pointed out
that a girl who expects to be

are beginning to realize that they
need not put up with little boy
bravado which is meant to im-
press fraternity brothers instead
of dates. We applaud loudly the
student who makes an effort to
provide transportation for his date

not condone the student who, wait-
ing for his date to arrive, quietly
or otherwise) crawls into his Bal-

freshmen, but it does not make
them overanxious for a return en-

The upperclassmen here who still
date undergraduates at Washington

but their statements are always
with “there are some

too drunk all weekend to know
that he has even had a date, are
the ones who give the student body
a bad name. They may be admired
by their fellow students as “the

are not admired by Sweet Briar

New Coach Brings New Look--
Fast Break, Pressing Defense

By GUY UNANGST

Step right this way into a Never-Never land where
guards are points, forwards are wings and centers are
backs, where what looks like a zone defense is really
an “area man-to-man,” where there are no losses, only
“non-wins.”

Here there’s a door crowned by a sign proclaiming,
“We won’t be out-hustled.” Inside there’s a brand-new
luxury with carpeted floor and lockers replacing
the hooks and nails of olden times. Before games
there’s hot tea with an inch of sugar and “old fogey”
music, Afterwards there’s rock and roll.

Upstairs the men who inhabit the room run and
run and run—they walk only in the shower where the
man in charge admits its dangerous to run. One of
them wears a golden jersey—he’s “defensive player
of the week.” Near the door there’s a big round board
with the home schedule and everybody’s picture.

During games they'll fast break and play their
“goulash” defense and guards will play point, for-
wards wing and center backs. There'll be a four-piece
Dixieland band.

They've got their own blazers with a special de-
signed emblem, a new set of short-sleeved, fingertip
length warm-up jackets and matching warm-up jersies,
and their own brochure. There’s a weekly news-letter
and a 50-page instruction manual.

Already there’s a confirmed schedule for next year—
a 25-game schedule with a Christmas foray into
Florida and trips to Tennessee and Kentucky, Satur-
day afternoon games and seven new opponents.

What it is is basketball—W&L style—Verne Can-
field style—and the players love it.

It’s an aggressive style, with a “nose-to-nose” de-
fense from half-court on, and players will get what
Canfield calls “hustle bumps” on their knees. The of-

Unable to take its league cham-
pionship, the Law School neverthe-
less placed four men on the 1964
All-Intramural football team.

Law, which finished second to
ZBT in its league, placed offensive
guards Bob Pless and Andy Ander-
son, defensive end Phil Lotz and de-
fensive back Wayne Barnes on the
16-man team named this week by
football officials.

ZBT went on from its win over
Law to become eventual school
champion, and it took down the big
prize—most valuable player, which
went to end Murray Jacobson. ZBT,
which defeated SPE, PiKA and KA
in the playoff, also placed Earl
Magdovitz at a linebacker post.

The rest of the team: Offense—
End: Ashley Allen, KA; Center:
Conway Shields, PiIKA; Back: Dutch

PHI KAP, which took just about,

everything in the way of athletic
trophies last year, now holds a
slim lead over SAE in the cumula-
tive standings. Phi Kap has 395
points through fall sports, SAE 393,
ZBT 386 for third place.

The rest of the top ten: 4. Beta
375, 5. SPE 367, 6. Sigma Chi 365,

“We've made a real good start. We haven't jelled

games. It’s going to take time—we’re not going to

Already he’s performed a minor miracle in trans-
forming a lackluster team that won four of 17 games
last year into an outfit that, on outward appearance,
seems ready to take on the world.

W&L opens an 18-game schedule tonight at Norfolk

opener is Tuesday against Bridgewater.

SAE Due For Fall

Kappa Sig, ZBT Are Favored

Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s domination of intramural basket-

SAE has taken three successive school championships and
won 22 games in a row. This year at least three teams are
better. Either Kappa Sig or ZBT will end the string, with
Beta a possibility.

team back, and adds Murray Jacob-
son, who quit the varsity. Beta re-
tains its I-M-leading defense and
continues to dominate the back-
boards.

games this week. Beta ran over

Associated Press Poll
Names Generals’ David

Bill David, Washington and Lee’s
senior halfback, was named this
week to the Associated Press’ Little
College All-America team.

David, given an honorable mention
on the team, was the only Vir-
ginia player named. The AP chose
both offensive and defensive pla-
toons for the first time since 1953.

David, as a flanker, caught 44
passes for a W&L record. As a run-
ning back, he carried 30 times for
108 yards. David also led General
scorers with 26 points, including
four touchdown catches, and was
No. 1 man on kickoff and punt re-
turns.

Neither the All-State nor All-
College Athletic Conference teams
have yet been announced.

David, the Generals’ co-captain, is
the first Little All-American since
Terry Fohs made the team as a
center in 1961.

inexcusible ommissions was Lamar
Lamb. Not only had Lamb been an
Executive Committeeman for two
years, leader of the Independent
Jnion, and a dormitory counselor,
he was a Dean’s List student and
active in several important campus
organizations. He, too, was blithely
overlooked in last December’s tap-
ping. Lamb's position as a critic and
would-be innovator was the likely
reason for his rejection by ODK.

Friendship Qualification

On the other hand, several peo-

e admitted to the leadership fra-
ternity had pitifully few qualifica-
tions, As individuals, though, they
had reputations for right-thinking
(agreement with the powers that
were). In some cases, they were
close personal friends of the big
men in ODK. Indeed, this seemed
to be the only qualification in the
case of one or two boys.

We are in a period of re-exami-
nation. We hear constant warnings
of weakening traditions, and are ad-
monished to preserve those things
which made Washington and Lee
distinctive.

I am in agreement. We should,
surely, preserve the best aspects of
our past in building the future.
One of the things we should be
most proud of is our position as
birthplace of Omicron Delta Kappa.
It would be tragic, I think, to see
the Alpha Chapter of this organiza-
tion lose respect and esteem in the

eyes of the W&L student body. ODK
is a tradition worth keeping.

Let us then hope that future
memberships will be chosen more
justly and in accordance with the
tenets of ODK. At the writing of this
article, today’s tappings are not
known, so we cannot be sure wheth-

crucial is the way integration is
applied at Wé&L. If only a few
Negroes are admitted and nothing
else is changed, we can accept or
reject association with them as we
choose. However, it is unlikely that
such a situation would continue for
long. W&L, after all, is unique in
its social domination by fraternities.
If the University is to make good
its promise that Negro students will
be on an absolute plane of equality,
the opportunity for fraternity mem-
bership must be made available.

At least one organization on this
campus has already suggested that
we follow the policy of other schools
which have integrated and are re-
quiring each of their fraternities to
admit at least two Negroes a year.
This could not only deny us free
choice of association and make fra-
ternity bids meaningless but it
would also cruelly place certain
students in social associations where
they are not wanted. However, if
we are to have true integration
and actual interracial contact, clearly
more is going to be required than
a mere change in admission policy.

Cause Not Lost

In the final analysis, integration
provides freedom to a person pri-
marily as a member of a group, not
as an individual. Segregation with
all its obvious defects does confer
a certain freedom on the individual.

Views On Integration Of W&L

The choice between the two has not
really been made at W&L. We ac-
cept the principle of integretion
while retaining the practice of seg-
regation, As a result, we are really
only kidding ourselves about our
convictions. The old “cause,” then,
is not wholly bad nor truly lost after
all.

view, then we can perhaps discuss
this matter.

Until you can do this, however,
it is foolish to cry out for irrele-
vant philosophical arguments, and
it is even more foolish to demand
that Washington and Lee keep
Negroes away so that no one will
have the right of inter-racial as-
sociation.

One final word: integration at
Washington and Lee doesn’t mean
that you will have to associate with
Negroes, it doesn’t mean you will
have to marry a Negro (it would be
difficult to imagine a Negro wanting
to marry you, or even your sister),
it merely means that Washington and
Lee is accepting its responsibility to
educate men, to provide a liberal
education, and help build that kind
of society about which Americans
have long dreamed and which has
never been so close.

ives of “coach” Lou Paterno. Kiah
Ford, third in I-M scoring last year,
returns to Phi Kap, but I-M manager
John Beagle says, “We won’t win a
game all year.” Perhaps he deserves
an award for frankness.

Delta Upsilon has Chuck Boggs,
last season’s No 2 scorer, returning
to League D action and, with its
experienced team, could be one to
watch. Phi Gam poses only a minor
threat to a ZBT championship ane
though Phi Psi plans to win the
league, it will have to settle for
nothing better than third place.

Barring a rash of ZBT broken

separations, the best: 1. Kappa Sig

sticky cover for the book. When the
reviewer says he can’t put it down
he’s gonna mean it, baby.

I have also given some consid-
eration to the actual contents of
the book, exciting though our little
technical discussion was. The first
chapter is shaping up as “Happi-
ness Is Not Being a Freshman.”
This will lump along until we get
to Chapter Two, “Happiness Is Not
Having Anything To Do for To-
morrow.”

Another chapter will deal with
local problems: “Happiness Is Cut-
ting P.E.” Here is a tiny excerpt
from this chapter: “We have learned
