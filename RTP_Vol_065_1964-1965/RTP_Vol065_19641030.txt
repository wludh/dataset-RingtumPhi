1120 Parents Attend Tenth Parents’ Weekend

 

Goldwater
In Student

By LARRY MEEKS
Managing Editor

The final results of Wednesday's
presidential straw vote gave Re-
publican nominee Barry Goldwater
58.0 per cent of the 760 votes cast
in the election. This is only a drop
of one per cent from the 50 per cent
showing he made in the Ring-tum
Phi straw poll earlier this month.

President Johnson received 404
per cent of Wednesday's poll in
which 760 students voted. This
number represents approximately
60 per cent of the student body
and an increase of 28 votes cast
over the poll conducted earlier this
month.

Goldwater made his strongest
showing in the Law School vote
which gave him 65 per cent of the
total votes cast from the Law School;
the final tally was 54 for Goldwater
and 29 for Johnson.

Goldwater's weakest showing
was in the junior class in which
he received 55.5 per cent of the
117 votes cast. He received 55.7
per cent of the sophomore class
votes and 60.8 per cent of the
senior class vote.

The biggest participation was on
the part of the freshmen with 283
of the freshmen voting. In the fresh-
man class Goldwater received 604
per cent of the votes cast.

In addition to the votes for Gold-
water and Johnson there were four
abstentions, one vote for Gov.
Scranton, one for Adlai Stevenson,
two votes for Gov. George Wallace
of Alabama, and one vote for both
Senator Harry F. Byrd and Walter
Judd

Hollins

In a mock election held yesterday

forces again came out victorious,
with a 56-to-44 percentage lead
over LBJ. Although the faculty
voteed 90 per cent for LBJ, the
senior class 52 per cent, and the
junior class 50 per cent, the fresh-
men and sophomore classes were
sufficiently solid behind Goldwater
to carry the election.

Of 249 students polled by the Tu-
lane Hullabaloo, 124 came out for
Johnson and 124 for Goldwater.

Atwood, Kulp,
Gilliam Speak
At ODK Forum

The ODK Leadership Forum,
which met last night in the Com-
mons, discussed the announcement
made by President Fred C. Cole
that Washington and Lee will lower
racial barriers in admissions policy.

Steve Smith, President of the lo-
cal ODK chapter, initiated the meet-
ing by stating that, through the dis-
cussion of the integration state-
ment with student leaders, it was
hoped that a clearer understanding
of what the statement meant would
be gained.

Jim Kulp, Student Body President,
made a brief address in which he
exhorted student leaders to accept
the responsibility and trust which
has been given them by their con-
temporaries.

Kulp stated that the students
present had been failing in two re-
spects: First, in the area of conven-
tional dress, he stated that student
leaders should exhibit a more lively
pride in maintaining the spirit of
this tradition. Second, he stated that
during Homecomings the student
body as a whole should be urged
to show the alumni that we do sup-
port the school and that we do pos-
sess a school spirit.

Kulp went on to say that a re-
quest be made to the faculty in an
attempt to get shortened Saturday
classes before the football game dur-
ing Homecomings weekend.

In reference to the integration
statement, he stated that the stu-
dents must aid in the implimenta-
tion of the integration policy, no
matter what the individual's per-

sonal feelings were

Dean Atwood acted as spokesman
for the administration, with the aid

Welcome Parents

It’s unfortunate, parents, that your being sandwiched be-
tween a combo weekend and the Southern Collegian won’t
allow you to get a complete look at Wé&L, but at least you'll
have a chance to see the other aspects of our daily life here.
We think that you'll like what you see. You'll see, for instance,
that your son’s wheat jeans are only worn for IM football
games; that, though he’s not writing, he has a good excuse
in that he has been working so hard; that all the boys from
the fraternity are true gentlemen; that your son is safe in the
hands of a competent medical staff; and that the speaking
traditions has done wonders for your son who was always so
shy and had trouble meeting people. We are proud that
you will have a chance to see all these things first hand, and
we know that it will be a comfort to you to learn that the
Ring-tum Phi staff is just a bunch of muck rakers. K. O. M.

How Important Is Your Vote?

This editorial is directed to those juniors, seniors, faculty
members, and parents who are presently asking themselves
the question, “How important is one vote?”

Tracing a string of events through history, Repre-
sentative Frank Thompson (Democrat—New Jersey)
says that one vote cast in 1843 has led to the nomina-
of the two major candidates for president this year.

As Thompson outlined it in a news release yester-
day, the vote cast in 1843 by Henry Shoemaker, a
farmhand in DeKalb County, Indiana, broke a tie and
elected one Madison Marsh to the Indiana State Leg-
islature.

In those days United States Senators were elected
by state legislatures and the Indiana Legislature had
deadlocked on five ballot before the newly elected
Marsh switched and broke the tie, sending Edward A.
Hannegan to the United States Senate.

Two years later, congress voted on the admittance

of Texas to the union. The Senate deadlocked 26 to 26.
Then Hannegan switched his vote, and Texas, the
home of Lyndon B. Johnson, entered the union.
In 1846 the Senate again deadlocked, this time on
President James K. Polk’s call for a declaration of war
against Mexico, and again it was Hannegan who broke
the tie. Out of the war thus declared the United States
acquired the territory that includes the present state
of Arizona, home of Senator Barry Goldwater.

Thompson used the example of Henry Shoe-
maker’s vote to underscore the importance of each
American’s voting on election day.

“The ballot he casts is his birthright,”’ says Thomp-
son. “He who does not exercise it does himself, his
community and his nation a disservice.”

(Associated Press)
x *

This election year witnesses the increase of five million
potential voters over 1960. This means that there should be
a record turnout at the polls, with, hopefully, at least five
million more votes cast in 1964 that the 68 million that were
cast in 1960.

Our fear is that those voters who lean to Johnson will rest
on the laurels of the Gallup and Harris polls and will stay
home on election day. Their complacence, if widespread, could
turn a rout into a victory for the Goldwater forces.

Lyndon B. Johnson has not yet been re-elected to the pres-
idency; he will not be re-elected if Johnson supporters main-
tain an apathetic attitude towards voting on November 3.

No matter who your personal preference is, how-
ever; the expression of political concern by voting is a
privilege that must be exercised. That it should be exer-
cised in 1964 is of particular import; the implications
and consequences of the election in 1964 are as signifi-
cant as those of any election since 1860.

Furthermore, it is the duty of every American citizen,
of whatever political conviction, responsible and caring enough
to classify himself as such to vote. Don’t let apathy or com-
plancence squelch your voice and vote in the election of 1964.

Dear Editor

You have asked for the election
of Johnson primarily on the basis
of his “talents” and his domestic
success in the past 10 months. How-
ever, Americans prefer men of prin-
ciple and character who do not
change their spots to suit the season.
Att a time when we need a strong
man to meet the threat of com-
munists, you want us to take a
Johnson who may be the first cross
between a chameleon and a snake.

Democratic propaganda accuses
Goldwarter of changing his position
on the issues, yet it appears that
Johnson is the one who has changed

 

on every subject EXCEPT BIG
GOVERNMENT. Read what Joseph
L. Rauh, Jr., a founder and leader
of the A.D.A. said about Johnson
just a year ago when Lyndon John-
son was the Vice President:

(1) He said that Johnson’s “first
loyalty was to the Southern racists.”

(2) He blamed a ruling by John-
son as Vice President while presid-
ing in the Senate in the spring of
1963 with halting an effort to make
it easier to stop filibusters which of-
ten were used to block votes on
civil rights legislation.

(3) He held Johnson “solely re-
sponsible for a governor in Texas

 

Pale Horse And

By JAMES JENNINGS

Parent's weekend is here and
very few people are thinking about

a full schedule of events which will
probably result in a slow weekend
at the State and the Lyric. For those
who might have nothing to do, how-
ever, let me point out that the
Beatles are in town in “A Hard Day’s
Night.” Since I reviewed this movie
in this column three weeks ago, I
add any further comments here ex-
cept to remind you that Time maga-
zine gave the Beatles a favorable re-
view. "Nuf said.
Spanish Intrigue

The movie that I would like to
talk about is “Behold a Pale Horse”
which is playing at the State. This
flick, which is composed of a lit-
tle imagery, a little action, and some
drama, is best described as interest-
ing. It is set in France and Spain
twenty years after the Spanish Rev-
olution. Gregory Peck as a Republi-
can at the age of fifty is in exile
in France but his mother is dying
in Spain. His best friend has been
killed by the Spanish Civil Guard
Captain, played by Anthony Quinn,
and a little boy, the dead man’s son,
has been sent to urge Peck to take
revenge on Quinn, Unfortunately,
twenty years does a lot to a man’s
physiology and attitude, and Peck
does not want to go. Just as he is
being convinced he must go, a priest
(Omar Shariff) brings complications
which point to the fact that he

should not go. The priest has his
own problem of should he, or should
he not, tell Peck not to go, and
Quinn is sitting in Spain wondering
if he will or will no go, and Peck

is certainly taking his time deciding
Yes, he goes. He and Quinn have a

flicks. The University has provided|

The whole flick hinges on a pres-

civil rights bill must be defeated.”

In my opinion the A.D.A. and
Walter Reuther forced the Demo-
crats and Lyndon Johnson to nomi-
nate Hubert Humphrey because they
do not ‘trust Johnson.

Can you see Johnson or Hum-
phrey ‘taking a TOUGH stand
against the grim communists from
Moscow or Peking? Think it over.
Our number one problem is com-
munism and all the domestic success
based on more spending and BIG
government in Washington aren’t
going to cause the communists to
dry up and go away.

C. G. GILMORE
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Dear Editor:

In the editorial column of the
October 20 Ring-tum Phi was ex-
pressed an alarming lack of under-
standing of Senator Goldwater’s po-
sition on foreign policy. It is alleged
that Goldwater is avoiding the for-
eign policy issue in this campaign.

I would like to refer your editor
to Goldwater’s major book, Why
Not Victory?. Adidtionally, in his
televised response ‘to Johnson’s
“emergency” speech, Goldwater out-
lined a three point program that he
would follow as President. I would
also like to refer your editor to most
of Goldwater’s campaign speeches,
for the imminent threat of commun-
ism and his ideas to combat it are
inherent elements of his appeal.

However, I would like to ask your
editor what Johnson’s concept of
foreign policy is. His stand on this

 

Johnson Stand Brings Goldwater Response

issue consists of glittering general-
ities which are inherently meaning-
less. The most revealing statement
of his is, “Let us continue.” Con-
tinue what? Continue killing our
men in a war which this adminis-
tration does not intend to win? Con-
tinue trading with the enemy and
strengthening him militarily (Tito
has the fifth largest air force in the
world and greatly comprised of U.S.
planes which are more modern than
‘those which our men are using in
South Viet Nam)? Continue allow-
ing our alliances to rot and weaken?
Continue to throw billions of dollars
around the world in the vain hope
of buying friends? Continue permit-
ting an offensive military base ninety
miles from our shores?

The point of this election is that
we cannot and must not “continue,”
for we have to reverse a trend which
will be fatal to the American con-
cept of freedom unless a new pro-
gressive, rather than defeatist, pro-
gram is proposed and implemented.

Goldwater has such a program: 1.
We must rebuild our grand alliances;
2. We must recognize communism
as our enemy; 3. We must confront
with a policy of strength and reso-
lution. Elaboration on ‘these points
is avaliable in the text of Goldwater’s
October 21 television speech.

Thus we must not “continue” un-
less we desire national suicide. We
must reverse a horrifying trend by
chosing a man who has a program
rather than one who has a catchy
phrase.

tion. Onee you have composed a
really good one you can make a
copy and tuck it away somewhere
and then pull it out again at Paper
Time

Here .then, is a good model for
an introduction: “In the beginning
prefacing the start of the introduc-
tion of this paper, I shall endeavor
to try to make an attempt to pro-
mulgete and set for the pros, and
last but not least. the cons of this
important informative subject.”

that you “couldn't put it down” and
think it should be “required

for everyone.”)

tion of our paper. The best procedure
here is to repite the title in as many
different ways as you can think of.
And should the professor want foot-
notes, simply find some book with
a vaguely relevant title and then
put in an “ibid” or two at the bot-
tom of each page.

By now you have spent enough
of your good time, and you are ready
to wrap the package up. A rambling
repetition of the introduction to-
gether with some phrases from the
title will do nicely. A few “there-
fore’s” and “thus we can see's” can
be added for emphasis.

The freshman was most grateful
for my advice and instruction and he
soon was off to what is quaintly
known as “Dorm I” to begin the

paper.

 

the same time be questioned for its
refusal to make immediate an-
nouncement of its decision,

As this writer understands it, the
board decided then that there would
be no public announcement of the
policy; indeed, that even the pres-
ent student body and alumni would
not have been notified.

Why?

Reasons

Several alternative reasons present
themselves as possibilities. Perhaps
the board wanted to avoid contro-
versary, which would surely result
if a newspaper announcement of in-
tegration appeared. Perhaps the
board wanted to side-step inevit-
able clashes with racially preju-
diced alumni. Or perhaps the board's
decision was only a_ half-hearted
one, token compliance with what it
finally saw as an imperative of the
respectable educational institution.

Whatever the reason or reasons for
the board's refusal to publicize its
decision, the fact of this refusal is
a real pity. The decision to inte-
grate was a good one, and it took
courage; but the cautious whisper
with which the board notified only
those people who had to know de-
tracts considerably from its image.

Not Too Harsh

How much better it would have
been had the board proudly released
its information to the news media!
How much more respect one could
feel for the board had they urged
the application of Negro students!

But we mustn't be too harsh with
the board. The very fact that they
opened the way for W&L to call
itself a 20th Century educational
institution is worth the highest
praise. And we must admit that,
when the reality of W&L’s extreme
conservatism is taken into consider-
ation, the board's decision—unan-

Booters After 7th Win;
Frosh Defeated At AMA

Varsity Might
Get NCAA Bid

By LOCK HANDLEY

When W&L’s unbeaten soccer
team goes against American Uni-
versity tomorrow, they will be risk-
ing not only their perfect 6-0 record,
but also a possible NCAA tourna-
ment berth.

According to Coach Joe Lyles, his
booters are currently considered the
favorites to represent the South at
the NCAA College Division cham-
pionships, to be held November 20
and 21 at Tufts University in Med-
ford, Mass. The Generals are rated
ahead of such traditional power-
houses as North Carolina, David-
son, and Duke.

A loss to American would ser-
iously damage the booters’ chances
for the nod, and the Eagles are
capable of an upset. They come into
tomorrow’s game with a 2-2 record,
having lost to powerful Baltimore
and Georgetown and beaten Gallau-
det and Loyola.

General fortunes tomorrow will
depend largely on the condition of
star forward Wes Horner, sidelined
by an injured hip for the game
against King College last Friday.
. If the booters get by American,

they will have to beat strong Roa-
noke College and defending state
champion Virginia to justify a tour-
nament bid. Should they receive the
selection committee’s nod, they will
be the first W&L team to go to
an NCAA tournament since one of
the Bob Spessard-led basketball
squads of the late thirties, according
to Athletic Director Cy Twombly.

Asked his opinion of how the Gen-
eral booters would fare in such a
meet, Coach Lyles said that he
thinks his team is capable of beat-
ing any team in the country on a
given day, “if we play our best game
and get our share of the breaks.”

Perez Gets 2
To Pace AMA

By LUKE CROSLAND

The Augusta Military Academy
soccer team, for the second time
this season, defeated the Washington
and Lee freshmen booters 3-1
Wednesday afternoon at Staunton.
This defeat brought the frosh rec-
ord to 1-3.

Although W&L came out on the
short end of the score, the game was
a close and hard-fought battle. Af-
ter a scoreless first quarter Manuel
Perez, one of the two highly rated
Mexicans on the Augusta squad,
broke through the usually staunch
defense and rifled a shot into the
nets.

W&L ‘then took to the attack, but
even though they consistently
threatened to score, the Augusta
goalie did a fine job of thwarting
their efforts. In the third quarter,
Perez scored again on the same
pattern that worked successfully
in the first half for the cadets and
Augusta held a 2-0 lead going into
the final stanza.

The fourth quarter saw the young
, booters finally break into the scoring
column. With time running out, Dave
Greenia put a heavy foot into the
ball. The long kick struck an Augus-
ta player and rebounded into the
Augusta goal, giving W&L their
first tally. However, the Augusta
squad drove down the field and
scored once more as the game ended.

The baby Generals played well,
but were unable to score as they
failed to capitalize on many oppor-
tunities. Charlie Harrold and Rich-
ards Burrough, playing center half-
back and left fullback respectively,
led the W&L defense. The frosh
will try to avenge their last three
losses in a home encounter with the
freshmen of Lynchburg College next
Friday.

 

 

Harriers In Triangular Meet

Washington and Lee’s cross-coun-
try team will play host to American
and Richmond Universities in a tri-
angular Parents’ Weekend meet at
2:15 tomorrow.

Coach Dick Miller anticipates that
the biggest challenge to General su-
premacy in the meet will some from
American, a team which W&L’s
harriers barely edged out last year.
Richmond should not be counted
out, however, for although the

Spiders have a poor won-lost,
record, most of their defeats have
| come at the hands of extreme-
ly tough opposition. And Richmond's
| Ronnie Jones is expected to be the
fastest man in ‘tomorrow's race, hav-
ing finished first in meets with
cross-country powers such as
Bridgewater and VMI.

Nevertheless, Coach Miller relies
on W&L’s depth to give the Gen-
erals a victory.

Confusion Reigns
In Golf Finals

By JOHN BEAGLE

Intramural golf should be long
over by now, but this is not the
case as confusion and weather have
delayed it considerably. Phi Delt
practically eliminated itself by vir-
tue of its forfeit to Sigma Chi. This
leaves Sigma Chi, ZBT and Sigma
Nu still in contention.

However, ZBT has beaten Sigma
Chi, and Sigma Nu has beaten ZBT;
while to make the confusion com-
plete, Sigma Chi claims Sigma Nu
forfeited to them. Confusing, isn’t
it? If that be the case, look for a
Sigma Chi victory.

In wrestling, last year’s fourth
place finisher Beta started off will
by beating the Phi Phi’s, 35-5, but
then lost to the Phi Psi’s. SAE, which
had earlier defeated defending
champ KA, lost to Phi Gam. Delt
won by forfeit over Kappa Sigma
after having lost to Sigma Chi by
forfeit.

SPE won both its matches last
week by beating Lambda Chi and
DU. Sigma Chi beat Kappa Sig, 35-
5, while ZBT won over PiKA, 30-5,
and Phi Kap beat Phi Delt, 25-8.
Ranking here: 1) Sigma Chi, 2) Phi
Gam, 3) Phi Psi, 4) SPE.

The intramural swimming meet
was held this week with the pre-
liminaries on Tuesday night and
the diving on Wednesday. Heading
into last night’s finals SAE led with
55% points followed by Sigma Chi
with 45, Beta 34, Delt 29, KA 20,
and Phi Kap 18.

Leading their teams into the finals
were Denman of SAE, Edwards of
Phi Gam, Huston of KA, and Clinard
of Beta...each qualifying first in
two events. Final results will appear
next week.

Bowling began this last Tuesday
and IM football continued during
the week.

W&L Gridders Face Bridgewater;
Generals Look For First Score
Since 21-0 Victory Over Oberlin

By JOHNNY GRAHAM
As one of the highlights of Parents’ Weekend festivities,
the Washington and Lee football team clashes with Bridge-|#
water College tomorrow at 2 p.m. on Wilson Field. :
Following a dry spell of three weeks the Generals will be| 7

trying to get on the winning trail for the first time since their |

®October 3 win over Oberlin. :
Bridgewater, out of keeping with]?
of the past,| :

Bridgewater teams

should provide stiff competition.

The Eagles have shown a stiff de-| 7
fense and all indications are that]
they will be mentally up for the]
game. With a 2-3 record as compared | !
to W&L’s 1-4 mark, Bridgewater is| :

fresh from a week’s layoff.

Against the only common op-
ponent, Hampden-Sydney, Bridge-
water lost 23-6 while the Generals
succumbed 21-0.

Injuries Hamper Generals
Two key injuries may hamper
the Generals’ attack, but McLaugh-
lin felt that neither were potential-
ly serious. End Curt Jennigan in-
jured his back in dummy scrimmage
Monday, and his condition is quest-
ionable. Center Chuck Long, in-
jured in last week’s loss to Hamp-
den-Sydney, has been hampered by
a bad knee all week.

On the bright side, running back
Harry Brookby, who has been out
for several weeks with a shoulder
injury, is fully recovered and ex-
pected to play.

Benson Doubtful

There is a chance that the Eagles
starting quarterback, Jim Benson,
who suffered a shoulder injury sev-
eral weeks ago, will not start. Ben-
son, a good passer is a serious threat
on the roll out and the pass-run
option.

McLaughlin expressed a hope that
the Generals’ running attack would
operate as well as it did in the
second half of the Hampden-Syd-
ney game when the Generals put
together several drives but were un-
able to score.

Players Praised

Several players received praise for
their play last week. Middle guard
Charlie Myers, who led the team in
tackles, and tackle Stark Sydnor
were cited for their defensive work.
Fullback John Anthony and guard
Jay Bowersox were outstanding on
offense.
