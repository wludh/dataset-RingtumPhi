One of the most known and pop-

Glenn Miller group was originally

|founded prior to World War II by

Miller and is now directed by his
close friend McKinley. The orchestra
was recently featured in its own

television show called “Glenn Mil-
ler Time.”

Two nationally famous vocal
groups, Joe and Eddie and the
Lettermen, have been secured for
the Fancy Dress Concert on Sat-
urday afternoon, January 30, in
Doremus Gymnasium,

The Lettermen have been very

|popular for the last several years,

especially in college entertaining.
Their albums, concerts, and night
club and television appearances have
always met with success. Some of
their records which have been at the
top of the hit charts are “Where or
When,” “Come Back Silly Girl,”
“The Way You Look Tonight,” and
“That's My Desire.”

Joe and Eddie, the other concert
attraction, sing in a style which they
describe as “folk-spiritual.” The two
have enjoyed a fast rise to fame
and give an enjoyable end enter-

‘taining performance. They special-

ize in a fast moving style of folk
singing, reminiscent of the great
spirituals. One of their most recent

But That Was Yesterday...

And it came to pass early in the morning of the last day of
the semester, there arose a multitude smiting their books and
wailing. And there was much weeping and gnashing of teeth,
for the day of judgment was at hand and they were sore afraid.

And at the last hour there came among them one known as
the instructor, he of the diabolical smile, and passed papers
among them and went upon his way.

And many and varied were the answers which were given,
for some of his teachings had fallen among fertile minds, others
had fallen among the fallows, while still others had fallen flat.
And some there were who wrote for one hour, others for two,
but some turned away sorrowful. And many of these offered
up a little “bull” in hopes of pacifying the instructor, . .. .

But that was yesterday.

Today is Friday, the beginning of Fancy Dress Weekend.
Today marks the 50th anniversary of the initiation of the
weekend which was begun by the university librarian, Miss
Annie Jo White in 1907. Although the weekend has a back-
ground and reputation surpassed by few college dance sets,
and although it requires great effort to match with reality the
reputation which the weekend has acquired, we feel safe in
saying here, at W&L, we have this weekend, Fancy Dress, a
collection of talent that is unsurpassed by any other college

dance set in the nation.

Consider the fantastic variety of music represented by the
various groups that are entertaining here this weekend: dance
music, Glenn Miller Orchestra;
and Eddie; popular, mood music, The Lettermen; ballads and
blues, Tom Pasle (performing during the concert intermis-
sion) ; rock and roll “juking’’ music, Ambassadors, Vibrations,
Thornton Sisters, Rufus Thomas, and Corvettes, etc.

Consider the careful planning that has been done by Dick
Kreitler and his vice-presidents in decorating, renting costumes,
publicizing the event, and co-ordinating activities in order to

bring this weekend about.

Small wonder that this weekend shows potential of being
the best ever. Exams have been breathing down our necks,

but that was yesterday.

indomitable determination to help the free men of the world|

save their heritage remains now and will always continue to be a

witness of faith and conviction against which lesser men can|

measure their efforts.

A Voice From the Past Tells Us How

 

Fancy Dress Can Be A Social Disaster

(Ed. Note—This column, written
two years ago by Sandy Fenn,
is being reproduced in this Fancy
Dress issue. If any reader identi-
fies with Fenn, to you our sin-
cerest condolences.)

For some it was the leading col-
legiate social event in the South, but
for me it was just another social dis-
aster. You see, I had this perfectly |
wild and gorgeous date coming in
from the North and all. I had given
her the big pitch one night when I
was slightly ripped, and had allowed
as how Fancy Dress was the greatest
small college weekend any girl
could ever hope to attend. Boy, that
brought her ears up just like a
blasted Doberman Pinscher, because
she was a bit of a social climber.
In fact, if you looked at it perfectly
objectively you'd have to admit she
could outelimb one of these skinny
little natives out in the Pacific who
scurry up palm trees to shake out)
coconuts and stuff like that.

 

Anyway, she was supposed to |

call me Friday afternoon and tell |

me how the devil she was get- |
ting from Washington to Lexington

so I could meet her. Well. I sat
there all afternoon waiting for
her to call or something, but
she didn't. All I could think of
was that I was missing the cock-
tail party with the Brothers Four
and drinking sours, By the time
she finally did call at six o'clock
I was sure missing the sours and
the Brothers Four a whole lot more

the history of his own life—and the life of his times that has
become forever inseparable from his achievements. It was a full,
rich and inspiring one over decades, but surely it reached its

tenth of May (1940) ...I acquired the chief power in the

I had the authority to give directions over the whole scene. I

while she was on that thing.

Anyway, I tried to play it cool
and didn’t bother to mention just
how much I hated her at that mo-
ment. Instead I told her “gosh,
wasn't it awful for her to ride the
bus,” and “wow, wasn't it wonder-
ful that she was finally here,”
which it wasn't. Then I went to get

she announced that her costume
was strangling her. Well, I couldn’t
try to argue that with her, be-
cause it was pretty obvious not
only that it was strangling her
but also where it was strangling
her. So we left, and went back to
try to berrow some clothes to go
to the combo party in.

That effort pretty successfully fin-
ished the weekend for both of us
because there wasn’t anyone around
quite her size. And after seeing her
in that Cleopatra outfit I could easily
understand how such a thing could
be possible. Anyway, she spent the
rest of that night, and most of the
next day, sulking around in her
room and calling me every two and
a half seconds to find out where her
bag was. Cripes, you’d have thought

I was hiding it from her or some-
thing.

Finally Saturday afternoon she
got real good and mad, walked
right down to the hound station in
her one fine dress, and took the
bus back to Washington. Some
weekend, man was it ever great.
Still, I couldn’t really blame her
for for not wanting to go around
all weekend in the same dress.
Therefore, just to show her I have
no hard feelings after all this time,
I've invited her down to Fancy
Dress again, And if the same thing
should happen again, at least I'll
be prepared. She doesn’t know it
yet, but I sent off and, in keeping
with this year’s theme, ordered
seven bunny outfits for her—each
about thirty sizes too small.

Generals ‘Defeat Wesleyan for First Win

Varsity Subs To Play As Team
Members, Schedule Not Yet Set

By LOCK HANDLEY

The 1964-1965 freshman basketball team, one of the most
consistently outclassed aggregations to represent W&L in any
sport in recent years, is no more.

Joe Lyles, their coach, said of them after they dropped
their sixth straight game to the Lynchburg JV’s on January

6th,

“They realize they’re not the best, but they also realize

that someone has to represent the*—

freshmen class.”

Since then, the freshmen have
picked up another loss (to Bridge-
water JV’s, by an 86-62 score), and
coach Lyles and varsity coach Verne
Canfield have thought it over and
decided that somebody else should
do the representing.

So when practice resumes after
Fancy Dress, the former freshmen
team will be replaced by a junior
varsity squad made up of the more
experienced members of the old
team and some of the varsity players
who have not been seeing action.

The main purpose of this move,
besides providing better representa-
tion for the school, is to give more
playing experience to the younger
members of the varsity squad. A
look at the statistics shows five
players who have been scoring few-
er than five points a game, some of
whom would obviously benefit from
getting to play more regularly.

According to coach Canfield, the
change has been in the works for
some time. If next year’s crop of
freshmen live up to the expectations
raised by his recent recruiting drive,
he said, the teams should return to
their normal status next season.

Schedule To Be Set

Details on the new team
to be worked out after Coach Lyles
return today from another recruit-
ing trip. These include the exact
composition of the new squad, the
arrangement of a practice

Yale Interested
In Coach Mac
As New Coach

Head coach Lee McLaughlin of
the General football team reported-
ly is one of three leading candidates
for the head coaching job at Yale,
according to a story carried Wednes-
day by the New York Times.

When reached for comment yes-
terday, Coach Mac said he hadn't
heard anything from Yale. He added,
“If that’s so they ought to tell me
about it.”

Yale has been looking for a new
coach since John Pont resigned the
job last week to take over as head
coach
Times, the other leading candidates
along with McLaughlin are Ben
Martin, head coach at the Air Force|
Academy, and Joe Paterno, an as-|
sistant coach at Penn State.

The Times also reported that Yale)
athletic director DeLaney Kiphuth|
has reactivated a committee of sev-
en which was first formed before)
Pont was selected two years ago.
Coach McLaughlin said that he
the committee
and Kiphuth two years ago befor«
they hired Pont. He added that “it
was a very pleasant trip.”

He didn’t close the door to
possibility that he might accept the
job at Yale if it were offered. He

did say, however, “I'm happy where
I am.”
Kiphuth told the Times that he

hoped he would be able te announce
a new head coach for Yale by the

end of the week.
McLaughlin first came to Wash-
| ington and Lee for the 1957 season,

when his team was 0-8. His best
teams have ben 1960, '61, and ‘62.
His overall record at W&L is 38-

2.
