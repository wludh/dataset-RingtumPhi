Nine Fraternities Sever Party Connection

By HOWARD EPSTEIN
Yellow Journalist

In an effort to destroy the clique
system employed in W&L politics,
nine fraternities have broken from
their former political parties, to form
independent units.

Specifically, these houses will stay
aloof from the upcoming freshmen
EC election and allow the freshmen
in their respective pledge classes to
vote according to each individual’s
personal choice. This system differs
greatly from the Party System
where each pledge class is told to
vote for the party’s candidate, for
the party’s benefit, and therefore for
the betterment of the fraternity’s
interest in the party.

After the now-defunct Progressive
Party’s clique meeting broke up
early Tuesday morning, the new
University Party (not to be confused
with last year’s University Party)
leaped into being and opened its
first clique meeting. Ironically, sev-
eral clique representatives who had
just returned from picking an EC
nominee for the Progressive Party,
were hustled into a new meeting of
a new party composed of a new
alignment of fraternities to choose a
new nominee for the EC post.

 

As a result of these recent altera-
tions of campus party structure, as
the Friday edition goes to press
(3:30 p.m.), the University Party is
composed of nine houses: SAE, Delt,
Phi Gam, PiKA, Phi Delt, SPE,
Kappa Sig, KA, and Beta.

The remaining nine fraternities,
Phi Kap, ZBT, Phi Psi, Phi Ep,
Lambda Chi, Sigma Chi, DU, Phi
Phi, Pi Phi, Sigma Nu, and the
Independent Union, met Tuesday
evening and agreed not to form an
opposing party. They did select a
committee to investigate the possi-
bility of introducing a more demo-
cratic nominating procedure to W&L.
This committee is headed by Lamar
Lamb, and is composed of Bill Can-
non, Warren Montgomery, Jean
Friedberg, Shannon Jung, Bob Lee,
and Earl Magdovitz.

There are ten unaffiliated political
bodies now on campus and each

one of them is free to put forth its| ’

own candidate. This condition may
force several ballots since the Uni-
versity Constitution stipulates that
the candidates for EC positions must
receive a majority of the votes of
the class. If on the first ballot no

 

single candidate gains a majority,

 

the voting will continue with the
lesser vote-getters omitted.

As of Friday morning, there are
five announced candidates. Richard
Nash, a Beta Pledge, is the Uni-
versity Party clique’s choice. The

other four candidates are running) |
independently of party affiliation. |

EC Selects —
Monday at 7

For Electica |

In Tuesday night's Executive Com-
mittee meeting places, and times
were selected for the upcoming
freshman and law freshman class
EC elections.

The freshman class election will
take place in the Commons Monday
night at 7:30, and the law freshman
class election will be in the South
Room of Tucker Hall, also at 7:30.

All freshmen to be nominated for
the EC post are asked to meet with
student body president Jim Kulp
in the Commons at 6:30 on Tuesday. |

A simple majority will be required
to win, and if no candidate receives
a majority, there will be a runoff
scheduled between the two eandi-
dates receiving the largest number
of votes.

Freshmen on authorized school
business will be allowed to vote by
absentee ballot. In order for the
absentee ballot to be counted, it
must state the nature of school
business that the freshman will be
away on and be signed by him and
witnessed by two other members
of the student body. Students vot-
ing by absentee ballots can send
them to the election by other
freshmen .

Ballots will be counted after the
elections and the results will be
announced and posted in the Student
Union.

The EC also decided to join with
seven area colleges in publishing
an intercollegiate calendar of events
of the various colleges.

Mike Nation, a sophomore, appear-
ed before the BC and asked their
consideration of a proposal to re-
vamp student elections. The change
would have to be made through 4
constitutional amendment which can
be proposed by the EC or by a pe-
tition of fifty students.

Nation’s proposal called for a sys-
tem of open primaries to select stu-
dent body and class officers. The
purpose of the proposal is to make
student elections more democratic.

 

Nation stressed that the plan could
be revised considerably but streased
that student body elections should
he more democratic. The EC ques-

, tioned him on his plan and then)

agreed to give the plan detailed con. |

ideration and study.

After last week’s busy agenda,
the IFC settled down Monday night.
It appears to this columnist that this
progressive IFC, rejunivated last
year by Art Broaddus and continu-

rent presidency of Steve Hibbard)
has decided upon another unique)
program,

Openings kicks off the first of four
major dance sets for the 1964-65
year.

The Dance Board has selected this
year’s entertainment on the _ basis
of a student poll conducted last
spring. The Shirelles, James Brown,

the Duo-Tones, and the Saints and
Sinners Band head the list of en-

tertainers for the weekend. Meshed
in between the musical array of

talent will be a football game that| ~

matches one of the most talented
small college teams in the nation—
Susquehanna—against W&L's Five
Star Generals.

The Weekend will officially get
underway Friday afternoon at 4:00
p.m. when Bill Jeffress, President
of Openings, is honored at a cock-
tail party featuring the Duo-Tones.
The party is at the Moose Lodge
and will last until 6:00 p.m.

The Duo-Tones will replace Dr.
Feelgood and the Interns who had
originally been scheduled to per-
form. The group has recently reach-
ed national prominence with its hit,
“Baby Shake a Tailfeather.”

The Shirelles will appear at the
Openings Dance Friday night at 9:00
pm. For the first time Washington
and Lee students will not be re-
quired to wear tuxedoes to the
dance; instead Dance Board Presi-
dent Steve Hibbard asks that all
students wear suits.

The Shirelles have recorded over a
dozen gold records, including “Mama

This Is A Free Election

Current political parties at W&L have had very short-
lived histories. The recent demise of yet another party, the
Liberty Party, is just another in a long line of witnesses to this
fact. At the time of its founding just last spring, a statement
was made by the newly founded party which stated that:

“We wish it understood that the members of this
party are bound solidly together in this effort, and that
appeasement will take no precedence in our decisions.”

However solidly they may once have been bound together,
the fact remains that the Liberty Party existed through no
election period. This is, however, only one example of the
instability that seems to plague political parties on this campus.

In nominating representatives for campus office, the parties
have in the past held nominating caucuses or “‘clique meetings.”
Two or three men from each house have gotten together
and have nominated their various fraternity brothers for the
office. After presenting his qualifications, a vote has been
taken by all members of the clique, and the candidates for
whom the majority of clique representatives vote has been
nominated. Once again this year the same political machinery
has been rolled out, a candidate nominated, a disgruntled
element has split with the rest of the party, and a new party
using the same antiquated machinery has been assembled.

It is, therefore, evident that the eighteen men (two clique
representatives from each house) who represented the new
University Party felt that Richard Nash was the freshman’s
choice and therefore nominated him. It may be that the fresh-
men enjoy having upperclassmen nominate one of the candi-
dates who seeks to represent them on the EC. It may be that
they appreciate having the responsibility (or privilege) of
selecting a man from among themeselves taken over by the
upperclassmen. Why it is not possible for college freshmen
to have enough discretion to select and nominate their own
candidate is beyond us. Surely it seems that freshmen, not
upperclassmen, should nominate and elect their own repre-
sentative.

Many of those freshmen who are pledges of houses in the
University Party will be told that it helps their house if they
vote for, and elect, the party’s candidate. Maybe . . . However,
those in the party today may not be in the same party tomor-
row. The instability of the present system could easily result
in yet another realignment within a few days or weeks, at any
rate, before the next election.

This political “sound and fury” may last a week,
but it will only last a week. The student government
must function throughout the year. It is, therefore, evi-
dent that the choice of the man, and not the mandate of
the party, is of more importance in the long run.

If you feel that you must appease the party, however, there
is an alternative open to you. You may listen to the instruc-
tion on why you should vote for your party’s candidate, and
you may seem to acquiesce, but the voting is by secret ballot.
No one need know that you voted for the man of your choice;
this is a free election.

This editorial is not directed against Richard Nash, or any
other man that has run for a party. Richard Nash is not, simply
because he is running for a party, marked as the upperclass-
man’s choice and not the freshman’s.

This editorial is designed to say only one thing to
freshmen: Don’t let the party, the fraternity, or the lack
of party usurp your inalienable right—the right to vote
for the man of your choice.

Openings, 1964 Style

Autumn is here, and so is Openings.

 

They come every year, and each leaves its mark upon the}

community. Autum leaves Lexington cold, and covered with
leaves. Openings leaves Lexington with numerous broken
windows, bottles, heads and hearts.

The number of fines, parking tickets, and arrests which |

the ever alert Lexington police force will issue this weekend
will stagger your imagination. The bank balance of the town
will rise tremendously due to this college windfall. It happens
every year.

However, Openings 1964, will be different in many re-
spects from those of the past. For the first time in years, Open-
ings Dance will not require tuxedos. This fact alone should as-
sure a good crowd at the dance, something that has not held
true in the past. Whoever is responsible for this change should
be congratulated.

Congratulations should also be extended to the Dance
Board, and its president, Steve Hibbard. Together they have
provided Washington and Lee with a line-up of truly great
performers. The Shirelles and James Brown are guaranteed
to put on a good show. A show that will be remembered for
a number of years. Add in the cocktail party, and the fraternity
parties, and you will have a weekend that should top that of
any other college or university.

Saturday's football game with Susquehanna should also
be interesting. Not only will W&L’s record of home victories
be at stake, but also the safety of the team. Susquehanna is
big, and has averaged 400 yerds per game. Statistics are not
all, however. Win or lose, it will be a game to remember.

Date or no date, drunk or sober this should be one hell of

a weekend. —L. N. M.

 

Free Choice Trampled By Big Clique

By MALCOLM MORRIS

Last Tuesday’s pre-dawn party
realignment is perhaps the most
blatant effort yet by a group of
fraternities to exercise political dom-
ination at the expense of responsibil-
ity and free choice at W&L. This
group of houses, or rather political
bosses, is unequaled in the obvious-
ness with which they have rejected
any concept of a student’s voice in
his government or any idea that a
candidate be respected or highly
qualified. In no previous party
switch have the supposedly reassur-
ing promises of the new clique
sounded quite so hollow or seemed
so absolutely and unbeliveably ludi-
crous.

The new University Party, alias
the “big clique,’ has seemed to
base their move on one of two
assumptions. They figure the Stu-
dent Body as big enough suckers
to follow along without protest, or
they feel they are strong enough
to tell the rest of the Student Body
to take a long walk and just leave
the details of the student elections
up to the wise and all-powerful
political bosses. This whole political
change would be a complete joke
worthy of a carnival if it did not
in fact endanger our most valuable
tradition, the honor system,

Cliques

Political cliques can pass around
the class officers without any con-
cern for qualification, and it doesn’t
hurt anyone simply because those
officers don’t mean anything. How-
ever, when party cliques disregard
qualifications, responsibility, and re-
spect in their nomination of Execu-
tive Committee members, they pose a
real threat to the preservation of
our honor system.

The honor system rests squarely
upon the faith which each student
must have in the responsibility and
judgment of his elected representa-
tives on the Executive Committee.
These positions carry not just pres-
tige but an awesome responsibility.
An EC position is not to be held by
the pledge just because his fraternity
clique man wheels and deals the
best.

This position is not to be held by
a pledge just because his party clique
man has gathered together a party
built on the hunger to dominate and
not to nominate. This position is not
to be held by a pledge just because
his fraternity has no BC member and
its campus prestige demands one,
ie, a man from one of the “stud”
houses, sent to rule over the cam-
pus lizards.

Overwhelming Choice
Certainly the University Party was
formed only to grab complete con-
trol of the student government
without any regard to the respon-

sibility which should accompany
power. What other reasons can any
of the party clique chairmen give
for their realignment. These politi-
cians can’t say they left the Liber-
ty Party because it was not operat-
ing fairly or didn’t nominate a
highly qualified man. The Liberty
Party chose a man who was the
overwhelming choice of his class-
mates in a preferential poll. This
man was highly qualified by a fine
school record.

In fact, he was the choice of most
of the clique men at a Sunday night
meeting, even of several of the
houses now in the University Party
supporting Nash.

 

It seems hard to explain how at

least two houses suddenly changed
their minds on the best qualified
man,

The new party can’t be said to be a
result of doublecrosses or the break-
ing of party lines. There was no
election in which this could have
happened. The Liberty Party was
certainly as harmonious as any ten
clique men could have made it.

There seems to be but one con-
clusion left for the formation of the
University Party. This party seems
to have been formed solely and
blatantly for the purpose of depriv-
ing W&L of a student government
with the best representatives and
with a base broader than nine
fraternity clique men.

 

Already six out of eight fraterni-
ty members of the EC represent
houses in the University Party. The
election of Richard Nash would
make it seven out of nine. If the
freshmen who are pledged to the
big clique houses allow their clique
men to vote for them, they may end
up with more power and another
victory for their party. However,
they may also end up with a week-
ened student government and a
dead honor system.

Is it really possible that here at
W&L, 1200 men are to be controlled
by nine clique men of such obvious
irresponsibility and disregard for
any such foolish ideas as qualifica-
tion, respect, or free choice?

Well, as of earlier this week, we

were except for a couple of excep-
tions.

The Liberty Party, formed with

never made it through an election.
Now there are loud cries from the

have been attacked with more or
less enthusiasm since my freshman
year depending upon the circum-
stances... but political parties are
still with us and despite the ‘sound
and fury’ of current reformists will
probably stay with us.

I would not be one to defend the
party switches, alignments, re-align-
ments, and new parties that have
occurred since my freshman year—
with few exceptions—but I see no
good in the attacks being made
(many of them unjust) that can only
result in ill-feeling among houses
and among members of houses.

W&L politics has always been a
game played by the clique repre-
sentatives and will probably always
be such a game. Every house wants
political offices to use as rushing
‘capital’ and I dare say that not
one of the houses that are now
‘independent’ would have turned
down an invitation to join the new
University Party. Perhaps, there is
one—the Sigma Chi’s—who decided

 

Big Clique Domination Refuted

last spring to become and remain
independent.

Perhaps, I am being non-idealist,
but I fail to see where party poli-
tics has hurt the campus. Sure the
parties pass out offices, especially
the smaller class offices, but I per-
sonally think that this is good in
that it gives a wide cross-section
of fraternity representation among
the offices. And, when it comes to
the executive committee members
the parties must nominate qualified
men because party ties and straight
party voting simply doesn’t hold at
this level.

In fact, an examination of last
spring's elections would seem to in-
dicate that a majority party can't
even hold its members at the level
of class elections if they don’t put
up the best qualified candidates.
Prior to last spring's student body
elections, the Delis and SPE’s
switched to the University Party
making an eleven-seven split with
the University Party in the majority.

Indecision And hao Of Face
Attend Speaking Tradition

By BRUCE W. RIDER

As all mothers of Washington and
Lee students know, there is some-|
thing on our fair campus known as
the Speaking Tradition.

At least once each year some hot-|
head scribbles a letter to the editor)
of the Ring-tum Phi stating that all
our traditions are not traditions at
all and who needs them anyway. |

And immediately a group of nine-|
teen-year-old reactionaries rises up)
to defend the hallowed practices of|
the University.

Unfortunately, all of these people
miss the point.

The problem isn't what should we
do with the Speaking Tradition but
rather what the devil do you say and |
do when being Speakingly Tradi-
tional’

The scene: you are coming up the
walk te the campus. In the misty
distance another student approaches.
Will he speak? Who should speak
first? How close should get before
speaking? It's like a gun duel at high
noon in Dodge City and someone

forgot to tell you which man is
Marshal! Dillon

There is also a loss of face in-
volved if one is not careful. Some
few students, miniscule minority

though they may be (and contrary |
to the spirit of the Alumni Maga-|
zine) do not speak at all. Thus you
must be able to judge whether or

nored. If this happens too frequently
you begin to wonder if you are in-
visible.

But let's get to the central question

| concerning the Speaking Tradition:

what to say.

Should your greeting be a big
friendly “good afternoon, fellow stu-
dent, it is indeed nice to see you

| on this lovely day,” or a briefer “hi,

Bub"? And what do you say to a
whole group of students walking to-
gether? It takes considerable skill
to say the proper thing to the prop-
er persons at the proper time.

And lurking behind all of this is
the awesome and majestic Assimila-
tion Committee. Suppose you neglect
to speak, or to provide a hearty
enough hello? A little white card
with your name on it will be placed
in a little brown box in the big Com-
mons. And who among us has ever
emerged unseathed from the ordeals
of a Student Commitiee?

We must remember that a sense
of duty is involved with Speaking
Traditionaliy. Who is so cruel as to
not speak to a bright-evyed fresh-
man (a member of the best quali-
fled. highest College Boarded class
ever to enter W&L) or to a kindly
professor or to an open-shirted tour-
bat?

Perhaps the solution to all of our
Speaking problems lies in having all
students wea:

 

signs similar to the
not a man will return your greeting| {freshman name tags which would
before you hazard a hello. It's most! bear a personal greeting to one and

embarrassing to speak and to be ig-| all.

Crusaders Favor

W&L At Home Against epee

Generals Depend on Passing Game ;

{
¥

BY GUY UNANGST

Washington and Lee Univ

game on its home Wilson field since early November of 1959.
Tomorrow the Generals play Susquehanna University, ranked
seventh nationally by the Associated Press small college poll,
and their streak will probably end abruptly.

Susquehanna’s Crusaders, o
ly riding a 12-game win string, and*
have lost only one of their last 35
games. Four of the victories have
come this year, including a 42-0 ver-
dict against Randolph-Macon, which
defeated W&L, 8-0.

The last time the Generals lost
here was when another bunch of
Pennsylvanians, from Carnegie Tech,
beat them, 20-16. There was a tie
with Johns Hopkins in 1960, but
W&L has won all 15 since.

Susquehanna brings a team aver-
aging 403.3 yards total offense and
34 points a game, and W&L coach
Lee McLaughlin rates them the best
to play here since Wittenberg, cur-
rently No. 1 among small colleges
mauled the Generals, 61-26 in 1957.

Although the Crusaders have
given up only 30 rushing yards a
game, their passing defense has
sometimes been lax, and this is
where McLaughlin hopes to strike.
Juniata, in losing, 36-17, last Sat-
urday, completed 19 of 33 passes
against Susquehanna.

“Our pass defense was very bad,
even though we spent a lot of time
on it during the previous week,”
Crusaders coach Jim Garrett said.
“We have a veteran team with eight
seniors in the starting lineup and
we shouldn't be making so many
fundamental mistakes.”

Said opposing coach McLaughlin,
“We threw 27 passes last week
against Centre and we'll throw as
many as we did then—more prob-
ably.”

W&L's main problems will be
getting the ball. Against Juniata,
Susquehanna halfbacks Larry Erd-
man and John Vignone and full-
back Bill Galbraith combined for
361 yards on the ground. In all,
Susquehanna gained 425 yards, all!
rushing.

The Crusaders’ offense is typified
by a drive two weekends ago against
Marietta. Using 19 consecutive rush-
ing plays, they marched 70 yards in
10 and one-half minutes to score
their final touchdown of a 36-19 win
with three seconds left.

Erdman, Vignone and Galbraith
share the load with Gilbraith car-
rying when Susquehanna nears a
touchdown. The short (5’ 8”), 195-
pound senior has already scored
ten touchdowns.

The Crusaders are big, with ten
linemen weighing more than 200
pounds. Bill Muir, a 230-pounder,
is the largest, and heads a strong
contingent at his position.

Susquehanna won last year’s game,
the first in the series, 31-0.

Saturday either W&L’s string of

Wilson Field wins or Susquehanna’s| —_

unbeaten streak will be broken.
Chances are W&L will end up on
the short end in the first of four
consecutive home games .

“I plan to make basketball a recog-

great changes overnight.” He added,
“I think you will see a marked dif-
ference in the attitude of the play-|
ers this year.”

While noting that official basket-
ball practice won't start until Mon-
day, Canfield pointed out that “many
players have already been work-
ing out on their own for a week
now.” He pointed to this as evidence
of increased interest this year.

Canfield said this year’s schedule
calls for a 16 game slate with next
year’s schedule being longer. That
schedule calls for a 26 game season
and features trips to Florida and
Kentucky.

LM Finals Start
= Football, Wrestling Seasons Next

By JOHN BEAGLE

Golf ended Tuesday afternoon
with three league champs decided
and with the fourth league ending
in a three-way tie for the top spot.

Phi Delt won League A and is
favored to capture the champion-
ship. Sigma Chi looms as the top
threat for Phi Delt as they took
the top spot in League B.

Winner in League C was ZBT
while League D had a _ two-way
tie between Sigma Nu and Delt
which will be played off before the
finals start.

Tennis ended last Friday as Beta!
successfully defended its league title)
in League A. SAE upset Phi Kap|
in a close 3-2 match to take the
honors in League B.

In League C, another three-awy
tie occurred between Phi Delt, ZBT,
and PEP. However, PEP gained the
finals by defeating ZBT after the
Zebes had first upended Phi Delt.
KA, as predicted, won the title in
League D. In the finals PEP has the
edge, but KA looks like the main
threat with SAE rating as the dark-
horse. Beta should finish fourth.

Football started Wednesday and
last year’s league champs in B and
C got off to fast starts.

Last year’s second place finishers,
the Law School trounced Phi Delt,
24-0. The Law School looked good
on both defense and offense. SPE,
which finished third last year, de-
feated Kappa Sig, 30-14, in a wide-
open offensive game. Beta and Sig-
ma Nu had their game postponed be-
cause of the World Series.

This year in I1-M football, an All-
Star team will be chosen at the end
of the season. The officials of the
games will be the main judges in
choosing the team. Leyburn Mos-
by is the head official for football
and will be in charge of choosing
the team.

U.Va. Frosh Defeat
Baby Booters, 5-2

Washington and Lee’s freshman
soccer team dropped its second game
in three starts Wednesday, losing to
the University of Virginia frosh by
a 5-2 margin on the Cavaliers’ home
field.

The Baby General booters got off
to a good start as Ralph Schenkel
connected early in the opening per-
iod for the first score of the game.

men proceeded to rack up all five|
of their goals before W&L got back
in the scoring column on Al Craig’s
fourth quarter kick.

Freshman coach Bob Lathrop con-
fessed after the game that he was
“disappointed” by his squad’s per-
formance. “I don’t think we played
jour best game at all,” he said. “I
think we have the material to look

much better than we did. In fact,
we proved that against Randolph-

 

~1|} Macon.”

 

The team’s next outing is set for
October 28 on the W&L field against
Augusta Military Academy. The Ca-
dets beat the Baby Generals 4-2
| in an earlier meeting, but the fresh-
|}men have gained a great deal of

experience since that contest and
| should do much better this time out,
according to Coach Lathrop.

, Injuries Dampen
& Generals’ Hopes

Injuries are the number one prob-

lem for Coach Lee McLaughlin and

the Washington and Lee Generals as
they prepare for tomorrow’s home
opener against Susquehanna at Wil-
son Field. Game time is set for two
o'clock.

One person is definitely lost for
tomorrow’s game while the playing
status of five more Generals is
doubtful.

Lost for tomorrow’s game and the
rest of the season is senior guard
Bo Earnest. Doubtful starters for
tomorrow’s game include the team’s
top ground gainer, junior fullback
John Anthony, and the team’s other
senior guard, Curt Jernigan.

Coach McLaughlin also reports
that the playing status of halfbacks
Tom Crenshaw, Skip Chase and
Harry Brookby is questionable.

In last year’s game between the
two Squads, Susquehanna snapped
the Generals nine game winning
streak with a 31-0 thrashing of

*W&L. The only team to have faced

both squads this season is Randolph-
Macon, and they beat W&L, 8-0,
while losing to the Crusaders, 42-0.

So far this season, the Generals
have been their own worst enemy.
Upset by Randolph-Macon in their
opener when they couldn’t captalize
on scoring opportunities, the Gen-
erals dropped their game last week-
end when Centre blocked a W&L
quick-kick near the General goal
line. That set up the Colonels for
the game’s only score.

The Generals offense this season

But U.Va.’s ability to control the | i. reminiscent o fthe 1957-50 era
ball soon told as the Wahoo fresh-| when the team took to the air in an

effort to develop its scoring punch.

Quarterback Larry Craig has al-
ready thrown more passes in three
games this season than any W&L
quarterback threw all last season.
With 29 completions, Craig needs
just four more to equal the Wash-
ington and Lee total for last season.

End Bill David, who was last sea-
son’s top pass receiver, has already
caught more passes than he did all
last season and has gained almost
as much yardage. During the entire
season last year, David caught but
20 passes for 222 yards. This year
he has already pulled in 21 passes
for 213 yards.

While conceding that the Craig-
to-David combination makes for ex-
citing action, Coach McLaughlin
points out that so far this season it
has added up to just one touchdown.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Saunders Supported By IU

Tuesday night the W&L Student
Body witnessed the collapse of the|
infant Liberty Party.

By this time it should be clear
to each freshman that this move was
NOT made in the interests of elect-
ing the most qualified candidate for
Executive Committee. This grand
coup d’etat was conceived and exe-
cuted under the banner of the “pat-
ronage rotation” system, the roots of
whie hare greed, the results of which
are bad. Indeed it is a fact that this
blatant disregard for the student
weal does not find its origin in the
formation of the University Party,
but rather has been a prominent
characteristic of campus parties in
recent years.

Recognizing this disregard of
Freshman interests, the Independent
Union on Thursday night adopted
a resolution: The political system,
as it now stands is not in the interest
of the student body and must be
drastically changed. Because the IU.
acknowledges that the victory of the
University Party in this election
would only further entrench this
party cynicism, the I U. believes
that the University Party must be
defeated.

After carefully considering the
qualifications of each of the four ma-
jor candidates, and after listening
to statements by each, the Indepen-
dent Union officially endorses Steve
Saunders its candidate in the
belief that he will actively work for

as

 

the restablishment of the parties
along lines of individual member-|
ship. The qualifications of Steve |
Saunders are far too numerous to|
mention here. Suffice to say that a

In order to obtain the maximum
welfare from these proposals (and
from the government), they should
be effected by next semester. Of
course, there are always those who
perniciously insist on adhering to
tried and proven ways; however,
no progressive person can deny that
all old ideas are outmoded and
malignant and must be replaced with
new ones immediately. These new
courses will do much for W&L in
the way of agrarian reform, but

 

they must be enacted by the faculty
NOW, before they become old
