EC

Smith Defends
Campus Political
Reorganization

By MIKE HASH
Managing Editor

 

Campus political parties and the |

clique system in particular were dis-
cussed last evening by the EC in
consultation with Steve Smith, the
author of revitalized political sys-

tem. Smith who presented his plan in |
a recent editorial answered questions |

and defended his proposal.

The general consensus of the EC
was favorable to the new plan. There
was some question of whether the
operation of open primaries within
each party would, in reality, be free
from clique domination. Although
several members of the EC felt that
clique control was inevitable, the
majority of the committee believed
that the new system would “once
remove the clique from campus elec-
tions.”

End of Clique Rule

In response to inquiries concern-
ing the feasibility of implementing
this proposal, Rick Carrell suggested
that open primaries be instituted in
the existing University Party. Carrell
felt that this would encourage the
nine houses not associated with any

pose of a primary. The open primary
would be required of all parties in
an effort to eliminate “rule by the
clique.”

Carrell further stated that if the
open primary system were adopted
the major opposition to party polities
would be removed. The so-called
independent houses have been, in
effect, protesting by non-participa-
tion in campus parties primarily be-
cause of the “machinations” of the
cliques

Sub-Committee Appointed

Final action on the proposal will
await the report of a sub-committee
headed by Rick Carrell and mem-
bers Fred Mindel, Bryant Kendrick,
and Dave Geer. This sub-committee
will present a specific proposal te
the EC at an early date. If passed
the proposals will necessarily require
a constitutional amendment and rat-
ification by the student body.

Springs Concert

For Saturday Eve
To Be Outdoors

By JIM CROTHERS

President of Springs Dances, Dave
Marchese, announced today that in
order to provide some variations to
weekend's format, Saturday
night’s concert in this dance set will
be held outdoors.

Arrangements are being made to
use the practice football field located
adjacent to Wilson Field. The vice-
president in charge of the concert,
Chuck Griffin, plans to provide
chairs for the faculty and explained
that students are urged to bring
blankets to sit on since seating fa-
cilities will not be provided.

There will be plenty of seating
space, but students are urged to be
on time to the 8 p.m. concert since
the space will be allotted on the first-
come basis.

Tickets and admissions for the
concert will be handled in the same
manner as they would for a regular
inside performance. The only en-
trance to the show will be at the

Although the entertainment for
Springs has not yet been announced,
Marchese noted that he was sure
everyone would enjoy the new ar-
rangement, and that every effort was
being made to insure good sound
reproduction.

In case of rain or wet grounds, the
Saturday concert will revert back
inside to Doremus Gymnasium, and
will be held at the customary 8 p.m,

NOTICE

There will be a Conservative
Society meeting on Wednesday
evening at 7:30 p.m, in the East
Room of the Law School. All
members are urged to attend this
business meeting since a new So-
ciety chairman will be selected at

Friday night, February 26, a sym-
posium in the form of a panel dis-
cussion by four distinguished guest
speakers was held at VMI in which
the merits and failings of the pro-
posed Medicare bill were discussed.
The four panelists who were selected
individually, having no foreknowl-

edge of what one another had to
say, were introduced by the moder-
ator, Dr. Crawford, a practitioner in

nearby Woodstock.

The topics of the discussion ranged
from “Eldercare” to socialized medi-
cine and dealt with numerous as-
pects of the Medicare question from
several viewpoints. The first speaker,
Dr. Guy Hollifield, is an Assistant
Professor of Internal Medicine at the
University of Virginia, who was
concerned, “not with the philosophy
behind the proposed program of
Medical Ouare but application
among the people.”

Student Health
Group Submits
Report To Cole

By FRANK L. FAIRCHILD, JR.

The new Student Health Commit-
tee, appointed by President Cole last
fall to make a comprehensive sur-
vey of the present health services
and to submit recommendations for
changes and improvements, has re-
cently concluded its study. A num-
ber of the committee’s suggestions
have already been accepted and act-
ed upon.

Psychiatrist Joins Staff

Dr. Wingfield, a Lynchburg psy-
chiatrist, is now visiting the campus
each Monday afternoon as a result
of a committee recommendation.
Other suggested changes will be
acted upon in the future and the
Committee’s study will form the
basis of the Self-Study Committee's
consideration of the student health
area.

Initiation in April

The newly elected members will
be initiated in early April follow-
ing the University’s annual Phi
Beta Kappa-Society of the Cincinnati
Convocation. Shortened classes will
be held so that students can attend
the voluntary assembly honoring the
Phi Beta Kappa men.

The Phi Beta Kappa picture for
the Calyx will be taken in front
of Washington Hall at 1:00 p.m.
on Friday, March 12.

Phi Beta Kappa is the oldest
Greek-letter fraternity in the United
States. It was founded at William and
Mary in 1776. Early secrecy was
abandoned after criticism, and since
1846 the society has been strictly an
honorary scholastic fraternity. Mem-
bership in Phi Beta Kappa has long
been one of the highest academic
distinctions.

The purpose of the organization is
to recognize and encourage scholar-
ship and cultural interests. Qualifica-
tions for membership are high schol-
schip, liberal culture, and good
character.

Gamma Chapter

Washington and Lee's local chap-
ter, Gamma of Virginia, was found-
ed in 1911 with ten members. Since
that date the chapter has annually
conferred membership on students
| with outstanding academic records. It
now has over 600 living members

Gamma Chapter considers each
graduating class by itself, not by
comparsion with other classes. Elec-
tion is not based on any fixed per-
centage of the class and there is no
strict numerical requirement for
for membership

Election Procedure

Election of academic seniors is
based on seven semesters of work
Occasionally, however, a senior is
chosen who has made an improve-
in his grades during his eighth and
final semester of college. This year
three such students were elected to
membership. Election of LL.B. can-
didates is based primarily upon law

Unjust, Unreasonable

The University Absence Regulations provide that a
student who takes one unexcused absence beyond the
cuts regularly allowed him shall be dropped from the
course he cuts with a grade of “F.” Why? Does it show
in any way that he may not have mastered the material
in the course? Does it even show that he is not performing
the required work in the course? Of course not.

Then why fail the student for one overcut? The
reasoning is obviously that with such a penalty, students
will be careful not to take unexcused absences. This is
true, but it is also true that class attendance could be se-
cured by other means—means which would not needlessly
risk students’ college careers by failing them for one over-
cut. It seems to us that the penalty of overcutting should
be one which is on a level with the seriousness of the
“offense.” To fail a student in a course is much too serious
a punishment for one overcut; it might mean that a man
could flunk out of school for oversleeping one morning.

Moreover, the penalty for overcutting should be one
reasonably related to the “infraction.” That is, since un-
excused absences are really a disciplinary problem, the
penalty should be a disciplinary matter also, not the most
final of academic punishments.

Last year the faculty voted to liberalize the cut system,
giving the majority of students sufficient cuts to allow
them to cut practically as they please, which should be the
right of any man of college age and ability. But at the
same time, the faculty actually tightened up on the rule on
overcuts, reducing the margin at which an “F” will be
awarded from two unexcused absences to only one. There
is little reason and no justice in giving an “F” for over-
cutting in the first place, so why tighten up on the rule?
Again, this is a fear measure to force compliance with the
limits of the new cut system.

We do not believe the students of Washington and
Lee need this rule, nor that they deserve it. If there must
be such a rule at all, it should at least be backed by a pen-
alty fitting for the “infraction” it exists to prevent. Extra
“homework” would be just such a penalty.

 

Fair Election*Plan

The plan for a two-party political system proposed in
the Ring-tum Phi two weeks ago has been attacked for
being impractical. Inevitably such far-reaching reform
will be impractical to many people, since it is impossible to
change without stepping on toes. But opposed to personal
considerations—which are generally the essence of the
plan’s “impracticality”—is the welfare of student govern-
ment itself. Student government demands an improvement
in the corrupt method in which its officers are selected.

We will be the first to admit that the two-party system
plan will be difficult to implement. Indeed what is more
difficult, unwieldy, more impractical than any form of
democratic government? But though it will be difficult to
undertake, the plan is workable—in contrast to the status
quo, which is unbearable.

Basically, the Ring-tum Phi plan, or the Fair Election
Plan, as it has become known, is to establish under the
supervision of the Executive Committee two relatively
equal parties who will nominate their candidates, in open
primaries. To ensure that the Cliques don’t rig primaries
by passing the word as to the “acceptable” candidates,
the primaries will be administered by an Elections Com-
mittee, consisting of EC members from both parties and
the chairman of both parties. Probably such a system
could only be established by a vote of the student body
to incorporate it into the constitution.

Criticism of this plan to date has been aimed mainly
at the original creation of equal parties, and at the compli-
cations involved in a primary system. Both these points
are essential to open and fair elections. The first, creation
of equal parties, is the sine qua non of any improvement.
At present there is only one party, whose candidates are
assured of election; this party can nominate without re-
gard for their candidates’ fitness for office. If there were
equal parties, each party would have to be careful to nom-
inate men qualified for office.

Perhaps the quickest way for equal parties to be cre-
ated is for the EC to ask the nine houses who are presently
not organized to form a new party in opposition to the
University Party. The main objection to such a move is
that these nine houses might not be politically compatible.
However, this objection is a very weak one, since the party
shifts in the last four years have seen every house on
campus affiliated with almost every other house, volun-
tarily, at one time or another.

The second point of criticism is that the primaries are
too much trouble. Certainly a primary election would be
one more election for students to go through, but we
think this is a price worth paying. A primary election for
student body offices would require a meeting of each party
in one place, which may be unprecedented but is certianly
not an impossibility. The commons, the gym, or probably
even Lee Chapel could hold such meetings.

The primary elections for student body and class EC
offices would entail several ballotings in order to allow
men defeated for one nomination to run for a lower nomi-
nation. This would take some time, but not an inordinate
amount of time. It is a process which would probably
excite new interest in campus elections, since it would be
free of Clique control and open for any interested stu-
dent. We believe that students would not begrudge the
extra time, indeed that they might enjoy such primaries,

Apathy Saps Traditional Values

By JIM De YOUNG
Tuesday Columnist

Quality in education concerns
every one of us today. At W&L we
have this quality
and it has been
our strength that
we always have |
been able to pro- |
duce an effective
public image. It
has been our]
weakness at times
that so much em-
phasis has been
placed on this im-
age, and that the
reality has often
failed to measure up to it. This fault
is caused not by re@alcitrance on the
part of our student body but by
apathy and indifference.

   

De Young

Honor Convenient

Students often appear not to ap-
preciate the honor system or con-
ventional dress. However, I do ack-
nowledge the fact that the matter
of academic convenience is more im-

portant than the matter of dress. Yet
in recent articles in the Ring-tum
Phi, there have been numerous de-
fenses made for the honor system
and conventional dress, but in all of
these articles, there has been no
mention of what I consider the ob-
vious.

Above all, the honor system is a
system of convenience and rare priv-
ilege. It is for the students at W&L,
and each boy who comes here is
made aware of the system. Each par-
ent of a student is required to sign
a statement indicating that he under-
stands the workings of the honor
system. And when a boy enters
W&L, he ean be sure that he is
competing on the same level with
every other student. Futhermore,
when a boy leaves W&L, he does
so because he has broken the agree-
ment he tacitly accepted when he
came to Washington and Lee.

Conventional Dress

As for conventional dress, I suggest
that its detractors travel to other
colleges and  universities—Miami,

Cornell, and Princeton—and take a
good look at the students there. The
only observation I can make is that
we are lucky to have conventional
dress there, and that it is no wonder
that the many men who interview
here always comment on how well
a W&L man dresses and handles
himself, and how fortunate the school
is to have such a value inculeated in
its students.

Yet a good many students here
do not really have any sense of pride
regarding either of these values. The
W&L student would do well to be-
come aware of his role as a leader of
tomorrow. Amd he should place
much more value and emphasis on
having a true sense of responsibility.
This responsibility comes only when
the student is able to transcend his
own selfish aims and become aware
of the existence of forces and move-
ments outside of and far more im-
portant than himself. Everyone of us
can contribute our part to maintain-
ing these values and realize just how
valuable and meaningful they are to
us who attend W&L.

For an instant, his whole body
shook violently, then he fell over,
elutehing at his throat and gesturing
wildly at his desk top.

“Quick! Two oranges, three greens
and a purple!” he gasped. I handed
him all the bettles on the desk, but
he just glared at me. “These aren't

the floor, then began crawling
around on all fours, sobbing violent-

“T've lost my marbles,” he whimp-

To the Editer:

The Friday staff of the Ring-tum
Phi published two editorials in its
March 5 edition which indicates
that the Friday edition is grossly
misinformed upon subjects it wishes
to editorialize.

In one editorial entitled, “Tradi-
tional Evesore,” the Friday editor re-
marks concerning the Old Co-op,
“The Ring-tum Phi would like to
ask the administration just what its
plans for the building are? Thus far
ro one really seems to know.” If the
Editor had bothered to attend the
opening University Assembly, he
would have heard President Colc
very definitely remark that next vear
the present University Book Siore
and soda shop would be moved into
the Old Co-op and the ROTC depart-
ment would move into the present
University Book Store to give the li-
brary more space

Student Rights
Are Limited

In Academics

by ROY TYLER
Tuesday Columnist

How far does “academic freedom”
go? The students at the University
of California believe it went far
enough to warrant riots and sit-ins
when they thought it was being
denied.

First, however, what is
freedom” and what does it guaran-
tee? “Academie freedom” can be in-
terpreted to mean and guarantec
anything, just as the word “freedom”
has so many interpretations as people
to interpret it.

One interpretation is that it allows
a professor to teach any subject in
any manner from any point of view
he wishes to teach from. This, how-
ever, can lead to serious problems.

How many times have you heard,
“T really want to take that course,
but the guy who teaches it is a rant-
ing, raving————_"? A great deal
often depends on the position of the
person making the statement, but
certain professors, even entire de-
partments, teach their courses from
one and only one political point of
view.

Does “academic freedom” allow a
professor to slant his teaching to
fit his own political outlook? Does
“academic freedom” allow a profes-
sor to teach a course in such a
manner that it will keep a student
who does not quite agree with the
professor from taking his course?
What if the course is a required one?

There is no reason, however, ‘to ask
for censorship of classroom lectures.
This, needless to say, would be ridic-
ulous. The object of this column is
not to call for any official or even
unofficial action on the part of the
administration, but only to ask the
faculty to restrain themselves from
certain “excesses” with regard to
partisanship in the classroom.

A prime example of this was the
dismissal of a scheduled class prior
to the election. After a short lecture
on the merits of one of the candi-
dates, a professor asked his class to
accompany him to aid in the distri-
bution of literature. One might ex-
pect this during an election, but a
great deal of this has continued.

In some courses a student's grade
is in danger of being lowered if he
merely disagrees with the professor
who teaches the course. This is not
merely rumor but the opinion of past
student leaders who have had to
keep silent when they disagree with
something a professor said beeause
their response would endanger their
grade.

It goes without saving that this
sort of thing should not go on. Na-
turally students want to know both
sides of the picture. If their are
reasons why “right-to-work”
should be maintained, students
would like to hear them instead ol
a constant one-sided criticism of the
laws.

There will be cries of protest con-
cerning the “police state” which
censorship of classwork would en-
tail. But there is no reason for cen-
sorship, only the relization by
fessors that there are two sides to
every picture and there are students
who do not think as they do

With this in mind, could we go
over the section dealing with labor
unions again?

“osceidemie

laws

pro-

 

sity in courses above 150. Thirdly,
the Editor states that it takes only
six hours to complete the
requirement, when the actual re-
quired figure is eight hours.

While admittedly these inaccur-
acies may seem trivial, in the future
the Editor should be well informed
and better informed on subjeets on
which he chooses to write. Needless
10 say, inaccuracies and misquota-
tions in journalism tend to throw a
bad light on a newspaper staff

with the aid of some of the other

ed a program of aid for those who
can help themselves’—the proposed
Medicare bill would provide aid for
all people over sixty-five regardless
of need. He pointed to the fact that
no other benefit program in Ameri-
ca administered to those who did
not really need help.

Mr. Foristel went on to explain
the position of the American Medical
Association which would accept the
bill as feasible only under three con-
ditions: 1. the aid must be restricted
to those who have a need; 2. the
benefits must be administered to
people at a local or state level; 3. it
must not involve the use of Social
Security funds.

Foristel described the Eldercare
or Herlong-Curtis legislation being
supported by the AMA; under this
proposed plan, the elderly group
would be divided into three cate-
gories according to their need as
determined by statements of income
and health, and the medical serv-
ices would be alloted accordingly.
He completed his talk by pointing
out the high standards attained by
modern medicine in the United
States and issued strong encourage-
ment to college graduates to take the
initiative and pursue a career in
medicine—“we have a big decision
confronting us today, for we must

realize that socialized medicine is
never the end of socialism, it’s the
beginning!”

The final panelist was the Honor-
able Jack Marsh, a member of the
House of Representatives from the
Seventh Congressional District, a
graduate in law from Washington
and Lee, a veteran of World War II,
who was recognized as the most out-
standing young man in Virginia | in

JIM REDENBAUGH OR RICK CARRELA,

 

1959. His topic was “What the Ulti-
mate Bill May Be?”, and he began
by saying that we must first examine
the need; the advances of technoligy
have resulted in longevity of life
and thus created a social problem
that must be resolved by the indi-
vidual. Senior citizens who have
need as well as many others are put-
ting pressure on Washington to ar-
rive at a solution suitable to all and
steps are being undertaken to rem-
edy the situation. Rep. Marsh goes
on to suggest feasible approaches in-
cluding a Welfare System, and he
discusses the advantages of the
omnibus King-Anderson bill which
s “a highly technical piece of legis-
lation.”

The Medicare bill is a Revenue
Bill emerging from the Ways and
Means committee, and Rep. Marsh
mentioned that the voting by sec-
tions on the bill would begin short-
ly. He went on to say that the final
product would probably be a hybrid
of the various bills now under con-
sideration; he concluded by saying
that “we need a dedication and a re-
dedication in re-emphasis on the
pursuit of a career in medicine.”

The symposium was followed by
a short period in which students
were given an opportunity to ask
questions and express their opinions.

Letters To The Editor

\things taught,

 

The debate is open to all students | ary interest, and in addition meant
and faculty and especially those con- jas a compliment to you and to the

will be ample opportunity for dis- |

the values of which
occur later.

I do not challenge your question-
ing the reason. In fact, 1 now wonder
at my own dullness for not having
done so. However, I do submit a
reversal of your thesis. I suggest in-
stead of the need for innovations in
our significant systems, it may be in
some cases more important to pro-
vide protections.

In this instance, after submitting
the practice to thorough review you
were to find it time proven and de-
serving, then the issue should be-
come one of preservation. The mean-
ingfulness of conventional dress ten
years ago or in Lee’s time is in
question today. Innovation and
change is suggested, so that man-
ner of dress might conform with the
need of the present. This is an up-
grading of an idea and conforms with
the principles of progress. However,
who will preserve the benefits of
today’s innovation, ten years hence?
The answer might be, let there be
another innovation ten years hence
to meet the condition of that day,
and so on. If that is the real answer,
then the final question has to be;
is there no place for the continuity
of a proven idea ‘to be passed from
one generation to another?

My letter does not ask for an
answer or acknowledgement. It is
merely an expression of contempor-

others in your student body who, it
is apparent, are thinking.
