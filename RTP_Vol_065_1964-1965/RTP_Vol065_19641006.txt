Veeps Named
For Openin gs
By President

The President of the Soph-
omore Class and of Openings
Weekend, Bill Jeffress, an-
nounced his choice of one jun-
ior and four sophomores to

serve as Vice-Presidents of
Openings, October 16 and 17. Jeffress,
who has signed James Brown, has
promised an outstanding weekend
to start off the year.

Joe Miller, a junior Delta Tau
Delta, is head of the cocktail party
committee. The cocktail party will
take place at the Moose Lodge Fri-
day afternoon from 4:00 to 6:00. The
Duo-Tones will provide the enter-
tainment during the first party of the
weekend.

To arouse curiosity the Decora-
tions Committee, under the di-
rection of Roger Milam, a Delt
Sophomore, has decided to keep
the theme of the dance a secret.
Milam has let it be known that
the theme would carry out a cur-
rently popular subject.

Music for the dance Friday night
will be provided by the Saints and
Sinners. The dance will be held in
Doremus Gymnasium from 9:00 to
1:00 and for the first time in some
years the dance will be semi-form-
al.

The feature part of the Friday
night dance will be the nationally
famous Shirelles, who will perform
when the Saints and Sinners take
their intermission breaks, which will
be the last twenty minutes of every
hour.

The Publicity Committee is headed
by Pete Taylor, a KA Sophomore.

Students Go Republican,

But LB]

Barry Increases Percentage
In Final Tally of Poll

by Wendell Winn
Staff Reporter

Final results of the Tuesday edi-
tion’s straw poll between Johnson
and Goldwater gave the Republican
candidate 59 per cent of all votes
cast, but in a faculty vote President
Johnson scored an even more im-
pressive margin, sweeping 80 per
cent of the faculty votes.

The student poll was conducted
last Friday with 439 votes cast for
Goldwater and 293 for Johnson. The
faculty poll, taken at yesterday’s
faculty meeting, was 68 to 17 in
favor of the President.

The poll, which was arranged
and sponsored by the Tuesday
edition of the Ring-tum Phi, con-

 

sisted of two voting stations: one

in front of Washington Hall and
the other at the entrance of the
Freshman Quad.

All undergraduates, law and grad-
uate students were eligible to vote.
A good percentage of the students
took time to indicate their preference
for President in the upcoming elec-
tion, for 66 per cent of the entire
student body participated.

The Frosh went Goldwater 2-1,
the Sophomores: 5-4, the Jun-
iors: 6-5, the Seniors: 3-2, and the
Law students: 3-2. The returns
from the faculty ballots indicated
an opinion which was in marked
contrast with that of the student
body as a whole; instructors in
R.0.T.C, and Physical Ed. are in-
cluded in the faculty count in
which only 17 or 20 per cent of
their votes were cast for Gold-
water and 68 or 80 per cent were
cast for Johnson. Their ratio was
4-1 for Johnson.

Committee To Review
Use Of Student Funds

The appointment of a_ student!
body Finance Committee has been!
ennounced by Jim Kulp, student
body president. The main purpose of
the committee, says Kulp, will be
to review the budgets of all organi-
zations which draw money from the
student body funds.

The new Finance Committee, the
makeup of which was determined
by the EC, consists of Mr. Sam
Rayder of the Rockbridge Nation-
al Bank, who is treasurer of the
student body fund; Jim DeYoung,
vice president of the student body
and the officer in charge of stu-
dent body spending; Fred Min-
del, EC member from the junior
class; Jere Turner and Mark Ap-
plefeld, members of the Publica-
tion Board.

Earlier this year Kulp discovered

that there has been no check on the |

spending of the student body funds
for a number of years, and that the
student body Finance Committee,
which is designated in the Constitu-
tion of the student government, had
been allowed to become defunct.

Prog ressive’s

Elect Officers

The Progressive Party, the min-
ority campus political party, an-
nounced its officers for the 1964-65
school year last night. The party
elected John Heinzerling, Chairman
and Frank Bailey, Secretary-Treas-
urer.

 

Heinzerling, an SAE freshman law
student from Houston, Texas, is a
dorm counselor and a member of the
Student Control Committee this year.
He has also served in past years |
as President and Vice-President of
his fraternity.

Bailey, a Kappa Sigma junior from
Fort Worth, Texas, is presently vice-|
president of his fraternity. He served |
in a high capacity on the famed
Texas Delegation of last year's mock
convention

Heinzerling and Bailey expres- |
sed confidence that the Progres-
sive Party would continue to put
ferth the best qualified candidates
for student body and class officers.
“Hf the time ever came when an
inferior candidate had to be pre-
sented, the party would not nom-
inate rather than cast off the
reputation it has gained for bring-
ing to the student bedy's atten-
tion only the most outstanding
men.

 

“We were most pleased with the
results of last year's elections. These
indicated to us that the student
body will vote for the man and not
the party. We hope that such will be
the case in the upcoming election in
the freshman Heinzerling
stated. The Progressive Party is
now composed of five houses fac-
ing the “Big Clique” ten-house Lib-|
erty Party

class,”

The Progressives include the Phi)
Gams, the Kappa Sigs, the SAE’s,

| the Phi Psi's, and the Zebes i

 

Kulp explained to the Ring-tum
Phi that the EC felt that this situa-

tion was encouraging careless spend- |

ing and wastage. Some organizations,
he said, are spending needlessly be-
cause they know they are entitled
to a certain amount of money; other
organizations are under-financed be-

cause of outmoded distribution ratios. |
which draw|

The organizations
money from the student body funds
are the Calyx, the Ring-tum Phi, the
Southern Collegian, the Glee Club
the Debate Team, the Cheerleaders,
the Student Bar Association, and the
Executive Committee. Some of these
organizations take almost no money
from the funds available, but oth-
ers—the three publications in par-
ticular—require student funds sup-
port for continued existence.

The student body fund is the re-
cipient of a ten dollars activities fee
from each student in the fall, paid in
the registration Ine. The percentage
of the fund available to each organi-
zation, according to Mr. Rayder, has
not changed since World War II.

Investigate Spending

The Finance Committee plans to
begin an investigation of financial
procedures of the Dance Board and
the Publications Board, particularly

considering the salaries paid by both |

bodies.

Kulp, however, stressed that the
committee has not been set up for
investigative purposes, but in “an
attempt to follow the constitution”
and to bring order and effectiveness
to student government.

Sweeps Faculty

It was evident from the results of
the early returns on Friday that
Lyndon Johnson was not going to
suffer the overwhelming defeat that
many Goldwater supporters had an-
ticipated and thus the LBJ-men
were encouraged by the hope that
he might narrow the margin after
the afternoon votes had been tab-
ulated. The final results, however,
did not vary greatly from the earl-
ier 55 per cent talley in favor of
Goldwater.

These results, needless to say,
came as quite a surprise to many
who were confident that the Ari-
zona Senator’s majority would be
much greater. Not including fresh-
men, a total of 450 students voted
with 256 or 56 per cent going for
Goldwater and 194 or 44 per cent
supporting Johnson. It is evident
that it was the vote of the Fresh-
man class which threw such great
emphasis upon the Republican vic-
tory, for it had the largest repre-
sentation at the poll, casting 183
votes or 64.8 per cent for Gold-
water and 99 or 35.2 per cent for
Johnson.

About half of the Sophomores en-
tered their preference with 85, 56.3
per cent, votes for the Arizona Sen-
ator and 66, 43.7 per cent, votes for
LBJ. The Junior Class had a fair
turnout; 63 went for Goldwater and
52 stood by Johnson. 74 out of the
Senior Class supported Goldwater
and 52 supported Johnson.

Not very many from the law school
voted: 34 were for Goldwater and 23
east their ballots for Johnson.

These results are indicative of the
conservative trend which has dom-
inated the political outlook at Wash-
ington and Lee for many years. Al-
though Goldwater won by a respec-
table margin, it is obvious that
Johnson can claim enthusiastic and
significant support at W&L. In the
| next straw poll, which is scheduled
closer to the actual election date,
| November 3, the results may be even
| closer.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Walk Out on Hazing

The sophomores of 18 fraternities have al-
ready begun to take their annual revenge on
the freshmen. Now the pledges of each fra-
ternity will have to pay for the fact that last
year, the present sophomores suffered through
hazing; and that now they are in a position
to have their own fun. A column in the Friday
Ring-tum Phi urging that the pledges refuse
to submit evidently has had little effect so far;
several fraternities have already held “rallies”
without protest on the part of the victims.

But it’s never too late. If the freshmen take
the advice given them by the Friday column-
ist, they can avoid repetations of these dark-
age ordeals. If they organize and give the
death-blow to rallies, they will better prove
themselves worthy of fraternity membership
than if they meekly endure all the degrada-
tion, the wasted time and effort which the
sophomores hold so dear.

And if the fraternities themselves will admit
the worthlessness of physical ordeals and of
degrading the freshmen, they will have pre-
sented one of the best evidences possible that
they are worthy of continued existence at this
University and at all schools. They will have
proved that they are capable of discarding the
useless husks of the past and of accepting the
reality of the present. Fraternities can do
this by replacing hazing with purely constrc-
tive pledge programs. In the long run the
benefits from such a change are enormous—
including earning the respect of the adminis-
tration and faculty, and also improvement of
the physical facilities of each fraternity, by
the work of the pledges.

Yet if the fraternities refuse change—then
the freshmen are bound to take the initiative.
Sooner or later the pledges are going to walk
out on hazing—it only takes one concerted
effort—and they are going to insist on intelli-
gent and constructive pledge programs. The
sooner the better.

A Victory In Disguise

The results of Friday’s Johnson-Goldwater
poll on campus were genuinely heartening to
supporters of Lyndon Johnson, despite the
fact that Goldwater carried 58 per cent of the
750 students who voted. Johnson men fig-
ured that if Goldwater can carry only 58 per
cent of Washington and Lee, a traditionally
conservative and Republican school, he stands
to take a severe beating in terms of the na-
tional electorate on November 3. The student
mock election, then, was really a victory for
Johnson, even though the President carried
only 42 per cent of the votes cast.

The significance of Washington and Lee
results can be seen only in comparison with
the results of past election polls of the student
body. In 1952, General Eisenhower, the Re-
publican conservative candidate, carried over
75 per cent of Washington and Lee students
in a mock election. During the 1956 election
there were apparently no polls taken, but pre-
sumably Eisenhower maintained somewhat of
a lead over Mr. Stevenson. In 1960 Richard
Nixon also carried over 75 per cent of stu-
dents here; once again the Republican, the
conservative, ran far stronger at Washington
and Lee than he did in the nation. If Senator
Goldwater's strength at this school is running
as far ahead of his national strength as did
Eisenhower's and Nixon’s, the Republican
nominee faces a national landslide for John-
son. And why shouldn’t Washington and Lee
show Goldwater running far ahead of his na-
tional strength? The student body hasn't
changed so drastically in four years; it is still
conservative and—though less strongly —Re-
publican, The Young Republilcans have been
more active than the Young Democrats, and
they are much, much stronger in terms of
numbers. The Conservative Society here has
been pushing Goldwater incessantly for over
three years now. Goldwater's failure to win
more than 60 per cent of the votes at Wash-
ington and Lee, a natural stronghold for him,
foretells a weak national showing in Novem.
ber.

In a separate poll of the faculty, Senator
Goldwater received only a small fraction of
votes. There is little doubt that the faculty
has never before been so closely united on one
candidate in a national election; this in spite
of the fact that in 1960 the Washington and
Lee faculty went to Richard Nixon, not the
more liberal Mr. Kennedy. All this is enough
to make us believe that the national polls
showing President Johnson with over 60 per
cent of the decided voters, must be correct,
There is a tendency to discount such polls-

but this year it is hard to see how they could
be wrong.

With these polls hanging darkly over his
head—yesterday’s Gallup Report showed him
with 32 per cent of the votes—Senator Gold-
water is saying nothing to encourage support.
It is refreshing to watch a political candidate
stick to his guns to the end—but in doing so
the Senator convinces us more and more
that he is not a reasonable choice for the
presidency. Last week at Cincinnati he con-
demned the Democratic administration for
trying to come to an “accommodation” with
the Soviet Union. How the Senator plans to
continue his and the nation’s existence without
accommodation is uncertain. But he makes it
crystal-clear that in his mind there is not room
on earth for both American democracy and
Russian Communism as it exists today, And
he is also clear on what he would do about
“accommodation”: if elected, Goldwater pro-
poses to call a quick NATO conference to
“mobilize the resources of the free world”
against Communism. It need not be said that
this is precisely the attitude which could lead
the country into a war: unless the U.S. and
the Soviet Union accommodate their differ-
ences, their conflict must inevitably reach the
stage at which one side or the other will resort
to arms.

It is his inability to see the other side which
made Goldwater a loner in the Senate, which
precluded his being a truly influential senator.
This explains the fact that no important legis-
lation bears his name. Mr. Goldwater indeed
suffers in comparison with Lyndon Johnson,
whose abilities were quickly recognized by his
fellow Senators, and who was acclaimed as
one of the ablest Majority Leaders in Senate
history. Goldwater’s single dissenting votes in
the Senate prove him one of the most cour-
ageous men in Washington; but they contrast
very bleakly with Johnson’s success in the pas-
sage of legislation, both as Majority Leader
and as President. For two terms Barry Gold-
water stood in the Senate and said “No!” to
the American people; now it is time for the
American people to say “No!” to Senator
Goldwater.

The New Rush System

The I.F.C. rush report published in last
Friday’s Ring-tum Phi was a much-needed
comment on a subject that has hardly been
broached this fall. It is rather surprising that
there has not been more discussion of the
newly revised rush system, since rush week is
so important to the fraternity men on cam-

us.
, The LF.C. report did mention the problem
created for the houses which did not have
the “big national name.” As might be expect-
ed, these houses had a lesser percentage of
freshmen sign up to see them for open houses.
These same houses began with somewhat of a
disadvantage under the old system and the
new system has certainly not helped the sit-
uation for them. The only solution to the
problem seems to be to require freshmen to
see all eighteen houses during the open house
period.

Such a requirement would involve a number
of other difficulties that arose over rush week.

Either there would have to be an extra day|~

of open houses (probably meaning an extra

day of rush week) or the open houses would

have to be shortened. The second alternative
is out of the question since the general opin-
ion during rush week seemed to be that the
open houses were too short as they stood.

The open houses were especially short for
the houses that had to walk the freshmen to
and from the dorms. These houses usually
found that they had only about a half an hour
to meet more boys than are normally at a rush
date. This confusion almost defeated the basic
and commendable idea behind the open
houses. Thus it would seem a more needed
change to lengthen the actual open house peri-
ods than to lengthen the intervals between
them, as the IFC has considered.

The addition of only ten minutes to the
open house period would not only make the
open houses more successful, but would also
do away with many of the time-limit viola.
tions which occured during the open house
period this year.

All things considered, the new rush system
and schedule are vast improvements over the

old system, The freshmen especially seemed |
| for a treasure in Prague, under the

to comprehend the system, which speaks
well of the LF.C.’s work during the summer
and at freshman camp. Those few kinks that
do remain in the system will hopefully be
worked out by the LF.C. before next year.

Gravy Train Politics Hit By Lamb

by Lamar Lamb
Tuesday Columnist

Washington and Lee has long been
plagued with an inefficient and cor-
rupt method of choosing its cam-
pus leaders. Men have been chosen
as nominees of the
various political
parties purely on
the basis of fra-
ternity (as a
member of a cer-
tain house or be-
cause of having
- no fraternal mem-
bership).

Many times par-
ties have nomin-
ated men who
were completely
unqualified and incapable of doing
the job at hand. Many times the best
candidate has been left to sit and
wonder in silence because it was not
his house’s “turn” or because eight
or nine men of average intelligence,
or worse decided he wasn’t the man
they wanted in office.

The political parties, as is well
known, are run by one represen-
tative from each fraternity, in an
atmosphere of secrecy, double-
dealing, conniving, and under-
handedness. This pitiful and ri-
diculous picture could indeed be
seen as a laughable mockery were
it not for the few officials of real
significance on campus—offices |
which are filled by the selections |

 

of our heroes of the smoke-filled
rooms,

Choices of Expediency

The fruits of the present system
are sundry and bitter. Our student
government works like an old auto-
mobile: some parts work, some
don’t. The political parties often
manage to put in a truly qualified
person, but many times don’t. In
any case, the good as well as the
bad is largely accidental, because the
basis for choice is most often ex-
pediency or an outright power push.

Another harmful effect is that
many people who would be intelli-
gent and efficient office holders and
who would like to do things for the
school, just don’t have the chance.
This inevitably brings on a third re-
sult which always occurs with tight
control and corruption. It is that the
student body at large develops a
cynical indifference to campus poli-
tics in general. For very good rea-
son, the attitude grows that “It
doesn’t concern me anyway.” Poli-
tics at W&L is a realm of activity
that can concern only a small num-
ber of students—a sort of power elite
who stubbornly cling to a stagnant
system, because in that system rests
their whole justification.

Open Primaries

What is the solution to this prob-
lem? Many men who are aware of
the problems our student govern-
ment faces believe that a system of

open primaries should be instituted
to choose the candidates for of-
fice. I am one who believes that this
would be a long step in the right
direction. It would allow students to
have some say in who represents
them, and it would give the genu-
inely intersted candidate a chance
to express their views and their in-
terest.

In partial answer to this prob-
lem, both editions of the Ring-
tum Phi are supporting a primary
for freshman EC elections. In two
weeks, the representative for the
freshman class to the Executive
Committee will be sworn in. Hope-
fully, though this primary, the
new representative will be one
who is the genuine choice of his
class and not the toy of oligarchs.

Preferential Ballots

There is a ballot printed in this
paper for Freshmen to fill out in
order to express their preference in
the upcoming election. Hopefully,
the freshmen will participate in this
effort to assure Washington and Lee
of a truly representative and efficient
government.

Perhaps the class of ’68 will be
the first freshman class in Wash-
ington and Lee to choose its own
representative. For the good of the
class, for the good of Washington
and Lee, the freshmen will throw
off the unreasonable and unneces-
sary repression of party politics.

Maybe It’s Hidden Under Y our Own Stove

by Bert Phillips
Tuesday Columnist

The other day a Lexington Sage
told me a story which made quite
an impression, and I shall relate it
to you since we all love stories

“Rabbi Bunam used to tell young
men who came to him for the first
time the story of Rabbi Eizik, son
of Rabbi Yekel of Cracow. After
many years of great poverty which
had never shaken his faith in God,
he dreamed someone bade him look
bridge which leads to the king's
palace

When the dream occurred a third
time, Rabbi Eizik prepared for the
journey and set out for Prague. But
the bridge was guarded day and)

night and he did not dare to start
digging. Nevertheless he went to
the bridge every morning and kept
walking around it until evening
Finally the captain of the guards,
who had been watching him, asked
in a kindly way whether he was
looking for something or waiting
for somebody

Rabbi Eizik told him of the dream
which had brought him here from

a far away country. The captain
laughed: ‘And so to please the
dream, you, poor fellow, wore out
your shoes to come here! As fo:
having faith in dreams, if I had had
it, I should have had to get going
when a dream once told me to go to
Cracow and dig for treasure under
the stove in the room of a Jew

Eizik, son of Yekel, that was the
name! Eizek, son of Yekel! I can just

imagine what it would be like. how
I should have to try every house
over there where one half the Jews
are named Ejizik and the other Yek-
el!’ And he laughed again

Rabbi Eizik bowed, traveled hame.
dug up the treasure from under the
stove, and built the House of Praver
which is called ‘Reb Eizik Reb Reb
Yekel's Shul!’

‘Take this story to heart.’ Rabbi
Bunam used to add, ‘and make what
it says your own: There is something
you cannot find anywhere in the
world, not even at the Zoddik’s and

there is, ne verthele
you can find it’”

Last Minute Passing Attack

Woodberry Forest, 13-7;
Brings Tiger Victory

by Dave Dougherty
Tuesday Sports Writer
Before a sparce opening day gathering on Wilson Field
Saturday, the Washington and Lee freshmen fell to a last min-
ute onslaught by Woodberry Forest which brought the visiting

Tigers a 13-7 victory.
The win was the second in a

row for coach Red Caughron’s

Bengals, who are always a Virginia prep titan. In taking this

bout, Woodberry had to penetrate®
a rugged General defense which had
quieted the potent Tiger thrust for
three quarters. The Foresters fin-
ally turned the trick by mixing
a strong passing attack with power-
ful off-tackle blasts.

Coach Dana Swan's Generals, led
by signal caller Tom Pittman, had
several wisps of glory in the open-
ing half, but it was basically a de-
fensive struggle which saw only one
major break. A W&L fumble deep
in its own territory gave Wood-
berry a good opportunity. However,

the strong W&L defense, aided
by two  fifteen-yard penalties,
pushed the Tigers into a fourth-and-
thirty-nine situation which was
hushed by the first-half gun.

With Pittman running the keeper
to perfection and hitting his targets
with flawless aerials, the Generals
quickly took the initiative in the
second half and scored midway in
the third quarter on a two-yard

 

burst by quarterback Pittman.| tle time remaining.

 

 

Throughout the sixty-yard drive the
Generals were led by the powerful
running of Jim Elliott and Luke
Crosland, who added the seventh
point with a perfect placement.

The roof fell in for Washington
and Lee in the final quarter as Will
Lassiter started hitting his big ends,
Temple Grassi and Hy Young, with
look-in and flare passes and Ron
Fisher and John MacCorkle started
breaking the General bulwark Fish-
er scored the first Woodberry tal-
ly with a three-yard burst, but a
stiff rush caused a poor PAT effort
and the Generals held a slim 7-6
lead.

W&L was forced to relinquish the
ball with less than four minutes re-
maining in the game, and the Tigers
began a devastating air attack. From
the one MacCorkle took it in for the
victory. Lassiter’s successful kick
made the score 13-7 with very lit-

The Best Sports News On Campus

 

 

by

A member of the athletic department was asking the other day why
the student body here seems to be nonchalant about the sporting events.
He just couldn’t understand why no one comes to see the games. The
only answer he received was that there is no school spirit at W&L.

For the freshmen who haven’t heard, attendance is just plain lousy
at almost every athletic activity. The football games attract a surpris-
ingly small percentage of the student body and most of these “true”
fans leave at halftime, no matter what the score may be. It is true
that in the past W&L has not been noted for exciting football. The run-
ning backs and linemen have been the type of players that make ball
control advantageous.

The idea of football is to win anyway you can. This season, though,
it appears that the Generals will be playing more open ball because of
a general lack of size in the line and because of a passer like Larry
Craig and receivers like Bill David. Still the crowds will be sparse.

Canfield Plans a Fast Basketball Game

Basketball never draws well because the team doesn’t win. Also the
slow down style of last year is not particularly conducive at attracting
spectators. Coach Verne Canfield has the solution to draw a crowd. He
wants his own pep band and also wants to have the football team as an
organized rooting section. He intends to utilize the fast break more than
it has been used in recent seasons. The fast break is a definite crowd
pleaser.

The remainder of the sports, with the exception of wrestling, attract
very few people. Yet, the soccer and lacrosse teams have been having
good success in recent years.

Will This Year Be Any Different

Some players quit because they seem to think that their coach will
let them play even though they come to only half the practice sessions.

For the skeptical freshmen who don’t believe that there is little school
spirit here, attend the opening home football game on October 17
against Susquehanna. The Crusaders walloped Randolph-Macon, 42-0, in
their opener, and Macon defeated the Generals, 8-0, in W&L’s opener.

Add to that the fact that the seventeenth is Opening’s Weekend, and
you can guess about what size crowd will be there for the game, and about
how many will be there by halftime.

Or will this year be different?

Miscues Slow First-Half Drives

By Skip Chase
Tuesday Sports Writer
After a rather lackluster first half, Washington and Lee
came alive in the second half Saturday to score three touch-
downs on its way to a 21-0 victory over Oberlin College. It
was the General’s first victory this season and evened their
overall record at one win and one loss.

W&L’s stout defensive withheld repeated assaults by Ober-
lin and the referees in the first half.*

 

 

In the opening five minutes the ref-
erees gained more yards than the
Yeomen as th Generals were pen-
alized ninety yards. W&L also ad-
ded to their own woes with a fum-
ble and pass interception. Indeed,
the Blue and White did everything
but allow Oberlin yardage.

The Generals drove down the field
in the third quarter only to be stop-
ped on the four-yard line. A short
Oberlin punt gave the General
“Blue” team another chance, and
this time they scored on a fourth
down pass play—Larry Craig to Bill
David—from the Yeoman five. Cary
Green added to conversion and the
Generals took command.

Sparks Scores Second TD

Oberlin failed to move following
the kickoff and punted to the visi-
tors’ “Go” team, who went. Run-
ning outside the second unit rolled
down field; each play moving the
Oberlin linebackers wider and wid-
er. Then, two successive fullback

 

Harriers Cop Third Win

W&L’s cross country team won its
third straight meet of the season
defeating Lynchburg College, 21-40,
Saturday on Wilson Field.

The Generals took seven of the
first nine places. Captains Andy Kil-
patrick and Riff O’Connor placed
first and second respectively with
times of 25:17 and 25.36.

Since W&L was without two of its
five performers—-Lee Johnson and
Charlie Head, the Generals displayed
top performance in a team effort.
Next Friday the Generals travel to
Bridgewater College.

 

 

traps up the middle sent Tom Sparks
into the end-zone. Green’s second
conversion attempt went wide, but
but W&L now led 13-0.

Oberlin then mounted a drive that
took them to the W&L thirty-yard
line. An exchange of punts gave the
Blue and White another chance from
their own forty with some six min-
utes left in the game. A series of
jabs that included several passes
to David and one to Tersh Baker
put W&L on the Oberlin five. From
there fullback John Anthony, the
Generals leading ground-gainer,
banged for six on the identical trap
play that scored Sparks. Skip Chase
had his path swept clean by blocks
on the way in for the two point con-
version. The Generals’ third unit
amassed still another drive before
time ran out with Washington and
Lee in possession.

Next Saturday the traveling men
from W&L will journey to Danville,

| Kentucky, for their third straight

away game this season. The Wash-
ington and Lee-Centre contest
marks the Generals’ first contest with
a College Athletic Conference op-
ponent. Centre opened its confer-
ence slate by losing last Saturday
to Southwestern, 28-7. Earlier the
Colonels dropped a game to Mary-
ville, 21-6, and played to a 0-0 tie
with Wilmington.

‘Civil War Round Table, Meets

To Discuss This

W&L Civil War “buffs” now have |
an outlet for their energies in the|
newly organized Washington and|
Lee Civil War Round Table. Under |
the advisorship of Dr. Charles Turn-
er, Professor of History, the club)
will meet monthly to discuss various |
aspects of Civil War study. Meet-
ings will be held on the last Tues-
day of every month.

The first meeting of the W&L Civil
War Round Table took place last
night in duPont 1. Those attending
included Charles Lewis, '68; Nat
Clement, ’67; Michael Herman, ’67;
Robert A. Davis, 68; Peter H. Hol-
ler, ’68; and Steven R. Saunders,
68.

Lewis and Saunders were desig-
nated to arrange for the speaker and
program at the October 27 meeting.
It was decided that programs will be
limited to one hour

Variety of Projects

Projects discussed ran the gamut
from fieldtrips to nearby battle sites
and historical landmarks, to the pre-
sentation of vintage motion picture
films relating to the Civil War peri-
od.

Among future programs will be
talks by local and nationally known
historians.

Operating with no formal adminis-
trative hierarchy, the club plans to
function as a small group so that
each member may derive the great-
est benefits from his membership.

The group is billed as non-parti-
san, and non-political. Interested
students may address inquiries to

time the team had to come from be-
hind to win.
Team Effort Brought Victory

“All out team effffort, anticipation,
and experience gave us victory,”
said Coach Lyles. The game could
have gone either way for the Gen-
erals or Yellow Jackets, but the
right breaks, hustling, and the will
to win paid off. The team has the
possibility to go undefeated. But as
Coach Lyles emphasized, “The team
is taking each game one at a time.
It is not looking toward any one par-
ticular game.”

Thursday the Generals play host
to Belmont Abbey here at 3:15. This
is a rescheduled game due to Guil-
ford College’s dropping its soccer
program.

Movies Have Peculiar Reality Which Other Media Lack

so, and thus I consider it a great
work of art.

For some, literature is the me-
dium, for some it is painting, for
some it is music, but film, I would
suggest, is the art form which all,
(or most, or at any rate, more) can
appreciate. Not that it comes auto-
matically or easily. It doesn’t. But
the film has a peculiar reality which
other artistic mediums somehow
lack. Perhaps this is because words,
sounds, sights, and motion are all
combined in the motion picture,
something that literature, painting
and music can’t do. (The theater is
another matter for another day.) And
it is this peculiar reality which gives
to the film its universal intelligibili-
ty. All this, of course, is just my own
opinion, and to those who disagree
I can only say—go, look, think, and
then judge for yourself.

They're headed for the primrose path but they'll wind up picking flowers. That's
knowing what to do and when to do it. That's being clean-white-sock. An attitude
that colors everything you do no matter what color your socks. And you get it only
from Adler. Here all feet wear the Adler SC shrink controlled wool sock. Clean

white or in eighteen colors, $1.
