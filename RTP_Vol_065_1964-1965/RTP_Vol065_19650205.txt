After Heinzerling Resigns

Last Monday’s regular EC meeting
reached decisions regarding a new
representative to that group from the
Freshman Law Class, an audititing of
the budgets and accounts of the vari-
ous university organizations and clubs,
and a follow-up discussion of the re-
sults of a recent student body refer-
endum on the role of the Assimilation
Committee in university life.

EC President Jim Kulp announced
last night that Peter Martone, a new
student from Norfolk, was elected to

 

 

 

Town Problem
May Require
Closed Parties

Dean of Students Edward Atwood
warned the Interfraternity Coun-
cil Monday night that continued
trouble between Buena Vista and
Lexington high school students
and the individual fraternities could
lead the school organizations into
serious trouble.

Atwood reported that several in-
cidents of violence had been re-
ported over the Fancy Dress Week-
end. Atwood stated that the fra-
ternities were not responsible for
the actions but the admittance of
teenagers into frat parties could lead
to serious charges against them for

 

serving alcohol to minors. This pen-
alty could bring immediate closing |
of those houses involved.

In an interview with the Ring- —
Phi IFC president Steve Hibbard
stated that this is becoming an in-
creasingly difficult problem due to
the negligence of the fraternities in
taking pains to keep uninvited per-
sonnel from crashing their parties.
Hibbard suggested that each frater-
nity representative bring this prob-
lem to the attention of his house in
an attempt to minimize future trouble.

In addition, Hibbard plans to write
letters to the Lexington and Buena
Vista papers explaining the situation.
If future incidents arise, it may be-
come necessary for visitors to pre-
sent their college LD.’s to be ad-;
mitted to the parties on big week-
ends

Still on the subject of Fancy Dress
woes, it was noted that $300 was
stolen from fraternity houses over
the wekend, mostly from the purses
of girls whose dates failed to make
sure that the purses were not left
out where they could be pilfered)
by any stray individual who might)
wander in. Sheets reminding the
girls of this danger are being plan-
ned for posting at all the neighbor-
ing girls’ schools before big week-
ends.

the EC in a special election yesterday
to replace former member John Hein-

school this semester.

Plans are also underway for the
Committee to collect and audit all the
books and accounts of each school
group for the past semester. Work is
being done on this now with the ten-
tative completion date set for February
15.

In what was perhaps the most im-
portant decision of the Monday meet-
ing, the Committee made plans to re-
view and evaluate the results of the
student body referendum of Decem-
ber 13 regarding a possible change
in the powers and purposes of the As-
similation Committee and, if need be,
the student attitude toward the neces-
sity of the conventional dress tradition
itself.

Final results of the referendum will
be presented to the EC at next Mon-
day’s meeting. Kulp emphasized that
particular attention will be paid to
Section No. 2 of the write-in ballots to
see if there is any one general trend
in the way of new ideas on conven-
tional dress and assimilation. While
there is no way of telling exactly what
the outcome will be—if there is to be
any change—Kulp said that this issue
will be given a great deal of considera-
tion before any final decision is
reached.

DANCE BOARD NOTICE

The Dance Board advises all stu-
| dents who plan to have dates staying
in the Lexington area during the
Springs Weekend (April 23-24) to get
rooms in town immediately. VMI's
Spring Weekend occurs on the same
weekend and will create a severe
rooming shortage.

Bus Service
To Operate
Each Weekend

For the remainder of this semester.
bus service will be provided to and
from the local girl's schools on the
weekends. On regular weekends, buses
will arrive from the girl’s schools at
1:00 p.m. and return to them at 11:45
p.m. The service which is sponsored
by the Interfraternity Council will cost
$1.25 one-way and $2.00 round-trip.

The bus service is not totally new.
It was experimented with last semes-
ter. Since then the program has been
improved and many of the defects
ironed out.

A major change in the revised pro-
gram is that transportation will now
be provided from the girl's schools and
not just back to them. Also students
will no longer have to sign up for the
service ahead of time. A regular sched-
ule has planned, taking into
consideration the activities of all the
schools involved, so that anyone wish-
ing to use the buses only has to board
the bus at the scheduled time

Schedules

been

for this semester are
available at the Corner Grill and at
the three clothing stores here in Lex-

ington.

Chaffin Sees
Heavy Activity
As Necessary

The snow now covering this Lex-
ington campus seems no more
blanketing than Washington and
Lee’s debate program for the sec-
ond semester. The program will at-
tain a “new look” according to
coach William Chaffin in one of a
flurry of announcements issued from
his office this week.

“We have been pleased with the
program thus far”; said Chaffin,
“however, we hope to expand it to
include more people during the next
semester.”

Chaffin said he plans more activity
both on the intercollegiate and cam-
pus levels.

“Intensive practice and research is
what makes a winner,” commented
Chaffiin. “We have some of the best
personnel on the East Coast and we
hope to prove it this Spring. How-
ever, in order to accomplish this
we're going to have to practice and
do quite a bit of case research.”

He went on to explain that a
winning combination was hard to at-
tain because there were not enough
intercollegiate tournaments to allow
each individual student to attain
his full potential. Chaffin believes

 

local tourneys will help solve this!

problem.

Rick Kneipper and Billy Cannon
were given R. E. Lee Research
| Scholarships in other debate activity
and join Dave Marchese, Sam Fra-
zier, Bill Grant and Alan Cohen
on the team’s central staff. Kneipper,
a Lambda Chi senior from Port
Charlotte, Fla., will head the pro-
gram’s research department. Cannon,
|a Phi Ep junior from Culpeper, Va.,
will serve as the freshman team
coordinator and publicity director.

In an interview with the Ring-
itum Phi Thursday Cannon said a

local novice tournament has ben
scheduled for Wednesday February
| 10.

“The tournament is open to any
i student who hasn't debated intercol-
legiately this year whether they've
| been involved in other phases of the
idebate program or whether they
| believe that they'd like to give it a
itry,” Cannon said.

“Times” Editor To Speak
On “Presidential Politics”

BY TOM DOSS
Thomas G. Wicker, Chief of the Washington Bureau of
The New York Times and author of Kennedy Without Tears
has accepted an invitation to speak at CONTACT according

Mr. Wicker’s address is to be
An Evolving Concept.”

Wicker’s ac-
ceptance, Brownell stated that “Mr.
Wicker is unusually capable in the
area of Presidential politics. Repre-
senting a newspaper that many con-
sider the finest in the world, he will
be able to bring to CONTACT a
sense of proximity to power.”
“Mr. Wicker has also expressed
his willingness to talk with people
interested in journalism and politics

on an informal basis,’ Brownell
added.

Born June 18, 1826, in Hamlet,
North Carolina, Mr. Wicker is a

1948 graduate from the University
of North Carolina. From his gradua-
tion until 1952, he was associated
with various North Carolina news-
papers. In that year he entered
training at Officer’s Candidate
School at Newport, Rhode Island
and became ensign, USNR. He serv-
ed for two years in Japan and was
discharged in 1954.

Washington Reporter
He returned to the Winston-Salem
Journal and in 1957 became Wash-
ington reporter. Later that year he
was awarded a Nieman Fellowship
to Harvard University.

In 1960 Mr. Wicker joined the
staff of The New York Times Wash-
ington Bureau and covered the
White House, Capitol and national
politics. In this capacity he covered
most of the events of the Kennedy
Administration, and he was riding in
the Presidential motorcade in Dallas
on November 22, 1963, when the
President was asssinated.

Kennedy Without Tears

He is the author of six novels,
the most recent being Kennedy
Without Tears. This book, sixty-one
pages in length, was first published
in Esquire Magazine. In his intro-
duction to the book, Arthur Krock
(of the Times) says, “...Tom Wicker
has rendered the service to contem-
porary and future history of striking
at a legend in the first phase of its
mounting evolution. The truth ex-
plains what the gathering myth ob-
scures—that Kennedy was endear-
ingly and admirably human.”

M. L. Kalb, writing in Book Week,
said of Kennedy Without Tears:

. Wieker’s is a perfect conclusion
to a tour through Kennedyana. It
is itself witty, well written, and
wise.

Clothes Do Not Reflect Individualism

While frantically scanning the bulletin board in front of
Payne Hall at 8:25 in search of the room number in which
Horticulture 208 met, a mimeographed sheet caught our eye.

By the time we returned to read it after class, someone had
placed an advertisement for a used Maserati 5000 GT (bright
red) over it. But, ever mindful of our duty to know all, see all,
and say nothing, we removed the ad. After reading the sheet
more carefully, we felt a better purpose would be served by
leaving the ad where it was.

“Down with tradition... tear off your rags of conform-
ity...,” or something like that. It was an old approach to an
old queston. Washington and Lee was compared to a huge
metropolis where insecure youngsters band together on street
corners to fight the hardships of the big city wearing the same
kind of leather jackets. Dramatic, isn’t it?

The wearing of a coat and tie was, as usual, the point of
this type of document. By now this should be a dead issue, but
some never-say-die, change for the sake of change advocates
feel all tradition must go.

What these freshmen (obviously) do not realize is that
becoming adjusted to one’s environment does not mean total
and weak-willed conformity.

One W&L professor asks, “Why can’t we have at least one
beatnik on campus?” We can, if that’s what we need; but it
seems that “at least one individualist (or a lot of them) would
be a bit more beneficial to campus life.

We fail, however, to see how wearing a tie or not wearing
a tie will, in any way, reinforce a person’s individualism.

 

Head of Student Library Committee
Describes Its Procedures, Purpose

Editor’s note: In order to inform
freshmen and upperclassmen on
the workings of their four student
committees, the Library Commit-
tee, Cold Check Committee, Stu-
dent Control Committee, and the
Assimilation Committee, we are
running a series of articles by the
respective committee heads. This
is the first article of that series.

Hidden among its associate organ-
izations (the Cold Check Commit-
tee, the Assimilation Committe and
the Student Control Committee) is
the Student Library Committee.
Students, in many instances, are

 

unaware of its existence or unfamil-
iar with its aims.

The Library Committee does not
consider its task to be chiefly a
disciplinary one. It doesn’t fulfill the
role of a student proctor or over-
seer. Primarily, the committee seeks
to promote better cooperation be-
tween the student body and McCor-
mick Library with its six depart-
mental branches. It strives to in-
sure the libraries’ facilitites are kept
free for general use, and that li-
brary privileges are not abused.

The Committee acts as a mediator
between the students and the li-

 

Liberty Hall Society Serves

As Informal Seminar Group

By STEVE MEIXNER

In the tradition of the campus tit-|
erary societies which were the cen-
ter of student life during the first
half of the nineteenth century, the
Liberty Hall Society was established
at Washington and Lee University. |
Founded in 1959 by Peter Lee, Tim|
Ireland, and Jon MeLin, the Society
is aimed at stimulating discussion on}
a wide range of topics between it’s!

 

If it takes an open collar to make a W&L man an individual-
ist, then either W&L men or individualism leaves a great to
be desired.

Toward A Better Grading System

Has it ever seemed unfair to you that two students, one
having an 81 average and the other an 89 average, receive the
same grade in a course and are credited with the same number
of quality points? Each receives a B in the three-hour course
and each is credited with six quality points, even though the
student having the 89 average has just missed getting the A
and the student having the 81 average has just escaped a C.

Our grading system is too general if it makes no distinction
between such differing averages. This system motivates the
student to shoot for the lowest possible B since there is no re-
ward for increased effort within the B range of grades. The
same holds true for the C, D, and F grade range.

We would like to propose for the consideration of the
self-study committee on grades a system of plus-es. A B*
would be worth 2.5 quality points, a C* would be worth 1.5
quality points, a D*—.5 and an F* would be negative .5. It
seems that this system would increase motivation and incorpor-
ate some of the advantages of number grading now lacking.

College Pressures Part One: The Student

 

Tragic Tale of Chaz Bimberg

as normal-looking as any other stu-
dent at Ampersand, except, per-

By TIM CROWLEY

Author's note: The following
case history was disclosed to me
by Dean Rodriguez of Ampersand
University. It concerns one Chaz
Bimberg, a student who enrolled
in the freshman class last Septem-
ber, suffered a complete mental
collapse one week later, and since
that time has been shut in the
locked Reserve Book Cage until
his parents arrived from Majorca
(Mallorca?) and make more suit-
able arrangements with the local
sanitarium. Dean Redrigues’ desire
that this stery be made public was
a direct result of the issue of Life
last month which discussed the
rising pressures on college stu-
dents at Eastern Universities. At
Ampersand (the Queen's college
of the South), the Dean found in-
dications of just such pressures
on his students and is now under-
taking a reorganization of policy
which will serve to prevent any
more freshmen from following in
the footsteps of the unfortunate
Bimberg. In the meantime, we at
Washingten and Lee can undoubt-
edly benefit from this transcript of

trative Committee at Ampersand

lem. What's that? Oh yes, of course.
Those are his eyes, that’s his nose,
and this undoubtedly is his mouth.
But as you can see he seems per-
fectly ordinary. The point I'm mak-
ing is that what happened to Chaz
could have happened to any of our
students

But let us get down to facts.
Until he arrived here last Septem-
ber, Chaz had spent his entire life
on the island of Maporca or Mal-
lorca with only an eccasional trip
to Balleny to break the monotony
of his existence. His father, a
prominent olive grower who inter-
married with a member of the
native population, never allowed
Chaz to drink, smoke, or associate
with any of his classmates at Mo-
jorea or Mallorea High, and it
seems that on Chaz’ tenth birth-
day Mr. Bimberg bought his son
a pet gibbon which has been his
sole childhood companion and
playmate. (Oddly enough, it was
the gibbon which served as an
additional setback te the boy's ad-
justment when, at the termination
of Rush Week, Chaz was forced

After that, he reads an editorial
from the school paper with which
he disagrees and tears into bits.
Then he dismisses class.

“After sitting through this lecture
five times in two days, Chaz was on
the verge of collapse, but what
really put him ‘over the hill,” so to
speak, was the incident in the Mick-
or-Mack library that evening. With-
out reading the library rules pamph-
let, Bimberg went there to check out
books he would need for a term
paper ,and strictly by chance all his
selections from the card catalogue
were on Locked Reserve. As is the
custom, the librarian remined him
that his books had to be returned by
nine o'clock the next morning and
that there was a fine of fifty cents a
minute if they were overdue. It was
then that Bimberg'’s mind cracked

To the Editor:

I am both shocked and saddened
learn that there a type of

is

to

believe your readers deserve to
learn something about the dastardly
activities of this insidious menace
to our society.

So far as I ean tell, the group
is mainly composed of freshmen, and

 

at the present time they are rela-
tively dormant in their activities.
However, given the proverbial rash-
ness of the freshman, there is no
telling what might happen.

This cell is so highly organized
that it even is headed by the usual
“Grand Lizard” at the top. This
despicable individual apparently is
the founder and motivating spirit
behind the whole plot.

The goals of this group are shad-
owy and dangerous. There is talk of
a revived Confederacy and a res-
toration to the “old days.” It all)
smacks of freshman daydreaming, to|
be sure; still the possibilities of|
their plans blossoming into some |
terrible fruition are frightening to |
consider.

If Washington and Lee is the type |
of school at which a KKK chapter |
can exist, it is a sad day for the}
“Lee” end of the University’s name.
Robert E. Lee would never have|
condoned the mysterious silly busi-|
ness and the cloak-and-dagger ter-|
rorism of any KKK group.

I hope your newspaper will carry |
out an expose of the KKK menace
on this campus. This freshman class
is getting out of hand. Some of them
probably voted for Goldwater.

Professor’s Salaries
In Rider’s System

By BRUCE W. RIDER

Now that the Great Machine (peo-
ple are such damned nuisances) has
spewed forth the various copies of
semester grades (white copy for the
student, green copy for the parents,
and purple copy for the draft board)
it might be wise for us of this fine
paper of news to explain to those
who may not be enlightened what all
those little grades really stand for.

Here at Washington and Lee, the
finest institution of higher learning
in Rockbridge County if not in the
entire Shenandoah Valley—here, I
say, at W&L, we have a neat system
of grading which is as follows: the
highest grade is an ‘A,’ given to sen-
iors majoring in the subject in which
the grade is given. The next grade,
‘B, is given to juniors under like
circumstances.

Should the student, foolish lad,
stray from his major subject to
another course, he is given a Hook,
or ‘C, since his name is not on
the Departmental List of Majors.
The next grade down is a ‘D,
which signifies that the student
has cut too many classes and has
thus incurred the wrath of the
professor, who does not get any
cuts and is jealous of those who
do. And an ‘F’ signifies that the
student is “not activating his max-
imum potential,’ as we say in
academic circles. There is also a
grade given in Physical Education,
a ‘P, but since this newspaper is
sent through the mails I am not
at liberty to say what this letter
represents.

3ut why, may ask (clever
reader you) should we have all this
fuss and bother about such a silly
matter Aren't we just
supposed to be Learning for Learn-
ing’s Sake and not to be concerned
over such a trivial thing as semester
A good question, clever
reader, a good question.

reports?

We have come upon an idea or
two (in part suggested by a friend)
which might help us arrive at a
happier situation concerning grades
in this intellectual Disneyland called
college.

Why not have the students grade
the professors? There is precedent
for something like this: during the
Middle Ages (roughly between
the Fall of the Roman Empire—in
color—and the New Deal) univer-
sities were established for the
benefit of (it's hard to believe) the
students, At the end of class the
students would plunk down his
little bag of coins on the pro-
fessor's desk in payment if, of
course, the lecture had been a
good one.

Instead of students being graded

iat the end of the semester by the
teachers, let's try it the other way
around. Each class would decide

upon a grade for the professor in
and all of the profes-
sor’s class grades would be averaged
together to get his grade point ratio.

‘Sermon From the ‘Mount? Starts False Rumor;

An article appeared in the Fancy |

&L Cagers Lose to Roanoke C., 71-61

Inability to Score Early in 2nd Half
Proves Fatal for Cold WGL Squad

By GUY UNANGST

Washington and Lee’s basketball team was like a morning
shower last night—hot and cold. Or hot and non-hot.

The Generals poured in shots for awhile—when they could
get the ball downcourt—then found the basket curiously hos-

tile. Things got curiouser and curiouser and they lost to Roa-
*

noke, 71-61.

In the first half W&L didn’t miss
for six and a half minutes, and this
had it even at the half. In the sec-
ond period, the Generals didn’t hit
for 9:15, and Roanoke had a 12-point
lead.

W&L showed the effects of the loss
of their No. 1 jumper, Jeff Twardy,
who fell on the academic rocks.
Roanoke outrebounded W&L, 51-31,
and 2-1 in the second half.

That told the story, since Roa-
noke was doing worse from the floor.
The Maroons hit only 28.6 per cent,
compared to W&L’s 32.8 per cent.

The Generals hit eight of their
first ten shots, and moved into a
29-21 lead three-quarters of the way
through the first half. Then they
stopped hitting and Roanoke pulled

ahead, 32-31. Five foul shots tied
the score.

Roanoke outscored W&L, 17-4
early in the second half, W&L

making only one of its first 17 shots.
The Generals came alive briefly,
pulling within nine points, but then
Butch Prillaman (eight points in the
last ten minutes) led Roanoke out
of trouble.

Prillaman got 13, John Mongero
17, but W&L's Dick Livingston was

the game’s high scorer. He had 22
points, nine on three-point plays.
Jody Kline added 11.

For a change, fouls weren't the big
problem. W&L collected only 18, a
season low. ..Bob Spessard fouled
out midway in the second half...
Kline and Larry Perrault started at
points (guards) last night... . One
good thing: North Carolina Wesleyan

The Washington and Lee fresh-

come a JV team instead. However,
several problems arose to make this
impossible.

W&L Weentlors
To Face N.C.
State, Duke

By TOM WHITE

Ready for action after a three-
week exam break, the Washington

and Lee wrestling squad goes after
its fifth and sixth wins of the season
in two home encounters this week-
end.

The Generals tonight will face
North Carolina State while tomor-
row night Duke will be in town.
Both matches will start at 8:30 p.m.
at Doremus Gym.

N.C. State last year defeated the
Generals by a 19-13 score. But coach
Dick Miller reports State is not too
strong this year. State was hard-hit
by graduations after last year’s sea-
son and, as a result, has only one
starter back from last year’s squad,
Brawlee at 167 pounds. He will face
Pete Winfield. One other tough
wrestler for State is Wayland whom
coach Miller described as “a good
heavyweight.”

State has met only one squad
W&L has already faced and that is
North Carolina. W&L downed N.C.
earlier this season and N.C. then
went on to defeat State.

Duke should provide the tougher
opposition for the General matmen.
They have already beaten N.C. State
and also have several veterans back
from last year’s team which lost
to W&L 21-13.

The Generals should find their
toughest competition from two Duke
wrestlers who defeated W&L men
last year. They are Holden at 147
who beat Jamie Andrew last year
and Lam at 167.

While refusing to predict the out-
come of the weekend’s competition
coach Miller did say, “If we are in
good condition after the layoff—and
I think we are—we should do all
right.” He cautioned, however, that
“Duke is always unpredictable.” No
General matmen were lost due to
academic trouble.

While the varsity wrestlers seek
