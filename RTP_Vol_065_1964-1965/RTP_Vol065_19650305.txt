The Language Requirement

In order to obtain a B.A. degree from Washington and
Lee, it is necessary to complete a third year course in one of the
modern languages. It is judged that on the completion of such
a course the student will have either the ability to speak or
read that language fluently He has a choice of which he wishes
to emphasize.

We do not deny that either of these achievements is a
valuable contribution to a liberal education. We would even
go so far as to say that they are essential for a complete edu-
cation. At the same time, however, we recognize that there are
other valuable components to a liberal education. Philosophy,
religion and economics are three of these, none of which
is included on the list of required courses. Of those that are
required, none take as many class hours to complete as does
the language requirement. Only six hours are required in sci-
ence and math and only twelve hours in history and Eng-
lish. The language requirement, on the other hand takes eigh-
teen hours for completion. Our first complaint is then, that
though the object of such a requirement is noble, the time
required for its completion is excessive.

Our second objection to the three year language require-
ment is that very few students who complete the 201-202
level have the ability to speak or read the language fluently.
In the first place the department finds it hard to demand such
competence from students who are forced to take the course,
and secondly, the majority of the students are reluctant to
do even the work that is required. Among the students who are
coerced into taking them, these courses are known as “hook
courses. That is, a course in which one only seeks to be average
and to get a C.

As a general rule, we spend our money where we will get
the most for it. The same should apply for our time. In order
to take three years of language at Washington and Lee, it costs
the student $340, figured on the basis of two dollars per class
hour. Most would prefer to spend this money on courses which
do require classroom instruction, and considering the nega-
tive attitude which hangs over Robinson Hall classrooms, they

would no doubt get more from it if spent elsewhere. The time.

spent on these courses is again poorly invested for many of
these students. For those who lack the motivation or aptitude
to master a foreign language, translations become busywork
of no greater value than a crossword puzzle. Why not allow
such students to spend their time and their money on a sub-
ject in which they are interested and take the load of such
deadweight off the professors in the language department?

We do not intend in this editorial to slight the dedicated
professors in modern languages. We wish only to point out
that the emphasis laid on this program is totally disproportion-
ate with rest of our program here. How can we rationalize
having three Spanish, five French, and four German profes-
sors, when we have only two in philosophy, and how can we re-
quire a student to take eighteen semester hours of a foreign
language when we only require twelve hours in English?

Traditional Eyesore

An old eyesore which has proved about as useful as Old
George atop Washington Hall and of far less symbolic value
has been too long in useless evidence on this campus.

Students have gotten too used to seeing the unwanted
structure.

Editorial after editorial has been written about it.

The administration has successfully managed to sidestep its
removal or conversion into a useful building.

If it’s not to be used, let’s remove it so that the walk from
the freshman quad to the library will be a few steps shorter.

If the administration wants to soothe its conscience con-
cerning the glaring lack of a real W&L Student Union, it might
be converted into a quasi-Student Union.

At any rate, something should be done. If it can’t be con-
verted, it should be removed. If it can’t be removed, it should
be converted. Perhaps if it’s lefe just as it is, we can add it
someday to the list of W&L traditions.

The Ring-tum Phi would like to ask the administration
just what its plans for the building are. Thus far no one really
seems to know. The Old Co-op has been too long with us. So
has the need for a Student Union that is a Student Union.

 

 

A Bureaucracy?

In proposing the election of freshman class officers, the
Executive Committee has, admittedly, lived up to one of the

candidates to the ‘big three.”

The question is, however, what need is there for these ad.
ditional officers—except, of course, to fill the pages of the
Calyx? What functions would they perform? How valid would
be their election since freshmen seldom really know their class-
mates before fall freshman elections? Of what use would be
their election?

As Others See Us

 

ALVORD BEARDSLEE
Hollins Chapel Chaplain

I have questioned the reputation
of your university and the value of
your fraternities. Kindly letters so
far have agreed some and been sorry
some that I have had unpleasant
encounters with men and houses
otherwise, sometimes, creative and
‘| fine. I have been too harsh, shrill,
“carried away.”

Now I move my challenge onto
far more dangerous grounds, Fra-
ternities, especially in conserva-
tive universities, are easy to at-
tack. Administrations are too, but
for different reasons. Many faculty
members and, I suppose, many stu-
dents see administration officials as
shadowy tyrants, manipulating the
fates of subjects and souls.

My criticism of your administra-
tion

Mad As Hell

Dr. Fred C. Cole, President
Washington and Lee University
Virginia

Dear Dr. Cole:

Over Fancy Dress weekend I re-
turned to the school for the first
time since graduating in 1961.

Arriving in town too late to
change, my date, Miss Robbie Rad-
cliff, and I went directly to the dance
at about 11:30 in suit and sportcoat
we had traveled in. Seeing no ticket
desk we walked in to see the pro-
ceedings and to find Robbie’s broth-
er, Bob, an undergraduate. A stu-
dent officer of the dance immediately
asked us to leave for having no
ticket and being informally dressed.

Considering that the band was
finished and many couples had left
or were leaving I should have ex-
pected him to allow us to stay and
offer to help us find Bob after we
had explained the situation, but no
such luck and I’m mad as hell about
it. I hardly need add that Miss Rad-
cliff whose father graduated from
W&L and whose brother is now a
student there had a poor first im-
pression of the school after hearing
its praises all her life.

Initially 1 was inclined not to

ters To The Editor . . .

 

blame the school for one student's
conduct but, having observed the
general neglect of the speaking |
tradition and of conventional dress |
the rest of the weekend, I am f
moved to write.

The hospitality of the student body |
to visitors on campus has been well}
known in the past and, aside from |
being worthwhile in itself, has re-|
sulted in generous gifts from total |
strangers. I believe Doremus Gym)
was one such gift. Thus if you!
didn't care to maintain the tradi-
tional values of the W&L gentleman}
for better reasons, it would be prac-|
tical to do so

Surely everyone who knows
WAL will agree that its traditions |
have contributed immeasurably to
the schools fine reputation and
have set it apart from other schools
of similar size and endowment, In |
addition I'm certain the atmos- |
phere created by the school’s tra-

ically slow too. But you do have
the great spirit of General Lee, as
The University has the (embalmed)
spirit of Mr. Jefferson, to combat
Governor Berkley, Baron of Bote-
tourt. Berkerley prayed that educa-
tion and its cohort sedition, not come
to his Colony. I galute all efforts to
frustrate his prayer.

Fraternities and student leaders
ask for and receive enormous res-
ponsibility, My impression is that
more is granted in this state than
elsewhere. This does not mean that
Virginia school rules are less strict,
but that the cavalier tradition is
a cavalier flaunting of the rules.

Two items. My first introduction
to Washington and Lee was in a file
I inherited. It had an article on a
faculty meeting in Lexington which

in the shortest time, and drank it.
(Don't try to defend yourselves,
boys, if you don’t want us to get
drunk, why do insist on serving us
that rotgut?)

Now we come to the resaon why

she drank it. Obviously because
either she didn’t know better, be-
cause she was thirsty and wasn’t of-
fered anything else to drink, or be-
cause she was so disgusted at what
was going on around her that she
had to drink it to ease the pain of
the company.

I have never understood why
you think this is fun for a date—

(if I may share my private |

nearly reprimanded the Dean for a
remarkably generous allowance of
student public misbehaviour. The
Proctor was apparently appointed as
a result. Second, the history of ‘the
University by your sometime pro-
fessor, Marshall Fishwick, shows the
long tradition of social laissez faire.

The King who could do no wrong
is replaced by a boy courtier who
cannot be reprimanded or removed.
One such, carried yelling back onto
his school bus, uttered the aristo-
cratic cry at our night watchman,
“You can’t touch me.”

In the increasingly popular private
ethic, represented in The Southern
Conservative, fraternity brothers
show little responsibility for a broth-
er’s action, and lie to protect his
freedom.

One major reason why I have
pursued only a few of the viola-
tions I have seen here, is my im-
pression that the boy reported to
the righteous authorities is separ-
ated from the offended community,
but the fraternity or other system
which led him into trouble, is not
touched, Similarly, womanhood, as
reported in your February 19 edi-
torial, is protected, while the wo-
man herself may end in the gutter,

The privatist ethic, so appealing to
the cavalier, does not include anal-
ysis of the ground of disorder or the
influence of a dying system. It takes
a delight in being wrong, perverse
pride in bad reputation.

Let the University honour new
ways of forwarding ancient goals, Let
it find its corporations of academic
desuetude and social indulgence
without discernable purpose or con-
tribution, and close them, to the
health of their former inhabitants
and to the renewed honour of a
greatly -founded school.

 

 

I have yet to meet a girl who can
truly say that she had a good time
at one of your orgies. We get ac-
customed to them but never en-
joy them. Perhaps if boys didn’t
start hitting the bottle at 2 p.m.,
if they didn’t take such delight
in “grain parties” and the like,
and if they themselves weren't so
preoccupied with getting stoned,
they might find that their dates
would stay sober too.

I regret that you are so upset
that we are not punished for our
“misbehavior.” Frankly, I have never
noticed that you all were particu-
larly overburdened with punish-
ments. The fact is that girls, drunk
though they may be, are far more
discrete in their behavior.

|idea of freshman officers. Most felt
there wasn’t any need for officers
and wondered what they would do.
Richard Nash, freshman E.C. repre-
sentative, who introduced the mea-
sure, argued strongly for its adop-
tion. Nash said that freshman officers
would greatly aid in more quickly
and smoothly assimilating the fresh-
man class into the University’s tra-
ditions and student body. He added
that,as a result the Freshman Class
would be more unified and could
take a more active part in helping
to set up such University functions
as dance sets and assemblies. This
proposal was one of the planks in
Student Body President Jim Kulp's
platform last spring, but was re-
jected by the E.C. earlier this year.

The so called Law School amend-
ment met with almost unanimous
approval. The consensus indicates
that the undergraduate body wants
a break with the Law School. Many
upperclassmen also feel that the law
students don’t particularly care to
be closely associated with the un-

Trackmen Beat Roanoke;

Meadors Stars for Generals

By TOM WHITE

Winning nine of 14 events, Wash-
ington and Lee’s winter track team
won its first dual meet of the season
in two starts last night as the Gen-
eral trackmen downed Roanoke by
a 42-point margin, 80-38.

In another meet last night, W&L
freshmen finished third in a triangu-
lar meet with Bridgewater and Fork
Union, Bridgewater came in first
with 59 points to 49 for Fork Union
and 18 for W&L.

Highlighting the W&L team effort
was the performance of freshman
Luke Meadors who picked up two
firsts winning the broad jump and
the triple jump. Meadors’ winning
effort in the broad jump was 19 feet
842 inches. In the triple jump his
total was 39 feet one inch.

The Generals also took two of
three other field events in last night's
meet. Winning the shot put was Tom
Sparks with a distance of 38 feet
three inches. W&L swept the top
three places in the event with Ben-
edict coming in second and Bob
Skinner third.

Rick Rogers added a victory for
W&L in the pole vault, another
event the Generals swept. Rogers
had a jump of ten feet six inches.
Johnny Graham was second, Clai-
borne Darden third.

The one General loss in field
events was in the high jump where
Clarke of Roanoke took first with a
jump of five feet four and three-
quarters inches. Caldwell of Roanoke
took second while Graham topped
General finishers in third.

Two team events were split. W&L
won the 440 relay with a time of
:47.2. Roanoke took the win in the
mile relay with a winning time of
3:37.7.

dergraduate students. As one junior
pointed out, “the law students don’t
like to have so many ties with un-
dergraduate school. They feel that
they are in graduate school now and
that a sharper distinction should ex-
ist between the two schools.” As
yet another student put it, “the
amendment is a step in the right di-
rection, still it’s a compromise which
falls far short of what should be
done, namely, that law students
shouldn’t be permitted to run for any
of the big three positions.” Finally
a seinor expressed the commonly
held view that law students strive
to be different anyway, so why try
to unite ourselves with them.

So the winds of change are blow-
ing strongly over the campus. As
the student body thinks in different
channels today, a new concept of its
mutual relations evolves. The ques-
tion is no longer whether the struc-
ture of the EC will be altered come
Spring, but how marked a change
does the near future hold.
