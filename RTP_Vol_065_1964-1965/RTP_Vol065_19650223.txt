Hones System

Changes Asked
By Rick Carrell

Senior EC Representative
Seeks Modified Penalty;
Turner Opposes Change

By MIKE HASH

The Honor System was the
subject of an extensive exam-
ination and reappraisal by the
Executive Committee last eve-
ning. Rick Carrell, senior class
representative to the EC, questioned
the “moral justification” of irrevoc-
able expulsion as a punishment for
honor violations, and asked for a
modification “based on a realistic
approach.”

Carrell Proposes Change
Carrell based his position on the
following three points. “First, we
must recognize that graduations in

honor offenses do exist and must be!

prepared to treat them as such. Sec-
ond, it is unfair both to the student
and to ourselves to permanently ex-
pell a student from our society as
irrevocably dishonest and immoral.
The present system does not allow
the students the right of forgiveness
or the right to redeem himself within
our society.”

“Finally, we must believe in the
two-fold purpose of the University.
The University must guide the stu-
dent's intellectual development and
also guide the student's social and
moral development. Irrevocable ex-
pulsion fails to recognize the social
purpose of the University and denies
this responsibility.”

“Forgiveness” Lacking

In addition Carrell stated that a
one-year suspension would be sufli-
ciently harsh to discourage cheating.
“It would admit forgiveness into the
W&L morality code and allow the
offender to retain his human worth
instead of being branded as a total-
ly dishonorable object.”

In answer to this position Jere
Turner, intermediate law represen-
tative, called for a careful approach
in dealing with the Honor System.
Much of Turner's remarks were
based on a survey conducted by
Columbia University on Student Dis-
honesty and Its Control in College.

Quoting from the survey Turner
said, “One obvious fact is that the
leniency with which academic dis-
honesty is treated on many campuses
may account, at least in part, for
its seriousness student dis-
ciplinary problem.”

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Tuesday Edition

A Clean, Efficient System

Last week’s Tuesday editorial criticized campus poli-
tics at Washington and Lee. This week the Ring-tum Phi
presents a plan for reform in campus politics—not under
the illusion that the plan below is the only answer to the
problem, but under the conviction that it is a good plan,
certainly with the knowledge that there is little to be lost
by changing the present situation.

Nine fraternities on this campus have no connection
with a political party. Some of these houses are remaining
independent in hope that a change in the political situation
will eventually enable them to join a strong party. But
others of the independent houses, apparently feeling
that parties are an evil in themselves, idealistically have
said that they will not join any party. These houses would
do much better for themselves and for student government
if, rather than condemning party politics altogether, they
sought to take part in forming a new party system which
would function efficiently and cleanly. Only in a recogni-
tion that parties are inevitable will our political situation
at Washington and Lee be permanently improved.

Our campus political situation demands a change, and
it must be one which embraces the party system—but
controls it. Such a change would be best initiated by the
Executive Committee, with which the primary responsi-
bility for student government rests. An improved system,
if proposed by the Executive Committee, would require
a majority vote of the student body to be incorporated
into the constitution; any change proposed by petition of
the student body would require a two-thirds student ap-
proval.

 

Creation of Elections Committee

A clean and efficient party system might be created
by starting with the division by the Executive Committee
of the eighteen fraternities into two parties as nearly equal
as possible. If the parties were numerically equal—and
this could be ensured by periodic rearrangements of the
parties by the E.C. if necessary—there would be a certain
pressure on both sides to nominate good candidates rather
than paying political debts.

The best way for the parties to nominate would be
through primaries held one or two weeks before general
elections. A good primary system could be set up with
students being eligible to vote in the primary of the party
in which they were members. Non-fraternity and law stu-
dents would be eligible to register with the party of their
choice and vote in that party’s primary.

The most important question to be answered in estab-
lishing a primary system is this: how to make sure that
a free choice of candidates is made available for each party
in the primary voting. The best method of nominating for
the primary would be simply to allow open nominations
from the floor at the same meeting held for the voting.
This would encourage individuals to nominate themselves
or the men they think would be effective officers. At the
same time, it would not rule out pre-primary campaigning
by students who desired to campaign on their own for
the nomination.

Equal Division of the Fraternities

To oversee this process the Executive Committee
could appoint an Elections Committee consisting, perhaps,
of several E.C. seniors plus the chairmen of both par-
ties. This committee could prevent any Clique backing
of a particular candidate prior to his nomination by the
primary; in other words, it would prevent fixed primaries.

The Elections Committee would meet before and
after the primary conventions, and the chairmen of both
parties would testify to the remainder of the committee
that their party Cliques had not met to rig the primaries;
thus free primaries would be certain, An elections Com-
mittee could also act as a “fair practices’ committee dur-
ing election campaigning.

A last measure to keep the old Cliques from controll-
ing the primaries would be open election of party chair-
men in the primaries themselves. There would, no doubr,
still be a Clique, a small group of behind-the-scenes poli-
ticians, but its function would no longer be to nominate
candidates, it would run the campaigns of the men nomi-
nated by the party primaries. This is the area where a
Clique is valuable—in creating an intense campaign in
which issues are debated before the student body. Election
of a Clique chairman by popular vote should change the
Clique from a semi-mysterious nominating body to such a
campaign machine; other Clique members would be elect-
ed representatives of each fraternity or perhaps the presi-
dents of the fraternities.

The Ring-tum Phi proposes this plan in the hope that
the E.C. will consider it and, if the plan is not adopted, at
least take some steps toward reform in student govern-
ment elections. The plan is also proposed with the hope
that the student body will take an interest in campus poli-
tics, stop leaving things to the Cliques, and put pressure
on the E.C. to correct or at least improve the present sit-
uation. In this edition of the newspaper the plan is pre-
sented sketchily, without much argument for its virtues;
next week, if the critics of the plan make themselves
known, there will be debate on its features.

Ring-tum Phi Columnist Kidnaps
‘The Phantom’ Of The Colonnade

Tuesday Columnist

It was three am. I crouched,
waiting in the darkness behind one
of the columns. Tonight was the
night—the night I would catch him
in the act.

All that knew about him was that
he lived in post office box 122, Not
much to go on. There was only one
way to catch the Phantom Writer,
and that was by beating him at his

own game of nighttime hide and
seek.
Somehow I felt sure he would

come. It would be a dangerous, per-
haps even deadly encounter. I was
stiff from cold, my fingers numb,
and yet I had every reason to be-
lieve that my opponent would be
warm (if not overheated), and that

his fingers would be quick and
strong from weeks of relentless
thumbtacking.

Footsteps. Someone approaching

and smiled, but he just walked on

 

Challenges Idea of ‘Absolute Honor’

 

2

(The article below, prompted by
current criticism of Honer Systems

since the Air Force Academy
seandal, is one of a pair of articles
re-evaluating the Washington and
Lee Honor System. The answering
article will be printed next week).

By LIN HARTIN

During the past few weeks, the
Air Force Academy has had over one
hundred cadets to “resign” following
the exposure of a rather large cheat-
ing seandal. It seems that a cadet
obtained a copy of examination
questions and with the help of sev-
eral cadets proceeded to sell the
questions to various members of the
corp. The operation was exposed by
two freshmen who felt obliged to re-
port the matter.

The Air Foree Academy has an
honor code very similar to ours here
at Washington and Lee. The cadets

pledge that they “will not lie, cheat,
or steal, or tolerate anyone among
us who does.” As is the case here,
the cadets are honor bound to re-
port any infractions of the code.
The current problem at the Air
Force Academy should arouse sym-
pathy here at Washington and Lee
Contrary to the opinion of one alum-
nus expressed in a letter printed in
this newpaper recently this is by no
means an occasion for Washington
and Lee to pat itself on the back.
We need only recall what we have
been told of the 1953 incident here
to realize that Washington and Lee
was at one time faced with a prob-
lem very similar to that confronting
the Air Force Academy today. It is
not necessary to go into the unpleas-
ant details of this incident, which
really aren't available anyway. It is
sufficient to say that Washington
and Lee and the Air Foree Academy

suffered a major break-down in their
honor systems.

When one tries to determine why
these breakdowns occured, one must
first face (at Washington and Lee
anyway) certain widely held notions
of “absolute honor.” By absolute
honor I refer to the belief that the
people who make up the student
body of this university (or what-
ever the group in consideration may
be) held identical views of what is
honorable and dishonorable and that,
as a former student body president
put it, one eannot have a little bit
of honor. He must personally sub-
scribe to entire “honor code” or not
be honorable at all.

I challenge this notion completely.
It is best, I think, to consider one’s
obligation under the honor system
as an agreement. When we entered
this university, we all agreed that,

In Ring-tum Phi Poll of Student Body

By STEVE SAUNDERS

Associate Editor
Exposed armpits and naked navels
are the source of genuine concern
here as revealed by the results of
another Ring-tum Phi poll. This
newest sampling of public opinion
was prompted by the negative re-
action reported from some quarters
regarding the assortment of navels
presented in the Fancy Dress issue

of the Southern Collegian.
Of those questioned, 50 per cent
said that they were not in the least
offended by bare navels; 20 per cent

said that they were mildly offended;

10 per cent said that they were
startled: 5 per cent were thoroughly
repulsed; 4 per cent suid they be-

eame violently ill; 2 per eent giggled
and flew off before answering. The

conclusion is obvious. In the future
we just have to keep Collegians
away from those 2 per cent-ers.

A late-night anonymous phone
eall from a man speaking with an
ebviously phony Northern nasal
twang indicated that some dates
might have been offended by the raw
display of carnalism in the Seuthern
Collegian. Seventy-one cent
noted that their dates were offended
in a “pleasant sort of way”; 10 per
eent said that their dates became
hysterical; 9 per cent said that their
dates liked the picture: 4 per cent
said that their dates were in no
eondition to see anything, much less
read the Seuthern Collegian; 4 pe:

Office.

The naked armpits which are such
a favorite of sports photographers
have alse come in for criticism. An
unsigned letter postmarked “Hollins,
Va.,” alerted us to the extent of this
criticism. This too was included in
our poll. We asked all these partici-
pating, “De you have anything
against armpits?” The replies ran as
follows. Sixty-three per cent said
“No”; 20 per cent said No, but even
your best friends won't tell you; 10
per cent confessed to having armpits
themselves and therefore asked to
be excused on grounds of bias: 5
per cent said they were opposed to
the publie exhibition of underarms,
and that, Yes, they were Protestant

by me, his eyes alertly forward, and
melted back into the darkness.

What I saw next, you may not be-
lieve: a rope slowly being let out
from the third floor of Payne Hall—-
a shadowy figure sliding down. The
Phantom! I froze as he drew near
the ODK board, unfolded a slip of
paper, and began thumbtacking with
gusto. It was time to spring the
trap.

I crept silently up behind him, po-
tato sack in hand, and with a_ tri-
umphant yell threw the empty bag
over his head. A brief struggle en-
sued, but I had the advantage of
superior strength and eunning and
soon was on the way back to my

apartment with an __ ineffectually
struggling Phantom Writer slung

“Boy! you sure are gnarfy and

He looked up at me, his close-set
little eyes burning red with the
hatred of a cornered rattlesnake.
“Why did you bring me here?” he
hissed, slithering the rest of the way
out of the bag and coliing up against
a couch.

I dangled one of his letters in front

at the last second, and the Phantom
went sprawling onto the carpet. I
began to read from the letter:

While I was reading, the Phantom

suddenly he became very agitated
and began swaying from side to side,

glowing. “I know who you are! he

I sensed that he was about to

Fraternity All-Stars Paste
Frolicking Faculty, 38 to 31

It was smacks of Dom Flora at
Doremus Gymnasium last night as
the Intramural All Stars drubbed
the fancy but arthritic Faculty
Stars, 38-31. The event, bolstered by
promise of a PE cut to those who
shelled out the rubles to attend, was
a huge success.

Actually the primary intention was
to raise money for a new football
scoreboard, and while there will be
no Bill Veecks jobs with sirens and
fireworks on Wilson Field next fall,
we may expect a reasonable fac-
simile for the posting of future
bizarre General scores.

In last night’s encounter, Nimble
Norris Eastman ascended from the
mucky waters of the Doremus pool
to delight the throng with his fancy
moves and his quick tongue. To
complement the floor work of
Eastman were the steady hip shots
of Dean Atwood, who also captain-
ed the losing effort. Providing
board strength were Lyles and
Hannum, but indeed there was a
very real dearth of Faculty re-
bounds last night.

 

The Intramural All Stars were

 

By TOM CARPENTER

The Washington and Lee basket- |
ball team finished its season Friday |
in typical style, losing to Centre,|
105-81, in the first round of the)
CAC Tournament. This amounts to|
a fifth place finish in a five-team)
league. It was a happy affair for|
most of the Generals in that one of |
the worst seasons in W&L history)
has now come to a close. I imagine
most of them feel that next year is
certain to be somewhat more enjoy-|
able than this year was.

Verne Canfield is also probably
relieved to see this season come to
an end. For Canfield this was a new
experience, being head man of a
losing, to say the least, basketball
team. Now that he is over the hump,
having survived his first season as|
coach here, a feat that deserves rec-
ognition, he can look forward to
bigger and better things in the years
to «ome, and it appears that he will
be here for some time unless he
himself decides to move on because
of a better offer or the like. Don’t
take this vote of confidence,
Coach, because I don’t want to give
you the kiss of death.

The Centre defeat Friday left the
Generals with a final reeord of 2
victories and 17 losing efforts. One
of the two victories, the one over
Old Domniion, was an upset, while
the victory over North

a5 a

leyan proved that there was

paced by Bob Lohman, who con-
tinually broke into the clear for
valuable lay-ups; George Madison,
who brought down the bulk of both
offensive and defensive rebounds;
and Skip Chase, who managed to
weather the abuse heaped upon
him by Coach Eastman during the
entire contest. Indeed Skip poured
salt in his own wounds by inadvert-
ently attempting to stuff the nets
of the enemy, but to his dismay
the shot went awry.

After the initial stanza of the
battle, the faculty found them-
selves in their best position of the
evening, tied at 4-4. The IM
cagers then went to work to take
a 15-9 at the half—a lead ex-
tended to 28-19 at the end of three
periods. The hustling veterans then
closed the gap with a last minute
surge, but it was too late...

Of course the struggle was proc-
tored by Coach Lord, in good voice
and high spirits, who livened up the
activities. In addition to his antics,
the crowd was treated to the com-
ments of Doctor Shillington, in trib-|
al garb for the annual event. In-|
deed all were in a gay mood.

 

Generals, and even Wesleyan had
won one game.

The 105 points by Centre typified
the Generals’ defensive play all sea-
son, although one of the players
commented that Centre’s passing was
vastly improved over what they
showed in the previous game with
the Generals this season. All year
the Blue and White were suscep-
tible to the fast break, as was dem-
onstrated by RPI here last Tuesday.
Canfield’s boys seem to lack overall
speed. Before the Generals can have
a winning team they are going to
have to learn how to play defense.

The offense, on the other hand, was
hot and cold, usually cold. The out-

| Side shooting was generally deficient
jand the inside shooting was only

as good as Dick Livnigston on any
given night. Fortunately for Can-
field Livingston is the only important
loss from this year’s club, assuming

| that Jeff Twardy will be eligible to

play next season. The team could
get a big lift if Lou Paterno goes
to law school here next year. Pater-
no, who has one more year of eligi-
bility remaining, has proven in pre-
vious seasons that he can provide
the much needed outside shooting

threat. With Twardy, who could de-
velop into another Roger Fauber,
and Lou Paterno next year the

|Generals could provide the home-
Carolina |
Wesleyan was to be expected. Wes-|

town fans some really interesting
basketball. Without them it seems
safe to say that Canfield will be in
for another long season.

W&L Freshman Wins Triple Jump In State Meet;

Switrerland — The International Travel Establishment will locate job
opportunities in Europe for anyone who likes the idea of a fun-filled,
low cost trip to Europe. Jobs are available in all fields throughout

gue. Sewanee still managed to give
eage titan Tennessee and Georgia
Tech stiff battles in their meetings
early in the season.

Actually Tech gave Sewanee a
rather sound beating, but the Vols
escaped with a twelve point vic-
tory. This is quite interesting in
light of the fact that Tennessee,
before their upset loss te Alabama
on Saturday, was ranked eighth in
the nation and was top dog in the
rugged SEC.

Musick, Winfield,
White Victorious In
Win by Monarchs

By BOB MAY
Tuesday Sports Writer

The Washington and Lee varsity
wrestlers were handed a 17-11 beat-
ing on Saturday by highly-regarded
Old Dominion College. The contest
played at Norfolk left the General
grapplers with three setbacks
compared to seven victories.

In the lid-lifter tri-captain Butch
West ended up on the short end of
a 9-3 tally. At 130, however, Dick
Musick evened the match for the
W&L grapplers with a 10-2 trounc-
ing of Robert Hall, bringing his
team-leading record to 9-1. Kimble
White, in the 137-pound class, man-
aged the only pin of the day for
the Generals. Down 5-0, White re-
versed his opponent to record his

as

sixth win of the season after 33
seconds of the third period.
Tri-captain Tom Stover at 147

lost a wild match to Irwin Williams
by a 10-7 count. Paul Cote kept
Q.D. rolling with an 8-1 victory over
Jamie Andrew. Tri-captain Peter
Winfield at 167 kept the Generals in
contention as he edged the Monarch
captain Richard Harris 4-3. How-
ever, in the 177 division Warren
Stewart was whitewashed in a close
one, 2-0.

In the heavyweight class the Gen-
erals were further frustrated as
John Bogart was pinned by the op-
ponents Jeff Hall at 6:33 of the en-
counter.

The W&L grapplers finish out
their season Saturday night wiht a
home match against a tough Virginia
team.

ing away an old leaf, offering tem-
porary salvation. He is a father to
making love in a church. The irony
is astringent. God’s role mingles
imperceptibly with the Father’s, This
is made explicit in one of the film’s
key scenes when Ester confronts
Anna in her bed with a foreign
lover. “I hate you because you make
everything so important!” Anna
cries, “I’m fed up with your princi-
ples. When father died you didn’t
want to go on living. Why are you
living still?” Ester continues the
moral judgment inherited from her
father. Anna has rejected it and fol-
lows only the desires of her strong,
healthy body.

But Father is dead, as Ester re-
calls on what she thinks is her
death-bed. She makes what she con-
siders her “confession before divine
unction.” Placing her hand on the
valet’s head, she is overcome by
her fear and hate of sex, of “male
glands” and “horrible forces,” she
wipes the sweat off her chest and
lips and cries out her anguish, the
division of nature.

Then, in one of the film’s most
humbling moments, Bergman shows
us fear on the threshhold of death.
A sound like departing ship’s sirens
looms loudly and Ester gasps in a
panic of suffocation. Terrified, she
finally draws the sheet over her
head, as if to get rid of it once
and for all, to make a true winding
sheet at last. It is a naive and tre-
mendous gesture, witnessed silently
by the old valet, who has just been
identified as the owner of the watch
whose ticking has been present at
the beginning of the film and at all
the turning points, and is the only
noise without a naturalistic basis.

It is difficult not to believe that
on this deeper, more imaginative
level, the old man is not meant to
stand in the place of God—a slightly
absurd, fragil and temporary next-
best.

The meaning of several other im-
ages are beautiful and emerge only
if we forget the hullabaloo raised
about the supposed obscenity of the
movie, and attend to the articulations

agreement. One’s personal honor is

|quite a different thing. This honor

is a product of environment and up-
bringing and may or may not con-
sider the same things honorable or
dishonorable that Washington and
Lee as an institution does.

A former executive committeeman
once told me that when a student
is found guilty of an honor violation,
the university as a whole is simply
admitting an error in the admission
process. This is to say that a stu-
dent who was not “honorable” was
admitted to the university by mis-
take. This is sheer sophistry. How
could the office of admissions look
into the heart of the individual and
know his personal value? We simply
make an agreement and do our best
to live up to it.

To illustrate this point more clear-

ly, I must admit that I do not know;

positively that I will never lie, cheat,
or steal. Would I be strong enough
to not lie, cheat, or steal under great
emotional strain? For all I know I
might not. I do not know that I
could report an honor violation on
the part of a very close friend.

new 2-year

Army ROTC program means 10 you

A new Reserve Officer Training Corps program permits selected
college sophomores to be commissioned as Army Second Lieuten-
ants in two years. You can do this by:

1. Completing a special 6-week summer camp between your soph-

omore and junior years.

2. Completing the 2-year Advanced Course at any school offering

the ROTC program.

What are the benefits of Army ROTC training?

Management training for success in civilian or military life.

$40 per month pay while attend

ing the Advanced Course, plus

uniforms; pay and paid travel for summer camps.

Eligibility for free flight instruction at selected schools lead-

ing to a private pilot’s license.

A commission as an Army officer, with all of its accompanying
benefits, including higher income, greater opportunity for ad-

vancement and officer status.

The personal satisfaction that comes from knowing you're
trained to assume leadership responsibilities.

These benefits will put you a step ahead of other college graduates
and will pay off for the rest of your life. You owe it to yourself to
investigate these new opportunities.

| This brings into view what Mr.
| Eric Sevareid, in a recent issue of
|The New Republic, was quoted as
‘ealling “the choice between an in-
| stitutional conscience and one’s na-
utral conscience.” It is easy to see
that under pressure a conflict might
arise here and a breakdown similar
to the two under consideration re-
sult from this frustration,

The New Republic goes on to point
out that “American ethos has held
in ill repute the man who tells on a
friend....That puts a very severe
strain on an honor system.”

If we accept this explanation, we
must ask what can be done to pre-
vent any such problem in the future.
There is no clear cut answer. We
must all continuously analyze and
re-evaluate our own system with
the view of reducing these conflicts
as much as possbile. In this respon-
sibility, however, we at Washington
and Lee fail tragically.
