E.C. Considers Proposal

To Set Mock

By MIKE HASH
Assistant Editor

Last night the Executive Commit-
tee held its regular weekly meeting
in order to consider several perti-
nent proposals concerning the pos-
sibility of a mock honor trial, the
selection of an interim coordinator
of the Mock Convention and the ref-
erendum dealing with the Assimila-
tion Committee.

Changing its weekly meeting to
Monday night, the Executive Com-
mittee plans to continue its policy
of open meetings with the necessary
prerogative of executive session in
confidential matters. In addition
members of the student body are free
to express their opinions on issues
under consideration by the EC either
in writing or in person.

Mock Honor Trial

A sub-committee of the EC sub-
mitted a proposal to serve as a basis
for a possible mock honor trial. The
recommendation in par suggested
that a tape of an honor trial some
8 to 10 years ago be transcribed
omitting the names of those involv-
ed and given to certain members of
the Law School faculty so that
the transcription might be edited
to include dramatic effect.

The mock trial if held would per-
haps be a mandatory assembly for
freshmen and first year law stu-
dents. The most appropriate setting

 

for the trial which would be pro-

Honor Trial

duced by members of the EC is Lee
Chapel.

Convention Interim
Final selections of a Mock Con-
vention Interim Coordinator was de-
layed pending interviews of seven
prospective applicants. The EC did
decide to select one sophomore and
one freshman to serve as dual co-
ordinators of the 1968 Mock Con-
vention. The seven applicants are;
sophomores Dave Mayfield, Frank
Fairchild, Howard Epstein; fresh-
men, Rod Boren, Steve Saunders,

Bill Stone and Webb DeHoff.

The petition for a referendum on
the question of conventional dress
and on the existence of the Assimila-
tion Committee was passed on to
Brooks Brown, chairman of the com-

mittee, so that a suitable draft of|

the referendum might be presented
to the student body as soon as pos-
sible.

Dress Clarification

In essence the bill will request a
clarification of what is considered
conventional dress and a vote of
confidence for the continuation of
the Assimilation Committee. The
referendum will not have the force
of a constitutional amendment which
requires a two-thirds majority of
the student body. Its primary pur-

pose is to reflect the present con-|

sensus of the students in order to
serve as a basis for maintaining the
tradition of conventional dress.

a cello which are skillfully combin-
ed to form “the oneness requisite
for a satisfying performance.”

The concert the third in a
series being presented by the Con-
cert Guild this year. Past perfor-
mances have proven quite success-
ful and a repeat of the full house

The concluding part of this year’s
Glasgow Endowment Series was pre- |
sented Friday evening, Nov. 6, in du-
| Pont Auditorium. The program in-|
| cluded a reading of portions from
| the poem “Brother To Dragons: A
Tale in Verse and Voices” by Pulit-
zer Prize Winner Robert Penn War-
ren, and a subsequent discussion of
the poem led by the author.
The reading and discussion cli-

IFC Discusses —
VMI Censorship

By DAVE MARCHESE

Last night, the IFC met in the Stu-
dent Union. After the roll call and the
reading of last week's minutes reports
were made by the various standing
committees. Foreign student chairman
| Harry Dennery and Contact Chair-
|man Blaine Brownell reported that
their committees were progressing to
the satisfaction of all.

Further progress has been made in
} an attempt to straighten out the prev-
iously confusing bus transportation

 

fin, assigned to the task, reported that
| Pete’s Taxi and Bus Co., was planning
to take over the franchise. The stu-
dents aare reminded that unless
enough of them purchase their date’s
bus ticket at the Co-op before Fri-
day, the buses would not be able to
run. And if they don’t run the tickets
will be refunded. The LF.C. strongly
recommends this useful service. They
have worked hard to establish it and
feel that everyone concernd will bene-
fit.

Under new business, the Rat Pack
will be back on campus, on an invi-
tation basis only. This refers to the
returned presence of VMI Cadets at
W&L social functions. Again, on an
invitation basis only

A startling situation was brought to

light at last night's meeting. Dean At-
wood announced that twelve of our
eighteen fraternities have failed to

wesent financial reports dating as far
back as January, 1964, despite contin-
ual promises to do so. He informed the
representatives that those fraternitie

Friday night’s program began
with a reading of the poem

the work is of book-length, War-

a dialogue and not a play. Out of

was abridged into three chrono-
logical sections respectively titled:

Four In Reading of Warren Play

their dead mother. The verse plot
deals with the fate of the two
brothers, as discussed by them af-
ter their death.

Reviewing the actual plot of the
poem, Mr. Warren stated: “The main
body of the action is in the remote
past—in the earthly past of the
characters long dead—and now they
meet at an unspecified place and at
an unspecified time to try to make
sense of that action. We may take
them to appear, and disappear, as
their inner urgencies, and the ur-
| gencies of argument, swell and sub-
| side. The issue that the characters

 

man constant.”
| Mrs, G. W. Ray, compassionately
| interpreted the part of Lucy Lewis,

the sister of Thomas Jefferson.
The role of Thomas Jefferson was
portrayed by Mr. John Evans, a
new member of the W&L English
Department. In a very finished
reading Mr. James Boatwright as-
sumed the contrasting roles of the
two sons, Isham and Lilburn, and
Meriwether Lewis, a cousin of Jef-
ferson. Finally Dr. Cecil Jones
rendered the part of RPW, a fic-
tional representation of the author.

In the discussion which followed
the reading, Mr. Warren compli-
menting the editing of the poem,
initially stated: “I was struck by
the critical astuteness with which
| the abridging was done, by the elo-
quence of the presentation, and by
the great sympathetic attempt to
bring to life some of my limping
lines.” Responding to a question
posed by President Fred Cole, Mr.
Warren commented on the back-
ground of the poem

Phi Kap Entry

Isabel Loperena

Crowned Queen
By KIP ARMSTRONG

Homecoming last weekend
was highlighted by the greatest
outburst of spirit at Washing-
ton and Lee in recent years,
and the largest crowd of the

season saw the Generals re-
spond with a complete upset vic-
tory over previously unbeaten Se-
wanee.

Miss Maria Isabel Loperena, rep-
resenting Phi Kap, was crowned
Homecoming Queen at halftime of
the game, and it was announced
that Sigma Phi Epsilon’s “Roll the
Tigers” theme had won the fraterni-
ty display contest.

Torchlight Parade
The activities began with a torch-
light parade on Friday night. The
turn-out for this event, a restora-
tion of the freshman pajama parade,
was the first real display of spirit

*shown by the student body this

year. The parade was followed by a
Pep Rally in the gym conducted
by M.C. Randy Jones and loyal Sem
cheerleaders. It was evident at the
rally that this could be no ordinary
weekend.

The Homecoming representatives
were introduced and received a great
reception, especially the last five
lovelies, representing such renown-
ed female institutions as Briarcliff,
Pine Manor, Limestone, and our own
Southern Seminary. Cheers for the
team followed, and the crowd’s re-
sponse to Co-captains Crenshaw’s
speech indicated the hopes of all for
victory. The rally ended as a horde
of screaming freshmen raced off into
the night, an indication that W&L’s
former spirit had returned.

SPE Wins Display

All eighteen fraternities partici-
pated in the successful Homecom-
ing display competition, which added
|much to the wekend. A committee
|of ten, representing the faculty,
| alumni, and local residents, judged
the various displays on Friday af-
ternoon. Prizes were awarded at
the football game for originality,
thought, effort, and appropriateness
of the theme. SPE captured first
prize, with a well-executed “Roll
the Tigers” complete with song.
Lamda Chi took second, followed by
Sigma Nu and Pi Phi.

Classes were shortened Saturday
to give students time to get seats be-
fore the opening kickoff. When the
| Generals took the field at 1:45 p.m.,
| the crowd rose to its feet and cheer-
ed. The ensuing struggle between
the Generals and the poyerful pur-
ple Tigers of Sewanee was one of
the greatest in Washington and Lee
annals. The Generals dominated the
play from the opening kick-off to
the final gun. As 4,000 students,
dates, faculty, and alumni cheered
louder than any crowd in recent
years, every General on the field

 

played his heart out.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Assimilation Referendum

The Tuesday Edition welcomes the an-
nouncement in last Friday’s Ring-tum Phi that
there will be a referendum held concerning
student body opinion on the Assimilation
Committee. We welcome this referendum, not
because we see the end of the Assimilation
Committee, but rather because we foresee an
endorsement of this committee by the student
body. This endorsement plus exact student
opinion on clothing standards has long been
needed by the committee.

It was sad after reading this announce-
ment on page one of Friday’s paper to turn
then to the second page and read a regrettable
column on the same matter. This column, en-
titled “A Fast Declining Institution,” was both
presumptuous and misrepresentative concern-
ing the Assimilation Committee. There is al-
ready too much misunderstanding about the
Assimilation Committee on campus, and this
column certainly did not help clear up any of
this. For the freshmen, for those who do not
know there is another side to this story.

The presumptions to be found in the
column last week are astounding. The column-
ist somehow feels himself competent to label
the Assimilation Committee a “‘dictorial little
cabel invested with the power of financial
punishment.” He assumes (presumably on the
basis of fifty students that signed the peti-
tion—many of whom wanted an endorsement
of the committee) that the Assimilation Com-
mittee has reached a “low degree of reputa-
tion and respect.”

It may indeed be true that the column-
ist’s personal opinion is such, but the opin-
ion certainly does not seem true for the ma-
jor portion of the student body. More im-
portant, the lack of understanding which is
shown by calling the committee cute little
names and implying that it enjoys extract-
ing one dollar fines from students is exactly
what the Assimilation Committee has had to
fight all along. An assimilation fine is only
given grudgingly, and then only to perpet-
ual offenders or students who show lack of
respect for conventional dress. No one on
the committee enjoys fining another stu-
dent, despite what uninformed students may
think.

The columnist goes on to tell us that “ex-
perience and observation” will show that the
“average W&L student” will assimilate some-
one “for only two reasons—as a joke or...
a petty vendetta.” Why not go to someone
who really has experience and observation, a
member—past or present—of the Assimila-
tion Committee. He will admit that instances
of this type do happen, but he will also tell
you that the two above reasons are not the only
reasons, and hardly the major reasons for
assimilations.

But so much for muddy water already over
the dam. Let us view the Assimilation Com-
mittee in more positive terms. What has the
Committee done thus far this year? What
about the “tradition” of conventional dress?
Is the Assimilation Committee really needed?
Finally, what about the standards of dress
here?

Brooks Brown, Chairman of the Assimila-
tion Committee, has been working all fall to
engender in the students a respect and under-
standing for the committee. There has been
an effort to stress the causes for rules and the
necessity for cooperation among students.
Every case brought before the committee is
dealt with in a personal manner, with due con-
sideration for genuine mistakes and unavoid-
able instances. Beanies were dropped for the
more “respectable” and easier to keep name
tags. Standards of conventional dress were
made clear to all students in a pre-school let-
ter, and stressed to freshmen at camp. With
an increased understanding of why and how
the Assimilation Committee works, there has
been an increased respect for the group by
the student body.

 

At the crux of the matter, however, is
the age old question: “Do we really need an
Assimilation Committee?” Attacks on the
Assimilation Committee usually take this
form: “Well, conventional dress is supposed
to be a tradition here, and traditions are not
supposed to be enforced (i.e., everyone
follows traditions willingly). So why have
an Assimilation Committee? Student opin-
ion will keep dress standards high on this
campus.” Admitting that the whole idea of

“tradition” is a tricky business, let us look
to our really time honored tradition . . . the
Honor System. Here we also have a tradi-
tion that most of us deem to be worthwhile,
a tradition that we look to the student body
to uphold, and at the same time we have
the Executive Committee to handle the ac-
tual cases. The Assimilation Committee pro-
vides the same type function for the tradi-
tion of conventional dress.

The only real bone that some members of
the student body have to pick with the As-
similation Committee is that of the actual
standards that are to be considered “‘conven-
tional dress.” Tastes differ, but the basic ap-
parel that marks a gentleman does not. For
this reason the Assimilation Committee has
tried to work within the “spirit of convention-
al dress,” rather than the letter of the law.

The basis rudiments of a coat, tie, slacks,
and socks have always been recognized both
by the committee and the student body.

It is now the hope of the Assimilation
Committee, as voiced by Chairman Brown,
that the students will make its views on the
particulars of conventional dress plain in the
referendum. The committee will draw up the
referendum in such a way as to give the stu-
dents a full choice on all the current issues
concerning what is to be the standard of
gentlemanly dress here.

While it must be remembered that the
forthcoming referendum is not a constitu-
tional referendum, it could pave the way for
major changes in the idea of conventional
dress as applied to the campus. This places
a great responsibility on the students—and
indeed this is where the responsibility should
lie. Each student must think about exactly
what he wants his campus to look like. It
is the hope of the Tuesday Edition that an
endorsement of the Assimilation Committee
as well as a vote for high standards of dress
will be forthcoming in the referendum.

Law School Ties

Last week the law school sent 21 men to
have their pictures taken for the law section
of the yearbook. This fraction of about one-
eighth of the law students is unrepresentative
of the law school and will appear so in the
Calyx, which this year, as every year recently,
must solve the problem of how to feature such
a small number as being the W&L law school
student body. We hope that, rather than
printing the pictures of this fraction of law
students, the Calyx will leave the law pictures
out entirely this year and merely list the names
of the law student body.

 

If the law school expects to be pictured
in the yearbook it should be able to round up
at least a majority of students willing to have
their pictures taken. The trouble is that the
law school does not want to be in the Calyx,
nor does it have much of a desire for any con-
nection at all with the undergraduate student
body. Law students are not generally interested
in the Ring-tum Phi, nor the Southern Col-
legian, nor the Calyx and understandably;
since there is only a small amount of space
devoted to the law school by these publica-
tions. Underlying this is a dissocation of Tuck-
er Hall from the rest of the campus which has
become more and more obvious lately.

The situation has worsened in the last few
years as the law school has received more and
more graduates of other colleges. The new
law school student body has fewer interests
in common with the college. Few law students
attend undergraduate activities; almost none
concern themselves with undergraduate prob-
lems. Law students are virtually never assimi-
lated perhaps because they are not taken for
members of the student body—and honor
system cases from the law school are unheard
of. Although law students compose one-third
of the Executive Committee, probably the
great majority of law students want nothing
to do with campus politics.

There are occasions, such as the Mock
Conventions, when cooperation between the
law school and the college is beneficial. And
the law students on the EC must be valuable
members in honor system trials because of
their familiarity with legal procedure. But
some mandatory ties between the two schools,
as in the case of the Calyx, may have become
unreasonable. This is a problem which de
serves study and perhaps action by the Execu-
tive Committee,

 

 

Percy Republican of the Future,
Despite Goldwater - Linked Loss

By JIM De YOUNG

(Editor’s Note: Jim De Young is
a friend of the Percy family. He was
associated with Percy’s campaign the
last two summers, and he was work-
ing in Percy’s headquarters in Chi-
cago the night of the election.
De Young has also found that
Percy’s grandfather taught at W&L
Charles B. Percy, B.S., C.E., Assist-
ant Professor of Applied Mathemat-
ics and Chemistry, 1870.

As he went down to stunning de-
feat last Tuesday, Barry Goldwater
carried many outstanding men with
him, among them Charles H. Per-

 

Charles

cy, Republican gubernatorial can-|
didate in the state of Illinois. Rich-|
ard Nixon had singled out Percy’s|
race for the governorship as the most
important single race in the nation
aside from the Presidency itself.
Percy had been labeled the dy-
namic Republican in this campaign,
the man of the future for the Re-
publicans. He had been elected Pres-|

 

Progress. He had also been appoint,
ed Chairman of the Republican
Party’s 1960 Platform Committee. He
had become President of Bell and
Howell Company at 29 and had
been elected Chairman of the Board
in 1961, a position he still holds.
The Chicago Daily News had
remarked of Percy’s candidacy.
“Good men seldom go into poli-
tics, and that’s one big reason gov-
ernment serves the people as in-
differently as it does. Charles H.
Percy is the ablest man to enter
the political scene for many years.
He is the man who can wrest this

Percy

state from the machine politicians,
the hoodlums, the incompetents
and put it on the high road of ef-
ficiency and _ progress... Illinois
stands on the threshold of great-
ness and Charles Percy can open
the door.”

Yet Chuck Perey went down in
defeat at the hands of incumbent
governor Otto Kerner by a margin

ident of the United States Republi-| of some 160,000 votes. (Kerner 218,000

can Fund in 1955, and he had been |
selected by President Eisenhower in|
1959 to be chairman of the Repub-|
lican Committee on Program and!

plurality in Chicago, Percy 60,000
down state.) Perey had traveled
250,000 miles in the campaign and
shook some 750,000 hands. He had

 

fought a tireless campaign against
what proved to be overwhelming
odds. His wife, Lorraine, his twin
19-year-old daughters, Valerie and
Sharon, and his 17-year-old son,
Roger, had been outstanding in their
endeavors.

Why then the defeat? The inner
circle of his brain trust and the can-
didate himself concluded that there
were no serious errors in the cam-
paign. A few problems could have
been handled differently, but the
Percy camp felt that the election
outcome would not have really been
effected.

As for the Goldwater issue, the
Percy organization believed that
renouncing Goldwater or going all
out for him would have resulted
in disaster. The Percy headquarters
had received as early as August a
poll report that Goldwater would
lose by 800,000 votes and that
Percy would lead Goldwater by
600,000 votes. As it turned out
Goldwater lost by 900,000 votes
and Perey led Goldwater by ap-
proximately 700,000 votes. In short
then, Percy was aware in August
that he could lose by some 200,000
votes,

Could Percy then have run a Rom-
ney campaign in Illinois? The answer
is no for several reasons. Romney
was an incumbent and he had buil
a large and strong following and
had an_ outstanding record of
achievement. Goldwater was also
much less popular in Michigan than
he was in Illinois.

Percy's Goldwater strategy was
also built through a series of steps,
each being taken as the result of
an immediate pressing problem that
had to be solved on the spot.

Some thought the timing in the
“Goldwater affair” was not appro-
priate. It was felt that if Perey had
waited to announce his vote for
Goldwater at the convention rather
than in June, the result would have
been different.

Percy felt the pressure and puwbli-
city on this question, and he felt he
would have been hurt whenever the
decision had been made. He said that
he wouldn’t have felt comfortable
divorcing himself from the Gold-
water issue. He said he was a party
man and that he couldn’t quit on a
member of the party.

Percy also cited two other ele-
ments that may have taken votes
from him, One was circulation of
a leaflet in Jewish neighborhoods
implying Percy had condoned
anti-Semitic hiring policies at his
Bell and Howell firm. Percy felt
that this pamphlet had disastrous
results at first, But statement by

The Sin They Won't Forgive: Energy

They have failed to see the energy, | manding, that is secure, and that is

enthusiasm, and zest for living in
us that they feel has traditionally
been characteristic of youth.
Some have cried loud and long:
“Where is the pursuit of excellence?”
or “Where is the creative energy
in these people?” The answer they
most often get is a sleepy silence.
But to some extent, we must ask
ourselves hese same questions.
Whether or not we want to listen
to these self-styled reformers, we
must recognize that what they have
seen is a real problem. I think a
quick look around will show us
that most of us are bored, lazy, and
tired. We are in many ways old men.
At Washington and Lee, most of
us were born with exceptional in-
telligence, more adequate means of
survival, and a quite acceptable de,
gree of security. Yet what most of
us want is a life that is not too de-

its center, old friendships dissolved,
ministers ousted from their pulpits,
vicious manifestations of
prejudice, I have developed a hor-
ror in matters where emotions reign
supreme. My personal views on in-
tegration are not important, but Mr
Baur's irrational and pathetic emo-
tionalism is an insidious threat te
any sane Christian society. Mr. Baur
is certainly entitled to his own opin-
ions, but in the interests of the stu-
dent bedy fer which he is so con-
cerned, he should perhaps put a lit-
tle more thoughts into his statements
lest they be taken as the opinion of
even a amall percentage of the Stu-
dent Bedy. The liklihood of this hap-
pening, though, is highly improbable

1 suggest that Mr. Baur sign up
for Sociology 101 (anthropology),
and perhaps Religion 201 (Christian
ethics). Then he would have suffi-

|eclent grounds on which to build an

socially compatible. Few of us are
innovators, few of us creative, few
of us want to develop resources
which we were born to. An occa-
sional spurt of energy is usually
crushed by a pervasive, omnipotent
indolence that characterizes most of
our existence.

There is even considerable evi-
dence that we resent energy and
creativity in those around us. There
is, at Washington and Lee, an al-
most immediate and overwhelming
rejection of someone who is too an-
xious, too eager, too enthusiastic,
or too ambitious. The way to get in-
to the right fraternity is to be cool,
almost indifferent. The one who is
most admired is the one who gets
by with the most (either in aca-
demics, with girls, or in most other

ways) with the least effort. The
cool one is the one who doesn't
try.

Recently a committee formed for
the specific purpose of making mon-
ey for a certain cause rejected an
applicant who had spent a great deal
of time and effort devising and mak-
ing possible a profitable scheme. I
am not certain of the reasons that
committee had, but it seems to me
that at least part of the cause was
that the applicant had been so en-
ergetic, so ambitious, and so eager
that the committee was afraid to
accept him

Booters Edge Roanoke; Get NCAA Bid

Jackson Scores Winning Goal;
Kickers Prepare For Tourney

By BOB CARTER
Tuesday Sports Writer
Washington and Lee’s soccer team
beat Roanoke College, 1-0, Friday
in a game played in Roanoke. Sat-
urday, the Generals received a bid
to the NCAA soccer tournament
and a top seeding in the state tour-
ney to take place at Lynchburg

College.

The NCAA bid is the first in the
history of the school’s soccer pro-
gram and the only one since the
1930’s when the basketball team
went to a national tournament.

The College division of he NCAA
championships will take place at
Tufts College in Medford, Massa-
chusetts, a suburb of Boston. W&L
is one of four teams to participate in
the tourney.

Three teams represent three dif-

when an assist from center-forward
Tim Henry set up the 20-yard shot.

The game was a hard fought one
as four of W&L’s players were in-
jured. Star Dave Kilpatrick is out |

Gridders Receive Praise

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Columnist

It seems kind of silly to be writing about the game of this past Saturday
because almost everybody in the student body was in attendance there,
and those that were not probably wish they had been. Speaking of at-
tendance and spirit, 1 might make mention of the fine job by the student
body in getting behind the team and helping them get up for the game.

The pep rally Friday night had a great effect on the team. It showed
them that the students are behind them in full force, a factor in boosting
team morale. The spirit also seemed to be catching in that the attendance
at the game was phenomenal. I believe wholeheartedly that another rally
is in order for the season finale against Washington University,

Everybody Ran Well
There were many individuals who deserve special mention for their
performances, but there were some who really stood out like diamonds.
The running backs, Harry Brookby, Dan Manson, Bill David, Tom Cren-
shaw, Skip Chase,, and, of course, Tom Sparks, were each and every one-
outstanding. Brookby’s hard slicing drives were an inspiration in them-

 

selves. Manson continues his hard running ways while David played a la|
Charlie Taylor with his dancing and twisting runs. Crenshaw ran as if|
there were a pot of gold waiting for him in the end zone, while Chase!
always managed to come up with a few more yards then seemed possible. |
And what could be said about Sparks that is uncomplimentary. He only
gained 145 yards in 20 carries, and he ran over, around or through any-
one that might be in his way. His running style is reminiscent of Jim
Taylor's.

No amount of praise is great enough to equal that which quarterback
Larry Craig deserves, and the same may be said about Craig's replacement
Bryant Kendrick. They called almost faultless games and came up with
the big play habitually. On third down and four or five to go it would be
Craig to David on the break out or hook pattern for the first down or
Sparks or Crenshaw through the line for the necessary yardage.

The blocking was fantastic, but one man stood out above all the others
as I saw it. That was guard Tom Day. Day, with the assistance of Wicky
Stuart and Bill Sledge, was the main reason for the monstrous holes
opened up for Sparks. Day also displayed some of the best running blocks
that I've seen at W&L.

Rugged Defense

 

And then there was the defense. Ends Tersh Baker and Rob Reading
along with linebackers Joe Miller and Jeff Novinger, were the men most
responsible for Bill Johnson's miserable day. Baker and Reading de- |
stroyed blockers time after time, leaving Johnson at the merey of Miller |
and Novinger. Baker also applied a fierce pass rush, hel :

Top—Harry Brookby bolts into the endzone from the one as official gives
word to 4,000 wild General fans. Tigers later match this score, but field
goal and safety give W&L win.

Bottom—Tom Crenshaw works his way into the open after being sprung
by the block of Tom Day (64) as as senior fullback leads Generals on-
slaught.

 

Baker was also the main cause of the Sewanee safety, with aid from|
Logan Bullitt and Jack Kelly. Bullit, Kelly, and Starke Sydnor protected |
the middle as if their lives depended on their stopping enemy ball carriers. |
David, Craig, and Billy Andrews patrolled the defensive backfield like old!
pros with David and Craig batting down important passes. Andrews, all
155 pounds at most just roamed around knocking down stray ball carriers. |

The only play causing distress for the W&L team and fans was when |
Johnson rambled 94 yards with Reading’s kickoff following Brookby’s |
touchdown plunge. There was some question in the press box as to the |
advisibility of kicking deep. There were only a few seconds remaining in
the half, and an onside kick would have been covered by a Sewanee line- |
man with little or no return and with no time for another play.

Reading commented, I put the ball exactly where I wanted it, but John- |
son ran over and took it right out of the hands of the other deep man.” |
Coach Lee McLaughlin took the blame for the mistake in strategy and ad-
mitting at halftime that the thought of an onside kick never occurred to
him, but it would have been a good idea.

Generals Beat Tigers 11-6;

The unbeaten, nationally-ranked Sewanee Tigers came to
town Saturday and probably wish now that they had stayed

more in keeping with the high level
of thought hopefully prevalent at
W&L. As it stands now, we have
only Mr. Baur’s highly enlightened
personal insight, obtained perhaps
intuitively, concerning such a vast
area as integration at W&L invol-
ves. I cannot conceive of a student
body purportedly guided by the per-
sonal convictions of Robert E. Lee
gamboling about in white sheets
and burning crosses—and this is a
most common result of the line of
thought inherent in Mr. Baur’s argu-
ment.

I agree with Mr. Baur when he
says that one should not recruit
colored students just because they
are Negroes. However, his advice
for the students that do so to enroll
in Hampton Institute is petty, and
again, irrational. He assumes the role
of one who knows what is best for
W&L, when it has been so clearly
demonstrated that the Board of
Trustees, who know a little more of
the matter than Mr. Baur, think dif-
ferently.

I prefer to heed the decision of
these gentlemen, and in the spirit
of Mr. Baur’s letter advise him to
go elsewhere if he feels his personal
interests cannot exist within the
decisions governing aspects of our
life here at W&L.

JERRY COFFMAN

The Editor

The enthusiastic spirit at last Sat-
urday’s football triumph was as-
tonishing. For once the student body
was not too sophisticated to cheer
for the team and the results are
evident. Perhaps if this spirit could
be continued, W&L could again have
nationally
sports other than soccer, which
could benefit from a good show of
support from the student body be-
fore making its bid for the NCAA
championship.

To the Editor:

This letter should not be headed as
it is, but rather “Dear Students of
Washington and Lee,” for its con-
tents have to do with all of us who
partcipated in the events this week-
end. Anyway, no matter what the
title is or could be, I could not help
but sit down and write what fol-
lows...

A little over a week ago I wrote
an article concerning the spirit, or
rather, lack of spirit on the W&L
campus—much to my delight I saw
and heard spirit in its contagious
form on Saturday. Not only was
there spirit in the homecoming dec-
orations, but at the pep rally (per-
haps some became overzealous)
and, where it became most evident,
at the game. For the first time in
my three years on this campus did
I actually hear the crowd, they even
frequently stood up, and several in
the assemblage were “obnoxious”
enough to bring noisemakers such as
a cowbell, and some horns! We have
thanks to give to our cherleaders
from “The Hill,” and to a certain
“jolly ol’ soul” in the guise of one
R. E. Lee who popped up out of
nowhere!

The weekend has ended, and we,
the student body, can give ourselves
a pat on the back, for not only did
our representatives on the field give
us something to cheer about, but we
reciprocated by showing our enthus-
iasm for their endeavors. We de-
feated a strong team which is per-
haps our strongest opponent in the

conference (fortunately, Susque-
is not in our conference!).

easy to get a upper middle class
job which will make few exces-

In other words, there is little that
we have to do. For us to be active,

requires for us to consciously de-
decide to be. We have to force our-|
selves to do what our fathers were |
forced to do. This is, to be sure, a}
paradoxical problem. But it is one
which is bound to plague us more |
and more as our society finds in-|
creasingly better ways to make life |
easy for us.

This easy life we are producing,
so it seems, is not an easy one at all. |
For if it is to be full, creative, and!

we must force it to be that way.

my judgment that the “shenanigans”

result, the tone of future articles will
reflect the proper spirit of this or-

It also appears that the general con-

a reprieve until next week at least.

In assessing the campaign then,
Chuck Percy did remarkably well.
In essence he was trying to over-
come a 900,000 vote deficite. That

he came as close as he did is a |

remarkable achievement in itself.

His campaign was essentially a
good one. He had an outstanding
staff and a devoted group of vol-
unteers. His organization and at-
tention to details were also impres-
sive.

Percy was also criticized that he
did not put enough emphasis on the
conflict of interest charges in the
Kerner administration against Theo-
dore Isaacs, Kerner’s campaign
manager. Some people felt that if
Percy had hit upon this issue, he
would have had a larger margin
downstate than 60,000 votes. The
scandal had received scant mention
downstate in comparison to Cook
County.

Besides the Isaacs scandal, Percy
had little ammunition to work with,
except that he would be a bettter
and more effective governor. Voters

that his long range political future
is still extremely bright.

Percy may have won his spurs
in the million dollar gubernatorial
campaign, and he may yet apply
the skills and experience to making
the trip that will take him to
Washington. Our country needs
men of his caliber providing lead-
ership in both parties. I am confi-

He faces many challenges ahead,
but this man thrives on challenges.
As I left his headquarters Wednes-

notice that there was still an en-
thusiasm aglow in the bleary eyes
of his supporters that may put
him in the right seat yet.

Chuck Percy will be a rallying
point for a Republican party that
needs drastic help both in Illinois
and in the nation. He will step down
soon from his executive leadership
in Bell and Howell and devote his
time to public life.
