Beta Pledge

Beats Saunders
By Five Votes

By GARETH ADEN
Managing Editor

It was announced early yes- |)

terday afternoon that Richard
Nash, the University Party

candidate, had beaten Steve |
Saunders, an independent can- |

didate for the freshman rep-
resentative to the Executive Com-
mittee. Nash
against 141 cast for Saunders.

The narrow margin of five votes
climaxed a long and eventful cam-

paign for the freshman post. In the |
original election a week ago neither |

of these two candidates had been
able to poll a majority of the votes
cast. As a result they were pitted
in a run-off that was finally con-

cluded Monday. *

Small Turnout

Despite the excitement that the un-
usual election generated, the turn-
out at the polls yesterday was still
disappointing. Only 287 out of 338
of the freshman class turned in bal-
lots. This was an improvement on
the 267 that voted last week in the
original election, however.

Nash, obviously glad to have the
election over with, said he wanted to
thank those who had worked for
him and all who had voted for him.
He pledged to do his best in the
coming year in his new posit.on,
but declined at this time to make
any specific statement on the cam-
paign.

Saunders seemed to have taken the
news in stride. He made it clear
that he was not sorry he had run,
rather he felt that his campaign had
accomplished something. He felt that
he had proved a candidate could
run strongly even without the sup-
port of upper-classmen or party af-
filiation. Especially significant, said
Saunders was the fact that he had
been able to stop the party in the
first election.

He made it clear that he wisheJ
Nash the best of luck and was sure
that Nash would have the support
of the freshman class in the coming

year.

Varied Program Planned
During Parents Weekend

The
will follow the customary pattern
that has proven popular with par-
ents. Registration Friday afternoon
will be followed by personal facul-
ty conferences. These conferences
enable parents to discover reasons
for their sons’ shortcomings and
successes and have proved beneficial
to both parties in the past.

The main event will be the
freshman football game against
Fork Union Military Academy.
Coach Swan's Baby Generals have
been working hard this week in
anticipation of their first victory.
There will also be a meeting of
the 56-member Parents’ Advisory
Council and a Chemistry Seminar
on Friday afternoon.

The programs scheduled for Fri-
day evening will provide a picture
of the diversity of academics and
extracurriculars at W&L. They in-
clude three panel discussion by pro-

Freshmen Siehuter
Take Two Trophies

In Rosemont Meet

By DON OHARE

Tuesday Columnist

W&L debaters won two of six tro-
phies given at the Rosemont Invi-
tational meet in Philadelphia last
weekend. Rusty Meyer won the sec-
ond place speaker’s award, and his
teammate George Dover followed
with the third place award as the
pair went to a four and one record.

Jeff Wceinscott and Tommy Bare-
more completed the W&L team,
which was one of 26 four-man teams
in the tournament. It was the first
time, says director of forensics Wil-
liom Chaffin, that he has ever taken
an all-freshman team to a varsity
tournament.

One Negative Loss

In team competition, W&L finished
the weekend with a record of six
wins and four defeats. The negative
team of Meyer and Dover won four
of their five matches while Wains-
cott and Baremore, debating the
affirmative, won two and lost three.

The Negative team defeated
Princeton, Penn State, Temple, and
Scranton, while losing only to West
Point. The affirmative team recorded
victories over Rosemont and Rut-
gers, and lost one of their maches
to the tournament-winning team
from Seton Hall University (10-0).

Good Season Predicted

The W&L Debate Team will be
taking trips every weekend to
matches and tournaments all over
the East. The schedule will be high-
lighted by a tournament at George-
town University and a cross-exam-
ination meet at Pace College in New
York City.

According to Mr. Chaffin, debate
team director, the combination of
experience and enthusiasm demon-
strated by the varsity and freshmen
debaters this year points toward a
successful season for the Washing-
ton and Lee team.

The national debate topic for this
year is, Resolved: that the federal
government should undertake a pro-

Robert E. Lee Letter
Added To Archives

A letter written 100 years ago
this week by General Robert E. Lee,
in which he reflected his deeply re-
ligious nature, has been added to
the Lee Archives at Washington and
Lee University.

The letter is one of two brief let-
ters by Lee given to Washington and
Lee by Miss Ellinor Porcher Gads-
den, of Lexington, granddaughter of
the Rev. William Nelson Pendleton
who was Lee’s artillery commander
in the Army of Northern Virginia
during the Civil War, and to whom
the letters were addressed.

Dr. Ollinger Crenshaw, head of
Washington and Lee’s history de-
partment and chairman of the Lee
Archives committee, describes the
gift of Miss Gadsden’s letter as “a
most valuable addition to the uni-
versity’s collection of Lee papers.”

One letter was written on October
21, 1864, with Lee headquartered near
Chaffins Bluff between Richmond
and Petersburg, facing a long win-
ter’s siege by Generals Grant and
Meade and ultimate defeat at Ap-
pomattox the following April.

The second letter is dated August
28, 1865, when Lee was at Carters-
ville, Va., considering the invitation
of the Washington College trustees

The announcement that racial dis-
crimination will not enter into W&L
admissions policy was made for the
first time today, but the decision
was made last summer by the Board
of Trustees. The Trustees’ act came
in the form of a statement to the
faculty that admissions policies were
at the discretion of the professors,
who had favored integration pre-
viously.

At the first faculty meeting of this
year, President Cole told the facul-
ty of the Board’s step. Since then
rumor about approaching integration
has hovered over the W&L campus;
but the Board held back from a
public announcement. The Trustees
met again last weekend, and finally
authorized the President to release
the state prnited on page two of this
paper.

There are no applications from

» Negroes now being considered by

the Committee on Admissions. Ap-
parently no colored students will ap-
ply for the next school year, since
none have made thorough inquiries
to the admissions offices.

Resolution Power

The ODK Forum was established
last year to discuss questions of
concern to the University as a whole.
The body has the power of resolu-
tion, and thus can be a powerful
influence for or against administra-
tion policy.

The presidents of fraternities, cap-
tains of athletic teams, leaders of
campus organizations, and members
of ODK and the Executive Commit-
tee are invited to participate in the
Forum, founded last year by the
ODK Circle with the cooperation of
the EC.

The Inevitable Answer

Today’s statement from President Fred
C. Cole’s office (printed elsewhere on this
page) affirming that Washington and Lee
will not discriminate among applicants because
of race, is the inevitable answer to the question
of integration. It is the answer which the fac-
ulty probably would have given at least sev-
eral years ago, had the Board of Trustees
given it explicit opportunity as it has done in
the present statement. It is an answer confirm.
ing the policy of non-discrimination which has
always been implied in the University cata-
logue’s broad admission requirements. Al-
though it is bound to arouse some criticism,
it is the answer demanded by the present
world, and even more so, by the future. It
is the only answer possible if this University
is to continue to profess the high ideals which
have historically guided it and made it great.
It is an answer which prevents Washington
and Lee from becoming isolated from other
educational institutions, and it is one which re-
moves this school from the suspicion of pre-
judice. It is an answer of which the student
body can justly be proud, and which it should
actively support.

The answer came freely, not under the in-
fluence of direct pressure from any source. It
was under the initiative of the University, not
in response to an admissions “crisis.” No Ne-
gro has ever completed an application to
Washington and Lee, and so there has never
been a test case which would have established
precedent. Neither has there been any public
statement from the W&L Committee on Ad-
missions regarding the attitude it would take
toward Negro applicants.

This is not to say that there has never been
an “understood’’ policy of discrimination in
admissions, of what “would have happened” if
a Negro had applied; or that the statement
given to the Ring-tum Phi by President Cole
today does not represent an important step.
Yet during the past several years, as students
sought an answer to the question of integra-
tion, they never received refusals. Obviously
the question was in limbo, undecided for a
while; and it could only be finally resolved at
the Board of Trustees’ meeting last summer.
It is fortunate that the answer was at last given
freely, rather than from a defensive position.
Now the question which must be asked univer-
sally of every educational institution, can be
answered honorably at Washington and Lee.

What now? There are still no Negro ap-
plicants, and so the new statement of non-
discrimination may not even have been needed
this year, maybe not next. But sooner or later,
Negroes are going to apply to, be accepted by,
and enter this University. It is incumbent on
the Committee on Admissions to be certain
that these first Negro entrants are equal to
Washington and Lee’s high standards. Wa&L
cannot afford to accept outright the first Ne-
groes who apply, merely for the sake of boast-
ing an integrated student body. This is a mis-
take which some other institutions have made,
and one which can ruin the hope of a smooth
process of integration. If the first Negro en-
trants are anything less than their classmates,

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

 

then the impression they make here could be
harmful to a rapid integration in student life.
This is a consideration which must already
have entered the minds of the Committee.

But no matter how well qualified the first
colored students here, there will be some stu-
dents who will resent their presence. These
men will be faced with a reality, already ac-
cepted at most schools, which will be all the
more workable the sooner it is accepted here.
Some will be slow to reconcile themselves;
but prejudice opposed to reason should soon
disappear. The student body should realize
that the advantages of integration will far
outweigh the temporary discomforts of
change; that education insulated from the re-
ality of American life is incomplete.

It is unlikely, of course, that more than
several Negroes will enter any one class in the
foreseeable future. The decision to accept
qualified Negroes is not going to dilute the
student body, nor its quality. There will be
no rush, no flood of integration. Washington
and Lee is not going to change or lose its
character; actually the admissions statement is
not even a reversal of policy, since no Negroes
have ever been refused admission. Instead,
the statement is a confirmation of what has
always been true in W&L’s stated policies:
there has never been a policy of discrimina-
tion. The decision to affirm this fact was the
only decision possible in the Washington and
Lee tradition, a tradition of idealism and right
action.

It Happens Every Year

The University Party, as usual, pulled the
election out of the fire. With fifty freshmen
failing to vote, the Clique candidate squeaked
through by five votes, although without win-
ning a majority of his class. The margin of
Richard Nash’s victory was supplied by party
organization. Steve Saunders ran a good cam-
paign, but when voting day came around,
more of his voters stayed home than did
Nash’s, prodded by the Party. The University
Party’s win is good evidence of its strength;
and a bad sign for any candidates for spring
elections who may happen not to be in the
Party.

Nash is very well qualified to hold the of-
fice he has won and should be a valuable
member of the Executive Committee. That
he would be a popular candidate was apparent
from the first Ring-tum Phi preferential bal-
loting several weeks ago. According to some
thinking, Nash actually was considered such
a strong candidate that the new University
Party was formed to nominate him.

Nash proved his appeal, as well as the fine
organization of his Party, by pulling out the
election. But the number of independent can-
didates who originally opposed him, and the
closeness of the final tally, are hopeful indi-
cations that in the spring campus politics may
turn away from Clique Control. Perhaps next
spring it will not even be beyond the realm
of possibility for an independent candidate
to be nominated by popular voice and to win
an election against the Party.

 

“That Democratic anti-poverty drive is really paying off
for old Lyndon’s campaign, isn’t it.”

Admission Rules Up To Faculty;
No Race Discrimination at W &L

Washington and Lee University’s
Board of Trustees has reaffirmed the
university faculty’s responsibility in
determining standards of admission
for qualified applicants.

President Fred C. Cole said today
that “The Board of Trustees has no
cause to doubt the appropriateness
of this delegation of authority to the
faculty and has no cause to doubt
the collective wisdom of the faculty
in discharging the concomitant re-
sponsibility.”

In response to an inquiry from the
editors of the Ring-tum Phi, Presi-
dent Cole said the Board considered
the University’s admissions policy
at its meeting on July 25,

Said President Cole:

“It was noted that no provision
of the Charter, no provisions of
the By-laws and no resolution of
of the Board has established a
policy of discrimination among
qualified applicants for admission,

 

Traditionally, matters pertaining to
the qualifications of applicants for
admission have been entrusted to
the Faculty and its appropriate
committees, and the By-laws of
the University so provide.”

A faculty Committee on Admis-
sions at Washington and Lee, which
reports to the general faculty, is
composed of nine professors from the
College and the School of Commerce
and Administration and four mem-
bers of the University’s administra-
tive staff.

Dr. Edward C. Atwood, Jr., dean
of students and professor of eco-
nomics, is chairman of the commit-
tee. Its members are:

Dr. C. Westbrook Barritt, profes-
sor of Romance languages; Dr. Syd-
ney M. B. Coulling, associate pro-
fessor of English; Mr. John M.
Gunn, Jr., assistant professor of
economics; Dr. Leonard E. Jarrard,
associate professor of psychology;

 

Dr. William A. Jenks, professor of
history; Mr. John K. Jennings, as-
sistant professor of journalism; Dr.
Cecil D. Jones, associate professor
of fine arts; Mr. Henry L. Raven-
horst, associate professor of engi-
neering; Dr. Edgar W. Spencer, pro-
fessor of geology; Associate Dean of
Students James D. Farrar, director
of admissions; Assistant Dean of Stu-
dents Lewis G. John, director of
financial aid; and Dean, Emeritus,
Frank J. Gilliam, former dean of
admissions.

The committee reviews all app.i-
cations for admissions to Washing-
ton and Lee and selects the 330 to
340 students who annually compose
the entering undergraduate class.

A separate admissions committee
functions within the School of Law.
The faculty there has the same dele-
gation of authority and responsibili-
ity for admissions to the School of
Law as that possesed by the facul-
ty in the College.

 

Local Deities Called On the Carpet

By JOHN KIRKLEY

Let’s test a few idols.

Such as University Assemblies;
most of them are quite dull and
trite: it is amazing that gentlemen
with Ph.D.’s should speak so long
and say so little. The first really
interesting idea to come up in the
past several years is the suggestion
to create a Lee College in the hills—
it would be better if this were to be
a girl’s school. That way our life
around here would be more natural
and realistic. The whole monastic,
ascetic tradition (which did keep
scholasticism alive during Dark and
Middle Ages), on which some of our
current academic ideas are still
based, was, after all, a bit per-
verted—bald men communing pri-
vately each with himself in his own
cold little cell—and with Deity.

And how about homework and
discipline? It is most probably
true that man is a problem-solv-
ing and goal-striving animal and
that one should boldly confront
problems which face him and use
reason to figure out what is best
to do and should then do it. But
this is discipline for a purpose. But

is this what Washington and Lee

 

Letters To The Editor

 

is trying to teach us? Or is the
emphasis on the mere acquisition
of factual knowledge? Does the
mere possession of factual knowl--
edge help us to sove problems?
Such emphasis is frustrating for
one can never know everything.
All our decisions must be based on
incomplete knowledge, and in-
complete experience furthermore;
we can never be sure that what
we decide to do is right, but must
we not do our best anyway and
accept the consequences of our ac-
tion?

Does the weighing down of the
students with great time burdens di-
rected towards the acquisition of
knowledge help them at all? And can
teachers conscientiously assign more
than eight out-of-class hours work
per week per course? Because if
students have to lose sleep to do
their homework, they become tired
then ennervated then frustrated
then sickly, narrow, easily irritated,
ete. And if all our time is filled up
by mere assignments, how are we to
do extra work in those few subjects
which might interest or excite us?

And what about conventional
dress, the speaking tradition,

 

spirit, fraternities, and the Honor
System? Here the whole empha-
sis is on sameness, on developing
a smooth well-ordered, machine-
like society in which persons slide
easily by one another without
passion or excitement or discom-
comfort, like marbles in oil. Are
not all these institutionalizations of
what .might .have once ..meant
something to certain individuals
asking us to accept as our own the
ideas and forms and ways of liv-
ing accepted by others?

Do not these, like Christianity,
offer us a system or way of life and
ask us to accept it on faita? And
if we accept them on faith are we
not giving up our right to determine
our lives according to our own
choices? And, after all, are not all
these old traditions excruciatingly
middle class? But then, from all I
hear, we students are as dully con-
servative and bourgeois as the school
we attend and its Board of Trustees.

Well, I guess that is enough for
now. It always pains me somewhat
to come down from House Mountain
where the air is pure and the colors
lovely to dwell for a short time in

Dear Sir:

“What is spirit?”—‘Spirit is con-
tagious, sir!” This is a vocal drill
for one of the fraternities on the
W&L campus, and, as seen at the
last two home football games, it
seems to hold true. Realizing that
there have been a multitude of ar-
ticles and letters to the editor con-
cerning spirit I still thought it in
the best interest of all that what
follows be written

Freshmen at Washington and Lee
have been a part of the school ap-
proximately nine weks, and so are
unfamiliar with the total outlook at
this institution. They have not as
yet been able to grasp the meaning
of four years ahead of them—they
wear a coat and tie only because
their elders tell them that it’s the
thing to do, they keep on the side-
walks for the same reason, and the
Honor System is maintained through
fear, and the novelty of the Idea

In my estimation freshmen ean
feel no real spirit, for they have not
been told that everyone cheers at the
football or basketball games—mainly |
no one does. It seems odd|
that a school so bound by the tra-
ditions of honor, gentlemanly con-
duct, and self-government should!
fail so miserably in arousing any/
boisetrous voeal support. As stated |
before, we are one, a body of minds, |
grouped together in an institution,
which grounds itself on pride, and
personal initiative. Why, if we hold
our place with the “firsts” in Amer-/
iean education, can we not harness!
some Of our pride to our own gain’

 

because

like a morgue on Saturday after-
noons (save a small group at the
West end, consistently outnumbered
10 to 1, which makes enough racket
for their own squad to put W&L to
shame).

What brings our lack of spirit?
Is it that there can be no drinking
at the games (that is where the
blame usually falls). Is it that the
spectators venture to the stands
just to see TD's rolled up for or
against us, and are oblivious to the
actual play itself? Perhaps one could
well say that the student body has
no confidence in the eleven men on
the field at any one time. It seems
apparent that the viewers of the
game at Washington and Lee take
the action on the field for granted,
and only attend the games for lack
of something better to do.

Having played football for two
years at Washington and Lee I can
appreciate the effort that goes into
every game. I have stood at the
sidelines in uniform and have heard
the silence behind me, as though
the contest was being held in the
the midst of a Wilderness. A team
should, in many ways, play both as
a unit and for itself. But the loneli-
ness facing the W&L squad by lack
of support is both unnecessary and
completely ridiculous

The student body stands up at
the kickoffs, yes, but only from
the pressure of social convention,
and because one sitting down at the
time could not see anything but reas

W&L Booters Down King College,

General Errors

-()

WEL Blanked ‘By Hampden- Syduey, 21-0

Costly In Loss

By JAMES CROTHERS

Two fumbles and a Hampden-
Sydney interception led Saturday to
all three Tiger scores as Washing-
ton and Lee dropped its third
straight contest and fourth of five
this season.

The Generals’ 21-0 loss to the visi-
tors this weekend extended W&lL’s
scoreless streak to 13 fruitless quar-
ters. The losers controlled play, es-
pecially, during the second half, and
stayed even in the battle of statistics,
However Washington and Lee’s in-
ability to move the pigskin within
the Tiger 15-yard line continued to
to plague W&L.

Lipscomb Scores Two

Hampden-Sydney’s junior quarter-
back Whitey Lipscomb scored the
Tiger’s two second quarter tallies
with sneaks. The first score came
early in the second stanza when a
General fumble gave the visitors
an opportunity on the W&L 27.

After Lipscomb’s score and Ty
Tysinger’s PAT, General signal
caller Larry Craig had an aerial

session again on the W&L 28. Lips-

comb and Tysinger again couplede_-

for the seven points to put Hamp-|,
den-Sydney ahead at halftime, 14-0.
WA&L Drive Fails

The third quarter featured a sus-|
tained W&L drive which fell short

as the Tigers defense stiffened on
their 4-yard line. The Generals
forced the Tigers to punt, but

on the first series of downs Craig) 0%

dropped back to pass from his own
12, his arm was hit and Hampden-
Sydney recovered on the W&L
four-yard line. George Summers
scored for the Tigers with Tysinger
adding the twenty-first point to end
the day’s scoring.

Win A Few..

Lose A Few...

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Columnist

Year after year the football team
at W&L, whether good or bad, at-
tracts the greatest amount of stu-
dent attention of all the athletic
clubs during the fall months. This
season in particular the football
team has given the students very
little reason to cheer, yet the at-
tendance at the first two games
has been an increase over the at-
tendance at the first two games last
year. As a matter of fact, the size

of the crowd at Saturday’s game

was downright astonishing.

The soccer team, on the other
hand, has been having a fantastic
season and has drawn very sparse
crowds. Of course, the soccer team
is not blessed with the best facilities
with respect to their playing field.
Joe Lyles’ boys play on the base-
ball field, which is more rock than
turf. The stands are less than ade-
quate because they are a fairly good
distance away from the field, being
placed there for the primary pur-
pose of providing a resting place for
baseball fans.

Seats Needed

This lack of seating facilities tends} -
to prohibit spectators from attend-
ing the games. It's a funny thing
about the average American specta-
tor; he likes to have a place to rest
his weary feet while he spectates.

It seems to me that the University
should do something to rectify the
situation, even though the best so-

your thoughts. If

 

lution may entail the expenditure of
a goodly sum of money. This solu-
tion is to build a field for the sole
use of the soccer team.

There is enough unused land in
the vicinity of the baseball field
that a grade A soccer field is defi-
nitely not out of the question. It
is a shame that with a soccer team
as good as the one at W&L this
season no one attends the games
because the facilities for players and
spectators alike are just plain lousy.

Equal Time fer Booters

The Civil Rights Bill makes every-
one equal and politicians are given
equal time on television. Let's give
the soecer players facilities equal
to those which we give the football
club. They are definitely deserving
of it.

It is degrading to Washington and
Lee as a University to have a soccer
team that stands an excellent chance
to win the State title and that has as
a member an All-American candi-
date like Dave Redmond and yet
doesn’t even have its own field. This
situation demands correction in or-
der that the students will feel free
to come watch a truly good team at
work.

W&L Harriers Beat C.U.
Up Record To 4-1

Washington and Lee’s cross-coun-
try team brought its record to four
victories against one defeat as the
Generals defeated Catholic Univer-
sity of Washington, 20-41.

Running on Catholic’s 3.1 mile
course, the harriers managed
win six of the first seven places.
A Catholic runner took first place
in 16:08 minutes, setting a new
course record. Andy Kilpatrick fin-
ished second, and Lee Johnson third,
for the Generals with times of 16:24
and 16:26 respectively. W&L took
the next four places with only 13
seconds separating the first six W&L
runners.

Henry & Shinkle Score As

Generals Record 6th Win

The Washington and Lee soccer team continued its unde-
feated and untied pace shutting out King College, 3-0, at Bris-
tol, Tennessee Oct. 23 for its sixth victory.

After a scorless first quarter, Brad Shinkle tallied the first
W&L goal in about eight minutes into the second quarter.
Shinkle’s goal came on a pass from John Van Bork about 20

 

Frosh Gridders Lose, 3-0
Staunton Military Wins On
Second Quarter Field Goal

By DAVE DOUGHERTY

The Hilltoppers of Staunton Mili-
tary Academy, a perennial prep titan
in the South, protected a thin lead
provided by the 30-yard field goal
of Dick Milkerson to down the up-
start Washington and Lee freshmen,
3-0, last Friday.

Staunton, who had previously tied
national powerhouse Bordentown
Military Academy of New Jersey in
a 0-0 bout, was paced by an enor-
mous line anchored by 225 pound
middle guard Bill Scheib. The Hill-
topper line stymied all General ef-
forts as it concentrated on the hard
running General fullback Bill Me-
David as the key of the W&L of-

In the only scoring thrust of the
afternoon, Staunton recovered an
Andy Bloom fumble on the General
46 yard line, and through the pass-
ing hook-ups of quarterbacks Jim
Paldin and Ralph Spulock with
their fancy end Charles Blackburn,
the Hilltoppers moved to the General
12. Here the revived W&L bulwark
stiffened and repeatedly slapped
down the cadets on the vital series.
On fourth down, after being per-
fectly set-up at midfield with a
third down run, Melkerson stood
just behind the 20 and split the
uprights with his boot from place-
ment.

McDavid led the W&L charges to
several scoring opportunities, but in
each instance the mammoth Staun-
ton defense repelled the Brigadiers.
On one occasion Washington and Lee
drove into Staunton territory only
to have a stray aerial intercepted
by Blackburn on the 36 and returned
to the W&L 12. The second half was
not quite as eventful as the Gen-
erals managed only two first downs
in crossing the midfield stripe only
once.

out. Center forward Tim
in six minutes in the third quarter
on another pass from John Van
Bork. Henry also tallied the final
W&L goal on an assist from left
halfback Bruce Jackson near the
end of the third quarter.

King College’s only real scoring
threat came at the start of the game,
but goalie Bob Larus handled all
scoring attempts. It was an easy
day for Larus who had to handle
only six scoring chances the entire
game whereas W&L had 21 scoring
attempts.

Defense Stars

The defensive team of Howard
Busse, Dave Redman, and All-
American candidate Pete Preston
once again thwarted the opposition’s
scoring threat. This unit has allow-
ed only four goals in 6 games while
the Generals’ offense has scored 18
goals in six games for an average of
3 goals per game.

Center halfback Jim Walter played
an outstanding game for King Col-
lege. The King College coach praised
the efforts of W&L players Dave
Kirkpatrick, right inside and Brad
Shinkle, center forward Tim
Henry, and right wing John Van
Bork. Halfbacks Bruce Jackson and
Fred Skinner turned in an out-
standing defensive game.

Team Is Ready

Coach Lyles said, “The difference
in this year and last year is the
experience of the first team, the
team is mentally and physically
ready, and the team wants to go
all the way if possible. The dedica-
tion is the best of any University
team.”

Saturday at 3:15 the Generals play
host to American University of
Washington, D.C. American Univer-
sity is undefeated in the northern
division of the Mason-Dixon Con-
ference and its team is composed
of over half foreigners with much
experience. W&L won last year 2-1
