Johnson Policy

Nutter Says Depression
Not Likely This Year; Hits

Johnson’s New Tax Cut

By Gareth Aden and
Rod Boren

Dr. G. Warren Nutter, Chairman of
the Economics Department at the Uni-
versity of Virginia, spoke last night
at duPont Auditorium. Dr. Nutter
was lecturing by virtue of the invi-
tation of the Young Republicans or-
ganization on campus.

The topic of the lecture was ‘Eco
nomic Policies of the Johnson Ad-
ministration.” Dr. Nutter has long
been an accepted authority on na-
tional economies and recently served
as an economic advisor to Barry
Goldwater.

Dr. Nutter began the program by

 

Dr. G. Warren Nutter speaking
to students and faculty at duPont
Auditorium Monday night.

 

analysing the new outlook of the peo-*
ple on the Presidency. He explained
that John Kennedy was the first step
in this change, due to the fact that
Kennedy represenaed something spe- |
cial and different to everyone. The
same is true of Johnson, said Nutter
except in a more calculated sense.
Johnson has made sure to promise
something to every economic group.
What to Expect

From this point Dr. Nutter launched
a long analysis of what to expect from
the Johnson administration. In John-
son’s attempt to please everyone, said
Nutter, he will continue a constant
inflationary policy. It was implied also
that the President would make sure
that there was not a business depres-
sion of any sort on an election year, by
regulating the economy in the right
fashion.

A number of administration pro-
grams have already been initiated,
he pointed out. First Johnson instigat-
ed a large, and according to Nutter,
unnecessary tax cut. Dr. Nutter ex-
plained that this tax cut had already
inflated too quickly and should have
been done more slowly. To alleviate
the inflation the tax cut had caused,
claimed Nutter, the discount interest
rates and debts were risen. The admin-
istration has also recently spent two
billion dollars on securities.

In the area of future legislation, Nut-
ter said to expect no stable policy from
the administration. “It will be pointed
to give a little to everybody, but in the
long run will accomplish very little,”
said the lecturer. Some small form
of Medicare Bill through social secur-
ity is to be expected, and if there is
to be any transfer of money, it will be
from young to old rather than rich
to poor. Nevertheless said Dr. Nutter,
there will be plenty more “War on
Poverty” programs.

Johnson's policy toward both labor
and management will be equally con-
ciliatory to each, surmised the speak-
er. He also foresaw a step-up in the
popular “give away” programs, ac-
companied by a cut-back in defense
spending. There is also the possibili-
ty of federal aid to education and
Grants-in-Aid to states.

Dr Nutter ended the lecture by re-
stating his belief that there was “no
coherent philosophy” in he current
President's national economic policy.
The implications of this broad trend,
said Nutter, could be disastrous for
the nation. A lively question and an-
swer period followed the lecture.

Boatwright Directs
Christmas Reading
At R. E. Lee Church

On December 13, at 8 o’clock p.m.,
the R. E. Lee Memorial Episcopal
Church will present a reading of
W. H. Auden’s For the Time Being:
A Christmas Oratorio.

James Boatwright, II, professor of
English and narrator of the work,
said: “The Oratorio is a dramatic
poem, interspersed with prose, for
several voices. The traditional char-
ters of the Christmas Story speak—
Mary, Joseph, the Wise Men, the
Shepherds, Herod. There are com-
mentary choruses as well.”

In all there are fourteen partici-
pants. They are drawn from the
W&L faculty and student body, from
the VMI faculty and from the towns-
people.

Mary is played by Mrs. George
Ray, Joseph by Professor Severn
Duvall, and Gabriel by Starke Syd-
nor. The chorus includes the Rev-
erend Mister J. Thompson Brown,
Professor L. R. Emmons, Professor
Brewster Ford, Mrs. William Sauder,
Gerald Coffman, Lockhart Hardley,
Mike Marcoux, Steve Millard, Mal-
colm Morris, and Jo Tartt.

The Oratorio was composed by
Auden during 1941-1942. Ie has been
performed by many church groups
and parts have been set to music.
The production here will be without
music.

Coordinators Report to EC

Positions Open For
68 Mock Convention

By FRANK FAIRCHILD, JR.

Newly-appointed Mock Conven-
tion Interim Co-Ordinators, Dave
Mayfield and Steve Saunders, pre-
sented their plans at the Executive
Committee meeting last night. After
establishing a Convention office,
they hope to correlate records of
past Conventions and to examine
sources of possible income.

The co-ordinators plan to insti-
tute an Advisory Board for the 1968
Mock Convention, consisting of
notable Republican leaders. It is
hoped the Board will include Gen-
eral Eisenhower, former Vice-Pres-
ident Nixon, ,Senator Goldwater,
Gov. Rockefeller, Ambassador Lodge
and ex-Gov. Dewey Other Party
leaders being invited are Gov. Seran-
ton, Congresaman Miller, Senator
Dirkson and the Republican Nation-
al Chairman (whoever that may be).
Aside from serving in an advisory
eapacity, the Board will lend new
prestige to the Convention.

Mayfield and Saunders plan to ap-
point a sophomore financial chair-

man, eight freshman regional man-

agers and two personal assistants.
Explaining the function of the reg-
ional managers, Steve Saunders
commented: “There are sixteen
executive committeemen on the Re-
publican National Committee. The
fifty states are divided up fer cam-
paign planning purposes among six-
teen committee members We are as-

Daily Worship
Periods Planned
For Lee Chapel

Dean Sprunt Announces
Tours To Be Discontinued
During Meditation Period

Historic Lee Chapel, where
Robert E. Lee attended daily
services when president of the
University, will again figure in
the spiritual life of students at
the university.

Beginning Sunday, December 6, a
15-minute period wil lbe set aside
daily except Sunday for meditation
or prayer by students, faculty, and
the public.

Tours through the chapel by vis-
itors will be discontinued during the
meditation period, but visitors will
be welcome to participate if they
wish, ,according to Dr. David W.
Sprunt, university chaplain.

Monday through Friday the medi-
tation period will be from 1:45 to
2:00 p.m. and on Sunday from 5 to

 

5:15 p.m., Dr. Sprunt said.

Richard V. Johnson, a freshman
from Chesapeake, Va., will play
sacred music at the chapel’s Erben
organ during the meditation period.

Lee Chapel was constructed in
1867 under the supervision of Gen-
eral Lee who attended daily wor-
ship servies there during his presi-
dency of Washington College from
1865 to his death in 1870. A small
plaque marks the pew where Lee
sat during these services. After his
death daily chapel services were dis-
continued, but voluntary regular
programs have been revived from
time to time for short periods.

Dr. Sprunt said the present plan
makes worship or meditation at the
chapel a voluntary, individual mat-
ter. He said that formal regular serv-
ices and vespers had been generally
unsuccessful.

“It was felt that the university has
a spiritual obligations to make some
use of the Lee Chapel for the pur-
pose for which it was built,” said
Dr. Sprunt.

Lee Chapel is a registered national
historic landmark which contains
the tomb of Robert E. Lee and his
family, the office Lee occupied when
president of the college, ,an,d a mu-
seum of Lee memorabilia, Over
40,000 visitors pass through the
Chapel annually.

 

 

glad to receive assistance from any
student who feels that he can be
of help with a particular region.
Applications for these positions are
currently being received.

One of the immediate programs
which will be undertaken by the in-
terim staff is a study of the tax stat-
us of the Mock Convention. In an at-

outlook for attaining the $800 goal

By MIKE HASH
News Editor

The Executive Committee an-
nounced last night the appointment
of two student representatives to
the University Committee on Ath-
letecs. Tom Crenshaw, Delt Senior,
and Butch West, Delt senior, were
chosen from nine applicants at the
weekly meeting of the EC.

The University Committee on In-
tercollegiate Athletics is composed
of five members of the Faculty chos-

lowing specific functions: to assist
the Administration in the selection
of a director of athletics and ath-
letic coaches; to approve the
scheduling of all contests; to pre-
pare and submit for the approval
of the Board of Trustees a bud-
get for operation of intercollegiate
athletics; and to consider and pass
on the applications of students to
represent the University in all
branches of sport.

the convention interim program to
the EC for approval.

 

Coat & Tie Tradition
To Face Opinion Vote

By DON

O’HARE

Assistant News Editor
A student body referendum on conventional dress
and the Assimilation Committee will be held tomorrow, be-
tween the hours of 8:15 a.m. and 2 p.m. in Washington Hall.
The referendum, brought about by a student petition, is aimed
at giving students at Washington and Lee a chance to express
their views on the tradition of conventional dress dress and

 

Debaters Continue
hyo Season
In Pitts urgh Meet

By DAVE MARCHESE

Last weekend the Washington and
Lee debate team won seven out of
ten debate rounds in a tournament
at the University of Pittsburgh at

|| Pittsburgh, Pa. Such schools as Col-
| gate, Navy,

George Washington,
Miami (O.), and Maryland were
represented, and along with others,
made a total of 42 schools and 164
debaters competing for tournament
honors.

Debating the negative for Wash-
ington and Lee were Ed Fitzgerald
in his first tournament of the 1964-
1965 season, and freshman Kaz Her-
chold. Together they compiled a
tournament record of four wins to
one defeat, while the affirmative
team of John McMurray and Rick
Kneipper won three our of five
rounds. This performance marks the
12th straight tournament over a
three year span without a losing ree-
ord for McMurray, and the same
for Kneipper in six tournaments
over a four year period.

Of special interest was the fact
that the tournament included the
cross-examination form of debating.
In “cross-x,” as it is called, each
debater must not only present his
main speech and rebuttal, but must
also be prepared to answer direct
questions from the opposing team,
as well as be well versed in the
most penetrating questions he can
put to his opponents. This calls for
a thorough knowledge of the debate
topic.

This weekend the debate team
will be on the road again, this time
traveling to Wake Forest College
to take part in the Dixie-Classic,

where they will find themselves

confronted with a continuation of

the very stiff and experienced com-

petition which they have encounter-
ed the past three weekends. Work-
horse John McMurray and fresh-
men Jeff Wainscott, Tom Baremore,
and Hal Higginbotham, will be rep-
resenting Washington and Lee along
with successful debate coach Profes-
sor William W. Chaffin.

Probations for Academics Asked

By DAVE MARCHESE
IFC Columnist

Last night's meeting of the IFC
concentrated on a discussion of the
topics which were discussed at the
IFC Banquet earlier this year. The
idea behind this series of discussions
is an attempt to solve some of the
pressing and not-so-pressing prob-
lems that were deemed worthy of
discussion

While there were hardly any re-
actions to the first questions thrown
out to the representatives Ht took

Students will be asked to make
one of the following choices: 1) I
agree with the tradition of conven-
tional dress and the Assimilation
Committee as it stands now. 2) I
agree with the tradition of conven-
tional dress and the Assimilation
Committee, but I believe that there
should be some change in the pres-
ent operation of the committee.
(Write in exact changes in policy
that you would suggest as to what
is to be considered conventional
dress.) 3) I believe in the tradition
of conventional dress, but I do not
think it should be administered by
an assimilation committee. 4) I do
not believe in the tradition of con-
ventional dress.

No Immediate Effect

The result of the referendum,
although there can be no immediate
concrete effect on our present sys-
tem, will, if conslusive enough, start
the wheels of an amendment rolling.
The results will be made known
through the Ring-tum Phi sometime
before Christmas vacation.

Jim Kulp, student body president,
expressed the hope that students
would see fit to back the Assimila-
tion Committee in supporting the
tradition of conventional dress. Jim
complimented the committee for the
fine job that it has done this year.
He fells that “the committee is need-
ed to assimilate students, freshmen
in particular, to all the traditions
of the university, and to point out
the importance and benefits of these
traditions.”

Kulp also commented that at the
present time it would be impossible
to have the conventional dress tra-
dition without enforcement, a pro-
gram that has been proven inef-
fective on many campuses.

Brooks Brown

The Assimilation Committee, un-
der the chairmanship of Brooks
Brown, is “looking forward” to the
results of the referendum. The com-
mittee will study these results and
take steps which reflect the opinion
of the student body as a whole. It
is the expressed hope of both brown
and Kulp that each student will
give the referendum serious thought
before making a decision.

“We should not be influenced by
momentary whims,” said Kulp, “The
tradition of wearing a coat and tie
on campus has ben a long estab-
lished one which not only adds to
the appearance of our university, but
helps us in our goal to become true
Washington and Lee gentlemen.”

Could Still Function
If a majority of students vote to
free conventionai dress from the jur-
isdiction of the Assimilation Com-
mittee, the body could still exist

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Assimilation Committee Referendum

Conventional dress is not one of the things which
make Washington and Lee a great school. Even if the
tradition were to die, Washington and Lee would be es-
sentially unaffected. And so the furor over tomorrow’s
referendum, which cannot even abolish the Assimilation
Committee, much less vote out conventional dress, may
be somewhat exaggerated—particularly when seen in the
light of the quiet decay of the speaking tradition. The
speaking tradition, which is perhaps at a more advanced
state of decay than the coat and tie tradition, is also an ex-
ternal; yet it is a more genuine and a more effective one
than conventional dress.

Nevertheless, tomorrow’s referendum will be an im-
portant one, and perhaps a crucial point in the tradition
of conventional dress. If it is not an essential, conventional
dress is still one of the most attractive aspects of Wash-
ington and Lee and also of the elusive “Washington and
Lee gentleman.” The coat and tie give campus life, and
this includes classes in particular, a pleasant atmosphere.
Unquestionably conventional dress is favored by a huge
majority of students and faculty.

Ideally there should be no need for enforcement of
conventional dress, but evidently—a glance over the cam-
pus at any given time will prove—if W&L is to have
conventional dress, it had best be enforced. Since a tre-
mendous proportion of students wear a coat and tie, they
should not object to the Assimilation Committee be-
cause they should never even realize its existence. There-
fore—simply because the Assimilation Committee should
not offend those who never have to appear before it—
the Ring-tum Phi favors a standing Assimilation Com-
mittee. Such a committee, and only such a committee, can
enforce conventional dress by applying small penalties
to violators of the coat and tie tradition. Social pressure
cannot enforce conventional dress—as proved by U.Va.’s
experience—and neither can any loose machinery such
as cooperation between fraternity presidents.

The best choice, then, in tomorrow’s referendum, is
number two: a vote for an assimilation committee, but
with changes in its operation. The proposed change which
has received the most attention so far is to authorize
“wheat jeans” as conventional dress. Wheat jeans, how-
ever, are not a gentlemen’s attire and cannot be made
so by vote of a referendum, any more than could blue
jeans. To have the Assimilation Committee enforce wheat
jeans as conventional dress would be to reduce the com-
mittee to an absurdity; it would then be enforcing some-
thing as being “conventional” which cannot be called con-
ventional by any reasonable definition.

The change which is really needed in the Assimilation
Committee is more efficient administration. The commit-
tee ought to be able to avoid resentment and still be an
eficient enforcer of conventional dress, if it is adminis-
tered well. But the committee is hampered by demands
that its policies be explicity laid out for the student body.
Judicious administration should not be bound to a set of
rules, but should be at the discretion of the committee.
Thus the change to more definite policies, another often-
suggested change, would probably render the Assimila-
tion committee still more impotent to control violations
of conventional dress.

Number one on the referendum—the status quo—has
virtually no chance. Number four—"TI do not believe in
the tradition of conventional dress’—is also unlikely.
If number three—aimed at the abolition of the Assimi-
lation Committee—is the winner, the Executive Commit-
tee will be forced to call for a student body vote on
whether to free conventional dress from Committee en-
forcement by passage of a constitutional amendment. The
EC, though, would itself be unlikely to vote in favor of
the amendment, and so it would require a two-thirds ap-
proval from the student body. It is doubtful that the
amendment would receive this solid backing. So no mat-
ter what the results of tomorrow's referendum, not only
conventional dress, but also the Assimilation Committee
appear to be in no real danger.

Saturday Classes

The Friday Ring-tum Phi has based a request that Sat-
urday classes be abolished in the grounds that free Satur-
days would allow “uninterrupted research.” In actuality
the effect of abolishing Saturday classes would not be to
bring on additional research; the change would be in
allowing uninterrupted road trips. This would be a happy
change, to be sure, were it not for the disagreeable fact
that Saturday classes cannot really be abolished at all; they
would have to be shifted to other days. This would mean
more afternoon classes—which would interrupt not only
present research, but also labs, ROTC drill and class, and
sports activities. None of these latter activities are as neces-
sary at neighboring girls’ colleges, which are cited by the
Friday edition as examples of schools without Saturday
classes, as they are here.

The outstanding benefit of free Saturdays would un-
doubtedly be that professors would be able to do more

 

research than they can do now. They could use weekends
to travel to larger libraries for materials. However, the first
concern of the faculty is to teach students. If Saturday
classes are necessary for Se heduling of a full curricu
lum, and they seem to be, given W&L’s facilities and
faculty, then they must be retained, Still it would be inter-
esting to see the results of a full examination of the
curriculum, as proposed by the Friday edition, with an
eye to a possible shortening of the work week.

 

Lamb Explains ODK Refusal

 

Campus Critics, Agents of Change
Fail to Receive Recognition at W&L

by Lamar Lamb
Tuesday Columnist

My rejection of the honor given
me by ODK in last Friday’s assem-
bly has already
received far more
attention than I
expected and
more, I think, than
it deserves. Never-
theless, because of
the reasons for my
action, it is in-
cumbent upon me
to explain my
motives. There
are, I am sure,
those who are al-
ready sure they know the reasons
for my action. This column will be
of no interest to them. But it is my
hope that those who are curious
about my motives and those who are
interested in ODK leadership at
Wshington and Lee in general will
find food for thought in what I
have to say.

Simply, my rejection was lodged
as a protest against the method
and results of the selection of new
members to the “leadership fra-
ternity.” Since this year’s selec-
tions were secret up until the as-
sembly, it is obvious that I was
protesting action of past ODK
circles and not the prest one.
As far as this year is concerned,

I think the circle did a fairly good
job. I disagree with some selec-
tions and some omissions, but it
is obvious that full campus con-
sensus could never be reached in
such a matter.

The point at which I criticize
ODK, and at which I could never
join them, is one that has already
passed. It can never be rectified, but
I hope that members of ODK will
look to try to solve the problems in
structure and membership which
have caused errors in the past.

Since I have been at Washington
and Lee, I think I have seen changes
in the school—slow, inadequate
changes, but generally, changes for
the good. But ODK has consistently
failed to recognize the innovators
and critics who have been spokes-
men for, and agents of changes.
These are the people who deserve
the recognition for leadership at
least as much as past and present
members of ODK. It has become a
truism that criticism of the establish-
ed ways and leadership of Washing-
ton and Lee marks one as dangerous
or a misfit. Actually, several unrec-
ognized leaders of W&L have done
much more for this school than
veritable Dukes of Wellington who
have received honor for being
backward and petty.

Furthermore, there have been
and are members of ODK whose

 

Potential Republican JFK

 

principle characteristic is inoffen-
siveness and malleability rather
than intelligence and leadership.
Perhaps it can be argued that
that Washington and Lee is no
worse about this than any other
place. My optimistic nature, how-
ever, forced me to reject this
gloomy possibility. It is my opinion
that far too many of the so-called
leaders of this community are in
their positions because of what
they aren’t rather than what they
are. There have been members of
ODK who were members mrely
because they have adequately
served as superficial face men for
a corrupt power system.

My rejection, then, can also be
taken as a protest to a value sys-
tem which has allowed some of the
people who have been in leadership
positions to get there and which
has rejected some of the most impor-
tant people at Washington and Lee
as subversive or dangerous.

Any protest must be based on the
premise that things can get better.
And perhaps I can be rightly ac-
cused of being too idealistic in this
matter. But I acted in the belief that
things can get better at Washington
and Lee and in ODK. Whether this
is true or not, the fact remains
that ODK, at times in the past, has
not lived up to the goal it set for

John Lindsay: A GOP “Comer”

By STEVE SAUNDERS
Associate Editor

U.S. Representative John V. Lind-
say (R.-N.Y.) first achieved nation-
al prominence when he joined with
New York Senators Jacob K. Javits
and Kenneth B. Keating in refus-
ing to support the Republican na-
tional ticket in late July. But Lind-
say has long been prominent in
Empire State political thinking. A
story-book candidate with unrival-
ed aptitude for high public office,
he was marked as a “comer” from
the moment he was first elected to
Congress in 1958. In fact, he could

Payne Urges Votes For
Assimilation Committee

 

 

 

To the Editor:

An old political addage
priately proposes that, “A
ant without a sword is no
ant at all.”

Generally, this is applicable to the
referendum to decide the fate of the
Assimilation Committee.

Assuming that the conventional
dress and speaking traditions at
Washington and Lee exist with pur-
pose and merit, what is the most ef-
fective means of preserving them?

appro-
coven-
coven -

Perhaps those who advocate the
demise of the Assimilation Commit-
tee upon the contention that a
“tradition” is voluntary and needs no
exterior enforcing mechanism are
correct. However, it seems to me
they are only circumventing the
question. In essence, it is a matter
of what form the sword will take,
and in this specific interest it is
either a social pressure or a fear
of being orally and financially rerp-
remanded by the punitive edge of
the sword. It is the former rather
than the latter which is the most ef-
fective enforcing mechanism in con-
forming to social standardrs.

There is however a tendency to
emphasize only the punitive edge of
the sword and to negate the essence
of the power that is the Assimilation
Committee’s.

In deciding the future of this
committee, we must consider the
seldom exposed blade of the sword
of power. I speak of the assimila-
tive function of he committee,
since its merit and purpose lie not
in finding habitual violators, but in
developing the importance and
and consequences of our traditions,
and in effecting assimilation of
freshmen into this specific aspect
of University life.

Of necessit: because there are
those who violate the unwritten
rules of the past and present Wash-
ington and Lee society, there must
be a method to effectively remind
these individuals of the accepted

ndard. Bssentially, this is a min-
imal task for most students adhere
or attempt in a relative fashion to
adhere to the tandard—which I
might edd, is a reasonable expec-
tation of a man } yaring himself
for society in genera

To those who contend that this
eniorein mecnanism transgresses
individual libert id stifles intel-
lectual and phi | independence,
I con only y that their contention
s basically unteneable and unrealis-
tic

In every seciety there are cer-
tain “accepted traditions” which
really have ne position in contro-
versy. To conform to certain basic
regulations, expressed or implied
is merely to pay the price for the
living in that society. Only when
the price becomes too high is there
ground for controversy.

A man whose liberty and individ-
ualism are stifled by wearing a tie
or by speaking to another has only
token liberty and individualism ob-
structed, and has little else to occu-
py either or both

The only I can find
with the Assimilation Committee is

serious fault

that the assimilative functions in a

Grapplers Down U N r For Second Victory

 

Final Freestyle Relay Win
Gives Generals Ist Victory

By SKIP CHASE
Tuesday Sports Writer

Washington and Lee swimmers managed a major upset
over their subsidized opponent Catholic University by a score
of 50 to 45 in the Generals’ season opener last Saturday.

Competing against scholarship athletes, Wé&L swimmers
pleased a small but enthusiastic crowd by coming from behind
twice and winning the squeaker with a victory in the final relay

 

 

Previously unbeaten, Catholic¥
University captured the opening! qus take a crucial first in the 200-
medley relay in decisive fashion. yard backstroke followed by fresh-

W&L was put right back in the
meet on the next event as Bill
Wildrick edged his opponent for
first and freshman New Lawrence
grabbel a valuable third.

Lead Gained and Lost

Catholic rebounded with a first in
the 50-yard freestyle but Skip Chase
and Bart Taylor placed second and
third respectively yielding only one
point. The following event, the 200-
yard individual medley brought
competitors and fans alike to their
feet as Tom Edwards and George
Bokinsky touched out their Catho-
lic opponent for a first and second
respectively in what was a “photo
finish.”

Now in the lead 18-16, the Gen-
erals under coach Norris Eastman
sensed victory and watched with
rising expectations as freshmen Tom
Clinnard and Rich Stevens swept
the diving to give W&L a nine point
buldge. Sensing defeat Catholic
roared back sweeping both the 200-
yard butterfly and the 100-yard
freestyle to regain the lead, 33-28.

Final Event Decisive

Determined to turn the trick, the

Gen nerals watched co-c aptain Broad-

 

man John Baker who grabbed a
third. With the gap sliced 34-36,
Lawrence and Wildrick stuck close
together and placed second and
third in the 500-yard freestyle.

Now three points behind, fresh-
man Kester Denman took a decisive
first cutting the margin to two
points and leaving the meet hinging
on the final event, the 400-yard free-
style relay. In the midst of church-
like silence the starter fired his gun
and pandamonium filled the south
wing of Doremus Gymnasium.

Freshman Edwardrs grabbed a
slim lead which he gave to Chase
who gave it to Bokinsky who gave it
to anchor man Taylor who held it
and thereby gave W&L its sweetest
and most surprising win in many
seasons.

 

NOTICE

It was announced today that four
erals were selected to the All-Vir-
members of the W&L football Gen-
ginia football squad. Bill David and
Joe Miller were selected to the first
team and Jeff Novinger and Starke
Sydnor received honorable mention.

“Disappointed but not discour-

W&L basketball mentor Verne Can-
field after his charges lost two
high scoring contests over the week-
end. Friday and Saturday the Gen-
erals journeyed to Old Dominion and
Hampden-Sydney for their first
two regular season games.

Coach Canfield explained that the
W&L players “never quit” while
somewhat outmanned by a strong

score does not reveal the real story
of the contest, he continued, while
the Hampden-Sydney win (118-86)
shows that win or lose, W&L fans
are going to see action this year
from their basketball team.”
Tonight following the freshman
prelim (which begins at 7 p.m.) the
Generals will meet Bridgewater Col-
lege in their first home game of
the year. The pep band will be pres-
ent and Coach Canfield promises that
W&L is “up” for this game, and he

students to come out and support

 

their team.

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Columnist

A high school football coach with
whom I am acquainted once said,
“It’s not how you play the game,
but whether you win or lose.” This
statement appears to cummarize the
philosophy of the average parrtici-
pant in the intramural athletics at
Washington and Lee. This general
procedure of ignoring rules as much
as possible seems to be caused by
personal candidates and a lack of
competent officials.

The football field is an excellent!

place for one to sneak in a few |

elbows under the chin of one of his
arch enemies. This usually causes
even greater animosity between the
two antagonists, and the fight be-
gins. At this time fraternity broth-
erhood comes to the front and every-
one rushes to the defense of his
brother, leading to the equivalent of
a gang war.

And where are the referees? Cas-

This is not the only place in
which intramural officials fall below
acceptable standards. Some seem to
know less about the rules than the
players do. Some players ignore
more rules than the officials are
aware exist. Some officials appear
basically prejudiced. Some officials
are mere on the scene in order to
collect a $2 pay check. Some seem to
have no idea why they are officiat-
ing; others don’t officiate.

referees are complete incompetents.

Pins by Dick Musick, Kemble White and Warren Stewart
last night led Washington and Lee to its second wrestling vic-
tory in as many matches. After trouncing Virginia Professional
Institute, 40-0, last Thursday, the Generals feared a tougher

match with UNC but were able to handle the Tar Heels
easily, 23-10.

In the initial individual contest
of the evening Butch West started
W&L by decisioning his opponent,
5-3, before Musick pinned his 130
pound man early in the second
period. White followed this with his
pin with only 13 seconds left in his _
match to give the Generals a 13-0 ,
lead.

ran against Javits for the Senate
in 1956, Javits piled up a neat ma-

unseat Wagner, but he has himself
stated that Lindsay must be consid-
ered a potential candidate.

If Lindsay runs for Mayor and
wins, he will be one of the most
powerful Republicans in the nation,
if not the single most powerful. In
that position he could ride the tide
of his popularity to the '68 National
Convention. If he ran and lost, he
could still run for Governor in 1966
and have a fair chance of winning:
New Yorkers have an infamously

I hope ODK will seek to establish
more objective standards of selec-

of the pettiness that has entered
into past selections. And most im-
portant, I hope that ODK will take
to heart the words of the man who
spoke in its assembly, that there is
no leadership where there is not
effective, responsible criticism.

Chances are that Rockfeller will
forego a third four-year term in 1966
to make way for Lindsay. If Lind-
say is elected Governor, he will be
in an ideal position for the Presi-
dential nomination two years after-
ward.

Even if these things do not come

A by O. E. SCHOEFFLER,
ESQUIRE’S Fashion Director

Now it’s tame to make the suiting seene—and we've got news for
you! Not as far as styling’s concerned—your natural shoulder suit
with its plain, pleatless trousers is very much among those present!
But if you’ve a new suit on your agenda, ‘“‘The Three B’s”’ are
well worth investigating. They’re thrée new suitings you'll be
seeing on and off campus — Brigade Twill, Basketweave and
herring’Bone. Let’s take an in-depth look at them.

THE LIGHT BRIGADE RIDES AGAIN

in light, natural tones of Brigade and
Cavalry Twill. These hard-wearing,
smooth-finish fabrics can take an amaz-
ing amount of punishment without losing
their shape. You’ll find them in erisply
tailored traditional suits, many with wide
welt seaming as an added refinement.

BANK ON BASKETWEAVE, « abr

newly revived for suits, sport jackets and
slacks. It’s a somewhat smaller, tighter
version than before, with a fine-grained
‘*look of the hopsack.’’ Camel color comes
on strong in Basketweaves, as do muted
heather mixtures.

BONES ARE THE BACKBONE of the col-

    
  

lege man’s wardrobe — a favorite and
fashion-wise choice. The small, classi¢
herringbone weave is particularly popu-
lar_in black-and-white or black-and-gray
combinations, but don’t overlook the
more unusual ’Bones—in blue, perhaps,
with a touch of green.

THE BOLDER THE BETTER is the an-

swer, when it’s a question of accessories!
Stronger, more colorful stripes and checks
identify this season’s shirts. The range
runs from a conservative choice like wide
gray and tan striping on white oxford to
narrow, bright-red stripes for more ad-
venturous types — and checks run the
gamut from pinchecks to ginghams to
Tattersalls. Even the perennial oxford
shirting gains new power by combining
two and three colors in the weave, as do
the newer twill and herringbone weaves.

.. AND BOLDER AND BOLDER. In ties,

regimentals and diagonal stripes are
brighter, broader and spaced farther
apart. Figures on foulard and challis
ties are classic in design — but they’re
bigger, brighter—bolder! Even belts take
on ‘* The Bold Look,’’ with big, burnished
brass buckles on highly polished leather.

HIGH RISERS RISE TO THE OCCASION — which can mean any

oceasion that doesn't call for white wool sweat socks! Certainly
these over-the-calf socks belong with a suit—their sleek good looks
insure the trim appearance that complements tailored apparel,
and there's no unseemly exposure of hairy shin when you sit down!
Solid colors in dark shades coordinated to your suit ean be found
in rib-knit cotton and polyester blends.

THE WING-AROUND GETS AROUND

—and so will you, in this new shoe with a
wing-tip that doesn't know when to quit!
Instead of going to ground at the instep,
it ‘‘wings’’ clear around the body of the
shoe for a streamlined look, balanced by
a hefty-looking extended sole. The
**Wing-Around”’ comes in black and the
newer dark brown ranges that blend with
your suits.

THE NEW SLANT IN HATS is well to the fore—the center-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

| creased crown is higher in the back and slopes forward. Slightly
| more moderate proportions mark the snap-brims of these new hats

—no more of those bantam brims, please! Gray and bronze-tone
felts will fit nicely into your suiting color schemes, with medium-
width bands in darker tones.

That should do it for the dressier occasions you'll face this Fall.
Next time, we'll fill you in on outerwear, so that the wintry
weather won't find you out in the cold! See you then!
