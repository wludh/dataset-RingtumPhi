Troubadours To Present O’Neill’s
“Long Day’s Journey Into Night”

The Troubadour Theater's
and final production of the
Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Jour-
ney inte Night, will open on Wed-
nesday, May 5th and run through
Saturday, May 8th.

Long Day's Journey into Night
was written in 1940, but never pro-
duced until after the author's death
in 1956. O'Neill would not allow the
production during his lifetime be-
cause it is a strangely biographical
play. It deals with many incidents
from his own life young man
and the misery of his family.

Plans were finalized last eve-
ning by the Executive Com-
mittee for the presentation of a
Mock Honor Trial. The trial
is tentatively set for May 5 in

Lee Chapel at 7 p.m. Attend-
ance will be voluntary although all
freshmen are particularly urged to
attend in order to complete their
orientation program.

A subcommittee under the direc-
tion of Jim DeYoung composed the
script which incorporates all the ele-
ments of an actual trial situation.
The EC decided to withhold the na-
ture of the verdict in an effort to
lend a certain amount of credence to
performance of the trial.

The parts of the witnesses and de-
fendant will be played by former
members of the EC while the pres-
ent BC will constitute the Honor
Court in this fabricated incident. A
rehearsal of the trial has been sched-
uled for next week at which time
the entire production will be re-
viewed by the Committee.

Overcut Problem

Malcolm Morris, chairman of a
subcommittee dealing with the over-

}cut problem, reported that his com-

mittee plans to offer several alter-
natives to the Self Study Committee
in the area of punishment for an
overcut.

Some of the suggestions which
will be put before this faculty com-
mittee include the following: A re-
duction in credits (both quantity and
quality) for an unexeused overcut,
or possibly a reduction in the stu-
dents grades (not to fall below D).
In adidtion, some restrictions on the
student's cuts for the next semester
or even increased assignments in the
particular course could serve as an
adequate disciplinary measure.

In the case of semester seniors
Morris proposed that all students in
this category who have a graduating
average be given three weeks of
cuts. Morris felt that this would ef-
fectively eliminate the problem of
overcutting by second semester sen-
iors.

Class Elections

In other action the EC set Mon-

day, May 3 as the date for class
elections. The location of class meet-
ings will be announced at a later

A Spot of Enthusiasm

The outstanding performance of the W&L debate team

at Randolph-Macon College a

t Ashland last weekend again

brings attention to a group which has deserved attention all

year long. In a tournament which attracted the best schools
from Virginia and the surrounding area, Washington and Lee
debaters swept the majority of the honors. So far this year
the debate team has accumulated ten trophies—despite the fact
that most of the debating has been done by freshmen.

This year was supposed to be a building year for the de-
bate program, and so “participation” was stressed even more
than usual, and a large number of freshmen in particular were
used in major tournaments. Working without any kind of
academic credit, the novices put in enough time at debating to
be able to compete on a level with experienced college debat-
ers in most meets.

Certainly debating is one area where W&L’s notorious
“apathy” has not struck. It is real enthusiasm for debating
which has made Washington and Lee’s debate program prob-
ably the best in the state and definitely one of the top in the
east. And that debating is a valuable experience is proven by
the fact that in each of the last four years one of three student
body officers on the E. C. has been a man with extensive de-
bating experience. It is, moreover, noteworthy that through its
debating exploits the name of the school is published exten-
sively. Congratulations are in order to the debate team this
year; either next year or the next, it is not unlikely that the
present freshmen debaters will reach the national champion-
ships and repeat the achievements of Bill Noell and Al Eckes

Saunders Analyzes “Big Four” Election Returns

 

Party Strength Defeated Reform Proposals

By STEVE SAUNDERS
Associate Editor

A easual look at the returns from
any political race indicates merely
that one man lost and another won.
But a closer perusal of the available
figures can reveal a great deal about
what happened, what will happen,
and — more importantly — why.

Lower Turnout

Only 1067 students voted last
Thursday out of a total enrollment
of approximately 1250. This com-
prises 84% of the Student Body. Last
year, 98% of the Student Body voted;
1126 voting out of a student body of
approximately 1150. Clearly, not as
much interest was generated during
the 65 campaign as there was last
year.

The campaign of themselves were
not in any way easy-going. In both
the Mindel-Walker and Marchese-
Lee races the campaigning was brisk.
Forensic Union and Independent Un-
ion speeches added color. But it was
a pivotal point in W&L political an-
nals, because straight party voting
broke down and split tickets carried
the day. This splitting resulted in
Mindel’s victory.

The presidential contest drew more
voter attention than the other races.
Out of 1067 voting in the presidential
race, nine did not vote for a vice-
president; thirty-four did not vote
for secretary, and one hundred seven
(107) did not vote for Fancy Dress
President.

Constitutional amendments. did

 

two years ago.

 

attract voters with 1043 voting on

the EC Reapportionment Amendment
(Number I) and 1021 voting on the
Political Reform Amendment (Num-
ber II).

Low, or lower, turnouts can usual-
ly be ascribed in contemporary Am-
erican politics to a variety of
causes: rain (the farmers stay home),
cold (the city people stay home),
snow (everybody stays home), a poor
campaign (the candidate stays home),
or poor newspaper and media cover-
age (nobody knows there’s an elec-
tion).

Tired of Politics

However, W&L votes few farmers,
no city dwellers, had no snow on
April 15, and enjoyed extensive cov-
erage of the campaign in the Ring-
tum Phi. But still the interest was
lacking. Many students were tired
of politics, tired of party switches,
weary of clique talk, annoyed by the
noise of candidates. And so 26% of
them — one hundred twenty-four —
stayed home.

Miller Successful

Joe Miller, successful candidate for
Fancy Dress President, was in an
especially difficult situation; he was
unopposed. This may be hard for
anyone not in a like circumstance to
understand.

Miller had to present a campaign,
and act like a candidate. However,
in a nation where the essence of
elections is contrast, and appeal on
the basis of opposition (for there is
a great deal to be said for negativ-
ism in a campaign), Miller had no-
body with whom to contrast and

 

Overcut Penalty Absurd

Cut System Is Called

 

By BIFF BARKER

Nestled in the Shenandoah Valley,
Washington and Lee has retained a

number of quaint
) old customs. Take
| our cut system, for
) example.

There was a time
when W&L was a
* school for rich
 , Southern playboys
_ Parents sent their
children there to
get a good educa-
tion, but also to
have a good time.
It didn’t really
matter how much hell they raised
juts so long as they got those gen-
tleman “C's”, Perhaps then it made
sense to require students to go to

  
 

last year’s entering class at Williams
and Pomona, according to the Hand-
book of College Profiles.

For better or for worse, the W&L
man today is of a more intellectual,
more serious breed. To burden him
with regulations which applied to a
far different type of person one or
two generations ago is insulting.

It is insulting that the W&L man
who measures up to today’s high
standards should be considered too
irresponsible, too incapable to handle
his own education. We have come to
one of the finest universities in the
South, and yet we are treated as if
we were in high school.

Some people have attacked out cut
system. They think it should be
liberalized. They thinks the “F”
|penalty for overcutting is too strict.

 

“Quaint Old Custom”

|that a majority of the student body

cuts, or worse yet, because he can't
let all those good unused cuts go to
waste. Is this a mature outlook? Is
this the kind of man Washington and
Lee wants to develop? That is why
the cut system must go. This
“hooky” complex must be overcome.

But let’s be realistic for a minute.
What would happen if the cut sys-
tem were abolished? It is possible
that the place would go wild. Per-
haps it would be Goshen every day,
and the camps would eb on ehuge
tomb—for a week or two.

A few years back an experiment
was run. Second semester seniors
were given unlimited cuts. The re-
sults were not exactly encouraging.
Naturally the seniors acted like chil-
dren let loose in a pastry shop! They
had been treated like children for
three and a half years!

would be able to accept the awesome
burden of unlimited responsibility
without evacuating Lexington in the
first place.

Like most needed reforms which

too long have been prolonged, there
is a risk that change might bring

nothing to oppose.

The Students appreciated Miller's
concern for their votes — even
though he was unopposed — and so
gave them to him. Miller polled 748
votes. He needed only 480 to win.
“Fritz” received 212 votes.

Party Defeats Reform

It seems strange that the Political
Reform proposal, which received 68%
of the 500 votes cast a few weeks
ago, failed again on Thursday with
only 52% of the 1021 votes cast. It
is hard to believe that a proposal
favored by a majority of the stu-
dents who originally voted on it could
spontaneously excite opposition to
the tune of 483 “No” votes within
three weeks.

No student leader publicly opposed
it; no candidate publicly attacked it;
no faction was in loud opposition.
But nonetheless it was defeated by a
quick but effective campaign by
those who did not want to see the
amendment pass.

The responsibility cannot be logi-
cally pinned on anyone, but is an in-
dication of latent strength from some
corner.

Popular speculation has it that the
University Party is “washed up”, or
“breaking up”. The loss of the presi-
dency of the Student Body seems a
catastrophic blow. However, the
party will still be a force with which
to reckon. ;

Although the credit, or blame, for
the Political Reform Amendment's
defeat cannot be assigned to the
Party on the basis of the vote totals,
it may be assumed — purely sub-
jectively — that it was the influence
and holding power of the University
Party. This power is potent, and if
it held for the voting on amend-
ments it might hold on the faceless
voting for class officers.

Method of Victory

Mindel beat Walker on the basis
of dynamic personal appeal. The
party lost the claim it had on the
loyalties of its member houses be-
cause of the strength of this appeal.
Marchese defeated Lee more on is-
sues — that of modification of the
Honor System — than on personal
appeal; witness Lee’s 502 votes to

years of finishing school; it is a so-

students don't just come to W&L

Washington and Lee has new pulled
itself out of the depths of darkness in
which is has been engulfed for sev-
eral generations,

This time it was the student body,
not the administration, which tock the
areatest step forward on campus since
the removal of Traveller's bones from
Lee Chapel. The New Guard has tri-

umphed!

I have heard cries of self-appoint -
ed rebel leaders that victory is
theirs; the elections proved that
Washington and Lee can now pro-
gress. | have also heard suggestions
that Lee College be built and the
New Guard be sent there, A very
interesting proposal, | must admit,

But te these whe try to understand
what happened on campus, the situa-
tion is a little bit different, First, just
what did happen during the elections
and second, what does it mean?

The oniy thing that one ean safely
say about the election is that it was
unorthodex. Anything else would be
pure guess work, Those whe say that
the election proved that the old guard
ia through are wrong. If this i true,

what about the two other party can-
didates who were elected in contested
races (omitting good old Fritz.)

The election was not a mandate

the conception of an entirely new,

radical point of view no more than

it was a triumph of good over evil,

The primary concern of the election,
omitting the personalities involved and
the big protest that was supposed to
be an issue, was the honor system. The
party candidate for president spoke
earnestly for maintaining the honor
system as it now stands

The independent candidate for pres-
ident also spoke in favor of the honor
system as it now stands, but murmur-
ings of suspicision were heard on
eampus that he was saying this be-
cause the majority of the students
were in favor of the system as it now
stands.

As | understand it the president-
elect does favor the system as it now
stands. He has spoken fer upholding
both the procedures and the penalties
now in effect and I personally believe
he is sincere in this belief. But, to
these who feel that the election should
mean a change in this system, I sug-
gest that they consider the situation
further

First, the honor system has work-

 

for an end to all traditions nor for |

| ed It has worked in the past and is
are reading this column, Without at-

| tions en campus,

exactly what

| “...@ gentleman does not lie, cheat,

| or steal,”

| He was sincere in his belief and he

| was not about to compromise about
honer.

Surely he did not believe that his
statement eliminated dishonor on cam-
pus. I am certain he realized that
cheating would probably oceur; but if
the Honor System kept one person
from being dishonest who normally
would have been, it was a success

But. what of the penalty? Is it
“right” for a person's life to be
“ruined” because of one moment's in-
discretion’ But, can it actually be clas-
sified as “one moment's indiscretion?”
A person lies, cheats, or steals... he
either does or he doesn't, If he does he
is not wanted as a student at Wash-
ington and Lee. He can go elsewhere
if he wishes, and I suggest this.

There have been several students
who have left this school, and other
schools, on an honor violation, and
have heen able to continue their edu

Greeks, the Ro-
mans, the He-
brows, and even
the _ barbarians,
plus all “history” since then, is wes-
tern and white.

How curious! The Africans, the In-
dians in America, the Indians in In-
dia, and other peoples have for cen-
turies been regarded by us as
strange, fringe sorts of creature, en-
countered by us and used by us as
our western civilization spread.

And we have always won. When
has a sizeable group of Caucasians
been long subjected to Negroid or
Mongoloid peoples?

There are three great traditions in
our heritage: The Greek, from which
we still have the notion of arete or
individual excellence; the Roman,
whence we derive our ideas of or-
der and harmony in the state; and
the Judaeo-Christian, which gives us
concepts for the dealing with other
persons in a group.

The first of these shows the self in
relation to itself: what is a man as
an individual and what should he do
as such’ The position of the self,
what it means to be an individual
was explicated for us here recently
by George Sehrader, Yale Professor
of Philosophy, in his talk “The Exis-
tential Image of Man.”

Yet to be fully a man, one must
see himself not only in relation to
his self, alone and isolated from
others and the world—but also in
relation to other persons and to the
social natural world. Now our ideas
of law and of the relationship be-
tween man and the state derive from
our Roman heritage. And from our
Christian tradition, we have the no-
tion of love for our fellow men: a
self relating in a meaningful and sla |
nifleant way with others, not as mass
men, but as particular persons, with-
in a social order

if these notions are seen distinctly,
and clearly and in proper perspec-
tive, one can here find a set of
theories to answer the philosophical
questions it has been the custom of
each of us to answer in our tradi-
tion since the Greeks: who am I?
what am I doing here? how should
I go about living my life?

Yet there are many strange and
powerful forces at work within our
tradition which threaten it, and
thereby everything we hold dear.
Some of the threats, | think, come
from an extreme emphasis on a par-
ticular aspect of our tradition.

For instance, extreme individual-
ism in a variety of forms, if it causes
the individual to isolate himself en-
tirely from his social order, can
bring about the dissolution of our
social institutions—and thereby of the
framework in which a person can
come to individual maturity.

On the other hand, the extreme
;of power concentration in the state,
with a corresponding imposing of
burdensome and fettering regulations
upon persons, could so hamper and
cramp individual growth, by remov-
ing the freedom necessary for it
(which necessarily includes the free-
dom to make mistakes and abandon
society), that the state could destroy
its own basis—namely, free, intelli-
gent, active persons dedicated to
maintain freedom for themselves and
their children through a functioning
social order

 

The problem is, can we keep these
extremes alive, not as separate and!
antagonistic parts of our society, but!
as existing strongly and with a dy-|

Kirkley

Frampton won on _ his personal
popularity, which is considerable, It
was virtually impossible for rival
candidate Neely Young to drag in
issues, try though he might. The
party’s strength was manifest, there-
fore, in no area but the Reform

Amendment. And there it was sur-
prising.
Influence Waning
Whether the party will last

through another election or even be
able to nominate class officers with-
out splitting, is somewhat doubtful
on the basis of the student body
elections. If the party members will
not support their nominees, the party
is in trouble. Party affiliation and
endorsement has increasingly become
more of a liability than an asset.
Those nominated by the party for
class office will have to run personal
and highly individual campaigns to
garner much-needed votes from
members of independent houses.
Party nominees, except in unusual
cases, will go into elections with two
strikes against them: massive defec-
tions in the party and an aroused
discontent outside of it.

The party will not disappear, but
its influence on students is waning.
Not one of the candidates presented
on April 15 won because of his party
backing, or lack of it. A new “gen-
eration” of W&L students is growing
up without having the party as the
ultimate in political life. The party
must face this, and reform from
within, or face ruin from without.

What's Next?

Defeated candidates for high of-
fice generally make splendid and
successful candidates for lower of-
fice — IF they were not defeated
too badly. By this standard, Bob
Lee will be a shoo-in for senior class
office, possibly one of the two EC
positions. Chuck Walker, by an-
other standard, seems likely to be
elected senior EC when the Party
nominates him — and they must
nominaté him if only to salvage
something from last Thursday setl
back. This turn of events will upset
many would-be candidates in the
party who now will be frozen out of
at least one of the Senior Class
nominations.

namic tension within each of us, so
that we will not tolerate a state that
demands from us that we give up
our personal identity, while at the
same time we will devote part of our
energies to the maintenance of a
state in which free individuals can
flourish—grow, develop, and express
themselves.

But—what of the relationship of
our white western culture, faced thus
with its own internal problems, in
relation to the rest of the world? The
Negroid race has never been a threat,
and is now being absorbed into our
tradition.

But what of the Mongeloid race?
Does not this constitute one-half to
two-thirds of the world’s population?
And whe among us understands their
culture and history and ways of
thinking?

Russia belongs in our own tradi-
tion—and represents one extreme of
it. But what of China? Is there
anything in their culture and tradi-
tion which is compatible with ours?
Is there a basis for reconciliation?

And is it not contingent upon us, if
we understand our cultural heritage
and are to be true to it, to try to
face and understand those problems
clearly?

And must not each of us ask him-
self these questions: How ean I find
a better and happier life for myself?
What can I do to help reconcile
two conflicting social orders so that
all men can live together in some
form of harmony end without mutual
self-destruction? And—how can I
find a meaningful life with my close
friends and family?

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Writer

This column is dedicated this week|
to one of W&L’s most unhearlded
athletes. His strength, endurance,
agility, and toughness had gone un-
recognized until last Saturday when
he gave a small crowd a display of
his fantastic athletic ability with a
performance that will long be re-
membered by the sparce collection
of spectators. Congratulations to
Jolly Girard for his display of amaz-
ing swimming ability.

!three of them and that is the Cleve-
|land Indians.

Let’s look at the Indians objec-
tinvely. They have ten first rate big
league pitchers, eight of whom are
capable of going nine innings and
winning. The outfield is with Wag-
ner, Danalillo, and Colavito can
match the Yankees’ three in power
and average.

The infield has hitters and
ers, although second gaseman Larry
Brown is not a strong sticker. Jake
Azcue handles the catching in fine
tyle. He may have the second best

With due respect to the honorable

predictions that would make a tree

W&L Thumps Catonsville;
Klingelhofer Sparks Rout

The varsity lacrosse team, playing to an enthusiastic crowd,
won its second straight game on Wilson field Saturday, sound-
ly defeating an experienced Catonsville Club from Maryland,

16-5.

Caroll Klingelhofer played his finest game of the year,
scoring five goals and assisting on four more. The other Tri-

captains both contributed goals and*————

played well — Michaels with his ef-
fective ball control and feeding from
behind, and Robertson, who added
eight more ground balls to his im-
pressive season total of forty-three.
Freshman Tom Pittman was also
outstanding, as he netted two goals
and roamed all over the field, lead-
ing the team with ten ground balls.
The close defense of Gambill,
Stewart, and Bendann was tougher
than in previous games and account-
ed for fourteen ground balls. Lance
Bendann held Catonsville’s Hatch,
one of the best players in club le-
crosse, to a single goal. West was
magnificent in the nets and especial-
ly effective with his clearing, fre-
*quently dodging astounded Catons-
ville attackmen as he ran the ball
/to midfield. All players saw action
| for the second consecutive Saturday.

Catonsville opened the seoring
| soon after the opening whistle, but
| the Generals tied it on a beautiful
low shot by Robertson, fed by
| Klingelhofer, They effectively
| controlled the ball throughout the
quarter, as Klingelhofer tallied
twice and assisted on the fourth
goal. Although the Blue seemed to
have a safe lead after the first fif-
teen minutes of play, the visitors
narrowed the gap to 7-4 with
three scores in the second quarter.

The revitalized Generals rallied in
the third and final quarters as they
| continually frustrated the opponents’
| goalies, adding nine goals in the sec-
fond half. Klingelhofer placed his
ithird seore in his favorite upper
lright hand corner and followed with
jan to Bowersox, then tallied
lhis fourth goal on a_ blistering
i ground shot. In addition to his goal,
Bowersox had three assists and was

| outstanding defensively, as he shut
out Catonsville’ tough Fetteroff. The
Blues’ use of three mid-mields and
superior conditioning became evident
in the last period, as the vistors tired
and lost all momentum.

Coach Swan felt that the team
showed greater organization and
ability to work together than in
earlier encounters. The stickmen
worked well as a unit, and there is
a cohesive spirit among the players
as they prepare to enter the rough-
est games of the season. With
thirty-one goals in the two wins,
the squad has shown an offensive
punch and must continue to score
as the competition gets tougher.

Catonsville was an experienced
club, composed of the best stick
handlers the Generals have faced to

' date, yet the Generals took charge in

the second half and played their
game. The statistics clearly indicate
W&L’'s domination — the Blue out-
shot the visitors 52-22 and retrieved
72 ground balls to Catonsville’s 20.

provement, scoring on five of nine
opportunities, while the extra man

cation.” Their lives were not “ruined.”

They certainly had trouble and were
probably inconvenienced, but they
were guilty and had to pay. It’s as
simple as that.

Second, those who propose a one-
year suspension instead of dismissal
do not fully realize the implications of
their suggestion; or, if they do, they
disregard what would happen. Instead
of attempting to explain what could
take place, I will present a hypotheti-
cal situation,

If a student, knowing he will flunk
out if he receives an “F” in phys-
ics, writes five formulas on his palm
which will enable him to pass the
exam, he runs no additional risk
of being caught than if he fell under
the automatic rule. If he is caught
cheating he will be dismissed for a
year. If he fails his exam he will also
be dismissed for a year. In effect,
dishonesty would be put on the same
level with lack of academic achieve-
ment, Effectiveness?

Thirdly, to all who feel a more “hu-

manitarian” approach to the Honor
System should be taken, 1 propose
they study what effect this would have
on the system. I have seen a “humani-
tarian” system work. I have also seen
how students under this systems had
to lock their doors when they went to
take a shower. But, some have said
that no one would steal because we
have a “higher class” of students than
other school. I will relate this without
comment.

Even if we forget (which we can-
not) about things being stolen, what
about cheating? Do you want to take
an exam after studying eight or ten
hours, that someone has had in their
hands for several days? Or, would you

| be the one who had the exam before
it was given?
| Either way, you probably have
feelings on the matter. But I ask that
you consider the problem carefully.
Do not be duped by the idiots who
say that the election was a mandate
for “progress” and then classify prog-
ness” as changing the Honor System.
Those who feel this way are

wrong; wrong in a dangerous way.
They do not know what it is like to
feel the frustrations of working on
something only to see someone else
reap the rewards by cheating. When
they scream for change, I ask that
they think what it would be like in
five years or ten years.

It could happen here, very easily.

paign phrase” and that he would make
every effort to carry out the platform
which carried him to an upset over
the University Party last Friday.

Mindel issued the following state-
ment to the Ring-tum Phi this morn-
ing:

“IT wish to express my most sincere
thanks to all those students who dis-
confidence in me last
Thursday, especially those who work-
ed so long and so well in my behalf.
Without their loyal and dedicated ef-
forts, the outcome of last week’s vot-
ing might have been different.

“The results of the election consti-
tute not so much a mandate for an
individual as for an attitude. “Active
Representation” is not just an empty
campaign phrase, but a vital and prac-
tical method of leadership; a leader-
ship which actually and accurately
leads the student body, rather than
merely oversees it.

“This is our student government. |
It is your responsibility. And it is time |
for all of us to shoulder this respon-
| sibility. I not only invite, but expect, |

the important traditions which

some temporary adverse effects, but
it would also bring lasting and valu-
able results.

The responsibility for clas attend-
ance would pass out of the school-
master’s office and into the hands of
the student himself. Classroom at-
tendance would become a relation-
ship between the professor and the
student.

A student would still feel it
necessary to go to class, but no
longer because he was told. He
would know that few professors
tolerate a prolonged absence, and
he would know that he would be
missing something if he were ab-
sent,

This in practice students would
still ‘be compelled to attend class.
But the anti-intellectual approach of
a cut system would be gone. The
rule would no longer be the over-
riding reason to go to class.

The type of man at Washington
and Lee has changed in the past
years. The quality of education at
Washington and Lee has changed,
too. Now it is time to change the
attitude towards learning. It is time
to stop force feeding W&L students
their education.

What is the attitude of other uni-
versities towards class attendance?
Next week I will examine the situa-
tion of fourteen other universities.
