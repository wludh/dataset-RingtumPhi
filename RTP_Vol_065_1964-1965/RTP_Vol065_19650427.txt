Rising Sun, Maryland, will be running on what he calls a|
“parking”’ ticket.

As vice president of the University Dance Board this
year, this junior will be in charge of the Board next year.

Resolution Asks

Faculty Reform
Cut Regulations

The student body Executive
Committee last night passed a
resolution to the faculty ask-
ing that changes be made in
the present absence rules.

The E.C. resolution, made
after the report of a subcommittes
headed by student body secretary
Malcolm Morris, expresses student
Opinion on possible courses of ac-
tion which will be considered by the
faculty at an upcoming faculty meet-
ing.

The resolution asks that the pres-
ent penalty of automatic failure for
a course
a student who overcut
will lose quality credits instead. The
loss of quality credits would not nec-

overcutiing
ed that

once, be alter-

sO

essarily be so severe as an automatic
“F,” and would not deprive the stu-
dent of satisfying a required course
merely for eutting.

In addition, the E.C. statement in-
cludes a clause asking that all sec-
ond semester seniors be given a
minimum of three weeks of cuts

Milne Case

Last night’s action by the Execu-
tive Committee is the end result of
a prolonged uproar over the
of a freshman, Charles Milne, who
received an “F” for an overcut last

Cast

month. Milne received a great deal
of attention when students put up
posters all over the campus asking
that his “F” be reversed

The Ring-tum Phi asked that the
penalty which caused Milne to re-
the “F” be changed,

Since Milne’s “F” penalty drew
much criticism, at least two student

"Nine Great Universities

Have No Cut Systems

 

By BIFF BARKER
Tuesday Columnist
Today, Washington and Lee stands

teetering on the
brink of  excel-
lence. The educa-

tion explosion has
caused Washington
and Lee’s academie
standards to soar,
This university
can't continue to
meet the chal-
lenge of a new era
still clinging to
outmoded meth-
ods.

Last week the deficiencies of our
present cut system were discussed.
I have written to the deans of a
number of schools, and today I will
examine the attendance require-
ments at these schools. First let's
look at five truly great universities,
Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Dartmouth,
and Princeton.

Harvard and Yale in general place

students. However, freshmen at

Yale must attend P. E.
the winter.

Harvard requires a student who
has had below a .75 average the pre-
vious semester to attend class, and
Yale requires students to go to class

classes during

who for two consecutive semesters
have received roughly the equiva-
lent in Washington and Lee terms
of an average below a 9. Also, pro-
fessors may lower the grades of
students who “flagrantly neglect”
class.

Stanford places no attendance re-
quirements upon its students. How-
ever, students still feel compelled to
come to class because they feel they
can't afford to miss what is going
on, and because they know a pro-
fessor may well lower their grade
for skimpy attendance.

Dr. Thaddeus Seymor, Dean of
Dartmouth College writes, “We
have no college wide policy con-
cerning absences. . . Some in-
structors (and departments) have
arbitrary cut limits, but in most
cases the tradition of a ‘limit’ is
fading fast.”

i is the situation at Prince-
ton? . Richard D. Challener, As-
i ig pe of the College, says,
“Princeton University no longer has
a centrally administered cut system.
The central recording of cuts was
given up seven or eight years ago
Responsibility for attendance is left
to individual members of the faculty
to handle as they determine.

“Some pay little attention to at-
tendance; others, however, establish

certain limits beyond which grades
are affected. A professor may, if he
wishes, report a student for over-
cutting to the dean’s office. In such
instances, we send a formal warning
letter and, on occasion, call the stu-
dent in for a discussion of his situa-
tion. But we do not act unless the
attendance problem is brought di-
rectly to our attention by the fac-
ulty member concerned.”

Five of the greatest universities in
the country, schools which it would
not hurt Washington and Lee to
emulate in many respects, have no
administrative cut system. They be-

lieve that their students can get
along all by themselves.
Small College Examples

Nevertheless, these are large uni-
versities, and some would argue that
they are not comparable to Wash-
ington and Lee. Let's look at four of
the best small schools in the country,
Amherst, Williams, Ponoma, and
Wesleyan.

Pomona College is considered by
most as the best small school in the
west. Here are some excerpts from
a long letter from Dr. Shelton L.
Beatty, Acting Dean of Students at
Pomona:

“The College states that every stu-
dent is ‘expected’ to attend classes,

laboratories, studies, ete. for which
he has enrolled. However, there is
no system of ‘cuts’ allowed or dis-
allowed, even before or after a va-
cation.

“This system works well. We
seek always to emphasize quality

W&L In Class With Slippery Rock, Southern Sem

and responsibility, and stu-
dents do take their job seriously as
a rule. Exceptions exist, but not
many.”

Wesleyan had a centrally adminis-
tered cut system until two years ago.
Now, however, students have un-
limited cuts. Until this year a rule
remained requiring students to at-
tend class before and after each
holiiday, but now that rule too has
been abolished

Dr. William L. Swartzbaugh, Asso-
ciate Dean of Amherst College sent
the following: “It is assumed students
will make the most of educational
opportunities available by regularly
attending classes and laboratory pe-
riods.

“At the beginning of each semes-
ter each instructor is free to state his
policy with regard to absence in his
course, and therefore he may report
to the Dean’s office the name of any
student who violates the announced

Williams College has just rid itself
of an administrative cut system.
Writes Benjamin W. Labares, Dean

| Williams College, “As part of a
program giving each student a larg-
er share of responsibility for his own
education, Williams College no long-
er administers a general system of
required classroom attendance, as of
September, 1964.

“Although no formal system ol
class attendance is maintained by the
college, an instructor may set such
standards of attendance which he
feels are necessary for the satisfac-
tory conduct of his course. Students
who fail to meet these standards
ijmay be warned by the instructor
and notice sent to the Dean that
continued absence will result in their
being dropped from that course.”

We have looked at nine of the
finest universities in the country,
both large and small, and not one

of them forces its students to go to
class. The cut system at W&L to-

Dear Sir:

Mr. Tyler in the April 20 edition

| of debate. In the course of this
| debate one of the primary fune-
| tions of the Honor System is ful-
| filled. People are educated into

over the alteration of the Honor Sys-

tem and serious confusion over w hat) what honor means. They gain a

1e nature of Man in general
Washington an Lee in particular.

As I understand it, the proposed
one-year suspension is offered as an
alternative punishment for an honor
violation

permanent expulsion.

‘
‘

Consider the example of a case in
which the violation was clearly
spontaneous or unpremeditated and
the person invelved would, beyond
reasonable doubt, benefit from a
suspension of one year. This is, I
suppose, what Mr. Tyler would
term “one moment's indiscretion”.

Mr. Tyler not only does not allow
this possibility but goes on to sug-|
gest that, quote, “A person lies,
eheats, or steals he either does
or he doesn't”. This is pure “fic-
tion” about the nature of Man.
Every man lies, cheats or steals
either to others or to himself

The principle of absolute hon-
esty which lies behind Mr. Tyl-
ers statement would convict of
guilt every person, for instance,
who has ever told someone else,
“1 leve vou.” in order either to
justify his action or to gain some
advantage from the other.

Win A Few
Lose A Few

By TOM CARPENTER

The biggest news in sports on the
Washington and Lee campus is the
no-hitter pitched by Pete Heumann
last Tuesday against Richmond Pro-
fessional Institute. This was the first
no-hitter by a W&L hurler in many
seasons.

Heumann also won the award for
the quote of the year. While
the Generals were batting late in
the game, Heumann was overheard
to say, “Not another Harvey Haddix,
fellows. Not another Harvey Had-
dix.” Haddix, as you probably know,
was the man who pitched a 12-inn-
ing perfect game only to lose in the
thirteenth on homerun by Joe
Adcock.

Actually Heumann’s comment was
somewhat inappropriate in that he
was not exactly hurling perfect
game. Pete had walked several bat-
ters and had also allowed one run.
He shuld have to Ken
Johnson, the Houston Astro pitcher,
who lost a no-hitter last year. But
Pete was referring to the extra inn-
ing aspect of Haddix’s defeat.

Michaels popped in two more scores
and the visitors led 3-1 at the end of
the first quarter. Klingelhofer and
Michaels scored twice in the second
and Robertson added a solo tally to
the Generals a comfortable 8-1
lead at halftime.

The W&L stickmen did not let
down in the second half but coen-

Mike Michaels, whe played the
finest game of his four year career
at W&L, fired three more past

Caroll Klingelhofer took only

was the fourth game in which
Klingelhofer has paced the team,
and with thirty-one points is a
solid contender for All-American
honors. Duncan LaMonte, playing
both mid-field and attack, scored
twice. Bowersox played his usual

On the contrary, although the schools
mentioned here have hade provisions
to handle the few exceptions, they
nevertheless assume the best of their
students. Each of the schools as-
that its students are intelligent
enough to know they must attend

Are Washington and Lee Stu-

3. “On the cut system—I can not

Steinger, who is also running in-
dependently, is an officer in his fra-
ternity and a member of the business
staff of the Southern Collegian; both
students are members of Phi Eta
Sigma.

Steinger hopes to bring about
“more student control of student af-
fairs’ in an effort to realize the
“necessity for more effective leader-
ship and greater participation in stu-
dent government.”

As part of his platform he plans
to “encourage more frequent meet-
ings between the E.C. representa-
tives and the class officers, seek
recognition of non-fraternity stu-
dents by providing recreational fa-
cilities for them, establish hours dur-
ing which the residents of Baker
j and Davis dorms will be allowed to
entertain girls in their rooms, sup-
port the principle of conventional
dress and the honor system as it
stands, and work towards a system
of unlimited cuts which would ex-
clude first semester freshmen.”

ing a sophomore office pending
clique nominations and other devel-

a sudden spontaneous outburst of
students proclaiming their inten-
tions of running.

Two other obvious candidates for
high office in the rising sophomore
class are Richard Nash, this year’s
E.C. member, and Steve Saunders,
whom Nash narrowly defeated last
fall. Both Nash and Saunders have
wide support in the class.

Other names which have been

potential candidates are Rudd Smith
