‘An Enemy of the People’

By MIKE DUNN
Associate Editor

An Enemy of the People, Henrik
Ibsen’s drama of social criticism, will
be presented beginning February 17
as the Troubadours’ second produc-
tion of the 1964-65 season.

Ibsen’s play is a study of the indi-
vidual against society. In a small Nor-
wegian town, a doctor discovers that
carelessly-laid water pipes and local
industry have contaminated the water
supply. To his surprise, his fellow citi-
zens refuse to act. Ironically, they
meet in a democratic town council and
vote to ignore the truth rather than
speak out against authority.

Tryouts Held

Tryouts for the roles were held last
Wednesday night at the Troubadour
Theatre. The leading role, Dr. Thomas
Stockmann, will be played by Trou-
badour president Charlie Bright.
Starke Sydnor will play Peter Stock-
mann, the mayor of the town, while
Lockhart Handley has the role of Mor-
ton Kiil, a factory owner.

Other parts announced include Lew
Davis as a newspaper editor, Bob
Hudson as a reporter, and Steve Mil-
lard as Horster, a ship’s captain. Jay
Hight will be the printer Aslaksen, and
Tim Webster plays a drunk.

Other townspeople will include Jim
Settle, Roger Clark, Fred Suttle, Frank
Fairchild, Jay Cady, George Kistler,
and Ward Briggs. No more parts have
been announced yet.

New Version
“This play is perhaps Ibsen’s best
social criticism,” said Dr. Cecil D.
Jones, director, “but it does have

something to say. It deals with the
courage which the individual requires
in every time. The events in this play
can happen today just as well as in
the 1890's.”

Dr. Jones added that Ibsen is only
slowly regaining popularity in the
English-speaking world, because for
many years stilted, outdated Victorian
translations of his works were the only
ones available. The Troubadours will
use a new adaptation by playwright
Arthur Miller which uses a more mod-
ern speech. This, said Dr. Jones, does
away with the “Victorian period piece”
atmosphere of the older versions.

The cast for An Enemy of the People
will begin rehearsals next week.

The Troubadours first play of the
year, Shakespeare’s The Merchant of
Verice, drew capacity audiences dur-
ing its four day run in November. It
also received critical praise from re-
viewers.

Anyone interested in acting in Ib-
sen’s play should see Dr. Jones im-
mediately. He stated that a few parts
are still open. Others interested in
working on the play in production of
sales capacities are asked to contact
either Dr. Jones or Charlie Bright.

Dr. James Silver To Make
Address, Conduct Seminar

By LARRY MEEKS
Managing Editor
Dr. James W. Silver, author of Mississippi: The Closed
Society and past president of the Southern Historical Associa-
tion, has accepted an invitation to be one of the principle
speakers at CONTACT, Washington and Lee’s IFC sponsored

intellectual symposium.
Announcement of his acceptance came in a special meeting

of the CONTACT Steering Committee with its faculty advis-
ors, Mr. Whitehead, Dean Atwood, and Dr. Moger of the Fac-

ulty Committee on Lectures.

Dr. Silver has been a member of the faculty of the Uni-
versity of Mississippi for some twenty-eight years. He is cur-
rently on a year’s leave of absence to teach and study at Notre
Dame.

His book, Mississippi: The Closed Society, has received
great acclaim both as an address he gave as President of the
Southern Historical Association and as a book. It appeared on
the “Best Seller’ list of the New York Times Book Review for

fourteen weeks and Book Week magazine has listed it as one
~ *of the best works for the year 1964,
especially noting his acute analysis
|0f the Mississippi problem.”
Professor Lewis Atherton of the
University of Missouri, in reviewing
Dr. Silver’s book says that “Silver
has written a highly important book,
both timely and timeless in nature...”

To Keep Conventional Dress

By BILLY CANNON

News Editor
The student body in a referendum
on conventional dress and the As- |
similation Committee held Wednesday |
voted overwhelmingly to preserve the
tradition of conventional dress on the |
Washington and Lee campus and sup-
ported to a lesser extent the Assimila- |

tion Committee as it now stands.

 

The referendum, brought about by
a student petition, showed 89.3 per |
cent of the student body in favor of |
conventional dress. Of the 464 per
cent of the students who voied, 59 per
cent felt both conventional dress and
the Assimilation Committee should re-
main. However, 65 per cent of the bal- |
lots indicated some criticism of the |
way the Assimilation Commitice is
being run. |

Students were asked to make one
of the following choices: 1) I agree
with the tradition of conventional dress
and the Assimilation Committee as it
now stands. 2) I agree with the tradi-
tion of conventional dress and the As- |
similation Committee, but I believe |
that there should be come change im)

“I don't think it's a burden on any

lack of spirit, however, has hurt it.”

views concerning both the tradition
of conventional dress and the Assimi-

constructive criticism would result.

Wednesday's referendum was the
culmination of a controversy which
had raged over this campus for the
past five years. It marked the first
time that the tradition of convention-

to a direct student vote, although the

In addition to his major address, Dr.

dents. The subject of this seminar will
be an unpublished paper that he has
written on the lack of leadership in the
ante-bellum South. The student po-
sitions on the seminar are open, and
interested students should apply for
these positions by writing to CON-
TACT, Box 53.

Students participating in the sem-
inar will be given a copy of the text of
the paper so that they may prepare for
the discussion. Dr. Silver's seminar is
set tentatively for 2 p.m. on Satur-
day, March 13.

Apathy In The Academy

A club long in existence, but heretofore unrecognized, on
the W&L campus has finally been chartered.

 

 

 

The constitution of the “new” Apathy Club has been of- |

ficially drawn up. “The action was taken,” a spokesman for the
group said, ‘in order to help crystalize—or perhaps coagulate
a feeling that has been prevalent on this campus for a long
time.” The purpose of the club will be “to vegetate, thus mak-
ing any worthwhile project or endeavor on campus as much a
failure as possible.”

“As you know,”
we have a great problem. We hope to bring that problem to the
attention of the student body.” He then read the charter in
full:

We, the students of Washington and Lee, in order that we
may become completely lackadaisical and incompetent of good
judgment, and guided by a disorganized and disconcerted
effort, do hereby establish this constitution toward a philoso-
phy of non-commitment at WeL.

This do-nothing body shall henceforce be known as the
Apathy Club of W&L. Its motto shall be: ‘Omnia pro me et
ego pro nullo,’ which translated, means: ‘All for me and me
for none.’

In
*

this organization there will be:

No officers, for this might stir interest, create re-
sponsibility, and lead to competent performance of
duties.

No dues.

Meetings once every two years in the old Co-op,
anyone attending being subject to immediate dis-
missal from the organization on the grounds of
showing interest in anything—even apathy.

*
*

Those who are allowed to be in this elite group must prove
that they are not active members in any other organization on
campus and that they have done nothing responsible or in the
least requiring initiative. To qualify they must: a.) never ask
questions in class other than required test material, how long
term papers should be, if they should be typed, etc., b.) be
completely silent at all athletic events unless they are

Our Neighbors Down the Street

 

Student Life Radically Different At V M1

By Warren Montgomery and
John Yager
Feature Editor, Cadet First-Classman

The most striking aspect of W&L-
V.MI. student relations is their virtual
non-existence. Most W&L_ students
know more about
U. Va. 75 miles
1| away, in Charlot-
tesville than about
our next - door

neighbors at V.M.I.
' This mutual iso-
| lation of V.MLI. and
| W&L is due, to a
large degree, to the
| staggering differ-
ences between the
two schools. They
are so dissimilar
that there remains no basis for co-

their joint efforts make the town of
Lexington possible.
A Parting of the Ways

The chasm between V.M.I. and W&L
opens with the arrival of the freshmen
in Lexington in September of each
year. Both freshmen enter the town
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, eager
to learn, and innocently enthusiastic
about the colleges of their choice. One
freshman first sees a masterpiece of
ante-bellum Greek-revival architect-
ure, reeking with liberal education and
tradition. The other sees a squat, yel-
low fortress complete with battle-
ments, portcullises, turrets, gargoyles,
shutes for pouring boiling sulfur on
the enemy, and other innovations of
modern warfare.

After a few enlightening days at
freshman camp, the W&L frosh goes

 

operation, rivalry, or association be-

tween them. About the only thing mel

two schools hold in common is that

organization.

These members may attend social events on one condition: | ;

that they be ungentlemanly and disorderly at all of these af-| 92% 5)

fairs whether held by the University or not. The truly un-

pardonable sin is to be any member’s personal involvment with | %;
any person on other than an objective plane. Members must} ’

regard others as objects.

This constitution will be duly ratified if a majority of the
student body who can prove they have not voted since their
first semester at W&L or showed any interest in anything at
all recognize this club to be worthwhile.

When asked how students could recognize this club to be
worthwhile and yet remain apathetic, the spokesman would
make no comment.

The Referendum

W&L’s unusual student referendum has been held, and the
statistics are in. We do not yet know whether the Executive
Committee will act on the results of Wednesday's vote, but
there are several conclusions that are immediately apparent
from the results.

Unfortunately, only 47 per cent of the student body vot-
ed. The best that can therefore be said for the results of the
referendum is that they are possibly indicative of the wishes of
the student body, but that they are certainly not conclusive.
On the basis of the meagre vote, we can make some good
guesses but no definite statements.

We were pleased to note that 89.3 per cent of those who
voted checked off items 1, 2, or 3, on the official ballot, all of
which expressed basic agreement with the tradition of conven-
tional dress. As inconclusive as the total vote might be, we
hope that a nine-tenths vote for conventional dress _ will
strengthen its enforcement in the future.

On the other hand, 65 per cent of those who voted checked
items 2, 3, or 4 on the official ballot. All of these items ex-
pressed some degree of dissatisfaction with the administration
of the Assimilation Committee. Again, in light of the total
vote, this statistic is unreliable, but it is to be hoped that the
Executive Committee will give some consideration to the vari-
ous criticisms written on the referendum ballots.

Political Horizons

 

By Brett W. Hawkins
Assistant Professor of Political Science

A frequently noted characteristic of
American politics is that the fervent
partisan, observing that his party has
lost an election, resists the conclusion
that the public is departing from his
that his party, by compromising its
principles to win the votes of the cen-
ter, has left a large body of its follow-
ers too disgruntled to participate in the
election.

This kind of plausible argument is
often very useful, as its frequent ap-
pearance attests. Most recently, of
course, it served the cause of con-

 

Cinema Review Editor |

servative Republicans, who evidently
believed (1) that there was a large
group of “disgruntled” Republicans
who had not participated in elections
since Herbert Hoover and (2) that a
considerable proportion of the other
non-voters (independents and Dem-
ocrats) would support a man who of-
fered them a meaningful choice.

Evidence for Beliefs

What kind of evidence existed to
support such beliefs? Very little in
fact. Two kinds of propositions were
offered, however. The first suggested
that one personally knew of this or
that individual, or group, who had re-
fused to vote for “liberal” Republi-
cans. The second suggested that the
1956 election shattered the notion that
non-voters are inevitably more Dem-
oeratic than the electorate as a whole,
for in that year the non-voters inter-
viewed after the election were over-
whelmingly in favor of General Eisen-
hower.

The first proposition, as evidence,
can only be termed ridiculous. Any
insistence that personal experience of
this sort is significant might be of in-
terest to psychologists, but not to
political scientists. The second propo-
sition, however, cannot be dismissed so
easily. It is very true that a 1956 study
dealt severe blows to a proposition
that had become one of the axioms of
American politics

derful fellow he is (e.g., “It was so
nice to have you down to the
house—drop by to see us some-
time”). The V.M.I. freshman, or
“rat” as he is thereafter called, un-
dergoes one week of intensive mili-
tary training. He learns to drill,
grovel, drill, cringe, drill, fawn, drill,
and shine shoes.

Protective Guidance

As time progresses the W&L fresh-
man is amazed with the change be-
tween life at home and life at college.
At home, he is under the protective
guidance of his parents; at W&L, he
has complete freedom to do whatsoever
he wishes, short of violating the law
too blatantly. The V.M.I. rat is also
amazed at differences between life at
home and life at college. At V.M.L, he
is placed under the protective guidance
of an upperclassman “dike.” This dike
(or big brother) gives the rat moral
support and an occasional paddling to
teach him to be more grateful. In ex-
change for these inestimable services,
the rat must merely spit-shine the
shoes of his dike, make his bed, clean
his room, boost his ego with reptilian
subservience, perform various chores
and errands, and serve as a foil for
the dike’s incidental pugnacity.

The rat is kept in top physical
around

the parade ground, supervised by
the ever-benevolent upperclassmen.
His mind is sharpened by memoriz-
ing a 40-page Rat Bible containing
such essential information as the
names of all the antique cannons
which cover the campus. The rat
re-learns the art of walking, taking
care to always scurry along next
to the walls (the rat line), change
his direction of travel only by 90
degree angles, and to cram his chin
into his 19th century collar.

better. He spends the dance impatient-
ly waiting for the end of the dreary
performance so he can furtively head

a blanket, his date, and fifths of bour-
bon clutched in each hand. It is, inci-
dentally, a dismissal offense to be
caught drunk or in the possession of
liquor.

Sunday mornings’ entertainment

Step-off

When W&L students have com-
plaints about the system (and these
are few and strained), they write a
letter to the editor, or start a petition,
or more likely, simply lapse into their
customary apathy after a little con-
servative grumbling. At V.M.I., open
complaints are rare and mercifully
suppressed if directed against upper-
classmen by a rat. Every few years or
so, however, the stored-up protests
penetrate the iron-clad V.M.I. regimen.
On such occasions, such milktoast no-
tions as letters or petitions are thrown
to the winds. What follows is a full-
scale insurrection, otherwise known as
a “step-off.”

In a step-off, after a Ist class
(senior) meeting, the president of
the class orders the rats to “step-
off the rat line” (i.e., untuck their
chins, turn by increments of 45 de-
grees if they so wish, walk in the
middle of the hall, etc.). Mass de-
struction of the barracks follows.
Led by a first-class organization
known as the Dirty Thirty, the rats
and cadets first cut V.M.L’s meagre
communications with the world, the
telephones and power lines. Next,
they burst all the plumbing by sim-
ultaneously turning on and shutting

brink of sobriety, almost, sometimes,
letting themselves be seen and

munication—even to such a world
as this, where the weeks are three
days long, with a mysterious five-

There is little fascination, there is
little to discover, the pattern remains

we travel the road for them.

Plan For Lee College
Might Be Surrender
Of Ivy To “*Bigness”
By TRACY HARRINGTON
Friday Columnist

Regrettably, there has been little
discussion of the “Lee College” pro-
posal.

To recap: Dr. Cole in his opening
address suggested that the present
W&L become “Washington College,”

and that a newly established “Lee
College” become a twin institution.

Friday
Columnist
Harrington

Together, the colleges—separate but

equal, as it were— would form Wash-
ington and Lee University
WA&L’s Obligation

Since that initial bombshell, public

analysis of the idea has been near-
ly nil. This is unfortunate; for the
proposal should be examined careful-
ly, and, in this writer's opinion, dis-
carded.

If I recall correctly, Cole's main ar-
gument for Lee College was that it
would be a necessity in order for

W&L to “fulfill its educational obli-
gations of the future.”

Why? Washington and Lee's ob-
ligation, it seems, is to provide the best
liberal arts education it can; to grow
in academic excellence; and to pre-
serve the small college personal at-
mosphere that prevails. Cole really
seems to be saying that it behooves us
to increase our numbers because there
are look uw
educations. Our obligation, he intimat

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Eagles Edge by Generals, 87-81
Seek First Win Against Centre

By GUY UNANGST

A high-seoring guard-forward com-
bination made coach Verne Canfield’s
Doremus debut an unsuccessful one
Tuesday. Tomorrow night another
such combination comes to town.

With Bridgewater’s All-State guard
Paul Hatcher scoring 34 points, 14 of
them on free throws, and Joe Browder
23, Washington and Lee lost its home
opener and third straight, 87-81.

Outshot from the floor, Bridgewater
had the benefit of five W&L foul-outs
and 43 foul shots.

Tomorrow’s opponent, Centre, brings
juniors Mike Marks (6-4) and Julian
Palmer (5-11), both All-College Con-
ference, Last season they were one-
two in team scoring, averaging 33.4
points a game total.

Hoping to cut down the number
of fouls against Centre (W&L has
fouled 86 times in three games), Can-
field had this week’s practice sessions
officiated.

With Hatcher's

Browder’s jump

free
shots,

 

overcame a 32 per cent second half
accuracy for its six point spread.

Jeff Twardy’s lay-up gave the Gen-
erals the lead, 59-58, early in the sec-
ond period. W&L moved ahead four
points, but Bridgewater tied at 68,
then moved six points in front after
Twardy and Tom Cox fouled out.

Thereafter, W&L never got closer
than three points. Bridgewater pulled
away on free throws in the closing
minutes.

The Generals hit 54 per cent of their
shots while holding the Eagles to 41
per cent and but a dozen second half
field goals. Their harrassing defense,
however, fouled 31 times, and too of-
ten it fouled Hatcher. The 6-0 senior
made 14 of 18 free throws.

Centre beat W&L by 16 and 18
points in two games last year. Last
year it was 14-8, and second in the
CAC.

Fred Mindel was high W&L scorer
Tuesday, with 23. He’s hit 17 of 28
for 07 percentage in three games...

late in the first half against Bridgewater. Saunders got 6 points in the game.

On defense, David, as a corner back,

viewed David as a potential prospect

was the first W&L boy whom he has

ed, is to grow numerically as well as
intellectually,

The United States is today plagued
by Bigness. The thesis that quality in-
evitably means quantity reigns su-
preme. Universities are no longer
single institutions. They are huge com-
plexes of buildings and bureaucracies,
where education is mass production
efficiently overseen by screeching,
whining computers. The government
and large foundations sanction this
monolithic mania with generous of-
ferings of funds.

What President Cole has suggested
would in no way make Washington
and Lee into one of these ivy-covered
IBM’s. But the very fact of his pro-
posal can be viewed as a sort of com-
promise, a gesture of conciliation with
the powers of Bigness that be. Wash-
ington and Lee has enough to do with-
out doubling its size; indeed, this

off all the toilets, faucets, and show-
ers in the barracks. Finally _,the
furniture is thrown down from up
to three stories high into the court-
yard, windows and light bulbs are
smashed, and the walls are smeared
with paint. Periodical step-offs are a
tradition at V.M.1.—the last occur-
red in 1961 and cost $7,000.

The W&L student generally looks
down with varying degrees of pity on
the V.MI. cadet. He also perhaps sub-
consciously admires anyone who can
endure such a wretched existence. The
cadet wishes he were a W&L student,
but after graduation (at which time
he has attained the high honor of 2nd
lieutenant cannon-fodder) he becomes
the world’s most fanatic alumnus.

It would be almost impossible to
comparatively evaluate V.M.I. and
W&L because of the almost total lack
of a common basis for comparison.
Certainly, the W&L mink is happier
than his veemie counterpart, and in
this respect, W&L is better. Howev-
er, the end accomplished and not the
method of accomplishing it is what is
important in the long run, and V.M.L
ean certainly compare with W&L
for the number of prominent men
that have been trained there.

seems a rather curious course to take,
when there are so many more con-
structive options open for future de-
velopment.

The money and efforts which would
go into creating Lee College can better
be expended in perfecting the school
we already have. The library needs
expanding; departmental facilities and
faculties can certainly be improved.
Increased salaries could help us keep
the good men we have and bring new
ones to the campus. Seminars, guest
lecturers, research opportunities for
students—these are the areas which
need study and attention, and to which
we should direct ourselves rather than
to plans of simple expansion.

There are purely practical consid-
erations, too. From where is the en-
rollment for Lee College to come?
W&L already has enough trouble
maintaining entrance standards. A
doubled amount of acceptances would
necessitate a doubled amount of ap-
plications if present standards are to
be kept. How does President Cole plan
to insure this? What about town fa-
cilities? Can Lexington support two

I have, after some deliberate delib-
eration, come up with a solution which
will solve all of these problems and
get our fair campus back upon its
collective feet once more.

What we must do is to make the
new Lee College a college for fe-
males. Over here we could have

Washington and Lees? It can hardly
support one, as Dr. Cole could readily
observe were he to watch students
trying to get restaurant service at the
dinner hour on Sunday.

One might agree that the establish-
ment of Lee College would provide a
welcome stimulus to Lexington; and

so it would. Business would boom.
But this is hardly a valid considera-
tion, since our primary concern is

Washington and Lee as an educational
institution and not the enhancement of
Lexington’s economy.

Washington and Lee’s status as a
small liberal arts college gives this
university a special kind of unique-
ness. That uniqueness, I predict, will
become increasingly valuable and at-
tractive as more and more colleges
submit to Bigness. It remains for us
to strive toward perfecting our small
liberal arts college, to grow academic-
ally and intellectually; in these direc-
tions should our efforts and interests
be turned, not in the direction of a
numerical growth which is neither
necessary nor in the best interests of
Washington and Lee’s objectives.

there in the countryside we could
have, say, Sarah Lee College. This
sister institution will solve most if
not all of our problems and enable
us to once again devote our full at-
tention to what college is All About
(whatever that is).

Lf

First of all, the presence of Sarah
Lee College will solve any difficulty
and rebelliousness (“man is born free
and everywhere he is in coats and
ties”) we may have had with Con-
ventional Dress. If there are gals near-
by we will all want to dress in our
best snowsuits and be clean and neat
and coatie and tieie to attract a fair
maiden to our individual lairs.

And, hand in hand, so to speak,
will follow our Speaking Tradition.
Most of us always say something to
every girl we pass so that we would
be most happy to continue this in
our contacts with Sarah Lee.

Most of our weekend hazards of
driving to Faraway Places to find com-
panionship will be eliminated by hav-
ing women on our dorstep. Any free
Saturdays the faculty grudgingly per-
mits us to make use of would be spent
in Lexington and not on trips up or
down or across the road. And it is psy-

to Sarah Lee than to voyage many
miles to find out that she has a head-

ers than on voters. (These conclusions
are based on data from the 1948, 1952
and 1956 elections.) It therefore seems
reasonable to be guided by John F.
Kennedy’s 1960 victory, plus the emo-
tional stimulus of the assassination,
to the conclusion that by 1964 most of
the non-voters should have been firm-
ly in the Democratic camp. The al-
ternative conclusion, it seems to me,
is highly implausible.

Acceptance Speech
Another assumption entertained by

the Goldwater strategists was that the| Goldwater was legendary and

“other”

 

turn to the fold without overt concil- |
iatory gestures, apparently in the be- |

lief that they would have no choice.
The crucial question here, of course,
whether conditions in some states per-
mitted the other wing to exert itself
for a comparatively doctrinaire ticket,
such as one representing two conser-
vatives, each with a problem of being
associated with “extremists.”
Perhaps the most pertinent fact here
was that the refusal of the conserva-
tives to budge on platform provisions,

}on the choice of a vice-presidential

candidate, and on the crucial accep-
tance speech played into the hands of
those who argued that conditions in
some states dictated a shun-Goldwat-
er approach, regardless of whether the
latter were factually correct or not.
It is my personal opinion, indeed, that
Senator Goldwater’s unfortunate ac-
ceptance speech totally destroyed his

chances of a decent showing at elec-
tion time. No man who enters a cam-
paign with such disabilities can hope
to do well by reinforcing those dis-
abilities in his first important public
address.

It is also my personal opinion that
the usual conciliatory approach on the
platform, the running-mate, and the
acceptance speech—plus an abandon-
ment of the Southern Strategy—would
have held in tow virtually all of the
traditional Republicans. It would also
have held the great bulk of conser-
vatives, whose affection for Senator
who

wing of the Party would re-| truly had no place to go. In the ab-

sence of holding the election over
again, however, and applying the above
strategy one can never know whether
it would have “worked.”
