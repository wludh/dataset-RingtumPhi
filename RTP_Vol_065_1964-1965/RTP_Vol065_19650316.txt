Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

Tuesday Edition

Unjust, Unreasonable

The current uproar over a freshman, Charles Milne,
who was given an F in a course he overcut in circum-
stances which seem to have been beyond his control, draws
attention to a rule which deserves all the criticism that
can be directed at it. To drop a student from a class with
an F for taking one cut is not only unreasonably harsh, it
is also punishment unrelated to the infraction committed.

Probably most of the faculty will admit the injustice
of this rule, but it is retained because it is all that stands
between the student body and the horrors of unlimited
cuts. Assuming that there must be a cut system—and’
although the principle of the thing is insulting, at least in
practice the W&L system is liberal in the number of cuts
it allows—if there is to be such a system, then it should be
backed by a penalty fitting the infraction.

Last week the Ring-tum Phi suggested that the penalty
be extra homework. The administration greeted the pro-
posal with a chuckle. But nobody is laughing over the
number of students who have been given F’s for absences
in the last several years. Some change should be devised
to prevent this, and if extra work in the class in which
lectures are missed does not fit the bill, then perhaps a
heavy fine—say $25—is the answer. Students already face
smaller fines for cutting University Assemblies. Another
possible penalty is the one which was discarded a few
years ago in favor of the present F: loss of quality credits.
While this would still be too heavy a penalty, it could be
an improvement over the present one. Still another sug-
gestion: lower the cutting student’s grade in the course
affected by one letter grade for each overcut, rather than
giving him an F outright.

Any of these would be better than the present penal-
ty. However, the Ring-tum Phi is not at all convinced that
homework can be laughed off. By “homework,” of
course, we do not have in mind some mechanical exercise,
but a constructive task such as a book report or even a
research paper. It is a penalty which could be made as
light or as heavy as the student’s circumstances in the
course required. It would actually be helpful to the stu-
dent, and could obviously be designed to more than make
up for the lectures missed.

Objections to assigning homework, or extra papers,
for students who overcut, are two: it would create extra
work for professors, and it sounds “preppy.” Extra
work would place a heavier burden on the faculty, of
course: but there would not be much of it, and we would
hope that professors would rather grade an extra paper
from a student than see him receive an F he does not de-
serve. An alternative to the faculty’s extra work would be
for professors not to grade the extra work with the same
care they give their regular assignments.

The second objection to the proposal, that it smacks
of prep school, is also a valid argument. Yet if a home-
work penalty smacks of prep school, the present penalty
of awarding an F takes us back to the dark ages. There
is simply no way to avoid having a petty penalty—
or something worse, which is what we have now—for a
petty system. The cut system is a hand-slapping system
for a student body which the faculty does not consider
mature; the penalty ought to suit the system. Instead
of cutting the hand off, it should slap.

The Ring-tum Phi asks for some change to stop stu-
dents’ receiving F’s for overcutting. It does not seem
too much to ask that such a change be retroactive for
Charles Milne, the freshman who hitch-hiked to Wash-
ington last weekend in the expectation ot receiving there
the money to pay for a bus ticket back to Lexington, but
who could not obtain the money to get back in time for
Monday classes. Mr. Milne, a Robert E. Lee scholar, is
more than most an undeserving victim of a penalty which
almost no Washington and Lee student really deserves.

Briggs Lauds Delicacy an

d Maturity

In “The Girl with the Green Eyes”

By WARD BRIGGS
Cinema Columnist
Presently at the Lyric is Girl with
Green Eyes, appropriately in black
and white. It stars
Rita Tushingham
as Kate, an Irish
country girl, who
her Cath-
olic family for the
first time and
tastes the freedom

of the city.

It seems as
though this whole
experience is a re-
creation of one of
Miss Tushingham’s
girlhood memories, just as the mar-
ried man she falls in love with is
the culmination of every quality
an inexperienced girl is likely to
have of her ideal lover.

Eugene Gaillard is mature, sophis-
tieated, considerate, and a writer.
Peter Finch is everything this girl
wishes for while still managing to
be a flesh and blood human, who is
lonely and listless, fascinated by
Kate’s innocence but bored by her
gaucherie and irritated by her pos-
sessiveness

leaves

 

 

 

Not an unkind man, but one who
has long understood the transitori-
ness of emotion. It is this sense of
inevitable heartbreak that gives the
film its underlying seriousness.

Kate’s fierce determination to
seize her happiness and hold on is
doomed from the start, but her
struggles are funny as well as sad,
sometimes farcical as the tragedies
of the very young often are. Even
such commonplace attempts as the
smoking of a cigarette end in humi-
liation when the burning weed slips
down her corsage and is doused by
a nicely aimed jug of cold milk.

But Kate is resilient, and in the
little epilogue which brings the film
to its slightly too abrupt close she
is seen finding new friends and in-
terests in London. Already her
experience with Eugene has become
part of the process of growing up.

The relationship between the two
is, of course, the central thread of
the film, but is woven into an amus-
ing appraisal of the Irish scene,
which never sinks to cynicism or bit-
terness, but takes the obvious way
to a cheap joke.

Kate and her best friend Baba are
neatly contrasted types of convent-

 

 

bred adolescents. Kate, played by
Rita Tushingham with wide-eyed
sensitivity, is a serious-minded girl
with a tender conscience. Her repres-
sive upbringing makes is impossible
for her to surrender to Eugene at
first, much as she wants to, and
these bedroom scenes are handled
with the admirable delicacy.

Baba, on the other hand, would
never have hesitated. With her, the
nuns have been wasting their time.
A slap-happy, mildly sluttish young
woman ,all brash confidence and ig-
norant bounce, she is brought to life
by Lynn Redgrave, in a debut of
startling brilliance.

Coming Thursday is The Prize,
starring Paul Newman and Elke

Sommer. The plot is so formidably
silly that you can’t but wonder why

the film-makers themselves didn’t
realize its absurdity.
Irving Wallace’s best seller took

itself far more solemnly; but Ernest
Lehman, scriptwriter of North By
Northwest has concocted out of the
book an engaging fantasy in which

We may frankly admit at the

Gilbert flatters the intelligence of

this opera than in any other.

He assumes that we know the dis-
tinctions of the peerage, the geo-
uraphy of London, the men about
town in the 1880's—that we under-
stand all about Whigs and Tories,
the cherished rights M.P.’s enjoy on

the grouse and salmon season, and
the way to Bill—that we

Out of all the brillance of this
sparkling opera, who can choose

the delightful conceit of the hero
Strephon, who is immortal down to
the waist while his lower half

the very earthy shepherdess, Phyl-

| Win A Few..

By TOM CARPENTER |
The Sunday edition of the Wash-
ington Post contained a short article
dealing with three colleges applying
for membership in the Mason-Dixon
Conference. This article brings to
mind the point that has been dis-
cussed many times recently, Should
Washington and Lee remain in CAC?
Why not join the Mason-Dixon
Conference?

The three colleges hoping to be-
come members of the Mason-Dixon
Conference are Shephrd College of
West Virginia, Frederick College of
Portsmouth, and Richmond Profes-
sional Institute. All three are small
colleges about the size of W&L and
all have to scramble to get athletes
comparable to the ones at W&L.

Mason-Dixon Schools

Other schools in this conference

Lose A Few... |

 

are, for example, Hampden-Sydney
and Randolph-Macon. Neither of,
these schools has had any better)
football teams in recent years than)
those of the Generals.

Both have had outstanding basket-|
ball teams compared to those at]
W&L, but then basketball at W&L|}
has been deficient in recent time.
Only two teams in the conference,
Lynchburg and Macon, have had
with much talent
as those of coach Lyles’.

Money Being Wasted

The point is that W&L is wasting
money by playing in the CAC when
there exists a local conference with
schools on the athletic level
W&L. It seems that the athletic
department would rather spend
money on trips into Tennessee and
Kentucky to St. Louis when the}
money could be spent on improve-|
ments of the athletic facilities here}

at W&L.

Besides, the Generals have no right
being in the same conference with
Washington University. Washington
usually has one of the best small
college football teams in the nation
and this year qualified for the NAIA
small college basketball tournament.
Their ‘baseball team
looked like a prep team for the big
leagues. It was a tribute to the foot-
ball Generals that they came as
close as they did to Washington this
year.

In basketball in particular the
Generals have had very little suc-
cess in the CAC. Of course one
might add that the Generals have
had very little success, period, and
the Mason-Dixon Conference con-
tains small college basketball powers

like Hampden-Sydney and Ran-
dolph-Macon. But under Coach

Verne Canfield’s recruiting system,
within three the Generals
should be on par with both of these
schools.

years

Rivalries Will Develope

Another reason for a switch in
conferences the possibility that
W&L will develop one or two intra-
state rivalries that will bring about
an increased school spirit and also
in attendance. The only important
CAC rivalry exists between W&L
and Sewanee, and that one only in
football. Were Hampden-Sydney a
member of the same conference as
Washington and Lee, there would
almost undoubtedly develop a rival-
ry between the two schools.

In short, it seems ridiculous that
W&L remain in the CAC when it
would be far more advantageous to
be a member of the Mason-Dixon

ed in hearing what the general stu-
'dent consensus is on this question.

About two dozen Washington and

the group. Non-athletes are not ex-

to join.

The Generals’ football coach, Lee
McLaughlin, and basketball coach,
Verne Canfield, serve as advisers.

Locally, the group makes periodic
visits to the Lynchburg Children’s
Home and members keep up “Big
Brother” correspondence with the
children. The group participates in a
program of regular physical therapy
for a mentally retarded Lexington
child in hopes he will someday learn
to crawl and walk properly and to

With the varsity lacrosse season opener next week, the

week when it was learned that
Jock Hopkins, outstanding player
on the JV last year, would be lost
for the season due to an internal
leg injury.

The Generals boast a strong start-
ing defense but it lacks depth. Ben
Gambill’s “big stick” will block many
opponents’ shots on the crease this
year, while Warren Stewart and
Lance Bendann, an All-Conference
player as a freshman last year, give

W&L two of the best defensive
stickhandlers in ‘the South. Bob
Hankey, Will Sledge, and Roger
Milam form the second defense and
have worked well together as a
unit.

Tri-captains Carroll Klingelhoffer
and Mike Michaels give the Generals
a potent pair of attackmen; both are
great stickhandlers with hard shots.
Their feeds should account for many
W&L goals this season. Duncan, La-
manote and Tom Pittman, a high
school standout from Moorestown,
New Jersey, are competing with
Reed Paynter for crease attack, Chip
Chew has been impressive in early
drills. George Stamas, Bill Jeffress,
and Paul Murphy are up from the
“B” squad to provide depth for at-
tack.

Swarthmore invades the South for
a scrimmage with the Generals next
Monday and Tuesday. A tough
Ohio State team opens the W&L sea-

;son next Thursday, and the stick-

men finish this term with a game
against Hofstra in Baltimore on

of the E.C, and stated his opinion
that “the plan will work if it gets
a chance.”

The proposed amendment was
passed without a dissenting vote
after its passage was moved by stu-
dent body vice president Jim De
Young. The five basic points of the
plan are:

1, All political parties must reg-

ister with the E.C,

2. All registered political parties
must have nominating conventions
announced at least one week be-

3. Each party must submit an
itemized list of expenditures to the
E.C,

4. The E.C, strongly discourages
unregistered parties or action
groups.

5. Law students and independent
students may register with the
party of their choice.

The E.C. also appointed a commit-
tee to screen applicants for the Gil-
liam Award. The committee will be
chaired by Jere Turner and will re-
ceive letters of application up to
April 5.

To the Editor:

My particular case has nothing at
all to do with the real issue here,
which the administration seems to
overlook. The widening protest that
the campus is now experiencing was
triggered by a single student who
thought it unfair that I should get
an “F” for a mere overcut.

It is true that he was concerned
about my individual case, and he
wrote in protest of this decision; but

Leyburn Praises

As Fine Satire

(Continued from page 2)
every boy and every gal that’s born
into the world alive is either a little
Liberal or else a little Conserva-
tive’? One must admire Lord
Countararat (who traces his ancestry
back to the Flood) as he justifies the
House of Lords by pointing out that
throughout the Napoleonic wars it
“did nothing in particular, and did
it very well.”

Every time the Lord Chancellor
appears there is a big scene. Lex-
ington’s large population of law-
vers will relish his assurance that
“the law is the true embodiment of
everything that’s excellent,” and his
requirement that Strephon back up
his elaims by producing affidavit
from a thunder-storm.

No patter-song in the whole Gil-
bert and Sullivan repertoire is more
inventive than the Lord Chancellor's
account of his nightmare, induced by
love unrequited. It is a dream in
which bieyeles, relatives (a ravenous
horde!), black silk socks, cranber-
ries, and joint-stock companies be-
come madly confused.

To have named these high mom-
ents is not to suggest that Phyllis,
the Fairy Queen, Lord Tolloller, and
the Chorus of Fairies do not beguile
us at their every appearance. The
simple truth is that there is not a
dull moment in the whole opera.

Sullivan’s music glows and spark-
les. A gay fugue announces every
appearance of the Lord Chancellor
Intricate counterpoint is tossed off
like child's play. We hear the
flageolet (or reasonable facsimile
thereof) as well as the trumpet’s
bray.

With the appearance of the Fairies

the music goes “tripping hither,
tripping thither, nobody knows
whither”; but the Peers require a

full orchestra with brasses banging
“Tzing! Boom!”

Altogether it is an_ irresistible
opera—words and music, principals
and chorus, peers and peris, Gilbert
and Sullivan.

Delacardos Are Banned
From Campus by IFC

By DAVE MARCHSE

Last night the IFC held its usual
weekly meeting. The meeting was
short as far as business goes. It
must be the mid-semester doldrums.

The first business was a proposal
by the Phi Gam Representative to
ban the Delacardoes Combo from the
Washington and Lee campus. It was
explained that although this particu-
lar combo was one of the most pop-
ular to play on our campus, that
they were frequent entertainers at
Phi Gam house, their services could
not be retained unless they returned
the articles which they took over
Fancy Dress weekend. As a result
the IFC voted unanimously in sup-
port of the motion.

The IFC then discussed the possi-
bility of having the Self-Study Sub-
committee on Fraternities attend the
IFC-Faculty Coffee with the hope
that they would bring forth questions
and suggestions about the fraternity
situation at Washington and Lee.
The Coffee has ben scheduled for
Thursday, April 8.

The Faculty Committee on Fra-
ternities as well as the fraternity
representatives will also attend. It
is hoped that the faculty and stu-
dents will be abel to arrive at a
common meeting ground in their dis-
cussion of fraternity-campus rela-
tions.

 

Carrell Report Preamble

Shows Purpose Of Reforms
The following proposal is put

forth in recognition of the fact
that a low level of student par-
ticipation in the affairs of student
government now exists. We find
this to be an unhealthy situation
in that our student government
represents those factors of life at
Washington and Lee, such as the
Honor System and conventional
dress, which draw their value from
the breadth of their support, This
proposal should be construed as a
sincere effort to strengthen our
student government and thereby
the values for which it stands by
broadening the present base of
representation. Futhermore, this
proposal should be interpreted as
an affirmation of the electoral pro-
cedure outlined in the present stu-
dent body constitution and as an
encouragement for the develop-
ment of democratically based po-
litical organization at W&L.

shifted from my own situation to
something much larger and more im-
portant.

At present some four to five hun-
dred students have signed the let-
ter—among whom are a large num-
ber of upperclassmen and campus
leaders. The majority of these people
do not know me and are hardly
concerned about by getting an “F”;
their signatures are there not to per-
suade the Absence Cominittee to re-
consider their decision but to express
strong dissatisfaction with the pres-
ent cut system itself,

lt is for this reason that you can-
not afford to discount the import-
ance of the letter and feel that you
have taken care of the problem by

 

deserved the “F”. The ruling was
not necessarily unfair, but the sys-
tem undeniably is.

or “Save John Jay” or “Steve Kes-
ter Denman,” all of whom know
first-hand the harsh penalty that
the present system holds, or it might
even read “Save Jim Kulp” and the
host of other students who have not
yet had the misfortune of overcut-
ting.

There is so much feeling, an ever-
increasing amount, among the stu-
dents and a great many faculty
members about the present system
that it seems almost certain some re-
vision wlil soon have to be made.
It does not seem likely that the sys-
tem will be done away with entire-
ly, for the faculty once tried un-
limited cuts with second semester
seniors (under the assumption that
these students were the most ma-
ture) and it resulted in too many
lowered averages to suit the faculty.

But a change in penalty is not
enough; as long as the cut sys-
tem exists in any form it will con-
tinue to be unrealistic, paternal-
istic and unreasonable. Any such
set of regulations is necessarily
based on the assumption that the
majority of students here are not
responsible enough to decide for
themselves whether or not they
should attend class and thus must
have regulations compelling them
to attend.

This may or may not be true. If
it is true then Washington and Lee
needs to do something about the
caliber of men that it is attracting,
or at least do something toward in-
creasing the responsibility of the
students here. You do not make a
person more responsible by taking
responsibility from him, and there
is surely no adequate justification for
taking this particular responsibility

sult if a leader would place himself
at the head of the people instead of
the party for unification,

Mr. Ives quoted Adam Smith in
emphasizing the importance of a
“laissez-faire” policy in government
in which the individual has a re-
spensibility in industry. He also
stressed Edmund Burke's concept of
the poltical party as a check on the
“king’s” authority.

Under the concept of “New Feud-
alism” Mr. lives indicated the emerg-
ing significance of property and par-
ty as two aspects of a curb on the
economic and political power of the
government: “no man will be absurd
enough to deny the necessity of

E

 

 

such checks and balances.”

During the panel discussion which|
followed his talk, Mr. Ives pointed
to the advantages of maintaining a
two party system; he was disturbed |
by the possibility of having just one
party emerge in control of the na-|
tional government. Along with the|
decline of property rights comes
the “return” to the original status
of medieval land tenure; manage-
ment must be given a fairly free
rein to prevent the return of the

 

 

 

ty can best be met. He pointed out
that Americans must have “sensiv-
ity” toward other countries.

Americans must be aware of what
is going on in other societies and
cultures. Miller demonstrated how,
as a result of America’s increasing
affluence, a feeling of resentment to-
ward the poor countries of the
world has arisen. “It is the role of
the American statesman to reverse
this trend,” Col. Miller stated.

Col. Miller held that mankind has
a definite destiny, and our “rendez-
vous with destiny’ can come if
America, as a representative of free-
dom under law based on representa-
tive government, fulfills its role. “All
paths lead together,” stated Col.
Miller. “We can’t graft our ways on
other societies; rather, we must help
those societies to stability by plant-
ing seeds of freedom.”
