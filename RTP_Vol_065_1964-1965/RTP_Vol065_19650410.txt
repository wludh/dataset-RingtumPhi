Jerry Worley, of Roanoke’s North
Side High, had the 73. The winning
score was an improvement on last

Editorial Cartoonist Stirs,
Borgstedt Tells SIPA Meet

By CHARLES FISHBURNE

Douglas Borgstedt, editorial car-
toonist for King Features Syndicate,
addressed a gathering of 500 high
school journalists and advisors at
Washington and Lee University here
today on “Inside Editorial Cartoon-
ing.”

A cartoonist is “not trying to put
forth any final touch of logic,” he
said, “he is a needler, a stimulator
of thought, he stirs up the pot.”

A good cartoonist, he added, should
have a sense of humor, curiosity, “a
good nose for news,” ability to ana-
lyze and simplify, an understanding
of human nature, a strong artistic
style and affinity for characteriza-
tions, and originality of ideas
Dilemma

In the past few years, he said, the
editorial cartoonists have suffered,
have been toned down as the result
of newspaper group ownership, less

Cartoonists’

“1 and less direct competition between
| papers of opposing views, the evolu-

tion of journalism into “more of a
and the
advent of television.

The biggest threat to the role of
the contemporary cartoonist is tele-
vision, he said, but this has failed
to materialize because “television
has not stood up to be counted as
an opinion-maker. The cartoonist
and the drawing board remain the

true standard bearer when it comes
to visual comment and interpreta-
tion,” he added

Borgstedt showed some of his more
recent cartoons to the group and
drew several freehand to illustrate
his techniques

Said Borgstedt, “You've got to go
for broke in drawing a cartoon; there
is no provision tor

Pennsylvania Dutch farmhouse in
Bryn Mawr, Pr., was born in West-

Borgstedt showed an early interest
in visual expression, possibly stem-
ming from his father’s work as an
engineer and draftsman. He sold his
first drawing at 12, winning first
prize of $5 in a magazine contest.
In fact, within two years, he was
discreetly asked to “retire” from
competition because he won so many
prizes in the magazine's monthly
art contests.

He was educated at the Cathedral

SIPA Formed
39 Years Ago
As Stimulant

In April of 1926, the Lee Memorial
Journalism Foundation at Washing-
ton and Lee decided to try something
new—a meeting of high school
journalists from all over the South.

A total of 76 delegates from 11
states attended that 1926 convention
By 1941, at the seventeenth annual
convention, the official registration
showed more that 500 students at-

This year there are approximately
1,000 students from eight states at-
tending the Southern Interscholastic
Press Association Convention

The continued interest and success
of the annual conventions has made

Au Revoir, Mrs. Fallwell

Ocassionally, there develops in society a person so intelli-
gent, so warm and understanding, so wonderful, that when
this individual passes away, many and varied interests mourn
the passing. Such a person was Mrs. Henriette Messager Fall-
well.

Mrs. Fallwell, who taught in the Roanoke, Virginia, school
system for 34 years, died in March. Her smile, charm, and
teaching techniques inspired countless high school students of
French during those precious three and one-half decades.

But Mrs.
her French courses. It extended to numerous other areas of
life, including publications.

While on the faculty of Jefferson Senior High School,
she founded “L’Echo de Roanoke,”’ the first foreign language
newspaper in a Virginia secondary school. The newspaper,
written and published entirely in the French language, was
frequently recognized by the Southern Interscholastic Press
Association, and by other associations, for its exceptionally
high merit.

Believing the newspaper to be a superb means of develop-
ing in her students, at the same time, -— observation, good
writing and good French, she created “La Liberte” upon
joining the faculty of Patrick Henry High School, also in
Roanoke. Both journals continue to lowsich,

Fallwell’s influence was hardly contained within

Mrs. Fallwell retired in June, 1963. With her went a large
number of awards she had won, including the Distinguished
Service Award of S. I. P. A., presented to her at the awards

Washington and Lee,
SIPA Delegate, °51

Che department of journalism and
communications, now safely en-
sconced in its four-story brick tower
called Reid Hall, is a far ery from
what it was just a few years ago.

The same professors are there, but
the facilities they now have are
vastly improved.

few years back—CBS’ Roger Mudd

rector of information services, John

days what it used to be like.

Reid Hall Renovated for Journalism

(Continued from page 2)

story, and I had always heard that
when something really BIG occur-
red—such as the attack on Pearl
Harbor or the end of World War IIl—
the bell would ring five times.

I was sitting in the library one
day, in 1954, not paying any atten-
tion to the teletype, when it sud-
denly occurred to me that I had just
heard five bells. I rushed to the ma-
chine, and read words to this effect:

“Washington, D.C. — May 17 —
(AP)—The Supreme Court today
declared the ‘separate but equal’
doctrine of school segregation un-
constitutional...”

I guess in terms of subsequent
events, that story merited five bells.

The “other room” also functioned
as a classroom and as a news room,
where the journalism students re-
turned from their “beats” and wrote
their stories. At night, the room be-
came a broadcasting studio, and the
students broadeast our stories over
the air on “Home Edition,” then as
now the only local daily news source
in Rockbridge County.

The “other room” had anothe
funetion for me. Under Washington
and Lee’s honor system, I could
easily obtain permission from pro-
fessors to take my exams in the

room, because it had typewriters in

press myself better, and quicker,
on an exam if I typed it.
Later, another nearby classroom

was converted into a broadcasting
studio. But these were the facili-
ties until the J-School moved into
its new quarters. The improvement
is obvious to anyone who takes a
short tour of the new facilities.

Lee the Pioneer

If the facilities seem archaic to
what is now present, it was even
more so in the beginning. The new
Reid Hall facilities are quite an
improvement on Gen. Lee’s original
thoughts that after the Civil War,
the South’s greatest need was
informed and competent leadership
in commerce, law and government,
engineering and public opinion.

In 1869, at Gen. Lee’s instigation,
the college offered 50 “press schol-
arships” and instruction in journal-
ism was begun. The scholarships
were to go to young men “propos-
ing to make printing or journalism
their profession.”

Maj. John J. Lafferty, editor of
a Lexington newspaper, The Virginia
Gazette, was appointed to the col-
lege faculty, and his print shop was
chosen as the “laboratory” for in-
structing the students.

Unfortunately, Gen. Lee died the
next year and the project bore
little fruit. The proposed scholar-

 

it and I always felt I could ex-

plan for journalism instruction was
dropped in 1878.

It wasn’t until 1925 that Lee’s pro-
posal was actually brought into full
reality. In that year, the Southern
Newspapers Publishers Association
endowed the Lee Memorial Journal-
ism Foundation—which flourishes to-
day in its new brickery tower.

Reid Hall was renovated for the
Department of Journalism and Com-
munications in 1963-64, 60 years
after its construction. The large
building contains 15,780 square feet
of floor space.

Floor plan of Reid Hall

The general plan of the structure
is as follows:

Ground floor—Printing laboratory
including composing room, work
folding and binding room, press room
stock room, mailing room, and office
space.

Second floor — Academic head-
quarters, including auditorium and
projection room, library, student
lounge, film library, seminar room,
library archives and storage room
and office space.

Third floor — Laboratories and
workrooms, including newsroom,
wire room, broadcasting studios A,
B, and C, control room, film editing
room, advertising laboratory, tape
library, record library, and office’
space.

Fourth floor—Photographic print-
ing rooms and darkrooms.

Riegel Welcomes SIPA Weather 5 IPA Vusztors

Professor O. W. Riegel, chairman of the Lee Memorial Journal-

the customary remarks, but he placed especial emphasis on the

weather.
He called it “SIPA weather.”

Traditionally, Riegel remarked,

Until recently Lauck also con-

department, teaching journalism stu-

Edward Backus now teaches the

Both Lauck and Backus were hos-
pitalized during the SIPA weekend,
marking the first time within mem-
ory either veteran printer had not
participated in the convention.

The temporary loss of the two
