‘Merchant of Venice’ Review

Critic Huntley Praises Troubs
For “Refreshing” Interpretation

By R. H. HUNTLEY
Professor of English

As directed by Professor Cecil Jones, the Troubadour’s Merchant of
Venice is a refreshing return to what was certainly Shakespeare's concep-
tion of the play. Shylock, for a century the captive of the
sentimentalists, becomes again the vengeful, usurious
Jew of Renaissance report. The real sense of religious
conflict between Jew and Christian, which through sub-
sequent religious indiflerentism has dwindled into egali-
tarian tolerance, comes alive for he audience.

It is historically proper that Shylock be portrayed
as the embodiment of the evil principle, the merciless
and usurious Jew of Renaissance legend, not as a tragic,
persecuted member of a religious minority. If the intol-
erant insist on viewing the play as corroboration of
their own prejudices, they are the poorer for this, not
Shakespeares art. Shylock’s pivotal line, on which
hinges the interpretation of his character, “Hath not a

purge trials of 1936-1937 which sent
one-half of the Soviet general staff

During the war he served in Intel-

Colvin said, “Brigadier Mclean
formed a long friendship with Mar-

In 1945, he returned to England

regarded as an expert on Yugoslavia
and the Soviet Union,” Dr. Colvin
stated.

Aside from his political and mili-

them are: Back to Bokhara (his most

Paternalistic Discipline

Walk into any classroom on any Saturday morning, find
at least a third of the class not in attendance, and the professor
wondering why he bothered to come, and you will ask yourself
the inevitable: Why should we have Saturday classes?

Saturday classes are marked by a singular lack of applica-
tion or academic curiosity. A lackadaisical attitude prevails,
since neither the students nor the professors themselves wanted
to be there. One is led inevitably to question the value to be
derived from these meetings.

If we did abolish Saturday classes, we would allow an un-
interrupted weekend for study and for necessary trips. We
would avoid the Sunday night study scramble and the Monday
morning dreariness resulting from the hurried weekend. If
we were to abolish Saturday classes, the inescapable result
would be that the professors would have the time necessary to
complete the discussions which they are now just getting into
when the bell rings.

Assuredly, the abolition of Saturday classes would result
in the extension of the weekend from Friday noon to Monday
morning. The responsibility of taking a W&L education ser-
iously would be left up to the student, where it originally should
have been located.

The discipline of having Saturday classes is an example of
the University’s paternalistic attitude and a witness to the lack
of confidence which they feel in the mautrity of the student.
Men, if they are to become mature, must mature by accepting
responsibility themselves, not by having it thrust upon them
by the discipline of Saturday classes.

Those who did not respond positively to this freedom
would in all probability flunk out. Many fine universities, how-
ever, do not have Saturday classes and their student bodies
seem not to have suffered from it. Instead, this freedom seems
to have evoked a greater sense of the individuals’ responsibility
to himself in attaining an education.

We shouldn’t be forced to play the role of the educational
dwarf, led to the classroom on Saturday by a paternalistic
discipline.

Brown has its Pembroke, Harvard

have their Hollins “honeys”’—or so
they think.

Once upon a time, when to be a
Washington and Lee gentleman re-
quired more than an account with J.
Press and a passport from The High
School, the Washington and Lee
monopoly at Hollins was more than
geographic. The knight of Washing-
ton Hall made their conquests by
brandishing wit, irresistable charm,
and—perish the thought—good form.
The bottle, cars and sexual bravado
were the things of knaves. But alas,
the knights took to the bottle, the
squires to emulating the knights, and
the knaves effeced a court coup.

The neighboring damsels, finding

Assistant Professor, Political Science

Bill Burke repeats the official
Goldwater line when he suggests in
his column of the 13th that Gover-
nor Rockefeller and Ambassador
Lodge could have delivered 2 or 3
Million votes to the GOP. He does
not explain nor support this propo-
sition, and I believe that insofar
as it was meant to apply to the
State of New York it is exceedingly
improbable.

It is much more probable that an
all-out Rockefeller effort for Gold-
water would have further harmed,
rather than helped, the Republican
cause in New York. Certainly such
an effort would have played into
the hands of the Democrats whose
strategy was to link Republican
candidates to “Goldwaterism”
(meaning to most New Yorkers, I be-
lieve, not racism but abandonment
of the tradition of Lincoln, not war-
mongering but flippancy about nu-
clear war, not fascism but the Len-
inist-like tactics of the Birch So-
ciety). In this regard, of course, the
New York situation was probably
not unlike that in other northern
and midwestern states (which if true

of W&L.

Fraternity hazing was condemned,
and so was conformity. The wonder-
ful heritage of our traditions was
lauded, and one columnist pointed
out that we have a precious legacy
from R. E. Lee to preserve.

Then, as now, it was obvious that

The Ring-tum Phi Presents Albee Original

The Ring-tum Phi recently received a letter and manuscript
from the playwright Edward Albee, author of Who’s Afraid
of Virginia Woolf? as well as The American Dream and The
Zoo Story. Albee was on campus during the spring of 1962
to help direct the Troubadours in their production of these
latter two plays.

Mister Friday Editor,

Enclosed within is a short
play that you might perhaps
include in your edition of
the Ring-tum Phi.

ber of the student body
could empathize with ralph

this, my minor masterpiece,
is too hot to handle, please ™ Sine

I enjoy most in life is sleeping. I really do love to sleep,
and don’t know what I'd do without it.

I reflected, once, on my great love for sleep, but it
proved too frustrating a task, and so I gave it up. The only
conclusion I had been able to come to was a ridiculous one:
that I slept so much because of the very fact that I was an

I did not want to be ordinary and average. That I wanted

but that I was a nobody—a zero, a non-entity.

But these thoughts had brought no peace to my mind, so
naturally I gave them up and went to sleep.

3-1 mark, but can do no better than
tie for the title with the winner of
the W&L-Washington game.

Washington carries a 5-3-1 mark
into its final game and is 2-1 in
conference play. The Bears lost
only to Sewanee in the CAC. Gener-
al coach Lee McLaughlin cites this
as “a real tough game.” Washing-
ton has a big forward wall, aver-
aging 210 pounds in the defensive
line, and a bevy of good backs.

With a large squad, the Bears sub-
stitute freely, using a number of
specialists. They have been suc-
cessful in defensing most opponents
although several have scored on
long runs. The Bears held Centre to
11 yards total offense, winning 28-7.

No startling changes are in store
for the WU game, although Coach
Mac indicated that his charges will
probably pass more than they did
last week when they completed four
of eight for 44 yards. The short flat
pass seems to have the best chance
of clicking, although several teams
have connected on the long bomb.

Sewanee had some success last
week running off the weak side
tackle, and the Generals will direct
a large portion of their ground at-
tack here.

Last week's 9-0 win over South-
western pleased the General mentor
in several areas although he stated
that he “didn’t come away from the|
game with any degree of satisfac-
tion.” He was particularly pleased
with the job that the pass defense
did.

With Gordon Gay leading the safe-
ties, and Starke Sydnor leading the
defensive charge, the Generals held
the Lynx to two completions in 20
attmepts for a total of one yard.
McLaughlin also cited Cary Green
for his second successful field goal
in as many games.

Riding a three-game winning
streak, the Generals have a chance
for the CAC championship and a
winning record in a year billed as
“rebuilding.”

ZBT Captures
Football Title

By JOHN BEAGLE

ZBT with a rugged defense and
an almost as sharp offense has won
the 1964 Intramural Football Cham-
pionship. ZBT did with a forfeit win
yesterday afternoon over PiKA.

But the big game was held
Wednesday afternoon between ZBT
and the SPE’s. In that game, ZBT’s
tough defense held SPE’s high scor-
ing football machine scoreless in
chalking up a 14-0 win to all but
clinch the IM championship.

ZBT on Monday has beaten KA,

 

14-6, and SPE had defeated PiKA,!

12-8. In another game, KA won over
PiKA, 14-6, and last week SPE
smashed KA, 44-0.

Final playoff standings in IM foot-
ball: 1. ZBT, 3-0; 2. SPE, 2-1; 3.
KA, 1-2; 4. PiKA, 0-3.

In wrestling, another league champ
has been decided as Phi Kap upset
Sigma Chi, 33-5, and then beat Kap-
pa Sig 20-13 to carry off the honors
in League B. Phi Psi is already in
the finals having taken the League
D championship.

SPE is almost a cinch to make the
finals with only one match left
against NFU in league C. Phi Gam
and ZBT will wrestle for the League
A crown after Thanksgiving.

In the finals pick: 1. Phi Psi, 2

Phi Kap, 3. SPE, 4. ZBT.

Washington and Lee’s_ soccer
team, kept from the state champion-
ship by a rule change, took their
first step today in their bid for
an NCAA tournament title as they
faced Norwich College of North-

Norwich, a private military col-

David Described As ‘Free Spirit’

By FRANK PARSONS
(Editor’s note: Frank Parsons,
Director of W&L’s Information
Service, recently sent a letter to
Virginia sportswriters regarding
Bill David. The following article

is derived from that letter.)

There’s a certain free spirit who
plays halfback for Washington and
Lee’s football team. Bill David is his
name, and barring none, he is prob-
ably the best pass receiver ever to
play for W&L, either in the amateur
era or the big time of more than a
decade ago.

He is also one of the most excit-
ing Generals to watch in action, on
and off the playing field.

He drives sports cars, rides a
motor bike (usually with a good-
looking blonde clutching him from
behind), and wears his hair long,
speaks in a husky voice that girls
apparently find irresistable, and can
be (as the mood strikes him) the

-| nattiest dressed of all the Generals,

or the grubbiest.

As co-captain for 1964, his relaxed
approach to football has at once
perplexed and pleased Coach Lee
McLaughlin.

On the field he gives it all he
has, and this can be considerable.

He is one of the big reasons the
General secondary has given up
only 24 pass completions to 84 op-
ponents’ attempts this year.

As a safety, he has handled 16
punts for an average of only 7.2
yards, but his manner of return has
been spectacular to say the least.
On at least three occasions he has
had long returns of over 30 yards
nullified by clipping penalties. It
seems he jigs around, starts, stops,
relaxes, doubles back, etc. until
(1) he finally gets back to about
where he started (2) he gets a sub-
stantial return and/or (3) one of

 

his frantic teammates, having time
during all this locomotion by David
to throw two or three blocks, will
get called for clipping as the law
of averages and an official catches
up with him. Same thing has hap-
where
David has returned seven for an

pened on kickoff returns

average of 18.6 yards.

David's big talent is catching a
football. He’s done it 41 times this
year for a total of 415 yards, or
better than 10 yards per catch. He’
only scored twice, but many of his
catches have been vital third down
efforts that have sustained many a
W&L drive. McLaughlin rates him
has eve
coached in college or professional
observations. David has the hands,
the moves, and almost the speed

the finest receiver he

necessary to make it in the pros.

Those 41 catches are believed to

be a W&L record. In moving the
publicity office from one place to
another on three occasions during
the past two years, some records

have been temporarily misplaced,
but it’s unlikely that anyone has

topped that mark.

Forty-one receptions is good in
any league, and just about three-
fourths of those catches came against
double and triple-teaming defenses.

I think Bill David is a great one.
It’s a pity that more of the working
press can’t cover the small colleges,
for they've missed a real treat in

this fellow.

Baby Booters Close Season
With 13-1 FUMA Win

Washington and Lee’s freshman
soccer team closed out the 1964
season yesterday afternoon with a
13-1 run-away victory over the
varsity from Fork Union Military
Academy.

Fork Union was handicapped in
the game by the absence of three
starters. W&L kept continuous pres-
sure on the Fork Union goalie. Five
5! W&L booters scored more than one
goal with Al Craig leading the list
with three. Jim Forrester, Jim Kirby,
Ben Johnson, and Bob Logan each
picked up two apiece.
ri} In a game played last Tuesday
afternoon, the W&L freshmen
fought the Augusta Military Aca-
demy varsity to a 0-0 tie. The AMA

of the rules, turned out to be in
the clear. The rule in question re-
stricted a player to three years of
elegibility in NCAA turney com-
petition only.

Coach Joe Lyles also expressed
pleasure over the relatively light
casualty list. All squad members
were expected to be able to play,
with only three men hampered by
injuries. These were hopeful All-
American fullback Dave Redmond,
forward Dave Kirkpatrick, and half-
back Fred Skinner.

Kirkpatrick, who reinjured his
separated shoulder in VISA tourna-
ment finals, appeared in good con-
dition, but the shoulder remained
a question mark. Redmond was
troubled by his recurring bruised
hip, while Skinner suffered from a
pulled muscle.

The Generals missed winning last
week’s state meet due to a new rule
which took effect only this year.
Under VISA rules if the score is
still tied after a double overtime
period a tournament game is award-
ed to the team gaining the greatest
number of corner kicks. This rule
formerly included only corner kicks
in the overtime period itself; and
under this rule Virginia had beaten
Lynchburg for the title two years in
a row.

Before this year’s tournament,
however ,the coaches had voted to
count corner kicks scored in the
whole game. And in the finals, UVa.
(which had beaten Lynchburg in the
semifinals by scoring the first cor-
ner kick in sudden death after
both goals and corner kicks were
tied) took the title away from W&L,
outdoing them 7-4 in corners de-
spite the Generals’ 2-1 advantage
in the overtime period .

Column Results Negative
(Continued from page 2)

But, curiously enough, nothing
happened.

Feddemann is still here, and so
is conventional dress; the fraternities
still have rallies, and conformity
doesn’t seem to have disappeared
entirely.

Not even the columnists have
changed. They're still trying, still |
avidly pursuing the course of the
gadfly. And we still believe in
ourselves, and know in our hearts
that we are really right.

The whole thing is kind of ridicu-
lous, isn’t it?

Being a columnist, I mean,

I guess it’s worth it, though. After
all, it’s satisfying to know Bob Payne

Hawkins Sees Pre-Election Polls
Indicating Goldwater Undertow

(Continued from page 2)

gree to which Goldwater would be
a drag in New York State.

I submit that virtually every pre-
election indicator in New York (lo-
cal polls, professional politicians,
etc.) pointed to a gigantic Goldwater
undertow. Political imperatives, in
other words, necessitated a shun-
Goldwater stategy. The results speak
for themselves, not only in New
York but also in states like Iowa
and Indiana where there was no
problem with feet-dragging liberals.

 

One strategy and one strategy alone
would have prevented the great
Goldwater undertow, i.e., the nomi-|
nation of someone else to head the
ticket. That Goldwater strategists |
were persuaded to the contrary is
merely a significant comment on the
caliber of the strategists.

apparently believed that the evi-
dence pointed to a good showing
by the leading conservative, pos-
sibly even a victory. This would
explain the Senator’s statement,
made while announcing his candi-
dacy, that he would not hourt the
conservative cause if he got forty-
five per cent of the vote.

What were the major assumptions
on which Senator Goldwater’s can-
didacy was based, and how realistic
were they in terms of existing
knowledge about American politics?
Any answer to such questions, of
course, is liable to the objection
that this or that was not in fact
a major assumption etc. However, I
believe that the following “assump-
tions” represent the views of many
if not most reputable academic and
journalistic observers. (What pro-
portion of either group is sensation-
seeking I am unable to say.) Futher-
more it is doubtful that in the ab-
sence of such assumptions Gold-
water’s candidacy would have made
sense at all.

The basic strategic assumptions
(there were also important tactical
assumptions made during the actual
campaign) were (1) that the South
was Goldwater territory (2) that the
backlash among “ethnic minorities”
in the big cities would substantially
reduce or even overcome the tra-
ditional Democratic advantage in
those key places (3) that a con-
servative candidate would bring out
the non-voter, allegedly a conserva-
tive, who was sulking over his lack
of a real choice and (4) that a con-
servative candidate could retain the
great bulk of registered Republicans
as well as the firm support of the
so-called Presidential Republicans
(i.e., the “liberals” or “moderates”).
| It will be the burden of this essay
to show that these assumptions were
extravagant and improbable, with the
exception of number 4, and that the
people making them showed no very
profound regard for the conse-

quences of the sort of debacle that
materialized.
