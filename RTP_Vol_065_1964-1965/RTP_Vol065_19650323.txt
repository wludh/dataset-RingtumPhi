Proposal N seul
Majority Vote |
For _ Adoption |

Nomination Processes |

Would Be Changed

In New Elections |
By WENDALL L. WINN |

As a result of the Executive Com-
mittee’s unanimous endorsement of a
proposed amendment to the student
body constitution which would pro-
vide extensive reform in|
connection with student elections a}
referendum will be held on Wednes-|
day from 8:15 to 5:00 in Washington |
Hall |

Under the new ae which was}
drafted by Rick Carrell after several |
students had expressed the need for|
a revised system, the campus politi-
cal parties would be required to
register with the E.C. and be pledged
to hold open primaries. Many feel
that the proposed system would be
definite improvement over the
present Clique method employed in
nominations, and if the majority of
students get behind this referendum
and vote in favor of the amendment, |
then it will go into effect in time for|
this year’s spring elections.

Carrell and Steve Smith, who
was the first to undertake the in-
itiative of introducing a possible |
plan, feel that the new system |
will meet with success with the
cooperation of the student body. |
They added that this amendment |
would contribute te the overall
stability of our political system |
and is a “positive plan of action.” |

In addition registering with |
the E.C., all political parties would}
be required to have nominating con-|
ventions announced at least a week|
prior to the election; students |
and Independents could register with
the party of their choice. Under the
proposed system, enthusiasm and

during elections would
among the students, permit-|
freer competitive spirit. The
student body would be given
opportunity to express thei:
of candidates instead of the,
nomination being dominated by one
party Clique

A majority of the students,
however, when asked their opin-
ions were not familiar with the
proposed amendment or the ap-
proaching referendum: this may
have a detrimental effeet upon the
voting Wednesday: in order for
this referendum te pass, it is neces-
sary for a majority of the Student
Body to vote affirmatively.

Mary Wells

Miss Wells, a resident of Detroit,
Michigan, became well-known na-
tionally after touring the country
with “The Motown Review” and
when her first hit, “Bye Bye Baby”
received prominence as a a hit.

Since that time, Miss Wells has
remained with the Motown group—
the same company also features Mar-

vin Gaye, the Supremes, the Im-
pressions, the Contours and many
other popular recording groups

and has recorded a bevy of national
hits such as “The One Who Really
Loves You,” “You Beat Me to the
Punch,” and her latest hit “Never
Never Leave Me.”
Dionne Warwick

“Don’t Make Me Over” and “Walk
on By” are two of Miss Warwick's
greatest hits. This blues singer began
her career with the recording of
“Anyone Who Had a Heart” and has
been international every since, hav-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che King-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Tuesday Edition

 

Tomorrow’s Referendum

For the past three weeks the Ring-tum Phi has expressed
concern for the political climate of this University. Even more
important that this we have presented a Fair Election Plan
which has received the endorsement of the Executive Commit-
tee. Tomorrow the proposal will be presented to the student
body for final ratification. Once again we wish to urge the adop-
tion of this innovation primarily because we feel the welfare of
student government hangs in the balance.

The new proposal is certainly not without its difficulties and

so-called impracticabilities, and yet we believe that the main-|")

tenance of superior student government demands a healthy po-

litical order. The existing system threatens the traditions of our |)
University not only because it contributes to a lack of student!)

support, but because it promotes apathy toward the quality
of student leadership.

To those who would say the clique system is the guardian
of responsible leadership, we would point out that the wisdom
and maturity of this student body is quite capable of selecting
its own representatives. The elitist theory of politics which has
so often been championed by adherents of the status quo dem-
onstrates a fundamental distrust of the ability of students to
exercise intelligent political choice. Admittedly, there have
been cases in which student elections degenerated into a ridicu-
lous sham, but this was due in part, we believe, to the isolation
of the vast majority of students from any real voice in the selec-
tion of candidates.

At the time this Fair Election Plan was presented to the
Executive Committee every effort was made to encourage those
who opposed the change to justify the present system or to
introduce some alternative plan. It is particularly significant
that when the EC met to consider the proposal not one spokes-
man for its opposition took the time or interest to present their
views before the open hearing. This fact alone illustrates the
difficulty in formulating a creditable defense of a corrupt sys-
tem.

The recent referendum on conventional dress conducted
by the Assimilation Committee was singularly unsuccessful
in stimulating a large turn-out at the polls. If such be the case
in tomorrow’s referendum, the possibility of meaningful reform
will slip away. A failure to elicit any response from a high per-
centage of students will simply underscore the deterioration of

political responsibility on this campus. The evil which this new |i
proposal is trying to eliminate may well be the force which de- |,

feats it.

Tomorrow's referendum offers to the student body an op-|#

portunity to broaden the base of campus politics, and at the
same time maintain the essential high calibre of leadership. Cer-
tainly the possible rewards of this change demand that we give
it every consideration. The price of clique-dominated politics
may well be the extinction of responsible student leadership
which i nturn undermines the institutions and indeed, the her-
itage of this University.

CONTACT: A Limited Experience

In light of the recent evaluation of CONTACT given the
IFC by Blaine Brownwell, there are several aspects of the pro-
gram which deserve critical attention. The enormous amount of
time and effort which the Steering Committee devoted to the
planning and presentation of CONTACT deserves the applause
of the entire university. Yet, the overall impact of the sympo-
sium leaves much to be desired.

The lack of student participation is perhaps the most ob-
vious indication that CONTACT failed to stimulate the inter-
est of a vast majority of students. This is due not so much to
a generally apathetic student body, but rather to the limited
range of topics and speakers on the program. Instead of being
a truly intellectual symposium offering a wide variety of speak-
ers and subjects, the weekend consisted of a series of lectures
centered around the theme of contemporary politics.

The content of the talks often avoided or omitted the con-
troversial and crucial issues of today concentrating on the
‘official line’ characteristic of government spokesmen. As a
result, the panel discussions and questions were some what
superficial, although most any topic would be considered rele-
vant to the “American Experience.”

In all fairness it should be noted that Dr. Silver was an
exception to the preceding comments concerning the topics
and speakers of the CONTACT program. His remarks were
timely and certainly controversial, even though his presenta-
tion could stand improvement. Dr. Silver dealt with an aspect
of the American Experience which has particular relevance for
the University community,

A Tale of Brave Men and Exotic Adventure

 

By ARTHUR McBLAIR CROWLEY
It was almost eight thirty in the
morning. The crowded classroom was
silent: watches re-
peatedly checked,
the professor ner-
vously grinding
out his cigarette,
eyes on the wall
clock, whispering.
Eight thirty: the
door swinging
shut, stopping
with a click. Roll
call. All present
but one. The pro-
fessor slowly ar-
ranged his notes, waiting until the
last possible minute. Then he began
to lecture.

“Gentlemen, last time we were dis-
cussing the Deuteronomic—”

It was impossible to pay attention
Everyone was staring at the empty
seat, asking the same question, get-
ting the same answer: Glen “BoBo”
Orbes was absent.

Had Glen “BoBo” Orbes overslept?
Had Glen “BoBo” Orbes purposely
eut class? Had Glenn “BoBo” Orbes
gone to D.C.? The complex admin-
istrative machinery of Ampersand
swung into operation.

From his office on the second floor
of Arnold Hall, Hugo Rodriguez,
Dean of Students, dispatched a terse
note to assistant Dean Bunny Snipes:

FIND GLEN “BOBO” ORBES

GIVE F,

Two days before and six thousand,
eight hundred miles away, Glen
“BoBo” Orbes, forty six fifths of
three dollar Canadian Club strap-
ped to his sweat-soaked body, wiped
the blade of his machete on his
white ducks and turned to Musinga,
his Bantu guide:

“How much farther, Musanga?”

The native cocked his football head
to one side, then flashed a tooth-
less grin and pointed. “Not far
Bwana. Wahima village.”

“Is there a trave lagency or police
station there?”

“No know,” Musinga muttered.

The village came into view: a
cluster of irregularly spaced thatched
huts. Orbes and Musinga entered the
clearing.

“Welcome to our village.” A tall
man dressed in red and white par-
rot feathers stepped out into the
sunlight from one o fthe larger
huts. “I am Bubanza, king of the
Wahima. Please accept my cordial
invitation to spend a few pleasant
hours before resuming your jour-
ney.”

“Thanks, chief.” Orbes, greatly re-
lieved, began setting his Canadian
Club bottles in the shade. “You
know, you speak pretty good Eng-
lish.”

The chieftain smiled and ran his
hands over the colorful parrot feath-
ers. “N.C. State, '54.”

“Yeah? Orbes, Ampersand U., 68.

 

behind one of the huts emerged two

 

Pretty fat place you got here too.
You wouldn’t have a travel agency
or a police station somewhere around
here would you?”

“Ah. So you like our village. Per-
haps you would care to examine it
more closely?”

“You bet the ranch I would!”

“The ranch?”

“Yeah. Ranch. It all looks like
gravy ‘to me, Say, you wouldn't have
a travel agent...”

“I think you will be especially in-
terested in our educational system.
I believe that yours, in many re-
spects, is patterned on our own.”

“Huh?”

“Come. You will see.”

Bubanza led Orbes to the opposite
end of the village where they came
upon an outdoor classroom, flat rocks
serving as desks, all facing a grassy
hill.

“The Buru, or professor, lectures
from atop that mound. All Buru
who receive Strangaga or tenure, are
buried there according to tribal cus-
tom.”

Suddenly, Bubanza was interrupt-
ed by loud squeals of terror. From

running figures: one, a boy of about
eight years—the other a man, naked
but for a huge devil mask. The

small of his back, and the witch-
doctor, using a sharp rock, began

By dictionary definition, progress
means an onward course, a jour-
neving forward, gradual betterment,
the progressive development and
evolution of mankind as a process.

Therefore, progress would appear
to be meaningful and desirable. The
urge to better
ourselves, to bet-
ter the past, to
bring about tri-

 

umphs over the
world’s ills — be
they social, eco-

nomic, or politi-
' cal~is a worthy
and important
motivation that
should enlist the
De Young talents of those

best equipped to
cure the troubles that we face today.

Governments which once devoted
their time and energies to doing
things for people they could not
do for themselves, are now immersed
in cradle-to-the-grave security and
provide a crushing form of welfare-
ism which discourages individual in-
centive.

Consider the United States. At
the moment, present and recom-
mended public services call for larg-
er expenditures than we pay for
national defense which now con-
sumes more than half of the federal
budget. Is this progress?

For those of us who are concerned

   

DeYoung Seeks Progress, Not Progression

with individual responsibility, we
wonder how much “progress” we
can stand in terms of the surging
all-powerful federal establishment.

Is it progress to watch our pre-
cious gold reserve dwindle away to
a 26 year low while our government
refuses to take stern measures that
would almost immediately correct
the imbalance of payments?

Is it enough for Washington to
ask businessmen to reduce foreign
lending and expenditures and has
there been any specific proposals
for increasing the price of money
in the American market in order
to keep capital at home?

How do we explain the continu-
ance of foreign aid at levels when
governments abroad now owe the
United States more than $37 billion
in legal debts incurred during the
two world wars and postwar periods?
It is not these very debtor nations
that are now rich with gold piled
high?

How can we progress when our
country has really avoided any self-
imposed monetary disciplines? We
must realize that the American dol-
lar is both a domestic and world
currency. We can not afford to
shun foreign demands for gold in
exchange for U.S. dollar balances.
The acceptability of our currency
in world commerce will disappear.

We have to take in consideration
the effect it will have if we reneg
on our gold guarantee. We can not

 

 

delude ourselves into thinking that
dollars can be used in payment of
our international trade balance.
One of our troubles stems from the
fact that we have been flooding
the free world with dollars in the
last fifteen years, At the moment,
members of the common market
are suggesting further demands
for U.S. gold unless the U.S. quick-
restores its financial house. Even
the most complacent observer
must recognize the very real dan-
ger inherent in the relentless
buildup of foreign dollar claims,
the rising calls on our gold, and
the mounting arrogance of nations |
whose economies and currencies |
have been rebuilt with our dollars.

How can we at the same time
compliment ourselves on our great
prosperity while so many of the
world’s great monetary experts see
trouble ahead for us.

President Johnson as the originator
of the Great Society has called upon
students to ‘work and sacrifice and
even dare’ in the Great Society. He
has said that this is not the genera-
tion for a sheltered and uneventful
life. But as the Wall Street Journal
has said, “At every turn, almost
every day, some fresh proposals for
sheltering the individual, for ruth-
lessly degrading the value of work-
and sacrificing and daring.”

Certainly the President's war on
crime is desirable. But how can it

What makes all this rebellion . . . Necessary?

 

By ROY TYLER
Tuesday Columnist

The call has gone out from dis-
gusted professor and restless fresh-
men that Washington and Lee stu-
dents get off their
apathetic back-

sides and have a

protest riot or
something like
tha.t.

Several proles-

fessors have crit-
icized the student
body for not hav-
ing enough nerve
to question
source of authori-
ty. They do not,
say exactly what “authori-
ty” should be questioned. It is not
the authority of the professors, nor
administrative power

Tradition Questioned
The authority most eritized seems
to be the authority of tradition. Tra-
dition, the erities say, is almost al-
ways unjustified. The only justifiea-
tion for the existence of tradition
has to be that it gives the college

freshman something to protest

ever, is why all of this is necessary?
| What makes all of these rebellion
land rioting necessary for a well-
i balanced college career?

| The immediate answer will, of
jcourse, be that it would put an end
jto the growing apathetic frame of
imind ef the student body, which is
ever so obvious.

But why must the student body,
iwith emphasis naturally on the
freshman have to march
around the campus protesting tra-
dition? Why is it absolutely neces-
sary that the honor system, frater-
nities, and conventional dress be the
objects of protest?

class,

Orthedex protests take the form
of rebellion against tradition, but in
this is found a sort of conformity
within non-conformity. Non-con-
formity, or individual emphasis, can-
not follow any set pattern of be-
| havior.

Non-Conformity

In other words, the beatnik non-
conformist who must look like all
other beatniks ie even less of an
individualist than the ivy leaguer
who follows the style. In this, non-
conformity is conformity

li these who wish to see a litile

 

enthusiasm on campus would really
like to see something unusual, why
not a surge of support for tradition?
If something like conventional dress
should be maintained, why must it
be changed to prove we are not be-
ing apathetic?

The current protest against the
honor system is a prime example.
Several rather starry-eyed humani-
tarlans on campus feel that a student
who lies, cheats, or steals is merely
a vietim of unfortunate circum-
stances, They then attempt to enlist
aid by seeusing those who do not
join them of being apathetic.

Not a Dolt

But I do not join them and I am
not apathetic about a change in the
honor system. Any lessening of the
penalties would lead to a lessening
of the effectiveness of the system

I will therefore, in my own way,
protest; and I will challenge any
person to call me apathetic. Those
who accuse the student body of lack-
ing enthusiasm should make sure
their criticism is not a little “off-
hbuse ”

amid hysterical shrieks of pain.

“My God! What’s going on?” Orbes
started toward the struggling figures,
but was restrained by Bubanza.

“Do not interfere. You are observ-
ing our Perferri, or ‘cut system,’ in
operation.”

“Cut system?”

“Yes. The child has evidently
missed a class because of negligence
or simple misconduct, and now must
pay the price. As you can see, for
each cut, an ear is severed from the
head, therefore allowing the ordi-
nary student two cuts per semester.”

“But what happens when a stu-
dent takes more than two cuts?”

Being completely deaf, and

therefore useless, he is dropped
from the class with a Dorek, or
F, and begins training to become a

your system works in a slightly
different manner, but with amaz-
ingly similar results.”

“Say, chief, that reminds me. You
wouldn’t happen to have a travel

around this joint, would you? I
need a few frogskins to pay for my

Briggs: French
Film At Lyric
Well Composed

By WARD BRIGGS

Presently at the Lyrie is a Freneh
film, Les Liaisons Dangeureses, star-
ring Jeanne Moreau, Gerard Phil-
ippe, and directed by Roger Vadim,
original screener of that classic And
God Created Woman, which you will
remember won the Anatomy Award
in 1959.

The screenplay is an adaptation of
the novel of the same name written
by an impecunious French artillery
officer named Choderlos Laclos, in
1782. The book—and the film—try to
analyze the psychology of love, or
rather seduction, with what is in
both the literary and film word,
scandalous impunity. At its publi-
cation, of course, it was greeted as
an outrage by the society it beth
criticized and depicted, and con-
comitant with its initial seorn, vili-
fication and denouncement sold out
its entiring printing within two
weeks. It was bought by young men
as a guidebook to more elegant se-
duction and young women read it
behind locked doors. A bound copy,
with the author's name discreetly
erased, was found in the library of
Marie Antoinette.

The novel consists in an exchange
of letters between eight characters,
of whom the two principal are Mar-
quise de Merteuil and Viscount Val-
mont. These two lovers make a pact
between themselves, forbidding jeal-
ousy and allowing complete sexual
freedom. Each is free to take separ-
ate lovers, on the condition that the
pleasures of seduction be never al-

Adams Hits Amendment

To the Editor:

While improvements in the pres-
ent campus political system are
urgently needed, I do not feel that
the proposals which are up for refer-
endum vote will previde a solution
to the problem or even a significant
improvement of the present system

Look at the five points of the pre-
posal. The first requires that each
“party” register, and thus it merely
“legitimizes” the clique system. The
third point, which requires each
party to submit to the EC a list af
expenditures, is & Useless require=-

(a5 there

By TOM CARPENTER

Last week’s column has not drawn
too many comments thus far. One
student said, “It looks dull. I don’t
think T’ll bother reading it.” An-
other warned that the faculty and
administration did not take kindly
to articles attacking their pride and
joy, the CAC. A third agreed with
the column and said that he had
intended to write a letter to the edi-
tor,
now.

Several athletes playing spring
sports have been overheard com-
plaining about the lack of adherence
to training rules that has been dis-
played by some of their teammates
One athlete, who sticks to the regu-
lations set down by his coach, said
the he would not turn anyone into
the coach because he believed that
other violators would be escaping
scot free. Why should one man suf-
fer when others who deserve pun-
ishment do not receive any? He
seemed to accept in a philosophical
manner the fact that training regu-
lations would be broken no matter
what happened.

The baseball team looks like it
will win more games than usual this
year. Coach Lyles has two strong
pitchers in Chris Wigert and Pete
Heumann, a fair catcher in Tom
Crenshaw, and a solid collection of
infielders and outfielders. The in-
field of Ship Chase on first, either
Mike Saunders or Larry Perreault
at second, Dave Kirkpatrick at short,
and Eric Sisler at third. Sisler, who
ineligible last year, was the
leading hitter on the club as a fresh-
man two years ago. The outfield
will consist of Ashley Allen, Gordon
Gay, and Jim Crothers. Allen and
Crothers expected
the team with most of its long ball
hitting, although Wigert led the
team in RBI's two years ago while
playing in only half the games. Lyles
is so enthusiastic over his hitters
that he is reputed to have told his
club that opposing pitchers will have

apparent does not plan to do this, so
why require the parties to submit
such a list of expenses? So the EC
can file them away? There is no
valid reason for this pcint. As far as
the fourth and fifth points, the EC
merely “discourages” splinter fact-
ions and “suggests” full campus par-
ticipation. This is nothing new. The

a literary alibi for an exhibitionist

depend on your views of “morality,”

For as the movie begins, we read:

A message of importance to sophomore men

if you've got what it takes
to be an Army Officer
you may qualify for this new

on-campus training program

A new Army ROTC program starts this

coming Summer for sophomore men who apply
prior to May 1—only 3,000 applicants to be accepted

If you're a sophomore now attending one of the 247 colleges and universities that
offer Army Officer training—or you plan to transfer to one of these schools next
Fall—you may qualify for the new two-year Army ROTC program.

This new program—designed especially for college men who have not taken
Army ROTC during their first two years—will commence with six weeks of
field training this coming Summer, beginning June 14. Then you'll have
on-campus training during your junior year . . . six additional weeks at camp
during the following Summer . . . and more on-campus training during your
senior year. Even flight training is offered at some schools.

ROTC training is really a process of learning to organize and direct others—

to be a leader. Consider how important this ability can be to you throughout life;
yet, to acquire it you will spend relatively little time in the ROTC classroom.
You'll obtain valuable junior management experience . . . a fuller and richer
campus life . . . extra spending money ($40 per month during your junior

and senior school years, and even more during Summer training) . . . and,

when you graduate, an Army Officer’s commission as Second Lieutenant.

Then you'll normally spend two interesting years on active duty, often

abroad with opportunities for travel.

Talk to the Professor of Military Science on your campus about this
opportunity. Ask him to describe this new short program in detail.

Or send in the coupon below for complete information. There's no obligation
involved, and you'll not be subjected to any “hard sell” recruiting effort.
The kind of men the Army wants can decide for themselves if this new
opportunity is right for them.
