sponsored jointly by the Parents’ Ad-
visory Council and Washington and
Lee University, will take place here
on October 30 and 31 and November 1.

Invitations have been sent out to
all parents of W&L students and as of
yesterday 885 parents had registered

ready larger than the attendance at
last year’s weekend. A total of 185
guests have also accepted invitations
for the weekend.

Registration and Appointments

Parents’ weekend activities begin
on Friday afternoon and run through
Saturday night. The Friday program
begins with registration and includes
faculty appointments, which must be
made in advance by the students.
There will also be campus tours, a
meeting of the Parents’ Advisory
Council, and a weekly Chemitsry
Seminar on Friday afternoon.

Friday evening there will be a num-
ber of faculty-student programs, giv-
en in an attempt to provide a picture
of the diversity of the academic and
extracurricular programs at W&L.
These will be followed by a reception
held by President and Mrs. Cole in
Evans Hall.

Report to Parents

On Saturday time will again be set
aside for parent-faculty conferences,
and guided tours of the campus. At
eleven a.m. the “Report to Parents”
will be given in Doremus Gymnas-
jum. Speaking for this occasion will |
be Jim Kulp, president of the student
body; Dr. William Pusey, Dean of the
College; Dr. Fred C. Cole, President of
the College, Dean Edward C. Atwood,
Jr., Dean of Students; and Dean James
D. Farrar, Director of Admissions.
Dean Lewis W. Adams of the School
of Commerce and Administration and
Dean Charles P. Light of the Law
School will also speak. The afternoon
will be taken up by a buffet luncheon
and a varsity football game against
Bridgewater. A Saturday night Glee
Club concert in the gymnasium will
officially mark the end of the well-
planned weekend of activity.

It is the expressed hope of the Coun-
cil and the University that the par-
ents and guests will, through their vis-
it, be able to develop a better under-
standing of Washington and Lee and/

FRESHMEN STOP CLIQUE

Nash And Saunders In Run-Off;
Heinzerling Is Law EC Winner

By FRANK L. FAIRCHILD, JR.
Staff Reporter
Failing to receive the needed 133 majority in last night’s
election, the University Party’s nominee, Richard Nash, and
an independent candidate, Steve Saunders, have gone into a

run-off for freshman EC.

The final count last night gave Nash 111 votes against
Saunder’s 83 votes. Placing third, Jody Kline, the Liberty

Party’s choice,
while John Reynolds, another inde-
pendent candidate, polled 31 votes.
The Nash-Saunders run-off was an-
nounced for Thursday

Law Elections

Also in campus elections last
night, the election of officers for
the freshman class of the Law
was held in Tucker Hall.
The final tally of votes gave John
Heinzerling a victory over Louis
MacNeace by a count of 26-21 in
the contest for freshman Law repre-
sentative on the Executive Commit-
tee.

Additional results showed that
Roscoe Reynolds was elected Presi-
dent of the freshman Law Class,
while Herbie Smith was selected
Vice-President and Joe Logan was
chosen Secretary-Treasurer.

Freshman Speeches

The freshman election took place
at 7:30 p.m. in Evans Dining Hall
last evening under the direction of
student body President Jim Kulp.
Each candidate, preceded by a brief
nominating speech, was allowed five
minutes to express his feelings re-
garding his personal intentions and
qualifications for the office of fresh-
man Executive Committeeman.

Tommy Baremore, speaking first,
nominated ZBT pledge Steve Saun-
ders for the office. Enumerating his
candidate's qualifications, Baremore
stated that Saunders has served as

| co-editor-in-chief of his high school

newspaper The Oracle, Chief Justice
| of his school’s student court, and
governor of the New York District
of Key Club International. He also
cited Saunders’ activities here at
W&L which include participation in
the Young Republicans, membership
in the U.C.A., and chairmanship of
the W&L Civil War Round Table.

Saunders’ Talk
Candidate Saunders emphasized
that he felt there were two main is-
sues in the election: (1) the degree
of qualification of the candidates,

| and (2) the political system of Wash-

ington and Lee. Verbally
ton Churchill's statement:
have so few fooled so many for so
long.”

lashing

“Never |

received 36 votes™

 

He emphasized his qualifica-_

tions and conclused by expressing a
desire to serve the freshman class as)

i

a member of the Executive Commit-_

tee Saunders placed third in the"

 

preferential poll conducted by the

editors of the Ring-tum Phi last
week.
Dave Doughtery nominated the

University Party’s Candidate Rich-
ard Nash. Listing the nominee’s
qualifications, Doughtery stated that
Nash was vice-president of his sen-
ior class in high school, a member
of the National Honor Society, and
a varsity football and baseball play-
er. At Washington and Lee, Nash
is president of his pledge class, a
member of the Dance Board Advis-
ory Committee, and a member of the
recently established Food Control
Committee. Dougherty further stated
that Nash’s entire campaign had
been organized by members of the
freshman class.

Richard Nash

Richard Nash, a Beta pledge, said
that the main issue of the campaign
was the sincerity and responsibility
of the individual aspirants. He en-
couraged the freshmen not to vote
for or against a political party, but
rather to consider the personal qual-
ifications of each candidate. Nash
placed fourth in the preferential poll.

Reaction to the election results
was mixed. Commenting on the out-
come, Richard Nash stated: “I would
like to thank everbody who voted
for me in this election. I urge all
those who voted for me this eve-
ning as well as those who didn’t, to

| vote for me in the run-off Thursday

morning.”
Adams Comments

Liberty Party spokesman Patton
Adams summarized his feelings re-
garding the results of the election.
“First, I think the election shows
that the new University Party isn’t
as united as it thought it would be.
Secondly, it re-inforces the fact that
the political system of this campus,
as it now stands, has to go through
a full re-evaluation to see if it really
is the best system. Thirdly, I think
it is an election in which fraternities
played a smaller part than usual.

“If you compare the campaigns of
Nash and Saunders, I think you
would have to say that freshmen had
a louder voice in this election. Per-
haps, this indicates a trend. This
may be a reaction against the type
of system, or against the new Party
and the underhanded, wornout way
in which it was formed.”

The First W&L Primary

In what was essentially a primary election
last night, the freshman class nominated two
men to run for the office of Freshman Execu-
tive Committeeman next Thursday: Richard
Nash, the Clique candidate, and Steve Saun-
ders, an independent.

The difference in backing between these
two candidates is the decisive factor in the
election. It is the difference between a nomina-
tion by party bosses and one by popular de-
mand. It is true that Saunders appears, on the
basis of his record, to be the better “qualified”
of the two men; and it is true that Saunders
has out-campaigned Nash and has done so on
his own—unlike Nash. Moreover, at least two
of the candidates who did not make the run-
off favor Saunders over Nash. But outweigh-
ing these factors is another: a vote for Nash
is a vote for domination by the Clique; a vote
for Saunders is a vote for a free primary sys-
tem by which the student body will finally be

able to nominate its own candidates.

There have already been pompous threats
from fraternities in attempts to force straight-
party voting. But pressure itself will probably
convince the freshmen not to let the Clique
dictate to them. If the movement which has
carried Saunders this far can elect him, it will
be a serious blow to party pettiness and cha-
canery. If this movement puts Saunders into
office, we believe that a man will have been
elected who is exceptionally competent and
eager to serve; and that Saunders will not be
another “disappearing” freshman EC repre-
sentative.

 

Ignoring The Issues

History was made in a frighteningly rapid
whirl last week. But as the world moved from
one major news event to another, Barry Gold-
water failed, as usual, to keep up. In the
Soviet Union two leaders relatively unknown
to the free world replaced Nikita Khrushchev,
a known quantity, who had led the Communist
world through a softening of east-west ten-
sions. In Great Britain, a weak Labor Party
took over from the Conservatives on a cam-
paign which promised to withdraw much coop-
eration from the U.S. in the defense of the
free world against Communists. And in Red
China an atomic device was detonated to un-
derline the threat posed by the Chinese.

Mr. Goldwater, however, had little to say
about all this. During his campaign he has
had little enough to say on foreign affairs,
but his failure to meet these latest questions is
especially disappointing. The Senator has of-
fered no answers, affords no reasons why the
American people should vote out an exper-
ienced leader and put into office a new one. We
could expect as outspoken a man as Mr. Gold-
water to point to last week’s events and show
exactly how he would have met each crisis; but
the Senator is surprisingly silent. President
Johnson, on the other hand, has given the
people every reason for continued confidence
in him in several statements on the recent
changes.

Perhaps Senator Goldwater is silent on
world affairs because he realizes that they
hurt his candidacy. If the Soviets have retired
Khrushchev at the behest of leaders who favor
more aggressive policies toward the west, as
seems likely, should this country take the bit
in its teeth and put Goldwater in office because
he too favors a more aggressive policy in in-
ternational relations? Our interests would be
much better served by sticking with the steady
Johnson-Kennedy policies. It would be sense-
less in this situation to imagine that peace
could be better preserved by a leader with
Goldwater's uncompromising attitudes than by
a man of Johnson's political genius.

The British changeover from Tory to
Labor government is a peculiarly unfriendly
one to Mr. Goldwater. Like all our European
allies, the British are strongly inclined against
Goldwater, and if he were elected he would
face terrific problems in establishing good re-
lations with the new Labor administration. Yet
this is precisely the time when we need a pres-
ident able to work closely with the British,
because of their increasing reluctance to join
in North Atlantic defense. Now is the time
for a firm hand on relations with England—
not the hand Senator Goldwater has shown us.

The explosion of a nuclear device by the

Red Chinese presents another problem which
Mr. Goldwater appears ill-equipped to handle:
as an atomic power, Red China will seem
even more qualified to be recognized in the
world diplomatic councils. But Mr. Goldwater
seems to be adhering (for once) to his strong
determination to have no dealings at all with
the Red Chinese. His comments on the re-
cent developments have been centered on the
evils of trade with the mainland Chinese,
which is hardly the basic question. The John-
son administration, though not ready to rec-
ognize the Red Chinese, has at least made
progress toward a framework for dealing with
them realistically.

Everywhere he has gone, the Republican
nominee has hammered on the theme of the
Bobby Baker scandal; it is reported that he
considers this his best campaign issue. So far,
Bobby Baker has indeed been his best issue.
But whether the voters will be convinced that
this is a more important issue than our rela-
tions with the Russians, British, and Chinese,
is doubtful. Mr. Goldwater has also spoken
forthrightly and effectively on some domestic
issues, but more than this has to come from a
presidential candidate. He must give evidence
of a certain ability to deal with a world situa-

tion of increasing complication and delicacy.,

Mr. Johnson has proved willing to face the
fact of this complication, this delicacy, and to
bear the burden of seeming often unwilling
to give the “right” answer to embarrassing
questions.

Senator Goldwater continues to give simple
answers which are not real solutions. He will
not, he says, deal with the Communists, he
will not tolerate increasing presidential pow-
er; he spoke out most notably last week in
favor of school prayers, “moral leadership,”
and freedom of association. His arguments ate
sometimes powerful ones, but the Senator is
ignoring the even more powerful considera-
tions of international relations. More and
more Mr. Goldwater convinces us that we must
place our confidence in Lyndon Johnson, who
has shown himself able to understand and to
deal with problems of an age which demands
a strong president and a skillful negogiator.

 

“Time For A Change”

With all the deans, assistant deans, asso-
ciate deans, and faculty members who play
handball, we could expect the handball courts
to be kept in the peak of condition. Some-
how, though, they are continually in a state
of disrepair which is more befitting the ruins
of Liberty Hall than handball courts which
are in almost constant use. Whereas the cam-
pus grass is raked over with a fine-tooth comb
and enough fences are placed around the lawn
to turn the campus into a labyrinth, the hand-
ball courts languish in neglect. If just a little
of all this effort were turned toward the courts,
the results would be more than gratifying to
the high percentage of students and elite
faculty members who play handball.

Handball is Washington and Lee’s own
peculiar “national sport,” played by everybody
from the President to aspiring faculty mem-
bers to student gym classes. This is just what
makes it so amazing to find holes in the walls,
piles of plaster in the corners, doors without
latches or handles, and faulty lighting. Things
are actually so bad that players often lose
handballs through the holes in the walls, or
are trapped inside the courts because the doors
have no handles for opening from the inside.
Perhaps these conditions are suffered because
somebody later collects the lost balls for resale.
But the howling which is put up by the typ-
ically infuriated trapped handball player
should become insufferable in time and per-
haps will soon drive the coaches to ask that
repairs be made.

Of course the most basic problem of the
handball courts 15 the same which dominates
Washington and Lee's entire athletic program:
we need new facilities. When (7?) the new
gym is built, hopefully many more handball
courts will be included in the plans; and hope-
fully the new courts will be kept in such con-
dition that they will not become a menace to
the life and limb of their users. Meanwhile,
the Ring-tum Phi urges that action be taken
promptly to prevent the present handball
courts from falling into disuse because of ne
glect. We have one fine ruin already, Liberty
Hall; we don't need any more.

 

Gee! At this rate I'll have 52% by next July!

 

Mystery

Over Khrushchev’s Fall

Brings Varying Interpretations

By GARETH ADEN

“Mister K ... he dead.”
Joseph Conrad
Heart of Darkness

No one around here seems to
know where ex-premier Nikita
Khrushchev is, but everyone is will-
ing to make predictions about the
coup last week.

One thing is for sure, the change
in the Russian government took the
whole world by surprise. At first
it was not clear whether Khrush-
chev had retired or had been forced
out of office, as the official statement
claimed. He had spoken of retiring
before and the man that was official-
ly to succeed him as first party sec-
retary was his hand-picked succes-
sor, Leonid Brezhnev. Later, how-
ever, when Pravda denounced
Khrushchev with nasty remarks and
when Mr. K’s son-in-law was ousted

 

 

 

Letters to the Editor

as editor of Isvestia, the government
paper, it was obvious that someone
gave Mr. Khrushchev his walking
papers.

lhe big questions being asked now
are: Why was Khrushchev ousted?
Will Brezhnev and Kosygin last in
power (especially as a team)? Will
Soviet foreign policy towards the
West and Communist China change?

Among the reasons most generally
being accepted in the West (most

gleaned from between the lines of|
are |

Pravda and Isvestia articles)
that 1) Khrushchev had not been
able to control the Sino-Soviet split
with Red China 2) Mr. K. had tried
to create a cult of personality,
smacking of the Stalin days 3) he
had not shown dignity worthy of his
position—like pounding his shoes
in the U.N. 4) He was not able to
solve Soviet agricultural problems

Accommodation Gives Reds Win;
James On Mud And Barf Cocktail

Dear Editors:

i

In the editorial column of the|
October 6 Ring-tum Phi was pre-|
sented an idea which is sharing pop- |
ularity in this country and which is)
abhorrent to me. This is the idea that
this nation must endeavor to “ac-
commodate” the forces of commun-
ism.

If the concept of accommodation
becomes an accepted and sanctioned
American policy, it will precipitate
America’s downfall. The world is en-
gaged in a battle between two in-
compatable ideologies, and, since
1917, we have seen that the com-
munist ideology does not “accommo-
date” or “compromise.”

If in this battle we appease and
accommodate, we will suffer only
defeat for the sake of bare existence
The communists gain a major victory
at each instance of our accommoda-
tion, for through our cooperation
and appeasement they gained control
of Eastern Europe, China, Laos,
Cuba, and much of Africa. Where-
ever we have refused to accommo-

 

date (and unfortunately this has
been seldom), we have won—in
Lebanon, Greece, Guatamala, and
to an extent, Cuba

The kind of accommodation de-
sired by Johnson and Humphrey
would be disastrous. For example,|
it would be possible for a treaty)

to de-

an executive agreement
liver our jurisdictional rights to the
World Court, and, using a provision
of Article V1 of the Constitution, this
treaty would void of the
Constitution which contradict it
This idea is actively promoted by the)
ADA and Humphrey. At the
clusion of such a “deal” where would
our Bill of Rights be? Under whose!

Thus I question the validity of
the intelligence of any program of
accommodation. If the world is to
be saved from the ravages of col-
lectivism and control, our system
mut not be compromised.

The removal of one integral ele-
ment, such as any one section of
the Bill of Rights, through accom-
modation will effect the ruination of
the individualistically society.

5) Khrushchev generally lost the
confidence of party leaders.

George F. Kennon in a column
in the Washington Post warned
against exaggerating the importance
of the overthrow in the Kremlin.
Kennon felt that the switch was
basically brought on by pressure
from the Chinese-Soviet split. The
only way the Moscow leaders could
see of beginning a_ reconciliation
was to sacrifice Khrushchev as a
peace offering.

The New York Times has stated
that if the Kremlin does not make
more clear why Mr. Khrushchev
was forced to resign, there is a good
chance that a pro-Khrushchev bloc
will further split the Communist
world. A number of Russian satel-
lites have already requested a fur-
ther explanation.

In an attempt to get a wider view
of the situation, I talked to a num-
ber of professors on campus about
the developments. Dr. Milton Colvin,
political science professor, said that
the free world is going to miss old
Khrushchev in the next few years.
The reason, Dr. Colvin explained,
was that Khrushchev was an exper-
ienced statesman, and by “getting
his fingers burned” a few times, he
had learned the ropes. Almost any-
one that the Russians put in the
top positions, including the two in
power now, will be an amateur in
comparison to Khrushchev. Dr. Col-
vin admitted that Mr. K. was no
“good guy” but said that he did
wish to prevent a nuclear war.

The political science teacher added
his feeling that the Brezhnev-Kosy-
gin government was merely an inter-
regnum affair. He stated that neither
man had the dynamic personality

Generals Lose To Susquehanna, 28- 0
Booters Down VP I, 4- 1 For Fifth Victory

General Offense Stopped;
Crusaders Dominate Play

Susquehanna illustrated Saturday why it is ranked fifth
in the nation in small colleges by smashing Washington and
Lee, 28-0, before a large Openings crowd.

In a hard-hitting game, the visitors held the Generals to
a mere two yards on the ground, while amassing 341 yards
themselves. The passing of W&L quarterback Larry Craig

did give the Generals some offen-*

sive punch as Craig connected 10
for 18 for 116 yards.

Although outweighed almost 20
pounds per man on the line, Wash-
ington and Lee seemed to have the
undefeated Crusaders somewhat
slowed down in the initial quarter,
finally allowing speedy scatback Lar-
ry Erdman to burst through from the
seven for a TD. Erdman also added
the two-point conversion putting
Susquchanna ahead, 8-0.

Susquehanna Scores Two

In the second quarter, the Cru-
sader forward wall continued to
open up the middle and gave the
visitors’ halfbacks Erdman and John
Vignone and fullback Bill Galbraith
running room. Early in the second
stanza, Frank Metzger snuck over
for a score from the General one-

football foe, continued on its win-
ning ways this week by defeating

yard line and the try for the two
points was stopped short. Susque-
hanna scored again before halftime
with a three yard off tackle burst by
Bob Hirsch, who also added the two
points to put the Pennsylvanians
ahead at intermission, 22-0.

The third quarter gave the home
crowd some hope as the Generals
drove deep into Crusader territory
with Craig passes finding their mark
regularly. Halfback and co-captain

Bill David contributed to this drive|

with a reception run that covered 28
yards. However, an alert Susque-
hanna safetyman intercepted a hur-
ried Craig aerial on the goal-line to
stop the General drive.

Next week Washington and Lee
will seek to break a two game los-
ing streak against Hampden-Sydney.
The visiting Tigers will bring Whitey
Lipscomb, their vaunted quarter-
back, with them in hopes of repeat-
ing last year’s upset of W&L.

Only Jeff Novinger, the General
center and linebacker, was injured
in this week’s contest, and even he
may be ready for Hampden-Sydney.
W&L will also have the services of
John Anthony, its leading ground

The Generals Never Quit

Last week I inferred that W&L’s
gridders were not convinced that
they could handle Susquehanna.
My reasons for writing that ar-
ticle—and it was for a purpose—
are not important now however
after Saturday’s game no one (and

especially me) can say that
Washington and Lee's football
quit.

From where I sat, | would say
we actually hit harder than the
visitors. Obviously they had a
good, big, fast team, but the Gen-
erals never stopped hitting. There
is no reason for any player, stu-
dent, or fan of W&L to hang his
head in shame; anyone who saw
the game and heard the knocking
must admit that Susquehanna left
town with a few bruises of its own.

If we hit Hampden-Sydney like
we hit Susquehanna, Whitey Lips-
comb best drop way, way back.
Let's get back for last year’s fluke.

Cross-Country Team Beats

Old Dominion, 21-40

The cross-country team won its
sixth victory 21 to 40 Friday against
Old Dominion College on Wilson
Field.

Although losing, Green of Old Do-
minion set a new course record cover-
ingg the distance in 24 min. and 6 sec.
Andy Kilpatrick finished second in
24:41 and Lee Johnson finished third in
24:50. W&L took seven of the first
ten places in the victory.

The Generals are now 6-1. Friday
they meet Catholic University in
Washington.

Record Now 5-0;
As Henry Stars

By Bob Carter
Tuesday Sports Writer

Washington and Lee’s soccer team
recorded its fifth straight victory with-
out defeat Friday with a 4-1 win over
VPI. Playing under a driving rain
storm, the Generals slipped and slid
their way to victory on the muddy
field.

Center forward Tim Henry led the
scoring column with two goals, both
coming on penalty kicks. John Van
Bork and Brad Shinkle tallied the
other two goals.

Wet field conditions and 20 mph
winds considerably hampered play in
the first half. Timing and movements
on pasing were thrown off by the bad
weather.

Backs Howard Busse, Pete Preston,
Dave Redman, and goalie Bob Laurus
played an alert and outstanding de-
fensive game. Tim Henry, John Van

| Bork, Brad Shrinkle led the line in a

productive offensive.

Coach Lyles was pleased with the
play of his substitutes for the first
time. They hustled and kept alert, he
said.

With four games remaining the
team could possibly go undefeated.
Friday the booters meet King College
at Bristol, Tennessee American Uni-
versity, Roanoke College, and Univ.
shof Virginia, all soccer stalwarts, re-
main on the schedule.

Injured Wes Horner is a question
mark for Friday’s game. Coach Lyles
hopes he will be ready to go.

‘The Organizer’ Lacks Balance

(Continued from page 2)
consessions Italian _ proletariat
in later years from their employers
were at least in part derivative of
prior strikes and protests—as ex-
emplified in “The Organizer.”

The promary defect of “The Or-

ganizer” lies in its pace. The first
three-quarters of the film are too
slow the final half-hour moves more

swiftly and is indeed a logical accel-
eration o fthe story: as climax ap-
proaches, so do the speed of the ac-
tion and the sharpness of the cutting
increase — appropriate techniques
here, even if they are well-worn.
But the film remains out of bal-
ance. Monicelli takes too long to
establish his characters, is far too
deliberate in forming the structure
of his plot. He is careful to give
substantial development to any num-
ber of people—Pautasso, the profes-
sor, the young Omero, the inarticu-
late strongman Raul, Pautasso’s
doughter, a Sicilian “immigrant,” the
kind-hearted trollop. It is somewhat
to Monicelli’s credit that his charac-
ters emerge full-bodied but one be-
comes distinctly bored in the process.
Of course, perhaps that was the di-
rector’s intention—to induce in the
audience the desolation that the lab-
orers must have felt but if so, I
think his motives were ill-founded

(which leads to a larger considera-
tion—the value one assigns to en-
tertainment in a movie, a subject

already adequately and inadequately
discussed by others and to which I
won't bother to offer disposition.

Just for my part, I’ll repeat that be-
tween the titles and the last twenty-

five or thirty minutes of “The Or-
ganizer,” I really wasn’t too inter-
ested in what was happening).

On the other hand, I should men-
tion what seemed to me the prin-
cipal strengths of “The Organizer”:
its credibility, its general lack of
sentimentality, and the emotion
which it does manage to evoke in
the closing scenes.

Of the first, one need say little,
only that the story and its person-
alities are completely believable.
Even Mastroianni is accepted as
the indigent professor—a circum-
stance which must be attributed
more to his versatility as an actor
than to the imagination of his
make-up artist, who stretches a
point in giving his subject scumbo
rags, steel-rommed glasses, and an
unkept beard.

The second deserves greater com-
ment. Monicelli presents individuals,
not mouthpiece of ideology. It is
clear enough that “The Organizer” is
anti-management in tone but the
working class is pictured as being
as nearly as depraved as its oppres-
sor. The professor picks up a sand-
wich that a laborer ha sleft in a
meeting room. Mastroianni sets to
eat it but the owner returns and
claims it. It is evident that Mas-
troianni is virtually starving but he
is given a scowl, not charity. Yet
why shouldn’t he be scorned? The
laborer is starving, too. Each is
equally at fault in his self-interest.
Thus here, as throughout “The Or-
ganizer,” Monicelli is encouraging
reform not just of the prevailing
social structure but also of the self-
ishness of its individual components.
And since the former has already
been largely accomplished, one must
imagine that Monicelli is more con-
cerned with the latter.

Last, the final portions of “The
Organizer” are etremely well done.
Monicelli, fairly unobstrusive until
now, steps up the subjective use of
his camera and its added play serves
to intensify the involvement one
feels in the conclusion. The effec-
tiveness of that half-hour makes it
all the more regrettable that Moni-
celli is so reserved in style up to
that point. Perhaps, as previously
suggested, his rigour was calculated;
but whatever his intentions, the
overall impact of “The Organizer”
is sacrificed to the superiority of a
fraction.

CHARLES D. KIMBELL,

Editor, Friday Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir:

I should like to reply publicly to
the letter of Jim Stalnaker’s in the
October 9 edition of your paper.
Dear Mr. Stalnaker:

If I were to follow the mood that
is prompted by rallies and counter-
raids, I would do my utmost to ridi-
cule you and “cut you down” to
make you and the whole system
look as silly as possible. I do not
plan to use that tactic.

The purpose of rallies is to unite
the pledge class and make the
pledges share an experience, you
say. Mr. Stalnaker, does shoving a
freshman’s face into barf cocktail

 

make him love his fellow pledges? Is
kidnapping the pledge trainer
REALLY an inspiring experience?

You said that rallies remind the
pledge of his duty to stay in line and
respect his older brothers. I say
the pledge respects the older broth-
er LESS when he sees him (the older
brother) involved in such antics. I
say it ENCOURAGES the pledge to
disrespect his older brothers (of
course, he will be “good” more of-
ten, but look how that pledge
WAITS for an opportunity to throw
a sneering remark at an older broth-
er).

Really, Mr. Stalnaker, we ARE in
college, and many of us are physical-
ly over 21 years of age. Are there
not higher values in fraternities than
rallies? Why blanket them with this
infantile smear of mud, eggs, and
barf cocktail?

Strange. I did not MEAIN to make
the system appear foolish—I only
wanted to point out certain facts
about it.

Sincerely,
BILL JAMES

the line, it was because they were
unable to find anybody open.

The running game is also lacking
in big fast backs like Henry Sackett.
Either the backs are fast or small
or big but slow. The best back is
probably John Anthony, but An-
thony was injured and did not play
against the Crusaders.

The defense has been more than
adequate. Against Susquehanna the
defense had to play the majority of
the game because the offense was
unable to control the ball for any
appreciable amount of time. The
shoulder injury early in the game to
star linebacker Jeff Novinger also
added pressure to the defense.

The biggest weakness, though, is

a lack of experienced reserves. The
first unit has had to play more than
the coaching staff prefers. By the
fourth quarter the starters begin to
show the wear and tear of their
lack of rest.

ored to do so again this season.
