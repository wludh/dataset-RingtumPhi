Parents’ Crowd
Last Weekend
Biggest Ever

Eleven hundred parents were in
Lexington last weekend for
tenth annual Parents’ Weekend
sponsored by the University and
the Parents’ Advisory Council.

Parents’ Weekend is designed to
give the parents of W&L students
a better understanding of what goes
into an education at Washington
and Lee. The various programs pre-
sented during the two-day period il-
lustrate different aspects of the Uni-
versity.

In the area of athletics there was
a freshman football game with Fork
Union Friday afternoon; a cross-
country meet, a varsity football game
with Bridgewater, and a Soccer
game with American University, all
Saturday afternoon.

The faculty offered a number of
programs Friday afternoon and

night. Dr. David L. Meyer spoke at’———____——

the weekly chemistry —, = |
Milton Colvin and Professor
R. Huntley discussed “The mals of |
the Supreme Court in _".

Todd Lowry and Dr. Edward L

Political Economic Change in Un-
derdeveloped Countries.” “In the| |
Shadow of the Soviet Union; Rus-
sia’s Neighboring Nations” was the
- of discussion by Professor O.

Lowden

 

Students also offered several pro-|
fresh-|

Robert Penn Warren Visits W&L
For Poetry Readings and Lecture
On Pulitzer Prize Winning Novel

One of the amazing things to note
about Robert Penn Warren is his
literary versatility. Not only does
he write prose fiction and edit, he is
also a poet of no small repute. He
received his second Pulitzer Prize
in 1958 for his collection, Promises:
Pomes 1954 to 1956. This publication
of Warren’s also receieved the Na-
ational Book Award and the Edna
St. Vincent Millay Award of the
Poetry Society of America. He is
especially fond of writing long nar-
rative poems, of which “You, Emper-
or, and Others” is one of the more
famous.

Besides a number of well-known
novels such a World Enough and
Time, Night Rider, and The Cave,
Warren has published two very in-
fluential studies on social problems.
Segregation: The Inner Conflict in
the South was published in 1956 and
The Legacy of the Civil War in 1960.
Warren now teaches at Yale Univer-
sity.

Thursday night, November 5, at
8:15 p.m. in duPont Auditorium, Dr.
Warren will read from his poems.
Friday afternoon he will lecture in
duPont on the origins and meta-
morphosis of All the King’s Men.
This lecture will be held at 2:30 p.m.

Friday evening at 8:15 in duPont
there will be a reading of portions
of Warren's poem, Brother to Dra-
gons: A Tale in Verse and Voices.
Dr. Jones, Mr. Evans, Mrs. G. W.
Ray, Dr. Duvall and Mr. Boatwright
will be the readers. The reading
will be followed by a discussion led
by Warren.

The Glasgow Endowment pro-
gram was created under a legacy to
Washington and Lee from the late
Arthur Graham Glasgow, an engi-
neer and honorary alumnus of the

| university. Mr. Glasgow died in 1955.

His will directed that income from
to Washington and Lee
be known as the “Arthur and Mar-
garet Glasgow Endowment” and
that it be used to “promote the arts
of expression by tongue and pen.’

The Presidential Election

Another election has come, failed to break
through the impenetrable Washington and
Lee apathy, and gone. This student body, al-
though the majority are committed to the
candidate who should lose by a landslide, re-
mained undisturbed by the campaign. Student
inertia was in marked contrast to the efforts
of the faculty, which was probably the most
active element in this county during the en-
tire campaign. If the relative activity of Gold-
water’s and Johnson’s supporters in this area
is any key, the Republican hope that the
Democratic majority would stay home today is
unfounded.

America has had its choice and has, we
hope, picked Lyndon Johnson as the unde-
niably best qualified candidate for president.
The echo of the rout should be ringing in
Republicans ears for a long time. However,
Barry Goldwater, though he may be badly
defeated by the President, has definitely had
an effect on American politics. He has forced
the President to become a little more conserva-
tive than any other candidate could have done.
By calling attention to the danger of increas-
ing centralization Goldwater has performed a
valuable service to the country.

For his part President Johnson has also
proved something. Even if he should lose the
election, the enthusiasm Johnson aroused in
the northern cities ought to wipe out forever
the prejudice which party leaders have always
had against nominating a southerner for presi-
dent. Johnson, whose long career has been
largely devoted to overcoming sectionalism in
the legislature, has made greater strides toward
national unity in his popular appearances than
he ever could have by working behind the
scenes in the Senate. Not attempting to hard-
en his southern speaking voice or mannerisms,
Johnson has broken a very real barrier in the
same way President Kennedy broke another
barrier in 1960, without denying his back-
ground in any way.

The Republican Party faces a long road
back if Goldwater loses like the polls say he
will. The first step on the road will probably
be a revolt against the Goldwater conserva-
tives and a return to more traditional Re-
publican principles, which would be one of the
healthiest changes imaginable for America.
But the Grand Old Party will be fortunate
indeed if Goldwater’s seeming ill-fated can-
didacy has not ruined the careers of some of
the young moderates on whom the party’s
future rests, men such as Percy and Taft.
If Goldwater has dimmed the stars of men
such as these, it will indeed by an ironic blow
to Republicanism and to conservatism. For
this was the election in which a conservative
finally won the nomination and gave the
country a choice. But he was a conservative
unrepresentative of the best conservatives. He
was a conservative who failed to meet the chal.
lenge of the times. He was a conservative
who seemed determined to prove, not that
conservative methods could solve today’s prob.
lems, but that this country could blindly re-
turn to the grand old days of the last century.
As a critic of the liberal establishment Gold.
water was effective. But as a spokesman for a
conservative solution, he was a failure. His
frantic attack on immorality, his bitter slashes
at the President's character, were Goldwater's
own admissions that Goldwater conservatism
has proved inadequate for the twentieth cen-
tury.

Parents’ Weekend

The tenth annual Parents’ Weekend was
not only the biggest ever at Washington and
Lee, it was also one of the best organized. The
committee which planned the weekend, under
the direction of Dr. John Wise, is certainly
to be commended for this handling of a rec-
ord number of guests on the campus. Relative-
ly slight improvements in the administration
of the program this year made a big difference
over the weekend. But more than just run-
ning smoothly, Parents? Weekend was some-
what of a pleasant surprise for two reasons:
first, the fraternities put on an exceptionally
fine show for the parents, and second, the
football team came through with a very
satisfying first home victory of the season.

The Friday night faculty-student programs
once again proved the popularity of student
demonstrations, as the exhibition staged by
the debate team drew the heaviest attendance.
Repetition of debating as the top attraction
for the second year in a row must pose the
question to next year’s Parents?’ Weekend
Committee whether the number of student
participants in these Friday night programs
should be increased.

Next year’s committee will also face the
more serious problem of whether Parents”
Weekend has become, rather strangely, too
popular. In the last few years the number of
parents and guests attending the weekend has
approached an impossible overcrowding of
Lexington and of the campus. No ready so-
lution is available to this problem; to arrange
separate weekends for the parents of different
classes would place a heavy burden on profes-
sors and administration. To simply not invite
the parents of a particular class—say the
freshmen or seniors—would be an unfair re-
striction. Possibly there could be imposed a
restriction on the number of years a parent
could attend Parents’ Weekend. This might
not solve the problem next year, but would
cut down the number of attending guests
at least by the second year.

Lee’s Spirit Survives
(Reprointed from today’s Washington Post)

Washington and Lee University honored
the memory of both great Virginians in de-
ciding to open its doors to Negro students.
General Lee is buried on the campus in Lex-
ington, and the University still maintains the
last office he used when he served as president
of what was then Washington College. Some-
thing of Lee’s spirit plainly survives in the
University.

Before the Civil War, Robert E. Lee did
not deceive himself about the nature of slave-
ry. He regarded the peculiar institution as a
“moral and political evil—a greater evil to the
white race than to the black.” In 1865, after
he put his sword aside, Lee said, “T think it
is the duty of every citizen in the present con-
dition of the country to do all in his power
to aid in the restoration of peace and har-
mony and in no way oppose the policy of the
State or general government directed to that
object.”

So in contrast to Jefferson Davis—who
remained an irreconcilable mourner of the lost
cause——Lee gave his gifts to help build a new
South. Until his death in 1870, he was presi-
dent of Washington College. Certainly he
would have applauded his school’s decision to
conform with American practice by dropping
racial bars.

‘Freedom of Association’ at W &L

By LAMAR LAMB
Tuesday Columnist
Washington and Lee has finally
announced a policy which will in-
sure true freedom
of association at
this school, for it
is only when we
have a fully inte-
grated student
body and faculty
that we really be-
gin to talk of
“freedom of asso-
ciation.” Soon
Washington and
Lee students will
be free to associ-
ate with Negroes as equals. Soon
we will have the right, and the
opportunity, to accept or reject, like
or dislike, associate with or ignore
men who happen to be Negroes. This

is real freedom of association.
From time to time, this “freedom
of association” has been used as an
argument to support racial segre-
gation. In the sense that this argu-
ment has been used, it was entirely
wrong. It is true that at Washington
and Lee, because of its status as a
private school, we have had the
legal right to exclude people for
whatever reason we deem proper.
This does not mean, however, that

 

 

we have had the moral right to do
so. It has never been morally right
to use freedom of association to ex-
clude people for indefensible rea-
sons.

Washington and Lee has now pub-
licly recognized that there is no
moral justification for maintaining
a racially segregated society, no mat-
ter what the legal questions in-
volved. Society at large has recog-
nized that no one’s right to be
wrong about Negroes is such that it
can deny Negroes the right to equal
opportunities. Now Washington and
Lee has said that it wants to do its
part to insure to Negroes every pos-
sible opportunity consistent with the
rights of others. Washington and
Lee can be proud that it has used
its freedom to extend the associa-
tions of the student body instead of
immorally and unreasonably restrict-
ing them. Now we have the free-
dom to associate with whom we want.
Now some Negroes will have the

benefit of an education at Wash-
ington and Lee.
But there is another sense in

which Washington and Lee has now
fulfilled its legitimate function as a
university through its recent action.
With the acceptance of Negroes,
W&L is immeasurably broadening

 

its educational horizons. We are
producing leaders of American so-
ciety. Until now the men we have
been sending out have had no real
knowledge of one of the most im-
portant social problems facing our
nation. Soon our students will have
the opportunity to acquaint them-
selves first hand with Negroes and
their problems.

Not until we are personally and
intimately acquainted with Negroes
can we begin to understand either
the complexities of the problem or
the possible solutions. As one mem-
ber of the faculty recently pointed
out, only when we can personally
know Negroes as equals can we
understand even our own selves in
relation to them, much less society
at large.

So, soon W&L will be graduating
men who will at least have had a
chance to gain a significant under-
standing of race relations in con-
tempory society. Washington and
Lee can be proud of the stand it
has taken, and it can be proud of
the role it has now taken of helping
our society by building leaders who
will have a true understanding of
the worth and dignity of all human
beings, as well as a better under-
standing of themselves in relation
with other human beings.

tentionally gives a few insights into|

character which make her seem at
least human.

Harlow's fascination lay in the
fect that she was the All-American
dream. She was eligible, obiain-
able and unreluctant. You might
run into her anywhere; the drug
store, a hotel lobby, or a movie
theatre. She was not commonplace
by any means, because you were
instantly startled by her platinum
hair. bright red lips and excellent
figure. She was so American be-
cause she was what you saw in
your mind's eye just before you
fell asleep at nights or head the
word “bombshell.” In her twe Hol-
lywood marriages she gained fur-
ther affection from her fans by
choosing unromantic husbands
who could have lived next door

to anyone,

Women admired her because as
beautiful as she was. she had a heart
of gold. If she had oceasion to
sleep with your husband it was not
to break Up YOU Marriage but to
boost his ego, She may have used
her bedy ribaldly, but she was pure
in mind. Schulman describes her as
“The great All-American piece in
the white malo.”

The great question that arises
about Harlow is why, in the midst of
this country’s worst economic col-
laps .did the people queue up to
ee Jean Harlow in almost the same
number as they lined up fer soup?
There seemed to be a need for an

Loss Could Stop
Playoff Invite

By BOB CARTER

Washington and Lee’s soc

feat of the season Saturday
by losing to American Univer-
sity of Washington, 0-3. The

score was tied at 0-0 at the|
end of the first quarter with the!
Generals controlling the play. Early
in the second quarter American Uni-
versity scored on a kick from mid-
field to move out ahead 1-0.

late

The Generals were hampered by
a lack of team work, poor passing,
and bunching. American Univer-
sity was beating W&L to the ball.
The lack of teamwork and hustle
was probably due to many members
of the squad being frequently ab-
sent from practice during the past
week,

Fullback Dave Redmond was in-
jured in the second quarter with
a cut lip and had to be taken out.
Stitches were sequired to seal the
cut. Redmond remains a question

gave an early indication of the
strength which has propelled them
to the top of the Virginia Military
League as they struck savagely for
all of their points in the first quarter,
and then held on for a 20-0 victory
over the Washington and Lee fresh-
men.

A mere twelve seconds had
elapsed before FUMA had tacked
up their first tally of the afternoon
as Don Burtner gobbled up the
opening kick on his fifteen and cake-
walked into the Brigadier end zone.
The scamper was followed by Van-
Dean’s point from placement which
gave Fork Union a 7-0 advantage.

After Luke Crosland returned the}
kickoff to the W&L 35, the Baby|
Generals set up FUMA with a fum-
ble on the W&L 40. The defensive
unit, however, showed its mettle as
Strait Fairey and F. L. Wilson led

to punt into the W&L endzone. The
Brigadiers could not get untracked
on the offensive, and Rudd Smith
was forced to punt. Paul Fischette
promptly gathered in the high boot
and rambled to the thirteen and af-
ter two thrusts, Fischette bombed in
for the score from a yard out. Funk’s
attempt to pass for the conversion
was broken up.

Once again the Baby Generals
could not start a drive of their own,
and Fork Union began another

By TOM CARPENTER

Tuesday Sports Writer
The Washington and Lee football team continued its 1964
tradition by scoring only in the act of winning as the Generals
smothered the Bridgewater Eagles, 28-16, at home Saturday.

e Generals scored in only one

The big guns for the Generals were their reserve fullbacks,

*Tommy Sparks and Dan Manson.
| Sparks gained 67 yards in four car-
| ries, while Manson picked up 49
|yards in ten carries. Sparks’ big
play was his 46-yard touchdown
saunter, which broke the backs of
the visitors.

Sparks and Manson were subbing
for starter and leading ground
gainer John Anthony who reinjured
his ankle the only time he carried
| the ball against the Eagles.

Match TD's at Start

After about five minutes of play
had passed, the crowd settling down
to what appeared to be the begin-
ning of a high scoring ball game.
The first time the Eagles had the
ball they scored on a 29-yard pass
from Joe Marvel to Roger Saale. The
Generals then proceeded to match
Bridgewater's touchdown the first
time they got their hands on the
ball with Bill David getting the six
| by outmauevering the Eagle defense
on a 37-yard toss from Larry Craig.
| The Generals, however, were un-
|able to match the visitor’s extra
point as Craig was stopped short
The remainder of the half was a
standoff, giving the Eagles a 7-6
advantage for the second half kickoff.

Sparks Busts Eagles

The defense remained in command
until late in the third quarter when
Sparks burst off right tackle and
headed for the sidelines and end
zone. Bob Reading eliminated the
last man in Sparks’ path with a
bone-crushing block. Reading then
made a phenomenal grab of Bryant
Kendrick’s pass for the two-point
conversion, extricating the ball from
the hands of the defender. This
pushed the Brigade ahead, 14-0,

political and social oppression that
has developed square in the “main-
stream” of American life. Unfortu-
nately perhaps, the picture he paints
is a true one, and a tragic one.

Most of us are familiar with the
atrocities that have been a part of
the post-Civil War Southern racial
pattern—from lynchings to bomb-
ings to voter registration procedures.
What is more frightening, however,
is the extent the political, social, and
economic control that those who
wish to maintain such a society ex-
ercise over the whole state-wide
community in Mississippi. With only
a few changes here and there this
could be Alabama, Louisiana or
other deep-South states.

Dr. Silver carefully traces the re-
sults of the situation from his own
eye-witness account of the riots at
Ole Miss to his personal conversation
and correspondance with people
throughout the state on both sides
of the issue. He also proceeds firmly
to the heart of the matter, and
demonstrates for all to see that the
government of the State of Mississip-
pi, down to the county courthouse,
is dominated largely by the White
Citizens Council.

The atrocities which this alliance
produces are perhaps less sensational
but, in a way, more shocking and
repulsive. In short, those that dis-
agree are ostracized—even on oc-
casions to the point of physical vio-
lence. They consider it their “duty”
to encourage beatings of local Ne-
groes to refuse to play the quiet,
subservient role; to “weed out” those
faculty members at Ole Miss and
other institutions who dare give
their students more than one narrow
viewpoint; to work to defeat even a
student candidate for the editorship
of the campus newspaper whom they
dislike. Many of these policies ac-
tually originate in the White Citi-
zens Council, and find their way
into official policy through the Gov-
ernor’s office and the State Sover-
eignty Commission. They denounce
all those who disagree by labeling
them “communists”—and then pro-
ceed to use communist methods to
eliminate them.

Another indication is found
throughout the state press. Dr. Sil-
ver’s address to the Southern Histor-
ical Association Convention in Ashe-
ville, North Carolina in 1963 was
given a whole page in the New York
Times, but the Jackson Clarion-
Ledger simply reported under a
headline of DR SILVER SPEAKS
AGAIN, that “he absued the state of
Mississippi, its people, officials and
newspapers in the same fashion he

has in previous speeches in Atlanta,
Memphis and other points.” The re-
porting elsewhere in the state was
no better. When the “free press” be-
comes voluntarily subservient to the
government, the whole principle is
made tawdry and unworkable.

The “closed society” simply means
that the freedoms of speech and the
press, the academic freedoms of dis-
cussion and difference of opinion,
and the much mentioned “rights of
association” are all geared to one
narrow viewpoint. They have been
sidetracked for the sole use of the
White Citizens Council and the state
government .In Mississippi and much
of the South it is not truth that
counts—it is dogma; it is not the
diversity of life that counts—its is
“the system.”

It touches the lives of many—the
professor whose academic tenure
was violated on order of the Citi--
zens Council (they knew nothing
and cared less about the repercus-
sions on the University accredita-
tion); the failure of the state’s news-
papers to print the truth about the
riots at Ole Miss; the failure of a
Mississippi jury to convict a “profes-
sional agitator” who was handing
out high-powered rifles to rioting
students and pouring gasoline over
barricades and overturned vehicles;
the professor who had to keep a
borrowed shotgun in his front closet
for fear of retribution (Dr. Silver
himself!); the scores of forward-
looking businessmen and leading
citizens who bow to the “system”
rather than speak out against it
because they are afraid of the con-
sequences; and the deliberate lies
of the state government to its citi-
zens.

I am a Southerner and I have
been part of the “closed society.”
I have at least reached the point of
recognizing that such a society, de-
void of so much of the traditional
freedoms and values of American
life, must be changed or it will drag
the South into its own complete
stagnation. Every Southerner should
read this book! It shows the “closed
society” for what it is—not actually

a part of the traditional Southern)

way of life at all, but a perversion

in the last stanza. Tersh Baker, with
a helping hand from Jack Kelley,

back to pass and readied to unleash
a bomb when Kelly lowered the
boom on him. The ball dropped right

his tall end Bill Follweiler who
loped to the W&L 4. From there
Funk once again hit Follweiler for
the score and once again VanDean
converted to end the afternoon’s
scoring.

The Baby Generals’ only threat
came in the closing minutes of the
half as Tom Pittman hit Jack An-
thony and Crosland with sharp
passs and carried once himself as
W&L moved to the 18. With first
down there the Brigadier line
broke down and the half ended with
a desperation pass on fourth and 36
to go.

In the scoreless second half the
highlight was the splendid defen-
sive work of the Baby Generals as
the cadets were once stopped on
the W&L 15, and were most of the
time throttled by the outstanding
work of Buddy Atkins Strait Fairey,
F. L. Wilson, and Rawleigh Taylor.

points on dive through the line.

Chase Adds Final
The last touchdown came after an
Eagle fumble with Skip Chase
over from the one. The conversion

attempt was unsuccessful.
Bridgewater added six points near
the end of the game, as freshman
quarterback Jim Tilgnor turned a
busted play into a 14-yard touch-
down scamper. The run for the extra
points was stopped short of the goal.
Next Saturday the Generals are
hosts to the Purple Tigers of Se-
wanee, the pre-season favorites in
the CAC. Sewanee will probably be
looking ahead to the Washington
game, while the Generals would like
to make it a successful homecoming.

 

Briggs Review of H®rlow
(Continued from page 2)

I have only seen one of her movies,
“Hell’s Angels,’ made for Howard
Hughes in 1930, but the effectwas
ineradicable. There are some women
whose faces, by some strange combi-
nation of shape and lustre do not
affect you at the moment your first
shiver with recognition, but rather
afterwards in an additory flash when
the face is absent and only the
necromantie anguish returns. What-
ever look she had, it revealed her
quitessence. Her head was like a
candle’s flame over a most un-stick-
like body. The hair cured around
the radiant forehead, the bright red
lips and full-blown animated, All-
American, not particularly well-car-
ed-for beauty. Yet the other movie-
goers snickered at her cheap look-
ing gowns, chuckled at her shaved
eyebrows, and laughed at her corny
lines. She was a wayward waif, an
all-American inamorata, and a
vagrant valentine. It all goes to
show that if you want to know what
God thinks of beauty, look at the

people he gave it to.
