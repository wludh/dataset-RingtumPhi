W. Auden Play Presented

At Robert E.

By CHARLES LIVINGSTON
Associate Editor

For the Time Being, a Christmas
oratorio by W. H. Auden, was present-
ed last Sunday night in the Robert
E, Lee Memorial Episleopal Church.
Individuals of the church, V.M.L, and
the University read the long poem to
a small audience of some professors
a small audience of some professors,
some townspeople, and a few students.

The Participants

Professor James Boatwright orga-
nized and narrated the reading. Pro-
fessors Boatwright, Emmons, and Du-
vall and students Gerald Coffman,
Lockheart Handley, Starke Syndnor,
Jo Tartt, Steve Millard, Malcolm Mor-
ris, and Michael Marcoux participated
from Washington and Lee. Mrs. Eliz-
abeth Ray, wife of English professor
G,. W., Ray, read the role of Mary, Tom
Brown, Brewster Ford, and Nanalou
Sauder shared in the presentation. Few
participant read well, particularly
singly. The choruses were commenda-
ble especially considering the great
difficulties of choral reading.

Theme of Christmas

For the Time Being is a dramatic
poem on the Christmas theme pre-
sented without action, scenery or cos-
tumes. The poem has eight major
parts: Advent, the annunciation to
Mary; the Temptation of St. Joseph;
the Summons to the Wise Men; the
Vision of the Shepherds; the Visit to
the Manger; the Meditation of Simeon;

(Luke ii, 25-35); Herod’s Massacre
of the Innocents; and the Flight into
Egypt.

FRANK GREER
Tuesday Reporter

The Washington and Lee Univer-
sity Glee Club combined with the
Randolph-Macon girls’ choir to per-
form Handel’s “Messiah” Sunday af-
ternoon.

Under the direction of Randolph-
Macon’s Roger Cole, the hour-long
performance began at 5:00 p.m. before
a capacity audience in Randolph- Ma-
con's Smith Memorial Auditorium.
Asked to comment on the perform-
ance, W&L's Professor Robert Stewart
replied, “It was perhaps the cleanest
performance of the “Messiah” by the
two groups in recent years. The open-
ing chorus was particularly commend-
able and the soloists were exceptional.

Student Director Praised

He also expressed satisfaction that
the W&L Glee Club so easily adapted
themselves to another director and
praised the fine solo performance by
W&L's Dan Manson and William Su-
pon. Following the performance, the
two groups enjoyed a candlelight din-
ner prepared by the Randolph-Ma-
con component.

The Washington and Lee University
Glee Club's next performance will be
at the candlelight service this Thurs-
day night at 8:00 p.m. in the Robert

to the poem that “the form of the
Christmas Oratorio immediately sug-
gest three kinds of meaning; the
unique in carnation; the attempt to
apprehend and experience the event
at the center of the Christian year;
the constant attempt of Christians to
understand, make visable and repeat

For the Time Being generally succeeds
in keeping the reader simultaneously
aware of all three of these meanings.

The annual Dixie-Classic debate
tournament was held last weekend
at Wake Forest College in Winston-
Salem, North Carolina. Considered
one of the finest tournaments in the
South and East, such schools as
Duke, Army, Navy,, Georgetown,
University of Virginia, and William

Though Washington and Lee’s rec-| :

superior, for his extemporaneous|
speaking performance. A debate |
tournament often contains not only
regular debate rounds, but also)
competition in after dinner speak-
ing, in which the chief aim is tail-
oring a speech to a specific audience.
Another category sometimes includ-
ed is oratory, mainly persuasive in
nature, and finally extemporaneous
speaking, which entails quick recall
of current events. Dr. William Rey-|
nolds of the Georgetown U. debate |
program said, “Wainscott is the best |
freshman debater I have heard this
year.”

Overall, both teams for Washing-
ton and Lee at the tournament won
three and lost five rounds, the af-
firmative team consisteing of Fred
McMurray and Rick Kneipper and
the negative team of Jeff Wainscott
and Hal Higginbotham. After a
Christmas suspension of debate ac-
tivities, the next major tournament
will be at Johns Hopkins University

64 Language Sing To Be Held
Tomorrow Night In Lee Chapel

The annual Washington and Lee
Foreign Language Sing will be held
tomorrow evening in Lee Chapel. As
has been the tradition for the past
sixteen years, each language depart-
ment will send a group of boys to
sing a selection of songs, both tradi-
tional and Christmas, in that particu-
lar language. In addition, this year a
group of French students from Lex-
ington High School will participate
in the sing.

The French department, under the
direction of Dr. George Francis Drake,
will, in addition to their annual ver-
sion of “Ilouette” sing a number of
high spirited drinking songs. Among
these are “Boire un Petit Coup” “Au-
pres de ma Blonde” and “Cadet Rous-
selle.” The French vocalist will con-
clude their program with a patriotic
rendition of “La Marseillaise.”

The German students, lead by Prof.
David Dickens, will sing a number of

CONTACT Plans Discussed

By DAVE MARCHESE
Last night's meeting of the IFC
was probably the longest and most
interesting since the year began
There were not any of the humor-
ous implications as on occasions in

nature of the various preposals
The prebation officer was
first at the meeting
ind the fraternities
hold spot-cheeks at their parties te

past because
eounty
to hold forth
proposed that

earch out uninvited “townies.” It
eomes that there were 25 occasions
last year when Townies had gone

en a destructive drinking epree in
Lexington and vicinity after attend-

ing WAL fraternity parties

This would be a safeguard for
the fraternities as a local judge
has threatened to apply the rule
af law known as: “contributing to
the delinquency of a minor,” by
serving them liquer or allowing
them to drink on the premises,
The attempt, according to the pro-
bation officer, is to avoid the
nature of the Townles after con-
suming a little liquor. I reminds

 

this reporter of the days when the
American Indian used to go ber-
serk after imbibing firewater.

The next significant note of busi-
hess was the proposal by Chuck
Griffin, Bus Committee Chairman.
to accept the new agreement made
with Pete's Taxi Co. After exten-
sive study by the committee it was
agreed that Pete's Taxi would es.

Tuesday Edition

Aftermath Of The Referendum

Last Wednesday’s referendum on conventional dress and
the Assimilation Committee is a thing of the past. Or is it?
The votes have been tallied to be sure, but the implications
of the vote are still in the breeze.

The Tuesday Edition was pleased, and a bit surprised, by
the outcome of the vote. We were pleased that the Assimilation
Committee, as an idea, was upheld. We were surprised that
such a large percentage of the vote (about 36 per cent to be
exact) was in favor of the “status quo” as far as the committee
or conventional dress were concerned. The important question
remains—what changes in Assimilation policy should be made?

Campus leaders have said both before and after the refer-
endum, “Some changes in policy will obviously have to be
made.” There are dangers, however, that lurk in so general an
idea of concession. We agree that the Executive Committee
and the Assimilation Committee ought to lend a receptive ear
to the desires of the student body; yet we do not feel that the
long standing high ideals of gentlemanly dress here ought to
be sacrificed simply because they have come under some criti-
cism. The report of the written suggestions on the referen-
dum are still forthcoming; however, a good guess can be made
as to the policies that will come under the most frequent attack.

First of all will be the question of “wheat jeans.” Only
a few would try to defend wheat jeans as gentlemanly dress.
They are not. The problem enters with the objection that no
one could be able to tell a student here that these particular
brand of pants are not “conventional.” The Assimilation Com-
mittee has tried all fall to explain their objection (backed by
the EC) to wheat jeans: the cut of the pants, the general
sloppy appearance of those who wear them, and the fact that
if wheat jeans are allowed, why should not blue jeans be al-
lowed also? Someone had to make a decision on this question,
and we feel that the Assimilation Committee has made a cor-
rect one. It is hard to imagine what dress at Washington and
Lee would be like if students were left entirely free to judge
for themselves what was conventional dress. Probably the
majority of students do want high standards of dress, but with-
out some sort of organ to oversee these standards, the appear-
tance of the campus would be marred by a few. We of the Tues-
day Edition, therefore, hope that wheat jeans will not be
condoned as “conventional dress.”

The basic coat and tie tradition will be safe. It is possible,
however, that some will ask that ski parkas be allowable
substitute for sports coats. Acknowledging here how warm a
parka is during the winter, the best solution is to make clear
that ski parkas are fine, as long as one goes to the small trouble
of putting a sports coat on underneath the parka. Just think
of how much warmer you'll be then!

And what about the dollar fines? Brooks Brown, present
Chairman of the Assimilation Committee, has squelched all
rumors stating that these small fines in any way enrich the com-
mittee, as a whole or as members. The object of the fines is
simply to give the committee some means of controlling the
more flagrant violators. In an attempt to reflect more the
spirit of conventional dress, the committee has not fined all
those who have appeared before it this fall—only those who
have no respect for conventional dress or are constant violators.
This policy breeds not only understanding, but it does enable
the Assimilation Committe to do an effective job on campus.

One point about assimilation policy that may come out of
the referendum, and justly so, is that of where and when con-
ventional dress should be worn. To expect it on campus at all
times is as it should be; and yet, what about town after dark,
and or Saturday afternoons. There is possibly room here to
relieve the anxiety of many students who may not have time to
change while taking a break at night or while on a weekend

date.
A Word On Contact

Our student body is going on trial in the next few months.
This trial will not, in affect, render a verdict of guilty or
innocent; however, it may render a verdict even more lasting
to this student body and to student bodies of the future.

The case in question will be the Interfraternity Council’s
proposed CONTACT Weekend. CONTACT will be an intel-
lectual symposium for this student body. It was proposed by
students. It will be run by students.

Many have said that Washington and Lee students are
completely socially oriented and have no interest outside the
classroom in anything which resembles an intellectual ex-
posure. It was for this reason that members of our faculty and
administration overwhelming approved the IFC’s idea for such
an intellectual program. When this proposal was passed, many
members of both the faculty and administration exp
a great deal of skepticism concerning our student body’s abil.
ity to actually sucessfully present and support a program of
this nature. Many still hold this skepticism.

Therefore, it will be our job to show these skeptics that
Washington and Lee students can present and support a pro-
gram such as CONTACT. Until these skeptics are convinced
that today’s W&L student is interested in more than a “five
o'clock cocktail” or a “weekend honey,” they will remain un-
willing to allow us to indulge in such luxuries as the five day
week, free study programs, and a lightened load of “busy
work.”

The burden of proof lays on our shoulders.

‘Any Number’ Passes As Mystery,
Despite Music and Trick Ending

By MAC RIVES |

There are pitfalls which one
writing for the Ringt-tum Phi learns
to expect: Phrases deleted in his
copy words changed and mis-
spelled, commas struck, semi-colons
postponed, capitals donated, pic-
tures—all of which serve to make
the contributor look even more a
novice than he might already be.
Fortunately, of course, no one but
the writer maligned cares; and the
haphazard treatment he occasionally
receives is really no more than what
he deserves for presuming to give
his opinion in the first place.

Which brings me, somewhat fal-
laciously, to Any Number Can Win,

 

a movie with virtually no preten-
sions. It is a mystery, the story of
a billion franc coup in a Cannes
casino. The characters are stock—
Jean Gabin as the two-time loser
fresh out of the can Alain Delon
as the young vopain with the span-
gled leather jacket and criminal
apprenticeship. Jeans wife wants him
to buy a restaurant on the Riviera,
but Jean says no go. He has bigger
things invisioned.
Is It Tony?

The crime, appropriately intricate,
is eventually realized only to be
frustrated by the predictable trick
ending. But during the interim be-
tween conception and execution one

 

The Oldest Of Christmas Stories
Made New: Food For Thought

By WEB DeHOFF

And it came to pass in those days, that there went out an
advertisement from Greedius Merchantus, that all the world

should buy.

And all went to buy, every one into his chosen store.
And Joe also went up from subdivision, out of the sprawl

of suburbia, into Town, unto the store of departments, which
is called Macy’s; (because he was of*

the credit system and mailing list |
of Macy’s).

To buy with Marge his espoused
wife, being loaded with errands.

Things Were Bought

And so it was, that, while they
were there, the things were bought
which had to be given.

And they brought forth their
quick-bought presents, and wrap-
ped them in brown paper, and laid
them in a mailbox; because there
was no room for them in the Post
Office.

And there were in the some town
policemen abiding in the street,
keeping watch over the traffic by
night.

And, lo, a cynic of today came
upon them, and the fumes of Bour-
bon smelt round about him: and they
were sore angered.

“For Behold”

And the cynic said unto them,
Watch out: for behold, I see Christ-
mas crowds with great shopping lists,
which include all people.

actually not as bad at the junior
partner in the robbery. The compar-
sion which some have drawn be-
tween him and Tony Perkins isn’t
particulary apt, as Mr. Perkins dem-
onstrated in Phaedra. Not analogous
roles, to be sure, but T. P. doesn’t
merit analogies.

Gabin is equally satisfactory as
the mastermind—sauve, tought, flex-
ible. One doesn’t think him repre-
hensible, which is proper, since the
audience must be induced to sym-
pathize with him if the movie is to
succeed at all. Correction: perhaps
people don’t care that much whether
Gabin mades it or not, for he does
plain to flee the Caberra afterwards
and retire on a sheep ranch. The
charitable interpretation is that he
is kidding.

Cannes Is No Problem

Well, cheap cleverness anyway
isn’t a fault of Any Number Can
Win. There is little to distract one
from the central object of Gabin
and Delon, excepting the dancers
and international trollops at poolside
and elsewher. Cannes glitters, is a
nice setting for un houldup, and the
easy elegance of the gambling rooms

World War Makes Room
For ‘Two Women’ at WGL

By HEAD NEWMAN
Assistant Managing Editor

When Pear! Harbor was bombed in
December of 1941, many students
at Washington and Lee left to join
the armed services. As the months
went by, more and more students
left and the faculty became wor-
ried over the reduced attendance.

Several faculty members suggest-
ed that this loss of enrollment might
be hade up by admitting women to
the University. These faculty mem-
bers evidently felt that the thou-
sands of women throughout the
South who felt blighted because they
had not been allowed to attend W&L
in the past would jump at the
chance to come to Lexington and
find a suitable mate.

Faculty Split

When the faculty voted on this
issue ,the results were very inter-
esting. It seems that all non-alumni

cynic a multitude of the hurried | in the faculty, without exception,
shoppers, pushing people, and say-| yoted for the admission of women.
ing, “Glory to Givers in the highest,| On the other hand, all of the alumni

 

and in stores bargains, cheap prices
on presents.”
It Came To Pass

And it came to pass, as the shop-
pers were gone away from them in-
to the stores, the policemen said to
one another, Let us go even unto
Macy's, and see if this thing is

 

come to pass, which the cynic hath
made plain unto us.

And they came with haste, and
found Marge, and Joeshp, and the
babe lying in a manager, beauti-
fully girft-rappey for only $4.98
(plus tax).

on the faculty voted against the pro-

posal, except one. Perhays this
that four years at W&L will warp
anybody's mind.

The proposal was approved and
steps had to be taken to prepare
the campus for coeds. Rooms had to
be provided that were suitable for
women, and a Dean of Women had
to be added to the faculty.

Two Brave Souls

Applications were accepted for
the summer session of 1943, When
the final results were tabulated, it

 

was found that W&L had sold its

birthright for the admission of
two women. Actually there were a
total of twenty-five women here that
summer, but these were the only
two that came from outside of
Rockbridge County.

These two adventurous young
ladies did not waste their tuition
for the summer; by September both
were engaged to fellow students at
Washington and Lee. The first to
be married was Miss Wada Wade.
Her maid of honor was Miss Eliza-
beth Weaver, the other conspiring
coed. It is rumored that the bride-
groom suggested the playing of the
W&L Swing as the processional and
College Friendships as the recession-
al; of course, this is only hearsay.

Life on Campue

This story should make many peo-
ple reflect on just what life on cam-
pus would be like if W&L was co-
educational. It could be compared
to having nine a months SIPA con-
vention.

Those dull night during the week
could certainly be improved if you
had only to call the girls’ dorm
and tell her you would pick her up
in fifteen minutes. No longer would
you have to drive 175 miles to pick
your date up, bring her back to
Lexington, take her back to school,
and drive over the mountains again
in a sleepy daze at 2 in the morning.

Having girls on campus would
probably cause a great deal of
clumsiness on the part of the male

of the student body—an
example might be pencils and pens
dropped in classes.

 

A Reply To Saunders

 

Should John Lindsay Campaign
For The Republican Party?

Editor's note: This story was
turned in to the Ring-tum Phi as a.
letter in reply to a column in last |
Tuesday's Edition by Steve Saun-
ders. The letter appears as a column
here.
To the Editor:

Last week this newspaper printed,
an article by Mr. Steve Saunders)
extolling the virtues and bright fu-)
ture of Republican Representative
John V. Lindsay of New York.

Among other things, Mr, Saunders.
told us that Rep. Linsay “.,. achiev-|
ed national prominence...” through
his refusal to support Senator Gold-
water, the head of his party's na-|
tional ticket.

With regard to this noble gesture,
I quote Rep. Lindsay as of Jan. 24,
1964: “Whoever the Republicans
nominate is certainly deserving of
the support of all Republicans.”

Man Without a Party

It is also interesting to note that
among his profuse campaign posters,
pamphlets, ete. never once did the
word Republican appear. Gov. Rom-
ney and Senator Scott, to name but
two, vietoriously campaigned as Re-
publicans while still not embracing

Sen. Goldwater. It is only Rep. Lind-|
say who is ashamed of his party.
Finally, to paraphrase Mr. Nixon,
a man who voluntarily sits on the
sidelines during the game should
not ask to be made captain of the
team.

One of the loudest and most per-
sistent charges against Sen, Gold-
water was that he was, in Gov.
Rockfeller's phrase, “...out of the
mainstream...” of the Republican
Party. How, I asked Mr, Saunders,
do you determine whether or not a
man is in his party's “mainstream.”
The reply: “Well...his voting ree-
ord is an excellent way.” Let us

| then look at Lindsay's voting record.

Lindsay and the A.C.A. Ratings

The Americans for Constitutional
Acton, a highly conservative or-
ganization, grades all congressmen
solely on their voting record. A 100
per cent rating, then, indicates a
quite conservative position; a 10
per cent, a very liberal one, With the
same criteria applied to all con-
gresamen, these ratings obviously)
provide an objective view of their
relative conservative or liberal)
standing. The following ACA.)
figures are for the Republican mem - |

bers of the eighty seventh and
eighty eighth congresses:

The average rating was 80 per
cent. Lindsay's rating was thirty-
five per cent. One hundred seventy-
nine representatives were rated more
conservative than Lindsay; only
four more liberal.

Even the firey Silvio Conte, rep-
resentative from Massachusetts and
leader of the liberal fight in the
platform committee, rated 61 per
cent.

The Crucial Question

The important question, though, is
this: should a party nominate a man

who does not agree with the ma-
jority's thought? Mr. Saunders
reply: “No.”"—the same _ implicit

in Gov. Rockefelier's repetitive com-
ments on the subject.

It is most comforting to know,
then, that Mr. Saunders and Gov.
Rockfeller, according to their es-
poused beliefs, would never support
Lindsay for the party's leadership
since he is, as these facts prove,
definitely in the ultra left wing of
his party, and most certainly out
of its “mainstream.”

School Alumnus
Defends Frats
After Hollins Letter

Editor, Tuesday Edition
Ring-tum Phi
Lexington, Virginia.

Miss Sylvia Doughty, Editor, Hol-
lins Columns, did quite a job on the
ego of the W&L male in your Nov.
20 paper. Since she blamed the prob-
lem on the fraternity system at
W&L, I felt it was necessary to set
her straight. Fraternities have
enough problems without Sylvia
Doughty’s theory that in some man-
ner W&L students have degenerated
from knights to knaves because of
some mysterious influence of the
fraternity system at W&L.

No doubt her “lamant” was writ-
ten in the spirit of good, clean,
Hollins-type fun, but there are
enough characters running around
loose who latch on to any criticism
of fraternities, that I took advantage
of the opportunity to suggest that
fraternities be restored to their pre-
vious position of strength.

The administration and faculty are
encouraging weakening of the fra-
ternity system, and the fraternity
members themselves are playing
along unconsciously by constantly
changing (or considering changes)
the rushing system, by reducing the
utilization of the fraternity houses
through members living out, and by
failing to properly indoctrinate the
freshmen .

The new rushing system adopted
this year will in a few years serious-
ly affect 25 per cent of the chapters
at W&L. It is a poor system because
it places the initiative in the hands
of the freshmen. It will weaken fur-
ther those houses that are already
weak which is not good for the
overall fraternity organization. Cur-
rent national conditions require all
fraternities to join together to beat
off the attackers.

Saturday Classes
Re-evaluated
By Two Students

To the Editor:

Last week’s editorial in support of
Saturday classes was marked by a
complecent, inflexible outlook. The
idea of eliminating Saturday classes
was dismissed as being next to im-
possible on technical grounds, and
less than desirable for other rea-
sons, including its supposed lack of
utility for furthering academic goals.

The question is, how valid are
these arguments? First, the con-
tention that it is practically impos-
sible to reschedule classes so that
those on Saturday can be eliminated
is highly questional! Anyway, this is
a technical matter and should be
resolved by studying other schools
which have been able to “do the
impossible.”

Despite the uninformed assump-
tion that only girls’ schools which
do not have ROTC programs are
able to do without Saturday classes,
the editor might find information to
the contrary if he would look beyond
the confines of the Shenandoah Val-
ley. Secondly, the assumption that
“the change would be in allowing
uninterrupted road trips” is particu-
larly sad. Though some students
may lack the sufficient academic or
intellectual discipline to devote their
increased free time to worthwhile
pursuits, this is no valid reason,
especially at an educational institu-
tion where it is assumed that indi-
viduals are mature, to penalize those
students who might wish to spend a
little extra time studying or just
reading for pleasure.

For a University to follow poli-
cies aimed at students too irrespon-
sible to have more than a day pet
week of “free time” is to deny to
responsible students the opportunity
to further their formal education
with personal research and inquiry.
If you argue that we are being un-
realistic, we can only say that if
this is your answer, you are denying
the supposed excellence of the
Washington and Lee student body
and the high reputation of our Uni-
versity. In summary we believe that
Mr. Smith and the Tuesday Edition
of the Ring-tum Phi should drop
their esesntially negative defense of
the status quo and replace their
viewpoint with a more responsible
and creative analysis of reality

Chemistry Seminar To Feature
Phillip Mollere on Dimension

On Friday, December 18, at 5:00
p.m., the Chemistry department will
present another of its seminars. This
week’s is entitled “Projections of the
Fourth Dimension.” Philip Mollere will
give the talk.

Said Mollere, “The talk may be de-
scribed as a layman’s introduction to
the concept of four dimensional geom-
etry. It is not a rigorous mathemati-
cal analysis.”

The seminar will be preceded by tea
and cookies at 4:30 p.m.

Each week the Chemistry depart-
ment presents a seminar, though the
subjects are not necessarily confined
to chemistry. Past topics have includ-

which netted $170. The FCA is pres-

Financial Problems

The major problem which faces
Contact is finances and this is un-
derstandable since it is in its first
year of operation. As a_ result,
Brown proposed that since the IFC
conceived Contact as a function of
the IFC, it is the fraternities’ re-

will students discover what type
of costume they are to receive.

Since the theme for the dance is
“Showboat,” the outfits will range
from facsimiles of gamblers’ outfits
to Civil War officers’ uniforms in or-
der to accommodate everyone. Dates
for the dance will not rent costumes
and are requested to wear long form-
als.

sponsibility to support it. And so,
the IFC has been asked to under-
write any deficit Contact may in-
cur. This of course presupposes that
every existing fund-raising effort
fails completely which is highly
improbable.

In order that the burden does
not fall on the IFC and conse-
quently asked that they encourage
any possible parental contribu-
tions, The larger the contributions
from the parents the less money
the students will have to pay. As
Contact has reduced its budget
drastically, Brownell is confident
that even the smallest parental
support will prove sufficient.

Brownell is quoted as saying that
“this was an opportunity for the stu-
dents to make a very great educa-
tional contribution to the University,
a continuing contribution if this
year’s symposium is successful.
