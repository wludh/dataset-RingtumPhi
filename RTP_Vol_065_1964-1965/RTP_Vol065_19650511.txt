Charles Percy
Says Viet War
Might Be Long

Illinois Republican
Predicts U.S. Victory
In Lee Chapel Address

If the war in Viet Nam “is a short
war, we'll lose it; if it’s a long one,
we'll win it,’ a leading Republican
said here Friday.

Charles H. Percy, of Illinois, ad-
dressing several hundred at Washing-
ton and Lee University’s Lee Chapel,
said a recent tour of Viet Nam has
convinced him, “We must have pa-
tience.

Percy said it will take time to de-
feat the Viet Cong communists be-
cause it is jungle, guerrilla type war-
fare. He added that he is “strongly in
favor of the president’s policy” in
Viet Nam and “there is little ques-
tion in my mind that if we pull out,”
we will eventually lose all of south-
east Asia.

Percy said he hopes soldiers from
other countries can be brought in to
help the U.S. fight the communists.
He listed the Australians, Thais and
Filippinos among others.

The Illinois Republican spoke here
at the invitation of Washington and
Lee senior Jim De Young, a neigh-
bor and good friend of Percy's in Ken-
ilworth, Ill, and a worker last fall in
Percy's unsuccessful bid for the Illi-
nois governorship.

Percy left no doubt in his audience's
mind he will seek the governor’s seat
the next time around, too.

“We hope to run the rascals out,”
he said in answer to a question on
how his next campaign will differ from
last year’s.

Percy, the 45-year-old board chair-
man at Bell & Howell Co., is in this
area to attend the President's Business
Advisory Council meeting at nearby
Hot Springs.

graduating Class of 1965 at 6:30 p.m.
on Wednesday evening, May 12, at
Evans Dining Hall. All academic
and law seniors, as well as those who
will graduate in February 1966, have
been invited to attend by the Alumni
Association.

February Seniors

Mr. William C. Washburn, execu-
time secretary of the Alumni Asso-
ciation, emphasized that all academic
and law seniors who will receive
their diplomas next February are
nontheless welcome to attend the
senior banquet. It was requested
that those February seniors inter-
ested in attending notify the alumni
office in Washington Hall.

The Sazeracs will provide the en-

|tertainment for the banquet. Also
| on the program will be remarks by
| Washburn, and presentation of the
Frank J, Gilliam Award to an out-
standing senior.

Gilliam Award

Described as the “high point” of
the evening, the presentation of the
Gilliam Award will be handled by
the Student Body Executive Com-
mittee. Selection was made by an
E.C. subcommittee chaired by law
representative Jere Turner. Art
Broaddus, 1963-64 president of the
IFC, received the Gilliam Award
last year.

Mr. Washburn stated that the ban-
quet is given by the Alumni Asso-
ciation to weleome the seniors as
alumni, and to impress upon them
their privileges and responsibilities
as alumni of Washington and Lee.

 

 

Kansas Republican Congressman

To Speak Here On Wednesday

U. S. Representative Robert F.
Ellsworth (R-Kansas), the only con-
gressman presently serving on three
standing committees of the House of
Representatives, will speak in Lee
Chapel on Wednesday evening, May
12, at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel.

Appearing under the auspices of
W&L’s Young Republican Club,
Congressman Ellsworth will speak on
“The Future of the Republican
Party: Its Problems and Opportuni-
ties.”

The Young Republican's new
“Eminent Speaker” program will be-
gin with Ellsworth’s address. Promi-
nent Republicans will be brought to
Lexington from time to time under
this new program to address the
student body on subjects of interest
to partisians of both major political
parties.

Fall Fraternity Rushing Program

Modified By IFC

By JUDSON SIMMONS !
Retiring IFC president Steve Hib-|
bard turned over his duties to newly |
elected president Chuck Griffin at)
last night’s weekly meeting. Griffin
then presented Hibbard a gavel on|
behalf of the IFC for his services
during the past year.

Three topics dominate the discus-
sion of the relatively short meeting
The House Managers Association,
CONTACT, and rush week were
considered in some detail.

The House Managers Association
was dissolved and its duties taken
over by the IFC. This new respon-|
sibility of the council will include
payment to Bob Murry during the
summer for checking each fraternity
house daily and paying the Orkin
Pest Control Company for its ser-
vices during the summer.

CONTACT was officially taken un-
der the auspices of the IFC. The
four point notion which was passed
follows. 1) The IFC is to sponsor
CONTACT; 2) The IFC is to appoint
a representative to the steering com-
mittee of the symposium which will
be held every year except Mock
Convention years; 3) The IFC Ju-
diciary Board is to elect the chair-
man of CONTACT with the recom-
mendation of the past chairman; 4)
The IFC will assume any debits ol
CONTACT after all other sources of
revenue have been exhausted

As a result of this year's weekend

will be of $1
man to cover some outstanding
bills. Griffin also stressed that ap-
plications are being received until
this Friday for the position of CON-
TACT chairman for 1066

procedure eliminated the practice of
signing up freshmen for rush dates

eform of Absence Regulations

Unlimited Cuts for Juniors and Seniors;
Lower Classes Granted Increased Cuts;

Automatic Overcut Penalty Changed

By FRANK FAIRCHILD ...

At its regular monthly meeting yesterday, the Faculty
adopted a new resolution which will afford juniors and seniors
the opportunity of determining their own class attendance and
will give freshmen and sophomores two weeks of cuts in all of

their basic courses.

Announcing the new cut system, Dean Pusey emphasized

Next Freshman
Class Admitted;
350 Will Enter

Three Merit Winners
In Class of 1969;
Assistance Increased

By WALTER BORDA

James Farrar, Dean of Admissions,
announced yesterday that 350 appli-
cations for the class of ‘69 have ac-
cepted offers of admission. The Com-
mittee on Admissions passed favor-
ably on 630 applications from the
1550 they received.

The Committee on Admissions con-
sists of Deans Atwood, Farrar, Gil-
liam, John, and Professors Barritt,
Coulling, Jarrard, Jenks, Jennings,
Jones, Pinney Ravenhorst, Spencer,
and Stephenson.

For the first time since 1962, Na-
tional Merit Scholarship winners will
be among the entering Freshman
class. Three students will hold these
scholarships. In 1962, there was only
one.

Class Is Strong

Overall statistics on the class have
not yet been catalogued. But Dean
Farrar said, “The entering class is a

particularly strong one and we are,
very happy to have the Merit Schol-

arship winners included in it.”

The College Board SAT scores are
expected to be higher than last year’s
602 verbal and 635 math average.
The average class standing, while
varying from school to school, is
expected to be in the first and sec-

ond quintiles. No change in the
present North-South distribution is
expected.

Scholarships and Loans

“Financial assistance in scholar-
ships and loans has risen thirty per-
cent,” said Dean John, Associate di-
rector of Admissions. This rise is
principally due to a recent anon-
ymous donation toward the Lee
Scholarship program.

Six Baker and ten Lee Scholar-
ships, paying the complete cost of
tuition, were granted. Fifty-seven
students will take part in the grant-
loan program and six others have
received Washington Awards. These
awards are token grants of $100
honoring particularly well-qualified
applicants

Four local high school students
will receive Rockbridge County
grants. These scholarships are spon-
sored by the university and cover
much of tuition costs. To qualify
one must be a resident of Rock-
bridge County and present an ac-
ceptable high school record

Commenting on the financial aid
program, Dean John said, “I am
gratified that we were able to help

as many applicants as we did. In the
past the program has contributed
greatly to maintaining the high
quality of the student body, and I
expect it to continue doing is in
the future.”

*that the new absence regulations will

become effective in September 1965.
He urged all students to continue to
adhere carefully to the present re-
strictions which will be enforced
during the remaining days of this
semester.

Courses and Degrees Committee

The revised absence regulations
came as a direct result of action ini-
tiated by the Faculty at its April
session. During its meeting last
month, the Faculty requested the
Committee on Courses and Degrees
to draft a plan for an undated sys-
tem restricting absences.

Commenting on the new faculty-
approved cut system, Dean Pusey,
Committee Chairman, stated: “Un-
der the new absence regulations
next, students who can determine
their own class attendance will have
to take more personal responsibility
for their education.”

According to the new system, there
will be a retention of both Dean's
List and Honor Roll privileges and
of the present system of absences in
physical education. Consequently,
all students, with the exception of
those on the Dean’s List anad Hon-
or Roll, are still prohibited from
taking unexcused cuts before and
after holidays.

While they will be allowed un-
limited cuts in courses numbered
above 200, freshmen and sophomores
will be permitted twice as many ab-
sences in each course below 200 as

 

there are class meetings of the
course per week. Juniors and sen-
iors will be able to determine their

(class attendance in all courses.

Make Us Work

Under the new regulations, a stu-
dent will not be allowed to make
up assigned work except in case of
illness or emergency, unless advance
arrangement is made with his pro-
fessor. Also, any professor who con-
siders that cuts have contributed
materially to unsatisfactory work on
the part of any student may request
the appropriate dean to revoke the
student's absence privileges in his
course.

Each unexcused absence will be
penalized by the deduction of one
quality credit and one grade point
from a student's semester and cum-
ulative grade-point ratio. This pen-
alty will be subject to immedite
appeal to the Absence Committee.

Sentiment among the Faculty gen-
erally reflects the hope that this new
plan will not only encourage per-
sonal responsibility on the part of
the individual student, but will also
generate a more spontaneous inter-
est in learning among the student
body.

4 New Challenge

It was just a little over a year and a half ago that the
faculty adopted what was then considered a relatively
liberal absence policy. At that time a great deal was said
about the maturity and sense of responsibility present
within the student body. Once again the faculty after
extensive and comprehensive analysis ratified an extreme-
ly liberal cut system which we feel eliminates many of the
weaknesses of the previous policy. At the same time it is
incumbent upon the student body to assume the burden
which the new system places on them.

The revised system leaves to the professor an oppor-
tunity to exercise a great deal of discretion while offering
considerable freedom to the responsible student. Ic is still
the prerogative of any faculty member to set absence reg-
ulations for individuals or entire classes if he feels that
non-attendance contributes to failure. The degree to
which professors are forced to revoke absence privileges
will, of course, depend on the willingness of students to
demonstrate a real measure of self discipline in the con-
duct of their absence habits.

Perhaps the most pleasing aspect of the new absence
policy is the elimination of the F penalty for overcutting.
This rule has been the subject of extensive debate among
faculty as well as students. Just two weeks ago the
Executive Committee submitted a recommendation to the
Committee on Courses and Degrees indicating its desire
to substitute the reduction of quality credits for the F
penalty. The new policy on overcuts employs not only
the E.C. proposal but in addition it further penalizes the
violator by reducing quantity credits. Although some may
view this modification as insignificant, we feel strongly
that it is a vast improvement over the previous policy.

Undoubtedly, students will be disappointed to note
that the new policy retains some traditionally unpopular
regulations. The P.E. department still remains protected
from the absence system under which the rest of Univer-
sity operates. Cutting before and after holidays is limited
to Dean’s List and Honor Roll students as well as certain
second semester seniors. Also, sophomores may find that
under the new system they actually have fewer excused
absences. In spite of these limitations, it is hard to antici-
pate anything but the most wholehearted and overwhelm-
ing endorsement of the student body.

One final warning should be issued in connection with
the liberalization of the absence regulations. The new
policy does not go into effect until next semester includ-
ing the revised overcut penalty. For this reason it is im-
perative that strict adherence to the present system be
maintained. Surely the promise of increased academic
freedom warrants further evidence of maturity and judg-
ment on the part of all.

The Ring-tum Phi encourages the student body to
examine carefully the opportunities and_ responsibilities
offered in this revised system. Failure of the student body
to live up to faculty expectations will certainly result in
a reversal of the present trend toward academic freedom.

_

Opportunity For Improvement

The McCormick Library is probably one of the most
talked about and yet least known institutions on this
campus. Faculty and students alike systematically degrade
and belittle the services of the library. Unfortunately, all
too little is known about the financial resources or actual
content of our library. In addition to these ignorances,
the Student Library Committee realizes very little of its
potential as a constructive force in initiating positive re-
forms.

It is implausible and indeed inaccurate to judge a
library by statistical data, however conclusive it may be.
Numerical content is only one criterion by which the ade-
quacy or inadequacy of a library should be judged. The
endowment of the University plays a large part in the
limitations which confront the library. It should be
pointed out that the budget of the library has been in-
creasing every year, and that by 1970 the University in-
tends to at least double the present allocation.

Notwithstanding the financial limitations of our libra-
ry, there are certain areas in which long-needed improve-
ment can and should take place. One of these areas is
the unnecessarily involved process of checking out a book
The difficulties inherent in the present system are most
apparent when a student must check out a large number
of volumes for a paper. Certainly some streamlined and
more efficient method can be implemented without dis-
rupting the operation of the library.

There is really no reason why the stacks could not

 

remain open at least during the supper hour. It is dis
concerting, to say the least, to be in the midst of a paper
and then be forced to leave the stacks and reference ma
terial for a period of over two hours. If the Honor Sys-
tem operates in the use of other facilities on this campus,
it would seem that students could be allowed fo remain
in the stacks without the supervision of an attendant.

The Student Library Committee is definitely
group which has the obligation to work for the formula.

the

tion and implementation of these various proposals. In
the selection of next year's Library Committee it is hoped
that the role of the committee as an active and progres
sive body will be stressed, and that those who serve on

this committee will seck to broaden ifs area of concern,

to a student who would have made
close to a Dean’s List average the
next semester, and it may have re-
instated a lazy slob.

Human Factor

The tragedy in this process was
the complete absence of the human
factor. The members of the com-
mittee may have been big hearted
and the nicest guys in the world.
They may have been crying their
eyes out in the committee room.
Nevertheless, any well oiled machine
could have come up with the same
results.

The standards of academic excel-
lence at Washington and Lee are
soaring, but nevertheless it will nev-
er be able to match Harvard or Yale,
Nobel Prize winner for Nobel Prize
winner. However, there is one asset
W&L can offer a student which
Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Berk-
eley can never offer: W&L is
small enough to give each student
individual attention and _ concern.
We should make the most of this
asset.

Large Schools More Concerned

Ironically, the larger schools show
more concern for their individual
students than W&L in the way they
determine who must go. Harvard,
Yale, Stanford, and Dartmouth have
the philosophy that any student who
has the qualifications to be at their
school is a superior student worth
salvaging.

While Washington and Lee boots
out 15% of its student body accord-
ing to the Comparative Guide to
American Colleges, these five other
schools almost take the attitude of
refusing to let go of any student
without first putting up a fight. The
expulsion rates range from a low at
Stanford of 2% over a period of four
years to a high at Dartmouth of 10%
(incidentally, the rate is similarly
low at the good small schools: 2%
of Pomona’s students must leave for
academic reasons, 3% leave at Wes-
leyan, 4% at Amherst and at Wil-
liams, and 5% at Davidson).

Perhaps back in the era of play-
boys and hell raisers when any fool
with money could get into college
these rules were needed. Today,
however, Washington and Lee's
policy should reflect the high quality
of its students. If 15% of the student

Hard and Fast Rules

Now, I am not saying that Wash-
ington and Lee should let everyone
stay and become a haven for lazy
geniuses. It just seems to me that
expulsion or suspension should be
based on a study of each individual’s
capabilities, performance, and poten-
tial; not upon a hard and fast rule.
The committee may claim that the
rule is not hard and fast, that a
number of students are re-instated.
Nevertheless, no matter how many
individual cases were supposedly
considered, re-instatements were giv-
en students primarily by lowering
the cutoff point.

Virginia has won him over to our
side for the time being.
—Dean Blitzgrieg.

“Come down, you weenie!” A
large group of students had crowd-
ed around the science building by
the time Dean Rodriguez arrived.
About half-way up one wall he
spotted Hotdog, humming and rub-
bing his hands together.

“Now listen, Hotdog! I don’t relish
the idea of calling the fire depart-
ment! But if you don’t come down
right now, I'll be forced into it!”

Hotdog spit noisily and climbed
even higher.

“No flies on him!” The attitude of
the mob had made an abrupt change.
The freshman had deliberately dis-
obeyed the Dean’s order.

Rodriguez took a quick puff on his
cigarette, then threw it away. “All
right. Call in the fire department.”

A nightmarish scene followed. In
the dark, all around the foot of the
Science Building, stood policemen,
students, members of the faculty,
firemen, hundreds of townspeople
who had been awakened by the
sirens and shouting. Up above them,
framed in the beam of a spotlight,
was Hotdog, motionless except for
an occasional discharge of spittle, his
body pressed tightly against the
brick wall.

“It's no use! We don’t have a
ladder long enough to reach him!”
The fire chief threw up his hands,
then shoved them into his pockets.

“What about the hoses?” Dean
Rodriguez leaned over and pulled up
a big clump of grass, stuffed it into
his mouth and began chewing on it
nervously.

stay up there long once he’s cov-

The fire chief was right. Too right.
Hotdog began screaming and quiver-
ing as soon as the foam spray hit
his body, then, clawing at his
spiracles, he fell ninety feet to his
death and shriveled into a ball.

“Well how about it, Dean Rodri-

The Times-Dispatch reporter held|

Rodriguez nudged Hotdog’s re-

the dawn light. “Son, that’s some-|

Yale’s catalogue is equally non-

college year a student may be drop-

ion of the faculty, the student’s rec-
ord is sufficiently unsatisfactory.”

Pomona College has a _ system
worth studying. A Joint Committee
of the college views the work of
every student whose average is be-
low a “C.” According to acting Dean
of Students Shelton L. Beatty, “Be-
fore the Joint Committee meets each
semester, the student’s dean studies
his record with eare, often has in-
terviewed the student and his fac-;

sponsor if he is a freshman, plus|

how to help the student succeed,|

caprice can never be put off by the
pleadings of sanity.

Becket assumes the position
against his will, fearful that the
will confront something that he
will not be able to overcome iwth
a well-turned phrase. Appre-
hensively, he begins his duties
and is soon confronted wtih the
problem of excommunicating one
of the king's nobles.

The remaining half of the movie
deals with the conflict between two
old acquaintances, Henry and Beck-
et, impulse and rationally, opposing
each other in a perennial struggle.

ing. If the deficiencies are more
serious, a student is put on proba-
tion. In a few cases the committee
advises a _ student to withdraw.
However, “If the student, after con-
sidering his status, should decide not
to withdraw, he may continue on
probation.”

In the most serious cases, accord-
ing to Dean Beatty, “If the student
lies down on the job and really
shows no intention of working to
save himself, or if his situation looks
nearly hopeless, we thoroughly
study his case, and in the few in-
request (i.e. require) him
to withdraw.”

Thus the committee at Pomona
has a much more difficult job than
its counterpart at W&L. The com-
mittee members can’t hide behind a
bureaucratic shield and say, “I’m
sorry, but there's nothing we can do.
We've got to uphold the rules, you
know.”

Next week I shall examine what I
consider one of our university’s most
inhumane and unjust policies: its
treatment of first semesier freshmen.

before the period ended. There was
no scoring in the second period, as
the contest became a defensive ef-
fort by both teams.

The vistors tallied twice in the
third quarter. A revitalized home
team took the field at the start of
the final quaarier, and it appeared as
if they might score an upset victory
when Robertson leaped high in the
air to score and LaMonte dodged}
his defenseman to score the fourth |
General goal. But the visitors’ lone
tally in the fourth quarter was the|
margin of victory.

to his experiences during his 18-moth
campaign bid for the Illinois gover-
ship, his first plunge into active poli-
tics.

“Your day just never ends,” he said.
“‘T've never seen anything like it in
business.”

He said that even though he was
defeated, the campaign brought about
some changes in Illinois. He cited the
initiation of a “literacy” retaining pro-
gram giving school dropouts a second
chance to further their education,
increased state support of education,
bipartican support of industrial devel-
opment and the beginnings of reform
legislation to purge criminal elements
in Cook County and Chicago.

Commenting on the future of the
national Republican party, Percy said
that “because we are in the minority,
we have to be a party that proposes,
not just one that opposes. We must be
a party of good ideas.” Percy said the
party must reorganize at the grass-
roots level to bring all races and na-
tionalities into the fold.

to remain. The Royal Lao govern-
ment opened the areas under its
control to all Laotian factions and
to the International Control Com-
mission. The Communists on the
other hand have forbidden access to
the areas under their control, not
only to the Prime Minister of Laos,
but to the International Control
Commission.

Domnio Theory

The domino thedry which states
that if we lose Viet-Nam, the other
nations of Asia will follow, is held
by many of our top military and
diplomatic leaders. The United
States must make a stand some-
where, and it will be easier now than
later. As Mr, Charles Percy said
here on Friday, patience is the key
to victory in South Viet-Nam.

The situation is incredibly com-
plex and may grow more so before
a final solution is reached. It seems
to me, however, that our govern-
ment must make one of two choices.
We can either continue to aid the
people of South Viet-Nam in an at-
tempt to protect thir freedom, or
we can negotiate a withdrawal on
the condition that Hanoi and the Red
Chinese stop aiding the rebels thus
enabling the Communists to gain an-
other foothold in Indonesia.

War. It is reported his coolness
and bravery saved a remnant of
Braddock’s badly - beaten army.
The uniform also was well-made

Washington then had just turned
10. He was still a British subject.
His role in the American Revolu-

president still lay ahead of him.

Peale was the leading historical
artist of the time. And although
some critics have termed the por-
trait “uninspired,” with Washing-
ton’s character hidded behind the
expressionless face, Washington's
favorite nephew, Curtis, noted that
“this splendid and most interesting
