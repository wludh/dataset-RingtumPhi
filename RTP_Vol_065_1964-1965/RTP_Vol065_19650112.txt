‘Compete in Speech Contest
Annual Event Last Night

The speech classes of Washing-

' ton and Lee and VMI participated in

the annual speech night at VMI last
evening. Following this
up, last night, beth schools sent mem-

i bers of their Argumentative Speech

classes to speak and refute several
topics.

On Wednesday night VMI and
WEL each presented two prepared
speeches and one impromptu speech
with humor as the theme of the
evening. For Washington and Lee,
Walt Bennett spoke on “Wlegance
in Politics” and Joe Bear followed
with a satirical talk on French Pres-
ident Charles de Gaulle. W&L's im-
promptu speaker was Roland Corn-
ing, who gave a profound lecture
on “Why VMI Should Accept Co-
eds and Have a Co-educational Ca-
det Corps.”

In last night's program both schools
presented three speeches which were
in turn refuted by students from the
opposing team. From WAL Jim De
Young spoke on “Why VMI Should

of humor. His career began in the
thirties, the same time as Glen Mil-
ler’s. On one occasion his career
was almost nipped in the bud when
gangsters invaded the night club
where McKinley was playing and
sent a stray bullet his way. The bul-
let hit McKinley in the leg.

During World War Il McKinley,
already a friend of Miller, was a
sergeant under Miller, who was a
major. After the War McKinley was
a logical choice to take over the
Glenn Miller Orchestra.

In reply to a rumor that the
Lettermen would not appear at the
concert Saturday night, Dance Board
vice president Jim Crothers stated
flatly that the Lettermen will be in
Doremus Gym for the concert Sat-
urday afternoon at two o'clock.

 

 

Mr. Mattingly in Hospital,
Hoped To Return Shortly

Last Sunday the University
Treasurer and Secretary Eari S.
Mattingly was hospitalized with
minor heart trouble. He is present-
ly at Stonewall Jackson Memorial
hospital where he will rest until
Friday when, his doctor said, he
will probably go home.

Mr. Mattingly became student
assistant in the Treasurer's office in
1917. In 1920 he was appointed
Registrar, and in 1940 he became
Secretary and Treasurer.

During his long stay in Lexing-
ton with Washington and Lee, Mr.
Mattingly has been very active in
the local hospital and R .E. Lee
Memorial Church.

The hospital listed his condition
as “very satisfactory.”

An all free-Hungarian company, the
Hungarian Ballet Bihari now touring
the United States for the second time,
will make an appearance here next
Wednesday night, Jan. 13, at Waddell
School. The performance at 8:15 p.m.,
' will be the second presentation of the
| Rockbridge Concert-Theater Series.

The troupe, which stars the renown-
ed Nora Kovach and Istan Rabovsky,
| is unusual in that all its members, in-
cluding seven musicians, have defect-
ed from Communist-controlled Hun-
gary. It is also the only ensemble to
combine strictly folk elements—native
dances, authentic costumes and gypsy
orchestra—with the professionalism of
classical ballet.

The New York Times recently said
of the company’s performance: “Dazzl-
ing technique that continually churned
up applause.”

Kovach and Rabovsky, in private
life husband and wife, were both
born in Hungary and met while stu-
dents at the Budapest Opera Ballet.
Their promise was so great that they
were selected by the Soviet baller-
ina, Ulaneva, to continue their stud-
ies with the Leningrad Ballet Com-
pany. Subsequently, they became

as a Consultant to the Secretary
of State.

In 1955 he received a Guggenheim
Fellowship to study the interaction
press and government in Washing-
ton, and in 1957-58, he spent nearly
a year traveling around the world
on an Eisenhower Fellowship.

Mr. Cater is the author, or co-
author of three books: Power in
Washington, written in 1963 while he
was a Fellow at Wesleyan Center
for Advanced Studies; The Fourth
Branch of Government, written in
1959; and Ethics in a Business So-
ciety co-authored by him and Mar-
quis Childs.

In 1961 he was awarded a special
Ceorge Polk Memorial Award “for
bringing clarity to the complexities
of big government.”

In commenting on the topic
chosen, Brownell said that Mr.
Cater will attempt to deal with
increasing sensitivity of our na-
tional government to all the inter-
related affairs of national devel-
opment, and the increasing re-
sponse of Washington to national
problems.

“He plans a broad treatment of
increasing federal responsibility
it means for our federal system, and
what it means for the American fu-
ture,” Brownell added.

Mr. Cater is also expected to
make an attempt to illustrate this
development by differentiating be-
tween the New Freedom, the New
Deal and The Great Society.

Last week it was announced by
Brownell that Col. Francis P. Miller,
a Special assistant in the Department
of State, also has accepted an invita-
tion to speak at the Contact weekend.

Col. Miller’s address will be, said
Brownell, “Americans Abroad and
Their Task.” Col. Miller is a 1914 grad-
uate of Washington and Lee and was
W&L’s first Rhodes Scholar.

The Phantom”
Strikes Again

By FRANK L. FAIRCHILD, JR.

Condemning the “hypocrisy and
stagnation” of the W&L student
bedy, a phantom writer has recently
barraged tthe bulletin board and the
Ring-tum Phi with a series of pro-
test notices. A similar phantom ini-
tiated a campaign last November
with a letter addressed to the edi-
tors of the Ring-tum Phi under the
pseudonym “Oliver Wordwork.”
Since the author refused to reveal
his true identity, the letter was
withheld from publication.

In the first epistle, the Angry
Young Man (Woodwork) castigated
the “currupt image of the pseudo-
stud.” He accused the student body
of leading a “purposeless existence”
lacking the “moral principals (sic.)
which here seem useless.” However,
the phantom is not without hope. He
feels that “the whole lousy social
system” can be changed, if the stu-
dents will “stand up and say and
do what they want to.”

Failing to receive the attention of
the student body through the Ring-
tum Phi, the anonymous writer
seems to have turned to the bulle-
tin board. In his most recent notice,
the critic continues to bemoan the
“outdated” social system of W&L
Indirectly criticizing the Ring-tum
Phi for not printing (his) unsigned
letters, he accused the schools “es-
tablished leaders” of erasing indi-
vidualism. Quick to point out that
he is not endorsing riots or “even
free love,” the phantom asserts that
his ultimate purpose in writing is to
encourage the students to “speak
out and demand fair opportunity to
express and maintain their individ-
ualiem,”

A Modest Proposal

Enthusiasm has begun to build up a little early for the
1968 Mock Convention. The organization which has
mushroomed for “pre-convention” planning during the
last few months is nothing short of fantastic. Now it’s
about time to sit back for a minute and evaluate the pre-
convention program which began last fall with the modest
intention of providing for “interim coordination” between
the 1964 convention and the 1968 affair.

One interim coordinator turned into two, and they
both needed assistants. Then, of course, there had to be
regional managers and financial managers, and more as-
sistants. The end of it is that the mock convention, four
years ahead of time, possesses an organization which will
have to be called a bureaucracy if it is padded with just
one more layer of appointments. In such an organiza-
tion—especially since it has no concrete or inherited duties
and hence cannot move by intertia—there is always the
danger that each man will expect everybody else to do all
the work.

Aside from the danger of the mere size of this organ-
ization, there is the much greater possibility that enthus-
iasm for the mock convention may well burn itself out
long before 1968, at the rate things are going now. Last
year’s steering cmmittee found it very difficult to keep
the student body interested in the convention for one
year; it is hard to see how the present interim coordina-
tors are going to prevent people from getting a little
bored with the convention unless they slow down fast.
After all, four year’s work is a lot of preparation for a
two-day convention.

There are three long years before any appreciable
results from all the work under the interim coordinators
will be noticable. This is a long period for a student organ-
ization to remain in the planning stage. It will be difficult,
but by no means impossible, for the profits of so long
planning to be realized.

If the two interim coordinators are able to overcome
these problems the 1968 mock convention has a head
start on any past W&L convention and possibly on any
mock convention in the country. These gentlemen have
generated a huge responsibility for themselves, one which
is much more than an affair of “interim coordination.”
They have begun to lay the foundation for the conven-
tion itself. The coordinators—Dave Mayfield and Steve
Saunders—are men of great talent and initiative, and
if they can keep up the fast pace they have set for them-
selves, there is no question that the 1968 convention
will be the best one in history. But Mayfield and Saunders
must be careful that in their planning they do not neglect
the new problems which have arisen out of the very fact
of such an early and such a fast start.

 

 

The Iron Is Hot

The announced plan of the administration to put the
University Supply Store back on campus in the “old
Co-op” building behind the library is the answer to a very
old complaint from the student body. Having the Co-op
back on campus will be a great convenence to everybody,
in addition to pleasing those utilitarians among us who
think it’s about time the empty “old Co-op” was put to
some use. But we think the administration is ing a
mistake in planning to move the ROTC department
into the rear of the student union building after it is
vacated by the present Co-op.

Since the Co-op is to move out of the student union,
this vacancy would seem, to provide the ideal moment to
answer another very old complaint of the student body:
that the facilities of the student union are inadequate.
The location of the present Co-op is the only one which
could be almost immediately, and relatively inexpensively,
turned into a real student union—i.ec., one with some
manner of recreational facilities other than a television.
Because this location is actually a part of the building
which presently houses the entire “student union,” there
would be no question of having to build a completely
new student union building. It would be a simple matter
to install pool tables, ping-pong tables, a juke box, and
other recreational equipment or even study carrels.

Non-fraternity students have been clamoring for a
student union for years. If they were finally given one,
probably it would not become the most-frequented place
in Lexington. Nevertheless, those who would use a stu-
dent union deserve some attention, There just isn’t any
place for them to go now. And there is no doubr that if
the student union were to be equipped with recreational
facilities, freshmen and some fraternity men would like to
use it also.

This step would not provide any palace of wonders, to
be sure, but it seems to be the only possibility of improv-
ing student union facilities for the near future, Surely
some other location could be found for the ROTC
outfit than the only one now available for the student
union. The students of Washington and Lee, particularly
the increasing percentage who do not belong to a frater-
nity, deserve something more than the town of Lexington
offers.

 

 

By C. W. MORRISON
History Department

In his article in the January 8
issue of the Ring-tum Phi Warren
Montgomery put his fingers on a
very real problem in the educa-
tion process at Washington and
Lee, the relationship between string-
ent grading and intellectual apathy
on the part of the students. Stringent
grading does frequently lead to stu-
dent apathy, perhaps through some
such process as Mr. Montgomery
describes. And yet I cannot agree
with his proposed solution that pro-
fessors should use good grades as
an incentive for students.

One difficulty with the solution
is immediately obvious. Human be-
ings have different psychological
makeups, one student’s incentive is
not another’s. The B that inspires
one student to new prodigies leaves
another complacent. Should the pro-
fessor try to take account of indi-
vidual psychological differences?
Even supposing that he could do this
successfully, this policy points to-
ward a reductio ad absurdum where
two students of equal performance
but different psychological needs
would be given different grades to
increase their interest and make
both work harder.

But Mr. Montgomery evidently
does not intend any such injustice.
His conclusion suggests that he wants
professors to give higher grades gen-
erally rather than on the basis of
individual need. Presumably, most of

Grades Measure Achievement ©
Should Not Become Incentive |

the students would then show great-
er interest in the course and conse-
quently do better work. With a
student body as grade oriented as
that of Washington and Lee, this is
a questionable presumption. Even
if it were not, however, the propos-
al would be wrong because it is
based upon a misconception of grad-

ing.

Although the professor has a re-
sponsibility to try to encourage rath-
er than discourage his students, he
should not use grades for this pur-
pose. The purpose of grades is total-
ly unrelated to incentive, however
great the consequences of grades
are upon incentive. The grade is
not, as Mr. Montgomery would have
it, a “reward,” the professor’s vote
of confidence in the intelligence, cur-
iosity, and will to work of the stu-
dent. The grade cannot and should
not measure these factors directly.
It measures instead the student’s
achievement, according to certain
standards determined by the pro-
fessor.

Ideally, the student earns his grade
by demonstrating his ability to
think in terms of the particular sub-
ject matter of the course. Many stu-
dents do not understand this fun-
damental distinction between in-
put and output. They think that a
certain input, some combination of
work, interest, and _ intelligence,
should guarantee them a good grade.
But it does not. They are rated on
output or performance.

Cinema Columnist Turns Literary Critic

 

 

Since some students do manage to
make their imput combination pro-
duce an output which meets the
professor’s standards for good work,
do succeed in that difficult and mys-
terious process which we call getting
an education, it would be paently un-
just, as well as unfair to the class
as a whole, to rate them with those
who do not.

It seems to me that the problem
of student apathy resulting from
stringent grading arises largely out
of the student’s overvaluation of
grades, coupled with their misun-
derstanding of what the grade rep-
resents. Too many students strive
primarily for grades which they mis-
interpret as representing this pro-
fessor’s attitude toward their efforts
and talents. They try to discover
precisely what it is that their pro-
fessor “wants” so that they can win
his approval by giving it to him. But
what the professor really wants is
not a student working to please
him but one trying to acquire an
understanding of his course. This
involves seeking knowledge rather
than grades.

It is difficult to believe that profes-
sors can bribe students into seeking
knowledge with good grades. What
is required is not the professor's
acquiescence in the student's over-
valuation of grades but their insist-
ence that the quest for grades be
subordinated to the quest for knowl-
edge.

Grayson Powell, is “a nice balance of
erotic and sedate poetry,” which is
not far from the truth, The short
stories, two of them to be exact,
are interesting and a short review of
Aidous Huxley's recent essay, “Lit-
erature and Science,” closes out the
issue .

This year's first Ariel leads off with
a semi-satirie brain twister by Reb-
ert Mac Rives. a
Kappa Sig senior.
Glatteisgefhar is a
“stream -oaf -consci-
ousness” type
short story that
directs its wit al-
ternately on
American travel-
ers in Europe, col-
lege poker play-
ers, basketball ace
Joe Tutt, and
amateur film erit-

 

Newman

ies.
Foreword with LaRue
The foreword to the story, written
supposedly by Lache LaRue, (notice

how well this goes with Rives), gives
a hint to the author’s own disinctive
style: “incoherent in parts, naive in
others...what one must describe
as highly disjointed short stories,
completely deficient in classical vir-
tues of balance and restraint, and,
en the whole little more than trans-
parent disguises of his own control-
led adventures.” At any rate, we
may not always keep up with
Glatteisgefahr's X-KE, but we en-
joy the chase anyway.

Jim Ledbetter, co-editer, submits
the second piece of experimental fie-
tion, The Vision, Ledbetter has crea-
ed an introspective, rather poetic
character named Jeff Logan, who
ends up talking to Mr, Magoo on a
park bench. No, Logan is not one
af those homosexuals, but he does
seem to take on a real life in The
Vision. Ledbetter’s style is enter-
taining and he shows talent at char-
acterization.

“Birth and Death”

The central poetic contribution to
this issue of Ariel is the work of
Liewllyn Smith. The three poems in-
eluded won the 1964 Mahan Award
for Smith. The poet seems obsessed
with the ideas of birth and death,
and images such as “burial in moth-

and Rives

er” and “halfway to birth” give pun-
gency to his work. “A Circumcision”
is Smith's most compact and success-
ful poem of the three printed, speak-
ing ritualistically of birth and death.

The Erotic Side

Two poems by Hollins junior Joni
Raffeld and one by Hollin’s gradu-
ate student Louis Milton Bourne de-
velop relatively quiet, reflective
themes in comparison to the delight-
fully playful and sensuous “Yawned
and Pillowheaded” by Tobe Glasser.
Tobe is actually not the poet, ac-
cording to rumor, and the poem is
by an anonymous Sweet Briar sen-
ior. “Pillowheaded” is rich in imag-
ery and suggestive alliteration, per-
fect fireside reading for a warm date

The final selection is a review of
Aldous Huxley's “Literature and
Science” by W&L junior 8. F. Par-
ham. Parham quickly seans the basic
tenets of the essays and ends by
repeating Gertrude Stein's criticiem
of Huxley's inorganic view of lil-
erature,

The fall edition of Ariel is well
worth the 75 cents per copy that
it now sells for at the library, Co-op.
Book Shop, and Commons. We will
all look forward to the winter edi-
tion, which reportedely will be com-
pletely devoted to satire.

  

After Good Start
A gain A Decline

By LAMAR LAMB

Tuesday Columnist
After an auspicious beginning
this year, the Executive Committee
has slowly declin-
ed into what it
has been in former
years. Once again,
few students dis-
cuss issues of
campus politics
because _ they
aren’t aware of
exactly what is
going on. Now
perhaps, it is be-
cause most stu-
dents don’t take
time to try to find out what the
Executive Committee is doing.
Nevertheless the EC has done little
to positively present for debate or
thought any realm of campus life.
Most members of the EC take ser-
iousily their duty to preserve the
traditions and supervise the student
government at Washington and Lee.
But most of the members of the EC
don’t recognize that a necessary part
of that duty is periodically question-
ing the student government to see
if it is meeting contemporary needs,
and questioning traditions ‘to see if
they are being effectively used in
the improvement of the modern
student generation and just pre-

served for their own sake.

The error most members of the EC
make, at least as long as I have
been here, is not one of intention
or laziness. It is, rather, one of at-
titude. Because they realize that
they have a great deal of power
and, thus, responsibility, they usual-
ly are willing to sacrifice a great
deal of time and effort to do what
they see as their duty. But because
they spend so much time thinking
about the honor system or some of
the various traditions we have, they
tend to lose sight of the real purpose
and ultimate justification for these
things.

While I was on the EC, I noticed
in myself and others the tendency
to forget that the purpose of the
Honor System was to preserve
freedom and not just to protect old
ways. When a group of people,
such as the EC, work long and
hard to apply a system to a stu-
dent body, there is a tendency to
think in terms of that system, and
not of the student body. So, when
questions of innovation or appli-
cation come up, it is easy to think
about what will best preserve
“The System,” and not how it will
most aid the student body.

Furthermore, because most mem-
bers of the EC are acutely sensitive
about their supposed duty to pre-
serve any and all traditions, they
tend to regard any suggested inno-
vation with hostility, just because it
is new. Somehow, anything new is
a challenge to an established way
which our leaders are supposed to
defend. That is why we rarely see
innovations coming from the EC.
Any changes in our student govern-
ment have usually come from either
the student body itself, or occasion-
ally, from the administration. And,
because neither the regular students
nor the administration are nearly as
concerned with student government
as is the EC, we rarely see any in-
novation, or, indeed, any question-
ing at all.

The ironic part of this whole prob-
lem is that of the nature of tra-
ditien itself. Since we are merely
students, and since we are closely
acquainted with Washington and
Lee for only a very few years, we
don't really know what things were
like even ten years ago, Certainly,
we ean't know the original purpose
of a long-established system

We don't know for instance,
when or for what reasons, con-
ventional dress as a system or hon-
or as a system were established
here. All we are given is an es-
tablished way of doing things by
the immediately preceeding stu-
dent generation—a way which has
been perhaps greatly distorted and
perverted through the years. Yet
we revere this system as good be-
cause it is old and was established
by the people who went before us.

Perhaps an innovater such as Lee
would be greatly disappointed by
what he would find teday at Wash-
ington and Lee. Perhaps we have
taken good ideas from people such
as Lee and thought only of the sys-
tem established and net the reagons
why it was established. I we have
done that, then we have perverted
the system and rendered it harm-
ful instead of useful.

I don't know if this is what has
happened at Washington and Lee
My point is that no one else knows
either, Our leaders have not ques-
tioned the possibility of this. Ne
one has studied the past te find out
why our traditions got started. Per.
haps if we did study the past we
would find that what nobility can

Livingston played his greatest col-

hit on 14 of 21 shots from ‘the floor

The Generals were down eight

Generals Lose to RPI
Saturday the Generals traveled to
Richmond and returned with their
tenth consecutive defeat. Their op-
ponents, RPI, turned out with a

defense that was good enough to
stop Livingston and company. The|
hosts made 43 of 66 from the floor |
and added 17 free throws for their
103-77 triumph. The Ge nerals tried|
to match the winners’ 65 per cent
with 36 per cent from the floor.

Team Effort Spurs Victory

Taking a 2-2 record into Tarhell territory yesterday, W&L’s
swimming team downed the Deacons of WakeForest, 53-45 to
push the Generals above the .500 mark for the season.

The charges of Coach Norris Eastman blasted Wake For-
est in the opening medley relay and were never seriously

threatened throughout the remainder of the meet. Bill Wild-
*rick followed with a first in the

200-yard freestyle with freshman
Tom Edwards placing third. Skip
Chase and Gary Bokinsky finished
second and third in the 50-yard
free as did their teammates George
Bokinsky and Kester Denman in
the 200-yard individual medley.

Depth Helps To Win

Depth proved the Generals long
suit again as diver Rich Stevens
and Noel Clinnard placed second
and third respectively as did Bill
Clay and Howard Busse in the fol-
lowing 200-yard butterfly. The Dea-
cons saw their charge of five con-

secutive firsts collapse in the face
of W&L’s rally which captured
the next three events.

Leading the Generals’ comeback

was co-captain Andy Broaddus who
touched out freshman Nelson Head
in a one-two finish for W&L in the
| 200-yard backstroke. Next came Ned
Lawrence and Edwards who swept
the 500 freestyle followed by fel-
low freshman Denman who captured
first in the 200-yard breaststroke.
Swimming unofficially Chase, Wild-
rick, Joe Huston and Taylor finished
first in the final 400-yard freestyle
relay, thus rounding out a good day
for W&L swimming.

The swimmers next meet is this
Saturday against subsidized and
powerful East Carolina at 2 p.m.

Notice

No change in registration, it has
been announced by Dean Pusey’s of-
fice, will be made between the dates of
January 7, 1965, and February 1, 1965.

and vary the content of seminar, but
provide samples of professional oral

To the Editor:
I question the conclusion that “C.

W. M.” reaches in his Friday-edition

'| editorial (December 11, 1964).

His contention that the votes for
proposals 1, 2, and 3 (supporting the
convention of Conevntional Dress)

|| should “strengthen its enforcement” is

illogical. Sixty-five per cent of the
votes indicated—at minimum—a desire
for “some change in the present op-
eration of the committee” (i.e. the en-
forcement), and 40 per cent voted for
the abolishment of the committee.

I also question the method of assess- |

ing the results of the referendum. The
Assimilation Committee should not be
in the position of interpreting criticisms
of itself which threaten its future ex-
istence. The Executive Council called
for the referendum, administered it,
and should interpret its results.
Sincerely yours,
ED DODD, JR.

speaks only briefly about his films;
“The intellectualising of line and
and space, composition, tempo, etc.
is all very well, but it has little to
do with acting, and is liable to fall
into an arid dogma. Simplicity of ap-
proach is always best ...Time saving
in films is still the basic virtue.
Both Eisenstein and Griffith knew
it. Quick cutting and dissolving from
one scene to another are the dynam-
ies of film technique...I am sur-
prised ‘that some critics say that my
camera technique is old-fashioned,
that I have not kept up with the
times. What times? My technique is
the outcome of thinking for myself,
of my own logic and approach; it
must not be borrowed from what
others are doing. If in art one must
keep up with the times, then Rem-
brandt would be a back number
compared with Van Gogh.”

scriptions of who he knows and
where he goes. Yet these extrava-
gances are permissable in light of
his frightening childhood as re-
counted above.

Of all the people he mentions,
three are significantly absent, these
being Buster Keaton (a Limelight
eo-star), Stan Laurel (a former
companion in England) and Harry
Langdon. But then, no other living
comedian is ever mentioned, either,
as if he paid no attention to his
fellow actors. He cannot be envious,
for he is clearly superior to all of
them in anybody’s mind. He seems
to be discreetly ignoring his contem-
poraries.

He speaks regrettably about his
first marriage to Mildred Harris, and
with warm affection about his pres-
ent marriage to Ona O’Neill, whom
he married when she was 19 and
he was 50. He speaks frankly about
his paternity suit with Joan Barry
and of his political harrassment in
this country, but they are obviously

his side of the story.

Aside from ‘this, My Autobiogra-
phy is a fine and often astounding
book. He has a self-educated love
of words which makes them used
for beauty as for precision. There
is his introspective philosophy which
injures many of his oldest fans, but
provides us with many interesting
epigrams worth remembering. Albove
all, it bears the indelible stamp of
Charles Chaplin and this alone may
make it one of the few enriching

Tomorrow’s forecast could read “Below-freezing temperatures, and
snow turning to sleet late in the afternoon.” No doubt about it,
winter is well on its way. And no self-respecting college man wants
to be caught looking through the glass darkly when the big freeze
hits. So, a few fashion tips on your cold-weather wardrobe are in
order. Let’s take a quick run-down on the trends we outerwear for

the months ahead.

THE THIN RED LINE plummets toward zero,

but you'll be snug in your campus tow coat—the
cold-weather cover-all. This new “tops-every-
thing” coat is a lineal descendant of the “Ski
Look.” Its basically bulky, masculine lines are
combined with feather-light weight. The tow
coat is readily identifiable by its length, which
is short—at most, 88”—breaking just above the
knee. All-wool or polyester cotton fabrics,
usually in a twill or poplin weave, are the most
popular in both single and double breasted
styles. Color preferences range from tan
through dark blue, black, and Loden green.

 

THE BIG NEWS IS THE BIG S-T-R-E-T-C-H in all kinds of fabrics,
which along with the “Ski Look,” are creating a major revolution
in sportswear. One-way S-T-R-E-T-C-H is the horizontal give-and-
take found in the new ski-inspired jackets. In general, jackets tend
toward greater length this year in both belt and zipper front styles.
Their added elasticity affords plenty of extra shoulder room. Blue,
black, brown and natural tan are the dominant colors. Ski jackets
feature concealed hoods which roll into the collar. Quilted fabrics of
nylon or polyester cottons continue the popular trend in diagonal
and oblong patterns. Professional type stretch ski pants, under-
stated in dark grey, dark blue, and black, are slimmer and trimmer,
maintaining the tapered look, along with greater ease and comfort

at points of stress.

SOUND THE TRUMPETS for the big swing back to leather. Leather
sport coats and jackets as well as longer coats in brushed suede and
grained leather are definitely in. Leather accessories are big too:
bindings on collars, closures, button-holes and sleeves add a dis-
tinetive and practical touch. For the more conservative—and for
the more formal oceasion—woolen top coats in a raglan sleeve,
natural-shoulder, single-breasted bold new Herringbone are getting

| the nod. The Herringbone measures about an inch wide and is made
| of black and white or grey coarse yarns. Traditional campus styling

includes flapped pockets and a fly front. And, of course, the fleece-
type camel hair coat remains a campus classic.

 

THIS SIDE OF PARADISE the well-dressed col-
lege man will be properly hatted against win-
ter’s icy fury. The “suede swinger” constructed
on a firm yet flexible nylon frame, is made of
velvety suedes and brushed leathers in natural

shades to coordinate with all kinds of leather
and textured sportswear fabrics. A small crown, a narrow brim,
and a snap-band complete the picture.

THE CALL OF THE WILD comes through loud
and clear in the HOOT BOOT. Great for foot-
ball games and trudging through midwinter
slush, the HOOT BOOT is an example of the
ideal marriage of fashion and function. This
2-eyelet demi-boot has a shorter rise than last
year’s models, pointed up by a turnback welt
seam. Unlined or—for the cold-weather campus
~—lined with fleece or shearling, the HOOT
BOOT features grained, plain or brushed leath-
ers, with leather or rubber sole. Soft, subtle

 

heather mixtures of HOOT Hose are emphasized by their fleecy
finish. They are the answer to the perennial campus demand for

practical, easy-care hose.

That's it for the latest word on outerwear. Next month, in plenty
of time to prepare you for the up-coming whirl of holiday celebra-
tions, we'll take a close look at the formalwear scene. See you then.
