Membership
Referendum
Wins 790-243

By an overwhelming majority, the
student body in yesterday's election
voted in favor of the proposed |
change in the EC representation
with regard to the Law School and
undergraduate groups. However,
the EC-sponsored referendum aimed
at bringing the operations of estab-
lished political parties into the open
for equal participation by all fac-
tions failed to receive the necessary
majority vote and was thus defeated.

The referendum to change the
EC membership to give a greater
representation to the sophomore class
of the undergraduate school was
approved by 790 students as opposed
to only 243 against it. As a result of
this voting, the two EC members of
the Intermediate and Senior Law
Classes will be combined, with the
other place being allocated to the
Sophomore Class. The EC total mem-
bership will still remain at 10 but] ~
now the sophomores will have two
representatives and the Law School
two.

This change was proposed by the
EC late this winter after a discussion
in January regarding the dispropor-
tionately large voice held by law
students in determining what are
mostly undergraduate affairs. For-
merly the Law School had nearly
one-third of EBC membership while
holding only 13 per cent of student
body membership.

In the other major referendum
vote, the student body flatly rejected
a plea by the EC to force campus
political parties to 1) register with
the EC, 2) report a list of all ex-
penditures to the EC for approval,
and 3) hold open attendance and
nomination primaries.

Although the vote itself was passed
by 538 to 483, it failed te achieve
the majority vote of 618 required
by EC ruling.

Commenting on the student body's
rejection of this proposed detriment
to what some call “clique” politics
controlling student elections, Univer-
sity Party president James Jennings
had this to say: “Aidmittedly campus
polities as it exists now is in a de-
plorable state, and a positive effort
should be made to correet the situa-
tion in the near future. However, as
evidenced by the results of student
balloting, the proposal put forth by
the EC was obviously not the right
answer.”

Uncle Som Chooses Six Seniors For Peace Corps

To Be Sacrificed In Turkey, Peru And Tanzania

By MIKE DUNN
Associate Editor

Why join the Peace Cerps?
“There's lot of idealism to it;”
-unsure about graduate school;”

“I wanted to see a way of living
different from a Southern small
town,” are some of the answers. Dr.
Milton C. Colvin, Peace Corps liaison
officer at W&L, describes it as having
just being a “young, energetic, ideal-
istic, and enthusiastic young Amer-
ican.”

Six seniors at Washington and Lee
have been notified by the Peace
Corps that they have been tentative-
ly accepted for service overseas.
Three of them, Ken Marion, Bill
Surbaugh, and Phil Siffling, are be-
ing sent to Turkey; while the re-
maining three, Andy Kilpatrick, Pete
Graeff, and Maleolm Morris, will go
to India, Peru, and Tanzania, respee-
tively.

Following graduation in June, each
student will attend a 40-60 day in-
tensive training peried intended to
provide basic understanding of the
language, customs, history, and eco-
nomie conditions of the country to
which each will go, as well as to
further test the student's ability to
live and work well with others. This
will be followed by on-the-spot
training in the host country.

Each of the six presently expects
to eventually teach at a primary 01
secondary level in the schools of the
eountry te which he is sent. What
they may actually end up doing

is practically no salary—you may
save up about $1,000 in a two-year
period of constatnt and difficult
work. In addition, volunteers live
among the local population, eating
the same food, living in the same
kind of housing, all of which is of-
ten totally different from the food
and housing to which they have
been accustomed.

Four other seniors are now await-
ing their notices of acceptance or
rejection. These will be notified by
the end of the semester. In addition,
over a dozen juniors have also indi-
cated an interest in the Peace Corps,
and will be eligible to apply next
year.

Dr. Colvin noted that W&L is only
reflecting a quickened interest in the
Peace Corps which extends all over
the country Haverford College, for

example, recently found that as many
of its graduating seniors went into
the Peace Corps as went into busi-
ness. “There are presently 7,000 vol-
unteers in the field, and 1,000 in the
pipeline,” he said. “The Peace Corps
hopes to have 10,000 in the field by
the end of this year.”

In recognition of this growing in-
terest, arrangements have been made
for two Peace Corps workers to visit
the school within the next few weeks.
On April 26, Peggy McNally, a grad-
uate of Duke University, will speak
on her work as an English teacher
in Costa Riea and the Philippines,
while on May 6, Mr. Stephen Giuld,
an alumnus of the class of 1963 at
W&L, and presently a recruiter with
the Peace Corps headquarters, will
speak about his experiences in Sierra

Party Politics proved its significance last night, as the Uni-

big one—the president.

Fred Mindel, a'ZBT from Toledo, Ohio, running indepen-
dent of clique backing, overwhelmed his opponent, Chuck
Walker, a Kappa Sig from San Antonio, Texas, with more
than a 200 vote margin- -half of Walker’s total vote.

‘Why Are You Crying?

One week he is reluctantly feted in At-
lanta as the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize,
and the next week he sits in a jail cell in Sel-
ma, Alabama.

Five years ago, it was a spot which was
hard to find on a map; today it is the location
of a war that is highly consequential in nature,
and yet at the same time has been termed
“silly,” 1965’s Spanish-American War” and
“damn ridiculous.”

Martin Luther King, Jr. tried to register
to vote—tried to lead a group of those who at
least enjoy the right, if not the actuality, of
voting. And, in the true Southern traditional
sense, he and hundreds of others were not
only denied this right, but also a peaceable as-
sembly.

The headlines are full of it—South Viet-
nam has become the focal point of the world’s
attention. “A brush-fire war” has become a
symbol, a bleeding symbol, where two giants
oppose each other on territory not their own.
The native people are puppets in a fight not
their own. Ridiculous? Highly.

The phrase “man’s inhumanity to man”
has meant little until we view such blatant in-
justice and wide-eyed defiance of all that is
human.

Perhaps with the approaching Springs
Dance Set, complete with the driving sound
of Chuck Berry, this is not the time to put
forth a question of man’s decency, his value
system. Maybe one should not be so naive as
to disturb the ritualistic joy of after-concert
outbursts and after-drinking bewilderment by
introducing such matters. After all, the stu-
dent says, we have pondered, crammed, burn-
ed the oil, have been sterile and scholarly ac-
cording to the catalog.

Now we deserve our period of forgetful-
ness and un-concern. The time is right for a
momentary stay against the pressures of theo-
ries and thinking. We need to drown the great
god Academia.

Now is the time, you say, to lay our minds
on a dusty shelf, amid the clutter of omnious
books and used 19¢ BIC’s. The mouth. . .
the ears .. . the eyes... the feet . . . the pel-
vis... the fingertips—these are Springs’ rul-
ers.

It will never work, College Man.

I see you when you arrive for the week-
end, you are already tired from your trip, but
you are lovely. You kiss me matter-of-factly,
but there is a promise in your eyes, and a
smile that longs to be smiled alone. At the
boardinghouse, Mrs. Wayland will take your
four dollars and let us know how glad she is
to see us again. She smiles on lovers.

I will show you our apartment, and I am
secretly proud when you tell me it looks sharp.
You will leave Chanel on the pillow, and I
will be sad on Sunday.

In Rochester, there was a little boy named
Sammy. He was a Negro. He would not speak,
except when he pulled on my sleeve and said,
“got a nickel?” His eyes were always half-
blank, half-questioning. I remember first meet-
ing him fighting with another child. I pulled
him away and picked him up. All he did was
open his mouth as wide as he could and utter
a silent scream. .. .

I carried him home on my back, and he
peed in his pants. On the front porch of his
house, his mother sat with her legs spread and
cleaned the meat out of the shell of a huge
turtle. The blood dripped off of the porch
onto the dusty ground where two near-naked
urchins played with another turtle shell. Sam-
my was crazy.

At the concert, you will wear your flower-
ed Villager blouse and your light blue A.
shaped skirt, and your hair will be long. We
will listen to the music muted by a thousand

intimate voices. Your eyes are bright, your
ear cold against my cheek. You look up with
wet, happy eyes and pass your lips—quietly,
softly—across my cheek. For a fleeting second
we are alone in the crowd, and I am filled with

wonder and with love.

The newspapers are filled with our guilt.
Birmingham, Jim Crow & Co. pride them-
selves on keeping order with fire-hoses and cat-
tle-prodders. Negroes are beaten, and the Klan
cheers. And still they come. “Keep your eyes
on the prize; hold on.” Philadelphia . . . The
three workers lie rotten in a shallow grave—
victims of fear and godless hatred. They will
not be tried for murder, not Rainey and Price.
“Life ’ runs a full-page photo of smiling Sher-
iff Rainey, his mouth full of “Red Man” chew-
ing tobacco. Little Rock seems so far away—a
long, bloody way away. Selma provides the
Washington Post headlines for two weeks.

Ain’t no black s.o.b. gonna stink up my
children s school!” ‘Kill ’em! Kill ’em”!

A single Negro looks into the mad crowd
of whites faces, they are ugly with fear and
hatred. “NIGGER,” they scream. His head
bows. “NIGGER! NIGGER! NIGGER!”

Response from Peking and now Hanoi to

the President’s speech indicate both Commu-
nist capitals have carefully examined Mr.
Johnson’s remarks and found in them no ba-
sis for negotiation. Communist China dramati-
cally underlined her no-negotiation posture on
the Vietnam war yesterday by slamming the
door in the face of would-be emissairies from
the United Nations and Great Britain. Power
plays within the South Vietnamese military
command today seemed to be gaining the kind
of momentum that has led to coups in the
past. .

They lay very still on the blanket. In the
distance they could hear the gaity and laughter
of a party. The moon’s hazy brilliance cast a
pale blue light through the thick pines, inter-
rupted only by an occasional strand of silken
cloud.

She turned slowly toward him. Her soft
hair fell across his forehead. They were silent.

“Why are you crying?” she said.

The | Election

Election time has come—and gone. Of-
ficers change but W&L’s lethargic attitude to-
wards elections, and more importantly to the
officers the students elect, continues as one of
the school’s most despicable conventions.

However much was heard about the Hon-
or System during the campaign, once again
an honorable election was stymied. It appears
that an effective, but untrue, rumor was cir-
culated in the Law School. “The Honor Sys-
tem here at W&L has as its primary reason

Flash! Politicians are exempt from the de-
mands of honor for a week.
This year the student body was offered a
distinctive choice in all three contests. This
campaign was not a battle of “I’m more status

quo, or I'm more conservative than my op-

for

ponent.” In the past the far, far right has
been a very crowded place during election
week. Last year, the far right won by a com
fortable margin; this year the moderate posi
tion won by the same margin.

The Ring-tum Phi extends its congratula
tions to Joe Frampton, Dave Marchese, and
particularly to Fred Mindel, who won without
benefit of an organized party or coerced vot
ers. Congratulations, particularly to you, Fred,
because you won because you are Fred Min.

The campaign was characterized by a pro
gressive spirit; may next year's stude
ment share that spirit.

Needed Improvement

 

By KEN McGRAW

It seems utterly inconsistent that
the University should sponser stu-
dent activities on the Friday night
of Springs and Openings and yet re-
quire class attendance on the follow-
ing day. The present two-faced ap-
pearance that the University has on
this matter is an apparent attempt
to be both liberal and strict at the
same thing. On the one hand is the
smiling face which condones all the
desires of a young man’s fancy and
on the other is the stoical and staid
face that we associate with the man
who wrote the Blue Laws. The Uni-
versity should say either “no”

It is apparent from the results of
yesterday's Student Body elections
that at least a partial revolution is
taking place at Washington and Lee
in the areas of student politics and
government. This revolution was
most apparent in the election of Fred
Mindel to the office of President of
the Student Body.

The Revolution to which I allude
is two-fold in nature. First, the stu-

We tread lightly here for fear}

a matter which should be left alone

a constructive role in student af-
fairs. Thus, the general repudiation
of the clique by the students will
probably enable the truly positive
and responsible individuals in the
party to rid itself of self-seeking
hangers-on.

The second aspect of this revo-
lution in student affairs is more
positive than the repudiation of old
political forms. This second factor
is the phenomena of a truly issue
oriented platform of the type pre-
sented by Fred Mindel. In support-
Mr. Mindel, the students have
made clear their desire to assume
a greater role in student govern-
ment and their desire to see their
representatives take a larger part
in the total life of the university,
The support of a platform includ-
ing such areas as curriculum, cut
system, Contact, fraternities, etc.
shows the interest of the students
in areas which have been left al-
most entirely to the discretion of
the administration and faculty or

Generals Lose Again

On 8th Inning Walks

By LOCK HANDLEY

W&L’s baseball team finally got
within hailing distance of a win
Tuesday. They led touring Castleton
State 9-5 going into the eighth. The
hitters had finally started hitting,
the fielders had been fielding suc-
cessfully, and starting pitcher Jim
Cooper had been generally effective
though somewhat wild.

Then things started to happen.

Cooper, who had used a total of
155 pitches in going seven, tired and
filled the bases with one run in and
nobody out. Coach Joe Lyles brought
in sinkerball Pete Heumann to try
for the double play, and Heumann,
who has yet to show the form he
displayed last year as a freshman,
gave up six more runs in retiring
two men. Southpaw Chris Wigert
was no more effective, walking both
men he faced, and freshman Bill
Rasmussen walked in another run
before getting the final out.

That was the thirteenth run for
Castleton; and that was the way it
wound up,

Except for that one disastrous in-
ning, however, the Generals looked
better than they had all year. They
scored runs in four different innings,
jumping off to a lead in the first
inning on a walk to Ashley Allen and
singles by Dave Kirkpatrick and Eric
Sisler, In the third, Tom Crenshaw’s
homer scored Allen, on base with
another walk. W&L added another
run in the same inning as Skip
Chase doubled, stole third, and came
home on Luke Crosland’s single.

In the fourth, a double by pitcher
Cooper and back-to-back singles by
Kirkpatrick, Allen, and Crenshaw
accounted for three more tallies. The
final General runs came in the sixth
on two Castleton errors and a single
by Crenshaw.

All told the team collected thir-
teen hits, one less than the visitors’
total. Crenshaw led W&L, going
three for four and driving in four
runs. Crosland also got three hits
for the Generals and Kirkpatrick
contributed two.

Coach Lyles was particularly en-
couraged by his squad’s base running,
which has been notably deficient in

Ah, beautiful spring again, that

Trackmen
Beat High
Point, 83-62

By JOHN GRAHAM

It’s a new season for the Washing-
ton and Lee track team.

The Generals, after dropping their
first two meets of the outdoor season,
defeated Hampden-Sydney last week
and High Point on Tuesday to even
the season ledger at 2-2.

Using a juggled lineup, the cinder-
men captured nine of 17 events,
sweeping the pole vault and the 880
to down High Point 83-62. The field
events proved to be the Generals’
strongest point, as they won four of
seven, taking second in the other
three.

Manson Wins

Dan Manson won the shot put with
a heave of 43'4”, Rick Mynttinen
took the javelin with a 165’8” throw,
Rich Hartgrove tied for first in the
high jump with a 5’8” leap, and John
Graham, John Lawrence and Rick
Rogers swept the pole vault.

The 440 yard relay team of Chris
Kell, Bob Bigham, Spencer Sulli-
van and Rob Orr led off the running
events, winning in :45.1. Kell won the
100 in :10.3, Bigham took the 440
in :52.0, and Sullivan captured the

last season to win the pennant in!
a six-team race. Defending champ-|
ion St. Louis, in spite of the poor |
start they have gotten off to, should
be able to take second.

Stickmen Face Cantoneville Next;

Swan Sees Tough, Even Game

Described as “a real tough team”
by coach Dana Swan, the Catons-
ville Lacrosse Club of Catonsville,
Maryland, will face the Washington
and Lee Generals in a game here
tomorrow.

Coach Swan sees W&L's chances
“as even” for the game set to begin
at 2 pam. at Wilson Field. The Mary-
land club is an experienced outfit
composed of players who in many
eases played their college career
at Maryland and Johns Hopkins.
They are reportedly leaded with
talent.

With their experience and talent
the Maryland club is the type of
team that can explode on a moment's
notice and turn a close contest into
a runaway. They seldom fail to take
advantages of their opponents mis-
takes.

Swarthmore, a one-goal conquerer
of the Generals in a practice game
earlier this season, holds a 14-9 de-

 

cision over Catonsville. However, this!

gether. Their midfield is also tough
with Towson’s former all-leaguer
Crispino helping to anchor this
position.

The Generals came out of their last
weekend's encounters with New
Hampshire and Hartwick in relative-
ly good shape. Several minor injuries
were incurred, but none serious
enough to prevent any players from
seeing action tomorrow. Billy An-
drews, who was knocked out against
New Hampshire in the most specta-
cular injury last week, returned for
practice Wednesday and will also be
ready for tomorrow's game.

This past week the Generals em-
phasized riding and clearing in prac-
tice, having apparently cleared up
some of their shooting difficulties
last week. W&L scored 19 goals in
the two games.

Coach Swan refused to make any
predictions on tomorrow's game, say-
in only that the Generals can win it
if they hustle, play soundly, keep

Honors As Golfers Tie

“It couldn't be much closer.” That's
what golf coach E. P. “Cy” Twombly
said after his team opened the sea-
son with a 4!2-4'2 tie match against
Hampden-Sydney’s Tigers.

Leading the way for the Generals
was captain Ed Crosland who was
medalist for the day with a 77. He
opened the meet with a 6-5 victory
over the Tiger’s Jim Councill. In the
other half of that foursome, Tom
Richardson took the measure of Bob
Duckwall, one-up. Duckwall card-
ed an 81, The Generals took the best
ball, 4-3.

In the second foursome, W&L’s
Dick Drew carded an 80 and was a
3-2 victor over Bill Beckner of
Hampden-Sydney. Jim Duke then
evened the series for the Tigers as
he downed Roger Sennott, one-up.
The best ball was halved.

Hampden-Sydney tied the match
on the third and final foursome. The
Tiger's Thompson was a 5-4 victor
over Dave Carroll. Jim Fulwider of
W&L countered with an 81 and a
3-2 victory over Bob Tuck. But
Hampden-Sydney took the best ball
one-up to tie the match at 44-44.

W&L this afternoon traveled
Ingleside golf club in Staunton for
a match with Bridgewater. On Mon-
day W&L will be at the Lexington
Golf Club for a match with Old Do-
minion. This could be a tough match
as coach Twombly rates ODC one
of the toughest golf teams in the
state.

by virtue of consistant hitting on the
part of fielders Dave Myers, Garry

baseman Scott Lavery.

Bouncing back on Wednesday, ZB |
dealt defeat to Sigma Chi 18-5 aided |
by pitcher Bruce Kramer and the|
heavy hitting of Mare Winston. The
Sigma Chi’s scored only in the first:
three innings and then were stopped |
while ZBT’s scored steadily through-
out the game. The Sigma Chi’s had
just come from a 26-12 thrashing at
the hands of the Phi Delts the Day
before.

League C was the scene of a pro-
test resulting from the Beta Theta
Pi game with the DU’s. The final
score was 12-11 in favor of the Beta’s,
however DU is protesting a call that
came in the last inning with two
men on base. DU runner Frank Jones
was called out for running the wrong
way after crossing first. The play
ended the ball game.

On Wednesday, Phi Ep was able
to edge the Betas 14-13 led by the
pitching of Maurice Fliess. Larry
