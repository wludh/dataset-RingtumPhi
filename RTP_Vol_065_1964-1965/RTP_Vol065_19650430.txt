THE RING-TUM PHI

Uninformed Electorate

With the dissolving of the University Party Tuesday night,

the campus political system has been thrown into a chaotic] (jj
state. In rejecting open primaries and nomination conven-|;

tions, the student body has opened itself wide to the danger
of an uninformed electorate and an over abundance of can-

didates.

The dissolving of the party is a step in the right direction;
the absence of an open primary is deplorable. In an effort
to inform the student body as to who is running, we have at-
tempted to gather a list of candidates. We hope to include
a statement from each of the EC candidates, but as of this
writing there are six candidates in the senior class, four in
the junior, and five in the sophomore.

On this page, you will find an article by Fred Mindel on
the qualities required of an EC member. The Ring-tum Phi
hopes this will enable the student body to vote critically and
intelligently. Optimistically, you, the voter, will know who’s

running.

A Salute To Our EC

During this year’s “Big Four” election, it seems that the
Executive Committee caught more than its deserved amount
of gas. The EC this year has entered more actively into real

student government and value

examinations than any recent

EC. Last spring, Jim Kulp, Jim DeYoung, and Malcolm
Mortis (this year’s officers) ran on a platform which they
have proved to be more than a list of “campaign promises.”
First, they have set up a Mock Honor Trial, scheduled
for next Wednesdy (Lee Chapel, 7:30) in order to better
inform the student body on the workings of the honor sys-
tem. This they proposed to do, in their first platform plank.
Second, they have supported the tradition of conventional
dress, but have examined the Assimilation Committee in order
possibly to implement the tradition.
Third, they did discuss the creation of freshman class of-

ficers and effected this change.

Fourth, they proposed monthly meetings of each class’s
officers. This fourth item on their platform was not, to our
knowledge, discussed, It was perhaps not worth consideration.

Fifth, the EC has proposed an agenda of each of its com-
ing meetings and has published the minutes of each EC meet-
ing, in keeping with their fifth plank.

Sixth, referendums have been taken to aid the EC in mak-
ing its decisions on controversial subjects. This was the es-
sence of the sixth platform plank advocating opinion polls.

Seventh, interviews have been held for EC-appointed com-
mittee applicants, and monthly policy statements have been re-

quired of the committee heads.

In six out of seven cases, this year’s EC has lived up to
their campaign proposals — an admirable record. In addition,
they have reapportionel EC representation and have tried to
change a deplorable political situation.

To an EC that has accomplished, has been progressive, has
been one of the best in past years, the Ring-tum Phi offers its
congratulations on a job well done.

 

By FRED MINDEL
EC President-elect

Everyone of us would probably
agree that an EC member should em-
body such general
qualities as hones-
ty, integrity, re-
sponsibility, leader-
ship, and initiative.
But what do such
words mean since
_ qualities are broad
and general yet
each of us defines
and looks for them
in accordance with
our own personal
values and experi-
ence? It is in light of this fact that
I delineate and make more specific
my definition of words such as “in-
tegrity or responsibility,” and what
qualities I personally believe a good
EC member must embody.

1.) Principles. Essential is a set of
principles in which a man_ believes
and to which he has committed him-
self, One of our professors defines a
great man as “one who is commit-
ted to or caught up in something
greater than himself,’ and this defi-
nition has stuck with me and become
incorporated into my scheme of val-
ues. I look for a man who is concerned
with, and dedicated to, principles and
ideals which transcend his own indi-
vidual ambition and status—and
which will result in a responsible
approach to each student's needs. A
fundamental love for W&L coupled
with a desire to keep it moving to-
wards becoming a great university
must be the end for its own sake,
rather than the means to some per-
sonal glorification.

Essential and primary in any scheme
of values and principles is an unyield-
ing. compassionate humanism. This
means dedication to, and concern for,
individual people. This goes beyond
standard conceptions of open-minded
ness, goes beyond obligations to fra-
ternity or coterie of friends, goes be-
yond the artificial restrictions of race,
creed, or color. It comes down to a
fundamental love and respect for the
student body at large, for people at
large, and only when this is true can
one speak to me of “open-mindedness”
or “integrity.”

2.) Idealism vs. Pragmatism. Also
essential is a personal balance between
idealism and practicality. The ideal
EC member should possess the in-
herent intellect and creativity neces-
sary to think in terms other than
merely our existing framework, to
dream and theorize, to cling to these
“ideals” rather than give them up be-
cause “hey’ll never work here.” Yet
this basic idealism must be tempered
by sound judgment and awareness as
to what would be feasible—to what
would be useful. I am talking about
a frame of mind, an attitude—about a
sensibility that dares to experiment

Four Enter Junior EC Race

 

Follo, Grant, Jeffress, Luck

Follo’s Statement

Briefly, my platform consists of
maintaining the Honer System as it
new stands. Such a standpoint must
not be defended by evoking tradition
or names from the past — just be-
eause the Honor System is old does
net mean it should be continued.
But on the other hand, just because
the Honer System is old does not
mean it should be changed either.
We must not create a mere illusion
of pregress through change; nor
should we be lulled inte a feeling of
stability by maintaining the status
quo. Rather, we musi be sensitive
but sensible in our approach to a
modification of the Honor System.

Grant's Statement

As a candidate for the position of
Executive Committeeman of the
Junior Class I would like to take this
opportunity to state my reasons and
qualifications for running for this
alfice.

I believe the position of Executive
Committeeman to be extremely im-
portant to all the members of our
class, for not only is he our repre-
sentative to the student judicial and
legislative bedy, but it is through
him that the class ean make known
its opinions and feelings as he rep-
resents these opinions on the Exe-
cutive Commitiee. As Executive
Committeeman, I would feel my ma-
jor responsibility to be that of active
and accurate representation in pre-
senting the views and opinions of
my class to the Executive Commit-
tee.

The Executive Committee is the
enly government the student bedy has.
This fact makes it doubly important
that the EC truly represent student
opinion.

My qualifications for this position
are printed on my

certain or safe), that dares to take a
stand and make a committment by
clinging to principles and convic-
tions at all costs, that dares to “live
in the present in light of the past,
with an ideal to the future,” (as that
same professor emphasizes), and that
dares to actually “lead” and expose
himself to the risks involved when-
ever one who is committed to an at-
titude or program tries to carry these
into action rather than merely over-
see or ride the gravy train.

3.) Humility. Essential to any EC
member, or person for that matter,
is a fundamental sense of humility.
An acute and penetrating self-honesty
is required here, to look inside and

 

means the outcome is not assuredly take stock of himself, to admit per-

sonal faults and flaws, to be able to
laugh at, and criticise himself, and
to be existentially aware and perpet-
ually conscious of the fact that an EC
member is exactly the same as any
other student in that he is at all times
a person, an individual who is no
more perfect than any other. This
humility has no room for supercilious-
ness, haughtiness, snobbery—it has
no room for anything but each indi-
vidual taken as just that.

4.) Authenticity. Essential to an EC
member (and it probably sounds trite)
is that he be a real person. There is
no room on the EC for one whose
ultimate “telos” is playing a role,
seeking status, or living within an

 

image. These are not “real people.”
The only thing I can ever ask for in
a person is that he be himself, and in
regard to potential EC members, it is
essential that each student be as he
has been throughout our stay at W&L.
It is one thing to cling to beliefs, to
present an attitude and program in
a campaign, yet still another and far-
removed thing to live this attitude and
program, and crucially, to have lived,
embodied and expressed it before this
eleciton week. Many of the EC candi-
dates say basically the same thing,
claim basically the same attitude.
The paramount distinction thus
emerges between those who say
how they will live and those who
live and have lived as they say.

 

Frazier, Griffin, Hash, Humphries, Lee, Moore, Ruffin

 

Frazier’s Statement

It seems to me that the two main
issues in any E.C. election must be
the honor system and representation,
A change has been suggested in the
Honor System that supposedly
would strengthen it. I don’t think
we should ever stop examining and
trying to improve the Honor Sys-
term, but a one year suspension or
graduated punishment for honor vio-
lations would not be an improve-
ment. Instead, I believe it would
greatly weaken the Honor System.
Changing the negative enforcement
of the system is not what is needed.
The thing I'l remember about the
Honor System is not how many peo-
ple got kicked out on honor viola-
tions but the time my Freshman
year when a professor gave me a
quiz to take back to my room and
take when I was ready.

Trust can be a lot more power-
ful enforcement than punishment.
Therefore, I would like to see us
have an exam period like the one at
Randolph - Macon in which two
weeks are set aside for exams and
each student takes his exams when
‘he wants. He arranges with his
professor when he'll turn it in, but
aside from that he can take it when
he wants. This would also elimi-
nate bad exam schedules.

As for representation I think a
monthly meeting of the IFC with the

Independents would help the EC to
better know and represent student
opinion.

I would like to see these improve-
ments made and to seriously and
responsibly represent you — the
Senior Class.

 

Griffin’s Statement

As a candidate for executive com-
mitteeman from the senior class, I
would like to stress that 1 stand for

 

Seek Junior E C Positions

Jeffress’s Statement

My candidacy for the position of
Junior Class Executive Committee-
man rests on the belief chat my qual-
ifieations, ability, and viewpoints on
the major issues of the campaign
will enable me to represent the ma-
jority views of the members of the
class in an active, aggressive way
which ean translate these views into
action. The qualifications J leave to
the campaign posters; here I wish
only to make my position clear on
issues in four areas:

1) Wholehearted support of the
Honor System as it now stands. Al-
though that the sysiem is not a
utopian solution to the problem it
attacks, I believe that all proposals of
change advanced thus far would alter
the very basis of the system in such
a way that its acknowledged effec-
tiveness would be reduced signifi-
eantly.

2.) Washington and Lee has aban-

 

tions permanently, and should not
to it. 1 believe, however,
‘that the E.C. should take positive
steps to bring about a workable,

| pepularly acceptable nominating sys-
and
‘elarity out of the present confusing,’
most important thing in my mind)
is that I get around te each member |
of the class in some manner to make)

ithe basis of the past should consider

tem which will bring order

3.) The present enforcement of

Luck’s Statement

The Executive Committee has neg-
leeted a responsibility it holds im-
plicitly as a representative body.
Except for a few notable exceptions
the men on the EC. have failed to
take any decisive action on several
issues of major importance to this
student body — issues which de-
mand solution, such as the conven-
tional dress and assimilation com-
mittee problems, and the problem of
instituting a suitable political system.

I seek an end to this theory of
status quo in student leadership and
student government. It is time for
the Executive Committee to make a
truly concentrated effort to discov-
er the prevailing student opinion
concerning these issues and to make
at last a concentrated effort to act
on these issues. Anything less is
shirking responsibility. To facilitate
the settlement of these issues and
ifuture ones, I propose the extensive
'use of measures such as class polls
and general referendums.

The recent statement by the EC
concerning its stand on the eul sys-
tem is commendable in that it gave
eredance and authority te student
protest. I favor the EC taking more
stands of this nature in similar is-
sues of concern to both the students
and the faculty. By doing so the
Executive Committete can regain its
role as the official spokesman of this
student body in university matters,
and ean again represent the com-
bined voice of the students

In the coming days I will be seeing,

Seven To Vie For Senior EC Positions

neither liberal reform nor dogmatic, judgment and personal objectivity at

conservatism. My every effort will
be directed toward the maintenance
of an open mind.

I have prepared a three-point pro-
gram which I submit for the con-
sideration of the rising senior class.
1.) A complete evaluation and as-
sessment of the present committee
system. 2.) The membership of a
student-at-large on executive com-
mittees. 3.) Maintenance of the pres-
ent status of the honor system.

While I emphatically disagree with
change for the sake of change, or
change in the case where it is not
for the betterment of our school, I
would hope to be the first to recog-
nize and endorse a feasible plan or
idea which directs itself toward posi-
tive objectives and a better learn-
ing environment. These very ideas and
plans are the essence of progressive
change—neither “liberal” nor con-
servative” —progressive.

 

Hash’s Statement

My decision to seek the office of
Senior Class Executive Committee-
man is based on my firm conviction
that the E.C. can and, indeed, must
take a vigorous lead in the conduct
of student government at Washing-
ton and Lee. It is certainly not
enough to be willing to serve, for
many of us possess this desire, but

: ‘it is essential that any candidate for
EC with representatives from the

this position be prepared to dare, to
risk, and even more important, to
think.

The demands which are placed
upon a member of the E.C. are, to
say the least, extensive. I have had
the unique and valuable experience
of attending almost every E.C. meet-
ing this year in my capacity as man-
aging editor of the Ring-tum Phi. I
have observed at first hand the dis-
cussions and deliberations of the E.
C., and I have become increasingly
aware of the potential for construc-
tive action which this body has at
its disposal.

With respect to my position on the
Honor System, I wish to state my
unequivocal support for this insti-
tution as it is presently constituted.
This is not to preclude careful and
reasoned examination of the system
in an effort to render it more effee-
five and beneficial. In reference to
various alternative penalties for

Honor System violations. I should
like to say that I cannot in good’
conseience endorse any of the re-

cently proposed plans. Once again,
I feel that the Honor System as it
stands is not above critical and
searching evaluation if only te
strengthen this tradition which has
so long endured.

In the conduct of the legislative
funetions of the E.C., it is important
that the E.C. be attuned to student
bedy opinions, but these opinions
must be regarded as guidelines
rather than mandates. This is an
area in which the E.C. must take
the lead by stimulating interest and
participation in the often neglected
opportunities available in our uni-
versity community. Student apathy
ean only be cured by a concerted
and econsisient program of the E.C.
which seeks to involve students and
faculty in the total experience of
Washington and Lee.

There are a number of problems
on this campus with which next
years Executive Commitiee must
coneern itself. These difficulties are
obvious to all of us, and in addition,
they have been discussed in the re-
eent student bedy elections. The cut
system, the political dilemma, and
conventional dress are several areas
which require the immediate and
eareful attention of the E.C.

It is my intention to represent the
senior class on the E.C. in a manner
eonsistent with those principles

promise that I shall treat every issue
with all the resources of sound

 

 

my disposal.

 

Humphries’s Statement

Fellow Classmates:

I want to do it — it isn’t a mat-
ter of prestige or position, but rath-
er a mattter of who will represent
you on the Executive Committee and
what he will do for you and for the
University.

I am of the opinion that one
should always willingly advocate
change if improvement is necessary,
but if something works well and
can not be strengthened, then change
is not a necessity in itself.

I advocate the honor system in all
its ramifications beeause it works,
and works well. I do feel, however,
that it should be extended by the
Administration to the library so that
the stacks could be open from 8:15
a.m. to 12:00 noon inclusive.

I advocate conventional dress, for
it is a characteristic that makes this
University different from the sweat-
shirted masses of other colleges and
universities. Without it Washington
and Lee would not seem to be Wash-
ington and Lee.

I feel that certain changes could
be made in the Student Control
Committee, having served on it. For
example, I feel that “drunk while
driving” eases should be left entirely
to our courts of law, especially
since enly Lexington cases come be-
fore the Committee. Besides trying
the individual twice, it seems ,in-
equitable that Lynchburg, ane
or Buena Vista cases do not reach
the Committee.

The cut system should be liberal-
ized, in that on a campus on which
the individual may drink, may own
automobiles in his sophomore year,
and may rent apartments rather than
living in dormitories, it seems to be
an anachronism that the individual
is led by the hand to class.

I feel that I am qualified to rep-
resent you. I want to represent you
— yours is the decision — it is as
you will.

 

Lee’s Statement

We often tend to question why the
more important traditions at Wash-
ington and Lee work. The more
skeptical among us insist that con-
ventional dress works, not because
the student bedy considers it a
worthy tradition, but because the
Assimilation Committee exists to
feree compliance to the letter of the
conventional dress code. These erit-
ies also suggest that the Honor Sys-
tem is an effective one, not because
Washington and Lee students are
basically honorable men, but because
they are “cowered” into honesty by
the fear of expulsion; that, in fact,
any alteration of the absolute rem-
edy would precipitate a rash of hon-
or violations. And it has been these
same people who have urged the re-
tention of a fraternity-based politi-
eal system because the siudent bedy
was incapable of nominating its own
eandidates. This last myth, perhaps
the most eynical and ludicrous of
them all, has recently been preven
patently absurd.

Ironically, it has been these same
people who have centended that
Washington and Lee is a somewhat
“ideal” community: that the very
size and homogeniety of the student
bedy eontributes te the effective ex-
ercise of these traditions. I also be-
lieve that Washington and Lee is an
unique academic community. But if
it is “ideal,” why cannot we adopt a
more idealistic approach to our tra-
ditiens: why must we eontinue to
think in terms ef absolute penal-
ties? Cannot we experiment with
eonventional dress to determine
whether or not it ean be satiafae-
iorily maintained withoul an assimi-

a string of victories as the Washing-

ton and Lee track team finished its.
'|dual meet season Wednesday.

The Generals mashed the North
Carolina school 90-55 to conclude a
5-2 record. All of the victories fol-
lowed spring vacation.

Winning 11 events to the visitors’
six, the Generals were never seri-
ously threatened. Once again, an al-

| tered lineup was used to hold down

the score. Bill Wildrick, Brad Shin-
kle and Moulton Dowler swept the
mile. Freshman Luke Meadors won
both the long jump and the triple
jump.

John Graham won the pole vault,
followed by Gary Wilkinson, as Dan
Manson, Ted Larson and Rich Hart-
grove took seconds in the shot put,
discus and high jump respectively.
Jeff Kugel was third in the javelin.

Sprinter Chris Kell won the 440
yard dash in :51.6, followed by Spen-

 

| Bill Miller took the top two places
Elon College provided the fifth in

in the 120 high hurdles, Kugel win-
ning in 17.1. They reversed positions
in the 330 intermediate hurdles, with
Miller winning in 42.9.

George Parker won the 880 in 2:-
08.2 and Andy Kilpatrick took third.
Quarter miler Bob Bigham won the
20 in 23.1 as John Wiley placed third.
Lee Johnson won the two mile in
10:18.8 as Riff O'Connor took sec-
ond. The Generals also won the 440
relay in 44.5,

The mile relay proved an Elon
victory as the “official” W&L team
composed of pole vaulters finished
behind the vistors and three “unof-
ficial” General teams. In the spec-
ial 440 weightmen’s relay, Elon
barely nudged out the fleet-footed
Generals.

Nash’s Statement

I am glad to have been given this
opoprtunity te express to you my
position as a candidate for Sepho-
more Representative to the Executive
Committee. Experience is a quality
which is needed to perform any job
well, And serving on the Executive
Committee of Washington and Lee
University is no exception. In view
of the experience I have gained dur-
ing this year, I sincerely believe that
I am well qualified to help lead this
school forward; to make a great uni-
versity even greater.

There are many things, large and
small, eoncerning Washington and
Lee which need a course of action.
Why can’t we push hard fer unlimit-
ed cuts for the upper three classes?
Why can’t we supply the Student
Union with a decent television set,
a juke box for dances, ping-pong
tables, and other recreational facili-
ties? Definite steps must be made
one way or another concerning con-

ventional dress and the Assimilation)
Committee. Why can't ways be found

for lifting Washington and Lee’s
school spirit and supporting our
athletic teams? Why can't something
be done about having the stacks in
the library open during dinner
hours? If I am elected, 1 will be
one of two, or possibly three mem-
bers of the Executive Committee re-
turning from this year. With my
year of what might be ealled “sen-
jority”, I will be able to lead the
fight for all of these things and
consequently make Washington and
Lee closer to being not just one of
the best, but the best.

However, the Executive Commit-
tee has a function other than that of
debating and voting on reforms and

petitions. This function is its most
important that of conducting hon-
or trials.

You must remember that

 

 

 

 

night will sit, listen, weigh the facts,
and come to a decision concerning
each student accused of an honor
violation. The Executive Committee
next year is going to need members
who have experience in conducting
honor trials, experience in weighing
facets, and experience in making de-
cisions. The Committee needs men
who are composed, f[ ree-thinking,
and of sound judgment.

The selection of representatives to
the Executive Committee is not one
to be taken lightly. I am convinced
that you want to get Washington and
Lee moving in a forward direction.
And with the experience that I have
obtained, I feel confident that I can
lead us forward.

I would like to thank you very
much for your support.

Smith’s Statement

As your Executive Committeeman,
I will be in constant communication
with you so that I will be able to
accurately and effectively represent
class opinion. I will poll the entire
class a minimum of three times dur-
ing the school year (Sept., Dec., and
March) to learn your views on cam-
pus questions. This polling will en-
able me to orient my actions and to
take the exact position which the
class as a whole favors on a particu-
lar matter. You, in turn, will be
regularly informed as to what I am
doing by reports or columns in the
Ring-tum Phi. Your suggestions will
be welcomed at all times and will be
considered with an open mind.

I will devote to this office the
time and energy which it demands
and meet the responsibilties which
accompany it. As your Executive
mittee, I will be a field officer rather
than a desk officer.

B. Adherence to conventional dress

C. Removal of the existing cut

D. Revision of the existing cut

Head’s Statement

I believe in the basie principles of
the honor system as it now stands,
and I believe that I am qualified to
help uphold those traditions that
have made the system what it is to-
day. I favor the movement to revise
the cut system and its penalties.
And if elected I will strive to see
that there is more participation by
the student body and our class in
particular in the affairs of our stu-
dent government.

 

I am earnestly interested in serv-

 

and ability, and if selected I will try
to keep its interests at heart.

 

 

Winn’s Statement

As a candidate for one of the
Sophomore positions on the Execu-
tive Committee, I feel it is essential
that my classmates understand my
reasons for seeking office—that is,
what I hope to represent and what
I intend to accomplish. I am sincere
in my interest in Washington and
Lee and am asking for recognition
in a leadership capacity so that by
working through the students I may
earnestly endeavor to make worth-

while contributions and improve-
ments where there as an evident
need.

I want to serve in an office where
I can legislate in behalf of the stu-|
dents, and I would always be anx-,
ious to discuss or look into any as-
pect of W&L which might merit
revision or strengthening. One of
the most distressing deficiencies at
this university is the lack of school
spirit; 1 would like to see a renewal
of enthusiasm in attendance of ath-

Stickmen Lees To Hofstra, 17-11;

Klingelhofer Paces W&L Attack

Washington and Lee’s lacrosse
team lost its second game in a row
Wednesday afternoon as the local
stickmen were defeated by Hofstra
17-11 in a game that had been post-
poned from earlier this season.

W&L got off to a bad start in the
contest, trailing 5-0 before the first
General goal. Early in the second
quarter W&L tied the match at five
apiece but the New York school
added four more goals before the
half ended to pick up a 9-5 lead.

The third quarter was bad for
W&L. Hofstra got three quick goals
at the start of the period and added
three more before the period ended
while the Generals were scoreless.
W&L made a comeback in the final
period, outscoring Hofstra by a 6-2
margin, but it was the old story of
too little, too late.

In Hofstra, Washington and Lee
was facing a big, tough, fast team
featuring one of the top scorers in
the east, Sam Mordetti. He was aver-
aging three goals and four assists
per game. W&L’s Bendann held him

to just two goals and one assist, but
the Generals didn’t hold Jim Griffith.
Carroll Klingelhofer led W&L with
three goals and three assists, bring-
ing his season totals to 21 goals and
20 assists. Also coming in for praise
from Coach Dana Swan was Bob
Frost “who played his best game of
the year in many respects.” Frost
scored one goal and played a real
tough game defensively.

The Generals next see action to-
morrow when they travel to Chester-
ton, Maryland, to face a highly-rated
Washington College squad.

The Generals are in pretty good
shape for the game with no injrries
having been reported. Coach Swan
said, “We can beat Washington but
it's going to take a heck of a lot
of doing.” He pointed to their speed
as the biggest problem facing the
Generals.

After Saturday's encounter with
Washington the Generals will travel
to Towson for a game against Towson
College. Little is known about their
team this year.

lation committee? Can we not at-
tempt to determine whether or not
the absolute penalty is indispensible
to the effective exercise of the Hon-
or System? Can't we attempt to
reconcile our Honor System with
prevailing concepts of justice with-
out weekening it? Can't we at least
experiment with these traditions, and
if we are proved wrong, then we
shall have merely proven the skep-
ties among us right. But is it not
possible that these things can be ac-
complished, and if they can, is it
not our responsibility to experiment
with them?

During the recent school elections
we heard much about “active repre-
sentation.’ The candidate who coined
this expression was given an over-
whelming mandate from the student
body. Now it is out obligation to
insure that Fred Mindel will not be
hamstrung by an
Executive Committee. It is our re-
sponsibility to elect to membership
on the Executive Committee those
candidates who have consistently
expressed similar sentiments.

Moore’s Statement

I have no startling new platform

a “status-quo” man. In order to be
effective, an honor system must be
strong and to a certain extent un-

1c.

unsympathetic

 

I am also for the continued and

increased use of both the E.C. and!

the ODK Forum, as a joint effort,
in presenting to the faculty recom-
mendations for changes and reform.
The faculty will listen to what we
have to say if it is sound enough as
representative of the student body.
Besides the cut system, which cer-
tainly needs overhauling, and the
possibility of no classes on Saturday
(a possibility which becomes more
and more a reality the more we raise
our voices), there should be consid-
eration of a change in the schedul-
ing of exams. If we have a true
honor system which is respected by

the faculty as well as the students}

shouldn’t we be allowed to
when we want to take an
exam? Because our honor system
works, the professor would have
only one exam to make out, and it
could be arranged so that the pro-
fessor would get the papers in time
to grade them. Exam grades have
become too important to have to
suffer because one has a number of
exams very close together.

Ruffin’s Statement

There are seven candidates for the
two Senior E.C, positions. I seek
this position because I find that five
of them represent an approach to
student government which I do not
share.

When Fred Mindel was elected
President of next year’s E.C., a wave
of instant progressivism swept the
campus. This new outlook is reflect-
ed in the programs of my opponents.
With minor exceptions, I am in ac-
cord with the statements of my op-
ponents; who wouldn’t be? All call
for a more active E.C. which will
take the initiative in those areas it
has too long ignored.

 

between me and
that I called for
jexpanded E.C. activity before Fred
Mindel won, and they have chosen
to climb onto the band wagon after
these programs have proved their
appeal to the student body. With
the exception of Bob Lee, my op-
ponents have recently acquired a
dubious, new-found progressivism.

As a member of Fred Mindel’s
campaign staff, I participated in the
development of the program for
“active representation.” The essence
of this program is that the Washing-
ton and Lee Student Body, through
its student government, must assume
a greater role in all aspects of the
University: academic, social and cul-
tural. My opponents have typically
been identified with the status quo.

Freshman EC Candidate Winn’s Statement

(Continued from page 3)

pointing support received this year—
perhaps “pep rallies” would revive
a spirit which seems to have left
W&L years ago!

It certainly is regrettable that the
other class officers aren't delegated
more responsibility, and I would
hope to see these leaders working
together with the E.C. members
to obtain a diversity of student opin-
ion. I have been confronted with
these an dmany other valid innova-
tions which I am eager to see acti-
vated.

It is one thing for them to espouse
the policies which won the most re-
cent election, but do they really be-
lieve them?

If next year’s E.C. is to be able
to expand its activity and play a
more vital role in initiating im-
provements at Washington and Lee,
its members must seriously be in-
terested in these positive goals. If
elected, it is in this new spirit that
I will serve.

W&L has a great deal to offer
to any individual, and I am sure that
my four years here will be memor-
able and advantageous, but I hope
to accomplish much more than ob-
taining an education if given the op-
portunity. I cannot overemphasize
the importance of judging the vari-
ous candidates on the basis of their
qualifications and leadership poten-
tial; I know that I can do the best
job and would appreciate the sup-
port of all those who realize the
need for effective leadership in place
of the static policies of the past.
