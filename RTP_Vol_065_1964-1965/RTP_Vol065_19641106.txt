Attention Turns To Tigers Tomorrow

 

Trustees Meet
To Consider
Alumni House

The Washington and Lee Alumni
Association Board of Trustees will
meet today to review a _ proposal
for the renovation of the home of the
late Dr. Fitzgerald Flournoy into an
alumni house. At the time the board
will inspect detailed plans which
have been submitted by a prominent
Lynchburg architectural firm. In the
event that these plans are approved,
the next step would be for the
Alumni Board to receive bids from
interested construction firms.

In en interview, however, Mr. W.
C. Ashburn, Executive Secretary of
the Alumni Association, stated thai

 

nothing definite could be announced
concerning the future prospects o/
an alumni house until the Board
has reached a decision. He further
stated that it is entirely possible that
the proposed alterations will be con-
sidered impractical and that the
erection of an entirely new structure
might prove more feasible.

Mr. Washburn was emphatic in
stressing the need for an alumni
house, for at present, the University
does not have facilities for accom-
modating its alumni during such
events as class reunions and home-
comings. Currently the Commons
must accommodate the social func-
tions accompanying these events—
an arrangment with obvious dis-
advantages. In addition to fulfilling
alumni needs ,the proposed house
would also be used for faculty social
functions.

Executive Committee Acts On Student Petition:
Assimilation Committee Referendum To Be Held

Last Wednesday night, the Execu-
tive Committee set in motion a pro-
cess to bring the existence and
powers of the Assimilation Commit-
tee before a student referendum.
The Executive Committe’s action fol-
lowed the receipt of a student pe-
tition requesting such a referendum.

These students believe that un-
enforced conventional dress could
exist at W&L in light of similar
conditions at University of Virginia.

The text of the petition, delivered
to the EC. earlier this week is
as follows:

“We the undersigned do hereby
petition and request the Execu-
tive Committee of the Student
Body of Washington and Lee to
eonduct before Christmas Vacation
a referendum on whether or not
the student government will con-
tinue to enforce conventional dress.
The referendum must further pro-
vide a mechanism to determine
what items of clothing will be
embraced by the term “conven-
tional dress.” should enforced con-

Specifically, this mechanism must

“The undersigned do not neces-

A spokesman for the petitioning

is simply a request for a definite

Activities Begin Tonight
In Red Square at 7 p.m.

By MIKE DUNN
A parade and pep rally combine with a football contest
with unbeaten Sewanee to head the list of this weekend’s ac-
tivities as W&L alumni return to Lexington for the annual

Homecoming Weekend.

Starting from Red Square at 7 o'clock tonight, a student

parade will follow a fire engine

ington Street to Doremus Gymna-*——

sium for the pep rally. This tradition,
of the Pajama Parade will be re-'
stored as freshmen parade through
the town.

M.C. Randy Jones and Sem cheer-
leaders will conduct the rally fol-
lowed by the presentation of the
fraternity Homecoming representa-
tives. The Minx Jazz quartet will
provide the music.

Varsity Club president Butch West
has announced that the club ic offer-
ing a prize of $10 to the best sign
in the parade or at the rally.

From 3 to 7 o'clock this afternoon
a committee of from eight to ten
faculty members, alumni, and resi-
dents of Lexington judged the
Homecomings displays built by the
fraternities during the past week.

 

and fourth place trophies on the
basis of originality, thought, effort,
and appropriateness of the theme.

Visiting alumni will register to-
morrow from 9 to 12 a.m. in Wash-
ington Hall. Tours of the campus will
also run during these hours.

From 10 to 12 am. alumni and.
their guests may attend a coffee and
open house at the home of Presi-
dent Cole, followed by a luncheon
at Evans Dining Hall. Interested
alumni are also invited to fraternity
open houses from 8 until 12 p.m.

The highlight of the weekend,
however, is tomorrow's game at 2
p.m. when the Generals meet the
Sewanee Purple Tigers in what
should be a fast-moving, hard-
fought game. Sewanee’s 6-0 record
has given it the top spot in the
College Athletic Conference. Half-
time ceremonies will include a pres-
entation of the Homecoming repre-
sentative and the selection of the
Queen.

 

Nineteen candidates, one repre-

up Jefferson Street and Wash-
resenting each fraternity and the
Independent Union, will vie for the
honor of being Washington and Lee’s
Homecoming Queen for 1964.

Larry Meeks, SPE, coordinator of
the event, announced that the can-
didates will be presented this eve-
ning at the pep rally in Doremus
Gymnasium.

The judging committee, led by Dr.
James K. Shillington, will select a
Queen this evening but will keep
their decision secret until the formal
coronation tomorrow. Dr. Shilling-
ton will personally crown the win-
ner.

In a major change from previous
policy, a first and a second runner-
up will be selected and crowned
during the half along with the
Queen. Meeks expressed optmism
about the selection of the runners-
up and added, “we hope to revive
some of the spirit that was missing
from last year’s festivities.

Queen candidates will be present-
ed immediately after the 7:15 pm.
pep rally in the Gym. They will
then be escorted to the Student
Union where Dr. Shillington’s com-
mittee will select a Queen and the
two runners-up. All candidates will
be presented at the football game,
and during the half, the Queen and
runners-up will be formally crown-
ed..

Shortened Classes

In response to student body
president Jim Kulp’s petition, the
faculty has agreed to shorten to-
morrow's class schedule so that
“S° hour will end at 12:10 rather
than at 1:00. The faculiy stressed
that this was being done so that
all students would be able to get
into the stadium before the kick-
off and avoid late arrivals,

An Opportunity for Education

Washington and Lee has entered the
twentieth century.

Narrow-minded,  segregationalist views
which persisted in the 1870’s have been dis-
carded to make way for the inevitable realities
of the 1960’s which should have been the
realities of the 1890's, if indeed they should
have been maintained that long. The clarifica-
tion on admissions recently released by the
Board of Trustees (for it is a clarification of
statement and not a radical departure from
previous policy) frees W&L from the attribu-
tion of prejudice at a time when the rest of
the South and the nation as a whole are be-
coming cognizant of the fact that Negroes
are human beings, and are realizing that their
racial policies have been bigoted and unreal-
istic. The lowering of racial barriers at prac-
tically every superior educational institution in
the South as well as elsewhere, including
neighboring girls’ schools, is just another in a
long line of witnesses to this fact.

There is no reason for W&L to maintain
its traditional status quo which has recently
placed the school merely on the brink of great-
ness. A university’s success or failure depends
in large part upon the extent to which it allows
the student to meet new and challenging
ideas, even if they may seem to be impala-
table at first glance.

Perhaps it is because many of us have not
had the opportunity of genuine association
with Negroes of a superior calibre in the past
that we condemn the whole of the race as un-
able to contribute to the broadening of our
horizons. There is a need for association with
Negroes at this school in the same way that
students need to be confronted with untried
ideas in order that they may test the validity of
the opinions which they hold. The success of
a student’s own education depends on the
extent to which he is willing to take up the
challenge of examining both sides of a ques-
tion and to expose himself to “the other side.”

If there is no exposure to the other
side, there can be no opportunity for growth
in the minds of the students and active
inquiry succumbs to the sterile stability.
We cannot ignore the problem of integra-
tion; it will not go away; we can only enter
the twentieth century and accept the realis-
tic attitude of confronting it. No concept
can be tested without examination; we now

 

A One-Party § ystem?

The voters in the election of 1964 have
given a decisive answer to the crucial question
of the campaign. To the question, “Should
the federal government continue to play a
large part in questions concerning industry,
labor, economics, and private living benefits,
in preference to a restroation of individual
freedoms and liberties?, the American elect-
orate has answered, “Yes!", in an overwhelm.
ing majority,

It is our fear that Lyndon Johnson will
consider this overwhelming evidence of the
voters’ confidence in him as a mandate to in-
crease the role of federal intervention to a
staggering domination, and hence a decrease
in individual rights and liberties. It is our fear
that the ill effects of this socialistic advance
(or classify it as you will) will accompany
the good, and perhaps even outweigh the
good, effects.

We are glad that Johnson won. We will
be sad to see our fears become actualities, if
the President infers that the American public
desires that no restraint be put on the fed.
eral government. We are sorry to see Mr.
Johnson sweep the election by an unprece-
dented majority; we fear that he will infer
too much from this, It is our hope that the
President will see his victory not as a mandate
tor increasing sO ialistic programs but as a
mandate for strong leadership.

We are, on the other hand, not sorry that
a conservative, as strong a conservative as Bar-
ry Goldwater, ran against President Johnson.
The effect of Mr. Goldwater's candidacy has
been to moderate the views of President John.

have the opportunity to test our concepts.

Validity is an impossibility if we are pre-

sented with only one choice to consider.

Can we say our education is complete

if we are not courageous enough to submit
our beliefs to an open-minded examination?
Do we have the courage to submit our beliefs
to scrutiny? Are any beliefs which do not stand
up in an investigation worth holding? Or, are
we afraid that we shall find these comfortable
and traditional beliefs and attitudes out-moded
and the remnants of a past era?

We now have the opportunity to ex-
amine our attitudes. We can now gain a full
modern education at Washington and Lee.
The world outside of the Shenandoah val-
valley is coming to the realization that its
population is made not only of whites, but
also of Negroes, of Chinese, and of other
peoples of various races and creeds. Wash-
ington and Lee has fled its provincialism;
it is willing to enter the outside world. But,
are we, the students, willing to grow with
it? Are we willing to enter the twentieth
century?

The policies of the Admissions Commit-
tee will apply equally to members of all races;
no Negro is going to be granted admission
simply because he is a Negro. He must meet
the high standards that have been met by all
of us who are now students of this University.
No one will be forced to accept an inferior
student, simply because he is a Nego, as a
fellow member of the W&L student body.
Futhermore, there will be no effort on the
part of the Admissions Staff to search out a
qualified Negro to apply for, or accept, ad-
mitance into the Washington and Lee stu-|
dent body.

Although Washington and Lee is a private
institution, we have no right to force students
to conform with accepted and untried tradi-

tions. We now have the opportunity to test|/

our traditions and our attitudes. In a way, we
are a test case. Are we willing to linger on the
brink of greatness through the maintenance of
antiquated attitudes? Or, are we willing to
pioneer the way in twentieth century edu-

cation?

The quesion is no longer whether or
not to integrate, but what is the best meth-
od of integration.

son in a way that was vitally needed. The fact
that a conservative led the Republican Party
certainly reveals that the nation as a whole

is not ready to submit to a Washington-con-
trolled United States.

We are sorry that Goldwater was beaten
by such a sizeable majority, because of the
unbalance this has created in the two-party
system. The apathy created among some Re-
publicans by the fact of Goldwater's candidacy
caused them to stay away from the polls, It
contributed to such men as Keating, Percy,
and Taft's losing their respective campaigns.
That these fine leaders would have stood a
better chance of election if they had run un-
der the leadership of a stronger candidate
goes without saying. That they were not elect.
ed is a crime, a crime committed not only
against them, but also against the American

public.

The equilibrium which a two-party sys-
tem has given the United States has certainly
contributed to the effective government which
this country has had in the past. With the
waning GOP, this balance has been disrupted
and the country has now become a one-party
country in a way that has seldom occurred in
the past.

President Johnson has been issued an au
thority and given a mandate that is clear and
unmistakable, It will be considered, hopefully,
a mandate to follow a national consensus in
domestic and foreign policy. It will, hopefully,
continue to be used with the same restraint
and common sense that Lyndon Baines John

tarily supported by a society. Brooks
Brown’s admission about who does
the assimilating at W&L is striking
because it indicates that the very
people who should be supporting
this “tradition” (i.e, the ordinary
students) are extremely apathetic
about it.

But so much for statistics. Actual
experience and observation indicate
that the average W&L student will
assimilate someone for only two
reasons—as a joke or as a means of
carrying on a petty vendetta with
another student. In fact, I would
go so far as to say that almost
no one ever assimilates another stu-
dent because he feels it his duty or
because he believes in conventional
dress as defined by the Assimilation
Committee. The exception to this
rule are the members of the Assim-
ilation Committee themselves, who
need assimilations to give some val-
ue to their jobs and who do usually
feel duty-bound to support their
concept of conventional dress. Hence,
2 per cent of the student body makes
50 per cent of the assimilations.

As a matter of fact, the Assimila-
tion Committee is actually held in
contempt by a significant proportion
of the W&L student body. In the
words of a letter recently received
by the Ring-tum Phi the Assimila-
tion Committee has come to repre-
sent legal buffoonery and petty try-
anny to a great many students.

Reasons for Decline

Why, one might wonder, has a
supposedly student-created institu-
tion like the Assimilation Com-
mittee reached such a low degree
of reputation and respect? The an-
swer is obvious—most students are
not sure that the Assimilation Com-
mittee and its notions of what makes
“conventional dress” are sanctioned
by the general will of the students.
No one at W&L can say authori-
tatively that the Assimilation Com-
mittee does not represent a sup-
pression of the majority’s wishes by
a very small minority. The Assimi-
lation Committee has ceased to be
a student-supported tradition and
has gradually assumed the posture
of dictatorial little cabal invested
with the power of financial punish-
ment,

mittee be saved from this dilemma of

Polly Adler

Polly Adler, one of New York's
foremost madams of the twenties
has come clean and written a book
about the trials and tribulations of
a madam which is a new twist in
the trend of sexual discussion in lit-
erature. Her complaint is that they
(whoever that is) can forgive a
thief, a prostitute or even a murder-
ess but not a procuress (a little
ironic),

Our unforgiveable procuress finds
her way to the screen in the form
of Shelly Winters, an unforgiveable
actress. We see Polly first as a young
maiden (Shelly isn't too convine-
ing here) who gets raped and starts
| off on a brilliant career as a madam
with help of bootlegging Robert
Taylor who bootlegs his part and
impresses no one but Caesar Ro-
mero, a political boss who likes his
style. Polly falls in love but must
reject her lover because no one can
forgive a madam

THE RING-TUM PHI

W &L, Sewanee Clash
In Homecoming Tilt

By JOHNNY GRAHAM

The single wing has disappeared from college football—

almost.

The Tigers of the University of the South are one of the

few teams in the country still

using this powerful offense,

and it will present a definite problem for Washington and Lee’s
Generals as the two teams meet tomorrow at 2 p.m. on Wil-

son Field.

Sewanee carries a 14-game win
streak into the contest. The Tigers
haven’t lost since dropping their

final game of the 1962 season. Last
year’s record of 8-0-0, including a
35-6 humbling of the Generals, was
good enough to bring them the
College Athletic Conference foot-
ball championship.

The single wing offense will put
tremendous pressure on the General
defensive forward wall. Middle
guard Charlie Myers, tackle Starke
Sydnor and Jack Kelley and ends
Tersh Baker and Bob Reading will
have their hands full trying to
handle the power packed offense.
Several changes in alignments have
been made to check the formation.

General coach Lee McLaughlin in-
dicated pleasure at the way his
charges moved the football in Satur-
urday’s 20-16 win over Bridge-
water.

“For the last two weeks we have
moved the ball well on the ground,”
he stated. “Last week we got out-
side for some long gains.”

Sewanee, however, has two good
defensive ends, and the best chance
for long gains seems to be knocking
the end out and cutting inside and
then to the sidelines.

General manpower will be great-
er than it has been in recent weeks.
Fullback John Anthony is the only
starter definitely out. He reinjured
his ankle the only time he carried
the ball on Saturday.

McLaughlin had praise for sev-
eral players following Saturday’s
victory. Tackles Starke Sydnor and
Logie Bullitt drew praise for their
defensive play with Sydnor also
lauded for playing “his best offeffn-
sive game.” Fullback Tommy Sparks
played an outstanding game both
on offense and defense and Dan
Manson, also a fullback, was impres-
ive on offense.

 

Bicnn

 

Johnson Leads

Tigers’ Attack

M. L. Agnew, the Mr. Everything
of the College Athletic Conference,
has graduated. One would think
things would be looking up. They
aren't.

Agnew played tailback last season
for Sewanee, Washington and Lee’s
homecoming opponent here tomor-
row. He ran for 835 yards, passed
for 507 yards (60.3 per cent com-
plete) and scored ten touchdowns.

Bill Johnson has arrived.

Last season, playing wingback
and tailback in Sewanee’s single
wing offense, Johnson was sort of
a potent non-entity. He carried 10
times for a 16.6 yard average but
didn’t throw any passes. He caught
10-tops on the team—while scoring
five touchdowns.

Now he plays talback and throws
as well as runs. He’s a 6-2, 205-
pound junior English major from
Yorkville, Ill. He runs the 100 in
9.9.

“We've seen movies where tacklers
had good angles on him and he just
simply ran off and left them. He’s
not the triple threat that Agnew
was, but he is every bit as good
a runner,” W&L coach Lee Mec-
Laughlin says.

Johnson is averaging something
over seven yards a carry. He’s gained
500 yards in Sewanee’s first six
games which, incidentally, were all
easy wins.

Sewanee defeated Randolph-Ma-
con, 34-13, Centre, 34-0, and Hamp-
den-Sydney, 28-7. W&lL lost to all
three, 8-0, 8-0, and 21-0.

Sewanee was undefeated in eight
games last year and so will be look-
ing for its 15th straight win.

pull out a victory by three points.

SAE was led by Kester
who swam to three first places in
the medley relay, the breaststroke
and the individual medley.
Chi’s big men were Lawrence and
Thornsen who each had one
and placed high in their other two
events.

Aside from Denman, Clinard of
Beta was the only to get two firsts
as he ran away with
and also won the backstroke. Hus-
ton of KA took the 100 yard free-
style while Clay of SPE was an up-
set winner in the butterfly.

The eleventh annual turkey trot
cross-country race was run last
Friday afternoon as part of Parents’
Weekend, and for the second year
in a row Phi Kappa Sigma captured
individual as well as team honors.
