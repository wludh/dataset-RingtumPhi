Virginia, in 1920. After attending
public schools in New Jersey, he
went to the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, where he earned his
B.S. in 1942 and completed his Ph.D.
in 1946,

In the summers of 1940 and 1941
Dr. Tyree was a teaching assistant at

M.1.T. and an Instructor the last
three years before obtaining his
Ph.D.

Pinney, Hughes Describe Quality of

By EDWARD L, PINNEY
and
DELOS D. HUGHES

Washington and Lee University is
surely one of the most self-applaud-
ed educational institutions in our
society. As is often true of self-
esteem, a certain lack of self-confi-
dence, uneasiness, and anxiety about
the truth is the basis of ours. While
by any fair standard it is likely
that our college is potentially as ex-
cellent as any but a few and poten-
tially more excellent than most, the
extent to which we have realized
this potential is sadly, even tragic-
ally slight.

The numbers of our graduates who
are bank presidents, presidents of
the the American Bar Association
or successful doctors may be im-
pressively large, the average salaries
of our graduates impressively high,
the reputation of the Washington and
Lee gentleman legend; but these are
poor indices of our success when
our contributions to the cultural,
intellectual, and humanitarian as-
pects of life are so meager. Our
graduates do well for themselves but
little for others.

This is one indication—other,
more immediate ones are current
topics of campus conversation—of
the quality of Washington and Lee
life. The quality can best be describ-
ed as generally deficient. This is an
appropriate time and place to ex-
amine the nature of this deficiency,
to outline what our community might
be, and to suggest how we might
improve the quality of our life at
Washington and Lee to reach this
goal.

I

If there is any phase which one
would not apply to Washington and
Lee it is “intellectual excitement.”
In our community instances of this
description are occasions for sur-
prise rather than normal expecta-
tions. Even though the process of
education is an almost complete
mystery, even to those involved in
it we can easily recognize that an
atmosphere of intellectual excite-

ment is the condition in which this
process most often sucessfully takes
place. But there is no intellectual
excitement in our life—little excite-
ment of any sort. It is neither af-
forded by most professors, nor de-
manded by most students. And the
responsibility is charged to both par-
ties. Each at times is guilty of
thwarting the other. Under almost
no circumstances can any excite-
ment be kindled over the number
of seats in the House of Represen-
tatives or the identity of Louis XIV’s
gardner. But neither can excitement
be kindled when prestige is accorded
to minimal academic participation.

This characteristic of Washing -

ton and Lee life is general, in

class and out of class. There is no

adventure, no interest beyond a
superficial level. Almost every as-

pect of the life here seems to con-
spire against it. For instance, those
in our community who might find
some stimulation in the cultural
and artistic side of life are frus-
trated. There is an unfortunate
tendency in men’s colleges to put
the creative arts at the bottom of
curricular and extracurricular
priorities. They are somehow, mis-
takenly, considered inappropriate
or at least nonessential. The re-
sponsibility of the university com-
munity is not only to satisfy what-
ever interests its members may
have when they join the commun-
ity—a responsibility inadequately
met at best—but to develop such
interests. The arts are a funda-
mental and integral part of a lib-
eral education, which is presum-
ably our purpose,

Lexington should be at least a
small oasis in what Mencken refers
to as the Sahara of the Bozart, but
it is just another stop—perhaps a
barely damp spot—in the cultural
desert. A metropolitan community is
not prerequisite for an adequate cul-
tural and artistie life. It is a matter
for our community to accomplish,
and with minimal resources it can be
done. One must give credit to the

Toward An Improved Political System

In an unprecedented move Monday night, the EC pro-
posed a long overdue change in the W&L political system.

The proposal, if passed, will eliminate the possibility of
allowing one party to put its nominees into office unopposed,
Under the proposed system, there will be an excellent oppor-
tunity for the nine houses not in the University Party to unite,
hold primaries this spring, and theoretically set their three best
candidates in competition with the best candidates of the Uni-

versity Party. Without the new

demonstrated, campus elections and consequently, student
government will lose much of their intrinsic value. The new sys-
tem will generate renewed enthusiasm in, and competition for,
student body offices. Also, it will double the number of students
from which to choose the top officers and allow better men a
substantial chance of being elected.

Under the proposed party system, the nominees for office
will not be elected simply by nine men supposedly represent-
ing their houses as each party's clique meeting, but by party
primaries which will allow the whole student body a chance to
represent their choices of nominees. Thus the field of nomi-
nees as well as the electorate itself will attain a broader base.

The stability of the campus political structure, if not the
parties themselves, is an additional advantage of the proposed
system. It would seem imperative that the nine unafhliated
houses unite in order to give themselves and the W&L political
and student government systems a chance.

The referendum on the proposal will be held Wednesday
from 8:15 to 5:00, If the proposal is to pass, a majority of
the student body must vote for it. Thus, it is vital that all stu-
dents vote in the referendum if we are to receive the advant-
ages of a revised political system.

 

Sincere Appreciation

Dean Lewis John, Director of Scholarships and Financial
Aid, has called the Robert E. Lee Scholarship Program, estab-
lished by an anonymous donation of $250,000 to the Univer-
sity in 1955, as “one of the most significant developments at

:

WeL during the past decade.’

The program has made a significant contribution to WeL,
not only for the service provided the Lee Scholars, but also

for the students, faculty, and

sonally and has often been a determining factor in the stu-
dents’ decision to attend W&L.

Art for contributing the one bright
spot in this picture. But music, dra-
ma, creative writing are orphans. The
outlets are minimal, interest more
narrow ithan it should be, the enter-
prises generally ignore or at least
hardly more than perfunctorily en-
couraged. Support for the cultural
and artistic events available in Lex-
ington is hardly overwhelming, nor
is the quality of those events uni-
formly high. Again the responsibili-
ties are mutual ones. All segments
of the community contribute to the
inadequacy, and it will take all of
them to correct it.

The state of culture and the arts
in our life at Washington and Lee
is only a small part of the evidence
that the quality is inadequate, that
there is no excitement. But this
cannot be a comprehensive cata-
logue of all the deficiencies which
contribute to the inadequacy—for
we should have to note then the
incredible absence of anything in
our community approximating an
adequate bookstore, a peculiar
view that the function of a library
is curatorial rather than service
to the community upon which its
academic work largely rests, and
many other curious features of our
situation.

Dr. Edward L, Pinney

But one needs to consider in any
such discussion as this the matter
of the fraternity because it is a large
and important part of the Washing-
ton and Lee life. There is probably
no one associated with the Univer-
sity who seriously maintains that
fraternities are all that they might
reasonably be expected to be, and
no one who is completely satisfied
with the present fraternity situation.
With regard to the criterion of in-
tellectual excitement, few of us
would seriously maintain that fra-
ternities contribute a great deal to it,
notwithstanding the Contact pro-
gram just concluded. It seems clear
that they could and desirable that
they should, but to criticize that they
do not is to mistake a symptom of
our difficulty for its cause. Frater-
nity men—who are rather inclined
to overdefensiveness in the face of
even friendly criticism—are likely to
take the view that their responsi-
bilities are other than academic and
intellectual, that it is sufficient that
the fraternities do not detract from
the academic and intellectual goals
of the community, nor from the in-
tellectual excitement which hope-
fully it generates

This is a quite reasonable posi-
tien, even though we would en-
courage a more positive rele for
the fraternity in contributing to the
intellectual goals of our life. But
is it true that the Washington and
Lee fraternity does not detract
from the academic and intellectual
purposes which are the commun-
ity’s raison d'etre? The view that
fraternities are detrimental in this
respect is based on an acceptance
of the fraternities’ own inflated
myth of their effectiveness. In only
rare cases, or in only superficial
matters, does a fraternity mold a
man significantly in such situations
as ours, It is probably unfair and
certainly futile to charge a frater-
nity with responsibility for the
academic, aleoholic, or urinary sins
of its members.

Within the more formal frame-
work of our life at Washington and
Lee, the absence of excitement, the
quality of the life, is also disap-
pointing. One notices an unhealthy
attachment to what is a perversion
of traditionalism, Tradition should
not mean stasis, But our profes-
sors are not bold, nor are our stu-
dents. The major evidence of in-
novative thinking forwarded by our
administration recently has been
met either with indifference or de-
fensiveness rather than in the
constructive spirit it was intended.
Our self study may yet help us out
of this rut, but a great many vest-
ed interests are at stake and the
results can all too easily be worth-
less.

Variety and experimentation would
seem to be good guides for us in our
curricular arrangements. If ortho-
dox teaching methods, course offer-
ings, format of hours, grading, ex-
aminations, and degree requirements
« rd no excitement, then we had
better be unorthodox. When it is
vital to be spirited in approach to
these matters, we have been listless
and slavish. Why not a course with
no final examination? Why not a
course which meets for three one-
hour lectures one week and one
three-hour seminar the next, or not
at all the next if the instructor thinks
this valuable? Why not consider ar-
ranging our curriculum to concen-
trate elementary courses in 6 or
8 week blocks? We have not ser-
iously considered open and perhaps
desirable alternatives. We have pre-
cluded introducing excitement into
our community by an inclination for
uniformity where variety and ex-
perimentation are in order.

Another important aspect of life
here is indicative of its quality, We
are committed at Washington and
Lee to the in loco parentis con-
cept. What this in fact means in
most cases is that the University
is asked to exercise certain respon-
sibilities which parents never did;
for if they had, the University
would not need to. The in loco
parentis commitment cannot be
meaningfully and creatively imple-
mented by the means available to
a university, A parent’s responsi-
bility is to provide for his son a
foundation for assuming the moral
and social responsibilities of man-
hood and an inclination to do so.
Restraint upon one’s freedom on
the eve of his maturity is a poor
preparation for making responsible
decisions when faced with free
choices.

The University imposes class at-
tendance on the student. He typi-
cally interprets the device as a pro-
tection for the egos of faculty mem-
bers who would otherwise lecture to
near empty classrooms. It is the
sort of truth which hurts. There may
indeed be sound reasons for re-
quiring attendance under certain
conditions, but there seem to us no
valid reasons for requiring it as a
general rule. The reasons which are
ordinarily advanced for a rigid un-
iform cut policy—for instance, that
to allow the professor discretion in
the latter fosters a popularity con-
test among the faculty—represent an
unwarranted denigration of the stu-
dents’ perceptiveness, or an over-
emphasis on faculty sensibilities or
both.

To the extent that our resistance
to a four or five day week is based
on the University’s standing in loco
parentis, again the justification is
unsatisfactory, The abuses which
would accompany an extended

weekend are manifestations of
other more basic problems, just
as with certain deficiencies of fra-
ternities. Free time does not cause
abuses, nor does restriction really
deal with the source of such abuse.
The opportunities provided to all
members of our community by this
innovation—primarily the oppor-
tunity for independent pursuit of
interests contributing to one’s in-
tellectual, moral, and even social
growth, both in and out of Lex-
ington—are incalculably valuable.

Again, the in loco parentis prob-
lem is the mutual responsibility of
all segments of our community. If
the attitude of the administration
and faculty has not been enlighten-
ed, they have certainly been present-
ed with little evidence from stu-
dents to justify changing it. If
Washington and Lee is_ in certain
respects in the prep school category,
this position can be convincingly de-
fended as necessary to protect both
the University and tthe students.
Protection, however, is not an ap-
propriate part of education.

The description of Washington
and Lee life above is, we believe,
a reasonable, although partial, view
of our situation. Most of the brighter
aspects have been ignored. They
certainly exist and should be ap-
plauded, but not applauded so vig-
orously that we lose sight of our
failings. What our life might be is not
nearly so easy to specify, but it
seems ito us encompassed by two
interrelated ideas especially. We
should be intellectually curious, in-
tensely rather than casually so,
and we should be a true community.

The purpose of formal education
are not exhausted by the transfer
of a certain amount of information
from mind to mind, This is an im-
portant part of it, but by no means
the most important. The essential

Dr. Delos D. Hughes

task is to develop intellectual curi-
osity, a desire to learn and know.
Probably we cannot hepe to create
this curiosity but only to develop
it where it exists, Intellectual curi-
osity means that the important
questions are Why? and How?
rather than What? and When?
The intellectually curious man is
not a man without facts—on which
we tend to put far too much em-
phasis in any case—but a man who
is not force-fed facts under the
pretense that he is being educated.
Ile is a man driven to seek the

rather the broadest of men with
an interested and ordinarily some
competence in almost anything

brought to his attention,

It is sometimes assumed that part
of the university’s function is to
inculcate certain values in its mem-
bers. But the indoctrination of men
with particular values—whether of
gentlemanly manner or conventional
dress or even intellectual curiosity—
is not really the proper business of
this or any university. If the values
the community has __ traditionally
cherished are sound, in a communi-
ty characterized by a spirit of in-
tellectual curiosity those values will
be sustained as new members enter
and are invited to examine them.

The ideal of a true community is
no easier to communicate. A_ basic
implication is that divisions within
the group are minimzed. The Wash-
ington and Lee experience should
be a situation of learning together
rather than a situation of teaching
on the one hand and learning on the
other. This ideal is not easy to un-
derstand or to accept, much less to
accomplish. Teachers often think
there is nothing to learn from stu-
dents, students that they have noth-
ing to offer to the teacher. These
opinions reflect only an inadequate
view of what we are all here to-
gether for. If the teacher is only a
more colorful, handier, more inter-
esting, mobile textbook, then he is
highly overpaid and much too es-
teemed. His value is always as a
catalyst, only occasionally as a ref-
erence, Having passed along some
paths which all the intellectually cu-
rious must retrace, he can assist in
making the trip more interesting and
prevent some wastes of effort But
finally the “student” and the “teach-
er’ must learn together if either
is to gain anything more than his
degree or his paycheck. They must
coniribute to the growth of each
other in almost a literal way.

If this communality is eur goal,
then certain perceived impediments
to the community's fulfillment
must be removed. Professors must
be approachable, students not in-
hibited. The major obstacle is not
that there is no respect for or
interest in one group by the other,
but rather that too often neither is
especially interested in learning
anything new. When both groups
are truly committed to learning,
both intellectually curious, then
the problems of rapport will be
few and easily solved.

A final the view of
what Washington and Lee might be
like. What of the non-academic and
non-intellectual, ie., of the social?
Probably for the student (and the
unmarried faculty member) the so-
cial situation in Lexington will never
be ideal. But given the limitations
inherent in our situaton, we need
not make the social any less satisfac-
tory by divorcing it from the rest of
the community's life. The social is
complementary to the purposes of
the community, not contradictory.
The integration of the community in
this respect may be less ‘
plete because of substantial differ-
ences of responsibilities, and
social preferences; but in com-
munity where intellectual interests
are similar a great deal of reward-
ing social integration can take place.
If by social life we continue to mean
the independent enjoyment of cer-
tain pleasures at the same time and
in the same places where others are,
or of pleasures for which others
ire acquired as props, then our social
life will continue to be unsatisfac-

W&L Wins 2 Events:

BY JOHN

Trackmen;

GRAHAM

The Spiders of the University of Richmond wove their
web around the Washington and Lee track team as the Gen-
erals dropped their spring track debut 97-44.

Outmanned by the Richmonders, the Generals managed
only two first places in 17 events. Twelve second places, how-
ever, kept the Generals within respectable distance of the

Southern Conference School.

High hurdler Mike Goode turned in
a top-notch performance, winning the
120-yard high hurdles in :17.3. The
other W&L win came in the javelin as
Tommy Sparks hurled it 157 feet for
first place. Ric Mynttinen, the Gener-
als’ top man in that event, pulled a
muscle before the meet, and came in
fourth.

Big points for the Spiders came in
the two relays, which they won, and
in their sweep of the 100-yard dash,
a feat that they had duplicated in the
state indoor meet at VMI.

The Generals held their own best
in the field events, scoring 27 of their
44 points. The Spiders scored 36 points
in the field events as compared with
their 61 in the runnnig events.

Luke Meadors and John Graham
led the way in the field events, scoring
two seconds apiece. Meadors, a fresh-
man, scored seconds in the broad
jump and in the triple jump. Graham
placed second in the high jump and
in the pole vault, Freshman Mark
Kelso placed second in the shot put
as did Ted Larson in the discus.

In the running events, besides
Goode’s win, Andy Kilpatrick placed
second in the mile, and also in the
two-mile, Jim Thompson took sec-
ond in the 880, and freshman Bob
Miller was second in the 330-yard in-
termediate hurdles.

The Generals have a Friday date
with Old Dominion College in Nor-
folk before Spring vacation.

‘Spring Sports Start
Action Next Week

The 1965 Washington and Lee
full start next week with only the golf
and freshman tennis squads not seeing

any action.

The baseball team gets the week
underway a little early with a scrim-
mage at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon
agains VMI at their field. Coach Joe
Lyles says either Pete Heumann or
Bill Rasmussen will start, with Heu-
mann more likely. No pitcher will
go more than two or three innings.

Then on Friday the Generals have
another scrimmage, this one against
New Haven College here at 3:15.
Coach Lyles emphasized that both
games will be just practice games
aimed at checking the team’s potential.
He added, “Ill be just a spectator
looking the team over.”

Next to open the season will be
the lacrosse squad on Tuesday after-
noon. They will face Swarthmore in
a scrimmage here at 3:15. Then on
Thursday afternoon, the W&L la-

lar game against Ohio State here at
3:15. Coach Dana Swan will be start-
ing his first season as head lacrosse
coach.

The freshman lacrosse team also
opens the season next week. They'll
go against Episcopal High School on
Friday afternoon there.

Phi Kaps Win IM Track Title;
Win Bowling, Ping Pong Also

By JOHN BEAGLE

Phi Kappa Sigma won this year’s
Intramural Track Meet nosing out
Sigma Phi Epsilon in the last two
events.

Phi Kap had 84 meet points while
SPE had 66 to pick up second. SAE
was third with 49. This is the second
straight year Phi Kap has won the
meet.

Meadors Wins Two

One of the top individual perform-
ances of the meet was turned in by
Luke Meadors of SPE with two firsts
and a second. Meadors won the broad
jump, took second in the triple jump,
and helped his team gain a first place
in the 440 yard relay.

John Wiley of Phi Gam was also a
double winner as he took the 440 and
220 yard dashes. Bob Miller of SPE
also had two firsts and a second in
winning the 120 yard high hurdles,
the 440 yard relay, and gaining a close
second in the 330 yard intermediate
hurdles. Miller most likely would
have been the meet’s only triple win-
ner had he not been slowed up by
some stray dogs in the intermediate
hurdles.

Morrison Upsets Meadors

Morrison of Sigma Nu kept Meadors
from being a triple winner as he up-
set the SPE freshman in the triple
jump.

Other meet winners included Lar-
son of Phi Psi in the discus, Goode
of Phi Psi in the intermediate hurdles,
Kelso of Sigma Chi in the shot, Bru-
ton of Lambda Chi in the mile, Skin-
ner of Delt in the javelin, Murfin of
Sigma Nu in the 880 and Griffin of
SAE in the high jump.

This year’s meet saw 16 teams
entered with a total of 137 partici-
pants. The two days for the meet were
both excellent weather-wise. The only
snag in an otherwise well-rounded
meet was a protest in two parts which
was disallowed in a meeting of the in-
tramural board on Tuesday afternoon.

Phi Kap’s Win Ping Pong

On Monday night Phi Kap won its.
first of three straight intramural |
charmpionships by wnining ping pong. |

 

After Phi Kap defeated ZBT, 5-0, on |

Thursday night, Phi Delt and Sigma |
Nu both forfeited rather than play
the Phi Kap powerhouse. ZBT came
in second, Sigma Nu third, and Phi |
Delt fourth.

Phi Kap’s line up was so strong and
full of depth that it swept through
seven straight matches winning all by
a 5-0 score. In the last four years only
the Delt softball teams, the Phi Gam
volleyball teams, and the SAE basket-
ball teams shared as much domination
over the competition as this year’s Phi
Kap ping pong team.

This was the second year in a row
that Phi Kap won the crown. Phi Kap
was led by Doug Bielenberg who has
never lost a game of ping pong in two
years. The other three singles play-
ers were Kiah Ford, Meade Cadot,
and Forrest Dickinson. The doubles
team was Pete Johnson and Tom Cox.

Phi Kaps Win Bowling Too

In bowling on Tuesday night Phi |

Kap won its third crown in two days

by defeating ZBT in bowling 4-0.

Phi Kap had games of 818-893-820 for

a total of 2531 to ZBT’s 723-767-763
total of 2253.

tory, for it is not really social at
all. But if it really means, as it
should, our enjoyment of these
pleasures with others, our sharing
them and communicating them, then
it is simply another way of learning
in a different context.

iil

The problems identified above
can be solved and the ideal pro-
posed can be effected, Basically
two reorientations are required,
both of which are feasible and
probably essential if we wish to
improve the quality of Washing-
ton and Lee life. In the first place
we must attract to our community
those who will take advantage of
the opportunity it affords, The stu-
dents at Washington and Lee who
lack above-average intellectual
capaticies are few, although they
perhaps outnumber those possess-
ing vigorous, above-average intel-
lectual appetites. There are prob-
ably few professor who have
little to offer us, but a much larger
number who do in fact offer us
little. Though the specific sugges-
tions which follow relate mostly
to the student body, some are ap-
propriate for the faculty as well,
acknowledging that there are fac-
tors in the professorial market
which the University cannot con-
trol.

The absence of intellectual excite-
ment at Washington and Lee is due
partly to the uniformity—of back-
ground, opinions, interests, expecta-
tions—among its members. If it is
indeed only coincidence that the
faculty with truly rare exceptions is
Protestant of Anglo-Saxon extrac-

tion, it is certainly no coincidence
that the student body in spite of a
more diverse religio-ethnic back-

ground is predominantly from a un-
iform socio-economic environment.
It is stated policy of this university
that a way will be found for any
qualified student who wishes to at-
tend to pursue an education here.
This is without doubt a sincere and
determined policy. But the fact re-
mains that Washington and Lee at-
tracts mainly certain types of men

and has not cultivated the interest of
other types. The resulting uniformi-|
ty is dulling. The confirmation of
one’s opinions by those around him
it not educational. The challenge
of opposing points of view may be.
The challenges one meets here today
are largely superficial. The Univer-
sity must act to introduce diversity
into its membership of drastically
reorienting the admissions program
to attract a broader variety of stu-
dents. The argument that we are en-
titled to select associates we happen
to prefer is not at all relevant here.
The question is not to what a man is
entitled, but what conditions are
most favorable for learning, for
building and sustaining curiosity.

It is probably true that within
the goals set for them, those pri-
marily involved in the admissions
process do their job well, But we
have set the wrong goals, We must
do more than identify and select
the capable, alert, and polished;
we must identify and select the
willing, interested, and curious.
The proud annual recitation of our
rising college board scores is not
reflected in a comparable rise in
level of academic interest. The dif-
ference here could mean that we
are over-attentive to superficial or
misleading indicators of probable
future performance.

If it takes time, effort, and money
to detect those who, regardless of
scores and standings, will actively
seek an education at Washington and
Lee rather than just a degree, these
are resources well spent. It seems
reasonable that the faculty should)
be pressed into service in identifying

 

these men

from faculty ranks to assist the}
Dean of Admissions
term—for they are particularly

qualified by experience to be able
to judge the quality we most need.
In any event a life of discriminating
quality at Washington and Lee de-
mands that we seek to exclude those
who are simply expected or other-
wise obligated to be here, and to
include those who are determined
to contribute a heavy part of their
energies toward the end of becom-
ing educated men.

The low level of academic seri-
ousness is sometimes attributed to
the disinclination of serious stu-
dents to apply to Washington and
Lee in the first place. This is no
doubt true and demands immediate
remedy, But we have been happy
to accept the capable but unmoti-
vated student in licu of the intellec-

ally motivated in the first place.

An enthusiastic student does not
permit any but the most hopeless
instructors to dampen his enthus-
ism. Even if the price is a few
empty desks and dormitory rooms,
we would do well to pay that
price,

In the second place, if we wish to
improve Washington and Lee life we
must raise our academic standards
by banishing forever the confusion
between quality and quantity. To
raise the passing grade level, to re-
quire more facts learned, more
pages read, more problems worked,
is not to raise academic standards
in any meaningful sense, for there is
no qualitative improvement.

In most areas of academic in-
struction, perhaps not all, the
quality can be improved by a
simple reorientation of effort, What
needs to be done is to involve
the student in solving the current
problems of the discipline. It is
nonsense to reply that the student
cannot even understand the prob-
lems, much less solve them. If he
finds these problems interesting
and if he is as capable as we ex-
pect our students to be, he will
try to understand and to solve the
problem, Never mind the flops.
Even if no basic contributions are
made, he has learned something in
the process,

The possibilitties here are perhaps
less easily imagined in fields other
than the natural sciences where the
problems of laser physics or the
DNA molecule may be fairly readily
perceived. But in a basic sense a
social science or humanities profes-

perhaps with a full-time| sor can also share with his students |

ing a different sort of person to our
community and by affording him a
different sort of opportunity here.
This is not all that is necessary to
improve the quality of Washington
and Lee life, but it is a beginning.
If we value our community we
should be willing to exert the effort
required to improve it. In addition
it seems to us that we might be
more tolerant of our critics and
recognize the compliment usually
implied by criticism. Effective criti-
cism most frequently derives from
considerable anger or disappoint-
ment and from considerable affec-
tion. The reader who has struggled
to the end of this overlong presen- |
tation of unsystematic ideas may by
now have concluded that the criti-|
cism is not effective, but its sources |
are the same—anger, disappoint-
ment, affection, and—most import-
antly—optimism.

A message of importance to sophomore men

if you've got what it takes
to be an Army Officer
you may qualify for this new

on-campus training program

A new Army ROTC program starts this

coming Summer for sophomore men who apply
prior to May 1—only 3,000 applicants to be accepted

If you're a sophomore now attending one of the 247 colleges and universities that
offer Army Officer training—or you plan to transfer to one of these schools next
Fall—you may qualify for the new two-year Army ROTC program.

This new program —designed especially for college men who have not taken
Army ROTC during their first two years—will commence with six weeks of
field training this coming Summer, beginning June 14. Then you'll have
on-campus training during your junior year . . . six additional weeks at camp
during the following Summer . . . and more on-campus training during your
senior year. Even flight training is offered at some schools.

ROTC training is really a process of learning to organize and direct others—

to be a leader. Consider how important this ability can be to you throughout life;
yet, to acquire it you will spend relatively little time in the ROTC classroom.
You'll obtain valuable junior management experience . . . a fuller and richer
campus life . . . extra spending money ($40 per month during your junior

and senior school years, and even more during Summer training) . . . and,

when you graduate, an Army Officer's commission as Second Lieutenant.

Then you'll normally spend two interesting years on active duty, often

abroad with opportunities for travel.

Talk to the Professor of Military Science on your campus about this
opportunity. Ask him to describe this new short program in detail.

Or send in the coupon below for complete information. There's no obligation
involved, and you'll not be subjected to any “hard sell” recruiting effort.
The kind of men the Army wants can decide for themselves if this new

opportunity is right for

don't

if you're good enough to be an Army Officer,
settle for less. Sign up now for Army ROTC.
