Region Managers Named
For ’68 Mock Convention

Nine regional managers and a
financial chairman for the 1968
Mock Republican Convention have
been selected. Convention Coordi-

Saunders expressed pleasure with
the calibre of the new appointees.
There were forty-nine applications
for the ten positions available. In
a joint statement, Mayfield and
Saunders noted that “very few of
those who applied were not quali-
fied to serve. It was a question of
degree of qualification, and a diffi-
cult one to answer. We picked a
first-rate group which will do a
first-rate job.”

Barry Vaught, KA sophomore, was
appointed Interim Financial Chair-
man of the convention. He is vice-
president of his class and a mem-
ber of the Assimilation Committee.

This summer, from June 21 to
August 31, Washington and Lee
will be the site of a Summer Insti-
tute on Languages. The Institute,
which is being sponsored by the
United States Office of Education
under the National Defense Educa-
tion Act, is being directed by Dr.
L. L. Barrett, professor of romance
language at W&L. Other members
of the W&L faculty who will serve
on the staff of the Institute are Dr.
G. F. Drake, who is the assistant
director, and Dr. C. W. Barritt, who
will instruct a class in linguistics.

The Institute is being conducted
with the aspiration of raising the
standard of proficiency in the teach-
ing of French and Spanish at the
high school level in and around the
state of Virginia. For this purpose
the Institute has planned a pro-
gram which will atempt to saturate
the participants in their particular
language for the 8-week period. The
students will be orientated in French

Major Address to Examine Role
Of American Citizens Abroad

By LARRY MEEKS
Managing Editor

Col. Francis P. Miller, currently a special assistant in the
Department of State, has accepted an invitation to speak at
Washington and Lee’s CONTACT weekend, according to
chairman Blaine Brownwell. Col. Miller’s major address, en-
titled “Americans Abroad and Their Task” is tentatively set
for 7:30 p.m., Sunday March 14.

A native of Kentucky, Col.

Miller has had a distinguished

career in the Army, in government service and in various re-

ligious organizations.

He received an A.B. degree at Washington and Lee in
1914 and was Washington and Lee’s first Rhodes Scholar. As
a Rhodes Scholar he attended Oxford University and received

a B.A. degree in 1921 and an

M.A. degree in 1923.

In 1927-28 he was a student at the graduate Institute of
International Studies at Geneva Switzerland. He holds honor-
ary degrees from Centre College and from Washington and

in each language. Selection of the
participants will be made by a com-
mitte appointed to screen applica-
tions from interested high school
teachers. The committee will base
their decision upon a standard of
minimimal requirements, with the
intention of assembling a represen-
tative and felicitous cross-section
of teachers from the Virginia area.
Dr. Barrett further stated thta all
applications would be considered
without regard to race, color, creed
or national origin.

This is the first time Washington
and Lee has hosted such a program,
and this will be the first time in 3
years that such an institute has been
located in Virginia.

Dr. L. L. Barrett commenting on
the new program said, “The idea

actually originated with President)
deserves.

Cole last year and he
most of the credit for securing the
program at Washington and Lee.”
Barrett went on to explain that
he had worked with the State De-

partment of Education on numer-|
ous occasions and was asked to take |
over the program last spring. Dur-/
ing the summer Dr. Barrett visited |

several colleges throughout the

county in order to gain an idea of|

how their programs ran. Upon his
return to campus this fall, he drew
a proposed program for presenta-
tion to the government.

“Actually its quite a feather in!

our cap,” said Barrett. “The pro-
cess of election for grants of this
type program is competitive and
usually twice as many schools ap-
ply for grants as those which
receive them.”

The selection

of schools for this

type grant is made on the basis of)

the presentation made to the state
department, the insructors available
to teach the courses, and the en-
thusiasm expressed by the adminis-
tration of the school applying

can

* Jefferson College.

Friday Edition

 

Use the Bus Service

“Use the Bus Service” signs will soon be distributed over
the campuses of W&L, VMI, and the local girls’ schools. The
Ring-tum Phi heartily seconds this suggestion.

The Bus Service, which provides weekend transportation

for students’ dates and is sponsored by the IFC, was begun) |
on a temporary basis a few months ago. It was understandably | |
inefficient at first. Beginning with Fancy Dress, however, the},
buses will be put on a regular schedule which will not only |

provide transportation back on Saturday night for visitors
from the local girls’ schools, but will also bring them over in

the afternoon.

Such a system should certainly be a boon to the social life
at W&L where one of the most frequent complaints of those
who do not have cars is that is is just too much trouble to date.
Paying a girl’s bus ticket might prove a little more expensive
than a car pool but there are obvious compensations—phone

bills being one.

The greatest advantage to come from using the bus service

though is that it will eliminate
will it be extremely convenient

the driving hazard. Not only
to drive no further than Red

Square for a date but it will also be extremely safe. It has
been a constant source of amazement to us that despite the
distances that students drive each weekend and the conditions
under which ond over which they drive that there are still so
few serious car accidents. We can not help but believe though
that in the past few years of our relatively good driving record
that we have just been lucky. We hope to see our good record
continue, and the best way to do this is by making use of the

bus service.

We Were Wondering .. .

We were wondering if it is necessary that the stacks in the
library be closed between 5 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. every night.
We were also wondering why checking out a book is such a

complicated practice.

These practices at the library are irritating all year but
especially at this time of year when so many students are

working on research papers. If

one choses to leave his source

books in the study rooms behind the stacks, he is restricted in
the hours that he can work, and if he choses to check out all
the books that he needs, he must go through the tedious
process of filling out twice as many cards as books to be used.
There seems to be some room for improvement.

—K. M.

 

 

Student Opinion

 

Rigid Grading Lessens Student’s

By WARREN MONTGOMERY
Feature Editor

A fact of the recent history of
the W&L intellectual community is
the great hue and cry that arises
over the suposed
lack of scholastic
_ interest on the
part of the stu-
| dents, and it is
true to some ex-
‘tent. Many W&L
f students take lit-
tle voluntary in-

terest in their
studies — they
study because the
automatic rule

dragoons them in-
to studying. For a college of this
type, one that admits the academic
uppercrust of American high schools,
this is a curious and unfortunate

 

problem.

The faculty, which seems to be
most concerned, makes constant ef-
forts to explain this phenomenon,
but its ideas usually gravitate to
the usual whipping boy, the fra-
ternities. Certainly fraternities are
partly to blame for the student’s
avoidance of intellectual thought,
but I believe that their role has been
much over-emphasized. What the
faculty members overlook is per-
haps a prime cause for intellectual
stagnation—their own approach to
grading.

W&L’s faculty is an excellent
one; nevertheless, they perhaps go
about trying to correct student in-
tellectual apathy in the wrong way.
This age—marked by great tech-
nological advances and the con-
sequent necessity for leadership
by an educated elite, plus the in-
creasing difficulty of getting em-
ployment without superior educa-

Agent 000 Ends Squash In 007 Fashion

By BRUCE W. RIDER
Friday Columnist

Bzz. Bzz. Bzzzz.

Damn—I hope it’s a wrong num-
ber, thought British Agent 000.

P’s voice came clearly over the
intercom. “000? Come to my office
at once.”

000 put the papers on his desk in
order and filed them away. Why
would P want to see him?

P glanced up as 000 enter the of-
fice and strode up to the massive
mahogany desk.

“Sit down if you like. Go on
I won't bite you.”

With a weak grin, 000 turned
down the offered cigar and sat
looking at his left shoe, Some fool
in the tram had stepped on his
toe and ruined a good polish,

P spoke again. “000—I've got an
assignment for you.”

“Me, sir? Isn't there anyone else?
I still have some reading and filing
to do, and. ...”

“No, 000,” said P evenly, “we
want you. Matter of fact the P.M.
requested you specifically for this
assignment.”

Won't vote for him next election,
now will 1, said 000 to himself,

P lit another cigar and puffed
at 000. “Let's have a look at your
w &

“My what, sir?”
“Your weapon. You know. Your
gun, Bang bang.”

“Oh, that. I think it's in my
desk, At least that’s where it was
the last time I looked,”

“Well, 000, just make sure you
have it for this task. You may need
it if you run into trouble.”

“How nasty.”

Behind the clouds of greenish
smoke P spoke again. “I've booked
you on a flight to Paris in an
hour. We want to locate the ene-
my's HQ and you're the man for
the job. What? HQ stands for
headquarters, 000,”

Reaching into a drawer P pulled
out a small black case. “Here.
Special Section has worked up this

little item for you. Everything's
here: Drammamine, chewing gum,
aspirin, and the like. The weather's
clear so your flight should be

 

smooth. Do try not to be ill again.”
P pressed a button on his desk

while 000 checked over his new
kit.
A slender, silvery-looking man

came in, carrying a bowler and a
black umbrella.

“Pay attention, now, 000,” said
P. “Equipment Section has de-
veloped some things for your as-
signment. Come on, let's have it.”

The equipment man first display-
ed the bowler, which was made of
steel, in case someone should crack
000 on the heard. The umbrella was
more intricate. It contained a re-
loadable smoke bomb and flare-
shooting apparatus.

“So you see, 000,” said P, “when
you reach the enemy you will open
the bumbershoot and our men will
know the location of the enemy
HQ, I mean headquarters.”

000 took the equipment. Opening
the umbrella he discovered that
it worked just like the man from
Equipment Section had described.
After the smoke cleared and the
flares were doused, P gave 000 his
plane ticket and warm good-
bye.

000 tidied up his desk and bid his
secretary farewell.

“They're sending you? How cute.”

On the plane to Paris 000 tried in
vain to recall the passwords. British
agents had special phrases to iden-
tify each other but 000 had a poor

P once had given him the words
on paper to learn and then swallow,
but 000 had gotten dreadfully sick
from the paper and had forgotten
the words anyway

In New York he'd been ap-
proached by a man in Pennsylva-
nia Station who said, “Taxi, Mis-
ter?” and 000 had spent $26.78
riding around Brooklyn before dis-
covering that this man wasn't the
right one after all.

On his most recent assignments he
had solved the problem of pass-
words altogether. At the airport or
train station he would simply go
around saying, “I'm 000. Are you
my contact?”

This time he needn't have worried

Two large yellow men met him

 

and threw him into the back of a
large yellow car.

After beating him on the bowler
to no avail they put him in a sack
and told him to keep quiet if he
—— what was good for him. He

id.

After what 000 considered to be
a goodly length of time the car
stopped and they all got out. 000 was
let out of the sack and he saw that
they were on a dock. He was led up
a gangplank to a sleek yacht.

000 was taken immediately to the
captain's quarters.

The door opened and 000 was face
to face with Col. Klunk, the evil
head of the crime syndicate,
SQUASH.

Col. Kluk looked at 000 with
disgust.

“Look who they sent, LOOK
WHO THEY SENT! 000. Don't
they think we're important? Aren't
we big time?”

“I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Klunk. It
really wasn't my idea.”

“That's okay, 000, Nobody's blam-
ing you. It's just the principle of
the thing.”

Col. Klunk looked sadly out over
the water. “This shoots the plan
We were going to hold a British
agent for ransom, but we can't get
anything for 000.”

000 followed Col. Klunk out to the
deck. It had begun to drizzle.

“Here,” said Klunk. “Gimmie
that damn umbrella.”

Before 000 could speak the um-
brella was snatched away and a
moment later the boat was filled
with smoke and the sky with
flares. Soon the boat was swarm-
ing with British agents and French
police. The members of SQUASH
were flattened.

000 waited for a clear day and
then flew back to London

He sat down at his desk
sighed deeply
Bzz, Bez. Bezzz. 000 hoped it would
be a wrong number

Gilmore, a

nally sent this setter to Miss Syl-

Editor's note: Mr.

in response to an article that Miss
Doughty wrote for our paper,
which severely criticized the so-
cial life of the W&L student. We
will be happy to either print or
pass on to Mr, Gilmore any com-
ments you might like to make,
Dear Miss Doughty:

We W&L alumni received the
Ring-tum Phi two weeks late due
to the gross inefficiency of the busi-
ness operation in Lexington, so I
have just had an opportunity today
(Dec. 8) to read your inflammatory
statements about the sheep at W&L.

There is a lot of truth in your
“lament,” but in some fit of obtuse,
tortured reasoning, you criticize the
fraternity system for the activities
of the “knaves” from W&L. For
your information, it was the same
fraternity system when the “knights
from Washington Hall made their
conquests by brandishing wit, irre-
sistable charm, and perish the
thought—good form.”

It was also the same fraternity
system when your Mothers were at
Hollins in the 20's and 30's, and
the same fraternities were at W&L
as far back as 1855 when some Wa-
hoos from Charlottesville establish-
ed Phi Kappa Psi at the then Wash-
ington College, well before the “un-
civil war,” and just shortly after
Hollins began business in 1842.

The fraternity cannot, in one or

two years, re-do the initial 18 years)

of these “knaves,” or “knights's” lives
Actually, the weaking of the W&L
fraternity system in the past ten
years by various acts of omission

and commission by the W&L admin-|

tration and faculty is, in my opinion,
the basic reason the knaves
able to effect the court coup, as

you put it. In addition, many more
students now live out of fraterni-
ties in houses, apartments, rooms,

(Continued on page 4)

   

were)

tion—places great pressure on
universities, including Washing-
ton and Lee. As a result, profes-
sors try to crack down—to try to
weed out the “good student” from
the mediocre mass. They perform
this weeding operation by giving
the lowest grades possible—one or
two A’s, few B’s, and a great ma-
jority of C’s, D’s, and F’s in an
average-size class.

Failure of Tough Policy

Does this “get tough” policy fulfill
its intended purpose of causing
greater effort by the student? Not at
all; in fact, just the opposite occurs.
To illustrate the point, let us accept
two very probable assumptions: that
most students of sufficient caliber
to be admitted here have an in-
herent (if latent) intellectual curios-
ity, and that most students actually
do or will work hard.

Professors too often assume that
because students do poorly, they
are not working, but very often
they work hard and make an in-
ferior showing anyway. Why? Be-
cause a combination of both hard
work and intellectual curiosity is
necessary for a good classroom
performance. A student may stug-
le with a difficult text for hours
and learn nothing, even though
he has worked hard. His failure
to accomplish any learning is due
simply to his lack of interest.

The problem then, is to arouse
intellectual interest in the student.
Under the popular “get tough” poli-
cy, however, a sequence like the
following often occurs:

Psychology of Bad Grades

A student enters an English course
with enthusiasm and works hard
at it. However, the professor's first
test is difficult, the student makes
mistakes, and since his paper was
only 10th highest in a class of 30,
he receives a C. The students
thought process goes as follows: “I
worked hard in this course, but I got
a low grade. Obviously, I must be
basically uninterested (since I
couldn’t lack the intelligence).
Therefore, I won't work so hard as
before, since I am not interested
in English anyhow.”

Subsequent examination fiascoes,
this time caused both by the teach-
er’s “get tough” attitude and by
the student's lessened study, re-
affirm the student’s conviction that
he has no interest in English. To

‘Goldfinger’ Is
Best Bond Yet

By JAMES JENNINGS

Broads, booze, horses, planes, cars,
gold and James Bond make Gold-
finger the most popular movie of
present selection of flicks going
around the country. Goldfinger has
broken attendance records in Dal-
las, Chicago, and Danville, Virginia.
In Danville the
James Bond flick
was the highlight
of the social sea-
son. It seems that
the stud from
British Exports
has some kind of
hold on the view-
ers that were
awed by Brando
in One-Eyed Jack,
impressed by
McQueen in Mag-
nificent Seven, and bowled over by
Newman in Hud,

The Best

Goldfinger is probably the best of
the James Bond movies to date.
It is the most absurd by far and
has more smooth acting than the
other two. Bond's automobile is a big
hit as 007 is himself. He drives a
Austin-Martin that does everything
but get the girl; so, between the
driver and the car nothing is left
out. The women in this movie are
plentiful, generous and appreciative
of the talents of the patriotic civil
servant.

Oddjob stands out as a dedicated

servant to Goldfinger. With his hat
in his hand he faithfully serves
his master right to the end when he
must sacrifice his life so that Gold-
finger can succeed. This is a noble
| act which is all for nought, needless
to say.
There is no way to evaluate a
| James Bond Movie because the
| movie merely seeks to run a cool
| and absurd story on the screen with
a stud idol, good looking women,
and lots of music and technicolor.
|The movie maker pulls it off very
well in Goldfinger and rumor has it
| that an American Company is going
ito make some James Bond flicks,
| with the great great French inspec-
tor Peter Sellers playing James
| Bond

Incentive

he is making bad grades in. Other-
wise, he will have to believe that
he has an inferior intellect, and
that he will rarely do.

Psychology of Good Grades

On the other hand, another stu-
dent lucks into a good grade on
the first test. He studied the right
cold quiz, was feeling better that
morning, ete. Under the teacher’s
grading method he receives a B, or
even an A. He thinks, “Gee, I really
know that English cold. I’ve got
real talent (even genius!) in Bng-
lish. This is really a fascinating
subject—I'll have my true genius
out.”

The second student, his intellect
flattered, expands his original
curiosity in his subject and takes
a genuine interest in it. He is en-
couraged by the approving atti-
tude of his professor, who feels
that he has done his part to sep-
arate the goats from the sheep.

The point of these two examples
is this: the way to arouse a stu-
dent’s inherent, if latent, intellec-
tual curiosity is through his vani-
ty. Make him think he is good, and
he will try to be better. Make him
think he is mediocre, and he will
not care.

An Axiom

Summarizing, I offer this gen-
eral axiom: If you take two stu-
dents, originally equal in intelli-
gence, curiosity, and will to work,
and if you reward one by giving
him an A and show indifference

Waitresses and Winos
Provide Unattractive

Town Environment

By TRACY HARRINGTON

Students are too critical of Lex-
ington.

I guess we're just accustomed to
calling it drab, and colorless, and
dull, and boring. But it really isn’t.
There’s lots to amuse in little old
Lexington.

Take the waitresses in the town
restaurants. Each place has its type,
like a fraternity.
One specializes in
hairy, obese crea-
tures with high
tempers and low
LQ.’s. Here Betty
Bovine scowls and
daily,
and may = snarl
with a little en-
couragement. She
also sports a ver-
min-infested head,
and she usually
manages to scatter a little dandruff
or a few lice over your pizza. (She's
even free of social niceties, and may
burp, seratch, sneeze or cough when
serving customers.)

If you tire of fat and ill-temper-
edness, you can travel out to one
of the less popular restaurants and
get a real kick. There the girls are
Vogue-oriented. Two of them—one
with carrot-red head and skin-tight
dresses—posture and pose, smile
slightly and greet you with an air
of real gentility. Of course you have
to overlook green teeth and dirty
fingernails, but with a little imagi-
nation you can see yourself in a
posh establishment.

No Monopoly

Restaurants don't have a monopoly
on Lexington's personality.

Red Square knows Baby Marijie
and Her Fouled Mouth Three, a
group of lower Lexington children
who please the boys with bawdy
tales and four-letter exclamations.

There are a number of other
young ladies, a little older than Mar-
jie, who circulate around North
Main and whose company can make
for a diverting evening.

If you're in the mood for meatier
entertainment, a towny joint can
provide a few laughs. On a vintage
Saturday night a student can wit-
ness three fights, a couple of major
injuries, and may even be able to
win himself a black eye or a broken
arm. I remember one occasion when
I had my fingernails trimmed—with
a meat cleaver, from across a room.

Square Dance

On Friday and Saturday nights,
the hill people emerge and converge
on Stevesville for the weekly dances.
Now this is the place for real fun.
A combination of blue grass music,
hair-lipped girls, and a strong flavor
of b.o. creates an atmosphere you
just cannot forget.

Nobody can say Lexington has no
color.

lt has more old maids, more winos,

more illiterates, more bums, and
less virgins than any town its
size in the world

And, unfortunately, for nine

months of the year it has us.

W&L Loses Eighth Straight,
Play D.C. Teachers Tonight

By GUY UNANGST

Jeff Twardy may replace 6-4 Bob
Spessard as pivot man in tonight’s
game with D.C. teachers, coach
Verne Canfield said yesterday.

According to Canfield, Twardy is
the one “real jumper” on the Wash-
ington and Lee team—and tonight
the Generals will need all the
“jump” they can get.

D.C. Teachers, led by high-scor-
ing guard Tony Upson, will be the
first all-colored team to play in
Doremus. It beat W&L before
Christmas in Washington, 97-79,
dominating the backboards and hit-
ting 60 per cent from the floor.

This could very well mark W&L’s
9th straight defeat. It lost Tuesday
to Lynchburg, 87-81, in a side ef-
fect of Wayne Proffit’s debut.

Proffitt, who just enrolled at
Lynchburg, hit 10 field goals and
17 of 22 free throws for 37 points,
played fine defense and received a
standing ovation when he fouled
out with 1:14 left.

 

W&L had come from a 15-point
deficit to tie the score, 72-72, with
4:55 left. Nine straight Lynchburg
points, seven on free throws, put
the game out of reach.

Lynchburg had led at the half,
46-32, despite Steve Sweitzer’s 18
points. Sweitzer finished with 27.

Canfield said his team was not
discouraged, although things aren't
likely to get brighter in the imme-
diate future. Monday the Generals
must play Pfeiffer, which upset
powerful Hampden-Sydney by 18
points. Hampden-Sydney has twice
beaten W&L by large margins.

Then tomorrow night the Gener-
als will travel to Richmond for an
eight o’clock game with RPI. Wé&L
could do alright in that one.

Long-range plans seem a _ bit
brighter. W&L has a chance to pick
up three transfer students, all of
whom played under Canfield at
Groverton High School in Alexan-
dria. Canfield is also after 65 po-
tential freshmen—three of whom
are All-Staters—whom he says meet

 

Ring-tum Phi Sports Staff Gives Awards
Name Canfield As “Optimist of the Year”

By R-TP Sports Staff |
There comes a time each year
when sports pages throughout the
country make their annual awards.
And that time is now upon us. Who)
are we to break with this worthy |
and assinine tradition?
Actually we're about a week late|
with these, but what’s a week, give |
or take a few months, to the Ring- |
tum Phi. So, leave us give out these
awards as voted by the interepid|
Friday Ring-tum Phi sports staff.
The first annual R-TP sports page |
award for the best example of
courage displayed during the pre-
ceding year goes to Oregon State.
Their fine example of courage in
showing up for the Rose Bowl
should stand as a model for us all. |
Technically, Oregon State should|
be considered ineligible since their |
action took place on January first)
of this year, but their worthiness
for this award was considered to)
be so great that the technicallity |
was overlooked.
The award for optimist of the year
strikes a little bit closer to home.
After much careful deliberation, the
R-TP sports staff decided to give
the award to Verne Canfield for)
accepting the job as basketball
coach at Washington and Lee.

It was much easier to decide who
deserved the good sportsmanship
of the year award. There can be but
one contender for this one, the New
York Yankees for their fine example

|

 

of good sportsmanship in firing Yogi
Berra for not winning the World
Series.

By an overwhelming vote , the
R-T Phi sports staff selected Sonny
Liston’s shoulder for the sports in-
jury of the year.

For the greatest display of hustle
in the sports world during this past
year, the R-TP has decided to give
Atlanta, Georgia, a special award...
the keys to the city of Milwaukee.

Without much discussion, it was
decided to give the award for most
needless sports event of the year
to the National Football League, for
its continuing presentation of the
Apathy Bowl between the also-rans.

The award for quickest strike-it-
rich deal in sports was this year
split two ways. To Joe Namath of
the University of Alabama and John
Huarte of Notre Dame, both of
whom are $400,000 properties of
the New York Jets (rhymes with
Mets).

It was a difficult choice to pick the
winner of the sports-organization of
the year award. Finally it was de-
cided to pick SPEPOOJCA for all
it has done for the Jennings Cup
competition.

And finally it comes time to pick
our candidate for Sportsman of the
Year. In recognition of their cour-
age in standing up to the abuses of
pro football clubs for signing play-
ers while they still have eligibility,
the award goes jointly to Pete Roe-
zell and Joe Foss. Vive le dollar’

 

Kell To Compete In Richmond As Winter Track Begins

By LUKE CROSLAND

Practice sessions for the Wash-
ington and Lee winter track team
have already begun and if exper-
ience means much, this should be a
good one. This year’s squad, accord-|
ing to coach Norm Lord, boasts sev-|
eral experienced runners as well as)
several promising freshmen. The
team's first meet is scheduled for
February 6 at the VMI relays.

One of the backbones of this year’s
squad is co-captain Chris Kell, a
letterman last year. Kell, incidentlly,
will get in some preliminary work
this weekend when he competes in
the Chesterfield J.C. meet in Rich-
mond.

Kell was the only W&L team
member to reveive an invitation to
compete in the invitational. He will
take part in the 50 yard dash

Although no other members of |
the team received invitations to the
meet, Coach Lord emphasized that
there are several other fine track-
sters on this year’s team capable
of fine performances
Kilpatrick Heads Distance Runners

 

Dave

Co-captain Andy Kilpatrick heads

|a strong group of distance and mid-

dle distance runners. Because of his
speed Kilpatrick may see some ac-
tion in the middle distances, al-
though as of now he is slated to
see action only in the distance runs.

Riff O'Connor and Charlie Head
also provide strength in the mile. In
the middle distance races (880 yards
and 500 yards), Bingham and Jim
Thompson will get a lot of work.
Meyers and John Graham
head the jumps (broad and triple)
and pole vault respectively

Frosh Look Good

Many promising freshmen will aid
this year’s team. George Parker, Bob
Stack, Williams and John Lawrence

Frosh In Sixth
Straight Loss
To Lynchburg

Washington and Lee’s freshmen
basketball team went down to its
sixth straight defeat without a vic-
tory Wednesday as it lost to the
Lynchburg College JV’s, 74-54.

The W&L frosh played Lynch-
burg on even terms for much of
the early part of the game, but
by the end of the first half had
fallen behind 38-26. Lynchburg
outscored the Brigaders 36-28 in the
final stanza to chalk up their vic-
tory.

Jim Madison led all scorers in
the game picking up 17 for W&L.
He was followed by Corbert Bryant
with 12 for W&L. Brown led Lynch-
burg scorers with 16. Coffee chipped
in with 13.

Freshman coach Joe Lyles re-
mains pessimistic on the season’s
outlook. He said, “It’s questionable
whether we'll win a game all year.”
He again pointed to the squad’s lack
of experience, with only three play-
ers having any previous high school
experience.

Lyles praised his players for their
determination and drive. He said,
“They realize they aren’t the best,
but they also realize someone’s got
to represent the freshman class.”
He added that there are some play-
ers in the freshman class who should
be out for basketball but aren’t for
various reasons.

The W&L frosh face their next
competition next Thursday night
when they play Bridgewater JV’s
there. Bridgewater already holds
one victory over W&L.

(Continued from page 2)

and beginning 5-6 years ago the
freshmen have been required to eat
in the Freshman Dining Hall, so it
is impossible to equate the decline
and fall of the W&lL male with the
fraternity in a way that is critical
of fraternities.

The actual fact is that the frater-
nity has considerably less effective
guidance, if you will—on the typi-
cal W&L student than in the past.
If anything, this situation calls for
the return of the fraternity system
to its former status. Strengthen the
fraternities and you'll “strengthen”
the W&L male! There is a decided
lack of guidance and control at W&L
because the administration has seen
fit to reduce the influence of the
fraternities.

In order not to think that W&L
types are unusual, however, you
have indicated that the knaves are
everywhere, even in Charlottesville.
They’ve all read “The Group”;
blame it on Vassar. Don’t blame it
on fraternities! At Harvard, where
NO fraternities confuse the egg-
heads, you'll recall the headlines
a couple of years ago about the
sexual activities during “visiting
hours” in the dormitories. They said
there were even some girls involved
too, but I doubt it.

So say what you want about
W&L knaves but don’t blame it
on fraternities which are already
having enough trouble with left-
ist faculty transfers from Kenyon,
Princeton, and Antioch as well as

the NAACP.
I suggest that you and each of

your readers write President Cole
of W&L and tell him that you be-
lieve that if all W&L fraternity
members and pledges were required
to eat and live in the fraternity
houses, there would be a return to
knighthood in Lexington.

Something is needed at W&L.
My opinion is that they should
return to the conditions where the
fraternities did exert more guid-
ance, control and education over
its members, particularly the
freshmen.

Let’s go Hollins...Promote the

This little thesis is addressed to
some of the professors here who are
notoriously hard graders (and many
more are than think they are). It
does not pretend to lay bare the
entire problem of apathy and low
grades, but it certainly points out a
significant aspect of them. You prob-
ably see no connection between the
interest shown by your students and
the grades you give. But the two

 

Rigid Grading Kills Incentive

are insoluably and directly linked;
intellectual interest varies directly
with grade level.

Some semester, why don’t you
experiment with giving more high
grades (A’s and B’s) and fewer
low ones, without necessarily reduc-
ing the work load, however. It cer-
tainly will not hurt you, and you
might drastically increase your effec-
tiveness as a teacher.

YOUR FAIR LADY has a way of turning into Cinderella-At-The-

Ball over the Christmas holidays. What with the stepped-up pace
of formal entertaining, parties, dinners, balls, and theater parties,
you, as Prince-Escort, will be called upon to look your elegant best.
In fact, quite aside from the Christmas season, your undergraduate
years will probably afford you more frequent opportunities to don

THREE TO GET READY for the big night. Three

popular styles in formal dinner jackets give
you a wide variety to choose from. The new,
flattering peaked lapel adds a distinctive note
to the traditional dinner jacket.

ets are lightweight, natural-shoulder, single-
breasted in all-worsted or worsted and mohair
combination, and are cut on straight-hanging
lines. Whatever your choice, the lapels should
be in either a dull or lustrous silk facing.

THE HONOR OF YOUR COMPANY requestea

on an engraved invitation implies a personal
obligation to look your absolute best. A vest,
worn in combination with the dinner jacket,
continues to be a more popular fashion trend.
Either the V-shaped with points, or the tradi-
tional straight-bottom styles are correct. One
of the newest trends in men’s formalwear is the
“modernized Edwardian” vest in straight cut
with dull satin facing on the lapels. Whatever
your choice of vest, it will echo your jacket in
color and lapel styles. Your matching black
trousers should be tapered.
