Don’t Miss It

CONTACT, less than a year ago only a dream, began this
afternoon at 2 p.m. when Dr. James W. Silver conducted a
seminar on “The Lack of Leadership in the Anti-Bellum
South.” This symposium stands as proof of one of the positive
goals for which Washington and Lee’s Interfraternity Council
can strive and, indirectly, as a worthwhile project of the cam-
pus’s fraternities.

It should be remembered, however, that the purpose of
CONTACT is not for the Interfraternity Council, the Uni-
versity, or CONTACT’s Steering Committee—they have al-
ready completed their task in bringing such a symposium to
our campus. The purpose of CONTACT Weekend was, and
still is, to provide the students of W&L with a program of an
intellectual nature and scope. In effect, CONTACT is an ex-
periment to see if our student body wants a program of this
nature.

The symposium itself has purposely been constructed so as
to include as wide a spectrum of student interest as is possible.
It has been quite successful in getting men like Dr. Silver,
Thomas G. Wicker, Colonel Francis Pickens Miller, Douglass
Cater, C. P. Ives and James R. Echols. Topics will vary from
the timely Civil Rights question facing the nation to questions
concerning how Europeans view American college students
traveling abroad.

The weekend will not be a dull, monotonous series of lec-
tures, but rather a series of talks made by men who are ex-
cellent speakers and who possess a real knowledge of their sub-
ject matter. Roundtable discussions will allow students to ask
questions concerning major issues.

Non-attendance will hurt no one, but yourself. An op-
portunity has been made available for our students and the stu-
dents of neighboring institutions to participate in a very worth-
while program. CONTACT is “an adventure into intellectual
exposure’—an adventure no member of our student body

should allow himself to miss. W.D.C.

Best Of Both Systems

From all indications a vote will be taken at Monday night's
Executive Committee meeting concerning the fate of campus
politics and the clique system at W&L. A report from a special
sub-committee now investigating the feasibility of a change
is expected at that time. The Friday Edition of the Ring-tum
Phi fully supports the new revision in the student government's
election process.

Although the exact wording of the proposal will not be
made public until Monday’s meeting, it is known that the
the report will contain the best features of Steve Smith’s pro-
posals: open primaries and elected political chairmen; and the
counter-proposal of EC member Rick Carrell. Basically, the
clique system will remain but only to facilitate the election
process and not to nominate candidates. Direct Primaries will
replace the old nominating process, eliminating “rule by the
clique.”

It is the hope of our paper that this proposal will meet
with the speedy approval of the Executive Committee, allow-
ing a referendum to be presented to the student body before
Spring elections. We feel that such a change is both needed

and necessary if our University is to enjoy the best student
leadership. W. D.C.

Robison Biel Revisited

In response to last week's editorial, the only defense that
we have heard for requiring the completion of a language
through the 201-202 level is that the majority of students do
this in one or two years. Dr. Linton L. Barrett, head of the
Romance Language department wrote: “there is no ‘three-
year language requirement’; it does not take eighteen hours to
graduate with a B.A. degree except for a minority.” If it exists
for a minority, how can you say that it does not exist? In statis-
tics provided for us by Dean Atwood's office, it is a three-year
language requirement for 26 per cent of this year’s freshman
class and 30 per cent of last year's. This percentage will become
smaller when part of this group applies for a B.S. degree, but
were it to exist as a three-year requirement for only | per cent
of the student body, we would still feel that we have a valid
criticism. The emphasis laid upon foreign language in the
courses which Washington and Lee prescribes for a liberal arts
education is excessive.

 

 

 

Since last week's editorial on this subject we have received

a number of letters correcting certain inaccuracies that ap-
peared in it. We gratefully acknowledge these and regret that
we were unable to correct them ourselves before we went to
press. In the responses which we have received, however, no
one has taken it upon themselves to defend the three-year
language requirement. If it is justifiable that a student be
forced to take eighteen hours in a course for which he might
neither have the aptitude nor interest, we would like to know
why.

We would also like to ask that the three-year language re-
quirement be taken into consideration by one of our present
Self-Study committees. While we are aware that a detailed
study of the curriculum was made only two years ago, we feel
that valuable improvements could be made in our program
for a liberal education, if a committee could take the time to
listen to student criticism of this requirement.

 

 

 

Students Decry Injustice
Of Overcut Consequences

Dear Dean Atwood,

Monday, Charles Milne, a fresh-
man Robert E. Lee Scholar, over-
cut his Religion class because of
circumstances which we feel were
beyond his control. He was stranded
in Washington with no money and
could not hitehhike back in time to
attend his class. Because of this he
will receive a grade of F in Religion,
a course in which he had not even
taken a test. Charles appealed his
case to a faculty committee but his
plea was denied on the grounds that
he could have borrowed money for
bus fare from local police or a travel
burea.

Just recently another freshman
overcut a class when he over-slept.
His appeal to his professor not to
fail him was successful. Charles’
professor was not in when Charles
went to see him. As was previously
stated, his appeal to the faculty com-
mittee was then denied.

We feel that Charles has been
wronged. In the first place it is
absurd to allow a man of Charles’
intelligence and ability only three
cuts per class. Most high schools
allow more absences than this. Is
a man’s work judged by his at-
tendance in class? If so, perhaps
many people who have failed out
of school but have attended all
their classes should be readmitted
and given A’s for perfect attend-
ance. Is a man any less intelligent,
has he gotten any less from a
course by making an A after not
attending his class than the man
whe made a C and did attend?

Furthermore, why ruin a student's

 

 

chances in a course because of an!
absence he couldn't help? A flagrant|

and intentional violation of the cut

system is one thing, but an auto-

is asinine.

(Editor's Note: The above letter,
addressed to Dean Atwood, is be-
ing circulated in petition form
among the student body, The peti-
tion, initiated by Dave Riley, has
already been signed by over three
hundred students since its birth
Wednesday night.

The Ring-tum Phi endorses the
petition and urges your support
if you believe the cause to be a
just one, Twenty petitions are in

that the consequences of overcut-
ting are unjust, please sign your

Columnist Analyzes Assimilation
Principles, Procedures, Codes

By JIMMY KIERSKY

Have you ever noticed an unusual
amount of ears outside of the Stu-
dent Union Building on Wednesday
nights? If you don’t know why they
are there, consider yourself fortu-
nate. The Assimilation Committee
holds their meetings then for the
purpose of disciplining those who
violate the assimilation rules.

It all starts out when some one
breaks one of these traditions or
rules. These traditions include con-
ventional dress, speaking, and walk-
ing on the grass (forbidden to fresh-
men only.) When one violates one of
these rules he is sometimes assimi-
lated.

The process of assimilating
someone is not very difficult, All
one does is fill out one of the as-
similation cards and place it in one
of the seven bexes around the
campus. Boxes are located in
Evans Dining Hall, Howe Hall, the
library, and Washington Hall, to
name a few. After the card is
turned in, the Assimilation Com-
mittee takes over.

The secretary of the Committee
collects the cards and he mails out
post cards requesting the violator
to appear before the Committee at
a certain time on some Wednesday

The students comes to the Stu-
dent Union Building. When he is
admitied to the room, he is con-
fronted by the nine members of
the Committee. They go over his
offense and he is asked if he denies
it. If he does and keeps the honor
system in mind, the offender is
let off. If he admits it, he is then
disciplined according to the deci-
sion of the Committee.

Most offenders are let off with
a warning that if they appear before
the Committee again they will have
to answer for both charges. Others
are fined one dollar if it is their
first offense. Those who are fined
are usually flagrant violators or in-
tentional violators.

The principal punishment is by
fine. Brooks Brown, chairman of the
Assimilation Committee, then turns
the money, obtained through fines,
over to the student Body Fund. The

Student Body Fund is handled by

the Executive Committee.

help every student orient himself to-
ward graduate school or the business
world. To find such a program as
this, one must consider the value and
need of introducing independent study
to the W&L academic program.

If W&L is to provide the quality
of education which would be suit-
able to a school of its caliber, it must
begin to foster a more intellectual
atmosphere. Such an atmosphere
can best be found in the college
where each student is given the op-
portunity to stand upon his own
ability to do independent research
in the subject which most attracts
his interest and curiosity.

A program of individual self-study
should be planned and carried out by
the student under the guidance of a
faculty member. The idea of inde-
pendent study is to allow the stu-
dent a program for cultivating a par-
ticular interest either in his major or
in another subject. That is, such a pro-
gram as this would give the student
an opportunity to become an expert
in a specific subject.

Such a program should not be de-
signed to take the place of a major
but rather to supplement the major.

study program becomes the means
by which one may help to satisfy a
particular intellectual curiosity and
at the same time prove his compe-

curriculum one step closer in bridg-
ing the gap between graduate and
undergraduate teaching methods.
How the program should be estab-
lished without taking time away from
the normal academic routine of the
student presents a problem. One solu-
tion is that independent study should
be begun in the freshman or sopho-
more year, whenever the student has
picked a subject on which he would
like to concentrate. For example, an
English major might pick the Ro-
mantic movement or even more spe-
cifically one writer during this peri-
od, as the subject matter for self

are all Honorable Men, we use it to |

The Honor System stands as a han-

helps to perpetuate the Big Lie of col-
lective honor and helps us avoid con-

AAUP Gives ‘B’ Rating;
Faculty Averages $10,452

$9,552. Washington and Lee pays pro-
fessors an average of $10,452. These
figures indicate that UVa. with an
average remuneration in the $10,500
to $10,999 bracket surpasses W&L as
the school with the highest compen-
sation scale in Virginia.

Washington and Lee compares
even less favorably with institutions
of like character, interests, and size.
Average faculty salaries at Amherst
range between $13,500 and $13,999;
Haverford and Wesleyan between
$12,000 and $13,000; and Sewanee and
Williams, between $11,000 and
$11,499. Davidson, Hamilton, Trinity,
Kenyon and Lehigh all rank below
W&L. Amherst pays the highest sal-
aries in the nation. Of the Southern
schools, Duke’s wage scale is number
one. The AAUP report further grades
only 13 of 76 Southern private in-
stitution in the “A” category, 50 in
the “B” bracket, and 13 in “C.”

Interestingly enough, instructors at
Washington and Lee receive bigger
relative salaries than professors of
higher standing. The AAUP gives
a grade “A” for instructors’ compen-
sation, “B” for assistant professors,
“B” for associate professors, and “B”
plus for full professors. Thus in-
structors here are paid as well as
anywhere in the nation.

The University has made advances
in this area of particular concern,
The 1962 AAUP report gave W&L
a “C” rating. The past two years have
seen in an increase of approximately
one thousand dollars in average fae-
ulty salaries. Yet further progress is
imperative if the University will
continue to attract men of outstand-
ing ability and purpose to strengthen
its academic offerings.

 

Chaplain Mustachely Visits
Lexington For First Time
To Get A Birdseye View

By BRUCE W. RIDER

One fine morning not long ago |
was trotting merrily, merrily down
one of our many nice little Washing-
ton and Lee walks
(Ah! Lexington in
springtime! Ah...).
I soon came upon
a small nervous
man who was in
_ the act of lurking

about our fair

campus.
} “Hello,” said I,
being a proud up-
holder of that Tra-
dition of Traditions,
Speaking. “Are
you looking for something, dear Sir?”

“Well, not exactly, young man. You

see, um, I'm Chaplain Mustachely
from Fallins College, and I was
_—

“Aha, Rey, Dr. Mr. Chaplain Mr.
Mustachely, Sir. Are you not the
very one who has been writing
those nasty articles in our Ring-
tum Phi about our nice fraterni-
ty men?”

“Oh, please don't take offense. I've
never been in Lexington before and
I just thought I'd take a quiet look
around.”

“Most certainly, Chaplain, Sir, Be
our guest.”

“Excuse me, kind student that you
are, but have you dated at Falling?”

“Yes, I have.”

“Did you ever, um, throw up on
our chapel?”

“Well, now that you ask, yes. It
was right after one of your sermons,
if I remember correctly.”

“Oh, I see.”

“Say, Mr. Chaplain, Sir, just why
are you wriling so many
about our fine students?”

“Well, you see, it’s the only place

articles

 

such as the fact that we are less in
quality than Harvard, Yale, Princeton-
and a host of other schools that we
could be comparable to. The system
promotes the heinous untruth that in-
| tellectuality is not the cardinal test
af a college's worth

We are repeatedly told that it is our |
Honer System that distinguishes us
| and that is a sad admission, if only we |
| realized it. The Honer System should
be a footnote te, an enhancement of,
/an added asset of, the Washington and
| Lee community. It rather, the
school’s main identifying feature, and
the only thing that separates it from
medioerity

The expulsion of a student for an
infraction of the rule should be met
with regret, compassion, and under-
standing. To some degree it is; but
there is a ritualized kind of horror
that accompanies such an expulsion
“How could he de

The point is that anvbody could
“do 1” in a given situation, in the
right (or, rather, wrong) frame of
mind. A convicted violator is net

rest of us. At most he is less for-

things about gross studenis and un-
gentlemanly behavior and they keep

Season With 60-58 Loss

Winter Trackmen Close
|

By JOHN GRAHAM

Friday Sports Writer
In its last contest of the winter
season, the W&L track team dropped
a 68-50 decision to Bridgewater Col-

lege last night at the VMI field
house.
The loss leaves the Generals at

1-2 for the indoor season, the lone
win coming last week against Roa-
noke College. The Maroons returned
last night for a meet with the W&L
freshmen, and prevailed 68-24,

The field events, usually a Gen-
eral strong point, proved the undoing
of the track men last night. Bridge-
water showed amazing strength, win-
ning every one of the five field
events, and piling up a 31-14 lead
going into the running contests.

The running events were fairly
evenly matched, with the visitors
holding a 37-36 point edge. All told,
the Generals won only four of the
14 events, and only their eight sec-
ond-place finishes kept things close.

On the positive side of the register,
the Generals won both of the relay

 

events. The quarter mile team of|
Chris Kell, Spencer Sullivan, Rob
Orr, and Bob Bigham won in the
time of :47.1. The mile realy team|
of Kell, Bigham, Rick Meiser and |
John Wiley, the latter two fresh- |
men, won their event with a 3:144
clocking the over 220 rubberized as-
phalt track.

Kell and Bigham also won the!
only two individual victories for the
Generals, Sprint-specialist Kell took
the 60-yard dash with a 6.6 clocking.
Bigham, out of action the end of
last season with a injured foot, cap-
tured the 600-yard run in 1:17.38.

Other than these two bright spots,
it was a sad night for the Generals.
Bridgewater placed two men in the
top three in six events, and swept
all three places in the high jump.

The outdoor season opens on
Thursday at the University of Rich-
mond at a meet billed as “polar bear”
by head coach Norm Lord. The Gen-
erals have one other meet, a contest
with Old Dominion on March 26, be-
fore spring vacation.

Tennis Prospects Look Good

By GUY UNANGST

Washington and Lee coach Verne
Canfield has the material to go from
an almost all-losing (2-17) season in
basketball to an almost all-winning
season in tennis.

Canfield has six returning letter-
men, a bevy of good freshmen and a
field of 35 to work with.

He’s been running his team since
practice began, and has only this week
sent them to the courts. Trouble is, he
hasn't enough room for them all to
play.

Top Three Players

Jim De Young, Randy Jones and
Lindsay Short, all seniors, are the
top three players. Other lettermen are
Fred Webb, Forest Dickinson and
Howard Busse.

 

Phil Thompson, who played No. 1)

on last year’s freshman team, also has
a chance to break into one of the six
singles spots.

The best of the freshmen are Buddy
Atkins, Steve and David Greenia,
Wieck Vellines and Pete Swart. Can-
field said there is a good chance some
or all of these will play on the var-
sity before the year is out.

The schedule includes six regular
season matches, the toughest of which

This will be W&L’s first time at

Defense, Size,

Depth Main

Baseball 'Team Problems

By LOCK HANDLEY

Defense is the key to W&L’s base-
ball fortunes this year, according to
coach Joe Lyles.

After three weeks of practice, most
of it indoors, Lyles expressed plea-
sure with the team’s hustle and held
out hope for substantial improvement
over last year’s 2-8-1 finish. The squad
is led by nine returning lettermen
and bolstered by the return of in-
fielder Eric Sisler, a .370 hitter his
freshman year.

Lyles’ main worries are lack of
depth and small size. With a team av-
eraging 5’ 9” and 160 pounds, the Gen-
erals will be unable to play for the
big inning and will have to rely on

pitching and infield defense to keep
opponent run totals down.

The horsehiders have two depen-
dable starters in senior Chris Wigert,
the staff's lone southpaw, and sopho-
more Pete Heumann. Lyles has high
hopes of freshman Bill Rasmussen as
a third starter. Others pitchers are
returning sophomores Jim Cooper,
Terry Herman, and Dick Masters.

Depth problems may hurt the Gen-
erals at first base as well. Tri-cap-
tain Skip Chase is the only man list-
ed at the position, although Jim Croth-
ers saw some action there last year.
The rest of the infield seems solid,
with Sisler at third, Dave Kirkpat-
rick (called by Lyles “our best ball-
players last year” at short, and either
letterman Mike Saunders or freshman
Larry Perrault as second. Ed Bishop

To Shoot For
Perfect Season

An unbeaten record will be within
reach of Washington and Lee’s golf
team for the first time in many years.

With six returning lettermen, all
consistently in the 70's, the team
should win all its dual meets and do
well in the Virginia Intercollegiate
Tournament and the College Athlet-
ic Conference Tournament, perhaps
winning both.

Last year’s team was 5-1 in dual
meets.

Ed Crosland, the captain, will play
No, 1. Other lettermen are Dick Drew,
Dave Carroll, Bob Duckwall, Roger
Sennott and Jeff Skarda. E. P. “Cy”
Twombly coaches the team.

Home matches will be played at

or Tribrook Country Club. The sched-

men, Skip Jacobsen, Guy Townley,
and Arnie Vedlitz, are also trying
for the spot.

In addition to their lack of depth
and small size, the horsehiders suffer
from a lack of lefthanded hitting, with
Allen, Chase, Crothers, and Wigert
(a fine hitting pitcher) the squad’s
only southpaws. On the credit side,
Lyles cites his core of experienced

| sophomores and the return to a full

practice schedule of Wigert and Al-
len.

After an intrasquad game and possi-
ble scrimmage with VMI, the Gen-
erals will first see action in a scrim-
mage with New Haven College here
on March 22, at 3:15. The regular
season opens March 27, against Elon
College.

Prospects for the Elon game are not
too good, according to Lyles. The Car-
olinians have enjoyed better practice
weather all spring, and will have five
games under their belt when they face
W&L.

On Sunday afternoon C. P. Ives,

Sunday night, Col. Francis P. Mil-

study.

The next step would be to set up
a program under the supervision of
a faculty member from the English
department—a program which would
call for two, three, or more hours
of work every week outside of the
classroom. The student need only
spend that amount of time which he
could well afford to take away from
his normal study routine.

Such a program begun in the
sophomore year should give great
satisfaction to the student who pur-
sues it for two or three years. The
program should be dropped any
time the student loses interest in his
subject. For that matter a student
should have the freedom to begin
the program whenever he chooses,
even as late as his junior or senior
year. If the student’s independent
study is of sufficient quality, it is
possible that the head of the de-
partment in which the student is a
major may allow him to replace one
or two subjects of his major with
additional time for research and in-
dependent study. Of course, the stu-
dent must produce results,

One may ask if W&L doesn’t have

honor programs to carry out the pur-
pose of self-study. Yet only a small
percentage of the student body qual-
ify for research scholarships and hon-
or programs (limited to the senior
class). An independent study program
gives to the average and good stu-
dent an opportunity and encourage-
ment to achieve individual accom-
plishment in a specific academic sub-
ject.

It would appear that such a pro-
gram might help to increase the in-
itiative of students to tackle academ-
ic problems which have not yet been
solved or exhausted by their teach-
ers. A program of independent study
also increases the intellectual curi-

osity, independent research, and the
academic excellence of those stu-
dents who participate in it. Still an-
other benefit of such a program
would be a closer association be-
tween student and teacher in plan-
ning the program and evaluating its
results.

Above all, a program of indepen-
dent study would help the individ-
ual gain confidence in his ability to
do academic work on a graduate lev-
el, or at least point him toward the
graduate method of teaching.
