New Agency

For Combos

MayBeHired

In an effort to provide higher
caliber bands for lower prices at
fraternity combo parties, IFC So-
cial Chairman Ed Allen has tenta-
tively made plans for an additional
agent to handle bookings.

All contracts except for local town
groups are presently arranged by
Ted Hall, as they have been for
some time now. His service handles
such groups as Maurice Williams, the
Delacardos, and the Chevies. Ac-
cording to Allen, however, many
houses have recently complained
of his comparatively higher prices
and poor service. In addition, Ted
Hall has allegedly often charged dif-
ferent houses for the same band.

Allen says these complaints are
not new and began last year. To try
to curb this, he contacted Spotlight
Attractions of Richmond. This agen-
cy is the Southern representative
of a New York booker and has avail-
able many of the big name bands not
possible for oridnary combo week-
ends.

Their rates are comparatively low-
er than those of Ted Hall and special
prices are given if the same band
is contracted for more than one
weekend appearance.

By placing these two agencies in
competition against one another,
W&L should be able to secure bet-
ter bands of a greater variety at
lower prices and in a more efficient
business attitude.

A student committee would be set
up to deal with the agencies in
contracting various bands, thus eli-
minating individual contact with
them. Allen emphasized that this
would also provide a greater cen-
tral organization in addition to the
tangible benefits.

Outcome of a meeting held this
afternoon with the two agencies
will be announced sometime next
week.

 

 

 

Alumni House
Is Approved

By Trustees

By STEVE SAUNDERS

The home of the late Dr. Fitz-
gerald Flournoy, formerly Profes-
sor of English has been approved as
the Washington and Lee Alumni
House by action of the Alumni-
ni Board of Trustees this past
weekend. According to Mr. William
Washburn, Executive Secretary of
the Alumni Association, each board
member was given a set of the pre-
liminary plans for renovating the
Flournoy home on which to suggest
revisions, which must be returned
by next Saturday.

New plans will then be drawn up
by the University architects, Clark,
Nexsen and Owen of Lynchburg,
incorporating the suggested revi-
sions. “If the cost of renovation has
not become infeasible at that point,”
said Mr. Washburn, “then the con-
tract for the construction will be let.”

Features included in the prelimi-
nary plans include the addition of
porches on three sides of the Flour-
nory home to accommodate heavy
crowds, and two large reception
rooms on the first floor, flanking a
sizeable foyer. Alumni offices will
have to be located upstairs, These fa-
cilities will include space for the
addressograph and other heavy
working machines, an alumni board
room, alumni lounge. and a new ol-
fice for the Executive Secretary.

The current plans will result in
an almost entirely new interior
Floor boards will be replaced, as will
the wall plaster. A new heating
plant and air conditioning unit will
be installed

This is the first Alumni House
Washington and Lee University has
had. For many years, the alumni
office was located in an old building
located on the present site of the
Student Union. When that structure
was demolished to make way for
the Student Union, the alumni office
moved to its present quarters im
Washington Hall

Other business considered at the
Board meeting this weekend
was the publication of the Alumni
directory. Mr. Washburn said that
the directory will be ready for dis-
tribution sometime in January 1965
it has been in preparation since last

June

Major Letcher of VMI (2nd from left) answers a question raised by the
audience in Monday night’s panel discussion on the results of the Presi-

Davidson, Letcher, Dr. Charles Philips, and Dr. Edward L. Pinney,

Political Experts Analyze Election;
Results, Future Discussed By Panel

An Analysis of the 1964 Elections!
was the topic of the round table

discussion sponsored by Pi Sigma
Alpha, the national political sci-
ence fraternity. last Wednesday at
7:30 p.m. in duPont Hall.

Dr. C. F. Phillips and Dr. E. L.
Pinney of the W&L political science
department, Maj. Campbell, profes-
sor of history at VMI, and Mr. C.
Davidson, county Democrat spoks-
man, presented their views on the
quality of the campaign and likely
trends for 1968.

Much of the discussion centered
around the future of the Republican
Party. Mr. Davidson foresaw an up-
hill climb for the GOP for several
years to come unless some unusual
national disaster, such as a depres-
sion, occurs.

Dr. Phillips, calling the moderate
Republican losses on the local level
“the greatest tragedies of the cam-
paign,” said, “The party is not dead
in any sense of the word. But it is
hurt. The problem now is to fight
and rebuild for the future.

Dr. Pinney added that moderate
Republicans would now demand and
win back control of the party to its
former leaders. Maj. Campbell
agreed: A party that can win 36 per
cent of the vote is not dead.”

Following the formal discussion,
an informal question and answer
period took place.

Oceanographer Pratt
Speaks To Geologists

Dr. Richard Pratt of the Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institute spoke
here today on the nature of the
ocean floor off the Atlantic Coast and
the major trends of oceanography
in today’s scientific world.

Invited here as a guest of the
Geology Department, Dr. Pratt told
listeners at an 11:10 a.m. lecture
about the varied features to be found
on the ocean floor. An area imme-
diately off the North American
eoastcoast, Dr. Pratt explained, is a
submerged portion of the continent
which was flooded at the close of the

last ice age due to the melting
of the ice sheets.
The sea floor is further dotted

with large canyons and submarine
voleanoes. Exploration and mapping

bered for his portrayal of the Em-
peror in last spring’s Dr. Faustus,
interprets the title role of Antonio,
the merchant of Venice. Antonio is
a man of wealth, but also of gen-
erosity; a character of princely dis-
position, “,,.an unwearied spirit in
the doing of courtesies.”

Shylock, the embittered usurer
who by his malice almost destroys
Antonio, is portrayed by Lew Davis.
The role is a change for Davis, who
has made most of his Troubadour
appearances in comic roles.

Charlie Bright, the president of
the Troubadours, plays Bassanio,
the irresponsible, handsome young
friend of Antonio, whose need for
money almost leads to disaster. Play-
ing opposite Bright will be Mrs. Mar-
tha Evans, the wife of Dr. John
Evans of the W&L English depart-
ment. She will make her debut with
the Troubs as Portia, the wealthy,
witty, intelligent heiress whose love
Bassanio wins.

Nerissa, Portia’s maid and confi-
dante, is portrayed by Kendall Jam-
ison, a senior at Lexington High and
a veteran Troubadour actress.

Mare Rehr, who won the Troub
freshman award last year for his
performance in Androcles and the
Lion, plays Gratiano, the talkative
and mercurical companion of Bas-
sanio.

Jan Parham acts the part of Shy-
lock’s daughter Jessica, a free spirit
who finds life in her father’s austere
household a tedious hell.. Launcelot
Gobbo, the omnipresent Elizabethian
fool, is played by Lock Handley, an
experienced actor in low comic roles
at W&L.

Not to be overlooked is Tubal,
Shylock’s friend, who is played by
the impossible to overlook Dr. Keith
Shillington, making his annual ap-
pearance on the Troubadour stage.

Dr. Cecil Jones, the director and
advisor of the Trowbadours, had an
especially large job to do in this
show, as Shakespeare's plays have
few explicit stage directions; but
with Dr. Jones’ past record, full
confidence may be placed in the
success of the production. Special

Troubs Open Season Wednesday
Presenting “Merchant of Venice’

Continuing the celebration of the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare and Christo-
pher Marlowe, the Troubadours will present Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice as their next
production. The show will be given Wednesday through Saturday of next week at the Trouba-
dour Theatre. Curtain time each night will be at 8:15.

This comedy, though it borders on tragedy until the last act, is one of the merriest of
Shakespear's comedies. It will be presented by a corps of veterans of the Troubadour stage.

 

ing who designed the sets for this
show.

The drama begins when Bassanio
asks Antonio for money to aid him
in his wooing of Portia. Antonio,
ever ready to help his friends, bor-
rows the money from Shylock des-
pite Shylock’s seemingly playful de-
mand for a pound of Antonio’s flesh
should he be unable to repay the
loan.

Bassanio’s wooing succeeds, but
Antonio’s business ventures fail un-
expectedly and Shylock goes to

 

court to demand his pound of flesh.
But Portia, disguised as a lawyer,
arrives in time to save the day.
Shylock is left broken and defeated
while the others end the play in a
round of joking, merrymaking, and
weddings. Thus a cheerful and spirit-
ed finale closes this often tensely
dramatic comedy.

Tickets for the show will be avail-
able at the door. But season ticket
holders as well as others wishing
to see the play should call HO 3-2181,
extension 273, for reservations.

 

Tutoring Program Reestablished
Under UCA, Hodges’ Direction

The University Christian Associa-
tion is continuing a tutoring service
begun last year. The UCA, under
the guidance of Dr. Louis Hodges,
has compiled a list of tutors available
to W&L students and has set up the
program in the same way as it was
handled last year.

Each year, Dr. Hodges explains,
many students who are obviously
able to do well in their courses fail
for reasons other than lack of abil-
ity. The UCA in an attempt to
curb these failures had made up
the list of tutors who are willing to
help students with academic prob-
lems at no cost.

From the faculty, the Association
acquired a list of students who, in
the opinion of the appropriate pro-
fessors, were able to give help in
a specific subject.

From this list the UCA selected
a number of students who were then
contacted and asked if they cared
to volunteer their services. The
names of the students who replied
affirmatively were then placed on a
list which was mimeographed and
given to freshmen, faculty advisors,
fraternity presidents, and the deans
of the various schools.

Dr. Hodges has pointed out that
the tutors are not only useful to
the failing students, but also to the
student who, although his grades are
not extremely low, feels that they
are definitely below what they
should be, and is willing to work for
the grades he desires.

The tutors are free to withhold
such services from those students
who rely too heavily upon the tutor,
those who seem not to benefit aca-
demically, or those who do not ap-
ply themselves during the tutoring
sessions.

The list of tutors and their re-
spective subjects are as follows:

Biology: Chip Roadman, Charles
Myers.

Chemistry: John Neergaard, Phil
Manor

English: Shannon Jung, Fred Min-
del.

French:
Davis.

Tony Outhwaithe, Tom

 

Geology: Chip Roadman, John
Clegg.
German: Kirk Follo, John C.

Moore, Mel Lapes.
Greek: Jim Steen, Mike Saunders.
History: Gus DuBus, Craig Cotton.
Latin: Scott Snowden, Joe Seay.
Mathematics: Chris Kell.
Philosophy: Sam Ansell,
Vaughn.
Physics: Jim Legg, David Broad-
dus.
Spanish: Sam Ansell, Richard Riv-
era.

Kiwanians Plan
Operetta Here

The Lexington Kiwanis Club is
planning to present another Gilbert
and Sullivan operetta this year.
Presentation of “Iolanthe” this spring
has been proposed, consisting of an
entirely local cast as did last year’s
production “H.MS. Pinafore.”

Those people who worked on
“Pinafore” last year—Lexingtonians,
county residents, W&L students and
faculty, and VMI cadets and faculty
—constitute an immediate working
group. However, new support is
both needed and welcomed. No pre-
vious singing experience is neces-
sary rather the emphasis is on en-
thusiasm.

Interested W&L students may see
Professor David B. Dickens in du-
Pont 209 (Ext. 237) for further infor-
mation.

Poet Miller Williams will be the
next guest in the series of lectures

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi
Friday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

What Has Happened?

It is an embarrassing fact but so far this year there has been
a discipline problem at the weekly IFC meetings. The pre-
vailing attitude has been one of complete indifference. The
supposedly responsible students elected to be representatives
to the IFC have attempted to make a travesty of the whole af-
fair, and what has been accomplished has been solely through

the hard work of the IFC’s leaders.

The attitude prevalent at the weekly meetings resulted
first in what came to be an IFC “humor column” in the Tues-
day paper and last Monday night resulted in a lecture to the
IFC membership which one might expect to receive as a soph-
omore in high school but never as a supposed leader in a
school of leaders. Last Monday’s lecture was given by Dean
Atwood. He was apparently as embarrased to give it as the
IFC was to hear it. It came though as the inevitable result of
numerous inexcusable acts of immaturity on the part of mem-
bers of the IFC and the fraternities which they represent.

The events last Monday night are disturbing in the light
of the prestige which the IFC had at the end of last year.
Tt was a long hard climb, but, by the end of last year, the IFC
had become the second most respected body on campus. It
stood second only to the Executive Committee. This was true
not only from the stand point of the students who, like it or
not found themselves more under the power of the IFC, but
also from the point of view of the administration who had so
much confidence in the IFC that they returned to it the long
lost power of judicial control over fraternities. The changes
that took place last year were monumental in the light of gen-
eral decline of administrative support for fraternities across
the country.

Art Broadus, last year’s president of the IFC, held one of
the most respected positions on campus, and it was primarily
for his work in the IFC that he won the Gilliam Award for
most outstanding senior. He won over such competitors as Bill

Noell who was President of the Student Body.

Because of the prominence and prestige which was at-
tributed to the IFC and its leaders last year, we might well ask,
“What has happened?” What has happened when Dean At-
wood finds it necessary to lecture the IFC for its conduct?
What has happened when each week we have to read a comical
report of the IFC meetings which is unfortunately justified?
What has happened when seven fraternities choose not to show
up for the IFC faculty banquet? What has happened when six
fraternities put up home coming displays which embarrass
the University before townspeople and alumni in direct de-
fiance to pleas from the Alumni Secretary and the Student
Body President? What has happened when twelve fraternities
fail to comply with an order from the Board of Trustees that
they turn in monthly financial statements?

 

We might wonder also what is going to happen, for the
respect which the fraternities have gained over the past few
years in the eyes of the faculty is presently being lost. Dean
Atwood made this explicitly clear.

We of the Friday staff do not wish to point any fingers,
because it would be hypocritical of us to do so. We only ask
the questions, “What has happened?” and “What is going to
happen?”, knowing that the answers are fairly obvious, and
if, after another five or six years, we find that the adminis.
tration has complete control over fraternities on this campus,

we might well ask a third question, “Can we blame them?”

 

Wanted: Student Expression

Throughout the literature that has been written in support
of segregation, we notice one very pertinent characteristic:
It seems that no one has yet made a valid case, supported by
rational and intelligent reasoning, for retaining the nine-
teenth century institution of segregation. This leads us to
wonder if such a case can be made.

Apparently there is some sentiment on this campus which
does support the continuation of this institution. If such a
case can be made by a student or faculty member on this
campus, the Ring-tum Phi would welcome the opportunity of
presenting it to the student body for their critical examina-
tion. If not, we must continue to maintain our opinion that
integration is not only the intelligent, but truly the inevitable,
way of life in the twentieth century.

We challenge those of you who feel otherwise to show
valid reasons backing your opinion. If you do not pick up this
challenge, we must assume that you can’t, with any intellec.
tual integrity, maintain your present stand.

Since the Ring-tum Phi is a vehicle for student expression,
we would extend a welcome to any student who would like to
write either a humor column or some other form of creative
writing for publication. Mail should be addressed to Box 899,
Lexington, or brought to the print shop or to one of the staff
members.

Because we believe that student creative talent should have
a medium through which it can be heard, and because we feel
that the Ring-tum Phi can offer a place (if not a nadequate
one) for such talent, we encourage any students who have
written in the past, or who have now started to write, to sub-
their work,

Political Horizons

 

By BILL BURKE
Political Columnist

That the Republican Party was
defeated is perhaps the understate-
ment of the decade. It was a mam-
mouth Waterloo. The dubiety of the
election results while unpleasant are
nevertheless naked reality. Political-
ly spaking, let’s examine what hap-
pened.

At the outset the GOP was a di-
vided party. Governor Rockfeller
and Ambassador Lodge walked out
of the convention when Goldwater
was nominated. They never re-
turned to the fold. This is not to
say Goldwater would have won with
their support but it is beyond all dis-
pute that Goldwater would have
made a respectable showing if he had
received the 2 to 3 million votes
that they could have delivered.

When the split is added to the
circustances surrounding the LBJ
Millennium, we can understand this
setback. Johnson and the White
House were united in their nuptial
knot as a result of the deplorable
assassination and this elopement was
accommodated by the nostalgic wave
that follows such an event; the pow-

ers of the President are always
helpful and it is interesting to note
that the federal government spent
tax money in a “non partisan” effort
to register voters in Harlem—there
was also a similar “non Partisan”
effort in Rockbridge County to get
out the vote initiated by several
W&L professors; the Communists
averted their attention from the free
world to accomplish the overthrow
of Khrushchev and attempted to
mend ideological differences and the
economy was in an intoxicated hap-
piness. The Messiah was handed his
crown.
Was Conservatism Rejected

There are animated frogs among
us who have crawled upon their
dumbwaiters shrieking that conser-
vatism is dead. They have even of-
fered to pay our burial expenses.
No, thank you. If anyone really be-
lieves that, then our opposition is
not as bright as we had supposed.
For those Conservatives who are dis-
comforted, they have every right to
be, but an examination of history
might be helpful. The party now in
in England lost by a margin greater

 

than Goldwater’s only five year’s

An Informed Warning

There is a new species of carnivore in the Lexington area. We print

this as a warning to all students. This new species is a peculiarly obnox-
ious sort. He is crafty, merciless, and cruel. He roams about both day and
night attacking his victims with no warning. (At least the rattlesnake
lets you know he’s about to strike.) There is only one defense that has
proved effective against this merciless breed and that is to not carry
cigarettes. Unfortunately, though, such practices have only seemed to
increase the numbers of this species now commonly known as Buttus
bummerus.

pictured as a warmonger, racist, fac-
iast, and a danger to society. The
primary issue in the campaign should
have been whether we should have
more or less government and the ne-
cessity for a definite foreign policy,
but this was never suffused to the
American voter. The major elements
of Conservatism are based upon
sound economic policies and an at-
tempt at success in foreign affairs.
That is to say we do not believe in
spending two dollars if we only have
one. Nor do we believe that the loss
of 800 million people to Communism
in the last 20 years constitutes suc-
cess.

The Future

The Republican Party must broad-
en its base. In the minds of those
who oppose us, they suppose the
G.O.P. is a private club for the
elite. Indeed, our membership was
exclusive on November 3. But this
notion could not be further from
the truth.

We must continue the educational
process just recently begun. The bat-

 

Burke Explains Defeat, Predicts GOP Future

tle ultimately will be won or lost
on the validity of our ideas, not on
the ability of Liberals to distort our
candidates. Conservatives must en-
ter the fields of education, religion,
and journalism. The Liberals have
been doing it for years.

The Republican party must estab-
lish a nucleus of professional politi-
cians. This is evident from the last
three campaigns. Nixon established
his own group of workers in his
two ventures leaving the Republi-
can National Committee void of
power and Goldwater appointed his
own people within the National
Committee. This was necessary in all
three instances because the National
Committee was disorganized and
unused. This professional nucleus
is exactly what is now being estab-
lished in Washington. And whether
a candidate be a moderate or a con-
servative, they shall run the future
campaigns.

Senator Goldwater’s future poses
several alternatives. He can retire
from politics, regroup and strive for
the 1968 nomination, or remain as a
constructive, active force within the
party but not its head. The third
alternative is the most probable.
Senator Goldwater will remain the
head of a large, conservative portion
of the Republican Party. In this role
he will run for Carl Hayden’s seat
and be returned to the Senate.

 

‘Fail-Safe’ Considers Problem
Of Ending Accidental Warfare

By JAMES JENNINGS
Cinema Columnist

Most major movie critics have
amused themselves recently by ridi-
culing “Fail-Safe” on the grounds
that the whole thing is absurd from
the acting to the plot. I am glad
that these critics of such percep--
tion spend their time misinterpreting
movies and not international poli-
tics. “Fail-Safe” is not a good movie
from the standpoint of symbolic,
sociological overtones, and maybe
even acting, but it does present a
situation which one cannot shrug
off as one would “The Day the
Earth Caught Fire.” Admittedly,
after laughing through “Dr. Strange-
love,” one is reluctant to take the
drama and rash statements of “Fail-
Safe” seriously.

‘Tempted to Laugh’

In the tradition of “Strangelove,”
one wold be tempted to laugh at the
political scientist, who presents a
point of view that is being seriously
considered. One wants to laugh at
some of the dialogue between the
President and the Soviet Premier,
but one wrong word or slight mis-
understanding could end such a con-
versation. The irony of some of
the statements leaves the viewer with
no choice but to laugh, and some
of the irony leaves the viewer with
a funny feeling in his stomach.

The situation in “Fail-Safe” is one
to be considered. Miscalculation
could very easily trigger a nuclear
war or even a power failure might.
The movie intends to show us that
we have outdone ourselves in our
military development, but now we
have to live with this development
and find some way to utilize it with-
out destroying the world. If it means
we must sacrifice a city to preserve
ourselves and the rest of the world,
then it must be done according to
“Fail-Safe.”

Many Ways

There are many ways for a nu-
clear war to start and there have
been many books and movies deal-
ing with the problem of total war.
“Fail-Safe” is one way to start and
maybe stop war. “On the Beach”
is another and is just as probable in
the future. The movie makers have
taken it upon themselves to exploit
the possibilities in a situation that
is frightning, frustrating and fasci-

 

nating. So far, most of these movies
have been good and have provoked
needed thought in people. “Fail-
Safe” is a success because it makes
me think about what man has done
and what machins in the hands of
man can do to man.

Students Dress
Part OF W&L

By WARREN MONTGOMERY
Feature Editor

The approaching referendum on
the future powers of the Assimilation
Committee will pose to each stu-
dent this question—What does con-
ventional dress mean to you?

To answer this question, let us
ask another—What Makes Wash-
ington and Lee a distinctive univer-
sity? What is the difference be-
tween it and most colleges? The
difference cannot be stated in one
sentence or even in concrete terms.
Washington and Lee has a certain
atmosphere about it—a feeling of
past generations and present aca-
demic excellence, of honor, tradition,
and the aristocratic ideal.

How can one contemplate the
University without a sense of awe
and smallness in the presence of a
thing greater than himself? Regard
the beautiful Washington Hall group.
George Washington built it, Gen-
eral Lee once walked under these
very columns. Fifty yards down the
hill, in the Chapel, lies the body of
Lee himself—probably one of the
most noble, honorable, brave, and
just men who ever lived.

Precious few universities have
this sort of atmosphere, an atmos-
phere capable of inspiring men to-
ward high ideals and excellence of
character. How should this excel-
lence manifest itself in Washing-
ton and Lee students? It should
give them a certain sense of per-
sonal dignity as the heirs and per-
petuators of two centuries of great-
ness.

Conventional dress is certainly not
not the vital cornerstone of W&L
spirit. It is , however, a substantial
support of it, for conventional dress
enhances the personal dignity of
each student who wears it. How?

UVa. Booters Top W&L;
Blame 3-1 Loss on Timing

By LOCK HANDLEY

W&L’s tournament-bound soccer team dropped its second
decision against seven victories Tuesday, losing to Virginia,

3-1.

Ball control was the General booters’ main problem as the
Wahoos put the pressure on and kept it there. W&L’s fine rear

guard prevented any scoring until 93 15 of the second quarter,
when Bill Forrester boomed a shot*—————

in from ten feet out to put the
Cavaliers in front.

The Generals meanwhile were un-
able to mount a consistent attack,
as UVa.’s outstanding goalie Billy
Ray kept turning occasional bril-
liant plays by Brad Shinkle and Tim
Henry into near misses.

The third quarter saw more of
the same. Ken Harvey got the Wa-
hoos their second score as he nudged
in a cross from Forrester with
eight minutes gone. W&L coach Joe
Lyles immediately pulled out most
of his first-string line; but the sec-
ond team had no better luck con-
taining the red-hot Cavaliers.

Harvey got his second goal of
the day, on a fine shot which angled
sharply over the head of sub goalie

 

Despite his injury Coach
praised Shinkle’s play,
that of Henry and the outstanding
fullback corps of Dave Redmond,
Pete Preston, and Howard Busse.
And he said that he thinks his boot-
ers are actually better than either
UVa. or American U., who de-
feated the Generals earlier.

The loss dropped W&L to second
seeding behind UVa. for the VISA
tournament. Both teams have iden-
tical records of 4-1 in state compe-
tition, but the Wahoos drew top
billing on more goals scored. The
Generals retain their first-round
bye, though, and will play for the
first time tomorrow afternoon when
they meet the winner of today’s
game between Randolph-Macon and

Harriers, Frosh Football

Play Here Tomorrow

Washington and Lee’s freshman
football team wil be at home tomor-
row as the Brigadiers try for their
first victory of the season in a 2:30
game against Randoph-Macon’s
freshmen at Wilson Field.

Th Baby Generals go into this
game with a record of no wins, four
losses and one tie. W&L lost their
last game to Fork Union Military
Academy, 20-0. This will be W&L’s
last game of the season.

The varsity cross-country team
will be looking for their sixth vic-
tory of the season against one loss
when they face the harriers of Fair-
mont College tomorrow at 3:30 on
the W&L course.

Last week the General harriers
took third place in the state cross-
country meet at the VMI course.
W&L was third with 97 points be-
hind winning William and Mary with
23 and VMI with 33. The Generals
did avenge their only loss of the
season to Bridgewater by finishing
ahead of the Eagles who came in
fifth with 137 points behind Old
Dominion who had 116.

Generals Play

Southwestern

In CAC Game

By JOHNNY GRAHAM

The Washington and Lee football
team is back in the running for
the College Athletic Conference
football championship.

Last Saturday’s 11-6 upset of
CAC frontrunner Sewanee installed
the Generals as a definite title pos-
sibility. With two CAC games re-
maining, wins in both will assure the
Generals of at least a tie for the
championship.

The chances for sole possession
of the top spot are slim according
to General coach Lee McLaughlin.
These chances hinge upon a tie in
the Washington-Sewanee game this
Saturday and General wins in the
next two games.

Washington presently leads the
standings with a 2-0 mark followed
by Sewanee with a 2-1 record. The
Generals have lost to Centre and
beaten Sewanee for a 1-1 mark and
third place.

Tomorrow’s game with southwest-
ern of Memphis is a must game in
the title race. The Lynx are 1-2 in
conference competition, having lost
to Washington and Sewanee. Mc-

Montgomery Discusses Basis Of Conventional Dress

In most parts of the country, to

only the students can preserve

So long as Washington and Lee stu-

really, a good night’s sleep is bet-

So it’s off to bed. But the alarm is

8:25 and three hours of study should
do the trick. The alarm goes off at
five. It is reset to six. Then to seven,
