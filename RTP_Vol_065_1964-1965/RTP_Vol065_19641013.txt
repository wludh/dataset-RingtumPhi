Liberty Party
Names Kline
For Frosh EC

Jody Kline, a Phi Kappa Sigma |

pledge from Sault St. Marie, Mich.,

was nominated Sunday by the Liber- |

ty Party for the post of Executive
Committeeman representative from
the freshman class.

The Liberty Party candidate was
named by the political representa-
tives from the ten member houses
of the party at a meeting held at
the Phi Phi house. This nomination
marks the first venture into campus
politics by the Liberty Party since
its formation last spring.

Chairman Patton Adams stated

STATEMENT FROM PATTON
ADAMS, CHAIRMAN OF LIBER-
TY PARTY:

The Liberty Party has selected a
candidate worthy in every respect
to be the freshman Executive Com-
mittee representative. No compro-
mise was effected in his selection;
no appeasement was granted to
anyone; no favor was shown toward
any house. He was chosen on his
personal merits alone.

I wish to state at the outset of
this campaign that the Libery Par-
ty stands United and unrelenting
behind Jody Kline for this office.
As he goes forward to win, he will
wholeheartedly represent his Party,
but he will also represent himself—
his own qualifications, his own cap-
abilities, and his own _ initiative.
I encourage every freshman to meet
and get to know Jody, to learn
his views and, if necessary, to ques-
tion, them, and in the end to support
him for this high position.

Finally, let everyone—freshman or
senior alike—know that in every
election in the coming years this
Party will stand firm on the princi-
ple of competent, qualified candi-
dates; and will take no part in se-
lecting nominees through “double-
dealing, conniving, and underhand-
edness,” as one disgruntled, hereto-
fore active party man, and unsuc-
cessful office-seeker of last year re-
cently described campus politics. It
will be our continued desire to put
before this student body the best
men our Party has to offer.

 

dacy was clearly the choice of the
party. In addition it was noted that
Kline had already received a sub-
stantial endorsement in the freshman
class poll sponsored by the R-t P.

W-L Conducts
A Self Analysis

By FRANK FAIRCHILD, JR.
As a member of the Southern As-
sociation of Colleges and Schools,
Washington and Lee is currently un-
dertaking a Self-Study Program.
Requiring its members to initiate
such a program every ten years,
the Association encourages the par-
ticipating colleges to improve their
educational effectiveness by review-
ing their goals, measuring their suc-
cess in achieving them, and seeking
new methods of promoting efficiency.
President Cole has appointed a
Self-Study Committee headed by Dr.
William Hinton to conduct the study.
Other members of the committe are
Deans Light, Pusey, Atwood, and
Adams, Professors Gilreath and
Jenks, and Mr. Frank Parsons.

Dr. H. Lawrence Wilsey of the
management consultant firm of
Booze, Allen & Hamilton in Chicago
will serve in an advisory capacity
to the faculty committee.

Having assisted numerous other
colleges in their long-range plan-
ning programs, Dr. Wilsey will of-
fer suggestions concerning the most
effective procedural methods that
can be used in the study.

Dr. Wilsey’s appointment is in ac-
cord with President Cole’s stated
desire to eliminate as many of the
mechanical aspects of the Self-Study
Program as possible.

It has been the experience of the
University in the past that some
phases of the program restrict the
time of both the members of the
faculty and of the administration.
President Cole hopes that Dr. Wil-
sey and the faculty committee will
be able to alleviate this problem.

Kline Wins R-tP

EC Primary Poll;

_ Matthews Next

Final figures in the Ring-tum Phi
freshman EC primary poll gave
Phi Kap pledge Jody Kline a com-

fortable victory over Joe Matthews

and Steve Saunders, who finished

_ second and third respectively.

Kline was nominated by the Lib-

erty Party for the EC post after

his victory in the primary, the re-
sults of which were given to the
chairmen of both parties by the
Ring-tum Phi editors.

The number of freshmen voting
was 220, and the ballots gave
instructions for each voter to in-
dicate two choices; however about
half of the freshmen voted for
only one candidate. Kline totalled
111 votes, Matthews 66 votes, and
Saunders 62 xotes.

Following these three were Rich-
ard Nash with 38, and John Rey-
nolds and Ed Armentrout.

Matthews’ Qualifications
Matthews served as_ president,

vice president, and secretary of his

student body in high school. He was
captain of the football team, presi-
dent of the freshman class, vice
president of the varsity club, Citizen
of the Year, and recipient of a
school senior service award. At W&L
Matthews is on the freshman
football team and is a member of
the Federation of Christian Athletes.
He has not yet pledged a fraternity.

Steve Saunders
Saunders was Key Club governor
of New York while in high school,
and was a class officer for four years.
He was Chief Justice of the Student
Court, President of Quill and Scroll,

co-editor of the school newspaper,

and a debater.

Saunders also was President of his
Key Club and Parliamentarian of his
student council. At W&L he has
pledged ZBT fraternity, is a Ring-
tum Phi staff member, co-program
chairman of the Civil War Round
Table, a Young Republican, and a
participant in the Mission Commit-
tee of the UCA.

Kline (see Kline’s qualifications
for office elsewhere on this page)
is so far the freshman choice for
the EC office. There was no doubting
the completeness of his victory over
the other freshmen on the primary
ballot, all of whom had earned a
place on the ballot by their showing
in an earlier preferential vote.

There is a possibility that Kline's
pledge class or other pledges in his
party were pushed to vote for him,
but the other candidates in the pri-
mary could have just as well been
similarly pushed.

Poll A First
The poll was backed by both edi-
tions of the Ring-tum Phi and is the
first of its kind at Washington and
Lee.

berty Split,

Path Split In Three Years

Sees Nine Houses Regroup;
Liberty Party Disintegrates

The old University Party
which dominated the W&L
campus for many decades un-
til it broke up last year, re-
turneyl to power early this

morning as nine disgruntled
houses banded together and took
the familiar name as their own.

For the most part the nine houses
were former members of the old
Big Clique: Beta KA, Phi Delt,
PiKA, SAE, Phi Gam, EPE, Delt
and Kappa Sig. Result o fthe new
combination mean that Red Square
is split up again, with Sigma Nu
and Phi Kap left out of the Univer-
sity Party. formerly the two houses
were included in the University
bloc.

The Liberty Party, which con-
tained ten houses until last night,
and has nominated Jody Kline for
Freshman EC, was left with four
houses this morning: Sigma Nu, Phi
Kap, Pi Phi, and Lambda Chi.

The Progressive Party, which had
five houses until last night but had
not yet nominated a freshman EC
candidate, is left with two houses:
Phi Psi and ZBT.

The Remaining houses, Sigma Chi,
Phi Ep, and DU were still in the
independent column as of this morn-
ing.

Abolish Parties

Early this afternoon a number of
fraternities, including independents
and party members both, met at the
ZBT house to consider a new con-
cept of political systems and to try
to arrive at some means of abolish-
ing parties on campus altogether.
The success of this discussion was
uncertain as the Ring-t-um Phi went
went to press.

The new chairman of the Universi-
ty Party is James Jennings, and
Geof Butler is the secretary-treasur-
er. Jennings stated that the new
party formed for the purpose of
eliminating instability in politics and
in order to ensure a fully qualified
man was nominated for freshman
EC.

Nominee Nash

The nine houses nominated Rich-
ard Nash, Beta Pledge, for fresh-
man EC, which
will be decided
next Monday.
Nash was vice
president of his
senior class in
high school, a
member of the

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

A Word On Freshman EC Elections

Nomination to the Executive Committee
from the freshman class has traditionally been
the kiss of death to the unfortunate winners.
It is a sure sign that they will never be elected
to further office, and lately it has also been
a good indication that they won’t even grad-
uate from Washington and Lee. The reason
for this deplorable circumstance is that this
office, the only one in the freshman class, has
always been a football to be tossed around
each fall by the political parties. The cliques
have calculatedly passed around this EC post
from house to house, considering mainly the
expedient of pacifying whichever house need-
ed the prestige of an EC member.

The eight or ten men who nominate
each party’s freshman EC candidates every
year try hard to reconcile expediency with
justice; they go so far as to be fairly sure that
the man they nominate is the best-qualified
pledge of the house whose turn it may be in
any particular year. But this hasn’t been
enough. It has made the freshman EC position
a graveyard. It has usually kept the best can-
didates from being nominated. And worse, it
has been the resaon that the freshman Execu-
tive Committeeman has not been a good rep-
resentative of his class. The truth is that the
freshman Committeeman has been the repre-
sentative of the political clique of the majority
party.

Will it be the same this year? Will the
class of 1968 bloc-vote another Big Clique
candidate into office? And will this freshman
class elect another man in a succession of “‘dis-
appearing freshman EC members,” an EC
member who cannot represent his class be-
cause he was not really chosen by it? The
Tuesday Ring-tum Phi hopes that this year will
be different. This newspaper is nominally a
Liberty Party paper, but it cannot in con-
science support the existing political system.

In the hope of improving on the present
system of nominating freshman EC candi-
dates, both editions of the Ring-tum Phi have
sponsored a preferential balloting, and then
a primary. These polls have established no
official machinery, of course; but they have
given the freshmen a voice, which is at least
a good precedent. The polls brought forth a
number of good candidates for office, and
publicized their qualification to hold office. If
anything further is done, the freshmen them-
selves will have to do it. They can act as their
fraternities instruct them, as they have done
traditionally. Or, the freshmen can take things
into their own hands and refuse to be used.
They can see to it that there is some choice
offered in this election, not just the dictates of
the little men from the smoke-filled rooms.
If the parties don’t nominate the best men,
the freshmen can easily enough make their
own nominations. How this is to be done
from here, is up to the class as a whole, and
to those men who have received support in the
primary and preferential voting. But it can be
done, as it has been done on occasion in the
past.

A party nomination for one of the men
who led in the Ring-tum Phi polls must, of
course be applauded. It is a recognition of
the freshmen’s preferences—and not merely
of certain pledge classes, but of the entire
freshman class. But even if two, or perhaps
three representative candidates are in the run-
ning, the fight will be far from won. After the
parties concede the freshman a voice in nom-
inating, there will still be the problem of the
tremendous pressure put on the freshmen to
vote the party choice.

The freshmen must vote their own judg-
ment, not their fraternity affiliation, if they
are to elect the best representative. But each
fraternity has at least one expert at “whipping
the boys into line,” and he will threaten the
freshmen with everything up to eternal dam.
nation unless they vote the party ticket. The
success the politicians have had in doing this is
astounding, in view of the fact that there is
nothing whi h can really force the freshmen
the ticket. The election is by secret
ballot. The threats of the politicians wouldn't
impress anybody but a freshman, because they
aren't credible—they lack substance.
Even a freshman will listen only the first time
he hears the spiel.

hope the freshman will treat this election with

the respect it deserves, not as the Clique will
treat it—one more place to be filled on the
gravy train. We hope the freshmen will vote
their consciences.

We Should Have Known Better

This campus has seen the passing of what
was one of the greatest campus political ma-
chines here in decades. Casualties by way of
graduation, transfers, and loss of interest have
completely broken up the organization which
elected two student body presidents and num-
erous lower officers in its brief but guady ca-
reer. Last year the organization’s demise be-
came assured when the old Progressive Party
hit the rocks and a new party was formed,
largely under the impetus of sophomores. The
new Liberty Party, controlled by these rela-
tive newcomers to politics, has its first out-
ing next week. It has some big shoes to fill.

The big question in campus politics now
is this: Will the new party organization be
able to work together efficiently enough to
fill the vacuum left by the passing of The
Organization which ruled for the last few
years? Will it, perhaps, become another Uni-
versity Party, a campus mammoth which may
settle down and control student elections for
several decades? The approaching freshman
EC election is the first test of strength for the
new party. On paper it looks like a champ; it
has about a two-to-one majority over the weak-
ened Progressives, one-time inheritors of the
old University Party mantle. But funny things
can happen in that secret ballot voting. What
is important to remember is that the Liberty
Party MUST win this election and win it
big—as big as its majority—or else fall apart.

Not only is this first election crucial
the test flight of Liberty Party cohesiveness;
it is also critical for the new party because it
needs this office “in the bank” as a reserve,
a victory to which it can point, because it
faces the odd fact that the Progressive Party,
although only half the size of the Liberty,
owns over two-thirds of next year’s recognized
potential student body officers. The Progres-
sive Party now contains the president, vice
president and both EC members of the rising
senior class. Thus the ten-house party, fan-
tastically enough, stands too take a real beat-
ing in spring student body voting, and if the
party makes a bad showing next week.
the chances of surviving these successive dis-
asters would be remote.

So the stakes next week for the Liberty
Party are high. But assuming that the Liber-
ty Party gets past this first test, how will it get
around the obstacle of a shortage of strong
candidates next spring? At this point in the
year it is really hard to see what can keep
such a party together; it has too many houses
and too few candidates. The last three years
here have been very liquid as far as party
makeup is concerned. This year looks like
still another year of flux.

Lo, the Poor Cadets

With Openings just around the corner, a
sense of human decency urges us to speak
out in behalf of our long-suffering neighbors,
the Veemies. Last year the cadets weren't al-
lowed to drink alcoholic beverages, and this
year their administration has come up with
the perhaps equally dampening rule that
cadets may not enter fraternity houses. Neith-
er one of these rules is fair to a man old
enough and sufficiently mature to be a college
student.

It was at the end of last year that cadets
were excluded from houses by their own ad-
ministration, due to several small ruckuses
between cadets and students. Since then the
Interfraternity Council has gone on record as
favoring the return of cadets to fraternities,
but by invitation only. This is the arrange-
ment which should have been in effect all
along, and seems to be a mutually agreeable
arrangement. However, no acceptance of this
idea has some from VMI

It is ridiculous to think that if a student
has a good friend at VMI, he cannot invite
the cadet to his fraternity house. General
Shell's restrictions have cut off the only real
means of intercourse between the two schools.
There is almost no other time besides week-
ends when cadets and students can meet, and
there are certainly no places in Lexington
other than fraternity houses where they are
very likely to meet and get to know each
other. The Ring-tum Phi urges General Shell
to take fraternity houses off the
list tor cadets.

“off-limits”

By LAMAR LAMB

In the current Presidential cam-
paign, there has been a great deal
of talk using such
terms as “Peace”
and “National
Strength. The Re-
publican nominees
have charged that
Democrats will
lead us into war
through weakness,
that we should
maintain peace
through strength.
The Democrats, on
the other hand,
have claimed that the Republican
party is irresponsible and will cer-
tainly lead us into war.

In this campaign, neither side has
really come to grips with the actual
disagreement. Both parties have long
argued on what is essentially two
different planes. In the first place,
most Americans could probably
agree with Senator Goldwater that}
a weak United States would almost
certainly be a short-lived one. A
weak America could be forced into}

weakness could lead to war, we must
also point out that he is wrong in
his assertion that the present Ad-
ministration has followed a_ policy
of weakness and accommodation.

Goldwater is wrong when he
says that the essential issue is
between ‘strength’ and ‘weakness.’
The central issue in this campaign
is whether the United States would
follow an essentially diplomatic or
an essentially militaristic policy in
its foreign relations.

President Johnson’s position is
basically sound. We must maintain
America’s strength. We must keep
up in development of new weapons,
and in conventional warfare poten-
tial. But we must be always willing
to negotiate. We must be willing to
deal with the Soviet Union, in
strength, not weakness, where we
can find legitimate areas of mutual
concern and can share mutual bene-
fi.t

It certainly would be to the ad-
vantage of both East and West to
seek ways of mutual survival. Sen-
ator Goldwater, though, has decided
he just dosen’t like Communists, and
is going to get rid of them. Un-
fortunately, when he tries we will
all go with him.

It is naive and the most danger-
ous sort of absolutist thinking to
believe that the world can be pre-
served by constant threats of war,
| withdrawal of recognition of the
Soviet Union, or a policy of “liber-

ation” of Eastern Europe. Certainly

 

1. To vote

2. to equal treatment before the
law

3. to hold property

4. to the protection of contracts
These civil rights should and must}
be vigorously enforced

However, I challenge anyone to
show me, where in the constitution,

it states that the Federal government
has the authority to tell a citizen
with whom he may associate in con-
nection with employment and pub-
lie accommodations. Do we have the
right to hire whom we please and
to allow those whom we please upon
our private property or don't we?
Goldwater says we do, LBJ
we don't!

Diplomacy vs. Militarism Choice

we should maintain a strong Amer-
ica; but we should remember that
to maintain any America, we will
have to have a measure of tolerance
and willingness to negotiate with
those who oppose us.

We notice, by the way, that last
Saturday Senator Goldwater came
out four-square on that old election
issue, God. He acknowledged his
support for an amendment to the
constitution which would allow
public school prayers. He asked, “Is
this the time...for our federal
government to ban God Almightly
from school rooms?” Not only have
the Democrats unfairly kept God
out of the school, he continued, but
their silence on the Prayer Amend-
ment showed their “utter disregard
of God.”

While sinful Lyndon is disre-
garding the sort of God who can
be banned from school rooms, holy
Barry has disregarded most o fthe
established religious community in
the United States. Almost every
national religious group, from the
Jews to the Baptists, has round-
ly criticized the Prayer Amend-
ment which Senator Goldwater
favors so much.

Most Americans, Christians and
non-Christians alike, are solidly in
favor of the separation of church
and state, and support the recent
Supreme Court decision on the mat-
ter, but not Senator Goldwater.
Apparently this is one pursuit of lib-
erty which is a vice.

be straight. Senator Goldwater is
unalterably opposed to segregation.
If there be any doubt, you are re-
ferred to his record as a citizen and
legislator within the state of Ari-

zona. The question involved here

| is not whether men should associate,

that is a matter of the
question is whether the Federal
government has the authority to
make men associae, The Senator has
stated, “I find no constitutional basis
for the exercise of federal regulatory
authority with regard to private
enterprise in connection with the
areas of so called ‘public accommo-
dations’ and ‘employment.’ I believe

to Johnny Keane, the manager of the St. Louis Cardinals,
for having the nerve to predict in the middle of August the
Cardinals would win the National League Pennant. At that
time the Cardinals were eight or nine games off first place set
by the Philadelphia Phillies, and sports fans just took his
prediction with a grain of salt.

to Joe Lyles for developing such a fine soccer team this
year despite the facts that his leading scorer and his outstand-
ing goalie graduated and that several of his top reserves de-
clined to play this season.

to Dave Redmond, Pete Preston, Howard Busse for the
excellent jobs they are doing in keeping the oppositions’ shots
on the Generals’ goal at a minimum.

to Bob Larus for the excellent job of goal tending he is
doing, much to the surprise of many. Larus has been a major
reason for the soccer team’s undefeated record.

to Dick Miller for the superior job he does as wrestling
and cross-country coach and, last but not least, equipment
manager for the entire athletic department. His job as equip-
ment manager is totally thankless, but he completes it with
high efficiency, although he often incurs the wrath of coaches
and athletes alike.

Frosh fottballer Luke Crosland (43) carries ball in Friday's 7-0 loss

Tuesday Sports Writer
Bridgewater's Ron Tilgner tossed a 33-yard scoring strike
to his quick wingback Larry Crabhill to upset Washington
and Lee’s freshmen, 7-0, last Friday, for the Generals’ second
consecutive setback. It was merely a case of sluggish offense
which spelled disaster for W&L as the locals could manage

only 71 yards on the ground and seven through the air.

savage attack, the Bridgewater

this season,

passing combination of

riment

 

By JAMES CROTHERS

t’s too bad losing teams don’t get
All-Americans. Because if the Gen-
erals could have won all or even
all but one of their contests, they
would have two strong contenders
for the post-season honors in pas-
sers Larry Craig and receiver Bill
David.

Craig and David have connected
for 21 completions for 213 yards. At
this pace, after only three of nine
games completed, both have good
chances for school and CAC rec-
ords. This is not to say that the
rest of the team is unworthy of
mention, but it is rare to find a team
with a 1-2 record and such an out-
standing passing attack.

David Remains Key Receiver

Craig also throws to end Tersh
Baker and this combination has been
good for 7 completions for 71 yards.
Halfback David remains, however,
as the key receiver. Last year, even
when the Generals did not have
to rely on the aerials, David caught
enough passes to rank him among
the leaders in the state and led the
CAC in this department.

In other statistics that might be in-
eresting to the general public, full-
back John Anthony, although sty-
mied in the Centre game, now leads
the team in the rushing department
with 123 yards gained in 27 tries

 

General Air Attack Paces Team
Craig, David Combination Clicks

PRIA IAA A

for a very impressive average of 4.6
yards per carry. With several good
games on this brusing fullback’s
part, Anthony could conceivably
win the CAC rushing title.

It seems impossible that the Gen-
erals are throwing the pigskin as

* | usually

 

much as they are. (It also seems
impossible that we're throwing the|
games away as much as we are,!
but...) Anyway Washington and}
Lee has taken to the air 59 times in|
three games and has completed 29
of these attempts. Craig is now 29
for 56 in the air—a very respectable
average—with only one interception,
while this virtual “rookie” has
| amassed 289 yards via passes.
Watch the Passes This Week

And...if you think W&L threw
the football the first three games of
the year, watch Saturday's contest
With the running attack gaining only
45 yards against Centre, it's a good
bet the Generals won't find much
more running room versus the Sus-
quehanna (Oh, my God) Crusaders.
Therefore, the home team will be
forced to pass, and maybe, find a
weak (7?) spot in SU's defense.

For this reason—W&L’s passing
times Baker—it is possible that the
Generals might not do as badly as
everyone (including the football
team, itself) thinks. Like the man
| said “Anything's possible.”

 

Centre Tops Generals, 8-0
In First CAC Performance

Washington and Lee saw their hopes for contention in the
CAC standings dashed by a determined Centre College squad,
8-0. The Generals failed to dominate Saturday’s game on the
ground as they had done the previous two outings.

Indeed, W&L gained only

a net total of 4 yards rushing.

However, the General passing game again exceeded 100 yards

 

Soccer Figures
Credit Defense

In recently released soccer sta-
tistics, the reasons for the booters
undefeated string become evident. In
the first four games, W&L has
given up only three goals while
scoring eleven.

Goalie Bob Larus has been the
stalwart of the General defense
compiling a total of 25 saves. Co-
captain Pete Preston and his full-
back companion Dave Redman have
also done outstanding jobs on de-
fense with 18 and 17 saves respec-
tively.

Although the scoring statistics are
very important, this year
the booters have relied on a stringent
defense. However, in the scoring de-
partment, Tim Henry leads the team
with six points (4 goals and 2 as-
sists), while Dave Kirkpatrick is
close behind him with 4 points (2
goals and 2 assists) .

As of now Washington and Lee

*with Larry Craig completing 14 of
27 attempts. Another so-called
vital statistic proved false as W&L
gathered 13 first downs to Centre’s
six.

Centre scores Long TD

The Colonel’s first and only score
came with Centre punting deep into
W&L territory. Centre blocked a
quick-kick attempt by John An-
thony and recovered the ball just
seven yards short of the end zone.
In two short plunges the Colonels
scored against W&L’s defensive
“Hungry Dogs.”

The Generals spent the remainder
of the game making short frustrat-
ing drives in a vain attempt to come
from behind. Early in the second-
half, W&L lost the services of An-
thony their leading ground gainer,
along with co-captain Tom Cren-
shaw and Skip Chase.

With 10:53 remaining in the fourth
quarter the Generals obtained pos-
session on their own 30-yard line
and started their most serious threat

 

Susquanna, the Generals’ next
opponent, upped its record Satur-
day to 4-0 by overwhelming Juni-

of the day. Using short passes to
his ends, Craig moved W&L to the
Centre seven-yard line. A_ short
plunge, an incomplete pass and a
fumble left the Generals nine yards
short of the goal with only one down
and 2:53 left in the game.

Last Minute Passes Fail

With a Homecoming crowd of over
4,000 on the edge of their seats
quarterback Craig dropped back
and fired to his favorite receiver
Bill David only to have his pass
knocked down by a Centre defender.

The Generals’ defense held the
Colonels as it has held its previous
opponents and W&L regained pos-
session with only 53 seconds left
in the game. These final moments
were spent in futile long passes and
some more successful short ones.

movie, since it is probably one of
the greatest Italian post-war movies
since “Open City” or “The Bicycle
Thief.” For realism above the tech-
nicholor candy of a “633 Squadron,”
“The Four Days of Naples” will as-
tonish anyone appreciating the con-
sequences of heroism.

At GT&E, we've made diversification pay
off in all-around growth. That's because
we've concentrated on related fields of
operation. For instance, yesterday's met-
allurgical advance is today’s improved
semiconductor and tomorrow's superior

communications system.

our times. But I ask you, what has
happened to our homes and individ-
ual communities? These are the in-
stitutions that have heretofore
handled such moral problems. Is the
federal government to take away
the rights of the local autonomous
community? Do you really believe
that a bureaucracy can better handle
our problems? If you do, you have
lost confidence in our federal Re-
public, if you don’t then you should
be willing to stand up and be

Senator Goldwater has said, “I
am just old fashioned enough to be-
lieve that people—not bureaucrats,
not self-styled experts, not self-
annointed wise men, but plain peo-
ple know best what their needs are
and how best they may be served.”
It is because of and not in spite of
our complex 20th century growth
that the locality can most effectively
meet human needs.

“It is the general welfare that
must be considered now, not just
the specials appeals for special wel-
fare. This is the tim toBTAOI
fare. This is the time to attend to
the liberties of all.”

“This is my concern. And this is
where I stand.”

As a young and aggressive company
with no limit to its growth, GT&E is an

organization you may wish to think of in

manufacturing and

operations, GT&E has become one of

the light of your own future.
