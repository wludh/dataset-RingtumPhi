THE RING-TUM PHI

R-tP Explains Critical View, Praises Facets Of W&L Life

Throughout this school year, the Ring-tum Phi has been)
criticizing various facets of Washington and Lee life. Some-
times we have doubtless seemed too harsh, too vindictive, too
bitter. We have seemed an organ of destructive purpose,
rather than constructive intent.

Why have we bothered? Why have we made an effort to
examine the Washington and Lee situation? I think the pur-
pose of our criticism, its reason, lies within a philosophy of
criticism. We are concerned. Any criticism implies a concern;
criticism, instead of implying bitterness or hatred, actually im-
plies a compliment to the object of our criticism. The target
of our criticism must be worthy of criticism; we must care in
order to criticize.

What is there about Washington and Lee that makes us
care, that makes us concerned, that makes us feel a strong de-
votion to the school? We will make a radical departure from
this year’s editorial policy and examine the elements that have
made us love W&L enough to criticize it so much,

* The Honor System. Much has been said about the
Honor System, perhaps too much. The Honor System gives
order to our lives here and embeds within students a noble
value system. Let us not delude ourselves by making it trite
or commonplace.

* Extensive personal freedom. Washington and Lee has
few petty rules that put irrelevant or insignificant limits on our
freedoms.

%* Personal access to, and relationship with professors. Stu-
dents here are able to have more than a classroom relationship
with professors. All students are able to take advantage of this
valuable opportunity for education unimpeded by the class-
room situation.

* Excellent potential for education. We would not hesi-
tate to match our faculty against any comparable college in the
nation. The facilities and educational tools are available, en-
abling a student to obtain as good an education as he would
find anywhere.

* Social and Academic Balance. Many have complained
that W&L is not co-ed nor is it located in a metropolitan area.
We see this as an implement to academic challenge, recogniz-
ing at the same time that there is no durst of social life at
Wa&L. The two realms — academic and social — exist in a
balance, which is as it should be.

* Administration. We are blessed in having a just and
progressive administration which has escaped the legalistic trap
that many an administration has fallen into. The administra-
tion does a remarkable job of taking the pulse of student body
opinion and accommodating that opinion if they consider it

 

at all feasibly possible.

THOMAS, LTD.

 

* Student Self-government. The existence of a powerful
Executive Committee, Dorm Counselors, the four major com-
mittees (Library, Cold Check, Assimilation, and Control), the
IFC, and an uncensored student newspaper all stand witness
to the extensive power students have in governing themselves.

* Sophisticated, intelligent student body.

Just as this year has been a year of criticism — purposeful
criticism, so it has been a year of growth in many areas:

* Self-Study. The all-inclusive self-study which the Uni-

versity has undertaken, not as a perfunctory duty, but as a
sincere and dedicated effort to investigate Washington and Lee
is evidence of the fact that the faculty and administration are
enthusiastically concerned to discover and improve areas in
which we may be deficient. We are not required to conduct
such a thorough survey as has been planned, but a discovery
of our deficiencies is a prerequisite of their progressive solution.

* Cut System. This year the cut system has been revised
in an effort to increase the student’s responsibility for his own
self-education. This increased freedom places the emphasis of
education upon its desirability rather than on the discipline of
having to go to classes. The revision is not inherently benefi-
cent; it will only be advantageous as students make it. In
loco parentis has been abolished in favor of student responsi-
bility.

%* First Mock Honor Trial. In an effort to clarify any ob-
scurities or mysteriousness surrounding the Honor System, the
EC has held a mock trial in order to explain the procedure of
such a trial. In addition to this, the EC this year has proved
more daring than the large majority of those in the past.

* Integration Barrier. The clarification of the Admissions
policy to the effect that anyone applying to W&L will be given
equal consideration has shown contemporaneousness to be one
of the school’s assets. :

* Political System. Although far from perfect, our politi-.
cal system has progressed from the Boss Tweed days to a more
healthy situation characterized by individual initiative and gen-
eral openness. A candidate must now rely on his own ability
and integrity in order to win an election.

* Contact Weekend. The IFC-sponsored intellectual sym-
posium has been a challenging, successful venture into an area
in which students have not played a motivating role in the past.
It is our prediction that ‘Contact’ will make the most of its
successful initiation to become even more stimulating in the
future.

%* Speakers. Although the number and quality of speak-
ers lecturing on campus has always been one of W&L’s strong
points, this year has proven even better than most with Charles
Percy, Karl Schapiro, Eugene Buttrick, James Silver, Francis
P. Miller, Sir Fitzroy Maclean, and many others all putting
in impressive appearances.

There is much to be proud if at W&L, much that causes
one to feel an attachment to the University. Washington and
Lee is far more worthy of criticism than any amateur efforts
we have been able to make. Washington and Lee has become
a part of us.

to the New Students

The traditions of Washington and Lee University require conven-

solely for the W&L man and features the natural

shoulder style prevailing on

The correct appearance of both “on and off” campus is so very im-
portant throughout the school year . . .

AND YOU CERTAINLY WANT TO LOOK YOUR BEST
DURING RUSH WEEK.

Our long experience with W&L men enables us to soundly advise
and fill all your complete clothing requirements in the beginning

An alumnus of Washington and

Wytheville, was insirumental in set-

ting up the special fund to purchase
the memorial books,

The volumes will be placed in the
University’s McCormick Library for
general circulation. Henry Coleman,
present University librarian, said the
money will be used to buy biograph-
ies, “because Miss Annie Jo’s chief
means of interesting students in
reading was to start them on bio-
graphies. She believed the students
would become interested in the per-
son and the times in which he or
she lived, and want to read more
about them and their times.”

“Miss Annie Jo,” University libra-
rian from 1895-1922, perhaps is bet-
ter remembered as the originator of
Washington and Lee’s famous Fancy
Dress Ball. The beginning of “the

“Miss Annie Jo“ continued to su-|

and was an honored guest at each
ball until her death in 1938 at the
age of 85.

Miss White also helped students
stage plays to raise funds to buy
equipment for athletic teams. She
once had the honorary title of “Lady
Vice President of W&L.” Active in
local civic work, she also was in-

Mrs. Stonewall Jackson of her fam-|

Includes 3 Merit Scholars

 

Record 350 Frosh Enter

From a record number of 1550 ap-
plicants, 350 high school and prep
school seniors have been chosen to
compose Washington and Lee’s Class
69. The previous record for aup-
plicants was 1480 students set last
year, This year’s acceptance by 350
boys also topped last fall’s 340.

In an announcement earlier this
month, James Farrar, Dean of Ad-
missions, said the Committee on Ad-
missions passed favorably on 630 ap-

i
oO.

plications from the 1550 they had
received.

The Committee on Admissions
consists of Deans Atwood, Farrar,

Gilliam, John, and Professors Bar-
ritt, Coulling, Jarrard, Jenks, Jen-
nings, Jones, Pinney, Ravenhorst,
Spencer and Stephenson.

For the first time since 1962, Na-
tional Merit Scholarship winners will!
be among the entering Freshman
class. Three students will hold these
scholarships. In 1962, there was only |
one.

Class Is Strong

Overall statistics on the class have!
not yet been catalogued, But Dean
Farrar said, “The entering class is a
particularly strong one and we are
very happy to have the Merit Schol-
arship winners included in it.”

The College Board SAT scores are)
expected to be higher than last year’s |
602 verbal and 635 math average.
The average class standing, while!
varying from school to school, is
expected to be in the first and sec-|

| bridge County and present an ac-

present North-South distribution is
expected.
Scholarships and Loans
“Financial in scholar-
ships and loans has risen thirty per-
cent,” said Dean John, Associate di-

assistance

rector of Admissions. This rise is
principally due to a recent anon-
ymous donation toward the Lee

Scholarship program.

Six Baker and ten Lee Scholar-
ships, paying the complete cost of
tuition, were granted. Fifty-seven

students will take part in the grant-
loan program and six others have
received Washington Awards. These
awards are token grants of $100
honoring particularly well-qualified
applicants.

Four local high school students
will receive Rockbridge County
grants. These scholarships are spon-
sored by the university and cover
much of tuition costs. To qualify
one must be a resident of Rock-

ceptable high school record.
Commenting on the financial aid
program, Dean John said, “T am

gratified that we were able to help) ,

as many applicants as we did. In
the past the program has contributed
greatly to maintaining the high
quality of the student body, and I

expect it to continue doing so in|'

 

the future.”
Freshmen will come to Lexington |

on or before September 7.
Freshman camp starts on that date |

Finals President and Vice-Presidents

President Jody Brown, (top left) an SAE from Memphis, has selected
his vice-presidents for this year’s Finals. They are (1 to r) Bill Price,
SAE; Larry Manning, Beta; Joe Bear, Phi Delt; (bottom) Dave Geer, Phi
Delt; Ashley Allen, KA; and Rick Carrell, SAE.

All the veeps are seniors, Brown said that he hoped this year's Finals
would be something to remember. He thought the outdoor concert would
help, especially since Lexington weather has pushed 90 degrees every day
for the past two weeks.

On Thursday the Joe Lynn Quartet, a local group, will play for the
Senior Dance which will be held in Evans Dining Hall.
