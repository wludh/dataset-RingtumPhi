Left-Wingers
Uphold Cause
In THRUST

THRUST, W&L’s new liberal club,
began its official existence at an or-|
ganizational meeting last Monday |
night. According to its constitution, |
THRUST has been organized to
represent the liberal and moderate |
political element at W&L, to bring
controversal issues before the in-|
tellectual community and to active-|
ly support issues and candidates it)
considers desirable.

THRUST was conceived last spring |
by ZBT junior Sydney Lewis, who,
wih a nucleus of supporters, felt!
that the politieal balance at W&L
was excessively weighted toward the |
right. |

Until last spring, the only W&L
political organizations were the!
right-wing Conservative Society and’
the just slightly less conservative
Young Republicans.

During he summer, Lewis, Roger
Sennott, Jeffrey Skarda, and John
Klegg operated an organizational
committee. The committee formu-
lated plans and raised a small
amount of money from alumni.

At matriculation, THRUST had an
information and registration table in
Payne Hall and obtained about thir-
ty dues-paying members.

Then at the Monday meeting,
THRUST Officially adopted its con-
stitution and elected officers.
Lewis was chosen to be the first
president, Roger Sennoit was
elected vice-president, Richard
Margolies was elected recording
secretary, Jeffrey Skarda was
elected corresponding secretary,
and William Surbaugh was elect-
ed treasurer.

After electing officers, THRUST
voted to officially support the
Johnson-Humphrey ticket. A motion
to support Robert Kennedy in the
New York senate race failed, how-
ever.

Thrust is now engaged in a voter
registration drive for Rockbridge |
County, and it plans to begin a)
letter-writing campaign soon. Later, |
THRUST hopes to bring eminent
liberal speakers to W&L.

In its voter registration drive,
THRUST members are working with
colored students from Lexington’s
Downinng High School. Specifically, |
the drive involves a door-to-door)
campaign to convince people to)
register and to transport them to)
the registration bureau in Lexington. |
In a week's work, THRUST has)
registered approximately forty vot-
ers. On November 3, THRUST will
have poll watchers to make sure |
that registered voters actually vote. |

Air Conditioning, Enlarged Size
‘Promised For 1965 Delt House

Jim Slay, president of the W&L
chapter of Delta Tau Delta fraterni-
ty, has revealed tentative plans for
the construction of a new house to
replace the building destroyed by
fire on September 5. According to
Lexington fire chief Peyton Craft,
the fire, of as-yet undetermined or-
igin, left the house and everything
in it a “total loss.” The Delts have
relocated at the old SPE house on
Meyers Street.

The present sehedule calls for
completion of the new house by May
or June of 1965, assuring Delta Tau
Delta a permanent home before the
’65-'66 school year. Slay stated that
the new house would probably be
built at the same location, although
the fraternity is considering the pur-
chase of a lot. The new house will
be built on the same general archi-
tectural plans as the old, but the
chapter will
minor changes. The front rooms
will be larger, bedroom capacity will
be increased and a party room in
the basement will open into the din-
ing room through felding doors. Air
conditioning and other such im-
provements are planned.

The chapter has started replacing

Pledging Increases Markedly
Rush System Produces Gain

Under the influence o fa new rush system, this year’s pledging showeda marked increase
of 8 per cent with 79 per cent of the freshmen pledging fraternities as compared with 71 per
cent last year. Another indication of this rush week success is that only 84.4 per cent of the
freshman class registered for rush.

Steve Hibbard, IFC president, stated that that the IFC was very satisfied with the result of

the new rush system. He further*

stated that on the first day of open
houses there was an uneven distri-
bution of freshmen, but the next day
this evened out.

Most of the houses got from be-
tween 10 to 20 pledges. Hibbard
stated that “This tends to indicate
that this new rush system has defi-
nite advantage over the old; how-
ever, there are many points of con-
tention that will be discussed in
next Friday’s issue.”

Sigma Chi got the most pledges,
22, and ZBI followed wih 21. The

A Word to Freshmen: You'll Learn

By now 338 new ones have come to W&L,
have looked at the old buildings and the new,
have met the people across the hall and on
the other floor, have heard from the presi-
dent and the deans, have conferred frankly
or superficially with their dorm counselors,
have pledged fraternities, and started classes.
They’re beginning to know their way around
the campus now, but they are still very ob-
viously freshmen. They still have an awful lot
to learn.

They realize how much they don’t know
and how little they do know, but it doesn’t
seem to bother them now. They are eager to
find out, and they feel that they have come
to the right place for learning. In fact, ask
one of them why he has come to college—to
W &L—at all, and he will say: I came to learn.

And freshmen, you are right. You will
learn here. But many of the things you seek
you will not find, while in their place you will
learn things you never suspected and things
you never would choose to know.

HA

Ww

If you have formed an image of W&L as
“College,” then you will learn very early to
put that image aside. For “College” is a hazy
mixture of ivied walls, fatherly and inspir--
ing professors, football weekends, all night
bull sessions, fraternal revelry, enlightening
bouts with knowledge, and a community of
scholars. This ideal verson of “College” may
indeed exist somewhere, but it is not totally
intact here at W&L. Washington and Lee is
an institution unique to itself, and it is very
capable of teaching its own ways to all those
who come to it.

You will learn as the year wears on that
The Thing at W&L is Greek affiliation. Oh
yes, make your grades, get some knowledge,
but just be sure you don’t miss pledge meet-
ings, or ball games, or lunch, or parties,
ot pledge raids, or whatever else you are told
to attend. You will learn what pressure is, and
you will bend to it. It will be disheartening to
watch you, freshmen, as the vows you made
before coming to college give way when put
to the test. But then, it happens every year.

Learning at W&L

How much you will learn at W&L! It
will be an eye-opening day when you first real-
ize that, contrary to all you feared, you are
as intelligent as those around you, that the
genius next door who made atomic reactors all
summer is now making poorer grades than
you, that the entering freshman class does not
consist of 337 superhumans and you.

It may shock you when you realize that
you are actually capable of doing college
work, but then the shock will be greater for
those who learn that they do not have what
it takes. But before long most of you will
realize that college is not as hard as you were
led to believe, that carmming the night before
is often good for an A, that rhetorical verbo-
sity goes a long way on themes and papers,
that a C can sometimes be made without any
effort at all, and that in some courses an
acquaintance with classroom notes will get
you a good mark even if you haven't read the
assigned material. But you will also become
acquainted with the all-night stand, the mental
blackout during a test, and perhaps even fail-
ure of a critical course. You will learn the
blind emphasis placed on good grades here,
and you'll probably go along, without trying
to determine the correlation between grades
and knowledge.

If you’ re looking for stimulating company,
you will find that you must search for it at
W&L. You will learn to speak of girls, grades,
Greeks and good times in order to be able to
converse here, and in looking around you will
recall that many people are either incapable
of expanding their conversational range or
they simply never let on. If you then turn
for mental prodding to your instructors, you
will learn that the faculty will reach out on a
personal basis to students, but only to those
who make the initial effort.

:
-

You will also learn to question your re-
ligious beliefs while you are at W&L, but you
probably won't begin that until you are soph-

omores. You'll learn how much harder it is to
go to church by yourself rather than with
the family. You will discover that the mes-
sage at church is dull and repetitive compared
to the message of the classroom. You will
find too that the church and the classroom
often conflict. You will learn, in a year or two,
to laugh at and nonchalanty relate sacrilegious
jokes which would shock you now, although
for a time you will apologize for each one you
tell. And no one knows just what you will

find in the end.

What else will you learn at W&L? You'll
learn to drink, yes, even those of you who
swear now you will never touch a drop. Yes,
even you. Some of you will learn to smoke
in a manner calculated to be devastating but
which is in reality comic.

You will learn to say that the Commons
is the only spot in the world where, after

two months, the roast beef, the tuna casserole,
the pork chops, the baked ham, and the ice’
cream all taste exactly alike. About a fourth

of you will learn after taking freshman chem-
istry and German, that you didn’t really want
to be a doctor at all. You'll learn to say
“sharp,” “lizard,” “‘cool’”’, “gross,” and “T’m
not believing that,’’ with every other phrase.

And if you stop to think, you will learn
the underlying futility which comes from liv-
ing in a generation and a country whose high-
est cause is to provide itself with material

things and with the Good Life.

Other Things To Learn

But there are other things to learn at W&L
and perhaps some of them will stick. Men
here can tell you of Plato, of Shakespeare, of
Dewey, and of Conrad. You can slowly learn
to realize that the deepest utterances of the
heart can be said as meaningfully in another
language. You could walk out of geology or
biology class one day and understand for the
first time what you have seen a thousand times.

You might learn what a truly unlimited
instrument the slide rule is. Some of you will
learn a lot about the mechanism which is the
human body, and somewhere along the line
you will be struck with the responsibility un-
dertaken by those who would heal. Ocas-
sionally pure hogwash, in the guise of formal
scholarship, will be given to you in the class-
room, but perhaps you will learn to distin-
guish the preposterous from the legitimate.
And you can learn invaluable lessons from
those around you who throw up in W&L’s
face their own enthusiasm of spirit It may

not be incorrect to believe that you might even

learn to think for yourself, and to be yourself.

It is true that the petty, snobbish, the
cruel, the boring, the shallow, the superficial,
the trivial, the barren pursuits are much in
evidence here, and they will certainly exert
the most pressure upon you as a student. But
the open mind, the sincere intellect, the sin-
cere interest, does exist at W&L, and where
it exists it makes room for itself. You will
learn here, but what you learn is your de-
cision.

L£
ss

There is a great discrepancy between what
W&L would teach to her students and what
the school actually imparts. The fault lies
partly with W&L’s provincialism, but most
of W&L’s pettiness comes from its students
who came here fully as unaffected as you,
freshmen, but who succumbed to the teaching
of the system and who are now dedicated to
passing it on to you. With each fall comes
the only real hope for change at W&L and
usually the hopes dies unrealized. But another
fall has come, and now you are the hope of
Washington and Lee.

It all depends on what you learn and what
you take to heart. You will have many teach-
ers, and your lessons will be numerous. What
you learn, however, will ultimately depend
upon you and on the kind of person you want
to be. It is in your hands now, and although
those of us who have been here, who have
seen, and who are concerned will help
wherever we are able, we must largely content
ourselves with nursing what is at one time our
greatest hope and our greatest fear: knowing
that you will learn.

 

  

 

Washington and Lee Expansion Plans

Could Already Be Highly Developed

By WARREN MONTGOMERY |

President Cole’s proposal for a
Lee College adjacent to the present
school is not only of great signifi-
cance, it is probably closer than
we think in reality. The president
of a major university would prob-
ably not reveal ideas of such mag-
nitude unless definite planning was
already underway. Assuming, then,
that the next ten years will bring
a new W&L, what can we tell about
its form?

Essentially, the plan presented by
Dr. Cole is to build a new college
on grounds now occupied by Lib-
erty Hall and the athletic fields.
The present school would revert to
its old name of Washington College
and the new facilities would be
called Lee College. Both institutions
would comprise a greater Washing-
ton and Lee University under a

 

 

common administration; however,
they would operate as independent
units in duplicating many required
courses. Freshman and sophomore
courses would probably be similar
in both schools, but there would be
a convenient transfer system for
the upper classes.

No one can doubt that the realiza-
tion of this plan would work great
changes on W&l.. Whether these
changes would be beneficial, how-
ever, is a matter of uncertainty.

Intellectual Expansion

There is a great deal to be said
for the two-college plan. Primarily,
the plan would enable W&L to
expand as an educational unit and
as an intellectual community. A
school like W&L with its strong
traditions and its friendly, secure
atmosphere cannot exist with more
than around 1500 students. At the

From W&L’s Theatre Go-ers

By JAMES JENNINGS |
Shakespeare ordered his players to!
speak their lines loud and clear
without shouting and to speak with
emotion but to use restraint. Rich-
ard Burton does just this in the part
of Hamlet.

Burton’s Hamlet as directed by
John Gielgud is a production that
' es » calls for nothing
but praise. We are

impressed with
Claudius in his
attempt to be a
good king and
must feel some
sympathy for him
in his certain

doom. The queen
draws on sympa-
thy when she
shows herself loy-|
al to her son and
confused by Hamlet's not accepting
Claudius as her new husband.

Ophelia and Laertes turn in ex-
cellent performances as we see their
family brought to a tragic end by
their entanglement in Hamlet's af-'
fairs.

The most notable supporting role
is that of Polonius. Hume Cronyn!
plays the meddling old courtier in
a most delightful manner. We
laugh at his long-winded demands
for brevity and his conversation
with Hamlet, and we are amused
by his claims of omniscience. The
old man seems to have some in-
sight, and a good mind, but he is
on the wrong track, so that he
never develops as the philosopher or
the omniscient character as found in
other plays of Shakespeare. Never-
theless, Cronyn makes Polonius
seem very much alive and, at times,
threatens to the show from
Burton, a feat that is impossible

 

steal

There are many interpretations of
Hamiet, and almost as much has
been written on this play as has
been written about the Bible. Bur-
ton, in his interpretations, makes
Hamlet a very emotional young
man, much troubled and confused
by his father’s death and his moth-
er’s hasty marriage He makes it
obvious that he is going to feign
madness and not that he is mad
| However, he is very emotional even
iwhen he is himself and is prone to

tanturms, when he jumps into
Ophelia’s grave, or when he abuses
his mother and slays Polonius

Does Hamlet love Ophelia? Bur-
thinks He kisses her

receives gladly in their

“us

does
her

ton he

and

scenes when Polonius and Claudius
are looking on. Only after he sees
that the two men are present does
he abuse her, either because he
thinks he is helping Claudius or be-
cause he must keep up his show.
From this point on Ophelia is caught
up in the plot and madness and
death tie in Polonius and Laertes.
We see that Hamlet truly loves her,
but the game has moved too far to
do anything about it. Many must
pay for the jealousy and ambition of
one man.

 

same time, a school that is content
to maintain a status quo soon stag-
nates. President Cole’s two-college
plan may allow us to maintain a
small school atmosphere while
physically expanding.

Furthermore, a larger University
means more teachers and more
equipment, which in turn mean a
finer standard of education. One col-
lege might specialize in sciences and
the other in arts, both achieving a
higher degree of excellence through
concentration on limited fields of

study.
Also, a larger university would
bring students of more diverse

backgrounds to W&L, adding more
to the common experience of each
student.

Finally, an enlargement of facili-
ties would help fulfill our obliga-
tion to American education to try
to accommodate more of the rising
tide of qualified college applicants.

Tendencies Toward Division

There are, however, several good
arguments against a two-college ex-
pansion. One is that the plan would
create two fiercely competitive and
alien institutions, thereby destroy-
ing the old W&L altogether. This
contention might be answered, how-
ever, by the examples of Oxford,
Cambridge, and Harvard—institu-
tions which are segmented into col-
leges but which maintain their so-
lidarity anyway. Washington College
and Lee College would be geograph-
ically adjacent, under a common ad-
ministration, and possessing a com-
mon  heritage—conditions which
have held Oxford, Cambridge, and
Harvard together. At any rate, a
little competition would stimulate
the development of both schools.

Another very pertinent objection
has been raised regarding the social
lives of 3000 or more students. The
town of Lexington offers almost no
social life. If many more students
are to be added, the university
should make plans for activities to
occupy their spare time. A student
union with beer on tap, weekly com-
bos, bowling alleys, music rooms,
pool tables, and arranged transporta-
tion to the girls’ school would al-
most be a necessity.

Value of W&L Image

Finally, it is said that the two-
college plan would destroy the
time-hallowed W&L image. Possibly
so, but can W&L afford to always
maintain the unchanging image of
a snug, isolated, small college? As
much as we might wish to keep our
present comfortable existence, the
changing times might bring obscuri-
ty if our growth ceases.

As lresident Cole pointed out in
his address last week, W&L needs
to grow, but it must do so without
sacrificing the quality of the existing
school. Whether this can be done,
and how it can done are the
problems that the administration and
trustees must solve as they plan
for a new Washington and Lee.

Junior Condescends To Provide
Memoirs, Maxims & Sage Advice

By BRUCE W. RIDER

In the first edition of the Ring-|
tum Phi we wish to direct our at-.

tention and matchless editorial skill
to the freshmen, the class of 1968

And as to the 1964 Presidential
Campaign to the contrary, we sin-
cerely hope there will be a 1968.

Originally we had planned to im-
part some sage advice to the fresh-
men, in the hope that they might
avoid some of the pitfalls of our
own freshman year.

On second thought, believe
that the freshmen have been given
enough Good Sound Advice in the
past two weeks to last them at least
to 1968, after which date the Uni-
versity is no longer responsible

And on the third thought we rath-
er enjoyed those aforementioned pit-
falls and we feel that they are an
integral part, as they the

I myself would ettle for

it would be easy

At least this year the new men
will not be wearing the immortal

‘Go’ Team, ‘Hungry Dogs’ Give
New Look to ‘Green’ Generals

By JOHNNY GRAHAM

Can a school that loses its entire starting team of
the previous year make a success of its next football
season?

This is the question for the Washington and Lee
football Generals this fall, but head coach Lee Mc-
Laughlin expresses reserved optimism that the team
can overcome its inexperience.

“We are a green team, but the boys have been work-
ing hard and the spirit is good,’ McLaughlin said. “We
are not a ‘holler’ team, but I feel that spirit is shown
by how the team hits and works.”

The Generals will use the new substitution rule ex-
tensively this season, with a three platoon system set
on a different basis than in previous years.

The “Blue” team, or first string will go both ways
with the exception of two substitutions which are per-
mitted each time the ball changes hands. The “Go”
team is a group of offensive specialists while the “Hun-
gry Dogs” specialize in defense.

Larry Craig, last year’s third team quarterback, is
handling the signal calling duties. Joining him in the
backfield are fullback John Anthony, a good worker
who saw considerable action last season, and Skip
Chase, a veteran left halfback whom McLaughlin de-
scribes as “a strong runner and a fine blocker with a
lot of hustle.”

Roundup of Opposition

 

Number four, or wing back, has three capable Blue
team players—co-captains Bill David and Tommy
Crenshaw, and junior Billy Andrews.

At center, Jeff Novinger is sidelined with a broken
hand. Chuck Long, whom McLaughlin said had played
his best football this fall, will start.

The guard positions will be held down by Joe Mil-
ler, a junior who logged the most playing time last
year of any Blue team member, and Curt Jernigan,
converted from end in spring practice.

Another converted end, Starke Sydnor, holds down
one tackle position, with Jack Kelly manning the
other.

Tersh Baker, who started last year when John
Madison was injured, is at one end, while Bob Barclay,
the team’s punter, is at the other. Barclay is the
smallest man on the line.

When the Blue team switches from offense to de-
fense, Billy Andrews and Chuck Staples will replace
Anthony and Chase.

The Generals will also feature a new innovation
in this era of the specialist. Assistant manager Cary
Green, a sophomore who kicks field goals and extra
points as a hobby, has been working out on his own.
Using his own square-toed kicking shoes, Green has
practiced several times with defensive pressure and
shows promise of becoming a top flight kicker.

Generals Picked Over Once-Beaten Yellow Jackets

By GUY UNANGST

Crushed last Saturday by Susque-
hanna, 42-0, Randolph-Macon’s
young team—it has only three sen-
iors and a coach in his first season—
plays host tomorrow to Washington
and Lee.

If W&L can contain “lonely end”
Bill Gorham and run past sopho-
more tackle Bill Baumeister, it
should repeat its victory of last year,
though not by 1963’s 28-0 count.

Yellow Jackets coach Ted Keller
favors a passing offense with quar-
terbacks Charlie D’Alessandro, and
Charlie Rippon. Both are good run-
ners, mediocre passers.

Randolph-Macon was 6-3 last sea-
son...runs from split-T... Series
should be 13-1-1, favor Generals,
after tomorrow.

How School
Got Religion

By Guy Unangst

The University of Miami, this past
June, lost nine students to its honor
code. Six were football players,
and coach Charlie Tate said their
loss weakened the team by 20 per
cent.

Which brings to mind a similar in-
cident at W&L a little more than 10
years ago.

In July of 1954, after complaining
of financial difficulties and academic
misfits due to subsidized football, and
mumbling for several years about
gradual de-emphasis, the Board of
Trustees suddenly decided to aban-
don the fall’s schedule. The reason,
buried beneath official rationaliza-
tion, was that 15 men, more than
half athletes, had been caught col-
lectively cheating.

STUDENT BODY president Wil-
liam Bailey called them a “syndi-
cate.”

The group had keys that would
open nearly every door on campus.
With the help of a janitor, they
had obtained advance copies of
quizzes, or substituted an improved
set of answers for those they had
written during a quiz period.

Have you looked at
your trousers lately?

Are they correct? Are they neatly
narrow in the leg — or too narrow
(or too wide)? Do they hang prop-
erly or do they drag on the floor?
Do they come up too high or do
they rest securely on your waist? Do
your trousers enhance your appear-
ance?

The next couple seasons are than simply clothe

W&L did field a team in ’54, one
termed “junior varsity,” immacu-
lately “amateur.” It lost its season
