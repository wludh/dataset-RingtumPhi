Policy Is

Meeting

that as a result of this it was unable
to speculate on the opinions of the
remainder of the students. Basing its
assumptions on data gathered by the
poll, the EC endeavored to discov-
er a meaningful concensus. A variety
of possible proposals were put for-
ward, but these lacked complete en-
dorsement.

Referendum Sub-Committee Formed

In an effort to fully explore the
relevance of the referendum and to
place it in the context of the entire
student body, a sub-committee was
formed to handle this comprehensive
study plan. The EC will continue full
discussion of the issue pending the
report of this group.

Several members of the EC em-
phasized the “tremendous amount of
importance attached to the conven-
tional dress issue.” They furthe1
stated that the ultimate purpose of
the study was to reconcile the tra-
dition of conventional dress and the
Assimilation Committee with the
reality of campus opinion.

The obvious concern of the EC for
this matter is illustrated by its in-
tention to act on the issue as quick-
ly as possible. A definite statement
of policy will be presented to the
student body in order to eliminate
widespread misconceptions.

Publications Budget Discussed

In other action Jim De Young,
| chairman of the student finance com-
mittee, submitted a semi-annual re-
port on the financial condition of
the EC, Calyx, Southern Collegian,
|Mock Convention Committee, and
the Ring-tum Phi. The other mem-
bers of the committee are, Jerry
Turner, Fred Mindel, Mark Apple-
feld, and Mr. Rayder of the Rock-
bridge National Bank.

Thus far the EC has totaled ex-
penditures of $193 which represents
a budget surplus if present trends
continue. The Calyx which also
shows a budget surplus at this point
has not yet achieved its advertising
goal. With a budget surplus of $150
and one of the strongest advertising
programs in recent years, the South-
ern Collegian maintains a stable fi-
nancial position. Although the Ring-
tum Phi has a budget deficite of $284,
the EC decided to take no action in
hopes the various difficulties which
have beset the publication will work
themselves out.

Politics and Student Government

If the status quo in campus politics lasts through next
spring or longer, there may be serious damage to student
government. The present situation is normal for W&L
insofar as the existence of an overwhelming majority
party is concerned; but it is something new that the fra-
ternities not‘included in the majority are not even organ-
ized into a party. It is something new, and something
dangerous for the existence of an effective student govern-
ment.

If, as is now possible, the University Party nominates
candidates who are unopposed by candidates of another
party, there will be no doubt as to the results; the Uni-
versity Party will, by nominating candidates, be electing
officers. In other words, student body officers will be elect-
ed not by campus vote, but by Clique representatives, the
University Party wheels. Such a system of selecting stu-
dent body officers will have two particularly harmful ef-
fects on student politics: first, it will mean that on many
occasions the best men will have no substantial chance
of being elected; second, it will destroy interest in and
competition for student body offices, and thus eventually
undermine student government itself.

The possibility of any improvement under something
like the present party system is not encouraging. Party
history in the last several years has been a story of switch,
collapse, and start again: four years ago the University
Party held an unapproachable majority over the hapless
Independent Party. This began to dissatisfy some campus
politicians, who formed the Progressive Party, which held
a majority for one election. Then the University Party
made a brief return to power, only to fall before the
formation of the Liberty Party, which began the present
school year with ten houses. The Liberty Party, however,
didn’t even last through its first election; discontent-
ed with its nominations for freshman EC, some of the
Clique members revived the University Party, which then
elected its freshman EC nominee and now commands the
enviable position of being unopposed.

Despite this history of instability, the present frame-
work offers the only possible immediate solution to the
dilemma we face: let the nine houses who are presently un-
affiliated with a party join together in opposition to the
Big Clique. The new party would not be close to a major-
ity, but it would have a chance of electing candidates if
they were outstanding nominees. At least such a minority
would prevent the unopposed election of University Party
men, and by opposing, force the party Big Clique to em-
ploy some care in picking its nominees.

If such a new party were formed, it would be a vast
improvement over the status quo. However, the basic
problems of campus politics would remain untouched.
Whereas a two-party system would at least allow the stu-
dent body a real vote, it would not prevent each party
from nominating candidates on the old principle of
“whose turn it is this year” among the houses of the
party. A two-party system cannot prevent campus poli-
ticians from nominating candidates with fraternities in
mind, with Rush Week impressions in mind, instead of
student government in mind.

What is a better answer? We aren't sure. It should be
an answer which holds out as its end effective student
government, rather than the proper schedule for the
gravy train. We appeal to the Executive Committee to
consider a solution. We appeal to students at large to
propose a system which might work fairly. We appeal to
members of the faculty who have known better methods
of electing student governments than the W&L system,
to explain them to students. And finally, we appeal to the
fraternity Clique representatives to reason together to-
ward a more fair political system at W&L.

 

Support for Ariel

One of the best arguments (and possibly there are
few) that the Washington and Lee student body is ser-
iously interested in a liberal arts education, is the exist-
ence of Ariel, its literary magazine. Ariel is W&L’s only
outlet for student literary expression; as student maga-
zines go, faculty members say that it compares favorably
with almost any in the country. It is all the more regret-
table then, that Ariel is on the verge of ceasing publica.
tion because of its lack of support.

To save Ariel, the English Department could con-
ceivably be asked to pitch in with relief. Or, the student
government could be asked to consider granting funds
to Ariel, which has seemed to many to be more worthy
of receiving student body funds than the Southern Col-
legian. These solutions, however, since they would put
Ariel under foreign control, are rightly looked on by the
magazine's editors as last resorts. A student literary pub-
lication should not be under the thumb of the faculty, and
neither should it be subject to the flow of campus polli-
tics,

The very need for such outside support for Ariel
is something of an indictment of the Washington and Lee
student body, The magazine has been published for only
several years; it has consistently contained good work
and it has been edited in good taste. Yet already it is falt-
ering, it is close to failing. Surely we can do better than
this in responding to work of the quality of Ariel. It is
on sale at a number of spots all over the campus; if you
haven't read Ariel, pick up a copy.

“Where Did We Go Wrong???

 

Roy Tyler Replies to Chaplain’s Attack
On School; Says Girls Must Share Blame

ByROY TYLER
Though I have not spent a great
deal of time in the Hollins chapel
in the last two and a half academic
years, I have on occasion, heard Dr.

Alvord Beardslee speak. He is a
rather young man; a man most
everyone would like, and a man

everyone can easily talk to.

His letter to last Friday's Ring-
tum Phi has caused a great deal of
comment, mostly bad, of course,
about what he had to say.

First of all, “The” University, to
Virginians is not always meant to be
the University of Virginia. With this
in mind, let us continue.

My opinion of what Dr. Beardslee
is attempting to do, is a favorable
one. He feels that the grossness and
the immature behavior has gone too
far at Washington and Lee. But, let
me ask one thing, are those who
“ ..vomit inte our chapel, relieve

themselves in our parking lot...”
merely Washington and Lee stu-
dents?

Are there more W&L students who
do this than other students?

Granted, there is a great deal of
behavior that should not go on, but
the fraternities are not, as Dr.
Beardslee implies and has, on other
occasions, said; the source of all
the “trouble.” W&L is a fraternity
school and W&L students contribute
a great deal to the type of “moral
decay” Dr. Beardslee criticizes; but
I have seen students from Virginia
Tech and even some junior colleges
in the area perform some of the
most outlandish acts of repulsion I
have ever seen.

A great deal of the blame, I be-
heve, lies not in fraternities but in
the girls’ schools themselves. There
are certain “groups” of girls who
delight in the activities of the, as Dr.

Beardslee terms them, “...slack-
bellied, loose-lipped golden drunks.”
These girls gather in the dorms be-
hind doors on Sunday night (usually
after hearing Dr. Beardslee at
Chapel) and try and outdo each
other concerning the grossness of
their weekend dates.

These girls are the ones who stand
around and laugh when one of their
friends (who is just not “with it”)
gets a trash can full of garbage
dumped on her head or is bitten by
a “mad” student. The more the girls
think this great comedian’s actions
are, the more he will continue to
perform. He might even request a
a repeat performance which she, of
course, accepts.

But, what if she turns him down?
Is she condemned to attend the Fri-
day and Saturday night showing of

Scene is Washington St. near the
Robt. E. Lee Episcopal church. A
bright pink, ‘65 Porsche glides to

Welcome W&L Alumni. Inside the
car are two people. One is an in-
credibly corpulent man of about
fifty-five, dressed in a sharkskin
suit, Countess Mara tic, Weejuns.
Sitting next to him is a person who
appears to be his twin brother, but
is in reality his son. The boy is
equally fat and similarly dressed,
wearing a pair of thick, chrome-

out of the car, two students ap-
proach, then stop to stare.

Ist Student: Hey, pretty fat beel you

his hand along back fender)

Alum: Fat?

2nd Student: Yeah. Real fat wheels.

Alum: (smiling, putting his hand on
his son’s shoulder) Are you two

Ist Student; No bird. What's the
scoop?

Alum: Gentlemen, my name is Hor-
ace Fabsmacher—W&L ’34—and
this is my son, Leonard. He plans
to attend here next year.

2nd Student: That's close. I’m the
Gnat. This is Booboo,

Alum: How do you do? I brought
Leonard up so he could take a
look at the fraternities and decide
which one is best for him.

Ist Student: Man, you're not sparin’
us any pain at all, are you? Don’t
take offense, but the kid’s got
flies. Nice threads though. Real
tweed. Too bad about the goobs.

WEL-Hollins Study Group

 

Question of the ‘Educated’ Choice Explored

By JOUN KIRKLEY

Why do we come to college?

In the discussion group between
Washington and Lee and Hollins last
Friday night, the
freshmen answer-
ed this question
with reasons like
these: because it’s
expected of us by
our parents and
society; because no
matter what one
wants to do event-
tually, he needs a
college degree to
do it; beeause of
the “earning pow-
degree; because |

er’ of a college

wanted to meet new people who held
ideas different from mine; because I
want to be a doctor (or teacher or
lawyer); because I want to find
something or learn something—the
answer to various questions or prob-
lems.

Note the variety of these answers.
Most of them would probably be
mentioned sooner or later during a

similar discussion—or in ordinary
conversation with any college
ireshman in the country. In faet,

most of us have thought of all these
reasons at one time or another. Yet
most of us will, if pressed, say that
we came here to learn something or
“get an education.” And what is it
that we do learn at college? What

is it that we are actually taught?
We could begin to answer by
enumeration: we learn some history,
some science, some English.... Or
we could say we learn facts; but
to answer the question, “Facts about
what?”, we would probably turn
to the subjects again. Or we might
answer: we learn how to think. How
to handle ideas. And isn’t this really
what we are “supposed” to learn?
Something about points of view.

In English we learn to see a situa-
tion in a novel from the point of
view of each of the main characters,
or to see the novel from the point
of view of a variety of critics. In
sociology we learn the facts that all
men have in common certain biologi-
eal, social, and psychological needs,
but also that different groups of men
(different cultures) go about meet-
ing or satisfying these needs in a
variety of ways. In the sciences we
see that, from practically any theo-
retical problem, there are a variety
of theories purporting to solve it. We
learn that men have held different
philosophies, that there a number of
ways of interpreting history, that
Keynes viewed economic problems
in a way different from Mill. And so
forth

What we learn is this: that for any
given situation or problem there
are a number of solutions or an-
swers. We can approach the problem
from different points of view: and,
depending on what our particula
point of view is, we might solve it
in different ways

But why are we taught this? What
is the orientation, the point of view
that would have this as the goal of
a lengthy educational process?

Isn't the view of man that that
would support this educational goal
something like this: man is essen-
tisily a problem-selving creature
continually thrown into a variety of
sittations which unique and
which involve him in contact with
his world and other persons; and
what he should do in each situation
is perceived thal there are a num-
of ways of thinking or acting or be-
having in this situation; finally, he
should do what is best in each situa-
ton

But then the question each of us
must ask himself is this
that is best te do?

Our culture provides us a great
variety of answers, including many
forms of religious, ethical, moral, or
political fundamentalism, to the
problem we all face: “What is best
to do—here, now?”

We are taught to see the answers,
the variety of possible solutions. But
are we taught how to choose? Can

Charles C. Hart Offers
Congratulations To Us
To the Editor:

Outlined against a star-studded
sky last Tuesday night, the nine
studs of W&L ‘hooped it up. They
are being congratulated on their fine
efforts which teemed with good plays,
and especially for their win over
Old Dominion. The size of the crowd
was truly heartwarming, especially
in view of the fact that the athletic
support is often next to none

Anyway, congratulations boys, you
did it in spite of us

General Grapplers Thrash Loyola, 27-5;
Tankmen Split Meets on Northern Tour

Franklin & Marshall Win;

Drub Loyola

of Baltimore;

End Trip with Loss to AU

Taking a precarious record on the|

road, the Washington and Lee swim-
ming team coached by Norris East-
man soundly trouneed Loyola of
Baltimore, 63-29, in a Friday night
meet only to receive the same treat-
ment themselves the following Sat-
urday afternoon at the hands of
powerful American University
Washington, 58-37.

Although the Generals’ overall rec- |

ord was only esculated, their per-
formance at Loyola in a “big” pool
produced some of the best times ever
in a regulation 25-yard pool.

Against Loyola in the opening
medley relay, Nelson Head did a
fine leg of the 100-yard backstroke
in 1:03 minutes as did his fellow
freshman Kester Denman with a
time of 1:06 in the 100-yard breast-
stroke.

Co-captain Andy Broaddus went
a minute flat for the butterfly and
anchorman Gary Bokinsky wrapped
up the final 100-yard freestyle to
give W&L a lead that was never
threatened. Bart Taylor, usually a
sprinter, followed with a second in
the 200-yard freestyle, while co-
captain Chase won the 50-yard free-
style as did Bill Wildrick in the 200-
yard individual.

Noel Clinnard and Rich Stevens
took second and third in the diving,
and Broaddus followed with a win
in the 200-yard butterfly after his

of |

victorious teammate was disqualified. |
| Next came Bart Taylor, who turned
lin his best time for the 100-yard|
ifreestyle with 55.6.
| Head repeated with a fine time of|
}2:22 in the 200-yard backstroke as|
'did Denman in the 200-yard breast- |
istroke. Bill Wildrick won the 500-!
yard freestyle and Generals’ Broad-
dus, Busse, Clay, and Huston won
the final 400-yard freestyle relays.

Encouraged by the fine perfor-
manees, Coach Eastman looked
hopefully for a repeat against power-
ful American, but the Generals were
flat. The opening medley relay went
uncontended to W&L, but AU.
swept the 200-yard freestyle, the 50-
yard freestyle, 200-yard individual
and diving, thus swamping the Gen-
erals.

W&L managed only one legitimate
first place with Kester Denman in
the 200-yard breaststroke. Bill Wild-
rick lost a close race in the 200-yard
butterfly, and the Generals won the
400-yard freestyle relay via forfeit.

This Saturday the Generals will
conclude their season against weak
Georgetown. It will definitely be a
record day with special attention}
on the 200-yard freestyle or butter-|
fly depending on Wildrick, the 100-
yard freestyle, the 200-yard individ-
ual medley, the 200-yard back-
strocke, and the final 400-yard
freestyle relay.

Last week this column apparentls
1ad a few controversial items in it
I received many comments from
members of the football team and
also from the coaching staff. There
were even comments about my state-
ment that Dick Livingston would be
a big asset on a basketball team of
greater stature than the one for
which he is starring now.

Two former high school players
who participated for the freshman
team two years ago said they thought
I was exaggerating Livingston's abil-
ities. Who am I to argue with
basketball authorities? Anyway, it
is relieving to know that somebody
at least reads this column.

By BOB MAY
Tuesday Sports Writer

The Washington and Lee varsity wrestling team invaded
the North this weekend, splitting two matches to run its rec-
ord to 7-2. Franklin and Marshall handed the W&L matmen
a 14-13 defeat on Friday, but the Generals sprang back a night
later to trample Loyola of Baltimore, 27-5.

At Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Butch West got the Generals
off to a good start with a 6-1 victory*§—————————

the 123 pound class. At 130, however,

10-3. F&M evened the match again
George Schnyder edged Don
Patterson, 3-2. The match remained
even as W&L’s Jamie Andrews and
Chuck Geddes struggled to a 1-1
deadlock.

At 167 co-captain Peter Winfield

ing the W&L grapplers a 13-8 edge.

Profs Play
Minks B-Ball

The Varsity Club at Washington
and Lee under the leadership of its
President, Butch West, will sponsor
the annual Faculty-Student basket-
ball game at 7:30 on the night of
February 22. Each fraternity as well
as the Independent Union will send
one representative to be on the stu-
dent team coached by Gordan Gay,
a member of Delta Tau Delta.

Dr. Shillington will assume his
regular position as coach of the fac-
ulty team which will consist primar-
ily of those members of the academ-
ic faculty who wish to participate;
“those with special talents as show-
men, gamesmanship, or ability are
being especially solicited” says Coach
Lee McLaughlin, who is aiding the
Varsity Club in coordinating the af-
fair.

The price of admission will $1.00
per person, and the proceds will be
employed towards “some pressing
need in the Athletic Department.”
Coach Norman Lord and Buddy
Deaver will serve referees be-
eause of their ability as showmen
well as referees. Although the
Faculty has managed to win in the
past—that is with a litle help from
the referees, the game should prove
amusing and quite enjoyable.

ODK Leadership
Wednesday On Self-Study Plan

(Continued from page 1)

The Self-Study Program has been
designed primarily to allow “an ap-
praisal to be made of the University’s
current strengths and opportunities
for immediate and future improve-
ment,” and also to encourage “recom-
mendations for change to be formu-
lated and implemented now and in
the future.” The program is to last
for approximately eighteen months.

Edward C. Atwood, Dean of

Students and member of the Self-

Study Committee, explained the

program as “a comprehensive sur-

vey of all aspects of Washington
and Lee. It will include not only
the academic field, but also stu-
dent organizations and extracurri-
cular facilities, as well.” Dean At-
wood also made clear the fact that
the program is aimed not only to-
ward immediate change, but also
will hopefully project into the fu-
ture. He stated that “the program

Speaking of names, how about

Coach Joe could do wonders with
that!

to stay at Hollins every weekend be-
cause she can’t find a date who will
be “nice” to her or her friends?
Here, I believe, is the problem.
Do girls have to change their atti-
tude concerning toleration before
the boys will change the actions
they are tolerating? Or will the boys
change their actions, thereby leaving
no reason for the girls to change?
One might as well argue “... what
comes first, the chicken or the egg?”
But merely because fraternities
exist and merely because certain
things which should not go on with-
in them do go on, is no reason for
their dissolvement. A great deal of
the “trouble” encountered by Hol-
lins girls could be avoided by the
girls themselves. If you destroy the
source of the problem, you would
destroy the problem; but you would
have to destroy the student body of
all area colleges, not merely frater-
nities and not merely the W&L stu-
dent body, to destroy the source.

THE LAST HURRAH for 1964 is now an echo. The last Christmas

tree has been piled on a blazing bonfire, and your New Year's reso-
lutions have already had a chance to stand the test of time. One
resolution every alert college man should make (and keep) is to
look his best at all times. With this thought in mind, let’s take a
quick checkup on your mid-winter wardrobe.

CHEST NUTS ROASTING ON AN OPEN FIRE, and you warm and

fashionable in your camelhair sweater—an ideal mid-winter pic-
ture. The camelhair sweater is showing a marked popularity this
year on campuses across the country. And again, cardigans cap top
honors, both in button-front and shawl-collar models, and in smart
border stripes. Look for the new cardigans zipped and border-
striped up the front and leather patched on the

sleeves. A continuing favorite is the Shetland
pullover in soft heathery shades of muted blue, :
brown and tan with a “brushed surface” effect *\.

in both crew and V-neck styles,

WALKIN’ IN A WINTER WONDERLAND, or
skiing down the powdery white slopes, you'll find
the “Ski Look” influence in the HOOT Sweater.
The turtleneck identifies the HOOT. A high-
standing, fold-over turtleneck of rugged rib-
knit, or a “mock” turtle—the high crew-neck—

fs)

    

fives the HOOT a handsome, masculine look.

ileavier, bulkier yarns, and bold patterns, especially the Seandina-
vian designs, are the thing. Brilliant blues, greens, reds and golds
in solid or multi-colored combination stripes and argyles make the
HOOT Sweater an eye-catching invigorating new campus fashion.
HOOT Slacks in tan and bronze corduroy are tapered, trim and
pleatiess, and coordinate perfectly with all ingredients of the HOOT

LOOK.

BABY, IT’S COLD OUTSIDE! But with the proper accessories, you
won't have to worry about the outside weather story. Gloves, often
ignored by college men, are much more than hand-warmers; they
are an integral part of the fashion picture. Sturdy pigskin in the
natural “cork” shade with linings of lambawool or fur are favored
on the cold-weather campus, as are tan knitted wool gioves with
leather palms, Crisp and correct are woolen mufflers in solid colors
or bold Tartan designs, In scarves, the knitted cross-atripes or

border stripes have the edge.
