THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

Friday Edition

 

A Representative Government

In its most decisive meeting this school year, the Executive
Committee proposed a change in the structure of its member-

ship which is long overdue.

If the student government committee is to be truly repre-
sentative of the student body, if it is to have balanced represen-
tation, the proposed amendment to allow the law school only
two members instead of three is a forward step. It seems strange
that a group of 163 students should have three representatives,
whereas a class of 338 students (freshman class) should have

but one representative.

First year law students number 65 and elect one represen-
tative; the freshman class, having 338 members, elects the
same number of Committeemen. The second year law class
has 51 members, while the sophomore class has 388; yet each
class is represented by one EC member. The junior class has
250 members and the senior class, 248; having two represen-
tatives from each of the two classes, simple math shows us

that there is one EC member

However, the third year law class elects one Committeeman
for its 47 members. The unbalanced representation is obvious.

The needed restructure has been caused, not only by the
gross imbalance of representation, but also by the nature of
the law school’s relationship to the rest of the University. The
dissociation of Tucker Hall from the rest of the campus has |
become more and more obvious lately. The fact is that the
law school has a proportionately large representation on the
Executive Committee, even though as a group it has less con-
nection with the life of the University and participates less in
the extra-curricular activities at W&L. Such a situation should

not be allowed to continue.

The situation has worsened in the past few years as the

law school has received more

colleges. The new law students have fewer interests in com-
mon with the undergraduates. Few law students attend under-
graduate activities; almost none concern themselves with under-
graduate problems. Law students are virtually never assimilat-

ed: honor trials are unheard of

Why then should one-third of the Executive Committee
be composed of law students, who represent a group of only
163 students—a group which is for the most part disinterested
in the undergraduate school and mainstream of university life?

We applaud the action of the Executive Committee in pro-
posing the law school amendment to the constitution. Surely
the unbalanced representation of the students’ governing body
is a situation which should be remedied.

Honor System Debate

 

EC Members

JERRY

Senior Law E.C,

‘URNER

Representative

As most W&L students must know by now, it has been

suggested that the permanent e

xpulsion penalty for an honor

system offense should be abolished in favor of a lesser penalty

involving temporary expulsion

, presumably lasting for one

year. In protesting against such a change, I am writing this
article because I sincerely respect and believe in the Honor

System as it now works,

The primary argument for change seems to be based on the
“moral justification’? of the permanent expulsion rule. Yet

the Honor System penalty does not
involve a question of “moral justi-
fication”; it is a matter of student
policy. The students of Washington
and Lee as a matter of policy, not
morality, have set for themselves a
standard of conduct, which forbids
the members of the student body to
lie, cheat, or steal under circum-
stances which concern the student
as a member of this student body.
In other words, this academic society
has set up a code by which each
student must live; if any student de-
liberately chooses not to follow this
code, he is required to leave this
society.
Violators Not Totally Dishonorable
By expelling a student from its so-
ciety, the student body does not
claim or think that the violator is

unfit for any other society, includ-
ing the world at large. Expulsion
under the Honor Syster simply
means that because a violator has
chosen not to live by the rules of}
this society, he is manifestly unfit to
be a member of this society.

But why must this expulsion be
permanent? IT answer that ques-
tion by asking: What can it prove
to allow the violator to return to
W&L? What good can it do? Rick
Carrell has said that it will “allow
the offender to retain his human
worth instead of being branded as
totally dishonorable object.” The
fact is that no one brands the vio-
lator as “totally dishonorable”; no
one denies his human worth. A
society, or student body, has simp-
ly required the student to leave

because the student of his own
choice will not, has not, lived up
to our society's standard.

Carrell has said that many stu-
dents leave the university under the
Honor System because of temporary,

Exposed To Be Highly Successful

By BRUCE W. RIDER
Friday Columnist

Those of us who plan to stay in
school forever and never Get a Job
are continually fascinated by the
little “Placement Notices” appear-
ing from time to time on the ODK)

ful, more fulfilling, than to have
your notice on the ODK board, in-|

Thus far we have held ourselves!

up for an interview with the repre-

| System and are willing to have their)

sons live under it. Our Honor Sys-|
them, therefore, is an essential and!
indispensible part of our life here
at Washington and Lee, because it
protects those mores which are most
valuable to us

Over the past few years, he
noted that there have been a num-
ber of sincere yet misguided efforts
to modify our Honor System. Some
have seught to extend the bounds
of the Honor System and others to |
make it less severe, All so far have
collapsed of their own weight, It is
his personal belief that any change
in the present system would only
serve to weaken it

Wi any the

posed were implemented, it

of changes so lar pro-

would |

lead to the development of a disci-

plinary system rather than an hon-/
or evetem. In reward to Riek Carrell 7
tatement in lest Monday kC
meeting, Dean Gilliam said that Ue
Honor System though oftentime
unduly severe is necessarily so. We
could net have an efleclive system

excuse for its remaining intact, is
nevertheless a testimeny to the
esteem to which former student
generations have held it. He point-
ed out alse that our system is 99

means that 99 per cent of the stu-

the possible 15 per cent that you |

The purpose of the Washington and Lee Honor System ts

primarily to guarantee a spirit

of academic honesty and sec-

ondarily to reinforce every student’s natural penchant for hon-
orable behavior. In order to maintain the integrity of the sys-

tem stiff and impartial penalties

must be assigned to every vio-

lator. The application of these penalties is occasional and
must be recognized as failures of the system: that is, the pur-
pose of the system is to maintain honor not to punish examples

of dishonor, but only the hope

My first paragraph was prompted by
the fact that several weeks ago a

considerable urgency, information
about the show for an article he was
apparently writing. In order to help)
him meet his deadline. I chased the |

the most essential information about

Turner Justifies Honor Penalty

(Continued from page 2)

but very strong, pressures, and in
his opinion such a student is worthy
of W&L after a length of time. But
what effeet will temporary expul-
sion have? Does temporary expul-
sion mean that a violator can, and
in faet will, build up a resistance
to pressure while he is absent
from the University? I see nothing
in expulsion, temporary or other-
wise, which would in itself create
any interresistnce. Temporary ex-
pulsion provides no assurance what-
soever that this one-time offender
will not again violate our trust. As
a matter of fact, Columbia’s research
of Academic Dishonesty and Its Con-
trol in College has found by survey
that out of the total number of
those people who cheat, “there are
at least as many repeaters as one-
time offenders.”
One-Year Expulsion

Moreover, if I correctly under-
stand the proposed change, the one
vear expulsion rule would apply to
all first-time offenders (because of
the inequity of any possible distine-
tion). But these first offenders vio-
lated the trust of every W&L stu-
dent, Can we reasonably allow this
person to return here where trust
is paramount? That student made
his decision to live outside of our
trust, or beliefs, and our code.

It is apparent that a one-year ex-
pulsion rule has but one aim—to
punish the violator. This idea of
punishment, however, does not be-
long in our Honor System. We do
not seek to punish, but rather to
maintain our standards by exclud-
ing those who have not lived ac-
cording to our code. If the purpose
of the Honor System were to pun-
ish violaters, a fine or perhaps lower
grades would suffice. But punish-
ments could never assure us that
the violator will not fall below the
standard again, whereas permanent
expulsion does, because it removes

the student to another society whose
standards may not be so high as
ours.

As to Mr. Hartin’s statement that
honor is not absolute, I offer my
opinion that the absoluteness of this
Honor System lies in the fact that
conduct is either above or below
that standard which I mentioned in
my second paragraph. Within W&L’s
society conduct below the required
standard is absolutely dishonorable.
Again no one is saying that a vio-
lation of our code implies or man-
fests that the violator is dishonor-
able outside of our society.

Finally, even if we assume that
a few instances of injustice occur
under our Honor System (although
I know of no such instances), are
we justified in tampering with this
Honor System which has maintained
a lengthy record of outstanding suc-
cess: the many benefits of a suc-
cessful Honor System have remained
with W&L through many years and
many problems.

Don’t misunderstand me. I am not
fighting change as such, But change
should never be made without re-
gard to the risk involved. One ques-
tion remains: can we, in view of the
dubious benefits of this proposed
change risk the outstanding success
and innumerable benefits of our
Honor System.

Carrell Calls
System ‘Harsh’

(Continued from page 2)

The Columbia Universiiy Survey
on cheating suggests that in lessen-
ing the severity of punishment for
cheating the incidence
rises. In view of the usual definition
of “lenieney” in this context—ad-
monishment by the appropriate dean,
flunking the course involved, being
placed on academic probation, ete.—
a one year suspension with the ac-
companying stigma can hardly be
considered lenient.

No, he hasn't. Therefore one might
question his ability to make a judg-

much more than a place to study;
it is a place where one makes life-

The Dartmouth tournament

Since then, four more freshmen)

Simmons, Jud Simmons, Bob Imholt,
and Corbet Bryant, who tied for first

The team’s next contest will take

long friends, socializes, eats, sleeps,
and yes, even drinks.

I am glad that Mr. Beardslee has
had “experience” with fraternities
at Lehigh, I would like him to clarify
exactly what first-hand experience
he has had with fraternities at W&L.
Evidently, he judges our fraternities
by the students who relieve them-
selves in the Hollins parking lot
and vomit in his chapel. Should this
very small minority be used to judge
our fraternities? I don’t really think
so. Another source of his misinfor-
mation sems to be from second-hand
evidence. If

reports or hear-say
Mr. Beardslee had taken the time
to visit some of our fraternities,

perhaps he wouldn't have been so
critical, After all, Hollins isn’t more
than fifty miles away, and the time
spent in visiting W&L would have
been well worth the price of not be-
ing so obviously misinformed.

Even after this prejudiced attack,
I’m sure that any fraternity on cam-
pus (even Phi Kappa Psi) would be
glad to have Mr. Beardslee as a

Gilliam Sees W&XL Unity Loss

(Continued from page 2)

some forty of fifty students. Thus
when the veterans returned to W&L
they made up the largest percentage
of the student body. His fear was
that these men, many of them 24 or
25 years old, might consider an honor
system somewhat corny or immature
and therefore vote it out. He was
thrilled, however, when these men
proved to be the system’s strongest
supporters.

Leaving the Honor System and
turning to the speaking tradition
and conventional dress, Dean Gil-
liam commented that, in contrast
to the Honor System, they are not
indispensible. They are, however, an
extremely valuable part of Washing-
ton and Lee.

Thes traditions grew up follow-
ing World War I. At the time there
was no need for enforcing them,
You spoke to everyone because
you knew them, and you wore a
coat and tie at all times because
leisure wear was not popular
among students. To look through
a Calyx of no more than ten years
ago, he said, you will notice that
the only time students are not
wearing a coat and tie is when

 

they are in athletic gear, It is cer-
tainly not the same today. |

Dean Gilliam attributes the gener- |
al decline in the observance of
these traditions to a number of fac-
tors. Most obvious of these reasons
is that our student body is now
larger and more individualistic than
at any time in the past. The unity
that once existed among the students
here is no longer present. Dean Gil-,
liam remarked that, in the “old
days” no one left Lexington except

for Christmas and summer vacations
and that fraternity meetings were
held at eleven o’clock on Saturday
nights.

Though times have changed, he
nevertheless feels that there is a
great deal of value still to be gained
from maintaining our speaking and
dress traditions. He believes them to
be a very valuable element of Wash-
ington and Lee, Many times over the
past thirty-nine years that he has
been with Washington and Lee, he
has been told that we have the
friendliest and best-dressed body of
students anywhere. Holding on to
this image certainly seems worth-
while, yet the present student body
has allowed it to slide. This is not
totally to their discredit, however,
for the thoughtful appraisal which
our traditions have been given is the
healthy sign of a reflective and con-
cerned student body. Still Dean Gil-
liam finds it hard to remain im-
partial when W&L’s traditions are
brought into question, “I only wish
I knew,” he said, “of some magic
formula which could be used to re-
store them.”
