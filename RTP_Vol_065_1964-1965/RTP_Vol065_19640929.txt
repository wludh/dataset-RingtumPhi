Endorse Ticket ©

The Johnson-Humphrey ticket re-

ceived an overwhelming endioree~|
ment from the Washington and Lee |
Young Democrats at the organiza-|

tion’s first meeting last week.

There was only one dissenting vote
as the W&L Young Democrats gave
a vote of confidence to the entire
Democratic ticket, including John-
son, Humphrey, and Virginia candi-
dites Harry Flood Byrd and Rep-

resentative Jack Marsh from this
District.
A compezign committee to push

the Johnson candidecy was appoint-
ed under the leadership of sopho-
msre Dave Mayfield. Bruce Me-
Ke'then, a Kappa Sig, was eppoint-
ed chairman of a committe to push a
mem ership drive. McKeithen re-
quesied that students interested in
jeining the club and working for
the Johnson ticket contact him at the |
Kappa Sig house. Freshmen are
asked to contact Steve Smith, Young
Democrat President, in room 489 of
the old Freshman Dormitory.

The Young Democrats are a
younger organization on campus
tha neither the Young Republicans
or the Conservative Society. Com-
pared to the Young Republicans,
they also are small and compara-
tively quiet. This fact indicates that
so far, Washington and Lee students |
lean heavily toward Goldwater's!
conservative philosophy. The W&L
Democrats face also the obstacle of

organization, since Senator Byrd has
not to date endorsed the Johnson
candidacy.

Steve Smith stated that the Dem-
ocrats’ next meeting, to be held!
after further campaign plans are
formulated and materials arrive!
from Washington, will be announced
on the ODK board.

recent Staunton appearance as a
good sign.

The rise of James Brown and his
group has indeed been phenominal.
Srown was born and raised in Ma
con, Ga. As a young man he tried
both boxing and professional base-
ball until a knee injury forced him
to give up sports. Brown still claims
that his agility at hopping around
| the stage is due to his boxing train-
ing. Soon he joined a Negro gospel
group, and became so well known
for his musical talents that he was
able to form his own band.

In 1956 Brown’s group cut its
first record, “Please, Please, Please.”
The Record was a smash in the

| Macon area and did manage to at-

tract the attention of Syd Nathan of
King Records. From that point on
the story of James Brown and the
Flames is one success after another.
“Hold My Baby’s Hand” and “Fine
Old Foxy Self” were two more of
Brown's earlier, raunchier hits.
During the early 60’s “Try Me” and
“Mashed Potatoes U.S.Afl” kept him
on the hit list. In 1963 he made his
famous first appearance at the Apol-
lo Theater in Harlem. This memor-
able performance has often been
compared to the Ray Charles Atlanta
concert. The show was recorded and
has been Brown's best selling album.

Backing up the lead singer will
be the famous Flames. This trio in-
cludes Lloyd Stallworth, Bobby
Bennett, and Bobby Byrd. Byrd
holds the distinction of being the
only original Flame “still burning.”

There are a number of sidelights
to Brown's group that may be on
hand for the concert. Among the
more well know are T.V. Mama and
“gorgeous Tammy Montgomery.”

All these attractions and others
besides should make the Saturday
night concert at Openings a con-
cert that will be talked about for
a long time. Members of the dance
board remind students that dance
| plans are still available.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Tuesday Edition
Endorses Johnson

When the Washington and Lee Mock
Convention nominated Barry M. Goldwater
as its predicted Republican presidential nomi-
nee, the possibility of Goldwater’s eventually
winning the GOP nomination seemed remote
to the “experts.” In fact, the Washington and
Lee choice was so much scorned by the news
media that it was difficult to get publicity about
the nomination. That was on May 5; the an-
alysts were predicting that Goldwater would
lose the crucial California primary, and that
a moderate candidate would bear the Repub-
lican standard. Then came the Goldwater
miracle in California, and with that one pri-
mary, the nomination of the Republican Party
belonged to the man they had said couldn’t
couldn’t win it. Washington and Lee’s Mock
Convention was confirmed—the others proved
wrong—but at what cost?

What cost might it be to the United States
that the Republican Party is now under the
leadership of a man who day after day, while
campaigning for the White House, demon-
strates a lack of any basic understanding of
the realities of governing a nation and of in-
ternational politics? The Tuesday edition be-
lieves that the cost is no less than the possibil-
ity of destruction by nuclear warfare; that
Barry Goldwater casts the terrifying shadow
of nuclear war—that is, total annihilation.
This is why Senator Goldwater must be de-
feated, and by a decisive vote. This is why the
people of the United States must elect Lyndon
B. Johnson, a man who has proved himself
a great leader not only in many years of leg-
islative service, but also in a brilliant ten
months of achievement as President.

The Basis of Decision

The choice in foreign policy between
Johnson and Goldwater is a clear one, and it
is on this choice that the Tuesday edition
urges the defeat of Senator Goldwater. Inter-
national statesmanship must now rank as the
principal issue in any national election, be-
cause one serious mistake in foreign relations
could well relieve the nation of the necessity
of any domestic policy whatever. The choice
between Johnson and Goldwater is the choice
between a steady defense of United States
interests while working toward a gradual ac-
ceptance of co-existence (the original Ken-
nedy strategy) ; and on the other hand, Gold-
water’s policy of aggressive commitment to
“the reduction of Communist power to a level
from which it cannot threaten the security of
our nation or the peace of the world.” Gold-
water’s dreamy ideas of defeating the Com-

“In Your Heart You Know He’s Right”

Goldwater Wants Strength To Insure Peace

munists force us to the conclusion that a vote
for Johnson is the only reasonable alternative;
it is simply absurd to think that one nuclear
power can reduce another to impotence. This
is not “peace through strength,” as the Sena-
tor puts it—it is an invitation to self-annihila-
tion through thick-headedness.

A Lack of Grasp

Senator Goldwater’s failures in foreign
policy thinking seem to stem from a miscon-
ception of the world of today—a world in
which either of the two powers which domi-
nate the world, could and would destroy the
other if it believed its vital interests to be at
stake. In the atomic age, the power struggle
is at a kind of stalemate, since neither power
can consider war as a rational possibility; each
side must respect the other’s capability of de-
stroying the world. The reasonable solution
to tension and to the possibility of nuclear
warfare, is tolerance, negotiation, and the rec-
ognition of at least the bare facts of mutual
interest. This does not mean that the United
States can tolerate Communist encroachment
on its interest—but it does mean that this
country cannot make the mistake of pretend-
ing that only American ideals are fit to sur-
vive, and that we therefore must commit our-
selves to destroying the Soviet system. And
yet this is precisely the Goldwater philoso-
phy—either “we win” or “they win.” To
Goldwater there are only these two alterna-
tives. He does not see that either of these al-
ternatives would mean nuclear warfare; that
his position is precisely the one which will
ensure that neither nation can survive, much
less “win.” The Senator doesn’t realize that
sometimes even the United States must be will-
ing to be patient, to listen to people the world
over, to tolerate the ideals of other people—
no matter how repugnant those ideals may
be to Americans. In contrast to Goldwater’s
naive dreams of victory over the Commun-
ists, the Democrats present an administration
which perhaps has made mistakes on occasion,
but one which has approached each dilemma
with a sense of responsibility and an awareness
that the United States must be strong enough
to preserve world peace, yet wise enough to
restrain its strength for the same purpose,

at times.
Leadership In Diplomacy
A lack of grasp of the Cold War is not
Senator Goldwater's only failure as a leader
in foreign policy. Perhaps even more import-
ant are the Senator’s shortcomings in the abili-
ties of diplomacy. No man can with reason

impugn Goldwater’s honesty, his courage, and
his sincerity in fighting for his ideals. In fact,
for most, Goldwater’s open and likeable char-
acter contrast somewhat favorably with the
politician’s makeup which is evident in John-
son’s public personality. Yet unfortunately, by
the same token that he is frank enough to
say what he thinks and mean it, Goldwater is
reckless enough to act without reflecting on
what he is doing. In international relations
there is no longer time for second thoughts,
for modification in careless statements. And
Senator Goldwater has shown a dangerous re-
liance on second thoughts and belated expla-
nations—even during the present campaign.
This potentiality for careless action is the one,
perhaps the only characteristic which a head
of the state absolutely must not possess today.
It is one of which President Johnson cannot
be accused. Lyndon Johnson has earned only
respect as a leader able to uphold the interests
of the free world and at the same time to main-
tain the fine balance of international relations
which is so ready to teeter, to plunge into the
abyss of war. President Johnson has already
proved his abilities in a serious crisis—but
Barry Goldwater has shown himself unfit to
be entrusted with such responsibility.
An Unrealistic Attitude

To be specific in the condemnation of
Goldwater’s foreign policy positions, his ex-
pression very recently that it makes no dif-
ference who wins the Sino-Soviet conflict
illustrates the most dangerous ignorance of
the simple principles of realistic politics. Gold-
water shows himself unwilling to exploit op-
portunity, unable to recognize a possible ally,
unable to weaken an enemy by diplomatic
moves—in sum the Senator shows us an as-
tonishing vacancy in the realm of political
realism. His inability to deal with peoples who
reject Americanism is an inability to realize
the fact that among countries which are unlike
the United States, there can be both friends
and enemies. Goldwater has a boyish faith in
the American system which borders on chau-
vinism and smacks of intolerance. His combi-
nation of idealism and intolerance is his rea-
son for a long history of voting against foreign
aid, which he denounces variously as “ill-con-
ceived” or “global welfarism.”

It is an attitude which leads Goldwater to
speak favorably of the withdrawal of diplo-
matic recognition from the Soviet Union. The
Senator advocates that the United States gov-
ernment announce that it “does not regard

Mr. Khrushchev’s murderous clique as the

W&L Mock Convention Was Right--Too Right

legitimate ruler of the Russian people or of
any other people.” To put Goldwater in the
White House—to give him the power of mak-
ing such a colossal mistake—might put a
deadly strain on the balance of world peace.
It might also put a serious strain on the mem-
bers of the free world; and it would deeply
alienate many neutral nations.

“Marines and Brinkmanship”

But the Senator plunges ahead, speaking
now of liberating Eastern Europe, now of
winning the war with North Viet Nam. His
recommendation that the President send the
marines into Cuba is nothing unusual for
Goldwater. His plans for victory are as anti-
quated as they are wild. He often refers to
the policies of John Foster Dulles as a model,
and intimates that he might attempt to em-
ploy “‘brinkmanship” as an ultimatum to the
Communists. He might attempt to enforce
peace by threatening war. This is a method
which in the hands of an impulsive man such
as Senator Goldwater, might very well lead
us to war; and war between nuclear powers
is not a rational consideration. Even if initial
conflicts are not fought with nuclear weapons,
the danger of escalation stands at the elbow
of such “conventional” warfare. A demand
for victory over an opponent which possesses
nuclear weapons and a delivery system, is
nothing else but a demand for self-annihila-
tion. And in the end, this is the possible cost
to Americans for voting for Barry Goldwater
for president.

At the moment, President Johnson seems
assured of victory over the Senator from
Arizona. However, this is not the first time
Senator Goldwater has been counted out by
the pollsters and the experts. Not long ago
he was considered a “fringe” representative
who could not possibly win the Republican
nomination. This attitude produced a certain
complacency in the hearts of moderate Repub-
licans—who shortly suffered a very rude
awakening. The next five weeks must not see
the Democratic Party caught napping at the
switch; in the face of Senator Goldwater's
frenzied backing there must be no complac-
ency. Now, if ever, is the time for the Amer-
ican democracy to prove to itself and to the
world, that it will accept only responsible
leadership. Lyndon Johnson must be given
an overwhelming vote of confidence; and
equally important, Barry Goldwater must be
beaten so badly that he and his followers
will be unable to return for a repeat perfor-
mance in 1968. America has no other choice.

By BILL BURKE

Senator Goldwater's foreign policy
is PEACE, PEACE through strength.
The best way to AVOID war is to
remain strong. Since 1961 not a single
new weapons system has been inau-
gurated. Senator Goldwater has
stated, “if we follow the phased
weakness of the present administra-
tion, I very much fear that we may

the Korean War and as the Johnson
Administration is doing now! Ap-
peasement has led us to war before,
will it again? This is not to say
Senator Goldwater wants to pre-
pare for war—but rather so we will
not have to appease the aggressors
and we can avoid war.

Results of a Weak Foreign Policy

1. Cuba remains Communism's
open door to Latin America. The
Johnson Administration openly ad-|
mits it has failed to enforce its re-
strictions on shipping to Cuba. Cuba)!
is now opening exporting arms,
propaganda and saboteurs to other|
nations in Latin America.

2. The shameful Berlin Wall)

who was tigger happy in the latest
Gulf of Tonkin incident. Two weeks
ago a US. warship fired on five
unidentified vessels in the Gulf of
Tonkin and sank three. This was
done under the express command of
President Johnson. Previously the
United States Navy has not made a
policy to fire at blips on a radar
screen. Who was trigger happy?

2. President Johnson has called
Senator Goldwater a warmonger
simply because he suggested that,
Supreme Commander
ought to be given some sort of con-
tingency authority for using tactical
nuclear weapons.” It was disclosed
last week that they already had this
authority directly delegated from

policy directed towards winning the
war.

Soon all the freshmen were hanging

Later in the same period W&L

After three unsuccessful

pass from center on a attempted

on the short end of the score, the
game statistics showed that W&l

downs than did the Jackets.

Other than Barclay, who may be

Kirkpatrick, Henry Score Goals;
Coach Lyles Praises Team Unity

By BOB CARTER
Tuesday Sports Writer

Washington and Lee opened its 1964 soccer at home with
a fine 2-1 victory over Pfeiffer College. W&L failed to score
until the third quarter when left inside Dave Kirkpatrick headed
the ball for a score after Tim Henry had booted a penalty
kick called on the Pfeiffer goalie for taking more than four
steps. The second W&L goal was scored by center forward

*Tim Henry on a screen shot in the
fourth period.

Pfeiffer’s only goal came in the
fourth period when center forward
David Smith scored on a short pass
when W&L goalie Bob Larus was
out of position.

Coach Lyles had high praise for
backs Howard Busse, David Red-
mond, and Pete Preston for
the fine defensive game they played.
Wes Horner and Dave Kirkpatrick
| led the line play. Coach Lyles com-
mented, “The passing of Pfeiffer was
good but W&L had better shots. The
Generals better condition and team
unity were decisive factors in the
victory.”

Lack of Depth

No starters return from last year’s
team. Although the first team is
good, the team’s biggest problem
seems to be a lack of depth. Coach
Lyles is helping solve the problem
by using several players from the
freshman team. Slated to see a lot of
action is foreigner John Van Bork
from Amsterdam, Netherlands who
is a freshman this year.

 

 

 

 

The biggest and most important
game of the season is Tuesday,
Sept. 29 against Lynchburg College

on the home field. The outcome of
this game will prove to be an indi-
cation of the rest of the season.

WHY
WE
CARRY
GANT

There's more than fabric superiority in Gant. In addi-
tion, ‘‘needied-into the warp and woof of every Gant
shirt" — there's flair-fit show — three vital inher-
ents that make all the difference when a man wears
a Gant,

We chose Gant because they take shirt making serl-
ously. They're hard to please (like we are) when it
comes to fit of collar, its roll, its profile—how much
it shows above the suit collar, They're fastidious
about the way the body of the shirt drapes and folds.
All must integrate to achieve that viable ingredient
which gives comfort and aplomb. In substance, Gant
shirts are keyed to the discerning tastes of well
groomed men who appreciate quality. These men are
our customers.

Old Reid Hall
Is Remodeled

For Journalism

The remodelling of Reid Hall,
which seniors remember as the old
Physics building, has been complet-
ed. Renovation o fthe building that
now houses the journalism depart-
ment began in October of 1963. The?
project was financed primarily by
alumni donations, no costs figures|
have been released.

 

The three story building provides!
space and modern facilities for all
the journalism department’s activi-)
ties. The second floor serves as the
center of instruction with a large,
one hundred seat auditorium; a
seminar room; student lounge; and
a library.

The first and third floors house |
the facilities which enable students |
to gain proficiency in journalism and
communications. These are a pho-
tography lab, a print shop, three
broadcasting room and a _ control
room, a mail room newspaper of-
fice and an advertising lab.

The new facilities for journalism
have provided the History and Eng-
lish departments with badly needed
elbow room. The History department
has taken over the old print shop,
placing three of its offices and a
classroom there, and the English de-/|
partment has moved into the first
floor of Payne Hall.

Letters To The Editor

For years student government at
Washington and Lee has been con-
trolled by various selfish factions.
At the end of last year ten frater-
nities combined to form the Liberal

Party. These ten fraternities asso-|———~

ciated together for the sole pur-
pose of gaining the prestige of hav-
ing one of their own brothers put
into office. The Executive Committee
appoints other committees, and thus
EC snowballs into
mountains of prestige for all the fra-
ternities belonging to the party in
control.

Another party, the Progressive
Party, is smaller but still has the
same selfish motives. At last report
this party was controlled by five

| fraternities.

The time has come for the fresh-
man class to abandon the corruption
of these big political machines. Self-
ish motives have no place on the
E.C. I urge all freshmen, fraternity
members and non-fraternity mem-
bers alike, to abandon this “time-
honored tradition.” It is a disgrace to
the integrity of the Washington and
Lee student body, and will remain
so as long as we allow it.

Let’s prevent the important posi-
tions of the Executive Committee
from being made into footballs of
prestige for these various selfish
factions. I urge you, the class of
1968. to vote for the independent
