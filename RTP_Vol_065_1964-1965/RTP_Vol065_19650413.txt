In announcing his candidacy, Les
iid that he feels that as an inde-
pendent candidate, he will not be
obligated to any group or faction
and will be able to represent a
breader section of the student body

Summing up his views, the can-
didate said, “I feel that a student |
can run successfully as an inde |
pendent in a broadly-based, non-
fraternity-dominated political sys-
tem. Not only does this transfer

more initiative to the student body,
it also gives them more of a voice
in an invigorating, active student
government,”

Neely Young says that he has en-
tered the race for secretary because
he that “this position in the
student body is too important to be
a clique.” He feels that
for the EC should go
unopposed as a matter of principle.

Young has been consistently on
Dean's List and Honor Roll, and
was chosen for Phi Eta Sigma his
freshman year. He now serves as
Vice-President of Phi Eta Sigma,
as a fraternity officer, and as chair-
man of the UCA’s Community
Service Committee.

By Tuesday Staff
Thursday’s elections, testing
the new University Party in
campus elections for the first
time, remain in question to-

day despite the apparent dis-
unily of its opponents.

The Party slate, which at first was
faced only at one position—that of
president, with Fred Mindel running
running against Party candidate
Chuck Walker— now is opposed for
vice president and secretary.

Bob Lee, running independently
against Party candidate Dave Mar-
chese for vice president, by all po-
litical talk has a chance to upset the
Party. Neely Young, the last candi-
date to declare and apparently some-
thing of a protest candidate, is re-
garded as having almost no possible
chance to upset the Party’s Joe

The race between Mindel and
Walker for the top office is the most
actively contested and is looked upon
by many as the closest. If the Party
cannot elect Walker, regarded as a
nominee for the presidency not only
this year but last year, it will be in
serious trouble trying to preserve a
Party ine in upcoming class elections.

History of Flux

The political order on campus is
currently in a state of flux from
which it seems unlikely to stablize
itself. In order to understand the
president dilemma look at the re-
cent history of campus politics is es-
sential.

It was in the spring of 1963 that
the traditional party composition
was fundamentally altered. At that
time the old University Party and
the now xtienct Independent Party

a totally new alliance called the Pro-
gressive Party. The nine houses left
out of this new party pulled them-
selves together under the banner of
the old University Party.

The Progressive Party enjoyed a
majority position in campus elec-
tions for the next year, although it
failed to solve the problem of clique
dominated polities, i.e., satisfying its
member houses. Once again in the

 

Campus Political T
Promises Unique Election

   

spring of 1964 both political parties
were destroyed by internal riffs. For
several fraternities this split result-
ed in a complete rejection of campus
political parties in general and the
clique system specifically.
Liberty Party

Following the elections last spring
the Liberty Party was formed with
the expressed intention of eliminat-
ing the evils inherent in the clique
system. It was this party, consisting
of ten houses, which was unable to

survive even one election. In the
ruins of the Liberty Party a new
coaliation which very much resem-

bled the original University Party
managed to sweep freshman EC
election of last fall.

Thursday's election centers on a
contest between the only organized
political party on campus, the Uni-
versity Party, and independent op-

position. In political science termin-
ology there exists a rather signifi-
cant power vacuum in the present
sSlal

of affairs

NOTICE

Tonight, at 7:30, the Independent

The extent of this vacuum can only
be determined by the outcome of this
election. It is safe to say that a one-
party system does not necessarily
create a health ypolitical climate.

The presidential contest promises
to focus attention on a conflict be-
tween progressives and conservative
elements of the student body. Walker
relying on old line houses and the
Law School, and Mindel the inde-

pendents and remaining fraternities

. Although this is definitely an over-

simplification it points out the gen-
eral nature of the campaign. Walker:
will probably rely on strong sup-
port not only from his own party,
but also the law schol and certain
independent groups. Mindel must
concentrate on the fraternities which
have renounced any party affiliation
as well as on seattered support from
individuals within the University

Party and the law school

The crucial issue involved in the

campaign of the vice presidential
candidates is the Honor System. In

The Qualifications, The Issues

As former president Eisenhower said of last fall’s
national election, “It’s confusing.” For the first time with-
in memory the perennial majority party, the University
Party is unopposed by any semblance of an opposition
party. Yet strangely, the result is that without the threat
of an opposition ticket, the Party voters seem to be ex-
aming individual qualifications to an unusual degree—at
least in the elections which are being contested by inde-
pendent candidates.

Despite the dampening effect on the campaign which
has been caused by the absence of a contest for one of
the four offices, the top three spots are being sought
hotly. No office and particularly neither of the top two
positions, is in the University Party bag, although the
Party candidates certainly have the advantage in organ-
ization. Because individual qualifications are so important,
the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi feels justified in presenting an
analysis of the qualifications of the four men running
for president and vice president of the student body.

A student newspaper must be a commentator on the
facts, as well as a reporter of them. At times, our com-
ment has aroused little interest in the student body; at
other times we have stirred up strong objection. But
throughout the year our policy has been to present issues
as we have seen them, regardless of the currents of ma-
jority opinion. It is on such an occasion as a campus elec-
tion that the newspaper should be most vocal. A news-
paper must not make the mistake of cherising impartiality
to the point of ineffectuality.

The race for the presidency is between two men who
have served well together as junior class EC representa-
tives. Chuck Walker, Kappa Sigma, is an Honor Roll
and Dean’s List student who is completing his second
year on the EC. His soundness as an EC member, with
his high grades, have made Walker an obvious, even a
groomed choice fo rthe Party nomination all along. Walk-
er is highly qualified on the basis of campus activities: he
is a varsity cross-country runner, a member of SWMSFC
and Liberty Hall Society, was the IFC outstanding Fresh-
man in 1963; and his honoraries include the economics
and commerce fraternities and Phi Eta Sigma.

Fred Mindel, Zeta Beta Tau, was the first candidate to
declare himself in opposition to the Party. The fact that
he was not pushed into the race by his fraternity nor by
any organization, attests to Mindel’s initiative; as do his
record on the EC and his platform. He is a Dean’s List
student, a varsity basketball player, was a Mock Con-
vention state chairman, and is a member of ODK, the
student Service Society and Liberty Hall Society.

Mindel’s main attractiveness is that he represents a
spirit of enthusiasm in student government, something
which has long been lacking here. The general apathy
which now greets the EC at every turn cannot be all the
fault of the student body; some of it, if not most of it,
must be laid to the EC’s failure to assume initiative. Min-
del’s conviction that the students will support an active
leadership on the part of the EC is refreshingly idealistic.
It compares favorably with Walker's quietly capable but
stolid attitude; it is what gives Mindel a chance to upset
the Party in this election, and it is what moves the Ring-
tum Phi to endorse Mindel’s candidacy.

The difference between these two able men is that
Walker represents the Old Guard, and Mindel the new.
In EC debate throughout the year this has been the sit-
uation: Walker defending the status quo, and Mindel
seeking new solutions to old problems. Walker is in the
line of Jim Kulp, Bill Noell, and Tim Ireland, the last
three student body presidents; certainly he would not dis-
associate himself from such old line leaders as these, even
if he could. These are the men who have made our student
government what it is. Mindel, on the other hand, presents
a fresh approach. His platform contains some of his new
ideas and other than that his EC recod supports his stand
as a man with a new attitude: that the EC must seek out
the answers in areas it ha sneglected in the past, and that
it is the president who will lead the search for answers.

Mindel’s appeal rests also with the fact that his ap-
proach just happens to fit with the changing face of Wash-
ington and Lee. The University is on the threshhold of
great advances in every way; it is Mindel who would fit
into the picture of such progress. Walker, though a fine
defender of the qualities the school already has, cannot
match Mindel in guiding the student body forward.

Mindel’s record on the EC gives credibility to his
statements and his platform of dynamic leadership. He
had the originality earlier this year to poll the class he
represents on issues he felt he might be voting on during
the year. The EC debate he has been consistent in sup-
porting ideas for improvement; but his ideas for change
have always been tempered with regard for the benefits
of the existing structure.

Judging from past year,s camapign platforms mean
little at W&L; but Mindel’s platform, if it means anything,
much better than the Party platform. The
Party platform is actually weaker than last year's Party
platform. With Mindel’s enthusiasm for what he is stand-

is a good one

THE RING-TUM PHI

Opponents Clash On Issues

 

Top Candidates Make Election Statements

Fred Mindel

Candidate for President

In the Presidential election, there
will be a clear-cut choice betwen
my attitude, perspective, and E.C.
record and those of my opponent,
Chuck Walker. This difference in our
attitudes toward the principle of “ac-
tive representation,’ (where E.C.
seeks out, expresses, and carries out,
when called for, student consensus)
as well as our fundamental disparity
in general frame of mind, may be
clearly and concisely illuminated by
our actions on the E.C. this year.
Four specific points should sufficient-
ly in dicate this distinet difference.

1) Despite my relating the results
of a questionnaire I distributed with-
in the Junior Class (which on the
subject of Conventional dress showed
almost the same percentage of dissat-
isfied students as the school-wide
referendum) and my urging that we
further investigate this area before
approving a Convention Dress policy,
my opponent still voted positively
to adopt a policy which totally ne-
glected this majority sentiment. I
voted negatively.

2) In subsequent discussion on how
to interpret the Conventional Dress
referendum, my opponent refused
to support in discussion or give more
than token lip service to the fact that
although no specific modifications
could be made at the time, never-
theless a majority of those who voted
expressed dissatisfaction. This meant
to me that further and more specific
investigation was not only warrant-
ed, but mandatory.

3) During discussion of a proposed
change in election procedure, my
opponent openly stated before the
E.C. that “the student body as a
whole is not capable of choosing its
own candidates.” I strongly disagreed
in supporting the proposed amend-
ment requiring open nominating con.
ventions, stating that I did fee}
that W&L students were capable of
making their own choice and that
they must be given this opportunity

4) Despite his lack of faith in our
student body to choose its own can.
didates, my opponent voted in favor
of the proposed amendment which
required open nominating conven-
tions. This proposal passed the E.C,
almost unanimously and was favor-
ed more than 2 to 1 by those voting
in the referendum, though it failed to
receive the needed majority to be
put into effect. A motion was made
during the next E.C. meeting to re~
submit the proposal, and now my
opponent voted negatively. Had he
mentioned in his discussion that he
had subsequently found flaws in the
proposal or had somehow come to
believe that it was no longer feas-
able or possible, his negative vote
would have been justified. I do not
believe his comment on why he now
opposed the same plan he only a
few weeks earlier favored, “because
he had never heard of a precedent

(Continued on page 3)

Chuck Walker
Candidate for President

This nomination comes to me as a
high honor and I deeply appreciate
it. To demonstrate my appreciation
I feel it is incumbent upon me to
seek election purely on the basis
of the validity of my past service to
Washington and Lee and the validity
of the proposals I am_ presenting.
The only sincerely approach, I feel,
is one based on the critical examina-
tion of every aspect of Washington
and Lee life and on the willingness
to analyze and correct deficiencies
of that life while attempting to pre-
serve the unique ideals and heritage
of this university.

If experience is of any value as a
qualification for this office, I have
served Washington and Lee for three
years. I personally feel that it has
benefited me a great deal. Of more
importance, however, I hope to bring
before the Student Body certain
ideas and proposals that are more
than abstract campaign promises.

A Dynamic Leadership Forum

In this spirit, | am proposing a
more dynamic role for the ODK
Leadership Forum. This organization
has done yeoman service in the past
by sponsoring discussion on vital is-
sues affecting Washington and Lee.
I wish to see this body strengthen-
ed. It should be open to any stu-
dent who wishes to protest on a
particular issue or to bring up a
problem for consideration; it should
be able to collect all the necessary
data bearing on a problem so that
it may make a comprehensive and
coherent report o fits findings; and it
should present such information to
the Executive Committee for possible
executive action.

It should be concerned primarily
with finding the vital issues and
problems in our campus life, for the
Executive Committee, because of its
other duties, cannot efficiently serve
this need. I wish to make the ODK
Leadership Forum a legitimate ve-
hicle of student protest, a means of
bringing the best minds in the Stu-
dent Body to bear on the problems
that face this university. I believe
that this will encourage student re-
sponsibility, broaden the quality and
quantity of effective student lead-
ership ,and embody a practical so-
lution to offset the frustration ac-
companing student protests and
discussion.

Freshman Dormitory Committee

I also propose a new Freshman
Dormitery committee, made up of the
Head Dorm Counselor, his three As-
sistants Heads, and the new fresh-
ean class officers. This committee
would assume the duties and respon-
sibilities heretofore exercised by the
Dean of Students, therefore acting to
more effectively bring the freshman
class under aegis o {student govern-
ment. In the same area, I propose
that all freshmen, at some time dur-
ing the coming year, be invited to

(Continued on page 4)

 

Framptom,

Joe Frampton
Candidate for Secretary

The office which I seek requires «
dual role. In addition to performing
duties peculiar to his office, the
Secretary of the Student Body will
sit also as a regular member of the
Executive Committee. In this light
I feel it necessary to state several
personal views. First, | support the
Honor System as the most valuable
asset of Washington and Lee. The
Executive Committee must maintain
the System through responsibile
judgment and a full awareness . of
personal freedom. Second, | intend to
support conventional dress as a time-
honored tradition which helps make
Washington and Lee unique. Third,
1 regret the depletion of the speak-
ing tradition and believe that the
Executive Committee should seek
methods to revive it

The duties I entend to perform as
Secretary of the Student Bedy are
several. First, as a Student Bedy
officer. I will assist and acrve the
President in order to facilitate the
operation of the Executive Committe
Second, I feel a need to be punctual
and therough in the general clerical
duties which I must perform. Third,
I believe there exists a definite
need to keep the Student Hedy wel!
informed about the operation of the
Executive Committee. Therefore. |
intend to continue the practice of
posting minutes and notices in pub-
lic places as a toward better
communications between the
Executive Committee and the Stu-
dent Hedy

I wish my ability

the Executive Committee to he

Bob Lee
Candidate for Vice President

There are several reasons why I
have decided to run for the Vice
Presidency of the Student Body.
Principal among these is my firm
conviction that no candidate, re-
gardless of his ostensible qualifica-
tions, should run unopposed for so
high an office.

Secondly, and let me assure you,
I would not have decided to run
for the office of Vice President un-
less I were firmly convineed that
I could properly dischages the re-
sponsibilities of the office. I feel my-
self suitably qualified; if I didn’t, I
would not have made the decision
to announce my candidacy.

Also, I believe that as the cam-
paign develops there will emerge is-
sues on which my opponent and I
fundamentally disagree.

Frankly, what are these so-called
issues. The first, and most important,
is our Honor System. It has become
demonstrably clear that our Honor
System is the single most distinctive
aspect of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity. Our Honor System is an ef-
fective one, but we must never lose
sight of the faet that it could per-
haps be made more effective and that
it must always remain consonant
with prevaling concepts of “justice.”
Is our Honor System distinctive be-
cause it has retained over the years
the “absolute penalty,” or is it dis-
tinctive because it works, and is
the fact that it does work inextrica-
bly tied with the absolute penalty. I
believe the Honor System works
because the students at W&L believe
in it and want to see it work. I do
not believe that it has worked over
the years because the students are
“eowered” into honesty by the fear
of the absolute penalty. Recently, it
has it has been shown that breaches
of law and of honesty are related not
to the magnitude or servity of
punishment for such breaches, but
to the chances of being caught. I
believe that students who observe
honor violations are presently hesi-
tant to report such offenses because
they fear that in reporting them they
will be destroying some student's life.
Regardless of the validity of such
a feeling, it is probable that a modi-
fication of the penalty wil lereate a
more healthy atmosphere on campus
and will induce those who have mor-

pension will serve equally as well
as the absolute penalty in discour-

get that a system of justice, and in-
deed our Honor System is such, must
not ignore that all men are capable
of committing breaches of honer un-

that mercy in such instances is
justice. We should seek to rehabili-

backs on him.

Dave Marchese
Candidate for Vice President

In any _ political election, the
qualifications of the candidates could
stir much interest among the voting
body; in the allotted space I hope
to reveal this factor as it reflects
on my candidacy.

What exactly should qualifications
mean to us at Washington and Lee?
The campaign posters which “deco-
rate” our campus this week attempt
to present a brief resume of the can-
didates major significant contribu-
tions and accomplishments.

I feel my qualifications sive an in-
dication of my involvement in stu-
dent body life. If I didn’t believe
I were qualified for the position or
could effectively represent the stu-
dent body I would not have sought
the office for Vice-President. The
experience gained from such invol-
vement in student body life has been
immensely beneficial. It has provided
me with a knowledge of the work-
ings of the Student government as
well as the opportunity to commun-
icate and work with many students.

In addition to qualifications, the
views and ideas advocated by each
candidate should be of prime concern
to the electorate.

Honor System

The primary issue in this race con-
cerns the Honor System. I would like
to make it clear from the start my
position in this regard: I wholeheart-
edly oppose the changes which have
been proposed this year. Whereas
my opponent advocates a one year
penalty as sufficient punishment for
a breach of our honor code. I fell
that such an arrangement would not
only be disagreeable to the majority
of the student body, who come to
Washington and Lee admiring such a
system and realizing that the inevi-
table consequence of such a breach
of honor would permanently disas-
sociate with. Washington and Lee;
but also the change would be detere-
mental to the attitudes of individ-
ual students whose concept of hon-
or and integrity would be relegated
to an apathetic disillusionment with
the system. By accepting and under-
standing the system as it now stands
we learn from the past the ideals
and concepts upon which the system
was intended to exist. Hopefully,
this experience will guide us in fu-
ture endeavors.

While we have seen this system
violated and threatened seriously
in the past (early 1950's seandal)
we have also seen how it has with-
stood such attacks only to live as
strong as under its original
guise. To change Washington and
Lee whenever one sees fit does not,
] feel, necessitate a change in the
most nationally, locally and person-
ally revered traditions of our in-
stitution. It appears to me that after
Mr. Lee's change, Washington and
Lee would not be the Washington
and Lee we admire and know has

for such aetion,” nor his attitude
that the E.C. gave the students their
chance and this they forfeited, are
anywhere near my belief in “active
representation” or my view of the
positive lead the President of the
Student Body must take.

One eriticism that I have heard
voiced to some of my ideas is the
fact that “active representation”
would be often difficult to achieve,
especially in the light of the poor
turnout for the two referendums
this year. My opponent told me vir-
tually the same thing when told of
my plan to poll members of our
class. My response to this criticism

concisely sums up my basic at-
titude toward the E.C. student

leadership and our school in gen-
eral: If I was able, working merely
with a friend in each fraternity house
plus several independent students,
to successfully poll over 65 per cent
of my class in only three days, there

is absolutely no reason why the E.C.,|'

especially in conjunction with such
bodies as the Assimilation Committee
or the LF.C. and Independent Union,
could not receive a much wider stu-
dent consensus provided proper
handling was insured. If leaders are
positive enough, want to accomplish
something badly enough, and are

willing to devote the necessary time!

and energy toward this goal, the job
not only can be, but will be done.
The Problem

At the present moment our cam-|
crisis in|
leadership. We are without a positive |

pus is suffering from a
channel by which to effectively seek
out, express and/or enact student
consensus. Despite the now almost
trite statements that the student
body in general is apathetic, there
definitely exists energy as well as
attempts at leadership, but these are
without a cohesive, directive, and
“representative” lead. There are cer-

tain areas where our trustees and
administration refuse to take the
initiative; therefore it is up toe the

students to act through their elected
representative body, the EC., to
alleviate areas of dissatisfaction and
that the needed improvements
are not neglected. But the E.C. can
only successfully take this positive
and initiative leadership if such a
tone is set by the President, which
was not the ease this year. Though
attempts at initiative and represen-
tative leadership were certainly made
by certain members of this year’s
committee, these were hampered by
the tone that

The E.C.’s recent interpretation of

urged along with others, would have
gone back to the students for more

contingent from the University of
New Hampshire, 9-8, in a closely
contested game, which the Generals
might have won had it not been for

nate the following afternoon, as
they won their first game of the

Editorial Comment On Candidates

(Continued from page 2)
ing for in this campaign—and if his record is any indication—
there is every belief that he will carry out his platform if he is
elected. Mindel’s platform would be enacted with great benefit;
but it is not as important, we think, as is the new attitude he
represents.

One last piece of evidence in favor of Mindel is perhaps
crucial: that he has been endorsed by four of the most influ-
entional members of the E.C. Three of those publishing a
letter for Mindel are members of the University Party which
he opposes; but as in past years, party ties cannot restrict the
strong feeling which most E.C. members have regarding the
election of a new president of the Student body. The fourth
E.C. member to support Mindel is a law student. Mindel had
no “political” allies on the E.C., i.e., every undergraduate
member of the Committee is a member of Walker’s political
party. By his idealism and his striking leadership attracted such
voluntary endorsement none the less.

Vice President

For vice presidency, Dave Marchese and Bob Lee present
another very tight contest. Marchese, a Phi Gam, is a member
of ODK, a Dean’s List student, president of the junior class,
and president of this year’s Springs weekend. He is president
and past rush chairman of his fraternity, is an officer in
SWMSEC and a member of SSS. He has been outstanding
in debating activities. The extent of Marchese’s activities indi-
cates a real interest in student body affairs; a real ability to
get things accomplished; and a personal initiative in leadership.

Bob Lee, a Phi Psi, is vice president of the junior class, an
officer of SSS and a member of SWMSFC. He is president of
his fraternity, is a member of the Assimilation Committee, and
is a section editor of the Calyx. Lee is also a member of the
commerce fraternity, the Liberty Hall Society, and the “13”
Club. These activities and a strong personality have made Lee
a good possibility to upset Marchese and the Party. However,
Lee’s qualifications just can’t measure up to those of Marchese
in extent and evidence of initiative. In addition to this, Lee’s
grades are very low for a candidate for student body office.
Lee has issued a statement affirming his support for chang-
ing the Honor System to institute a penalty of suspension;
this stand is consistent with past statements made by him. We
feel that this proposal, if ever enacted, would be disastrous for
the Honor System, and that to elect a man running on such
a stand would be to put support where it would be ill used.

A vote for Lee is a vote for this platform; while a vote for
Marchese is a vote for responsibility and initiative in student
government; therefore the Ring-tum Phi urges Marchese’s|

 

 

election.

Just as the newspaper choice of candidates has straddled
Party lines, we also urge every student to cast his vote irrespec- |
tive of Party lines; only in this way will a responsible student,

government be maintained.

tions. I do not think that political
parties are needed at W&L, indeed
I think they are a detriment. I feel
their abolition could be accomplish-
ed by first primaries—to bring poli-
ties into the open, and second, my
election—to show to the cliques that
the W&L Student Body is opposed to
this system.

I wholeheartedly support Conven-
tional Dress as a worthwhile tradi-
tion of our campus, but I am not in
favor of an Assimilation Committee
which is based on a_ spoils system
for the fraternities and which makes
Conventional Dress a rule rather thn
a tradition. I am in complete dis-
agreement with the interpretation of
the recent Conventional Dress refer-
endum in which a majority of the
students who voted showed some
dissatisfaction with the present sys-
tem. I believe that I have sufficiently
shown my interest in the subject by
being one of the original signers of
the petition requesting that referen-
dum. If elected, I will work to make
Conventional Dress a real tradition
at W&L based on the support of a
majority of the students.

The only way these goals can be
achieved is for each individual mem-
ber of the E.C. to recognize his re-
sponsibility to the Student Body.
This I will try to do.

In my three years as a student at

strongly support and wish to main-

of our student body, while support-

implement, or rather, enforce it. I

I feel that the present system of

seem to arise, but soon succumb to
“protest limbo.” I am hoping that
the ODK Leadership Forum, com-
posed of the fraternity house pres-
idents, and representatives from the
Independent Union, and the various
clubs and organizations on campus
will act as a sounding board for
any questions, problems, or contro-
versies that arise on compus. This
forum, as a committee of effective
total representation, would investi-
gate, study and submit recommenda-
tions to the Executive Committee for
further action.

I am a nominee of the University

I am seeking your support as an

I believe in a party system of pol-

tions, clubs, or whatever one chooses
to eall them. However, I do feel the

sideration which must undergo our
scrutiny. The recent school wide re-
ferendum on conventional dress, in
which some 60 per cent of the stu-
dent body registered some sort of
disapproval, was subject to the worst
sort of political chicanery. The E.C.
at first refused even to set up a sub-
committee to analyze the results, and
the student body was led to believe
that the apathy in voting was a
mandate for the status quo. Conven-
tional dress ought to be maintained
at Washington and Lee, but let us
concern ourselves not with the let-

 

eames

 

 

ter of conventional dress but with
the spirit. Our concern ought to be
that of keeping the campus neat
and not of enforcing convetnional
dress in the town of Lexington when
it is often inconvenient to the indi-
vidual student. If petty violations
were to go unreported, would it not
in fact strengthen student support
of conventional dress? And would it
not permit a little more individual
freedom for those who find it diffi-
cult to adhere to the letter of the
dress code? What I seek is to
strengthen conventional dress, not to
see continued discredit brought to
bear upon it. We might even in the
near future establish a test period in
which the activities of the Assimila-
tion Committee would be suspended
to see if we can maintain conven-
tional dress without punitive sup-
ervision. If ‘this failed, I would
strongly recommend reverting back
to the present situation.

It has become more and more ob-
vious here at W&L that there is a
serious leadership vacuum. Even the
administration, which has within its
powers the authority to initiate
change, has failed pitifully to rec-
ommend changes where they are
needed. The only other agency on,
campus which can assume the ini-
tiative is the E.C. and up until now
it has demonstrated that it lacks the
will to do so. I think the time has
come when we can no longer toler-
ate this. We must not elect another
E.C. which ignores or fails to articu-
late student demands. The use of
referendums and petitions to the ad-
ministration are only two possible
ways in which the E.C. can articulate
and dramatize student dissatisfaction
and protest. Why it has failed to do
this is beyond my comprehension.

attend a meeting of the Executive
Committee. This will be a further
deterrent to student apathy in re-
gard to campus government, and it
will help modify the impression of
mysterious elitism which often sur-

 

rounds the Executive Committee.

I wholeheartedly believe in and
support the Honor System, and I feel
that at such time as a student vio-
lates the trust placed in him by this
University he has servered his con-
nection with it. I do not wish to see
the Honor System eliminated from
discussion, however; this I encour-
age.

It has been suggested that the
principle of consesus should be the
underlying determinant of student
government. I agree that in most
areas this would apply. However, I
strongly discourage the advocation
of consensus as panacea for all
actions. The expression of student
opinion is often ambiguous, as in
the case of the recent Assimilation
Committee referendum, and I would
suggest that in some significant areas
a reliance on consesus would only
lead to indecisive student govern-
ment,

Finally, to assert a leadership gap
in our student government is all
too easy an approach. I think that
such leadership is inadequate if it
does not question, if it does not ex-
amine, if it does not realize the need
for constructive improvement in both
general and specific sense—in short,
if it is complacent. If I am elected
President of the Student Body, I
promise that complacency will be as
nonexistent as I can make it.
