University shuts down

For the first time in over a
decade, the university shut down
its operations because of weather-
related problems Monday.

The last time such a closing oc-
curred was in the 1960s when
classes were cancelled due to
heavy snow.

The problems this time were
caused by cold winds from Canada
coming through the Midwest and
taking up residence in Virginia.

Sunday night the James River
was frozen and Virginia Electric

     

mg

and Power Company (Vepco) had
ice blocking the intakes for its
cooling and condensing systems
at the Chesterfield and Surry gen-
erating plants, according to a
spokesman for the utility.

Vepco began shutting off power
to different areas of the com-
monwealth Monday morning to
compensate for the loss of egiht
generators in the Eastern Virginia
power plants as well as the fa-
cility at Mount Storn in West
Virginia.

The university got word Mon-
day morning that its turn to lose
power would come from 12:30 to
2:30 in the afternoon.

Vepco had solved enough of its
problems to continue service by
that time but most activities at
W&L had already been cancelled.

Work in some offices continued,
but the lights were turned off to
conserve energy.

Electric typewriters were still
in use.

Evans Dining Hall served lunch
using paper utensils and dishes
after turning off their diswashers
in anticipation of the power loss.

Someone was standing in the
quad of the old dorms around
noon instructing freshmen to turn
oil their lights and any non-es-
sential electric devices.

Loud rock music could still be
heard coming from _ students’
stereos.

\ll but one row of lights in the

Co-op were turned off early in
the morning.
The pinball machines in the

Cockpit remained on.

Freshman convicted

for snowball assault
By RICK MAKOU

\ Washington and Lee student
now has a criminal record as the
result of throwing a snowball.

On Jan. 4th, freshman Reid M.
Slaughter was standing on the
corner of Washington Street and
Lee Avenue near the Sigma Chi
house. Slaughter noticed that sev-
eral people were throwing snow-
balls and decided to join in the
fun.

He threw a snowball at a friend,
Cove Geary, who was standing on
the other side of Washington
Street; however, part of the snow-
ball went astray and hit a pass-
ing car.

Lexington Patrolman John K.
Colbert saw the act, stopped
Slaughter, and issued a summons
for’ ‘discharging a guided missile
al a moving vehicle.” Slaughter
protested that the snowball was
not purposely thrown at the car
and that the driver was unaware
that his car had been hit, but
Colbert was unsympathetic.

Disgusted, Slaughter told Col-
bert that this was “small-twon
justice” and that things like this
gave small-town policemen a bad
Leputation

Slaughter appeared in court on

Jan. 11. When he told General
District Court Judge Joseph E.
liess what the charge was, the

jidge chuckled. The judge looked
ip the law and found that throw-
ing a missile into the street was
a misdemeanor

Sl.ughter retold the story and
argucd that being from Texas, he
rarely saw snow and was just
excited. But the judge found
him guilty.

The judge suspended the fine
and stated that the conviction will
stand to “uphold the dignity of
the law” and serve as a warning
for future snowball throwers.

Power

Perhaps there are those who welcome a temporary shut
down of University operations as a way to get out of going
to school and studying. In elementary and high school, such
events were cause for riotous celebration. Rarely if ever did
we stop to consider the reasons behind or the consequences

beyond a school closing.

| spoke with a secretary in Washington Hall who could
remember only one other oceasion on which the University
had been forced to shut down. That was during the Sixties,
due to an excessively heavy snowfall which prevented many
faculty and students from reaching the campus. This time,
Winter was again the ostensible villain, freezing over the
James River and forcing Vepeo to shut off a number of gen
erators and henee causing a dramatic reduction in the amount

of available power.

\ecording to James Arthur, superintendent of building
and grounds, Vepeo informed the University around 7:00 a.m
that power consumption would have to be reduced on Calipus
Hence the semi-darkened Co-op which greeted A-hour dic
Between 10 and 10:30 a.m., Vepeo told the University
that all power would be cut off from 12:30 to 2:30 p.m., and
\rthur consulted with the University Treasurer James Whit
President Robert FE. R. Huntley, who made the

Music program at University

shackled by space prob!

By STEPHEN YEVICH

The following article is the
second of a series investigating
the state of the fine arts pro-
grams at W&L.

Twenty-four years ago Wash-
ington and Lee University hired
its first professor whose time was
devoted exclusively to teaching
music appreciation courses. His
first semester he taught a total
of fifteen students.

That professor was Robert
Stewart, current head of the
music division of the Fine Arts

Department. This past fall threre
were nearly 200 students enrolled
in music courses. Music instruc-
tion on this campus has made
significant progress, but there is
still plenty of room for improve-
ment.

When he arrived in Lexington

in September 1955 Professor
Stewart joined three Fine Art
instructors. Prior to that time
Professor Stephenson (German

Dept.) taught one course in music
appreciation. There was a glee
club and an ROTC band of 60
members (the ROTC corps was
800 men strong in those days).

Within several years Stewart
had added composition and theory
courses, and had helped organize
a brass choir as well as small
instrumental ensembles. Classes
in the history of Classical and
Romantic music were worked into
the curriculum.

James Cook was added to the
faculty in the autumn of 1968,
when he was hired as a temporary
replacement for Stewart, who was
on sabbatical. Cook made such a
hit with the students that he was
permanently hired (besides, the
work load was heavy enough to
warrant two full time professors)
More courses were added, in
struction in violin, and piano was
begun.

Gordon Spice came to Lexing
ton four years ago, as W&L’s first
full-time voice teacher. His duties
now also include directing the
glee club and conducting several
music history courses.

What does W&L offer its stu
dents in 1977 in the way of
music, both through instruction

and in extracurricular activities?
Besides the courses (six in his-
tory and appreciation, twelve
offerings in applied music, ten
in theory) taught by a small but
quite competent staff of three,
there is the Glee Club, the Sa-
eracs and Southern Comfort for
students who are vocally inclined;
the Jazz Ensemble, the Brass and
Percussion Ensemble, and small
ensembles for various combina
ions of instruments. Students
also can participate in Lexing
ton’s community orchestra and
horus. The prime force fo
scheduling concerts on campus is
the Concert Guild, composed of
students interested in bringing
juality performers to campus, a

taught appreciation courses. An
Independent Major with Emphasis
in Musie (either musicology or
composition) is possible, although
a departmental major in the
normal sense of the word is not
available.

The major problem confonting
the Music Division and students
taking courses therein is that of
space. Current space available for
music practice rooms and class-
rooms is divided between the
basement of the Student Center
and McCormick Library, not the
best of locations for a music class.
There just is not room at present
to accommodate the various
classes and activities in the limit-
ed facilities available. There is
only one classroom for apprecia-
tion courses and for audio fa-
cilities—students studying tapes
or records must vacate the room
during class sessions.

The problem is acute for those
involved in composition and
applied music. There are just four
practice rooms and one small
classroom. Vying for practice time
are 12 piano students, 12 composi-
tion students, 6 voice students,
several violin students, a glee club
pianist, a glee club, two singing
groups, and four or more en-
sembles. When the larger groups
practice none of the rooms are
available for use, because of the

close proximity and lack of
acoustical insulation between
them.

Access to the rooms in the Stu-
dent Center is allowed from 8 a.m.
to 1 am., though effective time
use is limited to 3 p.m.-1 a.m.
because of individual lessons and
classes offered during the morn.-
ings and early afternoons. Music
students are required to practice
five hours per week. The glee
club meets four days a week.
Other groups often practice to
gether. Needless to say, finding
a room in which to practice can
be a difficult task on this campus,
and is well nigh impossible dur-
ing most normal hours of the day

Because of space and schedul-
ing limitations thirty-five students
were refused admission into In
troductory Musie Appreciation
(course 151, “Drop the Needle”).
this past fall. There are twenty-
six students on a waiting list to
take instruction in piano from
Prof. Cook. Obviously everyone
who wants music is not getting it

The solution to the problem
is to increase the staff, but that
cannot be done until more space
is made available. Plans to aug-
ment the department have been
formulated, but no one is doing
anything until the Front Campus

W&L does not offer a major

At present the W&L campus
lacks adequate facilities for
musical performances. Sure, Lee

like the Stradivari String Quartet,

worthless—for example, a voice
major would have had practice
in only one large group, the Glee
Club, and no experience in a mix-
ed chorus or opera.

Most importantly, a music ma-
jor would destroy the depart-
ment’'s philosophy of “music for
all students,” since teachers would
have little time for the casual
students seeking courses. in
broaden his background in music.
Dean Watt has estimated that
75% of W&L’s students take at
least one music course between
orientation and graduation, The
independent program now offered

estras, and opera groups, and
except for an occasional “1776”
W&L cannot attempt any musical
extravaganzas of its own.

The need for an auditorium is
ever present. A multi-purpose fa-
cility seating about 1000 would
be just fine, its primary function

being to house theatrical pro-
ductions emanating from the

Drama division. As Gordon Spice
said about current facilities, “You
can’t do grand opera in an ink-
well.” Think about it—Wagner in
the Old Boiler Room?

Matmen win 2 of last 3

Joy and jubilation it was not.
But the Washington and Lee
wrestling squad was more than
satisfied after capturing two vic-
tories in three matches last week.
The Generals routed ODAC foe
Eastern Mennonite 30-15 last
Wednesday and split a triangular
match with Duke University and
George Mason on Saturday.

The victory over George Mason,
an exciting 19-18 decision, was
particularly satisfying to the W&L
matmen but it was the Eastern
Mennonite match that counted for
the most as it was a conference
team. However, the coach and
team members did not appear to
be overly satisfied about the final
results of that match.

Freshman Todd Wohler, a 15-
10 winner in the 158 pound class,
commented on the Mennonite
contest saying, “We expected
them to be pretty easy and as
a result I don’t think we wrestled
as well as we could have. I know
I didn’t.” Team captain Jim
Crytzer readily agreed with
Wohler. “Everyone took them a

little too lightly.”
Some excuse is available for

the wrestling squad, however, as
even Coach Gary Franke saw no
challenge from Mennonite. In
faet, he did not wrestle many of
his first unit members so that
the younger members could get a
chance. Franke pointed out that
“We used most of our younger
people to give them some experi-
ence. We saw some good things
out of them.” The Generals lost
only three out of the ten weight
classes but they only managed to

Basketball

A suceessful week, indeed.
Entering the week, the basketball
Generals were 8-2 overall, and 2-1
and in second place in the Old
Dominoin Athletic Conference
race. The team is now sporting
an overall record of 10-2, with a
league mark of 4-1. and holding
a share of first place.

The two league victories were
key ‘wins, 75-70 over Lynchburg,
and 98-78 over Eastern Mennonite.
The come from behind win over
the Hornets in Lynchburg was
important not only for the team’s
won-loss record, but should the
Generals and Lynchburg tie for
the conference title in regular
season play, W&L would be de-
clared champion on the strength
of the teams two victories over
Lynchburg. Earlier this season,
W&L defeated the Hornets 91-87

Coach Verne Canfield had this
to say about the win over the
Generals’ arch-rival, “The players
never gave up in the face of ad-
versity. Despite trailing by such
a large margin early in the game,
the team never doubted that they
would come back and bring home
the victory.” The Generals trailed
by as many as nineteen early in
the first half at 27-8 and 29-10,

but managed to cut the Hornets * which

halftime lead to six at 37-31.

record one pin, that by Ray
Gross in the 150 pound division.
The lopsided win left the Gen-
erals with a 2-0 mark in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference.

Saturday, W&L faced possibly
two of the toughest opponents on
their schedule this year. This time
the homestanding Generals were
not about to take anybody lightly.
But then, neither was Duke as
they proved by hammering the
Generals 30-10. The sting of their
second defeat of the season was
erased, however, by a clutch win
over George Mason,

Coach Franke commented on
the triangular meet saying, ‘‘Duke
has traditionally been tough for
us. They were just a little too
tough for us to handle. But Dan
Kniffen came through with a
victory to put us over George
Mason.” Ed ‘Stork’ Rogers was
even more lavish in the praise
of his teammates. “I thought the
team really wrestled well. We
wrestled real smart. It was just
a real good team victory.”

Everyone agreed that it was
the performance of Kniffen in the
heavyweight class that keyed the
victory over GM. The Generals
were sluggish in the early going
and found themselves behind 12-0
against Mason before they could
score a victory. W&L wrestled
valiantly from behind until the
score was 18-16 with Kniffen fac-
ing Stanley in the final event.
Kniffen came up with a big sec-
ond round for a 9-3 decision and
the team victory. But the Gen-
erals never had a chance against

a strong Duke contingent as only
Gross, Crytzer and Bill Cole were
able to record victories in their
individual divisions. The Generals
are now 5-2 on the season.

Gross and Crytzer were the best
wrestlers of the week as neither
one was defeated. Gross recorded
two decisions (12-4, 5-1) and a pin.
Cryter remained undefeated for
the season with two decisions 13-5
and 10-3.

The next match for W&L will
be Saturday at Charleston, South
Carolina in the Citadel Tourna-
ment. At least one member of the
squad feels that this will be a
big match for the Generals.
Crytzer declared, “The Citadel
Tournament always has good com-
petition. I think it will be a
good tournament for us.” The
grapplers captain further predict-
ed that the ODAC championship
will very likely be won by W&L—
a sentiment expressed by many
of the wrestlers. As Crytzer
noted, “I don’t see any reason
why we can’t take eight indi-
vidual championships out of the
ten weight classes.”

Although the ODAC team
championship certainly seems al-
tainable, it will be a tall order
for W&L to capture eight indi-
vidual titles. It will be even
tougher if Howdy Knipp, twice
a letterman and ex-VCAA champ-
ion, does not recover from a re-
cent injury. His loss has weakened
the W&L club in the lower weight
classes. Regardless, the Generals
appear to be headed for a very
successful season.

En garde! ‘Thrust!

By J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER

Attention: It is that time of
year again for all new extra-
curricular and athletic clubs to
arise and approach the E.C. for
funds to get off the ground. This
year’s anticipated crowd is being
led by the W&L Fencing Club,
founded by resident psychologist,
Dr. James Worth.

Last week the E.C. appropri-
ated $100 to the Fencing Club
after Dr. Worth convinced them
that there was substantial student

team defeats Lynchburg, EMC

With 6:50 remaining in the con-
test, W&L took the lead for the
first time all evening on a break-
away basket by senior Chris Lar-
son. They were never to trail
again. An important factor in the
win was that the Generals’ bench
came through with 16 points for
the evening compared to Lynch-
burg’s two, Despite the early defi-
cit, the Generals consistently
and confidently chipped away at
the lead until they managed to
take it, and held it with, as Can-
field said, “Some heady, smart
basketball.”

Lynchburg’s last chance for re-
venge this season will have to
come in the ODAC tournament,
scheduled for February 25th and
26th at W&L. The top four con-
ference teams determined by
regular season won-loss record
qualify for the tourney, with the

tournament champion receiving
the automatic berth to the

NCAA's South Atlantic Regional.

The Hornets defeated Hamp-
den-Sydney 76-74 last Saturday
to put the Tigers and W&L into
1 virtual tie for first place. The
Generals are actually leading with
a winning percentage of .800
compared to HS’ 666. W&L,

anxiously awaiting the second
meeting between the two teams,
scheduled for January 25th in
Farmville. If the Generals can
claim that victory, they could virt-
ually clinch the regular season
conference title, and secure them-
selves of being the top seed in
the February. tournament.

Pat Dennis had a week players
dream of, scoring 17 against
Lynehburg on 8-12 from the field,
and hitting for 30 points against
EMC on 15 of 23 from the field.
For the two games, the junior
guard averaged 23.5 ppg and had
a .65 shooting percentage. He also
had nine rebounds against the
Royals.

Chris Larson continued his out-
standing play off the bench, hit-
ting for 12 second half points
in Lynchburg, and adding 22 in
the win over EMC. Co-captain Bob
Flint, the Generals’ most con-
sistent player, had 16 points and
10 :ebounds against the Hornets,
and scored 19 points and grabbed
12 carons last Friday. Dave Leunig
and Don Berlin also hit double
figures in the 75-70 victory over
Lynchburg, with 12 and 10 points,
respectively.

Point guard Mike Wenke, a 5-10
sophomore, tossed 11 assists
EMC to set a new school record
for one game. Wenke has now
thrown 76 assists in the teams’
12 games, and with 14 games re
maining, appears a sure bet to
shatter the seasonal record of 122

interest to warrant such a grant.

Monday, in a return plea for
funds, the Club was granted

another $80 and the E.C. agreed
to loan them $100 more due to
the enthusiasth which the fencers
showed in starting their club.

Thirty-five potential fencers at-
tended the organizational meeting
two weeks ago and 12-15 members
have already ordered equipment,
which they will pay for them-
selves. Although only about 23
students attended the first two
practice sessions last week, Worth
is “delighted with the club so
far. | think the response shown
to the idea of a fencing club here
at W&L has been excellent.”

Worth has hopes of fielding an
intercollegiate fencing team. “If
by the end of this year we have
at least 6 students interested
enough to continue in the sport
and if we pick up two or three
freshmen next fall, then we can
definitely field a team. If by the
fall we have 12 fencers, then we'll
be in good shape.”

In fencing, three weapons are
ised: the foil, with which only
the point you can seore on the
upper body; the sabre, with which
the whole blade is a weapon on
the entire body: and the epee, in
which the entire body is target
to only the point.

three men per weapon, with three
alternates, and each fencer gets
a chance to fence every opposing
fencer, in his specialty. The team
that wins a pluralty of the
matches wins the meet.

Dr. Worth, reigning Virginia
state champion, became interested
in fencing back in high school
in Dayton, Ohio. “I joined the
Dayton Fencing Club while I was
a junior in high school and we
practiced at the local YMCA. I
gave it up because of studies, but
later joined the Ohio State team,
fencing varsity for three years
and lettering two years.” Worth
lost interest in the sport over the
next ten years, but then came to

Lexington where he met Tad
Humphries, VMI fencing coach
and captain of the 1942 W&L

Fencing Team. (W&L hasn’t had
a team since WWII). Needless to
say, Worth regained his interest.

“We hope the interest in-W&L
fencing will grow. It is a sport
in which someone with no previ-

ous athletic experience can
participate and participate sue-
cessfully. In fact, 95% of the

people who take up fencing, do so
after they have begun college. So
there is no reason for people who
think they will start behind the
others in talent to stay away.

Sen. Biden speaks on the new administration

(Continued from Page 1)
Committees and is a member of
the Select Committee on Intellig-
ence.

Considered one of the most out-
spoken men in Congress, Carter’s
National Campaign Manager
spoke with a self-admitted bias.

According to Biden, energy
problems “permeate and overlap”
all other problems facing Carter.
He said he expects to see Carter
send Congress a bill concerning
major reorganization of the
energy agencies within the next
three months. He said the bill will
be based on the premise that we
must eventually become energy
independent.

“A failure to do so may mean
we can make no _ independent
foreign policy decisions in the
future,” he said.

“President-elect Carter will
come out within the next six
months with an energy conserva-
tion program in which he will ask
the American people to make con-
siderable sacrifices,” Biden said.
“I think the American people will
rally behind this common prob-
lem.”

“The second part of the pro-
gram will make serious efforts
in the direction of alternative

trial.”

Pentifallo said he is bothered
by claims that any student was
tried unfairly. “They're question-
ing my integrity,” he said.

E.C. members refused to com-
ment further on the trial, since
the ease is still open and the
White Book forbids their releas-
ing information about any pri-
vate trial.

Administration officials were
still in conference with the E.C.
and the defense advisers at 1:30
\Vednesday afternoon.

Brooks said this incident is just
one example of the kind of prob-
loms black students have faced at
&L since the university inte
grated in 1970.

Wednesday afternoon members
of SABU were bringing groceries
into the area where they were
waiting. Many of them had
brought books to read. “We are
prepared to stay here and make
hings difficult in the operation
of this building,” Brooks said.

sources,” he said.

He said curing the economic ills
of Western Europe is a necessity
and also said that Carter re-
cognizes that economic policy has
a greater effect on foreign policy
than any other single factor.

Biden was very critical of the
way the U.S. gocernment is handl-
ing nuclear power in regard to
foreign countries.

“We are exporting nuclear cap:
ability not only to world powers,
but also to banana dictators,” he
said. “That’s stupid.”

Biden said China should be high
on the list of foreign aid priori-
ties and said he thought the
climate in the Middle East is cur-
rently good for a peace settle-
ment.

Biden said he expects Carter
to look for “a balance, if there
is one, between inflation and un-
employment” in the domestic eco-
nomy.

While answering questions,
Biden also said that he felt Carter
had no choice but to adopt a more
enlightened policy towards South
Africa.

“It is hypocritical for a white
politician to say he supports black
America and apartheid at the
same time,” he said.

In commenting on his own
reputation as an environmentalist,
Biden indicated how Sen. Scott of
Virginia felt about the subject.
According to Biden, Scott once
came up to him and said, “The
trouble with you and all the other
environment freaks is that you
think gasoline causes cancer.”

Coach Bill Stearn’s tankers are
preparing for Friday's tri-meet
with cross-town rival VMI and
Towson State scheduled for
W&L’s Doremus Pool beginning
at 4:00 p.m. A sweep in Friday’s

mark of 5-1 on the season, with
four dual meets remaining. The
meet is the last home swim meet

This is not the first time dis-
satisfaction with student govern-
ment actions has prompted
SABU to stage a protest.

In October, 1975, the organiza-
tion held a rally and march
around the dormitories. Accord-
ing to SABU spokesmen at the
time, the rally was to express
their anger about the lack of
black entertainment on campus
and at the lack of concern shown
black problems by the E.C. and
Student Activities Board.

Later in the year SABU refused
‘o continue aiding the Recruit-
ment Committee in bringing black
students to W&L.

Brooks said at that time that
SABU could not continue to ask
biack students to come to a
s-hool where the organization felt
they were not welcome.

This year’s freshman class of
406 contained only two black stu-
dents.

The protests last year brought
about the formation of the Mi-
nority Affairs Co-ordinating Com-

honor system, specifically the
absolute penalty of expulsion for
all offenses. But he held that the
honor code itself was sound.

The panel arguea that the
volunteer army was not costing
the taxpayers more than a drafted
army, and as volunteers began to
serve longer costs would actually
decrease as training costs
dropped .Many of the increases in
military costs were due to in-
creases in the pay scales ordered
by the Congress before the
changeover to an all-volunteer
force, ’

The panel also emphasized that
today’s army was of a higher
quality than the drafted force,
due to the higher education levels
of recruits.

_Unionization of the Army was
dismissed by Col. Boone as “pos-
sible, but not probable.” Boone

said the Army would probably not
be unionized because it already
is a union of sorts. He said junior
officers and non-commissioned
officers serve as shop stewards and
the Inspector General Corps
serves as a grievance committee.
Boone said the reason many
European armies unionized was
because they didn’t receive the
pay scale and benefits considered
standard in America.

A discussion of infantry tactics
and American policy in Asia and
Europe again brought out the de-
terrent role of the Army. The
panel argued that to be effective,
defense policy should not cut any
options which the army might
have in defending interests in
Japan, Korea and Europe.

The panel’s appearance at W&L
was sponsored by the W&L Mili-
tary Science department.
