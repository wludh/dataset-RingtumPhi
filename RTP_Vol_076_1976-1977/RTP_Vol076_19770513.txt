Noell announces resignation;
accepts job at UVa

After nearly seven years as
associate dean of Washington
and Lee, William A. Noell has
announced that he will be
leaving the school. Noell has
accepted a similar position with
the University of Virginia’s law
school in Charlottesville. In his
new job, Noell said he will be
working in the financial aid
department while doing some
admissions work. He also will
be conducting regular seminars
in legal writing for first year
law students.

Noell came to W&L from a
law practice in Washington D.
C. in 1970. He is a graduate from
the UVa law school and said his
“close relationship with the law
school’’ was his main reason for
leaving his W&L post.

“It wasn’t an easy decision to
make,’’ Noell said when asked
why he decided to make his
move. “I hope I’ve made the
right decision.”

Professor of English, H.
Robert Huntley has been chosen
to take the place of Noell.
Huntley, a graduate of the
University of Wisconsin, has
been with the school for 15
years, joining the staff in 1962.

Huntley said the full impact of
his selection has not yet hit him.
He said he has always been
interested in admissions work
and has done small amounts of
recruitment for the past seven
years.

He said he will not have
regular classes next year and
instead will conduct an English
seminar on Monday mornings
so that the rest of his week can
be dedicated to recruitment
purposes.

Huntley said two and possibly
three new English professors
will be added to next year’s
staff to take up the slack that
has been created by his and
fellowEnglish professor Ed

New orders, transfer
ROTC instructors

by Reid Slaughter

Having received new orders
by the Army, three of
Washington and Lee’s ROTC
instructors, Col. Louis P. Mc-
Fadden, Capt. John K. Miller
and Maj. Wolf Kutter, will be
leaving this year after a short
but productive stay.

The three men have been
teaching at W&L for three, four,
and three years respectively.
During this time, enrollment in
ROTC has tripled, and the
program itself has undergone a
complete facelift. ‘Over the
past three years, the depart-
ment as a whole has generated
genuine concern for the
student,” said Maj. Kutter,
“also, we have cut out un-
necessary regulations for fresh-
man and sophomores such as
short hair, marching and
drilling and substituted ac-
tivities like rappelling and sky-
diving.”

Overall, the three men have
stressed building leadership
qualities into the ROTC
students, while making it ‘fun to
learn’. In addition, the in-
structors themselves have been
more readily available to the
students and tried to keep the
department abrest of the
current status of the Army with
its myriad of operations.

One instance is in the
departments push for more
ROTC students to go into the
Reserves. ‘“The Army looks far
beyond the use of force as an

instrument of national policy,”’
stated Kutter, “‘if the force level
is great enough to deter an
attack, then you have avoided
war without fighting. The effort
now is to shore up the Reserve
components; the active Army
has an ample number of combat
officers.”

The destinations of the three
men are very different. Col.
McFadden, the chairman of the
department, is retiring after 20
years of military service. He

Lewis’ Dream Realized
alumni get swilled

by Robert Chiaviello

The skies cleared, the
weather turned warm, and
there was mystery in the air.
Older men with little name tags
on their lapels filled the Cock-
pit, a driver was dispatched to
Roanoke in search of 50 dozen
petit fours, Mercedes,
Cadillacs, and Rolls Royces
clogged the roadways. Signs
sprung up everywhere solemnly
directing the attention of all to
the ominous LEWIS HALL,
home of the W&L legal eagles.
Something big was about to
happen, and it did.

At 11:00 a.m. on Saturday
morning I scurried over to
Lewis Hall with a cute little
photographer in hand to cover

Numerous wide-eyed faculty
members and red-eyed alumni
were milling about waiting
anxiously for the fun to begin.
The question on everyone’s lips,
‘“‘when are they going to tap that
damn keg of Scotch.”

At 11:30 President Huntley
made a move toward the
podium, the multitude took
their places and waited
patiently. No sooner had Liz
Taylor and John Warner taken
their seats next to me when

President Huntley called the
ceremony to order.

All bowed their heads in
reverence as Dr. John Newton
Thomas delivered a solemn
invocation in a fine fire-and-
brimstone style. When all had
retaken their seats President
Huntley introduced E. Marshall

and land animals,

by Dr. Hickman of the Biology
Department.

 

Almost one hundred and fifty
years ago, Charles Darwin
ventured to the Galapogos
Islands to study the animal life
there and to develop his theory
of evolution. His studies in 1835
prompted the voyage of other
biologists to the 16 volcanic
islands and associated inlets 600
miles from the coast of Equator
to observe the amazingly tame
wildlife unspoiled by the in-

Sixteen biology students from
Washington and Lee joined the
pilgrimage and traveled to the
islands in the Pacific for a first-
hand look at the unique birds
whose
existence is as undisturbed now
as it was during Darwin’s time.
The 16 were divided into two
groups of eight, and led around
the islands for intensive in-
dependent research, directed

Bio students lost
for three days

On March 30th, the first group
arrived at the Darwin Research
Station to begin their one month
of study. The Research Station
was a Starting point, where the
students underwent two days of
briefings before they embarked
on the real part of their journey
— sojourns to the different
islands to observe the wildlife in
its natural habitat. The Darwin
finch, the friget bird, iguanas,
tortoises, and the rare wood-
pecker finch (which uses a
barbed stick to pry its insect
victims from their hiding places
in trees. were all targeted for
study, unique from other birds
and animals because they have
not yet learned to fear man.

Living aboard a yacht, the
group would awaken every
morning at 5:30, breakfast, then
take a boat into one of the
islands for research until 11
o’clock. A swim, lunch, and rest
period would occupy the hottest
part of the day. Research would

Frantic housing race starts

by Lee Howard

Watch out. It is the time for
the mad, last-minute dash to
phones and cars as Washington
& Lee students look for housing.

Of course many students have
their apartments, farm houses

Of course many students have
their

Of course many students have
their apartments, lette

Of course many students have
their apartments, farm houses
or fraternity houses set for next
year. But independent fresh-
men, particularly, must find
apartments or roommates
before the end of the school
year. That’s where Mr. William
Mohler, director of university
services comes in. He helps
coordinate housing for W&L
students.

He helps coordinate housing
in a number of ways. First, he is
solely responsible for assigning
rooms controlled by the
university to upperclassmen
and law school students. This
means he controls the Woods
Creek Apartments, Lee I & II
and the Baker and Davis dorms.
Also, he puts out a list of
available housing in the
Lexington area.

However, Mohler’s list of
housing is not very descriptive.
It breaks housing down into four
categories: furnished rooms,
furnished apartments, un-
furnished apartments and
houses for rent. In most cases it
merely states the landlord’s
name and phone number and
the property’s address. Also,
the list is not necessarily up to
date since the only way the
Office of University Services
knows whether an apartment
has been taken is if the landlord
calls and tells them to take the
apartment off the list.

The Office of University
Services also does not get itself
involved in rental negotiations
or any other legal battle. An
exception to this was when a
black W&L student was denied
housing because of his race.
University Services lawyers
intervened in that case and
straightened it out, said Mr.
Mohler. But normally, as the
housing list says, ‘Matters
concerning rents, deposits,
rules, maintainance, utilities
and so forth must necessarily be
resolved privately between the
tenant and landlord.”

The housing list also makes it
clear that ‘“‘The Office of
University Services acts solely
as a clearing-house for in-
formation on accommodations.
The University cannot inspect
such facilities for adequacy,
and neither can it offer en-
‘dorsements or assume other
responsibility over them.” It
does not say on the list why the
Office of University Services
cannot inspect the facilities,
although Mohler makes it clear
that it is more a lack of time
than anything else. Still, Mohler
says he believes he is per-
forming a valuable service for

The Office of University
Services is having problems
accommodating persons in the
areas of women law student
housing and married housing.
Mohler says finding places that
can accommodate the growing
number of women law students
will be a problem in the future.
Right now he has four Woods
Creek Apartments and five
twin-room apartments in Baker
dorm filled with women he said.
Mohler also said the university
lacks adequate space for
married law students. He said
he forsees the possibility of the
next university apartment
complex being a married
housing complex.

The university’s lone modern
apartment facility, Woods
Creek, is doing very well, says
Mohler. All the apartments are
filled for next year, he says. He
adds enthusiastically that
students seem to like it over
there. Damage to the apart-
ments has been minimal, he
says, and when a student has
knocked in a door during a
drunken stupor he has always
come in and payed his fine like a
gentleman.

Mohler says 12 of the 40
Woods Creek apartments this
year are inhabited by law
school students. He sees a
natural trend toward more law
school students inhabiting
Woods Creek because of the

convenient location but he says
he might have to put restraints
on the trend in order to give
undergraduates a chance to live
in Woods Creek. However, he
says a time may come when he
will set aside the central
building of the complex solely
for law students.

Another trend which he sees
is a trend toward students
wanting to live on campus. A
few years ago, he says, it was
deemed glamourous to live as
far away from campus as
possible. Mohler says he
worried when students got too
far afield and likes the on-
campus trend because students
can become more a part of the
campus. Unfortunately, as
Mohler’s secretary Monica
Hoke points out, there are more
campus than there are apart-
ments on campus available for
them.

However, there should be
enough housing on campus for
next year’s freshman class. The
university is trying to work the
school size back down to a more
manageable 1,300 and will not
have to house anyone at the
Robert E. Lee Hotel as they did
this year, according to several
sources.

While next year’s freshman
class is set, this year’s fresh-
man class will continue the mad
scramble for housing. One
freshman told me, “I haven’t
even begun to think about where
I’m going to live next year.”
The Ring-tum Phi hopes this
article starts you thinking.
And dialing. And checking out
the housing list in Mr. Mohler’s
office.

Tune tastes revealed

by Rex Nyquist

Are you wondering whatever
happened to that questionnaire
you filled out for the Student
Activities Board about two
weeks ago? The one that asked
you what type of music you

liked?

Chances are you’re not,
because you probably did not
complete it. In fact, only 20 per
cent of the student body

responded to the questionnare,

so that SAB decided to discard

the survey. ‘There was not
enough response to do
anything,” said Mike Arm-
strong, Co-chairman of the
SAB.

It was the second time this
year that an SAB poll pertaining
to the musical tastes of students
were circulated and _ not
published. The results of the fall
survey were never released
because the individual who was
in charge of administering it
dropped out of school, the SAB
reported.

Nevertheless, Armstrong
thinks that it is safe to assume
that the musical preferences of

st 08482 4H 24048 288 24S

students are about the same as
they were last year, when an
SAB poll revealed slightly more
than 60 per cent of the student
body preferred rock and
variations of rock (like County
rock and progressive rock),
while slightly less than 40 per
cent enjoyed soul. A much
smaller percentage liked
Country and Bluegrass better.

Armstrong based his opinion
on a survey given to the fresh-
man class in late March and
early April. The results were
similar to last years poll; a
majority-about 60 per cent —
prefers rock music and a strong
minority — about 40 per cent
leans toward soul. He said:
“One class’ is_ pretty
representative of the other,”
and that it is safe to presume
that rock is the choice of most
Washington and Lee students.

Armstrong said that this
year’s SAB spent about $30,000
for rock bands, and perhaps
some soul groups should come
to campus next year, though
that will be up to next years
SAB.

Underhill states E.C. aims

President-elect of the student
body, Jim Underhill, believes
the honor system works, but
feels that it has some gray
areas that need to be cleared
up. He hopes that under his
administration the new E. C.
will approach this problem with
perhaps more fervor than E.
C.’s of late.

In an informal discussion with
the RtP Monday, Underhill
began by saying he disagrees
with the way in which this
year’s E. C. handled honor
cases.

“This year’s E. C. was too
philosophical in the way it
handled the honor cases. I
believe next year’s E. C. will
want to come out of the
theoretical cloud and get back
to the basics of the honor
system and stick to the White
Book. We want to restore in the
student body a sense of con-
fidence in the E. C. and impress
upon them that they have a
strong E. C. By sticking to the
White Book, I believe we can do
this.”’

Underhill also would like to
make the E. C. more accessible
to the student body. He feels
that in the recent past, the E. C.
has been out of touch with the
student body, and he wants to be
able to acquaint each student
with the E. C.’s expectations for
next year’s honor system.

“I think every student should
know the members of the E. C.,
not only ‘in a working capacity,
but also in a personal capacity.
I also believe the E. C. should
try to do something extra for the
students. I don’t know exactly
what. Maybe a bus trip to the
lacrosse playoffs, as I proposed
tonight, or possibly a party for
the student body. The big thing
is that next year’s E. C. wants to
be open to student opinion and

suggestions and would ap-
preciate input as to how to
improve our service to them.

‘“T have thought about
possibly sending E. C. members
to fraternity houses to hold
candid discussions on and about
the honor system. We’re open to
suggestions.”

Underhill continued, ‘After
conferring with some faculty
and trustees, I have decided to
conduct a survey over the
summer, independent of the E.
C. to find out from the students
just what type of shape the
honor system is in...The survey
is being conducted by the
faculty, board of trustees, and
myself, with the students
guaranteed that no risk will be
involved in it for them. The
survey will be held with no
names used. This should insure
honest responses.’’

Another goal for Underhill is
for the E. C. to acquaint the
faculty with their respon-
sibilities to the honor system
and obtain their feelings and
ideas about the system. He feels
that communication between
the faculty and E. C. has been
nonexistent and would like to
see this change.

“George (Griffin) and I plan
on going to every faculty
member and getting his views
and suggestions on the honor
system. And in some areas, we
would like for them to recom-
mend policy. Example: How
should we treat a student who
hands in an exam late? or How
do we handle a student who
makes qualitiative remarks
about an exam? The’-faculty
have been expecting us to
decide these issues and we feel
that we need their advice on
matters such as these.”

Though not wanting to speak
for the other E. C. members,

years in which the swim team
has enjoyed tremendous suc-

to attend Washington and Lee
law school, where he will be a
high freshman.

A 1967 graduate of W&L,
Capt. Miller will be heading to
Fulda, Germany where he will
serve as Personnel Officer for a
Special Administration Control
Unit. Miller was an instructor of
military history at W&L.

Maj. Kutter has been selected
to attend the Arms Forces Staff
College in Norfolk, Virginia, a

highly competitive school
operated by the Joint Chiefs of
Staff. It is equivalent to a
Masters degree, emphasizing
the joint military problems
from both a factual and
theoretical view. The school
lasts about six months, and
after that, Kutter is unsure
about his future.

Along with his military
science courses, Kutter taught a
course in the C school. He holds
a degree in corporate finance,
and has received numerous
offers at the corporate level, but
‘wants to finish out his 20 years
with the military before any
further decisions are made.

All three men have expressed
their deep appreciation to the
faculty of W&L which has been
very supportive of the
ROTC program. As Maj.
Kutter put it, ‘The institutional
philosophy of academic ex-
cellence has been integrated
into the program and it’s great.
W&L has a rich tradition in
service to the nation — whether
it be in law, politics, medicine
or the military. This has been
an overwhelming reason why
the ROTC program at
Washington and Lee is con-
sidered one of the finest
anywhere.”’

Alumni toast Lewis Hall

(continued from page 1)

since they couldn’t get Dean
Stienheimer out of it anyway he
would go ahead and make a
formal dedication.

The next speaker on the
agenda was Lewis F. Powell
Jr., associate justice of the U. S.
Supreme Court. He received a
standing ovation, quite a tribute
on such a hot day. In his
remarks he said that never
since George Washington has
such a gift meant so much to
W&L. He then rattled off an
impressive list of judges who
had attended W&L law school.
President Huntley then asked
Sydney Lewis, the man who
made it all happen, to say a few
words. After a disorganized
attempt at finding his speech,
Lewis apologized saying that
‘“‘what I had to say didn’t want
to come out of my pocket.”
Lewis told the history behind his
gift saying that after he and

Francis let it during his years’

as a student at W&L President
Gaines impressed on every
student how they were not fully
paying for their education. He
said that right after he and his
wife informed W&L of their
wish to make some con-
tribution, Dr. Jack Thomas was
knocking at their door. Lewis
said that the Huntley’s invited
them to Lexington for a
weekend which ended with a
short walk around the new
model of the law school
building. On the ride home

decided to make an investment
in the future by giving the entire
sum needed to build the law
school. Frances Lewis also
made a short speech about
loyalty and her hope and vision
for the law school. When she
was finished they gave her a
standing ovation. President
Huntley thanked them again
saying they drove an easy
bargain.

By the time Dean Steinheimer
began his speech, the sun had
taken its toll; eyes began to
close, heads fell, and the
reporters tried to get up a card
game. Then the magic moment,
it was over and all stampeded
toward the keg of choice Scotish
nectar. President Huntley
announced that this part of the
ceremony was not to have the

attributes of the American

cocktail party and that only
ceremonial portions would be
given out. The sighs of despair
echoed through the peaceful
valley. The beautiful people
mingled about with tin cups in
hand. Lunch was_ served
alfresco by the worlds infamous
Institutions Foods Co. of
Lexington.

All good things must come to
an end and this was no ex-
ception. President Huntley had
said Dr. Thomas had been
responsible for the fine
weather. Unfortunately his
heavenly bargain was not a
good one because hardly had

THE RING-TUM PHI 3

Faculty requests honor

violation stats from EC

Independent exams could be
scrapped as early as the Fall
term, said Jim Underhill at
Monday’s Executive Com-
mittee meeting. The Ring-tum-
Phi had stated last week that
the earliest possible can-
cellation of independent exams
would be in the Winter term.

Also at Monday’s meeting,
the E. C. voted 5-3, with one
abstension, to hold their annual
banquet, rarher than rescind
the money appropriated for the
party in favor of a variety of
other suggestions for its use.
The suggestions for other uses
of the money were for:
repairs on the _ universal
weight-lifting machine in the
gym, another school grain party
and transportation for students
to a lacrosse play-off game (if it
is not played at home).

Underhill said the final
determination of whether in-
dependent exams will be kept
will be made in November at a
Faculty Executive Committee
meetjng. In the meantime the
Faculty E. C. requested from
the E.C. statistics on the
number of honor violation
complaints, trials and con-
victions related to independent
exams, Underhill said. He said
the faculty would try to
determine from the statistics
whether independent exams are
harmful to the honor system.

Walt Kelly said he wondered
whether not giving the faculty
the information they desired
would prejudice them against
independent exams. Refusing to
give the faculty the information
“might alienate some swing
votes,” said Kelly.

Underhill agreed, although he
said he thought a more
“valuable” evluation of the
honor system will be a poll he,
in cooperation with the ad-
ministration, is planning to take
over the summer which will ask
students to evaluate the honor
System anonymously. He said
he believes an anonymous poll
will get honest answers.

“I don’t think we should give
the faculty anything,’’ said Rick
Goddard. The only statistic that
would be valuable for the
faculty would be the number of
convictions vs. the number of
trials, he said. The number of
honor violation complaints were
totally unfounded, said God-
dard. Even the number of
convictions vs. the number of
trials is a sort of “batting
average’, said Goddard, and
not really worthwhile in itself

because the students who were
acquitted were acquitted
because of insufficient

evidence.
Radar Davis noted that the E.

C. published similar statistics
last year and said that many
students saw the E. C. as a
“CIA-type organization”’ that is
trying to protect itself. Davis
said that the statistics ‘‘aren’t
deleterious at all’ and should be
published to show the E. C. has
nothing to hide.

Finally, two motions were
considered. The first, presented
by Neil Pentifallo, called on the
E. C. to provide the faculty with
statistics only on how many
independent exam-related
cases have gone to trial and how
many convictions have resulted
from the trials. That motion
passed 7-2. The second, sub-
mitted by Walt Kelly, called on
the E. C. to give the faculty all
the statistics they originally
requested that Passed 5-4.

Tony Carli brought a petition
to the E. C. with the signatures
of 99 students asking the E. C.
not to hold its year-end party.
He said he thought this was a
significant number of students
because he had not actively
sought out signatures but just
posted the petition in the dining
hall. He said a petition written

up by George Griffin
saying the undersigned
students would be

happy to pay for the E. C. party
out Of their own pocket had
received only 18 signatures, if
you included a variety of
profane remarks. Griffin said
he had 23 signatures on another
petition.

Walt Kelly said ‘‘Ninety-nine
people; that’s about a sixteenth
of the whole school.’’ have you
ever taken a course in
statistics,” he asked. He said
that one sixteenth of the
university is hardly a
significant number.

However Pentifallo, who
signed Carli’s petition, said he
thought the issue was important
enough to be discussed. He said
he had “‘problems”’ with the E.
C. appropriating money for its
own party. Paul Larkin also
said he felt the issue should be
discussed because students
have a legitimate gripe that
student funds are being used for
a private party, rather than for
something the whole student
body could enjoy.

Goddard suggested the $250
could be used for repairing the
universal weight-lifting
machine. Members of the E. C.
objected because the machine
belongs to the university rather
than to the student body and
because the reparations would
not cost as much as $250. They
voted down Goddard’s proposal
7-1. Underhill then suggested a
grain party for the school could
be payed for out of what is left in
the student fund — about $400,
according to Tom Hunter, E. C.
president. Then Underhill said
another possibility would be for
the E. C. to appropriate money
for bus transportation to an
away play-off lacrosse game.

Neither of Underhill’s
Suggestions were taken up
because George’ Griffin
suggested that the E. C. vote on

Entertainment Editor
The theatrical seasons of the
late 1940’s that produced Death
of a Salesman and the other
blockbuster works of Arthur
Miller and Tennessee Williams
moved into a period of steady
slump in the 1950’s. Later, a few
seasons in the early 1960’s were
dubbed by some as the most
uneventful to hit (or land upon)
New York since the turn of the
century... To say that Broad-

way was losing money at that
time was a vast un-
derstatement, as_ theatres
closed, “‘hits’’ became fewer in
number, and the financial
backers — the “angels” —
became increasingly leery of
sinking vast sums of money into
the business.

There was no Drama Critics’
Circle Award in 1963-64, nor a
Pulitzer Prize that year, though
Arthur Miller’s After the Fall
served as the critical hit of the

year. Yet, this season brought
some much-needed vitality
back to the “eternal invalid’”’ —
however brief that spasm was.
The World’s Fair, soon to open,
provided the practical initiative
in terms of millions of tourists
who could fill theatres and
make successes.

Perhaps the best example of
this enthusiasm was a musical
which soon became one of the
stage’s all-time favorites:
Hello, Dolly! Opening in this
season, the show went through a
half-dozen leading ladies and
spanned the rest of the decade,
before achieving its final glory
as a Saran Wrap motion picture
starring Barbara Streisand.
The latter star was much more
in her element in the other hit
musical play of 1963-64, Funny
Girl, her own personal rocket to
success on stage and screen.

That season’s most successful
new comedy is also the second
Washington and Lee total
theatre production for the
spring: Neil Simon’s Barefoot
in the Park. Perhaps it makes,
through its success, just as
valid a comment on_ the
American state of mind in the
mid-sixties as Death of a
Salesman in the last boom days
of the 1940’s. But its success
stems from the exact opposite
corner — because it was the
least critical toward life in this
country.

As one critic said upon
leaving a performance of the
show! ‘Barefoot in the Park
was nothing more than a minor
quarrel between two young
newly-weds spiced with the
amusing responses to the sort of
physical discomforts New

W&L’s

by Jay W. McCann

This weekend Washington
and Lee will be delightfully
unfaithful to the spirit of its
dour Calvanist founders. It is
Spring, and young men’s fan-
cies turn to..., well, sex. But,
this is the constant, unshocking,
state of affairs in Lexington.
The real news is that the annual
skin flick has arrived, and will
be shown in duPont during this
week, ‘including Friday and
Saturday at 11:00 p.m.

Actually, this year we have
the privilege of viewing a
double feature: ‘‘Wet Rainbow’”’
and “‘Slip-up.”’ “Wet Rainbow”
stars the upstanding and
irrepressible Harry Reams.
Students from Cinncinnati and
Chattanooga are warned to stay
away, lest they be
prosecuted when they return to
those jurisdictions for the
Summer. In fact, should you be
questioned by the local con-
stabulary about the late night
goings on in duPont, an S. A. B.
spokesman suggests you
memble something about
“private showings’ of “art

“Art films”

films.”

I don’t find this type of movie
entertaining in itself. The
women have that ‘“‘used’’ look,
and generally wear tatoos; the
men all look like convicts. The
amusing experience is listening
to the comments made by the
audience. These usually range
from the banal, ‘‘Rip her
clothes off!’’ to the enigmatic,
“You ain’t got no bazookas
honey!’’ Whatever either of
these statements may mean, it
is the way they are shouted that
is important. That’s the point, it
is the experience of going to a
porn flick that is essential. If
there were no porn flicks, we
would all dress up like Satyrs
and run around with giant phalli
strapped to our bodies like the
ancient Greeks.

Then again, if you can walk
down 42nd street and through
Times Square, and remain
unamazed, then maybe it is the
innocence of porn films in
Lexington that remains
fascinating.

SAB film

plans discussed

The coming year will see an
even better selection of films on
campus, according to Film
Committee Co-chairman Glen
Stanford, This is no mean task,
as this year’s group was very
well received by the student
body, and was indeed a record
year for response by students.

“Our basic plan for im-
provement for next year is
summed up in the recent SAB
questionnaire,’’ commented
Stanford. ‘“‘Obviously, the best
assurance of getting large
audiences is to cater to their
particular tastes. But, at the
same time, we will try to
provide a balance between
mystery and _ suspense,
musicals, comedy, and so
forth.”’

As always, big box-office
attractions will play a sizeable
role in the choices made. Such
recent hits as Marathon Man
and Silent Movie will be
available for rental by the fall.
And these are just two out of a
large group of new releases —
though the campus hasn’t been
without a Mel Brooks creation
or a good thriller in its lineup for
a long time.

Another movie coming up for
discussion is Gone With the
Wind, which has been visualized
for a four-night run; due to its
length, this particular film

 

“(DEATH OF A SALESMAN” —

would only allow one showing
per night. For those who
haven’t seen it aside from the
commercial-broken, small
screen version shown last fall, it
would come as a welcome
event.

And then there are the Cock-
pit movies. In the past, they
haven’t really attracted the
attention they deserved, for
some of the presentations were
of high quality. “They are
simply flicks that we don’t want
to set up for an entire
weekend,” said Stanford. One of
the movies which is almost
certain to be booked for a Cock-
pit showing is Bringing Up
Baby, a Katharine Hepburn -
Cary Grant vehicle of the late
1930’s, and undoubtedly one of
the funniest movies ever made.
Further work will be done to
enhance the appeal of the Cock-
pit as an entertainment center
by its management; a section of
booths to the left of the front
entrance is slated to be
removed to provide a stage area
for movies and live en-
tertainment.

One reminder: the movies for
the upcoming year have not
been booked definitely as yet. If
there is something you would
like to see, speak to a member
of the SAB about it soon.

illogically putting up with.
These include stair-climbing,
inadequate steam heat, and the
after-effects of an _ exotic

This very simplicity seems to
be the Neil Simon recipe for
success. His productions read
like a roll-call of all the favorite
productions at dinner theatres
in suburbs all over the country:
The Odd Couple, Plaza Suite,
Little Me, The Sunshine Boys,
and more. Audiences flock to
see his productions; in fact,
most of them begin laughing
before the curtain even goes
up...

calling the theatre at 463-9111, ext. 371.

THE NOSE KNOWS

From all reports the Lewis
Hall dedication must have been
quite a smash. If only the Nose
hadn’t had to attend another
function the same day, which
also involved drinking, but in
the pursuit of horseflesh.
Louisville is so lovely in the
Spring.

“For a time, some courtesy in
the order of approach was
observed. But the thirsty
multitude soon broke all
restraint, and armed with tin

cups, pitchers, basins, buckets
and a_ variety of dip-
pers...rushed for the barrel and
soon gave a glorius exhibition of
what free whiskey can do for the
noble creature made in the
image of God.”

Before long, however, two
men — “rolling on the ground
like swine” — knocked the keg
over, and the party was
abruptly over.

He (Jockey John Robinson,
provider of the nectar) was
aghast that ‘‘the unlimited hoi

photo by Mary Haycox
polloi should have rushed in and
perverted what was intended by
him for the taste and enjoyment
of gentlemen into a horrid riot
of the rabble.”

That is from an 1824 account
of the dedication of Washington
Hall. Except for the fact that
the university locked out the
“hoi polloi” this time, (un-
dergraduate students were not
invited) it will do to describe
last weekend. The gentry was
supplied with the tin cups,
dippers, pitchers and basins,
but the scotch whiskey flowed
like water, courtesy of Virginia
State Supreme Court Justice
Alex M. Harman.

(continued on page 10)

In a troubled decade full of
self-examination, it seems as
though the people of this
country put their feet down in
one respect. They were darned
if they were going to let their
entertainment tell them how to
live... So Laugh-In became the
nation’s top television program,
and Neil Simon had four
comedies playing
simultaneously on Broadway by
1967.

The current production here
at W&L appears to be shaping
into that same sure-fire Simon
success. It is a senior thesis
project, directed by major Bob
Carpentier. In the roles of his
newly-weds, who rent the attic
apartment in Manhattan, are
Paul Morella and Carol
Phemister. Morella’s a familiar
face to any regular of the
theatre this season, appearing
in both Uncle Vanya and
... Virginia Woolf. Ms.
Phemister made her first ap-
pearance with the UT last
season in The Visit, and we are
glad to see her return. But
providing an equally large part
of the evening’s hilarity will be

Ralph Bakshi has _ suc-

most recent production to hit

clever fantasy set ten million
years in the future. So hold on to
your hats, Sci-fi and fantasy
freaks, this flick is a definite
must.

The name of the film is
Wizards. That ought to spark
the interest of anyone with a
good imagination. The story
revolves around a world so
distant in the future that
mankind is reduced to mutants
and elevated to elves, dwarves,
and fairies. (I guess they’ll be
around forever.) The cause of

in Lex

this contrast is the inevitable
nuclear holocuast that everyone
thinks is just around the corner.

The story is the best part of
the film. I’ll give you a short
and abridged edition so I won’t
spoil it for you as it has already
left Lexington. A particular
Delhia, Queen of the Fairies,
gives birth to two male off-
spring, one a good wizard and
the other a bad one. In typical
Tolkienesque style the fantasy
unfolds. The bad wizard is
expelled by his polarized
brother to Scortch, a rather
unpleasant version of Newcomb
Hall. As Blackwolf, the bad,
vegitates there he plots revenge
upon his good brother, Avatar.
He eventually unearths secrets
from the past and learns the
scret of mass hysteria, com-
pliments of the Nazis. At this
point in the flick, it does not look
good for the elves and friends.
Mr. Bakshi resorts to some
excellent animated carnage to
get this across. The brave
Avatar and his proteges set out
on a quest to destroy the thing
that gives Blackwolf his in-
credible powers of
psychological terror. That’s
where the fun begins. I
heapheartily encourage you to
go to a ‘‘theater near you’’ and
invest the necessary amount to
see this work. You shan’t regret
it.

Baseball team ends

The 1977 baseball season has
come to a close for the W&L
Generals. The team completed
their season with a 5-18-1 over-
all mark, after dropping their
final two games last week. W&L
lost to the Liberty Baptist
Flames 14-5, and to Newport
News Apprentice 8-3.

The Flames sent 13 men to the
plate in the top of the sixth with
nine of them hitting safely to go
with one W&L error. A three-

drops last two

run homer by leftfielder Joe
Pollock was the main blow. Co-
captain Ben Bonaventura went
2-4 at the plate with a double
and triple. DH Bob Szezecinski
and second baseman John
Stagmaier also had two hits.

The Generals dropped their
final game of the season to
Apprentice despite the fact that
the visitors could come up with
only ten hits. Freshman hurler
Chip Childs was the victim of an

Fuzzballers to host
fall tournament

Already playing one of the
most difficult schedules of any
Division III school in the nation,
Coach Dennis Bussard an-
nounced last week that in Oc-
tober, W&L will host the First
Annual W&L University Fall
Invitational Tennis Tour-
nament.

In addition to the host
Generals, Ohio University, and
the Universities of Maryland
and Virginia will compete. The
tournament will be conducted in
quad fashion, with all four
schools playing each other in
head to head competition. The
177 tourney is set for October
2ist and 22nd on the W&L
courts.

The 1977 Generals split two
Division I matches last
weekend, defeating the
University of Pittsburgh 8-1,
and losing to Ohio U. 34.
Standout-freshman Stewart

Jackson won his second singles
matches in both contests, while

the number two doubles team of
captain Ken Voelker and Pat
Norris also won twice. Number
one singles player Ben Johns
won against Pitt, and took
Ohio’s Steve Navarro to the
third set before losing 7-6 with
the tie-breaker going 5-3 in
favor of Navarro.

Four W&L Generals will be
representing W&L in the
Division III National Cham-
pionships beginning on May
18th in Jackson, Miss. Johns
and Jackson carry W&L’s best
chances for national
recognition. This week, the
team has a Thursday match in
Annapolis with Navy, and plays
at Emory and Henry on
Saturday. The Generals are
currently 14-12 in dual match
action.

Most of the Washington and

came up with three runs on

Hissey had a pair of singles,
while senior right fielder Bob

After six games in '77, W&L

team managing to win two of
their last six games. W&L

track clubs expected

But there’s a new sport in town:
the first Ring-tum Phi Road
Race. The grueling 15 mile
mini-marathon has been set for
Saturday morning at 10 a.m.

According to the race’s
progenitor and organizer, RtP
editor Mike Gallagher, all the
proceeds from the two-dollar
entry fees will be given to the
Multiple Sclerosis Society.
Along with the entrants’ two
dollars, they will receive a free
tee shirt along with the right to
run the back roads of Lexington
in a trying test of muscles
versus mountains. First, second
and third place trophies will

also be presented to the stand-

outs of the race.

The race will begin at the
Lexington Court House on Main
Street. The deadline for the race
is about ten minutes before the
starter’s gun, therefore,
Gallagher has reported he
expects many last-minute
entries. He said, ‘I’m sure
there will be a number of
persons wanting to enter at the
last second just to get one of our
tee shirts, which is fine because
all the proceeds collected from
the purchase of the shirts goes
to a very needy and worthwhile
charity — the Multiple Sclerosis

Society.”’

Gallagher said the major
emphasis of the race will be on
safety while trying to provide
the entrants with some fun
competition. ‘‘We’ve had to
change the original route of the
race because at first the run-
ners were going to run part of
the race on Route 60. But after
several complaints about the
narrowness of that street, I
decided to change the the race’s
course slightly,’’ he said.

Other safety precautions have
been taken to insure the run-
ner’s safety. Monitors will be
placed at all _ strategic
crossroads to re-direct traffic
and direct the runners in the
right direction. Also, a complete
barrage of warning signs for
motorists will line the race
route. Gallagher said that the
Lexington - Rockbridge County
Rescue Squad will follow the
pack of runners as well as man
a station at the end of the 15-
mile trec to aid any winded
runners.

The Ring-tum Phi Road Race
has already attracted numerous
entrants from all around Rock-
bridge County. Gallagher said
that by Saturday, he would not

Stickmen win two
still ranked fifth

After rebounding from a 17-15
overtime loss to Maryland, the
W&L stickmen pulled off a
profitable week defeating
fourth-ranked college division
rival Roanoke College 11-8 and
Rutgers 13-8.

The outcome of both contests
was in doubt for the first half,
but as the Generals have done
so often this season, they came
on in the third quarter to seal
the victories. The Roanoke win
gave W&L the championship of
the South-Atlantic League, a
title that had gone to North
Carolina the past two seasons.
W&L defeated UNC 13-7 and
Roanoke to claim the top spot.

Roanoke is still waiting for
their first win over the

Generals, as W&L has now
beaten the Maroons nine
straight times. Washington and
Lee trailed 3-2 at the half, with
injured All-American defen-
seman Tom Keigler spending
most of the time on the bench
nursing a right arm injury.
Coach Jack Emmer inserted
“Doctor K’’ with the score tied
at 5-5, and he performed the -
operation to perfection as W&L
led 10-5 when “the Doctor”
returned to his spot on the
bench. His teammates sewed it
up on a goal by Jeff Fritz with
less than a minute to play.
Co-captain Jack Dudley and
attack Chris Kearney each had
three goals in the win, with
Chris Larson adding a goal and

Wa&L fencers parry

Hollins advances

by Pierre de Touche

The W&L Fencing Club had
its first intra-squad meet
Saturday, in which 5 fencers
from Hollins participated.
Trophies were awarded to the
ist and 2nd place finalists of the
43 match round-robin tour-
nament.

The tournament was held in
round-robin fashion rather than
direct elimination giving the
young swordsmen more ex-
perience. The fencers were
broken up into two groups with
the 2 most successful fencers
from each group meeting in a
round-robin finals match.

Will Wendt and Dave Garner
captured the two top positions
from group A, as did Herb
Jennings and Ron Brooks from
group B. Wendt, Garner, and
Jennings had little trouble in
securing their fence-off
positions, but Brooks expended
a little more energy than the
others.

At the end of regular match
play, Brooks was tied in every
way possible with Susan
Daniels from Hollins. In the
fence-off for the number 2 slot
from group B, Brooks struggled
to a 5-4 victory.

The fence-off finals were then
held with Jennings emerging as
the clear winner. His record for
the day (7-2). He was followed
by Wendt (6-2), Brooks (5-4),
and Garner (4-3). Brooks and
Wendt are co-captains this
season.

Other W&L fencers who
competed, but were eliminated
were Sam Harrison, Paul

Nathan, Bill Hill, Rob Earle.
Susan Daniel led the fencers
from Hollins with a 4-2 record in
regular match play. Other
participants were Rene
Lissiden, Terry Thomas, Lee
Travis, and Kim Charles.

Though not an inter-collegiate
meet, Coach Jim Worth feels
the meet provided a good
training experience for the
fencers.

“T feel our fencers have come
a long way since January. This
meet was a good measure of
exactly what we have and what
we need to work on for next
year. The trophies provided a
sort of incentive to do well. And
the girls, well...”

“T think the girls enjoyed this
meet as much as we did. They
had some fine fencers who
came very close to landing in
the fence-offs. Next year, they
will be a force to reckon with.”

Worth went on to comment on
next year’s plans:

“Right now we have twelve
regular fencers on the team. We
hope to attract more freshmen,
but 12 is an ideal number — 3
men and 1 alternate for each
weapon.”’ In fencing the
weapons are the foil, epee, and
sabre.

“We also will probably apply
for varsity status as a sport next
year. We aren’t really ready
now, but next year I feel we will
have the experience and skills
needed to compete against
other collegiate teams. I am
pleased with the interest
showed thus far and hope it will
increase next year.”’

Golfers improve record

by Bob Burkholder

The W&L golfers moved their
record up to 10-1 with a victory
over Bridgewater on Friday
and a win in a triangular match
on Monday over Bridgewater
and Roanoke.

The match last Friday
against Bridgewater was a real
cliff hanger. The Generals were
down after the front nine but
came back to get a five stroke
win at 396-401. The Generals
were led by Andy Fitzgerald
and Bo Moorehead with 77’s.
Andy turned in his second
straight medalist performance.
Bo played excellent golf on the
back nine and so was in-
strumental in the team’s second
half charge. Moorehead had not

competed for some time and so
his medalist performance was
doubly impressive. Jerry
Maatman was close behind the
leading Generals with a 78.
Sadrick (80), Leunig (84), and
Walter (84) were the other
contributors to the Generals
victory. Also, W&L was hin-
dered by the absence of number
two man, Gary Barousse, who
did not play because of illness.

On Monday at Roanoke the
Generals again came from
behind to nip Roanoke College
413-416. Bridgewater was buried
by both teams as they posted a
457. The high scores were
caused by strong, gusty winds,
Leading the Generals was Gary
Barousse. Barousse’s 78 was the

Track team ends season with win

The track and field Generals
completed their season with a
big 77-67 win over visiting
Bridgewater on Friday, and
ended with a overall mark of 5-
2, W&L’s best since 1973. The
team finished in third place in
the ODAC championships.

Friday’s win was eapecially

‘ satisfying because W&L had

finished behind the Eagles by
seven points in the ODAC meet
earlier in the year. W&L’s

dominance in the field events
proved the key to the victory.
The Generals swept the discus
with Phil Dunlay winning with a
toss of 129’10’’, followed by John
Miller and Hank Phillips.
Dunlay also won the shot put in
44’10”’.

Senior Tony Perry won the
high jump in 6’2’’, and finished
third in the triple jump. Paul
Hendry jumped 5’10”’ in the high
jump to finish behind Perry.

Rob Daniels threw the Javelin
154’6”’ to win that event, while
Norvell Scott took the long jump
in 22’2%’’.

Bobby Hoffman was first in
the triple jump at 43’73%4”’. John
Tucker won the 880 in 1:58.3,
while Jack Norberg won the 220
in 23.16. The Generals’ mile
relay team of Norberg, Scoot,
Tucker and Stu Atkinson
wrapped up the win with a time
of 3:28.6.

What’s a Nittany Lion?

(continued from page 6)
two assists. Senior defenseman
John Strock won the Cannon
Award for his all-around play.

The win over then seventh
ranked Rutgers was W&L’s
sixth in their last seven games,
and upped their most recent
winning streak to two games.
Seven third quarter goals
enabled W&L to up their road
record to 5-1. The score was tied
at 4-4 with five minutes gone in
the third period when the
Generals went on a tear and
tallied eight straight goals in a
matter of 15 minutes to lead 12-4
with ten minutes left.

Sophomore’ attackman
Johnny Black had two goals and
two assists in that span, and had
four goals goals on the af-
ternoon. Chris Kearney added
three goals, and Doug Fuge a
pair. W&L’s ‘‘Excitement
Plus,”’ junior goalie Charlie
Brown continued his top notch

play stopping 19 Scarlet Knight
shots and contributing two nifty
assists.

Three goals and two assists in
the two games by soph Jeff
Fritz made him the eighth
player in W&L history to score
over 50 points in one season.
Kearney had become the
seventh player two games ago.
Black, after five goals and three
assists this week, needs five
more points to pass the 50 mark.

The Generals are again
ranked. fifth in the USILA
University Division poll, tied
with Penn, and play Penn State
to end their regular season on
Saturday. Game time is 2:00
p.m. on Wilson Field,. The
Nittany Lions lead the series 4-
1, with the teams last having
played in 1963.

The NCAA _ University
Division playoffs open on
Wednesday, May 18th with the
nation’s top eight teams seeded
according to a vote of the NCAA
Selection Committee. Should
the Generals be seeded fifth,
they would play at the home site
of the fourth seeded team, right
now that being Navy. The
question is, will the selection
committee seed Maryland
second, Hopkins third, and
Navy fourth, making three of
the first four games in the
Baltimore area and possibly
hurting overall attendance. Or
could the Generals make it to
fourth, and host a first round
game In Lexington with a draw
of 5,000-7,000 almost guaran-
teed. The semifinals are
scheduled for May 21st, with the
championship game set for May
28th in U. Va.’s Scott Stadium.

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

FAREWELL

Bill Noell’s resignation announcement this week
has made me feel this is indeed a sad occasion for the
university.

Dean Noell gave many years of his life to
Washington and Lee and I am sure he will have many
fond meories of them. As an undergrad, Noell served
the school as President of the student body. He was a
Phi Beta Kappa, ODK, and a Fulbright scholar.

His seven years on the faculty were spent as pre-
law advisor, director of financial aid, associate
Director of Admissions, associate Dean of Students,
secretary of Phi Beta Kappa, and the job he created
— coordinator of the freshman year.

As can be seen from his credits, he no doubt has
served the university in many ways. Yet, perhaps the
most important way in which he served W&L cannot
be typed up in a resume,and this is the way in which
every other student and who have had contact with
him will remember him.

I first came in contact with Dean Noell as a fresh-
man before matriculation when he delivered a speech
to my class during the Lee Chapel seminar. He talked
about the honor system, tradition, and the true
gentleman. By the end of the talk, it was evident to
everyone that the then-emotional Noell had delivered
his speech from the deepest realms of his heart. Not
only was he moved by his own speech, but every
freshman who walked out of Lee Chapel that day, felt
proud to be a student at Washington and Lee.

As far as I am concerned, Bill Noell epitomizes the
W&L gentleman standards that Robert E. Lee
described nearly a century ago. Noell is a very high-
minded and principled individual and brings that
attitude to others around him. He has a knack for
presenting the traditions and ideals of an old southern
university in modern terms to scared groups of im-
mature freshmen. Noell always leaves an individual
with the idea that he expects the best from that
person. Yet if the person fails to live up to these ex-
pectations, he will not be angry nor will he exhibit
disappointment, but only give encouraging words of
advice.

In his new job, Noell will have the opportunity to
combine the experience he gained here with his law
skills. Many new opportunities will open for him, and
for this reason, I am happy for him. I am sad for the
university, not only because everyone here will be
loosing the closeness of his friendship, but also a part
of the institution. Washington and Lee just won’t seem
to me the same without him.

LETTERS TO ED

Responses to editorial outcry

Editors:

On Friday, May 6, I was
surprised to read the editorial
by J. Michael Gallagher con-
cerning the Honor System. He
spoke of the Honor System as
being a facade, that it actually
doesn’t work and should be
abolished. Mr. Gallagher, a
man whom I thought had
common sense, included many
hard facts in his writing, but he
spoiled his work by calling for
the abolition of the System. He
offered no solution, instead he
took a very dishonorable way
out of a serious problem.

Let’s start at the beginning.
First, there allegedly have been
an unusual amount of violations
this year. Notes, exams, sports
equipment and more have
disappeared. The seriousness of
this isn’t known until one is a
victim of such a crime. As to
why these violations weren’t
reported, Gallagher wrote that
1. they weren’t important
enough, 2. nothing would come
of it or 3. the alleged offender
wouldn’t be convicted. The first
reason is easily answered by
saying that any violation, no
matter how small, is important
enough to report to the Com-
mittee. It is the second and third
reasons that start me thinking.
If it is the common opinion that
nothing will come of the
violation and the offender would
not be convicted, and this
opinion is actually the case,
then the problem rests with the
E. C. This would seem to imply
that the E. C. is ineffective and
unable to uphold the law. But I
refuse to believe this because of
the high calibre of these elected
persons sitting on the Com-
mittee. So the problem turns
again to the students.

There are people who are
committing violations and there
are those who know of violations
but never report them. There is
in effect a ‘‘coverup.” If one
talks, he could implicate
himself, or be the object of peer
pressure, so one doesn’t talk.
This all brings back memories

Editor:

As a Class Agent and former
Editor, I have been receiving
The Ring-tum Phi and just
wanted to tell you how much I
have enjoyed and appreciated
the efforts of you and your
associates.

The new format, as displayed
in the April 21st issue, is very
refreshing. I believe it offers
great possibilities. The use of
more pictures, the opportunity
for catching headlines, and a
more compact publication is the
most exciting thing that’s
happened to the publication in
many years. Hope you take full
advantage of it.

It certainly is cleaner, lends
itself to imaginative jour-
nalism. Proof-reading seems to
have improved which was long
over due. Inasmuch as_ the
publication must go to secon-
dary schools and _ other
universities, this is a golden
opportunity to create a fine
impression.

What bothers me really is the
apathy that seems to exist on
the campus. Remarks such as
“a sleepy Southern university
like W&L written by a Dee Dee
Warren — _ is __ bother
some. The behavior of fans at
lacrosse games equally an-
noying. Can’t tell you any
solution, but you probably know
most of the reasons for these
things. Any way of turning some
of these around? We were a

pretty Class School — thought

we still were — now I wonder.
Consider listing the classes
when you show staff. Might help
foster a long overdue class unity
which may be part of the
problem. Whatever, forgive my
rambling. You’ve done one
helluva fine job.
Cordially,
Donald S. Hillman ’46

Editor:
The staff of the RtP should be
complimented, perhaps

because of the new format and
leadership or both, for finally
reporting events as they ac-
tually happen. For instance,
last week the anger of several
frustrated students was
relieved. An excellent article
remembering the ‘‘Promise of
the Dope Meeting” makes one
inclined to concur with J. M.
Gallagher’s “‘realization’’ of the
joke of the Honor System. For
one, can ““W&L gentlemen’ lie?
Also, aren’t elected officials on
the Student Control Committee
responsible to their classmates
and-or the Executive Com-
mittee?

Furthermore, another issue
reported was the E. C.’s
“Hilarious actions’ for the
second consecutive week. In
question in this week’s episode
was the money appropriated for
the E. C. banquet and Mr.
Underhill’s high level of
audacity. Discussing the former
with a peer, the following
question was posed: If the E. C.
achieved something this year,
don’t they deserve a party? The
answer is undoubtedly in the
negative. The E. C. is a
voluntary committee. In-
dividuals are not forced to run
for it. Granted, the work load is
heavy, but the candidates know
that beforehand.

As a result, instead of the
petition demanding that the E.
C. not hold a banquet using
student funds, perhaps those
students signing the opposing
petition should, indeed, make a
collection for the Executive
Committee banquet. And while
they’re at it, maybe some extra
money could be collected ‘for
Mr. Underhill’s car, too!

Underhill

(continued from page 2)
Underhill feels that a change
possibly will be made in policy
concerning Lexington related
law offenses vs. W&L rleated
offenses overseen by the
Student Control Committee.

“This year’s E. C. seems to
have made a distinction be-
tween Lexington and related of-
fenses and honor violations at
W&L. Of course, as specified in
the White Book, we must follow
the opinions of the present
student generation in deter-
mining what constitutes an
honor violation. I personally
can see no distinction between
violations that occur off campus
and campus related violations.
Of course, each case must be
treated separately, but I think
the members of next year’s E.
C. feel the same way, though I
really can’t speak for them.”

All in all, Underhill wants a
stronger, stricter, and more
efficient honor system. He
believes that any honor
violation, whether it be lying,
cheating, or stealing is a
dishonorable act and should be
punished by expulsion.

‘Washington and Lee is
comprised of honorable gen-
tlemen. If we had graduated
penalties for honor violations, in
essence, we would be admitting
that dishonorable individuals
resided in our community. I
don’t believe the honor system
can exist with anything but the
maximum penalty.”

of Watergate. Senator Lowell
Weiker of Connecticut made an

important point when he said |

that while the legal system had
been breached, it also showed
that it worked, and justice was
being set down. The criminals
had been discovered by the
system, and the system was
dealing with them. There is a
relation here with the Honor
System. Although it is oc-
casionally violated, the system
is capable of working ef-
ficiently, if we all share the
responsibility.

Mr. Gallagher mentioned the
“strong influence’ the Honor
System had on on his choice of
college. It weighed heavily in
my choice also. That’s why I
have trouble understanding his
suggestion to abolish the Code,
or looking at it in a different
view, to allow dishonesty. I
would take a more optimistic
stand. Keep the System and
take new steps’ toward
educating the students and
being more stringent with
alleged violators. Abolition of

the “System would only com-

pound the problem.

Mr. Gallagher is capable of
being a good editor of the Ring
Tum Phi in the next year. I
would only hope that he use

better discretion when writing
his editorials to be read by so
many people. He must now
realize that his opinion will be
the basis of many others. If he
respects this school as he says,
he must show it in his words.
Sincerely,

The Nose knows all

And speaking of rolling in the
muc like swine, the Nose sniffed
out the fact that one of our noted
alumni who sits on the high
council known as the Board of
Trustees was doing that very
thing Thursday night at
Zollman’s while in the pursuit of
lovely young things from the
Buena Vista School for Young
Ladies and Husbandless
Homemakers. When the clock
struck twelve and they all
turned into pumpkins, he
returned to the abode of one of
our very own gentlemen
students in pursuit of liquor and
more women. Alas, he was
felled by John Barleycorn
before the night grew much
older, Oh, the exuberance of our
forgotten youth.

What is worse, Thursday
night’s revels were not enough,
and the search for pleasures of
the flesh continued on Friday.
But even a Trustee learns that,
contrary to the catalog, dates
are not easy to find during the
last three weeks of Spring
Term. Of course, he has an out,
and our subject took off for the
nation’s captial where the flesh
is caught with a lot less pursuit.

And how is this for a
descriptive phrase? ‘‘He’ll Dick
Nixon you to death by talking all
around the question.” Don’t
know who was being discussed,
but the vividness of this phrase
is such that no one can possibly
survive the post-Watergate era
without adding it to their
vocabulary.

Then there is the completely

unfounded rumour that a
certain Hollins fencer took after
one of our recently elected E. C.
officials with a bottle instead of
a foil. She missed, but the light
pole has an awfully big dent.
“I want her body” was our
editor’s comment on seeing the
picture of W&L’s own Multiple
Sclerosis pin-up girl. Just
proving that the Nose plays no
favorites. We report the dirt on
anyone and everyone. Of
course, the Nose could use some
help. Just drop your gossip
under the Phi door. In a sealed
envelope please, with your
name, so the facts can be
verified by our hard-working
news staff. All sources will be
protected as tips are burned
after reading. No letter bombs,

please.

by Joe Dubuque
What’s all the shouting fer?
Well if you didn’t notice, May 1,
Al Black Day, passed by with
only a few whimpers. May 1.

also traditionally the
celebration of the Soc-
ialists eminent vic-

tory, marks the date of spon-
taneous frivolity here at W&L.
Some say that the forgotten
observance of this hallowed
tradition marks a decline in
college life. Only the present
Generals can remedy this sad,
sad malady.

What the !Xi, 2X0 is Al
Black? Well the class of ’77 may
remember him as he was
triumphantly hailed when he
again entered Lexington in the
spring of 1974. The SAB ap-
propriated the full amount of
travel for this awesome here to
return. Even the calendar of my
catalogue showed May 1 as his
own day. It seems Al Black was
a somewhat shy, studious
Senior when somehow,
somewhere, everyone started
chanting his name. he had
never been so popular in his life,
so it seemed. Even today no one
knows why he was picked. Was
it his emerging maturity as a
revolutionary? Robert E. Lee
might have said, ‘Twas his
duty.”” To do what? To Lead!

Wherever he went, his name
was shouted with glee. The
Dining Hall especially became
a voice box. Just like a prison
with shouts to kill, the dining
hall boomed with chants for Al
Black.

Well in 1974, when he arrived
after a victorious spring the
year before, all still knew his
name. On the night of May 1, the
loyal. followers met in the
Freshman old quad. Al Black
seemed ready to launch his mob

against the institutions of

Lexington. Often, during his
speech, cries like “‘you big fish”’
or ‘‘Goose’’ were heard—
besides many obscenities. Even
a beer can was thrown from the
fourth story exuberantly at him.
Luckily he avoided disaster by
ducking his head. He convinced
all to parade down Main Street
while a few held him on their
shoulders.

Next the mob went to the
gates of VMI. The cadets,
forewarned of his assault, layed
ready with their weapons. The
crowd, number ing the hun-
dreds pressed against the
barrack gate, but officers and
many screaming’ cadets
prevented entry. After a motion
by the cadets to draw back, a
large torrent of water streamed
down, not on the mob, but on the

officers who stood there.

Then the great leader said
“To the Law School’”’ There his
carriers threw him on a table.
He called for a trip to Sweet
Briar. Shouts of ‘‘Get none”’
followed. Thereafter the en-
thusiastic Generals filling the
first floor of Tucker Hall
marched to the library, then to
the President’s House.

After minutes of loud chan-
ting and frivolous laughter, the
President emerged in his
nighttime attire. Violently the
crowd shouted for a holidday.
President Huntley’s reply was
hailed with ecstacy for a few
moments. He said yes, school
could be cancelled...‘‘until 8:00
tomorrow.”

Still, Al Black vowed to go to
Sweet Briar, but as a strong
leader, he compromised ‘‘To
Southern Seminary.’’ Shouts
were followed by cries of
“Hungry Hill.” Then began the
largest car caravan in
Lexington’s history. State
Police, and local police passed
lines of cars and “moons” all
the way to B. V. The police
barricaded the entrance with
their cars. But behold! The
Generals, using great strategy
rushed the hill in numbers after
parking! Then came down the
fire ladders, doors flew open,
and a large scale invasion of the
dorms insued. Exploding
fireworks, buckets of water
heaved from windows, and fire
extinguisher fights marked the
persence of the assault.

Now, three years later, this
seems only a memory for the
Class of ’77. Can the lack of
cheer be a reflection upon the
Class of ’78, ’79, ’80? Can this
great tradition of revolution
somehow fade in the tide of C-
School seriousness? I hope not.
Generals of W&L, Go Wild!

Near disaster on Vulcan Alcedo

(continued from page 1)
recommence at three, ending
for dinner around six. An 8:30 or
9:00 bedtime became habit
because of the rigors of living on
the Equator.

Tuesday, April 12th, broke
with the daily routine, and was
a day which signified the
beginning of an adventure the
eight members of group one will
never forget. Leaving Dr. Hick-
man on the boat, John Collums,
Rob Bates, Bob Ottenritter,
Howdy Knipp (the camel), Ed
Gerhardt, Lee Ginsburgh, Tuck
Laffitte, and Kirk Ruffin, set off
for a three-day research ex-
pedition up the Vulcan
Alcedo (3600 ft.) to look at the
Galapagos tortoises. With them
they took enough food for the
trip, two gallons of water each,
no maps, and just one compass.
The climb was made more
arduous by the 50-60 pound
packs on their backs, the
sweltering heat, and the lack of
a trail.

One and a half miles into the
trip, their guide, Gail Davis,
realized the climb would be too
difficult, so she turned back,
decided to return to the beach,
and wait for three days. Now
without a guide, the W&L
students continued their assent
of the voleanic mountain. Tuck
Laffitte recorded in his journal
that ‘our instructions were to
follow goat paths until they
crossed a ravine to the left of
the ferns.”’ Following donkey
trails up a sheer, verticle climb,
the group ran into ferns over
five feet high: ‘‘At times we
would have to fall down on the
ferns and stand up again to
progress at all. There was no
way to walk.”

Exultation swept through the
group when they reached the
top at 4:30 — after seven hours
of difficult climbing. Camp was
made at 5:30, just as a fog
started to settle in. The group
was too tired to eat much. They
bedded down for the night with
high winds pulling at their tents.

‘“‘At sunrise, we broke camp
and headed for our second camp
sight, 90 degrees around the
rim. The path varied from
2% feet wide rockwide rock
walls to turtle paths, including
breaks in the walls to get past.
Each wall took a little more
strength, but we got there by
9:30.”

The second day was spent
studying the Galapogos Tor-
toises in the caldara —
whereever they could be found.
The crater was very dry, and
the water the explorers carried
with them disappeared rather
quickly. It took nearly an hour
anda half to scale the southwest
wall of the caldara. Ed
Gerhardt found a scorpion, but
no one was anxious to go back to
see it.

An impromptu celebration
was held that night. Everyone
ate at least some dinner, and
most of the food and water was
consumed. Spirits were
high...the trip was almost over.
That dinner was the last meal
the group had for the next two
days.

Morning of the third day:
“We broke camp early and
without breakfast. We had
planned to return to the beach,
not by retracing our original
path, but,hopefully, by leaving
the rim earlier and spiraling
down the volcano in a coun-
terclockwise fashion heading to
the northeast.”’ Each of the
seven (Lee Ginsburgh, weighed
down by heavy camera
equipment, had returned to the
beach the first day) had only
one or two quarts of water. The
group followed goat and turtle
paths, thinking that they were
following the same trail Kirk
Ruffin had used two years
previous.” But the path got
worse as they went along.

“After five hours of constant
(descent), we became aware
that the ground was not drop-
ping as fast as it should have.
We were caught up in an area of
tropical plants. Until we got to a
lower elevation, the flora wasn’t
going to change, and we could
make no better than about half
a mile an hour in the brush as it
was.”’ So they trailblazed
through the dense, chest-high
ferns. The terrain had leveled
off, but the group found
themselves in a jungle with no
trail to follow. One person would
break ahead to clear a trail until
he could go no further, then
someone else would take the
trailblazing chore.

At one o’clock in the af-
ternoon, the group rested for an

hour. It was decided that the
remaining water should be
rationed. No one was allowed to
drink without the consent of all.
They were in the middle of a
jungle-like plain. Deep ravines
had prevented them from going
the desired direction, and they
were forced by the terrain to go
southeast. Returning to the
original trail was out of the
question; they were too far
away and it would be an up-hill
climb. Their only wish was to
get to the shore.

After each man had said a few
words of encouragement, the
seven set off again, this time by
compass. It was a_ slow,
exhausting struggle through the
jungle. Insects, foliage barring
their way, the intense heat
burning their skin — and no
water to cool their parched
throats or refill their body’s
depleted water reserves. They
pushed for four hours by the
needle of the compass, knowing
that the second group was
waiting for them on the beach
with food and water.

They took many rests that
afternoon. They were all weak
and thirsty. Most had not really
eaten for three days. It had all
seemed so easy the night
before. But at eight o’clock on
the evening of the third day, the
situation was getting desperate.
There was very little water and
almost no food. They tried to
hike by flashlight for half an
hour. They had a flare for
emergencies to signal the ship,
but it was too foggy to be seen.
They built a bonfire, but they
knew it could not be seen more
than 50 yards away. They were
weak and hungry and tired and
hot. Their mouths were dry.
Their throats burned from lack
of moisture. No one slept that
night. “‘We stared at the sky and
prayed for the clouds overhead
to rain.” Later in the night, the
clouds drifted away and the sky
was clear.

Dawn of the fourth day began
with a flare for help sent up in
the hope that the ship would
spot it. They started off again
with one quart of water
remaining for the seven of
them. Spirits were low and

almost everyone was resigning
himself to a fate which seemed
increasingly inevitable. The
consensus was for building a
fire and waiting for rescue. It
was already getting hot.

Tuck Laffitte climbed a tree
and spotted shore about three
hours away. From the tree, he
could also tell that the fire they
had built would not be spotted
from the ship; a large land rise
blocked the view. There was no
way they could be found. Laf-
fitte announced his intention of
leaving, much to everyone’s
dismay. After some discussion,
Laffitte left with Howdy Knipp
and half the water in search of
rescue.

Alone together, the two
cleared the heavy brush
(without packs)in an hour, and
crossed a lava field by nine. The
hot sun forced them to the
water, where they cooled off:
“It felt as good as food at the
time. But we had to move on.
We had to have food. Our water
was thick with saliva from
spitting back into it. It kept us
going.’’ They killed a sea lion
and tried to drink the blood, but
were repulsed. They continued
northward.

The five they had left behind
were under a tent flap for extra
shade. Their water was gone by
noon. They had begun saving
their urine, hoping to distill it —
possibly to drink it. The cac-
tuses and vines around them
were dry because it had not
rained for three months.

In the heat of the day, Knipp
and Laffitte rested in caves
along the coast. Their vision
was blurred for lack of food and
water. They no longer sweated
because they had nothing to
sweat anymore All they could
do was inch their way north,
and rest when they could not
continue. Laffitte writes: ‘TI
was worried about getting out in
time to help the others. I was
worried about getting out at

all.”

They spotted the boat at 2:30,
and were picked up fifteen
minutes later. In between gulps
of water, the pair directed the
captain to the island they had
used as a reference point for
locating the others. Rescue
teams were sent out to search
with water, flares, chocolate,
and flashlights.

With only minutes of daylight
left, the five were found and the
important operation of food and
water delivery was carried on
during the night. At 8:30, on the
morning of the fifth day, all of
Group One was returned to the
ship. Still shaken by the in-
cident, all seven spent the next
few days recuperating, and
trying to regain the 15-20 pounds
of weight they had each lost.

It had been a trying ex-
perience. An experience which
had forced each of them to
rethink and reevaluate many
important thoughts in their
minds. Those two days taught
all seven of.them more about
themsely@ssand others, than

any other single experiencé in™”

their lives. Of course their trip
was not over. They did not

return until the end of April. But »,

to relate the mundane ad-
ventures after the Vulcan
