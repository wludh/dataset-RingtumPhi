Underhill is prez;
Griffin is veep;
sec picked teday

Jim Underhill will be president
and George Griffin will be vice-
president of the Executive Com-
mittee, and a run-off today will de-
termine who becomes next year’s
secretary.

Today's run-off will be between
Neil Pentifallo and Kevin Lamb.
Pentifallo was the leader in Mon-
day’s election with 310 votes to
Lamb’s 234 votes. Tom McCarthy
received 223 votes.

Underhill, who was unopposed
on the ballot, beat write-in candi-
date Joe Fitzgerald. Underhill had
424 votes, Fitzgerald 39 votes.

Griffin, also unopposed, out-
polled write-in candidate Howard
Rubel 375 votes to 77 votes.

The final results of the voting
on the three amendments on the
ballot were not available at press
time but the Ring-tum Phi has
learned that only the proposal to
disenfranchise seniors was failing
as of Monday’s voting.

The amendment was favored by
192 voters and opposed by 273.
The proposal to move freshman
elections ahead two weeks was
passing (279-190) as was the
amendment giving the E. C. the
power to remove a candidate from
the ballot for breaking E.C.-im-
posed campaign rules (202-190).

Although both amendments
were passing, neither had the two-
thirds majority needed for addi-
tion to the constitution.

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, MARCH 10, 1977

   

Kevin Lamb, George Griffin, Neil Pentifallo and Jim Underhill were
winners or near-winners in Monday’s election. A runoff for secre-

6 vie for 2 IFC posts

There are six candidates for the
presidency and vice-presidency of
the  Inter-Fraternity Council.
Nominations were received Tues-
day night, and the election will be
held Monday, March 14, in the
Co-op and in Washington Hall.

Candidates for president are
Steve Jones, a sophomore at Phi
Kappa Psi; Carter Greer, a mem-
ber of Kappa Alpha; and Rob Sult
of the Phi Kappa Sigma house.
Running for Vice-President are
Marshall Jemison of Sigma Chi;
Howdy Knipp, a member of Delta
Tau Delta; and Peter Quinn of
Sigma Phi Epsilon.

Jones said he thinks the IFC
has become a small organization
that has alienated a lot of frater-
nities. He would like to see a more

Fancy Dress

by LEE HOWARD

To avoid crowding at Fancy
Dress, the Student Activities
Board should limit ticket sales to
one per W&L student and open
up more of the student center,
said Mike Armstrong, co-chairman
of the SAB, at Monday’s Executive
Committee meeting.

Armstrong suggested moving
the main entrance to Fancy Dress
to another door so that Fairfax
Lounge could be better utilized.
The library, EC room and game
room could also be used, he said.

The only problem with opening
up more rooms, he said, is that
Fancy Dress will be much more
expensive. It will mean that more
rooms will have to be decorated
and that the SAB will probably
want to have something going on
in every room, he said.

Armstrong said 3,500 persons
attended this year’s Fancy Dress
as opposed to 2,600 in 1976. This
year’s Fancy Dress made money,
he said, although he did not have
the exact figures because some
bills were still outstanding. He
said they took in almost $2,000 at

the door.

A question was raised by Jacob
Jones about a party the SAB put
on for its members during Fancy
Dress. Armstrong acknowledged
the party and said the SAB spent
about $80 on it. Jones moved that
the EC have some way to control
the party expenditures to avoid
abuse.

SAB members argued that they
worked very hard, devoting al-
most all their time during the
week previous to the ball working
on decorations. They also argued
that they were already entrusted
with a large amount of money—
thousands of dollars in fact—and
could certainly be entrusted with
$80. Jones’ motion was voted down
10-1.

Armstrong also announced at
the meeting that there will be not
one, but two “porn flicks” in the
spring.

He also said the SAB has about
$13,000 in total funds right now
and that the Springs Weekend is
the only big event remaining. The
original budget estimate for
Springs Weekend was $6,000.

communication between the IFC
and individual houses could help
alleviate disunion.

Greer said that his experience
as secretary and president of the
KA house, along with the role he
played in that chapter’s reactiva-
tion at W&L, could help him ef-
ficiently maintain and improve
the fraternity system on campus.

Sult would like to see the IFC
regain the governing power it
once had. He thinks his service as
junior justice of the IFC Board
and treasurer of the PKS House
has given him a working knowl-
edge of fraternities.

Marshall Jemison is running
for vice-president for a similar
reason. He said the IFC has lost a
lot of prestige on campus and he
would like to see it regained. His

on how to approach the IFC’s
problems in the coming year.

Knipp has attended the IFC
meetings all year as a representa-
tive from the DTD house. He has
a keen interest in fraternity life
and would like to participate in it
more fully.

Quinn’s reasons for running are
to bring new blood into the lead-
ership of the IFC and to encour-
age fraternities to behave in a
more gentlemanly manner. He has
served as secretary and president
of his house, and was named the
Outstanding Fraternity Freshman
by the IFC in 1975.

The elections for the remaining
IFC offices—secretary, treasurer,
rush chairman, and junior and
senior justices—will be held
March 22 at the IFC meeting.

W&L bids for federal grant;
Washington Hall keeps mum

by WILLIAM H, EDMISTEN

Washington and Lee has sent a
proposal to the National Science
Foundation requesting a $250,000
matching grant for a new comput-
er system and has declined to
make the proposal public.

The proposal calls for W&L to
purchase the computer and ter-
minals while the $250,000 NSF
grant would be used mostly to pay
operational personnel, computer
programmers and special consul-
tants, according to Assistant Dean
of the College Robert W. McAh-
ren, who sent the proposal to the
NSF.

The proposal includes plans for
a statistical package which could
be used by students in the natural
and social sciences. Simulation
programs would be developed for
the social sciences, including the

Outing Club revival may bring
coed canoe trip with Hollins

by BOB RATHBUN

In a continuing effort to bring
the wholesome aspects of life to
the W&L student body, the Outing
Club will sponsor a series of out-
door programs in the spring.

Working with “Wilderness Chal.
lenge,” a Roanoke organization
based on the same principles as
“Outward Bound,” the club hopes
to enable the interested student to
take part in small group outdoor
learning experiences.

Possible programs include a
ropes and balance course, a two-
day rock climbing course, white
water canoeing and various camp
ing expeditions.

An organizational meeting to
gauge student response will be
held in duPont auditorium at 7:30
p.m. next Thursday. Warren Dav
is, a representative of “Wilderness
Challenge,” will give a slide pre
sentation detailing the program

Diversity wins over theme in Contact

JOHN BRUCH and TOM MURPHY —

CO-CHAIRMEN OF CONTACT
by DAVID W. TALLEY, JR.

R-tp: Why is there no theme this year?

Bruch: Primarily because of what Tom and J
have viewed from the past two years, and Tom's
three years, that the Contact programs have had a
theme. but it has been superficial. We saw Contact,
when we ran for the program last spring before the
EC. as a university lecture series and not so much a
symposium as it has been billed in the past Also, it
is the main means to bring prominent speakers from

various fields to the campus,

R-tp: Why are the speakers so spread out?

Murphy: We spread the program out from Janu
ary to April beeause we assumed that students, fac
ulty members, and local people will have more time
in ‘which threy can drop by and enjoy different
speakers, whereas before, you had so many people
coming together that it was difficult for us to enjoy
all the sources. We hope this will present a diver
sified program that will appeal te people at differ

ent times threughout the year

R-tp: How has the chapel closing affected the

program’
Bruch: Greatly

during the final week of classes
Murphy: Unfortunately

It was closed from Feb. 7 to
March 7, and that wiped out a whole month for us
which was prime time because another one of our
considerations was to try to get away from having
speakers or a speaker here during mid-term time or

this closing of the cha

pel has caused us to put more speakers in March,
we'll have three, and that is one of the things we
were trying to get away from. However. there wasn't

much choice except going to VMI or going to the
gym. We'll go to the gym for Bruce Jenner and per
haps for Tom Wolfe, but we feel it wouldn't be a
proper facility for the other speakers, so the chapel
closing did cause quite a bit of trouble

R-tp: Are your publicity problems worked out?

Murphy: We had a terrible publicity problem
In so far as organizing, it has been worked out. Bob
Keefe works with us very closely now and he's going

to release all the information through his office

something I didn't know was available, and it has

and | can't see a change in that

R-tp: How did you choose these particular speak

mary concern was to attract top leaders in various
fields, and | think a
we've done that. Several of the speakers Tom and |
knew about through private contacts, and the other
people we agreed on to go after

and answer any questions.

Rick Stein, president of the Out-
ing Club, emphasized the neces-
sity for all interested students to
attend the meeting. “If we don’t
get a good turn out for the meet
ing we'll have to cancel the pro-
gram,” Stein said. “This guy won't
come back if nobody comes to the
meeting so we've only got one
chance to take advantage of this
opportunity.”

A fee for the programs will be
charged but Stein said he was not
sure what that would be. “It all
depends on how many people
want to participate and what they

want to do,” he said.

A white water canoe trip has
been tentatively scheduled for
April 29th through May 1. This ex-
pedition will combine W&L and
Hollins students. “This should be
our biggest event,” Stein said “and
it will be limited to a certain num
ber of participants.”

Besides discussing the “Wilder
ness Challenge” programs, anyone
interested in joining a turkey call
ing class to be held this spring by
Professor McDaniel can sign up.

New Outing Club officers will
also be elected at the March 17
meeting.

chology, Sociology and Politics.
But the NSF will decide on the
proposal no sooner than May 20,
according to McAhren.

Dean of the College William J.
Watt refused to allow the Ring-
tum Phi to view the twenty-page
grant request proposal but said
it will be public if approved by
the NSF. Last year a similar grant
request proposal for $300,000 was
rejected by the NSF.

Watt said secrecy prevents
other schools in competition for
the grant from knowing “what
your plans are.” When asked if
this was the main reason for sec-
recy he said “No.” The main rea-
son is that (the proposal) is a per-
sonal communication between
W&L and the National Science
Foundation, just like a letter.”

It is standard practice for
schools and the NSF to keep un-
successful grant requests secret,
according to Dr. E. F. Turner,
who will become Project Director
of the grant if it is approved by
the NSF and W&L.

McAhren said acceptance of
$250,000 from the federal agency
would not obligate the University
beyond matching the money at an
undisclosed ratio. He said Title 9
of the Amendment to the Higher
Education Act of 1972 forbids
schools with sex discrimination in
admission policies from accepting
grants. But MecAhren said histori-
cally single-sex schools are ex-
empt from that provision.

Dr. Turner said the type of com-
puter for the system has not been
selected and he knows of no other
sources of grants if the NSF pro-
posal is rejected.

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The New Guard

The results of Monday's Big Three elections came as no
surprise, and as no disappointment either, Mr. Underhill and
Mr. Griffin have, during this past year, acted as voices for clear
thinking on an Executive Committee with a reputation for

muddled ~ histrionics.

1 wondered at first why Mr. Griffin had decided to run for
vice-president, instead of shooting for the presidency. Then |
reread Mr. Underhill’s comment about “enlarging the role of
the vice-president and jumped to the conclusion that some sort
of deal had been made belore the campaign began, Grifhn
agreeing to accept the number two post if Underhill promyised
to sweeten it with a littke more power, if they were elected. 1
hope neither of them lost any sleep on that account.

Even if this is true, it hardly matters. Underhill and Grifln
were not responsible for the fact that no one else filed petitions
to run for the “Big Two.” Splitting the offices between them
seemed the best way to insure capable and responsible leader-
ship in both, Neither could have foreseen the last-minute en-
wies of Joe Fitzgerald and Howard Rubel.

These two last-named individuals deserve some credit lor
entering the race at all. Whether or not they necessarily be-
lieved themselves better qualified than their opponents, Fitz
gerald and Rubel at least believed strongly enough in the worth
of their government to involve themselves directly in the demo-
cratic process. Where were all the others?

The secretarial race was hotly contested from the start, and
the final tally shows it: Pentifallo 310, Lamb 234, and McCarthy
223. How this result justifids a runofl between Pentifallo and
Lamb is beyond me, considering McCarthy's extremely close
finish and the gap between Pentifallo and the other two candi-
datee. Anyway today’s the day for that runoff.

The probable outcome of the secretarial race (barring «
substantial shift in support), coupled with the results of the
presidential and vice-presidential elections, will mean a new
guard which is virtually indistinguishable trom the old. “This is
not necessarily undesirable, yet a few new faces in student gov-
ernment are always welcome and can provide some perspectives
that may be lost in an otherwise stagnant and self-perpetuat-
ing system. Election for E.C. class representatives will be held
this Spring. Here is another opportunity (how many do you
want?) for concerned students to get involved. Let's hope that
there will be more interest in that election than in the last.

Letter Uo The Editor

Dear Sirs:

Our letter is in reply to your
“Fancy Thanks” editorial of
March 3. First let us say that we
did have a good time Friday night
in spite of the SAB.

However, the SAB could have
done much to improve the even-
ing. which we feel did not mea-
sure up to the 1976 version. The
most obvious problem is the long
delay in being admitted. It is ab-
surd to wait in line one hour and
fifteen minutes, as we did, to at-
tend a four and one-half hour
event. The wait would have been
unendurable if the weather had
been inclement.

There are several solutions to
the problem. One could limit tic-
ket sales to a reasonable number
and offer them on a first come,
first serve basis, with a person
only being able to purchase two
tickets at a time—his name being
taken for a future checklist. Al-
ternatively, ticket sales could be
limited to W&L students, faculty,
staff and alumni with the afore-
mentioned two ticket limit per
person.

At any rate, no tickets should
be sold at the door at all, Anybody
can purchase their tickets before-
hand. Surely, even alumni can
write the SAB for tickets if they
do not live near Lexington. Addi-
tionally, selling tickets at the door
creates a bottleneck, since making
change or writing checks certainly
takes more time than simply
stamping a ticket. We overheard
Mike Armstrong try to mollify a
disgruntled, long-waiting ball
voer, His excuse was that over one
hundred tickets had been sold at
the door. The solution to this
problem is plainly evident

To further alleviate the admit
tance problem, we would like te
suguest that the SAB originally
plan te have at least two entrances
to the ball open. The belated open
ing of a second entrance on Fri-
day night was the only thing that
managed to get the line moving at
all. Originally having two en
trances would shorten the line
from the beginning and avoid
hastily set up stop gap measures

As to the decorations being

lavish” (tt P. March 4), we can

only conclude that you are referr-
ing to the amount of money spent.
We would characterize the effect
created by these decorations as
disappointing. How so much
money could be spent on corru-
gated paper, a stroboscopic hat!
light, a plastic chandelier, a few
flags and some sequined signs is
beyond us. Paris is a city rich in
culture and diversity. Surely more
imaginative decorating themese
could have been presented. Per-
haps if the Fancy Dress theme
were announced earlier, studen'
suggestions for decorations could
be collected in a drop box in the
Co-op.

Our most important objection
concerning Friday night deals
with the SAB itself. We strongly
disagree with the practice of the
SAB feting itself at student ex-
penses. We suppose the argument
for the “lavish” buffet and bar
they give themselves is that they
work hard. Big deal. They took the
job voluntarily, and they knew all
of the work it would involve.
We're sure people could be found
to do a responsible job without
their requiring that an “appropria-
tion” of student funds for person-
al amusement be necessary for
them to accept a post on the SAB

Their thinking here is reminis
cent of the excesses of public ser-
vants in the real world outside the
colonnade. It's lamentable that at
a supposedly honorable institu-
tion this materialistic. pompous
greed should manifest itself in se
petty a fashion. The SAB is sup
posed to be serving the student
body, not vice versa.

We are proud that so many
people from all over the country
wish to attend our school's big
weekend. It can certainly be tak
en as a compliment to the efforts
of the SAB and the school low
ever, every institution can stand
improvement, and Faney Dress is
no exception. The SAB should
keep in mind that Faney Dress is
primarily for the students of
WAL, not the entire East Coast of
the United States

The Ring-tum PhiSurvey

This week’s survey returns us to
the innermost private world of the
Mary Baldwin student, examining
in particular her attitudes toward
sex, birth control, and drugs and
alcohol.

by GREG K. HALEY

Looking at the drinking habits
of Mary Baldwin students, we
found that less than 1 per cent
never drink alcoholic beverages,
34 per cent drink only seldom or
about twice-a-month, and 66 per
cent drink at least two or three
times a week. Twenty-seven per
cent said they drink “often,” at
least four days a week.

As for these drinkers getting
drunk, 38 per cent said definitely
never. Another 38 per cent oblig-
ed the idea that they occasionally
get drunk. Finally, a full 24 per
cent answered that they get in an
uncontrollable condition quite of-
ten when drinking.

The list of aleoholic beverages
selected for consumption is un-
limited. Bourbon was the most
mentioned beverage, followed
rather closely by rum, gin, vodka,
and beer. Almost all possibilities
were mentioned at least once or
twice, ranging from imported
scotches to banana daiquiris.

When asked, “Have you ever
smoked marijauna?”, 63 per cent
responded affirmatively. But
when asked, “Do you smoke regu-
larly, now?”, only 10 per cent an-
swered affirmatively. Of these
steady marijauna smokers, only
15 per cent answered that they did
so often,

A generally different area is the
actual purchasing of marijauna.
Even for the smokers, less than
25 per cent admitted having ever
made a purchase and less than 1
per cent admitted frequent pur-
chases. The rest mooched or only
participated when it was supplied
or offered. One subject that did
admit buying once, replied that it
was not for herself, but “for my
mother.”

In dealing with legalities, I ask-
ed, “Do you feel that National
Laws concerning marijauna are
fair?” A full 33 per cent felt that
they were actually fair enough.
Another 6 per cent felt that they
should be even stricter. Obviously,
the remainder believed the pre-
sent laws to be unfair and were
often very explicit about possible
changes—such as, telling the gov-
ernment to go ye forth and mul-
tiply, in net so many words.

Getting into the “heavier stuff,”
I asked the subjects, “Have you
ever tried any non-medical
drugs?” Only about 27 per cent
had, but this use was very limited.
often to only one or two experi-
ences. Of these, a full 100 per cent
had tried “speed” for studying or
dieting. Bevond this, there were
limited experiences of LSD and
cocaine, by less than 1 per cent of
the subjects.

Considering one final idea with
respect to these different drugs

(including marijauna) I asked, ‘Do
you object to others smoking pot
or taking drugs?” 60 per cent ad-
mitted to objecting to others
smoking pot around them now
with 98 per cent objecting to drug
experiences around them. So, the
drug scene is probably on the outs
for now, no matter what brand
you prefer.

Lastly, I want to get into sex
and birth control ... who doesn’t?
I asked the subjects, is sex. part of
your plans for “a perfect week-
end”. Only 20 per cent answered a
definite yes. 23 per cent answered
possibly. 10 per cent answered not
necesarily. A full 47 per cent an-

swered a definite “no.”

Going on, even with this minor
setback, | asked who they feel is
actually responsible for birth con-
trol. 53 per cent felt that both par-
ties are responsible, since both are
involved (usually). 40 per cent
felt that the woman is and 7 per
cent felt the man is.

Within this responsibility, less
than 30 per cent actually use or
have available for use any birth
control method, 27 per cent are
on the pill and les than 3 per cent
have an IUD. So, they seem to say
one thing, but practice another—
or don’t practice.

Dealing with a rather recent

controversial issue, I asked, “Do
you agree with abortions by con-
senting adults?” A full 97 per cent
replied “yes.” Of those, only 7 per
cent would ever consider having
an abortion, anly only 10 per cent
had ever actually had one.

As a final note, I definitely do
not want the ladies from Mary
Baldwin College to think that the
Ring-tum Phi Servey is and will
be restricted to their attitudes,
ideas, and experiences. Next week,
the R-tP Poll will move down the
road for a close look at the love-
lies from another of the “suitcase”
colleges—Sweet Briar. So, stay
tuned!

Operation Gator Swamp I:
Adventures of a combat photographer

By DOUGLASS DEWING
What am I doing here? ...

this sort of thing, Operation Gator
Swamp I, sponsored by W&L’s
Army ROTC unit. Gator Swamp I,
a field training exercise (FTX) the
source of al the gunfire heard last
Friday night and Saturday after-
noon just before the lacrosse
game.

Pitting members of various
classes against each other, Gator
Swamp I was an exercise more in
control of fighting units than tae-
ties, but tactics still played an im-
portant part.

My part was simple: I was out
there to take pictures for the
Army, which convinced me that
the cadets would all be firing

Friday afternoon I showed up
at the ROTC building and was is-

was a member of a three man
squad assigned to defend the blue
forces patrol base.

I was also issued an M-16 with
two full magazines of blank am-
munition and left for dinner.

Trot in ankle-deep mud. It was
done at something between march-
ing and double time, due to the
marvelous traction. By the time
we reached the patrol base, the
mud was climbing up to my knees.
The cadence for the last part of
our trot was similar to slop, slide,
slop, squish.

1830: we had reached the pat-
rol base, sent out our attack pat-
rols, listening posts, outposts and
set up our guards. I was in the
guard detachment, one of three.
It was too dark to take pictures,
despite the full moon.

My duty was to watch for the
signal from the LP-OP which
would indicate that enemy troops
were approaching the patrol base.
The atmosphere was tense; just
waiting for something to happen
must be the most nerve-racking
part of combat.

This was accentuated, every ten
minutes or so, by the sound of
firefights in the distance bring-
ing home the perilous conditions
we were in.

2009: a firefight erupted near
our command post, probably no
more than two to three hundred
meiers from our position. The
LP-OP sent the signal after the
firefight that enemy troops were
approaching. Follownig the signal,
they melted into the woods and
retreated to the patrol base.

I prepared for a defense. If |
have to go, I thought, those red
force fiends will have to work to
take me.

The mud was not so bad, but
the ground was cold and damp. I
could feel it soaking into my
knees and chest. | was in a pretty
good position, in fair cover with a
god field of fire on the approaches
to the patrol base, so I decided not
to try to move.

After twenty minutes, I saw a
single figure approaching the base
along the trail. Here they come, I
thought, and passed the word that
there was an intruder coming
down the trail. .

At about ten meters, I took a
bead on him, saying to myself, this
sure is a dumb way to attack a
base. Since there was no pass-
word, only a recognition signal,
I felt 1 had the intruder dead to
rights, when he came over to my
position. So much for my cover
and my camoflage job.

“Where’s Mattesky?” he asked.
“I'm from Walker's platoon and
our radio went out.” There went
the vision of a glorious defense.

After he headed back out, I re-
settled myself in the weeds. Spor-
adic firing occupied my mind.

Then a more urgent matter oc-

eupied my mind, My boxer shorts -

were beginning to climb into my
crotch. I began to fidget.

2115: the LP-OP went back out
to their listening posts.

2130: I had given up on the red
forces, it was obvious they were

never going to find us.

I sat up, loosened my shorts,
leaned back on the field pack, af-
fectionately known as a butt pack,
and began to wonder when, if
ever, we might see some action.

My musings were all for naught,
because at 2200 the CO put us on
admin, the FTX word for truce or
peacetime, and called the troops
in for an evaluation. A senior eva-
luator and I walked back to the
ROTC building swapping hits off
a flask brought out into the wilds
for “medicinal purposes.”

Saturday morning proved to be
an entirely different sort of opera-
tion. After getting up and having
a delicious breakfast of C-rations
brought along especially for the
occasion, I returned to the ROTC
building. While everyone was put-
ting on their makeup I decided
that since it was such a beautiful
day, I would concentrate on shoot-
ing off the film. As a rifle would
only slow me down, I left it at the
ROTC building.

But I did don the camouflage,
a light spring camo job made up
mostly of light green and black,
with accents of olive. I looked
great!

That was before I heard the
rumor that in the midst of all that
blank ammo, somebody had
thought they heard a live round
go off the night before.

We only live once, so I checked
my light settings and prayed the
rumors were wrong.

The Turkey Trot had dried out
a little during the night and the
run was a lot easier. We were on
the run by 0800,

0905; off the Turkey Trot recon-
noitering the defense site for later
that afternoon. After a brief re-
eon, off went the blue forces for
their attack at double-time.

One of the cadre, who had serv-
ed in Vietnam and Cambodia com-
mented you don’t run on the at-
tack, but on the withdrawal. He
remembered advising Cambodian
troops and said “on the attack, I
— During withdrawals, I

{| led the way briefly so I could
get a picture. By 1955 we were in
enemy territory, We passed the
Maury Service Authority Building
and disappeared into the woods.

We had reached attack point
Charlie and were moving toward
phase line Beer, which we reached
at about 1030.

At this point, outlying members
of the patrol decided we had pick-
ed up some shadows, and the pat-
rol began moving a little more
cireumspectly. That means go
around hills instead of over them
at the half-way-up the hill point.
More footslogging.

sault across Whistle Creek and up
the hill toward the enemy. I was

The Generals’ most successful
season ever ended last Friday
night on a negative note as they
lost to the Glassboro State ‘Profs’,
103-87, in the NCAA regional tour-
nament consolation game. It was
the last game for seniors Bob
Flint, Chris Larson, Steve Hand,
Kim Sims and Don Berlin.

The night before, Washington
and Lee, ranked second in the na-
tion in the Division and seeded
first in the tournament, ended
their dreams of an NCAA cham-
pionship by losing to fourth-seed-

 

ed Wiliam Paterson, 92-68, in the
first round of the regional tourna-
ment.

The only bright spot of the
whole tournament for W&L came
after the championship game,
when Dave Leunig was named to
the Tournament team.

In the championship game, Wil-
liam Paterson came back from an
eight-point halftime deficit to de-
feat North Carolina Methodist, 60-
58, thus advancing to the Division
ill Eastern regionals in Philadel-
phia this week.

Stickmen whip Duke, 18-5

by BILL FLESHER

Call them what you will—young-
sters, newcomers, even the “Kid-
die Corps” if you must.

But if their performance against
Duke Saturday is any indication,
don’t ever refer to the 17 players
in their first season of Washing-
ton and Lee’s varsity lacrosse
team as lacking in the basic skills
of the game.

For it was a group of new
names-—Mike Schuler, Jay Foster,
and Bob Clements to mention a
few—which swiped the spotlight
from the veterans as W&L open-
ed its drive for a sixth consecu-
tive appearance in the NCAA post-
season tournament by trouncing
the outclassed Blue Devils, 18-5.

Once the “old hands” had put in
a good workout the first-year
players took over and demonstrat-
ed their wares to an unusually
passive gathering of 2100 at Wil-
son Field.

“T had a really good time,” said
Schuler, the freshman attackman
whose three goals gave him game
scoring honors along with mid-
fielder Jack Dudley.

It would have been hard for any
of the Generals to have been dis-
appointed by the afternoon's
course of events. Once sophomore
attackman Chris Kearney scored
the first goal of the season just
1:13 into the game, W&L was in
command despite Duke’s efforts
to control the game’s tempo by
employing a modified stall on of-
fense.

”

W&L went on to score four
more times before Duke’s Joe Dev-
lin beat goalie Charlie Brown
from five yards out to put the
Blue Devils on the board midway
through the second period.

But the Generals laid any re-
maining doubts as to the game’s
outcome by scoring five goals in
succession to go ahead, 10-1, early
in the third stanza.

Then it was time for the new
faces. An all-freshman attack of
Schuler, Foster, and Rob Eisdor-
fer combined for five goals and
four assists in the final two quar-
ters. Clements, who took over the
netminding ‘duties from Brown at
halftime turned in a 12-save per-
formance.

Even freshman defenseman
Steve Johnson got into the scoring
act, beating the high-scoring Tom
Keigler to the 1977 scorebook by
setting up classmate Art DeCarlo
for a fourth-quarter goal.

“It was great to see that every-
body contributed,’ W&L coach
Jack Emmer said afterward. “We
leraned that we shouldn’t be
afraid to play any of our kids in
any situation that may come up
throughout the season.”

Foster called his first college
game “a real challenge, but a
whole lot of fun.”

“Coach Emmer told us at the
beginning that it would be a lot
of hard work but that we should
never worry about not playing,

that we’d all get our time,” Foster”

added. “I love to play, but it’s

Baseball Generals
covering all hases

With twelve returning letter-
men from last year’s team, which
posted a respectable 9-13 won-
lost record while facing a tough
schedule with only two healthy
pitchers, the baseball Generals
appear to be ready to make 1977
the year they put it all together.

With an enthusiasm which
Coach Joe Lyles says is unprece-
dented, the Generals are ready to
take on the demands of the chal-
lenging schedule before them.
Teams like Lynchburg, Liberty
Baptist, William and Mary, and
Randolph-Macon are no pushovers
by any means, and Coach Lyles
knows this. “Our schedule this
year is as tough a one as we could
play. Almost every one of our
games in the ODAC is away, and
that could cause us some trouble
unless we play the way we can.
which means winning baseball. To
win you need the essentials of
tight defense, good, consistent
pitching, and clutch hitting. I
think we've got the material to do
all the above and more very well.”

Lyles, never one to overstate
his feelings about a ball club,
could easily be right this year
about his team’s chances. The
major area where the Generals
got in trouble last year was the
pitching department, where only
senior co-captain Dan Westbrook
and senior Bill .Gregg provided
stability. This year, after Lyles’
extensive recruiting efforts, pro-
mises to be one in which the Gen-
erals may have trouble deciding
who to pitch with all the talent
they have. Freshman Chip Childs,
Vic Shepherd, Tracey Hodge, and
Bay Steele, along with returning
lettermen Mike Rhodes and Bruce
Williams, make up a formidable
pitching staff, Lyles notes, “These
young pitchers, although lacking
college experience, had outstand
ing records in high school and the
depth they give us will be a defin
ite key in our numerous double
header appearances this spring.”

    

fe

  
 
 

If these youngsters, under the gui-
dance of the veterans, can show
the poise needed to be successful
collegiate pitchers, the Generals
could go a long way.

One way of building up the con-
fidence of the youngsters is to
drill them in the fundamentals, a
task at which Lyles is an acknowl-
edged leader, getting the pitchers
to think about every pitch, the
situation, and where to position
the infielders. The only weak spot
in this otherwise talent-laden pit-
ching corps is the lack of any left-
handed pitchers, a fact which en-
ables the opposing team to stack
its lineup with lefthanded hitters.

The infield this year is basically
the same as last year, the only ex-
ception being the noticable ab-
sence of Dave Otey, a four-year
letterman who was lost to gradua-
tion. Filling his position will be
Bob Szezecinski, an all-VCAA se-
lection at designated hitter last
season. “Choosy” has the bat to
keep him in the line-up, and his
quick hands and powerful aim
could make people forget Otey
very quickly.

At shortstop, Lyles had planned
on junior Ted Hissey starting, but
post-football season knee surgery
has cut down on Teddy’s ability to
work out at full tilt so far. Hissey,
a clutch hitter and fine glove man,
will be lost for only the first week
or so, but by then may have trou
ble unseating senior Mickey Clary,
whose consistent hitting and vast
ly improved fielding has impress
ed everyone

At second base the Generals are
blessed with senior co-captain Ben
Bonaventura, a polished infielder
who is the team leader both on
the field and off. Lyles says
“Ben's always thinking baseball!
whether it be in December or
June. His keen concentration and
enthusiasm motivates the rest of
the team to play its best, and

Ben's ability to tutor the young

great just to be a part of all of
this, to cheer the guys on from the
sideline.”

The “guys” Foster referred to
gave a good early season account
of themselves in the season open-
er. Kearney, Johnny Black, Doug
Fuge, and Jay Sindler each scored
twice, while attackman Jeff Fritz
added three assists. The only dis-
paraging note was the Generals’

poor faceoff performance. Four
W&L players managed to win just
11 of 28 faceoffs, a statistie which
must be improved with the rugged
schedule that lies ahead for W&L.

But as Emmer noted, “It was an
early-season game, and we know
that we have plenty of room to
improve.”

Even if the rookies did play like
it was mid-season.

NCAA performance

disappoints wrestlers

The wrestling team finished out
its season last week with a disap-
pointing finish in the NCAA
championships in Binghamton,
NY. W&L’s four representatives
returned to Lexington on Sunday
with only one win among them,
having been soundly defeated by
the stiff competition.

Boyd Breeding netted the only
win of the Generals as he defeated
an opponent from MIT by a 17-8
superior decision. Boyd Controlled
his opponent on his feet in order
to mount up the winning margin.
In his next match however, he
found that the tables had been
turned and he was in the unfami-
liar position of being dominated
on takedowns. This proved to be
the deciding factor as Boyd, left

without his main offensive wea-
pon, was soundly defeated.

Ray Gross turned out to be the
victim of a poor draw in the seed-
ings. As luck would have it, Ray
drew the first seeded wrestler and
was simply defeated by a superior
opponent. To make matters worse,
the Montelair grappler was de-
feated two rounds later which pre-
vented Ray from moving on to the
consolation rounds.

Ed Rodgers was defeated by a
Brockport wrestler on a close deci-
sion in the first round. Rodgers
put his opponent to his back and
was winning 7-4 going into the
third period. Brockport rallied
and came back to take the “Stork”
down twice in the third period to

ous attacks as Teddy Roosevelt’s
charge up San Juan Hill in Cuba
or Pork Chop Hill in Korea. At the
time, I was far too busy. Getting a
couple of shots of troops fording
Whistle Creek through green
smoke, I had to run like hell to
catch up to the front. But I was
slowed down, as I passed a squad
radio operator whose butt pack
had snagged on the barbed wire
fense.

After freeing him, I nearly got
caught on the thing myself, but
managed to get free and ran hell-
for-leather to the front of the col-
umn and past, half way up the hill
to the shelter of some rocks, got
down, turned around, raised the
camera just in time to hear Major
Wolf Kutter, the advisor for the
red forees say “Cease Fire.”

Damn!!! All that for nothing.

Following the critiques of both
sides (it all went pretty well all
considering, only one sprained an-
kle: all agreed the proper way to
take the hill was to use artillery
to blow the people out of their
holes) it was off to the defensive
site, many hills back in the other
direction.

Oh, my aching legs. I was get-
ting to hate the sight of ground
which went uphill.

1230: back at the defensive site.
\fter everybody was in position,
everybody had lunch. More C-ra
tions. Really, they’re pretty good,
especially with a little tabasco
sauce and especially when you are
hungry. There was no real rush,
because the enemy wasn’t suppos-
ed to cross into the attack phase

1245: we went tactical (just as

admin means peace, tactical
means non-peace).
1315: we saw the red forces

crossing the hills in front of our
position across the crest.

Now I have to admit that we
knew they were coming, and they
knew we knew they were coming,
but still, that is dumb.

Shortly, they were at the base
of our hill. Epithets began passing
back and forth between defenders
and attackers. Most have escaped
my mind, which is just as well,
beeause the editor would never
let me print them. They involved
the immediate and distant ances-
try of the attackers, their dietary
habits, and some cast aspersions
upon not only their courage, but
their manhood. (That was really
unfair, because one of the depart-
ment’s exchange students from
Sem was on the red side)

At this point I moved out about
25 meters downhill from the de-
fensive perimeter and prepared to
shoot off a whole roll of film.

The red forees popped red
smoke, appropriate I thought, and
began to move uphill. I was ready
to take pictures as the heroic (but
futile, after all one does pick sides
in these things despite a journa-
list’s objectivity) attackers came
through the smoke.

Just as they started to come
through the smoke, some brave
soul picked up the smoke gernade
and heved it another ten meters
up the hill.

I turned tail, moved ten meters
up the slope and got ready to take
that picture again.

Then it was all over, all that
frenetic action just came to an
end

tie the score at the buzzer. Rod-
gers lost a point on riding time,
however to lose the match 11-10.

The biggest disappointment of
the weekend came as captain Jim
Crytzer lost to a St. Lawrence
wrestler to finish out his W&L
career. Jim’s record of 65-31-5 is
the best career record in W&L’s
history. This season was probably
the best of Crytzer’s four years at
W&L as he compiled a 25-6 sea-
son record, led the team in team
points, placed first in two tourna-
ments, second in two others, plac-
ed fourth in the state, was named
most valuable wrestler in two
tournaments, and was ODAC
champ. In addition, Jim served as
team captain and was instrumen-
tal in molding the young W&L

squad into a formidable team
which compiled a 10-3 record
against tough competition.

Despite the disappointment of
the nationals, the Generals have
no reason to be dissatisfied with
the entire séason. Despite the loss
of the team’s two seniors, Jim
Crytzer and Bill Cole, the team
should return next year stronger
than ever before. This year’s crop
of freshmen has gained valuable
varsity experience. In addition,
next year should find quite a few
experienced Juniors and Seniors
getting the starting nod, which is
a situation that we have not seen
here in the last few years. In
short, Coach Franke can spend the
off-season with a smile on his face,
knowing that the good times have
just begun.

Track team takes second

by JERRY HARRIS

The writing was on the wall.
After a season that saw the Gen-
erals indoor track team hampered
by injuries, it was only natural
that the same nemesis would ap-
pear in the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference championship meet.
Due to the pivotal injury of co-
captain John Tucker, W&L fell
short of Lynchburg to finish see-
ond in the ODAC.

Midway through the meet on
Saturday, W&L was in literal
deadlock with Lynchburg and
Bridgewater for first place. It was
then, during the 440 yard relay,
that Tucker pulled his hamstring.
\s a result, W&L placed second
in that relay event which they
should have won. The loss of Tue-
ker also hurt the Generals in the
60 yard dash and the mile relay.
Coach Norris Aldridge noted “that
(the injury) really cost us the
meet.”

Despite the disappointing sec-
ond place finish, the Generals still
performed better than they ever
have in the indoor championships
W&L had three individuals win
their events while several more
placed to account for the team’s

73 points. Lynchburg won with 78
points while Bridgewater and Roa-
noke scored 68 and 10 points re-

Phil Dunlay continued his strong
efforts in the weight events by
winning the 35 pound weight
throw and placing second in the
shot. Norvell Scott, shackled by a
knee injury all year, won the long
jump with his best jump ever in
indoor competition. Mike Burns
warmed up for the outdoor sea-
son by winning the two mile run
with a time of 9:48:7.

Following is a breakdown of

Mike's defensive ability makes

Backing him up will be either Guy

Clary, whom Lyles feels is cap

positions. Handling the so-called
‘tools of ignorance” behind the

ball as well as throw out op

will be Maynard's back-up

Looking at the outfield, Lyles

face. While having lost Mike Fal
cone from what Lyles has termed
“the best outfield I've ever coach
ed,” sophomores Rick Wiles and
David Hundley return to give the
Generals the needed hitting punch
and defense. Wiles (313) and
Hundly €301) not only are ex
tremely clutch players both be
hind the plate and in the field
but also provide the Generals with
excellent speed and savvy on the
basepaths. Both of these men
should gain some sort of post-sea
son recognition this year. Filling
in at right field could be Lyles’
hardest task, since no fewer than
four fine outfielders are vying for
that position. Sophomore Chuck
D'Auria seems to have the inside
track on the job, but freshmen
Don Swadert and Pete Restaino
both excellent hitters. and senior:
Bob Carpentier, are pressing D’
Auria hard and could make the
choosing of a starter in right field
a tough but pleasant chore for the
coach

Water polo gains
varsity sport status

Washington and Lee is now a
member of the Division I section
of the Middle Atlantic Water Polo
League and according to Coach
Sterans “should compete favor-
ably with the Ivies and other Lea
gue members.” In his successful
appeal for water polo’s varsity
status, Sterans noted that “Var-
sity water polo will cost the Uni
versity relatively little, while pro-
viding approximately twenty stu-
dents with the opportunity § to
compete.” In other words, we al-
ready own a pool and there’s
abundant student interest.

Having competed as a club for
the past six years, water polo as a
varsity sport was obviously not a
“spur-of-the-moment”  considera-
tion freshly out of the starting
blocks. Last year this club team
finished their season 6-1 in dual
meets and second in the Virginia
State Tournament. Although all-
stater Ted Van Leer and last
year’s high-scoring Bill Gregg will
be graduating, the rest of the
squad is young and returning.

In fact, a junior varsity program
is also scheduled which, along
with the Varsity program, will
compete with schools such as Co-
lumbia University, Villanova, Sy-
racuse, Penn State, the University
of Pennsylvania, and arch rival
Johns Hopkins University. It is
also rumored that these schools
will sport co-ed teams.

But how does water polo fit into
the W&L sports program? Most
appropriately, as water polo of-
fers at least a taste of every sport
now being played at W&L. Though
the rules are applied somewhat
differently, water polo features
both the dribbling and passing of
a basketball game, and requires
the endurance of a long distance
runner. The game also necessit-
ates the hand-eye coordination of
a baseball pitcher, while the ob-

Congressional interns

sought by Rep. Butler

Four interns will be selected to
work during two separate one-
month sessions in Congressman M.
Caldwell Butler’s Washington of
fice. College students who are
residents of the Sixth Congres
sional District of Virginia are
eligible to apply.

Applications are available in
Butler’s Washington office located
in Room 409 Cannon House Office
Building, Washington, D. C. 20515
and all District Offices.

The two-one month sessions will
begin June 13 and July 11 respec-
tively. Each intern will be paid a
salary established by the U. S.
House of Representatives of at
least $500, and each will be re
sponsible for all expenses.

In the past many interns have
found inexpensive temporary
housing at George Washington
University, according to Butler.

The deadline for filing applica
tions to participate in the Summer
Intern program is March 11.

promising. With the perfect blend
of youngsters and veterans, this
team could produce a solid winner
for this year and years to come

“The talent is there,” says Lyles
“All they have to do is just relax
and play the baseball they're cap
able of playing, and we'll be right
in the thick of the ODAC race,
maybe even the NCAA's. But I'm
not going to make any long-range
predictions now; I'm just going to
play each game one at a time, and
go from there. We're young, but
our enthusiasm and veterans
should make up for any problems
of inexperience we may encounter
during the season.”

ject he throws resembles a soccer
ball. Like football, a player may
be tackled when in possession of
the ball, and as in lacrosse a “face-
off” takes place when rightful pos-
session is undecided.

When the ball is at the “other”
end of the pool, however, it is per-
haps wrestling which predomi-
nates play. Ordinary fouls such as
“it is illegal to dunk under his (or
her) oponent while swimming
even or behind” suggest that such
activity actually oceurs during a
normal game.

The returning goalie from last
year’s team commented that “a
lot of people are afraid to come
out,” and further added that “this
will be water polo’s first year as 4
varsity sport, and we hope to get
a lot of recruits from P. E.
classes.” It just doesn’t make
sense to struggle in one of Coach
Lord’s burn-out P. E. classes, when
you can earn a varsity letter,
while “swimming” among females
in skimpy bathing suits.
