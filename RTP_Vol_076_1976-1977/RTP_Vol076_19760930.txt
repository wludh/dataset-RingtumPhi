E.C. budget finalized

By FRITZ GOLDBERG

The Executive Committee of
the Student Body completed its
annual ritual of Autumn Tuesday
night by taking a first vote on
the amount of dollars to be al-
lotted to the various student com-
mittees and activities on campus.

The budget process will not be
formally complete until a two-
thirds vote of the E.C. comes
down-—a week after the first vote,
at least, according to the consti-
tution—but the figures agreed to
this week settle everything except
the sticky business of publications
salaries, a topic that promises to
bring about a great deal of strong
words and gnashing of teeth at
the committee’s regular meeting
Monday night, Oct. 4, at 7 o’clock.

The subject of salaries came up
Tuesday night when the E.C. ap-
propriated $700 for the Ariel

budget. The allotment carried an
amendment saying that none of
the money could go toward a
salary for the literary magazine’s
editor, Mark Richard. Richard had
requested $800 from the E.C.

The E.C, also voted to spend $19
to pay for a keg of beer con-
sumed at an Ariel reading session
last year, but not paid for by
last year’s staff.

The sixty-year-old tradition of
paying salaries to editors came up
again when the Ring-tum Phi and
Calyx budgets were discussed.
The newspaper received $3920
and the yearbook got $8400. The
two budgets were cut $200 and
$350, respectively, until the E.C.
decides whether the editors and
business managers of the publica-
tions will receive renumeration
for their efforts.

The persons who argue against

Faculty committee
members chosen

By Wander J. Lorentz daHaas

The Executive Committee held
its second regular weekly meeting
Monday night at 7 p.m.

At the outset of the session,
Dean John, amidst constrained
smiles, swore in the respective
student elected members in at-
tendance for the 76-77 school
year. This group consisted of the
EC representatives, LF.C. chair-
man and chairmen from a handful
of other committees.

Then as quickly as he had ar-
rived, President Tom Hunter ex-
cused himself and Vice-president
Sandy Stradtman took over. He
announced that selections for the
Who’s Who committee will be
made on Monday, October 4, after
the EC meeting that evening.
Next, Neil Pentifallo, who is head-
ing up an ad-hoc committee con-
cerning possible changes in the
academic schedule, requested that
any comments in relation to this
matter be brought to his attention
by the student body.

Finally, Sandy Stradtman re-
ported that the applications for
membership to several openings
on committees were insufficient in
number to be reviewed at this
time. Henee the application date
for the following committees was
extended to 7 p.m. October 4:
Athletics, Library, and Health.

With this action, the E.C.’s final
business at hand was completed
and they shifted their attention
to processing the applications for
the Admissions, Courses and De-
arees, Lectures, Financial Aid
and Faculty Executive Commit-
Lees.

The following persons were ap-
pointed to those committees: Ted
de Saussure, Courses and De-
grees; Kirk Ruffin, Faculty E.C.;
Barry Godin and Jim Falk, Ad-
missions; Rob Sult and Peter
Goss, Financial Aid, and Sam

Rogers, lectures

ADDENDUM
By JOE FITZGERALD

Monday night’s interviews of
applicants for faculty committee
positions were open to the press
and public. This is not to say that
any revealing reports on the grill-
ing of the prospective committee
members are forthcoming. In fact,
at least two of the journalists in
attendance left before the E.C.
had finished with the first com-
mittee.

The fact that makes the open
meetings worthwhile is that they
were not open last year in spite
of a clause in the student body
constitution which clearly states
that the meetings can only be
closed for the discussion of pos-
sible honor violations. The E.C.
closed the meetings in the past
saying that the people being in-
terviewed would be more open
and more frank in close session.
This argument was used even
though the student body voted to
open the meetings three years ago
while this very argument was
being displayed on the front page
of the Ring-tum Phi.

The meetings are open now
because a determined senior
representative, Walt Kelley, with
the help of sophomore Neil Penti-
fallo, launched a presuasive cam-
paign before the meeting Monday
night te convince the other mem-
bers that the student body con-
stitution was written to tell the
E.C. how to act, not to fill space
in the student handbook.

We do not know exactly what
Kelley did to bring about this
startling change in the executive
attitude. We do know that when
E.C. Secretary Radar Davis was
asked about the new policy Tues-
day he asked innocently, “Haven't

paying salaries to the heads of
the publications—these persons
are known as fiscal conservaties—-
argue that the leaders of other
student committees and organiza-
tions do not get paid for their
work.

The persons in favor of the
salaries—these persons are known
as editors—argue that the other
chairmen do not have to meet
regular publication deadlines or
put out a weekly newspaper. They
also argue that the salaries, which
are proportionate to the profit the
publication makes, encourage the
editors to do a better job.

The Student Bar Association re-
ceived a $7013 allocation. The
amount is two-thirds of the money
paid in student activity fees by
law students. The other third will,
in theory, go towards paying for
the law students’ attendance at
Contact and SAB functions.

The Curriculum Committee re-

: ceived all of its $310 request.

The Student Activities Board
received $32,260, about a thous-
and dollars less than its request.
The budget was cut presumably
on the theory that everyone pads
the budget request anyway and
the smaller amount will make the
SAB co-chairmen, Mike Arm-
strong and John Berley, work a
little harder.

E.C. Vice-President Sandy
Stradtman suggested an additional
$500 cut to keep the co-chair-
men jumping but the idea was
not carried out.

The “Big Bang” theory of We&L

By J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER
On the morning of Wednesday,
Sept. 22, around 11:15 a.m., James
Mallory of Woods Creek East had
just finished eating a lat.’ morn-
ing brunch. He was thinking about
the dirty dishes he had to wash
when he heard the sound of an
explosion from the new library
site. As soon as he went to the
glass door in his apartment to
investigate, a rock, about the size
of a man’s hand, came crashing
in three inches above his head
and another one two inches to
the right of his feet. Glass was
subsequently thrown all over him.
Col. Louis McFadden, Maj. Wolf
Kutter, and Sgt. Gordon Cameron
had been warned about the blast
and were standing in the back of

ITN reporter scheduled
for Lee Chapel lecture

Sandy Gall, a reporter and
newscaster for Independent Tele-
vision News (ITN) in London, will
speak in Lee Chapel on Tuesday,
Oct. 5 at 8:00 p.m.

Gall, who speaks fluent French
and German, was educated at
Trinity College in Scotland, and
at the Universities of Aberdeen,
Bonn and Mainz. As a reporter
for Reuters and ITN, Gall has
travelled all over the world. He
has reported on the Congo war,
the 1967 Middle East war, Viet-
nam, the Paris riots in 1968 and
the 1973 Middle East war.

In 1970 he began newscasting
for ITN in addition to reporting;
he still performs this dual role. In
1972, he covered the expulsion of
the Asian community from Ugan-
da. During this time he was
arrested by the Uganda army and
held for three days in the military
police barracks outside Kampala.
In 1973 he was in Jordan at the
time of the Yom Kippur war. Gall
was in Vietnam in 1975 when
Saigon fell to the North Viet-
namese; he remained for three
weeks, and left with film footage
that was later shown throughout
the world. Recently he has been
in Spain to cover the democratic
progress of the Carlos govern-
ment.

In addition to reporting and
newscasting, Gall has made doecu-
mentary films, including one on

King Hussein and one on the
Cresta Run
Gall will speak to several

classes. Among the topics he will
eover are the media in Britain,
Britain's future in the world (in
cluding colonial problems in Rho
desia) and his experiences as a
foreign correspondent

‘the ROTC lot.

the ROTC building when the blast
went off. Two seconds later, they
watched as a shower of rocks and
dirt damaged six cars parked in
The rocks also
battered the tin roof on the Build-
ing. Col. McFadden ran upstairs to
see if anyone was hurt. He found
no one hurt by the explosion, but
one of his secretaries had been
burnt with hot coffee. In the mad
scrample to get under the desks
for protection, Mrs. Kathleen
Dunlap knocked a pot of hot
coffee onto Mrs. Trois A. Moore.

Further investigation by Mc-
Fadden revealed that both win-
dows in his office had been blown
out and the ROTC building itself
had a four-inch dent in its side.

At the same time, Rodney
Cooke was on “the hill” worrying
about whether or not he would
have a ticket on his windshield
for parking illegally on the ROTC
road. When he returned to his car
later in the afternoon, he didn’t
have a ticket—-nor did he have a
windshield.

Jerry Maatman was in class
thinking about the preparations
he had yet to make before his
hometown honey arrived for the
weekend. Little did he knows that
because of a rock crashing in the
window next to his pillow, he
would have to cope with a cold
draft of air for that ensuing
weekend.

Bob Szezecinski, who rooms in
the same Woods Creek East apart
ment as Maatman, was there at
the time of the rock's entry
Szezecinski, who was obviously in-
volved in deep study, later told
Maatman that he believed some-
one had threwn the rock through
the window.

Prof. Griffith of the Economics
Dept. was teaching a class at the
time of the blast. The vibrations
from the blast rocked his lectern
and seattered his notes all over
the floor. It is reported that Prof
Griffith blamed the incident on
the SDS

All in all, the blast did quite a
bit of damage. Besides the dam
age to the apartments, ROTC
building. and the cars, an air
compressor used by Riddleburger
Co. was damaged to the extent of
$8000

What caused that blast to wreak
so much damage and throw “mini
ature boulders” 150-175 yards?
The other times dynamite was
used, nothing of that sort had
happened

An employee of Barger Con
struction said that the eharge
used was not stronger than any
previous one, The only difference

was in the lithology. It was not
solid rock, as had been true for
the other blastings, but rather
dirt, shale, and some solid rock.
Therefore, the dynamite used
under those conditions was too
strong.

Two rows of dynamite, one
above the other, were laid in holes
20 feet deep. The bottom row ex-
ploded a fraction of a second
before the top, knocking out the
top one’s foundation. When the
force of the top blast met the
force of the bottom blast, the
only place for the explosion to go
was out and up.

Orson Hostetter, a superinten-
dent for Barger. admitted that
the charge used was too strong.
He also confirmed reports that
the man who did the blasting had
been relieved of his job at the

ARA suit settled;

Darrel in charge

By JOHN HASTINGS

In 1959, Washington and Lee
University contracted ARA-Slater
Food Services to run the Evans
Dining Hall. Last January the
University decided that ARA’s
servies were no longer required
and terminated the contract.

The action seemed not to carry
any serious reprecussions until the
University violated one of the
terms of the contract and re-hired
Dining Service Manager Jerry
Darrell three months before the
six-month period was over. In
order to prevent W&Lfrom setting
a precedent for other schools in
the area to follow, ARA took W&L
to court.

The reason for the school’s
severing ties with ARA was that
as foed costs rose, the University
had to pay ARA to meet those
costs and enough for a_ profit.
Darrell had worked at W&L for
seven years, all with ARA, and
felt that he had the experience
and the personnel to succesfully
manage the dining hall.

Darrell’s reaction to W&L’s
withdrawal was, obviously, one of
elation. Not only was he now in
complete control of the facilities,
but he had more money to work
with. Darrell had actually been
hindered slightly by being in an
ARA franchise because he had to
buy through certain channels and

could not search for culinary
bargains.
The University Treasurer,

James W. Whitehead, re-iterated
Darrell’s feelings. When the
school was called to court in
September, Whitehead represent-
ed W&L. Rather than go through
with the court proceedings, the
two parties agreed to come to a
settlement out of court. The final
decision, which was agreeable to
all concerned, was that W&L
would retain Darrel at his present
position and that ARA would serve
in an advisory capacity for the
fall term. The actual cost to the
school could not be disclosed,

SENIORS’ MIXER

A mixer for seniors and only
seniors will be held on Oct. 5 in
conjunction with the senior
classes of Hollins, Sweet Briar,
Randolph-Macon, and Mary Bald-
win. For the sume of one dollar,
seniors and only seniors may
drink at will (liquor, yes, you
heard right, liquor) and dance to
the music of Fat Juke. The festivi
ties will begin at 8:30 p.m. in
Evans Dining Hall; tickets may
be purchased by seniors and only
seniors at the information desk
in the Student Center.

McClure estate leaves
$4 million to University

Washington and Lee University
has received a bequest valued at
approximately $4 million from the
estate of the late Mrs. Miriam
Caperton Alexander McClure of
New Orleans, La., who died last
Feb. 27.

Mrs. MeClure’s bequest is un
restricted and represents the bulk
of her estate. It will be applied
toward completion of the Uni
versity’s ongoing development
program for the decade of the
1970's. according to President
Robert E. R. Huntley, who an
nounced the gift

Mrs. MeClure was the daughter
of a W&L alumnus and the widow
of another

She was also a descendant of
the founder of Augusta Academy
the little school that eventually

grew into W&L. Robert Alex
ander, her ancestor, emigrated
from Ulster to America in 1737

and founded the Academy in 1749

Hier husband was Dr. Matthew
Thompson MeClure Jr. a 1904
W&L graduate who died in 1064
He was dean of the University ol
Illinois and professor of philoso

phy for 30 years, until his re
tirement in 1951, when he and
Mrs. McClure moved to New
Orleans, where her parents had
lived for many years

After graduation from Wé&l

he earned the M.A. degree at the
University of Virginia and the
Vvh.D. from Columbia. He taught

at Columbia and Tulane before go
ing to Illinois. In 1938, W&L
awarded him the honorary doctor
of laws degree.

Mrs. McClure’s father, the Res
William MeFaddin Alexander
studied at W&L from 1881 to 1884,
and was graduated from Unien
Theological Seminary in 1887, He
was a Presbyterian minister in
New Orleans for 40 years. In
1898, when he was 36 years old
W&L awarded him an honorary
doctor of divinity degree

In a letter to a W&L official
shortly after the death of her hus
band, Mrs. McClure wrote: “We
have always had a warm affection
for the University, It has alway
been of interest to me to know
that both my father and my hus

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

 

Thursday, September 30, 1976

Honor

All right, so editorials aren't just for editors, What follows
is an abridged version of a speech delivered by Student Body
Vice-President Sandy Stradtman at the freshman orientation
at. Natural Bridge. Mr. Stradtman addresses himself to the
principle of Honor.

* * * *

I trust that you know by now that we're here at Natural
Bridge to learn about the Honor Code; but, let me tell you,
you're missing the point entirely if you think that to do so
is merely to become familiar with a set of rules. Quite the
contrary. To learn about the Honor Code at Washnigton
and Lee is to be let in on a philosophy that runs much deeper
than any set of rules. It is to be let in on something that goes
far beyond tradition. Indeed, it is to learn about a belief that
presently binds and will continue to bind together W&L men
both on and off this campus for years to come; if, that is,
you confront this year with the belief that honor, above all
else, must characterize those of us here at W&L.

You see, we place a lot of emphasis on trust here. We don't
think it’s too much to ask for a man to do his own work,
represent himself truthfully, and claim only that.which is his.
\nd believe me you're going to have contact with guys here
for whom these three simple requests mean everything; guys
who are appalled by even the thought that they might not
be able to believe what their fellow classmates say, guys whose
stocachs turn at the thought of their friends cheating to get
ahead of them, guys who can casily muster up almost a hatred
for someone who steals from another,

These kinds of feelings, though, are not as extreme as
they might seem at first hearing, Because, remember, their
feelings are not based on something as inherently “cold” as
a set of written rules—no, not quite. Rules rarely engender in
a man that kind of intense emotion, But heartfelt beliefs do,
and it is that heartfelt belief, that conviction that to be honor-
able is to live as a man ought, that forms the impenetrable
base of the Honor System at Washington and Lee.

The Honor System is ours, It is not structured to work
avinst us. [t is not an ever-present guard over our every action,
\nd—it's not devised to put fear into the honest man, What
is true is that the Honor System exists to insure that we have
the kind of community that years and years of experience have
told us is the most desirable, that community which reinforces
the attitudes which are slipping away so rapidly elsewhere
today, Let me just pass on a word of caution which, similarly,
someone passed on to me; this is, that although the mechanics
of the system are important to learn, it is the principle, the
rationale, that we want you to come to grips with in the next
few davs. And let me suggest that we cannot maintain the
honorable community that we now have unless you all decide
right now to do your part during the coming year.

Undoubtedly, from time to time, you will hear comments
like “stealing a sign or a Bie pen is not that big a deal,” or
“vetting one answer off one guy's paper is certainly not going
to hurt anything,” or “aw, he won't care if 1 take just this
one beer.” Well, the fact is that here at W&L we do care,
and we care just as much about these type things as we de
about full-fledged copying, outright stealing, and blatant lv-
ing—beeause the overwhelming majority of people here on
this campus is smart enough to understand that honor is not
measured by degree; such is only a sad rationalization for
someone who lacks the conviction that it takes to be a man
of honor, Either we try to be honest or we don't, T just can't
see that there is any room fora guy who is honest most of the
time ina university which sends representatives all over the
country telling people that we have the most effective honor
vstem of any college we know,

We do have one of the best universities in this country
\nd vou can bet that we can attribute a lot of that success
to just what we're here to talk about during these two days-
We \nd I'm going to graduate in 1977

What do you do with

By BILL THOMSON
How about this one?
You are a senior who has ma-

jored in an area you “liked.” Now

you are thinking of looking for a

job/graduate school to keep you

busy after graduation. And there's
only one problem: you don’t have
the slightest idea of what you
want to do. An unfortunate situa-
tion, to say the least. A situation
that Mike Cappeto and Curtis

Hubbard are doing their best to

eliminate.

Cappeto, director of career coun-
seling and placement, and Hub-
bard, his assistant director, say
they hope that most of the advice
and assistance they give this year
will be centered on the under-
classmen.

It’s not that they dislike seniors.
They would, however, prefer to

reach the underclassmen early so
that students will not find them-
selves with a useless degree and
no plans at the end of their col-
lege careers.

Cappeto estimates that about
40 per cent of Washington and
Lee graduates go directly to some
form of graduate school while the
other 60 per cent enter the job
market. Cappeto and Hubbard
work together to assist seniors in
finding jobs or graduate schools
for which they are best suited.

“We realize fully that we can’t
bring in enough people to adequ-
ately employ all W&L seniors who
are looking for jobs,” said Cap-
peto, who is beginning his second
year at W&L. However, he is
“actively seeking” for representa-
tives from law schools, MBA pro-
grams, colleges and businesses to

an ---ology degree’?

this school year. As part of his
program to help establish stu-
dent career objectives and goals,
he recommends that juniors (and
even sophomores)s chedule inter-
views with representatives from
these organizations.

In addition to its usual efforts,
the Office of Career Counseling
and Placement is attempting to
enlist the aid of alumni who
would be willing to consider W&L
graduates for employment. So far,
Cappeto said, the alumni have
been far more active in the
recruitment of students than in
the placement of them after they
earn their degrees. He said,
though, that progress is being
made and that several alumni
have been discussing a placement
program for graduates.

Brass quintet leads program

of “serious

The Washington and Lee Uni-
versity Concert Guild opens its
1976-77 season tonight with the
Annapolis Brass Quintet.

The concert will take place at
8 p.m. in W&L’s Lee Chapel. This
is a return engagement for the
Quintet, which performed at
Washington and Lee three years
ago.

The program includes the first
public performance of “Quintet
No. 3” by Robert Stewart, profes-
sor of music at W&L. In addition,
the quintet will present the
American premiere of “Capriccio”
by Karl Pilss. Also on the pro-
gram are works by Claude Le-
Jeune, Giles Farnaby and Igor
Stravinsky.

The Annapolis Brass Quintet
was formed as a full-time en-
semble in 1971. Two of its cur-
rent members first organized the
group in 1967 when they were
midshipmen at the U.S. Naval
Academy, and for four years the
group was the academy’s official
brass ensemble.

The Quintet tours extensively
and this winter will perform in
the Midwest, the western United
States, and in Europe. It also has
three record albums to its cerdit.

Tonight’s is the first of eight
concerts the W&L Guild will spen-
sor this year. The next presenta-
tion, in mid-October, will be a
program of vocal music perfomed
by Miss Ann Tedards, a soprano
who specializes in Italian, French,
and English music of the six-
teenth and seventeenth centuries.

In November Canadian pianist
Robert Silverman will make his
second appearance on the Guild
Series, having performed here
four vears ago. Also scheduled for
November is a lecture recital on
oriental music by Tsai-Png Liang,
distinguished Chineses musicolog-
iest and performer from Taipei.
ilis appearance is co-sponsored by
the Asian Studies Program at
WA&L. Rounding out the fall pro-
gram is a concert to be given by
Frances Cole, harpsichordist.

TheStradvari Quartet leads off
the winter series with a conert
scheduled for January 19. This
string quartet needs little intro-
duction to Lexington audiences,

having performed here several
times in recent years. A compos-
ers’ workshop is planned for the
night preceding the concert;
music students are being encour-
aged to compose pieces for the
quartet to play during this session.

Two concerts in February will
close out the ’76-’77 seasons. Aline
van Barentzen (pianist), and Rolf
Bjorling (tenor), Miss Barentzen’s
performance here, one of several
stops on her American tour, will
include a piano concerto to be

performed in conjunction with

the Rockbridge Orchestra.

The Rockbridge Concert-
Theatre Series has also lined up
an impressive program for the
coming season. The Series, the
oldest community concert associa-
tion in the area, has been bring-
ing its audiences musical and
theatrical programs of high qual-
ity for 30 years.

Max Morath, ragtime pianist-
singer-comedian, will perform in
Lexington in November. His one-
man show blends humor, music,
history and satire into a bright
and affectionate look at a bygone
era. He has won critical acclaim
for his interpretation of America’s
musical past, and has performed
frequently on stage and television.

The Ciompi Quartet, quartet-in-
residence at Duke University, will
perform in Lee Chapel in Janu-
ary. Since in formation in 1965
the group has been delighting
regional concert goers with its

campus concerts

The Waverly Consort closes out
the RC-TS with a concert of Medi-
eval, Renaissance and Baroque
music. Composed of nine bril-
liant players and singers, the
group performs period music
ranging from  pastorales and
marigals to ribald drinking songs
and ballads of courtly love. The
Consort’s annual New York sub-
scription series at Lincoln Center
has sold out for two years in a
row.

Hubbard, a new member of the
WL administration, previously
woiked with the dean of men in
the housing office at Hampton
Institute. In addition to his in-
terest in minority affairs, he is
the faculty advisor to the Student
Association for Black Unity
(SABU) and an assistant dean of
students.

Cappeto (who adivses student
organizations and is in charge of
the University Federation and the
Early-Fielding Student Center)
said that he and Hubbard act as
a team and split duties “down
the middle.” With the objective
of establishing contacts on the
East coast “from Maine to
Florida,’ they have a number of
programs planned for this year.

Though some of the programs
are still in the planning stages,
others are definite. In addition to
the interviews by various schools
and businesses, there will be a
seminar on the techniques of in-
terviewing and another “Meet the
Professionals” program (which
Cappeto initiated last year). A
survey which will soon be sent
out to last year’s graduates will
provide information concerning
their post-college employment
and will hopefully act as a pre-
dictor for future classes. Results
of this survey should be available
soon after the beginning of the
next calendar year.

Cappeto and Hubbard are
enthusiastic about their proposed
projects and hope to expand exist-
ing programs.

“We can’t make decisions for
the students,” said Cappeto, “But
we are happy to give advice and
we know where to get additional
information.”

Recruitment committee
aids admissions office

By M. GRAY COLEMAN

Those W&L students who regu-
larly visit the Admissions offices
on the second floor of Washington
Hall may have recently noticed a
sharp decrease in the volume of
pedestrian traffic there. This
happy break for the nerves of
the assorted deans and secretaries
is basically due to the creation of
a new student committee for re-
cruitment. For this academic year
it is being chaired by Dave Me-
Lean and Steve Mangum, with
the assistance of assistant admis-
sions director Ken Ruscio.

The result of several months of
eareful planning by students and
administrators alike, the commit-
tee began work this month. Its
primary duties lie within the Ad-
missions Department—conducting
on-campus tours and regional col-
lege night programs for prospec.
tive students, Other responsibili-
ties are being added as time goes

on. These may include the handl-
ing of scholarship weekends,
visits by guidance counselors, and
so forth.

The philosophy behind the com-
mittee is that the present students |
are the best recruiters that W&L |
has. By seeing and speaking with
an active member of the student —
body, the potential freshman will —
hopefully gain a deeper insight
into what the “W&L Lifestyle” is
like. Also, the committee mem-
bers are chosen with an eye to
campus involvement and variety
of majors. In this way, visitors
an be assured of an informal tour-
guide, and can speak to a stu:
dent with academic interests
similar to their own.

“There is a lot of room for
creativity in this committee,” said
Mr. Ruscio. “In essence, this is
another chance for us to show
off our student body, which is a

Soccer team loses opener

their regular season with a 3-0
conference loss to Eastern Men-
nonite in Harrisonburg last Thurs-
day. As the score indicates the
team suffered from a lack of
offensive power, and finished with
only two shots on goal.

Goalies Reid Taylor and Mark
Bennett both played a half with
each recording five saves. Bennett
gave up the first EMC goal, with
Taylor in the net for the final
two, one coming on an indirect
kick.

The Generals were at home
yesterday against Radford, and
travel to North Carolina to play
Guilford and UNC-Greensboro
this weekend. The kickers have
an important home game on Oct.
6th when they host the University
of Virginia on Wilson Field. Game
time is 3:00 p.m.

The J.V. soccer Generals de-
feated Dabney Lancaster Com-

munity College last Saturday, 4-0.

The W&L booters have three
backs as the 1976 tri-captains,
and that area is regarded as the
team’s strongest. Senior Jeff Barr
is playing his fourth varsity sea-
son, and is a very steady and
consistent defender. Junior Mark
Derbyshire, the team workhorse,
is called by Piranian ‘an out-
standing leader,” and will give the
Generals a 100% effort at all
times, The third captain is senior
Mike Monahan, a hard tackler,
and versatile performer, who may
also see time on the line.

The goalkeeper situation is a
solid one, with junior Mark Ben-
nett, a 1975 V.LS.A. All-Star game
selection,, and freshman Neal
Crider fighting it out. Bennett is
regarded as a good clearer, while
Crider is an outstanding leaper.

Generals lose two,

face R-M Saturday

The football Generals return
home this Saturday, October 2nd,
looking for their first victory of
1976. W&L plays host to the
Randolph-Macon Yellow Jackets
in an Old Dominion Athletie Con-
ference game beginning at 1:30
p.m. on Wilson Field. Both W&L
and R-M are 0-2 on the year, the
Generals coming off a 20-0 de-
feat at the hands of Centre Col-
lege, while R-M was drubbed 49-15
by Towson State last weekend.

Last Saturday was a frustrat-
ing one in Danville, Ky., and it
was evident from the opening
kickoff that it wasn’t to be W&L’s
day. Washington and Lee trailed
9-0 at halftime on the strength of
a Safety, and a 66 yard run by
Centre halfback Jim Shannon. It
was the second straight week that
W&L was victimized by a long
scoring play.

Having to play catch up foot-
ball, W&L quarterback Ted Hissey
was forced to go to the air, and
finished the game with eight com-
pletions in 26 attempts. Facing a
strong Centre pass rush, he was
often forced to throw early, and
was the victim of dropped passes
in key situations. Centre had 330
yards in total offense to the Gen-
erals’ 180 yards, and gained 13
first downs to W&L’s ten. The
Colonels’ running attack carried
them in this game, as they ran 57

times for 267 yards. W&L was
only able to gain 105 rushing
yards, with halfback Raynard
Scott the leading rusher with 37
yards,

The key to the game was in
turnovers. Centre had only one, a
32 yard interception by strong
safety Bryan Sibson, while the
Generals were intercepted three
times, and fumbled the ball away
an additional three times. W&L’s
usually potent passing attack was
unable to get untracked and fin-
ished with only 75 yards. Flanker
Richard Wiles caught three passes
for 31 yards.

The Generals defensive player
of the week was senior Jack
Reeves, a 6-0, 205 Ib. tackle from
Lexington. He was credited with
three solo tackles and six assists
in the Centre game. Junior
Raynard Scott, a 5-10, 180 Ib. half-
back from Frederick, Md., was
named the team’s offensive player
of the week for his performance
last weekend.

The Randolph-Macon game on
Saturday is the Generals’ second
conference game of 1976, the team
having lost their season opener
to Emory and Henry, 24-17 The
game is the first O.D.A.C. tilt for
the Yellow Jackets, who have
won four of the last five meet-
ings between the teams, including
a 26-14 decision in 1975.

should lead the ’76 scoring attack.
Collier, whose father owns the
Cleveland Cobras of the American
Soccer League, is small, but has
the confidence of Piranian when
it comes to putting the ball in
the goal. Tyson makes a good
target man because of his height,
and was the General’s leading
scorer last season. Much of the
kickers’ scoring punch will come
from these two players.

Sophmore Ed Grandes del Mazo,
and Woods King will point the tri-
captains as the teams’ leading
backs. Grandes del Mazo reads the
field well, and if fully recovered
from his back problems, should
have an outstanding year. King
keeps cool under pressure, and
should be the Generals’ starting
center halfback.

Coach Piranian talks enthusi-
astically about the ’76 season, and
sets as the teams’ immediate goal
that of a winning season. Realis-
tically he believes his charges
have the ability to challenge for
both the O.D.A.C. and the V.LS.A.
championships.

The complete 1976 schedule
follows: Sept. 23, at Eastern
Mennonite, Sept. 29, Radford
(home), Oct. 1, at Guilford, Oct. 2,

Harriers split meet,

record first victory

The cross country Generals be-
came the first W&L varsity
athletic team of 1976-77 to gain a

-vietory, as they split their tri-

meet with Oavis & Elkins and
Shepherd College last Saturday.
The harriers defeated Shepherd
16-39, but lost to Davis & Elkins
by a 16-43 score. Low score wins
in cross country, with 15-50 being
a perfect score.

Junior Allen Weeks was the
Generals’ top runner, coming in
fifth with a time of 29:26 for the
five mile course. The winner was
D&E’s Mike Redman with a time
of 28:03. W&L also had the sev-
enth and eighth place finishers in
freshman Richard Bird (29:49), a
native of Lexington and sopho-
more Jim Frantz (30:02)

Coach Dick Miller’s runners
have their next meet on October
2nd, competing in a_ tri-meet
against Norfolk State and Roa-
noke in Salem, Va.

Flesher's sports outloo

By BILL FLESHER

Of this and that (or how to fill
space when the idea bin is
temporarily empty):

It may seem odd for a team
from Wahooland to be invading
Lexington any time before April
or May, but such a visit will occur
next Wednesday.

That’s when W&L’s soccer team
hosts Virginia for the first time
in many a year. The game gets
underway at 3 p.m. on Wilson
Field.

The Cavaliers perenially field
one of the state’s better soccer
squads, although in recent years
they have been surpassed by Madi-
son as the top team in the Com-
monwealth.

Coached by Larry Gross, who
is lacrosse coach Glen Thiel’s as-
sistant, Virginia’s squad includes
several of those who have never
experienced victory over a_par-
ticular W&L team (guess which
one).

Any W&L-UVa matchup pro-
vides for some interesting oc-
currences, and this one should be
no exception, especially if the

Generals can get it going during

this weekend’s two-game swing in

Greensboro against Guilford and

UNC-Greensboro.
ne % a

W&L athletics will be the
theme of half-hour shows on both
of the University electronic media
outlets this fall.

Cable 9-TV will air a weekly
show tentatively titled “The Gen-
erals Club” on Tuesday evening
at 7:15, while WLUR-FM (91.5
mhz) features a sports magazine-
type program Mondays at 5:30.

Both shows will center around
football during the fall, with film
highlights of previous games
shown on the television program.

As of this writing, WLUR has
no immediate plans regarding
play-by-play broadcasts of any of
the Generals’ away games, but at-
tempts to arrange them are in
the works.

oy ae an

That remark in last week’s
column about the Generals’ tennis
team becoming a national power
may not be so far-fetched.

Though a fifth-place finish in

last week’s Naval Academy In-
vitational wouldn't indicate it,
W&L proved it could play with
some of the best college teams in
the East, including Maryland, Vir-
ginia, and Navy.

Senior captain Ken Voelker
fared best for W&L, winning
three-set matches over John Irwin
of Swarthmore and Dalurton of
Virginia before dropping a three-
set semifinal match to Steve Mer-
chant of Navy.

The other point-scorer for the
Generals was a freshman doubles
team of Stewart Jackson and Pat
Norris, who downed Maryland’s
number two doubles team in three
sets.

Indicitave of how close the Gen-
erals were able to stay was junior
Ben Johns, who dropped two tie-
breakers to Maryland’s number
one player, John Olson, 7-6, 4-6,
7-6.

W&L travels to Madison for a
double dual meet with the Dukes
and William and Mary this week-
end. The Generals will host the
Fall State Tennis Tournament the
weekend of October 8-9-10.

 

Curator named

Capt. Robert © Peniston, a U.S.
Navy officer for 30 years until
his retirement jast summer, has
been named te the new post of
director of Lee Chapel.

He will have day-to-day ad-
ministrative responsibility for our
favorite Naional Historic Land-
mark.

Capt. Pemston’s appointment
was announced by James W.
Whitehead, chapel curator. The
changes in the chapel administra-
tion came after John E. Hughes,
chapel curator since 1968, left
W&L this fall to go into the in-
surance business.

Whitehead said Patrick C.
Brennan, senior, will remain as
student curator of the Chapel, a
post he has held for two years.

Capt. Peniston was director of
naval educational development at
Pensacola, Fla. at the time of
his retirement. In the capacity he
had responsibility for undergradu-
at and postgraduate programs at
the Naval Academy, in Navy
R.O.T.C. programs at 58 colleges
and universities, and elsewhere in
the field.

He has also had extensive man-
agement experience with the
Atlantic Fleet, where he directed
the activities of 300 ships and
1400 aircraft, and in the naval
personnel bureau. He was as-
sistant to the president of the
Naval War College from 1962 to
1964, and was commander of four
combat ships at various times be-
tween 1959 and 1971.

He is a graduate of the Naval
Academy and received _sihis
master’s degree-in personnel ad-
ministration from Stanford Uni-
versity. He holds a number of
decorations, including the Legion
of Merit and the Meritorious Ser-
vice Medal with two gold stars.

Ile is a native of Missouri and
is married to the former Frances
McKelvy of Washington, D.C.
They have a doughter, Lisa. Their
son, Robert Carl Peniston, was a
senior at W&L at the time of his
death in 1975, and it was that
connection with W&L that led
Penistons to move to Lexington.

Gooch estate donates
1.8 million to W&L

Washington and Lee University
has received more than $1.6 mil-
lion from the estate of the late
Richard E. Gooch of Lynchburg
and Lexington, a 1930 W&L gradu-
ate.

The larger share of the gift,
$1,523,000, is in the form of an
unrestricted bequest from his
estate. The remaining portion,
$97,386, is in the form of a life
insurance policy which Mr. Gooch
purchased specifically to benefit
W&L’s Department of Journalism
and Communications, one of his
primary interests.

The unrestricted $1.5-million
bequest will be used to help W&L
toward completion of the capital
construction portion of its on-
going development program for
the 1970s, the university said. In
addition to additions to physical
facilities, that development pro-
gram includes substantial addi-
tions to W&L’s permanent en.
dowment and support for annual
operating costs as well.

Mr. Gooch died Dec. 30, 1974,
at the age of 70. He was born in
Lynchburg, but spent most of
his life in Europe. He attended
the Darlington School in Rome,
Ga., and then W&L where he
earned the B.A. degree. He also
held a master’s degree from Duke
University.

Throughout his adult life he
was a steadfast supporter of W&L,
and it was largely his connection
with W&L that led him to acquire
an apartment in Lexington after
his retirement. He was a member
of the Generals’ Council, the
group of W&L’s most generous
benefactors, and was also an
ardent supporter of WLUR-FM,
the campus radio station. Among
the gifts he made to W&L during
his lifetime were many designated
for operating expenses, equip
ment purchases, and expansion of
the station

Through a geographical quirk,
Mr. Gooch was able to pick up

WLUR’s 10-watt signal in Lynch-
burg, 40 miles away, although a
signal of that strength usually
travels only a couple of miles. It
was a phenomenon that deepened
his interest in journalism broad-
casting at his alma mater, and he
became instrumental in enabl-
ing the station to increase its
signal strength to 180 watts.

Always interested in modern
communications technology, Mr.
Gooch also contributed a sophis-
ticated audio cassette system to
W&L’s McCormick Library as a
basic element in the “non-book”
information resource field. He
visited WLUR’s studios frequently
to watch the station’s operations,
and in recent years he gave an
elegant banquet each spring for
the university's graduating journ-
alism majors.

His bequest to W&L represents
50 per cent of his estate after a
number of specific bequests to
three Lynchburg churches, the
YMCA and YWCA, and the Hu-
mane Society. In addition to the
major W&L bequest, he left a
one-third share of the remainder
to the Darlington School, and
one-twelfth shares to Randolph.
Macon Woman's College and to
Lynchburg College.

The bequest was announced by
W&L President Robert E. R. Hunt-
ley, who remarked: “All of us
who knew Mr. Gooch both per-
sonally and as one of Washington
and Lee’s most loyal friends have
always been grateful for the
extraordinary measure of himself
he gave us during his lifetime.

“We are equally grateful to him
now for the carefully considered
ways in which he has helped to
ward the success of the cevelop
ment program in which he was
interested from the start, and the
endurance of the quality of the
university's educational programs
and physical facilities, attributes
which always meant much to
him.”

against the extra subtraction from
the SAB budget, saying “With the
schedule this year, I think the
students deserve all the parties
they can get.”

The Contact °77 speakers pro-
gram received $6700 with the
understanding that they may
come back to the E.C. if they need
more. Contact co-chairman Tom
Murphy said they may need more
cash if the Inter-Fraternity Coun-
cil does not come through with
their $3000 share of the series’
cost.

Finally, the Mock Convention
received $200 which will be used
mainly to pay administrative and
ollice costs for this academic year.
The MC co-chairmen, John Trump
and Jim Lawson, had asked for
54000 in order to begin an in-
vestment program that would
boost funds for the 1980 conven-
tion. The E.C. decided, however,
that money taxed from students
this year should be spent this
year and not on an event which
most of them will not see.

The MC was left with about
$1590 in bills from last Spring’s
convention. The bills will be paid
from a $10,000 check donated by
the Summer Foundation, a Texas-
based political study group. The
bills include $400 for a reception

In a simultaneous comment, the

ning Council, Edwin A. Morris,
of Greensboro, N.C., said: “This
bequest represents a critically im-
