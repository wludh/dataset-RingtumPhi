The Scene: The campus of
Washington and Lee University.
The Time: A balmy day in the
Spring of 1977.
The Characters: An un-
dernourished freshman, a

senior who is fat and delerious
from seven straight grain
parties, an ex-jock with
memories of glory and a body of

The Theme: All of the

Sunny Springs weekend

by Dee Dee Warren

There was a lot of energy
shown onstage Friday night in
Doremus Gym, perhaps more
than a_ sleepy Southern
university like W&L was able to
take.

From the vigorous
proselytization of Chris Rush
for the reform of marijuana
laws to the tight vocals of
Orleans, the stage was alive
with electronic and human

Boxwood
gift

by Rex Nyquist

Students going to class
Monday morning were greeted
with the sight of several English
boxwoods being placed near
Newcombe Hall. The boxwoods
— eighty in all — were given to
the university by the late
Wilmer S. Poinor, Jr., of Bir-
mingham, Alabama.

Mr. Poinor, whose son John is
a 1962 graduate of Washington
and Lee, was an avid boxwood
collector and had given three
previous gifts to the college.

In 1972 he gave the school
thirty-two boxwoods he had
purchased from a nursery in
Wytheville, Virginia. Two years
later he bought some property
in Floyd, Virginia that had a
number of boxwoods on it. He
gave the university fifty-one
bushes in 1974 and forty-eight in
1975. The first group was placed
near the President’s house and
the freshmen dorms, while the
third group went largely near
Parmly Hall.

Mr. Poinor had planned to
give Washington and Lee eighty
remaining boxwoods in similar
installments, but because of his
death the university agreed to
accept them all at once.

Frank Parsons, assistant to
the President, said . the
university is glad to have the
boxwoods. He noted a few
disadvantages to the gift,
though. One is that the
university has to pay the cost of

energy, most of it wasted with
only 1300 people present.

Rush, a former Lampoon
writer, whose routine was
strangely reminiscent of the
National Lampoon travelling
show here last year, highlighted
the incongruities of both the law
and the tests, scientific or not,
used to support those laws. The
topic was brought up early in
the routine of the self-confessed
evangelist for the National
Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws.

The validity of his ob-
servations on society was often
clouded by the method of
presentation. Who can ap-
preciate cynicism when it is
surrounded by imprecations of
a nature which would embarass
a longshoreman (more) for a
lack of style and content than
for effort.

Rush asked to be invited to
W&L when a comedian at last
year’s spring concert was booed

Bruce, Christie

by J. Michael Gallagher

In a packed Doremus
Gymnasium Tuesday night,
Contact committeeman Rob
Sult introduced Olympian
Decathlon gold medalist Bruce
Jenner to a crowd which
greeted him with an ovation
second only to that given for his
wife Christie.

It seemed predestined that
Christie, dressed in a white
satin silk shirt and tight fitting
black pants, would be a main
feature of the evening. Her
indentity unknown to the crowd,
she was ushered in and seated
to the tune of catcalls and
whistles prior to Bruce’s ap-
pearance. After Jenner let it be
known his wife was there and
introduced her, the crowd went
wild. When the roar died down
Jenner said, “Judging from the
ovation you gave my wife, it
looks like it’s been a long year
for you guys.”’

Jenner talked for ap-
proximately an hour con-
centrating on his philosophy for
succeeding in sports, which he
believes carries over into the
everyday world. He said that
life, just like sports, is very
competitive and the only way to
succeed is to believe with your
whole heart in what you are
doing.

opposed to a recommendation
by Dr. Jay D. Cook that in-
dependent exams be abolished.

Sandy Stradtman, vice
president of the E. C., said Cook
made his recommendation at a
faculty meeting. Cook, a
professor of accounting, said
that information is getting out
before the end of exam periods
and that students are not taking
their exams in the room
assigned to them, according to
Stradtman.

Stradtman said the faculty
would vote on Cook’s proposal
“in the next week.” If the
faculty says ‘no more in-
dependent exams,’ there will be
no more independent exams,
said Stradtman. If independent
exams are abolished students
will have to take exams during
assigned periods.

Rather than take away the
privilege and convenience of
independent exams for the
majority who don’t cheat,
Stradtman recommended that
the faculty become more in-
volved in questions of honor. He
said the faculty should be
responsible for making sure
students understand they must
take exams in assigned rooms,
and should also make sure their
students know what constitutes
an honor violation.

Unfortunately, many faculty
members do not know what
constitutes an honor violation,
said Stradtman. In fact the

SAB disappointed
by Doug Dewing

After the debacle which was
Springs Weekend, the Student
Activities Board may be forced
to change the system of con-
certs at Washington and Lee.

Mike Armstrong, co-
chairman of the SAB, said that
the SAB took a bigger beating
during Springs weekend than
they did during Winter Concert.

While the totals are not yet in,
Armstrong said that the picture
looks bad. The entire weekend
cost almost $13,000. The Mar-
velettes on Thursday night cost
$950. Orleans cost $7500, Law
cost $2000 and Chris Rush, the
comedian, cost $800. Income
was estimated at about $3250, or
about 1300 persons at $2.50
apiece.

The SAB had hoped to cover
about half their costs in ticket
sales and were expecting a
large crowd because of the low
ticket price. Armstrong said he
had hoped for about 2,000
spectators.

The only bright spot in the
concert was that attendance
was better than at the Atlanta
Rhythm Section concert during
the winter.

SAB

(continued from page 1)

Armstrong said his com-
mittee faces a dilemma on the
matter of future concerts.
“While the students seem to
want to go to concerts, unless
the group is Marshall Tucker or
Earth Wind and Fire, the
students just don’t show.”’

According to Armstrong, the
SAB has very few choices for
the future. Either there should
be no more concerts, concerts
should be held jointly with some
other school, or the whole idea
of concerts should be re-
evaluated and smaller concerts
provided.

There are problems with all
three ideas.

Just dropping concerts would
not work, because of the student
demand for such a social ac-
tivity.

Joint concerts aren’t feasible
either. Every survey Arm-
strong has seen on the subject
shows that W&L students don’t
want to hold a concert with
VMI. A joint concert with one of
the women’s colleges didn’t
strike Armstrong as a good idea
either. First, they don’t have
the kind of money for such
events that W&L has had and
second, there would be conflict
over where a concert would be
held.

The third idea had more
appeal to Armstrong, but he
didn’t know if it would work at
all. That idea was smaller
concerts, with only one artist,
who would do two or more
shows in a very brief period,
almost like nightclub dates. He
suggested having an artist like
Jimmy Buffet come to W&L and
put on two small shows. This
would cost a little more, but
might work.

The .coffee-house circuit
performers, who perform in the
Cockpit in such a_ nightclub
situation, have met many
difficulties and the program has
had little student support.

Armstrong summed the
situation up saying, “To get a
good group, we’ve got to spend
over $10,000. If you only take in
$2,000, you’re hurting.”

YD’s receive award Sunny Springs

(continued from page 1)

by Rex Nyquist

The Washington and Lee
Young Democrats received the
best small-college Democratic
club award at the Virginia
Young Democrat state con-
vention last weekend. The
convention was held at the
Sheraton Red Lion Inn in
Blacksburg.

In addition, three Washington
and Lee Young Democrats, all
freshmen, were elected to state-
wide offices at the convention.

Tony Carli was. elected
Secretary of the Virginia
college Democrats; David

Garner was named Sixth
District College Co-ordinator;
and Glen Washington was
elected Sixth District
Secretary.

Next Thursday, April 28, the
YD’s will host a debate between
Henry Howell and Andrew
Miller, the Virginia guber-
natorial candidates in the
Democratic primary. The
debate will be held in Lee
Chapel at 8 p.m. It will be
moderated by John Jackley, a
senior at Washington and Lee. A
panel consisting of Mel Carrico
of the Roanoke Times, James
Latimer of the Richmond
Times-Dispatch, and Walter
Crockett of Bristol’s TV station
will ask the candidates
questions.

Prior to the debate the Rock-
bridge County Democratic
Committee will hold a dinner at
the Robert E. Lee Episcopal
Church.

E. C. extended an invitation to
new faculty members to meet
with members of the committee
to discuss the issue of honor, but
not a single faculty member
came, said Stradtman.

One member of the audience
thought the faculty’s ignorance
was not confined to matters of
honor. Citing the long waiting
lines at the Commerce School
for finals to be handed out, he
said, ‘‘they have Ph.D.s in
administration, but they don’t
even know how to hand out
exams.”’

The six groups requesting and
receiving funds were the
Student Activities Board,
Washington & Lee ROTC
Rangers, Student Arts Fair,
Cold Check Committee,
lacrosse team pep rally and the
first annual Ring-tum Phi Road
Race.

The SAB requested $2,100 for
parties after the Virginia and
Maryland lacrosse games, and
for a party at the pavilion a
week after the Maryland game.
Mike Armstrong, co-chairman
of the SAB, said _ the
organization could not afford to
pay for the $4,000 worth of
parties coming up in the next
three weeks because the SAB
“took a bigger beating in the
Springs concert than in the
Winter concert.”’

Armstrong said only about
1,300 persons attended the
Springs Weekend concert. The
concert cost about $14,000, he
said, but the small attendance
and other ‘‘circumstances
beyond our control’’ caused the
SAB to lose much more money
than it planned.

Armstrong said about half of
the money could be returned to
the reserve fund if the SAB
makes the expected big profit
on its mid-May ‘‘porn flick.”’ So
the E. C. voted to loan the SAB
the $2,100 until part of it could
be payed back.

The W&L ROTC Rangers
received $1,000 for the purchase
of four canoes. The canoes will
be stored in the ROTC building
and may be used by any
member of the W&L com-
munity.

The E. C. gave $500 to Dan
Scott for a student arts fair. The
fair will run for three days this
Spring. It will stretch from the
collonade to Lee Chapel and will
feature art exhibitions, plays,
mime shows, bands, literature
and even kite-flying, said Scott.

The Cold Check Committee
received $300 to cover the
hundreds of bad checks that
have been written by students
this Spring. Bob Couch, who
came before the E. C. with the
request, said this is an annual
thing and that last year it was
even worse when about 700 cold
checks had to be covered. The
E. C. granted the money from
the reserve fund.

Bill Flesher came before the
committee to request $150 for
beer for the pep rally before the
Virginia lacrosse game. He
eventually received $200, and
vowed he would spend every
cent of it on beer. At $27 a keg,
the pep rally should have over
20 kegs of beer.

The E. C. also gave $150 to
Mike Gallagher for the First
Annual Ring-tum Phi Road
Race. The money will be used to
get publicity for the race, which
will start in Lexington Center,
proceed along 15 miles of road
and end with one lap around
W&L’s outdoor track. Anyone
can enter the race, and the
proceeds will go to the Multiple
Sclerosis Foundation, said
Gallagher. A $2 entry fee will be
required. All participants will
receive a T-shirt and trophies to
the first three places.

landscape.”’

off the stage, figuring the
audience would prove a real
challenge.

The concert, now don’t ask
me why a comedian was at a
concert, finally started with
MCA recording artists Law, a
group which contains one
former James Gana member
Jim Fox. Their music was loud,
rowdy, raucous, and
progressivelyy worse.

Many listeners felt the best
material was played during the
first few songs of the set, and I
have to agree. ‘‘Wake up,
Everybody,’’ ‘‘That’s what
Love Can Do For You,’’
“Climbing for Shelter,’ and
“Love is a Dream” led into a
fine instrumental which showed
off the artist at their most
versatile. As far as I could tell,
that should have been the end of
their set.

The sound was a mixture of
powerful rock, with maybe a

Cockpit

Gameroom

Plans

Attendants are now on duty in
the game room of the W&L
Cockpit.

The program, begun last
week, is the idea of manager
Jerry Darrell.

Darrell said the game room
faced the problem of destruc-
tion of the walls and rug due to a
lack of supervision. The at-
tendants will provide’ that
supervision.

In addition, they will provide
a service to the students by
supplying change for the games
and pool cues and balls for those
who want to play pool, which
will be free during Spring term.

Darrell said that the Cockpit
would install ping-pong tables in
the game room this week, and
chess and checker sets soon. He
also hopes’ to _— supply
backgammon sets and darts
sometime in the future. The
attendants would also issue that
equipment.

Spring break was used to
beautify the game room,
Darrell said. A new coat of paint
went on the walls which had
been defaced by shoes and
cigarettes. Darrell also said a
plastic runner would be in-
stalled under the pinball tables
to decrease the number of
cigarette burns in the rug,
which had been installed last
November, and ruined in less
than a year.

Darrell emphasized that the
attendants are there to provide
a Service to students and that he
felt the student center was for
students. There will be few
regulations in the game room
and what regulations there are
will be enforced by students.

Attendants go on duty every
day at 3 p.m. and are on duty
until the Cockpit closes. The
pinball machines will be
available for use for those with
exact change as soon as the
Cockpit opens.

touch too much bass, and a
jazzed-up Jamaican sound, But
after those first few songs, the
music deteriorated to mere
amplification.

The last song of the set could
best be described as a circus,
with the lead singer of Law
moving to the front of the stage
encouraging audience par-
ticipation by passing around a
bottle, reportedly of Jack
Daniels.

Law was contrasted by
Orleans, which presented what
seemed a too short concert
which mixed some surprising
good rockers with acoustic
numbers and a calypso comedy-
satire number called
“Plutonium is Forever.”

Orleans’ lead vocalist was a
clean cut short hair whose
appearance was compared to
Keith Carradine by some
listeners, just not the sort of
person you would think was
worried about Strontium 90,

Despite some __ technical
problems with the lights and the
sound system, he kept part of
the audience on its feet the
whole hour the group played.
The floor of the basketball gym
was bouncing in time to the
people keeping time with the
music, a phenomenon not ap-
parent during the Law section
of the concert.

There was some dancing,
bumping and a lot of swaying on
the floor for most of the set.

Most of the concert was
composed of new material from
their latest album. ‘‘Sweet
Dreamer” seemed to receive
the best reception with much of
the floor crowd up and cheering.
“Dance with Me” and “Still the
One,”’ the singles from their last
album received the _ best
reception overall.

“‘Here in My Memory’”’ a quiet
acoustic piece also gets good
marks for its pleasant, upbeat,
yet contemplative mood. What
that means I liked it, but so did
a lot of other people.

Some of the spectators began
to leave during a blues piece
also from the new album. From
that point on the outflow seemed
“I’m a Bum’’ slowed the out-
pouring and “Still the One’
even brought some people back
in the gym, to hear the last song
of the set.

After that, people began
streaming out the doors, yet
Orleans came back for an en-
core, which not many people
stayed around for. By the end of
the concert, almost half of the
already meager audience had
left.

Probably the most successful
event of the weekend was, as
might be suspected, the grain
party at Zollman’s Pavillion,
Despite a few cases of
overindulgence, a crowd which
might have hit 700 or maybe
even 1000, seemed to enjoy the
sun, the creek and the grain
punch.

From the girl with ‘‘Call Me”
emblazoned on her shirt
(number available on request),
to the sunbathers who parked
their jeeps in the middle of the
creek, a good time seemed to be
had by most all involved.

Perhaps the university should
give up on concerts and just put
the money into parties.

Troub

on the

Move

by Dan Williams

The Washington and Lee
University Theater will produce
a new and unique experience in
the total theater production this
spring in the Old Boiler Room
Theater beneath the Old Main
Street mall, starting May 14 and
continuing through May 21.

The production, keeping with
the age-old theme of the
repretory theater, will include
two different and contrasting
plays by two great American
playwrights. Neil Simon’s
comedy in three acts, ‘“‘Barefoot
in the Park,’’ and Arthur
Miller’s two-act tragedy,
“Death of a Salesman’”’ will be
presented. The two plays will be
produced on alternate nights at
8:00 p.m., with matinees on
May 14 and 15 at 2:00 p.m.

“Barefoot in the Park” will be
directed by Bob Carpentier, a
senior drama major, while
“Death of a Salesman’”’ will be
directed by John Hollinger, also
a senior drama major. Both
Carpentier and Hollinger will be
directing the plays as a
fulfillment of their senior thesis.

Bob Carpentier has directed,
in the past, August Strindberg’s
“The Stronger” and has acted
in such plays as ‘‘The Man of
Mode’”’ and ‘‘Steambath.’’

“Barefoot in the Park’’ will be -

_his first major production.

John Hollinger has directed
“Memory of two Mondays’”’ and
has acted in the ‘‘Fantasticks,”’
“Three Penny Opera,” “‘Cat on
a Hot Tin Roof,” ‘‘Steambath,”’
as well as contributing his
talents to the mime show
produced earlier this year.

venner

The cast of both productions
will be composed of Washington
and Lee University students
and faculty, as well as several
residents of the Lexington area.

For ‘Barefoot in the Park”
the cast will include W&L
students Paul Morella, John
Ellis and Seth Oserin, and
Lexington residents Carol
Phemister, Rose Gordon and
Tom Ziegler.

The cast of “Death of a
Salesman’’ is __ presently
scheduled to include students
Warren Mowry, Ty York, Rich
Allen, Brian Garr, Paul Cella,
Hub Kennedy, Chip Brown,
Barbara Minneg and ¢Art
Bloom; and Lexington residents
Betty Kahn, June Morgan,
Phyllis Davis and Ginger
McNeese.

Tickets for both productions
will go on sale May 9 at the box
office of the Old Boiler Room
Theater. All ticket reservations
must be secured in advance of
all shows. The price of ad-
mission will be free to all
Washington and Lee University
students and faculty, and $1.50
to all others.

Jenner used his own success
story as an illustration. He said
he entered the trials for the ’72

Olympics with no hope of |

qualifying. But as the trials
progressed he saw his name
move up the standings board
and he realized that he could
finish in the top three (thus
qualifying). For the last event
(1500 meters) he believed in
himself so much that he finished
in the top ahead of the pack and
bettered his previous personal
best by 8 seconds. He carried
his illustration up to the ’76
Olympics where he set personal
bests in six of ten events, at-
tributing it all to his strong
belief in himself and what he
was doing.

During the question and
answer session, Jenner said
that there were no longer any
amateur athletes in the world,
not even in the U. S. He believes
that a central sports
organization should be set up,
funded by the government and
corporations to support
amateur athletes while training
for the Olympics. Such a
proposal has been put before
President Carter and Jenner is
disappointed that he hasn’t

acted on it yet.

He also said that contrary to
popular belief, athletes in the
Olympics could care less about
the politics involved. They
regard each other as in-
dividuals, not as part of a
nationality. He considers all his
olympic opponents as ‘‘good,
personal friends, because I
have known them for years.”’

All in all, it made for a light
evening with Jenner flavoring
his talk with numerous sports
jokes. But the anecdote that
drew the largest response was
which his wife said, ‘“You need
more ‘tail’ to get your kite up.”’
Jenner later brought his wife up
to the podium to help field
questions. .

Before leaving the gym to
attend a reception at the Sigma
Chi house, Jenner was
presented a plaque containing
the W&L monogram by track
co-captains John Tucker and
Paul Thompson. Tucker said to
Jenner, ‘‘Since you are now an
honorary member of the team
and we have a meet tomorrow,
we invite you to participate.”
Jenner must have been thinking
to himself, ‘‘Are you kidding
me?’’, when he respectfully
declined.

Jenner shows technique.

   

Former Ambassador to visit

Lord Caradon, former British
ambassador to the United
Nations and widely experienced
diplomat, will be in residence at
Washington and Lee University
next week (April 24-29) for a
public lecture and a number of
private meetings with students.

Lord Caradon will speak on
“Three Danger’ Areas:
Southern Africa, the Middle
East, and Cyprus’’ Monday
evening at 7:30 in the Moot
Court Room of Lewis Hall. The
public is invited without charge.

Lord Caradon, a life peer born
as Hugh Foot, is a career
foreign officer. He entered the
Colonial Office following his
graduation from St. John’s
College, Cambridge, and was
assigned to Palestine and
served in some of the most
troublesome areas there during
the 1930’s. In 1943, he went to
Cyprus as colonial secretary,
and became Governor in 1944.
He then served in Jamaica and
Nigeria, acting as governor for
short periods of time in both
countries. In 1951, he was ap-
pointed captain-general and
governor in chief of Jamaica.

In Nigeria and Jamaica he
played a major part in the
preparation and development of
the first constitutions and in-
ternal self government.

Lord Caradon served as
minister of state for foreign and

 

Commonwealth affairs and
United Kingdom representative
to the UN from 1964 to 1970.
Since then he has undertaken
assignments for the UN in north
Africa and elsewhere, and has
traveled widely in the Middle
East.

During his week at W&L,
Lord Caradon will meet with
classes at the university and
with students during his office
hours.

His visit is sponsored by the
Woodrow Wilson Foundation’s
Visiting Fellows Program,
which fosters better un-
derstanding among students
and teachers through personal
contact.

Washington and Lee is one of
105 colleges, mostly small
liberal arts institutions, which
participate in the Woodrow
Wilson Visiting Fellows
Program.

The Fellows are represen-
tatives of business, journalism,
diplomacy and various other
professions who spend a week
or more on campus, meeting
classes, joining in seminars and
panel discussions, and visiting
informally with students,
teachers and administrators
about their careers and
professions.

The program is sponsored by
the Lilly Foundation.

by J. Michael Gallagher

The ‘‘world’s greatest
athlete’’ gave a clinic on Wilson
Field Tuesday afternoon for the
benefit of the track team and
the stands filled with adolescent
and preadolescent female
worshippers. A crowd of about
300 turned out to hear Bruce
Jenner give instruction in how
to train for and what technique
to use in the decathlon.

Before the clinic, Jenner
talked a little about the event
itself and how it has affected
him.

“The decathlon is the only
measurable competitive event
of a person’s athletic ability. It
took me 12 years of training to
win it and I have no qualms
about being called ‘‘the world’s
greatest athlete’. Sure if I was
to get out on the gridiron with
OJ Simpson he would bowl me
over. He’s the best at what he
does but that is the only thing he
does. The decathlon covers
everything you could possible
do in any sport. It measures
your ability to run, jump, and
throw. A decathloner has to
train hard for all of these, every
ten events.”

“In the decathlon, you aren’t
really in competition with other
nations or individuals, but
rather with yourself, always
trying to reach a new high for
yourself in each event. You are
also competing against the
pressure of the Olympics and
the records of the past
American greats, Bob Mat-
thius, Rafer Johnson, Bill
Toomey.”’

Winning the decathlon has
changed the lives of Jenner and
his wife. Their lives have
become more public, so much
that he has learned to ap-
preciate his private life. When

T-ballers

he first started training in San
Jose, Calif., no one knew him.
Now, from the front of
‘“‘Wheaties” to ABC television
commentator, he receives
extensive coverage.

During the clinic, he talked
about how he had trained for the
Olympics. He spent the first
half of his time on endurance.
He ran alot and worked on the
quantity of his exercises. Not
only did he run but he
weightlifted and he credits his
success to this.

“You gotta lift. If you take
two guys of comparable ability
in any event or sport, the
stronger guy always wins out.
During my training I con-
centrated on squats, clean and
jerks, and incline bench with
dumbbells.”’

The second half of his training
consisted of quality not quantity
in his exercise routine. He
concentrated on the specifics
and techniques of each event.

He maintains that he didn’t
have a particular diet, but just
ate regular meals. He did ingest
63 pills a day, though, ranging
from potassium, iron, and
vitamin complexes, to One-a-
Day. He doesn’t know whether
or not it helped him, but at the
time, he psychologically felt
it did. He does know that it gave
him ‘‘the most expensive urine
in the world.”’

During his workouts with the
team in which he demonstrated
the techniques he used in the
different events, he repeatedly
pointed out that the training
aspect of any sport was 80 per
cent physical and 20 per cent
mental. He stressed that, ‘You
must believe in yourself and in
what you are doing if you are
going to succeed in life.’’ This
set the mood for the evening’s
Contact talk.

bounce back

by Jim Barnes

After a disappointing road
trip over the spring break the
W&L netters bounced back to
take three out of five matches
during the first week of the
spring semester. Prior to the
trip, the Washington and Lee
tennis team was ranked 11th in
the nation among Divison III
schools. The Generals traveled
to Florida, Georgia, and North
Carolina to face strong op-
ponents, who, not unexpectedly,
handed W&L five losses. W&L
suffered substantial defeats
from the University of Florida,
8-1, Rollins, 9-0, Georgia Tech,

6-3, and Davidson, 6-3. The
Generals were trimmed by the
University of Tampa, 5-4. The
W&L netters avoided a shutout
by beating Eckerd College, 7-2.

Some encouraging factors
were seen on the trip south.
Freshman Stewart Jackson had
a fine record of 4-2 for the trip at
his number 2 singles spot which
included an impressive win
over the University of Florida’s
John Kunman, who posted a 32-4
record last year. Jackson also
triumphed over Georgia Tech’s,
Davidson’s, and Eckerd’s
number 2 singles man. At the

No. 7 Generals vs No. 6 UVa.

by Bill Flesher

Charlie Brown swears he’ll
keep his promise.

“‘Last year,”’ the 1976 second-
team All-American goalie
started, ‘I played better in the
first half of the year than I did
later in the season.”

“This year I promised myself
that I’d save the best for last.’’

And, as Washington and Lee’s
lacrosse team faced two critical
games on the road last week,
Brown effectively embarked on
keeping his word.

The junior netminder turned
away 25 shots Wednesday as the
Generals stifled an explosive
North Carolina team 13-7, then
came back with a 16-save
performance Saturday as W&L
bested Towson State by an
identical count.

In improving their record to 7-
2, as well as jumping from tenth
to seventh in this week’s
USILA lacrosse poll, the
Generals dominated two teams
which had given them fits in
recent years. The win at Chapel
Hill was W&L’s first over UNC
since 1974, while not since 1972
had the Generals handled the
Tigers with such relative ease.

“Tt was a great week for us,
especially with what we have
coming up,” said W&L coach
Jack Emmer. “We had twe
very good games from the point
of team defense, while on of-
fense we just kept running and
eventually outran both our
opponents.”’

For all practical purposes,
W&L had won both games long
before the final whistle. After
trading goals to a 2-2 standoff,
the Generals scored eight goals
over a 33-minute stretch in
which every Tar Heel scoring

effort was thwarted by the
stingy W&L defense.

While four of the goals came
in extra-man situations, Em-
mer credited good ball
movement by the Generals as
the key to breaking the game
open.

“Tt wasn’t the standard sort of
fast break where the outlet pass
from the goalie might give you
four on three, but it was our
offensive players continually
moving that gave us good
scoring opportunities,’’ said
Emmer, who was surprised by
what he termed ‘‘a lack of of-
fense by Carolina” throughou
the third quarter.

Jay Sindler led W&L scorers
with three goals and an assist,
while Stieff, Mark Derbyshire,
and Johnny Black joined
Kearney with two each.

Yevoli led all players with
four goals.

The Generals demonstrated a

Track Men
Hobble to 3-1

Last year’s outdoor track club
had a reputation of losing the
close meets. But after
squeaking out their third
straight victory over the Spring
Break, nobody could say that
about this year’s team.
However, a continuous rash of
crippling injuries is making it
difficult to sustain that record.

The Generals captured an
exciting victory in the first
home meet of the year defeating
Eastern Mennonite 76-69. That
win was secured when W&L
won the last event of the day,
the mile relay. W&L then
traveled to Wake Forest where
they lost to the host team but
overcame Emory and Henry
College by three points.

At Wake Forest the Generals
suffered the loss of co-captain
John Tucker with a recurrent
hamstring injury and _high-
jumper Tony Perry with a back
injury. And co-captain Paul
Thomson continued to be
hampered by Strained
ligaments in his knee.

Even though the injuries
make the future cloudy, the
team still relished a 3-1 record.
Strong performances in the
sprints by Larry Banks, Jack

Norberg and John Tucker have
carried a large load all season.
Meanwhile, Phil Dunlay and
Hank Phillips are giving the
Generals a steady scoring due
to the weight events.

The Generals now face the
bulk of their schedule including
several conference foes. If they
can overcome the injuries and
perform better, the end of the
season could find them at the
head of the league.

similar dominance three days
later under the lights at Towson
State. After the Tigers had
jumped to an early 2-0 lead, the
Generals scored nine of the next
10 goals, including six in a row
in the second period.

A four-goal spurt in the third
quarter put W&L ahead, 13-4,
also creating an atmosphere
along the Generals’ bench
which Emmer noted “led to
some breakdowns in the final
period that we’d best get out of
our system soon.’’

Again it was the W&L running
game that enabled the offense
to explode in spurts. Jeff Fritz
scored twice with 12 seconds in
the second-quarter blitz, while
Black followed with one of his
game-high four goals just
19 seconds later.

Meanwhile Brown was adding
a dangerous but exciting
dimension to the W&L offense,
straying far from the cage on
several clearing occasions, one
time going all the way only to
have a shot on goal knocked
away by Tiger goalie Paul
Russo.

“Once in a while Charlie’s got
to cool it out of the cage — it cost
us a couple of times last week,”’
said Emmer.

“But C. B. had an excellent
week in goal (Brown was
named the outstanding player
in the UNC game), and there’s
no way we'll be telling him to
hold back down the stretch.”

W&L fans surely hope that
will be the case. For Charlie
Brown has a promise he wishes
to keep.

Soccer in the spring

by Kenneth Smith

With everything else going on
at W&L, it hardly seems
possible that in the spring a
young man’s fancy would turn
to soccer. Surely more
traditional spring sports such as
baseball or lacrosse would have
greater appeal for the W&L
sportsman than soccer. But
after talking to soccer coach
Rolf Piranian, I found that I
could not have been more
wrong. Piranian was up on the
practice fields when I finally
tracked him down pitching in a
combination — softball-lacrosse
game. But when the whistle
blew to end practice, lacrosse
was the farthest thing from his
mind, for soccer spring practice
is just around the corner. “On
May second we'll start prac-
ticing. Anyone interested in
playing next fall must attend so
that we can get some idea of
what the team will be like.”

Moreover it is not as though
these practices will be attended
by just a few hearty souls.
Coach Piranian fully expects
that there may be as many as
seventy people out for the team
this year despite the fact that
last year’s team finished with a
three and ten mark. When I
asked him about the record he
pointed to the competition that
the team faced. “We are a
division three school that plays
a schedule loaded with division
one teams. In this way we gain
excellent experience.” In other
words, the record does not
reflect the progress made
during the season, a tired cliche
which everyone has heard at
least one hundred times before.
Coach Piranian is determined
to turn the program around and
to force other schools to use the
cliches.

It has not been that way for a
long time. Thinking back, he
told me that since W&L soccer
started in 1946, the program has
been a series of ups and downs.
In 1964 as a matter of fact W&L
went to the Division ITI playoffs.
After the season, coach
Piranian remembers that his
senior year the soccer team,
which he was a part of, finished
7-2. But since then, W&L soccer
has suffered through a long
drought.

Sports

Basketball coach Verne
Canfield, already ODAC coach
of the year, was named Division
III district III Coach-of-the
year. Pat Dennis was named
the outstanding College
Division Player in Virginia.

After the 1976-77 fall and
winter sports seasons, the
Generals hold a slim edge over
the Lynchburg Hornets in the
race for overall supremacy in
the ODAC.

Former pro and W&L football
great, Walt Michaels ’51, has
been inducted into the Virginia
Sports Hall of Fame. Michaels
is presently head coach of the
New York Jets.

But he passed over these
years to talk about the plans he
has made for next year’s team.
‘‘What we’re striving for and
what I think we’re ac-
complishing is a certain con-
sistency. We want to be con-
sistently good.”’ Well this goal is
all well and good, but how does
he plan to achieve it aside from
scheduling Division I schools.
Obviously practice is the an-
swer. He wanted to emphasize
that, “soccer is a year round
sport. What I think a lot of
people don’t realize is that after
our regular season in the fall we
also have an indoor season in
the winter. We play up in the old
gym and even some of the
football players join us.
Recently we just came back
from a big tournament in
Roanoke. Now we have spring
practice coming up.”

Turning away from the
practice schedule, I asked him
about what support soccer gets
from the campus_- and
surrounding community. “Well,
not too much really,’ he
replied. ‘‘Most of the people in
the stands are football players
who are getting ready to start
practice. Though we do ap-
preciate their watching us, it
does bother the players that
there are not many people in the
stands. I don’t worry about it
that much. I’m just trying to
improve the program and
maybe with more success more
people will come out to see us.”

Dr. Frederic Schwab, a

950th out of a field of 3,000
runners in the classic Boston
Marathon Monday. Schwab,
who called the race “‘the most
exciting thing I’ve ever done,”’
said today that it took him four
minutes to reach the starting
line because of the ‘flood of
people’ in the race. The veteran
runner made the race in three
hours, three minutes, moving in
80 degree weather — “‘It was a
little warm’? — and at times
through a narrow corridor of
people 10 feet deep. As he and
other runners reached the finish
line, Schwab said, ‘‘there were
100,000 people screaming like
mad.”

Running for MS

(Continued from page 1)

the W&L and Lexington com-
munity.

A number of students, in-
cluding the _ irrespressible
Gallagher, have already begun
training for the 15-mile run.
Jerry Darrell, the local
chairman for the MS drive, has
indicated he will serve liquid
refreshments to the runners at
various checkpoints. Lexington
City Manager John Doane and
the Highway Department have
agreed to help with the control
of traffic and crowds along the
race route. Several of the area
merchants, including Pres
Brown’s, The Lexington
Bookstore, Schewell’s Fur-
niture, Hess’s Jewelry and
Dixon’s Exxon, have agreed to
sponsor the race. And both the
Young Republicans and Young
Democrats have offered their
services. In fact, the two clubs
have hinted at challenging each
other to run during the race.

Gallagher noted that the race
started as an idea to involve the
many members of the W&L
community who like to run in an
annual event — a mini-version
of the Boston Marathon. The
idea evolved into a larger scale
charity race when Pat Falls, a
MS spokesman for the area,
approached Gallagher about
donating the proceeds to MS.

By involving MS in the event,
Gallagher noted that ‘‘not only
will we be helping MS but it
gives the race a meaning, a
cause.’’ He pointed out that the
MS fund drive only collected
$1,000 in the Lexington area last
year. It is hoped that the added
incentive helping out a worthy
cause such as MS will attract
more runners, including some
from Roanoke and Lynchburg,
which will in turn mean more
money for the fund.

The race will begin at 10 a.m.
in front of the County Court-
house on Main Street. From
there the contestants will run on
Rt. 11 to Rt. 631. The route will
follow 631 to Rt. 624 and then to
Rt. 625. From 625 the runners
will rejoin 631 which they will
travel till reaching Rt. 60. They
will run on 60 to the Liberty Hall
access road, past the Woods
Creek apartments, back to Rt.
60 to the stadium access road,
and finally end up by running
one lap around the track at
Wilson Field. The top three
runners will get a trophy
donated by Press Brown’s and
each entrant will receive a T-
shirt with the name of the race
printed on it. The T-shirt gives
the runners ‘“‘something to
remember the race by and is
also a form of publicity for the
future’’ according to Gallagher.

Wahoos in Wonderland

Once upon a time there was a
sleepy little school in a sleepy
little town in a beautiful and
green valley with mountains all
around. The students at the
school were like those anywhere
else — some slept all the time,
some played, others walked
around with their noses buried
in big thick books. During the
Spring there seemed to be fewer
and fewer with their noses in
books; most bought inner tubes
and spent their Saturday af-
ternoons floating in big pools of
beer and Southern Comfort.

Alas, it seemed for a long
time that none of these boys
could become interested in
anything but reading or floating
all day long. Until one day one
got the bright idea of tying a net
on the end of a pole and tossing
a ball with it. Soon everyone in
the sleepy little town was
running up and down the
football field waving their
sticks, hitting each other with
them, and having a glorious
time.

Then, word of the Wahoos
came to town. No one knew
what a Wahoo was or where the
Wahoos came from. They
carried sticks just the same,
tossed the ball quickly from one
to the other — and the people in
the little town were sore afriad.

Then the people said, ‘‘Why
don’t we leave the books and our
inner tubes and join together to
beat the Wahoos back?’’ And it
was done. The books were.
tossed aside, and the lovely
pools were drunk dry — and
everyone gathered together and
traveled to the Green to end the
Wahoos threat once and for all.
The battle began.

The Wahoos looked mean and
fierce. Most people thought the
Wahoos were meaner and
fiercer than the people of the
sleepy little school. But as the
battle began, a CB* gritted his
teeth and said, ‘‘The Wahoos
aren’t that tough.’’ And sending
their Keigs and Duds and all the
rest on the field, the people of
the beautiful and green valley
beat the Wahoos and showed
them who was meaner and
tougher.

It is said that the people of the
sleepy little school will never be
the same again. They are no
longer afraid of anyone. They
have their CB, their Keigs, their
Duds, and all the rest. And they
have a reason to drink up those
beautiful little pools of beer and
Southern Comfort. The End.

Even though the event is

scale this year, Gallagher in-

the future. ‘‘My hopes for the

Monday night even though only
$100 was requested.

Golfers win

6 THE RING-TUM PHI

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Welcome to the new Ring-+tum Phi.

The Ring-+tum Phi, while glad of the opportunity to
move into the twentieth century in terms of printing
technology, does so with some feelings of regret. In
making this leap, we leave behind the friendly and
familiar environs of the University Print Shop, where
the Ringtum Phi has flourished — well, lived,
anyway — for many years. We have always con-
sidered the members of the Print Shop staff to be our
personal friends. They will be missed, even if we are
not.

Readjusting to a whole new system is difficult and
will take some time, hence the decision to go ahead
with it now, for the remainder of the Spring term,
rather than wait and attempt the conversion in the
Fall. The move would probably never have been
made at all had it not been forced upon us by “‘higher
powers’? — the University administration, who, in
their relentless search for economy and efficiency,
are planning to eliminate most of the high-quality
print facilities at W&L. My personal feeling toward
this sort of C-school mentality is one of disgust.

On the positive side, the offset capabilities of The

_News-Gazette, our new printers, will allow the
Ringtum Phi more room for more stories, much
greater freedom in terms of layout and graphics, and
will give our staff valuable experience in modern
print techniques. We look forward to a friendly and
fruitful working relationship with the staff of the
News-Gazette, and hope that our newly-expanded
capacities will continue to serve the best interests of
the University community.

The page one gloss of the results of the Publications
Board elections does not tell the whole story of what
went on during those most weighty deliberations. I
am in a strange position here — voting member of the
Board, reporter on the Board’s actions, and editorial
commentator on those actions — caught between
libertarian dedication to freedom of the press and
concern for the possible effects of total revelation on
the upcoming election for Ring-tum Phi editor. The
division on the Board fell along political, ideological
and personal lines. One of the candidates for editor at
the time of the first meeting, around whom much of
the controversy was centered, is under consideration
again, and I do not wish to influence his candidacy. On
the other hand, the University community has as
much right to know what the Publications Board does
as it has to know what any other official body does.
Not that too many people care. Next week: the whole
story.

I am not “eating crow” over the fact that Joe
Fitzgerald has withdrawn from the University and
will not be able to serve as editor of next year’s Ring-
tum Phi. Rather, I view his departure with greater
regret than I have felt over anything else that has
happened during this long and difficult year. The
Ring-tum Phi will suffer most immediately; in my
view, the University as a whole has been diminished.

Lee lacrosse is in danger. The
future in this case concerns not
only a matter of weeks and
months but also years. The
danger is to the quality of W&L
lacrosse, and the cause of the
threat is the cross and ob-
noxious behavior of many W&L
fans. In this current season, we
fans are enjoying the best
lacrosse contests, against the
nation’s toughest teams, that
have ever been seen in
Lexington. Indeed, I believe
that most fans realize this, and
do truely appreciate how for-
tunate we are to have such high
quality Division I competition
at such a small school as ours.
To think of our Spring term
without this to enjoy is a virtual
nightmare. But this is what is
going to occur in the future, and
we may give thanks to our
unintelligent fans who hurl a
barrage of beer cans and ob-
scentities upon our opponents.
This behavior is _ being
generalized as the typical
behavior of the entire W&L
crowd by almost all of the other
schools we play. As a result,
many of these schools are
showing a reluctance to re-
schedule us. The University of
Maryland and Navy gave
strong implications that this
was the reason they refused to
reschedule us. With this con-
tinued behavior, the trend could
easily continue to point where
our “Ultimate in Springtime
Entertainment” will be con-
stituted of grade B lacrosse.
This would truly be a fine ac-
complishment by us, the W&L
““Gentlemen.”’

and we all realize the im-
portance of the psychological
edge in lacrosse. A less talented
team with a good attitude and a
spirited, supportive crowd
behind them can many times
defeat a more talented team.
The crowd support here is the
key. A crowd that hurls ob-
scenities does not support, it
destroys. It destroys their own
integrity and respect, but also
the team with which they are
associated. We need completely
POSITIVE support. Scream,
yell and cheer, be heard, but
make sure it’s positive. It is far
more effective in bolstering our
team and demoralizing theirs
(Think - honestly - What would
you rather hear if you were on
the field working your butt
off?). By doing this, we can

alter the course on which we are
headed in future years, and
make our team the NCAA
champions in the coming
weeks.

We can start on Friday. At 7
p.m. in the freshman quad there
is a pep rally for the lacrosse
team to get them rolling into
Wahoo game (and the Wahoos’
will be psyched). There’ll be
plenty of beer to keep the vocal
chords in tune, and a banner
contest (The winner gets a few
cases of beer). On Saturday, be
ready to scream and cheer the
whole game — never let them
down. If you see someone being
obnoxious, kindly ask him to
alter his style. The Cham-
pionship starts on Saturday —
Let’s do it!!!

Sincerely
Woody Wooddell ’77

e Dear Sir:
Letter s to the Editor I’ve seen three W&L lacrosse
games on Wilson Field this
. fi t .
Dear Sir: : But this potential end can be sadedtien in 1975, The Saha
The future of Washington and —_ avoided. We all love the team, about support for W&L lacrosse

still aren’t empty ones; the fans
are still rather vociferous, But
how can I convince the majority
of them that what they scream
during each game is boorish
and ignorant drivel?

I considered an appeal to
their pride in their knowledge of
the game. But after hearing the
bombardment of obscenities
that awaits any referee who
calls a non-flagrant foul on
W&L, I realized that most fans
don’t care how ignorant they
sound.

Next, I wondered if an
argument for sportsmanship
might help. I dropped that idea
like a double-knit sportcoat
after hearing a W&L staffer yell
taunts at the N. C. State bench
(while the Generals were being
eaten alive by one of the best
attackmen I’ve ever seen).

What else can I use as an
argument? Not much. I don’t
think anything will penetrate
the smug conviction in
Lexington that the fans are
what makes W&L lacrosse
successful. But the truth is that
while enthusiastic support
accompanies a winning team
(and complements it), crude
attempts at humor, ignorant
rantings, and drunken
screaming can harm the team’s
image much more than lack of
attendance can hurt it.
Washington and Lee fans come
off looking like jackasses, and
they can be thankful of several
things: 1) that Lexington is
remote enough that W&L must
schedule lots of backwater
teams who’ll take their punish-
ment and leave, 2) that players
on the field rarely hear in-
dividual voices from the stands
(the most idiotic chatter sounds
remarkable like cheering), and
3) that none of the fans listen to
what the others are yelling, so
nobody knows just how bad they
sound.

I’ll be interested to hear the
depths of bad taste and
childishness that are plumbed
at the Maryland game. See you
there.

number 1 position Ben Johns
registered a 3-3 record on the
road with wins over Georgia
Tech’s, University of Tampa’s,
and Eckerd’s top player.
Captain Ken Voelker also
posted a 3-3 record defeating the
University of Tampa’s,
Davidson’s, and Eckerd’s
number 3 singles player. The
three freshmen, number 4 Dee
Kesler, number 5 Richard
Makepeace, and number 6
David Constine posted a
disappointing 2-16 record
overall for the road trip at their
respective singles positions.
Coach Bussard expressed
some concern that the bottom
three freshmen have a “low
level of confidence,’’ because of
their several losses to ad-
mittedly far stronger op-
ponents. If Washington and Lee
is to have a .500 season or better
these freshmen will have to
improve on this won-loss record
against stronger opponents.
Coach Bussard hopes that the
match experience against the
tough opponents of the spring
break tour will show up toward
the end of the season when W&L
will again tackle, strong foes,
the likes of the Naval Academy
and the University of Virginia.
During the first week of the
spring semester the W&L
netters won three out of five
matches, On Monday William
and Mary toppled the Generals
for a 7-2 loss. One bright spot
was Ben John’s thrilling 7-6, 4-6,
6-4 victory over Marc Adams.
On Thursday and Friday the
W&L netters split two closely
contested matches with the
University of Richmond and Old
Dominion University. The
Generals edged Richmond 5-4,
but fell short by one match,
losing to O.D.U. by 4-5.
Finishing the week the W&L
netters traveled to Washington,
D. C. for two matches on
Saturday against George Mason
University in the morning and
Georgetown University in the
afternoon. Out of eighteen
matches played the Generals
captured sixteen defeating both
schools by an 8-1 margin.

Pub. Board
Results

(continued from page 1)

The Ring-tum Phi editorship
was the only election at the
March 21 meeting to stir any
controversy among members of
the Board. Bill Thomson,
president of the Board, read a
prepared statement prior to
that election accusing ‘“‘certain
members” of the Board of
engaging in questionable
political maneuvering prior to
the meeting. Steve Yevich
responded to the statement by
denying any such wrongdoing
on his part. Mr. Yevich, last
year’s Ring-tum Phi editor, has
since resigned from the Board.

W&L’s mentor, Buck Leslie was
deservedly named conference
Coach-of-the- Year.

Joining Leunig on the all-
conference squad were three
teammates — captain Jerry
Maatman, Gerry Barousse, and
Terry Sardrick. These four,
none of whom will be lost to
graduation, will form the
nucleus for nest year’s team, a
hopeful conference repeater.

Lieutenant Governor following
the death of J. Sargeant
Reynolds. Howell has gained
some notoriety for his attacks
on the sales tax and against
Vepco.

— Miller, on the other hand, is
considered as a moderate in his
approach to the issues. He has
served as the Attorney General
from 1969 to January, 1977;
when he resigned to pursue full
time the nomination. A native of
Abingdon, he is the son of

Francis Pickens Miller, who
was a foe of the old Byrd
machine.

— These debates have
become somewhat regular
throughout the Commonwealth
and according to Y. D. Chair-
man Ben Winn they are quite
exciting. The winner of the
primary to be held in June will
face the present Lieutenant
Governor and sole Republican
candidate John Dalton.
