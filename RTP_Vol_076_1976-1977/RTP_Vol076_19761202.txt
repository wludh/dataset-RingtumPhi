Charles Kuralt, Tom Wolfe,
Patrick Caddell and Vincent
Bugliosi head the list of speak-
ers for Contact ’77, according to
the co-chairmen of the commit-
tee.

Co-chairmen John Bruch and
Tom Murphy announced Tuesday
they are well underway in their
planning for this year’s Contact
program. According to Murphy,
Bugliosi and Kuralt have signed
contracts to appear this Winter
and a verbal agreement has been
reached with Caddell and Wolfe.

Three other speakers have been
contacted but have yet to sign any
contracts. Among them are a high
government official involved in
African affairs, a member of the
film industry, and a high rank-
ing officer of a major U.S. oil
company.

According to Murphy, it is un-
likely the goverfment official or
the oil company executive will
sign contracts prior to their ap-
pearance due to the nature of
their itineraries. But while their
appearance will remain in ques-
tion he does feel certain the other

_one will soon sign a contract.

Kuralt, who will speak on
March 22, is the CBS corrependent
who first conceived of the “On
the Road” series in 1967. When
the series first began it was in-
tended to be a short, three month
project.

The series was such a success
CBS continued it, and since that
time, Kuralt has logged many
hours “On the Road.”

A graduate of the University of
North Carolina, Kuralt began
writing for the “Charlotte News”
and was soon hired by CBS as
a newswriter. He advanced quick-
ly, moving first to Rio de Janeiro,
then to the West Coast and finally
to CBS News in New York.

Wolfe, a 1951 graduate of W&L,
served as editor of Shenandoah,
and The Southern Collegian as
well as sports editor of the Ring-
tum Phi. He was a member of
Phi Eta Sigma, the freshman
scholastic fraternity, and Phi
Kappa Sigma.

Aside from his writing for the
The Washington Post, the New
York Herald Tribune and New
York magazine, Wolfe has writ-

Parking problems

E.C. announces
unpleasant news

By REX NYQUIST

The decision was made, and
the decision stand§. There will
be no parking on either side of
the access road that runs in front
of the Woods Creeks Apartments,
Walt Kelley said at the E.C,
Meeting Monday night.

Kelley said the builders object
to the parking because it is “un-
aesthetic.” Assistant to the Presi-
dent Frank Parsons told him that
the administration has made the
decision and it will stand.

The University is considering
building a parking lot by the hea}
ing plant. However, it would not
be completed until next year at
the earliest. Parsons cited lack
of funds as the reason.

Rick Goddard, first-year Law
representative, asked if the E.C.
had undertaken an investigation
of the accident that resulted in
the injury of George Stadler dur-
ing a party at the SAE house.
Sandy Stradtman replied no, as
it was an accident and outside
of the E.C.’s jurisdiction. Stradt-
man is a member of SAE.

In other business, Jack Bovay
said the county sheriff's office is
going to start cracking down on
students who live outside of the
city and do not have county
stickers, and the E.C. appropri-
ated a $200 retainer for their
lawer last year, Tom Spencer.

By RICH LOVEGROVE

The students want convenient
parking facilities and in some
cases, just a parking space within
a few blocks of Woods Creek
Apartments.

The administration wants a
clutter free access road to the
law school and an overall aestheti-
eal layout for the apartment-law
school area.

So, while the school started
handing out parking tickets, some
of the students began tearing
down “No Parking” signs and
throwing bags of peat moss that
had been on the sidewalk for a
month down the hillside next, to
the West building.

The administration shot down
all hopes for irate Woods Creek
residents Monday when the Ex-
ecutive Committee was told that
there would be absolutely no
parking on the road leading to
the law school at any time.

Under the plan adopted for the
development of the law school-
apartment area, there was never
supposed to be any parking on the
road, according to Assistant to
the President Frank Parsons. The

Robert E. Huntley after consider-

Kolored Tangerine-Flake Stream-
line Baby and Radical Chic &
Mau-Mauing The Flak Catchers.

Wolfe has been called “super-
contemporary,” “parajournalistic”
and the “poet laureat of pop.” He
developed the “new journalism”
by incorporating a unique, irre-
verant jargon with a mixture of
metaphors.

This unique style emerged when
Wolfe was hurried to complete
an article for Esquire. He sat
down at his typewriter and simply
typed his notes which were print-
ed exactly as he typed them, in
what he calls the “wowie!”’ style.

Caddell has become one of the
most influential public opinion
researchers in the country. He
began his polling surveys while
still in high school and has since
conducted surveys for the Speaker
of the House of Represenatives in
Florida, Gov. John Gilligan of
Ohio, Sen, George MecGovern’s
presidential bid and President-
elect Jimmy Carter’s campaign.

Caddell is head of the Cam-
bridge Survey Research, Inc. and
was the youngest person included
in Time's 1974 list of 200 future
American leaders. He will speak
at W&L on Jan. 13.

Lewis Hall
of facilities

By J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER

Undergrad students from W&L
have been misusing the facilities
in the law school, according to
law school oflicials.

It seems as though some under-
grads find the law school much
quieter and more suitable to
studying than the facilities avail-
able to them on the front campus.
But instead of acting as guests
should, some law people believe
that the undergrads have practic-
ally claimed squatters’ rights in
the law school.

The offences range from “squat-
ting” in some law students’ per-
sonal study ecarrels to having a
pizza party in the faculty lounge.
When asked to refrain from such
behavior, the students in ques-
tion beeame rude and refused to
comply with the requests, ac-
cording to Assistant Librarian
Sally Wiant.

The undergrads are not being
harassed or treated unfairly just
because they are undergrads, The
law students are subject to the

Quick question: What constitutes a “minority” at Washington and

Lee?
a. blacks
b. women

c, anybody who doesn't own khakis and topsiders

d. almost everybody

Best answer, according to John X. Miller: d
And Miller’s in a position to know, He's the co-chairman of the
Minority Affairs Coordinating Committee—better known to the few

who have heard of it as the MACC

Founded last year, the MACC tries to represent anyone who feels
his (or her) opinions are in the minority at W&L. That's what Miller,

a senior from Winston-Salem, N.C.,

says

And along with Co-Chairman

Mickey Knapp, he is trying to commit the MACC to that goal.
PHIL: To start. could you please explain the purpose of the MACC”
MILLER: Basically, it's a committee composed of eight people.
Its purpose is to take minority attitudes and preferences from the

student body

from anybody who feels that his ideas are in the

minority. Then, we present these ideas to the power structure of the
student body, such as the Executive Committee or other committees,

such as Contact.
We're a sounding board

Before, a lot of people in the student

body felt they didn’t have much power because they didn't have any

input inte the committees

PHL Well, what caused the EC to create this committee? Did it
ereate the MACC out of the goodness of its heart or was it forced into

this action

MILLER: It wos set up last year because some of the black stu
dents felt that they didn’t have any input inte the decision-making
process about entertainment on campus

1 drew up the proposal for the committee origin ally, along with
Scott Franklin and a couple of other guys off the EC, The EC created

the committee last November

We pushed for it because we felt that minority opinions here on
the campus needed some way to be voiced
PHI: Then the MACC was created because of pressure from blacks

Does it primarily serve blacks?

MILLER: No. Actually, the things we've mainly done so far have

been for the female students

Now

the committee must include at

least four minority students, Right now, its composed of four blacks,

author of the best-seller Helter
Skelter, will appear at W&L on
Mareh 16.

Since the Manson trial in 1969,
Bugliosi has himself been the ob-
ject of much publicity. After put-
ting Manson and four co-defend-
ents behind bars, Bugliosi re-
peatedly warned the F.B.I. that
Manson cultist “Squeaky” Framme
was out to get President Ford.

He was also instrumental in hav-
ing the file on Robert Kennedy
assasination reopened on the basis
of new evidence which he felt
pointed to Sirhan Sirhan’s frame-
up and the existence of a second
assassin.

According to Brush, the remain-
ing speakers will be announced as
soon as they have signed con-
tracts.

University installs

new phone system

By LEE HOWARD

W&L’s operator-assisted switch-
board telephone system was re-
placed over the summer by a
computer-operated business phone
system with greatly increased ca-
pacities and a number of new
functions.

The new digital switch system
was recommended to the Uni-
versity by both CENTEL and
Executone, a private business
phone supplier, after the uni-
versity went to them with a prob-
lem: The completion of the new
law school necessitated a greater
extension capacity than the exist-
ing system would allow. School
officials agreed for the sake of

not have its own phone system,
so a new phone system was need-
ed. There was also the existing
problem of faculty members hav-
ing to share the same extension
number, as wella s the need for
more extension numbers when
the new library was completed.

The digital switch system, a
file-cabinet size solid-state mini-
computer was selected for its
greater extension capacity, for its
long-distance direct-dialing ca-
pacity, and for other conveni-
ence features.

The new system inereased the
school’s capacity from 293 ex-
tensions and 13 outside-line trunk

same rules that are being set down
for the undergrads. Food and
drink are not permitted in the
library. The classrooms and
seminar rooms are off limits to
everyone at night, and the Faculty
library and lounge is always off
limits to students.

According to Wiant, “Those
rooms aren’t used as study areas.
The law students aren't allowed
to use them, and they become per-
turbed when they find non-law
students using them.”

As for the carrels, each law
student has been assigned one.
Those that haven't been assigned
wil be used in some other ca-
pacity in the near future. In es-
sence, the carrels are altogether
off limits to the undergrads.

This does not mean that the
undergrads are not welcome. Law
school and library policy, as it
stands now, states the “Under-
graduates are permitted to use
the resource materials of the law
library, and work in the Main
Reading Room.”

Law librarian Peyton Neal said
that undergrads are welcome so
long as they obey the regulations.
He stressed the issue of the car-
rels, and said that smoking and
food were permitted only in the
designated areas (of which there
are none for undergrads). He also
said that at times the undergrads
could work in the reference area.

Some concern was expressed
about the upcoming exam period
and crowding in the law library,
but that problem will be shelved
until the crisis actually arises.

The Dean of the School of Law,
R. L. Steinheimer, said the under-
graduates were welcome if their
work and research were related
to law. If undergrad should use
their facilities he expects them to
“act responsibly” and follow the
same rules the law students do.

The law law school doesn’t want
to have to lay down rules on the
use of certain areas by under-
grads. and won't as long as the
students maintain a considerate
regard for them, he said.

a girl, a Jewish student, and two Caucasians. So it isn’t just a com:

mittee for black students.

Blacks already have their vocal organ in SABU (the Student As-
sociation for Black Unity), so what we're trying to do is give some-
body else some input into the decision-making process

PHI; Was the MACC created to really help the minorities? Or
was it just a way to get the blacks off the EC's back?

MILLER: It might have been a little bit of both. I think when the
EC created it, it really didn’t think much could be accomplished with
this committee. But the people on our committee this year think a

lot ean be done with it.

PHI: Does the EC listen to what the MACC says?

MILLER: We haven't taken anything to the EC yet this year. We're
still working on a couple of matters we started last year

We're working on a pamphlet for the exchange students here.
When they get here, they don’t have anything. So we're doing that

Also, we're getting into a few other things here on campus. We're
discussing them right now, but we haven't made any decisions yet

We're just trying to get some input

Our members have been

appointed to seven different student committees. So when Contact
brings a speaker here, at least those students who don't feel they have
a voice really will have a voice in that decision

PHI: How would you gauge the general student reaction to this

type of minority activism?

MILLER: Well, for example, a lot of the white students I've dealt

with feel the university
enough

doesn't accommodate

When a white student comes here

the black students
he has an easier time

Socially for blacks, there's no much to do. And I think some of the

whites sympathize with us

On the other hand, some students probably don't like having any
black students here and they probably came here because they didn't
think there would be many black students here

PHL So the MACC js off to a start. How does its future look?

MILLER: I'm thankful the EC created it, even if it Was Just seen

as a token effort

But I think the future depends on the students on the committee
If those students are willing to actively seek the feeling of those
students not actively involved in the power structure here and if
they get input into the committees, then it will work

But if that doesn't oceur, then the MACC will just exist to satisfy

the EC

Prospects

\nd so it begins. Systems fail. The sun grows dark, Chaos

creeps over the world. Rational men lose their wits and dash
madly about babbling incoherently. Babies ery. Dogs howl.

The moon ts blood red.

That's right,

frenzied activity :

brothers
reading twelve weeks worth

eCxXains are Upon us.

Two weeks of
of assignments

in four or five courses, writing term papers for perhaps as

many. All this and probably more (extracurricular activities-

Winter sports, Contact, editing a newspaper or two) while

trying to maybe sort of begin to perhaps start studying for

four of those three-hour mental torture sessions called exams.

Right.

Why is it, exactly, that the most grueling period of the term

invariably falls just before those all-important and most hol)

examinations? Term papers should not only be assigned at

the start of the term, they should be made due by the middle.

The workload of a given course should be lightest, not heaviest,

at the end so that proper preparations for exams can be made.

But this, of course, would go against tradition.

Somehow, though, we all seem to pull through this semi-
annual trial with little or no ill effects, Oh, there might be
a nervous breakdown or two along the way, perhaps a suicide,

and a few faces might be missing when we return in January.
No matter, Life, which at this point is mostly school, goes on.

There are, of course, consolations, depending on how far
in advance one is able to look at a time like this when the

immediate takes on such vast importance, In the almost fore-

sceable future lies the prospect of Christmas break, \lthough

somewhat shorter this year than usual, this vacation continues

to hold the promise of good times enjoyed with almost no

thought of college to dampen the spirits, Pity the student at

a school like Brown, where exams still come after the break.

Kinda take the

fun out of things, wouldn't it?

Then there's the Winter term. Terms are always great for

about three weeks when you can get a way with doing nothing

at all. But by the end of January we'll remember that the

faculty in ther infinite concern and generosity decided not to
vive us (and themselves) any sort of break during that long,

long term

\ll this means is that a few more classes than

usual will be missed (coincidently) during Mardi Gras, Faney
Dress always serves to brighten the horizon for a while, if

you don't mind spending a lot of money. And then come those

four term papers and exams again . .

. but let's not dwell on

future tragedies. For the day is sufficient unto itself and all

that.
\t any rate

with fear and trepidation bh

wdering on de

spair, we at the Ring-tum Phi offer our best wishes for su
cess during the coming onslaught, and hope that we may be

included in such a happy fate,

UT's Faustus innovative, powertul

By RICHARD S. WOLF

The University Theatre is pre-
senting the second play of its
season this week, Christopher
Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus. Will
Cantler, directing the play as his
senior drama thesis, has brought
the classic tragedy to the Troub
with a lively seript and some
of the best ensemble work to be
seen at W&L in years. The major
problem facing any producer of
Elizabethean drama is to avoid
letting the play drag. The present
production does a masterful job
of conquering this, but in doing
so has lost sight of some of the
more minor concerns. This alone
keeps Cantler’s production from
achieving excellence.

There are several aspects of the
production that are at first so
unique as to be disturbing. But
most of these resolve themselves
and prove to be quite effective.
The first surprise is to see Dan
Scott (of Richard Henry Lee fame)
in the title role. One usually en-
visions Faust as a wizened old
devil-worshiper and is understand-

Who’s Who
Dear Editor:

Having just read Mr. Meschutt’s
lelter eriticizing the candidates
for inelusion in Who’s Who in
American Colleges and Universi-
ties has prompted me to write
this.

It seems that-Mr. Meschutt be-
lieves the contributions made to
this University not of a totally
academic nature constitute medio-
crity and therefore deserve no
recognition.

Let me remind him that both
Phi Beta Kappa and Omicron
Delta Kappa are set aside to
recognize those who Mr. Meschutt
admires.

Who's Who does not require
that a student excell solely in
academia. All too often we hold
the ability to receive good grades
so high that we are not able to
laud the achievements made by
students in areas which constitute
leadership, stamina and dedica-
tion to purpose.

I believe the qualities that are
necessary to sueced in areas aside
from academia are worthy of
recognition. Those students seen
only behind library stacks are
perhaps more likely candidates
for Who's He?

Vandalism

Dear Ring-tum Phi:

Your editorial, “Privacy” in last
week's Phi, really hit the nail on
the head. Earlier in the year, I
wrote a letter regarding an inci-
dent in. whieh a ear was vand-
alized by a “townie.” Unfortun
ately, the article was taken to be
a critique of the parking facilities,
‘or lack of them) when in fact,
privacy was and is the point. Just
iwo days after the letter was pub

ably shocked to find him looking
like a sixteenth century version
of Tab Hunter. But it isn’t long
before Scott’s superb acting con-
vinees us that Faustus should look
this way. If one adjective could
be used to describe Scott's per-
formance, it would be powerful;
perhaps too powerful. He brings
to the role such emotion and yet,
at the same time control, that
most of the other charaeters seem
to wither in his presence.

This is particularly and unfor-
tunately true of Mephistophilis,
played by Emily Reid, a first year
law student. This messenger of
the Devil should be a pure per-
sonification of evil power and
diabolic intellect. Instead, Reid
gave us a smug smile and an
obnoxious laugh that could hardly
pass at satanic. She could not
convince us that she held the
power of Hell, and this in turn,
kept Faustus’ fall from being as
pathetic and frightening as it
should have been. At first glance
this problem may seem to be the
result of Mephistophilis being

lished, my winter coat was stolen.
No more than a week after that,
a C.B. radio antenna was taken
off an. auto. All these. incidents,
as well as those which are not
known to me, all support my be-
lief that a drastic change is called
for on our campus.

W&L is a private institution
and only those having legitimate
business on the campus should be
here. Why should we allow our-
selves to be taken advantage of?
There must be a solution which
will not deprive us of an open
campus. The stealing and vand-
alism we are being subjected to
must stop!

At Natural Bridge, Sandy
Stradiman presented to the class
of °80, a magnificent speech in
which we were told that acts of
erime are extinct at W&L. The
freshmen have been toid that they
should not be concerned for the
safety of their possesions when
left behind and to feel safe in
assuming that they may be found
the next day in the same spot
thev were left in. Well, the class
of ‘80 has been forced to learn
the hard way what a farce that
is! They have continually been
subjected to crime by those out-
side the W&L community.

The E.C. should get on the
ball and open their eyes to this
atrocity. When the problem is
realized in full, then maybe the
E.C. will act, if we raise enough
cain, then people may take notice.
Talk to your class rep. about the
matter and urge him to raise the
wtbject before the E.C. When we
have eliminated such outlandish
conduet by the W&L community
why should we put up with it
from outsiders? | am very upset
about this problem and I'm sure
vou agree, so let's join together
to check this problem before it
‘ets more out of hand!

NOTICES

As a service to Washington and
Lee students, the University has
once again this year engaged
Baldridge Reading and Study
Skills. Inc. te offer on campus a
special program designed to im
prove reading and learning skills
in academic subjects.

The program is not merely a
speed-reading course. Its techni
ques are designed to increase
reading speed, to strengthen com-
prehension, to improve recall, to

sustain concentration and to
deepen analysis. A student uses
his own classroom reading ma

terials rather than mass-prepared
instructional literature and me
chanical training aids

This program will be conducted
on the Washington and Lee cam
pus by an instructor from Bald
ridge Reading from January 10
through February 4. Scheduling
will be flexible to accommodate
individual student schedules, and
classes will be email to permit
necessary individual atention
Each student will attend a total
of twenty sessions, five per week
Tuition for the program will be
$75, payable by the start of the
program upon receipt of a state
ment from Baldridge

Further information and regi
stration cards may be obtained
from the Office of the Dean of
Students, Washington Hall 25
Interested students should regi

ster for the course as soon as

cast as a woman. But, though this
is an initial surprise, Reid did an
overall good job with the difficult
role and manged to efface her
gender. The basic problem in her
relationship with Faustus was
that she could not equal his level
of stage presence. Whether this is
her fault, or Seott’s for being too
powerful, I am not sure, but I
think the former.

A masterful stroke of Cantler’s
was to have some 33 terciary roles
played by a company of eight
actors. This resulted in some fine
character portrayals, particularly
by Brad Liston and Hugh Sisson.

This production marks the
debut of the Drama Departments
new set and technical designer,
Tom Ziegler. If the set for Faustus
is any indication of the work

_ that the

that Ziegler usually does, some-
one should give this man tenure
before he escapes. This is the
most original and successful set
Troub has housed for
some time. It is a multi-tiered
affair with a run-way down the
length of the theatre, upon which
there was some effective staging.
Ziegler is also responsible for the
mavelous posters for the play.

Overall, this production of
Doctor Faustus is a very suc-
cessful one. Besides the major
problem of an imbalance between
Faustus and Mephistophilis, the
play was excellent. With the Uni-
versity Theatre having now pre-
sented two very well done plays,
I anxiously await Who‘’s Afraid of
Virginia Woolf, to be offered next
semester.

 

Charles Porterfield Light, Jr.

 

Charles Porterfield Light Jr.,
a teacher for 47 years in the
School of Law and its dean for
eight, died Nov. 19 following
a long illness. He was 73.

Dean Light was one of
W&L’s legendary figures, and
his influence reached to the
highest levels of the legal pro-
fession. When he retired from
teaching in 1973,-he received
accolades from Chief Justice
Warren E. Burger and from
Supreme Court Justice Lewis
F. Powell Jr., whom Dean Light
had taught at Washington and
Lee.

His principal fields of teach-
ing were constitutional and ad-
ministrative law and _ torts.
More than 100 of his alumni—
“the Light brigade”—currently
hold federal judgeships. Two
of his students were elected
presidents of the American Bar
Association, Mr, Powell and the
late Ross L. Malone. Many of
America’s largest corporations
have Dean Light's graduates as
their general counsel.

Ile was born Dee. 29, 1902,
in Martinsburg, W.Va., the son
of the late Charles Porterfield
and Margaret Harlan Light, He
was a 1923 graduate of Virginia
Military Institute and earned
his law degree in 1926 from
Harvard University. He join-
ed the W&L law faculty in that
year. In 1928, V.M.1. awarded

 

Dean Light dies at 73

him an M.A. degree for post-
graduate work in _ political
science.

He became dean of the W&L
law school in 1960. He firs!
stepped down from that post
in 1967, when he reached 65,
the mandatory retirement age
for administrators, and re-
sumed fulldime teaching.

But his retirement from the
deanship turned out to be
short-lived. He had been suc-
ceeded by Robert E. R. Huntley

who also had studied under
Dean Light—but less than a
year later, Huntley was elect-
ed W&L president, and. Dean
Light was called back into ser-
vice as law dean until a perma-
nent suceessor could be named.

President Huntley comment-
ed: “Dean Light’s death is an
incalculable loss to me_per-
sonally, and to his other col
leagues and alumni and
friends. And it is that kind of
loss not only to Washington
and Lee, but also to the legal
profession he served so long
and in so many exemplary
ways

“I was his student and fae-
ulty colleague: he was my dean,
and a short while | was even
his dean. And most important
of all, he was my friend, a
friendship I have always trea-
sured deeply—and which | will
remember warmly, and miss so
much.”

Generals look for NCAA berth

This year’s Washington and Lee
basketball team has two primary
goals to attain. The first is to
win twenty games, and the sec-
ond is to receive a bid to the
NCAA Division Il national
championship playoffs. These are
difficult but very attainable goal’s
for this year’s team. If they don’t
reach them it will have to be
considered a disappointing season.

Two years ago the Generals had
a 15-12 record but lost all but
a few of the games in the second
half of the season. They received
a surprising but not very well
deserved bid to the NCAA play-
offs. Last year’s team, with a 19-7
record, a VCAA_ championship,
and the coach and player of the
year in the state of Virginia, did
not receive a bid. It was a bitter
disappointment to the players.
They very much deserved a bid,
and would have received one if
the regional selection committee
had not been overruled by the
national office. This year’s team
wants the bid they missed last
year and they want it badly. They
will strive to prove beyond a

doubt that they cannot be over-
looked by the NCAA at the end
of the year.

The situation is somewhat dif-
ferent this season in that W&L
is now a member of the Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference. By
winning the conference champion-
ship the Generals can receive an
automatic bid to the Division II
Southwest Regional Tournament.
The competition wil Ibe tough,
however, particularly from Lynch-
burg and Hampden-Sydney, both
of whom return most of their
players from last year’s teams.
Bridgewater, Eastern Menonite,
and Emory and Henry round out
the league. The top four teams,
based on regular season record,
will play in the ODAC champion-
ship tournament on Feb. 25. and
26 in Doremus.

Coach Canfield’s co-captains
this year are Bob Flint and Kim
Sims. Both lead through setting
examples of steadiness and hard
work. Flint started the entire
season last year at the strong
forward position, and was the
team’s leading rebounder. He is
particularly quick near the basket.
Sims started many games last year
as well as the year before. He has
always been an excellent de-
fensive player and has recently
developed a fine long-range jup
shot. Both players will fill promi-
nent roles in the Generals’ pro-
gress as the season develops.

One of Coach Canfield’s trade-
marks throughout the years has
been to consistently play ten men
in every game. The result has
been that he has a strong bench,
and is two or more deep with
solid ball players at every posi-
tion. This year’s Generals are no
exception in this respect.

At the point guard position, in
addition to Sims, he has Mike
Wenke and Bob Forlenza. All
three have extensive playing ex-
perience, and all three are small,
quick, and excellent defensive
players and ball handlers. There
are differences, however. Wenke
is a motor mouth and loves to
drive to the basket. Forlenza,

coming back from an off-season
shoulder operation, is more
effective as an outside shooter.

The shooting guard position is
held down primarily by Pat
Dennis, He sat on the bench last
year behind All-American John
Podgajny and this year he’s
hungry to show what he can do.
He has a very quick outside
jumper which very few teams will
be able to stop. In addition, he’s
an excellent rebounder. He'll be
backed by junior newcomer Ea-
man Cassell. Though only 511”,
Cassell is a strong jumper and a
good defensive player. He passed
up football this year in order to
play basketball and he should
make a valuable contribution to
the team.

The forward position may be
the strongest on the team. Man-
ning it are Dave Leumig and
Chris Larson, and both are fine
ball players. Leunig is more
steady while Larson is more
spectacular. Leunig has has all
the sound fundamentals neces-
sary to the position. He’s aggres-
sive, he rebounds and he has an
effective medium range shooting
touch. Larson has the potential
to score twenty or more points
in any given game. He has a
very soft outside shot as well as
quick driving moves to the basket.
The most overlooked strength in
his game is his uncanny ability
to hit the open man inside with
a sharp pass.

This year’s team has three cen-
ters. Six-foot-nine, two hundred
and thirty pound Don Berlin is
returning for his fourth year of
varsity action. He’s not very fast
getting up and down the court
but he’s quick and strong near the
basket. Sophomore Ardith Collins
is a strong defensive player and
shot rejector, and has an effective

‘turnaround jumper. Senior Steve

Hand is returning to the Generals
after two years off and will pro-
vide valuable team leadership
both on the court and off. His
array of hook shots is very dif-
ficult to stop.

Jim Berlin, Don’s brother, will

ward position this year. He’s a

playing strong forward, as well as

Swimming
The W&L swimming Generals
won an exhibition dual meet with
the Briarwood A.A.A.U. Club of
Richmond, 72-23, and _ finished
fourth out of ten teams in the
Millersville Relays Nov. 13.

The highlight of both meets
was the fact that senior co-captain
Tad Van Leer, and W&L’s 800
free relay team composed of Van
Leer, Chip Hoke, Keith Romich,
and co-captain John Hudson,
qualified for the National Champ-
ionships based on their times in
the meets. Van Leer also qualified
in the 50 yard freestyle. W&L
came up with some excellent
early season times that had head
coach Bill Stearns smiling.

Individual winners against the
Briarwood Club ineluded Drew
Pillsbury in the 200 individual
medley, the 200 backstroke, and
the medley relay, Romich in the
200 free and the 200 butterfly,
Van Leer in the 50 free and med-
ley relay, Hudson in the 500 free,
Seott Duff in the 100 free and
medley relay, and Peter Meem in
the 200 breaststroke and medley
relay.

W&L finished fourth in the
Millersville Meet behind East
Stroudsburg, Glassboro State, and
Bloomsburg State. The 400 yard
butterby relay team of Duff, Van
Leer, Romich and Hudson cap-
tured the Generals’ only first place
award.

Wrestling

The W&L grapplers are aiming
to make 1976-77 their third con-
secutive winning season. The Gen-
erals finished at 8-7 in dual meet
competition last season, and third
place in the Virginia College
Athletic Association. The team is
a member of the first year Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
this season, along with Eastern
Mennonite, Hampden-Sydney, and
Lynchbourg College.

Coach Gary Franke sets as the
teams’ '76-77 goals that of another
winning season, and to bring the
first O.D.A.C. wrestling title to
Lexington. The Generals have 12
dual meets scheduled this year,
as well as six tournament appear-

ances. The coach cites Duke,
George Mason, Colgate, and cros-
town rival V.M.I. as the most
challenging non-conference op-
ponents, and Lynchburg as the
most difficult team in the O.D.
A.C, Included in the six tourneys
are the W&L Invitational, the
Citadel Tournament in Charles-
ton, S.C., and the Pembroke State
Invitational in Pembroke, N.C.

The Generals lost 126 lb. Lee
Keck and 167 lb. Rich Heldrick
to graduation. The returnees are
led by captain Jim Crytzer at 158
Ib., Kevin McFadden at 167 Ib.,
and Dan Kniffen in the heavy-
weight class. Freshmen who could
make major contributions in their
first season include Boyd Breed-
ing at 118, Ray Gross at 142, and
Todd Wohler at 167.

The ’76-77 Generals are think-
ing optimisitically about the
O.D.A.C. crown, as well as hoping
for a strong showing in the N.C.
A.A. Division III Championships
to be held at the State Uni-
versity of New York at Bingham-
ton on March 3-5.

Soccer

Junior Mark Derbyshire and
Mark Bennett have been named
the co-captains elect of the 1977
soecer Generals. Derbyshire, also
a captain this past season, is a
halfback from Baltimore, and also
plays lacrosse at W&L.

Bennett is a goalkeeper from
Neptune City, New Jersey, and is
the school record holder for most
saves in one game, one season,
and in a career. The 1976 soccer
Generals recently completed their
season with a 3-10 mark.

Under the direction of Coach
Rolf Piranian, W&L is conducting
an indoor soccer program during
the winter months. The team mem-
bers have been split into four
groups and wil leompete for the
W&L indor soccer championship.

New phone system is more efficient Woods Creek: no parking

(Continued from Page 1)
cables to 350 extensions and 21
outside lines.

The new system’s direct dial
capabilities was a compelling fea-
ture. Under the old system, all
long-distance calls had to be
operator-assisted, which cost the
university extra money. But there
have been problems with the new
direct-dialing feature. The uni-
versity did not want everyone to
have the direct dialing option for
fear of abuse. It was more difficult
than either the phone company or
the university imagined to limit
the direct dialing capabilities to
certain phones. As it stands now
the operator has to make out slips

for every long-distance call that is
made.

Some of the convenience fea-
tures of the new phone system
include:

Camp-On: If you dial a busy
number within the university,
dialing 1 tells the person you are

trying to reach that he has
another call.
Automatic Callback: If you

reach a busy number, dialing 2
tells the computer to call you
back as soon as the other person
is off the phone. When you an-
swer, the computer automatically
rings the number you were try-
ing to reach.

A new record album featuring
the W&L Glee Club performing
songs about W&L has just been
released.

In addition to a number of
W&L standards, including “The
W&L Swing” and “Fight, Fight,
Blue and White,” the album con-
tains the premiere performance
of a new music-and-narrative
composition about W&L’s 227-
year history, “This Good Land
For Our Heritage.”

In addition to the Glee Club
songs, the album also contains
two numbers—“The Swing” and
“Fight, Fight,” W&L’s most fam-
ous “fight” songs—played on the
piano by Mrs. Frederick M. P.
Pearse. Mrs. Pearse’s renditions
of the two songs have become ex-

where she works as a hostess and
where the album was recorded.

Four of the songs were written
by the late John A. Graham, a
W&L teacher from 1919 until his
death in 1947—“Fight, Fight”:
“Hold ’Em, Gen'rals”; “Onward
For Alma Mater” and “The Only
Girl.” Graham was director of the
W&L theatre and glee club for
many years.

The album is available from
the University Record Store (in
the same building as the Book-
store between the old freshman
dormitories and McCormick Li-
brary). The cost is $5, which in-
cludes sales tax.

line, in an emergency situation
she may cut into somebody’s con-
versation.

Consultation Hold: Allows you
to keep a person on hold while
you are consulting with someone
else. There have been problems
with this holding technique be-
cause you cannot hold the cradle
button down for more than 1%
seconds, or less than % second.

Transferring calls: You may
transfer calls from one person to
another by putting a person on
hold, then dialing another per-
son’s number and hanging up.

Call Forwarding: Allows a per-
son to forward a call to another
number automatically.

The contract to install the new
phone system was given to CEN-
TEL rather than Executone be-
cause the initial capital outlay
for equipment was too great for
the university to afford if they
had to buy the equipment. CEN-
TEL charges a monthly rental fee
for the equipment and also pro-
vides better maintainance.

However they were not very
helpful in training the people
who had to use the phones. Terry
Atwood has filled that gap by
teaching class every day on the
use of the new equipment. He
also serves as W&L’s liaison with
the phone company.

The new system costs $700 more
per month; $3000 per month vs.
$2300 for the old system. Mosi
people believe it’s worth it.

ing several plans, called for
aesthetic development of the
area, Parsons said.

The administration wanted a
two-way access road to the law
school, one that would be free
from the clutter of parked cars,
Parsons said. They also felt that
they could not provide enough
parking spaces that would meet

‘safety standards to justify the

cost, accordin gto Parsons.

Both Parsons and Dean John
agree that much of the student
animosity stems from allowing
students to park along the road
and across from the apartments
last year and part of this year and
then changing to a no parking
policy.

Parking was allowed last year,
becatise the administration felt
the students would compain about
not being able to park in an un-
used area, Parsons said, refering
to a strip of land across from
Woods Creek that was dirt last
year but is now filled with bould-
ers and trees.

Students were also allowed to
park on the road much of this
year. But after the road was
paved the administration began
handing out tickets.

Most Woods Creek dwellers are
unhappy with the situation. Many
enjoyed the convenience of park-
ing in front of the apartments,
while some simply cannot find a
parking place behind the gym dur-
ing week days.

But most are upset because they
feel the administration ignored
student opinions in making their
decision.

One student said he is annoyed
with the way the administration
used the available space. He said
he particularly dislikes the use
of large boulders where there
could have been parking. His
sentiments have been echoed by
many students who. live in Woods
Creek and feel that the money
used for landscaping could have
complete it quickly this fall.

to finish the job this summer to are justified. They said they do

provided parking.

Parsons said he was unable to
isolate the cost of moving the
rocks and dirt from the total cost
of the law school project but he
estimated that the planting of
trees cost approximately $34,000.

Several students have complain-
ed about the slow pace at which
the construction has been com-
pleted. One senior said he was
annoyed that the work was not
done during the summer. Others
said they thought three months
was too long to pave a road, lay
a sidewalk, move in dirt and
boulders and plant trees. Accord-
ing to Parsons the contractor was
unable to get the people necessary

Parsons and John said they do
not think most student complaints

not consider the walk from the
gym parking lot to the apartments
too long, particularly compared to
the distance students at other
schools are required to walk. John
also said he thinks there is gen-
erally enough room to park in
the gym lot.

Parsons and John both said
that the current parking situation
is not permanent but emphasized
that parking will never be allow-
ed on the access road. More
parking areas will be studied
“when construction and finances
allow,” said John.

Meanwhile Woods Creek resi-
dents will have to get used to
walking from the gym to their
apartments and occasionally shell-
ing out money for parking tickets.
