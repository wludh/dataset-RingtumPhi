300 To Graduate
Thursday Morning

by Heartsill Ragon

For the 227th time since
W&L’s opening, graduating
seniors will make one of their
final walks down the column-
lined front campus. However,
this walk will not be a worried
rush to a test or a class but
instead, will be a leisurely stroll
to the diploma line.

W&L’s graduation
ceremonies will be _ held
Thursday May 26 at 11 a.m. on
the front campus, weather
permitting. Over 300 seniors
will be presented’ with
bachelor’s degrees while 71 law
degrees will be presented to
graduating law students.

The commencement
ceremony itself will feature
speeches by W&L President
Robert E. R. Huntley and
student body President Thomas
H. Hunter.

Preceding the formal
graduation ceremonies, retired

Army .General Bruce C. Clark
will be the principle speaker at
ceremonies honoring the
student members of the W&L
Reserve Officer Training
Corps. The commissioning of
these officers will take place in
Lee Chapel and will begin at 9
a.m.

Graduation activities for-
mally begin Wednesday when
the traditional baccalaureate
service will be conducted. The
11 a.m. ceremony will be held in
Evans Dining Hall and will be
directed by Dr. David W.
Sprunt, university chaplain and
professor of religion.

The President and Mrs.
Huntley’s traditional luncheon
and reception will cap the
graduation activities. Both the
luncheon, sponsored by the
W&L Alumni Association, and
the reception are open to

Annual RtP Awards;
Noell, Print Shop Honored

by Robert D. Lutz

Associate Dean of Students
William A. Noell and the entire
staff of the Washington and Lee
Journalism Laboratory Press
(commonly called the ‘Print
Shop’) have been chosen as
recipients of the 1977 Ring-tum
Phi Awards for distinguished
service to the W&L University
community.

Dean Noell is leaving W&L
after seven years of service in
various administrative
positions in order to accept a
post.at the University of
Virginia. Students during those
years often came to identify
Dean Noell with W&L itself;
during those years he has
handled every conceivable sort
of student ‘‘crisis’’. And still he
seems sane. This marks the
second time in his career that
Dean Noell has_ inexplicably
transformed himself from a
W&L gentleman into a
“Wahoo.”

Collective recipients of the
second Award are:

business manager and general
den mother, whose lot in life
consists of administering the
various Pring Shop operations,
keeping records, ordering
supplies, dealing with various
irate administrators who never

family and guests.
E. T. Walker, production

manager, who manages to
make sure that everything gets
finished more or less on time.
What’s amazing is that Ed this
without ever raising his voice or
becoming violent; if you knew
what he has to put up with,
you’d know what a feat that is.
And no matter how busy he is,
Ed somehow always finds time
to do a favor for anyone who
asks, even if it means using both
hands and both feet to run four
machines at once.

Don Tabbut, offset press
operator and master of the
Shop’s finest piece of equip-
ment, the Heildelberg press.
Don is a mellowing influence in
a shop full of volatile crazies,
dangerous only when he’s
dealing the cards.

Hunter McCoy, typesetter
and professional sourpuss.
Beneath that cynical, abrasive,
and sometimes nasty exterior
there lies a heart of gold. The
only problem is finding it.

‘‘Light-fingers’’ Larry
Mason, linocomp operator. If he
ever takes a swing at you,
you’re probably dead. Chances
are it won’t happen, though;
he’ll bend over backwards to
help you. The only thing Larry’s
likely to destroy in the near
future is that damned linocomp.

To Number
350

Washington and Lee will have
an entering freshman class of
about 350 students, according to
admissions director James D.
Farrar.

That is back to what
university officials consider the
optimum entering freshman
class size after this year’s 402
freshmen.

Farrar said last year’s class
was the result of an un-
precendented yield in the ad-
missions process.

Better than 50 per cent of the
791 high school students offered
admission for the 1976-77

President Robert Huntley
was the official starter of the
race that began at the County
Courthouse on Main Street in
Lexington. From there the
runners traveled along Rt. 11
until turning towards Bean’s

Bottom to the first refreshment
stand. After a series of long
climbs on dusty roads, the
halfway point and another
refreshment point were
reached. The twisting route
then back-tracked and went
behind the campus of V.M.I. up
to the finish lap at Wilson Field.
The expressions on the runner’s
faces at the last checkpoint and
the finish line tell a story in
themselves.

and organizer of the mini-

as a matter of pride and not
necessarily to win. Some of that

Students Investigate
Land Fraud In Va.

The three reporters quizzed
the lawyer for two hours about
certain associates of his, and
their business activities. He
gave them the information they
desired, but not overly
willingly.

They had come in playing
dumb, acting like they didn’t
know much about what they
were asking. But as the con-
versation progressed, it became
apparent to the lawyer he had
underestimated them. For

photo by H. Ragon

every answer he gave, the
reporters came back with
another question. ‘‘Well, wasn’t
it really like this...’”’ ‘We heard
from someone else it happened
this way...”

Slowly but surely the
threesome exhausted every
loose end they could think of,
except one. They were saving
that for last, because they knew
asking about it could suddenly
end the interview.

Then, finally, with no place
left to go, they struck home and
asked the lawyer about himself.
The mood of the interview
changed drastically. The
lawyer took his feet down off his
desk and sat forward in his
chair. He tore off a small piece
of paper and started chewing on
it. He handled the questions
about his suspension from the
bar 19 years. before with
guarded caution. When the
subject shifted to his 11-year
hiatus in Florida, he became
even more nervous and started
doodling on the pad before him.

said. “‘What did you do?’’ Sold

department has accepted 30
fewer students. Of the 1,320
applicants this year 762 have
been accepted Farrar said.

Of those accepted, Farrar
expects approximately 47 to 48
per cent to enter the class.

At this point, 357 students
have confirmed their ac-
ceptance. Twenty-five of these
were early decision students
and five are students who
deferred admission from last
year.

This year’s class is expected
to be of a higher academic
quality than some in the past,
Farrar added.

“SAT’s are up, and for the
first time W&L was able to offer
honor scholarships” he said.

That enables W&L to attract
better students who might have
gone somewhere else because
they would receive a_ better
financial deal, he said.

The university offers Robert
E. Lee scholarships, which are
a total grant, National Merit
scholarships, which pay the
student a _ fixed sum,
Washington Honor scholar-
ships, which are offered to in-
state students and Gaines
Honor scholarships, which go to
out-of-state students.

W&L offered these honor
awards to 59 incoming fresh-
men. Twenty-eight of those
students will come to W&L next
fall.

Of the students offered the
grants, those refusing are going
to attend schools with which
W&L has long felt in com-
petition. Four students will go to
Dartmouth, three to Harvard
and Davidson, and one to Yale
and Princeton. Six will go to the
University of Virginia.

Dewing, Ruscio

To Stay At School

by Rex Nyquist

Douglass Dewing, a senior
from Portsmouth, Virginia, has
been named to a newly-created
position, assistant director of
publications at Washington and
Lee. Dewing, who will receive
his B. A. degree in journalism
next week, will assist R. T.
Weatherman, director of
publications, and will work
closely with the news operation.

He will inaugurate a program
under which a new graduate
will be appointed to work for
one year in the university’s
publications program. The
program is modeled after one in
the admissions office which has
been in successful operation for
eight years.

Dewing has worked as a
student assistant in the news
office for two years, and has
written occasional articles for
the alumni magazine. In ad-
dition, he has served as a
reporter for the Ring-tum Phi
and has worked at WLUR.

Also, Ken Ruscio has been
rehired as Assistant Director of
Admissions and Assistant Dean
of Students. Ruscio travels
extensively to represent the
university at secondary schools,
interviews applicants, and
assists in the Admissions and
Dean of Students offices. He has
also worked actively with the
Student Recruitment Com-
mittee this year. A_ 1976
graduate of W&L, he will serve
in his post until June, 1978.

Survey Reveals

Dope Smoking Habits

Fifty-four per cent of the
freshman class have tried
marijuana or are currently
using it, according to a survey
of 65 per cent of the class con-
ducted by Mike Mrlik. Forty-six
per cent of the class have never
tried the drug.

Mrlik’s survey was given out
to all 387 freshmen. Two hun-
dred and fifty three freshmen
responded to the survey. Mrlik
broke down the statistics fur-
ther to indicate the difference
between fraternity and in-
dependent users, the
relationship between GPA and
frequency of use and the
relationship between use of
marijuana and attitudes toward
the drug.

Mrlik found that 64.7 per cent
of fraternity members have
tried marijuana versus only
about 47 per cent for in-
dependents. Only 59 out of 167
fraternity members have never
tried marijuana, according to
Mrlik’s survey. Out of the 72
independents answering the
survey 34 said they had tried the
drug.

In relating frequency of
marijuana use to GPA. Mrlik
found that students between 1.0
and 2.0 are the most likely to be
regular and occasional users.
Seventy-two per cent of these
students are occasional users.
Freshmen between 0.0 and 1.0
were the second-most likely to
use the drug. Of the three
student listing themselves in
this ignominious category, two
listed themselves as occasional
users. Students with GPAs
between 2.0 and 3.0 were the
next most likely to use
marijuana. Forty-four per cent
of these students are either
regular or occasional users,
according to the survey. The
studious 3.0 to 4.0 students are
the least likely to use
marijuana. Only 40 per cent use
the drug, according to the
study.

The survey also found that
only 12.2 per cent of marijuana
users believe marijuna leads to
harder drugs, while 45.2 per
cent of non-users believe
marijuana leads to other drugs.

you work for?’’ He reeled off the
names of three companies.
“Okay, now let’s go back to
where you lived for just a
moment. Could you give us, say,
a specific address?”’ This was
the crucial question. The
reporters had tried to locate a
record of his residence in the
Orlando area, but had turned up
nothing. If he’d actually been
there and had been clean, they
reasoned, he’d have no ob-
jection to answering the
question.

Three...two...one...explosion!
Suddenly the lawyer was on his
feet, ranting and raving about a
“smear,” threatening to sue the
three if they ever put his name
in print, and screaming for
them to get out at once!

The incident took place in the
southwestern Virginia city of
Abingdon, the lawyer’s name
was William P. Sheffield, and
the three reporters were Gary
Collier, Neal Cory and Brad
Elliott, students in Prof. Clark
Mollenhoff’s Advanced In-
vestigative Reporting class
(Journalism 387).

Seventeen juniors and seniors
are enrolled in ‘‘Super Snoop
and Scoop,” as the course has
been called. From Mollenhoff, a
1958 Pulitzer Prize winner
acknowledged as one of the
country‘s best investigative
reporters, they have been
learning the “tricks of the
trade’ — how to dig through
obscure public records to find
information, how to get a
reluctant source to talk, what to
look for and where to look for it.

What is more fortunate is that
the class has had the op-
portunity to actually practice
what they’ve been taught.

During the winter, Mollenhoff
talked to local Commonwealth’s
Attorney John Read in hopes of
designing a suitable project for
the class to tackle. Read put
them onto what appeared at
that time to be a possible land

fraud case in Rockbridge
County. It involved three
principals-entrepreneur Robert
E. Bales of Glade Springs,
realtor Hugh Rakes of Salem,
an J. Edwin Berry of Staunton.

The class was divided into
teams to research different
facets of the case. One team, led
by Collier, was given the job of
running down Bales’
background. That team in-
cluded Elliott, Cory, Rick
Lovegrove, and Doug Jackson.
Steve Dibaggio, John Kingston
and Ed Hancock investigated
Hugh Rakes. Bill Edmisten,
Frank Turner, Bob Rathbun
and Heartsill Ragon tackled J.
Edwin Berry. Handling the
situation in Rockbridge County
were Mike Ferrara, Bill
Thompson, Chris Larson, Ed
Burgess and Galen Trussell.
Jay Taylor researched data at
the State Corporation Com-
mission office in Richmond.
Rob DiSilvestre was charged
with supervising the con-
struction of the final articles.

E. C. Finds Itself
Short Of Funds

In what Paul Larkin
described as a ‘‘very low key
meeting,’’ the Executive
Committee wound up the school
year Monday by trying to
balance the books.

Sandy Stradtman, E. C. vice
president, announced that the
E. C. is $2,200 short of projected
funds. The major reason for this
has been “attrition,” Stradt-
man said. A lot of people have
left school.

The student body fund was
originally supposed to be $68,00
for 1,700 persons, Stradtman
said. The money comes from
the student activity fee of $20
per student every semester
except the Spring Semester.
Stradtman said the deficit
might have to be made up by
using the Student Body Reserve
Fund money. However there is
still $3,200 in accounts
receivable that should be
coming in. But $2,100 of that
money is money loaned to the
Student Activities Board, and
only about half of that money is
expected back.

Right now there is about
$4,800 left in the Student Body
Reserve Fund, Stradtman said,
but there is at least $1,100 in
accounts receivable. The
reserve fund started the year
with about $6,700, said Stradt-
man, meaning at worst the fund
will have lost about $800 over
the year. The reserve fund is
used for bailing out
organizations that get into
monetary difficulties.

Members of the committee
said they expect $300 back from
the Cold Check Committee, plus
some of the $700 that they gave
to Ariel. The SAB and the Ring-

tum Phi were also mentioned as
possible sources of returned
funds. It appears that the new
E. C. will have to take care of
the monetary problems,
because some organizations,
such as the SAB, will not know
their financial situation until
sometime in the summer.

While Stradtman was closing
the books on this year’s E. C.
monetarily, Radar Davis closed
the books on the E. C.’s
legislative year. He announced
that no amendments to the
constitution passed this year
because all fell about 150 votes
short of the requirement that
for an amendment to pass at
least 50 per cent of the student
body must vote. Some amend-
ments received the required
two-thirds majority but none
received the required 800 votes,
said Davis.

In other action, the E. C.
voted 6-2 to provide the Ring-
tum Phi with honor violation
statistics. The E. C. also an-
nounced that the Mock Con-
vention has made out its final
report and had sent a copy to
the Sumner Foundation, an
organization which last year
contributed about $20,000 to the
Mock Convention. Jim McNider
and Dave Myer, the new MW. C.
co-chairmen, are hoping for
continued support from the
Foundation.

NOTICE
Eight private honor trials
were conducted by the
Executive Committee this year,
resulting in 3 convictions. Two
sophomores and one junior
were expelled from school.

Salesman Cast Effective

 

A RING-TUM PHI
INTERVIEW

 

 

by Robert B. Ramirez

Death of a Salesman is a play
that makes you unsure of
whether you’re proud or
ashamed that you’re an
American — whether you’re
glad or resentful: of the fact.
From the beginning of the play,
from the moment the Salesman
trudges wearily into his house,
sets down his bags, sighs, and
looks around him, we become
aware that something
paradoxical is about to take
place: it will be an event both

familiar and uncommon,
Shatteringly said yet full of
ultimate solace. In the

Troubadour production of the
play, this mood is announced by
the exhausted look on the face of
Warren Mowry, playing the
Salesman, and by the sad,
tender music composed by June
Morgan. The moment turned
out to be a simple, human one,
and promised many more later.

John Hollinger’s thesis
production of Death of a
Salesman is a tightly-directed
piece of ensemble acting. It did
seem to be the case, however,
that the cast was suffering from

KNOWS

Have we got real hard-core
investigative news for you
today. It has come to our at-
tention that there are some
members of the Executive
Committee who voted against
using student funds to throw
their year-end bash, but who did
so because it looked good and
they knew it would lose.

Senior rep Paul Larkin is the
one culprit who seems to be
most guilty of this. In fact, he
had done it before. At Fancy
Dress, Larkin argued long and
hard for the SAB party, to

under-rehearsal. This is a
common offense of college

productions, especially un-

derstandable in light of the
demands on the members of the
Total Theatre company. It took
a whole act for the cast to catch
the spirit of the show, to get
away from the attitude that it
was something to be gotten
through, to relax into the script
and see that it was a place to
just be. Especially in the first
act, the pace speeded up and
slowed down again, bouncing
between extremes, trying to
find its proper level. Salesman
is a script to be savored and
tasted a bit at a time, not to be
rushed through. It’s one of the
tightest, most thoughtful pieces
of writing on the market; every
line means so much; there’s no
fat or repetitiveness. Since this
is the case, the energy level
should be high but not rushed. It
should take place at the pace of
the normal American speech of
normal Americans who are not
at all sure about themselves or
the world in which they’re
trying to make their way.

In a sense, making one’s way
is a preoccupation of this play.
Willy Loman, who thinks no
career could be more satisfying
or attractive than selling, was
played by Mowry as a confused,

angry salesman, a_ per-
sonification of, the con-
tradiction and waste and half-
baked-ness that are a part of
our lives. Betty Kahn was
Linda: suffering, patient,
careworn, resigned. In her last
appearance on the Boilerroom
stage, she was Sonia in Uncle
Vanya — in many ways the
same character. It’s a pity we
didn’t see her in other shows
this year, to see whether or not
that is the only part she does
well. Listening to that mourn-
ful, almost plaintive voice,
down in the Old Boilerroom
theatre, I did find myself with a
bad case of theatrical deja vu.

Perhaps the best job of
casting I’ve seen in a long time
was Ty York and Rich Allen as
Biff and Happy. Both these men
looked perfect for their parts,
and performed better than
many far more experienced
actors I’ve seen, here and
elsewhere. One disappointment
was that Mr. Allen did have a
habit of speaking his lines more
from rote than from sympathy.
Sometimes this worked, giving
the impression of happy-go-
lucky (no pun intended) non-
chalance, but at other times it
ended up merely spoiling the
fascinating attractiveness of
what was being said.

A RING-TUM PHI

 

 

INTERVIEW

 

 

by Jay W. McCann

Neil Simon is a lightweight.
He grinds out plays the way
craftsmen, in a better time,
made furniture: carefully
fitted, lovingly constructed, but
lacking the profundity or
monumentality of high art. I
know we mustn’t expect Simon
to be Shakespeare or even
Stoppard. We can, however,
expect him to be witty instead of
cute, and insightful instead of
banal.

Unfortunately he is, in both
cases, more often the latter.
Comedies of the British type
and tradition are really to be
preferred. Simon doesn’t have a
play that can match Hadrian
VII, The Jockey Club Stakes, or
Private Lives, all of which are
clever plays, dealing with in-
teresting people.

Now that my prejudice is
revealed, I can proceed to deal
with specifics, namely the
University Theatre production
of Barefoot in the Park, which
happens to be one of Simon’s
better attempts, along with The
Sunshine Boys, which many
critics consider his finest to
date. In fact, Bobby Carpentier
(whose Senior Drama Thesis
this is) tells us in the playbill
notes that Noel Coward
recommended Barefoot to
aspiring playwrights as a model

ssetcetaen

The action involves two
couples. The first is a young
attorney, and his frenetic and
silly wife of six days. The
second is the wife’s widowed
mother, and the young couple’s
new and eccentric neighbor,
Mr. Velasco. The young
couple’s adjustments to
brownstone living on 48th St.,
and to married life, are played
off the older couple’s already
ingrained foibles. Certainly the
comic potential is there.

And it is, by and _ large,
realized in this prodiction. Paul
Morella, as the young attorney,
did come off a bit stiff at the
beginning, but came alive with
the argument scene of Act II,
finally delivering the comic
coup-de-grace with the drunk,
out of the window action at the
close of the play.

The mother-in-law was
played by Rose Gordon, who
also hit her stride in Act II, after
the return from the Albanian
restaurant. Her performance in
the final act, in bathrobe and
slippers, came off very well
indeed.

Mr. Velasco is one of Simon’s
more successful characters,
and perhaps his most hilarity-
provoking. The flamboyant
Velasco was played to the hilt
by the exuberant John Ellis.
Along with Morella, this will be
Ellis’ last scheduled per-
formance in a show for the
University Theatre, and it

(continued on page 7)

Although the four major roles
were well cast and handled,
there were disappointments in
some of the smaller parts. Hub
Kennedy as Ben came on far too
strongly to suit me, and I just
can’t forgive him for spoiling
the mood after the climactic
scene in Act II. At the other end
of the spectrum from
Kennedy’s gangbusters
exuberance was Chip Brown as
Howard. Trying to look bored,
he succeeded only in boring. If
he did care about what he was
doing on stage, (and he was
trying to look interesting),
there was no hint of it in his
listless, unanimated voice.

Voice, in fact, was the major
downfall of the show. I wish Mr.
Hollinger had shown his cast a
half-dozen movies from the late
1940’s. His cast needed more
familiarity with the natural
cadences of American
colloquial speech. But, the
speech problem could have
been the result of self-
consciousness; in the second
act, once the cast had settled
themselves into what they were
doing, the artificiality in the

THE RING-TUM PHI 3
language disappeared.

The ensemble playing of the
four principals in the “Did you
plant?”’ scene is what the play is
all about. When it was over,
acting in my role as critic-
reviewer, the only note I could
take was a delighted, humble,
moved observation that the
scene had worked. In the end,
the whole play worked, because
the actors truly understood
where they were and what was
going on. There was _ in-
telligence, thought, and sym-
pathy, even in some of the
minor roles.

Ginger McNeese showed a lot
of spunk and humor as The
Woman, along with Phyllis
Davis and June Morgan, as
Letta and Miss Forsythe. By the
time these three had done their
bits, we had learned what the
myth of the American Bitch
Goddess is all about. Art Bloom
(Stanley) played his small role
with sensitivity, achieving
perhaps the greatest measure
of humanity and simple dignity.
And then there was Paul Cella
as Charley...perfect. He’s the

Golfers Drive For

National Showing

by Bob Burkholder

The W&L golf team got the
long anticipated invitation to
the Division III National Title
Tournament to be held at
Kenyon College in Gambier,
Ohio on May 24th thru the 27th.
The Generals will be compe"’ <
against twenty teams, vu
which is league foe Lynch. | ¢
College. The four day tour-
nament will consist of 72 holes
of golf. The four top scores of
each day’s action will count
towards the team’s score. The
Generals will be allowed to send
five golfers. It appears that they
will be Jerry Maatman, Gerry
Barousse, Dave Leunig, Terry
Shadrick, and Andy Fitzgerald.

Here is a short run down on
these five players: Jerry
Maatman has been number one
man for the Generals all season.
Jerry has also been captain of
the team for the past two
seasons. Maatman led the team
with a season average of 76
strokes per 18 holes. According
to Coach Leslie, Maatman
exhibits an excellent attitude
and leads by example. Jerry
was All-Conference this season.
Number two man for the year is
Gerry Barousse. Barousse
averaged 78 this season and
made All-Conference. Coach
Leslie praises Gerry’s con-
sistent play throughout the
season. ”

Playing number three man
will be Dave Leunig. Dave
averaged 79 this year. Leunig
was the ODAC Player-of-the-

1977 golfers:

Ist row, left to right:

Year and All-Conference. Dave
is a real streak shooter and
when his game is right he can
play with anyone. Coach Leslie
feels Dave’s competitiveness is
his best attribute. Fourth man
will be Terry Shadrick. Terry
had a season average of 78.5 and

also named All-Conference
th season. Consistency was
tue attribute that Coach Leslie
used to describe Terry’s play.
Andy Fitzgerald will be playing
number five man. Andy’s
season average was 79.5. After
a slow start, Andy came on
strong and was a key player in
the stretch run of a 10-1 season.
Leslie described Andy as a very
good competitor. Players who
will not be making the trip to
Gambier but made _ con-
tributions to the team’s success
are Bo Moorehead and Jim
Walter. Moorhead made key
contributions in the Generals
final two victories and Walter
was important in the team’s
early success.

Coach Leslie stresses the fact
that the tournament is a reward
for an excellent season but
quickly adds that it would be
great to win the tournament.
The chances of a high finish are
certainly within the realm of
possibility. The team has been
very consistent over the season
and this will be a definite asset
in the Nationals. The feeling of
the team is that an average
score in the 70s will be good
enough to put the Generals in
contention for the National

Title.

Generals Lose To Maryland

The Washington and Lee
lacrosse team finished the
season yesterday, with a dismal
performance, losing to the
University of Maryland
Terrapins 14-8 in the first round
of the NCAA playoffs. The

Kearney scores one of six.

Terps led by as many as eight
goals with twelve minutes to
play in the third quarter. The
Generals managed a five goal
rally in the third and early in
the fourth quarters to cut

Maryland’s lead to three goals,

Generals Dump
Nittany Lions

by Steve Smith

The 1977 lacrosse team
finished the regular season
defeating Penn State 22-14,
wrapping up the most
demanding schedule in the
University’s history. The
Generals end the regular season
with a 10-3 record, ranking them
sixth in the USILA University
Division poll. This will be the
sixth consecutive year W&L
stickmen have gone to the
national tournament.

Once again the outcome of the
game was in doubt until the
third quarter when the Generals
added nine more goals to their
half-time lead of 9-8. Chris
Kearney fired in six goals and
co-captain Jack Dudley added
three more in the win. Chris
Larson and Doug Fuge each had
a pair. Junior goalie Charlie

Brown stopped 13 Nittany Lion
shots and freshman face-off
specialist Bob Clements donned
his more familiar goalie stick
for part -of the second half,
saving 7 shots.

Sophomore’ _ attackman
Johnny Black had five goals and
four assists to make him the
ninth player in W&L history to
score over 50 points in one

season. With both Kearney and
Jeff Fritz having acheived this
earlier this month, the ’77 all-
sophomore attack have tallied
over 150 points this season.
Black also won the Cannon
Award for his all-around play
against Penn State.

The senior stickmen were
honored before the game, this
being their final regular season
game and their last home game
as a W&L lacrosse player.
At an informal awards
ceremony held Sunday evening,
senior co-captain Tom Keigler
was awarded this year’s Most
Valuable Player on the team.
Johnny Black received the Most
Improved Player award. Rising
seniors, Jay Sindler and Charlie
Brown were voted next year’s
co-captains.

As the ’77 Generals go to the
national tournament, they hope
for their first national crown.
They are paired in the first
round with Maryland and if they
can win at College Park, they
would go on to play the winner
of the Hopkins - North Carolina
game, May 21. The cham-
pionship finals will be played
May 28 at UVa.

 

but the Terrapins exploded with
a four goal knockout punch to
kill W&L’s chances for ad-
vancing in the tournament.

W&L avoided a shutout in the
first half on the merits of at-
tackman Doug Fuge’s shooting.
His first goal came with 2:15
remaining in the first quarter
on a feed from Johnny Black
during an extra-man situation.
Fuge, scoring on a rebound shot
with 2:40 left in the first half,
cut Maryland’s lead to four
goals. At the end of the first
half, the score stood, Maryland
6, W&L 2. These goals by W&L
represented the only semblance
of an attack. There seemed to
be a lack of confidence on the
part of the attack, particularly
in executing the offense on the
inside. The W&L middies were
completely dominated by their
Maryland counterparts, who
scored all six of the Terps’ first
half goals.

The second half started out
worse than the first. Maryland
scored eighteen seconds into the
third quarter to make it 7-2.
Less than a half a minute later,
the Terps scored again. The
third goal came with 12:40 left
in the third quarter. This was
the telling goal for Charlie
Brown. The unalert Brown was
yanked in favor of Bill Clements
for the rest of the game.

With half of the third quarter
still to play, the Generals began
to look like the team that had
given Maryland a run for its
money earlier in the season.
W&L scored five unanswered
goals to pull to within three
goals of tying the game. The
first of this barrage came from
attackman Jeff Fritz at 8:07 in
the third period. Then middie
Jay Sindler scored two
unassisted goals to cut the lead
to five. Soon after, Jack Dudley
scored off of a ground ball
pickup with 3:35 to play in the
third quarter. Early in the
fourth quarter, the lethargic
attackman Chris Kearney
finally got on track, and put in
his first goal of the day.

But Maryland refused to
buckle, and instead rolled off
four straight goals to put the
game out of reach. Kearney
scored the last goal of the game
at 10:54, making him this
season’s leading scorer with 66
points. Unfortunately the stick-
men were unable to shut down
Maryland’s offense, which had
65 shots, nor were they able to
penetrate the Terps’ tight
defense.

Pika Wins I-M Title

Second In Two Years

by Mickey Knapp
This year’s intramural
program was completed this
week. Three new champions
emerged. The Grandstanders
dominated in winning the track
meet, Law 2 & 3 won the softball

playoff tournament, and
Lambda Chi won it all in
volleyball.

In last week’s I-M track meet
the Grandstanders won easily
outscoring runner-up Phi Psi by
over thirty points. Individual

winners for the Grandstanders
included Jim Berlin in the
discus and javelin, Chris
Kearney in the high jump, and
Bruce Howard in the pole vault.
Charlie Brown took time off
from lacrosse practice to win
the mile run. First place
finishers for Phi Psi were Ed
Johnson in the 220 and Chip
Childs in the triple jump.

In Monday night’s softball
final Law 2 & 3 beat the
Grandstanders by a score of 5-3.

Law exploded for their five runs
in the first inning and then held
off the Grandstanders with
some outstanding fielding for
the winning margin. In the
volleyball final Lambda Chi
took Law I in two straight
games for the championship. In
the evening’s semi-final they
edged out a towering Phi Psi
team in three tough games.
Pika emerged as the years
overall points champions. They

Tennis Season Winds Down

Generals To Nationals

Next Year Looks Good

by Jim Barnes

The W&L netman finished a
highly successful tennis season,
defeating Emory and Henry 8-1
last Saturday, posting a 15-13
record overall. Unfortunately
the Generals were dumped by
the Naval Academy by the
same score last Thursday at
Annapolis. The only victory
came from Stewart Jackson
defeating his opponent 6-2, 6-2.
Under different circumstances
a 15-13 record might not seem
like much of an _e ac-
complishment, but this year it
is. One only needs to look at the
extremely difficult schedule the
Generals played this year. It
was filled with strong Division I
teams, such as Rollins, the
Naval the Naval Academy, and
the University of Florida, to
name a few. To compound the
problem, four of the starting six
players, (2) Stewart Jackson,
(4) Dee Keesler, (5) Richard
Makepeace, (6) David Constine,
were freshmen.

How much the schedule
helped the Generals’ freshmen
really won’t be known until the
conclusion of the nationals. But
at least this year’s opponents
have given six freshmen tough
match experience, winning and
losing, for next year’s season
that will start in the fall. A sign
that W&L’s team has gained
respectability is the willingness
of the Universities of Maryland,
Virginia, and Ohio to compete in
the W&L Fall tournament.

A particularly solid per-
formance this year was turned
in by Stewart Jackson. Jackson
hasn’t lost a match in twenty
outings since the early April
trip to Florida, and would be the
logical choice for the most
valuable player of this year’s
tennis team. Junior Ben Johns
also played well this season.
Every match he’s played, in-
cluding the defeats, he’s given
100 per cent hustle, and lost
many close matches in a tight
third set. The only player who
won’t be returning next year is
Senior Captain Ken Voekler.
The loss of this tough com-
petitor will be particularly felt
in the more inestimable sector
of leadership. The success of the
freshmen is a reflection of the

assistance and encouragement
he has given to them. Keesler,
Makepeace, and Constine, who
started of the season a little
shaky, have contributed more
wins in the last half of the
season. They exceptionally well
during the ODAC the tour-
nament and on the Washington
D.C. road trip. The team is also
lucky to have two fine freshmen
players, Pat Norris and Don
Shuford, at the number seven
and eight positions. Both have
played well at the number two
and three doubles spot during
the regular season.

Coach Dennis Bussard, ODAC
coach-of-the-year, is very
pleased with the team. He
remembers this year’s early
season match with Swarth-
more, the top ranked team in
Division III. At that time he
commented on the many
seniors on Swarthmore’s team,
and conjected that W&L’s
tennis team might be in Swarth-
more’s place in 1980. After this
year’s performance, there’s not
unfounded optimism for moving
that date up to 1979, or 1978. A
lot will depend on how Ben
Johns, Stewart Jackson, and
Dee Keesler do at the Division
III nations this week at Millsaps
College in Jackson, Mississippi.
Here the Generals have a
chance to gain some national
recognition. The tournament
runs from the 18th to the 22nd,
and is comprised of the best
players in Division ITI.

The team will be practicing in
the fall next year, not only for
the W&L tournament, but also
for the upcoming season.
Barring any significant un-
foreseen changes in the lineup,
next year the team should be
able to post a twenty game
winning season. It will only take
a reversal of the scores of a few
individual performances in
those close 4-5 and 3-6 losses in
team matches. Coach Bussard’s
optimism for next year’s team
is well founded.

there was a heated contest for’ |”

first place throughout the race
among the top four finishers
(Mike Burns, a senior member
of the track and cross-country
teams, placed fourth.)

Brian Adams and Mike Burns
came out of the starting block in
a virtual tie for first place that
did not break until the first
refreshment point at Bean’s
Bottom. It was there that
Adams took first with Burns
falling to second. Not far behind
was Schwab and Haynes.
Adams held onto the lead
throughout most of the race
until Schwab’s running ex-
perience overcame him. Then
Adams beat off a challenge
from Haynes for second place
with. a strong finish. Burns
came in fourth after some
severe leg cramps slowed him
down.

Other finishers in order of
their place were as follows:
Paul Morella, Grant Leister,
David Daynard, Dennis Hinkle,
Harry Shaw, Rick Fink,
Marshall Snyder, Robert An-

The race went smoothly with
all of the checkpoints being
manned by a sufficient number
of people and the Rescue Squad
flanking the entire route.
Despite some comments about
the length of the race (too long)
and the refreshment points (not
enough), the majority of the
contestants and organizers
were pleased.

Gallagher commented after
the race that, ‘“‘I was pleased

turnout was not as good as
expected, Gallagher said he
was happy with the large
number of W&L runners that
showed up (33 out of 39 con-
testants were from W&L). He
further poointed out that the
proceeds of over $100 will be
donated to the local MS fund
and that an account has been
opened for the Second Annual

might be held next fall.

really delighted that they
decided to donate the proceeds

regional meeting for MS in
Staunton, the regional officials
“‘were thrilled” about the event.
So when the race was over, all
of the runners (tired as they
were) took advantage of that
sun and had their picnic. Happy
and content with their ac-
complishment, the dreaded
enemy was once again the
friendly sun.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK |LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry

Easy Way Out?

Last week, the Ring-tum Phi ran a story entitled,
‘Graduate Summa without trying.’’ In essence, the
story revealed W&L’s gut courses. Thursday evening
at dinner — just two hours after the paper reached the
news stands — I couldn’t believe my eyes and ears;
everywhere I looked I could hear people gathered in
small groups griping and complaining about the
article. Comments ranging from, ‘‘Let’s shoot the guy
that wrote this story” to “Impeach the editor’’ could
be heard from these groups of disgruntled in-
dividuals.

Now I don’t want to offer any judgments about that
article or those individuals; I am only an observer.

However, there seems to be an undue amount of
jealousy and greed floating around our campus. W&L
students — long known for a tradition of honorly acts
and gentlemanly appearances — seem to have
deviated away from these ideals.

Judging from the comments I heard, a stranger
might have thought the Ring-tum Phi had just leveled
the structure of the curriculum at Washington and
Lee. It seemed like most of the students I heard, felt
cheated because the professor of an easy course
might have read that article and changed the make-
up of his course, making it harder.

Let me remind you, majoring in easy courses does
not make up an education. Every one of you has
chosen to come to college to get an education, yet
after hearing these fatalistic remarks about the
possibilities of losing the opportunity to receive an
“easy A’’ from a gut course, I really wonder if the
students of W&L are more concerned with cutting the
corners and getting easy grades or getting a good
education.

Some of these so called guts are easy because they
have faults in their structure. If that article in the
slightest way improved the nature of those courses,
then I believe the RtP has done a service to the school.
Remember, you have chosen to spend several
thousand dollars a year to come to a “‘good”’ school.
By rule, “‘a good school”’ usually is challenging. If you
want gut courses, then save your money and transfer
to a state school.

Editor:

Your editorial was certainly a
shock. The honor system can
and should be saved. Many
students today might be pleased
if it were to phase out. However,
later in life they will have
regrets.

What is the difference bet-
ween cheating and stealing?

If I may speak for the alumni,
you are certainly in the position
to do much for retaining and
rebuilding faith in it.

The alumni will always

cherish the honor system, -

students speaking and campus
dress.

Being a Class Agent I visit on
campus frequently. The dress is
far from being what it was but it
is still better than most cam-
puses. The students have
become careless in speaking.

Participation in a_ college
education is taken for granted
in the USA today. We were in
Russia in October; and a high
school education is compulsory
but there is only space for one
out of every twelve high school
graduates in college.

Earl T. Jones, ’30
(This note was attached to a
letter addressed to Bill Wash-
burn.)
Dear Bill:

This is the day of expectations
and ‘non-surprises’.
What do you expect the reaction
of the alumni to be upon reading
the editorial ‘A REALIZATION’
in the Friday, May 6th edition of
The Ring-tum Phi?

It has been a great feeling
being an alumnus of W&L; and I
boasted to friends, upon reading
an editorial in the local paper
concerning in excess of 90 per
cent of high school students
admitting that they cheated on
exams. When I would tell people
that the honor system at W&L
was still as effective as it had
always been I received stares.

Is it a disgrace to be

honorable today? Was J.
Michael Gallagher, Managing
Editor of THE RING-TUM PHI
writing about something that he
knew nothing about in the
editorial ‘A REALIZATION’?

Here is one short paragraph
from that editorial ‘‘Does the
faculty actually care or worry
about it? It doesn’t seem so. The
E.C. held an open house about
the honor system, and invited
the faculty. NOT ONE
SHOWED UP. (‘caps’ mine)”
No school system is effective
without faculty support.

Bill, the effect of the honor
system at W&L has been a great
influence on me. I have always
attributed the training received
from my parents and the en-
dorsement of that training at
W&L as the basic reason that I
have never had a decision to
make when it comes to ethics or
fair treatment.

I want you to explain to me
the meaning of the term ‘in-
dependent exams’ as referred
to in the editorial. Perhaps
something to do with the
weakened honor system.

Were the students par-
ticipating in their exams this
spring under the impression
that ‘anything goes’ as the days
of the honor system is
something of the past?

The alumni must believe that
the administration today has
weakened when they realize
that the honor system at W&L is
being treated as just a farce by
the students. Who was the great
American statesman who said
that he had rather be ‘right’
than President (Henry Clay). I
believe that the great majority
of the alumni had rather see
W&L close its doors than to bow
to what the administration
apparently believes is
necessary to be in agreement
with today’s trend. As Abraham
Lincoln said ‘right is right if
nobody is doing it and wrong is
wrong if everybody is doing it’.

We are visiting with Eleanor
and Stuard Wurzburger May 23-
25; and I certainly hope to hear
from you that every effort is
being made by the ad-
ministration to restore the
honor system to the level that it
has enjoyed.

Earl] T. Jones, ’30

Editor:

Congratulations on your
editorial about the Honor
System.

Whether you are right or
wrong, you are being con-
structive. And honest.

If you are wrong, your
editorial will surely strengthen
the Honor System by alerting
everyone involved that at least
you think the system has failed.

If you are right, and like most
graduates I pray you are not,
Washington and Lee is no longer
Washington and Lee.

The name should be changed
to “‘Nixon and Mitchell’’.

I mean that.

There are hundreds of
colleges and universities.

But none could surpass the
Washington and Lee so many of
us knew and loved and
respected because of its Honor
System. Like you, that Honor
System played a major role in
why we went to W&L; that
Honor System was our greatest
inspiration from Washington
and Lee. It has helped us more
than all the classes we ever
took.

So, if you are right and the
Honor System has been sullied,
soiled, and shamed by the
present student body, I hope the
system is done away with and
the school’s name is changed.
Perhaps it should not be
changed to “Nixon and Mit-
chell”’ but to the names of those
student leaders who failed its
traditions of honor.

Robert M. White II ’38

 

Error In

May 17, 1977
Sir:

There has been a great deal of
talk om campus about the Honor
System in recent weeks: does it
work, and who makes it work? I
have some thoughts on the
matter, and this letter is a
result of those thoughts and a
personal experience.

On a recent trip to Goshen, a
friend and I were joking about
the Honor System, viz., ‘‘that is
only counts during school hours,
not on weekends, or off cam-
pus.”’ We stopped at a nearby
store along the way for beer,
cigarettes, and a pair of
sunglasses. I put the sunglasses
on and removed the price tag, to
give to the cashier on the way
out. On the way out, however,
the cashier said nothing, my
friend said nothing, and I said
nothing, and I walked out with a
pair of stolen sunglasses. The
incident was not discussed with
my friend, and was not referred
to again.

Upon a later visit to the store,
alone this time, I included the
sunglasses with my groceries

and paid for them then. My
friend, who had been con-
sidering referring the matter to
the E.C., came to me with his
dilemma. I told him my story,
and he asked me to turn myself
in.

Upon further discussion, we
decided that, in light of the
current campus cynicism and
doubt about the Honor System,
a better solution would be an
open letter to the University
community. We hope to achieve
two things by this: first, to clear
up this particular case, and
more importantly, to argue a
case for the validity of the honor
system.

We think that the Honor
System can work. In this case,
we think it has. Granted, there
will always be honor violations;
the point is that a feeling of
personal honor has prompted

Judgement Or H. V.?

me to make restitution to the
store, and to accept full and
open responsibility for my

. actions. The Honor System

works fine in theory — this time
it has worked in practice as
well. To see it work more often,
I would suggest more openness
and less secrecy in dealing with
honor cases. Perhaps we could
Start a tradition of a convicted
student publishing an open
letter (similar to this), and the
E.C. publicly vidicating in-
nocent students in the same
manner. The advantages of this
policy would be to foster candor
and trust among members of
the community, and would
lessen the prejudice against a
questioned student.

Respectfully,
Hunt Brown, ’79

which, coincidentally, he was
invited. He was the organizer
for this year end party right
from the start. But when it went
public, Larkin became a bastion
of fiscal conservatism.

But it seems he hasn’t the
courage of his convictions, or
maybe just the wherewithal,
and so he is now all for using
student funds.

Another rep who is shakey is
law rep Goddard. Following his
courageous stand on the
marijuana issue recently, we
had hopes for his high moral
principles, but it seems that he
too is on a bum trip.

Three cheers for the Honor
System. It seems that Bob
Chiavello had a party out at his
place last weekend and a half
full keg of beer just up and
disappeared. We all know how
W&L men drink, but swallowing
the container too? Really,
gentlemen! Such manners.

Mike Gallagher, noted editor,
world traveler and bon vivant,
just can’t seem to turn off that
animal magnetism. At a party
at Goshen last Friday, two
young ladies of impeccable
breeding just totally lost control
of their senses and begged our
hero for the opportunity to rub
suntan oil on his back. MG,
repelled by the 200 plus pounds
of women on the hoof, was
forced to politely decline. Too
bad, the Nose has to apply the
sun oil all by its lonesome.

There is a big flap going on
between the powers that be and
the Calyx editorial staff over a
picture of dubious propriety.
Calyx editor Rob deSylvester
says that it would have been
more obvious if he had taken out
the offending part than it was by
leaving the picture in. After all,
it took a week to find it! Well,
Rob, naughty, naughty. Of
course, R. E. R. is a past
member of DTD and it is easy to
understand that he might be P.
O. ed.

That’s about all for this year
Nosewigs, remember the best
news in the world is right out in
front of that beak between your
eyes. Breathe deep, look far and
find it out for yourself.

led throughout the year often by
a wide margin, and eventually
won by over 60 points. Sima Chi
edged out Phi Psi by 5 points to
take second place. Outstanding
player for Pika this year was
Jim Fisher. He was named to
five all star teams during the
course of the year.

Ending up in fourth place in
the overall point standings this
year were the Grandstanders.
Manager Jim Crytzer did a
remarkable job of organizing
their teams. This year’s
Grandstanders were the first
independent team ever to
compete in the total points race.

presented at this Thursday’s

by Lee Howard

If he had been elected
President of the United States in
te “We would have made the
biggest mud puddle in the world
out of Vietnam,’’ said Sen.
Barry M. Goldwater to a very
receptive audience of about 200
persons at Lee Chapel on
Thursday, May 12.

Goldwater, R-Ariz., said the
United States should have let
the military take care of the
war effort, rather than the
politicians. He said that if the
country had done this, we would
have been able to win the war in
Vietnam.

Goldwater said the military
must be kept strong. He said
there are some groups in the
United States that want to let
the country grow weak by
forcing it into unilateral
disarmament — disarmament
of the U. S. without disar-
mament of the Russians or
Chinese. Goldwater said he also
wants disarmament, but only if
it’s multilateral — if all sides
disarm at once, with on-site
inspection to make sure there is

full compliance with the terms
of the multilateral disar-
mament agreement.

Until such multilateral
disarmament is agreed upon,
the United States must not risk
being the second-best military
power, he said. He then made
an analogy between nations and
little children at recess.
Goldwater said when he was a
boy it was inevitable that every
recess he’d get into a fight with
someone, but he had never had
to fight someone again who he
had whipped, or someone who
knew Goldwater could whip
him. If the United States was in
a position to whip any nation
that tried to attack it, no one
would try, he said. “‘When we
decide to be strong we won’t
have to go to war,” he said.

Goldwater said that if the
United States had had a ‘‘strong
political posture” with regard
to its allies, World War II never
would have happened. Hitler
never intended to go to war, he
said, but our weak political
posture, because of
isolationism, allowed him to
make his move. Goldwater said
he sees the ‘“‘same feeling of

isolationism of the period of the
’30s’’ today, and this is
dangerous.

The Senator said we are
“driving toward global con-
flict’ caused by a ‘‘scenario of
miscalculations.”’ He said there
are ‘‘many scenarios for
another Korea.’’ He indicated
that one of these scenarios
might be in Panama. He said if
Panama decided to go to war he
doesn’t think the United States
would fight. He said that one of
the reasons for this is because of
a heavily-armed Cuba. If
Panama doesn’t get a “fair
share”’ in negotiations with the
U. S., they will go to war,
predicted Goldwater.

Goldwater said the Russians
are our “‘logical enemy.” “We
are watching them in the most
extensive war preparations in
history,’ he said. Goldwater
said the Russian navy is better
than our navy, but the U. S.
navy “can still function as a
two-ocean navy.’’ Goldwater
assessed the U. S. Air Force as
superior to the Russian coun-
terpart. He said the reason for
this is that the U. S. has fought
two air wars since the Russians
fought their last. Goldwater
also said the U. S. is superior in
computer technology. The
Russians are 20 years behind in
computer technology, he said.
He said the reason for this is
that the Russians ‘‘are not good
copiers.”’ ‘‘You give the
Japanese something and
they’ve got it,” he said, but the
Russians ‘‘don’t catch on fast.”’
million for each advanced
fighter plane made in the U. S.,
he said. He also said weapons
systems are also getting more
expensive. Some bombers, with
six missiles aboard, carry about
$1 million worth of ammunition,
ne said.

The audience, which gave
Goldwater a standing ovation
when he was _ introduced,
nevertheless asked the senator
some tough estions when

with mafia figures. The senato
denied any knowledge of th
figures’ mafia ties or any close
and intimate friendship with
any of the figures. Talking
about one figure, Willy Bailov,
he said the mafia ‘‘blew hi
up.” “They did a good job. All
they found was his thumb,”’ the
Arizona senator said.

Finally, Goldwater told the
youthful crowd never to give up
on our political system.
‘“‘Maintain an interest in our
country,” he said. ‘The country
comes before the party,’’ the
senator said.

Most actors love applause,
even if they won’t admit it, but
after the Requiem, no one

them. No one was willing to be
the first to break the spell, to

theatre where their bodies were

8 THE RING-1UM PHI
Land Fraud

(continued from page 2)

Once the teams swung into
high gear, it was obvious the
class had stumbled upon a
larger mess than it had an-
ticipated. Bales had been
responsible for several in-
famous apartment construction
and suburban development
projects in southwest Virginia.
Rakes had terved time in prison
for a variety of offenses. Both
were in hot water with a
number of banks.

Four trips to the Bristol-
Abingdon area, two to Bluefield,
W. Va., several to Harrisonburg
and Staunton, a number to
Roanoke and Richmond, and
one to Kentucky yielded
members of the class a con-
siderable amount of in-
formation. What they have are
profiles of several exceedingly
‘slick’? businessmen who
operate in the ‘‘grey” area of
the law. Leads stretch from
New Jersey to Florida. If the
amount of information the class
now has is enormous, then the
amount left to be uncovered is
simply colossal.

In the process of the in-
vestigation, it became obvious
that others had come before —
the FBI, the State Police, the
Internal Revenue Service. But
yet the whole story had never
seen print. Individual pieces of
the story had found their way
into papers, but only when they
directly concerned the
respective circulation areas.
People in Bristol did not know
what had occurred in West
Virginia, and vice-versa. The
story, for the most part, was all
out in the open; it had just never
been pulled together before.

Most of the story of the ac-
tivities of Bales, Rakes, Berry,
and their associates (including
Sheffield) has been assembled.
This week it is being whittled
down to a workable size — a
series of three or four articles.
The class wants to have its
findings published, to warn
people before any more ven-
tures reach fruitation. Already,
the Roanoke, Bristol and
Bluefield papers have ex-
pressed interest in running the
story. With any luck at all, the
story should see print in the
next month.

doing.

Ed Backus, printmaster
emeritus. Though retired, Ed
deserves this award as much as
anybody. Ed’s printing finesse
is legend, but it’s as a human
being that he’s missed the most
around the Shop.

The W&L Print Shop is
something special, and it’s the
staff that makes it so. The
decision made by the University
administration earlier this year
to eliminate a majority of the
Shop’s print operations will, if
fully realized, mean the end of
the Print Shop as it is now
known. Persons close to the
real, if lost, spirit of this
University will then mourn the
death of an honorable tradition.
