Spring brings Orleans
and Crack the Sky

by FRITZ GOLDBERG

Orleans will be the lead act for
Springs Weekend according to the
usual knowledgeable sources on
the SAB.

The band, purveyors of such
classic hils as “Still the One,”
“Dance with Me” and “Let there
be Music,” will be backed up by
Crack The Sky, the people who
missed the Winter concert, and
Chris Rush, a comedian who re-
portedly told the SAB’s agent the
job would be something of a chal-
lenge for any comedian after the
considerably less-than-gentleman-
ly deseription given by some of
the reception given to a stand-up
comic who narrated the controver
sial Spinners Concert last spring.

Rush will charge $800 for the
challenge, while Orleans and
Crack the Sky will charge $7500
and $2000, respectively.

Annual Black Ball

in Evans Saturday

by BOB CHIAVIELLO

For all of those poor people
who are feeling the post Fancy
Dress Blues there is hope! Tab
Brown, the coordinator of Black
Awareness Activities, promises
that this year’s Black Ball will be
bigger and better than ever.

The theme for this Saturday's
Ball is “A Night at the Copa.”
rhe festivities begin at 7:30 p.m
on Saturday with a cocktail party
at the Alumni House. This party is
open to everyone with a ticket
After the cocktail party everyone
will head on over to Evans Dining
Hall te bask in the recreated at
mosphere of the famous Copa Cab
bana. The band for the evening
will be Anglo Saxon Brown, a big
contemporary soul band with both
rock and gospel influences. The
band features eight vocalists and
they promise to put on a great
show. There will be non-aleoholix
refreshments served at the Ball,
put there will be no beer allowed

Members of the Student Associa
tion for Black Unity, the Student
Activities Board, and others will
be working feverishly next
few days to decorate Evans with a

The weekend will begin with
the traditional BYOB, party at the
Pavillion on Thursday night. The
Thursday night in question will be
April 14, 1977, and the perform-
ers for the party will be the Mar-
vellettes, presenting their show
for $950, one-third off their usual
price, according to Bob Chia-
viello, SAB member.

The ladies are reducing their
prices as a means of doing pen-
ance for backing out of the Home-

coming dance. The back-out at
that event cost the SAB about

$1000 when they were forced to
substitute another band at the last
minute and cancel the $1 admis-
sion fee to avoid anger from stu-
dents who felt slighted by the
lack of Marvellettes at the dance.

Crack the Sky agreed to appear
for the concert in order to fulfill
their contract obligations left
over when James Talley replaced
them at the Winter concert.

The Spring concert will be on
Friday, April 15, and tickets will
cost W&L students $2.50 in ad-
vance. Cost for all others will be
$3.50 in advance. The cost at the
door will be $4 for all comers. The
concert will be held in the new
gym

Although there is no lacrosse
game before the junior class grain
party on Saturday, April 16, Chia-
viello said the SAB will be pre
senting several “immodest” acti
vities to brighten up other Satur
days in the Spring term

Although Chiaviello would not
elaborate, sources close to the
SAB say there may be a grain
party or other amusements follow
ing the U. Va. game the following
weekend

Bodenstab, Craig Cornett, Walton
Clark, Cove Geary, Jacob Jones,
Ned McDonnell, Sam Perkins and
Tom Salley.

Vying for president of the class
of ’80 are Greg Dyer, Les Cotter,
Sonny Wilkinson and Murray Mc-
Clintock. Vice-presidential candi-
dates are: Jeff Barlett, Dave Con-
stine, Carl Lowder and Hugh Mon-
tgomery.

The two referenda that will try
again on Monday are a proposed
amendment to the constitution
that would move freshman elec-
tions ahead two weeks and an-
other that would give the E.C. the
power to remove a candidate from
the ballot for breaking E.C.-im-
posed rules.

Both proposals received appro
val by a majority of the students
voting but neither received the
two-thirds majority required for
addition to the constiution, nor
cid enough students vote. Fifty
per cent of the student body must
vote on proposed amendments in
order for them to pass.

Only about 500 persons voted
in the March 7 elections. Approxi
mately 850 must vote for any
amendment to pass.

E. C. members expressed the
hope thal because so many per-
sons were running for office in
Monday’s election there would be
a greater voter turnout.

The other two amendments to
be included on the ballot are one
that would give freshmen equa!
representation on the E.C. and
one that would limit the number

Workers sought

for game room

In an effort to provide more
games for students and to keep
damage in the game room to a
minimum, the W&L Cockpit is
looking for students to keep order
in the game room.

This is a long established tra-
dition which fell into disuse dur-
ing the last few years and which
Jerry Darrell is trying to revive.

The duties will be light, and
students will have some, though
not full-time, game privileges and
will be able to earn $1 an hour be-
sides

Darrell is trying to increase the
variety of games available to stu-
dents, in addition to other changes
made in the Cockpit

Such additions will include, Dar
rell hopés, ping pong, chess,
checkers and darts

The work will consist of issu
ing pool cues and balls, making
change, issuing chess and checker
sets, and preventing the entry of
beer and other forbidden liquors
into the game room

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

 

So much for non-participation in student government,
We've got more people running here than in the Boston Mara-
thon.

Now let's take a look at some of the activities in which
various student governmental bodies are engaged:

The Student Control Committee, enforcement arm of the
office of the Dean of Students, has announced stiff new penal-
ties for smoking marijuana in the dorms (see Randy Smith's
article on this page).

This move is so ridiculous that it’s difficult to decide how
to attack it. It's stupid, senseless, and repressive. It surprises
me because I had always respected the University policy on
drugs as being fairly realistic, Pot smoking, while not officially
condoned, was generally recognized as a normal social activity
and hence enforcement and punishment were generally kept
to a minimum.

The only conceivable argument against smoking is on legal
grounds. But, as Mr. Smith points out, the legal argument ts
being applied only to this one “crime.” And it's becoming in-
creasingly obvious that not only pot smokers but also a grow-
ing number of other people—lawyers, judges, politicians, mecli-
cal experts—find the laws against possession to be worthless,
or worse still, counterproductive.

From Mary Russell’s March 15 Washington Post article :

The Carter administration yesterday endorsed re-
moving federal criminal penalties for possession of small
amounts of marijuana, but said it should be left to the
states to decide whether to decriminalize their own pos-
session laws.

Dr. Peter G. Bourne, director-designate of the Office
of Drug Abuse Policy, said decriminalization “seems to
have been an effective and appropriate approach” in the
eight states that have dropped criminal penalties for
simple possession so far ., .

Bourne said the criminal penalties for possession are
“counterproductive” and “have resulted in otherwise
law-abiding young people spending time in prison and
incurring permanent damage to their careers and their
ability to enter professions.”

He said as many as 35 million Americans have tried
marijuana and as many as 11 million are now using the
drug at least weekly. The sixth annual report of the Na-
tional Institute of Drug Abuse released last week said
15 milion people used marijuana once or more times in
the month preceding its survey.

One can only hope that the legal argument against possession
and use of marijuana will indeed soon be put to rest, clearing
the way for the Student Control Committee and theid admini-
tration masters to group their way out of the Dark Ages,

Something else bothers me about this. Washington an‘
Lee's most distinguishing and valuable feature has long been
its faith in the individual and the individual's right to self-

ernment without external controls. This sudden lureh in the
other direction must come as a shock to any student who has
come to value that liberty which both our nation and our Uni-
versity claim to insure. Unless, of course, he has suffered so
many blows to his liberty that one more seems to mak: litth

In a statement dated March 8
(but posted the 13th), the Student
Control Committee announced
new penalties for marijuana smok-
ers in the Washington and Lee
dormitories, The new, more strin-
gent penalties—(1) a minimum of
a $50 fine, (2) a minimum of two
weeks social probation, and (3) a
letter home to the parents about
the incident—will be imposed on
any dormitory resident who is
“caught with marijuana ina dor-
mitory, whether in his room or
another’s room, whether smoking
or voluntarily in the presence of
persons smoking marijuana.”

The edict issued from Student
Control implies that W&L fresh-
men have a serious drug problem.
There are “widespread, illegal ac-
tivities” going on in the dormi-
tories—an expression of a subver-
sive revolutionary outbreak in
the offing, perhaps. Certainly, the
phrasing of the statement sug-
gests that a large number of peo-
ple are involved in these ‘“‘wide-
spread” law breaking activities. In
fact, however, “seven or eight”
freshmen have come before the
Committee for marijuana viola-
tions in the past six months.

David Meyer, President of the
Freshman class and member of the
Student Control Committee—and
who, by the way, voted in favor
of the more austere punishments
—explained the implementation of
the new penalties as a result of an
apparent escalation of “open”
marijuana use. According to Mey-
er, three cases came before the
Committee in late February. They
were interpreted as examples that
fragrant drug use in the dorms
was on the rise and that the old
penalties (a $15-$25 fine and one
week dorm probation) were not
enough.

Meyer explained thatthe Uni-
versity has an agreement with the
Lexington police to handle mari-
juana smokers in the dormitories
(in the person of Student Control);
in return, the police will not raid
the campus. The grim picture Mey-
er painted conjured images of po-
lice making indiscriminate mid-
night raids in search of drug
abusers. He said the new penal-
ties were a “deterent’” and that
“in the long run, everyone will be
benefited by them; they are in
the best interest of everyone in
the dorms” because they will keep
the police out.

Head dorm counselor Tony Van
Burg, when asked if the Student
Control Committee’s pronounce
ment meant that dorm counselors
might engage in special search
and spying procedures, replied
that he did not condone such ac
tivities. He went on to say that the
new penalties “should have been
instituted earlier” because it
would be unfair for those caught
after March 8, to suffer more
stringent punishment than those
caught before

Despite Meyer's positive “bene
fits” attitude and Van Den Burg’s
assurances against intensified co-
vert dorm counselor surveillance
activities, there have been grumb
lings im the freshmen dorms
Some view the new penalties as
oppressive and dated, Others
point to the changing national at
titude discounting marijuana as
the dangerous drug its crities de
scribe it as. But such arguments
do not affect the rules of Wash-
ington and Lee

In its policy, the University does
not concern itself with moral
questions or the mounting body of
ssientifie fact exculpating the
myths surrounding marijuana
That dope has become increasing
ly more accepted, has been de
criminalized in a growing number
of states, and that the Carter Ad
ministration recently reconmmmend
ed home plant growers of the
drug not be prosecuted, are not at
issue

University policy revolves
around the illegality of marijuana
in the State of Virginia (Cade of
Virginia, Tithe 18, 18.2250, 18.2
964, 18.2-265). As far as the school
is concerned, the law is the law

right or wrong—and the Univer
sity will not allow students to
break state law on school pro

perty. And it is in their support
of University policy where the
Student Control Committee is in
consistent

jever mind the fact that the
Committee's penalties for dope

jokers have changed (and, in
deed. have become more stricl) a

the years have passed, or that the
penalty can change on the Com-
mittee’s whim with no method for
appeal—these are trivial
sistencies. If the Student Control
Coremiltee is really dedicated to
following University policy by up-
holding the law, why are they se-
lective in the laws they choose to
sustain? i

Title 4, of the Code of Virginia,
addresses itself to alcoholic bev-
erages. Three laws in particular
pertain to W&L freshmen (4-71,
4-73.2, 4-78). 4-73.2 is the most im-
portant of the three for it is con-
cerned with the “purehase or pos-
session of alcoholic beverages by
persons under 21.” The number of
W&L freshmen who have violated

Smoking pot in dorms? ---
your mother. should know

this statute (and continue to do
so) is, if not a majority, a signi-
ficant minority. We are not talk-
ing about “7 or 8” freshmen, but
well over 200.

Another interesting Virginia law
(Title 18, 18.2-68), discusses ‘‘se-
duction” and leading a female “as
tray from the paths of virtue.” It
is, apparently, a rather significant
statute because it carries a pen-
alty of 2-10 years in jail (as op-
posed to up to 12 months and-or
up to $1000 fine for possession of
marijuana).

But freshmen who use alcohol
or who are guilty of corrupting a
female's virtue are safe. The Stu-
dent Control Committee can be se-
lective in the Virginia State laws

it chooses to uphold-—all in the
good name of University policy.
Apparently, drinking and seduc-
tion are not important because
dorm counselors are allowed to
handle those incidents; they are
socially acceptable laws to break
—-as long as you are careful. But
inhale a breath of marijuana in
the dormitories, and you have
crossed the line. Your fate is not
to be counselled, but punished.

To voice his opinion on the new
penalties, an anonymous heretic
defaced one of the Committee’s
posted prociaimations with: “Help
bring W&L out of the Middle Ages
--smoke dope wherever you like.”
He is one of those subversive re-
volutionaries, no doubt.

Warsaw Pantomime Company
shares talent with drama students

by M. GRAY COLEMAN

Arthur Graham Glasgow, noted
engineer, was an honorary alum-
nus of Washington and Lee for
many years. Upon his death in
1955, he bequeathed a generous
sum to the University with this
recommendation for its use: “I!
is hoped that all such income may
be used to promote the art of ex-
pression of art by pen and tongue

in this way, the well-known
Glasgow Endowment Program was
initiated. Katherine Anne Porter,
author of such novels as Ship of
Fools and Pale Horse, Pale Rider,
inaugurated the program with her
arrival aS the first visiting Pro
fessor in 1959. She was followed
by a long line of distinguished ar
tists, including: Edward Albee
Howard Nemerov, Robert Penn
Warren, Kar! Shapiro, James Dic
key and last year, a most suc
cessful symposium on modern fi
tion with Walker Percy, Grace
Paley, Donald Barthelme, and
William Gass

This year, the Glasgow Endow
ment Committee has provided
Washington and Lee with an en
tirely new experience. The War
Pantomime Company, having
brought to Lexington during thi
past autumn two stunning perfor
mances of their repertory, “The
Mirror” and “Beyond the Word,”
have returned for the rest of thi
term as Artists-in-Residence and
visiting lecturers in theatre. The
founders of the Company—Raj
mund Klechot, Stefan Niedzial
kowski, Zdzislaw Starczynowski
ind Andrzej Szczuzewski—began
their careers as members of the
Wroclaw Mime Theatre under the
direction of Henryk Tomaszewski
and for many years created a var
iety of major roles in production
at theatres and festivals around
the world, During these
they developed their own, origina
theory of pantomime. Finally, in
left Tomaszewski afte
more than a decade, and formed
group. Today they are

associated with the Warsaw Cham
ber Opera Company

During their sixeweek stay, the
compan } teachin within the
Drama 140 vies course. a course

designed to embrace different as
pects of theatre art every year.
The four founders have been join
ed in Lexington by the fifth mem-
ber of their company, Ms. Jolanta
Kruszewska, formerly the pre
miere ballerina of the Wroclaw
Opera. This classically trained
group, renowned across Europe
and beyond, are now forming a
show for this University, to be
presented on March 23-25, Wed-
nesday through Friday ,at the
Troubadour Theatre.

The turnout of students has been
especially encouraging; over 35
peovle are participating in the in

truction sessions and show re

hearsals. They include many W&L
students, as well as a healthy num
ber of auditors from the town it-
self.

The group was told to approach
their new assignment in a simple
way; they were to act as if their
students knew nothing about

Letter Uo The Editor

Dear Sir

\fter last week's crowded Stu
dent Control Committee schedule
I think it only wise to address the
student body through our paper
concerning the subject of student
misconduct down the road. There
have been enough cases of mis
conduct down the road this year to
cause certain members of our ad
ministration to worry about our

itus as gentlemen. The faculties
and administrations of the sur
rounding girls’ schools have been
so alarmed that at times they have
personal letters back to
administration stating their
unhappiness and even disenchan
ment W&L students who
have caused trouble al their re
peclive campuses

Old Generals never die, they just keep coming back to haunt you.

Stickmen lose confidence

“We're at a point now where
we've lost a little of our confi-
dence,” says head coach Jack Em-
mer, “We did not play real well in
the win over Virginia Tech, and
we were tight in the Mt. Wash-
ington game.” The coach’s senti-
ments are echoed in the fact that
the Generals, now 2-0 in NCAA
games, and 2-1 overall, escaped
with a 10-2 win over Virginia
Tech, despite leading only 3-1 at
the half.

‘Middle Doug Fuge, named the
winner of the Cannon Award for
his play in tae Tech game, opened
the scoring at 8:50 of the second
quarter tossing in a rebound from
in front of the cage to break a
scoreless tie. Less than two min-
ules later, Fuge scored an extra
man goal to give the Generals a
iwo goal margin. Seven second
haif goals, two by the teams’ lead-
ing scorer Chris Kearney, propell-
ea W&L to the 10-2 win.

The Mt. Washington contest was
a lesson for W&L younger players
on how to make the most of your
opportunities. The 1976 lacrosse
cub champions, composed of
many former All-American per-
formers, including W&L’s Rob
Lindsey and Brian Chasney, put
on a first class shooting exhibi-
tion on Wilson Field. After lead-
ing 3-0 after one quarter of play,
ithe Generals found themselves
trailing 7-3 at the half.

The remainder of the game,
despite the fact that W&L scored
four fourth quarter goals, was a
exercise in futility. Emmer noted,
“We thought Tom Keigler played
weil against the Wolfpack, and
Chris Kearney went to the goal
well, bul some of our freshmen
haven't progressed quite as quick-
ly as we had hoped they would.”

The coaching staff singled out
freshmen midfielders Roman Ku-
pecky and Joe Olive, defenseman

Rod Roberts, and attack Mike
Schuler as four first year men
who have shown well in the team’s
first three games. The first year
men will have to hold their own
during the Generals’ upcoming
three game homestand if the team
hopes to be ranked in the nation’s
top ten teams in the national
rankings. The first USILA rank-
ings will be released on Monday,
March 21.

At one o’clock on Friday, March
4, a new first took place at Wash-
ington and Lee. The W&L Weight-
lifting Club sponsored their first
meet, a power meet, with VMI as
their guests.

The program included the stan-
dard power lifts-—bench press,
full squat, and deadlift—as well as
one exercise lift used especially
by football players and track and
field competitors, the clean. This
lift was the first performed and
each contestant was given three
chances to score his highest
weight. Ed Wick, president of the
club and pictured in last week's
Ring-tum Phi, scored the highest
in this lift with a 255 pound clean.
Ed was the only lifter in the meet
to make use of a full squat clean,
similar to that used by Olympians.
This is a very difficult method,
and requires great skill and pra-
tice to execute properly.

The meet’s lifters were divid
ed into six weight classes. W&L
scored victories in five of these.
Mickey MeKay won a decisive vic
tory for W&L at the 132-pound
class with a composite of 900

Swimmers head for championships

Seven W&L swimmers will be
spending this Thursday through
Saturday in Oberlin, Ohio com-
peting in the 1977 NCAA Division
It] Swimming Championships. The
Generals had six All-Americans
last season, and finished as the
eighth ranked Divfsion III team in
the country.

Head Coach Bill Stearns ex-
pects this years’ team to duplicate
that feat, if not surpass it. St. Law-
rence University of Canton, N. Y.
is the defending champion, with
Johns Hopkins favored in this
years’ meet. The top twelve swim-
mers in each event will be named
All-American performers for 1976-
77. Over 500 swimmers through-
out the country compete in each
event during the regular season,
with about eighty of them qualify-
ing for the national champion-
ships. The top twelve will then be
named All-Americans.

The W&L contingent travelling
to Oberlin College will be headed
by two-time national champion
and nine-time Ali-American John
Hudson, a junior freestyle special-
ist from Lancaster, Pa. Hudson, a
1976-77 co-captain, is the defend-
ing national champion in the 500
and 1650 freestyle events, and was
also named an All-American on
the W&L 800 free relay team in
‘76. The Generals’ other co-cap-
tain, Tad Van Leer, was an A-A
in the 50 free last season.

Keith Romich and Chip Hoke, a
pair of sophomores, round out the
four returning A-A going back for
another shot this season. Three
blue chip freshmen will also be
representing W&L this weekend.
Freestylers Scott Duff and Bob

Newcomb, along with backstroker -

and individual medley performer
Drew Pillsbury will be aiming to
become A-A in their first collegi-
ate season.

Weightlifters win first meet

by a 285 pound full squat. Ed
Wick followed by winning the
198 class with a 1225 pound total,
and John X. Miller took control of
the 220-pound class with a pheno-
mental 1315 pound total. A 460-
pound deadlift highlighted his
competitive performance. Mark
Duncan, another 20-pounder, set
the meet bench press record with
an astounding 310-pound lift.

The W&L iron men put in a
great deal of time and effort to
attain their high degree of excell-
ence. They plan to sponsor an-
other meet in late April, and VMI
promises to put forth a much
stronger showing.

New Chinese program offered

March 7th,

By a vote of the faculty on
W&L students who

would like to begin or continue
the study of Chinese among the
Chinese themselves now have a
means to do so.

This summer, for the first time,

W&L will conduct a ten-week sum-
mer program in Taiwan where stu-
dents may earn up to nine credit
hours for language study.

This summer program has been

made possible by the generous
subscription of Mr. Sung-hsiung
Ilung, a Taiwan industrialist.

Mr. Hung has offered to pro-

vide, free of cost, room, board and

extensive

local and recreational

travel for five W&L students each
summer for a period of three
years.

Students will, as a result, have
to pay only a tuition fee plus their
transportation to and from Tai-
wan. The exact amount of the tui-
tion has not yet been fixed, but it
is expected to be moderate in
view of the subscription.

The program, tentatively sche-
duled to begin in Taiwan on June
20th an end on August 28th, will
be conducted by Dr. Harold C.
Hill, Director of East Asian
Studies, with a staff of native in-
structors.

Track team wins
first outdoor meet

by JERRY HARRIS

It wasn’t very pretty but it was

a victory. Those were the feelings
of the Washington and Lee track
team Saturday after they had
come from behind to defeat David-
son College 81-64 in the first out-
door meet of the season.

The Generals had easily beaten

Davidson last year and during the
recently completed indoor season,
so the away meet was not consid-
ered a stiff test for them. How-
ever, the combination of the long
trip, bad weather, some key in-

juries and an

inspired perfor-

mance by the homestanding Wild-
cats gave W&L a tough match.

Halfway through the non-con-

ference dual meet the Generals
found themselves down by 11
points. That was not so bad ex-

cept that co-captain John Tucker
was injured and they were miss-
ing Hix Green in the hurdles. But
strong performances by Phil Dun-
ley, Paul Thomson and Jack Nor-
berg pulled the Generals on top.

Norberg and Dunlay were dou-
ble winners for the Generals. Dun-
lay took top honors in the shot

ning mile relay team.

Other first place winners for

three places in the 800 meter run
which was the pivotal race of the

was happy they could come back

of fifteen hours per week in actual
classroom work during eight of
the ten weeks of their stay. The
first week will be devoted to
orientation and local sightseeing.
The final week will include a trip
over the entire island of Taiwan
in the company of six Chinese
University students. During the
academic portion of the program,
weekend excursions together with
Chinese students are also planned.

According to Dr. Hill, students
desiring to begin the Chinese
language should be encouraged to
go through this program and to
continue their study on a more
advanced level at Washington and
Lee. The Taiwan courses will be
closely coordinated with offerings
in Lexington.

The summer courses are spon-
sored by the East Asian Studies
Program which already offers
study in Taiwan and Japan during
the six week Spring Semester. The
new program will, therefore, also
provide a means for students par-
ticipating in Spring Semester
courses to remain in the Far East
for productive work at nominal
costs.

Students interested in the pro-
gram for 1977 or 1978 may obtain
further information from Dr. Hill.

Two votes switch too late on eligibility amendment

(Continued from Page 1)
back in the running.

Peter Quinn, president of the
Sigma Phi Epsilon house, said his
house went against the amend-
ment because it was going
through the IFC too fast and they
didn’t quite understand the im-
plications of the change. Quinn
said less than an hour after the
meeting that he and the members
of his house were now in favor of
the more liberal eligibility rules.

of senior vice presidents to one.

There are now three vice-presi-
dents, one each for the science,
arts and commerce schools. Both
amendments were proposed by
Paul Larkin, senior E. C. repre-
sentative.

Posters around campus have er-
roneously stated that a proposed
amendment to allow the E.C. the
power to go into executive session
when questioning candidates for
committee posts will be on the
ballot.

That proposal was voted down
at Monday’s E.C. meeting.

Voting Regulations Board chair-
man Mike Powell has confirmed
that the amendment will not be on
the ballot.

Mime troupe performs
with student thespians

(Continued from page 2)

One look at the time demands

of the course will attest to the en-
thusiasm of those in it: 90 minutes
on weekday mornings, with an ad-
ditional 90 minutes on Monday
afternoons. And then a few hours
of rehearsal time every night for
the show. And (when all this was
over each day, this amazingly de-
dicated group of artists went back
to their apartments . . . and creat-
ed two mime productions especi-
ally for Washington and Lee, a
gift without price.

The two presentations are en-
titled “Kaleidoscope” and “Mara-
thon.” The first deals with images
of life as seen through children at
a playground. Original music for
“Kaleidoscope” is being composed
by June Morgan, recently seen as
Polly in Threepenny Opera. “Ma-
rathon” is the story of Phidipides,
the man who ran to Athens after
the Battles of Marathon in 490
B.C. Selections of music by Pink
Floyd will be used in this seg-
ment.

Reservations are necessary for
this show, and it should be re
membered that there are only
three performance nights, instead
of the usual six evenings. So calls
should be made early to the Uni-
versity Theatre box office at 463-
9111, ext. 371. The box office
opens next Monday morning, and
tickets are free for all members of
the W&L community. Also, tickets
must be picked up 24 hours before
the date of performance, or they
will be released to others.

The show, with set and lighting
design by Tom Ziegler and cos-
tume design by Al Gordon, begins
at 8 p.m. every night. It will serve
as the culmination of a marvelous
visit. The Poles and students to-
gether form an astonishing com-
pany—the latter, because they
have given themselves over tot-
ally to the tutelage and talent of
the former. For this university, it
is clear that a group with these
special talents may never come
around again. If you ever plan to
see the beauty of mime, March 23-
25 is your chance.

Sources said that after the meet-
ing Howdy Knipp of the Delta
Tau Delta house also said that he
would have voted for the amend-
ment if the effects had been clear.

Quinn and Knipp were both
candidates for IFC vice-president.

Jones said Tuesday night that
his only hope was for Robinson to
call two consecutive meetings
Wednesday night to take the two
votes necessary to make any
change in the constitution. Jones
and Mattesky both said Tuesday
they did not think Robinson would
do so.

Mattesky said the group voting
against the amendment was basic-
ally centered around a Phi Kappa
Sigma-Sigma Alpha Epsilon coali-
tion, and did not follow traditional
Red Square voting lines. Robinson
is a member of SAE and Sult, sec-
ond man in the first presidential
election, isa Phi Kap. .

Greer, representing Kappa Al-
pha, also voted against the
change.

Jones’s house, Phi Kappa Psi,
voted for the amendment.

Mattesky said that several of
the houses backing the eligibility
amendment were planning a meet-
ing before the IFC gathering Wed-
nesday night to come up with a
compromise candidate whom all
of the houses could back against
the Phi Kap-SAE nominee.

Robinson, a member of SAE,
said he accepted full blame for
Jones's ineligibility not being dis-
covered earlier. “I take total re-
sponsibility,” he said. “I wish it
had come to light before this.”

Jones admitted Tuesday night
that he had not read the IFC con-
stitution before running for presi-
dent of the organiation, but added
that apparently no one currently

for Monday after backers of Jones
pointed out that besides the late
discovery of Jones’s ineligibility,
the constitutional clause placing
the IFC elections on the same day
as the Big Three balloting was not
followed.

The new election will be held in
conjunction with the class officer
and E. C. voting next week.

In the vice-presidential ballot-
ing, also invalidated Tuesday
night, Knipp led with 156 votes,
Marshall Jemison followed with
129 and Quinn was the third man
with 103 votes.

Honor scholarship fund

set up anonymously

A $200,000 gift has been-made
to W&L by an anonymous benefac-
tor to establish a series of-Honor
Scholarships in memory of the
late Edward Charles Tonsmeire, a
prominent Mississippi banker and
attorney who died in 1972.

The Honor Scholarships will be
awarded to students whose rec-
ords demonstrate exceptional
character, achievement, and per-
sonal promise as well as financial
need.

Initially, preference will be giv-
en to students from the original
13 states. The scholarships will be
awarded to entering freshmen un-
dergraduates. Each _ recipient’s
scholarship will be renewable
throughout his undergraduate ca-

player, Richard Makepeace played
Ed Weiss in an exciting three set-
ter. But the close match went to
Weiss 46, 7-6, 6-3. At number six
David Constine played Jay Leven-
son with the latter taking the de-
cision, 6-3, 6-1. In an exhibition
match Pat Norris was defeated by
Dave Snyder 6-1, 6-4.

In the doubles, W&L lost all
three decisions but all the matches
were vigorously contested. At
number one doubles Davidson-Ir-
win over Johns-Jackson 6-2, 7-6.
At number two doubles Weiss-
Glouvehevitch over Voelker-Kees-
ler 6-4, 7-5 and at number three
doubles Snyder-Levenson edged
Makepeace-Shuford 6-3, 6-7, 7-6.

Though W&L lost this match
Coach Bussard was not worried.
As he says, “I expect us to have a
winning season. If I could sche-
dule twenty-five teams that I knew
were better than we were |
would.” In this way W&L’s fresh-
men can gain tough match experi-
ence to compete successfully in
the Division Il] NCAA tournament
(May 18-22). Meanwhile Bussard
is counting on Captain Ken Voel-
ker and number one man Ben
Johns to lead the way to a winning
season.
