The Woman’s Garden Club of
Virginia has offered a grant for
the addition of a terrace and other
landscaping to be added to Lee
Chapel.

The Club’s plans are part of
a statewide program to revisit
previous restorations and have al-
ready been accepted by the Board
of Trustees. Previous landscaping
vas done in 1933, when several
trees and shrubs were planted.

The present changes call for a
large, curved terrace in front of
the chapel, with three steps lead-
ing up to the campus, along with
the planting of trees, boxwoods
and ground cover around the
building. The walk leading up to
the Colonnade will be removed.

As nice as this sounds, the plan
is not without controversy. When
introduced to the Executive Com-
mittee Monday night, there was
a rather obvious air of displeasure
over the group when the artist’s
sketch of the landscaping was
passed around by E.C. member
Neil Pentifallo.

Pentifallo suggested that per-

in another way, but then the ques-

one could say no to such “a
handsome gift to the University.”

The E.C. decided to postpone
discussion until a later meeting,
but proposed that a survey of
student and faculty opinion be

Publication salary
debate postponed

By ROBERT CHIAVIELLO

At their regular Monday night
meeting the Executive Committee
decided to postpone discussion on
the issue of salaries for the edi-
tors and business managers of the
various campus publications.

E.C. Vice-president Sandy
Stradtman reported that certain
individuals, notably Bob Keefe,
director of publicity and editor of
the 1968 Ring-tum Phi, would be
unavailable because of extremely
busy schedules and that a con-
scientious decision could not be
made without their counsel. The
E.C. then passed a motion to
table the Publications Board in-
vestigation until November. They
did make it clear that the in-
vestigation would delve deeper
than just the salary issue. Both
the quality of the publications
and the method in which editors
are selected would be investigated.

President Tom Hunter opened
discussion on a report, made by
an ad hoc committee of the Uni-
versity Council, concerning recom-
mendations about the changed
relationship between the College
and the Law School.

The committee’s report recom
mended that another Law Student
representative be added to the
E.c., the three presidents of
the law classes serve on the
Student Control Committee, and
that two thirds of the tax money
collected from the Law School be
returned to the Student Bar As-
sociation.

This last proposal has already
been acted upon by the E.C.

Dave Cranshaw, law representa.
tive, said that the question of
allowing senior law students to
vote for the senior law school
representative was more  im-
portant, and that the E.C. ought
to make a decision on that matter
in time to put it on a referendum.

Also, the E.C. voted to put
before the student body a pro-
posal to change the freshman
elections from the third Monday
in October to the fourth Monday
of the Fall term. The referendum
will probably be held during the
big three elections in the winter
term.

Also, Stradtman announced that
the TV rooms of the University
Center had been vandalized and
that an investigation into the
matter would be carried out. He
asked that students be vigilant
and report any acts of vandalism
to Proctor Robert “Murph” Mur-
ray.

Finally the E.C. announced that
a poll of the student body would
be taken on the question of re-
instating the Winter break. The
survey will be taken on Thurs
day and Friday, October 14 and
15, and also the Monday of the
Freshman election October 18.

In other business the E.C. ap-
pointed nine persons to faculty
committee positions. The ap-
pointees and committees are:
Steve DiBiagio. Tom Kiegler and
Pete Williams, Athletic Commit-
tee; Freeman Jones, Brian Tray
and Trip Wornom, Health Com-
mittee, and Hugh Robinson, Jesse
O'Neil and Sean Smith, Library
Committee

 

Number 3

It had to happen! Dissatisfied with the wind-patterns beneath the footbridge, the Military Science depart-

ment has contracted for a large full-scale rapelling cliff to be built behind the campus, In order to dispel
fears of a military takeover of the campus, the project is being disguised as a library. Remember, you
read it first in the Ring-tum Phi...on second thought, forget it.

By JOHN HASTINGS

Since its founding in 1866, the
School of Law has been thought of
as a vital and cohesive part of the
W&L community. Recently, how-
ever, there have been some ques-
tions raised as to how integral a
part the Law School plays in life
at W&L.

In a recent interview Law
School Dean Roy Steinheimer dis-
pelled any thoughts of disunity,
saying he felt that the Law School
has a very definite role at the
University and that the law stu-
dents are under the jurisdiction
of Dean John just as any under-
graduate students are.

One of the main points of dis-
cussion was the possibility of a
separate Honor System for the

Law School. Steinheimer said, “T
feel that the University’s Honor
System is very applicable here at
the Law School. The standards are
the same for law students as
regular students.”

Steinheimer added that the onl:
recent changes in the Law School
are the new building and the new
location and that there are no
foreseeable changes on matters
concerning the University.

Last fall. the University Coun-
cil formed an ad hoc committee
to study the relationship between
the Law School and the under
graduate division. One of the
many suggestions that the ad hoc
committee made was that the
present Honor System be retained
as it is in the Law School.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

 

Thursday, October 7, 1976

Government
and The Press

The Executive Committee has tabled until sometime in
November all official discussion of a subject which is under-
standably important to all of us involved in student publica-
tions. The issue is whether or not to pay salaries to the editors
and business managers of the Ring-tum Phi and Calyx, and
to the editor of the Ariel, with money collected in the form of
the student tax.

The E.C. is looking into the matter with their usual dis-
patch. They are examining the operations of another Uni-
versity organization, the Publications Board, which is sup-
posed to have direct control over the three publications men-
tioned above, The Board is responsible for selecting editors
and business managers; it appropriates expenditures from its
own reserve fund for items deemed necessary to the publica-
tions (such as the $2,000 spent to renovate the darkroom,
lormerly a disaster area); most importantly, it stands be
tween the [.C. and student publications to insure the integrity
of what has been known historically as the “free press.”

However, according to the student body constitution, al]
Publications Board expenditures must be approved by the
student body treasurer, which means the vice-president. Ac-
the
managers of the Calyx and Ring-tum Phi are to
receive salaries of $200 and $150, plus 20% and 25% of outside

cording to the Publications Board constitution, editors

and business

(subseription and advertising) revenues, respectively. Now,
there are many good and bad arguments being offered both
for and against paying salaries to heads of student publications,
but that is a minor point. If the [E.C. is going to help fund
these publications (as they now must do, for several reasons :
we could not survive on outside revenue alone as it is cur
rently collected; all students receive the publications ree,
hence we should receive part of their tax money; the Board
of ‘Trustees tells them to), and is going to refuse to allocate
the
Publications Board reserve fund, as per its own constitution.

Rene C. McPherson

Rush can damage

By RANDY SMITH

Rush provides a lot of fun for
many students at W&L. But for
some students there is a dark side
to the proceedings that over-
shadows the carnival atmosphere.
For some freshmen, Rush is a
nightmare, a time of anxious an-
ticipation, a blow to their self-
esteem, Many take the setback in
stride and some are even openly
indifferent toward the fraternity
system. But in private, they may
feel alienated, disregarded; they
probably examine their personali-
ties for what must be a defct of
some kind (at least in someone’s
ties for what must be a defect of
mind). “What makes me differ-
ent?” they ask. “Why wasn’t I
good enough?”

There can be no doubt that go-
ing through Rush and not receiv-
ing a bid is a smite to one’s pride.

 

A bid is a symbol of acceptance in
a new and foreign environment.
To not receive a bid is to not be
accepted by social circles in this
socially-minded school.

A bid is an evaluation of worth.
How is one to react when no
evaluation—or a negative evalua
tion—is made and there is no
reinforcement o one’s worth? For
those whose worth has been qus-
tioned, a defeatist attitude is
easily taken.

People react to the letdown in
different ways. Some go _ into
seclusion and brood by themselves
for a while. Others bury them
selves in their studies and don’t
allow their minds to dwell on
“trivialities’ like bids and fra
ternities. Most find other students
in the same situation—they have
a common experience which bonds

Generals take command
Randolph - Macon defeated, 7-3

Head coach Bill McHenry called
it, “The most courageous de-
fensive performance I’ve ever
seen.” The players themselves
called it “super.” No matter how
it is referred to, the matter stands
that W&L won its first game of
the 1976 season, a hard fought 7-3
victory over conference foe Ran-
dolph-Macon. W&L is now 1-2 on
the year and 1-1 in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference.

The Randolph-Macon game,
played on W&L’s Wilson Field,
started in a treacherous downpour
that seemed to get progressively
worse as the game went on. The
weather minimized the capabili-
ties of both offensive units, and
was a main factor in the game’s
nine turnovers. Randolph-Macon,
now 0-3, was intercepted twice,
and fumbled six times losing four
of them. The Generals’ had three
turnovers all on fumbles.

The Randolph-Macon offense
was on the field for the majority
of the second half, running 47
plays from scrimmage to W&L’s
15. With their backs against the
wall time after time, the Gen-
erals defensive unit was more
than equal to the task. The only
Yellow Jacket score came on a
20 yard field goal by Bruce Kirk.
The General defense controlled
the game the remainder of the
way.

A key to the W&L victory,
their first over R-M since 1967,
was the punting of junior Phil
Bailey who averaged an outstand-
ing 38 yards a kick on seven
punts. Center Mark Duncan had
an excellent day snapping the ball
considering the weather condi-
tions. Linebackers Jeff Slatcoif
and Carl Foleik combined for 13
tackles and assisted on 16 others.

Game balls were awarded to
W&Ls co-captains, middle line-
backer Jeff Slatcoff and split end
Tony Perry, not only for their
performance in the game itself,
but also for their leadership
throughout the week preceeding
the game. McHenry noted, “This
win would never have been pos-
sible without the teams’ superior
mental attitude. The players
never doubted their ability to
win despite two earlier losses, and
I feel this is directly attributable
to the co-captains. Everybody
played like winners.”

While the taste of victory is
still being savored, the Generals

are spending the week preparing
for Saturday’s game with South-
western in Memphis, Tn. South-
western leads the series with eight
wins and a tie in fifteen meetings
SAM is 3-1 on the year and rid-
ing high after a 45-22 win over
Principia of Elsah, Ill. last week-
end. A win Saturday would give
Washington and Lee back to back
victories for the first time since
September of 1973 when they beat
Hamilton 29-7, and Centre 22-0 to
open the ’73 season.

For their play in the Randolph-
Macon game, junior co-captain
Jeff Slateoff, the middle line-
backer from Windber, Pa. was
named the teams’ defensive
player of the week. Slatcoff had
six solo tackles and assisted on
nine others. Sophomore Richard
Wiles, a flanker from Danville,

Va. was the Generals’ offensive
player of the week. Wiles caught
four Ted Hissey passes for 46
yards.
Leading Pass Receiver

Senior split end and co-captain
Tony Perry is now W&L’s all-time
leading pass receiver with 130
career receptions. He broke the
record of 127 held by Steve Ma-
haffey, W&L class of 1971.
Mahaffey led the nation with 74
receptions in the 1970 season.

Perry broke the mark with a
30 yard reception on a fly pattern
in the second quarter of the
Centre game on September 25th.
Ile also caught another Ted Hissey
pass against Centre, and two last
Saturday in the rain, to give him
a total of 130 catches. He has
seven games remaining in his

W&L career to add to that total.

day’s sloggy match on Wilson Field.

Soccer team gaining momentum

Coach Rolf Piranian’s soccer
Generals are on their way. After
a season-opening loss to con-
ference foe Eastern Mennonite,
the booters have won two of their
last three games. Included are a
6-1 win over Radford, and a 42
victory over UNC-Greensboro. The
Generals spent last weekend in
North Carolina, and in addition
to beating Greensboro, suffered a
6-0 loss at the hands of powerful
Guilford College.

The team has a big game at
home on Wednesday as they host
the University of Virginia. There

Sophomore Todd Tyson led the
way in the Radford win with two
goals. Piranian has been splitting
playing time between all three of
his goalies, and the tandem of
Mark Bennett and Reid Taylor
lost their shutout with eigh!
minutes remaining against Rad
ford. The six goals scored in the
game were the most scored by a

boro was largely
the play of sophomore Bill Stone
with the three goal hat trick.
Junior Jim Veghte recorded the
fourth W&L goal and assisted on
one of Stone’s tallies. The win
over Greensboro was especially
rewarding as the Generals came
from behind to clinch it. Piranian
called it, “An all-out team effort.’

After four games W&L’s lead-
ing scorer is Bill Stone with four
goals and an assist for nine points
(two points awarded for a goal,
one for an assist). Todd Tyson is
next with four points on two
goals.

reference and public services di-
vision, when Miss Brown was on a
year-long leave of absence under
a grant from the Council On
Library Resources Inc.

Mrs. Kondayan is a member of
several state and regional! library
associations. Among her recent
research activities has been a de-
tailed investigation of the library
holdings of Liberty Hall Academy,
Washington and Lee’s 18th-cen-
tury predecessor institution. The
result is a scholarly article which
will be published shortly in The
Virginia Magazine Of History And
Biography.

Miss Brown, whose title at
Prineeton is to be assistant uni-
versity librarian for general

reader services, will have a staff
of 45 under her direction, includ-
ing 18 professional librarians.
Among the several academic li-
braries for which she will have
administrative responsibility is
the Woodrow Wilson Library of

Princeton’s famed political science
and foreign service school.

She joined W&L’s library staff
in 1971, after seven years in the
library at Cornell University. She
is a graduate in English of lowa
State University and received her
master’s degree in library science
from Columbia. .

The Council on Library Re-
sources grant she received in 1974
was one of just five awarded in
the nation to mid-career librarians
judged to possess ‘exceptional
management potential.” She spent
her year “shadowing” Page Aker-
man, then the head librarian at
the University of California at
Los Angeles (UCLA),

Miss Brown is chairman of the
board of Shenandoah, Washington
and Lee’s literary quarterly, di-
rector of the Rockbridge Concert-
Theatre Series, and a member of
the Rockbridge Chorus. Last May
she received the “Ring-tum Phi
Award” for extraordinary dedica
tion to the university and its stu-
dent body.

men have already pledged them-
selves to a house (or at least have
received a bid sometime during
the Rush process), it may be
proper for fraternity members to
give a passing thought to those
who got relatively little out of
Rush. It must be remembered that
the unsettling experience of not
receiving a bid can be a depress-
ing one and damaging to the ego.
Keep “them” in mind when you
are enthusiastically discussing fra-
ternity life with a member of
your pledge class and one of
“them” passes by. It is only gentle-
manly not to abuse the self
esteem of one who has already
been passed over in the social
cirele of his new environment.

New law scholarship established

The Berwind Corp. of Phila-
delphia has made a $25,000 gift
here to establish an endowed
honor scholarship fund in the uni-
versity’s School of Law.

The gift was made in memory
of the late Zeb Hamill Herndon,
a 1927 W&L graduate who was
vice president of Berwind and
president of its West Virginia
subsidiary, Berwind Land Corp.,
until his retirement in 1972. Mr.
Herndon died last winter.

The Berwind gift will provide
honor scholarships to outstanding
law students at Washington and
Lee who are residents of West
Virginia, with first preference be-
ing given to students from Welch,
where Mr, Herndon was born

and spent the first hal? of his life,
The new endowment will also
help Washington and Lee meet a
$150,009 challenge grant from the
Claude Worington Benedum
Foundation. That grant is design-
ated to provide financial assist-
ance to out:tanding law students
from West Virginia generally.

Ater his graduation heve, Mr.
Herndon earned his LL.B. degree
rom West Virginia University and
engaged in the private practice
of law in Welch until 1941. His
law partner was Thornton G.
Berry Jr., a fellow W&L alumnus
who is now chief justice of the
West Virginia Supreme Court of
Appeals.
